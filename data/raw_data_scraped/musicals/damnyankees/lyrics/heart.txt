Heart


[VAN BUREN]

You've gotta have heart

All you really need is heart

When the odds are sayin' you'll never win

That's when the grin should start

You've gotta have hope

Mustn't sit around and mope

Nothin's half as bad as it may appear

Wait'll next year and hope

When your luck is battin' zero

Get your chin up off the floor

Mister you can be a hero

You can open any door, there's nothin' to it but to do it

You've gotta have heart

Miles 'n miles n' miles of heart

Oh, it's fine to be a genius of course

But keep that old horse

Before the cart

First you've gotta have heart



[ROCKY]

A great slugger we haven't got



[SMOKEY]

[VERNON]

A great ball club we haven't got



[ROCKY, SMOKEY & VERNON]

We've got heart

All you really need is heart

When the odds are sayin' you'll never win

That's when the grin should start



[ROCKY, SMOKEY, LINVILLE]

We've got hope

We don't sit around and mope

Not a solitary sob do wwe heave

Mister, 'cause we've got hope

[ROCKY]

We've gotta get better, 'cause we can't get worse!



[ALL]

And to add to it, we've got heart

We've got heart

We've got heart



We've got heart

All you really need is heart

When the odds are sayin' you'll never win

That's when the grin should start

Oh, it's fine to be a genius of course

But keep that old horse

Before the cart
