Six Months Out of Every Year


[MEG]

When we met in nineteen thirty-eight, it was November,

When I said that I would be his mate, it was December.

I reasoned he would be the greatest husband that a girl had ever found.

That's what I reasoned,

That's what I reasoned.

Then April rolled around.



[JOE]

Strike three, ball four, walk a run'll tie the score,

Yer blind Ump,

Yer blind Ump,

Ya mus' be out-a yer mind, Ump!



[MEG]

Six months out of every year,

I might as well be made of stone.

Six months out of every year when I'm with him,

I'm alone



[JOE]

He caught the corner



[MEG]

Six months out of every year,

He doesn't take me anywhere.

Six months out of every year, when I play cards,

Solitaire.



The other six months out of every year

We are hardly ever seen apart

But then the Washington Senators take over my place in his heart.



Six months out of every year,

I might as well be wearing crepe.

Life is just an awful bore,

from which I find no escape



Six months out of every year.



[BOYS]

Strike three, ball four,

walk, a run'll tie the score.

Fly ball,double play,

Yankees win again today!

Those damn Yankees,

Why can't we beat 'em?

He's out, He's safe, he's out, he's safe, he's out, he's safe, he's out!



Yer blind Ump,

Yer blind Ump,

Ya must be out-a yer mind, Ump!



[GIRLS]

Six months out of every year,

He lives by the television set.



[BOYS]

He's out, he's safe, he's out!



[GIRLS]

If you see that man of mine;

How does he look?

I forget.



[BOYS]

Le-e-ets go!



[GIRLS]

Six months out of every year,

We know there is no other dame.

If he isn't home by six,



[BOYS]

He's out, he's safe, he's out!



[GIRLS]

It's six to one

There's a game.



[BOYS]

Le-e-ets go!



[GIRLS]

Six months out of every year,

When we cook for them it never pays.



[BOYS]

Aahh!



[GIRLS]

Instead of praising our ghoulash,

They're appraising the plays of Willie Mays!



[BOYS]

He's out, He's safe, he's out, he's safe, he's safe, he's out he's safe, he's out?!

(simultaneous:)

[GIRLS]

Six months out of every year,



[BOYS]

Strike three, ball four, walk a run'll tie the score



[GIRLS]

We might as well be wearing crepe.



[BOYS]

Fly ball double play,

Yankees win again today!



[GIRLS]

Life is just an awful bore

From which I find no escape.



[BOYS]

Those damn Yankees!

Why can't we beat 'em,

He's out, He's safe, he's out, he's safe, he's out, he's safe, he's out!

Yer blind Ump,

Yer blind Ump,

Ya must be out-a yer mind, Ump!



[GIRLS]

We're dying for the mercury to drop to three below,



[BOYS]

Le-et's go!



[GIRLS]

We're crying for the happy days of icicicles and snow



[BOYS]

Le-et's go!



[GIRLS]

We don't mind sleeping solo,

That is once a year or so.



[BOYS]

Those damn Yankees!



[GIRLS]

But with them it's a career.



{splits again}

[BOYS]

What are we waitn' for?

April, May, June, July, August,



[GIRLS]

Men!



[BOYS]

September.



[GIRLS]

Bah!

April, May, June, July, August,



[BOYS]

Slide!



[GIRLS]

[BOYS]

Ooh!



{simultaneous:}

[GIRLS]

Six months out of every year!



[BOYS]

Six months out of every year!

Yer blind Ump, Yer blind Ump,

Ya must be out of yer mind Ump! year!



[ALL]

April, May, June, July, August, September.

April, May, June, July, August, September.



[MEG]

Six months out of every
