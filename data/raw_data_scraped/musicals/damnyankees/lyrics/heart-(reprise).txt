Heart (Reprise)


[FAN CLUB]

You've gotta have heart

All you really need is heart

When the odds are sayin' you'll never win

That's when the grin should start



[CHERRY]

When your luck is battin' zero



[SISTER]

Get your chin up off the floor



[RONNIE]

Mister you can be a hero



[JACKIE]

You can open any door, there's nothin' to it but to do it



[ALL]

You've gotta have heart

Miles 'n miles n' miles of heart

Oh, it's fine to be a genius of course

But keep that old horse before the cart



[CHERRY]

So when the bases are loaded



[JACKIE & RONNIE]

The count is three and two



[SISTER]

You'll hit a homer, Joe, we can depend on you



[ALL]

You're a hero 'cause, you've got heart

You've got heart-

You've got heart-
