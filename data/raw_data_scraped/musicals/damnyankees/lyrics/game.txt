Game


[ROCKY]

we've got to think about the game!



[ALL]

The game, the game!

We've go to think about the game,

The game, the game!

Booze and braods may be great,

though they're great they'll have to wait,

While we think about the game!



[ROCKY]

There was that waitress back in Kansas City,

Built for comfort, dumb but pretty!



[ALL]

Yeah? Yeah?



[ROCKY]

Man, her perfume sure smelt sweet,

Got her up to my hotel suite!



[ALL]

Yeah? Yeah?



[ROCKY]

She killed a pint of gin more or less,

The lights were low and she slips of her dress!



[ALL]

Yeah? Yeah? Yeah? Yeah?



[ROCKY]

But then I thought about the game!



[ALL]

The game, the game!



[ROCKY]

Oh, yes, I thought about the game!



[ALL]

The game, the game!



[ROCKY]

Though I got the lady high,

I just left her high and dry,

Cause I thought about the game!



[ALL]

He thought about the game!



[SMOKEY]

There was that pullman car that I got lost in,

On a sleeper out of Boston!



[ALL]

Yeah? Yeah?



[SMOKEY]

Compartment doors all look the same there

Walked in one and there's this dame there!



[ALL]

Yeah? Yeah?



[SMOKEY]

Blonde, and stacked, and absolutely bare,

And nothin' separatin' us but air!



[ALL]

Yeah? Yeah? Yeah? Yeah?



[SMOKEY]

But then I thought about the game!



[ALL]

The game, the game!



[SMOKEY]

Oh, yes, I thought about the game!



[ALL]

The game, the game!



[SMOKEY]

Though my heart said stay for tea,

All I said was pardon me!

Cause I though about the game!



[ALL]

He thought about the game!



[MICKEY]

When a chick gives you the eye, remember-



[ALL]

Abstain!



[LOWE]

When you're dyin' for some rye, remember-



[ALL]

Refrain!



[HENRY]

If you're losin' at crap and the clock says it's eleven,

Ans suddenly each roll you roll-"huh"- comes up a seven,

And you're in the kind of dive, where men are men,



[ALL]

Be polite, say goodnight, you should be in bed by ten!



[SMOKEY]

When your mother bakes you cakes, remember-



[ALL]

Saty thin!



[ROCKY]

When you're kissin' till it aches, remember-



[ALL]

Don't give in!

Every rule we shall obey to be sure,

Cause to win we've gotta stay, good and pure,

Good and pure! Mumm.



[SMOKEY]

Hey, Rock, remember those twins we took a ride with,

Operatin' side by side with,



[ALL]

Yeah? Yeah?



[SOMKEY]

We're out of gas three miles from Philly,



[ROCKY]

The night is warm, the sky's a dilly,



[ALL]

Yeah? Yeah?



So I suggest we sleep beneath a tree



[ROCKY]

Four minds with a single thought



[SMOKEY]

I look at my girl,



[ROCKY]

I look at mine



[SMOKEY]

Then with one fell swoop-



[ALL]

But then they thought about the game!

The game, the game!



[ROCKY & SMOKEY]

Oh, yes, we thought about the game!



[ALL]

The game, the game!

to our women one and all,

We will see you in the fall,

But for now we've got to stall,

Every dame!

And think about the game!

Think about the game,

Think about the, think about the, think about the, think about the,

Think about the game!
