Man Doesn't Know


[JOE]

A man doesn't know what he has until he loses it,

When a man has the love of a woman he abuses it,

I didn't know what I had when I had my old love,

I didn't know what I had 'till I said, "Goodbye, old love!"

Yes, a man doesn't know what he has 'til it is no longer around

But the happy thought is

Whatever it is he's lost, may some day once again be found!
