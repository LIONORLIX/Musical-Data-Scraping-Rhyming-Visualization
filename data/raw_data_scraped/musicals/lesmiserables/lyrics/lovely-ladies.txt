Lovely Ladies


[The docks. Sailors, whores and their customers, pimps, etc. Fantine wanders in]



[SAILOR ONE]

I smell women

Smell 'em in the air

Think I'll drop my anchor

In that harbor over there



[SAILOR TWO]

Lovely ladies

Smell 'em through the smoke

Seven days at sea

Can make you hungry for a poke



[SAILOR THREE]

Even stokers need a little stoke!



[WOMEN]

Lovely ladies

Waiting for a bite

Waiting for the customers

Who only come at night

Lovely ladies

Ready for the call

Standing up or lying down

Or any way at all

Bargain prices up against the wall



[OLD WOMAN]

Come here, my dear

Let's see this trinket you wear

This bagatelle...



[FANTINE]

Madame, I'll sell it to you...



[OLD WOMAN]

I'll give you four



[FANTINE]

That wouldn't pay for the chain!



[OLD WOMAN]

I'll give you five. You're far to eager to sell.

It's up to you.



[FANTINE]

It's all I have



[OLD WOMAN]

That's not my fault



[FANTINE]



[OLD WOMAN]

No more than five

My dear, we all must stay alive!



[WOMEN]

Lovely ladies

Waiting in the dark

Ready for a thick one

Or a quick one in the park

Whore 1

Long time short time

Any time, my dear

Cost a little extra if you want to take all year!



[ALL]

Quick and cheap is underneath the pier!



[CRONE]

What pretty hair!

What pretty locks you got there

What luck you got. It's worth a centime, my dear

I'll take the lot



[FANTINE]

Don't touch me! Leave me alone!



[CRONE]

Let's make a price.

I'll give you all of ten francs,

Just think of that!



[FANTINE]

It pays a debt



[CRONE]

Just think of that



[FANTINE]

What can I do? It pays a debt.

Ten francs may save my poor Cosette!



[SAILOR THREE]

Lovely lady!

Fastest on the street

Wasn't there three minutes

She was back up on her feet



[SAILOR ONE]

Lovely lady!

What yer waiting for?

Doesn't take a lot of savvy

Just to be a whore

Come on, lady

What's a lady for?



[Fantine re-emerges, her long hair cut short]



[PIMP]

Give me the dirt, who's that bit over there?



[WHORE ONE]

A bit of skirt. She's the one sold her hair.



[WHORE TWO]

She's got a kid. Sends her all that she can



[PIMP]

I might have known

There is always some man

Lovely lady, come along and join us!

Lovely lady!



[WHORE ONE]

Come on dearie, why all the fuss?

You're no grander than the rest of us

Life has dropped you at the bottom of the heap

Join your sisters



[WHORE TWO]

Make money in your sleep!



[Fantine goes off with one of the sailors]



[WHORE ONE]

That's right dearie, let him have the lot



[WHORE THREE]

That's right dearie, show him what you've got!



[WOMEN]

Old men, young men, take 'em as they come

Harbor rats and alley cats and every kind of scum

Poor men, rich men, leaders of the land

See them with their trousers off they're never quite as grand

All it takes is money in your hand!



Lovely ladies

Going for a song

Got a lot of callers

But they never stay for long



[FANTINE]

Come on, Captain,

you can wear your shoes

Don't it make a change

To have a girl who can't refuse

Easy money

Lying on a bed

Just as well they never see

The hate that's in your head

Don't they know they're making love

To one already dead!



[BAMATABOIS]

Here's something new. I think I'll give it a try.

Come closer you! I like to see what I buy...

The usual price, for just a slice of your pie



[FANTINE]

I don't want you. No, no, m'sieur, let me go.



[BAMATABOIS]

Is this a trick? I won't pay more!



[FANTINE]

No, not at all.



[BAMATABOIS]

You've got some nerve, you little whore

You've got some gall.

It's the same with a tart as it is with a grocer

The customer sees what he gets in advance

It's not for the whore to say `yes sir' or `no sir'

It's not for the harlot to pick and to choose

Or lead me to a dance!



[He hits her with his stick, she claws at his face, drawing blood]



[FANTINE]

I'll kill you, you bastard,

try any of that!

Even a whore who has gone to the bad

Won't be had by a rat!



[BAMATABOIS]

By Christ you'll pay for what you've done

This rat will make you bleed, you'll see!

I guarantee, I'll make you suffer

For this disturbance of the peace

For this insult to life and property!



[FANTINE]

I beg you, don't report me sir

I'll do whatever you may want



[BAMATABOIS]

Make your excuse to the police!



[Javert enters, accompanied by constables]



[JAVERT]

Tell me quickly what's the story

Who saw what and why and where

Let him give a full description

Let him answer to Javert!

In this nest of whores and vipers

Let one speak who saw it all

Who laid hands on this good man here?

What's the substance of this brawl?



[BAMATABOIS]

Javert, would you believe it

I was crossing from the park

When this prostitute attacked me

You can see she left her mark



[JAVERT]

She will answer for her actions

When you make a full report

You may rest assured, M'sieur,

That she will answer to the court.



[FANTINE]

There's a child who sorely needs me

Please M'sieur, she's but that high

Holy God, is there no mercy?

If I go to jail she'll die!



[JAVERT]

I have heard such protestations

Every day for twenty years

Let's have no more explanations

Save your breath and save your tears

`Honest work, just reward,

That's the way to please the Lord.'



[Fantine gives a last despairing cry as she is arrested by the constables.

Valjean emerges from the crowd]



[VALJEAN]

A moment of your time, Javert

I do believe this woman's tale



[JAVERT]



[VALJEAN]

You've done your duty, let her be

She needs a doctor, not a jail.



[JAVERT]

But M'sieur Mayor!



[FANTINE]

Can this be?



[VALJEAN]

Where will she end -

This child without a friend?



I've seen your face before

Show me some way to help you

How have you come to grief

In a place such as this?



[FANTINE]

M'sieur, don't mock me now, I pray

It's hard enough I've lost my pride

You let your foreman send me away

Yes, you were there, and turned aside

I never did no wrong



[VALJEAN]

Is it true, what I have done?



[FANTINE]

My daughter's close to dying...



[VALJEAN]

To an innocent soul?



[FANTINE]

If there's a God above



[VALJEAN]

Had I only known then...



[FANTINE]

He'd let me die instead



[VALJEAN]

In His name my task has just begun

I will see it done!



[JAVERT]

But M'sieur Mayor!



[VALJEAN]

I will see it done!



[JAVERT]

But M'sieur Mayor!



[VALJEAN]

I will see it done!



[VOICES]

Look out! It's a runaway cart!



[A man is trapped under a cart. Valjean (Monsieur Mayor) saves the man]



[JAVERT]



Can this be true?

I don't believe what I see

A man your age

To be as strong as you are

A memory stirs

You make me think of a man

From years ago

A man who broke his parole

He disappeared

Forgive me sir I would not dare.



[VALJEAN]



Say what you must

Don't leave it there



[JAVERT]



I have only known one other

Who can do what you have done

He's a convict from the chain gang

He's been ten years on the run

But he couldn't run forever

We have found his hideaway

And he's just been rearrested

And he comes to court today

Well of course he now denies it

You'd expect that of a con

But he couldn't run forever

No not even Jean Valjean



[VALJEAN]



You say this man denies it all

With no sign of understanding or repentance

And that's he's sure to be returned

To serve his sentence?

Come to that, can you be sure

That you have got your man?



I have known the thief for ages

Tracked him down through thick and thin

And to make the matter certain

There's the brand upon his skin

He will bend, he will break

This time there is no mistake!



[Javert Leaves]
