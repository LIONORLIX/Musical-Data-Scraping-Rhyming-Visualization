I Met A Girl


JEFF

I met a girl,

A wonderful girl,

She's really got a lot to recommend her for a girl,

A fabulous creature, without any doubt.

Hey, what am I getting so excited about?

She's just a girl,

An everyday girl,

And yet I guess she's really rather special for a

girl,

For once you have seen her, the others are out.

Hey, what am I getting so excited about?

But so what?

What has she got

Others have not?

Two eyes, two lips, a nose,

Most girls have some of those.

And yet, when she

Looks up at me,

What do I see?

The most enchanting face,

My pulse begins to race.

Hey!

I met a girl,

A marvelous girl,

She's rarer than uranium and fairer than a pearl.

I found me a treasure and I want to shout:

This is what I'm getting so excited about!

I met a girl

And I fell in love today!



CHORUS

He met a girl.

He met a girl.

He met a girl,

A wonderful girl,

A marvelous girl,

A fabulous girl,

A super-sensational girl!

He met a girl,

A wonderful girl,

She's really got a lot to recommend her for a girl,

A fabulous creature, without any doubt.



JEFF

Hey, what am I getting so excited about?



CHORUS

No everyday girl,

A wonderful girl,

A really marvelous girl,

An utterly fabulous creature, without any doubt.

This is what he's excited about!



JEFF

But so what?

What has she got

Others have not?



CHORUS

Two eyes, lips, nose,

All girls have those.



JEFF

And yet, when she

Looks up at me...



CHORUS

What does he see?

The most enchanting face,

His heart keeps beating faster,

And faster, and faster,

It goes BANG!



JEFF

I met a girl,

A marvelous girl.



CHORUS

She's rarer than uranium and fairer than a pearl.



JEFF

I found me a treasure and I want to shout:



CHORUS

This is what he's getting so excited about!

He met a girl,

Such a wonderful girl,

He met a girl

And he fell in love today!

He met a girl!
