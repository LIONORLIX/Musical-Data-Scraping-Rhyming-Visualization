You've Got to Do It


You've gotta do it, you've gotta do it,

Gotta do it all alone.

No one else will do it for you,

You're on your own.



Do it.

It may be love or war or mopping up the floor, but just do it.

Don't send a friend who's true to pitch your woo for you or you'll

rue it.

Do it yourself.



Don't Fake it.

If You're a fake, you won't make it,

Wait for your break, and then take it,

For time and tide they wait for no man, go, go, go, man.



Do it.

To prove the point at hand just look at old Miles Standish who blew

it,

He said "John Alden, will you go and ask Priscilla to do it?"

Miles got the heaveho.



"Man," Priscilla said, "Now that Miles is gone,

Speak for yourself, dear John."

He blew it, so do it, do it,

Do it yourself.
