The Midas Touch


Aaaahhhhhhh!

First you're hot and then you're cold

Then you're shy and then you're bold

But I'm always sensitive to you



First you fill my heart with pain

Then your kiss is novocaine

That's no way sensitive to you



You don't see anything, but it hurts

Though you can't see the pain

Ooh-oh, how it hurts



Midas touch

The mighty, mighty, mighty, mighty Midas Touch

The Midas touch

The mighty, mighty, mighty, mighty Midas Touch

Midas touch

The mighty, mighty Midas Touch



Gold in the mornin'

Gold in the evenin

Gold in the Summer

Gold in the Winter

Doctor Midas said to me

"Be sure you take your vitamin G...O...L...D"

And that's what he said to me

Yeah!



(Musical Interlude + Ad-Lib Vocal Noises)



Gold in all its glory

And that's the story of the Midas Touch
