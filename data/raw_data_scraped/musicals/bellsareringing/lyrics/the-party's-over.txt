The Party's Over


The party's over, it's time to call it a day

No matter how you pretend

You knew it would end this way

It's time to wind up the masquerade

Just make your mind up

The piper must be paid



The party's over, the candles flicker and dim

You've danced and dreamed through the night

It seemed to be right just being with him

Now you must wake up, all dreams must end

Take off your makeup, the party's over

It's all over, my friend



La-da-da-da-da, la-da-da-da-da

You danced and dreamed through the night

It seemed to be right just being with him

Now you must wake up, all dreams must end

Take off your makeup, the party's over
