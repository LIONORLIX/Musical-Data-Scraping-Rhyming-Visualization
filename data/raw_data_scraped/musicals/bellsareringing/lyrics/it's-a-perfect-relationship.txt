It's A Perfect Relationship


ELLA

It's crazy,

Ridiculous,

It doesn't make sense.

That's true,

But what can I do?



I'm in love with a man,

Plaza 0-double-4-double-3.

It's a perfect relationship:

I can't see him, he can't see me.

I'm in love with a voice,

Plaza 0-double-4-double-3.

What a perfect relationship:

I talk to him and he just talks to me.

And yet I can't help wondering:

What does he look like?

I wish I knew.

What does he look like?

Is he six-foot-seven or three-foot two?

Has he eyes of brown or baby blue?

Big and mighty or underfed?

Trim black mustache or beard of red?

Can he dance like Fred Astaire?

Is he dark or is he fair?

Pompadour or not a hair?

Well, I don't care!

I'm in love with a man,

Plaza 0-double-4-double-3.

What a perfect relationship!

And that's how things should always be,

Our love can never lose its mystery,

'Cause I'll never meet him

And he'll never meet me.

No, he'll never meet me.



What does he look like?

My sleeping prince?

What does he look like?

He could be the fat and balding type,

Or rugged tweed with a briar pipe,

Big thick glasses, super mind,

Or the sweet poetic kind,

It doesn't matter what he is -

I'm his, his, his!

But he's still just a voice,

Plaza 0-double-4-double-3.

What a perfect relationship!

I can't see him, he can't see me,

He calls me "Mom," he thinks I'm sixty-three,

And I'll never meet him

And he'll never meet me.

No, he'll never meet me.
