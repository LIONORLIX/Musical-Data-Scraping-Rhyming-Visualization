Sue:

You said it!

You said it!

I heard you say it!

Oh Sandor!



Sandor:

Sue, Sue, Sue, I Love you, honey.

Sue, Sue, Sue, Give me your money.

With your life savings in the little blue sock,



Sue:

We will have enough to keep us out of hock.



Sandor

We'll fly together to a place I know where we, oh so happy will be.



Sue:

Oh, Where, Oh where is this place of mystery?



Sandor

(spoken) Where?



Sandor:

In Salzburg by the sea,

Where love and laughter live eternally.

In Salzburg by the h ill,

Where gondolas go gliding by the mill



Sue:

What a thrill darling!



Sandor

Tropical nights



Sue:

Festival lights



Sandor

Strudel for two at the midnight bull fights.



Sue

Arriba!



Sandor

In Salburg, Lovely Salburg

Where the flying fishes play

Where the schnitzel is high as an elephant's eyes

And the skies are not cloudy all day.

Come to Salzburg with me...

(spoken) Liebchen!

By the sea!



Both

O-le!



Sandor

(spoken) Come on, Sue.



Sue

(spoken) Oh, Sandor, Tell me more!



Sandor

(spoken) You want more?



Sandor

In Salzburg by the sea



Sue

You said it!



Sandor

Where all the worlds in love with gay Paree



Sue:

You said you love me!



Sandor:

In Salzburg on the shore



Sue:

He loves me!



Sandor:

Where Geisha girls keep coming back for more



Sue:

(spoken) Sandor!



Sandor:

(spoken) Liebchen



Sue:

We'll live in style



Sandor:

Gold by the pile



Both:

Goulash for two as we barge down the Nile.

In Salburg, Lovely Salzburg



Sandor:

Where the corn and 'taters grow.



Sue:



In our sweet home sweet home all the roads lead to Rome,



Both:

So, my darling,

Let's hurry and go!



Sandor:

Come to Salzburg with me

(spoken) Liebchen!



Both:

By the sea.

O-le!
