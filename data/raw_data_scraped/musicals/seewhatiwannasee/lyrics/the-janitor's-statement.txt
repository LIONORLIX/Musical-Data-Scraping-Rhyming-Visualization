A janitor?



The Janitor: (spoken)

At the the movie house.

Big Premiere. Japanese pic.

Didnt get out till five which makes it Sunday morning.

Took my usual shorcut home through the park,

I told ya.



(sung)

So whatcha want me to say?

I told ya all that I know.

I told ya all that I'd seen.

I only told ya the truth.

The park.

A scarf.

A body.

The blood.



(spoken)

I didn't see any knife.

His knife, probably...



Police officer: (spoken)

His?



The Janitor: (spoken)

I mean whoever did it, with the knife you keep talking about, which I didn't see.



(sung)

I only told ya the truth.
