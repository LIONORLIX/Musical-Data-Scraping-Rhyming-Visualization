The First Message


The Priest: (spoken)

Aunt Monica was right all along.

But I believed that I'd been called to Christ.

Gullible dope.

And the world is full of gullible dopes.



(sung)

Light in the east.

Got a new day.

If you listen you can hear it

Miles and miles away...



(spoken)

Central Park.

So big.

So central.

People expect to much from their faith.

They cry for absolution as if they'd know what to do with it, even if they had it.

They want from me absolution.

Miracles.

Christ.

What if...

Christ.

All right...

Then I'll give you Christ...



(sung)

"In three weeks

On Tuesday

At one P.M. sharp

A miracle will occur

Here in Central Park,

Before our very eyes,

From the depths of the pond

Christ will rise!

Believe

And be free!

Believe and be free!"



There you go, folks.

There's your miracle.

Enjoy.
