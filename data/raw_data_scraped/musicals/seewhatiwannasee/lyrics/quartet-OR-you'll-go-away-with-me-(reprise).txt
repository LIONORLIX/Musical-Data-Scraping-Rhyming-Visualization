Quartet / You'll Go Away With Me (Reprise)


The Husband: (spoken)

Okay, I was stupid.

I shouldn't have trusted the guy.



(sung)

Big money

Hidden in the boathouse.

Hot money

Somewhere in the dark.

My money.

Had trust a stranger

Hell, I knew the danger

When we hit the park...



(spoken)

She went with him. Oh she was afraid, my wife, my Lily, but she...Went with him. Like as though she had always wanted to. I tried to think about something else, rain my mind on something other than their...lovemaking. I thought about the movie that I'd seen that night: Rashomon. Rashomon. Such a beautiful film. The marquee outside the theatre was missing an "a" from the title, so it spelled "R shomon." Where had the "a" on the marquee gone? Gone...

"A" for anger.

Ambition.



(sung)

Andrew sisters

America...



The Wife/The Theif: (sung)

I'll go away with you (you'll go away with me)

I don't care where (you know you will)



The Husband/The Medium:

Alarm



The Wife/The Theif: (sung)

I'll go away with you (you'll go away with me)

And not look back.



The Husband/The Medium: (sung)

Amnesia.



The Wife/The Theif: (sung)

Does the sun really rise in the east?



The Husband/The Medium: (sung)

Actress



The Wife/The Theif: (sung)

Does the earth really spin around the sun?



The Husband/The Medium: (sung)

Asshole



The Wife/The Theif: (sung)

What's it matter in the least? (It don't matter)

What's real for me ain't real for everyone.

I want to stay with you (stay with me)

I don't have a choice. (you know you do)



The Husband/The Medium: (sung)

Abandoned. Annulment.



The Wife: (sung)

You took away my right

To think and choose--



The Theif: (sung)

You know the truth.



The Husband/The Medium: (sung)

Adultery. Ambivalence. Ache. Abase.



The Wife/The Theif: (sung)

You knew what I needed.

You knew what I wanted to find.



The Husband/The Medium: (sung)

Art. Artifice. All gone.



The Wife/The Theif: (sung)

I'll go away with you (you'll go away with me)



The Husband/The Medium: (sung)

Gone.



The Wife/The Theif: (sung)

And leave what was

Behind.



The Husband/The Medium: (sung)

Gone...gone...
