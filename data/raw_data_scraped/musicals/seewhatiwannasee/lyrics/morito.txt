Morito


Morito: (sung)

Tonight I kiss my lover

For the last time.

I go to her at midnight;

Slipping past the gate,

Floating to her bed.

I let her hand caress me

For the last time.



I knife into her body

Forcibly and proud;

She says that I'm incredibly endowed.

(Thicker than her husband.)

And as I kiss my lover

For the last time,

The world dissolves

Around me

I desert my body

All of time is one.

Dusk is dawn;

Dawn is noon;

Late is now;

Now is soon.

This is what it's like to be God.



I watch myself outside myself:

Sleep and breathe and wake and cry,

Sweat and shit and screw and lie;

My God, it's hell to be God.



Watching form a distance,

I neither laugh nor cry.

As the floodgates are opened

And the innocent die

A lie becomes the truth

And the truth becomes a lie.

Lie...

Lie.

Tonight I kiss my lover

For the last time.



She'll feel my hands about her,

Tight around her throat;

I'll end my lover's life.



And I'll return to my body;

To my bones, to my skin;

What I've set in motion

Cannot be reversed

Time will begin.

Time...

Time...

Time!
