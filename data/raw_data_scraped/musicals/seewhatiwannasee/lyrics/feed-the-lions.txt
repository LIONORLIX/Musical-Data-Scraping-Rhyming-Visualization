Feed the Lions


The Priest: (sung)

In one hour.

On this day.

T-shirts.

Funny hats.



(spoken)

It's time!



(sung)

The greatest practical joke

Played on the common folk

Is God!



(spoken)

Aunt Monie would love all the celebrities!



(sung)

Diane Sawyer!

Jesse Jackson!

Stephen Kind and

Oprah Winfrey!

Al Pacino!

Over there!

Look!

It's Cher!



CPA: (spoken)

Father, I know what you are:

You can't fool me, oh no you can't.

I know that you are an angel-

All that has been lost will be found;

And today,

Today, my God will see me again!



The Priest: (sung)

There's Pete Hamill.

And Mark Hamill.

Dorothy Hamill.

Donny Osmond.

And his fam'ly;

Joining them

Eminem!



The Actress: (spoken)

Hey! I've been looking for you!

It's me: Deanna! Me. (laughs)

I just wanted to tell you that I've been thinking about you

And how nice and how decent you were

And because I met you

And because you believed that this whole fantastic thing could happen,

Well, it moved me.

It really really moved me and...

For the first time in, I don't know, fucking forever,

I'm so, what? Hungry. No-no-no, not hungry, I mean.

Yeah. Clean. Really really really clean.

And actually, hungry, too! (laughs)

Thank you! Thank you, thank you, thank you!



The Priest: (sung)

A solemn veneer

Barely covers their panic;

A roster that leads

Like a modern Titanic.

Won't it be fun

To watch them all drown?

The mighty and weak

Sucked in and pulled down.

The Dalai Lama's lawyer!

The mayor's ex-wife!

Milk-fed Christians!

Worried Jews!

Fragile Muslims!

Hopeful Hindus!

Diane Sawyer!

Jesse Jackson!

Time to feed the lions!
