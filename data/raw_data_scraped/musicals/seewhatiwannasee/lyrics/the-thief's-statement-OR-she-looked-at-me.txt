The Thief's Statement / She Looked At Me


The Thief: (spoken)

1951 will be remembered as the year Jimmy Mako terrorized New york City.



(sung)

So whatcha want me to say?

You got me.

Yeah,

I killed him.

So whatcha want me to do?

Why lie now?

Why bother?



I'll get the chair anyway.

That's how it goes.

Boo hoo.



Wasn't the first time I killed someone,

Won't be the last time for you,

'Cept you do it different, you do it legally.



Ain't such a big deal,

It's easy work.

Murder is what I do best.

Where I grew up,

It's something you learn

Like passin' your drivers test.



So whatcha waitin' to hear?

The details?

You got it.

Like all the screams and the fear?

I know you,

You like it.

Ain't america a helluva town?

Funky dunky things go down.

The truth then

And notin but...

Whatcha been itchin to hear,

Whatcha been dyin to know,

Whatcha want me to say...



(spoken)

I wasn't lookin' for it.

It was about ten p.m, Saturday.

I'm out on the steet,

Waitin for nothin (or somethin) to happen,

Hangin out by the movie house, Jap pic.

Then she comes out of the movies...



(sung)

walkin'.

Shiftin'.

Shakin'.

Oozin' by.

Never seen her before.

Tasty thing,

Two long legs

and a couple of granite eyes.

Plenty going on there and plenty wise.

Then she looked at me,

I was mindin my own business.

She looked at me

And i was taken by surprise.

I was scroungin around for a cigarette

When i smelled perfume and I'll never forget That glance she threw

Like a no win bet

That said baby wants to dance tonight

Plain as plain could be

Baby wants to rock and roll and do the do with me, with me, with me.

I was sober enough,

Enought to know,

When she looked at me

She was rarin' to go.



But what did she do?

She walked on by.

The property of one of those

Greased-down, pinstriped guys.

Oh, she's good at teasin'

And tellin' lies

But she looked at me;

Like she was mine and no one else's.

She looked at me

And I'm the devil in disguise.

I stole her soul

When she threw her glance;

I say she had no right to settin'

Fire to my pants-

My head was all a-buzzin'

Full of army ants screaming:

"Baby's gonna dance, all right."

Right across the tappan zee

Gonna make her cry and beg and do the do with me, with me, with me.

It was her own damn fault

For leadin me on;

When she looked at me

she was as good as

Gone.
