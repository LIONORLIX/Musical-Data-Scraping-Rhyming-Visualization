Rising Up/Finale Act 2


CPA: (sung)

The sky goes grey

Then turns into blackness

Erasing day.



Aunt Monica/CPA: (sung)

A wind begins

And builds to the howl

Of a million sins.



Aunt Monica/CPA/The Reporter: (sung)

A lightning flash

Then more, and the clouds

Writhe with every slash.



Aunt Monica/CPA/The Reporter/The Actress: (sung)

A mist appears

And hangs in the air

Like a spider's tears.



A violent shake

And a churning twister

Consumes the lake.



The rain pours hard

As the cyclone grows

And the leaves are ripped off

The cracking branches.

Screams and shouts

And the flight of masses

Spinning, manic

Bursting, glowing

Glowing, glowing-!



The Priest: (sung)

Everyone flees

Without looking backwards.

Everyone flees.



But I look back

At the swirling twister

I look back.

And I see

What nobody sees

And I see

Rising up

From the depths of the pond

Rising up:



Glory!

Glory!

Glory...



(spoken)

A miracle.

I saw.

Aunt Monie...

You believe me, don't you?



Aunt Monica: (spoken)

If you say so, baby. Why not?



The Priest: (sung)

Why not..?

I guess...

I think...

Why not...



(spoken)

A month later at Aunt Monica's funeral,

I put on the collar again...

but...I'm not celebrating Mass.

Not yet...

I'm...

Because...

I created a lie that became the truth.

The lie was for everyone.

But the truth was only for myself.

So what do I do with it Monsignor?

What do I do with the truth?



(sung)

I saw...

I felt...

Last year...

And now...

What now...



The Priest/Company: (sung)

The truth

The truth

The truth

The truth...
