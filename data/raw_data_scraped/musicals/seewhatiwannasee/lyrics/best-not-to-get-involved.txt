Best Not To Get Involved


The Janitor: (spoken)

I told ya, the guy was dead.

And I did exactly what you're supposed to do in situations like this:

I went home.



(sung)

One thing leads to another

Then another

And then another

One thing leads to another.

Best not to get involved.



In this town

Someguy's always got a brother

Who's a brother

Who's got a brother

Who'd easily shoot his own mother

Best not to get involved.



You never know

When you bump into a stiff

Whose stiff it is

And how it got there.

Mysteries all got an undertow.

And when you go

Snoopin' round the facts

The facts may turn out

To be stranger

Than the mystery you wasn't s'pose to know.

Don't stop.

Don't touch.

Don't ask.

Go home, go home, go home ---



In this town

One thing leads to another

Then another

And then another.

Livin' here you gotta smother

Your curiosity--

Wait untill the mystery's solved.

Best not to get, best not to get,

Best not to get involved.
