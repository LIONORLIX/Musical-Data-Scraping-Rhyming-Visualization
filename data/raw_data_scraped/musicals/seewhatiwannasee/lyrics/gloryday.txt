Gloryday


The Reporter: (spoken)

As you can see, Carol, there is a crowd gathered here at the pond.

By all accounts, it's a peaceful gathering, though police can be seen patrolling the area.

One can't call this a demonstration...



The Priest: (sung)

You've got your crazies

For Jesus' sake.

The losers who've got Nothing to lose.

You've got your herds

Of broken souls,

Emotionally drained black holes;

You've got 'em all here:

Waiting for the Gloryday.



You've got your crippled

And blind and deaf;

A selection of afflictions

To choose.



You've got your shreds

Of desperate lives;

Your criminals and battered wives

All gathering here:

Waiting for the Gloryday.



The Priest/Aunt Monica/The Reporter/CPA: (sung)

Gloryday

Glory-!



The Priest: (sung)

Move over Graceland

Bye, bye Lourdes.

The world has a new religious shrine.

The poor and the wealthy

Are coming in hordes.

Bring your sins

And form a line
