Coffee


The Actress: (sung)

I had just finished shooting

A coffee commercial

National spot

A residual heaven

My boyfriend's on T.V.

A soap opera villain

We both live in splendor

In Beverly Hills

The Hills, The Hills, The Hills...



Life could not have been sweeter

I love California.

We celebrate sweeps month;

Cocaine and vodka,

Drive through the mountains

Laughing and speeding

The stars are so dazzling

The road spins and weaves.



Our convertible Jaguar

Leaps off the mountain

Thank God I'm to stoned

To be wearing my seatbelt

I crash and I tumble

Through cactus and sage

Breaking my arm and my nose

And my jaw and my neck.



(spoken)

Ouch, right?



So I wake up in surgery

Ten hours later

My agent sends flowers

My boyfriend is missing

My face is disfigured

It's perfectly ruined

The Star takes my picture

I'm news for a week.



Then the agency cancels

My coffee commercial

It's farewell, goodbye

To residual heaven

Thank God for the morphine

Thank God for my dealer

And for the vodka

That mellows the coke.

The coke. The coke. The coke.

The coke. The coke. The coke.

Yeah.



I could use a little help.

I could use a little hope.

I could use a little something that has worth

And illuminates the point

Of my being on this earth.

Look, I look around the earth

And I see,

I don't need and agent.

I don't need a job.

I don't need the coke or booze,

I can kick'em if I choose.

But I could use

A little miracle.

Yeah.

I could use

A little miracle...



I had just finished shooting

A coffee commercial

And ain't it ironic?

I don't drink coffee.

Coffee. Coffee. Coffee.

Coffee. Coffee. Coffee.
