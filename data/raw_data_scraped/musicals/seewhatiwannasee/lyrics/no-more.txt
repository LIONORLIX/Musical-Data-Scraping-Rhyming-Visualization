The Wife: (spoken)

Do something for me.



The Theif: (spoken)

Anything.



The Wife: (spoken)

This man thinks I'm his property.



The Medium: (sung)

Look at her eyes-



The Husband: (sung)

Look at her eyes



The Theif: (sung)

Look at your eyes...



The Wife: (spoken)

But I am not your property.



The Theif: (sung)

Icy heat.



The Husband: (sung)

Icy heat.



The Medium: (sung)

Icy heat.



The Wife: (spoken)

I'll never have any peace as long as you're around.



The Husband: (sung)

A devil released.



The Theif: (sung)

A devil released.



The Husband/The Theif/The Medium: (sung)

A devil released...



The Wife: (sung)

No more trying not to laugh

As you struggle

To squeeze into your trousers

As you slowly go bald.



No more listening to Danny Kaye albums

Or leaping to your voice

Or jumping when called.



No more sleeping through

Your boring foreign movies.

What was it the last time?

Something Japanese.



No more sitting still

While you and your lawyers

Drone on and on

About taxi cab fees.



No more visiting you mother every Sunday.

Choking down her pasta.

Which she always over salts.



No more three A.M. jealous innuendos

Then begging my forgiveness

And then pointing out my faults.



No more.

No more.

Don't look at me that way.

Your ears and your eyes

Got used to the lies

But you're getting the truth today.



No more forcing me

To wear the crap you buy me.

Has anbody told you

You have rotten taste in clothes?



No more forcing me to do

And not to question.

Why I took it this long,

Christ only knows.



No more forcing me

To give up what I wanted.

Sure, I liked your money

But you never bought my soul.



No more forcing me

To put up with your patronizing

Hot-stick, King-Kong

Need to control.



No more forcing me

To act like enjoy it

When you suddenly remember

That I'm sharing your bed.



No more forcing me

To lie and say I'm sorry.

You wanna blame me, baby

Well then, you go right ahead.



No more.

No more.

Don't look at me that way.

You're not alive.

We're not alive.

You and I died today.

No, no more.

No more.

No more!

No more!
