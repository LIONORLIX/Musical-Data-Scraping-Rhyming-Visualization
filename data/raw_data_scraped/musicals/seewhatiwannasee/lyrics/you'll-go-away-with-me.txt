You'll Go Away With Me


The Theif: (sung)

You'll go away with me.

You know you will.

You'll go away with me

And not look back.



Does the sun really rise in the east?

Does the earth really spin around the sun?

What's it matter in the least?

What's real for me ain't real for everyone.



You wanna stay with me.

You know you do.

You know the truth

Is tearin' up your heart.



You knew what you needed.

You knew what you wanted to find.

You'll go away with me

And leave what was behind...
