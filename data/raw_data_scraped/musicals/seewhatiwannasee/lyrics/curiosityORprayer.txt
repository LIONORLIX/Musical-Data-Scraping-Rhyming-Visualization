Curiosity/Prayer


The Reporter: (sung)

Curiosity

Made me look out of the window

On a bright blue crisp blue day.

Curiosity

Made me stare into the fire

That was coming right my way.

Curiosity

Made me wonder what would happen

If I choose to watch and stay.

Let there be a blessing

For our grief.

And there is no sense of time.

This is what it's like to be God, I realize.

I only watch and I only listen.



The Actress/CPA/The Reporter: (sung)

Fallen angels, all of us,

With wings unfit to fly.

You can heal us, Father.

Make us fit to fly.

If not that,

At least give back

Our reason

To try...



The Priest: (sung)

The lie...

The lie becomes the truth.

The truth, the truth...
