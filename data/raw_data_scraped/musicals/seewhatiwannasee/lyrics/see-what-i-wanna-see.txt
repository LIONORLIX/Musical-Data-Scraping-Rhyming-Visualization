See What I Wanna See


The Wife: (sung)

Friday night down on Houston,

In a spot called Bamboo Jack's,

Everyone was doin' the mambo

And drinkin' Golden Cadillacs.



Sally was there with her Daddy.

But Daddy was in a funk

'Cause Sally met up with and took a shine

To a hunk from East Podunk.



And Daddy cried, "Hey, Whatcha doin' watcha doin'?

What's he got I don't got?

All I see's

American cheese.

He'll melt when you get hot."



And Sally said:

"I see what I wanna see.

I know what I wanna know.

I don't need you

To tell me what's true

If you don't like it, Daddy,

You can blow, blow, blow, blow, blow!"



Saturday night at the same place.

They roll up the bamboo rug.

Everyone was doin' the limbo,

Except Sally and her Podunk Plug.

Seems he took a shine to some chicken

Shakin' her tom-tom-tom.

Sally saw that and---guacamole---

She exploded like the hydrogen bomb.



She cried, "Hey, hey watcha doin' watcha doin'?

What's she got that I lack?

That chicken is thin

And meaner than sin

And uglier than Bamboo Jack!"



The Husband/The Band: (sung)

And he said!



The Wife: (sung)

"I see what I wanna see

I know what I wanna know.

I don't need you

To tell me what's true

If you don't like it, baby,

You can blow blow blow blow blow blow blow blow!



I see what I wanna see

I know what I wanna know

I don't need you

To tell me what's true -

If you don't like it baby baby baby baby ba-ba-baby you can blow!"
