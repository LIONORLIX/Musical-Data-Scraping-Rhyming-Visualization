The Medium and the Husband's Statement


The Janitor: (spoken)

I'm not a psychic so how do I know what she was thinking when she, when he...?

They say only the dead tell the truth, you know.



The Medium: (sung)

What would you like me to say?

It's my work

Talking with the dead.

Flat rate.

Twenty bucks.

So there I was: I'm holding a seance.

For a lawyer.

Who is desp'rate.

Wants to speak with a loved one:

His sister Alice Sue...

Alice Mae.



(spoken)

I was trying to contact said deceased relative when this other spirit breaks in, I almost whooped my pants.

I've heard about this happening to other mediums, psychic interruptions, but never to me.



(sung)

So this spirit, he's got a story

It's a doozy,

And he tells me

No one else knows his story.

Thought I should get involved.



(spoken)

He came from the other side.

This man.

The husband.

And so...

Restless....



The Medium/The Husband: (sung)

Dark...

It's dark here...

Space...

No stars...

No where...

I remember...

My life...

My death...
