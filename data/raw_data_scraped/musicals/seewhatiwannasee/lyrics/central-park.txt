Central Park


CPA: (sung)

I was a CPA.

Office.

Briefcase.

White shirt.

Striped tie.

Crunching numbers.

Hiding assets.

Trying to disguise

My clients' little lies.



I was a happy man.

Nice house.

Nice life.

Nice kids.

Nice wife.

And a girlfriend.

I was king of my domain.

Formulating capitol gain:

Ten thousand

Minus

Three thousand

Divide by

Six hundred

And that's another million!



My father was a Rabbi.

And I knew about God.

I knew that God watched me day and night.



But then one day at night,

I was working in my office,

I was crunching little numbers

I was hiding little lies

And suddenly I realize that

God doesn't see me.

He doesn't see my through the concrete

Or the bad fluorescent lighting,

No, God doesn't see me.

He doesn't see me in the numbers,

In my suits

Or in my life!

He doesn't see my life!



(spoken)

I tried to tell people but nobody would listen.

Do you know what that is like when nobody listens?



(sung)

You get angry.

At your asshole boss.

And your stupid wife

Because she can't perceive

The hell you're going through,

And then one day,

You wanna blow her face away.

You wanna blow the world away!



So I jumped in a cab

And I drove through Manhattan

And I reached Columbus Circle

And I stopped.

And I walked into the park...



Central Park.

Jungleland.

Hidden treasures

For CPA's.

And cheating husbands

And sons of rabbis...



(spoken)

And I saw the message.

And I knew what I had to do.



(sung)

Here I am in Central Park.

No more job or family.

No more lies.

Or suits or ties.

Made myself at home here.

Made myself at home.



And all week long

I have swapped cigarettes

For a spot on a bench,

Sleeping next to an actor Who snores.

(I love it.)



All week long

I have tanned in the rambles

And bathed in the pond;

I am perfumed

With the great outdoors!



Who invented Central Park?

I would like to thank him.

God will see

A purer me:

Gloryday unbind me.

Put my past behind me.

Shine and blaze and blind me!

Come and find me,

God!
