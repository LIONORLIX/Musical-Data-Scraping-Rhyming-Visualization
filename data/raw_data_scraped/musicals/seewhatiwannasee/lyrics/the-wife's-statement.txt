The Wife's Statement


The Wife: (sung)

What do you want me to say?

I killed him.

My husband.

Look at me.

What can I do?

Look at me...



(spoken)

After that monster...

After he...

I must have blacked-out.

When I woke up it was near morning.

And I saw Louie.

He was alive, but...



(sung)

He looked at me,

Silent as a statue.

He looked at me,

A look I've never seen before.

Cold And hot--

Glaring in the dark.

Freezing my insides--

Burning down the park--

I felt unclean. I felt--

Unclean.
