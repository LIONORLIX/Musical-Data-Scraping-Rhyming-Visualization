Kesa: (sung)

Tonight I kiss my lover for the last time,

He comes for me at midnight

Slipping past the gate

Floating to my bed.

I'll let his hands caress me for the last time,

He knifes into my body,

Forcibly and proud,

My love is incredibly endowed,

Thinker than my husband.



And as I kiss my lover for the last time,

The room dissolves around me,

I desert my body.

All of time is gone,

Dusk is dawn,

Dawn is noon,

Late is now,

Now is soon.

This is what it's like to be God.



I watch myself outside myself,

Sleep and breathe and wake and sigh,

Laugh and kiss and fuck and lie!

My God it's hell to be God.

Watching from a distance,

I neither laugh nor cry,

As the floodgates are opened and the innocent die

A lie becomes the truth

And the truth becomes a lie...

Lie...

Lie.



Tonight I kiss my lover for the last time

My husband knows our secret,

I've confessed my guilt

I'll end my lovers life

And I'll return to my body

To my four cornered room

what I've set in motion

cannot be reversed

Time

Will

Resume

Time...

Time...

Time!
