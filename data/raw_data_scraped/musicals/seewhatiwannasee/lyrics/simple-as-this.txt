Simple As This


The Husband: (sung)

Someone was crying

Someone in the dark.



(spoken)

Me...

Her stiletto...

I bought it for her

For protection.



(sung)

Lily, my treasure

Lily, my Judas...



Simple to do,

Leaving the world.

Simple as this.



The Husband/The Medium: (sung)

Simple as this.

Easier done

Than to concieve;

Don't have to think.

Nothing to grieve.



Life tries to hard

To imitate art.

Death doesn't have to.

It cuts to the heart

And answers with truth:



To live, you must lie.

Honour demands

The hero must die.

Simple as this.

Simple as this.

Simple as...



The Husband: (spoken)

I should have bought her a gun instead...

Would've been quicker.

Dying took a long time.

Later, I felt someone--



The Medium: (spoken)

I felt someone...



The Husband: (spoken)

Pull the stiletto out of me...



The Medium: (spoken)

Pull the stiletto out...



The Husband: (spoken)

Someone slipped it out...



The Medium: (spoken)

Someone...



The Husband: (spoken)

And all my blood flowed into the grass...



The Husband/The Medium: (sung)

Dark...

It's dark here...

Space...

No stars...

No where...



The Medium: (sung)

And that was all I received.

I'm just repeating his words.

I'm just a filter, okay?

I only told you the truth.
