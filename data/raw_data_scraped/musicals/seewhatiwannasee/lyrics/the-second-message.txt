The Second Message


The Priest: (sung)

How bold and blatant lie

Which genius has conceived.

The more far-fetched the lie,

The more that it's believed.



Tens by tens

They gather.

Suckers in the park.

Dozens by the dozens mass

As Gloryday looms

And the lie

Blooms!



The Priest/The Actress: (sung)

"In two weeks (In two weeks)

On Tuesday (On Tuesday)

At one P.M. sharp (At one P.M. sharp)

A miracle will occur (A miracle will occur)



Witness to the faith

You'll find salvation here;

From the depths of the pond

Christ will appear!

Believe!

And be free!"



The Actress: (sung)

"Believe and be free..."
