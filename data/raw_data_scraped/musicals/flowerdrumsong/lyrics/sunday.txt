Sunday


Now that we're going to be married,

I keep imagining things,

Things that can happen to people,

When they are wearing gold rings:



Being together each morning,

Sharing our coffee and toast.

That's only one of the pictures.

Here's what I picture most.



Sunday, sweet Sunday,

With nothing to do,

Lazy and lovely,

My one day with you.



Hazy and happy,

We'll drift through the day,

Dreaming the hours away.



While all the funny papers lie or fly around the place

I will try my kisses on your funny face.



Dozing, then waking,

On Sunday you'll see...

On...ly... me!



Sunday, sweet Sunday,

On Sunday you'll see...

On...ly... me!
