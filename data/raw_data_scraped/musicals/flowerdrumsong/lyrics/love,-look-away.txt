Love, Look Away


I have wished before,

I will wish no more.



Love, look away!

Love, look away from me.

Fly, when you pass my door,

Fly and get lost at sea.



Call it a day.

Love, let us say we're through.

No good are you for me,

No good am I for you.



Wanting you so,

I try too much.

After you go,

I cry too much.



Love, look away.

Lonely though I may be,

Leave me and set me free,

Look away, look away, look away... from... me.
