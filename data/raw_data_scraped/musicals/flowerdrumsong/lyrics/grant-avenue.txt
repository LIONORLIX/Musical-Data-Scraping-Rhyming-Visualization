Grant Avenue


A western street with eastern manners,

Tall pagodas and golden banners

Throw their shadows through the lantern glow.



You can shop for precious jade

or teakwood tables or silk brocade

Or see a bold and brassy night club show,

On the most exciting thoroughfare I know.



We call it

Grant Avenue, San Francisco,

California, U.S.A.

Looks down from Chinatown

Over a foggy bay.



You travel there in a trolley,

In a trolley up you climb,

Dong! Dong! You're in Hong Kong,

Having yourself a time.



You can eat, if you are in the mood,

Shark-fin soup, bean cake fish.

The girl who serves you all your food

Is another tasty dish!



You know you

Can't have a new way of living

Till you're living all the way

On Grant Avenue. --Where is that?--

San Francisco, That's where's that!

California U.S.A.
