Fan Tan Fannie


Fan Tan Fanny was leaving her man,

Fan Tan Fanny kept waving her fan,

Said "Goodbye, Danny, you two-timing Dan,

Some other man loves your little Fanny, Bye Bye!"



In the ice box, you'll find in a can

Some leftovers of Moo Goo Gai Pan.

Fan Tan Fanny has found a new guy.

His name is Manny, He's good for Fanny,

So goodbye Danny, Goodbye!

Bye bye! Bye bye! Bye bye!
