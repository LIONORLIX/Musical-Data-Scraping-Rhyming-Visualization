The Other Generation


What are we going to do about

The Other Generation?

How will ever communicate

Without communication?



You can't account for what they'll say or do.

And what peculiar thoughts they think

They never reveal to you.



A very discouraging problem is

The Other Generation.

They want to lead a life that's all their own.

Perhaps we ought to let them,

Forsake them and forget them!

But then we'd only find ourselves alone.--With one another!--

I don't believe we'd like to be alone!



What are we going to do about

The Other Generation?

They never take the blame for one mistake.--Oh no!--

Their parents are responsible

For ev'ry mistake they make!



A very discouraging problem is

The Other Generation.

And soon there'll be another one as well!

And when our out of hand sons

Are bringing up our grandsons,

I hope our grandsons give their fathers hell!--Can't wait to see it!--

I hope our grandsons give their fathers hell!
