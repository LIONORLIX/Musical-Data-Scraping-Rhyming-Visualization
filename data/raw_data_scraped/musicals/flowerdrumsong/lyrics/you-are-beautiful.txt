You Are Beautiful


Along the Hwang Ho Valley where young men walk and dream,

A flower boat with singing girls came drifting down the stream.

I saw the face of only one come drifting down the stream.



You are beautiful, small and shy.

You are the girl whose eyes met mine

Just as your boat sailed by.



This I know of you, nothing more,

You are the girl whose eyes met mine

Passing the river shore.



You are the girl whose laugh I heard,

Silver and soft and bright;

Soft as the fall of lotus leaves

Brushing the air of night.



While your flower boat sailed away,

Gently your eyes looked back on mine,

Clearly you heard me say,

"You are the girl I will love some day."
