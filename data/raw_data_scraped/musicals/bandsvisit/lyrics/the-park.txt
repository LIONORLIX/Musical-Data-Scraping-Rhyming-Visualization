The Park


[DINA, spoken]

This is the park. It's not look like a park, you have to imagine. You see, this, this is the grass. And there is where the children play. And this, this is the sea. Do you hear the sea?



[TEWFIQ, spoken]

Yes.



[DINA, spoken]

Tell me, Tewfiq, how does it feel to do music? To have the orchestra? How does it feel to have all the people waiting for you, and all their eyes for you? You know?



[TEWFIQ, spoken]

Well, it's...um...it...



[DINA, spoken]

Yes, what?
