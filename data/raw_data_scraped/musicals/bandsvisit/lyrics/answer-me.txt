Answer Me


[TELEPHONE GUY]

Here I am

Here I am

And the light is dying



Where are you?

Where are you?

Will you answer me?



All alone

In the quiet

Ah, my ears are thirsty



For your voice

For your voice

Can you answer me?



If I try, maybe I can see your shadow

In the sodium light that masquerades as moon

If I try, I might take off like a sparrow

And I'll travel along a guiding breeze



Very soon

Very soon

That's the sound of longing



Are you there?

Are you there?

Will you answer me?

Only you

What's left is only you
