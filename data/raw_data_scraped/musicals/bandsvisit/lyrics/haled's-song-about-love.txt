Haled's Song About Love


[HALED]

Not break the ice

You melt the ice

You melt yourself

And soon you're all one puddle



You talk, she talks

It's not about the conversation

The words are like your lips, are reaching out

To kiss the ear



You're here, she's here

Two drops of water

The pull, the pull

Invisible, but really real



Your eyes, her eyes

And soon, you're looking in a mirror

You realize you can't get nearer

You are both right there



You glow, she glows

Two suns, no shadow

Your skin, her skin

And everything's alight



No edge, no edge

No walls, no border

Two streams of water

That become the sea



[HALED]

The dance



The dance

[PAPI]



The dance



The dance

[HALED]

You see the wind that moves the trees is

The algebra that moves your knees

Is written in her eyes



[HALED]

Her eyes



Your eyes

[PAPI]



Her eyes



Your eyes

[BOTH]

You're only looking in a mirror



[HALED]

You realize you can't get nearer

And there's nowhere you don't meet
