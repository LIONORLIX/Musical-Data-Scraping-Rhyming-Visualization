Something Different (Reprise)


[DINA]

Is it a hymn?

Is it a love song?

The music is so beautiful

It melts away so quickly

And you're standing in the silence

Standing in the darkness

Singing about wishes



Every day, you stare to the west, to the south

You can see for miles, but it all stays the same

Then honey in your ears, spice in your mouth...
