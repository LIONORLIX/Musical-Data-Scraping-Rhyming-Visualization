Beat Of Your Heart


[AVRUM]

She was in a white dress

With red and purple ribbons in her hair

She was dancing with somebody

But in love and music, all is fair

We were finishing "The Girl from Ipanema"

Going into "Summertime"

I was in the middle of my solo

When her eyes met mine



Love starts on a downbeat

Love starts when the music starts

Love starts when the tune is sweet

And you lift your feet

To the beat of your heart



Love makes a rhythm

Love dances in a dancer's shoes

It moves when you start to move

And what is the groove?

The beat of your heart!



And we played "Moon River"

And "I Want to Hold Your Hand"

And the girl in the white dress

And the ribbons in her hair

Danced to my band

And I could feel my heart

It started jumping in my chest

And I smiled at her

And she smiled at me

And the music did the rest



Love sparks on the upbeat

Igniting with a minor 9th

Resolving to a major 6th

Then something clicks

And everything starts



There goes the kick drum

Spelling out the rhythm of love

Telling you get off your seat

And move your feet

And dance to the beat of your heart



And if you play me "Summertime"

And if I stop and close my eyes

I'll see an angel swirling, moving

Young and so alive



This music is a time machine

This music is a gift from God

Her face was beautiful

My God, her face was beautiful



So maybe I'm romantic

Maybe I'm a sentimental fool

Maybe music is the food of love

But music and love, who can tell them apart?



Just let me hear the downbeat



[ITZIK and CAMAL]

Let me hear the downbeat



[AVRUM]

And let me hear the bah, bah, bah!



[ITZIK and CAMAL]

Bah, bah, bah!



[AVRUM]

Let me hear it kick for kick and

Whack the snare



[AVRUM, ITZIK, and CAMAL]

And shake your ass

And stir up the air



[AVRUM]

And dance with the girl with the ribbons in her hair



[AVRUM, ITZIK, and CAMAL]

Embracing the rhythm of love

That's exactly the same as

The beat of your heart



[CAMAL]

The beat of your heart...



[ITZIK]

The beat of your heart...



[ITZIK and CAMAL]

The beat of your heart!
