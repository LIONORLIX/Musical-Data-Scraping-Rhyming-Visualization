Something Different


[DINA]

Is this a hymn?

Is this a love song?

Something ancient by a poet

Maybe Hafiz, maybe Rumi?



Is he singing about two hearts searching in the darkness?

Or is he singing about fishing?



The tune seems sad, but are the words sad?

What's he saying?

Is he praying?

And why do the words get to me?



Is he lonely? Maybe reaching out for someone?

Look at me. Maybe I'm the one who's fishing



Every day you stare to the west, to the south

You can see for miles, but things never change

Then honey in your ears, spice in your mouth

Nothing's as surprising as the taste of something strange



And here's this man

Right here beside me

Kind of deep and kind of cute

In his Sergeant Pepper suit



Is this my sheikh?

Is this my Omar Sharif?



Well, I know it's something different



[TEWFIQ]

Itgara'a...



[They sing together]



[DINA]

Who is this man right here beside me?

Closer by an inch or two, my cheek would touch his ear

What is he thinking? What does he wish for?

Is he singing about wishing?



Something new I've never seen before

Through these walls I build, these gates I protect

Something new I didn't notice I was hoping for

Nothing is as beautiful as something that you don't expect



Look at those hands

Those are not young hands

But they move like they are swimming through the music

Through the music

And I don't know what I feel

And I don't know what I know

All I know is I feel something different



[TEWFIQ]

Itgara'a...



[DINA]

He makes me feel something different
