He's a Ladies' Man


Corda:

There he goes, the modern knight



Flo:

The boy's despair, the girl's delight



Millie:

The women's home companion is his name



Lucy:

He's a clown, he's a wit

The co-eds say that he's got it



Corda, Flo, Millie, Lucy:

And what he does to flappers is a shame



Ensemble:

A dirty shame



Flo, Millie:

Walks collegiate, collegiate clothes

He's a ladies man



Lucy, Corda:

Gets that swagger gets that pose

He's a ladies man



Flo, Millie:

As a lover the boy's a star

When he gets 'em inside his car



Lucy, Corda:

He goes over the course in par

He's a ladies man



Ensemble:

In a pinch, in a clinch

Better leave yourself lots of headroom

Put on the breaks

When he mistakes

A rumble seat for a bedroom



Walks collegiate, collegiate clothes

He's a ladies man

Gets that swagger and gets that pose

He's a ladies man

Got a lot of energy and lots of class

He would be a catch for any lucky lass

But 'till he pops the question better block that pass

With a kick

Or a boot

Or a laugh or a hoot even though he is cute



He's a man!

He's man's man

What a man, what a man, what a man!
