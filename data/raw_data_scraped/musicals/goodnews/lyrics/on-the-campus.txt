On the Campus


Ensemble:

On the campus

Couples gather nightly on the campus

When the moon shines brightly you can see us

There

Pair by

Pair

We are out for more than just a

Breath of air

On the campus

If a sneaky prof should ever lamp us

We'd be through

Its daring

Pairing up for a lark

On the campus

After dark

*aw*
