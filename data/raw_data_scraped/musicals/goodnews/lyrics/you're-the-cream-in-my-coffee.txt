You're the Cream in My Coffee


I'm not a poet,

How well i know it,

I've never been a raver,

But when i speak of you,

I rave a bit, its true.



I'm wild about you,

I'm lost without you,

You give my life its flavor,

What sugar does for tea,

Thats what you do for me.



You're the cream in my coffee,

You're the salt in my stew

You will always be my necessity,

I'd be lost without you.



You're the starch in my collar,

You're the lace in my shoe

You will always be my necessity,

I'd be lost without you.



Most girls tell love tales,

And each phrase dovetails

You've heard each known way,

This way is my own way:



You're the sail of my loveboat,

You're the captain and crew,

You will always be my necessity

I'd be lost without you.



You're the cream in my coffee,

You're the salt in my stew

You will always be my necessity,

I'd be lost without you.



You will always be my necessity,

I'd be lost without you.



You will always be my necessity,

I'd be lost without you.



You are my life savor,

You bring out that certain flavor,

So dear, this is clear, dear,

You're my worcestershire, dear!



You're the sail in my loveboat,

You're the captain and crew,

You will always be my necessity,

I'd be lost without you.



You will always be my necessity

I'd be lost without you.

You

Sweet, Adorable You
