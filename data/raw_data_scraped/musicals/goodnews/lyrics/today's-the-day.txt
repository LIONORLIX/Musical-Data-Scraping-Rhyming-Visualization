Today's the Day


Pi Beta Phi Girls:

Today's the day!

Today's the day of the game!

How the minutes will tick off

'till the time of the kick off!

We'll play the way

We played our way into fame!

A punt, a fall

We'll follow the ball

And, oh, the chill and thrill of it all

We'd give an eye to beat them by a touchdown

We tried to bet and couldn't get so much down

For red!

And gray!

And siss boom bah and hooray!

Today's the day of the game!

Today's the day!



We'd give an eye to beat them by a touchdown

We tried to bet and couldn't get so much down

For red!

And gray!

And siss, boom, bah, and hooray!

Today's the day of the game!

Today's the day!
