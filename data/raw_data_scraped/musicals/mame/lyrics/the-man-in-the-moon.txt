The Man In The Moon


Mame:

Oh, Vera, I can't wait to hear that Overture,

Tell me about the show!

Vera:

Well, well, it's this terribly modern operetta about a lady astronomer,

who make a universe shaking discovery.

Chorus:

Oooooh Aaaaaaaaah...

vERA:

I have a little secret I'd like to impart.

That I hope doesn't give you too much of a start;

Tho' it's shocking, it's completely true.

I know it isn't gossip, or rumor, of course,

For I've had it from quite a reliable source

And I'd like to pass it on to you.



The man in the moon is a lady,

A lady in lipstick and curls;

The cow that jumped ovah cried,

"Jumpin' Jehovah,

I think it's just one of the girls."

She winks at the stars from her bed of green cheese,

That isn't a night-gown,

It's a Saturn chemise.

Oh, her friends are the stars and the planets,

She sends the Big Dipper a kiss;

So don't ever offend her,

Remember her gender,

The man in the moon is a miss.
