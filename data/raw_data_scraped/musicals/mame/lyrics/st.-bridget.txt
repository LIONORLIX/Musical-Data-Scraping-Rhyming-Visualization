St. Bridget


Agnes Gooch:

Saint Bridget, deliver us to Beekman Place,

Away from the wicked and depraved;

A gray head is peeping through the curtain lace,

Calling "Come ye inside, where you'll be saved."

She's baked him a cherry pie and glazed a ham,

Her dear arms reach out for his embrace;

So if you have pity on this poor lost lamb,

God love you, dear Saint Bridget, deliver us to

Bee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-eekman Place

[speaking]

Sing with me Patrick, it will keep up your courage!

Agnes and Young Patrick:

So if you have pity on this poor lost sheep,

God love you, dear Saint Bridget, deliver us to

Bee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-eekman Place
