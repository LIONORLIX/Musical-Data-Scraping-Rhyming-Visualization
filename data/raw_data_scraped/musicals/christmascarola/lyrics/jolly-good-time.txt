Jolly Good Time


What a good time! What a fine show!

Jolly good evening, Gentlemen!

Isn't it nice that once again it's Christmas Eve!

Fills a fellow with delight! Everyone sing Fa-la-la-la!

Rup a bup bum! Hip hip hoo-rah!

Knowing we'll have a jolly good time tonight!

What a good time! What a fine day!

Getting a gift for evryone.

Giving out gifts is so much fun on Christmas Eve!

Fills a fellow with delight!

Everyone sing Fa la la la! Rup a bup bum!

Hip hip hoo-rah! Knowing we'll have a jolly good time tonight!

Thank the Lord our business has been keen!

Thank the Lord and bless and keep the Queen! Her Majesty the Queen!

What a good time! What a fine day!

Giving the poor a coin or two!

Charity's what we wealthy do on Christmas Eve!

Fills a fellow with delight! Knowing we'll have a jolly good time tonight!
