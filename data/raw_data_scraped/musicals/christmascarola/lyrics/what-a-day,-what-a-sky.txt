What A Day, What A Sky


SCROOGE

What a day, what a sky

What a happy man am I!

What a joy to be live and well!

God, what a street!

What friends you meet!



(Old Joe and his smelly horse go by.)



What a sound!

What a lovely smell!



(Scrooge sees the Charity Men.)



Here are coins

For the poor,

Just the first of many more,

And a check for your charity!

And if we save a few

Let it all have to do with me!



(Scrooge sees poor Mr. Smythe and his daughter.)



?Smythe!?

Hear the bells as they chime.

Mr. Smythe, you?re out of time!

And you?re now out of debt as well!

Go buy the tots

A toy, buy lots!

Have a good and a fine noel!

If I?d known what I know

I?d have done it years ago!

I?m as light as a man can be!

Oh, the whole world is new

And it all has to do with me!



(Scrooge makes his way through the streets, seeing familiar faces.)



SANDWICHBOARD MAN

Mr. Scrooge was laughin?!

Gave me quite a fright!



LAMPLIGHTER

Something made him see the light!



BLIND OLD HAG

Maybe he?s been drinkin?!

Gave me quite a start!



ALL THREE

Maybe Christmas touched his heart!



(Scrooge stops off at the Cratchits to deliver his prize turkey to

them and pledges to help them from now on.

He continues on to his nephew?s door, and humbly asks if he can come to Christmas dinner.)



FRED

There?s a place in my heart

Where you?ve always been for me.



SCROOGE

?Sally??



(He presents her with the bunch of flowers he purchased.)



SALLY

?We?re so very happy you?ve come.?



FRED, SALLY

Welcome home, Uncle Scrooge

Welcome home to family.



(A few snowflakes fall?and then, many, many more.)
