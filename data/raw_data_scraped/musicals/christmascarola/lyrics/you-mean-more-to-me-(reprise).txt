You Mean More To Me (Reprise)


CRATCHIT

I don’t have a fortune

Hidden in a shoe.

Many men have fortunes.

All I have is you …

“We shall none of us forget you, Tiny Tim. My little child.



(The Ghost leads Scrooge to another spot in the graveyard where a neglected gravestone stands alone. Scrooge sees his own

name on it.)
