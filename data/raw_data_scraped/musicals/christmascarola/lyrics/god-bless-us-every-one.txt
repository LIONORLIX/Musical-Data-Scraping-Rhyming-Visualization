God Bless Us Every One


Let the stars in the sky

Remind us of man’s compassion.

Let us love till we die

And God bless us everyone.



In your heart there’s a light

As bright as a star in Heaven.

Let it shine through the night

And God bless us everyone.

“My poor darlings. Thrust into the world so young. Ebenezer, Fan, I will send for you as soon as possible. Till then, work

hard. Write often. Above all, do not let your hearts grow bitter.”



Star by star in the sky

And kindness by human kindness.

Let us love ‘til we die

And God bless us everyone.

God bless us everyone.
