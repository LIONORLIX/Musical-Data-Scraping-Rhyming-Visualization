GHOST OF CHRISTMAS PAST

"Ah, Emily. The light of your life."



MRS. FEZZIWIG

Merry Christmas to all!



GHOST OF CHRISTMAS PAST

What a lovely night

Happiness and light

Emily was all you'd ever need.

But remember the way your life would lead.



SCROOGE

"My partnership with Jacob Marley."



YOUNG SCROOGE

What a good plan



YOUNG MARLEY

What an endeavor.



YOUNG SCROOGE AND YOUNG MARLEY

We'll have a business you and I.



YOUNG SCROOGE

Money will flow



YOUNG MARLEY

Money forever



YOUNG SCROOGE AND YOUNG MARLEY

Money in bundles ten feet high.



YOUNG SCROOGE

Never be poor

Living on credit.



YOUNG MARLEY

Let it be known what we are for.



YOUNG SCROOGE AND YOUNG MARLEY

Profit, yes!

And nothing less

When we put Scrooge and Marley on the door!



GHOST OF CHRISTMAS PAST

"Link by link,

Year by year,

Creditor after creditor,

Your partnership flourished

And your fortune grew!"



PERSON

I'd like to borrow ten, sir.

I'll pay you back again, sir."



GROUP 1

Here's half that I did borrow.

I'll bring the rest tomorrow.



GROUP 2

I need a bit of time, sir.

You know my credit's prime, sir.



MR. FEZZIWIG

I've fallen deep in debt, sir.

I swear I'll pay you yet, sir.

I helped you both get started.

What's made you so hardhearted?



GHOST OF CHRISTMAS PAST

Do not turn away.

Here's the price you pay.

Here's another shadow yet to see.

Come remember...



EMILY

You love

Nothing quite so much as gold,

Well I have some gold to bring

From days

Long before our dreams grew cold

I give you your ring



SCROOGE

"Emily, no..."



EMILY

Bless you, Ebenezer.



(Musical interlude.

Marley dies.)



SCROOGE

"Ah, yes. I remember.



(Musical interlude)



PEOPLE FROM SCROOGE'S PAST

Voices from the past

Calling you at last

Voices of the ones who loved you so

Come remember

The lights of long ago



SCROOGE

"No! No more!"

GHOST OF CHRISTMAS PAST

"These are the shadows of the things that have been. They are what they are. Do not blame me.

They are what they are. Do not blame me......"
