Christmas Together


TINY TIM:

O what a day, I don?t care if it?s grey

If it?s Christmas together.

People will say we?re the luckiest family in town.

Mother is making a perfect feast

And wearing her loveliest gown,

And father will come and he?ll carry me down

To Christmas together.



MR. CRATCHIT:

Here?s to the lad who makes everyone glad

That it?s Christmas together.



MRS. CRATCHIT:

Here?s to the one day we don?t give our worries a thought

Chicken!

And look what surprises your father has bought,

For Christmas together!

Let the stars in the sky remind us of man?s compassion.

Let us love ?till we die and god bless us everyone.



SCROOGE NEPHEW:

A toast to my wicked old uncle Scrooge!



DIALOUGE



SCROOGE NEPHEW:

Here?s to his health although he puts wealth

Over Christmas together.

Sad when a fellow has nothing to love but his gold.

Year after year you invite him here,



GUEST TWO:

I hope that his dinner gets cold!



SCROOGE NEPHEW:

Well, here?s to the year when old Scrooge will come home

For Christmas together!



ALL:

Gather and sing ?bout this glorious thing

Known as Christmas together!

Families created by friendship as well as by warmth!

Even the poor are so rich in love!

And laughter is never in dearth!

So celebrate Christmas for all it is worth!

To friendship!

To family!

To Paris!

To Hong Kong!

To everyone

All over the Earth!
