-GHOST OF JACOB MARLEY-

It is required of every man,

that his spirit travel far.

Lending help to those he can,

no matter who they are.

But if you don't go forth in life,

spreading joy and easing pain,

your spirit will go forth in death,

and you shall wear a chain!



These were coins I hoarded for a rainy day,

now with every jingle I'm distressed!

Locks and keys that helped me keep the poor away...

That's what put these locks and keys around my waist..



Link by link,

my chain was getting longer!

Link by link,

I should've heard a clink!

Link by link,

each year a little stronger..

Link by link by HORRIFYING link!



Stacking up my silver and my bits of gold,

filling up my vault when day was done!

Well, vaults are made of lead

and cash is very cold!

And around your neck they weigh a bloody ton!



Link by link,

You're on the brink.

It's written here,

in blood-red ink.

Unlock your heart!

It's not too late!

For you'll be dragging something more than

twice this weight!



-SCROOGE-

No, please...



-GHOST OF JACOB MARLEY-

Ebenezer Scrooge...



-SCROOGE-

Y-yes?



-GHOST OF JACOB MARLEY-

You shall be visited by three ghosts!



-SCROOGE-

Umm, no thank you..



-GHOST OF JACOB MARLEY-

When the clock strikes one -

the Ghost of Christmas Past..



-SCROOGE-

I prefer not to think about the past..



-GHOST OF JACOB MARLEY-

When the clock strikes two -

the Ghost of Christmas Present..



-SCROOGE-

At present, I'd rather go to bed. Good night...



-GHOST OF JACOB MARLEY-

When the clock strikes three -

the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Be!



Three ghosts who yet may stop you

from ending up like me...



~ Ghosts of other greedy men and women invade Scrooge's room. ~



-GHOST CHORUS-

Singing sorry spirits who were once like you!*

Dragging chains are all that we've acquired.



All the good in life it's now too late to do..

not to mention this could really make you tired!



Link by link,

your chain is in the making!

Link by link,

no way to make it shrink!

Link by link,

just listen to it shaking!



Whoo ooooo oooooo ooooo

oooooo oooo ooooooo oo

oooo oooo whooo ooo ooooo
