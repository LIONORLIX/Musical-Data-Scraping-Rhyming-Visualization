Nothing To Do With Me


Nothing To Do With Me Part 1



CRATCHIT

Mr. Scrooge, I’m sorry,

But sir, might I go?

Might you pay me early,

Just this once…



SCROOGE

(Shouting after the Charity Men)

“Picking a man’s pocket every 25th of December!”



CRATCHIT

(Determinedly)

My Tiny Tim is ill, sir.

Youngest son, you know!

Wife and children need me,

Just this one…



SCROOGE

People wanting this,

People wanting that,

Spreading bloody cheer!



CRATCHIT

“It’s only once a year, sir!”



SCROOGE

Plucking at your sleeve,

Holding out the hat,

Singing in your ear!



CRATCHIT

“Oh, I’m sorry, sir, I never meant to…”



SCROOGE

Taking off a day,

Asking for their pay,



CRATCHIT

“Only once a year!”



SCROOGE

Only once a year!

Well you can take Christmas

And stuff it with bread!

And if that isn’t perfectly clear…

I do not need to know

Of your family or your woe.

I suggest Tiny Tim drink yea!



CRATCHIT

“He’s only six!”



SCROOGE

Give him tea, give him stew

It has nothing to do

With me!



FRED

Come to Christmas dinner.

We’re inviting you,

Be with family, Uncle,

Just this once.



SCROOGE

“No, thank you.”



FRED

You’d enjoy it, Uncle.

We’d enjoy it, too.

You’d meet Sally, Uncle,

Just this once.



SCROOGE

People taking wives,

Living little lives,

Cozier than mice!



FRED

“We want nothing from you.”



SCROOGE

Marrying for love,

Push will come to shove,

You’ll be thinking twice.



FRED

“I will not get angry, Uncle!”



SCROOGE

Asking me to dine,

Breaking open wine,

Taking no advice!



FRED

(Getting annoyed despite himself)

“Good God!”



SCROOGE

Well, you can have Christmas,

And marriage as well,

And to hell with your trees and your rice!

I will not fill my plate,

Socialize, or celebrate

With a fool and his family.



FRED

(Amused at his uncle’s outrageousness)

“Well!”



SCROOGE

Let your love see you through

But have nothing to do

With me!



Nothing To Do With Me Part 2



JONATHON

Hear the bells over London town,

How joyously they ring.

See the lamps aglow in…



SCROOGE

“For God’s sake, child! Shut up and let me pass!”

(Jonathon kicks him in the shin.

Scrooge raises his stick to strike him but Jonathon dodges and runs.

The Sandwichboard Man blocks Scrooge.)



SANDWICHBOARD MAN

Hey! Have you forgotten how to smile, sir?



SCROOGE

“Smile? At what? Children should earn their wages by more than a song.”



SANDWICHBOARD MAN

Come and buy a ticket to the show?



SCROOGE

“Only fools waste their time and money on frivolity. Now move aside.”



SANDWICHBOARD MAN

Life’ll pass you by

In just a while, sir,

And it may be later than you know!



(A Woman Lamplighter tumbles on the ground, her makeshift ladder broken.)



LAMPLIGHTER

Help a workin’ person

Reach the light, sir?



SCROOGE

“A woman’s not fit for the job.”



LAMPLIGHTER

My husband’s ill,

He’ll likely get the sack!



SCROOGE

“Then it’s the workhouse for you both, isn’t it!”



LAMPLIGHTER

Oughta take the time

For doin’ right, sir!



SCROOGE

“Good evening.”



LAMPLIGHTER

(Menacingly)

You’ll be sorry, sir,

When you look back!



(Scrooge hears the loud tap-tapping of the Bind Old Hag’s cane.)



BLIND OLD HAG

Spare a coin

For someone who is blind, sir?



SCROOGE

“Devil take you, old woman. I have nothing for you.”



BLIND OLD HAG

(Grabbing his arm hard)

None so blind

As those who will not see!



SCROOGE

“Release my arm. Let go of me!”



BLIND OLD HAG

Go your sorry way,

And never mind, sir!

Come the future,

You’ll remember me!



(Scrooge reels away from her, and stops in his tracks, as a small funeral procession passes.

Following behind are Mr. Smythe and Grace Smythe.)



GRACE SMYTHE

Let the stars in the sky

Remind us of man’s compassion.

Let us love till we die

And God bless us everyone.



(Grace and the funeral procession dissolve into the distance leaving Scrooge all alone.)



SCROOGE

Damn this silly season!

Damn all humankind!

Makes you lose your reason!

Makes you lose your mind!

Next thing you know

I’ll be dancing in snow.

Throwing coins to the poor,

And the lame, and the blind!

Well, I wish that the whole world

Would just let me be!

Let the whole world be damned!

It has nothing to do with me!



(Suddenly the Blind Old Hag is at his elbow again.)



BLIND OLD HAG

(whispers menacingly)

“Look to yourself! You look to yourself, before it’s too late.”



SCROOGE

“Bah, Humbug!”
