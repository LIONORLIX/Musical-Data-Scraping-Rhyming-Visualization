Lights Of Long Ago


It?s your lucky night

Brought you something bright

Something with a twinkle and a glow

To remember

The lights of long ago



Remember the lights of long ago

Limbers in the dark

Here and there a spark

Suddenly a pictures starts to glow

Come remember the lights of long ago

Remember the lights of long ago



A child

Is this who you used to be

A scene shining from your past

The first Christmas of your memory

The shadows you cast

Remember and see the light at last

Remember

Mr. Scrooge

Of long ago

Downward to through the night

Onward to the light

On ward to the things your heart will know

Come remember the lights of long ago

Remember

The lights of long ago

Remember

Remember?

Remember

Remember the lights of long ago
