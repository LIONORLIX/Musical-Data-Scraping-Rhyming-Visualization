You Mean More To Me


Bob Cratchit: I don't need a fortune,

Hidden in a shoe,

Many men have fortunes,

But they don't have you.

When I look at you, I'm richer than a king,

Yes, you mean more to me than anything.



[Spoken] Up you go, son!

Mrs Cratchit: Goodbye, my loves.



Bob Cratchit: We shall buy some apples.



Tiny Tim: Mum will love them so!

Father, look, the theatre!



Bob Cratchit: When we're rich, we'll go.



Both: All the joys of Christmas,

Bundled up with string.



Tiny Tim: But you mean more to me...

Bob Cratchit: You mean more...



Both: Yes, you mean more to me than anything.



[Spoken]

Turkey Seller: Here's a fine bird; my prize turkey.

Bob Cratchit: How much is it?

Turkey Seller: I'll take a sovereign.

Bob Cratchit: That's a little bit out of our price range.



Tiny Tim: I don't need a feast, Dad,

All I'd get is fat.

I don't need a turkey,

How'd I eat all that?

I shall be content no matter what you bring.

You mean more to me,



Bob Cratchit: You mean more to me,



Both: You mean more to me than anything.
