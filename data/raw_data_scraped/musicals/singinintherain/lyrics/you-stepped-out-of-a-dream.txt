You Stepped Out of a Dream


You stepped out of a dream

You are too wonderful to be what you seem!

Could there be eyes like yours,

Could there be lips like yours

Could there be smiles like yours,

Honest and truly?

You stepped out of a cloud

I want to take you away, away from the crowd

And have you all to myself,

Alone and apart out of a dream,

Safe in my heart



You stepped out of a dream

You are too wonderful to be what you seem!

Could there be eyes like yours,

Could there be lips like yours

Could there be smiles like yours,

Honest and truly?

You stepped out of a cloud

I want to take you away, away from the crowd

And have you all to myself,

Alone and apart out of a dream,

Safe in my heart
