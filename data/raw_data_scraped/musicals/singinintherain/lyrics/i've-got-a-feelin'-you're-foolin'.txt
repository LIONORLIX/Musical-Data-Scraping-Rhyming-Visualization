I've Got a Feelin' You're Foolin'


I've got a feelin' you're foolin'

I've got a feelin' you're havin' fun

I'll get a go by when you are done

Foolin' with me.

I've got a feelin' you're foolin'

I've got a notion it's make believe

I think you're laughin' right up your sleeve

Foolin' with me.

Life is worth living while you are giving

Moments of paradise.

You're such a stand out, but how you hand out

The hocus pocus from your eyes.

I've got a feelin' you're foolin'

I've got a feelin' it's all a frame

It's just the well known old army game

Foolin' with You.



(I've got a feelin' you're foolin'

I've got a feelin' you're havin' fun)



I'll get a go by when you are done

Foolin' with me.



I've got a feelin' you're foolin'

I've got a notion it's make believe



I think you're laughin' right up your sleeve

Foolin' with me.

Life is worth living while you are giving

Moments of paradise.

You're such a stand out, but how you hand out

The hocus pocus from your eyes.

I've got a feelin' you're foolin'

I've got a feelin' it's all a frame

It's just the well known old army game

Foolin' with You.



I've got a feelin',

A feelin' you're foolin'

Foolin'
