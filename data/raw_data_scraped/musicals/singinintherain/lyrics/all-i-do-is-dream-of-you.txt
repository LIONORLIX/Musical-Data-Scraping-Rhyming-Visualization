All I Do Is Dream of You


Kathy and Girls:

All I do is dream of you

The whole night through

With the dawn, I still go on

And dream of you

You're every thought

You're everything

You're every song I ever sing

Summer, winter, autumn and spring.



And were there more

Than twenty-four hours a day,

They'd be spent in sweet content

Dreamin' away



When skies are gray

When skies are blue

Morning, noon and nighttime too

All I do the whole day through

Is dream of you

All I do the whole day throughIs dream of you.



It's cat's meow!



All I do the whole day through

Is dream of you!
