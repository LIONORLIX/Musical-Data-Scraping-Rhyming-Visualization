What's Wrong with Me?


What's wrong with me?

Why doesn't he kiss me?

He has the chance

For a romance

What's wrong with me?



Whoat's wrong with me?

how come I don't thrill him?

He doesn't feel

My sex appeal

What's wrong with me?



Maybe I'm much too exciting

At dinner he don't even flirt

I know I'm truely inviting

So why don't he stay for dessert?



He asked me out in the moonlight

To linger and to roam

I thought he'd take me in his arms

But he just tooke me home



What's wrong with him?

He's lost his Libido

I got the urge

So why don't he splurge

What's wrong with him?



What's wrong with him?

We should be out dancing

I'm hot to trot

He'd rather not

What's wrong with him?



There's things more important than diction

So a girl can't say CAHN'T

I said it!

Why is he causing such friction

When he could be Mr. Lamont?!



What's wrong with me?

Why all this confusion

I'm quite a girl

A real cultured pearl

What's wrong with me?



I ain't so dumb!

This peach ain't a plum!

What' wrong with him?

Tell me what's wrong with me?!

NOTHIN'!!!!
