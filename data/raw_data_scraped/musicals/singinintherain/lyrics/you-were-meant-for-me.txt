You Were Meant for Me


Don:

Life was a song,

You came along

I've laid awake the whole night through

If I ever dared to think you'd care

This is what I'd say to you



You were meant for me

And I was meant for you

Nature patterned you

And when she was done

You were all the sweet things

Rolled up in one



You're like a plaintive melody

That never lets me free

But I'm content

The angels must have sent you

And they meant you just for me...



But I'm content

The angels must have sent you

And they meant you just for me...
