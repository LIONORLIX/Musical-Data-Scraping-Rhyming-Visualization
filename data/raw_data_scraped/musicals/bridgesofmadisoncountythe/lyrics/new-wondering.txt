New Wondering


ROBERT

A little twinge,

A little shock,

A little whisper at the bottom of your memory.

A sudden wind,

A gentle knock,

And then a rustle in the leaves.

You hold your breath,

You check the lock,

You reassure yourself that nothing’s at the window.



But you’re wondering.

You’re wondering.

You’re wondering what that was.

Nothing’s gonna happen.



You turn a key,

You flip a switch,

You settle back into the blissful unfamiliar.

You close your eyes,

But there’s an itch,

A little hurt your heart retrieves.

But you ignore

The tiny twitch,

Pretend the feeling will be gone before the morning.



But you’re wondering.

You’re wondering.

You’re wondering where you are.

Nothing’s gonna happen.



Nothing’s gonna happen.



But wouldn’t it be fine to share

The weather in her eyes, her hair,

Her footsteps as she climbs the stair,

The shadow in her light’



But everything you know is true

And everything you want to do

And everything that makes you you

Collides against the night.

And nothing’s black and white.



And you’re wondering.

You’re wondering.

You’re wondering what to do.

You’re wondering.

You’re wondering.



You’re wondering if it’s true.

Nothing’s gonna happen.

Nothing has to happen.
