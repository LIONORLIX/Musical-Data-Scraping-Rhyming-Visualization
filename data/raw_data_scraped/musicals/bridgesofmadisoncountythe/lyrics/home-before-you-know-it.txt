Home Before You Know It


BUD

Fran, you know the drill.

Now, look, if anything goes wrong -

I know you think it never will,

But if it does,

They know next door

You're here alone.



Now Fran, you're free and clear,

We got the fences fixed already,

So while we're out with the steer,

You should be fine.

And if you're not,

Pick up the phone.



You know there's room for you to come,

Although, I take it back, there's not.

We got the cow, we got the kids,

And then the tent, which I forgot.

We better get out on the road

Before the trailer gets too hot,



But we'll be home before you know.

We'll be home before you notice that we're gone.

Three days isn't very long,

And so if anything goes wrong,

Just hold on tight -

The end's in sight -

And we'll be home.



MICHAEL

I'm gonna drive!

Last year, you said

When I was sixteen,

I could drive?

And I'm sixteen!

You gonna go back on

your Word?

Come on! I drive

Better'n you.

I tell you now -

I won't be squeezin' in the middle

I'm not squeezin' in the middle!

BUD

What?

I do not think so, Michael.







Right now I am talking to

Your mother!



Michael, get the lunch!

What did I say?

Go get the Lunch!

Jesus!



MICHAEL



How 'bout if I just

Drive the last mile?

So we can come in that

Fair in style?

Oh!

I can't believe this.



BUD

I've got to move it out right now

I don't have time to sit and wait,

We get a worse spot in the stall

For every minute that we're late!

And I can see by how you're lookin'

That you think it's really great

That we'll be home before you know it.

We'll be home

And then I won't do this again.

Year sure, you're laughin' at me now,

When I got two kids and a cow

I gotta show

We gotta go

Then we'll be home.



FRANCESCA

Sweetheart, it's Mom.



CARLOYN

Why does he have to be a jerk?



FRANCESCA

I'm sorry you got upset with Dad, but you've worked so hard with Steve. All you have to do now is go to Indianapolis? so he can win Steer of the Year.



CAROLYN

Why do you have to sound like him?

Why do you have to say what he says?

You don't care about the farm.



FRANCESCA

Carolyn. This could be your college education right here.



CAROLYN

You should have made him stay in Italy

Then I could be Italian

And you could be happy

And I wouldn't have to marry a farmer.



FRANCESCA

You don't have to marry a farmer.



CAROLYN

Nobody asks me what I want!



BUD

Carolyn!



CAROLYN

Ti amo, mama. Coming!



BUD

You'll be OK here, right?



FRANCESCA

I've got a book I want to read, I've got new recipes to try,

Or I might just spend 3 days sitting here and staring at the sky,

But I can't get out of this kitchen 'till you finally say goodbye,

And you'll be home before I know it.



BUD

Ok then, we'll see you Thursday.



FRANCESCA

You'll be home before I notice that you're gone.



BUD

We'll call from the road. All right, here we go!



FRANCESCA

You'll be home before I know it.
