Falling Into You


ROBERT

What was I saying before about being lost?

The thing is, I knew where I was,

But not where I was going.

Why did I walk those mountains?

Why did I ride those ships?

Why did I watch those horses running wild?

Now I know.

Now I know.



All my life, I have been falling.

I have been falling into you,

Francesca.

Circling in the sky,

Looking for a harbor

Coming into view.

All my life, I have been falling

Into you.



FRANCESCA

Whatever this is?

Whatever we do from here, don't give it a name.

We mustn't reduce it to something clear or simple.

I want to believe that we are the first people on Earth to

Know this feeling,

To know this moment,

To cross this line.



ROBERT

Adding up all those minutes

Staring through all I saw,

How could I know the answer

Would be you?



FRANCESCA

How could I know the answer

Would be you?



ROBERT

Only you.



ROBERT AND FRANCESCA

All my life I have been falling.

I have been falling into you,

Francesca.

This is where I land.

You are what I've looked for.

Now is what is true.

All my life,



ROBERT

I have been falling

Into you.
