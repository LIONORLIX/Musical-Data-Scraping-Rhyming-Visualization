Something From a Dream


BUD

You shoulda seen me back in ?46.

I was in uniform, spit-shined, whippet-thin

Hard as a brick, dumb as a post,

But I was having the time of my life

and I met Frannie there in Italy

Boy, she was beautiful, but all those guys around her,

Look, Italians, no offense, the laziest people in the world.



And to me, she looked like something from a dream.

And to her, I?m like the conquering American.

I?m gonna take her on a trip this year.



We?ll bring the harvest in, then take a coupla days,

Maybe a weekend at the Fort Des Moines

Once we get past Christmas and the kids are back at school.



I mean, it?s not like she complains at all.

It?s just, you gotta pay attention,

And with all the other crap I?m takin? care of,

She might feel embarrassed

Takin? time to tell me what she needs.



And to me she?s still like something from a dream.

And to her, I?m like the guy who keeps the lights turned on.

I?m gonna take her on a trip this year.

Maybe next summer.

Not like we?re gonna have the money for vacations.

I guess we?ll figure something out...
