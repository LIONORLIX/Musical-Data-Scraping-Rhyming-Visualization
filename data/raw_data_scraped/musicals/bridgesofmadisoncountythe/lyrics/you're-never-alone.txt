You're Never Alone


Bud

Went down to the hansen place to check on bob and the kid.

One look at that fella’s face, i guess i knew what he did.

Too proud to admit he’s stuck when all his crops went down.

Lord knows we’d’ve backed him up to get a loan in town.



Damn fool, when the bills came through,

He couldn’t think of anything else to do ‘

Thought he was gonna lose the farm.

Waits ‘til cora goes to town,

Turns the thresher on and then lays right down,

So the hospital took off half his arm.



I know it ain’t easy,

This is a long road.

Nothin’ Is easy out there on your own,

But if you’re ready to stand up,

I tell ya, by god’s grace,

We’re all from the same place,

Right down to the bone:

You’re never alone.



Francesca

Everybody pitched in. People show up when you need them.



Charlie

Went down to the hansen place to check on cora and bob...



Michael

Went by with the trailer-hitch, but that’s a hell of a job.



Bud

Language, michael.



Marge

Brought cora a chicken stew, she’s barely eaten for weeks.



Carolyn

Told henry to wipe his hands and stand up straight when he speaks.



Bud

Cleaned out the ammonia drums.



Carolyn

Cleaned the attic out for when bob’s brother comes.



Michael

Pulled in six acres overall.



Marge

Had a talk with the bank in ames.



Charlie

Got the state farm guys to speed up the claims.



Company

They’re gonna make it through the fall.



But you know it ain’t easy.

This is a long road.

Nothin’ Is easy out there on your own.

But if you’re ready to stand up,

We’re standin’ Beside you,

Reach out and we’ll guide you



Company

Oh, oh, oh oh...

Oh, oh, oh oh...

Oh, oh, oh oh...



Through the great unknown:



You’re never alone.

You’re never alone.

You’re never alone.



Bud (pointedly to francesca)

You’re never alone.
