Who We Are and Who We Want to Be


ROBERT

Maybe you sleep so peaceful

Because you haven't got a worry in your head.

Mm.

Or maybe you keep your eyes closed

So you never have to get out of this bed.

Mm.

Well, you don't have to make the toast

Or get the kids to school,

So rest your head stay here close to me.

There's nothin' in this world today

But who we are and who we want to be.



And lying here with curtains drawn,

Your hair across my chest,

I can't think what else I would need to see.

There's nothing in this world today

But who we are and who we want to be.



FRANCESCA

Oh, oh oh. Oh, oh.

Oh, oh, oh, oh.



FRANCESCA AND ROBERT

Oh, oh, oh. Oh, oh.

Oh, oh, oh, oh.



COMPANY

Oh, oh, oh. Oh, oh.

Oh, oh, oh, oh.



Oh, oh, oh. Oh, oh.

Oh, oh, oh, oh.



ROBERT

And maybe after all these years

Of lookin' for a home,

A woman in a farmhouse held the key.

There's nothing in this world today

But who we are and who we're meant to be.
