One Second and a Million Miles


ROBERT

For the first time in my life,

I am not outside the moment

With a camera in between me and the world

I think I know.

For the first time in my life,

I am somehow part of something.

You surround me, you connect me,

And I think I can't let go.

For the first time in my life,

You have opened up a channel

There is nothing to contain us,

We are joined, and we are free.

For the first time in my life,

I am risking something precious.

I am asking you, Francesca:

Come with me.



I can't tell you I know what the future will be.

Who knows anything?

I just look at those eyes; you've got so much to see.

Let me know you. There's

Crowds and camels and hillsides to climb.

All I know is, in all of the time

From man's first breath

To God's last warning,

You and I are just one second,

Spinning by in one split-second.

You and I have just one second

And a million miles to go.



I don't need to be rich, I don't need something new.



FRANCESCA

I don't want t go back to a world without this.



ROBERT

All I need, all I've needed my whole life was you.



FRANCESCA

If I left this behind?



Robert

Please just look at me:

You were born with a wanderer's soul.

This is how you begin to be whole.

The stars keep burning,

Worlds keep turning



ROBERT AND FRANCESCA

And you and I are just one second,

Spinning by in just one second,

You and I have just one second



ROBERT

And a million miles to go..



FRANCESCA

Found and lost.

Torn in half.

Before and after you.



ROBERT

Come with me.



FRANCESCA

Open heart,

Open door.

Before and after you.



ROBERT

Come with me.



FRANCESCA

How do I go?

Tell me.

How do I go?

How do I go with you?

How do I pack a bag,

Close a door,

Turn a key,

Walk away?

Look at where I am

And who I am

And tell me.

Is there something I don't know?

How do I go?

How can I go

With you?



ROBERT

I can't tell you I know what the answer will be.

It's impossible.

But this thing, this is bigger than what we can see.

This is destiny.

We are tied, we are locked, we are bound;

This will not be reversed or unwound.

Whatever fate the stars are weaving,

We're not breaking,

I'm not leaving,

And you and I are just one second.

Spinning by in just one second.

You and I have just one second?



FRANCESCA

And a million miles to go.



ROBERT

All my life I have been falling?



FRANCESCA

All my life I have been falling?



ROBERT

All my life I have been falling into?



FRANCESCA

All my life I have been falling?



ROBERT

You and I



ROBERT AND FRANCESCA

Have just one second



ROBERT

And a million miles to go.



FRANCESCA

Come with me.
