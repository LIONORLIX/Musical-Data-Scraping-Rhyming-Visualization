When I'm Gone


CHARLIE

When I'm gone,

When I'm gone,

Take me out into my cornfields,

Set me deep,

Lay me low

When I've crossed over.

And these fields will be

My legacy

When I'm gone.



When I'm gone,

Come what may,

When I'm with my Lord in Heaven,

I'll look down

At this place

When I've crossed over.

Let it stay somehow

Like it is right now

When I'm gone.



COMPANY AND MICHAEL

Oo?

Oo oo oo?

Oo oo oo? Oo oo-

Oo ah!

COMPANY

Ooh? Ooh?

Ooh? Ooh?



CHARLIE

Oh, when I was born,

I had tomorrows stretched before me,

But the yesterdays piled up

From that day on.



BUD

When I'm gone,

When I'm gone,

I will see the clouds below me,

And my child

And his child

When I've crossed over.



Let them feel the pride

That I've kept inside.

When I'm gone.



COMPANY

Glory! Glory!

Glory! Glory!

Glory! Glory!

Ah!

COMPANY

Ooh? Ooh?

Ooh? Ooh?



BUD AND CHARLIE

Oh, when I was born,

I had tomorrows stretched before me,

But the yesterdays piled up

From that day on.



BUD

When I'm gone,

When I'm gone,

I'll sing Glory, Hallelujah!

For my work

Will be done

When I've crossed over.

And I know you'll know

That I loved you so

When I'm gone.



ANd this love will be

ALl that's left of me,

When I'm gone.
