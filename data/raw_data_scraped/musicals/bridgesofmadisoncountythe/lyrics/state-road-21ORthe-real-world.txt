State Road 21/The Real World


GIRL SINGER

Come on, children, and climb in the back seat!

Come on, children, it's time for some fun!

Get inside, we're gonna take a ride

On State Road 21!



Come on, children, I filled up the gas tank.

Long way to go before we get done.

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

On State Road 21!



GIRL SINGER AND COMPANY

Fiddle solo!



MICHAEL

Since 9 p.m., I been sittin' here,

Just keeping' my eye on some stupid steer.

That's how I'm spending' my Junior year!

But I swear I'm gettin' wise.



It's my last time here, I guarantee!

I got other places I'm s'posed to be.

I won't have my old man ridin' me

'Til the day he up and dies.



Oh, oh, what does he know

When his head's been buried in the ground so low?

Oh, oh, what does he know

About life in the real world?

I said, Oh, oh, what does he know?

My fuse is lit and I'm gonna blow,

'Cause Oh, oh, I gotta know

About life in the real world.



CAROLYN

I got a ringin' in my ears

And my hands keep shakin'.

I ate seven corn dogs

And I think I might die.

Five more hours

'Til the final judging.

I can hold it all together

And I will not cry.



Oh God! Do I have a fever?

Oh God, things are startin' to swirl.

Oh God, I was doin' so well,

Now they're all gonna think I'm just a dumb little girl.



Well, oh, oh, what do they know

About what it takes to make a bull calf grow?

Oh, oh, what do they know

About life in the real world?



CAROLYN AND MICHAEL

Oh, oh, what do they know?



CAROLYN

Prob'ly came over from Ohio.



CAROLYN AND MICHAEL

And oh, oh, what do they know

About life in the real world?



GIRL SINGER

Let's go, baby, and roll by the river

Feel the heat comin' down from the sun -

Oh oh oh oh

On State Road 21!

Ev'rybody:
