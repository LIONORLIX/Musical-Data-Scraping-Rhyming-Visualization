To Build a Home


FRANCESCA

There's a boat that leaves from Napoli

Every Thursday in the morning

And a nervous bride can share a bed

With her soldier from the States.

For a week, the ocean carries them

Over lost and churning water

And they land in New York Harbor

Then to Pennsylvania Station

Where they board a train

That slices like a scythe

Through the fields of America.



This is Albany

This is Buffalo

This is Cleveland

This is South bend

This is Chicago

This is Osceola Station

Where a truck will take them

Deeper into Iowa

To Winterset

And three hundred Acres

Waiting to be tamed.



And blade of grass by blade of grass

And ear of corn by ear of corn

And bale of Hay by day by day

They build themselves a home.

And day by day and year by year,

From boy to man, from calf to steer,

What's lost from there may not grow here,

But comes the sun,

Look what they've done:

They've built themselves a home.



Years begin passing, from 1948 to 1950 to 1951. If this were a realistic set, a farmhouse would appear.



At Twenty-one, a girl begins

To grasp the world and how it spins.

She grabs a box of safety pins

And builds herself a home.

And home is safe, and home is fair,

The porch, the bath, the kitchen chair,

The sharp and unfamiliar air

That blow by blow

She comes to know

To build herself a home.



It is now 1965. Her husband BUD, 45, her son MICHAEL, 16, and her daughter CAROLYN, 14, come onstage. FRANCESCA is 38 now.



With a son.

And a daughter.

And a million miles between

The fires she used to set

The hearts she used to break

The lies she used to tell

And the woman she grew up

to be.



COMPANY

Aaah?

Aaah?

Aaah?

Aaah?

Aaah?

Aaah?



FRANCESCA

I learn to speak, I learn to sew,

I learn to let the longing go,



COMPANY

Ah?Ah?Ah?Aaah?

Aaah?

Aaah?

The tractor wheel, a food of snow,

I build myself a home.



I change my words, I change my name,

The fields go dry, the horse goes lame,

The county fair, the football game,

For eighteen years,

It stays the same,

For eighteen years,

I'm proud I came

And built myself a home.



COMPANY

Aaah?

Aaah?

Ah! Ah!
