Before and After You


FRANCESCA

Holding you close against my skin,

And pulling you inside me,

Suddenly there's a world I never know.

Kissing you now, the waves begin

And evermore divide me:

Before and after you.



You, with a touch, at once erased

The lines and walls around me.

How did you know exactly what to do?

Feeling your fingers on my waist,

I know my fate has found me:

Before and after you.



ROBERT

I love you, Francesca.



FRANCESCA

And I love you. More than my own life, I love you.
