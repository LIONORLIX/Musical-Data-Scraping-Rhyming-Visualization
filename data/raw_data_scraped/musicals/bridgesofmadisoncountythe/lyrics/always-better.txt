Always Better


FRANCESCA

You could have driven into someone else's driveway.

You could have tried to find the bridge another day.

I could have gone off to the fair,

Or locked the door, or washed my hair,

And in a way, that would be better.



We could have chosen to ignore what we were feeling.

We could have prayed to make the wanting go away,

But what we did

Is that we loved,

And love is always better.



I could have gone with you and left behind the cornfields.

I could have seen a world like none I'd ever known.

I could have tied my dreams to yours

And slept beside you on the moors

And who can say? That might be better.



I could have not been where my children turned for answers,

And never seen what they've become now that they're grown,

But what I did

Is that I loved

And love is always better.



It is hard,

It is insane

To place one love

Above another,

But what a choice!

And what a gift!

And what a blessing!



COMPANY

Oh!



FRANCESCA

I could have never known

That love like this existed,

But then you kissed me

And you left and then I knew,

But what is true

Is that we loved,

And that I loved,

And that I love,

And I will always love

And love

Is always better.

ROBERT

You and I

Are just one second.

Spinning by

In one split-second.

You and I

Have just one second

And a million miles to go.
