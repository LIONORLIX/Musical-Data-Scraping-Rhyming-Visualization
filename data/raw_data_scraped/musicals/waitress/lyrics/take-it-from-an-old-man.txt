Take It From an Old Man


Joe:

Take it from an old man.

Time's just sand slipping past.

We wanna hold it in our hands,

But no one ever sees

What falls through the cracks.

Take it from an old man.

My mistakes have made me,

And i am what i am,

And though i dont believe in silver linings,

I belive there's something in you.

Something good is trying to break through.

You might have to fight the good fight.

And when you think you can't, you can.

Take it from an old man.



Take it from an old man.

The days don't stretch any longer.

They've left tracks upon my skin,

But i reckon made me stronger,

But i believe there's something in you.

Something you should be seeing too.

Let it all on yourself at least one time.

Cause honey win or lose,

It's one hell of a ride.



Soloist:

It's one hell of a ride



Joe:

And if you like the strength of your own,

Honey, hold out your hands and

Take it from an old man.
