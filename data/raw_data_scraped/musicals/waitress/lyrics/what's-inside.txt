What's Inside


Sugar, sugar

Sugar, butter

Sugar, butter

Sugar, butter, flour

Sugar, butter, flour

Sugar, butter, flour

Sugar, butter, flour



My hands pluck the things I know that I'll need

I take the sugar and butter from the pantry

I add the flour to begin what I am hoping to start

And then it's down with the recipe

And bake from the heart



Sugar

And butter

And flour

And mother



What's inside?

Everyone wants to know what's inside

And I always tell them but I

Feel more than words can say

You wanna know what's inside?

Simple question, so then what's the answer?

My whole life is in here

In this kitchen baking

What a mess I'm making
