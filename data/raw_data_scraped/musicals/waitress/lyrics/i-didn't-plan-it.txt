I Didn't Plan It


Go ahead

Throw your rocks at me

From your little glass house

And then take off running

You're no better than me

We've both made mistakes haven't we



I won't undo what I'm doing

Sit in judgment of what makes us human

I don't claim to be proud

But my head won't be hung in shame



I didn't plan it

But the light turned red, and I ran it

And I'm still standing

It's not what I wanted, but now that it's right here



I understand it

A story written by my own hand

It's life biting right at your heels

I didn't plan it

But it's finally something to feel

Oh



Look around you

Ain't no saints here baby

We're all just looking for a little less crazy

And sometimes it's a hard left turn

Down a road you'd never thought you'd see



I didn't plan it

Taking back what's been taken for granted

'Cause I can't stand it

I'm sick of the way I've been waiting to break free

I needed saving

And a good mistake needed making

Maybe you need the same thing



Something to feel

To race through your blood

And remind you you're here

To open your eyes and look around

And see the sky when you're on the ground



I didn't plan it

But that's life and I'm finally feeling alive

It's not right but it's mine

And it's finally something to feel
