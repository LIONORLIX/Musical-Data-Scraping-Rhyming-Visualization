Bad Idea (Reprise)


Hearts keep racing

There's no mistaking

We can't come back from this

Good, 'cause I want more of what I've had

It feels so good to (feels so good)

To be bad

To be bad



[Spoken] 'In The Dark' dark chocolate pie



Take this bad idea and walk this wire

Throw your spark into oil and fire

Chance won't come every single day

So don't throw it away

Don't throw it away



We might burn

But we might get saved

I don't feel much fire at all these days

Feels so good to (feels so good)



To be bad
