You Will Still Be Mine


Earl:

Remember my clean shave

Back in our old days

When we would just kiss?

I had my six string,

And you had your own thing

Though i don't remember what it is.

I wrote you love songs,

And you liked that sad one,

So i played it all the time.

What was that one line?

Something 'bout sunshine.

I sang it every night.

"where the sun don't shine."



Earl (spoken): no. That can't be it.



Earl:

"when the sun don't shine."



Earl (spoken): what was it baby?



Jenna:

'Till the sun don't shine

You will still be mine



Earl (spoken): yah, that's right.



Earl:

Man, what a whirlwind?

So much is happ'nin',

And mostly to me.

We've come such a long way.

No turning back now, babe.

You're my family.



Earl (spoken): now, promise me.



Earl:

'Till the end of time

These are ties that bind



Earl (spoken): sing it, honey.



Jenna:

'Till the sun don't shine



Both:

You will still be mine



Earl:

Mine.

Mmm mine.

Mine
