Away, Away! My Heart's on Fire


TRIO: Away, away! my heart's on fire



KING/RUTH: Away, away! my heart's on fire;

I burn, this base deception to repay.

This very night my vengeance dire

Shall glut itself in gore. Away, away!



FREDERIC: Away, away! ere I expire--

I find my duty hard to do to-day!

My heart is filled with anguish dire,

It strikes me to the core. Away, away!



KING: With falsehood foul

He tricked us of our brides.

Let vengeance howl;

The Pirate so decides.

Our nature stern

He softened with his lies,

And, in return,

To-night the traitor dies.



ALL: Yes, yes! to-night the traitor dies!

Yes, yes! to-night the traitor dies!



RUTH: To-night he dies!



KING: Yes, or early to-morrow.



FREDERIC: His girls likewise?



RUTH: They will welter in sorrow.



KING: The one soft spot



RUTH: In their natures they cherish--



FREDERIC: And all who plot



KING: To abuse it shall perish!



ALL: To-night he dies, etc.
