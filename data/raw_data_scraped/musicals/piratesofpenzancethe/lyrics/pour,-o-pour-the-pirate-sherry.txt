Pour, O Pour the Pirate Sherry


All.

Pour, oh, pour the pirate sherry,

Fill, O fill the pirate glass!

And, to make us more than merry,

Let the pirate bumper pass!



Samuel.

For today our pirate 'prentice

Rises from indenture freed;

Strong his arm, and keen his scent is

He?s a pirate now indeed!



Chorus.

Here?s good luck to Frederic?s ventures!

Frederic?s out of his indentures.





Samuel.

Two and twenty, now he?s rising,

And alone he?s fit to fly,

Which we?re bent on signalizing

With unusual revelry.



Chorus.

Here?s good luck to Frederic?s ventures!

Frederic?s out of his indentures.



Samuel & Chorus.

Pour, oh, pour the pirate sherry,

Fill, O fill the pirate glass!

And, to make us more than merry,

Let the pirate bumper pass!
