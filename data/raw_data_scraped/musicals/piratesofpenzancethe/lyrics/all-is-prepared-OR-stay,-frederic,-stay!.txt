All Is Prepared / Stay, Frederic, Stay!


MABEL

All is prepared, your gallant crew await you.

My Frederic in tears? It cannot be

That lion-heart quails at the coming conflict?



FREDERIC

No, Mabel, no.

A terrible disclosure

Has just been made.

Mabel, my dearly-loved one,

I bound myself to serve the pirate captain

Until I reached my one-and-twentieth birthday



MABEL

But you are twenty-one?



FREDERIC

I've just discovered

That I was born in leap-year, and that birthday

Will not be reached by me till nineteen forty!



MABEL

Oh, horrible! catastrophe appalling!



FREDERIC

And so, farewell!



MABEL

No, no!

Ah, Frederic, hear me.
