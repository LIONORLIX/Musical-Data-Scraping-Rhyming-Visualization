Hold, Monsters!


Hold Monsters!

Ere your pirate caravanserie proceed

against our wills to wed us all

just bear in mind that we are Wards in Chancery,

And our Father is the major general!



(Samuel)

We'd better fall,

for danger may befall.

Their father is a major general!



(Daughters)

Yes, yes, he is a major general!



(Major-General Stanley)

Yes, yes, I am the major general!
