Finale


GIRLS.

Now what is this, and what is that, and why does father leave his rest

At such a time of night as this, so very incompletely dressed?

Dear father is, and always was, the most methodical of men!

It's his invariable rule to go to bed at half-past ten.

What strange occurrence can it be that calls dear father from his rest

At such a time of night as this, so very incompletely dressed?



(Enter KING, SAMUEL, and FREDERIC)



KING.

Forward, my men, and seize that General there!

His life is over.



(They seize the GENERAL)

GIRLS.

The pirates! the pirates! Oh, despair!



PIRATES.

(springing up)



Yes, we're the pirates, so despair!



GENERAL.

Frederic here! Oh, joy! Oh. rapture!

Summon your men and effect their capture!



MABEL.

Frederic, save us!



FREDERIC.

Beautiful Mabel,

I would if I could, but I am not able.



PIRATES.

He's telling the truth, he is not able.



KING.

With base deceit

You worked upon our feelings!

Revenge is sweet,

And flavours all our dealings!

With courage rare

And resolution manly,

For death prepare,

Unhappy Gen'ral Stanley.



MABEL.

(wildly)



Is he to die, unshriven, unannealed?



GIRLS.

Oh, spare him!



MABEL.

Will no one in his cause a weapon wield?



GIRLS.

Oh, spare him!



POLICE.

(springing up)



Yes, we are here, though hitherto concealed!



GIRLS.

Oh, rapture!



POLICE.

So to Constabulary, pirates yield!



GIRLS.

Oh, rapture!



PIRATES and POLICE



We/You triumph now, for well we trow

Your/Our mortal career's cut short;

No pirate band will take its stand

At the Central Criminal Court.



SERGEANT.

To gain a brief advantage you've contrived,

But your proud triumph will not be long-lived

KING.

Don't say you are orphans, for we know that game.



SERGEANT.

On your allegiance we've a stronger claim.

We charge you yield, we charge you yield,

In Queen Victoria's name!



KING.

(baffled)



You do?



POLICE.

We do!

We charge you yield,

In Queen Victoria's name!



(PIRATES kneel, POLICE stand over them triumphantly.)



KING.

We yield at once, with humbled mien,

Because, with all our faults, we love our Queen.



POLICE.

Yes, yes, with all their faults, they love their Queen.



ALL.

Yes, yes, with all their faults, they love their Queen.



(POLICE, holding PIRATES by the collar, take out handkerchiefs and weep.)



GENERAL.

Away with them, and place them at the bar!



(Enter RUTH)



RUTH.

One moment! let me tell you who they are.

They are no members of the common throng;

They are all noblemen who have gone wrong.



ALL.

They are all noblemen who have gone wrong.



GENERAL.

No Englishman unmoved that statement hears,

Because, with all our faults, we love our House of

Peers.



(All kneel)

I pray you, pardon me, ex-Pirate King!

Peers will be peers, and youth will have its fling.

Resume your ranks and legislative duties,

And take my daughters, all of whom are beauties.





FINALE--MABEL, EDITH and ENSEMBLE

Poor wandering ones!

Though ye have surely strayed,

Take heart of grace,

Your steps retrace,

Poor wandering ones!

Poor wandering ones!

If such poor love as ours

Can help you find

True peace of mind,

Why, take it, it is yours!



ALL.

Poor wandering ones! etc.
