Now, Frederic, Let Your Escort Lion-Hearted When the Foeman Bares His Steel


Sergeant.

When the foeman bares his steel,



Police.

Tarantara! tarantara!



Sergeant.

We uncomfortable feel,



Police.

Tarantara!



Sergeant.

And we find the wisest thing,



Police.

Tarantara! tarantara!



Sergeant.

Is to slap our chests and sing,



Sergeant & Police.

Tarantara! tarantara!



Sergeant.

For when threatened with emeutes,



Police.

Tarantara! tarantara!



Sergeant.

And your heart is in your boots,



Police.

Tarantara!



Sergeant.

There is nothing brings it round

Like the trumpet's martial sound,

Like the trumpet's martial sound



Sergeant & Police.

Tarantara! tarantara!



Sergeant& First Bass.

Tarantara! tarantara!

Tarantara! tarantara!

Tarantara! tarantara!

Tarantara! tarantara!

Tarantara! tarantara!

Tarantara, ra, ra,

Tarantara!



Second Bass.

Ra, ra, ra, ra,

Ra, ra, ra, ra,

Ra, ra, ra, ra,

Ra, ra, ra, ra,

Ra, ra, ra, ra,

Tarantara, ra, ra,

Tarantara!



Mabel.

Go, ye heroes, go to glory,

Though you die in combat gory,

Ye shall live in song and story.

Go to immortality!

Go to death, and go to slaughter;

Die, and every Cornish daughter

With her tears your grave shall water.

Go, ye heroes, go and die!



Girls.

Go, ye heroes, go and die!

Go, ye heroes, go and die!



Sergeant.

Though to us it's evident,



Police.

Tarantara! tarantara!



Sergeant.

These attentions are well meant,



Police.

Tarantara!



Sergeant.

Such expressions don't appear,



Police.

Tarantara! tarantara!



Sergeant.

Calculated men to cheer,



Police.

Tarantara!



Sergeant.

Who are going to meet their fate

In a highly nervous state.



Police.

Tarantara! tarantara! tarantara!



Sergeant.

Still to us it's evident

These attentions are well meant.



Police.

Tarantara! tarantara! tarantara!



Edith.

Go and do your best endeavour,

And before all links we sever,

We will say farewell for ever.

Go to glory and the grave!



Girls.

Go to glory and the grave!

For your foes are fierce and ruthless,

False, unmerciful, and truthless;

Young and tender, old and toothless,

All in vain their mercy crave.



Sergeant.

We observe too great a stress,

On the risks that on us press,

And of reference a lack

To our chance of coming back.

Still, perhaps it would be wise

Not to carp or criticise,

For it's very evident

These attentions are well meant.



Police.

Yes, it's very evident

These attentions are well meant,

Evident,

Yes, well meant;

Evident,



Sergeant & Police.

Ah, yes, well meant!



(All three parts repeat at same time.)



General.

Away, away!

These pirates slay!

Then do not stay!

Then why this delay!



Yes, but you don't go!



Yes, but you don't go!



At last they go,

At last they go, at last they go!

At last they really, really go!



Girls.

Yes, forward on the foe,



They go, they go!



Yes, forward on the foe,



At last they go,

At last they go, at last they go!

At last they really, really go!



Police.

Yes, yes, we go!



Tarantara!



Tarantara!



All right, we go!

Yes forward

on the foe, Yes, forward on the foe,



We go, we go!

Yes forward

on the foe, Yes, forward on the foe,



We go, we go,

We go, we go,

We go, we go, we go, we go!
