Stay, We Must Not Lose Our Senses


Stay, we must not lose our senses,

Men who stick at no offenses

Will anon be here!

Piracy their dreadful trade is;

Pray you, get you hence young ladies,

While the coast is clear!



Daughters:

No, we must not lose our senses,

If they stick at no offenses

We should not be here!

Piracy their dreadful trade is;

Nice companions for young ladies,

Let us disap..



Too late!



Pirates:

Ha, ha!



Daughters:

Too late!



Pirates:

Ho, ho! Ha, ha, ha, ha! Ho, ho, ho, ho!



Here's a first rate opportunity

To get married with impunity

And indulge in the felicity

Of unbounded domesticity.

You shall quickly be parsonified,

Conjugally matrimonified,

By a Doctor of Divinity

Who is located in this vicinity.



Pirates and Daughters:

By a Doctor of Divinity

Who resides in this vicinity.

By a Doctor, a Doctor, a Doctor,

Of Divinity,

Of Divinity.
