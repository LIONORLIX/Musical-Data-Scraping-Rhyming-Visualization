Climbing over Rocky Mountain


Chorus.

Climbing over rocky mountain,

Skipping rivulet and fountain,

Passing where the weeping willows quiver

Passing where the willows quiver,

By the ever-rolling river,

Swollen with the summer rain,

The summer rain.

Threading long and leafy mazes

Dotted with unnumbered daisies,

Dotted, dotted with unnumbered daisies;

Scaling rough and rugged passes,

Climb the hardy little lasses,

Till the bright sea-shore they gain!

Scaling rough and rugged passes,

Climb the hardy little lasses,

Till the bright sea-shore they gain!



Edith.

Let us gaily tread the measure,

Make the most of fleeting leisure,

Hail it as a true ally,

Though it perish by-and-by.



Chorus.

Hail it as a true ally,

Though it perish by-and-by.



Edith.

Every moment brings a treasure

Of its own especial pleasure;

Though the moments quickly die,

Greet them gaily as they fly,

Greet them gaily as they fly.

Chorus.

Though the moments quickly die,

Greet them gaily as they fly.



Kate.

Far away from toil and care,

Reveling in fresh sea-air,

Here we live and reign alone

In a world that's all our own.

Here, in this our rocky den,

Far away from mortal men,

We'll be queens, and make decrees -

They may honor them who please.

Chorus.

We'll be queens, and make decrees -

They may honor them who please.



All.

Let us gaily tread the measure,

Make the most of fleeting leisure,

Hail it as a true ally,

Though it perish by-and-by.

Hail it as a true ally,

Though it perish by-and-by.

Let us gaily tread the measure,

Make the most of fleeting leisure,

Hail it as a true ally,

A true ally.
