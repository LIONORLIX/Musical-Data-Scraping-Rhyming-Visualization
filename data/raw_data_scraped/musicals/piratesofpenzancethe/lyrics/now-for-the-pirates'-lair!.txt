Now for the Pirates' Lair!


FREDERIC

Now for the pirates' lair! Oh, joy unbounded!

Oh, sweet relief! Oh, rapture unexampled!

At last I may atone, in some slight measure,

For the repeated acts of theft and pillage

Which, at a sense of duty's stern dictation,

I, circumstance's victim, have been guilty!



KING

Young Frederic! (Covering him with pistol)



FREDERIC

Who calls?



KING

Your late commander!



RUTH

And I, your little Ruth! (Covering him with pistol)



FREDERIC

Oh, mad intruders,

How dare ye face me? Know ye not, oh rash ones,

That I have doomed you to extermination? (KING and RUTH

hold a pistol to each ear)



KING

Have mercy on us! hear us, ere you slaughter!



FREDERIC

I do not think I ought to listen to you.

Yet, mercy should alloy our stern resentment,

And so I will be merciful-- say on!
