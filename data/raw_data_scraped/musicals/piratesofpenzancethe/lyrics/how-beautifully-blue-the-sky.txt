How Beautifully Blue the Sky


Chorus of Girls:

How Beautifully Blue the sky

The glass is rising very high

Continue fine I hope it may

And yet it rained but yesterday

Tomorrow it may pour again

I hear the country wants some rain

Yet people say

I know not why

That we shall have a warm July

Tomorrow it may pour again

I hear the country wants some rain

Yet people say

I know not why

That we shall have a warm July

Mabel:

Did ever maiden wake from dream of homely duty

To find her daylight break with such exceeding beauty

Did ever maiden close her eyes on waking sadness

To dream of such exceeding gladness!

Frederic:

Ah yes, ah yes,

This is exceeding gladness

How Beautifully Blue the sky

The glass is rising very high

Continue fine I hope it may

And yet it rained but yesterday

Tomorrow it may pour again

I hear the country wants some rain

Yet people say

I know not why

That we shall have a warm July

Tomorrow it may pour again

I hear the country wants some rain

Yet people say

I know not why

That we shall have a warm July

Frederic:

Did ever pirate roll his soul in guilty dreaming

And wake to find that soul with peace and virtue beaming!

How Beautifully Blue the sky

The glass is rising very high

Continue fine I hope it may

And yet it rained but yesterday

Tomorrow it may pour again

I hear the country wants some rain

Yet people say

I know not why

That we shall have a warm July

Mabel

Did ever maiden wake from dream of homely duty

To find her daylight break with such exceeding beauty

Did ever maiden close her eyes on waking sadness

To dream of such exceeding gladness!

Frederic

Did ever pirate loathed

Forsake his hideous mission

To find himself bethrothed to lady of position!

Ah yes, ah yes,

Ah yes, ah yes,

AH YES!
