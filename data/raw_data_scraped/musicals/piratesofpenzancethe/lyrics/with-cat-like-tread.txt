With Cat-Like Tread


Pirates

With Cat-Like Tread

Upon our prey we steal

In silence dread

Our cautious way we feel

No sound at all

We never speak a word

A fly's foot-fall

Would be distinctly heard



Police:

Tarantara, Tarantara.



Pirates:

So stealthily the pirate creeps

While all the household soundly sleeps



Come friends, who plough the sea

Truce to navigation

Take another station

Let's vary piracy

With a little burglary



Samuel:

Here's your crowbar

And your centre bit

Your life preserver

You may want to hit



Your silent matches

Your dark lantern seize

Take your file

And your skeletonic keys



Police:

Tarantara,

Pirates:

With Cat like tread

Police:

Tarantara

Pirates:

In silence dread



Pirates

Truce to navigation

Take another station

Let's vary piracy

With a little burglary



With cat like tread

Upon our prey we steal

In silence dread

Our cautious way we feel
