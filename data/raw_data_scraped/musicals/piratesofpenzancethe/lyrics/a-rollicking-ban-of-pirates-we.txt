A Rollicking Ban of Pirates We


Pirates.

A rollicking band of pirates we,

Who, tired of tossing on the sea,

Are trying their hand at a burglaree,

With weapons grim and gory.



Sergeant.

Hush, hush! I hear them on the manor poaching,

With stealthy step the pirates are approaching.



Chorus of Pirates, resumed nearer.



Pirates.

We are not coming for plate or gold -

A story General Stanley's told -

We seek a penalty fifty-fold,

For General Stanley's story.



Police.

They seek a penalty



Pirates.

Fifty-fold!

We seek a penalty



Police.

Fifty-fold!



Pirates & Police.

They/We seek a penalty fifty-fold,

For General Stanley's story.



Sergeant.

They come in force, with stealthy stride,

Our obvious course is now - to hide.



Police.

Tarantara, tarantara!

Tarantara, tarantara!
