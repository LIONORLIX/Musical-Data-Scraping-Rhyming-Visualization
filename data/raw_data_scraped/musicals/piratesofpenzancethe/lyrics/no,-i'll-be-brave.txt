No, I'll be brave


MABEL: (almost fainting) No, I'll be brave!

Oh, family descent,

How great thy charm, thy sway how excellent!

Come one and all, undaunted men in blue,

A crisis, now, affairs are coming to!



(Enter POLICE, marching in single file)

SERGEANT: Though in body and in mind



POLICE: Tarantara! tarantara!



SERGEANT: We are timidly inclined,



POLICE: Tarantara!

[ From: http://www.elyrics.net]



SERGEANT: And anything but blind



POLICE: Tarantara! tarantara!



SERGEANT: To the danger that's behind,



POLICE: Tarantara!



SERGEANT: Yet, when the danger's near,



POLICE: Tarantara! tarantara!



SERGEANT

We manage to appear



POLICE

Tarantara!



SERGEANT

As insensible to fear

As anybody here,

As anybody here.



POLICE

Tarantara! tarantara!, etc.
