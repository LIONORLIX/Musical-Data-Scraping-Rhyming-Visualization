Oh, Better Far to Live and Die


King.

Oh, better far to live and die

Under the brave black flag I fly,

Than play a sanctimonious part,

With a pirate head and a pirate heart.

Away to the cheating world go you,

Where pirates all are well-to-do;

But I?ll be true to the song I sing,

And live and die a Pirate King.



For I am a Pirate King!

And it is, it is a glorious thing

To be a Pirate King!



For I am a Pirate King!

Chorus.

You are!

Hurrah for our Pirate King!

King.

And it is, it is a glorious thing

To be a Pirate King.

Chorus.

It is!

Hurrah for our Pirate King!

King & Chorus.

Hurrah for the/our Pirate King!



King. Darrell Fancourt as the Pirate King

1926



When I sally forth to seek my prey

I help myself in a royal way.

I sink a few more ships, it?s true,

Than a well-bred monarch ought to do;

But many a king on a first-class throne,

If he wants to call his crown his own,

Must manage somehow to get through

More dirty work than ever I do,



For I am a Pirate King!

And it is, it is a glorious thing

To be a Pirate King!



For I am a Pirate King!

Chorus.

You are!

Hurrah for the Pirate King!

King.

And it is, it is a glorious thing

To be a Pirate King.

Chorus.

It is!

Hurrah for our Pirate King!

King & Chorus.

Hurrah for the/our Pirate King!
