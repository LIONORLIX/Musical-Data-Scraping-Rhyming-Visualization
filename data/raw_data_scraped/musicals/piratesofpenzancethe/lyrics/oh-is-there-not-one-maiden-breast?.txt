Oh Is There Not One Maiden Breast?


(Fredrick)

Oh is there not one maiden breast,

Which does not feel the moral beauty.

Of making worldly interest,

Subordinate to sense of duty.



(Fredrick)

Who would not give up willing all matrimonial ambition?

To rescue such a one as I from his unfortunate position,

From his position.

To rescue such a one as I from his unfortunate position!



(Daughters)

Alas, there's not one maiden breast,

Which seems to feel the moral beauty.

Of making worldly interest,

Subordinate to sense of duty.



(Fredrick)

Oh is there not one maiden here

Whose homely face and bad complexion,

Have caused all hope to disappear

Of ever winning mans affection



(Fredrick)

To such a one if such there be

I swear by heavens arch above you

if you will cast your eyes on me

However plain you'll be I'll love you,

However plain you'll be.



(Fredrick)

If you will cast your eyes on me

However plain you'll be I'll love you,

I'll love you. I'll love, I'll lo-o-ove you.



(Chorus)

Alas there's not one maiden here

Whose homely face and bad complexion

has caused all hope to disappear

Of ever winning mans affection



(Fredrick)

Not one?



(Chorus)

No, no not one.



(Fredrick)

Not one?



(Chorus)

No, no.



(Mabel)

Yes, one!



(Chorus)

'Tis Mabel!



(Mabel)

'Tis Ma-a-a-bel!
