What Ought We to Do?


Edith:

What ought we to do

Gentle sisters say?

Propriety we know

Says we ought to stay



Kate:

While sympathy exclaims

Freedom from your tether

Play it on our gains

Leave them here together



Isabel:

Her case may any day

Be yours, my dear or mine

Let her make her hay

While the sun doth shine

Let us compromise,

Our hearts are not of leather

Let us shut our eyes

And talk about the weather



Girls:

Yes, yes let's talk about the weather
