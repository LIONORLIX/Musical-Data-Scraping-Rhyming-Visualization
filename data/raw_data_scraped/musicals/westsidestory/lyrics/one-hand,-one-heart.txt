TONY (Sings)

Make of our hands one hand,

Make of our hearts one heart,

Make of our vows one last vow:

Only death will part us now.



MARIA

Make of our lives one life,

Day after day, one life.



BOTH

Now it begins, now we start

One hand, one heart;

Even death won't part us now.



Make of our lives one life,

Day after day, one life.

Now it begins, now we start

One hand, one heart,

Even death won't part us now.
