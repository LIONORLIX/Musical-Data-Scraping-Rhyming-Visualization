Balcony Scene (Tonight)


MARIA:

Only you, you're the only thing I'll see forever.

In my eyes, in my words and in ev'rything I do,

Nothing else but you.

Ever!



TONY:

And there's nothing for me but Maria,

Ev'ry sight that I see is Maria.



MARIA:

Tony. Tony...



TONY:

Always you, ev'ry thought I'll ever know, MARIA:

Ev'rywhere I go, you'll be, you and me! All the world is only you and me!

(They kiss)

Tonight, tonight,

It all began tonight,

I saw you and the world went away.

Tonight, tonight,

There's only you tonight,

What you are, what you do, what you say.

Today, a1l day I had the feeling

A miracle would happen.

I know now I was right.

For here you are,

And what was just a world is a star

Tonight!



BOTH:

Tonight. tonight,

The world is full of light,

With suns and moons all over the place.

Tonight, tonight,

The world is wild and bright.

Going mad, shooting sparks into space.

Today the world was just an address.

A place for me to live in,

No better than all right,

But here you are

And what was just a world is a star

Tonight!

(They kiss. Maria goes inside.)



TONY:

Tonight! Tonight!

It all began tonight

I saw you and the world went away



MARIA (returning): I cannot stay. Go quickly!



TONY: I am not afraid!



MARIA: They are strict with me. Please!



TONY: I love you.



MARIA: Yes, yes, hurry. Go! (He climbs down.)

Buenas noches!



MARIA: Wait! When will! See you? (He starts back up.)



TONY: Tomorrow



MARIA: I work at the bridal shop. Come there.



TONY: At sundown



MARIA: Yes. Good night.



TONY: Good night (starts off)



MARIA: Tony!



TONY: Ssh!



MARIA: Come to the back door



TONY: Si.



MARIA: Tony! (He stops.) What does Tony stand for?



TONY: Anton.



MARIA: Te adoro. Anton...



TONY: Te adoro, Maria!



BOTH:

Good night, good night,

Sleep well and when you dream,

Dream of me...

Tonight!
