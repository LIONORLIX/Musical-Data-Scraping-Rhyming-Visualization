The One


Man#1:

How does it start?

How does it last?

It's a miracle

two people get together.



Woman#1:

How does your heart

choose who to cast

in a partner for the night or forever?



Man#2:

Every date you go on's like a chore.



Woman#2:

Can you trust your judgment when it's been so poor?



Man#1 & 2:

You've gotten burned



Woman#1 & 2:

Wish you could run



All 4:

But if you do

Then you'll never ever find the one

The one

Are you ever gonna find the one?





Man#1:

How will it go?



Woman#1:

Where will it lead?



Man#1 & Woman#1:

Will tonight become a lifetime full of magic?



Woman#2:

Go with the flow.



Man#2:

You might succeed.



Man#2 & Woman#2:

Meeting someone you don't think is fuckin tragic.



Woman#1:

Will the minutes feel like hours, even years?



Woman#2:

Or will you connect and share your deepest fears?



Man#1 & 2:

It's so damn hard

And so not fun



All 4:

Still you go on

in that endless search to find the one

The one

Are you ever gonna find the one?





Man#1 & Woman#1:

How do you stay optimistic

when there are so many ways to fail?



Man#2 & Woman#2:

Don't wanna be another statistic



All 4:

Who didn't get the fairy tale.



All 4 + Waiter:

Where the hell's this fairy tale?!



Men+Waiter(&Women):

Dating's a bitch

(It's a bitch!)

Dating's unfair

(It's so unfair!)



Waiter:

It's like a battle where you find out what you're made of



Man#1(& the rest):

Wish you could ditch

(Let's ditch!)

This cruel affair

(This affair)



Waiter:

The stakes are high and there's so much to be afraid of.



Woman#1:

When you're far from perfect, stuck in your own way

Woman#1 & #2:

All your baggage keeps your chance of love at bay.



All 4+Waiter:

And so until

The game is done



Waiter:

You hold out hope

that before you lose your mind

You'll meet your match

and won't end up left behind.



All 4+Waiter:

Maybe tonight is the night you're gonna find the one

(The one!)

The one

(The one!)

__Could tonight be when you find

The one?
