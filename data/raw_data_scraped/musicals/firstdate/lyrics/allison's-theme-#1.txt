Allison's Theme #1


Gabe: Aaron! Now is not the time to be thinking about Allison!

Allison: Guess he can't help himself, Gabe! I'm simply to wonderful!

You look buff

You've been working out, babe

All your hotness is making me weak

Love the haircut

I love the suit

You're a walking example of chic

You're the handsomest man in this restaurant

Like a model right out of GQ

You're also the world's greatest lover

So rip off my clothes

Spread my legs

Have your at with me

Oh, how I crave your...

Gabe:Bullshit!
