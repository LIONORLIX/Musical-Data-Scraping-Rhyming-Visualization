The Things I Never Said


AARON

It isn't easy to express what I feel inside

But that shouldn't come as a surprise to you



AARON& AARON'S MOM

Haven't been the perfect mom

but please know that I tried



I did the best I could

and that was the best that I could do



AARON'S MOM

Now I'm facing a future that's uncertain

I cannot say what lies ahead

I won't give up I'll face my fears

And fight back years of un-cried tears

And tell you all the things I never said



AARON

All of the hours spent at work, consumed with my career



AARON'S MOM

I wouldn't blame you if you thought I didn't care



AARON

Graduations that I missed, all the games I didn't cheer



AARON'S MOM

I never told you then, but how I wanted to be there



AARON&AARON'S MOM

As thoughts of the past run through my memory

The choices I've made, the life I've led



AARON'S MOM

An office on the highest floor, it meant so much

But you mean more



AARON&AARON'S MOM

That's one of many things I never said



AARON

SO much of my life I took for granted

Like tucking my children into bed



AARON'S MOM

My world was always spinning fast

Then in an instant years have past

and here I sit with so much left unsaid



AARON&AARON'S MOM

I've always lived a world apart

but through it all you were my heart

That's one of many things



AARON'S MOM

Of oh so many things



AARON

I never said
