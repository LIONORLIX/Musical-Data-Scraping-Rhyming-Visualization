First Impressions


CASEY [Spoken]

So, do you agree with Kevin?



AARON [Spoken]

About what?



CASEY [Spoken]

Am I really cute?



AARON [Spoken]

What? You can't just ask me that



CASEY [Spoken]

Why not?

You said you're an open book

So? Am I?



AARON

She's a little artsy

She's hip and cool

She's just like all those girls

That ignored me all through school

She's kinda indie and pretty hot

She's a lot like all the things that I am not

There's some Asian symbol

Tattooed on her wrist

She's got the kinda look that says

'Hello world, I'm pissed'

She's sorta hostile

Her guns are drawn

Is it weird or just screwed up

That I'm turned on?



But that's just the first impression

I could be totally wrong

It's only a first impression



And maybe she's

A stuffy and conservative

Way uptight girl who's still a virgin

Never goes past second base

Supressing every single urge

Until she marches down the aisle

And finally ties the knot

She could want a giant family

Be an opera devotee

Hell, even have a PhD

Yes, that's who she could be



CASEY [Spoken]

I'm waiting



AARON [Spoken]

Uhh, yes, you're very

Pleasant-looking



CASEY [Spoken]

Pleasant-looking



AARON [Spoken]

No! I mean, attractive

Desirable, stunningly beautiful

How 'bout the...

All of the above

And what adjectives would you use to describe me?



CASEY

He's a bit annoying

And over-dressed

He's got the kinda vibe that says

'Look at me, I'm stressed'



[Spoken]

Really, there are just so many adjectives

To choose from, I wouldn't even know where to start



[Sung]

Probably likes to cuddle

Long walks in the park

And if he likes sex bet it's only in the dark



But that's just the first impression

I could be totally wrong

It's only a first impression



And maybe he's a

Nasty, uninhibited, ferocious tiger in the sack

Who rides a Harley, hits the gym

And makes his money dealing crack

Two wealthy kids in private schools

Who treat him like a god

He could kick some ass just like Bruce Lee

Engage in online piracy

And not take any shit from me



Yes that's who he could



AARON

That's who she could



CASEY/AARON

That's who he/she could be



But that's just a first impression

I could be totally wrong

It's only a first impression

And though the impression is strong

It never can hurt to question

Though I doubt this will lead to romance



AARON

Sometimes the ones who seem great

Are a nightmare to date



CASEY

Either way I've been burned



CASEY/AARON

But the one thing I've learned

Is oftentimes first impressions



AARON

Are worth a second glance



CASEY

It's worth a second glance



CASEY/AARON

It's worth a second glance
