Safer


Casey:

I know that I have issues.

I face them, I swear.

Think I overcome them then turn - they're still there.



Wish that I was different.

I'd like to let go,

But when I try to change there's my past, saying no.



Maybe it's all cause of dad,

his new kids, his new wife.

Or why not just blame mom who's been nuts my whole life.....



When you felt so alone from the moment of birth

and you've struggled to find your own true sense of worth

When it seems that there's no one across this whole earth to depend upon, you carry on.



Just like you always do.

Cause it's Safer

to rely on you.

Oh, it's Safer to rely on you...





Seen a million movies all selling true love.

Fantasies I'm not sure that I'm worthy of

Caution to the wind, my heart's been on display

Still the end result is it's not gone my way



So when I date some new guy

who's a deadbeat or jerk

At least I'm not so crushed

when it all doesn't work.....



When you once, unafraid,

wore your heart on your sleeve

And the ones that you loved chose to just turn and leave

Every day it gets harder to somehow believe

You will survive, so you strive



Just to keep up your guard,

Cause it's Safer

to hold every card.

Oh, it's Safer to hold every card...



I feel out of control,

I feel safe on the ground.

I go building up walls,

yet I wish to be found



A true contradiction to which I am bound

As I keep on spinning around and around_

And I look at the people who've worked it all out

and I wonder why I'm still a bundle of doubt

and sometimes I wanna just stand up and shout



Just commit and deal with it

Before your life flies by...

Don't let your life fly by.....



But is it Safer?

Maybe it's Safer,

if I don't try.......
