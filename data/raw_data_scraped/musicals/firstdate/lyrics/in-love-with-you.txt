In Love With You


AARON

I never knew what love was like

Until I saw your face

And suddenly I felt a love

That time could not erase



Your eyes so sweet and piercing

Your manner kind yet strong

The kind of girl I could love forever

We'd spend the rest of our lives together

And in my life I don't think I've ever

Been so fucking wrong



You're a bitch with no heart

You're a lier, you are Satan

And I hate the way you snore at night

All your quirks piss me off

And I don't think I'm mistaking

Your compulsive need to

Always be right



You're bossy and judgmental

Kind of tactless, boring too

And I really can't believe I ever

Fell in love with you



Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh



I know that all seemed kind of harsh

And things weren't always bad

In fact I think some times we shared

Were the best that I've ever had



Like our road trip that one summer

Or those steamy nights in Spain

You always melted

When I would praise you

And My stupid jokes

They would never phase you



That don't mean shit

Next to all the ways you

Drove Me So Insane



You're a cock-frickin' tease

Girl, you never stop you're talking

At sometimes you've got a double chin

You may say it's good fun

But your racist rants are shocking

And your lips don't need more collagen



All you care about is how much someone

Makes and what they do

Not a man in his right mind would ever

Fall in love with you



You always criticized the

Clothes that I would wear

And found a way of pointing out

My thinning hair

really nice

You turned me vegan

Which I totally despise

And I'm pretty sure you laughed

That time I said

Lets Compromise



If you were shot, or beaten

Or run over by a truck

I guess that I'd be sad

But then again...

It wouldn't suck

It wouldn't suck



So goodbye. Hit the road

As a girlfriend you are fired

Find another chump that you can fleece

Years from now, when you're old

And you finally expired,

Girl I hope that you don't rest in peace



Never met someone so selfish

Half the time, my balls were blue



After all that I've endured now

You can safely rest assured now

That your ex is up and cured now



Yes I'm so done being in love

In love with you

Whoa, we're through

Yeah, yeah, whoa



Yes we're done, Allison

Honeybun, it's like over

It was on, and now we're gone

And I've regained my composure

So God Bless, you're a mess

And that's what you call closure



So done being in love with you!
