Bailout Song #3


[CASEY'S VOICEMAIL]

Hey, it's Casey

Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah



REGGIE

This is your bailout

Sweetie, your bailout

Honey, I'm callin' to bail you out

And you still aren't answering

Your phone, now I'm pissed

I mean really



[Spoken]

Wait, hold on

Stop the music!

I said stop the music!

I don't wanna sing anymore!

Shit!



Okay, seriously, bitch?

What's the deal?

'Cause this is like my third

Unreturned phone call tonight

Which has never happened before

And it's really starting to make me

Feel desperate

And Reggie doesn't do desperate

Correct me if I'm wrong

But did we not agree

The night that we met doing karaoke

And, and bonding over 'Love is a Battlefield'

That we would be best friends forever?!

Well I'm fairly certain BFF's pick up the phone

When the other one calls, right?!

I mean, what is going on here?

One date and you're already

Dumping me for this guy?

Could it really be going that well?

Or did he just, like, shove you

In the back of his creepy white van

And now your phone's lying in a ditch

At the side of the road somewhere!



You're not dead, are you?

Oh my god, you're totally dead!

And he's, he's, he's, he--

Oh! Oh! He's making a dress out of your skin

At this very moment

And you're never even gonna get this voicemail!

That's it, Case

I'm comin' to the rescue!

Later, skank!
