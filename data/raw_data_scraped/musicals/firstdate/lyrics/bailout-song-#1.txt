Bailout Song #1


CASEY'S VOICE

Hey, it's Casey. Blah blah blah blah blah...



REGGIE

This is your bailout, sweetie

Your bailout, honey

I'm callin' to bail you out

You could tell him your dad's

In the hospital

Your building's on fire

That's all you need to say

And you're free and on your way!



It's your bestie calling

It's Reggie to the rescue

Here to save you from another

Catastrophic blind date

I've done it time and again

Saved you from horrendous men

All those losers who should never be

Allowed to pro-create

Like that dentist with the foul breath

That made you wanna yack

Or that hippie with the hair

Growing only on his back

Or that guy obsessed with Disney

Second thought, I'll cut him slack

(Though his love of princesses was rather suspect!)

But I'm digressing, I'm obsessing

You did not pick up your cell

Which means you either didn't

Hear it ring

Or things are going well

So e-mail, call, or Facebook

Tell me if you like this guy

Okay that's it, I love you lots

Need you forever - bye!



This is your bailout, sweetie

Your bailout, honey

I'm callin' to bail you out

You could tell him your grandma

Broke her hip

Or your dog ate some chocolate

That's all you need to say

And you're free and on your way!

Later, bitch
