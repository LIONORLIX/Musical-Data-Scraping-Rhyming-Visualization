There'll Be Some Changes Made


For there's a change in the weather

There's a change in the sea

So from now on there'll be a change in me

My walk will be diff'rent my talk and my name

Nothin' about me is goin' to be the same,

I'm goin' to change my way of livin' if that ain't enough,

Then I'll change the way that I strut my stuff,

'cause nobody wants you when you're old and gray

Ther'll be some change made.

So from now on there'll be a change in me

My walk will be diff'rent my talk and my name

Nothin' about me is goin' to be the same,

I'm goin' to change my long, tall Mamma(Daddy) for a little short Fat,

Goin' to change the number where I live at.

'cause nobody wants you when you're old and gray

There'll be some changes made.
