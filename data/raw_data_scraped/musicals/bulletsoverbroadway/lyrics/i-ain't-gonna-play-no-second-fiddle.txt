I Ain't Gonna Play No Second Fiddle


Let me tell you daddy,

Mama ain't gonna sit in and grieve,

Pack up your stuff

And get ready to leave.





I stood your foolishness long enough,

So now I'm gonna call your bluff,

On certain things I'm gonna call your hand,

So now daddy, here's my plan;





I ain't gonna play no second fiddle,

I'm used to playin' lead.

You must think that I am blind,

You've been cheatin' me all the time!





Why did you still flirt,

And you notice I is hurt?

You see you with my chum,

Do you think that I am dumb?





You cause me to drink,

When I sat down and think,

And see that you never take heed!





I called to your house the other night,

Caught you and your good girl havin' a fight!

I ain't gonna play no second fiddle,

'Cause I'm used to playin' lead.





I caught you with your good time vamp,

So now papa I'm gonna put out your lamp!

And papa, I ain't sore,

You ain't gonna mess with me no more!





I'm gonna flirt with another sheik,

And you're gonna hang your head and weep!

I ain't gonna play no second fiddle,

'Cause I'm used to playin' lead.
