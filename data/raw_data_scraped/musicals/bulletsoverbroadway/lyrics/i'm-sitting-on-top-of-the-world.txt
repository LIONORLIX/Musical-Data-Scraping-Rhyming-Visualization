I'm Sitting on Top of the World


I'm sitting on top of the world,

Just rolling along

Just rolling along

I'm quitting the blues of the world

Just singing a song

Just singing a song

Glory hallelujah, i just phoned the parson

Hey, par, get ready to call

Just like humpty dumpty,

I'm going to fall

I'm sitting on top of the world

Just rolling along

Just rolling along

Some people have diamonds

And beautiful pearls

While others have children

Just kiddies with curls

Keep all of your fortunes

Keep all of your fame

I just found a sweetie

Who's changing her name

I'm sitting on top of the world

Just rolling along

Just rolling along

I'm quitting the blues of the world

Just singing a song

Just singing a song

Glory hallelujah, i just phoned the parson

Hey, par, get ready to call

Just like humpty dumpty,

I'm going to fall

I'm sitting on top of the world

Just rolling along

Just rolling along

Don't want any millions

I'm getting my share

I've only got one suit (one suit)

That's all i can wear

A bundle of money won't make you feel gay

A sweet little honey is making me say

I'm sitting on top of the world

Just rolling along

Just rolling along

I'm quitting the blues of the world

Just singing a song

Just singing a song

Glory hallelujah, i just phoned the parson

Hey, par, get ready to call

Just like humpty dumpty,

I'm going to fall

I'm sitting on top of the world

Just rolling along

Just rolling along
