Let's Misbehave


We're all alone; no chaperone can get our number...

The world's in slumber; let's misbehave.



There's something wild about you, child, that's so contangious...

Let's be outrageous; let's misbehave.



When Adam won Eve's hand, he wouldn't stand for teasin'...

He didn't care about those apples out of season.



They say the spring means just one thing to little love birds.

We're not above birds; let's misbehave.



(Chorus)



If you'd be just so sweet and only meet your fate, dear,

It would be the great event of nineteen twenty-eight, dear.



(Chorus)



Let's Misbehave!
