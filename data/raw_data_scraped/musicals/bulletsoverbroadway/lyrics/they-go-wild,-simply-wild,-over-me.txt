They Go Wild, Simply Wild, Over Me


I hate to talk about myself,

But here's one time I must!

Your confidence I'll trust,

I have to speak or bust!



It's funny how I get the girls,

I never try at all;

I seem to hypnotise them,

I'm bound to make them fall!



They go wild, simply wild, over me!

They go mad, just as mad as they can be!

No matter where I'm at,

All the ladies, thin or fat,

The tall ones,

The small ones,

I grab them off like that!



Every night, how they fight over me!

I don't know what it is that they can see!

The ladies look at me and sigh,

In my arms they wanna die!

They go wild, simply wild, over me!



I get so many pretty girls,

I give a few away!

They bother me each day,

They're leading me astray!



There's lots of fellows go with girls

And never get their drift;

I always get the women,

It's just a natural gift!



They go wild, simply wild, over me!

They go mad, just as mad as they can be!

No matter where I'm at,

All the ladies, thin or fat,

The tall ones,

The small ones,

Why, I grab them off like that!



Every night, how they fight over me!

I don't know what it is that they can see!

I can never be alone,

I have to choke the telephone!

They go wild, simply wild, over me!
