There's a New Day Comin'!


New Day's coming,

As sure as you're born,

There's a new day coming,

start tooting your horn!



See that new day dawning,

let's all knock on wood,

Never say "Good morning",

It's BOUND to be good!



New world singing,

It's going to be fine,

New clothes swinging

on everyone's line,

Joy bells ringing,

For your folks and mine,

There's a new day coming soon!
