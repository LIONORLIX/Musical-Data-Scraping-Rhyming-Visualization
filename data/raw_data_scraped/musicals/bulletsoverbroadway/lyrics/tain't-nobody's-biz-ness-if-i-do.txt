Tain't Nobody's Biz-ness If I Do


There ain't nothing I can do or nothing I can say

That folks don't criticize me

But I'm goin' to do just as I want to anyway

And don't care if they all despise me

If I should take a notion

To jump into the ocean

'T ain't nobody's bizness if I do, do, do, do

If I go to church on Sunday

Then just sing the shimmy down on Monday

Ain't nobody's bizness if I do, if I do

If my friend ain't got no money

And I say, "take all mine, honey"

'T ain't nobody's bizness if I do, do, do, do

If I give him my last nickel

And it leaves me in a pickle

'T ain't nobody's bizness if I do, if I do

I'd rather my man would hit me

Than to jump up right and quit me

'T ain't nobody's bizness if I do, do, do, do

I swear I won't call no copper

If I'm beat up by my poppa

If I'm beat up by my poppa

'T ain't nobody's bizness if I do, if I do
