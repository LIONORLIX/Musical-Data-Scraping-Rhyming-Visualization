Blues My Naughty Sweetie Gives to Me


There are blues that you get from worry.

There are blues that you get from pain.

And there are blues when you're lonely



For your one and only.

The blues you can never explain.



There are blues that you get from longing.

But the bluest blues that be.

Are the sort of blues that's on my mind,



They're the very meanest kind.

The blues my naughty sweetie gives to me.
