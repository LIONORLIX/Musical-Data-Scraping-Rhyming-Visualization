Billy-A-Dick


Every night while I'm undressin'

Sayin' my prayers and lightly confessin'

I can hear hot licks

From a set of drums upstairs



Well, it couldn't be Johnny 'cause he isn't there

Johnny's overseas, we no not where

But, believe it or not, every night on the dot

I can hear a tenor drum say



Billy-a-dick, Billy-a-dick, tick, tack

When's that character comin' back?

When's that kid in the G.I. lid

Gonna choo-choo down the track?



Poor ol' me, I'm beat as can be

And my rim has even started to rust

Look at these sticks tryin' to take out the licks

They're covered with an inch of dust, beep-a-dust



Billy-a-dick, Billy-a-dick, tick, tack

When's that character comin' back?

When's that boy with the jumpin' joy

Gonna launch that last attack?



If he'll roll, roll, roll like a drumstick

Chewin', chewin', chewin' on a gumstick

Jack, we'll soon have a Japanese derby

And beat it like a cymbal on a music rack



Billy-a-dick, Billy-a-dick, tick, tack

When's that character comin' back?

When's that boy with the jumpin' joy

Gonna launch that last attack?



If he'll roll, roll, roll like a drumstick

Chewin', chewin', chewin' on a gumstick

Jack, we'll soon have a Japanese derby

And beat it like a cymbal on a music rack



Billy-a-dick, Billy-a-dick, tick, tack

Billy-a-dick, Billy-a-dick, tick, tack

Billy-a-dick, Billy-a-dick, tick, tack

When's that character comin' back, Mom?
