Kitchen Mechanics' Night Out


In a very exclusive kitchen,

At an address on Park Avenue

As she scoured and stacked the dishes,

a certain maid was feeling blue.



Every night as he cooked the dinner,

for a family that was not his own,

A ballroom up in Harlem,

Was where their minds would roam.



But one night a week at 7,

they could throw off their drab couture,

cuz on Thursdays at they Savoy,

They could be who they really were.



Put down that frying pan,

and take me by the hand.

Girl we gonna get a night to jump and shout

Kitchen Mechanic's night out!



It's going to be alright,

we get to swing tonight,

we'll be cheek to cheek and baby don't you pout

Kitchen Mechanic's night out!



A Thursday Cinderella,

gardenia in her hair,

add one prince charming fella,

her Harlem Fred Astaire.



Just grab yourself a bow,

cuz you don't need no dough,

ladies night to lindy and it's all about

Kitchen Mechanic's night out!



(instrumentals)



It's time that they all knew,

the floor belongs to you,

ladies night to lindy and it's all about

Kitchen Mechanic's night out!



Kitchen Mechanic's Night....
