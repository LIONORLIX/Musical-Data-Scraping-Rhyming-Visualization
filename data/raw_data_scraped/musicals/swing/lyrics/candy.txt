Candy

I call my sugar Candy

Because I'm sweet on Candy

and Candy's sweet on me



She understands me

My understanding Candy

And Candy's always handy

When I need sympathy



You wish that there were four of her

So I could love much more of her

She has taken your complete heart

Got a sweet tooth for my sweetheart



Candy

It's gonna be just dandy

The day I take my Candy

And make her mine, all mine



Candy

I call my sugar Candy

Because I'm sweet, so sweet on Candy

And Candy's sweet on me



You wish that there were four of him

Oh how I could love much more of him

He has taken your complete heart

You got a sweet tooth for your sweetheart



Candy

It's gonna be just dandy

The day I take my candy

Gee how the sun will shine



On the day my Candy

On the day my Candy

On the day my Candy's mine
