Opus One


Oh! baby, I'm rackin' my brain, to think of a name

To give to this tune, so Perry can croon

And maybe old Bing will give it a fling

And that'll start everyone hummin' the thing



The melody's dumb, repeat and repeat

But if you can swing, it's got a good beat

And that's the main thing, to make it complete

'Cause everyone's swingin' today



So we call it Opus One, it's not for Sammy Kaye, hey,

Hey, hey

Opus One, it's got to swing, not sway, baby



If Mr. Les Brown can make it renowned

And Ray Anthony could rock it for me

There's never a doubt, you'll knock yourself out

Whenever you get near Opus One
