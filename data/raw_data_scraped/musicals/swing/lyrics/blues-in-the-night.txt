Blues in the Night


My mama done tol' me when I was in pigtails

My mama done tol' me, "Son

A man'll sweet talk and give ya the big eye

But when the sweet talkin's done



A man's a two-face

A worrisome thing who'll leave ya to sing

The blues in the night"



Now the rain's a-fallin'

Hear the train's a callin', whooee

My mama done tol' me

Hear dat lonesome whistle

Blowin' 'cross the trestle, whooee!



My mama done tol' me, a-whooee-ah-whooee

Ol' clickety-clack's a-echoin'

Back th' blues in the night

The evenin' breeze'll start the trees to cryin'

And the moon'll hide it's light

When you get the blues in the night



Take my word, the mockingbird'll sing

The saddest kind o' song

He knows things are wrong

And he's right



From Natchez to Mobile, from Memphis to St. Joe

Wherever the four winds blow

I been in some big towns an' heard me some big talk

But there is one thing I know



A man's a two-face

A worrisome thing who'll leave ya to sing

The blues in the night



The evenin' breeze'll start the trees to cryin'

And the moon'll hide it's light

When you get the blues

Blues in the night



Take my word, the mockingbird'll sing

The saddest kind o' song

He knows things are wrong

And he's right



From Natchez to Mobile, from Memphis to St. Joe

Wherever the four winds blow, winds blow

I been in some big towns an' heard me some big talk

But there is one thing I know



A man's a two-face

A worrisome thing who'll leave ya to sing

The blues in the night

Yes, babe, only, only blues in the night
