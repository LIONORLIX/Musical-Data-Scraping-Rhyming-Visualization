Funeral: There Is a Fountain/It Don't Make Sense


MOURNERS

There is a fountain filled with blood

Drawn from Immanuel's veins

And sinners plunged beneath that flood

Lose all their guilty stains,

Lose all their guilty stains,

Lose all their guilty stains,

And sinners plunged beneath that flood

Lose all their guilty stains.



CRAIG

The simple white coffin was carried by three of Mary's cousins and three of her young friends.



MOURNERS

The dying thief rejoiced to see

That fountain in his day.

And there may I, though vile as he,

Wash all my sins away.



CRAIG (overlapping)

Several more friends volunteered to serve as pall-bearers,

but they were deemed too small to shoulder the burden.

Recent heavy rains made the North Georgia red clay soil glow,

as Mary Phagan, just two months shy of fourteen, was laid to her final rest.



FRANKIE

God forgive me what I think.

God forgive me what I wish right now.



CRAIG

Well, you must've known Mary pretty well.



FRANKIE

Yessir, I did.



CRAIG

Then this must be a mighty hard day for you.



FRANKIE

Did you ever hear her laugh?

When she laughed, you swore you'd never cry again.

Did you ever see her smile?

Her smile was like a glass of lemonade.

And she said funny things,

And she wore pretty dresses,

And she liked to see the pictures at the VFW Hall,

And she loved ridin' swings,

And she liked cotton candy,

But I think she liked the pictures best of all:



No, it don't make sense to me

That she won't be around.

No, it don't make sense to me

To put her in the cold and lonely ground.

And no, it don't make sense

The way the world can let you fall---

I swear if don't make sense to me at all.



MOURNERS

Dear dying Lamb,

Thy precious blood

Shall never lose its pow'r:



GIRL

She had two crooked teeth:



KID

She had cuts on her fingers:



SECOND GIRL

She worked next to me last summer:



THIRD GIRL

Once a week we used to play:



SECOND GIRL

And she knew how to read:



GIRL

She would smile at the foreman:



CHILDREN

And I can't believe they took my friend away:



MOURNERS & CHILDREN

|No, it don't make sense to me|

That she will not be there|No, it don't make sense to me.



FRANKIE

|When she laughed, you swore you'd never cry again.



A MOTHER

She loved when I tied ribbons in her hair:



ALL

And no, it don't make sense,

They way the sun can still burn down.

No, it don't make sense to me:



FRANKIE

God forgive me what I think.



CRAIG

Tell me, son, you got any idea who it was?



FRANKIE

God forgive me what I wish right now.

I don't know the coward's name.

I don't know the bastard's face.

But I swear right now to God:

He ain't never gonna get away with what he done to Mary!

Let him quiver in his boots!

Let him run until he bleeds!

I won't rest until I know

Hes's burning in the ragin' fires of Hell forevermore!



MOURNERS

There is a fountain filled with blood

Drawn from Immanuel's veins:



FRANKIE

God forgive me what I think.

God forgive me what I wish right now:



MOURNERS (overlapping)

And sinners plunged beneath that flood

Lose all their guilty stains.
