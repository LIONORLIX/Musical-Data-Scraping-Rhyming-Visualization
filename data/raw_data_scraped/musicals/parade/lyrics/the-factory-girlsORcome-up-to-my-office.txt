The Factory Girls/Come up to My Office


DORSEY:

Iola Stover, will you discribe for the court Mr.

Leo Franks manner in the factory?



IOLA:

He'll call my name

I'll turn my head

He got no words to say

His eyes get big

My face gets red

And I want to run away



I'll feel his breath

Back of my neck

His hand against my chair

I'll punch the clock

Pick up my check

It seems like he's always there



ESSIE&MONTEEN:

He'll call my name

I'll turn my head

He got no words to day

His eyes get big

My face get red

And I want to run away



IOLA&ESSIE:

I'm in the hall

And then he's there

He passes much too close

I change my clothes

Put up my hair



MONTEEN:

I'm in the lounge

I turn around

He passes much too close

I eat my lunch

I hear a sound



IOLA,ESSIE&MONTEEN:

And somehow I'm sure he knows

And I turn

And he smiles

And he says



LEO:

Why don'tcha come up to my office?

Got a couple o' things you might like to see

Why don'tcha come up to my office?

'Bout two-fiffteen 'til a quarter to three

If you could maybe swing by honey

Well, you know it'd be okay with me

If you came, if you came, if you came

If you came to my office



Why don'tcha come up to my office?

I got a bottle o' wine and the cork ain't popped!

Why don'tcha come up to my office?

Where it's nice and cool when the blinds are dropped

If you could maybe swing by honey

We'll pretend that bad ol' clock has stopped

If you came, if you came, if you came

If you came to my office



I know this new dance that they're doin' in Manhattan

I'll get you dancin' like you've never done before

And I'll give you things that they sent me from Manhattan

And if you like, well, I got more

Hell I got more



Come on and come up to my office

I got a fine fried chicken with biscuits for two

Come on and come up to my office

We got lots of things that we both can do

Just take a break and swing by, honey

No one has to know but me and you

That you came, that you came, that you came, that you came

When you came, when you came, when you came,

when you came

If you came, if you came, if you came, if you came

So Come on! Come on!

Why don'tcha come up and come on and come up to my

Why don'tcha come up and come on and come up to my

Why don'tcha come up and come on and come up to my

Come on and come up

Come on and come up

Come on and come up

Come up and come on



IOLA,ESSIE&MONTEEN:

He calls my name

I turn my head

He got no words to say

His eyes get big

My face gets red

And I want to run away

And he looks

And I wait

And he smiles
