Summation and Cakewalk


DORSEY

This angel met her end on the concrete floor of the sweatshop

where she toiled away her childhood fastening erasers to pencil caps

for ten pennies an hour.

She died a noble death without a splotch or blemish upon her

(holding up her bloody clothes above his head)



Your Honor, I've done my duty;

I have no apologies to make.

There will be but one verdict in this trial:

GUILTY! GUILTY!

GUILTY!



ENSEMBLE (overlapping)

God bless this day in the old hills of Georgia

The old red hills of home.

All sinners pay in the old hills of Georgia

Let us finish what's begun

And let Jesus' will be done!



JUDGE ROAN

Gentlemen of the Jury, have you reached a verdict?



FOREMAN

Yes, sir, we have, Your Honor.



JUDGE ROAN

How say you?



FOREMAN

Guilty.



(The eleven other jurors confirm their verdict: GUILTY!

The crowd breaks into an exultant celebratory cakewalk.

Leo and Lucille embrace each other, terrified.)
