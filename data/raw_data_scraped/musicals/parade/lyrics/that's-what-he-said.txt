That's What He Said


DORSEY

Bring in Jim Conley!



CROWD (variously)

Lemme see! Watch out!

What's he gonna say?

Who's Jim:Jim Conley?

Why they gonna call that man?

Wait a minute!

Lord, 'nother nigger:

Watch out!

Looka this!

What's he gonna say about:?

What's he gonna say?

What's he gonna say?

Oh!

Watch out! Look! Jimmy!

Will ya looka that?

Now wait a minute!

He's no good - No damn good:

Puttin' on airs!

Slick as an onion!

Who's this?

What's he gonna do?

What's he doin'?

He's askin' him a question!

What's he gonna say?

What's he gonna say?



CONLEY

He tol' me to watch the door,

"Watch the door" - that's what he said.

That's what he said - I should make sure

No one came and interrupted.

Well, I'd say once or twice a month,

He'd tell me, "Jim you watch the door -

I got a lady comin'.

I got a lady comin':"

Like I said, once or twice a month,

There'd be a lady come to call

And he'd say, "Jim, you watch the door,"

That's what he said.

And once, I remember there were two ladies.

Another time, there was this young black gentleman from Chicago:



ROSSER

Objection!



DORSEY

All right, then, Jim, will you tell us about the mornin' of April 26th?



CONLEY

The day of the parade?

He tol' me to watch the door.

"Watch the door," that's what he said.

That's what he said, "I got a girl,

She'll be comin' up to see me,

She's a very pretty girl:"

He said, "Don't let me catch you lookin' at

Miss Mary Perkins."

That's what he called her, I think, uh-huh,

"Miss Mary Perkins."

So when this Mary came to call

I kep' my eyes down to the floor

'Cause Mr. Frank said not to look,

That's what he said.



Next thing, I hear Mr. Frank is yellin' somethin',

so I run upstairs, and I opens the door, and Mr. Frank looks up.



He said, "We were playin' a game!

Playin' a game!" That's what he said -

That's what he said, and little Mary's

Kinda crumpled in the corner.

He said, "You don't understand -

She didn't want to play the game,

And so I went and hit her -

You see, I had to hit her."

He told me I should go and look,

He said she's actin' like she's sick,

And I said, "Lawd, that chil' is dead!"

That's what I said!



And he said, "No! No!

It ain't my fault that girl is dead!"

He said, "No! No!"

That's what he said.

CONLEY (CROWD in brackets)

(That's what he said!)

He said, "No! No!"

And his eyes were wild and his face was red,

He said, "No!" (No!)

"No!" (No!)

That's what he said!

(That's what he said, that's what he

What he said, he said that's,

That's what he said:)

He said, "Gotta get her out -

Let's get her out!" That's what he said. (That's what he said)

And so I found me

This ol' gunny sack and wrapped 'er.

He said, "You're a good boy, Jim -

I know you won't tell no one nothin' -

Here's a hundred dollars!"

(No! It can't be true!)

I got a hundred dollars.

(God! What can we do?)

And so I put her on my back

We took the elevator down.

He said, "Jus' throw her on the ground!"

That's what he said.

(That's what he said.)

Yes, he said

"No!" (No!)

"No!" (No!)

"There ain't no reason I should hang!"

He said, "No!" (No!)

"No!" (No!)

That's what he said!

(That's what he said!)

He said, "No!" (No!)

"No!" (No!)

"There ain't no reason I should hang -

You got money in your pocket and there's plenty more o' that -

I got wealthy friends an' fam'ly, and a wife who's dumb and fat -

I got rich folks out in Brooklyn if I need somewheres to go

And these stupid rednecks never gonna know!"

(Hang 'im!)

"No!"

(Hang 'im!)

"It ain't my fault that girl is dead!" (Hang the Jew!)

He said, "No!" (Hang 'im!)

"No!" (Hang 'im!)

That's what he said! (Make 'im pay!)

He said, "No!" (Get 'im!)

"No!" (Now!)

And his eyes were wild and his face was red

He said, "No!" (Hang 'im!)

(Hang 'im!)
