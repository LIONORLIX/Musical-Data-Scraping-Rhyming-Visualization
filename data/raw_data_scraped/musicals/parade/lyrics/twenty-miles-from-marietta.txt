Twenty Miles from Marietta


DORSEY:

There is a farmhouse in Marietta

Kinda bettered and forlorn

And in that farmhouse, fourteen years ago

A girl named Mary was born



And she would dance in fields of cotton

There was a tree where she could play

But when her daddy died two years ago

Mary and her momma moved away



It's only twenty miles from Marietta

To a fact'ry in the center of this town

And twenty miles was all it took

To strike that sweet girl down



People of Atlanta fought for freedom to their graves

But now their ciry is a fact'ry and their children are it's slaves

People of Atlanta swing their city gate's wide

And look at what you've wrought
