A Rumblin' and a Rollin'


RILEY

You hear a rumblin' and a rollin'?

It's comin' down from the North.

It's comin' up through the ground,

And it's a funny ol' sound,

'Cause it's a rumblin' and a rollin'!



ANGELA

And I bet I know why -

See 'em on the train,

See 'em on the bus -

They never cared much about folks like us!



RILEY

But now they're gonna pay attention.

Sure they gonna ask, "Why? Why? Why?"



ANGELA

They gonna say, "I don't know what,

I don't know how!"



BOTH

Well, they are gonna find out now.

They're gonna pay attention.



RILEY

They gonna yell, "Set that man free!"



NEWT LEE

Well, they sure ain't talkin' 'bout me.



ALL THREE

Now there's a rumblin' and a rollin'

Here come the Yankee Brigade!



NEWT LEE

They gonna come through this town -

We better keep our heads down:



RILEY AND NEWT LEE

We better start mumblin' and shufflin':



ALL THREE

We better polish our smiles.



CONLEY

Old Black Joe at your service,

Won't do nothin' that'll make you nervous.

Won't do nothin' worth a look or a mention



ALL FOUR

And they won't never pay attention!



CONLEY

They never say, "My! My! My!"



RILEY

They gonna say, "Bring me my boots!"



ANGELA

"Bring me my tea!"



NEWT LEE

I betcha thought the slaves were free:



ANGELA

Mister Frank, good for you.

Lotta folks comin' to get you through.

Mister Frank, ain't that grand?

Lotta folks comin' to take a stand.

Mister Frank, knock on wood.

It ain't gonna do you no goddamn good!



CONLEY

I can tell you this, as a matter of fact,

That the local hotels wouldn't be so packed

If a little black girl had gotten attacked.



NEWT LEE, RILEY AND ANGELA

Go on, go on, go on, go on:



RILEY

They're comin', they're comin' now, yessirree!



NEWT LEE

'Cause a white man gonna get hung, you see.



CONLEY, RILEY AND NEWT LEE

There's a black man swingin' in ev'ry tree



ALL FOUR

But they don't never pay attention!



ANGELA

Oh, no:



CONLEY

Hell:



ALL FOUR

They never say, "Why? Why? Why?"



RILEY

But if a Yankee boy flies:



CONLEY

Surprise!



ANGELA AND CONLEY

Surprise!



NEWT LEE

Surprise!



ALL FOUR

They gonna pay attention!

They gonna yell "Set that man free!"



CONLEY (singing a snatch of "Camptown Races" as he goes back to his nap)

Dee dee dee dee dee dee dee:



NEWT LEE, RILEY AND ANGELA

Oh, there'll be a rumblin' and a rollin', yeah:

There'll be a rumblin' and a rollin', yeah
