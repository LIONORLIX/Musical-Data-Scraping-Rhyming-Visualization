Frankie's Testimony


DORSEY:

So, Frankie,

You say you rode downtown with Mary on the English Avenue streetcar?



FRANKIE: Yes, sir. Mornin' of the Memorial Day Parade



DORSEY: And can you tell us what happened?



FRANKIE:

Well, she got up to go and she looked kinda funny.

And I said.... Somethin' wrong Mary?



MARY: Mr. Frank.



FRANKIE: Mr. Frank what?



MARY: Looks at me.



FRANKIE: Looks at you? Everybody looks at you!



MARY: Not like Mr. Frank.



FRANKIE: What's he do?



MARY:

He calls my name

I turn my head

He got no words to say

His eyes get big

My face gets red

And I want to run away

And he looks

And I wait

And he smiles...
