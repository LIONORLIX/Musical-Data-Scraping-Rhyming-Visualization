All the Wasted Time


LEO

I will never understand

What I did to deserve you,

Or how to be the man

That I'm supposed to be.

I will never understand

If I live a thousand lifetimes

Why you did the things you did for me.

Just look at you -

How could I not be in love with you?

What kind of fool could have taken you

For granted for so long?

All the wasted time,

All the million hours,

Pushing you away,

Building up my walls;

All the days gone by

To glare, to pout, to push you out,

And I never knew anything at all

I never knew anything at all.



LUCILLE

I will never understand

How all the world misjudged you

When I have always known

How lucky I must be.

I will never understand

How I kept from going crazy

Just waiting there till you came home to me.

Now look at me

Now that you're finally here with me -

Now that I know I was right to wait

And everyone else was so wrong

For so long

All the wasted time



LEO

All the wasted time



LUCILLE

All the million hours.

Years on top of years

Still too proud to crawl -

All the days gone by

To feel that I don't satisfy

And I never knew anything at all

I never knew anything at all



LEO

All the wasted time



LUCILLE

All the wasted time



LEO

All the million hours.



BOTH

Leaves too high to touch,

Roots too strong to fall.

All the days gone by

To never show I loved you so

And I never knew anything at all.



LEO

I never knew anything

At all
