My wife she's-a What other wish

Love me now, Can I wish,

My wife she's-a What other plan

Love me now, Can I plan,

My wife's she's-a What other dream

Fall in love wit' me Can I dream!

And what for?

Whatever for?



When my heart is so full of you

So full of you



He's got no room There's no room



No room in my heart

For anything more.



Most happy, most happy, most happy man

In the whole Napa Valley

In the whole Napa Valley

The most happy, most happy, happy, happy, happy,

Happy man!



'At's-a me!
