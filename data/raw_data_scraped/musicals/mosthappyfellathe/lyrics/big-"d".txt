Big "D"


Ev'nin', ma'am.



Would you mind sayin' that again?



I said, 'Ev'nin', ma'am.



Ev'nin', ma'am'!

Mister, you've got a way of sayin'

Ev'nin', ma'am

That puts me in a friendly state of mind.



Would you mind sayin' that again

I mean 'friendly state'.



Friendly state.



Sister you've got a way of saying

'Friendly state

'That gives me the impression

You're my kind.



Would you mind sayin' 'crazy crystal'.



'Crazy crystal!'

would you mind saying 'nieman marcus'.



'Nieman marcus'.



Wait a minute!

Wait a minute!



You're from Big D

I can guess

By the way you draw!

And the way you dress

You're from Big D



My, oh Yes

I mean Big D little a, double l-a-s

And that spell Dallas

My darlin', darlin' Dallas



Don't it give you pleasure to confess

That you're from Big D



My, oh Yes

I mean Big D, little a double l-a

Big D, little a double l-a

Big D, little a double l-a-s

And that spell Dallas

Where ev'ry home's a palace



Cause the settlers settle for no less

Hooray for Big D



My, oh Yes

I mean Big D, little a double l-a

Big D, little a double l-a

Big D, little a double l-a-s



You're from Big D

I can guess

By the way you draw!

And the way you dress

You're from Big D



My, oh Yes

I mean Big D little a, double l-a-s

And there's oil all over your address

Back home in Big D



My, oh Yes

I mean Big D, little a double l-a

Big D, little a double l-a

Big D, little a double l-a-s

And that spells Dallas

I mean it with no malice



But the rest of Texas looks a mess

When you're from Big D



My, oh Yes

I mean Big D, little a double l-a

Big D, little a double l-a

Big D, little a double l-a-s



Big D, Big D

Talkin' 'bout big D, big D



Oil! Oil! Oil! Cattle! Cattle! Cattle!

My, oh Dallas, Dallas, Dallas, Dallas!

Big D! Little A double L-A-S!



And that spells Dallas

My darlin', darlin' Dallas

Don't it give you pleasure to confess

That you're from big D

My, oh yes

I mean

Big D

Little A, Double L-A

Big D

Little A, double-A

Big D, little A, double L-A-S!
