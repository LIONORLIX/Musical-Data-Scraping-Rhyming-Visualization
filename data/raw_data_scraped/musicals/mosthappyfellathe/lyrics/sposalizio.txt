Sposalizio




Sposalizio!



Sposalizio!



Sposalizio!



Hey! Look at the lights,

Look at the food

Lookat th eflowers

Hey! Look at the wine,

Look at the place!



I like a great big Italian sposalizio

Set it up and I'll be there!

With the lanterns glowing

And the vino flowing

And the good, strong smell of

Mozzarella in the air.



The smell of mozzarella

Mozzarella in the air.



Great big Italian sposalizio

Lay it count and count me in



I'm the kind of fella



Love to go out



Likes a tarantella



To a blowout



To the fine, fine music

Of a mellow mandolin



Music of a mellow mandolin



With all the neighbors, and all the

Neighbors'neighbors

All the friends, and all of their friends

And the 'mangia, mangia, mangia'

Never ends!

Neer ends!



I like a great big Italian sposalizio

Set it up and I'll be there!

With the lanterns glowing

Look at 'em over your head!

And the vino flowing

Malaga, Malaga red!

And the good, strong smell of

Mozzarella in the air.

Set it up!



Set it up, set it up, set it up!



And I'll be there!



With all the neighbors, and all the

Neighbors'neighbors

All the friends, and all of their friends

And the 'mangia, mangia, mangia'

Never ends!

Neer ends!



I like a great big Italian sposalizio

Set it up and I'll be there!

With the lanterns glowing

And the vino flowing

And the good, strong smell of

Mozzarella in the air.

Set it up!

And I'll be there!
