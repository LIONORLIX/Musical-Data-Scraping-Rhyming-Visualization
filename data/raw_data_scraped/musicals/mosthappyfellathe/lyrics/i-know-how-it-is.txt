I Know How It Is


I know how it is.



Don't tell me. I know how it is.

When you're number twenty-seven on the list

Being kissed Is not exactly being:



I kno whow it is



Don't tell me. I know how it is.

But when you're just twenty-seven in his book

Getting 'took out' is much more like getting 'took!'



I know how it is

Don't tell me

I know how it is



:seven million crumbs and a gravy spot,

teaspoon stuck in the mustard pot,

napkin on the floor, ashes in the cup,

and one Canadian dime:

so ya pick it up,

with the seven million crumbs and the.
