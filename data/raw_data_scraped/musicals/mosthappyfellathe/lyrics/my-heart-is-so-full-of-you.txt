My Heart is So Full of You


My heart is so full Rosabella, you

Of you,

So full of you Make me a man

There is no room Crazy like fire

For anything more. Crazy with love.

What other wish Crazy with love!

Can I wish?

What other plan Ah, sono contento

Can I plan?

What other dream Son contento!

Can I dream?

And what for? Tu mi stai a cuore!

Whatever for?



When my heart is so full of you

When my heart is so full of you



So full of you So full of you

There is no room He's got no room

No room in my No room in my

Heart Heart

For anything more. For anything more.



My wife

She's-a love me now! What other wish

Can I wish?

My wife, she's-a love What other plan

Me now. Can I plan?

My wife she's-a fall What other dream

In love Can I dream?

Wit' me! And what for,

Whatever for?

When

My heart is so full of you

So full of you



There is no room Now my young

New heart

No room in my heart Ain't got no more

Room

For anything more.
