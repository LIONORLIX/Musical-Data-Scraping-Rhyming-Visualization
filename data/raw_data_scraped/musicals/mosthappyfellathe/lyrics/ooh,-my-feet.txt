Ooh, My Feet


Ooh my feet! My poor, poor feet!

Betcha your life a waitress earns her pay

I've been on my feet, my poor, poor feet

All day long today.



Oooh my toes! My poor, poor toes!

How can I give the service with the smile

When I'm on my toes, my poor, poor toes

Mile after mile after mile after mile

After mile?



This little piggy's only broken

This little piggy's on the bum

This little piggy's in the middle

Consequently, absolutely numb.

This little piggy

Feels the weight of the plate

Though the freights

Just an order of melba toast

And this little piggy

Is the littlest little piggy

But the big son-of-a-bitch

Hurts the most!



Ooooh my feet! My poor, poor feet!

Betcha your life a waitress earns her pay

I've been on my feet, my poor, poor feet

All day long today.



Doing my blue plate special ballet!
