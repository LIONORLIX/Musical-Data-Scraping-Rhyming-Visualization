Standing on the Corner


Standing on the corner

Watching all the girls go by

Standing on the corner

Watching all the girls go by



Brother you don't know

A nicer occupation

Matter of fact neither do I



Than standing on the corner

watching all the girls,

watching all the girls ,

watching all the girls go by



I'm the cat that cot the cream

Haven't got a girl, but I can dream

Haven't got a girl, but I can wish,

So I take me down to Main Street

And that's where I select my

Imaginary dish!



Standing on the corner

Watching all the girls go by

Standing on the corner

Watching all the girls go by



Brother, if you've got

A rich imagination

Give it a whirl, give it a try,



Try standing on the corner

watching all the girls,

watching all the girls ,

watching all the girls go by



Saturday and I'm so broke

Couldn't buy a girl a nickel coke

Still I'm living like a millionaire

When I take me down to Main Street

And I receive the harem

Parading for me there



Standing on the corner

Watching all the girls go by.

Standing on the corner

Underneath a springtime sky.



Brother you can't go to jail

For what you're thinking

Or for the oooh! look in your eye



You're only standing on the corner

Watching all the girls,

Watching all the girls,

Watching all the girls go by
