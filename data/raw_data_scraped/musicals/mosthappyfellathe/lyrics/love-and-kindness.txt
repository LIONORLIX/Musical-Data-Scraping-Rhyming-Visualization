Love and Kindness


Easy:

Take medicine, take tonic, take pills

But none of them will cure and old

Grouch of his ills.

If you've got to take something,

Take a precription

That's old as the hills



Take love and kindness,

Love and kindness

Love and kindness

From the nurse

The good looking nurse.



Take love and kindness

Love and kindness,

And you will never, ever

Take a turn for the worse.



She's good for what ails you

When you feel ready to hollor and curse.



Take Take love and kindness

Love and kindness,

And you will never, ever

Take a turn for the worse.



She's good for what ails you

When you feel ready to hollor and curse.



Take love and kindness

Love and kindness,

And you will never, ever

Take a turn for the worse.
