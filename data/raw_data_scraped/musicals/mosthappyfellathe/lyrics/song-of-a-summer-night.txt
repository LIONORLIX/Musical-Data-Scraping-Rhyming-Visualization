Song of a Summer Night


All nature seems to know

There are two lovers tonight

There are two lovers tonight

Hereabouts, all nature seems to know

And sing her son,

Her tender son

That all is well

And all is right.



Do you hear what I hear?



Do you hear what I hear?



Song of a summer night

Song of a summer night

Song of a thousand voices

Full of a rare delight

I hear it in the air

It's a kind of lovers' music

Kind of music for the happy, happy pair.

Listen! Listen to the

Song of the cricket call

Song of the lazy breeze

Song of the blossom falling

Down from the 'cacia trees

I hear it everywhere

It's a kind of lovers' music

Kind of music for the happy lovers.

Listen, listen to it.



Look! Here comes

The blushing, blushing bride

Ah1 look! Here comes

The happy, happy groom.

Ah! Let's all leave them standing side by side

Ah yes, they wanna be alone,

They wanna be alone, alone, alone

Leave 'em alone, alone, alone

Leave 'em alone to hear the

Song of the summer night

Somg of the summe rnight

Song of a thousand voices

Full of a rare delight

I hear it in the air

It's a kind of lovers' music

Kind of music for the happy, happy pair.

Softly, gently playing,

Leave them, let's leave them

Leave them, let's leave them
