Don't Cry


Don't cry. Don't cry

Come on back in the house

And don't cry

Come on back in the house

And get out from under

That old, old sky



Don't weep. Don't weep

Come on back in the house,

Little sheep

Come on back in the house

For a smile of welcome

And go to sleep



Guess I know how you feel

It's that wild run away feeling

In your heart

When you've had the wrong dream

And you wake with a start



Well don't cry. Don't cry

Come on back in the house

And don't cry

Come on back in the house

And get out from under

That old, old shy.

Guess I know how you feel:



Tony sure is a fine feller

With the strength He's an old man,

Of a giant An old man

And the soul of I don't want him

A saint: leaning all over me.



With the strength The strength of a

Of a giant Giant

And the smile of But an old man,

A baby An old man

I don't want him

Breathing all over

Me!



Don't cry. Don't cry

Come on back in the house

And don't cry

Come on back in the house

And get out from under

That old, old sky
