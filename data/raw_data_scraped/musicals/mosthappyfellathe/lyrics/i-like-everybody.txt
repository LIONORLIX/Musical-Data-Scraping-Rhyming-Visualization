I Like Everybody


Smile, smile, smile

That's all you do is smile

You tell the whole damn world

To step right up and take advantage,



Oh, I don't mind.



You don't mind!



I like everybody that I've ever met

I never met anybody that got me upset

No chip on my shoulder

Hate in my heart or green in my eye

And as I get older I find that

More and more

I like ev'rybody that's my kind of fun

And tho' I strike ev'rybody as chump

Number one



No robber can rob

This good natural slob

Of his private sky of blue,

I like everybody

And extra spec'lly

I like you.

I like you.

I like you.
