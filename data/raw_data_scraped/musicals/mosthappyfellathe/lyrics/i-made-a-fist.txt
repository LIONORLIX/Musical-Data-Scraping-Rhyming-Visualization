I Made A Fist


I made a fist!

I made a fist!

I folded up the fingers of my left hand

And there it was

Exactly at the end of my wrist!



Herman, my hero! Herman, my hero!



I made afrown!

I made a frown!

It started with a pucker in my eyebrows

I got so mad

The corners of my mouth turned down!



Herman, my hero!



And I can lick anybody in town!

Since I made a fist and a frown!



Herman, my hero! Herman, my hero!

Herman, my hero! Herman, my hero!
