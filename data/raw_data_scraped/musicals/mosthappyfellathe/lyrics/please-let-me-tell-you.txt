Please Let Me Tell You


Please let me tell you that I love you.

Just one more time before I go.

Please let me tell you that I love you,

'Cause it happens to be so.

How I hurt you and

How you must hate me!

I know, oh God, I know!

But let me tell you that I love you

That's all and now I'll go.
