Anyone Can Whistle


FAY:

Anyone can whistle,

That's what they say-

Easy.

Anyone can whistle

Any old day-

Easy.

It's all so simple:

Relax, let go, let fly.

So someone tell me why

Can't I?

I can dance a tango,

I can read Greek-

Easy.

I can slay a dragon

Any old week-

Easy.

What's hard is simple.

What's natural comes hard.

Maybe you could show me

How to let go,

Lower my guard,

Learn to be free.

Maybe if you whistle,

Whistle for me.
