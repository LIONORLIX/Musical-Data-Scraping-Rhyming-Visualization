Everybody Says Don't


HAPGOOD:

Everybody says don't,

Everybody says don't,

Everybody says don't-

It isn't right,

Don't-it isn't nice!

Everybody says don't,

Everybody says don't,

Everybody says don't walk on the grass,

Don't disturb the peace,

Don't skate on the ice.

Well, I

Say

Do,

I say,

Walk on the grass, it was meant to feel!

I

Say

Sail!

Tilt at the windmill,

And if you fail, you fail.

Everybody says don't,

Everybody says don't,

Everybody says don't get out of line.

When they say that, then

Lady that's a sign:

Nine times out of ten,

Lady, you are doing just fine!



Make just a ripple.

Come on be brave.

This time a ripple,

Next time a wave

Sometimes you have to start small,

Climbing the tiniest wall,

Maybe you're going to fall-

But it is better than not starting at all!

Everybody says no,

Everybody says stop.

Everybody says mustn't rock the boat,

Mustn't touch a thing!

Everybody says don't,

Everybody says wait,

Everybody says can't fight city hall,

Can't upset the cart,

Can't laugh at the king!

Well, I

Say

Try!

I

Say

Laugh at the kings or they'll make you cry.

Lose

Your

Poise!

Fall if you have to,

But lady, make a noise!

Everybody says don't,

Everybody says can't,

Everybody says wait around for miracles,

That's the way the world is made!

I insist on

Miracles, if you do them,

Miracles - nothing to them!

I say don't,

Don't be afraid!
