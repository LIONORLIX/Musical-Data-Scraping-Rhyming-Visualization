The Mayoress is so depressed by her unpopularity that she makes a nostalgic pilgrimage to a huge rock on the outskirts of town.

I am in the depths of positive despair.

Ah now, Cora, you need to relax.

I need a miracle, that's what I need.

Suddenly, Baby Joan licks the rock and there is an enormous spurt of water.

Your honor, it's a miracle!

It's what?

A miracle! It's a miracle!

You know, you're absolutely right. It is a miracle. I'm saved.
