Me and My Town


MAYORESS CORA HOOVER HOOPER:

Everyone hates me-yes, yes-

Being the Mayoress, yes.

All of the peasants

Throw rocks in my presence,

Which causes me nervous distress, yes.

OOOH, OOOOOOOOOH, OOOH, OOH, OOOOOOOOOH.



Me and my town, battered about,

Everyone in it would like to get out.

But me and my town,

We just wanna be loved!



Stores are for rent, theatres are dark,

Grass on the sidewalks, but not in the park,

Me and my town,

We just wanna be loved!



The people are starving,

So they sleep the day through.

My poor little people,

What can they do?



TOWNSPEOPLE:

Boo!



CORA:

Who asked you?



Come on the train, come on the bus,

Somebody please buy a ticket to us.

Hurry on down-

We need a little renown.

Love me,

Love my

Town!



OOOHHHH OOOOOHHHHH OOOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHHHHH!



BOYS:

Hi there, Cora. What's new?



CORA:

The bank went bust and I'm feeling blue.



BOYS:

And who took over the bankruptcy?



CORA:

Me, boys, me!



BOYS:

Si, si!



CORA:

Me, boys, me!



BOYS:

Tell us, Cora, how you are.



CORA:

I just got back from the reservoir.



BOYS:

And what's the state of the water supply?



CORA:

Dry, boys, dry!



BOYS:

My, my!



CORA:

Dry, boys, dry!



BOYS:

Ay, ay!



CORA:

A lady has responsibilities...



BOYS:

Responsibilities...



CORA:

And civic pride!



BOYS:

Civic pride!



CORA:

Well, I look around and what do I see? I see no crops.



BOYS:

No crops.



CORA:

I see no business.



BOYS:

No business



CORA:

To the North, to the South,

Only hoof-and-mouth!



BOYS:

To the East, to the West,

No community chest



CORA:

I see a terrible depression all over the town-



BOYS:

Oh, a terrible depression,

Yes, a terrible depression.



CORA:

What a terrible depression

And I'm so depressed

I can hardly talk on the phone.

I feel all alone.



CORA AND BOYS:

But a lady has responsibilities-



BOYS:

Responsibilities-



CORA:

To all my poor! Starving! Cold! Miserable!

Dirty! Dreary! Depressing! Peasants!



ALL:

Peasants! Ick!



CORA:

A lady has responsibilities-



BOYS:

Responsibilities-



CORA:

To try to be

Popular with the populace.



BOYS:

She's unpopular with the populace!



ALL:

Unpopular with the populace,

Unpopular with the populace,

Unpopular with the populace...



CORA:

Everyone here hates me at length,

Probably lynch me if they had the strength.

But me and my town,

Me and my town,

We just wanna be loved!



BOYS:

We just want to be loved!

We just want to be loved!



CORA:

Just loved!



BOYS:

A friendship is lovely

And a courtship sublime,

But give her a township-



CORA:

Township!

Every time!



ALL:

What'll we do, me and my town?

Gotta do something or we're gonna drown!

Give me my coat,

Give me my crown,

Gimme, gimme your vote

And hurry on down!



CORA:

Show how much you think



BOYS:

Yeah!



CORA:

Of me!



ALL:

Love me,

Love my

Town!
