See What It Gets You


FAY:

Take one step

And see what it gets you.

See what it gets you.

See what it gets you!

One step up

And see how it gets you

Down.

Give yourself,

If somebody lets you-

See what it gets you.

See what it gets you!

Give yourself,

And somebody lets you

Down.

Here's how to crawl,

Now, run, lady!

Here's how to walk.

Now fly!

Here's how to feel-Have fun, lady.

And a fond goodbye!

Reach out your hand

And see what it gets you.

See what it gets you.

See what it gets you!

Trouble is, whatever it gets,

You find

That once you see, you can't stay blind.

What do I do now.

Now that my eyes are wide?

But when the world goes mad,

Then they've got to be shown.

And when the hero quits,

Then you're left on your own.

And when you want things done,

You have to do them yourself alone!

And if I'm not ready

And lightheaded,

I can't stand here dumb.

So, ready or not, here-I hope-I come!



Anyone can whistle, that's what they say-

Easy.

Anyone can whistle any old day-

Easy.

It's all so simple: relax, let go, let fly.

And someone tell me, why can't I?

Whistle at the dragon: down it'll fall.

-Easy.

Whistle at a hero, trumpets and all

-Easy.

Just once I'll do it,

Just once before I die.

Lead me to the battle,

What does it take?

Over the top!

Joan at the stake!

Anyone can whistle-

(She tries unsuccessfully)

Well, no one can say

I didn't try!
