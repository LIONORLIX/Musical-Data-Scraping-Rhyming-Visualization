Hooray for Hapgood


GROUP A:

Hooray for A, the group that's well-adjusted,

Everyone can be trusted

In Group A!



GROUP ONE:

Have fun with One, the group that's not neurotic.

Everyone's patriotic

In Group One!



BOTH GROUPS:

Dignity, integrity and so on,

We haven't much to go on,

Still we go on.

We've a platform strong enough to grow on:



GROUP A:

Whenever they cheer, we're incensed!



GROUP ONE:

Whenever they're for, we're against!



GROUP A:

Hooray for Hapgood,

Hapgood can be trusted,

Friend of the well-adjusted

In Group A!...



NARRATOR:

Hapgood appears, carried aloft in Cora's litter, and they follow him out of the square, leaving it deserted - except for a dazzling redhead in dark glasses.



FAY:

Bonjour.
