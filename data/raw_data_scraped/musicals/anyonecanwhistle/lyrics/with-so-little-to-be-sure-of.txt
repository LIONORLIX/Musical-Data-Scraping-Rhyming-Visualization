With So Little to Be Sure Of


HAPGOOD:

With so little to be sure of,

If there's anything at all.

If there's anything at all.

I'm sure of here and now and us together.

All I'll ever be I owe you,

If there's anything to be.

Being sure enough of you

Makes me sure enough of me.

Thanks for everything we did,

Everything that's past,

Everything's that's over too fast.

None of it was wasted,

All of it will last:

Everything that's here and now and us together!

It was marvelous to know you

And it isn't really through.

Crazy business this, this life we live in-

Can't complain about the time we're given-

With so little to be sure of in this world,

We had a moment!

A marvelous moment!



FAY:

A marvelous moment!

A beautiful time.



I need you more than I can say.

I need you more than just today.

I guess I need you more than you need me.

And yet I'm happy.

All I'll ever be I owe you.



HAPGOOD:

The more I memorize your face,



FAY:

If there's anything to be.



HAPGOOD:

The more I never want to leave.



FAY:

Being sure enough of you

Made me sure enough of me.



HAPGOOD:

Come with me, Fay.

(The following is sung

SIMULTANEOUSLY)



FAY:

Thanks for everything we did,

...

Everything that's past,

Everything's that's over

Too fast.

None of it was wasted.

...

All of it will last:

...



HAPGOOD:

...

There's more to love

In me right now

Than all the bit of love

I've known before.

...

None of it was wasted.

...

All of it will last:



BOTH:

Everything that's here and now and us together!

It was marvelous to know you

And it's never really through.

Crazy business this, this life we live in-

Can't complain about the time we're given-

With so little to be sure of in this world,



FAY:

Hold me.

Hold me.
