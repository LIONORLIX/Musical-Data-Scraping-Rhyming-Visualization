The Cookie Chase


CORA:

Lock 'em up! Put 'em away

In the Jar!

Time to start getting the nets out!

Lock 'em up!

Into the cage!

Quietly: no one must know.

Cart 'em of into the bin,

Turn the key.

Quick before anyone gets out!

Turn the key, throw it away,

There we are. Forty-eight to go!



Detmold! Check in your patients.



DETMOLD:

Yes, Your Honor? Your name, Madame?



OLD LADY:

This doesn't fit. It's much too big, I wear a size three-well, maybe a four.



DETMOLD:

Did you always hate your father?



CORA:

Detmold, arrest her now and convict her later. There is really only one question that needs answering:

Are they breathing? Then they're Cookies.

Are they moving? Then they're Cookies.

Are they living? Then they're Cookies.

So get on with it! Quick, get on with it!

Are they human? Then they're Cookies.

So shut up, my dear Doctor, and shut up her too!

Lookie, lookie, here comes Cookie

Now.

Naughty Cookie, playing hookey-

That we don't allow.

Cigarette?

Light?

Thanks.

Get them.

You take the key, my love,

I'm too exhausted to move!

Music, I must have music,

A moment's music or my head will burst!

I know you'll meet the test-

You've been well rehearsed.

Do your best

(Meaning do your worst),

Let me rest

And remember, Schubchen:

Women and children first!



CORA, SCHUB, COOLEY AND MAGRUDER:

Hmm...

Lock 'em up! Put 'em away

In the Jar!

Time to start getting the nets out!

Lock 'em up!

Into the cage!

Quietly: no one must know.



QUARTET AND ENSEMBLE:

Lock 'em up! Put 'em away

In the Jar!

Time to start getting the nets out!

Lock 'em up!

Into the cage!

Quietly: no one must know.

Cart 'em of into the bin,

Turn the key.

Quick before anyone gets out!

Turn the key, throw it away,

There we are. Forty-two to go!



FAY:

Ooh, la, la. Monsieur Schub.



SCHUB:

Not yet gone back to Lourdes yet?



FAY:

Non.



SCHUB:

Pourquoi pas?



FAY:

Pourquoi you hold ze key to my heart.
