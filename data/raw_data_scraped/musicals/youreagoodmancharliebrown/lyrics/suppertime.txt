Suppertime


SNOOPY:

My stomach just went off. It's suppertime, and Charlie Brown has forgotten to feed me.

Here I lie, a withering hollow shell of a dog and there sits my supper

dish ... EMPTY! But that's all right. He'll remember.

When no furry friend comes to greet him after school, then he'll remember!

And he'll rush out here to the doghouse but it'll be too late.

There will be nothing left but the dried carcass of his former friend

who used to love to run and play so happily with him.

Nothing left but the bleached puppy bones of...



CHARLIE BROWN:

Hey Snoopy! Are you asleep or something?

I've been standing here a whole minute with your supper and you haven't even noticed.

It's suppertime..



SNOOPY:

Suppertime? Suppertime?



BEHOLD A BRIMMING BOWL OF MEAT AND MEAL.

WHICH IS BROUGHT FORTH TO EASE OUR HUNGER.

BEHOLD THE FLOWING FLAGON MOIST AND SWEET

WHICH HAS BEEN SENT TO SLAKE OUR THIRST.



CHARLIE BROWN:

Okay there is no need to a big production!

Just get down off that doghouse and eat!



SNOOPY:

AND WHEN SUPPER TIME COMES,

CAN SUPPER BE FAR AWAY?



BRING ON THE SOUP DISH, BRING ON THE CUP.

BRING ON THE BACON AND FILL ME UP!

SNOOPY:

CHORUS:

(Suddenly, the off stage voices stop, and Snoopy is alone singing)



GIMME FOOD, GIMME WATER, GIMME SOMETHIN' TO CHEW!

GIMME FOOD, GIMME WATER, GIMME SOMETHIN' TO DO!



CHARLIE BROWN:

NOW CUT THAT OUT!!!! Now,

why can't you eat your meal quietly and calmly like any other normal dog?



SNOOPY:

So what's wrong with making mealtime a joyous occasion?



SUPPER SUPPER SUPPER SUPPERRRRRRRRR-TIME!!!!!



LUCY:

Well, I don't know, Linus,

it looks like an airplane to me the way the lights are blinking on and off.

Schroeder, it that an airplane or a star?



SCHROEDER:

I believe that is a star. But you know it could be a planet.

Or maybe even a satellite.



SALLY:

It could be a satellite. I wonder.



LINUS:

Well, we'll never find out by just sitting here.



LUCY:

Where are you going?



LINUS:

I'm going over here to get a closer look.



SNOOPY:

I like to sit up here after supper and listen to the sounds of the night.

But somehow something seems to be missing. (He lets out a big howl.)

In my opinion, that's exactly what it needed.



CHARLIE BROWN:

I'm so happy! The little red-haired girl dropped her pencil.

It has teeth marks all over it. She nibbles her pencil.

She's human! It hasn't been such a bad day after all.
