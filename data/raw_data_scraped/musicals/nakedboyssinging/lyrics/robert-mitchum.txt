Robert Mitchum


There must be something wrong with me

Cause' I don't find in the least sexy

All those pretty boys with their perfect bods

Prancin' around like Hollywood gods

Yet, everywhere that I care to look

In every movie and every book

I see, I see, I see those guys with their deltoids pumped

And their sex appeal has my libido stumped



As for me, I long for the days of Robert Mitchum

I know, he was a little beefy and soft

But, when he took it all off

He was bitchin'

As for me, I long for the days when guys didn't look like they spent all week at a gym

When skinny legs and love handles were in

At least a smidgen

Give me Robert Mitchum



Now, I'm not immune to the well known charms

Of a drop dead chest and some well toned arms

But a little flaw here and there makes it hard for me not to stare

Now, I'll never look like Marky Mark

But some people say I've a real big heart

It's true, it's true, oh god, I woulda been hot back then

Before the age of implants and calogens



As for me, I long for the days of Robert Mitchum

Though he smoked and did a lot of bad stuff, but...

When he acted real tough

He had me twitchin'

As for me, I long for the days when guys didn't drink bottled water, but bottles of gin

Or fret about the state of the skin

That's when I would ditch em

Give me Robert Mitchum



Does anybody remember him in "Cape Fear?"

Now that was a moving experience.

He was homicidally, sexually serious.



Bad to the core, and the little he wore

I'll never forget, and better yet

When his bedroom eyes came into view

You know he knew just what to do

A perfect ten back in the days of real men like...

Robert Mitchum

And I'm not alone



As for us, we long for the days of Robert Mitchum

When guys came in all sizes and shapes

Some could even get dates

And while we're dishin'

As for us, we long for days when guys weren't so young

Or tall, or thin, or perfectly done

Hell, let's be frank, so perfectly hung

A perfect ten back in the days of real men like...

Robert Mitchum
