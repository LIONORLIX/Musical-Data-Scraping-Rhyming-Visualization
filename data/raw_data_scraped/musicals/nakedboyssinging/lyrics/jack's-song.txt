Jack's Song


When all those trials and tribulations gather daily at my door.

When all those petty aggravations are attracting even more.

In my hour of desperation something always pulls me through.

Thus I find rejuvenation doing what I always do.

I beat my meat.

I beat my meat.

I get a grip and if it's stiff I'm gonna give myself a treat.

I seek relief.

I pound my beef.

I breathe a sigh and yet if I don't feel contented and complete.

I just repeat.

I beat my meat.

You don't needan education.

You don't need a PHD.

All you need is concentration and the rest comes naturally.

You don't need collaberation.

Calvin Kleins or great physiques.

Now we'll do a demonstration of a few of our techniques.

I beat my meat.

I beat my meat.

I get a grip and if it's stiff I'm gonna give myself a treat.

I beat my meat.

I beat my meat.

I breathe a sigh and yet if i don't feel contented and complete.

Then I repeat, then I repeat, then I repeat.

I beat my meat.



What in the (?) moralizing.

But our favorite form of exercizing.

Is socially correct.

As well as as advertising.

Cause who would serve a steak in need of tenderizing.

So...I beat my meat.

I beat my meat

And since it's stiff I get a grip.

I'm gonna give myself a treat.

I beat my meat.

I beat my meat.

And when I do I'm telling you I'm contented and complete.

I get a thrill. I get the grill. Change my attire. And light the fire.

I salt I oil and then I broil then we say grace and then we eat.

But first I beat, but first I beat, but first I beat, but first I beat but first I beat
