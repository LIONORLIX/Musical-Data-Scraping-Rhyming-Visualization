Nothin' But the Radio On


Honey, Aunt Ruby just gave Daddy and me this Playgirl magazine.

Now, I can't believe you'd expose yourself like that.

I don't know how I'm ever gonna hold my head up in this town again.

What were you thinking?



Hey Chris, why didn't you tell me you were gonna ruin your career not to mention mine?

I'm your agent, we've gotta talk. Hold on I've got another call coming in.



Marilyn Monroe posed without clothes

for a backroom calendar.

One of those. The nation was shocked.

Mama called her a sleaze.

But she sold a million calendars and tripled her fees.

She was just stark and a little naive.

When the press asked "Hon, what did you have on?"

Would you believe she said? "

I had nothing but the radio on,

nothing but the radio on.

Now tell me boys is that so wrong?

You'd best be believing it was playing the sweetest song.

With nothing but the radio on."

Young Burt Reynolds did his own spread.

In Cosmo magazine, everybody has read.

On a bearskin rug with a grin on his face.

With one hand over his talent. The man has taste.

And two seconds later Momma's just stunned.

But when the talk died down in our sleepy town.

Burt was the new number one.

And he had nothing but the radio on.

Nothing but the radio on.

Now tell me boys is that so wrong.

You'd best be believing it was playing the sweetest song.

Nothing but the radio on.



With nothing but a few dreams and a pleasing personality.

Though I had ambition I was shy.

But you know I kinda like being in the light.

When the cameras started clicking

I was a star burning bright. Burning bright.

And I had nothing but the radio on.

Nothing but the radio,

nothing but the radio,

nothing but the radio on.

Now I don't believe that it's oh so wrong.

And from now on they'll be playing my country song.

Nothing but the radio on.



I'm at my best. I'm better than all the rest.

With nothing but the radio on.
