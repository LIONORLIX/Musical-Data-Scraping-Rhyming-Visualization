When the Sun Goes Down in the South


When the sun goes down in the south

And the moon comes up in the East

Step right up and see the wonder of the ages

It's guaranteed visual feast



CHORUS:

When the darkness falls on the town

And the North Star's startin' to rise

Well, you can't imagine the menagerie aire

Created by a couple of guys



Well, anybody wonderin' what they're going to see

Gonna have to ante up a dollar for the ticket

Anybody wonderin' who's goin' on

Is gonna find out when they chase us through the thicket



(REPEAT CHORUS)



When the sun goes down in the South

And the hayseeds stand in line

Well, step right up and see the duo bodily do

The do wah ditty on the clothesline



(REPEAT CHORUS)



When the darkness falls on the town

And the North Star's startin' to rise

Oh, you can't imagine the menagerie aire

Created by a couple of guys



(REPEAT 1ST VERSE AND CHORUS)



Well anybody wonderin' what they' re going to see

Gonna have to ante up a dollar for the ticket

Anybody wonderin' who's goin' on

They're gonna find out when they're chasin' us through the thicket



When the sun goes down in the South

And the North Star's startin' to rise

Oh, you can't imagine the menagerie aire

Created by a couple of guys



(REPEAT 1ST VERSE AND CHORUS)
