Leavin's Not the Only Way to Go


Did the morning come too early

Was the night not long enough

Does a tear of hesitation

Fall on everything you touch

Well, it might just be a lesson

For the hasty heart to know

Maybe leavin's not the only way to go



Maybe lay and let your feelings grow accustomed to the dark

Maybe morning's light, you just might solve the problems of the heart

And it all might be a lesson for the hasty heart to know

Maybe leavin's not the only way to go



People reach new understandings all the lime

They take a second look, maybe change their minds

People reach new understandings everyday

Tell me not to reach and I'll go away



Did the morning come too early

Was the night not long enough

Does a tear of hesitation

Fall on everything you touch

Well, it might just be a lesson

For the hasty heart to know

Maybe leavin's not the only way to go



And a heart without a home is such a lonesome row to hoe

Maybe leavin's not the only way to go
