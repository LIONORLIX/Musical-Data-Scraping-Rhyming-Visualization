I, Huckleberry, Me


I, Huckleberry, me

Somewhere sittin' underneath some tree

Somewhere maybe fishin'



Maybe someplace sittin' just wishin' I was fishin'

Oh, I, Huckleberry, me

Hereby declare myself to be

Nothin' ever other than

Exactly what I am



And I'll never change for no one

No matter what they say

If I want to smoke in church I'll smoke

If I want to pray I'll pray, oh



I, Huckleberry, me

Hereby declare myself to be

Nothin' ever other than

Exactly what I am



And I'll never change for no one

No matter what they say

If I want to go to school I'll go

If I want to stay away, I'll stay



Oh, I, Huckleberry, me

Hereby declare myself to be

Nothin' ever other than

Exactly what I am

Nothin' ever other than

Exactly what I am
