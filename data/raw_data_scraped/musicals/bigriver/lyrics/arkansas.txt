Arkansas


Arkansas, Arkansas

I lust love ole Arkansas

Love my ma, love my pa

But I just love ole Arkansas

Well, I ain't never traveled much

But someday when the money's such

I'd like to see the world and all

And take a run through Arkansas



I'd like to get my picture took

And put in it my memory book

And someday hang it on my wall

To say that I'd seen Arkansas



Arkansas, Arkansas

I lust love ole Arkansas

Love my ma, love my pa

But I just love ole Arkansas



Grandpa he has always good

I'd play horsey on his foot

He'd tell me when I'd get tall

We'd both go see Arkansas

Arkansas, Arkansas

I lust love ole Arkansas

Love my ma, love my pa

But I just love ole Arkansas



Arkansas, Arkansas

I lust love ole Arkansas

Love my ma, love my pa

But I just love ole Arkansas

I just love ole Arkansas
