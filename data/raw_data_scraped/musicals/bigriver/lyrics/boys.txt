Boys


If the bunch of us all stick together

And we all go down as one

We could be highway robbers

We could be killers just out to have fun



And if any of you can't keep a secret

We'll cut your throat if you tell

Then lay down 'neath six feet of ground

'Cause we were born to raise hell

Chorus:

All together now were the boys

All together forever and always

All together now we are the boys

We're together forever and always



If the bunch of us all, now listen,

'Cause here's the part I like the best



If we all got a hold of some horses

We could ride like the boys out West

We could hoot shoot, and we could holler

We could ride like the devil wind

Then go back to the cave and sleep all day

And do it the next night again



(Repeat Chorus)



If the bunch of us all stick together

And we all go down as one

We could be highway robbers

We could be killers just out to have fun



And if the bunch of us all form a circle

And surround all the ladies of the town

I said hey, hey hey we'll take them to the cave

And dance them till they all fall down

(Repeat Chorus Twice)
