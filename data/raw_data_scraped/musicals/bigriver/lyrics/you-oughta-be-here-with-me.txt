You Oughta Be Here With Me


If you think it's lonesome where you are tonight

Then you oughta be here with me

If you think there's heartaches where you are tonight

Then you oughta be here with me



CHORUS:

Because with you I'm whole, without you I'm cold

So if you think about me where you are tonight

Then you oughta be here with me



If teardrops are falling where you are tonight

Then you oughta be here with me

Loneliness calling where you are tonight

Then you oughta be here with me



CHORUS:

Because with you I'm whole, without you I'm cold

So if you think about me where you are tonight

Then you oughta be here with me
