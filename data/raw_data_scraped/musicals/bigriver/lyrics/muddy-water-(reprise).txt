Muddy Water (Reprise)


Well, I been down to the pain and sorrow

Of no tomorrows comin' in

But I put my pole to the river bottom

And I've got to hide some place and find myself again



So, look out for me, oh muddy water

Your mysteries are deep and wide

And I got a need for going some place

And I got a need to climb upon your back and ride
