Worlds Apart


JIM:

I see the same stars through my window

That you see through yours

But we're worlds apart

Worlds apart

And I see the same skies through brown eyes

That you see through blue

But we're worlds apart, worlds apart

Just like the earth, just like the sun

Two worlds together are better than one

I see the sun rise in your eyes

That you see in mine

But we're worlds apart, worlds apart



HUCK:

I see the same stars through my window

That you see through yours

But we're worlds apart, worlds apart



BOTH:

And you see the same skies through brown eyes

That I see through blue

But we're worlds apart, worlds apart

Just like the earth, just like the sun

Two worlds together are better than one

I see the friendship in you eyes

That you see in mine

But we're worlds apart, worlds apart

Together, but worlds apart

And a mockingbird sings in an ol' yonder tree

Twaddle-ee ah dee dee dah dee dee dee
