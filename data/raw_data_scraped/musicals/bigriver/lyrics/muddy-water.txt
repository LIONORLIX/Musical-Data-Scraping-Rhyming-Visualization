Muddy Water


CHORUS:

Look out for me, oh muddy water

Your mysteries are deep and wide

And I got a need for going some place

And I got a need to climb upon your back and ride



You can look for me when you see me comin'

I may be runnin' I don't know

I may be tired and runnin' fever

But I'll be headed south to the mouth of the Ohio



Look out for me, oh muddy water

Your mysteries are deep and wide

And I got a need for going some place

And I got a need to climb upon your back and ride



Well, I been down to the pain and sorrow

Of no tomorrows comin' in

But I put my pole to the river bottom

And I've got to hide some place and find myself again



Look out for me, oh muddy water

Your mysteries are deep and wide

And I got a need for going some place

And I got a need to climb upon your back and ride
