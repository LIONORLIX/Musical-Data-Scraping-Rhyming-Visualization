Overture/Do Ya Wanna Go to Heaven


Looka here Huck, do you wanna go to heaven

Do you wanna go to heaven

Well I'll tell you right now

You better learn to read and you better learn your writin'

Or you'll never get to heaven cause you won't know how



You may think that the whole thing is silly

But it ain't silly really and I'll tell you right now

If you don't learn to read then you can't read your Bible

And you'll never get to heaven cause you won't know how



Looka here Huck, now you better think it over

Do ya wanna be a loafer like your pappy is now

You better learn to read and you better know your writin'

Or you'll never get to heaven cause you won't know how



Hey, hey do ya wanna go to heaven

Do ya wanna go to heaven

If you don't go to hell



Looka here Huck, do you wanna go to heaven

Do you wanna go to heaven

Well I'll tell you right now

You better learn to read and you better learn your writin'

Or you'll never get to heaven cause you won't know how



You may think that the whole thing is silly

But it isn't silly really and I'll tell you right now

If you don't learn to read then you can't read your Bible

You'll never get to heaven cause you won't know how



Looka here Huck, now you better think it over

Do ya wanna be a loafer like your poppy is now

You better learn to read and you better learn your writin'

Or you'll never get to heaven cause you won't know how



Hey, hey ain't the situation concernin' education aggravatin' and how

Do you wanna go to heaven

Well you better get your lessons or you won't know how



Looka here Huck, do you wanna be a feller

Like a feller really ought to be

I'll tell you right now,

You better learn to read and you better learn your writin'

Or you'll never get to heaven cause you won't know how
