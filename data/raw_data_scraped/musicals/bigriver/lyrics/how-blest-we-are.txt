How Blest We Are


How blest we are

As children of a God so good and true

To understand his moving hand

And, love for me and you

How blest we are

As children of a God

Whose love is real

Enough to touch each one of us

Is part of him I feel

I honor thee

I honor thee

To whom my love is vowed

How blessed be

Forever we are bound to him as now
