Waitin' for the Light to Shine (Reprise)


Well, I have lived on undirected life

A cloudy way I know, the only way I knew

And so the thing I've done

In fact each and every one

Is the way that I was taught to run



I am waitin' for the light to shine

I am waitin' for the light to shine

I have lived in the darkness for so long

I'm waitin' for the light to shine



Far beyond horizons I have seen

Beyond things I've been

Beyond the dreams I've dreamed

Are the things I've done

In fact each and every one

Are the way that I was taught to run



I am waitin' for the light to shine

I am waitin' for the light to shine

I have lived in the darkness for so long

I'm waitin' for the light to shine



I am waitin' for the light to shine

I am waitin' for the light to shine

I have lived in the darkness for so long

I'm waitin' for the light to shine
