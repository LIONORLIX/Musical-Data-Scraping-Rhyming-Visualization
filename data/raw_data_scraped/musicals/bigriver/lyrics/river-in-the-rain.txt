River in the Rain


CHORUS:

River in the rain

Sometimes at night you look like a long white train

Winding your way away somewhere

River I love you don't you care



If you're on the run winding some place

Just trying to find the sun

Whether the sunshine, whether the rain

River I love you just the same



But sometimes in a time of trouble

When you're out of hand

And your muddy bubbles roll across my floor

Carryin' away the things I treasure

Hell, there ain't no way to measure

Why I love you more than I did the day before



River in the rain

Sometimes at night you look like a long white train

Winding your way away somewhere

River I love you, don't you care



But sometimes in a time of trouble

When you're out of hand

And your muddy bubbles roll across my floor

Carryin' away the things I treasure

Hell, there ain't no way to measure

Why I love you more than I did the day before



River in the rain

Sometimes at night you look like a long white train

Winding your way away from me

River, I've never seen the sea
