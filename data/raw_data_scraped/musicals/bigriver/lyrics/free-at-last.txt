Free at Last


I wish by golly I could spread my wings and fly

And let my grounded soul be free for just a little while

To be like eagles when they ride upon the wind

And taste the sweetest taste of freedom for my soul



CHORUS:

Then I'd be free at last, free at last

Great God Almighty I'd be free at last



To let my feelings lie where harm can not come by

And hurt this always hurtin' heart

That needs to rest awhile

I wish by golly I could spread my wings and fly

And taste the sweetest taste of freedom for my soul



CHORUS:

Then I'd be free at last, free at last

Great God Almighty I'd be free at last

I'd be free at last, free at last

Great God Almighty I'd be free at last



(REPEAT CHORUS)
