Crossing


Crossing to the other side

We are pilgrims

On a journey through the darkness of the night

We are bound for other places

Crossing to the other side

I will worry 'bout tomorrow

When tomorrow comes in sight

Until then, Lord, I'm just a pilgrim

Crossing to the other side

Jesus will be there to meet me

He will reach his hand in mine

I will no more be a stranger

When I reach the other side
