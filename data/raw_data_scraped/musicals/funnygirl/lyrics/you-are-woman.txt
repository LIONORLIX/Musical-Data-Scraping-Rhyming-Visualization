You Are Woman


Nick:

You are woman, I am man,

You are smaller, so I can be taller than,

You are softer to the touch,

It's a feeling I like feeling very much.

You are someone I've admired,

Still, our friendship

Leaves something to be desired.

Does it take more explanation than this?

You are woman, I am man--

Let's kiss.

Fanny:

Isn't this the height of nonchalance,

Furnishing a bed in restaurants?

Well, a bit of dinner never hurt,

But guess who is gonna be dessert?

Do good girls do just what mama says,

When mama's not around?

It's a feeling,

Oy vey, what a feeling.

Nick:

A bit of pat??

Fanny:

I drink it all day.



Should I do the things he'll tell me to?

In this pickle what would Nellie do?

In my soul I feel an inner lack,

Just suppose he wants his dinner back?

Both:

Does it take more explanation than this?

Fanny:

Just some dried-out toast in a sliver,

On the top a little chopped liver.



How many girls become a sinner

While waiting for a roast beef dinner?

Though most girls slip in ordinary ways

I got style--I do it bordelaise.

Well, at least he thinks I'm special

--He ordered a la carte.

It's a feeling I like feeling very . . .

I feel the feeling down to my toes.

Now I feel that there's a fire here,

Try that once a little higher, dear,

What a beast to ruin such a pearl,

Would a convent take a Jewish girl?

Both:

Does it take more explanation than this?

Fanny:

Ooo, the thrills and chills goin' through me,

If I stop him now,

Can he sue me?

Nick:

You are woman . . .

Fanny:

You are man . . .

Both:

Let's kiss!
