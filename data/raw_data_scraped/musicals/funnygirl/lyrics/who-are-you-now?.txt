Who Are You Now?


Who are you now,

Now that you're mine?

Are you something more

Than you were before?

Are you warmer in the rain,

Are you stronger for my touch,

Am I giving too little

By my lovin' you too much?

How is the view,

Sunny and green?

How do you compare it to

The views you've seen?

I know I am better, braver and surer too,

But you--are you now--

Who are you now?

Are you someone better for my love?
