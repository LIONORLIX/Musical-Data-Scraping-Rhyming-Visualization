Plant A Radish


Plant a radish.

Get a radish.

Never any doubt.

That's why I love vegetables;

You know what you're about!



Plant a turnip.

Get a turnip.

Maybe you'll get two.

That's why I love vegetables;

You know that they'll come through!



They're dependable!

They're befriendable!

They're the best pal a parent's ever known!

While with children,

It's bewilderin'.

You don't know until the seed is nearly grown

Just what you've sown.



So

Plant a carrot,

Get a carrot,

Not a Brussels sprout.

That's why I love vegetables.

You know what you're about!



Life is merry,

If it's very

Vegetarian!

A man who plants a garden

Is a very happy man!



Plant a beanstalk.

Get a beanstalk.

Just the same as Jack.

Then if you don't like it,

You can always take it back!



But if your issue

Doesn't kiss you,

Then I wish you luck.

For once you've planted children,

You're absolutely stuck!



Every turnip green!

Every kidney bean!

Every plant grows according to the plot!



While with progeny,

It's hodge-podgenee.

For as soon as you think you know what kind you've got,

It's what they're not!



So

Plant a cabbage.

Get a cabbage.

Not a sauerkraut!

That's why I love vegetables.

You know what you're about!



Life is merry

If it's very

Vegetarian.

A man who plants a garden

Is a very happy man!



A vegitari-

Very merry

Vegetarian!
