They Were You


When the moon was young,

When the month was May,

When the stage was hung for my holiday,

I saw shining lights

But I never knew:

They were you.

They were you.

They were you.



When the dance was done,

When I went my way,

When I tried to find rainbows far away,

All the lovely lights

Seemed to fade from view:

They were you.

They were you.

They were you.



Without you near me,

I can't see.

When you're near me,

Wonderful things come to be.



Every secret prayer,

Every fancy free,

Everything I dared for both you and me.

All my wildest dreams

Multiplied by two

They were you.

They were you.

They were you.



They were you.

They were you.

They were you.
