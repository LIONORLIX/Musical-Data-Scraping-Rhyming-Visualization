I Can See It


Beyond that road lies a shining world.

Beyond that road lies despair.

Beyond that road lies a world that's gleaming.

People who are scheming.

Beauty!

Hunger!

Glory!

Sorrow!

Never a pain or care.

He's liable to find a couple of surprises there.



There's a song he must sing;

It's a well-known song.

But the tune is bitter

And it doesn't take long to learn!



I can learn!

That pretty little world that beams so bright.

That pretty little world that seems delightful

Can burn! Burn! Burn!

Let me learn! Let me learn!



For, I can see it!

Shining somewhere!

Bright lights somewhere invite me to come there

And learn!

And I'm ready!



I can hear it!

Sirens singing!

Inside my ear I hear them all singing

Come learn!



Who knows, maybe

All the visions I can see

May be waiting just for me

To say take me there, and



Make me see it!

Make me feel it!

I know it's so

I know that it really

May be!

Let me learn!



I can see it!

(He can see it!)

Shining somewhere!

(Shining somewhere!)



Those lights not only glitter

But once there they burn!



I can hear it!

(He can hear it!)

Sirens singing!

(Sirens singings!)



Don't listen close

Or maybe you'll never

Return!



Who know, maybe

All the visions that I (he) sees

May be waiting just for me (him) to

Say



I can see it!

Say

Shining somewhere!

Say

Let me see it!

Say

Take me there

And make me a part of it!



Make me see

Those shining sights inside of me!

(Make him see it!)



Make me feel

Those lights inside

Don't lie to me!

(Make him feel it!)



I (he) know(s) it's so --

I (he) know(s) that it really may be!



Just what I always waited for!

This is what my life's created for!



Let me (him) learn!
