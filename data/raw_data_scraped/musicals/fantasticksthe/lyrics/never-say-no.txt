Never Say No


Ohhhhhhhhhhhhh!



Dog's got to bark, a mule's got to bray.

Soldiers must fight and preachers must pray.

And children, I guess, must get their own way

The minute that you say no.



Why did the kids pour jam on the cat?

Raspberry jam all over the cat?

Why should the kids do something like that,

When all that we said was no?



My son was once afraid to swim.

The water made him wince.

Until I said he mustn't swim:

S'been swimmin' ever since!



S'been swimmin' ever since!



Ohhhhhhhhhhhhh!



Dog's got to bark, a mule's got to bray.

Soldiers must fight and preachers must pray.

And children, I guess, must get their own way

The minute that you say no.



Why did the kids put beans in their ears?

No one can hear with beans in their ears.

After a while the reason appears.

They did it cause we said no.



Your daughter brings a young man in,

Says "Do you like him, Pa?"

Just say that he's a fool and then:

You've got a son-in-law!



You've got a son-in-law!



Ohhhhhhhhhhhhh!



Sure as the June comes right after May!

Sure as the night comes right after day!

You can be sure the devil's to pay

The minute that you say no.



Make sure you never say...

No!
