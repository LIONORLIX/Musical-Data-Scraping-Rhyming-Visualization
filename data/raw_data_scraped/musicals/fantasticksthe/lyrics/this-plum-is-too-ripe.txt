This Plum Is Too Ripe


This plum is too ripe!

- Sorry!

Take away the golden moonbeam.

Take away the tinsel sky.

What at night seems oh so scenic

May be cynic by and by.



Take away the painted sunset.

Take away the blue lagoon.

What at night seems oh so scenic

May be cynic much too soon.



Take away the sense of drama.

Take away the puppet play.

What at night seems oh so scenic

May be cynic by today.



Take away the secret meetings.

Take away the chance to fight.

What at night seems oh so scenic

May be cynic in the light.



So take it away and paint it up right!

So take it away and decorate it!

So take it away; that sun is too bright!

I say that it really is a pity.

It used to be so pretty.

Much too soon.

By and by.
