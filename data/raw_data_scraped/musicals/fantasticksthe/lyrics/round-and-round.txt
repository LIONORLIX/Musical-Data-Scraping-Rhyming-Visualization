Round And Round


Round and round,

Till the break of day.

Candles glow,

Fiddles play.

Why not be wild if we feel that way?

Reckless and terribly gay!



Round and round,

'Neath a magic spell.

Velvet gown,

Pink lapel.

Life is a colorful carousel.

Reckless and terribly gay!



I'm ready anytime.

If you'll take me, I'm

Ready to go!



So show the way to me.

I will try to be

Ready to go!



I seem to see Venice:

We're on a lagoon.

A gondolier's crooning

A gondola tune.

The air makes your hair

Billow blue in the moon!



I could swoon!



You're so blue in the moon!



We'll just dance!

We'll kick up our heels to music and dance!

Until my head reels with music.

Just like a lovely real romance.

All we'll do is daily dance.



All we'll do is just dance.

All we'll do is just dance.

All we'll do is just



Round and round,

Till the break of day.

Candles glow,

Fiddles play.

Why not be wild if we feel that way?

Reckless and terribly gay!



I'm ready anytime.

If you'll take me, I'm

Ready to go!



So show the way to me.

I will try to be

Ready to go!



I seem to see Athens, it's terribly chic.

Atop the Acrop'lis, it's terribly Greek.

There's Venus, Adonis, 'n us

Cheek to cheek.



Oh how chic!



To be Greek cheek to cheek!



We'll just dance!

We'll kick up our heels to music and dance!

Until my head reels with music.

Just like a lovely real romance.

All we'll do is daily dance.



All we'll do is just dance.

All we'll do is just dance.

All we'll do is just --



Round and round,

'Neath a magic spell.

Velvet gown,

Pink lapel.

Life is a colorful carousel.

Reckless and terribly gay!



I'm ready anytime.

If you'll take me, I'm

Ready to go!



So show the way to me.

I will try to be

Ready to go!



We'll be in Bengasi or maybe Bombay.

I understand Indja is terribly gay.

The natives assemble on feast day and play



With their snakes?



What a racket it makes!



We'll

Just

Dance!



We'll kick up our heels to music and dance!

Until my head reels with music.

Just like a lovely real romance.



All we'll do is daily

I can see the friendly natives!

All we'll do is just dance.

All we'll do is just dance.

All we'll do is just

Round and round in a magic spell



All we'll do is just

All we'll do is just

All we'll do is just

All we'll do is just

All we'll do is just...

Dance!
