Metaphor


I don't what to call her!

She's too vibrant for a name!

Should I call her...Juliet!



Yes, dear



Helena!



Yes, dear!



And Cassandra, and Cleopatra, and Beatrice

And also Guenevere



What dear?



I think she's there.

Can you hear me?



(...)

Speak a little louder!



I love you!



Ah ah ah ah aaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!



If I were in the desert deep in sand,

And the sun was burning like a hot pomegranate:

Walking through a nightmare in the heat of a summer day,

Until my mind was parch-ed!

Then you are water...

Cool, clear water...

A refreshing glass of water!



What dear?



Water!



Ah ah ah aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!



Love! You are love!

Better far than a metaphor

Can ever, ever be.

Love! You are love!

My mystery of love!



If the world was like an iceberg,

And everything was frozen,

And tears turned into icicles in the eye!

And snow came pouring

And sleet and ice

Came stabbing like a knife!

Then you are heat!

A fire alive with heat!

A flame that thaws the iceberg with its heat!



Repeat!



You are heat!



Ah ah ah ah aaaaaaaaaaa!



Love! (I am love!)

You are love! (I am love!)

Better far than a metaphor

Can ever, ever be.

Love! (I am love!)

You are love! (I am love!)

My mystery (His mystery)

Of love!



You are Polaris,

The one trustworthy star.

You are! (I am!)

You are! (I am!)



You are September,

A special mystery

To me! (To he!)

To me! (To he!)



You are sunlight! Moonlight!

Mountains! Valleys!

The microscopic inside of a leaf!

My joy! (Yes, I am his joy!)

My grief! (Yes, I am his grief!)

My star! (Yes, I am his star!)

My leaf! (Yes, I am his leaf!)



Oh. Love! (I am love!)

You are love! (I am love!)

Better far than a metaphor

Can ever, ever be.

Love! (I am love!)

You are love! (I am love!)

My mystery (His mystery)

Of love...

Love...

Love...!
