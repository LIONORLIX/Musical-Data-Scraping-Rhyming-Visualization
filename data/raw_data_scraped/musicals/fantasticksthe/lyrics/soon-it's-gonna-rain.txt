Soon It's Gonna Rain


Hear how the wind begins to whisper.

See how the leaves go streaming by.

Smell how the velvet rain is falling,

Out where the fields are warm and dry.

Now is the time to run inside and stay.

Now is the time to find a hideaway

Where we can stay.



Soon it's gonna rain.

I can see it.

Soon it's gonna rain.

I can tell.

Soon it's gonna rain.

What are we gonna do?



Soon it's gonna rain.

I can feel it.

Soon it's gonna rain.

I can tell.

Soon it's gonna rain.

What'll we do with you?



We'll find four limbs of a tree.

We'll build four walls and a floor.

We'll bind it over with leaves,

And run inside to stay.



Then we'll let it rain.

We'll not fell it.

Then we'll let it rain,

Rain pell-mell.



And we'll not complain

If it never stops at all.

We'll live and love

Within our own four walls.



We'll find four limbs of a tree.

We'll build four walls and a floor.

We'll bind it over with leaves,

And run inside to stay.



Soon it's gonna rain.

Come run inside to stay!

Soon it's gonna rain.

For soon it's gonna rain.

I can see it.

I can feel it.

Run inside and...



Then we'll let it rain.

We'll not feel it.

Then we'll let it rain.

Ran pell-mell.



And we'll not complain

- Happy ending...

If it never stops at all.

Then we'll let it rain.

Why complain?



We'll live and love within our walls.

Happily we'll live and love,

No cares at all.

Happily we'll live and love

Within our castle walls.
