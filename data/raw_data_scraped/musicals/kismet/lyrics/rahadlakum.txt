Rahadlakum


On days when my lord feeleth restless

And bored with his sword and his plume

His handmaiden hath what he needeth

And what doth he need?



Rahadlakume!



On nights when my lord looketh listless

And black is the hue of his gloom

His handmaiden hath what he lacketh

And what doth he lack?



Rahadlakume!



Tis sweet with the meat of a lichee nut

Combined with a kumquat rind

The kind of confection to drive a man out of his Mesopotamian mind



And lo, if my lord feeleth faithless

And wanders by night from his room

His handmaiden fanneth her fires

And out of the pan rises a tantalizing perfume



He scenteth the scent

He turneth his face

His previous place, in her embrace

He does resume



And love is in bloom

The while they consume



Rahadlakume!
