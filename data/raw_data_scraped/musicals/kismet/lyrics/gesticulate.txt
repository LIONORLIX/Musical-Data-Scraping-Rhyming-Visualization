Gesticulate


When you tell a story

Amorous or gory

You can tell it best if you gesticulate



Suppose the mighty Sinbad

Meets a Djinn who's been bad

They can guess the rest if you gesticulate



A tongue is a tongue

And a lung is a lung

In a tale you can shout or sing

Without the gesture? Nothing!



Should Scherazade

Undulate her body

That can be expressed if you gest...

Can be assessed if you gest...

She'll be undressed if you gesticulate



If I tell you I was walking by the sea

and found a genie in a bottle, that's trite!



Right! For practically everyone has seen a genie someone had to throttle...in a bottle!



Right! But if I say the bottle was soooo teeny

And sooooo was the genie



Until with trembling hand, I pulled the cork

And threw the jug and covered up my eyes



And the smoke began to curl

And the smoke began to swirl

And it curled and it swirled

And it swirled and it curled

As higher it did rise

Till it was sooooo high

And soooo was the genie

Then two great arms reached down

And liftd me up, up, up

Into the sky



And we did fly, the genie and I

We did sail, did sail....



Is this a tale? This is a tale!

Are you impressed? We are impressed!



You see, you see, you seeeeee



For the facile finger

Listeners will linger

They will be impressed if you gest...

Applaud with zest if you gest...

If it's a question of a story, gory, Sinbad, Djinn bad, bottle, smoke, genie, arms, fly, high, sky..

I state, reiterate, gesticulate

With your hands!
