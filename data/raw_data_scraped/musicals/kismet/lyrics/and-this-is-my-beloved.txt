And This Is My Beloved


Dawn's promising skies

Petals on a pool drifting

Imagine these in one pair of eyes

And this is my beloved



Strange spice from the south

Honey through the comb sifting

Imagine these in one eager mouth

And this is my beloved



And when s/he speaks and when s/he talks to me

Music! Mystery!

And when s/he moves And when s/he walks with me

Paradise comes suddenly near



All that can stir All that can stun

All that's for the heart's lifting

Imagine these in one perfect one



And this is my beloved

And this is my beloved
