Was I Wazir?


When we caught the seven hundred men

And hung them in their prison pen,

Who said, "Suspend them by their fuzz"?

Was I Wazir? I was!

(Was he Wazir? He was!)



When the keeper of the royal zoo

Was short a cockatoo or two,

Who sealed him in a pot of glue?

Was I Wazir? I was!



(Was he Wazir? He was!

He has a way of learning what he wants to know,

Delicate, but to the point!)



They always seem to remember

When I begin to dismember them

Arm by arm and ear by ear and joint by joint!



When the court musician lost his grasp

And let his lute begin to rasp,

Who had him bitten by an asp?

Was I Wazir?

(Was he Wazir?)

Was I Wazir?

(Was he Wazir?)

I was!



The time we caught the man who said I wasn't nice

(Joy oh joy,

That was a time!)

I confiscated his mother

And then did something or other

Involving her dissolving

In a vat of lime!



When at last, in manner neat and deft,

I've hacked and hatcheted and cleft,

Until no-one but me is left,

I want it clear-

(He wants it clear)

I WAS Wazir!



(And IS Wazir

In every single charming and disarming

Thing he does!)

Was I Wazir?

(Wazir he was!)

I was!
