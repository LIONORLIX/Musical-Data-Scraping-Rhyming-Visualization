The Olive Tree


A fool sat beneath an olive tree

And a wondrous thought had he,

So he rose and he told it to the sky,

And where was I? Behinfd the tree,

I overheard his reverie.



"Why be content with an olive when you could have the tree ?

Why be content to be nothing, when there's nothing you couldn't be ?

Why be contented with one olive tree when you could have the whole olive grove ?

Why be content with a grove when you could have the world ?"



The fool stood beneath the olive tree

"What a wondrous thought" said he

"But alas, it is very, very deep"

And so he yawned and went to sleep,

Because you see, he was a fool!



Why be content with an olive when you could have the tree?

That which has lulled you to sleep fool, has awakened me.

Why should I sigh that my lot is my lot, that I can't make it anything more,

When that is a lie, an excuse for a fool to snore.



I walked from behind the olive tree

With a wondrous change in me,

For I walked with my eye upon a Star.

If you have heard and do not heed

There is a word for what you are,

And oh my friend, the word is Fool!
