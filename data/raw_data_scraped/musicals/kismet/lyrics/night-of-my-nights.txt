Night Of My Nights


Play on the cymbal, the timbal, the lyre;

Play with appropriate passion.

Fashion songs of delight and delicious desire

For the night of my nights.

Come where the so well beloved is waiting,

Where the rose and the jasmine mingle

While I tell her the moon is formating

And 'tis sin to be single!

Let peacocks and monkeys in purple adornings

Show her the way to my bridal chamber,

Then get you gone 'til the morn of my mornings

After the night of my nights!

'Tis the night of my nights!

'Tis the night of my nights!
