Angelina Baker


Way down on de old plantation

Dah’s where I was born,

I used to beat de whole creation

Hoein in de corn;

Oh! den I work and den I sing

So happy all de day,

Till Angelina Baker came

And stole my heart away.



Angelina Baker! Angelina Baker’s gone

She left me here to weep a tear

And beat on de old jawbone.



I’ve seen my Angelina

In de spring-time and de fall,

I’ve seen her in de corn-field

And I’ve seen her at de ball;

And ebry time I met her

She was smiling like de sun,

But now I’m left to weep a tear

Cayse Angelina’s gone.



Angelina Baker! Angelina Baker’s gone

She left me here to weep a tear

And beat on de old jawbone.



Angelina am so tall

She nebber sees de ground,

She hab to take a wellumscope

To look down on de town

Angelina likes de boys

As far as she can see dem,

She used to run old Massa round

To ax him for to free dem.



Angelina Baker! Angelina Baker’s gone

She left me here to weep a tear

And beat on de old jawbone.



Early in de morning

Ob a lubly summer day

I ax for Angelina,

And dey say “she’s gone away”

I don’t know wha to find her,

Cayse I don’t know wha she’s gone,

She left me here to weep a tear

And beat on de old jawbone.



Angelina Baker! Angelina Baker’s gone

She left me here to weep a tear

And beat on de old jawbone.
