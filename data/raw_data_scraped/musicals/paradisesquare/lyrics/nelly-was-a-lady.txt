Nelly was a Lady


Down on the Mississippi floating,

Long time I travel on the way.

All night the cottonwood a-toting,

Sing for my true love all the day.



Now I’m unhappy, and I’m weeping,

Can’t tote the cottonwood no more;

Last night, while Nelly was a-sleeping,

Death came a-knocking at the door.



Nelly was a lady.

Last night, she died.

Toll the bell for lovely Nell,

My dark Virginny bride.



When I saw my Nelly in the morning,

Smile till she opened up her eyes,

Seemed like the light of day a-dawning,

Just ‘fore the sun begin to rise.



Down in the meadow, ‘mong the clover,

Walk with my Nelly by my side;

Now all them happy days are over,

Farewell, my dark Virginny bride.



Nelly was a lady.

Last night, she died.

Toll the bell for lovely Nell,

My dark Virginny bride.
