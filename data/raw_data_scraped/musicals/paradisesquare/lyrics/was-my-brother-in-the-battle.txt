Was My Brother In The Battle


(Verse 1)

Tell me, tell me, weary soldier from the rude and stirring wars

Was my brother in the battle where you gained those noble scars?

He was ever brave and valiant, and I know he never fled

Was his name among the wounded or numbered with the dead?

Was my brother in the battle when the tide of war ran high?

You would know him in a thousand by his dark and flashing eye



(Chorus)

Tell me, tell me, weary soldier, will he never come again

Did he suffer ‘mid the wounded, did he die among the slain?



(Verse 2)

Was my brother in the battle when the noble Highland host

Were so wrongfully outnumbered on the Carolina coast?

Did he struggle for the Union ‘mid the thunder and the rain

Till he fell among the brave upon a bleak Virginia plain?

Oh, I’m sure that he was dauntless and his courage ne’er would lag

While contending for the honor of our dear and cherished flag



(Chorus)

Tell me, tell me, weary soldier, will he never come again

Did he suffer ‘mid the wounded, did he die among the slain?



(Verse 3)

Was my brother in the battle when the flag of Erin came

To the rescue of our banner and protection of our fame

While the fleet from off the waters poured out terror and dismay

Till the bold and erring foe fell like leaves on Autumn day?

When the bugle called to battle and the cannon deeply roared

Oh! I wish I could have seen him draw his sharp and shining sword

(Chorus)

Tell me, tell me, weary soldier, will he never come again

Did he suffer ‘mid the wounded, did he die among the slain?
