Ah! May the Red Rose Live Alway!


Ah! May the red rose live alway

To smile upon the earth and sky

Why should the beautiful ever weep?

Why should the beautiful die?



Lending a charm to every ray

That falls on her cheeks of light

Giving the zephyr kiss for kiss

And nursing the dewdrop bright



Ah! May the red rose live alway

To smile upon the earth and sky

Why should the beautiful ever weep?

Why should the beautiful die?



Long may the daisies dance the field

Frolicking far and near

Why should the innocent hide their heads?

Why should the innocent fear?



Spreading their petals in mute delight

When morn in its radiance breaks

Keeping a floral festival

Till the night-loving primrose wakes



Long may the daisies dance the field

Frolicking far and near

Why should the innocent hide their heads?

Why should the innocent fear?

Lulled be the dirge in the cypress bough

That tells of departed flowers

Ah! that the butterfly's gilded wing

Fluttered in evergreen bowers!



Sad is my heart for the blighted plants

Its pleasures are aye as brief

They bloom at the young yearâ€™s joyful call

And fade with the autumn leaf



Ah! May the red rose live alway

To smile upon the earth and sky

Why should the beautiful ever weep?

Why should the beautiful die?
