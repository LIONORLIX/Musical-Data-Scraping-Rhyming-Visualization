We Are Coming Father Abraham


We are coming, Father Abraham, three hundred thousand more

From Mississippi's winding stream and from New England's shore

We leave our plows and workshops, our wives and children dear

With hearts too full for utterance, with but a silent tear

We dare not look behind us but steadfastly before

We are coming, Father Abraham, three hundred thousand more

We are coming, we are coming our union to restore

We are coming, Father Abraham with three hundred thousand more

We are coming, Father Abraham with three hundred thousand more

If you look across the hilltops that meet the northern sky

Long moving lines of rising dust your vision may descry

And now the wind, an instant, tears the cloudy veil aside

And floats aloft our spangled flag in glory and in pride

And bayonets in the sunlight gleam, and bands brave music pour

We are coming, father Abr'am, three hundred thousand more

We are coming, we are coming our union to restore

We are coming, Father Abraham with three hundred thousand more

We are coming, Father Abraham with three hundred thousand more
