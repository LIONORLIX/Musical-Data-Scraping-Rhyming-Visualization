Oh! Susanna


Oh I come from Alabama

With a banjo on my knee

I'm going to Louisiana

My true love for to see

It rained all night the day I left

The weather it was dry

The sun so hot I froze myself

Susanna, don't you cry



Oh! Susanna

Oh! don't you cry for me

For I come from Alabama

With my banjo on my knee



I had a dream the other night

When everything was still

I thought I saw Susanna

Coming down the hill

The buckwheat cake was in her mouth

The tear was in her eye

I said I'm coming from the South

Susanna don't you cry



Oh! Susanna

Oh! don't you cry for me

For I come from Alabama

With my banjo on my knee

Oh I soon will be in New Orleans and then I'll look around

And when I find my Susanna, I'll fall upon the ground

But if I do not find her, this man will surely die

And when I'm dead and buried, Susanna don't you cry



Oh! Susanna

Oh! don't you cry for me

For I come from Alabama

With my banjo on my knee
