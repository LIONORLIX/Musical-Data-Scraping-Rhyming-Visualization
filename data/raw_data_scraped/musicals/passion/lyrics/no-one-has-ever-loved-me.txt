No One Has Ever Loved Me


Giorgio

No one has ever loved me

As deeply as you.

No one has truly shown me

What love could be like until now:



Not pretty or safe or easy

But more than I ever knew.

Love within reason -

That isn't love.

And I've learned that from you...

Are you cold?

Fosca

No, I'm afraid.

Giorgio

Of what?

Fosca

All this happiness,

Coming when there's so little time.

Too much happiness

More than I can bear.

I pray for the strength to enjoy it.

You'll leave tomorrow.

This is the only time we have.

You do love me, don't you?

Giorgio

Yes, I love you.

Fosca

Say it again.

Giorgio

I love you.

Fosca

Once more.

Giorgio

I love you.

Be calm. Be strong. I am yours.

Fosca

This isn't a dream?

Giorgio

This isn't a dream.

(She begins to lead him towards the bed but Giorgio resists)

No, Fosca, we can't.

Fosca

To die loved is to have lived.

(They kiss. Fosca becomes weak, and Giorgio lifts

her and carries her to the bed where he gently puts

her down. He stares at her momentarily; her strength

returns and she pulls him onto the bed as the music

swells and the lights fade.)
