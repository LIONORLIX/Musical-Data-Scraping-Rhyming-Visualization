Finale


Barri, Rizzolli, Torasso

The town, it is remore, isn't it?

And provincial -

Don't you think?

Clara

I'm filling up our room,

Our little room,

With every flower in bloom.

I'll have the fire lit,

The table set,

I'll wear the blue chemise...

Ludovic

The time has come to face the truth

Signorina...

Attendants This sterile little town

These pompous little men.

Lombardi, Augenti, Soldier 1

This military madness...

Attendants Military madness...

Lombardi, Augenti, Attendants

Uniforms, uniforms...

Clara

Imagining your fingers touching mine

Imagining our room

The bed, the secrecy

The world outside

Your mouth on mine...

Colonel

An unattractive woman

Is easily deceived...

Doctor

What is the cost of a few words when a life hangs in the balance?



(Giorgio picks up Fosca's letter,

opens it and starts to read)

Giorgio

My dearest Giorgio.

The end is near.

The time has come for me to surrender

life gracefully. These past two days

since you have left, since we were

together, have been a revelation.



Now at last I see what comes from feeling loved.

Strange, how merely feeling loved,

Giorgio, Fosca

You see things clearly.

Things I feared, like the world itself,

I now love dearly.

I want to live.

Now I want to live,

Fosca

Just from being loved.

All that pain I nursed inside

For all those years -

Giorgio

All that vain and bitter self-concern -

Both

All those tears and all that pride

Have vanished into air...

Fosca

I don't want to leave.

Giorgio

Now that I am loved.

Fosca

I don't want to leave.

Both

Everywhere I turn, you are there.

Fosca

Everywhere I look things are different.

Both

Everything seems right

Everythings seems possible,

Every moment bursts with feeling.

Why is love so easy to give

And so hard to receive?

Fosca

But though I want to live,

I now can leave

With what I never knew:

I'm someone to be loved.

Giorgio

I'm someone to be loved.

Fosca

And that I learned from you.

All

I don't know how I let you

So far inside my mind.

But there you are and there you will stay

How could I ever wish you away?

I see now I was blind.

Fosca

And should you die tomorrow,

Another thing I see:

Giorgio

Your love will live in me...

Fosca

Your love will live in me...

Giorgio, Group 1

Your love will live in me...

Fosca, Group 2

Your love will live in me...

Giorgio, Group 1

Your love will live in me...

Fosca, Group 2

Your love will live in me...

Giorgio, Group 1

Your love will live in me...

Fosca, Group 2

Your love will live in me...

Giorgio

Your love will live in me...

Fosca

Your love will live in me...

Giorgio

Your love will live in me...
