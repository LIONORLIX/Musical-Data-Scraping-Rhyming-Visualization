Transition 5


Woman

How long were we apart...

Man

A month, a week, a day?

Woman

To feel your touch again...

Both

You've never been away...

(Lights up on the courtyard where

Giorgio is met by the Doctor.)

Doctor

Captain Bachetti, what are you doing here?

You're supposed to be in Milan.

Giorgio

I decided to forgo my sick leave.

Doctor

Has Signora Fosca brought you to this?

Giorgio

Not at all. This was my decision.

Doctor

Don't you see what she's doing to you? To your mental state?

That woman can be insidious.

Giorgio

Then why did you bring her into my life?

Doctor

I thought it would help her. I thought it would bring her

some small degree of happiness... I had no intention for

it to turn to this. Honestly, I didn't. I apologize.

Giorgio

Excuse me, I have things to do.

(Walks away)

Doctor

Captain Bachetti, you seem to forget that I am your superior.

You can't decide to forgo a sick leave just like that. Come on,

my boy. Christmas is just a few days. Don't be foolish, go to

Milan. Take the time you need to be yourself again.

Giorgio

I intend to spend Christmas here. Thank you.

Doctor

You don't seem to understand, Captain. I can see to it that you

are transferred permanently. If I send a dispatch to headquarters,

you'll be ordered to leave.

Giorgio

No! I don't wish to be transferred!

Doctor

Why are you behaving this way?

Giorgio

I feel it my duty to help her.

Doctor

Don't you understand? No one can help her. Good day.
