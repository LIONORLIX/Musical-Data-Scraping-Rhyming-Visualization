Happiness


Clara

(quietly)

I'm so happy, I'm afraid I'll die

Here in your arms

What would you do if I died like this -

(She languishes across him)

Right now, here in your arms?

That we ever should have met

Is a miracle

Giorgio

No, inevitable -

Clara

Then inevitable, yes,

But I confess it was the look

Giorgio

The look?

Clara

The sadness in your eyes

That day when we glanced at each other

In the park.

Giorgio

We were both unhappy.

Clara

Unhappiness can be seductive.

Giorgio

You pitied me...

Both

How quickly pity leads to love.

Clara

All this happiness

Merely from a glance in the park

So much happiness, so much love...

Giorgio

I thought I knew what love was.

Clara

I wish we might have met so much sooner

I could have given you -

Giorgio

I thought I knew what love was.

Clara

- my youth.

Giorgio

I thought I knew how much I could feel.

Clara

All the time we lost...

Giorgio

I didn't know what love was.

Clara

I've never known what love was.

Giorgio

But now -

Clara

And now -

Both

- I do.

It's what I feel with you,

The happiness I feel with you.

Clara

So much happiness -

Giorgio

You are so beautiful...

Clara

- happening by chance in a park.

Giorgio

Not by chance, by necessity -

Clara

Surely, this is happiness -

Giorgio

- by the sadness that we saw in each other.

Clara

- no one else has ever felt before!

Both

Just another love story, that's what they would claim.

Another simple love story - aren't all of them the same?

Clara

No, but this is more, we feel more!

Both

This is so much more!

(Smiling at each other)

Like every other love story.

Some say happiness comes and goes.

then this happiness is a kind of happiness

No one really knows.

Giorgio

I thought I knew what love was.

Clara

I'd only heard what love was.

Giorgio

I thought it was no more than a name for yearning.

Clara

I thought it was what kindness became.

Giorgio

I'm learning -

Clara

I thought where there was love there was shame.

Giorgio

- that with you -

Clara

But with you -

Both

- there's just happiness.

Clara

Endless happiness...

(Music continues underneath as they lie silently

next to each other for a long moment)

What?

Giorgio

Not now...

Clara

Tell me... please.

Giorgio

I received my orders from headquarters.

I've been transferred to the Fourth Brigade.

Clara

(sad)

When?

Giorgio

I leave in five days.

(Clara takes this news in, then slowly

reaches for her chemise)

Clara, don't look so sad.

Clara

You're the one that makes me happy.

Giorgio

We'll make the most of the next four days. I'll steal as

much time as I can. Then after I leave, we'll write to

each other ever day. We'll make love with our words.

You'll be with me ever day, Clara.

(She starts to dress while Giorgio watches her)

Clara

I must go. I'm expected.

Giorgio

God, you are so beautiful.

I love to see you in the light,

Clear and beautiful, memorize

Every inch, every part of you to take with me.

Clara

Giorgio...

Giorgio

Your feet so soft,

As if they'd never touched the ground.

Clara

I must go...

Giorgio

Your skin so white, so pure, so delicate.

Your smell so sweet, your breathe so warm.

I will summon you in my mind,

I'm painting you indelibly on my mind.

Clara

Let me go...

Giorgio

We must fill every moment.

Clara

All this happiness ended by a word in the dark.

Giorgio

Oh my love, oh my darling...

Clara

So much happiness wasn't meant to last.

Giorgio

I am here, I am with you

I am yours.

Clara

I never knew what love was.

Giorgio

Your skin, your silken hair...

Clara

I always thought I didn't deserve it.

Giorgio

Your breasts, your lips...

Clara

I didn't know what love was.

Giorgio

I want you every minute of my life...

Clara

I don't know how I'll live when you're gone!

Giorgio

I will always be here.

Clara

I don't know how I'll live...Giorgio...Don't leave me...

(As they move away from each other, military drums

join the orchestra, quietly at first, then building in

intensity to a climax. This time the drums drown the

orchestra, and we segue into a military formation, which

takes us into the Officers' mess hall)





Scene Two



The dining quarters of the post's commanding officer,

Colonel Ricci. At center is a large dining table.

At the back of the stage is a long staircase which leads

to the living quarters. Around the table sit: Colonel Ricci,

a rather taut gentleman, who carries the weight of his

position with authority and ease; Lieutenant Torasso,

a man often given to laughter and opera singing; Major Rizzolli,

a sober, straight-arrow type; Lieutenant Barri, a veterinarian

with a love of gambling and not much else; and Doctor Tambourri,

a somewhat aloof and distinguished older officer.

As the lights bump up, a Cook (Sergeant Lomabardi)

is overseeing the serving of the meal. Torasso breaks into

an aria from "Rigoletto" while the others talk amongst

themselves, ignoring him. After a beat:



Colonel

(having had enough)

Thank you Lieutenant.

(Torasso stops singing)

Doctor

How was "Rigoletto"?

Torasso

Terrible. These touring companies get no better.

Lombardi

Nor do you.

Torasso

I sing to lighten the weight of your cookings.

Barri

(examining his plate)

Sergeant, what is this?

Lombardi

It's veal.

Barri

Again? We had veal four days ago. And from the

looks of it, it was this veal.

Lombardi

Lieutenant Barri, if I hear -



(They are suddenly interrupted by a woman's distant

scream upstairs. They pause momentarily before resuming

their conversation, as if nothing unusual had occured)



Rizzolli

Colonel, I've heard a rumor that the King is about to

sign a treaty with the French.

Doctor

Really?

Colonel

I've heard no such rumor, Major.

Doctor

Where did you come by this information?

Rizzolli

(uncomfortable)

In town.

Colonel

You can't believe everything you hear in a whorehouse.

Rizzolli

(serious)

That is where Garibaldi got much of his information, sir.

Doctor

Ah, so that's why you go there!

(Giorgio enters)

Colonel

Ah, Captain Bachetti.

Welcome. We wondered when you were going to arrive.

May I introduce Doctor Tambourri, Major Rizzolli...

Torasso

Lieutenant Torasso.

Barri

Lieutenant Barri.

Lombardi

Sergeant Lombardi

Barri

Our cook.

Colonel

Come. Come and join us.

(Giorgio hands a letter to Augenti.)

Giorgio

Could you post this one for me?

(Giorgio sits; to his right remains an

unoccupied chair and place setting)

Lombardi

You'll have to excuse our rather limited menu, Captain.

It's difficult to grow vegetables in this mountain soil.

Doctor

We're a bit isolated here, Captain.

Not only from anything green and edible, but also from life and ideas.

Rizzolli

I just add vinegar to everything

Torasso

Captain Bachetti, the Colonel has been telling us

of your triumphs pinning down the Russian infantry.

Giorgio

I'm not sure that my actions worried your attention.

Torasso

Come, come. Didn't you rescue a wounded man in the midst of

fire and then carry him on your horse to camp?

Giorgio

Only to our battalion.

Barri

Say you brought him back to camp! Why settle for being half

a hero when full-fledged is just a white lie away?

(The lights suddenly bump up; music under, agitated. Clara

enters to the side of the stage, singing from a letter she holds.)
