Loving You


Fosca

Loving you is not a choice,

It's who I am.



Loving you is not a choice

And not much reason to rejoice,

But it gives me purpose

Gives me voice to say to the world:

This is why I live

You are why I live.



Loving you is why I do

The things I do

Loving you is not in my control.

But loving you, I have a goal

For what's left of my life...



I would live,

And I would die for you.

(As music continues under)

Giorgio

Die for me? What kind of love is that?

Fosca

The truest love. Would Clara give her life for you?

Would she? I would. Happily. In time you will come

to see what is beautiful about me. Do you wish me

to move to another compartment?

Giorgio

We're getting off at the next stop and I'm taking

you back. And then I'll go on to Milan.

(getting up)

You must be cold. Here.

(He wraps his blanket around her)

Take this. Can't have you getting more ill, can I?

Fosca

(staring out the window)

The moonlight makes even this landscape look lovely.

Look over there. There seem to be faces in those rocks.

They're smiling back at us.
