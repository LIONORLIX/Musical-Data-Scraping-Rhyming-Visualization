First Letter


Giorgio

Clara...

Clara

Clara...

Giorgio

I cried.

Clara

I cried.

Both

Imagine that, a soldier who cries.

Clara

I had to hide my eyes, so the others on the train

That carried me away from you would think I was asleep.

(a piano sounds offstage)

Giorgio

Music?

Doctor

That's Signora Fosca playing.

Colonel

My cousin. I have no family and neither does she.

She is in such poor health, it's a continual worry.

Doctor

That's her place setting, but she stays in her room most days.

Perhaps soon she'll be well enough to join us for a meal.

Rizzolli

She eats like a sparrow.

(Torasso lets out an involuntary laugh, which is

immediately stopped by a cold stare from the Colonel)

Torasso

(sober)

My apologies, sir.

The comparison has struck me as funny. A sparrow seems

to eat more than Signora Fosca. A pity it is...

Colonel

(to Giorgio)

My cousin loves to read - it's her only passion, really.

I can't find enough books for her.

Giorgio

I also love reading. I've brought a few of my favorite books down.

Perhaps I could lend them to Signora Fosca, though I can't

promise they will appeal to her.

Colonel

Young man, she's been driven to reading military handbooks.

I've no doubt she will welcome anything in print.

(Private Augenti enters and delivers a few

letters, one of which goes to Giorgio)

Augenti

Post arrived!

Rizzolli

Hand it round Augenti.

(surprised)

Nothing for me again? It's been two weeks.

Augenti

It smells to me as if Captain Bachetti has a letter from an admirer.

(Music under; the lights bump up. Clara reappears)
