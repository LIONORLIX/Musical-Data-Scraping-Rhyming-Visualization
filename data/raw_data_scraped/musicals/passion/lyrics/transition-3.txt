Transition 3


Attendants

I've watched you from my window

I saw you on the day that you arrived.

Perhaps it was the way you walked.

The way you spoke to your men.

You were different then,

You were kind and good.

I thought you understood...





Scene Six

Fosca's drawing room.

Fosca sits doing needlepoint. She appears even

sicker than usual. An attendant goes off and

returns with Giorgio. Fosca greets Giorgio

with a cold smile and signals the attendant to leave.



Giorgio

You sent for me.

Fosca

I received your letter and I thank you.

I hope we can still shake hands.

(She extands her hand to him)

Giorgio

Yes, of course. We can certainly be friends.

Fosca

You have no idea how mortified I am.

Giorgio

Mortified?

Fosca

About everything that has happened. My emotions

sometimes overpower my judgement.

Giorgio

I found your affection very flattering.

Fosca

How indulgent you are with me. Did you amuse yourself in Milan?

Giorgio

Very much.

Fosca

Admit that you only took leave to visit my rival.

Giorgio

Your rival?

Yes, of course that was the purpose of my visit.

Fosca

Excuse me. I can be very naive sometimes.

I should have understood what you meant by

your "urgent need to leave".

Will you be going back soon?

Giorgio

Whenever I can. As soon as possible.

Fosca

If you get another leave.

Giorgio

Naturally.

Fosca

Perhaps I should put in a word to my cousin. My help

might serve you well. On the other hand, a negative word...

Giorgio

Place more value on your dignity.

Don't offend your pride, Signora.

Fosca

We each deal with our pride as best we can.

Do you love this woman very much?

Giorgio

I wrote to you.

Fosca

Is she beautiful?

Giorgio

As an angel.

Fosca

Then why don't you marry her?

Giorgio

She is already married.

Fosca

And you respect her.

Giorgio

You can't love someone without respecting.

Fosca

That's not true, but it hardly matters.

And is your angel also a mother?

Giorgio

Let's stop torturing each other like this.

It's humiliating and degrading. I find your

sarcasm most distasteful.

Fosca

I have many flaws, Captain.

Giorgio

Our situation is well-defined. Let's not

discuss this subject again.

Fosca

That is what I would like.

Giorgio

Good. Perhaps we should have no further

occasion to speak of ourselves.

Fosca

You may also hope that we do not see each other again.

Giorgio

Yes, that might be very well the best course of action.

Fosca

You may go now, Captain. I have more important things to do.

(Giorgio clicks his heels and exits.

As Clara walks through, reading a letter.

We segue to the Doctor's office)
