Giorgio

How can I describe her?

The wretchedness, God, the wretchedness

And the suffering, the desperation

Of that poor unhappy creature -

The embarrassment, Clara.

Looking at that lonelyness,

Listening to all that self-pity...

(Another formation of Soldiers

takes us to the Garden)

Soldiers

The town -

It is remote, isn't it?

And provincial, don't you think?



And everything so brown:

The streets, the fields, the river even.

Of course there is the castle,

The ruined castle...



Scene Three

The castle garden.

The Colonel, the Doctor and Fosca enter

and stroll through the garden down to

Giorgio; music continues underneath.
