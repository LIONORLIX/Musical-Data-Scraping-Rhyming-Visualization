Colonel

Captain, I cannot thank you enough.

Your kindness to my cousin have meant a great deal.

Giorgio

You have no reason to thank me.

Colonel

Any attention that is paid to her means so much.

Signora Fosca has always had a shortage of friends.



(Fosca is revealed at her writing table)

Fosca

My dearest Giorgio. I am writing you even though the

Doctor has forbidden it. What a joy to have someone

to whom I can tell my feelings. To share my past.

Colonel

I was a young man when my parents died. And Fosca's

mother and father welcomed me into their house

whenever I was on leave.

(Music under as we go back in time)

As a child -

Fosca

As a child -

Colonel

She was lonely -

Fosca

I was happy -

Colonel

Her parents doted on her -

Fosca

My parents doted on me -



(Fosca's Mother and Father enter)

Both

They said:

Mother, Father

Beautiful.

Mother

So sensitive.

Mother, Father

So beautiful.

Fosca

They told me to be:

Mother

Careful -

Colonel

Of course -

Mother

- Fosca.

Colonel

- to them she was.

Father

A girl as beautiful as you are has to

Fosca

And so -

Father

- be careful.

Fosca

- I thought

That I was beautiful.

Fosca, Colonel

And then she (I) reached the age

Where being beautiful

Becomes the most important thing

A woman can be.

Colonel

An unattractive man -

Fosca

As long as you're a man,

You still have opportunities.

Colonel

- can still have opportunities.

Mother, Father

Beautiful...

Colonel, Fosca

Whereas, if you're a woman

You either are

a daughter or a wife.

Mother, Father

A woman is a flower.

Fosca, Colonel

You marry -

Father

- you're seventeen.

Colonel

- or you're a daughter

all your life.

Mother, Father

Now is the hour...

Colonel

I'd met this nice young man.

Fosca

I'd seen this nice young man -

Colonel

He'd introduced himself -

Fosca

- passing by -

Colonel

- at my club.

Fosca

- just below my window.

Colonel

So -

Fosca

One day -

Colonel

- one evening I invited him -

Fosca

- he tipped his hat to me.

Colonel

- home.

Count Ludovic -

Fosca

I must admit that I was flattered -

Colonel

- this is my Aunt Theresa and my Uncle Bruno.

Mother, Father

A count?

Father

From where, if I may ask.

Ludovic

Austria.

Father, Mother

Austria...

Mother

What a beautiful place.

Colonel

Fosca, we have a visitor!

Fosca

Imagine my surprise...

Colonel

I'd like you to meet a new friend. Count Ludovic.

Fosca

He was even more handsome up close.

Colonel

I was amazed to see the Count take such an interest in my cousin.

Ludovic

If I had know you where here, Signorina -

Fosca

"If he had known..." Of course he knew.

Ludovic

- I would have brought you many flowers.

Colonel

If I had known...

Ludovic

You do like flowers?

Fosca

Yes.

Colonel

I should have known.

Ludovic

I've seen you at your window.

Mother

Won't you stay for dinner?

Father

Do. Yes.

Ludovic

I've watched you every day since I arrived.

Fosca

I had my suspicion.

Colonel

I had no suspicion.

Fosca, Colonel

I chose not to see.

Ludovic

The way you move,

The way you gaze at the sky...

Fosca

For love had made me blind -

Colonel

How could I be so blind?

Fosca

- or what I took for love.

Colonel

Within a month, he had asked for her hand.

Giorgio

Signora Fosca has been married?

Colonel

Yes.

Father, Mother

Austria... Count Ludovic of Austria...

Fosca

I sensed in him a danger,

Deception, even violence.

I must admit to some degree

That it excited me.

Father, Mother

Austria... Count Ludovic of Austria...

Colonel

Once they were married, once he'd received

my uncle's sizable dowry, he traveled a great

deal, was unavailable to Fosca.

Fosca

He gambled away the dowry. I was forced to go

to my parents to borrow from what little savings

they had left.

Colonel

Then one day, as she was coming from market...

Mistress

Excuse me. You're the wife of a Count Ludovic ?

Fosca

Yes.

Mistress

You fool.

The man's a fraud, a fake.

The trips he said he had to take abroad

He took them so that he could be with me.

He calls himself a Count, but he's not.

He's never had a title in his life!

He doesn't have a title,

But he does have a wife

And a child in Dalmatia.

Fosca

No, you must be mistaken.

Mistress

Oh, yes.

He only wants to bleed you

Until the day he doesn't need you.

I warn you he'll abandon you

As he abandoned her and me

And countless others, I've no doubt.

I'm telling you, the man was born without a heart.

You fool...

Fosca

I confronted him with this information, and

he made no attempt to deny it.

Ludovic

A well, at last you know the truth, Signorina.

But you as well must face the truth.

I've no desire to deceive you any more.

But do admit what you ignore:

We made a bargain, did we not?

And we got what we bargained for.



You gave me your money, I gave you my looks

And my charm and my arm.

I would say that more than balances the books.

Now it's done

Where's the harm?



If women sell their looks,

Why can't a man, if he can?

Besides, the money wasn't even yours,

It belonged to those ridiculous old bores,

Your parents.

Forgive me, my dear, but though you are no beauty,

I fear, you are not quite the victim you appear.



Well, let us part by mutual consent and be content.

And so good luck and goodbye.

I must go.

Oh, and yes, we haven't paid the rent

Since July...

Just so you know...

Fosca

I returned home, to find my parents impoverished and in poor health.

Colonel

Fosca's health failed...

Fosca

A woman's like a flower...

Colonel

She began to suffer her first convulsions.

My aunt and uncle nursed her as best they could.

Fosca

A flower's only purpose is to please...

Colonel

I spent months looking for the man.

Fosca

Beauty is power...

Colonel

By then, of course, he'd vanished.

Fosca

Longing a disease...

Colonel

To this day, I dream of finding him and realizing my revenge.

Fosca

My father died not long thereafter.

Colonel

How could I be so blind?

Fosca

I couldn't face the world.

Colonel

It took her many months to leave her bed.

Fosca

It took me months to leave my bed.

Colonel

When her mother died, she had nothing really.

No one.

Fosca

And so I went to stay with my cousin, who in

some way felt responsible for my circumstances.

Colonel

Why could I not admit the truth?

How could I not have seen through the veneer?

I told myself,

"As long as she seems happy, why interfere?"

Or was I just relieved to know

That somebody would want her for a wife?

In war you know the enemy,

Not always so in life.



The enemy was love -

Selfishness really, but love,

All of us blinded by love

That makes everything seem possible.



You have to pay a consequence

For things that you've denied.

This is the thorn in my side.

Mistress

As long as you're a man,

You're what the world will make of you.

Mistress, Mother

Whereas if you're a woman,

You're only what it sees.

Colonel, Father, Ludovic

A woman is a flower whose purpose is to please.

All

Beauty is power, longing a disease...

enters in a robe, her hair down)
