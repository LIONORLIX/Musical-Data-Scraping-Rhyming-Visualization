Is This What You Call Love?


Giorgio

Is this what you call love?

This endless and insatiable

Smothering pursuit of me.

You think that this is love?



I'm sorry that you're lonely,

I'm sorry that you want me as you do.

I'm sorry that I fail to feel

The way you want me to feel.



I'm sorry that you're ill,

I'm sorry you're in pain.

I'm sorry that you aren't beautiful.



But yes, I wish you'd go away

And leave me alone!



Everywhere I turn, there you are

This is not love

Just some kind of obsession.



Will you never learn when too far is too far,

Have you no concern

For what I want, what I feel?

(pointing at Clara's letter)

Love is what you earn and return

When you care for another

So much that the other's set free.

Don't you see?

Can't you understand?



Love's not a constant demand,

It's a gift you bestow

Love isn't sudden surrender

It's tender and slow, it must grow.



Yet everywhere I go,

You appear or I know you are near

This is now love just a need for possession.



Call it what you will

This is not love, this is a reverse

Like a curse, something out of control

I've begun to fear

For my soul...

(Music stops; a loud clap of thunder is heard.

Trembling, Fosca sudders momentarily and crumples

to the ground. Giorgio turns and sees her lying

there; he crosses the stage past her and begins

to exit. He stops, pauses for a moment, then

reluctantly returns to her, covering her with

his coat. He picks her up and carries her offstage

as the lights fade to black.)

Outside. The soldiers are on guard.
