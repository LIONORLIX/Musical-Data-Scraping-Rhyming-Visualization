Second Letter


Clara

Giorgio...

I, too, have cried inside.

Both

You must not be ashamed of your tears.

Clara

I love you for your tears.

Both

Your absence only makes my love grow stronger.

And when I cannot bear it any longer -



(We hear another scream come from upstairs.

Music stops as Giorgio rises, concerned; the

others continue to eat, unfazed.)



Colonel

Don't be alarmed. It's my cousin. I am so accustomed to her

outbursts that I forget how unsettling they must be to a newcomer.

My apologies for not warning you.

Doctor

She's not been having a good day. And a doctor is always expected

to help hurt, even when there is nothing one can possibly do.

Torasso

More lamb please.

Doctor

(to Lombardi)

I've noticed you finally managed to track down some tarragon.

Lombardi

Yes, I'm glad you approved...

(Another scream; the Colonel looks to the Doctor)

Colonel

Doctor.

Doctor

Excuse me.

(He wearily rises and crosses to the stairs, which he climbs.)

Barri

Sergeant, are there any more carrots?

Lombardi

Seconds for you, Lieutenant? Can I take that as a compliment?

Barri

No, Sergeant, they're for my horses.

(Laughter. Torasso gives Giorgio a slap

on the back. Giorgio is not amused.)

Colonel

In time, Captain Bacchetti, you too will get used

to life amongst us.

(Snare drums; everyone gets up. Clara enters while the

soldiers formate to a march. Clara sings from another letter,

accompanied chiefly by drums and sporadic bugle calls)
