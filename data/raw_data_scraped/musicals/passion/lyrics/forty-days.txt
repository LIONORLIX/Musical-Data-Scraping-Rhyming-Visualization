Forty Days


Clara

Giorgio, darling,

Forty days' leave so soon!

Imagine that, a whole forty days -

Well, forty marinees.

I'll be there to greet the train

That carried you away from me

Because it brings you home.



(Giorgio enters slowly. He has a blanket around him

and carries a suitcase as he moves towards the train

compartment where he sits)



I'm filling up the room, our secret room

With every flower in bloom.

I'll have the fire lit, the table set,

I'll wear the blue chemise.



And once we're in our room, our secret room,

Where I'll be able to care for you,

Kiss you, embrace you,

Be there for you...

(She exits. The train whistle blows and, just as the train

start to move, Fosca enters, carrying a small suitcase)

Giorgio

How could you? How dare you follow me?

Fosca

You needn't speak to me. You could pretend that I'm not even here.

Giorgio

I am sick, don't you understand?

Fosca

I understand all too well. I could attend to you.

I could help you get better.

Giorgio

I don't want you to help. You're the reason I'm sick.

Fosca

I apologize. Nothing could be further from what I

wanted for you. That is why I want to follow you to Milan.

To see that you are well.

Giorgio

Fosca, you can't do this.

Fosca

I heard what you said, Giorgio. I've come to tell you that

I will keep my distance. I will stay out of your path. But

I can be nearby, I can be quietly watching.

Giorgio

And you think that this will make me love you?

Fosca

No, no. I am doing this because I love you.

Giorgio

My heart feels nothing for you.

How many times do you have to hear this?

Fosca

This has nothing to do with your heart. This has

to do with your eyes. What you see. If I were

beautiful. If I were warm and soft to your touch -

you would feel otherwise.

Giorgio

(firm)

No. Your appearance is no excuse for the way you behave.

My feelings towards you are because of your relentlessness,

your constant selfishness and insensitivity.

Fosca

I'm sorry. No one has ever told me how to love. I know I

feel too much, Giorgio. I often don't know what to do

with my feelings. You understand that, don't you?

Giorgio

(slowly, pleading)

Fosca, you have to face the truth. Please.

You have to give me up.
