A Quiet Thing


When it all comes true

Just the way you'd planned

It's funny but the bells don't ring

It's a quiet thing



When you hold the world

In your trembling hand

You'd think you'd hear a choir sing

It's a quiet thing



There are no exploding fireworks

Where's the roaring of the crowds

Maybe it's the strange new atmosphere

Way up here among the clouds



But I don't hear the drums

And I don't hear the band

The sounds I'm told

Such moments bring



Happiness comes in on tip-toe

Well, what'd'ya know

It's a quiet thing

A very quiet thing
