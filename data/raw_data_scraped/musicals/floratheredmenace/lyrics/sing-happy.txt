Sing Happy


Sing me a Happy song about Robins in spring

Sing me a happy song

with a happy ending.

Some cheerful rondelet about catching the ring

Sing Happy



Sing me a sonnett all about rolling in gold

Some peppy melody about rainbows blending

Nothing with phrases saying you're out in the cold

Sing Happy



Tell me tomorrow's gonna be peaches and cream

Assure me clouds are lined with a silver lining

Say how you've realized an impossible dream

Sing me a happy song



Play me a madrigal about trips to the moon

Or some old ballad about two eyes shining

It can't be loud enough or a moment too soon

Sing Happy



No need reminding me that it all fell apart

I need no lyrics singing of stormy weather

There's quite enough around me that's breaking my heart

Sing Happy



Give me a hallelujah and get up and shout

Tell me the sun is shining around the corner

Whoever's interested helping me out

Please keep it happy.



I'm only in the market for long loud laughter

I'll let you serenade me till dawn comes along

Just make it a happy

Keep it a happy song.
