Down In New Orleans (Finale)


In the South Land there's a city

Way down on the river

Where the women are very pretty

And all the men deliver



They got music

It's always playin'

Start in the day time, go all through the night



When you hear that music playin'

Hear what I'm saying and make it feel alright



Grab somebody, come on down

Bring your paintbrush, we're painting the town

There's some sweetness going around

Dreams do come true in New Orleans
