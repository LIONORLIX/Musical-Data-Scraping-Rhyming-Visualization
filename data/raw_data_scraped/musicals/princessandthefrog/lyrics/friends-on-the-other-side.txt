Friends On The Other Side


Facilier:

Don't you disrespect me little man!

Don't you derogate or deride!

You're in my world now

Not your world

And I got friends on the other side!



Chorus:

He's got friends on the other side...



Facilier:

That's an echo, gentlemen. Just a little something we have here in Louisiana, a little parlor trick. Don't worry...



Sit down at my table

Put your minds at ease

If you relax it will enable me to do anything I please

I can read your future

I can change it 'round some, too

I'll look deep into your heart and soul

(you do have a soul, don't you, Lawrence?)

Make your wildest dreams come true!



I got voodoo

I got hoodoo

I got things I ain't even tried!

And I got friends on the other side.



Chorus:

He's got friends on the other side!



Facilier:

The cards, the cards, the cards will tell

The past, the present, and the future as well

The cards, the cards, just take three

Take a little trip into your future with me!



Now you, young man, are from across the sea

You come from two long lines of royalty

(I'm a royal myself on my mother's side)

Your lifestyle's high

But your funds are low

You need to marry a little honey whose daddy got dough



Mommy and daddy cut you off, huh playboy?

Now y'all gotta get hitched, but hitchin' ties you down.

You just wanna be free.

Hop from place to place.



But freedom... takes green!

It's the green, it's the green, it's the green you need

And when I looked into your future

It's the green that I see!



On you little man, I don't want to waste much time

You been pushed around all your life

You been pushed around by your mother and your sister and your brother.

And if you was married...

You'd be pushed around by your wife

But in your future, the you I see

Is exactly the man you always wanted to be!



Shake my hand.

Come on boys.

Won't you shake the poor sinner's hand?



Yes...

Are you ready?



Chorus:

Are you ready?



Facilier:

Are you ready?

Transformation central!



Chorus:

Transformation central!



Facilier:

Reformation central!



Chorus:

Reformation central!



Facilier:

Transmogrification central!

Can you feel it?

You're changin'

You're changin'

You're changin', all right!

I hope you're satisfied

But if you ain't

Don't blame me

You can blame my friends on the other side!



Chorus:

You got what you wanted!

But you lost what you had!



Hush...
