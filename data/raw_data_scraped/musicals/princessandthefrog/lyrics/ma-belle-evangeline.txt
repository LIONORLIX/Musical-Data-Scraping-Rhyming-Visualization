Ma Belle Evangeline


RAY



Look how she lights up the sky

Ma belle Evangeline

So far above me yet I

Know her heart belongs to only me



J'adore, J'taime, Evangeline

You're my queen of the night

So still, so bright



To someone as beautiful as she

Who loves someone like me

Love always finds a way, it's true

And I love you Evangeline

(spoken)

Oooh, yeah!



(sung)

Love is beautiful

Love is wonderful

Love is everything, do you agree?

Mais oui!



Look how she lights up the sky

I love you, Evangeline
