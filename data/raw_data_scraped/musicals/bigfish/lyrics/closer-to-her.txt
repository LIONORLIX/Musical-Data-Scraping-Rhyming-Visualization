Closer to Her


(Edward Bloom)

If you tell me who she is

I’ll work night and day

And you won’t even have to pay me



(Amos Calloway)

Okay.



Once a month

If you work

If you slave

If you cry for me

Then I’ll give you a clue



Once a month

If you clean

If you haul

If you die for me

Then the clue will be true



Once a month

It could be what she thinks

What she loves

Where she lives

What she drinks

What she hopes

And all you have to do

Is pull the ropes



Closer to her

I’ll get you closer to her

You only need to be

My devotee because

I’ll tell you where she was born

Or if she plays the French horn

Then you’ll be closer

Than you ever was



First clue: She likes dancing.



(Edward Bloom)

Dancing!



(Circus Folk)

Closer to her

You’re one step closer to her



(Edward Bloom)

I’m not afraid to stoop

To scooping poop because



(Circus Folk)

He’ll stoop for poop!



(Amos Calloway)

You’ll learn what perfume she wears

Or what she says in her prayers



(Edward Bloom)

And be much closer than I ever was



Mr. Calloway, it’s time.



(Amos Calloway)

For what?



(Edward Bloom)

My clue! About the girl I’m gonna marry.



(Amos Calloway)

If you got a clue, you wouldn’t get married at all. Back to work!



(Circus Folk)

Days into weeks

Into months into years

Into clue after clue after clue



(Amos Calloway)

She likes blue!



(Circus Folk)

Seasons go by in the blink of an eye

But the dream doesn’t seem

To come true



(Amos Calloway)

Barbecue!



(Edward Bloom)

Year after year

With the hope I would hear

Something kind

Something fresh

Something new-



Mr. Calloway, it’s been three years!



(Amos Calloway)

Kid! There’s other fish in the seas!



(Edward Bloom)

But I’m already hooked. Why do you insist on keeping her name a secret?



(Amos Calloway)

Secrets are the backbone of society

Everybody ought to have a few

I believe in secrets

And I’ll keep mine for awhile

They keep me a success

They make you work for less



But I’m a man of my word. Your girl- she’s going to college.



(Edward Bloom)

Closer to her



(Edward & Circus Folk)

One textbook closer to her

But I’ve/you’ve been working hard

And time is flying by



(Edward Bloom)

I’ve paid his price, I should go

Still, there’s one thing I don’t know…



(Amos Calloway)

Hell. Her name is Sandra Templeton. She goes to Auburn University.



(Edward Bloom)

Thank you, Mr. Calloway. Thank you!



(Circus Folk)

Like a cannon ball

Soon to be a human comet above

Like a cannon ball

Circling a constellation of love



Filling up the heavens

Making waters part

Aiming straight for

His beloved’s welcoming heart



Boom!



Closer it’s true

There’s not much more he can do

The years gone by will seem

A kind of dreamy blur

And when at Auburn he lands

He’ll do what Fortune demands

When finally closer than closer to-



[A body falls from the sky.]



(Edward Bloom)

Oof!!
