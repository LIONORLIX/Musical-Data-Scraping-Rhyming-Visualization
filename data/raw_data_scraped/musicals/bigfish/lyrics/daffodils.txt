Daffodils


EDWARD:

I was indentured to

A traveling circus

Elephants and all

I was shot out of a cannon

When they up and lost the ball

I met werewolves,

Giants

Dancing bears

If you don’t think it true

Then how on earth

Can you explain the road

That led me here to you?



SANDRA:

[spoken] Wait, are you the…



EDWARD:

Look, I saw you

And all of time

In all the world stood still

And I promise

I’ll prove my worth

I’ll roam the earth until

You believe me

And we can be, at last forever one

Don’t be afraid

Be my crusade



SANDRA:

[spoken] But you’re too late. I’m engaged to be married.



EDWARD:

Tell me what I have to go and do

To make you change your mind

Anything I have to promise to

I’ll gladly get behind

I’m the man who you should marry

Your intended through and through

Otherwise I’d never walk the road

That led me here to you

Once a month

A scrap of news

It felt like you were there

Once a month

I heard your voice

I held you, solitaire



Amos said that you loved music

Said that you were college bound

But one thing,

More than all the rest

Filled the heart inside my chest:



He told me you loved daffodils

And countless as the stars that shine

They stretched in never ending line

‘Til all I saw were



Daffodils

Beside the lake

Beneath the trees

All fluttering and dancing in the breeze



And like that moment right between

Asleep and waking

I thought I saw ten thousand strong

In one quick glance

But when I saw your face

I knew beyond mistaking

A million flowers

Couldn’t stand a chance

So I’ll pretend the



Daffodils

Are just an introduction to

The blossoming of me and you

Beside the lake

Beneath the tree

Beyond mistake

Please marry me

Please marry me



SANDRA:

[spoken] But you hardly know me!



EDWARD:

[spoken] I have the rest of my life to find out.



[spoken] These, and these

[spoken] These, and these…



[sung]

These are for you

Only for you



EDWARD & SANDRA:

Let’s build a world of daffodils

That never fades and never dies

I see the answer in your eyes

You’ll be the bride/I’ll be the bride

I’ll be the groom/you’ll be the groom

A daffodil in every room



EDWARD:

And I will shower you with flowers

Or my name isn’t Edward…



EDWARD & SANDRA:

Bloom
