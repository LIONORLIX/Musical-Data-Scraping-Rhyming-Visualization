Time Stops


[Edward:]

Time stops when suddenly you see her

Time stops and what you thought you knew changes

and life beyond this moment is better, bigger



Time stops but still your heart is beating

Time stops though you don't take a breathe

She's there and all you've ever wanted is nearer, clearer



I used to think the world was small

Now I don't think that way at all



Time stops when dreams come true before you

Time stops when fantasy is real

I knew this moment was expected

But this good, who could?



[Sandra:]

That boy is staring and I feel a chill

I don't know why

That boy is staring and the world is still

Not tumbling by, there's no one talking

But I can hear a thousand voices

What's going on inside me?

That boy is staring is it me he sees?

I can't be sure

If he is staring, should I try to please?

or be demure?

My hand is trembling, but in this moment nothing scares me

What's going on?



[Edward and (Sandra):]

I used to see what lies ahead

(I thought my life might be a bore)

Now I just see this girl instead

(Could be I'm bound for something more)



Time stops (and troubles are abandoned)

Time stops the minute (s)he arrives

I see the future in this instant

Subversive. Sublime.



I'd live forever in this moment

If I could stop, stop time



[Sandra:]

That boy is staring and I feel a chill

I don't know why
