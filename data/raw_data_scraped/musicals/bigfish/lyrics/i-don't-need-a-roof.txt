I Don't Need a Roof


In your face

I see a lifetime.

In this place

I feel at ease.

Wallpaper peeling, paint wearing thin.

Here's where I end and begin

I don’t need a roof to say I’m covered

I don’t need a roof to know I’m home

There could be a single shingle-dangling overhead

I don’t need a roof to make my bed

Close your eyes, I'm still beside you.

No goodbyes needed today

Hear what the rain says,

Know what it knows

After the rain something grows

I don’t need a roof to say I love you

I don’t need a roof to call you mine

I don’t need adventure in some far away frontier

I don’t need a roof to feel you near

All I need is you and you forever

All I feel is true and absolute

I don’t need a legal deed

to help me play my part

I don’t need a roof to hold my heart

Stay with me

Stay with me
