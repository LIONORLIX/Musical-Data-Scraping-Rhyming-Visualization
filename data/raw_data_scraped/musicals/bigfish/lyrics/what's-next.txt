What's Next


WILL



First things first:

We're in this prison cell

Have to find a way

To break out

Find another place

To stake out



Look around

Be sure we aren't seen

Slowly check the door

Before we're spotted

Were we spotted?



I know

You've been

A secret double agent

But we can turn the page

Into another kind of tale



Let's go

The door

Is just our first opponent

So step out of your

State of shock

We only need to

Pick this lock...



EDWARD



(reveals Key to the City)

No need!



WILL



"What's next" is all

Anyone needs to begin

"What's next"

Has been a friend to you

What's next to do?

One word and then

Suddenly one more again

Just like a pen

Writing a perfect tale



Out the door

And pray the coast is clear



DR. BENETT



Edward?



WILL



Noses to the ground

Before we're spotted



EDWARD



We were spotted!



WILL



So, now we face

The ultimate decision Relinquish our control

As we surrender up the fight

Or else we say

Hello to the collision

Just do our job and do it well



EDWARD



Or better yet

Let's run like hell!



WILL



"What's next" is all

Anyone needs to begin

"What's next"

Has been a friend to you

What's next to do?

One word and then

Suddenly one more again

Just like a pen

Writing a perfect tale



EDWARD



Will, look! My old Chevy!



WILL



Edward Bloom

How did you swim through

Danger in the world

What was in the heart that

Beats inside you?

Were you simply wetter than

The ordinary average man

Or was it just your fins and

Scales to guid you to:



What's next



EDWARD



We start the car



WILL



What's next?



EDWARD



We hit the road!



WILL



What's next?



EDWARD



We find the river



WILL



What's next? What's next?



EDWARD



I don't, I don't know...



WILL



And who do we see

At the river

To greet you

Everyone there at the river

To meet you

Everyone you ever knew

Ever spoke of

Waiting for you to arrive



Now, can you see Karl

By the tree in the distance

Amos arrives with his usual flair

Zacky and Don

Gathered 'round, cherring on

Yes, even the Witch is there

She is there!



WILL



"What's next" is all

Anyone needs to begin

"What's next"

Has been a friend to you

What's next to do?



EDWARD'S FRIENDS



Edward Bloom

We've come to say goodbye

Come to tell you why

We've always loved you

Yes, we loved you



WILL



Only one dad

Only inspiring one son

Edward, you're done

Writing your perfect tale

Telling the perfect tale



EVERYONE but EDWARD



It was a perfect tale
