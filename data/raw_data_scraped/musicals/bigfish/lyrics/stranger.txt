Stranger


(Will Bloom)



Stranger



I’m feeling stranger



Than I’ve ever felt before



And so much more



Different



Like something old has joined



With something new



But still feels true







I’m passing through a rite that every parent does



I’m walking on some shared familiar ground



Yet every step I take



Is not a step that was



And I’ve found



I like the sound of







Stranger



A child I’ve yet to meet



Becomes my everything



My song to sing



Father



And suddenly the weight of it is real



What do I feel’



I feel connected



In a way I’ve never known



A line from dad to me to new-born son



So from today



I’ll never make a choice alone



One for all



All for one







And when he’s born



I’ll teach him how to use his common sense



He’ll listen and he’ll learn and he’ll excel



I’ll tell my son



That life is lived in clear and present tense



Not only in the stories we can tell







My father told me stories



I could never comprehend



In every tale he’d claim to be the hero



I’ve tried to understand him



But I wonder if I can



Because after almost thirty years



I still don’t know the man



I wish I knew the man







But he’s a stranger



My father is a stranger I know very well



A puzzling shell



Hopeful



What’s on its way may help us both to grow



But I don’t know







I don’t know when I’ll understand



What made him wild



I don’t know why he has the urge to fly



I want to face him like a man and not a child



So I’ll try



I’ll really try







And in time, my boy is sure to see



Brighter days for dad and me



We can do things better than before



So that strangers we will be no more
