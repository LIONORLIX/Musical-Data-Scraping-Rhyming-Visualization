Start Over


Don price:

Edward’s not a savior

Edward’s not a saint

How can he be good for us?

He’s not the thing he says he ain’t

We can change our fate

You bet we can

We don’t need this interloping man



Edward:

I suggest that you

Start over



Don price:

"now?"



Edward:

Start over



Don price:

"how?"



Edward:

Instead of drown

We move the town

And start over



Townsfolk:

"wow."



Edward

You can sweat

You can fret

‘til we’re all soaking wet

‘cuz good god there’s a flood on the way

If you start over

Tomorrow begins today



Amos:

"i’ll tell ya, edward --"

When we met i lived a kind of secretive life

I was a mysterious man

After meeting you i met myself and my wife

All because you told me i can

You’re upset

You’re in need

I've got land

And a deed

You can have every weed

Every stone

You’re the only man who i would ever give a thing to

The truest friend that i've ever knowwwwn!



"you’ll love this land. Lotsa tasty rabbits!"



Edward:

"thank you amos, thank you!"



Karl:

"edward! When i met you, i was living in a cave."



You convinced me to

Start over

Start over



"we’d offset the construction costs by floating a thirty-year

Fixed-rate bond tied to the to the nikkei index."



"...i know a guy."



In a rush

You’ll be flush

I’ll get cash

But hush-hush

I won’t do this for just any joe

You can start over

And edward i’ll give you the dough



Edward:

"thank you karl, thank you!"



I got you the land just over the hill

And money to build a new town



Zacky price:

Money to build a new town!?



Don price:

Money to build a new town!?



Townsfolk:

Money to build a new town!



All:

Start over

Start over

Instead of drown

We move the town

And start over

Men and women

We can sweat

We can fret

‘til we’re all soaking wet



Edward, don and zacky:

So you better believe what we say

If we start over tomorrow begins today



All:

Tomorrow begins today



Edward, don and zacky:

Tomorrow begins today



All:

Tomorrow begins

Tomorrow begins!
