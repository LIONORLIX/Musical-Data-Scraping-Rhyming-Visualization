Fight the Dragons


I've never been a man who lived an office life

I've never been a man behind a desk

I've always been a man who said that staying still was playing dead

The kind who's looking forward to the challenges ahead



People say that's irresponsible

People tell me stay at home

But I'm not made for things like mowing lawns or apron strings

I'm my best, when not at rest



So I fight the dragons and I storm the castles

And I win a battle or two

Then comes the day it's time,

I'm packing up and I am bringing all my stories home to you



All I can see is miles ahead with miles to go

All I can feel is wind and sun and sky

Stop for a coffee, make a friend, and pray the day will never end

'Cause there's one more adventure waiting 'round another bend



Where I fight the dragons and I storm the castles

And I win a battle or two

But then a feeling comes

Like fifty thousand drums all banging, "Bring my stories home to you"



And I wonder as I wander on the road from door to door

Exactly what you think of where I've been



Do you know I joined the circus, met a mermaid, fought a war?

Do you know I think of you through thick and thin?

Because even though I'm making deals and bringin' people joy

I'm usually only thinking of my boy



Out there on the road I pray

You'll come to my one day

And say, "Let's fight the dragons and then storm the castles 'til we win what needs to be won"

So when I'm old and tired, you'll do the job required

You'll be there telling stories to your son



And we fight the dragons and we storm the castles

And I do the best that I can

For everybody knows that's how the story goes

To turn each boy into a bigger man



So I'll fight the dragons 'til you can
