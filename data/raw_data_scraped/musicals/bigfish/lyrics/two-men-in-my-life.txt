Two Men in My Life


(Sandra Bloom)



There are two men in my life



Him and you



There are two men who’ll be speaking



When I’m through



There are few men like your dad



Not easy to define



I know he isn’t perfect



But he’s mine







There are two men in my life



Him and you



And I never want to choose between the two



He distorts and he invents



Some stories don’t make sense



But why should that confuse you



Why not let the man amuse you’







He tells a harmless tale



That always drives you mad



But aren’t you telling stories too



Your point of view



Just different from your dad







There are two men in my life



Him and you



And the stories I believe in



All come true



He can give you what you need



But you should take the lead







There is magic in the man



Please find it while you can
