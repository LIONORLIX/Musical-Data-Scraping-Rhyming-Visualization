Be the Hero


(Edward Bloom)



What if I told you



You could change the world



With just one thought



What if I told you



You could be a king



Anything you desire, boy



Anything on a plate



All within your power to create







I know somewhere in the darkness



There’s a story meant for me



Where I’ll always know exactly what to say



I know somewhere some surprising ending



Waits for me to tell it my own way







Be the hero of your story, if you can



Be the champion in the fight-



Not just the man



Don’t depend on other people



To put paper next to pen



Be the hero of your story, boy, and then



You can rise to be the hero once again







Now the best part of an adventure is the people you meet.







What if I said



I met a witch



When I was very young



What if I said



She showed me how I die







Powerless in the face of it



Terrified in the wood



That was where my life was



Changed for good







Hey!



What if I said



I met a giant,



Wasting in a cave



What if I claimed I rose



To be far braver



Than the brave



All my life of stories, son



And every one is true



So believe me



As I’m telling you







To be the hero of your story



While you may



Be the guy who gets the girl



And saves the day



You don’t need



A book of Greeks



To teach you how



To stay alive



Be the hero of each story



You derive



Then forever you’re



The story who’ll survive







Every tale that you invent



Can be a life



That you make real



Where each character



You meet



Becomes your friend



You don’t need to be



A novelist



To make believe what’s



Waiting ‘round the bend







(Edward & Company)



Be the hero of your story



'Til it's done



Why go promenade when you



Were born to run







(Edward Bloom)



If you understand



This premise



You will never be alone







(Edward & Partial Cast)



You can conquer



Every challenge



You can face each



Stepping stone







(Edward & All)



Be the hero of your story







(Edward Bloom)



What if I swore



I saw a mermaid swimming



In the mist



What if I told you



She would be the first girl



That I kissed



Out there in the water



Filled with eagerness and fear



Here is what she whispered



In my ear:







(Edward & Company)



Be the hero of your story



Be the hero of your story



Be the hero of your story







(Edward Bloom)



Now listen, son: Now one day I met this fisherman, see’







(Frustrated Fisherman)



Oh you gotta help me! If I don’t catch a fish, my family’s gonna starve!







(Edward Bloom)



The fish are sleepin’! You gotta get ‘em movin’. Try the Alabama Stomp!







Works every time!







Something about this rythym really gets their fins movin’. Give a man a fish, you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish, you feed him for a lifetime. Teach a man the Alabama Stomp, you feed his soul!







I know somewhere in the future



There’s adventure waits for me



Filled with mystery and people



I can love



I know out there



On the road of life



I’ll live the story I’ve been



Dreaming of







(Company)



Live the story I’ve been



Dreaming of!



Be the hero every time



You get the chance



If the music stops



Continue with the dance







(Edward Bloom)



On a wing or on a prayer



You get there



Only with your voice







(All)



Be attentive



Be inventive



Be the first one to rejoice



With the story in your heart



You won’t need



Any other choice



You’re a hero,



Fighting dragons, winning wars



Be the hero



And the world will soon be yours!
