Out There on the Road


(Edward Bloom)



You can pine your life away



Wishin’ things were better



Waitin’ here for judgment day



While knittin’ you a sweater



But I believe that kind of life



Won’t set your spirit free



So my friend,



One small suggestion



Where you oughtta be’







You can take a journey



Through this country’s



Flesh and blood



On a ride past countryside



And Mississippi mud



Hit the street with two big feet



To bear your heavy load



And live life out there on the road







Anyone you wanna be



And anything you say



Come tomorrow you’ll be free



Of who you are today



Action and adventure



When we change our fixed abode



Go live life out there on the road







Wouldn’t you rather be



Like royalty



Respected like a king



Where it’s all civilized



You’ll be surprised



The song you’ll hear ‘em sing



People’ll greet you there



Some wanna share



Enthusiastic news



And all you need is guaranteed



With one big pair of shoes



One big pair of shoes!







What’s your name, giant’







(Karl)



Karl.







(Edward Bloom)



Listen, Karl. The world is huge!







Don’t you wanna



Step outside



Look around



See what’s waiting there!







We were born to



Wake each morn



Some place we’ve never been



Checkin’ out the locals



As they watch us checkin’ in



Every new encounter



In another new zip code



We’ll find it out there-







(Townsfolk)



That’s him, right there!







(Edward Bloom)



Wait! He’s not a monster



He’s a thinker



He’s a whiz



This boy isn’t half as bad



As you all think he is



I’ve been so inspired



I’ve decided we’re a pair







(Edward & Karl)



We’re heading out there



On the road







(Jenny Hill)



You’re leaving’ Now’!







Edward Bloom



Don’t tell me that you’re



Leaving us for good







(Edward Bloom)



Jenny, yes I’m leaving



But ‘for good’ I never could



I’ll be back some day



(Jenny Hill)



And I’ll be waiting while



You’re gone







(Townsfolk)



'Til then,



Be happy on the road







(Edward Bloom)



C’mon Karl! Let’s show ‘em our traveling step! Every road trip needs a traveling step.







(Mayor)



Edward Bloom, take with you this Key to the City, and know our doors will always be open to you.







(Edward Bloom)



Suddenly, I’m the king



Who holds the key



But everybody secretly



Is dying to be



More and more



Like who’







(Karl)



Like you’







(All But Karl)



Like you!







I can see America



Dependable and true



Open sky and passerby



Congratulating you



Find the open highway



And you’ve hit



The mother lode







Go crazy







(Edward, Karl & Men)



Out there on the







(Edward, Karl & All)



Happy!



Out there on the



Finally out there







(Jenny Hill)



Promise you’ll return to us!







(Edward, Karl & All)



On the road!



On the road!!
