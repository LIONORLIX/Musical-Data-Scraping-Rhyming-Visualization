The Witch


(Witch)



Everyone dies, Edward Bloom. But your death is glorious. Let me show you.







(Edward Bloom)



Why would I want to see how I die’







(Witch)



What’s your concern’



Are you scared of



Hearing one thing new



When you could learn



Something secret that could



Help you through



In one good turn



I can show you



Counterfeit from true



Life begins



When you know how it ends







And yours is no ordinary life.







You become important



You’re the bravest man around



You’re the kind with virtue



Always finding common ground



You climb each hill



In front of you



Without a suffering sound



Compassionate and warm



The calm in any storm







(Other Witches)



So, take a chance







(Witch)



Let me show you



How your days unfold







(Other Witches)



And in advance







(Witch)



You and me can play



The hand you hold



When you gamble



Then you get the gold







(Other Witches)



Life begins when you know



How it ends







(Witch)



Don’t believe



The fairytales







That say life is a breeze



Every man must face a trial



That brings him to his knees



But let me share a magic truth



A proof of all that thrives







The ones who face their fears



Lead the most interesting lives







(Other Witches)



Interesting lives



Interesting lives!!







(Witch)



So tell me what you want







(Edward Bloom)



I want a big life







(Witch)



And tell me what you see







(Edward Bloom)



I see a road







(Witch)



And tell me where it goes







(Edward Bloom)



In one direction







(Witch)



So, don’t you want to see what’s next



What’s waiting in the void



You may be disappointed



But you may be overjoyed’







(Other Witches)



Ooh ooh ooh ooh’







(Witch)



So’







(All Witches)



Don’t be sad



Don’t be scared







Be alert



Be prepared



Take a breath



Take it slow



Let uncertainty go



When you know



How it ends you begin







(Other Witches)



When you try







(Witch)



You can fly







(Other Witches)



Fly!
