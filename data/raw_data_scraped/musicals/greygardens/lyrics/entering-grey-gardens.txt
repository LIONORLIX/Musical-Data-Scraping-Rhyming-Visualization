Entering Grey Gardens


(Male Chorus Lead)

When hedges hide the world away



(Edith - spoken)

Edie?



(Male Chorus Lead)

And shadows blur the time of day



(Edith - spoken)

Edie!



(Edie - spoken)

I'm feeding the cats!



(Male Chorus Lead)

When cans of cat food are pat?



(Chorus)

You're entering Grey Gardens



(Edith)

Liver pat??  You have to make it.  I can't make it.



(Edie)

When am I gonna get out of here?



(Female Chorus Member)

The musty smell of feline fur



(Male Chorus Member)

The dusty marks where pictures were



(Female Chorus)

The vermin in the furniture



(Chorus)

You're entering Grey Gardens



(Edith - spoken)

Edie!



(Male Chorus Member)

The ceiling sags, the stairway creaks

The faucet drips, the toilet leaks

The crumbling walls, the broken clocks



(Chorus)

It's like a twenty-eight room litterbox



(Male Chorus Member)

One-hundred-fifty windowsills

To catch a wink or two



(Chorus)

And that's Grey Gardens from a cats eye view



(Edith - spoken)

I'll die if I don't eat!



(Male Chorus Member - spoken)

Meow



(Edie - spoken)

I found your pat?, Mother darling



(Male Chorus Member - spoken)

Meow



(Edie - spoken)

I think it's pat?, the label, it's faded

Is it pat?, or is it giblets for the cats?



(Male Chorus Member - spoken)

Meow



(Male Chorus Member - spoken)

Meow



(Chorus Members - spoken)

Meow



(Chorus)

The fog rolls in, and there it stays

It suffocates the house in haze

From room to room, it drifts about

And nobody except a cat gets out



(Male Chorus Member)

A haven from a callous world

With no one saying "shoo"



(Chorus)

And that's Grey Gardens from a cat's eye view



(Edie - spoken)

I may die with this diet.  I don't like it at all



(Male Chorus Member - spoken)

Meow



(Edith - spoken)

Ever since you started trying to lose weight, you've been impossible



(Chorus Members - spoken)

Meow



(Edie - spoken)

I'm not gaining it back



(Male Chorus Member - spoken)

Meow



(Edith - spoken)

Starve yourself, not me!



(Male Chorus Members - spoken)

Meow



(Edie - spoken)

Here's your pat?, Mother Darling



(Chorus Members - spoken)

Meow
