Miss Buveau:

Now see edith i need to get my voice like in the fortys



Edith:

For petes sake you cant do that you cant even remeber you name



Kids:

The girl who got everything was the best here breast were large HA!!!!!!!!!!!



Brooks, Sr. (spoken):

Sorry to interrupt your rehearsal ma`am, but about Mister Beale,

surely he`s coming home for the party`



Big Edie (spoken):

Well I should say so! He`s announcing his daughter`s engagement.

Wall Street will have to do without him for a day!



(sung):

Mister Beale thinks making money matters more,

Than a restful family summer by the shore.

But unless some act of God divine,

Derails the New York-Montauk line,

He`s arriving on the five-fifteen.



Brooks, Sr. (spoken):

Then I`ll have a car waiting at the station.



Jackie and Lee (spoken):

Auntie Edith, Auntie Edith!



Big Edie (spoken):

Girls, Girls! Look at you Jackie, lovely! And Lee, a fright! What have you been doing`



Lee (spoken):

Sing for us Aunt Edith!



Big Edie (spoken):

Now girls, make yourselves useful.

Go out to the garden and make some pretty little nosegays to wear at the party.



Jackie and Lee (spoken):

Please! Please! Just one song!



Big Edie (spoken):

Ha ha ha ha! Alright Gould, what`s next on the bill, Indian Love Poem`



Gould (spoken):

No, the mysterious Orient.



Big Edie (spoken):

Hit it!



(sung):

Pretty itty-bitty Geisha!

Delicate and small and sweet!

Kneeling on katami

Making origami,

Hobbling on her poor, bound feet!



All:

Uhh! (grunt)



Big Edie (sung):

Pity itty-bitty Geisha!

(Jackie and Lee (sung at the same time): Ee-oww! Chimmy, chimmy chow chim!)

Hiding all her foolish pride!

(Jackie and Lee (sung at the same time): Coochie, coochie, coo!)

Let your auntie Edith,

Finish her rehearsal,

Take your silly selves outside!



(spoken):

Scoot! Ha ha ha ha ha!

Utter terrors those two!



Gould (spoken):

I just adore children! Especially grown ones.



Brooks, Sr. (spoken):

Ma`am, the caterers arrived, where would you like them to set up`



Big Edie (sung):

Put the chafing dishes on the garden ledge,

Once the gardener has finished with the hedge.

Chill the vichyssoise and heat the veal,

And wish me luck, `cause Mister Beale,

Is arriving on the five-fifteen.



Big Edie (spoken):

What time is it`



Gould (spoken):

Half past eleven.



Big Edie (spoken):

Good Lord!



(sung):

One o`clock!

Set the chairs and the table!

Two o`clock!

Raise the big, white tent!

Three o`clock!

Reginaldo does our hair!



Gould (spoken):

Now that sounds promising!



Big Edie (sung):

Four o`clock!

Hang the Japanese lanterns!

Five o`clock!

Mix the champagne punch!



Jackie and Lee (sung):

Take the inchworms of the peonies!



Gould (sung):

Pink umbrellas for the daiquiris!



Big Edie (sung):

The Ambassador and Rose will tour the grounds.



(spoken):

Like a spread from house and garden!



(sung):

She expounds!



Gould (spoken):

Oh, how nouveau riche!



Big Edie (sung):

Have the piano tuned and moved outdoors,

By cocktail hour, mine, not yours!

And restrict yourself to grenadine!



Jackie and Lee (spoken):

Nyah, Nyah!



Big Edie (sung):

You cannot be sloshed



All (sung):

At five-fifteen!



(phone rings)



Brooks, Sr. (spoken):

Beale residence. Hold please! Lady from the Hamptons Bee.



Big Edie (spoken):

(Gasp) Why hello Margaret! Yes darling, half past five! Ha-hem.

Well everyone is simply at two o`clock going to come from Hyannis.

Well, the press table is going to be awfully crowded,

but if you don`t mind sharing a folding chair with Harper`s Bazaar!

Sing` Me` Heavens no! It`s Edie`s day,

not mine! Although people can be so insistent and I hate to disappoint!

Twist my arm, blackmail me, threaten my very life and who knows,

you might get a verse   of something! Yes darling, half-past. Where were we`



All (sung):

One o`clock!



Big Edie (sung):

Stake the droopy hydranges!



All (sung):

Two o`clock!



Big Edie (sung):

Fill the Lotus pond!



All (sung):

Three o`clock!



Big Edie (sung):

Lock the cat up in its room!



Jackie and Lee (sung):

Aw! Poor kitty!



All (sung):

Four o`clock!



Big Edie (spoken):

Glaze the salmon in aspic!



All (sung):

Five o`clock!



Big Edie (sung):

Crack the crab on ice!

With the privet pruned and manicured,

And my daughter`s future well-assured!

Grey Gardens will be decked up in its pride!

Little Edie will be here with Joe in time!

Like a Norman Rockwell family,

Our photo in the Hamptons Bee!



Gould (sung):

The event of 1941!



Jackie and Lee (sung):

Of East, West, South, and Bridgehampton!



Big Edie (sung):

Though perhaps I`ve overspent a bit,

The man who`s gonna pay for it



All (sung):

Is arriving on the five-fifteen!

Who-oo!
