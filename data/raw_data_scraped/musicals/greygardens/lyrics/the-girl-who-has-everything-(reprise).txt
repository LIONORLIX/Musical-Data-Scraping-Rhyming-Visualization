The Girl Who Has Everything (reprise)


[Record Playing]

She is the girl who has everything.

She has the world on a string.

Dancing where ever her fancy may be

Light as a breeze

watching the willow tree



[Edie]

Witch soup would you like mother darling

the soup or the bis

would you like the bis



[Edith]

You chose.
