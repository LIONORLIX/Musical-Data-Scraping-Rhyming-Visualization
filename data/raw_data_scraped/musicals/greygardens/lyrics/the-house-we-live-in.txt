The House We Live In


LA-DA-DA-DA-DA-DA-DUM

TA-DA-DA-DA-DA-DA-DUM

(You think my costume is down’ I feel something slipping. I feel something)

It’s a big house, the house we live in (big hit, this)

It’s a big job guarding Freedom’s doors (World War Two)

It’s a big foe across the ocean (that means Hitler)

But a big gal lights our golden shores! (‘and wheee!)

With a big heart here on the homefront (just exhausting!)

Every little guy pitch in! (here comes the good part!)

March! March! March to buy your war bonds

So the house we live in will win!

LA-DA-DA-DA-DA-DA-DUM

TA-DA-DA-DA-DA-DA-DUM

TEN-HUT! COMPANY ‘ FALL IN!

It’s a big house, the house we live in (My God!)

It’s a big job guarding Freedom’s doors	(Windows and Doors!)

It’s a big foe across the ocean (Anchors aweigh!)

But a big gal lights our golden shores! (Big as Staten Island!)

Teal the big day we steal the beach front (that means D-Day)

And we liberate Berlin (you weren’t even born yet)

March! March! March to buy your war bonds

So the house we live in will win!

Be alert (tip and glide!)

Stand your ground (stand aside!)

Check the sky if a siren should sound (my pulse is pounding!)

Pull your weigh (work those thighs!)

Do your share (Slenderize!)

Keep recruits on their chutes in the air (my god, where did all my hair go’)

Over land, over sea. Fight to keep the free world free (I need an agent!)

‘as we March! March! Marching for each other

Every man-jack, Junior, Miss and mother

Coz we all are one another’s brother

One big family under the skin!

And the house we live in will win!
