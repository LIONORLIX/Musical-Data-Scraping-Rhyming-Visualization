Peas in a Pod


[Edie](spoken)

Oh my goodness. Is this on the bill? It's one of my favorites.



[Edith](spoken)

Edie. Please.



[Edie](spoken)

It's the very first song you ever taught me. We used to sing it together.



(sung)

Given our amazing similarities

We could be a plate of eggs and ham.

A pair of canaries,

I shadow you like Mary's lamb



[Edith](spoken)

I'm sorry, I'm in no mood-



[Edie](spoken)

For me, Mother, please? I'll sing the man's part.



(sung)

Physically, a few discreet disparities

Ought to keep us happy as...

Happy as...



[Edith]

...As a clam



[Edie]

Why fight it, lady?

Our star is in ascendance!

Make me your matey-



[Edith & Edie]

And I'll give you my independence



[Gould](spoken)

Well, come on, Edith, don't tell me you forgot the staging.



[Edith](spoken)

I didn't forget it, I just don't want to do it.



[Gould](spoken)

Just do it and for God's sake, smile.



[Edie]

We're a bowl of peaches and cream.



[Edith]

The Dodgers and Brooklyn



[Edie]

A permanent team.



[Edith]

India and Gandhi



[Edie]

Dagwood and his Blondie.



[Edith & Edie]

Two peas in a pod



[Edie]

We're an act like Crosby and Hope.



[Edith]

A rosy complexion and Ivory Soap.



[Edie]

Pip and Miss Estella



[Edith]

Hedda and Louella



[Edith & Edie]

Two peas in a pod.

We stick together

Like a cushion and pins.



[Edie]

Birds of a feather



[Edith]

I'd say "Siamese twins."



[Edith & Edie]

Ever-aftering where

We will build a cozy retreat

Which no nosy neighbors

Can see from the street.



[Edie]

What need we Manhattan?



[Edith]

Just us and a cat in-



[Edith & Edie]

A cottage on Cape Cod

For two, please - two peas in a pod.



[Gould](spoken)

Oh come on, Edith. Dance! A soft shoe! How can you resist?



[Edith](spoken)

I can't help myself! It's the music and I'm its hapless victim!



[Gould](spoken)

Aren't we all, kid, aren't we all?



[Edith & Edie]

If by our devotion

Nature gets the notion

To send a gift from God,

Send two please.



[Edie]

Say kootchie-koo.



[Edith & Edie]

Cuties-



[Edith]

-In pink and blue.



[Edith & Edie]

Two, please - two peas in a pod.

Two peas in a pod.

Two peas in a pod.
