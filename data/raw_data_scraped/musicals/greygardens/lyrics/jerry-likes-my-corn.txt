Jerry Likes My Corn


EDITH

Jerry likes the way I do my corn

Isn`t he a treasure?

More corn!

Look at how he chows right through my corn

It`s my only pleasure



I boil it on the hot plate

Till all the juice is gone

Bless his soul

He knows which side my corn is buttered on



Jerry lacks a mother`s tender care

Nobody to need him

Mother`s now are barely ever there

Someone`s gotta feed him



The kind of things that I like

His high school friends all scorn:

Cottage cheese, chamomile,

Dr. Norman Vincent Peale

But, Jerry likes my corn



(Spoken)  The things you do for me, Jerry.  You`re my Gibraltar.



JERRY

The corn is out of this world!



EDITH

Oh, did I do it nicely?  He always compliments me on the way I do my corn!



Jerry is a son like my own two



LITTLE EDIE

Sons who never phone you



EDITH

More salt`



Boys have more important things to do



LITTLE EDIE

After they disown you



EDITH

And though he hardly says much

I understand his grunts

`Hey` means `hi`

`Yo` means `yes`

Believe me, he`s no dunce!



Anything that breaks he knows which tool

Jerry is a fixer



(pointing to LITTLE EDIE) Not her



Happy hour starts right after school

Jerry, have a mixer



He tells me things the kids like

And I just feel reborn:

Mountain Dew, Super Bowl,

Sex and drugs and rock n` roll

But, most of all, my corn



(Spoken) Jerry, you know what I`d like?  Some music.  I`m happier when I`m singing than anything I`ve ever done since I was

born.  See if you can find that song.  Oh, you know the one I just adore.



LITTLE EDIE

Let me help, Mother Darling, I`m extremely organized.  I know exactly where to look for that record`



EDITH

No!  Let Jerry.



LITTLE EDIE

I`ve got it under control, kid, I can find it.



EDITH

Jerry can find things in his house--right on this bed--you couldn`t find for half an hour.



LITTLE EDIE

I`m so sick of that kid!  I mean, I have great pity for him and I like him.



EDITH

The trouble is she`s madly in love with him.  Oh, pardon me, but it`s true.



LITTLE EDIE

Well, he might as well leave right now cause he`s never gonna get it so that`s it!



EDITH

Get what`  Sex with you`



LITTLE EDIE

That`s all they`re after!  That`s all they`re after!



EDITH

An old person like you`  Good god!



LITTLE EDIE

Tomcats!  All of `em!  So you might as well tell him right now to forget about it.



EDITH

Jerry doesn`t want any sex with you

Jerry likes his own age



LITTLE EDIE

Oh yes!



EDITH

Kids at seventeen do not pursue

Relics of the stone age



LITTLE EDIE

Believe me, I can tell these things!



EDITH

Jerry doesn`t want any sex with you

Jerry isn`t crazy

Adolescent girls now are easy lays

Same as Edie in her awkward phase



Jerry has a new girl every night

And not a one of them have cellulite`



LITTLE EDIE

He`s gonna be here for years and years and years`



EDITH

He doesn`t want any sex with you!  Get out of here!



LITTE EDIE

I want the people I want in this house!



EDITH

Go away!  You`re making me very angry!



Jerry doesn`t fight like two fish wives

Jerry likes relaxing

(Me too)

Now and then we play my forty-fives

Hear the old sad sax sing



No picnic growing older

Abandon and forlorn

Stuck in bed, stiff with gout

Alcoholic drinks are out--

You`ll die!

The doctor`s warn

Then quick as a wink

I`m in the pink

`Cause Jerry likes my corn



(Spoken) I tell ya, that boy is a gift.
