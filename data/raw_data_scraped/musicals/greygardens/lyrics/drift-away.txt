Drift Away


[Gould]

Understand kid,

It's been just grand, kid.

The cocktails, the cufflinks - the fun.

Remember me when you're singing "Tea for One."



[Edith](spoken)

If you're gone, who would I even talk to?



[Gould](spoken)

Yourself. The occasional cat.



[Edith](spoken)

That's not funny.



[Gould]

After I'm gone,

When the ocean's haze

Blankets the grounds in grey

Drift away, on the tide,

Drift away.

When you're alone,

And the twilight's glow

Shimmers across the bay

Drift away, on a wave,

Drift away.

Our tete-a-tetes-



[Edith]

Midnight duets-



[Gould & Edith]

Our breakfast tea and toast.



[Gould]

Funny how things that mean the least

Are what we miss the most.

Deep in the night

When the whispering breeze

Sings this song I play,

Shed a tear and be glad

For the fun that we had.

Drift away, on a dream...

Drift away.



[Edith](spoken)

You're my soul mate, that's what you are.



[Gould](spoken)

"Soul mate." Is that the nom de jour?



[Edith](spoken)

I've no idea what you mean.



[Gould](spoken)

For the party this afternoon, which would you prefer?

Should I wear the white satin jacket you bought for me at Bergdorf's?

Or the linen one you picked up in Rome?



[Edith](spoken)

Now, Gould-! Gould!
