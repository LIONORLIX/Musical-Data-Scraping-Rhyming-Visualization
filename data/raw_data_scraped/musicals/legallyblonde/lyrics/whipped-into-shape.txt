Whipped Into Shape


BROOKE

(spoken) Hi, I'm Brooke Windham and welcome back

to the Windham Workout Disk Two Challenge and our daily commitment to being

the best that we can be!



VIDEO PEOPLE

(spoken) Yeah!



So grab your CardioWhyp 5000(TM)...

'Cause if you want to get ripped, you've gotta get... Whypped!



(sung) Do you want an easy miracle?

Do you want to lose a pound or two?

Then you can turn this off right now

My workout's not for you.



I'm talkin' to the woman who wants it all:

Gotta pay for what you get

These size 2 clothes don't come to those

Too lazy to sweat!



I want you whipped into shape

When I say jump, say "How high?"

You'll know you're doing it right

When you start to cry



If you don't look like you should,

You've got to whip it, whip it, whip it good

I'm sorry, ladies, no escape

Til you're whipped into shape!



(spoken) Come on, Sabrina, you heifer! Work it out!



SABRINA

(spoken) I hate you, Brooke!  And I love you for it!



Whipped into sh--



ENID

(spoken) Hey, why'd you pause it?



CALLAHAN

(spoken) We have a lot to cover.



(sung) Meet our brand new client, Brooke

You can laugh, but she's made tons

Off her DVDs and book

"Whip Your Way to Tighter Buns"



Happily married, so she swears

To her sixty-year-old stud

Til stepdaughter came downstairs

And found Brooke all covered in his blood



If Brooke took a plea

I'd have her out in 3 to 4

But she claims she did not kill him



WARNER

(spoken) Did she?



CALLAHAN

(spoken) Let's watch some more...



BROOKE

But it's more than just a workout

It's a defensive weapon too

Simply wrap it round your assailant's neck

And pull til he turns blue!



You can also use the patented handle grip

To shatter your attacker's spine

And all for three small payments of

$19.99!



You'll have him whipped into shape

When you get grief from a guy

Just work him over with this

Til he starts to cry



If he don't act like he should

You've got to whip it, whip it, whip it good

It gets you out of any scrape

It gets you whipped into shape



(spoken) Come on, people!



(sung) Whipped into shape!



(spoken) What does not kill us makes us hotter!



CALLAHAN

(spoken) Hands?  Who thinks she's guilty?



(sung) Okay, now here is where you kids come in:

Brooke has trouble trusting me

I'm her only chance to win

But I don't speak MTV



Though Brooke won't help her own defense

She may listen to her peers

Go and place a little sense

In the space between her ears



ELLE

(spoken) I'm a Delta N--



CALLAHAN

(spoken) Not now.



(sung)I want her whipped into shape

If there's a brain in that hair

Tell it that I am the key

It's a plea or the chair



See when I talk to her I

Get neither plea nor plan nor alibi

To quote from our defendant's tape:

I want her "whipped into shape!"



(spoken) To the jail!



BROOKE

(spoken) Ladies,

just because we're at Boston Women's Correctional Facility does not mean

we can't become the best that we can be!  HERE WE GO!



Circle!  Circle!  Under!  Over!  Through!  Around!  Again!  Good!



Circle!  Circle!  Under!  Over!  Through!

Around!  All right, ladies, we can't break out of here, but we sure can break a sweat!



Left!  Right!  Left!  Right!  Good!

Left!  Right!  Left!  Right!  Left!  Right!



Work it out!



(sung) I want you whipped into shape

When I say jump, say "How high?"

You know you're doing it right

When you start to cry



If you don't look like you should

You've got to whip it, whip it, whip it good

Like prison, ladies, no escape

Til you're whipped into shape!



Whip it!  Whip it!



Whipped into shape



Whip it!  Whip it!



Swipe it!  Swipe it!  Swipe it through!  Check it out!  Double jump!



Swipe it!  Swipe it!  Swipe it through!  Check it out!  Double jump!



That's right!  You've got it!



Whip it!

Whip it!

Whip it!

Get whipped into shape!!
