What You Want


ELLE

(Spoken) Wait a sec!  This is the kind of girl Warner wants!

Someone serious!

Someone lawyerly!

Someone who wears black when nobody's dead!

Girls, I have a completely brilliant plan!



(sung)What you want, Warner

What you want is me

But you need to see me in a brand new domain



Well it's plain, Warner

In a different setting, you will see you're getting

All of this plus a brain!



I'll meet you there at Harvard with a book in my hand

Big sturdy book, big wordy book

Full of words I'll understand

And right there is where you'll see it too

Warner, what you want is right in front of you!



GIRLS

What you want



ELLE

It's clear



GIRLS

What you want



ELLE

Right here



GIRLS

What you want is right in front of you, front of you

What you want



ELLE

It's clear



GIRLS

What you want



ELLE

Right here



GIRLS

What you want is right in front of you, front of you



ELLE

Step one, he's off to Harvard law

So I get in there too



GIRLS

Step two!



ELLE

Make Warner reassess

Impress him with my high IQ



GIRLS

Step three!



ELLE

We throw a great big wedding



ELLE and GIRLS

And invite all Delta Nu!



ADVISOR

(Spoken) That's great, nice plan.  Now can we think this through?

Harvard Law School?



ELLE

(Spoken) I have a 4.0 average.



ADVISOR

(Spoken) Yeah, in Fashion Merchandising.

What makes you think you can do this?



ELLE

Love!  I'm doing this for love!

And love will see me through

Yes with love on my side, I can't lose

And Harvard can't refuse

A love so pure and true

Don't lawyers feel love too?



ADVISOR

(spoken)Even if they do . . .



(sung)What you want, sweetheart is no easy thing

If you're going to swing it, it will wreck your senior spring, yeah it's true

First, you'll need an LSAT score of more than 174

So no more parties for you



You'll need a killer essay, or do not even hope

And glowing letters from your betters

Any chance you know the pope?



ELLE

Hm nope!



KATE

Too bad cause that would be a coup

And you've got a lot of work in front of you



GIRLS

What you want



ELLE

Yes I know



GIRLS

What you want



ELLE

Even so



GIRLS

What you want is right in front of you, front of you



GIRLS

What you want

(Girl, you go!)

What you want



ADVISOR

(spoken) No, really, go!



GIRLS

What you want is right in front of you, front of you



FATHER

(spoken) Law school?



ELLE

(spoken) Yes, Daddy, law school!



FATHER

(spoken) Good God, why?  Law school is for boring, ugly, serious people!

And you, Button, are none of those things.



(sung) What you want, Button, you just say the word!

But what you want's absurd and costs a whole lot of swag

And hell why?

Button, when you can stay right here

Pursue a film career



MOTHER

How 'bout a nice burken bag?



FATHER

Yes, the east coast is foreign

There's no film studios

It's cold and dark, no valet parking

All the girls have different noses!

Christ, BUtton! It's like the damned frontier



PARENTS

Tell me what's out there that you can't get right here?



ELLE

Guys, love!



PARENTS

Love?



ELLE

I'm going there for love



PARENTS

Good God!



ELLE

A love I have to win

I can live without sun or valet

I can't just walk away

Betray what might have been



FATHER

Fine, okay, I'll pay your way if you get in!



ALL

What you want



PARENTS

Make good grades



ALL

What you want



PARENTS

And it's paid



ALL

What you want is right in front of you, front of you



SORORITY GIRL

(spoken) Hey everybody, it's the spring fling beer bash extreme!



FRAT GUYS

ADVISOR

(spoken) Not for you!  Time to study!  Go!



SORORITY GIRL

(spoken) This year's theme:  Jamaican me crazy!!!



GRANDMASTER CHAD

What you want, you wanna be out because the sun is warm

What you want, you wanna be study-stuck inside your dorm

What you want, you wanna be partyin' with us all night long

What you want, you wanna be strong



ADVISOR

(spoken) Be strong!



ALL

Oh-oh



ADVISOR

(spoken) 134.  Not good enough.  Try again.  Go!



GRANDMASTER CHAD

What you want, you wanna be groovin' up and shake the room

What you want, you wanna be provin' something and to whom

What you want, you wanna be wonderin' where you your youth has gone

What you want, you wanna hold on



ELLE:

Hold on!



ALL

Oh-oh



ADVISOR

(spoken) 151.  Still not Harvard material.  Once again.  Go!



GRANDMASTER CHAD

What you want, you wanna be breathing in the healthy air

What you want, you wanna be chasing him and he don't care

What you want, you wanna ignore the pity in your looks

What you want, you wanna say sorry, go and hit me books

What you want, you wanna sittin' like a lonely child

What you want, you wanna be drivin' all the fellas wild

What you want, you wanna be feelin' good to be alive...



ELLE

Love!  I'm doing this for love,

And that's how I'll survive.

Here you go, I said no, go away!

Right here is where I'll stay

Until that happy day

That day I hear them say . . .



ADVISOR

175



ANGELIC VOICES

175



ELLE

175!



ANGELIC VOICES

175, 175!!!





HARVARD PROFESSOR

(spoken) So, gentlemen,

Harvard Law grants admission to Adam Cohen and Sundeep Padamadan.

And now, Ms. Elle Woods...

Who was kind enough to send in a headshot.



OTHER PROFESSOR

(spoken) We should admit her, for reasons of, um . . . multiculturalism!



PROFESSORS

(spoken) Multiculturalism!



HARVARD PROFESSOR

(spoken) Oh gentlemen, please!  Get a hold of yourselves!

Oh, look at that!  Oh, what a shame!

She didn't bother sending in a personal essay!



SORORITY GIRL

(spoken) How's this for a personal essay?



GIRLS

What you want!



HARVARD PROFESSOR

Goodness me!



GIRLS

What you want!



HARVARD PROFESSOR

Security!



GIRLS

What you want is right in--



HARVARD PROFESSOR

(spoken) Who are you?



ELLE

I'm what you want, Harvard

I'm the girl for you!



ELLE and GIRLS

And to prove it's true



ELLE

We all flew here on Jet Blue



ELLE and GIRLS

Thank you!



JET BLUE PILOT

Thank you!



GIRLS

This is what Elle Woods inspires

Everyone admires her

And Harvard should too!



HARVARD PROFESSOR

(spoken) This is NOT a personal essay!



GIRLS

No! An essay's so boring and so much does not fit

So we're appearing live, right here

Making clear you must admit

That Elle Woods should join the chosen few

Harvard, what you want is right in front of--



ELLE

May I approach!



GIRLS

Uh-huh!  Oh yeah!  Go Elle!



HARVARD PROFESSOR

(spoken) Now see here, Ms. Woods!

You can't just barge in here with singing and dancing and ethnic movement.

This is a very flashy presentation, but I still don't see one reason to admit you!



ELLE

How about love?

Have you ever been in love?

Cause if you have, you'll know

That love never accepts a defeat

No challenge it can't meet

No place it cannot go

Don't say no to a woman in love



Don't laugh when I say love

Don't think that I'm naive

Because even a person who's smart

Can listen to their heart

Can listen and believe

So believe in what love can achieve



Do you believe?



PROFESSOR

(spoken) I do!



ELLE

Do you believe?



PROFESSOR

(spoken) Me too!



ALL

Yes, we believe in love!

How 'bout you?



HARVARD PROFESSOR

(spoken) Welcome to Harvard!



ALL

(cheers)

What you want

What you want

What you want is right in front of you, front of you

What you want

What you want

What you want is right in front of you, front of you



What you want

What you want

What you want

What you want!
