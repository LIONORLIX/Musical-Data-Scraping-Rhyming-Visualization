Find My Way


ELLE

Though I dreamed of this day long ago

Now my answer is thank you, but no

Look, I've barely begun, I'm hardly through



I was living in ignorant bliss

Til I learned I could be more than this

And you know, in a way I owe it all to you



I thought losing your love was a blow I could never withstand

Look how far I have come without anyone holding my hand



I had to find my way

The day you broke my heart

You handed me the chance

To make a brand new start



You helped me find my way

There's still so much to learn

So many dreams to earn

But even if I crash and burn ten times a day



I think I'm here to stay

I'm gonna find my way



VIVIENNE

(spoken) William Shakespeare wrote

"To thine own self be true, and it must follow as the night the day,

thought cans't not then be false to any man."



I think this wise statement best applies to a woman--a blonde woman.

Over the past three years, she taught me and showed us

all that being true to yourself never goes out of style.



Ladies and gentlemen, our valedictorian:



ELLE WOODS!!!!!!!



ELLE

(spoken) Ladies and gentlemen of the class of...



PAULETTE

Here's the part where she gives her big speech

We're so proud, but Elle's not one to preach

So she said we can play "Where are they now?"

Here we go!!!



Enid practices family law

Vivienne's training for the peace corps

Warner quit, said he makes more modeling anyhow

Callahan ran for governor, but was defeated of course

And his wife hired Emmett to handle their messy divorce



And me, I think I'll find my way

And hey!  I married Kyle!

And now we have two kids

And one more on the way

And we live out in Worcester

I bought a new salon

We also feature dog grooming

Here!  Take a couple cards!



Oops, sorry!  Back to Elle . . .



ELLE

I thank you one and all

The ones who thought I'd fall

Who taught me how to fail

Who helped me to prevail

I'm standing here today

To help me find my way!



Oh, and if you could give one second before we all go

Emmett Forrest, please make the happiest woman I know
