Ireland (Reprise)


PAULETTE

(spoken) Elle, if a girl like you can't win back her man,

then there is no hope for the rest of us!  You go and you fight for him!



(sung) The Irish fear nothing and no one

They keep fightin' 'til everyone's dead

I'm not sure where this metaphor's goin'

I just felt like it had to be said



There's a guy at that party who loves you

Something most of us only dream of

You go out there and you get some Ireland

The country of whiskey and love
