Serious


WARNER:

We both know why we're here

I see it in your eyes

I guess it calms my fear

To know it's not a surprise

I thought one look at you

Looking like a dream come true

Would leave me speechless like you always do



But now we're wide awake

We've got some plans to make

Let's take some action, baby



So, baby, give me your hand

I've got some dreams to make true

I've got the future all planned

It's time to get serious

Time to get serious with you



ELLE:

I never thought that I-



WARNER:

(spoken) Uh, honey, I'm not finished.



ELLE:

(spoken) Oh, sorry!



WARNER:

Since I was two or three



ELLE:

Mmmm



WARNER:

My life was planned out neat



ELLE:

Mmmm



WARNER:

I'd get my law degree



ELLE:

Yeahh



WARNER:

And then win my senate seat



ELLE:

Mmmm



WARNER:

A big white house back east



ELLE:

Oh, ohh



WARNER:

All of the amenities



ELLE:

Yeahh



WARNER:

Three kids



BOTH:

At least, just like the Kennedys



WARNER:

Here's where our lives begin



ELLE:

Our lives begin



WARNER:

Just where do you fit in?



ELLE:

Fit me in!



WARNER:

I'll break it down now, baby

So, baby, give me your hand



ELLE:

Oo, whoaa, here's my hand, here's my hand



WARNER:

I've got some dreams to make true



ELLE:

We both have dreams to make true



WARNER:

I'll know that you'll understand



ELLE:

Oh yes, I understand



BOTH:

It's time to get serious

Time to get serious



WARNER:

With you

Serious



ELLE:

Serious



WARNER:

Gotta wake up and take our journey

Serious



ELLE:

Serious



WARNER:

I'm telling you as a future attorney



ELLE:

Oh, oh



WARNER:

You want the moon and sky

Then take it, don't be shy



ELLE:

Heyy



WARNER:

Baby, that's why you and I



ELLE:

I, you and I



WARNER:

Should break up!



ELLE:

Hey, baby, I'll give you my hand, we-

(Spoken) WHAT??  You're breaking up with me?

I thought you were proposing!



WARNER:

(Spoken) Elle, if I'm gonna be a senator when I'm thirty,

I'm gonna need somebody



Serious

Less of a Marilyn, more of a Jackie

Serious

Somebody classy and not too tacky



ELLE:

(Spoken) What?!



WARNER:

Okay, that came out wrong



ELLE:

(Sobs)



WARNER:

Baby, let's both be strong



ELLE:

(Sobs)



WARNER:

I mean, we've known all along



ELLE:

(Spoken) Just shut up!  What does that mean, I'm not a Jackie?

I'm not serious?  But I am seriously in love with you.



WARNER:

Baby, my future's all planned

I've got some dreams to make true

I thought that you'd understand

It's time to get serious

Time to get serious



(Spoken) Check, please.
