So Much Better


Elle:

All of this time I've planed,

I'd be patient, and,

You would love me again.



You'd come to respect my mind,

and at last you'd find,

You could love me again.



And I have turned my whole world

upside down,

trying not to let you go...

Watching you walk away

is like a fatal blow.



WHOA!



Is that my name up on that list?

Does someone know that I exist?

Is this a mistake?

Am I even Awake?

Pinch me now to make sure...



OW!



Yes that's my name in black and white

maybe I'm doing something right

WOW! I feel so much better

Than before!



WARNER!



Sorry I've been a pest

But I guess my best

Was not working with you

But looks like I've found a cure

And I so look forward to working with you



Hey remember when we spent spring break

In the hot tub every night

We said nothing else

Could ever feel so right

Well this might!



Seeing my name up on that list

That beats the first time that we kissed

You thought I was dumb

But I think that somebody's judgement was poor

Seeing my name in black and white

It's like making love with you all night

NO WAIT!

It feels so much better

hello much better

its oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

much better

'cause I am so much better than before



Maybe she's what you prefer

But hey last year I was her

Maybe you will change your mind

But you might look up to find

I've gone on to better things

Better jobs or bigger rings

I don't have the time to cry

I'm too busy loving my name up on that list

kind of a cool ironic twist

who else can I tell?

Oh Wait where's my cell?

Mom will fall on the floor



HEY MOM!



Look at my name in black and white

your daughter's doing something right

I feel so much better



I'll be there on monday nine o'clock

and we will see who walks the walk

NO NO I CAN'T WAIT!

I will be there at eight

When they unlock the door



OH OH

I'll even dress in black at white

See I have not begun to fight

And you'll go OH much better and

OH much better

and soon all y'all know much better



I am so much better

I am so much better

I am so much better

than before!
