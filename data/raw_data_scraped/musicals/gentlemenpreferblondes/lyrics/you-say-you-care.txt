You Say You Care


DOROTHY

A house on Rittenhouse Square

Wouldn't be so hard to take,

But the things I would do

Would embarrass you,

And even the Quakers would quake.

I'd probably get you in Dutch

With the Pennsylvania Dutch,

So I don't think I should marry you,

I care for you too much.



HENRY

You say you care,

And all at once

A million roses pour their perfume on the air.

You say you care,

And you put words

To what the whipporwills are singing ev'rywhere.

How sweet, how strange

That all my loneliness

Should change into the loveliness we share.

If you were there,

No cloud would be too high,

And darling, I would even swim the sea

Just to hear you say you care for me.
