Mamie Is Mimi


She was a gal, they called her chippy,

She was a gal that they knew too well.

She was a Miss in Mississippi,

And now she's a Mademoiselle.



Her name was Mame,

To France she came,

Now Mamie is Mimi,

The toast of the Rue de La Paix.

Her clothes are chic,

Her men are weak,

Now Mamie is Mimi,

A baby they call a bebe.

With a terrific sense of humor

And a tight dress,

She was a hit the day she hit Paree.

But there's a most persistent rumor

She'll never say yes,

Never say yes,

Only will say "Oui! Oui! Oui!"

Blase, bizarre,

She's now a star,

A filly, a dilly

Who used to pitch woo,

The former Mamie is Mimi,

The toast of the Rue

De La Paix.
