Keeping Cool With Coolidge


DOROTHY

Get set! Get hot!

Get the lead out of your you-know-what!

Let's show our President

We're glad he's the White House resident.



Step on the gas

And dance to a rhythm that's class-A,

Hey, hey,

This is the way

We're keepin' cool with Coolidge.

Be up to date

And pass up a rhythm that's passe,

Hey, hey,

Wiggle and sway,

We're keepin' cool with Coolidge.

Young folks, old folks, shake a leg,

Ev'rything is hotsy-totsy.

Even if they break a leg,

Who cares?

Mama loves jazz,

Papa loves jazz,

Razz-a-ma, razz-a-ma, razz-a-ma-tazz!

What a relief

You get when the rhythm has gotcha,

Hotcha,

Hail to the chief,

We're keepin' cool with Coolidge,

He's our pal,

We're keepin' cool with Cal.



ALL

Young folks, old folks, shake a leg,

It's the cat's meow,

Oh, wow! And how!

Even if they break a leg,

Who cares?

Papa says "yes!"

Mama says "no!"

Vo-de-o, vo-de-o, vo-de-o-do!

Don't be a snoop!

Don't be a droop!

Boop-e-doop, boop-e-doop, boop-boop-e-doop!

Cal has got the country boomin',

Down on Wall Street, stocks are zoomin',

Still he's so darn unassumin'!

Ha-ha! Hee-hee!

What a relief

You get when the rhythm has gotcha,

Hotcha,

Hail to the chief,

Hail to the chief,

He's our favorite son

And we hope that he'll run

In nineteen-twenty-eight,

'Cause he's great, great, great!
