Gentlemen Prefer Blondes


LORELEI

Don't you understand

That I've been true to you, but I'm in demand,

Because gentlemen prefer blondes like me?



GUS

But what am I to do

If they go on preferring you?



LORELEI

They buy me champagne

Because they say that they admire my brain.

Because gentlemen prefer blondes like me.



GUS

Do they discuss romance

Or is the subject high finance?



LORELEI

They'd take me out dancing,

Cross my heart, I wasn't in the mood.

But after all, when they'd call,

I just couldn't be rude.



GUS

Well, baby, I'm resigned

To having you for life, but no peace of mind,

Because gentlemen prefer blondes,

But the only blonde that I prefer is you.
