I'm A 'Tingle, I'm A 'Glow


GAGE

I don't smoke,

Never touch a drink,

But I'm sturdy as an oak

And I'm always in the pink.

I leap out of bed at the crack of dawn,

As graceful as an elk, as nimble as a fawn.

The life I lead would gladden

The heart of Bernard McFadden.



From head to toe

I'm alive, I'm a-tingle, I'm a-glow.

With the red corpuscles

Surging through my muscles,

I'm so full of pep, I overflow!

And I owe it all to roughage,

Rough, rough, rough, rough roughage,

I know the door to paradise

Is outdoor exercise.

In rain or snow

I'm alive, I'm a-tingle, I'm a-glow.

I start my day with a bowl of bran,

And the whole day through, I'm a happy man.

I laugh at care and woe,

I'm alive, I'm a-tingle, I'm a-glow.



I know full well

How Samson fell

Into Delilah's power,

So when I start

To lose my heart,

I just take an ice-cold shower.

I'm no Romeo,

I'm alive, I'm a-tingle, I'm a-glow,

I'm alive, I'm a-tingle, I'm a-glow.
