It's Delightful Down In Chile


SIR FRANCIS

Can you visualize a little hacienda

Where we could spend a

Weekend-a?



LORELEI

And I could pretend-a

That I'm a Chilean

To whom you'd lend a

Couple of million.



SIR FRANCIS

It's delightful down in Chile

Where the nights are nice and chilly,

And the golden moon is hanging low, oh.



LORELEI

Dai dai de dai dai, dai dai de dai dai,

I'd be such a

Sweet muchacha.



SIR FRANCIS

We could do a lot in Chile,

And it might get hot in Chile,

Even where the ocean breezes blow, oh.



LORELEI

Dai dai de dai dai, dai dai de dai dai,

Me amigo,

When do we go?



SIR FRANCIS

You, you would be beautiful there,

Wearing a rose in your hair.



LORELEI

Don't you think I ought to wear

Chin-chile?



SIR FRANCIS

It's just as nice in Piccadilly,

Or in Brooklyn or in Philly,

Or in Raleigh, or in Bali-Bali.



LORELEI

Dai dai de dai dai, dai dai de dai dai...



SIR FRANCIS

Oh, it would be rather jolly...



BOTH

Down in Chile on a chilly night.



SIR FRANCIS

I, I could be happy no end,

Think of the hours we'd spend.



LORELEI

Don't you think we ought to spend

Some pesos?



SIR FRANCIS

Yes indeed, it would be topping

If we found some time for shopping,

But of course, we'd have to stop for tea-a.



LORELEI

Dai dai de dai dai, dai dai de dai dai...



SIR FRANCIS

Mamma mia!



LORELEI

I'll si-see ya...



BOTH

Down in Chile on a chilly night.



SIR FRANCIS

But it's awf'ly nice in Paris.



LORELEI

There's a lot of spice in Paris

When a blondie feels like rondievoo-ing.



BOTH

Dai dai de dai dai, dai dai de dai dai,

We could do what we'd be doing...



WAITERS

Down in Chile, they'd be billing and cooing,

Down in Chile,

Way way way way way down in Chile,

So don't you think it's really kind of silly

To travel willy-nilly down to Chile

When in Paris, men are slicker

And his hands are mighty quicker

On a chilly night.
