A Little Girl From Little Rock


LORELEI

I'm just a little girl from Little Rock,

I lived on the wrong side of the tracks,

Till a gentleman took me out one night,

And after he'd taught me wrong from right,

We moved to the right side of the tracks.

Then someone done me wrong in Little Rock,

So I up and left old Arkansas.

Like a little lost lamb I roamed about,

I came to New York and I found out

The one you call your "Daddy" ain't your pa.

I was young and determined,

I was wined and dined and ermined,

Ev'ry night opportunity would knock.

And some of these days in my fancy clothes,

I'm a-goin' back home and thumb my nose

At the one who done me wrong,

The one who done me wrong,

The one who done me wrong in Little Rock.



I'm just a little girl from Little Rock,

But fate led me straight to Murray Hill.

And I suddenly had a charge account,

It amounted to quite a large amount,

But somehow I never got the bill.

Although I lost my heart in Little Rock,

I still wasn't smart about romance.

I've discovered since then that a girl in love

Usually gets a token of

A man's appreciation in advance.

Though my landlord adored me,

He was like a father toward me

Until I found he owned a city block.

And now that I'm known in the biggest banks,

I'm a-goin' back home and give my thanks

To the one who done me wrong,

The one who done me wrong,

The one who done me wrong,

I said the one who done me wrong,

The one who done me wrong,

The one who done me wrong in Little Rock.
