Homesick Blues


I'm so homesick,

And I'm three thousand miles from Times Square.

I hate cafe au lait,

This whole town is tres louse.

I'm Place Vendome-sick,

Fall asleep at the Folies Bergere.

It's all a lot of chichi,

I burp when I drink Vichy.

Here's to Tin Pan Alley,

A Yankee Rally,

A show like "Sally,"

And notwithstanding Rand McNally,

There's only one Broadway

On the map of the U.S.A.

Let's tell the gang we're coming

Back to old-fashioned kisses and modern plumbing,

I've got those I'm-so-homesick blues.



I miss Marilyn Miller in "Sunny,"

Jolson down on one knee,

Mary Garden and Gatti-Casazza,

Lovely evenings at the Plaza,

Watching a fighter like Dundy,

Cheering for May Bundy,

Nora Bayes in a bill at the Palace,

Teddy Roosevelt's daughter Alice,

Theda Bara,

Fiske O'Hara,

Palais Royal,

Standard Oil,

Man O' War,

Barrymore,

Fritzi Scheff,

Mutt and Jeff.

Belmont Track,

Cracker Jack.

We've stayed away too long

From gals like Sophie Tucker.

Texas Diamond won't be wrong

With that greeting: "Hello, sucker!"



Here's to Valentino,

The Park Casino,

The big Bambino,

The cigarettes called Melachrino,

Give me that old mainstem

And a song by the great George M.

I feel my heart beat faster

Anywhere in the neighborhood of the Astor,

I've got those I'm-so-homesick blues.
