Enemy At Port Side


MAJELLA

Grania, Captain

Things look bad

We've English sailors

Come on board!

Donal, Ma'am

The Man's a traitor

Holy God!

Protect us Lord!

Donal, yes, your husband

Wants us to surrender!



GRACE

Quickly now, I need my sword!



MAJELLA

(spoken)

No Grania. You can't; you can't move! You are too weak.



GRACE

(spoken)

I must go up there.



MAJELLA

(spoken)

No Grania you can't.



GRACE

(spoken)

Majella, give me my sword.



MAJELLA

(spoken)

No, you can't.



GRACE

(spoken)

Give me my sword.



(music to end of battle)
