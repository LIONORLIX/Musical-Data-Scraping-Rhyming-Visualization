The Pirate Queen


DUBHDARA AND CLAN O'MALLEY

Holy God

Bless this ship

With pride, and Clan O'Malley green,



DUBHDARA

I name this ship: "The Pirate Queen"

(Cheers)



DUBHDARA AND CLAN O'MALLEY

Give the girl a shot of whiskey

Set the pirate lady free

There are many clans in Ireland

Clan O'Malley rules the sea!

Tell the English merchant ships that pass here,

Treasure in their hold

That the Queen has come to liberate their gold!



TIERNAN

Chief Dubhdara's at the helm -

She's as sleek as she is fast



GRACE

I can feel her halyards creaking

As they strain against the mast

Feel the wind against my cheek



TIERNAN

Feel the ocean rise and fall



GRACE

I've seen many ships but she's

The most exciting ship of all



ALL

Holy God

Bless this ship



Here we sail, the Clan O'Malley

On the maiden Pirate Queen

In the whitecaps or the valley

We will pick the English clean

If the English planned to steal our land

They'll pay for it with war

As the pirates see

An Ireland free once more
