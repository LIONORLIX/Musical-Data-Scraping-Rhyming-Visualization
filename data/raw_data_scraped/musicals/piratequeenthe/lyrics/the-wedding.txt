The Wedding


EVLEEN

May God bless

The bride and groom

May he bless them both

Their love to bloom



MEN AND WOMEN

May He bind

Them Evermore

St. Patrick smile kind

Upon them both

And bless their union



May God bless

The bride and groom

On this day



(dance music)



May God bless

The bride and groom

On this day



(dance music)



May God bless

The bride and groom

May he bless them both

Their love to bloom



(The dancing reaches its climax and ends.)
