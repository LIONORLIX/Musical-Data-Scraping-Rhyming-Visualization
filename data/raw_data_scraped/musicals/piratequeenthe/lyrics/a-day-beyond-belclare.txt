A Day Beyond Belclare


GRACE

The man who gave me life

Is but and inch from death

With my heart torn in two

I go on my way

To hear the wisdom spoke

Upon his final breath



O'FLAHERTY WOMEN

All that you've seen us through

We now can repay

Off from Rockfleet with you

We go to Clew Bay



O'FLAHERTY CLAN

A day beyond Belclare

Your father waits for you

Clan O'Flaherty goes

With you to Clew Bay

As one we leave this day

To see our savior through

Joined as comrades and friends

We'll bond on our way

Marching through the Twelve Bens

And on to Clew Bay



GRACE

My father lies near death

You're by my side, is that a sign?



DONAL

This marriage joined two clans

Your father dies, his crown is mine



TIERNAN

Stand back and hold your tongue

Do you not see your wife's in pain?



DONAL

I only say what's true



TIERNAN

You think of her now

And not what you gain

Whatever you do

Remember that I'm

Watching you!



O'FLAHERTY CLAN

A day beyond Belclare

Your father waits for you

Clan O'Flaherty goes

With you to Clew Bay

As one we leave this day

To see our savior through

Joined as comrades and friends

We'll bond on our way

Marching through the Twelve Bens

And on to Clew Bay



A day beyond Belclare

Your father waits for you

Marching through the Twelve Bens

We go to Clew Bay...

Joined as comrades and friends

We bond on our way...

Marching through the Twelve Bens

And on to Clew Bay
