Sail To the Stars


EVLEEN

Seol chun farriage

(Sail to the sea)

Go Flaitheas de agus

(To God's Heaven)

Glor ne heireann

(And the glory of Ireland)

Seol, seol leat

(Sail away with you)

Doite sa tine

(Burned in fire)

O eirigh in eineach le dia

(Rise together with God)

O seol go samh le dia

(Sail peacefully with God)

Chun na realta...

(To the stars)



ALL

Sail to the stars

Off to glory, God

And the grace of Ireland

Go on your way

To your journey's end

In a veil of fire



A chieftan dies

A chieftan's born

As hearts are torn

A new light shines

Upon the morn...



And sail to the stars

Off to glory, God

And the grace of Ireland

Go on your way

To your journey's end

In a veil of fire

And take your place

In Heaven's light

Upon this night...



Go forth to the dawn

In the years ahead

They will tell the tale

Of you, of us all

On this night

Made one with the stars; set sail!
