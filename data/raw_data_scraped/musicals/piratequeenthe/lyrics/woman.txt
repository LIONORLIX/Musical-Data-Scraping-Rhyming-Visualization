Woman


GRACE

Woman I am born

What does "woman" mean?

Must my dreams face scorn

Held back and unseen



If I long for fire

Must it stay unreal?

Can I not desire?

Am I not to feel?



If I ache to taste

Am I not to try?

If my heary says sail

Why must I deny?

I have my dreams

I have made plans



I see horizons wide as a man's

Must I be nothing till I'm some man's wife?



Look at this face

Does it deceive?

Do I look made to milk and to weave?

I will be damned to Hell if that is my life!

(Interlude)

Tiernan,

I'm almost your age,

I'm your match in size,

I'm your match with swords

An equal in most eyes



But when you have a dream

And you're caught in it's grip

You can climb aboard a ship

You can -

You can for you're a man



You can reach toward that place

Where the earth meets the sky

Fight a battle be brave, be true

If you can do it, why not I?



I'm meant to fly

Sail unrestrained

Why is man free and woman chained?

Is that my epitaph before I die?



I should be free

Free to be Grace

I want to feel the wind on my face!

And when life beckons, I should go

Face out the storm, not stay below

Am I to be just woman? No! Not I!
