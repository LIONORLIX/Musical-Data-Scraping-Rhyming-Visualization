I'll Be There


What Do I Say?

What Do I Do?

How Will I Ever Hope To Fare?

How Can I Stay

So Close To You

Knowing Now That Your Place Is

In Another's Embraces,

In Another Man's Care?



I Should Be Gone

Far From This Hell

Till Not A Trace Of You Survives

Yet I'll Stay On

For I Know Well

Though You've Left Me Behind You

One Day Troubles Will Find You

And When That Day Arrives



I'll Be There

For To Me There's No Sorrow

Worse To Bear

Than A Life Lived Apart.

I'll Be There

Come The Mists On The Morrow

I'll Be There

By Your Side

And Deep WIthin Your Heart



He'll Keep His Wife

Dressed Up In Bows

Lavished Eternally With Flow'rs.

But Whatever Life

He Might Propose

Will Be Merely Pretending

To The Dream Never-Ending

That WIll Always Be Ours.



I'll Be There

Though I Know That It's Madness,

Heart Laid Bare,

Stripped Of Pride, Yet Still Proud.

I'll Be There

In The Depths Of My Sadness

I'll Be There

Ever Steeled

Unyielding And Unbowed.



Go And Marry A Man You Don't Love

If That Pleases You.

Throw Away, For A Cause,

All The Joys We Have Known

I Thought Love's More Than Faith,

More Than Clan, More Than Anything

Let His Kiss Keep You Warm

I'll Be Fine On My Own...



Is It Me I'm Deceiving?



Mad Or Not, I'll Stay True.

I'll Be There...



[Intrumental Measures]



I'll Be There, Heaven Speed Me,

By Your Side, As You Need Me

I'll Be There For You.
