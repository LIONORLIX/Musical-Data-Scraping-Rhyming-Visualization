Let a Father Stand By His Son


DONAL

Grania's child, of course, friends

Has another parent

Humbled in remorse, friends

Shamed as he was errant

Please let a father

Stand by his son



Mock me with your cheer, lads

Salt my wounds with slander

Have you not a tear, lads

For your old commander?

Please let a father

Stand by his son



As he grows

Through the years

Will my name

Be unknown?

Grania, you

Know what a father can mean

Is your heart made of stone?



Grania, for the child's sake

On this day of Christ'ning;

Please let a father

Stand by his son



GRACE

I suppose

My obligation is clear

Perhaps

You have the right to be here

I dismissed the husband

Cursed by his sin

The father, though

May come in



(English attack. Battle sounds, as lib screams, gun shots)



DONAL

Fool!

Did you think I'd lie down

Let a woman prevail

Be dismissed on command?!



GRACE

Fool

That I thought you could change!

In one final betray'l

Now you've turned on your land

Now, what will come of our ways?

Now, what will happen to Eoin...?



DONAL

Now, with my boy, I'll restore

Clan O'Flaherty's sway

Once the English have won!



GRACE

No!

Tiernan, steal him away!

Keep that beast from my boy!

Save my child, save my son!



BINGHAM

Cut

One throat and down it goes;

Clans

Collapse like dominoes

Now you see

How the game's played, your Majesty

Across this land

It will play out the same, your Majesty

And when

I give this land to you

I'll kneel

And you'll know what to do



(music to the ending)
