The Sea Of Life


GRACE:

On the sea of life

Trav'lers all are we

At it's mercy, to and fro

Where it takes us, there we'll go.

Tides may ebb and tides may flow,

yet steady stays the sea



I'll do what I believe, and pray, prevail.

I'll stay fast to my  course, succeed or fail,

And give my faith this night

To this, the sea we sail.



GRACE/ SAILORS:

On the sea of life

Trav'lers all are we

At it's mercy, to and fro

Where it takes us, there we'll go.

Tides may ebb and tides may flow,

yet steady stays the sea



SAILORS:

On the sea of life



GRACE:

I'm at home with the wind on my face!



SAILORS:

What can be, will be.



GRACE:

I've a place as a woman upon the sea!



SAILORS:

Sheltered in the brine's embrace



GRACE:

And this moment in time...



SAILORS:

Constant is the change we face.



GARCE:

... Won't be taken from me!



SAILORS:

Waves may come and waves may go



GRACE/ SAILORS:

Yet steady stays the sea.
