Finale


Grania:

Tiernan, at last

In your embrace

How many nights

Did i dream of this face

Seeing you now

Fighting back tears –

Finally as one

After so many years?



Tiernan:

Is this a dream,

My freedom i mean?



Grania:

All part of the truce

That i struck with the queen

So let us return to home this day

An ireland we hope will at last be free

The cost was dear but it’s time that we

Put the past behind us



Tiernan:

You are still grace



Grania:

Tiernan, my dear



Tiernan:

You look a sight



Grania:

You sir as well



Tiernan:

So much gone wrong

Yet my heart feels so light

Seeing you here, again within reach

I feel like a boy again, back on our beach

So often i recalled those days

Two children loosed on an irish shore

I see us now as we were before

If a little wiser



Grania:

I fought my wars on land and sea

To be a woman strong and free

I should have learned, at journey’s start,

No woman’s free who ignores her heart



Tiernan:

So before another hour slips past

Let’s put our feelings first, at last.



Grania and tiernan:

It’s time to stand and say once more

The words we tried to say before

I’ll say it now and i’ll swear it’s true

For once and for forever – i love you



Ensemble:

May god bless

The bride and groom.

May he bless them both.

Their love to bloom



Grania, tiernan and ensemble

And god bless ireland

May there be god’s peace at last

In our land
