Rah-Rah, Tip-Top


LORDS

(spoken)

Your Majesty!



BINGHAM

(spoken)

Your Majesty!



ELIZABETH

(spoken)

Lord Bingham. Lords. What news of our Empire?



LORDS #1 AND #2

Everything sails, your Highness,

Troubles in France are dead



LORDS #3 AND #4

Nothing in Wales, your Highness,

To bother the royal head



LORDS #5 AND #6

Taxes increase, your Highness;

Even when gained by force



BINGHAM

Ev'rywhere peace, your Highness;

Ireland aside, of course...



ELIZABETH

(spoken)

Ireland?



BINGHAM

(spoken)

Hardly worth mentioning.



ELIZABETH

(spoken)

No. No please, Lord Bingham, mention it...



BINGHAM

Well...

Only last week, your Highness

One of our ships attacked

Caught in a sneak, your Highness,

Boarded at dawn and sacked

Leave it to us, your Highness,

We'll locate the Irish ship

What's to discuss, your Highness;

Everything's...pip!



LORDS AND BINGHAM

Rah-rah, tip-top

Ev'rything's right as rain

Rah-rah, tip-top

Here in the Queen's domain

Sea to sea to sea

The English crown is holding sway



BINGHAM

Don't allow the Irish bog

To taint the royal day



LORDS AND BINGHAM

As it has been!

So shall it be!

God save the Queen!

England eternally



Rah-rah, tip-top

Perfectly in the pink!



ELIZABETH

(spoken)

The captain of this ship you cannot locate - what is his name?



BINGHAM

What's his name? I blush to testify

And oh, you're bound to laugh when you hear why

For, your Highness, it turns out, you see

That he ... is a she



ELIZABETH

(spoken)

What? A female captain?!



BINGHAM

Grace O'Malley is her name,

She strikes at night -

Countless cruel, bloodthirsty men

At her command

Were I not bound for Asia

I'd fix Ireland myself



ELIZABETH

If your true desire

Is to see Ireland

Brought to heel

We commission you

Lord Governor true

Of all of Ireland

Crush the clans

The pirates too



BINGHAM

(spoken)

But, your majesty...



ELIZABETH

Do not tha-a-a-a-a-ank me-

Kneel



LORDS

Rah-rah, tip-top,

Masterfully resolved!

One bold stroke, the

Matter of Ireland solved!



"Difficult," King Henry said,

"To govern like a king."

One day out, already

You've a handle on thing



As it has been!

So shall it be!

God save the Queen!

England eternally



Rah-rah, tip-top

So goes the old refrain

Rah-rah, tip-top

Ev'rything's right as rain!

Ev'rything's right as rain!
