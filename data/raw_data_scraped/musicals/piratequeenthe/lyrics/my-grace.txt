My Grace


DUBHDARA

My child, my Grace,

A stow'way on my ship

And what a fool you've made me



I'm proud! I am!

I'll put away the whip

But still - you disobeyed me



For flouting me

As any sailor knows,

I'd have him keelhauled through the water

But when I think

What judgment to impose

I only see my daughter



Grania at the fireside

If you stay

You know the crew's unease

The battles on the seas

And me - I'll want to shield you



GRACE

Father, please

Just let me have my start

When you were sick at heart

The ocean was what healed you



DUBHDARA

My Grania,

My daughter through and through

(makes his decision)

Let my judgment be made

And your brav'ry repaid:

You can stay till this voyage is through

And may God and this crew

Please forgive what I do

Dearest Grania...



GRACE

Dearest Captain...



DUBHDARA

Women are a myst'ry

Wild, elusive creatures

Twenty times a bother

Sometimes the closest to your heart

Are the ones you know least of



Now I see you standing

Fiery as your mother

Stubborn as your father

How can I chastise you for dreams

And hold your untaimed heart against you

When it's what I'm most proud of in me



Who can even imagine

The trials you will face

As you strive to live free



Be who you are,

For you're my Grace,

And you'll always be

(with ending)
