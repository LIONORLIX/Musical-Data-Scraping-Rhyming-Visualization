The Role Of the Queen


LADIES

White...



ELIZABETH

The white of virgin skin

Unblemished, powedered, blank

That hides what lies within

The image crowned with



ELIZABETH AND LADIES

Gold...



ELIZABETH

The color of my power

The scepter and the orb

Demands of state that flower

My anger flowing



ELIZABETH AND LADIES

Red...



ELIZABETH

Blood, lips, and blushing cheeks

This body made of flesh

Confining even me



LADIES

White, gold, red...



ELIZABETH

This fortress I create

Made from these pots of paint

No longer serves as it was meant to be



I stand divine

As the monarch clear

Yet on every side

Thund'ring words I hear:

"It's time that she

Wed a consort King"

To produce an heir

Is in fact the role of the Queen



LORDS AND LADIES

She stands divine

As the sov'reign soul

Placed by God Himself

In her royal role

In a child, they say,



Crown and flesh convene



To postpone that day

Has become the goal of the Queen



ELIZABETH

(spoken sing-song)

I love my new map.

Knowing better the topography of Ireland.

We've made great advances in the East.

But...

Why is it in the West

I am consistently defied by this...

Female!!!



BINGHAM

(spoken)

Not for much longer. Things are going according to plan, your majesty.

Soon we'll see the end of this so-called Queen of the

Pirates, this trousered pretender, this aberration of her sex.



ELIZABETH

This is your last cha-a-a-a-nce!



BINGHAM, LORDS AND LADIES

She stands divine

As the sov'reign soul

Placed upon the throne

By the hand of God

In sacrifice

She remains serene

In her ev'ry breath

She defines the role of the Queen
