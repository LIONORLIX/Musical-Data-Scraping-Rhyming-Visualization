Boys'll Be Boys


MAN #1

(spoken)

Donal, you were born to marry a queen! Too bad she's a ... Pirate!



DONAL

Clan O'Flaherty men,

It's touching to see you

Friends should share

A great occasion like this

With the dawn I wed my O'Malley beauty

I'll need help to face

The challenge

Of wedded

Bliss



I can see you're laughing at me already

My bride's been a captain running a crew

But there is a war, and war brings a duty

This calls for a man to do

What a man

Must

Do



Boys'll be boys,

Lads'll be lads,

Living the way God planned

Showing women how the world ought to be



MATES

Boys'll be boys,

Lads'll be lads,

How to get her in hand?



DONAL

Honest, friends, the answer's right there

Have you never broken a mare?



DONAL AND MATES

Boys are boys, and boys, that's how it should be



BARMAIDS

Boys'll be boys

That is no girl

How will a lad survive

She's a sort of lady shark, as it were

After the drums

Wedding night comes

Who will come out alive?

She's been a captain running a crew

She's killed people, ran 'em right through

Sorry, Donal, lad, I'm betting on her

(DONAL trumps the laughter at his expense.)



DONAL

(holds up a gold coin; spoken)

A gold sovereign says that I, Donal O'Flaherty, will have her eating oats out of my hand within a week!



(sung)

I'll be rough when she needs it,

Rough as seas ever were

Up to know she's been steering

Now it's time to steer her



She's confused about gender

She been too long "at sea"

I may well have to beach her

Take her inland and teach her

What a woman should be



DONAL AND MEN

Boys'll be boys



BARMAIDS

Girls'll be girls



ALL

Gotta have one last fling

Gotta cram a lifetime in before dawn



DONAL

Tragic it's not

Want to know what?

Marriage won't change a thing:

Listen, friends, a conjugal vow

Doesn't change a bull to a cow



DONAL AND ALL

Married man or not the party goes on
