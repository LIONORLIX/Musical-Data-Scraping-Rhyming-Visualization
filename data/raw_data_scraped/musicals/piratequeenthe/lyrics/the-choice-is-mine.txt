The Choice Is Mine


DUBHDARA

All the clans of Ireland

Are bogged down in ancient fueds



DONAL

Like the feuds your kinsmen once began



CHIEFTAN O'FLAHERTY

Donal!



DUBHDARA

Yes! And so the Queen of England

Sees us and concludes

We're too weak to fight her empire's plan



And so my friend, we must put old claims asside

And join as one, a course that's never been tried



CHIEFTON O'FLAHERTY

We must, but how?

That would call for trust

No trust have I



DUBHDARA

Nor I



CHIEFTON O'FLAHERTY

You know, as I,

How this work is done

You have a daughter,

And I have a son

These two must wed

And when there's an heir

Then two warring clans

Will at last be one



GRACE

Father, I know well what kind of victory this shows

Tell me, was my fate just sealed for me?

If you do accept this marriage union they propose

I must give up Tiernan and the sea

I fought so hard



DUBHDARA

You are selfless in war



GRACE

To carve a life that's mine



DUBHDARA

Give yourself like a man



GRACE

I love my land



DUBHDARA

But this fight calls for more



GRACE

Where Do I draw the line?



DUBHDARA AND GRACE

Who'll sacrifice

To become one clan?



DUBHDARA

A man cannot

A woman can



GRACE

(spoken)

Tiernan; please!

(sung)

The choice is mine

But I cannot refuse

It's cruel, the path

We are now forced to choose



TIERNAN

In the name of God!

This you cannot do!



GRACE

Tiernan - this must be

But my love still is you



TIERNAN

(spoken)

Grace! You promised yourself to me! Does that mean nothing to you?



DUBHDARA

(spoken)

Tiernan, it must be so.



GRACE

In this time of war

Two small lives must yield



Tiernan!



Our clan accepts -

Let the bond be sealed
