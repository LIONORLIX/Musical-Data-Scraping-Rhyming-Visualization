The Christening


PRIEST

We welcome you on this morning

Child of grania, little one

In the name of the lord, our father

And the spirit and the son.

PEOPLE OF CLEW BAY

May wishes and blessings be

Bestowed on this child at length

Of beauty and bounty and strength.

God bless you upon this morning.

All of ireland

Has a son.

May fairies attend your cradle.

Little owen.

Little one.
