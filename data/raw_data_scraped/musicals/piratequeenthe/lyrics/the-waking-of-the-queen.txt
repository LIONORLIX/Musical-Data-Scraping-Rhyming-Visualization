The Waking Of the Queen


ELIZABETH

Yesterday they crowned my head,

Anointed me as Queen

The girl that I once was is dead

And what is here

Must never be ... seen



Bring our robes

As we leave bed

Do not look, not once,

or it's your head!



Each day at dawn when I choose to arise

For one moment I'll stand here revealed:

Something female men crave and despise

Which must now be concealed



Men in England think a female can't rule

They think women lack the masculine will to lead

If my sex distracts them - I am no fool

They will only see the monarch they need
