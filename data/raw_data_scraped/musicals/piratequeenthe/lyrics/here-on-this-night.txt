Here On This Night


GRACE

Here on this night, my life begins

Starting tonight my life sails on

Tonight the dream I fought for wins

And I'm with you until the dawn



TIERNAN

I went to sea when I was ten

I'd sail the world for months or more

I would be leagues away, but then

I'd dream of you back on the shore

Now that you'll always be in sight

My life begins here on this night



GRACE AND TIERNAN

Take my hand

And make a vow

We are one

Together now

Far from home

Yet home we share

Land and sea

And heart and air

You and I,

We're Ireland on this night



TIERNAN

I want to speak my heart out loud



GRACE

Whe have to hide the things we feel



TIERNAN

That I will love you till I die



GRACE

How can we hide what's now so real?



TIERNAN

If we can't say it to the crowd



GRACE AND TIERNAN

We'll just declare it to the sky

In front of every star in sight

We start our life here on this night



Hand in hand

We'll keep our vow

We'll be one

Forever now

Far from home



Yet home we share

Land and sea

And heart and air

You and I

We're Ireland on this night



GRACE

The sky grows dark



TIERNAN

Our love grows bright



GRACE AND TIERNAN

And I am yours

Here on this night
