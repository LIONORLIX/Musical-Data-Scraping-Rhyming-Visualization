Back to Limmeridge


PERCIVAL GLIDE



Here use this pen

Sign here and here

And we'll be done



UNCLE



There is just the small question of my future

Limmeridge house has been my home for many years

You have no plans to sell, Sir?



PERCIVAL GLYDE



No immediate plans



UNCLE



Then my future here is assured?

I'm old sir and infirmed



PERCIVAL GLYDE



I am well aware of that



UNCLE



So you have no plans?



PERCIVAL GLYDE



I leave straight from here for a long sanget on the continent. My seat on the train is booked.

Sir, your signature.



UNCLE



Her estate is yours

Spend it wisely Glyde



PERCIVAL GLYDE



Thank you kindly sir



UNCLE



Tragic that she died

Stay and have one drink

In memory of my niece



PERCIVAL GLYDE



I have to catch my train



UNCLE



May she rest in peace



PERCIVAL GLYDE



But sir

I can't miss the train



UNCLE



Don't haunt me in this way

Brother I have done your dirty work for far too long

For years i've kept your secrets

I've brought up your children

They weren't mine

This has brought me ill health, unhappiness

That's your legacy!

I wanted no part of this



SERVANT



You can't go in there!



HARTRIGHT



We have some pressing questions!



UNCLE



Explain this rude intrusion!



HARTRIGHT



You must tell us who's Anne Cattrick!



MARIAN



Uncle you have got to help us!



UNCLE



I don't know what you speak of



HARTRIGHT



There's no more time for secrets



MARIAN



Long ago her mother worked here



HARTRIGHT



We won't leave without an answer



UNCLE



What presumption! Know your place sir!



HARTRIGHT



ALl along you've known the truth sir



MARIAN



Good God Anne Cattrick is dead sir!

She lies in Laura's grave



UNCLE



What nonsense you speak of!

It is Laura who is dead

God rest her soul!

My niece is dead



(Music begins to play on the piano. It is Laura's song)



What witchcraft is this?



LAURA



Come believe your eyes Uncle

I was placed in the asylum

Anne went to my grave

If you ever loved me Uncle tell me who she was



UNCLE



Your father loved the ladies

Anne's mother was a pretty one

You can guess the rest

Though you and Anne were born a year apart

You could easily have passed for twins

Save you were wanted

And she was not



LAURA



She was my sister?



UNCLE



Yes



LAURA



And Glyde killed her



UNCLE



What?



HARTRIGHT



He won't get away with this



UNCLE



I'm afraid he already has

He's on his way to the Continent

Your estate has already passed to him

He left just before you arrived



LAURA



What is this secret my sister spoke of?

Uncle do you know?



UNCLE



I assure you

I know nothing more

I'm sorry



LAURA



Then it is over

Glyde has won



HARTRIGHT



We can catch him

We can hit him off

He'll need to take the London train



MARIAN



I'll go with you

Laura you rest here



LAURA



No! I'll never rest again

We can stop him

I have a plan!

Anne shall haunt him

One last time
