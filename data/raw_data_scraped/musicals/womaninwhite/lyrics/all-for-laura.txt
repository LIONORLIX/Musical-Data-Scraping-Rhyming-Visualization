All for Laura


Laura:

Here the voices

Keeping me awake

Will i ever sleep again

Reassing everything i've done

Choices i can't explain



All for laura this is what i prayed

All for laura, have i betrayed you

With our old life forever out of reach

Look what i've lead you to,

God forgive me

Look at what i've done

Look at how i protected you

All for laura shouldn't i have know

I know one thing we are alone now

I sent away the man, the man we could trust

The only man we both love



All for laura, was it you who i was thinking of

All for laura, but at the start

Were you formost in my heart



All for laura, that's how i'll live

'Till i save, 'till you forgive me

I'll dedicate my life i swear upon my soul

I find way to set you free.



All for laura, till my dying breath as long as your in need of me

I will some how learn to be strong

I will live to right this wrong



Anne:

He must never win again

I can trust you and

Marian:

Anne:

Count fosco:

Wandering about in the dark and without an aid of the court.

You english ladies are so reclous with your midnight fliting.
