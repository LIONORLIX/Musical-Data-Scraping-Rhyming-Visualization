Evermore Without You


Ever on my mind

Evermore without you

I'll never know a thought or feeling That isn't about you

Nevermore alone

Never to forget you

Not when my life was changed forever The first time I met you

You're all I know

And though I've lost you,

You're someone I can't let go



Every living day

Ever filled with sorrow

How can I face a life without you

Or even tomorrow?

Evermore without you

Were we never meant to be?



Nevermore alone

Never to forget you

Not when my life was changed the first Time I met you

You're all I know

And though I've lost you,

You're someone I can't let go



Every living day

Ever filled with sorrow

How can I face a life without you

Or even tomorrow?

Evermore without you

Were we never meant to be?



Every living day

Ever filled with sorrow

How can I face a life

without you...



Evermore without you

We were never meant to be.
