If I Could Only Dream This World Away


If I could only dream this world away

I'd awake in your arms

If I could keep this bitter life at bay

Wide awake, in your arms

The vow that keeps me from you

I cannot undo

I'm lost

Lost in a fantasy that can't come true.



If I could only dream this world away

I'd awake in your arms

I'd long to sleep forever

Dreaming of only you

I'm lost

How many nights like this

Can I go through
