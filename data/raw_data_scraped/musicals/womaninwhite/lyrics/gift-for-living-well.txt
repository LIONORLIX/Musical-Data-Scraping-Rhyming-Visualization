Gift for Living Well


Fosco:  No, no, no! Well, if you insist.



Fosco:  I am a man

Of medicine

No opera star,

(with passion) My voice is thin

Though I play cards

And violin

At none of these do I excel.



The talent that

I have in spades

Is one for fun

And escapades

A gift for living well

Attracted to the lively arts

Breaking bread, breaking hearts.



(He looks at Marian)



Making love, when love has me spellbound.



(He takes some wine from a servant, fills his glass)



Italian food

The wines of France

I never walk when I can dance



(A small pirouhette for the ladies)



A gift for living well



A one man band

I sing the lead

Alwasy self-accompanied



(He plays a few chords on the piano)



I concede probably I'm hellbound



A bon vivant

As you can see

A lust for life as big as me!

A gift for living well.



Fosco: But enough about me! Raise your glasses



(Fosco raises his glass to the bride and groom)



Fosco: Sir Percival Glyde!



All: (raising their glasses) Oh what a joyous occasion this is!

Sir Percival Glyde!



Fosco: Dolce vita to you and your Mrs.!



Glyde: This is the moment I've longed for.



Marian: Everything's for the best now.



Mr. Fairlie:  I'll have an empty nest now.



All: And here's to the bride!

Cheers for the life they will lead from now...



(Hartright suddenly interrupts the toast - addresses Sir Percival Glyde)



Hartright:  Please let me speak

And forgive my interruption

Please hear me out

On a very pressing matter

One that concerns a girl

Her name is Anne, Anne Cath'rick

She says you've done her wrong

Have you an explanation?



Mr. Fairlie: What impertinence! Mr. Hartright, know your place sir!



Glyde: No, no, Mr. Fairlie, I am glad that he asked this. Please, please.

I am happy to clear up the matter of Anne Catherick...



Glyde: Her tale is truly sorrowful

And some would say a tragedy

Her story breaks my heart

I don't know where to start

Her mother was in my employ

(to Mr. Fairlie) Your brother recommended her

Recall, she worked here too?



Mr. Fairlie: Catherick? I'm not sure that I do.



Glyde: Anne was so sweet as an infant

She used to laugh all the time

She sparkled like the sun

Such a pretty one

Yet she grew up so unhappy

Sullen and angry and sad

She was a troubled child

Acting strange and wild

She once attacked her mother

When she was just sixteen

A fury with no pause

No one knew the cause

To help her grieving mother

And rescue Anne herself

I undertook her care

I tried to see her through

It was the Christian thing to do



When no physician could treat her

I found a haven that would

A trusted private place

To embrace her case

Anne thinks of me as her captor

When I am truly her friend

For all her care I pay

Still she runs away.



(Fosco who appears moved by the story shakes Glyde by the hand)



Fosco: I'm touched by your compassion

Your kindness knows no bounds.



Glyde: I've done the best I can

I've done my best for Anne.



(Once again Hartright speaks up)



Hartright: She spoke sir of a secret

A secret she would tell.



Glyde: Her world has come to be utter fantasy

But her safe return

Is my great concern

And I am grateful for

Your help.



Laura: Poor Anne.

Her story saddens me.



Marian: Yet it explains the mystery.



Fosco: Had it not been for Glyde

I'm sure she would have died.



Mr. Fairlie: No more please!

Neither Anne Catherick nor her silly mother are any of your business, sir.

And once more, my nerves are quite shot.



Fosco: Then a shot of brandy is what I prescribe, Signor!



Mr. Fairlie: Yes, let us retire at once to my study, gentlemen.



(Glyde, Fosco, and Mr. Fairlie leave.  Glyde bows his thanks again to Hartright)



Glyde: Thank you, sir.



(Hartright is left with the two women)



Hartright: I don't believe him

Can't you see he's clearly lying

As for your uncle

It's the truth that he's denying.



Marian: Sir, you must leave at once.

You must go right away.



Laura: But, Marian-



Marian: What reason has he to lie?

How can you hope to stay here?



Laura: Please Marian-



Marian:  Laura our future is settled

Soon you'll be Lady Glyde

You'll have a perfect life

As that fine man's wife

He is a man of compassion

Look how he helped that poor girl

He has integrity

He's all a man should be!



(Laura looks to Hartright)



Hartright: I clearly don't belong here

Your sister is quite right

I leave for London now!



(Laura runs out, upset)



Hartright: (to Marian) Are you happy now?



(He exits.  Marian left alone crumples, begins to cry)



Marian: I close my eyes and I still see his face.



(She exits)





The Tryst



(Hartright is there with his bags and easel, departing.

Laura enters in haste, wearing a white nightdress)



Laura: Tell me this isn't happening.  Tell me I'm walking in my sleep.



Hartright: I'm sorry.



Laura: I believe my heart

It believes in you



Laura and Hartright: Ev'ry part of ev'ry thought leads me straight to you.



(She gives him the sketch that he gave to her in the drawing lesson)



Laura: Take this...something to remember me by.



(He leaves)
