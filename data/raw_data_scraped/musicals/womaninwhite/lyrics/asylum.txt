Asylum


WOMAN



Yes?

What's your business here?



HARTRIGHT



We are representatives of Sir Percival Glyde

We're here to see Anne Cattrick.



MARIAN



I feel so nervous



HARTRIGHT



You've been so brave



MARIAN



There is something

I must say to you

Something i've held deep inside for so long



WOMAN



Only one of you



(the woman leads marian through the patients in the asylum to Anne)



Cattrick

You can have five minutes

Not that you'll get much sense from her



MARIAN

(marian approaches anne)



Anne?

Anne Cattrick



(Marian realizes that it is infact her sister Laura and not Anne Cattrick)



MARIAN



Laura?



LAURA



Marian? MARIAN!

(They embrace)



HARTRIGHT



How can this be?



LAURA



They held me down and drugged me

They dressed me in Anne's clothing



MARIAN



I was sure I heard some screaming

But they told me I was dreaming!



LAURA



They brought me here that evening

Underneath a cloud of darkness

Though I told them who I was

There was no one who believed me!



MARIAN



Then it was Anne they buried

Claiming it was you!



LAURA



What?



HARTRIGHT



There isn't time now

We must get out of here!

We've got to stop Glyde before he gets away!



I will redeem this pledge



LAURA



Marian I don't understand!

What have they done to Anne!

Tell me!



MARIAN



Oh Laura I am so sorry!

Anne Cattrick is dead!



LAURA



What?



MARIAN



I believe they killed her



HARTRIGHT



And put you in this asylum in her place



LAURA



Please God No!



MARIAN



Laura I am so sorry



LAURA



Then her secret has gone with her to the grave!



MARIAN



We musn't think about this now

We have to get you to safety



LAURA



But we must know her secret



HARTRIGHT



She's right

We have to go to Limmeridge



MARIAN



Limmeridge?



HARTRIGHT



We are but three miles away

And your uncle knows more than he's admitting

It's time for him to tell the truth!
