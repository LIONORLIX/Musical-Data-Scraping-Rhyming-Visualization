Seduction


SERVANT



Miss Marian Halcombe



(Fosco is pleasantly surprised. He shoos the servant away.

He slicks back his hair back, adjusts his smoking jacket.

The servant exits as Marian enters)



FOSCO



To what Miss Halcombe do we owe this honour?

Each successive day was getting duller



MARIAN

(as she takes her coat off, revealing her red dress to him for the first time)



Well I somehow thought you might be missing me



FOSCO



I must tell you scarlet is your color



MARIAN



I cannot spend all my life in mourning

Though in ev'ry way I miss my sister



FOSCO



Truly you display a healthy attitude





MARIAN



I'm for the first time on my own



FOSCO



Really you need not be alone

One should explore on'es playful side



MARIAN



You are a guide most qualified



FOSCO



I leave in the morning for the continent



MARIAN



In my provincial world I cannot be content



FOSCO



We could lead a life that would be well mis-spent



MARIAN



And I have no doubt that would be thrilling

But alas it seems my glass requires refilling



(Fosco takes her glass and re-fills it generously-as he does she quickly

and surreptitiously looks on his desk

for the document before hastily arranging herself on the sofa.

He hands her the drink)



MARIAN



Delicious!



Sir if I remove my shoes would that be shocking?



FOSCO



I'd be breathless as your buckles are undone

I would walk to warsaw just to see your stocking

And to see your shapely ankle I would run



MARIAN



You should know it took great courage for this visit

But I must admit that I am glad that I am here



FOSCO



And that dress you're falling out of is exquisite



MARIAN



Though I'm trembling it is clearly not from fear



FOSCO



It's apparent we were made for one another

We're each others moon and sun we're so well matched

Though my feelings aren't remotely like a brother

We are over twenty-one and unattached



MARIAN



I've been waiting all my life for an adventure



FOSCO



What in truth you have been waiting for is me

Let us begin our minuette



MARIAN



No looking back and no regret

Don't I deserve a life of bliss?



FOSCO (intimate)



Think of this as the precipice



(they kiss)



FOSCO



I can open up a world you've only heard of



MARIAN



Introduce me to a life beyond your dreams



FOSCO



We'll share secrets that we'll never breath a word of

And we'll take pursuit of pleasure to extremes



BOTH



You and I are willing to defy convention

You're my equal both in joie de vivre and wit

We find another worthy of attention

we don't care what others think of us one bit



(they kiss)



FOSCO



As a paramour I'm rather out of practice

But I'll rise to this occasion I embrace



MARIAN



But that bard of yours is rather like a cactus

May I save, if not my virtue then my face?

Would you kindly shave it off

Do be a darling?



FOSCO



Then i will fly back to your side just like a startling



(Fosco leaves to shave.

Marian dashes around the room looking for the document,

opening drawers etc.)



MARIAN (sotto voce)



Think, think Marian. Where is it? Where is it?



(she continues to look. She finds the document, reads it)



MARIAN (sotto voce)



Please! Yes!



(she does not have time to put the paper back, before she hears him approaching.

She hids it about her person.

Fosco re-enters, in the mood for love. She sits herself quickly.)



FOSCO



Now my chin is even softer than a baby

Let's resume this tete a tete from where we were



(She edges away from him)



MARIAN



Though my heart says yes my head's now saying maybe

And my feet are growing colder and concur



(She puts on her shoes again)



FOSCO



When I left this room were we both not on fire?

We'ren't we both about to give romance a whirl?



(She stands up)



MARIAN



On reflection I found out I'm

somewhat shy-er

And perhaps I'm not really that kind of girl



(Fosco pauses, looks at her intensely)



FOSCO



It appears that you have lost your taste for kissing

So I'd appreciate if you'd return what's missing



(Wordlessly she gives the document back to him. He holds onto her a moment)



MARIAN



Please. Please let me go. Please.



(He does so)



FOSCO



This game is through

You think you win

But think about

What might have been

If you had let romance begin

Instead of hiding

In your shell



One day you'll see

What you have spurned

My precious gift

That you returned

A gift for living well



Your every day

A great event

Living on the continent

Yes, it's true

I would have you

spellbound



(she looks away from him)



This game of hearts

You gladly trade

For solitaire

(with venom) and old maid

And so I say fare well



MARIAN



Someday your past will catch you up



FOSCO



Please don't let me keep you



(She leaves. He gathers up all his cases as he prepares for his final exit)



FOSCO



I can get away with ev'rything

Except the girl, perhaps

My epic charms have undergone

a temporary lapse



But when it's time to make an exit

and I am halfway out the door

As long as one is leaving anyway

then leave them wanting more



(he leaves)
