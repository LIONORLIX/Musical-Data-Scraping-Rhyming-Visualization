Holly and the Ivy


CHORUS



The Holly and the Ivy

When they are both full grown

Of all the trees that are in the wood

The Holly bears the crown

The holly bears a berry

As red as any blood

And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ

To do poor sinners good



The holly bears a prickle

As sharp as any thorn

And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ

On Christmas Day in the morn

The holly bears a bark

As bitter as any gaul

And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ

For to redeem us all



VOICE



NO!



CHORUS



The Holly and the ivy

When they are both full grown

Of all the trees that are in the wood

The holly bears the crown

Oh the rising of the sun

And the running of the deer

The playing of the merry women

Sweet sleeping in the cloud





Forever husband and wife

Dance of your life

Merrily Merrily

She is a source of pride in his arms

Pride in his arms

Merrily Merrily



Time for Rejoice and Time for Bliss

Dance to the bridge and groom!

Cheers to the Bride and Groom!

Here's to the Bride and Groom!

Lady Laura Glyde

Lady Laura Glyde

The church bells are ringing

They call out to warn you

But even my warnings were too late to save you

Now your fate is sealed

How can he be stopped?

You'll be the lady of Black Water House

All the rooms filled with sorrow

The lake filled with tear drops

Where you're at his mercy and he knows no mercy

I can't let this come to pass

I can't let you suffer as I did

I must journey to your side

So, unlike me,

You won't be friendless

So, unlike me, you won't be friendless



MARIAN



Welcome to your new home Lady Glyde!

Laura what is it?

Laura!

Something is wrong!



COUNT FOSCO



She is just tired



MARIAN



No I Must go to her!



COUNT FOSCO



Oh she will calm down

You live in her shadow!



MARIAN



If I do

Then It is because I am comfortable there



COUNT FOSCO



She is lovely

But you Miss Halcombe

Are beyond All compare



LAURA



Leave me alone

I don't need your help!



MARIAN



Laura you know you can trust me

Please let me know what is wrong

We seem so far apart and it breaks my heart!



LAURA



Trust you? Now why should I trust you?

When your advice led me here

Straight from the wedding prayer to complete despair!

He only wants my money!

That's all he wants from me!

Though he's a barronet

He is steep in debt

I'll show you how he loves me!

I think you'd want to see

His love is on display

A mark for every day'

You said he's all a man should be!
