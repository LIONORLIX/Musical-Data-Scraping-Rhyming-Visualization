Lammastide


ALL



Ripe golden fields and the

bounty the bring

Reason enough for to dance and to sing

Dance for who knows if we'll live till its spring

Sing

For it's Lammastide



(A young girl goes up to Laura and gives her a corn dolly)



ALL



Winds of the winter

As sharp as a thorn

Soon will assault us

As sure as we're born



GIRL



Who will protect us?

A doll made of corn



ALL



Dance!

For it's Lammastide



MEN



Please spend the season

Pressed in my arms

Rest in my arms



WOMEN



Merrily, merrily



We'll end the season

Wrapped in your arms



MEN



Trapped in your arms



WOMEN



Verily, verily



ALL



Ripe golden fields and the

bounty they bring

Reason enough for to dance and to sing

Dance for who knows if we'll live till it's spring

Sing

For it's Lammastide



MEN



Please end the season

Pressed in my arms

Blessed in my arms



WOMEN



Verily, verily

Although we may protest in your arms

We'll nest in your arms





ALL



Merrily, merrily



After we harvest the fruits of the earth

Time for the home and a moment of mirth



MEN



Time for a dance



WOMEN



And the chance of rebirth



ALL



Sing

For it's Lammastide

ALL



Ripe golden fields and the bounty they bring

Reason enough for to dance and to sing

Dance for who knows if we'll live till it's spring

Sing

For it's Lammastide!

Dance

For it's Lammastide!

Sing

For it's Lammastide!



(At the end of the song,

we see the same young girl being excluded from the festivities.

her mother scolds her and she does not enter the church with the others)



MOTHER (to little girl)



You'll wait outside till you see sense my girl
