Fosco Tells of Laura's Death/The Funeral/London


COUNT FOSCO



Miss Halcombe

It is behatch

I'm so terribly sorry

There is no easy way to say this

Your sister

She is dead

She was walking in her sleep



MARIAN



What are you saying! (sobbing)



COUNT FOSCO



She had sent her maid away

As is her custom I understand

She walked to her window

And she fell from a great height you see

It's a tragic accident

I am so deeply sorry

I am leaving for London today

If you need anything

Anything at all

This is where you'll find me



PRIEST (At the graveyard)



I am the life and the resurrection

Said The Lord

Who so ever liveth and believeth in me

Shall never die



SIR PERCIVAL GLYDE



How can the good Lord take my love away

Far too young

Far too good

I have to face forever

All without my love

There's no describing my sadness

She was the light of my life

And life is so unfair

Such a cross to bear

Still there's the will to contend with

All kinds of papers to sign

I can't believe she's gone

Yet we must go on



LAURA's UNCLE



How can you talk of business!

Good God it's much too soon!



SIR PERCIVAL GLYDE



Of course we'll wait a bit

That's appropriate



LAURA'S UNCLE



I'm much too overcome now

My nerves are simply flayed

Why don't you come to me

In June



SIR PERCIVAL GLYDE



Marian

I hope you still think of me as your brother



MARIAN



I don't believe a word

Everything he utters is a lie

I was powerless

Just a woman!

Too weak to save you!

I have no doubt he murdered you!

Laura!

You were all I had

I can't believe your gone

Where is Walter

He's the only one

You and I can count upon

All for Laura

I will be strong

I will live to right

This wrong



(On the Streets of London. Walter Hartright passes by a man begging on the streets)



BEGGAR



Spare me a penny

Sir



HARTRIGHT



This is my last one



BEGGAR



Then I won't deprive you



HARTRIGHT



Please take it

It's yours



WHORE

(offering hartright liquor)



It takes some comfort

It'll help you forget sir



HARTRIGHT



My thoughts and my memories are all I have left now
