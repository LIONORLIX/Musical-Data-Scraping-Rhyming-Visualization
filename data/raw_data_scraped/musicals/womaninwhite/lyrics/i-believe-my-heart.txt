I Believe My Heart


Hartright



Whenever i look at you

The world disappears

All in a single glance so revealing

You smile and i feel as though

I've known you for years

How do i know to trust what i'm feeling?



I believe my heart

What else can i do

When ev'ry part of ev'ry thought

Leads me straight to you



I believe my heart

There's no other choice

For now whenever

My heart speaks

I can only hear your voice



Laura



The lifetime before we met

Has faded away

How did i live a moment without you?

You don't have to speak at all

I know what you'd say

And i know every secret about you



I believe my heart

It believes in you

It's teling me

That what i see

Is completely true

I believe my heart

How can it be wrong

It says that what i feel for you

I will feel my whole life long



Both



I believe my heart

And it believes in you

It's telling me

That what i see

Is completely true



And with all my soul

I belive my heart

The portrait that it paints of you

Is a perfect work of art

I'm afraid it doesn't do you justice

There is no time for her to react however as)
