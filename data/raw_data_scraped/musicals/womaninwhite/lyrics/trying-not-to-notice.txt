Trying Not to Notice


(We are now in wilder couldtryside. It is hot.

Collars are undone, shawls are abandoned.

Hartright starts to sketch laura)





Marian



Sweet tension fills the air

Which i know i ought not dwell upon

I look away and still see him there

I'm trying not to notice him

Yet i can't help but stare



Hartright



No gazing!

Know your place

Words that i'd be wise to tell myself!

I close my eyes and i still see her face

I'm trying not to notice her

But i don't stand a chance



Laura



I'm trying not to notice him

Yet i return each glance

A thousand contradictions

Are stirring in my soul

They seem to grow in me

Overflow in me



Hartright



In spite of my convictions

I'm losing my control



Marian



I'm slightly shocked inside

Keep it locked inside



All three



Unspoken

Unexpressed

Still it's louder than a symphony

Can no one hear what my heart seems to shout?

Perhaps they do not notice it

Though it's as plain as day

I'm trying not to notice it

But it won't go away



(the end of the lesson... Marian and laura gather up their brushes and paints.

They go to exit-laura realizes that she has forgotten something.

She returns to where hartright is. They both linger for a moment)
