SIR PERCIVAL GLYDE



Hello!

You there!

Signalman!

Where in hell in the damn London train!



SIGNALMAN



I've heard reports there's trouble on the line!



SIR PERCIVAL GLYDE



That isn't expected!

My business here is over

I must make my connection

And why do you look at me in that way?

I've done nothing wrong!

What is that infernal noise!



SIGNALMAN



It's the wires singing in the wind

They're calling me with news sir

There's danger on the line!



SIR PERCIVAL GLYDE



This terrible nosie in my head!

Aahh!

Oh God, Anne Cattrick?

This isn't real

This cannot be

You do not exist

Get away from me!



ANNE CATTRICK



You know why I'm here

And what you must say

So you must confess



SIR PERCIVAL GLYDE



Woman Stay away



ANNE CATTRICK



Tell the truth Percival Glyde!

You'll hear my voice inside your head

For all you're life and when you're dead

You won't be free until you express what you have done

Till you confess

You cannot hide!

You can't go far!

Everywhere you go i'll be where you are!

I know what you've done!

We both know it's true!

Secrets must be told



SIR PERCIVAL GLYDE



I'm not afraid of you.



ANNE CATTRICK



Everything you did

Every one will know!



SIR PERCIVAL GLYDE



That's all in the past buried long ago



ANNE CATTRICK



Tell the truth Percival Glyde!

Didn't you use me and hurt me!



SIR PERCIVAL GLYDE



You were a beautiful girl

Like none i'd ever seen

You were just fifteen



ANNE CATTRICK



You and I both know the secret



SIR PERCIVAL GLYDE



Something that no one could prove

And who'd believe it's true

From the likes of you

You told me you were pregnant

You told me it was mine

It could have been alive

It deserved to die

I had to drown your bastard

I had no other choice

Before the child was due

I'd had enough of you

All that remains of your secret

Is buried in Black Water Lake

I watched as your disgrace

Sank without a trace



ANNE CATTRICK



You beat me and you raped me

And then you drowned my child!

When I was mad from grief you imprisoned me!

My precious little baby

My heart within my heart

The child I never knew

All because of you!

And then you threw away my life!



SIR PERCIVAL GLYDE



Your precious secret's meaningless

No one alive remembers you

And you can save your prayers

For no one truly cares

It's just like you were never born

And no one ever mourned for you!



('Anne Cattrick' takes off the white veil shielding her face and reveals

that it is truly Laura and not Anne Cattrick)



LAURA



You're wrong!

I mourned for Anne! Anne Cattrick!

And the child of yours that you destroyed!



SIR PERCIVAL GLYDE



Laura!



LAURA



This secret seals your fate forever!

And the charge that you can't avoid!

You have kept us both a prisoner!

But the truth has set us free

It will lock you up and damn your soul

For all of eternity!



SIR PERCIVAL GLYDE



You little witch

You think you can trick me?

Come here!

I killed her

And I can kill you too

And the beauty of it is

No one will ever know

Because you're dead!

You're already dead!



(Walter Hartright emerges from his hiding spot and he fights with Percival Glyde)



CHORUS



He's over there!

We know exactly what you've done!



HARTRIGHT



You see Glyde we all know what you've done!

You've found your own confession!

The game is over!



SIR PERCIVAL GLYDE



The game is never over!



HARTRIGHT



Don't go in there!

He said there's danger on the line!



(Sir Percival Glyde runs into the dark tunnel where an oncoming train hits and kills him)



SIGNALMAN



And a year to the day

The dead lie on the tracks

The dead lie on the tracks



MARIAN



You were so brave and now we're free



LAURA



It seemed like Anne was there with me

Her spirit was my guide

My sister by my side



MARIAN/LARUA



Within I know we'll never part

Her heart beats on within my heart



MARIAN



Go to her right away

That it where to belong!



HARTRIGHT



How can I ask your blessing

With all that we've been through

Our world has changed



MARIAN



You must find it in your heart

To over look what we've done

And make another start

Once again

As we were

If not for me

For Her



HARTRIGHT



Everypart of every thought

Leads me straight to you



HARTRIGHT/LAURA



And with all my soul

I believe my heart

The portrait that it paints of you

Is a perfect work of art



MARIAN



I close my eyes!

And I still see his face!
