Why Are All the D'Ysquiths Dying (Reprise)


LORD ADALBERT:

Why are all the D'Ysquith's Dying?

What could explain this tragic family curse?

A night or two ago

We were at Fidelio

He's stood and booed the mezzo

And today he's in a hearse!



If I should say I wasn't concerned

I would be lying

One doesn't like to think of one's demise

With such events you see

how fragile life can be

It rather makes me wonder if the

Next one will be me



ENSEMBLE:

So tell me

Why are all the D'Ysquith's Dying?



LORD ADALBERT:

The family tree's been whittled down to size



ENSEMBLE:

It's just a twig now!



LORD ADALBERT:

There's almost no one left to eulogize



ENSEMBLE:

Except for you, dear



ALL:

Let us pray no other D'ysquith dies!
