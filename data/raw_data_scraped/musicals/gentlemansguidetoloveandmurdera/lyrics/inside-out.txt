Inside Out


PHOEBE:

An oyster shell itself is unassuming

But look inside

You'll find a pearl

The man who otherwise is unpresuming

May share the same blood

As an earl



Do not dismiss so of an off position

She can be tenderhearted

I've no doubt

The world would be in awfully good condition

If we could all live

Inside out



Though belladonna is my favourite flower

I love its shape

And its perfume

You'd likely join the angels in an hour

Should you ingest

Its rather deadly bloom



The man who seems a paragon of virtue

May be a scoundrel

Better versed in sin

There may be many fewer who could hurt you

If we could all live

Outside in



And everyone you'd meet

On any London street

If they be sweet or horrid

It would show

I would be overjoyed

The hearty guide avoid

If I could look at you

And know



And when I meet the man for whom I'm fated

I'll know the one I've waited for is he

For he will find these wealthy trappings overrated

And he will see what no one sees in me

A girl who reads the classics a(aaaaaaaa)nd the sonnets

Who needs no folderol, it'll fill her cup

A girl who thinks a bit beyond her bonnets

He'll be of gentle heart

And good renown

He'll be the most admired man in town

He'll take a world that's mostly upside down

And turn it right side up



If we lived inside out



MONTY:

Or even outside in



BOTH:

The change in how we see would be immense



PHOEBE:

If we lived right side left



MONTY:

Or even left side right



PHOEBE:

Back side front



MONTY:

Or front side back



BOTH:

Would shed a better light

Black might just be white

Day might just be night

If we knew the truth about each other on sight



PHOEBE:

The world might just make sense
