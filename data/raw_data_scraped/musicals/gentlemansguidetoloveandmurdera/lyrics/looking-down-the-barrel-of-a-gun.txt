Looking Down the Barrel of a Gun


LORD ADALBERT:

When you're lookin' down the barrel of a gun

It concentrates the mind completely

And suddenly you'll find

A love for human kind

That makes you look upon the world more sweetly



When all at once it seems your life is done

You recognize it all goes by so fleetly

There's so much left to do

Except, of course, for you

When you're lookin' down the barrel of a gun



When you're lookin' down the barrel of a gun (CHORUS: Down the gun)

And the barrel looks right back at you demurely (Demurely)

With an eye that seems to say

Perhaps you ought to pray

So sorry that you're dyin' prematurely



You're grateful that you've had your share of fun (He's had his fun)

Though you suppose you might have lived your life more purely

It's ludicrous to care

It's neither here nor there

When you're starin' down the barrel of a gun



Oh, Lord, is this really your intention?

Aren't men like me in short supply?

Oh, Lord, I could use your intervention

This cannot be the way I'm meant to die



Do you really want to see me cryin'?



LADY EUGENIA:

Get up at once, you're making a spectacle of yourself!



LORD ADALBERT:

Eugenia. Put down the gun. Please. I know, I talk about game, bravery and courage, God save the queen and all that. But, I-I really don't want to die. I really, really don't!



Don't you know I've loved you like a son? (Like a son)

And I do not mean to say this impolitely (Do... say... politely)

Consider then, the view

I'd rather he'd presume

Looking down the barrel of a gun



Looking down the barrel of a (Barrel of a)



Uhhhh! (Dies.)



LADY EUGENIA:

Oh, for heaven's sake. Get up you old goat! Adalbert! Adalbert? (Gasps.) Adalbert!



MONTY:

What?



CHORUS:

Gun!
