I Don't Understand the Poor


LORD ADALBERT:

I say, you there. Hands off that sword. Put down that book.



Isn't it enough we let you look?



I hate to dash your futile, little hopes

But you pay your sixpence

And stay behind the ropes



I cringe when every cobbler

Or butcher

Or farmer

Comes touching my bannisters

Banging my armour



They finger every finial

They poke your cornerstone

Who'd want to be reminded

Of what they'll never own?



Though my politics are purely democratical

I find the species frankly problematical



I don't understand the poor

I don't understand the poor

The lives they lead

Of want and need

I should think it would be a bore



It seems to be nothing but stubbornness

So what's all the suffering for?

To be so debased

Is in terrible taste

I don't understand the poor



ENSEMBLE:

To be so debased

Is in terrible taste

I don't understand



To summarize the heretofor

He does not understand the poor



LORD ADALBERT:

I don't understand the poor

And they're constantly turning out more

Ever festering slum

In Christendom

Is disgorging its young by the score



I suppose there are some with ambition

Say the pickpocket, beggar or whore

From what I can tell

They do quite well

They're rising above

And it's work they love

But, I don't understand the poor



ENSEMBLE:

They're rising above

And it's work they love

But, I don't understand the poor



LORD ADALBERT:

Where's the dignity? (ENSEMBLE: Where's the dignity?)

Where's the pride? (Where's the pride?)

The ignominity (The ig...?)

Putting the lame and the halt aside

Why accept charity?

I am perplexed by their attitude

I contend we extend them too much latitude



My tenants have no excuse

At Christmas I give them a goose

Where's the integrity?

Where's the gratitude?



I don't understand the poor

How I long for days of yore

When nary a vassal

Stepped into your castle

They knew not to darken your door



Now they barge in every Tuesday

With a sickening, thickening roar

Why clatter and trample?

Set an example

We teach them to read

But do they succeed?

When they're hungry and frail

We feed them in jail

We send them off to war



I don't understand

I'm not being grand

I don't understand the poor



ENSEMBLE:

I don't understand

I'm not being grand



ALL:

I don't understand...



LORD ADALBERT:

Oh, there's one I admit I adore

He's missing a leg

But a very good egg

A gentleman through to the core



Well, he may be a bit of a drinker

He can often be found on the floor

Through all of his pains

He never complains

He's bright and astute

A shame that he's mute

According to mother

He may be my brother

A fact we all choose to ignore



But, I don't understand

I'm sensitive and

I don't understand the poor



ENSEMBLE:

I don't understand

I'm sensitive and

I don't understand



LORD ADALBERT:

They're a pox on the land!



ENSEMBLE:

I don't understand



LORD ADALBERT:

I don't understand



ALL:

I don't understand the poor



ENSEMBLE:

Don't understand



LORD ADALBERT:

Really I don't!
