The Last One You'd Expect


Jefferson Mays:

Look at him

No denying he's humble stuff

But it fills up this poor old heart

When I see how well he's done



Look at him

All the loyalty he has shown

How my fondness for him has grown

Till he's almost like a son



Some might have thought him unsuitable

How quickly he's earned my respect

Who would think that the D'Ysquith We cast aside

Could become such a source of pride

He's that last one you'd expect



Sibella:

Who'd believe that Monty Navarro ever would come so far, so fast?

Never seen a man so keen to over come his past



Now he can live in princely fashion, as the D'Ysquith name requires

He can pursue with all his passion everything he desires



I must go



Monty:

Will I see you again?



Sibella:

Well of course!

Some might have thought him unsuitable

They were of course incorrect.



I always believed in Monty Navarro even though in retrospect



Who would have guess whose bell I'd ring this very afternoon



Tomorrow?



Monty:

Tomorrow



Sibella:

Only just unpacked from my protracted honeymoon

He's the last one you'd expect



Women:

Miss D'Ysquith, pardon me, Mr. Navarro is here to see you



Pheobe:

Look at me

So completely in disarray

Barely able to face the day

Shall I say I'm in disposed?



Look at me

I'm so terribly gray and grim

Yet I'm cheered by the thought of him

Rather more then I'd supposed



Some might have thought him unsuitable

But what was me to object?

Who but he

Stood beside me to comfort me

Out of all of the family

He's the last one you'd expect.



Ensemble:

Look at him (look at him now)

No denying his humble start (who would have guessed)

But if fills up this poor old heart (I am impressed how he's progressed)

When I see how well he's done (a wife omits her obligations, is allowed to have her fun)



Look at him (look at him)

All the loyalty he has shown (look what he's shown)

How my fondness for him has grown (how my fondness has grown)

Till he's almost like a son (aaaaaaAAAAAaaaaa)



Some might have thought him unsuitable

But if they took a pause to reflect

They would seize

On his matchless ability

He's the best of the brink oh

He's the last one you'd expect



Monty:

Only two people left still alive who stand between the Eldum and me

Only two who survive who are still above me, on the D'Ysquith family tree



Is the next one my employer, Asquith D'ysquith?

But he has treated me so well

How ungrateful to remove him after all his kindness oh what hell



But remember he was hateful, Asquith D'Ysquith, was the cause of mothers grief

He denied her

Vilified her

Took away her birth right like a thief



On the other hand

Has he not been rather decent

Making me successor

Must admit I hate to do it

I've grown rather fond of him

And?



Pardon me Mr. Navarro, It is my sad duty to report that Lord Asquith D'Ysquith has gone to his great reward.



OH NO, what's happened?



Heart attack. At least he did not suffer sir.



Only one person left still alive that stands between the Eldum and me

(Only one, ONLY ONE, Only One, who stands between the Eldum and he)



Only one above me on the tree



Look at him (look at him)

Thanks to him I have been reveled

By his much true in fortitude

He's the last one you'd except



Spoken, Jefferson Mays:

After the tragic demise of Lady Salom√©, the sudden death of Lord Asquith D'Ysquith brings to seven the number of heirs to the D'Ysquith fortune who have died since last year.



Sibella:

Hmm? How very lucky for Monty Navarro



Ensemble:

How astounding



How Peculiar



It's astounding and peculiar

Yes how utterly peculiar



Monty Navarro, how have you come so very far?

Monty Navarro, earnest and circumspect

Monty Navarro, no one knows who you really are

Who would ever suspect



Monty Navarro, Monty Navarro, MONTY NAVARRO



I am the next Earl of High Herst and the last one you'd expect!
