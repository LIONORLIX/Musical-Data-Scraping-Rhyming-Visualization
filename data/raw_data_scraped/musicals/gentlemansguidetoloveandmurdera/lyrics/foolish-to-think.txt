Foolish to Think


(spoken) Pigs might fly...



(sung) Foolish to think she would marry you.

Why would she sink so low?

You've only a claim to a noble old name.

Who could blame her for saying "no"?



Foolish to dream she's in love with you.

You're a fool to believe that kiss.

The man who inspires such breathless desires, well, thats the man to dismiss.



Foolish to hope she would ever see

All that you really are.

A man with no trade is no match, I'm afraid.

For a blade in a motor car.

He'll go far...



Foolish to pray you will ever be

the fellow she might prefer

Lets have a drink! It's foolish to think you'll ever stop loving her.



On a mythical scale the D'ysquiths prevail on a hill just outside of town;

In a castle they love, that is so far above, they're accustomed to looking down.



And the fam'ly ordains that the blood in my veins is more than a trifle impure.

They conspired with each other, condemning poor mother to a heartbreaking life she could hardly endure!



With no conscience or care, they disposed of an heir to their glorious family tree.

Do I lie down and die, or determined to try to alter the course of my destiny?

Otherwise what will become of me?



Am I foolish to think I could ever be, will i never be more than I am today?

I can see me as a man of respect, you could never detect had once been so heartlessly cast away.



Am I foolish to dream I'll be Earl one day?

A towering man among men.

Then who could deny, now and then, pigs can fly!

Who will look foolish then?



Who will look foolish then?
