A Warning to the Audience


ENSEMBLE:

For those of you of weaker constitution

For those of you who may be faint of heart

This is a tale of revenge and retribution

So if you're smart

Before we start

You'd best depart

You'd best depart



An usher fainted in the aisle

A nun from Leicester lost her wits

You might avoid the first or second row



Blood may spill

And spines may chill

It's ghastly - still

We thought you ought to know

It's only just past eight

It's not too late

For God's sake!

For God's sake

For God's sake go!
