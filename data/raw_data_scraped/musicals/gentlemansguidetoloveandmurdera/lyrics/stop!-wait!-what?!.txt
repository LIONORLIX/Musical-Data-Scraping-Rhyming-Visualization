Stop! Wait! What?!


CONSTABLE:

So sorry to interrupt such a festive occasion, but I'm under strict instructions to arrest you - for murder.



MONTY:

Murder?



Stop! Wait! What?!

Well, I didn't kill Adalbert D'Ysquith

Though that certainly was my intent

Rather haunted, I jest

That I could be arrested

For something that I only meant



And it couldn't be poor cousin Asquith

For he graciously died on his own

Was that hole in the ice

Just a bit too precise?

Was my presence at Chisolmire known?



Murder, did you say?



CONSTABLE:

I'm afraid so, your Lordship.



Stop! Wait! When?!

I should doubt I was seen in the harbor

Lady Hyacinth fell in so fast

As for Salame's end

All suspicion would send

Them at once to that backstabbing cast



Did the beastings reveal my deception?

Was I seen at the weight lifting hall?

How rude to intrude

On this lovely reception

For I am the Earl after all



Yes, I am the Earl after all

Though it's come, I concede, at a cost

But, where was my blunder

My weakness, I wonder?

Is all of it now to be lost?

Is all of it now to be lost?



Murdering whom?



CONSTABLE:

Lord Adalbert D'Ysquith, eighth Earl of Highhurst.



MONTY:

Stop! Wait! Who?!

For the murder of Adalbert D'Ysquith?

Were there ever a farce, this is it

I am almost amused

I should stand here accused

Of a murder I didn't commit



But surely, the Earl died of a heart attack.



CONSTABLE:

Um, no, your Lordship. It was foul play.



MONTY:

Of course, I should like to inquire

By what method he happened to die

But what is the point

When events now conspire

To lead them to think it was I?



I dispatched half a dozen

Each one a cousin

All of them quite by design

It is not a defense

It just makes no sense

This murder was not one of mine!
