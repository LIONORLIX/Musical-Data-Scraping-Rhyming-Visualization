Why Are All the D'Ysquiths Dying


MOURNERS:

Why are all the D'Ysquiths dying?

What grisly sort of plague is going round?

It seems with every day

A D'Ysquith slips away

And here we are assembled putting another one in the ground



It's frankly all been rather mystifying

Do forgive me if I scoff:

But is it not a trifle odd

How they've all gone off to God

Suddenly they're congregating underneath the sod



Oh, why are all the D'Ysquiths dying

What a tasteless way of showing off



Why are all the D'Ysquiths dying

It seems that all of London's shaken to the core

To lose one relative

One can certainly forgive

But how can you excuse losing two

Or three

Or four

Or seven



Why are all the D'Ysquiths dying

I've never seen such recklessness before

It's unnerving

It's not that they're not undeserving

I never liked them much, I must confess

In fairness

You must admit, at least,

It's a shame about the priest

I can't imagine missing someone less



But really, why are all the D'Ysquiths dying

When truth to tell so many others should

Though

Privately it was said

They should all drop dead

No one thought

They ever really would



I happened to notice there wasn't a lot of crying

I even heard a snigger from the back

Oh, it really is a shame

How they start to feel the same

How many are there left to bury after what's-his-name?



I ask you



Why are all the D'Ysquiths dying

Whoever's next, I swear I won't come back

I'm utterly exhausted keeping track

And most of all, I'm sick of wearing black!
