Poor Monty


SIBELLA:

Monty, it's so strange

Everything will change

Think how our lives will be

I don't know what you'll do without me



Poor Monty

You're awfully handsome and smart

Poor Monty

You'll rise above

You'll put the loss of Sibella behind

And you will find

Someone better to love



Poor Monty

Have I just broken your heart?

Poor Monty

Am I to blame?

It may look bleak

But in a week

I'll wager you'll have forgotten

My name



I think I can picture her now

Young and willing

Oh, it's thrilling

In a way, you'll have me to thank

She'll be perfect

A shopgirl, a teacher

The sister of a preacher

Or a widow with cash in the bank



Poor Monty

Cozy in a cottage for two

Oh, Monty

Soon there'll be three

Nothing will stop

Your ascent o'er the top

You'll own your own shop

Monty, I guarantee

And I'll rue the day

I turned you away

And I will say

To myself

Poor me



I can picture us now

Very grand

In demand

Always somewhere exciting to go

All of Mayfair will imitate us,

Love us and hate us

For being the people people want to know



My husband

Will grow distinguished and gray

My husband

Will always be

Straight as a line

Steady and fine

Totally mine

Unfortunately

Dry as a bone

An insufferable drone

Dull as a stone

Poor me
