Poison in My Pocket


You and I go sailing by, and no one will know where to find us

Unseen, unknown, and blissfully alone

We're leaving the riffraff behind us

All afternoon in our sweet cocoon

Our care for the moment at bay

Side-by-side, who knows how far we'll glide

Bid the world goodbye --- fly away ?



I am standing here with poison in my pocket

Standing on this frozen little dock-

It seems that I've just let them skate my opportunity away

If I had the poise to put the poison in a pot of tea or else a shot of gin

I would be back amid the noise of london by the end of day



But,

I am standing here with poison in my pocket

One eye on the target, one eye on the clock

It better happen soon before I lose my nerve and run

If I had a knife I could have grabbed him

And discreetly knocked him on the head and stabbed him

Not to mention what I would have done if I had had a gun



Then again,

The thought occurs if I had truly taken stock

It might have stopped me from putting poison in my pocket

What a fool to travel all this way and not think twice

Murder's not a hobby for the cautious

Thoughts of violence can make the timid nauseous



Gasp,

Unless of course the victim plunges head-on through the ice

It appears that I've been handed quite an opportune solution

And all that still remains is proper execution

I had better join them on the lake before it gets too late

Suddenly there is no stumbling block

It means that I won't need the poison in my pocket

What a stroke of luck, Sibella teased me till I learned to skate



Curse her now ?

Time is racing now

Time is racing on

It's all a matter of pacing

In a moment, this moment will be gone



(--------------------------------------------------------------------------

As to create a hole in which the tragic lovers meet their doom)

You and I go sailing by, and no one will know where to find us



(One could call this rather diabolic

Is it strange? to feel a little melancholic)

Unseen, unknown, and blissfully alone



(A twinge of some remorse- of course a consciounce I assume)

We're leaving the riffraff behind us



(But, no! As I'm cutting, I am contemplating

And the truth is, it's a tad exhilarating)

All afternoon in our sweet cocoon



(Even though it is not so unconceivable that I'll be gone?)

Our care for the moment at bay



(Still it comes as quite a shock the ----?

That I'll be standing here with poison in my pocket )

Side-by-side, who knows how far we'll glide



(------------------------------)

Bid the world goodbye --- fly away ?



Away

All of this is frankly, easier than I had thought
