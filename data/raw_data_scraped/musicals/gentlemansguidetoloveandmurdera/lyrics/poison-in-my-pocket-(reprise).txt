Poison in My Pocket (Reprise)


MONTY:

I am standing here with poison in my pocket

look who's head head is finally on the block

it seems that now at last the moment i've been waiting for is here



All that's really left to be decided is the dish to put the poison in, provided i can do what must be done discreetly when the coast is clear.



I confess it pains me some to run someone's cooking oh, for god's sake, now another servant's looking, i have had a run of luck but this one does require skill



Fish or fowl, it must be well-selected so that no one else at all will be affected

what an awful waste to do in someone i don't want to kill
