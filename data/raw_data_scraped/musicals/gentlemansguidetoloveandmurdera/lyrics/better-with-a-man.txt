Better With a Man


Henry:

When a fellow needs a little helping hand

Who'll be there? It's almost guaranteed

No one else could ever really understand

Only another man knows what you need

And when a man has fallen down upon his knees

In such a moment, who'd be better than

Someone who's self controlled

Someone who's strong and bold

Someone who's good as gold

It's better with a man



Monty:

Better with a man



Henry:

Then you agree, my friend.



Monty:

Indeed i do.



When a man is lonely, he can always find

Another man who's feeling just the same (henry: that's it. Yes, he can.)

Drink will help you get your troubles off your mind

You'll both be buying before you know his name (oh, blotto and squiffy!)

And in that rousing climax when your horse comes in (come on, ponzo. Come on, ponzo.)

Who will cheer as loudly as he can (i will.)

Only a man would see

The meaning of victory

Oh, the comraderie

It's better with a man



Henry:

Better with a man



Both:

Women have much to recommend



Henry:

Lord knows i've had my share

Heh heh



Both:

But when a fellow needs a friend



Henry:

That's a totally different affair



Monty:

Women are soft against your skin

They're awfully nice to nestle with



Henry:

But when the sport is masculine



Both:

You need a man to wrestle with



Gentlemen have secrets they will never tell

Oh, they will never tell

They'll never tell their wives



Henry:

Married men know there are things you must not say



Both:

Discretion is the only way that love survives



Men are always there

Always there to share

And take good care

As mates, as brothers

Take a look at us

It's been ever thus

Since boarding school began



Henry:

Women are too complex



Monty:

Women too often vex



Both:

Men are a simpler sex



Henry:

It's better with a man



Monty:

Better with a man



Henry:

Better with a man



Both:

Better with a man



Bottoms up!
