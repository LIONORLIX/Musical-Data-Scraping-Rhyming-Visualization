Come Along With Me


VERSE.

From down to up,

About this town,

I've drunk my cup

From up to down,

But being a connoisseur

And a great social pet,

The circle which I prefer

Is the dilettante set.

Come along, little lambkin, do

Let me show it to you.



REFRAIN

If you want to pass through the gilded gates

Where the bourgeois meet the sophisticates

To exchange their views and to compare their mates,

Come along with me.

If you'd like to sup with a rich cocotte

Where the best bohemians go a lot

'Cause her wine is sparkling though her wit is not,

Come along with me.

Come along with me, my pretty,

Let me open your eyes,

In this great big wicked city

It is folly not to be wise.

And if any night, baby, you would care

For an intellectual love affair,

I'll improve your mind if you let down your hair,

Come along, woof, woof,

Come along, woof, woof,

Come along with me,

Woof!



REFRAIN 2

We can go to dine with an old marquise

Who delights in putting her guests at ease

By receiving only in a pink chemise,

Come along with me.

There's a prince whose home has become a must

For the lower men of the upper crust

'Cause his high-born wife has such a low-cut bust,

Come along with me.

When you meet these folks, my pretty mate,

You will like them a lot.

All their titles are legitimate

Tho' their children often are not.

And again I say, baby, if you'd care

For an unconventional love affair

Plus a boudoir full of fancy underwear,

Come along, woof, woof,

Come along, woof, woof,

Come along with me,

Come along!



REPRISE

Just be nice to him, baby, never fear,

He's the chic-est critic in Paris, dear.

If you want to help me have a great career,

Go along with him.

He is fond of you, though I must confess

1 don't understand it, but nonetheless

If you'd see your Boris as a big success,

Go along with him.

Go along and do your duty

Like the good girl you are,

Go along with him, my beauty,

Go along and don't go too far.

Still if he should try making love, ch?rie,

Be as cozy with him as you can be,

You can still be technically true to me.

Go along.



HILAIRE:

Woof, woof!

BORIS:

Go along.

HILAIRE:

Woof, woof!

BORIS:

Go along with

HILAIRE:

Woof!

BORIS:

Go along with

HILAIRE:

Woof, woof, woof, woof,

Woof, come along with me.

BORIS:

C'est la vie!
