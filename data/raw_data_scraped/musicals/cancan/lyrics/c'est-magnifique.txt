C'est Magnifique


PISTACHE:

Love is such a fantastic affair,

When it comes to call,

After taking you up in the air,

Down it lets you fall,

But be patient and soon you will find,

If you follow your heart, not your mind,

Love is waiting there again,

To take you up in the air again.



When love comes in

And takes you for a spin,

Oo-la, lala, c'est magnifi-que.

When, ev'ry night

Your loved one holds you tight,

Oo-la, lala, c'est magnifi-que.

But when, one day,

Your loved one drifts away

Oo-la, lala, it is so tragi-que,

But when, once more,

He whispers, "Je t'adore,"

C'est magnifi-que!



VERSE 2

ARISTIDE:

When you began of love to speak,

I followed every word,

But when you called love magnifique,

I would have called it absurd,

And when you said it was often tragique,

I would have said it was always comique,

So, mad'moiselle, be sweet to me

And kindly do not repeat to me.



When love comes in

And takes you for a spin,

Oo-la, lala, c'est magnifi-que.

When, ev'ry night

Your loved one holds you tight,

Oo-la, lala, c'est magnifi-que.

But when, one day,

Your loved one drifts away

Oo-la, lala, it is so tragi-que,

But when, once more,

He whispers, "Je t'adore,"

C'est magnifi-que!
