I Love Paris


VERSE

Ev'ry time I look down

On this timeless town,

Whether blue or gray be her skies,

Whether loud be her cheers

Or whether soft be her tears,

More and more do I realize



REFRAIN



I love Paris in the springtime,

I love Paris in the fall,

I love Paris in the winter, when it drizzles,

I love Paris in the summer, when it sizzles,

I love Paris ev'ry moment

Ev'ry moment of the year.

I love Paris,

Why, oh, why do I love Paris?

Because my love is near.
