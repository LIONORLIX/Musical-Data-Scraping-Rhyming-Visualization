Introduction & Maidens Typical Of France


INTRODUCTION

Monsieur President,

Monsieur President,

Monsieur President,

Monsieur President:



REFRAIN 1

We are maidens typical of France,

In a convent educated.

From the wicked clutches of romance,

We have all been segregated.

We know how to sew, we know how to knit,

We know how to read-at least a little bit,

We know how to wash, we know how to clean.

If also we know the difference between

A pair o' panties and a pair o' pants

We are maidens typical of France.



REFRAIN 2

We are maidens typical of France,

In a convent educated.

From the wicked clutches of romance,

We have all been segregated.

We know how to sweep, we know how to dust,

We know how to stew-a rabbit if we must,

We know how to bake, we know how to fry.

If also we know a tart is not a pie

It is because we had the lucky chance

To be maidens typical of France.



REFRAIN 3

We are maidens typical of France;

In a convent educated.

From the wicked clutches of romance,

We have all been segregated.

We're a11 very pure, we're all very good,

We all try to do exactly as we should,

We all go to church, we all say our prayers,

And if, when we dance, we show our derri?res

It is to show that, even when we dance,

We are maidens



POLICEMEN:

They are maidens

ALL:

Typical of France.
