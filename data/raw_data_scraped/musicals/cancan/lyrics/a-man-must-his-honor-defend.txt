A Man Must His Honor Defend


BORIS:

I've been grossly insulted by a cowardly lout

And the lout must be dealt with in a duel, no doubt,

Though the reason for this I do not at all comprehend.



BOYS:

A man must his honor defend.



BORIS:

When I think of a bullet running 'round in my brain,

In a brain so creative that my rivals complain,

'Stead of fighting Jussac, maybe I should make him my friend.



BOYS:

A man must his honor defend.



BORIS:

If this blood-curdling battle I am fated to lose,

It is tragic to know I'll not be able to use

All the money Claudine on my lovely casket will spend.



BOYS:

A man must his honor defend.



BORIS:

I can picture my fun'ral, quite the greatest in years,

All the gentlemen in frock coats, all the ladies in tears,

But I'll snub that Jussac if he has the nerve to attend.



BOYS:

A man must his honor defend.



BORIS:

I'm too charming to die, I'm too handsome to rot

In the family plot which my family has not,

I'm so popular here, ev'ryone loves me so!



BOYS:

No, no, no, no--no, no, no, no,

If you're doomed to go, then you're doomed to go.



BORIS:

Well, if this be your answer and the deed must be done,

Please produce my opponent and procure me a gun,

I am ready for action no matter what be the end,

A man must his honor defend.



BOYS:

A man must his honor defend



BORIS:

A man must his honor de, de, de, de, de, de, de, defend.



BOYS:

Defend!
