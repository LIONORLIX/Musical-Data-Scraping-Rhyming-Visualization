Live And Let Love


VERSE

Since tyranny we overthrew

At the fall of the Bastille,

If you tell a Frenchman what to do

Or if you tell him what not to do

He will only give one look at you,

But the look will be nasty.

For France will always curl her lip

At those who block her way,

And to ev'ry form of censorship

The French will always say,

"Vive la libert?!"



REFRAIN

Live and let live, be and let be,

Hear and let hear, see and let see,

Sing and let sing, dance and let dance.

I like Offenbach, you do not,

So what, so what, so what?

Read and let read, write and let write,

Love and let love, bite and let bite,

Live and let live and remember this line:

"Your bus'ness is your bus'ness and my bus'ness is mine."



REFRAIN 2

Live and let live, be and let be,

Hear and let hear, see and let see,

Drink and let drink, eat and let eat.

You like bouillabaisse, I do not,

So what, so what, so what?

Pray and let pray, slip and let slip,

Dress and let dress, strip and let strip.

Live and let live and remember this line:

"Your bus'ness is your bus'ness and my bus'ness is mine."



REFRAIN

Live and let live, be and let be,

Hear and let hear, see and let see,

Sculpt and let sculpt, paint and let paint.

I like lavender, you like blue,

J' m'en fou, j' m'en fou, j' m'en fou!

Cheer and let cheer, shoosh and let shoosh,

Pull and let pull, push and let push,

Live and let live and repeat now and then:

"Tes affair-es sont tes affair-es et mes affair-es

sont-les miennes."
