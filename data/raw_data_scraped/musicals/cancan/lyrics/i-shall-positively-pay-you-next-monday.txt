REFRAIN 1



PISTACHE:

Though I have not a single sou

In my stocking or my shoe,

I shall positively pay you next Monday.

Though not a centime I possess

In the bodice of my dress,

I shall positively pay you next Monday.

If but look you will

At my empty till,

Ev'ry eye will fill with tears,

So run along and take a stroll,

Though I have to sell my soul,

I shall positively pay you next Monday.

In her garden once so green, m-m-m,



PISTACHE:

Though she has nothing left to eat, m-m-m,

But an old petite marmite, m-m-m,

I shall positively pay you next Monday.

Though to smile I try,

From starvation, I

Am about to die, my dears.

So go away and please behave,

Though she may be in her grave, m-m-m,
