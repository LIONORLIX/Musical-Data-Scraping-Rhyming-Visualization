Ode to Attention Seekers


PHILIP

Hello everyone, I'm Philip... Always the bride, never the groom...



PHILIP

I'm known in all the wrong places

I'm one of those faces

You'll never forget

And those who may not adore me

Could never ignore me

I'm placing a bet

I can be real shallow if I try

But there's so much more to me than meets the eye

My manner can be misconstrued as trite

I'm irrepressible - a creature of the night

These rags don't tell the whole story

I live for the glory

Of turning your head

And while I have your attention

I'd kill for a mention

In the popular press

I'm the holy mother of invention

I'm so hip I never need to try

The perfect cure for your anal retention

I'm unforgettable

A creature of desire



PHILIP

You've got it all wrong

I think I've met your sister, Cinderella

I know what would look good on you, me! Huh, right



FREAKS

I'm known in all the wrong places

I'm one of those faces

You'll never forget

I'm known in all the wrong places

I'm one of those faces

You'll never forgetYou'll never forget!
