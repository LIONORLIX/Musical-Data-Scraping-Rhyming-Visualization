Stranger in This World


BOY GEORGE

I'm turning my back on this life for as long as I can,

Someone make me star 'cause I sure as hell can't be a man,

I'm too fragile and clever you know

And this universe just leaves me cold

I'm just hanging around here, I'm longing for someone to hold

You always knew didn't you Mother

You always knew as mothers always do

You always knew didn't you Mother

I was a stranger in this world

This dumb education was never quite part of my plan

So you left me to ruin but I'll always know who I am

I'm too fragile and clever you see

And your universe just leaves me cold

I'm just hanging around here, I'm longing for someone to hold

You always knew didn't you Mother

You always knew as mothers always do

You always knew didn't you Mother

I was a stranger in this world

Whoever told you that these were the days of our lives?

The sweet boys they crumble, and the wicked ones rise and survive

And they're running our lives, yes they're running our lives

You always knew didn't you Mother

You always knew as mothers always do

You always knew didn't you Mother,

I was a stranger in this world



On a clear day, I can see myself for miles

Oh Mother, oh Mother

On a clear day

Oh Mother, Oh Mother, Oh Mother...
