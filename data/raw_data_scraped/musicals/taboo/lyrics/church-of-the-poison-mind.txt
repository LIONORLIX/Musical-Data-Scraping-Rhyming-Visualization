Church of the Poison Mind


Desolate loving in your eyes

You used an made my life so sweet

Step out like a God found child

I saw your eyes across the street



Who would be the fool to take you

Be more than just kind

Step into a life of maybe

Love is hard to find



Chorus:

In the church of the poison mind (x4)



Watch me clingling to the beat

I had to fight to make it mine

That religion you could sink in neat

Just move your feet an youll feel fine



Who would be the fool to maybe

Trick a kiss in time

Who am I to say thats crazy

Love will make you blind



In the church of the poison mind (x3)



Desolate loving in your eyes

You used an made my life so sweet

Step out like a God found child

I saw your eyes across the street



Who would be the fool to take you

Be more than just kind

Step into a life of maybe

Love is hard to find
