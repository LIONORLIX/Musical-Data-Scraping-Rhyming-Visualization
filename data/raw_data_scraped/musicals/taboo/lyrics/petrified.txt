Petrified


PHILIP SALLON

Hate the way you look at me

Like you can tell so much about my lifeMy life

Assassinate so carelessly

So assured how sweet you twist the knife

Don't you know I'm just a lot like you

I need all the Godly things that you do

When you're alone, at night, do you run and hide?

Are you strong, inside, are you full of pride?

Or just petrified

Hate the way you look at me

But I can see the terror in your eyes

Your eyes

You pull the trigger

Your smile is sweet

But I don't care if we never meet

That's fine

It's alright

Don't you know I'm just a lot like you

I need all the Godly things that you do

When you're alone, at night, do you run and hide?

Are you strong, inside, are you full of pride?

Or just petrified

When you're alone, at night, do you run and hide?

Are you strong, inside, are you full of pride?

Or just petrified

Take a look at your life

Take a look in my eyes

Take a look at your life

Take a look in my eyes

Take a look at your life

Are you petrified...
