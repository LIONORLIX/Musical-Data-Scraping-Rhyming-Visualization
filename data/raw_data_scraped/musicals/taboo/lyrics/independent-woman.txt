Independent Woman


JOSIE

I got away from him

I never thought I could

Sweet independence tastes so damn good

He said I was useless

Just a waste of space

I believed it

I lived it

I wore it on my face

Now look at me

The dark clouds are gone

I got my pride backAnd I'm moving on

Independent woman

A casualty of love

I'm wounded and I know it

But I'm strong enough

Independent woman

Now I really see

For the first time in my life

I'm really me



JOSIE, KIM, PHILIP

Independent woman

A casualty of love

I'm wounded and I know it

But I'm strong enough

Independent woman

Now I really see

For the first time in my life

I'm really me.

Independent woman, independent

For the first time in my life

I'm really me, me, me

I'm really me
