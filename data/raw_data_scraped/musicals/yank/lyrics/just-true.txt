Just True


Don't run away Mitch

You can't outrun this

Run from me if you feel you have to...

You can't run from you



Don't you see?

What he have... is special

What we are is not



We're two of thousands

Hundreds of thousands

I'm surprised as you

It isn't something good... or bad...

Just true



Listen Mitch

We're in a battle we never planned

But we're together

Fighting together, that's what people do

Which isn't right or wrong

Just something true



No going back, not now

Too many know to go back and hide

To go back in disguise

Hundreds of thousands

Who felt lost and alone before

Have found each other in the war

Now we're wise

The freaks are us

Us regular guys!



You can't unlearn what you know is true

I'm glad they see us

If they can see us means that we can too

They'll have to understand

We've earned our due

And that's just true

Just true
