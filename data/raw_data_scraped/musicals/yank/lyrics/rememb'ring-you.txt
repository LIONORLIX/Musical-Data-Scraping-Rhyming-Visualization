Rememb'ring You


MITCH:

I was not like other guys

Early to bed, early to rise

I was a man about town

Dancing till dawn came creeping

Now my dancing shoes instead

Are safe at home beneath my bed

And I just pace the bedroom floor

It's one, it's two

It's three, it's four...



I can't seem to fall asleep, my darling

I keep rememb'ring you

Even as I'm counting sheep, my darling

I keep rememb'ring you

Through the day, I may keep moving

Searching high and low

For someone new

But I'm afraid I'm in too deep

No matter what I do

I keep rememb'ring you



S.:

A journal, over 70 years old, and I found it... or it found me. I stayed up all night looking on eBay for Yank magazines that might have his byline.



MITCH:

Still awake...

And still rememb'ring you



S.:

God, this song, rattling in my head...



MITCH:

Five o'clock, six o'clock

I get up, I make coffee ? make do

All day long I'm always tired

Hoping please tonight

I'll catch a few

But then...

'Neath starlight's silver beams

When you should fill my dreams

I'm up rememb'ring you
