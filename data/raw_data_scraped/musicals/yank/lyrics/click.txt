Every glove has a mate made for it

STU:

We click we're travelers

Thumbin' the same ride

Play the same game

For the same side

Common interests

Common set of needs



We click, our lips

Are willing and able

Let's play Ping-Pong

'Neath the table

Couple rounds and darling

We'll see who leads!



I'm not sayind you're the love of my life

I'm not saying there are stars in your eyes

All I'm saying is it's time to get wise

The world's at war

Rules are suspended

Whole world's... upended

STU:

ARTIE:

The army lists forbidden bars

In every town and state

Go to those bars... They're ours!



Army's got a lotta spies

But seldom at the local Ys

Change to your civvies

And wait in the privies!



STU:

Wait, why am I in the washroom?



ARTIE:

Part of our crew?

Tap your footsy

See if he taps too



STU:

Say, your hands touch over the sink?



ARTIE:

Ask him if he's feeling pink!

Say, he's tall and strong and swarthy?



STU:

Ask him if he's a friend of Dor'thy!



ARTIE:

Now you got it kid!



I can't give you caviar and champagne

And our future ain't our friends throwing rice

But I'll give you half an hour of paradise!

Who you'll wanna mess with

With a press pass

Dreaming the same drem too, who...
