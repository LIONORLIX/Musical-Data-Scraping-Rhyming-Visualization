Betty


TENNESSEE:

Jus look at that ? could you put her away and sleep? Not me ? I can tell she's ready for some Tennessee lovin':



Darling Betty, you look soft as can be

Helpless as a calico kitten caught in a tree

I'm breathless, I'm sighin'

There's no denying

I enjoy what I see ? lucky me!



MITCH:

Darling Bettyh, maybe you'll understand



BOTH:

We're as lost and lonely as sailors

Six months from land



MITCH:

And restless as that little lamb

When Mary's outta sight

I need someone to hold tonight



ALL:

Betty, Betty

Months, years I'll be without it

'Cept for you on demand



TENNESSEE:

...And my hand!

How'm I s'posed to sleep tonight

Surrounded by guys?



CZECHOWSKI:

Darlin' Betty

If you only were here

I would kiss you ?



MITCH:

Hold you ?



TENNESSEE:

And whisper

Soft in your ear



CZECHOWSKI/MITCH/TENNESSEE:

And all the sweet forbidden things

The army don't allow

I'd try on you tonight

Hold you good and tight

This sleeping car would be all right

If you were here with me tonight



TENNESSEE:

Give my back my Betty!



MITCH:

Stu's turn.



CZECHOWSKI:

You got a girl, Stu?



TENNESSEE:

Maybe Stubie's a v-i-r-g-i-n-n.



CZECHOWSKI:

Gimme another picture, this one's sticky.



TENNESSEE:

I got some extra Betties

You want front or back?



CZECHOWSKI:

Back!



MITCH:

Front!



TENNESSEE:

Two Lana Turners, if she's more your style

Veronica Lake's peek-a-boo smile

You can take 'em all

And I don't need 'em back

As long as there's Betty

Right here in the sack



CZECHOWSKI:

I'll take the Rita Hayworth

Hear she's Mexican!

Rita's too good for Orson Welles!

Hey wouldja fuck Deanna Durbin?

I'll take 'em both

Plus Lena Horne!

Give me until morn!



TENNESSEE:

Not my

Gorgeous Rita!

Well there's Deanna Durbin

If you like 'em young

I like 'em young!

Ladies give me one kiss



MITCH:

Hear she's a se√±orita!

Gorgeous!

Got any singers?

Judy Garland's mine!

They're all of them pretty

The whole damn pile

Wish there was one here to cuddle...



How 'bout you, sweetheart?

You've been awful glum

Don't none of these pin-ups

Speak to you, chum?



STU:

Darling Betty

Do your magic on me

Make your hips

Your kissable lips

Exciting to see

And all the good and normal things

That other fellas do

You'll make me wanna do



Betty. I like Betty.



MITCH:

Betty's got her hooks in him too!



TENNESSEE:

Woo hoo!



STU:

Darlin' Betty,

You look soft as can be

Lying like a calico kitten

Caught in a tree

And restless

As that little lamb

When Mary's out of sight

I need someone to hold tonight



MITCH:

Now you've chosen one

A kitten caught in atree

So far from sight

Need you tonight



TENNESSEE:

Body is achin'

I need you

Your lops heavenly

Squeeze you tight



CZECHOWSKI:

Can you feel me near

Give me just a moment alone

But don't tell Ethel



ALL:

Steady! Steady!

For I'm liable to burst

Your ass so rosy and round

And renowned!



TENNESSEE:

Now Betty Davis is fine for your Pa!



CZECHOWSKI:

And Betty Crocker is fine for your Ma!



STU:

And Betty Hutton is cute as a button!



ALL:

But as for me, give me Grable!

She's the Betty of mine!

How I wish here body was here

Wich which to entwine



CZECHOWSKI:

A piston needs a place to pump!



TENNESSEE:

A rooster needs a hen!



ALL:

But here there's only men

Men and men again

So dreams'll have to hold me tight

Tonight! Tonight! Tonight!



TENNESSEE:

Goodnight.



CZECHOWSKI:

Goodnight.



MITCH:

Goodnight.



STU:

Goodnight.
