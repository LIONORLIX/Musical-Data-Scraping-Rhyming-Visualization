What I've Been Looking For (Reprise)


Troy:

It`s hard to believe

That I couldn`t see

You were always there beside me



Gabriella:

Thought I was alone

With no one to hold



Both:

But you were always there beside me

This feeling?s like no other

I want you to know



Chorus

Both:

I`ve never had someone that knows me like you do

The way you do

I`ve never had someone as good for me as you

No one like you

So lonely before I finally found

What I?ve been looking for
