Bop to the Top


Sharpay:

I believe in dreamin`

Shootin` for the stars



Ryan:

Baby to be number one

You`ve got to raise the bar



Sharpay:

Kickin` and a scratchin`

Grindin? out my best



Ryan:

Anything it takes

To climb the ladder of success



Both:

Work our tails off every day

Gotta bump the competition

Blow them all away



Sharpay:

Yeah we`re gonna



Both:

Bop, bop, bop

Bop to the top



Ryan:

Slip and slide and ride that rhythm



Both:

Jump and hop hop ?til we drop



Sharpay:

And start again



Zip zap zop

Pop like a mop



Ryan:

Scoot around the corner



Both:

Move it to the groove

`Til the music stops

Do the bop bop, bop to the top

Don?t ever stop

Bop to the top



Gimmie, gimmie

Shimmy shimmy

Shake some booty and turn around

Flash a smile in their direction



Sharpay:

Show some muscle



Ryan:

Do the hustle



Both:

Yeah we`re gonna bop, bop, bop

Bop to the top



Ryan:

Wipe away your inhibitions



Both:

Stump, stump, stump do the rump



Sharpay:

And strut your stuff



Both:

Bop, bop, bop

Straight to the top

Going for the glory

We`ll keep stepping up

And we just won`t stop

`Til we reach the top

Bop to the top
