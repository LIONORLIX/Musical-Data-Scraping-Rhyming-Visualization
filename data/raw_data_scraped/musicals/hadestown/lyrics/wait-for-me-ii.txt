Wait For Me II


[HERMES, spoken]

Meanest dog you’ll ever meet -

It ain’t the hound dog in the street.

He bares his teeth and tears your skin

But brother, that’s the worst of him.

The dog you really got to dread

Is the one that howls inside your head.

It's him whose howling drives men mad

And a mind to its undoing.



[PERSEPHONE, spoken]

You think they’ll make it?



[HADES, spoken]

I don’t know.



[PERSEPHONE, spoken]

Hades, you let them go.



[HADES, spoken]

I let them try.



[PERSEPHONE, spoken]

Then how ‘bout you and I?

Are we gonna try again?



[HADES, spoken]

It’s almost spring.

We’ll try again next fall.



[PERSEPHONE, spoken]

Wait for me?



[HADES, spoken]

I will.



[COMPANY]

Wait for me, I’m coming

Wait, I’m coming with you

Wait for me, I’m coming too

I’m coming too



[HERMES, spoken]

You got a lonesome road to walk.

It ain’t along the railroad track.

It ain’t along the black-top tar

You’ve walked a hundred times before.

I’ll tell you where the real road lies:

Between your ears, behind your eyes.

That is the path to Paradise,

And, likewise, the road to ruin.



[COMPANY]

Wait for me, I’m coming

Wait, I’m coming with you

Wait for me, I’m coming too

I’m coming too

Wait, wait-



[EURYDICE]

Wait.

Wait...
