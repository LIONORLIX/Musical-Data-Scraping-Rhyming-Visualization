I Raise My Cup


[PERSEPHONE]

Pour the wine and raise a cup

Drink up, brothers, you know how

And spill a drop for Orpheus

Wherever he is now



Some birds sing when the sun shines bright

My praise is not for them

But the one who sings in the dead of night

I raise my cup to him



Wherever he is wandering

Alone upon the earth

Let all our singing follow him

And bring him comfort

Some flowers bloom when the green grass grows

My praise is not for them

But the one who blooms in the bitter snow

I raise my cup to him



[COMPANY]

I raise my cup and drink it up

I raise it high and drink it dry



[PERSEPHONE]

To Orpheus and all of us

Goodnight, brothers, goodnight
