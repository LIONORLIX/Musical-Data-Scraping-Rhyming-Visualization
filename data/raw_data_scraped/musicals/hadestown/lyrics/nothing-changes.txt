Nothing Changes


[FATES]

Why the struggle, why the strain?

Why make trouble? Why make scenes?

Why go against the grain?

Why swim upstream?



It ain’t, it ain’t, it ain’t no use

You’re bound, you’re bound, you’re bound to lose

What’s done, what’s done, what’s done is done

That’s the way the river runs



So why get wet? Why break a sweat?

Why waste your precious breath?

Why beat your handsome brow?

Nothing changes

Nothing changes

Nothing changes anyhow
