[ORPHEUS]

Gather 'round, you vagabonds

Pickin' fruit and hoppin' freights

Anyone who's wondering,

Wondering why the winds have changed

I'll sing a song of a love gone wrong

Between a mighty king and queen

Gather 'round and I'll sing a song

Of Hades and Persephone



Oh, queen of flowers

Queen of fields

Queen of the green and the growing Earth

Lady Persephone, half of the year,

Was bound to stay down in the Underworld

In the other half, she could walk in the sun

And the sun, in turn, burned twice as bright

Which is where the seasons come from

And with that cycle of the seed and the sickle

And the lives of the people

The birds and their flights, singing:

La la la la la la la...
