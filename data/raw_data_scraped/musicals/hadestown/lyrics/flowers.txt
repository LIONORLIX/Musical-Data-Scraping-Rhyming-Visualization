Flowers


[EURYDICE]

What I wanted was to fall asleep

Close my eyes and disappear

Like a petal on a stream,

A feather on the air



Lily white and poppy red

I trembled when he laid me out

"You won’t feel a thing," he said, "when you go down"



Nothing gonna wake you now...



Dreams are sweet until they’re not

Men are kind until they aren’t

Flowers bloom until they rot and fall apart



Is anybody listening?

I open my mouth

And nothing comes out

Nothing, nothing gonna wake me now



Flowers

I remember fields

Of flowers

Soft beneath my heels

Walking in the sun

I remember someone

Someone by my side

Turned his face to mine

And then I turned away

Into the shade



You, the one I left behind

If you ever walk this way

Come and find me

Lying in the bed I made
