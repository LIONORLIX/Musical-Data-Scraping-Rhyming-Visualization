His Kiss, The Riot


[HADES]

The devil take this Orpheus

And his belladonna kiss

Beautiful and poisonous

Lovely, deadly

Now it thickens on my tongue

Now it quickens in my lung

Now I’m stricken, now I’m stung!

It’s done already!



Dangerous this jack of hearts

With his kiss, the riot starts



All my children came here poor

Clamoring for bed and board

Now what do they clamor for?

Freedom! Freedom!

Have I made myself their Lord

Just to fall upon the sword

Of some pauper’s minor chord?

Who will lead them?



Who lays all the best laid plans?

Who makes work for idle hands?



Only one thing to be done

Let them think that they have won

Let them leave together

Under one condition:

Orpheus, the undersigned

Shall not turn to look behind

She’s out of sight

And he’s out of his mind



Every coward seems courageous

In the safety of the crowd

Bravery can be contagious

When the band is playing loud

Nothing makes a man so bold

As a woman’s smile and a hand to hold

But all alone his blood runs thin

And doubt comes...

Doubt comes in
