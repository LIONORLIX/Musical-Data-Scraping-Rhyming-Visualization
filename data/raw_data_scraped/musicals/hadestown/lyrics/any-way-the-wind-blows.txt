Any Way the Wind Blows


[FATES]

In the fever of a world in flames

In the season of the hurricanes

Flood will get you if the fire don’t

Any way the wind blows



And there ain’t a thing that you can do

When the weather takes a turn on you

‘Cept for hurry up and hit the road

Any way the wind blows



Sister's gone, gone the gypsy route

Brother's gone, gone for a job down south

Ain’t nobody gonna stick around

When the dark clouds roll

Any way the wind blows



In the valley of the exodus

In the belly of a bowl of dust

Crows and buzzards flying low

Any way the wind blows



No use talking of the past, it’s passed

Set out walking and you don’t look back

Where you’re goin’ there ain’t no one knows

Any way the wind blows



Sister's gone, gone the gypsy route

Brother's gone, gone for a job down south

Gone the same way as the shantytown

And the traveling show

Any way the wind blows
