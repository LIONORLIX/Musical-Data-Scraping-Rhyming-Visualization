Stonecutters Cut It on Stone


Jigger

I've never seen it yet to fail

I'll never see it fail

A girl who's in love with a virtuous man

Is doomed to weep and wail

Stonecutters cut it on stone

Woodpeckers peck it on wood

There's nothin' so bad for a woman

As a man who thinks he's good!



Nice talk!



My mother used to say to me

When you grow up, my son

I hope you're a bum like your father was

'Cause a good man ain't no fun!



Jigger and Men

Stonecutters cut it on stone

Woodpeckers peck it on wood

There's nothin' so bad for a woman

As a man who thinks he's good!



Enoch

'T ain't so!



Jigger

'T is true!



All

'T ain't so!



Jigger and Men

'T is true!



Carrie and Girls

I've never seen it yet to fail

I'll never see it fail

A girl who's in love with any man

Is doomed to weep and wail.



Girl 1

They're even worse after they marry you!



Girl 2

You oughta give 'im that ring back, Carrie!

You'll be better off!



Girl 3

Well, he's a mighty, unmarried man,

You should take 'im!



Carrie

The clock just takes your life away

There's no relief in sight

It's cookin' an' it's scrubbin'

An' it's sewin' all day

An' God knows what in all night!



Girls

Stonecutters cut it on stone

Woodpeckers peck it on wood

There's nothin' so bad for a woman

As a man who's bad or good!
