Geraniums in the Winder


Jigger

[Mr. Snow]

Geraniums in the winder

Hydrangas on the lawn

And breakfast in the kitchen

In the timid pink of dawn



And you to blow me kisses

When I'm headin' for the sea

We might have been a happy pair

Of lovers, mightn't have we?



And comin' home at twilight

It might have been so sweet

To take my catch of herring

And lay 'em at your feet



I might have had a baby-



[Jigger]

What!



[Mr. Snow]

To dangle on my knee

But all these things

That might have been

Are never, never to be.
