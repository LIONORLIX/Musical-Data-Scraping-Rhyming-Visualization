Give It to 'Em Good, Carrie...


Girls:

Give it to 'em good, Carrie

Give it to 'em good



Carrie:

Get away you no account nothing's

With your silly jokes and prattle

If you packed all your brains in a butterfly's head

They'd still have room to rattle



Girls:

Give it to 'em good, Carrie

Give it to 'em good

Tell 'em somthin' that'll learn 'em



Carrie:

Get away you roustabout riff raff

With your bellies full of grog

If you packed all your brains in a polywog's head

He'd never even grow to be a frog



Girls:

No, the pollywog would never be a frog

That'll learn 'em, darn 'em



Man:

Now just a minute ladies

You got no call to fret

We just asked you politly

If you was ready yet

We'd kinda like this clambake to get an early start

And wanted fer to tell you

We went and done our part



A group of men:

Look at them clams



A different group of men:

Been diggen 'em since sun up



The first group of men:

Look at them clams



Another different group of men:

All ready for the boats



First group again:

Diggin them clams



Yet another group of men:

We're all worn out and done up



All men:

And what's more we're hungry as goats



Girls:

You'll get no drink or vittles

Till we get across the bay

So pull in your belts and load up them boats

And lets get under way

The sooner we sail

The sooner we start

The clambake 'cross the bay
