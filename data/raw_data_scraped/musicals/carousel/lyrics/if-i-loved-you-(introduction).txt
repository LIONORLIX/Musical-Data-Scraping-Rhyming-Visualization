If I Loved You (Introduction)


Billy

Ain't you scared of me? I mean, after what that cop said about me

takin' money from girls?



Julie

I ain't scared!



Billy

Is that your name Julie, Julie, hmm hmm, somethin'?



Julie

Julie Jordon-



Billy

You're a queer one, Julie Jordan,

Ain't you sorry that you didn't run away?

You can still go if you wanna,



Julie

I reckon that I care to choose to stay!

You couldn't take my money if I didn't have any

And I don't have a penny, that's true.

And if I did have money,

You couldn't take any

'Cause you'd ask an' I'd give it to you!



Billy

You're a queer one, Julie Jordan,

Have you ever had a fella you give money to?



Julie

No!



Billy

Ain't you ever had a fella at all?



Julie

No!



Billy

Well, you must have a fella you went walkin' with



Julie

Yes!



Billy

Where'd you walk?



Julie

Nowhere special I recall-



Billy

In the woods?



Julie

No!



Billy

On a beach?



Julie

No!



Billy

Did you love him-



Julie

No, I've never told you anyone, I told you that.



Billy

Aha! You're-Your're a funny kid!

Hey, you wanna go to town dance maybe or...



Julie

No! I have to be careful!



Billy

Of what!



Julie

Of my character... You see, I'm never gonna marry.



I'm never gonna marry if I was gonna marry,

I wouldn't have to be such a stickler.

But I'm never gonna marry,

And a girl who don't marry

Has got to be much more partic'lar



[They Laugh]



Billy

Ah ah ah-

Hey s'ppose- s'ppose I was to say that I would marry you, hmm?



Julie

You!?!



Billy

Oh, that scared you, hmm?

Then you are thinkin' 'bout what the cop said!



Julie

No, I ain't, I never paid no mind of what he said!



Billy

But you wouldn't marry a smear like me, would you?



Julie

Yes, I would!

If I loved you... It wouldn't make no difference what you'd-

Even if I died for it.



Billy

Well, how you know what you'd do if you loved me?

How you'd feel or anythin'?



Julie

I don't know how I know. Just the same I know how it'd be...

If I loved you.

When I work in the mill weaving at the loom

I gaze absent-minded at the roof

And half the time the shuttle get tangled in the threads

And the warp get mixed with the woof

If I loved you...



Billy

But you don't!



Julie

No, I don't!
