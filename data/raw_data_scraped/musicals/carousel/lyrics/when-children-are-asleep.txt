When Children Are Asleep


Enoch

I own a little house and I sail a little boat

And the fish I catch I sell

And in a manner of speakin'

"I'm doin' very well."



I love a little girl and she's in love with me

And soon she'll be my bride.

And in a manner of speakin'

I should be satisfied.



Carrie

Well, ain't you?



Enoch

If I told you my plans and the things I intend

It'll make ev'ry curl on your head stand on it



When I make enough money out of one little boat.

I'll put all of my money in another little boat.

I'll make twice as much outa two little boats,

An' the first thing you know, I'll have four little boats;

And then eight little boats, then a fleet of little boats.

Then a great big fleet of great big boats.

All catchin' herring, bringin' into shore;

Sailin' out again, an' bringin' more.

An' more, an' more, an' more!



Carrie

Who's gonna eat all that herring?



Enoch

[Spoken]

They ain't gonna be herring. I'm gonna put 'em in cans

an' call 'em sardines. Aha... Gonna build a little sardine

cannery. Then a big one, then the biggest one in the whole

country. Oh, Carry, I'm gonna get rich on sardines. Ah!

I mean, we're gonna get rich. You an' me an' all of us...



[Sung]

The first year we're married,

We'll have one little kid.

The second year we're goin'

Have another little kid.

You'll soon be darnin' socks

For eight little feet-



Carrie

I am not enough to another fleet!



Enoch

We'll build a lot more rooms,

Our dear little house will get bigger,

Our dear little house will get bigger-



Carrie

An' so will my figure!



Enoch

[Spoken]

Oh Carrie, can you imagine how it'll be when all the little

kids are upstairs in their beds, and you and me sit alone

by the firelight. Me in my armchair, and you on my knee-



Carrie

Maybe...Maybe...



Enoch

[Sung]

When the children are asleep we sit and dream,

The things that every other dad and mother dream.

When the children are asleep and lights are low,

If I still love you the way I love you today,

You'll pardon my sayin', I told you so...

When the children are asleep, I'll dream with you

We'll think what fun we have had and be glad

That it's all came true



Carrie

When the children are asleep we sit and dream,



Enoch

Dream all alone...



Carrie

The things that every other dad and mother dream



Enoch

Dreams that won't be interrupted...

When the children are asleep and lights are low



Carrie

Hold and behold... If I still love you

The way I love you today,

You'll pardon my sayin', I told you so...

When the children are asleep, I'll dream with you



Enoch

You'll dream with me...



Carrie

We'll think what fun we have had and be glad

That it's all came true!



Enoch

When today is a long time ago...



Both

You'll still hear me say

That the best dream I know is you



Carrie

When the children are asleep I dream with you!
