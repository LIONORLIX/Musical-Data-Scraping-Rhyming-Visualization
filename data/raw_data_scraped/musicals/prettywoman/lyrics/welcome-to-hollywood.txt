Welcome to Hollywood


Tell me, what's your dream? I know you got one

It's like map to your life, you'll be lost until you've caught one

Look at her, she's got dreams of her own deep inside

How do I know? It;s my job, I'm your guy

So stick with me and you'll see where this is going

You'll hear the city's heartbeat in every square of concrete

Come follow me now, welcome to Hollywood



Look at him, he's rich, he thinks he's winning

He needs to learn his journey's just beginning

His childhood hopes all shattered

Now money's all that matters

Yeah, he's lost his way

Welcome to Hollywood



There's danger on the street, it's all around you

But never fear, let hope and fate surround you

Take care of each other, I promise one day

The stars on the sidewalk will show you the way

Don't give up until your dreams have found you



We welcome our arrival

We wish you well

Survival's the name of the game

Welcome to Hollywood



In bright neon light you can party all night here in Hollywood

Things will be fine 'cause the sun's always shining in Hollywood

I live for today, not a care for me

I love it, you love it, we love it

Me and my friends, yeah, the fun never ends here in Hollywood



Hopes and dreams are what this town is made of

So give it a shot, you got nothing to be afraid of

You'll shimmy here and you'll shimmy there

You just might shimmy everywhere

But first, you must believe

Yes, you must believe

If you just believe



You'll see the love we're sending

With every happy ending

This I wil promise

Welcome to Hollywood
