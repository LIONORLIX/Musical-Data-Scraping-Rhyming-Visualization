Anywhere but Here


VIVIAN:

I look around and what I see

Is I don't belong here, this isn't me

What have I become?

I'm really not this girl

Is that all there is

What's it gonna take

To get off the streets?

When do I get a break?

It's not what I wanted

This is not my world



I know where I'd choose to go,

If I could disappear

Anywhere but here

Anywhere but here

I can feel something coming,

I long to be free

I just want to be

Anywhere but here



The sidewalk doesn't suit my soul

I've got to make some changes and take control

I need room to move

I want to feel the wind in my hair

A clear, blue sky with air to breathe

I feel it's time to fly, cause I believe

That there's so much more

And its waiting for me out there



I can see where I want to be

It couldn't be more clear

Anywhere but here

Anywhere but here

I've been waiting for something,

My heart's telling me

I just want to be,

Anywhere but here



No more landlord

No more rent

Just a place of my own

Where I'd be content

I wanna share it all with someone

Who'd share it all with me



I believe somehow, someday

That's the way it will be

Anywhere but here

Anywhere but here

I can feel something coming

I long to be free

I just want to be

Anywhere

Anywhere but here

And I've been waiting for something

My heart's telling me

I just want to be

Anywhere but here
