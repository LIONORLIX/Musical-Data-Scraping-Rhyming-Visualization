Something About Her


EDWARD:

I don't know how I got here

She took me by surprise

She really is quite something

Much more than meets the eye

That was some negotiation

This girl can cut a deal

And I can't help but feel



There's something about her

I can't put my finger on it

There's something about her

I don't know what it is

But I think I want it



A sudden chance encounter

Should I have just refused?

I asked her for directions

Now I feel confused

I can't see where this is going

And I'm not thinking straight

And it's getting late



There's something about her

And I'm seeing it for the first time

There's something about her

I don't know what it is, but now I find



I'm wondering why she feels so free

I'm wondering what's stoppin' me?



There's something about her

That I've never seen before

There's something about her

I don't know what it is

But I know that I need more



VIVIAN: (spoken)

What do you want?



EDWARD: (spoken)

What do you do?



VIVIAN: (spoken)

Everything. But I don't kiss on the mouth



EDWARD: (spoken)

Neither do I
