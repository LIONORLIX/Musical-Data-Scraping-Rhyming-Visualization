Rodeo Drive


Would I ever give you bad advice?

Have I ever steered you wrong?

Oh, maybe I did once or twice

But now we're singin’ a different song



'Cause there ain't no limit on a platinum card

My god, the damage you could do

And he can’t afford, let's hit him hard

Just remember, it's all about you



With this kind of money, honey

We're gonna make his day

So start to make your way to him

Rodeo drive, baby

Yeah, yo



Black dress, white dress

Stay out all night dress

Trust me, you're gonna have some fun

Red shoes, blue shoes

If you make the right moves

He'll want to see you with your button undone



So get what you can, honey

'Cause there ain't nothin’ he won’t do

Come on, they're waitin’ for you, oh

Rodeo drive, baby



I always thought you deserved the best

Can't wait to see you in a classy dress

This is your moment, don't settle for less

You know you can't go wrong

You don’t belong on the boulevard

You're so much more than you think you are

Give Beverly Hills my regards

'Cause that's where you belong

Yeah, where you belong



There ain't much that he ain't got

And girl if I was you

I'd have a blast, I'd go for broke

Hey, what else do you gotta do?

So take what you can, honey

On times you're gonna wanna lie

They're gonna really go hot, hot, hot

Rodeo drive, baby

Rodeo drive, baby

Rodeo drive (rodeo drive)

Rodeo drive
