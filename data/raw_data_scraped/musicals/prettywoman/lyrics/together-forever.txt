Together Forever


EDWARD: (spoken)

Vivian! Princess Vivian

Had to be the top floor, right?



VIVIAN: (spoken)

It's the best!



EDWARD: (spoken)

So, what happened after he climbed up the tower and rescued her?



VIVIAN: (spoken)

She rescues him right back



EDWARD:

I was lost like a ship at sea

No hope, no faith, no plan

You fill my cup and you lift me up

So I can be a better man



VIVIAN:

I was livin' life day by day

Doing anything to survive

You give me strength and confidence

You make me feel alive



VIVIAN & EDWARD:

There was somethin' about you

I knew right from the start



EDWARD, VIVIAN & ENSEMBLE:

Together forever



EDWARD & VIVIAN:

You and me

We're gonna make it somehow



EDWARD, VIVIAN & ENSEMBLE:

Together forever



EDWARD & VIVIAN:

Finally free

And all our tomorrows start now



HAPPY MAN:

Things were movin' at the speed of love

And they followed it to the letter



KIT:

Oh, there ain't nothin' that a man can do

That a woman can't do better



EDWARD & VIVIAN (ENSEMBLE):

I had a feeling inside of me (inside of me)

I'm glad I listened to my heart (listened to my heart), oh yeah



EDWARD, VIVIAN & (ENSEMBLE):

Together forever, you and me

We're gonna make it somehow (make it)

Together forever, we're finally free (finally free)

And all our tomorrows start now, oh yeah

Together forever, you and me

We're gonna make it somehow (make it, make it)

Together forever, we're finally free (finally free)

And all our tomorrows start now



HAPPY MAN: (spoken)

Welcome to Hollywood!

What's your dream?

Everybody's got a dream

Some come true, and some don't

But you'll be lost without one

Come on now, keep on dreaming!



ENSEMBLE:

Your time's arrived, you know it

This town's alive, you own it

Together forever, welcome to Hollywood!
