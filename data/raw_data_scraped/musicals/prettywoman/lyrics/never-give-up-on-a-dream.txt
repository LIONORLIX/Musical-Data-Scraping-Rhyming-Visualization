Never Give Up on a Dream


ENSEMBLE:

Oh



HAPPY MAN: (spoken)

Everybody needs a dream



ENSEMBLE:

Oh



HAPPY MAN:

(spoken) Even a guy like me

(sung)

I always wanted to be a singer

People told me I was a dead ringer

For Marvin Gaye, and one of these days

I'll be singin' at the Hollywood Bowl



Oh wow, one thing led to another

Was your full-time job tryin' to cover

My assets, I had some bad debt

You know the boulevard took its toll



But I've still got some fire in my belly

Stand back, and don't try to tell me

It can't be done, 'cause son of a gun

Never give up, never give up

Never give up on a dream, now



ENSEMBLE:

Oh



KIT:

I had a dream, believe it or not

I wanted to be a cop

Walk the beat, and keep the streets safe

For everyone

Oh, but my dream went left and I went right

Next thing you know, I'm workin' at night

Wearin' six inch heels, instead of a badge and a gun



HAPPY MAN & ENSEMBLE:

Yeah, but you still got some cards on the table

I swear, as long as you're able

To draw a breath, just invest

Never give up on a dream

Gotta keep your eye on the prize

The brass ring that's just your size

No excuse, no alibis

Never give up, never give up

Never give up on a dream



Now, invite the dream, you know what I mean

You gotta seize the opportunity and go to extremes

Find your dance, now, and take your stance, now

And empower the hour of chance, now

So go chase it

Don't you waste it

There's a pie in the sky



KIT:

I can almost taste it



HAPPY MAN & ENSEMBLE:

Never give up on a dream (woo)

Uh, uh

A-he, a-he, a-he

Don't fight the dream, invite the dream

Don't fight the dream, invite the dream

Don't fight the dream, invite the dream

Oh, woah, oh-oh-oh-oh

Oh, woah, oh-oh-oh-oh

Oh, woah, oh-oh-oh-oh

Come on (ahhh)



KIT & ENSEMBLE:

I'm not givin' up (hey)

You're not givin' up

We're never givin' up

Never give up on a dream



Still got some fire in my belly

Stand back, and don't try to tell me

It can't be done, 'cause son of a gun

Never give up on a dream



KIT & HAPPY MAN:

Kick me out in the cold, I'll make it

Squeeze me into a mould, I'll break it

If thereâ€™s a fork in the road, I'll take it

Never give up, never give up, never give up

Never give up on a dream



ENSEMBLE:

Woah



KIT & HAPPY MAN:

Come on



COMPANY:

Never give up on a dream
