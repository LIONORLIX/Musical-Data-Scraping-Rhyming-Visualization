Luckiest Girl in the World


VIVIAN:

My body's shaking, my skin is tingling

All my senses are in overload

I can't believe what just happened to me

I made a deal for 3000 bucks

My head feels like it's gonna explode!

(spoken)

Get here now!

(sung)

Don't want this feelin' to go away

When I think about where I was yesterday

It's so amazing, I can't believe

That a billionaire would care about a girl like me

I've got money to spend, I've got champagne on ice

There's a smile on my face, I'm getting treated real nice

I'm starting to feel like the luckiest girl in the world!



Somebody pinch me, this can't be true

If I deserve this, tell me, what did I do?

He could get a million girls for free

Anyone he wants, but he seems to want me

Look at this, here I am, on the top floor

Everything is first-class, everything is top-drawer

I'm starting to feel like the luckiest girl in the world!



Oh, it's a long, long way from a small town in Georgia

To Beverly Hills, CA

If this keeps on going, I can hardly imagine

What I might see, where I might be

When I walk out that door in six days!



KIT:

Oh my god!

$3000, I can't believe I gave you that guy

Well, you might think that you've got it made

But always stop on makin' sure that you get paid



VIVIAN:

He said two, I said four

We settled on three



VIVIAN & KIT:

And that's a whole lot more!



KIT:

You don't have to remind him

You've got one girl to thank



VIVIAN:

The rent's getting paid



VIVIAN & KIT:

And there's cash in the bank



KIT:

Starting to feel you're the luckiest girl in the world



VIVIAN:

I'm starting to feel like the luckiest girl in the world



VIVIAN & KIT:

We're starting to feel we're the luckiest girls in the world
