Something About Her (Preamble)


EDWARD:

What the hell just happened?

She took me for a ride

She beat me at my own game

She cut me down to size

So now we gotta know her

I'm not sure what to do

Haven't got a clue



There's something about her

She's charming, there's no doubt

There's something about her

I don't know what it is

But I guess that I'll find out



HAPPY MAN:

(spoken)

Maps to the stars

Can't get where you wanna be without a map

It's all written in the stars

(sung)

So come along, I'll meet you there

I can take you anywhere



BARNEY THOMPSON:

Cause anything's possible

(spoken)

Welcome to the Beverly Wilshire Hotel
