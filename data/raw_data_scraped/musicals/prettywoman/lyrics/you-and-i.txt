You and I


EDWARD:

Darling, you look beautiful tonight

I can't remember ever seeing anything so right

In the magic of the moment

There's no place I'd rather be

I see the wonder of the world through your eyes

To have you here beside me makes me realize

Everything is different

Everything has changed inside of me

You and I, we've got something going on

You and I, how could this be wrong?

Who'd believe that we could catch the wind before it's gone?

Only you and I



VIOLETTA:

Sarò là, tra quei fior

Presso a te sempre

Sempre, sempre presso a te!

Amami, Alfredo

Quant'io t'amo!

Addio, Alfredo

Quant'io t'amo!

Quant'io t'amo!

Addio!



EDWARD:

Another way you feel when you're near

If I could be anywhere

I'd want to be right here

It's never met an end

I could spend forever in your arms

Oh, you and I, much to my surprise

You and I, it was right before my eyes

I would give almost anything - the stars, the moon, and the sky

All for you and I



I wasn't waiting for a miracle

I just wanted somewhere to belong

It's amazing what could happen

When you're makin' all good plans

But how was I to know

You were right here all along?



Darling, you look beautiful tonight

I can't remember ever seeing anything so right



EDWARD & VIVIAN:

Like a vision in the darkness

A sight for lonely eyes to see

You and I



EDWARD:

I always want to feel this way



EDWARD & VIVIAN:

You and I



EDWARD:

On any other day

I might have missed the moment,

Now I just want to stay

Together, you and I

Forever, you and I
