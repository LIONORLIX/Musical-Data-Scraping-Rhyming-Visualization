I'll Build a Stairway to Paradise


HENRI BAUREL:

Une chançon,

C'est Paris.

C'est Montmartre.

C'est Robinson.

C'est le jour qui je volerai pendant qu'un oiseau

Car l'amour est là à mon coeur



All you preachers

Who delight in panning the dancing teachers,

Let me tell you there are a lot of features

Of the dance that carry you through

The Gates of Heaven



It's madness

To be always sitting around in sadness,

When you could be learning the Steps of Gladness.

You'll be happy when you can do

Just six or seven.



Begin today. You'll find it nice:

The quickest way to Paradise.

When you practice,

Here's the thing to know,

Simply say as you go:



I'll build a Stairway to Paradise,

With a new Step ev'ry day.

I'm going to get there at any price;

Stand aside, I'm on my way!



I got the blues

And up above it's so fair;

Shoes,

Go on and carry me there!

I'll build a Stairway to Paradise

With a new Step ev'ry day.



I'll build a Stairway to Paradise,

With a new Step ev'ry day.

I'm going to get there at any price;

Stand aside, I'm on my way!



I got the blues

And up above it's so fair;

Shoes,

Go on and carry me there!

I'll build a Stairway to Paradise

With a new Step ev'ry day.

With a new Step ev'ry day.
