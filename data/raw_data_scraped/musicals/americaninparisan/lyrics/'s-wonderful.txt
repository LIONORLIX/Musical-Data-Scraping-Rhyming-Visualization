'S Wonderful


'S wonderful! 'S marvelous!

She should care for me!

'S awful nice! 'S paradise!

'S what I love to see!



She's made my life so glamorous

You can't blame me for feeling amorous

Oh! 'S wonderful! 'S marvelous!

That you should care for me!



'S wonderful! 'S marvelous!

That she should care for me!

'S awful nice! 'S paradise!

'S what I love to see!



She's made my life so glamorous

You can't blame me for feeling amorous

Oh! 'S wonderful! 'S marvelous!

That you should care for me!
