Embraceable You


[INSTRUMENTAL: These lyrics are not in the movie]

Dozens of girls would storm up;

I had to lock my door.

Somehow I couldn't warmp up

To one before.

What was it that controlled me?

What kept my love-life lean?

My intuition told me

You'd come on the scene.

Lady, listen to the rhythm of my heart beat,

and you'll get just what I mean.



Embrace me,

My sweet embraceable you.

Embrace me,

You irreplaceable you.

Just one look at you -- my heart grew tipsy in me;

You and you alone bring out the gipsy in me.

I love all

The many charms about you;

Above all

I want my arms about you.

Don't be a naughty baby,

Come to papa -- come to papa -- do!

My sweet embraceable you.



I went about reciting,

"Here's one who'll never fall!"

But I'm afraid the writing

Is on the wall.

My nose I used to turn up

When you'd besiege my heart;

Now I completely burn up

When you're slow to start.

I'm afraid you'll have to take the consequences;

You upset the apple cart.



Embrace me,

My sweet embraceable you.

Embrace me,

You irreplaceable you.

In your arms I find love so delectable, dear,

I'm afraid it isn't quite respectable, dear.

But hang it --

Come on, let's glorify love!

Ding dang it!

You'll shout "Encore!" if I love.

Don't be a naughty papa,

Come to baby-- come to baby-- do!

My sweet embraceable you.
