No, Not Much


All: I don't want my arms around you,

No, not much.

I don't bless the day I found you,

No, not much.

I don't need you like the stars don't need the sky.

I won't love you longer than the day I die.

You don't please me when you squeeze me,

No, not much.

Jinx: My head's the lightest from your very slightest touch.

All: Baby if you ever go, could I take it? Maybe so.

Ah, but would I like it?

No, not much.

Ahhhhhhhhhhhh. Ah. uh uh.

Ahhhhhhhhhhhh. Ah. uh uh.

Like a 10 cent soda, doesn't cost a dime...

I don't want you near me, only all the time.

You don't thrill me when you hold me,

No, not much.

Jinx: My brain gets hazy from your cool and crazy touch.

All: Baby if you ever go, could I take it? Maybe so.

Ah, but would I like it?

No, not much?

No, not much!!!
