Crazy 'Bout Ya' Baby


Crazy bout you baby want you all to myself

Crazy bout you baby no one else on the shelf

Give me all your lovin all that you can afford

Let me keep you always have a cupid doll



Crazy bout you baby, crazy bout you baby

Crazy bout you baby want you all to myself

Crazy bout you baby, crazy bout you baby

Crazy bout you baby want you all to myself



Now the time has come honey

won't you please be my wife

I will take good care of you

the rest of your life

I'm gonna spend a lot of money

House built for two

A cottage in the country

For just me and you



Crazy bout you baby, crazy bout you baby

Crazy bout you baby want you all to myself



Crazy bout you baby,

Man I'm crazy bout you

Crazy bout you baby,

Don't know what I'm gonna do

Crazy bout you baby

I'm just bubbling with joy

Crazy bout you baby

want you all to myself

Crazy, crazy

Crazy bout you baby

want you all to myself



After we are married

We will raise a family

All the plans we had before

Will fit to a tee

When we live in humble

In our own little way

If we're to be so fortunate

Could this be the day



Crazy bout you baby, crazy bout you baby

Crazy bout you baby want you all to myself

Crazy, yes I'm crazy

Crazy baby, want you all to myself
