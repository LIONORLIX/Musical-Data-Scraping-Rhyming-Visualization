Heart and Soul


(spoken): Okay... Let's see.

Yes!



(sung):Heart and soul, I fell in love with you

Lost control, just like a fool would do,

gladly

Because you held me tight

And stole a kiss in the night



Heart and soul, I begged to be adored

Lost control, and tumbled overboard,

gladly

That magic night we kissed

There in the moon mist



Oh! but your lips were thrilling, much too thrilling

Never before were mine so strangely willing



But now I see, what one embrace can do

Look at me, you've got me loving you

madly

That little kiss you stole

Held all my heart and soul



gladly

Because you held me tight

And stole a kiss in the night



gladly

That magic night we kissed

There in the moon mist



Oh! but your lips were thrilling, much too thrilling

Never before were mine so strangely willing



But now I see, what one embrace can do

Look at me, you've got me loving you

madly

That little kiss you stole

Held all my heart and

Madly

that little kiss you stole

Held all my heart and soul



(spoken): Sparky?
