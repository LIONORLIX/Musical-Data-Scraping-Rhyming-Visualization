I Can Cook Too


HILDY:

Oh, I can cook, too, on top of the rest,

My seafood's the best in the town.

And I can cook, too.

My fish can't be beat,

My sugar's the sweetest around.

I'm a man's ideal of a perfect meal

Right down to the demi-tasse.

I'm a pot of joy for a hungry boy,

Baby, I'm cookin' with gas.

Oh, I'm a gumdrop,

A sweet lollipop,

A brook trout right out of the brook,

And what's more, baby, I can cook!



Some girls make magazine covers,

Some girls keep house on a dime,

Some girls make wonderful lovers,

But what a lucky find I'm.

I'd make a magazine cover,

I do keep house on a dime,

I make a wonderful lover,

I should be paid overtime!



'Cause I can bake, too, on top of the lot,

My oven's the hottest you'll find.

Yes, I can roast too,

My chickens just ooze,

My gravy will lose you your mind.

I'm a brand new note

On a table d'h?te,

But just try me ? la carte.

With a single course

You can choke a horse.

Baby, you won't know where to start!

Oh, I'm an hors d'oeuvre,

A jelly preserve,

Not in the recipe book,

And what's more, baby, I can cook!



Baby, I'm cookin' with gas.

Oh, I'm a gumdrop,

A sweet lollipop,

A brook trout right out of the brook,

And what's more, baby, I can cook!



Some girls make wonderful jivers,

Some girls can hit a high "C",

Some girls make good taxi drivers,

But what a genius is me.

I'd make a wonderful jiver,

I even hit a high "C",

I make the best taxi driver,

I rate a big Navy "E"!



'Cause I can fry, too, on top of the heap,

My Crisco's as deep as a pool.

Yes, I can broil, too,

My ribs get applause,

My lamb chops will cause you to drool.

For a candied sweet

Or a pickled beet,

Step up to my smorgasbord.

Walk around until

You get your fill.

Baby, you won't ever be bored!

Oh, I'm a pat?,

A marron glac?,

A dish you will wish you had took.

And what's more, baby, I can cook!!
