New York! New York!


OZZIE:

Come on, Gabey, hurry up!



CHIP:

Twenty-four hours!



SAILOR:

Hey, why don't ya look where you're goin'.

You'd think it was your first time in New York!



GABEY:

It is!



(The sailors look around them, happily absorbing the scene.)



GABEY, CHIP, OZZIE:

New York, New York!

It's a helluva town!



GABEY:

We've got one day here and not another minute

To see the famous sights!



OZZIE:

We'll find the romance and danger waiting in it

Beneath the Broadway lights;

But we've hair on our chests

So what we like the best are the nights

Sights! Lights! Nights!



GABEY, CHIP, OZZIE:

New York, New York, a helluva town.

The Bronx is up, but the Battery's down.

The people ride in a hole in the groun'.

New York, New York, it's a helluva town!



CHIP:

(points to Empire State Building)

Hey, Gabey! Gabey, look.



(consulting his guidebook with reverence and excitement)



Gabey, it says here "There are 20,000 streets in New York,

not counting MacDougal Alley the heart of Green-Witch Village,

a charming thoroughfare filled with..."



OZZIE:

Here we go again!



CHIP:

The famous places to visit are so many,

Or so the guidebooks say.

I promised Daddy I wouldn't miss on any.

And we have just one day.

Got to see the whole town

From Yonkers on down to the Bay.



GABEY, CHIP, OZZIE:

In just one day!



New York, New York, a visitor's place,

Where no one lives on account of the pace,

But seven millions are screaming for space.

New York, New York, it's a visitor's place!



(Two sailors enter, weaving and weary-looking -

one happy, one very glum.)



GABEY:

Hey! Look who's comin' back! It's Tom and Andy!



OZZIE:

Hey, Tom, Andy! Hey, fellas, how are the New York dames?



ANDY:

Wonderful - I don't remember a thing!



TOM:

Awful! I remember everything!



(Tom and Andy exit.)



OZZIE:



Manhattan women are dressed in silk and satin,

Or so the fellas say;

There's just one thing that's important in Manhattan,

When you have just one day;

Gotta pick up a date...



CHIP:

Maybe seven...



OZZIE:

Or eight

On your way.



GABEY, CHIP, OZZIE:

In just one day!



New York, New York, a helluva town.

The Bronx is up, but the Battery's down.

The people ride in a hole in the groun'.

New York, New York, it's a helluva town!!
