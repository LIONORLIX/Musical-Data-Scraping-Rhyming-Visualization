Come Up To My Place


CHIP:

My father told me, "Chip, my boy,

There'll come a time when you leave home;

If you should ever hit New York,

Be sure to see the Hippodrome."



HILDY:

The Hippodrome?



CHIP:

The Hippodrome.



HILDY:

Did I hear right?

Did you say the Hippodrome?



CHIP:

Yes, you heard right.

Yes, I said the Hip-



(Hildy brakes.)



Hey what did you stop for?



HILDY:

It ain't there anymore.

Aida sang an "A"

And blew the place away!



CHIP:

Aw, I wanted to see the Hippodrome!



HILDY:

Give me a chance, kid;

I may not have 5,000 seats but the one I have is a honey!

Come up to my place.



CHIP:

Oh no, lady; the Forrest The-a-tre.



When I was home I saw the plays

The Ladies Drama Circle showed.

Now I am here, I want to get

Some tickets for "Tobacco Road."



HILDY:

"Tobacco Road?"



CHIP:

"Tobacco Road?"



HILDY:

Did I dig that?

Did you say "Tobacco Road"?



CHIP:

Yes, you dug that,

Yes, I said "Tobac-"



(Hildy brakes again.)



Hey what for did you stop?



HILDY:

That show has closed up shop.

The actors washed their feet

And called it "Angel Street."



CHIP:

Aw, I wanted to see "Tobacco Road."



HILDY:

Stick with me, kid, and I'll show you the road to ruin.

Come up to my place.



CHIP:

Oh no, Battery Park.



Back home I dreamt of catching fish

So big I couldn't carry 'em.

They told me that they have my size

Right here in the Aquarium.



HILDY:

Aquarium?



CHIP:

Aquarium.



HILDY:

Hold the phone, Joe?

Did you say Aquarium?



CHIP:

I'm still ringing;

But I said Aquar-



(She brakes again.)



Did you stop for what, hey?



HILDY:

The fish have flown away;

They're in the Bronx instead,

They might as well be dead!

Come up to my place.



CHIP:

No, Chambers Street.



They told me I could see New York

In all its spreading strength and power

From the city's highest spot,

Atop the famous Woolworth Tower.



HILDY:

The Woolworth Tower?



CHIP:

The Woolworth Tower.



HILDY:

Beat me, Daddy,

Did you say the Woolworth Tower?



CHIP:

I won't beat you,

But I said the Wool-



(Hildy brakes again.)



Did you stop for hey what?



HILDY:

That ain't the highest spot.

You're just a little late,

We got the Empire State!

Let's go to my place!



CHIP:

Let's go to Cleopatra's Needle.

Let's see Wanamaker's Store.

Let's go to Lindy's, go to Luchow's;

Let's see Radio City and Herald Square.

Go to Reuben's! Go to Macy's!

To the Roxy! Cloisters! Gimbel's!

Flatiron Building! Hippodrome!!



HILDY:

My place!!!
