Some Other Time


CLAIRE:

Twenty-four hours can go so fast,

You look around, the day has passed.

When you're in love,

Time is precious stuff;

Even a lifetime isn't enough.



Where has the time all gone to?

Haven't done half the things we want to.

Oh, well, we'll catch up

Some other time



This day was just a token,

Too many words are still unspoken.

Oh, well, we'll catch up

Some other time.



Just when the fun is starting,

Comes the time for parting,

But let's be glad for what we've had

And what's to come.

There's so much more embracing

Still to be done, but time is racing.

Oh, well, we'll catch up

Some other time.



HILDY:

Didn't get half my wishes,

Never have seen you dry the dishes.

Oh, well, we'll catch up

Some other time.

Can't satisfy my craving,

Never have watched you while you're shaving.

Oh, well, we'll catch up

Some other time.



CLAIRE, HILDY, CHIP, OZZIE:

Just when the fun's beginning,

Comes the final-inning...



OZZIE:

Haven't had time to wake up,

Seeing you there without your make-up.

Oh, well, we'll catch up

Some other time.



ALL:

Just when the fun is starting,

Comes the time for parting,

But let's be glad for what we've had

And what's to come.

There's so much more embracing

Still to be done, but time is racing.

Oh, well, we'll catch up

Some other time.
