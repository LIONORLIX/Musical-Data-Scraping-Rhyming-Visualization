So Long Baby


GIRLS:

So long, I'm on the loose again.

So long, I counted up to ten.

Bye, bye, baby - I got wise.

Too long you made a fool of me,

Too long you had me up a tree,

Now you get the booby prize.



So you cry - Boo hoo hoo,

And you feel oh so blue.

It's no use, now that I'm leaving you.

You need a new pal, papa.

So long, I've stood it long enough.

So long, my turn to call your bluff.

So long, baby, I've got wise to you.
