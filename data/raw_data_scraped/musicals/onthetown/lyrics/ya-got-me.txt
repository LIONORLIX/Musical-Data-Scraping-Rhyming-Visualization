Ya Got Me


HILDY:

I'm eager to share my love and devotion,

It's deep as the ocean.

I've plenty to spare, and since it's so ample,

I'll throw you a sample.

I will fix you up on the spot,

So forget the things you have not.

Can't you see, kid, what a very rare treasure you got?



Ya got me, baby, ya got me!

Ya got my affection, baby, and my sympathy.

Ya got my whole muscular equipment from A to Z,

And it's free, baby, it's all free.



ALL:

It's all free.



OZZIE:

Ya got me, Gabey, ya got me!

Ya got my enthusiasm on the land and sea.

Ya got my whole knack of gettin' ladies,

It can't be beat.

And it's free, Gabey, it's all free.



ALL:

It's all free, it's all free, it's all free.



CLAIRE:

I'm filled to the brim with eager affection

That seeks a direction.

My vigor and vim leave no one excluded,

And you are included.

I will get you out of your lull,

You won't feel unwanted or dull,

If you'll get this through that normal Neanderthal skull:



Ya got me, baby, ya got me!

Ya got my extensive knowledge of anatomy.



OTHERS:

...of anatomy!



CLAIRE:

Ya got my whole interest in mankind - of every breed...

And it's free, baby, it's all free.



ALL:

It's all free, it's all free, it's all free.



CHIP:

Ya got me, Gabey, ya got me!

Ya got a guy who always functions systematically.



OTHERS:

...-matically.



CHIP:

Ya got my whole family in Peoria, for you to see!

And it's free, Gabey, it's all free.



ALL:

It's all free, it's all free, it's all free.



HILDY & CLAIRE:

Ya got we, Gabey, ya got we!



OZZIE & CHIP:

Ya got a date with Lucy Schmeeler, girl of mystery.



CLAIRE & HILDY:

Mystery.



ALL:

Ya got her whole reservoir of passion

To fill your need,

And it's free, Gabey,

Without fee, Gabey,

Can't you see, Gabey?

It's all free!



CLAIRE & HILDY:

Ya got he!



OZZIE & CHIP:

Ya got she!



ALL:

Ya got we!!
