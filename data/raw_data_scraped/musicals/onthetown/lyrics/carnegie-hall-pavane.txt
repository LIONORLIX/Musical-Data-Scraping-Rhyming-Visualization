IVY:

Do-do-re-do.



DILLY:

Do-re-mi-do.

Mustn't be discouraged if the going is slow.



IVY:

Do-do-re-do.



DILLY:

Love life must go,

If you'd be a nightingale instead of a crow.

Sing high and low.



IVY:

Do-ti-la-do.



DILLY:

Any voice grow



If you'll sing your do-re-do.



IVY:

Onwards!



DILLY:

Do-do-re-do.



IVY:

Onwards! Upwards!



DILLY:

Sex has to go.



BOTH:

Sing high and low,

Do-ti-la-do



And you soon will know

Anyone can go

From the lowest low

To the very highest high

If they will only sing their

Do-do-re-do.

Do-re-mi-do.



CHORUS:

Onwards!

Do-do-re-do.

Onwards! Upwards!

Sex has to go.

Do-re-do,

Upwards and on.



Do-do-re-do.

Your little voice will grow

And you'll be a nightingale

Instead of a crow.

Do-do-re-do.

Don't be discouraged, babe,

If the going is slow.



Do-do-do-do-re-mi-do.

Sex is out.

Sing it high and low.

You will be a nightingale

If you will sing your

Do-do-re-do.

Do-re-mi-do.



ALL:

Sing high and low.

Do-ti-la-do.

Anyone can grow

If you sing your do-re-do.
