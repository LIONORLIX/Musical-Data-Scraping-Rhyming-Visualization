Carried Away


CLAIRE:

Modern man, what is it?

Just a collection of complexes

and neurotic impulses

that occasionally break through



OZZIE:

You mean sometimes you blow your top, like me?



CLAIRE:

I do.



I try hard to stay controlled

But I get carried away,

Try to act aloof and cold,

But I get carried away.



OZZIE & CLAIRE:

Carried away, carried away,

You/I get carried, just carried away!



CLAIRE:

When I sit and listen to a symphony

Why can't I just say the music's grand?

Why must I leap upon the stage hysterically?

They're playing pizzicato,

And everything goes blotto,

I grab the maestro's stick and start in leading the band!



OZZIE & CLAIRE:

Carried away, carried away,

You/I get carried, just carried away!



OZZIE:

And when I go to see a moving picture show,

And I'm watching actors in a scene,

I start to think what's happening is really so.

The girl, I must protect her.

The villain don't respect her.

I leap to her defense and knock a hole right through the screen!



CLAIRE & OZZIE:

Carried away, carried away,

You/I get carried, just carried away!



OZZIE:

I try hard to keep detached,

But I get carried away.

Try to act less booby-hatched,

But I get carried away.



CLAIRE & OZZIE:

Carried away, carried away,

You/I get carried, just carried away!



OZZIE:

When shopping I'm a sucker for a bargain sale.

If something is marked down upon a shelf,

My sense of what is practical begins to fail;

I buy one, then another,

Another, then another,

I buy the whole store out and I'm in business for myself!



CLAIRE & OZZIE:

Carried away, carried away,

You/I get carried, just carried away!



CLAIRE:

And when I go to see my friends off on a train,

Golly, how I hate to see them go.

For then my love of travelling I can't restrain.

The time has come for parting,

The train's already starting,

I hop a freight and in a flash I'm off to Buffalo!

We get carried, just carried a - way!



OZZIE:

Carried away, carried away,

We get carried, just carried a - way!
