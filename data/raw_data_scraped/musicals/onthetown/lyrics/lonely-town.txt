Lonely Town


GABEY:

Gabey's comin', Gabey's comin' to town.

So what? Who cares?

Back on the ship it seemed such a snap;

You'd tap a girl on the shoulder,

She'd turn around,

And she'd say: "I love you."

But once on shore, it's not such a snap;

You get the cold shoulder,

The old run-around,

You're left with no one but you.

Gabey's comin', Gabey's comin' to town.



A town's a lonely town,

When you pass through

And there is no one waiting there for you,

Then it's a lonely town.

You wander up and down,

The crowds rush by,

A million faces pass before your eye,

Still it's a lonely town.



Unless there's love,

A love that's shining like a harbor light,

You're lost in the night;

Unless there's love,

The world's an empty place

And every town's a lonely town.
