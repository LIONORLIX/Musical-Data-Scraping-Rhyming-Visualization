Twice in Love Every Day


ROSE

I've been in love with 'em all

Every man in this dir'y ol' city

There's many a bloke I recall

Who's added some love to my kitty



ALL

Keep your virtues



ROSE

I don't have time



ALL

Keep your lovers



ROSE

I'm changin' mine



Ive got so much lovin' that I'm



ALL

Twice in love every day

And I like it that way

Twice in love every day



ROSE

Ladies don't face me and sneer

And think of your husbands affection

With the husband you're holdin' so near

I've probably had a connection



ALL

Keep your morals



ROSE

I don't have time



ALL

Keep your lovers



ROSE

I'm changin' mine



I've hung every fruit on my vine



ALL

Twice in love every day

And I like it that way

Twice in love every day



ROSE

Don't knock us poor lovers of love

Our service is breif but so tender

We get your poor fellas because

You forget the tricks we remember (oh yeah!)



ALL

Keep your epics



ROSE

I don't have time



ALL

Keep your lovers



ROSE

I'm changin' mine



ALL

Come all husbands

Get in a line

Twice in love every day

And I like it that way

Twice in love every day



Keep your efforts



ROSE

I don't have time



ALL

Keep your lovers



ROSE

I'm changin' mine



ALL

I've got so much lovin' that I'm

Twice in love every day

And I like it that way

Twice in love every day
