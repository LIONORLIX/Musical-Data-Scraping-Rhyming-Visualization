Love is Here


(Johnny)

I aint got no gifts to bring

this aint paris it aint spring

No pearls for you to wear



(Jenny)

I would'nt mind a bit of that



(Johnny)

I don't have no shinning moon

we're bloody miles from june

but you know love is here.



All them poets with their rhyme

their pretty words in time

are missing whats so clear



(Jenny)

It dos'nt mean a thing to me



(Johnny)

Painters they have missed it to

writters havent got a clue

they cant see love is here



I could look forever

and i know id never

find a better way to say

things i feel so plainly

and what matters mainly is

i got you here today



You wont get sweet words from me

no pretty poetry

to whisper is your ear

kings and queens are just like me

but they got finery

my darlin love is here



(Dance Break)



(Johnny)

I could look forever

and i know id never

find a better way to say

things i feel so plainly

and what matters mainly is

i got you here today



(Jenny)

You wont get sweet words from me

no pretty poetry

to whisper is your ear

kings and queens are just like me

but they got finery

my darlin love is here



(Both)

I could look forever

and i know id never

find a better way to say

things i feel so plainly

and what matters mainly is

i got you here today



You wont get sweet words from me

no pretty poetry

to whisper is your ear

kings and queens are just like me

but they got finery

my darlin love is here



(Jenny)

But you know love is here



(Johnny)

Yes you know love is here



(Both)

Yes you know love is here
