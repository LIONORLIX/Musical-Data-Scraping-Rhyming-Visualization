Eat Excrete


[SHAWNTEL, CHUCKY, ANDREA, TREMONT AND DWIGHT]

We eat, excrete and watch TV,

And you are there for us, Jerry.

Jerry, can you understand?

We sit out in nowhere land,

Wanting and yearning,

Our bloated stomachs churning,

Eat, excrete and watch TV.



[ANDREA]

But you are there for us, Jerry.



[JERRY (spoken)]

Steve, let me get this straight... you eat, excrete...?



[SHAWNTEL, CHUCKY, ANDREA, TREMONT AND DWIGHT]

...and watch TV.



[JERRY (spoken)]

But I am there for you?



[SHAWNTEL, CHUCKY, ANDREA, TREMONT AND DWIGHT]

Jerry.



[JERRY (spoken)]

Steve, what are they saying exactly?



[GLOOMY NURSES]

Jerry, it's not difficult,

They're exactly saying that,

They eat excrete and watch TV,

You you are there for them, Jerry.



[JERRY (spoken)]

That's nice. I really appreciate you guys taking the time out of your day to come by.

I never knew I had so many friends. So how's it going with you guys?



[SHAWNTEL, CHUCKY, ANDREA, TREMONT AND DWIGHT]

To be frank,

Pretty fucked.



[JERRY (spoken)]

Hey, I can sympathise. Ratings are low, I've got a class action suit pending,

not to mention this bullet wound in the chest thing.



[WHOLE ENSEMBLE]

Come and see.

Come and see what you have done to me.



[JERRY (spoken)]

Steve, this sounds like lawyer talk. Don't say anything.
