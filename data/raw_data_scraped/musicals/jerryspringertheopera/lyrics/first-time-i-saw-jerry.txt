First Time I Saw Jerry


[WARM UP MAN]

The first time I saw Jerry on TV,

I knew that their was hope for me,

When I saw how he worked the crowd,

I knew that he could help me out,

Before that, I was empty inside,

I had considered suicide,

But now, I'm a vital member of Jerry's team.

But sometimes, I wonder how much he values me.
