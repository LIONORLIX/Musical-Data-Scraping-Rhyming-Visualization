[JERRY (spoken)]

Shawntel, it says here you want to be a poledancer?



[SHAWNTEL]

All my life, all my life,

I've been running after other people,

Looking after them, cleaning up their shit,

Now I wanna find my dreams again.



[JERRY (spoken)]

What in a stip club?



[MAN (spoken)]

Good one!



[ENSEMBLE]

Bug-eyed loser! Strip slut!

Bug-eyed loser! Strip slut!



[SHAWNTEL]

Talk to the ass!



[ENSEMBLE]

Strip slut!



[SHAWNTEL]

Talk to the ass!



[ENSEMBLE]

Strip slut!



[JERRY (spoken)]

Shawntel, I can see you have a lot of natural talent.

I also see that you're married. What does your husband think?



[SHAWNTEL]

I dunno, we don't talk...



[JERRY (spoken)]

Well, let's bring him on and find out. Please welcome Chucky!



[ENSEMBLE]

Hillbilly, hillbilly,

Squeal like a piggy!

Hillbilly, hillbilly,

Squeal like a piggy!

Eeee!



[CHUCKY]

Put your fucking clothes on,

You stupid bitch...



[SHAWNTEL]

Don't you touch me,

Or I'll kill you in your sleep,

Cocksucker!

Talk to the ass!



[CHUCKY]

You look ridiculous!



[SHAWNTEL]

Talk to the ass!



[CHUCKY]

You look ridiculous!



[JERRY (spoken)]

So, Chucky, I take it you're not too thrilled with Shawntel's poledancing dreams.



[CHUCKY]

She looks like a clown,

She looks like a slut.



[SHAWNTEL]

He don't know shit,

He never saw me dance,

But he watches other women dance every night,

With his buddies.



[JERRY (spoken)]

Well, let's see her dance! We have a pole, we have some music. Shawntel, let's go!
