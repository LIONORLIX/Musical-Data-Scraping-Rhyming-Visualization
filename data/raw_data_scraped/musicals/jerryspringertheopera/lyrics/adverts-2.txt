Buy a gun, buy a big gun!

Have some fun with a big gun!

Ooh, look at my gun,

Look at my big gun!

Ooh, look at my gun!

Look at my big gun!

You could have a gun too,

Yes, you could have a gun too,

But you've gotta buy it first!

Give into Jesus,

Or alternitively die!

Die a ho-o-o-o-o-o-orible,

Die a horrible death!

Jesus.
