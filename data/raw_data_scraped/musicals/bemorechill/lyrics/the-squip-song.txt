The Squip Song




[Rich]

Freshman year

Didn't have a girlfriend or a clue

I was a loser just like you

Good times would only

Soar by



I was gross

As every female would attest

My sexting was a futile quest

My little penis was depressed

He was so lonely

Poor guy



I was hopeless, hopeless

I was helpless, helpless

Every time I walked the hallway I would trip

I was stagnant and idle

I was so suicidal and then, then, then

Then, then, then, then, then

Then, then, then, then,

Then I got a Squip



[Jeremy]

You got quick?



[Rich]

Not quick. Squip.



[Jeremy]

I've just never heard of it before.



[Rich]

That's the point. This is some top-secret-can't-even-look-it-up-on-the-internet shit.



[Rich]

It's from Japan

It's a grey, oblong pill

Quantum nanotechnology CPU

The quantum computer in the pill

Will travel through your blood until

It implants in your brain and tells you what to do



[Jeremy]

So... It's like drugs?



[Rich]

It's better than drugs, Jeremy.



It's from Japan

It's a grey, oblong pill

Quantum nanotechnology CPU

The quantum computer in the pill

Will travel through your blood until

It implants in your brain and tells you what to do

It tells you what to do



It's pre-programmed

It's amazing

Speaks to you directly



You behave as

It's appraising

Helps you act correctly



Helps you to be cool

Helps you rule



Picture this

Nobody cares if you are late

'Cause even teachers think you're great

Your weekend's just a full-on slate

Of blowout benders

Of teenage rockstar splendors



Right now you're helpless, helpless

You are almost hopeless

On the school social map you're just a blip

But if you take my advice and if you

Pay the listed price, well then you

Go from sad, to interesting, to hip

Yeah, your whole life will flip

When you buy a squip



Hey, yeah, a squip

Yeah, yeah, a squip

A-ah a squip



No longer a drip when you've got in your grip

A squip

A squip

A squip
