A Guy That Iâ€™d Kinda Be Into




Say there's this person you pass in the hall everyday

You've known him since 7th grade

You're used to thinking about him in a certain way

From the persona that he displays

And then something changes

And he changes



From a guy that you'd never be into

Into a guy that you'd kinda be into

From a guy that I'd never be into

Into a guy that I'd kinda be into



Is he worth it?

Jeremy?

Is he?



JEREMY

Is she talking about me?



SQUIP

Of course she is!

I've been activating your pheromones

Keep it up



CHRISTINE

Say there's this person that you never knew that well



COMPANY

She is totally into you!



CHRISTINE

You thought that you had him pegged

But now you can tell he's gone



From a guy that you'd never be into

Into a guy that you'd kinda be into

From a guy that I'd never be into

Into a guy that I'd kinda be into



Is he worth it?

Jeremy?



COMPANY

Absolutely



CHRISTINE

I don't always relate to other people my age

Except when I'm on the stage

There are so many changes that I'm going through

And why am I telling this to you?



Guess there's a part of me that wants to

I guess a part of me wants to

Who knew?

I guess a part of me likes to talk to you

I guess a part of me likes to

Who knew?



I guess a part of me likes to sit with you

I guess a part of me likes to

Who knew?

I guess a part of me likes to hang with you

I guess a part of me...



Back to play rehearsal

I know that it's weird

But it's totally true



A guy that I'd kinda be into



JEREMY

The guy that you'd kind of be into



CHRISTINE

Yeah



BOTH

That guy that you'd/I'd kinda be into



CHRISTINE

Is... Jake
