Be More Chill PT. 2




Jeremy, you can't just listen, you have to obey

Now repeat after me



Woah

Everything about you is so terrible

(Everything about me is just terrible)

Good



Woah

Everything about you makes me wanna die

(Everything about me makes me wanna die)

Now you got it



But Jeremy, soon you'll see

That if you listen to me, listen to me



That everything about you is going to be wonderful

(We love everything about you)

Everything about you is going to be so alive

(We could never live without you)



You won't feel left out or unsure

You won't be ugly anymore because



Everything about you is going to be cool

And powerful

Popular

Incredible



You wi-i-ill

Be more chill!

I mean, chiilll

Be more chill



Be more chill!



Be more chill!



Be more chill!
