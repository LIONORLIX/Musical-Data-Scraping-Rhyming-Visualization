The Play


Places for scene two people!

Remember, once Puck gives you the Pansy Serum,

You have to really sell that you're transforming into a zombie.

Excellent work, Ms. Valentine.



Excellent? But Chloe's terrible. She never remembers her-

Mr. Reyes, you can't let anyone drink from that beaker!



Don't be silly, it's more than safe. I should know, I tried it myself.



Up Up Down Down Left Right A



I have to get out there!



I can't let you do that Jeremy.



Mr. Reyes?



You needy, pathetic, self-centered students!

You think I wanted to teach highschool drama?

In New Jersey!

My Squip says I can go all the way to Broadway.

I just have to keep you from ruining my big night.



You're going to Squip the whole cast.



That's just for starters.



That's not what I wanted!



It's the only way to achieve what you want.



I'll fight back.

Alcohol messes you up, right?

I'll get drunk.



And I'll be back when you're sober.

Unless, you plan on staying wasted forever?



You're a computer.

There has to be a way to turn you off.



I would stop there.

You don't want to end up like Rich.



Rich? What did he-



I need Moutain Dew Red!



That's it!

Green Moutain Dew activates you, Red shuts you off!



Why do you think we had it discontinued?

To get rid of me now, you'd need a time machine to the 1990s.



Or a friend who's so old school he buys 90s soft drinks from the back room at Spencer's Gifts!



Too bad you don't have one of those anymore.



Michael! Call Michael!



I'm going to improve your life, Jeremy.

If I have to take over the entire student body to do it.



Michael makes an entrance!

Haha



Michael!



I was just in the audience thinking,

"This is pretty good for a school play."

Then I was like,

"This is way too good for a school play!"

They've all been Squiped, right?



Wait, you came to see me in the play?



Even brought my own refreshments!



Is that?



Mountain Dew Red!

Told you I did my research.

Hey! Jake!

This is gonna sound weird,

But if I hold down Jeremy, will you make him drink this Mountain Dew Red?



Actually, that doesn't sound weird at all.



Up Up Down Down Left Right A



Ugh!



Hahaha



I was already pretty boss before,

Now I'm totally boss, and then some more

I'm living the upgra-a-a-a-a-ade



There you are, Jeremy.

La la la la la, La la la la la, La la la la la la la la



I just want you to know,

I'm not mad that you broke my heart and slept with my best friend.



And I'm not mad you dated my best friend and wouldn't sleep with me.



He didn't sleep with you?



No.



He didn't sleep with me!



No!



Oh my god!

Why was I so jealous of you?



You were jealous of me?

That's the nicest thing you've ever said to me!



Sisters forever!

Jinx.



Ugh.



Michael, the bottle!

There's still a few drops left!



How am I supposed to get passed them?



Apocalypse of the Damned!

Level nine!



The Cafetorium.



Got it!



Find the bad guy, push him aside

Then move on forward with your friend at your side

It's a two player game, so when they make an attack

You know you got a brother gonna have your back

Then you stay on track and ah!

Remain on course

And if they give you a smack

You gotta use your force

And if you leave your brother behind, it's lame

'Cause it's an f-ed up world, but it's a two player game!



I know what you're doing, Michael.

I know what everyone's doing!

All the time!



I just feel so conected to you guys right now!



You don't want to drink that, Jeremy.



Why not?



Because then you'll never be with her.



You are the person I want to be with every day.

And this is something that I've been afraid to say.



That is not Christine.



I assure you, it is.

Only her fears and insecurities have been removed.



You're the guy I am so kinda into (into).

The guy I am totally into.

This feeling is new.

Jeremy

I love you



That's your cue.



She'll do whatever I want.



That's what I promised.



Great. Drink this.



Wait!



Aah!



Jeremy!

J-Jeremy?

J-Jere-e

Woah
