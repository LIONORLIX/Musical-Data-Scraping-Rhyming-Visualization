Michael in the Bathroom


I am hanging in the bathroom

At the biggest party of the fall

I could stay right here or disappear

And nobody'd even notice at all



I'm a creeper in a bathroom

'Cause my buddy kinda left me alone

But I'd rather fake pee than stand awkwardly

Or pretend to check a text on my phone



Everything felt fine

When I was half of a pair

For no fault of mine

There's no other half there



Now I'm just

Michael in the bathroom

Michael in the bathroom at a party

Forget how long it's been

I'm just

Michael in the bathroom

Michael in the bathroom at a party

No you can't come in

I'm waiting it out 'til it's time to leave

And picking at grout as I softly grieve

I'm just Michael who you don't know

Michael flying solo

Michael in the bathroom by himself

All by himself



I am hiding but he's out there

Just ignoring all our history

Memories get erased

And I'll get replaced

With a newer cooler version of me



And I hear a drunk girl

Sing along to Whitney through the door

"I wanna dance with somebody"

And my feelings sink

'Cause it makes me think

Now there's no one to make fun of drunk girls with anymore



Now it's just

Michael in the bathroom

Michael in the bathroom at a party

I half regret the beers

Michael in the bathroom

Michael in the bathroom at a party

As I choke back the tears

I'll wait as long as I need 'til my face is dry

Or I'll just blame it on weed

Or something in my eye

I'm just Michael who you don't know

Michael flying solo

Michael in the bathroom by himself



Knock knock knock knock

They're gonna start to shout soon

Knock knock knock knock

Oh hell yeah I'll be out soon

Knock knock knock knock

It sucks he left me here alone

Knock knock knock knock

Here in this teenage battlezone

Clang clang clang clang

I feel the pressure blowing up

Bang bang bang bang

My big mistake was showing up

Splash splash splash splash

I throw some water in my face

And I am in a better place

I go to open up the door

But I can't hear knocking anymore



And I can't help but yearn

For a different time

And then I look in the mirror

And the present is clearer

And there's no denying

I'm just



At a party

Is there a sadder sight than

Hmhmm hm hm hmhmmm

Michael in the bathroom at a party

This is a heinous night



I wish I stayed at home in bed watching cable porn

Or I'd offed myself instead

Wish I was never born

I'm just Michael who's a loner

So he must be a stoner

Rides a PT cruiser

God he's such a loser

Michael flying solo

Who you think that you know

Michael in the bathroom by himself

All by himself

All by himself



All you know about me is my name



Awesome party

I'm so glad I came
