Two-Player Game


Michael (Spoken):

Apocalypse of the damned!

Jeremy:

Level 9!

Both:

The cafitorium!

(Sung)

Find the bad guy, push 'em aside.

Then move on forward with your friend at your side.

It's a two-player game, so when they make an attack,

You know you got a brother gonna have your back.

Then you stay on track, and I remain on course.

If they give you a smack, you gotta use your force.

And if you leave your brother behind, it's lame!

Cause it's an effed up world, and it's a two-player game, hey!

Michael:

Dude you are cooler than a vintage cassette.

It's just that no one else but me thinks that yet.

You're just a nothing in this high school scheme,

But it's no big cause you and I are a team.

We like out of print games, retro skates, got a Pac-Man tattoo.

Nobody here appreciates, but soon we'll be together where they do.

Cause guys like us are cool in college, cool in college, yes I know.

Guys like us are cool in college, rule in college, listen, bro.

High school is hell, but we navigate it well.

Cause what we do, is we make it a two player game!

Both (spoken):

Zombie!

Watch out!

Ah!

Wha-!?

Aww..

Jeremy (sung):

As users we have fought together for years.

Both Nintendo zombies and our popular peers!

Now we're stuck on a level and I wanna move on.

Michael:

Just wait two years where upon,

You'll realize guys like us are cool in college, cool in college, won't be lame.

Jeremy:

Dude I know, I get it-

Both:

Guys like us are cool in college,

Jeremy:

But we're not in college,

Michael:

All the same. High school is wack, but we have each others' back. It's me and you,

Both:

We make it a two player game.

(Spoken)

AH-

OH-

ZOMBIE!

(Jeremy's dad) Hello?

BLOOD!

(Jeremy's dad) Son?

CLAWS!

(Jeremy's dad) JEREMY!

Pause.



Jeremy (sung):

You know that you are my favorite person, that doesn't mean that I can't still dream.

Michael:

Is it really true, I'm your favowite pewson~?

Jeremy:

Yeah, we're never not gonna be a team!

High school is shit, and you gotta help me conquer it.

It's just what we do,

Both:

We make it a two player game!

Find the bad guy, push 'em aside.

Then move on forward with your friend at your side.

It's a two-player game, so when they make an attack,

You know you got a brother gonna have your back.

Then you stay on track, and I remain on course.

If they give you a smack, you gotta use your force.

And if you leave your brother behind, it's lame!

Cause it's an effed up world, and it's a two-player game!

Two player game! Two player game! Hey-ey-ey!
