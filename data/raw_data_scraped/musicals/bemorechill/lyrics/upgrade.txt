Upgrade




This is my favorite place behind the school



Being here, with you right now

Our future is so clear

Our union is so near



Being here, with you right now

I'll tenderly guide you

Just take me inside you, forever



Your life was so pitiful before

Now it's time to go all the way and more



You gotta get an upgrade (upgrade) upgrade

You gotta get an upgrade (upgrade) upgrade



Don't worry about the guilt you feel

Just take a breath and seal the deal

Damn



Gotta get an upgra-a-ade

You gotta get an upgra-a-ade



Do you wanna come over?

To my place tonight

We'll get all sporty and play cricket

Or get a 40 and just kick it



My parents won't be home so it's alright

They laundered money now they're on the run

Wai- tha-that's illegal

Which means the house is empty, so that's fun

Oh yeah



Never hung with a girl like you before

I don't know if you know it, but I am sure



That for me you are an upgrade (upgrade) upgrade

Let's be each other's upgrade (oh wow) upgrade



While I am flattered, this is new

Still, I'm not sure what I should do



You gotta take the upgra-a-ade

Gotta take the upgra-a-ade



C-c-c'mon Jeremy, can't you see

We got a plan, now be a man

You start with Brooke, and then progress

And we assess and soon success

Will intervene, by which I mean



Christine

Christine (Christine)

Michael?

Where've you been all day?



Really? So you're not the one who's been avoiding me?



It's called optic nerve blocking.

I have been blocking Michael from your field of vision.



Wait, what?



Michael is a link to Jeremy 1.0

To upgrade, you have to be willing to make sacrifices.



Seriously, what's up with you? You've been acting shady ever since- since...

It worked, didn't it?

Huh, Jeremy!

That's amazing!

We gotta test it out! No, we gotta celebrate! We gotta get stoned in my basement!



I already know what it's like to be the loser

I should find out what it's like to not be the loser

I don't wanna be special

I just wanna be chill as life will allow



Should I take the upgrade?

(Upgrade, upgrade, cont.)

Should I take the upgrade?

(No, no, no, cont.)



And I wasn't sure before

But now I wanna go all the way and more



So give me that upgrade (upgrade, upgrade)

Give me that upgrade (upgrade, upgrade, upgrade)

Tried to be genuine and true

But now it's time for something new

So give me that upgrade (upgrade, upgrade)

Give me that upgrade (upgrade, upgrade)

Maybe it doesn't matter how

I'm getting the upgrade right now



Jeremy, are you coming?



Optic nerve blocking on.



Now, let's get to work.



(Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh)
