Halloween


BROOKE:

Picked out a costume for tonight

Made sure to get a size that was a lot too tight

You can kinda see my business

But I’ll act like I don’t know

Whoa



JAKE:

I got a condom



CHLOE:

And a flask



RICH:

I stole my older brother’s Jason mask

And I don’t have a machete

But a loaf of bread will do

Ooo



JAKE (spoken):

Who’s ready for my Halloween party?!



JAKE

Everybody’s got a red Solo cup

Fill it up, fill it up

Hear the beer spill on the ground



JAKE, BROOKE:

Everybody’s all like “Sup?”



JAKE, BROOKE, RICH:

“Yo man, sup?!”



JAKE, BROOKE:

Let’s catch up, let’s smoke up



JAKE, BROOKE, CHLOE:

Look at how many drinks I’ve downed



JAKE, BROOKE, CHLOE, RICH:

Every single song’s like “Whup,” they’re all “Whup!”

We’re like “Yup! Turn it up!”

As we stumble to the sound



JAKE, BROOKE, CHLOE, RICH, JENNA, AND OFF-STAGE VOICES:

‘Cause a Halloween party’s a rad excuse

To put your body through mad abuse

And I might pass out, but it’s alright

‘Cause I’m Halloween partying hard tonight

It’s Halloween

It’s Halloween



(JEREMY enters with THE SQUIP)



BROOKE (spoken):

Jeremy!

I was afraid you weren’t coming.

Did you get my messages?



THE SQUIP (spoken):

Play it off.



JEREMY (spoken):

Am I late? I didn’t even realize.



BROOKE (spoken):

What do you think of my costume?

I figured, you always see sexy cats, but no one ever goes as a sexy dog.



JEREMY (spoken):

Uh, it’s...



THE SQUIP (spoken):

Vague compliment.



JEREMY (spoken):

...original.

I mean, amazing.

Seriously.

I can’t believe I’m with a girl who looks like you.



BROOKE (spoken):

You need a drink.



ALL:

Crank the bass, it’s Halloween

Break a vase, it’s Halloween

Jello shots! It’s Halloween

Liver spots from Halloween

Everybody’s got a red Solo cup

Fill it up, fill it up

Hear the beer spill on the ground

Everybody’s all like “Sup?” “Yo man, sup?!”

Let’s catch up, let’s smoke up

Look at how many drinks I’ve downed

Every single song’s like “Whup,” they’re all “Whup!”

We’re like “Yup! Turn it up!”

As we stumble to the sound

‘Cause a Halloween party’s a rad excuse

To put your body through mad abuse

And I might pass out, but it’s alright

‘Cause I’m Halloween partying hard tonight

It’s Halloween

It’s Halloween
