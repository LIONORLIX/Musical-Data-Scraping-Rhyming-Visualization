I'm Wishing/One Song


Make a wish into the well

That's all you have to do

And if you hear it echoing

Your wish will soon come true



I'm wishing (I'm wishing) for the one I love

To find me (to find me) today

I'm hoping (I'm hoping)

And I'm dreaming of

The nice things (the nice things) he'll say (he'll say)



Ha ha ha ha ha (ha ha ha ha ha)

Ha ha ha ha ha (ha ha ha ha ha)

Ha ha ha ha ha (ha ha ha ha ha)

Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha



I'm wishing (I'm wishing) for the one I love

To find me (to find me) today

Prince: Today!







One Song

I have but one song

One song

Only for you

One heart

Tenderly beating

Ever entreating

Constant and true

One love

That has possessed me

One love

Thrilling me through

One song

My heart keeps singing

Of one love

Only for you
