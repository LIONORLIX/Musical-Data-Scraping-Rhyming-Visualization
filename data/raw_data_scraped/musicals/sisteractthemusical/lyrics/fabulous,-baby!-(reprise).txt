Fabulous, Baby! (Reprise)


Deloris:

Gonna walk out that courthouse

And find me a nightclub to sing at.



[and none of this downtown disco -

Some place classy.]



Gonna get me an agent,

The money the fame the whole deal,

[and this time aint nothing stopping me]

Gonna knock the world out,

And there ain't any fence i won't swing at.

I?m tomorrow sensation,

The new disco queen,

The next double deckered,

Hit record machine.

A bomb shell-to-be

Like the world's never seen.

And, no, i won't miss

That whole sister routine!



[ladies and gentlemen, get ready!

Deloris van cartier is back!]



Look at my star

Risin' right on cue!

Look at my dreams

As the all come true!

Look at me now,

Baby, dig that view!



[lights! Glitter! Glamour!]



Look at my act, baby! Ain?tcha wowed?

Everything goes, and it's all allowed!

I?m back in business with my own crowd!



[backups! Dancers!

And of course my fans! C?mon, people!

Lemme feel the love!]



Look at me!

Can'tcha see -

'Cause i'm good as gone. (ooooh)
