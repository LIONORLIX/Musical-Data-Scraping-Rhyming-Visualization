Sister Act (Reprise)


Deloris:

Take me to heaven...

Take me to paradise...



Mother superior:

Receive my humple prayer...

The faith that i bear...

Accept my sacrifice.

Take all my heart and soul...



Mary patrick:

My joy and love...



Mary lazarus:

I am ready, sweet lord above.



Nuns:

[take me, take me, take me, take me, take me

Take me, take me, take me, take me, take me]



Deloris:

I've got my sisters by my side.

I've got my sisters love and pride.

And with my sisters here,

I have no fear -

I'm right where i should be.

And with my sisters in my heart,

I know we'll never be apart.

And no one on this earth

Can change that fact -

My brave sisters,

My sweet sisters,

My strong sisters,

All my loving sisters -

I'm part of one terrific sister act.
