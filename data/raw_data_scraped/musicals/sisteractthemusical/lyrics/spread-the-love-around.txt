All things being even,

Here’s what i believe in -

Nothing matters more than love.



Deloris:

Friendship and affection...

Real connection...

It’s a gift from above.



Mother superior:

Every song that we play -



Deloris:

Every prayer that we pray -



Mother suprior/deloris:

Makes a bond in a way that’s profound.



Mother superior:

We’re just here to spread that love all around...



Deloris:

Spread it around...



Mother superior:

Spread it around!

Po-ho -ho the po...

Nuns:

Ooooooooooooh

Oh wah



Start a conversation,

Throw a celebration,

Let whatever’s in you out!

Welcoming and sharing,

Simply caring

That’s what live is about.



Don’t just sit on the side,

Go along for the ride -

With your heart open wide as it goes!

Let love’s music fill you down to your toes!



And get up!

Get up and join the crowd on the floor!

Jump in!

Jump in, that’s what your spirit is for.

Reach out!

Reach out, embrace the love thatcha found!

Then go ahead.

Let it spread all around!



Get down!

Get down, with all your heart and your soul!

Dance on!

Dance on, become a part of the whole!

Don’t stop!

Don’t stop, until your lost in the sound!

Life’s only love -

Spread the love around!



Spread it ‘round!

A-a-a-a-a-h-h-h-h

Spread it 'round!

A-a-a-a-a-h-h-h-h

Spread it around!

Ahhhhhhhhh



Deloris:

Once you start to spread it,

Baby, if you let it.

Love comes right on back to you!

Passion and devotion,

Real emotion -

Watch it come burstin' through!

So give in to the beat,

And get knocked off your feet -

Let it sweep you completely away!

And get up!
