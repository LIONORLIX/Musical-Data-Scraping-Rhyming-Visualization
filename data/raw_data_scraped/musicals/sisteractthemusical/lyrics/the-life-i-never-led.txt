The Life I Never Led


Mary robert:

I've never talked back,

I've never slept late,

I've never sat down

When told to stand straight

I've never let go

And gone with the flow,

And don't even know, really, why.

I've never asked questions,

Or taken a dare.

I've never worn clothes

That might make people stare.

I've never rebelled,

Or stood up and yelled,

Or even just held my head high.



And all of the feelings unspoken,

All of the truths unsaid,

They're all i have left

Of the life i never led.



I've never gone surfing,

Or ran with a crowd.

Or danced on a table,

Or laughed much too loud.

I've never quite dared

To leave myself bared -

I've just been too scared i might fall,

I've never seen paris,

Swum naked,

Been kissed.

I've never quite realised

Just how much i've missed

And what did i get

For hedging each bet?

Another regret, and that's all.

And all of the wishes unasked for,

All of needs unfed -

They're all that remain

Of the life i never led.



And now...

Now that you've given me one

Little taste of it -

And now...

Now that i know what i know -

Well how...

How can i go on ignoring the waste of it?

After all of the years

That i've clung to my fears.

Won't you help me let go?

Help me let go!



I want to be brave,

I want to be strong.

I want to believe

I'm where i belong.

To stand up and say

"i'm seizing the day"

To not just obey, but to choose.

And i may not surf,

I may not see france.

But i want to know

I still have the chance.

And maybe i'll make

A painful mistake.

It's mine though, to take or refuse.

And all of the doors yet to open,

All of the rooms ahead -

They're beaconing bright,

Scary and new -

But i'm standing tall,

And i'm walking through.

What's gone may be gone,

But i won't go on

Playing dead!

It's time to start living

The life i never led.
