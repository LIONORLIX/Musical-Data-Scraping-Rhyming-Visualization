Do The Sacred Mass


Deloris:

[now, who's been bad in the eyes of our lord?

Well, it's time to come clean!]



First ya’ sprinkle holy water

Then ya’ wave the holy book

Then ya’ do a special blessing

And then ya shake around

Your rosary

‘til everybody bead is shook.

And shout hail mary!



Bikers:

Hail mary!



Deloris:

Shout our father!



Bikers:

Our father!



Deloris:

Better pray it like ya mean it,

Or don't bother!



Bikers:

Whooooo!



Deloris

We ain't got them fancy wafers

Butcha all can lift a glass

So raise your cup



Bikers:

Yeah!



Deloris:

Drink up!



Bikers:

Yeah!





Deloris:

That's how you do the sacred mass.



Mary patrick:

Now let's exorcise the devil.



Bikers:

The devil!



Mary lazarus:

Grind them demons in the ground.



Mary patrick

Grind ‘em in the ground.



Mary patrick:

Next you baptize all the heathens.



Bikers:

Baptize the heathens!



Deloris:

And then ya do-si-do your partner

And you swing 'em all around,

And shout hosanna!



Bikers

Hosanna!



Deloris

Holy moses!





Bikers:

Holy moses!





Deloris:

Then ya strike a buncha

Catholic - lookin' poses!



Bikers:

Whooo!



Deloris:

If ya wanna free your conscience,

First ya gotta free your ass.

Now say amen



Bikers:

Amen!



Deloris:

And then.

Come on and do the sacred mass!



Lemme see the congregation

Do some freestyle adoration,

Just like baby jesus commands!

Praise the lord, then hallelujah,

Grab whoever’s closest to ya!

We’ll do confession later,

But right now,

Lay on those hands!
