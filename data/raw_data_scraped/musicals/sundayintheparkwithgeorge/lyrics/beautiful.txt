Beautiful


[[Old Lady]]

Changing...

It keeps changing

I see towers

Where there were trees

Going,

All the stillness

The solitude,

Georgie

Sundays

Disappearing

All the time

When things were beautiful...



[[George]]

All things are beautiful

Mother

All trees, all towers

Beautiful

That tower-

Beautiful, Mother

See?

A perfect tree



Pretty isn't beautiful, Mother

Pretty is what changes

What the eye arranges

Is what is beautiful



[[Old Lady]]

Fading



[[George]]

I'm changing

You're changing



[[Old Lady]]

It keeps fading...



[[George]]

I'll draw us now before we fade

Mother



[[Old Lady]]

It keeps melting

Before our eyes



[[George]]

You watch

While I revise the world



[[Old Lady]]

Changing,

As we sit here-

Quick, draw it all

Georgie...



[[Both]]

Sundays-



[[Old Lady]]

Disappearing,

As we look-



[[George]]

Look! Look!



[[Old Lady]]

You make it beautiful

Oh, Georgie, how I long for the old view
