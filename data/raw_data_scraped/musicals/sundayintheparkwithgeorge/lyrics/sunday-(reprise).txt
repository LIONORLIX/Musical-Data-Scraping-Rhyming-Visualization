Sunday (Reprise)


[[George]]

Dot, why did you write these words?



[[Dot]]

They are your words George. The ones you muttered so often when you worked.



[[George]]

"Order"

"Design"

"Tension"

"Composition"

"Balance"

"Light"

Dot, I cannot read this word



[[Dot]]

Harmony



[[George]]

So much love in his words... forever with his colors...

how George looks... he can look forever... what does he see? ...his

eyes so dark and shiny... so careful... so exact...



[[All]]

Sunday

By the blue

Purple yellow red water

On the green

Purple yellow red grass,

As we pass

Through arrangements of shadows

Towards the verticals of tree



Forever

By the blue

Purple yellow red water

On the green

Orange violet mass

Of the grass



[[Dot]]

In our perfect park



[[George]]

Made of flecks of light

And dark



[[All]]

And Parasols...



People strolling through the trees

Of a small suburban park

On an island in the river

On an ordinary Sunday...

Sunday...



[[George]]

White. A blank page of canvas. His favorite. So many possibilities...
