Color and Light


[[George]]

Order.

Design.

Composition.

Tone.

Form.

Symmetry.

Balance.



More red...

And a little more red...

Blue blue blue blue

Blue blue blue blue

Even even...

Good...

Bumbum bum bumbumbum

Bumbum bum...

More red...

More blue...

More beer...

More light!

Color and light.

There's only color and light.

Yellow and white.

Just blue and yellow and white.

Look at the air, miss-

See whet I mean?

No, look over there, miss-

That's done with green...

Conjoined with orange...



[[Dot]]

Nothing seems to fit me right. The less I wear, the more comfortable I feel.

More rouge...

George is very special. Maybe I'm just not special enough for him.

If my legs were longer.

It my bust was smaller.

It my hands were graceful.

If my waist was thinner.

If my hips were flatter.

If my voice was warm.

If I could concentrate-



I'd be in the Follies.

I'd be in a cabaret.

Gentlemen in tall silk hats

And linen spats

Would wait with flowers.

I could make them wait for hours.

Giddy young aristocrats

With fancy flats

Would drink my health,

And I would be as

Hard as nails...

And they'd only want me more...



If I was a folly girl.

Nah, I wouldn't like it much.

Married men and stupid boys

And too much smoke end all that noise

And all that color and light...



[[George]]

Aren't you proper today, miss?

Your parasol so properly cocked, your bustle so perfectly upright.

And you sir. Your hat so black. So black to you, perhaps.

So red to me.



[[Dot]]

None of the others worked at night...



[[George]]

So composed for a Sunday.



[[Dot]]

How do you work without the right

White

Light?

How do you fathom George?



[[George]]

Red red red red

Red red orange

Red red orange

Orange pick up blue

Pick up red

Pick up orange

From the blue-green blue-green

Blue-green circle

On the violet diagonal

Di-ag-ag-ag-ag-ag-o-nal-nal

Yellow comma yellow comma

Numnum num numnumnum

Numnum num...

Blue blue blue blue

Blue still sitting

Red that perfume

Blue all night

Blue-green the window shut

Dut dut dut

Dot Dot sitting

Dot Dot waiting

Dot Dot getting fat fat fat

More yellow

Dot Dot waiting to go

Out out out

No no no George

Finish the hat finish the hat

Have to finish the hat first

Hat hat hat hat

Hot hot hot it's hot in here...

Sunday!

Color and light!



[[Dot]]

But how George looks. He could look forever.



[[George]]

There's only color and light.



[[Dot]]

As if he sees you and he doesn't all at once.



[[George]]

Purple and white...



[[Dot]]

What is he thinking when he looks like that?



[[George]]

And red and purple and white.



[[Dot]]

What does he see? Sometimes, not even blinking.



[[George]]

Look at this glade, girls,

Your cool blue spot.



[[Dot]]

His eyes. So dark and shiny.



[[George]]

No, stay in the shade, girls.

It's getting hot...



[[Dot]]

Some think cold and black.



[[George]]

It's getting orange...



[[Dot]]

But it's warm inside his eyes...



[[George]]

Hotter..



[[Dot]]

And it's soft inside his eyes...

And he burns you with his eyes...



[[George]]

Look at her looking.



[[Dot]]

And you're studied like the light.



[[George]]

Forever with that mirror. What does she see?



[[Dot]]

And you look inside the eyes.



[[George]]

The pink lips, the red cheeks...



[[Dot]]

And you catch him here and there.



[[George]]

The wide eyes. Studying the round face, the tiny pout...



[[Dot]]

But he's never really there.



[[George]]

Seeing all the parts and none of the whole.



[[Dot]]

You want him even more.



[[George]]

But the way she catches light...



[[Dot]]

And you drown inside his eyes...



[[George]]

And the color of her hair...



[[George & Dot]]

I could look at her/him
