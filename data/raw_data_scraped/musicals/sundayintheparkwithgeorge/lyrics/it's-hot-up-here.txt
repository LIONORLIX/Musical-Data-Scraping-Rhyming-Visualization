It's Hot Up Here


[[Dot]]

It's hot up here



[[Yvonne]]

It's hot and it's monotonous



[[Louise]]

I want my glasses



[[Nurse]]

This is not my good profile



[[Celeste #2]]

Nobody can even see my profile



[[Celeste #1]]

I hate this dress



[[Celeste #2]]

The soldiers have forgotten us



[[Frieda]]

The boatman schwitzes



[[Jules]]

I am completely out of proportion



[[Soldier]]

These helmets weigh a lot on us



[[Old Lady]]

This tree is blocking my view



[[Louise]]

I can't see anything



[[Boatman]]

Why are they complaining?

It could have been raining



[[Dot]]

I hate these people



[[All]]

It's hot up here

A lot up here

It's hot up here

Forever

A lot of fun

It's not up here

It's hot up here

No matter what



There's not a breath

Of air up here

And they're up here

Forever

It's not my fault

I got up here

I'll rot up here

I am so hot up here



[[Yvonne]]

Darling, don't clutch mother's hand quite so tightly

Thank you



[[Celeste #1]]

It's hot up here



[[Frieda]]

At least you have a parasol



[[Soldier, Nurse, Yvonne, & Louise]]

Well, look who's talking

Sitting in the shade



[[Jules]]

I trust my cigar is not bothering you

Unfortunately, it never goes out



[[Soldier (to Companion)]]

It's good to be together again



[[Celeste #2]]

See, I told you they were odd



[[Celeste #1]]

Don't slouch



[[Louise]]

He took my glasses



[[Yvonne]]

You've been eating something sticky



[[Nurse]]

I put on rouge today, too...



[[Frieda]]

Don't you ever take a bath?



[[Old Lady]]

Nurse! Hand me my fan



[[Nurse]]

I can't



[[Celeste #2]]

At least the brat is with her mother



[[Louise]]

I heard that!



[[Jules (to Dot)]]

Do you like tall grass?



[[Frieda]]

Hah!



[[Yvonne]]

Jules!



[[Boatman]]

Bunch of animals...



[[Dot]]

I hate these people



[[All]]

It's hot up here

And strange up here

No change up here

Forever



How still it is

How odd it is

And God, it is

So hot!



[[Soldier]]

I like the one in the light hat



[[Dot]]

Hello George

I do not wish to be remembered

Like this, George,

With them, George

My hem, George

Three inches off the ground

And then this monkey

And these people, George

They'll argue till they fade

And whisper things and grunt

But thank you for the shade

And putting me in front

Yes, thank you, George, for that...

And for the hat...



[[Celeste #1]]

It's hot up here



[[Yvonne]]

It's hot and it's monotonous



[[Louise]]

I want my glasses!



[[Franz]]

This is not my good profile



[[Celeste #1]]

I hate this dress



[[Celeste #2]]

The soldiers have forgotten us



[[Celeste #1]]

Don't slouch!



[[Boatman]]

Animals...



[[Jules]]

Are you sure you don't like tall grass



[[Nurse]]

I put on rouge today, too...



[[Frieda]]

Don't you ever take a bath?



[[Soldier]]

It's good to be together again



[[Old Lady]]

Nurse, hand me my fan



[[Dot]]

It's hot up here



[[Yvonne]]

It's hot and It's monotonous



[[Louise]]

He took my glasses, I want my glasses!



[[Franz]]

This is not my good profile



[[All]]

And furthermore,

Finding you're

Fading

Is very degrading

And God, I am so hot!

Well, there are worse things than sweating

By a river on a Sunday

There are worse things than sweating by a river



[[Boatman]]

When you're sweating in a picture

That was painted by a genius



[[Nurse]]

And you know that you're immortal



[[Frieda]]

And you'll always be remembered



[[Nurse]]

Even if they never see you



[[Old Lady]]

And you're listening to drivel



[[Soldier]]

And you're part of your companion



[[Louise]]

And your glasses have been stolen



[[Yvonne]]

And you're bored beyond endurance



[[Louis]]

And the baby has no diapers



[[Celeste #1 (to Celeste #2)]]

And you're slouching



[[Celeste #2]]

I am not!



[[Jules]]

And you are out of all proportion



[[Dot]]

And I hate these people!



[[All]]

You never get

A breeze up here,

And she's (he's)

up here

Forever

You cannot run

Amok up here

You're stuck up here

In this gavotte



Perspectives don't

Make sense up here

It's tense up here

Forever

The outward show

Of bliss up here

Is disappearing dot by dot

And it's hot!
