[[All]]

Sunday, by the blue purple yellow red water

On the green purple yellow red grass

Let us pass through our perfect park

Pausing on a Sunday



By the cool blue triangular water

On the soft green elliptical grass

As we pass through arrangements of shadow

Toward the verticals of trees

Forever



By the blue purple yellow red water

On the green orange violet mass of the grass

In our perfect park



[[George]]

Made of flecks of light

And dark

And parasols

Bum bum bum bum bum bum

Bum bum bum



People strolling through the trees

Of a small suburban park

On an island in the river

On and ordinary Sunday

Sunday

Sunday
