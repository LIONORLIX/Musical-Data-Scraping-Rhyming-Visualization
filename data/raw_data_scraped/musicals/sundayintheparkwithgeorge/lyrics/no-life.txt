No Life


[[Jules]]

Ahh...



[[Yvonne]]

Ooh...



[[Jules]]

Mmm...



[[Yvonne]]

Oh, dear.



[[Jules]]

Oh, my.



[[Yvonne]]

Oh, my dear.



[[Jules]]

It has no prescence.



[[Yvonne]]

No passion.



[[Jules]]

No life.

It's neither pastoral

Nor lyrical.



[[Yvonne]]

You don't suppose that it's satirical?



[[Jules]]

Just density

Without intensity-



[[Yvonne]]

No life.

Boys with their clothes off-



[[Jules]]

I must paint a factory next!



[[Yvonne]]

It's so mechanical.



[[Jules]]

Methodical.



[[Yvonne]]

It might be in some dreary

Socialistic periodical.



[[Jules]]

Good.



[[Yvonne]]

So drab, so cold.



[[Jules]]

And so controlled.



[[Both]]

No life.



[[Jules]]

His touch is too deliberate, somehow.



[[Yvonne]]

The dog.



[[Jules]]

These things get hung-



[[Yvonne]]

Mmm.



[[Jules]]

And then they're gone.



[[Yvonne]]

Ahhh...

Of course he's young-



[[Jules]]

Hmm?



[[Yvonne]]

But getting on.



[[Jules]]

Oh...

All mind, no heart.

No life in his art.



[[Yvonne]]

No life in his life-



[[Both]]

No-

Life.
