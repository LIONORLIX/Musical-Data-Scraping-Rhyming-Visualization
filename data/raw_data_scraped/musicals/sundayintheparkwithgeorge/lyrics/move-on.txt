Move On


[[Dot]]

Are you working on something new?



[[George]]

No



[[Dot]]

That is not like you, George



[[George]]

I've nothing to say



[[Dot]]

You have many things



[[George]]

Well, nothing that's not been said



[[Dot]]

Said by you, though. George



[[George]]

I do not know where to go



[[Dot]]

And nor did I



[[George]]

I want to make things that count,

Things that will be new...



[[Dot]]

I did what I had to do...



[[George]]

What am I to do?



[[Dot]]

Move on...



Stop worrying where you're going-

Move on

If you can know where you're going

You've gone

Just keep moving on



I chose, and my world was shaken-

So what?

The choice may have been mistaken,

The choosing was not

You have to move on



Look at what you want,

Not at where you are,

Not at what you'll be-

Look at all the things you've done for me



Opened up my eyes,

Taught me how to see,

Notice every tree-



[[George]]

Notice every tree...



[[Dot]]

Understand the light-



[[George]]

...Understand the light...



[[Dot]]

Concentrate on now-



[[George]]

I want to move on

I want to explore the light

I want to know how to get through,

Through to something new,

Something of my own-



[[Both]]

Move on

Move on



[[Dot]]

Stop worrying it your vision

Is new

Let others make that decision-

They usually do

You keep moving on



-------Voice Over Voice-------

[[George]]

Something in the light,

Something in the sky,

In the grass,

Up behind the trees...

Things I hadn't looked at

Till now

Flower in your hat.

And your smile

And the color of your hair.



[[Dot]]

Look at what you've done,

Then at what you want,

Not at where you are,

What you'll be

Look at all the things

You gave to me

Let me give to you

Something in return

I would be so pleased...

------End Voice Over Voice------



[[George]]

And the way you catch the light

And the care

And the feeling

And the life

Moving on



[[Dot]]

We've always belonged

Together!



[[Both]]

We will always belong

Together!



[[Dot]]

Just keep moving on

Anything you do

Let it come from you

Then it will be new

Give us more to see...
