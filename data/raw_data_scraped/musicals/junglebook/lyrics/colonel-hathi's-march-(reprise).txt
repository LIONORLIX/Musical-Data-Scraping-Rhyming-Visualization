Colonel Hathi's March (Reprise)


Oh, we march from here to there

And it doesn't matter where

You can hear us push

Through the deepest bush

With a military air!

With a military air!



We're a cracker jack brigade

On a pachyderm parade

But we'd rather stroll to a water hole

For a furlough in the shade!

For a furlough in the shade!
