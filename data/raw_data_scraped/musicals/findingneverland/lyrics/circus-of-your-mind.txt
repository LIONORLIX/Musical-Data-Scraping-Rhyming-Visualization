Circus of Your Mind


Charles:



I've heard enough you're losing your mind

You're speaking in riddles and the riddles don't rhyme,

You want flying children up there on the stage

Dogs wearing aprons and boys who don't age.



You say I will adore it but I'm paying for it

A little more reality and less of this insanity.

How am I gonna to face it,

such a disgrace yet here we go again and again and again



You are living on a merry go round and round you seem to go and

I'll never understand why

You want people floating weightless Ceilings

Where the floors should be these are all the things

You will find in the circus of your mind.



Mary:



I've resigned myself to spend all my life

To be all the things one expects from a wife.

Your Imagination is where you reside

And my invitation has never arrive



Darling Though you try you cannot deny

She's on every single page of your journal James

Now we have to face it such a disgrace yet

There you go again and again and again



It's like living on a merry-go-round and round we seem to go yet,

I never seem to know why

I'm hearing people whisper quietly friends are now avoiding me

It's over I'm leaving you behind to the circus of your mind



Mrs. Du Maurier



There Has been nothing but trouble

And strife ever since you came in to this family's life

So much disruption the children don't need

And as for my daughter I must interseen.

Everything about you they can do without you take flights of fantasy

I question your morality I told them to ignore you now I must implore you.

Leave them alone stay away we all know



You are living on a merry-go-round and round you seem to go understand

That we have no time for the circus of your mind



Charles:



Clock is ticking James Stanforth Stanforth

Mary:



Laughingstock of London

Mrs. Du Maurier



spare us or crocodile tears Mr. Barrie

All:



Tick tock tick tock tick tock tick tock



Charles:



Islands children who are fairies

Mrs. Du Maurier

That man is a grown-up behaving like a boy

All:



It's like living on a marry go round

And round you seem to go no one seems to know why we're doing everything

That we can do to get through to you,

Try to make you see but you're blind in the circus of your mind



In the circus

In the circus

In the circus



Of your mind
