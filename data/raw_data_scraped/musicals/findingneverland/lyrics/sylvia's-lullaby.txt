Sylvia's Lullaby


Sylvia:

Quietly hush now to sleep

On the wings of a butterfly

Let all your cares drift away

For now is the end of the day



If you close your eyes and count to ten

You'll hear your dream are calling again

Just follow the moon, for all to soon

A new day will appear



You'll have nothing to fear

For wherever you are

And forever

I'll be here
