Stronger


In the darkest place,

there's the faintest light,

as we hope to face,

the hardest fight fate delivers me.

I don't need their sympathy.



Cause they can't take away my mind,

where I will go they will never find.



I've got to be stronger,

reach up higher,

must dig deeper, find the fire.



Feel enlightened, can't be frightened any more.



I can run now, so much faster.

Now defeat won't be my master.

For to conquer the demons I won't have to wait any longer.



I've got to be stronger.



You'll see in time. You will survive.

Too soon to run, too late to hide.

It's your destiny, every pace, every stride.



I am stronger,

reach up higher,

digging deeper,

found the fire.



Feel enlightened,

won't be frightened any more.



I can run now,

so much faster.

Now defeat won't,

be my master.



For to conquer the demons,

I won't have to wait any longer.



I've got to be stronger.



I am stronger.



Now I'm stronger.
