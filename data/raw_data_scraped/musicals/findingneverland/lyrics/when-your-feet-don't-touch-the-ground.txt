When Your Feet Don't Touch the Ground


Barrie:

When did life become so complicated?

Year of too much thought and time I wasted

And in each line upon my face

Is proof I fought and lived another day



When did life become this place of madness?

Drifting on an empty sea of waves of sadness

I make believe I'm in control

And dream it wasn't all my fault



When your feet don't touch the ground

And your world's turn upside down

Here it's safe

In this place

Above the clouds



When you feet don't touch the earth

You can't feel the things that hurt

And you're free

There's no need

To come down



Peter:

Every day just feels a little longer

Why am I the only one not getting stronger

Running round pretending life's a play

Doesn't make the darkness go away



I may be young but I can still remember

Feeling full of joy, crying tears of laughter

Now all my tears are ll cried out

Make believe but count me out



Cause my feet are on the ground

And the inner voice I found

Tells the truth

There's no use

If your head's in the clouds



Barrie:

I was once like you

Life was a maze

I couldn't find my way out

But what I say is true

You'll be amazed

Make believe and you will find out that it's true



Peter:

I know what is true



Both:

When your feet don't touch the ground

And your voice won't make a sound



Barrie: Here it's safe

Peter: It tells the truth



Barrie: In this place

Peter: There's no use



Barrie Above the clouds

Peter: The clouds



Both: When your feet

Barrie: Don't touch the earth

Peter: Touch the earth



Both: You can't feel the things that hurt



Barrie: And you're free

Peter: And I am fine



Barrie: There's no need

Peter: As long as I



Barrie: To come down

Peter: Down



Both: When your feet

Barrie: Don't touch the ground

Peter: Touch the ground



Barrie: When your feet don't

Both: Touch the ground
