What You Mean to Me


James:

Standing here

All at once

All the words run dry



Sylvia:

Something changed

Can't explain

And I can't deny



James:

Turning in circles

And blurring the lights



Both:

The unspoken is calling us tonight



I won't lie

I'm a little bit frightend

Of my imagination

Swear I'll try

I'm feeling enlightened

Your my inspiration

We can fly if we want to

I promise that faith will give you wings



James:

Just take the second star on the right

Straight ahead till morning light



Both:

Just take the second star on the right

Straight ahead till morning light



James:

Every word and every sentence

Doesn't seem to make a difference

Nothing can explain just what you mean to me



Sylvia:

Every shape and all the colors

All the love from all the lovers

Never quite express just what you mean to me



James (Sylvia):

(Every shape) Every sentance

Every feeling (Every breath)

Breathless

All my senses reeling (All my sences reeling)

Cannot even say just



Both:

What you mean to me



Turning in circles

And blurring the lights



I won't lie

I'm a little bit frightened (Sylvia in cannon)

Of my imagination

I swear I'll try

Your my inspiration (Now together)



We can fly if we want to

I promise faith will give you wings

Just take the second star on the right straight ahead till morning light

Just take the second star on the right straight ahead till morning light



Every star that's ever fallen

Knows the way to where we're going

Now I really know just what you mean to me...
