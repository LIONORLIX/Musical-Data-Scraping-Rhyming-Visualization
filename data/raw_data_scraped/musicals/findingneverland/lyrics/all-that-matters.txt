All That Matters


There are days when I feel so afraid I can hardly remember to breathe.

When reality crashes in wave after wave, pulling me further beneath.

So what's the point here planning for a future, if it all can be stolen away'

It's all I can do to hold on and survive, when the colors have faded to gray.

But my children need so much more from me,

And they give me the strength to go on;

Whatever may come:



All that matters now, is where I go from here.

There's an easier way if I live for today

The beating of my heart is all that matters.



He makes sense of all of my chaos in ways I could never explain,

He turns all of my sadness into smile, he's helping live life again

It's the light in the eyes of my children

It's the sound of their laughter once more

It's a glimpse of a life I dared only to dream

And a dream only life could restore;

And I know that some may not understand

But he's guiding me safely to shore

Not afraid anymore



All that matters now, is where I go from here

There's an easier way if I live for today

The singing in my heart is all that matters.



It takes me far away

There's an easier way if I live for today

The singing in my heart is all that matters.
