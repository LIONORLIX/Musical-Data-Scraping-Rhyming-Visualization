Ruby Baby


MATT:

I got a girl and Ruby is her name

She don't love me but I love her just the same

Ruby Baby how I want you

Like a ghost I'm gonna haunt you

Ruby Baby when will you be mine



Each time I see you baby my heart cries

I'm gonna steal you away from all those guys

From the very day I met you

I made a bet that I would get you

Ruby Baby when will you be mine

Ruby Ruby when will you be mine

Ruby Ruby when will you be...

When will you be mine

Oh, yeah!



Ruby, when will you be mine

Rudy, Ruby, Ruby Baby

Ruby, when will you be mine

Tell when will you be mine

Ruby, when will you be mine

Rudy Baby, Ruby Baby, Ruby Baby,

Ruby, when will you be mine

When will you be mine
