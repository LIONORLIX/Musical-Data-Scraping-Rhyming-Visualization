Stay a While


Stay awhile, let me hold you

Stay awhile, 'till I've told you oh oh

Of the love that I feel tonight oh yeah



Stay awhile what's your hurry?

Stay awhile, 'cause I worry oh oh

Any time that you're out of sight



I hate to see you go Tell you what I'll do I'll be good to you

I'll make you glad that you are mine, so come on baby



Treat me right, must you run now

For the night's just begun now oh oh

Honey please, won't you stay awhile with meoh yeh yeh



(break)



Oh I hate to see you go Tell you what I'll do I'll be good to you

I'll make you glad that you are mine, so come on baby



Treat me right, must you run now

For the night's just begun now oh oh

Honey please, won't you stay awhile with meoh yeh yeh

Stay awhile with me.
