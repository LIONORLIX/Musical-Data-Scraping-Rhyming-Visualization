Baby, That Is Rock & Roll


(spoken)

in the beggining there was nothing but rocks

then somebody invented the wheel

and things just begun to roll



did you ever hear a tenor sax

swinging like a rosty axe

walking like a dog

down in a hollow log

baby that's rock and roll



did you ever hear a guitar twing

chingy chingy chingy chang

ever hear the strings

doing crazy things

baby that's rock and roll



that ain't no freight train that you'll hear

running like a rail road track

its just a country boy, pianno man

playing in between the cracks

they say that music's for the birds

but you can understand the words

well honey, if you did

you really blow your lid

cause baby that's rock and roll



(instrumental part)



that ain't no freight train that you'll hear

running like a rail road track

its just a country boy, pianno man

playing in between the cracks

did you ever hear a guitar twing

chingy chingy chingy chingy chang

ever hear the strings doing crazy thing

baby thats' rock and roll (in the morning)

baby that's rock and roll (in the evening)

baby that's rock and roll, yeah!
