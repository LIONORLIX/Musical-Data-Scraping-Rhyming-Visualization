Neighborhood (Reprise)


WOMAN'S CHORUS:

Here's a photo I've been looking for

It's a picture of the boy next door

And I loved him more than words can say

Never knew it 'til he moved away



Faded pictures in my scrapbook

Just thought I'd take one more look

And recall when we were all

In the neighborhood...
