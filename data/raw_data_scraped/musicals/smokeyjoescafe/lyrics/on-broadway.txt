On Broadway


They say the neon lights are bright

On Broadway

They say there's always magic in the air

But when you're walkin' down the street

And you ain't had enough to eat

The glitter rubs right off and you're nowhere



They say the chicks are somethin' else

On Broadway

But lookin' at them just gives me the blues

'Cause how ya gonna make some time

When all you got is one thin dime

And one thin dime won't even shine your shoes



They say that I won't last too long

On Broadway

I'll catch a Greyhound bus for home they say

But they're dead wrong, I know they are

'Cause I can play this here guitar

And I won't quit till I'm star

On Broadway



But they're dead wrong, I know they are

'Cause I can play this here guitar

And I won't quit till I'm star

On Broadway
