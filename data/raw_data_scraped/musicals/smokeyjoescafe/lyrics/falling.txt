Falling


DELEE:

If I tremble when I'm by your side

If I look a little starry eye

Darling, would you get the message

I'm falling, falling in love with you



If I'm trying hard to come on cool

And I come off looking a fool

Darling, don't you get the message

I'm falling, falling in love with you



If I don't like know just what to say

And I'm acting in a foolish way

That's the way it is to send valentines

You got to learn to read between the lines



So I keep my feelings locked in a place

I love you, it's written on my face

Darling, don't you get the message

I'm falling, falling in love with you

I'm falling in love with you

I'm falling in love with you
