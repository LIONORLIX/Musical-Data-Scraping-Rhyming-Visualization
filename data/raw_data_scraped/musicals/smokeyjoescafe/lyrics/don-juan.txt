Don Juan


The house we moved in

The house we grooved in

The way we waltzed across those marble floors

You used to look delux

In your white tie an' tux

Up in that big white house

That is no longer yours



Don Juan, your money is gone

And when your money is gone, Don

Your babe is gone

Don Juan, your babe is gone

Stiff upper lip now, Don

You have to carry on



The yatch we sailed on

The yatch we wailed on

I got to tell you, Don

I loved that yatch

You used to look so cute

In your white sailor suit

Up on that big white yatch

That you no longer got



Don Juan, your money is gone

And when your money is gone, Don

Your babe is go-one

Don Juan, your babe is gone

Stiff upper lip now, Don

You have to carry on



Don Juan, when you had money

Don Juan, I was your honey

But Don, it's gone

And so...

Am I!



The jet we cruised on

The jet we boozed on

That was the highest height we've ever flown

Your kisses were so sweet

At thirty thousand feet

Up on that big white jet

That you no longer own



Don Juan, your money is gone

And when your money is gone, Don

Aha, babe is gone

Don Juan, your babe is gone

Stiff upper lip now, Don

You have to carry on



Stiff... lip...

You thought I was saying something else, didn't ya?

Maybe now that I got some money,

I'm gonna get somebody to drag this chair around.
