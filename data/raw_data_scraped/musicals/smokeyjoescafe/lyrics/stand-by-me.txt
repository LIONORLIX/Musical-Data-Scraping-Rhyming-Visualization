Stand by Me


When the night has come

And the land is dark

And the moon

Is the only light we'll see



No, I won't be afraid

No, I won't be afraid

Just as long as you stand

Stand by me



So, darling, darling stand by me,

Oh, stand by me,

Oh stand, stand by me, stand by me



If the sea that we look upon

Should tumble and fall



Or if the mountain should crumble in the sea



I won't cry, no, I won't cry

No I won't shed a tear



Just as long, as you stand

Stand by me

So darling, darling stand by me

Oh, stand by me

Oh stand, stand by me

Stand by me.
