Dance With Me


MEN'S CHORUS:

Dance with me, dance with me, dance with me, dance with me



KEN:

Dance with me,

Hold me closer, closer and closer

Much closer while the music plays, my little darlin', won't ya

Dance with me,

Hold me tighter, tighter and tighter

Much tighter while the rhythm sways



Put your lips to mine while the music plays

We're no longer strangers

Now we're more than friends so-o-o



Dance with me, dance with me closer, closer and closer

And maybe we'll be lovers when the music ends



(Doot-doot) (Dance with me) oh-oh

(Doot-doot) (Dance with me) oh-oh

(Doot-doot) (Dance with me) oh-oh

(Doot-doot) (Dance with me) oh-oh



D.J.:

Dance with me,

Hold me closer, closer and closer

Much closer while the music plays,

My little darlin', won't ya

Dance with me,

Hold me tighter and tighter and tighter

Much tighter while the rhythm sways



Ooh, ooh,

Put your lips to mine while the music plays

We're no longer strangers

Now we're more than friends



Dance with me, dance with me closer, closer and closer

And maybe we'll be lovers when the music ends
