Poison Ivy


She comes on like a rose

but everybody knows

she'll get you in Dutch

you can look but you'd better not touch



Poison Ivy

Poison Ivy

Late at night while you're sleeping

Poison Ivy comes creeping around



She's pretty as a daisy

but look out man she's crazy

she'll really do you in

if you let her get under your skin



Measles make you mumpy

and mumps will make you lumpy

and chicken pox will make you

jump and switch



A common cold will fool you

and whooping cough can cool ya

But Poison Ivy lord will make you itch



Your gonna need an ocean

of calamine lotion

You'll be scratching like a hound

the minute you start to mess around



Poison Ivy

Poison Ivy

Late at night while you're sleeping

Poison Ivy comes creeping around



Measles make you mumpy

and mumps will make you lumpy

and chicken pox will make you

jump and switch

A common cold will fool you

and whooping cough can cool ya

But Poison Ivy lord will make you itch



Your gonna need an ocean

of calamine lotion

You'll be scratching like a hound

the minute you start to mess around



Poison Ivy

Poison Ivy

Late at night while you're sleeping

Poison Ivy comes creeping around
