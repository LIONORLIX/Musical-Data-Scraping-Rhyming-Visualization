Charlie Brown


Fe fe fi fi fo fo fum

I smell smoke in the auditorium

Charlie Brown, Charlie Brown

He's a clown, that Charlie Brown

He's gonna get caught, just you wait and see

(Why's everybody always pickin' on me?)



That's him on his knees, I know that's him

From 7 come 11 down in the boys' gym

Charlie Brown, Charlie Brown

He's a clown, that Charlie Brown

He's gonna get caught, just you wait and see

(Why's everybody always pickin' on me?)



Who's always writing on the wall?

Who's always goofin' in the hall?

Who's always throwin' spit balls?

Guess who! (Who, me?) Yeah, you!



Who walks in the classroom cool and slow?

Who calls the English teacher Daddy-O?

Charlie Brown, Charlie Brown

He's a clown, that Charlie Brown

He's gonna get caught, just you wait and see

(Why's everybody always pickin' on me?)
