Love Potion #9


I took my trouble down to madame Ruth

You know that gypsy with gold-capped tooth

She lives on the bloc down on thirty-fourth an' vine

Sellin' little bottles of

Love potion number nine



I told her that i was a flop with chicks

I'd been this way from nineteen fifty-six

She looked at my palm and she made a magic sign

Said 'uh what you need is

Love potion number nine



She bent down an' turned around an' give me a wink

She said I'm gonna mix it up right here in the sink

It smelled like turpentine an' looked like Indian ink

I held my nose I closed my eyes

I took a drink



I didn't know if it was day or night

I started kissin' everything in sight

But when i kissed a cop on the thirty-four an'vine

He broke my little bottle of

Love potion number nine
