Teach Me How to Shimmy


Mama you taught me how to do the bop

You taught me how to boogie real slow - yeah

You taught me how to twist and you taught me how to slop

Mama teach me one thing more



Come on and teach me how to shimmy

Like you and daddy do (come on get it, come on get it)

Teach me how to shimmy - huh huh

So I can shimmy too (come on get it)



Mama there's gonna be a dance tonight

You gotta teach me the ball creep - yeah

And Mama if I can't do it right

You know Gerry's gonna steal my guy



Come on and teach me how to shimmy

Like you and daddy do (come on get it, come on get it)

Teach me how to shimmy - huh huh

So I can shimmy too (come on get it)



I can hully gully good as Gerry can

But Mama hully gully ain't win it

My little boy he loves that we gonna cheat

And there's only one thing - gonna get it now



And teach me how to shimmy

Like you and daddy do (come on get it, come on get it)

Teach me how to shimmy - woh oh

So I can shimmy too (come on get it)



Shimmy

Like you and daddy do (come on get it, come on get it)

Teach me how to shimmy

Like you and daddy do (come on get it, come on get it)

Teach me how to shimmy

Like you and daddy do (come on get it, come on get it)

Teach me how to shimmy - woh oh

So I can shimmy too
