Ain't It Romantic?


Verse



KAY:

LisTen to a dream -

Came to me

With a lovely theme,

As you'll see;

Made me very happy;

In it was as a chappie

Who was handsome as could be.

Girls along the way

Used to sigh;

But he wouldn't play -

He's pass them by.

Their glances all were futile;

Love he never knew till

One fine day I caught his eye.



lst Refrain



I met him and he met me-

Oh gosh, oh gee!



SHORTY:

Ain't it romantic?



KAY:

He was shy and so was I,

Oh me, oh my!



SHORTY:

Ain't it romantic?



KAY:

I began to blush,

He began to flush.

All the noisy world was a-hush.

Then he grabbed me. Oh, what charms

Were in his arms!



SHORTY:

Ain't it romantic?



KAY:

Very soon the month of June -

A wedding tune -



SHORTY:

Ain't it romancic?



KAY:

Then a little cottage fair -

Everything so lovely there!

But my castles went up in smoke

At the moment that I awoke.

I was nearly frantic -



SHORTY:

Yes, but ain't it romancic, dear?



2nd Refrain



POLICEMAN:

Oh, how happy we shall be!



MAID:

Oh gosh, oh gee! Ain't it romancic?



POLICEMAN:

We'll be wealthy, too, says I.



MAID:

Oh me, oh my! Ain't it romantic?



POLICEMAN:

You shall be a queen

Whose like was never seen.



MAID:

Can I have a sewing machine?



POLICEMAN:

You'll be through with broom and sink,

And you'll wear mink.



MAID:

Ain't it romantic?



POLICEMAN:

Lots of pinkish underthings

And di'mond rings -



MAID:

Ain't it romantic?



POLICEMAN:

Then we'll have a private yacht

Seven castles and what not -



[He disappears]



MAID:

But my castles went up in smoke

At the moment that I awoke.

I was nearly frantic -

Oh, but ain't it romantic, dear?
