Someone to Watch over Me


Verse



KAY:

There's a saying old

Says that love is blind.

Still we're often told

"Seek and ye shall find."

So I'm going to seek a cenain lad I've had in mind.

Looking ev'rywhere,

Haven't found him yet;

He's the big affair I cannot forget -

Only man I ever think of with regret.

I'd like to add his initial to my monogram.

Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?





Refrain



There's a somebody I'm longing to see:

I hope that he

Turns out to be

Someone who'll watch over me.

I'm a littLe lamb who's lost in the wood;

I know I could

Always be good

To one who'll watch over me.

Although he may not be the man some

Girls think of as handsome,

To my heart he carries the key

Don't you tell him, please, to put on some speed,

Follow my lead? Oh, how I need

Someone to watch over me.
