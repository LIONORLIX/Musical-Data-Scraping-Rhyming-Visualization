Woman's Touch


GIRLS:

Oh, my goodness! What a mess this place is!

Dust upon our faces!

It needs a woman's touch.

Oh! The atmosphere is sad and ghostly.

What is needed mostly

Is the woman's touch.

What a sight this room is!

Show me where the broom is!

Find a can of Gold Dust

And we'll chase the old dust.

Plain to see it needs the woman's touch.

Jimmy's coming, so we want to clean up,

Brighten all the scene up

With the woman's touch.

Color, charm, and such

Need the woman's touch.



Whoop it up! Tonight is the night!

For dear old Jimmy's coming home!

Jimmy's coming home!



We must get

Ev'rything all set

For tonight, there's a party!



Shout "Hey! hey!"

Throw your cares away -

For tonight there's a party!

But work must be done

By ev'ry one -

Clear the floor!

For Jimmy's a pal

That ev'ry girl

Must adore!

And so we'll get

Ev'rything all set

By the time that Jim gets home.
