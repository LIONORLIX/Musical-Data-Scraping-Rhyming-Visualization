Fidgety Feet


Verse



POTTER:

Somethlng is the matter with me.

Oh, but it's chronic!



PHIL:

Do you need a tonic?



POTTER:

Oh, can't you see

A dumb thing is the matter with me.

I'm in condition -

I need no physician.



PHIL:

What can it be?



POTTER:

You can help me out.



PHIL:

What's it all about?



Refrain



POTTER:

I've got fidgety feet, fidgety feet, fidgety feet!

Oh, what fidgety feet, fidgety feet, fidgety feet!

Say, mate, come and be my sway mate;

How can anyone resist that rhythmical beat?

You will never go wrong, never go wrong, never go wrong

If you toddle along, toddle along, toddle along.

All I need's a partner to make my life complete -

Two more fidgety, fidgety feet.
