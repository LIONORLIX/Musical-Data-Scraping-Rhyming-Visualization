Don't Ask


Verse 1



POTTER:

If you're looking for a playmate,

There's a chap whose praises I'd sing.

You will find that he's a gay mate,

If you care for that sort of thing.

You'll be feeling dizzy when you've kissed him,

And you'll murmur, "Oh, is this a system!"





Refrain 1



Who is the guy -

Oh me, oh my -

Thinks you're peaches and pie...

Don't ask!

Who is the chap?

Who is the sap?

Love all over his map?

Don't ask!

Moon and stars, stars and moon, heaven above -

Lady, lady, someone's in love. Oh!

Who is the sheik

Who'd make you weak

With his parlor technique?

Don't ask!



Verse 2



PHIL:

Are you sure he won't mislead us?



POTTER:

Maybe it'll pay to take a chance.



DOLLY:

Is satisfaction guaranteed us?



POTTER:

You can count on that in advance.

He's the sort of chap to set your cap for.

He's the kind of bird the flappers flap for.



Refrain 2



Who is the miss

Who'd like a kiss?



GIRLS:

If you have to know this,

Don't ask!



POTTER:

Is there a Jill

Who'd like a thrill?



GIRLS:

Be yourself? Don't be sil'!

Don't ask!

But, oh my, she is shy, what'll she do?

Laddie, laddie, it's up to you.



POTTER:

Say, no use to sigh;

Come on and try.



GIRLS:

But will he satisfy?



ALL:

Don't ask!
