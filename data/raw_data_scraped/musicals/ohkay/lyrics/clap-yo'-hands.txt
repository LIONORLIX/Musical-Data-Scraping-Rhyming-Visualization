Clap Yo' Hands


Verse



POTTER:

Come on, you children, gather around -

Gather around, you children.

And we will lose that evil spirit

Called the voodoo.

Nothin' but trouble, if he has found,



If he has found you, children -

But you can chase the hoodoo

With the dance that you do.

Let me lead the way.

Jubilee today!

He'll never hound you;

Stamp on the ground, you children!

Come on!



Refrain



Clap-a yo' hand! Slap-a yo' thigh!

Halleluyah! Halleluyah!

Ev'rybody come along and join the Jubilee!

Clap-a yo' hand! Slap-a yo' thigh!

Don t you lose time! Don't you lose time!

Come along-it's shake yo' shoes time

Now for you and me!

On the sands of time

You are only a pebble;

Remember, trouble must be treated

Just like a rebel;

Send him to the Debble!

Clap-a yo' hand! Slap-a yo' thigh!

Halleluyah! Halleluyah!

Everybody come along and join the Jubilee!
