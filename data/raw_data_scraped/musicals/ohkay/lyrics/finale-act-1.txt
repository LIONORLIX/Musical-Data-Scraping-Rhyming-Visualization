Finale Act 1


GIRLS:

Oh it's perfectly grand!

He's won her heart and her hand.

Don't they make a lovely pair?

Our best wishes to you -

Take our blessing, Oh do!

Lots of happiness we hope you'll share.



ENSEMBLE:

Yes, we heard a noise like someone softly creeping.



JIMMY:

If you heard a noise, it's just my butler sweeping.



ENSEMBLE:

There was a noise like someone creeping

But he says it's just his butler sweeping.



ENSEMBLE:

Yes, yes, who can it be?

This looks funny to me.

It is odd, you must agree.



KAY:

Did you call, sir?



JIMMY:

Ah, Jane-my maid.

It was Jane.



KAY:

Yes, sir.



ENSEMBLE:

What a pretty maid!



JIMMY:

Simply Jane -



KAY:

Yes, sir -



ENSEMBLE:

What a pretty maid!

Now the myst'ry we can explain -

It was Jane - merely Jane.



ENSEMBLE:

Isn't it grand! Clap-a yo' hand!

Halleluyah! Halleluyah!

Ev'rybody's feeling gay-it's Jimmy's wedding day.

Isn't it grand! Clap-a yo' hand!

Halleluyah! Halleluyah!

Now we'll hear them vow to love and honor and obey!

Bachelor days and ways for our Jimmy are ended;

And if the bachelor days and ways of Jimmy are mended -

Ev'rything is splendid!



KAY:

Although he may not be the man some

Girls think of as handsome,

To my heart he carries the key.

Won't you tell him, please, to put on some speed,

Follow my lead? Oh, how I need

Someone to watch over me.
