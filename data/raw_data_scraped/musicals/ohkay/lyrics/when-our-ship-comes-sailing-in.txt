When Our Ship Comes Sailing In


1st Verse

DUKE:

We stand watching the horizon,

Casting anxious eager eyes on

All the little ships as they go passing by.



POTTER:

How we're hoping, how we're yearning,

For a safe and sound returning.

Are we soon to see our ship against the sky?



SHORTY:

Anyone who's ever waited on a pier

Will appreciate our feeling here.



ALL:

What a tender welcome we will give our friends

As their journey ends.



1st Refrain



When our ship comes sailing in-

We will shout our joy

With a "Ship ahoy!"

Then our glad days will begin

When we start unloading the gin.



DUKE:

Our guilty conscience we will try to smother;



SHORTY:

We'll hail each Prohibitionist a brocher,



POTTER:

And sell a dozen cases to his mother!



ALL:

When our ship comes sailing in -

Full of Haig and Haig and gin!



2nd Verse



DUKE:

Just imagine our position,

Think of all the competition

That we've got along the whole Atlancic shore.



SHORTY:

From Southhampton to Miami,

Coast patrols of Uncle Sammy

On our business are declaring open war.



POTTER:

You would think that what we're doing was a crime -

Helping you to have a decent time.

Congressmen and Senators kick up a fuss -

Then they buy from us!



2nd refrain



When our ship comes sailing in -



DUKE:

When our ship of dreams

Through the harbor steams,



ALL:

Then our glad days will begin



POTTER:

Mr. Volstead, pardon our sin.



DUKE:

There's champagne in our cargo that will please ya!



POTTER:

Just give your girl a case and she will squeeze ya!



SHORTY:

(She needn't know we mixed it wich magnesia!)



ALL:

When our ship comes sailing in -

Full of Haig and Haig and gin!



3rd Refrain



When our ship comes sailing in -



DUKE:

Ev'ry worry gone -

How we'll carry on!



ALL

Boy! It's great when dreams come true



DUKE:

And you see your ship on the blue.

But, oh, the risk! It's paining us to tell of it!



SHORTY:

The money that we get is not all vel-e-vet;



POTTER:

The cops take all our profits - that's the hell of it.



ALL:

When our ship comes sailing in -

Full of Haig and Haig and gin!
