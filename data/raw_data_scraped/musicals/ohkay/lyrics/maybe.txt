Maybe


1st Verse



KAY:

Though today is a blue day,

Still tomorrow is near;

And perhaps with the new day,

Cares will all disappear.

Though happiness is late,

And we must wait,

There's no need to be nervous,

There are dreams at your service.



1st Refrain



Soon or late-maybe,

If you wait-maybe,

Some kind fate-maybe,

Will help you discover

Where to find your lover.

You will hear "You-hoo."

She'll be near you-oo.

Paradise will open its gate -

Maybe soon-maybe late.
