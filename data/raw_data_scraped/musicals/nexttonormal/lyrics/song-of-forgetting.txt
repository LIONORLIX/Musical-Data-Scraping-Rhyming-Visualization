Song of Forgetting


DAN (spoken)

You don't remember any of this?



DIANA (spoken)

I should, right?



DAN

This house and all these rooms

Last Christmas or last year

Out back the dogwood blooms



DIANA

Do I really live here?



DAN

The paint, the walls

All this glass and wood

You don't recall?



DIANA

How I wish I could



DAN

Our house on Walton Way

The house with the red door

Our trip to San Tropez

The whole week a downpour



NATALIE

My first few steps, and my first lost tooth

What nothing yet?



DIANA

Well to tell the truth



NATALIE (spoken)

Jesus.



DAN

Sing a song of forgetting

A song of the way things were not

Sing of what's lost to you

Of time that you never knew

Sing of not remembering when

Of memories that go unremembered and then

Sing a song of forgetting, again



That day our child was born

Our baby girl's first cry

That gray and drizzly morn

I've never felt so high



DIANA

The day we met

And we shared 2 beers



DAN

Then?



DIANA

I forget.



DAN

But that's 19 years



DIANA (spoken)

That Dr. Mitchell said there might be some memory loss.



DAN (spoken)

Dr. Madden.



DIANA (spoken)

Well, see, there you go.



NATALIE

What a lovely cure

It's a medical miracle

With a mind so pure

That she doesn't know anything



DAN

It's there I'm sure

Cause memories don't die.



NATALIE

Why



DAN

They don't die



NATALIE

They die



DIANA

I'll try



(overlapping)

DAN

Sing a song of forgetting

A song of the way things were not

Sing of what's lost to you

Of times that you never knew



(overlapping)

NATALIE

Sing a song of forgetting

A song of the way things were not

Sing of what's lost to you

What's lost to you

What's lost to you

You never knew



(overlapping)

DIANA

Sing a song of forgetting

A song of the way things were not

Sing of what's lost to you

What's lost to you

What's lost to you

You never knew



ALL

Sing of not remembering when

Of memories that go unremembered and when



DAN

Sing a song of forgetting



NATALIE

Sing a song of forgetting



DIANA

Sing a song of forgetting



ALL

Again
