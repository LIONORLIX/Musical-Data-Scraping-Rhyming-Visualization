I'm Alive (reprise)


I am more than memory

I am what might be I am mystery

Come closer

Come closer



I am old as time

I'm forever young

I am every song that will stay unsung I'll find you

Remind you



Until you name me

you can't tame me

This is one old game

I can play so well



I'm alive I'm alive

I am so alive

And the medicines failed

And the doctors lied



I'm alive I'm alive

I am death defied



I'm alive

So alive



I'm alive



I'm alive



I'm alive
