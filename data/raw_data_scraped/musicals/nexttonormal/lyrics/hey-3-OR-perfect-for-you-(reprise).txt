Hey 3 / Perfect for You (Reprise)


HENRY

Hey



NATALIE

Hey



HENRY

You look like a star

A vision in blue



NATALIE

Oh I do?



HENRY

And you are

Hey, you came



NATALIE

Well I said that I might



HENRY

I thought we were through

Me and you



NATALIE

Not tonight



HENRY

Will you mom be ok?



NATALIE

Well she might be some day.



HENRY

But for now it's all fine?



NATALIE

She's still on my mind.



HENRY

Can you leave it behind?



NATALIE

Hey, hey



HENRY

Stay, let's see this thing through



NATALIE

Am I crazy?

I might end up crazy



HENRY

I'll be here for you



NATALIE

You say that right here

But then give it a year

Or 10 years or a life

And I could end up your wife

Sitting staring at walls

Throwing shit down the stairs

Freaking out at the store

Running nude down the street

Bleeding out in the bath



HENRY

Perfect for you

I will be perfect for you

So you could go crazy

Or I could go crazy, it's true

Sometimes life isn't sane

But crazy I know I can do

Cause crazy is perfect

And fucked up is perfect

So I will be perfect



NATALIE

Perfect



BOTH

Perfect for you
