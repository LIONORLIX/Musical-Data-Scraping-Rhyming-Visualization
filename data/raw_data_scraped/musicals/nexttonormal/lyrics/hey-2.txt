Hey 2


Henry:

Hey



Natalie:

Hey



Henry:

So tomorrow's the dance,

It's annoying I know

But let's go.



Natalie:

Not a chance.



Henry:

Let me know you again.



Natalie:

Not right now.



Henry:

Ok, when?

Say wait and I'll wait.



(overlapping)

Natalie:

It's already too late.

Hey, hey!

Will you listen?

Just shut up and listen.



Henry:

There's no way it's too late.

There's no way

I stayed by your side.



Why do I get denied?



Natalie:

You remind me of me.

And how fucked up I can be.



Henry:

Ok, hey.

Let's start over, clean slate.

I'll come by here at 8.

If you show then we'll go.

If you don't, well we'll see.



Natalie:

You just don't give up.



Henry:

So don't give up on me.



Natalie:

Goodbye, Henry.
