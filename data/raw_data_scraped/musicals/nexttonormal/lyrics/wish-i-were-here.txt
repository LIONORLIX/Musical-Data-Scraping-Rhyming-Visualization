Wish I Were Here


Diana:

In an instant lightning flashes and the burst might leave me blind.

When the bolt of lightning crashes and it burns right through my mind,

It's like someone drained my brain out, set my frozen mind to thaw,

Let the lethargy and pain out, while I stood and watched in awe.



Natalie:

I am riding on the brightest buzz.

I am worlds away from who I was.

And they told me it would change me,

Though they don't know how it does.

Cast (background vocals):

No they don't know how it does.



Diana:

I have lived a life of clouds and gray,

But this is crystal clear.

Wish I were here.

Cast (background vocals):

Wish I were here.

Diana:

I imagine it's remarkable,

Exuberant, austere.

Wish I were here.

Cast (background vocals):

Wish I were here.

Diana:

Wish I were here.

Cast (background vocals):

Wish I were here



Natalie:

It's euphoria, it's anger,

It's the winter wind, it's fire.

Cast (background vocals):

It's the winter wind, it's fire.

Natalie:

And it kills my deepest hunger as it fills me with desire.

I'm the light and heat of every sun.

Diana:

I'm the light and heat of every sun.

Natalie:

I'm a bullet from a magic gun.

Diana:

I'm a bullet from a magic gun.

Natalie:

And I'm trying to enjoy it,

Diana and Natalie:

But I'm missing all the fun.

Cast (background vocals):

I am missing all the fun.



Diana and Natalie:

Am i feeling what I think I'm feeling;

The hope, the heat, the fear?

Wish I were here.

Cast (background vocals):

Wish I were here.

Diana and Natalie:

Is this someone else's head trick?

Do I just disappear?

Wish I were here.

Cast (background vocals):

Wish I were here.

Diana and Natalie:

Wish I were here.

Cast (background vocals):

Wish I were... here.



Diana and Natalie:

Plug me in and turn me on,

And flip the switch, I'm good as gone.

It slits my skin, and trips my brain

And feel the burn, when I don't feel the pain.



Is my brain reborn or is it wrecked,

In freedom or in fear?

Wish I were here.

Cast (background vocals):

Wish I were...



Diana and Natalie:

Have I blown my mind forever?

Is cloudy my new clear?

Wish I were here.

Cast (background vocals):

Wish I were here.

Diana and Natalie:

Wish I were here.

Wish I were...



Natalie:

Can I hide my stupid hunger,

Fake some confidence and cheer,

'Wish I were here'?

Wish I were here.
