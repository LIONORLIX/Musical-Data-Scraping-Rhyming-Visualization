Perfect for You


HENRY

Our planet is poison, the oceans the air

Around and beneath and above you



NATALIE

Um Henry that's true and I totally care



HENRY

I'm trying to tell you I love you

The world is at war

Filled with death and disease

We dance on the edge of destruction

The globe's getting warmer by deadly degrees



NATALIE

And this is one fucked up seduction



HENRY

This planet is pretty much broken beyond all repair

But one thing is working if you're standing there

Perfect for you, I could be perfect for you

I might be lazy, a loner, a bit of a stoner it's true

But I could be perfect for you, perfect for you



Airplanes are falling from quiet blue skies



NATLIE

My schedule's a total disaster



HENRY

The world shuts its ears when a starving child cries



NATALIE

We'd sink like Titanic but faster



GABE

Tsunamis and hurricanes crash on the beach



NATALIE

You'll crash even worse if you date me



HENRY

And peace somehow always stays out of our reach



NATALIE

I'll freak and we'll fight and you'll hate me



HENRY

This world may get more and more messed up with each passing year

But we can be flawless, just you and me here

Perfect for you, just let me be perfect for you

We're both slightly crazy

But you, you amaze me, you do

I'll make my self perfect, perfect for you.

You square all the corners

I straighten the curves



NATALIE

You've got some nerve Henry

And I've just all Nerves



HENRY

But even if everything else turns to dirt



BOTH

We can be the one thing in this world that wont hurt



HENRY

I can't fix what's fucked up

But one thing I know I can do

I can be perfect for you



NATALIE

I can be perfect for you.



BOTH

Perfect for you.



(spoken)

HENRY

Nice house, can I come in?



NATALIE

Oh no.



HENRY

Ok.



GABE

Are you spying on your own daughter?



DIANA

When did she get a boyfriend?  How did I miss this?



GABE

Well you kinda miss a lot.



DIANA

Do you think they're in love?



GABE

Who knows?  They're young.  They're horny.  It happens.



DAN

Marry me!



DIANA

What?



DAN

Marry me!  Let's have a family.  I know, we're too young.

But we're not, I'm almost 23.

And how do you know this isn't a sign saying, we belong together.



DIANA

How do you know it's not a sign saying get new rubbers?



DAN

Because I know its not.  I love you, and this baby.



DIANA

Dan,



and NATALIE

This is crazy.
