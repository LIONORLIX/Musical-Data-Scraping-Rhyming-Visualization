A Light in the Dark


DAN

One light shines in the drive

One single sign that our house is alive

Our house, our own

So why do I love there alone

Tell me why I wait through the night

And why do I leave on the light

You know, I know

Our house was a home long ago



Take this chance cause it may be our last

To be free, to let go of the past

And to try each as lover or friend

To let love never die if it does we'll pretend

Take my hand and let me take your heart

Keep you far from what keeps us apart

Let us start with a light in the dark



Night falls I stare at the walls



DIANA

I stare at these walls



DAN

I wake and wander the halls



DIANA

I get lost in these halls



DAN

And I ache to the bone



DIANA

It's like nothing I've known



BOTH

I can't get through this alone.



DAN

Take this chance and we'll make a new start

Somewhere far from what keeps us apart

And I swear that somewhere in the night

There's a light, a light in the dark
