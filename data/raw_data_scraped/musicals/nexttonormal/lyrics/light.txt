Light


Natalie:

We need some light.

First of all, we need some light.

You can't sit here in the dark.

And all alone, it's a sorry sight.

It's just you and me.

We'll live, you'll see.



Dan:

Night after night,

We'd sit and wait for the morning light.

But we've waited far too long,

For all that's wrong to be made right.



Diana:

Day after day,

Wishing all our cares away.

Trying to fight the things we feel,

But some hurts never heal.

Some ghost are never gone,

But we go on,

We still go on.



And you find some way to survive

And you find out you don't have to be happy at all,

To be happy you're alive.



Natalie:

Day after day,

Give me clouds, and rain and gray.

Give me pain, if that's what's real.



Henry and Natalie:

It's the price we pay to feel.



Dan and Diana:

The price of love is loss,



Dan:

But still we pay.



Dan and Henry:

We love anyway.



Gabe:

And when the night has finally gone.

And when we see the new day dawn.

We'll wonder how we wandered for so long, so blind.

The wasted world we thought we knew,

The light will make it look brand new.

So



All:

Let it

Let it

Let it

Let it

Let it

Shine, shine, shine.



Day after day (day after day),

We'll find the will to find our way.

Knowing that the darkest skies will someday see the sun.



Dan:

When our long night is done,



Dan and Natalie:

There will be light.



Diana:

(There will be light.

There will be light.)



All:

There will be light.

When we open up our light.

Sons and daughters, husbands, wives.

Can fight that fight.

There will be light.

There will be light.

There will be light.

There will be light.
