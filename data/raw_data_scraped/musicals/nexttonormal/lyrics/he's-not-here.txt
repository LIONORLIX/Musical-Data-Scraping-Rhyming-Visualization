He's Not Here


(spoken)

HENRY

I didn't know you had a brother.



NATALIE

I don't.  He died before I was born.



DIANA

What?  What is it?



(sung)

DAN

He's not here

He's not here

Love, I know you know

Do you feel he's still real?

Love, it's just not so

Why is it you still believe?

Do you dream or do you grieve?

You've got to let him go

He's been dead 16 years

No my love he's not here.



(spoken)

NATALIE

This is fucked.



DAN

Language!



NATALIE

Fuck this.



HENRY

It was wonderful to meet you both.



DAN

What about the new meds?



DIANA

We have the happiest septic tank on the block.



DAN

You Jesus Di.  They were working.



DIANA

They weren't really.



DAN

We'll get a new round.  We'll call Dr. Fine.



DIANA

No!



DAN

Diana, look, I know.
