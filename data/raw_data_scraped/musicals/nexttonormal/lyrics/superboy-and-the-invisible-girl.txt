Superboy and the Invisible Girl


NATALIE

Superboy and the Invisible Girl

Son of Steel and Daughter of Air

He's a hero, a lover, a prince

She's not there



Superboy and the Invisible Girl

Everything a kid oughtta be

He's immortal, forever alive

Then there's me



I wish I could fly

And magically appear and disappear

I wish I could fly

I'd fly far away from here



Superboy and the Invisible Girl

He's the one you wish would appear

He's your hero, forever your son

He's not here

I am here



DIANA

You know that's not true

You're our little pride and joy, our perfect plan

You know I love you

I love you as much as I can



NATALIE

Take a look at the Invisible Girl

Here she is, clear as the day

Please look closely and find her before she fades away



NATALIE and GABE

Superboy and the Invisible Girl

Son of Steel and Daughter of Air

He's a hero, a lover, a prince

She's not there

She's not there

She's not there

She's not there
