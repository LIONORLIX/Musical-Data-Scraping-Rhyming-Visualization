We should call Dr. Madden.



DIANA (spoken)

I don't want to call Dr. Madden.  I want to make sense of this.

I don't ever remember hearing you say his name, what was his name?



DAN (spoken)

Diana.



DIANA (spoken)

What was his name?  Please, tell me his name.



DAN

It's gonna be fine, it's gonna be fine.

We'll go back to the Doctor's 'cause we caught it just in time.

We'll take the pills, we'll pay the bills, we'll do more ECT.

DAN

It's gonna be good, you'll see.

What was his name?



DAN

It's gonna be good, you'll see.
