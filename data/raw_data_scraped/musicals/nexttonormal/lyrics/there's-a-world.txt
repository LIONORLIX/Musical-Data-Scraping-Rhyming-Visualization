There's a World


GABE

There's a world, there's a world I know

A place we can go where the pain will go away

There's a world where the sun shines each day

There's a world, there's a world out there

I'll show you just where

And in time I know you'll see

There's a world where we can be free

Come with me



DR. MADDEN (spoken)
