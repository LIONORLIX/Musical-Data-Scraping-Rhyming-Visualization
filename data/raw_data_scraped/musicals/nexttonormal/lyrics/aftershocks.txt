Aftershocks


GABE

They've managed to get rid of me, returned me to the grave

ECT, electric chair, we shock who we can't save

They've cleared you of my memory and many more as well

You may have wanted some of them but who can ever tell

Your brainwaves are more regular, the chemistry more pure

The headaches and the nausea will pass and you'll endure

You son is gone forever though, of that the doctor's sure

The memories will wane, the aftershocks remain

You wonder which is worse, the symptom or the cure



DAN (spoken)

Diana, honey, you've been at this for days.



DIANA (spoken)

There's something missing Dan.  It's like its tugging at me.  I can almost see it.



DAN (spoken)

Come to bed.  If the memories and meant to come back, they will.



HENRY (spoken)

Oh, sorry Ms. Goodman.  I just need to talk to Natalie about some homework.

I know it's late and she's not answering her is everything alright?



DIANA (spoken)

Henry



HENRY (spoken)

Yes?



DIANA (spoken)

You remind me of someone.  How old are you?



HENRY (spoken)

Seventeen.  Why?



DIANA (spoken)

I don't know.  Natalie's in her room.



GABE

They've managed to get rid of me.  I'm gone without a trace

But sear the soul and leave scar no treatment can erase

They've cut away the cancer but forgot to fill the hole

They moved me from your memory, I'm still there in your soul

Your life goes back to normal now, or so they all believe

Your heart is in your chest again, not hanging from your sleeve

They've driven out the demons and they've earned you this reprieve

The memories are gone.  The aftershocks live on

But with nothing to remember, is there nothing left to grieve?



DIANA

With nothing to remember



HENRY

Hey



NATALIE

Hey



HENRY

So tomorrow's the dance

It's annoying I know

But let's go



NATALIE

Not a chance



HENRY

Let me know you again



NATALIE

Not right now



HENRY

Ok when?  Say wait and I'll wait



NATALIE

It's already too late



HENRY

There's no way it's too late



NATALIE

Hey, hey



HENRY

There's no way, I'll stay by your side



NATALIE

Henry listen, just shut up and listen.



HENRY

Why do I get denied?



NATALIE

You remind me of me, and how fucked up I can be.



HENRY

Ok, hey, let's start over clean slate

I'll come by here at 8

If you show

Then we'll go

If you don't, well we'll see



NATALIE

You just don't give up



HENRY

So don't give up on me



NATALIE

Goodbye Henry



DIANA

It's been four weeks since the treatment

And my mind is still a mess

And what's left to be remembered

Well it's anybody's guess

Cause my past is like the weather

It will come and it will go

I don't know, even know

What it is that I don't know

I'm some Christopher Columbus

Sailing out into my mind

With no map of where I'm going

Or of what I've left behind



I don't the things I don't know

I'm sure something's missing

I wish it would show

I don't know, you say take it slow

I do, but how I do, I don't know



DR. MADDEN

Are you talking with your husband?



DIANA

Well he hasn't much to say



DR. MADDEN

Is helping you remember?



DIANA

I remember that's his way



DR. MADDEN

Does the puzzle come together

Piece my piece and row by row?



DIANA

I don't know, I don't know

Where the fucking pieces go

Cause I don't how this started

So I won't know when it's done



DR. MADDEN

Have you talked of your depression

Your delusions and your son?



DIANA (spoken)

My what?



DR. MADDEN (spoken)

I think you and your husband should talk more.



DIANA (spoken)

We should talk more?  That's it?

I don't even remember marrying this man, its not like I'm not some

sexually frustrated soccer mom.



DR. MADDEN (spoken)

Interestingly, the underlying challenges are similar.  I'll see you next time.



DIANA (spoken)

But
