You Don't Know


DIANA (spoken)

You know, really?

What exactly do you know?



DAN (spoken)

I know you're hurting. I am, too.



DIANA

Do you wake up in the morning and need help to lift your head?

Do you read obituaries and feel jealous of the dead?

It's like living on a cliffside not knowing when you'll dive.

Do you know, do you know what it's like to die alive?



When the world that once had color fades to white and gray and black.

When tomorrow terrifies you, but you'll die if you look back.

You don't know.

I know you don't know.

You say that you're hurting, it sure doesn't show.

You don't know.

It lays me so low. When you say let go, and I say you don't know.

The sensation that you're screaming, but you never make a sound.

Or the feeling that you're falling, but you never hit the ground.

It just keeps on rushing at you day by day by day by day.

You don't know, you don't know what it's like to live that way.

Like a refugee, a fugitive, forever on the run.

If it gets me it will kill me, but I don't know what I've done.
