I Dreamed A Dance


DIANA

I saw you light the ballroom

With your sparkling eyes so blue

Graceful as an angel's wing

I dreamed a dance with you



You whispered slyly, softly

You told me you would be true

We spun around a thousand stars

I dreamed a dance with you



I know the night is dying dear

I know the day will dawn



Both

The dancers may disappear

Still the dance goes on



Gabe

And on



DIANA

I'll wake alone tomorrow

The dream of our dance is through

But now until forever love

I'll live to dance with you

I'll dream my love

I'll live my love

And I'll die to dance
