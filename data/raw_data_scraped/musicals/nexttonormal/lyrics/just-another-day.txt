Just Another Day


DIANA

They're the perfect loving family, so adoring

And I love them every day of every week

So my son's a little shit, my husband's boring

And my daughter, though a genius, is a freak

Still I help them love each other

Father mother sister brother

Cheek to cheek



(spoken)

DIANA

Natalie, it's 4 in the morning, is everything ok?



NATALIE

Everything's great, why wouldn't it be great? It's great!



DIANA

Honey you need to slow down. Take some time for yourself.

I'm going to have sex with your father.



NATALIE

Great, thanks, I'm so glad I know that.



(sung)

NATALIE

So it's times like these I wonder how I take it,

And if other families live the way we do.

If they love each other or if they just fake it,

And if other daughters feel like I feel too.

Cause some days I think I'm dying,

But I'm really only trying to get through



GABE

For just another day, for another stolen hour

When the world will feel my power and obey



BOTH

It's just another day



GABE

Feeling like I'll live forever



NATALIE

Feeling like this feeling never goes away



BOTH

For just another day.



DAN

When it's up to you to hold your house together

A house you built with patience and with care

But you're grappling with that gray and rainy weather

And you're living on a latte and a prayer



DIANA

Prayer



BOTH

Can you keep the cup from tipping

Can you keep your grip from slipping in despair,

For just another day



DAN and GABE

In the hustle and the hurry



DAN

You want to wipe you worry clean away



ALL

For just another day.



DIANA

I will keep the plates all spinning



DIANA and NATALIE

With a smile so white and winning all the way



ALL

Cause what doesn't kill me doesn't kill me

So fill me up for just another day.



DIANA

It only hurts when I breathe.



DAN

It only hurts when I try.



GABE

It only hurts when I think.



NATALIE

It only hurts when I cry.



DAN

It only hurts when I work.



GABE

It only hurts when I play.



NATALIE

It only hurts when I move.



ALL

It only hurts when I say,

It's just another day



(overlapping)

DIANA

A dizzy, dizzy day



GABE

When the morning sun is showing



DIANA

I will hold it all together



ALL

And you wish that you were running far away



DIANA

I will hide the nest away



ALL

It's just another day



DIANA

I will survive another day



GABE

Birds are singing, figs are falling



DIANA

And I will pray to hold on just this day



ALL

And you wish you would be gone

But you'll stay

You'll stay



DIANA

For my family's sake



ALL

For you know it's now or never



DIANA

I'll reap what I can take



ALL

And you know they're gone forever



DAN

Stay



DIANA

I'm only just awake

Every day is just another and another and another

I will hold it all together

We're the perfect loving family

If they say we're not then fuck 'em

The perfect loving family

I will keep the plates all spinning

And the world just keeps on spinning



(spoken)

DIANA

I think the house is spinning.
