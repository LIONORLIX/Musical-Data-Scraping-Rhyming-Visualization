I've Been


Dan:

Standing in this room,

Well I wonder what comes now.

I know I have to help her,

But hell if I know how.

And all the times that I've been told

The way her illness goes.

The truth of it is no one really knows.

And every day this act we act gets more and more absurd.

And all my fears just sit inside me, screaming to be heard.

I know they won't, though, not a single word.

I was here at her side

When she called, when she cried.

How could she leave me on my own?

Will it work, this cure?

There's no way to be sure.

But I'm weary to the bone

And whenever she goes flying

I keep my feet right on the ground.

Oh now I need a lift

And there's no one around.



Hey!



Gabe:

Hey!



Dan and Gabe:

Ohhh



(Together)

Dan:

Ahhh oooh

No



Gabe:

Ahh oooh

No



Dan:

And I've never had to face the world without her at my side.

Now I'm strolling right beside her as the black hole opens wide.

Mine is just a slower suicide.

I've been here for the show,

Every high, every low.

But it's the worst we've ever known.

She's been hurt and how?

But I can't give up now.

'Cause I've never been alone.

I could never be alone.
