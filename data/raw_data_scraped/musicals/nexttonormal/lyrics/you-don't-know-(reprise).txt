You Don't Know (Reprise)


DIANA

It’s been four weeks since the treatment

And my mind is still a mess

And what’s left of me remembered

Well, it’s anybody’s guess.

‘Cause my past is like the weather

It will come and it will go

I don’t know, even know

What it is that I don’t know



I’m some Christopher Columbus

Sailing out into my mind

With no map of where I’m going

Or of what I left behind



I don't know, the things I don't know.

I'm sure something's missing, I wish it would show

I don't know, you say take it slow,

And I do, although, how I do, I don't know!



DR. MADDEN:

Are you talking with your husband?



DIANA

Well, he hasn't much to say.



DR. MADDEN

Is it helping you remember?



DIANA

I remember that's his way.



DR. MADDEN

Does the puzzle come together piece by piece and row by row?



DIANA

I don't know, I don't know where the fucking pieces go!

'Cause I don't know how this started, so I won't know when it's done.



DR. MADDEN

Have you talked of your depression, your delusions, and your son?
