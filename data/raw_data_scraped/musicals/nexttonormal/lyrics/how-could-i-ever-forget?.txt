How Could I Ever Forget?


GABE (humming)



DAN (spoken)

What are you doing?



DIANA (spoken)

What is this?



DAN (spoken)

Where'd you get that? It's nothing, an old music box.



DIANA (spoken)

It's the first thing you gave me.



DAN (spoken)

Diana.



DIANA (spoken)

When I was pregnant.



DAN (spoken)

You, you don't need to.



DIANA (spoken)

The first time. The first time?



DAN (spoken)

Diana, you, you shouldn't.



DIANA

We were still living downtown



DAN (spoken)

You shouldn't.



DIANA

My black coat thrown over my blue nightgown

You drove too fast, the lights of the city flew past



DAN (spoken)

Please, don't.



DIANA

How could I ever forget?

Outside the morning was cool and wet

He had such chills but still

He lay there so still

Just 18 months old, so cold

We ran him inside

Lost, worrying, wondering

That hospital room, that gloom



(overlapping)

How could I ever forget?

Screaming at doctors

Alarmed, upset

They said too wait

They never said we were too late

But I was a child raising a child

Those weeks full of joy, then a moment of dread



DAN (overlapping)

How could I ever forget?

I was so upset

Diana don't

You think this will help but it won't

So many years ago

So much we could not know



DIANA

Someone simply said, Your child is



DAN

How could I ever forget?



DIANA

How could I ever forget?



DAN

This was



BOTH

the moment my life was set

That day that I lost you

It's clear as the day we met

How could I ever forget?



DAN (spoken)

Why would you want to remember the things that hurt you?



DIANA (spoken)

I want to remember everything Dan. How did he die? Why? Why?!



DAN (spoken)

Diana, we didn't know. He was sick. But even the doctors missed it.

We took him to the clinic, the specialist, the

ER in the middle of the night. They said he had food allergies.

They said babies cry. We stayed up every night.

You slept in his room but he cried and he cried.



DIANA (spoken)

Until one morning he stopped.



DAN (spoken)

That's enough.



DIANA (spoken)

He was a baby when he died, but I remember him much older.



DAN (spoken)

We should call Dr. Madden.
