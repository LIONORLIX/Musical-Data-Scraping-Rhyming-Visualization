I Am the One


DAN

Can you tell me what it is you're afraid of?

Can you tell me why i'm afraid it's me?

Can I touch you?

We've been fine for so long now

How could something go wrong that i can't see?

Cause I'm holding on

and I won't let go

I just thought you should know



I am the one who knows you

I am the one who cares

I am the one who's always been there

I am the one who's helped you

And if you think that I just don't give a damn

Then you just don't know who I am



Could you leave me



GABE

Hey dad, it's me.



DAN

Could you let me go under?



GABE

Why can't you see?



DAN

While you watch as I drown



BOTH

And wonder why



DAN

Are you bleeding?



GABE

Are you waiting? Are you wishing? Are you wanting all that she can't give?



DAN

Are you bruised? Are you broken?



GABE

Are you hurting? Are you healing? Are you hoping for life to live?



DAN

Does it help you to know,



BOTH

Well so am I



DAN

Tell me what to do.



GABE

Look at me.



DAN

Tell me who to be.



GABE

Look at me.



DAN

So I can see



BOTH

And you?ll see



DAN

I am the one who holds you



GABE

I am



DAN

I am the one who'll stay



GABE

I am



DAN

I am the one



DAN

Who won't walk away



GABE

I won't walk away



DAN

Yeah, yeah, yeah

I am the one who'll heal you



GABE

I am



DAN

And now you tell me that I won't give a damn



GABE

You do give a damn



DAN

But I know you know



BOTH

Who I am

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah



DAN

That's who



BOTH

I am

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah



DAN

That's who



BOTH

I am

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah





DAN

That's who I am

Cause I'm holding on



GABE

And I won't let go



BOTH

Yeah I thought you should know

I am the one who knows you

I am the one who cares

I am the one who's always been there

Yeah, yeah, yeah

I am the one who needs you

And if you think that I just don't give a damn,



DAN

Then you just don't know who I am



DIANA

You say you hurt like me

You say that you know

Oh, you don?t know

I know you don?t know

You say that you?re hurting

I know it ain?t so

You don?t know

Why don?t you just go?

?Cause it lays me low

And I?m saying



DIANA

You don?t know



DAN

Who I am



DIANA

You don?t know



DAN

Who I am



GABE

You just don?t know who I am
