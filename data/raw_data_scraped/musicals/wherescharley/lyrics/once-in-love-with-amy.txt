Once In Love With Amy


Once in love with Amy

Always in love with Amy

Ever and ever fascinated by her

Sets your heart on fire to stay.



Once you're kissed by Amy

Tear up your list it's Amy

Ply her with bonbons poetry and flowers

Moon a million hours away.



You might be quite the fickle hearted rover

So carefree and bold

Who loves a girl and later thinks it over

And just quits cold.



But once in love with Amy

Always in love with Amy

Ever and ever sweetly you'll romance her

Trouble is the answer will be

That Amy would rather stay in love with me.



You might be quite the fickle hearted rover

So carefree and bold

Who loves a girl and later thinks it over

And just quits cold.



But once in love with Amy

Always in love with Amy

Ever and ever sweetly you'll romance her

Trouble is the answer will be

That Amy would rather stay in love with me...
