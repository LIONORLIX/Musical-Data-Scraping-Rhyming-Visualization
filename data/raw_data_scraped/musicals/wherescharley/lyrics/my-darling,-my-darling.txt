My Darling, My Darling


My Darling, My Darling

Till a moment ago we were "Mister" and "Miss"

Discussing the weather,

Avoiding each other's eye.

Till a moment ago when we happened to kiss

And we kissed the "Mister" and "Miss" gooodbye.

Now at last I can sigh,



My darling, my darling,

I've wanted to call you "my darling"

For many and many a daay.

My darling, my darling,

I fluttered and fled like a starling;

My couurage just melted away.

Now all at once you've kissed me

And there's not a thing

I'm sane enough to say

Except, my darling, my darling,

Get used to that name of

"My darling" it's here to stay.
