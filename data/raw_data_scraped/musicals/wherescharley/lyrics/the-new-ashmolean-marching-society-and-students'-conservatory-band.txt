The New Ashmolean Marching Society And Students' Conservatory Band


Here they come with the sunlight on the trumpets,

Here they come with the banners flying high,

In my throat, I've a lumpy sort of feeling

And the bright gleam of pride is in my eye!

Here they come with the clarinets a-wailing,

Here they come rather quickly up the square,

And I know in a moment I'll be cheering

And my bright Sunday hat will be high in the air

For The New Ashmolean Marching Society

And Students' Conservatory Band!



Yes, the New Ashmolean

Could have beat Napoleon

With all those deadly instruments in hand!

There are those who favor

The philharmonic flavor,

But to me, the finest in the land

Is The New Ashmolean Marching Society

And Students' Conservatory Band!



Though they march only slightly out of tempo,

Though they play just a trifle out of tune,

Though there's just a suggestion in the oboe,

Of the sound of a hound beneath the moon (howwwll...)

Though the trombone's a little independent

And the drummer is not exactly choice,

Still the old college spirit is upon me,

And I shout every time at the top of my voice

For The New Ashmolean Marching Society

And Students' Conservatory Band!



If you're an*lytical,

Sensitive, or critical,

You'll like it more the farther back you stand ...

But for me, it's bully!

It satisfies me fully

When I hear the thunder, close at hand,

Of The New Ashmolean Marching Society

And Students' Conservatory Band!

Yes, The New Ashmolean Marching Society

And Students' Conservatory Band!
