The Woman In His Room


Charley's a nice boy

A dear boy,

A sweet boy,

A fine boy,

A good boy

Through and through.

Charley's a nice boy,

A sweet boy,

A fine boy,

A good boy,

So loyal and so true.

I am his one girl,

The one girl,

The one girl,

The one girl

No other can replace.

So when my Charley's far form me

I'm content as I can be

Just to close my eyes

And picture his face

And picture his face

And picture-picture!



That picture, That picture

That picture of that woman

That picture of that woman on the piano in his room.

That picture, That picture

That picture of that woman wearing tights

And a vulgar ostrich plume.

That woman, That woman

That hussy of a woman

That woman in the picture

That woman in his room!

Oh! The shock of it!

A woman in his room.



That woman, that woman

I wonder if he's kissed her

I wonder if he's kissed her



(spoken) Of course, of course

I'm such a fool



She's probably his sister

Just a photograph taken at a masquerade.

What a terrible, terrible mistake I've made.

Charley's a nice boy,

A dear boy,

A sweet boy,

A fine boy,

A good boy

Through and through

Charley's a nice boy,

A sweet boy,

A fine boy,

A good boy

So loyal and so true.

I am his one girl

The one girl

The one girl

The one girl no other can replace.



(spoken) No other.



No other living relative. That's exactly what he said

No other living relative except his aunt.

For all the rest are dead



(spoken) He has no sister! Then exactly who is



That woman, that woman

That woman in the picture

That woman in the picture on the piano in his room.

That woman, That woman

That woman who I have no doubt

Is drenched in a hideous French perfume.

That woman, That woman

That gaudy, bawdy Venus

That woman's come between us

That woman in his room

Oh! The gall of it.

A woman in his room.



That woman, that woman

For this he'll have to answer

For this he'll have to answer.



(spoken) Oh, why am I so suspicious.



She's probably some dancer.

Just a lady my Charley doesn't even know.

Just the cover of a program

Of some London show.



Charley's a nice boy,

A dear boy,

A sweet boy,

A fine boy,

A good boy through and through

I shall be patiently waiting

When Charley returns from that urgent

Rendezvous.



(spoken) A French word. I've seen it in a novel. Rendezvous. Meaning...



That woman, That woman

I know he's with that woman

I'm sure he's with that woman on the piano in his room.

That woman, That woman

That monster of a woman

Cast a spell over my intended groom.

It's ended, all ended.

They're up there sweetly sighing

And I thought love undying

Had just begun to bloom.

Oh! The shame of it.

A woman in his room.
