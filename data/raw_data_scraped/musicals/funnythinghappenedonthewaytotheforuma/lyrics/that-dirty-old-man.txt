That Dirty Old Man


PHILIA

Let the captain wed me and woo me,

I shall play my part!

Let him make his mad passion to me,

You will have my heart,

He can have the body he paid for,

Nothing but the body he paid for,

When he has the body he paid for,

Our revenge will start!



When I kiss him,

I'll be kissing you,

So I'll kiss him morning and night -

That'll show him,

When I hold him,

I'll be holding you,

So I'll hold him ten times as tight -

That'll show him, too!

I shall coo and tenderly stroke his hair,

Wish that you were there -

You'd enjoy it!



When It's evening

And we're in our tent for two,

I'll sit on his knee,

Get to know him intimately,

That'll show him

How much I really love you!
