The House of Marcus Lycus


PSEUDOLUS

Lycus, I am now in the market for a lifetime companion. Tell me, have you anything

lying about in there, anything to satisfy and Olympian appetite?



LYCUS

Pseudolus, friend and citizen, I have traveled the world in search of beauty, and I can

say with modesty that I have the finest assortment in Rome.



PSEUDOUS

Show me.



LYCUS

Eunichs! A buyer!



There is merchandise for every need.

At the house of Marcus Lycus.

All the merchandise is guaranteed,

At the house of Marcus Lycus.

For a sense of sensuality

Or an opulance thereof,

Patronize the house of Marcus Lycus,

Merchant of love.



For your most assured approval and your more than possible purchase, here are the

fruits of my search. Behold . . . Tintinabula. Out of the east with the face of an

idol . . . the arms of a willow tree . . . and the pelvis of a camel.



Next, may I present Panacea?

To make her available to you, I outbid the King of Nubia. Panacea, with a face that holds

a thousand promises, and a body that stands behind each promise.



Or consider the Geminae.

A matched pair. Either one a divinely assembled woman, together an infinite number of

mathematical possibilities.



An now, prepare yourself for Vibrata. Vibrata?

Exotic as a desert bloom . . . wonderous as a flamingo . . . lithe as a tigress . . .

for the man whose interest is wild life . . .



And now the ultimate: Gymnasia.

Gymnasia: a giant stage on which a thousand dramas can be played.



There is mercandise foe every need



GIRLS

At the house of Marcus Lycus.



LYCUS

All the merchandise is guarunteed



GIRLS

At the house of Marcus Lycus.



LYCUS

For a sense of sensibility

And a plethora thereof . . .

One is Ecstasy,

One is Mystery,

One is six foot three,

Two is company --

At the House of Marcus Lycus,

Merchant of Love.



And need I add, as all who are of the house of Lycus, these beauties are well versed

in the arts, proficient at needlework, and surprised at nothing.



6.Lovely





PHILIA

I'm lovely,

All I am is lovely,

Lovely is the one thing I can do.

Winsome,

Radiant as in some,

Dream come true.



Oh,

Isn't it a shame?

I can neither sew,

Nor cook, Nor read or write my name.



But I'm happy

Merely being lovely,

For it's one thing I can give to you.



HERO

Philia . . .



PHILIA

Yes?



HERO

Say my name.



PHILIA

Just say your name?



HERO

Yes.



PHILIA

Very well.

I have forgotten it.



HERO

It's Hero.



PHILIA

Oh, forgive me, Hero. I have no memory for names.



HERO

You don't need it. You don't need anything



You're lovely.

Absolutely lovely.

Who'd believe the lovelyness of you?

Winsome,

Sweet and warm and winsome,

Radiant as in some

Dream come true.



PHILIA

True!



PROTEANS

True!



HERO

Now Venus would seem tame,

Helen and her thousand ships

Would have to die of shame



PROTEANS

Lovely, Lovely

MM-MM-MM



BOTH

And I'm happy,

Happy that you're (I'm) lovely,



For there's one thing loveliness can do;

It's a gift for me to share with you!
