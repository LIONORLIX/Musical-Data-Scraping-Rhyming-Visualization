Funeral Sequence


PSEUDOLUS

Gather around, handmaidens of sorrow.



MILES

Sound the flute,

Blow the horn,

Pluck the lute,

Forward mourn!



All Crete was at her feet,

All Thrace was in her thrall,

All Sparta loved her sweetness

And gaul . . .



PSEUDOLUS

And Spain . . .



MILES

And Greece . . .



PSEUDOLUS

And Egypt . . .



MILES

And Syria . . .



PSEUDOLUS

And Mesopotamia . . .



MOURNERS

All Crete was at her feet,

All Thrace was in her thrall,

Oh, why should such a blossom fall?



MILES

Speak the spells,

Chant the charms,

Toll the bells -



PSEUDOLUS

Fold the arms!



Sir, on behalf of the body, I want to thank you for a lovely funeral.

I don't know about you, but I've suffered enough. If you will just give me

the contract, I shall take the body and then . . .



MILES

Strew the soil,

Strum the lyre,

Spread the oil,

Build the pyre!



PSEUDOLUS

Whoa! A pyre? What kind of pyre?



MILES

A pyre of fire.



PSEUDOLUS

Oh, a fire pyre.



MILES

She must be burned!



PSEUDOLUS

Burned? Sir!



MILES

I want her ashes!



PSEUDOLUS

Captain, I implore you: It is not for us to destroy such loveliness.

The gods are aeaiting her. They would not be happy if we sent up a charred virgin.



MILES

I cannot afford to offend the gods.



PSEUDOLUS

Who can?

All Crete was at her feet,

But I shall weep no more,

I'll find my consolation as before,

Among the simple pleasures of war!
