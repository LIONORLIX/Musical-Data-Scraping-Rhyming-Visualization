Oh My Love


oh my love for the first time in

my life

my eyes are wide open

oh my lover for the first time in

my life

my eyes can see

i see the wind, oh i see the

trees

everything is clear in my heart

i see the clouds, oh i see the

sky

everything is clear in our world

oh my love for the first time in

my life

my mind is wide open

oh my lover for the first time in

my life

my mind can feel

i feel sorrow, oh i feel dreams

everything is clear in my heart

everything is clear in our world

i feel life, oh i feel love
