Mother, You had Me I never had you

I wanted you but you didn't want me

So I got to tell you

Goodbye , Goodbye



Father, You left me but I never left you

I needed you but you didn't need me

So I just got to tell you

Goodbye , Goodbye



Children, Don't do what I have done

I couldn't walk so I tried to run

So I got to tell you

Goodbye , Goodbye
