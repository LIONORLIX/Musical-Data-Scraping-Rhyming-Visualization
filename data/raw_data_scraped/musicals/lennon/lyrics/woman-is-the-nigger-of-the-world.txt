Woman Is the Nigger of the World


Woman is the nigger of

the world

Yes she is...think about it

Woman is the nigger of

the world

Think about it...do

something about it



We make her paint her

face and dance

If she won't be slave ,we

say that she don't love us

If she's real, we say she's

trying to be a man

While putting her down we

pretend that she is above us

Woman is the nigger of

the world...yes she is

If you don't belive me take a

look to the one you're with

Woman is the slaves of

the slaves

Ah yeah...better screem

about it

We make her bear and raise

our children

And then we leave her flat for

being a fat old mother hen

We tell her home is the only

place she would be

Then we complain that she's

too unworldly to be our friend

Woman is the nigger of

the world...yes she is

If you don't belive me take a

look to the one you're with

Woman is the slaves of

the slaves

Yeah (think about it)



We insult her everyday on TV

And wonder why she has no

guts or confidence

When she's young we kill her

will to be free

While telling her not to be so

smart we put her down for being so dumb

Woman is the nigger of

the world...yes she is

If you don't belive me take a

look to the one you're with

Woman is the slaves of

the slaves

Yes she is...if you belive me,

you better screem about it.



Repeat:

We make her paint her

face and dance

We make her paint her

face and dance We make her paint her

face and dance
