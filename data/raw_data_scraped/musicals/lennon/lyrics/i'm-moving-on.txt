I'm Moving On


Save your sweet talk for when you score

Keep your Monday kisses for your glass lady

I want the truth and nothing more

I'm moving on, moving on you're getting phony



You didn't have to tell a white lie

You knew you scored me for life

Don't stick your finger in my pie

You know I'll see through your jive

I want the truth and nothing more

I'm moving, moving on we're getting phony



When you were angry you had love in your eyes

When you were sad you had dream in your voice

But now you're giving me your window smile

I'm moving on, moving on it's getting phony



Moving onnnnnnnnnn!
