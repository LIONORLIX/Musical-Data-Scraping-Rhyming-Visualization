How Do You Sleep


so sgt. pepper took you by

surprise

you better see right through that

mother's eyes

those freaks was right when they

said you was you was dead

the one mistake you made was

in your head

how do you sleep?

ah how do you sleep at night?

you live with straights who tell

you you was king

jum when your mamma tell

you anything

the only thing you done was

yesterday

and since you've gone it's just

another day

how do you sleep?

ah how do you sleep at night?

a pretty face may last a year

or two

but pretty soon they'll see

what you can do

the sound you make is muzak

to my ears

you must have learned

something all those years

how do you sleep?

ah how do you sleep at night?
