Bigger Isn't Better


Bigger isn't better

Taller isn't braver

Stronger isn't always wise



Smaller isn't necessarily the lesser

Guts can come in any size



Lady luck can favor

Just a little shaver

Over one who's 6-foot-3



Brains in any tussle

Mop the floor with muscle

Bet your life I'm glad I'm me



(Chorus:)

Bigger isn't keener

Larger isn't bolder

Higher might be low inside

When you need to lean upon a friendly shoulder

Narrow's just as good as wide

See the mighty lion sittin there and crying bitten by a tiny flea

Mammoth was colossal what's he now? A fossil!

Bet your life I'm glad I'm me



What strong and hope they lag along

Get brains and heart

That handsome hunk might be a Lilliputian medley,

Proven consequently...

Though he shows his shoulders twice as big as boulders

If his brain's a tiny pea

When your in a pickle

He ain't worth a nickel

Bet your life I'm...Bet your life I'm glad I'm me



(Spoken)

Ladies and Gentlemen together for the first time

Mister PT Barnum's two star attractions

General Top Dog and Jumbo!



That's some elephant!



Aw, isn't the little guy cute?



Let me see, let me see!



BRANDON, get back here!



I'm OK Mom!



(Back to Singing)

The dinosaur's no more, the dear old dodo's dead,

But right there on that floor some ants will still be treadin after Armageddon

Bet there isn't a hero, weight is less than zero

Height ain't worth a hoot in hell

Show me any hunk of man to match the spunk of

Tiny Tim or Little Nell

Giants look so awesome folks are scared to cross em'

None the less I guarantee

Small as Yankee Doodle if he's in the moodle beat the whole

Caboodle using just his noodle...

Bet your life I'm glad I'm ME!!!
