The Colors Of My Life (Part 2)


Spoken:

It`s your own fault Charity Barnum

If you only asked a few logical questions

Before you married him

You would have put a healthy distance

Between yourself and a fella

Who wants to give the whole words a paint job

Which I?m not so sure it needs



Sung:

The colors of my life

Are softer than a breeze.

The silver gray of eiderdown,

The dappled green of trees.

The amber of a wheat field,

The hazel of a seed,

The crystal of a raindrop,

Are all I'll ever need.

Your reds are much too bold,

In gold I find no worth.

I'll fill my days with sage and brown

The colors of the earth,

And if from by my side

My love should roam,

The colors of my life

Will shine a quiet light

To lead him home.
