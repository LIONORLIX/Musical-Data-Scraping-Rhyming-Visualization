Museum Song


Spoken:

Everything about my museum was spectacular,

including the price: one dollar.

Now that may seem a bit steep, but it was worth

it. Look at what I gave 'em:



Sung:

Quite a lotta

Roman terra cotta

Livin' lava from the flanks of Etna

Statuary

Ride a dromedary

See the Temple tumble and the Red Sea part.



McNamara's band

The fattest lady in the land

A pickled prehistoric hand

A strand of Pocahontas' hair

Crow and Sioux

Who're going to

Be showing you

Some rowing through

A model of the rapids on the Delaware.



Armadillas

Clever caterpillas

Reproductions of the Cyclops' ret'na

Crystal blowing

Automatic sewing

Venus on a shell and other works of art.



Educated fleas

A tribe of Aborigines

Two ladies joined across the knees

A Mona Lisa made of ice

Hottentots

We've gotten in

Forgotten spots

A cotton gin

A night with Lot in Sodom

Better see that twice!



One iguana

Snakes and other fauna

Got no bearded lady but we're get'na

When you duck out

Take another buck out

Run around the block And see a

Run around the block and see a

Run around the block and see a

new show start.
