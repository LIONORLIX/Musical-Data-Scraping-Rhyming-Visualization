The Colors Of My Life (Part 1)


The colors of my life

Are bountiful and bold,

The purple glow of indigo,

The gleam of green and gold.

The splendor of the sunrise,

The dazzle of a flame,

The glory of a rainbow,

I'd put 'em all to shame.

No quiet browns and grays,

I'll take my days instead

And fill them till they overflow

With rose and cherry red!

And should this sunlit world

Grow dark one day,

The colors of my life

Will leave a shining light

To show the way...

No quiet browns and grays,

I'll take my days instead

And fill them till they overflow

With rose and cherry red!

And should this sunlit world

Grow dark one day,

The colors of my life

Will leave a shining light

To show the way...
