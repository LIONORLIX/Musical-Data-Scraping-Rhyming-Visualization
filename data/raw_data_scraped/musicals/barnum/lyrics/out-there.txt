Out There


Staying home, living day by day

May be safe, but it can't be duller.

Seeing things only black and gray

When the world is alive with color.

Doing just as your neighbors do

May be wise, but it ain't so clever.

Every man has a dream or two

Let 'em go and they're gone forever.



Out there somewhere just out of sight.

There's a world that's blazing with light.

Ain't each man alive got the right?

To stray just a mite from the straight and narrow,

Shoot through the night like a flaming arrow.



Turning back should the highway bend

Turning down every chance you're given.

Takes the risk out of life, but friend

How the hell can you call that livin'?

Staying put in a pumpkin shell

Is a bleak and depressing habit.

There's a ring on the carousel

And it's yours if you'll only grab it.



Out there somewhere just down the line.

Lies a world of glory and shine.

One square foot there's gotta be mine.

Once in his life every man decides

Once when he stands where the road divides

Once on a hill as the morning grows Once if he will he can see those..



Fires glow, flags streaming

Spires grow, towers gleaming



In a land where the dawn is clear

In a sky where the sun's forever.

On a plain where it's spring all year

And the dark of the night is never.



Somewhere out there just out of sight

In that world that's shining with light.

Ain't each man alive got the right?

Once in his life to forget the past.

Once in his life to behold at last.

With his own two eyes what

Lies..Out..There!
