Love Makes Such Fools Of Us All


Jenny Lind:

Botrom all grans,

U tom all tid,

Charlikens ler och lockar.

Charlekens vind,

Branner som eld,

Spranger den hook-sta mur.

Botrom all grans,

U tom all tid,

Charlekens dorskop oss fur



Love knows no rules,

Love has no time,

Love laughs at rhyme and reason,

Sweeping the stage,

Mad or sublime,

Knowing no age or season.

Wise men and fools,

Playing love's game,

Bend to the same sweet treason.

Love's silver song,

Swift as a flame,

Bends to the strongest wall.

Love knows no rules,

Love has no time,

Love makes such fools of us all.
