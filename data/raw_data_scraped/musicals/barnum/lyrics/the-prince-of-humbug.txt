The Prince Of Humbug


The Prince of Humbug.

Balderdash.

Fiddle, Faddle, Drivel, Posh

Twiddle, Twaddle, Blather, Bosh.

Bilge and dodge and double-dutch

And Flim-Flam I am!



The King of Hogwash.

Tommyrot.

Jibber, Jabber, Blabber, Bluff

Hocus-Pocus, Gabble, Guff.

Scam and sham and just a touch

Of white lie am I.



Duke of tripe and idle chat.

Earl of oil, Lord of flat.

Emperor of rigmarole.

That I am, Bless my soul.



The Prince of Humbug.

Poppycock.

Piffle, waffle, panner junk

Hokum, Hooey, chatter, bunk.

Wile and guile and trumpery.

That's me.



In a world of sting and shock

This moment we spend.

Down a road of ridge and rot

Toward Lord knows what end.

Through a night as dark as space and cold as the sea.

Someone's got to make it right.

Shoot a rocket, Shine a light.

Tell you who the someone's gonna be!



The Prince of Humbug.

Tongue-in-cheek.

Shilly, Shally, pull the wool,

Blarney, bogus, cock and bull.

Hoax and prank and hanky-pank

And some skullduggery.



I am! And damn, I'll always be!

Yeah!
