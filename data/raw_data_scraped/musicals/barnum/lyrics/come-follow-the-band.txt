Come Follow The Band


Come follow the band

Wherever it's at

Let both of your feet, beat, time to the drum

And feel your heart go rat 'a' tat tat



A flag in your hand

A plume in your hat

Petallions of brass, pass, and catch the light

Is there a sight that's sweeter then that?



See the pretty lady toss that baton high ain't she cute as a daisy

Watch the fellow with the big bass drum go by

Ain't ya glad that you stayed

Hear the trombone play the Oompah pah

Ain't it drivin' you crazy

Don't ya be so darn lazy

Better hurry 'n' join that big parade



Up out of your seat

Down off of the stand

Step out to the sweet beat the bugle plays

A sound that you'll remember all your days

And when you see the leader proudly raise his hand

Just follow the band



Hear the trumpet blast

And the hornet blare

Hear the boom of the bass

And the rattle of the snare

With the sweetest burst of melody I know

It's the piccolo



Hear the silver tone of the xylophone

Hear the glide ansd the bellow of the slide trombone

With a burst of crystal listen to it peal

It's the glockenspiel



With a most majestic manner you'll remember all your life

Come xylophone, come saxophone, come susiphone, come fife
