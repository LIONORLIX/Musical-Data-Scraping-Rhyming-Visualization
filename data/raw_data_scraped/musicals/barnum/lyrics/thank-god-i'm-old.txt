Thank God I'm Old


Joyce Heth:



When you see the shape the world is in

When the way it is ain't what it's been

When folks just care for gold,

Thank God, I'm old

When you take a gander at the news

When you hear the language people use

When no sweet songs are sung

I don't wanna be young



Daddy time he

Doesn't fret me

Should he spy me

That don't upset me

Let him eye me

Come and get me

That's fine by me

Age don't worry me



When you see the way folks misbehave

When it's only good times that they crave

When kids are much too bold

Thank God, I'm old

When there ain't no He-Men left alive

When they tell you three men out of five

End up locked up or hung

I don't wanna be young.



(Dance Break)



Gonna get me dressed and powdered down

Call myself a hack and go to town

See every shady street

These feet once strolled.

Then I'm gonna slip back on the shelf

Have myself a nip and tell myself

Though my back buckles and bends

My hair's got silvery ends

When I see all of my friends

Laid out and cold

Thank God, I'm Old!
