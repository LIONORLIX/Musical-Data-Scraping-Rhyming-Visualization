I Like Your Style


Barnum:

We're out of step

We disagree

What's right for you Is wrong for me

Together we're apart a country mile

But I like your style

I like your style



Charity:

We're out of step

We disagree

What's right for you is wrong for me

When I propose

Then you protest

What's my delight

You just detest

Too sweet a fight to ever reconcile



Barnum:

Too sweet a fight to ever reconcile



Charity:

But I like your style



Barnum:

I like your style



Charity:

I like your style

No shouts or quarrels

No blows or tears



Both:

One simple fuss

To dissect and discuss

For the next

One hundred years



Charity:

Each blessed day



Barnum:

Each blessed day



Charity:

We sweetly fill



Barnum:

We sweetly fill



Charity:

With no you won't



Barnum:

With no you won't



Charity:

And yes I will



Barnum:

And yes I will



Charity:

You wonder how we made it down the aisle



Barnum:

You wonder how we made it down the aisle



Charity:

Well I liked your style



Barnum:

I liked your style



Charity:

I liked your style



(High Spirited Dance)

Charity:

Each blessed day



Barnum:

Each blessed day



Charity:

We sweetly fill



Barnum:

We sweetly fill



Charity:

With no you won't



Barnum:

With no you won't



Charity:

And yes I will



Barnum:

And yes I will



Charity:

You wonder how we made it down the aisle



Barnum:

You wonder how we made it down the aisle



Charity:

Well I liked your style



Barnum:

I liked your style



Charity:

I liked your style



Barnum:

I liked your style



Charity:

I liked your style



Both:

I liked your style,

Style,

Style!
