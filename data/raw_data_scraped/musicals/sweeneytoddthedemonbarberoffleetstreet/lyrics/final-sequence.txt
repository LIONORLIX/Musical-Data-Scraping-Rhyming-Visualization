Final Sequence


JUDGE:

(spoken)

Where is she? Where is the girl?



TODD:

(spoken)

Down below, your honor,

With my neighbor, Mrs. Lovett.

Thank heaven, the sailor

Did not molest her

Thank heaven too,

She has seen the error of her ways



JUDGE:

(spoken)

She has?



TODD:

(spoken)

Oh yes, sir... she speaks only of you.

Longing for forgiveness



JUDGE:

(spoken)

And she shall have it!

(sung)

Pretty women



TODD:

(sung)

Pretty women, yes



JUDGE:

(spoken)

Quickly sir, a splash of bayrum



TODD:

(spoken)

Sit sir, sit



JUDGE:

(sung)

Johanna, Johanna



TODD:

(sung)

Pretty women, pretty women

Are a wonder



JUDGE:

(spoken simultaneously)

Quickly man! You are in merry mood again, today, barber!



TODD:

(sung)

Pretty women



JUDGE/TODD:

(sung)

What we do for pretty women

(simultaneously)

Blowing out their candles or

(Blowing out their candles, oh!)

Combing out their hair,

Combing out their hair, and they-)

Even when they leave

(Even when they leave you and vanish)

They still are there.

(They somehow can still remain there)

They're there



JUDGE:

(spoken)

How seldom it is,

one meets a fellow spirit



TODD:

(spoken)

With fellow tastes...

In women, at least



JUDGE:

(spoken)

What?! What's that?!



TODD:

(spoken)

No doubt, the years have changed me

But then, I suppose,

The face of a barber, the face

Of a prisoner in the dark

Is hardly memorable



JUDGE:

(shouted)

Beenjamin Barker?!



TODD:

(shouted)

Benjamin Barker!

(sung)

Rest now, my friends

Rest now forever

Sleep now, the untroubled sleep

Of the angels--



MRS. LOVETT

(shouted from of stage)

DIE! DIE! GOD IN HEAVEN, DIE!



(quick "Ballad Of Sweeney Todd" reprise)



MRS. LOVETT:

(spoken)

Can it be?

Have all the demons in Hell

Come to torment me?



TODD:

(spoken)

Why did you scream?

Does the judge still live?!



MRS. LOVETT:

No! Don't touch her!



TODD:

What are you talking about?

It's just some mental, old

Beggar woman--

Oh no...Oh God!

"Don't I know you," she said..

You knew..

From the moment I walked into your shop

You knew my Lucy lived..



MRS. LOVETT:

I was only thinking of you..

Your Lucy, a crazy hag

Picking bones and rotten spuds

Out of alley ash cans!

Would you have wanted to know

That was all that was left of her?



TODD:

(muttered)

You lied to me..



MRS. LOVETT:

(simulataneously with TODD)

No, no, not lied at all

No, I never lied, said she

Took a poison, she did

Never said that she died

Poor thing, but it left her weak in

Her head, all she did for weeks

Was just lie there in bed

Should've been in hospital,

Wound up in bedlam, instead

Poor thing, better you to think

She was dead, yes,

I lied, 'cause I love you

I'd be twice the wive she was!

I love you!



TODD:

Lucy, I've come home again

Lucy, oh my God!

(then)

TODD:

(sung)

Mrs. Lovett, you're a bloody wonder

Eminently practical, and yet

Appropriate as always

As you've said, repeatedly,

There's little point in

Dwelling on the past

(now simulatneously with MRS. LOVETT)

Now come here, my love

Nothing left to fear my love

What's dead, is dead



MRS. LOVETT:

Do you mean it?

Everything I did, I swear,

I thought was only for the best

Believe me, can we,

Still be, married?



TODD:

(sung simulataneously with MRS. LOVETT)

The history of the world, my pet

Is learn forgiveness, and try

To forget

And life is for the alive, my dear

So let's keep living it,

Just keep living it

Really living it!



MRS. LOVETT

Oh Mr. Todd, ooh Mr. Todd,

Leave it to me

Dont you see, Mr. Todd,

We'll be comfy cozy, you and me

Mr. Todd, where there's no one nosey

Just keep living it,

Really living it--



TODD:

(sung, holding back tears)

There was a barber and his wife,

And she was beautiful

A foolish barbr and his wife,

She was his reason and his life

And she was beautiful,

And she was virtuous,

And he was, naive



TOBIAS:

(sung)

Patty cake, patty cake

Baker's man,

Bake me a cake..no, no..

Bake me a pie, to delight my eye..

(spoken)

Mr. Todd? Oh..

Where's the old woman?

You've harmed her too, have you?

You shouldn't, you know?

You shouldn't harm nobody..

Oh, razor, razor

Cut-a, cut-a, cut-a, cut-a

(sung)

Bat him, and prick him,

And mark him with a "B"

And put him in the over for baby

And me

(kills Todd)
