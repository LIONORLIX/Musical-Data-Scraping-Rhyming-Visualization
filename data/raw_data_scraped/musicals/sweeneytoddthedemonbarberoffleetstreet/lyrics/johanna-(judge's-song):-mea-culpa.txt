Johanna (Judge's Song): Mea Culpa


Judge:

Mea cupla, mea culpa

Mea maxima culpa

Mea maxima maxima culpa!

God deliever me! Release me!

Forgive me! Restrain me! Pervade me!



Johanna johanna

So suddenly a woman,

The light behind your window---

It penetrates your gown,

Johanna johanna

The sun---i see the sun through your--

No!

God!

Deliver me! Deliver me!

Down!

Down.

Down.....



Johanna johanna

I watch you from the shadows.

You sigh before your window

And gaze upon the town

Your lips part johanna

So young and soft and beautiful----

God!

Deliver me!

Filth.

Leave me!



Johanna johanna

I treasured you in innocence

And loved you like a daughter

You mock me, johanna

You tempt me with your innocence

You tempt with those quivering---

No!

God!

Deliver me!

It will---

Stop---

Now! It will---

Stop---

Right.

Now.

Right

Now.

Right

Now...



Johanna, johanna

I cannot keep you longer

The world is at your window

You want to fly away

You stir me, johanna

So suddenly a woman

I cannot watch you one more day---

God!

Deilver me!

God!

Deliver me!

God!

Deliver----!

God!!!!!



Johanna, johanna

I'll keep you here forever

I'll wed on the morrow

Johanna johanna

The world will never touch you

I'll wed you on the morrow

As years pass, johanna

You'll tend me in my solitude

No longer as my daughter

As a woman

Johanna johanna

I'll hold you here forever then

You'll keep away from windows and

You'll

Deliver me.

Johanna.

From this

Hot

Red

Devil

With your

Soft

White

Cool

Virgin

Palms.
