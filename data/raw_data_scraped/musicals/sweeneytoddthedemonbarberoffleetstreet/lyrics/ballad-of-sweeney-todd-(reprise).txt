Ballad of Sweeney Todd (Reprise)


Company



Lift your razor high!

Sweeney!

Hear it singing!

Yes!

Stick it in the rosy skin of righteousness!

His voice was soft, his manner mild.

He seldom laughed but he often smiled.

He'd seen how civilized men behaved.

He never forgot

and he never forgave.

Not Sweeney...

Not Sweeney Todd...

The Demon barber of Fleet Street
