Wait


MRS. LOVETT:

Easy now,

Hush, love, hush,

Don't distress yourself,

What's your rush?

Keep your thoughts

Nice and lush,

Wait.



Hush, love, hush,

Think it through.

Once it bubbles, then

What's to do?

Watch it close.

Let it brew.

Wait.



I've been thinkin' flowers,

Maybe daisies,

To brighten up the room!

Don't you think some flowers,

Pretty daisies,

Might relieve the gloom?

Ah, wait,

Love, wait.



TODD: (spoken) And the judge? When will I get to him?



LOVETT:

Can't you think of nothin' else?

Always broodin' away on your wrongs

what happened heaven knows how many years ago!



Slow, love, slow.

Time's so fast.

Now goes quickly, see

Now it's past!

Soon will come,

Soon will last.

Wait.



Don't you know,

Silly man?

Half the fun is to

Plan the plan!

All good things

Come to those who can

Wait.



Gillyflowers, maybe,

'Stead of daisies...

I dunno though...

What do you think?
