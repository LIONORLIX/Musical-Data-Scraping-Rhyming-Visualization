Tobias



Attend the tale of sweeney todd.

His skin was pale and his eye was odd.

He shaved the faces of gentlemen

Who never thereafter were heard of again.

He trod a path that few have trod

Did sweeney todd

The demon barber of fleet street.

He kept a shop in london town.

Of fancy clients and good renown

And what if none of their souls were saved

They went to their maker impecably shaved.

By sweeney,

By sweeney todd

The demon barber of fleet street.



Company



Swing your razor wide!

Sweeney, hold it to the skies.

Freely flows the blood of those who moralize.

His needswere few, his room was bare.

A lavabo and a fancy chair.

A mug of suds, and a leather strop,

An apron, a towel, a pail, and a mop.

For neatness he deserves a nod,

Does sweeney todd,

The demon barber of fleet street.

Inconspicuous sweeney was,

Quick, and quiet and clean he was.

Back of his smile, under his word,

Sweeney heard music that nobody heard.

Sweeney pondered and sweeney planned,

Like a perfect machine he planned,

Sweeney was smooth, sweeney was subtle,

Sweeney would blink, and rats would scuttle

Sweeney was smooth, sweeney was subtle

Sweeney would blink, and rats would scuttle

Sweeney was smooth, sweeney was subtle,

Sweeney would blink, and rats would scuttle

Sweeney was smooth, sweeney was subtle,

Sweeney would blink, and rats would scuttle

Sweeney! Sweeney! Sweeney! Sweeney!

Sweeney!



Sweeney todd



Attend the tale of sweeney todd!



Company



Attend the tale of sweeney todd!



Sweeney todd



He served a dark and avengeful god!



Company



He served a dark and avengeful god!



Sweeney todd



What happened then, well that's the play,

And he wouldn't want us to give it away...



Company



Not sweeney

Not sweeney todd

The demon barber of fleet...

Street...
