Pretty Women


Pretty women

Fascinating...

Sipping coffee,

Dancing... pretty women

Pretty women

Are a wonder.

Pretty women!



Sitting in the window or

Standing on the stair

Something in them cheers the air.



Pretty women

Silhouetted...

Stay within you,

Glancing... stay forever,

Breathing lightly...

Pretty women,

Pretty women!



Blowing out their candles or

Combing out their hair,

Even when they leave

They still are there.

They're there



Ah! Pretty women, at their mirrors,

In their gardens,

Letter-writing,

Flower-picking,

Weather-watching.

How they make a man sing!



Proof of heaven as you're living,

Pretty women! Yes, pretty women!

Here's to pretty women,

Pretty women,

Pretty women,

Pretty women
