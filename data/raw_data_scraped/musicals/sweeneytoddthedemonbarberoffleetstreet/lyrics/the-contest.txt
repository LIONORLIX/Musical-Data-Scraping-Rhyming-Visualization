Adolfo Pirelli: I am Adolfo Pirelli

Da king of da barbers

Da barber of kings

E buon giorno, good day

I blow you a kiss!



And I, da so famous Pirelli

I wish-a to know-a

Who has-a the nerve-a to say

My elixir is piss!

Who says this?!



Sweeney Todd: "I do. [...] I am Mr. Sweeney Todd of Fleet Street. I have opened

a bottle of Pirelli's elixer and I say to you that it is nothing but an

errant fraud, concocted from piss and ink. Furthermore -'Signor'-

I have serviced no kings, yet I wager that I can shave a cheek

with ten times more dexterity than any street mountebank!"



Adolfo Pirelli: "You hear zis foolish man? Now, please, you will see how

he will regret his folly!"



Sweeney Todd: "Who's for a free shave?"



[The Crowd cheers: ME, ME, ME!]



Sweeney Todd: "Will Beadle Bamford be the judge?"



Beadle Bamford: "Glad, as always to oblige my friends and neighbours.

...The fastest, smoothest shave, is the winner."



[Music begins]



Adolfo Pirelli: Now signorini, signori

We mix-a da lather

But first-a you gather around

Signorini, signori

You looking a man

Who had-a da glory

To shave-a da Pope!

Mr. Sweeney whoever--

I beg-a you pardon

You'll probably say it was only a cardinal--

Nope!

It was-a da pope!



To shave-a da face

To cut-a da hair

Require da grace

Require da flair

For if-a you slip

You nick da skin

You clip-a da chin

You rip-a da lip a bit beyond-a repair!



To shave-a da face

Or even a part

Widout it-a smart

Require da heart!

Not just-a da flash

It take-a panache

It take-a da passion for da art



To shave-a da face

To trim-a da beard

To make-a da bristle

Clean like a whistle

Dis is from early infancy

Da talent give to me

By God!



It take-a da skill

It take-a da brains

It take-a da will

To take-a da pains

It take-a da pace

It take-a da graaaace!



Beadle Bamford: "The winner -- is Todd!"
