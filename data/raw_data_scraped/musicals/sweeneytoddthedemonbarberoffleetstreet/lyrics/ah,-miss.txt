Ah, Miss


ANTHONY (Gazing at her, sings softly):

I have sailed the world,

Beheld its wonders,

From the pearls of Spain

To the rubies of Tibet,

But not even in London

Have I seen such a wonder . . .

(Breathlessly)

Lady look at me look at me miss oh

Look at me please oh

Favor me favor me with your glance.

Ah, miss,

What do you what do you see off

There in those trees oh

Won't you give won't you give me a chance?

Who would sail to Spain

For all its wonders,

When in Kearney's Lane

Lies the greatest wonder yet?

Ah, miss,

Look at you look at you pale and

Ivory-skinned oh

Look at you looking so sad so queer.

Promise

Not to retreat to the darkness

Back of your window

Not till you not till you look down here.

Look at



ANTHONY. JOHANNA:

Me! Green finch and linnet bird,

Look at Nightingale, blackbird,

Me! Teach me how to sing.

If I cannot fly,

Look at me .. . Let me sing ...



BEGGAR WOMAN:

Alms, Alms for a miserable woman.

Beg your pardon, it's you sir, thank you, thank you kindly.



ANTHONY (spoken):

One moment mother, perhaps you know who's house this is.



BEGGAR WOMAN:

ANTHONY:

BEGGAR WOMAN:

(increasingly nervous) Oh her? Well that's J-Johanna, His pretty little ward.

Oh but don't you go tresspassing there young man. Not if you value your hide.

Tamper there and it's a good wippin' for ya,

(Sing-song) Hey, Oink sailor boy, want it's lovely harbored,

ANTHONY: Off with you, OFF!
