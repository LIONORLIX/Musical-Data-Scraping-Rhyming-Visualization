The Barber and His Wife


TODD:

There's a hole in the world like a great black pit

And the vermin of the world inhabit it

And it's morals aren't worth what a pig could spit

And it goes by the name of London...



There was a barber and his wife,

And she was beautiful.

A foolish barber and his wife.

She was his reason and his life,

And she was beautiful,

And she was virtuous,

And he was... naive.



There was another man who saw

That she was beautiful.

A pious vulture of the law,

Who, with a gesture of his claw,

Removed the barber from his plate,

Then there was nothing but to wait,

And she would fall,

So soft,

So young,

So lost

And oh so beautiful!



ANTHONY: And the lady, sir, did she succumb?



TODD:

Oh, that was many years ago...

I doubt if anyone would know...



[dialogue]



There's a hole in the world like a great black pit

And it's filled with people who are filled with shit

And the vermin of the world inhabit it...
