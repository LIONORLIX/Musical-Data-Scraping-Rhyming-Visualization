Johanna (Quartet)


ANTHONY:

I feel you, Johanna, I feel you

Do they think that walls can hide you?

Even now I'm at your window

I am in the dark beside you,

Buried sweetly in your yellow hair, Johanna?



SWEENEY TODD:

And are you beautiful and pale,

With yellow hair, like her

I'd want you beautiful and pale,

The way I've dreamed you were, Johanna...



ANTHONY:

Johanna...



SWEENEY TODD:

And if you're beautiful, what then,

With yellow hair, like wheat?

I think we shall not meet again ?

My little dove, my sweet Johanna?



ANTHONY:

I'll steal you, Johanna?



SWEENEY TODD:

Goodbye, Johanna.

You're gone, and yet you're mine.

I'm fine, Johanna, I'm fine!



ANTHONY:

Johanna?



BEGGAR WOMAN:

Smoke! Smoke! Sign of the devil! Sign of the devil!

City on fire!

Witch! Witch! Smell it, sir! An evil smell!

Every night at the vespers bell ?

Smoke that comes from the mouth of hell ?

City on fire! City on fire!

Mischief! Mischief! Mischief...



SWEENEY TODD:

And if I never hear your voice,

My turtledove, my dear,

I still have reason to rejoice:

The way ahead is clear, Johanna...



JOHANNA:

I'll marry Anthony Sunday

Anthony?Sunday?



ANTHONY:

I feel you?



SWEENEY TODD:

And in that darkness when I'm blind

With what I can't forget ?



ANTHONY:

Johanna?



SWEENEY TODD:

It's always morning in my mind,

My little lamb, my pet, Johanna?



JOHANNA:

I knew you'd come for me one day?

Come for me?one day?



SWEENEY TODD/ANTHONY:

You stay, Johanna ? Johanna?



SWEENEY TODD:

The way I've dreamed you are

Oh look, Johanna ? a star!



ANTHONY:

Buried sweetly in your yellow hair?



SWEENEY TODD:

A shooting star!



BEGGAR WOMAN:

There! There! Somebody, somebody look up there!

Didn't I tell you? Smell that air! City on fire!

Quick, sir! Run and tell!

Warn 'em all of the witch's spell!

There it is, there it is, the unholy smell!

Tell it to the Beadle and the police as well!

Tell 'em! Tell 'em! Help! Fiend!

City on fire! City on fire!

Mischief! Mischief! Mischief...Fiend . . .

Alms?alms...for a miserable woman?



SWEENEY TODD:

And though I'll think of you, I guess, until the day I die,

I think I miss you less and less as every day goes by,

Johanna...



ANTHONY:

Johanna...



JOHANNA:

With you beside me on Sunday,

Married on?Sunday?



SWEENEY TODD:

And you'd be beautiful and pale,

And look too much like her.

If only angels could prevail,

We'd be the way we were, Johanna...

ANTHONY:

I feel you...Johanna?



JOHANNA'S VOICE:

Married on Sunday?married on Sunday ...



SWEENEY TODD:

Wake up, Johanna! Another bright red day!

We learn, Johanna, to say goodbye!



ANTHONY:

I?ll steal you!
