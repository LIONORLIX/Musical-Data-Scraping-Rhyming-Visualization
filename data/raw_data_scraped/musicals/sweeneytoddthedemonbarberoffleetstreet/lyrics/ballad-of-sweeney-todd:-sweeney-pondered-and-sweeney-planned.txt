Ballad of Sweeney Todd: Sweeney pondered and Sweeney planned


Company:

Sweeney Pondered and Sweeney planned

like a perfect mahine'e planned

Barbing the hook, baiting the trap

Setting out for the Beadle to snap

Set a sort of a scene, 'e did

Laying the trail, showing the traces

letting it lead to higher places

SWEENEY.......
