Green Finch and Linnet Bird


JOHANNA (Sings):

Green finch and linnet bird,

Nightingale, blackbird,

How is it you sing?

How can you jubilate,

Sitting in cages,

Never taking wing?

Outside the sky waits,

Beckoning, beckoning,

Just beyond the bars.

How can you remain,

Staring at the rain,

Maddened by the stars?

How is it you sing

Anything?

How is it you sing?

Green finch and linnet bird,

Nightingale, blackbird,

How is it you sing?

Whence comes this melody constantly flowing?

Is it rejoicing or merely halloing?

Are you discussing or fussing

Or simply dreaming?

Are you crowing?

Are you screaming?

Ringdove and robinet,

Is it for wages,

Singing to be sold?

Have you decided it's

Safer in cages,

Singing when you're told?



(ANTHONY enters. Instantly he sees her and stands transfixed by her beauty)



My cage has many rooms,

Damask and dark.

Nothing there sings,

Not even my lark.

Larks never will, you know,

When they're captive.

Teach me to be more adaptive.

Green finch and linnet bird,

Nightingale, blackbird,

Teach me how to sing.

If I cannot fly,

Let me sing.

(She gazes into the middle distance disconsolately)



ANTHONY (Gazing at her, sings softly):

I have sailed the world,

Beheld its wonders,

From the pearls of Spain

To the rubies of Tibet,

But not even in London

Have I seen such a wonder . . .

(Breathlessly)

Lady look at me look at me miss oh

Look at me please oh

Favor me favor me with your glance.

Ah, miss,

What do you what do you see off

There in those trees oh

Won't you give won't you give me a chance?

Who would sail to Spain

For all its wonders,

When in Kearney's Lane

Lies the greatest wonder yet?

Ah, miss,

Look at you look at you pale and

Ivory-skinned oh

Look at you looking so sad so queer.

Promise

Not to retreat to the darkness

Back of your window

Not till you not till you look down here.

Look at



ANTHONY. JOHANNA:

Me! Green finch and linnet bird,

Look at Nightingale, blackbird,

Me! Teach me how to sing.

If I cannot fly,

Look at me .. . Let me sing ...
