Pirelli's Miracle Elixir


Tobias:

Ladies and Gentlemen!

May I have your attention please?

Do you wake every morning in shame and despair

To discover your pillow is covered with hair

Wot ought not to be there?

Well, ladies and gentlemen,

From now on you can waken with ease.

You need never again have a worry or care,

I will show you a miracle marvelous rare,

Gentlemen, you are about to see something wot rose

From the dead!

On the top of my head.



Scarcely a month ago, gentlemen,

I was suddenly struck with a rare

Oriental disease.

Though the finest physicians in London were called,

I awakened one morning amazed and appalled

To discover with dread that my head was as bald

As a novice's knees!

I was dying of shame

Till a gentleman came,

An illustrious barber, Pirelli by name.

He gave me a liquid as precious as gold.

I rubbed it in daily like wot I was told,

And behold!

Less than thirty days old!



'Twas Pirelli's

Miracle elixir

That's what did the trick, sir,

True, sir, true.

Was it quick, sir?

Did it in a tick, sir,

Just like an elixir

Ought to do!



How about a bottle, mister?

Only costs a penny, guaranteed.



COMPANY:

Penny buys a bottle, I don't know

You don't need

Ah, let's go



Tobias:

Go ahead and tug, sir.

Go ahead, sir, harder.



Does Pirelli's

Stimulate the growth, sir?

You can have my oath, sir,

'Tis unique.

Rub a minute.

Stimulatin', in'it?

Soon you'll have to thin it

Once a week!



Gently dab it.

Gets to be a habit.

Soon there'll be enough, sir,

Somebody can grab it.

See that chap with

Hair like Shelley's?

You can tell 'e's

Used Pirelli's!



COMPANY:

Let me have a bottle,

Make that two!



Lovett:

Pardon me, sir, what's that awful stink?



Sweeney:

Smells to me like piss and looks like ink.



Tobias:

Buy Pirelli's

Miracle elixir

Anything wot's slick, sir,

Soon sprouts curls.

Try Pirelli's

When they see how thick, sir,

You can have your pick, sir,

Of the girls!



See Pirelli's

Miracle elixir

Grow a little wick, sir,

Then some fuzz.

The Pirelli's

Soon'll make it thick, sir,

Like a good elixir

Always does!



Trust Pirelli's

If your hair is sick, sir,

Fix it in a nick, sir,

Don't look grim.

Just Pirelli's

Miracle elixir,

That'll do the trick, sir



COMPANY:

What about the money?



Tobias:

If you've got a kick, sir



COMPANY:

What about the money?

Where is this Pirelli?

Go and get Pirelli!



Tobias(Simultaneously as next COMPANY line):

Tell it to the mixer

Of the miracle elixir

If you've got a kick, sir,



COMPANY:

What about our money?

Where is this Pirelli?
