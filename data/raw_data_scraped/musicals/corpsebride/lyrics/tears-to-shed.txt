Tears to Shed


MAGGOT

What does that whispy little brat have that you don't have double?



BLACK WIDOW

She can't hold a candle to the beauty of your smile



CORPSE BRIDE

How about a pulse?



MAGGOT

Overrated by a mile



BLACK WIDOW

Overbearing



MAGGOT

Overblown



MAGGOT AND BLACK WIDOW

If he only knew the you that we know



CORPSE BRIDE

(sigh)



BLACK WIDOW

And that silly little creature isn't wearing his ring



MAGGOT

And she doesn't play piano



MAGGOT AND BLACK WIDOW

Or dance



MAGGOT

Or sing



MAGGOT AND BLACK WIDOW

No she doesn't compare



CORPSE BRIDE

But she still breathes air



BLACK WIDOW

Who cares?



MAGGOT

Unimportant



BLACK WIDOW

Overrated



MAGGOT

Overblown



MAGGOT AND BLACK WIDOW

If only he could see

How special you can be

If he only knew the you that we know



CORPSE BRIDE

If I touch a burning candle I can feel no pain

If you cut me with a knife it's still the same

And I know her heart is beating

And I know that I am dead

Yet the pain here that I feel

Try and tell me it's not real

For it seems that I still have a tear to shed



MAGGOT

The sure redeeming feature

From that little creature

Is that she's alive



BLACK WIDOW

Overrated



MAGGOT

Overblown



BLACK WIDOW

Everybody know that's just a temporary state

Which is cured very quickly when we meet our fate



MAGGOT

Who cares?



BLACK WIDOW

Unimportant



MAGGOT

Overrated



BLACK WIDOW

Overblown



MAGGOT AND BLACK WIDOW

If only he could see

How special you can be

If he only knew the you that we know



CORPSE BRIDE

If I touch a burning candle I can feel no pain

In the ice or in the sun it's all the same

Yet I feel my heart is aching

Though it doesn't beat it's breaking

And the pain here that I feel

Try and tell me it's not real

I know that I am dead

Yet it seems that I still have some tears to shed
