According to Plan


Mrs. VanDort

It's a beautiful day.



Mr. VanDort

It's a rather nice day.



Mrs. VanDort

A day for a glorious wedding.



Mr. VanDort

A rehearsal, my dear, to be perfectly clear.



Mrs. VanDort

A rehearsal for a glorious wedding.



Mr. VanDort

Assuming nothing happens that we don't really know,



Mrs. VanDort

That nothing unexpected interferes with the show.



Mr. And Mrs. VanDort

And that's why everything, every last little thing,

every single tiny microscopic little thing must go...



Mrs. VanDort

According to plan,



Mr. VanDort

Our son will be married.



Mrs. VanDort

According to plan,



Mr. VanDort

Our family carried,



Mr. And Mrs. VanDort

We'll go right into to the heights of society...



Mrs. VanDort

To the costume balls,



Mr. VanDort

In the hallowed halls.



Mrs. VanDort

Rubbing elbows with the finest.



Mr. VanDort

Having crumpets with her highness.



Mr. And Mrs. VanDort

We'll be there, we'll be seen, having tea with the queen.

We'll forget everything...that we've ever ever been.



Mrs. Everglot

It's a terrible day



Mr. Everglot

Now don't be that way



Mrs. Everglot

It's a terrible day for a wedding.



Mr. Everglot

It's a sad, sad state of affairs we're in,



Mrs. Everglot

That has led to this ominous wedding.



Mr. Everglot

How could our family have come to this?



Mr. and Mrs. Everglot

To marry off our daughter to the noveaux-rich.



Mrs. Everglot

They're so common,



Mr. Everglot

So coarse.



Mrs. Everglot

Oh, it couldn't be worse!



Mr. Everglot

It couldn't be worse? I'm afraid I disagree.

It could be land-rich bankrupt aristocracy,

without a penny to their name...just like you...and me.



Mrs. Everglot

Oh, dear.



Mr. and Mrs. Everglot

And that's why everything, every last little thing,

every single tiny microscopic little thing must go...



Mrs. Everglot

According to plan,



Mr. Everglot

Our daughter will wed.



Mrs. Everglot

According to plan,



Mr. Everglot

Our family lead,



Mr. and Mrs. Everglot

From the depths of deepest poverty,



Mrs. Everglot

To the noble realm,



Mr. Everglot

Of our ancestors.



Mr. and Mrs. Everglot

And who'd have guessed in a million years that our daughter, with the face



Mr. Everglot

of an otter in disgrace,



Mr. and Mrs. Everglot

Would provide our ticket to our rightful place?



Victoria (speaking)

What if Victor and I don't...like each other?



Mrs. Everglot (speaking)

Do you suppose your father and I like each other?



Victoria (speaking)

Surely you must...a little...



Mr. and Mrs. Everglot (speaking)

Of course not!



Mrs. Everglot (speaking)

Get those corsets laced properly...I can hear you speak without gasping.

Marriage is a partnership. A little tit-for-tat.

You'd think a lifetime watching us (singing) might have taught her that.

Might have taught her that.



Mr. Everglot

Everything must be perfect



Mrs. Everglot

Everything must be perfect



Mr. Everglot

Everything must be perfect



Mr. and Mrs. Everglot

Everything must be perfect, perfect,



The VanDorts and the Everglots

That's why everything, every last little thing,

every single tiny microscopic little thing must go...According to plan!
