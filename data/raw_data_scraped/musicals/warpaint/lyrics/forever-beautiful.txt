Forever Beautiful




HELENA RUBINSTEIN (speaking):

These portraits... they trap me in amber. They will not age. They will live forever.



(singing)

My Dali dear,

That mad surrealist,

He made me beautiful

Forever Beautiful

My eyes like gems,

Notice, please, each tiny lash

Would you believe he painted with his own mustache?



Raoul Dufy,

A brilliant colorist

He made me beautiful

Forever Beautiful

A few deft strokes

Poppy red and iris blue

In my small way I do know something of this too



Made women glorious

Made women glamorous

Used all my art to halt the march of time

I slowed it down a bit,

There is no stopping it,

But in a painting it is always your prime

Right?



Tamara de Lempicka

She was bisexual

You see her love for me,

But it's sub-textual

My lifelong fight

Is to keep my figure trim

But now I eat 'cause Giacometti keeps me slim



MAN #1 (speaking):

Seven guest rooms. When was the last time she even had a visitor?



MAN #2 (speaking):

She's old, and scared.



MAN #1 (speaking):

Wouldn't you be?



HELENA RUBINSTEIN (singing):

Good, go then, you money men

I read your beady eyes:

'Vain old lady all alone

In bed until she dies'



I admit,

I am a little bit afraid to meet death,

But with brilliant eye for art,

When I depart,

I'll cheat death



With my Picasso

His early cubist years

I posed no clothes with him,

Thank God, who knows with him?

He says 'Your ears are like elephant in size'

I say from you, well, who can tell from ears or eyes?



When I was girl of eight,

My papa sneered at me

A plainer face he'd never seen before

I said to hell with fate,

I'll mold my destiny,

Packed my satchel and walked right out the door



From discontented life

Without a cent I was

Became a name the world could not ignore



I reinvent my life

As every artist does

I had nothing

I knew nothing

I only know there must be something more

So much more



Look at them all

Their light will never dim

If death should come for me,

They bar the door on him

Though flesh may fade,

Canvas lives immortally,

And there I'll hang from now through all eternity



Who gives a damn?

No children visit me

These are my progeny

Each an exquisite me



Who says I'm old?

I look at my life so far

And I am beautiful

And I feel beautiful

Forever beautiful

When you feel beautiful,

You are
