Face to Face




Helena:

Will I ever escape my shadow?

Still attached as we always were

Her my nemesis and my life long rival

Now we're fighting the world for our survival

Do I dare to breach the wall of silence?

This insanity has brought us both disgrace!

There's so much I would wish to ask her

For who better to appreciate my case

Reveal what's real beneath the War Paint

Just us two

Talking Face to Face



Elizabeth:

Why endeavor to end this standoff?

I have nothing to learn from her

She my enemy and my would be equal

Dueling actresses in our haunting sequel

Though if only we could pool our knowledge

Make an armistice and hold the fort in place

With chaos reigning down upon us

Could we reach beyond the mirror and time and space

And wipe away the mask of makeup?

Just us two talking face to face



Helena:

Does she ever stare through empty air all weak and lonely?

Regret how we came to share each others one and only?



Elizabeth:

Does she know how good I think she is enough to goad me?

Forget how I overcame the obstacles life showed me

Or why I moved mountains?



Helena:

Or why I crossed oceans?



Both:

Or put my ambitions above my emotions?

The day I decided I would live a life, life owed me, owed me!



Helena:

And yet even so



Elizabeth:

Yet even so



Both:

One wonders you know...



Elizabeth:

Which impressionist is her favorite?



Helena:

Which french perfume does she prefer?



Elizabeth:

Could we possibly ever bridge the distance?



Helena:

Fight united for once in coexistence?



Both:

Far to often and to (?man defences?)

Too competitive to ever win the race



Helena:

We cling to our instinctive grudges



Elizabeth:

Like to horses in an endless steeplechase



Both:

Or wipe away the mask of makeup



Elizabeth:

Just to talk



Helena:

Not to spar



Elizabeth:

Man to man



Helena:

Queen to Queen



Both:

On a par, in our fall from grace

As we all, start to stare

Standing Face to Face
