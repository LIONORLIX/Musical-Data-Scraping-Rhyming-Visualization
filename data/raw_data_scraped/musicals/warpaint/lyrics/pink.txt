Pink




ELIZABETH ARDEN (speaking):

Is that all I'm worth to them? A color?



(singing)

Pink

Is that my only claim to fame?

Pink

My shot at permanent acclaim

Pink

My legend branded with a rose

Immortalized in Posy Pink



On Mamie Eisenhower's Lips

Pink

On Mrs. Astor's roots and tips

Pink

The boxes packaged with a bow

That cost more than the lotion



Pink

That flush of ardor in a man's embrace

My would be baby with a rosy face

And rabbits from the test

Who perished for a nursery converted to a guest room

Dressed in Pink



With an enormous princess bed

Pink

The cherubs painted overhead in Pink

Coral Pink

Just Pink.



(spoken)

The undersigned hereby agrees to licence her likeness and trademark color...



(humming)



(singing)

When I was just a farm girl in Ontario

Could anyone have known how far I'd climb?

A multi-millionairess not so long ago

The derby winning cover-girl of Time



A confident to presidents and royalty

Her generation's connoisseur of style

In years to come I wonder how they'll picture me

A legend, or some aging erstwhile juvenile in Pink



Still the eternal debutante

Pink

The only shred of me they want

Pink

My one accomplishment to last

When I'm put out to pasture



Pink

Pink

Oh is pink

My shoes my furniture my clothes

My life, la vie en rose, oh

Pink

The glint of sunrise on a frozen pond

The glow of twilight through the dark beyond

The pink rinse of my coif

Reclining on the matching satin lining of my coffin

Swathed in Pink



My life's work withered on the vine

Pink

All for a document to sign

In Pink ink.



Fuchsia pink.



Persian pink.



Peachy pink.



Mocha pink, timeless pink, story pink, fabled pink, glory pink, label pink.



Arden Pink.



(speaking)

Well I never even liked the color.
