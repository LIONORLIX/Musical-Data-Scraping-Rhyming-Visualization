Better Yourself


ELIZABETH ARDEN:



(speaking)



You have the power to reinvent yourself and become anything you'd like to be.

The first step? Your appearance.



(singing)



Look at your face

See your mistake

Not an enticing effect to be icing your face like a cake



Liable to smudge the collar of a man

Young lady

Better yourself to be the best that you can



Look at your dress

Quite a design

Waving your asset in public is tacit to wearing a sign:

'Open for business, taking checks or cash'

But once you better yourself

You won't be taken for trash



You can look as la-dee-da

As any heiress with a rich papa

You just convey that certain

Je ne sais quoi



(speaking)



Now if you'll excuse me, I've mountains to climb!



(singing)



Poor little kid

Wanting in charm

You know the kind as demure and refined as a fire alarm

Somehow she makes me cry beneath my smile



Of course I've met her myself

That young go-getter; myself

And maybe better myself

Before I bettered myself

With all this style
