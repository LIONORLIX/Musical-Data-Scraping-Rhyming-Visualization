Morning Anthem


[PEACHUM]

Wake up, all you godless, wake up

Come open your sinful blue eyes

With greed runneth over your cup

So start the day's blessings and lies

Sell him out, your own brother, you lout

And chuck your poor mother about

The good Lord up above you is watching

And yelling "Get up and get out!"
