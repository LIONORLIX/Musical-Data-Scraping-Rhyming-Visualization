How to Survive


[MACHEATH]

Now those among you full of pious teaching

Who teach us to renounce the major sins

Should know before you do your heavy preaching

Our middle's empty, there it all begins

Your vices and our virtues are so dear to you

So learn the simple truth from this our song

Wherever you aspire, whatever you may do

First feed the face, and then talk right and wrong

For even honest folk may act like sinners

Unless they've had their customary dinners



[WOMAN]

What keeps a man alive?



[MACHEATH]

What keeps a man alive? He lives on others

He likes to taste the first, then eat them whole if he can

(spoken)

Forgets that they're supposed to be his brothers

(sung)

That he himself was ever called a man



[ENSEMBLE]

Remember if you wish to stay alive

For once do something bad and you'll survive!



[MRS. PEACHUM]

You warn us with appropriate caresses

That virtue, humble virtue always wins

Now please, before your moral fervor presses

Our middle's empty, there it all begins

Oh, you who dote on our despair and your desire

May learn the simple truth from this our song

Whatever you may do, whatever you aspire

First feed the face, and then talk right and wrong

For even saintly folk may act like sinners

Unless they've had their customary dinners



[MAN]

What keeps a man alive?



[MRS. PEACHUM]

What keeps a man alive? He lives on others

He likes to taste the first, then eat them whole if he can

Forgets that they're supposed to be his brothers

That he himself was ever called a man



[ENSEMBLE]

Remember if you wish to stay alive

For once do something bad and you'll survive!
