Useless Song


[PEACHUM]

If first you don't succeed

Then try and try again

And if you don't succeed again

Just try and try and try

Useless, it's useless

Our kind of life's too tough

Take it from me, it's useless

Trying ain't enough



Since people ain't much good

Just hit 'em on the hood

But though you hit 'em good and hard

They're never out for good

Useless, it's useless

Even when you're playing rough

Take it from me, it's useless

You're never rough enough
