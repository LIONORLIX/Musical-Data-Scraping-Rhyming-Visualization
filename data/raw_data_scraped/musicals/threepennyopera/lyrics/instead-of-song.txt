Instead Of Song


[PEACHUM]

Instead of, instead of

Staying home in bed at night behaving



[MRS. PEACHUM]

They want love, they want love

Chasing up the alley with a sentimental craving



[PEACHUM & MRS. PEACHUM]

They got those "Moon over Dock Street"

They got the "You feel my heart beating" blues

They got that "Anywhere you go, I will go with you"

For that old fashioned love tickle still makes news



[MRS. PEACHUM]

Instead of, instead of

Going about their business and behaving



[PEACHUM]

They make love, they make love

'Til the man is through and she is sorry that she gave in



[PEACHUM & MRS. PEACHUM]

Now where's your "Moon over Dock Street"?

What happened to the "You feel my heart beating" blues?

Where is that "Anywhere you go, I will go with you"?

Call that old fashioned love tickle last year's news
