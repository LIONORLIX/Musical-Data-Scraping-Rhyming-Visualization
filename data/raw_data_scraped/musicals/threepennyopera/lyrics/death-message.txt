Death Message


[MACHEATH]

Oh brothers who live on when we are dead

Let not your noble hearts against us harden

And smile not when the news shall claim our head

A silly secret smile to ease your burden

Nor rail against us now you see us broken

Nor take revenge upon us, like the law

Not all of us treat virtue with such awe

Oh brothers, being light of heart, be shaken

Oh brothers, make our fate a lesson be

And beg of God that h? will pardon me



And luscious girls who flaunt their treasur?

Before the eyes of easy yokels

And other men who wait at leisure

To watch and snatch their simple shackles

The crooks, the molls, the flesh house owners

The shills by day and sharks by night

And yes, those dogs in uniform

May I be guiltless in their sight

May heavy hatchets hit their faces

And smash them in for all to see

Now I forget their filthy faces

And beg them all to pardon me
