The Ballad of Mack the Knife


[BALLAD SINGER]

Oh, the shark has pretty teeth, dear

And he shows them pearly white

Just a jackknife has Macheath, dear

And he keeps it out of sight



When the shark bites with his teeth, dear

Scarlet billows start to spread

Fancy gloves, though, wears Macheath, dear

So there's not a trace of red



On the sidewalk Sunday morning

Lies a body oozing life

Someone's sneaking 'round the corner

Is the someone Mack the Knife?



From a tugboat by the river

A cement bag's dropping down

The cement's just for the weight, dear

Bet you Mackie's back in town



Louie Miller disappeared, dear

After drawing out his cash

And Macheath spends like a sailor

Did our boy do something rash?



Sukey Tawdry, Jenny Diver

Polly Peachum, Lucy Brown

Oh, the line forms on the right, dears

Now that Mackie's back in town



Oh, the shark has pretty teeth, dear

And he shows them pearly white

Just a jackknife has Macheath, dear

And he keeps it out of sight

Just a jackknife has Macheath, dear

And he keeps it



[VOICE]

Look, there goes Mack the Knife



[BALLAD SINGER]

Out of sight
