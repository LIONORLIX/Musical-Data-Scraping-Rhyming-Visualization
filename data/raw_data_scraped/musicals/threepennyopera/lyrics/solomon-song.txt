Solomon Song


[JENNY]

Remember wise old Solomon

Recall his history

He was the wisest man on earth

And so he cursed the day of his birth

He knew that all is vanity

So not much fun

Had Solomon

Now most of?us?might?agree

We are much?better off than?he

His brains it was that put him on the spot

I thought that brains were good

Guess not



Remember Julius Caesar's fame

Recall his destiny

Of all the dogs, top dog was he

But his best friends did him in thoroughly

And all because top dog was he

He screamed en route

"Et tu, ya brut?!"

I hope you've got the moral now

But I'll sp?ll if for you anyhow

His high position put him on the spot

Is it worth it to be top dog?

Guess not



Into the fire has our Macheath

Leapt from the frying pan

While he was tough and used his sense

He remained the pride of swindler and fence

Was every cutie's promised man

Then the poor dope

Went soft as soap

Forgot the things that he had won

He trusted us and was undone

His melting heart, it put him on the spot

I was thinking about reforming

Guess not
