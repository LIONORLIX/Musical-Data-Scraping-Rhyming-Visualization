[LUCY]

I used to believe, in the days I was pure

And I was pure, like you used to be

My wonderful someone will come to me someday

And then, it will all depend on me

If he's a fine man, if he's a rich man

Wears a fine cravat, smokes a cigar

And if he's gallant and treats me like a lady

Then I shall tell him: "Sorry"

Chin up high, keep your powder dry

Don't relax or go too far

Look, the moon is gonna shine 'til dawn

Keep the little rowboat cruising on and on

You stay perpendicular



Oh, you can't just let a man walk over you

Cold and dignifi?d is what you are

Such a whole lot of things can happen

So firmly say, but sweetly: "Sorry"



On? day comes a man, but what kind of a man?

Do you know why he does what he does?

He walked into my room and he hung up his hat

And I just didn't know where I was

He was a lean man, he was a mean man

He didn't own a cravat, smoked no cigar

And God knows he never made me feel a lady

There just wasn't time for: "Sorry"

Chin up high? My chin was down my shoes

And I relaxed, but far too far

Oh, the way the moon kept shining on

The night was nice for rowing and this girl was gone

Not so perpendicular



So you let a man just walk right over you

Who said dignified is what you are?

Such a wonderful lot of terrible things did happen

And now it's you can tell me: "Sorry"
