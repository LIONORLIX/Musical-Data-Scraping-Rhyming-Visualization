Tango Ballad


[MACHEATH]

There was a time, and now it's all gone by

When we two lived together, she and I

The way we were was just the way to be

I cared for her, and she took care of me

And that arrangement seemed to work perfectly

The milkman rang the bell, I got out of bed

I opened up her purse, paid him what he said

I'd have a glass of milk, back in bed I'd climb

You understand, she was out working all this time

And so we lived, me and my little mouse

In that snug two-by-four where we kept house



[JENNY]

That was a time, and now it's all gone by

When we were poor but happy, he and I

But when the day would bring no job to me

He'd curse and say, "How lazy can you be?"

I let him huff and puff; I worked long enough

But when he drank too much I'd get kind of grim

And shout the house down how I stood a clown like him

And then he'd turn around and try to bite my arm

And I would kick him in the teeth, meaning no harm

It was so sweet to be his little spouse

In that foul two-by-four where we played house



[MACHEATH & JENNY]

Oh happy time, and now it's all gone by

Until we quit each other, you and I



[JENNY]

You stayed in bed all day, and don't you smirk



[MACHEATH]

You know we said that you'd do all the work

Now sleep's for the night they say; it ain't bad by day



[JENNY]

So then I had my fiddles so I wouldn't stir



[MACHEATH]

It looked like soon I might be taking care of her



[JENNY]

You'd think a woman had a right to have one gripe

You left me flat



[MACHEATH]

Well I just ain't the working type



[MACHEATH & JENNY]

We locked the door and each commenced to roam

Goodbye sweet two-by-four that we called home
