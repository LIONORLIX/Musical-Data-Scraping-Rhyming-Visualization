Jealousy Duet


[LUCY]

Come on out, you gutter-lily you

Show your legs, and let's all see how pretty

I'm always glad to admire beauty

They're the thickest ankles in the city



[POLLY, spoken]

Ah!



[LUCY]

You thought you could make a big impression on my Mackie



[POLLY]

Didn't I? Didn't I?



[LUCY]

Guess you never met his old friend Jackie



[POLLY]

Didn't I? Didn't I?



[LUCY]

Well, you kind of make me laugh



[POLLY]

Well, I kind of make you laugh



[LUCY]

Who would want a stupid calf?



[POLLY]

Who would want what stupid calf?



[LUCY]

Ha, now there's a leg for you

So Mackie needn't beg for you



[POLLY]

Well you better ask him



[LUCY]

Yes you better ask him



[POLLY]

You had better ask him



[LUCY]

You had better ask him

Ha, ha, ha, ha, ah ha



[POLLY & LUCY]

Macki? and me, I always knew he'd choos? me

Mackie and me, and he will never lose me

He's not in any danger

From some threepenny stranger

He'd leave me for a stranger?

Laughable!

[POLLY]

Yes, they call me beauty of the town

See my legs, and say "Now those are pretty"

I'm glad you're glad to admire beauty

Note the trimmest ankle in the city



[LUCY, spoken]

Go peddle your wares somewhere else



[POLLY]

I knew I would make a big impression on my Mackie



[LUCY]

Oh, did you? Did you?



[POLLY]

You'd be pleased to know I've met his Jackie



[LUCY]

Have you? Have you?



[POLLY]

Well you kind of make me laugh



[LUCY]

Now I kind of make you laugh?

[POLLY]

Who would want a big giraffe?



[LUCY]

Who would want what big giraffe?



[POLLY]

Ha ha ha, you are so pitiful

Imagining you're beautiful



[LUCY]

Bet you wouldn't ask him



[POLLY]

Certainly I'll ask him



[LUCY]

Go on then, ask him



[POLLY]

You'd better ask him

Ah ha, ah ha, ah ha, ah ha, ah ha



[POLLY & LUCY]

Mackie and me, he never could refuse me

Mackie and me, and he will never lose me



[POLLY]

He likes a nice petite girl



[LUCY]

He likes a big complete girl



[POLLY & LUCY]

Him leave me for a street girl?

Asinine!
