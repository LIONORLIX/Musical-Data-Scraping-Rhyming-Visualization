Melodrama/Pollyâ€™s Song


[POLLY, spoken]

It lasted so short a time, Mack.



[MACHEATH, spoken]

Is it over, then?



[POLLY, spoken]

Last night, I had a dream. I was looking out the window, and I heard someone laughing in the alley. And when I looked, I saw our moon. Only it was a pale, thin moon, like a worn-out old penny. Don't forget me, Mack, in foreign lands.



[MACHEATH, spoken]

I swear I'll never forget you. Kiss me, Polly.



[POLLY, spoken]

Goodbye, Mack.



[MACHEATH, spoken]

Goodbye, Polly.



[POLLY, spoken]

And he will never come back again. The Queen is preparin' to drive down London Way. Where will we all be on Coronation Day?

(sung)

Sweet while it lasted

And now it is over

Tear out your heart

Say "Goodby?, my lover"

What good is my weeping

Blessed Virgin, oh h?ar me

When even my own mother

Knew it all before me



[MACHEATH, offstage]

Who knows how to make love stay?
