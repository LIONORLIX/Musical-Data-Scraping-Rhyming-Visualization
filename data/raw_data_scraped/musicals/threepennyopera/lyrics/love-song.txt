Love Song


[MACHEATH, spoken]

You see the moon over Dock Street?



[POLLY]

I see it, dearest.

You feel me heart beating, beloved?



[MACHEATH, spoken]

I feel it, beloved.



[POLLY, spoken]

Anywhere you go I will go with you.



[MACHEATH]

You go with me, then I won't go anywhere.



[MACHEATH & POLLY]

No papers or licenses seal our troth

No floral wreaths or garlands are there

Who paid for your (my) bridal gown?

I ask us both

And where is the veil for your (my) hair?

Oh drink, let us drink one more drink from the glass

And then fling it down while we may

For love lives evermore, or love will pass

Who knows how to mak? love stay?
