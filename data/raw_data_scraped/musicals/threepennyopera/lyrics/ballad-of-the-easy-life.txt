Ballad of the Easy Life


[MACHEATH, spoken]

A question please: Is that what you call living? Then take a little tip from Mack the Knife. While still a child, I heard it with misgiving: the bulging pocket makes the easy life.

(sung)

They tell you that the best in life is mental

Just starve yourself and do a lot of reading

Up in some garret where the rats are breeding

Should you survive, it's purely accidental

If that's your pleasure, go on, live that way

But since I've had it up to here, I'm through

There's not a dog from here to Timbuktu

Would care to live that life a single day

So listen closely to Mack the Knife

The bulging pocket makes the easy life



Now once I used to think it might be worthy

To be a brave and sacrificing person

I soon found out it wasn't reimbursin'

Decided to continue being earthy

The noble poor are nobly underfed

And being brave will bring an empty fame

You're all alone with no one else to blame

You're mingling with the great but you are dead

Where's the percentage? Ask Mack the Knife

The bulging pocket makes the easy life
