Without You


Eliza (singing):

What a fool I was, what dominated fool,

to think that you were the earth and the sky,

What a fool I was, What an elevated fool,

What a mutton-headed dote was I!

No, my reverberated friend,

you are not the beginning and the end.



Professor Higgins (speaking):

You impetant hussy there's not an idea in your head or a word in your mouth that I haven't put there.



Eliza (singing):

There'll be spring every year without you. England still will be here without you.

There'll be fruit on the tree.

And a shore by the sea.

There'll be crumpets and tea without you.



Art and music will thrive without you. Somehow Keats will survive without you.

And there still will be rain on that plain down in Spain,

even that will remain without you.

I can do without you.



You, dear friend, who taught so well,

You can go to Hartford, Hereford and Hampshire.



They can still rule with land without you.

Windsor Castle will stand without you.

And without much ado we can all muddle through without you.



Professor Higgins:

You brazen hussy,



Eliza (singing):

Wihtout pulling it the tide comes in,

without your twirling it the Earth can spin,

Without your pulling it, the tide comes in

Without your twirling it, the earth can spin

Without your pushing them, the clouds roll by,

If they can do without you, ducky, so can I

I shall not feel alone without you

I can stand on my own without you

So go back in your shell

I can do bloody well

Without...



Professor Higging (singing) interupts:

By George, I really did it,

I did it, I did it,

I said I'd make a woman and indeed I did,

I knew that I could do it,

I knew it, I knew it,

I said I'd make a woman and succeed I did!



(speaking)

Eliza you are wonderful
