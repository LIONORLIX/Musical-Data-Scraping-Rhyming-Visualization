Why Can't the English?


Higgins:

Look at her, a prisoner of the gutter,

Condemned by every syllable she utters.

By right she should be taken out and hung,

For the cold-blooded murder of the English tongue.



Eliza:

Aaoooww!



Higgins:

Aaoooww!

Heavens, what a noise!

This is what the British population,

Calls an elementary education.



Pickering:

Come, sir, I think you picked a poor example.



Higgins:

Did I?

Hear them down in Soho square,

Dropping "h's" everywhere.

Speaking English anyway they like.

You sir, did you go to school?



Man:

Wadaya tike me for, a fool?



Higgins:

No one taught him 'take' instead of 'tike'!



Hear a Yorkshireman, or worse,

Hear a Cornishman converse,

I'd rather hear a choir singing flat.

Chickens cackling in a barn,

Just like this one here.



Eliza:

Garn!



Higgins:

I ask you, sir, what sort of word is that?



It's "Aaoooww" and "Garn" that keep her in her place.

Not her wretched clothes and dirty face.



Why can't the English teach their children how to speak?

This verbal class distinction, by now,

Should be antique.

If you spoke as she does, sir,

Instead of the way you do,

Why, you might be selling flowers, too!



Pickering:

I beg your pardon!



Higgins: An Englishman's way of speaking absolutely classifies him.

The moment he talks he makes some other Englishman despise him.

One common language I'm afraid we'll never get,

Oh, why can't the English learn to



set a good example to people whose

English is painful to your ears?

The Scots and the Irish leave you close to tears.

There even are places where English completely disappears.



In America, they haven't used it for years!



Why can't the English teach their children how to speak?

Norwegians learn Norwegian,

the Greeks are taught their Greek.

In France every Frenchman knows his language from "A" to "Zed"



The French never care what they do, actually, as long as they pronounce it properly.



Arabians learn Arabian with the speed of summer lightning,

The Hebrews learn it backwards,

which is absolutely frightening.

But use proper English and you're regarded as a freak.



Why can't the English,

Why can't the English,

Learn To Speak?
