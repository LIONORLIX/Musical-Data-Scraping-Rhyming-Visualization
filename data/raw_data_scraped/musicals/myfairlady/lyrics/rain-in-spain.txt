Rain in Spain


Servants Poor Professor Higgins!

Poor Professor Higgins! Night and day

He slaves away! Oh, poor Professor Higgins!

All day long On his feet; Up and down until he's numb;

Doesn't rest; Doesn't eat;

Doesn't touch a crumb! Poor Professor Higgins!

Poor Professor Higgins! On he plods Against all odds;

Oh, poor Professor Higgins! Nine p.m. Ten p.m.

On through midnight ev'ry night.

One a.m. Two a.m. Three...! Quit, Professor Higgins!

Quit, Professor Higgins! Hear our plea

Or payday we Will quit, Professor Higgins!

Ay not I, O not Ow, Pounding pounding in our brain.

Ay not I, O not Ow, Don't say "Rine," say "Rain"...



Eliza

The rain in Spain stays mainly in the plain!

Henry By George, she's got it! By George, she's got it!

Now, once again where does it rain? Eliza On the plain!

On the plain! Henry And where's that soggy plain?

Eliza In Spain! In Spain! The three

The rain in Spain stays mainly in the plain!

The rain in Spain stays mainly in the plain! Henry

In Hartford, Hereford, and Hampshire...?

Eliza Hurricanes hardly happen.

How kind of you to let me come! Henry

Now once again, where does it rain?

Eliza On the plain! On the plain! Henry

And where's that blasted plain?

Eliza In Spain! In Spain! The three

The rain in Spain stays mainly in the plain!

The rain in Spain stays mainly in the plain!
