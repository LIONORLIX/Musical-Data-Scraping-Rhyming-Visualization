You Did It


Pickering Tonight, old man, you did it!

You did it! You did it! You said that you would do it,

And indeed you did. I thought that you would rue it;

I doubted you'd do it. But now I must admit it

That succeed you did. You should get a medal

Or be even made a knight. Henry It was nothing.

Really nothing. Pickering All alone you hurdled

Ev'ry obstacle in sight. Henry Now, wait! Now, wait!

Give credit where it's due, A lot of the glory goes to you.

Pickering But you're the one who did it,

Who did it, who did it! As sturdy as Gibraltar,

Not a second did you falter. There's no doubt about it,

You did it! I must have aged a year tonight.

At times I thought I'd die of fright.

Never was there a momentary lull Henry

Shortly after we came in I saw at once we'd easily win;

And after that I found it deadly dull. Pickering

You should have heard the ooh's and ah's;

Ev'ry one wondering who she was. Henry

You'd think they'd never seen a lady before. Pickering

And when the Prince of Transylvania

Asked to meet her,

And gave his arm to lead her to the floor...! I said to him:

You did it! You did it! You did it!

They thought she was ecstatic

And so damned aristocratic,

And they never knew

That you

Did it! Henry Thank Heavens for Zoltan Karparthy.

If it weren't for him I would have died of boredom.

He was there, all right. And up to his old tricks.

Mrs. Pearce Karparthy? That dreadful Hungarian?

Was he there? Henry Yes.

That blackguard who uses the science of speech

More to blackmail and swindle than teach;

He made it the devilish business of his

"To find out who this Miss Doolittle is."

Ev'ry time we looked around

There he was, that hairy hound From Budapest.

Never leaving us alone, Never have I ever known

A ruder pest Fin'lly I decided it was foolish

Not to let him have his chance with her.

So I stepped aside and let him dance with her.

Oozing charm from ev'ry pore

He oiled his way around the floor.

Ev'ry trick that he could play,

He used to strip her mask away.

And when at last the dance was done,

He glowed as if he knew he'd won!

And with a voice to eager,

And a smile too broad, He announced to the hostess

That she was a fraud! Mrs. Pearce No!

Henry Ja wohl! Her English is too good, he said,

Which clearly indicates that she is foreign.

Whereas others are instructed in their native language

English people aren't.

And although she may have studied with an expert

Di'lectician and grammarian, I can tell that she was born

Hungarian! Not only Hungarian, but of royal blood,

she is a princess! Servants Congratulations,

Professor Higgins, For your glorious victory!

Congratulations, Professor Higgins!

You'll be mentioned in history! Rest of Servants

(Simultaneously) Congratulations, Professor Higgins!

For your glorious Victory! Congratulations,

Professor Higgins! Sing hail and hallelujah!

Ev'ry bit of credit For it all belongs to you!

Footman (Simultaneously with Rest of Servants)

This evening, sir, you did it! You did it! You did it!

You said that you would do it And indeed you did.

This evening, sir, you did it! You did it! You did it!

We know that we have said it,

But-you did it and the credit

For it all belongs to you!
