Just You Wait


Just you wait, 'enry 'iggins, just you wait!

You'll be sorry, but your tears'll be to late!

You'll be broke, and I'll have money;

Will I help you? Don't be funny!

Just you wait, 'enry 'iggins, just you wait!

Just you wait, 'enry 'iggins, till you're sick,

And you scream to fetch a doctor double-quick.

I'll be off a second later And go straight to the the-ater!

Oh ho ho, 'enry 'iggins, just you wait!

Ooooooh 'enry 'iggins!

Just you wait until we're swimmin' in the sea!

Ooooooh 'enry 'iggins!

And you get a cramp a little ways from me!

When you yell you're going to drown I'll get dressed

and go to town! Oh ho ho, 'enry 'iggins!

Oh ho ho, 'enry 'iggins! Just you wait!

One day I'll be famous! I'll be proper and prim;

Go to St. James so often I will call it St. Jim!

One evening the king will say:

"Oh, Liza, old thing,

I want all of England your praises to sing.

Next week on the twentieth of May

I proclaim Liza Doolittle Day!

All the people will celebrate the glory of you

And whatever you wish and want I gladly will do."

"Thanks a lot, King" says I, in a manner well-bred;

But all I want is 'enry 'iggins 'ead!"

"Done," says the King with a stroke.

"Guard, run and bring in the bloke!"

Then they'll march you, 'enry 'iggins to the wall;

And the King will tell me: "Liza, sound the call."

As they lift their rifles higher, I'll shout:

"Ready! Aim! Fire!"

Oh ho ho, 'enry 'iggins,

Down you'll go, 'enry 'iggins!

Just you wait!
