Wouldn't It Be Loverly?


It's rather dull in town, I think I'll take me to Paree.

Mmmmmm.

The mistress wants to open up

The castle in Capri.

Me doctor recommends a quiet summer by the sea!

Mmmm, Mmmm, wouldn't it be loverly?

Eliza

All I want is a room somewhere,

Far away from the cold night air.

With one enormous chair,

Aow, wouldn't it be loverly?

Lots of choc'lates for me to eat,

Lots of coal makin' lots of 'eat.

Warm face, warm 'ands, warm feet,

Aow, wouldn't it be loverly?

Aow, so loverly sittin' abso-bloomin'-lutely still.

I would never budge 'till spring

Crept over me windowsill.

Someone's 'ead restin' on my knee,

Warm an' tender as 'e can be. 'ho takes good care of me,

Aow, wouldn't it be loverly?

Loverly, loverly, loverly, loverly
