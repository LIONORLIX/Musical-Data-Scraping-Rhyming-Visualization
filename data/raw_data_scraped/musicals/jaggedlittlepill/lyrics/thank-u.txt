Thank U


[Chorus]

How about me not blaming you for everything?

I'm reaching out to make amends



How about me?enjoying?a moment for?once?

No pressure for you to let?me in



[FRANKIE]

How about how good it feels to finally forgive you?



[Chorus]

These are no times for the weak of heart

One step, one prayer, I soldier on



Thank you, frailty

Thank you, providence

Thank you, disillusionment



Thank you, clarity

Thank you, consequence

Thank you, thank you silence



The moment I let go it

Was the moment I got more than I could handle

The moment I jumped off of it

Was the moment I touched down



Thank you for seeing me

Thank you for getting me



I see you
