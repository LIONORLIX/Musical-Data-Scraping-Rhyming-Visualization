Uninvited


[MARY JANE]

Like anyone would be

I am disturbed by my fascination with you

Like any flesh and a?human

I?have simply found?an object to crave



But you, you're?not allowed

You're uninvited

An unfortunate slight



[MARY JANE AND BELLA]

Must be strangely exciting

To watch the stoic squirm

Must be somewhat heartening

To watch the flawless fall from grace



[MARY JANE]

But you, you're not allowed

You're uninvited

An unfortunate slight



[MARY JANE AND BELLA]

Like any uncharted territory

This must seem greatly intriguing

You speak of my want like

You have experienced want like mine before



[MARY JANE]

But this is not allowed

You're uninvited

An unfortunate slight



Though, I found this unnerving

I've had my moment to deliberate
