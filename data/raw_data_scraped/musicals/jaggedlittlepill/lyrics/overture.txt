Overture


[Chorus]

Swallow it down

(What a jagged little pill)



It feels so good

(Swimming in your stomach)



What goes around?never?comes around

Wake up



And?all I really want

Is deliverance

A way?to calm the angry voice



These are my words

This is my voice

This is my taste of which you have no part of



(you, you, you, you, you...)

And I'm here to remind you

Of the mess you left when you went away



It's not fair to deny me

Of the cross I bear that you gave to me



You

You

You

You...
