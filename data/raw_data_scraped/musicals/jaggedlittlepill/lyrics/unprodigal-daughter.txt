Unprodigal Daughter


[FRANKIE]

I had disengaged to avoid being totaled

I would run away and say good riddance soon?enough

I?had grown disgusted?by your small-minded ceiling

To imagining myself?bolting had not been difficult



Soon be my life

Soon be my pace

Soon be my choice of which you'll have no part of



Unprodigal Daughter heading out onto my quest

Disenchanted daughter and this train cannot move fast enough

Unencumbered daughter hit the ground running at last!

I'd invite you but I'm busy being unoppressed



[FRANKIE AND Chorus]

One day I'll saddle back and speak foreign adventures

One day I'll double back and tell you about these unfettered years

One day I'll look back and feel something other than relieved

Glad that I left when I did, I know you

You can't get the best of me



[FRANKIE]

When I'd speak of artistry you would roll your eyes skyward

When I'd speak of spirituality you label me absurd

When I spoke of possibility you would frown and shake your head

If I had stayed much longer I'd have surely imploded



These are my words

This is my house

These are my friends of which you've had no part of



Unprodigal Daughter heading out onto my quest

Disenchanted daughter and this train cannot move fast enough

Unencumbered daughter hit the ground running at last!



[FRANKIE AND Chorus]

I'd invite you but I'm busy being unoppressed

Being unoppressed

Being unoppressed

Being unoppressed
