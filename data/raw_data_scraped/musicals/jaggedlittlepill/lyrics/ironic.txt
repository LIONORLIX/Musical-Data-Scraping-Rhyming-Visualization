Ironic


[FRANKIE]

An old man turned 98

He won the lottery and died the next day

It's a black?fly?in your Chardonnay

It's?a death row pardon two minutes?too late

And isn't it ironic

Don't you think?



[MALE STUDENT, spoken]

Hold up, wait a second!

That's actually not ironic



[STUDENT, spoken]

Right

If we are using irony as defined in Greek tragedy, I don't see how, like, a fly in your beverage applies



[STUDENT, spoken]

That's not irony

That's just like shitty



[FRANKIE, spoken]

Can I please finish my piece?



[FRANKIE]

Mr. Play-It-Safe was afraid to fly

He packed his suitcase and kissed his kids good-bye

He waited his whole damn life to take that flight

And as the plane crashed down he thought, "Well isn't this nice"

And isn't it ironic



[STUDENT, spoken]

It's not though



[STUDENT, spoken]

It would be irony if the guy in the crash was like an airplane mechanic



[PHOENIX, spoken]

How 'bout you guys let her finish?



[FRANKIE]

It's like rain on your wedding day

It's a free ride when you've already paid

It's the good advice that you just didn't take

And who would've thought—it figures!



Well, life has a funny way



[PHOENIX]

Of sneaking up on you when you think everything's okay

And everything's going right



[FRANKIE]

And life has a funny way



[PHOENIX]

Of helping you out when you think everything's gone wrong

And everything blows up in your face



[FRANKIE]

It's a traffic jam when you're already late



[TEACHER]

It's a no-smoking sign on your cigarette break



[PHOENIX]

It's like ten thousand spoons when all you need is a knife



[FRANKIE]

It's like meeting the boy of my dreams

And then meeting his...



[PHOENIX - spoken]

I'm not seeing anyone...



[FRANKIE]

And isn't it ironic

Don't you think?



[FRANKIE & PHOENIX]

A little too ironic



[PHOENIX]

Yeah, I really do think



[FRANKIE & PHOENIX]

It's like rain on your wedding day

It's a free ride when you've already paid

It's the good advice that you just didn't take

And who would've thought—it figures!



[FRANKIE]

Well, life has a funny way



[PHOENIX]

Of sneaking up on you



[FRANKIE]

Yeah, life has a funny, funny way of helping you out



[FRANKIE & PHOENIX]

Helping you out
