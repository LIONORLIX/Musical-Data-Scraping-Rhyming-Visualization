Hand In My Pocket


[JO]

I'm broke, but I'm happy

I'm poor, but I'm kind

I'm short, but I'm healthy, yeah



I'm high,?but?I'm grounded

I'm sane,?but I'm overwhelmed

I'm lost, but I'm?hopeful, baby



And what it all comes down to

Is that everything's gonna be fine, fine, fine

'Cause I've got one hand in my pocket

And the other one is giving a high five



I feel drunk, but I'm sober

I'm young and misunderstood

I'm tired, but I'm working, yeah



I care, but I'm restless

I'm here, but I'm really gone

I'm right and I'm sorry, baby



And what it all comes down to

Is that everything's gonna be quite alright

'Cause I've got one hand in my pocket

And the other one is flicking a cigarette



And what it all comes down to

Is that I haven't got it all figured out just yet

But I've got one hand in my pocket

And the other one is giving a peace sign



I'm free, but I'm focused

I'm green, but I'm wise

I'm hard, but I'm friendly, baby



I'm sad, but I'm laughing

I'm brave, but I'm chicken shit

I'm sick, but I'm pretty, baby



[JO & FRANKIE]

And what it all boils down to

Is that no one's really got it figured out just yet

But I've got one hand in my pocket (one hand in my pocket)

And the other one is playing a piano



And what it all comes down to my friends, yeah

Is that everything is just fine, fine, fine

'Cause I've got one hand in my pocket

And the other one is hailing--

Shit



{JO - SPOKEN]

The bell can blow me!
