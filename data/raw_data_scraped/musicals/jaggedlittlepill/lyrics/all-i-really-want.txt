All I Really Want


[FRANKIE]

Do I stress you out?

My sweater's on backwards and inside out

And you say how appropriate?



[MARY JANE]

And?I'd?like to dissect?everything today

I don't mean to pick?you apart, you see

But I can't help it



[FRANKIE]

And there I go jumping before the gun shot has gone off

Slap me with a splintered ruler



And it would knock me to the floor if I wasn't there already

If only I could hunt the hunter



[MARY JANE and STEVE]

And all I really want

Is some patience

A way to calm the angry voice



[FRANKIE and ENSEMBLE]

And all I really want

Is deliverance

Ahh



[MARY JANE and (ENSEMBLE)]

Do I wear you out? (Do I wear you out)

You must wonder why I'm relentless and all strung out

I'm consumed by the chill of solitary (Ahh)



[FRANKIE and ENSEMBLE]

I'm like Estella

I like to reel it in



[FRANKIE and (ENSEMBLE)]

And then spit it out

I'm frustrated by your apathy (your apathy, your apathy..)



[FRANKIE]

And I am frightened by the corrupted ways of this land

If only I could meet the maker

And I am fascinated by the spiritual woman



[FRANKIE and ENSEMBLE]

I'm humbled by her humble nature (Yeah)

And what I wouldn't give to find a soul mate?

Someone else to catch this drift

And what I wouldn't give to meet a kindred?

Ahh



[FRANKIE]

Enough about me

Let's talk about you for a minute



[MARY JANE]

Enough about you

Let's talk about life for a while



[FRANKIE]

The conflicts



[MARY JANE]

The craziness



[ENSEMBLE]

And the sound of pretenses is falling

All around, all around



[FRANKIE]

Why are you so petrified of silence?

Here, can you handle this?



[FRANKIE] [ENSEMBLE]

Did you think about your bills Bills

Your pills Pills

Your deadlines Deadlines

Or when you think you're going to die? You're gonna die

Or did you long for the next distraction? Mmm..



And all I need now is intellectual intercourse Do do do...

A soul to dig the hole much deeper Oh oh oh



[STEVE]

And I have no concept of time Do do do...

Other than it is flying



[STEVE and ENSEMBLE]

If only I could kill the killer Ah ah ah..



[NICK]

And all I really want is some peace man

A place to find a common ground



[FRANKIE]

And all I really want is a wavelength

Ahhh



[MARY JANE and (ENSEMBLE)]

And all I really want is some comfort (Ohh)

A way to get my hands untied (Ohh)



[FRANKIE and (ENSEMBLE)]

And all I really want is some justice (Ohh)



[FRANKIE, MARY JANE & ENSEMBLE]

Ahh



[MARY JANE]

Ahhh

And all I really want is some patience

A way to calm me down



[FRANKIE]

And all I really want is deliverance

A way to find some common ground
