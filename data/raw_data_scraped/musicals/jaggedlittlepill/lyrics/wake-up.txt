Wake Up


[FRANKIE]

You like snow, but only if it's warm

You like rain, but only if it's dry

There's?no?sentimental value to?the rose that fell on the?floor

There's no fundamental excuse for the granted it's taken for

'Cause it's easy not to

So much easier not to

And what goes around never comes around to you

To you

To you...



[NICK]

I like pain but only if it doesn't hurt too much

Should I sit, should I wait, to receive



[Chorus]

There's an obvious attraction

To the path of least resistance in your life



[NICK]

Well, there's an obvious aversion no amount of your insistence

Could make me try tonight

But it's easy not to

So much easier not to

And what goes around never comes around to you



[NICK AND Chorus]

To you, to you, to you, to you, to you...



[Chorus]

Ooh, this could get messy

But you don't seem to mind...



[ANDREW]

Well, there's an apprehensive, naked, little trembling boy

With his head in his hands



[BELLA]

And there's an underestimated and impatient little girl

Raising her hand



[MARY JANE]

But it's easy not to



[MARY JANE AND STEVE]

So much easier not to



[Chorus]

And what goes around never comes around to you

To you, to you



Ooh this could get messy, but you don't seem to mind



Get up, get up, get up off of it

Get up, get up, get up off of it



And what goes around comes around to you



Wake up



Wake up...
