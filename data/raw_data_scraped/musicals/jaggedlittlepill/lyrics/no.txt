No


[BELLA]

My mind is invaded

My gates are ignored

My thoughts are negated

And you're on a roll



[Chorus]

And I?am?offended

By your acts?of shamelessness

Your lack of conscience

And your?flagrant steamroll

What part of no do you not understand?

Do you not understand?

What part of no do you not understand?

Do you not understand?



My sorrow is left off

My rages discounted



[BELLA]

My fears are founded

This dam is no more



[BELLA AND Chorus]

What part of no do you not understand?

Do you not understand?

What part of no do you not understand?

Do you not understand?

Don't touch me

My body is frozen

Thanks to you

And I've sat with these secrets

I'm no longer willing to

What part of no do you not understand?

Do you not understand?

What part of no do you not understand?

Do you not understand?



[BELLA AND NICK]

It's easy not to



[Chorus, (BELLA AND NICK)]

What goes around (so much easier not to)

To you...

Wake up



What part of no

Do you not understand
