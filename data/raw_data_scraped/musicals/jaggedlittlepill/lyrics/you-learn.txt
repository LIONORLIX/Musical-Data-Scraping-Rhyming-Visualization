You Learn


[MARY JANE]

I, recommend getting your heart trampled on to anyone, yeah

I, recommend walking around naked in?your?living room, yeah

Swallow?it down



[FRANKIE]

What a jagged little pill



[MARY JANE]

It?feels so good



[NICK]

Swimming in your stomach



[STEVE]

Wait until the dust settles



[MARY JANE, FRANKIE, NICK, STEVE]

You live you learn, you love you learn

You cry you learn, you lose you learn

You bleed you learn, you scream you learn



[JO]

I, recommend biting off more than you can chew to anyone



[FRANKIE]

I certainly do



[PHOENIX]

I, recommend sticking your foot in your mouth at any time



[JO]

Feel free



[BELLA]

Throw it down



[NICK]

The caution blocks you from the wind



[BELLA]

Hold it up



[NICK]

To the rays



[Chorus]

You wait and see when the smoke clears

You live you learn, you love you learn

You cry you learn, you lose you learn

You bleed you learn, you scream you learn



I, oh...



[STEVE AND MARY JANE]

Wear it out



[FRANKIE]

The way a three year old would do



[Chorus]

Melt it down



[MARY JANE]

You're gonna have to eventually, anyway



[Chorus]

The firetrucks are coming up around the bend



You live you learn, you love you learn

You cry you learn, you lose you learn

You bleed you learn, you scream you learn



(Thank you, India)



You grieve, you learn



(Thank you, providence)



You choke, you learn



(Thank you, disillusionment)



You love, you learn

You lose, you learn



(Thank you, clarity)

You pray, you learn



(Thank you, consequence)

You ask, you learn



(Thank you, thank you silence)



Ooh...
