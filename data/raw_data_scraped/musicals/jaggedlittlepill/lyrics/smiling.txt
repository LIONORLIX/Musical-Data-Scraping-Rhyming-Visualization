Smiling


[MARY JANE]

This is a life of extremes

Both sides are slippery and enticing

Here in my places off?the?rails



This loose recollection?of a fallen

Barely remember who I?felt

I was just trying to keep it together



This is the first wave of my white flag (Ah)

This is the sound of me hitting bottom (Ah)

This, my surrender, if that's what you call it

And the anatomy of my crash (Ah)



And I keep on smiling

Keep on moving

Can't stand still



Me, the ceilingless great achiever

Me the notorious perfect mother

Lord to ends of overwhelm



This is the first wave of my white flag (Ah)

This is the sound of me hitting bottom (Ah)

This, my surrender, if that's what you call it

And the anatomy of my crash (Ah)



And I keep on smiling

Keep on moving

Can't stand still



Such pretty forks in the road

On this continuum I've been bound to

Life flashing promise before my eyes



This is the first wave of my white flag (Ah)

This is the sound of me hitting bottom (Ah)

This, my surrender, if that's what you call it (Ah)

And the anatomy of my crash (Ah)



And I keep on smiling

Keep on moving

Can't stand still

Can't stand still
