Thinking Of Him / I Miss The Music (Reprise)


Aaron (spoken):

What was I thinking when I let you slip away? Oh yeah.

I was thinking of me.

(sung) Only of me

What was I thinking

Spending each moment of each waking day

Thinking of me

Shutting you out



Georgia:

Sometimes



Aaron:

Making you wait



Georgia:

Sometimes



Aaron:

To self-involved to say how I do need you

But why pretend

I missed the music

I missed my friend



Georgia:

I missed my friend



Aaron:

No need to wonder

What I would do



Both:

I choose the music

I make with you

I love the music

I make with you
