The Woman's Dead


Carmen (spoken):

Jessica Cranshaw will never be better than she was this evening.



Bobby:

But she was horrible.



Carmen:

I know. But she?ll never better. She?s dead.

That was the hospital on the phone. In terms of future performances,

Jessica Cranshaw now has a conflict.



Georgia:

Chris, do you want to say something to the company about Jessica?



Chris:

Shall we all observe a moment of silence ?

to match the audience?s response to Jessica?s first number?



Aaron:

Chris!



Chris:

Oh, all right. Jessica was part of our company and now we part company.

I?m sure we shall all remember her in our thoughts and in our resumes.

And now as thespians, I know you?d like to express your sorrow,

both as a tribute and as an acting exercise. Sasha?F Sharp minor.



All (sung):

Ooh, ooh, ooh



Carmen:

The woman?s dead

The woman?s dead



Aaron:

Go tell her fans to change their plans

The woman?s dead



Nikki:

Would someone care

To say a prayer?



Aaron:

Who might that be?



Chris:

Don?t look at me

Carmen, Aaron, and Chris:

The woman?s dead



All:

Ooh, ooh, ooh

The woman?s dead

She?s dead and gone



Bobby:

She?s flown the coop

And now our troupe is minus one



Nikki:

She sang each word

The angels heard

They closed her mouth and shipped her south



Bobby and Nikki:

The woman?s done



All:

Ooh, ooh, ooh

The woman?s dead

The woman?s dead



Bambi:

She was a bitch



Chris:

And under pitch



Bambi:

And now she?s dead



All:

Our star is dead



Aaron:

She had no voice



Oscar:

She had no wits



Carmen:

She had no brains

She just had tits

Aaron and Carmen:

And now she?s dead



All:

The woman?s dead

The woman?s dead



Johnny:

She?s taking ten

?Til God knows when

The woman?s dead



Men:

The skies are blue



Nikki:

Her lips are too



All:

Can?t blow her nose

Can?t shake her head

See for yourself

It?s like I said

The woman?s definitely

Positively ?



Cioffi (spoken):

Excuse me, I?m Lt. Frank Cioffi of the greater Boston Police.

I?m assigned to the homicide division and, oh, it?s an honor

to be standing on the same stage with each and every one of you!



All (sung):

Dead! Dead! Dead!
