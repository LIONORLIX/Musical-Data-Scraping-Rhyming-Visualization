Christopher

(spoken)

Wait a moment

You say that you are from homicide



Cioffi

(spoken)

Ah, well, yes

Based on preliminary autopsy it is clear that jessica cranshaw was murdered



Christopher

And what are they gonna do with her killer

I mean does he get some kind of trophy or pontiac convertible



Carmen

With georgia taking over the lead

We go ourselves a real shot

Man 1

You know if we leave now

We can make that last train back to new york

Stop!

It?s clear that everyone of you

Is in perfect physical condition

So the show must go on



Man 2

(spoken)

Carmen

(sung)

Because as old as time itself

There is a grand theatrical tradition

That the show must go on



Woman

(spoken)

Forget it!



Carmen

(sung)

You signed a contract

Go read your contract

And i will count to ten

Cioffi

(spoken)

I can?t believe i?m hearing this

I won?t believe it

Putting on a musical has gotta be the most fulfilling thing a person could ever hope to do

You people you?re all heroes to me



(sung)

You?re a special kind of people known as show people

You live in a world of your own

The audience paid plenty to sit there and clap

Hearing you sing, watching you tap



Did you know your dentist longs to be in show business

Your window washer wants to be a star

And though your analyst may

Never couch it that way



Carmen

(spoken)

Analyst, couch, ha ha.



Cioffi

(sung)

You don?t know how lucky you are

Some policemen and detectives dream of show business

They can?t arrested, but still

They sit around the station and fancy this life

They jeer sherlock holes

And cheer mack the knife



Carmen

Ask your cleaning lady, ?don?t you dream of show business

To vocalize or stretch beside a bar??



Cioffi

Her affirmative shrug

As she shampoos your rug



Cioffi & carmen

Let?s you know how lucky you are



There?s a special kind of aura

?Round a show person



Oscar

Just ask the next waiter you meet



Christopher

He walks in fifth position

His voice is just grand



Georgia

He gives you the check

Ya give him a hand



All

If the boys in valet parking turned to show business

They could scalp a higher ticket for your car



Oscar

And my tree surgeon now

Started taking a bow

(spoken)

A bough, get it? B-o-u-g



Everyone else

You don?t know how lucky you are



Company

We?re a special kind of people known as show people

We live in a world of our own

Our days are tied to curtains

They rise and they fall

We?re born every night

At half-hour call



Johnny

(spoken)

Half hour!



Company

We can?t picture being anything but show people

Civilians find the whole thing quite bizarre

But that hop in our hearts

When the overture starts

Helps us know how lucky we are



Carmen

(spoken)

Show people



Carmen

(spoken)

Show people



Carmen

(spoken)

Come on!

Everybody



Company

It?s an honor and a joy to be in show business

I feel that spotlight hit me and i?m gone

At the last curtain call

I?m the envy of all

So i know the show must



Carmen

(sung)

Go on!



Company

So thrilling! We?re show people!



Carmen

And on!



Company

So willing! We?re show people!
