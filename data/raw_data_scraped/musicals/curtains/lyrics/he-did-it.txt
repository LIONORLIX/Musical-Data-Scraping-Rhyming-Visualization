He Did it


(snoring)



GEORGIA

(spoken)

You can?t sleep either



BOBBY

(spoken)

Knowing that somebody in this company is a killer

I thought I saw our Director sneakin? around



GEORGIA

Murder is a very British thing, isn?t it.

I mean, it?s almost like a hobby over there



BOBBY

Yeah, you know if I had to bet

I?d say he did it



ENSEMBLE

Ahhhhhh

He did it He did it He did it He did it He did it He did it

I?m sure

Although he appears with his posture and pious

His principles hardly are pure



It isn?t a stretch to believe it

That murderous motive was his

He did it He did it

He did it then hid it

And now he is off to a pris-on



NIKI

You can?t sleep either



AARON

Know that somebody in this company is a killer

I thought I saw Bambi sneaking around

Maybe she killed Jessica so that you could take over the lead

And Bambi could have your part



NIKI

Oh, that?s silly.

She should have just killed me

I never said that



AARON

If you ask me

She did it



ENSEMBLE

Ahhhhhh

She did it She did it She did it She did it She did it She did it

I know

With laughter she hung him

And after she strung him

He swung like a yo-yo High Low



The facts are not really surprising

Our morals are probably loose

She did it She did it

She did it then hid it

And now she is off to the hoose-gow



OSCAR/CHRISTOPHER

Ahhhh



OSCAR

You can?t sleep either



CHRISTOPHER

Knowing that somebody in this company is gonna change my blocking



OSCAR

I think I saw Aaron and Georgia sneakin? around



CHRISTOPHER

Yeah, some writing teams are always plottin? on how to do in the director

And they?re all quite, quite mad

I could easily believe that they did it



ENSEMBLE

Ahhhhhh

They did it They did it They did it They did it

I?ve worked with those losers before

They went right ahead

And they slaughtered two people

The same way they slaughtered the score



Well, this is the end of their output

Their future is not worth a thing

They did it They did it

They did it then hid

And soon they?ll be going to sing-sing



ENSEMBLE
