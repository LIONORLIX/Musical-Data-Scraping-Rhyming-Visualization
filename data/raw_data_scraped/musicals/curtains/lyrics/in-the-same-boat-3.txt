In The Same Boat 3


The sea's unusually rough

The going's terribly tough

As if that wasn't enough

They've lost an oar



They find it all they can do

To calm the craft

Furthermore little chum

They're so dumb

That they don't

Know their fore

From their aft



The waves are lappin' a lot

The sharks are snappin' a lot

The thunder's clapping' a lot

Just hear it roar

(Just hear it roar)



But there's no doubt in the world

They'll stay afloat

'cause it's easy to win

Take it all on the chin

When you're in the same boat
