Wide Open Spaces Finale


CIOFFI

Of course the show will go on! The sound of the orchestra playing the overture will be pure adrenaline. His spirits will be lifted by the hands of an adoring throng, whose applause will sustain him through the very last scene of Robbin Hood!

ALL

I'll see those wide open spaces

And know that Kansas is home



K-A-N-S-A-S U-S-A!
