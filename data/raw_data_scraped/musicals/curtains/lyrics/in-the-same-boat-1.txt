In the Same Boat 1


Georgia, Nikki, and Bambi:

In the same boat

On the same sea

Shaking inside as the tide keeps risin'

Nary a ship

Nary a sail

Nary a soul on the whole horizon

Oh how we long to stand still

Stomachs are in distress

We need a helping hand, still

No one is near

Who can hear

When we S.O.S.

Tattered and torn

Weary and worn

Feeling forlorn that we look untidy

Chewing our nails

Praying that whales

Aren't allowed to eat meat on Fridays

Still we are not discouraged

Due to the ancient quote

That you're likely to win

Take it all on the chin

When you're in the same boat
