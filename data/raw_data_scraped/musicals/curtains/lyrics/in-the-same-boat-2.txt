In the Same Boat 2


Here we are

My shipmates and me

Lost on a windy sea

All the planks are springin' a leak

We'd like to bail

But we forgot the pail

And we regret to say

Our compass is gone

But somehow we still sail on

Because two heads

(Three heads!)

Are best, as some fellow wrote

And what the heck, we're in the same boat!
