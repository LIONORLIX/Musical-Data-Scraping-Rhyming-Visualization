A Tough Act to Follow


Cioffi (spoken): May I be bold?

I never believed in that whole ?some enchanted evening? thing, until now.

The first time I saw you, there was a blue wash on the stage

and they hit ya with a pink special. It was?



Niki (spoken): It was just like a musical, huh Frank?



Cioffi (spoken): I thought, Niki, I thought to myself

(singing)

You and I,

We could be

A tough act to follow

Can't ya see?

Special people doing special things

Running rings around any pair

Anywhere

You and I,

We could stay

A tough act to follow

In every way

If you hold my hand

And let the music start

Let the curtains part

Let the spot light glow?



Cioffi (spoken): Gosh, I wish I could do that.



Niki (spoken): Well, you can Frank. It?s simple really. Just follow me.

Stomp. Hop. Slap. Step. Slap. Step. Stamp. Stamp.



Cioffi and Niki (spoken): Stomp. Hop. Slap. Step. Slap. Step. Stamp. Stamp.



Cioffi (spoken): Stomp. Hop. Slap. Step. Slap. Step. Stamp. Stamp.



Niki(spoken): Hey, you?ve done this before.

How about a spotlight of your own?

Hey, Harry, put him in pink! Oh, looking

good, Frank. Lookin? real good!

(singing)

We?d be a tough act to follow

A tough act to follow

I know



Cioffi (spoken): Are you thinkin? what I?m thinkin??



Niki (spoken): I sure think I am.



Cioffi and Niki (spoken): Come on, gang.

Special people doing special things

Running rings around any pair

Anywhere

You and I,

We could stay

A tough act to follow

In every way

Ahhhhhhh

Let the curtains part

Let the spot light glow?
