Carmen:

I've never been known as one of those stupid clucks [pause] Elaine.



Bambi:

Carmen:

Who pisses away a lot of her hard earned bucks [pause] Elaine



Bambi:

Carmen:

But let's face it your coloratura sucks bambi,

Though it breaks your mother's heart,

Forget about the part,

It's time for you to know

Why I really backed this show.



You ask me for my motives

Well, you needn't be so smart,

It's a business.

It isn't making history,

It isn't making art,

It's a business.



Shaw and Ibsen take 'em away,

And don't bother me with Molière,

Those Russians never pay.



So go on criticise me,

Please, proceed with your attack,

It's a business



I put one million in

And I expect two million back,

It's a business



So, what crime have i committed

If I'm putting up a fight?

It's a business



And I want those paying suckers

Out there giving me the business

Every night



Carmen:

Am I getting through to you, Elaine?



Bambi:

I'm sorry mother, but to me the theatre is a temple.



Carmen:

What so it should only be filled on shabbat? Give me a hand fellas. [they clap] Very funny. You know what I mean. Back me up.



Carmen:

The not for profit theatres

Don't need to turn a buck

That's not business



Guys:

That's not business



Carmen:

So give them Lysistrata

And I wish them lots of luck

I do business



Guys:

She does business



Carmen:

Dorky schmorky

Money misspent

You won't survive Yom Kippur

You'll never get through Lent



I once knew a producer

Whose pretension knew no bounds

In the business



Guys:

In the business



Carmen:

He mounted Samuel Beckett

I don't mean it like it sounds

It was business



Guys:

It was business



Carmen:

So now he's down the crapper

While I'm working in my prime

It's a business



Guys:

It's a business



Carmen:

And the shows I do do business

'Cause I really know my business

And I'm giving them the business, honey

All the time



Bambi:

But what about the great poets of the stage?



Carmen:

Honey i put on the ice man cometh and nobody cameth



Carmen:

To stage hands

To the dressers

To musicians in the pit

It's a business



Guys:

It's a business



Carmen:

The owner of this premesis cleans up if we're a hit

He's in business



Guys:

He's in business



Carmen:

Union workers don't work for free

Hey Harry on the spotlight

Blink twice if you agree



See!



I'm not devoid of culture

But my feet are on the floor

It's a business



Guys:

It's a business



Carmen:

I do the Kama Sutra

With a Richard Rogers score

That's good business



Guys:

That's good business



Carmen:

Yes, green's my favorite color,

And I don't mean on the grass

It's a business



Guys:

It's a business



Carmen:

And the shows I do do business,

Yes I'm good at doin' business,

And if you don't like my business sweetie,



Blow it out your—



Guys:

Carmen:

All:

It's a business
