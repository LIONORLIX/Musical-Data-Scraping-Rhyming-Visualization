What Kind of Man?


Georgia:

Oh my God!



Aaron:

Holy mother in heaven!



Carmen:

Holy shit!



Oscar:

What? The reviews aren?t good? What don?t they like?



Georgia:

That we put on a show!



Aaron:

The Boston Globe says,

?If you loved Oklahoma,

stay there as long as ?Robbin? Hood? is running in Boston!?



Carmen:

Critics! Who?d make a living out of killing other people?s dreams? I mean

(sung)

What kind of man would take a job like that



Oscar:

What kind of slob would take a job like that



Carmen and Oscar:

Who could be mean enough

Base and obscene enough

To take a job like that



Georgia (spoken):

Wait a minute! Here?s something in the Herald that might be good!

?Formerly married composer and lyricist Aaron Fox and

Georgia Hendricks have provided film star Jessica Cranshaw with a star vehicle ..

that ought to be driven off a cliff.?



Aaron (sung):

What kind of mom would raise her boy like that



Georgia:

Who?d want her baby to destroy like that



All:

Who could be jerk enough

Hard up for work enough

To want a job like that



Ohhhhhhhhhh what kind of low down dirty bum

Ohhhhhhhhhh what kind of swine-ish scurvy scum

Loathsome as they come, I wonder



Oscar:

What kind of man would want a job like that



Carmen:

What kind of putz would squeeze your nuts like that

Who could be prick enough



All:

Mentally sick enough

Who?d want to grow to be

Everyone?s enemy

Critics are hated and

So excoriated tell me

What kind of man

Would want a job like ?



Oscar (spoken):

Hey, hey, hey, get a load of this?the Cambridge Patriot says,

?Considering the talent and experience of the veterans

involved, ?Robbin? Hood? is sure to be a huge Broadway ? smash.?



All:

What kind of genius has a mind like that

So perspicacious, wise and kind like that

Far from his mother?s knee

She must be thrilled to see

How he grew up to be

Such brilliant company

Refined and reflective

We?re completely objective

But it mists up your heart

To meet a man like that!
