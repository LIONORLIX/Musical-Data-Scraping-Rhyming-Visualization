Frogs! Frogs! Frogs! Frogs!

Be-de-de-beep, be-de-de-beep,

Leave it alone and get some sleep.

Leave it alone, you're in too deep.

You gotta look before you leap.



And nothing and nobody knows how to leap

More

Than the frogs!

Not for fancy pants humanitarians,

Not for chatty platitudinarians,

But for easy-going, simple, jocular,

Ocular

Frogs,

Who can thrive

Just by staying friendly and alive.

When there's any trouble, we survive,

We just dive

And go

Blep blep blep blep!

Blep blep blep blep!



DIONYSOS:

How dare you! You twisted amphibious monsters!



MEN:

Whaddya get, stirring the pot?

Wouldn't you rather sit and squat?

Everything's gonna stay afloat,

As long as you don't rock the boat.



WOMEN and TENORS:

Dive deep! Splash around!

Whaddya want with solid ground?

Whaddya wanna get apoplexy?



MEN:

You could be a very sexy

Frog!

C'mon, abandon ship

And skip the trip,

And take a dip.



ALL FROGS:

Just pull up a pad

And simply flop,

It's time to stop.

To frolic and plop

And learn how to hop --



It's hip to hop.

Hip hop! Hip hop!



DIONYSOS:

[screaming as he falls]

Aaaahhhhhhhhh! This is terrible!! This is... this is... wonderful!!!

No, no, stop, please!

Ohhhhhhh.... can't we all just get along?!



FROGS:

Brek-kek-kek-kek kek-kek kek-kek...

Rib-et rib-et!



Stay with the frogs,

With the frogs, Kek-kek

With the wits of the bogs! Brek-kek-kek-kek! Brek-kek-kek-kek!

Not your hippy dippy insurrectionists, Whaddya care the world's a wreck?

Not your hasty pasty-faced perfectionists, Everyone knows the world's a wreck.

Stay with the easy-going, simple, rollicking, Leave 'em alone, send 'em a check,

Frolicking Why do you want to break your neck?

Frogs

In the reeds

Leave the world alone and count the weeds.

While the world may not know what it needs,



DIONYSOS:

Help!



FROGS:

It proceeds

And in time

Will be



DIONYSOS:

Xanthias!



FROGS:

Sublime



XANTHIAS:

Master!



FROGS:

All bogs

And weeds

And frogs



DIONYSOS:

I was almost turned into one of the frogs!



FROGS:

Frogs



XANTHIAS:

I thought he said there were no frogs.



DIONYSOS:

Obviously we were incredibly misinformed.



XANTHIAS:

They look pretty big to be frogs.



DIONYSOS:

Indeed.



XANTHIAS:

With a surprisingly innate sense of rhythm.



DIONYSOS:

Yes. Do you think we could postpone this discussion until after my rescue?



XANTHIAS:

Sure thing!



DIONYSOS:

Thank you, Xanthias -- for a minute there I was really worried.



[A giant frog appears behind them]



XANTHIAS:

Now no need to worry, master, not while I'm around. I've got the reflexes of a panther.

Well maybe not a panther, more like a highly-strung farm animal, but I'm pretty limber.

These frogs, they don't scare me.

By the time I'm through with them,

there'll be nothing left but their little frog legs --

which I hear can make for some pretty good eating.

I wonder how they came up with that recipe?

"Uh-oh, Marcel. We're out of snails -- quick grab that frog."

Ha-ha -- it's pretty funny, huh? But seriously, master... master?



[He turns around, sees the giant frog disappear with DIONYSOS in its mouth]



Master!!!



FROGS:

Frogs frogs frogs frogs

Brek-kek-kek-kek-kek-kek-

Kek-kek-kek-kek-kek-kek-kek



[All the FROGS exit]



XANTHIAS:

I think we're gonna need a bigger boat.
