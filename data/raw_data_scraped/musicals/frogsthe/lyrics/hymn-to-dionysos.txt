Hymn to Dionysos


THE DIONYSIANS:

Dionysos,

We are come to praise you

For the wondrous blessing, the taste of wine.



Evoe!

Alalai! Alalai!

Evoe!

Alalalalalalai!



Dionysos,

We are come to thank you

For the gentle tendrils that intertwine

To produce the grapes that produce the wine.



Evoe!

Alalai! Alalai!

Evoe!

Alalalalalalai!



Out of wine comes truth,

Out of truth the vision clears,

And with vision soon appears

A grand design.

From the grand design

You can understand the world.

And when you understand the world,

You need a lot more wine.



Dionysos,

We are come to join you

In a shout of joy at the only shrine

Where you come benighted and leave benign.

For that endless blessing, the taste of wine,



Evoe!

Alalai! Alalai!

Evoe!

Alalalalalalai!

Evoe!



Wine makes the passions sing,

Wine leads the feet to dance,

Wine answers every question.

Pour the wine!

Wine takes away the sting,

Wine gives the heart its chance,

Wine aids the indigestion.

Pour the wine!



See the curmudgeon smile,

Hear the insomniac snore,

Look at the coward roar,

All from the vine.

Pour the wine!

Wine lends a sense of style,

Wine gets the spirit to soar,

Wine makes you thirsty -- pour more wine!

More

Wine!



Wine helps the edges blur,

Wine lets the mind escape,

Wine settles all dissension.

Pour the wine!

Wine makes the blood to stir,

Wine leads to friendly rape,

Wine eases tension --

What an invention

Is wine!

Pour the wine!

Glory be to wine!



DIONYSOS:

Dionysos,

They are come to praise me

For the great discovery of them all.



THE DIONYSIANS:

Evoe!



DIONYSOS:

Alalai! Alalai!



THE DIONYSIANS:

DIONYSOS:

THE DIONYSIANS:

Dionysos...



DIONYSOS:

Red or white or pink

It's the thing to drink --



THE DIONYSIANS:

We are come to thank you...

We are come to praise...



DIONYSOS:

Evoe!



THE DIONYSIANS:

Evoe!

Alalalalalalai!



DIONYSOS:

Woo-hoo -- it's getting a little hot.



XANTHIAS:

Well, this is Hades.



DIONYSOS:

I'm sorry, have we met?



XANTHIAS:

I'm Xanthias!



DIONYSOS:

Oh right. Want some wine?



Alalalalalalalalalalalalalalai!



WOMEN:

Dionysos!

We are come to praise you

For the mind's escape

For the friendly rape

We are come to praise



We are come to praise by the fading light,

To exalt your name in the sacred rite.



DIONYSOS:

Which begins at five

And goes on all night!

Evoe!



THE DIONYSIANS:

Evoe!



DIONYSOS:

Evoe!



THE DIONYSIANS:

Evoe!



ALL:

Evoe!

Alalai!
