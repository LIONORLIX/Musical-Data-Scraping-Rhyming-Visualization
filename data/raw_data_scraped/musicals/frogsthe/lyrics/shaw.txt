Shaw


DIONYSOS:

I knew that I could do it

I knew it, I knew it.

I knew they'd all pooh-pooh it,

And indeed they did.



I knew if I stuck to it,

I'd somehow get through it.

At times I thought, "Oh, screw it!"

But proceed I did,

And oh, you kid -- !



I just met Shaw!

I got to meet Shaw!

There isn't any doubt

The man's without

A single flaw!



I talked to Shaw,

I said to him, "Shaw,

The world is in a crisis."

He said, "Listen, Dionysos,

What you need is Shaw.

I'll go with you," says Shaw.

"I happen to be free,

And who could be

A bigger draw?"



That instant generosity,

That's Shaw!

The verbal virtuosity,

That's Shaw!

The fearless animosity,

That mind with such velocity --

All right, there's the pomposity,

But that's just Shaw.

[Reluctantly]

And maybe some verbosity,

But still you'll be

In awe.



[Commotion inside PLUTO's palace, growing louder]



DIONYSOS:

And here comes Shaw!



[Music continues under as the palace doors open and the Great Man enters.

He holds up his hand. Music stops]



SHAW:

Dionysos, your arrival is most fortuitous.

My fellow playwrights I fear have lost the art of conversation,

but not, unfortunately, the power of speech.



[The SHAVIANS enter laughing; music resumes]



DIONYSOS:

He has no use for piety

Or notions of propriety.

He'll show us our society

In ways we never saw.



[Music stops again]



SHAW:

I'm sick to death of the Underworld. It is like sitting for

all eternity at the first act of a fashionable play before the complications begin.



[The SHAVIANS murmur admiringly; music resumes]



DIONYSOS:

The world will soon be dancing "The Shaw."



DIONYSIAN:

How do you dance the Shaw?



DIONYSOS:

[To the SHAVIANS]

Tell him.



SHAVIANS:

First you think.

Then you comment.



[Music stops momentarily as they all murmur something brief

and judicious to each other; then it resumes]



SHAVIANS:

Then you think.

Then you discuss.



[Music stops again as they babble to each other more animatedly;

two loud chords halt the discussion and music continues]



SHAVIANS:

Then you read,

Then you make a quip.



[Music stops]



SHAW:

All great truths begin as blasphemies.



[Music resumes]



SHAVIANS:

That's how you dance "The Shaw."



DIONYSOS:

[Front, spoken in rhythm, as music continues]

Isn't he amazing?

Isn't he adorable?

[to the SHAVIANS]

Couldn't you die?

Well, you already have.

Still --



SHAVIANS:

Words can dance,

Thoughts can dance,

Syllables can samba.

Sentences can waltz around in your mind.

Epigrams can leap and bound,

Simply from the way they sound --



[Music stops]



SHAW:

Patriotism is the conviction that this country is superior to all other countries

because you were born in it.



[Music resumes]



DIONYSOS:

Even when he's not profound,

He's so refined!



[Music stops]



SHAW:

Democracy substitutes election by the incompetent many for appointment by the corrupt few.



[Music resumes]



SHAVIANS:

Shaw will show the way,

Shaw is for today.

Take him off the shelf.



DIONYSOS:

Everything he writes

Dazzles and delights --

He told me so himself.



[Music stops]



SHAW:

When a man knows nothing and thinks he knows everything,

that points clearly to a political career.



[Music resumes]



DIONYSOS:

[Spoken in rhythm]

Couldn't you just put him on

Toast points and eat him for lunch?

[Singing]

I'll show them Shaw!



SHAVIANS:

First you think...



DIONYSOS:

I want to share Shaw!



SHAVIANS:

Then you reason...



DIONYSOS:

I'm sure of Shaw!



SHAVIANS:

Then you think.

Then you digress...



SHAW:

The worst sin toward our fellow creatures

is not to hate them but to be indifferent to them;

that is the essence of inhumanity. Next!



SHAVIANS:

Such sanity, humanity,

Who cares about the vanity?

His work is just so literate,

It leaves you all atwitter, it's

Got gravity and levity,

That's why it's got longevity.



DIONYSOS:

A little short on brevity --

Is that against the law?



DIONYSOS, SHAVIANS:

We still need Shaw!

I'm [He's] bringing back Shaw!

The world will have an orgy

Of Georgie

Shaw!
