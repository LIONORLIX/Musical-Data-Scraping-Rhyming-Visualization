Fear No More


SHAKESPEARE:

Cowards die many times before their deaths;

The valiant never taste of death but once.

Of all the wonders that I yet have heard

It seems to me most strange that men should fear;

Seeing that death, a necessary end,

Will come when it will come.



[singing]

Fear no more the heat o' th' sun,

Nor the furious winter's rages,

Thou thy worldly task hast done,

Home art gone, and ta'en thy wages.

Golden lads and girls all must,

As chimney-sweepers, come to dust.



Fear no more the lightning-flash

Nor th' all dreaded thunder-stone.

Fear not slander, censure rash,

Thou hast finish'd joy and moan.

All lovers young, all lovers must

Consign to this and come to dust.
