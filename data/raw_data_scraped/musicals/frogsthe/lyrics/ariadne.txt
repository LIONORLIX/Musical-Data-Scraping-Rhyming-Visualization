Ariadne


XANTHIAS:

What was she like? Your wife?



DIONYSOS:

Ah...

She was young, she was wild,

Ariadne...

She was shy, like a child,

Had this funny dimple when she smiled,

Lips as soft as petals,

Hair the color of the sun,

Breasts --



XANTHIAS:

I get it.



DIONYSOS:

And eyes that looked at me as if I were a god.

Which I am.



XANTHIAS:

Half.



DIONYSOS:

[Pointing at the tiller]

You steer.



XANTHIAS:

Tell me more.



DIONYSOS:

Being young, feeling odd,

I mean, when you're married to a god,

Mingling with the likes of

Zeus and Hera, Aphrodite and Apollo...



XANTHIAS:

Namedropper.



DIONYSOS:

So I gave her a crown

On the day we were wed.

"If you look like a goddess,

You'll feel like a goddess,"

I said.

Ariadne...



[XANTHIAS, touched, stops steering]



And the years filled with joy

And my heart filled with pride,

Just to know Ariadne was there at my side.

Then she died.

Being mortal, she died...



She was young, she was shy,

Ariadne...

She was young, as was I,

Surely, she was much too young to die.

So I flung her crown high into the sky,

In a rage,

With a cry:

"Ariadne!... Ariadne!..."



And its jewels broke free

And they never came down,

But they stayed there as stars

In the shape of a crown.

And they're there every night

As a sign of our love,

And it fills me with joy

And it fills me with pain.



It reminds me of how much

I miss her and want her

And wish every day she were here.



There are no stars in hell.

Just as well...



Ariadne... Ariadne... Ariadne...
