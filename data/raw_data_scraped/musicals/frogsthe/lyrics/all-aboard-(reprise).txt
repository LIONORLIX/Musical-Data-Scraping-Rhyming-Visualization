All Aboard (reprise)


CHARON:

[As his boat enters from the sky, stopping midway]

All aboard!

All aboard!

[Rings the bell]

Hades Express!

[Rings the bell]

Last bell

For the other hell,

Good old Earth.

[Rings the bell]

Where you're cursed at birth --

[Rings the bell]

Where hearts are heavy and heads are bowed

And each silver lining conceals a cloud.

Where men are men and sheep are nervous --

[Rings the bell]

At your service.

All aboard!
