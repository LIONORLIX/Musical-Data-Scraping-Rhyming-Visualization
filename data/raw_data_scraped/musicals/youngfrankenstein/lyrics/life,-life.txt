Life, Life


FREDERICK FRANKENSTEIN

(Spoken)

So, now we hurl the gauntlet of science into the frightful face of death its self



(Sung)

Ever since the beginning of time

When life arose from prime evil slime

Death has ruled without question

Death has Ruled supreme

Without the least suggestion

That man could foil it's scheme

But now we call on science

To end deaths evil reign

We shout in brave defiance

This soul shall live again



Life, life, let my creature live

Life, life, it's life that you must give

Fate, fate, through this storm and strife

Fate, fate, give my creature life

Tear the night asunder

Cast your light upon the dark

The lightning bolts and thunder will ignite a mortal spark



Life, life, ere the break of dawn

Life, life, let my dream be born

Fate, fate, through this storm and strife

Fate, fate, give my creature life

Give my creature life



(spoken)

This is it! Igor, throw the first switch



IGOR

Yes Master



FREDERICK FRANKENSTEIN

(sung)

Life, life, give my creature life

Give my creature life



(spoken)

Now, throw the second switch



IGOR

Yes Master



COMPANY

Give the creature life



FREDERICK FRANKENSTEIN

(sung)

Tear the night asunder

Cast your light upon the dark

The lightning bolts and thunder will ignite a mortal spark



(spoken)

Now, Igor, throw the third switch



IGOR

Not the third switch



FREDERICK FRANKENSTEIN

Yes the third switch, throw it damn you throw it



IGOR

Yes master



FREDERICK FRANKENSTEIN

Inga, now!



FREDERICK

Give me life!

Ere the break of dawn

Let my dream be born, be born!

Through this storm and strife

Through the wind swept air

Listen to my prayer

Stir his brain

Let breathing start

Let me hear his beating heart

give my creature life!!



FRAU BLUCHER, INGA, IGOR

(echoing, overlapping)

Life, life 'ere the break of dawn

Life, life let this dream be born!

Fate, fate,

Through this storm and strife

Fate, fate,

Through the wind swept air,

Listen to his prayer

Stir it's brain, let breathing start

Let him hear his beating heart.

Give the creature life!
