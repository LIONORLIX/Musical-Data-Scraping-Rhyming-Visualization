Roll In The Hay


Frederick:(Spoken)How are we getting to the castle?



Inga:(Speaks in German)



Frederick:(Spoken)What's that?



Inga:(Spoken)A hay ride!



Inga:Roll, roll, roll in ze hay

Roll, roll your troubles away

When life is awful

Just jump on a straw full

And roll, roll in ze hay



Roll, roll, roll in ze hay

Roll, roll, do it all day

When spirits are saggin'

Just jump in a wagon

And roll, roll in ze hay



Inga:(Spoken)I'm very high spirited doctor. I hope you won't hold it against me.



Frederick:(Spoken)Oh. I'll try not to.



Inga:Hitch those horses up for a gay ride

We'll have lot's of fun

Nothings better than a hay ride

Underneath the sun

Roll, roll, roll in ze hay

Sometimes love finds a way

You might steal a kiss

From an unwitting miss

Whose not to resistant to play

So let's roll, roll, roll, roll in ze hay



Inga:(Spoken)So, have you thought of any ways you could use me?
