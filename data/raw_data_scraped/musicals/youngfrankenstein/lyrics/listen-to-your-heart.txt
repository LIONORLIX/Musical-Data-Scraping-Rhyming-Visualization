Listen to Your Heart


[Inga]

Let's forget about thinking.

Thinking's never smart.

Flush your brain right down the drain

And listen to your heart!



Let's be a couple of dumbbells,

Dumb right from the start.

Lose your mind, 'cause love it blind,

And listen to your heart!



Lets be stupid together

Not a thought in our head

Bird brains of a feather

Who fly right into bed



Lets be totally foolsih

Two nitwits never apart

You'll find such bliss in, the kissin' you're missin',

So listen, listen to your heart!



As ev'rybody knows,

If it's sex they're thinking of,

Intellectuals are ineffectuals

When it comes to making love.



Nietzsche always said he wouldn't,

Schopenhauer thought he shouldn't,

And as for immanuel kant,

Ev'ry girl in town knew that kant,

Couldn't.



Listen to your heart!



Listen to your heart!

Let's be blithering idiots,

Singing love's sweet song.

We'll blither ev'ry morning,

And blither all night long!



Let's find things undiscovered,

Don't resist cupid's dart,

You'll find such joy,

Just being a boy,

So listen, listen to your heart!
