Man About Town


[Frederick]

Now you're a creature,

A primitive soul,

You don't know your left from your right,

You're lost in the dark,

You need a spark,

To lead you into the light



I'll be that guide,

I'll be by your side,

I'll put you out of the mire,

You'll be the greatest creation of man

Since the invention of fire!



You will walk

You will talk

Ev'rybody witll gawk

At the man about town!



From the start

You'll be smart

You'll break

Every heart

You're the man

About town



And i know

When you open that door,

You'll be cheered, never feared evermore!



Raise yor eyes to the skies,

There's no holding you down

You won't be a flash in the pan

You're the man...

The man about town!



Though you feel like a beast in a cage,

Stick with me,

And you'll be

On the stage!



Throw your hat in the ring,

They might make you a king,

And you'll trade that hat for a crown,

You're the man,

You're the man about town!
