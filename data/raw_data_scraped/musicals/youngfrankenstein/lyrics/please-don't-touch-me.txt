Please Don't Touch Me


[Elizabeth]

Dream all you want my darling

Of every lustful situation

Those naughty thoughts

Are fine with me

As long as they

Stay locked away

In your imagination



You can hug me til I scream

If it's only in a dream

But please don't touch me

You can feel me til I squeal

Just as long as it's not real

But please don't touch me



You can stick me

You can lick me

You can pinch me til I'm blue

You can bite me

And delight me til I'm blind

You can savage me

And ravage me

I care not what you do

If the lovely filthy things you do

Are only in your mind



You can spank me til I'm red

If it's only in your head

But please don't touch me

You can have me don't you see

If it's just a fantasy

But please don't touch me



[spoken]

Oh Freddie, darling, I know that you're a virgin.



[Frederick Frankenstein]

Yes, for me, science has always come first.



[Elizabeth]

And as every guy in New York knows - I come first too.



After our wedding

You'll be oh so glad we waited

Until then

Take cold showers when you're overstimulated



Anticipation is sublime

And although you might think I'm

A tease

Please don't touch me



[Female pedestrian]

Oh everybody look!  How unique.  They're not touching.



[Male pedestrian]

It must be "Please Don't Touch Me,"

the new dance craze that's sweeping catholic girl schools all over the midwest.



[Female pedestrian]

Oh what fun!  Let's try it.



[Chorus]

Please don't

Please don't

Please don't touch me



[Elizabeth]

Do not hug us

Do not drug us

Do not slug us til we cry

Do not throb us

Do not rob us of our wits



[Male chorus]

We won't poke you

We won't stroke you

Til we're just about to die



[Elizabeth]

But even in your wildest dreams

Don't dare to touch our tits

Don't dare to touch our tits



[Female chorus]

Don't dare to touch our tits

Don't touch our tits

Don't touch our tits

Don't touch our



[Elizabeth]

Tits, tits, tits, tits

Tits, tits, tits, tits

Tits!

Our tits!



When we're absolutely wed

You can do it til we're dead



[Frederick Frankenstein]

Elizabeth!



[Chorus]

Til then please, please, please

We're down on our knees



[Elizabeth]

Please keep your hands off these



[Chorus & Elizabeth]

Please don't touch me



[Chorus]

We won't touch you



[Elizabeth]

Please don't touch me



[Chorus]

We won't touch you



[Chorus & Elizabeth]

She's so touchy



[Elizabeth]

OH!
