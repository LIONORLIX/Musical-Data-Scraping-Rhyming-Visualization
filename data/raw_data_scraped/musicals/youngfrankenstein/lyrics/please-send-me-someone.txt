Please Send Me Someone


[Hermit]

(spoken)

Oh, Lord, please take pity!

I'm blind and oh so lonely!



(sung)

Someone,

Send me someone

I need someone

Who will care



Someone,

Send me someone

A friend to end despair



Someone to comfort my soul,

Someone to make my life whole,

Can you hear me?



Someone,

I'm praying for someone,

I'm saying there's someone

Out there for me!



Each night I'm yearning,

Tossing and turning,

Dreaming my dream comes true!



Someone,

Please send me someone,

I'm so blue.



(spoken)

Oh, lordy. Look down on your poor blind hermit.

It's been so long since I felt the touch of someone's hand,

so long since I heard the sound of someone's voice.

Each night, all I hear is the wind in the trees, and if I'm lucky, an or maybe...a cricket.

Oh, Lord, let's face it, we're talkin' LONELY here.



(sung)

Can you hear me?

Someone,

I'm praying for someone,

I'm saying there's someone

Out there for me.



Each night I'm yearning,

Tossing and turning,

Dreaming my dream comes true!



Someone,

Please send me someone,

Dear God, send someone

Thank you!
