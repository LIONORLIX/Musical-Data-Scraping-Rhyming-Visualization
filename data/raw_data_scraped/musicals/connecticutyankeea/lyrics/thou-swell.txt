Thou Swell


He:



Babe, we are well met,

As in a spell met,

I lift my helmet,

Sandy; You're just dandy.

For just this here lad.

You're such a fistfull.

My eyes are mistful,

Are you too wistful to care,

Do say you care to say;

"Come near lad."

You are so graceful,

have you wings?

You have a face full of nice things;

You have no speaking voice, dear,

With ev'ry word it sings.

She:



Thy words are queer, Sir,

Unto mine ear, Sir,

Yet thou'rt a dear, Sir, to me;

Thou could'st woo me;

Now could'st though try, knight.

I'd murmur "Swell", too,

And like it well too;

More thou wilt tell to Sandy.

Thou art dandy;

Now art though my knight.

Thine arms are martial;

Thou hast grace;

My cheek is partial to they face;

And if they lips grow weary,

Mine are resting place.

Refrain:



Thou swell! Thou witty!

Thou sweet! Thou grand!

Wouldst kiss me pretty?

Wouldst hold my hand?

Both thine eyes are cute too;

What they do to me.

Hear me holler I choose a Sweet lollapaloosa in thee.

I'd feel so rich in a hut for two;

Two rooms and a kitchen I'm sure would do;

Give me just a plot of,

Not a lot of land,

And Thou swell! Thou Witty! Thou Grand!
