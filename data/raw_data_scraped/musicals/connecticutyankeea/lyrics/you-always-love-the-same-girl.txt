You Always Love The Same Girl


ARTHUR:

'Tis a jolly song in truth.





MARTIN:

I learned it in my youth

In quite another mundus

From this genus Vagabundus.





ARTHUR:

Mean-est thou hoboes?





MARTIN:

Let's rest our boboes.

I've walked so long I'm really out of breath.





ARTHUR:

Thy galloping jeep did leap itself to death.

'Twas thy fault we hit the willow tree

Thine eyes were never on the wheel.



MARTIN:

There was something on my brain

When the jeep jumped off the lane.



ARTHUR:

'Tis the maid, and I know how thou dost feel.



VERSE



MARTIN:

I loved another girl once,

In another world, in another land.

I love another girl now ,

In this other world, in this other land.

I don't think I'm a man to blame.



ARTHUR:

Not if the girls were much the same.



MARTIN:

Not much the same-but just the same.

Explicitly-

Implicitly-

Illicitly the same.



REFRAIN



You always see the same girl

In every girl you love,

Though one is dark, the other fair.

It's not the eyes-it's not the hair.

There's something very similar there

In every girl you love.



ARTHUR:

The moment that you meet her

You know you've met before.

If you love more than one or two

She's still the same. What can you do?

More power to you,

For you are not untrue.



BOTH:

You always love the same sweet girl

Or you would not be you.
