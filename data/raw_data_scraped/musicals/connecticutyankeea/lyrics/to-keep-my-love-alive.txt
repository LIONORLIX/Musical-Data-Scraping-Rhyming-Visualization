To Keep My Love Alive


I've been married and married,

and often I've sighed,

I'm never a brides-maid,

I'm always the bride,

I never divorced them,

I hadn't the heart,

Yet, remember those sweet words,

"Till death do us part."



I married many men, a ton of them, and yet I was untrue to none of them,

because I bumped off ev'ry one of them to keep my love alive.



Sir Paul was frail, he looked a wreck to me.

At night he was a horse's nect to me,

so I performed an appendectomy,

to keep my love alive!



Sir Thomas had insomnia,

he couldn't sleep at night,

I bought a little arsenic,

he's sleeping now all right.



Sir Philip played the harp, I cussed the thing.

I crowned him with his harp to bust the thing,

and now he plays where harps are just the thing,

to keep my love alive, to keep my love alive.



I thought Sir George had possibilites,

but his flirtations made me ill at ease,

and when I'm ill at ease, I kill at ease

to keep my love alive.



Sir Charles came from a sanatorium,

and yelled for drinks in my emporium.

I mixed one drink, he's in memoriam,

to keep my love alive!



Sir Francis was a singing bird,

a night-in-gale,

That's why I tossed him off my balcony

to see if he could fly.



Sir Athelstane indulged in fratricide,

he killed his dad and that was patricide.

One night I stabbed him by my mattress side,

to keep my love alive, to keep my love alive.
