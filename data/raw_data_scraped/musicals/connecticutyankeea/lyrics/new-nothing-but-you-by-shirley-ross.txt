New Nothing But You by Shirley Ross


VERSE

When you walk into a room,

Then the room is light.

When you say anything, then

What you say is right.

If that is due to my singular condition

Well, then, that condition is my one ambition

I'm in love with you



REFRAIN

I woke up from a dream one day

And there was nothing but you.

I looked into my heart that day

And there was nothing but you.

You were there, so there was love,

Brave and bright and new.

When I look into life I see

Past and future, too-

Nothing there but you.



VERSE

When you walk into a room,

Then the room is light.

When you say anything, then

What you say is right.

If that is due to my singular condition

Well, then, that condition is my one ambition

I'm in love with you
