My Heart Stood Still


He:



I laughed at sweet-hearts

I met at schools;

All indiscreet hearts

Seemed romantic fools.

A house in Iceland

Was my heart's domain.

I saw your eyes;

Now Castles Rise in Spain!

She:



Through all my school days

I hated boys;

Those April Fool days

Brought me Loveless joys.

I read my Plato.

Love, I thought a sin;

But since your kiss,

I'm reading Missus Glynn!

Refrain



I took one look at you,

That's all I meant to do;

And then my heart stood still!

My feet could step and walk,

My lips could move and talk,

And yet my heart stood still!

Though not a single word was spoken,

I could tell you knew,

That unfelt clasp of hands

Told me so well you knew.

I never lived at all

Until the thrill of that moment when my heart stood still.
