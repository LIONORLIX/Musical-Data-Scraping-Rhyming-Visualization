We'll Follow the Old Man


We'll follow the old man wherever he wants to go

Long as he wants to go opposite to the foe



We'll stay with the old man wherever he wants to stay

Long as he stays away from the battle's fray



Because we love him, we love him

Especially when he keeps us on the ball



And we'll tell the kiddies we answered duty's call

With the grandest son of a soldier of them all
