Love and the Weather


[Verse:]

Unpredictable, irresponsible

Unbelievable, unreliable

Ever since the world began

Are Cupid and the weather man



[Refrain:]

Love and the weather, birds of a feather

Can't be depended upon

One day it's sunny, next day the sunshine has gone



Love and the weather, always together

Planning another surprise

Bringing the raindrops just like the tears to your eyes



There was I with love close by

So cozy and warm

Love walked out and so did I

Right out of the warm

Into a storm



Moonlight romances have to take chances

That's what I learned with the dawn

Love and the weather can't be depended upon



[Alternate Final Strain:]

Moonlight advances, love's golden chances

Rain comes along and they're gone

Love and the weather can't be depended upon
