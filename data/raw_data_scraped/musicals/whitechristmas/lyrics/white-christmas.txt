White Christmas


I'm dreaming of a white christmas,

just like the ones I used to know

Where the treetops glisten and children listen

to hear sleigh bells in the snow



I'm dreaming of a white christmas,

just like the ones I used to know

Where the treetops glisten and children listen

to hear sleigh bells in the snow



I'm dreaming of a white christmas,

with every christmas card I write

May your days be merry and bright,

and may all your christmases be white



I'm dreaming of a white christmas,

just like the ones I used to know

May your days be merry and bright,

and may all your christmases be white



I'm dreaming of a white christmas,

with every christmas card I write

May your days be merry and bright,

and may all your christmases be white



May your days be merry and bright,

and may all your christmases be white



And may all your christmases be white (All your christmases be white)

And may all your christmases be white (All your christmases be white)

And may all your christmases be

(All your christmases be white)

(All your christmases be white)
