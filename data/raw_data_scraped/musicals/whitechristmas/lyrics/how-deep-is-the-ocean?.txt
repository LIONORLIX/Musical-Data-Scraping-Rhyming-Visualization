How Deep Is The Ocean?


[Verse:]

How can I tell you what is in my heart?

How can I measure each and every part?

How can I tell you how much I love you?

How can I measure just how much I do?



[Refrain:]

How much do I love you? I'll tell you no lie

How deep is the ocean? How high is the sky?



How many times a day do I think of you?

How many roses are sprinkled with dew?



How far would I travel to be where you are?

How far is the journey from here to a star?



And if I ever lost you, how much would I cry?

How deep is the ocean? How high is the sky?
