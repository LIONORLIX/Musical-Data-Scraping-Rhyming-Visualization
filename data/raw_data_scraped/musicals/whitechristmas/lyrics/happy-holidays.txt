Happy Holiday

Happy Holiday

Happy Holiday

Why the merry bells keep ringing

May your every wish come true



Happy Holiday

Happy Holiday

May the calender keep bringing

Happy holiday to you



I'm dreaming of a white christmas

Just like the ones I used to know

Where the treetops glisten

And children listen

To hear sleigh bells in the snow



I'm dreaming of a white christmas

With every christmas card I write

May your days be merry and bright

And may all your christmases be white



Happy Holiday

Happy Holiday

Why the merry bells keep ringing

May your every wish come true



Happy Holiday

Happy Holiday

May the calender keep bringing

The most happy holiday to you
