Let Me Sing and I AM Happy


[Verse:]

What care I who makes the laws of a nation

Let those who will take care of its rights and wrongs

What care I who cares for the world's affairs

As long as I can sing its popular songs



[Refrain:]

Let me sing a funny song

With crazy words that roll along

And if my song can start you laughing

I'm happy, happy



Let me sing a sad refrain

Of broken hearts who love in vain

And if my song can start you crying

I'm happy



Let me croon a lowdown blues

That lifts you out of your seat

If my blues can reach your shoes

And start you tapping your feet

I'm happy



Let me sing of Dixie's charms

Of cotton fields and mammy's arms

And if my song can make you homesick

I'm happy



[Various alternate lines:]



Of broken hearts that loved in vain



To lift you out of your seat

If my song can reach your shoes



The Swanee shore and mother's arms
