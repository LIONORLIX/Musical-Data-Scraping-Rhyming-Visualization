Count Your Blessings


BOB:

When i'm worried and i can't sleep

i count my blessings instead of sheep and i fall asleep counting my blessings

when my bankroll is getting small i think of when i had none at all

and i fall asleep counting my blessings.



I think about a nursery,

and i picture curly heads,

and one by one i count them

as they slumber in their beds.



If you're worried and you cant sleep,

just count your blessings instead of sheep

and you'll fall asleep counting your blessings.



Betty:

if i'm worried an i cant sleep i count my blessings instead of sheep

and i fall asleep counting my bless-



BOB:

-if your worried and you can't sleep,



Bob & Betty:

Just count your blessings instead of sheep

and you'll fall asleep counting your blessings
