While The City Sleeps


EDDIE

While the city sleeps,

While the streets are clear,

There's a life that's happening here.

While the tourist dreams

In his Statler bed,

Here we're living those dreams instead.

Well, the clan has gathered,

Put a Stan Getz record on,

Send the judge for pizza,

When the last anchovy's gone,

Then it's dawn.

While the city sleeps,

While the air is still,

Life can bring you that secret thrill,

While the city sleeps,

While the city sleeps.



While the city sleeps,

When it's after four,

Conversation means so much more.

When the Scarsdale squares

All have said their prayers,

We receive what they're praying for.

Well, the juice is flowing,

Hear the native drums begin,

Bossa Nova going,

Hey, your lordship, where you been?

Stagger in.

While the city sleeps,

While the air is still,

Life can bring you that secret thrill,

While the city sleeps,

While the city sleeps,

While the city sleeps.
