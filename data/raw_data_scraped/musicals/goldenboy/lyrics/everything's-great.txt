Everything's Great


TOM

Everything's great,

Couldn't be better,

Up to my ears in debt.

Rent overdue,

Nothing but worries,

How great can things get?

Here I am, Thomas J. Moody,

Three year-old suit from Robert J. Hall.

Jesus H. Christ, where am I heading?

These lucky feet find the one street

That's guaranteed to lead to a brick wall.

Every old horse

Has to win sometime,

When is it my big purse?

Things have to change,

Gotta get better,

They could not get worse.



LORNA

Here I am, still getting nowhere,

Making believe it's all so divine.

Had to get hung on Mister Married,

Doing things right, that's not my line;

Screwing things up, that's where I shine.



TOM

Just what I need,

She's gonna kill me,

Milking me dry, my wife.



BOTH

Everything's great,

Couldn't be better...



TOM

Birds are singing...



LORNA

(Vultures, maybe...)



TOM

Flowers blooming...



LORNA

(Poison ivy...)



BOTH

What a perfect life.
