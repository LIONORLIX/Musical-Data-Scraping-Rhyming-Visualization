Golden Boy


LORNA

You're the boy who wanted everything.

Golden boy, there's no golden ring.

The things you need you need too much,

The love you feel you feel too much,

So when you're hurt it hurts too much, I know.

Golden boy, you think you need me so.

Little boy, too naive to know

Weary girls like me have nothing left,

So how could we give something to

Golden boys like you?



Is it all too late, or could I find

The strength somehow to see it through

With a boy like you?
