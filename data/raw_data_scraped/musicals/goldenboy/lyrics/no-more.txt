No More


JOE & CHORUS

I gave you my soul --

No more.

Now I'll kiss your eyes

No more.

How I trusted you!

Now I ask what for.

You were life to me --

No more.



Well, you had your chance --

No more.

Now I'll play the fool

No more.

How I needed love,

But you closed the door.

Oh, you'll laugh at me

No more.



How I bled for you!

No more.

Shed my skin for you!

No more.

Oh, I worshipped you,

That you can't ignore,

But I ain't your slave

No more.



Well, you had your way --

No more.

Well, it ain't your day

No more.

Yes, I'm standin' up,

I ain't on the floor,

I ain't bowin' down

No more.



I ain't gonna cry

No more.

No, I ain't gonna cry

No more.

I just wanted love,

Why'd it turn to war?

I ain't bowin' down

No more.
