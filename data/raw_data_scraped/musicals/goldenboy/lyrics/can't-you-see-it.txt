Can't You See It


JOE

Can't you see it?

It's clear as it can be,

It makes a sunny beam of light

That seems to follow me.

Can't you hear it?

Sopranos everywhere,

A chorus of the choicest voices

Singing in the air.

It makes the soot underfoot flash like diamonds,

And every cop dances by like Fred Astaire.

Can't you see it?

It's blazed across the sky!

If you can see it,

You're as happy as I.



Can't you see it?

It's pleasanter than spring,

It's what the humble peasant felt

The day they made him king.

It makes the fumes from the bus smell like roses,

And every bum on a bench sings just like Bing.

Can't you see it?

It's blazed across the sky!

If you can see it,

You're as happy as I.
