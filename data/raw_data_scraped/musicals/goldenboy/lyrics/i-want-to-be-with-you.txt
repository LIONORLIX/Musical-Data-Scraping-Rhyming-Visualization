I Want To Be With You


JOE

Lorna...

Lorna and Joe...

Somehow it sounds so right,

Somehow you feel what I feel too.

I want to be with you.



I want to be with you,

I want to be with you.

After all the nights of wanting you,

Lying there, loving you, hating you,

Tonight I'm touching you, holding you,

World, you're gonna see,

We'll get by somehow,

Here's my girl and me,

They can't hurt us now.

We're gonna have it all,

I'll love you every day.

Lorna, life can be so great for us,

Here's our chance, it's not too late for us,

Grab it fast or life won't wait for us,

I want to be with you,

I want to be with you.



LORNA

You make me want to sing,

You make me want to cry.

Joe, I didn't want to feel again,

And here I am, scared again, real again,

I want to be with you, stay with you,

With you every day,

With you right or wrong,

With you every way,

With you I am strong.



JOE

I will be so good to you,

I still can't believe...



BOTH

That's how it's gonna be...



JOE

That's how it's gonna be,

My loving girl and me.



BOTH

And we'll tell the world "Make way for us,"

It's a sweet and golden day for us,

Now the music starts to play for us,

I want to be with you,

I want to be with you.
