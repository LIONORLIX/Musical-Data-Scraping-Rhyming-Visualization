I Still See Elisa


I still see Elisa

She keeps on returning

As breathless, young as ever



I still see Elisa

And still feel the yearning

To hold her against me again



Her heart was made of holidays

Her smile was made of dawn

Her laughter was an April song

That echoes on and on



Since I saw Elisa

The shadows are falling

And winter is calling above

But I still see Elisa



Whenever I dream of love
