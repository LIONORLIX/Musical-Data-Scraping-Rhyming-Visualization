I Talk to the Trees


I talk to the trees

But they don't listen to me

I talk to the stars

But they never hear me



The breeze hasn't time

To stop, and hear what I say

I talk to them all

In vain



But suddenly, my words

Reach someone elses ear

At someone elses heart

Strings too



I tell you my dreams

And while you're listening to me

I suddenly see them

Come true



I can see us some April night

Looking out across a rollin' farm

Having supper in the candlelight

Walking later, arm in arm



Then I'll tell you

How I pass the day

Thinking mainly how

The night would be



Then I'll try to find

The words to say

All the things you

Mean to me



I tell you my dreams

And while you're

Listening to me

I suddenly see them

Come true
