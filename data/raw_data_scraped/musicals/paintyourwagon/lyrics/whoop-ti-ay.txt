Whoop-Ti-Ay


Mr. Rumson went to town

Riding on a pony

Bought a wife and brought her home

And called it matrimony



Mr. Rumson bought a bride

Out in Californee

He'd of saved alot of money

Staying drunk and horny



Oh, Susanna, he's happy as can be

For he's got him something

Better than a banjo on his knee



Rumson, he got married today

Married today, married today

Rumson, he got married today

What'll he do tomorrow?



Get the soap man water, whoop-ti-ay!

Get the soap man water, whoop-ti-ay!

Got a sweet perfumer

To dry his humor

It's Ben's wedding day



Wash him down and flip him, whoop-ti-ay!

Wash him down and flip him, whoop-ti-ay!

He's got a blue-eyed wonder

To pull him under



It's Ben's wedding

His wedding

His wedding day

Amen!
