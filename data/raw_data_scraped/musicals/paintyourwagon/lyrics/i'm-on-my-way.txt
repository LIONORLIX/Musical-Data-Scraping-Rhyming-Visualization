Gold!!



Gotta dream boy

Gotta song

Paint your wagon

And come along



Where am I goin'?

I don't know

Where am I headin'?

I ain't certain

All I know

Is I am on my way



When will I be there?

I don't know

When will I get there?

I ain't certain

All that I know

Is I am on my way



Gotta dream boy

Gotta song

Paint your wagon

[And come along - Sung In German]



[Verse sung in German]



[Verse sung in Chinese]



[Verse sung in American Indian]



Gotta dream boy

Gotta song

Paint your wagon

And come along



Where am I goin'?

I don't know

When will I be there?

I ain't certain

What will I get?

I ain't equipped to say



But who gives a damn?

Who gives a damn?

Who gives a damn?

We're on our way



Where am I goin'?

I don't know

Where am I headin'?

I ain't certain

All that I know

Is I am on my way



When will I be there?

I don't know

When will I get there?

I ain't certain

All that I know

Is I am on my way



-Instrumental-



When am I goin'?

I don't know

Where am I headin'?

I ain't certain

All that I know

Is I am on my way



When will I be there?

I don't know

When will I get there?

I ain't certain

All that I know

Is I am on my way



Gotta dream boy

Gotta song

Paint your wagon

And come along



Where are we goin'?

I don't know

When will we be there?

I ain't certain

What will we get?

I ain't equipped to say

But who gives a damn?

Who gives a damn?

We're on our way!
