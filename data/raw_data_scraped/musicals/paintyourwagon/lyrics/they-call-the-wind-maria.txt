They Call the Wind Maria


Mariah

Mariah

They call the wind Mariah



Away out here they got a name

For rain and wind and fire

The rain is Tess, the fire Joe,

And they call the wind Mariah



Mariah blows the stars around

And sends the clouds a-flyin?

Mariah makes the mountains sound

Like folks were up there dying



Mariah

Mariah

They call the wind Mariah



Before I knew Mariah's name

And heard her wail and whinin?

I had a girl and she had me

And the sun was always shinin?



But then one day I left my girl

I left her far behind me

And now I'm lost, so gone and lost

Not even God can find me



Mariah

Mariah

They call the wind Mariah



Out here they got a name for rain

For wind and fire only

But when you're lost and all alone

There ain't no word but lonely



And I'm a lost and lonely man

Without a star to guide me

Mariah blow my love to me

I need my girl beside me



Mariah

Mariah

They call the wind Mariah



Mariah

Mariah!

Blow my love to me
