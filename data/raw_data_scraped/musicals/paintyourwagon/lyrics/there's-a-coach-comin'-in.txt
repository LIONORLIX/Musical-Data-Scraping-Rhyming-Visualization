There's a Coach Comin' In


There's a coach comin' in!

There's a coach comin' in!

Comin in!

Comin in!

Comin in!

Comin in!

Comin in!



There's a coach comin' in

If you listen you can hear it

A clip-cloppin' over the hill

And the sound that you hear

Is as good to your ear

As the call of a wild whippoorwill



There's a coach comin' in

You can feel it gettin' near

All at once then it bursts into view

And it looks to your eye

Like it fell from the sky

Like a coach full of dreams come true



For it's bringin' me eyes that are moonlight

And it's carryin' lips that are wine (kiss sound)

And it's comin' with arms that are pillows

And this evening it all will be mine



There's a coach comin' in

And you're smellin' like a steer

Yet the soap tub remains far away

Cut the socks from your feet

Cut the socks from your feet

Rake your hair till it's neat

Rake your hair till it's neat

There's a coach comin' in

There's a coach comin' in today!



There's a coach comin' in

Hurry! Hurry! Do ya hear?

With a cargo of joy from Paree

Drop the tables and chairs

Get them beds up the stairs

And be sure every lock has a key



-Instrumental-



For it's coming with girls who buy perfume

Who wear powder and rouge from Paree

Who will have to go somewhere to get them

And that somewhere to go, will be me



There's a coach comin' in

And it's flyin' like a deer

Thank the Lord, there's relief on the way

Thank with all of your hearts

Thank with all of your hearts

For them half dozen tarts

For them half dozen tarts

There's a coach comin' in

There's a coach comin in today!



There's a coach comin' in

If you listen you can hear it

A clip-cloppin' over the hill

And the sound that you hear

Is as good to the ear

As the call of the wild whippoorwill



-Instrumental-



For it's bringin' me eyes that are moonlight

And it's carryin' lips that are wine

It's comin' with arms that are pillows

And this evening it all will be mine



-Instrumental-



There's a coach comin' in

If you listen you can hear it

A clip, up and over the hill

And the sound that you hear

Is as good to your ear

As the call of the wild whippoorwill



There's a coach comin' in

You can feel it gettin' near

All at once, then it bursts into view

And it looks to your eye

Like it fell from the sky

Like a coach full of dreams come true



For it's bringin' me eyes that are moonlight

And it's carryin' lips that are wine

And it's comin' with arms that are pillows

And this evening it all will be mine



There's a coach comin' in

Now it's flyin' in the clear

And the sun almost closes the day

Now there ain't pots of gold

Now they're all livin' gold

There's a coach comin' in

There's a coach comin' in

It's here!
