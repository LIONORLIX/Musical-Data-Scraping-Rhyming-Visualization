Difficult And Dangerous Times


Molokov & Diplomats:

No one can deny that

These are difficult times.

No one can deny that

These are difficult times.



Molokov: [Spoken]

Miss Vassy.



Florence: [Spoken]

Mr. Molokov.



Diplomats:

It's the U.S. versus U.S.S.R.

Yet we more or less are.



No one can deny that

These are difficult times.



To our credit putting all that aside

We have swallowed our pride.



These are very dangerous,

And difficult times.



Florence:

It really doesn't matter

Who comes on top.



Molokov:

Who gets the chop.



Molokov & Diplomats:

No one's way of life

Is threatened

By a flop.

But we're going to

Smash that bastard.

Make him wanna

Change his name.

Take him to the cleaners

And devastate him,

Wipe him out,

Humiliate him.

We don't want

The whole world saying

"They can't even win a game."



Walter:

We have never reckoned

On coming second.



Molokov:

There's no use in

Losing.

It's the red flag up against

Stars and stripes,

But we're peace-loving types.



Diplomats:

No one can deny that

These are difficult times.



Florence:

It's a sweet

Hail-fellow-well-met

Affair.



Walter:

For both eagle and bear.



Diplomats:

These are very dangerous

And difficult times.



Molokov:

For those who say that

This is not a friendly clash--

Don't be so rash.

I assure you, comrades,

That is balderdash.



Molokov & Dilpomats:

What a load of

Whingeing peasants!

Thinking they can win--

They can't!

What an exhibition

Of self-delusion.

This one's a forgone

Conclusion.

But enough of all this beating

Round the bushes of detente.

We intend to collar

The Yankee dollar.

We shall thrash them!



All:

Trash them!



Molokov:

How good to feel that

As this great event begins

it underpins

Our quest for peace--

The bonds of common interest

Of East and West.



All:

As long as our man wins.

As long as our man wins.
