Where I Want To Be


Anatoly:

Who needs a dream?

Who needs ambition?

Who'd be the fool

In my position?

Once I had dreams,

Now they're obsessions.

Hopes became needs--

Lovers possessions.



Then they move in

Oh so discreetly,

Slowly at first--

Smiling too sweetly.

I opened doors

They walked right through them.

Called me their friend--

I hardly knew them.



Now I'm

Where I want to be,

And who I want to be,

And doing what I

Always said I would,

And yet I feel

I haven't won at all.

Running for my life,

And never looking back

In case there's someone

Right behind to shoot me down

And say he always knew I'd fall.



When the crazy wheel

Slows down,

Where will I be?

Back where I started.



Don't get me wrong,

I'm not complaining.

Times have been good--

Fast, entertaining.

But what's the point

If I'm concealing

Not only love,

All other feeling?



Now I'm

Where I want to be,

And who I want to be,

And doing what I

Always said I would,

And yet I feel

I haven't won at all.

I'm running for my life,

And never looking back

In case there's someone

Right behind to shoot me down

And say he always knew I'd fall.



When the crazy wheel

Slows down,

Where will I be?

Back where I started.



Viigand: [Spoken]

Comrade, Molokov tells me you want to play chess.



Anatoly: [Spoken]

Go to hell.
