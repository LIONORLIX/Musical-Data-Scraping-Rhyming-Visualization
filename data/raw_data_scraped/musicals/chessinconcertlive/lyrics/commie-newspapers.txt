Commie Newspapers


Florence:

Well we can't complain

that you've been ignored by the press.



Freddie:

What'd they say? What'd they say?



Florence:

They're not too polite...



Freddie:

They say I'm a shit?



Florence:

Well, yes. They pulled you to pieces...

In five different languages,

The Times: "You thrive on unpleasantness."



FLORENCE: (In French)

"Le Monde: Freddie Trumper, La Honte des ?cheques."



FREDDIE:

I can't believe that they don't see my game.

I'm like that tennis player, what's his name?

They love to hate me and for us,

That's dollars!



FLORENCE: (In German)





FREDDIE:

Hey look here's some piece that

Some idiot's written on you.



"Florence Vassey: petite, Hungarian-born personal assistant."



"His gentle companion..."

Ha! If they only knew.



FLORENCE:

What do you mean? I'm always gentle with you, Freddie!



FREDDIE AND FLORENCE:

"She stands

By her champion."



FREDDIE:

I like this!



FREDDIE AND FLORENCE:

"Whose demands

Are so infantile."



FREDDIE:

I don't like this.



FLORENCE:

If you don't like it then it's up to you.

They like the Russian they could like you too.



FREDDIE:

Commie newspapers!



Of course the bastards all support

the Russian.



FLORENCE:

But Sergievsky seems a sweet opponent.

So why do you abuse him all the time?



Freddie, I love you very much but please,

just for once, don't go on about the Russians at the press conference, okay?
