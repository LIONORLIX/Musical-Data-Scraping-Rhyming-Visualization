You And I (Reprise)


ANATOLY:

Knowing I want you

Knowing I love you

Can not compare

To my despair

Knowing I?ve lost you



FLORENCE:

I've been a fool to allow

Dreams to become

Great expectations



ANATOLY:

How can I love you so much

Yet make no move?



BOTH:

There will be days and nights

When I want you

More than I want to

More than I should

More than I want to



You and I we've seen it all

Chasing our hearts' desire

But we go on pretending

Stories like ours

Have happy endings



ANATOLY:

You could not give me

More than you gave me

I don?t know why

I?m standing by

Watching this happen



FLORENCE:

I won't look back anymore

And if I do-just for a moment



ANATOLY:

I can?t imagine time

When I won?t care



BOTH:

But here we are today, and it?s over

Hold me and tell me

We?ll meet again

One happy moment



You and I

We've seen it all

Chasing our hearts' desire

But we go on pretending

Stories like ours

Have happy endings
