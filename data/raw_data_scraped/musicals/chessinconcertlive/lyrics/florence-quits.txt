Frederick: [Spoken]

Five games to one. It's all over.



[Sung]

So you got

What you want.

What a nasty ambition.

Set me up,

Pull me down,

Then exploit my condition.



I should have guessed, woman,

That if pressed, woman,

You're on nobody's side

But your own.

And you're behaving

Like a mere woman,

It's so clear, woman,

It's your sex!

Once they start

Getting old,

And getting worried,

They let fly,

Take it out

On the one

Who supports them--

That's you

I'm talking about.



Florence:

Who'd ever guess it?

Such a squalid little ending--

Watching you descending

Just as far as you can go.

I'm learning

Things I didn't want to know.



Frederick & Florence:

Who'd ever think it?

This would be the situation.



Frederick:

One more observation--



Frederick & Florence:

How'd we ever get this far

Before you showed me

What you really are?



Florence:

You'll be lost without me

To abuse like you're used to.



Frederick:

Go away!

Just get out!

Be someone else's

Parasite!
