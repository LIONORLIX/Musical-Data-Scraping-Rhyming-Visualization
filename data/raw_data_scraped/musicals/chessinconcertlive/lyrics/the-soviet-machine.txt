The Soviet Machine


Molokov: [Spoken]

Comrades, why are you looking so worried? We are not

dealing with the traitor Sogievsky now. Comrade Viigand

is a disciplined, Soviet, chess-playing machine.



[Sung]

Just in case you feel a trace

Of doubt or even nervous tension,

Let me draw the latest score

To your attention.

Not the score,

The witless core of commentators are debating.

Come, admit,

Who gives a shit for Elo rating.

No, I prefer

And I'm sure you concur,

To see who is ahead

Psychologically, for example,

We have on tap,

An inscrutable chap

Whose thoughts never stray

From the state of the play.



All:

Viigand!!



Molokov: [Spoken]

Whereas...



[Sung]

It's so difficult to concentrate if

You have left your native

Country for a woman

Who has plans of her own.

It's not easy for a chap to excel,

Feeling guilty as hell,

Having left his wife

To face the music alone.

But, even worse,

Imagine if his ladies met,

Well then I'll bet,

The atmosphere 'round here

Would be a little strained,

As she explained.

[Claps]

How could he do

What he's done to those two,

Most wonderful girls.

Yes, I love you both.



Soloists:

Most amusing!



Molokov:

Starting them scratch

They'll torpedo his match,

His horsepower dead

On the board and in bed.



All:

Bit by bit the pieces fit,

The Soviet machine advances.

Not one move that

Won't improve our nation's chances.

We predict a stunning victory

On the board and off it.

This will show that traitor

No one rats with profit.



But we're going

To smash that bastard.

Make him wanna change his name.

Take him to the cleaners

And devastate him,

Wipe him out,

Humiliate him.



We don't want the

Whole world saying

"They can't even win a game."

We have never

Reckoned on coming second.



Molokov:

There's no use in Soloists:

Losing. We can feel the flame

Of triumph burning,

Bit by bit the pieces fit, Our people's pride returning.

The soviet machine

Advances.



All:

Not one move that won't

Improve our nation's chances.

Hoi!



Molokov:

No, I prefer and

I'm sure you concur,

To see who is ahead

Psychologically, for example,

We have on tap,

An inscrutable chap

Whose thoughts never stray

From the state of the play.



All:

La la la la, la la lay la lay la

La la la la la la la la la la la



Bit by bit the pieces fit,

The soviet machine advances.

Not one move that won't

Improve our nation's chances.

Hey!

We predict a stunning victory

On the board and off it.

This will show that traitor

No one rats with profit.



Ah ah, la la la la!



Molokov:

From Moscow to

The Bering Strait,

Citizens will hail

Our victory.



All:

In arctic circles,

Frozen states

Will join with

Warmer climes in reverie.



Molokov:

And I can say of this affair

I was there,

Did my share,

Played my part.



All:

And comrades

All will be aware

I was there

From the start

Mmm mmm...



Viigand:

Ah ah...
