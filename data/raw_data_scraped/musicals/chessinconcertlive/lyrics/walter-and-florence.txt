Walter And Florence


Walter: [Spoken]

So in the end our hero won brilliantly. Surprised us all.

He's played as well as he's ever done.



Florence: [Spoken]

No surprise.



Walter: [Spoken]

Well this is--

He's just announced he's going back to the soviet union.

He seems unable to win without the added thrill of changing sides.

Don't you have a single word to say?



Florence: [Spoken]

No... No.

[Sung]

No, you wouldn't listen anyhow,

And what I'm feeling now

Has no easy explanations.

Hasn't this been a great achievement?

Losing you man and nothing in return.



Walter: [Spoken]

Well, not my man, it's your man. Anyway, Anatoly's

return to the soviet union is a very descent gesture.

It's vertualy assured us some very important collateral--

Including you father. He must have done it for you.

He wouldn't have done it for me. We'll get your father out--

if he's still alive.
