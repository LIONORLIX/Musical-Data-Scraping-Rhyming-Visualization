Anatoly And The Press


Reporter #3: [Spoken]

Excuse me, Mr. Sergievsky, why are you leaving

Russia? What about your wife and family?



Reporters:

How long was this planned?

What made you defect?

Did anyone help you?

And do you expect

To be joined in your exile

By loved ones, e.g. your wife?

Or are you starting again

In all aspects of life?



Reporter #7: [Spoken]

Will you be defending your title next year in

Bangkok?



Anatoly: [Spoken]

Walter, you bastard, you never told me you and

Global would fix all this!



Walter: [Spoken]

Welcome to the West, Anatoly.



Reporter #6: [Spoken]

Why did you leave Russia?



Anatoly: [Spoken]

I don't leave anything!
