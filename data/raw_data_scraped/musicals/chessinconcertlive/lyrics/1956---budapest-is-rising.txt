1956 - Budapest Is Rising


Chorus:

1956 - Budapest is rising.



Freddie:

I'd have thought you'd support                   Chorus:

Any attack on these people.                  1956 - Budapest is rising.

On the people who ran

Mindlessly over your childhood.

Don't let them fool you

For 30 years on,

They're the same.



Chorus:

1956 - Budapest is fighting.

1956 - Budapest is falling.



Freddie:

They see chess as a war                               Chorus:

Playing with pawns just like Poland.               1956 - Budapest is dying.

If you walk out on me

You're really betraying you father.

Were he alive now he'd surely

Be dying of shame.



Florence:

You know that there's nothing I've done

That he'd be ashamed of

In my whole life!

Why'd you have to do this to me?
