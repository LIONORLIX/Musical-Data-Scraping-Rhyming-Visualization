Nobody's Side


Florence:

What's going on around me

Is barely making sense,

I need some explanations fast!



I see my present partner

In the imperfect tense,

And I don't see how we can last.



I feel I need a change of cast

Maybe I'm on nobody's side,

And when he gives me reasons

To justify each move,

They're getting harder to believe.



I know this can't continue,

I've still a lot to prove,

There must be more I could achieve.

But I don't have the nerve to leave!



Florence & Chorus:

Everybody's playing the game,

But nobody's rules are the same,

Nobody's on nobody's side.



Better learn to go it alone,

Recognize you're out on your own,

Nobody's on nobody's side.



Florence:

The one I should not think of

Keeps rolling through my mind,

And I don't want to let that go!



No lover's ever faithful,

No contract truly signed,

There's nothing certain left to know.

And how the cracks begin to show!



Florence & Chorus:

Never make a promise or plan,

Take a little love where you can,

Nobody's on nobody's side.



Never stay too long in your bed,

Never lose your heart, use your head!

Nobody's on nobody's side.



Florence:

Side!

Never take a stranger's advice,

Never let a friend fool you twice, ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^Chorus:

Nobody's on nobody's side.^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^Nobody's on nobody's side.



Florence & Chorus:

Never be the first to believe,

Never be the last to deceive,

Nobody's on nobody's side.



Florence:                                                     Chorus:

Never leave a moment too soon,                    Never leave a moment too soon,

Never waste a hot afternoon,                         Never waste a hot afternoon,

Nobody's on nobody's side,

Never stay too long!                                     Never stay a minute too long.



Florence & Chorus:

Don't forget the best will go wrong,

Nobody's on nobody's side!
