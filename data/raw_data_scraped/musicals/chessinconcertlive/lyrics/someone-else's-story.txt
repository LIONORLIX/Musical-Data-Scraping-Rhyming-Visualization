Someone Else's Story


Long ago

In someone else's lifetime

Someone with my name

Who looked a lot like me

Came to know

A man and made a promise

He only had to say

And that's where she would be

Lately

Although her feelings run just as deep

The promise she made has grown impossible to keep

And yet I wish it wasn't so

Will he miss me if I go?



In a way

It's someone else's story

I don't see myself

As taking part at all

Yesterday

A girl that I was fond of

Finally could see

The writing on the wall

Sadly

She realized she'd left him behind

And sadder than that she knew he wouldn't even mind

And though there's nothing left to say

Would he listen if I stay?



It's all very well to say you fool it's now or never

I could be choosing

No choices whatsoever



I could be

In someone else's story

In someone else's life

And he could be in mine

I don't see

A reason to be lonely

I should take my chances

Further down the line

And if

That girl I knew should ask my advice

Oh I wouldn't hesitate she needn't ask me twice

Go now!

I'd tell her that for free

Trouble is, the girl is me

The story is, the girl is me
