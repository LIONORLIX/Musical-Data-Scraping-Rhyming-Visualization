The Arbiter (Reprise)


The Arbiter:

I'm on the case,

Can't be fooled.

Any objection

Is overruled.



Don't try to tempt me,

You've no hope.

I don't like women,

And I don't take dope.

I'm the Arbiter,

My word is law.



The Arbiter & Soloists:

From square one--

From square one

I'll be watching you.
