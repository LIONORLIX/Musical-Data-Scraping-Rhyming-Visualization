The Interview


Walter:

We all want times in our careers,

When we make a little history.

Receive the plaudits of our peers,

Perhaps that time is here right now for me.

Ah Anatoly, if I may, let me say right away,

You will be thrilled, because the other seat is filled

By a long-standing friend of yours.

Action!



Frederick:

Well, here we are face to face once again.



Anatoly:

By any standards, a bizarre reunion!



Frederick:

Is being homeless affecting your game?



Anatoly:

I wouldn't know, as I have a home in England.



Frederick:

No, by a home I mean real home--the place where your family is.



Anatoly: [Spoken]

England is my real home.



Frederick:

What are your latest political aims?



Anatoly:

What are you saying?



Frederick:

Your anti-Russian crusade, has it worked?



Anatoly:

I am no crusader.



Frederick:

What is your true motivation?

That is something we all want to know.



Anatoly: [Spoken]

You know damn well what my motivation is, okay?



Frederick:

Here we see a man under great pressure--

Two fights to fight, yet he could not look fresher.

Chess and politics, I take my hat off.

To any champion, who can pull that off?



I hear your second controls everything.



Anatoly:

Chess is her passion.



Frederick:

But her obsession is East versus West.



Anatoly:

Chess is her passion.



Frederick:

I know a little about her,

And she has got her own ax to grind.



Anatoly: [Spoken]

That is not true.



Frederick:

Aren't you concerned that why your wife is not here?



Anatoly:

I don't discuss my private life in public.



Frederick:

But don't you care that she is not by your side?



Anatoly:

I think I've had enough of this discussion!



Frederick:

Well, we've a little surprise.

We've got your wife on the video.



Walter: [Spoken]

Run the video!



Frederick:

Let her talk to you, give you her version--

How married life has changed, since your desertion.

Hey come back, my friend, we are only showing

Home movies--nothing more, where are you going?



Walter: [Spoken]

Great interview!



Molokov: [Spoken]

Bravo, Mr, de Courcy--Walter!



Walter: [Spoken]

Ah, Alexander!



Molokov: [Spoken]

I am glad that old film did the trick.

We are going to be able to help each other.



Walter: [Spoken]

Heartwarming international cooperation.



Molokov: [Spoken]

I have good news about Anatoly's lady friend.

Florence Vassy's father is alive.



Walter: [Spoken]

Really? Well, this is good news. Have you told her yet?



Molokov: [Spoken]

No, I was going to leave that pleasure to you.

However, my friend, there is one thing-



Walter: [Spoken]

Yes, of course there is.



Molokov: [Spoken]

I think Mr. Sergievsky must lose the match and come home.

Do you not agree?



Walter: [Spoken]

Sure, but there are others beside Vassy we wish to see come home.



Molokov: [Spoken]

That should not be a problem. Do we have a deal?



Walter: [Spoken]

We have a deal, and everybody wins.



Molokov: [Spoken]

Except Anatoly.



Walter: [Spoken]

But he gets the lovely Svetlana
