Florence And Molokov


Florence:

You wanna lose your only friend, well keep it up you're doing fine!

This humiliation, why treat me like a fool?

I've taken shit for seven years and I won' t take it anymore!



Freddie:

I'm only teasing soviets

with gentle bon ami

And you've got better reason

to be anti them than me.



Florence:

There's a time and there's a place!



Freddie:

Well how 'bout here and now?

Are you for me or are you for them?



Florence:

There's a time and there's a place!
