Merano/What A Scene! What A Joy!


Citizens of Merano:

Oh, light the heart

That lingers in Merano.

Merano! The spa no

Connoisseur of spas

Would miss.

So healthy,

Highly recommended,

Is this sweet metropolis.

Mental and physical bliss.



The gods have smiled,

And blessed is Merano.

Merano! There are no

Fitter burghers to be found.

Such vigor!

Take the time to taste us--

We'll give you a welcome

That's typically Tyrol

For then we are sure

Of our ground.

Right now we're Italian--

We used to be German,

The border keeps

Mayor of Merano:

Shifting around.

Speaking as one of the patriarchs,

I don't mind taking your lira or marks.

Oh, I get high when

I saunter by

The mountains of Merano.

Rosy-cheeked Merano

Flourishing to a fault.

The sparkling streams,

The bracing air,

The therapeutic salt.

I'd have to be carried away

To call a halt!



Oh, I feel great

In this bouncing state.

All hail to thee, Merano

Hearty hale Merano--



Girls:

[Spoken]

Any objections?



Guys:

[Spoken]

Nein!



Where breathing in

Will turn you on.

Where water tastes like wine.

Get up your get up and go

And get in line!

It's living your life in a show

By Roger and Hammerstein.



Oh, sad the soul

Who passes by Merano.

Merano! So far no

Soul has ever passed us by.

They love us.

Why not stay forever?

Oh, so many reason why,

All those in favor say "Aye"

Aye!



So sing a song.

Let's hear it for Merano.

Merano! Soprano,

Alto, tenor, bass

Agree!

We're wholesome.

What a happy haven!

This is a place

Where your arteries soften--

Cholesterol hasn't a chance.

From mountain to valley

The natural goodness

Mayor of Merano:

Is fighting pollution's advance.

So come to us and feel the force,



All major credit cards taken of course.

Oh, I get high when

I saunter by

The mountains of Merano.

Rosy-cheeked Merano

Flourishing to a fault.

The sparkling streams,

The bracing air,

The therapeutic salt.

I'd have to be carried away

To call a halt!



Once in a while

All the gods will smile

On little old Merano.

Humble, shy Merano

Suddenly hits the press.

And I report with all the pride

And joy that I possess:

Half of the world and his wife

Has our address!

Our little town will be rife

With games of chess!



[Whistling]



Get up your get up and go

And get in line!

It's living your life in a show

By Rogers and Hammerstein!



Frederick:

What a scene,

What a joy,

What a lovely sight

When my game is

The big sensation!

Has the mob's sporting taste

Altered overnight?

Have they found

New sophistication?



Florence:

Not yet!

They just want to see

If the nice guy

Beats the bum.

If it's East-West,

And the money's sky high



Florence & Frederick:

They all come.



Frederick:

You can raise all you want,

If you raise the roof

Scream and shout,

And the gate increases.

Break the rules,

Break the bank,

I'm the living proof

They don't care

How I move my pieces.

Well, I know I'm the best there is,

But all they want is a show.

Well, that's all right,

I'll be glad to oblige--



Florence & Frederick:

SRO

SRO!



Citizens of Merano:

Oh, I get high when

I saunter by

The mountains of Merano.

Rosy-cheeked Merano

Flourishing to a fault.

The sparkling streams,

The bracing air,

The therapeutic salt.

I'd have to be carried away

To call a halt!



Oh, I feel great

In this bouncing state.

All hail to thee, Merano

Hearty hale Merano--

Now for the sell:

We put the ice into paradise,

We are the salt of the Earth

Sound as a bell,

Check out the waters,

And check out the hygiene

At which we excel.

Check into a hotel

And schnell

Body and soul get well!
