Embassy Lament


Embassy Officials:

Oh, my dear how boring,

He's defecting

Just like all the others,

He's expecting

Us to be impressed

With what he's done here,

But he hasn't stopped

To think about the paperwork

His gesture causes--

We've an embassy to run here.



If these people can't strike

Blows for freedom

With a valid visa,

We don't need 'em.

If we seem offhand

Then please remember

This is nothing very special--

He's the fourth we've had

Since last November.

Who do these foreign

Chappies think they are?



Official #1:

And when he's safely in the West

He'll be the hero to discuss.

The media will lionize him,

Fame and fortune plus,



Officials:

No-one will recall it's

Thanks to us.



Official #1: [Spoken]

You have a wife?



Anatoly: [Spoken]

Yes.



Official #3: [Spoken]

You have two children?



Anatoly: [Spoken]

Yes.



Official #2: [Spoken]

And they're not coming with you?



Anatoly: [Spoken]

No, not for the moment.



Official #4: [Spoken]

You play chess. You are good at it?

[Official #3 whispers in #4's ear]

Oh. I hear you're world champion.



Anatoly: [Spoken]

Since yesterday.



Officials: [Spoken]

That's still good.

[Sung]

Have you an appointment

With the consul?

If you don't

We know what his

Response'll be,

He will not see you--

With respect it buggers up

His very taxing schedule,

Pushing peace and understanding.

Let us hope this won't affect it.



Far too many joker

Cross the border,

Not a single

Document in order.

Russia must be empty

Though we're all for

Basic human rights,

It makes you wonder,

What they built the Berlin wall for--

Who do these foreign

Chappies think they are?



And when you've

Filled in all the forms,

And been passed

Clear of all disease,

Debriefed, debugged,

Dedrugged, disarmed,

And disinfected, please

Don't forget the guys

Who cut your keys.
