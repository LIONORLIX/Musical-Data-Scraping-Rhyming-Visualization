One More Opponent


Anatoly:

But why is he really here?

A whole year of silence and suddenly here he is



Florence: (Spoken)

He's workking for Global, it's big money!



Anatoly:

So that's all it is then

He has no desire to see you anymore?



Florence:

Who cares what he's up to, you're not playing him



Anatoly:

Although I have a feeling I am

(Spoken)

Why is he here?



Florence:

Don't talk yourself out of form

Vegan's the one

You have to meet



Anatoly:

He's a fine player



Florence:

Predictable, he's a machine



Anatoly: (Spoken)

Yes, a very fine machine



Florence:

So are you

So are we

But there is one other thing



Anatoly: (Spoken)

What?



Florence:

I gather Svetlana is planning to come out here



Anatoly: (Spoken)

My wife? Come to Bangkok? No



Florence: (Spoken)

You must know about it

(Sung)

It's been in the paper they might let her out



Anatoly:

This has to be Molokov right up his street



Florence:

So now you've got one more opponent to beat

Surely you knew



Anatoly:

I did not



Florence:

Well this is a problem we knew we'd be facing soon



Anatoly:

But not now

Not now
