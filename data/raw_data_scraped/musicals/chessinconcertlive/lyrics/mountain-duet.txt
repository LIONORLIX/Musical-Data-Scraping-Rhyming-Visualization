Mountain Duet


Florence:

This is the one situation

I wanted most to avoid

Nothing I say will convince him

This isn't a trick.



Anatoly:

A drink on clear moonlit night--

I relax, she smiles,

There's something peculiar

Going on.



Florence:

So through no fault of my own

I'm stuck here to carry the can.

Embarrassed, uncertain, marooned.



Anatoly:

Now she can't be working for them--

I mean us--

She seems to know what she's doing,

But where is he?



Florence:

He has to turn up,

He wanted this meeting,

Didn't he?



Anatoly:

Maybe he's scared,

But he didn't seem scared

In the game.



Florence:

Oh, I just couldn't care less.

He can go right ahead,

Go and wreck his career,

I know I've done my best.



Anatoly:

Well, at least

She's a good looking spy.



Florence:

What if my Russian friend

Thinks that my plans

Are more of an intimate kind?

If I don't say something

And soon

He'll go.

Maybe I'm on nobody's side!



Anatoly:

Listen, I hate to break up the mood.

Get to the point,

Begin the beguine.

Haven't you noticed

We are a protagonist short,

In this idyllic,

Well-produced scene?



Florence:

He couldn't wait

To join you up here.

Maybe he walked--

Cable cars scare him.



Anatoly:

Never mind him,

I haven't missed him so far.



Both:

Maybe it won't do any harm

To struggle on without his charm.

Funny how all at once I feel

That he can go jump off the mountain--

I won't care!



Florence:

This is the one situation

I wanted most to avoid.



Anatoly:

My dear opponent--

I really can't imagine why.



Florence:

So I am not dangerous then?

What a shame.



Anatoly:

No, you're not dangerous.^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^Florence:

Who could think that of you?^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^You--



Both:

You are so strange.

Why can't you be

What you want to be?

You should be scheming,

Intriguing,

Too clever by half!



Anatoly:

I have to hand it to you

For you've managed

To make me forget

Why I ever agreed on this farce.                   Florence:

I don't know why                                         Know why



Both:

I can't think of anything

I would rather do

Than be wasting my time

On mountains with you.



Frederick:

Who'd ever think it?

Such a very pretty setting.

Tell me what's the betting,

Very pretty plotting, too.

No matter--

I've done all your work for you.



Florence: [Spoken]

Freddie.



Frederick:

Who'd ever guess it?

Daughter in collaboration

With the very nation

Gave her father third degree.

Where's Daddy, dead,

Or in the KGB?



[Spoken]

While my second has been curling up with my

opponent, I have agreed to new terms with

Global Television, which in short means more money--

for you as well, but that can't be helped. Therefore,

this meeting is unnecessary. The match can continue

and we don't have to be friends.
