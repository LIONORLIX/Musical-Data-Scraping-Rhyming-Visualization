Molokov And Anatoly


Molokov: [Spoken]

The man is utterly mad. Believe me, Anatoly, you're

playing a lunatic.



Anatoly: [Spoken]

That's the problem. He's a brilliant lunatic, and you can't

tell which way he'll jump. Like his game, he's impossible

to analyze. You can't predict him, dissect him, which of

course means he's not a lunatic at all.



Molokov:

What we've just seen's

A pathetic display

From a man who's

Beginning to crack.

He's afraid--

He knows he isn't

The player he was,

And he won't get it back.



Anatoly:

Nonsense!

Why do you people

Always want to believe

Third-rate propaganda?



Molokov:

My friend, please relax,

We're all on your side.

You know how you need us.



Anatoly:

I don't need my army

Of so-called advisors,

And helpers

To tell me the man

Who's revitalized chess

single-handed

Is more or less out of his brain,

When it's very clear

He's sane.



Molokov:

Listen, we don't

Underestimate Trumper.

We won't get caught

In that trap.

After all, winning or losing

reflects on us all.



Anatoly:

Oh, don't give me that crap.

I win, no one else does,

And I take the rap if I lose.



Molokov:

It's not quite that simple--

The whole world's tuned in,

We're all on display.

We're not merely sportsmen.



Anatoly:

Oh, please don't start

Spouting that old party line.

Yes, I know it's you job,

But just get out and get me

My chess-playing second.

In 36 hours we begin--

That is if you want to win!



Molokov: [Spoken]

Wanting is not sufficient. We have to know. We have

to make sure. All men have a weakness. His is that

woman. Take her, and you win the game.



Anatoly: [Spoken]

So you think I can't win otherwise?



Molokov: [Spoken]

I'm not saying that. I'm just making certain. And she

is attractive. Then there's her intriguing family history--

Hungary, 1956 and all that.



Anatoly: [Spoken]

I'm a chess player, Mr. Molokov. You go and play

these other games.
