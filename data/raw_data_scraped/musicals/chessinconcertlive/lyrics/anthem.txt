Anthem


Anatoly:

No man, no madness--

Though their sad

Power may prevail--

Can possess, conquer,

My country's heart.

They rise to fail.

She is eternal--

Long before

Nations' lines were drawn.

When no flags flew,

When no armies stood--

My land was born.



And you ask me

Why I love her

Through wars,

Death and despair--

She is the constant,

We who don't care.

And you wonder

Will I leave her--

But how?

I cross over borders,

But I'm still there now.



How could I leave her?

Where would I start?

Let man's petty nations

Tear themselves apart.

My land's only borders

Lie around my heart.
