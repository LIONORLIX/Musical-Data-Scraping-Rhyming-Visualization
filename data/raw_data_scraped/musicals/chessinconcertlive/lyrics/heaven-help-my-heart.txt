Heaven Help My Heart


If it were love

I would give that love

Every second I had,

And I do.

Did I know where

He'd lead me to?

Did I plan doing all of this

For the love of a man?

Well I let it happen anyhow,

And what I'm feeling now

Has no easy explanation--

Reason plays no part.

Heaven help my heart.



I love him too much,

What if he saw

My whole existence

Turning around a word,

A smile, a touch.



One of these days,

And it wont be long,

He'll know more about me

Than he should.

All my dreams will be understood,

No surprise,

Nothing more to learn

From the look in my eyes.



Don't you know that

Time is not my friend?

I'll fight it to the end

Hoping to keep that

Best of moments

When the passion start.

Heaven help my heart.



The day that I find,

Suddenly I've run

Out of secrets,

Suddenly I'm not

Always on his mind.



Maybe it's best

To love a stranger--

Well, that's what I've done.

Heaven help my heart.

Heaven help my heart.
