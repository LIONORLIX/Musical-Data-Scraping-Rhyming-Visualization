I Know Him So Well


Florence:

Nothing is so good

It lasts eternally.

Perfect situations

Must go wrong,

But this has never yet

Prevented me

Wanting far too much

For far too long.



Looking back, I could

Have played it differently--

Won a few more moments,

Who can tell?

But it took time

To understand the man.

Now at least I know

I know him well.



Wasn't it good?                          Svetlana:

Oh, so good

Wasn't he fine?

Oh, so fine.

Isn't it madness?



Both:

He can't be mine?



Florence:

But in the end he needs

A little bit more than me--

More security.



Svetlana:

He needs his fantasy

And freedom.



Florence:

I know him so well.



Svetlana:

No one in your life

Is with you constantly.

No one is completely

On your side,

And though I move

My world to be with him,

Still the gap between us

Is too wide.

Florence:

Looking back, I could                           Looking back, I could

Have played it differently                       Have played it some other way.

Learned a little

More before I fell                                  I was just a little careless,

But I was ever                                     Maybe.

So much younger then                         I was so much younger then.

Now at least

I know I know him well                          I know I know him well.



Wasn't it good?

Oh, so good.

Wasn't he fine?

Oh, so fine.

Isn't it madness?



Both:

He won't be mine?

Didn't I know

How it would go?

If I knew from the start,

Why am I falling apart?



Svetlana:

Wasn't it good?

Wasn't he fine?



Florence:

Isn't it madness?



Both:

He won't be mine?



Florence:

But in the end he needs

A little bit more than me--

More security.



Svetlana:

He needs his fantasy,

And freedom.



Florence:

I know him so well.



Svetlana:

It took time

To understand him.



Both:

I know him so well.
