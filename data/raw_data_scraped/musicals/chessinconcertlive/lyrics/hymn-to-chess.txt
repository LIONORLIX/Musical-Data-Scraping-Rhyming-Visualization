Hymn To Chess


The Arbiter: [Spoken]

And now let us dedicate ourselves to the spirit

of chess.



Chorus:

We are one united family,

Black and white.

The game--

Our one true guiding light,

Sweeping through

The darkest corners

To express

Countries, classes,

Creeds as one,

In love of chess.
