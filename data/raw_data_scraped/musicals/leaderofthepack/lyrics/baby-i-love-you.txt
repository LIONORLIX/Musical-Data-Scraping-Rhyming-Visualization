Baby I Love You


(Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh)



Have I ever told you how good it feels to hold you

It isn't easy to explain

And though I really keep trying, I think I may start crying

My heart can't wait another day

When you kiss me I've just got to say



(Baby I love you) C'mon baby

(Baby I love you) Ooh-ee baby

(Baby I love you) Baby I love only you

(Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh)



I can't live without you, I love everything about you

I can't help it if I feel this way

Oh I'm so glad I found you, I want my arms around you

I love to hear you call my name

Oh tell me that you feel the same



(Baby I love you) C'mon baby

(Baby I love you) Ooh-ee baby

(Baby I love you) Baby I love only you

(Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh)



(brief instrumental interlude)



C.mon baby (Baby I love you)

C.mon baby (Baby I love you)

Sweet baby (Baby I love you)



FADE

C.mon baby (Baby I love you)

Ooh-ee baby (Baby I love you)

Oh, oh oh
