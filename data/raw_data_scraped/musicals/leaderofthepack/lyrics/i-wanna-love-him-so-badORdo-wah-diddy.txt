I Wanna Love Him So Bad/Do Wah Diddy


I Wanna Love Him So Bad



Down down down down be doo be doo

Down down down down be doo be doo



He lives in my neighborhood

When he walks by, he looks so good

Wanna get to know him (oh yeah)

Wish that I could show him (I care)



CHORUS:

I wanna love him so bad

You know it_s drivin_ me mad

_Cause when I look in his eyes

I can see it, paradise

So I can_t help it

I wanna love him so bad (love him so bad)



I know his name, his name is Jim

I can_t be blamed for lovin_ him

I could make him happy (oh yeah)

If he_d only let me (oh yeah)

Do Wah Diddy

There she was just a-walkin' down the street, singin' "Do wah diddy diddy dum diddy do"

Snappin' her fingers and shufflin' her feet, singin' "Do wah diddy diddy dum diddy do"

She looked good (looked good), she looked fine (looked fine)

She looked good, she looked fine and I nearly lost my mind



Before I knew it she was walkin' next to me, singin' "Do wah diddy diddy dum diddy do"

Holdin' my hand just as natural as can be, singin' "Do wah diddy diddy dum diddy do"

We walked on (walked on) to my door (my door)

We walked on to my door, then we kissed a little more



Whoa-oh, I knew we was falling in love

Yes I did, and so I told her all the things I'd been dreamin' of



Now we're together nearly every single day, singin' "Do wah diddy diddy dum diddy do"

A-we're so happy and that's how we're gonna stay, singin' "Do wah diddy diddy dum diddy do"

Well I'm hers (I'm hers), she's mine (she's mine)

I'm hers, she's mine, wedding bells are gonna chime



Whoa-oh, I knew we was falling in love

Yes I did, and so I told her all the things I'd been dreamin' of



Now we're together nearly every single day, singin' "Do wah diddy diddy dum diddy do"

A-we're so happy and that's how we're gonna stay, singin' "Do wah diddy diddy dum diddy do"

Well I'm hers (I'm hers), she's mine (she's mine)

I'm hers, she's mine, wedding bells are gonna chime



Whoa-oh-oh-oh, oh yeah

Do wah diddy diddy dum diddy do, we'll sing it

Do wah diddy diddy dum diddy do, oh yeah, oh, oh yeah

Do wah diddy diddy dum diddy do
