Why Do Lovers Break Each Other's Hearts


(oom-oppa-toom, oppa-toom, oppa-toom, oppa-toom, oppa-toom, oppa-toom,

oppa-toom)

(oppa-toom, oppa-toom, oppa-toom, oppa-toom oppa-toom, oppa-toom, oppa-

toom, oppa-toom



Why do lovers break each other's heart?

Oh, tell me why do lovers have to drift apart?

When me met the world was right

Now I'm cryin' every night

Why do lovers break each other's heart?



(shoo-dooby-doop, shoo-dooby-dooby-doo-wah)



Why do lovers break each other's heart?

Oh, tell me why can't lovers finish what they start?

A year ago we were one

Now just look at what we've done

Why do lovers break each other's heart?



Tell me, tell me I don't understand

Why we always hurt the ones we love

Tell, me, tell me where's the life we planned?

Where are the dreams that we were dreaming o-o-of?



Why do lovers break each other's heart?

Oh, tell me why do lovers have to drift apart?

When me met the world was right

Now I'm cryin' every night

Why do lovers break each other's heart?



(shoo-dooby-doop, shoo-dooby-doop)

(shooby-dooby-dooby-doo-wah)



When me met the world was right

Now I'm cryin' every night

Why do lovers break each other's heart?



(Why do lovers break each other's heart?) oh, tell me why

(Why do lovers break each other's heart?) oh, tell me, tell me why, why, why, why
