What a Guy


I see him everyday

He pass my way

What can I do?

Oh oh what a guy oh oh what a guy

What a guy he's sweet and gentle

What a guy he's sentimental

What a guy



Oh oh here he comes again

His smile is?

Should I smile too

Oh oh what a guy oh oh what a guy

What a guy his hair is wavy

What a guy he drives me crazy

What a guy

I want to tell him (that I love him)

Yeah that I really really I love him oh yeah

Tell him that I really care

Give him all my love to share

Want him so much I could die.

Yeah, yeah, yeah what a guy

Oh oh what a guy

What a guy he's sweet and gentle

What a guy he's sentimental

What a guy
