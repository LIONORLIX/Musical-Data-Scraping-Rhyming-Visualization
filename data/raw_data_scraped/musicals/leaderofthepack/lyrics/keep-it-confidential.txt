Keep It Confidential


If a man can love a liar

And a woman can love a thief

There’s a few things baby

You should know about me



I’ve always looked for power

In all the lovers I knew

But now I know the glory

Of simply loving you



You see, I don’t play your charades

(I don’t want your charades)

Ooh it’s time to stop the masquerade

(Time to stop the masquerade)

Why don’t you strip me bare, feel the truth

That’s all I’ve got to give to you



Why take these secrets,

Oh but keep them confidential

(Strictly confidential, keep ‘em confidential, strictly confidential)

Keep ‘em strictly confidential



[Loving you baby is on my mind

Keep 'em.]…cont.



I would call you lover

But you used that name before

Livin’ under coverr always keeping score

But there’s a few things ’bout ya baby

That’s breaking this chain of lies

(No one else could make me)

No one else could make me

Open up my eyes



You see, I won’t play your charades

(I won’t play your charades)

Oh it’s time to stop the masquerade

(Time to stop the masquerade)

Why don’t you strip me bare,

(Feel it)

Feel the truth

(Feel it)

That’s all I’ve got to give to you



Why don’t you take these secrets,

Oh but keep them confidential

(Strictly confidential, keep ‘em confidential, strictly confidential)

Keep ‘em strictly confidential

Strictly confidential

Keep ‘em confidential

Strictly confidential

Keep ‘em strictly confidential



Keep ‘em…..cont.



Loving you baby is on my mind

(Keep ‘em) …cont.
