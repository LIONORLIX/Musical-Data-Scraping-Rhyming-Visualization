Kick Your Ass


Toxie:

All my life, I’ve been a pacifist

But right now, you really got me pissed

That stuff didn’t kill me, I don’t know why

There’s a new Melvin in town

And it’s time for him to get on down

It’s gonna hurt like hell, and you’re gonna die

Maybe you better scram or I’ll cut you up like a holiday ham



I’m gonna kick, kick, kick, kick, kick your ass

I’m gonna kick, kick, kick, kick, kick your ass

I’m gonna kick, kick, kick, kick, kick your ass

It’s gonna be a blast to kick your ass



Though I can’t try to do me some harm

I can try just to rip off your arm

Nothing personal, I hope you understand

Now, I don’t mean to be mean

But I’m about to remove your spleen

Got a problem with that, than talk to the hand

You better pray to Billy Pram cause I’m gonna show you who I am



I’m gonna kick, kick, kick, kick, kick your ass

Rip, rip, rip, rip off your arms

Have, have, have, have me a blast

Oh man, oh man, hot damn

That was a monster jam

And that’s who I am

And I kicked your ass
