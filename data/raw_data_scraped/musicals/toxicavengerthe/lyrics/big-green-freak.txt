Big Green Freak


Old Lady:

I was walking from a pub

When this thug hit me with a club

I screamed but he wouldn’t stop

And I didn’t see one damn cop

The only one that heard me shriek

Was a big green freak

Big, big green freak



Doctor:

I’ve done every test that exists

I’ve called every last office

And there is only one thing that I know

He is covered by  yardage and mole

And my diagnosis is unique

You’re a big green freak

Big, big green freak



Mayor:

Tromaville’s in trouble

There’s a monster in town

Welcome to New Jersey

We’ll nail your balls to the ground

Your monstering of terror will come to an end

Your death will be announced on the news at ten

And I’ll be interviewed on CNN

Yes, CNN



Professor:

Well, the good news is that you’re not dead

The bad news, that’s one ugly head



Toxie:

Is there anything you can do’



Professor:

Scientifically speaking, you’re screwed

Hey, at least you’ve got a real nice physique

For a big green freak



All:

Big, big green freak



Toxie:

So, this is how I’ll be for all time

A freak of nature oozing slime

I guess there’s just one thing to do

Find polluters and rip them in two

I’m no longer small and weak

I’m Melvin Ferd the third

I’m Melvin Ferd the third

The big green freak

The big green freak
