You Tore My Heart Out


You tore my heart out

My human heart out

You ripped it from the bone

You left a hole there

A burning hole there

An ache I've never known



I've torn some arms off

I've torn some heads off

I've behaved quite violently

But that despair now

Cannot compare now

To what you've done to me

You, you tore my heart out



I thought you could see

The simple person in me

I thought you saw the truth within

It's me against the world

And it looks like the world is gonna win



And so I end here

As I began here

A soul whose hard to love

It's kind of funny

But for a moment

I was the man you dreamed of



Now that dream has died

So how can I stay?

I guess I'll have to save the world some other day

I wish you well now

I understand now

You did what you had to



But you tore my heart out

My human heart out

And that's the worst thing you could do

That's the worst thing you could do
