Who Will Save New Jersey?


White Dude:

There’s a place between heaven and hell



Black Dude:

Don’t need a map, just follow the smell



White Dude:

A place filled with filthy air



Black Dude:

A place full of dark despair



Both:

A place you have no prayer



White Dude:

A place called New Jersey



Black Dude:

New Jersey



Both:

Jersey, the Garden State



Black Dude:

There’s an exit called the thirteen gee



White Dude:

Right off the turnpike where it smells just like pee



Black Dude:

An exit no one dares get off



White Dude:

An exit where the children cough



Both:

An exit called Tromaville

Tromaville

If the pollution doesn’t get you, the aroma will



Sister:

Who will save New Jersey?

We’re dying for some air

There’s no hope in New Jersey, Lord

Does anybody care?



Three:

Lord, does anybody care’



White Dude:

The story we’re about to tell you is so disturbing,

we’ve stationed a registered nurse outside in the lobby.



Sister:

She is armed with a tranquilizer dart gun for those needing sedation.



Black Dude:

She also has Xanax and Vicatin she got off the internet.



White Dude:

And please, for the love of God, do not turn off your cell phones.



Black Dude:

Mm-mm, nah. You’re probably gonna wanna call your mama.



Three:

There’s no hope in New Jersey

We’re hanging by a thread



White Dude:

We’re choking in New Jersey



Three:

We might as well be dead



Sister:

Lord, we need a favor

We need a savvy savior



Three:

But who

Who

Who

Who



Melvin:

I will save New Jersey

I’m Melvin Ferd the Third



Sister:

Not him, Lord!



Melvin:

I’m here for you, New Jersey

On that you have my word

There must be a solution

To end this damn pollution

It’s time to start a global revolution

Sister, look at what has infested our town!



Sister:

What is that wretchedness?



Melvin:

It’s waste, toxic waste!

The worst problem we ever faced

It’s sick, God, its sick

Look what it did to my measuring stick!



Sister:

But where did it come from?



Melvin:

Look there. Across the Hudson River, what do you see?



Sister:

Manhattan.



Melvin:

The beautiful, conceited people of Manhattan.

Happy to use New Jersey as their toxic dumping ground!



Melvin & Sister:

Now, listen up Manhattan

We know, you’re stinking rich



Sister:

Your bed sheets may be satin

But Jersey’s not your bitch



Melvin & Sister:

Jersey’s not your bitch!



Sister:

Bless you, my son.



Melvin:

And don’t worry, Sister. Nothing can stop me! Oh, no. The town bullies!



Sarah:

God, I love New Jersey

It’s such a state of mind

Why do I love Jersey’

Probably cause I’m blind



Melvin:

Hey, Sarah. It’s Melvin.



Sarah:

Melvin, did those bullies beat you up again?



Melvin:

Yeah.



Sarah:

Well, it takes a brave man not to fight back.

By the way, have you noticed a new smell in town?



Melvin:

It’s giant vats of toxic, nuclear waste!

But don’t worry

I swear I’ll save New Jersey

But how, I do not know

We need new air in Jersey

And cleaner H2O



All:

In Tromaville

Tromaville

If the pollution doesn’t get you, the aroma will



White Dude:

So, there you have it. There will be no intermission tonight. This show is eight hours long.



All:

Help us win, New Jersey



Sister:

Help!



All:

Save us from this goo



Black Dude:

Crap, I just got scurvy



All:

Good God, what can we do?

Damn it, we’re New Jersey

We’re drowning in the mud



Sister:

Say your prayer for Jersey



All:

Or else we’re good and fucked

Good God, we’re good and fucked

New Jersey

New Jersey

Jersey

The garden state
