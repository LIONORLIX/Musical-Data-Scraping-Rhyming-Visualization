A feisty femme fatale

I’ll be living on a prayer



Black & White Dude:

She’ll be living, living on a prayer



Mayor:

So watch me as I campaign

Through snow and sleet and acid rain

Feel the love in this Jersey air



Black & White Dude:

Feel the love, feel the love in the air

She’s just a Jersey dame

Everybody’s high school flame

She was born to run this state



Mayor:

I was born, I was born to run



Black & White Dude:

She’s got a lot of love in her

There’s an angel from above in her



Mayor:

Cause someday, I’m gonna be the governor
