The Legend of the Toxic Avenger


Folk Singer:

Let me tell you a story about a man with a strange complexion

He killed a lot of folks and made a love connection

By day, he had a girl who baked him homemade breads

By night, he roamed the streets and ripped off people’s heads



This is the legend

He’s the legend

The legend of the Toxic Avenger



At first, the folks were sure he’d kill them all one day



Man:

He’ll kill us all!



Folk Singer:

But then, the crowd went down and the freak seemed okay



Man:

I like him now.



Folk Singer:

Last fall, his girlfriend wept, she couldn’t touch his face

Cause he’s out fighting crime and saving the human race



Yeah, this is the legend

He’s the legend

The legend of the Toxic Avenger

Yeah, yeah



He cleaned up Tromaville by clogging up the vats

He won the children’s love by saving all their cats



Kid:

I love you, Toxie!



Folk Singer:

Toxie’s a hero now, he’s bigger than superman

Let him lay some woopass on

Let him lay some woopass on

The man could really lay some woopass on

All the town’s bad



And so the cops got scared, some soiled their britches

The rest just ran away like freaked out little bitches

Now the mayor stands alone, it’s her against the goon

She knows the time has come, it’s gonna be high noon



Oh, he’s the legend



Toxie:

I’m the legend



Both:

The legend of the Toxic Avenger



Folk Singer:

There goes the legend

Yeah, the legend

Whoa, he’s the legend

Hot damn, the legend

Gotta tell your children about the legend

Tell your children’s children

And your children’s children

And your children’s tell their friends

And then their friends will friends

Make some calls, better write some letters

Na, na, na, na, na, na, na



Mayor:

Shut up!



Folk Singer:

The legend of the Toxic Avenger!
