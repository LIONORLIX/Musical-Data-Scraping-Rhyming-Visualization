Opposite Attraction


Female: Come on boys

I say everyone needs love and true love in return

but you say you've got to change the world

well that's all right

cause I say no one lives by bread by bread alone

but you say people got to have a home that's what you say but

I say opposite attraction like magnetism or the pieces of a puzzle its a natural reaction

now baby its sick now I think im having trouble now we're different as we can be

im the fittest pretty girl in seas we are so tiny boy to make you scream

but that's why opposites attract for real yeah opposites attract for real



Male: now you know me I gotta speak

my mind no matter what the cost and you say



Female: oh don't you leave me behind



Male: that's what you say and you say



Female: you say that love is all its all we need



Male: and I say ooh girl we livin in a world a world so real



Both: now opposite attraction



Male: though we keep trying



Both: theres an awful lot of distance an emotional reaction



Male: now im taking my shot cause

I need to make a difference now we're different as

we can be and politics puts you to sleep now

im just there to pay your fee now is that the way

this has to end baby can we still be friends

and I know some day you will understand
