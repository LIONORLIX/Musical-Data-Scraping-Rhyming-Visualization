God Draws Straight


As I left my house

As I walked out today

Thought I walked out' my marriage

Thought I walked out on grace



As the dawn it was breaking

At the end of the street

I didn't know what would happen

Didn't know what I'd see



I saw two transit buses

Block the road on our side

Saw a couple of joggers

Who chanced to run by



Saw some soldiers come out

And they mixed with the crowd

Tears came to my eyes

We're just walking around



Well there's so many people

Everybody is here

I saw the girls from the office

I saw those guys from the street



You might think you are lost

But then you will find

That god draws straight

But with crooked lines



I saw a matron in white

Her face lifted to heaven

I saw nuns on their knees

Some who were weeping



Saw a middle-aged man

And a government clerk

An Afro-mestizo

Held his rosary up



I saw nobody leave

I didn't feel fear or terror

It felt like a movie

Like the end of an era



Nobody got hurt

And nobody died

I'll remember this day

I'll remember this time



And there's so many people

Everybody is here

I saw the girls from the office

I saw those guys from the street



You might think you are lost

But then you will find

That god draws straight

But with crooked lines



As I turned on my walkman

And all I could hear

Every station was Marcos

He's on every TV



An appliance store window

He fills every screen

Then the TVs went blank

And his face disappeared



Then the darkness it thickened

There was no time for choices

Half blind I ran

I was guided by voices



When the choppers took off

Leaving Malaca√±ang

We knew it was over

Knew it was the end



And there's so many people

Everybody is here

I saw the girls from the office

The whole country, it seems



You might think you are lost

But then you will find

That god draws straight

But with crooked lines



Yeah god draws straight

But with crooked lines
