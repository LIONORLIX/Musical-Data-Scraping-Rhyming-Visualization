Men Will Do Anything


You play around with that woman

Didn’t you know I cared?

Walking ’round, ev’ryone can see

A sleazy cheap affair



What’s the matter with me baby?

Am I not good enough for you?

If you prefer that slut—okay

I’ll tell you what we’ll do



Men will do anything

For a little piece of mind

Men will do anything

That’s how you keep them in line

Men will do anything

For some sweet tranquility

Men—will do anything

And there’s nothing you can do to me



Do anything that you want them to

If you leave them on their own

They’ll sign here on the dotted line

If you ignore what they have done



Like a poor little mangy puppy

With his tail between his legs

If you catch them fooling around

Outside the mosquito net



Men will do anything

For a little piece of mind

Men will do anything

That’s how you keep them in line

Men will do anything

For some sweet tranquility

Men—they’ll do anything

And there’s nothing you can do to me
