Walk Like a Woman


(Imelda and answers)

He taught me (how to do it)

He taught me (lightly)

He taught me (you’ll get through it)

He taught me (nightly)



And to be married to such a man

I can’t believe how lucky I am

I am so lucky—so lucky to be

Never poor no more—I have all that I need



I’m going to learn how to walk like a woman

I’m going to learn how to dress, how to dance

I’m going to learn how to make an impression

Do anything for the love of this man



And if he loved me on the day we met

Then why must I be someone else?

The girl he married—now is that still me?

Who am I now? I ask myself



See him look at someone else

I copy her hair and the way that she dress

I live to see him look at me

That’s all I want, that’s all that I need



I’m going to learn how to walk like a woman

I’m going to learn how to dress, how to dance

I’m going to learn how to make an impression

Do anything for the love of this man



Shouldn’t he love me for the way I am?

And if he loves me, then why must I change?

Was that the reason that we fell in love?

Will he still love me if I’m not the same?



And if I bang my head on the wall for hours

Then I won’t feel the confusion no more

The New York doctor—bright yellow pills he gave me

Remind yourself what you’re doing it for—

It’s for love—it’s for love—it’s for love

It’s for love—it’s for love—it’s for love

It’s for love—

(in your head, there’s nothing wrong with your heart)



I’m going to learn how to walk like a woman

I’m going to learn how to dress, how to dance

I’m going to learn how to go out in public

Do anything for the love of my man



It’s for love—it’s for love—it’s for love

It’s for love—it’s for love—it’s for love

It’s for love—

(in your head, there’s nothing wrong with your heart)
