Dancing Together


Went to the house of Mary Lasker

Saw Matisses, Picassos, Renoirs and Gauguins

Golf course and flowers, statues and stables

I met a Whitney, Rockefeller and Brown!



And they were dancin’, dancing together

Dancin’, oh so beautifully

Dancin’, dancing together

Dancin’, oh as if in a dream



Charles Jourdan, Oleg Cassini

There was Andy Warhol and Hanae Mori

Beautiful products all over the table

Fills my heart up with thoughts of my people



And they were dancin’, dancing together...



I love my little people

You don’t know what it’s like

I’d rather be back in my Leyte

Back in the Quonset hut



Ali Hassan, Margot Fonteyn

Christina Onassis and the Queen of Spain

Beautiful women in beautiful homes

Just out of reach if your skin’s colored brown



And they’ll be dancin’, dancing together...



“Hello Mr. Zeibel?

Yes, my name is Jane Ryan—Mr. Saunders

and I would like to make a deposit…”



Mm-hmm, now listen:

Breakfast with George, disco with George

It must be us who truly serve!
