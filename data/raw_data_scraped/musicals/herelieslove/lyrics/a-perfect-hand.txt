A Perfect Hand


They occupied our country

We were almost overrun

I knew if I did not react

They’d kill us, ev’ryone



I promised to my mother

She meant so much to me



That for ev’ry single tear she shed

There’d be a victory



Who’s holding aces?

And who’s gonna fold and

Who’s got a secret?

And who’s feeling bold?

It’s a winning combination

If a lady understands…that the

King and the Queen of Hearts

Could be a perfect hand



So know what you are holding

But be prepared to bluff



There are many ways to win a game

And skill is not enough



In the Senate or in business

But most of all in love

You ladies all know how things work

You know how to get things done



And if you open the door for a lady

You open a door for yourself

And a stranger’s only someone

Who you have yet to help



Who’s holding aces?

And who’s gonna fold and

Who’s got a secret?

And who’s feeling bold?

It’s a winning combination

If a lady understands…that the



King and the Queen of Hearts

Could be a perfect hand
