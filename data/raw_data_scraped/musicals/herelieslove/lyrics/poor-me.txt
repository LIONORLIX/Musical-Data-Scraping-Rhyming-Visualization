Poor Me


MARCOS:

Oh Imelda

Light of my world

My queen of hearts

For all of these years

Come back to me

Don't leave me alone

For there is darkness

When you are not here



IMELDA:

Putang ina mo!

You deserve to be sick

In public no less

What you did to me

How can a titi mo

Run the country?

It takes a woman

To do a man's job



MARCOS:

I'll be up and about

In a matter of days

She, she meant

Nothing to me

I'll never do it again



ENSEMBLE:

The President's fine!

It's a slight allergy

Well he's doing okay

You know he's writing a book!

Our President's fine!

It's just a small cold

Now our President's fine

You know he's so overworked!



ENSEMBLE:

Poor me!



IMELDA:

Now I have to do everything!



ENSEMBLE:

Poor me



IMELDA:

I'm their star and their slave



ENSEMBLE:

Poor me



IMELDA:

I learned to walk like a woman



ENSEMBLE:

Now I'm strong



IMELDA:

Nothing can stand in my way



ENSEMBLE:

Our President's fine

How to do it

He's doing okay

Lightly

Our President's fine

You'll get through it

I saw him today

Nightly

Our President's fine



IMELDA:

Now I have to do everything



ENSEMBLE:

He's doing okay



IMELDA:

I'm their star and their slave



ENSEMBLE:

Our President's fine



IMELDA:

I learned to walk like a woman



ENSEMBLE:

I saw him today



IMELDA:

Nothing can stand in my way



MARCOS:

Oh Imelda

Light of my world



ENSEMBLE:

How to do it



MARCOS:

My queen of hearts



ENSEMBLE:

Poor me



MARCOS:

For all of these years



ENSEMBLE:

Lightly



IMELDA:

Let me be



MARCOS:

Come back to me



ENSEMBLE:

Poor me



MARCOS:

Don't leave me alone



ENSEMBLE:

You'll get through it



IMELDA:

Your star and slave



ENSEMBLE:

Now I'm strong

Nightly
