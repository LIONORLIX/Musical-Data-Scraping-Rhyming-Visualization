Eleven Days


He’s so fast, tell me what’s his name?

It was only a moment, but I don’t feel the same



He gave me—two roses

He gave me—two roses

One is open

One is closed

One is the future

And—one is my love—



Eleven days—since the moment we met

Eleven days—I will never forget

Eleven diamonds—on the ring that he gave

I haven’t seen him—in

Eleven days

Eleven days

Eleven days

Eleven days



What am I doin’?—must be out of my mind

He pulled out the paper and I signed on the line



He gave me—two roses

He gave me—two roses

One is open

One is closed

One is the future

And—one is my love—



Eleven days—since the moment we met

Eleven days—I will never forget

Eleven diamonds—on the ring that he gave

I haven’t seen him—in

Eleven days

Eleven days

Eleven days

Eleven days
