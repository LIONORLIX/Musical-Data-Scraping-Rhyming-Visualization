Just Ask Flowers


AURORA AQUINO:

When I asked my son

What do you want to be?

I was a little surprised

When he said to me



"I wanna' be a drummer, mom

I wanna' be a drummer

I gotta' call the people, mom

And get 'em all together



I wanna' be a drummer, mom

I wanna' be a drummer

I gotta' call the people, mom

And get 'em all together"



Now I watch the procession

As his body goes by

Half the country is here

But they won't see me cry



Ten thousand or more

And they've waited for hours

When I asked why are you here

They said, "Just ask the flowers"

They said, "Just ask the flowers"



Yeah just ask the flowers

Tama na, sobra na

We put up with so much

But this is going too far



"I wanna' be a drummer, mom

I wanna' be a drummer

I gotta' call the people, mom

And get 'em all together



I wanna' be a drummer, mom

I wanna' be a drummer

I gotta' call the people, mom

And get 'em all together"



It was a hero's procession

Now it's more than one man

And my son was a drummer

This I now understand



That day something was born

In those afternoon showers

And the reason they're here

You need just ask the flowers



Just ask the flowers

Yeah just ask the flowers

Tama na, sobra na

We put up with so much

But this is going too far



"I wanna' be a drummer, mom

I wanna' be a drummer

I gotta' call the people, mom

And get 'em all together



I wanna' be a drummer, mom

I wanna' be a drummer

I gotta' call the people, mom

And get 'em all together"
