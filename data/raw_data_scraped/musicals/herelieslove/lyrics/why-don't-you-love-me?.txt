Why Don't You Love Me?


Imelda:

Why don’t you love me?



Estrella:

Why don’t you love me?



Imelda & Estrella:

Why don’t you love me?



Imelda:

I gave you my life

I gave you my time

What more could I do?

I’m broken inside



Estrella:

I rose each morning

Worked way past midnight

Exhausted, expired

Now you kick me out?



Imelda & Estrella:

Why don’t you love me?

What’s a woman to do?

Why don’t you love me? (do I)

Mean so little to you?



Estrella:

It’s been—so long—our lives—

Imelda:

What’s wrong—what’s right?

Imelda & Estrella:

I did ev’rything…

Estrella:

Ev’rything was for you



Imelda & Estrella:

Why don’t you love me?



Estrella:

My legs won’t hold me

My chest feels so strange

Why don’t you love me

Was it something that I said?



Imelda:

How can you say this?

And when did you change?

You used to love me

Was it just pretend?



Imelda & Estrella:

Why don’t you love me?



Imelda:

Just look at Nixon

They tore him apart

How could you be so hard?

I gave you my heart



Estrella:

Does it add up to nothing

The years that we’ve been through



Imelda:

And how can you say this to me

Imelda & Estrella:

When I did ev’rything—

Imelda:

Ev’rything was for you



Imelda & Estrella:

Why don’t you love me?

Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why?
