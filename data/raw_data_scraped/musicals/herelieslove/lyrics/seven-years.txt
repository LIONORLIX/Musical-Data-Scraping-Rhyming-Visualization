Seven Years


Aquino:

For seven years I’ve been in here

Seven years down in the hole—they said

“Your watch, your glasses and your wedding ring

You won’t need them anymore”



I felt abandoned—I felt cast aside

So where is God who never sleeps?

I heard a voice say, “Why do you cry?”

Then I found my inner peace



Imelda:

Ninoy, you were my first love

But you said I was too tall

The heart gets stronger and grows colder

For the Rose of Tacloban

Aquino:

I begged to God could he forgive me now?

And take back all those things I said

This moment was a gift from above

Maybe it’s some kind of test



Imelda:

Santo Nino, Santo Nino

Take good care of him

Santo Nino, Santo Nino

Take good care of him



Ninoy, remember a long time ago

You used to walk me to my home?

Who set you free? Who built this hospital?

You think I hate you but you’re wrong



Aquino:

For seven years I wore this crucifix

A necklace that watched over me

Face to face with mortality

I let go of all my fears



Imelda:

Now my husband he might hate you

But you know I saved your life

Ninoy, don’t be a hero

I beg you, don’t get on that flight



Imelda:

Santo Nino, Santo Nino

Take good care of him

Santo Nino, Santo Nino

Take good care of him



Santo Nino, Santo Nino

Take good care of him

Santo Nino, Santo Nino

Take good care of him
