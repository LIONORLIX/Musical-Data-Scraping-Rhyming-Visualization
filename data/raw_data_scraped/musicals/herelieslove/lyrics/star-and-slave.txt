Star and Slave


IMELDA:

Last night, I had a dream

That I was back in Leyte

I dreamed I was barely alive

But I could still see



Then a woman in white

Approached my bed

This Egyptian queen

She could raise the dead



And a crowd of people

They were praying in there for me

And this crowd of people

They were singing their songs for me



And I can feel it now

Their faith and affection

Feel that I, I'm

Their Pygmalion now



I sit up in the dream I rise

And I, I come back

To the river of life

Now I rejoin the river of life



Now my personal life

That old life is over

And I'll serve my country

For the rest of my days



And I, oh I thank god

We know how to make money

Now I, I am the people's

Star, star and slave



Now it's because of you

That happiness lives here

And I'll give you my love

Now it's my turn to say



That if, if it is true

That you shall enslave me

Well it's because of you

Nothing can stand in my way



Let me be

Your star and slave

And my personal life

Well let them take it away



I can't be hurt anymore

By those things that they say

Let it come, let it come

Let it come what may



Let me be

Your star

Star and slave
