Don't You Agree?


With my heart and with my skin

From town to town and back again

With my skin and with my soul

How each one smiles when he’s alone



And here we are—convention center

Traveled so far—crossed many rivers

No time to rest—no time to sleep

Keep movin’ on—my tired feet



Sometimes we need a hero

Can’t make it on our own

Sometimes you need a strongman

When things are out of control



Don’t you agree? Agree with me

Don’t you agree? Don’t you agree?

Don’t you agree? Agree with me

Don’t you agree? Don’t you agree?



Who needs a chair? Whose roof has leaks?

Their children’s names, what each one needs

Got my people ev’rywhere

The bellboys and the operators



Now, who stood up to the Japanese?

Who cares about the Philippines?

He’ll build a house—I’ll decorate

I’m telling all you delegates



Don’t you agree? Agree with me

Don’t you agree? Don’t you agree?

Don’t you agree? Agree with me

Don’t you agree? Don’t you agree?



Sometimes we need a hero

Can’t make it on our own

Sometimes you need a strongman

When things are out of control
