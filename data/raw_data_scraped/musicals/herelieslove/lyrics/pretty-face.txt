Pretty Face


Will you reach—into your pockets?

And show us that you care

For the orphans, and the farmers

Ev’ryone give their share



I feel so guilty, when I’m resting

Though I rise at early dawn

For ev’ry hour that passes

I could have helped someone



And we’ll show the world

What a country girl can change

And we’ll show the whole wide world

That we have a pretty face



Pretty face, pretty face, pretty face have we

Pretty face, pretty face, pretty face have we



A thousand miles of concrete

Schools and dams and parks

Two thousand day care centers

And a center for the arts



There will always be poor people

Got to teach them how to care

If a hospital is needed

Ev’ry business give its share



And we’ll show the world

What a country girl can change

And we’ll show the whole wide world

That we have a pretty face



Pretty face, pretty face, pretty face have we

Pretty face, pretty face, pretty face have we



Some would call me Robin Hood

But this work we do I know is good

So dig a little deeper now

We’re gonna turn this thing around



Pretty face, pretty face, pretty face have we

Pretty face, pretty face, pretty face have we
