Here Lies Love (Finale)


When I was a young girl in Leyte

My dresses were all hand-me-downs and scraps

I’d see the people smile, when I would sing for them

How happy they all seemed—when I would dance



We lived a stone’s throw from the palace

A simple country girl who had a dream

The ladies passing by, a better class than I

How much it meant to me to be like these



Is it a sin to love too much?

Is it a sin to care?

I do it all for you

How can it be unfair?



I know that when my number’s up

When I am called by God above

Don’t have my name inscribed into the stone

Just say:

Here lies love…here lies love…here lies love—

Just say:

Here lies love…here lies love…here lies love—



The most important things are love and beauty

It doesn’t matter if you’re rich or poor

To prosper and to fly, a basic human right

The feeling in your heart that you’re secure



Is it a sin to love too much?

Is it a sin to care?

I do it all for you

How can it be unfair?

I know that when my number’s up

When I am called by God above

Don’t have my name inscribed into the stone

Just say:

Here lies love…here lies love…here lies love—

Just say:

Here lies love…here lies love…here lies love—
