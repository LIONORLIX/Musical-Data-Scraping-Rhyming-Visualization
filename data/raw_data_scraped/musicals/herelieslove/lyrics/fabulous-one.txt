Fabulous One


ENSEMBLE:

I'ma rise up!

I'ma rise up!

I'ma rise up!

I'ma rise up!



I'ma rise up!

I'ma rise up!

I'ma rise up!

I'ma rise up!



NINOY:

Out every night

In New York and Paris

Champagne and dancing

While back here at home

People barely surviving

They - they're living in shanties!

Our country's in trouble

But her party goes on



Now

Now I have risen

At the risk of her ire

And I have risen

At the risk of her scorn



Ha!

And I have risen

At the risk of her fury

While that monument rises

For the, the fabulous one

The fabulous one



You know who I'm talking about

The fabulous one

Out on her yacht

Bacchanalian feasts

On the palace roof

They party 'til dawn!

Now a cultural center

For Callas and Bernstein

That monument rises

For the fabulous one



Now

Now I have risen

At the risk of her ire

And I have risen

At the risk of her scorn



Ha!

And I have risen

At the risk of her fury

While that monument rises

For the, the fabulous one

She's so... fabulous, ha!



NINOY & ENSEMBLE:

A ghetto sprawls

And I am revolted

Houses of cardboard

No medical care

Misuse of money (I'ma rise up)

And a monument rises (I'ma rise up)

The stench of the toilets (I'ma rise up)

But they don't stand there (I'ma rise up)



NINOY:

C'mon, let me here ya' say

Rise up!

Say rise up!

Say rise up!

Say rise up!

Rise up!

Say rise up!

I wanna' see you jump!

Jump! Jump! Jump!

Jump! Jump! Jump!

C'mon let's jump! Jump!

Jump! Jump! Jump!



We're gonna' rise up!
