When She Passed By


I heard that you were getting married

I always knew that you’d do well

You’re a legendary beauty

From our small provincial town



Ilocos joined to Leyte

Two important families

A glorious occasion

A foretold destiny



I followed in the morning papers

How exciting it has been

The courtship and the whirlwind romance

For the sweetest of beauty queens



He’s crazy for you

Who wouldn’t be, I’m sure

And nothing matters more than that

And you’ll never be poor no more—



How she looked when she passed by

How she looked when she passed by

I feel like I’m watching history

Living before my eyes

Many years from now

We’ll recall just how

How she looked when she passed by



I know that you are in there somewhere

Letters get misplaced in the mail

Guess that there was some confusion

Amidst those throngs and swells



Did you see me outside?

Did you see me wave?

When you passed in your car

Ah well, that’s okay—



How she looked when she passed by

How she looked when she passed by

Feel like I’m watching history

Living before my eyes

Many years from now

We’ll recall just how

How she looked when she passed by
