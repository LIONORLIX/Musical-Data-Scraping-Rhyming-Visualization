American Troglodyte


I could be a dancer, maybe

I could be a judge

Used to sing that karaoke

But I, I don’t do it much



Democracy in action

There is nothin’ up my sleeve

A watermelon postcard I am

Plantin’ all my seeds



Americans are wearin’ those sexy jeans

Americans are usin’ technology

Americans are surfin’ that Internet

Americans are listenin’ to 50 Cent



Americans are buyin’ that modern art

Americans are drivin’ gigantic cars

Americans are doin’ that exercise

Americans are livin’ like troglodytes



Ev’rybody knows me

They are drinkin’ to my health

I terrorized my fam’ly and I

Terrorized myself



Evangelized my bedroom—you can

Ride away with me

All the girls together in a

Mighty symphony



Americans are playin’ that basketball

Americans are doin’ that rock and roll

Americans are goin’ to outer space

Americans are buyin’ that real estate



Americans are livin’ the simple life

Americans are dancin’ on Friday nights

Americans are goin’ to Broadway shows

Americans believe in the Holy Ghost



Americans are wearin’ that lingerie

Americans are throwin’ that shit away

Americans are watchin’ reality

Americans are goin’ from A to Z



Americans are dancin’ in discotheques

Americans are payin’ their income tax

Americans are workin’ from 9 to 5

Americans are livin’ like troglodytes
