Solano Avenue


What did I do to make you mad?

I swear I only told the truth

And none of this could hurt you now

And it’s no insult to be poor



So take back—all your money

Although I need it—more than you

Just acknowledge—that you knew me

On Solano Avenue—oohh



I didn’t mean you any harm

I didn’t mean to bring you shame

It’s not a sin that we had nothing

You and I were not to blame



When they teased you on the street

When they hurt you deep inside

To me it was—that you came running

And I held you when you cried



So take back—all your money

Although I need it—more than you

Just acknowledge—that you knew me

On Solano Avenue—oohh
