The Rape Of Miss Goldberg


Hi Miss Goldberg at your desk

My name?s Marvin

We?re alone at last

I turned 14 just today

And I thought

For a not unseemly price

You?d introduce me to the wonders of the bed

And also treat me nice



I?m the boy who throws the fits

He who puts the chalk inside his ear

Do you know me from a hole in the wall

Marvin?s cute though rarely good

But dearest please accept my hand

Miss Goldberg who

Is perfect womanhood



Why should Marvin jump on Miss Goldberg?

Why does Marvin dump on Miss Goldberg?

I knew when I first looked in his eyes

I like your eyes Miss Goldberg



Eyes

He has never seen my face

I have never seen your eyes

I was never out of place

I taught

That?s true she minded her business

She taught

I taught

And I minded my business

But the business at hand

Keep your hands off my eyes

But the business at hand

Is





I always liked the way you wore you glasses

In and out of classes

I always liked the way you got angry in your glasses

That?s cool Miss Goldberg

I always thought those glasses hid your passion

That?s Miss Goldberg?s fashion

I said

Now it?s my birthday and here?s my surprise

I?m gonna see your eyes Miss Goldberg

I?m gonna see your eyes my darling



Don?t touch my goddamn eyes

You little shit

I?ll throw a fit

I?ll beat your head in with a hammer

Ho ho ho ho





My eyes are my eyes

Your hands are your hands

Just keep your dirty fingers away from my face kid

That?s the only thing Miss Goldberg demands



Now move





Now move!



Listen I?m a bastard plumber with a penis

And I mean us two to be together

Teacher yes I do I do

I mean us two to screw together

Me together

You together



Miss Goldberg

What?

Miss Goldberg

What?

Make Marvin a happy boy!

Rub your hands between

Your hands between my knees!

La la la la

What does Marvin want from Miss Goldberg?

Miss Goldberg Miss Goldberg Miss Goldberg Miss Goldberg

Please x8





Marvin always gets the things he wants

Except the things he wants

He gets the things he wants

Marvin always gets the things he wants

Marvin always gets the things he wants

Except the things he wants



He gets the things

Except the things

He gets the things

Except the things

He



D?you want my telephone number?
