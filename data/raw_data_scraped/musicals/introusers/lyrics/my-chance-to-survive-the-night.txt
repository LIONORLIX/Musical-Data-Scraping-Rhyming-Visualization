My Chance To Survive The Night


(Girls)

Relax, relax, relax, relax,

(slowing down) Relax, relax, relax’



(Trina)

Relax, Marvin.



(Marvin)

Here’s my chance

To survive the night.

There’s nothing special about it.

If I try to go to sleep, I might.

But the phone will ring.



I had a girl.

She cut her lip on the sofa by the door.

The sofa was blue before.

That’s it for girls.

That’s it for girls.



Here’s my chance

To survive, to survive the night.



Here’s a dance

I might try to make.

I’m not so lucid about it,

But I’m sure of the path the arms must take.

And the feet don’t move.



I found a word.

It was a queer little thing with lots of regret.

I had a way with words, and yet.

I’m through with words.

That’s it for words.



Here’s my chance

To survive, to survive the night.

Here’s my chance

To survive, to survive the night.

To survive the day.

To survive my life.

In the most very natural,

Most unremarkable way.



I played a game.

She was as cute as a dime and couldn’t spell.

I asked her to spell my name.

That’s it for girls,

That’s it for girls,

That’s it for girls.



That’s it, that’s it, that’s it for girls.

That’s it, that’s it, that’s it for girls!



Here is my chance

To survive, to survive the night!

Here’s my chance

To survive, to survive the night!

Here’s my chance

To survive, survive, survive,

Survive,

To survive the night!
