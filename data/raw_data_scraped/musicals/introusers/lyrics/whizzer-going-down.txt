Whizzer Going Down


MARVIN

He hates my wife

I hate his food

He thinks I?m rude but nice

I think he?s nice but indiscreet

He thinks I?m sweet

But, he treats me kinda funny

I say Whizzer, Whizzer Brown

I see Whizzer going down



Oh Whizzer, Whizzer Brown

Isn?t it delightful playin? easy

Yes Whizzer, Whizzer Brown I care

I found your door

We sing out more and more and more and more and more now



He rubs my neck

I rub his thigh

He asked me why I sweat

I ask him why he bites his nails

And then he takes me in his arms

And he lights another cigarette

I say Whizzer, Whizzer Brown

I see Whizzer going down



Oh Whizzer, Whizzer Brown

Isn?t it delightful playin? easy

Yes Whizzer, Whizzer Brown I care

I found your door

We sing out more and more and more and more and more now



Go Whizzer

How ?bout Whizzer

Breathe deep Whizzer

Up and he?s going down



ALL

Go Whizzer

How ?bout Whizzer

Breathe deep Whizzer

Up and he?s going down



MARVIN

He?s on his knees

I?m lying flat

Just like a bad idea

He starts to blow

I start to fight

The room is yellow

And the bed is white

He?s going down

I think I?ll die away

He?s going down

I think I?ll die, die, die

I say



ALL

Whizzer



MARVIN

Oh Whizzer



ALL

Whizzer Brown



MARVIN

I see



ALL

Whizzer going down



ALL BUT MARVIN

Bah dah dah



ALL

Yah bah dadah dadah dah

Yah bad dadah dadah dadah

Yah badah dah dadah dah

Yah badah badah dah badah badah dah

Yah dah dah dah



(the next part is too confusing for me to transcribe)



MARVIN

He?s going down



ALL BUT MARVIN

He?s going down



MARVIN

He?s going down



ALL BUT MARVIN

He?s going down



MARVIN

He?s going down



ALL BUT MARVIN

He?s going down



MARVIN

Go Whizzer
