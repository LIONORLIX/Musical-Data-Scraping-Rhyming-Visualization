Marvin's Giddy Seizures


MARVIN

One, two

One, two, three

One, two, three, four



Marvin is a boy who has giddy seizures

He?s laughing all the time

Marvin is a boy who has giddy seizures

Sometimes they?re fatal

When he turns upside down like a ladle pouring soup

He?s a veritable fool

Marvin in my very best friend in school

It?s me? and Marvin



Lately I?ve been thinking maybe Marvin needs attention of a private sort

Maybe this whole seizure thing something he invented or is it medicinal

Should his mother be blamed?



ALL

Marvin has a something that most everybody needs

So that we cannot ever be embarrassed



MARVIN

Marvin is my very best friend in school

And I?m embarrassed and ashamed, oh!



MARVIN?S HIGH SCHOOL SWEETHEART

Marvin!



MISS GOLDBERG

Oh!



TRINA

What are you doing?



MARVIN

Pardon me boys and girls but I?m having a seizure



ALL BUT MARVIN

Oh, Marvin

Hey, Marvin



MARVIN

Yes I?m having a seizure today-hey-hey

Watch me laugh



ALL BUT MARVIN/ MARVIN

Oh?/ Arms disappear

MARVIN

Marvin holds his breath

His face is underwater

But that?s not a seizure



ALL BUT MARVIN

Woah?



MARVIN

Marvin talks of death

He imitates a slaughter

But that?s not a seizure



ALL BUT MARVIN

Oh?



MARVIN

When he begins to shriek like a person and his eyes turn an ordinary fizz

Nothing?s exactly like I say it is

But hey! That?s a seizure!



MARVIN?S HIGH SCHOOL SWEETHEART
