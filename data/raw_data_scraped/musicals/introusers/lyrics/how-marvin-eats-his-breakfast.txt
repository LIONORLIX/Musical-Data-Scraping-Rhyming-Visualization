How Marvin Eats His Breakfast


(Marvin)

I love being Marvin!

I love being Marvin!

Marvin always eats the finest breakfast in town!



(Girls)

How Marvin Eats His Breakfast.



(Marvin)

Everybody into the kitchen!

Here comes Marvin,

Banging his groin with his fist!



(Girls)

He mumbles in to insist:



(Marvin)

No one looks busy in this kitchen

And my breakfast isn?t ready

And my stomach aches!

I mean specifically the maid,

Who is reclining like she?s laid the golden egg!



I want some chatter and some gruel!

Make me wanna drool, try to make me hungry!



(Girls)

Oh!



(Marvin)

Cat got your tongue?



(Girls)

Marvin always knows the sort of answers he?ll allow!



(Marvin)

I may be sly, dear, but not young!



(Girls)

Wait until I?m older then I?ll kill you is his one unspoken vow!



(Marvin)

I need my breakfast. Now!



(All)

Everybody into the kitchen!

Here comes Marvin,



(Girls)

Aiming a gun at the maid;

He shoots her head; she falls dead!



(Marvin)

Oh Jesus Christ, it wasn?t loaded,

She?s an actor from the old school,

And a lousy chef!

I don?t want miracles from heaven,

Just some eggies over spinach over toast!



No! I will not apologize!

She should win a prize: "very best emoting"



(Girls)

Oh!



(Marvin)

That girl can?t cook!



(Girls)

Maybe she can?t cook, but have you seen her milk a cow?



(Marvin)

And I can read her like a book!



(Girls)

Marvin wouldn?t read that kind of novel anyhow!



(Marvin)

I need my breakfast now!



(Marvin and Girls)

People, people! (people, people!)

Stop your staring! (stop your staring!)

People, people, stop your staring, get to work my breakfast isn?t made yet! (People, people, stop your staring get to work my breakfast isn?t-)



(All)

Life is lonely, life is rotten,



(Marvin)

And thankfully short,

Thankfully short,

Thankfully short-



(Girls)

Like Marvin!



(All)

Everybody into the kitchen, here comes



(Marvin)

M-m-m-m-m- (like revving up a motorcycle or something)



(Marvin and Girls)

Marvin!



(Girls)

Waving his hands like a twit!

He throws a fit, then a knife!



(Marvin)

You call this breakfast on my birthday?

This is shit, this isn?t breakfast!

I could crack your feet!

I mean for God?s sake, am I talking to the wall?

When I say breakfast, I mean food!



I dreamt all night of hips and legs,

Now I want some eggs- things I might... relate to.



(Girls)

Oh!



(Marvin)

I?m just a sprite!



(Girls)

Marvin underestimates the fear that he?ll endow!



(Marvin)

I?ll wait here till you get it right!



(Girls)

Do I- Do I really- Do I really have to show you people how?



(All)

I need my breakfast.

Now!
