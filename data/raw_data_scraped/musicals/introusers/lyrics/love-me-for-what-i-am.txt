Love Me For What I Am


(Trina)

I met a man in a can.

Wouldn't you know he was going my way'

Talked till four, he talked more.

I was afraid I'd turn and say,



'Love me for what I am,

Not what I try to be.

Love me for what I am,

I am someone imperfectly me.'



(Miss Goldberg and Sweetheart)

The lights were low.

Oh, oh...



(Trina)

Don't you know

He gave a phony home address'

Then after weeks, guess who speaks.

'Darling', he says, and I say, 'Yes''



'Love me for what I am,

Not what I try to be.

Love me for what I am,

I am



A person who likes to lie too much,

I try too much

To impress other people.

Often my inferiors.'



(Miss Goldberg and Sweetheart)

Woah...



(Trina)

Could you like a girl like that'



(Miss Goldberg and Sweetheart)

Love, love, love, love.



(Trina)

Would you like a girl like that'



(Miss Goldberg and Sweetheart)

Love, love, love, love.



(Trina)

Would you hold her in your arms'



(Miss Goldberg and Sweetheart)

Love, love, love, love.



(Trina)

Could you like a girl like that'



(Miss Goldberg and Sweetheart)

Love, love, love, love.



(Trina)

Could you like a girl like that'



(Miss Goldberg and Sweetheart)

Love, love, love, love.



(Trina)

Could you like a girl like that'



(Miss Goldberg and Sweetheart)

Oh, oh, oh, oh'

Woah'

Oh, oh, oh, oh'



(Trina) (overlapping)

We lay in bed, he plays dead,

I play a game with sound and light.

Don't need a quiz, I'm all his.

'Darling', he says, 'We might survive the night-'



Love me for what I am,

Not what I try to be.

Love me for what I am,

I am someone imperfectly me.



(Miss Goldberg and Sweetheart)

A person who likes to lie too much,

I try too much.



(Trina)

Someone imperfectly me.
