How The Body Falls Apart/Your Lips And Me


ALL WOMEN

How the body falls apart

First the groin and then the heart

It?s easy

And it?s smart



Things on which we most depend

Seem to pale us in the end

How like, like a body

When the body fall apart



---



TRINA

The baby is crying on the swings

And the oldest is kicking ass

The parakeet hasn?t moved its wings yet

All good things come to past



I think of sunshine

And roses in bloom

But you?re off sitting

With another someone

In another room



That?s all right dear

You go on digging your grave dear

I didn?t know that you were lonely

I thought you?d agree

But when I saw your lips

I knew they didn?t belong to me



Your mother reports your father?s blue dear

And your father reports he?s fine

Your mother withheld her love from you dear

I try withholding mine



The neighbors love me

They tell me I?m great

But you?re off snoozing

With another floozy

In another state



That?s all right dear

You go on digging your grave dear

I didn?t know you?re so attractive

I thought you?d agree

But when I saw your lips

I knew they didn?t belong to me



Nice day

Nice life

Precious few people squawk

Nice



Good friends

High life

Isn?t it fun to talk?

Nice



The oldest drinks wine

The baby?s wailing

And the parakeet still can?t fly

Your mother reports your fathers failing

Two years failed to die



The neighbors love me

They say I?m a clown

It?s awful dressing in my blue carnation

When you?re outta town



Pay no mind dear

Just go on digging your grave dear

I didn?t ask to be your mother

Your lips were the key

But when I saw your lips

I knew they didn?t belong

No they didn?t belong

I?m sure they didn?t belong to me
