I'm Here


Celie

I don't need you to love me,

I don't need you to love.

I got . . .

I got . . .

I got my sister.

I can feel her now,

She may not be here, but she still mine.

I know she still love me.

Got my children.

I can't hold them now,

They may not be here, but they still mine.

I hope they know i still love them.

Got my house.

It still keep the cold out.

Got my chair

When my body can't hold out.

Got my hands

Doin' good like they s'pose to,

Showin' my heart

To the folks that i'm close to.

Got my eyes.

Though they don't see as far now,

They see more 'bout how things

Really are now . . .

I'm gonna take a deep breath.

Gonna hold my head up.

Gonna put my shoulders back,

And look you straight in the eye.

I'm gonna flirt with somebody

When they walk by.

I'm gonna sing out . . .

Sing out.

I believe i have inside of me

Everything that i need to live a bountiful life.

With all the love alive in me

I'll stand as tall as the tallest tree.

And i'm

Thankful for everyday that i'm given,

Both the easy and hard ones i'm livin'.

But most of all

I'm thankful for

Loving who i really am.

I'm beautiful.

Yes, i'm beautiful,

And i'm here.
