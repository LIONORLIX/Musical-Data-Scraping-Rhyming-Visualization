Somebody Gonna Love You


Celie:

Got nothin' to give you but a prayer.

God's gonna see you through.

To part with you more than I can bear

But somebody gonna love you.



Sweet baby, sweet,

This much I know is true.

Sleep baby, sleep.

'Cause somebody gonna love you.

Oh, I'm always gonna love you.
