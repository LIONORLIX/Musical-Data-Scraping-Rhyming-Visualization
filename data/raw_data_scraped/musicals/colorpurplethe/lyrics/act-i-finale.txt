Act I Finale


Shug

Now look here. I found a letter for you. From somebody in africa, goin' by the

Stamps.

Celie

It's from nettie!

Nettie appears in her white dress in celie's memory.

Nettie

Dear celie, i know you think i am dead. But i am not. I've been writing every week

All these years, but i guess you haven't gotten any of my letters because you haven't

Written back.

Celie

She's alive.

Nettie

You probably won't get this one either, 'cause i'm sure mister is still the only one to

Take mail out of the box, but if you do, one thing i want you to know, i love you, and

I am not dead.

Celie (clutching the letter to her heart)

Nettie's alive! She's alive!
