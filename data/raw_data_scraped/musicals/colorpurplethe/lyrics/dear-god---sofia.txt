Dear God - Sofia


Celie:



Dear God,

I love this woman!

My friend, sofia.

Harpo, he love her

And he smile ev'rytime he see her.

I ain't never seen such a vision!

Cow bossin' the bull around.

Ain't afraid o' nothin'

When she lay her law down.

Took harpo's hand,

Now she havin' his babies.

She rule the house an' its drivin' him crazy.

She give him lip and now he just fit to be tied.
