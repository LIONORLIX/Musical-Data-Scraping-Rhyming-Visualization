Sofia:

You told Harpo to beat me?!



Celie:

Im sorry.



Sofia:

I love Harpo. God knows I do. But Ill kill him dead, 'fo I let him or anybody beat me!



All my life I had to fight!

I had to fight my daddy!

I had to fight my brothers, my cousins, my uncles too!



But I never, never, never, never, never, never thought I'd have to fight

In my own house!



I feel sorry for you to tell you the truth.

You remind me of my momma!

Under yo' husband's thumb, naw

You under yo' husband's foot!

What he say go!

Why you so scared I'll never know.

But if a man raise his hand...Hell no!

Hell no!!



Girl child aint safe in a family of mens!

Sick and tired how a woman still live like a slave.

Oh, you better learn how to fight back

While you still alive!

You show them, girl, and beat back that jive!

Cause when a man jus dont give a damn...Hell no!

Hell no!!



Celie:

Sofia:

My sisters comin' to get me. I think I need a vacation on up and away from here.



Celie:

But Harpo yo' husband. You got to stay wit' him. I know you love 'em



Sofia:

When that man used to touch me

He'd climb on top and start to rock me away

Lord knows I still loves him

But he tried to make me mind

And I just aint that kind, hell no!



Celie:

Sometimes my husband get on me so hard, he hurt me all over.

But he my husband. So I jus' talk to my ol' maker.

This life'll soon be over. Heaven last always!



Sofia:
