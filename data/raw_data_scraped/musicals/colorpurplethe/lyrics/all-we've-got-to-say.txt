All We've Got To Say


Doris

That shug a hot mess - that's what she is!

Darlene

That's the truth, sister!

Doris

She got them heebies and jeebies

From moonshine and cheap wine,

And reefer and candy cane.

Darlene

Or is it the nasty relations

From earthly sensations

That put her in her pain?

Jarene

She a woman of low moral character

All church ladies

And that's all we got to say!
