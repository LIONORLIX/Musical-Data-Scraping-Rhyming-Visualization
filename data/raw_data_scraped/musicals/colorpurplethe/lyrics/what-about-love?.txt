Some money, you know.

Celie

Shug

In the morning. But i'll be back, too, in a month or so.

You'll see. Nobody ever love me like you.

Shug kisses celie on the lips.

Shug

Celie

Is that me who's floating away?

Lifted up to the clouds by a kiss,

Never felt nothin' like this.

Is that me i don't recognize?

Love's the one thing i knew all about,

I had it all figured out.
