Shug Avery:

Now there's somethin' 'bout good lovin' that all you ladies should know.

If you wanna light yo' man on fire, you gotta start it real slow.

Keep on turnin up the voltage til that man begin to glow

Like you switchin on a light bulb: Watch the juice begin to flow!



Now that I've got your attention

Here's what you men need to hear:

You want your lady racin' with you

You gotta get here in here!

Keep the key to let her know ya find the spot to rev her best

If you dont know where it is give her the stick!

She'll do the rest! Oh Ohh Ohh!



Push da button!

(Push da button!)

Push da button!

(Push da button!)

You gotta push it if you wanna come in!



Oh! Push da button!

(Push da button!)

Give me somethin'!

(Push da button!)

To let ya baby know it aint no sin!



Now if you wanna feel the train comin' yo' way!

Baby, push da button and pull the window shade!



Now listen all you red-hot lovers

You ought to know what to do!

(You oughta know what to do!)

There aint nothin' wrong with nothin'

That's right with both of you!

(That's right with both of you!)

So when tonight, you make ya lover cry out like a lion roar

Tell the neighbor your new kitten found the cream it'd been lookin' for!

Ohh oohh yeah!



Push da button!
