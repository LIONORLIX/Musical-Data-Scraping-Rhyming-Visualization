Mister's Song - Celie's Curse


Mister

Go on, git! Git outta my house! Leave me alone! Get out of . . . Get out! No! Leave

Me alone, you - no! Goddamn bats get out of my -! No! Stop! Get away from

Me! Ow! Help!!!!!

What you lookin' at? Bunch of damn fools. I don't have to stay here, worthless town.

I can walk right down this road. By myself. Never see nobody i know ever again.

Nobody to put up with.

Nobody to mess with me.

Nobody to push me around.

Nobody to tell me what to do.

Nobody to expect somethin' of me.

Nobody to tell me who i am

And who i ain't.

Nobody!

I got plenty to blame.

My daddy beat me,

For my own good, he say.

My first wife got kilt

When she run away.

My kids is all fools,

My crops is all dead,

Only woman i love

Won't lie in my bed.

A black man's life

Can't get any worse

'Less he wastin' away

Under miss celie's curse!

So tell me how a man do good

When all he know is bad?

Harpo happy.

What right he got to be happy?

Wife leave,

Girlfriend leave him, too.

His mama die in his arms.

Somebody tell me

How he keep findin'

So much good from so much bad?

His wife come back,

His business fine.

Everyone say

Harpo shine.

For all they been through,

They do just fine.

Nothin' i say

Change people mind about me.

Ain't gon' be nothin' i say,

Gon' be somethin' i do.

Maybe all my good lay ahead of me.

Ain't gon' be nothin' i say,

Gon' be somethin' i do.

Maybe everything i do.
