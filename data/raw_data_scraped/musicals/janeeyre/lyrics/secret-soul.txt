Secret Soul


JANE

What can I do now, my precious Lord?

His dark love would be my best reward

I know I should not dare to go

Deeper in his madness

But it's like a field I must run through

No one's words will make me love him less

How much can I stand, I dare not guess

The secret voice that speaks to me

Tells me he's in danger

Looking to the dust for tenderness

Deep in my secret soul

I stand alone

The purpose of why I'm here

Is still unknown

And I can't help but sense

The darkness in his mind

But I keep looking for his goodness

Afraid of what I'll find

My heart moves through his unquiet sea

I pray a wave will come and carry me

Closer to his troubled tide

Waters of his fury

But how can I swim this great divide?



JANE

Deep in my secret soulI cry his tearsI weather his angry voiceI feel his fears

His life has infected every wound

And every poreI feel his mystery possess me

And I pray that mercy's hand Will bless me Deep in his secret soul

His heart is cursedI summon my deepest will

To still his thirstGod give me the strength to go

Closer to where my heart is whole

Deep within his secret soul



ROCHESTER

Her spring of life

Draws me near

Her gentle voiceI hold dear

Her life has infected every wound

And every poreI feel her mystery possess me

And I pray that mercy's hand

Will bless me Deep in my secret soulI stand aloneI will not atone

And I will not ever let her

Deep within my secret soul
