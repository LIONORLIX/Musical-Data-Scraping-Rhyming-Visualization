Children of God


BROCKLEHURST

Form classes! Silence! Order!



SCHOOLGIRLS

We are the children of God

And we praise His word

We are blind in His love

In His love we will trust

For we are taught that we must



MISS SCATCHERD

Girls, don't slouch, keep in line

Or my nerves will snap

Do not whisper or breathe

Or I'll show you the strap



SCHOOLGIRLS

Oh, grateful we are for our daily bread

Oh, if only just once it could be instead

Sweet cakes and cottage pie

Food we could identify



BROCKLEHURST

I have a word to address to the students,

Here is a girl who is new to our school,

Her name is Jane Eyre,

and she is brought here by her excellent benefactress, Mrs. Reed



MRS. REED

I should wish her to be brought up in a manner suiting her prospects -

to be made useful - to be kept humble.

We must punish the flesh

She's prone to deceit

I would caution you not to be

Fooled by her lies



BROCKLEHURST

Deceit is a cardinal sin



MRS. REED

She knows not the danger she's in



BROCKLEHURST

These are the children of God

She will quickly learn

That a child deceitful Forever shall burn



MR. BROCKLEHURST

Disciplines are bornTo be humble and suffer

Punish the flesh to chasten the spirit

Purity comes from the pain of correction

The torment of martyrsIs holy and Christian

Starving the body will never extinguish the soul!



SCHOOLGIRLS

We are the children of God

And we praise His word

We are blind in His loveIn His love we must trust

For we are taught that we must

We are the children of God

But we find it queerIf we're really His childrenWhy isn't He here?



MRS. REED

Let this teach you!

Let this teach you! Wicked child!

Horrid wretched child! God despises you!



MISS SCATCHERD

She is depraved

The girl will be watched, sir

Every hourStand very still

All eyes will be watching

Watching a shameful child

Blind in his love

We're charity children

No mother or fatherJust heavenly care

God blesses our soulsAnd yet we despair
