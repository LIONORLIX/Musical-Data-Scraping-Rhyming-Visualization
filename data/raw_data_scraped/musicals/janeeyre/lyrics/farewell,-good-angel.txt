Farewell, Good Angel


ROCHESTER

Is this how you would leave me?

In ruin and despair?

My hope is quenched, my life is lost

Laid waste beyond repair

I was wrong when I deceived you

But there was no other way

Your character won't let you

Live the lie mine must obey!

And I don't mean to claim

That honour has been served

But why must I have eyes

To see you're not there?

Why must I take one more breath?

Let lightening strike

That's not the worst

Now that you've shattered my soul

I die accursed!

So farewell, good angel

Another day is done

I wrapped my life around you

And for a time, two fused as one

And God should strike me down

If you are truly gone

But why must I have eyes

To see you're not there?

Why must I take one more breath?

Let lightning strike

That's not the worst

I'd rather burn in Hell

Damning my soul to dwell

Lost in my pain

Than to live here on earth

Without my Jane!
