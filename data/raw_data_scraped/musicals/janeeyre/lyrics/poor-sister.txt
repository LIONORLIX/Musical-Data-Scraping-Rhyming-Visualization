Poor Sister


MASON

My dear, I have brought you a lily today

For the roses were frail

And the petals fell away

The morning mist has kissed your grave

Rest now in sleep

Our secrets will keep

Till we speak again tomorrow



JANE

Mr. Mason?



MASON

Miss Eyre! Jane

What happened here?



MASON

She set the flame

Although no one knows why

Poor sister

For she thought she could fly!

Sweet sister

Edward saved everyone else who was there

But got out too late for himself I declare

What happened to him

Well, it just isn't fair

Poor Edward



JANE

God have mercy...



MASON

He's still alive

But the dear man is blind



JANE

Dear master



MASON

And crippled in body

If not in his mind

Poor sister
