Forgiveness


HELEN

You mustn't be revengeful

You have to be strong

To offer good for evil

Return right for wrong

We must not hold a grudge

And we must learn to endure

Then as God is your judge

At least your heart will be pure

Forgiveness

Is the mightiest sword

Forgiveness of those you hate

Will be your highest reward

When they bruise you with words

When they make you feel small

When it's hardest to bear

You must do nothing at all

Forgiveness

Is the simplest vow

Forgiveness

Of all their crimes

Is your deliverance now

Bless those souls

Who would curse your name

When the last bell tolls

You'll be free of blame

You can continue to grieve

But know the Gospel is true

You must forgive those who lie

And bless them that curse you

Forgiveness

Is the mightiest sword

Forgiveness of those you hate

Will be your highest reward

The time will come when we will leave this world,

and then the injustice and the pain and the sin will fall away from us,

and only the spark of the spirit will remain - returning to God who created it

You must never lose faith

You must never lose heart

God will restore your trust

And I know you're afraid

I'm as scared as you are

But willing to be brave

Brave enough for love
