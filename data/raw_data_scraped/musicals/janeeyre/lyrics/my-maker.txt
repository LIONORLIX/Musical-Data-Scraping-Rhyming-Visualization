My Maker


JANE

I see my maker

And my mind's at rest

There will be no pain to feel

Only joy within my breast

I see his goodness

As he comes for me

Soon I'll be exalted

And my soul will be set free

But I will not be blessed

I have stumbled in the face of God

And when I come to rest

He'll know I have harmed

That which I love best

I see my maker

Peace has come so fast

I will be restored to him

We'll be joined at last
