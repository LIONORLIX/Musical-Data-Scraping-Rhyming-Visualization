Perfectly Nice


MRS. FAIRFAX

It'll be perfectly nice

Having someone with whom to converse

The servants are fine

But a little perverse

And if I'm a tiny bit terse

It's only because I just fired the chef

Are you talking to me?

I'm a little bit deaf

The weather's been rainy and gray

Robert, stop fussing, you're just in the way?

He's really a dear

Though a tiny bit queer

There was a time when winter was here

Milk?



JANE

No



MRS. FAIRFAX

No one came by

No one came near

Sugar?



JANE

No



MRS. FAIRFAX

I was alone, nearly a year

More?

And not a creature would come to the house

The vicar came once but he didn't stay long

Or did he come twice?

Maybe I'm wrong

Then, as the days went along

Like it or not, I was not as depressed

And soon after that

We were finally blessed

With little Adele, darling, come here

This is Miss Eyre

Your governess, dear.



ADELE

Bonjour, Miss Eyre.



JANE

Bonjour, Adele.



ADELE

Oh, vous parlez francais



JANE

She is French, then?



ADELE

Yes, I am French, but I speak English - frighteningly well!



JANE

You certainly do.



MRS. FAIRFAX

Run along now, Adele.



ADELE

Adieu mam'selle.



JANE

Au'voir, Adele...

What a spirited girl



MRS. FAIRFAX

What a story to tell!

Her mother is gone

Gone to the Lord

And Mr. Rochester took her in as his ward



JANE

Mr. Rochester? Who is he?



MRS. FAIRFAX

The owner of Thornfield! Did you not know he was called Rochester?



JANE

I thought Thornfield belonged to you!



MRS. FAIRFAX

Bless you, child, what an idea!

I'm in charge of the hall

When he's away I look after it all

And he's away most of the time



JANE

What sort of man is he like?



MRS. FAIRFAX

The kind of man who is never about.



JANE

Where does he go?



MRS. FAIRFAX

I wouldn't know...

One of a kind

Smart as a sage

And like good wine

Gets better with age

Modest and fair

Yet one wouldn't dare

Behave in a manner unfitting one's class

One has a place

That one mustn't surpass

This is our lot

Like it or not...

I think I've forgotten my thought

What was it? Ah! No, that wasn't it at all

Did I have a point?

I can barely recall

But you'll settle in

Read a few books

You've got the brains, if not quite the looks

You'll soon adjust

Everyone must

Heed my advice

Let's be precise

Listen to me, I will not tell you twice

You will be in good grace if you face

That a girl in your place

Will suffice...



MRS. FAIRFAX AND JANE

...if she's perfectly nice!
