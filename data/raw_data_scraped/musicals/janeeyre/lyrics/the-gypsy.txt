The Gypsy


ROCHESTER

I see a flame in the palm of your hand

Oh sister

You're peevish and puny and spoiled and bland

Oh sister

You have no principles

You have no taste

Your education was truly a waste

Don't be upset, girls, this has to be faced

Sweet sisters

I see a man in your future, my dear

Auspicious

But his claims of wealth and title I fear

Fictitious

You marry the scoundrel, and soon after that

You bear him a child and then you get fat

Lucky for you he leaves both of you flat

Dear lady

I see a journey you're planning to take

Oh sister

Believe me, my child, it's a fatal mistake

Oh sister

The road holds great danger

You'd better stay here

There's someone you long to be close to, my dear

He's not so far out of reach as you fear

Dear sister



JANE

And who might he be, mother?



ROCHESTER

I'm getting tired of this masquerade

Oh sister

Do you forgive me for this odd charade

Dear sister...
