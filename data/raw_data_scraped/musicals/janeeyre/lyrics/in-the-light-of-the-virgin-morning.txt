In the Light of the Virgin Morning


BLANCHE

In the light of the virgin morning

I look out through a misty haze

The estate has an ancient beauty

Mother must appraise

As I stroll through the pinks and roses

As I savour the columbine

I am grateful for all he is

And what will one day all be mine

The perfect plan

If only I could love the man

But I'm not quite sure I can



JANE

In the light of the virgin morning

In the shade of the chestnut tree

If I leave this unhappy bliss

Where will my Eden be?

For I'll miss this enchanted garden

Watching leaves as they turn to brown



BLANCHE

We will sell the estate, of course

And we will move to town



JANE

This is my fate

What more do I deserve?

I mustn't stay

What purpose would it serve?

He doesn't need me

His heart is blinded

Where will I go?

What star will light my way?

This is my home, oh God above I pray

The rock of ages will show me mercy

In the light of the virgin morning



BLANCHE

We'll be admired and praised

I'll know what happiness is

When I am his

I'll be the star in his night

And I will shine

As a bride

By his side



JANE

In the light of the virgin morning

I am cursed in my hope of heaven

For I know I will always love him



BLANCHE

In the light of the virgin morning

I am blessed in my hope of heaven

For I know I will come to love him
