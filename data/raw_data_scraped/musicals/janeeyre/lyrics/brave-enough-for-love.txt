Brave Enough for Love


JANE

Sir, I have come back to you

Content



ROCHESTER

Great God! What delusion is this?



JANE

Ready to stand here by your side,

As you see fit...



ROCHESTER

Is it Jane?



JANE

As your friend, or as your bride.



ROCHESTER

My living Jane!



JANE

Sir, you are my second self

And I will be your hands

I'll be your eyes

I am here

With my heart



ROCHESTER

I can't see, but I can feel...

How I've loved you, every day.



JANE

I've loved you stronger every day

How I've lived without your touch...



ROCHESTER

How I've struggled to survive...



BOTH

...Only God above can say.



ROCHESTER

Am I hideous, Jane?



JANE

Very, sir. You always were you know.



ROCHESTER

I see the wickedness is still within you.

But is it really you, Jane? Are you come back to me?



JANE

I am!



ROCHESTER

And you are not dead in some ditch, or an outcast among strangers?



JANE

No, sir! I am an independent woman now!



ROCHESTER

And independent woman?



JANE

My aunt has died and left me her fortune



ROCHESTER

Then you possess more wealth than I

What could I possibly offer?

I am no better

Than the old chestnut

Struck down by lightning

Its life cleft in two

For why should you marry

A blind man, a cripple

Tell me, Jane, what right do I have to you?

I prayed in the name of God

Don't let Jane suffer

Don't let her die

For three days, in my despair

I cried to heaven

Where is Jane Eyre?

Then, from my lips

Came a voice, came a name

I cried "Jane" from the depths

I called out

I cried "Jane"



ROCHESTER AND JANE

And I don't know what happened

But I thought I heard you...



JANE

Did you speak these words out loud?



ROCHESTER

I did. If anyone was listening,

he would have thought me mad...I called out with such frantic energy.



JANE

And this was last Monday evening, just after sunset?



ROCHESTER

Yes, but what followed is the strangest point.

Where the voice came from, I cannot tell,

but I know whose voice it was...And the voice replied...



JANE

Edward? Where are you? Wait for me!



ROCHESTER

Yes, yes...but how could you know that?



JANE

The secrets of your heart

Are like the secrets of the house

They have finally been revealed



ROCHESTER

There is no more to hide

I have looked death in the face

And though a part of me has died



BOTH

I will never lose faith

I will never lose heart

For you have restored my trust

And I know you're afraid

I'm as scared as you are

But willing to be brave

Brave enough for love



ROCHESTER

And now I have your hand



JANE

Clutching mine with all its might

Holding on for precious life



ROCHESTER

The purifying flame

Has washed us clean of all our fears



BOTH

It was a miracle of God

I will never lose faith

I will never lose heart

For you have restored my trust

And I know you're afraid

I'm as scared as you are

But willing to be brave

Brave enough for love

And when I heard your voice

Beyond the sky

I knew it was a sign from God above

One I could not deny



JANE

So, gentle audience, I married him.

No woman was ever nearer to her mate than I am,

ever more absolutely bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh.



ROCHESTER

The secret of the flame

Is that there is no more to hide

It cures our blindness

And our pride



BOTH

And we'll never lose faith

We will never lose heart

For you have restored my trust

And I know you're afraid

I'm as scared as you are

But willing to be brave

Brave enough for love



JANE

Edward continued blind the first two years of our marriage,

then, slowly, the sight in one eye began to return to him.



ENSEMBLE

Forgiveness

Is the mightiest sword

Forgiveness...



JANE

And when our firstborn was placed into his arms,

he could see that the boy had inherited his own eyes,

as they once were-large, brilliant and black.



JANE

On this occasion, we acknowledged with full hearts,

that God had tempered judgment with mercy.



ROCHESTER

I will never lose faith

I will never lose heart

For you have restored my trust



JANE

And I know you're afraid

I'm as scared as you are...



BOTH

But willing to be brave

Brave enough for love!



ROCHESTER, JANE AND ENSEMBLE

I will never lose faith

I will never lose heart

For you have restored my trust

And I know you're afraid

I'm as scared as you are

But willing to be brave

Brave enough for love!

I will never lose faith

I will never lose heart

For you have restored my trust

And I know you're afraid

I'm as scared as you are

But willing to be brave

Brave enough for love



JANE

Brave enough for love!



ALL

Brave enough for love
