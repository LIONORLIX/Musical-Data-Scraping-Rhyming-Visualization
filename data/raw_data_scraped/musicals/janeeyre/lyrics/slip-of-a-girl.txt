Slip of a Girl


MRS. FAIRFAX

I cannot believe it!



ADELE

What is it, Madame?



MRS. FAIRFAX

He means to marry her...a governess!

A slip of a girl

No breeding, no brass

No kinship, no class

A slip of a girl Who misplaces her grace

And disgraces her place

A slip of a girl

Who should settle for less

And confess a success

I'm outraged and appalled

Distressed and offended

Scandalized, mortified

Shocked and upended



ADELE

Is it true, mam'selle?



JANE

Yes, it is!



MRS. FAIRFAX

You're a slip of a girl

It is unlikely, I fear

He's in love with you, dear



JANE

Mrs. Fairfax!



MRS. FAIRFAX

A slip of a girl!

Would you marry him when

You've no knowledge of men?

A slip of girl

I would beg you to purge

Your unvirginal urge

I'm fretted and anxious

Concerned and disturbed

Upset, apprehensive

Harassed and perturbed!

Oh, Jane, you must be careful...

I remember in my youth

I thought the same as you,

But men, my dear, will break your heart

While swearing to be true.



ROBERT

From Mr. Rochester, Miss.



JANE

Thank you, Robert...



MRS. FAIRFAX

But these are the Rochester jewels!



JANE

Oh, yes...



MRS. FAIRFAX

To be worn by a governess?

I'm astonished, alarmed

Perplexed and dumbfounded

Bewildered, embarrassed

Amazed and astounded



JANE

I don't know why he sent them. I told him I would not wear them.



MRS. FAIRFAX

Not wear them?

And who are you to say you will not wear jewels given

to you by Mr. Edward Fairfax Rochester?

A slip of a girl

Whose form, I'll be sworn

He should scorn to adorn



JANE

No, indeed, Mrs. Fairfax...



MRS. FAIRFAX

A slip of a girl

Who'd be blessed, at the best

To be fetchingly dressed!



JANE

I shall not wear them!



MRS. FAIRFAX

A slip of a girl

Who'll do as she's told

Or be wholly cajoled,

Laughable, impudent

Brazen, audacious

Saucy, impertinent

Bold and ungracious



ADELE

Ooh, voila!



ROBERT

From the tailor at Milcote, Miss.



JANE

Oh, yes, thank you.



MRS. FAIRFAX

So this is the dress?



JANE

Do you like it?



MRS. FAIRFAX

Like it? Well, I...

I remember, long ago

When I wore such a dress...

He died, poor man, and broke my heart

Still broken, I confess



JANE

I'm very sorry to hear that, Mrs. Fairfax...



MRS. FAIRFAX

A slip of a girl

Insipidly built

Ill-equipped, to the hilt



JANE

Mrs. Fairfax...



MRS. FAIRFAX

You're a slip of a girl

And I'll bet he'll not let

You be more than a pet

He's twenty years older

Aesthetics won't let it

Be more than a friendship

You'd better forget it



JANE

No, indeed, Mrs. Fairfax. Edward is young...



MRS. FAIRFAX

Edward?



JANE

He's young in his heart.



MRS. FAIRFAX

Really?



JANE

He loves me, I'm sure.



MRS. FAIRFAX

Oh, dear, I don't know...



JANE

I solemnly swear...



MRS. FAIRFAX

Love is a great thing...



JANE

Our love will endure



MRS. FAIRFAX

Well, then...

I'm thrilled, I'm enchanted

Enraptured, excited

Gratified, tickled...

I trust I'm invited?

I'm charmed, I'm disarmed!

Jane Eyre, I'm delighted!
