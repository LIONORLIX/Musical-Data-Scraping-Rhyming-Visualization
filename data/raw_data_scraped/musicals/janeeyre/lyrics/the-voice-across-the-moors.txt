The Voice Across the Moors


ST. JOHN RIVERS

In the light of the virgin evening

In the vale of a midnight blue

God has seen I'm at last rewarded

He has sent me to you

And I hear His divine commandments

And I sail His celestial sea

In the harmony of the heavens

He's proclaimed to me

Jane, you must be a missionary wife

Jane, you will have a visionary life

The rock of ages is yours to lean on

Jane, you were formed

For labour, not love

Jane, show your faith

In the heavens above

For now I claim you

In holy marriage

Marry me, Jane Eyre. Let God and time show us the worth of our love.



JANE

If it were God's will I should marry you, I could vow to it here and now!



ST. JOHN

Then pray. Pray for His guidance. He will show you the way.



JANE

What can I do now, my precious Lord?

Would this union be my best reward?

Is this why I've landed here

Frozen on his doorstep?

Is this part of your eternal plan?

Deep in my secret soul

Oh God, I pray

Show me the road to take

And light my way

Give me a sign, my Lord

And I will promise to obey



ROCHESTER

Jane...

Jane...

Jane

I'll go with him as his wife



ROCHESTER

Jane...



JANE

If it's Your will, I'll obey



ROCHESTER

Jane...



JANE

Oh, God! What is it?



ROCHESTER

Jane...



JANE

Edward?



ROCHESTER

Jane, Jane, Jane...



JANE

Edward! Edward! Where are you?



ST. JOHN

Jane, what is it? What do you hear?



JANE

Edward?



ROCHESTER

Jane:



JANE

Edward! Where are you? Wait for me!



ROCHESTER

Jane!



JANE

I hear your cherished voice

Across the moorland skies
