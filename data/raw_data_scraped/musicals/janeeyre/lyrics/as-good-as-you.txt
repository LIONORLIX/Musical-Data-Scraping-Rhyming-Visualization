As Good as You


ROCHESTER

Love!

Love is like a virus we're infected with

You're so naive

Wouldn't it be wonderful

If life was just as you perceive?

Women are inhuman, worthless

Hard and savage

On the average

Never to be trusted

Completely maladjusted, it's true

And if I'd not loved a few

I might have been as good as you

She was my flame, my gallic sylph

I was her fool's delight

She put me in her spell and turned my

Rage to trust in just one night

With appetites for pleasure

We would search for buried treasure

In the excess of temptation

I thought it my salvation, it's true

And if I had thought things through

I might have been as good as you

She found me handsome

My opera dancer

And like a fool I believed it was true

I held the world inside my hands, a man

Full in his prime

When she left me for another

Pierced my heart a second time

"Nothing lasts forever," she said

"Find the door yourself, dear, won't you?

Think me still your flower

I've treasured every hour, it's true

And if I had loved you, too

I might have been as good as you."

I came upon her some time later

The years had not been very kind

She has this child, Adele

Said she was mine, as well

"Nothing lasts forever, Edward

Take good care and, oh yes

Won't you take our lovely daughter?

For you see, dear, I don't want her

But I'm still your flower

I'll just bloom elsewhere

Tell her my soul is in heaven, with God"

Miss Eyre, I tell you this

Because I want you to know

That I, with some luck

Without shame, without blame

Or the curse of my name

Might have been as good as you
