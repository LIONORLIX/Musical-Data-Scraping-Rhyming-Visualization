Sweet Liberty


JANE

It's seven o' clock in the morning

I lift my eyes to autumn skies

I look out through the graveyard

A silhouetted swallow files

He flies to distant countries

I lose him just behind a cloud

I yearn to be that swallow

And go where I am not allowed

Over mountains, over oceans

Heaven take me away

For I long for my liberty

For sweet liberty I pray

It's nine o' clock in the morning

I teach what's been instilled in me

But is this all we're meant for

Condemned to mere tranquility?

Well, women feel as men do

We must engage out minds and souls

Let us, like our brothers

Let our worth define our roles

Breaking custom and convention

Let tradition give way

For we all need our liberty

For sweet liberty we pray

And I wake from my bed

With the urge to depart

And to follow the dreams of my heart

It's twelve o' clock in the pitch black night

I can't contain my wanderlust

I seek a new adventure

I search the skies because I must

I hunger for new faces

To find a better destiny

And fly among the swallows

Far beyond the troubled sea

Over mountains, over oceans

Heaven take me away

For I love for my liberty

For sweet liberty I pray

'Cross the rivers

Past the highlands

With God's wind in my hair

I look out over boundless skies



JANE

My spirits rise

And carry me

Carry me

Beyond my past

Where I will find

Sweet liberty

My liberty

At last



ENSEMBLE

My spirits rise

And carry me

Heaven let my freedom

Carry me

Where I will find

Liberty

At last
