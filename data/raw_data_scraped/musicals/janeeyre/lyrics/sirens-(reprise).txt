Sirens (Reprise)


JANE

What can I do, I feel his love

Would I be judged my God above

If I were to stay here by his side?

Surely there would be no blame

If I do not take his name

I'll have his heart

But I'll not be his bride

And we could sail away

Get lost at sea

Where we could lose ourselves

Where we are blind and free

For as sirens call the sailors

He calls to me

Lord, is this to be my worth?

I pray there was a reason for my birth

Is this what you would have me do?

Break my sacred vow to you?

Destroy the laws of heaven here on earth?



JANE

What can I do, I feel his love

Would I be judged by God aboveIf I am not there to hear his call?

Curse the passion,

dim the flameIf I cannot take his nameI cannot take anything at all Oh,

let me sail away

And make this vow

That what my heart wantsI will not allow

For as sirens call the sailors...



ROCHESTER

Jane, don't you seeNo one is injured

By this breach

Jane, don't you see?

Our spring of life

You are my lifeMy second self

Oh, be my wifeMy little elf

You are my Jane Oh, say my name



JANE

He calls me now
