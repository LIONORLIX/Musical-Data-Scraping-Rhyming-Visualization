Beautiful Boy


GABRIELLE

And now he's gone,

The only light that ever shone within these walls,

That made my life worth living,

The single thing that ever brought me any joy at all.

My beautiful boy, I've closed the door and let him go, my beautiful boy.



The echo of his voice, the memory of his rough-and-tumble youth

Are all I have to cling to.

Now I've cut the ties that bind and turned him loose, my beautiful boy.

My beautiful boy, I've set him on the wind and pray for him, my beautiful boy.



Surrendering to emptiness, I look around and all that's left

Is life without the one thing I adore.

But should the truth be told, I would have offered up my soul to see him go.

My beautiful, beautiful boy.



He'll never know the tears I held back as my heart was breaking,

The pain that only mothers know.

The sacrifice of seeing all you ever loved forsaken.

My beautiful boy, may God's love go with you, my beautiful boy.



Surrendering to emptiness, I look around and all that's left

Is life without the one thing I adore.

I'll bear no regret.

I would have saved my dying breath to set him free.

My beautiful, beautiful boy.



My beautiful, beautiful boy
