I'll Never Have That Chance


CLAUDIA

I have spent so many years

In fancy lace and beaded gowns.

I have set my hair a hundred ways.

My face, I've painted up and powdered down.



This body bares a telling tale.

They pinch my cheek and wish me well.

For all their patronizing smiles

This frame remains a prison cell.

They look at me and what they see

Is one more painted china doll.

A sweet and coddled daughter with

A painted fan, a sweet treat and a parasol.

Inside of me there lives someone

Who never felt a mother's love.

Who could have heard the bells on Sunday

Peeling in the church of God.

Who would have loved a rainy day

And never had to fear the fire.

Instead I hunger for the vein

That holds the life force I desire.

Imagine walking down the aisle.

I'll never have that chance.

A wedding dress of virgin white.

The very best from France.

The arching of a rainbow

And the way the colors dance.

Sunlight playing on my skin.

I'll never have that chance.

Oh no, I'll never have that chance...

The mirror with its cruel laugh

Reflects this ageless face of mine.

In taunting ways as if to say

"Childhood is not something you can leave behind."

Inside of me there lives someone

Who could have been somebody's wife.

Who could have seen their children grow.

Who could have had a normal life.

Who could have firecely loved a man

And felt his kisses deep and moist.

Instead I give this kiss of death.

And in this I have no choice.

The pleasures that he stripped away.

I'll never have these things.

My daydreams that he tore apart

The night he clipped my wings.

His lies that have denied me a passionate romance.

The miracle of giving birth

I'll never have that chance.

Oh no, I'll never have that chance.

I'll never have that chance...
