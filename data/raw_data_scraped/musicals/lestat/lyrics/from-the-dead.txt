From the Dead


LESTAT

Before today, this bloody field was my own hunting ground.

I stalked my prey, I tracked it down, and moved without a sound.

Then, like a plague, this wolf pack came and tipped the scales of change.

How to strange to be the hunter and then become the game.



What I set out to kill found me and, henceforth, blood did flow.

My horse came out from under me, my dogs died in the snow.

But fear was never present, I was calm and unafraid.

The man I was before this fight is ever changed today.



My blood, it roars like thunder in this mortal breast,

Purified by battle and the smell of death.

The blood-red scent of slaughter fills my lungs.

And from the dead a new awakening comes.



And from the dead I feel a strength I've never known,

A thrill that fills my heart, yet chills me to the bone.

And from the dead, the power of the wolf is torn.

It seems as if from death a whole new world is born.



See me...wolfkiller!

See me...wolfkiller!

See me!
