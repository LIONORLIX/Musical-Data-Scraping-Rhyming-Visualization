Right Before My Eyes


LESTAT

How luminous he looks to me,

so radiant and glorious.

One savage kiss is all he'd need,

to change his life and make this night victorious.



What princes of the moon we'd be;

Two blazing beacons in the dark.

Desire drives me to take him now.

No force on earth would ever tear him from my heart.



But why do I go back and forth?

What is this doubt that clouds my thoughts?

Don't waste the chance,

and let the night pass by!

He's mine to take,

he's right before my eyes.



And so my consciense speaks to me,

of selfishness and consequence.

The danger that from death I'd make,

a stolen soul who was blessed with innocence.



But such a kingdom could be ours;

a wonderous world beyond compare!

With his bright fire, and I wish it so,

surely he'd agree this gift is one that should be shared?



So, why do I go back and forth?

What is this doubt that clouds my thoughts?

Don't waste the chance and let the night pass by!

He's mine to take, he's right before my eyes.



Everything I really need,

is standing here in front of me.

The one thing that my heart should not deny,

is out of reach, but right before my eyes...

is out of reach,

but right before my eyes
