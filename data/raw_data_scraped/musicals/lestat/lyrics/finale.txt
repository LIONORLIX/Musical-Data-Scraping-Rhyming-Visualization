LESTAT

I'm tired. I am torn.

The cruel light of dawn

Comes now to claim back my soul.

Take me away.

Carry me back to Your home.

GABRIELLE

Rise up my boy.

The night is ours.

Eternity, and all the things we've missed

Could be ours to share forever

Bound together by the crimson kiss.

My son so dear!

The world's out there!

LESTAT & GABRIELLE

Destiny calls!

And we should not resist!

For you and I have memories

Bound together by the crimson kiss!
