After All This Time


ARMAND

What taste is this

Upon my lips?

A taste so sweet, what can it be? What is this scent upon the air

That fills my lungs and comforts me?

And whispers low

How does it feel?

To savor up such just revenge.

To smell the fragrancy of loss?

And drunkenly inhale his pain.

Oh, can it be

Your countenance is stripped of all it's dash and dare? And what of your bold confidence?

Could it have drowned in your despair?

And after all this time

I wash my hands of your charade.

And celebrate your fall from grace.

Preserve that sad look on your face.

And praise what God might manifest

Himself to beings such as us.

For vengeance that at last is mine

Comes sweetly after all this time.

Lestat

You never meant to help me, did you?

Armand

You, who destroyed all of it!? You took everything! What made you think I would help you?



ARMAND

If you'll allow me to recall

How my requests were swept aside.

At every instance

I beseached you,

I was shut out and denied.

You shattered what I once concieved

From the moment you arrived.

And now you wonder why I gloat here

Reveling in your grand demise.

You're arrogant beyond comtempt.

You beg to share my precious blood.

I'd no sooner you in my veins

Then to see you with the ones you love.

And after all this time

I wash my hands of your charade.

And celebrate your fall from grace.

Preserve that sad look on your face.

And praise what God might manifest

Himself to beings such as us.

For vengeance that at last is mine

Come sweetly after all this time...
