Embrace It


LOUIS

Where is the glory in this new me?

Where is the feeling of achievement in the shadows of the evening?

Where is the satisfaction in your killing creed?

Who am I now?

I don't know.

I must question my existance and deal with your persistance

That somehow and some way you set me free.

And I don't think that I can take another night of these instincts that I fight.

This overwhelming dread of feeling damned inside.

LESTAT

Oh God help us, just look at you.

Shrinking away from my point of view.

Showering me with your pious blame.

The gift that I gave is exempt from shame.

Embrace it, embrace it.

It makes no sense without the strength to push your grief aside.

This pleasure you'll deny.

Embrace it, embrace it.

LOUIS

You seek my trust after your lies.

Well, in this superficial splendor

The decades will seem endless.

And will the drudgery of torment be my bride?

LESTAT

What lies are these of which you speak?

Are you so blinded by contrition?

That you see in my position

A failure to practice what I preach.

I don't think that I could take another night of your craving for the light.

This wilted flower act that questions wrong from right.

LOUIS

Oh God help me, just look at you.

Striding through Hell with nothing to prove.

A glorious ghost on infinity's views.

Then if it's to be tell me what should I do?

LESTAT

Embrace it, embrace it.

LOUIS

How can it be that you achieved this condition with such ease?

There's none of you in me.

LESTAT

Embrace it, embrace it.

LESTAT & LOUIS

So God help us to see it through.

Two of Lucifer's angels are on the loose.

LESTAT

Oh merciful and majestic boy,

The gift that I bestowed is to be enjoyed. Embrace it,

LESTAT & LOUIS

Embrace it.

LOUIS

What should I do with the likes of you?

Your wild and reckless ways.

Your cunning to persuade.

LESTAT

Embrace it, embrace it.
