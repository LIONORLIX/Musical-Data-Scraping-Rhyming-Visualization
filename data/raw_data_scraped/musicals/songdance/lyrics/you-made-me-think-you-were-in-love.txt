You Made Me Think You Were In Love


You made me think you were in love,

you made me think that I was all you'd need.

You made me think you were in love,

if they gave Oscars for deceit you would win.

Plastic man, hear me if you can.



You made me think you were in love,

you could've used your charm on someone else.

You made me think you were the one

it's hard to see the truth when dazzled by lights.

Hollow man, break down if you can.



Exit. Way out. Exit. Fade out.

It's a wrap, no more takes, we're through.

Exit. Print it. Exit. Goodbye.

Find someone else at a theater near you.

I've seen this movie and I hated it before.

Fade out. Exit. Cut.



You made me think you were in love,

we're both too old to play these kind of games.

I get the feeling when you see me,

you see an actress who's pretending to cry.

Busy man, see me if you can.



Exit. Way out. Exit. Fade out.

It's a wrap, no more takes, we're through.

Exit. Print it. Exit. Goodbye.

Find someone else at a theater near you.

I've had enough of you lies and your phony deals.

I've had enough of your name dropping boring meals.

I've had it with things, and Sheldon, how good it feels.

Fade out. Exit. Cut!
