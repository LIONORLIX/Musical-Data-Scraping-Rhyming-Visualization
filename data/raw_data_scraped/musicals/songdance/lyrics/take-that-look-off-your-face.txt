Take That Look Off Your Face


I can't quite believe it, I'm actually here,

The one place on earth I want to be.

New York is just short of perfection they say.

The one thing it lacks is me.



It's all so amazing, the size and the noise.

Why it's still alive at five A.M.

And that drive in the eyes of New York girls, oo,

I'd like to be one of them.



Take that look off your face.

What's the joke, if you please?

Oh, I knew what you'd say,

English girls come by plane loads each day

and you fear that I'll lose myself like so many do.

Well, I've got news for you:

I'm frightened too.



I'm glad to have you, Viv, a friend over here

who's had a whole year to learn the ropes.

This guy that I'm with, this drummer from Queens,

he's crazy, but I have hopes.



Take that look off your face.

Oh, I knew how you'd be.

You think I'm the same girl

who lets men take advantage of me, here's one more.

And he's possibly using me, it's true.

Still, I'm here in New York;

Who's using who?!



Take that look off your face!

Don't go off in a tizz.

I am here to have fun

finding out what America is.

Can't you see I'm no longer the mess I used to be.

You're my best friend and yet,

you don't know me.



So get used to me here.

I am gonna work hard,

get my card, have a brilliant career,

stay in love, and outshine any New York girl you'd see.

If you think that I won't,

you don't know me!
