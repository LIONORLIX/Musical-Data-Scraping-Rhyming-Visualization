Capped Teeth And Caesar Salad (Reprise)


Capped teeth and Caesar salad.

Blood clot Beverly Hills.

When business starts to dip

wheel out the glucose strip.

Have a cutthroat time

with a twist of lime.



Dreamers trapped in a jewel box.

Big names fading away.

It?s like a wonderland

except the laughter?s canned.

I?ll call you back and,

have a nice day.



[Thanks to Hayley for lyrics]
