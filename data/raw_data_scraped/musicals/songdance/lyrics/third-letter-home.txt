Third Letter Home


Mum, this letter is a quick one cuz

I'm working day and night now.

If things keep going well

I'll be the female Calvin Klein.

Viv's been a smashing friend, Mum,

introducing me to buyers.

People find my hats outrageous,

which in New York means they're fine!



No, I never hear from Sheldon,

but I read what he is up to.

He's working on a musical

'bout Rommel as a boy.

Mum, I've never seen a drink here

that isn't full of ice cubes.

And I've ever met a waiter here

who doesn't say "Enjoy."



I have met this married man, Mum.

Now don't go off the deep end.

It's just a bit of nonsense, oh,

I've made that very clear.

He's got four lovely children.

Well, I've only seen their pictures.

I never really miss him,

but I like it when he's here.



I know you won't approve, Mum.

I feel I must have someone.

I know if Dad could see me...
