Let Me Finish


Just what time of night do you call this?

Well, it's three A.M. It's my first night here;

where the hell were you?

Let me finish, I said let me finish.

Of course, that's the answer, you're a musician.

No prob.  I've been rather busy all evening;

Mary Ellen called, Margarita called, Jane or Janet called.

Let me finish, I said let me finish.

This is not what I came here for.

I came all of this way to be with you.

If I like being bored I'd have stayed in art school.

A New York girl wouldn't stand for this!

This is not what I came here for.

Don't you know what this whole trip means to me?

I am here cuz of you and cuz my friend Vivian says

I've the talent to get on here.

Do you think that I don't? I do!

Did you really think I was joking?!

You have got a nerve, no I didn't write Janet's number down!

I can't believe that you actually said that.

I'd have to be bonkers to put up with this.

Where the hell did I put my bags.

I really think there's nothing to keep me here.

And if you call me "Emma Baby" one more time I will scream.

That's it! Let me finish.

I don't even care where I go!

I don't often stand up for myself,

but it's time that I started.

Oh, by the way, Chuck, I spilled tea on you bongos.

Well that's that, can't think of a reason to stay.

Goodbye. And I'll pay you back for the air fare.



Please don't start to make excuses,

you don't want a second chance.

All this is is empty rubbish.

Spare me please the song and dance.



All I want is something honest,

that's what's gone from this romance.

We had fun, but now it's over.

There, goodbye, no song and dance.
