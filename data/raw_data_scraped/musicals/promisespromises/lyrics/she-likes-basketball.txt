She Likes Basketball


She likes basketball, how about that?

We've got something in common to talk about

Basketball



She likes basketball, how about that?

I have some place to take her when we go out

Basketball



Whoever would've dreamed, ever would've thought?

That my favorite girl likes my favorite sport

Like any other kid, I would make-believe

With a ball in my hand



I'd dribble right past

All the others real fast

And I'd be six-foot eight

And my jump shot was really great



She likes basketball, isn't that wild?

It's an omen that good things are on their way

Things to share



We share basketball, couldn't you die?

From a simple beginning like this

We may get somewhere

It's nice to dream

Someday it might be, basketball and me



Whoever would've dreamed, ever would've thought?
