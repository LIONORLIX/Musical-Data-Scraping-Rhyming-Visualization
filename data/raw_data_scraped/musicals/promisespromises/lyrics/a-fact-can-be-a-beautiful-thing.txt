A Fact Can Be A Beautiful Thing


And a fact can be a beautiful thing

When the fact I'm facin' is you

A fact can be a terrible thing

When the dreams you've been dreaming fall through



Forget the past

And think about the present

Right now is everything



Forget the past

And think about the present

The present's very pleasant



Who cares what the future will bring?

There's just no predicting a thing

Don't wait for a miracle



Because it's Christmas

Not a time to be

Alone with memories



Christmas

It's supposed to be a happy holiday

Throw a little joy my way

You could really make my day

Throw a little joy my way



And a fact can be a beautiful thing

When I see what I'm seein' in you

A fact can be a wonderful thing

When your hopes to be happy come true



What's gone is gone

And don't you ever doubt it

Wake up and start to live



What's gone is gone

So learn to live without it

And never think about it



Who cares what the future will bring?

There's just no predicting a thing

Don't wait for a miracle



Because it's Christmas

Not a time to be

Alone with memories



Christmas

It's supposed to be a happy holiday

Throw a little joy my way

Do we really have to stay?

Throw a little joy my way



Throw a little joy my way

Do we really have to stay?

Throw a little joy my way



Because it's Christmas

Just the perfect day for us to

Dance and sing



Christmas

It's supposed to be a happy holiday

Happy holiday

So throw a little joy my way



Who cares what the future will bring?

There's just no predicting a thing

Don't wait for a miracle

Don't wait for a miracle

Don't wait for a miracle

Don't wait for a miracle
