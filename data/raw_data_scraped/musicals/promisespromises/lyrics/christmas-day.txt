Christmas Day


Christmas Day is here and so are we

Time for children and presents

And Christmas tree happiness



Christmas Day is all that it should be

Lights and carols and holly

And all kinds of loveliness



Christmas bells

Ringing out goodwill to men

And peace on earth

Everything they taught you when

You were a child

The things a Child once taught the world



If Christmas day is really in your heart

You don't have to save up

All your love to give once a year



Try to give, learn to live

Each day like Christmas Day



A chair is still a chair

Even when there's no one's sitting there
