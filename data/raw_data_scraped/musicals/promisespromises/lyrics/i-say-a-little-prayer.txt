I Say A Little Prayer


The moment I wake up

Before I put on my make-up

I say a little prayer for you



While combin' my hair now

And wonderin' what dress to wear now

I say a little prayer for you



Oh, forever, forever, you'll stay in my heart

And I will love you

Forever and ever, we never will part

Oh, how I love you



Together, together, that's how it must be

To live without you

Would only mean heartbreak for me



I run for the bus, dear

While ridin' I think of us, dear

I say a little prayer for you



At work I just take time

And all through my coffee-break time

I say a little prayer for you



Oh, forever, forever, you'll stay in my heart

And I will love you

Forever and ever, we never will part

Oh, how I'll love you



Together, together, that's how it must be

To live without you

Would only mean heartbreak for me



My darling, believe me

For me there is no one but you

Please love me too

I'm in love with you

Answer my prayer

Say you love me too
