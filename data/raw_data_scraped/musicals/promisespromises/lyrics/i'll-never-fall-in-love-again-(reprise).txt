I'll Never Fall In Love Again (reprise)


Don't tell me what it's all about

'cause I've been there and I'm glad I'm out

Out of those chains, those chains that bind you

That is why I'm here to remind you



What do you get when you fall in love?

You only get lies and pain and sorrow

So far at least until tomorrow

I'll never fall in love a- gain

No, no, I'll never fall in love again
