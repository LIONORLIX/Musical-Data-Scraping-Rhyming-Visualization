A Young Pretty Girl Like You


Put my glasses out

On the top of your head

On the top of your head

You won't see a thing



And the less you see

The sooner you'll be

Smiling, laughing

And happy, oh, yes



The less you see

The better you feel

The better you feel

The quicker you smile



And the quicker you smile

The sooner you'll be happy

Happy



And a young pretty girl like you

Pretty as she can be

Really should be happy

Happy



Try to take my stethoscope

Plug it into your ears

Plug it into your ears

You won't hear a thing

Hello, hello



When there's too much noise

Nobody enjoys

Smiling, laughing

And happy, oh yes



And the less you see

The better you feel

The better you feel

The quicker you smile



And the quicker you smile

The sooner you'll be happy

Happy



And a young pretty girl like you

Pretty as she can be

Really should be happy

Happy



Try to open up your mouth

Let me look at your throat

Let me look at your throat

Don't you say a thing



'Cause the less you say

The sooner you'll play

Lipstick, powder

And girl-games, oh yes



And the less you see

The better you feel

The better you feel

The quicker you smile



And the quicker you smile

The sooner you'll be happy

Happy



And a young pretty girl like you

Why don't you take a look?

Really should be happy

Happy



Yes, a young pretty girl like you

With all you've been through

Really should be happy

Smiling, laughing, giggling

Happy
