Turkey Lurkey Time


It's turkey lurkey time

Tom turkey ran away but he just came home

It's turkey lurkey time

He's really home to stay, never one to roam



Let us make a wish

And may all our wishes come true

A snowy, blowy Christmas

A mistletoey Christmas

A turkey lurkey Christmas to you

A turkey lurkey Christmas to you



It's loosey goosey time

She was a gadabout but she's back again

It's loosey goosey time

Her time is running out and we all know when



Let us make a wish

And may all our wishes come true

A snowy, blowy Christmas

A mistletoey Christmas

A loosey goosey Christmas to you

A loosey goosey Christmas to you



Turkey lurkey, loosey goosey

Some for uncle Joe, some for cousin Lucy

Everybody gather 'round the table

Dig in, dinner's being served

Eat all the turkey you are able



Can't you see a partridge in a pear tree?

Climb up and bring it down for me

That's something I would like to see



A snowy, blowy Christmas

A mistletoey Christmas

A turkey lurkey Christmas to you

You, you, you



Jingle bells, jingle bells

Jingle bells, jingle bells

Jingle bells, jingle bells

Jingle bells, jingle bells

Jingle bells, jingle bells

Jingle bells, jingle bells

Jingle bells, jingle bells

Jingle bells, jingle bells

Jingle bells, jingle bells
