Whoever You Are


Sometimes your eyes look blue to me

Although I know they're really green

I seem to see you differently

Changing as I'm treated kindly

Or treated meanly



From moment to moment

You're two different people

Faithful and warm when I'm in your arms

And then when you leave

You're so untrue



But however you are

Deep down, whatever you are

Whoever you are, I love you



Sometimes I feel you're mine alone

And yet I'm sure it's just not so

I get this feeling on my own

After I've learnt if you're staying

Or if you're going



From moment to moment

You're two different people

Someone I know as the man I love

Or the man I wish

I never knew



But however you are

Deep down, whatever you are

Whoever you are, I love you



Sometimes your eyes look blue to me
