Our Little Secret


All the other apples

Are spoiled and they're rotten

Out of the basket they'll go



Your loyalty is something

That won't be forgotten



And there's one thing I promise you

I can keep secrets too



Oh, it's our little secret

Little secret, little secret



I'm gonna buy me a hat

And keep our secret under that



It's our little secret

Little secret, little secret



I'll even stop counting sheep

To prove I don't talk when I sleep



We've got a little plot that we can tell

Just one another

There's isn't anyone that we can trust

Except each other



That's why we'll never tell a soul

What it's all about

They'll never get a chance to find out



There'll be questions

I won't answer

There'll be gossip

Let them gossip

We don't care

Just put your trust in me



It's our little secret

And I'll keep it locked inside me

'Cause it's no one else's business

But our own anyhow



'Cause it's no one else's business

But our own anyhow



Our little secret

Oh, yes, it's yours and mine

Our little secret

For now and all the time

We'll stick together

To keep our little secret now
