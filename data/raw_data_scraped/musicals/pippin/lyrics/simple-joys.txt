Simple Joys


[LEADING PLAYER]

Well I'll sing you the story of a sorrowful lad

Had everything he wanted, didn't want what he had

He had wealth and pelf and fame and name and all of

That noise

But he didn't have none of those simple joys

His life seemed purposeless and flat

Aren't you glad you don't feel like that?



So he ran from all the deeds he'd done, he ran

Things he'd just begun

He ran from himself, now that's mighty far to run

Out into the country where he played as a boy

He knew he had to find him some simple joys

He wanted someplace warm and green

We all could use a change of scene



Sweet summer evenings, hot wine and bread

Sharing your supper, sharing your bed

Simple joys have a simple voice:

That says why not go ahead?

Wouldn't you rather be a left-handed flea

A crab on a slab at the bottom of the sea

Than a man who never learns how to be free

Not 'til he's underground



Sweet summer evenings, sapphire skies

Feasting your belly

Feasting your eyes

Simple joys have a simple voice:

It says time's a living spice

And wouldn't you

Rather be a left-handed flea

A crab on a slab at the bottom of the sea

A newt on the root of a banyan tree

Than a man who never learns how to be free

Not till he's cold and dead



Sweet summer evenings, so full of sound

Gaining a lover

Gaining a pound

Simple joys have a simple voice that says take a look around

And wouldn't you

Rather be a left-handed flee

A crab on a slab at the bottom of the sea

A newt on the root of a banyan tree

A fig on a twig in Galilee

Than a man who never learns how to be free

Not till the day

Not till the day

Not till the day he dies!
