Kind Of Woman


[CATHERINE]

I'm your average ordinary kind of woman

Competent and neat

Making life a treat

Others as nice

You meet often I know

At least once or twice

Every decade or so



I'm your everyday, customary kind of woman

Practical as salt

Modest to a fault

Conservative with a budget

Liberal with a meal

Just your average ideal



My telling you this

May seem sudden and strange

It may not interest you much at all right now

But things change

Things change

Still I'll understand if I'm not your kind of woman

Anyone can make

One terrible mistake

But I've no special glamour

No bait I can twirl

For I'm just a plain, everyday

Commonplace, come-what-may

Average, ordinary

wonderful girl!
