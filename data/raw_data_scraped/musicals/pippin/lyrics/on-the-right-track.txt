On The Right Track


[LEADING PLAYER]

You look frenzied, you look frazzled

Peaked as any alp

Flushed and rushed and razzle-dazzled

Dry your lips, damp your scalp

Now I can see you're in a rut in

Disarray

And I'm not one to butt in

But in fact I must say

If you'd take it easy, trust awhile

Don't look blue, don't look back

You'll pull through in just awhile

'Cause you're on th right track



[PIPPIN]

On the right track

On the right track

On the right track

On the right track



[LEADING PLAYER]

Uh huh Uh huh

Take it easy, sonny

Take it easy, sonny

Take it easy



[LEADING PLAYER]

Why look flurried



[PIPPIN]

Flustered



[LEADING PLAYER]

Keep those



[PIPPIN]

Hopes aloft



[LEADING PLAYER]

Keep cool as custard



[PIPPIN]

Trying hard



[LEADING PLAYER]

Stepping soft



[BOTH]

There's no trick to staying sensible

Despite each cul-de-sac

'Cause each step's indispensable

When you're on the right track



[PIPPIN]

On the right track

On the right track

On the right track

On the right track



[LEADING PLAYER]

Uh huh Uh huh

Take it easy, sonny

Take it easy, sonny

Take it easy



[LEADING PLAYER]

Many when things get dank will feel their grip go

We stay tranquil, spirits high, pulses low



[PIPPIN]

But! What I've left behind looks trifling

What's ahead looks black

Am I doomed to spend my life a-lingering on



[LEADING PLAYER]

Lingering on



[PIPPIN]

Just lingering on



[BOTH]

Malingering on the right



[PIPPIN]

Oh, I'll never find it.... never.... never....never....

never!



[LEADING PLAYER]

Easy baby...

You're on the right track!
