[LEADING PLAYER]

Think about the sun, Pippin

Think about her golden glance

How she lights the world up

Well, now it's your chance

With the guardian of splendor

Inviting you to dance

Pippin

Think about the sun



[LEADING PLAYER]

Think about your life, Pippin



[PLAYER]

Days are tame and nights the same



[LEADING PLAYER]

Now think about the beauty



[LEADING PLAYER AND PLAYER]

In one perfect flame



And the angels of the morning

Are calling out your name



[ALL]

Pippin



[LEADING PLAYER]

[ALL]

Sun



Think about your life, Pippin

Think about the dreams you planned

Think about the moment

That's so close at hand

When the power and the glory

Are there at your command

Pippin

Think about your life



Think about the sun, Pippin

Think about her golden glance

How she lights the world up

Well, now it's your chance

With the guardian of splendor

Inviting you to dance

Pippin

Pippin, think about your life



Rivers belong where they can ramble

Eagles belong where they can fly



[PIPPIN]

I'm not a river or a giant bird

That soars to the sea

And if I'm never tied to anything

I'll never be free



I wanted magic shows and miracles

Mirages to touch

I wanted such a little thing from life

I wanted so much

I never came close, my love

We never came near

It never was there

I think it was here



They showed me crimson, gold and lavender

A shining parade

But there's no color I can have on earth

That won't finally fade

When I wanted worlds to paint

And costumes to wear

I think it was here

'Cause it never was there



I wanted magic shows and miracles

Mirages to touch

I wanted such a little thing from life

I wanted so much
