Extraordinary


[PIPPIN]

Patching the roof and pitching the hay

Is not my idea of a perfect day

When you're extraordinary

You gotta do extraordinary things



I'm not the type who loses sleep

Over the size of the compost heap

When you're extraordinary

You think about extraordinary things



That's the reason I'll never be

The kind of man who dwells

On how moths got into the tapestry

Or why the dungeon smells



Oh, it's hard to feel special, it's hard to feel big

Feeding the turtle and walking the pig

It's so secondary

To someone who is very

Extraordinary like me



If the moat won't stop leaking

And the goat won't stop shrieking

And the griffin keeps losing its hair

If the west wing is rotting

And our best wine is clotting

Well, I'm terribly sorry but I don't care



I've got to be someone who lives

All of his life in superlatives

When you're extraordinary

You gotta do extraordinary things



Every so often a man has a day

He truly can call his

Well, here I am to seize my day

If someone would just tell me when the hell it is



Oh give me my chance, and give me my wings

And don't make me think about everyday things

They're unnecessary

To someone who is very

Extraordinary

Like me!
