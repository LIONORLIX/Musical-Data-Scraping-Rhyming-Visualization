Prayer for a Duck


[PIPPIN]

His breath has ebbed, his pulse is low

His feet are webbed, but even so

You must know

That although our tears are poised to burst

We've kept our faith warm through the worst

We haven't cursed our luck or run amuck

To prayer we've stuck

Please reward our pluck

And save this duck
