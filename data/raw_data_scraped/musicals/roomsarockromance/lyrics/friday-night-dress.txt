Friday Night Dress


Ian:

Don’t you look so pretty in your Friday night dress?

Your fingernails all bitten and your hair a perfect mess



Mommy lights the candles, daddy says prayers over wine

Bread upon the table

Salt the bread, drink the wine

House full of laughter

So very different than mine

Daddy on the unemployment line

A late, drunken mess



Don’t you look so pretty in your Friday night dress?

The whole of you, the soul of you, the sparkle of success

People are lucky, people are blind, people can’t see what’s in front of their eyes



Monica:

Like my house?



Ian:

Can I move in here?



Monica:

Sure, but I won’t be here long



Ian:

Where ya going?



Monica:

Anywhere but here



Ian:

Here’s as good as anywhere



Monica:

See you on Sunday

Temple Emanuel at three

Come a little early



Ian:

I’m never early for anything

Thanks for dinner, I liked the chopped liver

And the kosher wine was surprisingly fine



Monica:

Right



Ian:

Night

Didn’t you look so pretty in your Friday night dress?

The dream of you will send me off to sleep tonight a perfect mess

Didn’t you look so pretty?

Didn’t you look so pretty?

In your Friday night dress
