Clean


Ian:

Hi, my name is Ian

I’m an alcoholic, there I said it

Man, the ride is brutal

God, I need a drink so bad

I would sell my mother for a whiskey soda

If she were alive, but she isn’t

Being sober might drive me mad



Still the rhythm of the alcohol

Keeps kicking as I hit the wall

I’m jittering as 17

Ten days clean



Hi, my name’s still Ian

I fell off the wagon, now I’m back on

Man, the ride is bumpy

God, I love the drink so bad

Feel like I’m a little laddie playing football with my daddy

Getting all emotional, one minute I’m happy then sad



Still the rhythm of the alcohol

Keeps kicking as I hit the wall

Ninety days and counting now



This guy is coming round

There’s a center to him now

And the music, he has finding ways to navigate somehow

A million wake unsound

Mother, head become un-cleared

Self-assured and bloody scared

Just like all of us these days



Come open the heart

Let in some love

Stay clean



Hi, my name is Ian

I’m an alcoholic, there I said it

Man, the ride is brutal

Beautiful and mad

Time goes ticking, life is clicking into gear

It’s two years now that I’ve been sober

Best two years that I have never have



La-da-da-da

Every answer that I’m looking for

Always seems to end up at her door

So, what am I waiting for’

I’m clean!
