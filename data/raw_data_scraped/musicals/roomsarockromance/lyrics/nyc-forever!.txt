NYC Forever!


Monica:

Early every morning as the night is turning light

I walk awake the city through the traffic of the human being

Everybody wearing their invisible crown

As the sky turns a million shades of red downtown



It’s an avalanche of faces, the people of all races

The trash cans and the music and the unexpected flowers

The twinkle of the twin towers, the walking with a walk-man

The vicious, volley, wham-bam, pompano, ya-ya-ya-ya



Everybody’s telling me lately

Everything is gonna be fine

NYC Forever

This September, ‘77



Ian:

Underneath the covers, in the morning we are lovers

In the afternoon and evenings too, and all the hours in between

I’m visiting vistas I have never seen

All the colors of love seep low through my window



Both:

Walking through times square, hand-in-hand we stop



Monica:

Isn’t that way a coach checks sucked his lollipop’



Ian:

New wave blares on every stereo speaker



Both:

How we love our room above the Ritter and the bleaker



Everybody better remember

Everything is gonna be fine

NYC Forever

This September, ‘77



Monica:

Everywhere you turn opportunity



Ian:

Delivery



Monica:

Incredible



Ian:

A miracle



Monica:

For a girl like me



Ian:

For a guy like me



Monica:

It’s the rush of the rage



Ian:

Wish it was simpler



Monica:

The adrenaline bay



Ian:

Just me and her



Monica:       					   	   Ian:

The dog eats the dung      				The blur of

You hit the ground running     			The booze

Cause here you got nothing for nothing



Ian:

Pour more booze



Monica:

Nothing for nothing



Ian:

Pour more booze



Monica:

Come out with me tonight.

The Filthy Rat Bastards are hosting a party later at Skanks.



Ian:

Oh, that’s the third party in a row.



Monica:

No, it’s the same party. It just hasn’t finished yet.



Ian:

Lay down with me.



Monica:

Sounds fantastic, but this is business, darling.

I mean, show business isn’t all show.

Get some rest, our big night tomorrow.

C.B.G.B’s!

We gotta be great.



Ian:

Yeah, cheers.

The clock’s tick-tocking, and my mind’s sleep-walking

She’s always running and there’s always something

I’m all alone, so far from home

Oh, brother, am I her lover or her mother’



Good morning.

Hello, is this the liquor store’

I’m running out of whiskey

Would you bring me more, pretty please’

I got a gig tonight at CBGB’s



Monica:

Ian, no!

Tonight’s gonna be great!

After the show, promise me you’ll wait



Ian:

I’m thirsty as a hark

I’m full of fear and loathing

I’m sweating and my safety-pin’s holding up my clothing

Everything is coming together



Monica:

Everything’s gonna be fine



Both:

NYC forever

This September
