Fear Of Flying


Ian:

Fear of flying

Fear of dying

Fear of crashing into a mountain

Disappearing into the ocean

Fear of flying

Fear of dying

Nervous as a nerd

I’m yellow as a jar of lemon curd

I’m shaking as we’re taking off, all bound for heaven

Fear of flying



Need for drinking

Bar cart comes around with Tess, the stewardess

I have a double, then another

Fear of flying

Here comes Tess again, my new best friend

She takes me to the back of the 747

For a tet-a-tet and a cigarette

With Tess the Stewardess, I’m feeling better

Like her sweater, she likes mine

The fear of flying getting less

All thanks to Tess the Stewardess



In a silver box

A metal room

A cloudy mess

A sonic boom



Fear of flying

Fear of dying

Fear of coming

Fear of going

Fear of understanding

Fear of landing

Thank you, Tess the sweetest Stewardess

The British street beneath my feet

I speed through London on the subway

Northern line to Bolder’s Green

To get my amp and my lava lamp

Then, I catch a train to Glasgow



Fear of flying

Fear of schlepping

Fear of stepping

Fear of smiling

Fear of changing

Fear of rearranging

Fear of stopping

Fear of shopping

Fear of dropping dead

Dead in a room

Unidentified

Undiscovered

Covered

Up and take it away



I’m never gonna leave this room again

I’m never gonna leave this room again

Never gonna leave this room again

Never gonna leave this room again
