Happiness


Monica:

Saturday, I get a call from Mommy

Saturday, I get a call from Mommy to say Daddy’s run away

Run away with who’

Judy Katz, Mom’s best friend.



Sunday night, I get a call from Daddy

Sunday night, I get a call from Daddy and he’s laying in bed with you-know-who

I said, ‘Talk to me, Dad.’ And he did.



He said, ‘Kid, I don’t know how it happened

I never meant it, too, not for a second,

And I didn’t mean to hurt you, oh

It’s out of my control, I’ve never been in love

And when I’m not with her, I’m drowning

Drowning, can you forgive me, darling daughter?

Can you forgive my happiness?



Yes, of course, love happens

I think it just happened to me

I was running, dreaming rainbows

When unexpectedly, I met someone who

Touched me somewhere through

And when I’m not with him I’m cracking

Cracking



Never been in love

Never been in love

Never, never, never, never been in love before

Oh

Never been a love

Don’t  know how to deal with love

Hope it doesn’t happen to me anymore



You can bust down any wall

But you can never have it all

When I’m not with him I’m drowning

I thought it was fear, but now it’s hiding

Slipping, sliding

Happiness



Ian:

Telephone rings, how are you, brother?

Our mother just dropped dead on the golf course

She just shot a birdie, so

She died with a smile on her face



Ali made arrangements, I took the pain

Hard British nights, cold in the rain

Never gonna see my Mommy again



Monica:

Dear Wanker,

Woke up this morning

I had to write to you

What’s the point in wondering?



Both:

What’s new?



Monica:

Whatcha doing?



Ian:

Whatcha doing?



Monica:

Where ya going?



Ian:

Where ya going?



Monica:

Are you happy?

Who’re you happy with?



Ian:

Am I happy’



Monica:

Are you thinking?

Are you singing?

How’s the drinking?

That’s all

Ian, I really need to speak to you.

Give me a call



Ian:

Why have a little when a lot will do so much better?

Why have a bittle when a bottle will be wetter?

There’s the riddle

Why, the kittle go full throttle

Till the final empty bottle

What an awful, tragic sight.

Another lost cause

Just like my Daddy was



Monica:

Come out of the darkness

Into the light

Come out of the darkness

Into the light



Both:

Come out of the darkness

Into the light
