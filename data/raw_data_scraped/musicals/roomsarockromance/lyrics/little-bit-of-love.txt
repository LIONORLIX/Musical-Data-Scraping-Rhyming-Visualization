Little Bit Of Love


Monica:

Percy says if I don’t drop you, he’ll drop me.

He wants to book me some shows with musicians who will actually show up.



Ian:

How deliciously delightful for you. And what do you say?



Monica:

I said I couldn’t make it with someone I can’t count on.



Ian:

What about us’



Monica:

The point is you’re getting in my way

You’re holding me back, and there’s just no way

I’m gonna have that

Look at yourself

You’re drunk out of your skull most of the time

Well, that’s a bad mishap

But I will not bow down to your crap

Let’s leave with a little bit of love



Ian:

I don’t appreciate the fact

That you can’t just sit still in a room

It’s pathetic

You got too many ants in your pants

All caught up in the romance of the big break

Christ sake!

Settle down, desperation, Monica

Every day a little death, take yourself a little breath

Breathe yourself a little bit of love



Monica:

Leave with a little bit of love



Ian:

Can we just sit and relax for a minute?

Just talk things through



Monica:

I appreciate the fact

You want to talk things through like

Mature, grown-up people



Ian:

I appreciate the fact we like and prize each other



Monica:

But soon we might despise each other

Let’s leave with a little bit



Ian:

Of anger, though I must admit

You drag me ‘round the world to say, ‘That’s it’

I quit, wrong fit,’ well shit, I’m so na’ve

That’ll teach me not to wear my poor heart on my sleeve



Monica:

Let’s leave with a little bit of



Ian:

Look on your table, Monica!

Half-finished lyrics, incomplete rhymes

Daddy’s Girl, Monica, unable in life, unable in art,

To finish what you start



Monica:

I’m late.



Ian:

Oh, God, for what this time’



Monica:

Late!

Pregnant

I think I might be eating for two

Bun in the oven

Pregnant



Ian:

Pregnant’



Monica:

I went to the chemist and I bought a little test

And now I have to pee and then let science do the rest

To see if I’m’



Ian:

Pregnant

Reeling room, feeling numb

Helpless, hopeless to the outcome



Monica:

There’s no way I’m gonna have this baby

There is not an even maybe

Not as long as I want to be a star

I’m not ready now nor ever

To be pregnant

You know, for a musician, your rhythm method is rubbish!



Ian:

Maybe we should have it, or something.



Monica:

Are you out of your mind or something?

Look at your table, acres of bottles!

A slave to the alcohol, you’ll always be or might have been,

Unless you go get clean



Ian:

It’s my baby, too!



Monica:

I’ve made my decision!



Ian:

Then, I’ve made mine.



Ian (Overlapping):

I’m going back to Glasgow

I miss the gray days

George Square at dark, the Celtic Park

I’ll build my studio

Glasgow

Home



Monica (Overlapping):

I’ll keep Manhattan

My ballroom gown

The perfect town if you are up for getting down

I’ll live the universe of Manhattan

Home



Ian:

Are you sure you don’t want me to go to the clinic with you before I go?



Monica:

Positive.



Ian:

Yeah, you are, aren’t you

Let’s leave with a little bit of’



Monica:

Little bit of



Ian:

Little bit of love.

Bye, Mon.



Monica:

Don’t call me Mon.

Pacing in a room

Pacing in my heart again

Just get up and start again

Monica, pace the room

Bring the future faster

Might just be a whim

But maybe I can go faster without him

Va-voom, I gotta get out this room
