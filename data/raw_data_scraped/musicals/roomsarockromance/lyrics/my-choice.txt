My Choice


Monica:

This is excruciating, somewhat humiliating

Waiting here, no place to run

Doing the deed that must be done

And I still got dreams to settle

Call me an unblossomed petal

Flowering into something wild

I can?t be a mother while I?m still a child

I wanna be free



And there?s two dozen women waiting in line

All with the same problem as mine

Places to go, people to see

Things to do, things to be

Twenty-four women, just like me

Singing along in harmony

It?s my baby, my body

My choice



On the slab, I lie, I part my legs

I start to cry, they start to press

I think of Mommy beautiful in her Friday night dress

Groggy anesthesia, foggy with amnesia

There?s everything I ever thought I wanted

Disappears



And I leap of the slab

And I run out the room

And in my womb

Baby boom



It starts to rain, I go get the train

With my baby, in my body

My choice

Done

We have a son

His name is Glasgow

Two years old

Good as gold

Glasgow Miller Wallace



He?s got a little bed, he?s got a lava lamp

He?s got a wee guitar and an even wee-er amplifier

Why, you should hear him sing

It?s what he loves to do

And cause he does, he lives in us

And he has kept me close to you



Say something

Anything at all



Ian:

Talk about dumbstruck

Me, a father, good luck

Always could rely on her

To bring me news that rendered me

Unstuck, unglued

Undone

I have got a son

That requires some contemplation

What do I do with this information?



Late nights in my studio

Playing with sound and sonic vision

Plugging into the rhythm of dissidence I felt inside

Each minor chord and major test

A back beat playing in my chest

Your smile, your face, the bass, the boom

The empty space I call my room



But I was always one step off my best

When I was without you

I was always one step to the left

Within me without you



Monica:

No more loneliness



Ian:

Within me without you



Monica:

No more sorrow



Ian:

Within me without you



Both:

No more second guessing

No more wondering what if we had done things

Differently
