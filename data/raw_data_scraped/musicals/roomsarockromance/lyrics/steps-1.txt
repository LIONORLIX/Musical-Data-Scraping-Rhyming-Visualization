Steps 1


Monica:

I took a ride to the working class side of the city,

Way down Sauchiehall Street, I drove in my little blue car

I found the address of a tenement,

Paid a wee boy a pound to hang around watching my little blue car



I took tentative steps

I?d never taken such tentative steps before

I remember your mother answering the door

And she said "Och! You must be Monica! Oh, you?re a lovely wee lassie.

Ali said you were coming over. Well come on in hen, have a wee cup of tea!

I?m just watching the golf on my colour TV.

That Jack Nicklaus is so cute, so he is!

If I had some clubs, I?d go to the local course right now and play a wee 18 holes!

Well, I can dream, can?t I darlin?. Alright, Ian?s in there.

I can?t believe ol? misery guts is letting you into his room.

Nobody gets in there, not even his brother, Ali- and it?s his room too.

All he does is sit in his room, day after day, playing his axe

He never goes out anymore

In you go then, hen."



I took tentative steps

I?d never taken such tentative steps before

As I knocked on your black painted door
