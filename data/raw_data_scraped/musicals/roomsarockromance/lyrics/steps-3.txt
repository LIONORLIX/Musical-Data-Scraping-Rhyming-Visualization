Steps 3


Monica:

It was after you left, a Friday.



I took a ride to the Lower East Side of this city

A big yellow taxi down to Delancier Drive

I found the address of a clinic, cynically bit my tongue

With this feeling of yearning was not what I planned



I took tentative steps

I never taken such tentative steps before

I remember that nurse answering the door



Her name tag said Abigail. She showed me into a cold white room with a handshake smile.

"Take off your clothes" she said. Put on this robe, pee in this cup,

fill out this form. Make yourself comfortable.
