Rooms


Ian:

Sitting in a room, waiting here for you nothing ever changes



Monica:

Sitting in a room, feeling all this gloom, hyping all this squages



Both:

Suddenly you’re here beside me



Monica:

Haven’t seen you in 3 years



Ian:

2 and ‘ but who the hell is counting



Monica:

Feel the tension mounting



Ian:

You’re not throwing up in there’



Monica:

No, I don’t do that anymore



Ian:

So glad it’s true



Monica:

It’s mad to see you



Both:

Suddenly you’re here beside me

Sitting in a room



Monica:

I had this dream that I’m locked in a room

And I can’t get out, I can’t get out



Ian:

I have this dream I’m locked out a room

And I can’t get in



Monica:

And I can’t get out



Ian:

And I can’t get in



Monica:

I can’t get out



Ian:

Sitting in a room, waiting here for you, nothing ever changes



Monica:

Images of you, images of us

Rooms to grow, rooms to breathe in



Both:

Suddenly, you’re here beside me

Same old to and fro

Like our first hello

All those rooms a-glow
