Bring The Future Faster


Monica:

It was hard to stay collected

He was so much better than expected

And it might just be a whim

But I think I could go faster with him



Every night I'm pacing in my moon-stroom room

And I think we can all presume

I'm pacing to the pulsing of my heart convulsing



Buzz! Bang! Crash! Wizzle-sizzle!

onomatopoeias all around me

Slum-pup, can't stop my head exploding

I am seriously overloading



Bring the future faster

Bring the future faster



Deep in the dark of the heart of the night

My head is racing, pacing, a nerve and speaking

Relatively speaking

Don't know what I feel, but I know it's real



I'm wearing a hole in the floor

So open up the door and let me out this room

And soon

And soon



Bring the future faster

Bring the future faster



Give me the new thing

The next thing

That's always the best thing

A new view

I have to breakthrough

To something new

To something new

The universe is spinning

With another new beginning



Bring the future faster

Would you bring the future faster

All I want is everything

All I want is me
