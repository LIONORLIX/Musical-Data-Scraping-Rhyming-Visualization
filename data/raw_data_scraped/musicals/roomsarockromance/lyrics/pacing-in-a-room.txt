Pacing In A Room


Monica:

Pacing in a room, can’t believe he’s late

Look at me already, I’m in a terrible state



Ian:

Monica:

Oh, God, you’re pissed!



Ian:

All I had was a vodka whiz

A whiskey sour and a Slogen fizz



Monica:

Jesus Christ, you’re mental



Ian:

I can’t say Jesus Christ in a temple
