Politics And Poker


"Whaddya say, Ben? Want a hand?"

"Nah, you guys go ahead. I got too much on my mind to play poker"

King bets" "Cost you five" "Tony, up to you"

"I'm in" "So am I" "Likewise" "Me, too"



Gentlemen, here we are, and one thing is clear

We gotta pick a candidate for Congress this year



"Big ace" "Ace bets" "You'll pay through the nose"

"I'm in" "So am I" "Likewise" "Here goes"

"Possible straight" "Possible flush" "Nothing"



Gentlemen, how about some names we can use

Some qualified Republican who's willing to lose

How's about we should make Jack Riley the guy ?

Which Riley are you thinkin' of - Jack P. or Jack Y?



I say, "Neither one - I never even met 'em"

I say, "When you got a pair of Jacks, bet 'em!"



Politics and poker, politics and poker

Shuffle up the cards and find the joker

Neither game's for children; either game is rough

Decisions, decisions, like

Who to pick, how to play, what to bet, when to call a bluff



"All right, now, fellas, politics or poker -- which is more important?"

"Pair of treys" "Bet 'em" "Little treys -- good as gold"

"I'll stay" "Raise you five" "I'll call" "I'll fold"

"Raise you back" "I think you're bluffing" "Put your money where your mouth is"



Gentlemen, knock it off, and let's get this done

Try Michael Payeshenckovich -- I'm certain he'd run

Mike is out -- I'm afraid he just wouldn't sell

Nobody likes a candidate whose name they can't spell



How 'bout Dave Zimmerman?

Davie's too bright

What about Walt Gustafson?

Walt died last night



How about Frank Monahan?

What about George Gale?

Frank ain't a citizen and George is in jail



We could run Al Wollenstein

He's only twenty-three

What about Ed Peterson?

You idiot, that's me!



Politics and poker, politics and poker

Playing for a pot that's mediocre

Politics and poker, running neck and neck

If politics seems more predictable

That's because usually you can stack the deck!



Politics and poker, politics and poker

Makes the average guy a heavy a smoker

Bless the nominee and give him our regards

And watch while he learns that in poker and politics

Brother, you've gotta have that slippery haphazardous commodity

You've gotta have the cards!
