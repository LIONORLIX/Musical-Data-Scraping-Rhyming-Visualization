I Love A Cop


"Oh, gosh, life is so complicated"

I love a cop

I love a cop



What a situation! Ain't it awful?

Life is really grim

I can only say that it's unlawful

How I feel towards him!



I love a cop

I love a cop



If I introduce him as my steady

Down at where I work

I can hear the rumors spread already

"Dora's gone berserk"



Then there's Thea -- Oh, how gruesome

Can you see me introduce him?

"You remember her -- she detested you"

"You remember him -- he arrested you"



I'm so confused

I'm so confused

If I loved a dentist or a doctor

I'd be up on top

But I love a cop



I love a cop

I love a cop



Though it wasn't easy to accept him

Now I think he's sweet

You should hear him tell the way I swept him

Off his big flat feet



I love a cop

I love a cop



I can see his drawbacks clear as crystal

Still, I testify

Once you take away his club and pistol

Floyd won't hurt a fly



Floyd's ambitious and he's forceful

Energetic and resourceful

I can see how far this will carry him

If he'd get an honest job, I would marry him



That's how it is

He's mine; I'm his

Little did I know when Floyd first kissed me

And I whispered, "Stop"

You can't stop a cop
