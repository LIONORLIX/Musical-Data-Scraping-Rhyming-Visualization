Unfair


Management's unfair!

Management's unfair!

Management is terribly unfair!

(Girls! Girls! That's not the way to win!)

You'd think that a human heart would break

At such a display as this!

But warm-hearted men, with money at stake

can turn into heartless misbegotten misers

Now a strike isn’t played like tic-tac-toe

and soft-spoken tactics just don’t go!

Ladies, you’ve got no choice!

You’ve got to holler and howl in a most unladylike voice!

(Unfair! Unfair!)

(Again! Unfair! Unfair! Louder! Unfair! Good!)

Let's put a stop to the sweatshop!

That's the disease we want to cure!

Proudly we picket

The punks who pick the pockets

Of the poor hard-working poor!

While we stitch-stitch-stitch

Someone's getting rich

By the sweat of his sister's brow!

Let's fix the wagon

of this gold-hungry dragon!

Let's trim the fat from this...sacred cow!

You've got to howl at the top of your voice!

Holler and howl at the top of your voice!

Keep yelling "foul" at the top of your voice!

Unfair!

Let's put a stop to the sweatshop! (Good!)

Let's end the evil of the age! (That's it!)

Fight to the finish

to win the war we're waging

For a decent... LIVING... WAGE! (Right!)

Must we sew and sew solely to survive

So some low so-and-so can thrive?

No! He'll fry in Hades if it's up to the ladies

Waistmakers Union Local 25!

UNFAIR!
