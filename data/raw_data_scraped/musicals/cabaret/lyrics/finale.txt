Finale


CLIFF:

Willkommen, bienvenue, welcome,

Fremde, etranger, stranger.



CLIFF and EMCEE:

Glucklich zu sehen,

Je suis enchante,

Happy to see you.





EMCEE:

Bleibe, reste, stay,

Willkommen, bienvenue, welcome,

Im cabaret, au cabaret, to cabaret!



Meine Damen und Herren?Mesdames et Messieurs?Ladies and Gentlemen.

Where are your troubles now? Forgotten? I told you so! We have no troubles here.

Here life is beautiful?the girls are beautiful?even the orchestra is beautiful.



SCHULTZ: Just children. Mischievous children on their way to school. You

understand.



FRAULEIN SCHNEIDER: I understand. One does what one must.



SALLY: It'll all work out. It's only politics, and what's that got to do with

us?



FRAULEIN SCHNEIDER: I must be sensible. If the Nazis come- what other choice

have I?



SCHULTZ: I know I am right?because I understand the Germans. After all, what

am I? A German.



SALLY:

I made my mind up back in Chelsea.

When I go I'm going like Elsie.



... from cradle to tomb

Isn't that long a stay.

Life is a cabaret, old chum,

Life is a cabaret, old chum,

Life is a cabaret.



EMCEE:

Auf wiedersehen!

A bientot!

Good night?
