[Spoken]

Meine Damen und Herren, Mesdames et Messieurs,

Ladies and Gentlemen! Guden Abend, bon soir,

We geht's? Comment ca va? Do you feel good?

I bet you do!

Ich bin euer Confrecier; je suis votre compere...

I am you host!



Und sagen

Willkommen, bienvenue, welcome

Im Cabaret, au Cabaret, to Cabaret



[spoken]

Leave you troubles outside!

So - life is disappointing? Forget it!

We have no troubles here! Here life is beautiful...

The girls are beautiful...

Even the orchestra is beautiful!



You see? I told your the orchestra is beautiful!



And now presenting the Cabaret Girls!

Rosie! (Rosie is so called because of the color of her

cheeks.) Lulu! (Oh, you like Lulu? Well, too bad!

So does Rosie.) Frenchie! (You know I like to order Frenchie

on the side. On your side Frenchie! Just kidding!)

Texas! (Yes, Texas is from America!But she's a very

cunning linguist!) Fritzie!

(Oh, Fritzie, please, will you stop that!

Already this week we have lost two waiters,

a table and three bottles of champagne up there.)

and Helga! (Helga is the baby. I'm just like a father

to her. So when she's bad, I spank her. And she's

very, very, very, very, very bad.)



Rosie, Lulu, Frenchie, Texas, Fritzie... Und Helga.

Each and every one a virgin! You don't believe me?

Well, don't take my word for it. Go ahead- try Helga!



Outside it is winter. But in here it's so hot.

Every night we have to battle with the girls to keep

them from taking off all their clothings. So don't go

away. Who knows? Tonight we may lose the battle!
