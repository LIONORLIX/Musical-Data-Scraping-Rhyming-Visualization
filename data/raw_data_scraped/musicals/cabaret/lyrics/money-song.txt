Money Song


[EMCEE]

Money makes the world go around

The world go around

The world go around

Money makes the world go around

It makes the world go 'round.



A mark, a yen, a buck, or a pound

A buck or a pound

A buck or a pound

Is all that makes the world go around,

That clinking clanking sound

Can make the world go 'round.



[GIRLS]

Money money money money money money

Money money money money money money

[EMCEE]

If you happen

To be rich,

[GIRLS]

Night's enetertainment,

You can pay for a

Gay escapade.

A-ling for the maid.

[EMCEE]

If you happen

To be rich

[GIRLS]

Left by your lover,

Though you moan

And you groan

Quite a lot,

You can take it

On the chin,

Call a cab,

And begin

To recover

On your fourteen-

Carat yacht.



[EMCEE]

Money makes the world go around,

The world go around,

The world go around,

Money makes the world go around,

Of that we can be sure.

(....) on being poor.

Money money money money money money

Money money money money money money

Money money money money money money



[DANCE BREAK]



[EMCEE AND GIRLS (In Canon)]

If you haven't any coal in the stove

And you freeze in the winter

And you curse on the wind

At your fate

When you haven't any shoes

On your feet

And your coat's thin as paper

And you look thirty pounds

Underweight.

When you go to get a word of advice

From the fat little pastor

He will tell you to love evermore.

But when hunger comes a rap,

Rat-a-tat, rat-a-tat at the window...



[GIRLS]

At the window...



[EMCEE (spoken)]

Who's there?



[GIRLS (spoken)]

Hunger!



[EMCEE (Spoken)]

Ooh, hunger!



See how love flies out the door...

For

Clanking sound of
