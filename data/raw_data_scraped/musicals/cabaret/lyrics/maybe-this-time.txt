Maybe this Time


[SALLY]

Maybe this time, I'll be lucky

Maybe this time, he'll stay

Maybe this time

For the first time

Love won't hurry away



He will hold me fast

I'll be home at last

Not a loser anymore

Like the last time

And the time before



Everybody loves a winner

So nobody loved me;

'Lady Peaceful,' 'Lady Happy,'

That's what I long to be

All the odds are in my favor

Something's bound to begin

It's got to happen, happen sometime

Maybe this time I'll win
