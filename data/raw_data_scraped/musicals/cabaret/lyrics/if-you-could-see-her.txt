If You Could See Her


EMCEE:

I know what you're thinking?

You wonder why I chose her

Out of all the ladies in the world.

That's just a first impression?

What good's a first impression?

If you knew her like I do,

It would change your point of view.



If you could see her through my eyes,

You wouldn't wonder at all.

If you could see her through my eyes,

I guarantee you would fall like I did.



When we're in public together,

I hear society groan.

But if they could see her through my eyes,

Maybe they'd leave us alone.



How can I speak of her virtues?

I don't know where to begin:

She's clever, she's smart, she reads music,

She doesn't smoke or drink gin like I do.



Yet when we're walking together,

They sneer if I'm holding her hand.

But if they could see her through my eyes,

Maybe they'd all understand.



(They waltz)



I understand your objection,

I grant you the problem's not small.

But if you could see her through my eyes,

She wouldn't look Jewish at all!
