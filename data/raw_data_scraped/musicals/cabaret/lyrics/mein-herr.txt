Mein Herr


[EMCEE]

Meine Damen und Herren. Mesdames et Messieurs,

Ladies and Gentlemen; it is almost midnight!

Husbands- you have only ten seconds in which to

lose your wives!  Five- four- three- two- one!

Happy New Year!



[SALLY]

You have to understand the way I am,

Mein Herr.

A tiger is a tiger, not a lamb.

Mein Herr.

You'll never turn the vinegar to jam,

Mein Herr.

So I do...

What I do...

When I'm through...

Then I'm through...

And I'm through...

Toodle-oo!

Bye-Bye, Mein Lieber Herr.

Farewell, mein Lieber Herr.

It was a fine affair,

But now it's over.

And though I used to care,

I need the open air.

You're better off without me,

Mein Herr.



Don't dab your eye, mein Herr,

Or wonder why, Mein Herr.

I've always told you I was a rover.

You mustn't knit your brow,

You should have known by now

You'd every cause to doubt me,

Mein, Herr.



The continent of Europe is so wide,

Mein Herr.

Not only up and down, but side to side,

Mein Herr.

I couldn't ever cross it if I tried,

Mein Herr.

So I do..

What I can...

Inch by inch...

Step by step...

Mile by mile...

Man by man.



Bye-Bye, Mein Lieber Herr.

Farewell, mein Lieber Herr.

It was a fine affair,

But now it's over.

And though I used to care,

I need the open air.

You're better off without me,

Mein Herr.



[SALLY AND GIRLS]

Don't dab your eye, mein Herr,

Or wonder why, Mein Herr.

I've always told you I was a rover.

You mustn't knit your brow,

You should have known by now

You'd every cause to doubt me,

Mein, Herr.



Bye-bye, mein Lieber Herr,

Auf wiedersehen, mein Herr.

Es war sehr gut, mein Herr

Und vorbei.

Du kennst mich wohl, mein Herr,

Ach, lebe wohl, mein Herr.

Du sollst mich nicht mehr sehen,

Mein Herr.

Du kennst mich,

Wohl, mein

Mein Herr...

[GIRLS]

Ach, lebe

Wohl, mein

Herr.

Du sollst mich

Nicht mehr

Sehen,

[SALLY]

And bye-bye



[SALLY AND GIRLS]

Bye-Bye, Mein Lieber Herr;

Farewell, mein Lieber Herr.

It was a fine affair,

But now it's over.

And though I-

Used to care,

I need the-

Open air.

You're better off

Without me,
