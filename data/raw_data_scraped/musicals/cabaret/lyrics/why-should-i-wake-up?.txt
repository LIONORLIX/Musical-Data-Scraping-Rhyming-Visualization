Why Should I Wake Up?


Why should I wake up?

This dream is going so well.

When you're enchanted,

Why break the spell?

Drifting in this euphoric state,

Morning can wait.

Let it come late.

Why should I wake up?

Why waste a drop of the wine?

Don't I adore you?

And aren't you mine?

Maybe I'll someday be lonely again.

But why should I wake up till then?



Drifting in this euphoric state,

Morning can wait.

Let it come late.

Why should I wake up?

Why waste a drop of the wine?

Don't I adore you?

And aren't you mine?

Maybe I'll someday be lonely again.

But why should I wake up,

Why should I wake up till then?
