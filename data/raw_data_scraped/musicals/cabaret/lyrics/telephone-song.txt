Telephone Song


-Hello!

-Hello!

-Sittin' all alone like that

You happen to catch my eye

Would you like to buy a girl a drink?

-Sorry!

-Oh, goodbye!

-Hello!

-Hello!

-Table four is calling table nine, how are you, mister?

-I get fine!

-Sittin' all alone like that

You happen to catch my eye

Would you like to buy a girl a dance?

-Yeah! Wait up!

-Goodbye!

-Hello! -Hello! -Hello! -Hello!

-Table seven calling number three,

How are you, handsome?

-You mean me?

-We can see you, can you see us?

Would you like to have a dance?

The rhythm to the music's hot,

Maybe if we could talk it over here.

-Hot, close, why not?

-Alone, alone,

You shouldn't sit alone like that

Alone, alone,

Alone in a night like this

-Alone, alone,

You shouldn't sit alone like that

Alone, alone,

Alone in a night like this

-Yeah, look!

-Hello! -Hello! -Hello! -Hello! Etc.

-Table seven is calling number nine, how are you?...

-Table eight is calling number two, how are you?...

-Table five is calling number three, how are you?...

-Sittin' all alone like that

You happen to catch my eye

Would you like to buy a girl a drink?

Would you like to buy a man a drink?

Would you like to buy a boy a drink?

Will you?

Why not?

Goodbye!
