My Girl Back Home


My girl back home

I almost forgot

A blue eyed kid

I liked her a lot

We got engaged

both families were glad

and I was told by my uncle and dad

that if I was clever and able

they'd make me a part of a partnership

Cable, Cable

and Cable



How far away?

Philidelphia P.A

Princeton N.J.

How far are they?



From coconut palms

and banyan trees

and coral sands

And Tonkinese



Nellie:

How far are they?

Little Rock A.R.K?



Cable:

Princeton N.J

How far are they?



Nellie:

How far are they?



Nellie and Cable:

From coconut palms

and banyon trees

to coral sands

And Tonkinese
