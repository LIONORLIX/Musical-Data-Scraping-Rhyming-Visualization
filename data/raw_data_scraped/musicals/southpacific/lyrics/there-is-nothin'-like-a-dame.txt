There Is Nothin' like A Dame


Sailors, Seabees and Marines:

We got sunlight on the sand,

We got moonlight on the sea,

We got mangoes and bananas

You can pick right off the tree,

We got volleyball and ping-pong

And a lot of dandy games!

What ain't we got?

We ain't got dames!



We get packages from home,

We get movies, we get shows,

We get speeches from our skipper

And advice from Tokyo Rose,

We get letters doused with perfume

We get dizzy from the smell!

What don't we get?

You know darn well!



We have nothin' to put on a clean white suit for

What we need is what there ain't no substitute for...



There is nothin' like a dame,

Nothin' in the world,

There is nothin' you can name

That is anythin' like a dame!



We feel restless, we feel blue,

We feel lonely and in grief,

We feel ev'ry kind of feelin',

But the feelin' of relief

We feel hungry as the wolf felt

When he met Red Hiding-hood

What don't we feel?

We don't feel good!



Lots of things in life are beautiful, but brother,

There is one particular thing that is nothin' whatsoever

In any way, shape or form like any other.



There is nothin' like a dame,

Nothin' in the world,

There is nothin' you can name

That is anythin' like a dame!



Nothin' else was built the same,

Nothin' in the world

As the soft and wavy frame

Like the silhouette of a dame!



There is absolutely nothin' like a frame of a dame.



So suppose that dame and bride

Are completely free from flaws,

Or as faithful as a bird dog,

Or as kind as Santa Claus,

It's a waste of time to worry

Over things that they have not,

We're thankful for the things they got!



There is nothin' you can name

That is anythin' like a dame!



There are no books like a dame,

And nothin' looks like a dame.

There are no drinks like a dame,

And nothin' thinks like a dame,

Nothin' acts like a dame,

Or attracts like a dame.

There ain't a thing that's wrong with any man here

That can't be cured by pullin' him near

A girly, womanly, female, feminine dame!
