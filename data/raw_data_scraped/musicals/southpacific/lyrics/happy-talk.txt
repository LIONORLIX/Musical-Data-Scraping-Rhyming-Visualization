Happy Talk


Bloody Mary:

Happy talk, keep talkin' happy talk,

Talk about things you'd like to do.

You got to have a dream,

If you don't have a dream,

How you gonna have a dream come true?



Talk about the moon floatin' in the sky

Lookin' at a lily on the lake;

Talk about a bird learnin' how to fly.

Makin' all the music he can make.



Happy talk, keep talkin' happy talk,

Talk about things you'd like to do.

You got to have a dream,

If you don't have a dream,

How you gonna have a dream come true?



Talk about the sparrow lookin' like a toy

Pickin' through the broaches of a tree;

Talk about the girl, talk about the boy

Countin' all the ripples on the sea.



Happy talk, keep talkin' happy talk,

Talk about things you'd like to do.

You got to have a dream,

If you don't have a dream

How you gonna have a dream come true?



Talk about the boy sayin' to the girl:

"Golly, baby, I'm a lucky cuss."

Talk about the girl sayin' to the boy:

"You an' me is lucky to be us!"



Happy talk, keep talkin' happy talk,

Talk about things you'd like to do.

You got to have a dream,

If you don't have a dream

How you gonna have a dream come true?



If you don't talk happy,

And you never have dream,

Then you'll never have a dream come true!



[Spoken]

It's good idea, you like?
