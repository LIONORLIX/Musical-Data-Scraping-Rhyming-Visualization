Younger than Springtime


Cable:

I touch your hands

And my heart goes strong,

Like a pair of birds

That burst with song.

My eyes look down

At your lovely face,

And I hold a world

In my embrace.



Younger than springtime, are you

Softer than starlight, are you,

Warmer than winds of June,

Are the gentle lips you gave me.

Gayer than laughter, are you,

Sweeter than music, are you,

Angel and lover, heaven and earth,

Are you to me.



And when your youth

And joy invade my arms,

And fill my heart as now they do,

Then younger than springtime, am I,

Gayer than laughter, am I,

Angel and lover, heaven and earth,

Am I with you!



And when your youth

And joy invade my arms,

And fill my heart as now they do,



Then younger than springtime, am I,

Gayer than laughter, am I,

Angel and lover, heaven and earth,

Am I with you.
