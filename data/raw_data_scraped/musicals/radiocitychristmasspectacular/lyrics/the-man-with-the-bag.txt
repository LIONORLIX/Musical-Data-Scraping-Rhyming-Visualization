The Man With The Bag


Old mr. Kringle is soon gonna jingle

The bells that’ll tingle all your troubles away

Everybody’s waiting for the man with the bag

‘Cause christmas is coming again



He’s got a sleigh full, it’s not gonna stay full

Stuff that he’s dropping every stop of the way

Everybody’s waiting for the man with the bag

‘Cause christmas is coming again



He’ll be here

With the answer to the prayers

That you made through the year

You’ll get yours

If you’ve done everything you should extra special good

He’ll make this december the one you’ll remember

The best and the merriest you ever did have

Everybody’s waiting for the man with the bag

‘Cause christmas is coming again



Old mr. Kringle is soon gonna jingle

All the bells that’ll tingle all your troubles away

Everybody’s waiting for the man with the bag

‘Cause christmas is here again



He’s got a sleigh full, and it’s not gonna stay full

Got stuff that he’s dropping every stop of the way

Everybody’s waiting for the man with the bag

‘Cause christmas is here again



He’ll be here

With the answer to the prayers

That you made through the year

You’ll get yours

If you’ve done everything you should extra special good

He’ll make this december the one you’ll remember

The best and the merriest you ever did have

Everybody’s waiting, they’re all congregating

Waiting for the man with the bag



Better watch out now!
