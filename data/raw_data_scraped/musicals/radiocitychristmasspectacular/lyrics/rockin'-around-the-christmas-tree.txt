Rockin' Around The Christmas Tree


Rocking around the christmas tree

At the christmas party hop

Mistletoe hung where you can see

Ev'ry couple tries to stop



Rocking around the christmas tree

Let the christmas spirit ring

Later we'll have some pumpkin pie

And we'll do some caroling



You will get a sentimental feeling when you hear voices singing

"let's be jolly; deck the halls with boughs of holly" rocking around the christmas tree

Have a happy holiday

Everyone's dancing merrily

In a new old fashioned way



Rocking around the christmas tree

And we'll do some caroling



You will get a sentimental feeling when you hear voices singing

"let's be jolly; deck the halls with boughs of holly"

Rocking around the christmas tree

Have a happy holiday

Everyone's dancing merrily

In a new old fashioned way
