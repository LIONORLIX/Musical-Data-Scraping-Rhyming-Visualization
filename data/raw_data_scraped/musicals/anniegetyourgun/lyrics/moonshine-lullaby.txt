Moonshine Lullaby


Annie:

Behind the hill

There's a busy little still

Where your Pappy's workin' in the moonlight



Your lovin' paw

Isn't quite within the law

So he's hidin' there behind the hill



Bye bye baby

Stop your yawnin'

Don't cry baby

Day will be dawning



And when it does

From the mountain where he wuz

He'll be coming with jug of moonshine



So count your sheep

Mama's singing you to sleep

With the Moonshine Lullaby



Trio:

Loo Loo



Behind the hill

There's a busy little still

Where your Pappy's workin' in the moonlight



Your lovin' paw

Isn't quite within the law

So he's hidin' there behind the hill



Annie and Trio:

Bye bye baby

Stop your yawnin'

Don't cry baby

Day will be dawning



Trio:

And when it does

>From the mountain where he wuz

He'll be coming with jug of moonshine



Annie:

So count your sheep

Mama's singing you to sleep

With the Moonshine Lullaby



Kids:

Dream of Pappy

Very happy

With his jug of mountain rye



Annie:

So count your sheep

Mama's singing you to sleep

With the Moonshine Lullaby
