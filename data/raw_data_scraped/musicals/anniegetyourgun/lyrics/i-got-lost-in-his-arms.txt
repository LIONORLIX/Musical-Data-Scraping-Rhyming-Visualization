I Got Lost in His Arms


ANNIE OAKLEY:

Don't ask me just how it happens,

I wish I knew.

I can't believe that it's happened,

And still it's true.



I got lost in his arms

And I had to stay;

It was dark in his arms

And I lost my way.

From the dark came a voice

And it seemed to say,

There you go,

There you go.



How I felt as I fell

I just can't recall.

But his arms held me fast

And it broke the fall.

And I said to my heart,

As it foolishly kept jumping

All around,

I got lost,

But look what I've found.



CHORUS:

There you go

There you go



ANNIE OAKLEY:

How I felt as I fell

I just can't recall.

But his arms held me fast

As it broke the fall.

And I said to my heart,

As it foolishly kept jumping

All around,

I got lost,

But look what I've found.
