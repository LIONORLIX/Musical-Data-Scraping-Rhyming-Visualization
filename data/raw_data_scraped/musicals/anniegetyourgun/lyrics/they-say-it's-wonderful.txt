They Say It's Wonderful


ANNIE OAKLEY:

They say that falling in love is wonderful

It's wonderful, so they say.

And with a moon up above it's wonderful

It's wonderful, so they tell me.

I can't recall who said it

I know I never read it

I only know that falling in love is grand

And the thing that's known as romance

Is wonderful, wonderful

In every way

So they say



FRANK BUTLER:

Rumors fly and they often leave without

But you've come to the right place to find out

Ev'rything that you've heard is really so

I've been there once or twice and I should know

You'll find that falling in love is wonderful

It's wonderful, as they say

And with a moon up above it's wonderful

It's wonderful, as they tell you

You'll leave your house a morning

And without any warning

You're stopping people shouting that love is grand

And to hold a man in your arms

Is wonderful, wonderful

In every way



ANNIE OAKLEY:

I should say.

FRANK BUTLER:

Wonderful...



ANNIE OAKLEY:

Wonderful...



ANNIE OAKLEY and FRANK BUTLER:

In every way

So they say.
