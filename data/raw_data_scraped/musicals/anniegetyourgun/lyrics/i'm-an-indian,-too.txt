I'm an Indian, Too


ANNIE OAKLEY and INDIAN CHORUS:

Ook-a-looka

Gah-hay-la-kinka

La-ha-hoo-way

Hoo-way



ANNIE:

Like the Chippewa,

Iroquois,

Omaha...

Like those Indians

I'm an Indian too

A Sioux

A Sioux



Just like Rising Moon

Falling Pants

Running Nose

Like those Indians

I'm an Indian too

A Sioux

A Sioux



Some Indian drummers they're without a care

I may run away

With Big Chief Sun-of-A-Bear



And I'll have totem poles

Tomahawk

Small papoose

Which will go to prove

I'm an Indian too

A sioux

A sioux

A sioux

Oh, I'm an indian

I'm an Indian

I'm an honest Injun Indian

I'm an Indian, too.
