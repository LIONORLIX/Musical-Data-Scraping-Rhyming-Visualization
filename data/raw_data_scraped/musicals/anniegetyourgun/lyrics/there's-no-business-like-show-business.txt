There's No Business Like Show Business


MEN'S CHORUS:

The costumes, the scenery, the makeup, the props

The audience that lifts you when you're down



WOMEN'S CHORUS:

The headaches, the heartaches, the backaches, the flops

The sheriff who escorts you out of town



MEN'S CHORUS:

The opening when your heart beats like a drum



WOMEN'S CHORUS:

The closing when the customers won't come



ALLS:

There's no business like show business

Like no business I know



MEN'S CHORUS:

Everything about it is appealing



WOMEN'S CHORUS:

Everything the traffic will allow



MEN'S CHORUS:

No where could you have that happy feeling



ALLL:

When you aren't stealing that extra bow

There's no people like show people

They smile when they are low



MEN'S CHORUS:

Yesterday they told you you would not go far



WOMEN'S CHORUS:

That night you opened and there you are



MEN'S CHORUS:

Next day on your dressing room they've hung a star



ALL:

Let's go on with the show



MEN'S CHORUS:

The cowboys, the wrestlers, the tumblers, the clowns

The roustabouts that move the show at dawn



WOMEN'S CHORUS:

The music, the spotlights, the people, the towns

Your baggage with the labels pasted on



MEN'S CHORUS:

The sawdust and the horses and the smell



WOMEN'S CHORUS:

The towel you've taken from the last hotel



ALL:

There's no business like show business

If you tell me it's so

Traveling through the country is so thrilling

Standing out in front on opening nights

Smiling as you watch the benches filling

And see your billing up there in lights



There's no people like show people

They smile when they are low

Even with a turkey that you know will fold

You may be stranded out in the cold

Still you wouldn't trade it for a sack o' gold

Let's go on with the show

Let's go on with the show!

The show!

The show!
