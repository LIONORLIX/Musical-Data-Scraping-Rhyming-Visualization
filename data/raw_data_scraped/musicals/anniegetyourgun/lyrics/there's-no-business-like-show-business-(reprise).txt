There's No Business Like Show Business (Reprise)


MEN'S CHORUS:

The cowboys, the wrestlers, the tumblers, the clowns

The roustabouts that move the show at dawn



WOMEN'S CHORUS:

The music, the spotlights, the people, the towns

Your baggage with the labels pasted on



MEN'S CHORUS:

The sawdust and the horses and the smell



WOMEN'S CHORUS:

The towel you've taken from the last hotel



ALL:

There's no business like show business

If you tell me it's so

Traveling through the country is so thrilling

Standing out in front on opening nights

Smiling as you watch the benches filling

And see your billing up there in lights



There's no people like show people

They smile when they are low

Even with a turkey that you know will fold

You may be stranded out in the cold

Still you wouldn't trade it for a sack o' gold

Let's go on with the show

Let's go on with the show!

The show!

The show!
