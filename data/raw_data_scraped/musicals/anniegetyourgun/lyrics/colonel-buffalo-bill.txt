Colonel Buffalo Bill


(Davenport)

Who's got the stuff that made the Wild West wild?

Who pleases every woman, man, and child?

Who does his best to give the customers a thrill?



(Company)

Who?



(Davenport)

Colonel Buffalo Bill!

Who's got the show that gets the most applause?

Five-hundred Indians and fifty Squas!

Ten featured acts and there's a special feature still?



(Company)

Who?



(Davenport)

Colonel Buffalo Bill!



(Dolly)

Have you ever seen a cowboy rope a steer?



(Company)

No, we haven't



(Dolly)

Or an Indian with feathers throw a spear?



(Company)

No, we haven't



(Dolly)

Have you ever seen a hold up?



(Company)

No sir



(Dolly)

Then gather closer

and let me give you some of the atmosphere



(Davenport, spoken)

Introducing the world's greatest sharpshooter, Mister! Frank! Butler!



(Butler, singing)

The hour is midnight and all is still

We see the stage coach climbing up the hill,

Moving along the mountain trail, carrying passengers and mail,

never suspecting there is something really wrong

The watchful driver is in his seat,

His trusty rifle lying at his feet

Some of the passengers inside

seem to be dozing as they ride,

never suspecting danger as they roll along

Suddenly there's a shout!



(Company)

What is it all about?



(Butler)

"What is it all about?" you ask

It's Indians!



(Company)

Indians?!



(Butler)

Very notable, cut-your-throatable Indians!



(Company)

Indians?!



(Butler, Dolly, and Davenport)

Just when they've taken everyone by force,

Who makes an entrance on a big, white horse?

Who starts a-shootin' 'till there's noone left to kill?



(Company)

General Grant?



(Butler, Dolly, and Davenport)

No! Colonel Buffalo Bill!



(All)

Who's got the show that made the Wild West wild?

Who pleases every woman, man, and child?

Who does his best to give the customers a thrill?

Colonel! Buffalo! Bill!
