My Defenses Are Down


FRANK BUTLER:

I've had my way with so many girls

An' was lots of fun.

My scheme was to know many girls

To keep me safe from one

I find it can be done.

My defenses are down

She's broken my resistance

And I don't know where I am

I went into the fight like a lion

But I came out like a lamb.

My defenses are down

She's got me where she wants me

And I can't escape no how

I could speak to my heart when it wakened

But my heart won't listen now.

Like a toothless, clawless tiger,

Like an organ-grinder's bear,

Like a knight without his armor,

Like Samson without his hair.

My defenses are down

I might as well surrender

For the battle can't be won.

But I must confess that I like it,

So there's nothing to be done.

Yes, I must confess that I like it

Being miserable's gonna be fun



MALE CHORUS:

His defenses are down

She's broken my resistance

And he's in an awful jam.



FRANK BUTLER:

I went into the fight like a lion



MALE CHORUS:

But you came out like a lamb.



FRANK BUTLER:

My defenses are down



MALE CHORUS:

She's got you where she wants you

And you can't escape no how



FRANK BUTLER:

I could speak to my heart when it wakened



MALE CHORUS:

But my heart won't listen now.



FRANK BUTLER:

Like a toothless, clawless tiger,

Like an organ-grinder's bear,

MALE CHORUS:

Like a knight without his armor,



FRANK BUTLER:

Like Samson without his hair.

My defenses are down



FRANK BUTLER and MALE CHORUS:

I might as well surrender

For the battle can't be won.



FRANK BUTLER:

But I must confess that I like it,

So there's nothing to be done.



FRANK BUTLER and MALE CHORUS:

Yes, I must confess that I like it

Being miserable's gonna be fun
