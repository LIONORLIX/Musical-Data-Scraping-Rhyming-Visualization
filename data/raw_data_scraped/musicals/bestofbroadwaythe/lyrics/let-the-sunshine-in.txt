Let The Sunshine In


Soldier 1:

We starve-look

At one another

Short of breath

Walking proudly in our winter coats

Wearing smells from laboratories

Facing a dying nation

Of moving paper fantasy

Listening for the new told lies

With supreme visions of lonely tunes



Soldier 2:

Somewhere

Inside something there is a rush of

Greatness

Who knows what stands in front of

Our lives

I fashion my future on films in space

Silence

Tells me secretly

Everything

Everything



Claude:

Manchester England England

Manchester England England

(Ensemble:Eyes look your last)

Across the Atlantic Sea

(Arms take your last

embrace)

And I'm a genius genius

(And lips oh you the

doors of breath)

I believe in God

(Seal with a righteous kiss)

And I believe that God believes in Claude

(Seal with a righteous kiss)

That's me, that's me, that's me

(The rest is silence,

The rest is silence,

The rest is silence)



Ensemble:

Singing our space songs on a spider web sitar

Life is around you and in you

Answer for Timothy Leary, dearie



Let the sunshine

Let the sunshine in

The sunshine in

Let the sunshine

Let the sunshine in

The sunshine in

Let the sunshine

Let the sunshine in

The sun shine in...
