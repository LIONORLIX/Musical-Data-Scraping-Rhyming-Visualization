Swanee


[Al Jolson]



I've been away from you along time

I never thought I'd miss 'ya so

Somehow I feel, your love is real

Near you I wanna be.



The Birds are singing it is songtime

The banjos strumming soft and low

I know that you yearn for me to swanee you're calling me



Chorus

Swanee - how I love ya, how I love ya

My dear old swanee.

I'd give the world to be among the folks in D-I-X-I-E-ven though my mammy's waiting for me,

praying for me down by the swanne.

The folks up north will see me no more when I get to that swanee shore



(he whistles like a bird)



I love the old folks at home

Swanee - how I love ya, how I love ya

My dear old swanee. I'd give the world to be among the

folks in D-I-X-I-E-ven though my mammy's waiting for

me, praying for me down by the swanee.

The folks up north will see me no more when I get to that swanee shore.
