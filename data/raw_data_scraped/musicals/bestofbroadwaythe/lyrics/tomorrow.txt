Tomorrow


[Musical "Annie"]



[ANNIE]

The sun'll come out

Tomorrow

Bet your bottom dollar

That tomorrow

There'll be sun!



Just thinkin' about

Tomorrow

Clears away the cobwebs,

And the sorrow

'Til there's none!



When I'm stuck a day

That's gray,

And lonely,

I just stick out my chin

And Grin,

And Say,

Oh!



The sun'll come out

Tomorrow

So ya gotta hang on

'Til tomorrow

Come what may

Tomorrow! Tomorrow!

I love ya Tomorrow!

You're always

A day

A way!
