One


[Musical Chorus Line]



One singular sensation, every little step she takes

One thrilling combination, every move that she makes

One smile and suddenly nobody else will do

You know you'll never be lonely with you-know-who



One moment in her presence and you can forget the rest

For the girl is second best to none, son

Oooh! Sigh! Give her your attention

Do I really have to mention she's the one



She walks into a room and you know she's

uncommonly rare, very unique

peripatetic, poetic and chic

She walks into a room and you know from her

maddening poise, effortless whirl

(One thrilling combination, every move that she makes

[ From: http://www.metrolyrics.com/one-lyrics-a-chorus-line.html ]

She's a special girl)

strolling



Can't help all of her qualities extolling

Loaded with charisma is ma

jauntily, sauntering, ambling, shambler

One, and you know you must

Shuffle along, join the parade

She's the quintessence of making the grade

This is whatcha call trav'ling!



Oh strut your stuff!

Can't get enough!

Ooh! Sigh! Give her your attention

Do I really have to mention

She's the one!
