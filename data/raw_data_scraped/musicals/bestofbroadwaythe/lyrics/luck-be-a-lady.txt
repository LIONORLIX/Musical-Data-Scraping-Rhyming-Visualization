Luck Be A Lady


[Musical "Guys And Dolls"]



They call you Lady Luck.

But there is room for doubt

At times you have a very unladylike way of running out

You're this a date with me

The pickings have been lush

And yet before this evening is over you might give me the brush

You might forget your manners

You might refure to stay and So the best that I can to is pray.



Luck be a lady tonight

Luck be a lady tonight

Luck if you've ever been a lady to begin with

Luck be a lady tonight.



Luck let a gentleman see

How nice a dame you can be

I've seen the way you've treated other guys you've been with

Luck be a lady with me.



A lady doesn't leave her escort

It isn't fair, it isn't nice

A lady doesn't wander all over the room

And blow on some other guy's dice.

So let's keep the party polite

Never get out of my sight

Stick with me baby, I'm the fellow you came in with

Luck be a lady

Luck be a lady

Luck be a lady tonight.



Luck be a lady tonight.

Luck be a lady tonight.

Luck, if you've ever been a lady to begin with

Luck be a lady tonight.



Luck let a gentleman see



Luck let a gentleman see



How nice a dame you can be



How nice a dame you can be



I know the way you've treated other guys you've been with



Luck me a lady, a lady, be a lady with me.



Luck be a lady with me



A Lady wouldn't flirt with strangers

She'd have a heart, she'd have a soul

A lady wouldn't make little snake eyes at me

When I've got my life on this roll.



Roll 'em, roll 'em, roll 'em, snake eyes

Roll 'em, roll 'em, roll 'em!



So let's keep the party polite



Let's keep the party polite



Never get out of my sight



CRAPSHOTERS



Never get out of my sight.

Stick here, baby, stick here, baby.



Stick with me, baby, I'm the fellow you came in with

Luck be a lady



Luck be a lady



Luck be a lady tonight.



Coming out, coming out, coming out Right!
