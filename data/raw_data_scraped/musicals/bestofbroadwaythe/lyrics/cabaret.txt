Cabaret


[Musical "Cabaret"]



What good is sitting alone in your room?

Come hear the music play.

Life is a Cabaret, old chum,

Come to the Cabaret.



Put down the knitting,

The book and the broom.

Time for a holiday.

Life is Cabaret, old chum,

Come to the Cabaret.



Come taste the wine,

Come hear the band.

Come blow your horn,

Start celebrating;

Right this way,

Your table's waiting



No use permitting

soem prophet of doom

To wipe every smile away.

Come hear the music play.

Life is a Cabaret, old chum,

Come to the Cabaret!



I used to have a girlfriend

known as Elsie

With whom I shared

Four sordid rooms in Chelsea



She wasn't what you'd call

A blushing flower...

As a matter of fact

She rented by the hour.



The day she died the neighbors

came to snicker:

"Well, thats what comes

from to much pills and liquor."



But when I saw her laid out like a Queen

She was the happiest...corpse...

I'd ever seen.



I think of Elsie to this very day.

I'd remember how'd she turn to me and say:

"What good is sitting alone in your room?

Come hear the music play.

Life is a Cabaret, old chum,

Come to the Cabaret."



And as for me,

I made up my mind back in Chelsea,

When I go, I'm going like Elsie.



Start by admitting

From cradle to tomb

Isn't that long a stay.

Life is a Cabaret, old chum,

Only a Cabaret, old chum,

And I love a Cabaret!
