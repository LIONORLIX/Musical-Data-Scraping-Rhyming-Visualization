Babkak, Omar, Aladdin, Kassim


A good pals, blood brothers

Me and three others

Babkak, Omar, Aladdin, Kassim



Four friends, none closer

Get mad? Heck no, sir!

Not us, four-strong, a permanent team



Four guys out poundin'

The pavements of Agraba

Poor guys with one Alabian dream



To stay this lazy

And play like crazy

Babkak, Omar, Aladdin, Kassim



True friends, no phonies

Me and my cronies

Babkak, Omar, Aladdin, Kassim



Four bums, none better

Not one, go-getter

Unmontivated in the extreme



Folks say, "Hey, go earn a living in Agraba!

Grow up, go earn the city's esteem!"

We say, "Tough noogie!

No way! Let's boogie!"

Babkak, Omar, Aladdin, Kassim



Four guys out passing the turban in Agraba

For lettring off some musical stream

That's our finale



'Kay guys, let's blow this alley

Babkak, Omar, Aladdin and

How's that so far? Not bad!

It's eight eyes with one impermanent gleam



Babkak, Omar, Aladdin, Kassim

Babkak, Omar, Aladdin, Kassim
