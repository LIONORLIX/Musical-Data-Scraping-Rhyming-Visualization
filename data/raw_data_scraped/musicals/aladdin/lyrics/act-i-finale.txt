Act I Finale


[spoken]

(Aladdin)

Genie, I wish for you to make me a prince!



(Genie)

At last it's wish fulfillment time!

You're wish is my command

Stand back, Al!

Let a Genie be a Genie

Hmm, first thing we gotta do is we gotta fix that ensemble

I mean that vest and pants combo, it's much too Third Century

And that fez!

What are you? A shriner?!

It's just not working boo!

And looking at your skin tone, I'm going to guess you're a winter

So I'm thinking jewel tones

Oh! Actually jewels!!

Oh this is going to be perfect!

It's make-oveeerrrrr time!



[sung]

Mr. Aladdin sir

Have a wish or two or three

You ain't never had a friend

Never had a friend

You ain't never had a friend

Never had a friend

You ain't never

Had a

Friend

Like

Me!



[spoken]

(Aladdin)

I don't believe it!

Look at me!



(Genie)

Let's see that princess resist you now!

Now if you excuse me, I've got a little royal entourage to whip up

I might even throw in a magic carpet!



(Aladdin)

Uh, a magic carpet?



(Genie)

Trust me! You'll need it

Oh, and Al,

You're gunna do great!



[sung]

(Aladdin)

This is my moment to change

Make a wish,

Say a prayer.

I made a promise

And I'm gunna keep it this time

I swear and

Some day and soon

I'll make you

Proud of your boy

So don't look back

Cause the boy that you knew

Isn't there anymore

And mom those dreams that you had for me

I'll make sure that they happen, I guarantee

Mom, I will try to

Try hard

To make you

Proud of your boy
