Diamond in the Rough


[Jafar (spoken):]

You're the one that I need

You're nimble, stealthy, skilled.

Do you want to continue abusing those skills?

Stealing bits of bread and worthless bobbles?

Or do you want to make a name for yourself

And do something that would make any mother proud?



(Sung) You have the profile of a prince

With a physique that matches

Beneath the dirt and patches

You are a diamond in the rough



I say we work together since

You're braver then which you are

We're just as shocked as you are

That you're a diamond in the rough



[Aladdin:]

Hey I'm no diamond in the rough



[Jafar:]

Under the filth and the fleas there are gifts that you've been neglecting

And truth be told you are not quite the guy that we were expecting

And though you might need finesse, and perhaps some... disinfecting

You'll be the one who succeeds when the lamp of their needs collecting



[Aladdin (Spoken):]

Uhhh, I dunno guys, I've got a funny feeling about this.

I better just be on my way.

[Jafar (Spoken):]

Take one step and die you brainless miscreant!

[Iago (Spoken):]

Happy place!

[Jafar (Spoken):]

Apologies

What I meant to say is



[Jafar:]

You just don't know how swell you are

[Iago:]

You just don't know how swell you are!

[Jafar:]

So far the only hitch is

[Iago:]

There's just an itty bitty hitch

[Jafar:]

You're an embarrassment of riches

[Iago:]

Embarrassing? Too true!

[Jafar:]

You are the diamond in the rough

[Iago:]

Let's all rejoice the spooky voice and

You're the diamond in the rough!



[Jafar:]

Look here's the diamond in the

[Iago:]

Three cheers, the diamond in the

[Jafar and Iago:]

We found the diamond in the rough!



[Aladdin (Spoken):]

You better find somebody else!

[Jafar (Spoken):]

There is nobody else!

[Iago (Spoken):]

Talk about the girl



[Jafar:]

Oh- Then, of course there's Princess Jasmine

It's clear she took a shying to you

But, let me be frank,

With no cash in the bank,

You'll never win her heart

It just tears me apart

To see her slip right through your fingers



[Aladdin (Spoken):]

Which way is this cave of yours?



[Jafar:]

That a boy!

Go through you!

Might be a bum

But you're one

Of noble spirit



[Iago:]

It's just a cave that might eat you alive

No need to fear it!



[Aladdin:]

Well it's a risk that I might have to take



[Jafar and Iago:]

We're glad to hear it

[Jafar:]

So please no missteps or blunders

[Iago:]

Cue the Cave of Wonders!

[Jafar and Iago:]

We've waited long enough



[Cave of Wonders (Spoken):]

Who disturbs my slumber?

[Aladdin (Spoken):]

Uhh, it is I, Aladdin

[Cave of Wonders (Spoken):]

You are the diamond in the rough

The one whose worth lies deep within

You may enter

[Aladdin (Spoken):]

I don't believe it

My mother always said if I only applied myself - If I only believed!

[Jafar (Spoken):]

We don't have time for self-discovery!

Fetch me the lamp. Now!

[Aladdin (Spoken):]

Wish me luck!

[Jafar (Spoken):]

Luck!



[Jafar:]

Goodbye you diamond in the

[Iago:]

Please try you diamond in the

[Jafar and Iago:]

Don't die you diamond in the rough



[Jafar:]

At last!
