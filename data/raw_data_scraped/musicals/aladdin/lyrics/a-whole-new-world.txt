A Whole New World


Aladdin

You must feel trapped inside these walls

We'll run away, just you and me

Why not escape as evening falls?

Theres a whole world you've yet to see



Jasmine

(Spoken) If I go with you, will it be safe?



Aladdin

(Spoken) Sure...Do you trust me? I



Jasmine

(Spoken) What did you just say?



Aladdin

(Spoken) Do you trust me?



Jasmine

(Spoken) I'm not sure why, but...yes]



Aladdin

I can show you the world

Shining, shimmering, splendid

Tell me, princess, now when did

You last let your heart decide?



I can open your eyes

Take you wonder by wonder

Over, sideways and under

On a magic carpet ride



A whole new world

A new fantastic point of view

No one to tell us no or where to go

Or say we're only dreaming



Jasmine

A whole new world

A dazzling place I never knew

But when I'm way up here, it's crystal clear

That now I'm in a whole new world with you



Aladdin

Now I'm in a whole new world with you



Jasmine

Unbelievable sights

Indescribable feeling

Soaring, tumbling, freewheeling

Through an endless diamond sky



Jasmine

A whole new world



Aladdin

Don't you dare close your eyes



Jasmine

A hundred thousand things to see



Aladdin

Hold your breath, it gets better



Jasmine

I'm like a shooting star

I've come so far

I can't go back

To where I used to be



Aladdin

A whole new world



Princess Jasmine

Every turn a surprise



Aladdin

With new horizons to pursue



Jasmine

Every moment gets better



Both

I'll chase them anywhere

There's time to spare

Let me share this whole new world with you

I can't go back

To where I used to be

Princess Jasmine

Every turn a surprise

Every moment gets better



Both

There's time to spare

Aladdin

A whole new world



Jasmine

A whole new world



Aladdin

That's where we'll be



Jasmine

That's where we'll be



Aladdin

A thrilling chase...



Jasmine

A wondrous place...



Both

For you and me
