Friend Like Me


(Scat fill) Can you give me a "bada-yada-yada"?

(Aladdin repeat)

Good! Scotty-wop

(Aladdin repeat)

Everybody! Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo

(Audience repeat)

(Scat fill) Hit it!



Well Ali Baba had them forty thieves

Scheherezad-ie had a thousand tales

But master you in luck 'cause up your sleeves

You got a brand of magic never fails

You got some power in your corner now

Some heavy ammunition in your camp

You got some punch, pizzazz, yahoo and how

See all you gotta do is rub that lamp

And I'll say



Mister Aladdin, sir

What will your pleasure be?

Let me take your order

Jot it down

You ain't never had a friend like me

No no no



Life is your restaurant

And I'm your maitre d'

C'mon whisper what it is you want

You ain't never had a friend like me



Yes sir, we pride ourselves on service

You're the boss

The king, the shah

Say what you wish

It's yours! True dish

How about a little more Baklava?



Have some of column "A"

Try all of column "B"

I'm in the mood to help you dude

You ain't never had a friend like me



Can your friends do this?

Do your friends do that?

Do your friends pull this out their little hat?

Can your friends go, poof?

Well, looky here

Can your friends go, Abracadabra, let 'er rip

And then make the sucker disappear?



So doncha sit there slack jawed, buggy eyed

I'm here to answer all your midday prayers

You got me bona fide, certified

You got a genie for your chare d'affaires

I got a powerful urge to help you out

So what-cha wish? I really wanna know

You got a list that's three miles long, no doubt

Well, all you gotta do is rub like so -



(Spoken) Come on! Yes! And oh...



(Sung)

Mister Aladdin, sir, have a wish or two or three

I'm on the job, you big nabob

You ain't never had a friend like...me!



(Spoken) Can your friends do this?

No really...can they? You're welcome!



Or maybe, our lucky contestant would like for a talent of fame? Welcome to 'Dancing With The Scimitars'!



Grab old Al, by the hand, swing him 'round 'till he can't stand, chicken in a basket, sparrow on a tree, never had a friend like me!



I'd like to bring the house down a little bit, sing a few old classics, couple of favorites of mine. I'll get back to you in a second! Thank you!



(Sung)

Tale as old as time...



(Spoken)

Thank you, thank you very much



(Sung)

True as it can be. Barely even friends, beauty and the...

Look at this stuff! Isn't it neat?! Wouldn't you think my collections complete?! Wouldn't you think I'm the genie who has everything?!



~Under the Sea Intro~



And you'll never hear the wolf cry to the blue corn moon, so whether we are white or copper skinned...



I want adventure in the great wide...

Ever just the same, ever a surprise, though he's sitting here, watch Al disappear, right before your eyes, oh!



(Spoken)

Yes!



(Sung)

Can you friends do this? Can you friends do that? can you friends do TAP?!



Can you friends do this? Can you friends do that? Can your friends do abracadabra? Let her rip?



(Spoken)

Give me a doggy bag; we're takin' it home!



(Sung)

Mister Aladdin, sir, have a wish or two or three

I'm on the job, you big nabob

You ain't never had a friend, never had a friend (You ain't never had a friend, never had a friend)

You ain't never (never!)

Had a (had a!)

Friend, like (a friend like) me!

Never had a friend like me!
