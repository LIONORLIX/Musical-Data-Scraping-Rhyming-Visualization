Proud of Your Boy (Reprise I)


I Know That I...

Was A Louse

And A Loafer...

You Won't Get A Fight,

I Agree...



I was a bold brick,

A Goof-Off, No Good

So How Did This Happen To Me?



Proud Of Your Boy...

I Hope Your Proud Of Your Boy...



Cause' I Don't Feel Any Taller

Or Smarter

Or Handsome or Wise...



And Now I Know What I Have To Do...

How Can I Be A Prince? When It Isn't True!



So I Will Try To Try Hard

To Make You Proud



Of Your Boy...
