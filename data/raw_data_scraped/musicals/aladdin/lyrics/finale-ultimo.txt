Finale Ultimo


GENIE

So we close short and sweet, now they live down the street, doing just what they all do best



Laws get changed just in time, and for them no more crime, and for Genie? A well earned rest!



It's the book that you knew, with a small twist of two, but the changes we made slight.



So salaam worthy friend, come back soon, thats the end, 'till another Arabian night!



CHORUS

Ah!



ALADDIN AND JASMINE

A whole new world, a new fantastic point of view

No one to tell us no, or where to go, or say we're only dreaming



CHORUS

A whole new world, with new horizons to peruse

I'll chase them anywhere, theres time to spare, let me share this whole new world with you!



GENIE

A whole new world...

That's we're I'll be...



ALL

A thrilling chase, a wondrous place...



GENIE

(Spoken) I just love a happy ending!



ALL

...for you and me!



Ah-ah-ah-ah!

Ah-ah-ah-ah!
