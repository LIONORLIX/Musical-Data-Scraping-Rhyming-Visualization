A Million Miles Away


[Aladdin:]

(Spoken) Have you ever imagined what it'd be like to take off, and never look back?



[Jasmine:]

(Spoken) Only ever hour of every day



[Aladdin:]

(Spoken) What's stopping us?



(Sung) We'll join a caravan tonight,

Count on the stars to be our guides.

We'll simply vanish out of sight,

Go where the dessert road decides.

There won't be any obligations



[Jasmine:]

Or fathers to obey.



[Aladdin:]

'Cause we'll be a million miles away,

Leave everything behind.

When you choose to loose yourself,

Who knows what you might find.

And once the journeys done,

You'll have some faith in me.

After a million miles or so,

We might feel like we're free.



[Jasmine:]

Maybe we'll travel on the sea.



[Aladdin:]

Ah ha! I'll tend the sails, and you can steer.



[Jasmine:]

Watch the waves roll on endlessly,



[Aladdin:]

And the horizon disappear.



[Jasmine:]

We'll leave all thoughts about the future,

'Till some future day.



[Both:]

'Cause we'll be a million miles away,

Leave everything behind.

When you choose to loose yourself,

Who knows what you might find.

And once the journeys done,

It won't seem quite so far.

After a million miles or so,

We'll find out who we are.



[Jasmine:]

Follow wherever the wind starts blowing.



[Aladdin:]

A million miles away.

The kind of a life people dream of knowing.



[Jasmine:]

A million miles away.



[Both:]

We'll never turn back,

Just keep on going.

Vanishing from view,

Becoming someone new.



We'll be a million miles away,

Leave everything behind.

When you choose to loose yourself,

Who knows what you might find.

And once the journeys done,

We'll have no need to roam.

After a million miles or so,

We might find out we're home.



After a million miles or so,

We might find out we're home.
