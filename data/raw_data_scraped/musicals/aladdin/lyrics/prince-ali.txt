Prince Ali


Hail, your attention I crave

Oh ye people of Agrabah

This is your lucky day



Hail, high and low, great and small

Lucky people of Agrabah,

Someone's coming to call

(Take it away Babkak)



Someone who tamed the cyclops

Then fought forty theives single handed

He's richer than Krisos

He goes where he pleases

And this time he's chosen your land



Oh, oh-woah

Your land

Uh come on!

(Nobody's coming)



So here he is now with his band!



Make way for Prince Ali

Say hey, hey, hey!

It's Prince Ali



Hey! Clear the way in the old Bazaar

Hey you, let us through!

It's a bright new star, oh

Come be first on your block

To meet his eye!



Make way,

Here he comes!

Ring bells! Bang the drums!

Are you gonna love this guy!

Make way! (Make way)

Make way! (Make way)

Make way!



Prince Ali! Fabulous he!

Ali Ababwa

Genuflect, show some respect

Down on one knee!

Now, try your best to stay calm

Brush up your sunday salaam

Then come and meet his spectacular coterie



Prince Ali!

Mighty is he!

Ali Ababwa

Strong as ten regular men, definitely!

(That's right boys)

He once slew seventy Turks,

Mustaches, Sabres, real jerks!

Who gave those bad guys the works?

Why, Prince Ali!

(Yes he did!)

Prince, prince Ali

Prince Ali

Prince, prince Ali

Prince Ali!



He's got seventy-five golden camels (sing it mama!)

Purple peacocks

He's got fifty-three



When it comes to exotic-type mammals

Has he got a zoo?

I'm telling you

It's a world-class menagerie



Wow!

Prince Ali, wonderful he,

Ali Ababwa

He's essayed quite a parade

For you to see (he's essayed a parade)

So get on out in that street

Got someone I wantcha to meet

Come one start kissing the feet

Of prince Ali!



Say hey, hey!

Hey, hey!

Hey to prince Ali!

(One more time!)

Say hey, hey!

Hey, hey!

Hey to prince Ali!



Ba-badabada

(Sounding good fellas)

Ba-badabada

(Hit me one more time)

Ba-badabada

[Over the top] There's no question this Ali's impressive

Ba-badabada

Though, his entourage might be excessive

Ba-badabada

All those elephants at once can quite unnerve one

Ba-badabada

Still, the man gives a parade new meaning

And the sight of all those peacocks preening

He's a prince without a peer

And we deserve one!



There's no question this Ali's alluring                     Prince Ali, fabulous he

Never ordinary!                                                       Ali Abwabwa

Never boring!                                                          That physique!

Everything about the man just plain impresses      How can I speak?

He's a winner, he's a wizz                                       I'm weak at the knee

A wonder!                                                                Well get on out in that square

He's about to put my heart asunder                       Adjust your veil and prepare

And I absolutely love the way he dresses               To gawk and grovel and stare

At Prince Ali!



He's got ninety-five white Persian monkeys

(He's got the monkeys, let's see the monkeys)

And to view them he charges no fee

(He's generous, so generous)

He's got slaves, he's got servants and flunkies

(Proud to work for him)

They bow to his whim (love serving him)

They're just lousy with loyalty to Ali!

Prince Ali!



Prince Ali!

Amorous he!

Ali Ababwa

Heard your princess was a sight (ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)

Lovely to see

And that, good people, is why

He got dolled up and dropped by

With sixty elephants, llamas galore

With his bears and lions

A brass band and more

With his forty fakirs, his cooks, his bakers

His birds that warble on key

Make way for prince...

Prince Ali!



Say hey to prince Ali! (Prince Ali)

Say hey, hey, hey to prince ali!

Badabadaba bow!

Badabadaba ba ba ba badow!
