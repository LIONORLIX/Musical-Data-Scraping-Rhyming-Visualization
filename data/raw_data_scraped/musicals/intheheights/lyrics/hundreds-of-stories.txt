ABUELA CLAUDIA

Are you okay?



ABUELA CLAUDIA/USNAVI

Paciencia y fe!

Paciencia y fe!



USNAVI

Let me see it again



ABUELA CLAUDIA

We kept it safe



USNAVI

So we survived the night, what happens today?



ABUELA CLAUDIA

A third for you



USNAVI

Uh huh uh huh

uh huh uh huh



ABUELA CLAUDIA

A third for me



USNAVI

No pare sigue sigue



ABUELA CLAUDIA

The rest for Sonny-

And with our share of the money

And with our share of the money-

Dream of the seaside air

See me beside you there

Think of the hundreds of stories we will share

You and I



USNAVI/ABUELA CLAUDIA

Ay



ABUELA CLAUDIA

Now you can sell your store

Open a bar by the shore

I've told you hundreds of stories about home

Make some more



USNAVI/ABUELA CLAUDIA

More



USNAVI

Yo! I know just where to go

There's a little beach named Playa Rincon

With no roads, you need a rowboat or motorbike

To reach this beach

It's just a stone's throw from home

My folks' home

Before I was born

Before they passed on

And left me on my own, in New York, with the grocery store

They would talk about home, I listened closely for the way they whispered to each other

'Bout the warmer winter weather

Inseparable, they even got sick together

They never got better

Passed away that December

And left me with these memories like dyin' embers

From a dream I can't remember

And ever since then it's like another day deeper in debt

With different dilemmas,

The bodega's a mess

I'll be seeing less of Vanessa

Abuela, I don't know how I can keep it together



ABUELA CLAUDIA

Remember the story of your name

It was engraved on a passing ship on the day your family came

You father said "Usnavi"

That's what we'll name the baby



USNAVI

It really said "US Navy," but hey

I worked with what they gave me okay



ABUELA CLAUDIA

They'd be so proud of you today



USNAVI

Then by the end of July



ABUELA CLAUDIA

Uh huh uh huh

Uh huh uh huh



USNAVI

Out where the sea meets the sky



ABUELA CLAUDIA

No pare sigue sigue!



USNAVI/ABUELA CLAUDIA

Think of the hundreds of stories we'll create

You and I



ABUELA CLAUDIA

Ay

We'll find your island-



USNAVI

I'll find my island sky



ABUELA CLAUDIA

Ay, find your island-



USNAVI

But whatever we do it's



USNAVI/ABUELA CLAUDIA

You and I!
