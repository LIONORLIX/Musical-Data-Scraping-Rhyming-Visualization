Champagne


VANESSA

So I got you a present

I went downtown to get it

You doing anything tonight?



USNAVI

Cleaning



VANESSA

You're done for the day



USNAVI

No way



VANESSA

Cuz we got a date



USNAVI

Okay



VANESSA

Before you board that plane

I owe you a bottle of cold champagne



USNAVI

No



VANESSA

Yeah, cold champagne



USNAVI

Damn, the bottle's all sweaty and everything

You went and got this?



VANESSA

Pop the champagne



USNAVI

I don't know if we have coffee cups

Or plastic cups

I think Sonny has the cups-



VANESSA

Tonight we're drinking straight from the bottle

Usnavi?



USNAVI

Yeah?



VANESSA

Daniela told me what you did for me

And it's honestly the sweetest thing anyone ever did for me

Now what can I say or do to possibly repay you for your kindness?



USNAVI

How do you get this gold shit off?



VANESSA

Usnavi!



USNAVI

Yeah!



VANESSA

Before we both leave town

Before the corner changes

And the signs are taken down

Let's walk around the neighborhood and say our goodbyes

Usnavi, are you alright?



USNAVI

I'm fine, I'm tryin'a open this champagne

See the twisty thing is broken

But I'm gonna open this damn champagne



VANESSA

Let me see it



USNAVI

No, I got it



VANESSA

Yo, Usnavi, drop the champagne



USNAVI

I mean you went to all this trouble to get us a little bubbly-



VANESSA

And it's gonna be okay



USNAVI

I'm sorry, it's been a long day



VANESSA

You oughta stay



USNAVI

What?



VANESSA

You can use that money to fix this place



USNAVI

Ha ha, very funny



VANESSA

And it's not like Sonny's got role models-



USNAVI

Role models?



VANESSA

Stepping up to the plate



USNAVI

Yo, what are you talking about?



VANESSA

I'm just saying, I think your vacation can wait



USNAVI

Vacation? Vanessa, you're leaving too



VANESSA

I'm going down to West 4th Street

You can take the A



USNAVI

What are you trying to say?



VANESSA

You're leaving the country and we're never gonna see you again



USNAVI

What are you trying to say?



VANESSA

You get everyone addicted to your coffee and off you go



USNAVI

Vanessa, I don't know why you're mad at me



VANESSA

I wish I was mad.

(She kisses him)

I'm just too late.
