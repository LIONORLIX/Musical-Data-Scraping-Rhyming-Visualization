BOLERO SINGER

No te vayas...

Si me dejas...

Si te alejas de mi...

Seguiras en mis recuerdos para siempre...

Para siempre...

Para siempre...

Para siempre...

Para siempre...

(continues under next rap)



USNAVI

Lights out on Washington Heights

And now the crack of dawn

The blackout goes on and on and on...

Sonny's out back, sortin' the trash

As I think about the past,

With a sack full of cash

Abuela really wanted me up on a beach

With margaritas in my reach,

And soon that's how it's gonna be...

Imagine me, leaving today

On a seven-forty-seven

Boardin' JFK...



CARLA

The hydrants are open

Cool breezes blow



CARLA/DANIELA

The hydrants are open

Cool breezes blow



DANIELA/CARLA

The hydrants are open



KEVIN

Good morning



PIRAGUA GUY

Piragua, piragua



DANIELA/CARLA

Cool breezes blow



PIRAGUA GUY

New block of ice, piragua

So sweet and nice, piragua

Piragua, piragua



DANIELA/CARLA

The hydrants are open

Cool breezes blow



KEVIN

Good morning



PIRAGUA GUY

Piragua, piragua

New block of ice, piragua

So sweet and nice, piragua

Piragua, piragua



CAMILA

Seguiras en mis recuerdos

Para siempre...



DANIELA/CARLA

So sweet and nice, piragua

Piragua, piragua



CAMILA

Siempre...

Seguiras en mis recuerdos

Para siempre...



VANESSA

I'll be downtown

It won't be long now...



USNAVI

There's a breeze off the Hudson

And just when you think you're sick of living here

The memory floods in

The morning light, off the fire escapes

The nights in Bennett Park, blasting big pun tapes

I'm-a miss this place, to tell you the truth

Kevin, dispensin' wisdom from his dispatch booth

And at dawn, Vanessa at the salon

We gotta move on

And who's gonna notice we're gone?

When our job's done

As the evening winds down to a crawl, son

Can I ease my mind

When we're all done

When we've resigned

In the long run

What do we leave behind?

Most of all, I'll miss Abuela's whispers

Doin' the lotto Pick Six every Christmas

In five years, when this whole city's rich folks and hipsters

Who's gonna miss this raggedy little business?



GRAFFITI PETE

What it do? Haha, great sunlight this morning.



SONNY

Yo cuz. We fixed the grate.



USNAVI

(to SONNY) What did I tell you about this punk?



SONNY

You have to commission an artist while his rate is still good!



GRAFFITI PETE

The first work in my new series.



(GRAFFITI PETE rolls down the gate.

There is a huge graffiti mural of ABUELA CLAUDIA that says PACIENCIA Y FE. Silence.)



GRAFFITI PETE

He hates it.



SONNY

Shh. He's forming an artistic opinion.



USNAVI

You did this last night?



GRAFFITI PETE

Yeah.



USNAVI

There goes my flight



SONNY

What?



USNAVI

Graffiti Pete, you're gonna need some new cans

Here's some money, finish up, there's been a slight change of plans



GRAFFITI PETE

Nice!



USNAVI

Listen up guys, you got a job, I'm not playin'

You gotta go now, tell the whole block I'm stayin'!

Y'all go ahead, tell everyone we know!

Sonny...



(USNAVI starts to say something, but gets choked up, motions to his own heart.)



USNAVI

Alright, go!

Yeah, I'm a streetlight, chillin' in the heat!

I illuminate the stories of the people in the street

Some have happy endings, some are bittersweet

But I know them all and that's what makes my life complete



NINA

We're home-



USNAVI

And if not me, who keeps our legacies?

Who's gonna keep the coffee sweet with secret recipes?

Abuela, rest in peace, you live in my memories

Sonny's gotta eat, and this corner is my destiny



SONNY/NINA/CARLA/DANIELA

We're home-



USNAVI

Brings out the best in me

We pass a test and we keep pressin' and yes indeed

You know I'll never leave

If you close your eyes that hydrant is a beach

That siren is a breeze, that fire escape's a leaf on a palm tree



COMMUNITY

We're home-



USNAVI

Abuela, I'm sorry

But I ain't goin' back because I'm telling your story!

And I can say goodbye to you smilin'

I found my island

I've been on it this whole time

I'm home!



COMMUNITY

We're home-

The hydrants are open

Cool breezes blow-



USNAVI

It's a wonderful life that I've known

"Merry Christmas you ole' building and loan!"

I'm home!



COMMUNITY

We're home-

The hydrants are open

Cool breezes blow-



USNAVI

Abuela, that ain't a stoop, that's your throne

Long after ya birds have all flown



USNAVI

I'm home!

Where the coffee's non-stop

And I drop this hip-hop

In my mom and pop shop

I'm home!



COMMUNITY

We're home!



USNAVI

Where people come

People go

Let me show all of these people what I know

There's no place like home!



COMMUNITY

We're home!



USNAVI

And let me set the record straight

I'm steppin' to Vanessa

I'm gettin' a second date!

I'm home!



COMMUNITY

We're home!



USNAVI

Where it's a hundred in the shade

But with patience and faith

We remain unafraid

I'm home!



COMMUNITY

Home!



USNAVI

You hear that music in the air?

Take the train to the top of the world

And I'm there

I'm



COMMUNITY

Home!
