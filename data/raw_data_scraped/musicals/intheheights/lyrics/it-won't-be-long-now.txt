It Won't Be Long Now


VANESSA

The elevated train by my window doesn't faze me anymore

The rattling screams don't disrupt my dreams

It's a lullaby, in its way

The elevated train drives everyone insane but I don't mind, oh no

When I bring back boys they can't tolerate the noise

And that's okay cuz I never let them stay

And one day, I'm hoppin that elevated train and I'm ridin away

It won't be long now

The boys around the way

Holler at me when I'm walkin down the street

Their machismo pride doesn't break my stride-

It's a compliment, so they say

They boys around the way

Holler at me every day but I don't mind, oh no

If I'm in the mood, it will not be with some dude

Who is whistling cuz he has nothing to say

Or who's honking at me from his Chevrolet

And one day, I'm hoppin in a limousine and I'm ridin away

It won't be long now

Ay ,Usnavi, help SOS!



USNAVI

Good morning, Vanessa!

If it isn't the loveliest girl in the place



VANESSA

You've got some schmutz on your face



SONNY

SONNY/USNAVI

DANIELA

(Screaming from the salon) VANESSAAA! I'm thirsty, cono!



VANESSA

Can I get a Pepsi and some packing tape?



SONNY

Uh, my cousin over there with his tongue hanging out, has been meaning to ask you...



VANESSA

Yes?



SONNY

What would a lady such as yourself might be doing tonight?



VANESSA

Does your cousin dance?



SONNY

Like a drunk Chita Rivera



VANESSA

Okay...after Nina's dinner, we can hit a few clubs and check out the fireworks...



USNAVI

Oh snap!

Who's that?

Don't touch me, I'm too hot! Yes!

Que paso?

Here I go!

So dope!

Y tu lo sabes!

No pare



SONNY/USNAVI

Sigue sigue!



USNAVI

Did you see me?



SONNY/USNAVI

Freaky Freakit!



USNAVI

What a way to begin the weekend

Sonny, anything you want is free, man!

And my dearly beloved

Dominican Republic

I haven't forgotten



SONNY /USNAVI

You!



USNAVI

Gonna see this honey

Make a little money

An one day I'll hop Jet



SONNY/USNAVI

Blue!



USNAVI

But until that fateful day I'm grateful

I got a destination

I'm runnin to make it home

And home's what Vanessa's runnin away from!

I'm running to make it home

And home's what Vanessa's runnin away from...



VANESSA

The neighborhood salon is the place I am working for the moment

As I cut their hair, ladies talk and share-

Every day, who's doing who and why

The neighborhood salon doesn't pay me what I wanna be making but I don't mind

As I sweep the curb I can hear those turbo engines blazing a trail through the sky

I look up and think about the years gone by

But one day I'm walking to JFK and I'm gonna fly!

It won't be long now

Any day
