Alabanza


USNAVI

She was found and pronounced at the scene

She was already lying in bed

The paramedics said

That her heart gave out

I mean, that's basically what they said

They said a combination of the stress and the heat

Why she never took her medicine, I'll never understand

I'd like to think she went out in peace

With pieces of bread crumbs in her hand

Abuela Claudia had simple pleasures

She sang the praises of things we ignore

Glass Coke bottles, bread crumbs, a sky full of stars

She cherished these things

She'd say "Alabanza"

Alabanza means to raise this thing to God's face and to sing

Quite literally "praise to this"

When she was here, the path was clear

And she was just here

She was just here...
