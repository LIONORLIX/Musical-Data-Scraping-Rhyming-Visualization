BENNY

Check 1 2 3 Check 1 2 3

This is Benny on the dispatch, yo

Atencion, yo, attention,

It's Benny and I'd like to mention

I'm on the microphone this mornin

Honk ya horn if ya want it

Okay, we got traffic on the west side

Get off at 79th and take the left side

Of Riverside Drive and ya might slide

West End's ya best best friend if you catch the lights

And don't take Deegan

Manny Ramirez is in town this weekend

Sorry Dominicans, take Route 87, you ain't getting back in again

Hold up a minute



NINA

BENNY

NINA

BENNY

Of your folks, they're on their way



NINA

BENNY

It's good to see your face



NINA

BENNY

Hold up a minute, wait

You used to run this dispatch, right?



NINA

Once or twice-



BENNY

Well check the technique! yo!

There's a traffic accident I have to mention

At the intersection of 10th ave and the Jacob Javitz Convention Center

And check it, don't get stuck in the rubber-neckin on 192nd

There's a double-decker bus wreck

Now listen up we got a special guest

Live and direct from a year out west

Welcome her back, cuz she looks mad stressed

Nina Rosario, the barrio's best

Honk your horns

She's smiling

Say hello



NINA

(into the radio) Hello. Good morning!

(She hands back the radio)

I better find my folks

Thanks for the welcome wagon



BENNY

Anytime, Anytime, Nina

Wait here with me

It's getting hot outside, turn up the AC

Stay here with me
