When The Sun Goes Down


BENNY

When the sun goes down

You're gonna need a flashlight

You're gonna need a candle-



NINA

I think I can manage that



BENNY

When you leave town

I'm gonna buy you a calling card



NINA/BENNY

Cuz I am falling hard for you



NINA

I go back on Labor Day



BENNY

And I will try to make my way



BENNY/NINA

Out west to California



BENNY

We've got this summer



NINA

And we've got each other

Perhaps even longer



BENNY

When you're on your own

And suddenly without me

Will you forget about me?



NINA

I couldn't if I tried



BENNY

When I'm all alone and I close my eyes



BENNY/NINA

That's when I'll see your face again



BENNY

And when you're gone

You know that I'll be waiting

When you're gone



NINA

But you're here with me right now



BENNY

We'll be working hard, but if we should drift apart



NINA

Benny-



BENNY

Lemme take this moment just to say



NINA

No, no-



BENNY

You are gonna change the world someday



NINA

I'll be thinking of home



BENNY/NINA

And I'll think of you every night

At the same time



BENNY

When the sun goes down



NINA

When the sun goes down



BENNY

When the sun goes down
