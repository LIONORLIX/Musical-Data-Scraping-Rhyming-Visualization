USNAVI:

96,000...



SONNY/BENNY:

Damn...



USNAVI:

96,000...



SONNY:

Dollers? Holla.



USNAVI:

96,000...



BENNY:

Yo, somebody won!



USNAVI:

96,000...



BENNY:

Yo...

If I won the lotto tomorrow

well I know

I wouldn't bother going on no spending spree

I'd pick a business school and pay the entrance fee

Then maybe, if you're lucky, you'll stay friends with me.

I'll be a business man,

richer than Nina's daddy,

Donald Trump and I on the links,

and he's my caddy

My money's making money, I'm going from po' to moto

Keep the bling, I want the brass ring like frodo!



USNAVI:

Oh no, there goes mr. Braggadocio

Next thing you know, you're lying like pinnochio



BENNY:

Well if you're scared of the bull, stay out of the rodeo!



GRAFFITI PETE:

Yo, I got more hoes than a phone book in tokyo!



USNAVI!

Ooh, you'd better stop rappin'

You're not ready

It's gonna get hot and heavy and you're already sweaty-



GRAFFITI PETE:

y-y-yo-yo



USNAVI:

Yo, I'm sorry, was that an answer?

Shut up, go home and pull your damn pants up!

As for you, Mr. Frodo of the shire, 96 gs ain't enough to retire



BENNY:

I'll have enough to knock your ass of its axis!



USNAVI:

You'll have a knapsack full of jack after taxes!



SONNY:

96,000!



ABUELA CLAUDIA:

SONNY:

DANIELA/CARLA:

No me diga!



SONNY:

96,000!



VANESSA:

I never win shit!



SONNY:

96,000!



BENNY:

for real, though,

imagine how it must feel going real slow

down the highway of life

with no regrets

and no breaking your neck for respect or a paycheck

for real, though, I'll take a break from the wheel

and we'll throw the biggest block party, everybody here

It's a weekend when we can breathe, take it easy



NEIGHBORS:

Yo! ma, it's me, check my tickets!



CARLA:

Check one two three what would you do with 96 gs?



DANIELA:

who, me?



CARLA:

I mean, if it's just between you and me-



DANIELA:

esa pregunta es tricky!



CARLA:

I know!



DANIELA:

with 96 g,

I'd start my life with a brand new lease

atlantic city with a malibu breeze



CARLA:

and a brand new weave-



DANIELA:

or maybe just bleach...



VANESSA:

Y'all are freaks



USNAVI:

Yo, I'm just sayin...

it's silly when we get into

these crazy hypotheticals

you really want some bread

then go ahead and create a set of goals

and cross them off the list as you pursue them

and with those 96 i know precisely what i'm doing



VANESSA:

what you doing?



USNAVI:

What am i doing? what am I doing?

It takes most of that cash just to save my ass from financial ruin

sonny can keep the coffee brewin'

and i'll spend a few on you

cause the only room with a view's a room with you in it

and i could give abuela claudia the rest of it

just fly me down to puerta plata, I'll make the best of it

You really love this business?



SONNY:

no.



USNAVI:

tough, merry christmas.

you're now the youngest tycoon in washington hiznits.



SONNY:

Yo!

with 96,000, I'd finally fix housing

give the barrio computers and wireless web browsing

Your kids are living without a good edumacation change the station,

teach them about gentrification, the rent is escalating



GRAFFITI PETE:

what?



SONNY:

the rich are penetrating



GRAFFITI PETE:

what?



SONNY:

We pay our corporations

when we should be demonstrating



GRAFFITI PETE:

WHAT?!



SONNY:

What about immigration?



GRAFFITI PETE:

what?



Sonny:

Racism in this nation's gone

from latent to balatent!



Community:

OOOH!



Sonny:

I'll cash my ticket and picket

Invest in protest

never lose my focus till the

city takes notice

and you know this, man!

I'll never sleep

Because the ghetto has a

Million promises for me to

keep!



VANESSA:

You are so cute!



SONNY:

I was just thinking off the top of my head.



USNAVI:

Benny:

For real, though.

Imagine how it would feel

goin' real slow

down the highway of life

with no regrets

and no breakin' your neck for respect

or a paycheck -



Vanessa:

If I win the lottery

You'll wonder where I've been

I'll be downtown,

see you around

If I win the lottery,

you won't see a lot of me!



Usnavi:

It's silly when we get into these crazy hypotheticals,

you really want some bread then go ahead,

create a set of goals and cross them off the list as you pursue em',

and with those Ninety six I know precisely what I'm doing!
