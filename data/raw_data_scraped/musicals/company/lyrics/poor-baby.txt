Poor Baby


SARAH:

Darling--



HARRY:

Yes?



SARAH:

Robert.



HARRY:

What?



SARAH:

I worry.



HARRY:

Why?



SARAH:

He's all alone.

There's no one--



HARRY:

Where?



SARAH:

In his life.



HARRY:

Oh.



SARAH:

Robert ought to have a woman.

Poor baby, all alone,

Evening after evening by the telephone.

We're the only tenderness he's ever known.

Poor baby!



JENNY:

David--



DAVID:

Yes?



JENNY:

Robert.



DAVID:

What?



JENNY:

I worry.



DAVID:

Why?



JENNY:

It's such a waste.

There's no one--



DAVID:

Where?



JENNY:

In his life.



DAVID:

Oh.



JENNY:

Robert ought to have a woman.

Poor baby, sitting there,

Staring at the walls and playing solitaire,

Making conversation with the empty air.

Poor baby!



[Later, as Robert takes April to bed]



SARAH:

Robert...



JENNY:

Bobby...



SARAH:

Robert, angel...



JENNY:

Bobby, honey...



SARAH:

You know,

No one

Wants you to be happy

More than I do,

No one,

But isn't she a little bit, well,

You know,

Face it,

Why her?

Better,

No one--



JENNY:

...wants you to be happy

More than I do,

No one,

But--



SARAH & JENNY:

Isn't she a little bit, well,

You know,

Face it--



SUSAN:

You know, no one

Wants you to be happy

More than I do--



AMY & JOANNE:

You know, no one

Wants you to be happy

More than I do,

No one,

But--



ALL:

Isn't she a little bit, well--



[Variously]



Dumb?

Tacky?

Vulgar?

Old?

Tall?

Aggressive?

Where is she from?

Neurotic?

Peculiar?

And cheap?

She seems so dead.

She's tall enough to be your mother.

And gross?

Depressing?

She's very weird.

And immature?

Goliath!



[Together]



Poor baby, all alone,

Throw a lonely dog a bone, it's still a bone.

We're the only tenderness he's ever known.

Poor baby!
