Sorry-Grateful


ROBERT [speaking]:

Harry, you ever sorry you got married?



HARRY:

You're always sorry,

You're always grateful,

You're always wondering

What might have been--

Then she walks in.



And still you're sorry,

And still you're grateful,

And still you wonder

And still you doubt--

And she goes out.



Everything's different, nothing's changed.

Only maybe slightly rearranged.



You're sorry-grateful,

Regretful-happy.

Why look for answers

When none occur?

You always are what you always were,

Which has nothing to do with, all to do with her.



DAVID:

You're always sorry,

You're always grateful,

You hold her, thinking:

"I'm not alone."

You're still alone.



You don't live for her,

You do live with her,

You're scared she's starting

To drift away,

And scared she'll stay.



LARRY:

Good things get better, bad get worse.

Wait, I think I meant that in reverse.



HARRY, DAVID, LARRY:

You're sorry-grateful,

Regretful-happy.

Why look for answers

When none occur?

You'll always be what you always were,

Which has nothing to do with, all to do with her.



HARRY:

Nothing to do with, all to do with her.
