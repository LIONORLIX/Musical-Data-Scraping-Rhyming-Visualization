ROBERT:

Phone rings,

Door chimes,

In comes

Company!

No strings,

Good times,

Room hums,

Company!

Late nights,

Quick bites,

Party games,

Deep talks,

Long walks,

Telephone calls.

Thoughts shared,

Souls bared,

Private names,

All those

Photos

Up on the walls--

"With love."

"With love" filling the days,

"With love" seventy ways,

"To Bobby with love"

From all those good and crazy people, my friends!

Those good and crazy people, my married friends!

And that's what it's all about, isn't it?

That's what it's really about,

Really about!
