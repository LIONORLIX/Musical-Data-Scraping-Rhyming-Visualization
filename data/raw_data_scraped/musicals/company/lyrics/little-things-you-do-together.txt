Little Things You Do Together


JOANNE:

It's the little things you do together,

Do together,

Do together,

That make perfect relationships.

The hobbies you pursue together,

Savings you accrue together,

Looks you misconstrue together,

That make marriage a joy.

M-hm...



It's the little things you share together,

Swear together,

Wear together,

That make perfect relationships.

The concerts you enjoy together,

Neighbors you annoy together,

Children you destroy together,

That keep marriage intact.



It's not so hard to be married

When two manoeuver as one.

It's not so hard to be married,

And, Jesus Christ, is it fun!



It's sharing little winks together,

Drinks together,

Kinks together,

That make marriage a joy.

The bargains that you shop together,

Cigarettes you stop together,

Clothing that you swap together,

That make perfect relationships.

Uh-huh...

M-hm...



FRIENDS:

It's not talk of God and the decade ahead that

Allows you to get through the worst.

It's "I do" and "you don't" and "nobody said that"

And "who brought the subject up first?"

It's the little things,

The little things, the little things, the little things.



The little ways you try together,

Cry together,

Lie together,

That make perfect relationships.

Becoming a cliche together,

Growing old and grey together,

Withering away together,

That make marriage a joy.



It's not so hard to be married,

It's much the simplest of crimes.

It's not so hard to be married--



JOANNE:

I've done it three or four times.



FRIENDS:

It's the people that you hate together,

Bait together,

Date together,

That make marriage a joy.

It's things like using force together,

Shouting till you're hoarse together,

Getting a divorce together,

That make perfect relationships.

Uh-huh...

Kiss-kiss...

M-hm...
