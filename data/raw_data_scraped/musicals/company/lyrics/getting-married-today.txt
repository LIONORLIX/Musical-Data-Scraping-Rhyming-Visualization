Getting Married Today


CHOIRGIRL:

Bless this day,

Pinnacle of life,

Husband joined to wife.

The heart leaps up to behold

This golden day.



PAUL:

Today is for Amy,

Amy, I give you the rest of my life,

To cherish and to keep you, to honor you forever.

Today is for Amy,

My happily soon-to-be wife.



AMY:

Pardon me, is everybody there? Because if everybody's there, I want to thank you all for coming to the wedding, I'd appreciate your going even more, I mean you must have lots of better things to do, and not a word of this to Paul, remember Paul, you know, the man I'm gonna marry, but I'm not, because I wouldn't ruin anyone as wonderful as he is

But I thank you all

For the gifts and the flowers,

Thank you all,

Now it's back to the showers,

Don't tell Paul,

But I'm not getting married today.



CHOIRGIRL:

Bless this day,

Tragedy of life,

Husband yoked to wife.

The heart sinks down and feels dead

This dreadful day.



AMY:

Listen, everybody, look, I don't know what you're waiting for, a wedding, what's a wedding, it's a prehistoric ritual where everybody promises fidelity forever, which is maybe the most horrifying word I ever heard of, which is followed by a honeymoon, where suddenly he'll realize he's saddled with a nut, and wanna kill me, which he should--

So listen, thanks a bunch,

But I'm not getting married--

Go have lunch,

'Cause I'm not getting married--

You've been grand,

But I'm not getting married--

Don't just stand there,

I'm not getting married--

And don't tell Paul,

But I'm not getting married today.



Go, can't you go?

Why is no-

Body listening?

Goodbye,

Go and cry

At another person's wake.

If you're quick,

For a kick,

You could pick

Up a christening,

But please,

On my knees,

There's a human life at stake!



Listen everybody, I'm afraid you didn't hear, or do you want to see a crazy lady fall apart in front of you, it isn't only Paul who may be ruining his life, you know we'll both of us be losing our identities, I telephoned my analyst about it and he said to see him Monday, but by Monday I'll be floating in the Hudson with the other garbage--

I'm not well,

So I'm not getting married--

You've been swell,

But I'm not getting married--

Clear the hall,

'Cause I'm not getting married--

Thank you all,

But I'm not getting married--

And don't tell Paul,

But I'm not getting married today.



CHOIRGIRL:

Bless this bride,

Totally insane,

Slipping down the drain.

And bless this day in our hearts

As it starts

To rain.



PAUL: Today is for Amy

AMY: Go, can't you go?



PAUL: Amy, I give you the rest of my life

AMY: Look, you know

I adore you all

But why

Watch me die,

Like Eliza on the ice?



PAUL: To cherish and to keep you, to honor you forever

AMY:Look, perhaps

I'll collapse

In the apse

Right before you all,



PAUL: Today is for Amy, my happily, soon-to-be wife

AMY:So take

Back the cake,

Burn the shoes

and boil the rice.



Look, I didn't wanna have to My adorable

tell you, but I may be coming Wife.

down with Hepatitis, and I

think I'm gonna faint, so if

you wanna see me faint, I'll

do it happily, but wouldn't

it be funnier to go and watch

a funeral, so thank you for the

twenty-seven dinner plates,

thirty-seven butter knives,

forty-seven paperweights,

fifty-seven candleholders--



PAUL:

One more thing--



AMY:

I am not getting married!



CHOIR:

Amen!



PAUL:

Softly said--



AMY:

But I'm not getting married!



CHOIR:

Amen!



PAUL:

With this ring--



AMY:

Still I'm not getting married!



CHOIR:

Amen!



PAUL:

I thee wed.



AMY:

See, I'm not getting married!



CHOIR:

Amen!



PAUL: AMY:

Let us pray Let us pray

That we are getting married That I'm not getting married

Today! Today!



CHOIR:

AMEN!!!
