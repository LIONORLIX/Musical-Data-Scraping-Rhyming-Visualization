Have I Got a Girl for You


FRIENDS:

Bobby...Bobby...Bobby baby...

Bobby bubbi...Robby...Robert darling...

Bobby, we've been trying to reach you...

Angel, I've got something to tell you...

Bobby, it's important or I wouldn't call...

Whatcha doin' Thursday?

Bobby, look, I know how you hate it and all...

But this is something special...

Not that you don't know a lot of lovely girls, but

Bobby, come on over for dinner!

There's someone we want you to meet!

Bobby, come on over for dinner!

This girl from the office...

My niece from Ohio...

It'll just be the four of us...

You'll looooooooooooooooooove her!



LARRY:

Have I got a girl for you! Wait till you meet her!

Have I got a girl for you, boy!

Hoo, boy!

Dumb! And with a weakness for sazarac slings!

You give her even the fruit and she swings.

The kind of girl you can't send through the mails!

Call me tomorrow, I want the details.



PETER:

Have I got a chick for you! Wait till you meet her!

Have I got a chick for you, boy!

Hoo, boy!

Smart! And into all those exotic mystiques--

The Kama Sutra and Chinese techniques.

I hear she knows more than seventy-five.

Call me tomorrow if you're still alive!



HUSBANDS:

Have I got a girl for you! Wait till you meet her!

Have I got a girl for you, boy!

Hoo, boy!

Boy! To be in your shoes what I wouldn't give!

I mean the freedom to go out and live!

And as for settling down and all that,

Marriage may be where it's been, but it's not where it's at.



Whaddya like? You like coming home to a kiss?

Somebody with a smile at the door?

Whaddya like? You like indescribable bliss?

Then whaddya wanna get married for?

Whaddya like? You like an excursion to Rome?

Suddenly taking off to explore?

Whaddya like? You like having meals cooked at home?

Then whaddya wanna get married for?

Whaddya wanna get married for?

Whaddya wanna get married for?

Whaddya wanna get married for?
