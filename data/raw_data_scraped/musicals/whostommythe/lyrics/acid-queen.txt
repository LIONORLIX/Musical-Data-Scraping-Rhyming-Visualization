Acid Queen


If your child ain't all he should be now

This girl could put him right.

I'll show him what he could be now

Just give me one night.

I'm the Gypsy - the acid queen.

Pay before we start.

I'm the Gypsy - I'm guaranteed.

I'll tear your soul apart.



Give us a room, close the door

Leave us for a while.

Your boy won't be a boy no more

Young, but not a child.

I'm the Gypsy - the acid queen.

Pay before we start.

The Gypsy - I'm guaranteed.

I'll tear your soul apart.



Gather your wits and hold on fast,

Your mind must learn to roam.

Just as the Gypsy Queen must do

You're gonna hit the road.



When the work is done,

You look at him,

He'll never be more alive.

Watch his body writhe!

I'm the Gypsy - the acid queen.

Pay before we start.

I'm the Gypsy - I'm guaranteed.

To break your little heart.



If your child ain't all he should be now

This girl will put him right.

I'll show him what he could be now

Just give me one night.

I'm the Gypsy - the acid queen.

Pay before we start.

I'm the Gypsy - I'm guaranteed.

to tear your soul apart
