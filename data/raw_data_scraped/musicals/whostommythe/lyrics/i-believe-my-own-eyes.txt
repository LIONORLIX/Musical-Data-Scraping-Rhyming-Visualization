I Believe My Own Eyes

This can't continue, It makes no sense

We're getting nowhere, I've lost all my confidence

The boy wants something, I'm satisfied

He needs attention and care our love can't provide

And then there's the matter of us.



I'd like to prove that I don't feel that you've seen the best of me

I've stood up for the boy and I've clung to the hopes and the lies

I wish that the pain in your gaze could again be a test of me

But when I look in the mirror

I believe my own eyes.



I believe my own eyes

Know I've come to the end

All my patience is gone

When I'm doubtful I tend

To believe my own eyes



I'd like to declare this devotion and care is the life to live

That nothing has changed and that time isn't passing us by

But I have to say here that for us,

There's a clear-cut alternative

When we look at each other, we believe our own eyes.



I believe my own eyes

Know I've come to the end

All my patience is gone

When I'm doubtful I tend

To believe my own eyes.



This has gone far enough

After all we've been through

We can't be blamed,

We've done all we can humanly do

It's a time to be tough

A time to be wise

We must stop chasing false dreams,

And recover our lives.



I believe my own eyes

Know I've come to the end

All my patience is gone

When I'm doubtful I tend

To believe...



I'd like to believe that I don't feel that we've seen the best of us

And the way to believe is to see where the real future lies

I hope that the pain in your gaze can again be a test of us

But when I look in the mirror

I belive my own eyes



Let's believe our own eyes

Know we've come to the end

All our patience is gone

Let's admit we intend

To believe our own eyes

To believe our own eyes
