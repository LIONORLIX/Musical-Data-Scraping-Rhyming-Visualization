Sally Simpson


Outside the house mr. Simpson announced

That sally couldn't go to the meeting.

He went on cleaning his blue rolls royce

And she ran inside weeping.

She got to her room and tears splashed the picture

Of a new messiah.

She picked up a book of her fathers life

And threw it on the fire!



She knew from the start

Deep down in her heart

That she and tommy were worlds apart...

But her mother said "never mind your part is to be...

What you'll be".



The theme of the sermon was come onto me,

And love will find a way,

So sally decided to ignore her dad,

And sneak out anyway!

She spent all afternoon getting ready,

And decided she'd try to touch him,

Maybe he'd see that she was free

And talk to her this sunday.



She knew from the start

Deep down in her heart

That she and tommy were worlds apart...

But her mother said "never mind your part is to be...

What you'll be".



She arrived at six and the place was swinging

To gospel music by nine.

Group after group appeared on the stage

And sally just sat there crying.

She bit her nails looking pretty as a picture

Right in the very front row.

Then a dj wearin' a blazer with a badge

Ran on and said, "here we go!"



The crowd went crazy

As tommy hit the stage!

Little sally got lost as the police bossed

The crowd back in a rage!



Soon the atmosphere was cooler

And tommy gave a lesson.

Sally just had to let him know she loved him

And lept up on the rostrum.

She ran across stage to the spot-lit figure

And brushed him on the face.

Tommy whirled 'round as a uniformed man

Threw her off the stage.



She knew from the start

Deep down in her heart

That she and tommy were worlds apart...

But her mother said "never mind your part is to be...

What you'll be".



Her cheek hit a chair and blood trickled down,

Mingling with her tears.

Tommy carried on preachin'

And his voice filled sally's ears.

She caught his eye, she had to try,

But he couldn't see through the lights.

Her face was gashed, and the ambulance men

Had to carry her out that night.



The crowd went crazy

As tommy left the stage!

Little sally was lost for the price of a touch

And a gash across her face! Oooooh.



Sixteen stitches put her right and her dad said:

"don't say i didn't warn ya".

Sally got married to a rock musician

She met in california.

Tommy always talks about the day

The disciples all went wild!

Sally still carries a scar on her cheek

To remind her of his smile.



She knew from the start

Deep down in her heart

That she and tommy were worlds apart...

But her mother said "never mind your part is to be...

What you'll be".
