Sally Simpson's Question


How can we share the great sights you are seeing?

Hear all the glorious music you hear?



How can we be a small part of your being?

Why do you seem so alive when you're near?



Tell us. Tell us now. How can we be more like you?



Why would you want to be more like me?

For fifteen years I was waiting for what you've already got.



What's that?



All this. In my dreams I was seeing it,

hearing it, feeling it. Those are

the true miracles and you have them already.



I don't understand.



The point is not for you to be more like me.

The point is...I'm finally more like you.

I can't be who you want me to be.
