Benjamin Calypso


Brothers



Oh no - not he

How can you accuse him is a mystery

Save him - take me

Benjamin is straightr than the tall palm tree

Judah



I hear the steel drums sing their song

They're singing man you know you've got it wrong

I hear the voice of the yellow bird

Singing in the tree this is quite absurd

Oh yes



Brothers



Oh yes

Judah



It's true

Brothers

Judah



Benjamin is straighter than the big bamboo

No ifs

Brothers



No ifs

Judah



No buts

Brothers



No buts

Judah



Benjamin is honest as coconuts

Sure as the tide wash the golden sand

Benjamin is an innocent man

Sure as bananas need the sun

We are the criminal guilty ones



Oh no
