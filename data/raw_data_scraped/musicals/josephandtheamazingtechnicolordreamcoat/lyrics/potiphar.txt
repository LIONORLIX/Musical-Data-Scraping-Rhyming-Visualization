Potiphar


Narrator



Joseph was taken to Egypt in chains and sold,

Where he was bought by a captain named by Potiphar

Narrator & Male Ensemble



Potiphar had very few cares

He was one of Egypt millionaires

Having made a fortune buying shares in

Potiphar



Pyramids

Narrator & Male Ensemble



Potiphar had made a huge pile

Owned a large percentage of the Nile

Potiphar



Meant that I could really live in style

Narrator & Male Ensemble



And he did

Narrator



Joseph was an unimportant

Slave who found he liked his master

Consequently worked much harder

Even with devotion

Potiphar could see tha Joseph

Was a cut above the average

Made him leader of his household

Maximum promotion



Narrator & Male Ensemble



Potiphar was cool and so fine

Potiphar



But my wife would never toe the line

Narrator & Male Ensemble



It's all there in chapter thirty-nine

Of Genesis

She was beautiful but



Mrs. Potiphar



Evil

Narrator & Male Ensemble



Saw a lot of men against his will

He would have to tell her that she still was his

Was his

Narrator



Joseph's looks and handsome figure

Had attracted her attention

Every morning she would beckon

Mrs. Potiphar



Come and lie with me love

Narrator



Joseph wanted to resist her,

Till one day she proved too eager

Joseph cried in vain

Joseph



Please stop

I don't believe in free love

Narrator



Potiphar was counting sheckels

In his den below the bedroom

When he heard a mighty rumpus

Clattering above him

Suddenly he knew his riches

Couldn't buy him what he wanted

Gold would never make him happy

If she didn't love him



Narrator, Ensemble & Children



Letting out a mighty roar

Potiphar burst through the door

Potiphar



Joseph, I'll see you rot in jail

The things that you have done are beyond the pale

Narrator, Ensemble & Children



Poor, poor Joseph, locked up in a cell

Things ain't going well, hey, locked up in a cell

Poor, poor Joseph, locked up in a cell

Things ain't going well, hey, locked up in a cell

Locked up in a cell
