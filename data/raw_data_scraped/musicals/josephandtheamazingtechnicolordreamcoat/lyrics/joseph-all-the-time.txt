Joseph All the Time


Narrator



Joseph knew by this his brothers now were honest men

The time had come at last to reunite them all again



Joseph



Can't you recognise my face? Is it had to see

That Joseph, who you thought was dead, your brother

It's me?



Narrator & Children



Joseph, Joseph, is it really true?

Joseph, Joseph, is it really you?



Narrator, Ensemble & Children



Joseph, Joseph
