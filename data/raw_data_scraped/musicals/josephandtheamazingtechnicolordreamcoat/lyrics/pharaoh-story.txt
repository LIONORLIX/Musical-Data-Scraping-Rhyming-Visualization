Pharaoh Story


Narrator



Pharaoh, he was

A powerful man

With the ancient world

In the palm of his hand

To all intents and purposes he

Was Egypt with a capital E

Whatever he did

He was showered with praise

If he cracked a joke

Then you chortled for days

No-one had rights or a

Vote but the king

In fact you might say

He was fairly right-wing

When Pharaoh's around,

Then you get down on the ground

If you ever find yourself near Ramases

Get down on your knees

A Pharaoh's story,

A Pharaoh's story

A Pharaoh's story,

A Pharaoh's story

Down at the other

End of the scale

Joseph is still

Doing time in jail

For even though he is

In with the guards

A liftime in prison

Seems quite on the cards

But if my analysis of

The position is right

At the end of the tunnel

There's seems a glimmer of light

For all of a sudden

Indescribable things

Have shattered the sleep

Of both peasants and kings

Strange as it seems,

There's been a run of crazy dreams

And a man who can interpret

Could go far - could become a star

Could be famous,

Could be a big success

Could be famous,

Could be a big success

Strange as it seems

There's been a

Run of crazy dreams

And a man who can interpret

Could go far

Could become a star

Could be famous,

Could be a big success

Could be famous,

Could be a big success

Strange as it seems

There's been a

Run of crazy dreams

And a man who can interpret

Could go far



Ah

Could become a star

Could be famous,

Could be a big success

Could be famous,

Could be a star
