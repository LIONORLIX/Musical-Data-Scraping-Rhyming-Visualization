Grovel, Grovel


Joseph



I dreamed that in the fields one day,

The corn gave me sign

Your eleven sheaves of corn

All turned and bowed to mine

I dreamed I saw eleven stars,

The sun the moon and sky

Bowing down before my star,

And now I realise why

How do I know where you came from?

You could be spies

Telling me that you are hungry -

That could be lies

How do I know who you are?

Why do you think I should help you?

Would you help me?

Why on earth should I believe you?

I've no guarantee



Narrator & Brothers



Grovel, grovel, cringe, bow, stoop, fall

Worship, worship, beg, kneel, sponge, crawl

Brothers



We are just eleven brothers,

Good men and true

Though we know we count for nothing

When up next to you

Honesty's are middle name

Life is slowly ebbing from us,

Hope's almost gone

It's getting very hard to see us

From sideways on

Narrator & Brothers



Grovel, grovel, cringe, bow, stoop, fall

Worship, worship, beg, kneel, sponge, crawl

Jospeh



I rather like the way you're talking,

Astute and sincere

Suddenly your tragic story

It gets me right here

Brothers



This is what we hoped he'd say

Jospeh



All this tugging at my heartstrings

Seems quite justified

I shall give you what you came for

And lots more beside

Narrator & Brothers



Grovel, grovel, cringe, bow, stoop, fall

Worship, worship, beg, kneel, sponge, crawl

Brothers



Thank you, thank you, cringe, bow, stoop, fall

Worship, worship, beg, kneel, sponge, crawl

Narrator



Joseph handed them sackloads of food

And they grovelled with base gratitude

Female Ensemble



Then, unseen, Joseph out around the back

And planted a cup in young Benjamin's sack

Narrator



When the brothers were ready to go

Jospeh turned to them all

With a terrible stare and said

Joseph



No No No No No
