Jacob & Sons



Narrator



Way way back many centuries ago,

Not long after the Bible began

Jacob lived in the land of Canaan,

A fine example of a family man.

Jacob, Jacob and sons,

Depended on farming to earn their keep.

Jacob, Jacob and sons,

Spen all of his days in the fields with sheep.

Jacob was the founder of a whole new nation

Thanks to the number of children he had

He was also known as Israel, but most of the time

His sons and his wives used to call him Dad.

Jacob, Jacob and sons,

Men of the soil, of the sheaf and crook

Jacob, Jacob and sons,

A remarkable family in anyone's book.
