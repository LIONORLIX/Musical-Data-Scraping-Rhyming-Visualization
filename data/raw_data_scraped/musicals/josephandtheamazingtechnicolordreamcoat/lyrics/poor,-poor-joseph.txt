Poor, Poor Joseph


Narrator



Next day, far from home,

The brothers planned the repulsive crime

Brothers



Let us grab him now,

Do him in, while weave got the time

Narrator



This they did and made the most of it

Tore his coat and flung him in  pit

Brothers



Let us leave him here,

All alone, and he's bound to die

Narrator



When some Ishmaelites,

A hairy crew, came riding by

In a flash the brothers changed their plan

Brothers



We need cash. Let's sell him if we can

Narrator, Female Ensemble & Children



Poor, poor Joseph, what'cha gonna do?

Things look bad for you, hey, what'cha gonna do?

Poor, poor Joseph, what'cha gonna do?

Things look bad for you, hey, what'cha gonna do?

Brothers



Could you use a slave,

You hairy bunch of Ishmaelites?

Young, strong, well-behaved,

Going cheap and he reads and writes

Narrator



In a trice the dirty deal was done

Silver coins for Jacob's favourite son

Then the Ishmaelites

Galloped off with the slave in tow

Off to Egypt where Joseph was not keen to go

It wouldn't be a picnic he could tell



Joseph



And I don't speak Egyptian very well

Narrator



Joseph's brothers tore

His precious multi-coloured coat

Having ripped it up,

They next attacked a passing goat

Soon the wretched creature was no more

They dipped his coat in blood and guts and gore

Narrator, Ensemble & Children



Oh now brothers, how low can you stoop?

You make a sordid group, hey, how low can you stoop?

Poor, poor Joseph, sold to be a slave

Situation's grave, hey, sold to be a slave
