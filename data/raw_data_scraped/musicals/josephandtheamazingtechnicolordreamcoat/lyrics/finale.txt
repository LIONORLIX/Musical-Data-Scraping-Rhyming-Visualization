Joseph



I closed my eyes, drew back the curtain

To see for certain what I thought I knew

Far far away, someone was weeping

But the world was sleeping

Any dream will do

Joseph & Children



I wore my coat, with golden lining

Bright colours shining, wonderful and new

And in the east, the dawn was breaking

And the world was waking

Any dream will do

Joseph



A crash of drums

Narrator



A flash of light

Joseph



My golden coat flew out of sight

Joseph & Narrator



The colours faded into darkness

I was left alone

Joseph & Narrator & Children



May I return to the beginning

The light is dimming, and the dream is too

The world and I, we are still waiting

Still hesitating, any dream will do

Still hesitating, any dream will do

Full Company



May I return to the beginning

The light is dimming, and the dream is too

The world and I, we are still waiting

Still hesitating, any dream will do

Give me my coloured coat,

My amazing coloured coat

Give me my coloured coat,

My amazing coloured

Coat
