Stone the Crows


Narrator



Pharaoh said -

Pharaoh



Well stone the crows,

This Joseph is a clever kid

Who'd have thought that fourteen cows

Could mean the things he said they did?

Joseph, you must help me further;

I have got a job for you

You shall lead us through this crisis -

You shall be my number two



Narrator & Female Ensemble



Pharaoh told his guards to fetch

A chisel from the local store

Whereupon he ordered them

To cut the chains that Joseph wore

Joseph got a royal pardon

And a host of splendid things

A chariot of gold, a cloak,

A medal and some signet rings



Joseph -

Pharaoh's number two

Joseph -

Egypt looks to you

Egypt looks to you

Seven summers on the trot

Were perfect just as Joseph said

Joseph saw that food was gathered

Ready for the years ahead

Seven years of famine followed

Egypt didn't mind a bit

The first recorded rationing

In history was a hit



Female Ensemble



Joseph how can we ever say

All that we want to about you

We're so glad that you came our way

We would have perished without you

Pharaoh



Joseph we are the perfect team

Old buddies, that's you and me

I was wise to have chosen you

You'll be wise to agree

Female Ensemble



Joseph how can we ever say

All that we want to about you

We're so glad that you came our way

We would have perished without you

Pharaoh



We were in a jam

Would have baffled Abraham

But now we're a partneship

It's just a piece of cake

Female Ensemble



Greatest man since Noah

Only goes to shoah

Joseph



Anyone from anywhere can make it

If they get a lucky break

Narrator & Female Ensemble



This could be a happy ending,

Perfect place to stop the show

Joseph after all has gone

About as far as he can go

But I'm sure that Jacob and

His other sons have crossed your mind

How had famine hit the family

Joseph left behind?
