One More Angel in Heaven


Reuben



Father we've something to tell you, a story of our time

A tragic but inspiring tale of manhood in its prime

You know you had a dozen sons -

Well now that's not quite true

But feel no sorrow, do not grieve,

He would not want you to

Reuben, Reuben's Wife & Male Ensemble



There's one more angel in heaven

There's one more star in the sky

Joseph we'll never forget you

It's tough but we're gonna get by

There's one less place a our table

There's one more tear in my eye

Brothers



But Joseph the things that you stood for

Reuben



Like peace and love never die

When I think of his last great battle

A lump comes to my throat

It takes a man who knows no fear

To wrestle with a goat

His blood-stained coat is tribute to

His final sacrifice

His body may be past its peak

But his soul's in paradise



Jacob



There's one less place a our table

There's one more tear in my eye

Brothers



But Joseph the things that you stood for

Reuben



Like truth and light never die

Brothers



Carve his name with pride and courage

Naphtali



Let no tear be shed

Brothers



If he had not laid down his life

We all would now be dead
