Pharaoh's Dreams Explained


Joseph



Seven years of bumper crops are on their way

Years of plenty, endless wheat and toms of hay

Your farms will boom, there won't be room

To store the surplus food you grow

After that, the future doesn't look so bright

Egypt's luck will change completely overnight

And famine's hand will stalk the land

With food an all-time low

Noble king, there is no doubt

What your dreams are all about

All these things you saw in your pyjamas

Are a long-range forecast for your farmers

Joseph, Female Ensemble & Children



And I'm sure it's crossed your mind

What it is you have to find

Find a man to lead you through the famine

With a flair for economic planning

But who this man could be

I just don't know

Who this man could be

I just don't know

Who this man could be

I just don't know
