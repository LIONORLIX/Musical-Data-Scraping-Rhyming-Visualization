Song of the King (Seven Fat Cows)


Pharaoh & Ensemble



Well I was wandering along by the banks of the river

When seven fat cows came up out of the Nile, uh-huh

And right behind these fine healthy animals came

Seve other cows, skinny and vile, uh-huh

Well the thin cows ate the fat cows which I

Thought would do them good, uh-huh

But it didn't make them fatter like such

A monster supper should



Well the thin cows were as thin

As they had ever, ever, ever been

Well this dream has got me baffled

Hey, Joseph, won't you tell me what it means?



Well you know that kings ain't stupid

But I don't have a clue

So don't be cruel Joseph

Help me I beg of you



Well I was standing doing nothing in a field out of town

Whe I saw seven beautiful ears of corn, uh-huh

They were ripe, they were golden and

You've guessed it,

Right behind them came seven other ears

Tattered and torn, uh-huh



Well the bad corn ate the good corn

They came up from behind yes they did

Now Joseph here's the punch line

It's really gonna blow your mind



Well the bad corn was

As bad as it had ever, ever, ever been

Well this dream has got me all shook up

Treat me nice and tell me what it means



Hey, hey, hey Joseph

Won't you tell poor old Pharaoh

What does this crazy dream mean?

Oh yeah
