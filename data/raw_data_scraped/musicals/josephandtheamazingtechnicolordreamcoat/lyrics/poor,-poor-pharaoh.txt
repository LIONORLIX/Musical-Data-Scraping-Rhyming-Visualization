Poor, Poor Pharaoh


Narrator



Guess what? In his bed Pharaoh

Had an uneasy night

He had had a dream that pinned him

To his sheets with fright

No-one knew the meaning of this dream

What to do, ehatever could it mean?

Then his buttler said



Buttler



I know of a bloke in jail

Who is hot on dreams,

Could explain old Pharaoh's tale

Narrator



Pharaoh said

Pharaoh



Well fetch this Joseph man

I need him to help me if he can

Narrator & Ensemble



Poor, poor Pharaoh,

What'cha gonna do

Dreams are hanting you, hey,

What'cha gonna do

Narrator



Chained and bound, afraid, alone

Joseph stood before the throne

Joseph



My service to Pharaoh has begun

Tell me your problems, mighty one
