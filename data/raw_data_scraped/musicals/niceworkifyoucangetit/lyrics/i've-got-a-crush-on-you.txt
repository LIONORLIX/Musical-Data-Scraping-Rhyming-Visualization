I've Got a Crush on You


How glad a million laddies

From millionaires to caddies,

Would be,

To capture me.



But you had such persistence

You wore down my resistance;

I fell --

And it was swell.

You're my big and brave and handsome romeo.

How you won me I shall never, never know.



It's not that you're attractive --

But oh, my heart grew active

When you

Came into view ...



You've got a crush on me, sweetie pie.

All the day and nighttime, hear you sigh.

I never had the least notion

That you could fall with so much emotion.



Could you coo, could you care

For a cunning cottage we could share?

The world will pardon your mush

'cause you've got a crush,

My baby, on me!
