Do, Do, Do


I remember the bliss

Of that wonderful kiss

I knew that a boy

Could never have more joy

From any little miss.



I remember it quite

'twas a wonderful night.

Oh, how I'd adore it

If you would encore it.



Do, do, do

What you've done, done, done

Before, baby.

Do, do, do

What I do, do, do

Adore, baby.



Let's try again,

Sigh again

Fly again to heaven.

Baby, see,

It's a b c --

I love you and you love me.



I know, know, know

What a beau, beau, beau

Should do, baby;

So don't, don't, don't

Say it won't, won't, won't

Come true, baby.

My heart begins to hum --

Dum de dum de dum-dum-dum,

So do, do, do

What you've done, done, done

Before.



You dear, dear, dear

Little dear, dear, dear

Come here --

Snappy!



And see, see, see

Little me, me, me make you

Happy!



My heart begins to sigh --

Di de di de di-di-di

So do, do, do

What you've done, done, done

Before.
