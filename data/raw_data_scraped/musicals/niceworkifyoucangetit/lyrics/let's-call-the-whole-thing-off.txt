Let's Call the Whole Thing Off


You say either and I say either,

You say neither and I say neither

Either, either

Neither, neither

Let's call the whole thing off.



You like potato and I like... potahto?

You like tomato and I like tomahto

Potato, potahto,

Tomato, tomahto.

Let's call the whole thing off



But oh, if we call the whole thing off

Then we must part;

And oh, if we ever part, then that might break my heart.



So if you like pajamas and I like pajahmas,

I'll wear pajamas and give up pajahmas;

For we know we need each other so we

Better call the calling off off,

Let's call the whole thing off.



She says laughter and you say laughter

You say after and he says aufter

Laughter, laughter

After aufter

Let's call the whole thing off.



I like vanilla and you like vanella

You sarsaparilla, and I sarsaparella

Vanilla, vanella

Chocolate strawberry

Let's call the whole thing off.



But oh if you call the whole thing off then you must part

And oh, if you ever part, then that might break my heart



So if you go for oysters and I go for ersters

I'll order oysters and cancel the ersters

For you know you need each other so you

Better call the calling off off,

Let's call the whole thing off.
