Sweet and Lowdown (Reprise)


[Cookie] (simultaneously)

My advice is,

Grab a cab and go

Where the band is playing;

Milk and honey flow

Everyone is saying:

"Blow, that sweet and low-down"!

Low-down!



Four quarter!

Four-quarter!

Four-quarter!

Four-quarter!

Four-quarter time!



By jo, by jing!

Zing!

Ha-cha-cha-cha-cha!

Ha-cha-cha-cha!

Go on and blow,

That sweet and lowdown

Lowdown, lowdown, lowdown, lowdown, lowdown

Grab a cab and go

Where the band is playing;

Milk and honey flow

Everyone is saying!
