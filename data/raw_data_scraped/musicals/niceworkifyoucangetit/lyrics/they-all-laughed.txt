They All Laughed


They all laughed at Christopher Columbus

When he said the world was round;

They all laughed when Edison recorded sound.



They all laughed at Wilbur and his brother

When they said that man could fly;

They told Marconi

Wireless was phony --

It's the same old cry!



They laughed at me wanting you,

Said I was reaching for the moon;

But oh, you came through

Now they'll have to change their tune.



They all said we never could be happy,

They laughed at us -- and how!

But ho, ho, ho --

Who's got the last laugh now.



They all laughed at Fulton and his steamboat

Hershey and his choc'late bar.

Ford and his Lizze

Kept the laughers busy --

That's how people are!



They laughed at me wanting you --

Said it would be hello! Goodbye!

But oh, you came through --

Now they're eating humble pie.



They all said we'd never get together --

Darling, let's take a bow,

For ho, ho, ho

Who's got the last laugh now



Just imagine someone,

Waiting at the cottage door.

Where two hearts become one

Who could ask for anything more.



Loving one who loves you

and then taking that bow



It's nice work if you can get it

And if you get it,

Won't you tell me how!



Who's got the last laugh now!
