I've Got to Be There


[Jimmy]

When I keep seeing things and going places,

My life has color;

Without new songs,

Without new friends and faces,

'Twould be much duller.



Whenever people step up

To say, "let's step tonight,"

If I've been low, I pep up;

Again the future's bright!

Whenever there's a party I can go to

It makes the world seem right!



When music is playing

And couples are swaying --

Say! I've got to be there!

I've got to be there!



When joy's in the making

And ceilings are shaking

And there's never a care --

I've got to be there!



Check my hat

And throw the stub away!

I'm a lamb

Who's gone astray!



When bottles are popping

And dignity's dropping

And the women are fair --

I've got to be there!



I've got to be there!

I've got to be there!



When bottles are popping

And dignity's dropping

And the women are fair --

I've got to be there!



[Chorus]

Check his hat, just his hat

And throw the stub away!

He's a lamb, just a little lamb

Who's gone astray!



[Jimmy]

When bottles are popping

And dignity's dropping

And the women are fair --

I've got to be there!

I've got to be there!

I've got to be there!

I've got to be there!
