Demon Rum


Demon rum,

We'll efface you!

Demon rum,

You disgrace, you!

You're an evil too many men crave!



Devil's brew!

Satan's nectar!

Soon shall you

Be a specter!

For we're digging your liquory grave!



Down with sin

Alcohol we'll throttle!

When we win

The battle of the bottle!

Demon rum

You're a goner!

Demon rum,

On my honor --

Lips that taste of wine

Shall never touch mine!



Down with demon rum!
