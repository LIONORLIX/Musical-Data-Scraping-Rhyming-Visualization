By Strauss


[Estonia]

Away with the music of Broadway!

Be off with your Irving Berlin!

Oh, I'd give no quarter

To Kern or Cole Porter,

And Gershwin keeps pounding on tin.



How can I be civil

When hearing this drivel?

It's only for nightclubbing souses.

Oh, give me the free'n'easy

Waltz that is Viennesey --



And, go tell the band

If they want a hand,

The waltz must be Strauss's.

Ya, ya, ya -- give me oom-pah-pah!



When I want a melody

Lilting through the house,

Then I want a melody

By Strauss.

It laughs! It sings! The world is in rhyme,

Swinging to three-quarter time.



Let the Danube flow along,

And the Fledermaus!

Keep the wine and give me song

By Strauss!

By jo, by jing!

By Strauss is the thing!

So I say to ha-cha-cha

Heruas!

Just give me an oom-pah-pah

By Strauss!



[Cookie]

Grab a cab and go down

To where the band is playing;

Where milk and honey flow down

Where ev'ry one is saying:

"Blow that sweet and low-down!"



Come along, get in it --

You'll love the syncopation!

The minute they begin it,

You're shouting to the nation:

"Blow --"



[Estonia]

How can I be civil

When hearing this drivel?

It's only for nightclubbing souses.

Oh, give me the free'n'easy

Waltz that is Viennesey --



[Estonia] (simultaneously)

When I want a melody

Lifting through the house,

Then I want a melody

By Strauss.

It laughs! It sings! The world is in rhyme,



Swinging to three-quarter t--

Swinging to three-quarter t--

Three-quarter!

Three-quarter!

Swinging to three-quarter time!



By jo, by jing!

By Strauss is the thing!

So I say to ha-cha-cha

Heruas!

Just give me an oom-pah-pah

By Strauss!

By Strauss!

By Strauss!

By Strauss!
