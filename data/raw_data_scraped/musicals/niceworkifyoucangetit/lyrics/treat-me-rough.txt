Treat Me Rough


Treat me rough,

Muss my hair,

Don't you dare to handle me with care.

I'm no innocent child, baby,

Keep on treating me wild.



Treat me rough,

Pinch my cheek,

Kiss and hug and squeeze me,

`Till I'm weak.



I've been pampered enough, baby

Keep on treatin' me rough



Treat me rough,

Pinch my cheek,

Kiss and hug and squeeze me,

`Till I'm weak.



I've been pampered enough, baby

Keep on treatin' me rough,

rough, rough, rough,

Keep on treatin' me-

Keep on treatin' me rough.
