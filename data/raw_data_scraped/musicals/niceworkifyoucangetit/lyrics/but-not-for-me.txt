But Not for Me


Old Man Sunshine, listen, you,

Never tell me dreams come true,

Just try it, and I'll start a riot,

Beatrice Fairfax don't you dare,

Ever tell me he will care,

I'm certain, It's the final curtain.



Don't want to hear from and cheerful Pollyannas,

Who'll tell you fate supplies a mate, it's all bananas.



They're writing songs of love, but not for me,

A lucky star's above, but not for me,

With love to lead the way,

I found more clouds of grey,

Than any Russian play could guarantee.



I was a fool to fall, and get that way,

Hi ho! Alas! And also Lack-a-day!

Although I can't dismiss,

The memory of his kiss,

I guess he's not for me.



I know that love's a game,

I'm puzzled just the same,

Was I the moth or flame?

I'm all at sea.



It started off so swell,

This "let's pretend",

It all began so well,

But what an end.



The climax of the plot,

Should be the marriage knot,

But there's no knot for me.
