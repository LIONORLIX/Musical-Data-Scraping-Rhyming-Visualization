I've Got to Be There (Reprise)


When music is playing

And couples are swaying --

Say! I've got to be there!

I've got to be there!



When joy's in the making

And ceilings are shaking

And there's never a care --

I've got to be there!



Check my hat

And throw the stub away!

I'm a lamb

Who's gone astray!



When bottles are popping

And dignity's dropping

And the women are fair --

We've got to be there!



We've got to be there!

You've got to be there!

You've got to be there!
