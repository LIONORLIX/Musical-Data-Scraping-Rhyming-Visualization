Will You Remember Me?


[Billie]

When I go my way,

Along some highway,

Will you remember me?



When you are lonesome,

I'd like to own some

Place in your memory.



I know that you'll play a part

In my heart when I start;

That's something I can guarantee.



But when I stray off,

Somewhere away off --

Will you remember me?



[Jimmy]

Now that I am starting,

I cannot deny,

I'd prefer a 'see you later'

To a mere goodbye.



But before departing

Do I hope in vain?

Something makes me wonder whether

You'll forget me altogether

If we never meet again.



[Jimmy] (simultaneously)

When you go your way

Out through my doorway

Will you remember me?



When you are lonesome,

I'd like to own some

Place in your memory.



But when you stray off,

Somewhere away off --

Will you remember me?



[Billie] (simultaneously)

Will you remember me?



When you're alone,

I'd like to own some

Place in your memory.



I know that you'll play a part

In my heart when I start;

That's something I can guarantee.



But when I stray off,

Somewhere away off --

Will you remember me?



Will you remember me?
