S Wonderful


Life has just begun;

Jack has found his Jill;

Don't know what you've done,

But I'm all a-thrill.



How can words express

Your divine appeal?

You can never guess

All the love I feel.

From now on, lady, I insist,

For me no other girls exist.



'S wonderful! 'S marvelous --

You should care for me!

'S awful nice! 'S paradise --

'S what I love to see!



You've made my life so glamorous,

You can't blame me for feeling amorous.

Oh, 'S wonderful! 'S marvelous --

That you should care for me!



Don't mind telling you

In my humble fash

That you thrill me through

With a tender pash.

When you said you care

'Magine my emosh;

I swore, then and there,

Permanent devosh.

You made all other boys seem blah;

Just you alone filled me with ahh!



Oh, 'S wonderful! 'S marvelous --

You should care for me!

'S awful nice! 'S paradise!

'S what I love to see!



My dear, it's four-leaf clover time

From now on my heart's working overtime

Oh! 'S wonderful! 'S marvelous!

That you should care for me!



You've made my life so glamorous,

You can't blame me for feeling amorous.

'S wonderful! 'S marvelous --

That you should care for--
