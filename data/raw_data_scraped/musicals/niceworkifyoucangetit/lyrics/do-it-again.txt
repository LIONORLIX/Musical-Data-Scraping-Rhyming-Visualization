JEANNIE:

Tell me tell me,

what did ya do to me.



DUKE:

Nothin'!



JEANNIE:

I just got a thrill,

that was new to me.

When your two lips,

were pressed to mine.



DUKE:

No! But, you... YOU!



JEANNIE:

When you held me,

I wasn't snugglin'.

You should know,

I really was strugglin'.



DUKE: (whisper)

No you weren't!



JEANNIE:

I've only met you,

and I shouldn't let you.

But oooooh,

JEANNIE:

I may say no, no, no, no, no,

but, do it again.



DUKE:

JEANNIE:

My lips just ache,

to have you take,

the kiss that waiting for you.

You know if you do,

You...

Won't regret it,

come and get it.



Oooooh,

I may cry oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

but no one will hear.

Mama may scold me,

'cuz she told me it is naughty, but then.

Oh do it again,
