Lady Be Good


Listen to my tale of woe,

it's terribly sad but true,

All dressed up, no place to go

Each ev'ning I'm awf'ly blue.



I must win some handsome guy

Can't go on like this,

I could blossom out I know,

With somebody just like you. So...



Oh, sweet and lovely lady, be good

Oh, lady, be good to me

I am so awf'ly misunderstood

So lady, be good to me



Oh, please have some pity

I'm all alone in this big city



I tell you I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood,

So lady be good to me.



Oh, please have some pity

I'm all alone in this big city



I tell you I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood,

So lady be good to me.



Oh lady be good to me.
