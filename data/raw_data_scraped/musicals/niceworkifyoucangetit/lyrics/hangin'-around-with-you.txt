Hangin' Around With You


What's the use of hangin' around with you,

Hangin' around with you,

Hangin' around with you, dearie.

I never know,

I never know just where I stand!



What's the use of bangin' around with you,

Bangin' around with you,

Bangin' around with you, dearie.

You got to give,

This little girl a bigger hand.



You're not acting the beau,

That I once used to know.

I'm beginning to see,

That I'm likely to be,

On the shelf



If you want me hangin' around with you,

Hangin' around with you,

Hangin' around with you, dearie

You got to learn,

You got to learn to be yourself!
