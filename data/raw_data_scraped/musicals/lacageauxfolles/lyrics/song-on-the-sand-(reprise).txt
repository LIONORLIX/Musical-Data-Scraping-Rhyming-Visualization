Song On The Sand (Reprise)


Something about sharing

Something about always



Though the years race along

I still think of our song on the sand

And I still try and search for the words

I can barely remember



Though the time tumbles by

There is one thing

That I am forever certain of



I hear

La, da da da, da da da

Da da, da da da da

And I'm young and in love
