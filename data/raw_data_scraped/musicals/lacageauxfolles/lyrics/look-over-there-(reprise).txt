Look Over There (Reprise)


How often is someone concerned

With the tiniest thread of your life?

Concerned with whatever you feel

And whatever you touch?



Look over there

Look over there

Somebody cares that much



So count all the loves who will love you

From now till the end of your life

And when you have added the loves

Who have loved me before



Look over there

Look over there

Somebody loves you more
