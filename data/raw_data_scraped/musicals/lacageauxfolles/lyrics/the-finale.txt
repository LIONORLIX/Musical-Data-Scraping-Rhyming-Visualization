The Finale


Georges:

[speaking]

And so my friends, once again the inevitable is upon us.

It is time for us to end our little show, time for all

the pieces that have flown apart to come together.

And if we have done our job correctly, you will leave

with more than a folded program and a ticket stub...

Messieurs-dames! La Cage Aux Folles presents our Finale,

bringing our own golden butterflies from the garden of

delight for your delectation. And as an extra surprise...

Ladies and Gentlemen...Are you ready?



[singing]

Maestro, if you please!!

Ahaa Ahaa! Ahaa Ahaa!

Ahaa Ahaa! Ahaa Ahaa!

Georges:

Life is a celebration with you on my arm.

Walking's a new sensation with you on my arm.

Each time I face a morning that's boring and bland,

With you it looks good, with you it looks great,

With you it looks grand!

Chorus:

With you it looks grand!

Georges:

Somehow, you've put a permanent star in my eye.

Chorus:

Somehow, you've put a permanent star in my eye.

Georges:

Even the dead of Winter can feel like July.

Chorus:

Even the dead of Winter can feel like July.

Georges and Chorus:

I found a combination that works like a charm:

It's suddenly "oo"

It's suddenly "la"

Whenever it's you

It's you,

It's you,

It's you...



ALL:

La la la la la la la la la la

La la la la la la la la la la

La la la la la la la la la la

La la la la la la la la la la

La la la la la la la la la la

La la la la la la la la la la

La la la la la la la la la la

La la la la la



You go alone to have the evening of your life.

You meet your mistress, and your boy-friend, and your wife.

The joy's contagious, you can bring your whole

Outrageous entourage - Outrageous entourage - Outrageous entourage

Outrageous Entourage!

It's hot and hectic, effervescent and eclectic

At La Cage Aux Folles.

Albin:

Though the time tumbles by,

There is one thing that I am forever

Certain of...

I hear

La da da da da da da da da da

Georges:

La da da da da da da da da da

Albin and Georges:

And I'm young and in love...



All:

The best of times is now.

What's left of Summer

But a faded rose?

The best of times is now.

As for tomorrow,

Well, who knows? Who knows? Who knows?

So hold this moment fast,

And live and love

As hard as you know how.

And make this moment last,

Because the best of times is now,

Is now, is now.

Now, not some forgotten yesterday.

Now, tomorrow is too far away.

So hold this moment fast,



[Clapping hands]



And live and love

As hard as you know how.

And make this moment last,

Because the best of times is now, is now.

So hold this moment fast,

And live and love

As hard as you know how.

And make this moment last,

Because the best of times is now,

Is now, is now

Is now, is NOW!
