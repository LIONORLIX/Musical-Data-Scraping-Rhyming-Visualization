Memphis Lives in Me


There's a town that I call home

Where all the streets are paved with soul.

Down on Beale, there's a honkey-tonk bar,

Hear the wail of a blues guitar,

Have a beer and drop a dime

In a blindman's jar.

The blues sing softly in the air,

Like a Sunday morning prayer-

Just one more drink and you'll see God everywhere.

Like a sad old melody-

Tears you up but sets you free-

That's how Memphis lives in me.

There comes a time when muddy waters run rough.

There comes a point when a man has had enough.

Like a friend who always stands by me,

Memphis knows me, Memphis shows me

How this life just has to be.

I couldn't even try to run away, say goodbye.

Here I was born, and here is where I'll die.

Just a man from Tennessee can't be what I can't be

All I know is Memphis lives in me.

Whoa!

There comes a time when muddy waters run rough.

There comes a point when a man has had enough.

Like a friend who always stands by me,

Memphis knows me, Memphis shows me

How this life just has to be

I couldn't even try to run away, say goodbye

Here I was born and here is where I'll die!

Just a man from Tennessee, can't be what I can't be

All I know is Memphis lives, all I know is Memphis gives,

All I know is Memphis lives in me!
