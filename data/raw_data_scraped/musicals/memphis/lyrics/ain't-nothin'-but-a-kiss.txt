Ain't Nothin' But a Kiss


FELICIA:

You're a dog, and baby I'm dog-tired!

You're a drug, the kind that gets me wired.

I should say goodnight but you got me all inspired!

Ain't nothin' but a kiss that sets a girl on fire.

A simple little kiss, all lipstick and desire.

Take a taste of this, ain't nothin' but a kiss.

Oh what could be the harm, if I fall for your charm?

Just one little peck on your sweet little neck.

Under your spell, under your command-

You got me eatin' outta your hand!

There are worse things I could do-

And I wanna do them all to you!

Ain't nothin' but a kiss

And then I'll shut the door!

A simple little kiss,

But next time, you'll get more!

Can you handle this? Can you handle this?

Try and handle this- ain't nothin' but a kiss!
