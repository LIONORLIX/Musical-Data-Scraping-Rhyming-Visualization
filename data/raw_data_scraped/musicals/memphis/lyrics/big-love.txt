Big Love


BOBBY:

Some people say I'm just a fool, a man with nothin' to show.

They say I got the charm of a mule,

But there's something them people don't know.

If they could just see deep inside,

They'd see that my heart can sing.

I got my soul and I got my pride,

And I got me one other thing-

Open your eyes I got a surprise!

We'll be a rockin' and a rollin' till we see the sun rise!

Like Romeo, I'll take you places you never go!

Call me Big Daddy! 'Cause Big Daddy got big love!

All the pretty boys wanna get their kicks!

But I'm the city boy who gets all the chicks!

I think you'll dig the part of me that's big!

Call me Big Daddy, 'cause Big Daddy got big love!

Call me Big Daddy-

You'll flip your wig for Big Daddy!

Take a swig of Big Daddy

'Cause Big Daddy got big love!
