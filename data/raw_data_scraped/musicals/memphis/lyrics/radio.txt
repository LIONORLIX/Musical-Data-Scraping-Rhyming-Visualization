Radio


HUEY:

How many times did I hear it? How many times did they try?

To somehow break my spirit, to somehow make me die.

"Huey, you're odd, crazy and slow. Now much to look at-"

Well, maybe that's so. They tried so hard to drag me down low,

They didn't count on/count on-

The radio! The radio!

I knew it could teach!, I knew it could preach,

I knew it could reach across the air!

I knew it could sell, I knew it could yell,

I knew it could tell the truth out there!

Not bad for a backward hick! Not bad for a country kid!

Not a bad little ol' trick to do all that I did!



COMPANY:

We love when it sings, we love when it swings!



HUEY:

I love when it brings my soul to you!



COMPANY:

We love when it hops, we love when it bops!

The ride never stops, just feel it come through!



HUEY:

So turn the volume up now! Let the music have it's say!

Ain't no use holdin' back-

The rhythm's gonna get you, the rhythm's gonna get you,

The rhythm's gonna get you anyway!



COMPANY:

We use it to jive, we use it to thrive!



HUEY:

And I came alive on the/ on the radio!

The radio!
