Change Don't Come Easy


MAMA:

Yeah, I went to their church and heard them people pray and chant,

And you was right 'bout one thing Huey-

Colored folk sing like white people can't!

He told us to pray some, he told us to sway some,

He told us the good Lord made us equal inside.

He told us we were sinners, told us we were winners,

He told us to change or our spirits will die.

But change don't come easy, you gotta believe me

It ain't gonna happen overnight.

Change don't come quickly, no, not partick'ly,

It takes time to make all the wrongs right.

He said change don't come easy.



DELRAY/GATOR/BOBBY:

No, don't come easy.



MAMA:

Change never comes easy.



TRIO:

Never comes easy.



MAMA:

I was taught to hate them, was taught to denigrate them,

I was taught they were lesser in the good Lord's eyes.

Can't drink from the same fountain.

I'll scream it from the mountain!

I'm through with buyin' their blasphemous lies!

But change don't come easy, you better believe me!

That is somethin' that you just can't refute.

Change don't come quickly, no, not partick'ly,

So get in their and put on that suit!

I said change don't come easy-



TRIO:

Listen to your Mama!



MAMA:

Change never comes easy-



TRIO:

So stop with all the drama!



MAMA:

(Spoken: Now I'm talkin' to you.)

My boy loves your sister, we both know that, mister,

That ain't no temporary phase.

"Cause my boy is stupid, he's been shot by cupid

So we gotta change our intolerant ways.

The Reverend helped me find my way

To carry on and pray that there's a better day!

So won't you come join me! You gotta come join me!

Join me as I testify!



TRIO:

Yeah!



MAMA:

Woo! Gotta electrify!



GATOR:

Electrify!



MAMA:

Gonna mystify!



BOBBY:

Mystify!



MAMA:

We gonna glorify!



GATOR/BOBBY:

Glorify!



MAMA:

You know I want to prettify!



DELRAY:

Prettify!



MAMA:

It's all about do or die!



TRIO:

Do or die!



MAMA:

Come on, everybody-justify!



TRIO:

Justify!



MAMA:

Hear my battle cry!



TRIO:

Battle cry!



MAMA:

Easy as apple pie!



TRIO:

Apple pie!



MAMA:

Ooh! I gotta testify!



MAMA/TRIO:

Change don't come easy!
