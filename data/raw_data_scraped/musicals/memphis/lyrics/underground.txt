Underground


DELRAY:

It's time to lose the day, it's time to head to Beale,

Where the rhythm is hot, and the music is real.

You can do without love, swear off the booze,

But everyone alive needs to sing the blues.

So time to raise some hell and get on down.



COMPANY:

We goin' down, down underground

(down under, down down under),

We goin' down, down, down, just to hear that sound (down underground, down under).

We're gonna dance so close feel my breath on your skin.



DELRAY:

It ain't quite heaven, but the closest I been.



COMPANY:

We goin' down, down underground.



DELRAY:

First we heard it in church (baby), then we added some gin (yeah, yeah).

Then we took it down here (then we took it down here) and added soul with sin.

Gonna jump and jive like a demon possessed.

The devil's in the music, the music is blest.

We goin' down where paradise is found.



COMPANY:

We goin' down, down underground

(down under, down down under),

We goin' down, down, down, just to burn that sound

(down underground, down under).

We gonna do some things that you never dared!



DELRAY:

Ain't no white folks here, cause they too damn scared!



COMPANY:

We goin' down, down underground.



FELICIA:

My brother runs my life, my brother owns this bar,

He won't let me be till he makes me a star!

He gives me this mic, makes me sing all I can,

Just can't have no fun or talk to no man.

Wanna paint the town but with him

Ain't no foolin' around.



COMPANY:

We goin' down, down underground

(down under, down down under),

We goin' down, down, down, just to hear that sound

(down underground, down under).

Gonna grope and grind, gonna hold on tight.



FELICIA:

Find true love at least for tonight.



COMPANY:

We goin' down, down, underground.



DELRAY:

It's a revolution of the heart and soul!



FELICIA:

It's here to stay, ain't never gonna go!



DELRAY:

It's a rebel cry that's outta control!



DELRAY AND FELICIA:

It's the birth of rock and roll!

(rock and roll, rock and roll, rock and roll!)



COMPANY:

We goin' down, down underground

(down under, down down under),

We goin' down, down, down, gotta rock that sound

(down underground, down under)!

We gonna dance and drink till the whiskey's all gone.



FELICIA:

And pray that the preacher forgives us at dawn!



COMPANY:

We goin' down, down underground!



FELICIA:

We're goin' underground!

Oh, we're goin' underground!

Down!
