She's My Sister


DELRAY:

Now I didn't mean to call you a redneck-son-of-a-,

bitch

Though you are a redneck-son-of-a-bitch.

I know you didn't mean to call my club a crappy little club,

Though I guess it is a crappy little club.

My parents died young, they died poor.

They left me with my sister not much more.

She had this voice like none I knew,

So I opened up my club, what else could I do?

For my sister. My little sister.

She sang her song and they customers came-



HUEY:

I came from nothin'.



DELRAY:

We made some money and I made me a name!



HUEY:

I'll make her somethin'.



DELRAY:

You are stealing this music-



HUEY:

That ain't for you to say!



DELRAY:

Hey, I don't blame ya, brother, it's the American way!



HUEY:

No, no, there's something you just don't understand!



DELRAY:

Oh yeah, I understand you're a dangerous man!



HUEY:

I love your sister, really I do.



DELRAY:

Don't ever let me hear those words come out of you!

Not here in Memphis-

The danger is deep that you wanna put her in,

I don't care about you but she's my sister!

I'm a God-fearing man, a Christian through and through,

But you can bet I'll protect my baby sister!

Oh-oh-oh, she's my one and only flesh and blood!

Be careful with the one I love!

She's my sister!
