Tear the House Down


HUEY:

There's a party goin' on in the basement!

A party goin' on on the roof!

The kids are all psyched, the punch is all spiked,

And even the water is one hundred proof!

We're gonna tear!



COMPANY:

Tear!



HUEY:

Tear down the house!

We're gonna stomp!



COMPANY:

Stomp!



HUEY:

Stomp on the floor!

We're gonna have us some fun and when we're all done

We're gonna have us just a little bit more!

We're gonna tear!



COMPANY:

Tear!



HUEY:

Tear down the house!

We're gonna stomp!



COMPANY:

Stomp!



HUEY:

Stomp on the floor!

Gonna have us some fun and when we're all done

We're gonna have us just a little bit more!
