Someday


FELICIA AND BACK-UP SINGERS:

Someday I'm gonna do you wrong.

Someday I'll leave you blue.

Someday I'm gonna steal your heart.

Someday I'll rip it right in two.

But someday just ain't here yet,

And I'm still stuck on you,

So let's just say we got today and do what lovers do.

Some night I'm gonna hurt ya bad.

Some night I'll cause you pain.

Some night I'm gonna leave you dry n' cryin' in the rain.

But some night, just ain't here yet,

And boy you're lookin' good,

So let's pretend tonight won't end and act like lovers should.

Someday I'm gonna do you wrong.

Someday I'll leave you blue.

Someday I'm gonna steal your heart.

Someday I'll rip it right in two.

But someday just ain't here yet and I'm still stuck on you,

So let's just say we got today,

Let's just say we got today,

Let's just say we got today and do what lovers do!
