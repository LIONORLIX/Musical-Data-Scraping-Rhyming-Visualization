Land of Lola


Leave expectations at the door

Just let your eyes explore

My cinematic flair

From my boot to derri√®re



I've got a lacy silken feel

With arms as hard as steel

I am freedom, I'm constriction

A potpourri of contradiction



Leave that hum-drum place of glum behind

Once you walk inside these doors you're mine

Now let me blow your mind.



And like shazam

And bam

Here I am

Yes, ma'am

I'm Lola



And like Je suis

Ooh-wee

That's me

Ebony

I am Lola



(Step in) Step in to a dream

(Where glam) Glamour is extreme

(Welcome) Welcome to my fantasy

We give good epiphany

So come and take my hand

Welcome to the land of Lola



Spoken:

No need to be embarrassed. I like being looked



at. And you like to look. I know a way to make



us both happy.



Lola, Lola, Lola



Got Ginger Rogers' savoir faire

With the moves of Fred Astaire

I'm black Jesus, I'm black Mary

But this Mary's legs are hairy



I'm your coco butter bitch

Not just cookie cutter kitsch

I provide the unexpected

with a prize that's undetected



Let Lola lift you to your highest highs

Let's explore your flight of fancy tonight

I'm / She's gonna treat you right



And like shazam

And bam

Here I am

Yes, ma'am

I'm Lola



And like Je suis

Ooh-wee

That's me

Ebony

I am Lola



(Step in) Step in to a dream

(Where glam) Glamour is extreme

(Welcome) Welcome to my fantasy

We give good epiphany



(Step in) Step in to a dream

(Where glam) Glamour is extreme

(Welcome) Welcome to my fantasy

We give good epiphany



So come and take my hand

Welcome to the land of



Lola

Lola

Lola

Lola



So come and take my hand

Welcome to the land of

Lola
