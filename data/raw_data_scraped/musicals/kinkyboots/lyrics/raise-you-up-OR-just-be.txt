Raise You Up / Just Be


Once I was afraid, but then you came along.

Put your faith in me and I was challenged to be strong.

When I lost my way, you were there to see me through.

Now let Lola lend some love and do the same for you!

Feed your fire, to take you higher.

We’ll light you up like a live wire.

Celebrate you, to elevate you,

when you struggle to step, we’ll take a helping hand.

If you hit the dust,

Let me raise you up.

When your bubble busts,

Let me raise you up.

If your glitter rusts,

Let me raise you up. (and up)

Raise you up

Raise you up

Raise you up.

Never put much heart in anything before.

You strut into my life and help me go for something more.

Now I stand up for myself.

Now I stand out from the crowd.

Now I’m standing on high heels,

If Dad could see me now!

Feed your fire, to take you higher.

We’ll light you up like a live wire.

Celebrate you, to elevate you,

when you struggle to step, we’ll take a helping hand.

If you hit the dust,

Let me raise you up.

When your bubble busts,

Let me raise you up.

If your glitter rusts,

Let me raise you up. (and up)

Raise you up

Raise you up

Raise you up.

I knew you had it in you

I knew what you could tell.

You believed in me,

Let me be right for you.

Your stumbling days are done,

Now we’re walking on air.

I was a loose shoe but you need two to make a pair.

Wait wait wait wait hold it right there buster. Are you saying you’d like to take me out?

Yes.

Are you saying you are Nikola are through?

Yes.

Are you saying you are actually available?

Yes.

And you still like girls?

Yes!

Oh. Carry on!

Feed your fire, to take you higher.

We’ll light you up like a live wire.

Celebrate you, to elevate you,

when you struggle to step, we’ll take a helping hand.

Look out below,

Here come Don, and Don has brought some friends along.

When you start things out of certainty,

Then the ones you love

Are gonna set you free!

Feed your fire, to take you higher.

We’ll light you up like a live wire.

Celebrate you, to elevate you,

when you struggle to step, we’ll take a helping hand.

If you hit the dust,

Let me raise you up.

When your bubble busts,

Let me raise you up.

If your glitter rusts,

Let me raise you up. (and up)

Raise you up

Raise you up

If you hit the dust,

Let me raise you up.

When your bubble busts,

Let me raise you up.

If your glitter rusts,

Let me raise you up. (and up)

Raise you up

Raise you up

Raise you up

Just be.

Raise you up

Raise you up.

We’re the same, Charlie Boy, you and me

Just be.

Who you wanna be.

Never let ‘em tell you who you ought to be

Just be. With dignity.

Celebrate yourself triumphantly.

You’ll see.

You’ll see.

Just be.

Just be.

Ladies, gentlemen, and those who have yet to make up their minds-

As people all over the world clamor for kinky boots, we have to get back to work.

But before we go, we would like to leave you with the Brice and Simon secret to success:

Alright, now we’ve all heard of the 12 step program, have we not?

Yes, but what you can do in 12, I want you to know that we all can do in 6 now, and it goes like this:

One: Pursue the truth

Two: Learn something new

Three: Accept yourself and you’ll accept others too!

Four: Let love shine

Five: Let pride be your guide

Six: Change the world when you change your mind!

Just be. Who you wanna be.

Never let them tell you who you oughta be.

Just be. With dignity.

Celebrate yourself triumphantly.

You’ll see.

It’s beautiful.

You’ll see

It’s beautiful.

Just be.

It’s beautiful.

Just be.

You’ll see.

It’s beautiful.

You’ll see

It’s beautiful.

Just be.

It’s beautiful.

Just be.

Beautiful.
