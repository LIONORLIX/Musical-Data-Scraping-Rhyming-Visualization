Soul of a Man


I'm bad news, a black and blues-er

Who's a loser, a merry-go-round spiraling down

I'm all used up, chaffed and chewed up

Who's just screwed up, the same old Charlie hitting the ground



Cause I'll never be the soul of a man, noble and wise

Like the soul of a man who lifted me high

Soul of a man, heroic and true

Like the soul of a man I looked up to

What else could I do



Stupid Hubris, no excuses

I blew my fuses, I guess I'm just a ruse in my fathers shoes

Not amusing, no confusing this streak of losing

Totally brutal and useless too



How can I be the soul of a man, noble and wise

Like the soul of a man who lifted me high

Soul of a man, heroic and true

Like the soul of a man that I looked up to

What else could I



Just when I'm reaching for that rung at the top

On that broken heel steady, ready ready to drop



When will I be the soul of a man, noble and wise

Like the soul of a man who lifted me high

Soul of a man, heroic and true

Like the soul of a man I looked up to

What else could I do



I'll never be, no I'll never be

I have gone and let you down

Whoa, soul, soul of a man

Here comes that familiar sound

Same old Charlie hitting the ground
