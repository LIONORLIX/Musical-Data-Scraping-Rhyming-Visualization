Take What You Got


HARRY

Remember the pub where our fathers went

To spend the end of the day?



CHARLIE

Remember the yard behind the pub

Where we would run and play?



HARRY

Yeah, well, now the pub is a laundromat



CHARLIE

Now, the yard is a high-rise flat



HARRY

You can't go back

You can't make it last



HARRY

You've gotta take what you've got

Even when your life is in knots

You take aim, take your shot

Sometimes, you've got to re-write the plot

You've got to take what you've got



CHARLIE

You'd always say that one of these days

You'd get out of Northampton town



HARRY

You'd always that you wouldn't stay

No, you wouldn't stick around



CHARLIE

Never knew what I wanted before

Now I'm even more unsure



HARRY

You can't move on if you're still in the past



You've gotta take what you've got

Even when your life is in knots

You take aim, take your shot

Sometimes, you've got to re-write the plot

You've got to take what you've got



CHARLIE

Everybodys telling me what I need to be

Change with the times, move to London town

Or live out a legacy

Well, maybe this time, Ill take a chance

Leap into the vast expanse

Maybe this time, Ill seize my destiny

My destinyyyyyyyy!

...yyyyyyyyyeh.



HARRY

If youre on the wrong road, turn back



CHARLIE

So, youll help me out?

Thank you, Harry.



Two, three!



HARRY/CHARLIE

You've gotta take what you've got

Even when your life is in knots

You take aim, take your shot

Sometimes, you've got to re-write the plot

You've got to take what you've got
