Price and Son Theme / The Most Beautiful Thing in the World


CHORUS

Wrap your feet in Price and Son

Our work is tried and true

Practical, Pragmatical

Steadfast and Steady Too (Steady Too)

If you stroll or saunter and/or bike, jog, hike or run

The prudent shoe for you to choose is

Price and Son



MR. PRICE

You might think beauty comes in spring and sparrow

When the sun rise, it’s the morning dew

But if you walk the straight and narrow

You’ll find the elegance and comfort is a—

Do you know what the most beautiful thing in the world is Charlie?



YOUNG CHARLIE

YOUNG CHARLIE AND MR. PRICE

The most beautiful thing in the world!

The most beautiful thing in the world!



MR. PRICE

Charlie, it’s beautiful



For generations have paved the way before you

You’ll be next in line when my time is through

And there’s a saying handed down I’ve found of value

That you can tell about the fella from his



YOUNG CHARLIE

YOUNG LOLA

Feels like I’m dancing across the high wire

Or bravely soaring up into the blue

Just like a rocket looks with sparks and fire

Feels like the magic never ends inside these



UNKNOWN

Take those things off your feet and get inside here stupid boy!



NICOLA

Charlie, here are the shoes I told you about! Come have a look-see!

Aren’t they the most necessary things ever?

If you want to slip a ring on my finger, you’ll first slip these shoes on my feet.



CHARLIE

It’s a tad posh for life in North Hampton, wouldn’t you say?



NICOLA

Then good thing we’re moving to London!

And won’t they make a fittin farewell to the stink of cattle farms and tanin leather?

Oh we may have been born in a small factory town,

But we sure as hell don’t have to die there!



CHARLIE

You see the price? There’s three months rent!



NICOLA

Pinch or pay for em, that is up to you, but these shoes are in my future!



To new beginnings

Hello to sunny days

We’re upward mobile now

Goodbye to small town ways

Till it’s impossible to find

a trace of what we left behind

And a defining element is in these

Shoes!



NICOLA AND CHORUS

The most beautiful thing in the world!

The most beautiful thing in the world,



NICOLA

Charlie, that I know!



NICOLA AND CHORUS

I know!



The most beautiful thing in the world!

The most beautiful thing in the world, Charlie

It’s beautiful!

MR. PRICE

Your life, your future, is right here at this factory! You belong here!



CHARLIE

No Dad, I belong with Nicola in London.



MR. PRICE

No, you belong here.



CHARLIE

Will you toast my journey?



MR. PRICE

But to leave your home and family for a job shopping in London!





CHARLIE

Marketing, Dad.

Richard Bailey has offered Nicola and me positions marketing real estate.



MR. PRICE

You’re breaking my heart, Charlie.



CHARLIE

MR. PRICE

Shoes can protect a man’s journey, but only his heart can choose the path.

And so a toast to our own Charlie.

May you never fail to point your shoes back home.
