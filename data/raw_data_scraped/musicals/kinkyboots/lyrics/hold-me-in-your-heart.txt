Hold Me in Your Heart


You don't want to see me anymore.

You can't listen to me laugh out loud.

You don't wanna see me dance.

You can't even take the chance

that it might reflect on you.

You missed out on the best part of me.

The part that made me who I am today.

O, but the best part of me is standing in front of you

and loves you anyway.

Hold me In your heart till you understand.

Hold me In your heart just the way that I am.

With all your faults, I love you.

Don't give up on me.

I wont give up on you.

Well you took my hand, taught me how to be strong

That's where I picked up when we went all wrong.

I know that I hurt you, and you hurt me too,

but you mean more to me, I must mean more to you.

Hold me In your heart till you understand.

Hold me In your heart just the way that I am

With all your faults I love you

I need you to love me that way too.
