What A Woman Wants


Stand back, let me tell you something

What a woman wants to see

Stand back, Mr. I-Know-Everything

But it's what you blindly see



What a woman wants

Masculinity

(What a Man)

Sensitivity

(What a Man)

In a fantasy

(What a Man)

What a woman wants

(What a Man)

A muffin to clutch

(What a Man)



Just a tender touch

You don't get out too much

To know the smoothness of her skin with a gentle caress

Feel the feathery quality of her dress

What separates a man like you from a man like me



I'm a reflection,

Her protection

I'm her curious mystery

(What a Man)

What a woman

(What a Man)

What a woman wants

(What a Man, what a man)

What woman wants

(What a Man, what a man, What a Man, what a man)

What woman

(What a Man)

What a woman

(What a Man, what a man)

What a woman wants

(What a man)



C'mon we all know what a bird really wants is a rock solid

Mmhmm



COMMITMENT

Look at me, devilishly debonair

Look at you divinely dull, drab and dumpy

A woman wants a man to give as much as she can take

Just like me

A libidinous Lothario on the make

Oh piss off



SPOKEN:

Oh I have a challenge for you.

Write down what you think

I need to do to be a real man and

I'll do the same for you.

Whatever you tell me to do

I will have to do.

But you will have to do the same for me.

Deal?



I ain't wearing no poufy dress.

Chickening out already?



REPEATS:

(What a man, what a man, what a man)

What a woman wants

What a woman wants

What a woman wants

What a woman

What a woman

What a woman wants is me

What a woman wants

What a woman wants

(What a man)
