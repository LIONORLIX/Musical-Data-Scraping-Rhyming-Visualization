Charlie's Soliloquy


Charlie:

Do I belong here?

Am I what's wrong here?

Know what I'm doing?

Or am I a fraud?

Do I fit in?

Where do I begin?

Same old Charlie,

Frightened and flawed.

So, I pretend

and keep my head up like I

Know how this will end.



Maybe these pieces

Are falling together.

Making me feel like

I'm not alone.

Punching holes

Into this leather

This kind'a feels like

I'm back home.



I'm watching myself

And I know what to do.

Hey look at me now

It's a shoe.
