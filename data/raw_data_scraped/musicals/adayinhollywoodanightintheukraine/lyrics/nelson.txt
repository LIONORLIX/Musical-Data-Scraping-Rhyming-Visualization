Nelson


My heart, my love, my life is his alone

But if, but if, but if the truth be known

My hero must stand on a box in our love scenes

God, does he act like a lox in our love scenes

Nelson, what your putting me through



And all of his notes above B flat verbotten

And all of his notes below B flat are rotten

Oh, Nelson, Don't call me, I'll call you



His love making casts such a pall

It's not hard to sleep through at all

His vocal chords carry insurance by Lloyd's and so I might add, should his adenoids

The lights wilt his hairdo on camera he'll primp and quite frankly, his hair isn't all that goes

limp.



Darling Nelson

How incredibly boring, that's not singing it's snoring!

What your putting me through!



A picture of strength, and good breeding.

of course and of passion and warmth, (I'm discussing his horse)

Darling Nelson, don't call me, I'll call you



A symbol of virtue and class

America's sweethearts my ass "A pair made in heaven," the fans love to say

but each time we kiss I swear that he's gay.

In film after film after film I betrothed him, we snuggled and smooched,

and oh God, how I loathed him.



My Nelson,

oh so calming you'll never need embalming

Oh Nelson, what you're putting me through!
