Once Upon A Time


JASON

Once upon a time

I first held your hand

And love was not a crime

In a private world where

You said don't look down?

But then I did and now you?re lost above me



So much left to say

Trapped alone here

With my best laid plans astray

Standing scared outside a cold church

Soul search, seeking some lost answer

From a God who loves me



Can I turn to You in my need?

Would You take me back or watch me bleed?

Are You there? There at all?

And as I fall from the person that I tried to be

Could You really love someone like me?



Once upon a time

All I needed was his hand in mine

Then I lost my way and

Now I know not what I do

I bow my head and turn to You
