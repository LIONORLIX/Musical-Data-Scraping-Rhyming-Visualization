A Glooming Peace


CHORUS

A glooming peace this morning with it brings

The sun for sorrow will not show its head

Go hence to talk no more of these sad things

Some shall be pardoned and some punished



PRIEST

I'm sorry



PETER

I know



PRIEST

People come to the church in times like these for answers

But I have none...most words fall empty, but I'll try...

It is a horrible thing that no one should have to go through

Losing a friend at such a young age

You know, but you should know, that he is in a much better place

We'll always ask ourselves if there was something more

That could have been done...and that's natural



PETER

Do you ask yourself that, Father?



PRIEST

Me?
