A Quiet Night at Home


(NADIA)

A quiet night at home

Silent night

A joy to pass a quiet night at home

A quiet night at home

All my friends are gone

And once again I find myself alone



A quiet night at home

Just me and my good shepherd

He and I can count a million sheep

A quiet night at home

Filling up that time

Till finally I get to sleep



A quiet night at home

Mother's worried glances

Take my hand, smile, sadly sigh

Words of wisdom

Talks of ships and princes

Soothing sagas laced with loving lies



Sadness

Who me sad?

A quiet night at home

My favorite place

'Honey, it?ll be ok

Slim down dear, things will change

For after all you?ve such a pretty face'



A quiet night at home

Play my siren song

Attracting none, my ship just wont come in

Clinging to the rigid rock of ages

Never ever even get the chance to sin

Passing two productive hours

Tearing through a hundred pages

What a tale of star crossed lovers

Life is lived on other stages



Pain adores me

God ignores me

Always thinking, thinking

Sinking, never dancing

Never asked and asking why?

Why? then never, never cry

Far too clever

Big girl

Big girl



Ships and princes

All gone home

Alone again

Again, alone



A quiet night at home

With thoughts of why

A quiet night at home

Spent getting by
