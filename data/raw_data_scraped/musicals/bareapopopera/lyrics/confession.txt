Confession


STUDENTS

We're doing time in confession

It's a sacrament of oppression

We have no need for forgiveness

Because our shit's none of his business



KYRA

I got so high I fainted



ALAN

Sometimes I don't recycle



ZACH

I finally nailed my girlfriend



LUCAS

I took some extra Nyquil



TANYA

I blinked and it was over



DIANE

I swear with all my life I'll...



STUDENTS

...sin no more, I'm sorry Lord



We're doing time in confession

It's a poor man's therapy session

We have no need for forgiveness

Because our shit's none of his business



KYRA & TANYA

He best mind his own business!



ALAN

What does glory begot?



DIANE

He gave me nine Hail Mary's



TANYA

Twenty-five All Fathers



LUCAS

This is so arbitrary



DIANE

I don't think God intended

Confession to be scary



STUDENTS

Say that you'll forgive me Lord

We're doing time in confession

We're working out some oppression

We have no need for forgiveness

Because our shit's none of his business

Hell no, our shit's none of his business



PETER & MATT

Father...



PETER

Can the church be wrong?



MATT

Can a sin be right?



PETER

If it's something that you feel



MATT

Something that you saw?



BOTH

Goes against the law, what do you do?



MATT

Do you tell?



BOTH

What do I follow?



PRIEST

The church's teachings come from centuries of study

Questions of doctrine are best left to greater minds than yours

This is not to say the church is never wrong

But if you hold to her creed you'll never find yourself let down

Is there anything else, son?



PETER & MATT

No, Father



PETER

Hear my voice



MATT

Did you really hear me?



IVY

Hear my voice



KYRA

I don't think you see me



MATT & NADIA

Do you think you know me?



ZACH

Did you really hear me?



DIANE & RORY

Would you really know me?



MATT

Do you think you see me?



ALAN, RORY, ZACH & DIANE

Hear my voice



PETER

If I ever told you...

If I ever told you...

If I ever told you...



SISTER CHANTELLE

Ok, let's just try to put yesterday's rehearsal behind us. New day, new attitude...3...4.



CHOIR

Two households, both alike in dignity

In fair Verona where we lay our scene



SISTER CHANTELLE

People, your first note is a C natural.

Ain't nothing natural about what you're singing.



CHOIR

From ancient grudge break to new mutiny

Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean



SISTER CHANTELLE

That's it!

There's bad, and then there's whatever y'all are doing.

Have mercy! Go practice somewhere I can't hear you



IVY

Sister Chantelle? I did some sketches. You know, like for the poster or the program?



SISTER CHANTELLE

uh huh



JASON

Hey, that looks great



IVY

Oh, thanks



NADIA

Bathroom stalls don't lie! She's good with her hands!
