God Don't Make No Trash


SISTER CHANTELLE

Peter...

When the Lord sits on his mighty throne

And says 'what shall I make today?'

He don't grab a drawing board

There's no mistakes, the man don't play

He simply opens up his heart

Out come tumbling works of art

God don't make no trash



PETER

Sister Chantelle?

I would be more than glad to discuss this with you...

[he looks at her face]

...now



SISTER CHANTELLE

God don't make mistakes, y'see

Or everyone would look like me

People need to start to think

It ain't a rainbow without the pink

Shoot the foul play and tell the jury

Dance ahead make no body (?) fury

God don't make no trash



PETER

That's nice of you to say...



SISTER CHANTELLE

Shut up!



God don't have a guestlist

We're all invited to his feast

And if the church's against that well

It ain't the nuns, boy, it ain't the priests (?)

Stand up proud, straight and tall

If you don't be straight, no problem at all

God don't make no trash



PETER

I'm gonna be later for...



SISTER CHANTELLE

Heaven knows, nothing works

They're known to misquote their verse

Preaching hate, but I'm saying 'wait!'

Where did Jesus mention that?

Some are small, some are dumb

Keep on pushing, change will come

Till then just keep in sight

God is on your side

Oh!



People pointing fingers

You feel free to point it back

Two folks want to fall in love

If no one's hurt, what's wrong with that?

God is love all the time

Search your soul and I think you'll find

God don't make no trash

And if you're wondering why I'm a fan

It's because there's a black woman inside the soul of every gay man

God don't make no,

God don't make no,

God don't make no trash!





(Nadia and Ivy's dialogue is on the "All Grown Up" page...)
