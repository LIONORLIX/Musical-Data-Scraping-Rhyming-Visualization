Are You There


MATT

Do you know-well, of course you do-

What it’s like to stand outside?

To watch the world and wish

You didn’t hurt so much, you cried

I know I’m not the only one

And I know I shouldn’t care

But when I feel these things are real

I wish I felt you there

And if I did, I’d ask you

How come life is so unfair?



PETER

Do you know-well, of course you do-

What it’s like to be afraid?

That nothing will become

Of all the plans that you have made?

So I watch the girls surround him

And he says it’s just a game

I guess that I believe him

But it hurts me just the same

And I’m all about this stupid act

So who am I to blame?



BOTH

Are you there? Are you there?

Do you watch me when I cry?

And if it’s in your power,

How can you sit idly by?

I try so hard to please you

But you never seem to see



MATT

Is it my fate to sit and wait?



PETER

Wonder what my struggle means



MATT

I wish I knew that someone out there cared



PETER

Are you there?



BOTH

Cared for me



MATT

Who’s out there?



PETER

Matt?



MATT

Yeah!

Are you alright?



PETER

I’m fine



MATT

Here, have some wine



PETER

This is holy wine!



MATT

The Father hasn’t blessed it yet



PETER

In that case…



MATT

Grab a chalice



PETER

Thanks.

Life sucks…



MATT

Here, have the rest

So why’d you leave?



PETER

The party?



MATT

Yeah



PETER

I was getting kind of bored



MATT

[Laugh] Oh, me too!



PETER

There’s another reason…



MATT

Yeah?



PETER

It sucks to be ignored



MATT

I know!

I always fight to do what’s right, and this is my reward



PETER

This is my reward



BOTH

Are you there? Are you there?

Can you make some time for me?

They tell me that you’re out there

And they tell me that you see

I try to find the meaning

God, you know how hard I’ve tried

But I don’t know where I’m going

And I don’t have any guide



MATT

They said things would get better

But I guess…they lied



PETER

Are you there?

He needs to give me more!



MATT

I’ll drink to that!



PETER

Who cares if people think we’re fine?

We’ve been through this before!

One day he’ll wake up

And realize all he needs is me

Until then, God, I wish I knew

I need a guarantee



MATT

I need to know for sure that you’ll be there



PETER

Send a sign so that I know you’re there



BOTH

There for me



PETER

Send a sign so that I know you’re there



MATT

Send a sign so that I know you’re there



BOTH

There for me





PETER

Who’s leading?



MATT

Well, who usually leads?



[Peter whispers in Matt’s ear that he and Jason are boyfriends]



MATT

I’m going to bed

Catch you later, ok?
