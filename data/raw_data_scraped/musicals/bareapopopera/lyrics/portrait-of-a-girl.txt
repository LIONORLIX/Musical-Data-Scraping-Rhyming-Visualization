Portrait of a Girl


IVY

Portrait of a girl

Canvas of ages

The stage is hers

Demure and practiced beauty

Hold them all enthralled



Portrait of a girl

Object of rumour

A pose at play

They say she's fairest of them all



Paint her in

Watching one color end and one begin

Brush away what's stray

Add a finishing touch

The rapture cold as a pearl

Now the portrait has captured the girl

Now the portrait has captured the girl



Portrait of a girl



MATT

Don't mind me

I'm just watching



IVY

Painted illusion



MATT

It looks just just like you



IVY

She'll play her part

She sees that she's a work of art



MATT

Just understand I'm taken in



IVY

Watching one color end and one begin

Brush away what's stray

There's disguise in her eyes

Add shadows that dance across her skin

Hide the doubt that cries out within her



MATT

Don't know what to say

Scared to say too much



BOTH

Stripped bare beneath all the layers



IVY

Would you recognize the girl lying there?



MATT

I know there's love lying there



IVY

Sought after, trapped like a pearl

Now the portrait has captured the girl.

Now the portrait has captured the girl.



BOTH

Daring you to fall

Fairest of them all
