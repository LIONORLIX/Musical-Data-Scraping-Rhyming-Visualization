Plain Jane Fat Ass


NADIA

Oh I know a girl full of confidence.

Yes, whenever she's full, she's a confident girl.

She'll have your piece of pie-

Then inhale another ten

There's a thin girl inside her with twelve of her friends.



Hips that could bear you a buffalo



JASON

Longhorn?



NADIA

Ass thats so vast I could block out the sun



JASON

You know that you're insane



NADIA

I'm a caution for the vain.

Mothers say 'Well, dear there's fat, then there's Jane.'



Plain Jane fat ass

Guilty of swallowing Jenny Craig whole

Plane Jane fat ass

Keeping society so ill at ease and loving her role.



JASON

Why are you so hard on yourself?



NADIA

Why are you such an over achiever?



(Simultaneously)

NADIA: Mom...

JASON: Dad...



JASON

Nadia, it's just that I know you'd be happier-



NADIA

Okay, kiddo- I didn't spend thousand of dollars on private golf lessons

so you could quit the team sophomore year.



JASON

It's mind over matter-



NADIA

If you keep your mind focused-



JASON

We just want you to be happy...



NADIA

To make us happy...



But why can't the fat girl play Juliet?

It's the plumpest of roles, so then why not pick me?



JASON

It's just a stupid show



NADIA

Says the dahsing Romeo

Well, I've played a servant for years in a row.



But I'll have the last laugh- you bet your ass.

Hurt me? You can't- I have mounds of thick skin.

Beating high school doesn't last, and someday, I have a hunch

That I'll eat them for breakfast and shit them for lunch.



Plain Jane fat ass

Hungry for love, she's a sesitive soul

Plain Jane fat ass

Keeping society so ill at ease and loving her role.



NADIA (spoken):

Dad's birthday package arrived...

Two weeks late as usual.

Here's your birthday cheque - financial proof that dad loves ya

And oh, surprise! A note!



(Sung) 'Dear Jason,

Please find enclosed: this very thick package that came for you yesterday

I talked to Father Flynn and he told me you were in,

But call anyway when you open it.'

Notre Dame!

'We always knew that you'd keep the McConnell flame burning

Love Dad'



(Spoken)

JASON: Hey, what did Dad get you?



NADIA: You mean what did dad's secretary get me?



JASON: Huh..



NADIA: These earrings - I think they're slimming. What do you think?



JASON: Come here.
