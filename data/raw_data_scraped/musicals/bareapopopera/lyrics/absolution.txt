Absolution


FATHER [spoken]

People come to the church at times like these for answers but... I have none. Most words seem to fall empty... but I'll try. It's a horrible thing no one should have to go through, losing... a friend... at such a young age. You know, or you should know, that he's in a better place. We'll always ask ourselves if there was something more that could have been done. That's natural.



PETER [spoken]

Do you ask yourself that Father?



FATHER [spoken]

Me?



PETER

He went to you for guidance

You hid behind a screen

Knowing how much empathy might mean

Do you know how much he loved?

Did you know how much he cared?

Lost in the teaching was a boy

So all alone and scared

Father, we were so in love!

And that's what I find so odd

Our love was pure and nothing else

Brought me closer to God



PRIEST

I'm sorry, Peter



PETER

And I forgive you Father.
