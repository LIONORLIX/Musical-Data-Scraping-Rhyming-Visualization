In the Hallway


PETER (Praying rapidly)

Our father, who art in heaven

Hallowed be thy name

Thy kingdom come, thy will be done

On earth as it is in Heaven

Give us this day our daily bread

And forgive us our trespasses

As we forgive those who trespass against us

Lead us not into temptation

And deliver us from evil

Amen



JASON

How was break?



PETER

I didn't tell anyone, so don't worry about it



JASON

I don't want it to be like this...



[a bell rings]



LUCAS

Hey boys, they posted class ranks!

Little bitch, you're valedictorian

But I'd like to say Mr. Man [points to himself]

Did NOT finish last

Thank you foreign exchange student!



PRIEST

Congratulations Jason and Matt

It's down to the wire...speeches

Keep them real, more importantly, keep them short

I don't know about the rest of you, but I heard a bell



IVY

Hey, you got a second?



JASON

Yeah, what's up?



IVY

It's just that I haven't seen you since...

I just thought that you would call me over the break

I mean...it's fine that you didn't, but...



JASON

No, you're right, I should have called...
