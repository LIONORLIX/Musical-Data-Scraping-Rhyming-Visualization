Warning


So there it is

Clare it is

As you feared



All these years of wonder

Their closure draws near



A quiet kind of distance

A word I would not touch



Did I ever know my son at all?

Well now I know too much



But where was the warning?

How can this be?



I guess there are somethings

We don't want to see.



Where was the warning

To know this was coming?



Now what do I do with

This news find numbing



Where was the warning,

Where was the warning?



And what if I liked the song I heard before,

The one I sang when my boy was born

All the dreams I had for him

They fade away, lost in words I cannot say.



I wish that I could hold him, God,

He's all alaone and scared.

I should be there for him, I love him so

But I am not repaid,



And where was the warning?

His father will die

How do I tell him? He can't see me cry



Where was the warning?

Don't tell anyone.

I don't want their pity.



I just want ,,, my son.



It's happened, it's happened,

And life is so strange

One simple word

And the whole world has changed

Could this really be my child?

My firstborne, my child.

Playing in his cradle, so tender and mild...
