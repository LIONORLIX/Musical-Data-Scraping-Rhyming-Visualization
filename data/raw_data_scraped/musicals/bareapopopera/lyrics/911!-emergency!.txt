911! Emergency!


SISTER CHANTELLE

Peter! Peter!



PETER

Fuck me!



SISTER CHANTELLE

Lovely intro



KYRA & TANYA

Watch your mouth, boy!



SISTER CHANTELLE

You need more help than I thought



PETER

What’s that supposed to mean?



SISTER CHANTELLE

Listen up, Peter

I may be a virgin but I ain’t new to the game

Don’t be frontin’ with Mary



PETER

Holy shit!



SISTER CHANTELLE

I’ll pretend I didn’t hear that.



KYRA & TANYA

Think it over.



PETER

Hail Mary full of grace



SISTER CHANTELLE

Stop, stop, stop!

Do you know how tired I am of that prayer?

What do you know about 2,000 years

And they still be saying the same prayer



KYRA & TANYA

Change is comin’ – it’s comin’!



SISTER CHANTELLE

I have a message for you, Peter



KYRA & TANYA

Listen closely



SISTER CHANTELLE

Now where’d I put it? All these pockets...

Oh yeah, here it is!



KYRA & TANYA

Seek and ye shall find



SISTER CHANTELLE

“You shall know the truth and it shall…”

Who writes this stuff?



KYRA & TANYA

Too generic



SISTER CHANTELLE

Never mind, I’m just gonna wing it



TANYA

Mary loves her puns



SISTER CHANTELLE

Now, I saw what you just did



KYRA & TANYA

Mary saw you



SISTER CHANTELLE

Seems the love that dare not speak its name done gone ahead and spoke



KYRA & TANYA

Now the secret’s out



SISTER CHANTELLE

You tell one person – that’s it – cat’s out of the bag



KYRA & TANYA

Will he keep it?



SISTER CHANTELLE

There’s a phone call that’s now overdue to your mother, baby



KYRA & TANYA

Time to call her up

Operator!



SISTER CHANTELLE

Get on mama’s line



KYRA & TANYA

Operator!



SISTER CHANTELLE

Heaven knows it’s time.



KYRA & TANYA

Operator!



SISTER CHANTELLE

Can you put him through?



ALL THREE

Someone’s got a job to do



KYRA & TANYA

Operator!



SISTER CHANTELLE

Mama loves you, boy



KYRA & TANYA

Operator!



SISTER CHANTELLE

You’re her pride and joy



KYRA & TANYA

Operator!



SISTER CHANTELLE

Get the doing done



ALL THREE

Reach out, baby – touch someone

911! Emergency! Time to be a grown up

We done gone and made the call – you need to pick the phone up

Ring your mother, tell it all, go ahead and own up

Stop your lying, drop the drama

Tell the world but first tell mama

Let her know!



SISTER CHANTELLE

I’ve read the books, Peter



KYRA & TANYA

Oprah picked ‘em



SISTER CHANTELLE

Sayin’ “Come out when you’re ready”

But don’t talk about it - be about it!



KYRA & TANYA

Come on, come on out, boy



SISTER CHANTELLE

Cause life is now, sugar



KYRA & TANYA

Gotta live your life



SISTER CHANTELLE

Don’t hide there under a bushel...

Or whatever my baby used to say



KYRA & TANYA

Jesus knows what’s up

Operator!



SISTER CHANTELLE

Help the boy connect



KYRA & TANYA

Operator!



SISTER CHANTELLE

Let him call collect



KYRA & TANYA

Operator!



SISTER CHANTELLE

Can you put him through?



ALL THREE

Someone’s got a job to do



KYRA & TANYA

Operator!



SISTER CHANTELLE

Got to change the plan



KYRA & TANYA

Operator!



SISTER CHANTELLE

Time to take a stand



KYRA & TANYA

Operator!



SISTER CHANTELLE

Get the doing done



ALL THREE

Reach out, baby, touch someone



911! Emergency! Time to be a grown up

We done gone and made the call – you need to pick the phone up

Ring your mother, tell it all, go ahead and own up

Mop your mess up, drop the drama.

Tell the world but first tell mama.



911! Emergency! Life is full of choices

Baby, here’s a 411: with truth the world rejoices

Let it out, let mama in, boy, you need to hear the voices

Stop the secrets, drop the drama

Roll it out but first tell mama

Let her know!



SISTER CHANTELLE

That’s it. God bless.



PETER

But is it okay if I’m not sure… (?)



SISTER CHANTELLE

Uh-uh! No questions

This isn’t “Conversations with Mary”



KYRA & TANYA

It ain’t that book, baby



SISTER CHANTELLE

You’ll figure it out

And I’m on the tightest of schedules

Work, work, work, save, save, save

So many in need

But does the head of the first family lift a wing to help?

NO! Joseph be telling me

“I let you ride the donkey all the way to Bethlehem”

Now that was 2,000 years ago, ok?

I’m talkin’ about what has he done for me lately?



KYRA & TANYA

Of course there’s no room at the inn if you just try to roll up! I swear, the force (?) comin’ into the apartment is gonna come

thundering down. There didn’t have to be no manger! (?) I swear, it ain’t the greatest story ever told if you gonna tell it every

find minutes! And she still be talkin’ about ‘Why the Wise Men didn’t bring me nothin?’ Oh…Hey. Hello.”

Keep it up. Just keep it up, and I know two ladies about to be touched by an angel. You got that? We out!



[Kyra gives Peter a cell phone on their way out]
