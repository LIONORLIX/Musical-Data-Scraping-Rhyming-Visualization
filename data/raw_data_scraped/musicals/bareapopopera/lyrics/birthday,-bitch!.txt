Happy birthday Ivy, you’re the ugliest of all

You are the worst and most perverse to roam Cecilia’s hallowed halls

Your mother was a hooker and your father was a dick

He poked her in the toaster

And the pair produced a pig

Whose brain is awfully tiny

And whose ass is awfully big

Happy birthday, bitch!

(Ivy barks)

Happy birthday, bitch

Happy birthday, Ivy!

Bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch!



NADIA

Stupid fucking bitch!
