One


IVY:

But I meant all those things I told you

My feelings for you are real and I...

Just know I wouldn't lie



JASON:

But why?



IVY:

There's something about you, Jason

I can't put my finger on the why...

But I'd like to try

I don't know just what it is i'm doing here

When nothing's clear



JASON:

You want me to kiss you, don't you?

Kiss you is what I'm supposed to do...



IVY:

So, are you going to?



JASON:

Am I...?



IVY:

If you like me, kiss me, don't stop

I want you, you see it in my eyes

I've tried, but it's hard to hide



JASON:

Hide with me



IVY:

Chasing you is such a game of hide and seek



JASON:

Lie with me

Lie with me



{INSTRUMENTAL BREAK}



NADIA: And I keep on waiting...

MATT: Waiting

NADIA: And I keep on hating all...

MATT: Hating all the pain

MATT: Trying to begin

NADIA: And I keep on dying...

BOTH: dying to fit in



IVY:

One forever; can you feel it?

I'm so happy. Does it show?

Baby, you are all I need

Hold me; don't let go



JASON:

One tomorrow; make me promise

God you have such pretty eyes

Baby, you are all I need

I have butterflies



BOTH:

One connection; One you promised,

One religion; One today

Here inside you I am certain:

You can help me find my way



PETER:

Are you there? Please pick up the phone

I've never felt so all alone

Left with paper, courage... alone

Crawl inside and want to die... alone



JASON:

One again, I'm getting closer

No regrets, I see the light

This is now, and this is perfect

God, I know that this is right



IVY:

One confession: God, I love you

Jason, take me all the way

Screw today, and screw tomorrow

Don't go, won't you stay

(Don't go.... Won't you stay....)



MATT:

And I'm not letting go

Of what we had so you should know

That I will find you, I will mind you

You were once my one



IVY:

One moment, one chance connection

One vision, one stolen stare

One cover, one dance, one lover

One vision, one answered prayer

(Don't go.... Won't you stay....)



PETER:

At first I had a hero...

I guess he couldn't stay

Fear took up his trembling hand

And led him far way



IVY & JASON:

One I love you; One forever

One tomorrow, One today

Deep inside you I am certain:

You can help me find my way
