Two Households


LUCAS [spoken]

Apothecary's open, come get your shit



SISTER CHANTELLE [spoken]

Alright everyone, this is it. Let's really try to focus on the opening... of the song, not Kyra's blouse, close it up! The buttons aren't for show Lady Marmalade. And...



CHORUS

Two households, both alike in dignity



SISTER CHANTELLE [spoken]

Dignity? How 'bout some harmony? Dianne, that's it. Lip Sync.



CHORUS

Two households, both alike in dignity



SISTER CHANTELLE [spoken]

Tanya get your hands right outta that boy's costume and simmer down! It's not that kind of party.



CHORUS

Two households, both alike in dignity



SISTER CHANTELLE [spoken]

Jason, Ivy, you're not dead till the end, you're in love! Whatever, pretend!

I don't care how you do it, that best be one hell of a kiss.

Sister Chantelle's raise is riding on this! People, pull it together!

Ready? ...Three, four.



CHORUS

Two households both alike in dignity

In fair Verona where we lay our scene

From ancient grudge break to new mutiny

Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean



SISTER CHANTELLE [spoken]

Thank you, Jesus!



LUCAS [spoken]

Never let it be said I don't deliver.



JASON [spoken]

Thanks...



LUCAS [spoken]

You know we're still cool, right?



JASON [spoken] [to Peter]

Hey. I talked to Father... about us.



PETER [spoken]

Really? And?

Oh.



JASON

What if we escape this?

Peter you and I?

Ran away just never looking back?



PETER

Jason...

You can't hide any more

I can't hide any more

I don't want to



JASON

But what if we--



PETER [spoken]

Jason, stop...



JASON

Just think about it please

We could leave right now



PETER [spoken]

Jason... it's over.



JASON [spoken]

Okay...



SISTER CHANTELLE [spoken]

Two minutes everyone!



NADIA

You look great



IVY

Don't feel great



NADIA

I know...



MATT [spoken]

Peter... what I did... that was messed up. I didn't mean to... I'm sorry.



PETER [spoken]

It's done



KYRA [spoken]

Actors ready!



JASON [spoken]

Wait--
