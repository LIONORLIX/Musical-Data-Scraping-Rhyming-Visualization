NADIA

Dear Jason, there will be tears today

But we'll get through and you'll be there

I'll leave a chair for you, you made it too

You held your mystery so close

But I knew, I knew your way

Never found the words to say

Always thought we'd talk one day



IVY

Dear Jason, you can't begin to know

The pain you've caused

How do I make sense of what I've gained

And what I lost?

What a mess, a perfect mess

Left alone to sort it out

In the sorrow, guilt, and rage

I keep coming back to doubt



MATT

I'd like to start with just a...

If we could take a moment...

If maybe we were silent...

Or we had spoken...

[Chorus joins in with Ahh's]

I tried to find the words to...

Just the right quotation...

But I must confess I came up empty



CHORUS

You alone the Lord most holy

You alone the Lord most high

Hear us now, steer our hearts

And grant our prayers

We bare them in Your name

Make us one with all, God, in Your name



PETER

Dear Jason, how did a simple love get complicated?

Days crawl by, I ask myself again

Should I have waited?

In a world that's quick to judge

I will try to understand

It's so hard to find your way

When you have no voice to guide you



CHORUS

No voice, no sound

No sound, no words

No words, no songs

No songs, no heart

One heart, one love

One love, one life

One life, one truth

One truth, one life

One voice!
