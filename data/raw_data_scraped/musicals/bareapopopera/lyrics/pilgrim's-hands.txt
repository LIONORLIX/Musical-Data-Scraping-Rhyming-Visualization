Pilgrim's Hands


SISTER CHANTELLE

Ladies and gentlemen, we open tomorrow night

And this dance is a mess!

Lucas, those steps are all wrong!

What's wrong with you?



LUCAS

Sister, you're ruining my life!



RORY

Dance, take two!



JASON

Hey, nervous about opening night?



PETER

Not really



JASON

Hey, how's living with Lucas?



PETER

It's...it's fine



JASON

Peter, we graduate on Sunday

Are you really never going to speak to me again?

I miss you...



SISTER CHANTELLE

Ok, let's run Pilgrims' Hands



KYRA or TANYA?

Ivy's not here, Sister Chantelle



SISTER CHANTELLE

What?! Wonderful...

Who's Juliet's understudy?



DIANE

I am!



SISTER CHANTELLE

Alright Diane...

Jason...



JASON

If I profane with my unworthiest hand

This holy shrine, the gentle sin is this

My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand

To soothe that rough touch with a tender kiss



DIANE

Good pilgrim...

Good pilgrim...

Wait! I know it, I swear!



PETER (taking over from DIANE)

Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much

Which mannerly devotion shows in this

For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch

And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss



SISTER CHANTELLE

Zach, in Shakespeare's time boys played all the parts

So I'll thank you to keep your ignorance as hidden as possible

Jason...



JASON

Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?



PETER

Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer



JASON

O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do

They pray, grant thou...lest...lest...



PETER

...lest faith turn to despair



SISTER CHANTELLE

Well done, Peter. Ivy, nice of you to join us, but we're finished

This room will be left open if you want to get together one more time

As for me, I'm off the clock



RORY

Hey guys, let's meet here tonight at seven



TANYA

All of us...and don't be late



LUCAS

Yeah, if you're late, no door prizes for tomorrow



ALAN

Door prizes?



NADIA

Drugs, honey...drugs



IVY (to Jason)

I really need to talk to you...do you not get messages?



JASON

Do you not get messages?

Ok...what is it?



IVY

Not here, just come back to my room



JASON

I can't, I have to finish my speech

You're coming to rehearsal tonight, right?

I can't do this scene without you



IVY

Well, it looks like you can



JASON

I'll meet you before practice



IVY

I'll come by your room



JASON

Ok



SISTER CHANTELLE

Impressive performance



PETER

I help him run his lines



SISTER CHANTELLE

I wasn't talking about the scene



PETER

I should go...
