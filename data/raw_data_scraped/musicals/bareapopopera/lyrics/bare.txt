Bare


JASON

Have we come to the ending?

Or am I just dreaming?

The music is gone now, the silence is strange

Can you call back that moment

On that day in September

When we first shared that secret

And everything changed?

Can you know what you meant

To a soul that was searching?

Can you know that I'm sorry

For all I've undone?

And know that in my heart

You were the only one



PETER

On that day in September it was so unexpected

The moment you kissed me, time seemed to freeze

Now I stand at a crossroad and stare at the question

If prayer were the answer I'd fall on my knees

But forward is calling and I cannot stay here

Nothing can change what you will always be

An angel sent to hold my heart and set me free



JASON / PETER

I've never been this bare / I've never been so scared

I've never felt such honesty / Don't stop we'll never leave

A moment of such peace / Each of us standing bare

Still you are here with me / Knowing who we have to be

Know as you hold my hand / I hoped and prayed

We're forever you and I / That you'd understand



BOTH



I know you're here in my heart



JASON

Please understand that I tried



PETER

Try to see it's not good bye

The act is beginning, the audience awaits



JASON

Let's stay in this moment, where secrets reveal

Here in a world where there's safety in falsehood

I have discovered the one thing that's real

That I love you and I've loved you from the start

And if you hold that close to you, we'll never be apart

Peter, please know I loved you...



PETER

God, I love you



BOTH

From the start



[Jason coughs, they kiss, Peter sobs]
