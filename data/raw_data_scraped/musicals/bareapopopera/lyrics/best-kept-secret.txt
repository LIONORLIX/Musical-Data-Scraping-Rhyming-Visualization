Best Kept Secret


JASON

I know this world can have a place for us

If we just try to find a way to trust that time will be kind

In a fantasy I dream, awake, but reality is give and take

You take what you can, you give time a chance

We have to wait until the world is fast asleep

I'll wipe away your doubt

Show you why we keep

The best kept secret

The best kept secret...of all



PETER

All I ever want is there in your eyes

They tell me I'm alright and I realize I always knew

We whisper words when we're alone at night

I want to hear them in the morning light

And with love on our side maybe we'd be alright

Beneath a million stars there's no need to pretend

I look around tonight, and wonder why we can't end

The best kept secret...



JASON

It's best kept secret...



PETER

Didn't you see how no one in there cared?

A thousand people saw us dancing there

You have to give the world a chance--



JASON

A chance to what?

To see how deep the world can cut?

This is all a fantasy

Then we go back to school...

Just think it through



PETER

I think it through and then you shut me out

You're such a coward!



JASON

And you're a fool!



PETER

You know we can't go on forever this way



JASON

All this 'forever'

Can't you live for today?



PETER

We have to grow up

There's so much more to love



JASON

It's best kept secret



PETER

Best kept secret



JASON / PETER

Best kept secret



PETER

I love you, Jason
