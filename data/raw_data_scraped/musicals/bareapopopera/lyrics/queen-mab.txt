Queen Mab


PETER [spoken]

Tut! Dun's the mouse, the constable's own word, if thou art dun, we'll draw thee from the mire of this sir-reverence love, where in thou stick'st up to the ears. Come, we burn daylight, ho!



JASON [spoken] (weakly)

Tis no wit to go



PETER [spoken]

Um... Why? may one ask.



JASON

I dreamt a dream tonight



PETER

And so did I



JASON

Well, what was yours?



PETER

That dreamers often lie



JASON

In bed asleep, while they do dream things true



PETER

O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you

She is the fairies' midwife

Her traces of the smallest spider web

Pricked from the lazy finger of a maid

In this state she gallops night by night

Ladies' lips, who straight on kisses dream

Then he dreams of another benefice

Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck

And then he dreams of cutting foreign throats

Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes

And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two

And sleeps again

This is she, this is she



JASON [spoken] (weakly)

Peace, Mercutio, peace... thou talk'st of nothing



PETER [spoken]

Are you okay?



JASON [spoken]

I'll be fine.



PETER [spoken]

God, Jason, you're flying.



KYRA [whispered]

Guys come on!
