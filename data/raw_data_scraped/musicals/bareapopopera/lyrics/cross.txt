JASON

I know it's late, but I didn't know where else to go



PRIEST

You know you can always come here - begin



JASON

These are my sins, but where to begin?

I don't know if I have it in me, in me



PRIEST

Go on



JASON

Still I recall the peace that would fall

When I believed you could forgive me

Father, I've messed everything up

I don't know where to start

Yes, I do - God is the root of everything



PRIEST

I'm here to listen, here to understand you

Tell me what lies in your heart

And in the telling you'll find the peace you're seeking

You'll know the way once you start



JASON

Well I've tried to be strong, I've tried to belong

But I don't, or I won't, I can't, I can't

Such a simple, little word - never spoken, always heard

It's not something I can be, it's not ok, not for me

Do you know what I'm trying?



PRIEST

Yes



JASON

What do I do?



PRIEST

I know you're frightened, know I understand that

But there's only so much I would say

I can't live for you, but know that God is with you

Through Him you will find a way



JASON

But I can't see your face

I'm in such a desperate place

What do I do now?

Tell me, tell me



PRIEST

Child, confide in me



JASON

I've known long, I always thought this was wrong

If they knew my family would die, they would die



PRIEST

Then keep it quiet

I will hold your secret

You know that it's safe to confide

You're just a child, and things may change, I promise

You're young with time on your side

Focus on your graduation



JASON

It's not ok



PRIEST

Keep your mind on other matters



JASON

Am I ok?



PRIEST

Pray for courage, pray for...



JASON

Why are you distant?

Why won't you answer?

Why won't you tell me?



PRIEST

[Shouts]

You know in your heart that the teaching is clear

Faith in the Father has led your soul here

Harrow the cross, let the church be your spine

Don't question too much and you'll get along fine

Whatever you have done, I know God will forgive

Live in His word, He will always forgive

Go now in the Spirit and live
