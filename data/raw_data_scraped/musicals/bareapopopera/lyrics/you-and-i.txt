You And I


JASON

Hey little boy would you like a ride, a lollipop, a puppy?

How about a baseball bat?  there's one in my pants



PETER

No thank you. My mom, she said to never talk to strangers



JASON

So a kiss is out of the question then?



PETER

I'll take a chance

So where were you? Online?



Jason

Asleep?



Peter

Like half the congregation



JASON

So are we damned?



PETER

I stayed awake as long as I could



JASON

Good Catholic

I say we go fall asleep together



PETER

Do you?



JASON

Should I bring my baseball bat?



PETER

I think you should

Girls

Jason



Girl 2

did you lose my number?



Girls

Jason



JASON

This is all just a game



You and I

You take my hand leaving me breathless

take a look in these big blue eyes so you'll understand

And know why we whisper in hallways

I'll be with you always

Running together, forever you and I



PETER

Tell me why I should trust you when the girls all lust to touch you



JASON

Cause when I have you near me I go out of my mind

Need help there?



PETER

You're cute, and it's tough to argue with a hard-on

Think that you could lend a hand here?



JASON

If I had the time



STUDENTS

Jason



JASON

Peter, don't you worry



STUDENTS

STUDENTS

Jason



JASON

Let's lay off the crack!



You and I

You and I

You take my hand leaving me breathless

take a look in these big blue eyes so you'll understand

And know why we whisper in hallways

I'll be with you always

Running together, forever you and I



PETER

There's something that I want to ask you

don't say "no" Just hear me out

After school they hold auditions

Something just to...think about



JASON

God, you asked the same thing last year

You know acting's not my thing

Plus I might go out for baseball

And I neither dance nor sing



PETER

You have never mentioned baseball

You haven't played since we were twelve

And as for "acting's not my thing"

It's obvious it's something else



JASON

I don't act



PETER

I think we're the best act this school has ever seen



JASON

So take a bow, and I'll-



PETER

You know what I mean

Just a thought, forget I brought it up



JASON

We'll think about it tonight

When everything is right

We'll shut off the lights

And cuddle in bed

And see how far we get



[Jason kisses Peter]



PETER

Is that supposed to shut me up?



JASON

Yea



PETER

Jerk



JASON

You and I

You take my hand leaving me breathless

take a look in these big blue eyes so you'll understand

And know why we whisper in hallways

I'll be with you always

Running together...



[a school bell rings]



...Miss me!



PETER

Forever you and I
