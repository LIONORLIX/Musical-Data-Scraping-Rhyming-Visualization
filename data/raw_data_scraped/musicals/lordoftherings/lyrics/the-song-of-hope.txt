The Song Of Hope


[ARWEN]

Undulv ily

Tier lom;

Ar caita morni

sindanriello

I falmalinnar imb met,

Oial



At the edge of darkness

Hope is whispering still,

Tender, unerring,

Gently stirring.



Memories unfurling in the mind.

Warm wind from a far, forgotten country,

Long left behind.

Wandering the empty road,

In twilight's silver shade,

Following the hidden paths

Lonely and afraid.

Let the sunlight free the heart,

Forever bound to roam,

And let the waking morning find

The weary traveller returning home.
