Now And For Always


[SAM]

Sing me a story of heroes of the Shire

Muddling through, brave and true

Stubborn as bindweed and tough as old brier

Never too showy or grand

Year after year they persevere

Now and for always

Harfoots who planted, and Stoor folk who ploughed

Bred to endure, slow but sure

Fallohide blood in your veins makes you proud

Sturdy and steady they stand

True to their aim to stay the same

Now and for always



[FRODO & SAM]

Sit by the firelight's glow

Tell us an old tale we know

Tell of adventures strange and rare

Never to change

Ever to share

Stories we tell will cast their spell

Now and for always



[SAM]

Sing me a story of Frodo and the ring

Fearless and bold

[FRODO]

Tired and cold

[SAM]

Sword at his side

An elf blade called sting

Crossing a miserable land

Wouldn't retreat

Just followed his feet

Now and for always



[FRODO & SAM]

Sit by the firelight's glow

Tell us an old tale we know

Tell of adventures strange and rare

Never to change

Ever to share

Stories we tell will cast their spell

Now and for always



[FRODO]

Sing me a tale of the bravest of them all

Comrade and guide, at my side

Stouthearted Sam who wouldn't let me fall

Holding my life in his hand

True to the end, no finer friend

Now and for always



[FRODO & SAM]

Sit by the firelight's glow

Tell us an old tale we know

Tell of adventures strange and rare

Never to change

Ever to share

Stories we tell will cast their spell

Now and for always
