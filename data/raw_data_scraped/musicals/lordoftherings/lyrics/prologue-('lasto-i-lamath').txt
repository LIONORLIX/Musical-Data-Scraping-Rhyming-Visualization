Prologue ('Lasto I Lamath')


i-ngwaew asia wintar

ar i ardh iaur ú dara.

erui men úvill

gomen amdiram

orthored i wath.



lasto i lamath

i lamath lin edair

ar u dhir tira,

last' inn tegitha



[Translation]



The winds of change blow

and the old world will not remain.

Separate we are vulnerable,

together we may hope to conquer the shadow.



Listen to the voices

on the wind,

the voices of your forefathers.

Do not be afraid!

There is a choice to make

and none can help you.

Listen, your instinct will lead you.
