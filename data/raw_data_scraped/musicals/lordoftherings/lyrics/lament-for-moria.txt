Lament For Moria


Gimli:

Hammer on anvil smote

In high halls of stone

When Durin ruled with judgement wise

On carven throne.

Gleaming the vaulted roof

From pure basalt grown.

Here swords were made of dreadful power

That ere was never known



Gimli/Gandalf:

Gone,lost, mourn, despair

Grieve for the realm that once was there.

Gone, lost, mourn, lament

The end of the glory none could prevent.
