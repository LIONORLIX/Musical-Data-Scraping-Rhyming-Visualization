My First Love Song


My first love song -

This is my first love song;

But it takes a poet to make a rhyme.



I'm not clever!

I could never ever

Think of phases worthy of you.

Each endeavor

I may make to sing your praises

May not sound as it should do.



But I love you -

Please believe I love you -

And I'd love the way poets do - to

Bring my love song

And sing my love song to you.



My first love song;

This is my first love song.

No one's ever needed my love before.



You're like I am -

All alone like I am

And in need of someone to care.



Poor like I am -

Like the lonely souls you read of,

You and I, we're a fine pair.



If you love me

I really love you

As you say you love me

I really care for you, dear.

I will be so happy to see you

Bring your love song

And sing your love song to me.



My first love song.

Sing your love song to me!
