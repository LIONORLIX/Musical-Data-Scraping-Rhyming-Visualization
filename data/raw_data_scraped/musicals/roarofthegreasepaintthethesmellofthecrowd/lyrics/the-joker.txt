The Joker


There's always a joker in the pack -

There's always a cardboard clown.

The poor painted fool falls on his back

And ev'ryone laughs when he's down.



There's always a funny man in the game;

But he's only funny by mistake;

But ev'ryone laughs at him just the same -

They don't see his painted heart break.



They don't care as long as there is a jester -

Just a fool - as foolish as he can be.

There's always a joker, that's a rule

But Fate deals the hand and I see -

The Joker is me!
