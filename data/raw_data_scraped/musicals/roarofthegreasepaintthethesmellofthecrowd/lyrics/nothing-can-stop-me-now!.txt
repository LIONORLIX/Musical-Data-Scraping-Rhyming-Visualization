Nothing Can Stop Me Now!


I don't believe it!

Pinch me to see if I am awake!

I can't believe it!

Wake me and say there's been a mistake!



No, don't! I'd sooner sleep on

In case - that is - until the dream has gone.

No, this is no dream, my friend.

This, it would seem,

Is where my troubles end.



Stand well back - I'm comin' through -

Nothing can stop me now!

Watch out, world - I'm warning you -

Nothing can stop me now!



Now I know that there is a Promised Land

I'm gonna find it, and how!

Hope is high and I'm gonna cling to it -

Tie ev'ry string to it -

Give ev'ry thing to it.



I'll make all my dreams come true

Before my final bow!

How I'll do it, who can say?

But I know I will someday.

Watch out, world - I'm on my way -

Nothing can stop me now!



I shall find success today -

Nothing can stop me now!

Yesterday was yesterday -

Nothing can stop me now!



Now I know the future is mine to have

I'm hereby makin' a vow!

From now on I'm gonna begin again -

Stick out my chin again -

Go in and win again!



Get you gone, you sky of grey!

Farewell, you furrowed brow!

Now my future's crystal clear!

No more woe for me to fear!

I'm gonna stand this world upon its ear -

And I'll succeed somehow!



I'll walk a million miles

For life's full of smiles.

Nothing can stop me now!
