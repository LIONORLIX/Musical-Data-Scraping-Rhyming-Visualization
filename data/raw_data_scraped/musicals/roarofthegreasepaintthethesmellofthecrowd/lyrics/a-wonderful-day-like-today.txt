A Wonderful Day Like Today


The second I saw it, I knew.

I said to myself: "Aha!"

I could tell at a glance

That it wasn't by chance

That we happened to be where we are.



From the moment I woke with the lark,

We were both of us singing away,

And the sky was so blue

I instinctively knew

We were in for a wonderful day.



As I told you before

When I saw what I saw,

I was terribly tempted to say:



On a wonderful day like today,

I defy any cloud to appear in the sky,

Dare any raindrop to plop in my eye

On a wonderful day like today.



On a wonderful morning like this

When the sun is as big as a yellow balloon;

Even the sparrows are signing in tune

On a wonderful morning like this.



On a morning like this I could kiss ev'rybody,

I'm so full of love and good will.

Let me say furthermore, I'd adore ev'rybody

To come and dine -- the pleasure's mine --

And I will play the bill!



May I take this occasion to say

That the whole human race

Should go down on its knees,

Show that we're grateful

For mornings like these

For the world's in a wonderful way

On a wonderful day like today.



On a wonderful day like today

When the sky is as grey as an elephant's's nose,

Half of me's freezing - the other half's froze!

On a wonderful day like today - I'm only joking!



May I take this occasion to pray

For a little less cold and a little more heat.

Even the sparrows are stamping their feet;

If they spoke I know just what they'd say!

On a wonderful day like today.



On a wonderful day ...

Yes, Sir, what did you say?

A fantabulous day!

Don't get carried away.

On a wonderful day like today!
