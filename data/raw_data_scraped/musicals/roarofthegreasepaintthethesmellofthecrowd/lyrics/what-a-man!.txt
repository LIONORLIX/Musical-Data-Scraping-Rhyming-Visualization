What A Man!


What a wonderful feller! What a prince! What a saint!



What a man! What a man!

You are more like a god than a man!

What a prize! What a pearl!

What a wonderful capture for some lucky girl!



That finesse! That physique!

Make a rare combination you don't see

Each day of the week.

It's so chic, entre-nous,

To be friends with a fabulous man like you.



Thank you, Cocky, I don't know what to say, except it's your move.



Ah, what a man! What a man!

Like a statue of Mars with a tan.

You've got brains! You've got brawn!

You were blessed by the gods

From the day you were born.



So polite! Such panache!

Such a style of your own, it's no wonder you cut such a dash!

Never brash - always so!

You're by far the most marvelous man I know.



He's a thing beyond worth.

Without doubt the most outstanding,

Downright and upstanding,

Forthright and highstanding man.



What a man!

Who me? Yes, you.

It's true; I am.

What a man he is! Oh, what a man!
