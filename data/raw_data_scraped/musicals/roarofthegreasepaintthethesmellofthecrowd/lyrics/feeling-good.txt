Feeling Good


Bird flying high - you know how I feel.

Sun in the sky - you know how I feel.

Breeze drifting by - you know how I feel.

It's a new dawn; it's a new day;

It's a new life for me.

Feeling good.



Fish in the sea - you know how I feel.

River running free - you know how I feel.

Blossom on the tree - you know how I feel.

It's a new dawn; it's a new day;

It's a new life for me.

Feeling good.



Dragonfly out in the sun - you know what I mean.

Butterflies all having fun - you know what I mean.

Sleep in peace when day is done - that's what I mean;

And this old world is a new world

And a bold world for me.



Stars when you shine - you know how I feel.

Scent of the pine - you know how I feel.

Freedom is mine - I know how I feel.

It's a new dawn; it's a new day;

It's a new life for me.

Feeling good.
