This Dream


This dream -

I have this wonderful dream where I win -

Where I win ev'ry battle I fight,

And I kill ev'ry dragon in sight.



Each night I lie awake

And I wait for this dream.

What a world I create when I dream

I'm not lonely -

A pity it's only a dream;



But such a fabulous dream

That I feel

That the real world is really unreal,

While the wildest of dreams

Can come true. They do;

But they only come true in this dream.
