That's What It Is To Be Young


And now poor Bertie's dead

And his requiem's been sung

We must admit we're bloody glad

To be alive and young. Alive and young.



Fresh as an April morning,

Soft as a tulip's tongue,

Clear as the gleam of a mountain stream;

That's what it is to be young.



Warm as a summer sunrise,

Sweet as an evening breeze,

Pure as a note from a songbird's throat,

Rich as the green of the trees,



Strong as the bite of a frosty night,

Bold as a big brass band,

Keen as a bean or a young sardine --

Not very keen to be canned,



Bright as a newborn bluebell,

New as a song unsung,

Free as the breeze on the seven seas;

That's what it is to be young.
