Look at That Face


Look at that face -

Just look at it,

Look at that fabulous face of yours.

I knew first look I took at it,

This was the face that the world adores.



Look at those eyes -

As wise and as deep as the sea.

Look at that nose -

It shows what a nose should be.



As for your smile, it's lyrical -

Friendly and warm as a summer's day -

That face is just a miracle.

Where could I ever find words to say



The way that it makes me happy

Whatever the time or place?

I'll find in no book

What I find when I look

At that face.



Look at that face -

Just look at it.

Look at that funny old face of yours.

I knew first look I took at it

You've got a face like a kitchen door's.



Look at those eyes -

As close as the closest of friends.

Look at that nose -

It starts where a good nose ends.



As for your smile - spectacular!

One grin would frighten the birds away.

You've got a face like Dracula!

And I mean that in the nicest way!



To say that there's no one like you

Would not even state the case.

No wonder I shook

When I first took a look

At that face.
