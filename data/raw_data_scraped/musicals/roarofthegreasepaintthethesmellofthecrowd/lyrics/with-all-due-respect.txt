With All Due Respect


The roar of the greasepaint - the smell of the..

No, no, no, no --



With all due respect, Sir,

I'd like to say a word or three

About the way you're treating me

In front of ev'ryone.



You say I lay about and shirk,

You must take me for such a jerk,

'Cause I do all the bleeding work

While you have all the fun.



Far be it from me, Sir,

To dare to carp or criticize.

I just want you to realize

I don't do this for exercise.



I just want you to see, Sir,

How wicked and unfair it is.

I dunno why, but there it is.

It's more than I can bear;

And, frankly, I object -

That is, with due respect.



Forgive my presumption;

I know that you're a gentleman,

A slightly temperamental man,

A man of intellect.



But I suspect that your neglect

Is largely why my health is wrecked.

No ifs or buts; I hate your guts,

With all due respect.



I don't wish to be rude, Sir,

But ev'rything I do is wrong.

You make me feel I don't belong

Because I dropped off in your song.



Please give me some food, Sir,

A bit of bread and cheese will do

Or maybe just a crust or two,

But something I can chew.

He feeds me once a week;

I'm much too weak to speak.



Permit me to say, Sir,

I've had about enough of it.

I always get the rough of it,

So what could you expect?

You must detect the bad effect

You've had upon my self-respect.



A bleedin' shame,

But who's to blame?

With all due respect.



My mind you have mastered;

You sit there half plastered.

You aren't half a ...

Cocky!

With all due respect.

With all due respect!
