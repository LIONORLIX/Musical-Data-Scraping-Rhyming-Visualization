Things to Remember (reprise)


When I think of the era in which I was raised

And I see how the world's gone to waste,

I confess that I'm constantly shocked and amazed

At man's singular lack of good taste.



For taste is like justice - we live by her laws.

It's so easy to tell right from wrong.

Most people don't bother;

Most people are whores.

And a few bores who do, don't for long.



There are so many things I remember

From the deeply revered days of old

When living was gentle and gracious

And working folk did as they're told.



They were wonderful days, I remember,

When a feller could live like a king;

And children were working in coal mines

And life was a beautiful thing.



But the fortunes of mankind are changing;

Things aren't what they were anymore;

And although I'm in no way complaining,

By Harris and Tweed, I preferred it before.



Ah, but why think of May in November

When December is all that you'll get?

Man lives with a lingering ember

And while there are beautiful things to remember

The ugly things one should forget!
