A Way Back To Then


HEIDI



Dancing in the backyard

Kool-aid moustache and butterfly wings

Hearing Andrea McArdle sing

From the hi-fi in the den

I've been waiting my whole life

To find a way back to then



I aimed for the sky

A nine-year-old can see so far

I'll conquer the world and be a star

I'll do it all by the time I'm ten

I would know that confidence

If I knew a way back to then



So I bailed on my hometown

And became a college theatre dork

I was eastbound and down

Moving to New York

So I crammed my life in a U-Haul

To find my part of it all



But the mundane sets in

We play by the rules

And plough through the days

The years take us miles away

From the time we wondered when

We'd find a way back to then



And when you least expect

Opportunity walks through the door

You suddenly connect

With the thing that you forgot

That you were looking for



And there you are

Right in the middle of what you love

With the craziest of company

You're having a kick-ass time

And being who you wanted to be in this world



You're that little girl

With her wings unfurled

Flying again

Back in your backyard dancing

I found a way back to then.
