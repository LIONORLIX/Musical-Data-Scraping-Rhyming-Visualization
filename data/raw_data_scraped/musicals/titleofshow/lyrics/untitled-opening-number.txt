JEFF

A, D, D, D, D, F sharp, A

Will be the first notes of our show



HUNTER

We’ll start with the seed of an idea



BOTH

Then plant it on a paper

With a Dixon Ticonderoga

And then watch it sprout into a musical

And then we’ll help to make it grow’.

Bigger



Nothing guarantees it will stand out

And its future is unknown



JEFF

So in the meantime we will schedule

A lot of meetings in Hell’s Kitchen



HUNTER

To collaborate in my living room



BOTH

But we can’t do it all alone



HEIDI AND SUSAN

So



JEFF AND HUNTER/ HEIDI AND SUSAN

We’ll get together all our friends/ Ahh’

And exploit all of their talents/ Ahh’

We’ll explore the latest trends/ Ahh’

And avoid them when we balance the/ Ahh’



JEFF AND HUNTER

HEIDI AND SUSAN

Book with the score



ALL

The score with a lyric

Appealing to the judge

Gently nudging the satiric



JEFF, HEIDI, AND SUSAN

Ahh’



HUNTER/ JEFF, HEIDI, AND SUSAN

We’re trying hard not to duplicate/ Ooo’

What we’ve seen and heard before/ Ooo’

And if Bartyk’s here, he’ll appreciate/ Ooo’

If we’re inventive with the score/ Ooo’



ALL

So we’ll put in a syncopation

And we’ll add a quarter’ note

And we’ll softly start the coda from a very tiny point

And then we’ll get a little louder to further emphasize the point

And then we’ll cross downstage toward you



JEFF AND SUSAN

And now we yell in fortissimo’



HUNTER

Yell in fortissimo’



HEIDI

Yell in fortissimo’



ALL

(Fortissim)o’oh’.

It’s the opening song

It doesn’t have a title, no!

And it’s not very long

But it’s the starting point of our musical

And here’s the first scene of our musical
