Part Of It All


HUNTER

A part of steadying a life that seems unstable

With a paycheck in my pocket to help me pay the rent

A part of being fine with splurging on the cable

And no more phone calls to unemployment



JEFF

A part of ducking out before the show’s finale

To get to the opening night at Tavern On the Green

A part of my sheet music on sale in Schubert Ally

And a trendy photo shoot for a homo magazine



BOTH

All our gay skills

Filling playbills

We’ll be part of it all



HUNTER

A part of our poster on display in Triton Gallery



JEFF

And a couple of tourist taking its picture by the street



HUNTER

A part of negotiating my personal trainer’s salary



JEFF

And a part of forgetting the names of everyone we meet



BOTH

If we need a

House seat the theatre

We’ll get it cause the Nederlanders know we're part of it all



JEFF/HUNTER

Part of it all/ Part of it all



BOTH

Part of it all

Part of it all



There’ll come a day when we look back at the time we spent writing this very show

Our attempt to stay above the derivatal tricks and the critical undertoe

Our show, though small

Will have been part of it all



Part of fans to captivate

Part of the press to navigate

Part of Lunch with Bernadette

Part of a coat of Marmasette



JEFF/ HUNTER

Part of a night to stare at your/ super awesome Sardi's caricature/



HUNTER/ JEFF

Part of the roar in MGM/ Part of

Part of a Star in Bethlehem/ It all



BOTH

Part of it all

Part of it all

Part of it all



JEFF

A part of dreading the day they post the closing notice



HUNTER

A part of wanting to throw the towel in now and then



BOTH

A part of knowing that the way we’ll stay afloat is

To rise back up and just start over again



We be part of it all
