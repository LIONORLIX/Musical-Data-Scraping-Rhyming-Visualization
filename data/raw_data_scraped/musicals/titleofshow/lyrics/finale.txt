So? im ready to put the show out there, how do we end it?



Hunter

Good question, we can’t just keep adding in everything that happens to us



Jeff

Lets just step off’ lets just put the show out there and see what happens



Hunter

Sounds good to me



(sung)

Jeff & Hunter / Heidi & Susan

Oh, it’s the end of the road / oh, oh

Oh, what a long road we hold / oh, oh



All

And now we (now we) have to let go

This is the last line of our’ show
