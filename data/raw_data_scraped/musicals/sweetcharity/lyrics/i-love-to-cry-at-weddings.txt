I Love to Cry at Weddings


Herman:

Tomorrow when you say "I do" I'll die,

I'm almost too ashamed to tell you why...

I love to cry at weddings,

How I love to cry at weddings

I walk into a chapel and get happily hysterical,

The ushers and attendants,

The family dependants,

I see them and I start to sniff,

Have you an extra handkerchief?

And all through the service

While the bride and groom look nervous

Tears of joy are streaming down my face.

I love to cry at weddings, anybody's wedding

Any time! Anywhere! Anyplace!

Girl:

I always weep at wedding

I must sob and weep at weddings

Oh, all is sweet and sloppy

And all "promise me" and all that jazz

Girls:

The man you rest your head with

The man you share your bed with

Is married too

And so, you know, will jump up

And dress and blow

I could marry Herman

And be permanently sorry

All:

We would make a really lousy pair

Nickie:

But, Gee, I want a wedding, any kind of wedding

All:

Any time, anywhere, any place!

I love to cry at weddings

How I love to cry at weddings

I walk into a chapel and get happily hysterical

The ushers and attendants

The family dependants

I see them and I start to sniff

Have you an extra handkerchief?

And all through the service

While the bride and groom are nervous

I drink champagne and sing "Sweet Adeline"!

Ha Ha Ha!

I love to cry at weddings

Anybody's wedding

Just as long as it's not mine!

I love to cry at weddings

Anybody's wedding

Any time, anywhere, anyplace
