Finale


Ensemble:

If they could see me now,

That little gang of mine,

I'm eating fancy chow

And drinking fancy wine.

I'd like those stumble bums to see for a fact

The kind of top drawer, first rate chums I attract.

All I can say is "Wow-ee!

Looka where I am.

Tonight I landed, pow!

Right in a pot of jam.

What a set up! Holy cow!

They'd never believe it,

If my friends could see me now!

All I can say is "Wow-ee!

Looka where I am.

Tonight I landed, pow!

Right in a pot of jam.

What a set up! Holy cow!

They'd never believe it,

If my friends could see me now!
