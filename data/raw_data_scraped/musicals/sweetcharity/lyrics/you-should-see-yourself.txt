You Should See Yourself


Charity:

Man! Man, oh, man!

Tst, tst, tst!

You should see yourself like tonight

You're a hundred watt "elecatric" light.

You're a blockbuster buster you got class

And when you make a pass

Man, it's a pass!

Mad ooh sack, you're mad!

Mmm, mmm!

How those corny jokes turn me on!

And I laugh till I'm "ga, ga, ga, ga, GONE!"

When you switch to a "seducative" mood

I'm not stuck on you, lover!

I am glued...

In the college I brought up the outwit

Do I wilt, boy are you built?

You're so strong you've got muscles you don't need

Yes, yes, indeed!

Wild, dad, you're wild!

Rrrrrrrrrrrh!

You should see yourself in my eyes.

You're a Blue Ribbon Puli-i-tzer Prize...

Hey, do you know what I did today?

I went looking for furniture!

Bedroom sets, kitchen sets, bedroom sets!

Dining-room sets, "bedroom sets"...

And I got all the money from the damn payment

right here, my dowry!

Dreams I had not...

Dreams now I got!

You're old glory man, oh, yes you are!

In my flag you're the "fi-fi-fi-fifty" star

You should see yourself

And inspect yourself...

Hey, get a mirror, man!

And reflect yourself...

You should see yourself

As I see you now...
