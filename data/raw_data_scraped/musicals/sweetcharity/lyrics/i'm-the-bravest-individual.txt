I'm the Bravest Individual


Charity:

When I'm so jittery my knees buckle,

Ice water tickles my spine,

I 'm trapped like a butterfly in a net

Then I say to myself:

I'm the bravest individual

I have ever met.

Oscar:

I'm the bravest individual

I have ever met.

Charity:

This game makes very good sense

I get results

Oscar:

Isn't that great!

Charity:

Get back my confidence

And then even pulse seventy-eight

So when I panic and feel each day

I come to the end of the line

Then I say that fear hasn't licked me yet

I keep telling myself

I'm the bravest individual

I have ever met

Oscar:

Funny, but suddenly I can't swallow

I think I'm going to die

Sometimes, if you pardon the word, I sweat!

Charity:

Then you say to yourself,

"I'm the bravest individual

I have ever met."

Oscar:

I'm the bravest individual

I have ever met

Charity:

Good!

Oscar:

Your game makes very good sense

I get results

Charity:

Isn't that fine?

Oscar:

Got back my confidence and then

Even pulse a hundred and nine

Charity:

So when you panic and think each day

You fail at whatever you try

Oscar:

I just say that fear hasn't licked me yet!

Charity:

And keep telling yourself

Oscar:

I'm the strongest, soundest stoical,

Daringest manliest, most heroical

I'm the bravest individual

Both:

I have ever met!
