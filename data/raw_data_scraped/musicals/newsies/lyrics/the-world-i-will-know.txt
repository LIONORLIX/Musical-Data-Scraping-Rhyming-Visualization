The World I Will Know


JACK:

Pulitzer and Hearst

They think we're nothin'

Are we nothin'?



NEWSIES:

No!



JACK:

Pulitzer and Hearst

They think they got us

Do they got us?



NEWSIES:

No!



JACK:

Even though we ain't got hats or badges

We're a union just by saying so

And the world will know!



What's it gonna take to stop the wagons?

Are we ready?



NEWSIES:

Yeah!



JACK:

What's it gonna take to stop the scabbers?

Can we do it?



NEWSIES:

Yeah!



JACK:

We'll do what we gotta do

Until we break the will of mighty Bill and Joe



NEWSIES:

And the World will know

And the Journal too

Mister Hearst and Pulitzer

Have we got news for you

Now the world will hear

What we got to say

We been hawkin' headlines

But we're makin' 'em today

And our ranks will grow



CRUTCHY:

And we'll kick their rear



NEWSIES:

And the world will know

That we been here



JACK:

When the circulation bell starts ringin'

Will we hear it?



NEWSIES:

No!



JACK:

What if the Delanceys come out swingin'

Will we hear it?



NEWSIES:

No!

When you got a hundred voices singin'

Who can hear a lousy whistle blow?

And the world will know

That this ain't no game

That we got a ton of rotten fruit and perfect aim

So they gave their word

But it ain't worth beans

Now they're gonna see

What "stop the presses" really means

And the day has come

And the time is now

And the fear is gone



BOOTS:

And our name is mud



NEWSIES:

And the strike is on



BOOTS:

And I can't stand blood



NEWSIES:

And the world will ?



JACK:

Pulitzer may own the World but he don't own us!



NEWSIES:

Pulitzer may own the World but he don't own us!



JACK:

Pulitzer may crack the whip but he won't whip us!



NEWSIES:

Pulitzer may crack the whip but he won't whip us!

And the world will know

And the world will learn

And the world will wonder how we made the tables turn

And the world will see

That we had to choose

That the things we do today will be tomorrow's news

And the old will fall

And the young stand tall

And the time is now

And the winds will blow

And our ranks will grow and grow and grow and so

The world will feel the fire

And finally know!
