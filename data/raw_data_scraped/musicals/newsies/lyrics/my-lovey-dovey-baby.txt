My Lovey-Dovey Baby


ANNOUNCER:(Speaking)

And now gents, the moment you've all been waiting for.

The sensational songbird. The Swedish Meadowlark, Miss Medda Larkson.



MEDDA:

My lovey dovey baby

I boo-hoo-hoo for you

I used to be your tootsie-wootsie

Then you said 'tooldle-dedoo'



I miss the hanky-panky

Each nighty-night til three

Come back my lovey dovey baby

And coochie-coo with me



Our life was ducky-wucky

So goody-good were we

Come back, my lovey-dovey baby

And coochie-coo with me
