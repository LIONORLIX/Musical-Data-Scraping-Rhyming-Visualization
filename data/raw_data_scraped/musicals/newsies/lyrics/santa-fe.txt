Santa Fe


JACK:

So that's what they call a family

Mudder, fadder, daughter, son

Guess everything you heard about is true.

So you ain't got any family

Well,who said you needed one?

Ain'tcha glad nobody's waiting up for you?

When I dream on my own

I'm alone, but I ain't lonely

For a dreamer, night's the only time of day

When the city's finally sleeping

When my thoughts begin to stray

And I'm on the train that bound for

Santa Fe

And I'm free

Like the wind

Like Im gonna live forever.

It's a feeling time can never take away

All I needs a few more dollars

And I'm outta here to stay

Dreams come true

Yes they do

In Santa Fe

Where does it say you've gotta live and die here?

Where does it say a guy can't catch a break?

Why should you only take what you're given?

Why should you spend your whole life livin'

Trapped where there ain't no future

Even at seventeen

Breaking your back for someone else's sake

If the life don't seem to suit ya

HOw bout a change of scene?

Far from the lously headlines

And the deadlines in between

Santa Fe

Are you there?

Do you swear you won't forget me?

If I found you would you let me come and stay?

I ain't getting any younger

And before my dying day

I want space

Not just air

Let 'em laugh in my face, I don't care

Save a place

I'll be there

So that's what they call a family?

Ain'tcha glad you ain't that way?

Ain'tcha glad you got a dream called

Santa Fe?
