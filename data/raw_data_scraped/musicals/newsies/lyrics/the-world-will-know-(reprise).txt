The World Will Know (Reprise)


LES: [sung] When the circulation bell starts ringing, will we hear it?



RACETRACK: [spoken] Nah!



[sung] What if the Delanceys come out swinging, will we hear it?



LES: [spoken] No!



COMPANY: [sung]

When you've got a million voices singing who could hear a lousy whistle blow?



And the world will know!



The world will feel the fire and finally know!!!
