Prologue


Racetrack:

In 1899, the streets of New York echoed with the voices of Newsies.

Peddeling the papers of Joseph Pulitizer,

William Randolph Hearst, and other giants of the newspaper world.

On every corner you heard them carrying the banner.

Bringing you the news for a penny a pape.

Poor orphans and runaways, the newsies were a ragged army, withour a leader.

Until one day, all that changed.
