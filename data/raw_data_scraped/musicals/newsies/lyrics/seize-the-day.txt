Seize the Day


DAVID:

Open the gates and seize the day

Don?t be afraid and don?t delay

Nothing can break us

No one can make us

Give our rights away

Arise and seize the day!

DAVID AND NEWSIES:

Now is the time to seize the day

(Now is the time to seize the day)

Send out the call and join the fray

(Send out the call and join the fray)

DAVID:

Wrongs will be righted

if we?re united

DAVID AND NEWSIES:

Let us seize the day!

Friends of the friendless seize the day

(Friends of the friendless seize the day)

Raise up the torch and light the way

(Raise up the torch and light the way)

Proud and defiant

We?ll slay the giant

Let us seize the day

Neighbor to neighbor

Father to son

One for all and all for one!

Open the gates and seize the day

(Open the gates and seize the day)

Don?t be afraid and don?t delay

(don?t be afraid and don?t delay)

Nothing can break us

No one can make us

Give our rights away

Neighbor to neighbor

Father to son!

One for all and all for one!
