Carrying the Banner (Finale)


Try Bottle Alley or the harbor

Try Central Park, it's guaranteed

Try any banker, bum, or barber ...

They almost all knows how to read!

Summer stinks and winter's waiting

Welcome to New York

Boy, ain't nature fascinating

When youse gotta walk?



Group 1:

It's a fine life

Carrying the banner

It's a fine life

Carrying the banner

It's a fine life

Carrying the banner

It's a fine life

Carrying the banner



Group 2:

You got 'em Cowboy

You showed 'em now, boy!

Go get 'em, Cowboy!

You got 'em now, boy!
