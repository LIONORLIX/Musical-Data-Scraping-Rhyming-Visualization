I Don't Wanna Miss A Thing


Isn't it amazing

I can feel this great like the whole worlds waiting on me



When I snap my fingers people all count out

And I guess thats how it was meant to be



My futures near so I'm aiming straight ahead

Cause it's all garenteed I will get what I need

Like my parents always said



I'm telling you (uh oh)

I don't wanna miss a thing (no)

I know I can have it all (whoa)

I want the american dream

My mom and dad both promised

That I'll have it on a string

I'll be living in bliss

And I don't wanna miss a thing



Everyday is Christmas

The whole year long and theres nothing wrong about that



I get all I ask for

From a teddy bear to a troll doll wearing a pill box heat



As for my goals theres no secret in my search

Be a mother and wife for the rest of my life

With a few short breaks for church



So sing it now (uh oh)

I don't wanna miss a thing (no)

I'm not gunna be denied (whoa)

I want the american dream

And I'll have the perfect husband

And the perfect diamond ring

Moving on with a kiss

And I don't wanna miss a thing



I wanna have a couple kids

I wanna join a country club

I wanna live just like a queen

I'm Miss America



I wanna bake a casserole

I wanna make a jello mold

I wanna cook but never clean

I wanna have the perfect house

I wanna aford the perfect Tv set

i wanna look like Doris Day



I wanna man to cherish me

I wanna man whos organized

I wanna man who listens when I say

Now listen to me baby



(Uh oh)

I don't wanna miss a thing (no)

I don't wanna miss the bus (whoa)

I want the american dream

And together we will grab it

And together we will sing



Nothings better than this

Nothings better than this

I don't wanna miss

I don't wanna miss no

i don't wanna miss a thing
