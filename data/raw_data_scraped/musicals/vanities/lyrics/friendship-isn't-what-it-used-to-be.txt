Friendship Isn't What It Used To Be


Three pretty girls in a schoolyard

Playin' games and makin' noise

You would think they had been best friends forever

Talkin' algebra and boys



They were each of them after the big brass ring

So they swore they'd never be apart

And if it rang a little false...

Still, it was said with all their heart



Laughing, dancing,

Off on a spree!

No one knew that none of it meant a thing...

But friendship isn't what it used to be



Three college girls at the movies

Falling hard for Steve McQueen

You would think that they had so much in common

If you stumbled on the scene



Then you peel back the layers of teenage ties

And a lot of what they shared is gone

We left each other far behind

And never noticed we moved on



Life flows, time flies

Spirits roam free

No one says it and nothing dies

But friendship isn't what it used to be



Wouldnt you know some of us grow

Some of us stay the way we are

And love burns out after making it so far



Three women stuck at a crossroads,

At a loss to reconnect...

You would think them a mess of contradictions,

And for once you'd be correct



It's apparent that none of us made the grade

But at least not in the way we planned

But how we lost our common ground

Is what I'll never understand



Years race, lives change,

Makes sense to me...

Why the hell should it feel so strange?

All relationships rearranged!

And the fact is, some friends don't fade

Some... You never see.



Make your peace with the choices made,

Swallow hard at the price you've paid...



But friendship...

Isn't what it used to be.
