You Said You Loved Me


Heidi

You said you loved me

Now I know you could love anyone

Remember how ou said that love was fun

Well you don't think love's always fun, do you?

What do you expect me to do?



Nicky

What?



Heidi

You said you loved me

Well now we both know you never did

And now you show up, I say grow up kid

Slow up kid, cool down

We never clicked enough for you to ever stick around

It's true

Don't try to make it work with me

And start to work on you



Nicky

Well don't expect me too



Heidi

There's so much work to do

Oh, you said you loved me



Nicky

I did



Heidi

But now there's really nothing left to say



Nicky

Come on



Heidi

No more lying, no more games to play



Nicky

Heidi, you don't understand



Heidi

Keep on trying, you might be OK



Nicky

I can't



Heidi

Really, Nicky, start today

Rub yourself, and you're on your way
