Smile Through the Pain


CHARLIE

I?m getting out

I mean I gotta take a break

Sit by a man made lake

Watch the day turn into dark

Pepper?s really out of whack

So here I am in Central Park

Nicky?s never coming back

She asked me for hand

And so I told her, ?Listen Kiddo

He?s just a month long stand

Try not to play the grieving widow?

So I got my new shades for the lonely guy

And the pretty boys on roller blades go by



Hi.



ALAN

Hi.



CHARLIE

I don?t mean to be intrusive

But did you go the exclusive

Camp Pinecone?



ALAN

Camp Pinecone? Oh, yeah.



CHARLIE

Camp Pinecone?s for the lads and lasses

Of the upper middle classes

Get your children off their asses

Parents spend some time alone

Your boys go hiking, girls ride horses

While you settle your divorces

The best camp in the world of course is Camp Pinecone



ALAN

I did something illegal with Jessica Seagal

She made faces when my braces got caught up in her tights



CHARLIE

Experiments with Noah Schwartz

On evenings on the tennis courts

We?d both remove our boxer shorts



BOTH

Those awkward summer nights



CHARLIE

Remember you and me in the talent show?

Can?t remember?



ALAN

I don?t know



CHARLIE

We did our old vaudeville routine

A lot has happened in between



ALAN

You were my straight man



CHARLIE

Not as of late man



ALAN

We were the Martin and Lewis of Maine



CHARLIE

Remember our song?



ALAN

Smile through the pain



BOTH

We?re Chuck and Al and we don?t suck



ALAN

I was Al



CHARLIE

And I was Chuck



Don?t you ever feel like there?s only five people in the world sometimes?



So what do you do now?



ALAN

I teach children Hebrew

And there?s a beautiful Jew now

That I like to pursue

And her father is sick

And her boyfriend?s a dick



CHARLIE

What?s her name?



ALAN

Heidi.



CHARLIE

What?s his name?



ALAN

Nick.



CHARLIE

Ahh.



Everyone knows everyone wherever you go

New York?s the biggest little town I know



ALAN

So what?s up Chuck? Having girl trouble?



CHARLIE

Well, yes, Al. Yes I am.



ALAN

That?s funny. I always thought you were a little? um? you know.



CHARLIE

Homosexual, Al?



ALAN

Sure. Homosexual sounds about right to me.



CHARLIE

Well to be honest Al, I don?t know what I am.



ALAN

That?s all right. You know what the say, you just gotta smile through the pain!



Things are rough, well don?t you suffer

Had enough? The tough get tougher

When your love life?s not a lot

Don?t get caught in the rain

Don?t pretend you?re Rockefeller

The more you spend the les you tell her



BOTH

If you joke when you go broke

You won?t hear her complain

After a while

You?re learning to smile

Through the pain



CHARLIE

Not too hip, you?re feeling shabby

Forgot to tip your favorite cabby

Before you drown in bathtub gin

Begin to win, abstain



ALAN

Life?s a show with no admission

What?chu know ?bout prohibition



BOTH

Don?t be a slug, unplug that tub

And pour it down the drain

After a while

You?re learning to smile

Through the pain



CHARLIE

(weird noises)



ALAN

(laughs)

You like that move?



CHARLIE

Watch this.



ALAN

You just touched my ass.



CHARLIE

Hey.



ALAN

(laughs)



CHARLIE

Couldn?t help.



BOTH

So when you want it go and get it

What?s to know? You know don?t sweat it

It?s time you faced it?s wrong to waste

That super duper brain



Don?t be a poop, it?s time to do it

Get off the stoop and get into it

You see your life go loop-dee-loop

The scoop is ?Don?t Complain?

After a while

You?re learning to smile

Through the pain



After a while

You?re learning to smile

Through the pain
