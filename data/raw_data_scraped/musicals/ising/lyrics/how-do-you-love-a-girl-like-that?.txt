How Do You Love a Girl Like That?


Jenny was an artist

She couldn't even cook

She'd sit up all night reading

With a fountain pen and book held in her hand



Jenny said that little boys don't understand a thing

They don't know how to love she said

They just know how to sing

And I tried to talk it over

But she stared at me and sat

And I said what's a boy to do with a girl like that?

How do you love a girl like that?



Mary was a writer

She'd give me things to read

They were stories filled with apathy

And bitterness and greed on every page

Mary said my rage was all so thinly disguised

I said I feel just fine and there's no need to analyze

I threw her books away and in a day she left me flat

And I said what's a boy to do with a girl like that?

How do you love a girl like that?



How do you love a girl without a spine of her own?

How do you love a girl who doesn't mind being alone

Every night

They think that it's all right when it's all wrong

Jesus Christ they all just wanna get along

But love is a mess

And love is a wreck

And what's it all about?

I'm moving on

I'm moving out



April was to eager

May wasn't any fun

And making love to June was like deflowering a nun

And Jacqueline was far too thin

And Jill was getting fat

And Heidi is too...

And Heidi is too...

Heidi

How do you love a girl like that?
