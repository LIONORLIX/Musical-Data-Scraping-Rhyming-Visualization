I Sing


NICKY

I sing

Cause my future?s uncertain



HEIDI

I sing

Cause my song?s still unsung



ALAN

I?m alive and alert



PEPPER

And I pull back the curtain



CHARLIE

I sing I?m abrasive and young



ALL

I sing



NICKY

Cause my heart is still beating



ALL

I sing



HEIDI

Cause my story?s untold



CHARLIE

Who know?s where it?s leading?



ALAN

My hairline?s receding



PEPPER

I sing I don?t wanna grow old



ALL

I sing

Cause we?re barely beginning



MEN

I sing

Someone show me a sign



WOMEN

Who knows if I?m winning?

I?m in the first inning



MEN

I sing cause my life?s on the line



ALAN

But what do I do when there?s no one around

And I?m tearing my hair out and hitting the ground



CHARLIE AND NICKY

I?m ready for action

I?m always on call



CHARLIE

I?m on the attack

But my back?s to the wall



PEPPER

There?s so much to sing for

And so far to fall



ALL

Either it?s real or it?s nothing all

I sing cause I?m lonely

I sing cause I?m free

I won?t be the only one singing for me



NICKY

I rise at six and send a fax

I call the pricks at Goldman Sacs

I?m lucky if I make it out by ten

I get tickets for my bosses

And I wonder what did he pay?

So I try to cut my losses

And I auction them on eBay

Then wake up and do it all again

But I?m climbing higher

In the corporate ranking

Please let me retire

From investment banking

When will they loosen

The noose on our throats?

For my ulcer?s been growing

My pulse overflowing

I can?t call this sewing my oats



I sing

For the Protestant ethic

My wasp

Manifests destiny

The good old boy network

Will help me to get work

But who?s gonna help me break free?

I sing



CHARLIE

From Aspen in ski pants

To Paris to see France

To New York to freelance

A magazine

From Chelsea?s last pier dance

With hip-hop and queer trance

The places and faces

This fag has seen

My daddy died when I was ten

And left my half his cash

Now I tip out from my trust fund

To the bar back down at Splash



I sing

For my childhood regression

I sing

When I?m down on all fours

I?m still doing poppers

Attention all shoppers

I?m singing come take me, I?m yours

I sing



PEPPER

The shortest skirt in Riverdale

I?m such a flirt, my liver?d fail

I?m such a dirty drunk

I flunked my bachelor?s degree

My passion to cash-in got me the boot

Out of the Fashion Institute of Technology

But now they pay me by the night

To go somewhere that?s always the rage

And put on something much too tight

And shake my ass inside a cage

My life is a mess

But, I?m dressed to impress

I?m trendy

I?m bendy

I?m fun

I?m MTV?s typical motor boater

Fit apolitical club promoter

Flyer anyone?



I sing

With my Nokia cellphone

I sing

While I?m tapping the keg

I bought a new dildo

Who knows how far we?ll go?

I sing for my vibrating egg

I sing



HEIDI

I am Barbara Streisand

In the body of an elf

I never liked my thighs and

I feel bad about myself

There?s twelve unfinished screenplays

On my shelf collecting dust

I don?t wanna temp forever

No, it?s mere a max or bust

I feel like Laura Efron when I start out

Then I grab the Teflon and I stir fry my heart out

I like to cook

I love to eat

I crave domestic bliss

But no one ever told me

At my girl?s camp and the cat skill?s

There?d be year like this



I sing

For the stupid Stairmaster

I sing

For the workout at Crunch

I sing about futons

And Caesars with croutons

And snack wells with Prozac for Lunch

I sing



ALAN

We went to Vaster

Passed a class or two

Did a little Riddelin

And kid, we skid it through

I tried my hand at show biz

They said we?ll call don?t call us

So I traded in my toe shoes

For a torah and a tallus

Now I teach the Talmud

And I take what I can get

And the children of Manhattan

Learn the Hebrew alphabet



I sing

For the Carnegie Deli

I sing

For pastrami on rye

I sing for my parents in Shortlis, New Jersey

Baruch hata adonai



ALAN AND HEIDI

I sing

For my wildest obsessions



PEPPER AND CHARLIE

I sing

For the beauty in truth



MEN

I sing my confessions

Romantic depressions



WOMEN

I sing for the ideals of youth



ALAN AND HEIDI

I sing

Cause I?m still optimistic



PEPPER AND CHARLIE

I sing

I don?t know who I?ll be



ALAN

I?m not who I was

And I?m singing because

I don?t know who I am but I gotta be me



CHARLIE AND ALAN

But what do I do when there?s nobody there

And I?m throwing a fit with my fist in the air



NICKY AND PEPPER

I?m ready for something and someone to call



CHARLIE AND HEIDI

I?m losing my mind but I?m having a ball



NICKY AND ALAN

I?m singing for love and I?m ready to fall



ALL

Either it?s real or it?s nothing at all



I sing cause I?m lonely

I sing cause I?m free

I won?t be the only one singing for me



Why am I the only one who?s singing for me?



Am I the only one singing for me?
