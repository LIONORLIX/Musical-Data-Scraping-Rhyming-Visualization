Walmartopia


ENSEMBLE:

We are one under Wal-Mart

Wal-Mart feeds us all

We were born to consume

From the cradle to the tomb

Never may you fall

Walmartopia

Walmartopia



One nation under Wal-Mart

Wal-Mart makes us breathe

And our minds are at rest

Father Wal-Mart knows what's best

How lucky we are to be in

Walmartopia

Walmartopia



MAN:

Medmart has the bills to pop

When the nightmares just won't stop



STUDENT:

Schoolmart teaches us to shop

How to stock and sweep and mop



MEN:

Newsmart tells us what is real

What to think and how to feel

Smash our enemies all apart

At National Security Mart



ENSEMBLE:

Ah!



(Different people sing the following phrases)



I am Wal-Mart

I am Wal-Mart

I am Wal-Mart

I am Wal-Mart

I am Wal-Mart

I am Wal-Mart

I am Wal-Mart

I am Wal-Mart





(Ensemble sings)



Walmartopia

Walmartopia

Walmartopia

Walmartopia
