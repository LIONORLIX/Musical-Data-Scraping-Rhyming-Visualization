Epilogue/I Love You, You're Perfect, Now Change


SPOKEN:



Woman: And the Lord God said,

this is how the book of man and women shall be written



Man: Endlessly crashing into eachother like two vengeful bumber cars-

Romeo, Romeo, where for art thou, Romeo?

You played it for her, you can play it for me.

My man done did me wrong.

Chicks and ducks and geese better scurry

I got it bad and bad aint good

You make me feel like a natural woman.

She was just 17 if you know what I mean

Love to Love ya baby!



Woman: But above all else said that Lord God- The Truth is Eternal



Man: All ye good people of Earth



Woman: Go Forth With Joy



Man 2: Find Someone to love



Woman 2: Someone you think is perfect



Man: And spend the rest of your life trying to change them



SUNG



All: Keep coming back

I keep coming back

I keep coming back to this whirlwind tour

Of loving, and leaving, and wanting more

I swear that I swore off of love before

Woman 1: But I,

Man 1: But I,

All: But I

Keep coming back

Somehow I keep coming back
