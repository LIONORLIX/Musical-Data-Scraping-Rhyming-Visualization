I Can Live With That


Spoken:

Arthur you seem like a nice man, you do but I don't really go out like your intending, I... I just don't



Sung:



Girl:

I’ve got some problems; my heath is just not good,



Guy:

Well at our age that's understood,



Girl:

I got arthitis,



Guy:

Flairs up in June,



Girl:

I've got bronchitis,



Guy:

I'll get that soon, no matter, I can live with that.



Girl:

I've had a bypass,



Guy:

Well I’ve had 2,



Girl:

I dye my hair,



Guy:

It looks nice blue.



Girl:

My ways are set,



Guy:

Well people change, I find you sexy



Girl:

I find you strange,



Guy:

No matter, I can live with that. I often think of those I miss.



Girl:

Friends keep dying but I grow strong,



Guy:

Sometimes I have to reminisce



Girl:

still does hurt just not as long. My kids don't visit,



Guy:

Mine never leave,



Girl:

I make a meatloaf you won't believe,



Guy:

I tell tall tales



Girl:

I tell the truth



Guy:

I drink skim milk



Girl:

I drink vermouth,



Guy:

No matter, I can live with that.



Girl:

I like things clean, I scrub the wash,



Guy:

I got a garden, I grow some squash



Girl:

I keep in shape, I mow the lawn,



Guy:

I sleep in late



Girl:

I'm up at dawn,



Guy:

No matter, I can live with that.



Girl:

Arthur, there is something I have to tell you, when it comes, to you know, I’m not the type of person who jumps in bed like

an acrobat, it takes time with

me,



Guy:

Uh oh.



Girl:

That’s a problem?



Guy:

Depends, how much time you talking, cause if you’re talking years I don't think either of us has that long.



Girl:

I was talking a few weeks maybe,



Guy:

No matter, I can live with that.



Girl:

I will be buried at my Jims right,



Guy:

Next to my sue is my grave site



Together:

But I’m still here, with much to give,



Guy:

Someday I'll die,



Girl:

For I’ll live, I’ll always love my Jim,



Guy:

And I my Sue



Girl:

I I just don't know,



Guy:

You think I do



Girl

No matter,



Together:

I can live with you.
