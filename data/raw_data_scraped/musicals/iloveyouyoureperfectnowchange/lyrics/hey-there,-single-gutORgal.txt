Hey There, Single Gut/Gal


Women 1 (spoken)

Go ahean Mory, make your toast.



Man 2 (spoken)

Right my toast, yes, a toast to our uh, not quite ready son Mitch,

and our too focused on her career or else she'd be our daugher, Karen.



Both

Here Here.

Hey there single gal, you're still single now.



Women 1

Tonight you'll still be sleeping all alone.



Both

But we don't pitty you, no no, not pretty you.

Cause your life belongs to no man its your own.



Man 2

You've got your friends so dear.



Women 1

Not to mention, your career.



Both

You don't need no guy to come knocking at your door. (oh oh oh)



Man 2

But we won't make a fuss.



Women 1

Cause you inspire us.



Both

Like Marlow Thomas and Mary Tyler Moore.

But hey there you're ok, women of today.



Man 2

You've got much more than mother ever had.



Women 1

You are so lucky.



Both

So go home get some sleep but pray you do not weep.



Women 1

Just curl up with some agendas, and be glad.



Both

Single Gal.

Hey there single guy, no need to clarify.



Women 1

Why a man of your age can't commit.



Both

It's fine with us my son, just drink dance have some fun.

We're your parents we support you. (spoken)

YOU LITTLE SHIT!



Man 2

Have you just lost your way?



Women 1

Repressed, confused, or gay?



Both

For once in your life give matramony, a whirl. (oh oh oh)



Women 1

So whatcha waiting you.



Man 2

So get on with mating you.



Both

What's wrong with her she seems like such a nice girl.

But we don't need to pry, relax you happy guy.

Adulthood's not a crucial as it seems.

For grandkids we can wait, no need to procreate.

Who care if you've destroyed your parents dreams,

Big career girl, wayward son, future spinster, dissapointment.

Here's to you.
