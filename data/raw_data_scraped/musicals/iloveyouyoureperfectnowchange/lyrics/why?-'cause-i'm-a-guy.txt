Why? 'Cause I'm a Guy


Man 1

All right, I am boasting

On Dates I am coasting

It's me I am toasting

Why? 'Cause I'm a Guy!



Man 2

My hairline's receding

My ulcer is bleeding

My ego needs feeding

Why?



Both

'Cause I'm a Guy



Man 1

My vacuum is rusting



Man 2

My bathtub is crusting



Both

My kitchen's disgusting

Why? 'Cause I'm a Guy!



Man 1

My gut is expanding



Man 2

In bed I'm commanding



Both

By God, I'm outstanding

Why? Why? Why? Why? Why?



Man 1

'Cause I am strong!



Man 2

Strong!



Both

I am invincible



Man 1

And I'm a hockey-loving



Man 2

Meat-eating



Man 1

Jock-itching



Man 2

Channel-flipping



Man 1

Belching, Burping



Man 2

Scratching, Snoring



Both

Never-stop-to-ask-directions

Guy! (Yelled) Yeah!
