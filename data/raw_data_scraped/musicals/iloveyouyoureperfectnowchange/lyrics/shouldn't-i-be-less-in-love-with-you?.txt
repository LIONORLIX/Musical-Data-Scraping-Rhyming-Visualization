Shouldn't I Be Less in Love With You?


Man: The experts say it does not last.

The experts say it's fleeting.

The experts bray love fades so fast

Then tell me why is my heart still beating?



Shouldn't I be less in love with you?

Shouldn't I address what time can do?

Shouldn't I be more inclined to flee?

Shouldn't I explore all I can be?



Shouldn't I confess a sorted fling?

Shouldn't I carress a cute young thing?

Shouldn't I asses what we've been through?

Shouldn't I be less in love with you?



After 30 years together

All those brutal fights

those futal fights

then the sleepless nights



Shouldn't I have quit 'cause marriage ends?

Shouldn't we have split like all our friends?

Shouldn't I profess it's time to go?

Shouldn't I be less in love with you?

No.
