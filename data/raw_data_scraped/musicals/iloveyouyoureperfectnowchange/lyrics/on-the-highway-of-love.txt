On the Highway of Love


Man:

In my home I?m not the boss

With my kids I?m at a loss

My life seems close, but no cigar

I've been jilted by my lucky star

Well thank god, at least I?ve got my car



Woman (speaking):

Okay everyone in.

Okay I?ll keep the mousse cake on my lap.

Ready when you are and no fighting



Man:

When I'm drivin?, I?m the king of my domain



Woman (speaking):

Be careful pulling out



Man:

when I'm drivin im a beast without a chain



Woman (speaking):

Slow, slow! We?re not in a hurry



Man:

When I?m drivin I?m a force you can?t restrain



Woman (speaking):

Put on your blinker, people aren?t mind readers



Man:

But on the highway of love she's drivin me insane



Woman:

Keep your eyes on the road



Man:

Keep your thoughts in your head



Woman:

keep your hands on the wheel



Man:

Shut your mouth or your dead



Woman:

I should've taken a cab



Man:

You should've taken a pill



Both:

When automobile-ing, we're not too appealing



Kids:

When their driving,

All they ever do is complain



Woman (speaking):

Watch. Watch.



Man (speaking):

La. La. La. I can?t hear you



Kids:

When their driving

it's a verbal hurricane



Woman (speaking):

Help me



Man (speaking):

Get in the car crazy lady



Kids:

When their driving we get a large migraine



Man (speaking):

You know so much, you take the wheel



Woman (speaking):

No!



Kids:

On the highway of love their driving us insane!



Man (speaking):

My wife, a mere passenger in my machine,

seems to think it?s her job to share her relentless opinions with the pilot.

But remember all of those James Bond movies;

the ones with all those cool cars with those ejector seats,

all I?m saying is General Motors could make a fortune.

I thank you very much



Woman (speaking):

Ya know, my husband has a heavy foot, which goes along with a heavy head.

You think he would view driving as a simple means of getting from somewhere to

somewhere else.  Instead, he must view it as a right of manhood, a test of testosterone.

If you ask me, it?s no coincidence that the stick shift is shaped like

the male sex organ.  I thank you.



Woman:

At home we don?t fight



Man:

At home we don?t yell



Both:

By once we start the car, the marriage goes to hell



Kids (speaking):

Daddy, are we there yet

I?ve gotta pee



Woman (speaking):

You?re gonna hit something



Dad (speaking):

Will you all shut up?



All:

Were losing our grip on this family trip

When were driving our fights are high octane



Woman (speaking):

This man is trying to kill me (woman)



All:

When were driving were obnoxious and profane



Man (speaking):

God-dammit! Don?t make me stop this car.



All:

When were driving were in a lot of pain



Man (speaking):

We?re blowing up dysfunctional (man)



All:

On the highway of love



Both:

We scream till were horse



All:

On the highway of love



Kids:

They outta get a divorce



All:

On the highway of love



Woman (speaking):

Okay, that wasn?t so bad

Okay, you park the car

I?ll take the mousse cake

No ah Emma, make sure you kiss all your relatives

And don?t tell anyone they?re getting fat



Man (speaking):

Hey, made good time



Man:

Forever shall I reign,

Whoa, yea!



Man (speaking):

Love ya babe!
