As the Chairman of the Committee / How Beautiful / Never Was There a Girl So Fair / Some Girls Can Bake a Pie


FULTON:

As the chairman of the committee

I announce we've made our choice;

Ev'ry lover from Dubuque to Jersey City

Should rejoice!



COMMITTEE:

We rejoice!



JUDGES AND COMMITTEE:

When the angels up there designed her,

They designed a thoroughbred;

And on March the fourth the President will find her

Worthy of his board and bed.



FULTON:

And now it thrills me to introduce the rarest of American beauties,

the future first lady of the land -- a fit consort for the ruler of "122 million freeborn"

- ladies and gentlemen -- Miss Diana Devereaux!



HOW BEAUTIFUL

[DIANA APPEARS WITH FOUR OTHER PRIZE WINNERS

HOLDING TRAIN ATTACHED TO HER BATHING SUIT]



ALL:

[SING]

How beautiful, beautiful, beautiful!

How utterly, utterly so!

The charming, the gracious, the dutiful

Diana Devereaux!



FULTON:

[SPOKEN]

The committee will now tell why she was chosen -- with music!



NEVER WAS THERE A GIRL SO FAIR



COMMITTEE:

Never was there a girl so fair!

Never was there a form so rare!



DIANA:

[SPOKEN]

Ah could throw mah arms right around your neck!



COMMITTEE:

A voice so lyrical

Is given few;

Her eyes a miracle

Of Prussian blue;

Ruby lips and a foot so small;

As for hips -- she has none at all!



GILHOOLEY:

Did you ever see such footsies,

Or a more enticing limb?



LIPPMAN:

And the ankles or her tootsies

Are so slim!



LYONS AND JUDGES:

What a charming epiglottis!

What a lovely coat of tan!

Oh, the man who is not hot is

Not a man!



COMMITTEE:

She's a bargain to whom she's wed'

More than worthy his board and bed!



FULTON:

Says the chairman of the committee,

Let the newsmen now come in.

[TO DIANA]

For the sound reels you must look your best, my pretty!

[TO GUARDS]

Have the interviews begin!



GILHOOLEY AND LYONS:

We shall go and bring them in!



WINTERGREEN:

[RUSHING CENTER]

Stop! No!

Though this may be a blow,

I simply cannot marry

Diana Devereaux!



COMMITTEE:

What's this? What's this?

He says he cannot marry

Diana Devereaux?



COMMITTEE AND JUDGES:

[TO WINTERGREEN]

You mean you will not many

Diana Devereaux!



WINTERGREEN:

Please understand!

It isn't that I would jilt or spurn 'er!

It's just that I love someone else!



ALL:

Who?



WINTERGREEN:

Whom!

[TURNS TO MARY]

Mary Turner!



COMMITTEE:

The man is mad!

Or else a cad!

He'll have to take her --

He can't forsake her



DIANA:

This jilting me,

It cannot be!

This lousy action

Calls for retraction!



COMMITTEE AND JUDGES:

We must know why

You should prefer

Instead of Di

[POINTING TO DIANA]

A girl like her.

[POINTING TO MARY]



GIRLS:

Yes, tell us why

You should prefer

Instead of Di

A girl like her!



WINTERGREEN:

All that I can say of Mary Turner

Is that I love Mary Turner.



COMMITTEE AND JUDGES:

What's to be done?

Though she has won,

[INDICATING DIANA]

Though she has signed up

He's made his mind up!

His love he'd ruther

Give to the other!

[INDICATING DIANA]

What shall we do now?

What is our cue now?



DIANA:

[TO COMMITTEE]

He will do nothing of the sort.

First we'll settle this thing in court.

[TO WINTERGREEN]

You seem to think Miss Turner hits the spot;

But what has she got that I haven't got?



ALL:

Yes, what has "she" got

[POINTING TO MARY]

that she hasn't got?

[POINTING TO DIANA]



WINTERGREEN:

My Mary makes corn muffins -

[TO DIANA]

Can you make corn muffins?



DIANA:

I cain't make corn muffins



ALL:

[SORROWFULLY]

She can't make corn muffins!



SOME GIRLS CAN BAKE A PIE



WINTERGREEN:

Well, there you are!



Some girls can bake a pie

Made up of prunes and quinces;

Some make an oyster fry -

Others are good at blintzes.

Some lovely girls have done

Wonders with turkey stuffin's,

But I have found the one

Who can really make corn muffins!



DIANA:

Who cares about corn muffins?

All I demand is justice!



[WINTERGREEN REPEATS "SOME GIRLS CAN..." MARY JOINS IN,

AS COMMITTEE AND ENSEMBLE, SOLD ON THE IDEA, SING OBBLIGATO]



COMMITTEE AND ENSEMBLE:

Corn muffins -

Though other girls are good at turkey stuffin's

She takes the cake -

For she can bake

Corn muffins;

Corn muffins -

He's not to blame for falling if she's able

To serve them at his table.

[COMMITTEE STARTS TO SAMPLE MUFFINS]

They should be happy night and day;

They'll make a couple so delightful;

When two agree on corn muffins,

Their marriage is only rightful!



DIANA AND GIRLS:

[SIMULTANEOUSLY, TO THE COMMITTEE]

Don't surrender!

Don't be tender!

I'm (she's) the winner!

She is a little sinner!

Come! Make your mind up.

I, (she) not she

Is the one who's really signed up!



COMMITTEE:

[HOLDING UP MUFFINS]

Great! Great!

It really must be fate!



COMMITTEE AND JUDGES:

We must declare these muffins

The best we ever ate!



GIRLS:

[SIMULTANEOUSLY]

There's none but Mary Turner

Could ever be his mate!

[DIANA EXITS]



[HALF THE VOICES KEEP REPEATING]

There's none but Mary Turner

Could ever be his mate!



[THE OTHER HALF SING]

She can make corn muffins!

She can make corn muffins!



ALL:

[Tableau]

Let's all rejoice!
