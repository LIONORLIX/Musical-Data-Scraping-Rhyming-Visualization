Garc,on, S'il Vous Plai't / Illegitimate Daughter / We'll Impeach Him Who Cares? (Reprise)


GAR?ON, S'IL VOUS PLA?T

[MARTIAL OUTBURST. SIX FRENCH SOLDIERS MARCH ON]



FRENCH SOLDIERS:

Gar?on, s'il vous pla?t,

Encore Chevrolet coup?;

Papah, pooh, pooh, pooh!

Gar?on, qu'est-ce que c'est?

Tra la, Maurice Chevalier!

J'adore cr?pes Suzette

Et aussi Lafayette!

[THEY MARCH, REPEAT THIS, COME TO ATTENTION]

And now we give the meaning of this song:

We're six of the fifty million and we can't be wrong!

We're six of the fifty million and we can't be wrong!



ENTRANCE OF FRENCH AMBASSADOR



FRENCH AMBASSADOR:

I am the Ambassador of France,

And I've come here to see

A grievous wrong righted.

My country is deeply hurt.

Not since the days of Louis the Seventh,

The Eighth, the Ninth, the Tenth,

And possibly the Eleventh,

Has such a thing happened.



ENSEMBLE

What's troubling you?



FRENCH AMBASSADOR:

You have done a great injustice

To a French descendent-

A lovely girl

Whose rights have been trampled in the dust.



ENSEMBLE:

Who is she? What's her name?



FRENCH AMBASSADOR:

Her name is Diana Devereaux.



ENSEMBLE:

Diana Devereaux! Diana Devereaux!

Since when is she of French descent?



FRENCH AMBASSADOR:

I've been looking up her family tree

And I have found a most important pedigree!



THE ILLEGITIMATE DAUGHTER



FRENCH AMBASSADOR:

She's the illegitimate daughter

Of an illegitimate son

Of an illegitimate nephew

Of Napol?on.



ENSEMBLE:

Napol?on?



FRENCH AMBASSADOR:

She offers aristocracy

To this bizarre democracy,

Where naught is sacred but the old simoleon!

I must know why

You crucify

My native country

With this effront'ry

To the illegitimate daughter

Of an illegitimate son

Of an illegitimate nephew

Of Napol?on.



ENSEMBLE:

To the illegitimate daughter

Of an illegitimate son

Of an illegitimate nephew

Of Napol?on.



[ENSEMBLE TURNS ON WINTERGREEN]

ENSEMBLE:

You so-and-so!

We didn't know

She had a tie-up

So very high up!

She's the illegitimate daughter

Of an illegitimate son

Of an illegitimate nephew

Of Napol?on.



DIANA:

Ah!

I was the most beautiful blossom

In all the Southland.



MARY AND WINTERGREEN:

We know all that.



FRENCH AMBASSADOR:

You know all that,

But you don't know the misery

Of this poor little girl who has suffered.

Because...



ENSEMBLE:

Because...



MARY AND WINTERGREEN:

Because?



FRENCH AMBASSADOR:

Because...



BECAUSE, BECAUSE (REPRISE)



DIANA:

Because, because, because, because,

I won the competition

But I got no recognition

And because he broke my heart!



Because, because, because, because,

The man who ought to love me

Tried to make a money of me,

Double-crossing from the start!

I might have been First Lady,

But now my past is shady.

Oh, pity this poor maidie!



FRENCH AMBASSADOR:

And there's the man who ought to pay!



ENSEMBLE:

Because, because, because, because,

She won the prize for beauty,

But she didn't do his duty;

He has broken my heart!



FRENCH AMBASSADOR:

[TO WINTERGREEN]

You see this poor girl has suffered.

And so, on behalf of France,

I demand that your marriage be annulled

And that you marry Diana.



WINTERGREEN:

Never, never!



FRENCH AMBASSADOR:

Then you will arouse the anger of France,

And you must be prepared to face the consequences!



[SOLDIERS LINE UP WITH AMBASSADOR AND DIANA.

THEY MARCH OFF, SINGING]



FRENCH SOLDIERS:

Gar?on, s'il vous pla?t,

Encore Chevrolet coup?;

Papah, pooh, pooh, pooh!

? vous tout dir vay ? vous?



FULTON:

Jack, you've got to do something about this.



WINTERGREEN:

Leave Mary? Never!



FULTON:

We are all in this together;

We are birdies of a feather.

And if you don't change your thesis

Then our party goes to pieces!



LYONS:

All our jobs you'll be destroying

With your attitude annoying.



GILHOOLEY:

You will get us all in trouble!

And in spades, sir, which is double!



WINTERGREEN:

I will never leave Mary!



LYONS:

Since he's acting so contrary,

Send him off on a vacation.



GILHOOLEY:

I suggest resignation.



WINTERGREEN:

Resignation?



ENSEMBLE:

Resignation?



FULTON:

You've got to face it - This is a crisis!

To leave your Mary you may decline;

But to save us, my good advice is:

You resign!



ENSEMBLE:

Yes, you resign!



WINTERGREEN:

I assure you - though it's a crisis!

To leave your Mary I may decline;

And I don't care what your advice is;

I decline to resign!



MARY:

We decline to resign!



WE'LL IMPEACH HIM



[TO EACH OTHER]



LYONS AND GILHOOLEY:

He is stubborn - we must teach him;

I'm afraid we must impeach him!



ENSEMBLE:

He is stubborn - we must teach him;

He has forced us to impeach him!



COMMITTEE:

You decline to resign.

So we'll teach you!

We'll impeach you!



SECRETARIES:

You decline to resign-

We don't envy you at all!



COMMITTEE:

You decline to resign.

So we'll teach you!

We'll impeach you!

You decline to resign-

Humpty Dumpty has to fall!



[THEY EXIT]



WHO CARES? (REPRISE)





MARY:

Who cares

If the sky cares to fall in the sea?



WINTERGREEN:

We two together can win out*

Just remember to stick you chin out.



[*EARLIER VERSION OF THIS AND NEXT LINE:

Who cares if Congress is crummy?

They can never take my love from me!]



MARY:

Why should I care?

Life is one long jubilee-



BOTH:

So long as I care for you-

And You care for me!
