Some Girls Can Bake a Pie (Reprise)


WINTERGREEN:

Some girls can bake a pie

Made up of prunes and quinces;

Some make an oyster fry -

Others are good at blintzes.

Some lovely girls have done

Wonders with turkey stuffin's,

But I have found the one

Who can really make corn muffins!



ENSEMBLE:

Yes, he has found the one

Who can really make corn muffins!



DIANA:

Who cares about corn muffins?

All I demand is justice!



WINTERGREEN:

Which is more important?

Corn muffins or justice?



ENSEMBLE:

Which is more important?

Corn muffins or justice?



JUDGES:

If you will wait a minute,

You'll have our decision.



[JUDGES GO INTO HUDDLE]

The decision of the Supreme Court is-

Corn muffins!



ENSEMBLE:

Great! Great!

It's written on the slate!*

There's none but Mary Turner

Could ever be his mate!
