Love Is Sweeping the Country


JENKINS AND MISS BENSON:

Why are people gay

All the night and day,

Feeling as they never felt before?

What is the thing

That makes them sing?



Rich man, poor man, thief,

Doctor lawyer, chief,

Feel a feeling that they can't ignore!

It plays a part

In ev'ry heart,

And ev'ry hearts is shouting "Encore!"



Love is sweeping the country!

Waves are hugging the shore;

All the sexes

From Maine to Texas

Have never known such love before.



See them billing and cooing

Like the birdies above!

Each girl and boy alike,*

Sharing joy alike,



Feels that passion'll

Soon be national.

Love is sweeping the country!

There never was so much love!



Love is sweeping the country!

Waves are hugging the shore;

All the sexes

From Maine to Texas

Have never known such love before.



See them billing and cooing

Like the birdies above!

Each girl and boy alike,

Sharing joy alike,



Feels that passion'll

Soon be national.

Love is sweeping the country!

There never was so much love!



Spring is in the air-

Each mortal loves his neighbor.

Who's that loving pair?

That's Capital and Labors.



Chevrolet and Ford

Have felt this cosmic urging;

They with one accord,

Have kissed and now are merging.



Florida and Cal-

lifornia get together

In a "festival"

Of oranges and weather.



Boston's upper zones

Are changing all their habits,

And I hear the Cohns

Are taking up the Cabots.



Taximen take dimes

And never curse the traffic,

While the "New York Times"

Adores the "New York Graphic."



Love is sweeping the country!

Waves are hugging the shore;

All the sexes

From Maine to Texas

Have never known such love before.



See them billing and cooing

Like the birdies above!

Each girl and boy alike,

Sharing joy alike,



Feels that passion'll

Soon be national.

Love is sweeping the country!

There never was so much love!



[*ALTERNATE CONSIDERED FOR LINES 19-22]

It's overpowering;

Hearts are flowering,

Sure that passion'll

Soon be national.



PATTER [REVISED VERSION]

Spring is in the air-

Each mortal loves his neighbor.

Who's that loving pair?

That's Capital and Labors.



Florida and Cal-

lifornia get together

In a "festival"

Of oranges and weather.



Boston's upper zones

Are changing social habits,

And I hear the Cohns

Are taking up the Cabots.



Cities are above

The quarrels that were hapless.

Look who's making love:

St.Paul and Minneap'lis!
