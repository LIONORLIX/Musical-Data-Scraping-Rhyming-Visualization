Oh, What A Man!


Na Na Na Na.Na Na Na Na (repeat)



Man and Woman:

Don’t you just love a pretty love story?

Brimming with passion, valor and glory

Well that’s too bad, that aint our tale today

What we’ve got here is more realistic

A husband, a wife, and things get sadistic

And we are here, to do the play by play



There is a man, and we’ll call him Tom. Tom

Because that’s his name as was given by mom

Life was so swell, til things went to’ well

Meet our home owning, lawn mowing, man?.



Tom:

Jump out of bed and start my preparing

The clock strikes six, I’m ready and raring

Suit myself up, it’s time to seize the day (Good morning’,morning)



Lucy:

Normally here it sounds like a riot

The kids are at camp, I’m loving the quiet

I think today is going to go my way



Gotta go honey

But Tom, today is .. (what, what? Today is what?

Never mind go.. go!   I love you)



Oh he’s a man, who works night and day

He’s got a porche and a 401K

Isn’t he great, successful and straight?

He’s a porche driving, wife loving,  home owning, lawn mowing man



Greetings good workers of your



No time to talk, the copy’s not gelling

The story board sucks, the staff is rebelling

They’re pissed off

People, relax, I’m going to save the day



Before we start, I need to speak with Jessica. It’s important



Today is your 15th wedding anniversary



Oh what a man, A wonderful man

Swinging through life with the ease of Tarzan

Take it from me, there’s one way to be

Be a bread-winning, ass kicking, porche driving, wife loving.

Home owining, lawn mowing man



Tom, what are you doing home?

Happy Anniversary? Na na na



A hickey Tom .. how could this be true

How dare she be as unfaithful as you?

For I’m a man, a wonderful man

Life was so great til this shit hit the fan

How could she stray?  Well let’s start the play

Marriage could turn into what you never planned

Pick yourself up, dammit Tom, take a stand

Oh you bread-winning, ass kicking, wife loving, skirt chasing,

(we need a therapist) home owning, lawn mowing man

Don’t you just love a pretty long story.    I’m a man?..!
