Because


Lucy:

Tom, I’ll always love you. After all we made a vow

You never took it seriously, but I did, well until now

Tom, I’ve been unfaithful. Though I thought I never would

Now do I feel sad’ Yes, but just a tad

I’ve been bad, and perhaps that’s good



Because you rarely listen.. Because you never try

Because the man I married, was a hell of a nicer guy

Because our life grew boring, because I’m full of fears

Because he’s done some things to me that you haven’t done in years

Because I’m growing older, because my looks won’t last

Because happy ever after, is a fairy tale of the past

Because he’s quite a lover, because you quite, are not

Because you swore fidelity, then immediately forgot

Now you may double standard me, saying it’s not the same somehow

But all the times you filandered me

I thought it was my fault, ‘til now



And now I’ll wear these frills, I’ll wear this skirt

Though it’s a little tight, I’ll wear these shoes, the ones that hurt

You see I ain’t Snow White

I’ll wear the dress that’s a little small, I’ll wear the heels that are way too tall

Tom, take a look, I took it all



Because I’m only human, because I’m in my prime

Because you’re out two timing me, for maybe the 15th time

Because you have no conscience, because he makes me drool

Because no longer will I play the role, the suffering wife, the fool

Because he thinks I’m special, because you think we’re through



But most of all, I want him so much, because, because, because

Because he’s not you
