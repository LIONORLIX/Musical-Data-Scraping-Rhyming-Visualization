The Greatest Friend


Sebastian:

His name was Alex.  He was my roommate

We had this funky bachelor pad, we picked up women, we were bad

We drove cross country, in his shit-ass Chevy

That thing broke down, around south bend

He was the greatest friend



Tom:

His name was Franklin, my drinking buddy

Some nights we passed out on the floor, then we’d wake up and drink some more

We got arrested, for jogging naked

I thought the fun would never end

He was the greatest friend



Both

Oh we swore we would always live close by

No matter our lives, our wives or our careers

Oh we formed a bond that would never die

I haven’t heard from him in years



Tom:

So life gets funny, and time to end things

This bond I thought would always last, it’s now a footnote in my past



Both

His name was Alex, His name was Franklin

As you grow old, you can’t pretend

It’s hard to make, a friend
