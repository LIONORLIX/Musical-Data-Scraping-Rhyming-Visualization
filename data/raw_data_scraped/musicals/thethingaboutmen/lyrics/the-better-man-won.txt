The Better Man Won


Tom:

Raise a glass, let’s toast a good fight

All things pass, and some turn out right

15 years, it was quite a run

Screw the tears, the better man won



What i did, i did from the heart

But, why kid, i wasn’t too smart

Close the book, the tale has been spawn

Take a look, the better man won



I hope he loves you madly, treats you kindly, takes good care

I hope he pays attention, may he be your every prayer



I hope your days are happy, and you sometimes think of me

I hope he’s everything that i could never be



That’s the game, my friend took the prize

I became a little more wise

Early frost, my summer is done

One man lost, one man lost, the better man won

The better man won
