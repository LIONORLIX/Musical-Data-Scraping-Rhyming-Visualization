Downtown Bohemian Slum


Seb: Hey, I got a surprise for you .

Tom: No, no, I don’t like surprises.

Seb: Lucy’s coming here



Seb: She will love you

Tom: I somehow doubt that

Seb: Why so gloomy’  Listen roomy, just hold steady and get ready.

I have a hunch .. she’s coming for brunch.  I should

have bought more furniture, Does she know what’s in store

The kitchen’s a disaster. There’s mildew on the floor,

Ok, it’s rundown, at least it’s mine.  It’s all that I’ve become

So welcome my dear Lucy, to my downtown, Bohemian Slum



Now some would say, a man my age, shouldn’t be this poor

An artist who is starving, should be like 24

But there are no rats, just a mouse

I watched him steal a crumb

I find there is joy here Lucy, in my downtown, 4 flights, Bohemian Slum



Lucy:

I parked my car, I hope it’s safe.  I bravely made it here.

His doorway reeks of urine.  His neighbors smell like beer

Now take a deep breath, just stay calm, and smile at that nice bum

I’m pride I finally made it, to his downtown, 4 flight, walk up Bohemian Slum



Tom:

Ok I’m trapped, I’ll tell the truth.  I’ll just say, Lucy dear

I moved in with your lover, and he thinks that I’m queer

We’ll have a laugh, no we won’t

No wonder I feel numb.  My life will soon be over

In this downtown, 4 flights, walk up, fuck me, Bohemian Slum



Seb:

Now she’ll come and look about; I just hope she’ll believe

That squalor can be charming; and dirt has ‘joix de vive’

I should have swept up, cleaned the sink

Washed off all the scum.  Oh god, please like it Lucy

It’s my Downtown. 4 flight, walk-up Bohemian Slum

It’s my Downtown. 4 flight, walk-up fuck me Bohemian Slum

Come on up Lucy!
