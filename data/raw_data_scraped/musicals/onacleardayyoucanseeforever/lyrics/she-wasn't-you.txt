She Wasn't You


EDWARD:

Why did each love melt away before?

Heaven above turn to clay before?

She wasn't you - She wasn't you.



Why did champagne lose its year for me?

Love's haunting strain disappear for me?

What could I do?

She wasn't you.



She wasn't you, and no vows ever chained me.

No, she wasn't you, and goodbyes never pained me.

Now I know why each affair always faded so fast!

Only with you was I born to live;

Only to you is the love I give,

Love for as long as a lifetime can last.



She wasn't you, and no vows ever chained me.

No, she wasn't you, and goodbyes never pained me.

Now I know why each affair always faded so fast!

Only with you was I born to live;

Only to you is the love I give,

Love for as long as a lifetime can last.
