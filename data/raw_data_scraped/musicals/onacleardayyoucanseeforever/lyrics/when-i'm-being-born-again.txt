When I'm Being Born Again


THEMISTOCLES KRIAKOS:

[Spoken]

This will be my heaven

When I'm being born again!



[Sung]

Who is that boy

Beaming out loud?

So many nurses

That it looks like a crowd.

Who could it be?

That boy is me!

When I'm being born again.



Look at that room

Filled up with toys;

Must be the property of two-hundred boys.

Don't cross the line!

Those toys are mine!

When I'm being born again.



When I will be being on earth again

I will be the gladdest of little men.

My, what a heart!

My, what a soul!

He's putting back

The box of candy I stole.



And there's a lot of pride there.

That's because it's me inside there,

Feeling happy when

I am born again.

This will be my heaven

When I'm being born again!



[Interlude]

When I will be being on earth again

I will be the gladdest of little men.

My, what a heart!

My, what a soul!

He's putting back

The box of candy I stole.



And there's a lot of pride there.

That's because it's me inside there,

Feeling happy when

I am born again.

This will be my heaven

When I'm being born again!
