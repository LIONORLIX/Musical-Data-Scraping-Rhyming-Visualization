Overture


CHORUS

On a clear day

Rise and look around you

And you'll see who you are

On a clear day

How it will astound you

That the glow of your being

Outshines every star

You'll feel part of every mountain, sea and shore

You can hear

From far and near

A word you've never, never heard before...

And on a clear day...On a clear day...

You can see forever...

And ever...

And ever...

And ever more...
