What Did I Have That I Don't Have?


DAISY:

I don't know why they redesigned me.

He likes the way he used to find me.

He likes the girl I left behind me

I mean he...I mean me...



What did I have that I don't have?

What did he like that I lost track of?

What did I do that I don't do the way I did before?



What isn't there that once was there?

What have I got a great big lack of?

Something in me that

He could see that

Beckons to him no more.



I'm just a victim of time,

Obsolete in my prime,

Out-of-date and outclassed, by my past!

What did he love that there's none of?

What did I lose the sweet warm knack of?

Wouldn't I be the late great me if I knew how?

Oh, what did I have I don't have now?



[Interlude]



Where can I go to repair

All the wear and the tear

Till I'm once again the previous me?

What did he like that I'm not like?

What was the charm that I've run dry of?

What would I give if my old know-how still knew how?

Oh, what did I have I don't have now?
