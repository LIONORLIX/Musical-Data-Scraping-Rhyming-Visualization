You Made Me Love You


I didn't want to do it

I didn't want to do it

You made me want you

And all the time you knew it

I guess you always knew it

You made me happy sometimes

You made me glad

But there were times, dear

You made me feel so bad

You made me sigh for

I didn't wanna tell you

I didn't want to tell you

I want some lovin', that's true

Yes I do, indeed I do, you know I do

Give me, give me, give me what I cry for

You know ya got the brand o' kisses that I'd die for

You know YMMLY

(VERSE here!)

You made me sigh for

I didn't want to tell you

I didn't wanna tell you

I want some lovin', that's true

Yes I do, indeed I do, you know I do

Give me, give me, give me what I cry for

You know ya got the brand o' kisses that I'd die for

You know YMMLY
