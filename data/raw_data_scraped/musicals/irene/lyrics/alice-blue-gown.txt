Alice Blue Gown


I once had a gown, it was almost new

Oh, the daintiest thing, it was sweet Alice blue

With little forget-me-nots placed here and there

When I had it on, I walked on the air

And it wore, and it wore, and it wore

'Til it went, and it wasn't no more



In my sweet little Alice blue gown

When I first wandered down into town

I was both proud and shy, as I felt every eye

And in every shop window I primped passing by

Then in manner of fashion, I'd frown

And the world seemed to smile all around

'Til it wilted, I wore it, I'll always adore it

My sweet little Alice blue gown



The little silk worms that made silk for that gown

Just made that much silk and then crawled in the ground

For there never was anything like it before

And I don't dare to hope there will be any more

But it's gone, 'cause it just had to be

Still it wears in my memory



In my sweet little Alice blue gown

When I first wandered down into town

I was both proud and so shy, as I felt every eye

And in every shop window I primped passing by

Then in manner of fashion, I'd frown

And the world seemed to smile all around

So it wouldn't be proper if made of silk were another

My sweet little Alice blue gown
