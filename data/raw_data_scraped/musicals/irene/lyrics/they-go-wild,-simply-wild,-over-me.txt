They Go Wild, Simply Wild, Over Me


To the ladies I was nothing but another pretty face.

I never made first base, with just my pretty face

Until I took a needle and began to make a dress

Eureka! I discovered the secret of success!



They go wild, simply wild over me

I can boast I'm the toast of gay Paree!

The ladies seem to find that a service such as mine

I take them, remake them. It's all too too divine.



Anything I will do for a fee

-----------------------------

Each time a bodice I adjust, adding inches to the bust,

They go wild, simply over me.



Although I do not doubt myself, my horn I hate to toot

And though I should be mute, it's obvious I'm a beaut

It's strange how they adore me so,

the French would call it 'fou'!

But what I did for them girls,

I'm here to do for you!



All the girls that you see in Paree

look their best when they're dressed by little me

I fit each frock and frill

and to add an extra thrill

I tease them, I squeeze them.,

It all goes on the bill!



In the US of A, I should be

It's a grand land of opportunity

for when the women buy my clothes

And their men pay through the nose

They go wild simply wild over me!
