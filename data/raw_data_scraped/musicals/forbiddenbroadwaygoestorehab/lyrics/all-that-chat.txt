All That Chat


ANNOUNCER (spoken):

And now, ladies and gentlemen, please welcome back, one of Chicago's deadliest

Velma's... Miss Bibi Neuwirth



BIBI (spoken):

Hello, suckers. Did you pay good money to see a Broadway show, when you could have just

stayed home and read whats online?



(sung)



Come on babe, get on the internet

And all that chat

I hear that devil lounge

Is even meaner yet

Than all that chat

Frank Langella's hoggin' Whoopi's spot

But as Sir Thomas Moore, she says he's not so hot

Check out the rumor mill

And gossip made to kill

On all that chat



MAN:

Oh, what happens offstage is more fun than on



BIBI:

On all that chat



MAN:

Send!



WOMAN:

Oh, I hear that Broadway is a Babylon



BIBI:

On all that chat



WOMAN:

Send!



MAN:

Raul Esparza slept with Chita



WOMAN:

Chita finally slept with Rita



BOTH:

And I hear

Tom Wolpat's queer

For all that chat



BIBI:

I just read

That Brigadoon is dead



MAN & WOMAN:

Oh, what happens offstage is more fun than on



BIBI:

On all that chat

The workshop didn't work

And so the bad news spread



MAN & WOMAN:

Oh, I've heard that Broadway is a Babylon



BIBI:

On all that chat

Hold on, hon

I'm hookin' up to links

Where there's an Equus clip

Where Daniel Radcliffe stinks

And there's a running blog

That's strictly dog-eat-dog

On all that chat



MAN (spoken):

So Checkie, that's final, huh? You prefer Andrew Lippa's Wild Party over Michael John

Lecusa's? Send.



WOMAN (spoken):

Yeah, I'm afraid so Bruce Menblatt. I hate Michael John Lecusa. Send.



MAN (spoken):

Oh Checkie? Send.



WOMAN (spoken):

Yeah? Send.



MAN (spoken):

Nobody trashes Michael John Lecusa's Wild Party on my Facebook! Send control alt delete!



(Explosion)



WOMAN:

Ah!



BIBI:

Who needs theater tix

When you can get your kicks

On all that chat!
