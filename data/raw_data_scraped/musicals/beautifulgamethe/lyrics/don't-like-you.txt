Don't Like You


Mary

Don't like you. Don't like you. I don't think i like you.

You're bad. You're sad. And i know nicer boys.



John

Not bothered. Not bothered. I simply am not bothered.

You're vain. A total pain. And i know sweeter girls.



You've been hanging round my door

And watching me at school.



Mary

Yes and i was thinking you're completely uncool.



John

Well i wouldn't say yourself was much to shout about.



Mary

Do your fly up sonny 'cos your brain's hanging out.

John

Well what the hell at least there's

One thing that we agree.



Bothi'm damned sure i don't like you.



John

Don't hate you. Could stand you.

If pushed could tolerate you.



Mary

I'm sure, that you'll mature.

I have known more stupid boys.



Mary

You say it.



John

No you say it.

Mary

Alright. I vaguely like you. It's bad, i must be mad.

But i think we could be friends.



John

No commitment, only friends.



Mary

I like you.



John

Both

Yes, i think i like you. It's real. It's how i feel.

And i want to be your ...
