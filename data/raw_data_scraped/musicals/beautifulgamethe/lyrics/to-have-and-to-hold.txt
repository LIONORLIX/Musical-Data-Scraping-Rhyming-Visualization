To Have And To Hold


John

To have and to hold. Faithfully.

To honour and love. Devotedly.

Wilt thou take this man?



Mary

Yes i will.

For better or worse. Constantly.

In sickness and health. Unfailingly.

Wilt thou take this girl?



John

Yes i will.



Both

I pledge my soul to you. I give you my heart.

There by your side until death do us part.



Chorus

To honour and love. Constantly.

'Til death do them part. Devotedly.

Yes from this wedding day forth

Joined by god.



Both

To be by your side. Faithfully.

Forsaking all others. Willingly.

With my body i thee worship.

And with this ring i thee wed.

To have and to hold. Fervently.

To honour and love. Unendingly.

Wilt thou take this man/girl?

Yes i will.



John

And wilt thou take this man

For better and for worse?



Mary

And wilt thou take this girl

In sickness and in health?



Both

And wilt thou take this heart?



Congregation

God we hope they've made the right decision.

Will their fate be forty years of strife?

Is this union headed for division?

No! It's the happiest day of their life!
