I'd Rather Die On My Feet Than Live On My Knees


Thomas

I'd rather die on my feet than live on my knees,

Death with honour

Because the weak and the fearful are a social disease.

I am stronger!

Insects crawl, a man stands tall, he has to risk it all.

Men dictate their final fate while fools negotiate.

When the battle is over and the last deal is done,

Let me tell you.

The man with the power will be the man with the gun.

He can kill you.

You're naive if you believe they'll give you a reprieve.

Close your eyes to compromise, betrayal in disguise.

I'd rather die on my feet than live on my knees.

Won't surrender!

Because i am my country and my country is me.

I'll defend her!
