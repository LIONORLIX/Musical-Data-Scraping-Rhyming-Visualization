Don't Like You (Reprise)


Ginger

I was wondering if there's

Any chance that you'd be my bird?

Or if you want, i'll bugger off, just give me the word.



Bernadette

Not at all, i'd really like to see you again.

If you think it wouldn't be too much of a pain.



Ginger

Bloody hell, it's taken me a year to ask this.



Bernadette

If that's the case, why don't we

Celebrate with a kiss?



Both

'Cos i'm quite sure that i like you.



Ginger

I like you.



Bernadette

I like you.



Both

Oh dear, i think i love you.

It's strange but things have changed.

'Cos now i've found my boy/girl.
