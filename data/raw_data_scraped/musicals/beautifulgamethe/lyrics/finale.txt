Mary

People need love,

That's what we live for.

Now is the time it's

Not too late.



We have to love,

Try to forgive more.

No child was ever born

To hate.



No child was ever born

To hate.



I will strive for peace with all my might.

That's what's right.



All kinds of love

Bring us together.

Causes the broken

Hearts to mend.



People must love,

Now and forever.

There's only one love in the end.



Full company

There's only one love in the end.
