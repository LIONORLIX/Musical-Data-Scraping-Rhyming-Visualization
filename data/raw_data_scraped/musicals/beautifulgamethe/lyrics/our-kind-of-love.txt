Our Kind Of Love


Christine

Our kind of love.

Our kind of passion.

Burns with a heat so

Hard to bear.



It's not a game.

No fad or fashion.

Our kind of love's for

Those who dare.



I must be strong.

I must be bolder.

Cling to my dream and

Never tire.



Each love denied

Leaves people colder.

New love rekindles

Every fire.

I shan't betray my

Heart's desire.



Even though we come from different sides,

We won't hide.



I am in love.

No one can blame me.

Such is my story,

And my fate.



My kind of love

Will never shame me.

My love is stronger

Than their hate.

My love is stronger

Than their hate.



I shall cling to him with all my might,

It's my right.



All kinds of love

Bring us together.

Causes the broken

Hearts to mend.



People must love,

Now and forever.

There's only one love in the end.

There's only one love in the end.
