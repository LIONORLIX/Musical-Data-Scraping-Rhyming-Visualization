Let Us Love In Peace


Christine

Dream about a day when we'll be

Calm, serene, completely carefree.

Just for fun. Think of one. Ordinary day.



Ask yourself what it would feel like.

Dream the dream with all of your might.

Close your eyes. Visualise. Just one normal day.



Both

Time to find out who we are.

Time to find our lucky star.

Time for all our pain to cease.

We'll love in peace.



Del

Just imagine no more violence.

No more bombs. The sound of silence.

Time to be. You and me. Time to love in peace.



Both

Days of hope so calm and tranquil.

Private moments to be thankful.

On our own. Left alone. Free to love in peace.



Del

Time to simply sit and breathe.



Christine

Time to learn how to believe.



Both

And give thanks for our release,

To love in peace.



Christine

Time to dance and time to grow.



Del

Time to learn and time to know.



Both

Time to prosper and increase.

Make love in peace.



Sometimes i get

On my knees and pray

For that one

Ordinary day

When all the pain will fin'lly cease.

Then we'll be free

To love in peace.



Del

Just for fun



Christine

Think of one



Both

Ordinary day.
