Feel the passion and feel the heat.

Football is the only reason

God almighty gave us feet.

Kick it out mate! What a ball hog!

Dozy wanker shift your arse!



Two nil!



You dirty bastard.

We'll have the last word.



Come and have a go.

Have some of that.

You think you're hard but we know you're crap.



Let's have another.

Just like the other.



Come on!

Raise your voice for the people's sport.

Those who play. Those who support.

'Cos it's better than sex and it's better than

Beer so

Soccer the game.
