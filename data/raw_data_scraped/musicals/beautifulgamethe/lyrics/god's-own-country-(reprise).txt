God's Own Country (Reprise)


Mary, christine and del

So farewell to god's own country.

We are irish and we sail upon the tide.

Gone to seek a better place

It's the story of our race.



Tears have always flowed from god's own country.

The nation's children scattered far and wide.

But no matter where we roam

We will still call ireland home.



If we never do return to god's own country,

We will carry it within us 'til we die.

Yes a new course is set but we'll never forget

What we owe to the country where our forefathers lie.

Though we know we must part it's with such heavy heart,

And with tears in our eyes that we say our last goodbye.



So farewell to god's own country.

We are irish and we sail upon the tide.

Gone to seek a better place,

It's the story of our race.
