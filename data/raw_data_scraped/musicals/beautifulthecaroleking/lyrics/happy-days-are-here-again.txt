Happy Days Are Here Again


CYNTHIA:

I'd like to say a thing or two

About this song I sing for you

These are not the words you thought you knew

To Happy Days Are Here Again



There's a reason for the switch

I'm making a creative pitch

With the words I wrote without a hitch

To Happy Days Are Here Again



I came to show you my style

My name is Cynthia Weil

W-E-I-L



My lyrics will be slick and smart

Reminding you of Lorenz Hart

And we'll both sing when we top the chart

Happy Days Are Here Again!



Take me home!



You want a sonnet

I'll get right on it

I like a good rhyme

More than a good time

My pen's on fire

And I'm for hire



Donny let me write for you
