Some Kind of Wonderful


All you have to do is touch my hand

To show me you understand

And something happens to me

That's some kind of wonderful



Anytime my little world is blue

I just have to look at you

And everything seems to be

Some kind of wonderful



I know I can't express

This feeling of tenderness

There's so much I want to say

But the right words just don't come my way



I just know when I'm in your embrace

This world is a happy place

And something happens to me

That's some kind of wonderful



Some kind of wonderful

(Sweet lips)

Some kind of wonderful

Wonderful, wonderful

(Warm eyes)

(Soft sighs)

Some kind of wonderful



Some kind of wonderful

(Sweet lips)

Some kind of wonderful

Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful

(Warm eyes)

Some kind of wonderful

(Soft sighs)
