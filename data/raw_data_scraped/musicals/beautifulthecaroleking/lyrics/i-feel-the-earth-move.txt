I Feel the Earth Move


I feel the earth move under my feet

I feel the sky tumbling down, tumbling down

I feel my heart start to trembling

Whenever you're around



Ooh, baby, when I see your face

Mellow as the month of May

Oh, darling, I can't stand it

When you look at me that way



I feel the earth move under my feet

I feel the sky tumbling down, tumbling down

I feel my heart start to trembling

Whenever you're around



Oh, darling, when you're near me

And you tenderly call my name

I know that my emotions

Are something I just can't tame

I've just got to have you, baby



I feel the earth move under my feet

I feel the sky tumbling down, tumbling down

I feel the earth move under my feet

I feel the sky tumbling down

I just lose control

Down to my very soul

I get a hot and cold all over

I feel the earth move under my feet

I feel the sky tumbling down,

Tumbling down, tumbling down...
