One Fine Day


One fine day

You'll look at me

And you will know our love was meant to be

One fine day

You're gonna want me for your girl



The arms I long for

Will open wide

And you'll be proud to have me walking right by your side

One fine day

You're gonna want me for your girl



Though I know you're the kind of a boy

Who only wants to run around

I'll keep waiting

And some day, darling

You'll come to me when you want to settle down



Oh, one fine day

We'll meet once more

And then you'll want the love you threw away before

One fine day

You're gonna want me for your girl x3



Carole:



Though I know you're the kind of boy who only wants to run around

I'll keep waiting

And someday darling

You'll come to me when you want to settle down

Oh

One fine day

We'll meet once more

And then you'll want the love you threw away before

One fine day

You're gonna want me for your girl x3
