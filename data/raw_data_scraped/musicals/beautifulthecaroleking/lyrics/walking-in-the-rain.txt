Walking in the Rain


Barry:

I want her and I need her

And someday someway woah I'll need her

She'll be kinda shy, and real good looking too

And I'll be certain she's my girl by the things she'll like to do

Like walking in the rain and wishing on the stars up above and being so in love



(Spoken)

Barry:

Move in with me, at least move in with me



Cynthia:

It isn't done! It's like something out of a Baulsak novel



Barry:

Then marry me!



Cynthia:

ok I'll move in with you! Maybe that'll hold you



Barry:

Not for long..



(Singing)

Cynthia:

When he's near me, I'll kiss him

when he leaves me woah

I'll miss him



Barry:

Though sometimes we fight



Cynthia:

I won't really care



Both:

And I know it's gonna be alright

Cause we've got so much we share



Barry:

Like walking in the rain



Cynthia:

Oooo



Both:

And wishing on the stars up above



Barry:

And being so in love



(In canon)

Cynthia:

Like walking in the rain



Barry:

Like walking in the rain



Cynthia:

And wishing on the stars



Barry:

And wishing on the stars

And being so in love
