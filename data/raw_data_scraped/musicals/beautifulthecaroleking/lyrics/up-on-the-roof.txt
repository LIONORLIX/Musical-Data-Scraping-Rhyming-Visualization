Up on the Roof


When this old world starts getting me down

And people are just too much for me to face

I climb way up to the top of the stairs

And all my cares just drift right in to space



On the roof it's peaceful as can be

And there the world below can't bother me



Let me tell you now

When I come home feelin' tired and beat

I go up where the air is fresh and sweet

I get away from the hustling crowds

And all that rat race noise down in the street



On the roof's the only place I know

Where you just have to wish to make it so

Oh, let's go

up on the roof



At night the stars put on a show for free

And darling, you can share it all with me



I keep a-telling you

Right smack down in the middle of town

I found a paradise that's trouble proof

So if this world starts getting you down

there's room enough for two up on the roof



Up on the roof

Everyhting's all right

Up on the roof

Oh, come on baby

Up on the roof

Up on the roof
