You've Got a Friend


CAROLE:

When you're down and troubled

And you need some loving care

And nothing, whoa, nothing is going right

Close your eyes and think of me

And soon I will be there

To brighten up even your darkest nights



You just call out my name

And you know where ever I am

I'll come running

To see you again

Winter, spring, summer, or fall,

All you have to do is call

And I'll be there, yes I will

You've got a friend



CYNTHIA AND BARRY:

Hey, ain't it good to know that you've got a friend?

When people can be so cold

They'll hurt you



KIRSCHNER:

Yes, and desert you



CAROLE, CYNTHIA & BARRY:

They'll take your soul if you let them

Oh, but don't you let them



You just call out my name

And you know where ever I am

I'll come running, running, hey yeah

To see you again

Winter, spring, summer, or fall,

All you have to do is call

And I'll be there, yes I'll be there



You've got a friend
