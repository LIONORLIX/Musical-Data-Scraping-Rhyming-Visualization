Chains


Chains, my baby's got me locked up in chains

And they ain't the kind that you can see

Whoa, it's chains of love got a hold on me, yeah



Chains, well, I can't break away from these chains

Can't run around

'Cause I'm not free

Whoa, these chains of love won't let me be, yeah



Now believe me when I tell you

I think you're fine

I'd like to hold you

But I can't break away from all of these chains



My baby's got me locked up in chains

And they ain't the kind that you can see

Whoa, it's chains of love got a hold on me, yeah



I wanna tell you, pretty baby

Your lips look sweet

I'd like to kiss them

But I can't break away from all these chains



My baby's got me locked up in chains

And they ain't the kind that you can see

Whoa, it's chains of love got a hold on me, yeah



My baby's got me locked up in chains

And they ain't the kind that you can see

Whoa, it's chains of love got a hold on me, yeah



Chains, chains of love

Chains of love

Chains of love

Oh, these chains of love got a hold on me
