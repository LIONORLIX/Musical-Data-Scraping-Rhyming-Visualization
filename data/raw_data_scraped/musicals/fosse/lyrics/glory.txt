Glory


Blood!



Blood is red as sunset

Blood is warmer than wine

The taste of salty summer brine

Uh huh



Steel!



ALL

Steel is cold as moonlight

Steel as sharper than sight

The touch of bitter winter white



SOLDIERS

Shout it out from the highest tower

shout it out in the darkest hour

Charlemagne, you lead us on to



ALL

Power!
