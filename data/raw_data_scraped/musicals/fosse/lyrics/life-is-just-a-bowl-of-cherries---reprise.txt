Life Is Just A Bowl Of Cherries - Reprise


Life is just a bowl of cherries

Don't take it serious,

Life's too mysterious

You work,

You save,

You worry so

But you can't take your dough

When you go, go, go



So keep repeating "It's the berries."

The strongest oak must fall

The sweet things in life

To you were just loaned

So how can you lose

What you've never owned



Life is just a bowl of cherries

So live and laugh,

Laugh and love

Live and laugh at it all!



So keep repeating "It's the berries."

The strongest oak must fall

The sweet things in life

To you were just loaned

So how can you lose

What you've never owned



Life is just a bowl of cherries

So live and laugh, aha!

Laugh and love

Live and laugh,

Laugh and love,

Live and laugh at it all!
