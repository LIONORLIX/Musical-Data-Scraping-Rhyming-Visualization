Nowadays/The Hot Honey Rag


It's good, isn't it?

Grand, isn't it?

Great, isn't it?

Swell, isn't it?

Fun, isn't it?

Nowadays



There's man, everywhere

Jazz, everywhere

Booze, everywhere

Life, everywhere

Joy, everywhere

Nowadays



You can like the life you're living

You can live the life you like

You can even marry Harry

But mess around with Ike, huh!

And that's



Good, isn't it?

Grand, isn't it?

Great, isn't it?

Swell, isn't it?

Fun, isn't it...

But nothing stays



In fifty years or so

It's gonna change, you know

But, oh, it's heaven

Nowadays



And that's

Good, isn't it?

Grand, isn't it?

Great, isn't it?

Swell, isn't it?

Fun, isn't it?

But nothing stays



In fifty years or so

It's gonna change, you know

But, oh, it's heaven

Nowadays
