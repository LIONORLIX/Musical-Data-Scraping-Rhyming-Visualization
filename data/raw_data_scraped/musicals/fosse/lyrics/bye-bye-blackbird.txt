Bye Bye Blackbird


Pack up all my care and woe,

Here I go,

Singing low,

Bye bye blackbird,

Where somebody waits for me,

Sugar's sweet, so is she,

Bye bye

Blackbird!



No one here can love or understand me,

Oh, what hard luck stories they all hand me,

Make my bed and light the light,

I'll be home late tonight,

Blackbird bye bye.



Pack up all my care and woe,

Here I go,

Singing low,

Bye (bye) bye (bye) blackbird.

(tchoo tchoo tchoo tchoo tchoo tchoo)

Where somebody waits for me,

Sugar's sweet, so is she,

Bye (bye) bye (bye) blackbird.

(tchoo tchoo tchoo tchoo tchoo tchoo)



No one here can love or understand me,

Oh, what hard luck stories they all hand me,

(Oh oh oh oh)

Make my bed, light that light,

I'll be home late tonight,

Blackbird...



Make my bed and light the light,

I'll be home late tonight,

Leave you bird jet in the sky

Toodle oo!

Farewell!

Bye bye!



Blackbird

(Blackbird,Blackbird)

We'll take the flying little blackbird bye!
