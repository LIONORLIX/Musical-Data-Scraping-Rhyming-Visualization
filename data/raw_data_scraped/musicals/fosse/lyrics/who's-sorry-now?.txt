Who's Sorry Now?


Who's sorry now, who's sorry now?

Whose heart is aching for breaking each vow?

Who's sad and blue, who's crying too?

Just like I cried over you...



Right to the end, just like a friend,

I tried to warn you, somehow,

Aaaaaaaaahhh!

You had your way, now you must pay,

We're glad that you're sorry now.
