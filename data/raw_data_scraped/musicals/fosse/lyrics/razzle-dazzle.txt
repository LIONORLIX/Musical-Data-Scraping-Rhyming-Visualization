Razzle Dazzle


Give 'em the old razzle dazzle

Razzle dazzle 'em

Give 'em an act with lots of flash in it

And the reaction will be passionate

Give 'em the old hocus pocus

Bread and feather 'em

How can they see with sequins in their eyes?

Long as you keep 'em way off balance

How can they spot you got no talents?

Razzle dazzle 'em

And they'll never catch wise!



Give 'em the old razzle dazzle

Razzle dazzle 'em

Back since the days of old Methuselah

Everyone loves the big bambooz-a-ler



Give 'em the old

Double whammy

When you're in trouble, go into your dance

Though you are stiffer than a girder

They let ya get away with a murder

Razzle dazzle 'em

Razzle dazzle 'em

Razzle dazzle 'em

And you've got a romance
