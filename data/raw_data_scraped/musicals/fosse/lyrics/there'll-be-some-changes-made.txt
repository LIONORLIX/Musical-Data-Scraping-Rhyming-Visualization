There'll Be Some Changes Made


You better change your way of livin'

And if that ain't enough

(she's right you better listen!)

You better change your way you strut your stuff

'Cause nobody wants you when you're old and gray

You better change your way today

You better change your way...



- Can you hear me ? I'm talking to ya!

- You gotta lay off the boose!

- abstain and vitamins!

- You better stop screwing around!



You better stop

You better change

You better stop

You better change

You better stop

You better change

You better stop

You better change

You better stop

You better change and change your way today!

I said stop, change, stop, please!

Please!Please!Please!Please!Please!
