Good lord!

Da da da da

Da da da da da

Dee dee dee dum



I got a song been on my mind

And the tune can be sung and the words all rhyme

Deedle-ee deet deet deet deet deet deet deet dee deedle-ee doo



Though it don't say much and it won't offend

If you sing it in school then they're liable to send you home

Never knowing what you're showin'

Think you're growin' your own tea

Good lord!



Let me hear that!

Let me hear that!

Crunchy granola's suite

Sing it out

Alright



I know a man was outta touch

And he'd hide in a house and he didn't say much

Deedle-ee deet deet deet deet deet deet deet deedle-ee doo



And like a man with a tiger outside his gate

He not only couldn't relax but he couldn't relate

Now he can

Family man

Tried my brand

Dig



Let me hear that!

Let me hear that!

Crunchy granola's suite

Drop your shrink and stop your drinkin'

Crunchy granola's neat

Sing it out

Alright



Da da da da

Da da da da da

Dee dee dee dum
