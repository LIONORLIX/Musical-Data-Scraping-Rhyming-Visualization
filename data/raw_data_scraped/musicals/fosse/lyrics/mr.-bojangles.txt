Mr. Bojangles


I knew a man Bojangles

And he danced for you

In worn out shoes



With silver hair, a ragged shirt

And baggy pants, the old soft shoe



He jumped so high,

He jumped so high,

Then he lightly touched down



Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles,

Mr. Bojangles, dance!



I met him in a cell in New Orleans,

I was down and out

He looked to be the eyes of age as spoke right out

He talked of life,

He talked of life,

He laughed, slapped his leg a step



He said his name, Bojangles,

Then he danced a lick across the cell

He grabbed pants of better stants,

Then he jumped up high, he clicked his heels

He let go a laugh,

He let go a laugh, shook back his clothes all around



Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles,

Mr. Bojangles, dance!

La-dee da da...

Hum-um-um...

Dee-dah-dah-dah



He danced for those at minstrel shows

And county fairs throughout the south

He spoke with tears of 15 years

How his dog and he traveled about

His dog up and died, up and died,

After 20 years he still grieved



He said I dance now at ev'ry chance

In honky tonks for drinks and tips

But most of the time

I spend behind these county bars

He said 'I drinks a bit'

He shook his head

And as he shook his head

I heard someone ask "Please!"

"Please!"



Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles,

Mr. Bojangles, dance!

La-dee da da...

Hum-um-um...

Dee-dah-dah-dah

Dance! Dance! Dance!
