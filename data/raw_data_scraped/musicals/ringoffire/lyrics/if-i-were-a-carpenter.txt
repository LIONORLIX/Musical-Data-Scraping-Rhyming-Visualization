If I Were A Carpenter




If i were a carpenter

And you were a lady,

Would you marry me anyway?

Would you have my baby?



If a tinker were my trade

Would you still find me,

Carrying the pots i made,

Following behind me.



Save my love through loneliness,

Save my love for sorrow,

I'm given you my onliness,

Come give your tomorrow.



If i worked my hands in wood,

Would you still love me?

Answer me babe, "yes i would,

I'll put you above me."



If i were a miller

At a mill wheel grinding,

Would you miss your color box,

And your soft shoe shining?



If i were a carpenter

And you were a lady,

Would you marry me anyway?

Would you have my baby?

Would you marry anyway?

Would you have my baby?
