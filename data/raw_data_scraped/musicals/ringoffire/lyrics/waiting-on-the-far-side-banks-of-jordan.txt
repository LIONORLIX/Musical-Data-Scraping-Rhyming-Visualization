Waiting on the Far Side Banks of Jordan


I'll admit my steps are growing wearier each day

Still i've got a certain journey on my mind

Lures of this old world have ceased to make me want to stay

My one regret is leaving you be-hind



If it proves to be his will that i am first to cross

And somehow i've a feeling it will be

When it comes your turn to travel likewise don't feel lost

For i will be the first one that you'll see



Chorus:

And i'll be waiting on the far side banks of jordan

I'll be sitting drawing pictures in the sand

And when i see you coming i will rise up with a shout

And come running through the shallow water reaching for your hand



Through this life we've laboured long to earn our meagre fare

It's brought us trembling hands and failing eyes

So i'll just rest there on that shore and turn my eyes away

Until you come then we'll see para-dise



Repeat chorus x 2
