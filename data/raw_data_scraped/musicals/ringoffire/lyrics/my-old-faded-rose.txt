My Old Faded Rose


Oh, you have got them all hanging around

Like the fringes on your gown

You're picking them up and a laying them low

My old faded rose

Was it me that said you're getting old

And a losing your appeal

Was it me that said you're growing cold

And I wanted another deal

Well, I see that you're not wilted

But you never did let it show

Why didn't I know about the fiery glow

In my old faded rose

My old faded rose

With your petals hanging down

I didn't know I'd miss you so

My old faded rose

Oh, look at them hanging around

Like the fringes on your gown

You're picking them up and a laying them low

My old faded rose

I didn't mean that the grass was green

While your leaves is turning brown

Now don't take me so seriously

When I tell you don't hang around

But now I see you don't need pruning

And who do you suppose

Is back in line for one more time

After his old faded rose

My old faded rose

With your petals hanging down

I didn't mean I'd miss you so

My old faded rose

Look at them hanging around

Like the fringes on your gown

You're picking them up and laying them low

My old faded rose
