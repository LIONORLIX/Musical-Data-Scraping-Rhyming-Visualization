Temptation


Johnny:

Oh, tell me will you, darling

Why you look so bad tonight

You got bags around your eyeballs

That are red instead of white



June Carter:

Well, let me put it this way, you came, I was alone

Shucks, I should a knowed that you was temptation

You smiled a leering me on, my heart is plumb gone

Cause you was temptation



June:

It’ll be thrilling if you’re willing

But if it never can be then a pity for me

For you was too bored to be kissed

I couldn’t resist cause you was temptation and I was yours



Johnny:

As the apple tempted Adam

As the serpent tempted Eve

As the willow tree tempts the caterpillar, baby



June: That’s how you tempted me



Johnny:

As the corn liquor tempts the drunkard

As sorghum tempts the bee

As the mud hole tempts the mosquito, baby



June:

That’s how you tempted me

For you came and I was alone

Shucks, I should a knowed that you was temptation

(A ring-a-ding-ding-ding)

You smiled a leering me on my heart is plumb gone

For you was temptation



June:

It’ll be thrilling if you’re willing

But if it never can be then a pity for me

For you was too bored to be kissed

I couldn’t resist cause you was temptation and I was yours



June:

Here is my heart

Take it away, oh take it away

Say that we will never, never, never part



June:

I’m just a slave, just a dadburn slave

I’m a going to wed you

For you’re temptation and I’m a red hot flame

Johnny: Hot splinter

June: For you
