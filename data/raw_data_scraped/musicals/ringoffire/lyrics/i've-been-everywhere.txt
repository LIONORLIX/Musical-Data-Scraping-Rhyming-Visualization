I've Been Everywhere


I was totin my pack along the long dusty Winnamucka road

When along came a semi with a high canvas covered load

If your goin' to Winnamucka, Mack with me you can ride

And so I climbed into the cab and then I setteled down inside

He asked me if I'd seen a road with so much dust and sand

And I said, "Listen! I've traveled every road in this here land!"
