Start of Something New (Reprise)


TROY: It feels so right to be here with you

And now, looking in your eyes

I feel in my heart

The start of something new

Living in my own world

Didn't understand

That anything can happen

When you take a chance



GABRIELLA: I never believed in

What I couldn't see

I never opened my heart

To all the possibilities



BOTH: Oh, I know that something has changed

Never felt this way



GABRIELLA: I know it's for real



BOTH: This could be the start of something new



TROY: It feels so right



GABRIELLA: To be here with you



BOTH: Oh, and now, looking in your eyes

I feel in my heart

The start of something new
