Wildcat Cheer (Reprise)


All:

Wildcats, sing a-long. Yeah you really got it goin on

Wildcats in the house, Everybody say it now.

Wildcats everywhere, Wave your hands up in the air.

That's the way we do it, Let's get to it,

Time to show the world.



Wildcats everywhere, Wave your hands up in the air.

That's the way we do it, Let's get to it. C'mon, everyone!
