We're All in This Together (Reprise)


Together, together, together everyone

Together, together, come on let's have some fun

Together, were there for each other every time

Together together come on lets do this right



Here and now it's time for celebration

I finally figured it out (yeah yeah)

That all our dreams have no limitations

That's what it's all about



Everyone is special in their own way

We make each other strong (each other strong)

We're not the same

We're different in a good way

Together's where we belong



We're all in this together

Once we know

That we are

We're all stars

And we see that

We're all in this together

And it shows

When we stand

Hand in hand

Make our dreams come true



Together, together, together everyone

Together, together, come on let's have some fun

Together, were there for each other every time

Together together come on let's do this right



We're all here

and speaking out with one voice

we're going to rock the house (rock the house)

the party's on now everybody make some noise

come on scream and shout



We've arrived because we stuck together

Champions one and all



We're all in this together

Once we know

That we are

We're all stars

And we see that

We're all in this together

And it shows

When we stand

Hand in hand

Make our dreams come



We're all in this together

When we reach

We can fly

Know inside

We can make it

We're all in this together

Once we see

There's a chance

That we have

And we take it



Wild cats sing along

Yeah, you really got it goin' on

Wild cats in the house

Everybody say it now

Wild cats everywhere

Wave your hands up in the air

That's the way we do it

Let's get to it

Time to show the world



We're all in this together

Once we know

That we are

We're all stars

And we see that

We're all in this together

And it shows

When we stand

Hand in hand

Make our dreams come



We're all in this together

When we reach

We can fly

Know inside

We can make it

We're all in this together

Once we see

There's a chance

That we have

And we take it



Wild cats everywhere

Wave your hands up in the air

That's the way we do it

Let's get to it

Come on everyone!
