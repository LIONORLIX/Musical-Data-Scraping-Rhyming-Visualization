When There Was Me and You


WHEN THERE WAS ME AND YOU



GABRIELLA: It's funny when you find yourself

Looking from the outside

I'm standing here but all I want

Is to be over there

Why did I let myself believe

Miracles could happen?

?Cause now I have to pretend

That I don't really care

I thought you were my fairytale

A dream when I'm not sleeping



BRAINIACS: Ah?



GABRIELLA: A wish upon a star

That?s coming true



BRAINIACS: Coming true?



GABRIELLA: But everybody else could tell



BRAINIACS: Ah?



GABRIELLA: That I confused my feelings with the truth



BRAINIACS: With the truth?



GABRIELLA: When there was me and you



BRAINIACS: When there was me and you



TROY: I swore I knew the melody



JOCKS: I knew the song



TROY: That I heard you singing



JOCKS:I heard you singing



TROY: And when you smiled, you made me feel



JOCKS: You smiled and I feel



TROY: Like I could sing along



JOCKS: I could sing along



GABRIELLA: But then you went and changed the words

Now my heart is empty



TROY: I'm only left with used-to-be's



JOCKS: And now I?m left



TROY: And once upon a song



JOCKS: Once upon a song



GABRIELLA & TROY: Now I know you?re not a fairytale

And dreams were meant for sleeping

And wishes on a star

Just don't come true

And now even I can tell

That I confused my feelings with the truth

Because I liked the view



GABRIELLA: When there was me and you



TROY: I can't believe that I could be so blind



GABRIELLA: It's like you were floating

While I was falling

And I didn't mind



TROY: I didn?t mind



JOCKS/BRAINIACS: Oh?



TROY/GABRIELLA:  Why did I let myself believe



JOCKS/BRAINIACS: I believe



TROY/GABRIELLA: Miracles could happen?



JOCKS/BRAINIACS: In miracles



TROY/GABRIELLA: ?Cause now I have to pretend



JOCKS/BRAINIACS: ?Cause now I



TROY/GABRIELLA: That I don?t really care



JOCKS/BRAINIACS: Really care



TROY/GABRIELLA: I thought you were my fairy tale



JOCKS/BRAINIACS: You were my



TROY/GABRIELLA: My dream when I?m not sleeping



JOCKS/BRAINIACS: Fairy tale



TROY/GABRIELLA: A wish upon a star that?s coming true



JOCKS/BRAINIACS: A wish come true



TROY/GABRIELLA: But everybody else could tell



JOCKS/BRAINIACS: Everybody



TROY/GABRIELLA: That I confused my feelings for the truth



TROY: Because I liked the view



GABRIELLA: I thought you felt so too



TROY & GABRIELLA: When there was me

And you



JOCKS/BRAINIACS: Oooh?
