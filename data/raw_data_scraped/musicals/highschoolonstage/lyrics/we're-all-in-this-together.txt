We're All in This Together


CHAD:

Yesterday, we all were on our own road

We didn’t really know

GROUPS: Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh

TAYLOR:

That each of us, brings something to the table

To help the others grow.

GROUPS: Oh..................woo! (ascending)

ZEKE:

Now’s the chance, to take a new direction

KELSIE:

To see through other’s eyes

GROUPS: To see through other eyes!

MARTHA COX:

To make a choice

ZEKE:

To make a new connection

GROUPS: Oo!.......(ascending then descending)

TAYLOR:

To win the bigger prize.

ALL:

We're all in this together

Once we know

That we are

We're all stars

And we see that

We're all in this together

And it shows

When we stand

Hand in hand

Make our dreams come true.

JOCKS:

We're all here, and speaking out with one voice

We're going to rock the house







BRAINIACS:

Oo-wah Oo-wah

the party's on now everybody make some noise

Come on and scream and shout!



JOCKS:

Hey hey hey, woo (descending)



TAYLOR & CHAD:

We’ve arrived, because we stuck together

We make each other strong



JOCKS:

We’re not the same,



BRAINIACS:

We’re different in a good way



ALL:

Together’s where we belong

We're all in this together

When we reach

We can fly

Know inside

We can make it

We're all in this together

Once we see

There's a chance

That we have

And we take it.



Together, together, together everyone

Together, together, c’mon let’s have some fun!

Together, we’re there for,

Each other every time,

Together, together,

C’mon let’s do, c’mon let’s do, c’mon let’s do

Do this right!
