Alan (Sung with extreme nervousness):

Thought I was alone with no one to hold

but you were always there beside me!

I can make this happen, I know it in my heart

All I have to do is prove that I can play the part!

Bop bop bop, straight to the top!

Going for the glory! We'll keep stepping up

and we just won't stop 'till we reach the top!

Bop to the top!
