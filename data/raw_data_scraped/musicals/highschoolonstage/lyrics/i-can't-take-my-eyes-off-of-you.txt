I Can't Take My Eyes Off of You


TROY: Ya never know what you`re gonna feel, oh

Ya never see it comin` suddenly it`s real

GABRIELLA: Oh, it never even crossed my mind

That I could ever ever hope to find someone like you

BOTH: Oh, all things change

When you don`t expect them to

Oh, no one knows

GABRIELLA: What the future`s gonna do

TROY: I never even noticed

That you`ve been there all along

BOTH: I can`t take my eyes off of you

I know you feel the same way too

I can`t take my eyes off of you

All it took was one look

For a dream come true

TROY: Yeah, we got a good thing goin` on

GABRIELLA: Oh, right here is right where we belong

BOTH: You never really know what you might find

Now all I see is you and I

You`re everything I never knew

That I`ve been looking for

I can`t take my eyes off of you

I know you feel the same way too

I can?t take my eyes off of you

All it took was one look

For a dream come true

I can?t take my eyes off of you

Feelings like I never knew

I can`t take my eyes off of you

From the start, got my heart

Yeah, you do

Can`t take my eyes off you

TROY: You never know what you?re gonna feel

GABRIELLA: You never see it coming, suddenly, it?s real
