Breaking Free


BREAKING FREE



TROY: We`re soaring, flying

There`s not a star in heaven

That we can`t reach



GABRIELLA: If we`re trying

So we`re breaking free



TROY: You know the world can see us

In a way that`s different from who we are



GABRIELLA: Creating space between us

Till we`re separate hearts



BOTH: But your faith it gives me strength

Strength to believe



TROY: We`re breaking free



GABRIELLA: We`re soaring



TROY: Flying



BOTH: There`s not a star in heaven

That we can`t reach



TROY: If we`re trying



BOTH: Yeah, we`re breaking free



TROY: Yeah, we`re breaking free

Can you feel it building

Like a wave the ocean just can`t control



GABRIELLA: Connected by a feeling

Oh, in our very souls



TROY: In our very souls



BOTH: Rising till it lifts us up

So everyone can see



TROY: We`re breaking free



ALL: Soaring, flying

There`s not a star in heaven

That we can`t reach

If we`re trying

Yeah we`re breaking free



TROY/GAB: Oh, we?re breaking free



ALL (adding in one by one): Running, Climbing

To get to that place

To be all that we can be

Now`s the time

So we`re breaking free



TROY: More than hope

More than faith



GABRIELLA: This is truth

This is fate



TROY/GAB: And together We see it coming



GUYS: More than you, more than me



GIRLS: Not a want, but a need



ALL: All of us breaking free



(dialogue)



ALL: Soaring, Flying

There`s not a star in heaven

That we can`t reach

If we`re trying

Yeah we`re breaking free

Breaking free, breaking free

Running, Climbing

To get to that place

To be all that we can be

Now`s the time

So we`re breaking free

Now is the time to free us

To touch the sky, to reach for the highest star!

You know the world can see us

In a way that`s different than who we are
