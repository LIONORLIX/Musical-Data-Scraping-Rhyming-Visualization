Get Your Rock On




Everybody caught up in the wheel of fortune.

Virtual life, well it can get so boring.

Isolation,suffocation we all need a big vacation!



Just get lost in the wall of sound.

Music makes us come together now!

Don't you wanna get it

Gotta get it before it's gone

Cmon cmon getcha, getcha rock on!

Don't you wanna do it

Gotta do it that's what you want,

Cmon cmon getcha, getcha rock on!

Cmon cmon getcha, getcha rock on!



Don't you know it's all about the liberation?

Gotta use or lose it no hesitation.

Take a lesson,stop the stressin,

Here's a cure for your depression.



Just get lost in the wall of sound.

Music makes us come together now!

Don't you wanna get it

Gotta get it before it's gone

Cmon cmon getcha, getcha rock on!

Don't you wanna do it

Gotta do it that's what you want

Cmon cmon getcha, getcha rock on!



Everybody got their own music playin' round in their head!

But, when we all bring it together, ain't nothin' better ain't nothin' better!(oh oh oh!)



Don't you wanna get it

Gotta get it before it's gone(get what you want)

Cmon cmon getcha(getcha getcha rock on),getcha rock on!

Don't you wanna do it

Gotta do it that's what you want,

Cmon cmon getcha, getcha rock on!

Don't you wanna get it

Gotta get it before its gone

Cmon cmon getcha, getcha rock on!

Don't you wanna do it

Gotta do it that's what you want,

Cmon cmon getcha, getcha rock on!

Cmon cmon getcha, getcha rock on!

Cmon cmon getcha, getcha rock on!

Cmon cmon getcha, getcha rock on!

Cmon cmon getcha, getcha rock on!
