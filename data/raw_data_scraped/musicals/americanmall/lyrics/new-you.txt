New You


I've got a plan that can solve all your problems

Just think of me as your magical wand

You've got a dream and I've got connections

And we naturally bond

If you agree we can go in as partners

No other team's ever been quite this hot

You might be scared but there's nothing to lose

You can leave if you choose but I bet you will not



Take a look at the new you

Imagine how it would feel

If what you see could be real

What you want could be true

Its the new you, new you, new you, the new you



I know you want all the things I can offer

I see your face next to mine on tv

your band will play and we'll all scream you name

You'll have cash, you'll have fame, and you'll even have me



Take a look at the new you

Imagine how it would feel

If what you see could be real

What you want could be true

So take a look at the new you



Try on the clothes you will wear

Come take a step if you dare

Time to make your debut



New you, new you, new you, the new you, new you, new you, the new you

Oooo, ahhh, oooo, ahhh



Take a look at the new you

Imagine how it will feel

What you see can be real

What you want can be true



Take a look at the new you

How does it feel to be a star

Cause thats exactly what you are



Take a look at the new you
