Sorry's Not Enough


I'm sorry can't save a heart

When it breaks and scattered in the wind

How can two worlds cover the half

The others been living in



Oh I never believed I'd ever need

Any more than I did before



When sorry's not enough

There's nowhere left to turn

Too much to forgive

Tell me where is the answer

How do you find the strength

The strength to let it go

We need to just to leave

When sorry's not enough



Love can fall hard

Leaving the scar that remembers

How bad it burns

We won't pretend where next time begins

Cause we need just to live and learn



Although now I believe that I'm gonna need

A little more than I did before



Sorry's not enough

There's nowhere left to turn

Too much to forgive

Tell me where is the answer

How do you find the strength

The strength to let it go

We need to just to leave

When sorry's not enough



No there's no going back

And tomorrow is all we're gonna have

So we will have



Sorry's not enough

There's nowhere left to turn

Too much to forgive

Tell me where is the answer

How do you find the strength

The strength to let it go

We need to just to leave

Oh just to leave baby

Sorry's not enough
