Dreaming Wide Awake


When gray meets light

It creates new colors

That stay lost inside

Till they find each other



Then the world that you've never seen before

Starts moving in slow motion



Am I living now out loud

'Cause I can't hide me from you

And I'm not afraid somehow

To let you see right through me

Wait, I must be dreaming wide awake



This world's so real

Like a kaleidoscope made clear

To touch, to feel

What if we made it disappear



With just a tangle, you might change

I'd rather breathe this moment



Am I living now out loud

'Cause I can't hide me from you

And I'm not afraid somehow

To let you see right through me

Wait, I must be dreaming wide awake



Am I living now out loud

'Cause I can't hide me from you

And I'm not afraid somehow

To let you see right through me

No

Am I living now out loud

'Cause I can't hide me from you

And I'm not afraid somehow

To let you see right through me

I must be dreaming wide awake

I must be dreaming

I must be dreaming wide awake
