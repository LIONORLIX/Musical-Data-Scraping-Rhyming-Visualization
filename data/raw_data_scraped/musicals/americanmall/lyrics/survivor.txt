Survivor


I just woke up from a fractured fairy tale

I bought the dream but didn't read the small details

Oh which road I should take, I thought I could see it

You led me ashtray and now I feel cheated

I let you break my heart and bleed it

I know it



But I finally learned that I hate to lose

Found out something I gotta prove



I'm a survivor

Scream it loud and strong

I'm a survivor

That's right, bring it on



I'm taking back the part I gave away

And I'll never do it again unless it's an even trade

I opened my heart, like a fool I trusted

A light in the dark, until you unplugged it

Love left a mark but I rise above it

I know it



Every mistake that I ever made

Made me who I am today



I'm a survivor

Scream it loud and strong

I'm a survivor

That's right, bring it on



The princess opens up her eyes without a kiss

For that she won't forgive

Because this good girl's pissed...!



I'm a survivor

Scream it loud and strong

I'm a survivor

That's right, bring it on





Every mistake that I ever made

Made me who I am today



I'm a survivor

Scream it loud and strong

I'm a survivor

That's right, bring it on!
