Little Bit of Heart Somewhere


Show me...

A little bit of heart somewhere

So I feel relieved

Show me...

A little bit of heart somewhere

So I feel relieved



[ Chorus ]

Hey Sugar Hey Sugar Hey

That sweet face aint gonna tempt me

Hey Sugar Hey Sugar Hey

Hey Sugar dont care what you say

None of that sweet talk gonna get me

Hey Sugar Hey Sugar Hey



Show me...

A little bit of truth somewhere

So I feel at ease

Yea

Show me...

A little bit of truth somewhere

So I feel at ease



[ Chorus ]

Hey Sugar Hey Sugar Hey

That sweet face aint gonna tempt me

Hey Sugar Hey Sugar Hey

Hey Sugar dont care what you say

None of that sweet talk gonna get me

Hey Sugar Hey Sugar Hey



Na.... huh huh huh

huh huh

Little bit of heart somewhere

Na.....huh huh huh

Na huh

Little bit of heart somewhere



Oh... redemption

Is yours for the prize

Morning... after

Morning... night

Paint my picture

Play your game

No matter how you try to hurt me

It will be in vain





Hey Sugar Hey Sugar Hey

Your sweet face aint gonna tempt me

Hey Sugar.... Hey

I.. dont care what you say

None of that sweet talk gonna get me

Hey Sugar Hey Sugar Hey



[ Chorus ]

Hey Sugar Hey Sugar Hey

That sweet face aint gonna tempt me ( Sugar, Sugar )

Hey Sugar Hey Sugar Hey

Hey Sugar dont care what you say

Hey Sugar Hey Sugar Hey

Your sweet face aint gonna tempt me

Hey Sugar Hey Sugar Hey

( Little bit of heart somewhere )

Hey Sugar dont care what you say

None of that sweet talk gonna tempt me

Hey Sugar Hey Sugar Hey
