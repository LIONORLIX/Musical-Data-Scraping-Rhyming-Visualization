On the Other Side


MR. RUSSELL

NOT TOO LATE FOR US TO TURN BACK.

WHO’S TO BLAME US IF WE DO?

HELL, I KNOW I MUST BE CRAZY TO BE TALKIN? SENSE TO YOU. WE’VE PAID THE PASSAGE WITH OUR PRIDE.

GUESS WE’LL SEE IF IT WAS WORTH IT

ON THE OTHER SIDE.

OUR DEAL IS A DEAL

THAT ONLY FOOLS WOULD MAKE.

OUR DEAL IS A DEAL

THAT EVEN FOOLS LIKE US WON’T BREAK.

NO IDEA WHERE THIS IS GOIN?. NO IDEA HOW THIS WILL END. GUESS YOU’LL HAVETA CALL ME CRAZY

SINCE I LEARNED TO CALL

YOU ‘FRIEND.’

WE’RE IN TOGETHER FOR

THE RIDE.



YOU CAN COUNT ON ME TO MEET YOU,

I WILL BE THE FIRST TO GREET YOU

ON THE OTHER SIDE
