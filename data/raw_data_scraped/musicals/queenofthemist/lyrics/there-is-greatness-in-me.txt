There Is Greatness In Me


ANNA EDSON TAYLOR has appeared. SHE’s an older woman; dressed in a worn outfit from the turn of the century, 1900. She is in the city of Indianapolis. MR. MALLARDO addresses her.

MR. MALLARDO

Miss Taylor---

ANNA

Mr. Mallardo! Come to take a dance lesson?

MR. MALLARDO

Miss Taylor---

ANNA

Mrs. Taylor. I was married once, but my husband died early in our marriage. He never drank and I do believe that is what killed him.



MR. MALLARDO

Your rent must be paid within the week or you’ll be evicted.

ANNA

A week?

MR. MALLARDO

A week.

ANNA dons an absurd hat, packs her bags and journeys to Snadusksy, Ohio.

ANNA

THERE IS GREATNESS IN ME. IT SHALL BE REVEALED.

I HAVE GREATNESS IN ME.

IT CAN’T BE CONCEALED.

I SHALL PROVOKE A WORLD SENSATION.

BREAK DOWN MORE DOORS THAN CARRIE NATION.

THE HOI POLLOI WILL ALL AGREE:

THERE IS GREATNESS IN ME.

MRS. GUMSTOCK appears.

ANNA

Mrs. Gumstock----how lovely to receive you! Have you come for a hygenics lesson?

MRS. GUMSTOCK

Mrs. Taylor, the rent on your studio is overdue---

ANNA

Yes, Mrs. Gumstock---and I will pay you all of which you are owed as soon as I am paid all which I am owed by my students.



MRS. GUMSTOCK

Mrs. Taylor, you have no----

ANNA



No students! And isn’t that a terrible reflection on our lovely community of Sandusky; a terrible reflection of the state

of female hygenics and fitness that women cannot---no!----will not take the necessary time and energy to concern themselves with a proper physical program! We are becoming a nation of bovine creatures, Mrs. Gumstock- --overfed, cud-chewing, bovine creatures, slouching our way to the slaughterhouse! Why, when

I was studying in New Haven for my teaching degree in physical education, all I did was exercise! Exercise! Men appreciate that--- even at my age, men appreciate me and I intend to keep it that way! And I may also compliment you in the appreciative glances you have been receiving of late from that handsome Mr. Colby: he is a man’s man, un homme des hommes! No wonder other men are jealous of him---your dear, old Mr. Gumstock must be, too, oh he must be!----for Mr. Colby is a fine specimen---



MRS. GUMSTOCK

Mrs. Taylor! Pay your rent...or I and Mr. Gumstock---will have to make you leave.

ANNA

A week.

MRS. GUMSTOCK

No. By Friday.

ANNA

Friday...

MRS. GUMSTOCK exits. Anna dons another absurd hat, takes her traveling bag and journeys to Bay City, Michigan.

ANNA

THERE IS GREATNESS IN ME WOE TO YE WHO DOUBT. THERE IS GREATNESS IN ME. TIME WILL BEAR IT OUT.

I MAY NOT LOOK LIKE LILLIAN RUSSELL

BUT I CAN STILL FILL OUT A BUSTLE.

WHY IS IT THUS NO ONE CAN SEE:

THERE IS GREAT---

OFFICER DARLING appears.

OFFICER DARLING

Anna Edson Taylor, I have a claim brought against you in

the amount of one hundred and twenty-two dollars and three cents that you are ordered to pay

in full or surrender the premises on which you conduct...

ANNA

Music lessons. Mr...?

OFFICER DARLING

Officer Darling.

ANNA

Officer Darling. Yes. I teach classes in musical education

but not standard practice by any means---I teach a revolutionary new system of learning music that is a sensation! Through

a system of massage and

muscle manipulation: massage and manipulate, massage and manipulate---Anyone can learn: the portals are opened and

the joys of music are no longer consigned to the ecclesiastic gatekeepers but now can be shared with the masses----even you, Officer Darling---darling Officer Darling! Alas, no one here in Bay City----sad, little, non- revolutionary Bay City--is eager to try the new----to dare to venture! No, not here. No one dares to

be transported, and that’s what music does, Officer Darling--

-it transports! We can literally traverse time and place! Do you travel? I myself have traveled to the Florida Straits, sailed to Cuba during a hurricane, journeyed by rail to the wilds of Texas where armed robbers held up the train and demanded money from me-- -eight hundred dollars concealed in my undergarments! But I said no! Blow away! I’d rather lose my brains than not have money! And they let me keep it!



OFFICER DARLING

I’d get out of town tonight, Ma’am.



ANNE

Tonight.
