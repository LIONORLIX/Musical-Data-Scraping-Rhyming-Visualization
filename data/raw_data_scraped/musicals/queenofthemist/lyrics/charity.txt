CHARITY

IS THE POOR MAN’S LAST RESORT. (BUM, BUM, BUM) CHARITY

IS THE RICH MAN’S FINEST SPORT.

IF YOU’RE BROKEN, DRUNK AND DESOLUTE

AND YOUR DEAR OLD PALS DON’T GIVE A HOOT

GRAB AN OLD TIN CUP AND TATTERED SUIT

AND PLEAD

YOUR NEED

FOR CHARITY...

Jane is outside the bathroom door.

JANE

Anna, we cannot allow you to bathe three times a day.

ANNA

Very well! I shall not bathe! I

shall march around like a wild, odiferous creature and the oh-so- clean, deliriously boring people of Auburn, New York will be content to mock and throw orange rinds at me, yelling: look at the dirty yak! ‘Dirty yak! Dirty yak!? But as they criticize me, remember they will be criticizing you!



ANNA insolently climbs out of the tub.

CHARITY

IS THE POOR MAN’S LAST RESORT.

ANNA

SO THIS IS HOW I END.

CHARITY

ANNA

IN AUBURN, NEW YORK.



PANHANDLERS

IS THE RICH MAN’S FINEST SPORT.

ANNA

LIVING AND DEAD.

PANHANDLERS

IN HER WEATHERED SHAWL AND FLAPPING BOOT,

A WOMAN’S SELF-RESPECT IS MOOT;

IF SHE’S TOO DECREPIT TO PROSTITUTE...

LET’S HEAR

A CHEER

FOR CHARITY...

JANE

Anna...My husband...We---

ANNA

I know what you will tell me. I have to leave.

JANE

(with a sob)

Oh, Anna...

ANNA

Why are you crying? You are not sixty-three-years-old and without money. You are not unwanted, Jane. You still have choices. Not many. But you still have choices for a way of life. Complacency breeds fear. I feel my death here.

THERE IS GREATNESS IN ME IT SHALL BE REVEALED.

18

BLINDING GREATNESS IN ME: IT CAN’T BE CONCEALED.

I CANNOT LIVE AS ORDINARY. I AM NOW HEADING TOWARD THE VERY

ESSENCE OF WHAT I AM MEANT TO BE:

WHAT AM I MEANT TO BE?

God help me. God? No. I will help myself. I have always had to help myself. Where to go?

A blast of a train whistle and steam.

A TRAIN CONDUCTOR

Next stop: Niagara Falls!
