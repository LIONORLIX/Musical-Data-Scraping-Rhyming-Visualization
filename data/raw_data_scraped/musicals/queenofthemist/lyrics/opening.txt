QUINTET

THE OAKEN BARREL WAS CAST ADRIFT

INTO WATERS SO COLD AND SWIFT;

EIGHT THOUSAND FEET ABOVE THE BRINK

OF THE FALL.

ON PAST THE RABBLE WHO LINED THE SHORES; GAMBLERS, GAWKERS, AND SAINTS AND WHORES.

WOULD SHE SURVIVE OR WOULD SHE SINK

IN THE FALL?

GREEN FOAM AND THUNDER BONE-CHILLING WONDER CLOSER, QUICKER, NEARER, FOLLY, BLUNDER:

SHE SUCCUMBED TO THE THRALL

OF THE THUNDER GOD?S CALL.

THE OAKEN BARREL, THE CASKET/WOMB TEETERED RIGHT ON THE

EDGE OF DOOM

AND PAUSED BUT ONCE AS IF TO THINK:

IS THIS ALL?

WHO CAN SAY WHAT HAPPENED IN THE FALL? WHO CAN SAY WHAT HAPPENED IN THE FALL?
