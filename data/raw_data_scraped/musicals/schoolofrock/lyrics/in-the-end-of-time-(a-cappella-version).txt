In the End of Time (A Cappella Version)


*It starts off...a dark stage and then a beam of light, and you can see me and my guitar*



In the end of time

There was a man who knew the road

And the writing, was written on the stone



*And then a thin layer of fog comes in around my ankles

Roadies that means dry ice we're gonna talk about this later*



In the ancient time

An artist led the way

But no one, seemed to understand



*Chimes, Freddy*



In his heart he knew

The artist must be true

But the legend, of the rent was way past due



*And then Katie you come in with the bass*



Well you think you'll be just fine...without me, but your mine!

You think you can, kick me out of the band



*And then Zach you come in with the face melter*

Well there's just one problem there

The band is mine

How can you kick me out...of what is mine



*And then...Hawaii 5-0, you ever see that show? O.K. well there's a drum solo in there...

Shigadugadugdugadugaduga*



You?re not hardcore

Unless you live hardcore



*And then... that's where I want the back-up singers to be like*



Well you?re not hardcore

(No you?re not hardcore)

Unless you live hardcore

(Unless you live hardcore)

But the legend of the rent was way hardcore



*Boom! Big ol' explosion...some like confetti comes down

Anyway, that's all I got so far, it's a work in progress*
