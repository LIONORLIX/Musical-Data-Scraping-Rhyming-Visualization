When I Climb to the Top of Mount Rock


I was strumming my axe

in my basement I

With my totally kick-ass band!

When an army of A&R men will arrive

with pens and contracts in hand!

Then they’ll whisk me away

in a big black car,

and the record accepts

and the girls will PR.

And they’ll know from the start

what a major league star

I will be!

Just wait and see!

When I climb to the top of Mountain Rock!

And there staring down from the heights.

With the crowd at my feet

and a 7 inch bulge

in my lizard skin spandex tights.

I’ll dive on an x rate into a crowd

When they’re screaming my name out loud.

And the gates will unlock!!!!

At the top of mount rock.

I’ll be blowin out amps

playing stadium shows

I’m a sold out gonctic tour!

I will blister the ears

of the first thousand rows

And leave while they beg for more!

And i’ll pop a champagne

And the party will rage

No brown M&Ms in my green room backstage.

Bigger than Hendrix, and Clapton, and Page

And the rest!

The all time best!!!!

When I climb to the top of mount rock!

And perched at the uppermost peak.

With a legion of groupies all dukin it out

For my chiseled wreck god physique

And i’ll spread hit singles all over the land!

With all of my 12 Grammys in hand

Watch the fan-boys all flock!!!!

At the top of Mount Rock.

All the doubters, and the haters,

and the hipsters, let ‘em laugh.

Cause they’ll all be beggin for my Roadie’s autograph.

I know my time is comin.

And hopefully it’s comin.

I’m pretty sure it’s comin any day!!!!

Once they hear me play!!!!!!!!

Then the dreams that I had since the day I turned 10

Will be finally comin true.

And no one’ll ever call me a loser again

Or tell me what I can’t do!

So I hold my head high and keep strumming those strings,

And grab any chance that my destiny brings.

And i’ll rise, and i’ll rise, and i’ll rise,

And the wings of my soul!!!!!

Up where I belong!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

And i’ll climb to the top of Mountain Rock!

And be part of that heavenly scene.

With Odin and Zeus on Bass and the drums

And Thor playing tambourine.

When Amus and Jambus and Judas appear!

And Jesus e’ll toss me a beer.

And we’ll jam ‘round the clock!!!!

At the top of Mount Rock!

At the top of Mount Rock!

At the top of Mount Rock!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
