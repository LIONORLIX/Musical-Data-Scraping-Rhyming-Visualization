WALTON (speaking)

Captain Robert Walton, in a letter to his sister - November 9th, 1793.

It was just north of the Arctic Circle that I discovered adrift, on a floe of ice

beside our ship, a wretch, near death.

In the days that followed he would tell me a tale strange and horrifying:

his life - a twisted path of destruction, his deeds - almost too incredible to recount.



FRANKENSTEIN

I am the innocent

I am the damned.



WALTON (speaking)

I alone know the heart of this man...



FRANKENSTEIN

A fount of delusion

A father of dreams.



WALTON (speaking)

...for I am still haunted by the faces of those he loved...



ALPHONSE FRANKENSTEIN

His adoring father, who could see in him only greatness.



CAROLINE BEAUFORT

The mother, whose loving spirit he could not bear to lose.



WILLIAM FRANKENSTEIN

The young brother, who worshipped him.



JUSTINE MORITZ

And the faithful servant, who understood why.



FRANKENSTEIN

I am not a madman!



HENRY CLERVAL

The soul who was his dearest friend in life.



WALTON

And the woman who, from their childhood days, had been his -



ELIZABETH

- one true love.



FRANKENSTEIN

I can hear my name!



WALTON

His story is the prophecy of nightmares.



FRANKENSTEIN

Blackened by my crime!



JUSTINE MORITZ

Yet it must be told.



FRANKENSTEIN

Haunting me and taunting

As it echoes through all time...



WALTON

His name... is Frankenstein.
