The Proposition


FRANKENSTEIN:

I created you with a noble purpose--

To free mankind from the fear of death!

If I had known it would lead to such bloodshed,

I would never have given you breath!



CREATURE:

Has it not pierced your brilliant mind,

Our actions cannot be undone?

I will reign fear upon your kind,

Unless you now complete what you've begun!



Listen carefully, Victor Frankenstein:

I have a proposition to present to you!

You have one chance to redeem your transgressions--

You have one last experiment to do!



Create a woman to share this strife,

Make her as vile as my darkest pain!

Grant me the joy of a kindred wife--

In return, you shall never see me again.



FRANKENSTEIN:

Never! Impossible! Preposterous!

Your scheme is outrageous, absurd!

One more just as monstrous--

I'll not inflict such horror on this world!



CREATURE:

What's wrong, what's right?

Do you decide?

I'm more than blood and bone!

I need a mate--

One made as I!

I won't exist alone!



FRANKENSTEIN:

Who are you to make demands,

Who's now twice a criminal--

My brother's blood upon your hands,

Asking me to serve your will!



A second beast to bring new terror

[Creature groans]

Upon the young and innocent?

I'll not willingly repeat my error!

You will not get my consent!



CREATURE:

Victor, you complete this task,

And end your family's mourning!

It's the last I'll ever ask.

The boy was just a warning!



Create another wretch as I,

A love I cannot be denied,

A soul content to live beside me.

I'll take my bride and run away,

Someplace safe where we can stay

Far from man and his insanity!



FRANKENSTEIN:

I think it wrong, I think it sick!

A corruption of biology!



CREATURE:

But here's your chance to make it right

And offer an apology!



FRANKENSTEIN:

Can I undo the great mistake?

Erase the sorrow from my wake,

Never again to face this demon?

And might I still attain the dream,

With now a woman as the means,

Bestowing life upon my mission?



FRANKENSTEIN, CREATURE, CHORUS:

Life everlasting, reanimation,

A flawless new design!

The finest woman in all creation,

And she will be--



CREATURE:

Mine!



FRANKENSTEIN:

But softer now! A female frame,

And agile hands required!

And one who was lost, may yet be reclaimed,

Reborn of heaven's fires!



CREATURE:

This is your chance! You will atone,

And never see me again!

Master your fate and face the unknown,

And bring this nightmare to an end!



FRANKENSTEIN:

This is my chance! I will atone!



CREATURE:

Here's your last chance to atone!



FRANKENSTEIN:

I'll finally know peace!



CREATURE:

As will I!



FRANKENSTEIN, CREATURE:

One more leap/One leap into the unknown,

And curse the name of Frankenstein!
