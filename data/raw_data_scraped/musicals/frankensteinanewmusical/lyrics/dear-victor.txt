Dear Victor


Elizabeth

Dear Victor, Sweet Victor.

I pray this finds you well.

Please now that we miss you

Much more than words can tell.

Are you consumed with study?

Your thoughts a world away

From all of those who love you

And hope for word each day.

I know your passion?s fury,

The dream you must pursue!

I only ask for compromise

Please realize,

My dream begins with you!



Victor

Elizabeth it pains me to have to keep this secret from you!

I?m so ashamed that this is all my many months of work have come to!

How I long to feel your warm embrace,

And kill this failure?s poison taste!



Elizabeth

Dear Victor, please answer

With words that reassure us!



Victor

I have no words to sooth her!



Elizabeth

My heart clings to mem?ries

Yet longs for something more!



Victor

I have no strength to find them now!



Elizabeth

Where is the man who held me?

Who made me feel his fire?

But does your silence prove it?s true?

I?ve lost you too!

Your only true desire!



Victor

If I could solve this mess I?d be in your loving arms forever!



Elizabeth

Dear Victor



Victor

Here I am, alone and lost a foolish failure forever!

Have gone where no man should dare go?



Elizabeth

What are you keeping from me?



Victor

Missing ev?ry dream I seek just beyond my reach!

What is missing, what is wrong?



Elizabeth

Dear Victor

Without you

Our house is not a home

Dear Victor

Return to us

I miss you so

I need you so.



Victor

You must never know!



Creature

Frankenstein!



Victor

Is it possible that retched beast is capable of learning?

Have I left my greatest work and all my dreams behind me burning?

I?ve done what I must!

Back to ash and dust that which never should have lived!



[Thanks to Elizabeth for lyrics]
