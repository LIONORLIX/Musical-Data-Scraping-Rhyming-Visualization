Birth To My Creation


Frankenstein:



Thrilling!

Awesome!

Spectacular!



Witness God in his heaven and play



Chilling!

Dazzling!

Sensational!



A most singular magnificent display!



An electrifying tapestry,

if it could only be controlled.

The sheer strength and the majesty...

Think of the power we could hold!



I want the world to see

Where my research has led.

Electricity's the key

To reanimate the dead!



I could rid the world of sickness

man would live in perfect health!

And only violence would cut short

this gift worth more than wealth



No consumption!

No cancer!

No lepers, cripples, gout.

In my hands I'll hold the answer

to what life is all about!



At Ingolstadt I'll have the means

to walk where few have trod!

I'll discover the secrets between

the alchemists and God!



(voice-over journal entries about the experiment run together)



Prometheus dared to steal fire from gods

to lift mankind from sorrow.

And just as the myth,

my mission is this:

To write a new tomorrow!



My endless days of study and toil

are finally near fruition.

The world will be forever changed

by history's physician(?)



The purest plasma!

Coursing freely,

Through artery and vein!

The finest tissue,

the perfect body,

Muscle, bone, and brain!



This storm will peak,

and the heavens part,

to fire my preparations.

The needed shock to start this heart

giving birth to my creation!



And now it's come,

the moment is right,

to awaken my creation!

I'll show the world,

this very night,

the way to man's salvation!
