Prelude


(In The darkness, we hear the sound of a small plane flying overhead.

Bill is lying on the ground; he wears a pilot's uniform. He picks

himself up and finds a raffle ticket in his hand.)



BILL:

All right, I understand. I've got three weeks. Three weeks.



Scene: The beach in front of the Steel Pier in Atlantic City



MR. WALKER:

All marathon dancers, sign up now at the Steel Pier! Sign up now!



BILL:

Excuse me, miss... do you have a partner yet?



RITA:

Do I! You should see who I'm dancing with.



BILL:

I thought you would. After all, you're

"Lindy's Lovebird."



RITA:

You remember?



MR. WALKER:

Last call for those without partners. Sign up or sign off.



BILL:

Well, I've got to go. I don't have a partner yet.



RITA:

Good luck, Flyboy. You never know who's waiting for you.



BILL:

Or how they'll change your life. (He exits)
