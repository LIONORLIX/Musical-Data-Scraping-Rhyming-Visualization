Steel Pier


Mick:

Hey what do you need that we don't have right here?

Everything's gonna be all right, rita. You'll see...



Life is a party

Why don't you come

To the steel pier?



No one's ever gloomy or glum

At the steel pier



Dip your toes into the ocean

Rub a little suntan lotion

Pay your dough and ride all the rides

Sit on the boardwalk

Watching the tides...



(the scene changes to the bandstand on the dance floor.)



Mick and mick's picks:

All atlantic city is proud

Of the steel pier mick's picks:

Steel pier



No place draws

A friendlier crowd

Than the steel pier



Mick's picks:

Steel pier

Mick:

So watch the joy go

On and on, ooh

Like some daffy marathon

Bring your troubles here

Watch them disappear

At the truly uproarious, aaah

Glamorous, glorious,



Mick and mick pick's:

Steel pier



Mick

Oh how our lovebird's heart must be breaking! Deserted by

The man she loves only moments ago. But she won't let go

Of her dream. No, no. She's going to dance with another

Partner - olympic champion, johnny adel!



(mick signals johnny to start dancing with rita,

But she pushes him away and refuses to move.)



Rita:

Life's a party

Why don't you come

To the steel pier?



Mick:

Come on, rita - dance with johnny.



Rita:

No one's ever

Gloomy or glum

At the steel pier



Mick:

Come on, baby, you don't want to be disqualified, do you?

Dance with johnny. That's a girl.

(to the crowc.)

What a sport, folks! What a sport!



Rita:

Rub a little suntan lotion.

Pay your dough be willing to ride

Sit on the boardwalk

Watching the tide



Mick:

Come on, sweetheart - keep moving now. That a girl.

Dance, rita. You hear me? Dance.

I'm warning you, rita. Dance!

Did you hear me?

I don't know what the hell you think you're doing. Dance!



Rita:

So watch the joy

Go on and on,

Like this crazy marathon



Mick:

Don't make me have to disqualify you.

(to the crowd)

Folks! Ain't she something, huh?



Rita:

At the truly uproarious.

Glamorous, glorious...



Mick:

I'm warning you! Dance. Damn you! Dance. Or you're out.



Rita:

Steel pier



Mick:

Did you hear me? Is that what you want?

You just want me to say it? Is that what you want?

Is that the game we're playing now? Fine, i'm gonna say it.

You're out. There. I said it. You're out. You hear me?

You're out.

You're out!! Out! Out! Out!

(into the microphone)

You're out! You're out!

Everybody dance!
