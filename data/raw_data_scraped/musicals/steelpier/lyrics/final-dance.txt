Final Dance


RITA:

Who are you...?



BILL:

Just a guy. Who wanted a second chance.



RITA:

Please, don't go.



BILL:

I only had three weeks. But you've got

a lifetime, Rita. Take a chance on it.



RITA:

Why did you come back?



BILL:

You still owe me a dance.

(He takes her in his arms quietly and they dance.

He kisses her, then pulls away.)



Go on. Fly.



(Bill watches Rita spin away and then leaves. The world of the marathon

returns, with couples dancing around her, it seems as if Rita won't be able to

escape the marathon. She struggles out of the Steel Pier with her suitcase and

finds a medal Bill won for bravery pinned to it as she triumphantly leaves the

Steel Pier.)
