Wet


Think of all the pleasure you'll get

When you're all wet

Not a trouble you can't forget

When you're all wet

Some folks say that being happy is

Having barrels of cash

But i believe that being happy is

Here a splash

There a splash



Let's get ready, set, and begin

To be all wet

Feel that water lapping your skin

When you're all wet

Come on, let's be a couple of sports

Show your nerve and show your shorts

There's no time for joking

This night could be smoking



Once we both get soaking

Wet



Come on! Take 'em off! All right, i won't look. I promise.



Bill:

Poppa never



Taught me to swim



So right now i'm



Fuming at him

Water games, well,



I've never been to them

But she could be

Talking me into them



If i sink and



Start to go down



In her arms,



A nice way to drown



All right here i go



Watch out down below



Both:

All the rules are broken

When the fire is smokin'

Douse it getting soakin' wet



Rita:

Think of all the pleasure

You'll get when you're

All wet



Not a trouble you can't forget

When you're

All wet

Some folks say that being

Happy is

Having barrels of cash

But i believe that being happy is

Here a splash, there a splash



Let's get ready set and begin

To get

All wet



Feel that water lapping your skin

When you're

All wet



Come on

Let's be a couple of sports

Show your nerve

And show your shorts



Both:

Come on get ready,

Then let's go

Plunge into that h-2-0

Nothing need be spoken

All taboos are broken

Once we two get soakin' wet



Why be feeling frantic

When you could be all romantic

Having fun in the atlantic

Getting soakin' wet?
