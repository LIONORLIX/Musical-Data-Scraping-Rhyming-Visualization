Two Little Words


Mick:

Ladies and gentlemen! This is the moment you've been waiting for.

The moment when a man and a woman make that sacred vow to be faithful forever!

And to start off this evening's ceremony on a high note, let's hear from a new

Discovery - fralinger's littte taffy miss - precious mcguire!



Precious:

Ah!



There are two little words

To lighten up your life

One word is husband

The other is wife



Two little words

To brighten any gloom

One word is bride

The other is groom



Precious:

You can curse the world

You can curse your fate

But you never can disparage

Marriage



And two other words

To tell you what bliss is

One word is mister the other is miss-is



So on the day he gives you the ring

If i were you i'd sing! Sing! Sing!

Ah!

Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!

Ha ha ha ha ha ha

Ah! Ah!



One little song

Keeps bubbling inside

Here comes the groom

Here comes the...

Bride



Thank you very much.



Mi mi mi mi mi mi mi mi mi mi mi

Mi mi mi mi mi mi mt mi ml mi mi

Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!

Ha ha ha ha ha

Mi m! Mi mi mi mi



Precious: company:

Precious

Company:

Mmm

Precious:

Ah!



Bill:

Precious: company:

Ah! Mmm



Rita:

Precious: company:

Preacher:

I now pronounce you man and wife.



Precious:

So on the day he gives you the ring

If i were you, i'd sing, sing sing...



Mick:

(as the wedding party poses for a picture):

Smile kids! Folks, this wedding has been sponsored by fralinger's!



All: precious:

Taffy kitchen by the shore

Ah!

Right by the shore

Ah!
