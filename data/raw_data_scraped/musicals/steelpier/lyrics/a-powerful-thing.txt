A Powerful Thing


Mick:

When i was a toddler

Daddy took the strap

And said, "i'm gonna teach you, son

How not to grow up like a sap"



And every time he whacked me

This message came across

Don't ever be an employee

Always be the boss



And, walker, can't you tell?

I learned my lesson well



When i say dance,

Watch 'em dance

When i say stop,

See them stop

When i say sing,

Hear them sing

Power is a wonderful thing





Mr. Walker:

Yes, boss, i agree

You certainly overpower me.



Mick:

When i say laugh,



Mick:

Hear 'em laugh

When i say weep,

Watch 'em weep

When i want noise,

Bells will ring.



Both:

Power is a beautiful thing:



Mick:

Take rita, for example,

She made all the magazines

'Cause when lindy landed home

From france

She kissed him first,

But not by chance

I staged that happy circumstance

The first of many brilliant routines



Mr. Walker:

Now i know what humility means



Mick:

So, if i smile, say hello

But if i'm bored, off you go

If i say jump, up you'll spring

'Cause i've got power



Mr. Walker:

You've got power



Mick:

Lots of power



Mr. Walker:

Tons of power



Both:

And power is a powerful thing.



Mick:

Take you, for example

You're an honest man...



Mr. Walker:

I guess



Mick:

But when i say lie



Mr. Walker:

I lie



Mick:

When i say cheat



Mr. Walker:

I cheat



Mick:

When i say steal



Mr. Walker:

I steal



Mick:

And what do you say?



Mr. Walker:

Yes!



Mick:

Say it again.



Mr. Walker:

Yes!



Mick:

Louder please!



Mr. Walker:

Yes ... Mick:

So here's the deal

Good old sport

I'm the star you support



Mick:

If i'm mad you'll feel my sting



Mr. Walker:

I'll kneel down and kiss your ring



Mick:

'Cause you're the subject

And i'm the king



Mr. Walker:

But power corrupts



Mick:

So, i'm corruptible



Mr. Walker:

Power destroys



Mick:

But i'm indestructible



Both:

It's a fact that

Power is a powerful thing!



Mick:

Walker, sit down.
