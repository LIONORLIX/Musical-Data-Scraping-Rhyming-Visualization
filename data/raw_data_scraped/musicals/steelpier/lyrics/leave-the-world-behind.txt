Leave The World Behind


(On a 15 minute rest break rita is sleeping on her cot.

Bill appears in her dreams in his aviator gear.)



Bill:

Come on!

Wake up!

It's time

To go

Up where the eagles fly



Where we can feel

The four winds blow

And watch the clouds roll by aviator angels:

Ahhh ahhh

When your earthly cares

Are a grind ahhh



Bill: aviator angels:

And you're left

With no peace

Of mind ahhh

Things work out

You're sure to find

When you leave when you leave

The world the world

You leave the world

Behind

Behind ahhh

Behind ahhh



(bill jumps up onto a busby berkeley dream plane,

Complete with chorine wingwalkers.)



Aviator angels:

Ahhh!

Ahhh!

Ahhh!



Come on and wake up, we're flying

The feeling's electrifying

Up where the eagles...

Just take a breath

It's death-defying

Just feel the four breezes blowing

No need to know where you're going

Watching the clouds roll...



Aviator angels:

Bye-bye, don't fret, it's better knowing

When your earthly cares are a grind

And you're still left with no

Peace of mind



That things will work out

You're sure to find

Up here looking down on all mankind

Here where the air is so refined

When you leave the world...





Bill:

(rita joins them on the plane, and as they fly through the sky,

The aviator angels tap dance on the wings, where they are joined

By rita. When the propeller stops during the dance, they grab on

To their safety-ropes for dear life, and rita almost falls.)



Bill:

Hold on rita! Hold on! Grab my hand! Don't look down! Come on rita,

Hold on! 1 got you!

(bill pulls rita back in and the aviator angels slowly tap the

Propeller into starting up again)



Women:

Ahhhh



(male wingwalkers appear on the plane.)



Men:

Ahhhh



Men: women:

Come on!

Come on!

Wake up!

Wake up!

It's time

It's time!

To go

We're going

All:

Up where the eagles fly

Up with the eagles

Men:

Where we

Where we

Can feel

Can feel



Men: women:

The four winds

Blow

The four winds blow

And watch the

Clouds roll by

And watch the clouds roll by



All:

Yes, watch the clouds roll

Gently

Gently by...

(the men carry the aviator angles off into

The sky leaving rita and bill behind)



Bill & rita:

When your earthly cares are a grind

And you're left with no peace of mind



(bill carries rita down from the plane and

Puts her carefully back onto her cot.)



Bill:

Fly and leave the world behind

Climb aboard and leave the

World behind

(bill kisses rita, and then disappears

Into the shadows as the dream ends.)



Scene: nighttime on the pier
