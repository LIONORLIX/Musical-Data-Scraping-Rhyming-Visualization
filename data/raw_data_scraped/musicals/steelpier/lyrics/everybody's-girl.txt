Everybody's Girl


Mick:

And now, sizzling shelby stevens!



Shelby

A long time ago

A lady whose name was carmen

Drove a man wild

Until he was out of control



I truly believe

That i am a modern day carmen

In spite of the fact

I do not habla espa?ol



Shelby

That girl was exactly like me

We share this philosophy

Ol?, i say



I'm not the type who's ready

For datin' someone steady

I'm everybody's girl



On sunday night it's danny

On monday maybe manny

I'm everybody's girl



There's a point to my behavior

Which is:

Smart girls always share their riches



So, if your heart succumbs

Don't let it

You're certain to regret it

All others, come and get it

I'm everybody's girl.



I could never be a cowhand's



La la la la la la



And you wanna know why?



All:

Why?



Shelby:

I just can't keep my calves together.



I'm everybody's girl

Some old greek called aristotle

Said it

If you got it, why not spread it?

So don't go rattling any sabres

Exerting any labors

Just share me with the neighbors

I'm everybody's girl



In case your passion rages,

I'm (n the yellow pages

I'm... Girl.





You won't be disappointed

I'm also double-jointed

I'm everybody's girl

Though it leaves a lot of fellas

Cursin'

I'm a person

Needs disbursin'



And so to reaffirm my status

It's absolutely gratis

To use my apparatus

I'm everybody's girl



Men and me are like pianos. When they

Get upright, i feel grand!



Everybody's girl!
