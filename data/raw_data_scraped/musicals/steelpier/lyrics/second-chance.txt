Bill:

Second chance.

Whoever gets to get a second chance?

Whoever gets another turn at bat?

Tell me that!



Rita:

Okay. Play time is over we're here to win.

Now follow me, and make a box.



Bill:

A box.



Rita:

This is the box step. Now look up. Keep making the box.

Oh, this is gonna be worse than i thought.



Bill:

One more try

Whoever gets to get another try?

Whoever gets to sing the big

Reprise?

Tell me, please



Rita:

Breathe!



Bill:

Once you're down

You're down, they say



Bill:

Once you're out,

You're out to stay

No one tells you

You can get right up

And you can start all over

With a second chance



Rita:

Watch this.



Bill:

Whenever life

Has gone rita:

From bad to worse, it's the promenade.

You've got to run

Your movie

In reverse

Re-rehearse

Soon that curse

Will disperse,

But first you've got to get

A second chance.

Quick, quick. Slow, slow. Good. Quick, quick.

It's my second chance.

Whoever gets to get another try?

Whoever gets to sing the big reprise?

Tell me please



Rita:

Not bad.



Bill:

Once you're down,

You're down, they say good.

Once you're out,

You're out to stay corner.

No one tells you

You can get right up

And you can start all over keep breathing

With a second chance that's it.

Whenever life has gone

From bad to worse, much better.

You've got to run your

Movie in reverse right!

Soon that curse uh-huh!

Will disperse,

But first you've got to get
