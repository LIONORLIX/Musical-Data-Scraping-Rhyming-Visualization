The Duel


ANATOLE

Good evening Pierre

Studying?



PIERRE

Yes. How was the opera?



ANATOLE

Lovely

Natalya Rostova was there



PIERRE

Oh, oh that charming young girl?

I have known her since she was a child

And long carried affection for her



ANATOLE

Yes, charming

Look, Dolokhov's coming round and we are off to the Club

Will you come old man?



PIERRE

I will come



ANATOLE

Lend me fifty rubles?



(Dolokhov arrives with many bottles of vodka)



DOLOKHOV

Drink drink

Gonna drink tonight

Gonna drink tonight

Gonna drink

Gonna drink

Gonna drink tonight

Gonna drink tonight

Gonna drink tonight

Gonna



DOLOKHOV, ANATOLE & PIERRE

Drink drink

Gonna drink tonight

Gonna drink tonight

Gonna

Gonna drink

Gonna drink tonight

Gonna drink tonight

Gonna drink tonight



(They drink and dance)



ALL

Drink with me my love

For there's fire in the sky

And there's ice on the ground

Either way my soul will die

Whoa....



PIERRE

The doctors warn me

That with my corpulence

Vodka and wine are dangerous for me



But I drink a great deal

Only quite at ease

After pouring several glasses

Mechanically into my large mouth



ALL

Then I feel

A pleasant warmth in my body,

A sentimental attachment to my fellow men



(Helene arrives and sidles up to Dolokhov.)



HELENE

Keep drinking old man



ANATOLE & DOLOKHOV

Keep drinking old man



HELENE, ANATOLE & DOLOKHOV

Drink the whole night through

Keep drinking old man



ALL

Keep drinking old man

Drink the whole night through

Keep drinking old man



(Pierre continues to drink, too much)



DOLOKHOV

Now Anatole,

What women tonight?

Moscow ladies

Or gypsy girls?

French actresses?



ANATOLE

Just no more unmarried heiresses!

So plain and boring



DOLOKHOV

And a little too dangerous eh?

Anatole is a married man

A fact known only to his intimates

A Polish landowner of some small means

Had forced him to marry his daughter



ANATOLE

Nevermind about that now,

It doesn't matter, I don't give a damn

Just as a duck is made to swim in water

God has made me as I am

All I care for is gaiety and women

And there's no dishonor in that

As long as there's money and vodka

I'll keep a feather in my hat



ALL

Whoa....



PIERRE

I used to love

I used to love

I used to be better



CHORUS

Keep drinking old man



HELENE

Yes drink drink drink

Drink drink drink

God, to think I married a man like you



PIERRE

Don't speak to me, wife

There is something inside me



HELENE

Dolokhov pour me another



PIERRE

Something terrible and monstrous



DOLOKHOV

Here's to the health of married women!

And a smile lurks at the corner of my mouth

Here's to the health of married women, and their lovers!



DOLOKHOV & CHORUS

Here's to the health of married women!

Here's to the health of married women, and their lovers!

Here's to the health of married women!

Here's to the health of married women, and their lovers!



PIERRE

How dare you touch her?



DOLOKHOV

You can't love her



PIERRE

Enough!

You bully, you scoundrel!

I challenge you!



DOLOKHOV

Oh, a duel!

Yes, this is what I like



HELENE

He will kill you!

Stupid husband!



PIERRE

So I shall be killed!

What is it to you!

Anatole, my guns



ANATOLE

Oh! This is horribly stupid



PIERRE

Just show me where to go

And tell me when to shoot



ANATOLE

Just wait till you're close enough

You'll never hit him from forty paces



DOLOKHOV

Well, let's begin!

This is child's play



SERVANT (DENISOV)

As the adversaries have refused a reconciliation, we shall please proceed with the duel

Ready your pistols, and on the count of tri, begin to advance



ALL

Rahz! Dva! Tri!



(They start towards each other.)



ANATOLE

Pierre, hold your fire

Pierre, hold your fire

Pierre, not yet!



(Pierre fires early; Dolokhov is hit)



DOLOKHOV

No!...

My turn



PIERRE

My turn



ANATOLE

Pierre, stand back!



(Pierre walks toward Dolokhov with his chest exposed. Dolokhov fires.)



DOLOKHOV

Missed

Missed

Oh my mother, my angel,

My adored angel mother!



HELENE

Take him away



(Anatole carries Dolokhov out.)



PIERRE

Missed

Missed

Such a storm of feelings



HELENE

You are a fool



(Pierre leaves. Anatole returns.)



ANATOLE

Natasha, Natasha

Her arms, her shoulders

Her neck, her feet



HELENE

The air of connoisseur



ANATOLE

I will make love to her



HELENE

And what will come of it?

She's first-rate, my dear, but she's not for you

You'd better wait till she's married



ANATOLE

You know, I adore little girls,

They lose their heads at once



Ask her to dinner, eh?

Sweet sister
