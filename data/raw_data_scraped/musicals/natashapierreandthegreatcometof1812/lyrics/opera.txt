Opera


MARYA D.

The opera, the opera!

Hold up your dresses and jump out quickly



SERVANT

Ladies

Welcome to the opera



SONYA

Bare arms and shoulders

Brilliant uniforms

Pearls and silk

Glittering before our eyes

Feminine envy

A whole crowd of memories

Desires and emotions

Natasha, smooth your gown



CHORUS

Natasha, smooth your gown



NATASHA

Looking in the glass

I see I am pretty

Not a girl anymore

I've never felt like this before



Hundreds of eyes

Looking at my bare arms

My bare arms and neck

My bare arms and shoulders



CHORUS

The two remarkably pretty girls

Had not been seen in Moscow in many years

Everybody knew vaguely of Natasha's engagement

One of the finest matches in all of Russia



SONYA

Look, there's Alexey, home from the war at last



MARYA D.

He has changed

Dear me, Michael Kirilovich has grown still stouter!



CHORUS

There's Boris and Julie, engaged

And Anna Mikhaylovna, what a headdress she has on!



HELENE

And is that Natasha



CHORUS

And is that Natasha

And is that Natasha



NATASHA

They are looking at me

They are talking about me!

They all like me so much

The women envious

The men calming their jealousy



SERVANT

Announcing Fedya Dolokhov

He dominates Moscow's most brilliant young men

He stands in full view

Well aware he's attracting attention

Yet as much as ease as though he were in his own room



MARYA D.

Dolokhov was in the Caucasus

And he killed the Shah's brother!

Now all the Moscow ladies are mad about him

Dolokhov the assassin!



SERVANT

Announcing Countess Helene Bezukhova

The queen of society

Beautiful, barely clothed

Plump bare shoulders, and much exposed neck

Round which she wears a double string of pearls



CHORUS

Helene and Dolokhov, arm in arm

Pierre the cuckold sits at home

Pierre the cuckold sits at home

The poor man



PIERRE

No, I am enjoying myself at home this evening



NATASHA

Oh, that neck

Oh, those pearls



HELENE

So beautiful

What a charming young girl

So enchanting



NATASHA

I blush scarlet



MARYA D.

Countess Bezukhova, Pierre's wife

Have you been here long?

And where is dear Pierre?

He never used to forget us



NATASHA

Yes Pierre, that good man

A little sad, a little stout

He must come visit us



HELENE

I will implore



MARYA D.

There's a woman one should stay far away from



Now Natasha

The curtain rises



CHORUS

The curtain rises



NATASHA

Everyone in the boxes and the stalls became silent

All the men, old and young, in uniform and evening dress

All the women in the hall

With gems on their bare flesh

Turned their whole attention

With curiosity to the stage



(Two singers perform a scene from an avant-garde opera. It is grotesque and amazing.)



NATASHA

Grotesque and amazing

I cannot follow the opera

Or even listen to the music

I see painted cardboard

Queerly dressed actors

Moving and singing so strangely in the lights

So false and unnatural

I'm ashamed and amused

And everyone else seems oblivious

Yes everyone feigns delight



SONYA

And feeling the flood of brilliant lights,

The warm perfumed air heated by the crowd,

Natasha little by little

Began to pass into a state of intoxication



(Natasha joins the singers in the opera.)



NATASHA

Oh I'd tickle you all if I could

Oh I'd tickle you all if I could



SONYA

And then

A rush of cold air



NATASHA & SONYA

An exceptionally handsome man walked in

With a confident yet courteous air



HELENE

This was Helene's brother

Anatole Kuragin

He moved with a swagger

Which would have been ridiculous

Had he not been so good-looking

And though it was the middle of the act

He walked right down the aisle

His sword and spurs jangling

His handsome perfumed head held high

And he looked right at Natasha



ANATOLE

Mais Charmante



HELENE

And he took his place in the front row next to Dolokhov



NATASHA

How handsome he is

How intoxicating



SONYA

In the second act there were tombstones

The moon over the footlights

Horns and contrabass

Black cloaks and daggers in their hands



NATASHA

I turn around again and our eyes meet

He gazes straight into my eyes

He is talking about me



SONYA

Candles burning

A crimson throne

The Tsar wails a mournful tune

They all wave their arms

And everybody cheers

?Bravo, bravo!?



NATASHA

Everytime I look at him

He's looking at me

Everytime I look at him

He's looking at me

Everytime I look at him



SONYA

A terrible noise, a clutter in the crowd

A storm of chromatic scales and diminished sevenths

With rapturous faces everyone was shouting

Screaming and shouting, ?Bravo!?



CHORUS

Bravo, bravo

Bravo, bravo

Bravo, bravo



SONYA

And then

A rush of cole air

And Anatole entered the box
