Letters


ALL

In nineteenth century Russia we write letters

We write letters

We put down in writing

What is happening in our minds



Once it's on the paper we feel better

We feel better

It's like some kind of clarity

When the letter's done and signed



PIERRE

Dear Andrey

Dear old friend

How goes the war?

Do we march on the French splendidly?

Do our cannons crack and cry?

Do our bullets whistle and sing?

Does the air reek with smoke?

I wish I were there

With death at my heels



Dolokhov is recovering

He will be all right, the good man

It should have been me

I am a most ridiculous man



And Natasha is in town

I hear she is more beautiful than ever

How I envy you and your happiness



Here at home

I drink and read and drink and read and drink

And I fill my mind with rot

While my heart is empty

And I've been studying the Cabal

And I've calculated the number of the beast

It is Napoleon

I will kill him one day

He is not a great man

None of us are great men

We are just caught in the wave of history

Nothing matters

Everything matters

It's all the same

If only I could not see it,

This dreadful, terrible it



ALL

In nineteenth century Russia we write letters

We write letters

We put down in writing

What is happening in our minds



NATASHA

Dear Andrey -



What more can I write

After all that has happened?

What am I to do if I love him and the other one too?

Must I break it off?

These terrible questions



NATASHA & PIERRE

I see nothing but the candle in the mirror

No visions of the future

So lost and alone



NATASHA

And what of Princess Mary



MARY

Dear Natasha

I am in deep despair at the misunderstanding there is between us

Whatever my father's feelings might be

I beg you to believe that I cannot help loving you

He's a tired old man and must be forgiven

Please, come see us again



NATASHA

Dear Princess Mary -



Oh what am I to write!

How do I choose

What do I do

I shall never be happy again



PIERRE

These terrible questions



MARY

I'm so alone here



NATASHA & PIERRE

So alone in here



MARY

And I see nothing



NATASHA, PIERRE & MARY

I see nothing but the candle in the mirror

No visions of the future

So lost and alone



ALL

In nineteenth century Russia we write letters

We write letters

We put down in writing

What is happening in our minds



ANATOLE

Dear Natalie

A love letter

A love letter

A love letter



NATASHA

A letter from him, from the man that I love



DOLOKHOV

A letter which I composed



ALL

A love letter

A love letter...



ANATOLE

Natalie Natalie Natalie

I must love you or die

Natalie Natalie Natalie

If you love me say yes

And I will come and steal you away

Steal you out of the dark

Natalie Natalie Natalie

I want nothing more



Natalie Natalie Natalie

I must love you or die

Natalie Natalie Natalie

If you love me say yes

And I will come and steal you away

Steal you out of the dark

Natalie Natalie Natalie

I want nothing more



Just say yes

Just say yes

Just say yes



NATASHA

Yes, yes, I love him!

How else could I have his letter in my hand?

I read it twenty times

Thirty times, forty times!

Each and every word

I love him, I love him



(Natasha sleeps. Sonya arrives and reads Anatole's letter.)
