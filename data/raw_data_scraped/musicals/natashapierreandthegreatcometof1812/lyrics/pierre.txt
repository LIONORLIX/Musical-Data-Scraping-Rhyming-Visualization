PIERRE

It's dawned on me suddenly

And for no obvious reason

That I can't go on

Living as I am



The zest of life has vanished

Only the skeleton remains

Unexpectedly vile

I used to be better



CHORUS

O Pierre! Our merry feasting crank

Our most dear, most kind, most smart and eccentric

A warm-hearted Russian of the old school

His purse is always empty

Cuz it's open to all

O Pierre

Just one of a hundred sad old men

Living out their final days in Moscow



PIERRE

I drank too much

Right now, my friend fights and bleeds

And I sit at home and read

Hours at a time

Hours at my screen

Anything, anything

Abandoned to distraction

In order to forget

We waste our lives

Drowning in wine



I never thought that I'd end up like this

I used to better



And the women they all pity me

Cuz I'm married

But not in love

Frozen at the center



WOMEN

Il est charmant; il n'a pas de sexe

He is charming; he has no sex



CHORUS

O Pierre! Our merry feasting crank

Our most dear, most kind, most smart and eccentric

A warm-hearted Russian of the old school

His purse is always empty

Cuz it's open to all

O Pierre

Just one of a hundred sad old men

Living out their final days in Moscow



PIERRE

There's a ringing in my head

There's a sickness in the world

And everyone knows

But pretends that they don't see

?Oh, I'll sort it out later?

But later never comes



PIERRE & MEN

And how many men before

Good Russian men

Believing in goodness and truth



PIERRE

Entered that door

With all their teeth and hair

And left it toothless and bald



You empty and stupid

Contented fellows

Satisfied with your place

I'm different from you

I'm different from you

I still want to do something



Or do you struggle too?

I pity you, I pity me, I pity you

I pity you, I pity me, I pity you



CHORUS

Ah...
