No One Else


NATASHA

The moon -

First time I heard your voice

Moonlight burst into the room

And I saw your eyes

And I saw your smile

And the world opened wide

And the world was inside of me



And I catch my breath

And I laugh and blush

And I hear guitars

You are so good for me



I love you I love you I love you I love you I love you



Oh the moon

Oh the snow in the moonlight

And your childlike eyes

And your distant smile

I'll never be this happy again

You and I

And no one else



We've done this all before

We were angels once

Don't you remember?

Joy and life

Inside our souls

And nobody knows

Just you and me

It's our secret



This winter sky

How can anyone sleep?

There was never such a night before!

I feel like putting my arms round my knees

And squeezing tight as possible

And flying away

Like this...



Oh the moon

Oh the snow in the moonlight

And your childlike eyes

And your distant smile

I'll never be this happy again

You and I

You and I

You and I

And no one else



Maybe he'll come today

Maybe he came already

And he's sitting in the drawing room

And I simply forgot
