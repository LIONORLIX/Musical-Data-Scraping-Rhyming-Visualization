Sonya Alone


SONYA

Hard as it is

In the coming days

I watch my friend

in her strange unnatural state ?

Don?t let her out of my sight ?

She trails off

Stares at nothing

Laughs at random

and the letters come



?She waits at the window

And I listen at the door



Until one day

I see by the sad look on her face ?

That there is a dreadful plan in her heart



I know you are capable of anything

I know you so well my friend ?

I know you might just run away

What am I to do???Who do I ask for help?

Is it all on me?

Is it all on me?



I will stand in the dark for you ?

I will hold you back by force ?

I will stand here right outside your door ?

I won?t see you disgraced ?

I will protect your name and your heart ?

Because I miss my friend



I know you?ve forgotten me ?

I know you so well my friend ?

I know you might just throw yourself over ?

But I won?t let you

I won?t let you

It?s all on me



I remember this family

I remember your kindness

And if I never sleep again??I will stand in the dark for you ?

I will hold you back by force ?

I will stand here right outside your door

I won?t see you disgraced ?

I will protect your name and your heart ?

Because I miss my friend

Because ?I miss my friend

Because I miss you, my friend
