Natasha & Anatole


ANATOLE

I have long wished to have this happiness

Ever since the Naryshkins' ball

Where I had the well-remembered pleasure of seeing you

How do you like the performance?

Last week Semenova fell down on the stage



NATASHA

He is sensible and simple

Bold and natural,

So strange and agreeable

There is nothing formidable

His smile is most na√Øve,

Cheerful and good-natured

And he's as handsome up close as at a distance

And he's as handsome up close as at a distance



ANATOLE

And do you know, Natasha

We are having a costume tournament soon

You ought to come, please come!



NATASHA

Oh -



ANATOLE

You ought to come, please come!



NATASHA

Oh I -



ANATOLE

And I never remove my smiling eyes

From your face, your neck, your bare arms

And I never remove my smiling eyes

From your face, your neck, your bare arms



NATASHA

I know for certain that he is taken by me

I know for certain that he is enraptured by me

I feel him looking at my shoulders

My face, my neck, my bare arms



ANATOLE

And I look you in the eye



NATASHA & ANATOLE

And I look you in the eye



NATASHA

And looking into his eyes

I am frightened

There's not that barrier of modesty

I've always felt with men

I feel so terribly near

I fear that he may seize me from behind

And kiss me on the neck



How do you like Moscow?



ANATOLE

At first I did not like it much

Because what makes a town pleasant

Ce sont les jolies femmes

Isn't that so?

But now I like it very much indeed

Do come to the costume tournament Countess,

Do come!

You will be the prettiest there

You will be the prettiest there

Do come, dear Countess, and give me this flower as a pledge



We are speaking of most ordinary things



NATASHA

Yet I feel closer to you than I've ever felt with any other man

No one else is here

No one else can see us

Your eyes

Your eyes

Your eyes

Oh your eyes



ANATOLE

It's all right, Natasha, I'm here

It's all right, Natasha, I'm here



NATASHA

And I -

I cannot speak



NATASHA & ANATOLE

Look straight into my eyes

Nearness

Tenderness

Smile at me

Gaze straight into my eyes

There is no barrier between us

There is nothing between us

Nothing between us



(Anatole leaves)
