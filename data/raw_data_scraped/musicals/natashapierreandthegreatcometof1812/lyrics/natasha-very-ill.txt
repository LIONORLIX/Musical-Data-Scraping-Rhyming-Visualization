Natasha Very Ill


SONYA

Natasha very ill

The whole house

A state of alarm and commotion

Natasha very ill

Having poisoned herself

With a bit of arsenic

She woke me in the middle of the night

And told me what she had done

And the doctors

And the antidotes

And now she is out of danger

But still so weak

And Andrey is to return

We wait with dread
