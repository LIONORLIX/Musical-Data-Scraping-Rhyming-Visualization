The Great Comet of 1812


PIERRE

Where to now?

Where can I go now?

Not to the Club

Not to pay calls



Mankind seems so pitiful

So poor

Compared to that softened, grateful, last glance

She gave me through her tears



CHORUS

It was clear and cold

About the dirty streets

Above the black roofs

Stretched the dark starry sky



PIERRE

This vast firmament

Open to my eyes

Wet with tears



CHORUS

And there in the middle

Above Prechistensky Boulevard

Surrounded and sprinkled on all sides by stars

Shines the Great Comet of 1812

The Brilliant Comet of 1812



PIERRE

The comet said to portend

Untold horrors

And the end of the world



But for me

The comet brings no fear

No, I gaze joyfully



And this bright star

Having traced its parabola

With inexpressible speed

Through immeasurable space

Seems suddenly

To have stopped

Like an arrow piercing the earth

Stopped for me



It seems to me

That this comet

Feels me

Feels my softened and uplifted soul

And my newly melted heart

Now blossoming

Into a new life
