Sonya & Natasha


SONYA

How was it I noticed nothing?

How could it go so far?

It can't be that she loves him

It can't be

Natasha



(Natasha awakes and sees Sonya)



NATASHA

Sonya, you're back

And with the tender resolve that often comes at the moment of awakening

I embraced my friend

But noticing Sonya's look of embarrassment

My face expressed confusion

And suspicion



Sonya, you've read the letter?



SONYA

Yes



NATASHA

Oh Sonya, I'm glad,

I can't hide it any longer!

Now you know, we love one another!

Oh Sonya, he writes, he writes

He writes, he writes, he writes



SONYA

And Andrey?



NATASHA

Oh Sonya, if you only knew how happy I am!

You don't know what love is



SONYA

But Natasha, can that all be over?



NATASHA

I do not grasp the question



SONYA

Are you refusing Prince Andrey?



NATASHA

Oh, you don't understand anything!

Don't talk nonsense, just listen



SONYA

But I can't believe it, I don't understand

How you loved one man a whole year

And suddenly -

You've only known him three days!

Natasha, you're joking!



NATASHA

Three days?

It seems to me I've loved him a hundred years

It seems to me that I've never loved anyone before

Sonya, wait a bit, sit here



I had heard that it happens like this

And you must have heard it too

But it's only now

That I feel such love

It's not the same as before

He's my master and I am his slave

What can I do?

Sonya, what can I do?

I'm so happy

And so frightened

Why can't you understand?

I love him!



SONYA

Then I won't let it come to that, I shall tell!

Bursting into tears



NATASHA

What do you mean?

For God's sake, if you tell, you are my enemy!

You want me to be miserable

You want to tear us apart

For God's sake, Sonya, don't tell anyone, don't torture me

I have confided in you



SONYA

What has happened between you?

What has he said to you?

Why doesn't he come to the house and openly ask for you hand?

Why this secrecy?

Have you thought what his secret reasons may be?



NATASHA

I don't know what the reasons are

But there must be reasons!

Sonya, one can't doubt him!

One can't, one can't! Don't you understand?



SONYA

Does he love you?



NATASHA

Does he love me?

Why, you've read his letter, you've seen him

I can't live without him



SONYA

Natasha, think of our family

And think of Prince Andrey



NATASHA

Andrey said I was free to refuse him



SONYA

But you haven't refused him, or have you?



NATASHA

Perhaps I have

Perhaps all is over between me and Bolkonsky

Would you think so badly of me?



SONYA

I won't succumb to your tender tone Natasha

I don't trust him, Natasha!

I'm afraid for you, Natasha!

Afraid you are going to your ruin



NATASHA

Then I'll go to my ruin, yes I will, as soon as possible!

But it's not your business!

It won't be you, it'll be me, who'll suffer

Leave me alone, yes leave me alone!

I hate you Sonya!

I hate you Sonya!

I hate you, I hate you!

You're my enemy forever!



SONYA

I burst into sobs



(Natasha runs out of the room)



NATASHA

And without a moment's reflection

I wrote the answer to Princess Mary

I'd been unable to write all morning



All our misunderstandings are at an end

Forget everything and forgive me

But I can't be Andrey's wife
