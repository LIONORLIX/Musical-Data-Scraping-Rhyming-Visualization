A Call to Pierre


(A servant hands a letter to Pierre)



SERVANT

A letter from Marya Dmitryevna asking you to come and visit her

On a matter of great importance

Relating to Andrey Bolkonsky and his betrothed



PIERRE

What?

What can they want with me?



(He arrives at Marya D.'s)



MARYA D.

Pierre, old friend I'm sorry it's late

I'm sorry I haven't seen you about

Where have you been?

Where have you been?



PIERRE

I have been studying



MARYA D.

Pierre old friend we need your help

Pierre old friend the family name

We need your help

We need your help

There's ruin at the door



PIERRE

Marya?



MARYA D.

Natasha has let down the family



PIERRE

What?



MARYA D.

Natasha has broken with Andrey



PIERRE

Natasha has tried to elope



PIERRE

What?



MARYA D.

Natasha and Antole Kuragin!



PIERRE

What?



MARYA D.

We need your help

We need your help

There's ruin at the door



PIERRE

Natasha, that charming girl?

I can't believe my ears

So I am not the only man

Tied to a bad woman

And Anatole, that stupid child

They'll lock him up for years

For Anatole is a married man!



MARYA D.

Married? He's married?



PIERRE

Yes



MARYA D.

Oh wait till I tell her



PIERRE

Poor Andrey



MARYA D.

And when Andrey comes home

He will challenge Anatole to a duel

And get himself killed

And all will be ruined



You must go see your brother-in-law

And tell him that he must leave Moscow

And not dare to let me set my eyes on him again



PIERRE

At once
