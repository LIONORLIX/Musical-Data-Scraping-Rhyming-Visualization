No More Candy


AMALIA:

We become indiscreet

Eating sweet after sweet,

Though we know very well where that may lead.

So this box was designed

With the two of us in mind

As the kind of reminder we need.

When you lift the lid, the music plays

Like a disapproving nod.

And it sings in your ear:

"No more candy, my dear!"

In a way, it's a little like the voice of God.
