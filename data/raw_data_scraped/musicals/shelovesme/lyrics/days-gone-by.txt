Days Gone By


MARACZEK:

Young, strong...oh, I was something in days gone by.

With some girl who'd just happened to catch my eye.

Slim, straight, light on my feet,

Shoes just skimming the ground,

One-two-three, one-two-three, follow the beat

Around, around, around.

All night circling the floor

Till dawn lit up the sky...

No one's younger than I

In days gone by.
