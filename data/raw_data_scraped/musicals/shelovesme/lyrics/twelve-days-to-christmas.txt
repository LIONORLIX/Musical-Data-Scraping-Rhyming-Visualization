Twelve Days To Christmas


Ensemble:

On the first day of Christmas my true love gave to me. Ooh..



Amalia: Good morning, Mr. Novak.

Georg: Good morning, Ms. Balish. How are you today?

Amalia: Oh, I'm ready for thousands of customers.

Georg: Well, only twelve days to go!



Ensemble/Customers:



Fa la la la la la la la

Fa la la la la la la

Fa la la la



Twelve days to Christmas,

Twelve days to Christmas,

Plenty of time to do your Christmas shopping

These are the people who shop in time, shop in time, plenty of time

These are the people with time to spare who shop at their convenience



Twelve days to Christmas,

Twelve days to Christmas,

Look at the way they do their Christmas shopping

They can go shopping and still remain calm and sedate

These are the people we envy and the people that we hate!



Thank you, Thank you

We'll call again

We'll call again, thank you



Amalia: Quite a day, eh, Mr. Novak?

Georg: It certainly was, Ms. Balish.

Amalia: Oh thank you for the book, it was excellent.

Georg: Oh, I'm glad you enjoyed it.

Will you be taking the bus home today, Ms. Balish.

Amalia: Yes, I will.

Gerog: May I walk you to the bus stop?

Amalia: Oh, I'd like that Mr. Novak, thank you.



Ensemble/Customers:

Twelve drummers drumming,

Twelve drummers drumming

Eleven pipers piping,

Eleven pipers piping

Ten lords a leaping

Nine



Nine days to Christmas,

Nine days to Christmas

Still enough time to do your Christmas shopping

These are the people who shop in time, shop in time, still enough time

Sensible people who organize the time at their disposal

Nine days to Christmas,

Nine days to Christmas,

Still enough time to do your Christmas shopping

These are the people who plan their days wisely and well

These are the people who shop in time, and they can go to hell!

Cashiers: Thank you, thank you, please call again, do call again, thank you



Customers: Thank you, thank you, we'll call again, we'll call again, thank you



Georg: Are you in a very great hurry today, Ms. Balish?

Amalia: No

Georg: Well, I thought, maybe a cup of coffee on the way to the bus?

Amalia: I'd love that



Ensemble/Customers:

Eight maids a milking

Seven swans a swimming

Six geese a laying

Five golden rings



Four days to Christmas

Four days to Christmas

Just enough time to do your Christmas shopping

These are the people who shop in time, just in time, barely in time

These are the people who calculate with clinical precision

Four days to Christmas

Four days to Christmas

These are the folks who never waste a second

Full of a chilly efficiency

Loaded with gall

Never too early and never late

AND THEY'RE THE WORST OF ALL!



(Simultaneously)



Cashiers: Thank you, thank you, please call again, do call again, thank you



Customers: Thank you, thank you, we'll call again, we'll call again, thank you



Amalia: What a day!

Georg: Ah! Just wait until the twenty fourth.



Ensemble/Customers:

THE TWENTY FOURTH?!

One day to Christmas

One day to Christmas

Not enough time to do our Christmas shopping

We're not the shopple who peeped in time

We're not the sheeple who popped in time

We're not the people who shopped in time

Shopped in time, not enough time

We are the people who always wait until it's much too late, OH!



One day to Christmas

One day to Christmas

How will we ever do our Christmas shopping?

Why did we ever delay so long, who can recall?

Some of the family may not get a Christmas gift at all!



(Simultaneously)



Cashiers: Thank you, thank you, please call again, do call again, thank you



Customers: Thank you, thank you, we'll call again, we'll call again, thank you



Merry Christmas!
