Ilona


Come with me, ilona

I've missed you so much.

How I envy you each evening

when work is through

For I have only me to be with

While you have you.

Ilona



How cold my lonely life has grown

Are you happy alone

Ilona, Ilona

My own



Come with me, Ilona

Come with me, cherie.

Mistletoe I long for someone

Please tell me who

Like some divine divining rod

It points straight to you.

Ilona



The sunny nights we knew before.

If you'll just say the word

Ilona

We'll know them

Once more.
