Grand Knowing You


[Kodaly]

It's been grand knowing you

Grand knowing you

Grand being your friend.

You've been kind, loyal, and so generous

Right down to the end.

Please don't grieve watching me leave

That would be much too painful to stand.

It's been fun

Now I must run

But it's been grand, perfectly grand!



Ilona, farewell cherie, be brave.

Chin up, it's been sublime.

You mustn't waste a precious moment over me.

You don't have time.

Just remember if you lonely or blue,

There's a hollow in my pillow for you.



And Sipos, what can I say?

Ah, Sipos.

No tears be gay, you know old friend

I'm in your debt.

I owe you more than I can possibly repay.

I won't forget.

Give your wife a little kiss from Kodaly.

I've never met her, but I will

By and by.



Though I hate leaving you,

Hate leaving your warm intimate club.

It's a small pleasure but I'll treasure

Each warm intimate snub.

It's been grand let me say

And let me say "Au revoir" not goodbye

For it's grand knowing you'll all be working

For your friend,

Kodaly!
