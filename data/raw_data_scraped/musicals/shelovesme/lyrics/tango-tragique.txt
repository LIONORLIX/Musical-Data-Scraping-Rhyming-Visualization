Tango Tragique


Georg:

I'll tell you of a lonely girl I knew.

Her story, I fear, is tragic to hear.

Nevertheless, it's true.

Her downfall as I now recall began

When her lonely heart's club found her a lonely man.

She sat down and wrote. He answered her note. And now there was no retreat.

Then one autumn day, she called me to say, they felt it was time to meet.

She told him to wear a rose boutanier, so she knew that he was he.

And he was to look for one certain book, inside which a rose would be.

From that day she was never seen around.

We searched high and low, but search as we would, only a trace was found.

Her left leg floating in a local brook.

We never could find the rest of her, or her book!
