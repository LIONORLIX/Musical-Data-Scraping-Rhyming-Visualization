Three Letters


GEORG:

Dear friend:

When the day brings petty aggravations

And my poor frayed nerves are all askew,

I forget these unimportant matters

Pouring out my hopes and dreams to you.

As I sit here looking out my window,

I can see the summer disappear.

Oh, dear friend, all at once, autumn's here!



Dear friend:

With November just around the corner,

I've a feeling you may also share:

Do you feel an undertone of discord

And a sense of tension in the air?

If it weren't for your endearing letters,

I'd be flying south with all the geese!

By the way, have you read "War and Peace?"



Dear friend:

Have you set your calendar for Tuesday,

When we bring this...



AMALIA (reading) & GEORG (writing):

...chapter to a close?

When I meet my lady of the letters

Who puts tiny faces in her O's?

In the freezing weather of December

I'll be warmly waiting for our date.



AMALIA (reading):

Until then, count the hours--

Oh my lord, I'm late!

I'm late for work!
