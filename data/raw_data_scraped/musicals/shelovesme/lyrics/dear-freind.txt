Dear Freind


The flowers, the linen, the crystal I see

Were carefully chosen for people like me.

The silver agleam and the candles aglow...your favorite songs on request.



Each colorful touch in the finest of taste,

and notice how subtly the tables are spaced.

The music is muted, the lighting is low; no wonder I feel so depressed.



Charming, romantic, the perfect cafe

Then as if it isn't bad enough a violin starts to play

Candles and wine, tables for two, but where are you dear friend?



Couples go past me, I see how they look.

So discreetly sympathetic when they see the rose and the book.

I make believe nothing is wrong, how long can I pretend?

Please make it right, don't break my heart, don't let it end, dear friend.
