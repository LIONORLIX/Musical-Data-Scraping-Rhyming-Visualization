Vanilla Ice Cream


Amalia:

(spoken) Dear Friend



(sung)I am so sorry about last night

It was a nightmare in every way

But together you and I

Will laugh at last night some day



Ice Cream

He brought me Ice Cream

Vanilla Ice Cream

Imagine that



Ice Cream

And for the first time

We were together

Without a spat



Friendly

He was so friendly

That isn't like him

I'm simply stunned



Will wonders never cease

Will wonders never cease

It's been a most peculiar day

Will wonders never cease

Will wonders never cease



(spoken) Oh yes, where was I..



(sung) I am so sorry about last night

It was a nightmare in everyway

But together you and I

Will laugh at last night some day

I sat there waiting at that cafe

And never guessing that you were fat

...that you were near

You were outside looking bald

(spoken) Oh dear..

(sung) I am so sorry about last night



Last Night

I was so nasty

Well he deserved it

But even so



That Georg

Is not like this Georg

This is a new Georg

I just don't know



Somehow

It all reminds me

Of Dr. Jekyll

And Mr. Hyde



Well right before my eyes

A man that I dispise

Has turned into a man I like

It's almost like a dream

And strange at it may seem

He came to offer me

Vanilla Ice Cream
