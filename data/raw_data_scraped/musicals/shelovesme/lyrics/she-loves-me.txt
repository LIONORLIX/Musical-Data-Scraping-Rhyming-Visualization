She Loves Me


Well! Well! Well! Well! Well!

Well! Well! Well! Well! Well!

Will wonders never cease?

I didn't like her!

I didn't like her!

I couldn't stand her

I couldn't stand her!

I wouldn't have her!

I never knew her,

But now I do!

And I could...

And I would...

And I know...



She loves me

And to my amazement

I love it knowing that she loves me

She loves me,

True, she doesn't show it

How could she,

When she doesn't know it.

Yesterday she loathed me, bah!

Now today she likes me, ah!

And tomorrow, tomorrow...

AAAAAAAAAAAh!



My teeth ache from the urge to touch her

I'm speechless for I mustn't tell her

It's wrong now, but it won't be long now

Before my love discovers

That she and I are lovers

Imagine how surprised she's bound to be,

She loves meeeeeeeeeee!



I love her, isn't that a wonder?

I wonder why I didn't want her.

I want her, that's the thing that matters,

And matters are improving daily.



Yesterday I loathed her, bah!

Now today I love her, ah!

And tomorrow, tomorrow...

AAAAAAAAAAAh!



I'm tingling, such delicious tingles,

I'm trembling, what the hell does that mean?

I'm freezing that's because it's cold out.

But still I'm incandescent

And like some adolescent

I'd like to scrawl on ev'ry wall I see

She loves me!

She loves meeeeeeeee!
