Romantic Atomsphere


Waiter:  (Sung) Butterfingers do that again that's the end of your career!



(Spoken) How do you do sir?  How do you do madam?



(Sung) Don't you know we try to preserve a romantic atmosphere?



(Spoken) It's good to see you again Mr. List!



(Sung)

That's what all our patrons expect,

so every jarring note will be ruthlessly checked.

Gently does it, try to preserve a romantic at-mosphere!



Think of all the love affairs we assist!

What more noble calling is there than ours?

Tending each new beautiful bud of love,

making sure each delicate seedling flowers.



Treat each trist and rondevouz as your own,

bearing in mind the gravity of your task.

All these lovers want is one shining hour,

is that such a terrible lot to ask?



Look around you, see for yourself!  The romantic atmosphere.



(Patrons) Victor!  Stephanie!



(Waiter) That's what all our patrons demand,

that's the reason why they're here!



(Patrons) Victor!  HUGO?!?!



(Waiter)

They all come here just for the mood

(and if you don't believe me try tasting our food!)

That's why we have got to preserve a romantic atmosphere!



(Tango interlude)



SUCH BEHAVIOR WON'T BE ALLOWED!

...but every now and then we just get the wrong crowd.

Gently does it, try to preserve a romantic atmosphere!
