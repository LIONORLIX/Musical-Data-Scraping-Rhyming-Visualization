Good Morning, Good Day


ARPAD:

Good morning!



SIPOS:

Good day!



ARPAD:

How are you this beautiful day?

Isn't this a beautiful morning?



SIPOS:

Very!



ARPAD:

Hey, Sipos, how's this?...



SIPOS:

That's a very elegant pose,

But is all that elegance necessary?



ARPAD (speaking): And why not? I represent Maraczek, don't I?

We're not a butchershop or a hardware store--we're a parfumerie!

And that means we're...we're...



SIPOS (singing):

We're stylish.



ARPAD:

That's it!



SIPOS:

With a quiet dignity.



ARPAD:

Yes, and we get the tilt of our hats right.



SIPOS:

That's right!



ARPAD:

When I ride my bike,

People see what Maraczek's like,

So I think it's very important that I look my best.



[ILONA enters.]



ILONA:

Good morning!



SIPOS & ARPAD:

Good day!



ILONA:

How are you this glorious day?

Have you seen a lovelier morning?



SIPOS & ARPAD:

Never!



ILONA:

It's too nice a day to be inside shuffling soap;

I have no more energy whatsoever.



[KODALY enters]



KODALY:

Good morning!



SIPOS, ARPAD & ILONA

Good day!



KODALY:

How are you this radiant day?

What a rare magnificent morning!



SIPOS & ARPAD:

Is it?



KODALY (to ILONA):

Good morning, my dear! How are you this ravishing day?

Do you know, you've never looked more exquisite.



ILONA:

Thank you, kind sir.



KODALY (speaking): What a lovely dress!



ARPAD: It's the same one she had on yesterday, Mr. Kodaly.



[GEORG enters]



GEORG (singing):

Good morning!



THE OTHERS:

Good day!



GEORG:

Isn't that a beautiful sky?

What a perfect sample of summer weather!

It's too nice a day to be indoors counting out change.

What a waste of holiday weather!

All together,

Let's all run away.



ILONA:

Wouldn't it be something if we all took off from work?



SIPOS:

Leaving Mr. Maraczek without a single clerk!



ARPAD:

Why not have a picnic?



SIPOS:

I could bring my wife's preserves.



KODALY:

Champagne might be nice with hot hors d'oeuvres!



ALL:

It's too nice a day to be stuck inside of a store.

We could all be getting our summer suntan!

It's so nice a day to be dozing under a tree--



SIPOS:

And we'll all be out of a job--



ILONA:

If it costs that much to get suntanned--



SIPOS:

I'll stay untanned.



KODALY:

Pale, but solvent.



ALL:

A picnic--a picnic--

Oh, well.
