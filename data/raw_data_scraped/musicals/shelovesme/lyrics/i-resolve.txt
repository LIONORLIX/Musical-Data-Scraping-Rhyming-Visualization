I Resolve


ILONA:

I resolve not to be so stupid,

I resolve not to play these games,

How often I've been a sitting duck for cupid,

How often I've let him shoot me down in flames,



I resolve not to be so trusting,

It's high time, time that I awoke,

Whatever I've got up here is up here rusting,

My feminine intuition is a joke,



I must be cousin to a cat,

I always wind up with a rat,

I'm through with momentary thrills,

I find I can't afford the bills!



I resolve,

Come what may,

I will not be this girl one more day,



I resolve not be so brainless,

I resolve not to be so dumb,

My usual brush with love is far from painless,

And suddenly I have got to know how come,



I resolve not to blame the others,

Just because I'm an easy mark,

I wanna know why I never meet their mothers,

Where men are concerned I'm always in the dark,



I must stop thinking with my skin,

I will not be a mandolin,

That someone strums and puts away,

Until he gets the urge to play,



I resolve,

Here and Now,

I will be a different girl,

Somehow.
