Fugue for the Tinhorns


NICELY

I got the horse right here

The name is Paul Revere

And here's a guy that says that the weather's clear

Can do, can do, this guy says the horse can do

If he says the horse can do, can do, can do.



(Benny starts singing his part at this time, while Nicely continues:)

Can do - can do - this guy says the horse can do

If he says the horse can do - can do, can do.



(Rusty starts singing his part as the time, while Nicely and Benny continue:)

For Paul Revere I'll bite

I hear his foot's all right

Of course it all depends if it rained last night



Likes mud, likes mud, this X means the horse likes mud

If that means the horse likes mud, likes mud

Likes mud.



I tell you Paul Revere

Now this is no bum steer

It's from a handicapper that's real sincere

Can do, can do, this guy says the horse can do.

If he says the horse can do - can do - can do.

Paul Revere. I got the horse right here.



BENNY

I'm pickin' Valentine, 'cause on the morning line

A guy has got him figured at five to nine

Has chance, has chance, this guy says the horse has chance

if he says the horse has chance, has chance, has chance



I know it's Valentine, the morning work looks fine

Besides the jockey's brother's a friend of mine

Needs race, needs race, this guy says the horse needs race

If he says the horse needs race, needs race, needs race.

I go for Valentine, 'Cause on the morning line,

The guy has got him figured at five to nine

Has chance, has chance, this guy says the horse has chance

Valentine! I got the horse right here.



RUSTY CHARLIE

But look at Epitaph. he wins it by a half

According to this here in the Telegraph

"Big Threat" - "Big Threat"

This guy calls the horse "Big Threat"

If he calls the horse "Big Threat",

Big Threat, Big Threat.



And just a minute, boys.

I've got the feed box noise

It says the great-grandfather was Equipoise

Shows class, shows class.

This guy says the horse shows class

If he says the horse shows class

Shows class, show's class.



So make it Epitaph, he wins it by a half

According to this here in the Telegraph.

Epitaph! I got the hore right here!
