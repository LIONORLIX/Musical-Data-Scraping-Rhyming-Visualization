Follow the Fold


Follow the fold and stray no more

Stray no more, stray no more.

Put down the bottle and we'll say no more

Follow, follow, the fold.

Before you take another swallow!

Follow the fold and stray no more

Stray no more, stray no more.

Tear up your poker deck and play no more.

Follow, follow, the fold.



To the meadows, where the sun shines

Out of the darkness

And the cold.

And the pain and shame in which you wallow.

Follow the fold and stray no more

Stray no more, stray no more.

If you're a sinner and you pray no more

Follow, follow, the fold.
