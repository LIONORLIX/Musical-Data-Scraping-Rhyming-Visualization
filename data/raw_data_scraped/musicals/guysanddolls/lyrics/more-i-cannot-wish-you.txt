More I Cannot Wish You


Velvet I can wish you

For the collar of your coat

And fortune smiling all along your way

But More I Cannot Wish You

Than to wish you find your love

Your own true love this day



Mansions I can wish you

Seven footmen all in red

And calling cards upon a silver tray.

But More I Cannot Wish You

Than to wish you find your love

Your own true love this day



Standing there

Gazing at you

Full of the bloom of youth



Standing there

Gazing at you

With a sheep's eye

And a licorice tooth.



Music I can wish you

Merry music while you're young

And wisdom when your hair has turned to gray.

But More I Cannot Wish You

Than to wish you find your love

Your own true love this day

With a sheep's eye

And a licorice tooth

And a strong arms

To carry you away.
