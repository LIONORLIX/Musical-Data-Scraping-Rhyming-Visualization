Finale


When you see a guy reach for stars in the sky

You can bet that he's doing it for some dolls

When you spot a John waiting out in the rain

Chances are he's insane as only a John can be for a Jane.



When you meet a gent paying all kinds of rent

For a flat that could flatten the Taj Mahal.

Call it sad, call it funny

But it's better than even money

That the guys only doing it for some doll.
