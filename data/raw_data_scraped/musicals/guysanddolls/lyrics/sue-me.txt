Sue Me


You promise me this, you promise me that

You promise me anything under the sun

Then you give me a kiss,

And your grabbing your hat

And your off to the races again

When I think of the time gone by



Adelaide, Adelaide!



And I think of the way I tried!



Adelaide!



I could honestly die.



Call a lawyer and sue me,

Sue me

What can you do me,

I love you.

Give a holler and hate me

Hate me

Go ahead, hate me!

I LOVE YOU



The best years of my life, I was a fool to give you you



Alright, already, I'm just a no-goodnick!

Alright, already, it's true.

So new.

So sue me, sue me

What can you do me?

I love you



You gamble it here,

You gamble it there

You gamble on everything, all except me

And I'm sick of you keeping me up in the air

Till your back in the money again

When I think of the time gone by



Adelaide, Adelaide!



And I think of the way I tried!



Adelaide!



I could honestly die.



Serve a paper and sue me, sue me

What can you do me,

I love you.

Give a holler and hate me,

Hate me,

Go ahead, hate me!



When you wind up in jail

Don't come to me to bail you out!



Alright, already, so call a policeman!

Alright, already, it's true

So new

So sue me, sue me

What can you do me

I love you!



You're at it again,

You're running the game

I'm not gonna play second fiddle to that.

And I'm telling you now that we're through!

When I think of the time gone by



Adelaide, Adelaide!



And I think of the way I tried!



Adelaide!



I could honestly die.



Sue me, sue me

Shoot bullets through me

I love you!!
