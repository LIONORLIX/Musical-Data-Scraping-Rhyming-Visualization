My Time of Day


My time of day is the dark time

A couple of deals before dawn

When the street belongs to the cop

And the janitor with the mop

And the grocery clerks are all gone.



When the smell of the rainwashed pavement

Comes up clean, and fresh, and cold

And the streetlamp light

Fills the gutter with gold



That's my time of day

My time of day



And you're the only doll I've ever wanted to share it with me.
