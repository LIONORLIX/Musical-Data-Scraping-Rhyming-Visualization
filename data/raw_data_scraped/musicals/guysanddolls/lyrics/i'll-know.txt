I'll Know


For I've imagined every bit of him

To the strong moral fiber to the wisdom in his head

To the home-y aroma of his pipe

You have wished yourself a Scarsdale Galahad

The breakfast-eating, Brooks-brothers type.

Yes, and I shall meet him when the time is right.



SKY. (spoken) You've got the guy all figured out.

SARAH (spoken) I have.

SKY (spoken) Including what he smokes. All figured out, huh?

SARAH (spoken) All figured out.



I'll know when my love comes along

I won't take a change.

I'll know he'll be just what I need

Not some fly-by-night Broadway romance.

And you'll know at a glance by the two-pair of pants.

I'll know by the calm steady voice

Those feet on the ground.

I'll know as I run to his arms

That at last I've come home safe and sound.

Until then, I shall wait.

Until then, I'll be strong.

Oh, I'll know, when my love comes along.



SKY. (spoken) No, no, no! You are talking about love! You can't dope it like that. What

are you picking, a guy or a horse?

SARAH (spoken) I wouldn't expect a gambler to understand.

SKY (spoken) Would you like to hear how a gambler feels about the big heart throb?

SARAH (spoken) No!

SKY (spoken) Well, I'll tell you.



Mine will come as a surprise to me.

Mine I lead to chance and chemistry.



SARAH (spoken) Chemistry?

SKY (spoken) Yeah, chemistry.



Suddenly I'll know when my love comes along

I'll know then and there

I'll know at the sight of her face

How I care, how I care, how I care

And I'll stop. And I'll stare.



And I'll know long before we can speak

I'll know in my heart.

I'll know and I won't ever ask

Am I right, am I wise, am I smart.

And I'll stop. And I'll stare.

At that face. In the throng.

Yes, I'll know when my love comes along

I'll know

When my love comes along.



I'll know. I won't take a chance.

I know he'll be just what I need

Not some fly-by-night Broadway romance.

Until then, I shall wait.

And till then, I'll be strong.

Oh, I'll know when my love comes along.
