Bushel and a Peck


I love you, a bushel and a peck!

A bushel and a peck, and a hug around the neck!

A hug around the neck, and a barrel and a heap

A barrel and a heap, and I'm talkin' in my sleep.

About you.

About you!

About you!

My heart is leapin'!

I'm having trouble sleepin'!

'Cause I love you, a bushel and a peck

You bet your pretty neck I do!

Doodle, oodle, oodle.

Doodle, oodle, oodle.

Doodle oodle oodle oo.

I love you, a bushel and a peck

A bushel and a peck, go and beats me all to heck!

Beats me all to heck how I'll ever tend the farm

Ever tend the farm when I want to keep my

Arms - about you -

About you!

About you!

The cows and chickens

are goin' to the dickens!

'Cause I love you a bushel and a peck

You bet your pretty neck I do -



Doodle oodle oodle

Doodle oodle oodle

Doodle oodle oodle, oo!



Good-bye now!

(they repeat the "doodles" as they exit)
