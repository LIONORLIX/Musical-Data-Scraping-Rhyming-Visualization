Adelaide's Lament


It says here:

The average unmarried female

Basically insecure

Due to some long frustration may react

With psychosomatic symptoms

Difficult to endure

Affecting the upper resperatory tract.



In other words, just from waiting around for that plain little band of gold

A person can develop a cold.



You can spray her wherever you figure there's streptococci lurk

You can give her a shot for whatever's she's got, but it just won't work

If she's tired of getting the fish eye from the hotel clerk

A person can develop a cold.



It says here:

The female remaining single

Just in the legal sense

Shows a neurotic tendancy, see note: (looks at note

Chronic organic symptoms

Toxic or hypertense

Involving the eye, the ear, the nose, and throat.



In other words, just from worrying if the wedding is on or off

A person can develop a cough.



You can feed her all day with the vitamin A and the bromofizz

But the medicine never gets anywhere near where the trouble is.

If she's getting a kind of name for herself, and the name ain't his

A person can develop a cough.



And furthur more, just from stalling, and stalling,

And stalling the wedding trip

A person can develop la grippe.



When they get on that train to Niagara

And she can hear church bells chime

The compartment is air conditioned

And the mood sublime

Then they get off at Saratoga for the fourteenth time!

A person can develop la grippe,

La grippe.

La post nasal drip.

With the wheezes

And the sneezes

And a sinus that's really a pip!



From a lack of community property

And a feeling she's getting TOO old

A person can develop a bad, bad cold!

(ADELAIDE sneezes)
