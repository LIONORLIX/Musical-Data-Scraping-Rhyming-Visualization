I've Never Been in Love Before


I've never been in love before

Now all at once it's you

It's you forever more.



I've never been in love before

I thought my heart was safe

I thought I knew the score

But this is wine that's all too strange and strong

I'm full of foolish song

And out my song must pour

So please forgive this helpless haze I'm in

I've really never been

In love before.



I've never been in love before

Now all at once it's you

It's you forever more.

I've never been in love before

I thought my heart was safe

I thought I knew the score

But this is wine that's all too strange and strong

I'm full of foolish song

And out my song must pour



So please forgive this helpless haze I'm in

I've really never been

In love before.
