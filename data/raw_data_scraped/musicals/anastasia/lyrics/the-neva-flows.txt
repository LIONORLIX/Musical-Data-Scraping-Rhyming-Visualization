The Neva Flows


Gleb:

Be very careful of these rumors that prevail

Be very careful what you say

I was a boy who lived the truth behind the tale

and no one got away

I saw the children as the soldiers closed the gate

The youngest daughter and her pride

My father leaving on the night they met their fate

His pistol by his side



The Neva flows,

a new wind blows

And soon it will be spring

The leaves unfold

The tzar lies cold

A revolution is a simple thing



Gleb (spoken):

I heard the shots

I heard the screams

But it's the silence after I remember most



Gleb (sung):

The world stopped breathing

And I was no longer a boy

My father shook his head and told me not to ask

My mother said he died of shame

But I believe he did a proud and vital task

And in my fathers name:



The Neva flows

A new wind blows

And soon it will be spring

The leaves unfold

The tzar lies cold



Gleb (aside):

Could I have pulled the trigger

If I'd been told.



Be careful what a dream may bring

A revolution

(spoken)

is

(sung)

a simple thing.
