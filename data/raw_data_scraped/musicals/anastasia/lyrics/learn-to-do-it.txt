Learn to Do It


VLAD

You were born in a palace by the sea



DMITRY

A palace by the sea



ANYA

Could it be?



VLAD

Yes, it’s so

You rode horseback when you were only three



ANYA

Horseback riding? Me?



DMITRY

Horse’s name



VLAD

Romeo

You threw tantrums and terrorized the cook

Ha!

How the palace shook



DMITRY

Charming child



VLAD

Wrote the book

But you’d behave when your father gave that look



DMITRY

Imagine how it was

Your long forgotten past



DMITRY & VLAD

We’ve lots and lots to teach you and the time is going fast



VLAD (spoken)

Let’s see you walk

Head up

Regal bearing

(sung)

Now shoulders back and stand up tall

And do not walk, but try to float



ANYA

I feel a little foolish

Am I floating?



DMITRY

Like a sinking boat



VLAD

You give a bow



ANYA

What happens now?



VLAD

Your hand receives a kiss



DMITRY & VLAD

Most of all remember this



VLAD

If I can learn to do it

You can learn to do it



DMITRY

Something in you knows it



DMITRY & VLAD

There’s nothing to it



VLAD

Follow in my footsteps

Shoe by shoe



DMITRY & VLAD

You can learn to do it too



DMITRY

Now elbows in and sit up straight

And do not slurp the stroganoff



ANYA

I never cared for stroganoff



VLAD

She said that like a Romanov



DMITRY

The Samovar



VLAD

The caviar



ANYA

Dessert and then goodnight?



DMITRY & VLAD

Not until you get this right



VLAD

If I can learn to do it



DMITRY

If he can learn to do it



VLAD

You can learn to do it



DMITRY

You can learn to do it



VLAD

Pull yourself together



DMITRY & VLAD

And you’ll pull through it



VLAD

Tell yourself it’s easy



DMITRY & VLAD

And it’s true

You can learn to do it too



VLAD (spoken)

Who is your great grandmother?



ANYA (spoken)

Queen Victoria.



VLAD (spoken)

Great-great grandmother?



ANYA (spoken)

Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld.



VLAD (spoken)

Your best friend is?



ANYA (spoken)

My little brother Alexei.



DMITRY (spoken)

Wrong. Your best friend is -



ANYA (spoken)

I know who my best friend is.



DMITRY (spoken)

What a temper.



ANYA (spoken)

I don’t like being contradicted.



DMITRY (spoken)

That makes two of us.



VLAD (spoken)

Continuing on.



ANYA

I’ve had it

And I hate you both

I’m sorry that we ever met

I’m hungry

And I’m frightened

And I’m only human

Don’t forget

I don’t remember anything

Get out and let me be



VLAD

Anya, darling

Look at me

We're all frightened

Well, slightly, now and then

Shall we start again?

Take a breath

Count to ten

You have courage

And strength you barely know

So blow that little nose

And dry those pretty eyes

A princess like Your Majesty can do this if she tries

Ready?



DMITRY

Set



ANYA

Go



VLAD

Now here’s your great-aunt Olga



DMITRY

How she frolicked

On the Volga



ANYA

Oh!



VLAD

Your distant cousin Vanya

Loved his vodka



DMITRY

Got it, Anya?



ANYA

No.



VLAD

The Duke of Oldenburg was short



DMITRY

Louise of Baden



ANYA

Had a



DMITRY

Wart



VLAD

Count Sergei



DMITRY

Wore a feathered hat



VLAD

I hear he’s gotten very fat



ANYA

And I recall his yellow cat



VLAD

I don’t believe we told her that



DMITRY & VLAD

If you can learn to do it



ANYA

If I can learn to do it



DMITRY & VLAD

He can learn to do it



ANYA

You can learn to do it



DMITRY & VLAD

Pull yourself together



ALL

And we’ll pull through it



VLAD

Tell yourself it’s easy



ALL

And it’s true



DMITRY & VLAD

You can learn to do it



ANYA

Nothing to it



ALL

You can learn to do it



ANYA

The caviar

The stroganoff

The Samovar

The feathered hat

The cousin drank

The Duke was short

And here a wart

And there a cat

The horse’s name was Romeo

So tell me something new



VLAD & DMITRY

Ha!



ANYA

Ah!



ALL

You can learn to do it too
