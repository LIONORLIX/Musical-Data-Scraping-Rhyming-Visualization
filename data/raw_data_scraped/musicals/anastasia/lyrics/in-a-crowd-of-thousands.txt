In a Crowd of Thousands


DMITRY

It was June

I was ten

I still think of that day

Now and then

A parade

And a girl

And a crowd of thousands

She sat straight

As a queen

Only eight

But so proud and serene

How they cheered

How I stared

In that crowd of thousands

Then I started to run

And to call out her name

As the crowd on the road went wild

I reached out with my hand

And looked up

And then she smiled

The parade

Traveled on

With the sun in my eyes

She was gone

But if I were still ten

In that crowd of thousands

I’d find her again



ANYA (spoken)

You’re making me feel I was there too.



DMITRY (spoken)

Maybe you were. Make it part of your story.



ANYA

A parade



DMITRY

A parade



ANYA

Passing by



DMITRY

Passing by



ANYA

It was hot

Not a cloud in the sky

Then a boy

Caught my eye



BOTH

In a crowd of thousands



ANYA

He was thin

Not too clean

There were guards

But he dodged in between

Yes he made himself seen

In that crowd of thousands

Then he called out my name

And he started to run

Through the sun and the heat

In the crowd

I tried not to smile

But I smiled

And then he bowed



DMITRY (spoken)

I didn’t tell you that.



ANYA (spoken)

You didn’t have to. I remember!



BOTH

The parade

Traveled on

With the sun in my eyes

You were gone

But I knew

Even then

In a crowd of thousands

I’d find you again



DMITRY (spoken)

Your highness.
