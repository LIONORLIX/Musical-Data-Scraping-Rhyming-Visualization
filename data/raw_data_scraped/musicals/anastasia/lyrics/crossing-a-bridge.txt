Crossing a Bridge


Look at the sky

Look at the water

Somebody's bridge

Somebody's daughter

Who could've known I'd be alone

Crossing this bridge



Boats heading in

Somebody calling

Sun going down

Shadows are falling

Shimmering view

Dangerous, too,

Crossing a bridge



Halfway between

Where I've been

And where I'm going

In between wondering why

And finally knowing



Thousands of lights

Shining below me

Somebody waits

Somebody, know me



Maybe we're sharing

This beautiful night

Me on the left bank

You on the right

Almost in sight...

Crossing a bridge



Every light is like a promise

Every light could be a clue

One of them might be you
