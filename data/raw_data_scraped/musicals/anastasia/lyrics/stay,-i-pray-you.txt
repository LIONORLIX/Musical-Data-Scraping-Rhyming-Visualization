Stay, I Pray You


COUNT IPOLITOV

How can I desert you

How to tell you why

Coachmen hold the horses

Stay, I pray you

Let me have a moment

Let me say goodbye

To bridge and river

Forest and waterfall

Orchard, sea, and sky

Harsh and sweet

And bitter to leave it all



ENSEMBLE

I’ll bless my homeland

Till I die

How to break the tide

We have shed our tears

And shared our sorrows

Though the scars remain

And tears will never dry

I’ll bless my homeland

Till I die



ANYA

Never to return



DMITRY

Finally breaking free



ANYA, DMITRY

You are all I know

You have raised me



VLAD

How to turn away

How to close the door



ANYA, DMITRY, VLAD

How to go where I have

Never gone before



ENSEMBLE

How can I desert you

How to tell you why



ALL

Coachmen hold the horses

Stay, I pray you

Let me have a moment

Let me say goodbye

Harsh and sweet

And bitter to leave it all

I’ll bless my homeland

Till I die



ANYA, DMITRY, VLAD

I’ll bless my homeland



ANYA, DMITRY

I’ll bless my homeland



ANYA

I’ll bless my homeland

Till I die
