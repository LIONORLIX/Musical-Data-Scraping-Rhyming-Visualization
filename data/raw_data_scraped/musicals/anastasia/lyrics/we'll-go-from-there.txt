We'll Go From There


VLAD

I may have gotten fatter

But maybe that won’t matter

Bottom line

I’ll win her

We’ll do some reminiscing

She’ll see what she’s been missing

Over wine

And dinner

And oh I know

I’ve grown a tiny bit grey

Some women say

I look distinguished this way

I’ll bow as if I’m still a frisky young pup

Let’s hope that I can straighten up

If she says no

We’ll all lay low

And we’ll go from there



ANYA

Hands shaking

Heart thundering

Meet the royal mess

Start smiling

Stop wondering

Why did I say yes



This chance



DMITRY

This chance



ANYA

Is all



DMITRY

Is all



ANYA & DMITRY

I’ve got



DMITRY

Get a grip and take a deep breath and

Soon, we’ll know what’s what

Put on our show

Rewards will flow

And we’ll go from there



ANYA

And we’ll go from there



VLAD

And we’ll go from there



ANYA, DMITRY, VLAD

And we’ll go from there



ALL

Oh what a lovely ride

And what a lovely day



ANYA, DMITRY, VLAD

For a totally illegal



ALL

Lovely getaway



[The Anya and Dmitry part is sung in counterpoint with Vlad’s]

Hands shaking



DMITRY

Hands shaking



ANYA

Heart thundering



ANYA & DMITRY

Meet the royal mess



ANYA

Start smiling



DMITRY

Start smiling



ANYA

Stop wondering



ANYA & DMITRY

Why did I say yes



ANYA

This chance



DMITRY

This chance



ANYA

Is all



DMITRY

Is all



ANYA & DMITRY

Soon we’ll know what’s what)

VLAD

But no more doubt



DMITRY

No time to spare



ANYA

We’re nearly out



ALL

So let’s prepare

We’re on our way

To who knows where



ANYA, DMITRY, VLAD

And we’ll go



MALE ENSEMBLE

And we’ll go



FEMALE ENSEMBLE

And we’ll go



ALL

From there



ANYA, DMITRY, VLAD

We’ll go from there
