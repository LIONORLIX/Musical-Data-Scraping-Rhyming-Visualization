In My Dreams


ANYA

They said I was found

By the side of a road

There were tracks all around

It had recently snowed

In the darkness and cold

The wind in the trees

A girl with no name

And no memories, but these

Rain against a window

Sheets upon a bed

Terrifying nurses

Whispering overhead

“Call the child Anya

Give the child a hat”

I don’t know a thing before that

Traveling the back roads

Sleeping in the wood

Taking what I needed

Working when I could

Keeping up my courage

As foolish as it seems

At night all alone in my dreams

In my dreams

Shadows call

There’s a light

At the end of a hall

Then my dreams

Fade away

But I know it all will come back

One day

I dream of a city

Beyond all compare

Is it Paris?

Paris

A beautiful river

A bridge by a square

And I hear a voice whisper

“I’ll meet you right there In Paris”

Paris

You don’t know what it’s like

Not to know who you are

To have lived in the shadows

And travel this far

I’ve seen flashes of fire

Heard the echos of screams

But I still have this faith

In the truth of my dreams

In my dreams

It’s all real

And my heart has so much to reveal

And my dreams

Seem to say

“Don’t be afraid to go on

Don’t give up hope

Come what may”

I know it all will come back

One day
