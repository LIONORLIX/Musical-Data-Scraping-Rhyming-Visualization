Paris Holds the Key (To Your Heart)


(Vlad)

Voilà!

Mes amis, here’s Paris.

Now that we’re here, follow me.

Begin with the new

As you stroll down la rue.



(Vlad & Ensemble)

And soon all Paris

Will be singing to you.



Paris holds the key to your heart

And all of Paris plays a part.

Paris’ turned a page

To the new modern age.



(Vlad)

And we’ll do it too if we’re smart!



(Ensemble)

The French have it down to an art.



Everyone’s a writer, painter, poet.

Everything is avant garde

Or chic.



(Vlad)

We’ll be in the know

Before we know it.



(Vlad & Ensemble)

When you’re in the know it’s-

Oh, it’s magnifique

To find in Paris what you seek.



(Dmitry)

Paris holds the key to her fate.

We won’t have much longer to wait

And then come what may

We will each go our way…



(Anya)

I dreamed of a city beyond all compare

It’s hard to believe that I’m finally there.



(Vlad)

At last, there’s a future.



(Dmitry)

There’s freedom.



(Anya)

There’s hope.



(Vlad, Dmitry & Anya)

In the air!



(All)

Paris holds the key to your heart

The pleasures of life à la carte

Come dance through the night

And forget all your woes

The city of light

How it glitters and glows

And one never knows what will start

Paris holds the key to your heart!
