Everything to Win


DMITRY:

What are they saying?

Wonder how long they'll be?

Why should I worry?

Worrying's not like me!



Nothing to do

But pace and stew

And wait till the girl walks in...

Why panic now

With everything to win?



Nothing but silence.

This could be bad, but

No! Let's assume it's good.

Thought it was foolproof.

Nothing is foolproof!

Whoa! Better knock on wood!



Girl gets a family,

Boy gets rich!

And fairytale gets a spin!

How can we fail

With everything to win!



I wonder

If our paths

Will ever cross again

The way they

Did when you were eight

And I was ten.



We said this was goodbye,

But even so

You never know.

You never know...



I should be glad that

We're breaking free, but

Nothing is what it was.

I didn't know

She mattered to me, but

Now I can see she does...



Con man and princess

Get their wish and

Fairytale comes true!

Funny, the one small part

I never knew...

With everything to win

The only thing I lose

Is you.
