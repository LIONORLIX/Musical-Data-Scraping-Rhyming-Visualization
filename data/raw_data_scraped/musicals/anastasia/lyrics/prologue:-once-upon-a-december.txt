Prologue: Once Upon a December


LITTLE ANASTASIA

(spoken) Why must you go, Nana?



THE DOWAGER EMPRESS

(spoken) I've stayed too long here.



LITTLE ANASTASIA

(spoken) Take me to Paris with you.



THE DOWAGER EMPRESS

(spoken) Wherever I go, you'll always be with me.

Our lullaby. When you play it, think of an old woman who loves you very, very much.



(sung) Far away,

Long ago,

Glowing dim as an ember,

Things my heart used to know,

Things it yearns to remember



BOTH

And a song someone sings,

Once upon a December.
