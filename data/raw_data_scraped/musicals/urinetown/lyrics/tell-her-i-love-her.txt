Tell Her I Love Her


Little Sally

Tell her I love her

Tell her I'll always be with her

And I will see her in a better place

Where hope is always new



Ours was a short time

Ours was a love that never bloomed

Yet in that love there lives

A brand new hope

It's calling out to you



Its call is soft and gentle

Tame and fine

It's docile and benign



Bobby

A pickle in the brine

What did I say? That isn't what I meant

I've lost my sense of scent

I fear my life is spent



Bobby and Little Sally

No one is innocent



Little Sally

No one.



Soupy Sue

"No one is innocent"? What did he mean by that?



Little Sally

I don't know, he started fading in and out after awhile. It was a

miracle he was alive at all, the fall was so horrible.



Tiny Tom

Was he talking about me? How can he say I'm not innocent? Not innocent

of what?



Little Sally

Wait! Wait, please. There's more. He said...



Tell all the people

Tell them the time is always now

Tell them to fight for

What they know is right



Bobby

I've lost my sense of sight

And yet I see them

I see them standing hand in hand



Bobby and Little Sally

I see them standing hand in hand

and cheek to cheek and gland to gland

There still is hope, I see it, in this land



Little Sally

If only -



Josephine

Yes?



Bobby and Little Sally

If only - !



All

Yes?!



Little Sally

And then he expired.
