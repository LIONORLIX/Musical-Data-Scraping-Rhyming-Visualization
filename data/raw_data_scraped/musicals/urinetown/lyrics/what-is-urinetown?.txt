What Is Urinetown?


Little Becky Two Shoes

What is Urinetown?

Urinetown's the end!

Swift and brutal punishment

No need now to pretend!



Hot Blades Harry

The trap door's sprung

And then you're hung

And when they cut you down

They'll box you up and ship you out

And call it Urinetown!



The Poor

They'll box you up and ship you out

And call it Urinetown!

Town!

Town!

Town!

Town!



Dance?

No!

Never do they dance!

Those people down in Urinetown

They never get the chance!

Dancing, forget it!

Never, nada, nope!

Unless it's at the bottom of a rope!

People hear lots of things about Urinetown, of course, and that's just

the way we like it. For example, a little boy once asked me, "Is

Urinetown actually a nice place to live? Gingerbread houses along

golden, frothy canals? Like Venice, only different?" I didn't say yes. I

didn't say no, either.



Cladwell

What is Urinetown?

Urinetown's a tool

An instrument of power

To enforce my iron rule

So send your troops

To all the stoops

And let them understand

If Hope is not returned

It's Urinetown for all the land!



The Poor

If Hope is not returned

It's Urinetown for all the land!

Land!

Land!

Land!

Land!



Cladwell

Dance?

Dance?

Do they think I'll dance?

Those people with my daughter

Want to make me change my stance

Stance-dance, forget it!

Never, nada, nein!

I'll teach them not to

Take from me what's mine!



Bobby

What is Urinetown?

Urinetown's a lie

A means to keep the poor in check

Until the day they die!

I did not shirk their dirty work

But things are different now

We'll fight for right

With all our might

Until we win somehow!



Bobby and Josephine

We'll fight for might

With all our might

Until we win somehow!

How!

How!

How!

How!



Bobby

Dance!

Dance!

Listen to it dance!

My heart is like a stallion

Racing through a great expanse

Canyons of freedom

That's where it will waltz

Performing coronary somersaults!



Little Sally

What is Urinetown?

Urinetown is here!

It's the "town" wherever

People learn to live in fear

So look around, you've finally found

The place you asked about

For Urinetown is your town

If you're hopeless down and out!



All

For Urinetown is your town

If you're hopeless, down and out!



Lockstock

For Urinetown is your town

If you're hopeless, down and out!



All

Out!

Out!

Out!

Out!



Hey!
