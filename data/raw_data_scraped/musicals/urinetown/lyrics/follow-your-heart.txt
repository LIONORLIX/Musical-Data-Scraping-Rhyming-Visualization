Follow Your Heart


Bobby

Did you mean what you said? About everyone having a heart?



Hope

Well, sure I did. Do you think you'd be feeling as bad as you do if you

didn't have a heart?



Bobby

I don't know. I spupose not.



Hope

Of course you wouldn't. Because then you'd be dead.



When darkness surrounds you

And you lose your way

You have your own compass

That turns night to day

And it's even with you

Before you depart

Be still, hear it beating

It's leading you

Follow your heart



Bobby

Follow my heart? But to where?



Hope

To wherever your heart tells you to go.



Bobby

Even...there?



Hope

Even to the clouds, if that's what your heart commands. What's it saying

now?



Bobby

I don't know. I don't know how to listen to my heart.



Hope

You have to listen carefully. Here, let me try.



Bobby

Do you -



Hope

Ssshhh! Ah, there it is. It's saying:



We all want a world

Filled with peace and joy

With plenty of water

For each girl and boy

That bright, shining world

Is just waiting to start

No meanness or sorrow

Just cleanness tomorrow

If only you follow your heart



You see there, Bobby. Even your heart knows you should follow your heart.



Bobby

"Peace and joy", "plenty of water"

I guess I do want those things



Hope

There's something else your heart was saying. Maybe something I

shouldn't have heard.



Bobby

There was?



Hope

I think so. It was barely audible but I definitely heard something.



Bobby

Well? What was it?



Hope

Let me try again, maybe I can make it out this time.



There is is. So faint...it's saying:



Follow, into the open air

Far from squalor and noise

Follow, someone is waiting there

Someone who shares all your hopes

And your joys



"Someone is waiting there"? Why, my heart was saying those exact words

just the other day.



Bobby

It was?



Hope

Sure it was. "Squalor and Noise", "Hopes and Joys". It was telling me

about all those things.



Bobby

I didn't know two hearts could speak as one.



Hope

I didn't either. Until now. Here, listen.



Bobby

Someday I'll meet someone

Whose heart joines with mine

Aortas and arteries all intertwined

They'll beat so much stronger

Than they could apart

Eight chambers of muscle to hustle

The love in our heart



Bobby and Hope

Love is kind and considerate

Love is peaceful and fair

Love can creep up so suddenly

When you least think of it

Your love is there



We all want a world

Filled with peace and with joy

With plenty of justice

For each girl and boy

That bright shining world

Is just waiting to start

No anger or badness

Just laughter and gladness

If only I follow your heart
