Look At The Sky


Penny

You've got a sweet lookin' head, Bobby, a sweet lookin' head! But you

keep it up there in the clouds day after day after day and it's gotta

come down from there. You hear me?! Get that head out of the clouds,

Bobby Strong! You get it out of the clouds!



Bobby

Off in the distance

There's a beautiful horizon -

Gleaming and radiant

It's what I'll keep my eyes on -

As the world turns to face the sun

And start another day

It suddenly

Occurs to me

That maybe we can find another way

Look at the sky

Full of hope and promise

It's a shining ideal

How I reel

When I look at the sky



Daily we make them pay

Their nickles dimes and quarters -

Daily we break them

'Cause we have to follow orders

And we keep filling moneybags

With broken lives and dreams

But what's it for?

I can't ignore

These black immoral

Profit-making schemes



Look at the sky

High above this madness!

Here below feel our shame!

It must stop in the name

Of the sky!



Penny

The fee is the law, Bobby Strong.



Bobby

And what if there was a new law in town, Ms. Pennywise? A new law that

didn't come from any voting process or elected body or process of

judicial review, but a brand new law that came from an organ. That's

right, a muscular, blood-pumping organ. Like this one. Right here.



Penny

A muscular organ?



Bobby

Can't you see it, Ms. Pennywise? Well, if this one's too small for you

why not try this one on for size?!



Penny

It's...it's blinding me!



Bobby

Look at the sky!

There's a great big heart there!

There's a heart

In the sky

There just is

Don't ask why -

It's the sky!



Penny

Don't do this, Bobby. You'll regret it.



Bobby

I don't think so. C'mon, Ma. This one's on the house. For everyone!

Forever!



The Poor

Hooray!



Soupy Sue

Your heart knows all things

Great and true



Tiny Tom

The things mere brains can never know



Josephine

Your heart point to

The great big blue -



The Poor

Where the people's allgiance must go!



Bobby

Tell me where!



The Poor

Look at the sky!

That's our inspiration! Bobby

Look at the sky!

Look at the sky!



The Poor

We can win

If we try

We begin

When we look at the sky!



Penny

Oh Bobby, what's to become of you? What's to become of us all?!



The Poor

Look at the sky!

Standard of the people! Bobby

Off in the distance

There's a beautiful horizon



The Poor

It's a banner so wide

Flying proudly with pride

In the sky



Bobby

In the sky



The Poor

In the sky!
