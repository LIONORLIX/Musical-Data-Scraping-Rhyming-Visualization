Act One Finale


Bobby

Free!

People are free!

How can a fee

Enslave us?

See

How we can be

Free from the chains

He gave us!



We're suffering now

Such lives of sorrow

Don't give us tomorrow

Just give us today!



The Poor

Free!

People are free!

How can a fee

Enslave us?

See

How we can be

Free from the chains

He gave us!



We're suffering now

Such lives of sorrow

Don't give us tomorrow

Just give us today!



Bobby

From ev'ry hill

Ev'ry steeple

Ring out the anthem

Of the people

Making a new way

Breaking the clouds of gray

To sing of today!



Bobby and The Poor

Sing of today!

Sing of today

Sing today

Sing today

Sing today



Cladwell

A little brutality is exactly what these people need. Officer Lockstock!



Hope

Daddy, wait. He only wants the people to be happy.



Cladwell

Happy you say?! Happy?!



So you want happy, Mister Strong?

Did you say happy, Mister Strong?

If they pee today I'm sure they'll be

As happy as a pup

With no rules and no more fees to pay

Things would be looking up!

But too bad the water that we share

Could fit inside a cup!

What of tomorrow, Mister Strong?



Bobby

But what of today?!



Cladwell

But what of tomorrow, Mister Strong?!

Think of tomorrow, Mister Strong!

Our resources are as fragile

As a newborn baby's skull

With your actions

You would gut the child

And leave a lifeless hull!

Could it be you're so short-sighted

So insensitive, so dull?

Think of tomorrow, Mister Strong!



The Poor

But what of today?!



Cladwell and Co.

You are wrong, Mister Strong

You and your socialistic throng

If the people pee for free

They'll push the system to the brink

If today there's spillage

Tell us how tomorrow will not stink!



Cladwell

If it's you and me, now, Mister Strong

Which one of us will blink?

I say it's you, Mister Strong

For on the subject of tomorrow



Cladwell and Co.

You are wrong!



Hope

Oh, Bobby, why didn't you tell me you were going to start a revolution?



Bobby

Maybe for the same reason you didn't tell me you were a Cladwell. So you

can join us or you can stand aside.



Hope

Bobby, think!

You're standing on the brink!

You'll be arrested soon

Perhaps as soon as noon



And I could never bear

To see you taken where

The guilty pee-ers meet

The toilet judgement seat!



Bobby

You said

To follow your heart

Here's where my heart leads

Now I'll do my part

To banish all needs



You made me to see

Fantastic'lly clear

When people pee free

We've nothing to fear



Hope

Give up now!

We'll find a way

Somehow

To help the people pee



Without a hefty fee

But if you must persist

Being an anarchist

My father's men will see

You're sent away from me!

You'll get Urinetown!



Bobby, you'll get Urinetown!



Off you'll go to Urinetown!



Urinetown!



Urinetown!

Bobby

Your words

Were like seeds



At first they

Seemed mild



They grew into deeds



This riot's our child



Sing of today, not tomorrow!



End their lives of sorrow!



Today!



Today!



Sing of today!



Cladwell

You've picked a fight you can't win, today, Mr. Strong! Your rabble is

no match for my men.



Little Sally

You can punish our bodies, Mr. Cladwell, but you can never punish our

spirits!



Soupy Sue

Punish our bodies?!



Little Becky Two Shoes

I never agreed to any punishment of my body!



Cladwell

Oh, punishment is all you'll ever know!



The Poor

Bobby, help!

He'll turn our brains to kelp!

No matter what we do

We're in a real bad stew!

Those cops look awful mean

Like none we've ever seen!

When Cladwell gives the cue

Our revolution's through! Cladwell and UGC Staff

You

Are wrong, Mr. Strong!

You

Are wrong, Mr. Strong!

Very

Wrong, Mr. Strong!

You

Are wrong, Mr. Strong!



Bobby

Last night your words

Were like seeds

At first

They seemed mild

They grew

Into deeds

This riot's

Our child! The Poor

Bobby, please!

There's no way to appease

A raging maniac

A real insaniac

He's like a speeding train

Caught in a hurricane

But he is in control

And he is on a roll! Cladwell and UGC Staff

You

Are wrong, Mr. Strong!

You

Are wrong, Mr. Strong!

Very

Wrong, Mr. Strong!

You

Are wrong, Mr. Strong!



Bobby





The child

Is on fire





He's hot

As the sun





He'll burn

Like a pyre





'Til freedom

Is won! Hope



Oh

Bobby!





No,

Bobby!





Oh

Bobby!





No,

Bobby!



The Poor

Cladwell's

Nuts

With no if's, and's

Or but's!

Yes, he's a real

Live loon!

A freaking

Looney tune!

And when he's

Done with us

He'll put us on a

Bus

Bound for that

Unknown place

That we all

All dread to face! Cladwell and UGC Staff



You

Are wrong

Mr. Strong!



You

Are wrong

Mr. Strong!



Very

Wrong

Mr. Strong!



You

Are wrong

Mr. Strong!



All but Bobby

You'll/We'll get

Urinetown!



Bobby, you'll/we'll get

Urinetown!



Off you'll/we'll go to

Urinetown!



Urinetown!



Urinetown!

Bobby



Sing of today

Not tomorrow!



End their lives

Of sorrow!



Today!



Today!



Sing of today!



Hope

So what'll it be, Bobby?



Bobby

Looks like we're in a real bad spot, doesn't it. I suppose we should leave.



Hope

Oh, Bobby, they'll never let you leave now.



Bobby

Not without you they won't. Which is why you're coming with us.



Hope

But how can I come with you and not fight against my father,

unless...unless...oh dear God, Bobby, no!



Bobby and Poor

From ev'ry

Hill

Ev'ry steeple



Ring out the anthem



Of the people

Making a new way



Breaking the

Clouds of gray



To sing of today!





Sing of today!







Sing of today!







Sing today!



Sing today!



sing today! Cladwell and Co.



Wrong, Mr. Strong!

Think of tomorrow

Mr. Strong!

Our resources as as

Fragile as a

Newborn baby's skull!

With your

Actions you would

Leave a lifeless hull!

A lifeless hull

Mr. Strong!

You're very dull

Mr. Strong!

Disperse your throng

Mr. Strong!

Disperse your throng

And end your song

And end your song

Mr. Strong!

You're wrong,

Mr. Strong!

You're wrong,

Mr. Strong!

You're wrong,

Mr. Strong!

You're wrong!



Bobby

Keep your men back, Cladwell! We've got your daughter and we're not

letting her go!



Lockstock

Boss, what do we do?!



Cladwell

Seize them!



Penny

No!



Cladwell

Don't let them get away!



Hope

Help me!



Penny

Help her!



Bobby

Now run, run everybody! Run for your lives! Run!



Women

Urinetown!



Urinetown!



Urinetown!



Urinetown!



Urinetown!



Urinetown! Men



Urinetown!



Urinetown!

Urinetown!



Urinetown!



Urine - !

Urinetown!



Lockstock

Well, that's it for Act One.

As you can see, the rebel poor are making

their get-away with Hope as their hostage

The rest of us have been

thrown into confusion because -

well, because we're all moving

so damned slowly. So we don't

get to catch them. Not yet.

Enjoy intermission,

and see you -

shortly!



All

Urinetown!
