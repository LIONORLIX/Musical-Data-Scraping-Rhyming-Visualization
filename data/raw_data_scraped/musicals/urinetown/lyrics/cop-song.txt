Cop Song


Lockstock

If there's one thing I've learned in my many years of enforcing the laws

of this city, it's that the journey down to Urinetown offers no

surprises. Not even from the very toughest amongst us. On that journey

expect only the expected.



It's a hard, cold, tumble of a journey

Worthy of a gurney, a bumble down

A slapped face, smacked with a mace

Certain to debase is our stumble down



It's a path that leads you only one place

Horrible to retrace, a crumble down

A hard, cold, tumble of a tourney

Jumble of a journey to Urinetown



Lockstock and Barrel

Julie Cassidy

Went to a field behind a tree

Saw there was no one who could see



Lockstock

Her pee -



Barrel



Lockstock and Barrel

And Jacob Rosenblum

Thought he was safe up in his room

Didn't know the jars he kept up there

Would obligate a trip to Urine-tomb!



Lockstock

There are those who think our

Methods vicious -



Barrel

Overly malicious -



Lockstock

A bunch of brutes, but it's we who

Gather for the people -



Barrel

Tavern to the steeple -



Lockstock

Lawful fruits!

Our task: bring a little order -



Barrel

Swindle out a hoarder -



Lockstock

From what he loots, as the book says

"Certainly a season" -



Barrel

Trample out a treason -



All

With hobnail boots!

Roger Roosevelt

Kept a cup below his belt

Cup ran over when he knelt



Lockstock

He smelt -



Barrel

We dealt!



All

And Joseph "Old Man" Strong

Held his pee for much too long

Hoped his son might bail him out

His guess was good but also wrong!



Lockstock

Years past all lived in a jungle

Scooping out a bungle, nature's bowl

Life of constant deprivation

Certain aggravation took its toll



Soon learned power of the truncheon

Organize a function king to pawn

So if peace is what you're after

Urinetown's the rafter to hang it on!

Lockstock and Barrel

Don't be like them! Don't be like them!



Lockstock

It's a hard, cold,

Tumble of a journey

Worthy of a gurney,

A bumble down

A slapped face,

Smacked with a mace

Certain to debase

Is our stumble down Female Cops



It's a hard, cold,

Tumble of a journey

Worthy of a gurney,

A bumble down

A slapped face,

Smacked with a mace

Certain to debase Male Cops





It's a hard, cold,

Tumble of a journey

Worthy of a gurney,

A bumble down

A slapped face,

Smacked with a mace



All

It's a path that leads you only one place

Horrible to retrace, a crumble down

A hard, cold, tumble of a tourney

Jumble of a journey to Urinetown!
