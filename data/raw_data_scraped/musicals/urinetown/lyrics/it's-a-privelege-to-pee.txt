It's A Privelege To Pee


Old Man Strong

Bobby! Bobby, reason with the woman. I'm a little short this morning.



Bobby

He's my Pa, Ms. Pennywise. Can't he come in for free? Just this once?



Penny

Get your head out of the clouds, Bobby Strong. No one gets in for free.

Every morning you all come here. And every morning some of you got

reasons why ya ain't gonna pay. And I'm here to tell ya ya is gonna pay!



Old Man Strong

In the name of God, Penny, what difference could it make?



Penny

What difference?!



"Times are hard"

"Our cash is tight"

"You've got no right"

I've heard it all before

"Just this once"

Is once too much

Cause once they've onced

They'll want to once once more



I run the only toilet

In this part of town, you see

So, if you've got to go

You've got to go through me



It's a privilege to pee

Water's worth its weight

In gold these days



No more bathrooms

Like in olden days

You come here and pay a fee

For the privilege to pee



Twenty years we've had the drought

And our reservoirs have all dried up

I take my baths now in a coffee cup

I boil what's left of it for tea

And it's a privilege to pee



The politicians in their wisdom saw

That there should be a law

The politicians taxed the toilets

And made illegal

Public urination and defecation



So, come and give your coins to me

Write your name here in the record book

The authorities will want to look

If you've been regular with me

If you've paid the proper fee

For the privilege to pee



Bobby

But Ms. Pennywise -



Penny

I said no buts, Bobby. You're a sweet lookin' boy and I likes to keep

you around, but this main ain't comin' in without payin'. Not this time.



Old Man Strong

I can't wait much longer, Bobby. There's no tellin' what I might do!



Penny

You think you've got

Some kind of right?



The Poor

Kind of right, kind of right!



Penny

You think you'll come in here and go for free?



The Poor

Snag a freebie!



Penny

The only thing you'll get it "no" for free!



The Poor

Negatory!



Penny

I'm a business gal, you see



The Poor

Business gal you see!



Penny

I sell the

Privilege to pee! The Poor



It's a privilege to pee



Penny

The good Lord made us

So we'd piss each day

Until we piss away

The good Lord made sure

That what goes in men

Must soon come out again

So you're no different then

From lowly me



The Poor

Me

Lowly me

Lowly me

Lowly me

Lowly me!



Bobby

But, Ms. Pennywise -



Old Man Strong

That's enough, Bobby.



Penny

And I think I'll charge you twice



Old Man Strong

No need to jeopardize your position.



Penny

Or better yet, have you arrested



Old Man Strong

I'm through with all this, you see.



Penny

Since you prefer the law gets tested



Old Man Strong

Scrapin' cash three times a day



Penny

And in Urinetown you'll see



Old Man Strong

Crazy with the nitrates half the time



Penny

Why it's dumb to fight with me



Old Man Strong

It's no way to live, I tells ya. No way to live.



Penny

For the privilege to pee!
