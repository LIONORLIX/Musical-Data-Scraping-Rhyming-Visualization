I See A River


Hope

I see a river flowing for freedom

I see a river just in view

I see a river flowing for freedom

I see a river straight and true



Come to the river flowing for justice

Come to the river rendezvous

Come to the river flowing for justice

All for the people, me and you



Lockstock

Well, as you guessed, Hope took over her father's business, instituting

a series of reforms which opened the public bathrooms to all the people,

to pee for free whenever they liked, as much as they liked, for as long

as they liked, with whomever they liked. The UGC was renamed, "The Bobby

Strong Memorial Toilet Authority" and was operated as a public trust for

the benefit of the people.



Little Becky Two Shoes

Sisters and brothers fight for the river



Hope

Fathers and mothers



Little Becky Two Shoes

Babies, too!



Hope and Little Becky Two Shoes

All in the family, push toward the river

Shove toward the river, why don't you?



All

Step in the river, wade in the river

Soak in the river through and through

Once in the river, you are the river

Friends on the shorelines, jump in too



Lockstock

Of course, it wasn't long before the water turned silty, brackish and

then disappeared altogether. As cruel as Caldwell B. Cladwell was, his

measures effectively regulated water consumption, sparing the town the

same fate as the phantom Urinetown. Hope chose to ignore the warning

signs, however, preferring to bask in the people's love for as long as

it lasted.



Little Sally

What kind of musical is this?! The good guys finally take over and then

everything starts falling apart.



Lockstock

Like I said, Little Sally. This isn't a happy musical.



Little Sally

But the music's so happy!



Lockstock

Yes, Little Sally. Yes it is.



Josephine

Such a fever. If only I had a cool, tall glass of water, maybe I'd have

a fighting chance.



Hope

But don't you see, Mrs. Strong? The glass of water's inside you, it

always has been.



Josephine

It has?



Hope

Of course it has. Don't you know what you are?



Josephine

A river?



Hope

That's right. We all are.



You are the river, I am the river

He is the river, she is too



Hope and Josephine

All are the river flowing for freedom

Flowing for justice, let's review



All

We see a river flowing for freedom

We see a river just in view

You see a river flowing for freedom

You see a river straight and true



Little Sally

I don't think too many people are going to come see this musical,

Officer Lockstock.



Lockstock

Why do you say that, Little Sally? Don't you think people want to be

told that their way of life is unsustainable?



Little Sally

That, and the title's awful.



Lockstock

I suppose you're right, Little Sally. I do suppose you're right.



Little Sally

Can't we do a happy musical next time?



Lockstock

If there is a next time I'm sure we can. Well, that's our story. Hope

eventually joined her father in a manner not quite so gentle. As for the

people of this town? They did as best they could. But they were prepared

for the world they inherited, weaned as they were on the legend born of

their founding father's scare tactics. For when the water dried up, they

recognized their town for the first time for what it really was. What it

was always waiting to be.



All

This is Urinetown!

Always it's been Urinetown!

This place, it's called Urinetown!



Lockstock

Hail Malthus!



All

Hail Malthus!



Lockstock

Thank you. And goodnight.



All

That was our show!
