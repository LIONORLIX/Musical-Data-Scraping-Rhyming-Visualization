Mr. Cladwell


Cladwell

I saw gray skies, foreboding and cold!

I saw gray skies and made them rain gold!

Now those skies aren't so bleak to behold!

They're still gray

But they pay

For your sal'ries tenfold!



I took this town that formerly stank

I took this town and made it smell swank!

I made flushing mean flush at the bank!

I'm the man

With the plan

And so who should you thank?



McQueen

Whom?



Chorus

Mister Cladwell

We're so thankful

For that bank full of dough!

You're a toreador

And it's cash that you gore!

Could we hope for much more?

We really doubt it!



Cladwell

You may be right there!



Chorus

Mister Cladwell

You've got riches

Which is just what we need!



We say

Hail to you, the Duke of the ducats!



Cladwell

I can bring in bucks by the buckets!



Chorus

You're the master

You're making money!



Cladwell

Faster still than bees making honey!



Chorus

You're Mister Cladwell!



Hope

Gosh Daddy, I never realized large, monopolizing corporations could be

such a force for good in the world.



Cladwell

Few do.



McQueen

All those coins

That we take from the throng

End up here

Where those coins all belong

Lots of coins

Make our company strong!



Cladwell

Charging fees

As we please

Is our right - it's not wrong!



McQueen

We're not greedy as some make us seem

We need funds for our big research team



Dr. Billeaux

Men in labcoats and test tubes with steam!



Cladwell and McQueen

What it shows

No one knows

But, hey, still we can dream!



McQueen

Of!



Chorus

Mister Cladwell

Finding answers

Curing cancers

Of doubt!



Your ambitions are high

But you're

Humble as pie!

What a wonderful guy!

We simply love you!



Hope

Da-



Da, Da

Da, Da, Daddy

That's my Dad!

Daddy

Daddy

That's my Daddy

And I simply

Love you!



Cladwell

You're making me blush now!



Chorus

Mister Cladwell

You're so godly!

Oddly perfect and right!



Men

You are continental, yet

Unpretentious!



Women

Fancy-free, yet so conscientious!



Men

Wise but trendy, tough as a mountain!



Chorus

Goodness flows from you like a fountain!

You're mister, you're Mister -



Cladwell

Cladwell!



Chorus

Cladwell!
