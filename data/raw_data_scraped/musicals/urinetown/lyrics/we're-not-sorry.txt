We're Not Sorry


Little Sally

With a lust for

Saving water

Man gives daughter

Up for dead



Hot Blades Harry

Play it on your

Stradivari!

He's not sorry

Not a shred!



The Rebels

He's not sorry...

He's not sorry...

He's not sorry...

He's not sorry... Barrel

An absolute maze,

that's what the

sewer system is.



Lockstock

I'm going back down to give it another look. You stay here to guard the

streets.



Josephine

You who fly the

Blimp of evil

Shun upheaval

In the air!



Soupy Sue

Then ask why the

Ride gets jarry -

Now you're sorry

You're up there



The Rebels

Now you're sorry...

Now you're sorry...



Those who made dough

From debasing

Need erasing

Need the knife



Let their blood flow

Like Campari!

We're not sorry -

Hey that's life!



The Rebels

Once they liked to

Shoot their rifles

Just for trifles

Hunt us down! UGC Staff

We're not sorry!

We're not sorry!

We're not sorry!

We're not sorry now!



All

Ba-dap! Ba-dap!



The Rebels

Now it's we who

Play safari -

UGC Staff

Sorry!

We're not sorry!

We're not -



Cladwell and Co.

We're not sorry!



The Rebels

They're not sorry!



Billy Boy Bill

I'm not sorry!



All

No one's sorry

No one's sorry

'Til they get to Urine
