Why Did I Listen To That Man?


Penny

Why did I listen to that man?

Why did I listen to

The nature of his plan?

And when he talked

I should have balked

I should have walked

I should have ran!

Why did I listen to that man?



Fipp

Why did I listen to that crook?

A little bribe in cash is all it really took

That's how that craven

Toilet maven

Made me cave in

I'm a schnook!

Why did I listen to that crook?



Bobby

You lied to us, Cladwell! You told us one thing, then you did another!

That's what you did, Cladwell! That's what you did!



Lockstock and Barrel

Now we've finally got you!

Now you're in our claws!

Captured in our city

Of laws



There's no trial or jury

Nothing to discuss

Now the law is speaking

Through us!



You'll get Urinetown!

Off with you to Urinetown!

Away with you to Urinetown!

Now, no more funn!



Penny

Let go of me! I have to save Hope!



Business Man 2

There's no saving Hope now, Ms. Pennywise.



Business Man 1

There may be no saving you.



Penny

Oh, no?! Then take that! And that! And this! And a few of these!



Hope

Why did I listen to that boy?

He spoke of hopes and dreams

It filled me with such joy

How can I know

He loved me so?

Was it for show?

Was I his toy?

Why did I listen to that boy?



Penny

Why did I listen to that cad?



Hope

Why did I listen to my dad?



Hope and Penny

I went to work for him

He said he was so glad



Hope

Was he sincere?



Penny

Well, now it's clear



Hope

And now I fear



Hope and Penny

That I've been had!

Bobby

So what's it like, this "Urinetown" that I've heard so much about?



Barrel

Perhaps better for us to "show" you.



Bobby

Wait a minute, you're just going to throw me off this roof and tha's

supposed to be Urinetown?! Death is Urinetown?!



Lockstock

That's one interpretation



Bobby

Why did I listen to my heart?



I heard its call and made

This revolution start

So let the throng

Take up my song!

Make Cladwell see

That he is wrong

Why did I listen to my heart?



Why did I listen to my heart?

Take up my song!

Make Cladwell see
