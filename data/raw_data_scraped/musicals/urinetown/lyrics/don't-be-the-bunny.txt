Don't Be The Bunny


Cladwell

A little bunny in the meadow

Is nibbling grass without a care

He's so delightful as he hops for you

You say, "Hi, bunny"

And he stops for you

You pull your trigger

And he drops for you

Goodbye, bunny-boo

Hello, rabbit stew!



Get me, boys?



Staff

You tell 'em, boss!



Cladwell

Don't be the bunny

Don't be the stew

Don't be the dinner

You have better things to do

That's why it's funny

So take your cue

Don't be the bunny

Don't be the bunny



Hope

But Daddy, we're talking about people, not animals.



Cladwell

People are animals, Hope dear.



Hope

Animals with huge incisors and big floppy feet?



Cladwell

Look closely, you'll see them. I do. I see them...everywhere.



A little bunny at a toll booth

He needs a measly fifty cents

Our little bunny didn't plan ahead

Poor bunny simply hasn't got the bread

He begs for mercy, but gets jail instead

Hasenpfeffer's in the air

As the bunny gets the chair!



See the moral, people?



Staff

Clear as day, boss!



Cladwell

Don't be the bunny

Don't be the dope

Don't be the loser

You're much better than that, Hope!

You're born to pow'r

You're in the money!

Advice to you

Don't be the bunny



Hope

A little bunny at a tollbooth?



Cladwell

You heard me.



Hope

But Daddy, bunnies don't drive cars.



Cladwell

Oh, don't they?!



Hope

No, actually, I don't think they do.



Cladwell

Live long enough, Hope dear, you see...many things.



Hope

Even a daughter doubting her father?



Cladwell

A little bunny in a shoe box

He thinks he's found a brand new home

So snug and cozy on your closet floor

Now what's that bunny in my closet for?

With a mallet and some clippers

You find out: new bunny slippers!



Grasp the message, staff?



Staff

Right behind you, boss!



Cladwell and Staff

Don't be the bunny

Don't be the shoe

You don't get stepped on -



Cladwell

No, the one who steps is you!



Cladwell and Staff

You're stepping up

To where it's sunny

Step on the poor!

Don't be the bunny!

Don't be the bunny!

Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah!
