Too Much Exposition


Lockstock

Well, hello there. And welcome - to Urinetown! Not the place, of course.

The musical. Urinetown "the place" is ... well, it's a place you'll hear

people referring to a lot through the show.



Penny

You hear the news? They carted Old "So and So" off to Urinetown the

other day.



Bobby

Is that so? What he do?



Penny

Oh, such and such, I hear.



Bobby

Well, what do you know. Old "So and So".



Lockstock

It's kind of a mythical place, you understand. A bad place. A place you

won't see until Act Two. And then...? Well, let's just say it's filled

with symbolism and things like that. But Urinetown "the musical", well,

here we are. Welcome. It takes place in a town like any town...that you

might find in a musical. This here's the first setting for the show. As

the sign says, it's a "public amenity", meaning public toilet. These

people have been waiting for hours to get in. It's the only amenity they

can afford to get into.



Little Sally

Say, Officer Lockstock, is this where you tell the audience about the

water shortage?



Lockstock

What's that, Little Sally?



Little Sally

You know, the water shortage. The hard times. The drought. A shortage so

awful that private toilets eventually become unthinkable. A premise so

absurd that -



Lockstock

Whoa, there, Little Sally. Not all at once. They'll hear more about the

water shortage in the next scene.



Little Sally

Oh, I guess you don't want to overload them with too much exposition, huh.



Lockstock

Everything in its time, Little Sally. You're too young to understand it

now, but nothing can kill a show like too much exposition.



Little Sally

How about bad subject matter?



Lockstock

Well -



Little Sally

Or a bad title, even? That could kill a show pretty good.



Lockstock

Well, Little Sally, suffice it to say that in Urinetown (the musical)

everyone has to use public bathrooms in order to take care of their

private business. That's the central conceit of the show!



Better hope your pennies

Add up to the fee -

We can't have you peeing

For free

If you do, we'll catch you

We, we never fail!

And we never bother with jail



All

You'll get Urinetown!

Off you'll go to Urinetown!

Away with you to Urinetown!



Lockstock

You won't need bail



Later on you'll learn that these "public bathrooms" are controlled by a

private company. They keep admission hight, generally, so if you're down

on your luck you have to come to a place like this - one of the poorest,

filthiest urinals in town.



Little Sally

And you can't just go in the bushes either, there's laws against it.



Lockstock

That's right, Little Sally. Harsh laws, too. That's why Little Sally

here's counting her pennies. Isn't that so, Little Sally?



Little Sally

I'm very close, Officer. Only a few pennies away.



Lockstock

Aren't we all, Little Sally. Aren't we all.



/(to audience)/

Well, we've talked on long enough, I imagine. Enjoy the show. And

welcome - to Urinetown (the musical)!
