Snuff That Girl


Hot Blades Harry

Whaddaya think they talk about in those quorums they got up there - how

good we are?! So listen up, now! Any second those cops are gonna bust in

here and bust us up like a bunch of overripe canteloupes! So I say as

long as our juice has gotta spill - all over this floor, here - her

juice has gotta spill, to! Cladwell juice! Then we'll see who's better

than who.



Look at here there

All bound up, gagged and tied

With her head full of hair

And her heart full of pride!



Well, boys, I've had enough

Of each arrogant curl!

Bing! Bang! Boom! Let's get tough

Playin' rough -

Snuff that girl!



Little Sally

"Snuff that girl"? But killing people is wrong!



Little Becky Two Shoes

Then why does it feel so right?



Look at us here

In a hole, on the lam

With our hearts full of fear -

What a rip! What a sham!

You know, cops will be here

Bustin' heads mighty quick!



Hot Blades Harry

But we'll beat them to the bunch

When we snuff out that chick!



Little Becky Two Shoes

We tried doin' what we should!



Hot Blades Barry

Wasn't glad!



Little Beck Two Shoes

Then we learned that feelin' good



Hot Blades Harry

Mean's doin' bad!



Both

Nuts, they fall close

So they say, to the tree

Looky here, here's an a-

Corn from Cladwell I see

I say, she is the nut

and of course, we're the squirrel!

She is what we saved for winter

So let's snuff that girl!



Hot Blades Harry

Bing!



Tiny Tom

Bing!



Little Beck Two Shoes

Bing Bang!



Soupy Sue

Bing Bang!



Hot Blades Harry

A-Bing Bang Boom!



Robbie the Stockfish

Boom!



Billy Boy Bill

Boom!



Hot Blades Harry

Yeah!



Little Beck Two Shoes

Okay now, snuff!



Billy Boy Bill

Snuff the girl!



Little Beck Two Shoes

Yeah!



Soup Sue and Billy Boy Bill

Snuff the girl!



Tiny Tom and Robbie the Stockfish

Snuff her!



Hot Blades Harry and Little Beck Two Shoes

Oh yeah, now go!



Robbie the Stockfish

Snuff the girl!



Hot Blades Harry and Little Beck Two Shoes

Yeah!



Billy Boy, Robbie, Tiny Tom, Hot Blades Harry

Snuff the girl!



All

Yeah, snuff the girl!



This is the end

Roll the dice, place your bets!

In this mis'rable world

That's as good as it gets!

So now, let's live it up

Eat the oyster and the pearl



And let's get this party jumpin'!

Really get it pumpin'!

Get this party jumpin'

Yeah, let's snuff that -

Snuff that girl!
