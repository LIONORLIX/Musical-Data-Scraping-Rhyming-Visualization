Fill In The Words


You play a C

You get a C

That’s simple

That’s easy



But there was you

And there was me

Not so simple

Not easy



I’m never quite able to say what I feel

I know that sounds absurd

The only way you can hear me

Is to listen to my song without words



(melody)

That’s what I’m saying right now

And I’m writing this love song just for you to fill in the words



You were everything good

I know you love me

I just couldn’t make us work out

And all I could do was leave it to you to fill in the words

Fill in the words



If I had the words

I’d have a song

And maybe it would tell me where I belong

With you I had the words for free

It’s just in loving you I was losing me



(melody)

Hoping you’ll understand

That until I can find those words for myself will you fill in the words

Fill in the words



(melody)

Fill in the words



(melody)

If I had the words

I’d have a song

And maybe it would tell me where I belong

With you and me I wasn’t sure

Was I less were you more?



(melody)

Hoping you’ll give me some time

If that kid on the coat rack wants to come back

wants one more try

Where will you be?

Will you still fill in the words?

Will you fill in the words?
