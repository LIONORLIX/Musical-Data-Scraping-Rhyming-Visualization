They're Playing My Song (Hers)


SONIA

Oh ho they’re playing my song

Oh yeah they’re playing my song

And when they’re playing my song

Every body’s got to

Sh Sh Sh



The magic of words is weaving it’s spell ‘round this room

Nobody’s dancin’ they’re all too entranced in

Just listening to the perfect way my words fit that tune



Right now they’re listening to me

My lyric reads like a poem

It surely stands on it’s own

It makes me proud to hear that music



It’s the total expression of me

To be more specific this place is terrific

As long as they’re playin’ my song



Who would have known

That two years ago when Leon asked

‘Can’t lovin’ be fun?’

Who would have known

Can’t Lovin’ Be Fun

Would be sung by everybody under the sun



You know it made the top ten

All good things come to an end

I wish they’d play it again and again

They keep on playin’

Oh God I’m prayin’

They’ll keep playing my song



Oh ho they’re playing my song



VERNON

Oh yeah they’re playing your song



SONIA

I wish they’d play it again and again

They keep on playin’

Oh God I’m prayin’

They’ll keep playing my song
