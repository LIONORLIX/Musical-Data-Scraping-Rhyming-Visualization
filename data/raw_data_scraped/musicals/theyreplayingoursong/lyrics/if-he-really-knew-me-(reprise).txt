If He Really Knew Me (Reprise)


VERNON

If she really knew me

If she really truly knew me

Maybe she would see the other side of me I hide of me



If there were no music

If my melodies stopped playing

Would I be the kind of man

She?d want to see tonight



SONIA

If he really knew me

If he'd take the time to understand

Maybe he could show me

Maybe he could find me

Maybe he?d remind me

Of who I am
