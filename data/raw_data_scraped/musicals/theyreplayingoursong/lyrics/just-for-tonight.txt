Just For Tonight


SONIA

Just for today let me love you

Just for tonight I’ll close my eyes

And when I open them my world will be alright

It couldn’t hurt anyone

It wouldn’t hurt anyone



Just for today I want to hold you

Just for tonight you’ll be my dream

And when the morning comes to wake me that’s alright

It couldn’t hurt anyone

It wouldn’t hurt anyone



Taking just one more chance

Tryin for some fun

Up to now my life’s been too much said too little done



Just for today

I’ll be my feelings

And I know

They’ll lead me home

And if we both come back a little wiser

It couldn’t hurt anyone

It wouldn’t hurt anyone

It shouldn’t hurt anyone

Just for tonight



Taking just one more chance

Tryin for some fun

Up to now my life’s been too much said too little done



Just for today

I’ll be my feelings

And I know

They’ll lead me home

And if we both come back a little wiser

It couldn’t hurt anyone

It wouldn’t hurt anyone

It shouldn’t hurt anyone

Just for tonight
