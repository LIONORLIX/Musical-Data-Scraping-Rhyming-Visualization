I need a little more time just for me



VERNON

SONIA

Workin’ it out, that’s what I’m tryin’ to do

Working it out  For Leon, for me and you

You never had to work it out

VERNON

SONIA

Work it out for two



VERNON

I hear a kind of BeeGees record here,

About broken hearts or something’

Something like



Look at the way he works

What would he know of a broken heart’



VERNON

Ooo give it to me mama



SONIA

To him broken heart is a phrase I should write for his God damn middle part



VERNON

You’ll fill it in here



SONIA

He’s askin’ me for words that are clever

Leon and me we had five years together

I need a little more time



FEMALE ALTER EGOS

VERNON

Here’s where my boys come in



MALE ALTER EGOS

He took my lyric kept my title

Threw out every word



VERNON

Baby!



SONIA

He made some crazy disco thing

It’s not at all the son I heard but



FEMALE ALTER EGOS

Maybe his way’s better



SONIA

Who knows I’m too unclear

Right now my mind’s in such a mess

I hardly know I’m here



VERNON

Hey baby!



MALE ALTER EGOS

Lalala



SONIA

Gotta find a lyric

Gotta give ya somethin’



FEMALE ALTER EGOS

Tell him ‘you were right dear



SONIA

If someone else had written this I’d know just what to say

I’d say it’s not my kind of song can’t we write something else today but



FEMALE ALTER EGOS

He might get insulted



SONIA

His ego isn’t small



FEMALE ALTER EGOS

If you don’t write him something quick

We might not work at all



SONIA

I’ve got to work it out

Help me work it out



VERNON

The music is great, now it’s onto you



SONIA

Try even harder that’s all I can do

You never had to work it out



VERNON

SONIA

Work it out for two
