When You're In My Arms


VERNON

When you’re in my arms

And I feel you close to me

Life’s what it’s supposed to be

I’m in love you are my soul



SONIA

You’re my melody

You’re every dream I locked away



VERNON & SONIA

My whole world came alive the day

You walked into my life

You are my song

Sing it

Let everybody know I found you

Let everybody know I found that thing

That people love to sing about

Tell them

Tell them if they didn’t hear by now

Tell them how I’ve found that feeling that I waited for

I’ve got the world and more



VERNON

When you’re in my arms I wish I had the words to say



SONIA

I’ll give them to you every day



VERNON & SONIA

Tonight you’re in my arms

It feels good in your arms

Tonight you’re in my arms



FEMALE ALTER EGOS

When you’re in love the time keeps tickin’ but you’ve go no time to see it go



VERNON

I’ve only got eyes for my sweet sweet baby so love’s the only time I know



FEMALE ALTER EGOS

When you’re in love your smile gets wider you get a kind of magic glow

The clock on the wall doesn’t matter at all cause love’s the only time you know



Something so right like lovin’ together

Two hearts are better than one

Good good lovin’ that some sweet sweet music

Sure makes wakin’ up fun

Sure feels good to be lovin’ each other

I wonder why we waited so long

Sonia and Vernon

The fire is burnin’

We got ourselves our own sweet song



VERNON & SONIA

When you’re in my arms I see a world I’ve never seen



VERNON

I never knew that trees were green



VERNON & SONIA

Till you were in my arms

You are my song

Sing it

Let everybody know I found you

Let everybody know I found that thing

That people love to sing about

Thank you

For helping give my life some order

VERNON

And where’d you put my tape record

I want to write how good I feel tonight



VERNON & SONIA

When you’re in my arms



VERNON

I wish I had the words somehow



SONIA

Shhh

Not now



VERNON & SONIA

Tonight you’re in my arms

And you’ll be wakin’ up in my arms

When you’re in my arms
