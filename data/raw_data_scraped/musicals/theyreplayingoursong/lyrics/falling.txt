Falling


I’m afraid to fly

And I don’t know why

I’m jealous of the people who

are not afraid to die

It’s just  that I recall

Back when I was small

Someone promised that they’d catch me

And then they let me fall



And now I’m fallin’

Fallin’ fast again

Why do I always take a fall

When I fall in Love’



You think by now I’d learn

Play with fire you get burned

But fire can be oh so warm

And that’s why I returned

Turn and walk away

That’s what I should do

My head says turn and walk away

My heart says I love you.



And now I’m fallin’

Fallin’ fast again

Why do I always take a fall

When I fall in Love’



Always turns out the same

Lovin’ someone

Confusin’ myself

Only got me to nlame

Helkp me I’m fallin Fallin

Catch me if you can

Maybe this time I’ll have it all

Maybe I’ll make it after all

Maybe this time I won’t fall

When I fall in love.
