We've Got Girls


Andy:

Do you ever wonder where the females going

When ?round at the ball realize you?re flying solo

Too bad for you because they?re here with me

Waiting in line until we mambo horizontally



Will:

Do you ever wonder where he gets this shit

Or if any of his skanks that he bangs believe a word of it

He isn?t anybody?s Mister Right

I?m the one the ladies want for more than just a night



Andy:

Don?t listen to a word he says

He hasn?t be kissed since Truth or Dare



Will:

How do you know that?s true

When I?m with girls I don?t think you?re there

I see what they wanna hear

And you don?t know ?cause you don?t care

I?ve got girls by the balls



Andy:

(Spoken) What?



Will:

I figure them out and I got ?m up against the wall



Andy:

You?ve got nothing at all

You?re making this up

You have to hide in a woman?s bathroom dorm to get a girl near your balls



Andy:

(Spoken) Don?t lie Will. It makes you look bad



Will:

(Spoken) Yeah, I never used to get any

But things change, Andy. Things change!



When high school girls were out of my league and I knew it

One awkward glance or they?d see me dance and I blew it

But college girls are much more my style



Andy:

?Cause they?re Jewish

All they do is make you and your Jew balls blewish



Will:

It?s too bad he?s an idiot

He might get some if he got to class



Andy:

I never needed it

I know my style and can still kick your ass



Both:

You are the opposite of me

I?m more than happy to agree



Jack (or Skip):

(Spoken) You guys are nuts! Don?t you want nice saying things like love?



Will:                   Andy:

Of course we wanna be in love

And we?re looking for romance

But, dude if I?m not holding off        Pun tang!

We?ll just get into their pants         Pun tang!



Both:

We?ve got girls by the balls

They?re looking for love

But that?s not what we?re making at all



We?ve got girls by the balls

And we?re holding on

It?s time for every girl to be grabbed



Will:                   Andy:

By the balls                    How do you win the play always

By the balls                    Where do we like a pretty girl?s face

By the balls                    Where do we have Jack?s mum

By the



Jack:

(Spoken) Fuck you guys!



Will:

(Spoken) balls?



Both:

Balls!
