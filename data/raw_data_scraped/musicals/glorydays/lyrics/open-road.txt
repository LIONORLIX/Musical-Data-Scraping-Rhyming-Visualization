Open Road


Jack:



Well, I took a month off from school

And decided to go on a trip

So I pack my bags and kissed my mom goodbye



And I got into my car

What a lousy piece of shit

But I didn't care 'cause I just needed to try

And go driving down the coast

In the nice days or the rain

I wore the same clothes

And got food on the go



I tore around those curves

Just speeding through the plains

Sometimes I went so fast I wanted to explode



Cause it was just me and the Open Road



I stopped at all the parks

And slept under the sky

And when I woke

I drove the rest of the day



I took shortcuts through people's yards

And ran my gas tank close to dry

And when I sped by cops

I knew just what to say

After the fourteenth time



When I was driving through the East

And my windows rolled down low

There was so much air that I could hardly breathe



I taught myself the land

From the Blue Ridge to Poconos

I became an expert on how the traffic flowed

I loved my life alone on the Open Road



But then I met this kid

Who wanted to go cross country like I did

But wouldn't hitch cause he had too much pride

So I offered him a ride



We learned about each other's lives

As we talked all through the night

And when he thought the time was right

He kissed me in the car

Beneath the starless sky

And with that kiss

He opened up my mind

And we went driving

We were driving



We were driving



Just me

A beautiful boy

And the Open Road
