My Three Best Friends


Will:

Look at this field, look at this perfect field

The possibilities are endless here

Just white lines, no boundaries to hold us here

Except for time and so much history

Imagine what has happened here   All the stories

Games that have been won

And friends having fun

Coming back for one perfect night

Right here



This is the story of four best friends

Who were in one place and night never ends

We talk about things that matter and then

In the same way act like we?re ten

And then do it all over again



We?re from, just imagine this kind of town

Where the popular click keeps you down

We can put on pads and make caveman sounds

As you knock smaller kids than you to the ground

Doesn?t that sound fun to be around



We were never big enough and fast enough

To keep up with all of them

But we were always smart enough and quick enough

To know we?d be better in the end



Then the seniors from the football team

Who wouldn?t let us play

We couldn?t catch or run as fast

So they told we were gay



They try to make us worship them

But we like things our way

Just me and my three best friends



Skip is a cynic a Jack?s the voice of reason

And Andy?s the reason that Skip is a cynic

The bickering brothers, it?s sick

It?s like the boiling water couldn?t mix

There?s something about us that just clicks



?Cause I am the glue that holds us together

Observer, inventor and soul documenter

Constantly watching and constant in senate

To keep moving forward and always remember

Where we started from and how far we?ve come

Since the day that we had no one

But we formed this perfect union

And an era had begun



We get this life so differently

Than anyone our age chooses to see

Me and my three best friends



Your best friends open up your mind

To parts of you, you couldn?t find

They saved my life freshman year

And I thank them everyday, right here



We?ve been away for way too long

And all that time alone felt wrong

?Cause we belong right here



And we?re coming back tonight

To remember what we were like

And pick up right where we let go

Almost a year ago



I know this story so well

And it is mine to tell

Because it is happening to me

And my three

Yeah me and my three

Yeah me and my three best friends
