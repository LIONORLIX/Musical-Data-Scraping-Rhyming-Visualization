The Thing About Andy


Will:

He's never been like us

That's been clear since back then

So the fact that he changed without telling us when

Is not too surprising

Cause it's always been clear

That there's something going on

Here with Andy



The thing about Andy

Is how close we are to him

And how much we still don't know



Andy, the thing about Andy

Is why he shuts down so fast

And acts like he can't let go

So he won't have to show

The thing about



Jack:

Maybe the thing about Andy

Is he doesn't know himself

The way his best friends do

Maybe the truth is that Andy

Just isn't as smart as us

So how can we expect him to



Will:

Well maybe that's not true

And we don't know Andy



Jack:

But how can that be

He's still the person who we stood next to

Since we were kids



Will:

Well obviously the best friend you though you knew

Would never do what he just did



Will and Jack:

It's embarrassing that we can



Jack:

Look and not see

Will:

Look so hard and still not see



Jack:

What someone else could feel for you



Will:

When you don't make a move



Jack:

What fake friends say and real friends do



Will:

It's just another way to prove



Will and Jack:

That I never really knew



Will:

A thing about Andy

The thing about Andy

Is how much he doesn't get

The work that a best friend does



Jack:

Andy, the thing about Andy

Is he's better friends with us

Than we are to him

Because



Will and Jack:

There never really was

A thing about Andy
