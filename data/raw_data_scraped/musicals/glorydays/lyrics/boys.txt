Boys


Will:

When we were boys

We had fun

And blamed mistakes

On being human



And now we're old

And even one

With good intent

Has power to ruin



You know I'm trying to be a man

But this is a part of it

That I don't understand



All of my memories from being a kid

Are filled with things that all of us did

When we were younger we were so sure

That we'd never stop being boys

Anymore



Skip:

I don't know who

You think is dead

You're whining like

Your life is over



Will:

It feels that way



Skip:

But no one said

You can't screw up

When you get older



Will:

We were so perfect until today



Skip:

But Andy's right

The good old days



Skip and Will:

Never Stay



All of my memories from being a kid

May have been changed by what we did

We aren't working like we did before



Skip:

But does that mean



Skip and Will:

We can't be boys anymore



Will:

I don't like this feeling

That I could be losing you



Skip:

Nobody is losing

Everyones just growing too



Will:

What if this was never right

And it took us until tonight

To realize this place was never home

And we were better off alone



Skip:

Don't fight to figure out

Something we'll all just laugh about

One Day



One Day



Skip and Will:

One Day



Will:

I am not ready

To stop being a kid



Skip:

Well nobody said

That was what you needed



Skip and Will:

We'll never be who we were before



Skip:

But never say we're not boys

Anymore



Will:

Anymore



Skip:

Anymore
