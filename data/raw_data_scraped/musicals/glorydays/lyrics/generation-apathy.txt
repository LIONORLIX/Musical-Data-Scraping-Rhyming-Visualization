Generation Apathy


Skip:

In a world that defines itself with

X's, Y2k's and Z's

You're pressin' for a third world war

That's real but you choose not to see

You don't care or ever dare

Outside of your complacency

But it's not just you

There's a new world order

Generation Apathy



We're just virgins who are burgeoning with readiness for more

But we've got pornos in our drawer

So we don't have to use the door



We feed a need not to bleed

Unless we're absolutely sure

We go through painstaking means to never feel pain anymore



We used to be young and stupid

But now we're just young

Cause we don't admit the stupid shit

We've done now that real life has begun



Our generations' way over-sexed and under-loved

And underwhelmed by all of the above



We complain about our perfect lives

With bigger words than most

We spew out facts and find it relaxin'

To talk shit as we boast

About me and me and me and me

Let's all raise a toast

To the generation that will turn the nation

From a super power into a ghost



Our father's are commuters

But we're stuck in our computers

Which take us all away from one another

But who cares



Cause we're too occupied to noticed what was there has died

Between families who used to love each other

Cause who cares



The problems that of the world we're in

Will always be right here

But rather than us fixing them

We'll join in with a cheer:

Who cares [x5]



Who cares



We may graduate with honors

But there's not honor in it

We are running a race but we're okay

If we don't win it



We are smart but we don't try

The "Do I have to" kind of guy

Who will never risk and never fail

If he spin it



Chivalry and bravery

The qualities we used to be

Are now only a memory



And what I'm still wondering

Is what's the most expensive thing I can get for free



I feel bad but can't help the laughter

At the generation that comes after



Generation Apathy
