Right Here


Will:

When you were young

Didn?t you have dreams

That you let go off

?Cause somebody told you

That you weren?t allowed to dream the way you do

Just ?cause you were different



Like when I was twelve

I bought myself some L.A. lights

Remember those shoes you could see at night

?Cause Bryan Noonan ruled

And he wore them to school

And I hated him, but I wanted to be cool



And when I got to ninth grade

I really thought if I made the football team

They wouldn?t be mean

But I could never have seen

What being cut from a team

Would mean to me



?Cause right here was the first place I felt home

With no fear of my life spend all alone

It was clear under these electric stars

No matter what they said from over there

This field was ours right here



Skip:

(Spoken) Well, that?s touching.



Will:

(Spoken) Come on man! You used to love this stuff!



Skip:

(Spoken) I used to. I like to think I have changed a little since I left this place.



Will:

(Spoken) No! This place made us who we are!



Skip:

Did you think you?d never change

You?d just stay in some epic strange yearbook moment

Except you moved away

And you can pray that they?ll stay

But the good old days say goodbye

And sorry you?re different



Will:

No! Cause we?re still young

And though you may have tried to bid our lives

of the cool people?s bullshit



Andy:

Yeah!



Will:

The bruises to proof it



Andy:

What he says!



Will:

Stung are still here



Andy & Will:

Cause we?re still different



Jack:

Oh, please, just let it be

Cause no one?s making sense right now

Yes we?ve changed, I?m not sure how

But I don?t care what it took me to get me here from there

I?m maybe different, but I still mean I swear.



Will:

I know you?re right   So am I

We can change but we can?t deny

We?ll always be the guys we were when we met.

And back when we began it

We didn?t plan it



Andy & Will:

But we can?t forget



Andy:

Right here was the first place you felt home

With no fear of a life spend all alone



Will:

No fear of a life spend all alone



Andy & Will:

Cause it?s clear under these electric stars



Andy, Will & Jack:

No matter what you say from over there



Will:   Others:

This is ours    Ours

Right   Right



Skip:

Here was the first place I felt home

With no fear of my life spend all alone



Will:                   Others:

It?s clear under these electric stars   It?s clear



All:

It doesn?t matter what they say over there

Cause this is ours right

Here



Will:

Here was a better place than home

Cause it?s clear that we?ll never be alone



All:

This is our home



This year under these electric stars

No matter what they say from over there



Will:

We?ll still be



All:

Right here!
