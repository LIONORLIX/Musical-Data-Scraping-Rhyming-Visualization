Priya

A movie star must look the part

That's why it's called performing art

You have to work out every day

A camera's never far away



You must develop cool mystique

A boyish charm, a fine physique

You have to work until you drop

That's how you reach the top

Are you quite sure you want to be famous?

Famous



Akaash

There's nothing with how I look

Well, not much anyway

Life's much tougher in the slum

So please help me to become famous



Priya

The public want their stars to be

Part hero and part fantasy

A poet who can play the clown

A leader who will not back down



A perfect love, a __ son

A role model for everyone

A man who still finds time to pray

And never goes astray

Are you quite sure you want to be famous?

Famous



Akaash

Okay, I'll try to play the part

If you watch over me



Priya

You'll need more than me to hold your hand

'Cause it is not a picnic being famous

Famous, famous, famous
