Journey Home


Akaash

The journey home

Is never too long

Your heart arrives before the train

The journey home

Is never too long

Some yesterdays always remain

I'm going back to where my heart was light

When my pillow was a ship I sailed through the night



The journey home

Is never too long

When open arms are waiting there

The journey home

Is never too long

There's room to love and room to spare

I want to feel the way that I did then

I'll think my wishes through before I wish again



Not every road you come across

Is one you have to take

No, sometimes standing still can be

The best move you ever make



The journey home

Is never too long

One helps to heal the deepest pain

The journey home

Is never too long

Your heart arrives before the train
