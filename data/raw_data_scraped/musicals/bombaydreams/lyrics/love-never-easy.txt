Love Never Easy


Sweetie

Love's never easy

Take it from a girl who knows

Love comes as quickly as it goes

Love's never easy

Always moments of despair

And we girls get more than our share



All we women want of life

Is to find a man who's kind and true

We have seen life through men's eyes

So we know what pleases you



Love's never easy

You will learn this lesson too

I'll be here for you when you do

Love's never easy

One day soon the dream will start

Well, that is what I tell my heart



All we women want of life

Is to find a man who's kind and true

We have seen life through men's eyes

So we know what pleases you



Love's never easy

Take it from a girl who knows

Love comes as quickly as it goes

Love's never easy

One day soon the dream will start

Well, that is what I tell my heart



Love's never easy
