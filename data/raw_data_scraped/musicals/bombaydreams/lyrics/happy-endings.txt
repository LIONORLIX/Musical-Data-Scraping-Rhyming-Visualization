Happy Endings


Priya

Happy ending's all you know

Sing and dance your life away

It's time you realized

Real life is black and white

And heroes don't fly

Sometimes they cry



Times are changing for the better

Out there is a new Bombay

Human struggle, gritty drama

Stories with something to say



Your head's been in the clouds

Since I was a little girl

You brought me clothes to wear

But were never there



Madan

Your life has been one big parade

Because of all the deals I made

Yes, it's true, I had to mix

With men who are corrupt

But that's what you do

And so will you



Priya

Educating, stimulating

That's how movies could be



Madan

Gangsters lying, mothers crying

That's how movies should be



Priya

Motivating, penetrating

That's how movies could be



Madan

Heroes flying, villains dying

That's how movies could be



Priya

Happy ending's all you know



Madan

What's so wrong with happy endings?

Chance for people to escape



Priya

There are those who want to learn

There are those who like to think

And not every one

Lives to have fun



Happy ending's all you know
