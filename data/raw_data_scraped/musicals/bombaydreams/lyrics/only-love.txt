Only Love


Priya

Only love, it's only love

I've never felt like this before

Only love, it's only love

This is a feeling I can't ignore



Only love, it's only love

This music that's playing inside my head

Only love, I know it's love

Without a word ever being said



Something strange has happened here

I'm no longer free

I can't get you off my mind

What is wrong with me?



All my dreams were spoken for

Then you came along and I dreamed one more

Only love, it's only love

Feel like I'm floating above the moon

Only love, it's only love

I think I'll die if we don't kiss soon
