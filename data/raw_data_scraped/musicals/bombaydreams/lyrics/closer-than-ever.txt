Closer Than Ever


Priya

There'll come a morning

When we'll awaken

Closer than ever

Slowly but surely

Sooner or later

Closer than ever

Breathing the same air

Dreaming the same dreams

Closer than ever before



Priya & Akaash

There'll come a moment

When I will hold you

Closer than ever

Fairy-tale romance

Princess and hero

Closer than ever

Like an old movie

Where strangers end up

Closer than ever before



Akaash

All of a sudden

Just like a shower

Our love will flower

Life will have meaning



Priya

Worth living for



Akaash

Worth living for



Priya

Worth dying for



Akaash

Worth dying for



Both

There'll come a morning

When we'll awaken

Closer than ever before



Priya

Closer than ever



Both

Before
