Praise the god who smiles on Bombay

Give me a land free from the flood

Saving the hovels made of mud

Lifting the heart

Cleansing the mind

Testing the conscience of mankind



Salaam Bombay

Here's to everything in Bombay

Here's to the poor

And the oppressed

Who have to die before they're blessed
