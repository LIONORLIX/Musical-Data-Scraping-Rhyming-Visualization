How Many Stars


Akaash

How many stars have to shine

Before your eyes meet mine?

How many stars must I see

Before you dream like me?



Priya

How many tides have to turn

Before you turn to me?

How many stars have to shine

Before my heart is free?



Akaash

How many stars?



Priya

How many stars have to shine

Before your hands hold mine?

How many stars must I see

Before you come to me?



Akaash

How many tides have to turn

Before you turn my way?



Priya

How many stars have to shine

Before you say you'll stay?



Akaash

Everyone needs a sense of belonging

Someone there who always understands

That precious gifts can come from empty hands



Priya

Precious gifts can come from empty hands



Akaash

How many stars have to shine

Before we find our way?



Both

How many stars have to shine





Akaash

Before we love each day?



Both

How many stars have to shine





Akaash

Before we find our way?



Both

How many stars have to shine





Akaash

Before we love?



Priya

How many stars?
