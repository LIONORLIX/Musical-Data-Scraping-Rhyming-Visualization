Like an Eagle


Akaash

There's a place where I can take you

You will not believe your eyes

It's the journey of a lifetime

Where imagination flies

If you believe

Watch me step into my dream



Like the eagle

Was born to fly

Right across the open sky

I was born

To be seen on a screen

In Bollywood



Everybody has their moment

When their world begins to shine

Got to keep the fire inside you

Everything will turn out fine

If you believe

Watch me step into my dream



Like the eagle

Was born to fly

Right across the open sky

I was born

To be seen on a screen

In Bollywood



Like the eagle

Was born to soar

High above the ocean's roar

I was born

To believe in the dream

Of Bollywood



Like the eagle

Was born to fly

Right across the open sky

I was born

To be seen on a screen

In Bollywood



Like the eagle

Was born to soar

High above the ocean's roar

I was born

To believe in the dream

Of Bollywood



I was born

To change the face

Of Bollywood
