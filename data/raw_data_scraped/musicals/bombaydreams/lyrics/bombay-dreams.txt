Bombay Dreams


Sunrise, burning heat

Nothing is as travelled as a Bombay street

Contradictions, city of extremes

Anything is possible in Bombay dreams

Some live and die in debt

Others making millions on the Internet

Contradictions, city of extremes

Anything is possible in Bombay dreams



This __ is coming! Hip hip hooray!

CNN cameras are here in Bombay

The slums have to be painted right away

Or next year __ will come from L.A.!



We eunuchs bring you luck

Give us money, you will see

I can change your fortune

If you are kind to me

But if you refuse us

You'll face adversity

Even though we're not

The men we used to be



Life's never easy

Every day you struggle through

You lean on me

I lean on you



Life's never easy

Every day's an uphill fight

Prayers are ignored(?)

But we're all right
