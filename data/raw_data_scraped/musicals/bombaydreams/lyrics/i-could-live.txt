I Could Live


Akaash

It's the kind of place I've been looking for

No one seems to build like this any more

I would feel at home

It would feel so good

Don't think I could find a better neighbourhood



Wouldn't need to bring any packing case

Once I settled in, I'd never leave this place

This would suit me fine

I'd be satisfied

I'd feel like a king once I was inside



I could live here

I could live here

I could live here

I could live here
