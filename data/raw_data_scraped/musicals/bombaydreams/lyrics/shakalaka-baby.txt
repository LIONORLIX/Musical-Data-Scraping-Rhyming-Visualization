Shakalaka Baby


Shakalaka baby, shakalaka baby

Shakalaka baby, shakalaka baby



Saw your face and the damage was done

You waked a spell that took me over

A brighter bulb right out of the sun

A lotus scented supernova



Catch the rythem, jump to the beat

The nights are warm and my words are tender

Can't escape, feel the heat

Lose yourself and the sweet surrender



(Woah-oh-oh-oh)

And the planets are colliding

(Woah-oh-oh-oh)

Fantasies are flying

(Woah-oh)

Simply no denying

There you are my Bombay lover...



Shakalaka baby, shakalaka baby

This is how it's really meant to be

Shakalaka baby, shakalaka baby

Come and shakalaka with me

Shakalaka baby, shakalaka baby

Nothing here is ever what it seems

Shakalaka baby, shakalaka baby

Let me take you with me in my dreams



No no no no no no no no no x4



In a trance going out of my mind

You made a flame that keeps me burning

Come on baby, give me a sign

One look from you and the world stops turning



(Woah-oh-oh-oh)

Music gets exciting

(Woah-oh-oh-oh)

I need you here beside me

(Woah-oh)

I know you'll satisfy me

There you are my Bombay lover...



Shakalaka baby, shakalaka baby

This is how it's really meant to be

Shakalaka baby, shakalaka baby

Come and shakalaka with me

Shakalaka baby, shakalaka baby

I just wanna love you everyday

Shakalaka baby, shakalaka baby

Promise me you'll never go away



No no no no no no no no no x4



Secret moon and enchanted dreams

Pray we share many nights like these

Million stars in the sky...



Oh oh, oh oh



Shakalaka baby, shakalaka baby

Shakalaka baby, shakalaka baby

Shakalaka baby, shakalaka baby

This is how it's really meant to be

Shakalaka baby, shakalaka baby

Come and shakalaka with me

Shakalaka baby, shakalaka baby

Loving you is all I need to know

Shakalaka baby, shakalaka baby

Now you're here I'll never let you go
