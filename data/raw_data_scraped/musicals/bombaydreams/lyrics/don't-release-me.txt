Don't Release Me


Madan

You said I would rot in jail

And you'd throw the key away

I feel safer behind bars

I'll have time to write my memoirs

I'm a monster, I'm a beast

I should never, never be released

I have rigged a mongoose fight

And smoked a cigar on an Air India flight



Don't release me

Don't release me

Don't release me

Don't set me free

Don't release me

Don't release me

Don't release me

Don't set him free



I'm too bad to be let out

There's things you don't know about

Want a passport? Talk to me

I have a warehouse full of duty free



Don't release me

Don't release me

Don't release me

Don't set me free

Don't release me

Don't release me

Don't release me

Don't set him free



Living in this place does suit me

No one here's trying to shoot me

I'll give you movie masterpieces

Like my previous releases

When my next one's in the can

It'll be bigger than Star Wars or Spiderman



Throw away the key

Don't set him free



Don't release me

Don't release me

Don't release me

Don't set me free

Don't release me

Don't release me

Don't release me

Don't set him free
