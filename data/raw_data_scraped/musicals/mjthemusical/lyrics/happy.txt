Happy


Sadness had been

Close as my next of kin

Then happy came one day

Chased my blues away

My life began when happy smiled

Sweet, like candy to a child

Stay here and love me just a while

Let sadness see what happy does

Let happy be where sadness was

Happy, that's you

You made my life brand new

Lost as a little lamb, was I

'Til you came in

My life began when happy smiled

Sweet, like candy to a child

Stay here and love me just a while

Let sadness see what happy does

Let happy be where sadness was ('til now)

Where have I been?

What lifetime was I in?

Suspended between time and space

Lonely until

Happy came smiling up at me

Sadness had no choice but to flee

I said a prayer so silently

Let sadness see what happy does

Let happy be where sadness was 'til now

Happy

Yeah, yeah, happy

La la la la, la la la

Yeah, happy

Ooh, happy

La la la la, la la la

Happy

Oh yeah, happy

La la la la, la la la
