Leave Me Alone


Aaow

Hoo-hoo

I don't care what you talkin' bout, baby

I don't care what you say

Don't you come walkin' beggin' back mama

I don't care anyway

Time after time I gave you all of my money

No excuses to make

Ain't no mountain that I can't climb, baby

All is going my way

Who's laughing, baby?

Don't you know

(And there's the choice that we make)

(And this choice you will take)

Who's laughin', baby?

So just leave me alone

(Leave me alone, leave me alone)

Leave me alone

Leave me alone

(Leave me alone, leave me alone, leave me alone)

Leave me alone

Stop it

Just stop doggin' me around

There was a time I used to say, "Girl, I need you"

But who is sorry now?

You really hurt, you used to take and deceive me

Now who is sorry now?

You got a way of making me feel so sorry

I found out right away

Don't you come walkin' beggin' I ain't lovin' you

Don't you get in my way

Who's laughing, baby?

Don't you know

(And there's the choice that we make)

(And this choice you will take)

Who's laughin', baby?

So just leave me alone

(Leave me alone, leave me alone)

Leave me alone

Leave me alone

(Leave me alone, leave me alone, leave me alone)

Leave me alone

Stop it

Just stop doggin' me around

Who's laughing, baby?

Don't you know

(And there's the choice that we make)

(And this choice you will take)

Who's laughin', baby?

So just leave me alone

(Leave me alone, leave me alone)

Leave me alone

Leave me alone

(Leave me alone, leave me alone, leave me alone)

Leave me alone

Stop it

Just stop doggin' me around

Leave me alone

Leave me alone

(Leave me alone, leave me alone, leave me alone)

Leave me alone

Stop it

Just stop doggin' me around

Don't come beggin' me

Don't come beggin'

Don't come lovin' me

Don't come beggin'

I love you

I don't want it

I don't

I don't

I don't

I, I, I, I

Aaow

Don't come beggin' me

Don't come beggin'

Don't come lovin' me

Don't come beggin'

I love you

I don't want it

I don't need it

I don't
