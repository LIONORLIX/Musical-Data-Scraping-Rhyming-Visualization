Johnny Raven


Free and untamed

That's how I've grown

(He's Johnny Raven)

Settling down ain't my nature

Roots I'll never own

(He's Johnny Raven)

Oh your smile

Mm, mm

But tell me, angel child

How can you cage a bird

Born to be wild

I'm Johnny Raven

(He's Johnny Raven)

By and by

Oh, I'm going to leave your nest girl

Another nest to try

Ooh Johnny Raven

Girl you know I shouldn't have loved you

Yeah, but I gotta leave you

When my restless heart says goodbye

Look at you little girl

You feel love so deep

Yeah, yeah

If I could change in a second

I'd change for you like that

Stay right here for keeps

But I'm home free for no thrills

Stray I will

Seems I gotta need one girl

Never can feel

Yeah I'm Johnny Raven

(He's Johnny Raven)

By and by

(By and by)

I'm going to leave your nest girl

Another nest to try

Ooh Johnny Raven

Girl you know I shouldn't have loved you

Yeah, but I gotta leave you

When my restless heart says goodbye

Everybody knows my name

I'm Johnny Raven yeah, yeah, by and by

(He's Johnny Raven)

Ooh, I'm gonna fly

When you cry part of me's gonna die

(Ooh, ooh)

Ooh, I'm Johnny Raven, yeah, yeah

By and by

I'm gonna fly, and when you cry, yeah

A part of me's gonna die

(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

(Johnny, Johnny, Johnny)

(He's Johnny Raven)

(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

(Johnny, Johnny, Johnny)

(He's Johnny Raven)

(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

(Johnny, Johnny, Johnny)

(He's Johnny Raven)

(Ooh, ooh, ooh...)
