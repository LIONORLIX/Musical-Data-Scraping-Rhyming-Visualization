Perpetual Anticipation


MRS. NORDSTROM:

Perpetual anticipation is good for the soul

But it's bad for the heart.

It's very good for practicing self-control,

It's very good for morals, but bad for morale.

It's very bad.

It can lead to going quite mad.

It's very good for reserve and learning to do what one should.

It's very good.

Perpetual anticipation's a delicate art,

Playing a role,

Aching to start,

Keeping control

While falling apart.

Perpetual anticipation is good for the soul

But it's bad for the heart.



MRS. SEGSTROM:

Perpetual anticipation is good for the soul

But it's bad for the heart.

It's very good for practicing self-control,

It's very good for morals, but bad for morale.

It's too unnerving.

It's very good, though, to have things to contemplate.

Perpetual anticipation's a delicate art,

Aching to start,

Keeping control

While falling apart.

Perpetual anticipation is good for the soul

But it's bad for the heart.



MRS. ANDERSSEN:

Perpetual anticipation is good for the soul

But it's bad for the heart.

It's very good, though, to learn to wait.

Perpetual anticipation's a delicate art,

Keeping control

While falling apart.

Perpetual anticipation is bad for the heart.
