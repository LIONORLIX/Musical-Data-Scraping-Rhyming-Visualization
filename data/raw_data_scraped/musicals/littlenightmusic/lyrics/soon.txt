Soon


ANNE:

Soon, I promise,

Soon, I won't shy away,

Dear old--

Soon, I want to.

Soon, whatever you say.

Even now,

When you're close and we touch,

And you're kissing my brow,

I don't mind it too much.

And you'll have to admit I'm endearing,

I help keep things humming,

I'm not domineering--

What's one small shortcoming?

And think of how I adore you,

Think of how much you love me.

If I were perfect for you,

Wouldn't you tire of me

Soon,

All too soon,

Dear old--
