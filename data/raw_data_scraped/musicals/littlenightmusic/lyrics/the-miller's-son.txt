The Miller's Son


PETRA:

I shall marry the miller's son,

Pin my hat on a nice piece of property.

Friday nights, for a bit of fun,

We'll go dancing.

Meanwhile...



It's a wink and a wiggle and a giggle in the grass

And I'll trip the light fandango,

A pinch and a diddle in the middle of what passes by.

It's a very short road

From the pinch and the punch

To the paunch and the pouch

And the pension.

It's a very short road

To the ten thousandth lunch

And the belch and the grouch

And the sigh.

In the meanwhile,

There are mouths to be kissed

Before mouths to be fed,

And a lot in between

In the meanwhile.

And a girl ought to celebrate what passes by.



Or I shall marry the businessman,

Five fat babies and lots of security.

Friday nights, if we think we can,

We'll go dancing.

Meanwhile...



It's a push and a fumble and a tumble in the sheets

And I'll foot the highland fancy,

A dip in the butter and a flutter with what meets my eye.

It's a very short fetch

From the push and the whoop

To the squint and the stoop

And the mumble.

It's not much of a stretch

To the cribs and the croup

And the bosoms that droop

And go dry.

In the meanwhile,

There are mouths to be kissed

Before mouths to be fed,

And there's many a tryst

And there's many a bed

To be sampled and seen

In the meanwhile.

And a girl has to celebrate what passes by.



Or I shall marry the Prince of Wales,

Pearls and servants and dressing for festivals.

Friday nights, with him all in tails,

We'll have dancing.

Meanwhile...



It's a rip in the bustle and a rustle in the hay

And I'll pitch the quick fantastic,

With flings of confetti and my petticoats away up high.

It's a very short way

From the fling that's for fun

To the thigh pressing un-

Der the table.

It's a very short day

Till you're stuck with just one

Or it has to be done

On the sly.

In the meanwhile,

There are mouths to be kissed

Before mouths to be fed,

And there's many a tryst

And there's many a bed,

There's a lot I'll have missed

But I'll not have been dead

When I die!

And a person should celebrate everything

Passing by.



And I shall marry the miller's son...
