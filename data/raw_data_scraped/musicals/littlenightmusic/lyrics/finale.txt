DESIREE:

What a surprise.

Who could foresee?

I'd come to feel about you

What you felt about me?

Why only now when I see that you've drifted away?

What a surprise.

What a clich√©.



Isn't it rich?



FREDRIK:

Are we a pair?

You here at last on the ground.



DESIREE:

You in mid-air.

Was that a farce?



FREDRIK:

My fault, I fear.



DESIREE:

Me as a merry-go-round.



FREDRIK:

Me as King Lear.

Make way for the clowns.



DESIREE:

Applause for the clowns.



FREDRIK & DESIREE:

They're finally here.
