Remember?


MR. LINDQUIST:

Remember?



MRS. NORDSTROM:

Remember?

The old deserted beach that we walked--

Remember?



MR. LINDQUIST:

Remember?

The cafe in the park where we talked--

Remember?



MRS. NORDSTROM:

Remember?



MR. LINDQUIST:

The tenor on the boat that we chartered,

Belching "The Bartered Bride"--



BOTH:

Ah, how we laughed! Ah, how we cried!



MR. LINDQUIST:

Ah, how you promised, and ah, how I lied.



MRS. NORDSTROM:

That dilapidated in--

Remember, darling?



MR. LINDQUIST:

The proprietess's grin,

Also her glare.



MRS. NORDSTROM:

Yellow gingham on the bed--

Remember, darling?



MR. LINDQUIST:

And the canopy in red,

Needing repair.



BOTH:

I think you were there.



MRS. NORDSTROM:

The local village dance on the green--

Remember?



MR. LINDQUIST:

Remember?

The lady with the large tambourine--

Remember?



MRS. NORDSTROM:

The one who played the harp in her boa

Thought she was so adept.



BOTH:

Ah, how we laughed! Ah, how we wept!

Ah, how we polka'd--



MRS. NORDSTROM:

And ah, how we slept!

How we kissed and how we clung--

Remember, darling?



MR. LINDQUIST:

We were foolish, we were young--



BOTH:

More than we knew.



MRS. NORDSTROM:

Yellow gingham on the bed,

Remember, darling?

And the canopy in red--



MR. LINDQUIST:

Or was it blue?



MRS. SEGSTROM:

The funny little games that we played--

Remember?



MR. ERLANSEN:

Remember?

The unexpected knock of the maid--

Remember?



MRS. ANDERSSEN:

Remember?

The wine that made us both rather merry

And oh so very frank--



ALL:

Ah, how we laughed! Ah, how we drank!



MR. ERLANSEN:

You acquiesced--



MRS. ANDERSSEN:

And the rest

Is a blank.



MR. LINDQUIST:

What we did with your perfume--



MR. ERLANSEN:

Remember, darling?



MRS. SEGSTROM:

The condition of the room

When we were through...



MRS. NORDSTROM:

Our inventions were unique--

Remember, darling?



MR. LINDQUIST:

I was limping for a week,

You caught the flu.



ALL:

I'm sure it was...you.
