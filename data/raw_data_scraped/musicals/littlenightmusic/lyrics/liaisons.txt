Liaisons


MME. ARMFELDT:

At the villa of the Baron De Signac,

Where I spent a somewhat infamous year,

At the villa of the Baron De Signac

I had ladies in attendance,

Fire-opal pendants...



Liaisons! What's happened to them?

Liaisons today.

Disgraceful! What's become of them?

Some of them

Hardly pay their shoddy way.



What once was a rare champagne

Is now just an amiable hock,

What once was a villa, at least,

Is "digs."

What once was a gown with train

Is now just a simple little frock,

What once was a sumptuous feast

Is figs.

No--not even figs--raisins!

Ah, liaisons!

Now, where was I? Where was I? Oh, yes...



At the palace of the Duke of Ferrara,

Who was prematurely deaf but a dear,

At the palace of the Duke of Ferrara

I acquired some position

Plus a tiny Titian...



Liaisons! What's happened to them?

Liaisons today.

To see them--indiscriminate

Women, it

Pains me more than I can say,

The lack of taste that they display!



Where is style?

Where is skill?

Where is forethought?

Where's discretion of the heart?

Where's passion in the art?

Where's craft?

With a smile

And a will

But with more thought,

I acquired a chateau

Extravagantly o-

Verstaffed.



Too many people muddle sex

With mere desire,

And when emotion intervenes

The nets descend.

It should on no account perplex,

Or worse, inspire;

It's but a pleasurable means

To a measurable end.

Why does no one comprehend?

Let us hope this lunacy's just a trend.

Now where was I? Where was I? Oh, yes...



In the castle of the King of the Belgians,

(We would visit through a false chiffonier)

In the castle of the King of the Belgians

Who, when things got rather touchy,

Deeded me a duchy...



Liaisons! What's happened to them?

Liaisons today.

Untidy! Take my daughter, I

Taught her, I

Tried my best to point the way.

I even named her Desiree.



In a world where the kings are employers,

Where the amateur prevails

And delicacy fails

To pay,

In a world where the princes are lawyers,

What can anyone expect

Except to recollect

Lia....



[She falls asleep.]
