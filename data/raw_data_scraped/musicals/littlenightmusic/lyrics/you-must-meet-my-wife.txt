You Must Meet My Wife


FREDRIK:

She lightens my sadness,

She livens my days,

She bursts with a kind of madness

My well-ordered ways.

My happiest mistake, the ache of my life:

You must meet my wife.

She bubbles with pleasure,

She glows with surprise,

Disrupts my accustomed leisure

And ruffles my ties.

I don't know even now quite how it began.

You must meet my wife, my Anne.

One thousand whims to which I give in,

Since her smallest tear turns me ashen.

I never dreamed that I could live in

So completely demented, contented a fashion.

So sunlike, so winning,

So unlike a wife.

I do think that I'm beginning

To show signs of life.

Don't ask me how at my age one still can grow--

If you met my wife, you'd know.



DESIREE [speaking]: Dear Fredrik, I'm just longing to meet her. Sometime.



FREDRIK:

She sparkles...



DESIREE:

How pleasant.



FREDRIK:

She twinkles...



DESIREE:

How nice.



FREDRIK:

Her youth is a sort of present--



DESIREE:

Whatever the price.



FREDRIK:

The incandescent--what?--the--



DESIREE [offering a cigarette]:

Light?



FREDRIK:

--of my life.

You must meet my wife.



DESIREE:

Yes, I must. I really must. Now--



FREDRIK:

She flutters.



DESIREE:

How charming.



FREDRIK:

She twitters.



DESIREE:

My word!



FREDRIK:

She floats.



DESIREE:

Isn't that alarming?

What is she, a bird?



FREDRIK:

She makes me feel I'm--what?--



DESIREE:

A very old man.



FREDRIK:

Yes--no!



DESIREE:

No?



FREDRIK:

But--



DESIREE:

I must meet your Gertrude.



FREDRIK:

My Anne.



DESIREE:

Sorry--Anne.



FREDRIK:

She loves my voice, my walk, my mustache,

The cigar, in fact, that I'm smoking.

She'll watch me puff until it's just ash,

Then she'll save the cigar butt.



DESIREE:

Bizarre, but

You're joking.



FREDRIK:

She dotes on--



DESIREE:

Your dimple.



FREDRIK:

My snoring.



DESIREE:

How dear.



FREDRIK:

The point is, she's really simple.



DESIREE:

Yes, that much seems clear.



FREDRIK:

She gives me funny names--



DESIREE:

Like?



FREDRIK:

"Old Dry-as-Dust."



DESIREE:

Wouldn't she just?



FREDRIK:

You must meet my wife.



DESIREE:

Yes, I must, yes, I must.



FREDRIK:

A sea of whims that I submerge in,

Yet so loveable in repentance.

Unfortunately still a virgin,

But you can't force a flower--



DESIREE:

Don't finish that sentence!

She's monstrous!



FREDRIK:

She's frightened.



DESIREE:

Unfeeling!



FREDRIK:

Unversed.

She'd strike you as unenlightened--



DESIREE:

No, I'd strike her first.



FREDRIK:

Her reticence, her apprehension--



DESIREE:

Her crust!



FREDRIK:

No!



DESIREE:

Yes!



FREDRIK:

No!



DESIREE:

Fredrik!



FREDRIK:

You must meet my wife.



DESIREE:

Let me get my hat and my knife!



FREDRIK:

What was that?



DESIREE:

I must meet your wife.



FREDRIK: DESIREE:

Yes, you must. Yes, I must.
