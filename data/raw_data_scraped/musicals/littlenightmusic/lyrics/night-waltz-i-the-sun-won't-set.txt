Night Waltz I-The Sun Won't Set


MRS. ANDERSSEN

The sun sits low,

Diffusing its usual glow.

Five o'clock,

Twilight...

Vespers sound,

And it's six o'clock,

Twilight

All around.



QUINTET:

But the sun sits low,

As low as it's going to go.



MR. ERLANSEN:

Eight o'clock...



MR. LINDQUIST:

Twilight...



WOMEN:

How enthralling!



MR. ERLANSEN:

It's nine o'clock...



MR. LINDQUIST:

Twilight...



WOMEN:

Slowly crawling

Towards--



MR. ERLANSEN:

Ten o'clock...



MR. LINDQUIST:

Twilight...



WOMEN:

Crickets calling...



QUINTET:

The vespers ring,

The nightingale's waiting to sing,

The rest of us wait on a string.

Perpetual sunset

Is rather an unset-

Tling thing.



The sun won't set,

It's fruitless to hope or to fret,

It's dark as it's going to get.

The hands on the clock turn,

But don't sing a nocturne

Just yet.
