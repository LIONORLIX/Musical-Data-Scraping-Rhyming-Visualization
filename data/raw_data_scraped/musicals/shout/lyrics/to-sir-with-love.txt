To Sir With Love


Those school girl days of telling tales

And biting nails are gone

But in my mind I know

They will still live on and on



But how do you thank someone

Who has taken you from crayons to perfume?

It isn't easy, but I'll try



If you wanted the sky

I would write across the sky in letters

That would soar a thousand feet high

To Sir, with love



The time has come for closing books

And long last looks must end

And as I leave I know

That I am leaving my best friend



A friend who taught me right from wrong

And weak from strong

That's a lot to learn, what

can I give you in return?



If you wanted the moon

I would try to make a star

But I, would rather you let me give my heart

To Sir, with love
