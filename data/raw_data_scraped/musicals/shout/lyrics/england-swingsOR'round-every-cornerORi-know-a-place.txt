England Swings/'Round Every Corner/I Know A Place


Downtown!

Where all the lights are bright

Downtown!

Waiting for you tonight

Downtown

You?re gonna be alright now



England swings like a pendulum do,

Bobbies on bicycles, two by two,

Westminster Abbey the tower of Big Ben,

The rosy red cheeks of the little children



England swings like a pendulum do?



Round every corner, round every corner

Round every corner, round every corner

Round every corner, round every corner



Stop feeling sad now

Life ain't so bad now

Round every corner (round every corner)

While you're debating,

Something's a-waiting

Round every corner (round every corner)

When Columbus sailed away to other shores,

How could he imagine all that waited for him?

Round every corner (round every corner)

Round every corner (round every corner)



You've gotta stop a-sittin' there on the shelf

You've gotta start lookin' out for yourself



Every day when the work is behind you

And the shop and the store put the lock on the door

Just get away where your worries won't find you

If you like, well I'll tell you more



Don't let the day get the better of you

When the evening comes there's so much to do

You better put on your best and wear a smile

Just come along with me awhile



I know a place where the music is fine

And the lights are always low

I know a place where we can go



Ba ba ba ba da ba, smashing

Ba ba ba da ba ba, hip

Ba ba ba bad a ba?

Groovy, fab, cosmic, swingin?!



At the door there's a man who will greet you

Then you go downstairs to some tables and chairs

Soon I'm sure you'll be tappin' your feet

Because the beat is the greatest there



All around there are girls and boys

It's a swingin' place, a cellar full of noise

It's got an atmosphere of its own somehow

You gotta come along right now cuz I tell you



I know a place where the music is fine

And the lights are always low

I know a place where we can go



Oh? I know a place where the music is fine (I know a place)

And the lights are always low (I know a place)

I know a place where (I know a place)

England swings (yea, yea)

England swings (yea, yea)

England swings (yea, yea)

England swings (yea, yea, yea, yea!)

England swings!
