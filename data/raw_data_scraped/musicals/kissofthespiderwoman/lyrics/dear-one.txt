Dear One


Mother:

Dear one

No, I don't think about you

Dear one

I do nicely without you

Dear one

Say that over and over

Keep repeating it as the days go by



Marta: Mother:

Dear one

Nothing warm is denied Dear one

Dear one

I don't miss you inside me Dear one



Marta and Mother:

Dear one, say that over and over

Keep repeating it as the days go by

And someday you'll believe the lie



Valentin: Marta: Mother:

Dear one

I am through

With crusading Dear one

Dear one

All my anger is fading Dear one



Valentin and Marta:

Dear one, say that over and over

Keep repeating it as the hours fly



Molina: Mother:

Dear one No, I don't think about you

I don't see you crocheting I do nicely without you



Molina: Marta: Valentin:

Dear one Nothing warm is denied me

I can hear what I don't miss you Dear one

You're saying Inside me



Mother and Valentin:

Dear one



Molina and Mother: Valentin and Marta:

Say that over and over Dear one

Keep repeating it Say that over and over

Keep repeating it Keep repeating it

As the hours fly As the hours fly



All:

As the days go by



Valentin:

And someday



Mother:

Someday



Molina:

Maybe



Marta:

Maybe

You'll believe



Mother, Molina and Valentin:

You'll believe



All:

The lie...
