Gabriel's Letter/ My First Woman


Gabriel:

I'm sorry to hear they've taken you away

I'm sure you're innocent

You're such a good man

You must be innocent

And I'm sorry if I've never told you

How grateful i am

For the movies, the talks, and the books

The gifts to my wife and newborn child

I am truly sorry

And, finally, I'm sorry for any pain I may have caused you

I know what you wanted of me

But I'm just not that way

What a strange thing to be sorry for

But that's the way it is, isn't it?

I'm sorry, simply sorry!



Valentin:

My first woman, I remember my first woman

Back of a building

Me and my friends

A couple of pesos

There on the gravel

Down on her knees

What did she look like?

Probably plain

Who can remember?

But to me she was the keeper of all mystery

And, finally, I'm sorry

For any pain I may have caused you
