Kiss Of The Spider Woman


Spider Woman:

Sooner or later

You're certain to meet

In the bedroom, the parlor or even the street

There's no place on earth

You're likely to miss

Her kiss

Sooner or later

In sunlight or gloom

When the red candles flicker

She'll walk in the room

And the curtains will shake and the fire will hiss

Here comes her kiss

And the moon grows dimmer

At the tide's low ebb

And her black beads shimmer

And you're aching to move

But you're caught in the web

Of the Spider Woman

In her velvet cape

You can scream

But you cannot escape

Sooner or later your love will arrive

And she touches your heart

You're alert and alive

But there's only one pin

That can puncture such bliss

Her kiss

Sooner or later you bathe in success

And your minions salute

They say nothing but "YES"

But your power is empty

It fades like the mist

Once you've been kissed

And the moon grows dimmer

At the tide's low ebb

And your breath comes faster

And you're aching to move

But you're caught in the web

Of the Spider Woman

In her velvet cape

You can run

You can scream

You can hide

But you cannot escape!
