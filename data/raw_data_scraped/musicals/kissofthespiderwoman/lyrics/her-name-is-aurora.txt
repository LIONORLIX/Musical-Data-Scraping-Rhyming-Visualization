Her Name Is Aurora


Molina:

Aurora, help me...I need you...Come to me

like you always have...

Her name is Aurora and she is so beautiful

No man who has met her can even forget her

They're madly in love, forever in love

I see her so clearly, I know her so well...

She steps to her glass now

All almonds and roses

She's powered and pampered

The sight of her dark eyes

Igniting the screen...

Scorching the screen



Prisoners:

Look at her radiance

See how she glows

Look at her silken cheeks

Pink as rose

Tell us you secret madam

Tell us please do

What is this happiness shining from you?



Spider Woman:

So...you want to know...

Why I'm aglow...Oh!

Last night

I went too see the gypsy

And oh the things she had to say

She told me I would meet a stranger

A lean, handsome hero

Who'd sweep in and sweep me away

I sat there trembling at the table

And smelled the incense in the air

Someday you'll hear a cry, she told me

A sharp piercing sound and when you look around

The love of your life will be there!

I cannot tell you how you'll meet him

Or when you'll meet your love or where

But soon you'll hear that cry, she told me

And you'll look around...



Prisoners:

You'll look around!



Aurora:

At that sharp piercing



Company:

Sharp piercing

Sharp piercing

Sharp piercing

Sharp piercing...
