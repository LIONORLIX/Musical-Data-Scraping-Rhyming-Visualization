I Draw The Line


Valentin:

Will you please shut up

Will you ever shut up?

"Thank you very much!"

You're making me sick

With that prissy whine

Watch me now, I draw a line

So you stick to your side

And I'll stick to mine

Never, ever cross this line!



Molina:

Fine! But the pot,

How about the pot?



Valentin:

What about the pot?



Molina:

It's on your side



Valentin:

So what?



Molina:

So when I have to use the pot

I intend to use the pot



Valentin:

So what, that's an exception



Molina:

Oh, Gracious one, thanks a lot!



Valentin:

So don't ever try to be

Don't ever dream you'll be

Don't dare to think that you'll

Ever be some fairy friend of mine

Cause no, no, no, no, no!

That's where I draw the line



Molina:

Fine!



Valentin:

I draw the line



Molina:

Fine!



Valentin:

I draw the line



Molina:

Fine!
