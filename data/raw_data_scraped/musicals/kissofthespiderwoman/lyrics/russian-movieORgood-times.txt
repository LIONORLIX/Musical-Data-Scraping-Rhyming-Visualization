Russian Movie/Good Times


Molina:

Flame of St. Petersburg, the final reel, Tatyana Alexandrova,

vedette du cabaret, is singing her final number...



Aurora:

Aaah, aaah, aaah...



Molina:

All of St. Petersburg is there. The Tsar himself is in the audience.

It is a farewell performance, for tomorrow she will become the

Countess Ostrovsky.



Aurora:

There's going to be good times

Nothing but good times

They're going to be scattering today

And all of those bad times

Those terrible bad times

Are going to be packing up and leaving town today

So put on a smile

Start waving Your Hand

Whatever was grim is going to be grand .

And...

There's going to be good times

Nothing but good times

Good times are coming your way



Molina:

Cut to her dressing room and her faithful maid, Lisette

"Madame"



Aurora:

Yes, Lisette!



Molina:

"This note arrived for you"



Aurora:

"Count Ostrovsky has deceived you. Your lover, the student

revolutionary Bolshevik anarchist, Anatol, will be shot as he

waits for you in vain on the Pushkin bridge this evening at

the stroke of midnight. A friend."

I must save him, summon my troika.



Molina:

"But, Madame. the danger!"



Aurora:

Not a word, Lisette. Pas un mot!

To be in love is the sweetest thing.

But to risk everything for love is even sweeter!



Voice (Warden):

Tatyana, my love



Aurora:

C'est lui, Ostrovsky



Molina:

"How you hate him!"



Aurora:

Oh, God!



Voice:

My carriage is waiting, my love!



Aurora:

Quick. There's no time. I must slip out the back way.

Hold him at bay for as long as you can.



Voice:

Tatyana!



Aurora:

Adieu, Lisette. Courage.



Voice:

Tatyana!



Molina:

Cut to dark shadowy streets. Snow is falling.

The wind is whistling. A night of terror the clock

strikes midnight. Tatyana dismisses her trolka driver

and as she hurries down the empty, terrifying,

night-shadowed streets, her whole life swirls before her.

At last she sees the bridge over the canal and in the

light of a solitary streetlamp, her lover. She is in time.

She will save him. They will flee to Paris.

She begins to run but his figure seems to recede.

It's like a terrible dream.



Aurora:

Anatol!



Molina:

He turns. His eyes light up. He calls to her.



Valentin:

Tatyana!



Molina:

Bang. Close up.

Joy, not pain.

Illuminates her features

Courage, not fear is across her face.

This is not death. This is ecstasy



Aurora:

Anatol, my Anatol!

I wanted to warn you!



Molina:

"What have you done for me, my Tatyana?"



Aurora:

Nothing, nothing, my Anatol!



Molina:

Red blood stains the snowy street.

She is fading fast. But she is in her lover's arms again at last,

And somehow forever.

So put on a smile

Start waving your hand

Whatever was grim is going to be grand.

And...

There's going to be good times

Nothing but good times

Viva la guerra, viva la revolucion, viva-!



Valentin:

Good times are coming our way...



Molina:

Fade to black

The end.
