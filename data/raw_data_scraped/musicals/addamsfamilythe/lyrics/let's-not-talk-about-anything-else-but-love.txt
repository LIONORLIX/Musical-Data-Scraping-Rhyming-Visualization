Let's Not Talk About Anything Else But Love


(MAL)

Can we talk about anything else but love?



(GOMEZ)

Love that launchs a thousand ships



(MAL)

Please! let's talk about anything else but love



(GOMEZ)

Love that causes war and famine



(MAL)

Can't we speak about real state



(GOMEZ)

Love of wife



(MAL)

Watergate



(GOMEZ)

Love of children



(MAL)

Season of fluctuation in the prime interest rate



(GOMEZ)

Love of chocolate, you must love chocolate, everybody loves chocolate, say you do, say



(MAL)

Can't we talk about anything else but



(GOMEZ)

Love is elation, like an oration, love speaks to us in tongues, natural as teething, simple as breathing air in the.... ,

love looks at us and sighs



(MAL)

That's all a pack of lies, love is a fiction like an affliction, love is an ancient curse, tossing contentment, causing

resentment, fulfilment in reverse. Love is a dismal thing...



(GOMEZ)

Mal! Why should we fight, let's sing.

And you know the only thing better than singing?



(MAL)

What?



(GOMEZ)

Singing and dancing

Let's not talk about anything else but love, worth repeating, let's not talk about anything else but love



(MAL)

Why?



(GOMEZ)

Life is fleeting and pleasures come, pleasures go, love can come and go in one throw, let's not talk about anything else but

love, but love, but love



(FESTER)

Did I just hear the word love?



(GOMEZ)

Aha



(FESTER)

Let's not talk about anything else but love



(MAL)

Of all the scams I'd ever heard, love's the one that's most absurd



(FESTER)

Let's not talk about anything else but love



(MAL)

And look what good is done, not for me, not my son



(FESTER)

Be patient and soon the way will be clear



(GOMEZ)

Focus your fare



(FESTER)

And troubles all will disappear



(GOMEZ)

Let's not talk about anything else but love



(MAL)

It's hard for me to show you see, my mother didn't know you see



(GOMEZ/FESTER)

Let's not talk about anything else but love / Nothing better



(MAL)

Afraid of a touch, I don't like it so much



(GOMEZ/FESTER)

Hold on tight, say goodnight but don't dream of starting a fight, let's not talk about anything else but love.

Since the dawn of man began, everyone has had a plan, fron memphis to afghanistan, inmortalize by.... , just like an

orangutan, with a short attention span, so we'll do the best we canm by golly and by...

Let's not talk about anything old, please don't leave us out in the cold, let's not talk about anything else but love.



(GOMEZ/FESTER/MAL)

But love

But love
