The Moon And Me


Fester:

When the daylight ends and the moon ascends,

I would rather be just the moon and me.

When I feel her pull, then my heart is full.

And the night is softly, sweetly calling:

"Fester, look and see."



La la la la la la

La la la la la

La la la la la

It's a dream that's coming true

when the moon says "I love you".



Though I'm told it's wrong

when I sing my song

she accepts, she attends

she believes, she befriends.



Fester and Female Ancestors:

La la la la la la

(ohh la la la)

La la la la la

(ooh la la la)

La la la la la

(ooh la la la)

It's a dream that's coming true

when the moon says "I love you".



Fester:

How it can feel when love is real.



Fester and Female Ancestors:

La la la la la la

La la la la la

La la la la la

It's a dream that's coming true

when the moon says "I love you".



It's a dream that's coming true

when the moon says



Female Ancestors:

I love



Fester and Female Ancestors:

You.
