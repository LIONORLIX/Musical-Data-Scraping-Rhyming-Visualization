Waiting


Alice:

Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah



A woman waits for marriage

A woman waits for children

She waits for her big Mal to come back home

At five o'clock

Or six o'clock

'Til it's nine o'clock

And there's no o'clock to ease the pain

Pain she can't explain



As the woman waits in the dark

For a spark that once was there

That isn't there, not ever there!

Alone and

Waiting and wailing

Whining and waning

Wanting and wasting and woe



Waiting, fixating

Debating, lose weighting

Ice skating, lacating- and so



We wait to laugh

We wait to cry

We wait for every hopeful breath

Waiting for a lousy, rotting,

Vicious, rancid, fetid,

Frenzied, fatal death
