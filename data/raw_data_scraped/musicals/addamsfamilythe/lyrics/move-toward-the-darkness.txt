Lost your inhibitions

Love what once was vile

Move toward the darkness and smile

Conquering your pain

Move toward the darkness

Move toward the darkness



Gomez and Morticia:

Lurch and Company:

Love (love, love, love, love)



Gomez:

(Are you unhappy, my darling?)

Morticia:

(Oh, yes - yes, completely.)
