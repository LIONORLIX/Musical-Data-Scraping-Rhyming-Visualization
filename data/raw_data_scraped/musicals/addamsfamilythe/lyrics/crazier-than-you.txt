Crazier Than You


once, I was hopeful

thought we were one.

Life, less than perfect

finally begun.

But, now i wonder

are we undone?

i wanna treasure you in death as well as life

I wanna cut you with my love and with my knife

but can i live as your tormentor and your wife

when i am crazier than you

i'm crazier than you

and nothing up til now has proved me wrong

i'm crazier than you

that's just the overview

so get on board or simply move along



I'm not impulsive

(and yet i truly love you)

I'm not deranged

(i'd never ask that of you)

but in this moment

I feel I've changed.

I wanna climb Mt. Everest go to Mozambique

i wanna be impulsive want to be unique

can you believe i mean it when you hear me shriek

I'm crazier than you

I'm crazier than you

and now i'll prove to you exactly how

i'm crazier than you

I'll do what you can do

from here on in i give my solemn vow



pluck the arrow from its quiver,

hold it in your hand be brave.

Pierce the apple not the liver

or we're dancing on my grave.

Place it in the bow and steady,

Can't you shoot that thing already!

I wanna demonstrate that fear is my ideal

(girl believe me fear is your ideal)

Cause in the moment that you're frightened life is real

(then my life must be real real!)

and in a flash when i release and seal the deal



I'm crazier than you

I'm crazier than you

and nothing hurts me when i hear you say

I'm crazier than you

psychotically into

and that is all i need to face the day

i'm crazier than you

i'm crazier than you

and live or die i'll let you have control

I'm crazier than you

so say you love me too

from here on in you're singing to my soul

my soul!
