Live Before We Die


Gomez (sung):

Let's live before die...

lets laugh before we cry

Let's hold each other tight and die

Let's try before we fail

Let's fly before we bail

Let's keep things black and white and dance!



The World, We See. Can only be our friend

If You. And Me, keep dancing till the end

Cant' we see eye to eye, and over simplify.

Lets live before we die and dance!



Morticia: (spoken)

You think your pretty charming, don't you...



Gomez: (spoken)

You used to...



Morticia: (spoken)

That was yesterday...what about tomorrow!



Gomez: (spoken)

Oh my darling, don't ask for the stars, when we have this big love-struck moon!



Morticia:

I've never been inclined, to leave the past behind



Gomez:

Lets stay right where we are, and dance!



Moritcia:

Its like a castanet..we'll click with no regret!



Gomez:

Let's find the evening star and dance



Both:

The place were in, can never be what was

Till we begin what dancing does



Gomez:

Don't leave me high and dry

But can't you see that I say live before we die..and..



Morticia: (spoken)

Has anyone ever told you? You move like a corpse!



Gomez:  (spoken)

Thank You! I studied with Lurch!



If time keeps ticking by...

Then maybe we should try

to face it as a pair and dance!



Both:

Although we're lost! Where drifting out to sea

But side by side, where gloomy as can be..



Gomez:

As gloomy as can be...If you can take my hand..

Then surely, we could stand and live before we die...and...



Moricia:

Dance



(Tango begins)
