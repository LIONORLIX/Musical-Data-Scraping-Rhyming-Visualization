Where Did We Go Wrong


Morticia (Spoken):

She's perky



Gomez (Spoken):

She's bubbly



Morticia (Spoken):

She's optimistic



Gomez(Spoken):

Where did we go wrong?



Morticia:

We taught her to hunt



Gomez:

We taught her to aim



Morticia:

We gave her a bow



Gomez:

We gave her no shame



Morticia:

We gave what we had



Gomez:

Made sure she was bad



Both:

Did all that we could to keep her sad



Gomez:

We told her to stay away from modern jazz



Morticia:

We gaver her that week long trip to Alcatraz



Gomez:

We promised she'd be equipped



Both:

And filled her crypt with woe

What'd we know?



Gomez:

We took her to funerals in the morning mist



Morticia:

We took her to slaughter houses



Gomez:

Schindler's list



Morticia:

We taught her to scowl and sneer and domineer



Gomez:

On cue



Both:

What did we do?

Where did we go wrong?



Gomez (Spoken):

Are we good parents?



Both:

Where did we go wrong?



Morticia (Spoken):

Are we cliche?



Both:

Somewhere in between

Guilt and guillotine

We forgot to notice that our daughter lost her way

Where did we go wrong?



Morticia:

And can we fix this?



Gomez:

Maybe  it's a passing phase



Both:

But if she's going wrong

Then what will change her ways?



Gomez (Spoken):

That's it!  We'll cancel this dinner



Morticia (Spoken):

We'll circle the wagon



Gomez (Spoken):

And give these "goody-licious" Beinekes the boot!



Morticia:

We must intervene



Gomez:

We shouldn't delay



Morticia:

She's  barely eighteen



Gomez:

So what do we say?



Morticia:

We know the occult



Gomez:

That's certainly true



Morticia:

We're to consult



Gomez:

Morticia, with you



Morticia:

So why all the fuss?



Gomez:

My darling, discuss



Morticia:

She needs only us



Gomez:

It's us, only us



Morticia:

We've always been there for her

To swear for her







Gomez:

Discourage dental care for her



Both:

Do well  for her

Excel for her

Make home a living hell for her

So where did we go wrong

Is not the question

Resolute and strong

Is our next move



Gomez:

We'll tell her today



Morticia:

Do what we say



Both:

Send all the Beinekes back to the fray

Turn them  away at first sight

And that's where we'll go right?



Both(Spoken):

No dinner tonight!
