ALL

Questions, questions

Things we gotta know-

Everything from



BRETT

Are you real?



IRIS

To how you make it snow...



ALL

Answers, answers

Never seem to come!



JOANNA

Why do people have to die?



THEO

And who invented gum?



JOANNA/IRIS

Maybe you are hard of hearing



KICKER/THEO

Maybe you don't really care



JOANNA

Maybe you are on vacation



BRETT

Maybe you're not really there



ALL

Maybe we're talking to the air!



Letters, letters...

Maybe if we write,

Then we'll get an answer

If your schedule's not too tight.



Lot's of letters

That's the way to start.

Letters from what's on our mind

And letters from the heart...



BRETT

Things we'd never ask our parents...



KICKER

Like what about the birds and bees?



THEO

And why is Sunday School on Sunday?



ALL

So God,

How about it?

Tell us, please...



IRIS/JOANNA/KICKER

How do you make the water freeze?



THEO/BRETT

Why do the Swiss make better cheese?



ALL

Who says "God bless you!"

When you sneeze?



Questions, questions

Running through my brain



KICKER/IRIS

Do you look like Hercules...?



JOANNA/THEO/BRETT

Or more like cellophane?



ALL

And after you answer these

We're not through...

God, you have a lot of explaining

To do!
