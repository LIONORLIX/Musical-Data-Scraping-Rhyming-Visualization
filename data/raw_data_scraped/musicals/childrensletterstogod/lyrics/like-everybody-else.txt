Like Everybody Else


Joanna (Spoken):

Go ahead, Theo, make a wish and blow out the candles.



Theo (Spoken):

I wish...that I didn't drop a fly ball every single time...

or go on my rollerblades without falling over...and not have

this stupid baby face so I look about 5 years old...

I wish I could be like everybody else.



Joanna (Spoken):

Theo, why would you want to waste a perfectly good wish on that?

(Sung) If everyone you knew was just like everybody else...



Kicker:

They probably would never have Olympics.

Cause if a hundred people ran the hundred meter race,

we'd need hundred medals for they'd all come in first place.



Joanna:

If everyone you knew was just like everybody else,

you couldn't tell my brother from a turtle.



Iris:

Except one likes the water



Joanna:

And the other hates a bath.



Brett:

One gives off a funny smell,



Joanna:

The other stinks at math.



Kicker (Spoken):

Hey!



Joanna:

Both could use a harder shell.



Iris:

Time will tell, it's just as well.



All (except Theo):

That everyone you know is not like everybody else...



Brett:

We probably would never go to movies...

You wouldn't want to spend your money just to sit and see



All (except Theo):

People who all look and act the same as you and me!



Iris:

Life would be an awful bore.



Joanna:

What is more



Brett:

Be thankful you're



All (except Theo):

Theo!

And you're someone unlike everybody else!



Theo:

But if I only had a body that nobody would tease...



Iris:

Well, I wish I didn't have big ears, but so what?



Kicker:

Oh, give me longer legs.



Joanna:

Without knobby legs.



Brett:

I have a giant birthmark right on my butt.



Iris/Kicker:

So Theo stop your crying and trying to please...



Joanna:

Be pleased with who you are.



All (except Theo):

A one-of-a-kind!



All:

Oh, if everyone you knew was just like everybody else...



Theo:

I guess there'd be a million, trillion Theo's.



Joanna:

And unlike every snowflake everyone would be the same,



Brett:

And when I'd call, "Hey, Theo!"

They'd all answer to your name.



Iris:

You couldn't tell who's real or fake,



Kicker:

I could take your piece of cake!



All (except Theo):

No mistake about it, can't you see...



Brett:

A snake's not meant to fly.

A bird's not meant to swim.



Kicker:

I'm glad that I'm not her...



Joanna:

I'm thrilled that I'm not him.



Iris:

Be happy you are you



Iris/Brett:

Cause two of you won't do.



All (except Theo):

And that goes double if there were a few!

For if everyone you knew was just like everyone you knew then it would be our birthday too!

"Happy birthday to us..."



Theo:

No!

Me!



All (except Theo):

Happy birthday to you!
