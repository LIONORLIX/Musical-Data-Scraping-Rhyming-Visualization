Questions for the Rain


KICKER (spoken)

Dear God...Last week it rained so much it was almost like Noah's Ark.

But I'm glad it wasn't 'cause you could only take two of things, remember?

And we have three cats!



IRIS

What did people do before umbrellas?



THEO

Do fish have a clue that it's raining?



BRETT

Why's it always fall on

Some important baseball game?



JOANNA

How come flowers grow...



KICKER

But I just stay the same?



THEO

Can't you make it so it skips the weekends?



IRIS

Does rain mean

That you might be crying?



JOANNA

Is it like the snow:

Are no two raindrops alike?



THEO

Why does it turn grass green...



BRETT

But it just rusts my bike?



ALL

Questions for the rain

While thunderclaps are ringing



THEO

Why does Daddy curse it...



JOANNA

But in movies they start singing?



ALL

Why's it always clear?

Is it tears disguised?



KICKER

Is it safe to drink?



BRETT

Should we wait till it's pasteurized?



ALL

Quesetions for the rain...

Some things I sometimes wonder...

Which is it more fond of:

The lightning or the thunder?



IRIS

Does the sun get wet,

Or does the rain pass right through it?



THEO

When you make it rain

How do you know how long to do it?



ALL

Questions for the rain...



(Iris screams)



JOANNA (spoken)

What's the matter?



IRIS (spoken)

Arnold's not moving! I think he's...dead!



KICKER (spoken)

Really? Dead? Wow! How can you tell?



BRETT (spoken)

Turtles look dead even when they're alive!



JOANNA (spoken)

Oh, Brett!



BRETT (spoken)

Let me take his pulse.



KICKER (spoken)

I never saw anything dead before...except an ant.



BRETT (spoken)

Yep. He's dead all right.



(Iris sobs)



JOANNA (spoken)

Some people think we live after we die.



BRETT (spoken)

Forget it.



IRIS (spoken)

If we live after we die, why do we have to die then?



THEO (spoken)

Maybe it was his time.



IRIS (spoken)

It's not fair! If I was God I would let everybody's turtle live forever!



BRETT (spoken)

Nobody lives forever.



KICKER (spoken)

Dear God...What is it like when you die? I just want to know, I don't want to do it.



JOANNA (spoken)

It's sad, but you were lucky you had such a great turtle.



IRIS (spoken)

Dear God...Instead of letting people die and having to make new ones,

why don't you just keep the ones you've got now?



ALL (except Iris)

God, we give you thanks

Just like on Thanksgiving...



IRIS

But I'd be more thankful

If my friend was living.



THEO

Was he in much pain?

He looks awful green!



BRETT

Arnold was a turtle

They are always green!



IRIS

Oh, why did you take him in his prime?!



THEO

Was he really that young?



IRIS

I'd say he was maybe three or so...

With turtles it's kind of hard to know.



JOANNA (spoken)

And so we lay to rest Iris Chang's eloved turtle,

Arnold Chang.



KICKER

Is there such a thing as turtle heaven?



THEO

Will Arnold come back as a rabbit?



IRIS

Will I ever see my littel friend again?

P.S. There's no rushs...

Remember, I'm just ten.



KICKER

If he's wet, will he get

Pneumonia?



THEO

Why am I hungry for French fries?



JOANNA

Even though he's gone,

Is it still helpful to pray?



BRETT

If the rain won't stop

Will Arnold float away...?



ALL

Questions for the rain...

I'm happy to have known him.



IRIS

Don't mean to complain, but

Is it too late to clone him?



ALL

He will always be

Turtle number one,

The very best of friends...

We sure had lots of fun.



IRIS

Thank you for my Arnold...



ALL

And thank you for the sun.
