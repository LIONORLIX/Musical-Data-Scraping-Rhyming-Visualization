Thirteen


Brett:



(Spoken)

Dear God...How do you feel about people who don't believe in you?

Somebody else wants to know.



Cake and ice cream and party favors.

Playing games with friends - Big wow.

Why is it things I loved last year seem so stupid now?



Dad moves out on November Seventh;

I grew an inch-and-a-half last spring.

So many changes in one year.

Wonder what next year will bring?



Turn thirteen and things go crazy..

Felling like a total freak!

Voice is getting lower, school year's getting slower,

and I'm shaving every other week!



Dad moved out on November seventh;

Mom threw out her wedding ring.

So man changes in one year...

Wonder what next year will bring?
