How Come?


Joanna

Dear God,

You better make all the bad things go away

Or you won?t get elected next time.



Kicker

Dear God,

How come, if you really are God,

You know everything bad before it happens,

Why do you let it happen?



Iris

What kind of a world is it,

Where so many terrible things happen?

Maybe you better start it all over again.



Theo

How come my friend is moving away?



Kicker

How come my sister?s bossy all day?



Joanna

How come sometimes I just wanna cry?



Brett

How come it?s rotten saying goodbye?



All

What?s the gain in feeling pain,

When feeling good is great?

How come?



Kicker

I?ll soon have to date?



Joanna

How come you bless us after we sneeze,

But you don?t put an end to disease?



Kicker

How come I?ve trouble tying my shoes?



Brett

How come it?s never easy to choose?



Joanna

Bombs explode?



Theo

And rocky road, I?m not supposed to eat



All

How come?



Iris

I?ve got smelly feet?



Theo

How come every cat has nine lives but mine?



Brett

How come you invented divorce?



Joanna

Brett?s never sent me a Valentine.



Kicker

And I still do not own a horse.



Iris

How come, in school, I gotta to learn French?



Theo

How come, in sports, I just warm the bench?



Joanna

How come some countries suffer from drought?



Kicker

How come my tonsils have to come out?



Brett

People swear?



Joanna

And where?s clean air?



Kicker

And where?s some dinosaurs?



All

How come, there?ll always be wars?



Iris

How come all my teeth are loaded with plaque?



Theo

How come I don?t have perfect sight?



All

How come you make colors in every shade,

But some only see black and white?



Iris, Theo, Brett

How come some never learn right from wrong?



Joanna, Kicker

How come some countries can?t get along?



All

How come some people get really sick?

We need some answers, double quick!

Do you care that life?s unfair?

It means a lot to some.



We need to know right now,

Why all this you allow?



Brett

How?



Iris

How?



Theo

How?



Kicker

How?



Joanna

How?



All

How come?
