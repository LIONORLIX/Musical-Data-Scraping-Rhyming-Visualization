Arnold


Iris (Spoken):

Theo, I just came to tell you that I am not coming to your birthday party.



Theo (Spoken):

But you're already HERE!



Iris (Spoken):

I'm leaving because your dumb invitation says "No turtles allowed."



Theo (Spoken):

Birthdays are for people, not pets.



Iris (Spoken):

Which shows how little you know, since it is a fact of nature that Arnold is more than just a pet!

(Sung)It's not like he can fetch a stick or hop or purr or even lick.

But God had better things in mind, you see, the day he brought Arnold to me...



Theo (Spoken):

I said no turtles!



Iris:

Arnold knows its okay to take time.

It's okay to study a blade of grass.



Arnold knows when I've got show 'n tell I can always take him to class.



Arnold knows how to listen real hard if I share a secret, he?ll never talk.

And Arnold knows to retreat in his shell and do his cool impression of a rock.



Theo (Spoken):

Hey! Is this my birthday or what?!



All (except Theo):

He's slow so I know just where to find him.

And he moves like people do when they get old.

So who cares if he's not speedy as a rocket?

How many pets can fit inside your pocket?



Arnold knows.



Iris:

When I don't wear a smile...



Joanna:

It's because a smile doesn't fit your mood.



All (except Theo):

Arnold knows



Iris:

That I like what he likes.



Kicker:

But you'll never like turtle food.



Iris:

And Arnold knows how to bend right in:

He won't scream for attention to prove he's smart...

And if he moves at a slower pace,

Arnold knows



All (expect Theo):

Arnold knows



Iris:

My Arnold knows how to find a place in my heart.
