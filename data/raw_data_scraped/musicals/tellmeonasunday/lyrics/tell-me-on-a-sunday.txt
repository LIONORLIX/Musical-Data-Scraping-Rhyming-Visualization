Tell Me On A Sunday


Don't write a letter when you want to leave

Don't call me at 3 a.m. from a friend's appartment

I'd like to choose how I hear the news

Take me to a park that's covered with trees

Tell me on a Sunday please



Let me down easy, no big song and dance

No long faces, no long looks no deep conversation

I know how I want you to say goodbye

Take me to a zoo that's got chimpanzees

Tell me on a Sunday please



Don't want to know who's to blame

It won't help knowing

Don't want to fight day and night bad enough you're going

Don't leave in silence with no word at all

Don't get drunk and slam the door

That's no way to end this

I know how I want you to say goodbye

Find a circus ring with a flying trapeze

Tell me on a Sunday please



I don't want to fight day and night bad enough you're going

Don't leave in silence with no word at all

Don't get drunk and slam the door

That's no way to end this

I know how I want you to say goodbye

Find a circus ring with a flying trapeze

Tell me on a Sunday please
