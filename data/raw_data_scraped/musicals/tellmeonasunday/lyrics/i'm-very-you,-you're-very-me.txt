I'm Very You, You're Very Me


I'm very you, you're very me

We seem to go well together

You're very me, I'm very you

A perfect match I would say

We mean the world to each other

There are no lengths that we wouldn't go to

Goes to show you...

I'm very you, you're very me

We make a great combination

You're very me, I'm very you

No one could be

More in tune with me

Like sea and sand, like sun and sky

There'll always be you and I



I'm very you, you're very me

We are compatible people

You're very me, I'm very you

I guess we're two of a kind

I stay away when you're moody

If I don't want to talk you make no fuss

We both know us!

I'm very you, you're very me

We're 'bout as close as you can be

You're very me, I'm very you

Sometimes we get

Angry and upset

But each fight ends the way it should

We both make up very good



I'm very you, you're very me

If I was Jane, you'd be Tarzan

You're very me, I'm very you

If I am Bonnie, you're Clyde

If you're New York, then I'm Broadway

If I'm a violin, you're Yehudi

Punch and Judy!

I'm very you, you're very me

We just can't be separated

You're very me, I'm very you

No one has got

What we two have got

Like P and Q, like two and three

You'll always be next to me
