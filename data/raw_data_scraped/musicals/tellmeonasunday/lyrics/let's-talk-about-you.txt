Let's Talk About You


Funny... always thought of you as my girlfriend

I just can't believe you could come in here and say all those things

Let me finish... you must let me finish

Thank you... thanks for bringing me up to date, dear

Didn't know you knew all the ins and outs of my private life

Let me finish... you must let me finish



Let's talk about you

A minute or two

What tart is your husband keeping?

Where's he sleeping?

Can't you say?



Let's talk about men

You're at it again!

I've heard that you need a bedful

For those dreadful

Games you play



How dare you come in here

Wagging your wicked tongue?

Your cheeks are red, my dear

You look like you've been stung

I know my life's a mess... but I think you're the worst thing in it

Wait a minute...



Let's talk about you

Because you never do

You just couldn't wait to blurt out

All that dirt out in my face



Let's talk about pills

And illegal thrills

I hear that the habit's gripped you

And you've tripped to every place



Does it make you feel good

Knowing that I feel bad?

Yes, knowing you it would

You must be very sad

You can't know how I feel

But my friend you're about to learn how

It's my turn now...



Let's talk about booze

And how much you use

What time do your kids start drinking?

Am I sinking low as you?



Yes, he knows lots of girls... he likes his fun

I am glad he's got lots and not just one

How's that fat little man... was it one more affair?



Where are you going... why are you running away from me?

Are you absolutely sure you don't want to stay for tea?
