You Made Me Think You Were In Love


You made me think you were in love

You made me think that I was all you'd need

You made me think you were in love

I could've sworn you'd give the world to be mine

Looked that way

Till you called today



You made me think you were in love

You could've used your charm on someone else

You made me think you were the one

You know I built a lot of dreams on your smile

How can you do the things you do?



Last thing at night you used to call me

Soon as you woke up you called me

I made you laugh and we both liked the same things

You always looked happy... very happy

Whatever you wanted I thought I could give you

I ought to hate you but I want you even more

What did you do it for?



You made me think you were in love

We're both too old to play these kind of games

I should be sorry that I met you

You made me mad but I'm not over you yet

And I don't know

If I can let go.
