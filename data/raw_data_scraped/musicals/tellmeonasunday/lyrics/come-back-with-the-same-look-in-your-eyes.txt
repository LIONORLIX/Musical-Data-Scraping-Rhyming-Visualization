Come Back With The Same Look In Your Eyes


I will see you in a week or two

It's late

You better get going

Take care of yourself and call anytime you feel that you're missing me

I can only say what I always say at these goodbyes

Come back with the same look in your eyes



I know you have your work to do

And I know how much you love me

But sometimes a friendly face can look good to you on a lonely night

If there comes a time just remember I'm the kind that cries

Come back with the same look in your eyes



Everything we want we find in each other

We would be fools to let love slip away

Everything's so right I'm scared that we might lose it one day

We could never keep things from one another

You know all the feelings that are in my heart

It's not easy... it's not easy

When you have to be apart



So I'll see you in a week or two

It's late

You better get going

You'd think that by now we'd know how to handle this but we never will

When you are away every day I pray that nothing dies... and you'll

Come back with the same look in your eyes
