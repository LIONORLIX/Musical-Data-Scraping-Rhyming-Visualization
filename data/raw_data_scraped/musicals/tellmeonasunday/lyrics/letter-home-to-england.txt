Letter Home To England


Mum I've got a lot to tell you

Me and Joe have had a bust up

This will be the last letter with the post mark stamped N.Y.

I've met a film producer

Please don't laugh

His name is Sheldon

He's what the people here all call a real together guy



He is off to California

And he wants me to go with him

Oh thanks for your last letter

I was thrilled to hear from you

The pictures of the garden are all absolutely lovely

And incidentally Sheldon's mum loves Mantovani too



Mum I'm not at all unhappy

One day soon when I am settled

I want you both to come out

You will love it in L.A.

I've got to buy some swimsuits

So I must rush down to Macy's

I will write to you again

When I have found a place to stay
