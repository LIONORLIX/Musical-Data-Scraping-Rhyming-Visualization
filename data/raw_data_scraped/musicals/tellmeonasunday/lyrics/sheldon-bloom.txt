Sheldon Bloom


I'll walk your dog

You can be the first one in the shower

We'll make love every hour

Beneath your Van Gogh



I'll park the car

I'll whistle while the eggs are fryin'

Dance while your shirts are dryin'

Waltz or tango?



Let me move in and let's get this show rolling

I'll talk to your plants

I'll even go bowling

There is nothing I wouldn't do

I'll be the perfect little lady for you

Sheldon Bloom

Make some room



Won't say a word

When you're watching Spencer Tracey

I'll learn to dig Count Basie

Nothing to it

I'll start to jog

If that's what you want to take up

I'll stop wearing make up

I can do it!



When you meditate I promise you I'll be quiet

I won't eat eclairs

I'll share your sugar free diet

There is nothing I wouldn't do

I'll be the perfect little lady for you

Pass the key

Sheldon B



No horoscopes

You won't ever hear me mention Pisces

There won't be any crises

You can bet that

I'll give up pork

And I will tune that old viola

Quote things from Emile Zola

I must get that



I will make you feel well when you feel fluey

Be your analyst when your head's real screwy

There is nothing I wouldn't do

I'll be the perfect little lady for you

Sheldon dear

I like it here.
