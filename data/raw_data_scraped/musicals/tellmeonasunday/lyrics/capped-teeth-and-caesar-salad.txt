Capped Teeth And Caesar Salad


Capped teeth and Caesar Salad

Good old Beverly Hills

With every deal that's done

An award is won

You can rent a car

Or rent a star

Suntans and Sunday brunches

Sprinklers sprinkle away

Careers are being hyped

Before the scripts are typed

I'll call you back and have a nice day



Capped teeth and Caesar Salad

Spotless Beverly Hills

If someone takes a walk

All the neighbours talk

Every man and beast

Came from out East

Egos and valet parking

Newsmen gossip away

If you don't mean a thing

You'll find your phone won't ring

I'll call you back and have a nice day



("Hello... Mr. Stigwood's Office - No, I'm afraid he's at a screening. If you would like to leave word we'll get right back to you. Thank you for calling - Have a nice day.")



Capped teeth and Caesar Salad

Prime time Beverly Hills

The cost of land's so high

You can't afford to die

When you feel bad there

You dial-a-prayer

Earthquakes and English muffins

Ulcers popping away

It's like a fairy tale

Long as you don't inhale

I'll call you back and have a nice day.
