Who is the man who will spend

Or will even lend?

Harrigan, that's me!

Who is your friend

When you find that you need a friend?

Harrigan, that's me!



For i'm just as proud of my name, you see,

As an emperor, czar or a king, could be

Who is the man helps a man ev'ry time he can?

Harrigan, that's me!



"h", "a", double "r", "i",

"g-a-n" spells harrigan.

Proud of all the irish blood that's in me,

Divil a man can say a word agin me.



"h" "a" double "r" "i",

"g-a-n", you see!

Is a name that a shame

Never has been connected with

Harrigan, that's me!



Who is the man never stood for a gad-about?

Harrigan, that's me!

Who is the man that the town's simply mad about?

Harrigan, that's me!



The ladies and babies are fond of me,

I'm fond of them, too, in return, you see,

Who is the gent that's deserving a monument?

Harrigan, that's me!
