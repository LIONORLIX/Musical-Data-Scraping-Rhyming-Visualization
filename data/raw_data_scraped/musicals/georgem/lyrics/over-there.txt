Over There


Johnnie, get your gun, get your gun, get your gun,

Take it on the run, on the run, on the run,

Hear them calling you and me, ev'ry son of liberty

Hurry right away, no delay, go today

Make your Daddy glad to have had such a lad,

Tell your sweetheart not to pine, to be proud her boy's in line



Over there, over there!

Send the word, send the word, over there!

That the Yanks are coming, the Yanks are coming,

The drums rum-tumming ev'rywhere!

So prepare, say a prayer, send the word, send the word to beware!

We'll be over, we're coming over,

And we won't come back 'til it's over

Over There!



Johnnie, get your gun, get your gun, get your gun,

Johnnie show the Hun you're a son of a gun!

Hoist the flag and let her fly,

Yankee Doodle do or die

Pack your little kit, show your grit, do your bit



Yankees to the ranks from the towns and the tanks

Make your mother proud of you and the old Red White and Blue



Over there, over there,

Send the word, send the word, over there!

That the Yanks are coming, the Yanks are coming,

The drums rum-tumming ev'ry where

So prepare, say a prayer, send the word, send the word to beware

We'll be over, we're coming over,

And we won't come back 'til it's over

Over There!
