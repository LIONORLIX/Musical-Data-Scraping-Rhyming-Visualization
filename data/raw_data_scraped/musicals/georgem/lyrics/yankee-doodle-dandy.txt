Yankee Doodle Dandy


I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy,

A Yankee Doodle do or die;

A real live nephew of my Uncle Sam's.

Born on the Fourth of July.

I've got a Yankee Doodle sweetheart,

She's my Yankee Doodle joy.

Yankee Doodle came to London,

Just to ride the ponies,

I'm a Yankee Doodle boy.



I'm the kid that's all the candy,

I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy

I'm glad I am!

So's Uncle Sam!



I'm a real live Yankee Doodle,

Made my name and fame and boodle,

Just like Mister Doodle did by riding on a pony



I love to listen to the Dixie Strain,

I long to see the girl I left behind me;

And that ain't a josh, she's a Yankee, by gosh!



Oh, say can you see...

Anything about a Yankee that's a phoney?



I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy!

A Yankee Doodle Do or Die!

A real live nephew of my Uncle Sam's

Born on the Fourth of July!



I've got a Yankee Doodle Sweetheart

She's my Yankee Doodle Joy



Yankee Doodle came to London

Just to ride the ponies,

I am a Yankee Doodle Boy!



I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy!

A Yankee Doodle Do or Die!



A real live nephew of my Uncle Sam's

Born on the Fourth of July!



I've got a Yankee Doodle Sweetheart

She's my Yankee Doodle Joy



Yankee Doodle came to London

Just to ride the ponies,

I am that Yankee Doodle Boy!
