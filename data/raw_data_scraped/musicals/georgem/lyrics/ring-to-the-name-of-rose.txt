Ring To The Name Of Rose


There's a ring to the name of Rosie,

A ring-tingaling to the name of Rosie.

Other names you may say ring true,

So they do, but they ring for you.

I still cling to the name of Rosie

For there's something to the name of    Rosie

That gives my heart

That ring-a-Rosie ring-

a-ling-tingaling

There's a ring to the name of Rose.
