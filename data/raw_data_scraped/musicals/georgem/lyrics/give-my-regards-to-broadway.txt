Give My Regards To Broadway


Give my regards to Broadway,

Remember me to Herald Square;

Tell all the gang at 42nd Street,

That I will soon be there.

Whisper of how I'm yearning

To mingle with the old time throng;

Give my regards to old Broadway,

And say that I'll be there e'er long.



Give my regards to Broadway,

Remember me to Herald Square;

Tell all the gang at 42nd Street,

That I will soon be there.

Whisper of how I'm yearning

To mingle with the old time throng;

Give my regards to old Broadway,

And say that I'll be there e'er long.

Did you ever see two Yankees part upon a foreign shore?

When the good ship's just about to start for Old New York once more?

With tear dimmed eye, they say goodbye

They're friends, without a doubt;

When the man on the pier shouts, "Let them clear!"

As the ship strikes out.



Give my regards to Broadway!

Remember me to Herald Square!

Tell all the gang at Forty Second Street

That I will soon be there!

Whisper of how I'm yearning

To mingle with the old time throng!

Give my regards to Old Broadway

And say that I'll be there, 'ere long!



Give my regards to Broadway!

Tell all the gang at Forty Second Street

That I will soon be there!

Whisper of how I'm yearning

To mingle with the old time throng!

Give my regards to Old Broadway

And say that I'll be there, 'ere long!
