Man Behind The Mask


Luisa:

There's nothing left

No second chance

For passion has it's price.

So much to give, so much to loose

a lover's sacrfice.



There is so much I need to know.

But am I too afraid to ask.

Who is the man, the man I love

Behind the mask?



How can I trust? How can I live?

In this world of civil rights

For nothing's changed I'll always live

Filled with questions and regrets



There is so much I need to know.

But am I too afraid to ask.

Who is the man, the man I love

Behind the mask?



All I know

Is how you make me feel

All I know,

That's real, is your embrace

Always dreaming

How can I show you? I know you

When will I see your face?



I can't go back, I can't forget

Yet we never found a way

You brought me light, you gave me hope

Although I never heard you say



There is so much I need to know.

And yet I'm too afraid to ask.

Who is the man, the man I love

Behind the mask?



All I know

Is how you make me feel

All I know,

That's real, is your embrace

Always dreaming

How can I show you? I know you

When will I see your face?



Trust me, you couldn't trust me

I was a fool, to ever feel like this

A little girl, dreaming of a kiss



I can't go back, I can't forget

Yet we never found a way

You brought me light, you gave me hope

And though I'll never hear you say



There is so much I need to know.

And still I'm too afraid to ask.

Who is the man, the man I love

Behind the mask?



All I know

All I know

That's real, is your embrace

Always dreaming

How can I show you? I know you

When will I see your face?



Who is the man, the man I love

The man behind the mask?
