A Love We'll Never Live


Diego: I'm a fool, nothing more

Who's just living a lie



Luisa: Just a man, who's afraid

Will I ever know why?



Diego: She gave me her trust

And I betrayed her



Both: There a questions that fear cannot deny.



Both: How can (s)he love me?

How can (s)he ever feel

That (s)he can  trust me?

That my love is my real

Is this a gift that we can never give

Is this a love we'll never live?



Luisa: If we live with regrets

We're not living at all.

Will the fear of betrayl ever fade?



Diego: A chance that is lost

For a liftime

Just a moment



Luisa: A choice we never made

Yet will I ever know the heat at night?



Diego: How can we live alone at night?



Luisa: And will I ever share the morning light?



Diego: Or ever share the morning night?



Luisa: Is this a gift that I can never give?



Diego: Is this a gift we will never give?



Both: Is this a love we'll never live



Diego: I could try to be there when she needs me



Luisa: When will he see?

All I need is a sign



Diego: I could be all she dreams

Play the part



Luisa: Right from the start

Tell me how did he know



Diego: But I know in the end



Luisa: Why did he leave?



Diego: Would she believe me?



Luisa: Don't ever leave me



Diego: Am I right? Too late to reach her heart



Luisa: Never too late



Both: Don't keep us apart!



This is a promise we can never make

This is a silence we can never break

A twist of fate

How can our hearts forgive

This is a love we'll never live



For the dream in my heart

I could never forgive

Is a love that we will never live
