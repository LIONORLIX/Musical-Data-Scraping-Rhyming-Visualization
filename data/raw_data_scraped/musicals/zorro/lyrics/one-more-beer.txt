One More Beer


Inez:[spoken] You are a great, great man



Garcia:[spoken] Then listen to me. For soon he will see I'm a man with the courage of Zorro!



Garica: Then he'll be wishing

He had shown more respect, my dear

I'll make him regret,

The day that we met

He'll come back, say sorry, tomorrow

I'll be the hero

I'm a soldier who knows no feer

One more beer!



Inez: Where would be without Garcia?

The man who stands up for our rights?

Who shows us the way with his courage

Thanks to him we can sleep safe at nights



Imagine a life without Garica

The one that a woman can trust



Inez and Women of the Pueblo:

So let's thank the Lord

For his skill with the sword

For we all need a man who can thrust!



Garcia: One more beer!



Garica: She doesn't know yet

But I'll tell you I've met

A lovely senorita to marry

She will love her hero

She's the luckiest girl, my dear



Inez: Here's to the bride!



Women of the Pueblo: A knot to be tied

They live in a small hacenda

He'll fetch the babies

I wonder just who she could be?



Garcia: One more beer!



Garcia: In return for her kisses and cuddles

She won't believe her luck



Inez and Women of the Pueblo:

So let's thank the Lord

For his skill with the sword

For we all need a man who can f-



Garcia: Full of love for Garcia

Allies the darkest night



Inez and Women of the Pueblo:

Her hair as red as rubies

A smile of pure delight



Garcia: Each night in my dreams she is dancing

I pray that she's dancing for me



Inez and Women of the Pueblo:

So let's thank the Lord

For his skill with the sword



Garcia: I'm glad that you ladies agree



Inez and Women of the Pueblo:

Savour my soul with Garcia

We know what he's thinking



Inez: [spoken] He's thinking?



Inez and Women of the Pueblo:

As long as we beat him

He's there when we need him

He's brave and enlightened

And when we are frightened

We'll cower behind

And we know we will find him

Drinking just one more beer!



Garcia: [spoken] Let's dance!



Garcia: Mi amor, will you marry me?



Inez: One more beer!



Garcia, Inez and Women of the Pueblo: One more beer!
