In One Day


[Luisa]

In one day

When the winter storms are fading

You can see the flower grow

In one day

You can see the river falling

From the mountain blessed with snow

In one day

You can hear the people praying

For our homeland

For the land we used to know

[Woman 1]

In one day

Every man will fight for justice

But his fear will never show

[Woman 2]

In one day

Every mother guides her children

Though the journey may be slow

[Woman 3]

In one day

You can hear the people praying

For our homeland

[All]

For the land we used to know

And one day

We will sing our songs of freedom

Now the battle lines are drawn

For one day

We will break the chains around us

On our brothers blood we swore

[Luisa}

That one day

[All]

That one day

That one day

We will see our friends returning

To our homeland

To the land where we were born
