Bamboleo


Inez:

When times are hard

You're in disgrace

You're stressed

When days are long

You need a place to rest

When night's are cold

You need your face caressed

What you need,

Is a place to drink!



Garcia: [spoken]

I can't drink while I'm in my uniform!



Inez:[spoken]

Well, I'm sure we can do something about that!



A place where men can dance the night away!

A home from home where men will fight to stay.

A bar, where girls will lead you quite astray!

All you need

Is a drink!



Inez: [spoken]

Well, look if the seargent is drinking the cantina must be officailly open!



There's a tale

Rarely told, about a gypsy

Out the city past midnight

Her smiles are full of secrets

Her lips so full of promise

And she calls

You hear her calling your name



If you look

She is there, while you are dreaming

Dancing in the firelight

The light that catch your shadow

Her beauty's any sunset



And she calls, and she calls, and she calls

STOP

When she calls, when she calls



Bamboleo!



Gypsies: Bamboleo



Bambolea!



Gypsies: Bambolea



Fell the spirit move inside you

And take a chance



Bamboleo!



Gypsies: Bamboleo



Bambolea!



Gypsies: Bambolea



Can you hear her, calling, calling?

And so dance!



She's the moon

And the stars

When they are shining

Knowing all the answers

She sees into the shadows

She listens to the silence



And she calls, and she calls, and she calls

STOP

When she calls, when she calls



Inez & Gypsies:Bamboleo!

Bambolea!

Fell the spirit move inside you

And take a chance



Bamboleo (Bamboleo)

Bambolea (Bambolea)

Can you hear her, calling, calling?

And so dance!



Inez: She will reach you into your soul

She will take you deeper than you've ever been

And if you follow,

She will tell you all she's ever known

She will teach you who you are

And all that you mean



She will break into your heart

She will show you world's that you have that never seen

You'll feel her cast her spell

Reveal the hidden truth inside

She lives inside your dreams

The Gypsy Queen



Bamboleo!

Bambolea!

Feel the spirit move inside you

And take a chance



Bamboleo (Bamboleo)

Bambolea (Bambolea)



And she calls, and she calls, and she calls

She calls, and she calls, and she calls

She calls, and she calls, and she calls

She calls!



Bamboleo! Bamboleo! Bamboleo!
