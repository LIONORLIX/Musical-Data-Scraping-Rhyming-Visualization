Falling


Luisa:

Did I close my eyes

And dream that I was falling

Did I feel the wind?

Or hear the ocean calling?



Have I turned around

To find the world is spinning?

Have I lost my mind?

Or found a new beginning?



Luisa, it's a man you've never met

So don't fool yourself

Don't take risks that you'll regret.



Take a breath and count to three

Or maybe ten

Ooh, This isn't me

This is absurd

It can't be real

But why be afraid of what you feel?



For I closed my eyes

And dreamed that I was feelnig

And I felt the wind

And heard the ocean calling



Then I turned around

To see the world was spinning

Had I lost my mind

Or found a new beginning?



Silence

All the words we couldn't say

But we understood

Answers end but questions stay



Between the lights we've yet to read

And who can say

Where they may lead?

We take the risk or turn away



For I've learnt that charms

Mean nothing when they're spoken

And I don't need vows

When promises are broken



And I've always learnt

That mystery is revealing

And the truth is hard

If only one worth feeling



He is all I feel

Words are not in lies

Trust what isn't known

Dreams within their eyes, disguse

Take us by surpise



For I closed my eyes

And dreamed that I am falling

And I feel the wind

I hear the ocean calling



Then I turn around

To see the world is spinning

Have I lost my mind

Or found a new beginning?



When I close my eyes

I see open skies

And feel the ocean calling

And dream that I am falling

I hear a stranger calling me
