Nobody Cares


I wake up hung over

I go to bed smashed

Like an alcoholic hamster

On one of them little wheelie things



Every evening the same

Every morning the pain

I start drinking at 10

And by noon I'm not feeling things



And nobody cares what I'm talking about

(Oh shit I just gone thrown up in my mouth)

Just swallow it man

Just swallow it

Your opinions or your vomit

Either way they don't want it



(What's your point, what is your point)

And I think I had a point there

But the point is it don't matter

Cause it's pointless having points anyway, cause



Nobody cares what I say

Nobody cares what I do

What's the point of bothering if no-one else is bothered

I was born in this town and I'm gonna die here too



I wake with a headache

I take a piss I often miss

I often get a little bit on the floor



I eat a piece of toast

That I found toasted in the toaster

Then I goes to get my jacket by the rack by the back door



And then I get into my truck

I drive a block to Ralphy's shop

It's always shut he picks me up

And drives us up to running rock (?)



And shoot some cans and crack some cans

And shoot the breeze about the weather

Or a sports team or a car

And after that the bar



Nobody cares what I say

Nobody cares what I do

What's the point of bothering if no-one else is bothered

I was born in this town and I'm gonna die here too



I wake with a headache

I take a piss I often miss

I often get a little bit on the floor



I sometimes try to clean

The mess I makes from my mistakes

But for whose sakes

am I making all this 'F'ing effort for



I wake up each morning

In the same damn day

There seems to be jack shit

That I can do or say

I've got no voice I've got no vote

I've got no way to change a goddamn thing



(I think that's the pigs)

Who gives a fig



Nobody cares what I do

Nobody cares about my life

Utterly uninfluential

No regrets and no potential

Every turn inconsequential

Yeehaw let's drive



Nobody cares what I say

Nobody cares about my life

Utterly uninstrumental

No insurance, no intent

(Well actually, I've got dental)

Ok well that's nice



And I'm not sure what the point is

But the point is it don't matter

Point is it don't matter, cause



Nobody cares what I do

Nobody cares about my life

Utterly uninfluential

No regrets and no potential

Every turn inconsequential



And I'm not sure what the point is

But the point is it don't matter

Not sure what the point is

Point is it don't matter cause



Nobody cares what I do

Nobody cares about my life

Utterly uninfluential

No regrets and no potential

Every turn inconsequential



Utterly repercussion free

(Though arguably not for that tree)

(I think I pooped my dungaree)



No consequence at all
