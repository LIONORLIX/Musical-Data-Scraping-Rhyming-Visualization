Hope


There will be mornings you will be utterly defeated by your laces

Days where every look looks condescending

Empty smiles in empty faces

The same old places this stunning stasis



Just let your spirit slip away

Let all your troubles crumble and decay

There’s more than one way out if at the end of the day

You’re at the end of your rope



Never give up hope

Never let yourself be defeated

If you tried it once you can try again

A new day will follow

There’s always tomorrow



ENSEMBLE: never give up hope



Never listen to the unbelievers

You will take your falls

You will hit your walls

Don’t give into sorrow



ENSEMBLE: There’s always tomorrow



I never lasted farcical disaster

You play your part

You march the march

You don’t complain

You find a way

Another day

Surrounded by a cast of half-wit bastards

Grinning masks amidst the grey

Yet you stay sane and through the pain

The frozen pain of glass

You strain to cast your gaze upon the path you have to tread

And in your head that leaden dread

the fucking roads have all been trod

And there’s no way and there’s no God

And god oh god this goddamn weather

Will last forever but you must never, never, never



Never give up hope

Never let the odds overwhelm you

You know the game gets hard

Don’t throw in your cards

A new day will follow



ENSEMBLE: There’s always tomorrow



I’ve done everything I can

I’ve done my best and I

And I’ve tried so hard to find my way out of this mess but I

But I’m so tired

I swear to you I’ve tried

And sometimes I just want to give up

Just give up and stay here and live

But I know there’s no point in denying that I will keep trying

I’m a lot of things

But I’m not a quitter

I will never give up, never give up, never give up



Never give up hope

Never let yourself be defeated

You tried it once, you tried it again

There’s always tomorrow



ENSEMBLE: If it isn’t today have a little faith there’s always tomorrow



Hold on to your faith

You’ll find another way

After acid and gas and guns

And razors and rope

You may wanna live

But baby don’t give up

Hope
