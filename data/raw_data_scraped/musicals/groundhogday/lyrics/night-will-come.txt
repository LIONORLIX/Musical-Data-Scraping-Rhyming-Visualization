Night Will Come


On and on and on you stumble

Towards the evening sun

She waits for you with open arms

You stare right through her



On and on you fall towards her

Cold embracing shadow doorway

Offers nothing still she draws you ever to her



On and on and on you stumble towards the sinking sun

Turn a blind eye fight or run

Rest assured the night will come



On and on you grasp and guess

And search for patterns in the mess

Of what has been and what is left

To yet endure



The jester shrugs and plays his part

The fever fall see only dark

The pious with their hope filled hearts sing hallelujah



On and on and on you stumble towards the cooling sun

Turn a blind eye fight or run

Rest assured the night will come



All the love and all the gold

All you've built and all you've sold

All the power you may hold

You won't evade her



All the steel and all the bricks

All the math and magic tricks

All the carrots all the sticks

Will not dissuade her



On and on and on you stumble towards the fading sun

Turn a blind eye fight or run

Rest assured the night will come

Rest assured the night will come



As for that the rest is just a test of your endurance

You've gotta love life

You've gotta live life

You've gotta love life
