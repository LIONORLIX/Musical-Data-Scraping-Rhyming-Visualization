If I Had My Time Again


RITA HANSON

Sometimes, it's like I'm stumbling forward

Hustled forward

Jostled from behind by time



Sometimes, it's like I'm being dragged

Yet always lagging

Trying to keep in time with time



But if I could stop the clock for just one day

If I could freeze a moment for a moment

Rest before the measure's over

Hold the beat for just one day

If I could wind it back and start afresh

Just a day to catch my breath

To make mistakes and set them right

Delay the coming of the night



If I had my time again

I would do it all the same

They say, but that's insane

Wouldn't you want to make a couple of changes?

Regrets, I'd not even have a few

If I could do this thing that you

Say you can do.

I've always dreamt of learning how to dance



PHIL CONNORS

Some days I go out without pants



RITA

It's so exciting



PHIL

I slept with ninety



RITA

A new beginning



PHIL

Percent of women



RITA

Every morning



PHIL

In Punxsutawney



RITA

To have the time to strive for more



PHIL

Between eighteen and eighty-four

And one dude when I was bored



RITA

If I had my time again

I'd take the path less trodden

Avoid the crap I trod in

Read a lot of books



PHIL

I've stolen eighteen million bucks



RITA

And I would worry less about my nose looks



PHIL

And I guess I'll do it again



RITA

And I would be a lot more zen



PHIL

When



RITA

And I would punch



PHIL

I



RITA

A lot of men



PHIL

Had



RITA

If I had



RITA & PHIL

My time again



RITA

If I had my time again

I would do it all the same

They claim, that that's ridiculous

Surely you'd want to make a couple of fixes?

All those boxes left unchecked

All the dreams you left neglected

You'd go back and put it right

I've always fancied learning how to climb



PHIL

I once masturbated seven times



RITA

I'd study math



PHIL

In the bath



RITA

And search for meaning



PHIL

In one evening



RITA

And I'd run up hills



PHIL

It wasn't fun, but still



RITA

I'd learn to paint



PHIL

A man my age [RITA]

Just to know [PHIL]

It's nice to know [RITA & PHIL]

I can



PHIL

It's nice to know I can



RITA

If I had my time again

I'd sample all the samples

Look at things from different angles

I would not do it all the same

If I had my time again



RITA & ENSEMBLE

If I had my time again



RITA

The things I'd handle better

I would send my unsent letters



PHIL

I've started seven hundred fights



RITA

If I had my time back



PHIL

And if you knew the endless nights

That I have wasted getting wasted

Contemplating different ways to suicide



RITA

I would write and I would write



PHIL

And I have tried every food and every drink and every cheat [RITA]

And I would add joy to other people's lives

And I would learn piano

And I would make a lot of friends

If I had my time [PHIL]

And every choice a thousand times

And I daily eat about a dozen donuts and I don't know why

And I don't know... why? [RITA & COMPANY]

If I had my time again [RITA]

I'd open all the doors I've never looked behind

And oh, the thing I'd taste, the things I'd try



And the misery I could prevent



And I will make a lot of friends

If I had my time

Again [PHIL]

I've opened all the doors I'd never looked behind

And oh I

I find the thing with these revolving rhymes



They're only fun cause you know they're going to end



Again, I have had it, I have had my time again
