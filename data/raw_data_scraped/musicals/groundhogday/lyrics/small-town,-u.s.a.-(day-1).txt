Who is that (who is that)

emerging from his burrow?

Who can see today what we won't see until tomorrow

Shaman of the shadows, springer of the spring

RADIO - FEMALE

PHIL

Lumpy bed, ugly curtains

Pointless erection

Dried flowers, damp towels

No reception

Small towns, tiny minds

Big mouths, small ideas

RADIO - MALE

Now the question on everyone's lips



RADIO - FEMALE

Chapped lips



RADIO - MALE

Do you think Phil will see his shadow?



PHIL

I mean, whats not to like in a quaint like this

Who doesn't dig a crocheted pillowcase like this

Watercolors of bucolic vistas, painted by octogenarian spinsters and

All of the people just getting together for

relentless analysis of the weather their

dumb superstitions and vacuous chat

I'm sure there was a pack of Xanax in this jacket

You couldn't pay me to stay here one more night

swear that there is no cheque you could write that might tempt me to stay and wake up in the morning in



CHORUS

Punxsutawney

Ba-da-bap-bap-ba-da-da-ba-da



PHIL

There's nothing more depressing than, small town USA

and small don't come much smaller than Punxsutawney on Groundhog Day



(Interlude)



CHORUS

Ba-da-bap-bap-ba-da-da-ba-da



PHIL

There's nothing more depressing than, small town USA

and small don't come much smaller than



PHIL & CHORUS

Punxsutawney on Groundhog Day



PHIL

I've not a bad word to say about small towns per-say

They're nice for an hour or at a stretch, half a day

And they're perfect for a stop off on your way, on your way to somewhere else

Pretty much ... anywhere else

And I've no qualm at all with your small town people

I admire their balls getting out of bed at all

to face another day in a shit hole this small

All haystacks and horses where there should be golf courses and



One bar one store one clock

One diner one bank one cop



How can they bear it to live in a place like this

Separate from the whole human race like this

One little store selling plaid shirts and rakes

And it's huntin' and fishin' and half-pounder steaks

And if I have a hope of a better career than this

This is the last time I'm broadcasting here, Jesus

I have been forecasting too many years to be talking to hicks about magical beavers

When I'm done I'm gonna call up the station and tell them I'm through with this crap

And never again will I wake in the morning in



CHORUS

Punxsutawney

It's a little town with a heart as big as any town, as any small town

in the USA and there is no town greater than Punxsutawney on Groundhog Day



PHIL

Tomorrow I'll wake and I'll call up the station and tell them I'm not coming back

and never again will I wake in the morning in



CHORUS

Every morning I wake to the dawning of



PHIL

Never again will I wake in the morning in



CHORUS & PHIL

Punxsutawney



CHORUS

It's a little town with a heart as big as any town



PHIL

There's nothing more depressing than small town, USA

and there is no town smaller than Punxsutawney on Groundhog

There's nothing more depressing than small town, USA

and there is no town smaller than

Punxsutawney on

Punxsutawney on

Punxsutawney on



CHORUS

Groundhog



PHIL

Just kill me now



CHORUS

Day



(Interlude)



CHORUS

Who is that (who is that?)

Emerging from his burrow

Who can see today what we won't see until tomorrow

Shaman of the shadows, springer of the spring

Is it a squirrel? Is it a beaver?



NED

Kinda both but not quite either



CHORUS

All the meteorologists the world has ever known

Cannot match this little guy's uncanny skill

We can guess but we won't know if we should dress for sun or snow

until we hear it from old Punxsutawney Phil



GROUNDHOG HANDLER

Every year for a hundred years

we've bent our heads and lent our ears

To listen to his famed prognostication

Lucky for you I speak with ease

both English and Groundhogese

Please stand by for imminent translation



CHORUS

This brown log containeth one Groundhog

the famous Philip of Punxsutawney

gifted sniffer of future mornings

The finest specimen you will find of Rodentia Sciuridae

our own uncanny whistlepig

The groundest hog that ever lived

A hundred years and he is still

the pride of Punxsutawney

The prophet of the age

Prognosticating Punxsutawney Phil



Who is that (who is that?)

Emerging from his burrow

Who can see today what we won't see until tomorrow

Shaman of the shadows, springer of the spring

Is it a squirrel? Is it a beaver?



NED

Kinda both but not quite either



CHORUS

All the meteorologists the world has ever known

Cannot match this little guy's uncanny skill

We can guess but we won't know if we should dress for sun or snow

until we hear it from old Punxsutawney Phil



GROUNDHOG HANDLER

Punxsutawney Phil, Seer of Seers, Prognosticator of prognosticators

Has declared in Groundhogese

That he did indeed see his shadow

Six more weeks of winter



CHORUS

Awwww. Yaaay



All the meteorologists the world has ever known

Cannot match this little guy's uncanny skill

We can guess but we won't know if we should dress for sun or snow

until we hear it from old Punxsutawney Phil



RITA

February second, first remote broadcast

GHD in Punx, PA

Unexpected weather

Seems we're staying here for another night

Which is, kind of fine

It's a sweet town and people are kind and

The bartender's kinda hot

Hopefully tomorrow, the roads will be cleared and we can go home

Working with Phil Connors

They all told me he would be an asshole ... and he is

Luckily he's funny ... ish

Thinks he's too good for this



CHORUS

Tomorrow spring will come (spring will come)

There will be blue skies my friend

Bright eyes and laughter

Tomorrow there will be sun (there will be sun)

But if not tomorrow perhaps the day after
