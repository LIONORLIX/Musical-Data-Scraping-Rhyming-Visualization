One Day


RITA:

I was brought up in tafetta dresses

And taught to be pretty and precious

Spending my playtimes with plastic princesses

Who all had bodies just utterly ludicrous

Miniscual waists and huge boobs

And it's all nippless and no creases

I mean Jesus it's pretty confusing

Especially at 6.



In that fairytale world all the girls end up happy ever after.

Wooing their knights in shining armour.

But some nights down the track

You can bet they'll be trapped

Spending nights 'n shining armour.



While their knights spend their nights at the bar

Or at a ball with some harlot

I'm not bitter it's just better

That I don't fall for all that romantic bullshit

Now that I'm older.

Though I don't mind the thought of being tossed over a shoulder

And trotted off to a mansion by some ruggedly handsome man in a fireman helmet

And have him just use me for sex.

As I say - it's a little complex.



One day, some day

my prince may come

But it doesn't seem likely

But even if he came and he liked me

It's likely he'd be not quite my type.



Some day, they say

He'll come ridin' up on the back of a horse

But of course

I'm allergic to horses

How will I tell him

He'll just have to sell him.



I went to school with a girl

I remember her well

She was pretty smart - and pretty as hell

Her folks had a farm

But she wouldn't stay of course

She wanted prince charming

So she went to LA of course

Managed to seduce a

Famous actor or producer

Shacked up in a house in the hills

With a cat and a juicer

- and a fancy car

- and a tennis court.

But the guy wasn't quite

The catch she'd thought she caught.

He treats her like trash

Then you know the drill

Takes his cat and his cash

And finds some younger girl

So she's left with a stupid corvette

And an empty swimming pool

Which she fills with regret

Smart girl but kinda dumb...



And I'd rather be lonely

Than sit on my fanny

Waiting for my prince to come-



One day, some day

He'll come sweeping in

And sweep me off my feet

And spend the next 4 decades

Wanting to cheat on me

Getting less handsom

And fighting his dragons.



He'd know what to wear

He'd have a full head of hair

And his eyes would be brown

Or blue.

Or green.

Well, I dont care.

And his body would be toned with those

Pecks you get at the gym

But he won't spend all of his time at the gym.

And he'll love reading books,

He'll be an excellent cook,

He'll be good looking but not to aware of his looks.

He'll be tender but tough

And smart but not smug

And attentive but not fawning

And he'll smell good in the morning

- 'n he'll dance,

-and like hiking and baking

And biking I'm not picky

I just ask that he likes me

And I like him and I'd rather be alone

If the only other option

Is to come and settly down

With some condescending clown

With a great rating from some dating service

Some self professing Mr. Perfect

Another narcissistic legend

Made a million out of hedge funds

Another sexually inaffectual

Self-obsessing metrosexual

Pseudo-intellectual

Getting drunk and existential.

Every time the steelers lose a game

Thanks - but perhaps another day.



One day, some day

My prince may come

But I won't hold my breath

There's only divorcees

And wierdos left

And weird is fine

But not all the time

One day,

Someday my prince will come

So the fairytale said

30 years later it's still in my head

That if I screw a frog

I will wake up in a four poster bed.



PHIL (and Joelle):

There was a day with a girl (there was a day)

I remember it well (with a girl)

Her name was Jenean

Or Jenna,

Or Joelle (it's Joelle)

We drank piña coladas

Watched the sun setting over the bay (watched the sun setting over the Bay"

We made love in the sand (We made love in the sand)

and when we were through (when we were through)

We went back to her room (back to my room)

And watched Ghostbusters 2 (Ghostbusters 2)

Smoked half a joint (smoked half a joint)

And ate half a pound of pâté (it was way too much pâté)

Why couldn't that be my one day



Jeff (and female):

(one day some day) I'll cut down on fried chicken takeaway

(One day) my doctor said (one day) my heart will stop tickin'

unless I cut down on that chicken

I will do it (one day)



Gus (and ensemble):

(one day) I'll stop drinking so much



Nancy: I'll stop dating guys who are 20 years older



Sheriff (and ensemble): (one day) I'll get a new safety clip for my holster

I'll do it next week



Mrs. Lancaster (and ensemble): (One day) I'll get a new coffee maker



Buster (and ensemble): Some (one) day (day) I will buy her a ring



Ned? (and ensemble): One day (day) death will come to everyone (everyone)



Doris: (One day) I'll learn how to sing



(Rita) {and ensemble} and Phil:

{(One day)}These Endless first dates

{(Someday)} that start with her (my prince may come) hating me



Phil and Rita (and ensemble):

But it just doesn't seem likely (ahhhhhh)



Phil: that I'm gonna get her to like me



Rita: [spoken] Phil, you bought me candy!



Phil: [spoken] I bought you candies

[sung] can I get in your panties now?



Phil (and Rita): (One day) is not enough (some day) I've had enough

(I will wake in the arms) I'm not enough I'm not your (of an actual) fictional (man)

I'm just me, I can't be (who will be more than I) am (ask)

(If all that he is) this is all that there is



Larry [spoken] (and ensemble):

Okay we're on in (one day) 5, 4, (one day) 3, 2, (one day)....

Okay Phil we're on in 5, (one day), 4, (one day) 3, 2 (one day)...

Okay we're on in (one day) 5, 4, (one day) 3, 2, (one day), 2....



Phil: [spoken]: What 'd ya know, it's Groundhog Day



Ensemble: [sung] tomorrow spring will come

And then

There will be blue skies my friend

Bright eyes and laughter



(tomorrow) people can curse, (Spring will come) cast spells and cry,

(tomorrow) Offer your prayers to the unfeeling sky (There will be blue skies my friend)

(Tomorrow) Spring will arrive (bright eyes and) when the winter is done (laughter)

And if it's not tomorrow (and tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow.......)
