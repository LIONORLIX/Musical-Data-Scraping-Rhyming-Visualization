RADIO

Who is that (who is that)

emerging from his burrow?

Who can see today what we won't see until tomorrow

Shaman of the shadows, springer of the spring

RADIO - MALE & FEMALE HOSTS

Is it a squirrel? Is it a beaver?

Kinda both but not quite either

RADIO - ???

*squeaky noise*



PHIL

I'll tell Larry to take the 220 via Bayer and Keystone lake

If we hurry, I'll be drinking decent coffee by 9 or even half past 8

And never again will I wake in the morning in Puuuuunx-



CHORUS/TOWNSFOLK

Punxatawney!



PHIL & CHORUS/TOWNSFOLK

Ba-da-bap-bap-ba-da-



PHIL

Suck my balls I'm out!



CHORUS/TOWNSFOLK

Punxatawney, Pennsylvania, USA!



PHIL

Okay

One I'm still sleeping and this, I'm just dreaming it

Two it's a prank and everyone's in on it

Three it's a flashback from when I was twenty and ate magic mushrooms

and thought I was *Aquaman*



Four it's some kind of reality show about forecasters, bad bed-and-breakfasts, and, snow

Five I've had a stroke and lost my memory of the year since last Groundhog Day



Come on Phil wake up, get it together, it must be the weather it must be the stress!

I just need a moment I just need a rest!



CHORUS/TOWNSFOLK

Punxsutawney

It's a little town with a heart as big as any town, as any small town

in the USA and there is no town greater

than Punxsutawney on Groundhog, Groundhog, Groundhog



CHORUS/TOWNSFOLK

Who is that (who is that?)

Emerging from his burrow

Who can see today what we won't see until tomorrow

Shaman of the shadows, springer of the spring

Is it a squirrel? Is it a beaver?



PRESIDENT OF THE INNER CIRCLE

Kinda both but not quite either



CHORUS/TOWNSFOLK

All the meteorologists the world has ever known

Cannot match this little guy's uncanny skill

We can guess but we won't know if we should dress for sun or snow

until we hear it from old Punxsutawney Phil



PHIL

I'm going back to bed!



RITA

February second, first remote broadcast

GHD in Punx, PA

Working with Phil Connors

They all told me he would be an asshole ... and he is

I mean, he acts kinda asshole-ish, still

I think he might be... mentally ill



CHORUS

Tomorrow spring will come (spring will come)

There will be blue skies my friend

Bright eyes and laughter

Tomorrow there will be sun (there will be sun)

But if not tomorrow perhaps the day after



RITA

Unexpected weather

Seems we're staying here for another night

Which is, kind of fine
