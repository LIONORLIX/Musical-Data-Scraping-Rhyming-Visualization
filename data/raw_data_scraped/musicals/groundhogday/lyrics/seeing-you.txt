Seeing You


PHIL

Drove out of town, took a right onto a northbound highway

Was it really only yesterday?

If I had known what now I know maybe I



COMPANY

Ooooh



PHIL

Would have taken a moment

Maybe looked over my shoulder

Maybe shed a tear

Now I'm here

A storm rolled in, overwhelmed me sometime late this morning



PHIL AND COMPANY

Think I ignored the warning



PHIL

I spent a lifetime seeking signs, reading lines



COMPANY

Ahhhh



PHIL

Trying to forecast the future

Always stayed a day ahead



PHIL AND COMPANY

Well that was the idea



PHIL

But I'm here



PHIL AND COMPANY

I thought I'd seen it all



PHIL

But sure by now I knew this place



COMPANY

Ahhhh



PHIL AND COMPANY

I swear that I knew every hair



PHIL

Each line upon your face



PHIL AND COMPANY

I thought the only way



PHIL

To better days was through tomorrow



PHIL AND COMPANY

But I know now that I know

I know now that I know nothing



PHIL

But I'm here

And I'm fine

And I'm seeing you, for the first time

I'm alright

I'm seeing you, for the first time



PHIL AND RITA

I thought I'd seen it all before

I thought I knew everything



RITA

There was to know



PHIL

There was to know



RITA

About men like you



PHIL

And I was sure



PHIL & RITA

I thought the only way to better days was through tomorrow



PHIL, RITA & COMPANY

But I know now, that I know

Yes, I know now, that I know

That I'm here

And I'm fine

And I'm seeing you for the first time

I'm alright and I'm seeing you
