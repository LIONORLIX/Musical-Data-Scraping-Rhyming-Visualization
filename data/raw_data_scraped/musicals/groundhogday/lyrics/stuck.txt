Stuck


I have a degree (That's nice)

In alternative therapy (Okay)

Took an online course for a week or two (Maybe we should-)

I think we should begin with a nice bit of Reiki (Reiki?)

Unblock your chi (What's chi?)

It's dooby-dooby tralala

It's holistic therapy (what does that mean?)

It's energy

Vibrations and something magnets

And doopy-didd?)ly pa-pa-pa

Now piss (what?), piss (I just-), piss into this (I don't have any-)

I'll analyse your isotopes and something something quantum quantum

(I'm stuck, I'm just-)

I think you're allergic to gluten

(Stuck. I'm, it's like I feel like I'm trapped in a loop)

(Like I'm stuck in time)

Well I think cutting out gluten (I'm-) is the smartest solution (Fine)

Better a diet of soup (Soup?)

Made of rhino foreskin

(I think I've lost my mind)

(I can't seem to find my way out of-)

An enema (what?), would you like an enema?

(Existentially I'm-)

Some essential oils

(Essentially I'm-)

Organic teas?

(Who needs enemas with friends like-)

I don't even know if I believe what I'm saying

This guy is clearly nuts but he is desperate and he's paying

Statistically he might as well be sitting home and praying

For all the good that I can do, I don't have a fricking clue what I'm doing

Though there are things that we just don't know

It doesn't mean you shouldn't give giving an answer a go

Now open your buttocks a wee bit

(I'm not sure how this will help)

I just want to get to the bottom of it

(I'm stuck. I'm just stuck)

I have a PhD (Finally!)

In psychiatric pharmacology

I specialize in mental illness... (Good!)

In cows (wha?)

Let's treat your depression with a course of fluoxetol

(I'm not depressed)

You're not?

(No!)

You must be delusional, so take some acepromazine and a couple of procaprimine

And quietly I'd advise ya, to try this tranquiliser

Although maybe you should just take half (okay)

It says whole ones for cows (I'm not a-)

And half for calves (right.)

I don't even know if I believe what I'm saying

This guy is clearly nuts but he is desperate and he's paying

Statistically he might as well be sitting home and praying

For all the good that I can do, I don't have a fricking clue

In my medicine cupboard

There's a bunch of L.Ron Hubbard

[There are only twelve steps and they shouldn't take long]

We just need a sample of your stool and your semen

You have Satan within you

We must exorcise your demons

Take this pill

Read this book

Eat your vegetables uncooked

It's your karma

It's just toxins

It's for constipated oxens

Well that oughta loosen you up

(I am stuuuck... fuck okay)



(One I'm still sleeping and this I'm just dreaming it, two it's a prank

and everyone's in on it, three it's a flashback from when I was twenty

and ate magic mushrooms and thought I was Aquaman,

four it's some kind of reality show, five it's amnesia, six it's a stroke!)



(I think I am losing my mind)



That'll be 500 bucks!

(What the fu-)

A cheque is fine!

(Fine)



Karma!

Toxins!

Enema!

Oxen!

Jesus!
