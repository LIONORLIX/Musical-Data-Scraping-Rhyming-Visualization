Hello, Little Girl


[WOLF]

Good day, young lady.



[LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD]

Good day, Mr. Wolf.



[WOLF]

Mmmh...

Unhh...



Look at that flesh,

Pink and plump.

Hello, little girl...



Tender and fresh,

Not one lump.

Hello, little girl...



This one's especially lush,

Delicious...

Mmmh...



Hello, little girl,

What's your rush?

You're missing all the flowers.

The sun won't set for hours,

Take your time.



[LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD]

Mother said,

"Straight ahead,"

Not to delay or be misled.



[WOLF]

But slow, little girl,

Hark and hush-

The birds are singing sweetly.

You'll miss the birds completely,

You're traveling so fleetly.



Grandmother first,

Then Miss Plump...

What a delectable couple:

Utter perfection-

One brittle, one supple-

One moment, my dear-!



[LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD]

Mother said,

"Come what may,

Follow the path

And never stray."



[WOLF]

Just so, little girl-

Any path.

So many worth exploring.

Just one would be so boring.

And look what you're ignoring...



Think of those crisp,

Aging bones,

Then something fresh on the palate,

Think of that scrumptious carnality

Twice in one day-!

There's no possible way

To describe what you feel

When you're talking to your meal.



[LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD]

Mother said

Not to stray.

Still I suppose,

A small delay...

Granny might like

A fresh bouquet...



Goodbye, Mr. Wolf.



[WOLF]

Goodbye, little girl.

And hello...
