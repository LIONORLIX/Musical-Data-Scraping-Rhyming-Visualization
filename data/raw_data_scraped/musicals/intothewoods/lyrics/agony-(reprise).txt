Agony (Reprise)


[CINDERELLA'S PRINCE

High in a tower-

Like yours was, but higher-

A beauty asleep.

All round the tower

A thicket of briar

A hundred feet deep.



Agony!

No frustration mor keen,

When the one thing you want

Is a thing that you've not even seen.



RAPUNZEL'S PRINCE

I found a casket

Entirely of glass-

No, it's unbreakable.

Inside- don't ask it-

A maiden, alas,

Just as unwakable-



BOTH

What unmistakable agony!

Is the way always barred?



RAPUNZEL'S PRINCE

She has skin white as snow-



CINDERELLA'S PRINCE

Did you learn her name?



RAPUNZEL'S PRINCE

No,

There's a dwarf standing guard.



BOTH

Agony!

Such that Princes must weep!

Always in thrall most

To anything almost,

Or something asleep.



CINDERELLA'S PRINCE

If it were not for the thicket-



RAPUNZEL'S PRINCE

A thicket's no trick.

Is it thick?



CINDERELLA'S PRINCE

It's the thickest.



RAPUNZEL'S PRINCE

The quickest

Is pick it

Apart with a stick-



CINDERELLA'S PRINCE

yes, but even one prick-

It's my thing about blood.



RAPUNZEL'S PRINCE

Well, it's sick!



CINDERELLA'S PRINCE

It's no sicker

Than you thing with dwarves.



RAPUNZEL'S PRINCE

Dwarfs.



CINDERELLA'S PRINCE

Dwarfs...



RAPUNZEL'S PRINCE

Dwarfs are every upsetting.



BOTH

Not forgetting

The tasks unacheivable,

Mountains unscalable-

If it's conceivable

But unavailable,

Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh-



Agony!



CINDERELLA'S PRINCE

Misery!



BOTH

Not to know what you miss.



CINDERELLA'S PRINCE

While they lie there for years-



RAPUNZEL'S PRINCE

And you cry on their biers-



BOTH

What unbearable bliss!

Agony

That can cut like a knife!



Ah, well, back to my wife...
