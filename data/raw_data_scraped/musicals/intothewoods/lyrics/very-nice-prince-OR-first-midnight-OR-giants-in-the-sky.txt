Very Nice Prince / First Midnight / Giants in the Sky


Very Nice Prince



[CINDERELLA]

He's a very nice Prince.



[BAKER'S WIFE]

And-?



[CINDERELLA]

And-

It's a very nice ball.



[BAKER'S WIFE]

And-?



[CINDERELLA]

And-

When I entered they trumpeted.



[BAKER'S WIFE]

And-?

The Prince-?



[CINDERELLA]

Oh, the Prince...



[BAKER'S WIFE]

Yes, the Prince!



[CINDERELLA]

Well, he's tall.



[BAKER'S WIFE]

Is that all?

Did you dance?

Is he charming? They say that he's charming.



[CINDERELLA]

We did nothing but dance.



[BAKER'S WIFE]

Yes-? And-?



[CINDERELLA]

And it made a nice change.



[BAKER'S WIFE]

No, the Prince!



[CINDERELLA]

Oh, the Prince...



[BAKER'S WIFE]

Yes, the Prince.



[CINDERELLA]

He has charm for a Prince, I guess...



[BAKER'S WIFE]

guess?



[CINDERELLA]

I don't meet a wide range.



[BAKER'S WIFE]

Did he bow?

Was he cold and polite?



[CINDERELLA]

And it's all very strange.



[BAKER'S WIFE]

Did he speak? Did he flirt?

Could you tell right away he was royalty?

Is he sensitive,

Clever,

Well-mannered,

Considerate,

Passionate,

Charming,

As kind as he's handsome,

As wise as he's rich,

Is he everything you've ever wanted?



[CINDERELLA]

Would I know?



[BAKER'S WIFE]

Well, I know.



[CINDERELLA]

But how can you know what you want

Till you get what you want

And you see if you like it?



[BAKER'S WIFE]

Would I know?



[CINDERELLA]

All I know is-



[BAKER'S WIFE]

I never wish-



[CINDERELLA]

What I want most of all-



[BAKER'S WIFE]

Just within reason.



[CINDERELLA]

Is to know what I want.



[BAKER'S WIFE]

When you know you can't have what you want,

Where's the profit in wishing?



[BOTH]

He's a very nice Prince...



[BAKER'S WIFE]

What I wouldn't give to be in your shoes.



[CINDERELLA]

Will you look over there, an enormous beanstalk

growing next to that little cottage.



[BAKER'S WIFE]

I mean slippers as pure as gold.



[CINDERELLA]

I must get home.



[BAKER'S WIFE]

I need you shoes.



Wait!



First Midnight



[BAKER]

One midnight gone...



[MYSTERIOUS MAN]

No know unties itself...



[WITCH]

Sometimes the things you most wish for are not

to be touched...



[PRINCES]

The harder to get, the better to have...



[FLORINDA]

Never wear mauve at a ball...



[LUCINDA]

Or pink...



[STEPMOTHER]

Or open your mouth...



[JACK]

The difference between a cow and a bean

Is a bean can begin an adventure...



[JACK'S MOTHER]

Slotted spoons don't hold much soup...



[LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD]

The prettier the flower, the farther from the path...



[CINDERELLA'S FATHER]

The closer to the family, the closer to the wine...



[RAPUNZEL]

Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah...



[WITCH]

One midnight gone!...



[GRANNY]

The mouth of a wolf's not the end of the world...



[STEWARD]

A servant is not just a dog, to a Prince...



[CINDERELLA]

Opportunity is not a lengthy visitor...



[BAKER'S WIFE]

You may know what you need,

But to get what you want,

Better see that you keep what you have.



[BAKER]

One midnight gone...



[WITCH]

Sometimes the things you most wish for are not

to be touched...



[PRINCES]

The harder to get,

The better to have...

Agreed.



[BAKER]

One midnight gone... one midnight gone...



[FLORINDA]

Never wear mauve at a ball...



[LUCINDA]

Or pink...



[JACK'S MOTHER]

Slotted spoons don't hold much soup...



[BAKER'S WIFE]

To get what you want,

Better keep what you...



[LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD]

The prettier the flower...



[ALL]

One midnight gone...



Into the woods,

Into the woods,

Into the woods, then out of the woods

And home before



Giants in the Sky



[JACK]

There are Giants in the sky!

There are big tall terrible Giants

in the sky!



When you're way up high

And you look below

At the world you left

And the things you know,

Little more than a glance

Is enough to show

You just how small you are.



When you're way up high

And you're own your own

In a world like none

That you've ever known,

Where the sky is lead

And the earth is stone,



You're free, to do

Whatever pleases you,

Exploring things you'd never dare

'Cause you don't care,

When suddenly there's



A big tall terrible Giant at the door,

A big tall terrible lady Giant

sweeping the floor.

And she gives you food

And she gives you rest

And she draws you close

To her Giant breast,

And you know things now

that you never knew before,

Not till the sky.



Only just when you've made

A friend and all,

And you know she's big

But you don't feel small,

Someone bigger than her

Comes along the hall

To swallow you for lunch.



And you heart is lead

And your stomach stone

And you're really scared

Being all alone...



And it's then that you miss

All the things you've known

And the world you've left

And the little you own-



The fun is done.

You steal what you can and run.

And you scramble down

And you look below,

And the world you know

Begins to grow:



The roof, the house, and your Mother at the door.

The roof, the house and the world you never thought to explore.

And you think of all of the things you've seen,

And you wish that you could live in between,

And you're back again,

Only different than before,

After the sky.



There are Giants in the sky!

There are big tall terrible awesome scary wonderful

Giants in the sky!
