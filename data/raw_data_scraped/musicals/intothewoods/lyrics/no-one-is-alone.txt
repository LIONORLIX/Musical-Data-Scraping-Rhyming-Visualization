No One Is Alone


Cinderella:

Mother cannot guide you.

Now you're on your own.

Only me beside you.

Still, you're not alone.

No one is alone.  Truly.

No one is alone.

Sometimes people leave you.

Halfway through the wood.

Others may decieve you.

You decide whats good.

You decide alone.

But no one is alone.

LRRH:

I wish..

Cinderella:

I know.

Mother isn't here now

Baker:

Wrong things, right things

Cinderella:

Who knows what she'd say?

Baker:

Who can say what's true?

Cinderella:

Nothings quite so clear now.

Baker:

Do things, fight things,

Cinderella:

Feel you've lost your way?

Baker:

You decide, but

Both:

You are not alone

Cinderella:

Believe me,

No one is alone

Baker:

No one is alone.

Believe me.

Cinderella:

Truly

Both:

You move just a finger,

Say the slightest word,

Somethings bound to linger

Be heard

Baker:

No acts alone.

Careful.

No one is alone.

Both:

People make mistakes.

Baker:

Fathers,

Cinderella:

Mothers,

Both:

People make mistakes,

Holding to their own,

Thinking their alone.

Cinderella:

Honor their mistakes



Cinderella:

Everybody makes



Baker:

Fight for their mistakes



Both:

One another's terrible mistakes.

Witches can be right, Giants can be good.

You decide what's right you decide what's good

Cinderella:

Just remember:

Baker:

[Echo] Just remember:

Both:

Someone is on your side

Jack, LRRH:

OUR side

Baker, Cinderella:

Our side--

Someone else is not

While we're seeing our side

Jack, LRRH:

Our side..

Baker, Cinderella:

Our side--

All:

Maybe we forgot: they are not alone.

No one is alone.

Cinderella:

Hard to see the light now.

Baker:

Just don't let it go

Both:

Things will come out right now.

We can make it so.

Someone is on your side-- [interrupted]
