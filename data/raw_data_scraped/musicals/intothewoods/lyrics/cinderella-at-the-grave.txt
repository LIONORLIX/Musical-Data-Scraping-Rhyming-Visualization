Cinderella at the Grave


[NARRATOR]

Cinderella had planted a branch at the grave of her Mother,

and many tear had watered it until it had become

a handsome tree.



[CINDERELLA]

I've been good and I've been kind, Mother,

Doing only what I learned from you.

Why then am I left behind, Mother,

Is there something more that I should do?

What is wrong with me, Mother?

Something must be wrong.

I wish-



[CINDERELLA'S MOTHER]

Do you know what you wish?

Are you certain what you wish

Is what you want?

if you know what you want,

Then make a wish.

Ask the tree,

And you shall have your wish.



[CINDERELLA]

Shiver and quiver, little tree,

Silver and gold throw down on me.

I'm off to get my wish...
