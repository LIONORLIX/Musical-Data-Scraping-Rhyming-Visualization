I Guess This Is Goodbye / Maybe They're Magic


[NARRATOR]

And the Baker gave Jack five beans in exchange for his cow,

keeping one for himself.



[JACK]

I guess this is goodbye, old pal,

You've been a perfect friend.

I hate to have to part, old pal,

Some day I'll buy you back.

I'll see you soon again.

I hope that when I do,

It won't be on a plate.



Maybe They're Magic



[BAKER]

Magic beans!



[BAKER'S WIFE]

No one would have given him more

for this creature.



[BAKER]

Are we to dispel this curse through deceit?



[BAKER'S WIFE]

If you know

What you want,

Then you go

And you find it

And you get it-



[BAKER]

Home.



[BAKER'S WIFE]

Do we want a child or not?



And you give

And you take

And you bid

And you bargain

Or youl ive

To regret it.



[BAKER]

Will you please go home?



[BAKER'S WIFE]

There are rights and wrongs

And in-betweens-

No one waits

When fortune intervenes.

Amd maybe they're really magic,

Who knows?



Why you do

What you do,

That's the point:

All the rest of it

Is chatter.



[BAKER]

Look at her. She's crying.



[BAKER'S WIFE]

If the thing you do

Is pure in intent,

If it's meant,

And it's just a little bent,

Does it matter?



[BAKER]

Yes.



[BAKER'S WIFE]

No, what matters is that

Everyone tells tiny lies.

What's important, really is, the size.



Only three more tries and we'll have our prize.

When the end's in sight,

You'll realize:

If the end is right,

It justifies

The beans!
