Ever After


NARRATOR

And it came to pass, all that seemed wrong

was now right, and those who deserved to

were certain to live a long and happy life.

Ever after...



COMPANY

Ever after!



NARRATOR

Journey over, all is mended,

And it's not just for today,

But tomorrow, and extended

Ever after!



COMPANY

Ever after!



NARRATOR

All the curses have been ended,

The reverses wiped away.

All is tenderness and laughter

For forever after!



COMPANY

Happy now and happy hence

And happy ever after!



NARRATOR

There were dangers-



COMPANY

We were frightened-



NARRATOR

And confusions-



COMPANY

But we hid it-



NARRATOR

And the paths would often swerve.



COMPANY

We did not.



NARRATOR

There were constant-



COMPANY

It's amazing-



NARRATOR

Disillusions-



COMPANY

That we did it.



NARRATOR

But they never lost they're nerve.



COMPANY

Not a lot.



NARRATOR AND COMPANY

And they/we reached the right conclusions

And they/we got what they/we deserved!



ALL

Not a sigh and not a sorrow,

Tenderness and laughter.

Joy today and bliss tomorrow,

And forever after!



FLORINDA

I was greedy.



LUCINDA

I was vain.



FLORINDA

I was haughty.



LUCINDA

I was smug.



BOTH

We were happy.



LUCINDA

It was fun.



FLORINDA

But we were blind.



BOTH

Then we went into the woods

To get our wish,

And now we're really blind.



WITCH

I was perfect.

I had everything but beauty.

I had power,

And a daughter like a flower,

In a tower.

Then I went into the woods

To get my wish,

And now I'm ordinary.

Lost my power and my flower.



FLORINDA AND LUCINDA

We're unworthy.



FLORINDA, LUCINDA, WITCH

We're/I'm unhappy now, unhappy hence,

As well as ever after.

Had we used our common sense,

Been worthy of our discontents,

We'd be happy.



ALL

To be happy, and forever,

You must see your wish come true.

Don't be careful, don't be clever.

When you see your wish, pursue.

It's a dangerous endeavor,

But the only thing to do-



Though it's fearful,

Though it's deep, though it's dark,

And though you may lose your path,

Though you may encounter wolves,

You mustn't stop,

You mustn't swerve,

You mustn't ponder,

You have to act!

When you know your wish,

If you want your wish,

You can have your wish,-

No, to get your wish



You go into the woods,

Where nothing's clear,

Where witches, ghosts

And wolves appear.

Into the woods

And through the fear,

You have to take the journey.



Into the woods

And down the dell,

In vain, perhaps,

But who can tell?

Into the woods to lift the spell,

Into the woods to lose the longing,

Into the woods to have the child,

To wed the Prince,

To get the money,

to save the house,

To kill the Wolf,

To find the father,

To conquer the kingdom,

To have, to wed,

To get, to save,

To kill, to keep,

To go to the festival!



Into the woods,

Into the woods,

Into the woods,

Then out of the woods

And happy ever after!
