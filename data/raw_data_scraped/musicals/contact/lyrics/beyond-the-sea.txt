Beyond the Sea


Somewhere beyond the sea

somewhere waiting for me

my lover stands on golden sands

and watches the ships

that go sailing in.



Somewhere beyond the sea

she's there watching for me

if I could fly like birds on high

then straight to her arms i'd go sailing in.



It's far beyond the stars

It's near beyond the moon



I know beyond the doubt

my heart will take me there

soon, we'll meet beyond the shore

we'll kiss just as before



Happy we'll be beyond the sea

oh and never again

i'll go sailing in.



{MUSIC BREAK}



I know, beyond the doubt

my heart will take me there soon

we'll meet just beyond the shore

we'll kiss just as before.



Oh! Happy we'll be beyond the sea

and never again

I'll go sailing in!



Together we'll be

Just you and me

beyond the sea
