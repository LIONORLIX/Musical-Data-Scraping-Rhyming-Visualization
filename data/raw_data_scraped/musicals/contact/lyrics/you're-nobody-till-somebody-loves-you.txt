You're Nobody Till Somebody Loves You


ou're Nobody Till Somebody Loves You by Dean Martin

You're nobody 'til somebody loves you

You're nobody 'til somebody cares.

You may be king, you may possess the world and it's gold,

But gold won't bring you happiness when you're growing old.

The world still is the same, you never change it,

As sure as the stars shine above;

You're nobody 'til somebody loves you,

So find yourself somebody to love.



The world still is the same, you never change it,

As sure as the stars shine above;

You're nobody 'til somebody loves you,

So find yourself somebody, find yourself somebody,

Find yourself somebody to love.
