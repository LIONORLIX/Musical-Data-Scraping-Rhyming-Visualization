All Good Gifts


We plow the fields and scatter the good seed on the land..

But it is fed and watered by God's almighty hand..

He sends the snow in winter, the warmth to swell the grain...

The breezes and the sunshine, and soft refreshing rain...



All good gifts around us

Are sent from Heaven above

So thank the Lord, oh thank the Lord for all his love...



We thank thee then, O Father, for all things bright and good,

The seedtime and the harvest, our life, our health, our food,

No gifts have we to offer for all thy love imparts

But that which thou desirest, our humble thankful hearts!



All good gifts around us

Are sent from Heaven above..

So thank the Lord, oh thank the Lord for all his love..



I really wanna thank you Lord!
