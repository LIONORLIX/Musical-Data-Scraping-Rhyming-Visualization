By My Side


Where are you going?

Where are you going?

Can you take me with you?

For my hand is cold

And needs warmth

Where are you going?



Far beyond where the horizon lies

Where the horizon lies

And the land sinks into mellow blueness

Oh please, take me with you



Let me skip the road with you

I can dare myself

I can dare myself

I'll put a pebble in my shoe

And watch me walk (watch me walk)

I can walk and walk!

(I can walk!)



I shall call the pebble Dare

I shall call the pebble Dare

We will talk, we will talk together

We will talk (chorus) about walking

Dare shall be carried

And when we both have had enough

I will take him from my shoe, singing:

"Meet your new road!"

Then I'll take your hand

Finally glad

Finally glad

That you are here

By my side



By my side

By my side

By my side



(Spoken- Judas)

Then the man they called Judas Iscariot

Went to the chief priests, and said

"What will you give me to betray Him to you?"

They paid him thirty pieces of silver.

And from that moment, he began to look out for an opportunity

To betray Him.



By my side

By my side

By my side

By my side
