Learn Your Lessons Well


I can see a swath of sinners settin' yonder

And they're actin' like a pack of fools.

Gazin' into space lettin' their minds wander,

'Stead of studyin' the good Lord's rules.

You better pay attention,

Build your comprehension,

There's gonna be a quiz at your ascension.

Not to mention any threat of hell,

But if you're smart you'll learn your lessons well!



Ev'ry bright description of the promised land meant,

You can reach it if you keep alert.

Learnin' ev'ry line and ev'ry last commandment

May not help you, but it couldn't hurt.

First ya gotta read 'em, then ya gotta heed 'em.

Ya never know when you're gonna need 'em

Just as old Elijah said to Jezebel

"You better start to learn your lessons well!"
