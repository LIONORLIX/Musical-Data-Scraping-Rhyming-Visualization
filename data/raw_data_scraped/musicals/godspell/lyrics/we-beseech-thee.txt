We Beseech Thee


Father, hear thy children's call

Humbly at thy feet we fall

Prodigals confessing all

We beseech thee, hear us!



We thy call have disobeyed

Into paths of sin have strayed

And repentence have delayed

We beseech thee, hear us!



Come sing about Love!

That made us first to be

Come sing about Love!

That made the stone and tree

Come sing about Love!

That draws us lovingly

We beseech thee, hear us!



Sick! We come come to thee for cure

Guilty! We seek thy mercy sure

Evil! We long to be made pure

We beseech thee, hear us!

Blind! We pray that we may see

Bound! We pray to be made free

Stained! We pray for sanctity

We beseech thee, hear us!



Come sing about Love!

That made us first to be

Come sing about Love!

That made the stone and tree

Come sing about Love!

That draws us lovingly

We beseech thee, hear us!



By the gracious saving call

Spoken tenderly to all

Who have shared man's guilt and fall

We beseech thee, hear us!

By the love that longs to bless

Pitying our sore distress

Leading us to holiness

We beseech thee, hear us!



Grant us all from earth to rise

And to strain with eager eyes

Towards the promised Heavenly prize

We beseech thee, hear us!



Come sing about Love!

That made us first to be

Come sing about Love!

That made the stone and tree

Come sing about Love!

That draws us lovingly

We beseech thee, hear us!
