Alas for You


Alas, alas for you,

Lawyers and pharisees

Hypocrites that you be

Searching for souls and fools to forsake them

You travel the land you scour the sea

After you've got your converts you make them

Twice as fit for hell!

As you are yourselves!



Alas, alas, for you

Lawyers and pharisees

Hypocrites that you are

Sure that the kingdom of Heaven awaits you

You will not venture half so far

Other men that might enter the gates you

Keep from passing through!

Drag them down with you!

You snakes, you viper's brood

You cannot escape being Devil's food!

I send you prophets, and I send you preachers

Sages in rages and ages of teachers

Nothing can mar your mood



Alas, alas for you

Lawyers and pharisees

Hypocrites to a man

Sons of the dogs who murdered the prophets

Finishing off what your fathers began

You don't have time to scorn or to scoff

It's getting very late!

Vengeance doesn't wait!

You snakes, you viper's brood

You cannot escape being Devil's food!

I send you prophets, and I send you preachers

Sages in rages and ages of teachers

Nothing can mar your mood



Blind guides, blind fools

The blood you've spilt

On you will fall!

This nation, this generation

Shall bear the guilt of it all!



Alas, alas alas for you!

Blind fools!!
