Prologue / Tower of Babble


Socrates:

Wherefore, O men of Athens,

I say to you:

Therefore, acquit me or not

But whichever you do

I shall never alter my ways

Never adjust my approach to this maze

Never reform til the end of my days

Even if I have to die many times.



Thomas Aquinas:

God is apprehended by imagination, intuition, reason,

touch, opinion, sense, and name - and so on.

While on quite the other hand, we find we can't begin to

Understand him, so to some it seems a shame

To go on

But he is all things in all

And he is nothing in any

He is often found in one thing small

Conversely, he is often missed in many.



Martin Luther:

God almighty has made our rulers mad

God almighty has turned our people bad

For the German nobility, with typical agility,

Have so applied their skill at egregious laws

That the people are lead astray; they feel beholden to obey

I may be just the German way, but God, it gives one pause.





DaVinci:  Gibbon:

The rise of man...

Was natural...



Man is so levitable!





Instead of admiring

Man's filling of the void.

We should rather be surprised

That God had man so tyrannized



... Man will be strong

So long    The decline of Rome...

Was natural...

And inevitable...



Instead of inquiring

Why Rome was destroyed...





We should rather be surprised



That Rome remained so strong



So long



Frederic Nietzsche:



What...

Is noble

Nowadays?



Jean Paul Sartre:



Atheistic existentialism

which I represent is

More coherent - I do believe it...



Buckminster Fuller:



Man is a complex of patterns, of processes...



Jean Paul Sartre:



There is no such thing as human nature,

not in all or few men,

Since there is no God to conceive it...



Buckminster Fuller:



Man is a complex of patterns, of processes...

I live on Earth at present, and I don't know what I am.

I know that I am not a category

I am not a thing - a noun

I seem to be a verb, an evolutionary process-

An integral function of the universe.



All:



So high

In my

Lovely Ivory Tower of Babel

(babble, babble, babble, Babble, babble, babble, babble)

high above the

Rabble

(rabble, rabble, rabble, Babble, Rabble, babble, babble, rabble, babble)

Greatest mind of history

Solving life's sweet mystery

So listen to me (so listen to me)

Know how life should be (know how life should be)

Oh, what does it matter if they don't agree?



[All then sing their parts at the same time, ending with a chorus of:]



Ahhh-ahhh

Ahhh-ahhh

Ahhh-ahhh

Ahhh-ahhh
