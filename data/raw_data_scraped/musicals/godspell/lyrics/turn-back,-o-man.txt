Turn Back, O Man


Turn back, O man

Forswear thy foolish ways

Old now is earth

And none may count her days

Da, da, da, da, da

Yet thou, her child

Whose head is crowned with flames

Still wiltl not hear

Thine inner God proclaim



Turn back, O man (is your seat comfortable sir?) (mm, I like that)

Turn back, O man (is my seat comfortable sir?) (Handle with care)

Turn back, O man (can you take it?)

Forswear thy foolish ways

(See ya later I'm going to the front of the thee-ay-ter)

(Hold me while I slip into something more comfortable)



Earth might be fair

And all men glad and wise

Age after age their tragic empires rise

Da, da, da, da, da.

Built while they dream

And in that dreaming weep

Would man but wake

From out his haunted sleep



Turn back, O man...

Turn back, O man... (hard as a rock)

Turn back, O man...

Forswear thy foolish ways



Earth shall be fair

And all her people one

Not till that hour

Shall God's whole will be done

Now, even now

Once more from earth to sky

Peals forth in joy

Man's old undaunted cry

Earth shall be fair

And all her people one



C'mere Jesus, I got something to show ya!

(chorus repeat first verse)

Forswear thy foolish ways!
