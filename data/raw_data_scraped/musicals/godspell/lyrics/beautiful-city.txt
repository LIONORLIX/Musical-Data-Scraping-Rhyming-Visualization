Beautiful City


Come sing me sweet rejoicing

Come sing me love

We're not afraid of voicing

All the things

We're dreaming of

Oh, high and low,

And everywhere we go



We can build

A beautiful city

Yes we can

Oh yes we can

We can build

A beautiful city

Call it out

And call it the city of man



We don't need alabaster

We don't need chrome

We've got our special plaster

Take my hand (Take my hand)

I'll take you home (I'll take you home!)

We see nations rise

In each other's eyes (in each other's eyes!)



We can build (we can build)

A beautiful city (a beautiful city)

Yes we can

Oh yes we can

We can build (we can build)

A beautiful city (a beautiful city)

Call it out

And call it the city of man



Come sing me sweet rejoicing

Come sing me love

We're not afraid of voicing

All the things (all the things)

We're dreaming of (we're dreaming of)

Oh, high and low,

And everywhere we go (everywhere we go)



We can build (we can build)

A beautiful city (a beautiful city)

Yes we can

Oh yes we can

We can build (we can build)

A beautiful city (a beautiful city)

Call it out

And call it the city of man
