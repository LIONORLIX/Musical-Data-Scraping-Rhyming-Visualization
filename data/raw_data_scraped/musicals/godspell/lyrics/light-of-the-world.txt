Light of the World


You are the light of the world!

You are the light of the world!

But if that light is under a bushel,

It's lost something kind of crucial

You've got to stay bright to be the light of the world



You are the salt of the earth

You are the salt of the earth

But if that salt has lost it's flavor

It ain't got much in its favor

You can't have that fault and be the salt of the earth!



(chorus)

So let your light so shine before men

Let your light so shine

So that they might know some kindness again

We all need help to feel fine (let's have some wine!)



You are the city of God

You are the city of God

But if that city's on a hill

It's kinda hard to hide it well

You've got to stay pretty in the city of God



(chorus)

So let your light so shine before men

Let your light so shine

So that they might know some kindness again

We all need help to feel fine (let's have some wine!)



You are the light of the world

You are the light of the world

But the tallest candlestick

Ain't much good without a wick

You've got to live right to be the light of the world
