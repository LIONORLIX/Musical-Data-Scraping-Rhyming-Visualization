All Falls Down


Hedda

Hey there, mr. Chaplin,

You may think i'm rather small.

'Cause the posh papers are falling at your feet.

So, go ahead and snub me

And don't return my call.

And build your house on top of easy street.



But, what you gonna do when it all falls down

'Cause i let a little rumor spread?

What you gonna do if i change the name

Of the person sleeping in your bed?



What you gonna do when i tell the tale

That makes the country turn its head?

Just a little gossip, and just a little lie.

I'll simply say the little tramp is just a little spy.

And whatâ€™s he gonna do when it all falls down?

Hey there, mr. Chaplin,

Well, your act deserves applause.

You wave our flag and the country is impressed.

But i'm a voice among the crowd

That's questioning your cause,

And now i'll spread my doubt among the rest.

And what'cha gonna do when it all falls down

And where you gonna go from there?

What'cha gonna do when the money's gone

And who you gonna buy to care?

What'cha gonna do when the country says

"now get yourself outta here"?



What'cha gonna paint

When you cannot paint the town?

I'm gonna wipe the smile

From the famous little clown.

And what'cha gonna do when it all falls down?



And all the king's horses

And all the king's men

Will never put poor charlie

Together again!

And what'cha gonna do when it all falls down?
