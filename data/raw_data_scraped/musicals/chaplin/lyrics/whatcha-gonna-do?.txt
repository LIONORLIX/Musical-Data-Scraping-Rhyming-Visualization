Whatcha Gonna Do?


Hannah

You've got a great big house

On top of easy street.

You've got a million quid,

A life that can't be beat.

But you look down on folk,

You're such a mean old bloke . . .



Sorry, i can't seem to remember what comes next.



Young charlie

But there will come a day,

When you're knocked off your feet.

Master of ceremonies



Go on, boy!



Young charlie

Then, what'cha gonna do when it all falls down,

And where you gonna go from there?

What'cha gonna do when the money's gone

And who you gonna buy to care?

What'cha gonna do when the landlord says

"now get yourself outta here"?

What'cha gonna paint

When you cannot paint the town?

Remember what'cha give is what always goes around!

And what'cha gonna do when it all falls down?



Master of ceremonies

Ladies and gentlemen, charlie chaplin!



Charlie, ensemble

What'cha gonna do when it all falls down,

And where you gonna go from there?

What'cha gonna do when the money's gone,

And who you gonna buy to care?

What'cha gonna do when the landlord says

"now get yourself outta here"?

What'cha gonna paint

When you cannot paint the town?

Remember what'cha give is what always goes around!

What'cha gonna do when it all falls...

What'cha gonna do when it all falls down,

And where you gonna go from there?

What'cha gonna do when the money's gone,

And who you gonna buy to care?

What'cha gonna do when the landlord says

"now get yourself outta here"?
