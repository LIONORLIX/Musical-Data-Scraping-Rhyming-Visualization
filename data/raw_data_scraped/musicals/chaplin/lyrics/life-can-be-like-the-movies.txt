Life Can Be Like the Movies


Charlie

Life can be like the movies,

Perfect in every way

Here you can write your story,

Keeping the past at bay

Women

Here it's just happy endings

Men

And the gods only aim to please



Ensemble

Life can be beautiful,

Life can be sweet,

Life can be like the movies.



Charlie

And if you're used to stealing bread on the street,

We have a feast to catch your eye.

The only cops you'll find here walking the beat,

Are just the keystones running by,



Sydney

Look at the life you found here,

Far from old kennington lane.



Ensemble

The weather is always fine here,

'Cause we tell the sky when to rain.



Men

Beautiful faces strolling along,

Women

Keeping the world at ease.

Ensemble

Life can be like the movies,

Here you can do what you please.

Usher

Come see charlie chaplin,

Playing here at the strand.

In essanay's "by the sea"! The funniest comedy of 1916!



Mildred

Romance it never falters,

It lifts you up like a breeze.

Love can be beautiful,

Love can be sweet,

Love can be like . . .

Usher

Come see charlie chaplin,

Playing here at the strand.

In mutual pictures' the rink, the first smash hit of 1918!

Ensemble

Life can be like the movies,

Perfect in every way.

Here you can write your story,

Keeping the past at bay.



Ensemble (contâ€™d)

Here it's just happy endings,

And money just grows on trees.

Life can be beautiful,

Life can be grand,

Life can be bountiful,

At your command,

Life can be like . . .



Charlie

Wait!
