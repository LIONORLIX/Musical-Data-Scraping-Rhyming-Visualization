Alf

He's here, everyone! He's here!



Charlie

Good morning, alf!



Alf

Morninâ€™

The circus. Scene one! Take one!



Charlie

Action!



Ensemble

Just another day in hollywood,

Just another name in lights.



Charlie

Ladies!



Ensemble

Just a new career in hollywood,

Another star to reach the heights.

Once you have tasted the sweetness of fame,

Staying on top is the name of the game.

It's just the way it is in hollywood.



Alf

City lights, scene 83, take 97!



Women

The lights are always glowing,

And the cameras always rolling,

And the director's always shouting "just one more."



Charlie

Just one more!



Ensemble

Starlets always gazing

At the leading man who's playing,

Who is hoping that he's better than before.



Alf

Modern times! Factory scene! Take 28!



Charlie

Conveyor belt - go!



Ensemble

Just another day in hollywood,

You do you're best to stay on top.

Stars on the rise,

Stars on the fall,

Stars you'll forget,

And stars you'll recall,

Lighting up the sky in hollywood.



Hedda

Hello, i'm hedda hopper and this is hedda hopper's hollywood.



Hedda

Just another day in hollywood,



Women

Just another ingenue.

Hedda

Just another day in hollywood,

Women (with men "ahh-ing")

Another midnight rendezvous.

Sweet, young and pretty, with sensuous eyes,

But inside that beauty, scandals arise.

Ensemble

Just another day in hollywood.



Women

If you play the game,

You might get your shot at fame.

And then the leading man

Will always catch your eye.

One night in the hay

And lady luck will come your way.

And then you'll soon be kissing

Waitressing goodbye.



Hedda

He came from afar,

And then he was cast,

'Cause hollywood's a fantasy,

Where you can lose the past.

He became a such star in the city of sin,

Just a hat and cane,

And it's guaranteed you're in.



Charlie

Show me a smile,

Show me some grace,

Charlie

Show me the light,

In that beautiful face.

Hedda

It happens every day in hollywood.

Girls

Charlie, charlie, charlie, charlie, charlie, charlie!



Ensemble

Here you can do

Whatever you please

Whatever you want

You can take it with ease

It's just another day



Hedda

It's just the way we play



Hedda & ensmble

Welcome to the world of hollywood
