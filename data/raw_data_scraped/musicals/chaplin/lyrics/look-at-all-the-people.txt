Look at All the People


Hannah

Come along, charlie, and try to be happy.

Give mum a smile. See, everyone

Along kennington lane,

They got their cares and worries, same as us.



Look at all the people,

And see into their eyes.

Try to find the story

Behind each one's disguise.

Wonder where they've come from,

And the people they have known.

We all have a secret

A face we never have shown



Look at this poor fellow.

See how he is trying

To hold his head up high.

He fights to hide his sorrow

From people passing by.

Maybe there's a lady

Who has sadly broke his heart.

We all wear disguises,

Then we just play the part.

Some have anger,

Some have hope,

Some have courage,

And some just cope.



Hannah

Oh la, look at them two. So uppity. So fake.



Young charlie

Fake?



Hannah

Yes, trying to make everyone think they're rich, from mayfair.



Young charlie

But they're not?



Hannah

Uh-uh. I'm on to them, charlie.

Look at his frayed coat and her worn-out shoes.

They're as poor as we are.

Oh, and look at this sorry bloke. Drunk as a lord.



Young charlie

Just like daddy.



Hannah

Just like daddy. But trying to pretend he's sober.



Young charlie

Just like daddy. Look at me, mum.



Hannah

Thatta boy, charlie! Funny, you're very funny.



Look at all the people,

And then look inside your heart.

There you'll find your story,

Then you can play the part.
