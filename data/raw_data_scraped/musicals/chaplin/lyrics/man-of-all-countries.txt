Man of All Countries


Charlie

I am not a communist, i am a humanist, a man of all countries, who cares deeply

For those whom the world has oppressed and forgotten.



Hedda

Here is a picture from the communist rally

And the man of honor is chaplin.

He spoke for their cause,

Endorsed all their laws,

We can't let this kind of thing happen.

The danger has spread,

The color of red shines wherever he goes.

This man of all countries,

We need to find out who he knows.



Charlie

I need no borders to define what nation i am loyal to. I may travel on a british

Passport, but i am nonetheless a citizen of the world. Patriotism is a love for one's

Country. Nationalism is an obsession that starts wars. And i speak for the children

Of russia, whom no one else in america speaks for.



Hedda

A man of his fame,

A man with his name,

Can't step too far over the line.

The public believes,

What they hear and see,

The effect grows bigger with time.

He can't stay in this land,

And put out his hand,

And then toast to our enemies.

I think it's time that we follow

Everyone he sees.



Mcgranery

Miss hopper, in order for me to launch a full-scale federal investigation into

Chaplin, you're going to have to dig a whole lot deeper!



Hedda / mcgranery

I think it's time that we/you follow

Everyone he sees . . .
