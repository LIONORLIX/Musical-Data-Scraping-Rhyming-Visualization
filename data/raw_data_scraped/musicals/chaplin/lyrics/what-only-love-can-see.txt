What Only Love Can See


Oona

Let me show you the best that's inside you.

Leave the films behind you, just stay and talk to me.

The tramp can charm me with a look that may be funny.

But he can never tell me what only love can see.

Through tomorrow and days of sorrow,

I will follow and always remain.

If you show me the man behind the movie,

You'll start a whole new story

That only love can see.

Through tomorrow and days of sorrow,

Let me follow

And i will remain.



Let them whisper and search for the answer.

But we must remember what only love,

What only love,

What only love can see.
