This Man


Oona

This man, i will always love him

Though the world may question why.

This man, there's been no one like him

A tyrant, but still a child.

Sometimes, there are days i know him.

Then there are days i lose him,

But i'll always love him, this man.



Sydney

This man was my only brother,

A dreamer since just a boy.



Sydney                                                                    Hannah

This life, so full of heartache,                       this little child

But one life gave so much joy                      who cried that night,

This man, so full of wonder,                         this little child,

Yet so full of anger,                                         my child

But gave so much laughter                            became this man.

This man.





Mildred                                                                   Alf

This man once loved me,                                this man

Then i left him                                                   laughed,

All alone.                                                             And the world laughed with him

This man was searching                                   this man

For a love of his own                                        smiled, and the world smiled

With him





Mildred                                                                Alf / Mack Sennett / Mabel

Sometimes, i believed i loved him               this man was a genius.

But could i forgive him?                                 He was the movies

Did i ever know this man?                             Iâ€™ll always laugh at this man.

And the world laughed with him.

And the world smiled with him.

But i left him all alone.

This man was searching

For a love to call his own.
