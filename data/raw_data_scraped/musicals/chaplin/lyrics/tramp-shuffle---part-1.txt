Tramp Shuffle - Part 1


Sennett

Chaplin.

Charlie

Yes sir?

Sennett

That's funny!

Charlie

It is?

Sennett

Yes. Do that walk for me again.

Charlie

This one?

Sennett

What inspired that, boy?

Charlie

You did, sir.

Sennett

Well, i do have that effect on people, don't i?

Charlie

You do, sir, yes.

Sennett

Charlie, when i said i was gonna fire you, i was just trying to scare you.

Charlie

You did.

Sennett

And what would you call this?

Charlie

Character.

Sennett

Ah, yes, you got me there. Character.



Charlie

He's a poet. A dreamer. A wanderer. A tramp!

Sennett

A tramp? I like the sound of that. But what's his, you know?

Charlie

Motivation?

Each day he'll start

A new and unknown journey.

And in his heart

No one will see he's lonely.

He'll search the world

To find a place to call his own.

He'll never have to hide,

Though poor, he'll have his pride,

Whenever the tramp shuffles.



Sennett

And i see chaplin pictures everywhere,

People waiting in the square,

Buying tickets to see.

And you'll be talked about in magazines,

Recognized on movie screens,

Lighting up the marquee.

And the distributors will call my name,

Begging to get in the game.

What a gold mine you'll be,



Sennett (contâ€™d)

Oh, charlie!

With my name above you,

The world's bound to love you,

When they see the tramp shuffle.

Sennett

Action!
