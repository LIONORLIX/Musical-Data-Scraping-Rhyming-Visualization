I took a little trip to Coney Island,

To get away from all the city sprawl,

I couldn't bare to choose which bathing suit to use.

So goodness me I guess I brought 'em all!

But when at last I got to Coney Island,

And found myself a spot upon the sand,

I noticed something strange, there was no place to change



[Girls]

Uh oh!



[Meg]

So I asked my friends to lend a hand. Girls?



[Girls]

Ahhhh, ooooooh,

Bathing Beauty take a look at you!

Bathing Beauty on the beach,

Bathing Beauty say hello!

What a cutie?! What a peach?! Bathing Beauty watch her go,

Hosing under her parasol she is what you call a real spectacle,

Prim and proper with class and poise

She's got the boys apoplectical.

Bathing beauty on the beach see her practically glow

Wearing a smile and givin' Coney Island

A bathing beaut of the show!
