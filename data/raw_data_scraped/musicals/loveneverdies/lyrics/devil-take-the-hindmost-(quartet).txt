Devil Take The Hindmost (Quartet)


Raoul:

Will she sing?

Will she flee?

What is she

thinking now?



Is it him?

Is it me?

Devil take the hindmost.



Stagehand 1: (spoken) Ready on the floor?

Stagehand 2: (spoken) Ready on the floor!



(Overlapping)

Raoul:

Will she stay?

Will she go?

Does she know

Even know?

Please Christine

Stop the show



Phantom:

Obey your heart

And sing for me

You want it so

Stay and be mine

Eternally



Both:

Devil take the hindmost.



Now it's time

To make your choice

Do it for our son



Phantom: Use your head



Raoul: No time to wait



Both:

Hesitate

We're all undone



Stagehand 1: (spoken) Ready in the pit?

Stagehand 2: (spoken) Ready in the pit!



(Overlapping)



Madame Giry:

Perhaps she won't go on

Perhaps she'll lose her nerve

Perhaps her voice won't serve

And she will fail him now

And then my child and I

Will get what we deserve



Raoul:

Will she stay?

Will she go?

Does she know

Even know?

Please Christine

Stop the show



Phantom:

Obey your heart

And sing for me

And sing for me

Give me the child

Eternally



All:

Devil take the hindmost.



(Repeat)



All:

Now it's time

No turning back

All is on the line.



Here it is

The final dance

One last chance to get what's mine.



Madame Giry:(spoken)

I hope Christine is worthy of you. I hope her singing makes up for what your blindness has done to Meg and me.



Meg: Devil take the hindmost.
