Devil Take The Hindmost


Raoul:

Miss Giry! I'm not afraid of him! I've bested him before! And if he ever had the courage to meet me face to face, man to

man! No...no, it can't be!



Phantom:

Not afraid of me, you say?



Raoul:

Stay back, or I'll kill you I promise you!



Phantom:

Of course, as you say you've beaten me before. But that was a long time ago, Vicomte, and we were playing a different game.

Look at you,

Deep in debt, stinking drunk, pitiful

Shall we two make a bet

Devil take the hindmost



Raoul:

Look at you,

Foul as sin, hideous, horrible

Call the stakes, deal me in

Devil take the hindmost



Phantom:

Our Christine shall choose tonight



Raoul: Let her choose



Phantom:

Is she yours or mine?



Raoul:

Draw the line



Phantom:

If she sings, you lose tonight



Raoul:

I won't lose



Phantom:

You leave from here



Raoul:

Fine!



Phantom:

Disappear



Raoul:

Fine!

And if she won't, if I win?



Phantom:

All your debts, wiped away



Raoul:

Very well, let's begin



The Phantom and Raoul: Devil take the hindmost



Raoul: You think you have the odds

You think you're in control

You think you've fixed the dice

Well I will gladly roll

I'll bet against the house

I'll even double down



Phantom:

Our whole game, it's been changed

Every throw, riskier

All the rules, rearranged

Fate has re-designed most



Raoul:

Fortune's on my side

I won her long ago!

I won her from you then

I'll wager even now

I'll win her back again

And when the game is done



Phantom:

Cut the deck, let us play

Roll the die, once again

In the end

Either way!



Phantom and Raoul:

Devil take the hindmost!

Now Christine shall choose at last

Is she yours or mine?



Raoul:

We've a son, a bond secure



Phantom:

Are you sure?



Raoul: What?



Phantom:

Are you so sure?



Raoul:

What do you mean?



Phantom:

Such a child, strange to see

Different, musical



Raoul: Huh?



Phantom:

Is he more you or me?

Which one do you find most?



Raoul:

You lie!

I call your bluff, the game is on

And we will see, who wins out

Once and for all



Phantom:

Deal the cards, let them fall

Choose your hand, try your best

He who wins



Phantom and Raoul:

Wins it all!

Devil take the hindmost



Raoul:

I call your bluff, the game is on

And we will see, who wins out

Once and for all



Phantom:

Deal the cards, let them fall

Choose your hand, try your best

He who wins



Phantom and Raoul:

Wins it all!

Devil take the hindmost!



Phantom:

She walks, you leave together.

Pockets full, debts paid.

She sings, you leave alone.



Phantom:

Devil take the hindmost.

Raoul:

My god, what have I done? Look at me, the concert's only hours away...
