Ah, Christine!


Phantom:

Ah, Christine, my Christine,

What a triumph you gave me tonight

My Christine, all the dark silent years now set right, ah Christine



Christine:

The song was beautiful, it sounded beautiful

Every note, every word

And it felt beautiful, and I felt beautiful



The Phantom and Christine:

Lost in the music once more

Feeling it rise up and soar

Alive once again!



Christine: My dearest wife...



Raoul: Little Lotte, I beg you, forgive me



Christine: Raoul, no!



Raoul: Little Lotte, ah, what fools we once were



Christine and Raoul: Long ago in our youth



Christine:

In Paris, at the opera



Raoul:

Romantic idiot...



Christine:

Those two people are gone



Raoul and Christine:

Now I must go, our choices are made

The opera is done; the last notes have been played



Raoul:

May your angel of music watch over you now

And give you what I wish I gave you somehow

Yours, in regret



Christine:

Raoul.
