Chorus Girl 1: You're already a hit!

Chorus Girl 2: Honey, please, he's here.



Chorus Girl 1: And in just two days, he'll be there tossing you bouquets

at our gala premiere.



Chorus Girl 2: Picture it!



Chorus Girl 1: The cream of Manhattan!



Chorus Girl 2: Celebrities! Millionaires!



Chorus Girl 1: Watching you!



Meg: I'll be waiting in the wing,

wound up tighter than a spring

as the house begins to dim.

And I'll practice every line

hoping desperately to shine,

shining only for him.



Meg and Chorus Girls:

Just imagine how they'll cheer

at the moment you appear.



Meg: Stepping out before the scrim

let 'em woop and let 'em call

I won't hear the crowd at all



Chorus Girls: No it's only for him.



Meg: Tell me how I look.



Chorus Girl 1: Fine.



Meg: Just fine? What about my hair?



Chorus Girl 2: Beautiful!



Meg: You swear?



Chorus Girl 1: Trust me, when the boss sees how you put that song across



Chorus Girl 2: Hell! He 'aint got a prayer!



Meg: Oh you mean it?



Chorus Girls:

You'll step out into the light

Looking lovely,

Burning bright.

All vitality and veer.



Meg: Aha. And I'll rapturously float through the melody he wrote.

singing only for him.



Meg and Chorus Girls:

And before the music dies,

Up the audience will rise,

Nearly bursting at the brim.



Chorus Girls: And you'll stand there in the glow.



Meg: And, perhaps, at last he'll know.



Chorus Girl 1: Girls! Hurry up, we're on!



Man 1: Where is she?



Man 2: Look!



Man 1: Just like in the posters!



Man 3: There!



Man 2: The Ooh-La-La Girl!



Onlookers: Meg Giry!



Meg: Welcome, each and every one,

to our imperilment of fun!



Chorus: And buffet of Bali Hoo!

It's where Coney comes to play,

And it's opening today.



Meg: And it's only for you!



Chorus: And you!

And you!

And you!

Entertainment day and night,

Sure to dazzle and delight!



Meg: And, of course, we'll be there too!



Chorus: We're so happy that you're here,

for this seasons big premier.

And it's only for you!
