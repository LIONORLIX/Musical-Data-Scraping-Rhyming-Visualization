Before The Performance


Christine:

(spoken) Gustave, could you hand me those earrings? The diamond ones on the left. There how do i look?



Gustave:

You look so beautiful

So very beautiful

Like a queen in a book



Christine:

You too are beautiful

So very beautiful.

Once this performance is through,

We'll spend some time

Just us two.

Won't that be fun?



Gustave (spoken):

Father! Doesn't Mother look lovely tonight?



Raoul (spoken):

Indeed she does. As lovely as she looked the very first time I came to her dressing room door.



Christine (spoken):

And look at you Raoul! You look just like that handsome boy in the opera box. The one who would always toss me a single red

rose.



Raoul:

Please Gustave, if you don't mind. Would you wait outside a while?



Gustave (spoken):

May I go exploring? By myself?



Christine:

Yes but stay back stage my dear.

When I'm finished meet me here.



Gustave (spoken):

I will.



Raoul:

Since our wedding day

Things have gone astray



Christine (spoken):

Raoul-



Raoul:

I'm not proud of the way that I have acted



Christine (spoken):

We've both been-



Raoul:

The demands I've made

All the hopes mislaid

I'm aware of the price they've exacted.



Though I have no right to ask you to,

There's one thing more I'd have you do

If you love me as I love you



Christine (spoken):

Anything darling



Raoul:

Don't sing the song dear



Christine (spoken):

What? But Raoul-



Raoul:

You have to know something's terribly wrong dear



Christine:

But I have to do this. It's what we agreed to.



Raoul:

That hell spawn demon. He's had us playing his game all along dear



Christine:

Let me just get through this. Listen, please. I need to.



Raoul:

You need so much it's true

And I've denied you

You need the man you knew,

Back here beside you

You'll have him back I vow

Just ask it of me.

But we must leave here now

If you still love me.



Christine (spoken):

Do you mean it Raoul? Truly?



Raoul (spoken):

I've booked a passage for three on the Atlantic Queen. It leaves in an hour, we'll have just enough time. I beg you. Lets be

on it. For both our sakes and the child's.

(sung)

Leave this place behind.



Phantom:

He knows his love is not enough

He knows he isn't what you need

He knows you're made of finer stuff

I think on that, we're all agreed.



It's time to leave him in the dust

It's time to be who you should be

It's time to do now as you must

And set the music in you free.



In moments, mere moments,

Drums will roll.

There'll you stand

Just like before.



The crowd will hush

And then in one sweet rush

I will hear you sing once more.

And music, our music

Will swell and then unwind

Like two strands of melody

At last entwined.



Fulfill us, complete us

Make us full

Seal our bond forever more

Tonight, for me,

Embrace your destiny.

Let me hear you sing

Once more.



(spoken)

StageHand:

Miss Daae its time



Christine:

Twisted in every way

What answer can I give?



I know I can't refuse

And yet I wish I could

Oh god



Raoul(offstage):

Christine, Christine

Don't think that I dont care

But every hope and every prayer

Rests on you now.
