Mother, did you watch?


Meg:

Mother did you watch

Everything is sold

Mother can't you tell

The new routine, it went so well



I was worried just a touch

That it might have been too much

Just a bit, well, rather free



But just listen to the crowd

Why they've never been so loud

Screaming only for me.



Madame Giry: Meg-



Meg:

And the Master must have heard

Every note and every word

Mother, tell me, did he see?



Madame Giry: Meg, stop it-



Meg:

Even he will now concede

I'm the only one he'll need.

Mother what's wrong?



Madame:

Meg, sweet fool, you did all that you could

Charming, bright and yet still not enough



Meg: What? What do you mean?



Madame Giry:

How you danced

They're all entranced

Yes

All but the one whose entrancement we sought



Meg: He wasn't there?



Madame Giry:

Where poor girl, do you think that he was?

Yes, that's right, in with her all along



Meg: With Christine?



Madame Giry:

Dreaming of their child, they're love

Too smitten to give you one moment of thought-



Meg: But you said-



Madame Giry:

All that you gave him, it's all been a waste-



Meg: You're wrong!



Madame Giry:

All that you've done it has all been erased



Meg: Don't say that!



Madame Giry:

Now he has them,

As for us,

We have both been replaced



Meg: No!
