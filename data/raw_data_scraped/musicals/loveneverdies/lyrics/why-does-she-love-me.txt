Why Does She Love Me


Raoul (spoken):

One more.



Barman (spoken):

Ah Buddy, don't you think you've had enough? It's practically morning already.



Raoul (spoken):

One more I said!



Barman (spoken):

Alright, alright.

My shift is over anyway, so let's settle the bill okay?. Jeez you're in a bad way ain't you? The worst of the most end up

here. Here's the morning shift. Maybe he'll know what to do with you.



Raoul (spoken):

Yes what to do with me.

That's the question isn't it? That's always been the question. Ever since the beginning.



Raoul(sung):

She looks for sympathy

I give her sorrow

She asks for honesty

I've none to borrow

She needs my tender kiss

She begs it of me

I give her ugliness

Why does she love me?



She yearns for higher things

Things I can't give her

The rush the music brings

I can't deliver

And even when she sings

And soars above me

I try to clip her wings

Why does she love me?



One more drink sir

That's what I need don't you think sir?

Leave the hurt behind.



(spoken) Didn't you hear me?

Another drink!



(sung) She wants the man I was

Husband and father

At least she thinks she does

She needn't bother.



Beneath this mask I wear

There's nothing of me

Just horror, shame, dispair

Why does she love me?



How about you sir?

Tell me what am I to do sir

Leave the hurt behind.



Meg:

Morning Bernie

Coffee please

Hurry up before I freeze

I'll just take it black



(spoken)

Meg:

Mother said I'd find you here.



Raoul:

Miss Giry.



Meg:

Do you know where you are?



Raoul:

Hell, I imagine.



Meg:

Around here, they call it Suicide Hall. Its where people end up when they don't know where else to go. The hopeless, the

desperate. It's a good place to step off the side of a pier and quietly vanish.



Raoul:

You seem to be a regular?



Meg:

Me? I come here to swim.



(sung) This town is coarse and cold and mean

It's hard to keep your conscience clean.

Faceless in the crowd

Anythings allowed.

And so I come at dawn each day

Come to wash it all away

Sink into the sea

Blue and cool and kind

Let it set me free

Let the past unwind

Leave the hurt behind



(spoken)

Meg:

You should never of come to America.

It's not a place for people like you and Christine. It's too easy to forget who you are and where you belong. That's why

mother says you must leave here. Now. Take your wife and the boy and go.



Raoul:

Leave? But what about tonight? The concert, the money. Am I to just run away? From him?



Meg:

When the sun rises tomorrow we can all start again. Clean.



(sung) Sail across the sea

Put us out of mind

Close your eyes and flee

Let yourself stay blind

Leave this place behind
