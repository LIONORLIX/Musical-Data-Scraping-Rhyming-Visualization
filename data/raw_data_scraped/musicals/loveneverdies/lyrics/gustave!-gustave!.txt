Gustave! Gustave!


Christine: Gustave...



The Phantom: What is it?



Christine: Gustave



The Phantom: What's wrong?



Christine: Gustave!



The Phantom: What's wrong?!



Christine: He should be here, he was meant to be here!



The Phantom: It's that idiot Raoul,

Why I'll kill that drunken fool!

That he dare take this child

A child that isn't his

Mr. Squelch!



Squelch: Sir?



The Phantom: Seal the port, blockade each road

Call in every favour that I'm owed

I'll be damned if he leaves this isle!



Squelch: The Vicomte de Chagney left here in a carriage

Saw with my own eyes, sir

There was no one with him



The Phantom: Are you quite certain he left here alone?



Squelch: Sir, was there anyone else here backstage?



The Phantom: Yes. Yes...

Madame Giry, she was here, with her vicious little sneer

And that comment she made

The ungrateful back-biting snake!

She's been greedy, yes indeed,

She'll get hers now guaranteed!

Go now, quickly, bring her round

Bring the boy safe and sound

Then I'll tear her limb from limb!



Madame Giry: What is the meaning of this? How dare your minions manhandle me in this fashion? I demand an answer.



The Phantom: The boy woman! What have you done with him?



Madame Giry: The boy, you think I took the boy? Why would I do such a thing? Do you think I don't know who he is?

All these years,

Who has been more faithful more than I? No one!



The Phantom: Giry!



Madame Giry: All these years,

How can you think I'd hurt that child?



The Phantom: My patience is running dry!



Madame Giry: All these years,

I've been mother to you and Christine as much as my daughter



The Phantom: Enough!



Madame Giry: Do you think I don't know it hurts to see one's own child brought to harm?



The Phantom: Gustave! Gustave! Gustave!



Fleck: Sir

I just passed Meg's dressing room

It was empty as a tomb

But her mirror was smashed all in pieces on the floor



The Phantom: Meg!



Madame Giry: My god...



Fleck: And I saw her down the hall

Pulling someone pale and small

And she looked all about

And the scurried out the door



Madame Giry: God, I left her so distraught

Please, who knows just what she thought

I'm afraid she's come undone

But she won't hurt him

Meg would never hurt him

How could she hurt him?



The Phantom: I know where they've gone. But we must hurry!



Madame Giry: In that crowd? There are millions of people out there!



Christine: Gustave...my poor Gustave...



The Phantom: There's no time to waste!



Christine: Gustave!

Gustave! Gustave!



The Phantom: You there! Stop!



Christine: That's not him!



Madame Giry: Meg!



The Phantom: I think I see them; this way!



Christine: Gustave is that -- I'm so sorry!



Madame Giry: Meg, please! It's okay!



The Phantom: To the pier, now! Hurry!
