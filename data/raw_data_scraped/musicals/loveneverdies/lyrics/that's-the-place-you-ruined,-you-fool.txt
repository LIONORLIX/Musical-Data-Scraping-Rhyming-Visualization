That's the place you ruined, you fool


Fleck: Thats the place that you ruined you fool!



Madame Giry: (Speaking) What do you mean?



Fleck: Thatâ€™s the world you destroyed with your greed!



Madame Giry: (Speaking) It wasn't my fault! I couldn't have known!



Fleck: Don't you remember what happened back then? When we even we dared to walk among men!

When even a phantom could dream his dark dreams once again...
