Arrival of the Trio / Are You Ready to Begin


Squelch:

Are you ready to begin?

Are you ready to get on?

You're about to start out on the journey of your life.



Dialogue.



Gangle:

If you're ready then get in

Once you're in then we'll get gone

And who knows once it goes,

where you'll be when it arrives.



Dialogue.



Fleck:

It's a funhouse where the mirrors all reflect what's real.



Fleck/Gangle:

And reality's as twisted as the mirrors reveal

And the fun is finding out what the mirrors show



Raoul: This is unacceptable do you hear me! I will be taking this up with your employer, whoever he is.



Gustave:

Everything and everyone, it's all just how I dreamed

All the freaks and all the fun, exactly how I dreamed

And Phantasma still awaits

Wonder what's behind its gates.
