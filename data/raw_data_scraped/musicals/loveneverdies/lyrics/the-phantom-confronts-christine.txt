The Phantom Confronts Christine


Christine: Gustave! It's alright, it's me! Gustave. Please, take him away.

I'm so sorry, please forgive him. He meant no harm.



The Phantom: How could you think I wouldn't guess?



Christine: What do you mean?



The Phantom: How could you think I wouldn't know?



Christine: Oh no...



The Phantom: Do you have something to confess?



Christine: Please don't make me!



The Phantom: I want the truth right now if so!



Christine: Once upon another time, you went off and left me alone

But that's not all you did. You left me with a son.

Ever since that other time, I wish how I wish you'd have known

I kept the secret hid, the secret my marriage forbid

What else could I have done?

Just love



The Phantom: A son...



Christine: Just live



The Phantom: My son...



Christine: Just give what I can give, and take what little I deserve



The Phantom: My own flesh and blood and even he recoils in horror from me. Just like his mother.



Christine: Forgive me, I beg you, if you can

I've brought you nothing but woe

Tomorrow night, I'll sing with all my heart

Sing for you again!

Then we'll go.



The Phantom: From out of ugliness, such light

From out of darkness, such a flame

In him my wrongness is made right

And yet he loathes me all the same



So let him shun me in disgust

Let him flee this cursed face

If I must hide from him I must

Yet shall he be my saving grace



For Christine, my Christine

If it's true I've no reason to live

Then Christine, then a boy shall have all I can give

Ah Christine

All I create on this earth

All that I'll never be worth

All shall be his!



Madame Giry: Ten long years and he casts us aside

Ten whole years, this is how we're repaid

Ten dark years of toil and tears

And now what we've worked for will go to that child!



All our hopes were at last in our grasp

All the dreams and the plans that we laid

Everything is vanishing

And we get discarded, rejected, reviled



All of the bonds in between is now torn

All of the love that we gave him forsworn

All would be ours if that bastard had never been born!
