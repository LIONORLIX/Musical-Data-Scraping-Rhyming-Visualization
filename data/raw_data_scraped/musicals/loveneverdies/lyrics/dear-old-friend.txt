Dear Old Friend


Meg: 5, 6, a-5, 6, 7, 8

Meg and Girls: Bathing beauty, on the beach Bathing beauty, say hello What a cutie, what a peach Bathing beauty, watch her go.

Man: (Speaking)Alright, Meg, take 5, girls, take it one more time

Girls: Bathing beauty, on the beach

Madame Giry:(Speaking)Very nice, Meg

Meg: Do you think so, mother, really?

Madame Giry: You've come a long way since the beginning of the season

Meg: Does he agree? It's been three months, he never comes to see the show. Even a word from him, just one.

Madame Giry: You may get more than that. He has been composing again, late at night. Not this cheap Vaudeville trash, something

glorious.

Meg: For, for me?

Madame Giry: Continue to work hard. Make yourself useful to him.

Gustave: Mother

Christine: Patience, Gustave. First I must find the stage manager, my dressing room, the musical director.

Gustave: Then we'll go look for our friend and go see the island?

Christine: I'm sure he'll send for you when he's ready. Well, excuse me, miss, would you mind?

Meg: (Singing) Heaven help me, could it be? No, it couldn't possibly

Christine: Sorry, do I?

Meg: Yes, I think you do

Christine: Have we?

Meg: Go on, take a guess

Christine: Wait, it can't be, is it?

Meg: Yes

Christine: Oh, my God, I can't believe it's you

Meg: Look at you, Christine. Regal as a queen and beautiful

Christine: Meg, and you as well I could hardly tell it's you

Both: My dear old friend Can't believe you're here, old friend

Christine: After all this time

Meg: So glad you came

Christine: You look sublime

Meg: You look the same

Both: My sweet old friend. Never thought we'd meet, old friend

Christine: Look at you, a star

Meg: And you, a wife

Both: And isn't life a splendid thing?

Christine: And here we are

Meg: To see the sights

Christine: And sing

Meg: To sing?

Christine: And of course, as a treat for my son Meg, meet Gustave

Meg: Who hired you to sing here?

Raoul: You!

Madame Giry: It can't be you!

Raoul: Is this a jest?

Madame Giry: How can this be?

Raoul: We've come to work

Madame Giry: At whose request?

Raoul: The contract's here

Madame Giry: I want to see. My God, the price

Raoul: It's rather high

Madame Giry Why, it's absurd

Raoul: Oh, yes, I know. Inform your boss that, by the by, the fee goes up or else we go

Both: My dear old friend. Here's how things appear, old friend

Madame Giry: He who pays the bill

Raoul: Times two or three

Madame Giry: Be sure he will

Raoul: And handsomely

Both: And dear old friend. Now that we are clear, old friend

Madame Giry: That's all very well but till you're gone, you'll wait upon my boss' whim

Raoul: Ah, yes, your boss and who is that?

Madame Giry: It's him

Meg: Sorry, did I hear you right? Here to sing

Christine: Tomorrow night

Meg: I'm afraid there must be some mistake. You can't be performing

Christine: Why?

Meg: Mainly, dear 'cause so am I! I'm in fact the star, for heaven's sake! What are you to sing?

Christine: Just one little thing, an aria. Please you needn't fret I'm sure you will get your due

Raoul: Him?

Madame Giry: That's what I said

Raoul: You work for him?

Madame Giry: Now so do you

Raoul: And my poor wife. We thought him dead. She'll be appalled!

Madame Giry: Unless she knew

Christine: Darling, please, are you alright?

Raoul: Tell me now, that music, who was its creator?

Christine: Darling, please don't squeeze so tight

Raoul: Something's going on here, I'll deal with you later

Meg: Did you know?

Madame Giry: How could I know? Why would they come?

Meg: Why won't they go?

All: My dear old friend. Can't believe you're here, old friend

Madame Giry: Speaking as your host

Meg: As an artist

Christine: What a surprise

Raoul: To say the least

All: Yes, dear old friend. That's a happy tear, old friend. I can't conceal, try though I may, the way I feel, so I pretend, I'm

sure it's clear, to such a dear old friend

Madame Giry: You mustn't stay!

Christine: Why would I leave?

Raoul: Why are we here?

Meg: Don't play naive

All: What dear old friends. Don't we all live here, old friends?

Raoul: Nothing has been changed

Meg: And never will

Madame Giry and Christine: Just rearranged

All: And yet we're still, such grand old friends, such devoted and old friends. Words cannot suggest what's in my heart and for the

rest why even start?

All:My dear old friends! So much longer near, old friends. Back again at last. When everyone Is doing great. Won't this be fun?

With dear old friends. Utterly sincere old friends!

Meg: Honey, break a leg

Raoul: Madame, good day

Madame Giry: Enjoy your stay

Christine: Hope it extends

All: So glad you're here! A lovely dear old friend! Old friend!
