Gustave: Who are you?

Where are you taking me?



Fleck: I am Miss Fleck.



Squelch: The Mighty Squelch.



Gangle: Dr. Gangle.



Trio: At your service.



Fleck: And his.



Gangle: Come along and follow us.



Fleck: Come and follow faster.



Squelch: Come along and follow us.



Trio: Come and meet the master.

Hurry up

And follow us

Hurry if you care to

Soon the dark

Will swallow us

Follow if you dare to



Gustave: Is this is where Mr. Y lives?



Gangle: This is where he works.



Fleck: Step lively child.



Squelch: He is waiting.



Gustave: What is this place?



Phantom: This is my realm

Illusion's domain

Where music and beauty

And art have faced rain

Go, look around while I finish my work.



Gustave: May I?



Phantom: What's this?



Gustave: Just a song

In my head



Phantom: Go on.



Gustave: I think it's beautiful.

Beautiful, beautiful notes.

Beautiful, beautiful sounds.

Don't you agree?

It's beautiful



Phantom: This boy.



Gustave: So very beautiful.



Phantom: This music.



Gustave: Music that calms and controls.



Phantom: He plays like me.



Gustave: Haunting, and lovely, and bold



Phantom: He just ten years old.

Ten years old.

My God

My God
