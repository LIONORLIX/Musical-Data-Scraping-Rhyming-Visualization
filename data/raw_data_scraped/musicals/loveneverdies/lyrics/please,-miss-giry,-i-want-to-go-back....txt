Please, Miss Giry, I want to go back...


Please, Miss Giry

I want to go back

I want my mother



The world is hard

The world is mean

It's hard to keep

Your conscience clean



Please, you're hurting me



The sea is calm

The sea is gray

It washes

Everything away



I can't swim

Don't worry, it's almost over



Sink into the deep

Blue and cool and kind

Then drift off to sleep

Let the past unwind

Leave the hurt behind



Gustave

Mother

No, I'm not done yet



Let go of the boy now

Not another step

Let go of him, girl, or I promise you

Not another word



Always wondered

How to make you watch

Well, watch me now



I took a little trip to Coney Island

I took a little trip because of you

I did as Mother said and followed where you led

And tried to do what little I could do



Well, here's the way it works on Coney Island

They make you pay for every little crumb

I gave what they would take, I gave it for your sake

Now look at me and see what I've become



Bathing beauty on the beach

Bathing beauty in her dressing room

Bathing beauty in the dark

On their laps, in their arms, in their beds



Meg, my little Meg

What are you saying?



Who helped you raise the money?

Who helped the permits come through?

Who greased the wheels of your high flying deals

Bought you time when the bills came due?



Who swayed the local bosses

Curried favor with the press?

No, not her

And who kept singing, desperate for your favor

Who kept dancing, hoping you would save her

Who kept dying and this is what you gave her



Now that I've got your attention at last

Here's the big finish and then you can go



Give me the gun, Meg

Give me the hurt and the pain and the gun, Meg

Give me the blame for not seeing the things

That you've done, Meg



Give me the gun, Meg

Give me the chance to see you clear at last

See me clear at last

You feel ugly, you feel used

You feel broken, you feel bruised



Ah, but me, I can see all the beauty underneath

Yes

You've been robbed of love and pride

Been ignored and pushed aside

Even so, I still know there is beauty underneath

Yes



Diamonds never sparkle right

If they aren't set just right

Beauty sometimes goes unseen

We can't all be like Christine



Christine, Christine

Always Christine



No, I didn't mean to

Mother, there, say something

Say anything

Giry, go get help, now



Where's Papa?

He should be here

Where's Papa?

Your father, your real father



Look with your heart and not with your eyes

The heart understands, the heart never lies

Believe what it feels and trust what it shows

Look with your heart, the heart always knows



Love is not always beautiful

Not at the start

So open your arms

And close your eyes tight

Look with your heart

And when you find love



No



Once upon another time, our story had only begun

I had a taste of joy, the most I ever knew

Now there isn't any time and somehow our story is done

And what about the boy, what am I to do?



Just love, just live

And give what we can give

And take the love that you deserve

Just love, just live

And give all that I have

And take what little I deserve



Come closer, I beg you

Closer still

Remember love never dies

Kiss me one last time
