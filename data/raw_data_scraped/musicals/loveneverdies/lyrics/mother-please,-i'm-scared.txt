Mother Please, I'm scared


Gustave

Mother, please, I'm scared!

What a dream! An awful dream!

Someone strange and mad,

Seizing me and drowning me!



Christine

Shh, Gustave.

It's all right.

Come and meet a friend of mine.



Phantom

Welcome to my world, my friend.



Christine

Gustave, this is Mister Y.



Gustave

This place is yours?



Phantom

Every inch of it.

Tell me where you'd like to go.

Tell me what you want to see

I can grant any wish...



Gustave

Could you show me,

If you please,

All the islands mysteries?

All that's strange and wild and dark

In the shadows of the park?



Phantom

You shall see it all tomorrow.

I promise.



Christine

Back to sleep now, Gustave.



Gustave

Yes, mother.
