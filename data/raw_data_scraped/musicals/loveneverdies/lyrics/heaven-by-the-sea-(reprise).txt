Heaven By The Sea (Reprise)


All: It's the last day of the season

And there ain't a single cloud

What a day to leave the city on a spree

Away from all the hustle and the bustle and the crowd

On a little slice of heaven by the sea



It's the last day of the season to indulge

(Forget the factory and the scrum)

To be rested and relaxed and fancy free

(One day more then back to work)

To flee from all the bother and the hassle and the noise



Man: With your lady



Woman: And your fella



Couple: And your kids and your umbrella



All: On a little slice of heaven by the sea

The surf, the sand, the breeze, the food,

The peace and calm, the restful mood,

Amid the sea and spray

The city falls away

The sun (the sun), the sea (the sea), the salty air,

The miles (the miles) of beach (of beach) with room to spare,



Man: And the pretzels



Woman: And the custard



Man 1: And the girls!

Man 2: The francs!

Man 3: The mustard!

Woman 1: And the tanning!

Woman 2: And the lotion!

Woman 3: And the pier,

Man 1: The beer,

Man 2: The ocean,



Woman: And the oysters,



Man: And the pickles,



Man 2: And the knockers,



Man 3: And the steamers,



All: It's a little slice of heaven by the sea



What a treat to get away

From the frantic and the fray

All the cluster and the fuss



To this placid little beach

Far beyond the city's reach

And it's only for us



What a joy to convalesce

From the city's wild excess

And forget it all like thus



On this sheltered little slice

Of a seaside paradise...



It's the last day of the season

So relax and have a beer

Hurry up, the summer's almost over...
