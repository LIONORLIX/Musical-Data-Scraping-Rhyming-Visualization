Hey, Mrs. Aster, over here

Hey, how was the trip?

Is that the latest Paris style?

There's nothing there we don't have

Bigger and better over here, I assure you

Thanks, Colonel

Hey, there she is

Miss Daae, Miss Daae

Christine, Miss Daae



Raoul: Her name is Madame de Chagny, now stand aside, stand aside please! No pictures, do you hear? No pictures of my wife,

no pictures of the boy!



Press: Hey Christine! Why Coney Island? Your first concert in years, why aren't you singing at the Met?



Raoul: The Vicomtess has been engaged by a well-known person --



Press: Well-known? No one's ever seen the guy! Hey, how do you lure the great Christine Daae over here anyways? It's the

money right? All that American moola? Hey Christine, what'cha gonna sing, Yankee-doodle moola?



Raoul: My wife is an artist, sir!



Press: Yeah, and her art is paying off your gambling debt, that's what they say in France! Is it true you left your entire

fortune on a roulette table in Montecarlo?



Raoul: Insolent reject! How dare you!



Gustave: Father?



Raoul: Not now, Gustave.



Press: Hey kid! How's it feel to have a famous mother? This your first time in America? What do you plan to do here at Coney?



Gustave: I-I want to learn how to swim



Raoul: I said leave the child alone. God's sake! Didn't this Mr. Y send someone to receive us?



Gustave: Mother, look! Right over there, across the square. What is it?
