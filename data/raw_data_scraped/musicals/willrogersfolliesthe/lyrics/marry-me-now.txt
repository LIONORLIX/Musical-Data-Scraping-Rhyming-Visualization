Marry Me Now


-WILL-

We’re heading for a wedding (we’re heading for a wedding)

That’s wedding number two (that’s wedding number two)

I loved it the first time, how could this be a worse time’

As long as it’s with you.



Marry me now

Marry me then

I don’t care how

Or where why or when

Anytime you ask me I’ll rush to the altar (ask me I’ll rush to the altar)

Won’t even falter (won’t even falter)

The thousandth time (the thousandth time)



Ask me this fall

Ask the next spring

Can’t get enough

Of such a good thing

Make my life a honeymoon heaven for two

All my days and my nights (his days and his nights)

Like Turkish delights

Marry, marryin’ you



-BETTY-

I got you, for the second time.

I got you, it’s our second splice.

I got you, double ecstasy.

I got you, twice is twice as nice!

Down to the altar I’ll sidle

I feel twice as bridal

No shy violet, let’s middle aisle it



I got you, and I’m twice as glad.

I got you, like I did before.

I got you, once is not enough.

I got you, so I’m back for more!

We’ll have a honeymoon heaven

‘Till a hundred and seven!

I’m gonna be true!

I’d be lost without you!



-BOTH-

We’re heading for a wedding

That happened years ago

We’ve tasted wedded bliss now,

But let’s just steal a kiss now

As if we didn’t know!



-WILL (at same time as Betty, below)-

Marry me now

Marry me then

I don’t care how

Or where why or when

Anytime you ask me I’ll rush to the altar

Won’t even falter

The thousandth time



Ask me this fall

Ask the next spring

Can’t get enough

Of such a good thing

Make my life a honeymoon heaven for two

All my days and my nights

Like Turkish delights

Marry, marryin’ you



-BETTY (at same time as Will, above)-

I got you, for the second time.

I got you, it’s our second splice.

I got you, double ecstasy.

I got you, twice is twice as nice!

Down to the altar I’ll sidle

I feel twice as bridal

No shy violet, let’s middle aisle it



I got you, and I’m twice as glad.

I got you, like I did before.

I got you, once is not enough.

I got you, so I’m back for more!

We’ll have a honeymoon heaven

‘Till a hundred and seven!

I’m gonna be true!

I’d be lost without you!



-CHORUS-

Hand in hand they will cross the land

From the East coast out to L.A.!

Where the movie stars play!

We’ll make life there, and stay alive there

Have no fears like the flyin’ heres

In their covered wagons they’ll go!

Handsome hearthrobs move over!

Will’s the new face to know!

Rogers, and Rogers, and Rogers, Rogers, Rogers, Rogers

It’s the big time!!!

Westward Ho!!!!
