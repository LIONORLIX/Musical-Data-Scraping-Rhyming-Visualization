The Big Time


-WILL-

Hand in hand we will cross the land

From the West coast way up to Maine

Boarding train after train

See the nation, along vacation

What?s to fear?  We?re together here

But my dear before we can go

Vaudeville has traditions

My young wife ought to know:



There?s the small time, and the medium time, and the big time, and the medium-small time



-BETTY-

Small time, and the medium time, and the big time?



-WILL-

And Kiwanis Hall time!

Big time looks down on medium time?



-BETTY-

Looks down on small time?



-WILL-

Looks down on accordion players

Small time?



-BETTY-

Big time?



-BOTH-

Big, small, medium time!

On the road from Maine to Dallas

Hoping that we?ll play the Palace!



-WILL-

Smiles from you are a rave review

Put a big time star on my door

I can hear the crowds roar

Spotlight hits me, the spotlight fits me

When you touch me, and when you hold me

My name lights up the marquee

Just to know that you love me

Is the big time for me!



-BETTY-

There?s a small time, and a medium time, and a big time, and a medium-small time

Packing, unpacking, and packing, we?re off to Altuna

Tomorrow, goodbye Altuna!

Cooking, scrubbing, washing, ironing

Mend his britches, feed his pony

Learn to live on cold baloney

Smiles from him make my senses swim

I get big time feelings inside

Once an ignorant bride

Now I?m knowing, and all aglowing!

When he holds me, and when he loves me

We?re close as lovers can be!

On the circuit together

Life is joyous and free!

Thank goodness we have no family,

There?s only Will and me!



-WILL JR.-

Howdy!  I?m Will Rogers, Jr.!



-MARY-

Howdy, I?m Mary Rogers!



-JAMES-

Howdy, I?m James Rogers!



-FRED-

Howdy!



-CHILDREN-

Well here comes Freddy!

We?re glad our dad?s in Vaudeville

And we?ve got fun!

?Cause we bag down in any town,

Not just in one!

Before we?re bored with kids we meet,

We got our van!

There?s no mean ol? school superintendent

Hounding us ?cause we?re independent!

At night our mommy reads to us, and hears us pray!

Then we sneak to the musical, watch daddy play!

Scratch your skull, tilt your head, make the people glad!

Folks ask us what we wanna be

When we grow up we?re gonna be

Just? like? dad!



-ALL-

From the small time, to the medium time, to the big time

No more medium-small time!

Up, up

Climbing up, up

No more small time

Or Kiwanis Hall time!

Finish packing, let?s get cracking

Wear your boots, it?s gonna rain

Do your homework on the train!

Smiles from us are a family plus

We?re together getting along

Sometimes weak sometimes strong

Sad or happy, or mad or scrappy!

Nothing is easy, and nothing?s perfect

We still complain and we fight

But ?long as we stay together

It?s the big time for us!

Rogers, and Rogers, and Rogers, Rogers, Rogers, Rogers

It?s the big time for us!
