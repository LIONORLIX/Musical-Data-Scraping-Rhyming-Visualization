Where Are You?


Prince Herbert:

Where are you? Where are you?

Where are you, my heart's desire?

My heart is true, but where are you?

Only you can quench the fire.



Where are you? Where are you



Prince Herbert's Father:

Stop it! Stop that! Stop all that singing!



Prince Herbert:

I knew someone would come.

I knew that somewhere out there, there must be...



Here are you! Here are you!

Here are you, Sir Lancelot!



Prince Herbert's Father:

Stop it! Stop it! Who are you?



Prince Herbert:

I'm your son.



Prince Herbert's Father:

Not you!
