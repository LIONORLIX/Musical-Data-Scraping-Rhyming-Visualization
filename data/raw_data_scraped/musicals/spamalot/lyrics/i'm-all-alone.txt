I'm All Alone


King Arthur:

I'm all alone

all by myself

there is no one here beside me

im all alone

quite, all alone

no one to comfort me or guide me

why is there no one here with me

on the long and winding road

to lift my heavy load

if there were someone here with me

how happy i would be

but im alone

quite all alone

all by myself im all alone



I'm all alone

(Patsy: he's all alone)

All by myself

(Patsy: except for me)

I cannot face tomorrow

(Patsy: he cannot face it)

I'm all alone

(Patsy: Though i am here)

So all alone

(Patsy: so very near)

No one to share my sorrow



Patsy:

You know it seems quite clear to me

because im working class

i am just the horses ass

he sells me down the river

so what am i, chopped liver?



Arthur:

But i'm alone

(Patsy: oh no you're not!)

So all alone

(Patsy: I'm here you twat!)

All by myself im all alone



Knitghts: he's all alone

Arthur: i'm all alone

Knights: all by himself

Arthur: all by myself

Knights: there is no one here beside him, He's all alone

Arthur: so all alone

Knights: apart from us,

No one to comfort him or guide him



Arthur: each one of us is all alone

so what are we to do

in order to get through

we must be lonely side by side

it's a perfect way to hide



Knights: we're all alone

Arthur: we're all alone

Knights: yes all alone

Arthur: so all alone,

each by ourselves

we're all alone.
