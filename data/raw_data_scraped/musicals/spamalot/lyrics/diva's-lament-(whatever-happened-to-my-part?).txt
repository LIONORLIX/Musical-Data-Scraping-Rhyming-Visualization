Diva's Lament (Whatever Happened to My Part?)


LADY OF THE LAKE:

What ever happened to my part?

It was exciting at the start.

Now we're halfway through Act 2

And I've had nothing yet to do.



I've been offstage for far too long

It's ages since I had a song.

This is one unhappy Diva

The producer's have deceived her.

There is nothing I can sing from my heart.

Whatever Happened to My Part?



I am sick of my career

Always starting second gear

Up to here, with frustration and with fears.

I've no Grammy no Rewards,

I've no Tony Awards,

I'm Constantly replaced with Britney Spears

Britney Spears



Whatever Happened to My Show?

I was a hit, now I don't know.

I'm with a bunch of British Knights,

Prancing 'round in woolly tights.



I might as well go to the Pub

They've been out searching for a shrub

Out shopping for a Bush

Well they can kiss my Tush

It seems to me they've really lost the plot



Whatever Happened to My

I'll Call my Agent, Dammit

Whatever Happened to My

Not Yours, Not Yours,

By My,

Part!



[Thanks to Blair for lyrics]
