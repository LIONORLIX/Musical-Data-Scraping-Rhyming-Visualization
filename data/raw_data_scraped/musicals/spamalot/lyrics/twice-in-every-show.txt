Twice In Every Show


LADY:

But you're not alone, Arthur!

Haven't you noticed?

I've been with you all the time!

Who gave you the sword?

Who made you king?

Who helped you find the quest?

Sure, I've been offstage for far too long

But, we had that great lounge number in Act One.

And, oh! We do scat great together!

No, no, I'm no Patsy

But I am here to help you

And I always have been!



ARTHUR:

And you really want me?



LADY:

More than ever!



BOTH:

Twice in every show!

There comes a song like this!

It starts off soft and low

And ends up with a kiss.

Oh, this is the scene

That ends like this.



LADY:

Find the grail, Arthur!

And when you do,

I'll be there

Waiting for you!

Goodbye!

Goodbye!

Goodbye!
