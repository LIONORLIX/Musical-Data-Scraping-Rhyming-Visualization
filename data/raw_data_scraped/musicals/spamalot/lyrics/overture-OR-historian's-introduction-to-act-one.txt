Overture / Historian's Introduction to Act One


A FAMOUS HISTORIAN:



England, 932 A.D. A kingdom divided. To the West, the Anglo-Saxons.

To the East, the French. Above, nothing but Celts and some people from Scotland.



In Guinard, Palace, and Difford, plague.

In the kingdoms of Wessex, Sussex, Essex and Kent, plague.

In Mercia, and the two Anglias, plague, with a 50% chance of pestilence

and famine coming out of the Northeast at twelve miles per hour.



Legend tells us of an extrodanairy leader who arose from the chaos to unite a troubled kingdom.

A man with a vision, who gathered knights together in a Holy Quest.

This man was Arthur, King of the Britains, for this was England!
