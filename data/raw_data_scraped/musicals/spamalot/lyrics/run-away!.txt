Run Away!


Bravely Robin ran away, (No!)

Bravely ran away, away. (I didn't!)



When danger reared its ugly head,

he bravely turned his tail and fled. (No!)

Yes, brave Sir Robin turned about (I didn't)

And gallantly, he chickened out.



Bravely taking to his feet, (I never did!)

He beat a very brave retreat, (Oh, lie!)

Bravest of the brave, Sir Robin. (I never!)
