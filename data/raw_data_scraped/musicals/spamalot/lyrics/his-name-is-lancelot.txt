His Name Is Lancelot


Herbert:

Lancelot you might as well just fess up

Really you're a different kind of guy

move aside your scabbard

for underneath your tabard

there is wating to escape a butterfly



Knights:

his name is Lancelot

and in tight pants alot

he likes to dance alot

you know you do

(Lancelot: i do?)

so just say thanks alot

and try romance its hott

lets find out who's really you!

his name is Lancelot

he visits France alot

he likes to dance alot

and dream

no one would ever know

that this outrageous rogue

bats for the other team



Herbert:

You're a knight who really likes his night life

and by day you really like to play

you can all find him

pumping at the gym

at the Camelot Y-M-C-A



Knights:

His name is Lancelot

just watch him dance alot

he doesnt care what people say

(Lancelot: no way!)

oh when he starts to dance

just grab your underpants



Herbert:

He can finally come out and say that

he is G-A-Y-...M-C-A!



Knights: hes gay!



Lancelot: okay!
