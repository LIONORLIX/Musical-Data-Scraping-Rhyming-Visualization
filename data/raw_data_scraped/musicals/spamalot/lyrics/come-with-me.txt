Oh, Lady of the Lake, please reveal to this doubting Dennis that you are real.

Cor! Blimey!



LAKER GIRLS:

Ahhhhh... etc.



LADY OF THE LAKE:

Come with me

Come with me

Come with me

Sweet Galahad



You'll be a man

Join Arthur's clan

Come with me

And I will make you glad



Galahad

Sweet Galahad

Be a knight

It's time to take your bow

If you come with me now

I'll show you how



DENNIS/GALAHAD:

Oh, wow.



ARTHUR (spoken):

Stand aside, Mrs. Galahad, while the Lady of the Lake

and her Laker Girls welcome your son to my army.
