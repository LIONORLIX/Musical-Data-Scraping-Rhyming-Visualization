We Can Do It


MAX:

Don't you see, Bloom. Darling Bloom, glorious Bloom. It's so simple.

Step One: we find the worst play ever written.

Step Two: we hire the worst director in town.

Step Three: I raise two million dollars...

LEO:

Two?

MAX:

Yes! One for me, one for you. There's a lot of little old ladies out there.

Step Four: We hire the worst actors in New York and open on Broadway.

And before you can say Step Five, we close on Broadway, take our two million and go to Rio.

LEO:

Rio? Nah, that'd never work.

MAX:

Oh ye of little faith.

What did Lewis say to Clark

When everything looked bleak?

What did Sir Edmund say to Tenzing

As they struggled toward Everest's peak?

What did Washington say to his troops

As they crossed the Delaware

I'm sure you're well aware...

LEO:

What'd they say?

MAX:

We can do it, we can do it

We can do it, me and you

We can do it, we can do it

We can make our dreams come true

Everything you've ever wanted

Is just waiting to be had

Beautiful girls, wearing nothing but pearls

Caressing you, undressing you

And driving you mad

We can do it, we can do it

This is not the time to shirk

We can do it, you won't rue it

Say goodbye to petty clerk

Hi, producer: yes, producer

I mean you, sir, go beserk!

We can do it, we can do it

And I know it's gonna work

Whatta ye say, Bloom?

LEO:

What do I say

Finally a chance to be a Broadway producer!

What do I say?

Finally a chance to make my dreams come true, sir!

What do I say, what do I say

Here's what I say to you, sir...

I can't do it, I can't do it

I can't do it, that's not me

I'm a loser, I'm a coward

I'm a chicken, don't you see?

When it comes to wooing women

There's a few things that I lack

Beautiful girls, wearing nothing but pearls...

Cashing me, embracing me

I'd have an attack

MAX:

Why, you miserable, cowardly, wretched little caterpillar!

Don't you ever want to become a butterfly?

Don't you want to spread your wings and flap your way to glory?

MAX:

We can do it



We can do it



We can grab that holy grail!



We can do it



We can do it



Drink champagne, not ginger ale



Come on, Leo

Can't you see-o ...





LEO:

Mr. Bialystock

Please stop the song

You've got me wrong

I'll say "so long"

I'm not as strong

A person as you think

Mr. Bialystock

Just take a look

I'm not a crook

I'm just a shnook

The bottom line

Is that I stink!

I...can't...

Do...it!

LEO:

You see Rio, I see jail!

MAX:

We can do it!

LEO:

I can't do it!

MAX:

We can do it!

LEO:

I cannot, cannot, cannot

'Cause I know it's gonna fail

MAX:

We can do it!

MAX:

I know it cannot fail





LEO:

It's gonna fail
