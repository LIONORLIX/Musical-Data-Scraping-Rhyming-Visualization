It's Bad Luck to Say Good Luck on Op'ning Night


ROGER:

Ah, it's Bialystock and Bloom. Well, gentlemen ... merde!

CARMEN:

Toi, toi, toi

FRANZ:

Hals und Beinbruch!

LEO:

And I just want to wish everybody ... good luck!

CARMEN:

Ahhhhh!

ROGER:

Mr. Bloom, hasn't anyone ever told you...

It's bad luck to say "good luck" on opening night

If you do, I tell you

It is certain by the curtain

You are through!

MAX:

Good luck!

CARMEN:

It's bad luck to say "good luck" on opening night

Once it's said, you are dead

You will get the worst reviews

You've ever read!

MAX:

Good luck!

ROGER:

Even at the Comedie-Francaise,

On the opening night they are scared

"Bon chance, mes amis", no one says

The only word you ever hear is...

ROGER, CARMEN & FRANZ:

Merde!

MAX:

Good luck, good luck, good luck

FRANZ:

It's verboten, vishing "luck" on opening night

Take advice, don't think twice

Or your show will surely end

Up in the Scheiss!

MAX:

Guten lucken.

CARMEN:

At the famous La Scala in Milan On opening night it's a rule

"In boccu lupa" they say with elan

And just for luck they all shout...

ROGER, CARMEN & FRANZ:

"Bah fongool!"

LEO:

I got it!

Now I'll never say "good luck" on opening night

That's the rule, I'm no fool!

What do I say, I beg?

ROGER, CARMEN & FRANZ:

What you say is "break a leg"!

LEO:

Break a leg?

ROGER, CARMEN & FRANZ:

Yes, break a leg!

LEO, ROGER, CARMEN & FRANZ:

If you're clever...

MAX:

Good luck!

LEO, ROGER, CARMEN & FRANZ:

You'll endeavour

To never, never, never, never

Ever, ever, ever say...

...on opening night!
