Overture and Opening Night


USHERETTE #1 & #2:

Opening night...

It's opening night!

It's Max Bialystock's latest show

Will it flop or will it go?

The cast is taking its final bow

Here comes the audience now

The doors are open: they're on their way...

Let's hear what they have to say!



FIRST NIGHTERS:

He's done it again

He's done it again

Max Bialystock has done it again!

We can't believe it

You can't conceive it...



MAN FIRST NIGHTER:

How'd he achieve it?



FIRST NIGHTERS:

It's the worst show in town!

We sat there sighing

Groaning and crying

There's no denying

It's the worst show in town!



WOMEN FIRST NIGHTERS:

Oh, we wanted to stand up and hiss...



MEN FIRST NIGHTERS:

We've seen shit...



FIRST NIGHTERS:

But never like this!

Max Bialystock has done it again!

The songs were rotten

The book was stinkin'

What he did to Shakespeare

Booth did to Lincoln!

We couldn't leave faster...



USHERETTE #1 & #2:

What a disaster!



FIRST NIGHTERS & USHERETTES:

We are still in shock

Who produced this shlock?

That slimey, sleazy Max Bialystock

What a bum!!
