Where Did We Go Right?


MAX:

Look at these reviews!

"A satiric masterpiece."

LEO:

No way out.

MAX:

"A surprise smash!"

LEO:

No way out.

MAX:

"It was shocking, outrageous, insulting...and I loved every minute of it!"

LEO:

No way out.

MAX:

How could this happen?

The show was lousy and long

We did everything wrong

Where did we go right?

LEO:

"Christmas came early to Broadway this year -

and guess who they stuffed in our stocking? Adolf Hitler!"

MAX:

It was so crass and so crude

Even Goebbels would've booed

Where did we go right?

LEO:

"Last night a star was born on Broadway - the lovely Miss Ulla

Inga Hansen Bensen Yonsen Tallen-Hallen Svaden-Svanson.

We predict that her name will soon be up in lights. If they can find enough bulbs.

MAX & LEO:

We searched Broadway on and off

For singers with a cough

We had tryouts and auditions by the score

And to trip the light fantastic

We picked dancers who were spastic

If anyone jeted, we jeted them out the door!

MAX:

They shouted hooray

For that sausage on display

Where did we go right?

LEO:

Our leading man was so gay

He nearly flew away

Where did we go right?

MAX:

A show so easy to despise...

LEO:

Now it's up for the Pulitzer Prize!

MAX & LEO:

Oh, where, oh, where, tell us

Where did we go right?

MAX:

"The best new music of the decade! Max Bialystock is a theatrical genius!"

Now they like me!

Oh, we knew we couldn't lose

MAX & LEO:

Half the audience were Jews!

LEO:

It's the end of our careers

MAX:

It'll run for twenty years!

MAX & LEO:

Tell us where...

Did we go right?!
