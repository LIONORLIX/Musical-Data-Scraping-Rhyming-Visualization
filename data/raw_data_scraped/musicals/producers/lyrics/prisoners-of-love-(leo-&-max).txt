Gentlemen, it breaks my heart to break up such a beautiful friendship.

So I won't. Five years in the state penitentiary at Sing Sing.

Gotta sing ... sing!

CONVICT #2:

Gotta sing ... sing!

MAX:

Okay, boys, break's over. Let's take it from the top.

Sing out, boys! Let 'em hear you in solitary!

Oh, you can lock us up

And lose the key

But hearts in love

Are always free!

Prisoners of love

Blue skies above

'Cause we're still prisoners

MAX:

Take it home, boys. We open in Leavenworth Saturday night.

MAX & CONVICTS:

We're still prisoners

We're still prisoners of love

PRISON GUARD:

Hey, Bialystock, Bloom, Liebkind, good news! This just came from the governor:

"Gentlemen, you are hereby granted a full pardon for having -

through song and dance - brought joy and laughter into the hearts of

every murderer, rapist and sex maniac in Sing Sing."

You're free!

LEO:

Free!

Next stop, Broadway!

But hearts in love are always free!

LEO & MAX:

Leo and Max

Up off our backs

Back on the Great White Way!

Leo and Max

Back on our tracks

We're back on top to stay!

So when we take your money, never fear

We'll knock Broadway right on its ear

The cast is great

The script is swell

But this we're tellin' you, sirs

It's just no go, you got no show

Without the producers!

We'll never quit

Hit after hit

You and me-o

We guarantee-o

You're lookin' at Leo

And Max!!

ENTIRE ENSEMBLE:

The producers, Leo and Max!
