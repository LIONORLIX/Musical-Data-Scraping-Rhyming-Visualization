When You Got It, Flaunt It


ULLA:

Ven you got it, flaunt it

Step right up and strut your stuff

People tell you modesty's a wirtue

But in the theatre modesty can hurt you

Ven you got it, flaunt it

Show your assets, let them know you're proud

Your goodies you must push

Stick out your chest, shake your tush

Ven you got it, shout it out loud

Now Ulla dance.

Ven you got it, show it

Put your hidden treasures on display

Violinists love to play an E-string

But audiences really love a G-string

Ven you got it, should it!

Let the whole vorld hear vat you're about

Clothes may make the man

All a girl needs is a tan

Ven you got it, let it hang out!

Remember ven Ulla dance?

MAX & LEO:

Yeah!

ULLA:

Ulla dance again!

Ven I was yust a little girl in Sveden

My thoughtful mother gave me this advice

If nature blesses you from top to bottom

Show that top to bottom, don't think twice

Now Ulla belt!

Don't think twice!

Ven you got it, share it

Let the public feast upon your charms

People say that being prim is proper

But ev'ry showgirl knows that prim will stop her

If you got it, give it

Don't be selfish, give it all a-vay

Don't be shy, be bold 'n' cute

Show the boys your birthday suit

Ven you got it, if you got it

Once you got it, shout out hooray!
