When Someone Comes Into Your Life


When someone comes into your life

Take a chance, my love

Forget all the pain that's inside

Open up your heart

You'll forget as she's touching

Your face that I once held you

In my embrace

It might even feel right when you

Kiss her goodnight and not me

If someone should hold down her hand

Make her yours, my love

Don't know how long it may last,

Oh, how fast love goes

You'll forget me one day, don't you know



But your memories I'll never let go

I will love you the same as I did that

First day I found you

When someone comes into your life

Never close the door

What you're looking for

Might be in your arms at last

Don't run away

When someone comes into your life

Hold fast

When someone looks into your eyes

Don't refuse their love

You can't live the rest of your life

With a broken heart



You'll forget me one day, don't you know

But your memories I'll never let go

And when love comes to stay

I hope she loves you the way

I love you

When someone comes into your life

Never close the door

What you're looking for

Might be in your arms at last

Don't run away

When someone comes into your life

If someone comes into your life

When someone comes into your life

Hold fast, hold fast
