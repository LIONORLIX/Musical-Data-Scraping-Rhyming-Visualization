Doctor I've got this feelin' deep

Inside of me, deep inside of me

I just can't control my feet when

I hear the beat, when I hear the beat

I just don't know, don't know

How I'm gonna deal with you

Doc, Doc, Doc, Doc, Doctor Beat

I just don't know, don't know

Won't you help me Doctor Beat

Doc, Doc, Doc, Doc, Doctor Beat

won't you help me Doctor Beat

Doc, Doc, Doc, Doc, Doctor Beat

Shake Shake Shake your body

Baby Shake Shake Shake Shake your body baby

Shake Shake Shake your body

Baby shake your body baby,

Do the conga

I know you can't control yourself any longer

Feel the rhythm of the music getting stronger

Don't you fight it till you've tried it

Do the conga beat

Everybody gather 'round now

Let your body feel the heat.

Don't you worry if you can't dance

Let the music move your feet.

At night when you turn off all the lights

There's no place that you can hide

Oh no, the rhythm is gonna get'cha

The rhythm is gonna get'cha

Rhythm is gonna get'cha

Rhythm is gonna get'cha

Rhythm is gonna get you

The rhythm is gonna get you tonight

7,6,5,4,3,2,1

1-2-3-4 come on baby say you love me

5-6-7 times

8-9-10-11 I'm just gonna keep on counting

Until you are mine

Get on your feet

Get on your feet

Get up and make it happen

Get on your feet

Get on your feet

You say I know it's a waste of time

There's no use trying

So scared that life's gonna pass you by

Your spirit dying

Deep in your heart is the answer

Find it, I know it will pull you through

Get on your feet

Get on your feet
