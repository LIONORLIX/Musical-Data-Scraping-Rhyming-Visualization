What in this world, feels so alive

Makes us then breaks us

Then helps us survive

Buries our hopes, then revives

Our desire to succeed

We're all greed



Who in this world, see's when i cry

Throws me then shows me

That i'm justified

Measure my worth then decide

That i'm not what they need

They've agreed



Where in this world can i hide

Where can i find

Someone that see's me inside

To confide



How in this world, can i go on

Wondering if you'll think

Of me when i'm gone

Shielding my eyes from

The pityless light of the glare

Should you care



When in this world is it enough

I never thought

It could be quite this rough

Living my life as if

Millions of people don't stare

They're not there



Why should i have to defend

Or derive

Most of the rules of the game,

I've defied

Though it's been hard on my pride

It's been one hell of a ride

Curiously..

I didn't set out to be..
