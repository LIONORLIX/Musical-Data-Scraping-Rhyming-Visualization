The American And Florence Nobodys Side


[FLORENCE]

You want to lose your only friend?

Well, keep it up, you're doing fine

Why this humiliation?

Why treat me like a fool?

I've taken shit for seven years

And I won't take it anymore



[THE AMERICAN]

I'm only teasing Soviets

With gentle bonhomie

And you've a better reason to be anti-them than me.



[FLORENCE]

There's a time and there's a place.



[THE AMERICAN]

Is this the girl who always said

She wants to know the truth?



[FLORENCE]

There's a time and there's a place...



[CHORUS]

1956 -- Budapest is rising

1956 -- Budapest is fighting

1956 -- Budapest is falling

1956 -- Budapest is dying



[THE AMERICAN]

I'd have thought you'd support

Any attack on these people

On the people who ran

Mindlessly over your childhood

Don't let them fool you for

Thirty years on they're the same



They see chess as a war

Playing with pawns just like Poland

If you walk out on me

They will have won their first battle

Wouldn't your father

Have begged you to stay in the game?



[FLORENCE]

He would -- but he didn't know you

He'd loathe your behaviour and so do I --

Why'd you have to do this to me?



What's going on around me

Is barely making sense

I need some explanations fast

I see my present partner

In the imperfect tense

And I don't see how we can last

I feel I need a change of cast

Maybe I'm on nobody's side



And when he gives me reasons

To justify each move

They're getting harder to believe

I know this can't continue

I've still a lot to prove

There must be more I could achieve

But I don't have the nerve to leave



Everybody's playing the game

But nobody's rules are the same

Nobody's on nobody's side

Better learn to go it alone

Recognize you're out on your own

Nobody's on nobody's side



The one I should not think of

Keeps rolling through my mind

And I don't want to let that go

No lovers ever faithful

No contract truly signed

There's nothing certain left to know

And how the cracks begin to show!



Never make a promise or plan

Take a little love where you can

Nobody's on nobody's side

Never stay too long in your bed

Never lose your heart, use your head

Nobody's on nobody's side



Never take a stranger's advice

Never let a friend fool you twice

Nobody's on nobody's side

Everybody's playing the game

But nobody's rules are the same

Nobody's on nobody's side



Never leave a moment too soon

Never waste a hot afternoon

Nobody's on nobody's side

Never stay a minute too long

Don't forget the best will go wrong

Nobody's on nobody's side



Never be the first to believe

Never be the last to deceive

Nobody's on nobody's side

Never make a promise or plan...
