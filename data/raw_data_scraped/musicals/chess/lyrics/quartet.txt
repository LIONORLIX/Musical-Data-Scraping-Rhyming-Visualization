(A Model Of Decoruim And Tranquility)



[MOLOKOV]

We wish, no must, make our disgust

at this abuse perfectly clear.

We're here for chess -- are the U.S.?

If so, why foul the

atmosphere?



[FLORENCE]

I must protest -- our delegation has a host of valid points to

raise,

Our player's sporting attitude's beyond all praise,

as any neutral would attest

But we concede the fact his masters bend the rules is not

a player's fault --

We'll overlook their crude political assault

and under protest will proceed



[MOLOKOV]

We wish, no must, make our disgust

at this abuse perfectly clear

we're here for chess -- are the U.S.?

How can you make such a

claim?



[MOLOKOV]



If your man's so sweet

Then why his fighting talk?

If he's not a cheat

Then why on earth

Did he go take a walk?



[ARBITER]



Point 17

No one-way screen

Will be allowed

In the hall



[MOLOKOV]

Why let him loose?

He'll soon reduce

This great event

To a brawl



It's very sad

To see the ancient and

Distinguished game

That used to be



[FLORENCE]



I am not surprised

He wanted fresher air

Once he realized

There was no hope

Of your lot playing fair

How sad

To see

What used

To be



[BOTH]

A model of decorum and tranquillity

Become like any other sport

A battleground for rival ideologies

To slug it out with glee



[THE RUSSIAN]

Through the elegant yelling

disgust

Of this compelling dispute

clear

Comes the ghastly suspicion

are the U.S.?

My opposition's a fruit

atmosphere?



[MOLOKOV]

We wish, no must, make our



At this abuse perfectly



We're here for chess --



If so, why foul the



[FLORENCE]



I don't suppose

You'd understand the strain and pressure

getting where he's got

For then you'd simply call him

highly strung and not

Imply that he was one of those



[ARBITER]



Point 23

The board will be

Made in Sweden

Non-aligned wood



[THE RUSSIAN]

But how can you

Work for one who

waiting here

Treats you like dirt?

Pay must be good

is our



[MOLOKOV]

It seems to us

There's little point in



all night for his return

And since a peaceful match



sole concern



[FLORENCE]



I'm not getting rich

My only interest

Is in something which

Gives me the chance

Of working with the best



[MOLOKOV]

We won't make an official fuss



In short we rise

Above your guy's

Tantrums, dramas,

Dirty tricks



[THE RUSSIAN]



I can only say

I hope your dream comes true

Till that far-off day

I hope you cope

With helping number two.



[ARBITER]



Point 31

No game begun

By noon goes on

After six



[THE RUSSIAN & FLORENCE]

How sad

To see



[ARBITER & MOLOKOV]

It's very sad to see

The ancient and distinguished game that used to be



[ALL]

A model of decorum and tranquillity

Become like any other sport

A battleground for rival ideologies

To slug it out with glee
