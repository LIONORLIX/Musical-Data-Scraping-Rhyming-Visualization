Epilogue: You And I The Story (Reprise)


[ANATOLY]

Knowing I want you

Knowing I love you

Cannot compare

With my despair

Knowing I've lost you.



[FLORENCE]

I've been a fool to allow

Dreams to become

Great expectations.



[ANATOLY]

How can I love you so much

Yet make no move?



[BOTH]

There will be days and nights

When I'll want you more than I want to

More than I should

Oh, how I want you.



You and I

We've seen it all

Chasing our hearts' desire

But we go on pretending

Stories like ours

Have happy endings.



[ANATOLY]

You could not give me

More than you gave me

I don't know why

I'm standing by

Watching this happen.



[FLORENCE]

I won't look back anymore

And if I do -- just for a moment.



[ANATOLY]

I can't imagine a time when I won't care.



[BOTH]

But here we are today, and it's over

Hold me and tell me

We'll meet again

Why is it over?



You and I

We've seen it all

Chasing our hearts' desire

But we go on pretending

Stories like ours

Have happy endings.
