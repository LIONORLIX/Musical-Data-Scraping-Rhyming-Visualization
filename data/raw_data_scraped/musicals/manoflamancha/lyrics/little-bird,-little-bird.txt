Little Bird, Little Bird


ANSELMO, PEDRO

(two Muleteers)

Little bird, little bird,

In the cinnamon tree,

Little bird, little bird,

Do you sing for me?

Do you bring me word

Of one I know?

Little bird, little bird,

I love her so,

Little bird, little bird,

I have to know

Little bird, little bird.

Beneath this tree,

This cinnamon tree,

We learned to love,

We learned to cry;

For here we met

And here we kissed,

And here one cold and moonless night

We said goodbye



ANSELMO

Little bird, little bird,

Oh have pity on me

Bring her back to me now

'Neath the cinnamon tree,

I have waited too long

Without a song.

Little bird, little bird,

Please fly, please go

little bird, little bird,

And tell her so.

Little bird, little bird.



PEDRO, MULETEERS

Little bird, little bird. etc.
