Finale (The Impossible Dream)


DON QUIXOTE

(courteously, but without recognition.)

Now then. What is it you want?



ALDONZA

Don't you know me?



DON QUIXOTE

Should I?



ALDONZA

I am Aldonza!



DON QUIXOTE

I'm sorry. I do not recall anyone of that name.



ALDONZA

Sancho knows. Please, my Lord.



DON QUIXOTE

Why did you say "my lord"? I am not a lord.



ALDONZA

You are my lord, Don Quixote!



DON QUIXOTE

Don Quixote? You must forgive me, I have been ill...

I'm confused by shadows. It is possible I knew you once,

but I do not remember



ALDONZA

Please! Try to remember!



DON QUIXOTE

Is it so important?



ALDONZA

Everything. My whole life.

You spoke to me and everything was... different!



DON QUIXOTE

I spoke to you?

ALDONZA

And you looked at me! A

nd you called me by another name!
