Finale


ALDONZA

To dream the impossible dream,

To fight the unbeatable foe,



PADRE

To bear with unbearable sorrow

To run where the brave dare not go...



ANTONIA

To run where the brave dare not go,

Though the goal be forever too far.



SANCHO, ANTONIA

To try, though you're wayworn and weary,



PADRE, ANTONIA, SANCHO, BARBER

To reach the unreachable star.



ALL

To reach the unreachable star,

Though you know it's impossibly high,

To live with your heart striving upward

To a far, unattainable sky!
