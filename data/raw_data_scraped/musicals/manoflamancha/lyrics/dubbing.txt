Dubbing


INNKEEPER

Don Quixote de La Mancha,

Having proved yourself this day

In glorious and terrible combat,

And by my authority as lord of this castle...

I hereby dub thee knight!



DON QUIXOTE

But, your Lordship...



INNKEEPER

Didn't I do it right?



DON QUIXOTE

If Your Lordship could make some mention of the deeds

I performed to earn this honor...?



INNKEEPER

Of course.



DON QUIXOTE

And it is customary to grant

the new knight an added name.

If Your Lordship could devise

such a name for me...?



INNKEEPER

Hmmm.
