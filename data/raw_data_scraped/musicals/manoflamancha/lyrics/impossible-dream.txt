Impossible Dream


(The Quest)



ALDONZA

Why do you do these things?



DON QUIXOTE

What things?



ALDONZA

These ridiculous... the things you do!



DON QUIXOTE

I hope to add some measure of grace to the world.



ALDONZA

The world's a dung heap and we are maggots that crawl on it!



DON QUIXOTE

My Lady knows better in her heart.



ALDONZA

What's in my heart will get me halfway to hell.

And you, Se?or Don Quixote-you're going to take

such a beating!



DON QUIXOTE

Whether I win or lose does not matter.



ALDONZA

What does?



DON QUIXOTE

Only that I follow the quest.



ALDONZA

(spits)

That for your Quest!

(turns, marches away; stops, turns bock

and asks, awkwardly)

What does that mean... quest?



DON QUIXOTE

It is the mission of each true knight...

His duty... nay, his privilege!

To dream the impossible dream,

To fight the unbeatable foe,

To bear with unbearable sorrow

To run where the brave dare not go;

To right the unrightable wrong.



To love, pure and chaste, from afar,

To try, when your arms are too weary,

To reach the unreachable star!



This is my Quest to follow that star,

No matter how hopeless, no matter how far,

To fight for the right

Without question or pause,

To be willing to march into hell

For a heavenly cause!



And I know, if I'll only be true

To this glorious Quest,

That my heart will lie peaceful and calm

When I'm laid to my rest.



And the world will be better for this,

That one man, scorned and covered with scars,

Still strove, with his last ounce of courage,

To reach the unreachable stars!
