Dulcinea


DON QUIXOTE

(enters the inn)

Sweet lady... fair virgin...



(Don Quixote averts his eyes worshipfully)

I dare not gaze full upon thy countenance

Lest I be blinded by beauty. But I implore

Thee - speak once thy name.



ALDONZA

Aldonza.



DON QUIXOTE

My lady jests.



ALDONZA

Aldonza!



DON QUIXOTE

The name of a kitchen-scullion... or perhaps my

lady's serving-maid?



ALDONZA

I told you my name! Now get out of the way.

(She clears past him to the table.)



DON QUIXOTE

(Smiling, sill keeping his eyes averted)

Did my lady think to put me to a test?

Ah, sweet sovereign of my captive heart. I shall

not fail thee, for I know...



I have dreamed thee too long,

Never seen thee or touched thee.

But known thee with all of my heart.

Half a prayer, half a song,

Thou hast always been with me,

Though we have been always apart.



Dulcinea... Dulcinea...

I see heaven when I see thee, Dulcinea,

And thy name is like a prayer

An angel whispers... Dulcinea... Dulcinea!



If I reach out to thee,

Do not tremble and shrink

From the touch of my hand on thy hair.

Let my fingers but see

Thou art warm and alive,

And no phantom to fade in the air.



Dulcinea... Dulcinea...

I have sought thee, sung thee,

Dreamed thee, Dulcinea!



Now I've found thee,

And the world shall know thy glory,

Dulcinea... Dulcinea!



(The scene reverts to the prison where Cervantes

tells of Don Quixote's family and friends who are

worried about his mental state)
