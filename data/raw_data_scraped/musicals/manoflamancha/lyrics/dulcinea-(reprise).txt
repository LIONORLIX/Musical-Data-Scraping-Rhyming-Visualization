Dulcinea (Reprise)


ALDONZA

Dulcinea... Dulcinea...

Once you found a girl

And called her Dulcinea,

When you spoke the name

An angel seemed to whisper...

Dulcinea... Dulcinea...



Dulcinea... Dulcinea...

Won't you please bring back

The dream of Dulcinea...

Won't you bring me back

The bright and shining glory

Of Dulcinea... Dulcinea...



DON QUIXOTE

Then perhaps... it was not a dream...



ALDONZA

(kneeling beside Quixote again.)

You spoke of a dream. And about the Quest!



DON QUIXOTE

Quest?



ALDONZA

Yes, how you must fight and it doesn't matter whether

you win or lose if only you follow the Quest!



DON QUIXOTE

The words. Tell me the words!
