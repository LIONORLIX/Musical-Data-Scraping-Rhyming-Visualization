Barber's Song


DON QUIXOTE

Someone approaches...!



SANCHO

Just an ordinary traveler.



DON QUIXOTE

(pointing off)

But see what he wears upon his head.

Get thee to a place of hiding, Sancho.



SANCHO

Oh, dear!



BARBER

(from a distance)

Oh, I am a little barber

And I go my merry way

With my razor and my leeches

I can always earn my pay



Though your chin be smooth as satin,

You will need me soon I know

For the Lord protects his barbers,

And He makes the stubble grow.



If I slip when I am shaving you

And cut you to the quick,

You can use me as a doctor

'Cause I also heal the sick.
