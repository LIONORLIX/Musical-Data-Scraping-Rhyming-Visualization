Golden Helmet of Mambrino


DON QUIXOTE

Hand over that golden helmet!



BARBER

But this is a shaving basin!



DON QUIXOTE

Shaving basin! Know thou not what this really is?

The Golden Helmet of Mambrino!

When worn by one of noble heart, it renders

him invulnerable to all wounds!

(to the Barber whacking the barrel with his sword)

Hand it over!



Thou Golden Helmet of Mambrino,

With so illustrious a past,

Too long hast thou been lost to glory,

Th'art rediscovered now at last!

Golden Helmet of Mambrino

There can be no hat like thee!

Thou and I now, ere I die now,

Will make golden history!



BARBER

(aside to Sancho)

I can hear the cuckoo singing

In the cuckooberry tree...



SANCHO

(aside to Barber)

If he says that that's a helmet,

I suggest that you agree...



BARBER

(aside to Sancho)

But he'll find it is not gold

And will not make him bold and brave...



SANCHO

(aside to Barber)

Well, at least he'll find it useful

If he ever needs a shave!



DON QUIXOTE

Thou Golden Helmet of Mambrino,

Thy deeds the world will not forget,

Now Don Quixote de La Mancha,

Will bring thee greater glory yet!



DON QUIXOTE, BARBER, SANCHO, MULETEERS

Golden Helmet of Mambrino

There can be no hat like thee.



DON QUIXOTE

Thou and I now, ere I die now,

Will make golden history!



BARBER, SANCHO, MULETEERS

Golden Helmet of Mambrino

Will make golden history!
