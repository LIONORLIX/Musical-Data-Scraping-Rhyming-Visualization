The Impossible Dream (Reprise)


ALDONZA

"To dream the impossible dream"...

but they're your own words!

"To fight the unbeatable foe"...

Don't you remember?

"To be with unbearable sorrow"...

You must remember!

"To run where the brave dare not go!"



DON QUIXOTE

To right the unrightable wrong.



ALDONZA

Yes.



DON QUIXOTE

To love, pure and chaste, from afar



ALDONZA

Yes.



DON QUIXOTE

To try, when your arms are too weary,

To reach the unreachable star!



ALDONZA

Thank you. My Lord!



DON QUIXOTE

But this is not seemly, My Lady.

On thy knees? To me?



.ALDONZA

Oh, my Lord, you are not well!



DON QUIXOTE

Not well? What is sickness to the body of a knight-errant?

What matter wounds? For each time he falls he shall rise

again... and woe to the wicked! Sancho!



SANCHO

Here, Your Grace!

More misadventures!



DON QUIXOTE

Adventures, old friend!
