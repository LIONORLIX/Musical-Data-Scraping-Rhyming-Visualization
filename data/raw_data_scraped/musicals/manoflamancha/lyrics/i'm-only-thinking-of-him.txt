I'm Only Thinking of Him


ANTONIA

(Don Quixote's niece)

(piously)

I'm only thinking of him,

I'm only thinking of him,

Whatever I may do or say;

I'm only thinking of him!

In my body; it's well known,

There is not one selfish bone...

I'm only thinking end worrying about him!



I've been, told he's chasing dragons

And I fear it may be true

If my groom should hear about it.

Heaven knows what he will do!

Oh, I deadly love my uncle,

But for what he's done to me,

I would like to take and lock him up

And throw away the key!

But if I do... but if I do...

There is one thing

That I swear will still be true... PADRE

I'm only thinking of him; I know I know my dear;

I'm only thinking of him; Of course you are, my dear;





I'm only thinking and worrying about him. I understand.



HOUSEKEEPER

I'm only thinking of him,

I'm only thinking of him,

Whatever I may do or say,

I'm only thinking of him!

In the very heart of me

There is Christian charity

I'm only thinking and worrying about him!



Oh, I think he's been too lonely,

Living years without a spouse,

So when he returns

I fear I may have trouble in the house;

For they say he seeks a lady

Who his own true love shall be;

God forbid that in his madness

He should ever think it's me!

If he should try I'll surely die,

And I will grimly

Guard my honor as I cry...

I'm only thinking of him;

I'm only thinking of him;

I'm only thinking and worrying about him.



ANTONIA

Woe, woe, woe, woe, woe, woe,

Woe, woe, woe, woe, woe.



PADRE

I know, I know, my dear;

Of course you are, my dear;

I understand.



HOUSEKEEPER

Woe!



ANTONIA

Woe!



PADRE

They re only thinking of him,

They re only thinking of him,

How saintly is their plaintive plea...

They're only thinking of him!

What a comfort, to be sure,

That their motives are so pure...

As they go thinking and worrying about him!



ANTONIA, HOUSEKEEPER

Woe, woe, woe, woe, woe, etc.
