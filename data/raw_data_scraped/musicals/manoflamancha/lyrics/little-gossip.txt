Little Gossip


SANCHO

Your Reverence, could I talk to him?



PADRE

I'm afraid he won't hear you.



SANCHO

(moving toward the bed)

Then, I won't say much.



PADRE

And no mention of knight-errantry!



SANCHO

Of course not. Does one speak of the rope

in the house of the hanged?

Just a few words... to lighten his heart.



A little gossip... a little chat...

A tittle idle talk of this and that...

I'll tell him all the troubles I have had,

And since he doesn't hear,

At least he won't feel bad.



(to Don Quixote)

When I first got home my wife Teresa beat me,

But the blows fell very lightly on my back.

She kept missing ev'ry other stroke

And crying from the heart

That while I was gone

She'd gone and lost the knack!

Of course, I hit her back, Your Grace,

but she's a lot harder than I am,

and you know what they say...

"Whether the stone hits the pitcher

or the pitcher hits the stone

it's going to be bad for the pitcher"

So I've got bruises from here to...



(to the Padre)

A little gossip... a little chat...

A little idle talk of this and that...

If no one listens,

Then it's just as well,

At least I won't get caught in any lies I tell!



(to Don Quixote)

Oh, I haven't fought a windmill in a fortnight

And the humble joys get duller ev'ry day,

Why, when I'm asleep a dragon

With his fiery tongue a-waggin'

Whispers, "Sancho.

Won't you please come out and play?"
