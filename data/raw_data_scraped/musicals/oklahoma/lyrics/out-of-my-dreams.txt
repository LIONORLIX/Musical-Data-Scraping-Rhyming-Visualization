Out of My Dreams


Laurey and Women Chorus:

Out of your dreams and into his arms

You long to fly

You don't need Egyptian smelling salts to tell you why.

Out of your dreams and into the hush

Of fallin' shadows

When the mist is low

And stars are breakin' through

Then out of your dreams you'd go

Into a dream come true, oh!



Women Chorus:

Make up your mind, make up your mind laurey,

Laurey dear,

Make up your own, make up your own story,

Laurey dear!

Old pharaohs daughters won't tell you what to do

Ask your heart, whatever it tells you will be true

Oh... Ooh ooh oh!



Laurey:

Out of my dreams and into your arms

I long to fly

I will come as evening comes

To world of waitin' sky

Out of my dreams and into the hush

Of fallin' shadows

When the mist is low

And stars are breakin' through

Then out of my dreams I'll go

Into a dream with you...



Out of my dreams and into your arms

I long to fly

I will come as evening comes

To world of waitin' sky

Out of my dreams and into the hush

Of fallin' shadows

When the mist is low

And stars are breakin' through

Then out of my dreams I'll go

Into a dream with you...
