Lonely Room


Jud:

The floor creaks,

The door squeaks,

There's a fieldmouse a-nibblin' on a broom.

And I set by myself

Like a cobweb on a shelf,

By myself in a lonely room.



But when there's a moon in my winder

And it slants down a beam 'cros my bed

Then the shadder of a tree starts a-dancin' on the wall

And a dream starts a-dancin' in my head.

And all the things that I wish fer

Turn out like I want them to be,

And I'm better than that Smart Aleck cowhand

Who thinks he is better'n me!



And the girl I want

Ain't afraid of my arms

And her own soft arms keep me warm.

And her long, yeller hair

Falls across my face

Jist like the rain in a storm!



The floor creaks,

The door squeaks,

And the mouse starts a-nibblin' on the broom.

And the sun flicks my eyes-

It was all a pack o' lies!

I'm awake in a lonely room...



I ain't gonna dream about her arms no more!

I ain't gonna leave her alone!

Goin' outside

Git myself a bride

Git me a womern to call m

My own.
