Farmer and the Cowman


Andrew:

Oh, the farmer and the cowman should be friends,

Oh, the farmer and the cowman should be friends.

One man likes to push a plough,

The other likes to chase a cow,

But that's no reason why they cain't be friends.



Territory folks should stick together,

Territory folks should all be pals.

Cowboys dance with farmer's daughters,

Farmers dance with the ranchers' gals.



All:

Territory folks should stick together,

Territory folks should all be pals.

Cowboys dance with farmer's daughters,

Farmers dance with the ranchers' gals.



Farmer:

I'd like to say a word fer the farmer



Eller:

Well, say it!



Farmer:

He come out west and made a lot of changes



Man:

That's right!



Will:

He come out west and built a lot of fences,



Curly:

And built 'em right across our cattle ranges.



Cowboy:

Why don't you dirt strangers go back to Missouri where you belong?



Will:

We got just as much right here!



Farmer:

Shut up!

The farmer is a good and thrifty citizen

No matter what the cowman says or thinks

You seldom see 'im drinkin' in a bar room



Curly:

Unless someboy else's buyin' drinks



Andrew:

Oh, the farmer and the cowman should be friends,

Oh, the farmer and the cowman should be friends.

The cowman ropes a cow with ease,

The farmer steals her butter and cheese,

That's no reason why they cain't be friends



All:

Territory folks should stick together,

Territory folks should all be pals.

Cowboys dance with farmer's daughters,

Farmers dance with the ranchers' gals.



Eller:

I'd to say a word for the cowboy--



Curly:

You would!



Eller:

The road he treads is difficult and stoney

He rides fer days on end

With just a poney fer a friend



Annie:

I sure feelin' sorry fer the poney!



Eller:

The farmer should be sociable with the cowboy

If he rides by an' ask fer food an' water

Don't treat 'im like a louse

Make 'im welcome in your house



Ike:

But be sure that you locked up yo' wife an' daughters



Girls:

Oh, the farmer and the cowman should be friends.

Oh, the farmer and the cowman should be friends.

One man likes to push a plough,

The other likes to chase a cow,

But that's no reason why they cain't be friends.



Eller:

Ain't nobody gonna slug out anythin'. This here is a party!

Break it up ya' two ol' fools. Alright Andrew sing it!

Dum-dah-dee-um-dum-dum!



Andrew:

Oh, the farmer and the cowman should be friends,



All:

Oh, the farmer and the cowman should be friends.

One man likes to push a plough,

The other likes to chase a cow,

But that's no reason why they cain't be friends.



Curly:

And when this territory is a state

An' joins the Union jus' like all the others

The farmer, and cowman and the merchant

Mus' all behave theirselves and act like brothers



Eller:

I'd like to teach you all a little sayin'

And learn the words by heart the way you should

I don't say I'm no better than anybody else,

But I'll be damned if I ain't jist as good!



All:

I don't say I'm no better than anybody else,

But I'll be damned if I ain't jist as good!



Territory folks should stick together,

Territory folks should all be pals.

Cowboys dance with farmer's daughters,

Farmers dance with the ranchers' gals!
