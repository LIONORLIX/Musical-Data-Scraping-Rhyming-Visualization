Oklahoma!


Eller:

They couldn't pick a better time as that in life



Andrew:

It ain't too early and it ain't too late



Laurey:

Startin' as a farmer with a brand new wife



Curley:

Soon'll be livin' in a brand new state



Company:

Brand new state!

Brand new state, gonna treat you great!

Gonna give you barley, carrots and pertaters,

Pasture fer the cattle,

Spinach and termayters!

Flowers on the prarie where the June bugs zoom,

Plen'y of air and plen'y of room,

Plen'y of room to swing a rope!

Plen'y of heart and plen'y of hope.



Oklahoma, where the wind comes sweepin' down the plain

And the wavin' wheat can sure smell sweet

When the wind comes right behind the rain.

Oklahoma, Ev'ry night my honey lamb and I

Sit alone and talk and watch a hawk

Makin' lazy circles in the sky.



We know we belong to the land

And the land we belong to is grand!

And when we say

Yeeow! Ayipioeeay!

We're only sayin'

You're doin' fine, Oklahoma!

Oklahoma O.K.

Okla-okla-Okla-Okla-Okla-Okla

Okla-okla-Okla-Okla-Okla-Okla...
