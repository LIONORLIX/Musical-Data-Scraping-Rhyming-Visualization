Pore Jud Is Daid


Curly:

Pore Jud is daid,

Pore Jud Fry is daid,

All gather 'round his cawfin now and cry

He had a heart of gold

And he wasn't very old

Oh why did such a feller have to die?



Pore Jud is daid

Pore Jud Fry is daid,

He's lookin' oh so peaceful and serene



Jud: And serene!



Curly:

He's all laid out to rest

With his hands acrost his chest

His fingernails have never been so clean!



(Spoken)

Then the preacher'd get up and he'd say:



(Chanting)

Folks, we are gathered here to moan and groan over our brother Jud Fry,

who hung hisself up by a rope in his smokehouse



(Spoken)

Then there'd be weepin' and wailin'... from some of those women.  Then he'd say:



(Chanting)

Jud was the most misunderstood man in this here territory.

People used to think he was a mean ugly feller and they called

him a dirty skunk and an ornery pig stealer



(Sung)

But the folks that really knowed him.



(Chant)

Knowed that beneath them two dirty shirts he always wore



(Sung)

There beat a heart as big as all outdoors

Jud:

As big as all outdoors.

Curly:

Jud Fry loved his feller man

Jud:

He loved hes feller man



Curly (Spoken):

He loved the birds of the air and the beasts of the field.

He loved the mice and the vermin in the barns, and he treated

the rats like equals, which was right.  And he loved little children.

He loved everybody and everything in the whole world!

Only he never let on, so nobody ever knowed it.



(Sung)

Pore Jud is Daid

Pore Jud Fry is daid

His friends'll weep and wail for miles around



Jud: Miles Around!



Curly:

The daisies in the dell

will give out a different smell

Because Pore Jud is underneath the ground.



Jud:

Pore Jud is daid

A Candle lights his haid

He's layin' in a cawfin made of wood



Curly: Wood...



Jud:

And folks are feelin' sad

Cause they useter treat him bad

But now they know their friend is gone for good



Curly: Good..



Both: Pore Jud is Daid a candle lights his haid!



Curly:

He's lookin' oh so purty and so nice

He looks like he's asleep,

It's a shame that he won't keep

But it's summer and we're running out of ice.



Both: Pore Jud, Pore Jud.
