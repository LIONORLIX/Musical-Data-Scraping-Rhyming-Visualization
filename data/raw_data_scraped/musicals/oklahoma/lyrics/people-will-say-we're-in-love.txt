People Will Say We're in Love


Laurey:

Why do they think up stories that link my name with yours?



Curly:

Why do the neighbors gossip all day behind their doors?



Laurey:

I know a way to prove what they say is quite untrue

Here is the gist,

A practical list of "don'ts" fer you.

Don't throw bouquets at me

Don't please my folks to much

Don't laugh at my jokes too much.

People will say we're in love.



Curly:

Laugh at your jokes-



Laurey:

Don't sigh and gaze at me.

Your sighs are so like mine.

Your eyes mustn't glow like mine

People will say we're in love!

Don't start collecting things

Give me my rose and my glove.

Sweetheart, they're suspecting things

People will say we're in love.



Curly:

Some people claim that you are to blame as much as I

Why do you take the trouble to bake my fav'rite pie?

Grantin' your wish I carved our initials on that tree,

Just keep a slice of all the advice you give so free.

Don't praise my charm too much

Don't look so vain with me

Don't stand in the rain with me

People will say we're in love.



Don't take my arm to much

Don't keep your hand in mine

Your hand feels so grand in mine

People will say we're in love!

Don't dance all night with me

'till the stars fade from above

They'll see it's alright with me

People will say we're in love!
