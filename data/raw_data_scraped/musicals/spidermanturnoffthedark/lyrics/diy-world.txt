DIY World


(Norman and Emily)



Tell us we can be

what we wanna be



And we need to be

What we gotta be



Thats what we outta be in the DIY World



(Norman/Ensemble)



Tomorrow belongs to the brave not the slave but the brave (Tell us we can be

what we wanna be,and we need to be, what we gotta be, do it yourself,do it yourself, DIY world)





Gamma Rays

Tidal waves

Influence there's so many ways

The human race can take a hint

Wip on a zinc and you can swim

If you don't mind a little change of skin

designer jeans are a better fit



(Ensemble)



Tell us we can be

what we wanna be



And we need to be

What we gotta be



Thats what we outta be in the DIY World



(Norman/Ensemble)



Tomorrow belongs to the brave not the slave but the brave (Tell us we can be

what we wanna be,and we need to be, what we gotta be, do it yourself,do it yourself, DIY world)



(Peter)



Rising seas, no more trees (Can be a fricken fleet of killer bees)



(Norman)



We're masters of creation



(Peter and Norman)



DNA is the way



(Norman)



Now that evolution had it's day



(Peter and Norman)



Intelligence is a solition



(Norman/Ensemble)



And we, we can live for a thousand years!



Tell us we can be

what we wanna be



And we need to be

What we gotta be



Thats what we outta be in the DIY World (Do it to yourself, to yourself, do it to yourself (repeat))(Repeat)

Imagine!



We could produce super strength,

Electric Refelexes,

Powers once reserved for the ancient gods are now within our grasp!



(Ensemble)



And we, we could live (we could live) for a thousand years!
