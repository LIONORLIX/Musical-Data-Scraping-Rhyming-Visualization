Rise Above 2


When the ones who run the firehouse are the ones who start the fire

And the lawyers make the laws

And every preacher is a liar

And the ones that damn the innocent

While they own the nightly news

And front page

An old man said to me

Its not who but what you love

And knowledge isn't wisdom with our control

But still to be the changes that you want to see

They come slow

I know



And you said rise above

Open your eyes up

And you said rise above

But I can't

I can't



For every heart that bleeds

Will color your world red

And the sorrow in the night

Will be the blue you cannot shed

But your strength will be a vision

Beyond visibility

And the gift you have within

Will give you new eyes to see



And you can rise above

Swing through the skies above

And you shall rise above

Yourself



Know that I'll be watching

Know that I'll waiting

Standing on the precipice

I can't soar away from this



And you can rise above

(Free your soul)

Open your eyes up

(Rise above yourself and take control)

And you can rise above

(You need to love)

Yourself

(To release yourself and rise above it all)



And you can rise above

(I will be there)

Open your eyes up

(You were never alone)

And you can rise above

(Inside your dreams)

Yourself

(I've been watching and waiting)



And you can rise above

Open your eyes to love

And you can rise above

Yourself



And every heart that bleeds

Will color your world red

And the sorrow in the night

Will be the blue you cannot shed

And your strength will be a vision

Beyond visibility

And the gift you have before you

Will give you new eyes to see
