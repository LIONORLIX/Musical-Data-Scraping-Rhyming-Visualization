Boy Falls From The Sky


You can change your mind

But you cannot change your heart

Your heart knows what you're hiding

Your heart knows where you are



I'd be myself if I knew who I'd become

You don't have to fly too high

To get too close to the sun



See the boy fall from the sky



You will always be in front of me

Even as I disappear from view

For I have done not a single thing

Without the thought of you



But no, not here, not now, no way

I'm not ready to give up the fight

If I can use a single thread to cross the sky

Then why is the eye of the needle

Still your heart tonight



See how the boy falls from the sky



The city conducts a symphony

I'll search through the trash for a melody

That might lead us back to dignity

In this junkyard of humanity

To let you go without regret

I will forever hold you always in my heart instead

Over the screams and the siren's wail

The only thing not up for sale

Our love is like lights on a midnight train

Hearts like thunder with no sign of rain

Lightening splits the sky, kisses your face

Yours is the sacrifice, yours is the grace

I hear your voice inside my head

I wil listen to nobody, not to no one else

From the bridge where we both stood and stole the view

I saw the you in me and the me in you

These are the threads that bind

The ones we have to weave

They will hold us true, I believe

I believe

Believe, believe, believe, believe

Believe, believe, believe
