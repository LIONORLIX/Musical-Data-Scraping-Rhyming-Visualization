Rise Above 1


And you say rise above

Open your eyes up

And you say rise above

But I can't, I can't



How long will it take

Before these feelings

Go away

How much longer do I wait

And are there any real answers

Anyway



Your silence in a crowded room

Louder than the loudest tune

I hang on every word



And you say rise above

Open your eyes up

And you say rise above

But I can't, I can't



I miss you in everything

I was too fast traveling

To take you in

I know, silence is no crime

Just wish I could hear you fill it up

One more time



Yes, I know what you say to me

Exactly what you say to me

I still hang on every word



And you say rise above

Open your eyes up

And you say rise above

Yourself



In a time of treason

Is there time for trust?

Where there's no them

Only us

Is there time for reason?

Has your heart had enough

Is it time to let go

And rise above?



And you say rise above

Open your eyes to love

And you say rise above

Yourself
