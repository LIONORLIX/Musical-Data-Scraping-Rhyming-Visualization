Turn Off The Dark


Between

Regret and Despair



Between

Faith and Fear



Between

Longing and Necessity



In the Shadowland

In the Shadowland



Queen of the dark

Turn off the dark



Between

The looking and the seeing



Between

The hurting and the weeping



Between

the waking and the sleeping



Are you sleeping?

ohhh



Turn off the dark

ohhh



Turn off the dark

Turn off the dark



I've been waiting

I've been waiting



(Spoken)



I am the queen of dreams

Banished to a shadow prison

But I've watched and waited

As your powers have risen

And now my lonlieness can be undone

For the fates had delievered you my one

With me alone you have nothing to hide

Confide in me

Inside of me the universe awaits

Unwind

we'll eclipse this mortal mind

The gift you've been given binds you to me

With spider silk threads

Across the galaxy
