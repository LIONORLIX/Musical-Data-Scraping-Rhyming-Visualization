Bouncing Off The Walls


Someone else has woken up inside of me

Something has just turned on a light in me

I feel a force flow trough every artery now



I can't get down, I woke up one the roof again

Round and round, spinning on the spot again

I can't explain the who, the where, the why

Or the when, how



And I feel it in my veins

It's a feeling I can't tame

Can anyone please explain

Why, why, why



Why I'm bouncing off the walls

Bouncing off the walls

Bouncing off the walls

Bouncing off the walls



A sun spot, I'm atomic energy

The atom split but left the best part of me

It's not static just electricity

Wow, wow, wow, wow



Bouncing off the walls

Bouncing off the walls

Bouncing off the walls

Bouncing off the walls



Bouncing off the walls

Bouncing off the walls

Oh

Oh



And I feel it in my soul

What I need to control

And I feel it in my bones

Let's rock and roll

Roll, roll, roll, roll



Bouncing off the walls

Bouncing off the walls

Bouncing off the walls

Bouncing off the walls



Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, alright
