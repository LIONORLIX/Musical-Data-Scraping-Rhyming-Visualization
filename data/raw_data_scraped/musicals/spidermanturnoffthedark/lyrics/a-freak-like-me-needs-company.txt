A Freak Like Me Needs Company


If you're looking for a night out on the town

You just found me

(A freak like me needs company)

I'm a sixty five million dollar circus tragedy

(A freak like me needs company)



I'm not rolling, baby

Rolling in the green but I'm you need

(A freak)

A freak



I'm the new Coney Island

And all the rides are open and free on mee

(A freak like me needs company)



All the weirdos in the world are here right now

In New York city

All the braves and boys and girls are dressed to kill

Without pity



All the weirdos from out of town

And all the freaks always around

All the weirdos in the world are

Here in New York city

Here in New York city



I got a crew of party animal mutants by my side

(A freak like me needs company)

Demon hairdo, evil dresses, who just won't be denied

(A freak like me needs company)



The crossroads of the world does need a little tweak

From a freak

I said goodbye to my straight life 'cause I, I'm a freak

(A freak like me needs company)



All the weirdos in the world are here right now

In New York city

All the braves and boys and girls [incomprehensible]

Show no pity



All the weirdos from out of town

And all the freaks always around

All the weirdos in the world are

Here in New York city

Here in New York city



Oh yeah

That's the boys

And the ladies sing

La la la...
