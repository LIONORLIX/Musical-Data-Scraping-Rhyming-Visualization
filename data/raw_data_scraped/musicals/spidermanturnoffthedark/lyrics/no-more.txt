No More


(Peter)



Don't talk

Just walk



Going nuts

Hate my guts



Get good grades

Another shove



Stop being a loser

Stop being unloved



And why do I need these stupid glasses

I'd give my life to be



Anyone but me (yeah)

Anyone but me



I wanna be

Anyone but me (yeah)



(Mary Jane)



This isn't home just a house

Broken door broken glass



Dad'll yell

Tune him out



He's drunk by now

He has to shout



Keep on walking

Just ignore



Just get to your room

And shut the door



Let me disappear

Or just be



Anywhere but here (yeah)

Anywhere but here



I wanna be



(Peter)



Everyday it's like a war and I'm losing it

I'm taking hits from every side, every side that there is



(Mary Jane)



Evryday I feel the walls are closing in

When can I begin?



To get myself right out of this place



(Peter and Mary Jane)



Anyone but me (I count the class as it grows)

Anywhere but here (I go to sleep in my clothes)



The shoes don't fit

Not am not what I am told (where do I wake?)

Not am not what I've been sold (what do I take?)



I'm at the point of possibility (Who will I find?)

I can almost answer famility (what answers fine, when is my time?)

Not am not what I've been wrong (Is it now?)



(Peter and Mary Jane)



And I can see an open door

And I can't live like this no more



I can't live like this no more

I can't live like this no more



No no no no no no no no no no more
