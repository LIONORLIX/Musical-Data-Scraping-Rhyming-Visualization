Slide Some Oil to Me


Timan and The Dixieland Band

Slide some oil to me

Let it trickle down my spine

If you don't have S.T.P.

Crisco will do just fine



Slide some to my elbows

And to my fingers if you would

Slide some oil to me, girl

Whoo! Don't that feel good!



Slide some oil to my feet, look

I got toes again

Come on and slide some oil to my knees

And let me see if I can bend



Slide some oil to me

I'm beginning to feel just fine

Slide some oil down my throat

And let me lubricate my mind



Slide some oil to me

go ahead, hit my shoulder blades

Those who don't have to lubricate

Sure got it made

Slide some oil to me

Let it slip down my side

Laying here in one position

Sure does make me tired



Now watch me dance!



And let me lubricate my mind
