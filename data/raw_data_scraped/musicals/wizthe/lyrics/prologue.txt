Prologue


Dorothy, who lives with her Uncle Henry and Aunt Em on a farm on the bleak Kansas prairies, has spent the afternoon daydreaming and playing with her dog, Toto. Aunt Em reprimands the girl for not helping out with the chores, especially when a great storm is expected to sweep across the farm at any time. Softening when she sees how hurt Dorothy is, Aunt Em hugs Dorothy closely and expresses her love (The Feeling We Once Had). The storm has developed into a twister that hits the farm with a fury, ripping the porch from the house and taking Dorothy with it (Tornado Ballet).
