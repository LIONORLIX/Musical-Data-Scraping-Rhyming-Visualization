He's the Wizard


Miss one and the muchkins

Sweet thing,

Let me tell you 'bout

The world and the way things are.

You've come from a different place

And i know you've traveled far.

Now that you've told me what it is,

I'd better point you towards the wiz.



He's the wiz,

He's the man,

He's the only one,

Who can give your wish right to ya.

He's the wizard.

He'll send you back through time

By running magic through ya.

All of the super power's his.

Listen and i'll tell you where he is.



He's the wiz and he lives in oz.

He's the wizard.

There's the way to emerald city.

That's not too far, is it?

He's the wizard.

Just take your dilemma, child,

And lay it on the wizard.

He'll fix you a drink

That'll bubble and foam.

And in a flash

You will be home.



He's the wiz.

He's the wiz.

He's the wizard of oz.

He's got magic up his sleeve.

He's the wizard

And you know without his help,

It would be impossible to leave.

Fantastic powers at his command.

And i'm sure that he will understand.



He's the wiz and he lives in oz.



Sweet thing,

Let me tell you 'bout

The world and the way things are.

I'm gonna point you towards the wiz.



He's the wiz

Fantastic powers at his command

And i'm sure that he will understand



He's the wiz and he lives in oz



He's the wiz!
