What Would I Do If I Could Feel


Tinman and Carousel Girls

What would I do

If I could suddenly feel

And to know once again

That what I feel is real?



I could cry

I could smile

I might lay back for a while

Oh, tell me what

What would I do if I could feel?



What would I do

If I could reach inside of me

And to know how it feels

To say I like what I see?



Then I'd be more

than glad to share

All that I have inside of here

And the songs

My heart might bring

You'd be more

Than glad to sing

And if tears should fall from my eyes

Just think of all the wounds

They could mend

And just think of all the time

I could spend

Just being vuln'rable again

Oh, tell me what

What would I do?

Oh, tell me what

What would I do?

Oh, tell me what

What would I do

If I could feel?
