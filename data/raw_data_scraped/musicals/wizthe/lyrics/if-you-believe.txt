If You Believe


Dorothy

If you believe

Within your heart

You'll know that no one can change

The path that you must go

Believe what you feel

And know you're right because

The time will come around

When you'll say it's yours



Believe there's a reason to be

Believe you can make time stand still

And know from the moment you try

If you believe

I know you will

Believe in yourself right from the start

You'll have brains

You'll have a heart

You'll have courage

To last your whole life through

If you believe in yourself

If you believe in yourself

If you believe in yourself

As I believe in you



If you believe

Within your heart

You'll know that no one can change

The path that you must go

Believe what you feel

And know you're right because

The time will come around

When you'll say it's yours



Believe that you can go home

Believe you can float on air

Then click your heels three times

If you believe

Then you'll be there

That's why I want you to

Believe in yourself

Right from the start

Believe in the magic

Right there in your heart

Go ahead believe all these things

Not because I told you to

But believe in yourself

If you believe in yourself

Just believe in yourself

As I believe in you
