If You Believe (Reprise)


Glinda

If you believe

Within your heart you'll know

That no one can change

The path that you must go

Believe what you feel

And know you're right because

The time will come around

When you'll say it's yours



Believe that you can go home

Believe you can float on air

Then click your heels three times

If you believe,

Then you'll be there.



Believe in yourself

Right from the start

Believe in the magic

Right there in your heart

Go ahead believe all these things

Not because I told you to

But believe in yourself

If you believe in yourself

Just believe in yourself

As I believe in you
