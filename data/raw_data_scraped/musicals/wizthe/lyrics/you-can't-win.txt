You Can't Win


Scarecrow and Crows

You can't win

You can't break even

And you can't get out of the game

People keep sayin'

Things are gonna change

But they look just like they're staying the same

You get in

Way over your head

And you've only got yourself to blame



You can't win, chile

You can't break even

And you can't get out of the game



You can't win

The world keeps movin'

And you're standin' far behind

People keep sayin'

Things'll get better

Just to ease your state of mind

So you lay back

And you smoke that smoke

And you drink your glass of wine



You can't win, chile

You can't break even

And you can't get out of the game



You can't win

You can't win

No way if your story stays the same

You ain't winnin'

But it's nice to see you

I'm awfully glad you came

Better cool it

'Cause it ain't about losin'

Then the world has got no shame



You can't win, chile

You can't break even

And you can't get out of the game



You can't win

You can't win

You can't break even

Ain't the way

It's supposed to be

You'll be spendin'

Your little bit of money

While someone else ride free

Learn your lesson, refuel your mind

Before some turkey blows out your flame



You can't win, chile

You can't break even

And you can't get out of the game

And you can't get out of the game

And you can't get out of the game
