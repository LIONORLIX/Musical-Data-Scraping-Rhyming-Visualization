Ease On Down The Road 2


Scarecrow, Tinman and Dorothy

'Cause there maybe times

When you think you lost your mind

And the steps you're takin'

Leave you three, four steps behind

But the road you're walking

Might be long sometime,

You just keep on steppin'

And you'll just be fine!



Ease on down, ease on down the road

Ease on down, ease on down the road

Don't you carry nothin'

That might be a load.

Come on, ease on down

Ease on down the road
