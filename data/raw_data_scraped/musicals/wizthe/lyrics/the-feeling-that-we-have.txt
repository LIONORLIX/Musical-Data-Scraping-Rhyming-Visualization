The Feeling That We Have


Aunt Em and Family Choir

Put your arms around me child

Like when you bumped your shin

Then you'll know I love you now

As I loved you then

Though you maybe trying sometimes

And I'll need you

And you're not there

You know I may get mad

And turn away

But you know that I still care



But you cannot ask for more

Than can come from me

I am older than you are

And one day you'll see

If I lose my patience with you

And I suddenly start to scream

It's only because

I just want you to be

Everything that I see in my dreams



And I'd like to know it's there

The feeling that we have

When you know that you can come

Running to me

Whenever times are bad



Don't lose the feeling that we have

Don't lose the feeling that we have



Though you are growing older now

And I'm watching you grow

I know I make you sad sometimes

And I see your feeling show

But one day

I'll look around

And you will be grown

You'll be out in the world

Such a pretty girl

You'll be on your own



And I'd like to know it's there

The feeling that we have



Knowing that you can come to me

Whenever you are sad



And I'd like to know it's there

The feeling that we have



Don't lose the feeling that we have

Don't lose the feeling that we have
