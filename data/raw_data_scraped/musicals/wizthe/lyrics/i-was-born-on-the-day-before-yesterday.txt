I Was Born On The Day Before Yesterday


I was born on the day before yesterday

I had holes in my shoes, and I was crying the blues

And I didn't have a place to stay



Somehow I know

I know, i'm gonna make it this time

cause somehow i know

I know i'm gonna make it this time



I was born on a hill not so far away

Out of three rubber bands, old gloves for hands,

And a suit that had been thrown away

They took the jacket and pants

Found a brown paper bag

And they filled it with straw

And to top off the drag

They gave me penciled-in eyes

And a penciled-in nose

And they stuck me up there and said

'Strike me a pose'!!



But somehow i know, i know i'm

Gonna make it this time.

cause somehow i know

I'm gonna make it this time

(this time i'm gonna make it)

Listen to me now

(woo woo woo)

Let me sing one

(woo woo woo )

So we all can hear it

(woo woo woo )

Gonna lift my head up

(woo woo woo)

Can you feel my spirit?

Can you feel my spirit?



And now that i know

That i wasn't born yesterday

And that I'm fully grown

I can stand on my own

And nothin's gonna get in my way



Because i'm gonna get mine

I'm gonna turn things around

Gonna get myself together

Gonna get on down

And when i feel that rain come in

Through the bottom of my shoes

I'm gonna leave 'em by the roadside

And quit crying the blues



But somehow I know (i know)

I know i'm gonna make it this time

Yes, somehow i know (i know)

I know i'm gonna make it this time.



Listen to me now

(woo woo woo)

Gonna sing one,

(woo woo woo)

So you all can hear it

(woo woo woo)

Gonna lift my head up

(woo woo woo)

Can you feel my spirit?

Can you feel my spirit?
