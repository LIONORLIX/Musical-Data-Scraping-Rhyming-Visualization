Don't Nobody Bring Me No Bad News


Evilene and The Winkies

When I wake up in the afternoon

Which it pleases me to do

Don't nobody bring me no bad news

'Cause I wake up already negative

And I've wired up my fuse

So don't nobody bring me no bad news



If we're going to be buddies

Better bone up on the rules

'Cause don't nobody bring me no bad news

You can be my best of friends

As opposed to payin' dues

But don't nobody bring me no bad news



No bad news

No bad news

Don't you ever bring me no bad news

'Cause I'll make you an offer, child

That you cannot refuse

So don't nobody bring me no bad news



When you're talking to me

Don't be cryin' the blues

'Cause don't nobody bring me no bad news

You can verbalize and vocalize

But just bring me the clues

But don't nobody bring me no bad news



Bring some message in your head

Or in something you can't lose

But don't you ever bring me no bad news

I'f you're gonna bring me something

Bring me, something I can use

But don't you bring me no bad news
