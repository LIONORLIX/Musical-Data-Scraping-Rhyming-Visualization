Who Do You Think You Are?


Who,

Who do you think you are?

Tell me how,

How did you go so far?



The show is over,

The curtain is down,

And you got to come clean!



The time is now!

You just messed up!

And say what ya mean!



Maybe your,

You came off as much too cool!



Tell me who!

Who did ya think you fool?



You turn us on,

And you turned us off!

Baby your life for real!



We see you now,

For what you are!

Tell me how does it feel?

How does it feel?!



Who?

Who do ya think you are?

Who told you?

Told you that you're the star!



The gig is over!

You've got to come through,

We gotta get over!

So watch you come at you!



Who'd you think you are?

(Who do you think you are?)

Who'd you think you are?

(Who do you think you are?)

Who'd you think you are?

(Who do you think you are?)

Who'd you think you are?

Who'd you think you are?

Who'd you think you are?

Who'd you think you are?????
