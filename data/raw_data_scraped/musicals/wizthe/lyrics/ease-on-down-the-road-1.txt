Ease on Down the Road 1


Scarecrow and Dorothy

Come on and

Ease on down, ease on down the Road!

Come on, ease on down

Ease on down the road

Don't you carry nothing

That might be a load

Come on, ease on down...ease on down the road!



Pick your left foot up

When your right one's down,

Come on legs keep movin'

Don't you lose no ground

You just keep on keepin'

On the road that you choose;

Don't you give up walkin'

'Cause you gave up shoes...



Ease on down, ease on down the road

Come on, ease on down

Ease on down the road

Don't you carry nothing

That might be a load,

Come on...

Ease on down,

Ease on down the road

Ease...On...Down,

Ease...On...Down,

Ease on down, ease on down the road!
