Y'all Got It!


Y'ALL GOT IT!

(The Wiz ? Broadway)



[The Wiz]

I got to leave

So I packed my bags

And I'm goin'



I gotta date

So don't you ask me to stay

Cause I'm showin'



You were always ready

For new wizardry

Musta thought that miracles

Came easy to me!



Here's what I'll give you

And put it up on the shelf

Cause now it's time for this here wiz

To wiz on himself!

And I'm wizzin'



Give me a reason why I should stay

And I'll judge it.

My, my, my, My mind is made up

And nothin' you say's gonna budge it.



Y'all copped a whole lotta magic from me

But here's the greatest magic

That you'll ever see



If you blink more than one time

The kid will be gone

And you will have to hook up

The rest on your own

And you know what I think about that?



Your work's cut out for you

It's not about Ifs, Buts, or Ands

Cause when I leave this job

I'm leavin' it all in your hands



I packed up my clothes

And I packed up my power

I'm leavin' this place

In less than one half an hour



If you look up in the sky

You'll know just who it is

It's not a bird, it's not a plane

It's just the little ole' Wiz!

And guess who it's on after that?



[Citizens of Oz]

Y'all got it

Y'all got it

Y'all got it



[The Wiz]

I'm talkin' bout leavin' here



(Repeat 2x)
