Mortals and Fools


[Rem: Verse 1]

What I see in your eyes

Is a counterfeit emotion

Nearly true, pretty lies

Promise all you're dreaming of



Like a frog in a well

Who is sure he's in the ocean

You believe in the spell

Of this thing that you call love



[Chorus]

Try as I will, I just don't understand it

Love is for mortals and fools

Never turns out quite the way that you planned it

So why do you break all the rules?



[Verse 2: Misa]

What I feel is so real

That it sets my poor heart racing

Something you'll never know

Though you live a thousand years



[Rem]

Half a life

Is the deal to discover who you're chasing

Half a life



[Misa]

Even so, worth it all if he appears



[Rem, Misa: Chorus]

Try as you might, you will not understand it

[Rem]

Love is for mortals and fools

[Rem, Misa]

Never turns out quite the way that you planned it

[Misa]

Love makes you break all the rules



[Misa: Bridge]

Love can make you come alive



[Rem]

Or take your life away

Love should make you leave



[Misa]

But makes you stay

For love can make you happy

In a house where love is made



[Rem]

Then it makes you wary and afraid



[Rem: Chorus]

Try as I might, never will understand it

Love is for mortals and fools

Never turns out quite the way that you planned it



[Misa]

Love is for making



[Rem]

Life is for taking



[Rem, Misa]

Love makes you break all the rules

Love makes you break all the rules
