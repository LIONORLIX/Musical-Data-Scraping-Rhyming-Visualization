Honor Bound


[Soichiro]

Any grounds for L's suspicion surely lie with me

I must catch this monster Kira so the world can see

My son is exactly who he seems to be

Honor bound and bound by honesty



Accusations, innuendos, theories full of cracks

Timelines and coincidences can't replace hard facts

But if what I'm seeing, bends as light reflects

Am I blinded to what my son lacks?



If I thought these lies were true

Would I have the strength to do

Anything I need to do

For justice's sake?



Could I stand the pain and lies

If it's Kira that I find

Behind Light's eyes?



Listen to me, am I crazy?

Thinking he could be

Some insane, unfeeling monster somehow raised by me



Must come to my senses and my sanity

Let me see the son I need to see

Honor bound and bound by honesty

Honor bound to serve his family
