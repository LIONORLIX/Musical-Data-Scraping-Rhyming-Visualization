Stalemate


[L: Verse 1]

Each time I challenge he responds

He takes the bait as if he's taunting me

He waves a hundred magic wands

And soon a hundred men just cease to be



I haven't figured out just how

He doesn't kill them with a knife or gun

But if you ask me here and now

I'm pretty sure Kira is your son



[Light: Verse 2]

I wonder if this guy's for real

I wonder is he who he claims to be

And if he is, then what's the deal?

Why would he make a point of telling me?



[L]

He doesn't rattle easily

He's such a calm and cool collected guy

And if he kills while he's with me

Like it or not, I have his alibi



[L, Light: Chorus]

All or nothing so let's get to it

This time's stalemate but

Just you wait

Clock is ticking so

Let's just do it

Let's begin, thick or thin, lose or win

This is it!



[Light: Verse 3]

His name is obviously fake

So he inoculates himself from me

He's waiting for my first mistake

So I'll wait also but more patiently



[L]

Just like two actors on a stage

Go through the motions that we both rehearse

Our little new atomic age

Eyeball to eyeball

We'll see who blinks first



[L, Light: Chorus]

All or nothing so let's get to it

This time's stalemate but

Just you wait

Clock is ticking so

Let's just do it

No taboos, light the fuse, win or lose

This is it!



[Misa: Bridge]

I know you're gonna love my brand new song

It's full of private, little, hidden clues

So we can find each other in a crowd

And when we do, you know I'm yours to use



I feel like we were born for just one thing

I know we're gonna be a perfect fit

You'll be my heart and I'll be your eyes

It's me and you forever

This is it!



[L, Light: Chorus]

All or nothing so let's get to it

This time's stalemate but

Just you wait

Clock is ticking so

Let's just do it



[L]

Let's begin!



[Light]

Light the fuse!



[L]

Go all in!



[Light]

Win or lose



[L]

Lose or win



[L, Light]

This is it!
