Kira


[Ryuk: Verse 1]

Where I come from is a world of bone and dust

No need to change, or readjust;

Where the plight of human beings is ignored

And all I am, is always bored;



So from time to time I visit

Seeking fun and self defense;

Its no big deal, really, is it?

And of no consequence;



[Chorus]

Except for Kira, Kira

Your brand new name;

The masses cheering, Kira

Don’t know it's Light Yagami, playing his dangerous game;



[Verse 2]

Shinigami sit and gamble all day long

It isn't right, it isn't wrong

For there really isn't very much to do

So now and then, we spy on you;



Humans are such funny creatures

Always thinking you're so smart;

So we look down from our bleachers

While you tear things apart;



Except for Kira, Kira

Your brand new name;

The masses cheering, Kira

Don’t know he’s Light Yagami, playing his dangerous game;



[Bridge]

The more things change they say that

The more they stay the same;

You think you’re making changes

But the only thing you can change is your name;



[Chorus]

Because its Kira, Kira

Whose justice is rigged;

Because its Kira, Kira

Who makes a list of people

Whose names he’ll write down and—

Oh look, now there's an apple

Mind if I just take a bite?
