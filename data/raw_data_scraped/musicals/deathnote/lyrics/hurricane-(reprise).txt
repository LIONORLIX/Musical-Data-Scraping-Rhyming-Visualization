Hurricane (Reprise)


(As LIGHT talks to HALEY BELLE, a woman's chanting of Kira can be heard for four times as he announces his plan to murder Belle. A clock is ticking in the background.)



[Light]

I'll bring the rain

I'll bring the wind

I am the mighty hurricane



The human stains

And all their sins

Blown away



I'll bring the pain

So be afraid

I will bring the power of the hurricane



(As LIGHT finishes his line, lights flicker. Train movements are heard. ENSEMBLE chants 'Kira' for 8 times. LIGHT laughs, as the scene segues into a different one.)
