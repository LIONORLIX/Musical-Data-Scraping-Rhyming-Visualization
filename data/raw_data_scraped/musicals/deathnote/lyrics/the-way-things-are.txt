The Way Things Are


[L]

Every fact that I thought I knew

Is subverting me

Deserting me

Every truth I was sure was true

Is on shaky ground

Has come unwound



What if the things I see

Are not as they appear

Are impossible, yet clear

How can I deny it?



Always only believed what was

Right in front of me

What I could see

Shinigami are real because

It's the only way

The only way



When all other explanations

Really don't explain

No matter how insane

You are left with only



The cold, hard truth

Can't shut it down

You can't change it

You can't turn it off

Or turn it 'round

Can't rearrange it



The cold, hard truth

A ragged scar

To remind you never forget

The way things are



I won't let who I used to be

How I used to think

Get me out of sync

I'll turn into a different me

Not so cynical

Not so clinical



Light is willing to risk it all

Defying all the odds

If I must, I'll fight the gods

'Til our war is over



The cold, hard truth

Can't lock it out

You can't change it

True or false, no

Shadow of a doubt

Can't rearrange it



The cold, hard truth

Is my north star

So I know I'll live and I'll die

The way things are



Frame by frame

I see this movie in black and white

Shot by shot

Minute by minute, just me and Light



The cold, hard truth

The way things are

I can't change it

Even if the truth

Seems too bizarre

I can't change it



The cold, hard truth

Is my north star

So no matter what he might try

Shake the heavens

Shatter the sky

I know we must both live and die

The way things are
