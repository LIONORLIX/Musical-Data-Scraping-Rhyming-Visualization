When Love Comes


[Rem: Verse 1]

Oooooooh

People have always talked about it, I have always lived without it

Never understood its magic spell

It can take your breath away

So that's what the poets say

Guess they ought to know but who can tell?

Never believed that anything could feel this true

Don't see it coming till its standing right in front of you



[Chorus]

When love comes, it takes you by surprise

You see things through someone else's eyes

When love comes, you will never be the same

It scares you, still you hope it stays forever

When love comes



[Verse 2]

Finally there's someone to cry for

Someone I would gladly die for

Someone who is all the way alive

Can't believe the peace I'm feeling

Almost like it can't be real

Even if I die, love will survive

Funny the things the human heart will put you through

Don't see it coming till its standing right in front of you



When love comes

It catches you off-guard, so easy

Don't notice it's alive

When love comes, it happens way too fast

You hope you make the moment last forever

When love comes



[Bridge]

You are the only part of me I'm certain will live on

All I ask of you is to remember love is never gone



[Chorus]

When love comes

Don't let it slip away!

Just hold on and treasure it everyday

When love comes

It struggles to belong

Don't fight it

Share a kiss and then surrender

When love comes
