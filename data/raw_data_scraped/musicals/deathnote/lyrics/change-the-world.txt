Change the World


[Light]

It's gotta be a joke, of course

Some fed-up cop who left the force

Or some civilian psychopath

Whose righteous wrath may be the source



(dialogue interlude)



But what would happen if it's true?

Imagine all that I could do

For with such power, I could change

And rearrange the world anew



(dialogue interlude)



If there's the slightest chance it's true

I'll write his name, what else can I do?



[Chorus (spoken)]

Forty...

Thirty-nine...

Thirty-eight...



[Light]

Now maybe justice sure and swift

Will become my clear-cut gift

To a system ripe for saving



Now let the Death Note play its part

And become a work of art

For the justice we're all craving



[Chorus (spoken)]

Four...

Three...

Two...

One...
