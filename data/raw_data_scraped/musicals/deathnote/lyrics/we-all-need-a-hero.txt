We All Need a Hero


[Sayu: Verse 1]

When I get afraid, and all hope is gone

I reach for your hand and I belong

Cause someone like you, who's scared but won't run

Is standing his ground for everyone



[Pre-Chorus]

Because the best of us can come from anyplace

Helping the rest face what we must face



[Chorus]

We all need a hero

Somebody to help us to be brave

We all need a hero

Someone he can save

We all need a hero

Believing that deep inside

We'll find there's some kind of hero too

Like the one I found in you



[Verse 2]

And so win or lose

We fight the good fight

As long as you try with all your might



A heart that is strong

A heart that is true

A heart that will risk it all to do



[Pre-Chorus]

And whatever he can do when something must be done

Showing us we can do the same thing, one by one



[Chorus]

We all need a hero

To rush in and try to save the day

We all need a hero

For dragons yet to slay

We all need a hero

To show us that deep inside

We'll find there's some kind of hero too

Like the one I found in you



[Bridge]

A dreamer chasing dreams

A light that's always burning bright

Chasing the dark from the night



[Chorus]

We all need a hero

Somebody to help us to be brave

We all need a hero

And causes lost to save

We all need a hero

Believing that deep inside

We'll find there's some kind of hero too

Like the one I found in you

Like the one I found in you
