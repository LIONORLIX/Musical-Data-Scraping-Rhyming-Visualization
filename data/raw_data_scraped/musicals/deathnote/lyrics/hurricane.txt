Hurricane


[Light: Verse 1]

Did I hear correctly?

Did it really happen?

Was it simply done by writing down his name?



Killing indirectly

Pen and ink and paper

Writing is the gun, I only have to aim



Could this be the hour?

Unimagined power

Waiting to devour who I say?



[Chorus]

The hardest rains

The coldest winds

Are waiting for the hurricane



The human stains

And all their sins

Blown away



The earth will shake

The sky will scream

Once they feel the power of the hurricane



[Verse 2]

Finally a chance to

Find a little justice

There's nowhere to run to once the name is penned



Take what fortune grants you

Use it while you've got it

Once you have begun you write it to the end



Elegant solution

Flawless execution

Righteous retribution on the way



[Chorus]

I'll bring the rain

I'll bring the wind

I am the mighty hurricane



The human stains

And all their sins

Blown away



I'll bring the pain

So be afraid

I will bring the power of the hurricane



I am the God of a brave new world

Much better than the last

The time for talking is finally in the past



[Chorus]

The hardest rains

The coldest winds

Are waiting for the hurricane



The human stains

And all their sins

Blown away



The hardest rains

The coldest winds

Are waiting for the hurricane



The human stains

And all their sins

Blown away



The earth will shake

The sky will scream

Once they feel the power of the hurricane!
