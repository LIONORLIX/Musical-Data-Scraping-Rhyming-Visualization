Playing His Game


[Light: Verse 1]

Time to rethink

And begin

With a brand new game plan

Margin for error is slim



[L]

He’s on the brink

He can win

I can’t use the same plan

Time to start thinking like him



[Light: Pre-Chorus]

What would I do if I got inside his head?

[L]

Thought like him instead?

[Light]

Could it be

[L]

Possibly



[Light, L]

I’ll catch him when

I look through his eyes

See what he sees

And then improvise

Until I can learn what puts him at ease

I’ll walk in his shoes

As long as it takes

Till deep in my bones

I’m sure he’s

One and the same as the me who is playing his game



[Light: Verse 2]

What does he do

Late at night

When the world is sleeping

Does he see pixels, not dreams



[L]

Hard to be true

Always right

All that promise keeping

Harder I’m sure than it seems



[Light: Pre-Chorus]

How would it be if I saw the world like him?

[L]

Like a synonym

[Light]

Bit by bit

[L]

Wit by wit



[Light, L: Chorus]

Catch him, I win

I’ll mimic his will

And learn his routines

And feel the same thrill

Whenever my end is served by his means

I’ll walk in his shoes

As long as it takes

Till deep in my bones

I’m sure he is

One and the same as the me who is playing his game



[L: Bridge]

Steady

I must be ever so careful

Don’t move until you are ready

He will be careful too



[Light]

Know it

Always stay calm and collected

Don’t lose your cool or you’ll blow it

Then he will unravel you



[Light & L: Chorus]

Get into his head

And under his skin

The things that he said

The food that he likes

The places he’s been

I’ll look through his eyes

And see what he sees

Till I see the forest, not just the trees

I’ll mimic his will

And learn his routines

And feel the same thrill and know what it means

I’ll walk in his shoes

As long as it takes

Till deep in my bones I’m sure

I’m winning my game while I’m saying

I’m playing his game
