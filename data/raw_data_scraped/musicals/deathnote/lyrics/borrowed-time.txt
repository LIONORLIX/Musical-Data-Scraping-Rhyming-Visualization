Borrowed Time


[Misa: Verse 1]

You can tie me up and you can hold me down and

You can ask me questions and try to turn me round and

Take me to the edge and push me off a ledge and

You can do most anything you want to do to me now



But you will never change my mind

No, no, no!



[Chorus]

So tie me up and try to break me

You will never change my mind

I'd rather die then let you make me betray him

The years roll on with or without me

I'm already gone cause I'm living on borrowed time



[Verse 2]

You can try to trick me into what you're seekin'

Give me drugs and make me start to crack and weaken

You can tell me lies and you can blind my eyes and

You can do your best to do you worst and get in my head



But I will hold on longer than you

No, no, no!



[Chorus]

So you can tie me up and try to break me

You will never change my heart

I'd rather die than let you make me betray him!

The years roll on with or without me

I'm already gone cause I'm living on borrowed time



[Bridge]

I'm cheating death with every breath

And every song and every sigh

With every day that I don't die

Is borrowed time!



[Chorus]

So tie me up and try to break me

You will never change my heart

I'd rather die than let you make me betray him!

The years roll on with or without me

I'm already gone cause I'm living

Oh yes, I'm living

On borrowed time!
