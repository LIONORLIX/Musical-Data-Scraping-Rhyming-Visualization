Let Me Come Home


Linda:

I know i kind ok went out with a bang

When i dumped you out of the blue

But my heart's just like a boomerang

It came right back to you



Now i'm confessin'

I've learned my lesson

Give me your blessin'

To come back home

Here's what i'm trying to say



Let me come home to you baby

Let me come home

Let me come home to you baby

Let me come home



Robbie:

I don't wanna be alone anymore...



Linda:

You don't have to be, baby...



Now i could try and date some glamorous guy

And things might turn out cool

But as i learned when i applied to devry

You gotta have a safety school



Now you're my back-up

Don't make me pack-up

And have to shack up

Cdown by the interstate

Yeah, i'll reiterate



Let me come home to you baby

Let me come home

Let me come home to you baby

Let me come home



And tomorrow when you wake up

You'll no longer have an ex

Cause the best part of a break-up

Is the make-up sex



Let me come home to you baby

Let me come home

Let me come home to you baby

Let me come home



Let me come home to you baby

Let me come home

Let me come

Let me come

Let me come home
