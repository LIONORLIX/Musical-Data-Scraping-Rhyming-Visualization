Somebody Kill Me


Robbie

You don't know how much i need you

While you're near me i don't feel blue

And when we kiss i know you reed me, too

I can't believe i found a love that's so pure and true



But it all was bullshit

It was a goddamn joke

And when i think of you linda

I hope you fucking choke



I hope you're glad with what you've done to me

I lay in bed all day long feeling melancholy

You left me here all alone tears running constantly



Oh, somebody kill me please

Somebody kill me please

I'm on my knees

Pretty, pretty please kill me

I want to die

Put a bullet to my head
