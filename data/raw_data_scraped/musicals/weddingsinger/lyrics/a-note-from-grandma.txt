A Note From Grandma


Linda

To my dearest robbie

I think we need some space

Please forgive my timing

Dot dot dot, smiley face



I woke up this morning

Prepared to walk on air

Then realized that you've cramped my style

As i cramped my hair

You're just not that same person

They guy i used to know

I'm not in love with robbie now

But robbie seven years ago



You should have been in motley crew

Or david lee roth's replacement

But instead you sing while people chew

And you live in your grandma's basement



I hope this note is something

That you can rise above

Deep down you weren't in love with me

You were just in love with love

And so it's best we end this

Before we even start



Signed, your pal

Linda

The "i" is dotted

With a broken heart
