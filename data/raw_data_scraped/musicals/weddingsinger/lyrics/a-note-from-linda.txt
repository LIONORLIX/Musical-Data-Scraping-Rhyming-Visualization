A Note From Linda


Linda:



To my dearest Robbie,

I think we need some space.

Please excuse my timing

dot-dot-dot, smiley face.



You see, I woke this morning,

prepared to walk on air.

But realized that you cramped my style,

as I crimped my hair.



You're just not that same person,

the guy I used to know.

I'm not in love with "Robbie Now"

but "Robbie Seven Years Ago"



You could have been in Motely Crue

or David Lee Roth's replacement.

But instead you sing while people chew.

And you live in your grandma's basement!



I hope this note is something

that you can rise above.

Deep down you weren't in love with me,

you were just in love with love.



And so it's best we end this

before we even start.

Signed your pal Linda.

The "i" is dotted with a broken heart.
