Come Out of the Dumpster


Julia

So tonight you made some mistakes

I admit it, you hit a few bumps

But i hate to see you like this

Down on your luck, down in the dumps



Though hope may seem in short supply

You have to move on

You have to try



So come out of the dumpster

Don't leave me standing here

Come out of the dumpster

Its ok; the coast is clear



The cop cars are leaving

Channel 5 packed up its crew

So come out of the dumpster

I'll be right here waiting for you



Robbie (spoken)

Ok. I'll try



Julia (spoken)

All right!



(robbie trys to climb out of the dumpster, but falls back in)



Julia (sung)

So you're back in the dumpster

Well, thats like a metaphor

Everyone has a dumpster

A stumbling block you can't ignore



But to fight it makes you stronger

And someday you might stand!

So come out of that dumpster

Here, take a hold of my hand



So your first day back wasn't all you anticipated



Robbie (sung)

I bit the best man

The bride had to be sedated



Julia

But this sort of thing happens all the time

When life gives you garbage

You it to climb!



(robbie climbs out)



Look!

You're out of the dumpster

Now, was that so hard after all?

It was only a dumpster



Robbie

And from here, it looks so small



Julia

Now you're back where you started

On you're way to success

So...

Will you play at my wedding?



Robbie

No!
