It's Your Wedding Day


Robbie

I wrote a song six years ago

While playing in a wedding band

The word got out and suddenly

The band and i are in demand

And now couples all over jersey

Hire me to insure their wedded bliss

All because of a tune i wrote

That tune

Goes like this:

Oh, when it's your wedding day

And my music starts to play

I can guarantee that



All

Love will find you!



Robbie

Yeah, when it's your wedding day

All the problems melt away

If you count on me

'Cause love is what i do

Now when we play a wedding gig



Robbie, sammy & george

We're like a finely tuned machine



Robbie

Sammy does van halen licks

While george gets down on tambourine

We might play you some careless whisper



Sammy & george

Or make you wish you had



All

Jessie's girl instead



Sammy & george

Bring the room down with endless love



Robbie

The blast bang your head



All

Bang your head!



Robbie, sammy & george

So when it's your wedding day

And my music starts to play

I can guarantee that



All

Love will find you!



Robbie, sammy & george

So when it's your wedding day

All the problems melt away

If you count on me

'Cause love is what i do



Robbie

Long before the night is through

Your uncle will be my uncle, too

I'll be so tight with your cousin steve

He'll invite me over for christmas eve

I'll dance your mom all around the room

Then present the bride and groom



(dance break.)



Robbie (spoken)

Line dance, follow me!



Robbie & ensemble

So when it's your wedding day

And my music starts to play

Love will find you

Yeah, when it's your wedding day

All the problems melt away



Robbie

If you count on me



All

Cause love is what



Robbie

Yes, love is what i do



Ensemble

Do, do, do, do, do, do, do

Do, do, do, do, do, do, do

Do, do, do, do, do, do, do



All

Love is what i do!
