Saturday Night in the City


Holly

When the weekend rolls around i hound the hottest spots

My favorite club'll

Always double

All my vodka shots

Got my skin tight bustier and plastic crucifix

Tonight we're gonna party like its 1986!



Cause it's saturday night

Saturday night

Saturday night in the city



All

It's saturday night

Saturday night

Saturday night in the city



Holly

One you're past the velvet ropes your wildest dreams come true



Julia

The dance floor smoke



Glen

A bump of coke



George

And everything taboo



Robbie

I got a pair a'parachute pants that grandma got me to wear



Sammy

Can't wait till chicks start flocking to my flock of seagulls hair



All

New york is reserved for the rich proud

But here comes the bridge and tunnel crowd



All

And it's saturday night

Saturday night

Saturday night in the city



It's saturday night

Saturday night

Saturday night in the city



Guys

Out on the prowl



Girls

And dressed impress



All

Hoping sunday morning you'll have sins to confess



Goths, punks, and posers

And yuppie snobs galore

Everybody's equal when they're thrashing on the floor



Cause it's saturday night

Saturday night

Saturday night in the city



It's saturday night

Saturday night

Saturday night in the city



Glen

Look at the wedding singer go! Holly is gonna rock his world tonight!



Julia

Wow, she's kinda into him.



Glen

Anything wrong, baby?



Julia

Why would anything be wrong? Let's get drunk!



All

Whoa, whoa

Saturday night in the city



Julia

Hey, glen and i got engaged!



Robbie

Yeah, you told us that.

(to glen) is she okay?

She seems a little tipsy...



Julia

I'm not tipsy!

(loud whisper to glen)

I'm hammered!



Glen

Okay, baby, time to go home.

(glen helps steer julia off)



Robbie

Maybe i should go help glen.



Holly

Forget him! Forget everybody!



Check out the view

You'll like what you see

My body's an amusement park, the first ride's on me



Don't stop to question

If you're gonna score

Being young and stupid is what saturday is for



All

It's what saturday is for!



And it's saturday night night

Saturday night

Saturday night in the city



It's saturday night

Saturday night

Saturday night in the city

(holly kisses robbie)



Holly

That wasn't anything like that kiss you gave julia.



Robbie

Holly...



Holly

I can't believe i never noticed it.



Robbie

What?



Holly

You have a thing for julia.



Robbie

No, i don't.



Holly

(gently) robbie. She's marrying glen.

(glen and julia appear outside the club.)



Glen

I told you some air would make you feel better.



Julia

You are, like, so awesome. And your hair is... So hard.



Glen

Uh-huh. The valet's pulling the car around. We'll get you home and in bed.

(the delorean appears. Julia and glen drive off.)



Robbie

Tell the night to save it's moonlight

Tell the birds not to sing

Tell yourself that you must have been out of your mind

Cause it's night that kind

No it's not that kind of thing



Holly

Saturday night in the city

(holly pulls a chain and is doused with water, a la "flashdance".)



All

Saturday night

Saturday night

Saturday night in the city



It's saturday night

Saturday night

Saturday night in the city!
