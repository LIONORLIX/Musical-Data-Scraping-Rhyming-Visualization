Move That Thang


George

(spoken)

Mrs. Hart, um, it seems we've lost half our band for the party. This is awkward.



Rosie

George, i think i can come up with something. Gimme a beat!



(rap)

Well, first things first, my name is rose

I can bust fly rhymes just like the pros

I ain't got time for tea and scones

Forget rockin' chairs, i rock microphones



The roof

The roof

The roof might have snow

But that don't mean there ain't a fire burning down below



George

(sung)

Cause it's never too late



Rosie

(rap)

All my homies say



George

(sung)

Never too late, ya'll



Rosie

(rap)

All the ladies say



George

(sung)

Never too late



Rosie

(rap)

Everybody say



Rosie & george

(sung)

Never too late to move that thang



(rap)

George

Will you stand like a fool, just blinkin' and shruggin'

Scared to say the truth cause you might start buggin'?



Rosie

Not the "r" to the "o" to the "s" to the "e"

Do you feel me, boo?



George

Indubitably



When fear says our dreams might not fulfill us

Just reply:



Rosie

Whachu talkin' 'bout, willis?



George

So you're saying to take each snag in stride

And just pass the dutchie on the left hand side?



Rosie

Keep it cool and you won't start illin'



George

I know you're not illin'



Rosie

I'm chillin' like a villain



George

(sung)

Cause it's never too late



Rosie

(rap)

All my homies say



George

(sung)

Never too late, ya'll



Rosie

(rap)

All the ladies say



George

(sung)

Never too late



Rosie

(rap)

Everybody say



Rosie & george

(sung)

Never too late to move that thang



George

Never too late



Rosie

Move that thang



George

Never too late



Rosie

Move that thang



George

Never too late



Rosie & george

Never too late to move that thang



George

(rap)

Word to your grandmother!
