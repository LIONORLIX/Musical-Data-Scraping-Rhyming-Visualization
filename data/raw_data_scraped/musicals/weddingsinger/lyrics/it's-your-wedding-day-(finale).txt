It's Your Wedding Day (Finale)


[sammy]

He wrote a song six years ago while playing in a wedding band



[george]

The word got out and suddenly his band was super in demand



[impersonator 0]

People call him the wedding singer

He sang at weddings and soon the name was out



[holly]

But he got dumped by his fiance and then...

He just snapped

He just snapped

He just snapped

He just snapped

He just snapped



[impersonator 1]

He met a girl named julia

Who saved him from his tale of woe



[impersonator 2]

*speaks phillipino*



[sammy]

For those of you who speak phillipino you know that things ended up the way they should



[impersonator 3]

Thats the way that the story ends



[rosie]

[impersonator 3]

[master of ceremony]

Ladies and gentlemen, mr. and mrs. Robbie Hart!



[robbie and julia]

If I told you what i'm feeling now inside

Youd be certain theres not a single thing that we should hide

If I hold you...theres one problem you should know...

If I hold you... I might not ever let you go



*all*

Never let you go...

Never let you go...



[robbie]

So when its your wedding day

And my music starts to play
