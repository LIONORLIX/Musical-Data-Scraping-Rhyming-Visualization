Right in Front of Your Eyes


Holly

Everytime you see his face you get annoyed,

And if ignorance is bliss, he's overjoyed.

And can we talk about that stuff he calls his hair?

But what would happen if one day he wasn't there?



Caught by surprise,

Could you wake up one day and realize

The one that you want is right in front of your eyes?



Every night a hundred guys come through the door.

They take your breath away each time they take the floor.

And they've got the bucks, the tux, the killer face,

But you're still thinking of that jackass with a face.



You're caught by surprise.

Could you wake up one day and realize

That the one that you want is right in front of your eyes?



You might have a champagne wish or two,

Plus a caviar dream.

But are the lifestyles of the rich and famous

Really all they seem?

The one that you want's right in front of your eyes.



Holly

You're caught by surprise.

Could you wake up one day and realize

That the one that you want,

The one that you want,

The one that you want

Is right in front of your eyes?
