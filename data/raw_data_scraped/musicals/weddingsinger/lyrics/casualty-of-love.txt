Casualty of Love


Robbie

I thought i had the kind of love

You find in fairy tales

But then my girl ripped out my heart

With her plastic press-on nails

So if you know the kind of pain

This looser's singin' of

Well, let me hear you say it

I'm a casualty of love

Just a casualty of love



Sideburns girl

I'm a casulaty of love!



Robbie

Tell me about it!



Sideburns girl

I put a top hat on my cat, and i asked him to the prom



Nerd

I was stood up by my date, and by date i mean my mom



Fat lady

Each night i open up my mouth and give those twinkies a shove



Robbie

Well i know why you do it

You're a casualty of love



Loosers

I'm a casualty of love



Robbie

Just a casualty of love



Loosers

A casualty of



All

Love



Robbie

We're from different walks of life

And different points of view

But we come together now



All

Through our hatred of you!

Cause we're casualties of love



Robbie

Love's a trick, love's a trap

Love's a hot chick with the clap

Love's a hoax, love's a tease

A pinata full of bees

Love's a joke, love's a scam

A sargent slaughter body slam

Love's a wound, watch it bleed

Love's the only thing i...



You'll end up just like us

Cause, trust me, love always ends

You'll be fat, divorced, and broke

While she has sex with all of your friends



Robbie and loosers

You'll be casualties of love

Love's a trick, love's a trap

Love's a hot chick with the clap

Love's a wound, watch it bleed

Love's the only thing i need

I need



Robbie

No one's ever gonna love

A casualty of love
