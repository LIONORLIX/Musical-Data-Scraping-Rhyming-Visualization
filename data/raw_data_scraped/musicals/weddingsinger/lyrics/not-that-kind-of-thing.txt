Not That Kind of Thing


Clerk [Spoken]:

Now, kids, couples always argue when they come here to register.

My advice is, be very careful..



Clerk:

It's a situation

first fight.

I've seen couples face disaster.



Why not tell yourselves

you're both wrong,

both right.

It means that you'll make up faster.



Robbie:

I hate to tell you but we're not with each other.

We're sister and brother.



Julia:

And he's the slow one.



Robbie:

She's an idiot according to mother.



Julia:

It takes one to know one.



Robbie & Julia:

Tell the night

to save it's moonlight.

Tell the birds

not to sing.

Tell the stars

in the heavens they've been misaligned.

'Cause it's not that kind of thing.



Crystal [Spoken]:

Look, a sale on towels!

Hold my purse for me.



Mookie [Spoken]:

Baby, please. No.



Crystal [Spoken]:

I said hold it!



(Crystal holds out her purse. Mookie takes it sheepishly.)



(Julia holds out her purse.)



Julia [Spoken]:

Um, Robbie? Hold my purse?



Robbie [Spoken]:

No.



Julia [Spoken]:

I said hold it!



Crystal:

You get stuck with them for better,



Julia:

or worse.



Julia & Crystal:

No matter which way you stack it.



Robbie & Mookie:

It's emasculating holding a purse.



Robbie:

And it doesn't match my jacket.



Your evil scheme has worked out just as you planned it,

I now understand it.



Julia:

I shop, you carry.



Robbie:

I do the work and you make out like a bandit.



Julia:

It's true.



Robbie [Spoken]:

No. It's scary.



Julia [Spoken]:

No. You're scary!



Robbie [Spoken]:

You're scary!



Robbie & Julia & Ensemble:

Tell the night

to save it's moonlight.

Tell the birds

not to sing.

Tell the stars in the heavens they've been misaligned.

'Cause it's not that kind of thing.



Robbie:

True, there are times

when her eyes meet mine and linger there.

Maybe a bit too long.



Julia:

And I wonder,

is there something hidden in his stare.



Robbie & Julia:

No, I couldn't be more wrong.



All:

Tell the night

to save it's moonlight.

Tell the birds

not to sing.

Tell the stars in the heavens they've been misaligned.

'Cause it's not that kind.

No it's not that kind.

No it's not that kind of thing.



Julia [Spoken]:

Oh my God, Robbie.

That's the dress. That's the dress I was meant to get married in!

You think I'll look all right?



Robbie [Spoken]:

You'll look beautiful.
