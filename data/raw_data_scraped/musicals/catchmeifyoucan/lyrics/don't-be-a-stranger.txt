Don't Be A Stranger


PAULA

I always knew I'd see this day

I can't say it's a shock

What's that expression?

Qu'est-ce que c'est?

He's "a chip off the old block"

But if you see him

Please pass on this plea

Don't be a stranger

Tell him that for me



My Frankie had a clever mind

He could spend hours all alone

I wouldn't have been surprised to find

He changed his diaper on his own

Could I have been there more?

Well, c'est la vie

Don't be a stranger

Tell him that for me



Though I tried, I couldn't hide

When love had flown away

Children close their eyes

But still they see

I took a chance, a new romance

Is it a crime to say I made a choice

And chose what's best for me



His father had a head for dreams

But not the midas touch

His father had a million schemes

But dollars? Not so much



You want the apple

Go look for the tree

and don't be a stranger

Tell him that for me





FRANK SR.

I used to have what made her smile

But now, it's all been spent

I've tons of charm, I'm lousy with style

But that don't pry the rent

So if you spot her out there on a spree

Tell her don't be a stranger

Tell her that for me



I used to be a prince to her

This prince had lost his crown

I brought her laughs, she wanted fur

No wonder love fell down

Arrest the clown who said

The best things in life are free

Then, don't be a stranger

Tell her that for me



One more round at the lost and found

That's if you've got the dough

Happy hour is suddenly last call





PAULA

My eyes are dry, I said goodbye

So many tears ago





BOTH

The past is just a photo on the wall





FRNAK SR.

I guess to you I seem a schmuck

Well, I'll just bide my time





PAULA

In love, all's fair





FRNAK SR.

'Cause I believe that lady luck

Can still turn on a dime





PAULA

Comme a la guere





FRNAK SR.

And maybe one

Will once again be three





PAULA

C'est c'que j'ai toujours dit





FRNAK SR.

Don't be a stranger

Tell them that for me





PAULA

Don't be a stranger

Tell him that for me





BOTH

(No) Don't be a stranger

Tell him (them) that for me
