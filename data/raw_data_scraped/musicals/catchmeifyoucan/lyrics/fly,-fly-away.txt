Fly, Fly Away


When I was a child, my eyes were clear, I saw the good side

That's the kind of second sight that doesn't last too long

But when I was lost, I heard a voice that brought me healing

That's the kind of special hope he brought me with his song

People only saw the doctor, lawyer, Indian chief

But he was just a lonely little boy to me

With his sweet and gentle touch he sure unlocked my soul

So in return I surely want to help to set him free

Yeah, now I wanna see him fly, fly

I'll be your alibi, my baby

Fly, fly, fly away

We didn't get to say goodbye, goodbye

No need to tell me why, my baby

Maybe it's because you'll fly back home to me one day



Men who they call real were really fakes who left me nothing

But this man you call a fake gave me something real

I've known cruel, cruel men with Christian names that taught me manners

But this man without a name taught me how to feel

They only saw the magic tricks, the smoke and mirrors

Was I the only one to ever see the boy?

So now they want to clip his precious wings and bring him down

But in his heart and soul's the kind of good they can't destroy

Yeah now I wanna see him fly, fly

I'll be your alibi, my baby

Fly, fly, fly away

We didn't get to say goodbye, goodbye

No need to tell me why, my baby

Maybe it's because you'll fly back home to me one day



Baby, when you're in the clouds, please keep a lookout

Maybe, darling, find a hideaway for you and I, you and I



And I'll see you fly, fly

I'll be your alibi, my baby

Fly, fly, fly away

We didn't get to say goodbye, goodbye

No need to tell me why, my baby

Maybe it's because you'll fly back home to me one day

Maybe it's because you'll fly back home to me one day

Maybe it's because you'll fly back home to me one day



And I'll be waiting for you there

You will fly back home to me one day
