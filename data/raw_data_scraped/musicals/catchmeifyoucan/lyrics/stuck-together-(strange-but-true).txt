Stuck Together (Strange But True)


HANRATTY:

Stop your sobbing kid before I shoot

Your nose is running on my only suit

Who'd have thought I share this dance with you

Looks like we're stuck together which is strange but true



FRANK, JR.:

Yes you've caught me. Now the chase is done.

You must admit I gave you quite the run

Mr. Tortoise, here's your rabbit stew.

Looks like we're stuck together which is strange but true



HANRATTY:

Tell Mr. Ripley at Believe It or Not



BOTH:

The show is over and he's all that I got



HANRATTY:

Hard to believe it, but we're tyin' the knot today



FRANK, JR.:

That's ok.



HANRATTY:

Frank!

Thank your public while you're still in your prime

They won't be seeing you for quite a long time

And after you pay for your life of crime

Well kid, we'll see what good behavior can do



BOTH:

Til then, we're stuck together which is strange but true



FRANK, JR. (SPOKEN):

Mr. Hanratty turns out to be as good as his word.



HANRATTY (SPOKEN):

Frank was sentenced to 15 years years in prison but was released after 7 for good behavior.



FRANK, JR. (SPOKEN):

Carl and I became great friends and he even became the godfather to my kids.

I set up my own security company and paid back every bad check I ever passed.



HANRATTY (SPOKEN):

Alright, Frank, keep your promise. How did you cheat the bar exam?



FRANK, JR. (SPOKEN):

I didn't cheat. I studied.



HANRATTY (SPOKEN):

You're kidding me! I hate this guy! How does he do it?



ALL:

Hey, Mr. Lawyer, Mr. Two On The Aisle

You never can predict when fortune may smile



HANRATTY:

In fact, I think I'm gonna break with tradition

And tell J. Edgar Hoover, baby, I've gone fishin'!



FRANK, JR. (SPOKEN):

You're gonna take a day off.



HANRATTY (SPOKEN):

You heard me!



FRANK, JR.:

I you had read this, you'd have said, "No way."

I almost made it look like crime does pay

There's lots of folks that I miss every day



BOTH:

But now a new duet has made its debut

And now we're stuck together



ALL:

Oh yea!



BOTH:

Out of luck together



ALL:

Oh yea!



BOTH:

And now we're stuck together which is strange

But

True



FRANK, JR.:

Your junior partner came through



HANRATTY:

A simple case of monkey see, monkey do.



FRANK, JR. (SPOKEN):

Aw, come on. Hey, listen.

(SUNG)

I'm glad to be on your team.



HANRATTY:

Frank, let's make some butter out of cream.



FRANK, JR. (SPOKEN):

That's really nice.



HANRATTY (SPOKEN):

Alright kid. Let's get outta here.
