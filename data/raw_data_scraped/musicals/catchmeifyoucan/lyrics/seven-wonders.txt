Seven Wonders


I've seen the seven wonders

If you give or take a few

But all them seven wonders

Well they can't compare to you

I've been a lot of places

Yes, I've traveled near and far

But now I know that home is where you are



Niagara Falls - a leaky faucet that a plumber oughta fix

The Pyramids are really [uh huh] just a dusty pile of bricks

The Taj Mahal a fixer upper

The Grand Canyon just a hole [oh no]

The Grand Canal in Venice an Italian toilet bowl [That's wrong]



I've seen the seven wonders

If you give or take a few

But all them seven wonders

Well they can't compare to you

I've been a lot of places

Yes, I've traveled near and far

But now I know that home is where you are



The Aurora Borealis - just a night light on the fritz

And Stonehenge is just a bunch of rocks

La Brea's tar - the pits

How 'bout the Leaning Tower of Pisa it looks like somethin' up and broke

Mount Rushmore someone climb up there and tell them boys a joke



Yes my travellin' days are over

You get the check I'll pay the bill

Cause I see all the wonder in your eyes

Just standin' still.



I've been a lot of places

But I've learned now near and far

There's no need to roam

Cause home is where you are

There's no need to roam

'Cause home is where you are

Yes, now I know that home is where you are.
