(Our) Family Tree


CAROL

I feel a mighty quake

The south begins to shake

Under our family tree



The leaves begin to blow

Gone with the wind they go

All through our family tree



Up top magnolias bloom

They spread their sweet perfume

For this ancestral jubilee



Now every bough must pull it's weight

It's time to prune and propagate

Welcome to our family tree



ROGER

I hear the dogwood's bark

A seed's begun to spark

Inside our family tree



A twig begins to poke

From out that mighty oak

To join the jamboree



And like a slide trombone

He glides out fully grown

A dixieland R.S.V.P.



And no one minds an extra limb



CAROL

Especially when it looks like him!



ROGER & CAROL

So welcome to our family tree



BRENDA & LADIES

I feel a burst of spring

My trunk begins to swing

Just like our family tree



The cousins come to call

They'll stay until next fall

'Cause there's lots of fixins

And they're free



MEN

Save some of that gumbo for me



BRENDA & LADIES

The kin folk gather 'round

They've covered lots of ground

There's not a soul left in Tennessee



BRENDA

They've all arrived to germinate

To fertilize and



BRENDA & LADIES

Cultivate

And populate our family tree



FRANK JR.

I'll give a rebel yell

To every southern belle

Under our family tree



I'll swing the second line

When our two clans combine

For some big.....



ALL

...Easy harmony



FRANK JR.

Trumpets begin to shout

To welcome your new sprout

You've charmed this yankee refugee



You're all so lush and overgrown

But I know I'll never be alone

I'm glad to climb your family tree



FRANK JR & THE STRONGS

Your love has raised the bar

I'm swingin' on a star



FRANK JR.

For that who needs a law degree?!?!



LADIES

The trees that bear the ripest fruits



MEN

Are trees that have the deepest roots, so....



ALL

Welcome to our family

Welcome to our family



FRANK JR.

I'm
