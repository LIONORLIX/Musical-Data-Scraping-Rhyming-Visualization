The Man Inside The Clues


Hanratty: (Talking)

The Flash?

Peanut butter?

Maybe he's got a kid?

Alright, Mr. Taylor, I know you're in here somewhere.



Hanratty: (Singing)

Some comic books

A Miss July

A matchbook from "The Flame"

Some chewing gum

A mismatched pair of shoes



A letter home

But wasn't mailed

A check without a name

Yeah, they'll be my guide

To the man inside the clues



A bobby pin

Two baseball cards

Some day-old Chinese food

Two ticket stubs

Ah, the Red Sox always lose



A valentine

But wasn't sent

A scent to set the mood

When I take a ride

With the man inside the clues



"Do Not Disturb" is on the door

The maid, she never comes

He locked the door

But I don't need a key



There's only garbage on the floor

To others, they're just crumbs

Those crumbs look like

A five-course meal to me



I used my head

To get in his

So I can think like him

I see he flies

And also cries the blues



But if I look

At my own life

I'm out here on a limb

Yeah, it's best to hid

Stay the man inside the clues



I've looked into so many lives

But never at my own

The trail I left is

Such a damn clich?



The lonely wife

The house for sale

A million nights alone

To wish you had

The things you threw away



Like a front door key

A home cooked meal

The happy bride and groom

Then life kicks in

And makes you pay your dues



And then you find

You're by yourself

In a single motel room

That's been occupied

By the man inside

The clues

The clues
