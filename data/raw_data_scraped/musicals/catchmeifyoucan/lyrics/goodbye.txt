Goodbye


It's my happy ending, now its time to say goodnight.

we can stop pretending, tell the spotlight man turn off my light.

Cause the show is done now, and its time to leave the stage. Yea!

The good guy won now and the band has no more songs to play.

Its a happy ending so Ill say.



Goodbye, Goodbye to all the make believe.

Goodbye theres no more magic up my sleeve.

Theres nothing left to act up here, ill take my bow and disappear.

No questions left for answering.

Theres only one word left to sing, Goodbye.



Its a happy ending, to the greatest show on earth.

Now the curtains descending and I hope you got your moneys worth.

Gonna stop the show now cause I wanna leave on top.

So get up and go now. Cause theres nothing left inside  my head.

Everything thats left to says been said



Goodbye, Goodbye to all the song and dance.

Goodbye off stage I stand a better chance.

The show is through the parts been played.

No standing in the wings afraid. No voilins or phony tears.

The word thats music to my ears is goodbye.

Well goodbye, goodbye, GOODBYE!!



Im not afraid of stopping, this end could be my start.

I wanna live a life and not just play a part.

Ill walk into the sunset, Ill sail across the sea,

the final word the last youll hear of me, Of me...



Is goodbye, Goodbye to every night alone.

Goodbye, goodbye to lives I dont own. Im tired of living on the stage.

A life thats only on the page.

Empty lies are in the past, ive tried before but heres the last goodbye.

Now goodbye, Goodbye, GOODBYE!!!
