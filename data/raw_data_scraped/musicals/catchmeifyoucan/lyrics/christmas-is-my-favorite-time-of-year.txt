Christmas Is My Favorite Time Of Year


[HANRATTY]

Yeah, don?t you love the yuletide fun?

There?s joy and cheer for everyone

I wait for Santa with a gun

Yes, Christmas is my favorite time of year



[FRANK JR.]

Some sugar plums I haven?t kissed

But mistletoe I must resist

?Cause I?m on St. Frank?s most wanted list



[BOTH]

Yes, Christmas is my favorite time of year



[ALL]

And there?s a home

Where you can?t go

And there?s a life

That?s full of love you used to know



[FRANK SR.]

For me, it?s true, but kid, not you



[+ PAULA]

?Cause your family?s here

Yeah, they?re still yours to hold

If you come in from the cold



[HANRATTY]

So if tomorrow, Santa?s flown

The tree is down and you?re alone

I?m always here right by the phone



[+ FRANK JR.]

Yes, Christmas is my favorite time of year



[HANRATTY]

Wait a minute, wait a minute? You didn?t call me to apologize, did you? You?ve got no one else to talk to



[FRANK JR.]

Look out the window



[HANRATTY]

Why?



[FRANK JR.]

Just do it



I?ll call you soon but who knows when?



[HANRATTY]

And Frank, I hope we?ll meet again

Like when you?re serving eight to ten



[BOTH]

Yes, Christmas is my favorite time of year



[HANRATTY]

He?s a kid?

He?s a kid!
