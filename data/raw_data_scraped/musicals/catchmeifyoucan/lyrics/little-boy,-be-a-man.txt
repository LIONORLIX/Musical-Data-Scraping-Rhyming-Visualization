Little Boy, Be A Man


FRANK SR:

Little boy, be a man

Yeah, that was pop\'s only plan

He never kissed me

Or sang \"Baby mine\"

Sure, I\'d have loved a hug

But hey, I came out just fine



And I ever would cry

He\'d smack the tear from out my eye

He told me \"Grow up, kid,

You\'re no Peter Pan.

Little boy, be a man\".



HANRATTY:

Little man, grow some balls

That motto rang

Throught the halls

On my tenth birthday

He showed me a gun

Then took me to the cornfliefds

And said \"Okay ... run!\"



His sense of humor was lame

Lucky for me, sa was his aim!

If he had sewn some needlepoint

That hung on the walls

It woulda said \"Little man,

Grow some balls\".



BOTH:

Ballgames that he missed

Nights he came home pissed

Well I don\'t think about

That any longer



HANRATTY:

No one in the bleachers



FRANK SR:

Fistfights with my teachers



BOTH:

I\'m living proof what

Doesn\'t kill ya

Makes ya stronger!



FRANK SR:

Little man, little me

They come with no warranty

I tried to fix it

But who would\'ve guessed

It\'s hard to say but father ...



BOTH:

... Doesn\'t always know best



FRANK SR:

So Carl, when you have a kid



HANRATTY:

My ex said heaven forbid



FRANK SR:

Do as I say, not as I did



BOTH:

Like dad after dad after

dad after dad

Since the whole mess began



FRANK SR:

You do the best that you can



HANRATTY:

Little boy, be a man
