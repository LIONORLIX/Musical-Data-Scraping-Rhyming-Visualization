Harry Freakin' Potter


Ron:



You're harry freakin' potter!

You don't understand

You're a legend, man,

To us all!



Every son and daughter--



Ron & the kids: [spoken] "safe!"



Ron:



... From you-know-who,

All because of you!

You were small,

But i wonder if you can recall...



[chorus: oooo...]



Ron:



Long story short,

This guy,

[whispered] "voldemort"

Was super cruel...



Harry:



[spoken] "voldemort?"



The kids:



[gasp!] "shhh!!!"



Chorus: oooo...]



Ron:

... Tried to kill you & your parents,

And this is where it gets intensely cool...



Even though you were a tiny little boy,

You shoulda died but you survived and then destroyed

This evil guy and it's story we enjoy to tell....



Ron & the kids:



You're harry freakin' potter!

We don't prefer gandalf,

Merlin, or oz,

You're a whole lot hotter!

With that lighting scar,

You're a superstar to us all!

If we're in trouble we know who to call!



[dance break]



Rita skeeter:



You're harry freakin' potter!

I wouldn't wince at all,

You're invincible to all harm!



Like betty crocker--



Rita skeeter & the kids:



[oooh!]



Rita:



... I wanna eat you up!

No one'll beat you up

With that charm!

Remember, harry, kid,

You're the boss,

You're the king,

You're the bomb!



Harry:



But this is all so sad,

I mean, my mom and dad

Were killed, long ago...



The kids:



[long ago they died!]



Harry:



... I wanna be psyched,

But being unliked

Is all i know...



Chorus:



[... All he knows, that's why--]



Harry:



I never thought i'd be a part of such a fate,

An opportunity eleven years late...

I guess it's time for me step up to the plate

And show 'em that i'm something great!



I'm harry freakin' potter!

I'll do what i can

If what you say i am is true!



I can't be bothered

By my awful past,

I've found at last

Something i can do,

So it's time i knew

Exactly who i am...



I'm harry freakin' potter!



The kids:



You're harry freakin' potter!



Harry & the kids



I'm/you're harry freakin' potter--



Harry:



... And i'm the man!



The kids:



[ahhhhhh]



Harry & the kids:



[spoken] "harry freakin' potter!"
