Guys Like Potter


Lucius:



There are so many douchebags in the world.

Yes, so many douchebags get the girls

Who deserve more than absolutely anything

That any charm or potion could ever bring.

But men like that, they have her on a string,

And they don't care,



For there will always be guys like potter.

To realize tears in your eyes because he got her.

She'll never ever know how much you'd have brought her...



If you'd only done

Something more for the one,

Back when you were young...



Snape:



So many assholes in this place.

So many assholes in my face!

Why can't they leave me alone--

To love princesses, maids, and queens?

They wouldn't ever be in between...



Lucius & snape:



We'd treat them nice and never be mean.

And we would care...



But there will always be guys like potter.

Who'll quench the flame like it's a game with drops of water

He'll never ever think her perfect as you/i thought her...



Lucius:



... But now you're alone,

Left to pout and moan,

'Cause you were totally powned.
