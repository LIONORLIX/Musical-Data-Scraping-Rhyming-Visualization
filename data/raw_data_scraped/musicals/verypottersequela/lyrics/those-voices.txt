Those Voices


Harry:



I know you.

I've seen you in a dream ,

An old familiar scene, from somewhere...



You know me.

There's glowing in your eyes,

I know i recognize, from somewhere...



Those voices,

Singing out,

"la, la, la, la, la..."



Lily & james:



La, la, la, la, la...



Harry, lily & james:



La, la, la, la, la... La.



Sirius:



I see them.

They were people that i loved,

You were barely old enough

To be there.



But i know you.

You have your mothers eyes,

Beneath your dad's untidy dark hair.



Those voices,

Ringing out,

"la, la, la, la, la..."



Lily & james:



La, la, la, la, la...



Sirius, lily & james:



La, la, la, la, la...



Sirius:



I would never do

Anything that could hurt you!

They were both my family!



You're all that's left of what i knew,

You must know somewhere that it's true!

Do you understand me?



Harry:



[spoken] "yeah, i do."



Harry & sirius:



Those voies

Reaching out,

"la, la, la, la, la..."



Lily & james:



La, la, la, la, la...



Harry & sirius, lily & james:



La, la, la, la, la... La.
