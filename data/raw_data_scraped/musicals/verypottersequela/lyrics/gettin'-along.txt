Gettin' Along


Dumbledore:

I bet

You're the one who gets

All of the boys to buy you things.



Umbridge:



I'm sure

That you get all the girls

To beg you for their wedding rings.



Dumbledore:



I like your twisted humor!



Umbridge:



I like your mystic rumors!



Dumbledore & umbridge:



I'd say we can assume we're

Gonna get along!



Umbridge:



You're not

Like average joes,

Or jims or tims or johns.



Dumbledore:



... And i'd wager

That you'd never run from danger

With those muscles made of bronze!



I can safely shout

Without a doubt

That it won't take very long...



Dumbledore & umbridge:



... Before we're getting--

--and not regretting--

Ever setting on gettin' along!



[dance break]



Dumbledore:



You are a beautiful sample!

For example,

My gosh-- you're so strong!



What's-a matter with me?



Umbridge:



Now you're just flattering me!



Dumbledore & umbridge:



... Oh, how we're both just gettin' along!



Umbridge:



I've never felt this way before...



Dumbledore:



[spoken] "felt how?"



Umbridge:



[spoken] "um, intimidated..."



... You have such prominence and poise.



Dumbledore:



[spoken] "oh, that ol' thing--"



... Baby, it's just me, dumbledore.



So just try to relax,

Face the facts:

You feel just like one of the boys!



Umbridge:



[spoken] "one of the boys? I do?!"



Dumbledore:



[spoken] "oh you should, baby!"



Umbridge:



Yes sir,

You're the one professor

That'd i'd want detention from!



Dumbledore:



Umbridge-

You're the handsome wizard

That'd i want an extension from!



Umbridge:



[spoken] "... And you'll get one, too!"



Dumbledore:



I'll get the door!



Umbridge:



Oh, you'll get much more!



Dumbledore & umbridge:



Either way we can't go wrong...



With how shamelessly

And how famously

We're both just getting' along...



We'll be get, get, gettin',

Get, get, gettin',

Gettin' along!
