Not Over Yet


Lucius:



Don't ever tell me what i can't do

I'd watch my tongue if i were you

For all we know, you-know-who

Could be watching us



Yaxley:



[spoken] "he can't be, he's dead!"



Lucius:



That never stopped our plans before

You've no idea what i have in store!

You really think that you'd be at my door

If we had nothing to discuss?

He may be gone, but that is just as well...



So come inside, don't you fret

For it's not over yet!



Death eater chorus:



Evil plans!

We are making evil plans!

Evil deeds with evil hands!

We love making evil plans!



Lucius:



I know it seems impossible, we've been thrown

Off our track.

But if we can't move forward, why shouldn't we

Move back?



Friends and companions of evil and sin:

Think not of loss, but a new way to win.

For what is present without a beginning

To start it all?



Yaxley:



[spoken] "go on..."



Lucuis:



There is a boy that everyone knows;

The plan is simple: i propose that

We choke the weed before it grows

Up and ends it all



Do you follow me?



Death eater #1:



[spoken] "no."



Lucius:



The dark lord?

Would have survived, had they never met...



Death eater #2:



[spoken] "so you're saying that he wouldn't

Be destroyed?"



Lucius:



He'd be alive, what don't you get?



Death eater #3:



[spoken] "still not understanding..."



Lucius:



With potter gone, the future will be set!



Death eaters:



[spoken] "aaahhhhhh!"



Lucius:



... So it's not over yet!



Death eaters:



Evil plans!

What a brilliant evil plan!

Malfoy, you're an evil man!

We love making evil plans!



All:



Our history is nothing more

Than what the losers settle for



Lucius:



So look alive, and don't forget

That's it's not over



All:



It's not over,

No, it's not over yet!
