Days of Summer


Ron:

We've got these days of summer to,

Remind us of each other!



Hermione:

The time we have to spend apart,

Will keep us in each other's hearts!



Harry:

I'm hoping that the good old days

Are something i will dream about at night.



Draco:

Don't matter if it's sooner or later,

I know that it's gonna be all right!



All:

I don't wanna see you go,

But it's not forever,

Not forever!



Even if it was you know,

That i would never let it get me down!



'Cause you're the part of me,

That makes me better,

Wherever i go!



So i will try,

Not to cry,

But no one needs to say goodbye!
