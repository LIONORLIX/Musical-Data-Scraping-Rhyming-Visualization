Stutter (You Were Never My Lover)


Umbridge:



Remember that time?

When you wouldn't talk to me?

No you wouldn't talk to me

Yesterday.



We were gettin' along!

We had that little dance-y thing!

Well here's a song i sing

My way,



It was gonna be fine.

But you didn't wanna be,

Be the man who'd be with me--

No way.



But now you sayin' it's time--

Why you gotta be like that?

I don't like the way you act

'Round me.



So baby come on, come on...



Oh don't you tell me to go,

And say "i'm the one,"

D-d-do you think i'm dumb?

Sorry- did i just stutter?



Won't tell you what you know,

But this is the end...

You were never my friend,

You were never my--

You were never my lover!



Remember that night?

When i saw you tremblin' there?

I remember; i don't care--

'Bout you.



I'm rememberin' how

You thought you were at the top,

Well i think we're better off

Without you!



And i got your number--

And i don't mean in my phone;

Would've already just thrown it out,

If i'd known about

The way you'd bitch and moan,



You remember that way--

How you were way outta line?

Well now you're way outta time!

So tell me what you want on your tombstone!



Come on, come on...



Well don't you tell me to go,

And say "i'm the one,"

S-s-s-sorry sir, we done!

'Scuse me, did i just stutter?



Won't tell you what you know,

But this is the end...

You were never my friend,

You were never my--

You were never my lover!



It's too bad you a loser.

Too bad you waste my time.

Good thing that i'm around

To keep your ass in line!



... You were never my--

You were never my lover!
