The Coolest Girl


Hermione



All my dreams

I'm chasing after,

They don't need

All this laughter...



I take a grain of salt,

A stiff upper lip.

It's not their fault

I'm not as hip.

Wake up kid, you know you're more than this...



I'm the smartest person

That i've ever met.

So why do i allow myself to

Possibly forget:



There's so much i know how to do,

So much more than all of you.

The only thing i wish i knew

Was how to make them see

The girl that i can be....



I am

The coolest girl in the whole wide world

I know it

But can't show it at all.



I am

Sick and tired

Of low, not higher

Places, where i should belong...

It's about time i proved them wrong...



Give me a shot

To show what i've got!

I'm a hell of a whole lot more



Than this frizzy hair,

These frumpy clothes i wear,

Though i rock 'em like nobody you've seen

Before!



'Cause i am

The coolest girl in the whole wide world

I know it

Below it all.



I am

Done with losin',

On with choosin'



The coolest girl on the face of the planet,

The coolest bitch on earth, goddammit!

The coolest chick you've ever seen or heard!



So you can try to break me down,

But sorry guys, i'm stickin' around!

I've thought about it, and i've found



That i am

The coolest girl!

...yeah!
