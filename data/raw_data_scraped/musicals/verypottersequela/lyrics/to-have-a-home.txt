To Have a Home


Home,

I've heard the word before,

But it never meant much more

Than just a thing i've never had.



A "place,"

They say, "hey, know your place!"

But i've never had a place to even know,

Or a face that i could go to

If i needed someone there...



I'm laughing

It's hard to hide a smile

My god, it's been a while

Since i have had a reason to.



To think

It's been here all along

Somewhere to belong,

And a reason,

A something-to-believe-in



I've finally found it,

A place where i'm wanted...

This must be how it feels to have a home



I used to dream about it

But never schemed or counted

On fantasies or wishes-

It breaks a man to see what he misses



And so many nights i'd pray

For a better life, a better day

But i never thought that it'd come true

It's finally here and i don't know what to do

And i'm trying not to cry



This must be how it feels

To have a home



I've finally made it

I've hoped and i've waited

And for the first time in my life, i don't feel so

Alone



My heart starts to heal

To know this is real.

This is how it must feel
