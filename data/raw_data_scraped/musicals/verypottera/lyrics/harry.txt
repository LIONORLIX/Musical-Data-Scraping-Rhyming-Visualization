Harry


Ginny:

The way his hair falls in his eyes

Makes me wonder if hell

Ever see through my disguise

And im under his spell



Everything is falling and i dont know where to land

Everyone knows who he is but they dont know who i am



Harry, harry,

Why cant you see

What youre doing to me



Ive seen you conquer certain death

And even when youre just standing there you take away my breath

And maybe someday youll hear my song

And understand that all along

Theres something more that im trying to say

When i say



Harry, harry, harry

Why cant you see

What youre doing to me
