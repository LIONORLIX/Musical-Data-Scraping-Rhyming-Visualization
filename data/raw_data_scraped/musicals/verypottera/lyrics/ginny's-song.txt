Ginny's Song


Harry:

Youre tall and fun and pretty

Youre really, really skinny

Ginny



Im the mickey to your minnie

Youre the tigger to my winnie

Ginny



Wanna take you to the city

Gonna take you out to dinney

Ginny



Youre cuter than a guinnie pig

Wanna take you up to winnipeg

Thats in canada!



Ginny ginny ginny ginny---

You know this song doesn't go with your name at all.
