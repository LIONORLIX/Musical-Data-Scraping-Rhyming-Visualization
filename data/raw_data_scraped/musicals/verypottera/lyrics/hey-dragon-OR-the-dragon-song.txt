Hey Dragon / The Dragon Song


Harry:

(spoken)

Uh... Uh... Accio guitar!



Hey dragon

You don't gotta do this

Let's reevaluate our options

Throw away our old presumptions

Cause really, you don't wanna go through this.



I'm really not that special

The boy who lived is only flesh and bone



Dragon (cho chang, draco, cedric):

Awwww



Harry:

The truth is in the end, i'm pretty useless without friends.

In fact, i'm alone.

Just like now

Anyhow



I spend my time at school, trying to be this cool guy

I never even asked for it

Don't know any spells, i still manage to do well because there's only so long i can last for.



I'm living off the glory of a stupid children's story

That i had nothing to do with

Just sat there and got lucky

So level with me buddy?

I can't defeat me...

So please don't eat me.



All i can do

Is sing this song for you

La la la la la



Dragon:

Ra ra ra ra ra



Harry:

La la la la la



(repeat both 2x)



That's right, dragon!

You never asked to be a dragon?

I never asked to be a champion!



Dragon:

Yeah!



Harry:

We just jumped on the bandwagon

But all be need is guitar jamming.



So la la la la la



Dragon:

Ra ra ra ra ra



Harry:

La la la la la



Dragon:

Ahhhhhhh... Hm...



Harry:

Goodnight dragon.



Dragon: ahhhh...



Harry:

(spoken)

I beat the dragon!
