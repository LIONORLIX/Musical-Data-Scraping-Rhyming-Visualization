Goin' Back to Hogwarts


Harry:

Underneath these stairs

I hear the sneers and feel glares of

My cousin, my uncle and my aunt.



Can't believe how cruel they are

And it stings my lighting scar

To know that they'll never ever give me what i want.



I know i don't deserve these

Stupid rules made by the dursleys

Here on privet drive.



Can't take all of these muggles,

But despite all of my struggles,

I'm still alive.



Im sick of summer and this waiting around.

Man, its september, and im skipping this town

Hey its no mystery, theres nothing here for me now



I gotta get back to hogwarts,

I gotta get back to school.

Gotta get myself to hogwarts,

Where everybody knows i'm cool.



Back to wizards and witches, and magical beasts,

To goblins and ghosts and to magical feasts.

Its all that i love, and it's all that i need.

Hogwarts, hogwarts, i think i'm going back---



I'll see my friends, gonna laugh 'til we cry

Take my firebolt, gonna take to the sky

No way this year anyone's gonna die, and it's gonna be totally awesome



I'll cast some spells, with a flick of my wand

Defeat the dark arts, yeah bring it on!

And do it all with my best friend ron, 'cuz together we're totally awesome



Ron: yeah, and it's gonna be totally awesome!



Dialogue



Ron:

It's been so long, but we're going back

Don't go for work, don't go there for class



Harry:

As long as were together--



Ron:

-- gonna kick some ass



Harry & ron:

... And its gonna be totally awesome!

This year we'll take everybody by storm,

Stay up all night, sneak out of our dorm



Hermione:

But let's not forget that we need to perform well in class

If we want to pass our owls!



Dialogue



Hermione:

I may be frumpy, but i'm super smart

Check out my grades, they're "a's" for a start

What i lack in looks well i make up in heart,

And well guys, yeah, that's totally awesome



This year i plan to study a lot...



Ron:

That would be cool if you were actually hot



Harry:

Hey ron, come on, we're the only friends that she's got!



Ron:

And that's cool...



Hermione:

... And that's totally awesome



Harry, ron, hermione:

Yeah it's so cool, and it's totally awesome!



We're sick of summer and this waiting around

It's like we're sitting in the lost and found

Don't take no sorcery

For anyone to see how...



We gotta get back to hogwarts

We gotta get back to school

We gotta get back to hogwarts

Where everything is magic-cooooool



Everyone:

Back to wizards and witches, and magical beasts

To goblins and ghosts and to magical feasts

It's all that i love, and it's all that i need at

Hogwarts, hogwarts



Harry, ron, hermione:

--- i think we're going back...
