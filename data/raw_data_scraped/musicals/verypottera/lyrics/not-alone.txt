Not Alone


Harry:

Ginny, don't you see?

It's hopeless.



Ginny:

I've been alone,

Surrounded by darkness.

And i've seen how heartless,

The world can be.



And i've seen you crying.

You've felt like it's hopeless.

But i'll always do my best to make you see...



Baby, you're not alone,

Cos you're here with me.

And nothing's ever gonna bring us down 'cos nothin' can keep me from lovin' you.

And you know it's true.

It don't matter what'll come to be,

Our love is all we need to make it through.



Ginny:

Now, i know it ain't easy.

(harry: know it ain't easy.)

But it ain't hard trying.

(harry: it's so hard trying.)



Both:

Every time i see you smiling,



Ginny:

And i feel you so close to me.

You tell me...



Both:

Baby, you're not alone,

Cos you're here with me.

And nothing's ever gonna bring us down 'cos nothin' can keep me from lovin' you.

And you know it's true.

It don't matter what'll come to be,

Our love is all we need to make it through.



Harry:

Now, i still have troubles.

I trip and stumble try'n to make sense of things sometimes.

And i look for reasons,

But i don't need 'em.

All i need is to look in your eyes and i realize (riff).



Ron (spoken):

Hey, harry!



Harry (spoken):

Ron, hermione, harry, & ginny:

Baby, you're not alone,

Cos you're here with me.

And nothing's ever gonna bring us down 'cos nothin' can keep me from lovin' you.

And you know it's true.

It don't matter what'll come to be,

Our love is all we need to make it through.



Harry:

It don't matter what'll come to be,



All:

Our love is all we need,



Harry:

To make (riff)
