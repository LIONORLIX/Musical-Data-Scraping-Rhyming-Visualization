Granger Danger


Ron:

Here i am face to face

With a situation i never thought i'd ever see, it's strange

How a dress can take a mess

And make her nothing less than

Beautiful to me



Feels like my eyes have been transfigured,

Something deep inside has changed

They've been open wide but hold that trigger



This could mean danger!



I'm falling in love, falling in love, falling in love,

I think i'm falling in love, falling in love, falling in love,

With hermione granger



Draco:

What, what the hell is this?

You expect me to sing about her,

Don't care about her.

It's just a little makeup-

Draco wake, i'm mistaken

She is the hottest girl i've ever seen

Now, because she's like a girl i've never seen

Don't know why i'd ever be so mean

This could mean danger!



I'm falling in love, falling in love, falling in love,

I could be falling in love, falling in love, falling in love,

With hermione granger.



Both:

I wanna let her know



Draco:

I feel so queasy



Both:

But i can't let it show



Ron:

She laugh, poor weasley

C'mon, ron



Draco:

Draco



Both:

You gotta let it go,

You gotta let it go!



Ron:

Here i am face to face

(draco: what, what the hell is this?)

With a situation i never thought i'd ever see, it's strange

(draco: i want to sing about her, sing about her)

How a dress can take a mess

(draco: i want to make up,)

And make her nothing less than

(draco: granger, wake up)

Beautiful to me

(draco: i've been mistaken)

Seems like my eyes have been transfigured

(draco: she is the hottest girl i've ever seen)

Something deep inside has changed

(draco: now, because she's like a girl i've never seen)

They've been opened wide but hold that trigger

(draco: don't know why i'd ever be so mean)



Both:

This could mean danger!



I'm falling in love, falling in love, falling in love,

I think i'm falling in love, falling in love, falling in love,

With hermione granger,

With hermione granger,

With hermione granger-

Danger!
