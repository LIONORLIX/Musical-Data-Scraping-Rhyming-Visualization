Ginny's Song Reprise (Cho's Song)


Harry:

Youre tall and fun and pretty

Youre really, really skinny

Cho chang



Im the mickey to your minnie

You're the tigger to my winnie

Cho chang



Wanna take you to the city

Get all up in your titties

Cho chang



You're cuter than a guinea pig

Wanna take you up to winnipeg

Thats in canada!



Cho cho cho cho cho chang, cho chang.

Cho cho cho ch-ch-ching chong ching chong ching chong ch-ch-china ching chong cho chang.



(spoken)

So what do you think?
