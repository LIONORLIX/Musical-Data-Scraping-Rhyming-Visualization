Missing You


Harry:

I can't remember dad

And i cant remember mom

Aunts and uncle aren't quite the same



But i had him, and life seemed fair

Yes, when i had him, he was there

To give me strength, show concern

Ask for nothing in return

Say hello, talk me through

Do the things that fathers should do



And i'm missing you

I'm just missing you



Quirrell:

There it is, he's gone

And he's hung me out to dry

The joy he said he felt, well, i guess it was a lie

But when i had him, my life was fine

When i had him, he was mine



He'd share his thoughts be a friend

Stick with me until the end

Watch a movie, roller-skate

Fill the world with fear and hate



Harry & quirrell:

And im missing you

Im just missing you



Now i'm all alone

Now you're gone for good

Now i'm stuck right here wishing i understood



Harry:

You gave me hope when my spells weren't right



Quirrell:

You gave me someone to hold every night



Quirrell:

And i'm missing you



Harry:

I'm just missing you



Quirrell:

I'm just missing you

Harry:

I'm just missing you
