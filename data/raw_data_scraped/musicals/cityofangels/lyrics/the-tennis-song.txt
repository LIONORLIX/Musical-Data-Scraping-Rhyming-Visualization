The Tennis Song


STONE:

You seem at home on the court



ALAURA:

Let's say that i've played around



STONE:

Well you don't look like the sort



ALAURA:

My hidden talents abound

A competitor hasn't been found to defeat me



STONE:

I'll bet you're a real good sport



ALAURA:

Shall we say the ball is in your court



STONE:

I'll bet you like to play rough



ALAURA:

I like to work up a sweat



STONE:

And you just can't get enough



ALAURA:

I'm good for more than one set

But i promise i'll show no regret

If you beat me



STONE:

My backhand is clearly my forte



BOTH:

Shall we say the ball is in your court



ALAURA:

No one ever plays with me



STONE:

I thought your next of kin did



ALAURA:

My husband never plays with me

He's too easily winded.



STONE:

You leave me breathless too



ALAURA:

Wait till our match is through



STONE:

I may lack form and finesse

But i warm up in a jiff



ALAURA:

It's not exciting unless

The competition is stiff



STONE:

I think i understand your racket

I'm not in your league



ALAURA:

But you can hack it



STONE:

This game commences with love



ALAURA:

Well i think love is a bore



STONE:

Let's give the tempo a shove



ALAURA:

And raise the stakes a bit more



BOTH:

One thing i'm positive of

It's time for someone to score



STONE:

Tell me how you like to play



ALAURA:

On grass or clay

And ev'ry day



STONE:

They're both o.k.



ALAURA:

But time is running short

Darling, let's don't dilly dally



STONE:

Ready for a rousing rally



BOTH:

Shall we say the ball is in your court



ALAURA:

Shall we say the ball is in your court
