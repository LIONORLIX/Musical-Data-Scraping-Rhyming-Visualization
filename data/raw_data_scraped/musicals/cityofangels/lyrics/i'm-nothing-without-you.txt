I'm Nothing Without You


STINE & STONE:

I'm nothing without you

Without you i lack what it takes

Unless we're combined

I have half a mind

To blow all my chances and breaks



(STINE hands STONE the gun; STONE hands STINE a pencil)



Without you i'm bupkis

A flop who keeps dropping the ball

It's time to stop quaking

Start taking the lead

And you are the singular buddy i need



I'm nothing without you

Without you i'm nothing...



(STONE gestures "Wait!," X's to the desk, sits at the typewriter)



STONE:

(Spoken, to STINE)

Let's give this a Hollywood ending!



(HE strikes a few keys on the typewriter

and the giant doors at the back of the sound stage open to admit GABBY,

who joins them, to the delight of the COMPANY, now unfrozen)



STINE, STONE & GABBY:

(Sing)

I'm nothing without you



STONE:

No hero



STINE:

A zero



STINE & STONE:

That's me



GABBY:

With you by my side



STONE:

There's no better guide



ALL THREE:

On how to be all i can be



I'm nowhere without you

To doubt you is where i went wrong



The script calls for fusing and using our smarts

(As STINE, STONE and GABBY get on the crane platform:)

And greatness can come from the sum of our parts

(The ENTIRE COMPANY joins in)



ALL:

From now and with on i'm with you

You is where i belong
