Double Talk


Stine

This job is not to be believed

And I cannot believe my luck

I'm at the literary prime of my life

And I'm about to have the time of my life

Unless I'm easily deceived

Though Buddy doesn't tend to sugarcoat his comments

He'll all right

All bark, no bite



I've always longed for a chance to be watching

A book of my own on the screen

To look up and see Stone on the screen

Would be better than fine

Sit with my wife in a crowd

As the credits are shown on the screen

In a frame all alone on the screen

It says "Screenplay by Stine"



For making movies out of books

They say that Buddy wrote the book

I can depend on him to give me some lip

But you can trust a guy who shoots from the hip

Out here where nothing's how it looks

It's hard to disregard a candid stand-up guy

Who skips the double talk

And lets you know exactly what he's thinking about you



And I can beat the odds

And meet his demands

Though I'm a stranger in

This strangest of lands



This mad adventure I've begun

Is unlike anything I know

It's gonna be a lotta work

And lots of fun

And pots of dough
