It Needs Work


GABBY:

No lack of alibis

Your knack for the spectacular is still intact

I like the tone of it

It rings sincere and pretty near succeeds

It's just the narrative

Is like a sieve and cloudy as a cataract

There's not a trace of honesty so face the fact

It needs ... work



You dodge emotion, dear

Your logic's unconvincing as it strains to please

Unlike the books you write

This plot is quite contrived the way it reads

It's far too obvious

And filled with flaws and gross implausibilities

Excepting for the part about the broken keys

It needs work



Your fiction always had

A little grit in it

A little heart in it

A little wit in it

It used to be so clear

That there was art in it

If you had written it

So must you go and spit in it

And come to think of it

Your writing always mirrors our relationship



With dangers cropping up

And sweet young strangers popping up like weeds

So if you wish official pardoning

You better do a little gardening

Ya know ya needn't be so gen'rous with your seeds

Your fertile lies don't fertilize

It needs work



We used to sit in bed and read each draft out loud

We'd play each part and talk the story through

Remember all we said and how we laughed out loud

Now take a closer look at you

I oughta throw the book at you



You had to ruin it

This plot has got a lot of deja vu in it

Familiarity

And in this case we both know what that breeds

But call me anytime you seem yourself

When you've decided to redeem yourself

When you discover where this self deception leads

I'd rather see you shoot yourself

Than watch you prostitute yourself

Your new routine is too routine

It needs work
