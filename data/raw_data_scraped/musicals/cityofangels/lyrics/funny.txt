Funny


STINE:

Funny,

How'd i fail to see this little bed time tale was funny?

I could cry to think of all the irony i've missed!

What an unusual twist

Right at the end of it



Funny,

Who could see that this pathetic scene would be

So funny

Once you strain to find the grain of humor

Underneath

Life double crosses with style

Forcing you into a smile

So it can kick you in the teeth



Just desserts

We can all laugh till it hurts

At my expense

I'm accustomed to working on "spec"

I always pick up the check



I think it's funny

Who could top or make this comic op'ra more

Compelling

You could weave in some deceit to even up the

Score



You'd have us all on the floor

That would be roaringly funny

Sad enough my life's a joke that suffers in the telling

Just another hoary chestnut from the bottom drawer

I've heard so often before

That i can't laugh anymore
