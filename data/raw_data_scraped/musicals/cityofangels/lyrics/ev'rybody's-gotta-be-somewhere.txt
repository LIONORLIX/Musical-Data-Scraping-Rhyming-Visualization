Ev'rybody's Gotta Be Somewhere


Angel City 4 Quartet

On the loose and so elusive

You won't find her till you've checked

Ev'ry avenue

Like a diamond

In a coal mine

She's where you would least expect



Try to track her down

Go over the whole darn town

Go on a fishin'

Expedition

Everybody's gotta be somewhere



Girls don't vanish in thin air

Everybody's gotta be somewhere

But where? Where? Where? Where?



Take a little looksee

Nose around

There's an underground crowd to scout

Use a little intuition if you wish

Your mission to pan out

Keep an open ear and

Trust your gut

Let the scuttlebutt cross your mind

If you're out of innuendo `round the bend

Are hits you've yet to find



Stone

Stay right on her trail



Quartet

(This tomato is a hot potato)



Stone

This case is a "beaut"



Quartet

(Dig deep and keep on digging)



Stone

She's the holy grail



Quartet

She's needle in haystack heaven



Stone

You're in a hot pursuit



Quartet

(You're warm and getting warmer)

Don't be so low keyed

Start following every lead

Don't put your feet up

Turn the heat up

Everybody's gotta be somewhere



Girls don't vanish in thin air

First ya gotta look left

Then ya gotta look right

Then ya better look high and low

Gotta run around town

Gotta play the old game

It's a little like tic tac toe



Stone

Where's that dame

Where's she gone to

She's a flame

That you're drawn to



Where I wonder am I gonna find this chick

It's quite a blunder to underestimate her

She's a stye in the eye of a private dick

She look familiar?



Porno Vendor

You don't know how many women I see each day

Beneath innumerable guys

Yours would be hard to forget I regret to say

She's one I never laid my eyes on



Stone

Where I wonder am I gonna find this chick

It's quite a blunder to underestimate her

She's a stye in the eye of a private dick

She look familiar?



Madam

Though I've never seen her

I've seen girls like these so young and ripe

Your missing miss is not the type

To miss a miss demeanor

Why-doncha Why-doncha Why-doncha

Let me choose a change of pace for broads like this

You came

To the right place



Stone

Where's that dame

Where's she gone



Two B Girls

You're quite a masterful detective

And it's your lucky day to stumble on us

(You'll find us a plus)

It hardly seems at random

You're wise to scrutinize us

We won't refuse

So take off your shoes

We'll search for cues in tandem



Quartet

Try to track her down

Go over the whole town

Better hope `n both eyes open



Girls don't vanish in thin air

She's lying low you're flying blind but

Ev'rybody's gotta be somewhere

Ev'rybody's gotta be somewhere
