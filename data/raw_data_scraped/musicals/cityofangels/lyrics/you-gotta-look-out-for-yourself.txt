You Gotta Look Out For Yourself


JIMMY & ANGEL CITY FOUR:

Ya gotta look out for yourself

If you're hoping to be first

Then ya better think "me first"

Or you're gonna finish last



Ya gotta look out for yourself

If you follow this format

You'll be nobody's doormat

It's a rule that's hard and fast



This world ain't pure

On this you can depend

You best be sure

That you're your own best friend



Ya gotta look out for yourself

If you're planning to do good

Then be sure it does you good

You don't wanna be too good



Ya gotta look out for yourself

Ya know the score when you adore yourself

When you're in danger you can count on me to shout

Look our for yourself.
