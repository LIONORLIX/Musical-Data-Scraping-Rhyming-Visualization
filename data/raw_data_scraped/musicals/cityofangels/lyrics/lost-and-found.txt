Lost And Found


MALLORY:

Mr. detective, you've been looking too hard

You should've started looking in your own back yard.



(STONE covers her with the sheet and turns on the lights)



Lost and found

Lost and found

You've earned your salary

Searching for mallory

Wanna play lost and found

Well, then, here i am

On the lam

You've been assigned to find out where i've been

And now you've found me in your bed

And though my daddy said to turn me in

Why don't i turn you on instead



Teasing lips

Pleasing thighs

Easy on

Private eyes



If you're not celibate

We could raise hell a bit

Why don't you call my bluff

Don't resist

You won't know what you've missed

You'll never tame me

But you can claim me

At the lost and found
