With Every Breath I Take-Duet


Stone

I try to tell myself

To let the memory of you die slow

Y letting time be my friend

By letting go of what was

The pain would end

It never does



Bobbi

At any time or place

I close my eyes and

See your face

and I'm embracing you

If only I believed

That

Dreams

Come true

Dar-

ling

You were the one who said

Forever from the

Start

And I've been drifting

Since you've gone



Out on a lonely sea that only

You can chart

I've been going on, knowing

That my

Heart

Will

Break



With every

Breath

I

Take

Stone:





At any time or place



I close my eyes



And see



Your face



And



I'm embrac-



ing you





If



On-ly



I be-



lieved that



Dreams



Come



True



At



Night out loud I pray





Bobbi, go away





How much must I take



To end this ache

I

Wel-

come

Death

With every breath

I

take
