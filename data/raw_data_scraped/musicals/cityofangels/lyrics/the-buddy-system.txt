The Buddy System


Buddy

I've got twelve nominations and half dozen Oscars

Nine cars and three ex-wives to show

That in this business of refuse and nephews I know

My stuff



You're a literary great

Who should have won a Pulitzer prize

I would never cannibalize

Or impair a single hair or phrase

Of your magazine opus



Still a lot of scribblers

Soon discover what they write for the screen

Isn't always right for the screen

So I intervene



I zipped through your book

And the characters jumped through life on the screen

Don't cling to the words to which you gave birth

Remember how many a picture is worth

The odds are a thousand to one so get used to it Stine

The book may be yours baby trust me the movie is mine



Ya learn from Von Sternberg

Ta grow from Von Stroheim

And so I'm the heir to their skill

This town has more nuts than Brazil

Let's face it I've been through DeMille



Authors unprepared to take

A stab at this collaborative art

Must suppress their egos and part

With the notion that in motion pictures

Words are carved in marble

Donna darling get this on a pad

And type it up for next week

I have an engagement to speak

At the Writer's Guild



You wouldn't want to upset Buddy

This is advice not a threat, buddy

But see how tough things can get, buddy

When things get rough it can get bloody

Baby nobody says no, buddy

So, buddy, you better concede

Let Buddy, be buddy

Pure Buddy

And he'll be your buddy

The buddy you need
