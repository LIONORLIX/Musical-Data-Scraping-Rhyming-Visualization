Stay With Me


JIMMY & ANGEL CITY FOUR:

I'm in a sentimental way

So stay with me

I'll ask the orchestra to play

Your fav'rite song



Thoughts that we would blush to say

Come easily in song

So why the rush to say so long



There's no one calling you away

So stay with me

What say we while away the day

And pay the price

For just this once

Let's not think twice
