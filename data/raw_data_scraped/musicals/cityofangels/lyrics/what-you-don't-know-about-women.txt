What You Don't Know About Women


GABBY:

What you don't know about women



OOLIE:

(What you don't know about women)



BOTH:

Could fill a shelf of books



GABBY:

You are the type of man who looks

For understanding lovers



OOLIE:

But never understands the girl

Who lies beneath the covers



BOTH:

You only have to open up your mouth to show



GABBY:

What you don't know



OOLIE:

(And you don't know)



BOTH:

About women

A woman needs to be assured

That she remains alluring

To now and then be reassured

Your passion is enduring



GABBY:

It's not enough to know your line

To polish and routine it



OOLIE:

(And heaven knows i know your line

The whole routine, i've seen it)



BOTH:

Ya gotta mean it



GABBY:

What you don't know about women



OOLIE:

(What you don't know about women)



BOTH:

Is what we need to hear



GABBY:

You think if you can sound sincere

Then we'll come running to you



OOLIE:

Throw in some truth for atmosphere

But we can see right through you



BOTH:

And ev'ry hollow compliment and phrase defines



GABBY:

And underlines



BOTH:

What you don't know about women



You think what i don't know will not hurt me

But you don't know how often you do

How long ago did good sense desert me

I don't know why i still burn for you



GABBY:

You're immature and shortsighted



OOLIE:

You're an incurable player



GABBY:

You show a lack of discretion



OOLIE:

You don't know jack about heartache



GABBY:

You're out of sync with your feelings



OOLIE:

You only wink at commitment



GABBY:

You're running low on emotion



BOTH:

What you don't know about women's

Only a drop in the ocean

Next to what you don't know about me

You are in need of

A little enlight'ning

On ladies and love

But you can't see



What you don't know about women

Is fright'ning

And you don't know nothin' about me
