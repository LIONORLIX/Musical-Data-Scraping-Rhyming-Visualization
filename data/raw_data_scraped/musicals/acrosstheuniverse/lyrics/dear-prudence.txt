Dear Prudence


Dana Fuchs:

Dear Prudence, won't you come out to play?

Dear Prudence, greet the brand new day..

The sun is up, the sky is blue

It's beautiful, and so are you

Dear Prudence, won't you come out to play?



Jim Sturgess:

Dear Prudence, open up your eyes



Evan Rachel Wood:

Dear Prudence, see the sunny skies...



Jim, Joe, and Evan:

The wind is low

The birds will sing

That you were part of everything



Joe Anderson:

Dear Prudence, won't you open up your eyes



Jim, Joe, and Evan:

Look around, round, round, round, round (x4)

Look around....



Dear Prudence, won't you come out to play?

Dear Prudence, greet the brand new day.

The sun is up, the sky is blue

Its beautiful, and so are you

Dear Prudence, won't you come out to play?



Look around, round, round, round, round (x8)

Look around......
