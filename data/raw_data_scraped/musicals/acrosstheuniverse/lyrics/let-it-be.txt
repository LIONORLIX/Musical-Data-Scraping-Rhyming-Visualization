Let It Be


When I find myself in times of trouble, Mother Mary



comes to me, speaking words of wisdom, let it be.



And in my hour of darkness she is standing right in



front of me, speaking words of wisdom, let it be.



Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be.



Whisper words of wisdom, let it be.



And when the broken hearted people living in this



world agree, there will be an answer, let it be. For



though they may be parted there is still a chance



that they will see, there will be an answer. let it be.



let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be



There will be an answer let it be.



And when the night is cloudy, there is still a light,



that shines on me, shine until tomorrow, let it be.



Ohhh, I wake up to the sound of music, mother



Mary, mother Mary comes to me, speaking words of



wisdom, i want you to let it be. yeah yeah yeah, let



it be, let it be, let it be. Oh let it be



Oh theres gonna be an answer, I want you to let it



be yeah yeah yeah let it be let it be let it beoh let it



be.......Whisper words of wisdom
