Revolution


You say you want a revolution

Well ya know

We all wanna change the world



You tell me that it's evolution

Well ya know

We all wanna change the world



But when you talk about destruction

Don?t cha know that you can count me out



Don't cha know it's gonna be alright

Ya know it's gonna be alright

Ya know it's gonna be alright



You say you?ll change the Constitution

Well ya know

We all wanna change your head



You tell me it's the institution

Well ya know

You better free your mind instead



But if you go carrying pictures  of Chairman Mao

You ain't gonna make it with anyone anyhow



Don?t cha know it's gonna be alright

Ya know it's gonna be alright

Ya know it?s gonna be alright

Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright

It's alright
