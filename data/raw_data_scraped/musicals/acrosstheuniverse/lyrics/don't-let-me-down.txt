Don't Let Me Down


Don't let me down

Don't let me down

Don't let me down

Don't let me down



Nobody ever loved me like he does

Ooh he does, yes he does

And if somebody loved me like she do me

Ooh she do me, yeah she does



Don't let me down

Don't let me down

Don't let me down

Don't let me down



Oh i'm in love for the first time

Don't you know it's gonna last

It's the love that lasts forever

It's the love that had no past



Don't let me down

Don't let me down

Don't let me down

Don't let me down



Don't let me down

Don't let me down



Yeahhhhh



Don't let me down

Baby baby don't you let me down

Don't let me down

Don't you let me down

don't you let me down

Oh no no no

Don't let me down

don't you let me down

Oh no no no

never never
