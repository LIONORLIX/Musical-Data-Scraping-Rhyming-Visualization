Helter Skelter


When I get to the bottom

I go back to the top of the slide

Where I stop and turn and I go for a ride

Till I get to the bottom and I see you again

Yeah, yeah, yeah

Do you, don't you want me to love him

I'm coming down fast but I'm miles above you

Tell me, tell me, tell me, come on tell me the answer

Well you may be a lover but you ain't no dancer



Look out

Helter skelter

Helter skelter

Helter skelter

Uhhhhh

Will you won't you want me to make you

I'm coming down fast but don't let me break you

Tell me, tell me, tell me, baby tell me the answer

You may be a lover but you ain't no dancer



Helter skelter

Helter skelter

Helter skelter

Uhhhh, ow



[Instrumental Interlude]



When I get to the bottom

I go back to the top of the slide

When I stop and turn and I go for a ride

And I get to the bottom and I see you again

Yeah, yeah, yeah



Well, do you gonna want me to make you

I'm coming down fast but don't let me break you

Well tell me, tell me, tell me the answer

You may be a lover but you ain't no dancer



Oh no,

Helter skelter

Helter skelter

Helter skelter

Uhhhh, ow
