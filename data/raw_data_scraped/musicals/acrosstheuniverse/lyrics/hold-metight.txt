Hold MeTight


It feels so right now

Hold me tight

Tell me I'm the only one

and then I might

Never be the lonely one so

Hold me tight tonight, tonight

It's you, you, you, you

Hold me tight

Let me go on loving you

tonight, tonight

Making love to only you so

Hold me tight tonight, tonight

It's you, you, you, you



Don't know what it means to hold you tight

being here alone tonight with you

It feels so right now

Hold me tight

Tell me I'm the only one

And then I might

never be the lonely one so

Hold me tight tonight, tonight

It's you, you, you, you



Don't know what it means to hold you tight

Being here alone tonight with you

It feels so right now

Hold me tight

Let me go on loving you

Tonight, tonight

Making love to only you, so

Hold me tight tonight, tonight

It's you, you, you, you
