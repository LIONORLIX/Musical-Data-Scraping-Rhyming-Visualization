All My Loving


Close your eyes and I'll kiss you,

Tomorrow I'll miss you;

Remember I'll always be true.

And then while I'm away,

I'll write home ev'ry day,

And I'll send all my lovin'to you.



I'll pretend that I'm kissing

The lips I am missing

And hope that my dreams will come true.

And then while I'm away,

I'll write home ev'ry day,

And I'll send all my lovin'to you.



All my lovin' I will send to you.

All my lovin' darling I'll be true.



Close your eyes and I'll kiss you,

Tomorrow I'll miss you;

Remember I'll always be true.

And then while I'm away,

I'll write home ev'ry day,

And I'll send all my lovin'to you.



All my lovin' I will send to you.

All my lovin' darling I'll be true.

All my lovin'

All my lovin'

All my lovin' I will send to you.
