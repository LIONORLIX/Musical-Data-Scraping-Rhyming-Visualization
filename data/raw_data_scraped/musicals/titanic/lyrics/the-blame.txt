The Blame


ISMAY

Surly something can be done to help us...



ANDREWS

Thousands on board

Trusting and warm

Roused from their sleep

Sent up above

Unsinkable ship

What she now?

What is she now?



ISMAY

Possibly she won't go down

Possibly she'll stay afloat

Possibly all this could come to an end

On a positive note...



ANDREWS

Not unless the ship could fly

Not unless we all sprout wings!

Honestly, sir, I have built her from scratch

And I know certain things!



ISMAY

If you know so much

Why didn't you know to prevent this!

What's to become of us all,

Now that providence sent this!

This is your work, Mr. Andrews!

You have done us in!

Where's her leakproof bulkheads?

Where's her double skin?

That's your job!

If someone must take the blame

It is you!

You!...



CAPT. SMITH

Innocent folk

Held in our care

Living their lives

Dreaming their dreams

Dreaming their dreams...



ISMAY

Possible a ship will come

Possibly we'll all be saved...



ANDREWS

Dammit, sir, listen!

We're hemorrhaging fast!

It's our hull that's been staved!



ISMAY

Couldn't you design it right?

Whoever heard of steel that rips?



ANDREWS

Ismay, I'm just in the business of building

It's God who sinks ships!...



ISMAY

There stands the Captain

Who sailed us straight into disaster!



ANDREWS

Oh, now it's the Captain's turn!

Pray, who urged him to go faster?...



Well, then, thank you, Mr. Ismay

For your contribution!

Now please pray for some

Miraculous solution!

Your timing is perfect!

Now help us, please

If you can!



CAPT. SMITH

Who called for speed and to break every record!

Who had to keep all the millionaires happy!



ISMAY

How dare you, Smith!

I will not stand here indicted!

Who ignored warnings of icebergs when sighted?



Who, sir, refused to extend up the bulheads?!



ANDREWS

You, sir! To give the first class

Bigger staterooms!



CAPT. SMITH

And who undermined the postion of Captain?



ISMAY

And who took a course too far north for the

Season?



CAPT. SMITH

And who kept insisting

We land ever sooner?...



ISMAY

And who should have posted        ANDREWS

More lookouts in darkness?!       And who had to have both

The largest and fastest?...

Who did?!



CAPT. SMITH

Who did it?!                      Who did it?!



ISMAY

Who did it?!                      Who did it?!



ALL THREE

Who did it?!

Who did it?!



ANDREWS

Possible the lord will act...



CAPT. SMITH

Possible He will provide...



ALL THREE

And indicate how

Our unthinkable fate

Can be somehow denied

Somehow denied...



ISMAY(To Andrews)

Your work

No one else's...



ANDREWS

My doing

No one else's...



CAPT. SMITH

There's only one Captain

And I was in charge...

This is my ship

No one else's...
