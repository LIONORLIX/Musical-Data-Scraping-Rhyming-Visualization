I Have Danced


ALICE BEANE

I have danced with the first class, Edgar

It was oh, such a dream come true!



EDGAR BEANE

That class isn't for our kind, Alice...



ALICE BEANE

That won't do!



There are hotels on islands, Edgar!

Great resorts on a sandy beach...



EDGAR BEANE

That's a world that's beyond our income

And our reach...



ALICE BEANE

Please don't tell me never

I'll want this forever...ever...



There's a new world around us, Edgar



EDGAR BEANE

Won't you ever give up that view?



ALICE BEANE

I want more than we've got now, Edgar

Why don't you?
