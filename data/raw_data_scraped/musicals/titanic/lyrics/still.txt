ISIDOR STRAUS

Still

The way I love you

Still

Lives in my heart



IDA STRAUS

After all of the years

We've been together



BOTH

Holding our love

Still...



ISIDOR STRAUS

The way you move me

Still

Feels as it did

When you first became mine

Whispered the words



BOTH

"I will"...

I loved you then

And I love you

Still



IDA STRAUS

No one else could play your role

Forever know my mind



ISIDOR STRAUS

True companion of my soul

I won't turn from

You I learn from

Still...



BOTH

Through fortune's changes

Still

Always we've been



ISIDOR STRAUS

That the promise we made...



BOTH

Kept us as one

And will!

I loved you then...

And I love you...

Still!
