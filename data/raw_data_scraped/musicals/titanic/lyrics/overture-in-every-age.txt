Overture In Every Age


ANDREWS

In every age mankind attempts

To fabricate great works

At once magnificent

And impossible...



On desert sands, from mountains of stone

A pyramid!

From flying buttresses alone

A wall of light!

A chapel ceiling

Screaming one man's ecstasy!

One man's ecstasy...



Miracles them all!

China's endless wall...

Stonehenge, The Parthenon, The Duomo

The aqueducts of Rome



We did not attempt to make

With mammoth blocks of stone

A giant pyramid

No, not a pyramid...

Nor gothic walls that radiate with light...



Our task was to dream upon

And then create

A floating city!

Floating city!...



A human metropolis...

A complete civilization!

Sleek!

And fast!

At once a poem

And the perfection

Of physical engineering...



At once a poem

And the perfection

Of physical engineering...
