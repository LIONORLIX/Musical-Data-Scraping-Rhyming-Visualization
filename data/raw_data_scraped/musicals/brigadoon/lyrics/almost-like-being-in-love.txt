Almost Like Being in Love


TOMMY:

Maybe the sun gave me the pow'r,

For I could swim Loch Lomond and be home in half an hour.

Maybe the air gave me the drive,

For I'm all aglow and alive.

What a day this has been! What a rare mood I'm in!

Why, it's almost like being in love!

There's a smile on my face for the whole human race!

Why, it's almost like being in love!

All the music of life seems to be like a bell that is ringing for me!

And from the way that I feel when that bell starts to peal,

I could swear I was falling, I would swear I was falling,

It's almost like being in love.

When we walked up the brae,



FIONA:

Not a word did we say,

It was...almost like bein' in love.

But your arm link'd in mine made the world kind o' fine.



TOMMY:

It was...almost like being in love!



FIONA:

All the music of life seems to be



TOMMY:

Like a bell that is ringing for me!



BOTH:

And from the way that I feel when that bell starts to peal,



FIONA:

I could swear I was fallin',



TOMMY:

I would swear I was falling,



BOTH:

It's almost like being in love!
