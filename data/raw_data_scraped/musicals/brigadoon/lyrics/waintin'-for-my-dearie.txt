Waintin' for My Dearie


FIONA:

Many a lassie as ev'ryone knows'll

Try to be married before twenty-five.

So she'll agree to most any proposal.

All he mus' be is a man, an' alive.

I hold a dream an' there's no compromisin'

I know there's one certain laddie for me.

One day he'll come walkin' o'er the horizon:

But should he not, then an old maid I'll be.

Foolish, ye may say.

Foolish I will stay.

Waitin' for my dearie, an' happy am I

to hold my heart till he comes strollin' by.

When he comes, my dearie, one look an' I'll know

That he's the dearie I've been wantin' so.

Though I'll live forty lives till the day he arrives,

I'll not ever, ever grieve.

For my hopes will be high that he'll come strollin' by;

For ye see, I believe

That there's a laddie weary, and wanderin' free,

Who's waitin' for his dearie:

Me!



1ST GIRL:

What do ye do while ye're waitin' around

For your lad to come your way?



FIONA:

Well, when no one is lookin', ye kneel on the ground,

An' ye pray an' pray an' pray!



2ND GIRL:

But when lassies sit an' have no men,

Oh, how long becomes the night.



FIONA:

But I fear the night is longer when the lad's no' right.

Waitin' for my dearie is sweeter to me

Than wooin' any laddie on the lea.



GIRLS:

Dreamin' of your dearie, an' idlin' the day



FIONA:

That's how I am an' how I'll ever stay.

Though I'll live forty lives till the day he arrives,

I'll not ever, ever grieve.

For my hopes will be high that he'll come strollin' by;

For ye see, I believe



FIONA AND GIRLS:

That there's a laddie weary, an' wanderin' free,

who's waitin' for his dearie:



FIONA:

Me!
