A Whole Lot Worse


(spoken) Honey, you wanna know about bad?



When I was a young girl

'Bout the age of one

I shot up my crib

With a BB gun

I never behaved

Never followed no rules

They kicked me out of my nursery school!



Every year for Mother's Day I'd steal my mother's purse

(She steals her mother's purse)

So if you wanna be bad

You're gonna have to do a whole lot worse



My whole life long

I've been called a disgrace

I can hold up a bank

Using only my face

I'm the nastiest creature

You ever did see

On Halloween I dress up as me!



One look my way could make an angry mob disperse

(Make that mob disperse)

So if you wanna be bad

You're gonna have to do a whole lot worse

(A whole lot worse)



You're so squeaky clean

You're so spic and span

You never litter

Or loiter

Or drink from a can!



So when you start bragging 'bout your wicked life

We're like switchblades laughing a butter knife



My body's a paradise

Of swivels and curves

Ever since I was twelve

I've been a magnet for perves

One day the Oscar Mayer man

Tried to cop a feel

I climbed up and stabbed him in his weinermobile!



I nearly turned that hotdog into a hearse

(A hotdog into a hearse)



So do you wanna be bad?

Or mean?

Or plain perverse?



(spoken) Yeah!



If you wanna be bad

You're gonna have to do a whole lot worse

(Yeahhh)



It takes years to be bad

It ain't no passing fad

It takes commitment and time to master petty crime



So if you want your degree

In delinquency

You're gonna have to be...



A whole hell of a lot worse!
