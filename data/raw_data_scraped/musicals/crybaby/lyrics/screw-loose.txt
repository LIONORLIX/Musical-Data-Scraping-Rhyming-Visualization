Screw Loose


LENORA

Screw loose

That's what they say I've got

Or maybe they say I'm not

Playing with a full deck

But hey!

What the heck! Can I do-oo-oo?

Baby, I've got a screw loose for you



Bonkers

That's what they're calling me

Not metaphorically

They mean truly insane

But they can't hear the voice in my brai-ai-ai-ain

Giving orders to keep loving you



Eccentric

Erratic

toys in the bellfree

bats in the attic

But I just don't see the harm

In carving your name in my a-arm



Nee-nee-ow (the whole melody)



Darling

It's so-o

Hard to be sixteen and schitzo

But I know it's worth the cost

I made up my mind which I have lo-ost

*very breathy oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh*



Screw loose

Clinically certified

A panel of doctors try

To lock my away

But until that day when they finally do-oo-



"I know! Leave me alone! Gosh."



I am here if you need a loo-oose screw
