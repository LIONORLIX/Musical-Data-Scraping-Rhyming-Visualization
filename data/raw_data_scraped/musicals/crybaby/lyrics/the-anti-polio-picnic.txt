The Anti-Polio Picnic


It's a beautiful day for an anti-polio picnic! Picnic!

It's a beautiful day to get a polio shot!

A brave new world's in store,

for picturesque (Closemore  NOT SURE?!?) , Baltimore



(Spoken) And if you value the use of your legs,

you came to the right spot



What a wonderful time to be a teenage conformist! (conformist!)

What a wonderful time to be what's known as a square (We are square!)

We're lucky to be us,

so happy and homogen-eous



(Spoken) But still one must take care for danger's lurking

(ALL)EVERYWHERE!



(Spoken) What we know Miss VW is you can't be too careful



We watch for communists

Keep tabs on UFOs

Steer clear of weirdos,

And Beardos

and Pinkos

And cloth heads, God only knows!



We frown on (potty mouth - NOT SURE?!?)

We don't wear skimpy hoes (No! No!)

We avoid all temptation

We fight our insurgents

We repress all our lustful and primitive urges



(Spoken) And now in his iron lung is the mascot of our carnival

and Baltimore's polio poster boy of the year, Ray (long last name)



(Spoken) Thanks everybody, I sure wish I could have got that shot (referring to an Anti-Polio Shot)



So run right along to the Anti-Polio Picnic (Anti-Polio Picnic!)

Come on along and protect yourself from disease (ow...Disease!)

You're going to be right just do what you're told and tow the line

You got to watch your step in times like these...

You got to watch your step in times like these....



(screaming & shouting)
