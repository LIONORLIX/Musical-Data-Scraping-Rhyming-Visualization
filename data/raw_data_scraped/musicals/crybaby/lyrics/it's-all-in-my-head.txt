It's All in My Head


BALDWIN

Your marrying the guy I hate



LENORA

And your marrying the girl I hate



BALDWIN/LENORA

It's so beautiful!



BALDWIN

I've got a girl who loves me so

And happiness is all we know

We're so happy

And soon we'll be wed

soon we'll be wed



LENORA

I've got a boy, I love him so

I'm never gonna let him go

Cause he loves me-



BALDWIN(spoken)

Really? Because I've seen you two-



LENORA

He loves me!

That's what he said



BALDWIN/LENORA

I can see it so clearly,

It's all in my head



BALDWIN

By and by will settle down

In some un-ethnic part of town

I'll make money



ALLISON

la la la la la



BALDWIN

But you'll make the bread

Get it? Bread!



ALLISON(spoken)

That's genuinely funny!



LENORA

Will live inside a tin roofed shack

With 7 chimpanzees out back

And a ant farm-



CRY BABY

bum dum dum dum dum



LENORA

Under the bed



CRY BABY(spoken)

Well that doesn't sound crazy at all!



BALDWIN/LENORA

I can see it so clearly

It's all in my head



LENORA

He'll tattoo my name on his triceps



BALDWIN

Oh! I'll wrap her in red, white, and blue



CRY BABY/ALLISON

Yes every detail, of the life you've imagined

Is finally gonna come true



BALDWIN

I can see it so clearly



LENORA

clearly, clearly, clearly, clearly



BALDWIN

I can see it so clearly



LENORA

La, La, La, La, La, La, La, La



COMPANY

Ahhhhh



ALLISON/GIRL ENSEMBLE

I find you extremely physically attractive



BALDWIN/BOY ENSEMBLE

Your theories on space zombies make sense to me



COMPANY

Ahhh, were so happy



BALDWIN/LENORA

It's all in my head



COMPANY

Everything's going to be perfect

Life will go skipping along

Will spend eternity living in harmony



BALDWIN/LENORA(spoke)

No



COMPANY

Harmony



BALDWIN/LENORA

No



COMPANY

Harmony



BALDWIN/LENORA(spoke)

Yeah! That's it!



COMPANY

Singing a beautiful song

Ahhhhhhh



CRY BABY/ALLISON

I must go now my sweet one and only

Every pray to begin life anew

Soon every detail of the lie you've imagined

Is finally gonna come true!



LENORA

For love is pure



BALDWIN

And love is clear



LENORA

And love is all that's left up here!



BALDWIN/LENORA

And they snicker, that romance is dead!



BALDWIN

I can see it so clearly



LENORA

I can see it so clearly



BALDWIN/LENORA

Can't you see it so clearly?

Sure I can!

It's all in my head!
