I Did Something Wrong...Once


I am of the opinion that morals

Are what separate humans from swine.

Everyone needs to have morals

Specifically mine.



It's one's duty to set an example

And to always comport oneself decently

A worthy endeavor at which I failed NEVER!

Well, not recently.



For you see...



I did something wrong, once

One tiny thing wrong, once

A small indiscretion

A minor transgression

I blundered a tad

Told a little white lie

Just a scooch off the truth

But it did lead to heartache

And that was...uncouth



Yes, I did something wrong, once

One teensy thing wrong, once

It was somewhat unseemly

Not somewhat extremely

And rather lowbrow

Yes, I confess, I did something wrong, once

Is it too late to make it right now?



My life overall has been blameless

As I scan it few faults do I find

Why even those three months with Hitler...

Never mind



The point is I've been through my closet

And that closet has only one skeleton

One breach of decorum waiting a forum

To tell it in



For I did something wrong, once

One itsy bitsy thing wrong, once

Showed a slight lack of candor

All right it was slander

All right it was bad

It was shameful, amoral

Disgraceful, unlawful

Look, I'll be blunt

It was just friggin' awful



Yes, I did something wrong, once

Just egregiously wrong, once

You may think I'm self-righteous

The truth is I might just be

Un-holier-than-thou

Okay, once might say

I did something wrong once

But perhaps I can make it right now



I wrestled with my conscience

For it knew that I had sinned

I wrestled with my conscience

I got pinned! I got pinned!



Now I'm haunted with the memories

Of the pain I put people through

I'm haunted by the memories

They say boo, they say boo, they say booooooooo



I'm regrettably of the opinion

That I've not merely broken the law

But in causing the death of two innocent people

And thus leaving their son as an orphan who lives in a bottomless cesspool of stigma

I've made a faux pas



All my life I've been seen as a beacon

High society's shining epitome

But now the opinions of matrons and minions

Mean shit to me



Yes, I did something wrong, once

Just repulsively wrong, once

But I'm tired of seeing

This stain on my being

It's driving me mad!

So today I'm off on a mission

I call it Operation Contrition

And I'm making this vow

I'll complete it somehow



This is it

I admit I did something wrong, once

But I'm going to right it

Right now
