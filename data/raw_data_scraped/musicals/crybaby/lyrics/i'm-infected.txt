I'm Infected


ALLISON

I suffered through the measles

I made it through the mumps

Chicken pox's was nothing

I nicknamed all bumps



But now my palms sweaty

And my tickers skipping thumps

My skin is turning green

My thoughts are so  unclean

I think cupid slipped a mickie in my polio-vaccine



I'm infected, I'm infected

With these feelings that you've injected

In my arm and in my heart

Feeling in every body part

Baby I'm infected with your love

Baby I'm infected with your love



CRY BABY

Ain't never seen no doctor

Ain't never take you sick

One time I had the stab wound

A band aid did the trick



I'm the type who suffers

On some tiny little prick

But this tenderness I feel

Is painful, and its real

My soul just gotta boo-boo

And no wowie pop can heal



I'm infected, I'm infected

With these feelings that you've injected

Now your pulsing through each vein

And your pounding in my brain

Oh Baby, I'm infected with your love

Baby I'm infected with your love



ALLISON

Now I'm yearning



CRY BABY

And I'm burning



ALLISON

And am I sighing



CRY BABY

And I'm moaning



ALLISON

Could it be the greases monkeys

That the vaccine was groaning



ALLISON/CRY BABY

Whatever you've shot into me

I need another dose



CRY BABY

Wait!

Did you say greases monkeys

Man, thats gross...



ALLISON/CRY BABY

That's gross!



ALLISON/CRY BABY

Were infected!

Were infected!

Lets take this love

Only as directed



It's much worse diagnosis

Then mononucleosis

But it feels so much better than I ever expected



MRS. VERNON-WILLIAMS

Allison!



CRYBABY

I've never felt so queezy

I've never felt so high

I'm getting from a vision

From an angel so divine

No matter what I've gotta do

I'm gonna make her mine

I'm infected, I'm infected

Oh baby! I'm infected with your love
