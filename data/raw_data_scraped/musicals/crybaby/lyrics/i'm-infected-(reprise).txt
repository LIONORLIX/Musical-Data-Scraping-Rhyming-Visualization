I'm Infected (Reprise)


Allison:



Now I'm burning,

and I'm yearning,

and I'm longing,

and I'm lusting



My thoughts have gone from dirty to truly disgusting



In my every treasure,

he can break my every lock

He can go under my shirt,

over my bra, my bra!



I'm infecting,

I'm infecting,

have a fever thats unconnected



From that one kiss I can tell,

I feel much worse feeling well

Cry Baby I'm infected with your love,

Cry Baby I'm infected with your love



[Thanks to Anabella for lyrics]
