You Can't Beat the System


You can't beat the system

(You can't beat the system)

No, you can't beat the system

(You can't beat the system)



They chain ya, detain ya, restrict ya and restrain ya

They rented special shackles from the state of Pennsylvania

Don't bother with the facts because they're always gonna twist 'em

No matter what you do you know you can't beat the system



Life is a trumped up charge

Life is a trumped up charge!

I'm just another sap

Too dumb to beat their rap

The one way I'm a felon

Is I fell into their trap

The world's the one that did it

But the world is still at large

Life is a trumped up charge



We didn't set no fire

I said, we didn't set no fire!

Let me briefly state my case

I was busy sucking face

I was going for a triple but got stuck at second base

I was over at the quarry swinging naked from a tire

We didn't set no fire



Love is his alibi

I said, love is his alibi!

I can place him at my scene

If you know what I mean

He was with me from approximately six to twelve fifteen

If you call me as a witness I will gladly testify

Love is his alibi



They'll nail ya, they'll jail ya,

They'll say that you're a failure



We certainly appear to have you by the genitalia!



They'll charge you with resistance even if you don't resist 'em

No matter what you do you know

You can't beat the system!

(You can't beat the system)

No you can't beat the system!

(no, no, no, no, no, no, no)

You'll mock it, you'll knock it,

You'll kick and shake and shock it



How dare you come before this court and desecrate my docket!

But there will soon be justice here 'cause you're about to see

You're looking at the system

And you can't beat me.
