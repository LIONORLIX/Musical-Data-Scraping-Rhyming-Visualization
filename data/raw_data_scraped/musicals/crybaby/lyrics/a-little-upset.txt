A Little Upset


[Cry-Baby]

I’m just a little upset

I don’t mean to be rude

I’d hate to have my fury at the world be misconstrued

Just feel kinda bad

Ever so sad

I get that way when they take my girl and fry my mum and dad

But if you see me fuss and fret

Please don’t take it as a threat

It’s just sometimes I get a little upset



Yeah, I’ll just settle myself down a bit



Actually...

I’m still a little upset

Just a little bit irked

That this entire world around which I am getting jerked

I guess that I’m not

Feelin’ so hot

I must’ve woke up on the wrong side of my rat-infested cot

How profoundly I regret

This entire tete-a-tete

It’s just sometimes I get a little upset



[Dupree]

‘Scuse me officer

I hate to bother you but



I’m also a little upset

Like my friend over here

A decade in the slammer isn’t great for my career

Good thing I’m mature

You can be sure

This is nothing that a full-scale prison riot wouldn’t cure

Now I’ve gone and broke a sweat

That’s what happens when you let

Yourself gradually get a little upset



I’m tryin’ to stay positive

I’m tryin’ not to frown

And I’m positive I’d smile if I could tear this prison down



[Cry-Baby]

You say I’ll get out early

If I show you some repentance

But I ain’t never been too good at finishing a...



[Prisoners]

We’re just a little upset

Sounds hard to believe

But unjust incarceration is our number one pet peeve



[Guards]

Don’t take it so hard

We’re standing guard

We wouldn’t want this place to leave you permanently scarred



[Cry-Baby]

From the moment that we met

I’ve been deeply in your debt

For your patience for when I get a little upset



[Cry-Baby, Dupree and prisoners]

Because brother you can bet

That you ain’t seen nothin’ yet

We’re about to pitch a fit

And by the time we’re through with it

You’ll be more than just a lit-tle upset



[Cry-Baby]

Oh-oh-oh-oh

oh-oh-oh

Carpe diem not incarceratum

Let’s escape our metal Dupree

... turn ‘em in Alcatraz



[Dupree]

No way
