Misery, Agony, Helplessness, Hopelessness, Heartache and Woe


ALLISON

I had a love, but love left me lonely

I had a love, but now I have only

misery, agony, helplessness hopelessness heartache and woe... woah woah woah



You can see by my tears, the tears I've lost count of,

You can see by my tears the ungodly amount of

misery, agony, helplessness hopelessness heartache and woe... woah woah woah woah!



I see no future for us, which means I see no relief,

from the suffering, sorrow, despair, despondence, torment, and grief



It's hard, oh so hard, to be an adolescent

the braces, the zits, and now this incessant,

misery, agony, helplessness hopelessness heartache and woe... woah woah woah woah



CRY-BABY

Locked in a cage, staring at the ceiling

locked in a cage, doin' nothing but feeling

misery, agony, helplessness hopelessness heartache and woe... woah woah woah



All kinds of hurt fill my soul as I languish

distress and despair, abjection and anguish,

also Misery, agony, helplessness hopelessness heartache and woe... woah woah woah woah



But when I dream of my darlin' waiting there for me

I feel happiness, pleasure, contentment, serenity, joy bliss and glee.



She's up in her room



ALLISON

Hopelessness



BOTH

Heartache and woe... woah woah woah woah

Dejection depression diaspora doubtfulness helplessness hopelessness heartache and woe...woah woah woah woah



bleakness and weakness, listlessness lassitude, helplessness hopelessness heartache and woe...woah woah woah woah



(inconsolable grief)

Woah woah woah woah



(May as well jump off a bridge)

Woah woah woah woah



(Life is lonely and sad)

woah woah woah woah
