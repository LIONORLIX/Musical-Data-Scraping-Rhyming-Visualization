Thanks for the Nifty Country!


Wiffles! Forward! Sing!



We've got a message for the founders

This Independence Day

Thanks for the nifty country!

Because if it were not for you

We'd be just the S of A

So, thanks for the nifty country



You took a noble stance

You bravely stood your ground

Yes, when it came to founding

You sure knew how to found

'Cause we grew into the best-est global superpower around

So thanks for the nifty country



Thanks for the dandy declaration

That finally set us free

From a king so cruel and evil

He raised the price of tea

It took a lot of courage

To fight the mighty British

But Washington you weren't even skittish



Thanks for our cuddly Constitution

That's ever so complex

Full of bouncy little balances

And cheeky little checks

Its got lots of swell amendments

That guarantee our freedom

It's nice to know they're there in case we need 'em



We the peppy do ordain and establish this theme park as Star-Spangled Fun Land



So everybody join us

On this July the Fourth

And say thanks for the nifty country

From the good folks in the South

To their conquerors the North

We say thanks for the nifty country



And wouldn't it be swell

If we grew up some day

To give the gift of freedom to a people far away

They'd shower us with flowers

Bring us unicorns and say (Hey!)

Thanks for the nifty country



Thanks!
