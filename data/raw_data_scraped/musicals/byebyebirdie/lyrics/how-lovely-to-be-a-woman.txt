How Lovely to Be a Woman


Kim:

When you're a skinny child of fourteen,

Wired with braces from ear to ear,

You doubt that you could ever be appealing...



The hallelujah! You are fifteen,

And the braces disappear,

And your skin is smooth and clear,

And you have that happy, grown-up, female feeling!



How lovely to be a woman,

The wait was well worthwhile,

How lovely to wear mascara,

And smile a woman's smile.



How lovely to have a figure

That's round instead of flat,

Whenever you hear boys whistle,

You're what they're whistling at!



It's wonderful to feel

The way a woman feels,

It gives you such a glow,

Just to know,

You're wearing lipstick and heels.



How lovely to be a woman,

And have one job to do:

To pick out a boy and train him,

And then when you are through,

You've made him the man you want him to be...

Life's lovely when you're a woman ike me!



How wonderful to know

The things a woman knows!

How marvelous to wait

For a date

In simply beautiful clothes!



How lovely to be a woman,

And change from boys to men,

And go to a fancy night club,

And stay out after ten!

How lovely to be so grown-up and free!

Life's lovely when you're a woman like me!
