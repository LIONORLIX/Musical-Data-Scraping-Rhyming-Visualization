Put on a Happy Face


Albert:



Gray skies are gonna clear up,

Put on a happy face!

Brush off the clouds and cheer up,

Put on a happy face!



Take off that gloomy mask of tragedy,

It's not your style.

You'll look so good that you'll be glad ya decided to smile!



Pick out a pleasant outlook,

Stick out that noble chin,

Wipe off that full-of-doubt look,

Slap on a happy grin!



And spread sunshine all over the place, just

Put on a happy face!



Put on a happy face!



Put on a happy face!



And if you're feeling cross and bickerish

Don't sit and whine.

Think of banana splits and licorice,

And you'll feel fine!



I knew a girl so gloomy,

She'd never laugh or sing,

SHe wouldn't listen to me,

Now she's a mean old thing!



So spread sunshine all over the place, just

Put on a happy face!
