Honestly Sincere


Girl:

Speak to us, oh beautiful one, tell us how you make that

glorious sound, that even now an anticipation of it has

reduced me to a snarling, raging, panting, jungle beast!

Birdie:

You gotta be sincere!

You gotta be sincere!

You gotta feel it here,

'Cause if you feel it here,

Well, then you're gonna be honestly sincere!

If what you feel is true,

You really feel it you

Make them feel it too,

Write this down now

You gotta be sincere,

Honestly sincere!

Man, you've got to be sincere!

If you're really sincere,

If you're really sincere,

If you feel it in here

Then it's gotta be right!

Oh, baby! Oh, honey!

Hug me! Suffer!

In ev'rything I do,

My sincerity shows thro'

I looked you in the eye,

Don't even have to try,

It's automatic!

I'm sincere!

When I sing about a tree,

I really feel that tree!

When I sing about a girl,

I really feel that girl,

I mean I really feel sincere!

If you're really sincere!

If you're really sincere!

If you feel it in here,

Then it's gotta be right!

Oh, baby! Oh, honey!

Hug me! Suffer!

You gotta be sincere!

Oh oh, you gotta feel it here!

Oh, my baby, oh, my baby, oh yeah!

Oh, my baby, oh yeah!

Well, you gotta be sincere!

Well, you gotta be sincere!

Well, you gotta be sincere!

Well, you gotta be sincere!

Well, you gotta be sincere!

Well, you gotta be sincere!

Oh, my baby, oh yeah!

Oh, my baby, oh yeah!

Well, you gotta be sincere!

Well, you gotta be sincere!

Oh, my baby, oh yeah!

Oh, my baby, oh yeah!

Oh, my baby, oh yeah!

Oh, my baby, oh yeah!

Yeah, YEAH!
