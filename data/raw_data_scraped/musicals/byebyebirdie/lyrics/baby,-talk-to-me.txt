Baby, Talk to Me


Albert:

Talk To me, baby, won't you talk to me

I don't care what you say

Baby, talk to me

Must you to be oh so far away from me

It seems so wrong this way

Talk to me

And if you miss me

Tell me so

Are you lonely

Tell me so

Say you love me

Tell me so

Honey, let me know

Talk to me

Till I press you close to me

Then you'll see

We won't have to talk at all

(Must you to be oh so far away from me, baby)

I don't care what you say

(Oh, baby talk)

Talk to me

(Go on, what can you loose, it ain't gonna hurt)

And if you miss me

(Oooh, Tell him so)

Are you lonely

(Lady, lady, tell him so)

Say you love me

(Oooh!)

Tell me so

(Honey, honey)

Let me know

Chorus:

Talk to me

Till I press you close to me

Then you'll see

We won't have to talk at all

Till I press you close to me

Then you'll see

We won't have to talk at all

Talk to me

Talk to me

Talk to me...
