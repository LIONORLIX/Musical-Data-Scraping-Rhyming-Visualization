Spanish Rose


Rosie:

I'm just a Spanish tamale according to Mae

Right off the boat from the tropics far far away

Which is kind of funny

Since where I come from is Allentown, Pa

Spanish!

Ok, may I'll be Spanish

Right after I've married Alberto



I'll be the toast of chi-chi Costanango,

And all day long my castanets will click!

I'll hide behind my fan and do the tango!

I'll be so Spanish it'll make you sick!

I'll eat the tacos and the enchilada!

I'll drink Tequila till I feel no pain!

The only song I'll sing will be "Granada"!

I'll be more "espa?ol" than Abbe Lane!



Coo coo coo

La cuc.........racha

Ssssso

Call me the wild Spanish rose!

The craziest flower that grows

I'll kick up my heels and see

How it feels to be sultry Spanish rose

Ol?!



Behind my mantilla I will pose

The beauty that nobody knows!

So regal and cool, exciting and cruel,

That's me! Spanish rose



(My name Rosita Hernandez!)

(You'll buy my "tortilla"!)

(You like me, yes? No? Maybe? "Eeyuckh!")



"Americano" let me give you a bit of advice

To cross Spanish do not twice

Your match you have found

So don't mess around

Her heart is cold as ice!



With Albert I will dance to the bolero

We'll cha cha in the nicest honky tonks

Hell wear a little mustache and sombrero

My handsome Latin lover from the Bronx



So now that you've met Spanish rose

Never forget Spanish rose

Shell taunt you,

Shell tame you but what man can blame you

For worshiping Spanish rose.



Not Danish

Not British

Not Swedish

Not Yiddish

But span............................ish

Rosa!
