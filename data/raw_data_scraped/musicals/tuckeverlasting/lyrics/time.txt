Time


Miles:

I had a farm house with a grandfather clock

Where I would teach time to my son

Our lessons began at twelve o'clock sharp

When the hands would come in as one



I'd say the big hand counts minutes

It's so tightly wound

It chases the small hand

To make hours go round



I taught Thomas constellations in the sky

To tell a silver maple from a cotton wood

I taught Thomas to divide and multiply

But one he never understood was time



As I watched him grow, time

He would never know time

For my regret resides time

If I only knew the what and how and who

That time truly divides



There was a farmhouse with a grandfather clock

Where one day I woke up alone

They feared I was magic

They feared I was cursed

But mostly they feared the unknown



The big hands the father

The small hands the son

And there never came a time

When they came back as one



I taught Thomas how to catch a firefly

How to make a pebble skip and rowboat skim

She took Thomas and never said goodbye

The one thing I could never give to him



Was time, time

I'm left with nothing

Nothing but time



Winnie:

Miles, I don't have a father anymore



Miles:

You don't?



Winnie:

No. But i will always love him. For the rest of my life.

And I promise Thomas will love you for the rest of his.
