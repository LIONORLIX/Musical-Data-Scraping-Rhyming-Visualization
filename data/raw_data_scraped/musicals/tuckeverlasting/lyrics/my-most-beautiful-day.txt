My Most Beautiful Day


(MAE):

Every grown woman

who stands at a mirror

remembers one beautiful day



every girl past her prime

knows the date and the time

she looked most exquisite

and she will revisit, revisit, revisit that day



her most beautiful day

for the rest of her life



my most beautiful day

pa took me dancing

everything fell into place



my hair tied like so

with a blackberry bow

a night in november

that i will remember, remember, remember that day



my most beautiful day

for the rest of my life



each memory

a sweet melody

the heart clings to

each passing day

what time takes away

the heart makes new

looking back

looking back is something to look forward to



your most beautiful day

for the rest of your life



love unlike beauty

or dresses

or dances

won't wrinkle or thicken with time



to be loved you will learn

is to love in return

find someone you care for



and winnie prepare for

prepare for, prepare for that day



your most beautiful day, for the rest of your life



your most beautiful day

for the rest of your

life
