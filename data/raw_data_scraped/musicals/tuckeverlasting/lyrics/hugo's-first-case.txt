Hugo's First Case


Hugo:

Big Day, first case.

Girl's gone, no trace.

Small town, no crime,

Now Treegap's hit the big time.



What's this? Fresh tracks.

Who's there? Relax.

Footprints, size 9.

A clue, yahoo! Nope, those are mine.



No dirty deed goes exactly as planned,

Look that's what it says in my deputy handbook.

Even the best crook, leaves you a clue.



Big Day, first case, girl's gone, no trace.

Hugo, you know what to do.



Constable Joe [spoken]:

Hugo! There you are.

This being your first missing persons case,

I recommend you keep your eyes open and your mouth closed.



[Thanks to Lizzie C, Olivia C, Ella for lyrics]





A New Broadway Musical (2016)

Tuck Everlasting the Musical - Hugo's First Case - Pt. 2 Lyrics



Song from the musical 'Tuck Everlasting' performed by Michael Wartella (Hugo).



Hugo:

House call

Adjourned

Leave no stone unturned

Flip here

Flip there

These flipping thins are everywhere...

Don't give up now, search cranny and nook

That's what it says in my deputy handbook

[pulling things from his bag frantically]

No that's not it, no that's my lunch

Where could it be?

Big day

Who took

Young girl

My book

Hugo-



Constable Joe [spoken]:

Hugo!

Get a clue and let's get on with it



Hugo [softly]:

Will you make deputy...
