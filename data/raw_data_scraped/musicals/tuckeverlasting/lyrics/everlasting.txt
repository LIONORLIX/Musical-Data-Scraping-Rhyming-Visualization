Everlasting


WINNIE:

There are two ways home down one long road:

One clear path to two conclusions.

Does the story end or never end?

Does the secret fade?

Or is it everlasting?



I could return to my mother like nothing has happened.

Live like an imposter for six long years,

Turn seventeen, then good girl Winnie Foster

Drinks from a vial and her past

Disappears.



There are two ways home down one long road:

One clear path to two conclusions.

Does the story end or never end?

Does the secret fade?

Or is it everlasting?



Or I put the Tucks behind me

And pull up the anchor.

Ride the wheel of plenty for all that it's worth.

Turn seventeen, then eighteen, then twenty,

For a life is the greatest wonder on earth.



Can I, should I, do I drink?

Can I, should I, will I drink?



There are two ways home down one long road:

One clear path to two conclusions.

Does the story end or never end?

Does the secret fade?

Or is it everlasting?



Is it everlasting?
