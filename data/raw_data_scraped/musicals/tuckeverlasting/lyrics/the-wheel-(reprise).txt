The Wheel (Reprise)


May:

Winnie Foster Jackson

Cherished wife

Devoted mother

Dearest grandmother



Angus:

Expert fishermen



Miles:

Looks like she led the life we never could



May:

May she rest in peace



Jesse:

It's a wheel

Winnie, a ripple in water



All:

Girl to wife to mother to daughter

Like all your kinfolk

Come and gone

Can't stop rowing, growing, changing

Then moving on

Moving On

Moving on

Moving on



Ensemble:

Hay na na Hay na na

Hey nah na
