Partner in Crime


JESSE:

The Pyramids, The Brooklyn Bridge,

The Rio Grande, The Rhine

I've seen the seven wonders of the world...

Can't wait for eight and nine

But because of my predicament,

My peculiar situation

To keep my profile low, low, low

I'm a one man operation



WINNIE:

Jesse! I've got it!

You need a partner in crime

Someone to share in the view

Why see all of the world and all of its glories

Without a friend to tell your stories to?



JESSE:

Someone to stand at my side

Two extra fists In a fight!

Why should the road be long and lonely?



WINNIE:

Why not team up?



BOTH:

We've only got tonight!



JESSE:

If no one's there to hear it,

does a falling tree make sound?



WINNIE:

Are we heard or seen or anything

without a friend around?



JESSE:

The old Great Wall, the Taj Mahal,

yes, they all have merit



WINNIE:

But this traveling fair could take the cake

because you get to share it!



JESSE:

Carrot?



WINNIE (with Jesse):

You need a partner in crime (I need a partner in crime)

Someone to share in a laugh (someone to share in a laugh)

Running a race without a pace setter



JESSE:

I'm out of place



BOTH:

Without my better half!



WINNIE:

With you



JESSE:

The fun is two-for-one



WINNIE:

And a choc full of surprises!

With you the line moves twice as fast



BOTH:

And no one realizes



JESSE:

To do whatever we do now will merit reminiscing



BOTH:

With two I finally feel somehow

that something isn't missing



BOTH (with ensemble):

I have a partner in crime (a partner in crime)

someone to share in the view



ALL:

Why see the world and all of its glories

without a friend to tell your stories to?



ENSEMBLE:

Last night for fun at the fair

Sun's setting

Tomorrow we're gone



ALL:

You need a partner, a partner in crime

Two extra fists in a fight

Stuck in a sticky situation?

Lucky the trick's collaboration

Why should the road be long and lonely?



JESSE & WINNIE:

We've only got tonight!



ENSEMBLE:

Last night for fun at the fair



JESSE & WINNIE:

A partner in crime!



ENSEMBLE:

Sun's setting

Tomorrow we're gone



ALL:

My partner in crime!
