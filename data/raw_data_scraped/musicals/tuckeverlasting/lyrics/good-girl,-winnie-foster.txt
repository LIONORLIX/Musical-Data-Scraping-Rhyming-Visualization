Good Girl, Winnie Foster


Winnie:

I’m trapped in a house so sad and lonely

On a street named Main,

But you could call it Only.

Is it rude to say I’d volunteer

For a day of fun just once a year.

I’d fly the coop, if only I could.

But I’ve got a really bad case of being good.



I’d go find trouble,

if there was some to get in.

Ask a friend to play,

If I had one to let in.

Nana’s rocker’s sawing through the floor

Every day like the one before,

We lock ourselves behind that door.

Is it wrong to wish for something more?



[Frog croaking]



[Spoken]

Winnie’s Mother:  Winne why did your dress just croak?

Winnie: Meet my new friend Toad!

I found him by the fence.

Winnie’s Mother: Winnie you know better than that!

Take that filthy thing outside where it belongs.

Winnie: Yes mother.



Winnie:

Good girl Winnie Foster, every day,

Is in bed at seven

Good girl Winnie Foster, every day,

Is a well behaved eleven

But some days,

I wanna raise,

A little something more than heaven.



[spoken]

Well Toad, we blew it.

But at least it got us out of the house.



Are you from the wood?

I’m not allowed there.

Big news, I know.

I’m not allowed anywhere.

Now here’s your chance to disappear

Go have fun, I’ll be right here.

Tied to a string, like a precious pearl

It's a pretty tight leash for a really good girl

Good girl Winnie Foster, every day,                     Winnie’s Mother, Nana, & Chorus:

.                                                                    [overlapping and echoing]Winnie

Is in bed at seven                                                      Come inside!

Good girl Winnie Foster, every day,                               Winnie

Is a well behaved eleven                                             Come inside!

But some days,                                                          Winnie

I wanna raise,

A little something more than heaven.



Some days,

I wanna raise,

A little something more than heaven
