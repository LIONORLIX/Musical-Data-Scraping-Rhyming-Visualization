Everything’s Golden


The Man in the Yellow Suit:

(spoken) It's water and it's in the wood! (Laughs)



(sung) Look who has a spring in his step

It's true there's a bounce in each toe

This has-been feels young again

Just when he was used to feeling old



Fella, take a look at my suit

Yellow has acquired a glow

Fleabags can laugh and joke

These rags will be spinning into gold



Golden like the sun rising in the east

Golden with that brand new day shine - hey!

Golden like the years it took to get me here

Soon everything's golden and everything's mine!



(Spoken) Soon,

I'm gonna be the richest son of a gun there ever was!

(Carnies laugh)

Who wouldn't pay a fortune for a sip of forever?



(Sung) Nutshell: when the water is mine

Don't tell me you wouldn't buy

My merchandise! I'll name the price

And make a killing making sure you will never die.



My purpose, my plan, my whole raison d'être:

Strike it rich, rule the world, et cetera, et cetera!

And of course become immortal somewhere 'long the way!

I'll be -



Carnies:

Golden like the sun!



The Man in the Yellow Suit:

Oh, golden like my suit

Golden with that brand new day shine



Carnies:

Brand new day shine!



The Man in the Yellow Suit:

Hey! Golden like the years it took to get me here

Soon -



The Man in the Yellow Suit and Carnies:

Everything's golden!



The Man in the Yellow Suit:

And everything's mine! (Spoken) C'mon, ladies.

One last dance before I make my millions!



(Dance break)



Carnies:

Everything's golden!



The Man in the Yellow Suit:

Golden like the sun!



Carnies:

Everything's golden!



The Man in the Yellow Suit:

Golden like my suit!



Carnies:

Everything's golden!



The Man in the Yellow Suit:

Golden like that brand new day shine!



Carnies:

Everything's golden! Everything's golden!



The Man in the Yellow Suit:

Golden like the years it took to get me here

Soon everything's golden (spoken) Say it!



Carnies:

Everything's golden!



The Man in the Yellow Suit:

Everything's golden!

And everything's -



Carnies:

Mine!



The Man in the Yellow Suit:

Everything's -



Carnies:

Mine!



The Man in the Yellow Suit:

Everything's... MINE!
