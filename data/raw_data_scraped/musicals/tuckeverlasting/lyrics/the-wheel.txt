The Wheel


I bet you didn’t know that the sun took a shine water

She drinks up a bit but floats it up to the sky

Now what she takes from our lake

will make her a storm cloud that rumbles and tumbles rain

From up high, high, high



It’s a wheel Winnie

This journey of ours

Sun to lake to cloud that showers rain back to the lake below

And you’ll ride that wheel wherever you go



Not a minute or moment is the same

The wheel keeps you guessing

And everything around you is along for the ride

The pond, the bullfrogs, the birch trees,

And hound dogs plus people, all people ebb and flow

With the tide, tide, tide,



It’s a wheel Winnie

A ripple in water

Girl to wife to mother to daughter

Like all you kinfolk

Come and gone

Can’t stop growing, rowing, changing then moving on



Once you drop an anchor,

The boat gets stuck and it could stay forever

Just floating on top

Watching life pass it by             Watching life pass it by

Just floating up top                  Just floating up top

That’s what us tucks are

Just floating stuck

Show me how to climb back on the wheel

I’d be there slick as a slingshot

Prepare to get off at the end

And share with someone my spot

You can’t have living without dying

so you can’t call this living what we got



We just are

We just be

No before

No beyond

A rowboat anchored in the middle of a pond

Do you see now child do you understand?

it’s a wheel

It’s a wheel Winnie

A ripple in water

Girl to wife to mother to daughter

Like all you kinfolk

Come and gone



It’s a wheel

It’s a wheel Winnie

A circle in motion

Can’t stop rowing, growing, changing and moving on

Can’t stop rowing, growing, and changing then moving on



a circle in motion

Can’t stop growing, rowing, changing

and moving on

Can’t stop growing, rowing, and

changing then moving on
