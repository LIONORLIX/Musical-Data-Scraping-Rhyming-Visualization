Story of the Tucks


May:

Once upon a time

Once upon a time

Can I start like that?



Miles:

Shouldn't start like that



May:

Be patient with me Winnie

I've never told this before

Once there was a man

A man with a wife

And a family



Jesse:

That's Miles and me



May:

Jesse, let me tell the story

I don't wanna start a war

We tore from the west to settle in the east

Looking for a farm or some land at least



Jesse:

Get to the part where I fall from the tree



Miles:

No, you've got it all wrong



May:

Miles, Jesse

Then we found a wood



Jesse:

Yes, we found a wood

Can you guess which wood



Winnie:

Mine?



Jesse:

You're good



May:

Where we found ourselves a clearing

And camped for the night

Just the four of us



Miles:

Plus the cat and the horse

They play a crucial part



May:

Yes, Miles of course

We slept by a spring near an old ash tree



Jesse:

And thats where I carved a T



May:

Jesse!



Miles:

In the morning

In the morning



Miles, Jesse, May:

We had no way of knowing

Without even thinking we drank from the spring

Who knew that spring would change everything



May:

Except for the horse

Everybody drank

Even the cat



Miles:

Remember that?



Jesse:

You can lead a horse to water



Miles:

I think she knows the phrase



May:

So days went by

Then months

Then years

With an ordinary life



Miles:

So it appears



May:

The old horse died at 25



Jesse:

But the cat was still alive



Miles:

We weren't changing



Jesse:

We weren't changing



May:

We weren't changing



Miles:

We weren't growing



Jesse:

We weren't growing



All three:

We had no way of knowing

Nobody was thinking

It's because of the spring

Who knew that spring would change everything



May:

The town began to talk

People shyed away

They were so outraged we hadn't aged

Our lives in pious

Our looks perverse

He survived much worse



Jesse:

Winnie look at me

Winnie listen here though



I survived a tree fall



Miles:

Shut up Jesse



May:                                                          Jesse:

Still we didn't know                                     Yes of course we knew

Didn't know the spring                                 How could we not know though

Was the cause of it

Or where we'd sit on the delacite balance       Jesse:

Between a blessing and a curse                     The greatest family

In the universe



Miles:

Don't confuse the girl



All three:

The cat and the horse

The T on the tree

The drink that changed us eternally

That's our secret keep it locked up tight



Winnie:

But I still don't understand



Miles:

Enough

Alright

We're not aging

We're not growing

And none of us know why

Once upon a time we drank from your spring

And now we'll never die



Jesse:

And that's the story of the Tucks

The end
