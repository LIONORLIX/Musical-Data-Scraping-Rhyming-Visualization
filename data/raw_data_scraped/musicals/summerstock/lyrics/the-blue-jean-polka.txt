Verse:



Come on and do the square dance

Like people ev'rywhere dance

So, hurry up and have your supper

Or you'll miss the warmer-upper

Chorus 1:



Old blue jeans and gingham pinafores a-crowdin' through the door,

The caller just said, "Won't you honor me?" so what are we waitin' for?

Swing your partner with ease,

Steal a hug if you please;

That's providin' that she's your own.

If you're oy and sly

With one nearby,

Bye and bye, you'll be goin' home alone.

And don't you dare to

Look into her eyes, for if you do, you're gonna miss the call;

So, keep your mind on what you're doin' till you're promenadin' all.

It's a barrel of fun

When a five-foot one

Swings a partner six foot tall;

So sip your cider, sip your coke,

Tomorrow night your feet will soak,

But tonight, ya gotta do the Blue Jean Polka.

So sip your cider, sip your coke,

Tomorrow night your feet will soak,

But tonight, ya gotta do the Blue Jean Polka,

Okey doeka!
