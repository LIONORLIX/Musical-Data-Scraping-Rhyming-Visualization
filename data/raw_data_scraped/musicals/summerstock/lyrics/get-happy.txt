Get Happy


Judy Garland Lyrics Get Happy



Forget your troubles

Come on get happy

You better chase all you cares away

Shout halleuja

Come on get happy

Get ready for the judgement day



The sun is shining

Come on get happy

The lord is waiting to take your hand

Shout halleuja

Come on get happy

We're going to the promised land



We're heading across the river

Wash your sins away in the tide

It's all so peaceful on the other side



Forget your troubles

Come on get happy

You better chase all you cares away

Shout halleuja

Come on get happy

Get ready for the judgement day



Forget your troubles

Come on get happy

You better chase all you cares away

Halleuja

Come on get happy

For the judgement day



The sun is shining

Come on get happy

The lord is waiting to take your hand

Shout halleuja

Come on get happy

We're going to the promised land



We're heading across the river

Wash your sins away in the tide

It's quiet and peaceful on the other side



Forget your troubles

Get happy

Your cares fly away

Shout halleuja

Get happy

Get ready your judgement day



Come on get happy

Chase your cares away

Shout halleuja

Come on get happy

Get ready for the judgement day



The sun is shining

Come on get happy

The lord is waiting to take your hand

Halleuja

Come on get happy

We're going to the promised land



We're heading across the river

Wash your sins away in the tide

It's all so peaceful on the other side



Shout halleuja

Come on get happy

You better chase all your cares away

Shout halleuja

Come on get happy

Get ready



Get ready-acap
