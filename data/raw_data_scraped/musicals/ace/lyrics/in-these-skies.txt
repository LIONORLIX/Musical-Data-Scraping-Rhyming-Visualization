In These Skies


There's a bang, then a rumble

Then the engine starts and it stumbles

One more tug

Now she?s going

There?s a strong propeller wind blowing

And she spits

And she sputters

As I check the tail and the rudders

And she jumps

Like she?s proving

Like she just can?t wait to get moving now

Down the field

Gaining speed

Pull her up

There she goes

There she goes

Oh



All my life

There?s been one desire

Just to fly like the birds I see

With these wings I am climbing higher

In these skies I am free



There?s a shick, then a rattle

I can tell she?s ready for battle

With a roar

It?s like thunder

How she even flies is a wonder

Made of wood and of wire

With a chance of catching on fire

All the risks are worth taking

As she leaves the crowd and I?m breaking free

Oh



Look above

Not a road to guide me

Thorough these clouds

I am free to roam

With this thrill

And this joy inside me

In these skies I am home



Now I see these folks below me

And I wonder if they know

Just like being there

They?re showing me

Just how far a simple man like me can go



All my life

There?s been one desire

Just to fly like the birds I see

With these wings I am climbing higher

In these skies I am free

Oh



In these skies

I have found my calling

More complete than a man should be

Let me rise without fear of falling

In these skies

In these skies

In these skies

I am free

I am free

I am free
