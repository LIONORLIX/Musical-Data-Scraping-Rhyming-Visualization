That Great Come-And-Get-It Day


On that great come and get it day,

Won't it be fun when worry is done and money is hay.

That's the time things'll com your way

On that great, great come and get it day.

I'll get my gal that calico gown.

I'll get my mule that acre of groun'

'Cause word has come from Gabriel's horn

The earth beneath your plow is a-buddin'

And now it's yourn.

Glory time's comin' for to stay

On that great, great come and get it day.



- On that great, great come-and-get-it day

- Come and get it, come and get it

Come and get it

Come and get it

Says here

Says it in the Good Book, it says

A mighty mornin’ is nigh

- Universal Fourth of July

- Hallelujah

Gonna get your freedom

And pie

What a day for banjos ringin’

What a day for people in overalls

Can’t you hear all the angels singin’

Come and get your gravy

And your two meatballs

Says here

Bells will ring in every steeple

Come and get your test

On the movie screen

Come you free and

You equal people

Come and get your beer

And your Benzedrines

Says here

Come and get it

Come and get it

- Come

- There's gonna be a world shakin’

- Bread breakin’ day

- Breakin’

Can I have a waffle iron?

It's comin’ to ya

Breakin’

Does that mean I get

a new washing machine?

With your initials

Breakin’

Hey, Woody, can we have a jukebox?

Says here.

Hey, Woody, how about a helicopter?

A helicopter?

Hallelujah!

- On that great come-and-get-it day

- Come-and-get-it day

Won’t it be fun when worry is done

And money is hay

That's the time

Thing's will come your way

- On that great, great come-and-get-it day

- Come-and-get-it day

My gown will be

A calico gown

My feet will dance

All over the town

'Cause word has come

From Gabriel's horn

The earth beneath your plough is a buddin’

And now it's yourn

Glory times

Comin’ for to stay

- On that great, great come-and-get-it

- Come and get it

- Yeah!

- Keep it!

- Come and get it

- Yeah! Share it!

Come-and-get-it day
