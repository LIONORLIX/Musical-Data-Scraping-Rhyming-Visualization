This Time Of The Year


Hear ye, hear ye.

We can't be bothered

with the mortgage man...



This time of the year!



You'll be sorry interfering

with the law.

For spring don’t care

About the mortgage man



This time of the year



I'm giving you your last chance

to get back your land.

The dandelions in the dusky dell

Don’t give a hoot in hell



- They're gonna smell without collateral

- This time of the year

- This time

- This time of the year

- Sweet merry buds and elderberry buds

- Don’t give a good ding-ding-dang



Corn’s shooting up

Fruit trees a-fruitin’ up

Go tell Rawkins to go hang-hang

Don’t mess around here



This time of the year



You'll get it in the rear



This time of the year



Magnolia’s are sentimental

Persimmons are queer

Keep your distance, now.

Give way, there.

You hear me? I said, keep your distance.

Don’t easily skeer

They sprout without real-estaters



This time of the year



That choo-choo’s comin'

And it's mighty clear

Woo, woo, Woody's here

He's up there ridin’ with the engineer



Yes, Woody's here





Just look at that choo-choo puffin’

Let's give it a mighty cheer

Just look at that engine huffin'

Dang blast it all, Woody's here



Woody's here!



Get a load of that whistle blowin'

That whistle is good to hear

It's wantin’ you to be knowin'

Dang blast it all, Woody's here





Woody's here!



Woody's here!
