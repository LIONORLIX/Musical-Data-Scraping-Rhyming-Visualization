We Gotta Make It Through the Winter (Reprise)


MILLY

You've got to make it through the winter

And hope for some lovin' in the spring.

You've got to make it through the winter

The time'll come when church bells will start to ring.

Just be patient 'til the spring.



GIRLS

'Til the spring, 'til the spring, 'til spring.
