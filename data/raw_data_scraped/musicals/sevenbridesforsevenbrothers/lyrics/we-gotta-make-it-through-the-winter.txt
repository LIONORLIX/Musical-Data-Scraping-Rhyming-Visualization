We Gotta Make It Through the Winter


DANIEL

Lemme out, lemme out

Lemme just see her.

Lemme out, lemme out

Out of this cage.



GIDEON

Stuck in a barn with cupid's cramp,



EPHRAIM

How can we live like this?



DANIEL

Why don't we go and sample just one kiss.



CALEB

Lemme out, lemme out

Lemme get near her,

Gotta shout, gotta shout

Gotta get free.



EPHRAIM

Didn't make plans to sleep with you

Cuddle up by your ear

Wanted to smell perfume and not smell beer.



ALL

But we gotta make it through the winter

Or we won't get lovin' in the spring.

We gotta make it make it through the winter

Or Millie says we won't get a doggone

Millie says we won't get a doggone

Millie says we won't get a doggone thing.



BENJAMIN

I see Dorcas lyin' there in a siky gown



ALL

(spoken)

Gosh!



EPHRAIM

Bet my Martha's in the tub soapin' herself down



ALL

(spoken)

Wow!



GIDEON

Did ya see how Alice danced never seen such curves



ALL (except Gideon)

Yeah!

Stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it,

You're gettin' on our nerves.



CALEB

Lemme out, lemme out,

Lemme caress her



ALL

He'll caress her.



CALEB

Lemme go through the door fella's it's war.



DANIEL

Gonna bust in and stake my claim



GIDEON

What am I man or mouse.



ALL

We should be with our women in that house.



BENJAMIN

Lemme by, lemme by

Lemme get to her



ALL

He'll get to her.



DANIEL

Feelin' bad



FRANK

Goin' mad



ALL

Goin' hog wild



DAN

Thought I'd be squeezin' someone soft

Somebody soft and frail

Who woulda dreamed that she'd be big and male?



ALL

Oh!

We gotta make it through the winter

Or we won't get lovin' in the spring.

We gotta make it through the winter

Or Milly says we won't get a doggone thing.



FRANK

Nothin' would be half as nice as strokin' Sarah's hair



ALL

Yeah!



DAN

Touchin' Liza while her clothes are hangin' on a chair.



ALL

Yeah!



CALEB

Ruth'll sigh and beg for more when we begin to pet.



ALL (except Caleb)

Yeah!

Stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it

You got us in a sweat.

Yes!

We gotta make it through the winter

Or we won't get lovin' in the spring.

We gotta make it through the winter

Or Milly says we won't get any

Milly says we won't get any

Milly says not a doggone thing.



BENJAMIN, EPHRAIM, GIDEON

We gotta make it through the winter.
