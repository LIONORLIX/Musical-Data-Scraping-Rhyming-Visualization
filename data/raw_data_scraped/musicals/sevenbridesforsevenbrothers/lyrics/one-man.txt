One Man


MILLY

It's enough to make you bitter

But I've never been a quitter

And I'm not nearly done.

Didn't marry seven brothers,

Didn't marry seven brothers.

Only married one.

I want one man to be mine alone

Crowds of strangers are all I've known.

One man to be frank and free with

One vow to be tied to

Someone willing to love me honestly.

Don't want to be lied to,

I want one man who can show he cares

For more than cookin' and dusted chairs.

One man who respects my thinking,

Two promises planted firmly rooted

We'll share our feelings and not take them for granted.

I walked into love and I took a blow,

But I'll never break.

I'm holding my ground 'cause deep down I know

It's not a mistake, it's not a mistake, it's not a mistake!

I want one man and I'll face the fight

Won't give in 'til it works out right.

Things worth havin' don't come easy,

I'll finish what I began.

I know this is it, I'm not gonna quit

I've found that one man.

Things worth havin' don't come easy,

I'll finish what I began.

I know this is it, I'm not gonna quit

I've found that one man.

I know this is it, they won't make quit

I've found that one man.
