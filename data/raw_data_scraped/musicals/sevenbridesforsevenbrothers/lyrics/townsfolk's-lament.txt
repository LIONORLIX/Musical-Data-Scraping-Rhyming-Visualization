Townsfolk's Lament


PREACHER, BIXBY, PERKINS

Protect the virtue of our lambs

Don't lead them to the slaughter.



TOWNSMEN

Slaughter the snakes.

Tear 'em to apart.

Batter their bones.

Bash in their heads.

While they're at home

Asleep in their beds.



PREACHER, BIXBY, PERKINS

Lord, sweet lord!

Keep our maidens pure as snow,

As pure as holy water.



TOWNSMEN

Shootin' em down.

They're gonna fall.

Beatin' 'em up.

They're gonna crawl.

Burn 'em alive.

Murder them all.

Bustin' their butts, Bustin' their, Bustin their,

Amen!
