Woman Ought to Know Her Place (Reprise)


ADAM

Stayin' here I'm keepin' out

I won't have any woman takin' over.



GIDEON

Milly needs you please come home.



ADAM

She's gonna have to learn

I ain't no Molly Coodle

She can shove around.



GIDEON

She only wanted to reason with you.



ADAM

No more tellin' me what I can do or think



GIDEON

Try to see it her way.



ADAM

When to smoke and when to cuss and what to drink.



ADAM GIDEON

Ever since our weddin' Don't be stubborn and unbending

She' tried to hold the reins.

No woman's puttin' me in chains. She's depending on you.

A woman ought to know her place Lovers should be sharin'

And give her husband all she can. Stand together carin'

A woman ought to know her place

Is behind her man. Not behind him



GIDEON

But beside him.



ADAM

Am I stubborn and unbending?

Is she really depending on me?

Can it be?

Is my brother right?
