Glad That You Were Born


MILLY

Through your eyes skies look brighter

Grass more green clouds are whiter.

When you're close cares grow lighter,

I'm glad that you were born.

Through your eyes hills stretch higher.

When you smile you inspire hearts to sing in a choir.

I'm glad that you were born.

Born to laugh, born to dream

Born to spread your light.

Through your eyes I see clearer

You bring God so much nearer.

Life has grown so much dearer,

I'm glad that you were...



ALL

Born to laugh, born to dream.

Born to spread your light.



MILLY

Through your eyes I see clearer

You bring God so much nearer.

Life has grown so much dearer

I'm glad that you were born.
