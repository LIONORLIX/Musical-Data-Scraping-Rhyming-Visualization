Wonderful, Wonderful Day


MILLY

Could have married long ago

I said "no" when fellers came proposing.

Bankers, teachers, preachers, too

Were among the men I could have chosen.

Kept my feet on the ground,

Now I know where I'm bound.

He came out of nowhere,

Walkin' through the door,

Lookin' straight my way.

Wonderful, wonderful day.

He saw someone touch me

And he tossed him out like a bale of hay.

Wonderful, wonderful day.

Can't wait til I'm with him

In our cabin just for two.

Sheltered and secluded

Only trees near us

No one hearin' us.

And so you'll forgive me.

If I simply throw my chest and say:

"Wonderful, wonderful day."



LIZA, MARTHA, RUTH

Think of the suitable men in this town

When you're in those mountains there's no comin' down.



MILLY

He said there's a big spread

It's a hilltop haven where we will stay.



LIZA, MARTHA, RUTH

You can't mean it,

You ain't even seen it.



MILLY

Wonderful, wonderful



LIZA, MARTHA, RUTH

You hardly know him,

He could mistreat you.

Think of the wolves and the bears that could eat you.



MILLY

How bad can the wolves be after

Wolves that pinch me and grab my tray.



LIZA, MARTHA, RUTH

Stop the pastor, oh, disaster.



MILLY

Wonderful, wonderful day.



LIZA, MARTHA, RUTH

Least ways let him court you

Make him come back in the spring.

Can this man support you?

Milly think is he a drifter,

A drinking man?



MILLY

Full steam heading upstream

If I sink or swim I believe in him

Wonderful, wonderful



LIZA, MARTHA, RUTH

Please don't be hurried



MILLY

Wonderful, wonderful



LIZA, MARTHA, RUTH

Milly we're worried



MILLY

Wonderful, wonderful



LIZA, MARTHA, RUTH

Milly resist him.



MILLY

It's too late,

It's too late,

It's too late,

I've already kissed him!

Beautiful, glorious, heavenly, marvelous,

Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful, wonderful,

Wonderful, wonderful day!
