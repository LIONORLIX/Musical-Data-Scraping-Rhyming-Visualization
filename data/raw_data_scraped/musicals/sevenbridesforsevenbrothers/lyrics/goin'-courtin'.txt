Goin' Courtin'


MILLY

Goin' courtin', goin' courtin'

Oh it sets your senses in a whirl.

Goin' courtin', goin' courtin'

Dudin' up to go and see your gal.

Oh, it's fun to hunt and shoot a gun,

Or to catch a rabbit on the run

But you'll find it's twice as sportin' goin' courtin'.

Now there's lots o' things you gotta know

Be sure the parlor light is low

Y' sidle up and squeeze her hand

Let me tell you fella's that is grand.

You hem and haw a little while

She gives you kinda half a smile.

You cuddle up she moves away

Then the strategy comes into play.

Goin' courtin', goin' courtin'

If you find it hard to break the ice

Goin' courtin', goin' courtin'

Here's a little feminine advice.

Roll your eyes and heave a little sigh.

Grunt and groan like you're about to die.

That is what's known as emotin' goin' courtin'!



BENJAMIN

(spoken)

How 'bout parkin parlor's darkin'

And you're longing for a fond embrace



DANIEL

(spoken)

How 'bout pettin'

How 'bout sofa settin'



GIDEON

(spoken)

Suppose she up and slaps your face



MILLY

(spoken)

Just remember "blessed are the meek"



(sung)

Don't forget to turn the other cheek,

Soon you'll both be larkin',

Goin' sparkin'?

Goin' dancin'?



BOYS

Goin' dancin'?



MILLY

At a fancy ball or minuet.

Goin' dancin',

You'll impress her with your etiquette.



FRANK

(spoken)

You mean that men are learnin' how to dance?



MILLY

Yes, it came direct from Paris, France

It'll help with your romancin' goin' dancin'.



BROTHERS

Goin' courtin', goin' courtin'

Oh, it sees your senses in a whirl

Goin' courtin', goin' courtin'

Duddin' up to go and see your girl.

Oh it's fun to shoot a gun

Or to catch a rabbit on the run,

But you'll find it's twice as sportin'

Goin' courtin'.



MILLY

(spoken)

Keep your fishin'



BROTHERS

(spoken)

And fussin'



MILLY

(spoken)

And fightin'



BROTHERS

(spoken)

And cussin'



ALL

(spoken)

And trappin'



(sung)

'Cause we're goin' courtin'!
