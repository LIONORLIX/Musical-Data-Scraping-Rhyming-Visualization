Spring, Spring, Spring (Spring Dance)


CALEB:

Oh, the barnyard is busy in a regular tizzy,

And the obvious reason is because of the season

Ma Nature's lyrical, with her yearly miracle

Spring, Spring, Spring.



BENJAMIN:

All the hen-folk are hatchin'

While their men-folk are scrathin'

To ensure the survival of each brand new arrival.

DORCAS:

Each nest is twitterin',

They're all baby-sitterin',

Spring, Spring, Spring.



FRANK:

It's a beehive of buddin' son and daughter life,

Every family has plans in view.

Even down in the brook the underwater life

Is forever blowin' bubbles too.



LIZA:

Every field wears a bonnet

With some spring daisies on it,

Even birds of a feather show their clothes off together.

EPHRAIM:

Sun's gettin' shinery, to spotlight the finery,

LIZA:

Spring, Spring, Spring.



GIDEON:

From his eyrie, the eagle with his eagle eye

Gazes down across his eagle beak

And a'fixin' his lady with the legal eye

Screams "suppose we fix the date this week!"



CALEB & RUTH with DANIEL & MARTHA:

Yes, siree, spring disposes

That it's all one supposes

It's a real bed of roses

Waggin' tails, rubbin' noses.



All BROTHERS (except Ephraim) & All BRIDES:

Each day is Mother's Day

The next is some other's day

When all is King ....



EPHRAIM: (arrivin' at the rondevue area, and yellin'):

FRANK, DAN, BEN, CALEB, EVERYBODY

Milly's havin' her baby!



Squeals of excitement from the

other brothers and the brides
