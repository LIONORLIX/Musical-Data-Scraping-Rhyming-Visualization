I'm Coming Out Of My Shell


Snail:

I was always timid

I guess it was because

I may have been ashamed of who I am

Or what I was

I thought, ‘I’m just a snail.

A lot of shell. A little goo.

But all of that has changed,

As now the following is true

I got something I do

Something I’m proud of

Because I do it pretty well

Bing-bang-boom

Give me some room

I’m coming out of my shell

Get out the word

Find me a witness

Blow on a trumpet

Ring a bell

Holy smokes!

Look at me, folks!

I’m comin’ out of my shell

There were slugs who doubted me

I guess that made be nervous

I never even dared to dream of life in civil service

They said I wasn’t fast enough,

They said, ‘Hey, you’re too gooey!’

But then I turned around and told them ‘Phooey!

That’s all hooey!’

I was nothing but goo under the surface

Than everything began to gel

Holy cow!

Look at me now!

I’m comin’ out of my’

Yes, I deliver

I’m comin’ out of my’

I’m goin’ postal!

I’m comin’ out of my shell!
