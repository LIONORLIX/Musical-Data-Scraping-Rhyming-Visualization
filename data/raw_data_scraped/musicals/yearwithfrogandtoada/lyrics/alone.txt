Alone


Frog:

Sometimes the days, they can be very busy

So I like to stop and think now and then

I think of the reasons I have to be happy

And that makes me happy all over again

What made you think that I was unhappy’

What were you thinking was making me blue’

I only come out here to sit and remember

I love being a frog in the warm sunny summer

On days such as this one, that’s what I do

This morning I woke up and thought, ‘I am happy!’

It’s been since April since I have been sad

I’ll go be alone to think how I’m happy

For all that I have, and all that I’ve had

What made you think that I was unhappy’

What were you thinking was making me blue’

I only came out here to think how I’m happy

I love being a frog in the warm sunny summer

But mostly I’m happy because I have you
