The Letter (Reprise)


Snail:

I’m carrying a letter, a most important letter

A letter that was written by Frog

I’m traveling so fast, I’m assuming you’re aghast,

Or at the very least, you are agog

I’m the snail with the mail, I’ll deliver without fail

Pardon the cloud of dust

I’m speeding with an envelope as fast as any antelope

Forward and onward I thrust
