A Year With Frog And Toad (Reprise)


Boy bird:

The summer has ended

The summer has ended



Lady birds:

Notice, if you will, the swirling leaves



All:

And as they are swirling

Squirrels, they are squirreling

Nuts and other goodies up their sleeves



Boy bird:

Soon it will be cold

And we will bid you all adieu



All:

Cause when you are a bird,

It’s either fly or get the flu. So

We go south for the winter

South for the winter

And we’ll come back in the spring
