He'll Never Know


Frog (spoken):

Look at all these leaves!



Toad (spoken):

Look at all these leaves!



Frog (spoken):

I know, i will go and rake toad’s yard, and he will have a wonderful surprise!



Toad (spoken):

I know, i will go and rake frog’s yard, and he will have a wonderful surprise!

(sung)

He’ll never know!



Frog:

He will not ever suspect



Toad:

Who raked the yard



Frog:

Nor will he ever detect



Both:

He will come home



Toad:

He’ll scratch his head



Frog:

He’ll furrow his brow



Toad:

He’ll stroke his chin



Both:

And wonder how, how’ow, my aching back!



Toad:

The work is slow



Frog:

Oh, what a tedious chore



Toad:

And kinda dull

Frog:

Raking is rather a bore



Both:

But despite a little ache,

I’m gonna rake, rake, rake, rake

Ache, ache, ache



(they proceed to rake, doing it to the beat of the music in a choreographed fashion)



Both:

He’ll wonder what

What in the world has occurred

And when he asks

I will not utter a word

He’ll wonder how

How could this possibly be?

He’ll wonder who

He might even think it was me!

But if he asks?



Frog (spoken):

Frog’



Toad (spoken):

Toad’



Both:

Was it you?

Not me! Well then, who?

Who raked up the mess?



Toad:

I haven’t a guess



Frog:

I haven’t even a clue



Both:

Hee, hee, hee, hee

Ha, ha, ho, ho

Who?

I wish i could see him see it!

He’ll do a double take!



Frog:

It’s inconceivable!



Toad:

It’s unbelievable!



Both:

I left the leaves,

The leaves have left,

And i never lifted a rake!!



Frog (spoken):

Well, this job is done. It’s time to walk home.



Toad (spoken):

Well, this job is done. It’s time to walk home!



Frog (spoken):

Hello, squirrel!



Squirrel 1 (spoken):

Hello frog.



Toad (spoken):

Hello, squirrel!



Squirrel 2 (spoken):

Hello, toad.



Squirrel 1 (spoken):

Look at this pile of leaves in toad’s yard!



Squirrel 2 (spoken):

Look at this pile of leaves in frog’s yard!



Both (spoken):

Let’s mess ‘em up!



Frog:

He’ll never know!

Think of how happy he’ll be

He’ll never know!

Almost as happy as me



Toad (singing under frog):

Think of how happy,

how happy he’ll be!

Almost as happy,

As happy as me!



Both:

He’ll never ever, ever know!

He’ll never ever, ever know!

He’ll never ever, ever know?

(they spot their own messy yards that have been messed up by the squirrels)

(spoken)

I’ll rake my leaves tomorrow.
