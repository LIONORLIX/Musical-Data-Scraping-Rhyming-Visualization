Spring


Frog:

Toad!



Toad (spoken):

Blah!



Frog:

Toad!



Toad (spoken):

BLAH!!!



Frog:

Hibernation?s over!



Toad (spoken):

No it isn?t!!



Frog:

Oh, but it is so, Toad.

Flowers grow, Toad.

Sprouting through the clover!



Toad (spoken):

Blah!! Clover?..



Frog (spoken):

Toad?..



Toad (spoken):

BLAH!!!



Frog (spoken):

Toad, your alarm clock is ringing!!! It?s Spring!



Toad (spoken):

It?s Spring!?



Frog (spoken):

Yes!



Toad:

Ding Ding-a-ling

Is it spring, is it spring?

Is it true?



Frog (spoken):

Yes!



Toad:

Frog, would you please be so kind as to hand me my shoe?



Frog (spoken):

Why certainly, Toad.



Toad (spoken):

Thank you, Frog!!

(he hits the still ringing alarm clock with his shoe in order to quiet it)

Goodnight! Clover???.



Frog (spoken):

But Toad, it is APRIL!



Toad (spoken):

Oh! Is it April?



Frog (spoken):

YES!!



Toad (spoken):

Good! Wake me up in MAY!



Frog (spoken):

But Toad, I will be lonely without you!



Toad (spoken):

BLAH!



Frog:

I love the spring, it?s an excellent season

Wonderful things to see and to do

And yet I am sad for an excellent reason

Spring isn?t?.springy

No, not without you.

(spoken)

(looking at Toad?s calendar)

Well?January?s over.

(he rips off the January page)

February?s over.

(he rips off the February page)

March is over.

(he rips off the March page)

April?s almost over??.

(he rips off the April page)

Toad, it?s May!!



Toad (spoken):

It?s May!



Frog (spoken):

Well, according to your calendar!



Toad (spoken):

Oh my! There?s so much to do! I?ve got to clean the house! I?ve got to mulch the yard! And I?ve GOT to get some breakfast! I

haven?t eaten since January!

(sung)

Frog!



Frog (spoken):

Yes, Toad?



Toad:

Frog!



Frog (spoken):

What is it?



Toad (spoken):

You know I was thinking, that extra month of sleep really makes a difference!

(sung)

Smell the flowers, see the plants



Both:

Hear the marching of the ants!

Feel the sun shine, feel the breeze!



Toad:

Look out, Frog, here comes some bees!



Both:

Listen to the birdies sing!



Birds:

Tweet, tweet, tweet, let?s greet the spring!

Let?s greet the spring!



All:

It?s spring! Spring!
