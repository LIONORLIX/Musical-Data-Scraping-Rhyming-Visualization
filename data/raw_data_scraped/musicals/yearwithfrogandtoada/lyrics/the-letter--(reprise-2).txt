The Letter  (Reprise 2)


Snail:

I’m carrying a letter

A most important letter

A letter than was written by Frog

But in this snowy frosting,

Running is exhausting

So maybe I’ll slow to a jog

I’m the snail with the mail

I’ll deliver without fail

In the ice and snow and slush

But since it’s getting dusky,

I’m pretending I’m a husky

Mush, mush, mush, mush, mush, mush, mush

Arf!
