A Year With Frog And Toad


We flew south for the winter

South for the winter

Every fall we pack our things and go

We know just how to time it to find the proper climate

One that doesn,t feature any snow

Cause when it snows you shiver

And it,s difficult to fly

There isn,t any food, which is another reason why

We go south for the winter

South for the winter

But we,re back! It,s almost spring!

In spring the weather,s lovely!

It elevates the mood

But even more important:

There,s a plentitude of food!

So if you,re feeling peckish

You could go for seconds

Even thirds!



Boy bird: winter,s for the birds!



Lady bird 2 (spoken): no it isn,t!



Boy bird: it,s an expression!



Lady bird 2 (spoken): oh,.



Birds:

Winter now is over!

The snow has all been snowed!

Spring is near, which starts a year

With frog and toad!



Boy bird (spoken):

Well, it,s true folks! Spring is almost here! The sun will be shining,

The flowers will be growing, the birds will be chirping!



Lady birds: chirp chirpety chirp!



Boy bird (spoken): here we have frog. And over here we have toad.

They are both at the end of a winter long hibernation.

Let,s take a peek in and see what they,re dreaming about.



Frog:

I,d like to sing a little ode

About my good friend toad

Toad with whom i frequently take tea

He,s not so good at sports

And of course, he,s got those warts, but

Toad has been a lovely friend to me

Toad i feel is vastly under rated

And furthermore i think misunderstood

And in conclusion, i will add

He is the finest friend of all the critters

In the neighborhood



Toad:

I love a lively dialogue

With my good friend frog

Chatting over cozy cups of tea

He knows just the thing to say

That will brighten up my day, oh

Frog has been a lovely friend to me

Frog is very kindly in his nature

Magnanimous whenever playing host

Of all the creatures in my sphere of influence

I,m found to stop at frog the most

There is a frog



Frog:

There is a toad



Both:

And he lives just down the road



Toad:

There could be no better friend for me



Frog:

Or me



Both:

It seems



Toad:

Frog is the frog



Frog:

Toad is the toad



Both:

Of my dreams



Frog (spoken):

Hello toad!



Toad (spoken):

Hello, frog!



Frog (spoken):

What are you doing in my dream,



Toad (spoken):

Funny, i was about to ask you the same thing.



Frog (spoken):

Oh, well it certainly is nice to see you!



Toad (spoken):

I feel the same way. How has your winter been,



Frog (spoken):

Well, i,m hibernating, so there isn,t much to report.



Toad (spoken):

It,s about the same for me. This is a very nice dream though!



Frog (spoken):

Yes, it is. Well, i,m getting ready to wake up, so you,d better get back to your own dream,

I,ll see you when you wake up!



Toad (spoken):

Yes, i,d better get back to hibernating! Spring is almost here!



Frog (spoken):

Oh, i think it,s just around the corner. Birds,



Birds:

The sun is out

The sky is clear

We came back

Spring,s almost be here

So let,s begin another year



All:

A year with frog and toad!

A year with frog and toad!
