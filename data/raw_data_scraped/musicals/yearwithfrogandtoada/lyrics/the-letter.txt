The Letter


Frog (spoken):

Snail?



Snail (spoken):

Yes, Frog?



Frog (spoken):

Would you deliver this letter to Toad for me?



Snail (spoken):

Me? You want me to deliver your letter?



Frog (spoken):

Yes.



Snail (spoken):

Why, absolutely! And I am flattered that you are putting your trust in me!

I will deliver your letter, Frog! You can count on me!

(sung)

I’m carrying a letter

A most important letter

A letter Frog has written to Toad

I’d love to stay and chat

Stick around and chew the fat

But duty calls, and I must hit the road

I’m the snail with the mail, I’ll deliver without fail

Whether rain or sleet or snow

No snail has feet more fleet-ah (fleeter)

Why, I’m practically a cheetah!

I put the ‘go’ in ‘escargot’!
