Good News, Bad News (Reprise)


Elliot



The good news is

The war between the roses

Struck and unexpected truce

And the good news is

She's given me a cause to make my head out of the noose



We're heading toward an interesting chapter

Certain to fascinate

The bad news is she won't be home till eight
