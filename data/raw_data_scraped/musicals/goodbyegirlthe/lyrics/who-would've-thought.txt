Who Would've Thought


Paula



Who would've thought

This subhuman sublet

With an ego the size

Of the national debt

Would live up to his hype

But he isn't my type



Elliot



Who would've thought

I'd subdue and disarm

Her disdain and contempt

With the force of my charm

She'd resist if she could

I must really be good



Paula & Elliot



Why couldn't I see it coming?

Why didn't I have a clue?

I suddenly fell like humming



Paula



And I must put a stop to this soon



Elliot



I can feel that she's changing her tune



Paula



Who would believe

I'm enough of a fool

To be taking the plunge

After draining the pool

We may learn to be friends

But that's right where it ends



Paula & Elliot



All that I know

Is that just down the hall

In the very next room

Through this paper-thin wall

There's a creature I hated

I can't wait to wake up and see

Who would have thought that



Paula



This nightmare



Elliot



This wonderful blunder



Paula & Elliot



Would happen to me

Who would have thought?



Lucy & Cynthia



Who would have thought it

Would take them so long



Cynthia



I was sure of last week



Lucy



And last weekend was wrong



Melanie



This is totally cool



Lucy & Cynthia



That's cause you won the pool



Melanie



When do you think

They will cut to the chase



Lucy



Well, his odds have improved



Cynthia



Since he got to first base



Three girls



And he's coming on strong

So it shouldn't be long

This couldn't be more outstanding

We hang on their every move



Melanie



It's very much like "Knots Landing"



Cynthia & Melanie



Will he charm her right into his palm?



Lucy



If he doesn't she isn't my mom



Three girls



What happens next

Could be anyone's call



Cynthia & Melanie



We're depending on you

With your ear to the wall



Three girls



To turn into a spy to be of those sly little elves

Till we're grown, on your own, and are prone to find

Romance

Ourselves

Who would've thought?

Who would've thought?
