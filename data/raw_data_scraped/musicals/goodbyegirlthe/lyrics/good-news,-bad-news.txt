Good News, Bad News


Eliot



What a gyp-

This I such a rip-off

Every time she sneers at me

I want to rip her upper lip off

But this is not a healthy way to live

I've gotta be more. . .positive



The good news is

She doesn't own a shotgun so I guess I got off cheap

The bad news is tonight I'm counting squatters

When I should be counting sheep

The good news is I'm here in New York where solvency

May await

The bad news is the good news ain't so great



Sure I'm tired, depressed and pissed

I'll pretend to be an optimist



The good news is I'm sharing this apartment with a pair

Of single chicks

The bad news is that one of them is rabid and the

Other's three foot six



Paula



The good news is we're safe in my bed not out on

The street, knock wood

The bad news is he could be here for good



Paula & Eliott



The good news is some quick negotiation

Kept the roof above my head

The bad news is a homicidal maniac

Is ten feet from my bed



Lucy



The bad news is we're stuck with a roommate

This one is a ticking bomb

The good news is-

This time I'm the one who sleeps with mom!



All



The bad news is that I haven't slept a wink

And it's almost dawn

The good news is

Maybe I'll wake up and



Elliot



She'll be



Paula & Lucy



He'll be



All



Gone

Why this?

Why me?

Why now?
