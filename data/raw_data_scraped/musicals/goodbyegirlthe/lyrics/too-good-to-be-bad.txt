Too Good To Be Bad


All



Your sainted mother said to stay away from us

That she looked down on us is no surprise

Your father couldn't spend a day away from us

I still recall the hunger in his eyes



Donna



Your doctor and your dentist suggest that you

Ignore us



Paula



They abhor us



Genna



So they tell you slanderous lies



All



But don't listen to them

Listen to us



Genna



I'm sweets



Donna



I'm fats



Paula



I'm fries







All three



Say so long to self control



Paula



We've a need to feed your soul



Genna



How could we possibly hurt you



All three



We're in every snack and dessert you have had

Honest, sugar



Paula



We're too good to be bad

We're so lonesome on the shelf



Donna



Take us down,

Indulge yourself



All three



We'd like to show you our favors



Paula



And more than a few of the flavors you crave



Genna



Face it, pork rind-



All



You're too weal to behave



All three



Let your appetite run riot



Donna



You know you want us--don't deny it



All three



It's up to you to do or diet







Paula



And everything is better when you deep fat fry it

Life with us is short and sweet



All three



(We're) worth our weight in cellulite



Donna



Health food's for neurotics



Jenna



And macrobiotic's a fad



All three



The FDA requires us to state this warning

The odds are great that you will hate yourself

In the morning



Paula



But eat your heart out



All three



We're too good to be bad
