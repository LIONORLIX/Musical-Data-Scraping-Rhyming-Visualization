Don't Follow In My Footsteps


Paula



Sometimes even mothers make mistakes

And I've made my share

Though I swear I've tried to be the best I can be

But sometimes I forget that you are always there

Like a video camera

Always watching me



Think about your ever-loving mother as a

Luminous example

Just cause I've an appetite for heartache doesn't mean

You need a sample

I'm counting on you to exercise good solid judgement

Totally different from mine

Don't follow in my footsteps

And you're gonna be fine



Lucy



You want me to watch you ev'ry movement and the expect

Me to ignore you



Paula



You can go and make your own mistakes or you can let

Me make them for you

Whenever you see me go down in flames ask the question

Why put my hand in the fire?

Don't follow in my footsteps



Lucy & Paula



These are words to inspire



Paula



Do as I say not as I do

Just to spare the lion's share of what I've been through

Just remember everything that I did wrong

I did it all wrong for you



Lucy



How would you react if I decided to grow up to be a

Dancer?



Paula



I would prob'bly ground you till you're fifty while

I thought about the answer



Lucy



I wanna make my life on the stage just like you did



Paula



Find an original sin

Don't pick up any dance steps

Don't pick up any actors

Don't follow in my footsteps

That's a place to begin



Now and then you've caught me with a cigarette

While wheezing hard and choking



Lucy



Mom, I got the message

That's why I decided to quit smoking

Whenever I'm in a moment

Of doubt, I remember

Mom's an infallible guide

Don't follow in her footsteps



Paula



And you'll fill me with pride



Lucy



Moms have got it rough but if you really want a

Challenge

Be a daughter



Both



It's about as hard as walking on or

Breathing under water



Paula



Where do you find a kid who'll just do what

She's told to?



Lucy



Ripley's believe it or not



Paula



Don't



Both



Follow in my footsteps



Paula



You'll



Both



Miss a lot of potholes



Paula



You'll



Both



Make it though the minefield

It's your very best shot



Paula



So thank you loving momma

Who did it all wrong for you



Both



She's a prefect example

The key to exactly what not to do
