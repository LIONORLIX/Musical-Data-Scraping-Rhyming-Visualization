How Can I Win?


Paula



How can I learn to trust enough?

And to stop believing all I hear are lies

Open my heart but just enough

To keep an open mind but never close my eyes

To the dangers I alert myself

Making efforts to assert myself

And discovering ways to hurt myself

That no one else has tried

How can I win if I'm not on my side?



How can I dare to feel again?

If I can't let go of past mistakes I've made

Living through each ordeal again

The faith that I misplaced, the price I overpaid

I've been able to endure enough

But I must not want the cure enough

I get back on my feet and sure enough

My hopes and fears collide

How can I win if I'm not on my side?



I live each day like emotions are at war

But I don't remember anymore

Just who or what I'm fighting for



When will delight be mine again?

Will it come or can it be that it's too late?

I want the sun to shine again

But I must walk away from the shadows I create



And though I tell myself it's safer just to hide

How can I win if I keep retreating?

Cheating myself is self-defeating

How can I win if I'm not on my side?
