I Think I Can Play This Part


Elliot



Tell me how'd ya like to be my kid

Does that really sound so bad

Mark this down, I'm putting in my bid

Lucky you

Are one of the few

Who get to chose their dad



What you're looking for

Is the stand-up, steadfast type

Who's rugged strong yet sensitive and kind

But a leading man

With a sentimental stripe

Plus charisma

Is always hard to find

Does that sound like anyone we know?

Anyone we've met?

Who can we get?



I think I can play this part

Though no one's ever got it right before

I've a new interpretation

And a lot of motivation

And I seem to know the lines by heart

I'm sure I can play this part



You've been holding out

For a white knight on a steed

Who's dashing, handsome, filled with warmth and wit

Who can make you laugh

Sense of humor guaranteed

Plus an ego

And a smile that doesn't quit

Can this world-class paragon be found?

And who can he be?

Sounds just like me



I know I can play this part

It's one that I've prepared for all my life

I'll approach it with devotion

Understanding and emotion

Say the word cause I can't wait to start

I'm sure I can play this part



I'm a quick study

And I love to rehearse

And I fell a strong connection

Tell me what you need from me

I can't take direction



I'm burning to play this part

And no one's ever longed to play it more

It's a role that I'm so right for

That I'm willing to fight for

We can both create a work of art

And I promise to stay for the run of the play

I know I play this part
