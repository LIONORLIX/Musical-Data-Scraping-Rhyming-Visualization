What A Guy


Paula



What a guy

He can fight like a champ, yes-sir-ee

What a guy

Though he's crazy-he's crazy for me



When I said hold off the wedding

The color left his cheeks

Don't'cha love a guy who freaks

At waiting seven weeks

What a guy

He was probably as charming at birth

Who I know if I asked him would gladly move heaven and

Earth

Even I can hardly miss

What a guy like this is worth



He's the first one I trust to come back



What a guy

When he does I'll give him him such a smack

He's no chip off Chippendale

But he's breath of spring

He does rotten imitations

But he's the real thing



What a guy

He's a guy with a hell of a nerve

But he's kind and he's good he thinks this is what I

Deserve

And it's hard to disagree

When a guy like this loves me



How I overlooked

His great appeal

A month ago

Now like in the past

I'm the last to know



What a mensch

I can hardly believe what he did

He even proposed to my kid

Any idiot can see

What a guy

Who is decent and honest and true

Who could smile through what I put him through

What a guy for me
