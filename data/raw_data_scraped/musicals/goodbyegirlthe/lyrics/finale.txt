Finale


Elliot



I think I can play this part

I know at last that I belong with you



Paula

Cause it all comes down to timing



Elliot



And an awful lot of climbing



Both



Every word, I swear, is from the heart

And I promise to stay



Lucy



For the run of the play



All



I know I can play this part!
