Shaking at the High School Hop


[ENSEMBLE]

Well, honky-tonk baby get on the floor

All the cats are yellin' they're shoutin' for more

My baby likes to rock, my baby likes to roll

My baby does the chicken and she does the stroll



Well shake it

Yeah shake it

Yeah shake it

Everybody shakin'

Shakin' at the high school hop





Well sock-hop baby

Roll up your crazy jeans

Gonna rock to the music

Gonna dig the scene

Shimmy to the left

Cha-cha to the right

We're gonna do the r omp till broad daylight



Let's shake it (Shake, shake, shake)

Y?ah shake it (Shake, shake, shak?)

Yeah shake it

Everybody shakin'

Shakin' at the high school hop



[GIRLS]

We're gonna alley-oop on blueberry hill



[GUYS]

Hully gully with Lucille we won't be standin still



[ENSEMBLE]

Hand-jive baby, do the stomp with me

A calypso- do the sloppa, gonna bop with mister Lee



Shake it

Yeah shake it

Yeah shake it

Everybody shakin'

Shakin' at the high school



Shake, Rock and Roll

Rock, Roll and Shake

Shake, Rock and Roll

Everybody shakin'

Shakin' at the high school hop
