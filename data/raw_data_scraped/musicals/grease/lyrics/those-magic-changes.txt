What's that playing on the radio?

Why do I start swaying to and fro?

I have never heard that song before

But, if I don't hear it anymore

It's still familiar to me

Sends a thrill right through me

Cause those chords remind me

Of the night that I first fell in love to



Those magic changes my heart arranges (Ahh, ahh)

A melody that's never the same (Shoo-da-sha, shoo-da-sha)

A melody that's calling your name (Shoo-da-sha, shoo-da-sha)

It begs you please, come back to me (Please, la la la la)

Please, return to me (La la la la)

Don't go away again (Shoo-da-sha, shoo-da-sha)

Oh make th?m play again (Shoo-da-sha)

The music I wanna hear is once again (Shoo-da-sha)

You whisp?r in my ear (Shoo-da-sha)

Ohhh (Shoo-da-sha, shoo-da-sha)

Oh my darling

I'll be waiting by the radio (Ahh, la la la la la la)

You'll come back to me someday, I know (Ahh, la la la la la la)

Been so long since our last goodbye (Ahh, la la la la la la)

But I'm singin' as I cry-iy-iy

While the bass is sounding (Da da da da)

While the drums are pounding (Da da da da)

Beatings of my broken heart (Da da da da)

Will rise the first place on the charts



My heart arranges (Ahh)

Those magic changes (La la)
