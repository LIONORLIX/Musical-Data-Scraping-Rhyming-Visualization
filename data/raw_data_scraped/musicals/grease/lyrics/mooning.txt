Mooning


[ROGER]

I spend my days just mooning

So sad and blue, so sad and blue

I spend my nights just mooning

All over you



[JAN]

All over who?



[ROGER]

Oh I'm so full of love, as any fool can see (Ohh)

Cause angels up above, have hung the moon on me (Ooo)



[JAN]

Why must you go



[ROGER]

Why must I go



[BOTH]

On mooning



[ROGER]

So all alone



[JAN]

So all alone



[ROGER]

There would be no



[JAN]

There would be no



[BOTH]

More mooning



[ROGER]

If you would call me



[JAN]

Up on my phone



[ROGER (JAN)]

I guess I'll keep on striking poses (Ohh)

'till my cheeks have lost their roses



[BOTH]

Mooning over you



[ROGER]

I'll stand behind



[JAN]

You'll stand behind

[BOTH]

You mooning



[ROGER]

Forevermore



[JAN]

Forevermore



[ROGER]

Someday you'll find



[JAN]

Someday I'll find



[BOTH]

You mooning



[ROGER]

At your front door



[JAN]

At my front door



[ROGER (JAN)]

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Oh, everyday at school I want ya (Ohh)

Always will until I got ya (Ohh)



[BOTH]

Mooning too



[ROGER]

There's a moon out tonight
