Youâ€™re The One That I Want


[DANNY]

I got chills, they're multiplying

And I'm losing control

'Cause the power you're supplying

It's electrifying



[SANDY]

You better shape up, 'cause I need a man

And my heart is set on you

You better shape up, you better understand

To my heart, I must be true



[DANNY]

Nothing left



[SANDY & DANNY]

Nothing left for me to do



You're the one that I want



[ENSEMBLE]

You are the one I want



[SANDY & DANNY]

[ENSEMBLE]

[SANY]

If you're filled with affection

You're too shy to convey

Meditate my direction

Feel your way

[DANNY]

I better shape up

'Cause you need a man



[SANDY]

I need a man

Who can keep me satisfied



[ENSEMBLE]

Who can keep me satisfied



[DANNY]

I better shape up if I'm gonna prove



[SANDY]

You better prove that my faith is justified



[DANNY]

Are you sure?
