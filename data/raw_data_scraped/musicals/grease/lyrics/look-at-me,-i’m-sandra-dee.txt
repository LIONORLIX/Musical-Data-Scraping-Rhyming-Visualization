Look at Me, I’m Sandra Dee


[RIZZO]

Look at me, I’m Sandra Dee

Lousy with virginity

Can’t go to bed ’til I’m legally wed

I can’t, I’m Sandra Dee



Watch it, hey, I’m Doris Day

I was not brought up that way

Won’t come across, even Rock Hudson lost

His heart to Doris Day



I don’t drink or swear

I don’t, ew, rat my hair

I get ill from one cigarette

Keep your filthy paws off my silky drawers

Would you pull that stuff with Annette?

Bad boy



As for you, Troy Donahue

I know what you wanna do

You've got your crust

I’m no object of lust

I’m just plain Sandra Dee



Elvis, Elvis, let me be

Keep that pelvis far from me

Just keep your cool

Now your starting to drool

Hey, fungool, I’m Sandra Dee
