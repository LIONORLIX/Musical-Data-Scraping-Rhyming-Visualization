Rock ‘n’ Roll Party Queen


[ROGER & DOODY]

La-la-la-la, la-la-la

La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

La-la-la-la, la-la-la

Ohhh rock 'n' roll party queen



Little girl, do you know who I mean?

Pretty soon, she'll be seventeen

They tell me her name's Mary Jean

Ah-ah-ah, rock 'n' roll party queen



Friday night, and she's got a date

Goin' places, just a-stayin' out late

Droppin' dimes in the record machine

Ah-ah-ah, rock 'n' roll party queen



Ba-ba ba-ba ba-bum, oh no

Can I have a ball tonight? (Oh woah woah woah woah)

Baby, baby, can I be the one

To love you with all of my might?

Ay-yi-yi-yi



She's the girl that all the kids know

Talk about her wherever she goes

I could write a fan magazine

About my rock 'n' roll party queen



Ba-ba ba-ba ba-bum, you should see her shake, hey-ay-ay-ay

Baby, baby, don't you call it puppy love

Don't you want a true romanc??

Ay-yi-yi-yi



Rockin' and rollin', little party queen

We're gonna do th? stroll, hey, party queen

You know I love you so, my party queen

You're my rockin' and my rollin' party queen
