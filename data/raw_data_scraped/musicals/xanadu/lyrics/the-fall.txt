The Fall


I see the early glow

I hear you say hello

I watch the shadows fall

I don't see you at all



It's a lie

(I don't believe it's so)

It's a lie



I see the autumn rain

Falling on my window pane

I hear you say goodbye

I see a tear in your eye



It's a lie

(I don't believe it's so)

It's a lie

Our love couldn't go wrong

How could I know I was only dreaming

And now, now that you're gone

I will go on really believing

I take the fall



I see you slip away,

Into another day

There's no-one else around

I watch the sun go down



It's a lie

(I don't believe it's so)

It's a lie

Our love couldn't go wrong

How could I know I was only dreaming

And now, now that you're gone

I will go on really believing

I take the fall



(Instrumental break)



I take the fall



I see you in a dream

You turn and start to go

I call to you once more

Guess that I'm takin' the fall



It's a lie

(I don't believe it's so)

It's a lie

Our love couldn't go wrong

How could I know I was only dreaming

And now, now that you're gone

I will go on really believing

I take the fall



Our love couldn't go wrong

How could I know I was only dreaming

And now, now that you're gone

I will go on really believing

I take the fall
