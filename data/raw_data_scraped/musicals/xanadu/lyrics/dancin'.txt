Dancin'


Danny:  I can see it now.  Concerts, in this theater.

Classy stuff, swing music and three girls singing in tight, tight harmony!



Girls:

Anybody blue

Anybody needin' someone too

Anyone feelin' cold,

No one there

You can hold

Don't wait to get old and gray

I'm gonna blow all the clouds away

'Cos there is nothing I would rather do



Forget about the blues tonight,

Sweet thing

Forget about the rules tonight

Sweet thing

I wanna dance with you

Until the sun comes creepin' through

I wanna dance with you

I won't stop pleasin' you



Sonny:  No, no, no, no.  That kind of music went out with running boards.

I?m talking about electric guitars.  Rock and roll, man!  This is the eighties!



Guys:

Lover I want to let you know

I won't take a back seat

Ain't willin' to let you go

I won't take a back seat

Don't wanna hear what you want

It's gotta be all my way

And I'm makin' sure you stay to see



Lover

I won't take a back seat tonight

Oooh...

Lover gettin' on my two feet tonight

Oooh...

Got some dancin' to do

Got some dancin' to do

Got some dancin' to do,

Got some dancin' to do





Girls/Danny:

I wanna dance with you

Until the sun comes creepin' through



Sonny: 2,3,4



Guys:

Got some dancin' to do

Got some dancin' to do



All:

Ah...



Girls:

Forget about the blues tonight,

Sweet thing

Forget about the rules tonight

Sweet thing

I wanna dance with you

Until the sun comes creepin' through

I wanna dance with you

I won't stop pleasin' you



Guys:

Lover

I won't take a back seat tonight

Oooh...

Lover gettin' on my two feet tonight

Oooh...Got some dancin' to do

Got some dancin' to do

Got some dancin' to do,

Got some dancin' to do





All:

Ah...

Ba-Da-Pow.
