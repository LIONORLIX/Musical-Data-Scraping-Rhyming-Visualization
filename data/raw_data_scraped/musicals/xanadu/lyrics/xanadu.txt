Xanadu


OLIVIA NEWTON-JOHN:

A place where nobody dared to go

The love that we came to know

They call it Xanadu



And now

Open your eyes and see

What we have made is real

We are in Xanadu



A million lights are dancing

And there you are

A shooting star

An everlasting world

And you're here with me

Eternally



Xanadu, Xanadu,

(now we are here)

In Xanadu

Xanadu, Xanadu,

(now we are here)

In Xanadu



Xanadu, your neon lights will shine

For you, Xanadu



The love

The echoes of long ago

You needed the world to know

They are in Xanadu



The dream

That came through a million years

That lived on through all the tears

It came to Xanadu



A million lights are dancing

And there you are

A shooting star

An everlasting world

And you're here with me

Eternally



Xanadu, Xanadu,

(now we are here)

In Xanadu

Xanadu, Xanadu,

(now we are here)

In Xanadu



Now that I'm here

Now that you're near in Xanadu

Now that I'm here

Now that you're near in Xanadu

Xanadu...
