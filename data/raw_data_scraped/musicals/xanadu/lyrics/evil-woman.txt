Evil Woman


Melpomene:  Apparently, there is no success nor joy for you nor I.

And now, Clio is to be granted Xanadu!

Would that I were a god, I would smite her.



Calliope: Ooo, sister, sister!  You are such a . . .



Melpomene:

Evil woman



Calliope:

Melpomene:

Evil woman



Rolled in from another town

Hit some gold, too hot to settle down

But a fool and his money soon go separate ways

And you found a fool lyin' in a daze



Both:

Ha, ha



Melpomene:

Woman

What you gonna do

You destroyed all the virtues that the Lord gave you

It's so good that you're feelin' pain

But you better get your face on board the very next train



Both:

Hey, hey, hey, hey

Evil woman, evil woman



Melpomene:

Evil woman, hey



Calliope:

You?re an evil woman



Melpomene:

Evil woman



I know what lets do!



Calliope:  What lets?



Melpomene:  What lets use our muse powers and place a curse upon our sister.

That she falls in love with this mortal!



Both:

Hey, hey, hey, hey



Calliope: What a glorious prank.  We shall do the curse, she shall be in love!

And by Zeus? decree . . . Be put to death!



Both:

Hey, hey, hey, hey



Melpomene:  Oh, come my daughter Sirens.

Come join your mother and aunt in mean-spirited melody!



Sirens:

You?re an evil woman.



Calliope:

Evil woman how you done me wrong

But now you're trying to wail a different song



Both:

Ha, ha



Calliope:

Ah, funny how you broke me up

You made the wine now you drink a cup

I came a-runnin' every time you cried

I thought I saw love smilin' in your eyes

Ha, ha very nice to know

That you ain't got no place left to go

All:

Hey, hey, hey, hey



Sirens:

Evil woman



Melpomene:

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah



Sirens:

Evil woman



Calliope:

Not a nice lady!



Sirens:

Evil woman,



Melpomene:

Hey, hey, hey



Sirens:

Evil woman



All:

Evil Woman
