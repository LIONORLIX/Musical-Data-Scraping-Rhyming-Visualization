Whenever You're Away From Me


Danny:

No other face could take you off my mind

You're so refined

And much too kind

I have to warn you I'm never gonna set you free

'Cause I was born to love you for eternity



Whenever you're away from me

Wherever you go

You're never far away from me

I want you to know

I only have to close my eyes dear

And suddenly I'm where you are

You better never stray

'Cos I'll never be far away



Tangerine/Clio:

On every breeze I seem to hear your name



Danny:

My heart's aflame



Tangerine/Clio:

I feel the same



Both:

I'd fall apart dear

If you let the feelin' end

Don't break a heart dear

Nobody else could mend



Whenever you're away from me

Wherever you go

You're never far away from me

I want you to know

I only have to close my eyes dear

And suddenly I'm where you are

You better never stray

'Cos I'll never be far away



(Tangerine/Clio Scatting/Tap Dance)



Tangerine/Clio:

You better never stray

Better never stray

You better never stray,

'Cos I'll never be far away



Danny:

You better never stray,

'Cos I'll never be far away
