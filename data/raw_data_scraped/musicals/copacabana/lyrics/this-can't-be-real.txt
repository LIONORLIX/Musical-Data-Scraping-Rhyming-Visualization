This Can't Be Real


[Olivia:]

This can't be real

As long as I love you

How could this ever be real

As long as you're there?

Help me to feel

The nightmare's behind me

That your love will find me

Anywhere



[Barry:]

Love is what's true

The rest is illusion

What I've discovered with you

No one can steal



[Both:]

The truth isn't what it seems

The truth is our wildest dreams

Real was your kiss

But as for this

This can't be real



[Barry:]

This can't be real

So why do I love you

I know that this can't be real

Still you are there

You aren't real

But somehow you've found me

To haunt and surround me

You're everywhere



[Both:]

This isn't true

It's only illusion

What I've discovered with you

Is just an ideal



[Barry:]

This must be a dream, I know

So why do I want you so?

Is it because



[Olivia:]

Only because

This can't be real?



[Barry:]

This can't be real



[Both:]

Love is what's true

The rest is illusion

What I've discovered with you



[Olivia:]

No one can steal



[Barry:]

No one can steal



[Both:]

The truth isn't what it seems

The truth is our wildest dreams



[Barry:]

This must be a dream, I know



[Olivia:]

So why do I want you so?

Real was your kiss



[Barry:]

Is it because



[Olivia:]

Oh, but as for this



[Barry:]

Only because



[Both:]

This can't be real

This can't be real

This can't be real
