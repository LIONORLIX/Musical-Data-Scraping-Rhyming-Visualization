One real man wanted

One mister rough and tough who'll kiss me til I cry

Tall, dark and tan wanted

About this much across and just about yay high



Previous experience required

Plus a lifetime guarantee to satisfy

These ain't no kiddie toys

So boys need not apply!

One handy man wanted

Some guy who's got the tools to keep my heat on high!

One struttin' Stan wanted

One Randy Rooster who can make my feathers fly!



Extra strength and stamina desired!

If you think you've got enough to qualify...

No Peter Pan wanted

These ain't no kiddie toys
