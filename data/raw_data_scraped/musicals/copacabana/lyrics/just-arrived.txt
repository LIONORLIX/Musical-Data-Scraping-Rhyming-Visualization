Just Arrived


[Spoken:]

Her name is... Lola!

She's from Tulsa.. yeah!

Just arrived, two suitcases in hand

And a dream in her heart



Just arrived track seventeen

All the way from Tulsa Okla-nowhere

Where's her chauffeured limousine?

Where's the marching band?

Just in time to take the town

And though her knees are shaking

She's making her stand



It all starts now

I can see her name in neon

I won't allow

Anyone to disagree

Don't ask me how

But before too long

She'll be on some marquee

New York or bust!

She's just arrived!



Just arrived track seventeen

(Just arrived track twenty four)

All the way from Tulsa Oklahoma

(All the way from St. Paul, Minnesota)

(All the way from Fargo, North Dakota)

Though she's still a little green

(Marching through the open door)

When she left, she left her past behind

(Wonder what she'll find)

Just imagine, here she is the girl from work

(The soda jerk)

(The groc'ry clerk)



The kid they all made fun of

Is one of a kind



It all starts now

Look who's currently appearing

This girl's a wow

All the magazines agree

She'll take her bow

And the world will all be cheering, wait and see

New York or bust

She's just arrived



Hey!

(Hey! which way's uptown?)

Somebody said they're auditioning for "south pacific"

(Where's the palace?)

Say!

(Hey!, she's from Dallas!)

Somewhere I read they need lookers and she looks terrific

(That one's Alice!)

This is her moment

(Hey, world here I come!)

She knows it she can taste it

And she sure ain't gonna waste it

Cause it's time she faced it



It all starts now

(Right now!)

I can see her name in neon

(I can see her name in blazing neon)

This girl's a wow

(And how!)

All the magazines agree

(No way anyone would dare to disagree)

She'll take her bow

(Oh, wow!)

And before too long she'll be on some marquee



Gathering dust

She just survived

Now, New York or bust

She's just arrived!

Hey world

She's just arrived!
