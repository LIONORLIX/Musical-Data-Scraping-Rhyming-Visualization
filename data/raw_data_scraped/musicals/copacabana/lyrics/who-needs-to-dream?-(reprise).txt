Who Needs to Dream? (Reprise)


STEPHEN:

Who needs to dream when there is you?



SAMANTHA:

What's gotten in to you? Why are you looking at me like this!?



STEPHEN:

Who needs a heaven to look forward to?



SAMANTHA:

Stop singing!



STEPHEN:

For my whole life through...



SAMANTHA:

It is kind of pretty, though...
