Dancin' Fool


When I hear a band blowin' basie

I can count on losing my cool

Take me where the rhythm is racy

Let me be a dancin' fool



Some prefer the caf europa

Sipping dubonnet on a stool

Me, I get my kicks at the copa

That's where i'm a dancin' fool

I'll show you some moves

Smooth as satin

And others they don't teach in school

When that crooner starts in to scattin'

Just give me a chance an'

My tuxedo pants an'

Presto!

I'm a dancin' fool



When those trumpets blare, man

I ain't got a care man

I'm like fred astaire, man

Cool!



Just give me a chance an'

My tuxedo pants an'



Presto!

I'm a dancin' fool!
