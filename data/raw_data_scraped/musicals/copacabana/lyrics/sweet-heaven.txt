Sweet Heaven


Hey down there!

Look at me now

I'm flyin' high

Here I am

Heaven knows how

Heaven knows why

Guess I'm just a lucky guy



Sweet heaven I'm in love again

Sweet heaven I'm in love again

You came along

Now what can I do?

I only want to be with you



Sweet heaven here I go again

I'm hooked from head to toe again

One minute I'm so lonely and then

Oh, sweet heaven



Hey, babe

Now that I found you

Life's a song

Say babe

Where you been hidin'?

I've been waiting so long



Sweet heaven I'm in love again

So totally in love again

I'll shout it everywhere I go

I'll sing it on the radio

I want the whole world to know

Sweet heaven I'm in love again



Sweet heaven I'm in love again

Incredibly in love again

You came along now what can I do

I only want to be with you



So happy to be hooked again

My saturdays are booked again

One minute I'm so lonely and then

Oh sweet heaven



Hey world

Stop what you're doin'

I've got news

Say world

Stop all the presses

I've stopped singing the blues



Oh brother

I'm in love again

So totally in love again

I'll shout it everywhere I go

I'll sing in on the radio

I want the whole world to know

Sweet heaven I'm in love

Again
