Bravo


LOLA:

Somewhere he waits, somewhere out there.

And soon he'll run to me and save the day.

For what you've done to me he'll make you pay.

Somewhere he waits, scoundrels,beware!

Out of the blue,he'll appear, El Bravo!

Soon you will tremble in fear. El Bravo!

Friend of the weak and the poor and the meek,

El Bravo! El Bravo!



PIRATE CAPTAIN:

Pirates, have your way with her!



LOLA:

Do what you will, cowards and swine.

Attack and bully me, and crack your whips.

My heart is his; his strengh is mine!

Where is the man I adore? El Bravo!

Donde esta mi amor? El Bravo!

friend of the weak and the poor and the meek,



PIRATES:

And the chained and the pained;

and the soon to be dead, and the sad and the sick--



LOLA:

Darling quick! it's the nick of time!



PIRATES:

MERMAIDS:

ALL:

El Bravo!



PIRATES:

Where can your lover boy be? El Bravo!

Maybe he stopped for some tea, El Bravo!

Maybe he's drunk or perhaps he's depressed,

or he's ill or he's dead, or he's still getting dressed, El Bravo!



LOLA:
