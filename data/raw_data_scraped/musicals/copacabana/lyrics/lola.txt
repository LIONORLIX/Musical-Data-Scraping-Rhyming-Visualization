OK...what we need her is a little inspiration let me see



Lola sweeter then a cherry cola I look at her and I lose control-a



Oh you think this is funny.well this is hard work. Ok let me see



Lola Would she stop me if I stole a kiss like this



Lola if only your name were Sue 'cause Sue rhymes with skies of blue and morning dew and I love
