Who Am I Kidding?


SAM:

the kid is heading for a crash,

he'll run into Castelli there,

they'll shoot him in the belly there,

they'll cut him up and stuff him in the trash!



holy cow Havana!

Havana I'm going to Havana!

what else am I supposed to do?

I need a gun I need a pill

I need a map I need a will

I'll save his neck and Lola's too!



Who am I kidding?

I'm no hero I'm just a average

S.O.B. this is the kind of job for someone muscle

-bound and kind of witless and besides,

it scares me shitless! who am I kidding?

I'm no hero



DOORMAN:

SAM:

DOORMAN:

SAM:

GLADYS:

the kid don't know him like we do before

he finished wit'cha well you'll never know

what hit'cha and it ain't a pretty pit'cha I tell you!



SAM:

Alright,alright, I'm going!

I'm going that settles it, I'm going!

I'll teach you not to mess with me!

I'll give him this!



GLADYS:

SAM:

GLADYS:

BOTH:

SAM:

Who am I kidding? I'm no youngster.



GLADYS:

You're only mature like an old cheese.



SAM:

It takes me hours just to pee.



GLADYS:

You peed enough already.



SAM:

This ain't the kind of job. For some old poop like me.



GLADYS:

SAM:

I'm no hero.



ALL:

SAM:

GLADYS:
