Ay Caramba


I hear the congas I hear tymbalis my shoes

leave the ground and the world spins around !

Ay Caramba!





They bang the bangos they click the clavis my lips start to-(kiss) and my hips start to-(bump) !Ay Caramba!





Oh those persuasive percussive Caribbean rhythms

the more I resist the more they insist

Can't stop the congas,tymbalis the bongos,

the clavis and Ay! Ay! Ay! !Ay Caramba!



I hear the rumba (you hear the rumba?)

and then the mambo (you want to mambo?)

wait, I think you should know Latin drums make me go

!Ay Caramba!



They shake maracas (I shake maracas)

I go bananas (you like bananas?)

We start having fun but before it's all done

!Ay Caramba!



Oh those crazy caressing Caribbean rhythms

to some it's "so what" to me it's so hot

Can't stop the rumba, the samba the mambo,

the bambo and Ay! Ay ! Ay! !Ay Caramba!





Can't stop the congas,tymbalis the bongos,

the clavis the rumba, the samba, the mambo, the bambo and

Ay! Ay ! Ay! !Ay Caramba!
