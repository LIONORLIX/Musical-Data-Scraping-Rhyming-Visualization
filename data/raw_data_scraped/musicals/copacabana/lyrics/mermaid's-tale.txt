Mermaid's Tale


VOICEOVER:

Se?ores ? se?oritas, ladies and gentlemen, Rico Castelli is proud to present 'El Bravo'



MERMAIDS:

Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah!

Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah!

Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah!

Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah!

long ago in a simpler time when pirates ruled the sea,

there lived a brave and righteous man

Who fought to keep men free.

Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah!

He fell in love with a maiden fair,

A girl with emerald eyes then one day

pirates stole ashore and took her as their prize

Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah!

the girl with emerald eyes

Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah!

they dragged her screaming to their ship!

Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah!

they introduced her to the whip!

Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah!

they drank and swore and made her party to their sins

and there our tale... ...begins
