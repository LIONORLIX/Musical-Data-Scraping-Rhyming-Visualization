Who Needs to Dream?


You were in my dreams

Always in my dreams

That was long before

I ever saw you standing there

When I felt afraid

Of the choice I made

I would close my eyes

And hope my dreams would comfort me

But now I'm free



Who needs to dream when there is you?

Who needs a heaven to look forward to?

For my whole life through

Who needs to dream?

You're my dream come true



In my fantasy

You believed in me

And as long as you were there

Then I believed in me

Now suddenly



Who needs to dream when there is you?

Who needs a heaven to look forward to?

For my whole life through

Who needs to dream?

You're my dream come true



Now you are my dream

You are my only dream

I'll hold you in my heart forever

Who needs to dream?

Who needs to dream?

When I see you there

Then I see my every dream come true



Who needs to dream when there is you?

Who needs a heaven?

For my whole life through

Who needs to dream?

You're my dream come true

Every dream

All come true

My dream come true!
