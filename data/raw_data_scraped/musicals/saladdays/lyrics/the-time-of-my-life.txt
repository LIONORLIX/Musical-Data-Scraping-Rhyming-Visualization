The Time Of My Life


It’s true I’ve been led an amazing dance,

But why should I ever complain?

If I could be given a second chance

I’d live it all over again.

Look at the weather and look at me,

We’re both in a summery haze,

We’re young and we’re green as the leaf on the tree

For these are our Salad Days.



Summer and sunshine and falling in love,

All the sadness was foolish and vain.

It has melted away in the heat of the day

And my heart is so full there’s no room there for pain.

Summer and sunshine and falling in love

They can cut through despair like a knife

There is joy in the air so begone with dull care

I am having the time of my life.



This month has been enchanted

And it’s all because of you

For I have been transplanted

To a world that’s exciting and new.



Summer and sunshine and falling in love

With a lover who made me his wife

For my heart I can say on this glorious day,

I am having the time of my life.



Summer and sunshine and falling in love

With a lover who made me his wife

For my heart I can say on this glorious day,

I am having the time of my life.
