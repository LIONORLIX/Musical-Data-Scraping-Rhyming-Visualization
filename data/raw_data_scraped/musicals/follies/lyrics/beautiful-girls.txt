Beautiful Girls


ROSCOE:

Hats off,

Here they come, those

Beautiful girls.

That's what

You've been waiting for.

Nature never fashioned

A flower so fair.

No rose can compare-

Nothing respectable

Half so delectable.

Cheer them

In their glory,

Diamonds and pearls,

Dazzling jewels

By the score.

This is what beauty can be.

Beauty celestial,

The best, you'll

Agree:

All for you,

These beautiful girls!

(The former Weismann Girls enter and parade.)

Careful,

Here's the home of

Beautiful girls,

Where your

Reason is undone.

Beauty

Can't be hindered

From taking its toll.

You may lose control.

Faced with these Loreleis,

What man can moralize?

(The men join him.)

Caution,

On your guard with

Beautiful girls,

Flawless charmers

Every one.

(The women join them.)

This is how Samson was shorn;

Each in her style a

Delilah

Reborn,

Each a gem,

A beautiful diadem

Of beautiful-welcome them-

ROSCOE:

These beautiful

ALL:

Girls!
