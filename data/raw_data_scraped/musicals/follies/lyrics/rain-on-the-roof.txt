Rain on the Roof


EMILY and THEODORE WHITMAN:

Listen to the rain on the roof go

EMILY:

Pit-pitty-pat--

THEODORE WHITMAN:

Pit-pitty-pat--

EMILY and THEODORE WHITMAN:

Pitty--

Sit, kitty cat,

We won't get home for hours.

Relax and

Listen to the rain on the roof go

EMILY:

Plunk-planka-plink-

THEODORE WHITMAN:

Plunk-planka-plink-

EMILY and THEODORE WHITMAN:

Planka-

Let's have a drink

And shelter from the showers.

Rain, rain, don't go away,

Fill up the sky.

Rain through the night.

We'll stay

Cozy and dry.

Listen to the rain on the roof go

Pit-pitty-pat-

(They kiss.)

Plunk-a-plink-

(kiss)

Plank-

(kiss)

Pity that

It's not a hurricane.

Listen "plink" to the

(kiss kiss)

Lovely rain.
