Who's That Woman?


STELLA:

(As the other women gather around her.)

Who's that woman? I know her well,

All decked out head to toe.

She lives life like a carousel:

Beau after beau after beau.

Nightly, daily,

Always laughing gaily,

Seems I see her everywhere I go.

Oh--

Who's that woman?

I know I know that woman,

So clever, but ever so sad.

Love, she said, was a fad.

The kind of love that she couldn't make fun of

She'd have none of.

Who's that woman.

That cheery, weary woman

Who's dressing for yet one more spree?

Each day I see her pass

In my looking-glass--

Lord, Lord, Lord, that woman is me!



SALLY, PHYLLIS, HATTIE, EMILY, SOLANGE:Mirror, mirror, on the wall,

Who's the saddest gal in town?

Who's been riding for a fall?

Whose Lothario let her down?

Mirror, mirror, answer me:

Who is she who plays the clown?

Is she out each night till three?

Does she laugh with too much glee?

On reflection, she'd agree.

Mirror, mirror,

Mirror, mirror,

Mirror; mirror...

(The women begin their old routine;

their younger selves take over.)

STELLA: WOMEN and GIRLS:

Who's that woman? Mirror, mirror,

I mean I've seen that woman on the wall,

Who's joking but choking Who's the saddest gal in town?

Back tears.

All those glittering years Who's been riding for a fall?

She thought that

Love was o matter of "Hi, there!" Love was a matter of "Hi, there!"

"Kiss me!" "'Bye, there!"

"Kiss me!" "Bye, there!"

Who's that woman, Mirror, mirror,

That cheery, weary woman, answer me.

Who's dressing for yet one Who is she who plays the

more spree? Clown?

The vision's getting blurred.

Isn't that absurd?

Lord. lord. Lord! Lord, Lord, lord!

Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord!

That woman is me.



Mirror, mirror!

That woman is me.

Mirror, mirror!

That woman is me! Mirror, mirror! Mirror!
