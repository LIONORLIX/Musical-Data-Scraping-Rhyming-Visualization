Don't Look At Me


SALLY

Ben, it's me.

Now, folks, we bring you

Di-rect from Phoenix,

Live and in person.

Sally Durant!

Here she is at last,

Twinkle in her eye,

Hot off the press.

Strictly a mess,

Nevertheless...

(smiling nervously)

Hi, Ben...

(before he can respond)

No, don't look at me-

Please, not just yet.

Why am I here? This it crazy!

No, don't look at me-

I know that face.

You're trying to place

The name...

Say something, Ben, anything.

No, don't talk to me.

Ben, I forget;

What were we like? It's so hazy!

Look at these people.

Aren't they eerie?

Look at this party.

Isn't it dreary?

I'm so glad I came.

BEN:

Can I look now? (She nods, smiling nervously) Yes, it's possible

You might be Sally. Did you fall asleep at Toscanini broadcasts?

(She nods.) Did you eat Baby Ruths for breakfast?

SALLY:

I still do sometimes. Oh, Ben, you're just the way

I knew you'd be. You make me feel like I was nineteen

and the four of us were going on the town.

BOTH:

So-

I just look at us...

SALLY:

Fat...

BEN:

Turning gray...

BOTH:

Still playing games,

Acting crazy.

SALLY

Isn't it awful?

BEN:

God. how depressing-

BOTH:

Me, I'm a hundred.

You, you're a blessing-

I'm so glad I came!

BEN:

What we need is a drink.
