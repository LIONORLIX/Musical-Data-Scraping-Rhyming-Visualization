BUDDY and YOUNG BUDDY:

(Ben. Sally and Phyllis join Buddy.)

BUDDY:

God, the four of us together back here.

Hey. up there!

Way up there!

Whaddaya say, up there?



I see it all. It's like a movie in my head that play and plays.

It isn't just the bad things I remember It's the whole show.



Waiting around for the girls upstairs:

After the curtain came down.

Money In my pocket to spend.

"Honey, could you maybe get a friend for my friend!"

BEN:

Hearing the sound of the girls above

Dressing to go on the town.

BUDDY:

Clicking heels on steel and cement,

BEN:

Picking up the giggles floating down through the vent,

BOTH:

Goddamnedest hours that I ever spent

Were waiting for the girls

Upstairs

BUDDY:

Hey, up there!

BEN:

Way up there! .

BOTH:

Whaddaya say, up there!

BEN:

That's where the keys hung and

That's where you picked up your mail.

BUDDY:

I remember:

Me and Ben.

Me and Ben.

We'd come around at ten.

Me and Ben.

And hang around the wings

Watching things

With what-the-hell-was-his-name.

You know, the old guy?

Max! I remember...

Anyway,

There we'd stay

Until the curtain fell.

And when the curtain tell.

Then all hell broke:

Girls on the run

And scenery flying,

Doors slamming left and right

BEN:

Girls in their un-

Dies, blushing but trying

Not to duck out of sight.

BOTH:

Girls by the hun-

Dreds waving and crying.

"See you tomorrow night!"

Girls looking frazzled and girls looking great,

Girls in a frenzy to get to a date,

Girls like a madhouse and two of them late...

And who had to wait?

And wait...

And wait...

And

wait...

PHYLLIS:

Waiting around for the boys downstairs,

Stalling as long as we dare.

Which dress from my wardrobe of two?

(One of them was borrowed and the other was blue.)

SALLY:

Holding our ground for the boys below,

Fussing around with our hair

PHYLLIS:

Giggling, wriggling out of our tights,

SALLY:

Chattering and clattering down all of those flights-

BOTH:

God, I'd forgotten there ever were nights

Of waiting for the boys

Downstairs.

BUDDY:

You up there!

SALLY:

Down in a minute!

BEN:

You two up there!

PHYLLIS:

Just keep your shirts on!

BEN and BUDDY:

Aren't you through up there?

SALLY and PHYLLIS:

(Their younger counterparts appear)

YOUNG BUDDY:

Slipped a fin

To what-the-hell-is-his-name,

You know, the doorman.

YOUNG BUDDY and YOUNG BEN:

That we'd go to Tony's. I told you Tony's?

ALL GIRLS:

Then Ben mentioned Tony's. I never said Tony's

ALL MEN:

Well, someone said Tony's. When's Ben mentioned Tony's?

There's dancing at Tony's-- It's ritzy at Tony's--

All right, then, we'll go! All right, then, we'll go!

(The young counterparts leave.)

BUDDY:

Waiting around for the girls upstairs,

Weren't we chuckleheads then?

BEN:

Very young and very old hat--

Everybody has to go through stages like that.

SALLY, PHYLLIS, BEN and BUDDY:

Waiting around for the girls upstairs--

Thank you but never again.

Life was fun but oh, so intense

Everything was possible and nothing made sense

Back there when one of the major events

Was waiting for the girls,

Waiting for the girls.

Waiting for the girls.

Waiting for the girls,

Waiting for the girls

Upstairs.
