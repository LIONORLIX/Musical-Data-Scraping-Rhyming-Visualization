Broadway Baby


HATTIE:

I'm just a

Broadway Baby.

Walking off my tired feet.

Pounding Forty-Second Street

To be in a show.

Oh...

Broadway Baby,

Learning how to sing and dance,

Waiting for that one big chance

To be in a show.Oh...Gee.'

I'd like to be

On some marquee,

All twinkling lights,

A spark

To pierce the dark

From Battery Park

To Washington Heights.

Someday, maybe,

All my dreams will be repaid.

Heck, I'd even play the maid

To bc in a show.

Hey, Mr. Producer,

I'm talking to you, sir;

I don't need a lot,

Only what I got,

Plus a tube of greasepaint

And a follow-spot!

I'm a Broadway Baby,

Slaving at the five-and-ten,

Dreaming of the great day whcn

I'll be in a show.Oh...

Broadway Baby,

Making rounds all afternoon,

Eating at a greasy spoon

To have on my dough.

Oh...AtMy tiny flat

There's just my cat.

A bed and o chair

Still

I'll stick it till

I'm on a bill

All over Times Square.

Someday, maybe,

If I stick it long enough,

I may get to strut my stuff

Working for a nice man

Like a Ziegfeld or a Weismann

HATTIE, THE WHITMANS, SOLANGE:

In a great big

Broadway show!
