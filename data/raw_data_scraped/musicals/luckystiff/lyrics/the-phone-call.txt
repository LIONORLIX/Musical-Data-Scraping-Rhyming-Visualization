The Phone Call


VOICE OVER(spoken)

Welcome to Nice Airport!

Ground transportation for visitors proceeding to Monte Carlo is available on the lower level *fades*



VINNY(spoken)

Uh, hello?



VINNY(sung)

Mary Alice?

Can you hear me?

Listen honey, I'm calling to tell you

There's a problem

Are you sitting?

Well, I won't be home for dinner tonight

You know Nicky?

Rita's husband?

Well I think he is planning to kill me!



Mary Alice

It's not funny

And I won't be home for dinner tonight!

Don't hold the meatloaf

Don't toss the salad

Don't talk to strangers

(And make up some excuse for mom)



Call all my patients

Break my appointments

Please, Mary Alice just be calm!



Are you finished?

Are you better?

Mary Alice, you're overreacting!

Honey bunny, are you crying?



It's your birthday?!

Gee, I'm sorry.

Mary Alice, it's only a birthday!

So you're fourty

I'm in danger!

And I can't come home for dinner



So blow out the candles

Open the presents

Please, Mary Alice

I'm in Europe

In an airport

With no wallet, no cards, and no money

With my sister- who is crazy

And who's got me in an awful jam!



So the answer, Mary Alice

Is I won't be home for dinner!

Mary Alice-

Mary Alice?



Damn.
