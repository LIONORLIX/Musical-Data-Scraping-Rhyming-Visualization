Something Funny's Going On


[Cast] Something funny's going on

and it isn't very pretty.

This is how it all began

with the murder of a man.

BANG



[Rita] Oops!



[Cast] In Atlantic City.

New Jersey.

Something funny's going on

there's a lot we haven't told yet



[Women]There's a fortune



[Men] and a chase



[Cast]and a lovely foreign place.



[Dominique] Lovely foregin place.



[Men] Lovely lovely



[Women] Foreign Foreign



[Cast] Place. Ahhh..

And the body isn't cold yet.

In New Jersey.

The story that you're about to hear

is strange we know

and things like this don't happen everyday

but there's a little saying

and it's appropos

Where there's a will,

where there's a will

where there's a way

there's a way!

Ahhh!



[Voice of Tony Hendon. Spoken.]

Dear Nephew Harry this is my last will and testament.

I hope it finds you in better health than it does me! Ha.



[Cast] Something funny's going on

There's an awful lot of action



[Dominique] And a physical attraction



[Annabel] And a lot of dogs!



[Cast] Woof woof!



[Vinnie] There's a fourtune to be won.



[Rita] And a woman with a gun.



[Luigi] And the body of a man.



[Cast] And an axe about to fall.



[Harry] On one unsuspecting fellow



[Cast] In the middle of it all.

In England, In may.

With the day already gone

Something funny, funny

Very very funny.

Woof, Woof, Bang



[Rita] Oops!



[Cast] Is going on!
