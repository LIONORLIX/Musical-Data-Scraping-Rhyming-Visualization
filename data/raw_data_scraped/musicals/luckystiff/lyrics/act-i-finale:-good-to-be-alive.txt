Act I Finale: Good To Be Alive


Man:

(spoken)

Harry, you?re a winner!



Harry:

(spoken)

It?s my uncle?s infallible system! Thank you, thank you!



Annabelle:

(spoken)

How can you do this?

How can you stand there watching that silly ball spin around

when there are world problems that need solving?

You are the most selfish person I?ve ever met!



Harry:

(spoken)

Now, you listen, for the first time in my life I?m on a bloody winning streak- my luck has changed!

And I?m not about to give up the one and only chance I?ve ever had.

Not to a pack of mangy, flea ridden mongrels, and certainly not to you.

(sung)

I?m in the world

I?m on the spin

From here on out I know I?ll win



Man:

He?s got the touch



Woman:

He?s got the knack



Man 2:

He?s betting three



All:

He?s hot on black

If this is it, you must admit

It makes a body cry

Oh-



Man:

(spoken)

Mr. Witherspoon, you?ve won!



All:

It?s good to be

Alive



Rita:

(spoken)

Mr. Witherspoon, you?re dead!
