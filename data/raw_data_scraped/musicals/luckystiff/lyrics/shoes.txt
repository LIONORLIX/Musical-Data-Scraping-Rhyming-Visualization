Shoes


some shoes go dancing every night

some shoes go living it up left and right

places with music playing

laughter and noise and wine

hundreds of shoes all swaying

not mine



some shoes take cruises far away

the skies are tropical blue never gray

toes up against the railing

watching the water shine

hundreds of shoes gone sailing



right now they're off exploring

some exotic streams

champagne pouring in the moonlight

now they're dancing feet to feet



i see them tiptoe lightly up a winding stair

slipped off nightly in the darkness

next to someone else's pair



you won't catch my shoes on the town

they're sturdy, sensible things: basic brown

not ones to fly away in

dance or make love or cruise

wish i could spend one day in

someone else's shoes
