Fancy Meeting You Here


Harry: Goodnight Uncle Anthony

Rita: Wait, I thought I killed him

I must have nicked him instead.

The paper said he was dead

Was that a fake? Or a mistake?

God I thought I killed him. I didn't kill him.

He's over there. He's in a wheelchair! Oh!

Tony! Tony! Tony! Oh my god! I'm a mess!

I need a comb! Where's my rouge?

Let me get rid of these stupid glasses.



Hi. Fancy meeting you here. Hello. Long time no see

Is it really you? Yes it's really me.

Please. I know what you're thinking. You're hurt. I'm hurting too.

So I jumped the gun, maybe so did you.

I'm changed. I'm not so jealous

You've changed, you're much more settled

We're here, and if you're willing to try, so am I

Tony so am I

Okay, I know I shot you, but you cheated on me.

Can't we call it even, no, no, no, no, please. Hear me out

You are the only man I've ever loved

And I am the only woman who could make you happy.

Let's not throw that away, Tony, Especially now.

We're in Europe, like we planned, with the money

And we've got the rest of our lives ahead of us.



Yes I can see the future, can you?

Two lives entwined

Maybe I'm the fool, maybe I'm just blind

But now all the worse is over, it took some thinking of

Think of we can do here. We can start anew here.

Fancy meeting you here, Tony, my love.
