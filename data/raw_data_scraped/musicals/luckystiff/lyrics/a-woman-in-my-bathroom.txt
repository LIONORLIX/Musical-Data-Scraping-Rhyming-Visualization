A Woman in My Bathroom


Cue: ?Just because we slept together does not mean we are on a first name basis.?



There's a woman in my bathroom in a sheet

The most aggravating girl I ever knew.

After driving me insane

Now she's off to catch a plane

Thanks to you!

I've had people pointing pistols at my head

I've been hounded and harassed by god knows who.

I have nearly lots my wits

And I still can't call it quits

Thanks to you!



Thanks to you my life is upside down and inside out

And I have this awful feeling you'd say,

?That's what life is all about?



And here's this woman in my bathroom in a slip

Getting dressed, going on her way

Thanks to you. Here we are.

Thanks to you. I've come so far, Uncle.

Tell me. How to tell her.

To stay.
