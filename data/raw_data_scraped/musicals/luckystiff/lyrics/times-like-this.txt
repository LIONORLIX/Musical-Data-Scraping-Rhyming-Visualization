Times Like This


ANNABEL



All I have to say is

I am happy to be sitting here

Doing what is meaningful to me



Working on behalf

of the universal dog home

Not barking up a stranger's tree



Now my idea of company would be....



A friendly face

The kind of face

That melts you with a grin

The kind of eyes that welcome you

The minute you walk in

A tender glance

You simply can't refuse



Times like this, a girl could use...a dog.



He listens when you tell him things

There's nothing you can't say

And unlike certain people

You can teach him how to stay



And if the world

is giving you the blues

He cheers you up

by chewing up the news



It's things like that

That make you chose...a dog



Other people need

Romance, dancing, playing around

Other people need constant fun

Well I'm not one

I have my feet on the ground



Give me...a quiet night

A stack of books

A tuna melt on rye

A simple walk together

Underneath the starry sky



And, suddenly,

the night is something grand

And all because

There's someone special there



Who's gazing at the view

His head upon...your shoes



At times like this

I sure could use....

A dog
