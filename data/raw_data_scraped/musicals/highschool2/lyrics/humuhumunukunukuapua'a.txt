HUMUHUMUNUKUNUKUAPUA'A


[Ryan]

A long time ago in a land far away

Lived the pineapple princess, Tiki

She was sweet as a peach, in a pineapple way,

But so sad she hardly speaky



Still, If you want to listen well,

You'll hear her secret wish.



[Sharpay]

(Aloha, everybody, my name is Tiki! )



I long to free a truly remarkable fish,

My sweet prince.



Humuhumunukunukua'Pua'A,

Makihiki malahini-who

Humuhumunukunukua'Pua'A, Ooh.

Hawana wakawakawakaniki pu pu pu



(Ryan, the fog! )



[Ryan]

She dreams of a boy, who is under a spell

That has left him all wet and scaly.



[Sharpay and Ryan]

I sing from my heart of the power of love,

Just a girl with a ukulele.



[Sharpay]

Come to me, my sweet one, and be still

I'll grasp your tail and stroke each tender grill

My sweet prince.



Humuhumunukunukua'Pua'A,

Makihiki malahini-who

Humuhumunukunukua'Pua'A, Ooh.

Hawana wakawakawakaniki pu pu pu



[Ryan, Sharpay, and the Girls]

The clouds turned grey, and the big sky cried,

And the ocean had a fit.



[Sharpay]

(Ryan, where is my ocean!? )



[Ryan, Sharpay, and the Girls]

Then the wind went whoosh, and thunder cracked,

And mighty mount Fufu spit.



[Sharpay]

Mighty Mount Fufu spit!



[Sharpay and Ryan]

T-T-T-Tiki T-Tiki

Wanna speaky, speaky, speaky with the mighty spirit Fufu

T-T-T-Tiki T-Tiki

Wanna speaky, speaky, speaky

So words I will not mince.



[Sharpay]

Wanna speaky, speaky, speaky

So words I will not mince.

Please make a man of my fresh fish prince



(Vocal sound effects and gurgling)



[Sharpay singing in a male voice]

I'm Prince Humuhumunukunukua'Pua'A

Amakahiki malahini who



[Sharpay]

(With me! )

Humuhumunukunukua'Pua'A, Ooh

Hawana wakawakawakaniki pu pu pu

Everybody!



[All]

Humuhumunukunukua'Pua'A,

Makihiki malahini-who

Humuhumunukunukua'Pua'A, Ooh.

Hawana wakawakawakaniki pu pu pu
