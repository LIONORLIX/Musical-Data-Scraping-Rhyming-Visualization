Bet On It


Everybodies always talking at me.

Evreybodies tryin' to get in my head.

I wanna listen to my own heart talkin'.

I need to count of myself instead.



Did you ever...

Lose yourslef to get what you want?

Did you ever...

Get on a ride and wanna get off?

Did you ever...

Push away the ones you should of held close?

Did you ever let go?

Did you ever not know?



Im not gonna stop that's who i am.

I give it all i got that is my plan.

Will I find What I lost

you know you can.

Bet on it.

Bet on it.

Bet on it.

Bet on it.

(Bet On Me)



I'm gonna make it right.

That is the way.

To turn my life around.

Today is the day.

And i'm the type of guy who means what i say.

Bet on it.

Bet on it.

Bet on it.

Bet on it.



How will i know if theres a path worth taking?

Should i question every move i make?

Of all lost's my heart is breaking.

I don't wanna make the same mistakes.



Did you ever...

Doubt your dream will never come true?

Did yoiu ever..

Blame the world that never blamed you?

I won't ever...

Try to live a lie again.



I don't wanna win this game if I can't play it my way.



Im not gonna stop that's who i am.

I give it all i got that is my plan.

Will I find What I lost

you know you can.

Bet on it.

Bet on it.

Bet on it.

Bet on it.

(Bet On Me)



I'm gonna make it right.

That is the way.

To turn my life around.

Today is the day.

Am i the type of guy who means what i say?

Bet on it.

Bet on it.

Bet on it.

Bet on it.
