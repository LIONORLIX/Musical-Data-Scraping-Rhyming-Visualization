straight up in the post

Taylor & Martha:



And burning someone?s toast.





Jason:



I needed Benjamins, but



this ain?t worth the stress





Kelsi:



Maybe there?s a better way



to fix this greasy mess





Troy:



We?re a champion team,



a well-oiled machine,



and we?ve faced tougher



problems than this.



I know it?s a grind, but



I?m sure we can find



a way to have fun while



we get this job done.



We?ve got to work, work



to work this out





Troy and Gabriella:



We?ll make things right



the sun will shine



If we work, work



there?ll be no doubt



We can still save the summer
