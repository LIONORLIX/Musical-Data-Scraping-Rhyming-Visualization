Blue Crystal


Was it three days?

Only three days?

That's amazing.

All that way in three days?

That's amazing.



I only went because of you.

I went to buy you something beautiful.

It was a long exhausting trip,

but I figured you were worth it.

Stil, only three days, that's perfectly amazing.



I went to the moon and back.

And you know what they've got up there?

blue crystal.



I met a man on the moon,

who sit's around all day,

and he shapes,

blue crystal.



He's got a furnace and a blower,

and a mallet and a chisel,

and he shapes,

blue crystal.



So I said, "I want a present, for a very special lady that you can't find in a store"

So he sold me eight goblets,

and there aren't any more in the whole wide world.



Yes I've been to the moon,

and I brought you back,

Blue Crystal
