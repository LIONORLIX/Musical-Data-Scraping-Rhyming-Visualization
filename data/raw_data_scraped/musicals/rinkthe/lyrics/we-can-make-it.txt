We Can Make It


People may hurt us.

We can take it.

Here comes a bad day.

We can shake it.

I'm with you.

You're with me.

We can make it.

Some little quarel,

We'll get through it.

Love isn't easy.

We can do it.

You and me.

Wait and see.

We can make it.

Long as I know you're trying.

Long as I know you care.

Long as we pull together we can do anything, anything, anywhere.

I have you.

You have me.

We can make it.

Right to the end of always, down to the finish line.

We can make it fine



They never built a tower

We were too weak to climb.

Long as I know you're trying.

Long as I know you care.

Long as we pull together we'll take on anything, anything, anywhere.

I have you.

You have me.

We can make it.
