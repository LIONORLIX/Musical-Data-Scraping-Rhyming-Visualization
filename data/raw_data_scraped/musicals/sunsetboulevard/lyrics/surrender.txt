Surrender


NORMA

No more wars to fight

White flags fly tonight

You are out of danger now

Battlefield is still

Wild poppies on the hill

Peace can only come when you surrender



Here the tracers fly

Lighting up the sky

But I'll fight on to the end

Let them send their armies

I will never bend

I won't see you now 'til I surrender

I'll see you again when I surrender



Now don't you give me a fancy price just because I'm rich.



JOE

Look, lady, you've got the wrong man.

I had some trouble with my car, I just pulled into your driveway.



NORMA

Get out.



JOE

O.K. And I'm sorry you lost your friend.



NORMA

Get out of here.



JOE

Haven't I seen you somewhere before?



NORMA

Or shall I call my servant?



JOE

Aren't you Norma Desmond? You used to be in pictures.

You used to be big.



NORMA

I am big. It's the pictures that got small.



Once upon a time

Not long ago

The head of any studio

Knew how and when to play his aces

Now they put some

Talentless unknown

Beneath their sacred microphone

We didn't need words

We had faces



Yes, they took all the idols and smashed them

The Fairbanks, the Gilberts, the Valentinos

They trampled on what was divine

They threw away the gold of silence

When all they needed was this face of mine



JOE

Hey! Don't blame me, I'm just a writer.
