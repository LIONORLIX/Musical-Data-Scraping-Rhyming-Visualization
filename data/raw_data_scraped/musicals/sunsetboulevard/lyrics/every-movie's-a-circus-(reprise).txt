Every movie's a circus

On the wire without a net



JOANNA

Coffee?



MYRON

I'm up too early

Shooting at seven

I gotta go

BOY

What's wrong?



GIRL

Can't get a screen test

Don't you hate it

When a yes-man says no?



ALL

Movies



GIRL

Good part?



BOY

I'm a policeman

"Hands up, punk!"

That's all I say



ACTOR

First time you've worked on the lot there



ACTRESS

I must say R.K.O. are O.K.

BOY

Then what?

He pressed a button

Out of the wall

Fell a four-poster bed

MYRON

Busy?



JOANNA

They shot my screenplay

Isn't that great?

No, they shot the thing dead

Every movie's a circus

On the wire without a net

Lonely?

That's how I like it.

Yeah, it's some studio smartass

You know I'm famous for being polite

Guess what?

I'm getting married

Congratulations

Fact is, we were just leaving

She's been stood up by some uppity hack

It's this movie I'm shooting

You first assistant?

More like a slave

But this is a circus movie as well

Problems, nothing but problems

Animals, actors

Two kinds of hell

Every movie's a circus

On the wire without a net

Well hello, Mr. Gillis

You two have met?

BETTY

What's going on here?



BARMAN

Artie, they're calling you back.



BETTY

I just reread "Blind Windows"

It needs some real re-working, of course

If we fixed up the opening



ARTIE

Call up the wrangler

Pay off the horse
