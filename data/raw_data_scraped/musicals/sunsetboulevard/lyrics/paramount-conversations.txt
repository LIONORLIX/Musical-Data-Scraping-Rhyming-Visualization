Paramount Conversations


(The Isotta-Fraschini turns off Brobnson and pulls up in front of the main gates.

For the moment, nothing happens; but MAX , it emerges, is engaged in important business,

staring fixedly into the rear view mirror.)



MAX

If you will pardon me, Madame, the shadow over the left eye is not quite balanced.



NORMA

Thank you, Max.



(She attends to it, using a handkerchief. Meanwhile, MAX sounds the horn impatiently.

A young STUDIO GUARD breaks off a conversation

HE's been having with an EXTRA dressed as an indian brave.)



GUARD

Hey, that's enough of that.



MAX

To see Mr. DeMille. Open the gate.



GUARD

Mr. DeMille is shooting. You need an appointment.



MAX

This is Norma Desmond. No appointment is necessary.



GUARD

Norma who?



(Meanwhile, however, NORMA has recognized JONES,

who is sifting on a wooden chair, reading a newspaper. She rolls down the window.)



NORMA

Jonesy!





(JONES looks up, frowning; then his expression clears and he approaches the car.)



JONES

Why, if it isn't Miss Desmond. How have you been, Miss Desmond?



NORMA

Fine, Jonesy. Open the gate.



(JONES turns tohis young COLLEAGUE.)



]ONES

You heard Miss Desmond.



GUARD

They don't have a pass.



(JONES shakes his head, exasperated, and begins to open the gate himself.

The car moves forward.)



JONES

Stage 18, Miss Desmond.



NORMA

Thank you, Jonesy. And teach your friend some manners.

Tell him without me there wouldn't be any Paramount Studio.



(As the car glides through the gates, JONES picks up his telephone.)



JONES

Get me Stage 18. I have a message for Mr. DeMille.



(A scene-change reveals the cavernous exterior of Sound Stage 18,

where the STAND-INS for Victor Mature and Hedy Lamaar are in position, in a blaze of light,

on the grandiose "Samson and Delilah" set. MR. DEMILLE,

recognizable from the parody version of Act I, confers with his DIRECTOR OF PHOTOGRAPHY.

HE's interrupted by one of his assistants, HEATHER, who approaches with some trepidation.)



HEATHER

Mr. DeMille?



DEMILLE

What is it?



HEATHER

Norma Desmond is here to see you, Mr. DeMille.



DEMILLE

Norma Desmond?



HEATHER

She's here at the studio.



DEMILLE

It must be about that appalling script of hers. What shall I say?



HEATHER

Maybe I could give her the brush.



DEMILLE

Thirty million fans have given her the brush. Isn't that enough? Give me a minute.



(He turns towards the set.



Meanwhile, NORMA has arrived outside the studio with MAX and JOE.

She hesitates for a moment, gripping JOE's hand fiercely.)



NORMA

Won't you come along, darling?



(JOE shakes his head.)



JOE

It's your script. It's your show. Good luck.



NORMA



Thank you, darling.



(By this time, HEATHER has emerged from the studio. She comes over to greet NORMA.)



HEATHER

Miss Desmond.



(She leads NORMA towards the studio. DE MILLE is waiting just inside; he envelops her in his arms.)



DEMILLE

Well, well, well.



NORMA

Hello, Mr. DeMille.



(A long embrace.)



NORMA

Last time I saw you was some place terribly gay. I was dancing on a table.



DEMILLE

A lot of people were. Lindbergh had lust landed.



(He starts to lead her into the studio.)



NORMA

You read the script, of course.



DEMILLE

Well, yes...



NORMA

I know how busy you are when you're shooting,

but I really think you could have picked up the phone yourself, instead of leaving it to some assistant.



DEMILLE

I don't know what you mean, Norma.



NORMA

Yes, you do.



DEMILLE

Come on in.



(HE leads her into the studio, a bewildering chaos of sound and activity, which at first stuns her.

HE shouts to be heard above the cacophony.

He hurries off. Slowly, as NORMA looks around, the sound fades to nothing.

She stands there, looking around the old familiar space. Suddenly, a VOICE rings out.)



VOICE

Miss Desmond! Hey, Miss Desmond!



(NORMA looks around, unable to identify the source of the VOICE)



HOG-EYE

Up here, Miss Desmond; it's Hog-eye!



(NORMA looks up. Up in the flies, balanced on the walkway, is a quite elderly ELECTRICIAN.)



NORMA

Hog-eye! Well, hello!



HOG-EYE

Let's get a look at you.



(And so saying, HE swivels one of the big lamps until it finds her.

SHE stands for a moment, isolated, bathed in the light.

Then, from all over the studio, murmuring among themselves, TECHNICIANS, EXTRAS

and STAGEHANDS begin to converge on her.)



NORMA

I don't know why I'm frightened,

I know my way around here

The cardboard trees,

The painted seas,

The sound here.



Yes, a world to rediscover

But I'm not in any hurry

And I need a moment.



The whispered conversations

In overcrowded hallways,

The atmosphere

As thrilling here

As always.



Feel the early morning madness

Feel the magic in the making

Why, everything's as if we never said goodbye.



I've spent so many mornings

Just trying to resist you

I'm trembling now

You can't know how

I've missed you,



Missed the fairy-tale adventures

In this ever-spinning playground,

We were young together.



I'm coming out of make-up

The lights already burning

Not long until

The cameras will

Start turning.



Feel the early morning madness

Feel the magic in the making

Yes, everything's as if we never said goodbye.



I don't want to be alone

That's all in the past

This world's waited long enough

I've come home at last.



And this time will be bigger

And brighter than we knew it

So watch me fly

We all know I

Can do it.



Could I stop my hand from shaking?

Has there ever been a moment

With so much to live for?



The whispered conversations

In overcrowded hallways,

So much to say

Not just today

But always



We?ll have early morning madness

We'll have magic in the making

Yes, everything?s as if we never said goodbye.

Yes, everything?s as if we never said goodbye.



We taught the world new ways to dream.



(The focus shifts to outside the studio, where JOE has moved off to lean against a wall,

smoke a cigarette, and enjoy the passing parade. Suddenly, HE sees BETTY hurrying past,

a bundle of scripts under her arm. HE thinks about avoiding HER altogether,

but she's seen him and bears down on him.)



BETTY

Well, hello,

Mr. Gillis.

Where have you been

Keeping yourself?



JOE

Someone's

Been doing it for me.



BETTY

And meanwhile "Blind Windows"

Is stuck on the shelf.

You said

We'd work together.



JOE

New Year's crisis

What can I say?



BETTY

Always

Full of excuses.



JOE

Promise I'll call you

Later today.



(BETTY looks at HIM for a moment.)



BETTY

You said that last time.



JOE

Betty, I won't let you down.



BETTY

I guess I'll just have to trust you.



(BETTY smiles at him and hurries on.



During this exchange, SHELDRAKE has entered. HE stops having caught sight of the Isotta.

HE tries to catch MAX?s attention, but MAX deliberately ignores him. Finally,

SHELDRAKE plants himself unavoidably in front of him.)



SHELDRAKE

You're Miss Desmond?s German shepherd.

I'm the one who's been calling.



The name is Sheldrake, A couple of weeks ago, I was looking out of my office window

and I saw you driving on to the lot. And I said that's exactly the car I've been looking for.

Great for my new Crosby picture. So, I made some inquiries and I've been calling for two weeks.

Doesn?t she ever answer the phone? It's so perfect.

You can't find that kind of quality outside of a museum.

We?re willing to pay a hundred dollars a week...



MAX

It's outrageous,

You insult her,

How can you be so cruel?

I forbid you to approach her.



SHELDRAKE

You're insane.



MAX

Go away.

Go away!



(SHELDRAKE hurries off. In the studio, DEMILLE has been attempting to set up his shot.

Now, however, unable to ignore the kerfuffle surrounding NORMA,

he steps down and approaches her; NORMA turns to him, radiant.)



NORMA

Did you see

How they all came

Crowding around?

They still love me

And soon we'll be

Breaking new ground.

Brave pioneers.



DEMILLE

Those were the days.



NORMA

Just like before.



DEMILLE

We had such fun.



NORMA

We gave the world

New ways to dream.



NORMA AND DEMILLE

We always found

New ways to dream.



(The red light goes on and the studio bell shrills.

VICTOR MATURE and HEDY LAMARR arrive

to take the place of their identically costumed STAND-INS.)



DEMILLE

Let's have a good long talk one day.



NORMA

The old team will be back in business.



DEMILLE

Sorry, my next shot's ready.



(He begins to walk her towards the studio door.



Meanwhile, outside, JOE has moved over towards MAX and notices right away,

from the LATTER's thunderous expression, that something disturbing has happened.)



MAX

Mr. Gillis...



JOE

What's the matter, Max?



MAX

I just found out the reason for all those phone calls from Paramount.

It's not Madame they want. It's her car.



JOE

Oh, my God.



(DEMILLE and NORMA have reached the doorway of the studio.)



NORMA

Now, you remember, don't you? I don't work before 10 or after 4:30 in the afternoon.



DEMILLE

It isn't entirely my decision, Norma, New York must be consulted.



NORMA

That's fine. You ask any exhibitor in the country. I'm not forgotten.



DEMILLE

Of course you're not.



(He embraces her.)



DEMILLE

Goodbye, young fellow. We'll see what we can do.



NORMA

I'm not worried. It's so wonderful to be back.



(SHE turns and sweeps regally away towards her car, the door of which MAX is holding open.

DEMILLE waves goodbye to her; then, as the Isotta drives off,

HE shakes his head, disturbed, and moves, preoccupied, back towards the studio doorway.

HEATHER is waiting for him. BETTY rushes out of the soundstage)



BETTY

Was that really Norma Desmond?



DEMILLE

It was.



HEATHER

She must be about a million years old.



DEMILLE

I hate to think where that puts me. I could be her father.



HEATHER

Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. DeMille.



(The shot is ready, and EVRYONE is waiting on DEMILLE's orders,

but HE pauses for a moment, in pensive mood, his hand on the back of his chair.)



DEMILLE

If you could have seen

Her at seventeen

When all of her dreams were new,

Beautiful and strong,

Before it all went wrong;

She's never known the meaning of

Surrender;

Never known the meaning of

Surrender.



(Slow fade to black.)
