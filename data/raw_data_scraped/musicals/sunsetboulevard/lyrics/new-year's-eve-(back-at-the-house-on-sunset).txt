New Year's Eve (Back At The House On Sunset)


NORMA

Go away.



JOE

What kind of a silly thing was that to do?



NORMA

I'll do it again! I'll do it again! I'll do it again!



JOE

Attractive headline: "Great Star kills herself for Unknown Writer".



NORMA

Great stars have great pride.

You must have some girl, why don't you go to her?



JOE

I never meant to hurt you, Norma. You've been good to me.

You're the only person in this stinking town that's ever been good to me.



NORMA

Then why don't you say thank you and go? Go, go! Go!



JOE

Happy New Year.



NORMA

Happy New Year, darling.
