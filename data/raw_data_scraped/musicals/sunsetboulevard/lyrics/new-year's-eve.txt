New Year's Eve


JOE

Max, you've pulled the stops out

It looks like Gala Night aboard S.S. Titanic

Will we play spot the actor?

As if we're visiting a gallery of waxworks?



MAX

Would you rather I mix for you a dry martini

Or shall I open the champage



JOE

Max, don't be so evasive

Who's she invited to the ball?



MAX

Madame herself made every call



NORMA

Here. Happy New Year.



JOE

Norma, I can't take this.



NORMA

Oh, shut up. Open it. Read what it says.



JOE

"Mad about the boy".



NORMA

Yes; and you do look absolutely divine.



JOE

Well, thank you.



NORMA

I had these tiles put in, you know,

because Rudy Valentino said to me, it takes tiles to tango. Come on.



JOE

No, no, not on the same floor as Valentino!



NORMA

Oh come on, come on, come on. Get up. Follow me.

And one, two... and one, two, one two, together. And one.

Don't lean back like that.



JOE

Norma, it's that thing. It tickles.
