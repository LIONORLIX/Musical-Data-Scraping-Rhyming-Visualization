There's Been A Call


NORMA

There's been a call

What did I say

They want to see me right away

Joe, Paramount, they love our child

Mr. DeMille is going wild



JOE

Well, that's wonderful, Norma.



NORMA

But it was some fool assistant

Not acceptable at all

It he wants me, then Cecil B.

Himself must call



JOE

I don't know if this is the time to stand on ceremony.



NORMA

I've been waiting twenty years now

What's a few more days, my dear?

It's happened, Joe

I told you so

The perfect year
