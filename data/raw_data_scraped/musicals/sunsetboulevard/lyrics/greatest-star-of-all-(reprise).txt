Greatest Star of All (Reprise)


NORMA

This was dawn

I don't know why I'm frightened

Silent music stars to play

Happy New Year, darling.



If you're with me, next year will be...

Next year will be...

They bring in his head on a silver tray

She kisses his mouth...

She kisses his mouth...

Mad about the boy!

They'll say Norma's back at last!



MAX

Madame, the cameras have arrived.



NORMA

Max, where am I?



MAX

This is the staircase of the palace

And they're waiting for your dance



NORMA

Of course, now I remember

I was so frightened I might fall...



MAX

You are the greatest star of all!



Lights!

Cameras!

Action!



NORMA

When he scored me I

Knew he'd have to die

Let me kiss his severed head

Compromise or death

He fought to his last breath

He never had it in him to surrender

Just like me, he never could surrender



I can't go on with the scene; I'm too happy. May I say a few words, Mr. DeMille?

I can't tell you how wonderful it is to be back in the studio making a picture.

I promise you I'll never desert you again. This is my life. It always will be.

There's nothing else. Just us and the cameras and all you wonderful

people out there in the dark. And now, Mr. DeMille, I'm ready for my close-up.



This time I'm staying

I'm staying for good

I'll be back where I was born to be

With one look, I'll be me
