Girl Meets Boy (Reprise)


JOE

How about

They don't know each other

He works the night shift

And she takes clases all day?

Here's the thing, they both share the same room

Sleep in the same bed

It works out cheaper that way



BETTY

I've a feeling you're just kidding

But to me it sounds believable

Makes a better opening than that car chase scene

Girl find boy, borrowing her toothbrush

Or oversleeping

Or at her sewing machine



JOE

You know, it's not bad, there are some real possibilities...



BETTY

Who's Norma?



JOE

Who's who?



BETTY

Sorry, I don't usually read private cigarett cases.



JOE

Norma's a friend of mine: middle-aged lady, very foolish, very generous.



BETTY

I'll say: this is solid gold. "Mad about the boy"?



JOE

So how's Artie?



BETTY

Stuck in Tennessee. It rains all the time, they're weeks behind.

No one knows when they'll be back.



JOE

Good.



BETTY

What's good about it? I'm missing him something fierce.



JOE

No, I mean this idea we had. It's really pretty good.

Back to work.



BETTY

What if he's a teacher?



JOE

Where does that get us?

Don't see what good it would do.



BETTY

No, it's great

If they do the same job



JOE

So much in common

They fall in love, wouldn't you?



BETTY

Yes, but if he's just a teacher

Then we lose those scenes in the factory



JOE

Not if he's a champion for the working man.

Girl likes boy, she respects his talent



BETTY

Working with someone can turn you into a fan



JOE

This is fun, writing with a partner



BETTY

Yes, and it could be...



JOE

A helluva movie



BETTY

Can we really do this?



BOTH

I know that we can!
