Who's Betty Schaefer?


NORMA

Is this what you're looking for, by any chance?



JOE

Why, yes.



NORMA

Whose phone number is this?

I've been worried about the line of my throat.

I think this woman has done wonders with it.



JOE

Good.



NORMA

And I've lost half a pound since Tuesday.



JOE

Very good.



NORMA

Now it's after nine. I'd better get to bed.



JOE

You had.



NORMA

Are you coming up?



JOE

I think I'll read a while longer.



NORMA

You went out last night, didn't you, Joe?



JOE

I went for a walk.



NORMA

You took the car.



JOE

I drove to the beach.



NORMA

Who's Betty Schaefer?



JOE

Surely, you don't want me to feel as if I'm a prisoner in this house?



NORMA

You don't understand, Joe. I'm under such a terrible strain.

It's been so hard I even got myself a revolver.

The only thing that stopped me from killing myself was the

thought of all those people, waiting to see me back on the screen.

How could I disappoint them? All I ask is a little patience, a little understanding.



JOE

Norma, there's nothing to worry about. I haven't done anything.



NORMA

Of course you haven't. Good night, my darling.



JOE

I should have stayed there

Poor Norma

So desperate to be ready

For what would never happen

But Betty would be waiting

We had a script to finish

One unexpected love scene

Two people, both risking

A kind of happy ending
