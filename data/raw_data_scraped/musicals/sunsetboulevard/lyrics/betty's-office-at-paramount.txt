Betty's Office At Paramount


It is night on the Paramount lot and BETTY is once again at her typewriter,

but this time there is some light on the standing New York street set,

which is being dressed for action the following day. JOE watches as BETTY finishes typing.



BETTY

T-H-E E-N-D! I can't believe it, I've finished my first script!



JOE

Stop it, you're making me feel old.



BETTY

It's exciting, though, isn't it?



JOE

How old are you, anyway?



BETTY

Twenty-two.



JOE

Smart girl.



BETTY

Shouldn't we open some champagne?



JOE

Best I can offer is a stroll to the water cooler at the end of the lot.



BETTY

Sounds good to me.



(Pause)



I love the back lot here. All cardboard, all hollow, all phoney, all done with mirrors;

I think I love it better than any street in the world. I spent my childhood here.



JOE

What were you, a child actress?



BETTY

No, but my family always expected me to become a great star.

I had ten years of dramatic lessons, diction, dancing, everything you can think of;

then the studio made a test.



JOE (Laughing)

That's the saddest story I ever heard.



BETTY

Not at all. Come on.



(Pause)



BETTY

I was born two blocks from here. My father was head electrician at the studio until he died,

and Mother still works in wardrobe.



JOE

Second generation, huh?



BETTY

Third. Grandma did stunt work for Pearl White.



(As THEY walk down the Manhattan street, the stage begins to revolve slowly,

so that THEY end up walking Downstage;

and the flimsy struts holding up the substantial sets are gradually revealed.



JOE and BETTY walk in silence for a while; BETTY's expression is deeply preoccupied.

They come to a halt in front of the water cooler.)



JOE

I guess it is kind of exciting, at that, finishing a script.



(HE fixes a couple of paper cups of water, and hands one to BETTY,

who's miles away and comes to with a start when he touches her arm.)



BETTY

What?



JOE

Are you all right?



BETTY

Sure.



JOE

Something's the matter, isn't it?



(Pause. Then BETTY blurts out.)



BETTY

I had a telegram from Artie.



JOE

Is something wrong?



BETTY



He wants me to come out to Tennessee.

He says it would only cost 2 dollars to get married in Clinch.



JOE

Well, what's stopping you! Now we've finished the script...



(He breaks off, amazed to see that SHE's crying.)



JOE

Why are you crying? You're getting married, isn't that what you wanted?



BETTY

Not any more.



JOE

Don't you love Artie?



BETTY

Of course I do. I'm just not in love with him any more, that's all.



JOE

Why not? What happened?



BETTY

You did.



(Suddenly, THEY're in each other's arms. A long kiss.)



BETTY

When I was a kid,

I played on this street,

I always loved illusion.

I thought make-believe

Was truer than life

But now it's all confusion.



Please can you tell me what's happening?

I just don't know any more.

If this is real,

How should I feel?

What should I look for?



JOE

If you were smart,

You would keep on walking

Out of my life,

As fast as you can.



I'm not the one

You should pin your hopes on,

You're falling for

The wrong kind of man.



This is crazy.

You know we should call it a day.

Sound advice, great advice,

Let's throw it away.



I can't control

All the things I'm feeling,

I haven't got a prayer.



If I'm a fool,

Well, I'm too much in love to care.

I knew where I was,

I'd given up hope,

Made friends with disillusion.



No one in my life,

But I look at you,

And now it's all confusion.



BETTY

Please can you tell me what's happening?

I just don't know any more.

If this is real,

How should I feel?

What should I look for?



I thought I had

Everything I needed.

My life was set,

My dreams were in place.

My heart could see

Way into the future.

All of that goes

When I see your face.



I should hate you,

There I was, the world in my hand.

Can one kiss kiss away

Everything I planned?



I can't control

All the things I'm feeling,

I'm floating in mid-air.

I know it's wrong,

But I'm too much in love to care.



JOE AND BETTY

I thought I had

Everything I needed.

My life was set,

My dreams were in place.

My heart could see

Way into the future.

All of that goes

When I see your face.

This is crazy.

You know we should call it a day.



JOE

Sound advice



BETTY

Great advice



JOE AND BETTY

Let's throw it away.

I can't control

All the things I'm feeling.

We're floating in mid-air.

If we are fools,

Well, we're too much in love to care.

If we are fools,

Well, we're too much in love to care!



(They fall into each other's arms and embrace passionately.

Then JOE leads BETTY by the hand back into the office.

They kiss again and it is obvious that THEY're about to make love.)
