Eternal Youth Is Worth A Little Suffering


ASTROLOGER

I don't think you should shoot before July 15th

Right now is a perilous time for Pisces

If you want 'til Venus is in Capricorn

You'll avoid a catalogue of crises



MASSEUR 1

I need three more weeks to get these thighs in shape

No more carbohydrates, don't be naughty



MASSEUR 2

We'll soon have you skipping like an ingenue

You won't look a day over forty



BEAUTICIAN 1

We have dry heat, we have steam



BEAUTICIAN 2

We have moisturizing cream



BEAUTICIAN 3

We had mud-packs, we have blood sacks



BEAUTICIAN 2

It's a rigorous regime



ALL

Not a wrinkle when you twinkle

Or a wobble when you walk



BEAUTICIAN 3

Of course, there's bound to be a little suffering



ALL

Eternal youth is worth a little suffering



ANALYST

Listen to your super ego not your id

Age is just another damn neurosis

I'll have you regressing back to infancy

And back into the womb under hypnosis



DOCTOR

I inject the tissue of the fetal lamb

The forumla's the one Somerset Maugham owns

Just modest course of thirty-sevent shots

And you will be a heaving mass of hormones



ALL

No more crow's feet, no more flab

No more love handles to grab

You'll be so thin they'll all think you're

Walking sideways like a crab

Nothing sagging, nothing bagging

Nothing dragging on the floor



Of course, there's bound to be a little suffering

Eternal youth is worth a little suffering

Of course, there's bound to be a little suffering

Eternal youth is worth a little suffering

Of course, there's bound to be a little suffering...
