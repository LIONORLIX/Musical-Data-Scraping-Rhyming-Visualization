Every Movie's A Circus


JOE

Come to get your knife back?

It's still right there, right between my shoulder blades.



BETTY

I read

One of your stories

Wasn't it Scribner's

Some magazine.

Title -

Something with windows.



JOE

It was "Blind Windows"

If that's what you mean



BETTY

That's right

I really liked it



JOE

I'm all warm and runny inside



BETTY

Let me pitch it to Sheldrake



JOE

I may be broke

But I still have my pride



BETTY

Come on.

Get off your high horse

Writers with pride don't live in L.A.

Silence

Exile and cunning

Those are the only cards you can play



JOE

Sheldrake won't buy this story

He likes trash with fairy lights

Jesus, think of the effort

Trying to get him to heighten his sights



BETTY

Every movie's a circus

Can't we discuss this

Schwab's Thursday night?



JOE

What for?

Nothing will happen

I gotta go now

Fight the good fight



BETTY

What's the rush?



JOE

See those gorillas?



BETTY

Yes, what about them?



JOE

Do me a terrific favour

Keep them amused while I escape



BETTY

If you're at Schwab's on Thursday



JOE

Done. Look, those guys are after my car.

If I lose that in this town, it's like having my legs cut off.



BETTY

Let's duck into the soundstage.



1ST FINANCEMAN

Come on, Gillis, give us the keys.



BETTY

Shhh! Please be quiet, Mr. DeMille is shooting right over there.



1ST FINANCEMAN

So what?



BETTY

He's working on "Samson and Delilah": they're doing a red-hot scene with Hedy Lamarr.

You want to stay and watch?



1ST FINANCEMAN

No.



2ND FINANCEMAN

Relax, we got five minutes.



BOTH FINANCEMEN

Hey, hey, come back here...
