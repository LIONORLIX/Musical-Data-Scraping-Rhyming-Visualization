New Ways To Dream


NORMA

This was dawn

There were no rules

We were so young

Movies were born

So many songs

Yet to be sung

So many roads

Still unexplored

We gave the world

New ways to dream

Somehow we found

New ways to dream



Joan of Arc:

Look at my face

Isn't it strong?

There in the dark

Up on the screen

Where I belong



We'll show them all

Nothing has changed

We'll give the world

New ways to dream

Everyone needs

New ways to dream



JOE

I didn't argue, why hurt her?

You don't yell at a sleepwalker

Or she could fall and break her neck

She smelled of faded roses

It made me sad to watch her

As she relived her glory

Poor Norma

So happy

Lost in her silver heaven



NORMA

Nothing has changed

We'll give the world

New ways to dream

Everyone needs

New ways to dream
