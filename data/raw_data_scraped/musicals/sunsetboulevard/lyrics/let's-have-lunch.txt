You're way behind with the payments



1ST FINANCEMAN

Don't give us any fancy footwork...



2ND FINANCEMAN

Give us the keys.



JOE

I only wish I could help

I loaned it to my accountant

He has an important client down in Palm Springs

Felt like shooting the breeze



1ST FINANCEMAN

Are you telling us you walked here?



JOE

I believe in self-denial

I'm in training for the priesthood



2ND FINANCEMAN

O.K., wise guy, three hundred bucks.



1ST FINANCEMAN

Or we're taking the car.



2ND FINANCEMAN

We have a court order.



JOE

I love it when you talk dirty.



SAMMY

That you, Sammy?



SAMMY

One learns to grin and bear 'em

This is the biggest film ever made.

Temple virgin



DAWN

Handmaiden to Delilah

You've got to find me a job

I'm way behind with my payments

I thought you were meant to be my agent

I need some work



MORINO

I only wish I could help

This town is dead at the moment

There's been this slowdown in production...



JOE

Who is this jerk?



MORINO

He's my wunderkid from Broadway

Every major studio wants him



YOUNGER MAN

Playing one against the other...



JOE

What I need is three hundred bucks



MORINO

Maybe what you need is a new agent.



JOE

Hello, Artie



ARTIE

Joe, you bastard!



JOE

You never call me any more



ARTIE

Found a cuter dancing partner

How are things?



JOE

Not so great



ARTIE

Will this help?

Twenty bucks?



JOE

Thanks, you're a pal.



ALL

Good morning, Mr. DeMille.



MYRON

Good morning, C.B.



SHELDRAKE

This is Sheldrake

Bring some water

Get me that shithead Nolan



Nolan, sweetheart

Great to talk

This draft is so much brighter

You're the best

Even so

I've hired another writer



SECRETARY

Mr. Gillis.



SHELDRAKE

Joe! What the fuck brings you here?



JOE

You wanted to see me.



SHELDRAKE

I did? What about?



JOE

"Bases Loaded." It's an outline for a baseball picture.



SHELDRAKE

So, pitch.



JOE

It's about a rookie shortstop. He's batting .347.

The kid was once mixed up in a holdup. Now he's trying to go straight.



SHELDRAKE

Wait a minute. Wait a minute. I think I have read this.

Somebody, bring in what we've got on...



JOE

"Bases Loaded."



SHELDRAKE

..."Bases Loaded."



JOE

They're pretty hot for it over at Twentieth.



SHELDRAKE

Good!



JOE

But can you see Ty Power as a shortstop?



ENSEMBLE

Let's have lunch



BETTY

Here's that "Bases Loaded" materical, Mr. Sheldrake.

I made a two-page synopsis for you, but I wouldn't bother to read it.



SHELDRAKE

Why not?



BETTY

It's just a rehash of something that wasn't very good to begin with.



SHELDRAKE

Meet Mr. Gillis. He wrote it.



ENSEMBLE

We should talk



SHELDRAKE

This is Miss Kramer.



BETTY

Schaefer. Betty Schaefer. And right now, I'd like to crawl into a hole and pull it in after me.



JOE

If I could be of any help...



BETTY

I'm sorry, Mr. Gillis, I couldn't see the point of it.



JOE

What sort of material do you suggest? James Joyce? Dostoyevsky?



BETTY

I think pictures should at least try to say a little something.



JOE

I see you're one of the message kids.

I expect you'd have turned down "Gone With the Wind".



SHELDRAKE

No, that was me.



ENSEMBLE

Gotta run



BETTY

And I guess I was disappointed.

I've read some of your other work and I thought you had some real talent.



JOE

Yeah, that was last year. This year I felt like eating.



BETTY

Well, I'm sorry, Mr. Gillis.



SHELDRAKE

Thank you, Miss Kramer.

Well, looks like Zanuck's got himself a baseball picture.



ENSEMBLE

We should talk

Gotta run

Let's have lunch



JOE

You've got to give me some work

I'll take whatever's on offer

There must be some shit that needs a rewrite

Throw it my way



SHELDRAKE

I only wish I could help

There's no spare shit at the moment

Remember the greatest writers starved in Garrets

Didn't care about pay



JOE

Are you trying to be funny?



SHELDRAKE

I believe in self-denial

Gives a man some moral backbone



JOE

Can you loan me three hundred bucks?



SHELDRAKE

I'm sorry, Gillis. Good-bye.



JOE

I just love Hollywood.
