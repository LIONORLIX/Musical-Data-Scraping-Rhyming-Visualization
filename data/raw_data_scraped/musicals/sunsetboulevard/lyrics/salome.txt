Salome


NORMA

Now go.



JOE

Next time I'll bring my autograph album.



NORMA

Just a minute, you.

Did you say you were a writer?



JOE

That's what it says on my guild card.



NORMA

And you're written pictures?



JOE

Sure have. Would you like to see my credits?



NORMA

Come over here. I want to ask you something.

Just what sort of length is a movie script these days?



JOE

Depends.



NORMA

I wrote this. It's a very important picture.



JOE

Look like six very important pictures.



NORMA

It's for DeMille to direct.



JOE

Oh, yeah? And will you be in it?



NORMA

Of course. What do you think?



JOE

Just asking. I didn't know you were planning a comeback.



NORMA

I hate that word. It's a return.



JOE

Well...fair enough.



NORMA

I want you to read it.



JOE

You shouldn't let another writer read your stuff. He may steal it.



NORMA

I'm not afraid. Sit down. Max!

Bring something to drink.



MAX

Yes, Madame.



NORMA

I said sit down!

It's about Salome.

Salome: the story of a woman. The woman who was all women.



Salome, what a woman, what a part!

Innocent body and a sinful heart

Inflaming Herod's lust

But secretly loving a holy man

No one could play her like I can



JOE

Well, I had nothing urgent coming up

I thought I might as well skim it

It's fun to see how bad bad writing can be

This promised to go to the limit



NORMA

There's so many great scenes, I can't wait

A boiling cauldron of love and hate

She toys with Herod

'Til he's putty in her hands

He reels tormented through the desert sands



JOE

It sure was a real cheery set-up

The wind wheezing through that organ

Max shuffling around and a dead ape dumped on a shelf

And her staring like a gorgon



NORMA

They drag the Baptist up from the jails

She dances the dance of the seven veils

Herod says: I'll give you anything



JOE

Now it was time for some comedy relief

The guy with the baby casket

Must have seen a thing or two, that chimp

Shame it was too late to ask it



NORMA

Have you got to the scene where asks for his head?

If she can't have him living

She'll take him dead

They bring in his head on a silver tray

She kisses his mouth. It's a great screenplay!



JOE

It got to be eleven, I was feeling ill

What the hell was I doing?

Melodrama and sweet champagne

And a garbled plot from a scrambled brain

But I had my own plot brewing



Just how old is Salome?



NORMA

Sixteen.



JOE

I see.



NORMA

Well?



JOE

It's fascinating.



NORMA

Of course it is.



JOE

Could be it's a little long

Maybe the opening's wrong

But it's extremely good for a beginner



NORMA

No, it's a perfect start

I wrote that with my heart

The river-bank, the baptist and the sinner



JOE

Shouldn't there be some dialogue?



NORMA

I can say anything I want with my eyes



JOE

It could use a few cuts



NORMA

I will not have it butchered!



JOE

I'm not talking limb from limb

I just mean a little trim

All you need is someone who can edit



NORMA

I want someone with a knack

Not just any studio hack

And don't think for a moment I'd share credit!



When were you born?



JOE

December 21st, why?



NORMA

I like Sagittarians. You can trust them.



JOE

Thanks.



NORMA

I want you to do this work.



JOE

Me? Gee, I don't know, I'm busy. I just finished one script and I'm about to start a new assignment.



NORMA

I don't care.



JOE

I'm pretty expensive. I get five hundred a week.



NORMA

Don't you worry about money. I'll make it worth your while.



JOE

Well, it's getting kind of late.



NORMA

Are you married, Mr...?



JOE

The name is Gillis. Single.



NORMA

Where do you live?



JOE

Hollywood. Alto Nido Apartments.



NORMA

You'll stay here.



JOE

I'll come back early tomorrow.



NORMA

Nonsense, there's a room over the garage. Max will take you there. Max!



MAX

Yes, Madame.



NORMA

Take Mr. Gillis to the guest room.

We'll begin a nine sharp.



JOE

Now this is more like it.



MAX

I made up the bed this afternoon.



JOE

Thanks.

How did you know I was going to stay?



MAX

There's soap and a toothbrush in the bathroom.



JOE

She's quite a character, isn't she, that Norma Desmond?
