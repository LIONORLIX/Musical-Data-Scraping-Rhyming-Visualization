Bobo's


Outside of Town Hall

There's a small piano bar

Where a neon sign

Keeps flashin', Bobo's



Jessie plays a Yamaha

Underneath the mirrored star

And that neon sign

Keeps flashin', Bobo's



Oh, Bobo's not around today

But still it's Bobo's anyway

He left that stipulation

In his will



And when you look around, it's clear

All us steadies love it here

At Bobo's

Bar and Grill



Look at Mr. Miller

Shootin' pool with Bobby

Bankin' off the corners

We love that sound



Look at Peg and Mabel

Winkin' from a table

Waitin' for a sucker

To buy a round



Look at Mr. Johnson

From the fillin' station

Pouring out his troubles

To Ruth McGore



Jacoby McGuire

Talks about the fire

He caught a drifter settin'

At the Pac N' Store



Ha ha ha, ha ha ha, woo

Tell your story honey



Bobo's

Well the swells

Down in Fair Acres

Would never care to

Venture near it,

Bobo's



So noisy that a heart could break

But a bug could never hear it

Bobo's



Ford's and Chevy's backin' up

Hey, don't smack my pickup truck

And that neon sign

Keeps flashin', Bobo's



Coffee for a dime a cup

Pecan pie, a half a buck

While that neon sign

Keeps flashin', Bobo's



So if you wanna run and hide

From what's not happening outside

The atmosphere at Bobo's fills the bill



Yeah, yeah, woo



Come on inside and have a beer

Spend the happy hour here

At Bobo's

Bar and Grill



Look at Mr. Bradley

Hockin' his insurance

Not a sole's listenin'

They never do



Sammy full of Bud now

Rythym in his what now

Sings another chorus of

Babaloo

Go Sammy, baby!



Ha ha ha ha



Bobo's

When all the pain of failin'

Gets so bad

You think you'll never shake it

Bobo's



I lost my job

My kid is sick

Jesus, God, how can I take it?

Bobo's



The laughters much too loud

To let you think of how

You'll never make it

You'll never make it

You'll never make it!



Outside of Town Hall

There's a small piano bar

Underneath the mirrored star

And that neon sign

Ah, Bobo's not around today

But still it's Bobo's anyway

He left that stipulation

In his will

Yeah



And when you look around, it's clear

All us steadies love it here

Do do do do

Do do do do

Do do do do

De do do do



Do do do do

Do do do do

Do do do do

De do do do
