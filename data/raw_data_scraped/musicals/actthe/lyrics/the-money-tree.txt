The Money Tree


The day will come

He'll come running to me

The day the sun turns black

And there's a money tree



The day will come

He'll be changing his tune

When there's a granite lake

And a cotton moon



And I listen

To all of his

Sorryful pleas

And I'll forgive him

And life will be cool as a breeze

When the rain falls up!



The day will come

He'll come back to my arms

And the slate is clean

When the snow is green



And we'll share a love

Idealic, and final, and free

Yeah the time will come

When he'll never stray

On a never gone

Of a never day

When the green dollar fits

On the silver money tree

That old money tree

Oh, yeah!



A granite lake

And a cotton moon

And he'll tremble, and stammer

And say he was wrong

And together is how we will always belong

When the earth stands still



The day will come

He'll come back to my arms

And forget the past

When a snail runs after (Sharili)*



Idealic, and final, and free

Yeah, the time will come

When he'll never stray

On the never gone

Of the never day

When we all take turns

On the silver money tree

He'll come back to me
