Hot Enough For You?


Yeah!

All right!

Oh, wow!



Take a look at the world today

You got violence and sex

You got your movies rated X

You got the devil with his hex



Flip the dial on your TV screen

And it's ten to one you'll get

A gun and bayonets

And you ain't seen nothing yet



Mister, Mister

Is it hot enough for you?

Are you diggin' the action?

How are you likin' the ride?



You're a payin' patron

So is it hot enough for you?

Since you're a customer

You're entitled to be satisfied



Yeah!

All right!

Oh, wow!



Take a look at the world today

You got pushers being plugged

You got wires bein' bugged

And you got your granny's being mugged



Flip the switch on your TV screen

You got lawyers on the take

You got your doctor's on the make

Well, for goodness sake!



Mister, Mister

Is it hot enough for you?

Are you diggin' the action?

How are you likin' the ride?

You're a payin' patron

So is it hot enough for you?



Since you're a customer

You're entitled to your homicide

You're entitled to your fratricide

You're entitled to your genocide

You're entitled to your blood and guts

That's right

You're entitled to your studs and sluts

Sure

You're entitled to you boobs and butts

Why not?
