There When I Need Him


There when I need him

There when I need him

That's all that matters

There when I'm fed up

Holding my head up

When everything shatters



Someone to lean on

Really rely on

A shoulder to cry on

No muscled Adonis

With vine leaves in his hair

But there when I need him

There



To determine what I've left

Is Juno all alone?

If the sole communication

Was by mail or telephone



Delilah might have been

No friend of Sam's

If he always had

To send her telegrams



The workable relationship

Must be with someone you can

Touch, and hold, and see

And so I found

The perfect man for me



For, he is there when I need him

There when I need him

That's all that matters

There



Someone to lean on

Really rely on

A shoulder to cry on

No muscled Adonis

With vine leaves in his hair



But, love when I need him

Love when I need him

Love when I need him

There
