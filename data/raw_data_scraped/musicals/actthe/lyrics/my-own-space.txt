My Own Space


I won't need much

Just my own space

A little time

With my own thoughts

And my own space



Some place to run

Some place to hide

Where there is no one else

But me, to meet inside



I love you more

Than I can ever say

I love you more, and more, and more

With every passing day



Allow me light

A breath of air

Leave me the only thing

I own, we cannot share



Just leave me that

Sweet love of mine

Just leave me that

Just my own space

And we'll be fine



I love you more

Than I could ever say

I love you more, and more, and more

With every passing day



Allow me light

A breath of air

Leave me the only thing

I own, we cannot share



Just my own space

Sweet love of mine

Just leave me that

Just my own space

And we'll be fine
