Babes in the Wood


[Eddie]

Little lady, don't be depressed and blue,

After all, we're both in the same canoe.

Have no fear; can't you see I'm here?

And till our journey is through,

Little lady, I will take care of you.



Give me your hand,

Here, where we stand,

We're off to slumberland,

Come, dry your eyes;

I'll sympathize

Like a father, mother, brother.

Moonlight is bright,

Kiss me goodnight,

Just like a sister should,

Then put on your little hood,

And we'll both be, oh, so good!

Like the babes in the wood.



[Elsie Darling]

When the babes were lost in the gloomy wood,

It's no wonder they were so very good.

Fourteen angels were watching them,

So all the story books state.

Sandman's coming, now it's getting late.



Give me your hand,

I understand,

We're off to slumberland,

With you I'll go

Although we've no

Angel chorus watching o'er us.



[Both]

Moonlight is bright,

Kiss me goodnight,

Just like a brother should,

Then put on your little hood,

I'll put on my little hood,

And we'll both be, oh so good!

Like the babes in the wood.
