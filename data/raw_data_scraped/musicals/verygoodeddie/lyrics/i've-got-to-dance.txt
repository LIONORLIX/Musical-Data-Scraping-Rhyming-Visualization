I've Got to Dance


[Frenchman and Chorus]

I reside, I reside in a busy street

Cabarets on every side.

I have tried, I have tried, to control my feet but I can't unless they're

tied.

When I make, when I make up my weary mind into bed it's time to creep

I awake, I awake, in the street to find, that I'm dancing in my sleep.



I gotta dance, I gotta dance when I hear music calling to me.

I just adore, I just adore to glide around the floor.

When I am all through with one dance and we sit down to have a talk

Another tune seems to softly whisper "Get up and walk."

Oh won't you stop, oh won't you stop the captivating beautiful tune

For if you don't or if you won't, I don't know what I'll do.

I'd run away from each modulation, but I'm such a slave to syncopation

That I've got to dance until the orchestra gets through.
