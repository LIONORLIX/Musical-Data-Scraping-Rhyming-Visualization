Katy Did


On summer evenings clear

When all is still:

Some gossip you may hear

From voices shrill.

Although they never all

The facts relate,

'Tis of the doings of a certain girl named Kate!



What was it that Katy did?

What's the secret Katy hid?

Some admit it;

Say she did it;

Others tell you Katy didn't!

Katy didn't, no she didn't!

They roast that poor girl all day

But somehow they never say,

What it was that little Katy did.



What did that poor girl do?

I'd like to know;

That gossips still pursue

And blame he so.

They never seem to tell

The story pat,

They just insist she did and let it go at that!



What was it that Katy did?

What's the secret Katy hid?

Some admit it;

Say she did it;

Others tell you Katy didn't

Katy didn't, no, she didn't!

They roast that poor girl all day

But somehow they never say,

What it was that little Katy did.



Oh what was it that Katy did?

What's the secret Katy hid?

Some admit it;

Say she did it!

Others tell you Katy didn't,

Katy didn't, no, she didn't!

They roast that poor girl all day

But somehow they never say,

What it was that little Katy...

Was it flirty?

Was it dirty? You'll never know

What Katy did.

I'll never tell what Katy did.
