Thirteen Collar


[Eddie]

I'm a peaceful little person,

But peace is sometimes worse'n

All the wars combined,

That histories recall,

I've been pushed around and kicked at,

Stepped upon, abused, and picked at

Till I wonder that I'm anything at all.



Even little flies that flutter

>>From the sugar to the butter

Command respect because they carry germs:

Their importance seems to teach us,

In this world of all sized creatures,

Half are robins and the other half are worms.



When you wear a 19 collar,

And a size 11 shoe

You can lead a pirate crew,

Smoke and drink and swear and chew;

But you have to lock ambition up,

And throw away the key,

When your collar's number thirteen

And your shoes are number three.



When we walk, my wife just kinda drags

Me by the hand behind her,

Like a captive minnow on a dangling hook,

And the passersby that spy me,

Stop and pitifully eye me,

With that sympathetic "Oh-that-poor-thing" look.



Every dog that I meet that's muzzled

Looks at me with such a puzzled

Air of injured pride and insolent disdain,

That I seem to gaze through leather

Straps securely sewed together

And I feel Georgina tugging at the chain.



When you wear a 19 collar and a size 11 shoe,

"Bear" and "Lion" are a few

Of the names conferred on you;

But you're classified with "Dachshunds"

Tiny "Poms" and "Pekinese,"

When your collar's number is thirteen

And you shoes are number threes.



[Georgina]

Oh! There you are, Edwin. Now, fix your tie.

Pull up your socks - and do you have the luggage checks?

Oh! No, you don't. I do.

Now, I'll just go make sure that the steward gets

All our bags on board.

Edwin, come along - don't dawdle!



[Eddie]

When you wear a 19 collar and a size 11 shoe,

There's no end or limit to all the great things you can do.

But the world is one big rat trap and your just a piece of cheese

When your collar's number thirteen and your shoes are number threes.



[Georgina]

Edwin, are you coming?
