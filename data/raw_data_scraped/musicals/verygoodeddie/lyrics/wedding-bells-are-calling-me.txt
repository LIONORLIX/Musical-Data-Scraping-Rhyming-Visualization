Wedding Bells Are Calling Me


Chorus



Every man must marry and the music he must face.

One must do and dare it, has to grin and bear it.

Doesn't matter if for years a chap has gone the pace,

He at last meets one he loves the best.

He may fancy many, seem the one and only girl.

Finds that he's mistaken, when his faith is shaken,

But it happens some fine day, just the right one comes his way.

Then he says goodbye to all the rest.



So long, dear Ophelia

And good-bye to little Delia

Day, day, Hilda, and Matilda

Fare-thee-well, my sweet Marie,

Ta-ta, pretty Polly,

I shall long for you, my Molly,

I'm missing lots of kissing,

But the toddle up the aisle

And wedding bells are calling me.



Up to now this life has been a pleasure trip to me.

Following your fancies, living love's romances.

I've coquetted mildly with the men I've chanced to see

Never cared what anybody said

Now I'll sit beside the fire

Like Alice in the play

Reading fashion papers. No more cutting capers.

When the boys come round to play I will simply laugh and say,

Don't you know I'm going to be wed?



So long, laughing Larry,

And good-bye to handsome Harry,

Day, day, Gilbert the Filbert.

Fare-thee-well, my Antony!

Ta-ta, little Teddy

I'm afraid I'll miss you Freddy

Oh, folly you were jolly

But the toddle up the aisle

And wedding bells are calling me.
