Nodding Roses


[Dick Rivers]

Elsie, is that my rose?



[Elsie Lilly]

This rose was from you?



[Rivers]

Oh, why, yes.



[Elsie]

I should have known it.



[Rivers]

Well, does it mean what I think?



[Elsie Lilly/Rivers]

Though my answer you entreat

My lips seem helpless to repeat

The words my heart would say.

Words are all such empty things

When love comes to your heart and brings

Its cloudless summer day.

How then shall I answer?

What would you propose?

Tell me in the language of the rose.



Roses nodding to and fro answer "Yes and no."

To vex, perhaps perplex the hearts of breezes

That played soft and low.

If you really love me dear

Nod and tell me so.

My lips say "yes" although my head is nodding, nodding "no."



What a little girl should say

To clear her sweetheart's doubt away

Is not so hard to guess.

Now you're talking common sense

And life for me would just commence

Were you to answer, "Yes."

But of all the methods which do you propose?

Why not take a lesson from the roase?



Roses nodding seem to say answer me today

Make haste, make haste, no time to waste

Or love will be speeding away.

Blushing red, just nod your head

Little girl, confess.

I'll answer you like roses do

By nodding, nodding, "Yes."
