Some Sort of Somebody


Have you ever really tried to concentrate?

I don't know the meaning of the word.

Then when you think you love a girl you hesitate?

Not too long, for that would be absurd!



I know that when I'm ninety, with a long gray beard,

I'll still be making up my mind.

Procrastination is a habit to be feared.

You will always find.



Some of the time

You think you love a brunette.

I know the kind who had a Spanish mother!

Some of the time you love a blond. . .

Who came from Eden

And. . .

By way of Sweden,

Sometimes they're short



Or they may be tall.

They may pass by

And sometimes they fall.

But you/I love some sort of somebody all of the time.



I have traveled all around this world of ours.

I don't doubt that you've been going some.

And I have sipped the honey from the rarest flowers.

You have sent the flowers and sipped the rum.

In every foreign country I have met my fate.

I've met her so much, I am tired.

Can you remain quite neutral and to me relate,

Which most you admire.



Some of the time

I loved a girl from Berlin.

Sie war so schon und lustig

Und so weiter.

Some of the time she came from Spain. . .

Your heart was full oh.

And. . .

Of "Throw the bull oh."

Italian Girls,

And French I adore.

Now then we know

Who started the war.

But you/I love some sort of somebody all of the time.
