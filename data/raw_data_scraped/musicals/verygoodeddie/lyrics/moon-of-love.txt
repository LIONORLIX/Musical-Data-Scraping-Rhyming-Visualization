Moon of Love


[MME. Matroppo]

When the shades of twilight fall

Where the setting sun turns the west to amber rose,

Mister Moon comes stealing out when the day is done,

He likes watching sweethearts, I suppose.



Oh, moon of love high up above,

All that you see so well, I'm sure you will not tell

What sweethearts do who trust in you.

Away up there above, oh, shining moon of love,



Oh moon of love...

High up above...

All that you see...

So...

Well...

I'm sure you will...

Not...

Tell...

What sweethearts do...

Who trust in you...

Away up there...

A-....

bove...

Oh, shining moon...

Of...

Love.



[Men]

Oh what the deuce, do you suppose we care to hear

The silly stuff you have to spill about the moon?

Of course the moon is high above for everybody saw

The guy who hung it up this afternoon.

All the old stuff,

All the old bluff,

It's a hard game,

It's a darn shame.

That is why we

Stick to the equity

For every lyric writer since the world began

Has put in overtime in raves about the moon.

And when the animals descended from the Ark

They sang a song that rhymed with June

And tune and spoon.

It's a good thing

That we can't sing

Or we'd tell

You what the

Tired chorus boy

Thinks of the

Moon.
