Finale


[Company]

I gotta dance, I gotta dance when I hear music calling to me,

I just adore, I just adore to glide around the floor.

And when I'm all through with one dance and we sit down to have a talk

Another tune seems to softly whisper "Get up and walk."

Oh won't you stop. Oh won't you stop the captivating beautiful tune

For if you don't or if you won't, I don't know what I'll do

I'd run away from each modulation, but I'm such a slave to syncopation

That I've got to dance until the orchestra gets through...



Moon light is bright

We'll say good night

Hope you enjoyed our play.

With song and jest we've done our best

For a while to make you smile.



Moon light is bright

Kiss me good night,

Just like a sweetheart should.

Then put on your little hood

And we'll both be oh so good,

Like the babes in the wood.
