If You're a Friend of Mine


Often 'tis much wiser, you'll discover,

To lose a lover and gain a friend!

You escape the woes that love may lead to.

And there's no need to pretend!

Though friendship may be all you say,

There's no denying: and love at times is apt to stray,

A tender friendship that's unending and undying

Is just a form of love, they say.



Though the last farewells must soon be spoken

No hearts are broken: we're not downcast!

Still in thought we shall be brought together,

While friendship's tether holds fast!

The time, I own, has swiftly flown since first I met you.

I never really lived before!

No need to tell you know it well - I shan't forget you,

Whate'er the future holds in store!



Come what may, 'tis sweet to know

That you're a friend of mine!

Night and day, my heart's aglow

If you're a friend of mine!

So, whate'er betide us,

Though the world may keep us apart:

Though the seas divide us,

And though fate may sever

Our lives forever, dear:

Every road runs down the hill,

If you're a friend of mine!

Every load grows lighter still,

If you're a friend of mine!

Dreams may die

As years go by:

One joy we'll never resign

Till journeys end,

If you're a friend of mine.
