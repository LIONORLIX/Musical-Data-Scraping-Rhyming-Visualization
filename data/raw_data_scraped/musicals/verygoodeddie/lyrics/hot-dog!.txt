Hot Dog!


Chorus



There's a cafe that the real swells know,

It is safe, and I long to go,

Just to shake my dogs about

Where the thoroughbred pups hang out.

There's a floor that is smooth and grand

Sumthin' more - there's a big jazz band,

When I hear the music play,

I could throw myself away.



Roo-ti-too-ti-too-ti come my little beauty,

Step a little step with me

Where the lights are gay, kid,

Till the break o' day kid,

Join me in a jam-bo-ree.

I have bottled up a lot of love, I've not uncorked as yet.

Linger just within my reach, so I can teach you how to pet.



I'll put my arms around you, baby

Hold you close, and maybe,

After we have stepp'd a few,

We shall both adorn a cozy little corner,

Big enough for just us two

Hid away from all our bunch,

We'll sip our punch and cool eggnog.

Life is full o'beauty,

Dancin' with my cutie,

Roo-ti-too-ti-toot-hot-dog...
