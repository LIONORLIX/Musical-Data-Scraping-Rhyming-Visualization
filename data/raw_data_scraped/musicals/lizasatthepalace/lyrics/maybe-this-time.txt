Maybe This Time


Maybe this time I?ll be lucky

Maybe this time he?ll stay

Maybe this time for the first time

Love won?t hurry away

He will hold me fast

I?ll be home at last

Not a loser anymore

Like the last time and the time before

Everybody loves a winner

So nobody loved me

Lady peaceful

Lady happy

That?s what I long to be

Well, all the odds are, they?re in my favor

Something?s bound to begin

It?s gotta happen

Happen sometime

Maybe this time I?ll win

Everybody, they love a winner

So nobody loved me

Lady peaceful

Lady happy

That?s what I long to be

Well, all the odds are, they?re in my favor

Something?s bound to begin

It?s gotta happen

Happen sometime

Maybe this time I?ll win
