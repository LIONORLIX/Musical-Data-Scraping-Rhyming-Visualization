New York, New York


Start spreading the news, i'm leaving today

I want to be a part of it - New York, New York

These vagabond shoes are longing to stray

And step a round of heart of it - New York, New York



I want to wake up in that city, that doesn't sleep,

To find i'm king of the hill - top of the heap



My little town blues, are melting away

I'll make a brand new start of it - in old New York

If i can make it there, i'll make it anywhere

It's up to you - New York, New York



New York, New York

I want to wake up, in that city that doesn't sleep,

To find i'm a number 1, top of the list

King of the hill, a number 1

My little town blues are melting away

I'm gonna make a brand new start of it, in old new york

And- if i can make it there, i'm gonna make it anywhere

It's up to you, New York, New York
