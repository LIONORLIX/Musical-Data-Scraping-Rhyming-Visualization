Mammy


Everything seems lovely

When you start to roam

But here's what you'll be sayin'

When you are far from home



Mammy, mammy

The sun shines east, the sun shines west

I know where the sun shines best

Oh, my mammy, my mammy



My heart strings a tangle around, Alabama-ammy



I'm comin', sorry that I made you wait

I'm ma ma comin', I hope and pray I'm not too late



Oh my, mammy, my little mammy

I'd walk a million miles, for one of those smiles from mammy



Mammy, yeah, mammy

Woah, woah, the sun shines east, the sun shines west

But I know where the sun shines best

Oh mammy, my little mammy



I'd walk a million miles for one of those smiles

From my mammy
