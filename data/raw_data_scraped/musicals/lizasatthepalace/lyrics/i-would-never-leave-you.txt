I Would Never Leave You


People that I pass often ask me, "How you been?"

"How about this weather?" "Oh my God, you're looking thin!"

Though I am flattered

By complimentary chatter,

We hardly get much farther than "Hello."



I'll always tell you

The things that really matter,

The only thing you really need to know.



So,

Why do you ask,

Where have I been

So long?



I've been right here,

Living my life

In song.



I've been around,

I've been lost, I've been found,

But I've never really been gone.

I've had romances,

Put my heart out, took my chances -

I learned when it's time to move on.



Oh, but I never left,

Though I've been left alone.

With every breath,

I'm stronger on my own.

The smoke has cleared,

And look who's here:

The same dame you've always known.



Oh, I never left,

And I would never leave you alone.

...But I've never really been gone.



(orchestra break)



....I learned when it's time to move on.



Oh, but if I have learned

One thing in life that's true.

You're there for me,

And I am here for you.



The smoke has cleared,

And look who's here:

The same damn dame you've always known.



Oh, I never left,

And I would never leave you.

Where would I go?

Don't you know how much I need you?



I never left,

And I would never leave you alone.
