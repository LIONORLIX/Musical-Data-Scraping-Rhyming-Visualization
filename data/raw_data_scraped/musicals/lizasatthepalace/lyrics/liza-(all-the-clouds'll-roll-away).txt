Liza (All The Clouds'll Roll Away)


It's Liza with a Z

Not Lisa with an S

'Cause Lisa with an S

Goes "sss" not "zzz"

It's Z instead of S

Ly instead of Lee

It's simple as can be

See, Liza!

I'll do it again...



It's Liza with a Z

Not Lisa with an S

'Cause Lisa with an S

Goes "sss" not "zzz"

It's Z instead of S

Ly instead of Lee

It's simple as can be

See, Liza!



Now - if my name were Ada,

I'd be Ada,

Even backwards I'd be Ada

Or if my name were Ruth,

Then I'd be Ruth,

Because with Ruth,

What can you do?

Or Sally, or Margaret, or Ginger or Faye

But when you're a Liza

You always have to say...



It's Liza with a Z

Not Lisa with an S

'Cause Lisa with an S

Goes "sss" not "zzz"

It's Z instead of S

Ly instead of Lee

It's simple as can be

See, Liza!



Oh! And that is only half of it

There's another way

Fate treats me cruelly.

How often I remember someone saying

"There she goes, Lisa Minooli!"

Or Minoli, or Miniola, or Minili, or Minelie

So is it a wonder, I very often cry?



It's M-I-Double N,

then-E-Double L-I,

You double up the N, thats nn, not ll

Then E, double the L, end it with an I,

That's the way you say Minnelli...

Liza Minnelli,

It's Italian,

Blame it on papa,

What can I do?



Every Sandra

Who's a Sahndra,

Every Mary who's really Marie

Every Joan

Who is a Joanne

Has got to agree with me

When I've announced

I don't mind being pommelled

Or trampled or trounced

But it does drive you bats

To be miss, Miss pronounced...



It's Liza with a Z

Not Lisa with an S

'Cause Lisa with an S

Goes "sss" not "zzz"

It's Z instead of S

Ly instead of Lee

It's simple as can be

See, Liza!



Then M-I-Double N,

then-E-Double L-I,

You double up the N, thats "nn," not "ll,"

Then E, double the L, end it with an I,

That's the way you say... Minnelli...

Liza Minnelli!

It's easy!

It's easy! See, it's Leezy!

No! Liza...!
