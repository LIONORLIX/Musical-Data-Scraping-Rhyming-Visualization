My Own Best Friend


One thing I know

And I've always known

I am my own best friend

Baby's alive

But baby's alone

And baby's her own best friend



Many's the kind

Who told me he cares

But they were scratchin' my back

'Cause I was scratchin' theirs...



And trusting too

That's only for fools

I play the game

When I make the rules

And rule number one

From here to the end

Is I am my own best friend



I am my own best friend



Baby's her own best friend

Three muskateers

Who never said die

Are standing here this minute

Me, myself, and I...



Life is a school

I'll pass every test

If life is a game

I'll play it the best

'Cause I won't give in

And I'll never bend

And I am my own - best - frie-iend...
