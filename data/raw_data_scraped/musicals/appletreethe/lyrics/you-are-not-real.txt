You Are Not Real


Flip



The newspapers call you

The goddess of sex

If you are a goddess

I'm oedipus rex

Neither goddess nor woman

You're something apart

With a silicone body

And a digital heart.

Instead of a soul

You got a sign, sayin'

Decor by helena rubinstein



All



How does it feel

To be the world's ideal

When you know an' i know

That you are not real-real-real

You are not real.



Flip



The sons of old adam

Have reasons to grieve

Since we took a look at

You daughters of eve

You don't know what's honest

You don't know what's true

I'll tell you what's real

It's the least i can do.

Dirty fingernails is real

An' strag-ga-ly hair

An' slovenly clothes

An' a air of despair



All



How does it feel

To be the world's ideal

When you know an' i know

That you are not real-real-real

You are not real



Flip



I'm weary of glamour

An' women like you

I long for a woman

Who's real through and through

No goddess will ever

Get my heart to throb

For the girl of my dreams

Is a slob.



All



How does it feel

To be the world's ideal

When you know an' i know

That you are not real

How does it feel

To be the world's ideal

When you know an' i know

That you are not--

You are not--

You are not--

Real!!!
