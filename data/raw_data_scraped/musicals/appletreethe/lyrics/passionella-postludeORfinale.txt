Passionella Postlude/Finale


Flip:

Here we are.



Passionella:

The star



Flip:

And the star.



Passionella:

Well it just goes to show



Flip:

We were some pair -

Me with my crazy hair.



Passionella:

Me with my solid gold gown.



Female Chorus (Male Chorus):

Movie star, every inch a movie star.

(Like a shining light of truth she stands)



All:

This truly remarkable,

Sensitive, luminous

Movie star!



[Thanks to Rick Jefferson for lyrics]
