The Apple Tree (Forbidden Fruit)


Listen closely. Let me fill you in

About the rich ripe round red

Rosy apples the call forbidden fruit

What i'm about to say is

Confidential so promise you'll be mute.

Because if every creature in the garden knows

They'll come 'round like hungry buffalos

And in no time there'll be none of those

Precious apples left for you and me.



Now in the average apple

You're accustomed to skin, seeds, flesh and core

But you will find that these are

Special apples that give you something more

Why, every seed contains some information you

Need to speed your education, the

Seeds, indeed, of all creation are here

Why, be foolish my dear

Come with me

To that tree.



With every sweet and juicy

Luscious bite of this not forbidden fruit

You'll see your mind expand and

Your perceptions grow more and more acute



And you can teach him plumbing and philosophy

New techniques for glazing pottery

Wood-craft, first-aid, home economy

Madam, adam will be overjoyed!



When he becomes aware of

Your attainments he'll beam with loving pride

And he will say,



"o, eve, you're

Indispensable! Please, don't leave my side!"

And with your nifty,new-found education, he'll

Relish every conversation,why

You'll be adam's inspiration this way!

Just an apple a day

Wait and see

Come with me

To that tree!

Now!
