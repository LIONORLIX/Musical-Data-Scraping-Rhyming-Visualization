Oh, To Be A Movie Star


Chimneys are cozy,Chimneys are warm.

I think of chimneys as ports in a storm.

What warm and cozy, or not.

I would give up alot.

If I could only be a movie star.



A movie star.

Ooh to be a movie star.

A beautiful, glamorous, movie star.



No one imagines, I harbor this hope.

People who know me,

Keep sending me soap.

Lacy soot stains and tar,

They'd see how wrong they are.

If I could only be a movie star.



A movie star.

Ooh to be a movie star.

A beautiful, glamorous, radient, ravishing, movie star.



I'd be so grateful, that after premiers.

I'd sweep out the theatre and fold up the chairs.

I would know what it meant, to be truly content.

If I could only be a movie star.



Prospects look dismal, how can I go on?

My piggy is empty, my Kleenex is gone.

If I starve here alone,

Let them carve on my stone.

She never got to be a movie star.



I'm not asking much.

It's not as if I wanna be a rich, glamorous, beautiful, movie star.

Or even a well liked beautiful, glamorous movie star.

I just wanna be a beautiful, glamorous movie star.

Gloria Jones same.

A beautiful, glamorous, radient, ravishing, (achoo) movie star.
