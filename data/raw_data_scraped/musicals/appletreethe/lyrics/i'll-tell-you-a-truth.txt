I'll Tell You A Truth


Narrator:

I'll tell you a truth

That's hard to swallow.

I'll tell you a truth.

Oh, listen well.

If you are in love

With a lover who's jealous

Then sooner or later,

You're headed for Hell.



So say goodbye,

And don't you wait

Because tomorrow

May be too late.

Yes, listen well

To what I say.

Tell jealous lovers

To go away.



I'll tell you a tale

For you to ponder.

I'll tell you a tale,

Oh, listen well.

A curious tale

It tells of a princess,

And it tells of her lover

And all that befell.
