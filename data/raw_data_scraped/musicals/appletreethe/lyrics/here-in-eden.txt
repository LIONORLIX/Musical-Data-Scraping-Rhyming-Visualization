Here In Eden


So many creatures

So many things

Each wonderous object is beautiful and striking

And i see nothing that isn't to my liking

Here in eden.



There's plums and peaches

And pears and grapes

So ripe and juicy and utterly inviting.

I find the apples especially exciting

Here in eden.



As for me

I can see

I was meant to rejoice

In the round

Vibrant sound

Of my own voice.



It's all so perfect

And so ideal

And yet i do have one tiny reservation

There's nothing handy for making conversation

Here in eden.



How'd i come?

Where'm i from?

What's my ultimate aim?

I don't even know

Even so

I'm glad i came.



It's all so lovely

I may just weep

I love this garden and ev'rything that's in it

And something tells me to treasure ev'ry minute

Blossom and bud

Mountain and mud

I know i'll be happy

Perfectly happy

Here in eden.
