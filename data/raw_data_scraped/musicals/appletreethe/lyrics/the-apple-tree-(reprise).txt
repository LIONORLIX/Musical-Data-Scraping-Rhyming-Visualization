The Apple Tree (Reprise)


I must advise your proudness,

There are things it is better not to know.

If you insist your proudness,

Then of course I will tell you even so.



You will not reconsider,

You are certain you want this knowledge.

Though I warn you against this knowledge,

Be it on your own head!



What's forbidden to know.

You shall know.

Be it so!
