Make Way (Reprise)/Which Door?


Make way.

Her regal proudness

Her flashy highness.

Her self indulgeness.

Her godesssness.

His mountainship.



Make way.

She comes.

Princess Bar-bara.



Prisioner choose.

It's your chance to prove your innocence or guilt!



Which door should I choose?

Left, right, left right.

Show me.

Guide me.

Bar-bara, Bar-bara, I know you are my only hope.



Which door should I choose?

Left, right, left right.

Torment.

Torture.

The lady, the tiger.

Sanjar, Sanjar, this choice is tearming me apart.



Which door will he choose?

Left, right, left right.

Dead man, wed man.

The lady, the tiger.

Left, right, left right.

Dead man, wed man.

The lady, the tiger.

This door, that door.

Which door will he choose?



Yeah, yeah, Hanna.

Yeh, yeh, Halu.

Yeah, yeah, Manna.

Halu, yeah, yea!



Before we go on,

Let's look at the problem.

Lady or tiger,

Which will come out?



The deeper we probe,

The heart of Bar-bera.

The more we discover,

The outcome's in doubt.



If you have love,

you understand.

How love and hate,

can walk hand in hand.



So place yourself,

In Bar-bera's shoes.

The lady or the tiger.

Which did she choose?
