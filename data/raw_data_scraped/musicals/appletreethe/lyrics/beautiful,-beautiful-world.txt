Beautiful, Beautiful World


I see animals and birds and flowers,

Ev 'ry color, ev'ry shape and size;

Moss and pebbles and a host of wonders,

Gleaming ev 'ry where I aim my eyes.

Soif ever I'm attacked by boredom,

I'll just open up my eyes and see

This diversified, curious, fascinating, bountiful,

Beautiful, beautiful world.



I hear chattering and I hear chirping,

Whistling, murmuring and horks and snorts;

When I simply take the time to listen.

I hear music of a thousand sorts.

So if ever Iwould rest my eyes,

My ears can easily describe to me

This diversified, curious, fascinating bountiful,

Beautiful, beautiful world.



Stlll it's possible a day may come,

When momentarily the world wears thin;

IfI weary of the world outside me,

I can always take a good look in.

For along with ev'ry cloud and cobweb.

I'm emphatic'ly a member of

This diversified, curious, fascinating bountiful,

Beautiful world, I love you.



World, thank you very much for all I see, hear, taste and touch;

Plus ev'ry whiff I sniff. *(Snift)*
