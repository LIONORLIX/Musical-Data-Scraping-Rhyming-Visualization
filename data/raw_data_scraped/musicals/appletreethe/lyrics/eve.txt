Eve


She keeps filling up the hut with rubbish

Like flowers

And plants

And not only is it overcrowded

It's loaded

With ants

She is definitely too intrusive

A nuisance

And yet.....

She's an interesting creature--

This eve.



She's developing a strange new habit

Which doesn't

Make sense

She's forever reaching out to touch me

Which makes me

Feel tense

She is definitely quite eccentric

A numbskull

And yet.....

She's an interesting creature--

This eve.



Colors drive her absolutely crazy

The gold of the sun

The purple of the hills

Crimson colored clouds in the skies

When i say this is sentimental hogwash

Foolishness

She simply sighs.



When i'd rather be alone and resting

Then she comes

Around

And invariably starts describing

Some wonder

She's found

She invariably get my back up

Yet invariably i perceive

She's an interesting creature--

This eve.



Once i saw her standing on a hilltop

Her head tilted back

The sunlight on her face

Gazing at the flight of a bird

And suddenly i saw that she was--

Beautiful--

Beautiful, yes that's the word.



There are animals around this garden

More soothing than she

But there's nothing in the whole of eden

More pleasant

To see

If she'd only learn to keep her mouth shut

One minute at a time

Why, i believe

I could possibly enjoy

Just watching

This curiously interesting creature--

Called eve.
