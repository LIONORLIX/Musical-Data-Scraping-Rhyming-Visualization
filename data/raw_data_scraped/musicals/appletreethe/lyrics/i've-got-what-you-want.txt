I've Got What You Want


I've got what you want

I've got what you need

I know how much you want it

Yeh! Yeh! Sanjar!

I know my father would kill me

If he knew

My heart was set, on giving

What i've got to you. Yeh ! Yeh !



I know what i know

You need what i know

What's mine is yours

You know it. Yeh! Yeh! Sanjar!

You just might die

So i will give it to you

And when i give it to you

You'll shout for joy

And so will i !!



Yes, i will give it to you

And when i give it to you

You'll shout for joy

And so will i !!
