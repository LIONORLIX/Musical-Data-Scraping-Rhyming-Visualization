I Know


Look at me I'm a movie star.

Every inch a movie star.

A beautiful, galmorous ...



Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

Passionella how I love you ...

I know.

If you knew how I adore you ...

I know.

I can't sleep at night for thinking about you ...

It's understandable.

I want you, I want you, I want you ...

It must be awful.



Did you know I stole your slippers?

I knew.

Pictures of you fill my bedroom ...

Mine too.

I don't love Sofia,

I don't love Bardot.

I love Passionella ...

I know.



Passionella you're my idol ...

Of course.



How I long to look like you do ...

You should.

I've read every word they've written about you ...

You're not the only one.

In private you are me and I am you.

That's what I'm here for.



As a goddess you're immortal, oh ...

Let me touch your sacred body, oh ...

We'll be right here waiting everywhere you go.

You cannot escape us!

Passionella!!!
