Storybook


Listen to me, I have beautiful dreams I can spin you

Dreams to linger within you

Close your eyes and we'll ride my carousel

I'll sing you stories of lovers whose love used to fill me

And the lovers who will be

For, you see, love is one thing I do well

Come, let's believe love can be just as sweet as it seems

Let's live on dreams!



In my dreams such beautiful lovers have found me

Storybook lovers surround me

Nothing is real, but I'm flying, sighing

Where, where, where is my storybook ending?

Why does my golden pretending

Leave me with nothing to hold but my dreams?



Oh, is it only in dreams that we find our ideal love?

Are there lovers with real love?

If you know how to feel love, show me now

Ah, but my prince, if you can't be as sweet as you seem

I'd rather dream



Come and wake me!

Come be the love I can hold now

Storybook love leaves me cold now

Show me the way to stop dreaming

There is only one perfect storybook ending

That is the end of pretending

That is the moment I say, love me now!



Et sur mon manege, l'amour toujours est chantant

De mes reves, c'est le commencement

Et j'espere une fin heureuse

Mais la fin de l'histoire ne vient pas tres doucement

Pour l'histoire, il faut faire semblant

Certes je n'embrasse que mes reves

Seuls mes reves!
