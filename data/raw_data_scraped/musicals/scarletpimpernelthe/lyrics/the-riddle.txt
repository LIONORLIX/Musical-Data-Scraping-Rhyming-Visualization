The Riddle


See the moon slink down in the sky, darling

Let your fantasies fly, darling

Life is cold, and the game is old

Just see how virtue repays you

You turn and someone betrays you

Betray him first

And the game's reversed!

For we all are caught in the middle

Of one long treacherous riddle

Can I trust you? Should you trust me too?

We shamble on through this hell

Taking on more secrets to sell

Till there comes a day when we sell our souls away!

Through the mist your lover is beckoning

Comes that moment of reckoning

Faces change, even smiles grow strange

And we all have so many faces

The real self often erases

Enticing lies flicker through our eyes

Feel the terror draw ever nearer

The more you stare in the mirror

But hold your own

Face the wind alone

Reel on, love! Toughen your scars

Year by year we're falling like stars

Till there comes a day when we well our souls away!

Can I run to you? Are you true to me?

I'll do unto you as you do to me!

And we slowly learn someone has to burn

Better you than me!

Oh, every Judas once loved a Jesus

But finally treason will seize us

And only fools follow golden rules

We all are caught in the middle

Of one long treacherous riddle

Of who trusts who, maybe I'll trust you

But can you trust me?

Wait and see!
