Where's The Girl


I remember days full of restlessness and fury

I remember nights that were drunk on dreams

I remember someone who hungered for the glory

I remember her, but it seems she's gone

Where's the girl? Where's the girl with the blaze in her eyes?

Where's the girl with that gaze of surprise?

Now and then I still dream she's beside me

Where's the girl who could turn on the edge of a knife?

Where's the girl who was burning for life?

I can still feel her breathing beside me

And I know she remembers how fearless it feels

To take off with the wind at her heels

She and I took this world like a storm

Come again!

Let the girl in your heart tumble free

Bring your renegade heart home to me

In the dark of the morning, I'll warm you

I'll rouse you

Marguerite, don't forget I know who you are

We were cut from the same surly star

Like two jewels in the sky sharing fire

Where's the girl so alive and still aching for more?

We had dreams that were worth dying for

We were caught in the eye of a storm

Come again!

Let the girl in your heart tumble free

Bring your renegade heart home to me

In the dark of the morning, I'll warm you

I'll rouse you

Where's the girl?

Is she gazing at me with surprise?

Do I still see that blaze in her eyes?

Am I dreaming, or is she beside me now?
