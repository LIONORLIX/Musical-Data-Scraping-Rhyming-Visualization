The Creation Of Man


Peacocks!

Sink me!

Think ye, sir,

How those feathered boys love to flaunt their tails!

Stallions!

Zounds, sir!

Hounds sir! Stags!

Of the goosie and the gander, sir

Which gender is the grander, sir

To render total candor, sir, the spendour is the male's!

Be an example to your sex

Give your boot a dapper strap

And it's smarter if your garter has some snap!

Cravats should be flounced about our necks

Wear a nightcap when you nap

Be bewitching with some stitching on your cap!

Now, drape your cape

And puff your cuff

Embroider those lapels!

Be the kind of the beasts in pastels!

La, but someone has to strike a pose

And bear the weight of well-tailored clothes

And that is why the Lord created men

Strut, sir!

What, sir?

Roosters do!

Give a cock his comb and the hens will pale!

Bucks! Bulls!

More, sir!

Boars, sir! Rams!

Of the nanny goat and billy, sir

Whose beard is fully wooly, sir?

It's bully for the billy for he's willy-nilly male!

Sir, be a lion-hearted prig

Fill those pantaloons with light!

I could dangle down a spangle out of sight!

Oh, yes! Be bold, sir!

When it's cold, slap on that wig

Draw your britches in quite tight

Even more so, and your torso will ignite

Now, smock your frock

Perfume your plume

I'll let my waistcoat swing!

And the jungle will bow to its king!

La, but someone has to strike a pose

And bear the weight of well-tailored clothes

And that is why the Lord created men

Yes, that is why the Lord created men

Remember what we're here for

Why we must be dressed to kill

If we have to look like Cleopatra

Then we will!

If you're out to make a splash, cheri,

Do know your haberdashery!

Buttons, buckles, ruffles and lace

Represent the human race!

La, but someone has to strike a pose

And bear the weight of well-tailored clothes

Each species needs a sex that's fated

To be highly decorated

That is why the Lord created men
