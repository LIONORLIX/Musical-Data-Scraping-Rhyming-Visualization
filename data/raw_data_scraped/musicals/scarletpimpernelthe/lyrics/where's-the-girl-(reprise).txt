Where's The Girl (reprise)


I remember days full of restlessness and fury

I remember nights that were drunk on dreams

I remember someone who hungered for the glory

I remember her

Let her go, let her live, let her die on her own

We are all of us bruised and alone

Now we both will have nothing to hold

Let her know, hurl it in to her renegade heart

That the best of our dreams fell apart

And the dark of the morning grows cold
