Vivez


Vivez!

Mes amis, je suis enchantee

Simply to move through the sunlight

Open your arms to this warm, bright

Moment embracing us

Vivez!

You have one life, let it be gay

Shouldn't one do as one's told to?

No, let the moment enfold you

Grab up your one golden chance

Darlings, life is such romance

Give this world a sweeping glance

Let it set your soul a-dancing night and day

Vivez!

Live, here's to life, let us be gay

Let go of each inhibition

No one need give you permission

What are you waiting for?

Vivez! Live!

No one lets loose every which way

Life is too short to be guarded

I think I'm quite open-hearted

Loosen that heart if you dare

Come and lay your passions bare

But, my dear, if people stare...

Then it's time to let your hair come tumbling down

What of propriety?

There are rules we obey in society

You prefer to live calmly and quietly

But your heart wants to play

These tender hearts of ours

May be endlessly naive

But we grow strong if we believe

This fragile world of ours

Spins us off into the storm

Hold on to me and I'll be warm

Winnifred, what to do?

Well, Davina, we simply must muddle through

If there's no one to shudder and sputter to

Then we might as well live

Oh, vivez!

You have one life, let it be gay

Don't put it off till you're dying

Now is the time to be flying

Grab up your one golden chance

Darlings, life is such romance

Life is tossing you a new bouquet

Meet your heart half-way

And your heart will say vivez!
