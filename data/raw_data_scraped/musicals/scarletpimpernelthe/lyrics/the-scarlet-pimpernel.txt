The Scarlet Pimpernel


Lud love me! Such conjecturing could drive a man insane

And I'm the one to set this gossip quite to rest

The Pimpernel is me

Indeed! And I'm the Queen of Spain!

The Pimpernel is nothing but a nosy pest

No, the vicar says the Pimpernel's a bishop in disguise

Who gives absolution night and day

Stuff and nonsense, don't you know

He's a maharajah from Bombay?

They say he has enormous feet

And that he tends to overeat

I've heard he's fussy with his food

And eats his breakfast in the nude

Is he robust? Or very pale?

At least we know he's male!

Who is the Scarlet Pimpernel?

Me sister says his breath is sweeter than an Irish rose

I'm sure I'd fall in love if he would cross my path

La, yes, if you could overlook the warts upon his nose

And possibly persuade him he should take a bath

Rumour has it he's Castillian

He's a reckless buccaneer

And I hear he carries several whips

He's a sultan from Kabul

with women at his fingertips

They say he's nearly eight feet tall

And yet quite graceful...all in all

I'm told he waddles when he walks

And often twitches when he talks

Is he a dolt? He's very deep!

Oh, England's losing sleep!

Who is the Scarlet Pimpernel?

The butcher in the village claims he saw the man last week

Galloping his camel cross the moor

He's been seen

Wearing full Blakeney green

I've told you all before

The fellow's me

It's George the Third

Perhaps a convict run amok

This Pimpernel could be most any sod

Bite your tongue, he is dashing and young

The Pimpernel's a god

And he'll find me, and he'll wake me, and he'll take me

Down on a haystack

He'll face me

Then at last you could tell

If he's a hero or a monk, a fiddling Nero or a drunk

Who is the Scarlet Pimpernel?

I'm sure he's flatulant and crass

Here, here, the man's a horse's ass

No, no, he's neighbourly and kind

But quite erotically inclined

Whatever guise he may employ,

He's England's pride and joy

This plucky non-pareil

This lucky, bloody swell

Who is the Scarlet Pimpernel?
