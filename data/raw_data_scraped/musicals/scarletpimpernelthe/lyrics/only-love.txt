Only Love


I see you try to turn away

I hear the words you want to say

I feel how much you need to hide

What's happening inside you tonight

Come meet my eyes one moment more

Our eyes are different than before

This night, so beautiful and strange

This night begins to change who we are

Don't turn away, it's only love

Quietly coming to you, whispering through you

Take my hand, it's only love

Let it come through you slowly

Don't be afraid, it's only love

We touch, the dark begins to stir

We can't go back to where we were

Don't be afraid to make it real

Don't be afraid to feel tonight

Don't turn away, it's only love

Only a touch that frees you

Let it release you

Take the chance, it's only love

Open your heart and show me

Don't be afraid, it's only love

Don't close your eyes

Don't hold it in

Reach out to me, let it all begin

Don't be afraid, it's only love

Only a touch that frees you

Let it release you

Take the chance, it's only love

Let it come through you slowly

Open your heart and show me

Don't be afraid, it's only love
