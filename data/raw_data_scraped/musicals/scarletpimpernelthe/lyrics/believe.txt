Believe


Like stepping on the air so blindly

I trust you will be there to find me

Like reaching through the blue

I place my faith in you

I do believe

These tender hearts of ours

May be endlessly naive

But we grow strong if we believe

This fragile world of ours

Spins us off into the storm

Hold on to me and I'll be warm

As roses bend through breeze, unbend me

As the rose bends to the sun

And in the darkness, please defend me

Two in love become as one

As waves lean on the sea, my love come lean on me

I do believe in you
