Prayer


No, stay

I don't care what you've said or done

Don't go away

Not now, when life had just begun

Come back, and be the woman who I knew

Help me to believe in you

What on earth am I to do?

She's gone, this vision who was not quite real

I must move on despite the pain

The pain will heal

Oh, Lord, how could you let me love like this?

No one dies upon a kiss

And only fools believe in bliss

And yes, God knows I am a fool

A man deluded by his wife

A figure ripe for ridicule

Who's lived a vain and useless life

So be it then, I'll play that game

I do not give a tinker's damn

I'll be a fool, it's all the same

It truly doesn't matter what I am

God, no!

I'm broken, but I'm still alive

And slowly I will feel my soul revive

With time, I'll find a way to right this wrong

If it takes my whole life long

Lord, I'll fight my battles all alone

But make me strong
