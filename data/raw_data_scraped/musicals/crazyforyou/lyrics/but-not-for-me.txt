But Not for Me


[Polly]



They're writing songs of love,

But not for me:

A lucky star's above,

But not for me.

With love to lead the way,

I've found more skies of gray

Than any Russian play

Could guarantee.

I was a fool to fail!

And get that way,

Heigh ho!  Alas!

And also lackaday!

Although I can't dismiss

The mem'ry of his kiss...



It started of so swell,

This "let's pretend."

It all began so well,

But what an end!

The climax of a plot,

Should be the marriage knot,

But there's no knot for me.
