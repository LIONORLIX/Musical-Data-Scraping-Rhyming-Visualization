Someone to Watch over Me


[Polly]

There's a saying old

Says that love is blind -

Still we're often told,

"Seek and ye shalI find."

So I'm going to seek

A certain lad I've had in mind.

Looking everywhere,

Haven't found him yet;

He's the big affair

I cannot forget.

Only man I ever

Think of with regret.

I'd like to add his initials to my monogram.

Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost

lamb.

There's a somebody I'm longing to see

I hope that he

Turns out to be

Someone who'll watch over me.

I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood.

I know I could

Always be good

To one who'll watch over me.

Although he may not be the man some

Girls think of as handsome

To my heart he carries the key.

Won't you telI him please to put on some

speed -

Follow my lead -

Oh!  How I need

Someone to watch over me.

Someone to watch over me.
