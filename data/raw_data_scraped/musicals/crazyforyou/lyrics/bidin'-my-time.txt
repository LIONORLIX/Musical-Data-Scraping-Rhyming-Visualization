Bidin' My Time


[Mingo, Moose and Sam]

I'm bidin' my time,

'Cause that's the kinda guy I'm.

While other folks grow dizzy

I keep busy

Bidin' my time

Next year, next year,

I'll just keep on nappin' -

This year, this year,

I'll just keep on nappin'

And bidin' my time,

'Cause that's the kinda guy I'm.

There's no regrettin'

When I'm settin'

Bidin' my time.
