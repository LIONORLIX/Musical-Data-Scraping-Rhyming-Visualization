New York Interlude/Nice Work If You Can Get it


[The Girls]

The man who only live for making money

Lives a life that isn't necessarily sunny;

Likewise the man who works for fame --

There's no guarantee that time won't erase his name

The fact is

The only work that really brings enjoyment

Is the kind that is for girl and boy meant.

Fall in love -- you won't regret it.

That's the best work of all -- if you can get it.

Holding hands at midnight

'Neath a starry sky...



[Bobby]

Oh that is nice work if you can get it.



[The Girls]

And you can get it -- if you try.

Strolling with the one girl

Sighing sigh after sigh...



[Bobby]

Oh nice work if you can get it.



[The Girls]

And you can get it -- if you try.

Just imagine someone

Waiting at the cottage door.



[Elaine, Louise and Susie]

Waiting at the cottage door



[The Girls]

Where two hearts become one...



[The Girls and Bobby]

Who could ask for anything more?



[The Girls]

Loving one who loves you,

And then taking that vow...



[The Girls and Bobby]

Nice work if you can get it,



[The Girls]

And if you get it --



[Bobby]

Won't you tell me how?



[The Girls]

And you can get it -- if you try.

And you can get it -- if you try.

And you can get it -- if you try.

And you can get it -- if you try.



[Bobby]

Holding hands at midnight

'Neath a starry sky...

Nice work if you can get it

And you can get it -- if you try.

Strolling with the one girl

Sighing sigh after sigh...

Nice work if you can get it

And you can get it -- if you try

Who could ask for anything more?
