Naughty Baby


[Irene]

If you want a girl who's sentimental,

One who'll never set you in a whirl,

One who will be always sweet and gentle,

I am not that kind of girl.

But if you prefer a rather swift one,

If you think you'd like to run around

With a bright one

I am just the right one.

Naughty baby,

Naughty baby,

Who will tease you.

I can show the way

And know the way

To please you.

If you're wanting a beginner

I shan't do

I can make a saint a sinner

When I want to.

If you find

The simple kind

Are rather slow, dear,

Then you ought to try

A naughty one

You know, dear,

But you'll never meet another who will be

A naughty baby, naughty baby just like me.



[Harry, Wyatt, Junior and Mingo]

Naughty baby we love you.

Though you may be bad it's true

Please don't go.

For though we've been warned about you

You must know

That we want you so!



[Irene]

If you find

The simple kind

Are rather slow, dear,

Then you ought to try

A naught one

You know, dear,

But you'll never meet another who will be

A naught baby, naughty baby...



[Lank]

Naughty baby, naughty baby...



[Irene]

Naughty baby, naughty baby...



[Harry, Wyatt Junior and Mingo]

Naughty baby...



[Irene]

Just like me.
