Could You Use Me?


[Bobby]

Have some pity on an Easterner;

Show a little sympathy.

No one possibly could be sterner

Than you have been with me.

There's a job that I'm applying for -

Let me put it to you thus:

It's a partnership I'm dying for -

Mr.  and Mrs.  Us.

Before you file it on the shelf

Let me telI you of myself:

Oh, I'm the chappie

To make you happy;

I'll tie your shoes-ies

And chase your blues-ies;

Oh, lady would you -

Oh, telI me, could you use me?



[Polly]

No night Iife for you;

The birds would bore you;

The cows won't know you;

A horse would throw you;

You silly man, you,

To ask me, "Can you use me?"



[Bobby]

Do you realize what a good man

You're getting in me?

I'm no Elk or Mason or Woodman

Who gets home at three.



[Polly]

Your ties are freakish;

Your knees are weakish;

Go back to flappers

And high-balI lappers.

Though you can use me

I most certainly can't use you!
