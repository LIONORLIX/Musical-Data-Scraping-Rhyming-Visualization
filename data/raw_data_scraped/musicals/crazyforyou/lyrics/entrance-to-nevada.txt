[The Follies Girls]

It's wonderful to breeze around,

They seem to have real trees around,

And of the open spaces there's no doubt -

No doubt!  No doubt!

This is the life that Riley told about.

In town we used to fret away

Until we made our getaway

Out here where there's no doubt that men

Are men,

Where men are men!

We don't care if we don't go east again.

We haven't missed old Broadway or the

White lights -

When the moon at night lights -

That's the best of bright lights.



[The Boys]

In town they used to fret away

Until they made their getaway

Out here where there's no

Doubt that men are men,

Where men are men!

They don't care if they

Don't go east again.

In town we used to fret away

Until we made our getaway

We don't care if we don't go east again
