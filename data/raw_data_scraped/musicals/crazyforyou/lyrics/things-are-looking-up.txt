Things Are Looking Up


[Bobby]

Things are looking up!

I've been looking the landscape over

And it's covered with four leaf clover,

Oh things are looking up

Since love looked up at me.

Bitter was my cup,

But no more will I be the mourner,

For I've centainly turned the corner.

Oh things are looking up

Since love looked up at me.

See the sunbeams!

Ev'ry one beams

Just because of you.

Love's in session

And my depression

Is unmistakably through.

Things are looking up!

It's a great little world we live in!

Oh I'm happy as a pup

Since love looked up -

Oh I'm happy as a pup

Since love looked up at me!!
