Throw It Out


Mimi

Stupid books,

all his reading,

his brains bleeding,

I know why

Cause of books

they have made his brain explode



Damn these books,

so much flotsam,

I could plotsum I distressed,

Who'd have guessed,

books would make his brain explode.



Book called mother courage,

always about mothers

what about the others, fathers and the brothers

Throw it out



Teres a mothers kisses, always it's the misses

Never its the tata, literary the schmata

Throw it out



If I don't throw out the books

I will throw myself out the window



Asshole, yesser he's an asshole

How can he just sit there,

Thinking he will die

Asshole

where's his fight and vigor

this then is my rigorous reply



Book my Norman Mailer,

Throw it out, egotistic jew

how to meet a saylor, good son

throw it out, what's a mom to do

Search for Warren Harding who's he, show him out, I just keep discarding you'll see

Throw it out, and you'll come through

Here's what you'll do, throw it out



I trust he won't see me crying,

I'll keep on denying what's becoming clear

Tts just, even though he's dying

he will see me laugh and joke and snear



Throwing out is petty which i must admit, but it's deeply felt

Still i'm getting ready to deal with the shit I've been lately dealt.

Bye bye goes his trollop,

bye bye life sure packs a wollup which I won't deny, but will come through

Here's what we'll do

Throw it out



Long live what's mine,

screw all of Gertrude Stein



Throw

Throw

Throw

Throw

Throw it out
