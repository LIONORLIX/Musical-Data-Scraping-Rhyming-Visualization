Heart And Music


MINISTER

Stories of passion

Stories of friendship

and tales of how romance survives



GORDON SCHWINN

I have so many songs



MINISTER

Stories of yes-es

of frogs making messes

and poor unsuccessful and fat people's lives



GORDON SCHWINN

Stories of living

Stories of dying

and ways we can deal with our fear

Stories of horses, parental divorces

and how rich or poor, it's a very small sphere

where we appear



But you gotta have heart and music

Heart and music

Heart and music get along



ENSEMBLE

You gotta have heart and music

You gotta have heart and music

Heart and music make a song



GORDON SCHWINN

If I only had the time

What I would write for your delight



MINISTER

Stories of illness



GORDON SCHWINN

Stories of illness



MINISTER

Songs of improving



GORDON SCHWINN

Songs of improving



ENSEMBLE

And everyone talks about change



GORDON SCHWINN

I have so many songs



ENSEMBLE

Stories of stillness,

of people not moving



GORDON SCHWINN

And throwing out books when things turn out too strange

We rearrange



ENSEMBLE

But you gotta have heart and music

Heart and music

Heart and music get along (you gotta have heart and music)



You gotta have heart and music

You gotta have heart and music

Heart and music make a song



Oh, you gotta have heart and music

You gotta have Heart and music

Heart and music get along



Oh you gotta have heart and music

You gotta

Heart and music make a song



You'll always get along with your heart

With your heart and music



GORDON SCHWINN

Heart and music make



ENSEMBLE

Heart and music make

Heart and music make a song



Heart and music make a song
