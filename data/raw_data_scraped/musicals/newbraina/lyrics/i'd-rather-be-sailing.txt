I'd Rather Be Sailing


I'd rather be sailing, yes, I would

On an open sea

I'd stand at the railing if I could

Feeling wild and free



The sun is on my neck, the wind is in my face

The water's incredibly blue

And I'd rather be sailing

Yes, I'd wanna go sail

And then come home to you



Sex is good but I'd rather be sailing

Food is nice but I'd rather be sailing

People are swell but I'd rather be sailing

Over the horizon



And I'd rather be sailing, yes, I would

On an open sea

I'd stand there inhaling if I could

Feeling wild and free



The sun is on my neck, the wind is in my face

The sea is incredibly blue

And I'd rather be sailing

Yes, I'd wanna go sail

And then come home to you



I'd rather be sailing

Yes, I'd wanna go sail

And then come home to you
