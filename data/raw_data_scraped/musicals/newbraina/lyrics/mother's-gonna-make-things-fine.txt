Mother's Gonna Make Things Fine


MIMI

Sweetheart!



GORDON

Mother!



MIMI

Mother?s gonna file her nails

Mother?s gonna stay serene

What I mean

Is she?ll protect you-hey!

I?m bringing you a new day-yes

Today will be a new day

And even though it shits

Mother?s gonna fix things

Try to keep your wits

Mother?s gonna make things fine



GORDON

Ugh! Ma?



MIMI

In the darkest of dark despair

I?ll be found

Sitting there



GORDON

Ma!

If you want me to say life?s fair

That is something can?t say



MIMI

Anyway

Mother?s gonna drink champagne

Ma will help you beat the odds

She?ll explain

Why she?s so damn blas?

Because I?m bringing you a new day-yes

I?m welcoming a new day!

And mother will protect

Mother?s gonna fix things

Anything that?s wrecked

Mother?s gonna make things fine



GORDON

Ma-a-a-a!



MIMI

Yes! I?m bringing you a new day



GORDON

She?s bringing me a new day



MIMI

Yes, yes! Yes, a fabulous anew day!



GORDON

A fabulous anew day



BOTH

And mother will protect

Mother?s gonna fix things

Anything that?s wrecked

Mother?s gonna make things fine
