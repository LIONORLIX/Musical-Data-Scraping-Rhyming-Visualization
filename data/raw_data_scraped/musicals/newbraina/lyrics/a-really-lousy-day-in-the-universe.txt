A Really Lousy Day In The Universe


LISA:

Hey mister! Hey you!

What are you looking so sad for?



ROGER:

Nothing, really nothing, absolutely nothing

How about some money?



LISA:

I can?t refuse

I need new shoes and some pants

I need romance

What about you?



ROGER:

Tonight, after eight long hours he appeared

It was worse than the doctor had feared

And then the doctor said, ?I hoped by now he?d be awake;

At least I thought he?d be awake. My mistake!?



Then I prodded him and poked him

And his mother started crying

And then Rhoda started yelling at the nurse

It was a really lousy day in the universe



LISA:

You love him

Too bad

What are you looking surprised for?



ROGER:

We hoped things would turn out better



LISA:

Things don?t get better

They only seem to

Then they don?t

Don?t be surprised

When life turns out to be

A trashy old catastrophe



Hey mister!

It?s all right

Life is a rotten occasion



ROGER:

Let me give you money



LISA:

Please forget the money

Please do not insult me

I?m not amused



ROGER:

But it?s therapy



LISA:

I give therapy for free

I?m just glad to have a client finally



ROGER:

So I called his name and hugged him

But the jerk is in a coma

And his mother hopes he dies if he gets worse

It was a really lousy day in the universe



LISA:

They all are

They all are
