Time And Music


Stories of Mothers,

Stories of Boyfriends,

And tales of how romance survives.

(I give you Time)



Stories of Living,

Of almost forgiving,

And poor, unsuccessful and fat people's lives.



But you gotta have time and music.

You gotta have time and music.

Time and music get along.



You gotta have time and music

You gotta have time and music

You gotta have time and music

Time and music make a song.



Oh you gotta have time

(G2: Time)

and music

(M: Everybody gotta have time and music)

(G: Time and music)

(G2: You gotta have time)

You gotta have time and music

(G: Time and music)

(M: You gotta have time and music)

(G2: Time)

(M: Or you're never gunna get along)

Time and music get along.

(M: No, no no no no have time)

(G: You gotta have some time and music.

yeah yeah yeah.)

(G2: You'll always get along with your time and music.)



Oh you gotta have time

(G2: Time)

and music

(M: Everybody gotta have time and music)

(G: Time and music)

(G2: You gotta have time)

You gotta have time and music

(G: Time and music)

(M: You gotta have time)



Time and music make.

Time and music make.

Time and music make.



Make a song

Make a song

Make a song
