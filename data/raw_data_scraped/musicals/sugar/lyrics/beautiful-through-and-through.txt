Beautiful Through And Through


OSGOOD:

Do you think I merely wish to toy with you?

Do you?

When I have sought you near and far?

If you cannot believe my boundless joy with you

You underestimate the girl you are



Some girls in this world

Have bits of that or this

Daises for two eyes

Butterflies for lips



But I've met an angel who

Is lovely from the inside out

And beautiful through and through



Crash! Swept off my feet

By love I can't suppress

Could you be unaware

Of treasures you possess

An angel who

Is lovely from the inside out

And beautiful through and through



Hear my heart call you

OO OO OO OO OO OO

My dreams are all you

OO OO OO OO OO OO

Could you but love me

OO OO OO OO OO OO



JERRY:

God this is lovely!



OSGOOD:

Somewhere in the soul

Are passions that astound

Suddenly love's poems

Are vibrant and profound

And miracles can come true

You dance the roof-tops of the world

And have to confess the view is beautiful



JERRY:

OO OO OO OO OO



OSGOOD:

So beautiful



JERRY:

OO OO OO OO OO



BOTH:

Through and through



God this is lovely



OSGOOD:

It's beautiful



JERRY:

LA LA LA LA LA LA



OSGOOD:

So beautiful



JERRY:

LA LA LA LA LA LA



BOTH:

Through and through
