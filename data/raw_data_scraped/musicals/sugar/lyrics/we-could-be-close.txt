We Could Be Close


SUGAR:

I'm a dreamer, completely unrealistic



JERRY:

You've described my main characteristic



SUGAR:

Listen sweetie, yes indeedy



BOTH:

We... We could be close



SUGAR:

I'm a Pisces



JERRY:

And I was born a Taurus



SUGAR:

Gosh, we've got the planets goin' for us



JERRY:

Listen sweetie, yes indeedy



BOTH:

We... we could be close



JERRY:

We could be... we... you and me could be

As close as any two sisters could be



BOTH:

Bobbin' around... throbbin' like two can-a-a-ries

Share alike, shares-y shares-y!



SUGAR:

I've got three sisters

Three sisters and a brother

I'd love to have some kids

At some time or another



JERRY:

Sometimes I worry

That I'll never be a mother



BOTH

I can see, how you and me

We could, we could be close



JERRY:

We'll lounge around and answer our mail



SUGAR:

Or rush downtown if there is a sale



JERRY:

Don't you just love

Trying on merchandise

I've been wondering what's your size



SUGAR:

I'm a size eight, a size eight with a C cup



JERRY:

I'm a forty, a forty with a wee cup



SUGAR:

You pad with cotton?



JERRY:

I almost was forgotten!



BOTH:

We... we could be close



SUGAR:

You've got something that really is worth prizing



JERRY:

I've got something even more surprising



BOTH:

I can see how you and me

We could... we could be close!
