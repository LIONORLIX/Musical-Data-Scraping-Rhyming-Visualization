The Beauty That Drives Men Mad


JOE & JERRY:

Hello world, they call us Daphne and Josie

A thousand pounds of paradise from head to toesy

Here is the kind of beauty

The drives a man m-m-m-mad

Please watch how close the kiddies get

This ain't no erector set

This here's the beauty that drives a man mad



Ooh what looks we get from cabbies and truckers

When we go by it's like the whole world puckers

Here is the kind of beauty

That drives a man m-m-m-mad

The way this stuff undulates

It should carry license plates

This here's the beauty that drives a man mad



(dance break)



Our beauty rocks 'em and our perfume slays 'em

They say it's bottled in a French gymnas'yum

Here is the kind of beauty

That drives a man m-m-m-mad

This here fancy frillery

Just hides big artillery

This here's the beauty that drives a man mad



When you wish upon a star

Sometimes angels can go too far

With the beauty

That drives a man



M-M-M-Mad

M-M-M-Mad

M-M-M-Mad!!
