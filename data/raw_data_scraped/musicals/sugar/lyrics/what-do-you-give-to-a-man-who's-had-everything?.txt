What Do You Give To A Man Who's Had Everything?


JOE:

The experts used to try

One by one they'd plunge in

TIll Freud threw up his hands

And Adler threw the sponge in

In spite of deep concern and consultation

They were up against a stone wall of frustration



SUGAR: (spoken)

I'd sure like to help



JOE:

Sorry! Sorry!



What do you give to a man

Who's had everything

Man who's had everything

What a complication



Where do you go

With a man who's been everywhere

Been there and back

Seeking new sensation



What's a surprise

When two eyes have seen everything

Sights that most others have not



What do you give to a man

Who's had everything

Been everywhere

Seen everything

Tried Heaven knows what

Of course, you might give it a shot



Been all around

And covered ground

All others have missed

What do you give to a man

Who's had everything

Where in the world's a new twist



SUGAR:

Would my kidd have zing

To a man who's had everything

See if I even come near



(spoken)

Was that anything?



JOE:

(spoken)

Thanks just the same1



(sung)

It just didn't start to unfreeze

My cold heart

But I did feel my sinuses clear
