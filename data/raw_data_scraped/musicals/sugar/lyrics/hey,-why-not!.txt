Hey, Why Not!


SUGAR:

He obviously sees something in me

Amazing how quick

Two people can click



Hey, why not

Say, why not

Who can tell?

I could just wind up being Sugar Shell!



I admit that from where I sit

It's touch and go,

Not easy although

Impossible, no!



Imagine me trav'lin

With the swells

Me, such a tiny fish among

The shells



American dreams

Don't take them lightly

Just like that

I might be

Sugar Shell
