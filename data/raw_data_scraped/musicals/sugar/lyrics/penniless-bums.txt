Penniless Bums


JOE & JERRY:

See how two melody masters

Can suffer a string of disasters

And fin'lly become to penniless bums



JERRY:

Duckin' the butcher and laund-er-y



JOE:

Which one to pay is a quand-er-y



BOTH:

So we pay none like penniless bums



Trained for the philharmonic -- we

Offered our souls ironic'ly

Just to be spurned and chronic'ly snubbed.



Rib cages like two xylophones

So thin we're just a pile o' bones

Beggin for crumbs

A grief that numbs

Just like to pitiful penniless bums



MUSICIANS (MEN):

We're disgusted with being busted

Like poor unfortunate slobs

Our own union thinks we're inhuman

A line this long and no jobs

They can't lose ya' know

We pay dues ya' know

Then end up gettin' this

We're not mad because we've been had

But it's us'lly done with a kiss



JOE & JERRY:

We'll end up like panhandle-ers moochin' a dime

Sleepin' in some damn door with a half pint of wine



JOE & JERRY (MUSICIANS):

We're disgusted with being busted (See how to melody masters)

Our gosh darn union thinks we're (Can suffer)

Inhuman (A string of disasters)

It's practice, practice, and (And fin'lly become two)

Study, Study (Penniless)

Where's it get you, buddy? (Bums)



We find our minds in a (Duckin' the butcher and)

Constant quandary (Laundery)

Owe the butcher, we owe (Which one to pay is a)

The laundery (Quandary)

Which one to pay, well, (So we pay none like)

It's hard to say (Penniless)

So we pay no-body (Bums)



ALL:

Trained for the philharmonic

We offered our souls ironic'ly

Just to be spurned and chronic'ly snubbed



JOE & JERRY:

Rib cages like to xylophones

So thin we're just a pile o' bones

Beggin' for crumbs

A grief that numbs



ALL:

Just like to pitiful penniless

Suff'ring harassment

Cruel Embarrassment

Our own union thinks we're inhuman

Just like to pitiful,

Penniless, broken-down,

Beaten-up



Just like to pitiful penniless bums!
