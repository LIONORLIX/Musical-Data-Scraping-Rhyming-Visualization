Paris Makes Me Horny


Norma

Pookieeeeeeeeeeee!

King

Yeah!

Norma

Hurry up!

King

What's the rush?

Norma

You know what they say, when in Paris...

King

It's when in Rome!

Norma

No, Rome makes me hungry...Paris makes me...hum...horny!

Rome maybe hot, sexy it is not.

Paris is so sexy.

Ridin' in a taxi gives me apoplexy.

Been ta Lisbon and Lisbon is a has-been.

Schlepped ta Stockholm, an' brought a lotta schlock home.

Also Oslo, and Oslo really was slow.

Paris makes me horny;

It's not like "Californy"

Paris is so dizzy;

Jack , it's such an aphrodisiac! oooooh!

It's true. Paris thrills me.

When I see the Eiffel Tower,

I have to go and take a shower.

It's true, I do.

Paris kills me,

And it makes me sexy.

As for Madrid, save it for El Cid.

Dinin' at the Lido loosens my libido

Like a big torpedo.

Seen Geneva, it's hardly jungle fever.

Been ta Bussels could use some red corpuscles.

Tried Toronto, departed "molto pronto".

Paris makes me tingle;

Makes me glad and single.

London's okay, if it's for one day.

Oh, but Paris makes me sexy

In this solar plexy

[speaking]

What's the matter, you're still thinking about the Count?

[singing]

Been ta Munich, where ev'ry guy's a eunuch.

An' ta Dublin, things ain't exactly bubblin'.

Hate Helsinki, the Finns are kinda kinky

But Paris...my ...ah, ah, ah, Paris!

Oh, yeah! Paris makes me... oh, oh, oh...Pooky!
