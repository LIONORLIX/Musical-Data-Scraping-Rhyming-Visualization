Crazy World

Crazy world

Full of crazy contradictions

Like a child.

First you drive me wild,

And then you win my heart

With your wicked art.

One minute tender, gentle,

Then temp'ramental as a summer storm.

Just when I believe your heart's getting warmer,

You're cold and you're cruel,

And I, like a fool, trying to cope,

Trying to hang on to hope.

Crazy world,

Ev'ryday the same old roller coaster ride.

But I've got my pride,

I won't give in,

Eventhough I know I'll never win.

Oh, how I love this

Crazy world.

But I've got my pride,

I won't give in,

Eventhough I know I'll never win.

Oh, how I love this

Crazy World.
