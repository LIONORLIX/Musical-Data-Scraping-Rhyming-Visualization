If I Were a Man


Victoria

Well, I guess I can relay to that, I mean honestly there have

been times in my life when I wished I were a man!

Toddy

Why, for heaven's sake?

Victoria

Oh, that's easy...

If I were a man,

I could do a lot of things a woman never can.

Toddy

Like what, for example?

Victoria

Be free to plot and plan,

Free to live my life without permission from a man.

Man assumes that the world is tailor made for him,

Which it is.

He presumes that the world indulges ev'ry whim,

If it's his.

What a fabulous pursuit,

Hands in pockets, running things;

I must say, it appeals.

In my hundred dollar suit,

Toying with my golden fob-watch

As I make my deals.

Lucky man who is not made to feel

Like an also-ran.

What a lovely life I'd plan,

If I were a man.

I would build all the tallest buildings

Reaching up to the sky.

I'd explore ev'ry far off land,

And I would learn how to fly!

What a triumph it would be,

Doing all that fellas do, but better,

And with style.

Would be just my cup-of-tea;

They will all be furious,

And I would simply smile.

As a man, I would not need to feel like an also-ran.

Though I know I never can, ever be a man.

Oh, the life that I would plan,

If I were a man!
