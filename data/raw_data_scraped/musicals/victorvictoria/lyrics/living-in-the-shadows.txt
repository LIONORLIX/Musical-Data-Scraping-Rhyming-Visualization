Living in the Shadows


Victoria

Living in the shadows,

Hiding from the sunlight,

Hiding from the one light that might help to guide you.

Hiding from tomorrow,

Hiding from the day,

Only brings a sorrow

That won't go away

Wand'ring in the darkness,

Living ev'ry midnight,

Doesn't ever rid night of nightmares as love might.

Life is full of dangers,

Strangers ev'ry turn.

Living in the shadows,

That's no way to learn...

The more you learn,

The more you seek,

The more you find,

The more you care,

The more the world is kind.

One thing I can tell you:

Life should be your lover,

Help you to discover your reason for being.

Soon you will be seeing

What you're all about.

Living in the shadows,

You'll never find out.

Living in the shadows

I'll never find out...
