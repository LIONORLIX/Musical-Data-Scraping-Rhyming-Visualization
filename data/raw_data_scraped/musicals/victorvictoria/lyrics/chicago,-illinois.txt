Chicago, Illinois


Norma

Trendy trav'lers tend to talk

Of London, Paris, Rome, New York,

Like only they were stylish and unique.

But out in the Midwest

Is the city I love the best:

A town so smart it's spelling stars

With: C - H - I - C...Chic!

Chicago, Illinois, is like a shiny toy.

The prairie State is proud to sate

That it's its pride and joy.

The Windy City sweeps ya clean off ya feet;

POW!

Its charm is complete;

POW!

They're knockin' ya flat, this way or that

On ev'ry downtown street.

POW!

The White Sox and the Cubs

And other sporting clubs

Make living here a pretty nifty ploy.

Smack on the lake, this is the report!

Someday, they say, we'll have an airport!

When they say: "hey, I'm from Chi!",

They mean Chicago, Il-li-nois!

[Speaking]

Not Detroit, not Des Moines, not even Pittsburgh!

Poo poo pee doo...Poo pee doo pow!

[Cheers]

[Singing]

When they say: "hey, I'm from Chi!",

They mean Chicago, Illinois!

Chorus

Chicago, Illinois, is like a shiny toy.

The prairie State is proud to sate

That it's its pride and joy.

The Windy City sweeps ya clean off ya feet;

Its charm is complete;

They're knockin' ya flat, this way or that

On ev'ry downtown street.

Oh...Wow...Wow! Humm...Humm...Ooh...Ooh!

The White Sox and the Cubs

And other sporting clubs

Make living here a pretty nifty ploy.

Smack on the lake, this is the report!

Someday, they say, we'll have an airport!

When they say: "hey, I'm from Chi!",

They mean Chicago, Il-li...

Chicago is the killer.

They mean Chicago, Illi...

C-H-I-C-A-G-OOOOOOOOOOOO, Illinois, Wow!
