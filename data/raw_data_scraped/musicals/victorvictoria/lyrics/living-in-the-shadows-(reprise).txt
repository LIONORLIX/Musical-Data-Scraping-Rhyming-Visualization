Living in the Shadows (Reprise)


King

Good to see you, Sal. What brings you to Paris?



Sal

Fairy tales!



King

And somebody called?



Norma

There he is, the Count! And he's Mr. Tod, the Count's former lover, you

know? You want the truth, ask the count!



Sal

You ask him...



Norma

I already know the answer.



Sal

Norma!



Norma

Are you King's lover?



King

I love him very much!



Norma

Oh, God!



Sal

I'm gonna throw up!

Here, sign this... Since that I don't like being in business with homos,

I'm buying you out!



Victoria

Oh, darling, don't do it!



King

Ok, sweetheart!



Sal

Jesus, King, That's disgusting!



Victoria

[Pushing Norma]

That's it!



Norma

Take your hands off me!



Victoria

Go on, go on upstairs on the bed!



Norma

Wait! Lock the door...



Victor

I've got a surprise for you...Dah daaah!



Norma

[Screams]

You no good two-timing son of a bitch...He's a woman!



Victor

Yes, yes

Yes...

The more I leer

The more I seek

The more I find

The more I care

The more the world is kind

One thing I can tell you

Life should be your lover

Help you to discover your reason for being

Soon you will be seeing

What you're all about

Living in the shadows

You'll never find out

Push away the shadows

The sun will come out!
