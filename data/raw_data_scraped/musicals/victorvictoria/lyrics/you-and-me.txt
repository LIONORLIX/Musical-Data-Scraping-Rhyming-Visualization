You and Me


Victor and Toddy

You and me,

We're the kind of people other people

Would like to be.



Toddy

A little strolling?



Victor

Why not!



Both

Wand'ring free,

We present the kind of picture

People are glad to see.

And we don't care that tomorrow

Comes with no guarantee;

We've each other for company.

And come what may,

You and me, we'll stay together

Year after year,

Won't we, my dear?

"That's why we're you and...



Victor

Me!



Toddy

Walk this way



Victor

Oh!



Toddy

I taught him everything he knows



Victor

And that's why he has so little left, oh!



Toddy

I'll get you for that



Victor

[whistling]



Toddy

Oh, I love this guy!



Victor

Out!



Toddy

Careful now!



Victor

Humm...



Toddy

Twice



Both

Ah...Ah!



Toddy

I can fool you...



Victor

No, you can't!

Watch, Toddy!

Humm...oom...

Dah dam dah dah!



Toddy

You're on your own, kid!



Victor

What! What! Oh, Toddy!

Humm...oom...



Both

And come what may,

You and me, we'll stay together

Year after year,

Won't we my dear?

We'll always be you and me.

We'll always be you ...and...

Me!
