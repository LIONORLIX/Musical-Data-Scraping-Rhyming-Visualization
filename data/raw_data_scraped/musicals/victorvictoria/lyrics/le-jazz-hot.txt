Le Jazz Hot


M.C.

Ladies and Gentlemen, meine Damen und Herren, Madames and Monsieurs.

It's with great pleasure that I introduce to you one of

the most sensational true unique talent of this century,

the one and only: Victor!

Male Singer

'Bout twenty years ago way down in New Orleans,

A group of fellers found a new kind of music.

An' they decided to call it...

All

Jazz!

Male Singer

No other sound had what this music has.

Before they new it, it was whizzin' 'round the world.

The world was ready for a blue kind of music,

An' now they play it from Steamboat Springs to La Paz.

There is a story that began in New Orleans,

About this lady who discovered this music.

She fell completely in love with...

All

Jazz!

Male Singer

No one has loved it like this lady has.

They say today the lady travels 'round the world;

You'll only see her where they're playin' this music

That's why they've seen her from Steamboat Springs to La Paz.

Jazz as her escort, to give her jazzamatazz!

Victor

Oh baby, won't you play me

Le Jazz Hot, maybe,

And don't ever let it end.

I tell ya friend, it's really somethin' to hear.

I can't sit still when there's that rhythm near me.

Also, baby, Le Jazz Hot, maybe

What's holdin' my soul together!

Don't know whether it's mornin' or night;

Only know it's soundin' right.

So come on in and play me

Le Jazz Hot, baby,

'Cause I love my Jazz...hot!

All

Before they knew it, it was whizzin' 'round the world.

The world was ready for a blue kind of music,

Victor

An' now they play it from Steamboat Springs to La Paz.

All

Won't you play me ...

Jazz hot, baby...

Don't...let...it...end!

Victor

I tell ya friend, it's really somethin' to..

All

I tell ya friend, it's really somethin' to...

Hear!

Victor

I can't sit still when there's that...

All

Rhythm near me.

Victor

'Cause I love my Jazz...Hot!

When you play me Le Jazz Hot, baby

You're holdin' my soul together

All

Don't know whether it's mornin' or night;

Only know it's soundin' right;

Victor

So come on in and play me

Le Jazz Hot, baby,

'Cause I love my Jazz Hot

Love...Jazz...

Hooooooooooooooooooot!

Le Jazz Hot!
