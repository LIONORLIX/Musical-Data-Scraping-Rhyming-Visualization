Almost a Love Song


Victor

So, what do we do?



King

You want me to be honest?



Victor

Always!



King

I could never live with you this way.



Victor

Because you are frightened that people will think that you're in love

with a man?



King

Right!



Victoria

So we have a problem...



King

I guess we have!



Victoria

What we have here is almost a love song.

I'm perfect for you , you're perfect for me.

Ev'rything they sing about we have in profusion;

The same sense of humor, a romance more than mere illusion.



King

So why are we almost a love song?

Why aren't we the song of the year? Does the moment go by?



Victoria

Are we frightened to try?



King

If we are, more's the pity,



Victoria

For the idea seems so pretty...to be almost a love song.



King

You owe me a love song.



Both

So where is my love song, my dear?



Victoria

Seriously, maybe it's for the best, sooner or

later I'd probably ask you to stop being a gangster,

because I was worried about everybody thinking that

I was your mole.



King

I'm not a gangster, I'm a businessman!



Victoria

A business doing business with gangsters claiming

he's not a gangster; sounds a lot like the kind of

act I do! I think we're both pretenders and I guess

this is not a really good basis for a relationship,

but it was fine while it lasted...

[she leaves]



King

One thing's clear here:



Victoria

It's clear



King

We're almost a love song.



Victoria

We're almost a love song.



King

She's so good for me,



Victoria

I'm no good for him,



King

I'm no good for her.



Victoria

He's so good for me...I imagined somebody...



King

I saw someone...



Victoria

Who looks at things my way.



King

We'll travel life's highway.



Victoria

Whatever the weather,



King

But I wonder whether



Both

The two of us should be together.



Victoria

So, why are we almost a love song,



King

Are we a love song?



Victoria

Instead of the song of the year?



King

Not a good one, I fear ... Will the moment go by?



Victoria

Will I lose him? Are we frightened to try?



King

Mustn't lose her...if I do...



Victor

If we are...



Both

Then it's tragic; he and I have too much magic



Victoria

Then it's tragic; she and I have too much magic.



Both

To be almost a love song ...



King

Hell, I might as well face it.



Victoria

You owe me a love song...



King

I could never replace it.



Victoria

So, where is our love song, my dear?



King

Where is our love song, my dear?
