Victor Victoria


M.C

Ladies and gentlemen, once again and with great pleasure that I introduce for

your kind pleasure the world's foremost female impersonator. But it's also with

great sadness that I must tell you that he has decided to retire and what you're

about to see is his last performance.



Chorus

A thousand artists have done their damnedest to paint her,

But all in vain.

And ev'ry day their hopes grow fainter;

The reason's plain.

For Victoria's also known as Victor,

Making it tricky to depict her.

Victor Victoria, Victor Victoria,

Victoria, what a victor you are!

She spreads confusion; her illusion is serene.

Behind the screen, is he a king or is she a queen?

She's such a tease; fellas like these,

Trying to please, get ill at ease.

Not sure if he's: Louee or Louise...



Company:

No wonder...

Thousands of lovers struggle to win her

Without success.

Even an evening having dinner,

She won't say yes.

And God help the guy who ever tricked her;

Kiss 'em goodbye if they afflict her.

Victoria

No wonder...

Male friends, also

Female, keep sending me

Mail; wond'ring can

She be male?

They all pursue me, and

Woo me, and misconstrue me.



Company:

Victor Victoria, Victor Victoria,

Victoria, what a victor you are!

Men are so dim fancying him and fancying her.

They're so bemused, they get confused

Which one they prefer.



Is he a she? Is she a he?

If you ask me, it's hard to see.

Is he a she? Is she a he?

If you ask me,



Which she can be?



Victoria

There's no guarantee.

And so when young men and old men,

Turning to bold men, to hold my hand,

They get too frazzled and bedazzled

To understand.



Company

You can't contradict her or predict him;

She is a victor, not the victim.

Victor Victoria, Victor Victoria,



Labisse

[speaking]

Stop! Make way-dancing fools...

Ladies and gentlemen, you are victims of a cruel hoax,

This woman is no man!



Toddy

I'm man enough for you, sweetheart!



Company

And that's why...all young men and old men

Turning to bold men to hold her hand...

They get to frazzled and bedazzled

To understand.

You can't contradict her or predict him.

She is a victor not the victim.

Victor Victoria,

Victor Victoria,

Victoria, what a victor you are!



Toddy

So when a guy loves a lady,

However shady it may appear...

No need to yell if they're two fellers;

That's not so queer.



Victoria and Toddy

We'll all meant to cherish one another;



Squash

It's not a crime to love each other!



Toddy

(speaking)

He sings too!



Chorus

Victor Victoria,

Victor Victoria,

Victoria, what a victor you are!

Victoria, what a victor you are!

Aaaaaaah!
