Could We Get Any Older?


Could we get any older?

Our youth is just slipping away

We?re trying real hard to act the part

I?m sure that we?ll be cool someday



This one looks like he still lives

at home with Mom

And this one took his best friend

as a date to the prom

And this one smells like feet

And really likes to eat

How could you not love this guy? [Rodel?]



Could we get any older? [Get any older?]

I think that we can die right now

Underneath the cool fa?ade,

We?re still real odd

We?re major fucking dorks and how



This one looks like she needs

To wear a push-up bra

And this one goes to the

Renaissance Faire, ?Huzzah!?

You got all the Buffy episodes on DVD

Because you wish you looked

As skinny as her



Could we get any older? [I don?t think so!]

You?re clinging on to your youth

You act real cool like you never ditched school

But everybody knows the truth

You throw parties every week

Just to pass the time

And then everybody leaves for you

To clean up the grime

And then you?re stuck at home all alone

Wishin? you could find a man



Could you get any lamer?

I?m sorry if I?m sounding blunt

But if you can?t hang

With what I just sang

You can shove it up your cuuuuuuuuuunt!
