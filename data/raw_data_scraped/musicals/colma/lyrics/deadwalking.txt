Deadwalking


Deadwalking quietly through the graves

The grass of the graveyard beneath my feet

Ev?ryone sleeping, I feel the hush

My heart steady pulsing the only beat



These are the main Colma Residents

For this is the true population now

Graveyards & tombstones throughout the hills

There?s more of them dead than alive in town



Come dance with me ?til the sun goes down



This is my future main residence

Just deadwalking nowhere and everywhere

No one and everyone knows your name

And nothing and ev?rything in the end



We will be resting beneath the soil

And flying so high up above the ground

Nothing to heinous to worry us

And nothing bad either to cry about



Come dance with me ?til the sun goes down



Deadwalking quietly through the graves

[This is my future main residence]

The grass of the graveyard beneath my feet

[Just deadwalking nowhere and everywhere]

Ev?ryone sleeping, I feel the hush

[No one and everyone knows your name]

My heart steady pulsing the only beat

[And nothing and everything in the end]



These are the main Colma Residents

[We will be resting beneath the soil]

For this is the true population now

[And flying so high up above the ground]

Graveyards & tombstones throughout the hills

[Nothing to heinous to worry us]

There?s more of them dead than alive in town

[And nothing bad either to cry about]



Come dance with me [Come dance with me]

Come dance with me [Come dance with me]

Come dance with me ?til the sun goes down



[By the way, Maribel?

What?

Happy Birthday.]
