Colma Stays


Colma stays out of place

While I take the train to a space

I can leave my worries far behind me

If for only eight hours a day

I trace the lines I find upon me

Find my way to Serramonte

I can?t believe how much

It hasn?t changed

It goes to show that Colma stays

And Colma Stays



Colma stays, the rest move forward

I can?t tell, but I move toward

I can?t see the changes

Everybody swears are happening

Before my face

I trace the lines on the floor

Find my way back to Westmoor

I still see the teachers that

I sat before and hated even then

?Cause Colma stays



New York just cleaned up Times Square

San Francisco is right over there

Los Angeles just instated

A new mode of public transit

While Colma stays I guess it?s cool

We got a new police station

Next to the police station



Colma stays, far from disaster

Safe and slow, but people leaving faster

Wish I had a car ?cause where you are

Ain?t very far where Colma stays

I trace the roots undefined

Oh my god! They?re tearing down Lyon?s

Who says that there?s

No progression here in Colma

Can?t they see the signs?



Colma stays next to Daly City

Object of ridicule and pity

New York?s got New Jersey

San Francisco?s got the place

Where Colma stays



I trace the roots of my sadness

Find my way into the mouth of madness

Maybe there?s a reason why

The world goes on and on

While Colma stays

And Colma Stays



London?s got a bustling scene

And Amsterdam?s different standards

Of a scene

Paris got the Louvre and Eiffel Tower

To mark it?s land

While Colma stays

We finally got an In 'N Out Burger

Next to a Krispy Kreme.



Maybe it?s a different way of living

But it?s just the way I?ve lived for so long

How can you say that I?m missing out?

Colma stays, a place I was born

Wanting, sad, forsaken, forlorn

Still I wouldn?t give it up for anybody

I know nothing more

You hear the tone of my voice

Still you think that I have a choice

What more can a girl from Colma

Do than just accept that Colma Stays?

And Colma Stays



Everybody has their call

And everyone in Colma ends up at the mall

Maybe there?s a reason why

The world will never know

Where Colma stays

Colma stays

Colma stays?and you will never know



Colma stays, fast as a tortoise

Colma stays, like rigor mortis

Colma stays, as popular as Tae-bo

Colma stays, but I have to go.
