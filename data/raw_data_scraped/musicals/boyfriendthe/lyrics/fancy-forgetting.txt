Fancy Forgetting


I still recall so tenderly

The night when first we met

The memory's so dear to me

So how can you forget?



Fancy forgetting

The love that we knew

When we were fancy free

Fancy forgetting

What I said to you

And what you said to me



Though the years go by

And our youth is gone

Memories don't die

Like a song they linger on

So just when I thought you'd remember it, too,

Fancy, just fancy you forgetting.



Though the years go by

And our youth is gone

Memories don't die

Like a song they linger on

So just when I thought you'd remember it, too,

Fancy, just fancy you forgetting.
