A Room In Bloomsbury


A life of wealth does not appeal to me at all

Do you agree at all?

I do

The mere idea of living in a palace is

So full of fallacies

That's true

I've got a very different sort of scheme in mind

It's just a dream designed

For two

Would you care to hear about it, dear?

Would I care to? Can you doubt it, dear?



All I want is a room

In Bloomsbury

Just a room that will do

For you and me

One room's enough for us

Though is on the top floor

Life may be rough for us

But its troubles we'll ignore

On a Wintery night

I'll light a fire

Everything I shall do

As you desire

You'll be sitting

And you'll be knitting

And so contented we'll be

In our dear little room in Bloomsbury



All I want is a room

In Bloomsbury

Just a room that will do

For you and me

I'll sew the covers for

Two old cosy armchairs

Neighbours will love us for

We shall laugh at all our cares

While I'm reading a book

I'll cook a stew

Then I'll bake a plum duff

Enough for two



In our attic

We'll be ecstatic

As lovebirds up in a tree

All we want is a room in Bloomsbury
