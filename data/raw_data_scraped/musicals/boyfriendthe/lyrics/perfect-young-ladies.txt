Perfect Young Ladies


We're perfect young ladies

Preparing to take

Our places among the noblesse



We're perfect young ladies

Preparing to make

The most of the charms we possess



We're being finished

And our families' wealth

May be diminished

But at least we all have perfect health

And making the grade is our duty, you see

For perfect young ladies are we



We're perfect young ladies

Who hope to attract

A husband whose credit is good



You may be young ladies

But why don't you act

The way that a young lady should?



I've often told you -

Please don't tell us again

I ought to scold you -

But you know it would be quite in vain



For being our maid is your duty, you see

For perfect young ladies are we -



Perfect young ladies, hm!!



Perfect young ladies are we!!!!
