I Could Be Happy With You


I don't claim that I am psychic

But one look at you and I kick

Away every scruple

I learnt as a pupil

In school my dear



I'm not one to make predictions

But I've thrown off all restrictions,

And I don't mind confessing

I think it's a blessing

That you are here



Though I'm prepared to find I'm wrong

I've got a funny feeling we belong together



I could be happy with you

If you could be happy with me



I'd be contented to live anywhere

What would I care

As long as you were there?



Skies may not always be blue



But one thing is clear as can be



I know that I could be happy with you, my darling



If you could be happy with me.





I could be happy with you

If you could be happy with me

I'd be contented to live anywhere

What would I care

As long as you were there?

Skies may not always be blue

But one thing is clear as can be

I know that I could be happy with you, my darling

If you could be happy with me.
