The 'You-Don't-Want-To-Play-With-Me' Blues


Percy, Percy, please have mercy

Why must you always be so sad and gloomy?

Why can't you be a little nicer to me?

Cheri, Cheri

Please be merry

When I am trying to be bright and jolly

It isn't nice to be so melancholy



Oh, dear,

I've got the you-don't-want-to-play-with-me-blues

Don't-want-to-play-with-me-blues

It's clear

I've got the you-don't-want-to-play-with-me-blues

Don't-want-to-play-with-me-blues



I am so good

At spreading mirth and joy

But it's no good

With such a sulky boy

I try

To play the game the other fellows all choose

The other fellows all choose

I sigh

Because you always refuse

What is a girl to do

With such a boy as you?

I've got those

Dreary, Weary,

You-don't-want-to-play-with-me-blues
