Never Too Late To Fall In Love (Reprise)


Dulcie:

It's never too late to blow a kiss

especially in a time like this



Lord Brockhurst:

and it's never too late to fall in love



Dulcie:

Vo-de-o, vo-de-o, vo-de-o



Lord Brockhurst:

it's never too late too late for fun and larks

a jolly old flame has lots of sparks



Dulcie:

and it's never too late to fall in love



Lord Brockhurst:

Vo-de-o, vo-de-o, vo-de-o



Dulcie:

the modern buildings that you see

are often most alarming



Brockhurst:

but I am sure that you'll agree



Dulcie:

a ruin



Brockhurst:

can be charming



Dulcie:

it's never too late to be a beau



Brockhurst:

experiences count a lot you know



Both:

and it's never too late to fall in

never to late to fall in-

never to late to fall in love
