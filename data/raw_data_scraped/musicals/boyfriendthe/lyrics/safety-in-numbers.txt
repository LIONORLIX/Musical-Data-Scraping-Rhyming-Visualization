Safety in Numbers


You're so fascinating

But it's aggravating

That you keep us waiting

To hear

Which one will be

Your favorite he

You're so very taking

That our hearts are breaking

So you should be making

It clear

Which one of us

You rate Alpha plus



Now listen boys, you should recall

I've often said I love you all



You love us all?

Yes, I love you all!



It's time you learned

That I'm no fool

Where love's concerned

I stick to this rule



There's safety in numbers

That's what I believe

The girl who knows

A lot of beaux

Is never likely to grieve

The lady who slumbers

Is left high and dry

But I'm awake

And never miss

The chance to take

Another kiss

There's safety in numbers

And the more the merrier am I
