The Boyfriend


Any girl who's reached the age

Of seventeen or thereabouts

Has but one desire in view

She knows she has reached the stage

Of needing one to care about

Nothing else will really do



Childhood games are left behind

And her heart takes wing

Hoping that it soon will find

Just one thing



We've got to have,

We plot to have,

For it's a dreary not to have

That certain thing called "The Boy Friend"

We scheme about

And dream about

And we've been known to scream about

That certain thing called "The Boy Friend"



He is really a necessity

If you want to get on

And we might as well confess it

He is a sine qua non



We sigh for him

And cry for him,

And we would gladly die for him

That certain thing called "The Boy Friend"



We plead to have,

We need to have,

In fact our poor hearts bleed to have

That certain thing called "The Boy Friend"

We'd save for him

And slave for him

We'd even misbehave for him

That certain thing called "The Boy Friend"



Life without us is impossible

And devoid of all charms

No amount of idle gossip'll

Keep them out of our arms

We're blue without

Can't do without

Our dreams just won't come true without

That certain thing called "The Boy Friend"



We're blue without

Can't do without

Our dreams just won't come true without

That certain thing called "The Boy Friend"
