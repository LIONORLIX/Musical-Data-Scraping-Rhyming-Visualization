Sur La Plage


What a lovely day

What a lovely day

For a dip in the sea

Oh, what fun it will be

Won't you come and have a swim with me?



But whatever you do

When I'm swimming with you

Please remember not to go too far



Though you may look cute

In your bathing suit

We don't know who you are



There's no knowing

Who you are going

To meet sur la plage



You may run up against a rajah

Or maybe your man

Will be a poor man



Sal or Susie, cannot be choosey

For here love's a guessing game



Sur la plage, sur la plage

Everyone looks the same



There's no saying

Who may be playing

With you sur la plage

A knight who's left behind his charger

May call you "ducky"

Won't you be lucky?

In the ocean

You'll find emotion

May play you a funny game

Sur la plage, sur la plage

Ev'ryone looks the -

Ev'ryone looks the -

Ev'ryone looks the same



Sur la plage, sur la plage

Ev'ryone looks the -

Ev'ryone looks the -

Ev'ryone looks the same
