Been A Long Day


SMITTY:

Well, here it is five P.M.

The finish of a long day's work.

And there they are both of them,

The secretary and the clerk.



Not very well acquainted.

Not very much to say

But I can hear those two little minds

Ticking away.



Now, she's thinking:



ROSEMARY:

I wonder if we take the same bus.



SMITTY:

And he's thinking:



FINCH:

That could be quite a thing between us.



SMITTY:

Now, she's thinking:



ROSEMARY:

He really is a dear.



SMITTY:

And he's thinking:



FINCH:

But what of my career.



SMITTY:

And she says:



ROSEMARY:

Ah! hum...



SMITTY:

And he says:



FINCH:

A hum-hum...

Well it's been a long day.



ALL:

Well, it's been a long,

Been a long, been a long,

Been a long day.



SMITTY:

Now, she's thinking:



ROSEMARY:

I wish that he were more of a flirt.



SMITTY:

And he's thinking:



FINCH:

I guess a little flirting won't hurt.



SMITTY:

Now she's thinking:



ROSEMARY:

For dinner we could meet.



SMITTY:

And he's thinking:



FINCH:

We both've gotta eat, ah....



SMITTY:

And she says:



ROSEMARY:

Atchoo...



SMITTY:

And he says:



FINCH:

Gesundheidt!



ROSEMARY:

Thank you!



FINCH:

Well, it's been a long day!



ALL:

Well, it's been a long,

Been a long, been a long,

Been a long day.



SMITTY:

Hey!

There's a yummy Friday's special at Stouffer's.

It's dollar-ninety vegetable plate.

And on the bottom of the add,

Not bad, service for two,

Three-fifty eight,

To make a bargain, make a date.



ROSEMARY:

Wonderful!



FINCH:

It's fate!



SMITTY:

Now she's thinking:



ROSEMARY:

What the female kind of trap could I spring?



SMITTY:

And he's thinking:



FINCH:

I might as well forget the whole thing.



SMITTY:

Now she's thinking:



ROSEMARY:

Suppose I take his arm...



SMITTY:

And he's thinking:



FINCH:

Well, really what's the harm?



SMITTY:

And she says:



ROSEMARY:

Hungry?



SMITTY:

And he says:



FINCH:

Yeah!



ROSEMARY:

Yeah!



SMITTY:

Yeah!



ALL:

Well, it's been a long day!

Well, it's been a long,

Been a long, been a long,

Been a long day.



COMPANY:

Well, it's been a long,

Been a long, been a long,

Been a long day.
