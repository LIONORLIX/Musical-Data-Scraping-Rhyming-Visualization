Rosemary


FINCH:

Suddenly there is music

In the sound of your name.

Rosemary , Rosemary.

Was the melody locked inside me

'Till at last out it came.



Rosemary, Rosemary.

Just imagine

If we kissed

What a crescendo.



Not to be missed.

As for the

Rest of my life-time program

Give me more of the same.



Rosemary, Rosemary.

There is wonderful music in the very sound

Of your name.



ROSEMARY:

Honey, are you talking about?



FINCH:

Rosemary, the most wonderful thing is happened. Oh, can't you hear it?

Can't you hear it?



Suddenly there is music

In the sound of your name.



ROSEMARY:

I don't hear a thing.



FINCH:

Rosemary...

It's all around... It's like a beautiful pink sky singing...



ROSEMARY:

Now, look here J. Pierpont Finch...



FINCH:

Rosemary, darling, will you please marry J. Pierpont Finch?



ROSEMARY:

Now I hear it! I hear it! I hear it!



Suddenly there is music

In the sound of your name.

J. Pierpont!



FINCH:

Rosemary,

Just imagine

If we kissed

What a crescendo.



BOTH:

Not to be missed.



FINCH:

As for the

Rest of my life-time program

Give me more of the same.



FINCH/ROSEMARY:

Rosemary, Rosemary / J. Pierpont, J. Pierpont

There is wonderful music

In the very sound

Of your name.
