Paris Original


ROSEMARY:

I slipped down this afternoon

And bought some love insurance.

A most exclusive dress from gay Paree.

It's slick, and chick, and magnifique,

With sex beyond endurance.

It's me, it's me, it's absolutely me.



And one, one guy...

This irresistible,

Paris original,

I'm wearing tonight.

I'm wearing tonight.

Specially for him.



MISS KRUMHOLTZ:

This irresistible

Paris original's

I'll pay for a night.

I must look divine.

Specially for him.



Suddenly he will see me,

And suddenly he'll go dream me.

And blame it all long

His own masculine will.

Never knowing that.



This irresistible,

Paris original,

So tempt really tight

I'm wearing tonight.

Specially for him... For him.



This irresistible,

Paris original,

I'm wearing tonight.



She's wearing tonight!

And I could spit!



Someone irresponsible

Dress manufacturer

just didn't play fair.

I'm one of a pair.

And I could...



ROSEMARY & MISS KRUMHOLTZ:

Oh! No!



SMITTY:

This irresistible,

Paris original,



MISS KRUMHOLTZ:

All sticking with seam,

Already supreme

And I could die!



ROSEMARY:

And I could kill her!



BOTH:

And I could...



SMITTY:

This irresistible,

Paris original,

Tres sexy, nes pas.

God dammed! Voi la!



ALL:

And I could spit!



ROSEMARY:

Oh! No!



MISS KRUMHOLTZ:

One more!



SMITTY:

Good Lord!



ROSEMARY:

You...



MISS KRUMHOLTZ:

Me...



SMITTY:

Her...



BOTH:

She...



FINCH:

Good evening, ladies.



ALL:

Oh!

39 bucks I hand out,

For something to made me stand out,

And suddenly I've got into menial ground.



Some left!



ALL:

This irresistible,

Paris original,

This mess had its prime

I'm wearing tonight.

For the very last time.
