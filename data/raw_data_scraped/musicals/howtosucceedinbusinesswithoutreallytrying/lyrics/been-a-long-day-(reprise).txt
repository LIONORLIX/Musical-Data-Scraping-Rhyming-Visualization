Been a Long Day (Reprise)


Uhmm, oh yes I guess so I was just trying to make her feel at home. She seems rather shy...



Now he's thinking



That kid could really put me through hell



And she's thinking



The kid could even name the hotel



Now he's thinking



I wonder if he dare



And she's thinking



There's blackmail in the air



And he says



It's a holdup



And she says



Down



wait a minute



Okay, you're promoted



Well, it's been a long, been a long, been a long, been a long day

Well, it's been a long, been a long, been a long, been a long day

Aaahh
