Love From A Heart Of Gold


J.B.BIGGLEY:

Hedy, I can't live without you.



HEDY:

You mean that?



J.B.BIGGLEY:

Of course I do. Oh, I know I seem to have everything.

Always J.B.Biggley, all money begs, they call me. And

What? Does it all mean? Nothing, Hedy, nothing.

Means anything without you.



HEDY:

Oh, no! wait a minute. Don't start getting sincere. That's not fair.



J.B.BIGGLEY:

Were will I find a treasure,

Like the love from a heart of gold?

Ever trusting and sweat,

And a-waiting my pleasure,

Rain or shine,

Hot or cold.



Wealth far beyond the measure,

Maybe here in my hands I'll hold,

Of it where will I find that one treasure of treasures,

The love from a heart of gold?



HEDY:

I never knew you felt that way!



J.B.BIGGLEY:

Now you knows it, that I'm extremely emotional.



HEDY:

Dammit, so am I!



When will I find a treasure,

Like a love from a heart of gold?

Ever trusting and sweat,

And a-waking my pleasure,

Rain or shine...



J.B.BIGGLEY:

Rain or shine...

Hot or cold.



HEDY:

Hot or cold.



HEDY:

Wealth far beyond the measure,

Maybe here in my hands I'll hold,

Of but where will I find that one treasure of treasures,



BOTH:

The love from a heart of gold?
