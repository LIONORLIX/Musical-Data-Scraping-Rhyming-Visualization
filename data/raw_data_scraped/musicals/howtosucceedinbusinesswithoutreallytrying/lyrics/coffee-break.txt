Coffee Break


FRUMP:

There's no coffee!



COMPANY:

No coffee?! Ohhhhhh!



FRUMP:

If I can't take

My coffee break,

My coffee break,

My coffee break...

If I can't take

My coffee break,

Something within me dies.



SMITTY:

If I can't make

Three daily trips

Where shining shrine

Benignly drips,

And taste cardboard

Between my lips.

Something within me dies.



COMPANY:

Dies down and something within me dies.



No coffee!

No coffee!

No coffee!

No coffee!

No coffee!

No coffee!

No coffee!

No coffee!



SMITTY:

That office's light

Doesn't have to be florescent.

I'll get no pains

In my head.



That office chair

Doesn't have to be foam rubber,

So if I spread, so I spread.

But only one chemical substance

Gets out the lead.



COMPANY:

Like she said?

If I can't take

My coffee break,

My coffee break,

My coffee break...

If I can't take,

My coffee break...



SMITTY & FRUMP:

Gone is the sense of enterprise.



COMPANY:

All gone and something within me dies.



No coffee!

No coffee!

No coffee!

No coffee!

No coffee!

No coffee!

No coffee!

No coffee!

No coffee!

No coffee!



COMPANY:

If I can't take

My coffee break.



SMITTY:

Somehow the soul no longer tries.



COMPANY:

Coffee, coffee...



FRUMP:

Somewhere I don't metabolize.



COMPANY:

Coffee, coffee...



SMITTY & FRUMP:

Something within me ...



COMPANY:

Coffee, or otherwise...

Coffee, or otherwise...

Coffee, or otherwise...



Something inside of me...

Dies!
