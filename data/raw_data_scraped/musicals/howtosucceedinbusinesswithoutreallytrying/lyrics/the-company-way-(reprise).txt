The Company Way (Reprise)


FRUMP:

Oh, me too Mr. Twimble, I know exactly what you mean! From now on:

I'll play it the company way

Wherever the company puts me

There I'll stay.



COMPANY:

Whatever the company tells, that he'll do.



FRUMP:

Whatever my uncle may think,

I think so too.



COMPANY:

Oh, oh, oh, He's meeting the company pride



FRUMP:

I've conquered that over ambitious

Rat inside.



MR. TWIMBLE:

Old buddy's no longer the Frump you use to be.



FRUMP:

I'd pledged to the company sweet conformity.



COMPANY:

Hooray! Hooray!



FRUMP:

I will some day earn my medal,

25 year employee.



I'll see to it,

That the medal,

Is the only thing they'll ever be on me.



COMPANY:

Oh, Frump plays the company way,

Executive policy is by me OK.



FRUMP:

I'll never be President

But that's one thing clear,

As long as my uncle can stand me,

I will still be here.



COMPANY:

We know the company may like.

Or lump any man

And then they'll choose you the Company-Made-Company-Man.



FRUMP:

and happy



COMPANY:

But they will never jump

Frump the company man

Frump will play the company

Frump will play the company

Frump will play the company way.

Yeah!
