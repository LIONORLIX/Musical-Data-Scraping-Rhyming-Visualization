Brotherhood Of Man


FINCH:

Now you may joint the Oak's, my friend,

And may joint the Shriner's.

And other men may carry cards,

As members of the Diner's.



Still others wear a Golden Key,

Or small Greek letter pin.

But I have learn that's one great club,

That all of us are in.



There is a brotherhood of man,

A benevolent brotherhood of man,

A noble tie that binds

All human hearts and minds

Into one brotherhood of man.



Your life long membership is free,

Keep a-giving each brother all you can.

Oh, aren't you proud to be in that fraternity,

The great big brotherhood of man?



So, Wally, before consider firing everybody, remember this:



One man may seem incompetent.

Another not make sense.

Well, others look like quite waste

Of company expense.

They need a brother's leadership.

So, please, don't do them in

Remember mediocrity

Is not a murder sin.
