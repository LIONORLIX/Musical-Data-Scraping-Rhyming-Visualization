Cinderella, Darling


SMITTY:

How often does it happen at a secretary's boss,

Want's to marry her?



FEMALE ENSEMBLE:

Hallelujah!



SMITTY:

How often does the dream come true,

Without a sign of conflict, or barrier?



FEMALE ENSEMBLE:

Hallelujah!



SMITTY:

Why treat the man like he was a typhoid l carrier?

How often can you fly from this land of carbon-paper,

To the land of flowered chintz?



FEMALE ENSEMBLE:

Hallelujah!



SMITTY:

How often does a Cinderella get a crack at the Prince?



FEMALE ENSEMBLE:

Cinderella had a prince.



SMITTY:

Don't you realize, you're a real life fairy tale,

A symbol divine?

So if not for you own sake,

Please darling, for mine!



FEMALE ENSEMBLE:

And mine... And mine... And mine.

Don't... Don't... Don't...

Cinderella, darling

Don't turn down the prince.



SMITTY:

Don't rewrite your story.

You're the legend, the folklore

The working girl's dream of glory.



FEMALE ENSEMBLE:

We were raised on you, darling,

And we've loved you ever since.

Don't mess up on measure miracle.

Don't, Cinderella,

Don't take down the prince.



SMITTY:

Oh, let us live it with you,

Each hour of each day,

On from Bergdorf Goodman



To Elizabeth Harden...

People Station Wagon...

Hurry from Twenty-One...

To the Terrytown P.T.A.

No! New Rochelle.



FEMALE ENSEMBLE:

New Rochelle, P.T.A.



SMITTY:

Oh, do not leave us minus,

Our fight carries a bonus,

We want to see His Highness,

Marry to Your Lowness,

On you, Cinderella, sits the onus,

So when you name a happy day,

Please, phone us,



FEMALE ENSEMBLE:

Pleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeease

Pleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeease

Pleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeease

Oooooooooooooooooooooo

But Don't, Don't...

Don't...Cinderella, darling

Don't turn down the prince.



SMITTY:

Why spoil out our enjoyment?

You're the fable,

The symbol

Of glorified unemployment.



FEMALE ENSEMBLE:

We were raised on you, darling

And we've loved you ever since.

Don't blows up our favorite fairy tale

Don't, Cinderella, Don't

Don't... Don't...

Don't, Cinderella, Don't,

Don't turn down the prince.

FEMALE ENSEMBLE:

Hallelujah!
