Easy to Love


[HOPE]

You're being terribly bad, Billy.

Why, we hardly know each other.



[BILLY]

Yeah, I guess you're right.

Me and you -who am I kidding?

I know too well that I'm

Just wasting precious time

In thinking such a thing could be

That you could ever care for me.

I'm sure you hate to hear

That I adore you, dear,

But grant me, just the same,

I'm not entirely to blame, for...

You'd be so easy to love,

So easy to idolize, all others above,

So sweet to waken with,

So nice to sit down to the eggs and bacon with.

We'd be so grand at the game,

So carefree together that it does seem a shame

That you can't see

Your future with me

'Cause you'd be, oh, so easy to love...

You'd be so easy to love,

So easy to idolize, all others above,

So worth the yearning for,

So swell to keep ev'ry home fire burning for.

Oh, how we'd bloom, how we'd thrive

In a cottage for two, or even three, four or five,

So try to see

Your future with me

'Cause you'd be, oh, so easy to love...



[HOPE]

Billy, this is all wrong.  I'm marrying Evelyn.

Nothing can change that!



[BILLY]

You can change that.  All you have to do is say -



[HOPE]

No!  If you don't let me alone, I'll make a scene!



[BILLY]

You love me, Hope - you're going to marry me!



[HOPE]

'Cause you'd be, oh, so easy to love...
