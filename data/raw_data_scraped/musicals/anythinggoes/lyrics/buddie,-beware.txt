Buddie, Beware


[ERMA]

Come on, fellas, gettin' married's for the birds.

Who needs it?



[CREW]

We do!



[ERMA]

Yeah?



Buddie, beware,

Buddie, better take care,

Though at heart I'm a pearl

I'm a difficult girl,

So, buddie, beware.



When i go to a show,

I prefer the first row.

When invited to dine

I can't eat without wine.

So, buddie beware.



During Christmas holidays

I develop taking ways

And I'm not at all anti

Pretty things Santy

Brings from Cartier's.



Your devotion I prize

But you must realize, my boys,

Other girl's luxuries

Are my necessities,

So, buddie, beware.



I must warn you that I'm

simply never on time,

So, buddie, beware.



Somehow I don't feel

nice when I wear a

dress twice,

So, buddie, beware.



Buddie, beware.

Buddie, better take care.

Since the day i was weened,

I'm a caviar fiend.

So buddie, beware.



I feel I should put you right.

As I lie in bed at night

While the twinkling stars gleam on,

With my cold cream on

I'm a lovely sight.

And another thing too,

When I'm married to you, my sweet,

If to come home you fail,

I'll open all your mail,

So, buddie, beware.
