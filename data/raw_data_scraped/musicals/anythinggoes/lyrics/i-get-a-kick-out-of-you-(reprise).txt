I Get a Kick Out of You (Reprise)


[BILLY]

All right, Captain, let's get on with it.

You've got some weddings to perform here.



[RENO]

Come on, Cap!  I've waited all my life to be a Lady!



[to Lord Evelyn]

I get no kick from champagne.

Mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at all,

So tell me why should it be true



[RENO & EVELYN]

That I get a kick out of you?



[BILLY]

[to Hope]

Some get a kick from cocaine.

I'm sure that if I took even one sniff

That would bore me terrific'ly too



[BILLY & HOPE]

Yet I get a kick out of you.



[ALL]

I get a kick ev'rytime I see

You standing there before me.



[CREW]

[to Erma]

I get a kick though it's clear to me

You obviously don't adore me.



[ALL]

I get no kick in a plane,

Flying too high with some guy in the sky

Is my idea of nothing to do,

Yet I get a kick out of you.
