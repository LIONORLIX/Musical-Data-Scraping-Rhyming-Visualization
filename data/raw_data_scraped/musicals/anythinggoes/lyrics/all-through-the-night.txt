All Through the Night


[BILLY]

All through the night I delight in your love.

All through the night you're so close to me.

All through the night from a height far above,

You and your love bring me ecstasy.

When dawn comes to waken me,

You're never there at all,

I know you've forsaken me

Till the shadows fall,

But then once again I can dream I've the right

To be close to you all through the night.



[HOPE]

All through the night I delight in your love.

All through the night you're so close to me.



[BILLY, HOPE & CREW]

All through the night from a height far above,

You and your love bring me ecstasy.

When dawn comes to waken me,

You're never there at all,

I know you've forsaken me

Till the shadows fall,

And then once again I can dream I've the right



[BILLY]

Staying close to you all through the night,



[CREW]

Through the night.
