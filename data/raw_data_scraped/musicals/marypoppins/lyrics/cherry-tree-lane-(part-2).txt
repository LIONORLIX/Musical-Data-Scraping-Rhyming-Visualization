Cherry Tree Lane (Part 2)


George:

That is quite enough tommy rot for one day!

Would you please go upstairs and let me get to work!

I might have guessed

The wind is blowing

And it's an easterly, It's bound to bring a chill!

I'm underdressed

I must be going

Fetch my gloves and scarf or I'll be later still

Where's my hat?

He's brushed it with boot polish!



All:

Precision and order

That's all that I ask

The running of a household

A straightforward task

The children, the servants

They're all your domain



George:

Whilst I remain the sovereign

Mind you use your day well.



Winifred:

You remain the sovereign



George:

I shall be home at six o'clock sharp.



All:

He remains the sovereign

Of Cherry Tree Lane.
