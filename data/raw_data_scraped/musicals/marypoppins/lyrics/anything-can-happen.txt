Anything Can Happen


Mary Poppins

Anthing can happen if you let it sometimes things are difficult

but you can bet it doesn't have to be some



Jane

Changes can be made



Michael

You can move a mountain if you use a larger spade



Mary Poppins

Anything can happen it's a marvel



Michael

You can be a butterfly



Jane

Or just stay larval



Jane & Michael

Stretch your mind beyond fantastic dreams are made of strong elastic



Mary Poppins

Take some sound advice and don't forget it



Winifred, Jane & Michael

Anything can happen if you let it



Winifred

I wonder.....



Winifred, Jane, Michael & Mary Poppins

Anything can happen if you let it



Winifred

You Won't know a challenge until you've met it



Michael

No one does it for you



Winifred

No one but yourself vacillating violets get left up

on the shelf anything can happen just imagine!



Mary Poppins

That should be my epitah I wear the badge in honour of this world's free thinkers



Winifred

Those who see beyond their blinkers



Jane & Michael

Jelly isn't jelly



Winifred, Jane & Michael

'Till you set it anthing can happen if you let it



Mary Poppins

Anthing can happen if you let it what good is a whistle



Bert

Unless you whet it



Bert & Mary Poppins

Broaden your horizons



Bert

Open different doors



Bert & Mary Poppins

You may find a you there that you never knew was yours



Bert

Anything can happen



Mrs.Corry

Raise the curtain things you thought impossible



Bert & Mrs.Corry

Will soon seem certain though at first it may sound clownish see the world

more upside-downish turn it on its head then pirouette it



Bert, Mrs. Corry

Anything can happen if you let it



Mary Poppins

If you reach for the stars all you get are the stars

but we've found a whole new spin if you reach for the heavens



All

You get the stars thrown in if you reach

for the stars all you get are the stars but we've found a whole new spin if you

reach for the heavens you get the stars thrown in

Anything can happen if you let it life out there waiting

so go and get it grab it by the collar seize it by the scruff one

you've started living life you just can't get enough

Anything can happen it's official you can choose the super

or the superficial sally forth the way we're steering obstacles

start disappearing go and chase your dreams you won't regret it

Anything can happen anything can happen



Jane & Michael

Anything can happen



All

If you let it
