Mary Poppins:

When trying to express oneself, it's frankly quite absurd,

To leaf through lengthy lexicons to find the perfect word.

A little spontaneity keeps conversation keen,

You need to find a way to say, precisely what you mean...



Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!

Even though the sound of it is something quite atrocious!

If you say it loud enough, you'll always sound precocious,

Um-diddle-iddle-iddle-um-diddle-ay

Um-diddle-iddle-iddle-um-diddle-ay



Mary Poppins:

When Stone Age men were chatting, merely grunting would suffice.



Bert:

Now if they heard this word, they might have used it once or twice!



Mrs. Corry:

I'm sure Egyptian pharaohs would have grasped it in a jiff,

Then every single pyramid would bear this hieroglyph;



Oh!

Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!

Say it and wild animals would not seem so ferocious!



Mary Poppins:

Add some further flourishes, it's so ro-co-co-coscious!

Um-diddle-iddle-iddle-um-diddle-ay



Bert:

The Druids could have carved it on their mighty monoliths!



Mrs. Corry:

I'm certain the ancient Greeks would have used it in their midst!



Mary Poppins:

I'm sure the Roman Empire only entered the abyss,

Because those Latin scholars never had a word like this!



Ensemble:

Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!



Mary Poppins:

If you say it softly the effect can be hypnotious!



Bert:

Check your breath before you speak, in case it's halitocious!

Um-diddle-iddle-iddle-um-diddle-ay

Mary Poppins (spoken):

Of course you can say it backwards, which is Suoicodilaipxecitsiligarfilacrepus!



Michael (spoken):

She may be tricky, but she's bloody good!



Mary Poppins:

So when the cat has got your tongue, there's no need for dismay!

Just summon up this word and then you've got a lot to say!



Bert:

Pick out those eighteen consonants and sixteen vowels as well,

And put them in an order which is very hard to spell...



Mary Poppins:

Here we go!

Even though the sound of it is something quite atrocious!

If you say it loud enough, you'll always sound precocious,
