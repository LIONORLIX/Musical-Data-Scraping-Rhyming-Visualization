A Man Has Dreams / A Spoonful of Sugar (reprise)


George (spoken)

I used to dream that when I grew up I'd learn everything

there was to know about the stars.

It's funny, I haven't thought about all that in years.

I'm not usually sentimental.



Bert (spoken):

S' good to look back sometimes.



George: (spoken):

Is it? I'm not so sure



(sung):

A man has dreams of walking with giants

To carve his niche in the edifice of time

Before the mortar of his zeal

Has the chance to congeal



(spoken):

The cup is dashed from his lips

The flame is snuffed aborning

He's brought to rack and ruin in his prime



Bert (spoken):

Life's a rum go, Guv'nor, and that's the truth.



George (spoken):

Do you know what I think? It's Mary Poppins! From the moment

she stepped into this house, things began to happen to me!

Bert (spoken):

Mary Poppins eh?



George (spoken):

Yes, yes, of course!



(sung):

My world was calm, well ordered, exemplary

Then came this person, with chaos in her wake

And now my life's ambitions go in one fell blow

It's quite a bitter pill to take



(spoken):

It's that Poppins woman! She's responsible for all this!



Bert (spoken):

I know the very person. 'Ere, what's that thing she's always saying?



(sung):

A spoonful of sugar that is all it takes

It changes bread and water into tea and cakes



George (spoken):

There you see, that's exactly what I mean! Changing bread and water

into tea and cakes indeed! No wonder everything's coming unstrung

around here!



Bert:

A spoonful of sugar goes a long, long way

So, 'ave yourself a 'ealthy 'elpin' ev'ry day



George (spoken):

A healthy helping of trouble if you ask me!



Bert (spoken):

Like you say, Guv'nor.



(sung):

You've got to grind, grind, grind

At that grindstone

Though childhood slips like sand through a sieve

And all too soon they've up and grown

And then they've flown

And it's too late for you to give

Just that spoonful of sugar

To 'elp the medicine go down

The medicine go down, the medicine go down.



(spoken):

Well good luck, Guv'nor.



George (spoken):

Thank you, Bert. And good luck to you too.
