Good For Nothing / Being Mrs Banks (reprise)


George:

When you realize your worst fears have been realized

And certainties now seem a bit less sure

Ideals that at one time one idealized

Now don't seem so ideal any more.



Where once there was order

Chaos has been loosed

And home truths like chickens

Are coming home to roost.



Illusions may shatter but memories stay

The things that really matter I lost on the way

The sovereign, the master

And long may he reign

The famous good-for-nothing

Of cherry tree lane.



Winifred:

George, dear

I know it hurts your pride dear

But you can't just run and hide dear

Why can't you see that I'm here and I am on your side.



Whenever you spoke of Miss Andrew

You showered the woman with praise

But now that I've met dear Miss Andrew

There are one or two things I'd rephrase

To think you were raised by that monster

And carried that burden through life

If only you had seen that you could share it with your wife.



Being Mrs. Banks

It's easy to forget

The way I felt that summers' day

The day that we first met

Being Mrs. Banks

Being kissed by you

A man of dreams

Who made me feel

That wishes could come true.



And now although you're lost

It's time that we closed ranks

I'll fight for the man who needs freeing

The 'real you' who no-one is seeing

And you'll find a way of just being

Being Mister Banks.
