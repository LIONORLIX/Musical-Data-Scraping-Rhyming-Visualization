The Perfect Nanny


JANE

If you want this choice postition,

Have a cheery disposition.

Rosie cheeks, No warts,



MICHAEL

That's the part I put in.



JANE

Play games, all sorts

You must be kind, you must be witty.

Very sweet and fairly pretty



MR BANKS

Of all the ridiculous ideas



MRS BANKS

Oh George, please.



JANE

Take us on outings, give us treats



MICHAEL

Sing songs, bring sweets.

Never be cross or cruel,

Never feed us castor oil, or gruel.



JANE

Love us as a son and daughter,



MICHAEL

And never smell of barley water.

I put that part in too.



JANE

If you won't scold and dominate us,

We will never give you cause to hate us.

We wont hide your spectacles so you can't see.



MICHAEL

Put toads in your bed and pepper in your tea.



JANE

Hurry nanny, many thanks



BOTH

Sincerely,



JANE

Jane...



MICHAEL

and Michael



BOTH

Banks
