Cherry Tree Lane (Part 1)


Mrs Brill:

Katie Nanna!

And who gets stuck with the children with no nanny in the house?

Me! That's who!



Katie Nanna:

I've said my say, Mrs. Brill, and that's all I'll say,

I've done with this house forever!



Mrs. Brill:

Well good riddance, then!



Winifred:

Katie Nanna!

Gone? Are you quite sure...



Mrs. Brill:

Gone! And is it any wonder?



Winifred:

Choosing the right nanny - I keep drawing blanks

Do you really think I made another blunder

What on earth am I to say to Mr. Banks?

George, dear

I'm feeling so bereft dear,

Every nanny goes

We're unlucky I suppose.



Winifred, Mrs. Brill, Jane, Michael & Robertson Ay:

We are never going to find the perfect nanny



George:

Nonsense!

Precision and order

That's all that I ask

The running of a household

A straightforward task

The children, the servants,

They're all your domain

Whilst I remain the sovereign of Cherry tree lane.

Coat!



Mrs. Brill

Coming sir.



George:

The simple truth is you've engaged six nannies over the last four months,

and they've all been unqualified disasters!

A nanny should govern,

A nanny should rule

A nanny is a paragon who suffers no fool

A nanny's stalwart

Our children would gain

By having such a nanny in cherry tree lane.



Winifred:

Of course, George, but...



George:

So take control of situations

Show your authority when interviewing staff

You know your role, They know their stations,

Efficiency and forethought cut the jobs in half

Briefcase!



Winifred:

I thought Katie Nanna would be firm with the children.

She always looked so cross.



George:

Winifred, never confuse efficiency with a liver complaint.



Winifred:

Clear thinking

Sound judgment.



George:

That's how to advance



Winifred and George:

Then things will run like clockwork.



George:

Leave nothing to chance

When nannies go missing

The answer is plain

Our children must be monsters.



Winifred:

Oh how can they be monsters



Winifred and George:

in Cherry Tree Lane.



George:

Umbrella!



Winifred:

If only we could find someone like your old nanny.



George:

I'm afraid that's not realistic, my dear.

Few women alive could manage Miss Andrew's standards of efficiency.

Besides, we could never afford someone of her caliber.



Mrs. Brill and Robertson Ay:

Precision and order

He wants nothing less



Robertson Ay:

It's like an army barracks



Mrs. Brill:

Yes and we're in the mess



Mrs. Brill and Robertson Ay:

No wonder the Nannies are driven insane

We're living in a madhouse in Cherry Tree Lane.



George:

Now place an advertisement in the Times stating that Jane and Michael Banks

require the best possible nanny at the lowest possible wage.



Jane:

Father, we've written our own advertisement.



George:

What!



Winifred:

Please, George. I think we should hear it.



Jane:

Wanted. A nanny. For two adorable children.



George:

Adorable? Well, that's debatable, I must say.
