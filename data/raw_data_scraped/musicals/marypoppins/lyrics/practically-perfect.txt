Practically Perfect


MARY POPPINS

By the time the wind has blown the weather vane around,

I'll show you if I can,

No matter what the circumstance for one thing I'm renowned,

My character is spit spot spic and span,

I'm practically perfect in every way,



JANE

Practically Perfect?



MARY POPPINS

So people say,

Each virtue virtually knows no bound,

Each trait is great and patently sound,

I'm practically perfect from head to toe,

If I had a fault it would never dare to show,

I'm so practically perfect in every way,



Both prim and proper and never to stern,

Well educated yet willing to learn,

I'm clean and honest my manner refined,

And I wear shoes of the sensible kind,

I suffer no nonsense and whilst I remain,

There's nothing else I feel I need explain,



I'm practically perfect in every way,

Practically perfect that's my forte,

Uncanny nannies are hard to find,

Unique yet meek unspeakably kind,

I'm practically perfect not slightly soiled,

Running like an engine, thats just been freshly oiled,

I'm so practically perfect in every way,

Well those are my credentals,

Perhaps you have a few questions?



MICHAEL

Not Tempremental?



MARY POPPINS

Never



MICHAEL

Not Grouchy or Gruff?



MARY POPPINS

Oh, the very thought,



JANE

Will you stay tender when the going gets tough?



MARY POPPINS

Quite the contrary,



MICHAEL

Do you read stories without a big fuss?



MARY POPPINS

Umm Hmm,



JANE

Or have objections to playing with us?



MARY POPPINS

Oh, I like games, but I choose them,

Some minor improvements may not go a miss,

But at all times you must remember this,



JANE AND MICHAEL

You're practically perfect in every way,



MARY POPPINS

I guarantee,



JANE AND MICHAEL

Practically perfect we hope you'll stay,



MARY POPPINS

No Flies on me,

Each virtue virtually knows no bound,

Each trait is great,



JANE AND MICHAEL

And patently sound,



MARY POPPINS

Patently sound,

Spit spot,

La da da dee,

La da da daa,

La da da daa,

Da da da daa,

Da da da da da daa,

Jane, put your toys away please,



JANE

Do I have to?



MARY POPPINS

Yes,

Michael tidy your things,



MICHAEL

It's not fair!



MARY POPPINS

I didn't say I was fair, I said,

I'm practically perfect and here's my aim,

By the time I leave here you both will be the same,

You'll be practically perfect,



JANE AND MICHAEL

Practically perfect,



ALL

You/we will be practically perfect in every way.
