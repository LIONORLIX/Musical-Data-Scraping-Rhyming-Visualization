Chim Chim Cher-ee


Bert:

Winds in the east,

There's a mist comin' in.

Like somethin' is brewin',

And 'bout to begin.

Can't put me finger on what lies in store.

But I feel,

What's to 'appen,

All 'appened before.



A father, a mother, a daughter, a son.

The threads of their lifes are all ravelin' undone.

Something is needed,

To twist them as tight,

As the string, you might hold,

When you're flyin' your kite.

Chim chiminee chim chim, cher-ee chim cher-oo
