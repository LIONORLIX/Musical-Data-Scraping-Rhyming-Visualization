Feed The Birds


Bird Woman:

Feed the birds, tuppence a bag

Tuppence, tuppence, tuppence a bag

Feed the birds," tuppence a bag

Tuppence, tuppence, tuppence a bag



Mary Poppins:

Early each day to the steps of Saint Paul's

The little old bird woman comes

In her own special way to the people she call,



Bird Woman:

Come, buy my bags full of crumbs

Come feed the little birds,

Show them you care

And you'll be glad if you do

Their young ones are hungry

Their nests are so bare

All it takes is tuppence from you

Feed the birds, tuppence a bag

Tuppence, tuppence, tuppence a bag



Mary Poppins:

"Feed the birds," that's what she cries

While overhead, her birds fill the skies



(Chorus sings sections of melody on an "ah")



Mary:

All around the cathedral the saints and apostles

Look down as she sells her wares

Although you can't see it,

You know they are smiling

Each time someone shows that he cares



Though her words are simple and few

Listen, listen, she's calling to you



Bird Woman:

Feed the birds, tuppence a bag



Both:

Tuppence, tuppence, tuppence a bag



Bird Woman:

Tuppence,

(Spoken)

tuppence,

(Sung)

tuppence a bag
