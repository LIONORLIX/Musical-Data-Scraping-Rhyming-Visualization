Hot Stuff


Sittin' here, eatin' my heart out waitin'

Waitin' for some lover to call

Dialed about a thousand numbers lately

Almost rang the phone off the wall



Lookin' for some hot stuff baby this evenin'

I need some hot stuff baby tonight

I want some hot stuff baby this evenin'

Gotta have some hot stuff

Gotta have some lovin' tonight

I need hot stuff

I want some hot stuff

I need hot stuff



Lookin' for a lover who needs another

Don't want another night on my own

Wanna share my love with a warm blooded lover

Wanna bring a wild man back home



Gotta have some hot love baby this evenin'

I need some hot stuff baby tonight

I want some hot stuff baby this evenin'

Gotta have some lovin'

Got to have a love tonight

I need hot stuff

Hot love

Lookin' for hot love



Hot, hot, hot, hot stuff

Hot, hot, hot

Hot, hot, hot, hot stuff

Hot, hot, hot



How's that hot stuff baby this evenin'

I need some hot stuff baby tonight

Gimme little hot stuff baby this evenin'

Hot stuff baby got to I need your love tonight

I need hot stuff

Lookin' for hot stuff

Gotta have some hot stuff



Sittin' here eatin' my heart out no reason

Won't spend another night on my own

I dialed about hundred numbers baby

I'm bound to find somebody home



Gotta have some hot stuff baby this evenin'

I need some hot stuff baby tonight

Lookin' for some hot stuff baby this evenin'

I need your love baby

Don't need your love tonight



Hot stuff

Baby this evening

I need hot stuff baby tonight

Yes, yes, I want some hot stuff baby this evenin'

I want some hot stuff baby tonight

Yes, yes, yes now hot stuff baby

I need your hot stuff baby tonight

I want some hot stuff baby this evenin'

Hot stuff baby

Got to I need your love tonight
