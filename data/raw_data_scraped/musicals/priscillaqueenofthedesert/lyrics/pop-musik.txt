Pop Musik


Get up...

Get down...



Radio, video

Boogie with a suitcase

Your livin' in a disco

Forget about the rat race

Let's do the milkshake, sellin' like a hotcake

Try some buy some fee-fi-fo-fum



Talk about, pop musik

Talk about, pop musik



Shoobie doobie do wop

I wanna dedicate this

Pop pop shoo wop

Everybody made it

Shoobie doobie do wop

Infiltrate it

Pop pop shoo wop

Activate it



New York, London, Paris, Munich

Everybody talk about pop musik

Talk about, pop musik

Talk about, pop musik

Pop pop pop pop musik



Singing in the subway

Shuffle with a shoe shine

Fix me a molotov

I'm on the headline



Wanna be a gun slinger

Don't be a rock singer

Eenie meenie mynie moe

Tell me where you wanna go



Talk about, pop musik

Talk about, pop musik



Shoobie doobie do wop

Lyin' in the tree (?)

Pop pop shoo wop

Eenee meenie

Shoobie doobie do wop



Pop pop shoo wop

You know what I mean



Hit it...



Now you know what to say...



Talk about, pop musik

Pop pop pop pop musik



All around the world

wherever you are

dance in the street anything you like

do it in your car in the middle of the night

La la la la la la la la la

La la la la la la la



Dance in the supermart

Dig it in the fastlane

Listen to the countdown

They're playin' our song again



I can't get jumping jack

I wanna hold - get back

Moonlight muzak

Knick knack patty whack



Talk about, pop musik

Talk about, pop musik



Shoobie doobie do wop

It's all around you

Pop pop shoo wop

Gonna suround you

Shoobie doobie do wop

It's all around
