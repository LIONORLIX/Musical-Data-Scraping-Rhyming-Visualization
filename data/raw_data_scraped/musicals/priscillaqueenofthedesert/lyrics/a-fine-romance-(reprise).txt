A Fine Romance (Reprise)


A fine romance with no kisses

A fine romance, my friend this is

We should be like

A couple of hot tomatoes

But you're as cold

As yesterday's mashed potatoes



A fine romance with no clinches

A fine romance with no flinches

I've never mussed the crease

In your blue serge pants

I never get the chance

This is a fine romance



A fine romance, my good fellow

You take romance, I'll take jello

You're just as hard to land as the Ille de France

I haven't got a chance

My heart's not made of plastic

You're the reason I'm sarcastic

'Cause this is a fine, fine romance
