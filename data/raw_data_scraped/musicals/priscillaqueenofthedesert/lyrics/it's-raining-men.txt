It's Raining Men


Humidity is rising

Barometer's getting low

According to our sources

The street's the place to go



Cause' tonight for the first time

Just about half past ten

For the first time in history

It's gonna start raining men



It's raining men

Hallejulah

It's raining men

Amen



It's raining men

Hallejulah

It's raining men

Amen

Tall blonde dark and lean

Rough and tough and strong and mean



God bless Mother Nature

She's a single woman too

She took over heaven

And she did what she had to do



She fought every Angel

To rearranged the sky

So that each and every woman

Could find the perfect guy

Don't get yourself Weather Girls

I feel stormy wheather moving in

About to begin

Hear the thunder

Don't you loose your head

Rip off the roof and stay in bed

(Rip off the roof and stay)
