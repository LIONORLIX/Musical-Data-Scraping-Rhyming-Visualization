Colour My World


You'll never see a dark cloud hanging round me.

Now there is only blue skies to surround me.

There's never been a gray day since you found me.

Everything I touch is turning to gold.



Oh, you can colour my world with sunshine yellow each day!

Oh, you can colour my world with happiness all the way!

Just take the green from the grass and the blue from the sky up above!

And if you colour my world just paint it with your love!

Just colour my world.



Just as long as I know you're thinking of me,

there'll be a rainbow always up above me.

Since I found the one who really loves me,

everything I touch is turning to gold.



So you can colour my world with sunshine yellow each day!

Oh, you can colour my world with happiness all the way!

Just take the green from the grass and the blue from the sky up above!

And if you colour my world just paint it with your love!

Just colour my world.

Um.



Sunshine yellow.

Orange blossums.

Laughing faces

everywhere!

Yeah!



Oh, you can colour my world with sunshine yellow each day!

Oh, you can colour my world with happiness all the way!

Just take the green from the grass and the blue from the sky up above!

And if you colour my world just paint it with your love.

Just colour my world.

Colour my world.

Oh, colour my world.

Colour my world!
