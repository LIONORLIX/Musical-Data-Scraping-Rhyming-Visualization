Shake Your Groove Thing


Keep dancin', let's keep dancin'



Shake it, shake it

Shake it, shake it



Groovin' loose or heart to heart

We put in motion every single part

Funky sounds wall to wall

We're bumpin' booties, havin' us a ball, y'all



Shake your groove thing, shake your groove thing, yeah, yeah

Show 'em how we do it now

Shake your groove thing, shake your groove thing, yeah, yeah



Show 'em how we do it now, yeah

Shake it

Show 'em how we do it now, yeah

Shake it, shake it



Shake it

Doo, doo, doo, whoa

Shake it

Doo, doo, doo, whoa



Shake your groove thing

Shake your groove thing



Show 'em how we do it now, let's get on down

Show 'em how we do it now, show 'em how we do it now, ooh

Ooh

Show 'em how we do it now, shake your groove thing



Shake it, shake it

Shake it, shake it, a bumpin' booty, now

Shake it, shake it

Shake it, shake it, a little freaky now

Shake it, shake it

A shake it, shake it, a do it to it y'all
