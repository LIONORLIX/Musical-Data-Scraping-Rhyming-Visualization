Another Miracle of Judaism


JASON

Hello, God

I don't think we've ever really spoken

If you'd kindly allow

How about a miracle now?



I don't know if you exist

I can't hear your fingers snappin'

Are you just a big psychiatrist?

Or, can you make things not happen?

Do this for me

And I'll get bar mitzvahed

In exchange for

Could you please make my friend stop dying?

I am not naive

It won't be easy

But if you could make my friend stop dying

God

That'd be the miracle of Judaism

That'd be the miracle of Judaism
