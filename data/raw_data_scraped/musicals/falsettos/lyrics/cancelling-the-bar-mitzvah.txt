Cancelling the Bar Mitzvah


TRINA

Jason, if you want a Bar Mitzvah

God knows, you can have a Bar Mitzvah

But I have to know

And I have to know now

Just what it is you want

I've addressed the invitations

Here's your chance to give me Hell

If you think it's bust

Then it's probably just

As well



JASON

Can't we wait 'til Whizzer gets better?

Can't we wait 'til he's out?

That's what bar mitzvahs should be all about!

Good friends close at hand -

Don't you understand?



MENDEL

We can't be sure when

He'll get better

When, or if

He'll ever get better

But the hall is booked

And the band's been retained

So, Jason, please

What we'll do is your decision

There's no right and there's no wrong

Just say yes or no

And we'll promise to go along



JASON

Finally, now, it's all my decision

Like it's my bar mitzvah

Just like nothing happened

Hell, let's have a party

Just like nothing happened

Why don't you make this dumb decision yourselves

Okay?

Why don't you make this dumb decision yourselves?



MENDEL

We'll have the bar mitzvah?



JASON

No



TRINA

So, we'll cancel the bar mitzvah?



JASON

No!



TRINA AND MENDEL

We'll wait until you've made a decision



TRINA

Now what do we do?



MENDEL

Why don't we tell him

That we don't have the answers?

And that life can be grim

Life's not all about him

And things rarely go according to plan

Tell him things happen

For no damned good reason

That his lack of control

Kills what's best in your soul

And this is the start

To his becoming a man



TRINA

Holding to the ground

As the ground keeps shifting



MENDEL

Trying to keep sane

As the rules keep changing



TRINA AND MENDEL

Keeping up my head

As my heart falls out of sight

Everything will be alright
