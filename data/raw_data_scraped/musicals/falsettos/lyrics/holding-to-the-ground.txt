Holding to the Ground


TRINA

I was sure growing up I would live the life

My mother assumed I'd live

Very Jewish, very middle-class, and very straight

Where healthy men stayed healthy men

And marriages were long and great

I smile

I don't complain



I'm trying to keep sane as the rules keep changing

Families aren't what they were

Thank God there's a husband and a child whom I adore

But then there's more

So many more

There's always more



Life is never what you planned

Life is moments you can't understand

And that is life

I'm plain

I don't astound



I hold to the ground

As the ground keeps shifting

Keeping my balance square

Trying not to care about this man who Marvin loves

But that's my life

He shared my life

Yes, that's my life



Life is never what you planned

Life is moments you can't understand

And that is life



Holding to the ground

As the ground keeps shifting

Trying to keep sane

As the rules keep changing

Keeping up my head

As my heart falls out of sight

Everything will be all right

Everything will be all right
