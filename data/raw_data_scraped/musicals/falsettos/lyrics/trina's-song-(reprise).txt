Trina's Song (Reprise)


TRINA

Please forgive my former shpieling–

It does not concern the man

As for doubts that I've been feeling

I'll ignore them when I can

And the things that I must do

I'll do to make this all succeed

I'll commit, that's agreed

And with wit and precision

I've made a decision

To get the things I need

God, I'll try, I'll try, I'll cry



No, I'll laugh – then unafraid

I'll laugh - and hire a maid

I'll fight the gods. I'll fight my ex

I'll beat the odds. I'll have good sex

My future's now on trial

I smile
