I Never Wanted to Love You


TRINA:

I never wanted to love you.

I only wanted to love and not be blamed.

Let me go, you should know

I'm not ashamed

To have loved you.



MENDEL:

I loved you more than I meant to.

In my profession, one's love stays unexpressed.

Here we stand, take my hand.

God, I'm distressed.

How I love you.



JASON: I hate the world!



TRINA: He hates everything!



JASON: I love my dad!



MENDEL: He loves his father.



JASON: I love the things I've never had.



TRINA & MENDEL: Love our family.



JASON: Lord, hear our call!



MENDEL: (overlapping) Help us all.



TRINA: Help us all.



JASON: Helps us all.



MENDEL: Help us all.



TRINA, MENDEL, & JASON: Help us all!



WHIZZER:

I never wanted to love you.

I never wanted, 'till death do we two part.'

Condescend, stay my friend.

How do I start,

Not to love you'



TRINA:

I'm everything he wanted.

It's time I put it all together.

My hands were tied.

My father cried,

'You'll marry!'

I married!



TRINA & JASON: (overlapping) He's mine! He's mine!



MARVIN:

I never wanted to love you.

I only wanted to see my face in yours.

Jason smiled, save this child.

How he adores, and hates me-



It really killed me when you took those vows.

Don't misunderstand, I'm in command!

Anyhow, we're through!

I never wanted,

I wanted-

I never, never, never, never,

Never, never wanted to love you!

I never wanted to love you!

I never wanted to love you!

I never wanted to love you!



ALL: (overlapping) Love you!
