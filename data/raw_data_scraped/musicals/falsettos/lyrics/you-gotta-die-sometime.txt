You Gotta Die Sometime


Okay, when the doctor started using phrases like "You'll pass away".

What could i say? I said,

"Doctor, in plain english tell me why was I chosen why me of al men,

docter here's the good part at least death means

I'll never be scared about dying again.



Lets get on with living while we can

And not play dunb deaths gonna come

And when it does screw the nerves I'll be eating hors'deavres

It's the roll of the dice and no crime, you gotta die sometime.



Death is not a friend but I hope in the end he takes me in his arms

And lets me hold his face,

He takes me in his arms and whispers something funny,

He lifts me in his arms and tells me to embrace his attack.



Then the scene goes to black. Life sucks people always hate a loser

And they hate lame ducks screw me and shucks thats it thats the ball game

I don't smoke don't do drugs and then comes the bad news.



I quit thats the ball game

It's the chink in the armor the shit in the karma the blues.

Can I keep my cool despite the urge to fall apart how should

I start i would cry is I could but it does no damn good to explain

I'm a man in my prime. You gotta die sometime.



Deaths a funny pal with a weird sort of talent

He puts his arms around my neck and walks me to the bed.

He pins me up against the wall and kisses me like crazy the many stupid things

I thought about with dread now delight then the scne goes to white.



Give me the balls to orchestrate a gracful

Leave thats my reprieve to go out without care my head high

In the air it's the last little mountain i'll climb,

I'll climb you gotta die sometime,

You gotta die sometime you gotta die sometime you gotta die sometime,

Sometime, sometime, sometime.

Somtime, sometime, sometime, sometime.
