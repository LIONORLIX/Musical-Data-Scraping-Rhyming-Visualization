A Marriage Proposal


JASON: (speaking) This is how you make a marriage proposal.



MENDEL: (singing)

I love you dear.

I think you're swell.

You're never near me close enough to tell

If I'm delightful or not.



I need your wrist.

I praise your thigh.

There's not a guy,

There's not a piece of paper,

There's not a man in pants

Who could love you the same as I!



Oftentimes, lovers are crazy people.

Sometimes they kill each other.

Just like a biblical brother

Did to his biblical brother

Back in biblical times.



TRINA: Biblical times?



MARVIN: (speaking) Biblical times?



MENDEL: Uh, biblical times. (singing) Oh, those' biblical times!



I love your eyes.

I love your face.

I want you by my side to take my place

If I get sick or detained.



Don't brush your hair, you?re perfect.

Don't start to cry.

There's not a guy,

There's not a horse or zebra,

There's not a giant man

Who could love you the same as I!



Forget that giant man,

He won't love you the same as I!

I'm not a giant man,

But I'll love you until,

Love you until,

I die!
