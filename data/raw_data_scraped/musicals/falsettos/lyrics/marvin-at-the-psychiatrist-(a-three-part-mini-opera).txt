Marvin at the Psychiatrist (A Three-Part Mini-Opera)


JASON: My father says that love

Is the most beautiful thing in the world.

I think games are,

I think chess is the most

Beautiful thing,

Not love.



WHIZZER: (speaking) Marvin at the Psychiatrist, a three-part mini opera. Part One.



MENDEL: (singing) Do you love him'



MARVIN: Sorta kinda.



MENDEL: Do you need him'



MARVIN: Sorta kinda.

He makes me smile a lot,

Especially at mealtime.

It makes me feel I'm sort of smart.



MENDEL: Mm-hmm. Is he special'



MARVIN: He's delightful.



MENDEL: And romantic'



MARVIN: Yes, but spiteful. And yet it seems that so am I.



MENDEL: Just enjoy what you can.

Love the boy, not the man.



MARVIN: Man' sorta stylish.



MENDEL: Kinda very'



MARVIN: (speaking) Mmm, very very sorta.



MENDEL: (singing) And kind of hard to describe'



MARVIN: (speaking) Yes, you know, I think that's true.



MENDEL: When he's naked,-



MARVIN: Yes'



MENDEL: Does he thrill you'



MARVIN: Yes!



MENDEL: Is he vicious'



MARVIN: Yes!



MENDEL: Would he kill you'



MARVIN: (thinks) Yes. I think he's sorta kinda mean.

But I love him, and I need it.

If he loved me, I'd concede it.



MENDEL: Don't despise what you feel.

Love the friend, not the heel.



MARVIN: Heel'



MENDEL: He's sometimes worthless'



MARVIN: Sometimes evil.



MENDEL: Sometimes smarmy'



WHIZZER: (speaking) Part Two.



MENDEL: (singing) It's queer, Mr. Marvin- sorry.



MARVIN: Jesus'



MENDEL: Strange, Mr. Marvin,

How your wife- your ex-wife's meager glories

Coupled with her tragic stories,

Moves me in unreported ways.



MARVIN: She's a very good woman.

She's a wonderful woman.



MENDEL: Do you mind that'

She was here to speak of Jason, and I find that

I hope Jason acts out more,

Cause there's a few more things we need explore.



MARVIN: (speaking) No, I understand.



MENDEL: Good! Very good. Very, very good!

I feel a lot better already.

Going on' (singing) Was she a vicious woman'



MARVIN: No.



MENDEL: Did she beat the child'



MARVIN: No!



MENDEL: Did she ever drive you wild'



MARVIN: No.



MENDEL: Never'



MARVIN: No.



MENDEL: Never'



MARVIN: No.



MENDEL: Never-never-never-never'



MARVIN: No.



MENDEL: Never'



MARVIN: No.



MENDEL: Never'



MARVIN: No, no, no!



MENDEL: Was she faithful' be objective.



MARVIN: Well, yes.



MENDEL: She was faithful!



MARVIN: Yes.



MENDEL: And her last caress was:



MARVIN: Careless.



MENDEL: You mean, 'careful'.



MARVIN: Careful, not to show she cared.



MENDEL: So you weren't prepared

For the crying,

And the screaming.



MARVIN: And the beating of the breast!

(speaking) I don't want to be rude.



MENDEL: (singing) Does she sleep in the nude'



MARVIN: ...No. Going on.



MENDEL: Did you like that'

Would she change it if she knew you didn't like that'

Did she wear a negligee'

Could you blow and it would blow away'

I don't mean to interfere.

I would like to make that very clear.



WHIZZER: (speaking) Part Three.



MARVIN: (singing) My son's distressing.



JASON: My father's snide.



MARVIN: I'm convalescing.



JASON: He's morbid and dissatisfied.



MARVIN: What should I do now'



JASON: He loves another.



MARVIN: I agree.



JASON: I love my mother.



MARVIN: Why not me' we go to ball games.



JASON: The ball is tossed.



MARVIN: The pitcher's handsome.



JASON: And our team lost.



MARVIN: Is that my problem' should I be blamed for that'



JASON: Explore museums.



MARVIN: Admire art.



JASON: We stand together.



MARVIN: But we stand there looking miles apart.

How do I reach him'

What words of wisdom'

What should I do now'



JASON: My father says that love

Is the most beautiful thing in the world.

I think games are,

I think chess is the most

Beautiful thing,

Not love.



MENDEL: (speaking) Marvin at the Psychiatrist, a three-part mini opera.

The End.
