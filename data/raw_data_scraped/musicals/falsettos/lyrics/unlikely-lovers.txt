Unlikely Lovers


MARVIN: Who'd believe that we two

Would end up as lovers?



WHIZZER:

Do you want me to reply?

MARVIN

Him and me, you and I

Passionately lovers



WHIZZER: Please don't get morbid



MARVIN: Right



WHIZZER: It's just-



MARVIN: Don't fight



WHIZZER: That I haven't died yet



MARVIN: Just stop it



WHIZZER: I'm sick, but kicking



MARVIN: Geez



WHIZZER: Alright



MARVIN: Louise



WHIZZER: Good night



MARVIN:

I'm staying here in this spot

Whether you want me to or not

I'm staying

Here I am, by your side

One old horny lover



WHIZZER: Please go home and don't be scared



MARVIN:

What's the fuss? I'm not scared

What good is a lover who's scared?

Hit me if you need to

Slap my face or hold me till winter

Oh, baby, please do

I love you too

My lover



WHIZZER:

Marvin, just go home and turn on TV

Drink a little something till you're 'dead'

Think of me around

Sleeping soundly in our bed

Marvin, did you hear what I said?



MARVIN:

Shut your mouth, go to sleep

Time I met a sailor

Are you sleeping yet or...?

What is what? Whizzer, but

I can't help but feeling I've failed

Let's be scared together

Let's pretend that nothing is awful



WHIZZER: There's nothing to fear



MARVIN: There's nothing to fear'



WHIZZER: Just stay right here



MARVIN AND WHIZZER: I love you



(Dr. Charlotte and Cordelia enter)



CHARLOTTE: Shhh. Maybe he's tired



CORDELIA: Shhh. Maybe he's waiting for us



CHARLOTTE: Shhh. Maybe he's waiting for a visit



CHARLOTTE AND CORDELIA:

Is it a bad time? We'll come back

If it's a bad time, we'll come back

We'll come in



MARVIN: Look at us, four old friends

Four unlikely lovers



CORDELIA: We don't know what time will bring



WHIZZER: I've a clue



MARVIN: I have too



CHARLOTTE AND CORDELIA: Let's look like we haven't



MARVIN, CHARLOTTE, AND CORDELIA: And each say nothing



WHIZZER: Sky!



CHARLOTTE: It's blue!



MARVIN: I love the sky!



CORDELIA: I love the trees!



MARVIN: I love bad weather!



CHARLOTTE: I love the earth beneath my feet!



WHIZZER: I love friends that hover!



MARVIN, WHIZZER, CHARLOTTE, AND CORDELIA:

Gee, we love to eat

And we need something sweet

To love!



What a group we four are

Four unlikely lovers

And we vow that we will

Buy the farm, arm in arm

Four unlikely lovers with heart

Let's be scared together

Let's pretend that nothing is awful



WHIZZER, CHARLOTTE, AND CORDELIA: There's nothing to fear



MARVIN: There's nothing to fear



WHIZZER, CHARLOTTE, AND CORDELIA:

Just stay right here

I love you. (Whizzer to Marvin, Charlotte to Cordelia)



MARVIN: I love you. (to Whizzer)



WHIZZER, CHARLOTTE, AND CORDELIA: I love you. (Charlotte/Cordelia to Marvin/Whizzer)



MARVIN: I love you (to Charlotte, Cordelia, and Whizzer)
