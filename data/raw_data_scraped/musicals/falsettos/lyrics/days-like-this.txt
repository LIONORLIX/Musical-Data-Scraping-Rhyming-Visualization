Days Like This


MARVIN: Whizzer, kid, you're looking very good today.

You had to see yourself a few days back,

I had a heart attack!

Jesus'

But today you seem to be

On the way to recovery!

Oh, Whizzer, I want to applaud!

It's days like this I almost believe in God,

Days like this I almost believe

In God.



WHIZZER: (speaking) Hello!



CORDELIA: Hello!



WHIZZER: (laughs) Hey.



CORDELIA: (singing)

Rugelach! Gefilte fish!

It's so good, you'd think it's Italian!

Also a soup made from chicken

That, though un-exotic, is antibiotic!

Why, I'm up to my ass

In a kosher morass!

For aches and croup,

Try my chicken soup!



MARVIN: Whizzer, kid, you're looking very good today.

You had to see yourself a few days back,

CORDELIA: (overlapping)

So let's begin. It's medicine!

It could be we're both going to cure you,

Me with my soup,

She with her medication.

Such elation!



MARVIN & CORDELIA: But today you seem to be

On the way to recovery!

Oh, Whizzer, I want to applaud!

It's days like this we almost believe in God,

Days like this we almost believe

MARVIN: (overlapping) God!



TRINA: He had trouble parking, just like on our second date.



MENDEL: I hyperventilate.

But since I'm parking in the city, I've improved,

Or else the hydrants moved! (Trina laughs)

Yeah, go ahead, be good and pissed.

'How can I help'', says the wiry psychiatrist!



TRINA: He'll make you well!



MENDEL: I'll make you well!



WHIZZER: (speaking) Haha, right.



CHARLOTTE & JASON: (singing) Whizzer, hello!



JASON: Gee, you look awful. I think you need to play some chess.



WHIZZER: Jason, sit down and begin.



JASON: I'll let you win, Whizzer. I'll let you win. I'll let you win.



MARVIN & CHARLOTTE: Whizzer, kid, you're looking very good today.
