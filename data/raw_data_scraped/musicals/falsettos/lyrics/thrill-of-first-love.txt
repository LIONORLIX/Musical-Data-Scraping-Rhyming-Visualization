Thrill of First Love


WHIZZER: Pick up all your clothes



MARVIN: Whizzer begs



WHIZZER: Whizzer knows



MARVIN: Shave your legs



WHIZZER: Make me sick



MARVIN: You're a prick



WHIZZER: God you're impossible

We've been together for nine months



MARVIN: Uh' ten months



WHIZZER: Nine Months



MARVIN: Ten Months



WHIZZER: Nine months



MARVIN: Ten months

We are the salt of the bourgeoisie



WHIZZER: While I put the steak in?



MARVIN: I bring home the bacon



BOTH: And we're proud to say we love it how we



MARVIN/ WHIZZER: Don't/ Won't



MARVIN; Don't



WHIZZER: Won't



BOTH: Agree



WHIZZER: Everything he owns is vile

Marvin doesn't care

A whit

Marvin doesn't share

My devotion to

Style

Men from France can cancel a debt

Men in cufflinks make me forget my name

I intend to upset

This regrettable game



MARVIN: Whizzer takes me by the neck



WHIZZER: Isn't that a French lapel?



MARVIN: Whizzer has unlimited knowledge of Dreck



WHIZZER: Send me flowers



MARVIN: Mention is made?



WHIZZER: Make them roses



MARVIN: Attention is paid in full



WHIZZER: See how quickly he sours



MARVIN: When he pushes, I pull



WHIZZER: Pick up your clothes, Marvin breeding shows Marvin



MARVIN: I was rich

He was horny



WHIZZER: We fit like a glove



MARVIN: Close your eyes, Whizzer



WHIZZER: Passion dies

But I'd kill for that thrill of first love



BOTH: We ask for passion at all times

We stand for passion and drink this toast



WHIZZER: Still it's awfully trying?



MARVIN: And we're not denying?



BOTH: That of all the lesser passions

We like fighting most



MARVIN: Whizzer drinks too much to see

What a joy is chastity

What a joy is saving his joys

For one man



WHIZZER: Leave me



MARVIN: Love me



WHIZZER: Don't be a fool



MARVIN: Want me



WHIZZER: Feed me



MARVIN: No one's so cruel and cheap



WHIZZER: What I love I devour



MARVIN: What you love you devour? What I covet I keep



Isn't that right, Whizzer?

Let's both fight, Whizzer!



WHIZZER: I was trained in karate



MARVIN: I'm best when I cheat

So I'll cheat, Whizzer, and I'll shove

And I'll kill for that thrill of first love



WHIZZER: We've been together for nine months-



MARVIN: Ten months



WHIZZER: Nine months



MARVIN: We've been together for ten months



WHIZZER: Nine months



MARVIN: Ten months

In fact we've almost survived a year



WHIZZER: True, but



BOTH: Who is counting?

We're too busy mounting

A display of our affection

That is so sincere



(30 measure interlude)



BOTH: Passion dies



MARVIN: Passion dies



WHIZZER: I would kill for that thrill of first love



MARVIN: I would kill for that thrill



WHIZZER: I would kill for that thrill of first love-



MARVIN: Of first love- I would kill for that thrill



WHIZZER: I would kill for that thrill of first



MARVIN: I would kill for that thrill of first



BOTH: Love, love, lo-ve!
