Everyone Tells Jason to See a Psychiatrist


TRINA:

Darling, please see a psychiatrist.

He doesn't bite, and he might

Help you understand

Why you are so angry and despised

By all those guys

Who have not been, they have not been analyzed.



Yet, sweetheart, please do not get hysterical.

Reason will win the day, trust me!

Mother never lies.

No one is saying you're a sick neurotic,

But you could find some help.

Hear me out, please.

Yes, you could find some help,

He could help you realize



How confused you are!

Yes, it's very clear.

Daddy's sincere, but a schmo!

You and I must trust our emotions,

Make no commotions.

Will you go'



JASON: No!



MARVIN:

Jason, please see a psychiatrist.

He's just a psychiatrist.

I'll pay the bill until you're old.



(Marvin repeats his verse, overlapping with the next two verses)



TRINA: (overlapping) Darling, please listen to your father.

(I can't transcribe the rest of this by ear)



JASON: (overlapping)

No, I won't go!

I will not go!

Never, never, never, never,

Never, never, never, never-



TRINA & MARVIN: What a mess this is, this family! Experts can see this is so!



TRINA, MARVIN, and JASON: Photographs can't capture our magic,

We're simply tragic!



TRINA and MARVIN: Will you go'



JASON: No!



TRINA and MARVIN: Jason, please see a psychiatrist! He's not-



JASON: I won't say boo!



TRINA and MARVIN: Exorbitant, and he's very smart!



JASON: If intelligence were the only criterion,

Then I wouldn't really need a psychiatrist, would I'



TRINA: No.



JASON: Would I'



MARVIN: No.



JASON: Just because you failed as parents'

JASON: With Whizzer.



MARVIN: (speaking) Oh my god.



TRINA, MARVIN, and JASON: (singing) Whizzer! Whizzer! Whizzer! Whizzer!



JASON: Whizzer, do you think I should see a psychiatrist'



WHIZZER: I'm not sure, Jason. Jason, maybe so. Absolutely, Jason.
