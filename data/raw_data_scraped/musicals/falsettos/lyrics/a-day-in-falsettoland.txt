A Day in Falsettoland


WHIZZER: (speaking) A Day In Falsettoland, Dr. Mendel At Work.



CAROLINE: You go out on the streets,

And there are all these people asking for a handout!

You go home, you open up your mail,

And it's full of people asking for a donation!

And you turn on the TV and they want money for starving children in Ethiopia!

I just want to be left alone!



MENDEL: (overlapping) (singing)

I don't get it! I don't understand!

In the 60s, everyone had heart.

In the 60s, we were all a part of the same team.

In the 60s, we had a new world to start!

Could this- oh God, don't say this-

Could this be the new world we started'

Here I sit, brokenhearted and-



CAROLINE: (speaking) Do I wait for the promotion, or do I take this IBM job'



MENDEL: Yeah, well, Caroline' Hmm.

(singing) I don't get it!

I've been left behind,

Half my patients, yuppie pagans

Modeled on the Ronald Reagans!

Now the world is too pathetic,

And I don't get it at all!



CAROLINE: (speaking) Oh, I'm in a deep quandary about my career. What do you think I should do'



MENDEL: Time's up.



CAROLINE: Awww.



MENDEL: (singing) At least there's Trina at home,

Trina in bed, Trina obsessing and sort of caressing

My head with her feet.

I once thought it was sweet,

But I don't anymore.

Now I just snore,



Cause I'm so exhausted,

Listening as those yuppie farts complain,

Listening as their shallow hearts explain

Their lives.



CHARLOTTE: (speaking) Trina Works It Out.



TRINA: (singing) Marvin's back with Whizzer,

Just like how it was.

If I don't like Whizzer,

It's because my ex sure does.



Why should that affect me'

Sometimes I'm a lout.

Mendel serenades and Jason calms me.

Why should I be wilting

When their precious love is not in doubt'

Work it out!



JASON: The Neighbors Relax!



CORDELIA: How was your day at the hospital'



CHARLOTTE: Unbelieveable! What is that smell'



CORDELIA: Nouvelle bar mitzvah cuisine! I've been practicing cuisine bar mitzvah nouvelle. Well'



MENDEL: (speaking) Hi, honey.



TRINA: Hi, honey.



MENDEL: (singing) How was your day'



TRINA: It was terrible. Did you hear that Marvin's back with Whizzer' Marvin's back with Whizzer!



MENDEL: Drop it, sweetheart.

Give it up, you know I love you.

Honey, sweetheart, what's the matter'

I don't get it. Why don't you let go'



TRINA: After the first mile, I'll be OK. I cannot let go until we have this bar mitzvah.



MENDEL: Isn't it enough I want you every night'



TRINA: Heh.



MENDEL: Every other night'



TRINA: Hehehehehe.



MENDEL: Every third night'

Everything will be alright.



TRINA: Everything will be alright.



MENDEL & TRINA: Everything will be alright.



CORDELIA: How was your day at the hospital'



CHARLOTTE: It was wonderful.

For the first time in months, nobody died.

There were just heart attacks and gallstones,

Light bulbs up the ass,

Fake appendicitis, which is gas,

Which I diagnosed. People overdosed

And I saved them.



I save the young people, old people,

One priest and one high school principal!

Saving lives, I feel invincible!

Yes, I do!



Do you know how great my life is'

Do you know how great my life is,

Saving lives and loving you'



CORDELIA: You save lives and I save chicken fat, I can't fucking deal with that!



CHARLOTTE: Do you know how great my life is'



CORDELIA: Yes, I know how great your life is.



CHARLOTTE: Do you know how great my life is'



CORDELIA: Yes, I know how great your life is.



CHARLOTTE: Do you know how great my life is,



CORDELIA: Yes, I know how great-



MENDEL & TRINA: (overlapping)

Everything will be alright. Everything will be alright. Everything will be alright.



CHARLOTTE: Saving lives



CHARLOTTE & CORDELIA: And loving you.



(Marvin and Whizzer are playing racquetball)



WHIZZER: It bounced twice.



MARVIN: No, it didn't.



WHIZZER: Once, then twice. You know it did.



MARVIN: That's not nice.



WHIZZER: No, it isn't, but you're a pain in the ass!



MARVIN: You're a beast, but at least

When you play me, you win.



WHIZZER: You give up.



MARVIN: I perspire.



WHIZZER: Where's the heat' Where's the fire'

It used to be you'd desire a fight, so fight!



MARVIN: So play!



WHIZZER: One two three four!



MARVIN: One two three four!



WHIZZER: One two three four!



MARVIN: One two three four!



WHIZZER: Lucky dink.



MARVIN: I'm finessing.



WHIZZER: Something stinks in how you play.



MARVIN: Don't you think it's a blessing I'm so pathetically bad'



WHIZZER: Just stay back, sir, with force.

I'll attack and, of course, I will win! Just give in to bliss and kiss!



MARVIN: Let's go!

Do you know all I want is you'

Anything you do is alright!

Yes, it's alright!

Do you know all I want



WHIZZER: (speaking) (overlapping)

Down the alley!

High long!

Low jump! Oooh!

Ceiling shot!

Into the court!

Four walls! Dink!



MARVIN: Is you'



WHIZZER: It hit your shoe.



MARVIN: No, it didn't!



WHIZZER: Yes, it did. The game is through.



MARVIN: That's not nice.



WHIZZER: No, it isn't.



MARVIN: God, you're a pain in the ass!



WHIZZER: Play it raw, don't play pretty.

Sex and games in New York City

Have got to be played with flair

And passion, and passion and flair!



CHARLOTTE & CORDELIA:

Do you know how great my life is'

Do you know how great my life is,

Saving lives and loving you'



MARVIN & WHIZZER: (overlapping) Do you know all I want is you'

Anything you do is alright! Yes, it's alright!



MENDEL & TRINA: (overlapping)

Everything will be alright! Everything will be alright!



ALL: Everything will, everything will,

Everything will, everything will be alright! Alright!



JASON: (speaking) Soup's on!
