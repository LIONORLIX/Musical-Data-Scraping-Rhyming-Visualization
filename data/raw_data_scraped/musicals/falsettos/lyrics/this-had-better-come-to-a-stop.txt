This Had Better Come to a Stop


WHIZZER: Late for dinner, late again



WHIZZER, MARVIN, AND TRINA:

Late for dinner, late again

Late for dinner, late again

Late for dinner, late, late, late, late

MARVIN:

Whizzer's supposed to always be here

Make the dinner, set to screw

That's what pretty boys should do

Check their hairlines, make the dinner

And love me



This is going nowhere and fast, Whizzer

This little thing that we have will not last

Don't feel responsible, after all it's through



WHIZZER: I'm not responsible



MARVIN:

Life can be wonderful

Isn't this wonderful?

And this had better come to a stop, Whizzer

Now, Whizzer, ciao Whizzer, bend

This had better come to an end



TRINA:

I was supposed to make the dinner

Make it pretty on his plate

Every wife should pull her weight

Have it ready, make it tasty

And love him



This had better come to a stop doctor

This has been a lousy and horrible flop



MENDEL: Don't feel responsible, after all it's through



TRINA: Who is responsible?



MENDEL:

Don't ask me questions!

I'm frightened of questions

But grateful that it's come to a stop, Trina

Smile, Trina, I'll help you mend



WHIZZER AND TRINA:

I met this man today

He wasn't very smart, but he was rich, Marvin

Which, Marvin, do you prefer I lust for?

Brains or money?



MARVIN: Brains



WHIZZER AND TRINA: Brains or money?



MARVIN: I'm not that rich, but, hell, I'm smart

Love me



WHIZZER AND TRINA: No



MARVIN: Love me, please, or break my heart



WHIZZER AND TRINA: This is all very neat



MARVIN: This is all very neat. This is all very neat.



WHIZZER AND TRNA: This is all very smart



MARVIN:

This is all very smart

This had better come to a stop, Mendel

Don't touch me, don't condescend

This had better come

This had better come to a

This, this, this, this

This had better come to an end



TRINA:

Chop, chop, chop, chop, chop

I chopped it and served his food

The asshole forced me



WHIZZER, MENDEL, AND JASON: Chop, chop, chop, chop, chop, chop, chop



TRINA: And still the bastard divorced me



WHIZZER, MENDEL, AND JASON: Chop, chop, chop, chop, chop, chop, chop



MARVIN: Late for dinner, late again



TRINA: It isn't like he said



MARVIN: Late for dinner, late again



TRINA: You probably hurt his pride



MARVIN: Late for dinner, late again



TRINA: He's got to have it all



MARVIN: Late for dinner, late again



TRINA: He's like a baby who's denied



WHIZZER, MENDEL, AND JASON: This had better come to a stop, Marvin



WHIZZER, TRINA, MENDEL, AND JASON: This has been a lousy but fabulous flop



WHIZZER: Why is it always ourselves who have to change?



MARVIN: This is incredibly boring



WHIZZER, TRINA, MENDEL, AND JASON:

You've got a temper that redefines temper

And this had better come to a stop, Marvin

Now, Marvin, ciao Marvin, bend

This had better come

This had better come to a

This, this, this

This had better come to an end



MARVIN: This had better come to an end



ALL: This had better come to an end
