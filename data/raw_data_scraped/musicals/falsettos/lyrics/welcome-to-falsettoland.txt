Since we last spoke

Two years are waning.

I'll try explaining

Just what you missed.



We called a truce.

And fitfully we coexist.

She still with the psychiatrist.

So I don't have a psychiatrist,

Except on the Jewish holidays but I still have my son on the weekends.

Just on the weekends,

And some very good friends.

But I don't have a lover anymore,

Oh my God.

As mature as my son, who is twelve and a half.

And this tall!

That's all I'd like to be.

That's all!

It's about growing up, getting older, living on a lover's shoulder.

Learning love is not a crime.
