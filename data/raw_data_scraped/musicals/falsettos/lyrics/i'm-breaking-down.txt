I'm Breaking Down


TRINA:

I'd like to be a princess on a throne,

To have a country I can call my own.

And a king

Who's lusty and requires a fling

With a female thing.



Great... Men will be men...

Let me turn on the gas.

I saw them in the den

With Marvin grabbing Whizzer's ass.



Oh, sure, I'm sure he's sure, he did his best.

I mean, he tried (meant) to be what I was not.

The things he was are things which I've forgot.

He's a queen.

I'm a queen.

Where is our crown?



I'm breaking down.

I'm breaking down.

My life is shitty

And my kid seems like an idiot to me.

I mean, that's wrong (sick).

I mean, he's great.

It's me who is the matter,

Talking madder than the maddest hatter.

If I repeat one more word,

I swear I'll lose my brain.

What else should I explain?

Oh yes, it's true I can cry on cue

But so can you.

I'm breaking down.

I'm breaking down.

Down. Down.

You ask me "Is it fun to cry over nothing?"

It is. I'm breaking down.



(Speaking:)

Oh, darn, don't have time for a breakdown now.

Have to get back to my banana-carrot surprise.



(She cuts her finger while chopping.)



Oh, that really hurts.



(Singing:)

Now lets consider what I might do next.

I hate admitting that I've become perplexed.

I'm berieved, I've cried

I've shook, I've yelled, I've heaved,

I have been decieved.



As, enemies go, Whizzer is not so bad.

It's just hes so damn happy,

That it makes me so damn mad



I wanna hate him, but I really can't.

It's like a nightmare how this all proceeds.

I hope that Whizzer don't fulfill his need.

"Don't" is wrong.

Sing along.

What was the noun?



I'm breaking down.

I'm breaking down.

I'll soon redecorate these stalls.

I'd like some padding on the walls.

And also pills.

I wanna sleep.

Sure things will prob'ly worsen,

But it's not like I'm some healthy person.

I've rethought my talks with Marv,

And one fact does emerge:

I think I like his shrink.

So that is why I could use a (should turn to) drink.

I'm on the brink of breaking down.

I'm breaking down.

Down. Down.

I only want to love a man who can love me

Or like me

Or help me.



Marvin was never mine.

He took his meetings in the boys' latrine.

I used to cry.

He'd make a scene.

I'd rather die than dry clean

Marvin's wedding gown.

I'm breaking down.

I'm breaking down.

It's so upsetting when I found

That what's rectangular is round.

I mean, it stinks.

I mean, he's queer.

And me, I'm just a freak

Who needs it maybe every other week!

I've rethought the fun we had,

And one fact does emerge:

I've played a foolish clown.

The almost-virgin who sings this dirge

Is on the verge of breaking down.

I'm breaking down.

Down. Down.

The only thing that's breaking up

Is my family.



The only thing that's breaking up

Is my family.

But me, I'm breaking down. Down.



(She collapses. Blackout.)
