Father to Son


JASON:

My father says that love

Is the most beautiful thing in the world.

I think girls are,

I think girls are the most

Beautiful thing,

Not love.



MARVIN:

Kid, be my son.

What I've done to you is rotten.

Say I was scared.

I kept marching in one place,

Marching in time

To a tune I'd forgotten.



I loved you, I love you.

I meant no disgrace.

This here is love,

When we're talking

Face to face.



Father to son,

I, for one, would take love slower.

I've made my choice,

But you can sing a different song.

Watch as you sing,

How your voice gets much lower.



You'll be, kid, a man, kid,

If nothing goes wrong.

Sing for yourself

As we march

Along.



A man, kid, you'll be, kid,

Whatever the song.

Sing for yourself

As we march

Along.
