Kindergarten Boyfriend


There was a boy I met in kindergarten

He was sweet, he said that I was smart

He was good at sports and people liked him

And at nap time once we shared a mat

I didn't sleep I sat and watched him breathing

Watched and dreamed for nearly half an hour

Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

Then he woke up



He pulled a scab off one time playing kick ball

Kissed me quick then pressed it in my hand

I took that scab and put it in a locket

All year long I wore it near my heart

He didn't care if I was thin or pretty

And he was mine until we hit first grade

Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

Then he woke up



Last night I dreamed a horse with wings

Flew down into my home room

On its back there he sat

And he held out his arm

So we sailed above the gym

Across the faculty parking lot

My kindergarten boyfriend and I

And a horse with wings



Now we're all grown up and we know better

Now we recognize the way things are

Certain boys are just for kindergarten

Certain girls are meant to be alone

But I believe any dream worth having

Is a dream that should not have to end

So I'll build a dream that I can live in

And this time I'm never waking up



And we'll soar above the trees

Over cars and croquet lawns

Past the church and the lake

And the try-county mall

We will fly through the dawn

To a new kindergarten

Where nap time is centuries long

Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

Ooh ooh
