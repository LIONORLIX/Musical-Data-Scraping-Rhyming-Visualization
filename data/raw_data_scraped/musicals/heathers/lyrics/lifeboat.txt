Lifeboat


Heather McNamara

I float in a boat

In a raging black ocean

Low in the water

With no where to go

The tiniest lifeboat

With people I know



Cold, clammy, and crowded

The people smell desperate

We'll sink any minute

So someone must go

The tiniest lifeboat

With the people I know



Everyone's pushing

Everyone's fighting

Storms are approaching

There's nowhere to hide

If I say the wrong thing

Or I wear the wrong outfit

They'll throw me right over the side



I'm hugging my knees

And the captain is pointing

Well who made her captain?

Still, the weakest must go

The tiniest lifeboat

Full of people I know

The tiniest lifeboat

Full of people I know
