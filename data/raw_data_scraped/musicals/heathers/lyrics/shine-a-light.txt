Shine a Light


MS. FLEMING

Deep inside of everyone

There's a hot ball of shame

Guilt, regret, anxiety,

Fears we dare not name.

But, if we show the ugly parts

That we hide away,

They turn out to be beautiful

By the light of day.



MS. FLEMING

Why not,



COMPANY

Shine, shine, shine a light,



MS. FLEMING

On your deepest fears!



COMPANY

Let in sunlight now.



MS. FLEMING

And your pain will disappear!



COMPANY

Shine, shine, shine.



MS. FLEMING

And your scars and your flaws,



COMPANY

Will look lovely because you shine!



MS. FLEMING

You shine a light.



COMPANY

Shine, shine, shine a light.

Shine, shine, shine a light.



PUNK GIRL

Everyday's a battlefield

When pride's on the line.



PRETTY JOCK

I attack your weakness



PUNK GIRL & JOCK

And pray you don't see mine.



NERD BOY

But if i share my ugly parts,



NERD BOY & GIRL & MS. FLEMING

And you show me yours.

Our love can knock our walls down

And unlock all our doors.



MS. FLEMING & COMPANY

Go on and,

Shine, shine, shine a light,



MS. FLEMING

On your deepest fears!



COMPANY

Let in sunlight now.



MS. FLEMING

And your pain will disappear!



MS. FLEMING

Who wants to share what's in their heart?

No volunteers, fine, i'll start,

My name's Pauline.

I live alone.

My husband left,

My kids are grown.

In the 60's love was free,

That did not work out well for me.

The revolution came and went

Tried to change the world,

Barely made a dent.

I have struggled with despair.

I've joined a cult,

Chopped off my hair.

I chant, i prayed, but god's not there.

So Steve! I'm ending our affair!

And i faked it, every, single time.

Woo, it feels fan-freaking-tastic

1, 2 take me home kids!



COMPANY

Shine, shine, shine a light,



MS. FLEMING

On your deepest fears!



COMPANY

Let in sunlight now.



MS. FLEMING

And your pain will disappear!



COMPANY

Shine, shine, shine.



MS. FLEMING

And your scars and your flaws,



MS. FLEMING & Company

Will look lovely because you shine!

(Ahh, ahh, ahh)



MS. FLEMING

You shine, you shine a liiiiiiiiiiiight.



MS. FLEMING & COMPANY

Shine, shine, shine a light.

Shine, shine, shine a light.

Shine, shine, shine a light.

Shine, shine, shine a light.

Shine, shine, shine a light.

Shine, shine, shine a light.

Shine, shine, shine a light.

Shine a light! YEAH!
