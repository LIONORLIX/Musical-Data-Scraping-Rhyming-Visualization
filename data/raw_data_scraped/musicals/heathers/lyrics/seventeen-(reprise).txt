Seventeen (reprise)


Veronica:

Listen up kids, war is over, brand new sheriff's come to town

We are done with acting evil, we will lay our weapons down

We're all damaged, we're all frightened, we're all freaks but that's alright

We'll endure it, we'll survive it, Martha are you free tonight?



(dialogue)



Veronica:

I can't promise no more Heathers, high school may not ever end, still I miss you, I'd be honored, if you'd let me be your friend



Martha:

My friend



Both:

We can be seventeen, we can learn how to chill, if no one loves me now, some day somebody will

We can be seventeen, still time to make things right, one day we'll change the world, but let's kick back tonight



Girls:

Let's go be seventeen, take off our clothes and dance



Boys:

You know, you know, you know, we can be beautiful



Girls:

Act like we're all still kids, cause this may be our final chance

Always be seventeen, celebrate you and i, maybe we won't grow old



All:

And maybe then we'll never die

We'll make it beautiful x 2

Beautiful x9
