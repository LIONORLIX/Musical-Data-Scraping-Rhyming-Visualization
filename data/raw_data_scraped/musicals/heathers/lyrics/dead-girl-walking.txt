Dead Girl Walking


VERONICA

The demon queen of high school has decreed it:

She says Monday, 8 am, I will be deleted

They'll hunt me down in study hall,

Stuff and mount me on the wall;

Thirty hours to live -

how shall i spend them?

I don't have to stay and die like cattle;

I could change my name and ride up to Seattle

But I don't own a motorbike -

Wait...here's an option that I like:

Spend those thirty hours gettin'... freakay!

Yeah!

I need it hard,

I'm a dead girl walking!

I'm in your yard,

I'm a dead girl walking!

Before they punch my clock,

I'm snappin' off your window lock.

Got no time to knock

I'm a dead girl walking!



(VERONICA climbs through J.D.'s window)



J.D.

(spoken) Veronica? What're you doing in my room?



VERONICA

(spoken) Shhhh.

Sorry, but I really had to wake you;

See, I decided I must ride you till I break you.

'Cause Heather says I gots to go;

You're my last meal on death row.

Shut your mouth and lose them tighty-whities!

Come on!

Tonight I'm yours,

I'm a dead girl walking!

Get on all fours,

Kiss this dead girl walking!

Let's go, you know the drill;

I'm hot and pissed and on the pill.

Bow down to the will of a dead girl walking!

And you know, you know, you know

it's 'cause you're beautiful.

You say you're numb inside,

But I can't agree.

So the world's unfair,

Keep it locked out there...

In here it's beautiful.

Let's make this beautiful!



J.D.

That works for me -



(VERONICA kisses him hard. They make out.)



VERONICA

Yeah! Full steam ahead!

Take this dead girl walking



J.D.

How'd you find my address?





VERONICA

Let's break the bed!

Rock this dead girl walking!



J.D.

I think you tore my mattress!



VERONICA

No sleep tonight for you,

Better chug that Mountain Dew!



J.D.

Okay, okay.



VERONICA

Get your ass in gear,

Make this whole town disappear!



J.D.

Okay, okay!



VERONICA

Slap me! Pull my hair,

touch me there and there and there

But no more talking!



J.D.

Whoa, whoa! Hey, hey!

Yeah, yeah!



VERONICA & J.D.

Love this dead girl...



J.D.

Whoa, whoa! Hey, hey! Wait, wait!



VERONICA

Love this dead girl...



VERONICA & J.D.

Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!



J.D.

Ow!



VERONICA & J.D.

Yeah!!!
