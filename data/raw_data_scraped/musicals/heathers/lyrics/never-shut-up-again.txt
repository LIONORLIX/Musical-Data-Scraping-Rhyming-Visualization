Never Shut Up Again


[HEATHER DUKE, spoken]

No, Veronica! You shut up!



[HEATHER MCNAMARA, spoken]

Hey! That's Heather’s scrunchie!



[HEATHER DUKE, spoken]

Ha ha ha ha ha! Not anymore



[Sung]

Heather choked

Bought the farm

She could not hack it

Now we need a strong arm

To run this racket



Heather's out

Who will rise?

Gotta fill that vacuum

It's my turn

It’s my prize

I spit lightning

Crack, boom!



I bit my tongue so long

I learned to count to ten

My silence made me strong

I did my time and then

A house dropped on her head

The witch is dead! Ding dong!

Move bitch, this my song!



I will never shut up again

I will never shut up again

Brand new day watching dreams come true

Well for me, not you

Cause I'll never shut up again



Girls like me don't climb high

Can't crack that ceiling

But now I scrape the sky

It's you who's kneeling

Heather's pet, you're old news

Look at you, you’re busted

You think you’ll fill her shoes

Too late I just did



Now I don't mean to brag

Once I was one of you

But now I am the flag

You pledge allegiance to

I am the dream you chase

I’m your amazing grace

Yo, party's at my place!



I will never shut up again

I will never shut up again

Brand new day

Now we're finally free

Free to worship me

'Cause I’ll never shut up-

Shut up!



Don't judge me

Little Miss innocence

Your hands ain't clean

I've seen your fingerprints

You act so uptight

So virgin white

But I heard from the boys

What you were up to last night



[KURT, spoken]

Veronica's my wet dream



[RAM, spoken]

Veronica likes to scream



[KURT, spoken]

Veronica took one for the team



[RAM, spoken]

She took two for the team



[VERONICA, spoken]

What?



[KURT AND RAM]

That girl was on her back

That girl was big fun, big fun

We smoked her crack

That crack was big fun

And that's when things went South

We had a swordfight in her mouth



[HEATHER D/ENSEMBLE]

Dang diggity dang-a-dang

Freak!

Dang diggity dang-a-dang

Slut!

Dang diggity dang-a-dang

Swordfight in her mouth! Ha!



[HEATHER DUKE/ENSEMBLE]

I will never shut up again!

I will never shut up again!

I'm on fire and you're my fuel

You should find a new school

'Cause I'll never shut up again! (Never shut up again)



No-No-No-No!

No-No-No-No-No-No-No-No! (Never shut up again)



All hail the queen

I wear the red (Never shut up again)

The scrunchie's on my head

You can't run

You can't hide

I am a crimson tide (Never shut up again)

You better mind what you do

Big sister's watching you (Never shut up again)

Can I get an amen? (HEY!)

'Cause I will never shut up again (Never shut up again)

Hah!
