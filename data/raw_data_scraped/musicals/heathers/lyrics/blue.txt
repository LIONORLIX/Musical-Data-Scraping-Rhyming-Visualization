RAM

Heyyyyy, 'Ronica.



VERONICA

Ugh. You got a left hand? Use it.



KURT

Don't talk mean like that.



RAM

You'll hurt their feelings.

You make my balls so blue.



KURT

You hurt them badly.



RAM

You make my balls so blue.



KURT

They're hangin' sadly.



RAM

What did they do to you

that you hate them so?



KURT

Don't run from me --

They're all beat up



KURT & RAM

like a tackling dummy!



KURT

They long for your embrace!



RAM

They're warm like mittens!



KURT

They'll curl up on your face



RAM

and purr like kittens!



KURT

You make my balls so blue!

RAM

Hold 'em!



KURT

Enfold 'em,



KURT & RAM

and never let go!



KURT

Once you were geeky and nerdy,



RAM

but they knew you're dirty.



KURT

You've set them on fire,



KURT & RAM

Whatever you require they'll do!

So take 'em home to meet your parents!



RAM

They'll wear a suit and tie,



KURT

and a fancy collar!



RAM

They'll sing a lullaby:



KURT & RAM

La la la la la!

Please make these balls not blue,



RAM

Just for a while!



KURT

Can't wait till later,



KURT & RAM

my pants are rubbin'

like a hot cheese grater!



(VERONICA offers a bottle to RAM)



VERONICA

Look. Booze. Drink!



KURT

Aw, thank you so much!



VERONICA

You're welcome.



(KURT & RAM chug from the bottle)



RAM

They will protect you.



KURT

Defend you.

Respect you.



KURT

Befriend you --



RAM

Like Winnie-the-Pooh!



HEATHER DUKE & MCNAMARA
