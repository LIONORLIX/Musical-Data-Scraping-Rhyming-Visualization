Prom or Hell?


Dear Diary,

I'm going steady

Mostly he's awesome

If a bit too "rock and roll"



Lately he's bumped off

Three of my classmates

God, have mercy on my soul



They were just seventeen

They still had room to grow

They could have turned out good

And now we'll never know



Dear Diary,

My teen angst bullshit has a body count.
