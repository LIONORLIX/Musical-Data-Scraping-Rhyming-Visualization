You're Welcome


[Kurt] (spoken)

Aw, you can't just leave...



[Ram] (spoken)

Not when you're dressed like that...



[Veronica] (spoken)

Dressed like what? This is what I always wear



[Kurt] (spoken)

Yeah and it's torture!



[Ram] (spoken)

How can you expect us to control ourselves

when you look like that?



[Veronica]

Dear Diary

Here we are in the dark fifty yards from my car

I could climb that tree, I'd never get that far...

They're a hundred pounds heavier, they have my keys

I'm a rat in a trap, correction:

I'm the cheese



[Kurt]

Hey there girl, ignore this fool

He tries to play cool while he’s dribbling drool



[Ram]

Just trying to say in our friendly way

That you’ve gotten hotter like every day



[Kurt]

OW!!



[Ram]

Hey there girl, avoid this punk

He’s hungry for a hunk of the junk in your trunk



[Kurt]

There is no lie that dog won’t try

When a tasty treat like you walks by, cause



[Kurt/Ram]

Once, you were geeky and nerdy

Now you’re flirty, freaky, and dirty



[Ram]

You were nothing and nobody...



[Kurt]

...but now you’re good enough to



[Kurt/Ram]

Get with me! HUH!

You’re welcome, look where you are

You’re welcome, you’ve won a football star!

You’re welcome



[Ram]

Baby, what's that smell?



[Kurt]

That's the smell of me lovin' you well



[Kurt/Ram]

You're welcome!



[They both "beat-box"]



[Veronica]

This is not a drill

This is not a bad dream

In a cow pasture, no one can hear you scream

Never break their stare, stay awake, stay aware

You're not in real danger 'til they grab your hair



[Ram]

Come back girl, now don’t play hurt

If you don’t want me starin’, why you wearin’ that skirt?



[Kurt]

We can’t be tamed and we can’t be blamed

It’s all your fault that we’re inflamed!



[Kurt/Ram]

Cause once, you were grody and grotty



[Ram]

Now you’ve got a body like a Maserati!



[Kurt/Ram]

Stroke my fur, make me purr-



[Kurt]

Hey! You wanted to be



[Kurt/Ram]

Popular!



[Kurt]

Hit me!



[Ram]

HUH!



[Kurt/Ram]

You’re welcome, look where you are

You’re welcome, come get your football star

You’re welcome



[Ram]

You've joined the pros!



[Kurt]

Once we squeeze you

You'll stay "squoze"



[Ram]

You’re welcome in my lap, welcome on my knee



[Kurt]

Well, come on and get grabby in the grass with me!



[Veronica]

I got one last chance to save my ass

What was that move from my self-defence class?



[Ram]

I’ll steal your heart like a thief

Bring you sweet relief



[Kurt]

Call me Wendy cause you never wonder



[Kurt/Ram]

‘Where’s the beef?’



[Veronica]

They're a powder keg

So don't yell or beg

Stay friendly

Then gently, accidentally sweep the leg



[Kurt/Ram]

No! Oh gross! This mud stinks!



[Veronica]

You’re welcome



[Kurt]

Back up fool you reak!



[Veronica]

You’re welcome



[Ram]

Well you smell like a sewage leak



[Veronica]

You’re welcome



[Kurt]

Wait dude, I'm pretty sure, this ain't mud it's



[Kurt/Ram]

Cow manure!



[Veronica]

You’re welcome



[Kurt/Ram]

Ah! It's everywhere!



[Veronica]

You’re welcome



[Kurt/Ram]

Hold on it's in my hair!



[Veronica]

You’re welcome



[Kurt/Ram]

Hey girl, now let's not dwell

On the smell you can tell I could still be loving you well



[Veronica]

'Swell'



[Kurt/Ram]

No, I'll be loving her well



[Veronica]

See you in hell!



[Kurt/Ram]

No, I'll be loving her well

No I'll be, I'll be, I'll be, I'll be

Lovin', lovin', lovin', lovin', lovin' her well!



[All]

You’re welcome! You’re welcome! You’re welcome!?
