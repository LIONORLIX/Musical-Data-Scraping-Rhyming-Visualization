Sympathy, Tenderness


LUCY:

Sympathy, tenderness,

Warm as the Summer,

Offer me their embrace.



Friendliness, gentleness,

Strangers to my life,

They are there in his face.



Goodness and sweetness

And kindness

Abound in this place



I am in love

With the things

That I see in his face -

It's a memory I know

Time will never erase...
