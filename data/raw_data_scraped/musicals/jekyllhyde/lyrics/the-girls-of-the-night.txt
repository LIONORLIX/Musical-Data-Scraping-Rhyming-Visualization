The Girls Of The Night


NELLIE

We're the pleasures of the nighttime that fade at dawn,

selling treasures of the nighttime til night is gone.

And then when the party's over, everybody's gone away,

we stare at an empty day - what is there to do or say?



Nighttime is where we live,

night is when we give everything we have to give.

Most lovers can rejoice, we don't have a choice,

we just know we have to give.

That's why the day can never be bright

for the girls of the night.



LUCY

Somehow I know there's a someday that's just for me.

Everybody has a someday - so why not me?



NELLIE

Lucy, do you really need to fill your heart with empty dreams?

You'll always be what you are - stop chasing that distant star!



BOTH

Nighttime is where we live,

night is when we give everything we have to give.

Most lovers can rejoice, we don't have a choice,

we just know we have to give.

That's why the day can never be bright

for the girls of the night.



LUCY

Fly away, fly away, let me find my wings.

Let me be the girl I want to be!



NELLIE

I'm afraid to fly away, for all I have is here.



LUCY

I have my hopes ...



NELLIE

I have a child, and children must be fed.

Forget your hopes, or you will be misled!

With the dawn they disappear ...



LUCY

... then why are mine still here?



NELLIE

Fly away, fly away, fly away ...



BOTH

Ask me to share your fantasies, dear,

but don't ask me where tomorrow is.

Don't ask me where to find happiness,

though I know for sure where sorrow is.



NELLIE

Sorrow is where the dark meets the light ...



LUCY

Someday I pray my fears will take flight ...



BOTH

Sorrow is where all hope fades from sight

for the girls of the night ...

We're the girls of the night ...

Just the girls of the night ...
