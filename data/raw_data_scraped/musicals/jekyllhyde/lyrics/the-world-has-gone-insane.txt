The World Has Gone Insane


JEKYLL

The world has gone insane!

And parasites are eating at my brain!

And nothing is the way it was before!

A pack o' wolves is howling at my door!

I'm living in a non-stop nightmare!

Dead men's dreams!

Filled with screaming pain!

Hurling me to mad extremes

In a world that's gone insane!



The world has lost its head!

And every evil hour is filled with dread!

I'm floating on a lake - But upside down!

And when I try to breathe, I start to drown!

I cannot speak

As nameless ghosts and faceless ghouls

Bid me join the dead!

No one tells these gruesome fools

That the world has lost its head!



Fiendish creatures leave their graves to taunt me!

Old friends risen from the dead to haunt me!

Godforsaken images that daunt me

Drowning in an endless flood of blood!



The world has lost its mind!

And everywhere I turn, I fear I'll find

Some nightmare even worse than those I see!

Satanic demons closing in on me!

How can it be

That even though they see my plight,

Everyone is blind!

Night is day and day is night

In a world that's lost its mind!



The world has gone berserk!

And hiding in the murk, new monsters lurk!

I see a sea of snakes upon the floor!

I see the reaper grinning at my door!

I scream in silence!



Bad is good and good is bad!

Sacred if profane!

And it's wiser to be mad...



HYDE

In a world that's gone insane!
