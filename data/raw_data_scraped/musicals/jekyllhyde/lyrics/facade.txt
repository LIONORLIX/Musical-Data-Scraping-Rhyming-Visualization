Facade


ENSEMBLE:

There's a face that we wear

In the cold light of day -

It's society's mask,

It's society's way,

And the truth is

That it's all a facade!



There's a face that we hide

Till the nighttime appears,

And what's hiding inside,

Behind all of our fears,

Is our true self,

Locked inside the facade!



Every day

People, in their own sweet way,

Like to add a coat of paint,

And be what they ain't!



That's how our little -

Game is played,

Livin' like a masquerade

Actin' a bizarre charade -

While playing the saint!



But there's one thing I know,

And I know it for sure:

This disease that we've got

Has got no ready cure!

And I'm certain

Life is terribly hard -

When your life's a facade!



Look around you!

I have found

You cannot tell, by lookin' at the surface,

What is lurkin' there beneath it!

See that face!

Now, I'm prepared to bet you,

What you see's not what you get -

'Cause man's a master of deceit !



So, what is the sinister secret?

The lie he will tell you is true? -

It's that each man you meet

In the street

Isn't one man but two!



Nearly everyone you see -

Like him an' her,

An' you, an' me -

Pretends to be

A pillar of society -

A model for propriety -

Sobriety

An' piety -

Who shudders at the thought

Of notoriety!



The ladies an' gents 'ere before you -

Which none of 'em ever admits -

May 'ave saintly looks -

But they're sinners an' crooks!



Hypocrites!

Hypocrites!



There are preachers who kill!

There are killers who preach!

There are teachers who lie!

There are liars who teach!

Take yer pick, dear -

"Cause it's all a facade!



If we're not one, but two,

Are we evil or good?

Do we walk the fine line -

That we'd cross if we could?

Are we waiting -

To break through the facade?



One or two

Might look kinda well-to-do -

Hah! They're bad as me an' you,

Right down they're boots!



I'm inclined to think -

Half mankind

Thinks the other half is blind!

Wouldn't be surprise to find -

They're all in cahoots!



At the end of the day,

They don't mean what they say,

They don't say what they mean,

They don't ever come clean -

And the answer -

Is it's all a facade!

Is it's all a facade!

Man is not one, but two,

He is evil and good,

An' he walks the fine line

We'd all cross if we could!



It's a nightmare

We can never discard

So we stay on our guard

Though we love the facade

What's behind the facade?

Look behind the facade!
