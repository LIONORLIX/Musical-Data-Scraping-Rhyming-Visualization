I Must Go On / Take Me As I Am


I Must Go On



JEKYLL:

I must go on

With the work I'm committed to -

How can I not,

When my theories are true?

And I will prove,

If I'm ever permitted to,

Things are not wrong,

Just because they are new!



EMMA:

Henry, I adore,

Always have done,

Always will do,

And your dreams are mine!



I will always understand.

However hard the path you've planned,

Our lives will intertwine...



JEKYLL:

Who knows where my work will lead me?



EMMA:

Nowhere where you will not need me!



JEKYLL:

Emma, please I beg you, heed me!



EMMA:

Just don't leave me on my own!



JEKYLL:

The only thing I fear is the unknown...



EMMA:

When this all began,

We knew there'd be a price to pay!

Too late now to turn away -

We have come too far!

I know we'll find a way...



Take Me As I Am



JEKYLL:

Sometimes I see

Past the horizon,

Sure of my way,

Where I am going -



But where's the prize

I have my eyes on?

Where?

There is just no knowing!



And when despair

Tears me in two,

Who can I turn to

But you?

You know who I am...

Take me as I am.



EMMA:

Look in my eyes,

Who do you see there?

Someone you know,

Or just a stranger?



If you are wise,

You will see me there!

Love is the only danger!



Love meaning me,

Love meaning you,

We'll make that one dream come true!

You know who I am...

Take me as I am.



JEKYLL & EMMA:

Though fate won't always do

What we desire -

Still we can set

The world on fire!



Give me your hand,

Give me your heart -



JEKYLL:

Swear to me we'll never part!



EMMA:

We'll never part!



JEKYLL:

You know who I am.



EMMA:

You know who I am.



JEKYLL:

This is who I am.



EMMA:

This is who I am.



JEKYLL & EMMA:

Take me as I am...
