Reflections


JEKYLL

My two natures have memory in common.

I am aware that I am slowly losing hold

Of my original and better self...

And becoming absorbed into my second

And worse self.



Hyde, alone in the ranks of mankind, is pure evil.

As Jekyll, I can share in the pleasures and wickedness of Hyde.

I have more than a father's interest in him,

And he has more than a son's indifference towards me!

As Hyde, I care only for myself

And nothing for Jekyll!

As Jekyll, I know how Hyde

Fears my power to cut him off - by suicide!

And yet I find it in my heart to pity him

So wonderful is his love of life!

So wonderful is his love of life!
