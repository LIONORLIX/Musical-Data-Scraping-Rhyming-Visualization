First Transformation


JEKYLL:

I must be wise,

I must try to analyze

Each change in me,

Everything I see -

How will it be?

Will I see the world

Through different eyes?



Like a warning light,

Glimmering in red,

Like crimson bloodshed,

Shimmering in red,

Beautiful and strange,

See the colors change

Before my eyes!

See how they dance

And they sparkle,

Like diamonds at night -

Leading out of the darkness

And into the light!



Three fifty-eight a.m. It is done.

I have injected 5 centiliters of the newly fused formula.

A slight feeling of euphoria.

Light-headedness. No noticeable behavioral differences.



Now the die is cast!

Nothing left to do...

Time along can prove

My theories true...

Show the world...



Dear God! What is this?



Something is happening -

I can't explain -

Something inside me -

A breathtaking pain -

Devours and consumes me -

And drives me insane!



Suddenly -

Uncontrolled -

Something is

Taking hold!



Suddenly -

Agony -

Filling me!

Killing me!

Suddenly -

Out of breath!

What is this?

Is this death?



Suddenly -

Look at me! -

Can it be?

Who is this

Creature

That I see?



Free!
