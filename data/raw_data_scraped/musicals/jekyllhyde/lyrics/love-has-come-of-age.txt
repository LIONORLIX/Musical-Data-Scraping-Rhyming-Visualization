Love Has Come Of Age


JEKYLL AND EMMA

I had never touched a hand,

That felt as soft as rain,

Until tonight.



I had never known a kiss,

Could make you feel this way,

Until tonight

But here we are now,

Feeling things we've never felt before.



I never knew that I could feel such wonder.

I never dreamed that love could be like this

Yet in this rapture I'm swept away,

Lost in your eyes

For tonight, Love has come of age



I had never dreamed that I,

Would lose my heart so soon,

Until tonight.

I had never felt my heart,

Racing with the moon,

Until tonight



Now and forever,

Let me live inside your sweet embrace.



I never knew that I could feel such wonder

I never dreamed that love could be like this

Yet in this rapture I'm swept away,

Lost in your eyes.

For tonight, Love has come of age.



If I could make this moment last forever,

If only I could make the time stand still.

Before the dawn I would find a way,

For you and I,

For tonight, Love has come of age.



Tonight, Love has come of age.
