Facade (Reprise 2)


ENSEMBLE:

'Ere in London East End,

It's the pit of the Earth -

Where you won't find a friend -

Where yer life 'as no worth -

Death is waiting -

Fate is makin' yer card.



You got one chance in five -

They're the odds you must beat

If you wanna survive -

So be fast on yer feet!

Life's 'ard 'ere -

It's the devil's backyard!
