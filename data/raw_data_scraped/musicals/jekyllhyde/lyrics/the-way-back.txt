The Way Back


JEKYLL:

Somehow I have to get back

To the place where my journey started,

Find the course I charted,

When I first departed!



Somehow I have to hang on

To the vision that first inspired me,

To the hope that fired me,

When the world admired me!



I'll find a way back to the higher ground,

And see the view I saw before!

I'll search the world

Until the answer's found -

Turn my despair around

Forevermore!



Somehow I've got to rebuild

All the dreams that the winds have scattered,

From what fate has shattered -

I'll retrieve what mattered!



Somehow I've got to go on,

Till the evil has been defeated -

Till my works completed -

I will not be cheated!



God, you must help me carry on!

When it seems all hopes has gone,

I have got to carry on!
