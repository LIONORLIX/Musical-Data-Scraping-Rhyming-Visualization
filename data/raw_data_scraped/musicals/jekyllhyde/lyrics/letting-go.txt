Letting Go


SIR DANVERS:

Emma, don't you understand!

It's you I am concerned for.



EMMA:

Father, don't be!

You should be concerned for him!

He's the one in need!



SIR DANVERS:

I am only trying to protect you!

What else would you have your father do?

I think I would die,

If any harm should come to you.



I'm scared, my child,

Because I'm going to lose you.

I find it very hard,

To let you go!



EMMA:

Father,

If you try to,

You could never lose me!



Darling father,

I still love you,

More than you will ever know!

But if we want our love to grow -



SIR DANVERS:

I know, in time, I have to let you go.



EMMA & SIR DANVERS:

We mustn't be afraid of letting go...
