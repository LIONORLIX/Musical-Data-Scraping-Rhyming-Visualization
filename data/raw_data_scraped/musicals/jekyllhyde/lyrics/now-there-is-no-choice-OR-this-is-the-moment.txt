Now There Is No Choice / This Is The Moment


Now There Is No Choice



JEKYLL:

Now there is no choice:

I must put aside

The fears I feel inside...

There's no place to hide!



So it comes to this:

One great golden chance

That only I can take,

When everything I fought for

Is at stake!...

To make the mark

That only I can make!



This Is The Moment



JEKYLL:

This is the moment!

This is the day,

When I send all my doubts and demons

On their way!



Every endeavor,

I have made - ever -

Is coming into play,

Is here and now - today!



This is the moment,

This is the time,

When the momentum and the moment

Are in rhyme!



Give me this moment -

This precious chance -

I'll gather up my past

And make some sense at last!



This is the moment,

When all I've done -

All the dreaming,

Scheming and screaming,

Become one!



This is the day -

See it sparkle and shine,

When all I've lived for

Becomes mine!



For all these years,

I've faced the world alone,

And now the time has come

To prove to them

I've made it on my own!



This is the moment -

My final test -

Destiny beckoned,

I never reckoned,

Second Best!



I won't look down,

I must not fall!

This is the moment,

The sweetest moment of them all!



This is the moment!

Damn all the odds!

This day, or never,

I'll sit forever

With the gods!



When I look back,

I will always recall,

Moment for moment,

This was the moment,

The greatest moment

Of them all!
