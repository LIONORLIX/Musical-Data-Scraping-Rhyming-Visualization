No One Knows Who I Am


LUCY:

Look at me,

And tell me who I am.

Why I am

What I am.



Call me a fool,

And it's true I am.

I don't know

Who I am.



It's such a shame,

I'm such a sham.

No one knows

Who I am.



Am I the face of the future?

Am I the face of the past?

Am I the one who must finish last?



Look at me,

And tell me who I am,

Why I am

What I am.



Will I survive?

Who will give a damn,

If no one knows

Who I am?



Nobody knows -

Not even you -

No one knows who I am...
