If You Only Knew


EMMA CAREW

If you only knew how much I love you

Would you still behave the way you do?

Forever tempting fate,

While I just sit and wait.

And worry about what fate might do to you.



If you only knew how much I suffer

Would you maybe change your point of view?

Or will you still go on

Till all our dreams are gone

And hope that I will still be there for you



Must I go on like this forever?

Not knowing when or whether you?ll return

Do I just sit and yearn

Or try to live and learn

And learn to live with what you put me through?

If you only knew?



I?m not as fragile as I appear to be.

I won?t so easily break in two



If you only knew how much I wonder

Whether you?re aware that you need me too.

If you weren?t so blind

Together we could find

The peace of mind that makes our dreams come true

If you only knew?

If you only knew?

If you only knew?
