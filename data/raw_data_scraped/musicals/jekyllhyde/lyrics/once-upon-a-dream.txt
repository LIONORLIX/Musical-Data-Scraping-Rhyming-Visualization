Once Upon A Dream


EMMA:

When it's all began,

We knew there'd be a price...



Once upon a dream,

I was lost in love's embrace.

There I found a perfect place,

Once upon a dream.



Once there was a time,

Like no other time before,

Hope was still an open door,

Once upon a dream.



And I was unafraid,

The dream was so exciting!

But now I see it fade...

And I am here alone!



Once upon a dream,

You were heaven-sent to me,

Was it never meant to be?

Was it just a dream?



Could we begin again!...

Once upon a dream.
