I Need To Know


JEKYLL

I need to know

the nature of the demons that possess

man's soul!

I need to know

why man's content to let them make him less

than whole.



Why does he revel in murder and madness?

What is it makes him be less than he should?

Why is he doomed not to reach his potential?

His soul is black

when he turns his back

upon good.



I need to find

a way to get inside the tortured mind of man.

I need to try

to separate the good and evil - if I can.



One thing is certain - the evil is stronger.

Good fights a hopeless and desperate fight.

I must find ways of adjusting the balance

to bring him back from the empty black

edge of night!



I need to go

where no man has ventured before

to search for the key to the door

that will end all this tragic and senseless decay!

But how to go?

I need to know!



I need to learn

the secrets of the mind that we cannot discern.

I need to learn

the things that make men pass the point of no return.



Why does a wise man take leave of his senses?

Where is that fine line where sanity melts?

When does intelligence give way to madness?

A moment comes

when a man becomes

something else ...



I need to know

why man plays this strange double game!

His hand always close to the flame!

It's a deal with the devil he cannot disclaim!

But what's his aim?

I need to know!



Dear God, guide me!

Show me how to succeed!

With your wisdom inside me,

Henry Jekyll will follow wherever you lead!



I need to see

the truth other men cannot see

to be things that others can't be!

Give me courage to go

where no angel will go!

And I will go!

I need to know!
