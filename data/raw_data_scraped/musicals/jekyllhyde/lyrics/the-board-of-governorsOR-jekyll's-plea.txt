RECORDING SECRETARY

The Board of Governors of St. Jude's Hospital is now in session.

Sir Danvers Carew, KBE, Chairman.

His Grace, The Bishop of Basingstoke.

General Lord Glossop.

The Right Honorable Sir Archibald Proops, Q.C.

Lady Beaconsfield.

Lord Savage.

The Order of business will be conducted by the Secretary to the Board of Governors,

Mr. Simon Stride.



STRIDE

Proposition No. 929 - Presented by Dr. Henry Jekyll.



GENERAL GLOSSOP

Jekyll, you're all talk an' no result!...



BISHOP OF BASINGSTOKE

Forever asking us to endorse empty promises!



SIR ARCHIBALD PROOPS

What's all the mystery? Much ado about nothing, if you ask me...



LADY BEACONSFIELD

You're the laughing stock of your profession and polite society!

The mad scientist!



STRIDE

Order! Order!



JEKYLL

Distinguished Governors,

I have glimpsed the future.

Seen miracles that stun the mind

And marvels only science can find

To shape tomorrow for mankind.

And I can show them to you

If you wish me to.



Friends, you're aware there are two sides to each of us

Good and evil, compassion and hate.

If we could extract all the evil from each of us

Think of the world that we could create!

A world without anger or violence or strife

Where man wouldn't kill anymore!

A world of compassion, where passion for life

Would banish the madness of war!



I'm close to finding the key to duality

Chemical Formulae which could and would

Alter the patterns of man's personality

Guiding him either to evil or good!

Weigh the potential, the great possibilities

Colleagues - dear friends, understand!

We have a chance to make history here in our hand!



Each of us is the embodiment of two distinct and opposing forces -

Good and Evil - each fighting for supremacy inside us.

If we could separate these two forces,

we could control and ultimately eliminate all evil from mankind.

My experiments with animals have led me to believe

that the day is not far off when this separation will be possible. To achieve it,

I must be allowed to try my formula on a living human being!



BISHOP OF BASINGSTOKE

And what if you're right, Jekyll? And you do manage to separate

Good from Evil - What happens to the evil?



JEKYLL

There are doomed, broken souls in a thousand asylums

I defy you to say you don't care if you can!

In the name of compassion and medical science,

I can save many lives if you give me one man!



BISHOP OF BASINGSTOKE

I tell you now - the Church will never sanction it!



VARIOUS

Sacrilege! Lunacy! Blasphemy! Heresy!



SIR ARCHIBALD PROOPS

You seem to be treading on dangerous ground.

In legal terms, I'd say, extremely unsound!



BISHOP OF BASINGSTOKE

The whole thing's un-christian, barbaric and odd!

You're playing with fire when you start to play God!



STRIDE

The Bishop speaks for all of us, when he says you're playing God!

There's such a thing as ethics over which you ride rough-shod!

You're a Doctor, not a saviour,

Doctor Jekyll, for a start!

But I judge from your behaviour

You can't tell the two apart!



JEKYLL

Dear Mr. Stride, I am simply a scientist.

I have a code to which I remain true!

I don't presume to the stature of moralist.

I leave pretension like that, Sir, to you!



SIR DANVERS

Henry, I've always encouraged your enterprise

And I've been hopefull that you would succeed!

But in the face of these powerful arguments,

I see no choice but for you to concede!



JEKYLL

I know my fate is yours to choose

But if they win, the world would lose

I am on the brink of great success!

I beg you, Governors, you must say "Yes!"



LADY BEACONSFIELD

Doctor Jekyll, enough of this ranting, Sir!

This is a hospital, here to save lives!



GOVERNORS

Do you think we would let you play havoc

With all the high principles for which it strives?



Do you expect us to compromise all that we stand for

Indulging your dangerous games?

How many rules should we break for your dubious games?



JEKYLL

Can't you see?

I am not playing games!

Just give me the opportunity!



GENERAL GLOSSOP

This whole thing's too bizarre!



SIR DANVERS

Open up your eyes and see!



BISHOP OF BASINGSTOKE

This man has gone too far!



JEKYLL

Unless you listen to me...



STRIDE

Doctor, please watch your tone!

Dammit, man, can't you see?

You're on your own!



(Various arguing)



STRIDE

Order, order!



JEKYLL

If I ever needed further justification for my experiments, gentlemen,

You have just provided it!



Just look at what has happened here!

Mix anger with a touch of fear

The danger's all too crystal-clear

Just look at you!

Our darker side keeps breaking through

Observe it now - in me and you!

The evil that all men can do must be controlled!

I beg of you

I'll show you all it can be done!



Here is a chance to take charge of our fate

Deep down you must know that tomorrow's too late!

One rule of life we cannot rearrange

The only thing constant is change

The only thing constant...is change



STRIDE

Distinguished colleagues, your verdict, please.

All those is favour say "Aye"

All those opposed, "Nay"



GOVERNORS

Nay! Nay! Nay! Nay!

Positively - Absolutely - Nay!



STRIDE

Sir Danvers?



SIR DANVERS

Abstain.



STRIDE

By five votes to none - with one abstention

Proposition 929 is rejected

Thank you for your time, Dr. Jekyll
