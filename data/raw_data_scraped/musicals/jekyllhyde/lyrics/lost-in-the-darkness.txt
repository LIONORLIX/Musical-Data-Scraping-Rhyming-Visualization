Lost In The Darkness


JEKYLL:

Lost in the darkness,

Silence surrounds you.

Once there was morning,

Now endless night.



If I could reach you,

I'd guide you and teach you

To walk from the darkness

Back into the light.



Deep in your silence,

Please try to hear me;

I'll keep you near me

Till night passes by.



I will find the answer.

I'll never desert you

I promise you this

Till the day that I die...
