No One Must Ever Know


JEKYLL

No one must ever know what I have done,

For if anyone does all my work is undone,

And I must gain control of this monster inside,

In the name of the people who've died.

But how do I deal with a foe I can't see,

Who whenever he wants takes possession of me,

In a battle of wills that is raging inside,

Will I end up as me or as Hyde?



Could it be,

Have I really lost my way?

Have I lost my mind,

Will I lose the day?

Look at me and say,

Where it all went wrong,

This has been my dream,

My whole life long.

Those who dare to try.

Those who want to fly will find a way



Am I good man?

Am I mad man?

It's such a fine line between a good man and a bad...
