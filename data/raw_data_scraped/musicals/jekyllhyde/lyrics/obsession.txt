Obsession


JEKYLL:

What streak of madness lies inside me?

What is the truth my fears conceal?

What evil force makes Edward Hyde of me?

What darker side of me does he reveal?

What is this strange obsession

That's tearing me apart?

Some strange, deranged expression

Of what's in my heart?



Am I the man that I appear to be?

Or am I someone I don't know?

Is there some monster drawing near me to me?

Becoming clear to see?

Will what I fear to be

Be so?
