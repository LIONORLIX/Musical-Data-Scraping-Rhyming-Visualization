Facade (Reprise 4) / Finale


Facade (Reprise 4)



ENSEMBLE:

there's a beast at the door

And he's wild and free!

But we don't let him in,

'Cause we don't want to see -

what is lurking right behind the fa?ade!



Man is not one, but two!

He is evil and good!

And he walks the fine line

That he'd cross, if he could,

He's just waiting...!



Finale



EMMA:

You are free now...

You're with me now...

Where you'll always be...
