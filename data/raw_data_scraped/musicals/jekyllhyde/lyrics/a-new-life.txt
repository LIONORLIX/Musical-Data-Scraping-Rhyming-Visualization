A New Life


LUCY:

A New Life -

What I wouldn't give

To have a new life!

One thing I have learned

As I go through life:

Nothing is for free

Along the way!



A new start -

That's the thing I need,

To give me new heart -

Half a chance in life

To find a new part,

Just a simple role

That I can play.



A new hope -

Something to convince me

To renew hope!

A new day,

Bright enough

To help me find my way!



A new chance -

One that maybe has

A touch of romance.

Where can it be,

The chance for me?



A new dream -

I have one I know

That very few dream!

I would like to see

That overdue dream -

Even though

It never may come true!

A new love -

Though I know there's no

Such thing as true love -

Even so,

Although I never knew love,

Still I feel that

One dream is my due!



A new world -

This one thing I want

To ask of you, world -

Once! - Before it's time

To say adieu, world!

One sweet chance to

Prove the cynics wrong!



A new life -

More and more, I'm sure,

As I go through life,

Just to play the game -,

And to pursue life -

Just to share its pleasures,

And belong! -

That's what I've been here for,

All along!

Each day's

A brand new life!
