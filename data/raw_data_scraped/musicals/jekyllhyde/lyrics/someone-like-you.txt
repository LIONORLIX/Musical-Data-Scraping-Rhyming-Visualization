Someone Like You


LUCY:

I peer through windows,

Watch life go by,

Dream of tomorrow,

And wonder "why"?



The past is holding me,

Keeping life at bay,

I wander lost in yesterday,

Wanting to fly -

But scared to try.



But if someone like you

Found someone like me,

Then suddenly

Nothing would ever be the same!



My heart would take wing,

And I'd feel so alive -

If someone like you

Found me!



So many secrets

I've longed to share!

All I have needed

Is someone there,



To help me see a world

I've never seen before -

A love to open every door,

To set me free,

So I can soar!



If someone like you

Found someone like me,

Then suddenly

Nothing would ever be the same!



There'd be a new way to live,

A new life to love,

If someone like you

Found me!



Oh, if someone like you

Found someone like me,

Then suddenly

Nothing would ever be the same!



My heart would take wing,

And I'd feel so alive -

If someone like you

Loved me...

Loved me...

Loved me!...
