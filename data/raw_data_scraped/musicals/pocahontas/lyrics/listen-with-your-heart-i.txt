Listen With Your Heart I


Voice of the Wind

Ay ay ay ya

Ay ay ya

Grandmother Willow

Que que na-to-ra

You will understand



Listen with your heart

You will understand



Let it break upon you

Like a wave upon the sand



Listen with your heart

You will understand



Voice of the Wind

You will understand ...
