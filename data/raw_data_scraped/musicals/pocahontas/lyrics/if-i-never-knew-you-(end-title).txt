If I Never Knew You (End Title)


[:Smith:]

If I never knew you

If I never felt this love

I would have no inkling of

How precious life can be



And if I never held you

I would never have a clue

How at last I'd find in you

The missing part of me



In this world so full of fear

Full of rage and lies

I can see the truth so clear

In your eyes

So dry your eyes



And I'm so grateful to you

I'd have lived my whole life through

Lost forever

If I never knew you



[:Pocahontas:]

If I never knew you

I'd be safe but half as real

Never knowing I could feel

A love so strong and true



I'm so grateful to you

I'd have lived my whole life through

Lost forever

If I never knew you



[:Smith:]

I thought our love would be so beautiful



[:Pocahontas:]

Somehow we made the whole world bright



[:Both:]

I never knew that fear and hate could be so strong

All they'd leave us where these whispers in the night

But still my heart is singing

We were right



[:Pocahontas:]

If I never knew you

If I never knew this love

I would have no inkling of

How precious life can be



[:Smith:]

There's no moment I regret

Since the moment that we met

If our time has gone too fast

I've lived at last...



[:Both:]

I thought our love would be so beautiful

Somehow we'd make the whole world bright



[:Pocahontas:]

I thought our love would be so beautiful

We'd turn the darkness into light



[:Both:]

And still my heart is singing

We were right



[:Smith:]

We were right

And If I never knew you

I'd have lived my whole life through



[:Pocahontas:]

Empty as the sky



[:Both:]

Never knowing why

Lost forever

If I never knew you
