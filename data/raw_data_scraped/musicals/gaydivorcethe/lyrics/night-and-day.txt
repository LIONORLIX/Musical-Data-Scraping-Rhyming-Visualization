Night and Day


VERSE

Like the beat beat beat of the tom-tom

When the jungle shadows fall,

Like the tick tick tock of the stately clock

As it stands against the wall,

Like the drip drip drip of the raindrops

When the sum'r show'r is through,

So a voice within me keeps repeating

You-You-You



Night and day you are the one,

Only you beneath the moon and sun,

Whether near me or far

It's no matter, darling, where you are,

I think of you, night and day.

Day and night, why is it so

That this longing for you follows wherever I go?

In the roaring traffic's boom,

In the silence of my lonely room,

I think of you, night and day.



Night and day under the hide of me

There's an, oh, such a hungry yearning

Burning inside of me,

And its torment won't be through

Till you let me spent my life making love to you

Day and night, night and day.
