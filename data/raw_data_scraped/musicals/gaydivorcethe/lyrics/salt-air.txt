Salt Air


He:

While I'm calmely sitting pretty,

In my office in the city,

Sentimental matters never seem to bother me.



She:

You've no need to be heroic,

When in town I'm such a soic

That I only want a man around to father me.



He:

Then explain, my dear, why is it,

When I even smell the sea,

I become so damned erotic,

If you knew me you'd agree.



She:

Do you suffer to surrender

To someone who's sweet and tender?



He:

Yes, I suddenly discover

I was born to be a lover.



She:

How exciting, how appealing,

I can understand that feeling,

For the ocean has the same effect on me.



Salt air,

Just a whiff of salt air,

And within me somewhere

Voices sing,

"You're all upset, go out and get that thing."

So swear,

To be perfectly square,

If I start a big love affair,

It's nobody's fault,

It's the fault of the salt air.



Salt air, it's a fact I can't explain

Just a whiff of salt air goes completely to my brain

And within me somewhere such inflammatory

Voices sing,

"You're all upset, go out and get that thing."

So swear by the dear old Pater's dust,

To be perfectly square, it's an effort but one must.

If I start a big love affair - love affair,

It's nobody's fault,

It's the fault of the salt air.
