Bohemians:

Flash! Aah!

Flash! Aah!

Flash! Aah!



Khashoggi:

Fear me you lords and lady preachers

I descend upon your Earth from the skies

I command your very souls you unbelievers

Bring before me what is mine

The seven seas of Rhye



Can you hear me you peers and privy councillors

I stand before you naked to the eyes

I will destroy any man who dares abuse my trust

I swear that you'll be mine

The seven seas of Rhye



Sister - I live and lie for you

Mister - do and I'll die

You are mine I possess you

I belong to you forever-ever-ever-aah



Storm the master-marathon I'll fly through

By flash and thunder-fire and

I'll survive - I'll survive - I'll survive

Then I'll defy the laws of nature and come out alive

Then I'll get you

Be gone with you - you shod and shady senators

Give out the good, leave out the bad evil cries

I challenge the mighty Titan and his troubadours

And with a smile

I'll take you to the seven seas of Rhye



Bohemians:

Oh, I do like to be beside the seaside

Oh, I do like to be beside the sea

There are lots of girls beside, oh I do like to be beside

Beside the seaside, beside the sea
