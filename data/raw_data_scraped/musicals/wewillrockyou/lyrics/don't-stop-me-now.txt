Don't Stop Me Now


Killer Queen:

Tonight! I'm gonna have myself a real good time

I feel alive

And the world is turning inside out

Floating around in ecstasy



Don't stop me now!



Don't stop me, 'cause I'm having a good time

Having a good time

I'm a shooting star leaping through the sky

Like a tiger, defying the laws of gravity
