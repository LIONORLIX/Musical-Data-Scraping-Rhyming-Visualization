Headlong


Meat:

And you're rushing headlong, you've got a new goal

And you're rushing headlong out of control



Brit:

And you think you're so strong

But there ain't no stopping and there's nothin'

You can do about it



Both:

Woo! There's nothin' you can do

No there's nothin' you can do about it



Brit:

No there's nothing you can



Galileo:

Nothing you can



Scaramouche:

Nothing you can



Meat:

Do about it



All:

And you're rushing headlong you've got a new goal

And you're rushing headlong out of control

And you think you're so strong

But there ain't no stopping



Galileo & Scaramouche:

And there's nothing you can do about it



Meat:

He used to be a man with a stick in his hand



All:

Oop diddy diddy, oop diddy doo



Brit:

She used to be a woman with a hot dog stand



All:

Oop diddy diddy, oop diddy doo



Meat:

Now you've got soup in the laundry bag



Brit:

Now you've got strings, you're gonna lose your rag



Meat:

You're gettin' in a fight and it ain't so groovy



Brit:

When you're screaming in the night

Let me out of this cheap B-movie



All:

Headlong down the highway

And you're rushing headlong out of control

And you think you're so strong

But there ain't no stopping



Meat:

And you can't stop rockin'



All:

And there's nothin' you can, nothin' you can

Nothin' you can do about it



Galileo:

When a red hot man meets a white hot lady



All:

Oop diddy diddy, oop diddy doo



Scaramouche:

Soon the fire starts to burn and gets 'em more than half crazy



All:

Oop diddy diddy, oop diddy doo



Galileo:

Oh, now they start freaking everywhere you turn

You can't start walking 'cos your feet got burned



Meat:

It ain't no time to figure wrong from right

Cause reasons out the window, better hold on tight



All:

Headlong down the highway

And you're rushing headlong, out of control

And you think you're so strong

But there ain't no stopping and there's



Brit:

Nothing



Meat:

Nothing



Galileo:

Nothing



Scaramouche:

Nothing



All:

Nothing you can, nothing you can

Nothing you can do about it

Headlong!
