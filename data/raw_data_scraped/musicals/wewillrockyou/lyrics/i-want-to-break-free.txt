I Want to Break Free


Galileo:

I want to break free

I want to break free

I want to break free from your lies

You're so self satisfied I don't need you

I've got to break free

God knows God knows I want to break free



I've fallen in love

I've fallen in love for the first time

In love with a world that's real

I've fallen in love yeah

God knows God knows I've fallen in love



It's strange but it's true, hey!

I know I'm different, there's so much I have to do

But I have to be sure

When I walk out that door

Oh how I want to be free baby

Oh how I have to be free

Oh how I want to break free



This existence is wrong

I can't get used to living without living without

Living without hope

It's all a lie

I don't want to live alone

God knows got to make it on my own

So people can't you see

God knows I've got to break free

God knows I need to

God knows I want to break free
