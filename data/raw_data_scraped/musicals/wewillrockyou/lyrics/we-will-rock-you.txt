We Will Rock You


Galileo:

Buddy, you're a boy

Make a big noise

Playing in the street

Gonna be a big man some day

You got mud on your face

You big disgrace

Kicking your can all over the place



Buddy, you're a boy

Make a big noise

Playing in the street

Gonna be a big man some day

You got mud on your face

You big disgrace

Kicking your can all over the place



We will, we will rock you

We will, we will rock you

We will, we will rock you



Buddy, you're a boy

Make a big noise

Playing in the street

Gonna be a big man some day

You got mud on your face

You big disgrace

Kicking your can all over the place



All:

We will, we will rock you

We will, we will rock you



Galileo:

Buddy, you're a young man, hard man

Shouting in the street

Gonna take on the world some day

You got blood on your face

You big disgrace

Waving your banner all over the place



All:

We will, we will rock you

We will, we will rock you



Galileo:

Buddy, you're an old man, poor man

Pleading with your eyes

Gonna make you some peace some day

You got mud on your face

You big disgrace

Somebody better put you back into your place



All:

We will, we will rock you

We will, we will rock you

We will, we will rock you

We will, we will rock you
