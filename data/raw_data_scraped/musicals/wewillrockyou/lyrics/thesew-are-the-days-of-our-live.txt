Thesew Are the Days of Our Live


Pop:

Sometimes I get to thinking

I was back in the old days, long ago

When we were kids, when we were young

Things seemed so perfect then - you know?

The days were endless

We were crazy, we were young

The sun was always shining

We just lived for fun

Sometimes it seems like lately - I just don't know

The rest of my life's been just a show



Pop & Bohemians:

Those were the days of our lives

The bad things in life were so few

Those days are all gone now but one thing remains



Pop:

When I look and I find no change



You can't turn back the clock, you can't turn back the tide

Ain't that a shame?

I'd like to go back one time on a roller coaster ride

When life was just a game

No use in sitting and thinkin' on what you did

You can lay back and enjoy it through the kids

Sometimes it seems like lately - I just don't know

Better sit back and go with the flow



Pop & Bohemians:

These are the days of our lives

They've flown in the swiftness of time

These days are all gone now but one thing remains



Pop:

When I look and I find

Hope still survives

Oh yeah
