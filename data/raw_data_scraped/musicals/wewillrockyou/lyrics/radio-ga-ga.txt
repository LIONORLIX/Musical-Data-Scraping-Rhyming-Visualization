Radio Ga Ga


Teachers and Kids:

We sit alone and watch your light

Our only friend, through teenage nights

And everything we want to get

We download from the internet



No need to think, no need to feel

When only cyberspace is real

It makes us laugh

It makes us cry

It makes us feel like we can fly

(Globalsoft)



Hope to record our life online

Touch any key, the world is mine

We're lost in space

But we don't care

Without your light our world's not there



Complete control, you are the power

Our lives are programmed by the hour

Globalsoft (Globalsoft)



All we hear is radio Ga Ga

Video Goo Goo

Internet Ga Ga

All we hear is cyberspace Ga Ga

Marketing Blah Blah



Always something new

Globalsoft, all your world loves you



We watch our shows

We watch your stars

Across our screens for hours and hours

We hardly need our eyes or ears

We just log on and dreams appear

(Globalsoft)



We're not alone

We have our friends

On cyber love we can depend

So stick around cos we'd all miss you

We need our graphics

Need our visual



Complete control, you are the power

We use our lives up by the hour

Globalsoft (Globalsoft)



All we hear is radio Ga Ga

Video Goo Goo

Internet Ga Ga

All we hear is cyberspace Ga Ga

Marketing Blah Blah



Always something new

Globalsoft, all your world loves you

Loves you
