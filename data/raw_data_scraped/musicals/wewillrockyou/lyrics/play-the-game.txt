Play the Game


Killer Queen:

Open up your mind and let me step inside

Rest your weary head and let your heart decide

It's so easy when you know the rules

It's so easy all you have to do is fall in love

Play the game

Everybody play the game of love



When you're feeling down and your resistance is low

Take a cyber-shopping trip and let yourself go

Give me your life

Don't play hard to get

It's a free world

All you have to do is fall in love

Play the game

Everybody play the game of love



My game of love has just begun

Love runs from my head down to your toes

My love is pumping through your veins

(Play the game)

Driving you insane

Come, come, play the game

Play the game, play the game, play the game



This is your life - don't play hard to get

It's a free free world

All you have to do is fall in love

Play the game

Everybody play the game of love



Of love, of love, of love, of love
