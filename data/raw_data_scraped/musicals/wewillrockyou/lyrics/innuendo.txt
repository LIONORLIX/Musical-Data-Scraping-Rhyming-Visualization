Innuendo


While the sun hangs in the sky and the desert has sand

While the waves crash in the sea and meet the land

While there's a wind and the stars and the rainbow

Till the mountains crumble into the plain



Oh yes we'll keep on tryin'

Tread that fine line

Oh we'll keep on tryin yeah

Till the end of time

Till the end of time

Till the end of time
