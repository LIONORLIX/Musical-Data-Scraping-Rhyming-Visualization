Who Wants to Live Forever


Scaramouche:

There's no time for us

There's no place for us

What is this thing that builds our dreams

Yet slips away from us



Who wants to live forever



Both:

Who wants to live forever

Who



Galileo:

There's no chance for us

It's all decided for us

This world has only one sweet moment set aside for us



Who wants to live forever



Both:

Who wants to live forever

Who

Who dares to love forever



Galileo:

Oh, when love must die!



Scaramouche:

But touch my tears with your lips



Galileo:

Touch my world with your fingertips



Both:

And we can have forever

And we can love forever



Galileo:

Forever is ours today



Both:

Who wants to live forever

Who wants to live forever



Scaramouche:

Forever is ours



Galileo:

Who waits forever, anyway?
