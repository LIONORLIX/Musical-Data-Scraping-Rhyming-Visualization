Hammer to Fall


Galileo:

Here we stand or here we fall

History won't care at all

Wake the dead, fight the fight

Lady Mercy won't be home tonight



Both:

You don't waste no time at all



Galileo:

Don't hear the bell but you answer the call



Both:

It comes to you as to us all



Scaramouche:

You're just waiting for the hammer to fall



Hey!



Galileo:

Hey!



Scaramouche:

Yeah!



Galileo:

Yeah, the hammer to fall!



Scaramouche:

Every night, and every day

A little piece of you is falling away

But lift your face, the western way, babe

Build your muscles as your body decays



Both:

Toe your line and play their game



Scaramouche:

Let the anaesthetic cover it all



Both:

Till one day they call your name



Galileo

You know it's time for the hammer to fall

Hey! The hammer to fall!



Scaramouche:

Rich or poor or famous

For your truth it's all the same

Lock your door but rain is pouring

Through your windowpane

Baby now your struggle's all in vain



Both:

What the hell we fighting for?



Galileo:

Just surrender and it won't hurt at all



Both:

You just got time to say your prayers

While you're waiting for the hammer to, hammer to fall

The hammer to fall

Hey? Yeah?

The hammer to, hammer to, hammer to fall



Galileo:

Give it to me one more time!



Scaramouche:

In your dreams, mate.
