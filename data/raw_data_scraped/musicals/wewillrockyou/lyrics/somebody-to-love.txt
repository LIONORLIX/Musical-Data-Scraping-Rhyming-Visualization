Somebody to Love


Scaramouche:

Can anybody find me somebody to love?



Each morning I get up I die a little

Can barely stand on my feet (take a look at yourself)

Take a look in the mirror and cry (and cry)

Lord, what you doing to me

I spent all my years to believe in you

But I just can't get no relief, Lord

Somebody (somebody), ooh somebody (somebody)

Can anybody find me somebody to love



Scaramouche (& GaGas):

I work hard (she works hard)

Every day of my life

I work till I ache in my bones



At the end (at the end of the day)

I take home my broken heart all on my own

I get down (down) on my knees (knees)

And I start to pray (praise the lord)

Till the tears run down from my eyes (oooh)

Oh somebody (somebody), ooh somebody (somebody)

Can anybody find me somebody to love



Everyday (everyday)

I try and I try and I try

But everybody wants to put me down

They say I'm going crazy

They say I got a lot of water on my brain

I got no common sense

I got nobody left to believe

Yeah!



Got no feel, I got no rhythm

I just keep losing my beat (You just keep losing and losing!)

I'm OK, I'm all right (she's ok - she's all right)

And I ain't gonna face no defeat

I just gotta get out of this prison cell (prison cell)

One day I'm gonna be free, Lord!



(Find me somebody to love

Find me somebody to love

Find me somebody to love

Find me somebody to love

Find me somebody to love)



Find me, find me oh...



(somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody

Somebody find me somebody to love)



Can anybody find me somebody to love

Somebody to love!
