One Vision


Consumers:

One plan, one goal

One mission

No heart, no soul

Just one solution

One flash of light

Yeah, one God, one vision

One flesh, one bone

One true religion

One voice, one hope

One real decision

Wowowowowowo

Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah



Galileo (v/o):

I had a dream when I was young



Scaramouche (v/o):

A dream of sweet illusion



Galileo (v/o):

A glimpse of hope and unity



Scaramouche (v/o):

And visions of one sweet union



Bohemians (v/o):

But a cold wind blows

And a dark rain falls

And in my heart it shows

Look what they've done to my dreams



Consumers:

One vision

Give us your hand, give us your heart

Ready? There's only one direction

One world, one nation

One television



No hate, no fight

Just excitation

All through the night

It's a celebration

Wowowowowowo yeah

One one one one one one one



All we hear is radio Ga Ga

Video Goo Goo

Internet Ga Ga

All we hear is cyberspace Ga Ga

Internet Ga Ga

Marketing blah-blah

Oh, oh!



One flesh, one bone

One true religion

One voice, one hope

One real decision



Give us one light, yeah

Give us one hope, hey

Just give us

One plan, one scam

One star, one night, one day, hey hey

Just gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme

Fried chicken

(vision, vision, vision, vision, vision)
