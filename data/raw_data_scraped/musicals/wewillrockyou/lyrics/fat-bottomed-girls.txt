Fat Bottomed Girls


Are you gonna take me home tonight?

Oh, down beside that red firelight;

Are you gonna let it all hang out?

Fat bottomed girls,

You make the rockin' world go round.



Hey

I was just a skinny lad

Never knew no good from bad,

But I knew life before I left my nursery,

Left alone with big fat Fanny,

She was such a naughty nanny!

Hey big woman you made a bad boy out of me!

Hey hey!



I've been singing with my band

Across the water, across the land,

I seen ev'ry blue eyed floozy on the way, hey

But their beauty and their style

Went kind of smooth after a while.

Take me to them lardy ladies every time!



(C'mon)

Oh won't you take me home tonight?

Oh down beside your red firelight,

Oh and you give it all you got

Fat bottomed girls you make the rockin' world go round

Fat bottomed girls you make the rockin' world go round



Hey listen here,

Now I got mortgages on homes

I got stiffness in my bones

Ain't no beauty queens in this locality. (I tell ya!)

Oh, but I still get my pleasure

Still got my greatest treasure.

Heap big woman you done made a big man of me!

Now get this!



Oh, (i know) you gonna take me home tonight (please)

Oh, down beside that red firelight

Oh, you gonna let it all hang out

Fat bottomed girls you make the rockin' world go round

Fat bottomed girls you make the rockin' world go round

GET ON YOUR BIKES AND RIDE!



Oooh yeah oh yeah them fat bottomed girls

Fat bottomed girls

Yeah, yeah, yeah,

Fat bottomed girls

Yes yes
