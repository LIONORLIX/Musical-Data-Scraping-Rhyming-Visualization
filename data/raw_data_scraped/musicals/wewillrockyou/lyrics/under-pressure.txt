Under Pressure


Galileo & Scaramouche:

Pressure! Pushing down on me

Pressing down on you, no man ask for

Under pressure



Galileo:

That brings a building down

Splits a family in two

Scaramouche:

Puts people on streets

Um ba ba be

Um ba ba be



Galileo:

De day oh

Ee day oh



Scaramouche:

That's okay



Galileo:

It's the terror of knowing what this world is about



Scaramouche:

Watching some good friends screaming



Both:

Let me out!



Galileo:

Pray tomorrow gets me higher



Both:

Pressure on people, people on streets



Galileo:

Day day de mm hm

Da da da ba ba



Scaramouche:

Okay



Galileo:

Chippin' around - kick my brains around the floor

These are the days it never rains but it pours

Ee do ba be

Ee da ba ba ba

Um bo bo

Be lap



People on streets - ee da de da de

People on streets - ee da de da de da de da



It's the terror of knowing

What this world is about

Watching some good friends screaming



Both:

Let me out!



Galileo:

Pray tomorrow gets me higher and higher



Scaramouche:

Pressure on people, people on streets



Both:

Turned away from it all like a blind man

Sat on a fence but it don't work



Galileo:

Keep coming up with love but it's all slashed and torn



Scaramouche:

Why - why - why?

Love love love love



Galileo:

Insanity laughs under pressure we're cracking



Scaramouche:

Can't we give ourselves one more chance



Galileo:

Why can't we give love that one more chance



Scaramouche:

Why can't we give love, give love, give love, give love

Give love, give love, give love, give love, give love



Galileo:

'Cause love's such an old-fashioned word



Both:

And love dares you to care for

The people on the edge of the night

And loves dares you to change our way

Of caring about ourselves

This is our last chance

This is our last dance



Galileo:

This is ourselves



Scaramouche:

Under pressure



Both:

Under pressure

Pressure
