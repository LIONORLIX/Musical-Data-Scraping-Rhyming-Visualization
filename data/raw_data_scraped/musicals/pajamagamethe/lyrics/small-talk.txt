Small Talk


(Sid)

I don't want to talk small talk

Now that I'm alone with you

I don't want to talk small talk

We've got bigger things to do

Let's not talk of the weather

Or the fashions for the fall

Why don't you stop all this small talk?

I've got something better for your lips to do

And that takes no talk at all



(Babe)

I've got to buy me a dressy dress, the one that I have is such a mess!



(Sid)

Small Talk!



(Babe)

Who will you vote for next election,

How do you like the stamp collection?



(Sid)

Small Talk!



Read in a book the other day that halibut spawn in early may and horses whinney and donkeys bray and furthermore, the pigmy

tribes in Africa may have a war.



(Babe)

No?



(Sid)

Yes!

I don't want to talk small talk



(Babe)

What do you think they charge for ham now?



(Sid)

Now that I'm alone with you



(Babe)

Got so a buck ain't worth a damn now



(Sid)

I don't want to talk small talk



(Babe)

Read where the winters are getting milder



(Sid)

We've got better things to do



(Babe)

And that the teenage kids are wilder



(Sid)

Let's not talk of the weather



(Babe)

One of these days I'm gonna paint the kitchen



(Sid)

Or the fashions for the fall



(Babe)

Get pop to put a new light switch in



(Sid)

Why don't you stop all that small talk



(Babe)

Like I was saying...



(Sid)

I've got something better



(Babe)

What I mean is...



(Sid)

For your lips



(Babe)

I was only...



(Sid)

...to do
