Seven-And-A-Half Cents


(Prez)

I figured it out

I figured it out

With a pencil and a pad I figured it out!

Seven and a half cents doesn't buy a hell of a lot,

Seven and a half cents doesn't mean a thing!

But give it to me every hour,

Forty hours every week,

And that's enough for me to be living like a king!

I figured it out



(chorus)

He figured it out!



(Prez)

I figured it out



(Chorus)

He figured it out!



(Prez)

With a pencil and a pad I figured it out!

Only five years from today!

Only five years from today!

I can see it all before me!

Only five years from today!

Five years! Let's see..thats 260 weeks, times forty hours every week, and roughly two and a quarter hours overtime.. at time

and a half for overtime! Comes to exactly.. $852.74!

That's enough for me to get

An automatic washing machine,

A years supply of gasoline,

Carpeting for the living room,

A vacuum instead of a blasted broom,

Not to mention a forty inch television set!



(Chorus)

So! Although!

Seven and a half cents doesn't buy a hell of a lot,

Seven and a half cents doesn't mean a thing!

But give it to me every hour,

Forty hours every week,

And that's enough for me to be living like a king!



(Babe)

I figured it out



(Chorus)

She figured it out!



(Babe)

I figured it out!



(Chorus)

She figured it out!



(Babe)

Only ten years from today,

Only ten years from today,

I can see it, clear as daylight,

Only ten years from today!

Ten years! Let's see..thats 520 weeks, times forty hours every week, and roughly two and a quarter hours overtime.. at time

and a half for overtime! Comes to exactly.. $1705.48!

That's enough for me to buy

A trip to France across the seas,

A motorboat and water skis,

Maybe even a foregian car,

A charge account at the corner bar,

Not to mention a scrabble board with letters made of gold!



(Chorus)

So! Although!

Seven and a half cents doesn't buy a hell of a lot,

Seven and a half cents doesn't mean a thing!

But give it to me every hour,

Forty hours every week,

And that's enough for me to be living like a king!



(Babe and Prez)

We figured it out!



(Chorus)

They figured it out!

They figured it out!



(Babe and Prez)

We figured it out!



(All)

With a pencil and a pad they figured it out



(Babe)

Only twenty years from today



(Prez)

Only twenty years from today



(Babe)

I can see it like a vision



(All)

Only twenty years from today



(Prez and Babe)

Twenty years! Let's see..thats 1040 weeks, times forty hours every week, and roughly two and a quarter hours overtime.. at

time and a half for overtime! Comes to exactly.. $3411.96!

Wow!



(Prez)

That's enough for me to be

A sultan in a taj mahal

In every room a different doll!



(Babe)

I'll have myself a buying spree,

I'll buy a pajama factory,

Then I could end up having old man Hasler work for me!



(Chorus)

So! Although!

Seven and a half cents doesn't buy a hell of a lot,

Seven and a half cents doesn't mean a thing!

But give it to me every hour,

Forty hours every week,

And that's enough for me to be living like a king!
