Racing With the Clock (Reprise)


Girls



When you're racing with the clock

When you're racing with the clock

And the second hand doesn't understand,

That your back may break

And your fingers ache,

And your constitution isn't made of rock



(repeat)

It's a losing race when you're racing with the,

Racing with the clock.
