Her Is


Prez: I wouldn't never tell this to nobody else but you,

To nobody else but you I wouldn't never tell this,

What I mean to say is, you're different from the rest,

Baby, you're the best



And I wouldn't never tell this

To nobody else

But you!

Gladys: Aw go on! Ha ha ha!

Prez: Ha ha ha!

Gladys: Ha ha ha!

Prez: Ha ha ha!



Her is a kinda doll what drives a fellow bats, isn't her?

Gladys: Her is

Prez: Her has a kinda shape what really is the cats, hasn't her?

Gladys: Her has

Prez: My wife, she ain't understandin'

She ain't like her is!

This here ain't no line I'm handin'

Or I should drop dead right where I'm standin'



Her is a snappy dresser what is dressed to kill, isn't her?

Gladys: Her is

Prez: Her is the only doll from which I get a thrill, isn't her?

Gladys: Her is

Prez: Her is runnin' away but her sure can bet

Him is gonna get her yet

I'm gonna get her yet!



Gladys: Ha ha ha!

Prez: Ha ha ha!
