Hey There (Reprise)


SID



Better forget her,

Her with her nose in the air.

She has you dancing on a string,

Break it and she won't care.

Will you take this advice I hand you like a brother,

Or are you not seeing things too clear?

Are you too much in love to hear.

Is it all going in one ear and out the other?
