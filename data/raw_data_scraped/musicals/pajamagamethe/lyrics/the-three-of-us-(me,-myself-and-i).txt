The Three of Us (Me, Myself and I)


The three of us have fallen in love

Me myself and I

The three of us are fighting for your kisses

Me myself and I

And if we struggle to the death to gain your favor

Not one of us will ever give in

The three of us have fallen in love

And may the best man win



The three of us have fallen in love

Me myself and I

The three of us are fighting for your kisses

Me myself and I

And if we struggle to the death to gain your favor

Not anyone of us will ever give in

The three of us have fallen in love

And may the best man win



I’ll never never never never… never be jealous again



And if we struggle to the death to gain your favor

Not anyone of us will ever give in

The three of us have fallen in love

And may the best man win
