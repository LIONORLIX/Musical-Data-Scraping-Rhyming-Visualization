I'm Not at All in Love


Babe:

All you gotta do is say hello to a man

And they've got you whispering in his ear



All you gotta is be Polite with him

And they've got you spending the night with HIM



If there's a guy you merely have a bicker with

They've got you setting the wedding date



It seems they've just gotta have some dirt

To bend your ear with



So before you start

I hear with...state



I'm not, at all in love, not at all in love, not I!

Not a bit

Not a might

Though I'll admit he's quite a hunk a guy



But he's not, my cup of tea, not my cup of tea, not he!

Not an ounce

Not a pinch

He's just an inch, too sure of himself for me



Girl: Well of course you've noticed his manly physique and that look in his eye

Girl: Well I'm sure he can cut almost any man out of size!

Girl: He must he as fierce as a tiger when he's mad

Girl: And I'll bet he cries like a little boy when he's sad



Babe: But I'm not at all in love, not at all in love not I!

Not a straw

Not a hair

I don't care if he's as strong as a lion

Or if he has the rest of you sighing

You may be sold but this girl aint buying!!

I'm not at all in love!



Girls: She's not at all in love, not at all in love, oh no



Babe: Not a pin, not a crumb



Girls: Must be the summer heat that gives her that glow

Cuz she's not at all in love, not at all in love, she cries!



Babe: Not a snip, not a bite

Girls: Must be the light from the ceiling shining there in her eyes

He's young and handsome, and smart, and we can't get over it



Babe: but this ladies heart he doesn't effect a bit



Girls: It's easy to see that her daffy grin is a grin she always wears

And she's breathless because she ran up a flight of stairs!



Girls: "obviously"

"naturally"

"Certainly"

"naturally"

"Certainly"

Ha!

She's not at all in love, not at all in love, not she



Babe: No I'm not!



Girls: Not a dot



Babe: Not a touch



Girls: No not much



Babe: When I fall in love, there will be no doubt about it

Cuz you will know by the way that I shout it



Girls (softly): Your shouting



Babe (softly): I haven't fallen



Girls: she hasn't fallen



Babe: I'm not at all in love!

Girls( pick up when she says at): She's not at all in love!
