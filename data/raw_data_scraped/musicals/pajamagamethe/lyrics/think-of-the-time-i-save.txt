Think of the Time I Save


Hinesy:

I'm a time study man, and a time study man can't waste time.

For a time study man to waste time,is a crime.

So i'm ruled by the tick tick tock.

And i live my life by the clock.

I live my life by the tick tick tock of the clock.



Ihen i go to sleep, I don't undress.

That's right, I sleep in all my clothes.

I must confess.

Sure it's a strange way to behave.

And I will admit that the suit gets mussed and it gathers lint and it picks up dust,

but think of the time I save.



Girls:

Think of the time he saves.



Hines:

The alarm clock rings, it's 6 AM.

And then right there in bed I shave.

That's what I said. while I am still in bed, I shave.

And the lather drips and the bed gets wet and oh what a lousy shave I get,

But think of the time I save.



Girls:

Think of the time he saves.



Hines:

At breakfast time, I grab a bowl.

And in the bowl I drop an egg, and add some juice.

A poor excuse for what I crave.

And then I add some oatmeal too and it comes out tasting just like glue,

But think of the time I save.



Girls:

Think of the time he saves.

Tick tock, tick tock, tempus fugit.

Tick tock, tick tock time goes by.



Hines:

I'll be sitting counting seconds til the day I die.

And when I do, I have a plan.

Before I'm dead, I'll dig my grave.

That's what I said. Before I'm dead I'll dig my grave.

'Cuz when St. Peter calls my name,

I know I'll get there just the same but think of the time I'll save.



Girls:

Think of the time he'll save.
