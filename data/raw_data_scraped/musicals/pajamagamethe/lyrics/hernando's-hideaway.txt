Hernando's Hideaway


I know a dark secluded place.

A place where no one knows your face.

A glass of wine a fast embrace.

It's called Hernando's Hideaway ole!

All you see are silohuettes.

And all you hear are castanetts.

And no one cares how late it gets.

Not at Hernando's Hideaway ole!

:::Instrumental:::

At the golden fingerbowl or any place you go.

:::Instrumental:::

You'll meet your uncle Max and everyone you know.

:::Instrumental:::

But if we go to the spot that I am thinking of

You will be free, to gaze at me, and talk of love.

Just knock three times and whisper low, that you and I were sent by Joe.

Then Strike a match and you will know your in Hernando's Hideaway OLE!
