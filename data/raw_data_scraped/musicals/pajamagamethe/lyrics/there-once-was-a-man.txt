There Once Was a Man


There once was a man who loved a woman

She was the one he slew a dragon for

They say that nobody ever loved as much as he-ee

But me-ee

I love you more.



(BABE: Tell me!)



And there once was a man who loved a woman

She was the one he gave his kingdom for

They say that nobody ever loved as much as he-ee

But me-ee

I love you more



My love is a giant, fierce and defiant

But how can I prove it to you?

Ain't got no kingdom or dragon

To back up my braggin'

How can I show what I would do?



I only know there once was a man

Who loved a woman

She was the one he ate the apple for

They say that nobody ever loved as much as he-ee

But me-ee, I love you more



BABE:There once was a woman who loved a man

He was the one that she took poison for

They say that nobody ever loved as much as she-ee

But me-ee, I love you more



And there once was a woman who loved a man,

He was the one she swam the channel for

They say that nobody ever loved as much as she-ee

But me-ee, I love you more.



My love's meteoric, it's merely historic

A whirlwind, a cyclone on wheels

It rocks my whole solar plexus,

It's bigger than Texas

I just can't tell you how it feels

I only know there once was a woman

Who loved a man

Loved him enough to cause the Trojan War

They say that nobody ever loved as much as she-ee

But me-ee,

I love you more! more! more! more!



More than a hangman loves his rope

More than a dopefiend loves his dope

More than an Injun loves his scalps

More than a yodeler loves his alps

More More More more more!
