The World Around Us


The world around us is trying to tear us apart

But let’s let them know they’re trying in vain

Alone we each may wind up the loser

Together we’ve so much to gain

The love that found us may not be a storybook romance

We’ve had our ups and downs

But let’s not complain

Just come to my arms and know we’ve got nothing to fear

And let the world around us disappear



The love that found us may not be a storybook romance

We’ve had our ups and downs

But let’s not complain

Just come to my arms and know we’ve nothing to fear

And let the world around us disappear
