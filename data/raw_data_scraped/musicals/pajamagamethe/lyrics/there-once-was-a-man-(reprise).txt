There Once Was a Man (Reprise)


BABE



More than lion loves her cub



SID



More than a limey loves his pub



BABE



More than a flounder loves his fin



SID



More than a guzzler loves his gin

More



BABE

More,



SID

More,



BABE

More,



SID

More,



BABE

More,



SID

More,

There once was a man,



BABE

There once was a woman



SID

Who loved a woman



BABE

Who loved a man



SID

She was the one he

Slew the dragon for



BABE

He was the one that

She took poison for!



SID

They say that no-

body ever loved



BABE

They say that no-

body ever loved



SID

As much as he-ee,

But me-ee,



BABE

As much as she-ee,

But me-ee,



SID

I love you more.

But me-ee,

I love you more!



BABE

I love you more

But me-ee

I love you more!
