Dispensable


What hurts the most

is knowing that I love you more

than you love me.

So there's nothing I can do,

though you say it isnt' true.

You wont have a discussion,

and you know the repercussions.

All of your reasons,

are easily defensible.

So you can cleanly walk away from me,

I guess I'm now dispensable



What hurts the most

is packing up a box of things

that once belonged to us.

Is the T.V. yours or mine?

Are you already feeling fine?

I don't know what you're thinking,

I start slipping and keep sinking.

I try to understand it,

but it's just incomprehensible.

The one that you once loved is now alone,

accepting he's dispensable.



Show me, feel something.

Let yourself scream.

Prove that this  is harder for you

than you make it seem.

While I'm shattered,

you act happy to be free.

Say I mattered as much to you,

as you always will to me.



I hope that I wont have to wait to heal.

Until you feel as broken as I feel.



What hurts the most,

is watching you be done with me,

when I'm not done with you.

What will you tell your friends?

Is this how it really ends?

You're adjusted and collected,

all together uneffected.

You found your solution,

you always were so sensible.

You never opened up enough to hurt.

And dared to be...

Dispensable
