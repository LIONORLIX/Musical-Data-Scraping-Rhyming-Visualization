I Hmm You


MALE

It's an awkward situation,

since we don't know what we are.

Since I don't know what you want for me to be,

and amiss the complication.

You just fell into my arms, but it's new and you're not comfortable with me.

And it's not that I just like you,

But I don't know if I love you, so I made a little phrase I hope will do.

Since there's more then there was yesterday, but less then when tomorrow comes,

for today we both can say: ?I hmm you.?



WOMAN

(spoken) Are you serious?!



MALE

(spoken) listen-

(sung) I hmm the way you get defensive in the morning,

you won't smile 'til eleven though I look at you adoringly.

You seem to blame for the sunlight that is

pouring through the window while snoring, but at least you're never boring.



WOMAN

I hmm the face you make whenever you mid-rial, when you argue just to argue,

when you're acting like a child. I hmm the way you sing with thick in your lump,

how you burn anything you cook, how you get anything, you're strong.



BOTH

I hmm how the whole world seems to freeze. When I look at you, I lose all feeling in my knees.



WOMAN

I hmm your silly, boyish antics.



MALE

I hmm when you're corny and romantic.



BOTH

I hmm all the crazy things you do, I hmm getting to know you. I really hope you hmm me too.



WOMAN

I hmm the poker face you make when you're all bluff,

the way you talk about your mom, when you say that I'm enough.



MALE

I hmm the way your smile curves just to the right,

the way we swoon and cuddle up, how we can never stay in line.



BOTH

I hmm how the whole world seems to freeze.

When I look at you I lose all feeling in my knees.



WOMAN

I hmm how your eyes look greenish-blueish.



MALE

I hmm how you like that I look Jewish.



BOTH

I hmm all the crazy things we do, oh what a beautiful you! I really hope you hmm me too.

(hmms)

You're the one whose always there when the push comes to the shove.

You are everything I wanted, you're beyond me you're above. And when I close my eyes, it's

you I'm dreaming of. I think that you're the girl/boy who I was meant to.....hmm.



WOMAN

You're ready and I'm ready.



MALE

If you'll say it then I'll say it.



WOMAN

If you thinks it's more then hmm-ing,



BOTH

Don't be bashful and delay it. I think that I could be in love, I really hope you love me too!



MALE

Oh I love you!



WOMAN

I love you too!



BOTH

Ohh (hmms)
