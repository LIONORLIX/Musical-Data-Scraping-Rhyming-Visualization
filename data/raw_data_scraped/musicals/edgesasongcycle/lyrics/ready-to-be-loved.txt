Ready to Be Loved


I think I've worked it out

I think at last the cloud has moved aside

I've spent a lifetime waiting

Awoke today to find my arms are open wide

There comes a point when things aren't clear

Then they shift into perspective

All hesitation seems to disappear



I know I've found the way

I've finally found the way to let things go

The past is there to teach you

Mistakes provide the pain that helps you grow

So I have healed and I have grown

At some point I guess you have to

BUt I don't want to face the world on my own



Something has got to start

I am ready to be loved

Someone come steal my heart

I am ready to be loved

I know you'll find me it takes time

Today I know that I'm ready to be loved



I won't depend on you

I want comfort; I don't need a crush

I need to care for someone

And know that someone out there cares for me as much

I'm on a search for something great

I won't settle for contentment

Though I am willing to, I don't want to wait



Something has got to start

I am ready to be loved

Someone come stewal my heart

I am ready to be loved

I know you'll find me it takes time

Today I know that I'm ready to be loved



I was always the girl who thought she needed to be tough

I was never the girl who liked herself enough

To feel like she deserved someone who cares

But now I do, yes I do

I'm prepared
