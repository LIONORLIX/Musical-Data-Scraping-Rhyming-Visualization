Coasting


It's you again and I can think of nothing to say

You're beautiful, that's why I'm a new guy every day

I act like someone else

Like who you want me to be

I'm everyone but me



They say "Just be you, you don't need to try so hard"

OK, sure, that's true

But I can't let down my guard

Why can't I be the guy who is real

No bullshit ideal

Or layers to peel away

A wall goes up and all I think to say is



"Hello, hi, how are you?

You look great today"

And "Hey, what's new?"

And "That's so true"

And "Oh my god, no way"

"Hello, hi, how are you?"

Every line is staged

The same ordeal, don't think or feel

But seem like you're engaged



And on and on I rummage through my vault of used up sayings

But I'm praying I'll find something that has meaning at its core

'Cause really what's the point if we're just coasting on the surface?

We are capable of finding, saying, feeling so much more

But we're just coasting



Tight jeans, low cut shirt

A vintage bottle of wine

Toss hair, start to flirt

Relax, your ass looks fine

Tell stories, fill up space

Pretend to laugh at your flaws

Avoid the awkward pause



They say "Just be you, you don't need to try so hard"

OK, sure, that's true

But I can't let down my guard

And when my mouth starts to move

I get in this groove

Please someone approve of me



"Hello, hi, how are you?

You look great today"

And "Hey, what's new?"

And "That's so true"

And "Oh my god, no way"







"Hello, hi, how are you?"

Speak but never think

"Hah, hah, hah"

And "Blah, blah, blah"

And grab another drink



And on and on I rummage through my vault of used up sayings

But I'm praying I'll find something that has meaning at its core

'Cause really what's the point if we're just coasting on the surface?

We are capable of finding, saying, feeling so much more

But we're just coasting

Coasting



Why do I laugh at jokes that I don't get?

Why do I say things I know I'll regret?

Why do I care so much about my weight?

Why am I friends with people whom I hate?



Why do I cover up all my imperfections?

Why do I lie so much?

Why do I try so much?

Why am I afraid to make connections?



"Hello, hi, how are you?

You look great today"

And "Hey, what's new?"

And "That's so true"

And "Oh my god, no way"

"Hello, hi, how are you?"

Speak but never think

"Hah, hah, hah"

And "Blah, blah, blah"

And never stop to blink



And on and on I rummage through my vault of used up sayings

But I'm praying that I'll find some sort of substance and connect

'Cause really what's the point if we're just coasting on the surface?

If we take a moment we'll begin

To find and say and feel

We can discover something real

If we are willing to reflect

But we're just coasting

Coasting
