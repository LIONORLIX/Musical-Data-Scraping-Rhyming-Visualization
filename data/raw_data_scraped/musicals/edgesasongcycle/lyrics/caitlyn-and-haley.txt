Caitlyn and Haley


HALEY

Caitlyn is growing

She grew two inches just last year

Mom says Caitlyn`s becoming a woman

Caitlyn got louder

She`s always talking on the phone

Caitlyn wears earrings and lipstick

Caitlyn got a cell phone

Caitlyn got a license

Caitlyn got a boyfriend

Caitlyn gets everything



Caitlyn won`t play with me anymore

Like she used to

Won`t help me with my homework

Like she did before she grew

Caitlyn tells stories that aren`t true



She told mom she was sleeping over at Julie`s

But I saw her go out with that slimy guy

With hair allover his face

Caitlyn`s now friends with the bullies

Who in middle school she swore forever to hate

Caitlyn is bad now



Caitlyn is stealing mom`s money

Caitlyn won`t laugh at my jokes anymore

Caitlyn says I am not funny

And Caitlyn is dressing like a whore



Caitlyn is growing

I saw her smoke a cigarette

Mom says, `Caitlyn`s becoming a woman`

But if Caitlyn is a woman

I don`t wanna be a woman quite yet



CAITLYN

Haley`s a baby

She hasn`t started puberty

Haley is stealing my sport`s bras

Haley`s flat-cheasted

She`s always looking through my drawers

Haley is still wearing scrunchis

Haley got annoying

Haley`s gotten younger

Haley`s gotten needy

Haley wants everything



Haley is mad I moved out of room

I put my stuff in the attic

Haley just cries when she can`t get her way

She`s way too dramatic

Haley says I act erratic

She probably got that from mom



She`s always acting mean to my boyfriend

She locks herself up in her room

Whenever he comes by

Haley won`t ride in my car now

She says it smells way too smokey inside



Haley is acting like a baby

She has no friends but mom and dad

Haley loves sharing my secrets

And telling on me when I do something bad



Haley`s a baby

Was I that young at her age`

I tell all my friends

She`s just going through a stage



BOTH

I wish Caitlyn(Haley) would stop(start) growing



HALEY

I wish Caitlyn still played foursquare



CAITLYN

I wish Haley did her hair



BOTH

I wish



HALEY

Caitlyn didn`t date those guys



CAITLYN

I wish Haley didn`t cry so much



HALEY

I wished Caitlyn move back in



CAITLYN

I wish Haley had tough skin



BOTH

I wish I had my sister back

My stupid, ugly sister back

We stop ourselves then get real fat

Sneak down the stairs for a midnight snack

I hope we`re on an upward track

I`ll sign a form

I`ll make a pact

She`ll make up all the parts I lack

If I can have my sister back
