Chitty Flies Home (Finale)


There you are, you see, a happy ending, hooray!

We're all together again, you can go home now

But we don't want to, but she does, we'll be fine

Now we're together, stand clear please

Stand well back, stand clear, thank you, stand well back



Oh you, pretty Chitty Bang Bang

Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, we love you

And in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang

Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, what we'll do

Near, far, in our motor car, oh what a happy time we'll spend



Bang Bang, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang

Our fine four fendered friend

Bang Bang, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang

Our fine four fendered friend



Chitty Bang Bang, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang

Chitty Bang Bang, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang

Chitty Bang Bang, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang



Chitty Bang Bang, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang

Chitty Bang Bang, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang

Chitty Bang Bang, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang

Oh yes, go, go



Oh you, pretty Chitty Bang Bang

Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, we love you

And in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang

Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, what we'll do

Near, far, in our motor car, oh what a happy time we'll spend



Bang Bang, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang

Our fine four fendered friend

Bang Bang, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang

Our fine four fendered friend



You're sleek as a thoroughbred

Your seats are a feather bed

You'll turn everybody's head today



We'll glide on our motor trip

With pride in our ownership

The envy of all we survey



I'll get you children, just you wait and see

I'll get you

Now will you marry me?

Well, that wouldn't be entirely inappropriate

What? Yes, hooray!



Oh you, pretty Chitty Bang Bang

Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, we love you

And Chitty, our Chitty, pretty Chitty Bang Bang

Chitty Chitty Bang Bang loves us too

High, low, anywhere we go, on Chitty Chitty we depend



Bang Bang Chitty Chitty Bang Bang

Our fine four fendered friend

Bang Bang Chitty Chitty Bang Bang

Our fine four fendered friend
