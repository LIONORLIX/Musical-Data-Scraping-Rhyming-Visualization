Chu-Chi Face


You're my little chu-chi face

My coo-chi, coo-chi, woo-chi little chu-chi face

Every time I look at you I sigh

And you're my little teddy bear

My lovey lovey dovey little teddy bear

You're the apfel strudel of mine eye

Your chu-chi woo-chi nose

Your chu-chi woo-chi eyes

They set my heart a flutter

Your ooo-chi coo-chi ways

Your ooo-chi coo-chi gaze

Wilts me down like meltings butter

You're my little chu-chi face

And you're my teddy bear

Together we're a chu-chi woo-chi, ooo-chi coo-chi pair

Whatever you may ask becomes my happy task

I only live to serve you

I never will divine what magic made you mine

I only know I don't deserve you

You're my little chu-chi face

And you're my teddy bear

Together we're a chu-chi woo-chi, ooo-chi coo-chi

Chu-chi, Woo-chi, Ooo-chi, Coo-chi pair

Chu-chi

Woo-chi

Ooo-chi

Coo-chi pair
