Think Vulgar!


VULGARIAN SPY 1

You have a Vulgar mind,

You have a Vulgar heart,

You have Vulgar blood

You are Vulgar through and through,

So when in doubt:

Think Vulgar, and fall in line.

VULGARIAN SPY 2

Think Vulgar

VULGARIAN SPY 1

and you'll be fine

Just remember all Vulgarian sons and daughters

are expendable, unless they follow orders.

VULGARIAN SPY 2

Think Vulgar and show no fright

VULGARIAN SPY 1

Think Vulgar will all your might

VULGARIAN SPY 2

Day und Night

VULGARIAN SPY 1

Be obedient and behave

just like a vulgar slave

Or you'll wind up

In a Vulgar Grave

If you don't want thumb-screws

or the torture rack,

Just speak English

VULGARIAN SPY 2

Jolly good

VULGARIAN SPY 1

And tally-ho

If we should fail

There is no turning back

We'll both be mincemeat

And six feet below

VULGARIAN SPY 2

don't want to go below

VULGARIAN SPY 1

So act English, stiff upper lip

VULGARIAN SPY 2

Stiff upper lip

VULGARIAN SPY 1

So act English, Cheerio Pip-pip

VULGARIAN SPY 2

Cheerio Pip-pip

VULGARIAN SPY 1

If we should fail to get that car

as we've been ordered

VULGARIAN SPY 2

In Vulgaria we'll both be drawn and quartered

VULGARIAN SPY 1

Think Vulgar, be slick and sly,

You're a spy

Think Vulgar or else we die

VULGARIAN SPY 2

Else we die

BOTH

Be obedient and behave just like a Vulgar slave

VULGARIAN SPY 1

Or we'll wind up

VULGARIAN SPY 2

Wind up

VULGARIAN SPY 1

Wind up

VULGARIAN SPY 2

Wind up

VULGARIAN SPY 1

Where the guns are lined up

VULGARIAN SPY 2

Lined up

VULGARIAN SPY 1

Lined up

VULGARIAN SPY 2

Lined up

VULGARIAN SPY 1

To a post you're twined up

VULGARIAN SPY 2

Then what?

VULGARIAN SPY 1

You're shot

BOTH

In a Vulgar grave

A Vulgar grave
