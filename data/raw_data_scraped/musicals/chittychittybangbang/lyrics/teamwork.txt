Teamwork


CARACTACUS:

One way, I know of one way, Lets unite and right this wrong.

One way, theres only one way, we must form a fighting throng.

If the same great dream is beating in each heart,

there's no stopping what a fighting team can start.

For all together, a team can weather, any storm they may go through.

Yes, teamwork, can make a dream work,

can make the greatest dreams come true.



CHILDREN:

Maybe, with some surprises, we could even fight a plight.

Right. Maybe, despite our sizes, we could win the day, tonight. Right!

If our hearts and hands, team up and fight as one,

we won't stop until the victory is won!



CARACTACUS:

When you're united, a torch is lighted, the golden flame of liberty.



ALL:

Yes teamwork can make a dream work and we'll stand tall, and proud, and free.



CARACTACUS:

Thesere's that spark of a dream in every one of you.

It's the dreamof freedom that your hearts desire.

Though one tiny little spark, can barely make a mark,

all together many sparks can light a mighty fire!



All:

Teamwork, can make a dream work, if we all pitch in and try.

Teamwork can make a dream work, and no mountain is to high!

If the same great dream, is beating in each heart,

there's no stopping what a fighting team can start.

For, all together, a team can weather, any storm they may got through.

Yes, teamwork, can make a dream work

can make the greatest dreams come true.

Teamwork can make a dream work if you're not afraid to fight.

Teamwork can make a dream work, if you fight for what is right.

Though it seems a dream's impossible to do,

great teams make it's possibilities come true.

So when you start out, let all your heart out.

And we won't stop what we begin!

Yes, teamwork can make a dream work if we have got the will to win.

Yes, teamwork, can make a dream work if we have got the will to win!
