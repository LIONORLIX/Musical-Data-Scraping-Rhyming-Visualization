Finale Act 1 (Chitty Takes Flight)


{Come on, come on, they're getting away

They're making for the coast, yes, we've got to catch them

Hang on grandpa, faster daddy faster

Faster Chitty, please}



{Daddy, yes Jemina

What does beachy head mean?

Beachy head, it's just a beach

No, no it's a head, straight ahead Mr Paul

Look out look out we're going over the cliff}



{Help help, please Chitty help us, please

What

Look, [Incomprehensible]

Vow daddy vow}



Oh you pretty Chitty Bang Bang

Chitty Chitty Bang Bang we love you

And, in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang

Chitty Chitty Bang Bang what we'll do



Near, far in our motor car

Oh what a happy time we'll spend



Bang Bang Chitty Chitty Bang Bang

Our fine four fendered friend

Bang Bang Chitty Chitty Bang Bang

Our fine four fendered friend
