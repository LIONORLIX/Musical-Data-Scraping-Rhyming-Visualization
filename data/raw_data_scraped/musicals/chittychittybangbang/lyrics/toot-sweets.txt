Toot Sweets


Caractacus:

Don't waste your pucker on some all day sucker

And don't try a toffee or cream

If you seek perfection in sugar confection

Well there's something new on the scene

A mouth full of cheer

A sweet without peer

A musical morsel supreme!

Toot Sweets!

Toot Sweets!

The candies you whistle, the whistles you eat.

Toot Sweets!

Toot Sweets!

The eatable, tweetable treats!



Truly:

Toot Sweets!

Toot Sweets!

The toot of a flute with the flavor of fruit!

Toot Sweets!

Toot Sweets!

No longer need candy be mute!



Caractacus:

Don't waste your pucker on some all day sucker



Truly:

and don't try a toffee or cream!

If you seek perfection in sugar confection,



Caractacus:

well, there's something new on the scene:



Truly:

that mouth full of cheer;



Caractacus:

that sweet without peer;



Both:

That musical morsel supreme!

Toot Sweets!

Toot Sweets!

A bon-bon to blow on at last has been found

Toot Sweets!

Toot Sweets,

with tweetable, eatable sound!



Scrumptious:

No--take it away!



Truly:

Father, please! (he takes one)

Toot! Hmm-Hmm. Toot! Laughter from Truly and her father. (He takes a bite)



Caractacus:

He likes it!



Cast:

Hooray!



Caractacus:

Their value is intrinsic,



Truly:

surpass any mint stick



Kids:

Or marshmallow mouthful you munch



Caractacus:

Though licorice is chewy



Truly:

And gum drops are gooey



Kids:

And chocolate is charming to crunch



Caractacus and Truly:

That savory fife,



Women:

that sweet of your life



Kids and factory workers:

It's clearly the best of the bunch.



(Dance break)



All:

Toot Sweets!

Toot Sweets!

Toot Sweets!

Toot Sweets!



Caractacus:

That savory fife



Truly:

That sweet of your life



All:

Is clearly the best of the bunch

Toot Sweets!

Toot Sweets!

A bon-bon to blow on at last has been found

Toot Sweets!

Toot Sweets!

The treat that's so tweetable,

lusciously eatable,

with that unbeatable--(break) sound!
