Come to the Funfair


CALLER

Come to the Funfair

CAST (OVERLAPPING)

So close your eyes on Hushabye Mountain,

wave goodbye to cares of the day

and watch your boat from Hushabye Mountain

Sail far away

CALLERS (OVERLAPPING)

Come to the Funfair

Come to the Funfair

CAST

To the Funfair

MALES

Come to the Funfair

FEMALES

Come to the Funfair

ALL

Fall into line

FEMALES

Come to the Funfair

Come to the Funfair

MALES

Come to the Funfair

ALL

Twinkle and Shine

Take a ride on a merry Roundabout

Sail a dreamboat across the lagoon

Go around until you reel on the Ferris wheel

Or fly, fly, fly in a toy balloon

Why don't you come to the Funfair, Fall into line

Come put a smile on, Twinkle and Shine

Come to the Funfair, follow the throng

Everyone's there, at the Funfair

Come along

MALES

Everyone's there

WOMEN

Everyone's there

ALL

At the Funfair.

Come along, come along, come along to the Funfair!
