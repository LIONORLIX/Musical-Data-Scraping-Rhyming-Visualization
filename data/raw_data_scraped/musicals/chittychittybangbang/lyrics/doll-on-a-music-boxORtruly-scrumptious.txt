Doll on a Music Box/Truly Scrumptious


What do you see

You people gazing at me

You see a doll on a music box

That's wound by a key

How can you tell

I'm under a spell

I'm waiting for love's first kiss

You cannot see

How much I long to be free

Turning around on this music box

That's wound by a key

Yearning

Yearning

While

I'm turning around and around

What do you see

(Truly Scrumptious)

You people gazing at me

(you're truly truly scrumptious)

You see a doll on a music box, that's wound by a key

(scrumptious a...)

How can you tell I'm

(whe...)

Under a spell I'm

(...)

Waiting for love's first kiss

(honest truly, your the answer to my wishes)

You cannot see

(Truly Scrumptious)

How much I long to be free

(though I may seem presumptuous)

Turning around on this music box that's wound by a key

(ne..)

Yearning

(my heart beats so unruly)

Yearning

(because I love you truly)

While I'm turning around and around)

(honest, Truly I do)
