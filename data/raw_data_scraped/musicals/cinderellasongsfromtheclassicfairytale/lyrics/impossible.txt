Impossible


(Godmother)

Impossible, for a plain yellow pumpkin to become a golden carriage.

Impossible, for a plain country bumpkin and a prince to join in

Marriage,

And four white mice will never be four white hosrses!

Such fol-der-ol and fid-dle-dy dee of course, is--- Impossible!

But the world is full of zanies and fools

Who don't believe in sensible rules

And won't believe what sensible people say.

And because these daft and dewey-eyed dopes keep building up impossible

Hopes,

Impossible things are happening every day.



(Cinderella)

Impossible!



(Godmother)

Impossible!



(Cinderella)

Impossible!



(Godmother)

Impossible!



(Cinderella)

Impossible!



(Godmother)

Impossible!



(Both)

Impossible!





(Cinderella)

It's Possible! For a plain yellow pumpkin to become a golden carriage!

It's Possible! For a plain country bumpkin and a prince to join in

Marriage!



(Godmother)

And four white mice are easily turned to horses!

Such fol-der-ol and fid-dle-dy dee of course, is

Quite Possible! It's possible!



(Cinderella)

For the world is full of zanies and fools



(Godmother)

Who don't believe in sensible rules



(Cinderella)

And won't believe what sensible people say



(Both)

And because these daft and dewey-eyed dopes keep building up Impossible

Hopes

Impossible things are happening every day!



(Cinderella)

It's Possible!



(Godmother)

It's Possible!



(Cinderella)

It's Possible!



(Godmother)

It's Possible!



(Cinderella)

It's Possible!



(Godmother)

It's Possible!



(Both)

It's Poss-i-ble
