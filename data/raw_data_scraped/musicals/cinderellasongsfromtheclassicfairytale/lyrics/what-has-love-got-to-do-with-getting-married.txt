What Has Love got To Do With Getting Married


What has love got to do with getting married?

Why should love enter into it at all?

Love can make you quite emotionally harried when you're married

It's pedantic and romantic falderal

Find a mate, dear boy, find a mate

Princess Susan, Princess Karen, Princess Kate

Find a mate, dear boy, find a mate

Love will have to wait



What has love got to do with being married?

Being married is a problem all it's own

Love is highly overrated and makes marriage complicated

When the bed is elevated to the throne



Find a mate, dear boy, find a mate

Pick the proper princess, prime to propagate

Find a mate, dear boy, find a mate

Love will have to wait



There is many an eligible maiden

Of good family with title of her own

Who would come to us bountif'ly beladen

With an army that could fortify our throne



What has marriage got to do with being happy?

Being married can't compare with being royal

Being royal you engender every luxury and splendor

While a marriage can get overripe and spoil



Find a mate, dear cousin, set the date

Why procrastinate and stay the hand of fate?

Find a mate, dear cousin, set the date

Happiness can always wait
