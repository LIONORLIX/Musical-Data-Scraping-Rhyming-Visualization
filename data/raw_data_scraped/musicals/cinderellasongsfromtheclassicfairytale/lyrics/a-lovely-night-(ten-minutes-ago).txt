A Lovely Night (Ten Minutes Ago)


(Prince) Ten minutes ago I saw you

I looked up as you came through the door

My head started reeling,

You gave me the feeling

The room had no ceiling or floor



Ten minutes ago I met you

And we murmured our 'how-do-you-dos'

I wanted to ring out the bells

And fling out my arms

And sing out the news



I have found her,

She's an angel

With the dust of the stars in her eyes

We are dancing, we are flying

And she's taking me back to the skies!



In the arms of my love, I'm flying

Over mountain and meadow and glen

And I like it so well

That for all I can tell

I may never come down again



I may never come down to earth again



(Cinderella) Ten minutes ago I saw you

You looked up as I came through the door

My head started reeling,

You gave me the feeling

The room had no ceiling or floor



Ten minutes ago I met you

And we murmured our 'how-do-you-dos'

I wanted to ring out the bells

And fling out my arms and sing out the news



I have found him

(Prince: I have found her)

He's the dust of the stars in my eyes

We are dancing, we are flying

And he's taking me back to the skies!



In the arms of my love, I'm flying

Over mountain and meadow and glen

And I like it so well that for all I can tell

I may never come down again



I may never come down to earth again.





"A Lovely Night"





(Cinderella):

A Lovely night, a lovely night

A finer night you know you'll never see

You meet your Prince, a charming Prince

As charming as a Prince will ever be.

The stars in a hazy heaven tremble above you

While he is whispering:

"Darling I Love you"

You say good-bye, away you fly

but on your lips you keep a kiss

All your life you dream of this

Lovely, lovely night.



(Stepsister):

A lovely night, a lovely night!

A finer night you know you'll never see



(Stepsister):

You meet your prince, a charming prince



(Together)

As charming as a prince will ever be



The stars in a hazy heaven

Tremble above you

As he's whispering, "Darling, I love you"



You say goodbye, away you fly

But on your lips he leaves a kiss

All your life you dream of this

Lovely, lovely night!
