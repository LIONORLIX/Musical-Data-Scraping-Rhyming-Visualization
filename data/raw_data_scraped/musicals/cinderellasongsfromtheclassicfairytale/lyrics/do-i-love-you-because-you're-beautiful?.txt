Do I Love You Because You're Beautiful?


Prince:

Do I love you because you're beautiful,

or are you beautiful because I love you?

Am I making believe I see in you a girl too lovely to be really true?

Do I want you because you're wonderful,

or are you wonderful because I want you?

Are you the sweet invention of a lover's dream

or are you really as beautiful as you seem?



Cinderella Musical:

Am I making believe I see in you a man too perfect to be really true?

Do I want you because you're wonderful,

or are you wonderful because I want you?



Both:

Are you the sweet invention of a lover's dream

or are you really as wonderful as you seem?
