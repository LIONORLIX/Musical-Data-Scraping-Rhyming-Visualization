The Stepsisters' Lament


Why would a fellow want a girl like her?

A frail and fluffy beauty?

Why can't a fellow ever once prefer

a solid girl like me?!



She's a frothy little bubble

with a flimsy kind of charm

And with very little trouble

I could break her little arm!



Oh oh why would a fellow want a girl like her?

So obviously unusual?

Why can't a fellow ever once prefer

a usual girl like me?!



Her face is exquisite I suppose,

but no more exquisite than a rose is.

Her skin may be delicate and soft

but not any softer that a doe's is.



Her neck is no longer that a swan's

She's only as dainty as a daisy

She's only as graceful as a bird...

So why is the fellow going crazy?



Oh why would a fellow want a girl like her,

A girl who's merely lovely?

Why can't a fellow ever once prefer

a girl who's merely me?!



She's a frothy little bubble

with a frilly sort of air

and with very little trouble

I could pull out all her hair!! Haha ha ha!



Why would a fellow want a girl like her,

a girl who's merely lovely?

Why can't a fellow ever once prefer

a girl who's merely me?



What's the matter with the man?

What's the matter with the man?

What's the matter with the man?!
