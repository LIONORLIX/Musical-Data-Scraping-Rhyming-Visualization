Refugees


Clopin and Refugees:

We are the strangers here, the refugees the women and men.

Without a home, Oh Notre dame we come and ask of you.

Asylum. Asylum.



We are the strangers here, the refugees the women and men.

Without a home, Oh Notre dame we come and ask of you.

Asylum. Asylum.



At Paris gates we stand, ten thousand in our band.

And one day soon we'll be, a million in this land.

We wonder what you'll do, the day we ask of you.

Asylum. Asylum.



We are the strangers here, the refugees the women and men.

Without a home, Oh Notre dame we come and ask of you.

Asylum. Asylum.



We are the down-and-outs, here at the city gates.

And all of Paris waits, to see what we're about.

The world will change someday; We'll make it work someway.

The day we come to stay, with you.



We are the strangers here, the refugees the women and men.

Without a home.

We are the strangers here, the refugees the women and men.

Without a home.

The refugees.

Without a home.



We are the strangers here, the refugees the women and men.

Without a home.

We are the strangers here, the refugees.

We are the strangers here, the refugees the women and men.

Without a home.



We are the strangers here, the refugees the women and men.

Without a home, Oh Notre dame we come and ask of you.

Asylum. Asylum.



We are the strangers here, the refugees the women and men.

Without a home, Oh Notre dame we come and ask of you.

Asylum. Asylum. Asylum. Asylum.
