Master And Saviour


Quasimodo:

Frollo, my master my saviour, my priest of Jesus here.

You have a heart that cares.



Frollo:

A heart.



Quasimodo:

A heart that love can heal.



Frollo:

A heart that tears can chill.

Quasimodo:

A heart that still can feel



Frollo:

A heart that had to kill.



Frollo:

Look over there! Your sweet Esmeralda!

Do you recall Quasimodo, when she was dancing there down on the square?

I sent her to the scaffold, don't you see?

For she would not give her love to me.



Quasimodo:

You have done this, you!



Frollo:

On a cross like our Jesus she'll die!



Quasimodo:

Nooo!



Frollo:

Look over there, the hangman awaits.

For the gypsies cry.

Your Esmeralda, its her that will hang.

When the sun starts to rise!

Ha ha ha ha!



Quasimodo:

Frollo!
