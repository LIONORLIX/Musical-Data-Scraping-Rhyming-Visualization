Free Today


Quasimodo & Refugees:

Free today. Flown away. Souls at bay find a way.

I've set them free today; souls at bay find a way.

Free today (hear us pray).

Souls at bay (find a way).

Facing plague (who will pay).

Seize the day (whole worlds sway)

Free today (hear us pray).

Souls at bay (find a way).

Facing plague (who will pay).

It's our day (souls that pray)



Quasimodo:

When they were locked away.

I opened up the bars.

Now they are free today.

They're free to see the stars.



(Gringoire:

Hear our prayer asylum now)



(Free today, hear us pray.

Souls that may, find a way.

Facing plague, who will pay?

Seize the day, whole worlds sway)

Esmeralda:

Light of day, light our way.

Light of day, come and stay.
