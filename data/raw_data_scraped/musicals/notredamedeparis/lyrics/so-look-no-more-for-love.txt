So Look No More For Love


Fleur-de-Lys:

My tender years I bring here to you, like diamonds on a string all for you.

Just promise anything, anything I'll believe it's true



Phoebus:

Your heart say's it is time for us two, your eyes look into mine and I'm through.

Not all the stars that shine will outdo, the diamonds they're in you.



Fleur-de-Lys:

The man I've come to love, this handsome cavalier.

Won't know how I can love, until I hold him near.



Phoebus:

You say that I don't know, but when you look at me.

Your eyes have such a glow; I know how it will be.



Fleur-de-Lys:

So look no more for love.



Phoebus:

Love is you.



Fleur-de-Lys:

Love's all I am made of.



Phoebus:

Oh so true.



Fleur-de-Lys:

The sun will shine above on our love the day I marry you.



Phoebus:

I'll find you in the night, when all the moonlight streams.

Will cover you in light, and I will touch my dreams.



Fleur-de-Lys:

And all the words you'll say, will fill my heart with fire.

As night turns into day, I'll do all you desire.



Phoebus & Fleur-de-Lys:

So look no more for love, love is you.

Loves all I am made of, Oh so true.

The sun will shine above on our love the day I marry you.

The sun will shine above on our love the day I marry you.

The day I marry you.
