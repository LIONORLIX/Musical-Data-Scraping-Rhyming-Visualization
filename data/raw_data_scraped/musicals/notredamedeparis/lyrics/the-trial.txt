The Trial


Frollo:

Esmeralda this high court charges you,

with having wounded a soldier true.



Esmeralda:

If he is wounded he's living still,

oh let me see him one time if the court will.



Frollo:

You have seduced him with foul sorcery,

stabbed him to kill him it's plain to see.



Esmeralda:

It wasn't me on my soul I swear.



Frollo:

But you were alone with him in his bed there.



Esmeralda:

There's a priest out of hell, who followed me.

Out of the night he came, can't you see.



Frollo:

This girl has all these wild imaginings.

She always thinks she is seeing crazy things.



Esmeralda:

I think he looks a lot like you sir.



Frollo:

See how the devil looks out of her eyes.

She is a stranger, a sorceress;

she is a pig, she is a bohemienne.



Did you commit this crime, and do you now confess.



Esmeralda:

I am the victim here, I can say no more or less.
