At Val d'Amour


Grengoire:

Upon the streets of St Denis

There is a place for you and me.

And when it gets to dark to see,

Look for the lights, knock on the door.

If you have loving on your mind,

This is the place you have to find.

You will be back time after time,

Back to the house called Val d'amour.



At Val d'amour they close the door,

They give you what you're looking for.

No pretty words no diamond rings,

But you can buy most anything.

Just pay the price and love is yours,

Behind the doors of Val d'amour.

From every corner of the world,

They come to take their choice of girls.

The captain's and the sailor boys,

They come to find their little joys.

No matter what the tongue they speak,

Their money talks week after week.



Ladies of love my heart is sore,

I am Gringoire the troubadour.

I'm sick with love you have the cure

Behind the doors at Val d'amour.

Guitars implore come one come all,

Come take your tour of Val d'amour.

At Val d'amour they play a part,

Give them your money not your heart.

Beneath the sheets your love will flower,

It'll last the night or last an hour.



Phoebus:

When sick with love I know the cure,

I take a trip to Val d'amour.

It takes all night, but be assured

They get it right at Val d'amour.

Mesdemoiselles excusez-moi,

I'll wait for my Esmeralda.

She read her fate here in my hand,

Tonight she'll make me understand.



Grengoire:

Just north of Paris on the square,

Off Popincourt you'll find us there.

The lowlifes come from everywhere,

Oh nothings pure at Val d'amour.

And gentlemen in courtly dress,

They fall in drunk and make a mess.

At Val d'amour we close the door,

And give you what you're looking for.

No pretty words no diamond rings,

But you can buy most anything.

Just pay the price and love is yours,

Behind the doors of Val d'amour.

Behind the doors of Val d'amour.

Behind the doors of Val d'amour.
