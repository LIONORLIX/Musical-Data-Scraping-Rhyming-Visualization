This Small Whistle I Leave You


Quasimodo:

You're as still afraid of me as I can see.



Esmeralda:

No I hope you are my friend until the end.



Quasimodo:

This small whistle I'll leave so you can call on me.



Esmeralda:

Day's I'll hide from the light, but will you let me walk around at night?



Quasimodo:

On the roof of my Notre dame for you the stars will come.

You have nothing to fear; you know I'll be near.



Esmeralda:

If you see my Phoebus out there, will you let him know I'm here?



Quasimodo:

Esmeralda when sleep has come, do you still see your shining sun?
