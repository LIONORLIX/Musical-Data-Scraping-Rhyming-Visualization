Shining Like The Sun


Esmeralda:

He is shining like the sun, born of kings a royal one.

I feel love awaken me, deep down in me too strong for me.

In his hand I saw the line that told me this man is mine.

This man, is mine.



Fleur-de-Lys:

He is shining like the sun, but he's tough as anyone.

When I'm in his soldier's arms, I want to run, but he's too warm.

Close to him I feel so fine, my heart knows that he is mine.

This man, is mine.



Esmeralda & Fleur-de-Lys:

He is shining like the sun, he's my dream my only one.

He'll protect me all my life, I'll be so proud to be his wife.

He is shining like the sun, he's my dream my only one.

He is shining like the sun, shining like the sun.
