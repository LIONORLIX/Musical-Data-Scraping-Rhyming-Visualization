By Royal Law


Phoebus:

By Royal law this is way the judgement falls.

Hear one and hear all.

Esmeralda you will die today for making foul sorcery.

As for you refugees, you are all.

Deportez.

Exilez.

Cast away.

Deportez.

Exilez.

Cast away.

Deportez.

Exilez.

Cast away.

(Deportez.

Exilez.

Cast away.)
