Live for the One I Love


Esmeralda:

A million stars light, this beautiful night.

This is not a night to die, let me sing and dance.

Beneath the sky.

I have such love to give, to give.

I want a chance to live.



Live for the one I love.

Love, as no one has loved.

Give, asking nothing in return.

Free, free to find my way.

Free to have my say.

Free to see the day.

Be, like I used to be.

Like a wild bird free.

With all the love in me.



Live for the one I love.

Love, as no one has loved.

Give, asking nothing in return.



Though this world tears us apart.

We're still together in my heart.

I want the world to hear my cry.

And even if I have to die.

Love will not die.

Love will change the world.



Live for the one I love.

Love, as no one has loved.

Give, asking nothing in return.



I'll love, until love wears me away.

I'll die, and I know my love will stay.

And I know my love will stay.
