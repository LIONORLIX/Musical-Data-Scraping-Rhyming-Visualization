The Bells (opening part)


Gringoire:

The bells do not play, in Notre dame today.

Quasimodo hides up above, Quasimodo is sick with love.



Frollo:

The bells have lost their voice, for three days by his choice.

Quasimodo is sad, Quasimodo is going mad.



Frollo & Gringoire:

Quasimodo dies for love.
