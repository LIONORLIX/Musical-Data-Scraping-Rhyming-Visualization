Water please


Frollo:

Hunchback cripple, you are to blame.

Ringer of bells you bear the shame.

Pray for his soul this child of sin.

God in your mercy, take him in.



Quasimodo:

Someone take pity on Quasimodo, the weight of the world brings him low.

Does no one listen there, is there any water here, oh I need it so

I pray you, I pray.

Water please I pray.



Quasimodo:

Belle, belle.
