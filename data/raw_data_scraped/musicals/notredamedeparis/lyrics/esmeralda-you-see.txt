Esmeralda You See


Clopin:

Esmerada you see, you're no longer a child.

And this world is so wild, that you must hear me a little while.

You were not yet eight years, your mother died so young.

Still hearing as she died, Andalusia's song.



Esmeralda:

She left me here with you, and you watched over me.

Did all that you could do, to help me make it through.



Clopin:

Esmeralda you see, some men can hurt you so.



Esmeralda:

In the streets where I run, out there anything goes.



Clopin:

Do you understand me, and the things I speak of?

You are a child no more.

You've reached the age of love!



Esmeralda:

I've reached the age of love.
