Frollo's Intervention


Frollo:

Monsieur Phoebus de Chateaupers, captain of the archers of the crown.

I order you to arrest, these strangers disturbing the town.

Disperse now at any cost this rabble of the lost.

Who come to disturb the peace, All Paris demand they cease.



Phoebus:

At your order's monsignor Frollo. In god's name my men will strike a blow.

We'll clear this riff raff from your sight, these beggar thieves that live by night.



Phoebus:

Beautiful girl why are you here, is it from heaven you appear?

Paradise must be your home, you're like no one I've ever known.
