Bohemienne Song


Bohemienne.

No one knows where my story begins.

Bohemienne.

I was born on a road that bends.

Bohemienne, bohemienne.

Come tomorrow, I'll wander again.

Bohemienne, bohemienne.

Here's my fate in the lines of my hand.



When I was a child in Provence, Bare foot in the hills I danced once.

But the gypsy road is so long, the roads so long.

Everyday I see a new chance, maybe some road will lead from France.

I will follow till I come home, Till I come home.



Andalusia's streams, run through my blood, run through my daydreams.

Andalusia's sky, when it calls me, I feel my heart fly.



Bohemienne.

No one knows where my story begins.

Bohemienne.

I was born on a road that bends.

Bohemienne, bohemienne.

Come tomorrow I'll wander again.

Bohemienne, bohemienne.

Here's my fate in the lines of my hand.

Here's my fate in the lines of my hands.
