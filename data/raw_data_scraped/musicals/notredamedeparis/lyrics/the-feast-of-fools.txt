The Feast Of Fools


Gringoire:

and Ensemble.

The feast of fools, the feast of fools.

The feast of fools, the feast of fools.



I'll show you how to run, this noble feast of fool.

I know we'll have some fun, I'll show you all the rules.



The feast of fools, the feast of fools.



Pick out the ugliest, amongst the faces here.

The worst face is the best, the face that children fear.

Of all the ones who try, the one who make us sick.

From lips to nose to eye that's who we'll have to pick.



The king of fools, the king of fools.

That's who we'll have to pick, that's who we'll have to pick

The king of fools



The

Feast

Of

Fools



The feast of fools, the feast of fools.

The feast of fools, the feast of fools.

The feast of fools, the feast of fools.



Those eyes that nose so thick, that tongue that hangs and licks.

The face that makes us sick, that's who we'll have to pick.

The king of fools, the king of fools.

That's who we'll have to pick, that's who we'll have to pick.

The king of fools.



The ringer of the bells, that hump upon his back.

That face right out of hell, Quasimodo we like.

It's Esmeralda's name that makes his poor heart tick.

He's twisted deaf and lame that's who we'll have to pick



The king of fools, the king of fools.

That's who we'll have to pick, that's who we'll have to pick.

Quasimodo!



That's who we'll have to pick, that's who we'll have to pick.

The king of fools



That's who we'll have to pick, that's who we'll have to pick.

Quasimodo! The king of fools!
