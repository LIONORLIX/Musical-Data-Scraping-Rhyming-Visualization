To Get Back To You


Phoebus:

My heart was led away I knew no right from wrong.

The gypsy girl had made her magic strong.

I knew no night or day I lost my way back home.

I would have died if I'd stayed too long.

I, who hurt your heart I am not the same.

I'm down on my knees I accept the blame.

I've had time to heal my body and soul.

Tell me what to do to get back to you.

My heart was led away I knew no right from wrong.

The gypsy girl wanted gold for her song.

I knew no night or day I lost my way back home.

But here with you I am where I belong.

My heart was led away I knew no right from wrong.

The gypsy girl for her sins will be hung.

I've changed the night to day, I've found my way back home.

Deep in my heart I've loved you all along.

Please tell me what to do, to get back to you.
