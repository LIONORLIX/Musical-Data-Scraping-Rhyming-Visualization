The Torture


Frollo:

Torturer come, I'll ask her the question again.

She's only strong because there's a devil within.

Make her body feel the pain; only pain will bring the truth.

Do you confess?



Esmeralda:

I love him I confess.



Frollo:

You will have to die for your sin.



Esmeralda:

Assassins, Assassins!



Frollo:

Bohemienne, you have confessed to using magic.

To prostitution, and to attacking Phoebus de Chateaupers.

On the day appointed you will be led

From your cell to the Place de Greve

Where you will be hanged by the neck until dead.

May god have mercy on your soul.
