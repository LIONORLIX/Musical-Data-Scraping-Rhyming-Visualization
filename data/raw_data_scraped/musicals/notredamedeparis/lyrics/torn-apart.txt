Torn Apart


Phoebus:

Torn apart, I am a man divided.

Torn apart, I want two women's love.

Two women want my love; I don't know how to cut my heart in two.



Torn apart, I am a man in pieces.

Torn apart, I want two women's love.

Two women want my love, I'm just glad I have love enough for two.



One for the day, the other for the night.

One just for now, the other all my life.

One for always, until the end of time.

The other soon will find, my love won't stay.



Torn apart, I am a man in divided

Torn apart, I want two women's love.

Two women want my love, and they'll just have to love the man I am.



Torn apart, I am a man in pieces.

Torn apart, I want two women's love.

Two women want my love, is it my fault that I'm a normal man.



One's honey sweet, the other has a bite.

One's heaven sent, the other rules the night.

And to the one I swear my love is true.

And to the other one I break the rules.



Torn apart, I am a man divided.

Torn apart, I want two women's love.

Two women want my love; I don't know how to cut my heart in two.



Torn apart, I am a man divided.

Torn apart, I want two women's love.

Two women want my love; I don't know how to cut my heart in two.



Torn apart.

Torn apart.



Torn apart, I am a man in pieces.

Torn apart, I want two women's love.

Two women want my love, I'm just glad I have love enough for two.



Torn apart.

Torn apart.

Torn apart.
