I Chose Right


As I leave my single life behind

Thoughts are kind of spinning in my mind

First I think about you

And I think about me loving you

And I think about you and me deciding we could be one

It's crazy I know, I wrestle with my pillow all last night

And I look at you and I know I chose right

Life's a very long road

And the crossroads come up right away

And it's so hard to know which way to go when you've barely begun

And Oh, the road you leave behind can shine so bright

And I look at you and I know I chose right

Now maybe we don't mean that much you and I

And maybe our balloon will never fly

And maybe no one cares if we let things go by

And maybe doesn't matter if we live or die

But if I'm making promises to you today

I wanna know I keep them all the way

And if I've not been good at meaning what I say

It's time now to try

So I think about you and I think about me loving you

Then I think of my friends who'll say they're in love when they're

just havin' fun

But I say no no no if I am gonna love its with all my might

And I will be true, I will follow this through and I look at you?

And I know I chose right
