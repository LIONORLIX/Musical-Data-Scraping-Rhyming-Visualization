With You


I said I'd fill my life with you, one look and what else could I do. That smile that lights your face washed into every empty space and made me see a better me inside of me. And when a gift like that comes through I have to thank the stars forever. And so I'll stay with you and fill each day with you and always know that I'd complete in every way with you.



I said I'd fill my life with you, one look and what else could I do. It only took one touch and some how you unlooked and made me see a stronger me inside of me. And when a gift like that comes through I have to thank the stars forever.
