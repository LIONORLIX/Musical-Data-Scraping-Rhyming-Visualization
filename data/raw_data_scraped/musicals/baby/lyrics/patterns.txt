Patterns


Patterns in my life that I trace every day,

Patterns as I say the things I always say,

Patterns in the ceiling as I lie awake,

Why are patterns haunting every move I make?



Just look, here I am on cue, again.

Upset, feeling torn in two, again.

Afraid, saying I'm okay,

Making little jokes,

'Til I run away, again.



And yet today, I am not the same,

I feel my life slipping from its fame

Strange feelings rise, feelings with no name,

And I can't face them, so I shake them hard,

Fold them up,

And tuck them safely away,

Again.



Patterns that begin as I walk through a door,

Patterns in the curtains, and the kitchen floor,

Patterns in the day's routine I must arrange,

Patterns in the ways I try, but never change.



Just look, as I'm thrown a curve, again.

I leap, then I lose my nerve again.

In tears, running home I go,

Secretly relieved, safe with what I know,

Again.



And yet I know, I am not the same.

Inside my heart, there's something I can't tame.

I feel my mind, bursting into flames,

And I must change or else I'll break apart,

Or break away.

Or end up having to start,

Again.



Patterns in the day I seem to use to give my life a shape,

Patterns in the house that give me comfort when I need escape,

Patterns that leave me, nowhere

At all.
