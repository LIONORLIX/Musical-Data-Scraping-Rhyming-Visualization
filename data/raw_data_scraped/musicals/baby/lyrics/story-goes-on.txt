Story Goes On


So this is the tale my mother told me

That tale that was much too dull to hold me

And this is the surge and the rush she said would show

Our story goes on

Oh, I was young I'd forgot how things outlive me.

My goal was the kick that life would give me

And now like a joke something moves to let me know

Our story goes on

And all these things I feel and more

My mother's mother felt and hers before

A chain of life began upon the shore of some dark sea has reached to me

And now I can see the chain extending

My child is next in the line that has no ending

And here am I feeling life that her child will feel when I'm long gone

And thus it is our story goes on

And on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on

And all these things I feel and more

My mother's mother felt and hers before

A chain of life began upon the shore of some primordial sea has

stretched through time to reached to me

And now I can see the chain extending

My child is next in the line that has no ending

And her am I feeling life that her child will feel when I'm long gone

Yes all that was is part of me as I am part of what's to be

And thus it is our story goes on

And on and on and on and on
