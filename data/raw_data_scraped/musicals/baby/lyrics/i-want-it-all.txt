I Want It All


For a whole lotta years you could say I?ve been expecting

But I always made sure that I didn?t expect too much

I sat around on my potential

But now that I?ve heard this news

It?s released all these possibilities

And all I have to do is choose



I want it all

I want it all

I want the whole female experience in a ball

I want it all

I want the morning sickness and the elations

I want every known female sensation

I want to be Scarlett O?Hara, Joan of Arc, Lauren Bacall

I want it all



I?ve been sitting making decisions just like you have

So the thing that I did was to make myself a list

I put what I want on this side

And what I don?t want over here

It was quite a bout,

But I worked it out

And now the answer?s very clear



I want it all

I want it all

I want adventure, love, career, kids large and small

I want it all

I want a quiet simple life and some glory

And Steven Spielberg filming my first story

I want to be Gloria Steinam, Janice Joplin, Annie Hall

I want to be Catherine Hepburn, Connie Chung, Madame de Stae"l

I want to be Mother Teresa, Sally Ride, Lucille Ball

I want it all



Oh no

My friends

There?s now to ways to slice it

You must choose

My friends

And there are things you gain

But some you lose my friends

Some very lovely things

Like an overtone of romance

An element of surprise

The things any grown up practical woman gives up if she?s wise



I want it all

I want it all

There?s a rise up to the heights

And then a ball

I want it all

Don?t try to tell me that I can?t have my drama

And be a mother who is also a motha?

I wanna know that I can find inside me anyone I need

I wanna be Donna Mckechnie, Donna Summer, Donna Reed

I wanna be Margaret Sanger, Margaret Thatcher, Margaret Mead

I want it all

I want it all

I want to find a way to break through every wall

I want it all



I want Tahiti

I want a Grammy

I want stretch marks

I want a pedicure

I want dill pickles

I want Learjet

I want a string Bikini

I want the Nobel Prize

I want to make totem poles out of fruit cans

I want it all

I want it

I want it all

I want it

I want it all

I want it

I want it all

All

I could get into this
