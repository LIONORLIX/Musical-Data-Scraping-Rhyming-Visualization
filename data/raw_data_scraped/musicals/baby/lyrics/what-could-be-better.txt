What Could Be Better


LIZZIE

He'll maybe have my smile

And your hair

Who tell 'till the baby comes?



He'll maybe have my style

And your flair

And play fabulous drums



Just think:

Inside me our genes have found their niche

They link, and out'll come one tap dancing kid

With perfect pitch



What could be better than your own little clone

Who'll reproduce all your talents

Plus a hint of my own



Consider:

This kid could be a one man band if we let her



DANNY

Her?



LIZZIE

Your sense of key and my great vibrato

Your melody and my obligato

That's what we've got, oh,

What could be better than that?



Right, Danny? Danny? DANNY!



DANNY

I'm thinking...

I'm picturing my lips and your eyes



LIZZIE

For a boy that's a perfect pair



DANNY

I'm picturing my hips and your thights



LIZZIE

That is very unfair



DANNY

No, no, I know

No one can predict what bird we'll hatch

But we're such genetic gems

That God can mix and match



What could be better than if our little spawn

Got all his brains from his dad

And from his mom got his brawn?

Imagine what one tiny mix-up could net her



LIZZIE

Him



DANNY

Your button nose and my bushy eye-brown



BOTH

You for the low brow, me for the high brow

Your brow and my brow, what could be better than that?



DANNY

Hey, that's a good sound. Do it again!



BOTH

La, la, la, la...



DANNY

Uh, Liz... How come?



LIZZIE

I was careful, I swear it! I never forgot it! I don't know how it happened!



DANNY

Maybe it's just that no barrier on earth can stand up against the vigorous lashing army of my sperm!



LIZZIE

That mus be it...



Picture a flailing spermatozoan

Not even knowing where he is going

What's that ahead? A diaphragm! Screw it!

He knows he's dead. My god, he slips through it!



Suddenly he's alone in the river

Now he muyst seize the chance to deliver

Rounding the bend, the egg starts to glimmer

Is this the end for our little swimmer?



Catching the tide, he sails towards the mystery

Set to collide and change all of history!



BOTH

What could be better than a family extension?

A genetic duet,

A little two part invention



LIZZIE

I say: Consider what we'll have in hand when we get her



DANNY

Him!



LIZZIE

So?



DANNY

Yes!



LIZZIE

YES!!!



BOTH

We're going to have a baby!



LIZZIE

And not get married



DANNY

Now, hold on...



LIZZIE

Your sense of mission, my sense of duty

Your disposition my inner beauty



DANNY

Your intuition, my sense of timing



LIZZIE

Your composition, my crazy rhyming



BOTH

Matching of taste that's really uncanny



LIZZIE

My little waist



DANNY

My little fanny



BOTH

Lizzie and Danny, what could be better than that?
