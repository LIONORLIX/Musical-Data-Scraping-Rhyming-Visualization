Love Is Always Lovely in the End


Tottendale

Love make lovers worry

Love makes lovers fret

But here's a fact on which we can depend

Just like long ago when Romeo loved Juliet

Love is always lovely in the end



Underling (spoken)

Romeo and Juliet was a tragedy, Madam.



Tottendale

Oh, I never read reviews

(sung)

Love can start a quarrel

Love can cause a din

But love has always been a trusty friend

Twas a happy fate for Hank the Eight and Anne Boleyn

Love is always lovely in the end



Underling (spoken)

I must point out Madam, that Anne Boleyn lost her head



Tottendale

Yes. Because she was IN LOVE!

(sung)

Love was good to Eve and Adam



Underling (spoken)

Here we go again



Tottendale (sung)

And Sampson and Delilah too



Underling (spoken)

Good grief

(sung)

May I pose a question Madam?



Tottendale (spoken)

Why yes. Of course.



Underling (sung)

Why does nothing I sayto you ever get through?



Tottendale (spoken)

Don't mind if I do.



Underling and Tottendale (sung)

Love is always lovely in the end.



Tottendale

Love sneaks up behind you

Love drops from above

But love would never conciously offend

Love has certainly been kind to me and my true love

Love is alway lovely in the end



Underling

But your husband was a brute.



Tottendale

I don't mean HIM you silly coot



Underling (spoken)

Oh, Madam!



Tottendale (sung)

Love is always lovely



Underling

Lovely lovely lovely



Underling and Tottendale

Love is alway lovely in the end

Love is alway lovely in the end
