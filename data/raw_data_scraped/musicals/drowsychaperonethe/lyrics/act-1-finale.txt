Act 1 Finale


Janet (spoken)

Why are we dancing? Our dreams are in tatters.



Robert

Yes. Yes... But the tune is so infectious!



Janet

Oh Robert! This is the saddest day of my life!



All (sung)

Wedding bells won't ring

Wedding Bells won't chime

They will never celebrate their

Happy wedding time!
