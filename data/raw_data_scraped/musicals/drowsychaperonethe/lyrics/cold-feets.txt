Cold Feets


Robert

Hey there Mister Mirror Man

Shakin' and a quakin'

Tremblin' like 'dem

fraidy cats do

Somethin' big be botherin' you



Cold Feets

Cold Feets



Brother you got cold feets

You can make 'dem

cold feets hot

With little rhythm



Young Feets

Old Feets

Can be uncontrolled feets

Rhythm make 'dem

cold feets trot

Down the aisle



FRosty arches

They can learn to swing

Ivy toes can jive

Wedding marches

Played in ragtime swing

Make frigid soles come alive

And take that dive



Cold feets Shmold feets

Turn 'em into bold feets

Rhythm make them cold feets

Hot!



(spoken)

George

Say what are you up to?



Robert

I'm singing a song an old Negro taught me.

A Dixie remedy fro wedding day jitters.



George

You think you've got the jitters?

You've got the easy part! I have the weight of the wedding on my shoulders!



Robert

George, it sounds lke you'vee got cold feets.



(sung)

George

Robert

Cold feets



George

What do I want?



Robert

Bold feets



George

What do I do- scold feets?



Robert

Nooooo!

You make 'da cold feets hot



Both

5-6-7-8

Cold Feets cold feets

Thurn 'em into bold feets

Rhythm make 'dem

cold feets hot

You make da cold feets hot

You make da cold feets hot

You make da cold feets hot
