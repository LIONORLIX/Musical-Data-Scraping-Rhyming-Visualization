Show Off


JANET

I don't wanna show off no more.

I don't wanna sing tunes no more.

I don't wanna ride moons no more.

I don't wanna show off.



I don't wanna wear this no more.

Play the saucy swiss miss no more.

Blow my signature *kiss* no more.

I don't wanna show off.



Don't try to control me,

I've made up my mind.

And that's it. I quit.

I'm leaving it all behind.



I don't wanna be cute no more.

Make the gentleman hoot no more

I don't wanna wear fruit no more.

I don't wanna show off

Never see these again!



REPORTERS

[Spoken]

Farewell!

Been swell!



I don't wanna change key's no more!

I don't wanna strip tease no more!

I don't wanna say "Cheese" no more!

I don't care if you scoff



I don't wanna be cheered no more

praised no more

I don't wanna show off

GANGSTER #2

[Spoken]

Mr. Feldzieg, it is painfully obvious that Ms. Van De Graaff has no desire

to continue the life on the stage



FELDZIEG

Don't worry boys, this isn't over yet



KITTY

Yeah, I'm surprised she didn't do an Encore.



JANET

[Sung]

I don't want an Encore no more!

Keep em' shoutin' for more no more!

Dissappear through the floor no more!

I don't wanna show off.
