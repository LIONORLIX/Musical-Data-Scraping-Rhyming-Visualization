Message from a Nightingale


SONG SING



I bring a message from a nightingale



EMPEROR'S HENCHMEN



Nightingale, nightingale, nightingale song



SONG SING



I bring a message

From a nightingale



EMPEROR'S HENCHMEN



-Ong, -Ong, -Ong, -Ong

Nightingale ahhhh!



THE EMPEROR



You no bow?  Emperor and American rady no see eye to eye



AMERICAN LADY



But Emperor, sometimes a different outlook can

change your point of view.



THE EMPEROR



Whaaaa?



AMERICAN LADY

Precisely.

What is it about the Asians

That fascinates Caucasians

What is it about the Asians

That's so nice

Is it the won tons?  The egg rolls?  The rice?

Perhaps it's Buddha or Confucius and their

excellent advice



THE EMPEROR



What is it about Caucasians

That mystifies we Asians?

What is it about Caucasians that's so odd?

They call a pretty rady a broad

They have hair upon their chest

And they only have one god?

Impossible



THE EMPEROR & AMERICAN LADY



Whaaaaa......



AMERICAN LADY



Oh Emperor, you're so light on your feet

The people of the world are varied

But differences are in the plan



THE EMPEROR



The only difference I can see

That means anything to me

Is the one between a rady and a man



AMERICAN LADY



Don't you mean lady?



THE EMPEROR



Rady.



AMERICAN LADY



Precisely

What is it about the Asians



THE EMPEROR



What is it about Caucasians



AMERICAN LADY



What makes them so astounding



THE EMPEROR



What makes them so confusing



THE EMPEROR & AMERICAN LADY



It's you



ENSEMBLE
