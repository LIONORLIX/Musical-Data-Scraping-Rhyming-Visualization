Bride's Lament


JANET

I put a monkey on a pedestal

And tried to make that monkey stay

And he did for a time

But he needed to climb

And with other monkeys play

Far away



He left his jacket on that pedestal

Beside his tiny rusty cup

And I haven't got the strength to pick them up

Oh monkey, monkey, monkey

You broke my heart in two

But I'll always save that pedestal

For you



Come my little monkey

Come my little monkey, do



Oh monkey, monkey, monkey

You broke my heart in two

But I'll always save that pedestal

For you



Come my little monkey

Come my little monkey, do



(Spoken)

Wait!

I'm Janet Van De Graaff!

I don't need anyone!

What do I care about the love of one man when I am adored by millions!



(Sung)

Do I need to be so gloomy?

No, no, no

I could rule the world

If so I chose

Sigmund Freud sends flowers to me every show



Gertrude Stein she handed me a rose

I'm Janet, Janet Van De Graaff

Ain't no nail that I can't hammer

Why give up a life of glamour

Life of glamour

Life of glamour

Noooooooo!!



CHORUS

Monkey monkey

Monkey monkey

Monkey monkey monkey



JANET

I'm an accident waiting to happen



CHORUS

Monkey monkey monkey



JANET

I don't wanna show off now more



CHORUS

Monkey monkey



JANET

I don't wanna spread mirth no more



CHORUS

Monkey monkey



JANET

Be the greatest on Earth no more

I don't wanna

I wanna

I don't wanna

I wanna

I don't

I do

I don't

I do

I don't wanna show off



DROWSY, GEORGE, ALDOLPHO, KITTY, FELDZIEG,

GANGSTER 1, GANGSTER 2 & ENSEMBLE

Stay Janet stay Janet stay upon the stage Janet

Millions want to see you shine



JANET

And I think sure Janet sure Janet

Future is secure Janet

Millions will do just fine



But any future I could ever care to shape

Includes just one two timin' cad who drives me ape



CHORUS

She put a monkey on a pedestal

And tried to make that monkey stay

And he did for a time

But he needed to climb

And with other monkeys play



JANET (Spoken)

Oh Robert!  What a fool I've been!

A hapless fool!  I know now that I love you, but I've thrown it all away!

I love you monkey... but it love enough?  Is love ever enough?



CHORUS

That's the story of a monkey gone astray



JANET

I ask



CHORUS

Monkey monkey



JANET

The stars



CHORUS

Monkey monkey



JANET

Above

Is it the monkey or my pedestal

I love
