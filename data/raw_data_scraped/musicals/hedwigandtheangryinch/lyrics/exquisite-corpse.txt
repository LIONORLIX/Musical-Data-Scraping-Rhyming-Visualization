Exquisite Corpse


Oh God

I'm all sewn up

A hardened razor-cut

Scar map across my body

And you can trace the lines

Through Misery's design

That map across my body



A collage

All sewn up

A montage

All sewn up



A random pattern with a needle and thread

The overlapping way diseases are spread

Through a tornado body

With a hand grenade head

And the legs are two lovers entwined



Inside I'm hollowed out

Outside's a paper shroud

And all the rest's illusion

That there's a will and soul

That we can wrest control

From chaos and confusion



A collage

All sewn up

A montage

All sewn up



The automatist's undoing

The whole world starts unscrewing

As time collapses and space warps

You see decay and ruin

I tell you "No, no no no"

You make such an exquisite corpse"



I've got it all sewn up

A hardened razor-cut

Scar map across my body

And you can trace the lines

Through Misery's design

That map across my body



A collage

All sewn up

A montage

All sewn up
