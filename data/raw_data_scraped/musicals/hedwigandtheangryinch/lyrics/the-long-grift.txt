The Long Grift


Look what you've done,

you gigolo.

You know that I loved you, hon,

and I didn't want to know

that your cool,

seductive serenade

was a tool

of your trade,

you gigolo.



Of all the riches you've surveyed,

and all that you can lift,

I'm just another dollar that you made

in you long, long grift.



Look what you've done,

you gigolo.

Another hustle has been run,

and now you ought to know

that this fool

can no longer be swayed

by the tools

of your trade,

you gigolo.



I'm just another john you've gypped,

another sucker stiffed,

a walk on role in the script

to your long, long grift.

The love that had me in your grip

was just a long, long grift.
