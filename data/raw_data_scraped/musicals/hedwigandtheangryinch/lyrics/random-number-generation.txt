Random Number Generation


Random Number Generation

all our feelings and thoughts

expressed in ones and in oughts

in endless spiraling chains

you can't decode or explain

cause you are so analog

god dog I eye I god dog



we're the random number generation

we are random number generated

we are random numbers



in the regime of the solid state

wheels spin when you iterate

k is x squared minus one

but .54321

when x is taken times two

that's when we're coming for you



we're the random number generation

we are random number generated

we are random numbers



Mister Little started something huge

Iggy Pop Iggy Stooge

all the children shout out,

hey here we are



we're the random number generation

we are random number generated

we are random numbers
