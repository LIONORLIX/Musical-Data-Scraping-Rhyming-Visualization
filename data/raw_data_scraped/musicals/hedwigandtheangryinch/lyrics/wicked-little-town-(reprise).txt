Wicked Little Town (Reprise)


Forgive me,

For I did not know.

'Cause I was just a boy

And you were so much more



Than any god could ever plan,

More than a woman or a man.

And now I understand how much I took from you:

That, when everything starts breaking down,

You take the pieces off the ground

And show this wicked town

something beautiful and new.



You think that Luck

Has left you there.

But maybe there's nothing

up in the sky but air.



And there's no mystical design,

No cosmic lover preassigned.

There's nothing you can find

that can not be found.

'Cause with all the changes

you've been through

It seems the stranger's always you.

Alone again in some new

Wicked little town.



So when you've got no other choice

You know you can follow my voice

Through the dark turns and noise

Of this wicked little town.

Oh it's a wicked, little town.

Goodbye, wicked little town.
