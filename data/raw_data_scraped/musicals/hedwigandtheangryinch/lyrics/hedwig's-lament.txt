Hedwig's Lament


I was born on the other side

of a town ripped in two

And no matter how hard I've tried

I end up black and blue



I rose from off of the doctor's slab

I lost a piece of my heart

Now everyone gets to take a stab

They cut me up into parts



I gave a piece to my mother

I gave a piece to my man

I gave a piece to the rock star

He took the good stuff and ran
