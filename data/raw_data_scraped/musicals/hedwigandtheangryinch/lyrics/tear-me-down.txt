Tear Me Down


Ladies and gentlemen,

whether you like or not

HEDWIG!



I was born on the other side

of a town ripped in two

I made it over the great divide

now I'm coming for you



Enemies and adversaries

they try and tear me down

You want me, baby, I dare you

Try and tear me down



I rose from off of the doctor's slab

like Lazarus from the pit

Now everyone wants to take a stab

and decorate me

with blood graffiti and spit



Enemies and adversaries

they try and tear me down

You want me, baby, I dare you

Try and tear me down



On August 12, 1961,

a wall was erected

down the middle of the city of Berlin.

The world was divided by a cold war

and the Berlin Wall

was the most hated symbol of that divide

Reviled. Graffitied. Spit upon.

We thought the wall would stand forever,

and now that it's gone,

we don't know who we are anymore.

Ladies and Gentlemen,

Hedwig is like that wall,

standing before you in the divide

between East and West,

Slavery and Freedom,

Man and Woman,

Top and Bottom.

And you can try to tear her down,

but before you do,

remember one thing.



Listen

There ain't much of a difference

between a bridge and a wall

Without me right in the middle, babe

you would be nothing at all



Enemies and adversaries

they try and tear me down

You want me, baby, I dare you

try and tear me down.
