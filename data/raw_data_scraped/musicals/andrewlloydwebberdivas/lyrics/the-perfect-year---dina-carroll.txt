The Perfect Year - Dina Carroll


(From Sunset Boulevard)



Ring out the old

Ring in the new

A midnight wish

To share with you

Your lips are warm

My head is light

Were we alive

Before tonight



I dont need a crowded ball room

Everything I want is here

If you're with me

Next year will be...

The perfect year



Before we play

Some dangerous game

Before we fan

Some harmless flame

we have to ask

If this is wise

And if the game

Is worth the prize



With this wine and with the music

How can anything be clear

Let's just wait and see

It may just be

The Perfect Year



It's New Year's eve

And hopes are high

Dance one year in

Kiss one goodbye

Another chance

Another start

So many dreams

To tease the heart



We don't need a crowded ballroom

Everything we want is hear

And face to face

We will embrace

The perfect year



We don't need a crowded ballroom

Everthing we want is hear

and face to face

We will embrace

THE PERFECT YEAR!
