With One Look - Glenn Close


(From Sunset Boulevard)



With one look I can break your heart

With one look I play every part

I can make your sad heart sing

With one look you'll know all you need to know



With one smile I'm the girl next door

Or the love that you've hungered for

When I speak it's with my soul

I can play any role



No words can tell the stories my eyes tell

Watch me when I frown, you can't write that down

You know I'm right, it's there in black and white

When I look your way, you'll hear what I say



Yes, with one look I put words to shame

Just one look sets the screen aflame

Silent music starts to play

One tear in my eye makes the whole world cry



With one look they'll forgive the past

They'll rejoice I've returned at last

To my people in the dark

Still out there in the dark...



Silent music starts to play

With one look you'll know all you need to know



With one look I'll ignite a blaze

I'll return to my glory days

They'll say, "Norma's back at last!"



This time I am staying, I'm staying for good

I'll be back to where I was born to be

With one look I'll be me!
