Peter's Denial


MAID BY THE FIRE



I think I've seen you somewhere.

I remember.

You were with that man they took away.

I recognize your face.



PETER



You've got the wrong man lady.

I don't know him,

And I wasn't where he was tonight

Never near the place.



SOLDIER



That's strange, for I am sure I saw you with with him.

You were right by his side, and yet you denied.



PETER



I tell you I was never with him.



OLD MAN



But I saw you too.

He looked just like you.



PETER



I don't know him!



MARY MAGDALENE



Peter, don't you know what you have said.

You've gone and cut him dead.



PETER



I had to do it, don't you see?

Or else they'd go for me.



MARY MAGDALENE



It's what he told us you would do.

I wonder how he knew.
