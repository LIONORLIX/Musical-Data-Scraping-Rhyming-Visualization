This Jesus Must Die


PRIEST ONE



Good Caiaphas, the council waits for you.

The Pharisees and priests are here for you.



CAIAPHAS



Ah gentlemen, you know why we are here.

We've not much time, and quite a problem here



MOB (outside)



Hosanna! Superstar!

Hosanna! Superstar!

Hosanna! Superstar!

Hosanna! Superstar!



ANNAS



Listen to that howling mob of blockheads in the street!

A trick or two with lepers, and the whole town's on its feet.



ALL (inside)



He is dangerous!



MOB (outside)



Jesus Christ Superstar!



ALL (inside)



He is dangerous!



MOB (outside)



Tell us that you're who they say you are.



PRIEST TWO



The man is in town right now to whip up some support.



PRIEST THREE



A rabble rousing mission that I think we must abort.



ALL (inside)



He is dangerous!



MOB (outside)



Jesus Christ Superstar!



ALL (inside)



He is dangerous!



PRIEST TWO



Look Caiaphas, they're right outside our yard.



PRIEST THREE



Quick Caiaphas, go call the Roman guard.



CAIAPHAS



No, wait!

We need a more permanent solution to our problem.



ANNAS



What then to do about Jesus of Nazareth?

Miracle wonderman, hero of fools.



PRIEST THREE



No riots, no army, no fighting, no slogans.



CAIAPHAS



One thing I'll say for him -- Jesus is cool.



ANNAS



We dare not leave him to his own devices.

His half-witted fans will get out of control.



PRIESTS



But how can we stop him?

His glamour increases

By leaps every moment; he's top of the poll.



CAIAPHAS



I see bad things arising.

The crowd crown him king; which the Romans would ban.

I see blood and destruction,

Our elimination because of one man.

Blood and destruction because of one man.



ALL (inside)



Because, because, because of one man.



CAIAPHAS



Our elimination because of one man.



ALL (inside)



Because, because, because of one, 'cause of one, 'cause of one man.



PRIEST THREE



What then to do about this Jesus-mania?



ANNAS



Now how to we deal with a carpenter king?



PRIESTS



Where do we start with a man who is bigger

Than John was when John did his baptism thing?



CAIAPHAS



Fools, you have no perception!

The stake we are gambling are frighteningly high!

We must crush him completely,

So like John before him, this Jesus must die.

For the sake of the nation, this Jesus must die.



ALL (inside)



Must die, must die, this Jesus must die.



CAIAPHAS



So like John before him, this Jesus must die.



ALL (inside)



Must die, must die, this Jesus must, Jesus must, Jesus must die!
