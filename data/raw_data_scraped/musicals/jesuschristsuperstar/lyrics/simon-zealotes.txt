CROWD



Christ you know I love you.

Did you see I waved?

I believe in you and God

So tell me that I'm saved.

Christ you know I love you.

Did you see I waved?

I believe in you and God

So tell me that I'm saved.

Jesus I am with you.

Touch me, touch me, Jesus.

Jesus I am on your side.

Kiss me, kiss me, Jesus.



SIMON ZEALOTES



Christ, what more do you need to convince you

That you've made it, and you're easily as strong

As the filth from Rome who rape our country,

And who've terrorized our people for so long.



CROWD



Jesus I am with you.

Touch me, touch me, Jesus.

Jesus I am on your side.

Kiss me, kiss me, Jesus.



Christ you know I love you.

Did you see I waved?

I believe in you and God,

So tell me that I'm saved.



Christ you know I love you.

Did you see I waved?

I believe in you and God,

So tell me that I'm saved.



Christ you know I love you.

Did you see I waved?

I believe in you and God,

So tell me that I'm saved.



Christ you know I love you.

Did you see I waved?

I believe in you and God,

So tell me that I'm saved.



Jesus I am with you.

Touch me, touch me, Jesus.

Jesus I am on your side.

Kiss me, kiss me, Jesus.



SIMON ZEALOTES



There must be over fifty thousand

Screaming love and more for you.

And everyone of fifty thousand

Would do whatever you asked them to.

Keep them yelling their devotion,

But add a touch of hate at Rome.

You will rise to a greater power.

We will win ourselves a home.

You'll get the power and the glory

For ever and ever and ever

You'll get the power and the glory

For ever and ever and ever

You'll get the power and the glory

For ever and ever and ever

You'll get the power and the glory

For ever and ever and ever

Forever Amen! Amen! Amen!
