Pilate And Christ


PILATE



Who is this broken man, cluttering up my hallway?

Who is this unfortunate?



SOLDIER



Someone Christ,

King of the Jews.



PILATE



Oh, so this is Jesus Christ,

I am really quite surprised.

You look so small,

Not a king at all.

We all know that you are news,

But are you king?

King of the Jews?



JESUS



Your words, not mine.



PILATE



What do you mean by that?

That is not an answer.

You're deep in trouble friend,

Someone Christ,

King of the Jews.

How can someone in your state be so cool about his fate?

An amazing thing, this silent king.

Since you come from Galilee, then you need not come to me,

You're Herod's race!

You're Herod's case!



MOB



Hey Ho Sanna Hey Sanna Sanna Sanna Hosanna

Hey Sanna Ho and how

Hey J.C., J.C. please explain to me,

You had everything.

Where is it now?
