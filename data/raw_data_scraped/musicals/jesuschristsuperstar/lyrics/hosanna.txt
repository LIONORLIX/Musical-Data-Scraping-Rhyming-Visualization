CROWD

Hey Superstar



CAIAPHAS



Tell the rabble to be quiet, we anticipate a riot.

This common crowd, is much too loud.

Tell the mob who sing your song that they are fools and they are wrong.

They are a curse. They should disperse.



CROWD



Hosanna

Hey Sanna Sanna Sanna Hosanna

Hey Sanna Hosanna

Hey JC, JC you're alright by me

Sanna Hosanna

Hey Superstar



JESUS



Why waste your breath moaning at the crowd?

Nothing can be done to stop the shouting.

If every tongue were stilled

The noise would still continue.

The rocks and stone themselves would start to sing:



CROWD AND JESUS



Hosanna

Hey Sanna Sanna Sanna Hosanna

Hey Sanna Hosanna



CROWD (alone)



Hey JC, JC won't you fight for me?

Sanna Hosanna Hey Superstar



JESUS



Sing me your songs,

But not for me alone.

Sing out for yourselves,

For you are bless-ed.

There is not one of you

Who can not win the kingdom.

The slow, the suffering,

The quick, the dead.



CROWD and JESUS



Hosanna

Hey Sanna Sanna Sanna Hosanna

Hey Sanna Hosanna



CROWD (alone)



Hey JC, JC won't you die for me?

Sanna Hosanna Hey Superstar
