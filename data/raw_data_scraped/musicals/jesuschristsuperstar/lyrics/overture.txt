Overture


The Overture is heard over images of a troupe preparing their version of the Passion Play. They arrive out inm the Israeli desert in a bus with a cross attached to the roof along with many other props. As the performers unload off of the bus you get a feeling of celebration so often attributed to the late 60s, early 70s. They costume themselves. When the overture  exchos the '39 lashes', they remove the cross from the roof and when the overture breaks into a jubilant "Superstar", we are introduced to Jesus appearing from a pile of people... Could we start?
