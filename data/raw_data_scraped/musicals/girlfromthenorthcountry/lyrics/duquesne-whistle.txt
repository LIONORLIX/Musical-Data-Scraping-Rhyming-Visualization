Duquesne Whistle


Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowin’

Blowin’ like it’s gonna sweep my world away

I’m gonna stop in Carbondale and keep on going

That Duquesne train gonna ride me night and day



You say I’m a gambler, you say I’m a pimp

But I ain’t neither one



Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowin’

Sound like it’s on a final run



Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowin’

Blowin’ like she never blowed before

Blue light blinking, red light glowin’

Blowin’ like she’s at my chamber door



You smiling through the fence at me

Just like you always smiled before



Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowin’

Blowin’ like she ain’t gonna blow no more



Can’t you hear that Duquesne whistle blowin’

Blowin’ like the sky’s gonna blow apart

You’re the only thing alive that keeps me goin’

You’re like a time bomb in my heart



I can hear a sweet voice gently calling

Must be the Mother of our Lord



Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowin’

Blowin’ like my woman’s on board



Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowin’

Blowin’ like it’s gonna blow my blues away

You ole rascal, I know exactly where you’re goin’

I’ll lead you there myself at the break of day



I wake up every morning with that woman in my bed

Everybody telling me she’s gone to my head



Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowin’

Blowin’ like it’s gonna kill me dead



Can’t you hear that Duquesne whistle blowin’

Blowin’ through another no-good town

The lights of my native land are glowin’

I wonder if they’ll know me next time around



I wonder if that old oak tree’s still standing

That old oak tree, the one we used to climb



Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowin’

Blowin’ like she’s blowin’ right on time
