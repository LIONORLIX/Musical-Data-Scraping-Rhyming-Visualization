Tight Connection to My Heart (Has Anybody Seen My Love)


Well, I had to move fast

And I couldn't with you around my neck

You said you'd send for you and you did

What did you expect?

My hands are sweating

And we haven't even started yet

I'll go along with the charade

Until I can think my way out

I know it was all a big joke

Whatever it was all about

Someday maybe

I'll remember to forget.



I'm gonna get my coat

I feel the breath of a storm

There's something I've got to do tonight

You go inside and stay warm.



Has anybody seen my love

Has anybody seen my love

Has anybody seen my love

I don't know

Has anybody seen my love?



You want to talk to me

Go ahead and talk

Whatever you got to say to me

Won't come as any shock

I must be guilty of something

You just whisper it into my ear

Madame Butterfly

She lulled me to sleep

In a town without pity

Where the water runs deep

She said, "Be easy, baby

There aint nothing worth stealing in here".



You're the one I've been looking for

You're the one that's got the key

But I can't figure out whether I'm too good for you

Or, or you're too good for me. Has anybody seen my love

Has anybody seen my love

Has anybody seen my love

I don't know

Has anybody seen my love?
