Brother, Pt. 3


Michael:

I remember one October

She was raking leaves in the garden

Wearing your old ski team jacket, six sizes too big

I can see her smiling,

Fallen leaves in her hair, smelling the air



Jamie:

I remember driving home from college

She was baking bread in the kitchen

She was not too good in the kitchen

The bread got burned, but I ate two slices anyway

With butter and jam

Amanda left me

I just got fired

I miss Mom

Responsibilities to the living

I?d never realized before

Not till now, that is

This life, this love

We?re only human after all

Are you still holding my hand?

Promise you?ll never let go



Both:

Are you still holding my hand?

Promise you?ll never let go



Michael:

Brother, calling my brother



Jamie:

Hey, brother
