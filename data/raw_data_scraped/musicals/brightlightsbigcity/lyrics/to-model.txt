To Model


Amanda:

To model is to show the world

The power of a beautiful illusion

To model it to wallow in a blissful state

Of chaos and confusion

The catwalk, the bitch talk

The ulcers, the menopause at twenty-five

To model, to model is to fly

To model is to never have to go back to my Kansas City trailer

To model is to lose the fear I always used to feel

Of future failure

The flashbulbs, the camera wall

The media, the big cocaine in the upstairs lounge

To model, to model is to get me high

Didn?t I wanna be somebody?

Didn?t I wanna be someone?

Remember when I met you?

Me, the little flower girl from Kansas

All my glossy magazines and magic dreams

Of Studio 54, the Plaza Hotel

Mama said don?t marry you, he?ll run off like they always do

Like all her husbands did before

Mommy?s now on husband number four

Men always leave

But there you were, a boy with a book

Moving East, take me to

Bright lights, big city

Bright lights, big city, yeah



Jamie:

Remember when we took that horse and carriage

Through the park and walked to Tiffany?

Lunch at the Four Seasons

Talking marriage and the giving up of liberty

The wedding bells, the cocktail check

That funny little hat you wore when walking down the aisle

I miss your smile, I miss your smile



Amanda:

To model is to finally see another side of me

That was in hiding

To model is to shut my eyes and float upon this fantasy

I?m riding

I like it, I love it

The world outside my window every morning when I rise

I open up my eyes to see

To model is to release the me inside

You can see me Thursday

I?ll be modeling on MTV
