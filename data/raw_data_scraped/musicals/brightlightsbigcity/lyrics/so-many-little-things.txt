So Many Little Things


Jamie:

The rain on the porch of our house in Box County

The warmth of the folks by the fire inside

The hammock I swung on while figuring out

The world was too wide

That I never fit in, hidden from you

Mommy, always on the outside looking in

So many little things

So many little things

I misplaced my keys

The balance of my checkbook is never what it seems

So much tiny trivia

Like the color of my socks at school

Like those vicious little finger

Pointing out my otherness

So many little things

So many little things

Back at our apartment

The memories lurk like dust balls

In the corner of her closet I find bits of satin

Strewn around Manhattan

So many little tings

Records on the stereo

Elvis Costello



Jamie and Ensemble:

I know the world is killing you



Jamie:

So many little things

So many little things

At least the big things declare open combat on you

No sniping from the trees

Or days like these

So many little things

I misplaced my keys

I don?t wanna go home

Who needs the memories?

I listen for the echo

Of a melancholy silence

The presence of her absence

Shrieks and moans

And says

So many little things

So many little things

Tonight I should stay home with some comfort food and some Family Feud

?So Jamie, for $10,000 what could you have said to your mother

Before she died??

So many little things
