Perfect Feeling


Jamie:

Kindness? Heavy

I don?t meet that many benevolent people



Vicky:

I?m not that surprised

Manhattan



Jamie:

I?m Vicky



Vicky:

No, you?re Jamie



Jamie:

Right, you?re Vicky



Vicky:

And you?re Jamie



Jamie:

Look at those freckles

I didn?t know the made them anymore

Vicky, Vicky

One in a million



Vicky:

The philosophy of love

Think about what Plato said,

?You love therefore you are?



Jamie:

You send me reeling



Both:

What a perfect feeling

What a perfect feeling



Vicky:

Amanda?



Jamie:

Heavy



Vicky:

Do you still love her?

Here?s my number



Jamie:

I?ll call you



Vicky:

You better

You?re a writer, write me a letter



Jamie:

>From out of the blue, it?s green for go

I?m in the pink

Kissing a philosopher really colors the way you think



Both:

What a perfect feeling

What a perfect feeling



Jamie:

What a perfect feeling
