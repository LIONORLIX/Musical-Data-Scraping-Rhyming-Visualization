I Hate the French


Jamie:

Depardieu?s a restaurant critic

He hasn?t left Paris in years

He spends his days in cafes and cabarets

Driving me to tears

His spelling?s completely atrocious

His turn of phrase absurd

He thinks he?s pretty precocious

But his shit is full of merde

I hate the French

I hate them all

From Toulouse Le Fucking Trek

To Charles de Gaulle

I can?t stand the way they put that little thing above the ?e?

I hate the French

I hate the French

I hate the French

I hate the French

I hate the French

I hate the French

I hate the French

Bonjour, Monsieur Depardieu

Vous too, Monsieur Depardieu

You?re making my life a misery too

So may I say something entre new?

Go to hell Jacques Brell, the Eiffel Tower too



Secretary:

Jamie, Jacques Brell is Belgian



Jamie:

I hate the French



Secretary:

He hates the French

Jamie:

They?re beau gele

Their cheese, their Paris breeze



Secretary:

Their gay parades



Jamie:

Pierre Cardin, your concaven

Has got a lousy stench

I hate the French



Secretary:

He hates the French



Jamie:

I hate the French



Secretary:

He hates the French



Jamie:

I hate the French



Secretary:

I hate the French



Both:

We hate the French



Jamie:

They say that they have savoir faire

But I can?t see it anywhere

The world thinks jejune petit

Moi aussi

I hate the French

That?s the deal



Secretary:

Though I do agree with wine at every meal



Jamie:

But apart from that, I have to say

I?ve never met a French, mench

I rest my case

I take the bench

I hate the French



Secretary:

Jamie, it?s your brother calling again
