Coma Baby


Ensemble:

Fucking train, fucking rain

Fucking pain in my brain

Monday morning

Woke up grumpy, feeling frumpy

Feeling lumpy, cup of coffee

Read the paper

What?s the headline?



Coma Baby:

Coma baby, coma baby

Monday morning, coma baby

Will I ever see the light of day?

Stuck in here in mommy?s tummy

Warm in here, I want to stay

And chase the Monday morning blues away



Ensemble:

Save us from the teenage terrorists,

Lottery winners, sicko creeps,

Elizabeth Taylors, living nightmares,

Life on other planets, Janet

Spontaneous human combustion, dammit



Coma Baby:

Coma baby, coma baby,

Look at Jamie, slept through Sunday

Late for work again

But not too bad

Well, he never fit in really

Father always on the move

New school every year

We all got our problems, baby



Coma Baby and Ensemble:

You?ve got to rise above it

Move on up

Shimmy, shimmy, gimme

Gimme, feel me fatal

Fire and metal, rocks and steel

Rim shaw, ricashay, do anything you feel

Yeah, yeah, yeah

Whoa, whoa, whoa



Chuck Bean:

This is Chuck Bean on the scene

Of yet another murder

Where the blame is down to crack,

The new smack

The Mayor vows to attack crack

I?ll be back

This is Chuck Bean on the scene

Live from New York City

And remember, people,

Survive, stay alive



Coma Baby and Ensemble:

Coma baby, coma baby,

Coma baby, coma



Mary O?Brien McCann:

Please, could you find me?

Please don?t go
