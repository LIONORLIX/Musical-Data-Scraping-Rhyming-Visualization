Monstrous Events


Tad:

Monstrous events are scheduled

Monstrous events are scheduled

Monstrous events are scheduled

For tonight

It?s Saturday, the city is alive with expectations

My breath is baited

I?m wet with anticipation

Please excuse the vernacular

But tonight will be spectacular

A mega party at a downtown loft

Your old treasure nice and soft

Come if you dare

And Amanda will be there
