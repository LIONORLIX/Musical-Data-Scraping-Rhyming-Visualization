Back in the City


Tad:

Jamie!



Jamie:

Tad!



Tad:

Monstrous events are scheduled for tonight

I went away, just for the day

To see my family

What a bore

Too many cocktails on the lawn

Discussing sodomy and nuclear war

Another yuppie puppy party

In Connecticut suburbia

The global meltdown has begun

And it?s beginning in suburbia

I lit across the bridge, I flew into a cab

I caught the first train back



Tad and Girl:

Grand Central Station here I come

I need the middle of your

Fastest, fastest track



Tad:

And then I get there and walk east on 42nd

To the place where the light hits the sky

That?s right, yeah

And I stand on my tiptoes and scream at the rooftops,

?Hey, did you miss me?

Come over and kiss me!?

It?s great to be back in the city



Chorus:

Great back in the the city



Tad:

It?s great to be back in my town



Chorus:

Great back in my town



Tad and Chorus:

Great to be back where such plenty goes down

I got plenty to go around



Tad:

Look at the people

Swarming around like flies

They don?t know me



Tad and Chorus:

I?m a hundred stories high



Tad:

I?m lookin? out my penthouse window

At the New York City skyline, I say,

?Honey baby, you?re all mine.?

Yeah

It?s great to be back in the city



Chorus:

Great back in the the city



Tad:

It?s great to be back in my town



Chorus:

Great back in my town



Tad:

Back in the town where such



Tad and Chorus:

Plenty goes down

And there?s plenty to go around



Chorus (repeated):

1984



Tad:

There?s money falling from the sky

Grab some, have some



Tad and Chorus:

Falling too fast

(Falling to fast)

Running too free

(Running too free)

Happy just to be in heartbreak

Jumping too far

(Jumping too far)

Crashing the ledge

(Crashing the ledge)

Dancing on the edge of heartbreak

Put all the hookers around the door

Turn down the tricks at the bar

Never the less, here we are

The more impossible it is to get in,

The more we want to explore



Chorus (repeated):

1984



Coke Girl:

The drugs make you feel the music

And the music makes you want more drugs



Chorus:

Heartbreak



Jamie:

And all you need is one more popper

One more vodka

One more topsy-turvy, hunky-dory

Manic, manic, magic high



Jamie and Chorus:

Listen to the voices

Raging round inside your head again

Like a message from the Vatican

They?re watching as you?re slipping,

As you?re ripping into tripping

Are you willing to be killing

All the dreams that you are having?

Skipping, dripping, slipping, sliding

When you really should be flying from heartbreak

Welcome to the party baby, come on in

Bright lights, big city



Jamie:

We?ll get you in the middle of the universe



Jamie and Chorus:

Bright lights, big city

Look at the lights

We?ll get you in the middle of the universe in 1984

Bright lights, big city
