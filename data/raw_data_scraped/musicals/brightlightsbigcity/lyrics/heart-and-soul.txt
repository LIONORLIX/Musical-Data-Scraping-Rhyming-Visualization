Heart and Soul


Michael:

Christmas morning, cold and frosty

Huddling underneath the tree

I can see us now, cuddling Mommy

Mommy always loved you more than me

Psychologically speaking,

That was way beyond control

Till I let things settle in my heart,

Heart and soul

Christmas morning, decade later

I am waiting by the phone

I can see me now; you said you?d call me

Three hours later I forgive you once again

Theoretically speaking,

I?m still waiting for that call

Wondering what to do

Cause brother, when it comes to you

The heart tends toward mercy

And the soul leans toward love

And my heart and soul in my dream of life loves you

Heart and soul



Vicky:

I?ve been dreaming, little children

Making messes on their Dungarees and dresses

Riding painted ponies through holes in the sky

Philosophically speaking,

If I share my dreams with you

We could find a place somewhere in time



Both:

Where the heart tends toward mercy

And the soul leans toward love

And my heart and soul in my dream of life loves you

Heart and soul

Where the heart tends toward mercy

And the soul leans toward love

And my heart and soul in my dream of life



Michael, Vicky, and Mom:

Loves you



Michael and Vicky:

Heart and soul



Mom:

Loves you



Michael and Vicky:

Heart and soul

Heart and soul
