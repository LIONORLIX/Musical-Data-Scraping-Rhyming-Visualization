You Couldn't Handle It Jamie


Clara:

You couldn?t handle it, Jamie

You couldn?t handle it, Jamie

These proofs are a mess, two accents reversed

An electoral district in France incorrectly identified

Inexcusable, Jamie

In fifty years of publication

We?ve only issued one retraction

What about our reputation?

Do you know how serious this is, Jamie?

You couldn?t handle it, Jamie

You couldn?t handle it, Jamie

I?ve given you the benefit of the doubt before

But not today

I would like to know what you have to say



Jamie:

Come on, come on

I know what it?s like

I?ve seen you before

Weeknights on Columbus Avenue

Clutching your drink

Piano Bar Blue

Waiting for someone, anyone at all

To say hello

How did it all start coming undone?
