Missing


Coma Baby:

Coma baby, coma baby

Still I lie in mommy?s tummy

Warm in here, I think I want to stay

Mommy?s crying, mommy?s dying

Mommy might not even last the day



Mary O?Brien McCann:

I am Mary O?Brien McCann

I was last seen in Washington Square

Now I?m missing

I met a man with a plan

He took my shivering hand

Now I?m gone

Please, could you find me?

Please don?t go

Please, could you find me?

Please don?t go



Jamie:

Don?t go Amanda

Amanda, I see your face everywhere

I sense your skin, smell your hair

There?s no escaping after all

There?s your poster on that wall

On that wall, on that wall
