Are You Still Holding My Hand?


Mom:

It?s embarrassing,

This pain I feel

It doesn?t matter anymore

People waste their time being embarrassed

We?re only human after all

Are you still holding my hand?

Promise you?ll never let go

This pain I?m felling is like when you were born

I?d never felt such pain before

Not till now, that is

This pain

We?re only human after all

Are you still holding my hand?

Promise, you?ll never let go

Have you had many lovers?

I?ve never heard their names

There?s still so much to know

Responsibilities to the living

I?d never realized before

Not till now, that is

This life, this love

We?re only human after all

Are you still holding my hand?

Promise you?ll never let go
