Back in the City, Pt. 2


Tad:

Monstrous events are scheduled

Monstrous event are scheduled for tonight

I gotta date a half past eight with Natalie and Slinky Inga

Before it?s late I wanna have the wrapped around my pinky finger

I need a favor, Jamie

My cousin Vicky, she?s in town tonight

I think you?ll like her flavor

So could you entertain her?

Meet her at nine for a cocktail or three

Could you do that for me, Jamie?

There?s a gram in it man

And she?s quite whoopdedoo

A philosophy major at Princeton U

Get up and get back in the city

Time to get back on the town

Back in the town here such plenty goes down

And we?ve got plenty to go around
