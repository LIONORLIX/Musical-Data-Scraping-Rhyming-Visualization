Kindness


Vicky:

Well, it was my father really

Indirectly speaking, Daddy never read philosophy

But he lived by a strict philosophical code

Dad was in investment banking

Very proper, always thanking people

He was kind to me; I?d sit on his knee when he?d get home

He would say to me,

?Think of what the world could be if we could just be

Kind to each other.?

I thought about what Daddy said

I thought about the thoughts in my head

At 12 I found this book by Young

?Considering Thoughts of Modern Men?

That was when I found I like

To delve into the human psych

And when my musings got confusing

Daddy said, ?Just do what you can

And think of what the world could be

If we could just be kind to each other.?

And Daddy found another woman

Daddy found much younger woman

I came home to find Mommy flailing,

Wailing at the wall

Kindness, there?s not enough kindness in the world

Daddy?s lying on a beach now

With Gloria the stewardess

His contradictions spilling out

Of his new tight blue jeans

So much for his riff on kindness

I mark it down to human blindness

But I don?t mind too much, cause I love him

I say, ?Nice jeans Dad.?

Just to be kind

Think of what the world could be

If we could just be kind to each other

Kindness, there?s not enough kindness in the world

Kindness
