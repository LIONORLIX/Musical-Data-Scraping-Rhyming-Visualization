There's A Shout


There's a shout in the camp, for the Lord is here,

Hallelujah! Praise His name;

To the feast of His love we again draw near,

Praise, oh, praise His name.



There's a shout in the land like the shout of old,

Hallelujah! Praise his name;

For the cloud of His glory we now behold,

Praise, oh, praise His name.



Room for the millions! There's room for all!

Hallelujah! Praise His name;

Come to the banquet, great and small,

Oh, praise, yes, praise His name.



There's a shout in the camp for the King of kings

Hallelujah! Praise His name;

While we drink from the rock of the living springs,

Praise, oh, praise His name.



There's a shout in the camp while our souls repeat,

Hallelujah! Praise His name;

There is room for the world at the Savior's feet,

Praise, praise, praise, praise Him!
