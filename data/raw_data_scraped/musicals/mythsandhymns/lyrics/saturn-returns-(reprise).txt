Saturn Returns (Reprise)


Long ago, I tasted something sweet.

It's an echo, it's a memory in retreat.

Like a feeling of fullness,

Like the knowing of quiet fortitude, of ancient heroes.

It was something I trusted somehow.

And now:

And now I am I am I am I am

I am the rise of Icarus.

I am the fall from Pegasus.

I am the lost Leander in the tide.

I am cold, alone, and set apart.

And I am warm as Hero's heart.

I am a circle

I am Saturn purified!

Once around the sun and now at last I see it!

This is what I am.



Long ago I left myself and now I try to return

As a stranger to a strange land and to the burn.

But the hollow inside me might be there to guide

Me home again,

Back to something sweet,

An opening, a passage way to guide me home.
