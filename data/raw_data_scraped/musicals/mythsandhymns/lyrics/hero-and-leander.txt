Hero And Leander


Could I be Leander?

On a wave am I borne?

Borne to a new home across this lonely sea?



Could you be my Hero, heart afire?

My lighthouse on the shoreline-

Could you be that to me?



Oh, I need you-

I need the rise and fall of your voice.

Oh, I love you,

And now I have a love to rejoice.



Hero and Leander, how your passion is brave.

Even if I drown here inside this wave,

My lighthouse on the shoreline,

My passion on this lonely sea,

My loving you was meant to be.
