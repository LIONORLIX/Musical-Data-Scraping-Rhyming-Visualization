Children Of The Heavenly King


Children of the Heavenly King,

As we journey let us sing;

Sing our Savior's worthy praise,

Glorious in his works,

In all his works and ways.



We are traveling home to God,

In the way our fathers trod;

They are happy now and we

Soon their happiness,

We soon their happiness shall see.
