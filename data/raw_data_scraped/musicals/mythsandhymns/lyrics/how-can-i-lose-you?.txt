How Can I Lose You?


How can I lose you?

You're all that I know.

What will I do now?

Where will I go?

We were together,

Now we are through.

Why am I losing you?

How can you leave me,

Leave me this way,

Leave me to miss you,

Day after day?

I look around now,

You're what I see.

Pictures of you leaving me.



No one should always lose.

Can't I find some kind of peace?

Nobody owns the blues,

But I have a long term lease.



I never know why,

I never know when.

I'm going along,

It happens again.

I have a blind spot forty miles wide.

I have a terrible weakness inside!

That's how I lose you.

That's how I lose you.



I was another girl:

Joyous and happy and free.

She was a perfect pearl.

When did she turn into me?



How can I lose you?

You're all that I had.

What did I say, now?

How was I bad?

Who can I turn to?

Where will I go?

How can I live now,

Missing you so?

How can you leave me?

You're all that I know! Oh!

That;s how I lost you!

That's how I always lost you.

That's how I'll always lose you:

Oh.
