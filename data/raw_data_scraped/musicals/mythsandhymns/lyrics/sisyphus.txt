Sisyphus: Chorus:

Roll

Stupid

This

Stupid

Rock

Stupid

Up

Stupid

There's a pint

Yes the point will unfold

I'll

Drop it

Not

Drop it

Stop

Stop it

No

Skip it

Not when there's a rock to be rolled

My

Goodness

Rock

Gracious

My

Goodness

Rock

Gracious

Nearly up to the top of the peak



My

What a

Rock

Rotten shame,

And it's always the same:

Rock rolls back

And it'll flatten him flat.

Few little bugs to work-

God, I have had it with that!

Hell is not what he imagines it is,

It is watching while he's going through his.

Race you up the rock pile!

Giddy up! Tally ho! Forward!

Do we have to?

Can't we go?

Not allowed!

You know what Zeus said:

Zeus again?

Zeus again!

"I want Sisyphus to draw a nice crowd!"-



Race ya to the rock pile!

Giddy up!

Tally ho!

Forward!

There's a pint here.

There's a point to be found.

I picked a different

Stupid.

Shape

Stupid.

Size

Stupid.

Rock.

Rock rolls back

Oops!

And it'll flatten him flat.

Oops,

Few little bugs to work-

Don't you even begin to say that!

Transfer please to anywhere else in

This joint!

But I need you guys beside me

To advise me and to guide me

While I miss the whole point.
