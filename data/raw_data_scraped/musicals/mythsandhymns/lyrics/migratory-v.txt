Migratory V


We sail above the weather

We search the ocean floor.

We rival our creation,

Still yearning for more.

But can we fly together-

A migratory V?

How wonderful if that's what God could see.



A single voice in whispered prayer

Can only pray to travel there.

But all as one,

We sound the everlasting sound

And sing our salvation.



Aloft and in formation,

A migratory V.

How wonderful if that's what God could see.
