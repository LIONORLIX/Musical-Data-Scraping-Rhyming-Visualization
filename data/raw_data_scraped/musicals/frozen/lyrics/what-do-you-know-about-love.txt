What Do You Know About Love


[Anna]

Hans is not a stranger



[Kristoff]

Okay. So what’s his last name?



[Anna]

Of the Southern Isles



[Kristoff]

That’s not a last name



[Anna]

You have opinions on my life and my relations

But let me tell you what



[Kristoff]

Okay enlighten me



[Anna]

Love is the one that has zero complications

And I can trust my gut



[Kristoff]

Okay you frighten me



[Anna]

Some people know their hearts

The minute true love starts



[Kristoff]

Some people read a lot of books



[Anna]

I like books



Some people simply know,

When true love says hello



[Kristoff]

Some folks are taken in by curly locks and princely looks



[Anna]

He does have princely looks

We agree on that one



[Kristoff]

Right! Ah by the way

What color eyes does he have?



[Anna]

Dreamy



[Kristoff]

All I’m sayin’ is when your go to climb a mountain

You don’t just jump to the top



[Anna]

If it’s true love you can



[Kristoff]

There’s scalin’ and scramblin’ and too many steps for countin’

And the work doesn’t stop



[Anna]

Maybe for you



[Kristoff]

Love’s not an easy climb

You have to take your time



[Anna]

We get a whole life

That’s the plan



[Kristoff]

That’s not a plan

Love’s not a thing you get

It’s work and tears and sweat



[Anna]

So says a sweaty smelly mountain man



[Anna & Kristoff]

Oh, what do you know about love?

What do you know about love?



What do you know about love?

What do you know about love?



[Anna]

Have you even kissed a girl?

I mean a human girl



[Kristoff]

Oh



[Anna & Kristoff]

What do you know about

anything

anything



[Kristoff]

Anyone with half a brain

would have worn some winter gear



[Anna]

Anyone with half a life

would have one friend who’s not a deer



[Kristoff]

I do!



Any fool who jumps headlong is gonna bang their head



[Anna]

Any fool who doesn’t jump right

Is gonna probably end up dead



[Kristoff]

Whoa



[Anna]

Like I said

Are you okay there?



[Kristoff]

I’ve been better



[Anna]

Don’t worry, I’ve got you



You should have listened to me

I know danger when I see it

Just like I know love when I see it—Whoa!



[Kristoff]

Whoa whoa whoa

Thank you



[Anna]

Ah. That’s not quite how I though we’d end up



[Kristoff]

You’ve got to think things through in life

And in love



[Anna]

Touché



[Kristoff]

Here

Grab on and brace yourself

Ready?

Here we go.



[Anna]

Whoa...whoa...whoa



I’d like to point out

That we’ve come a good long way here

And that you’re...wow...realy strong



[Kristoff]

I lift a lot of ice



You saved my life just now

I guess I gotta say here

My first impression was wrong



[Anna]

And see?

You’re nice!



[Kristoff]

That jump was really brave



[Anna]

Your catch was quite a save



[Kristoff]

You’ve got some guts



[Anna]

You’ve got some—brains



[Kristoff]

Thanks



[Anna & Kristoff]

With miles and miles to go

I guess it’s nice to know

That I can trust you

Though the question still remains

What do you know about love?



[Kristoff]

Just—be careful



[Anna & Kristoff]

What do you know about love?



[Anna]

Have a little faith



[Anna & Kristoff]

At least we know one thing

This trip should be interesting



What do you know about love?

What do you know about love?
