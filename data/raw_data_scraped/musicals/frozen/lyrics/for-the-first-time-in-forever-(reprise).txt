For the First Time in Forever (reprise)


ANNA:

You don't have to protect me! I'm not afraid!

Please don't shut me out again!

Please don't slam the door.

You don't have to keep your distance anymore.

'Cause for the first time in forever, I finally understand

For the first time in forever, we can fix this hand in hand.

We can head down this mountain together!

You don't have to live in fear!

'Cause for the first time in forever, I will be right here.



ELSA:

Anna, please go back home.

Your life awaits.

Go enjoy the sun and open up the gates.



ANNA: Yeah, but.



ELSA:

I know you mean well

But leave me be.

Yes, I'm alone, but I'm alone and free!

Just stay away and you'll be safe from me!



ANNA: Actually we're not.

ELSA: What do you mean you're not?

ANNA: I get the feeling you don't know.

ELSA: What do I not know?

ANNA: Arendalle's in deep deep deep deep snow.

ELSA: What?

ANNA: You kinda set off an eternal winter everywhere.

ELSA: Everywhere?

ANNA: It's okay! You can just unfreeze it!

ELSA: No I can't! I don't know how!



ANNA:

Sure you can! I know you can!

'Cause for the first time in forever (Oh I'm such a fool!)

(I can't be free!) You don't have to be afraid!

(No escape from the storm inside of me!)

We can work this out together. (Can't control the curse!)

We'll reverse the storm you've made.

(Oh please, you'll only make it worse!)

Don't panic. (There's so much fear!)

You'll make the the sun shine bright. (You're not safe here!)

We can face this thing together.

We can change this thing together.

Then we can be free.



ELSA: I can't!
