YOUNG ANNA:

Do you want to build a snowman?

C'mon let's go and play



YOUNG ELSA:

I can cover this whole place in snow

I'm not supposed to though



YOUNG ANNA:

Yeah, just do it anyway

Do it for your sister!

Elsa please, oh please

I can't do the things you do

That's what I'm talking about!!



YOUNG ELSA & YOUNG ANNA:

You really want to build that snowman?

You know I do

We'll stay up late and build that snowman!

Yes

Me and you



ENSEMBLE:

Nah nah yanana

Nah nah yanana



Once there was a family beloved by all

A king, a queen, two princesses

And the story starts when they were small



Ladies what have you been up to?



Elsa was a special child

From her first frozen tear

Her magic filled her parents' hearts

With so much love and fear



QUEEN IDUNA: (spoken)

Elsa no! What do we say?



YOUNG ELSA: (spoken)

Magic must stay a secret



QUEEN IDUNA: (spoken)

And there's just some things we can't do in public



YOUNG ANNA:

Like run naked in the breeze



YOUNG ELSA and QUEEN IDUNA:

ANNA!



YOUNG ANNA:

Let the sun shine on

Let our hearts be wild

Like this perfect, happy, shiny, summer day



KING and QUEEN:

Let the sun shine on



YOUNG ANNA:

'Cause it's alright



KING and QUEEN:

Together we can keep the storm at bay



YOUNG ANNA & YOUNG ELSA:

1 2 3 together, clap together

Snap together, you and me together

Knees together, freeze together

Up or down together, princess run together

Always be together

You and me



ENSEMBLE:

Once there was a family

With secrets to keep

As rulers in the land

Where respect for the crown runs deep



YOUNG ANNA: (spoken)

Freeze my butt



ENSEMBLE:

And so the royal family is ever on display

And people loved the princesses

And watch them as their pray

Let the sun shine on

Let our lives be free

Let the promises of our land be sure and strong

Let our hearts be blown by this melody

All of winter love



Na na na heyana

Naha heyana

Na na na heyana

Naha heyana



Let the sun shine on

On Arendelle

Let the crown be strong

And let your love be true

Let's our daughters spend what we lost

When we'll look to you
