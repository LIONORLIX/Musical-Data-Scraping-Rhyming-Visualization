Reindeer(s) Are Better Than People


KRISTOFF:

Reindeers are better than people

Sven, don't you think that's true?



KRISTOFF (As SVEN):

Yeah, people will beat you

And curse you and cheat you

Every one of them's bad except you



KRISTOFF:

Oh, thanks buddy

But people smell better

Than reindeers Sven, don't

you think that I'm right?



KRISTOFF (As SVEN):

That's once again true,

for all except you



KRISTOFF:

You got me, let's call it a night



KRISTOFF (As SVEN):

Good night



KRISTOFF:

Don't let the frostbite bite
