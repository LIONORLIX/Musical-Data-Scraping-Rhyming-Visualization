True Love


Anna:

I've sat alone in this room before

Hours and hours on end

I know this delusional 'Wish the door

Will open to reveal a friend'



I know this solitude

I know this kind of cold

But I had faith in what the stories told

Of true love

How I'd find true love



And here I am in this room again

Just as lost and small

That lonely girl with a desperate heart

Is who I am, after all



There's no escaping her

But now the dream is gone

Because I spend a lifetime counting on

True love

True love



I was looking for a fairy tale

And dove headfirst into his

Turns out, you cant find love

If you don't know what it is



And now it's clear I'll never leave this room

It ends as it began

With no one but myself to blame

I played my part

In the plan



Dreaming got me here

And yet the dream won't die

I can't wish it away

No matter how I try



True love

True love

True love
