A Little Bit of Yo


ELSA: (spoken)

You know, there’s a recipe to making a proper snowman



ANNA: (spoken)

Really?



ELSA: (spoken)

Uh-huh!



ELSA:

A little bit of you, a little bit of me

A part that loves to dream



ANNA:

A part that swings from a tree

A little like me, a little like you



ELSA:

A part that’s nice



ANNA:

A part that’s naughty too



BOTH:

A loyal friend who is there no matter what



ELSA:

A big round belly



ANNA:

And a big bouncy butt!



BOTH:

He’ll love warm hugs and the bright sunlight



ANNA:

And he’ll really love the summer



ELSA:

But he’ll melt!



ANNA:

Yeah, You’re right

Oh! So we’ll build him back together



ELSA:

Yes, together, that’s the key



BOTH:

‘Cause he’s a little bit of you and me



ELSA: (spoken)

Okay, time for bed!



ANNA: (spoken)

What? No! Time for more magic, please and thank you!



ELSA: (spoken)

Anna, you know I’m not supposed to even be doing this!



ANNA: (spoken)

But your magic is the most beautiful, wonderful, perfectful thing in the whole wide world!



ELSA: (spoken)

Do you really think so?



ANNA: (spoken)

Yes! So do it, please, before I burst from inside to outside!



ELSA: (spoken)

Okay, okay, don’t burst!



ANNA: (spoken)

Whoa!



ELSA:

A little bit of you, a little bit of me



ANNA:

You do the magic and I get to see



ELSA:

A little bit of fun



ANNA:

A little bit of fun in the middle of the night



ELSA:

A little bit of magic and it all takes flight



ELSA:

La la la lala lalala la la



ANNA:

This is so amazing! More more more!



ELSA:

A little bit of you!



ANNA:

Magic! Magic! Do it, Elsa, do it more!



ELSA:

A little bit of me



ANNA:

Me me me me me me me

Little bit of you, little bit of me!

Look at me!



ELSA: (screams)

Anna!
