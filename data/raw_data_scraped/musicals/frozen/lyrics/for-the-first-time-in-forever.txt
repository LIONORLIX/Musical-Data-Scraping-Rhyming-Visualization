For the First Time in Forever


ANNA:

The window is open, so's that door

I didn't know they did that anymore

And there's two nice ladies helping me get dressed

For years I've roamed these empty halls

Why have a ballroom with no balls?

Coronation day is just the best!



There'll be actual real live people

It'll be totally strange

But wow, am I so ready for this change



'Cause for the first time in forever

There'll be music, there'll be light

For the first time in forever

I'll be dancing through the night



Don't know if I'm elated or gassy

But I'm somewhere in that zone

'Cause for the first time in forever

I won't be alone



Spoken:

Oh I can't wait to meet everyone! (gasp)

What if I meet... the one?



Sung:

Tonight imagine me gown and all

Fetchingly draped against the wall

The picture of sophisticated grace

Ooh! I suddenly see him standing there

A beautiful stranger, tall and fair

I wanna stuff some chocolate in my face



But then we laugh and talk all evening,

Which is totally bizarre

Nothing like the life I've lead so far



For the first time in forever

There'll be magic, there'll be fun

For the first time in forever

I could be noticed by someone



And I know it is totally crazy

To dream I'd find romance

But for the first time in forever

At least I've got a chance



ELSA:

Don't let them in, don't let them see

Be the good girl you always have to be

Conceal, don't feel, put on a show

Make one wrong move and everyone will know



ELSA: But it's only for today

ANNA: It's only for today



ELSA: It's agony to wait

ANNA: It's agony to wait



ELSA: Tell the guards to open up the gate

ANNA: The gate



ANNA: For the first time in forever



ELSA: Don't let them in, don't let them see



ANNA: I'm getting what I'm dreaming of

ELSA: Be the good girl you always have to be



ANNA: A chance to leave my lonely world

ELSA: Conceal



ANNA: A chance to find true love

ELSA: Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know



ENSEMBLE:

For the first time in forever

We are all the song outside

For the first time in forever

The gates are open wide



ANNA:

I know it all ends tomorrow,

So it has to be today

'Cause for the first time in forever

For the first time in forever

Nothing's in my way!



ENSEMBLE: Today!
