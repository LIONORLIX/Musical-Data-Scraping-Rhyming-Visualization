Hans of the Southern Isles


HANS: (spoken)

Wait, don't go

You don't have to be embarassed princess "Oh-I'm-just-me"

(sung)

I'm someone even more embarassing to be

I'm only the thirteenth son of a king

Of a very small kingdom

Of very small islands to the South

And nobody sings about this humble face

Or my lack of grace

Or quotes what comes out of my mouth

Thank goodness

I've journeyed a long way to see your sister crowned

To honor and to back you

Yet here I go to smack you to the ground

Please accept the humblest of the apologies

From a clumsy prince who's only come to serve and please

With a line of mean, big brothers

That goes on for miles

A man you won't see on a statue of bronze

Just Hans of the Southern Isles



ANNA: (spoken)

Hi, Hans of the Southern Isles



HANS: (spoken)

Hi, Anna of Arendelle
