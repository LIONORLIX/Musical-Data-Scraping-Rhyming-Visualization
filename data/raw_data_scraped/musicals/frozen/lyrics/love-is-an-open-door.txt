Love Is an Open Door


ANNA: Okay, can I just, say something crazy?



HANS: I love crazy!



ANNA:

All my life has been a series of doors in my face

And then suddenly I bump into you



HANS:

I was thinking the same thing! â€˜Cause like

I've been searching my whole life to find my own place

And maybe it's the party talking or the chocolate fondue



ANNA: But with you

HANS: But with you



HANS: I found my place

ANNA: I see your face



BOTH:

And it's nothing like I've ever known before

Love is an open door

Love is an open door

Love is an open door



ANNA: With you

HANS: With you

ANNA: With you

HANS: With you



BOTH: Love is an open door



HANS: I mean it's crazy

ANNA: What?



HANS: We finish each other's

ANNA: Sandwiches



HANS: That's what I was gonna say!



ANNA: I've never met someone



BOTH:

Who thinks so much like me

Jinx! Jinx again!

Our mental synchronization

Can have but one explanation



HANS: You

ANNA: And I

HANS: Were

ANNA: Just



BOTH: Meant to be



ANNA: Say goodbye

HANS: Say goodbye



BOTH:

To the pain of the past

We don't have to feel it any more

Love is an open door

Love is an open door

Life can be so much more



ANNA: With you

HANS: With you

ANNA: With you

HANS: With you



BOTH: Love is an open door



HANS: Can I say something crazy? Will you marry me?

ANNA: Can I say something even crazier? Yes!
