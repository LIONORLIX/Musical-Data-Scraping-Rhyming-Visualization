Colder by the Minute


ENSEMBLE:

And born of cold and winter air

The storm inside her grew

The skies closed in, the wind picked up

Her mind grew dark, the cold wind blew



HANS: (spoken)

I charge Queen Elsa of Arendelle with treason, and sentence her to death



ANNA: (spoken)

What? No!



ENSEMBLE:

Nothing could contain

The tempest in her brain



And the storm raged on

And they were ravaged by the wrath of snow

And the wind blew fear

And the storm would grow



Colder by the minute

Colder by the minute



ANNA:

Keep walking Anna, don't stop, don't rest

He's out here somewhere

I can feel the ice in my chest

In my heart, I don't care

I've got to reach you through the storm somehow

Because the one thing that can save me now

Is your love



KRISTOFF:

Anna

Where are you? True love



ENSEMBLE:

Colder by the minute

Colder by the minute



ELSA:

Can't run, can't stop, can't breathe

Can't live and I can't die



HANS:

Elsa, listen



ELSA:

Can't hope to fix this mess

Yet somehow still I have to try



HANS:

Please surrender



ELSA:

Conceal, don't feel, don't feel

Get back into the cage



HANS:

End this winter



ELSA:

I've unleashed a monster

I cannot stop the monster



HANS:

No harm will come to you



ENSEMBLE:

And the north wind howled

And they were trapped within the walls of white



ANNA:

Don't give into the ice

Don't give into the cold



KRISTOFF:

Anna

If you can hear my voice

Hold on Anna



ANNA:

True love



ELSA:

I can't!



HANS:

Elsa!



ENSEMBLE:

And the storm raged on

And nature tore the world apart!

And all was lost

To the frozen heart



ANNA:

Kristoff



KRISTOFF:

Anna



ELSA:

Monster



HANS:

Elsa



ENSEMBLE:

Colder by the minute

Colder by the minute



HANS: (spoken)

Elsa! You can't run from this!



ELSA: (spoken)

Where is my sister?

Where is Anna?



HANS: (spoken)

Anna! She returned from the mountain weak and cold! You froze her heart!



ELSA:

No



HANS:

I tried to save her, but it was too late. Her skin was ice. Her hair turned white.

You sister is dead. Because of you!



ENSEMBLE:

And the wind blew soft

And in her grief, the storm stood still



ANNA: (spoken)

Kristoff? Elsa?
