When Everything Falls Apart


ANNA: (spoken)

Oh no, Olaf! You're in pieces! This is horrible!



OLAF: (spoken)

Hey, hey, hey! No need to panic!

(singing)

There are times in my life

When I am neither here or there

And I'm a little in a muddle

'Cause my middle's rolled somewhere



Sometimes one arm has flown off

And another's in the grass

And I've one foot in my mouth

And another in my a.....bdomin



When everything falls apart

And I'm as broken as can be

I don't get devastated when decapitated

No, it just helps me see differently

Yes!



When everything falls apart

And the winds of fate seem cruel

What I'm most afraid of

Shows me what I'm made of

Which turns out to be pretty cool



When I'm scattered

'Cause I'm shattered

And I'm good for who knows what

I know I'll always catch a break

As sure as I can catch my butt



KRISTOFF: (spoken)

Woops!



ANNA: (spoken)

There it goes!



OLAF: (spoken)

Throw me! WOAH!



OLAF:

When everything falls apart

And it's an awful, awful day

To sum up my thesis, when I fall to pieces

It's a chance to look around and say

I'm gonna pull myself together in a better way



ANNA: (spoken)

That's great, Olaf! But what about Arendelle?

I can't go back there with the weather like this!

And how do I defend Elsa to them?

I can't let my people down, but-



KRISTOFF: (spoken)

Hey, hey, hey



KRISTOFF:

When everything falls apart

And all your witts are at their end

Yes in the midst of stressing

There's a hidden blessing



OLAF:

You can be depressing with a friend



KRISTOFF:

When a reindeer herder finds a reindeer

Left behind to die

The reindeer herder saves his life

And the deer makes him a better guy



ANNA: (spoken)

Aww



OLAF: (spoken)

I'm gonna cry



KRISTOFF:

When everything falls apart

It's just the world re-shuffling



OLAF:

Shuffling



KRISTOFF:

It can lead to more friends



OLAF:

Maybe three or four friends



ANNA:

And all the good that can bring



KRISTOFF, ANNA, OLAF:

When things fall apart



ANNA:

Don't worry about a thing



KRISTOFF: (spoken)

Except maybe worry about your hair?



ANNA: (spoken)

What? I just fell off a cliff you should see your hair



KRISTOFF: (spoken)

No. Yours is turning white



ANNA: (spoken)

White? It's what? Does it look bad?



KRISTOFF: (spoken)

No



OLAF: (spoken)

You hesitated



KRISTOFF: (spoken)

No I didn't



OLAF: (spoken)

You did hesitate



KRISTOFF: (spoken)

Not in that way! It's because your sister struck you, isn't it?

Wait! I have an idea



KRISTOFF:

There's some friends out in the woods I know

They'll tell us what to do



ANNA:

Why would you stay out here and risk your life?



OLAF:

Because we care about you



ANNA: (spoken)

You do?



OLAF, KRISTOFF: (spoken)

We do!



ANNA: (spoken)

Huh, that's new



OLAF:

When everything's going bad



ANNA:

And you don't know where to start



ANNA, KRISTOFF, OLAF:

It's looking grim it's true

But I've got you and you

And that's enough to warm my heart



ANNA:

Til the next time



OLAF:

Til the next time



KRISTOFF:

Til the next time



ANNA, KRISTOFF, OLAF:

When everything falls apart
