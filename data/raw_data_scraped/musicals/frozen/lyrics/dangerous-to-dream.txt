Dangerous to Dream


Elsa:

I can't be what you expect of me

And I'm trying every day with all I do

And do not say

Here on the edge of the abyss

Knowing everything in my whole life has lead to this



And so I pull inside myself

Close the walls put up my guard

I've practised every single day for this

So why is it so hard



'Cause I can't show you

I'm not as cold as I seem

There are things you cannot know

And it's dangerous to dream



[Anna: Sorry I'm late!]



I know I'll never see that sunny day

When this trial is finally through,

And it could just be me and you

I can't dwell on what we've lost

And our secrecy and silence comes at such a cost



I wish I could tell the truth

Show you who's behind the door

I wish you knew what all this pantomime

and pageantry was for



I have to be so cautious

And you're so extreme

We're different, you and I

And it's dangerous to dream



It's dangerous to wish

I could make choices of my own

Dangerous to even have that thought



I'm dangerous just standing here

For everyone to see

If I let go of rules

Who knows how dangerous I'd be?



...



I can't believe that I'm standing here

Did I really make it through?

Father, I did it

Now I'm tied to you



I can't stop smiling, how strange

Does this mean that things are different?

Could they really change?



And could I open up the door

And finally see you face to face

I guess the queen can change the rules

But not the reasons they're in place



I can't be what you expect of me

And I'm not what I seem

But I would love to know you

Is it dangerous to dream?
