Hard-Knock Life


[ORPHANS]

It's the hard-knock life for us!

It's the hard-knock life for us!



[ANNIE]

'Steada treated,



[ORPHANS]

We get tricked!



[ANNIE]

'Steada kisses,



[ORPHANS]

We get kicked!



[ALL]

It's the hard-knock life!

Got no folks to speak of, so,

It's the hard-knock row we hoe!



[ANNIE]

Cotton blankets,



[ORPHANS]

'Steada of wool!



[ANNIE]

Empty Bellies



[ORPHANS]

'Steada of full!



[ALL]

It's the hard-knock life!



[ANNIE]

Don't it feel like the wind is always howl'n?



[KATE AND TESSIE]

Don't it seem like there's never any light!



[DUFFY AND JULY]

Once a day, don't you wanna throw the towel in?



[MOLLY AND PEPPER]

It's easier than puttin' up a fight.



[ANNIE]

No one's there when your dreams at night get creepy!

No one cares if you grow...of if you shrink!

No one dries when your eyes get wet an' weepy!



[ALL]

From all the cryin' you would think this place's a sink!

Ohhhh!!!!!!!

Empty belly life!

Rotten smelly life!

Full of sorrow life!

No tomorrow life!



[MOLLY]

Santa Claus we never see



[ANNIE]

Santa Claus, what's that?

Who's he?



[ALL]

No one cares for you a smidge

When you're in an orphanage!



[MOLLY]

(Making a whistling sound and imitating Miss. Hannigan)

You'll stay up till this dump shines

like the top of the Chrysler Building.



[ORPHANS]

Yank the whiskers from her chin

Jab her with a safety Pin

Make her drink a mickey finn

I love you, Miss Hannigan



[MOLLY]

(whistle) Get to work!

(whistle) Strip them beds!

(whistle) I said get to work!



[ALL]

It's the hard-knock life for us

It's the hard-knock life for us

No one cares for you a smidge

When your in an orphanage

It's the hard-knock life

It's the hard-knock life

It's the hard-knock life!
