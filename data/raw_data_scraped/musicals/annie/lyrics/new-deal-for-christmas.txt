New Deal for Christmas


[WARBUCKS]

I know the Depression's depressing



[GRACE]

The carols are stilled

The stored aren't filled



[WARBUCKS]

And the windows are minus the dressing



[GRACE]

The children don't grin

The Santa's are thin



[GRACE AND WARBUCKS]

And I've heard a terrible rumour

No goodwill no cheer



[WARBUCKS]

But we'll get a new deal for Christmas

This year



[ANNIE AND ORPHANS]

The snowflakes are frighting of falling



[MOLLY]

And oh, what a fix

No peppermint sticks!



[WARBUCKS]

And all through the land folks are bawling



[GRACE]

And filled with despair

'Cause cupboards are bare



[WARBUCKS]

But Santa's got brand new assistants

There's nothing to fear

They're bringing a new deal deal for Christmas

This year.



[SERVANTS]

Bong, bong, bong, bong

Bong, bong, bong, bong



[ROOSEVELT]

On Farley and Perkins

On Ikes and Wallace

On Monganthau and Cummings.



[ALL]

Fill our pockets with dollars



[ROOSEVELT]

On Roper and Swanson



[ROOSEVELT AND WARBUCKS]

Get along Cordell Hull



[ORPHANS]

Get along, giddy up!



[MEN]

Call your committee up



[WOMEN]

Build every city up



[ALL]

Cheer every kiddy up

Fill every stocking with laughter

We haven't got room for any more gloom

Let's ring every bell from it's rafter



[WARBUCKS]

And chime cross the land



[ANNIE]

Tomorrow's at hand



[WARBUCKS]

[spoken] Those happy days that we were promised.



[ROOSEVELT]

Are finally here



[ALL]

We're getting a new deal for Christmas

We're getting a new deal for Christmas

We're getting a new deal for Christmas

We're getting a new deal for Christmas

Christmas

This year
