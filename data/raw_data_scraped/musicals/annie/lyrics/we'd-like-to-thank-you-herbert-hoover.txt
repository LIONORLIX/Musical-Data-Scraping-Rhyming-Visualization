We'd Like to Thank You Herbert Hoover


[ALL]

Today we're living in a shanty

Today we're scrounding for a meal



[SOPHIE]

Today I'm stealing coal for fires

Who knew i could steal?



[MEN]

I used to winter in the tropics



[WOMEN]

I spent my summers at the shore



[FRED]

I used to throw away the paper--



[ALL]

We'd like to thank you: Herber Hoover

For really showing us the way

We'd like to thank you: Herbert Hoover

You made us what we are today



Prosperity was 'round the corner

The cozy cottage built for two

In this blue heaven

That you

Gave us

Yes!



We're turning blue!

They offered us Al Smith and Hoover

We paid attention and we chose

Not only did we pay attention

We paid through the nose.



In ev'ry pt he said "a chicken"

But Herbert Hoover he forgot

Not only don't we have the chicken

We ain't got the pot!

Hey Herbie



[WOMEN]

You left behind a greatful nation



[ALL]

So, Herb, our hats are off to you

We're up to here with admiration



[SOPHIE]

Come down and have a little stew



[ALL]

Come down and share some Christmas dinner

Be sure to bring the missus too

We got no turkey for our stuffing

We'd like to thank you, Herbert Hoover

For really showing us the way

You dirty rat, you Bureaucrat, you

Made us what we are today

Come and get it, Herb!
