NYC


[WARBUCKS]

What is it about you

You're big

You're loud

You're tough NYC

I go years without you

Then I

Can't get

Enough

Enough of the cab drivers answering back

In the language far from pure

Enough of frankfurters answering back

Brother, you know you're in NYC

Too busy

Too crazy

Too hot

Too cold

Too late

I'm sold

Again

On NYC



[spoken] Come on you slowpokes,

we gotta get to the Roxy before the prices change.



[NEW YORKERS, GRACE, ANNIE AND WARBUCKS]

NYC



[GRACE]

The shadows at sundown

The roofs

That scrape

The sky



[ALL]

NYC



[WARBUCKS AND GRACE]

The rich and the rundown

The parade

Goes by



[WARBUCKS]

That other town has the Empire State

And a mayor five foot two

No other town in

The whole forty eight

Can half compare

To you



[ALL]

Oh NYC



[WARBUCKS]

You make 'em all postcards



[WARBUCKS AND GRACE]

You crowd

You cramp

You're still

The champ

Amen For NYC (NYC)

The shimmer of Times Square



[WARBUCKS]

The pulse



[GRACE]

The beat



[WARBUCKS AND GRACE]

The drive! (NYC)



[WARBUCKS AND GRACE]

The city's bright

As a penny arcade

It blinks, it tilts, it rings



[ANNIE]

To think that I've lived here all of my life

And never seen these things



[ALL]

Oh, NYC

The whole world keeps coming



[WARBUCKS]

By bus



[GRACE]

By train



[WARBUCKS AND GRACE]

You can't

Explain

Their yen

For



STAR TO BE

NYC

Just got here this morning

Three bucks

Two bags

One me

NYC



I give you fair warning

Up there

In lights

I'll be

Go ask the Gershwins or Kaufman and Hart

The place they love the best

Though California pays big for their art

Their fan mail comes addressed to NYC

Tomorrow a penthouse

That's way up high

Tonight

The "Y"

Why not

It's NYC



[ALL]

NYC

You're standing room only

You crowd

You cramp

You're still

The champ

Amen For NY



[MAN]

[spoken] Keep it quiet down there!



[ALL (QUIETLY)]

NYC



[USHERETTE]

[spoken] Immediate seating... there is immediate seating.



[WARBUCKS]

[spoken] Popcorn, what do you say to some popcorn?

I haven't had popcorn since... (Annie yawns)



[singing] Give in

Don't fight

Good girl

Good night

Sleep tight

In NYC
