You're Never Fully Dressed Without a Smile (Children Reprise)


[TESSIE]

[spoken] So, for all of the "Hours of Smiles" Family,

this is Bert Healy saying...

[singing] Hey hobo man,

Hey Dapper Dan,

You've both got your style



[ALL ORPHANS]

But brother, you're never fully dressed

Without a smile

Your clothes may be Beau Brummelly

They stand out a mile

But brother you're never fully dressed

Without a smile



[JULY]

[spoken] Who cares what they're wearing

on Main Street of Saville Row

It's what you wear from ear to ear

And not from head to toe.



[MOLLY]

That matters



[TESSIE]

[spoken] Ah. the lovely Boylan Sisters.



[DUFFY, KATE AND PEPPER]

Doo doodle-oo doo

Doo doodle-oo doo

Doo doo doo doo

Doo doo doo



[ALL ORPHANS]

Who cares what they're wearing on Main Street

or Saville Row

It's what you wear from ear to ear

And not from head to toe that matters

So, Senator, so, janitor

So long for a while

Remember you're never fully dressed

Though you may wear the best

You're never fully dressed without a

Smile

Smile

Smile!!!

Smile darn ya, smile.
