Maybe


[ANNIE]

Maybe far away

Or maybe real nearby

He may be pouring her coffee

She may be straighting his tie!

Maybe in a house

All hidden by a hill

She's sitting playing piano,

He's sitting paying a bill!



Betcha they're young

Betcha they're smart

Bet they collect things

Like ashtrays, and art!

Betcha they're good --

(Why shouldn't they be?)

Their one mistake

Was giving up me!



So maybe now it's time,

And maybe when I wake

They'll be there calling me "Baby"...

Maybe.



Betcha he reads

Betcha she sews

Maybe she's made me

A closet of clothes!

Maybe they're strict

As straight as a line...

Don't really care

As long as they're mine!



So maybe now this prayer's

The last one of it's kind...

Won't you please come get your "Baby"



[ANNIE AND ORPHANS]
