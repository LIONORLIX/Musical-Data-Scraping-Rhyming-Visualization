Cantiamo d'Amore (We Sing of Love)


[All]:



We sing of love, we sing only of love

Oh ye Gods above, may we never sing of anything but love

For love is the joy of every girl and boy

And love later on keeps us going till we're gone

Love is the theme of all people who dream,

so love lets confess, is everybody's business!

Oh ye Gods above, may we never sing of anything but love



[Soloists]:

I won't sing a song about battle

I won't sing of babies who prattle

I get no glee from songs about the sea

Or cowboy songs about cattle

I won't waste a note of my patters

On socially significant matters



[All]:

We sing of one thing and we adore it!

Thank heaven for it!

We sing of love, we sing only of love.

Oh ye Gods above, may we never sing of anything but love.



[Bianca]:

For love is the joy of every girl and boy

And love later on keeps us going till we're gone



[Lucentio]:

Love is the theme of all people who dream, so love lets confess is everybody's business!



[All]:

Oh ye Gods above may we never sing of anything but love, sweet love!
