Why Can't You Behave?


LOIS LANE:

Why can't you behave?

Oh, why can't you behave?

After all the things you told me

And the promises that you gave,

Oh, why can't you behave?

Why can't you be good?

And do just as you should?

Won't you turn that new leaf over

So your baby can be your slave?

Oh, why can't you behave?



There's a farm I know near my old home town,

Where we two can go and try settlin' down.

There I'll care for you forever,

Well, at least 'til you dig my grave.

Oh, why can't you behave?



BILL:

Gee, I need you, kid!



LOIS LANE:

I always knew you did,

But why can't you behave?
