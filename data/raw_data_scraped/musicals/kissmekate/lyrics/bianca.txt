Bianca


BILL:

While rehearsing with Bianca

(She's the darling I adore),

Offstage I found

She's been around

But I still love her more and more;

So I've written her a love song

Though I'm just an amateur.

I'll sing it through

For all of you

To see if it's worthy of her.

Are yuh list'nin'?



Bianca, Bianca,

Oh, baby, will you be mine?

Bianca, Bianca,

You'd better answer yes or Poppa spanka.

To win you, Bianca,

There's nothing I would not do.

I would gladly give up coffee for Sanka,

Even Sanka, Bianca, for you.
