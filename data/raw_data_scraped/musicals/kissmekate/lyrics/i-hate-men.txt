I Hate Men


KATHARINE:

I hate men.

I can't abide 'em even now and then.

Than ever marry one of them, I'd rest a virgin rather,

For husbands are a boring lot and only give you bother.

Of course, I'm awfully glad that Mother had to marry Father,

But I hate men.

Of all the types I've ever met within our democracy,

I hate most the athlete with his manner bold and brassy,

He may have hair upon his chest but, sister, so has Lassie.

Oh, I hate men!

I hate men.

Their worth upon this earth I dinna ken.

Avoid the trav'ling salesman though a tempting

Tom he may be,

From China he will bring you jade and perfume from Araby,

But don't forget 'tis he who'll have the fun and thee the baby,

Oh I hate men.

If thou shouldst wed a businessman, be wary, oh, be wary.

He'll tell you he's detained in town on business necessary,

His bus'ness is the bus'ness which he gives his secretary,

Oh I hate men!
