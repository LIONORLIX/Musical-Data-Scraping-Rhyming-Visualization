Boundaries


[USHER]

Why did I do that?

What did that do for me?

What a performance

Where are my boundaries?



I?threw?my hands up

He?blew my house down

All I ever?wanted was to jump off of a precipice

Launch my golden parachute

A win for the record book

Thought I had what it took

Not as smart as I look

Because now I'm practically in traction

Why did I do that?

Down on my hands and knees

Why play submissive?

What are my boundaries?



Thought it would learn me

If I let it burn me

All I ever wanted was to show that I was tough enough

Big enough and strong enough

To slow down a speeding train

Outrun the bulls in Spain

I swerved outside my lane

My brakes went out, and now I'm broken



Still I beat myself up

Still I knock myself down

And still I flip myself off in the mirror

Which makes me feel really bad

Which makes me feel really good

Which makes me feel like the stupidest asshole



Rubber wants to hit the open road

But I keep dwelling on the past

I pray that some day I will change

Stranger things have happened

Each time I try to chart my course

Wild horses throw me off by force

The same old story

Lurching after glory

And I fall short



Why do I do this?

Bow down and people please?

I can't know freedom

Without clear boundaries

'Til I draw boundaries

I have no boundaries
