Tyler Perry Writes Real Life


[AGENT FAIRWEATHER, spoken]

I know it's been months since we last spoke, and I have no idea if?this?is of any?interest to you, or if you?have any materials to send, but, we just got a call for submissions for something very exciting, especially for you



[USHER, spoken]

Oh yeah? What is it?



[Chorus]

Tyler Perry

Tyler Perry

Tyler Perry!

[USHER, spoken]

Oh, no!



[Chorus]

Tyler Perry

Tyler Perry

Tyler Perry!



[THOUGHT]

Hell no!



[AGENT FAIRWEATHER, spoken]

It seems he's gotten so busy with film and TV that his team is looking to farm out the gospel plays to a ghostwriter. It'll be a scream! And didn't you once tell me that your mother would love nothing more than for you to write one? So, how 'bout it, Ush? Just write a sassy, matriarchal, lonely spinster who loves God. Throw in a few Color Purple quotes! Whaddya say?



[USHER]

Thank you for the opportunity...



[AGENT FAIRWEATHER, spoken]

Of course! Of course



[USHER]

But Tyler would be none too fond of me



[AGENT FAIRWEATHER, spoken]

Don't sell yourself short!

[USHER]

The crap he puts on stage, film and TV

Makes my bile want to rise!



[AGENT FAIRWEATHER, spoken]

I know, I know, your "integrity."



[USHER]

Nothing that he writes seems real to me



[AGENT FAIRWEATHER, spoken]

Yes, you think he sucks, uh huh



[USHER]

Just simple-minded hack buffoonery!



[AGENT FAIRWEATHER, spoken]

But no theaters will touch you



[USHER]

And if I try to match his coonery

He'd see through my disguise



It's true, I'm still emerging

Looking to make my start

But not so hungry that I'd ride the chitlin circuit

I'm into entertainment

That's undercover art

My mission is to figure out just how to work it

Today...

Today, I plan to change this scene for the better-



(spoken)

Hello? Agent Fairweather? Are you there?



[ANCESTORS, spoken]

Race traitor!

Race traitor!

Race traitor!



[USHER, spoken]

"Race traitor?" Who's there?



[HARRIET TUBMAN, spoken]

I'm Harriet motherfuckin' Tubman, and I got a problem with you!



[CARTER G. WOODSON, spoken]

I'm Carter G. motherfuckin' Woodson, and I've got a problem with you, too!



[JAMES BALDWIN, spoken]

Jimmy Baldwin!



[ZORA NEALE HUSTON, spoken]

Zora Neale Huston!



[12 YEARS A SLAVE]

12 Years a Slave, here!



[WHITNEY HOUSTON, spoken]

Whitney!



[USHER, spoken]

What do you want with me?



[WHITNEY HOUSTON, spoken]

To get you together! Make me get my black ass up outta my $20 grave to put your black ass on blast, talkin' bad about Tyler Perry!



[ANCESTORS]

Who the fuck is you, nigga?

You look it, but you ain't no true nigga!

You make us ancestors blue

Actin' brand new

Nigga, I can't with you!



Tyler is a real nigga

And not a cracker-pleasing seal, nigga!

He writes how our people feel

With him at the wheel

Nigga, what can't we do?



Cause Tyler Perry writes real life!

Tyler Perry writes real life!

He writes stories we can swallow

Like Popeyes chicken and biscuits!

He writes stories we can follow

Like we follow the drinking gourd!

He writes stories 'bout fat, black women with weaves

Finding love and redemption

With muscle-bound black men who own their own business

And truly love the Lord

And truly love the Lord!



So, if you won't follow through, nigga

I'll SMDH at you, nigga



[WHITNEY]

Cause

And just as somebody

Trying to tell everybody

That you ain't nobody, nigga, so

Get off the stage

And let



[ANCESTORS]

Tyler Perry write real life

Cause Tyler Perry writes real life!
