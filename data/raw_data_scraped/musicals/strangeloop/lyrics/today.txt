Today


[USHER]

I am a Disney usher

I'm barely scraping by

My discontentment comes in many shapes and sizes

When?I?wake up each?morning

I tell myself to try

I tell?myself that I will make no compromises



Today...



A meeting with my landlord

Who makes me miss my train

And I smell awful cause there is no time to shower

I plaster on a smile

Pretend I have no brain

Make nice with asshole tourists hour after hour

Today...



Today, I plan to change my whole life forever



[THOUGHT, spoken]

Usher, surprise! How you doin'? It's your daily self-loathing! I had some time to kill, so I thought I'd stop by to remind you just how truly worthless you are!



[THOUGHT, spoken]

Hey Usher, how you doin'? It's your financial faggotry and ooh, child! Do you have a second to discuss this situation with Shitty Bank Student Loans?

Define a formal structure

So people understand

Pull out the stops to show the story's full potential



Today...



Today, I plan to change this show for the better

[THOUGHT, spoken]

Usher, as supervisor of your sexual ambivalence, you can rest assured that I've sealed the gates of your body and mind so that nothing can get inside your shitty butthole until you give the word

[USHER]

I want to break the cycle

That's so ingrained in me

But change comes way too slow and I am in a hurry

There's all of this rejection

Which brings such misery

But with my white girl music, I drown out the flurry of



Today...



I am a Disney usher

I'm barely scraping by

My discontentment comes in many shapes and sizes

When I wake up each morning

I tell myself to try

I tell myself that I will make no compromises



So days like this just get me

I hate days like today

Days when I face myself, but see the same reflection

Someone who's stuck rewriting

And stuck in his own way

Someone who has to edit every imperfection



Today...

Today I plan to change myself-



[THOUGHT, spoken]

Okay, girl. Whatever
