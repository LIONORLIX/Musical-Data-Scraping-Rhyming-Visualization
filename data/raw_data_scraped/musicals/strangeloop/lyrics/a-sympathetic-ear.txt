A Sympathetic Ear


[PATRON]

I like this, and I like Wicked

I come up every year to see my shows

I'm?from?Miami Beach, you?know, in Florida

Like Dorothy, Blanche, Sophia,?and Rose



All my life, I've lived for others

Made space for every dream except my own

But then one day, I looked into the mirror

And saw that I was old and all alone

So my advice, don't play nice

Don't look back and don't think twice

Don't let doubt get in the way of what you want

Just roll the dice

Stay the course, seize the day

Ride your horse into the fray

Live your life and tell your story

In exactly the same way:

Truthfully, and without fear

To spite those who wish you'd disappear

Find joy inside your life while you're still here

That's your challenge from a sympathetic ear



(spoken)

If you're not scared to write the truth, then it's probably not worth writing. And if you're not scared of living the truth, then it's probably not worth living
