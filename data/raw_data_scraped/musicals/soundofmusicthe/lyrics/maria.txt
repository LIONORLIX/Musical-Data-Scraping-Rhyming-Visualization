Maria


BERTHE:

She climbs a tree

And scrapes her knee

Her dress has got a tear.



SOPHIA:

She waltzes on her way to mass

And whistles on the stair.



BERTHE:

And underneath her wimpole

She has curlers in her hair!



SOPHIA:

I ever hear her singing in the abbey.



BERTHE:

She's always late for chapel,



MARGARETTA:

But her penitence is real.



BERTHE:

She's always late for everything,

Except for every meal.



MOTHER ABBESS:

I hate to have to say it

But I very firmly feel



BERTHE AND SOPHIA:

Maria's not an asset to the abbey!



MARGARETTA:

I'd like to say a word in her behalf.

Maria makes me laugh!



SOPHIA:

How do you solve a problem like Maria?



MOTHER ABBESS:

How do you catch a cloud and pin it down?



MARGARETTA:

How do you find a word that means Maria?



BERTHE:

A flibberti gibbet!



SOPHIA:

A willo' the wisp!



MARGARETTA:

A clown!



MOTHER ABBESS:

Many a thing you know you'd like to tell her,

Many a thing she ought to understand.



MARGARETTA:

But how do you make her stay

And listen to all you say,



MOTHER ABBESS:

How do you keep a wave upon the sand?



MARGARETTA:

Oh, how do you solve a problem like Maria?



MOTHER ABBESS:

How do you hold a moonbeam in your hand?



MARGARETTA:

When I'm with her I'm confused,

Out of focus and bemused,

And I never know exactly where I am.



SOPHIA:

Unpredictable as weather,

She's as flighty as a feather,



MARGARETTA:

She's a darling,



BERTHE:

She's a demon,



MARGARETTA:

She's a lamb.



SOPHIA:

She'd out-pester any pest,

Drive a hornet from his nest,



BERTHE:

She can throw a whirling dervish

Out of whirl.



MARGARETTA:

She is gentle,

She is wild,



SOPHIA:

She's a riddle.



MARGARETTA:

She's a child.



BERTHE:

She's a headache!



MARGARETTA:

She's an angel!



MOTHER ABBESS:

She's a girl.



ALL NUNS:

How do you solve a problem like Maria?

How do you catch a clown and pin it down?

How do you find a word that means Maria?

A flibberti gibbet!

A willo' the wisp!

A clown!

Many a thing you know you'd like to tell her,

Many a thing she ought to understand.

But how do you make her say,

And listen to all you say?

How do you keep a wave upon the sand?

Oh, how do you solve a problem like Maria?

How do you hold a moonbeam in your hand?
