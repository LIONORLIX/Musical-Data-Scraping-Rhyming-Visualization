Sound of Music


MARIA:

My day in the hills

Has come to an end, I know.

A star has come out

To tell me it's time to go.

But deep in the dark green shadows,

There are voices that urge me to stay.

So I pause and I wait and I listen,

For one more sound,

For one more lovely thing

That the hills might say!

The hills are alive

With the sound of music,

With songs they have sung,

For a thousand years.

The hills fill my heart,

With the sound of music.

My heart wants to sing every song it hears.

My heart wants to beat like the wings

Of the birds that rise from the lake

To the trees.

My heart wants to sigh

Like a chime that flies

From a church on a breeze,

To laugh like a brook when it trips and falls

Over stones on its way

To sing through the night,

Like a lark who is learning to pray.

I go to the hills

When my heart is lonely.

I know I will hear

What I heard before.

My heart will be blessed

With the sound of music

And I'll sing once more.
