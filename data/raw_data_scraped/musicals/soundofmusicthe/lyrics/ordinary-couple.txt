Ordinary Couple


An ordinary couple

Is all we'll ever be,

For all I want of living

Is to keep you close to me,

To laugh and weep together

While time goes on its flight,

To kiss you ev'ry morning

An to kiss you ev'ry night.

We'll meet our daily problems

And rest when day is done,

Our arms around each other

In the fading sun.

An ordinary couple,

Across the years we'll ride,

Our arms around each other

Our children by our side;

Our arms around each other.
