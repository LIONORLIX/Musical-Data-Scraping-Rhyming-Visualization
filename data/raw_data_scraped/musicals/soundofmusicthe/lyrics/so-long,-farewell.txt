So Long, Farewell


THE CHILDREN:

There's a sad sort of clanking

From the clock in the hall

And the bells in the steeple too.

And up in the nursery an absurd little bird

Is popping up to say cukoo!

Cukoo! Cukoo!

Regretfully they tell us



But firmly they compel us

To say goodbye to you.



So long

Farewell

Aufwiedersehn

Goodnight

I hate to go and leave this pretty sight



So long

Farewell

Aufwiedersehn

Adeiu

Adeiu Adeiu

To yieu and yieu and yieu



So long

Farewell

Au 'voire

Aufwiedersehn

I'd like to stay and taste my first champagne



So long

Farewell

Aufwiedersehn

Goodbye

I leave and heave a sigh and say goodbye



Goodbye!



I'm glad to go I cannot tell a lie

I flit I float

I fleetly flee I fly



The sun has gone to bed and so must I

So long Farewell

Aufwiedersehn

Goodbye--



Goodbye...

Goodbye...

Goodbye...

Goodbye...
