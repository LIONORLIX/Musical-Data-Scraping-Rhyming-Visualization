Edelweiss, Edelweiss

Every morning you greet me

Small and white clean and bright

You look happy to meet me

Blossom of snow may you bloom and grow

Bloom and grow forever

Edelweiss,Edelweiss

Bless my homeland forever.

Blossom of snow may you bloom and grow

Bloom and grow forever

Edelweiss,Edelweiss

Bless my homeland forever.
