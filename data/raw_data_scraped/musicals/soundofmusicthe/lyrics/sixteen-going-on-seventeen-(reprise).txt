Sixteen Going on Seventeen (Reprise)


[Maria:]

You are sixteen going on seventeen

Waiting for life to start

Somebody kind who touches your mind

Will suddenly touch your heart



[Liesl:]

When that happens, after it happens

Nothing is quite the same

Somehow I know I'll jump up and go

If ever he calls my name



[Maria:]

Gone are your old ideas of life

The old ideas grow dim

Lo and behold you're someone's wife

And you belong to him



You may think this kind of adventure

Never may come to you

Darling sixteen going on seventeen

Wait a year . . .



[Liesl:]

I'll wait a year . . .



[Maria:]

Just wait a year . . .



[Maria and Liesl:]

Or two
