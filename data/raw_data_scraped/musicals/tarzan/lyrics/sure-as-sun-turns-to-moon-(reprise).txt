Sure As Sun Turns To Moon (Reprise)


KALA:

As sure as sun turns to moon,

You'll be with us,

Always here, protecting us still.

You will.

I know you will.

You're my husband, my friend, our leader. You're the one that I love completely.

You are.

You know you are.



TARZAN:

There is no other way.
