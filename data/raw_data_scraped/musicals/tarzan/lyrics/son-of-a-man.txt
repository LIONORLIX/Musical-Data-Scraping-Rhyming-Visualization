Son of a Man


Terk:

Hah!



Terk:

Ohh, the power to be strong

And the wisdom to be wise

All these things will come to you in time

On this journey that you're making

There'll be answers that you'll see

And it's you who'll find a mountain

It's you who'll reach the peak



Chorus:

Son of man look to the sky

Let your spirits set you free

Someday you'll walk tall with pride

Son of man

A man in time you'll be



Terk:

I'll be right here to guide you

And turn to take your hand

With fate and understanding

You will journey from boy to man



Chorus



Terk & Kala:

In learning you will teach

And in teaching you will learn

You'll find your place beside the ones

You love!



Ensemble:

Oh, and all the things you dreamed of



Terk:

All the visions that you saw



Ensemble:

And the time is drawing in now



Terk:

It's your's to claim it all



Chorus



Ensemble:

Ooh weh



Terk:

mmm yay-o



(continues on until...)



Terk:

Son of man



Ensemble:

Son of man

Son of man

Son of man for all to see!
