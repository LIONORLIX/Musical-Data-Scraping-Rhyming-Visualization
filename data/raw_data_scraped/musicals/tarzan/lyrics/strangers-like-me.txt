Strangers Like Me


TARZAN

Whatever you do

I’ll do it, too

Show me everything and tell me how

It all means something and yet nothing to me



Oh I can see there’s so much to learn

It’s all so close and yet so far!

I see myself as others see me

Oh I just know there’s something bigger out there



I wanna know;

Can you show me?

I wanna know about these strangers like me

Tell me more, please show me

Something’s familiar about these strangers like me



Every gesture, every move that she makes

Makes me feel like never before

Why do I have this growing need to be beside her?



All these emotions I never knew

Some other world beyond this place

Beyond the trees, above the clouds

Oh, I see, before me, a new horizon



I wanna know;

Can you show me’

I wanna know about these strangers like me

Tell me more, please show me

Something’s familiar about these strangers like me



Come with me, now, to see my world

Where there’s beauty beyond your dreams

Can you feel the things I feel right now with you’



Take my hand

There’s a world you need to know



JANE

I can't explain the way I feel

Everything I want, it’s here

And my heart is beating faster

Every moment I’m with him

I feel so complete

I cannot deny what I’m feeling



TARZAN

I wanna know;

Can you show me’

I wanna know about these strangers like me

Tell me more, please show me

Something’s familiar about these strangers like me

I wanna know!
