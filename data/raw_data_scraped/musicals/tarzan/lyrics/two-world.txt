Two World


Put your faith in what you most believe in

Two worlds, one family

Trust your heart

Let fate decide

To guide these lives we see



Put your faith in what you most believe in

Two worlds, one family

Trust your heart

Let fate decide

To guide these lives we see



A paradise untouched by man

Within this world blessed with love

A simple life, they live in peace



Softly tread the sand below your feet now

Two worlds, one family

Trust your heart

Let fate decide

To guide these lives we see



Beneath the shelter of the trees

Only love can enter here

A simple life, they live in peace



Raise your head up

Lift high the load

Take strength from those that need you

Build high the walls

Build stronger beams

A new life is waiting

But danger's no stranger here



No words describe a mother's tears

No words can heal a broken heart

The dream is gone, but then there's hope

Someone is calling for you

Two worlds, one family

Trust your heart

Let fate decide

To guide these lives we see



With every ending comes a new beginning

Two worlds, one family

Trust your heart

Let fate decide

To guide these lives

To guide these lives we see



Put your faith in what you most believe in

Two worlds, one family
