My Daughter Is Catherine


Senator Ruth Martin:

(spoken)

I'm speaking now to the person who's holding my daughter,



(sung)

This isn't your fault,

And you aren't to blame,

It's rough when you're misunderstood

My daughter is Catherine,

Catherine's her name,



And know that within you there's good

You have the power to prove to the world,

That you can be normal, don't hurt my girl,

Reframe from your bloodthirsty urgence to name,

My daughter is Catherine,

Catherine's her name,



You're strong, you're the boss,

And you're holding the curves,

I know that you're hurting, we all have our scars,

I can make you a hero, come claim your reward!

Catherine, Catherine, Catherine, Catherine, Catherine, Catherine,

Catherine's her name



(spoken)

Clarice:

That's really smart



Ardelia:

What?



Clarice:

Repeating her name over and over like that,

Makes Catherine a real person,

Not just some object so it makes it harder for him to harm her,

So smart



Ardelia:

So smart,

So very, very smart



(sung)

Senator Ruth Martin:

Catherine used to ride horses,

Catherine used to sing songs,

Surely you know what you're doing is wrong,

Talk to my Catherine, Catherine's gentle, you'll see,

You're problems are mental, please set Catherine free,





I'm sure I can give you whatever you seek,

You can be mercyful, pity the weak!

Prove you're above all the rest of my freaks,

You're a misquided lion who needs to be tamed,

Our trust and respect, they're both yours to be gained,

My daughter is Catherine,

Catherine, Catherine, beautiful Catherine, humanbeing Catherine, Catherine, Catherine, Catherine,

Catherine's her name!
