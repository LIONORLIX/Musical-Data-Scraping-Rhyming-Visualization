Papa Shtarling:

Clarice?

Pumpkin cookie?



Clarice:

Papa?

Papa, is that you?

Papa, can you hear me?



Papa Shtarling:

Hey, little lady, remember me?

It's papa Shtarling, don't you cry,

I used to pick you up and spin you,

Now keep your chin up, you can fly



Clarice:

Oh papa, I just...



Papa Shtarling:

Ssh....

Just hang in there, kiddo,

You're doin' great



Clarice:

Papa, are you okay?



Papa Shtarling:

It's very lonely being dead,

Just thought I'd come to say hello,

Hope you enjoy this painful flashback,

But now it's time for me to go



Clariec:

I miss you so much papa



Papa Shtarling:

It's very lonely being dead
