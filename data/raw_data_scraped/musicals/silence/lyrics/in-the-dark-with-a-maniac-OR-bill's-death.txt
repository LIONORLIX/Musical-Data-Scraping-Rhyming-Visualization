In The Dark With A Maniac / Bill's Death


[Clarice]

Who turned out the lights?

I can't see a thing

Don't want to play games

With this sick dingaling.



[Buffalo Bill]

These goggles I'm wearing

Make everything green

I can practically touch her

Without being seen!



[Clarice]

I'm creeping around in the dark

With a maniac

Can't see him can't hear him

I'm practically blind as a bat

Betcha he'll make me the latest addition

To all of the girls he's whacked

Even though I'm real thin

And the rest of his victims were fat



Is he here? Is he there?

I can't tell if he's near

So I hope he can't see me

I'm shaking with fear.

Should've shot him before he could

Give me his card.



[Bill]

Would you fuck me? I'd fuck me.

I'd fuck me real hard!



[Clarice]

I must have been crazy

For coming here solo

I need reinforcements



[Bill]

Let's play Marco Polo



[Clarice]

I'm creeping around in the dark

With a maniac



[Catherine]

Oh thank goodness I'm saved!



[Clarice]

I can't shoot you unless I can see you

So turn on the lights



[Catherine]

I've been here for days



[Bill]

You'll be lucky to leave here alive with your brains intact



[Catherine]

In this hideous cave



[Clarice]

Let's both act our age

And behave and we'll have a fair fight!



[Catherine]

Get me out of this basement you dumb fucking bitch!



[Clarice]

Hold your horses, I'm trying,

I can't find the switch!



[Bill]

She was tracking a killer

Well now look who she found!

Now I'm pulling the trigger

So don't turn around!



[Clarice]

This guy is pure evil

Right down to the core,

His home's filled with corpses

And poodles and gore!



[Chorus]
