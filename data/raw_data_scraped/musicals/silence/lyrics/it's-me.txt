It's Me


[Lecter]

Remember the pen that I saw on the table

I ate it when no one was watching

Now I open my mouth and the pen's here again:

Their security's ripe for the botching.

I'll use it to pick the lock

And mutilate both of these cops.

Though it's not Halloween I've concocted a plan

I'll escape from this prison by wearing a man!



[Police]

Look what he did to this officer's face

He chewed off his cheeks and he sprayed him with mace.

We're all in a tizzy, oh Jesus where is he

Oh where could Hannibal be?



[Lecter]

This cop is already dead -- -it's me!



[Police]

Get this man to a hospital

He's arresting he's shaking he's not gonna make it!



[Lecter]

Somebody get me an Oscar for best phony seizure

Just watch how adeptly I fake it.



[Police]

Get out of the way; have the medics arrived?

One's already dead and one's barely alive

Security sucked, and now we're all fucked

Oh where could Hannibal be?



[Lecter]

This cop is already dead, you'll see.

I'm wearing his face on my head -- it's me.



[Cop 1]

What do I say to a person who just lost his face?

I betcha he'll miss it.



[Cop 2]

That cop has a name -- it's Jim Pembry!

Now tell him he's fine, he looks terrific.



[Police]

Look at that blood

We think he's up there:

The elevator's roof.



[Lecter]

I'm leaving you now

Goodbye and take care

You won't believe this goof.



[Police]

Fire a shot in his knee!

No response; who the hell can this be!?



[Lecter]

I've left the building at last I'm free,



[Police]

Say it isn't so,



[Lecter]

This cop is already dead, you see,



[Police]

Did we just let him go?



[Lecter]

I'm wearing his face on my head...

It's me!!!
