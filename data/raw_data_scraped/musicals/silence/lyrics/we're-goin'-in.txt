We're Goin' In


[FBI]



We're goin' in

We're goin' in

We'll ring the bell and

Arrest this felon

We're goin' in!



We're goin' in

We're goin' in

With decoy flowers

We'll catch this coward,

We're goin' in



And everything'll turn out fine

We got here in the nick of time

We'll take him out

That's the job

Save the girl

Hey no problem!



We're goin' in

We're goin' in

His home's surrounded

He's going down, cause

We're goin' in!



[Crashing]



[Agent]



(spoken)



FBI!



[Silence]



[FBI]



There's no one here

There's no one here

Big splashy entry

This house is empty

There's no one here!



[Clarice]



I'm Agent Staring, FBI

Have you see this girl?



[Buffalo Bill]



No, uh-uh. Why?



[Clarice]



This guy is weird

I don't trust him

Hope I've got the guts to bust him.

I'll bet he's kidnapped Catherine



[Bill]



Was she a great big fat person?

Could this girl be

Any dumber?

Time is up

I've got her number!



[Chorus]



There's no one here

There's no one here

We got it wrong and

Clarice is next

So we better move it along

We'd better finish this song

There's no one here

There's no one here!!
