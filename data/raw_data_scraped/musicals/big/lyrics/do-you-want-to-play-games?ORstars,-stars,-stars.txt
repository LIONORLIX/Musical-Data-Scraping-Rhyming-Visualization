Do You Want to Play Games?/Stars, Stars, Stars


JOSH:

Do you want to play games?

If you do, well that's fine with me

I've got Stratego, Risk, and Go

Bet I even know some games that you don't know

If you want to play games

I've got MYST on a new CD

Must be some fun stuff we could find

'Cause I don't think you've got Parcheesi on your mind

I could turn you on to pinball

Do you like computer chess?

We could shoot a couple of hoops

But you'd have to ditch that dress

Do you want to play games?

Something tells me you're not the type

This isn't what a girl enjoys

This is a lot of stuff for boys

Looking at you I'm thinking

I didn't get the right toys

What other choices do we have tonight?



JOSH:

Stars, I can give you stars

A hundred billion stars in the sky

We can watch them float by

Suns, that's what stars are - suns

With planets by the tons

Where there may be two creatures like us

Gazing back at a million stars

Isn't that a thought that's awesome?

Let me give you stars, stars, stars

Stars, how'd you like your stars?



SUSAN

Very nice.



JOSH

How'd you like to rocket around



SUSAN

With my feet on the ground



JOSH

Stars!



SUSAN

Stars!



JOSH

You and me in stars



SUSAN

Well...!



JOSH

All the while the earth is still spinning

We're spending tonight gazing up



SUSAN

Gazing up



JOSH

At a million stars



SUSAN

At a million stars



JOSH (in counterpoint)

Happy, that's a thought that's awesome

Let me give you stars, stars, stars



SUSAN (in counterpoint)

Don't remember the last time I looked

Well I... all right... okay... give me...

Stars, stars, stars



SUSAN

Stars, here I am in stars

Floating in a warm kind of funk

Out in space in a bunk

In stars, he just gave me stars

I've been looking down for too long

But since I've left the ground

All around are a million stars

I have had a night that's awesome

Thank you for the fun...

And the ring...

And the stars...
