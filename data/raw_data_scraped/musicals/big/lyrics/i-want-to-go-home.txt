I Want to Go Home


JOSH:

This is exciting, an adventure,

I get to see some things that most kids never do.

This guy just took a knife out of his shoe.

I want to go home.



I'm meeting people, they all seem friendly.

So I don't need to feel as lonely as I feared.

That girl who stopped to help me has a beard.

I want to go home.



I made a wish like people do.

The fickle finger of fate

And who it picked was me.

I'd won a prize

Out of the blue

And I feel really special

So now, can I go now?



And I'll just think Startrek,

I'm on a mission.

It's like I'm starring in some 3-D CD-ROM,

So why should I feel anything but calm?

I want to go home.



I want my room,

I want my bed.

I want my mom,

I want to go home.



I want my room,

I want my bed.

I want my mom,

I want to go home...
