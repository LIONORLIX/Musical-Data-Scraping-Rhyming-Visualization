Overture/Can't Wait


JOSH:

How come I couldn't cross my own street

Why was I scared to get to my door

Just 'cause I knew that I have to meet Cynthia Benson

I wish I knew what's happ'ning to me

She's just a girl I know since I'm four

Why do I sweat the moment I see Cynthia Benson

What's the big deal about Cynthia Benson

I wish mom wouldn't bug me

I wish I'd start to grow

I wish mom wouldn't hug me

In front of kids I know

Can't wait till I get older



MRS. BASKIN:

I used to have this sweet little kid

Now there's an alien up in his room

He used to talk now everything's hid

Something is changing



Here's where a stage of parenthood ends

We were so close then suddenly boom

All that he talks to now are his friends

Something is changing

Something he's not gonna tell me



MRS. BASKIN AND PARENTS:

I wish kids were less wearing

I wish they'd change their jeans

I wish I wasn't staring

At seven years of teens

Can't wait until it's over



Josh!

Billy!



Soon as his chores and homework are done

Carnival's on, please don't make me shout

Never forget before you have fun

You have to take the garbage out

Hey, Billy, take the garbage out

You have to take the garbage out!



BILLY:

Why don't you do it?



FATHER:

What did you say?



BILLY:

I said I'll be right down!



PARENTS:

I wish the teens were over

I wish they'd never start

Wish kids could get to grown-up

Without the growing part

Can't wait till I stop wishing



KIDS:

Why can't I just do things on my own?



PARENTS:

Can't wait until they're older!



KIDS:

Why can't my parents leave me alone?



PARENTS:

Can't wait until they're neater!

Can't wait until they're older!

Can't wait until they're neater!

Thirteen will soon be over!

Can't WAIT!
