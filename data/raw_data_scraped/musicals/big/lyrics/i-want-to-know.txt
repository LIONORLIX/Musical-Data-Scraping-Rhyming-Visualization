I Want to Know


YOUNG JOSH

Girls smell like girls, women wear perfume

That's one of their female glories

What do I do when I'm in her room?

I just think I want to know



I've heard the jokes, seen the magazines

Laughed when all my friends told stories

Talked all the talk, I don't know what it means

Now I think I want to know



I want to know how love feels

What kind of lightning strikes you?

How does a woman kiss you

When she likes you?



She's very close, I can feel her breath

Tickling just above my collar

What happens next scares me half to death

Now's my chance to learn

Where these feelings come

All that's what I want to know



She's very close, now she's closer still

I can feel our bodies touching

I cannot move but somehow I will

Now her mouth is close

Close enough to kiss

This is what I want to know
