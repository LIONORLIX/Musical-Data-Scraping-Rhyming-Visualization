Time of Your Life/Fun


KIDS:

Come in, come in for the time of your life!

We promise you the time of your life.

'Cause every day is the time of your life.

When it's time to play!



Come in, come in for the time of your life!

We promise you the time of your life.

'Cause every day is the time of your life.

When it's time for fun!



JOSH:

Fun!

You know the trick when you're small.

Fun!

A paper airplane, a ball.

Fun! You simply have it, that's all.

Fun is doing a puzzle

Staying up till it's done.

What I wouldn't give to be

A kid again and have fun!



MACMILLAN:

Fun!

It's what a kid seems to know.

Fun!

It's when you go with the flow.

Fun!

It's what I had long ago.

Fun is going out fishing,

When you hunt with a gun.

What I wouldn't give to be

A kid again and have fun!



JOSH:

A kid can take a paper clip,

A plastic tube,

A pencil tip,

And all at once it's a rocket ship

That's the way they play!



MACMILLAN:

A grown-up sits there on his butt

He's (???) open and the window shut

Sickening feeling in his gut

Life has slipped away



MACMILLAN, JOSH AND COMPANY:

Fun!

You want jump when you're cold.

Fun!

And it's a secret I'm told.

I'm getting big but not old.

You can have it alone but

Two are better than one,

What I wouldn't give to be-

A kid until eternity-

What I wouldn't give to be

A kid again and have fun!



Fun!

It's got a rhythm, a sound,

Fun!

And when the rhythm gets found,

Fun!

You want to spread it around,

Fun was follow the leader

Starting when I was one, right!

What I wouldn't give to be

A kid again and have fun!



Fun!

It's when they start a parade.

Fun!

It's a piano you played.

Fun!

It takes me back to first grade.



JOSH:

Look! It's playing by itself!



[INTERLUDE]



COMPANY:

What I wouldn't give to be-

A kid until eternity-

You're not wrong, I want to be

A kid who's having Fun!

FUN!
