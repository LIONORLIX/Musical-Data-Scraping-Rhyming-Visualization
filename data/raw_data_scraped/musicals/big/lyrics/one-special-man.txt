One Special Man


SUSAN:

It?s awesome, amazing

It?s hard to believe

The secret the cosmos had tucked up its sleeve

As I was constructing my bold master plan

The piece that was missing was one special man



I?d locked up my senses

You hurdled the fence

Dissolved my defenses

And now life makes sense

Your joshing disarmed me

that?s how it began

And now I?m so happy

With one special man



I stand here I face you I see in your eyes

The woman I?d hidden behind the disguise

You shake me, astound me

Like no one else can

You?re solid, you?re sound

You?re no flesh in the pan

I?m so glad I found you

You?re my special man
