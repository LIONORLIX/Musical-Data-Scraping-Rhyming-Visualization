Cross the Line


JOSH:

This is our dance

Gotta come dance with me

This is our chance

Gotta move instantly

Any minute now

It's gonna have flown away

If we wait around

Today will be yesterday

bEcause tonite's the night

When we cross the line

Because tonite's the nite

it's gonna happen

You can't wait on the side

there's a door open wide

And I tell you tonite's the night



JOSH AND KIDS:

You can dance too

You've gotta come try it now



JOSH:

Do what I do

Fake if you don't know how



JOSH AND KIDS:

Any thing the kids

Are doing will be a-okay

If you want to dance with me

I'll be blown away

'Cause tonite's the night

when we cross the line

this is our invitation to the party

can't stand still on the side

there's a door open wide

and i tell you  tonite's the nite

when we must cross over

who knows what we'll find



EVERYONE:

Cause tonite's the night

When we cross the line

Because tonite's the nite

it's gonna happen

You can't wait on the side

there's a door open wide

And I promise tonite's the night



(Interlude)



Everyone

Cross that line

Cross that line

Cross that line

Cross that line

Cross that line

Cross that line

Cross that line

Yea!

Cause tonite's the night

When we cross the line

Because tonite's the nite

it's gonna happen

You can't wait on the side

there's a door open wide

And I promise tonite's the night

When we must cross over

Who knows what we'll find



JOSH

That was a kiss

Golly she kissed me

Out of the blue

suddenly kissed me

What do I make of this

Where is she coming from

All I know is this

Wasn't a kiss from Mom

Is tonite the night

I cross the line?

Is tonite the nite

Something happens?

I feel wild, I feel goosed

I feel scared, I feel juiced

I feel bounced like a ball

What I don't feel is small

I feel where I belong

I feel strong most of all

I feel Tall

I feel grown

I feel big

I feel big



EVERYONE

Cross the line

Cross the line

Cross the line

Cross the line

Cross the line
