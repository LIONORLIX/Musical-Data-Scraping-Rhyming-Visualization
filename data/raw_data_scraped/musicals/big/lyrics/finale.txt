JOSH:

I made a wish

And it came true

And what I wished was just that I was someone different

And now I wish the same with you

But I'm just me

That's why I know now

I have to go now



SUSAN:

Stars

I once wished for stars

Something bold that someone might give

That would change how I live

Like stars

Then you gave me stars

Were you someone smart who just knew

Oh no, you were just you

And with stars

I got back my life

Do you even know

You saved me

When you gave me

Me

And a ring

And...



JOSH:

Stars

People wish on stars

From now on whenever I do

I'll think you're looking too



BOTH:

Up at stars

We can touch through stars

Isn't that a thought that's awesome

Sharing always

Stars, stars, stars



ZOLTAR:

Make your wish



ALL:

Your wish is granted
