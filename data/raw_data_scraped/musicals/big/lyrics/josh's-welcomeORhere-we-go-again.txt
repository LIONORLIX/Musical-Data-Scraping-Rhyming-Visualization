Josh's Welcome/Here We Go Again


SUSAN, PAUL AND EXECUTIVES:

You're gonna love working here.

Welcome to our little group!

Clever the way that he killed off our toy

And our bonus in one perfect scoop!



He thinks he's playing a game.

You wait how quickly he'll see!

He's gonna learn how I deal with a sneak,

He would be inside of a week

He isn't fighting some kid,

He's fighting me!



SUSAN:

I've seen nine months work

Going down the drain

It's been one more day

That's at best insane,

Here we go again.



After all my vows

And my lofty aims

That I'd not get caught

Playing corporate games

Here we go again.



I wish my life were simpler,

I wish these walls weren't gray,

I wish that I were standing

On a beach in Caneo Bay,

With a drink that has umbrellas

And a novel by Jane Austin

Being eyed by two young fellows

Who run marathons in Boston...



All that romantic hocus-pocus

Like a movie in soft focus...



But my life is not

Like a movie is

And its dumb to stand

Here and say gee wiz

When it's crisis time

In the kiddie biz

Here we go again...



It has just come clear

Well, it's basic psych

That the man I'm with

I don't even like!

Here we go again...



I wish I felt connected,

I wish I felt inspired,

I wish I felt no interest

In that guy who just got hired.

Can someone take me walking

Far from crowds and cars?

And in one perfect moment

Beneath a dome of stars

Change my life...



But a childish wish

Is a thing best hid,

And I love my job

And I'm not a kid.

So I'll keep on saying

As I always did

Here we go again...
