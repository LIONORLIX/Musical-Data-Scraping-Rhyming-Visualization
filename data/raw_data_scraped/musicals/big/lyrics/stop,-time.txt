Stop, Time


MRS. BASKIN:

Two months old, he looks up at you

How his smile melts your heart

You want to say, "Stop, time"

Don't move on

Even as you watch that look is gone

Then he's two, such a little man

So alive and so smart

Again you say, "Stop, time"

Stay just this way

But the future comes and he can't stay

Nobody warns you of this parent's paradox

You want your kid to change and grow

But when he does, another child you've just begun to know

Leaves forever

Birthdays fly - 7, 8, 9, 10

Every kid he becomes you clutch and say "Stop, time"

Hold this one fast

But it's not supposed to last

And that time has come and passed

For he's growing

And he has to go

If I had only stopped the clock four weeks ago

Somehow had frozen time right there

He'd still be here, I'd see his face

I'd hold him in my arms

Safe forever

It can't be that he's reached thirteen

Now the real changes start

But he's not here

"Stop, time"

Don't rush life so

Bring him back

And then I'll let him go
