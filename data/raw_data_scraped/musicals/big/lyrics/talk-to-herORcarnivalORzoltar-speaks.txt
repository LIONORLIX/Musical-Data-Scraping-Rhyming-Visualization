Talk to Her/Carnival/Zoltar Speaks


BILLY:

What'd I tell you, man? Cynthia Benson can hardly keep her hands off you.

All you have to do is make your move.

(singing) talk to her.



JOSH:

What can I say to her?



BILLY:

Talk about high school, the weather, whatever,

Talk to her!

Here's how you play to her

Say you like Seinfeld



JOSH:

And she'll think I'm cool

I'll tell her last night I woke up saying her name

Yeah, yeah!

She'll like that.

She'll hate that!

She'll think I'm a dork

Like Benjamin Rubenstein



BILLY:

Talk to her!



JOSH:

Right! I'll sound ok to her stammering 'duh' like a geek.



BILLY:

Close your eyes. Move 'er close.

Swallow hard and speak!

Move! Move! Move! Move! Yeah!

Move it! Move it! Ah!

CYNTHIA:

I'd be afraid going in a ride like this alone.

You would?

How can you stand there and squeak?

Here's you chance. Grab it now!

Reach your teeth and...



JOSH:

Well, if you'd like some company, Cynthia, I could...

This is Derek. He drives!



JOSH:

Why does disaster follow me?



BILLY:

You are a total curse.



JOSH:

I wish the earth would swallow me.



BILLY:

Hey, you blew it. It's not the end of the world.



JOSH:

Sorry, kid, Read this sign. You must be at least this big to ride this ride!

Kid, come on, you're holding up the line!



CYNTHIA:

See ya, Josh!
