Dancing All the Time


I was 12 and alive

Nothing stopped me from dawn till bedtime

Dancing lessons, cheerleader too

Getting A's, nothing I couldn't do

I was running all the time

I was dancing all the time

I had all the time in the world

Oh my God, I was brave

I thought nothing ahead could hurt me

Lunging forward, worst that could be

Couldn't faze indestructible me

I was laughing all the time

I was dancing all the time

I had all the time in the world

How that little girl slipped by

How that stream of dreams run dry

Somewhere in my teens

I seem to lose the means to fly

My, what I'd give

To be laughing all the time

To be dancing all the time

And have all the time in the world

And with you I'm back

Smiling all the time

And I'm dancing all the time

We have all the time in the world
