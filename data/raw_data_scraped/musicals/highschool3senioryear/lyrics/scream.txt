Scream


The day your door is closed

The echoes fill your soul

It won't say which way to go

Just trust your heart



To find what you're here for

Open another door

But I'm not sure anymore

It's just so hard



Voices in my head

Tell me they know best

Gotto keep me on the edge

They're pushin', pushin', they're pushin'



I know they've got a plan

With the balls in my hands

This time it's man to man

I'm droppin', fightin' inside of (oh, that's upside down)

I'm spinnin' faster

What do I do now?

Without you



I don't know where to go

What's the right team?

I want my own thing

So bad I'm gonna scream!



I can't choose

So confused

What's it all mean?

I want my own dream

So bad I'm gonna scream!



I'm kicking down the walls

I gotta make them fall

Just break through them all

I'm pushin', crushin', upon a freight



To find myself

Me and no one else

Which way? I can't tell

I'm searchin', searchin', can't find a (no, man, I should turn)

I should to right or left is

It's like nothing works

Without you



I don't know where to go

What's the right team?

I want my own thing

So bad I'm gonna scream!



I can't choose

So confused

What's it all mean?

I want my own dream

So bad I'm gonna scream!



Yeah

The clock's running down

Hear the crowd gettin' loud

I'm consumed by the sound

Is it her?

Is it love?

Can the music ever be enough?

Got to work it out

Got to work it out

You can do it

You can do it!



I don't know where to go

What's the right team?

I want my own thing

So bad I'm gonna scream!



I can't choose

So confused

What's it all mean?

I want my own dream

So bad I'm gonna scream!



I don't know where to go

What's the right team?

I want my own thing

I want my own thing



I can't choose

So confused

What's it all mean?

I want my own dream

So bad I'm gonna scream!



Oh!

Aahhh!
