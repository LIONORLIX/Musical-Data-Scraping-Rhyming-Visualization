We're All in This Together (Graduation Mix)


Together, together, together everyone

Together, together, come on let's have some fun!



Here and now it's time for celebration

We finally figured it out (yeah yeah)

That all our dreams have no limitations

That's what it's all about



Everyone is special in their own way

We make each other strong (make each other strong)

We're not the same

We're different in a good way

Together's where we belong



We're all in this together

Once we know

That we are

We're all stars

And we see that

We're all in this together

And it shows

When we stand

Hand in hand

Make our dreams come true.. (Make our dreams come true..)



Together, together, together everyone

Together, together, come on let's have some fun!

Together, we?re there for each other every time

Together, Together come on let's do this right!



We're all here

and speaking out with one voice (one for all)

We're going to rock the house (yeah..)

The party's on now everybody make some noise

Come on scream and shout!



We've arrived because we stuck together

Champions one and all



We're all in this together

Once we know

That we are

We're all stars

And we see that

We're all in this together

And it shows

When we stand

Hand in hand

Make our dreams come true..



We?re all in this together!

Together!



We're all in this together

Once we know

That we are

We're all stars

And we see that

We're all in this together

And it shows

When we stand

Hand in hand

Make our dreams come

We're all in this together

When we reach

We can fly

Know inside

We can make it

We're all in this together

Once we see

There's a chance

That we have

And we take it

We?re all in this together!

Ahh?. All in this together!
