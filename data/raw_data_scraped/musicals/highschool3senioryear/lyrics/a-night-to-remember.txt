A Night To Remember


Guess now it's official

Can't back out, can't back out,

No!



Gettin ready (gettin ready, oh)

For the night of nights (uh-huh)

The night of nights (all right)



Don't panic.

Panic!



Now do we have to dress up for the Prom?

Dude, I don't think we have the choice.



Yeah it's the night of all nights

Got to look just right

Dressing to impress the boys



Do I want classic or vintage or plaid?

Where's the mirror?

I think this tux is too baggy

Too tight, it makes me look weird



Should I go movie star, glamorous, sassy or sweet?

Don't know, but no one better wear the same dress as me!



It's the night of our nightmares (it's the night of our dreams)

It's too late to back out of this (hey!)

Makeovers, massages

Don't know what a corsage is

Been waiting all our lives for this



It's gonna be a night (can't wait)

To remember (aw man)

Come on now!

Big fun (all right)



It's gonna be the night (I guess)

To last forever (lucky us)



We'll never ever ever forget!



Gettin' ready (get ready)

Gettin', gettin' ready, ready (get ready)

Gettin' ready,

Gettin', gettin' ready, oh!



Hey you been in there an hour, man!

So what should I do with my hair?

Where's my shaver? (ooh I love it!)

I look like a waiter! (should I fluff it?)

It's gettin' later already should be there



Her mother opens the door

I'm shaking inside

He's here! It's time! The hour's arrived!

Don't know why her father's staring me down

Where's my purse? Lip gloss? Now I'm really freaking out!



Then something changes my world

The most beautiful girl right in front of my eyes



It's gonna be a night (oh yeah)

To remember (that's for sure!)

Come on now!

Big fun (all right!)



It's gonna be the night (yeah tonight)

To last forever (forevermore)

We'll never ever forget!



Who's that girl?

She's so fine

Who's that guy?

I don't recognize, no

Who's that girl?

She looks so good, yeah

Guess you never really noticed but you probably should!

Big fun!



On the night of nights, (all right)

The night of nights, tonight

Let's dance!

On the night of nights, you know we're gonna do it right



It's gonna be a night

To remember

It's gonna be the night

To last forever



It's gonna be our night (yeah)

To remember

It's gonna be the night

To last forever (forever)



It's gonna be our night (you know it)

To remember (for all time)

Come on now

Big fun (to remember)



It's gonna be the night (to love it)

To last forever (the rest of our lives)

We'll never ever ever forget!



It's gonna be our night (oh yeah)

All together (say it loud!)

Come on now, everyone (that's right)



It's gonna be a night (yeah tonight)

To remember (hear the crowd)



And never ever ever never ever ever never ever never ever ever forget!
