Spring Musical Medley


It's our last chance to share the stage

Before we go our separate ways

High school wasn't meant to last forever

It's our last chance for us to shine

To bring you music one more time

So come on, come on, come on (come on, come on, come on)

Come on, come on, come on,



W-I-L-D Wildcats!

You know! Come on!

W-I-L-D Wildcats!

Come on, come on!



East High Boys, let's make some noise! (oh yeah)

W-I-L-D Wildcats!

Now's the time!



(Wildcats!) This is the last time to get it right (Go Wildcats!)

This is the last chance to make it our night (Wildcats!)

We gotta show what we're all about (Go Wildcats!)

Work together!

This is our last chance to make our mark

History will know who we are

This is the last chance to make it count

It's now or never, yeah



I want it (all!) I want it, want it, want it

The fame and the fortune and more

I want it all! I want it, want it, want it

I gotta have my star on the door!



I want the world, nothing less

All the glam, and the press

Only giving me the best reviews



I want it all, I want it all,

I want it all, I want it all

I want it all



Kick it girls!



I want it all, I want it all,

I want it all, I want it all

I want it all



We want it (we want it) all!

Rugband! Thank you, East High! You're amazing! Good night!



ooh, yeah, yeah

ohh, yeah



I got a lot of things

I have to do

All these distractions

Our future's coming soon



We're being pulled

A hundred different directions

But whatever happens

I know I've got you



You're on my mind, you're in my heart

It doesn't matter where we are

We'll be all right

Even if we're miles apart

Even if we're miles apart

Even if we're miles and miles and miles apart



All I wanna do

Is be with you, be with you

There's nothing we can't do (ew)

Just wanna be with you, only you



No matter where life takes us

Nothing can take us apart (achoo!)

I just wanna be with (ew) you



You know how life can be

It changes overnight

It's sunny then raining

But it's all right



A friend like you

Always makes it easy

I know that you get me

Every time



Through every up through every down

You know I'll always be around

Through anything you can count on me



All I wanna do

Is be with you, be with you

There's nothing we can't do

Just wanna be with you, only you



No matter where life takes us

Nothing can break us apart (you know it's true)

I just wanna be with you, you

I just wanna be with you



The sun will always shine

That's how you make me feel

We're gonna be all right

Cause what we have is real

We will always be together



All I wanna do

Is be with you, be with you

There's nothing we can't do

Just wanna be with you, only you



No matter where life takes us

Nothing can break us apart (you know it's true)

I just wanna be with you (all I wanna do)

All that I wanna do

Just be with you



All that I wanna do (oh, all I wanna do)

Is be with you

All that I wanna do (hey, yeah)

Is be with you

All that I wanna do

I just wanna be with you



Who's that girl?

She's so fine

Who's that girl?

I don't recognize

Who's that girl?

She looks so good, yeah

Guess you never really noticed but you probably should

Big fun!



On the night of nights, the night of nights, tonight

Let's dance!

On the night of nights, you know we're gonna do it right



It's gonna be our night (you know it)

To remember (for all time)

So guys?

Big fun



It's gonna be the night (to love it)

To last forever (the rest of our lives)

We'll never ever ever forget



It's gonna be my night (oh yeah)

All together (say it loud)

Come on now

Everyone

That's right



It's gonna be a night (you can bet)

To remember (hear the crowd)



And never ever ever never ever ever never ever never ever ever forget!
