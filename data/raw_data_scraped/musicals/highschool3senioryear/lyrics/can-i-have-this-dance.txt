Can I Have This Dance


Take my hand

Take a breath

Pull me close

And take one step

Keep your eyes

Locked on mine

And let the music be your guide.



Won't you promise me (Now won't you promise me)

That you'll never forget (We'll keep dancing)

To keep dancing

Wherever we go next



It's like catching lightning

The chances of finding someone

Like you

It's one in a million

The chances of feeling the way

We do



And with every step together

We just keep on getting better



So can I have this dance? (Can I have this dance?)

Can I have this dance?



Take my hand

I'll take the lead

And every turn

Will be safe with me



To be afraid

Afraid to fall

You know I'll catch you

Through it all



And you can't keep (even a thousand miles)

Us apart (can keep us apart)

Cause my heart (cause my heart)

Is wherever you are



It's like catching lightning

The chances of finding someone

Like you

It's one in a million

The chances of feeling the way

We do



And with every step together

We just keep on getting better



So can I have this dance? (Can I have this dance)

Can I have this dance?



Oh,

No mountain's too high enough

Oceans too wide

Cause together or not

Our dance won't stop



Let it rain, let it pour

What we have is worth fighting for

You know I believe

That we were meant to be,

Yeah,



It's like catching lightning

The chances of finding someone

Like you (Like you)

It's one in a million

The chances of feeling the way

We (we do) do



And with every step together

We just keep on getting better



So can I have this dance? (Can I have this dance?)

Can I have this dance?



Can I have this dance?

Can I have this dance?
