Last Chance


All:

Because it's our last chance

to share the stage

Before we go our separate ways

We should spend these final days together



It's our last chance for us to shine

and make some music one more time



So come on,

come on, come on

come on, come on, come on,

come on, come on, come on

come on, come on, come on

Let's dance!

Let's dance!



Because this is our last chance

it's our last chance!
