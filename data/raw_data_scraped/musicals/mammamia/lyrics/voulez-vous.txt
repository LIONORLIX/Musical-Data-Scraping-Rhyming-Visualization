Voulez-Vous


COMPANY:

People everywhere

A sense of expectation

Hangin' in the air

Givin' out a spark

Across the room your eyes

Are glowin' in the dark

And here we go again

We know the start

We know the end

Masters of the scene

We've done it long before

And now we're back

To get some more

You know what I mean



Voulez-vous

Take it now or leave it

Now is all we get

Nothing promised

No regrets

Voulez-vous

Ain't no big decision

You know what to do

La question

C'est voulez-vous
