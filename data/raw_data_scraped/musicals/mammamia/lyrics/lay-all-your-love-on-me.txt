Lay All Your Love on Me


SKY

I wasn't jealous before we met

Now every man that I see is a potential threat

And I'm possessive, it isn't nice

You've heard me saying that smoking was my only vice

But now it isn't true

Now everything is new

And all I've learned

Has overturned

I beg of you



SOPHIE

Don't go wasting your emotion

Lay all your love on me



It was like shooting a sitting duck

A little small talk, a smile and baby I was stuck

I still don't know what you've done with me

A grown-up woman should never fall so easily

I feel a kind of fear

When I don't have you near

Unsatisfied

I skip my pride

I beg you dear



SKY

Don't go wasting your emotion

Lay all your love on me



BOYS

Don't go sharing your devotion

Lay all your love on me



SOPHIE

I've had a few little love affairs

They didn't last very long and they've been pretty scarce



SKY

I used to think that was sensible

It makes the truth even more incomprehensible



SOPHIE

'Cause everything is new

And everything is you

And all I've learned

Has overturned

What can I do?



SKY / PEPPER / EDDIE / BOYS

Don't go wasting your emotion

Lay all your love on me

Don't go sharing your devotion

Lay all your love on me



GIRLS

Don't go wasting your emotion

Lay all your love on me

Don't go sharing your devotion

Lay all your love on me
