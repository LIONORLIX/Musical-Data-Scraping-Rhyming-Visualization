Money, Money, Money


DONNA

I work all night, I work all day

To pay the bills I have to pay



COMPANY

Ain't it sad?



DONNA

And still there never seems to be

A single penny left for me



COMPANY

That's too bad



DONNA

In my dreams I have a plan

If I got me a wealthy man

I wouldn't have to work at all

I'd fool around and have a ball



COMPANY

Money, money, money

Must be funny

In a rich man's world

Money, money, money

Always sunny

In a rich man's world

All the things I could do

If I had a little money

It's a rich man's world

It's a rich man's world



TANYA

A man like that is hard to find



DONNA

But I can't get him off my mind



ALL

Ain't it sad?



ROSIE

And if he happens to be free

I bet he wouldn't fancy me



ALL

That's too bad



PEPPER

So I must leave, I'll have to go

To Las Vegas or Monaco

And win a fortune in a game

My life would never be the same



COMPANY

Money, money, money

Must be funny

In a rich man's world

Money, money, money

Always sunny

In a rich man's world



DONNA

All the things I could do



COMPANY

If I had a little money

It's a rich man's world



Money, money, money

Must be funny

In a rich man's world

Money, money, money

Always sunny

In a rich man's world



DONNA

All the things I could do



COMPANY

If I had a little money

It's a rich man's world

It's a rich man's world
