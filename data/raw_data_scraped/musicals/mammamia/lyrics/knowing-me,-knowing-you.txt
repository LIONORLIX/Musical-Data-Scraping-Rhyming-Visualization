Knowing Me, Knowing You


SAM:

No more carefree laughter

Silence ever after

Walking through an empty house

Tears in my eyes

This is how the story ends

This is goodbye



Knowing me, knowing you

There is nothing we can do

Knowing me, knowing you

We just have to face it

This time we're through

Breaking up is never easy, I know

But I have to go

Knowing me, knowing you

It's the best I can do



Memories, good days, bad days

They'll be with me always

In those old familiar rooms

Children would play

Now there's only emptiness

Nothing to say



Knowing me, knowing you

There is nothing we can do

Knowing me, knowing you

We just have to face it

This time we're through

Breaking up is never easy, I know

But I have to go

Knowing me, knowing you

It's the best I can do

Knowing me, knowing you

It's the best I can do
