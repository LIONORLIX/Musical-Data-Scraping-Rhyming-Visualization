Under Attack


SOPHIE:

Don't know how to take it

Don't know where to go

My resistance running low

And every day the hold is getting tighter

And it troubles me so



NIGHTMARE CHORUS:

You know that I'm nobody's fool



SOPHIE

I'm nobody's fool and

Yet it's clear to me

I don't have a strategy

It's just like taking candy from a baby

And I think I must be



SOPHIE & NIGHTMARE CHORUS:

Under attack

I'm being taken

About to crack

Defences breaking

Won't somebody please have a heart?

Come and rescue me now

'Cause I'm falling apart



Under attack

I'm taking cover

They're on my track, three Dads,

one lover

Thinking nothing can stop them now

Should I want to

I'm not sure I would know how



SOPHIE:

This is getting crazy

I should tell them so

Really let my anger show

I feel like I was trapped within a

nightmare

I've got nowhere to go.



NIGHTMARE CHORUS:

Still undecided I suppose



SOPHIE:

Yes, it's what I wanted

But I'm scared as well

Staring down the deepest well

I hardly dare to think of what would happen

Where I'd be if I fell



SOPHIE & NIGHTMARE CHORUS:

Under attack

I'm being taken

About to crack

Defences breaking

Won't somebody please have a heart?

Come and rescue me now

'Cause I'm falling apart



Under attack

I'm taking cover

They're on my track, there dads,

one lover

Thinking nothing can stop them now

Should I want to

I'm not sure I would know how



NIGHTMARE CHORUS:

You kinow that I'm nobody's fool



SOPHIE & NIGHTMARE CHORUS:

Under attack

I'm being taken

About to crack

Defences breaking

Won't somebody please have a heart?

Come and rescue me now

'Cause I'm falling apart



Under attack

I'm taking cover

They're on my track, there dads,

one lover



SOPHIE:

Thinking nothing can stop them now

Should I want to

I'm not sure I would know how
