A Sword And A Rose And A Cape


Marco:



In me you see a relic of a long lamented age

When masculine behavior wrote a grand romantic page

With every man a lover like a hero on a stage

With a sword and a rose and a cape



Where are the great romantics who would languish for a rose

Who fought a duel with one hand while the other hand wrote prose

Who scale my lady’s balcony and swung upon her drape

With a sword and a rose and a cape



They have flown, have flown like ashes

Or they reappear in flashes



Chorus:



But they find themselves contrary to the point



Marco:



These aristocrats and highbrows

Meet with such astonished eyebrows



Chorus:



They endeavor proudly wither and for rot



Marco:



Where are the flaming Frenchmen and the seething Viennese

In Spain today they’ll hug a horse and let a mistress freeze

And now the male Italian just gets passionate for cheese

Oh, the sword and the rose and the cape



And so if when I look at you I flutter like a moth

It’s just that I am of the breed and woven from the cloth

Of men who live to fight a duel or plight a lover’s troth

A man who would twine her hair or peel my lady’s grape

Leap from her balcony and glorious escape



Chorus:



Play on her harpsichord and perpetrate her rape



Marco:



Perpetrate her rape?



Chorus:



With a sword and a rose and a cape

Ol!
