Yes, My Heart


Lili:



I am dizzy, I am whirling

I feel like my hair is curling

All around my head

Like a lucky bird

Landed on my head

I must pinch myself to see

If this has happened and to me

It’s like a lucky bird

Landed on my head



Ordinarily I’m meek

But I could raise a fuss and shriek

See that cloud

I just might

Jump right up

Take a bite

But for a while I will

Stand completely still

My heart’s trying to tell me something

Yes, my heart, begin

Speak or pound or spin

Tell me something

Tell me something

Yes, my heart

It’s wonderful

Yes, my heart

This is our chance

For awhile I will

Stand completely still

Then I’ll have to laugh and sing and dance



I get off the bus

Brand new town, brand new place

Suddenly good luck kisses me on the face

Like someone took my shoulders and pointed me this way

A place to work

Oh what a place to work

Near a great magician

A magician who makes flowers out of air



See that star

I just might

Fly up there and shine as bright

But for awhile I will

Stand completely still

My heart’s trying to tell me something

Yes, my heart begin

Speak or pound or spin

Tell me something

Tell me something

Yes, my heart

It’s wonderful

Yes, my heart

This is our chance

Ordinarily I’m meek

But I could raise a fuss and shriek

See that cloud

I just might

Jump right up

Take a bite

For awhile I will

Stand completely still

Then I’ll have to laugh and sing and dance
