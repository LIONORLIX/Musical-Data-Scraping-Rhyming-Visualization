The Rich


Lili and the Puppets:



The rich put cream on their berries

The rich drive shiny black cars



Puppets:



The rich go here

The rich go there



Lili:



It’s close to the truth



Puppets:



But far from fair



Lili:



The rich stay cozy all winter



Puppets:



Stay cold the month of July



Lili and the Puppets:



But for all of the world

We wouldn’t switch

We’re glad we’re rich



Carrot Top:



Gee, Lili, I didn’t know you could sing like that. You just hit a high C.



Lili:



I’m sorry, Carrot Top, I won’t do it again.



Marguerite:



That is a compliment, dear, very few girls are able to reach a C. I of course, have been known to reach high M about L. I’ll never forget, when I was playing Carmen in Aida…



Lili and the Puppets:



The rich put cream on their berries

The rich drive shiny black cars

The rich go here

The rich go there

It’s close to the truth



Marguerite:



Or was it Aida in Carmen?



Lili and the Puppets:



The rich stay cozy all winter

Stay cold the month of July

But for all of the world

We wouldn’t switch



Marguerite:



Of course, my best role was Barbara of Seville…



Lili and Puppets:



We’re glad we’re rich
