Always, Always You


Marco:



It was always, always you

Always, always you

Though my eyes may wander

To and fro and yonder

Still my heart’s affection

Always beats in one direction



Rosalie:



Every beat	 Every beat, when we meet

For you, my sweet	 I repeat my heart is at your feet, my sweet

All the love my beating heart can brew	If you can be true I’ll be living for you

It shocks me so	 You’re my Marco, I’m your Rose

You didn’t know	 Life is magic goodness knows



Both:



That it was always you

Always, always, always, always, always you
