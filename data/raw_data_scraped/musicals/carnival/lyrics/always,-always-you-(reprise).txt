Always, Always You (Reprise)


Rosalie:



It was always, always you

Always, always you

You would cheat your mother

In your heart a thief, dear

Still I want no other

Doctor, lawyer, Indian chief, dear



Life is strange

A man can change

Though years could find me basking in the sun

But all the same, Iâ€™ll dress for rain

Always, always, always, always, always you
