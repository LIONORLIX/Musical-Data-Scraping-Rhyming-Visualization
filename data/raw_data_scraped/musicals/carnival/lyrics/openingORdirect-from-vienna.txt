Opening/Direct From Vienna


Schlegel:



Sing, Rosalie! Raise that golden voice in song! Let them know that Schlegel’s Grand Imperial Cirque de Paris has come to town!



Rosalie and Chorus:



Direct from Vienna for seven days only

At popular prices these wonders of wonders

Whose dazzle and daring and fabulous feats have

Astounded the capitals of Europe

And confounded the orient as well



Schlegel:



And now sing for them, my children, sing for humanity, sing or I’ll dock you two weeks pay.



Chorus:



We’ll quicken your pulse with a thousand delights of

Fantasional mystic Arabian nights

Your eyes will go round at the sights that astounded

And dazzled the capitals of Europe

And confounded the orient as well



From out of the East

You’ll watch a jewel

Who fled a harem in Istanbul



And from the ballet here’s Rover

Who studied for years with the great Pavlova



Direct from Vienna for seven days only

At popular prices these wonders of wonders

Whose dazzle and daring and fabulous feats have

Astounded the capitals of Europe

And confounded the orient as well



Come on, mortgage your house

Or sell your cow

Munich. Liepzig, Cologne

Berlin and now

‘



Direct from Vienna for seven days only

At popular prices these wonders of wonders

Whose dazzle and daring and fabulous feats have

Astounded the capitals of Europe



A thousand sensations

No ifs ands or buts

Without expugations not one single cut

For you to inspect we are coming direct from Vienna
