I Hate Him


Lili:



I hate him

I hate him

I’ve never hated anyone but I hate him

He’s some kind of monster

A monster, a devil

He shouts at me, he yells at me

Then from nowhere comes a kiss



He’s hateful

He’s hateful

It’s not my fault if I just can’t be grateful

To a man who

Never says a kind word

Never does a nice thing

Never says how are you

Only stands there being hateful

So I hate him

Yes, I hate him



Jacquot’s a nice man

Jacquot’s such a nice man

A man who smiles, a man who talks

And says a decent word

This could be a very pleasant place around here

With Jacquot

And Marguerite

And though Renardo steals

He’s very sweet

And Carrot Top

But not him
