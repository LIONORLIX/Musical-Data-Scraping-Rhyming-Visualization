Finale


(Love Makes the World Go ‘Round plays in the background throughout, finally swelling to a climax at the end)



Carrot Top:



Lili? Are you going without even saying goodbye? If you’re leaving, Lili, please take me with you. You’re my sweetheart, you see. I’ve always loved you, from the first moment I saw you, wearing that terrible hat and carrying that lopsided suitcase. Please don’t leave us, Lili. We need you.
