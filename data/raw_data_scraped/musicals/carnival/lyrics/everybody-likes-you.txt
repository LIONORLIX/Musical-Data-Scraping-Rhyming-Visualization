Everybody Likes You


Paul:



Who can I be

Now that I can’t be me anymore

Shall I be the sunny smiling fellow

Who won’t rock the boat

Cause he might splash the ocean

But sit there and cheerfully twitter

Cause someone might say

See that man over there

He’s bitter



When will I learn to be like you

Everybody likes you

Everybody likes you

You’re a lucky fellow

You’re a lucky fellow

The secret is your smile

I ought to have a smile

That smile takes quite a knack

I think I need a smile

And who cares if it’s real

Or painted with shellac

A smile full of theatrics

For easily agreeing

Two eyes with acrobatics

To see the way they’re seeing

Let’s turn about

You say the words for me



Cause everybody likes you

Everybody likes you

And no one

No one likes me

No one

No one likes me
