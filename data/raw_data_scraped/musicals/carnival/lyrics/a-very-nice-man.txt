A Very Nice Man


Lili:



Did you ever in your life see such a lot of wonderful things

Every shelf is stacked so jam-packed

That you have to hang the rest on strings

What a very nice saucer

What a very nice vase

Here’s a cover would surely cure a

Shabby bureau

This is sure a very nice place



You’re a very nice person

With a very good heart

And with one of those honest, kindly faces

It’s a very good feeling

To belong in a place

Working hard as you can

For a very nice man

With a very nice face



It’d seemed the end of the world

To meet with such a bitter disappointment

And not a friend in the world

But in the nick of time

An angel out of the blue

Said let me give it a thought

I might have a job for you- ooh



What very nice doilies

Made of very fine lace

How in heaven was this one slipped in

Stitched up, snipped in

Still it’s ripped in a very nice place



What a very nice picture

In a very nice frame

They’re so real you can almost smell those roses

It’s a very good feeling

To belong in a place

To be young and strong

And have ambition

I could rise to a high position

It’s a very nice place

You’re a very nice man

With a very nice face
