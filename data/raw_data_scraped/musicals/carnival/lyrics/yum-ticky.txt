Yum Ticky


Marguerite:



In my ruby mantilla and my black castanets

I yum ticky ticky tum tum

I yum ticky ticky tum



Renardo:



When I peek I can see ya

Through my black ringolets



Marguerite:



Yum ticky ticky tum tum

Yum ticky ticky tum



Lili:



I keep millions of Spaniards on fire

They admire



Puppets:



Her yum ticky ticky tum tum



Lili and Puppets:



We avoid tarantellas

And we spurn minuets

Cause they don?t ticky ticky tum tum

They don?t ticky ticky tum

They don?t ticky ticky tum tum tum



Lili:



(singing a high note)

Ah!



Marguerite:



(matching her pitch)

La!



Lili:



(singing higher)



Ah!



Marguerite:



(matching her pitch)

La!



Lili:



(sings a high pitched string of notes)



Marguerite:



Ungrateful child! Ah- haaa!
