Mira


Lili:



I came on two buses and a train

Can you imagine that

Can you imagine that

Two buses and a train



Would you believe

Would you believe

That this is the first I’ve traveled

I come from a town

The kind of town

Where you live in a house

Til the house falls down

But if it stands up

You stay there

It’s funny but that’s their way there



I come from the town of Mira

Beyond the bridges of St. Claire

I guess you’ve never heard of Mira

It’s very small but still it’s there

They have the very greenest trees

And skies as bright as flame

But what I liked the best in Mira

Is everybody knew my name

Can you imagine that

Can you imagine that

Everybody knew my name



A room that’s strange is never cozy

A place that’s strange is never sweet

I want to have a chair that knows me

And walk a street that knows my feet

I’m very far from Mira now

And there’s no turning back

I have to find a place

I’ve got to find a place

Where everything can be the same

A street that I can know

And places I can go

Where everybody knows my name

Can you imagine that

Can you imagine that

Everybody knew my name
