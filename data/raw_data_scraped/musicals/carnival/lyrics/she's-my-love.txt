She's My Love


Paul:



She is soft, she is fair

She’s my love

She is song, she is prayer

She’s my love

Though I reach, though I try

She is braver than I

And is far less of earth than she is of sky



She is moon to my night

She’s my love

She is sight, sound, and light

She’s my love

Still the one heart I own

Hungers lost and alone

For my love’s never known

She’s my love



Still the one heart I own

Hungers lost and alone

For my love’s never known

She’s my love
