Beautiful Candy


Lili:



Break away

Kick your heels up and spend a day

Buy a new feather, a fig, or a bead

Buy yourself something you really don?t need

Something sweet like

Beautiful candy

Too pretty to eat



Puppets:



Too too pretty to

Too too pretty to



Lili:



Treat yourself

To some dreams from the upper shelf

Buy something someone took years to produce

Something you?re sure is of no Earthly use

Something sweet like:



Lili and Puppets:



Beauitful candy

Too pretty to eat



Puppets:



Too too pretty to

Too too pretty to



Lili:



Stop living for reason



Lili and Puppets:



Time to start living for rhyme

I?m on a spree and I?m

Going to make sure it?s a perfectly good waste of time



Lili:



The sun today

Will be scrambled for my soufflé

I don?t know whether to float or to fly

First I?ll find something I don?t need to buy

Something sweet like



Puppets:



A hat with a bell

A blue parakeet

Whistles to blow as I dance down the street



Lili and Puppets:



Beautiful candy

Too pretty to eat



Lili, Puppets, and Chorus:



Stop living for reason

Time to start living for rhyme

I?m on a spree and I?m

Going to make sure it?s a perfectly good waste of time



The sun today

Will be scrambled for my soufflé

I don?t know whether to float or to fly

First I?ll find something I don?t need to buy

Something sweet like



Puppets:



A hat with a bell

A blue parakeet

Whistles to blow as I dance down the street



Lili, Puppets, and Chorus:



Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful candy

Too pretty to eat
