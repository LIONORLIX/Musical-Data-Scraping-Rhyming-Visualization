Love Makes The World Go 'Round


Lili:



Love makes the world go ‘round

Love makes the world go ‘round

Somebody soon will love you

If no one loves you now



High in some silent sky

Love sings a silver song

Making the earth

Whirl softly

Love makes the world go ‘round



High in some silent sky

Love sings a silver song

Making the earth

Whirl softly

Love makes the world go ‘round
