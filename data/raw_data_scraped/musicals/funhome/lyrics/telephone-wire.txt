Telephone Wire


ALISON:

Telephone wire,

Run and run,

Telephone wire.

Sundown on the creek,

Partly frozen, partly flowing.

Must be windy, trees are bending.

Junction 50 field needs mowing.

Feels like the car is glowing.



Say something!

Talk to him!

Say something!

Anything!

At the light, at the light, at the light, at the light,

At the light, at the light, at the light, at the light.



Like, you could say,

"So, how does it feel to know

That you and I are both–"



[spoken]



BRUCE:

Hey.



ALISON:

Yeah?



BRUCE:

Where do you want to go?



ALISON:

Oh, I don't know.



[sung]



BRUCE:

I know a bar that's kind of hidden away.

A seedy club for folks like… you know.

Could be fun.



ALISON:

But Dad, I'm not twenty-one.



[spoken]



BRUCE:

Yeah, right.



[sung]



ALISON:

Telephone wire,

Long black line,

Telephone wire.

Finely threaded sky.

There's the pond where I went wading.

There's a sign for Sugar Valley.

On the mountain, light is fading.

I go back to school tomorrow!



Say something!

Talk to him!

Say something!

Anything!

At the light, at the light, at the light, at the light,

At the light, at the light, at the light, at the light.



Doesn't matter what you say,

Just make the fear in his eyes go away.



BRUCE:

There was a boy

In college,

My first year there.

Norris Jones.

He had black, wavy hair.

Norris Jones.

Where is he now?



Fourteen years old

In Swenson's barn.

It was cold.

Lots of boys messed around, you know.

For them, it was a game they outgrew,

But I always knew



ALISON:

Dad, me too!

Since, like, five, I guess,

I preferred to wear boys' shirts and pants.

I felt absurd in a dress.

I really tried to deny my feelings for girls,

But I was like you, Dad,

Me too.



BRUCE:

Norris Jones…



ALISON:

Dad?



BRUCE:

Norris Jones…



ALISON:

Dad?



[spoken]



BRUCE:

Hey, did I mention that new project I've taken on?

You've seen it, Al, that old house out on Route 150?

It's been standing empty forty, fifty years at least.



[sung]



ALISON:

Telephone wire,

Stop! Too fast!

Telephone wire,

Make this not the past.

This car ride,

This is where it has to happen!

There must be some other chances.

There's a moment I'm forgetting

Where you tell me you see me.



Say something!

Talk to me!

Say something!

Anything!

At the light,

At the light.



This can't be our last—



[spoken]



BRUCE:

Well, that was fun. It's earlier than I thought. Are you coming in?



[sung]



ALISON:

Telephone wire,

That was our last night.
