Raincoat of Love


Today I woke up with a feeling that I did not recognize

(strange feeling, yeah)

Oh, our happy life seemed far away and everything was made of lies

(lies, yeah)

The sky was turning dark when baby I looked in your eyes

And that's when I knew

Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh



Everything's alright, babe, when we're together

(when we're together)

'Cause you are like a raincoat made out of love

(keeping me dry)

Magic shield of love protecting me from bad weather

(rain from the sky)

You are like a raincoat made out of love

A raincoat of love love love love love



Everything's alright, babe, when we're together

(when we're together)

'Cause you are like a raincoat made out of love

(keeping me dry)

Magic shield of love protecting me from bad weather

(rain from the sky)

You are like a raincoat made out of love

A raincoat of love

(love love love love love)

A raincoat of love

(love love love love love)



Everything's alright babe when we're together

Everything's alright babe when we're together

Everything's alright babe when we're together

Everything's alright

Everything's alright

Everything's alright
