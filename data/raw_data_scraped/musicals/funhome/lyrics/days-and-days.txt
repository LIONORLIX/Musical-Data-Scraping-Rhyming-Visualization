Days and Days


HELEN:

Welcome to our house on Maple Avenue.

See how we polish and we shine.

We rearrange and realign.

Everything is balanced and… and…



Days and days and days—

That's how it happens:

Days and days and days

Made of lunches

And car rides

And shirts and socks

And grades

And piano

And no one clocks the day you disappear.



Days and days and days—

That's how it happens:

Days and days and days

Made of posing

And bragging

And fits of rage

And boys – my god, some of them underage!

And, oh, how did it all happen here?



There was a time your father swept me off my feet with words.

We read books,

Strolled through Munich at night,

Drank beer with friends,

Discussed the places we would go.

And he said I understood how the world made him ache.

But no, but no.



That's how it happens:

Days

Made of bargains I made because I thought

As a wife I was meant to,

And now my life is shattered and made bare.

Days and days and days and days

And days and days and days.



Welcome to our house on Maple Avenue.

See how we polish and we shine.

We rearrange and realign.

Everything is balanced and serene.

Like chaos never happens if it's never seen.



Don't you come back here.

I didn't raise you

To give away your days

Like me.
