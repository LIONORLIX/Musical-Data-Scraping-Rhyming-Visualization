It All Comes Back (Opening)


SMALL ALISON:

Daddy!

Hey, Daddy, come here, okay? I need you.

What are you doing? I said come here.

You need to do what I tell you to do.

Listen to me.

Daddy!

Come here! Hey, right here! Right now!

You’re making mad.

Listen to me.

Listen to me.

Listen to me....



I wanna play airplane.

I wanna play airplane.

I wanna play airplane!

I wanna put my arms out and fly...

Like the Red Baron in the Sopwith Camel!

No, wait—

Like Superman!

Up in the sky

Till I can see all of Pennsylvania...



BRUCE:

[spoken] Hey! Gimme a hand.



SMALL ALISON:

What’d you get, Daddy?



ALISON:

Right, right right.



BRUCE:

It’s from Clyde Gibbon’s barn. What a haul!

He said, “Take what you want.”

I said, “Clyde, are you sure?”

He said, “It’s all junk to me.”

I said, “Okay, Clyde, okay!”

C’mon. Take a look.

You go to auctions, yard sales, comb the dump.

There’s crap, there’s crap, there’s— hey.

What’s this?



SMALL ALISON:

More crap?



BRUCE:

No.

[sung] Linen!

This is linen!

Gorgeous Irish linen!

See how I can tell?

Right here, this floating thread, you see

That’s what makes it damask.

And the weight, the weight, this drape!

And the pattern, crisp and clear!

See how it’s made from

Matte and shine?

It’s tattered here, but all the rest—

How beautiful!

How fine!



[spoken]

Okay, okay. What else?

Crap... crap... dead mouse...



SMALL ALISON:

Ooh, can I have it?



BRUCE:

It’s all yours.

What’s this?

[sung]

Silver?

Is this silver?

Is this junk, or silver?

With polish, we can tell.

I love how tarnish melts away,

Opening to luster.

And the mark, is there a mark?

Yes, this stamp, you see? Right here!

That’s how the craftsman leaves a sign

That he was here and made his work

So beautiful,

So fine...



This has traveled continents to get here,

And crossed an ocean of time,

And somehow landed in this box

Under a layer of grime.

I can’t abide romantic notions

Of some vague long ago.

I want to know what’s true,

Dig deep into who

And what

And why

And when

Until now gives way to then.



ALISON:

[spoken] Did you ever imagine I’d hang on to your stuff, Dad?

Me either.

But I guess I always knew that someday I was going to draw you...

In cartoons.

Yes, Dad, I know. You think cartoons are silly.

But I draw cartoons, and I need real things to draw from,

‘cause I don’t trust memory.



[sung] But, god, this thing is ghastly!

You were so ecstatic when you found it

At a yard sale.

No, no, wait—

In Mr. Gibbon’s barn.

It all comes back,

It all comes back,

It all comes back!

There’s you.

And there’s me.

But now I’m the one who’s forty-three

And stuck.

I can’t find my way through.

Just like you.

Am I just like you?



BRUCE [counterpoint]:

A sign that he was here

And made his work.



ALISON [counterpoint]:

I can’t abide romantic notions

Of some vague long ago.



BRUCE AND ALISON:

I want to know what’s true,

Dig deep into who

And what

And why

And when

Until now gives way to then.



SMALL ALISON:

Daddy!

Hey Daddy, come here, okay?

I need you.



BRUCE:

This has traveled to get here.

So beautiful.



SMALL ALISON:

What are you doing? I said come here.



ALISON:

Flying through,

Oh—



ALISON:

I wanna play airplane.



SMALL ALISON:

I wanna play airplane.



ALISON:

I wanna play airplane.



SMALL ALISON:

I wanna play airplane!



ALISON:

[spoken] Caption—

My dad and I were exactly alike.



SMALL ALISON:

I see everything!



ALISON:

Caption—

My dad and I were nothing alike.



SMALL ALISON:

I’m Superman.



ALISON:

My dad and—

My dad and I—



SMALL ALISON:

But, Daddy, come back!
