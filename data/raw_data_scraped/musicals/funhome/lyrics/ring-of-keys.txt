Ring of Keys


ALISON [Spoken] :

You didn't notice her at first but I saw her the moment she walked in

She was a delivery woman

She came in with a hand cart full of packages,

She was an old school butch.



SMALL ALISON:

Someone just came in the door.

Like no one I ever saw before.

I feel...

I feel...



I don't know where you came from.

I wish I did

I feel so dumb.

I feel...



Your swagger and your bearing

and the just right clothes you're wearing

Your short hair and your dungarees

And your lace up boots.



And your keys oh

Your ring of keys.



I thought it was s'pposed to be wrong

But you seem okay with being strong

I want...to...

You're so...



It's probably conceited to say,

But I think we're alike in a certain way

I...um...



Your swagger and your bearing

and the just right clothes you're wearing

Your short hair and your dungarees

And your lace up boots.



And your keys oh

Your ring of keys.



Do you feel my heart saying hi?

In this whole luncheonette

Why am I the only one who see you're beautiful?



[Spoken]

No, I mean



[Sung]

Handsome!



Your swagger and your bearing

and the just right clothes you're wearing

Your short hair and your dungarees

And your lace up boots.



And your keys oh

Your ring of keys.



I know you

I know you

I know you
