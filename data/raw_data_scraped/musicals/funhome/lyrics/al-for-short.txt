Al for Short


Hey, hey

How ya doin'? Oh.

Al - ison, yeah sure, Al for short.

Hey, yeah oh yeah,

This is my Mustang convertible,

I found it at the dump - pow!

I fixed it up myself - blam!

Want a ride?

I'm going to Paris.

No? Alright! See ya later, yeah?



I'm in Paris in my 'Stang,

On the Boulé Boulevard -

Oh no! Did that man just shove that lady?

Did he make her cry?



Pardonnez-moi, mademoiselle,

Je voudrais to make sure everything is...uh, d'accord here.



- Mindez-vous your business!



I grab his arm, twist it behind his back -

Excusez-moi, monsieur, but I believe I was talking to the mademoiselle!



Merci, merci, you are

Très très gallant, what is your appelle?

Al - ison. Alison.

Alison? S'il vous plaît

Could I ride with you in your Mustang?

I don't know what it is about you,

But you make me feel so safe. Ah!

I don't know what it is about you,

But you make me feel so safe.



Yeah, sure. Oh, yeah sure.

Al - ison. Alison.

Al - ison. Al for short!
