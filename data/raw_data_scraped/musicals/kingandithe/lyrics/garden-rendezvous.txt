Lun Tha

I am Lun Tha. You are Misses Anna, the school teacher?



Anna

Yes, but you shouldn't be here...



Lun Tha

I must meet with Tuptim again, please.



Anna

You have being seen her here?



Lun Tha

Twice we've met. But each time it becomes more difficult.

She have said you are her friend who could help us.



Anna

Oh no, I couldn't. It's much too dangerous!

Not for me, but for Tuptim and you.



Lun Tha

Please, Misses Anna...



Anna

I'm sorry, Lun Tha, but there is nothing I can do.



Lun Tha

Wait there.



Lun Tha

Tuptim!



Tuptim

Oh, Lun Tha!



Lun Tha

Seeing you this way is not enough.



Tuptim

There is nothing we can do. I am watched too closely.



Lun Tha

Must we go on forever hiding a love like this?
