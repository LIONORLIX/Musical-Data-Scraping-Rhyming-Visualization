We Kiss in a Shadow


Lun Tha

We kiss in a shadow,

We hide from the moon,

Our meetings are few,

And over too soon.

We speak in a whisper,

Afraid to be heard;

When people are near,

We speak not a word.

Alone in our secret,

Together we sigh,

For one smiling day to be free

To kiss in the sunlight

And say to the sky:

"Behold and believe what you see!

Behold how my lover loves me!"

We speak in a whisper,

Afraid to be heard;

When people are near,

We speak not a word.

Alone in our secret,

Together we sigh,

For one smiling day to be free



Both

To kiss in the sunlight

And say to the sky:

"Behold and believe what you see!

Behold how my lover loves me!"



Tuptim

To kiss in the sunlight

And say to the sky:

"Behold and believe what you see!

Behold how my lover loves me!"
