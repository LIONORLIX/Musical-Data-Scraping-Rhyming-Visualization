Overture


THE ROYAL BANGKOK ACADEMY

from The King And I



We work and work from week to week

At the Royal Bangkok Academy,

And English words are all we speak

At the Royal Bangkok Academy.

If we pay attention to our teacher

And obey her every rule,

We'll be grateful for those golden years

At our dear old school.

The Royal Bangkok Academy,

Our dear old school.
