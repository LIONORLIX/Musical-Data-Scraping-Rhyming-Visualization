Thiang

To prove we're not barbarians

They dress us up like savages!

To prove we're not barbarians

We wear a funny skirt!

Ah...............h!



Wives

To prove we're not barbarians

They dress us up like savages!

To prove we're not barbarians

We wear a funny skirt!

Western People Funny,

Western People Funny,

Western People Funny,

Of that there is no doubt,

They feel so sentimental

About the Oriental,

They always try to turn us

Inside down down and upside out!



Wives

Upside out and inside down!



Thiang

To bruise and pinch our little toes-

Our feet are cramped in leather shoes-

They'd break if we had brittle toes,

But now they only hurt!

Ah...............h!



Wives

To bruise and pinch our little toes

Our feet are cramped in leather shoes,

They'd break if we had brittle toes,

But now they only hurt!

Western People Funny!

Western People Funny!

Too funny to be true!



Thiang Thiang

They think they civilise us Ah.....

Whenever they advise us

To learn to make the same mistake

That they are making too!

.............h!



All

THEY MAKE QUITE A FEW!
