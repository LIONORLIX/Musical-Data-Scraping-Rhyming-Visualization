Song of the King


King

A woman is a female who is human,

Designed for pleasing man, the human male.

A human male is pleased by many women,

And all the rest you hear is fairy tale.



Anna

Then tell me how this fairy tale began, sir.

You cannot call it just a poet's trick

Explain to me why many men are faithful

And true to one wife only-



King

[speaks]

They are sick!



[sings]

A girl must be like a blossom

With honey for just one man.

A man must be like honey bee

And gather all he can.

To fly from blossom to blossom

A honey bee must be free,

But blossom must not ever fly

From bee to bee to bee.



Anna

h your Majesty, in my country we have a far off different attitude.

We believe that for a man to be truly happy, he must love one woman,

and one woman.



King

This idea was invented by a woman!



Anna

Oh but it's a beautiful idea. And in England we are brought up

with it. And by the time a young girl goes to her first dance-



King

Young girl? They dance also like I see tonight - in arms of men

not her husband?



Anna

Well, of course!



King

I will not permit!
