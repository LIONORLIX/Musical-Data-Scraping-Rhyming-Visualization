Puzzlement


King

When I was a boy

World was better spot.

What was so was so,

What was not was not.

Now I am a man;

World have changed a lot.

Some things nearly so,

Others nearly not.

There are times I almost think

I am not sure of what I absolutely know.

Very often find confusion

In conclusion I concluded long ago

In my head are many facts

That, as a student, I have studied to procure,

In my head are many facts..

Of which I wish I was more certain I was sure!

[Spoken]

Is a puzzlement...



[Sung]

What to tell growing son

What for instance, shall I say to him of women?

Shall I educate him on the ancient lines?

Shall I tell the boy as far as he is able,

To respect his wives and love his concubines?

Shall I tell him everyone is like the other,

And the better of the two is really neither?

If I tell him this I think he won't believe it-

And I nearly think that I don't believe it either!-

When my father was a king

He was a king who knew exactly what he knew,

And his brain was not a thing

Forever swinging to and fro and fro and to.

Shall I, then be like my father

And be willfully unmovable and strong?

Or is it better to be right?...

Or am I right when I believe I may be wrong?



Shall I join with other nations in alliance?

If allies are weak, am I not best alone?

If allies are strong with power to protect me,

Might they not protect me out of all I own?

Is a danger to be trusting one another,

One will seldom want to do what other wishes;

But unless someday somebody trust somebody

There'll be nothing left on earth excepting fishes!



There are times I almost think

Nobody sure of what he absolutely know.

Everybody find confusion

In conclusion he concluded long ago

And it puzzle me to learn

That tho' a man may be in doubt of what he know,

Very quickly he will fight...

He'll fight to prove that what he does not know is so!



Oh-h-h-h-h-h Sometimes I think that people going mad!

Ah-h-h-h-h-h! Sometimes I think that people not so bad!

But not matter what I think

I must go on living life.

As leader of my kingdom I must go forth,

Be father to my children and husband to each wife

Etcetera, etcetera, and so forth.

If my Lord in Heaven Buddha, show the way,

Everyday I try to live another day.

If my Lord in Heaven Buddha, show the way,

Everyday I do my best for one-more day!



[Spoken]

But...Is a puzzlement!
