I Whistle a Happy Tune


Anna

Whenever I feel afraid

I hold my head erect

And whistle a happy tune

So no one will suspect

I'm Afraid.

While shivering in my shoes

I strike a careless pose

And whistle a happy tune

And no one ever knows I'm afraid.

The result of this deception

Is very strange to tell

For when I fool the people I fear

I fool myself as well!

I whistle a happy tune

And ev'ry single time

The happiness in the tune

Convinces me that I'm not afraid.

Make believe you're brave

And the trick will take you far.

You may be as brave

As you make believe you are

[Louis and Anna whistle the tune of

"Make believe you're brave

And the trick will take you far".]



Anna

You may be as brave

As you make believe you are!



Louis

[Spoken]

I think it is a very good idea, mother, a very good idea!



Anna

Yes, it is a good idea, isn't it!



Louis

I do think I shall never be afraid again!



Anna

Good!!!

[Sung]



Louis and Anna

The result of this deception

Is very strange to tell

For when I fool the people I fear

I fool myself as well!

I whistle a happy tune

And ev'ry single time

The happiness in the tune

Convinces me that I'm not afraid.



Make believe you're brave

And the trick will take you far.

You may be as brave

As you make believe you are-

You may be as brave

As you make believe you are!
