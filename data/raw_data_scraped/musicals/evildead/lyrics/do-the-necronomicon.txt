Do the Necronomicon


CHERYL

Now we honor the Necronomicon



FEMALE CANDARIAN DEMONS

Now we honor the Necronomicon



ALL CANDARIAN DEMONS

Now we honor the Necronomicon

Now we honor the Necronomicon



LEAD

Now we honor the Necronomicon

With our very own special dance



ASH

How the hell do demons do their very own special dance?



LEAD

In hell we dance our own special way

Let`s show him how we dance while our bodies decay



SHELLY

Do we bounce like Backstreet?



LEAD

Not without a heartbeat



JAKE

Do we grind like Michale Bivens?



LEAD

Bel Biv Devoe before the living.



LINDA

Do we whoop like Tag Team?



LEAD

Not without a bloodstream



ED

Let`s Macarena like that group did!



LEAD

No that`s just stupid



ALL CANDARIAN DEMONS

Deadite zombies like to get their freak on

And when we get together they do the Necronomicon

Do the Necronomicon

Do the Necronomicon

Come on, come on

And do the Necronomicon



LEAD

You gotta follow the moves



(Jake and Ed grunt)



Right to the letter



(Shelly squeals)



It`s just like the time warp



OTHER CANDARIAN DEMONS

What?!?!?!?!



LEAD

Only better!



OTHER CANDARIAN DEMONS

(Cheer)



ALL CANDARIAN DEMONS

First we jump

Then we sit down

Then we get back up

And lasso all around

Then we spin

Clap our hands

(Four claps)

Then take a big moment to acknowledge the band

(Cheering)

Do the robot

And the sprinkler

And finish it off with our best Henry Winkler

?Ay!?



Deadite zombies like to get their freak on

And when we get together they do the Necronomicon

Do the Necronomicon

Do the Necronomicon

Come on, come on

And do the Necronomicon



SHELLY

Can we kill these suckers yet?



LEAD

Just wait a little bit



JAKE

Can we beat them with a shoe?



LEAD

Not ?til we?re done the tune



CHERYL

Can we mutilate these fools?



LEAD

No! Follow the rules



ED

I say we attack!



LEAD

What are you on? Crack?

After our dance we?ll attack our old friends

But before we do that, let`s Necronomicon again



OTHER CANDARIAN DEMONS

(Cheer)



ALL CANDARIAN DEMONS

First we jump

Then we sit down

Then we get back up

And lasso all around

Then we spin

Clap our hands

(Four claps)

Then take a big moment to acknowledge the band

(Cheering)

Do the robot

And the sprinkler

And finish it off with our best Henry Winkler

?Ay!?



Deadite zombies like to get their freak on

And when we get together they do the Necronomicon



Do the Necronomicon



Do the Necronomicon
