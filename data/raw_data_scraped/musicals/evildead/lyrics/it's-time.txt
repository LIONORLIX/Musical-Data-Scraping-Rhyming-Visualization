It's Time


ASH

It`s time

To fulfill my purpose

In life

We are born with a destiny

It's time

To accept my calling

To go

On a ravenous demon-killing spree

It`s time to finally take a stand

Fight with my stump and my good hand

Stop talking trash

And kick some demon ass

It is time



UNNAMED CANDARIAN DEMON

Oh, it`s time, Ash, but not for what you think.



CANDARIAN DEMONS

It`s time for you

Ash to die

It`s time for us

Zombies to rise

It`s time for you

To say goodbye

It`s time for

Oh it`s time

Ooo ooo ooo



ASH

It`s time

Time to hurt demon feelings

Inside

These here walls there can be only one

It`s time* (Candarian demons join in)

To increase demon bleeding

Tonight

You will die by the saw or the gun

Time

To harass

Time

To whoop some ass

Time to kill

Demons en mass

Oh, it's time



CANDARIAN DEMONS*

Time to fight

Time to brawl

Time to kill

Time to maul

Kick you square

In the balls

It`s time to-oo rip you to ta-atters

Time to-oo make your blood splatter

Through the shed

Join the evil dead

It is time



ASH

You know that I`m right

I`m not dying tonight

It`s a holiday

When I`m in despair

I adjust my hair

And make evil pay

At the edge of the night

There`s not a Deadite

I can`t handle



CANDARIAN DEMONS

Handle



ASH

When danger calls

You must have the balls

Of an ox or a bear or any large mammal



CANDARIAN DEMONS

Any large mammal

Yeah!

It`s time for you



CANDARIAN DEMONS / ASH

Ash to die / Is that so



CANDARIAN DEMONS

It`s time for us



CANDARIAN DEMONS / ASH

Zombies to rise / I sing no-o



CANDARIAN DEMONS

It`s time for you



CANDARIAN DEMONS

To say goodbye / Alright let`s go-o



CANDARIAN DEMONS

It`s time for

Oh



ALL

It`s time
