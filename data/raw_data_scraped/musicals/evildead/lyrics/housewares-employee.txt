Housewares Employee


ASH

Little did I know that day

When I dropped off my resume

At the local S-Mart store

That another employee I'd fall for



LINDA

My job was in the check out aisle

S-Mart service with a smile

I hated work, it was a bore

But all that changed when you walked through the door



ASH

I was assigned to Aisle Three



LINDA

And that is where you fell for me



ASH

A love so strong it had to be



LINDA

Perfect retail...



BOTH

Harmony

I have to ask a question to the gods above

How were we deemed worthy of this perfect love?

I'll ask the trees, I'll ask the sky

I'll ask the whole wide world



ASH

How did a Housewares Employee land the perfect girl?



LINDA

How did the perfect girl land a Housewares Employee?



I could barely focus on my checkout line

Your polyester shirt always on my mind

Fantasies took over my

I'd forget to scan items and give'em for free



ASH

How could I concentrate on Housewares?

Who cares about blenders when you're right there?

Our roles reversed, there is no doubt

'Cause I was the one who was checking you out



LINDA

I had a major crush on you



ASH

When I was near you my love grew



LINDA

Finding love at work, it must have been fate



ASH

It's better than meeting on a ElimiDATE



BOTH

I have to ask a question to the gods above

How were we deemed worthy of this perfect love?

I'll ask the trees, I'll ask the sky

I'll ask the whole wide world



ASH

How did a Housewares Employee land the perfect girl?



LINDA

How did the perfect girl land a Housewares Employee?



ASH

Stocking the shelves

Was all I thought would be

But finding my true love at S-Mart

That makes this job so groovy



LINDA

I have to ask a question...



BOTH

To the gods above

How were we deemed worthy of this perfect love?

I'll ask the trees, I'll ask the sky

I'll ask the whole wide world



ASH

How did a Housewares Employee land the perfect girl?



LINDA

How did the perfect girl land a...



BOTH

Housewares Employee?
