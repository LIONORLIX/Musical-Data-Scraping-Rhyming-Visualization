ANNIE

All the men in my life keep getting killed by Candarian Demons



ASH

All the men in your life keep getting killed by Candarian Demons.



ANNIE

First there was Ed, a really nice guy.

Didn`t talk too much but I didn`t mind.

I was all set to marry him, but

before we could consummate Ed was killed by a Candarian Demon.



ASH & JAKE

Candarian Demon, Candarian Demon, Candarian Demon



ANNIE

Then it was Daddy



ASH & JAKE

Daddy



ANNIE

Who I could count on.



ASH & JAKE

Awoo



ANNIE

He loved to read the Necronomicon



ASH & JAKE

Book of the Dead



ANNIE

He also enjoyed playing board games.

But he can`t sink my battleship now

`cause Dad was killed by a Candarian Demon.







ASH & JAKE

Candarian Demon, Candarian Demon, Candarian Demon`



ANNIE

They say love is cruel and I believe them, my heart`s always broken.

`Cause the men in my life keep getting killed by Candarian Demons. Why`



JAKE

I don`t know.



ASH

Annie baby, I know it seems bad now: it always does!

But I think you`re exaggerating a touch Sugar Bean.

I mean, sure, your father and fianc` were killed by Candarian Demons,

but that`s only two men, isn`t it`

I mean there`s no way that

ALL the men in your life could have been killed by Candarian Demons!



ANNIE

Oh, no` It was high school



ASH & JAKE

High School



ANNIE

Senior prom.



ASH & JAKE

Oh yeah!



ANNIE

Going with my steady Howie Brown.



ASH & JAKE

Howie Brown



ANNIE

A perfect night



ASH & JAKE

Howie Brown`



ANNIE

Like I always dreamed.





ASH & JAKE

A little girl`s dream`



ANNIE

But when `Stairway to Heaven` began

Howe was killed by a Candarian Demon.



ASH & JAKE

Candarian Demon, Candarian Demon, Candarian Demon



ANNIE

All my college boyfriends and my one-night stands!

My male co-workers and platonic gay friends.



ASH & JAKE

Hey!



ANNIE

Every date I go on ends in demon bloodshed.

And now that I`ve met you two guys I know you`ll soon be dead!



ASH & JAKE

What the f--`



ANNIE

They say love is cruel



ASH & JAKE,

Shoop shoo-wa



ANNIE

and I believe them



ASH & JAKE

Shoop shoo-wa



ANNIE

my heart`s always broken.

`Cause the men

in my life`and I mean ALL the men (in my life)

EVERY single man!`in my life,

keeps getting killed by Candarian Demons!
