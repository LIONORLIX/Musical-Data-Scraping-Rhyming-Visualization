Good..Bad..I'm the Guy with the Gun


Ash,

Listen, baby! I`m not just some preppy boy toy you can just push around, see.

I killed that guy already!



Annie,

How can you be so heartless, so bad?



Ash,

Good`bad`I`m the guy with the gun.



Annie,

I still don`t know what you`re even doing here in the cabin!



Ash,

I could ask you the same question!



Annie,

It`s my families cabin!



Ash,

Did I ask?



Annie,

Are all men from Michigan such loud mouth braggarts!



Ash,

Nope`just me, baby`just me!
