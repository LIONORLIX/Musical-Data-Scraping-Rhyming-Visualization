Bit Part Demon


Ed:

I'm that guy you see in every horror flick.

You may not remember me, I come and go too quick.



You wouldn't know my name, I hardly ever speak a line.

If the hero kills a hundred demons, I'd be the forgettable number

thirty nine.



'Cuz I'm a bit part demon, a small time misfit.

I'd say you'd be dead by dawn but I don't really mean it.



I'm a threat to no one, the other deadites make fun...



Cheryl:

YOU SUCK!



Ed:

Of me. Evil Eddie. Oh The bit part demon.



Annie:

But don't you see Ed? We've been listening to you talk for the past two minutes.

You've said a whole lot just now. Just you!

Aw, you're not a bit part demon anymore. You're a lead player. A star!



Ed:

You're right! Now I see that this trend has been disrupted.

I've said more than five words without being interrupted! I'm a

bit part no more! My character's at a swing!

And now its time for this demon to sing, sing sing! Ahhhh....(gunshot) oh!



Ash:

Now you'll have a bit part; in hell.
