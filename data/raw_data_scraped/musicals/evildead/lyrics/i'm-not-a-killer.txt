I'm Not A Killer


ASH

Now it's time to die, you old hag!



LINDA

You found me beautiful once.



ASH

Honey, you got real ugly.



I'm not a killer,

I'm an S-Mart employee.

And to kill a coworker

Is against company policy.



But you tried to kill me,

So now I must say goodbye.

I'm sorry Linda,

But now you must die!



Die, die

Die, die

Die, die

Die, die

Die, die

Die, die

Oh die

Oh die



ANNIE

Daddy, I'm home!



ASH

Uh, this isn't as bad as it looks!
