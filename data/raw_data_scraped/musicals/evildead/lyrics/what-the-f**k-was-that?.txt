What the F**k Was That?


ASH AND SCOTT

What the fuck was that?



SCOTT

Your sister has turned into a zombie



ASH AND SCOTT

What the fuck was that?



ASH

Your girlfriend was a demon too



ASH AND SCOTT

What the fuck was that?



SCOTT

She just ripped my pre-ripped Abercrombie



ASH AND SCOTT

What the fuck was that?



ASH

I got some Shelly on my shoe



ASH AND SCOTT

What darkness lurks beyond this wooden sanctum?

What the fuck was that?



SCOTT

Dude, these hoes been zombefied!

I cannot stay here anymore

I'm getting out of here!



ASH

No, we cannot leave, Linda's ankle won't make it, I fear



SCOTT

I cannot stay, I killed my lay!

I must go now



ASH

You can't go now



SCOTT

I must!



ASH

You can't!



SCOTT

I must



ASH

You can't!



SCOTT

Bitches out for blood!

I can't take this anymore



ASH

We don't even know if there's a way back

Except for that damn broken foorbridge



SCOTT

Gotta go!

Right now!

I'll find a road where I'll flag down a van!



ASH

Just listen to me



SCOTT

No I won't!



ASH

Linda can't walk



SCOTT

It's time to go!



ASH

Cannot hike

Can't even stand



SCOTT

Then we'll leave her

That's our brand-new...



ASH AND SCOTT

Plan

What the fuck was that?



SCOTT

Now I'll put an end to this vacation



ASH AND SCOTT

What the fuck was that?



ASH

Scott, don't leave me all alone



ASH AND SCOTT

Necronomicon

The Book of the Dead



ASH

The Chant



SCOTT

A curse



ASH

The chicks



SCOTT

I'm gone!



ASH AND SCOTT

What the fuck was that?

It's the Evil Dead!
