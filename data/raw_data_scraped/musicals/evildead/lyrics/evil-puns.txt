Evil Puns


Cheryl,

I`ll get you, Ash! I`m like a literal Hulk Hogan, I`ll get you brother!



Ash,

Shut-up!



Cheryl,

We`re like that Columbia house, ten CD`s for a penny club. Sooner or later, you`ll join us!



Ash,

Shut-up!



Cheryl,

I`m like Dom DeLuise at all you can eat fish house. I`ll swallow your soul!



Ash,

God, shut-up!



Cheryl,

It`ll be like you were killed by some guy who`s first name happens to be Dawn and you`ll be dead`by Dawn`



Ash,

That is it!
