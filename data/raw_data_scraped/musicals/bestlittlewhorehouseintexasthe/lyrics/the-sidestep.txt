The Sidestep


Fellow Texans, I am proudly standing here to humbly say.

I assure you, and I mean it- Now, who says I don't speak out as plain as day?

And, fellow Texans, I'm for progress and the flag- long may it fly.

I'm a poor boy, come to greatness. So, it follows that I cannot tell a lie.



Ooh I love to dance a little sidestep, now they see me now they don't-

I've come and gone and, ooh I love to sweep around the wide step,

cut a little swathe and lead the people on.



Now my good friends, it behooves me to be solemn and declare,

I'm for goodness and for profit and for living clean and saying daily prayer.

And now, my good friends, you can sleep nights, I'll continue to stand tall.

You can trust me, for I promise, I shall keep a watchful eye upon ya'll...



Ooh I love to dance a little sidestep, now they see me now they don't-

I've come and gone and, ooh I love to sweep around the wide step,

cut a little swathe and lead the people on.



Now, Miss Mona, I don't know her, though I've heard the name, oh yes.

But, of course I've no close contact, so what she is doing I can only guess.

And now, Miss Mona, she's a blemish on the face of that good town.

I am taking certain steps here, someone somewhere's gonna have to close her down.



Ooh I love to dance a little sidestep, now they see me now they don't-

I've come and gone and, ooh I love to sweep around the wide step,

cut a little swathe and lead the people on.



Ooh I love to dance a little sidestep...



And, ooh I love to sweep around the wide step...



Cut a little swathe and lead the people on.
