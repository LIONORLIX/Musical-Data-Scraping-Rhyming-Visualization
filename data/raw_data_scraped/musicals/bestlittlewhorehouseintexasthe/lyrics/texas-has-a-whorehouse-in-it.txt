Texas Has A Whorehouse In It


(Chorus) Watch dog will get you if you don't watch out

Watch dog sees and watch dog knows.

Watch keeps us on our toes

Watch dog assures you that the laws the law

No exception to the rule, watch dog ain't no fool.



Watch dog protects you, he's out on the prowl.

Guards and checks the best he can ,watch dog is a

fighting man.

Watch dog will throw, he's beam of light around

If some folks don't toe the line, watch dog's light

will shine.



(Solo) Texas has a whorehouse in it.



(Chorus) lord have mercy on our souls.



(Solo) Texas has a whorehouse in it.



(Chorus) lord have mercy on our souls.



(Solo) I'll expose the facts although it fills me with disgust

Please excuse the filthy dark details, and carnal lust.



(Chorus) Filthy dark details, and carnal lust.



(Solo) Dancing going on inside it, don't you see they gone

I inquired no one denied it, now I think I'm getting

riled

Bodies close together, arms and legs all rearranged.

And the sheriff does not close him down.

That's very strange.



(Chorus) Does not close him down ,that's very strange.



(Solo) Mean eyed juiced up brillitene honkytonk cowboys.



(Chorus) Oh no



(Solo) Mixing with green eyed thin lipped hard as nails

peroxide blonds.



(Chorus) Oh no



(Solo) Not to mention some types ,that you never guess would

venture near.

I can all depraved and loose and wild, ninety miles

from here.

And now our own Melvin P Thorp Sangers.



(Chorus) Texas has a whorehouse in it



(Solo) I'll not let this scandal fade



(Chorus) Texas has a whorehouse in it



(Solo) All uprooting , our crusade.

I can smell corruption, and I'll fight it to the top.

Loveless copulation going on.

And it must stop.



(Chorus) Stop this copulation

Stop that copulation

Loveless copulation

Stop that copulation



Texas has a whorehouse in it.

lord have mercy on our souls.

Texas has a whorehouse in it.

lord have mercy on our souls.

Watch dog smell corruption and will fight it to the top.

Loveless copulation going on, going on, going on, going

on, going on

going on.



(Solo) Don't touch that dial

This is Melvin P Thorp saying I'll be back, with new and

revealing

information about this and other cases.

Watch dog never sleeps.



(Chorus) And it must stop.

Watch dog going to get you

Going to shine his light on you

Watch dog going to get you

Going to shine his light on you.
