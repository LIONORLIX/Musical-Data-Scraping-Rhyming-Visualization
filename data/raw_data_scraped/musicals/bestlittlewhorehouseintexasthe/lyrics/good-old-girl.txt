Good Old Girl


SHERIFF

Well, shes a good old girl

We've been some long, long miles together

And thank the Lord, she never was the clinging kind



But she's a good old girl

We've had some fine big laughs together

And I admired the way she almost read my mind



Never talked no foolish talk

Had no ties, and held no rules

Hell that good old girl and me,

We ain't damn fools, you know?



We never talked too much

We didn't hold to conversation

There's lots of things I could have told her I suppose.



But what I'd would want to tell that good old girl, she knows.

Hell that good old girl and me,
