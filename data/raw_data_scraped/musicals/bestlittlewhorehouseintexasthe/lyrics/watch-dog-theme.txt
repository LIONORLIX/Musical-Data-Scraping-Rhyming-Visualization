Watch Dog Theme


Watchdog will get you if you don't watch out. Watchdog sees and watchdog knows. Watchdog keeps us on our toes.



Watchdog assures you that the law's the law. No exceptions to the rule. Watchdog ain't no fool.



Watchdog protects you, he's out on the prowl. Guards and checks the best he can, Watchdog is a fighting man.



Watchdog will throw his beam of light around. If some folks don't tow the line, Watchdog's light will shine.
