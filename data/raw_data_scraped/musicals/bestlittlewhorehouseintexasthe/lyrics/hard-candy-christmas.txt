Hard Candy Christmas


Hey, maybe i'll dye my hair

Maybe i'll move somewhere

Maybe i'll get a car

Maybe i'll drive so far

They'll all lose track

Me, i'll bounce right back

Maybe i'll sleep real late

Maybe i'll lose some weight

Maybe i'll clear my junk

Maybe i'll just get drunk on apple wine

Me, i'll be just



Fine and dandy

Lord it's like a hard candy christmas

I'm barely getting through tomorrow

But still i won't let

Sorrow bring me way down



I'll be fine and dandy

Lord it's like a hard candy christmas

I'm barely getting through tomorrow

But still i won't let

Sorrow get me way down



Hey, maybe i'll learn to sew

Maybe i'll just lie low

Maybe i'll hit the bars

Maybe i'll count the stars until dawn

Me, i will go on



Maybe i'll settle down

Maybe i'll just leave town

Maybe i'll have some fun

Maybe i'll meet someone

And make him mine

Me, i'll be just



Fine and dandy

Lord it's like a hard candy christmas

I'm barely getting throung tomorrow

But still i won't let

Sorrow bring me way down



I'll be fine and dandy

Lord it's like a hard candy christmas

I'm barely getting through tomorrow

But still i won't let

Sorrow bring me way down



I'll be fine and dandy

Lord it's like a hard candy christmas

I'm barely getting through tomorrow

But still i won't let

Sorrow bring me way down



'cause i'll be fine

(i'll be fine)

Oh, i'll be fine
