BANDLEADER



(opening monologue)



Oh the little house lay in a green Texas glade where the,

trees were as cooling as fresh lemonade.



Soft summer wind held a trace of perfume.

And a fan was turning in every room.



BANDLEADER (add CHORUS)

Twenty fans were turning

They were turning

Twenty fans were turning

In every room



Fevers were-a burning

The were burning

And they had to have-a

Way to cool down.



(spoken monologue)



BANDLEADER

It had nice watermelons all covered in vines.

And-a vegetable garden, a few slender pines.



White painted fence, with the roses in bloom.

And a fan was turning in every room



BANDLEADER (add chorus)

Twenty fans were humming

They were humming

Twenty fans were humming

In every room



Customers were coming

They were coming

And they had to have-a

Way to cool down.



(spoken monologue)



Twenty fans were turning

They were turning

Twenty fans were turning

In every room



Fevers were-a burning

They were burning

And they had to have-a

Way to cool down



Twenty fans were turning

They were turning

Twenty fans were turning

In every room



Customers were coming

They were coming

And they had to have-a

Way to cool down



Twenty fans were turning

They were turning

Twenty fans were turning

In every room



Fevers were-a burning

They were burning

And they had to have-a

Way to cool down
