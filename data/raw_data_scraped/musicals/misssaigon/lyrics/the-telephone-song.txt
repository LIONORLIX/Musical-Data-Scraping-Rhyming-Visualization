The Telephone Song


[CHRIS]

John, is that you, buddy? Listen to me

Do I sound diff'rent? how else could I be?

Last night I spent a whole lifetime in paradise.

Hey, tell the CO I'm taking all of my leave

We're gonna play house, oh John, it's like Christmas eve

We have sworn we won't see the sun for forty-eight hours



[JOHN at the Embassy, in the midst of chaos: files being]

[packed or burned, typewriters crated, etc.]



[JOHN]

What are you saying? Are you out of your mind?

All leaves are canceled, you could be left behind

Saigon is falling apart, and you'd better be here

Here is the news, since you've been on the moon

Cities in the boondocks are dropping like flies

Wives and civilians will be shipping out soon

Crowds around the Embassy have tears in their eyes

Thieu has resigned, the new regime may not hold

People at the place think we'll send the marines

We are sending nothing from what I've been told

Buddy, are you there? Do you know what this means?

Sure! Time to fall in love!



[CHRIS]

John, listen fast, you did not get this call

You're the one who bought the girl for me after all

"Once you're a friend, you're a friend through and through"

When you are in trouble, then I'll cover for you



[JOHN]

Not this time, the town's too hot

For one Kongai whore

Ol' buddy, I will not get you killed



[CHRIS]

She is no whore, you saw her too

She's really more, like... the April moon



[JOHN]

April fuckin' moon!!



[CHRIS]

She's been hurt, you see

Both her parents died

What else could she be?



[JOHN]

Sweet as that, and she's an orphan too!

How can a guy fight that? You got one day, not two

Then be back!
