TOURISTS

I'm glad my wife's not here with me!



ENGINEER

what a waste!

to pay for my keep

I'm rounding up sheep

to fleece here in Bangkok



I'm disgraced

I can't get ahead

there's nothing as dead

as peace here in Bangkok



ten cents an hour, that's all they pay

I'll have to swim to the USA

if you're looking for fun

original sin

if you want to put out

then you gotta come in



DOORMEN

girls! I got girls!



DOORMEN

gorgeous girls!



DOORMEN

very nice!



ENGINEER

gee, isn't Bangkok really neat?

the things they're selling on the street.

fresh dog, if that's what you'd enjoy

a girl, or if you want a boy



DOORMEN

girls!

i got girls!

girls!

worth the price!



DOORMEN and the ENGINEER

come, come to me

first drink is free



ENGINEER

don't be a lump, you can hump

for a small extra fee



hump - "humpy, humpy"



ENGINEER

I'm depressed

for hustling amours

to Japanese tours

is no treat in Bangkok



I'm the best

but selling these runts

for sexual stunts

leaves me beat in Bangkok



ten cents an hour...



CLUB OWNER

you said you'd fill my place up - where are they?



ENGINEER

they're coming, Boss



CLUB OWNER

Just get to work, half-breed!



ENGINEER

...screw the Siamese

look how they're ripping off... refugees



ENGINEER

if you're looking for fun

original sin

if you want to put out

then you gotta come in



DOORMEN ENGINEER

hey boys, don't stand around like wimps.

watch out, those guys, they're really pimps.

you want some thrills, come-on and grab it!

three girls, two gerbils, and a rabbit



DOORMEN

girls!

i got girls!

girls!

half the price!



DOORMEN

hey, come to me!



DOORMEN

look what you'll see!



ENGINEER

hey, that's a joke, mine blow smoke

for a small extra fee



VENDORS

come try the streets in every venue

with tricks, you'll pick from off the menu



ENGINEER

hey, Joe, try taking a little excursion

you'll all feel good from a little perversion.

massage requiring total immersion.

some strange positions they say are Persian.



ENGINEER

drinks are on me

first girl is free

what can I say? You get me

for a small extra fee!



ENGINEER

you want a girl sir? you'll like one of these



JOHN

you have a Kim here, can I see her please?



ENGINEER

you pick 'em well. . .



monsieur John, is that you?



JOHN

the Engineer!

Jesus Christ! you're here too



ENGINEER

of all my friends, you're the one that I miss



JOHN

I'm looking for Kim



ENGINEER

I love you so, you and your buddy Chris



JOHN

I'm here about him

Kim has a child born in...



BOTH

seventy-five



ENGINEER

I filled that out and it's you who arrive

you'll find the end of your quest here in our little dive



I'm impressed

American clerks, a system that works

there's really no other



JOHN

listen, spare me the gas

is there really a child?



ENGINEER

yes, we're blessed

and Kim's on a trip

for citizenship, and I am her brother



JOHN

you're her brother, my ass

come on, take me inside



ENGINEER

look Kim, who got our application

I said I'd bring us all salvation



KIM

oh my god! monsieur John!

yes, of course he sent you



JOHN

not in here, is there someplace near we could talk?



KIM

Take your hands off! We're finished! Go find someone else!



JOHN

come with me, there's a lot I've got to say first



KIM

Chris is here! say he's here! oh my god, it's all true



ENGINEER

I suggest, whatever may be

you leave it to me

just play little mother



JOHN

what I need to find out

she can tell me alone



KIM

can you take me to Chris?

I can leave here right now

we've been here for so long

took this job to survive

one month at sea

I was sure we'd drown

but I thought about Chris

and we didn't go down

I've done terrible things

but we're safe and you're here

so perhaps all the gods

have begun to forgive



CLUB OWNER

did the gentleman order champagne?



ENGINEER

she was about to get it



CLUB OWNER

you better get back on the chain, or get out



KIM ENGINEER

monsieur John I'm so sick of that prick

quick before he gets wise

look at this let John look at your kid

come see love see the lids of his eyes

come see Chris let John have his surprise



ENGINEER

look Uncle Sam

how nice I am

I doing all this just for Tam

an American boy



KIM

look John, this is his son

don't they have the same the smile

he's been waiting for his father

for a long, long while.
