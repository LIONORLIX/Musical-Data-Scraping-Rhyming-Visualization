What's This I Find


the door opens. A stranger enters.)



THUY

you're here. It's true

it is as I was told

this man, and you

for how much were you sold?

our vows! Our name!

you squander them on swine

and worse! The shame!

before your family's shrine



CHRIS

this girl is mine!



THUY

yours?



CHRIS

now



THUY

what!



TOGETHER

who are you?



KIM

stop!



THUY

what's this I find?

you have joined with the blind

and do none of you see what's ahead?

what's this I find?

I see losers and whores

who will soon all be gone or be dead



CHRIS

get out!



KIM

you have no right to be here

I'm not a prize you can claim

we were promised at thirteen

the woman I've become is not the same



THUY

that promise made by your father I will claim when we win

to break a vow of your parents is worse than a sin



KIM

my parents got themselves killed in the week you changed side

if there were promises all of them died when they died



(CHRIS and THUY pull guns. The girl scream.)



GIGI

he's got a gun!



(GIGI and the GIRLS leave quickly)



THUY

Kim, leave this man behind



KIM

go on!

and shoot!

I will not change my mind!



THUY

you're still mine!



KIM

not anymore!



THUY

you're mine until we die!



CHRIS

get out of here!



THUY

Saigon

will fall

and so will your GI



CHRIS

she'll leave with me



THUY

you broke your father's word

this is your curse!



(THUY runs out and down the stairs. CHRIS runs out after him but he's

gone. CHRIS returns to the room and takes KIM in his arms
