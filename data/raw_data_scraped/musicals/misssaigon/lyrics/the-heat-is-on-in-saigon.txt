The Heat Is On In Saigon


["Dreamland" is a club filled with American Marines,]

[civilians and south Vietnamese officers. The girls parade]

[around and get the crowd to buy  raffle tickets:]

[the winner of the "beauty contest" will be the prize.]



[AMERICANS]

The heat is on in Saigon

The girls are hotter 'n' hell

One of these slits here will be Miss Saigon

God, the tension is high, not to mention the smell

The heat is on in Saigon

Is there a war going on?

Don't ask, I ain't gonna tell



[Two friends, CHRIS and JOHN, are among the Marines. JOHN is with one of the girls]



[ENGINEER]

Ah, Monsieur Chris! Monsieur John!

You've come to win Miss Saigon



[JOHN]

I gotta get my friend laid as a last souvenir



[CHRIS]

I love you, pal, but your bullshit

I've had up to here



[ENGINEER, CHRIS AND JOHN]

The heat is on in Saigon



[JOHN]

But 'til they tell us we're gone

I'm gonna buy you a girl



[CHRIS]

You can buy me a beer



[The girls leave the men and move onto the stage]



[MIMI]

See my bikini, it's just the right size



[YVETTE]

Don't you enjoy how it rides up my thighs?

Look from behind, it'll knock out your eyes



[YVONNE]

I'll show you: my special trophy of war



[MIMI]

For a Marine, I'll show more



[AMERICANS]

You won't get up off the floor

The heat is on in Saigon

Don't tell me I'm reassigned, all that chickenshit sucks

Tonight I'm out of my mind, not to mention ten bucks



[GIGI]

If I'm your pin-up, I'll melt all your brass

Stuck on your wall, with a pin in my ass

If you get me, you will travel first class

I'll show you, we will make magic, ch?ri



[ENGINEER]

You buy more tickets from me

The winner gets her for free



[CHRIS]

The meat is cheap in Saigon

I used to love getting stoned, waking up with some whore

I don't know why I went dead, it's not fun anymore



[KIM]

I'm seventeen, and I'm new here today

The village I come from seems so far away

All of the girls know much more what to say

But I know

I have a heart like the sea

A million dreams are in me



[CHRIS]

Good Jesus, John, who is she?



[AMERICANS (AND CROWD)]

The Cong is tight'ning the noose

Is it a week or a day or an hour that we got?

Tonight could be our last shot got to put it to use



[The GIRLS come off the stage and mingle with the men.]



[ALL, INCLUDING GIRLS]

Tonight I bet that you and I will get along

Forget about the threat, forget the Viet-Cong



[ALL MEN]

Mimi, Gigi, Yvette or Yvonne

Gonna buy me a beer, and elect Miss Saigon



[The ENGINEER holds the election by holding his hand over]

[each girl's head for applause. When KIM is judged, CHRIS]

[claps loudly, which makes her notice him.]



[ENGINEER]

Yvonne, Yvette, Mimi, Kim, Gigi



[GIGI wins]



[ENGINEER]

Attention, s'il vous plait!

By popular demand

Miss Gigi Van Tranh

Is elected Miss Saigon!



[The ENGINEER  puts a cheap tiara on GIGI and a ribbon which says "Miss Saigon".]



[AMERICANS]

The heat is on in Saigon

And things are not going well

But still at midnight, the party goes on

A good-bye party in hell



[ENGINEER]

And now who wins this pussycat?



[The ENGINEER holds a bowl; GIGI picks up a ticket.]



[GIGI]

Number 66!



[It is one of the Marines. He cheers with his friends. The scene freezes.]
