Bui-Doi


They're called Bui-Doi.

The dust of life.

Conceived in Hell,

And born in strife.

They are the living reminder of all the good we failed to do.

We can't forget

Must not forget

That they are all our children, too.



Like all survivors I once thought

When I?m home I won?t give a damn

But now I know I?m caught, I?ll never leave Vietnam



War isn?t over when it ends, some pictures never leave youmind.

They are the faces of the children the ones we left behind

They?re called Bui-doi.

The dust of life, conceived in hell and born in strife

They are the living reminders of all the good we failed to do

That?s why we know deep in our hearts, that they are all ourchildren too



These kids hit walls on ev?ry side, they don?t belong in anyplace.

Their secret they can?t hide it?s printed on their face.

I never thought one day I?d plead

For half-breeds from a land that?s torn

But then I saw a camp for children whose crime was being born



They?re called Bui-Doi, the dust of life conceived in hell andborn in strife.

We owe them fathers and a family a loving home they never knew.

Because we know deep in our hearts that they are all our childrentoo.



These are souls in need, they need us to give

Someone has to pay for their chance to live

Help me try



They're called Bui-Doi.

The dust of life.

Conceived in Hell,

And born in strife.

They are the living reminders of all the good we failed to do.

That's why we know

That's why we know

Deep in our hearts

Deep in our hearts

That's why we know

That they are all our children, too.
