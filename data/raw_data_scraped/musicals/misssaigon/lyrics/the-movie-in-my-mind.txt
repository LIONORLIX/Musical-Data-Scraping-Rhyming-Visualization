The Movie In My Mind


[GIGI]

They are not nice, they're mostly noise

They swear like men, they screw like boys

I know there's nothing in their hearts

But every time I take one in my arms

It starts:

The movie in my mind

The dream they leave behind

A scene I can't erase

And in a strong GI's embrace

Flee this life

Flee this place

The movie plays and plays

The screen before me fills

He takes me to New York

He gives me dollar bills

Our children laugh all day

And eat too much ice cream

And life is like a dream

Dream

The dream I long to find

The movie in my mind



[KIM]

I will not cry, I will not think

I'll do my dance, I'll make them drink

When I make love, it won't be me

And if they hurt me, I'll just close my eyes



[KIM, GIRLS]

And see they are not nice, they're mostly noise

The movie in my mind they kill like men, they die like boys

The dream that fills my head they give their cash, they keep their hearts

A man who will not kill but every night again it starts



[KIM]

Who'll fight for me instead

He'll keep us safe all day

So no one comes at night

To blow the dream away

Dream

The dream I have to find

The movie in my mind



[ALL GIRLS]

And in a strong GI's embrace

Flee this life

Flee this place



[KIM]

A world that's far away

Where life is not unkind

The movie in my mind
