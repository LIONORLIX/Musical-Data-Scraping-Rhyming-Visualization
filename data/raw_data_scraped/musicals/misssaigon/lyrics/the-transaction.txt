The Transaction


[ENGINEER]

Hey monsieur John, how'd you like to get rich

Go home in style. . .?



[JOHN]

Yeah okay, what's the pitch?



[ENGINEER]

A U.S. visa to help me out

Lend me a bit of your embassy clout



[JOHN]

There isn't a chance pal, you're too well known

Look, what I want is that girl in the dress



[ENGINEER]

You have a good eye

Her name is Kim, she's my new princess

You give her a try?



[JOHN]

It's my friend Chris

Who's the one feeling down



[MARINE]

I ordered a beer!



[ENGINEER]

She'll get him up,

It's her first night in town

But I have to warn you

She don't come cheap

It's got to be twenty for my princess



[JOHN]

Twenty dollars??



[ENGINEER]

She's sort of a virgin, well more or less

For twenty more you get a room and key

For fifty bucks, she's got the whole night free



[MARINES]

No one gives us a buzz

Like the Engineer does



[JOHN approaches CHRIS with Kim]



[JOHN]

Stop drooling white boy

You're losing your cool

You like this jail bait



[CHRIS]

John, open your eyes

This is the end of the line

This whole rotten scene

This little girl, we could be in the sack

For what it costs me to buy a big mac

John, it's time to go back -

You know what I mean



[JOHN]

I'm starting to cry pal

You're so out of touch

The trouble with you is you think too much

Oh

Ol' Dr. John knows what you need alright

I've bought you a present

She yours all night



[MARINES]

No one gives you a hit like the Engineer's shit!!



[Across the room, the ENGINEER speaks to KIM.]



[ENGINEER]

See little princess, I was right

You got the biggest score tonight

You caught that sergeant by the nose

You stay with him until he goes

Call him Chris

He'll like that



[KIM]

That marine

Wants his beer



[ENGINEER]

You said you needed a job

You said you'd turn a trick

You'd better prove it, and quick!



[He leads KIM to CHRIS]



[ENGINEER]

Voil
