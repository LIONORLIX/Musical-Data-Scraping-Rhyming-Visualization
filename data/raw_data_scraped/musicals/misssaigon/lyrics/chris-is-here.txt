Chris Is Here


CLUB OWNER

I thought I said, "no kids around"

so what's that brat doing here

you better take care, I'm watching both of you

you, and your Engineer

sir, would you like a massage?



JOHN

no thanks, it's not my scene



CLUB OWNER

you can find boys at La Cage



ENGINEER

where is he?

what is that look

he was right on the hook

don't tell me he slipped free



KIM

Engineer, Chris is here

John is going to get him

and bring him to me

my heart's ready to burst

I don't know what I'll tell him first



ENGINEER

that guy is no one to trust

or a soldier who's just learned he's fathered a son

you got to get to Chris first

I will find his address now

before he can run



KIM

you can trust what he'll do

don't you worry

I'll mention you



ENGINEER

don't screw with me little bitch

I don't want any hitch

you just do as you're told

you'll go to his hotel

I'll be working as well

guarding our bag of gold



KIM

tell me where, and I'll go

he is longing for me I know



you have brought me through the lightning

you have watched me from afar

you know all and you forgive me

loving parents that you are



ENGINEER

please, let your daughter have your blessing go on, talk to your ghosts, little girl

on the life that starts today 'til you're blue

we must journey to a new world you have one chance, just one

he's here

talking to you

and I must be on my way I'm on my way
