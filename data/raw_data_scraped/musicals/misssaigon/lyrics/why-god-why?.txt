Why God Why?


[KIM leads CHRIS out of the Club, and into a tiny cubicle,]

[which has in it only a bed, a table, and a small window overlooking]

[the moonlit city. Later in the night, CHRIS is dressed and]

[standing at the window. KIM is asleep. Outside, Saigon still bustles.]



[CHRIS]

Why does Saigon never sleep at night?

Why does this girl smell of orange trees?

How can I feel good when nothing's right?

Why is she cool when there is no breeze?

Vietnam

You don't give answers, do you friend?

Just questions that don't ever end

Why God? Why today?

I'm all through here, on my way

There's nothing left here that I'll miss

Why send me now a night like this?

Who is the girl in this rusty bed?

Why am I back in a filthy room?

Why is her voice ringing in my head?

Why am I high on her cheap perfume?

Vietnam

Hey look I mean you no offense

But why does nothing here make sense?

Why God? Show your hand

Why can't one guy understand?

I've been with girls who knew much more

I never felt confused before

Why me? What's your plan?

I can't help her, no one can

I liked my mem'ries as they were

But now I'll leave rememb'ring her



[CHRIS leaves some money on a table and goes out into the street.]

[CHRIS is accosted by Vietnamese who beg for help leaving the country.]

[He pushes them.]



When I went home before

No one talked of the war

What they knew from TV

Didn't have a thing to do with me

I went back and re-upped

Sure Saigon is corrupt

It felt better to be

Here driving for the embassy

'Cause here if you can pull a string

A guy like me lives like a king

Just as long as you don't believe anything



[CHRIS stops, then goes back into KIM'S room.]



Why God? Why this face?

Why such beauty in this place?

I liked my mem'ries as they were

But now I'll leave rememb'ring her

Just her
