Those You've Known


MORITZ

Those you’ve known

And lost, still walk behind you

All alone

They linger till they find you



Without them

The world grows dark around you

And nothing is the same until you know that they have found you



WENDLA

Those you’ve pained

May carry that still with them

All the same

They whisper:All forgiven.’



Still your heart says

The shadows bring the starlight

And everything you’ve ever been is still there in the dark night



WENDLA

When the northern wind blows

The sorrows your heart holds

There are those who still know

They’re still home

We’re still home



MORITZ (Sung In Counterpart)

Though you know

You’ve left them far behind

You walk on by yourself, and not with them



Still you know

They will fill your heart and mind

When they say there’s a way through this



MELCHIOR, MORITZ AND WENDLA

Those you’ve known

And lost, still walk behind you

All alone

Their song still seems to find you



They call you

As if you knew their longing

They whistle through the lonely wind, the long blue shadows falling



MELCHIOR

All alone

But still I hear their yearning

Through the dark, the moon, alone there, burning



The stars too

They tell of spring returning

And summer with another wind that no one yet has known



(MORITZ and WENDLA Join with Counterparts)



They call me

Through all things

Night’s falling

But somehow I go on



You watch me

Just watch me

I’m calling

From longing



WENDLA (Sung in Counterpart)

When the northern wind blows

The sorrows your heart’s known

I believe’



MORITZ (Sung in Counterpart)

Still you known

There’s so much more to find

Another dream, another love you’ll hold



Still you know

To trust your own true mind

On your way you are not alone

There are those who still know



MELCHIOR (Sung Alone)

Now they’ll walk on my arm through the distant night

And I won’t let them stray from my heart

Through the wind, through the dark, through the winter light

I will read all their dreams to the stars



I'll walk now with them

I’ll call on their names

I’ll see their thoughts are known



WENDLA

Not gone

Not gone



MELCHIOR

They walk with my heart

And I'll never let them go



I’ll never let them go

I’ll never let them go

You watch me

Just watch me

I’m calling

I’m calling

And one day all will know
