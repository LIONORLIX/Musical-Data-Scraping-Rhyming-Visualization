There Once Was a Pirate


There once was a pirate

Who put out to sea

His mates all around him

No maiden on his knee

Oh sail for a little

A little little litte

Oh sail for a little

Til she finds him



There once was a maiden

Who wandered the mead

To gather blue violets

Her mama would need

A wail through the willows

All hollow through the willows

She’ll wail through the willows

‘Til she finds him



The sea was so violent

The crew went below

They begged him to join them

But he would not go

Oh sail a little little

For just a little little

Oh sail for a little

‘Til she finds him



Her heart was so laden

She fell by a tree

Sang of some pirate

Who haunted the sea

A wail through the willows

All hollow through the willows

She’ll wail through the willows

‘Til she finds him



A wail through the willows

(sail for a little)

All hollow through the willows

(the willow willows)

She’ll wail through the willows

(sail for a little)

‘Til she finds him



He’ll sail for a little

A little little litte

He’ll sail for a little

‘Til she finds him



He’ll sail for a little ‘til she finds him
