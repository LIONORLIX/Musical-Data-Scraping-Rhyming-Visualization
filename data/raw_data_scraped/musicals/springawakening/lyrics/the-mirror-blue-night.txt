The Mirror-Blue Night


BOYS

Flip on a switch, and everything’s fine ?

No more lips, no more tongue, no more ears, no more eyes

The naked blue angel, who peers through the blinds

Disappears in the gloom of the mirror-blue night



MELCHIOR

But there’s nowhere to hide from these bones, from my mind

It’s broken inside. I’m a man and a child

I’m at home with a ghost, who got left in the cold

Who knocks at my peace, with no keys to my soul



BOYS

And the whispers of fear, the chill up the spine

Will steal away too, with a flick of the light

The minute you do it, with fingers so blind

You remove every bit of the blue from your mind



MELCHIOR

But there’s nowhere to hide from the ghost in my mind

It’s cold in these bones of a man and a child

And there’s no one who knows, and there’s nowhere to go

There’s no one to see who can see to my soul
