Mamma Who Bore Me


[WENDLA]



Mama who bore me

Mama who gave me

No way to handle things

Who made me so sad



Mama, the weeping

Mama, the angels

No sleep in Heaven, or Bethlehem



Some pray that one day

Christ will come a'-callin'

They light a candle

And hope that it glows

And some just lie there

Crying for him to come and find them

But when he comes they don't know how to go



Mama who bore me

Mama who gave me

No way to handle things

Who made me so bad



Mama, the weeping

Mama, the angels

No sleep in Heaven, or Bethlehem
