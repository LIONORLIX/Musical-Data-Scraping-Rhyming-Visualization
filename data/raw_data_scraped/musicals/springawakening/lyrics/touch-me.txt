Touch Me


Melchior:

Where I go, when i go there,

No more memory anymore-

Only men on distant ships,

The women with them, swimming with them, to shore...



Moritz:

Where I go, when I go there,

No more whispering anymore-

Only hymns upon your lips;

A mystic wisdom, rising with them, to shore...



Ernst:

Touch me-just like that.

And that-oh, yeah-now, that's heaven.

Now, that I like.

God that's so nice.

Now lower down, where the figs lie...



Moritz: (Spoken)

Still, you must admit, with the two anatomies, it truly is daunting.

I mean how everything might..



Melchior: (Spoken)

Measure up?



Moritz: (Spoken)

Not that I'm saying I wouldn't...I wouldn't want to not...would ever not want to...



Melchior: (Spoken)

Moritz?



Moritz: (Spoken)

I have to go.



Melchior: (Spoken)

Moritz, wait.



Otto:

Where I go when I go there,

No more shadows anymore-

Only men with golden fins;

The rythm in them, rocking with them, to shore...



Georg:

Where I go when I go there,

No more weeping anymore.

Only in and out your lips;

the broken wishes, washing with them, to shore.



All:

Touch me-all silent.

Tell me-please-all is forgiven.

Consume my wine.

Consume my mind.

I'll tell you how, how the winds sigh...



Touch me-just try it.

Now there-that's it-God that's heaven.

Touch me.

I'll love your light.

I'll love you right...

We'll wander down, where the sins lie...



Touch me-just like that.

Now lower down, where the sins lie...



Love me-just for bit...

We'll wander down, where the winds sigh...

Where the winds sigh...

Where the winds sigh...
