Don't Do Sadness / Blue Wind


[Moritz]

Awful sweet to be a little butterfly

Just winging over things

And nothing deep inside.

Nothing going going wild in you,

You know,

You're slowing by the riverside

Or floating high and blue.

Or maybe cool

To be a little summer wind

Like once through everything

And then away again.

With the taste of dust

In your mouth all day

But no need to know

Like sadness

You just sail away.



Cause you know,

I don't do sadness

Not even a little bit.

Just don't need it in my life

Don't want any part of it.

I don't do sadness,

Hey i've done my time

Looking back on it all

Then it blows my mind,

I don't do sadness

So been there.

Don't do sadness

Just don't care.



Spoken:



[isle]

Moritz stiefle?



[moritz]

Ilse’ You frightened me.



[ilse]

What are you looking for?



[moritz]

If only i knew.



[ilse]

Then what's the use of looking?

I'm on the way home. Want to come?



[moritz]

I don't know.



[ilse]

God, you remember how we used to run back to my house and play pirates?

Vend le bergman, wendla bergmen, melchior gabor, you, and i?



Sung:

[ilse]

Spring and summer ev’ry other day

Blue wind gets so sad

Blowin’ Through the thick corn,

Through the bales of hay,

Through the open books on the grass

Spring and summer.



Sure, when it’s autumn

Wind always wants to

Creep up and haunt you

Whistlin? It’s got you

With its heartache, with its sorrow

Winter wind sings and it cries.



Spring and summer ev’ry other day

Blue wind gets so pained

Blowin’ Through the thick corn,

Through the bales of hay,

Through the sudden drift of the rain

Spring and summer.



Spoken:

[moritz]

Actually, i'd better go.



[ilse]

Walk as far as my house with me.



[moritz]

I wish i could.



[ilse]

Then why don't you?



[moritz]

80 lines of virgil, 16 equations, a paper on the hapsburgs.



Sung:

[moritz]

So maybe

I should be some kind of laundry line.

Hang their things on me

And i will swing 'em dry.

You're just wavin' the sun

Through the afternoon

And then see

They come to set you free

Beneath the rising moon



Sung in counterpart:

[moritz]

Cause you know,

I don't do sadness

Not even a little bit.

Just don't need it in my life

Don't want any part of it.

I don't do sadness,

Hey i've done my time

Looking back on it all

Then it blows my mind.

I don't do sadness

So been there,

Don't do sadness

Just don't care.



[ilse]

Spring and summer ev’ry other day

Blue wind gets so lost

Blowin’ Through the thick corn,

Through the bales of hay



Spring and summer ev’ry other day

Blue wind gets so lost

Blowin’ Through the thick corn,

Through the bales of hay,

Through the wandering clouds of the dust

Spring and summer
