All That's Known


All that's known

In History, in Science

Overthrown

At school, at home, by blind men



You doubt them

And soon they bark and hound you-

Till everything you say is just another bad about you



All they say

Is "Trust in What is Written"

Wars are made

And somehow that is wisdom



Thought is suspect

And money is their idol

And nothing is okay unless it's scripted in their Bible



But I know

There's so much more to find-

Just in looking through myself

And not at them



Still, I know

To trust my own true mind

And to say: there's a way through this



On I go

To wonder and to learning

Name the stars and know their dark returning



I'm calling

To know the world's true yearning-

The hunger that a child feels for everything they're shown



You watch me-

Just watch me-

I'm calling

And one day all will know



You watch me-

Just watch me-

I'm calling, I'm calling.

And one day all will know
