Whispering


WENDLA



Whispering

Here the ghosts in the moonlight

Sorrow doing a new dance

Through their bone, through their skin



Listening

To the souls in the fool's night

Fumbling mutely with their rude hands

And there's heartache without end



See the father bent in grief

The mother dressed in mourning

Sister crumbles, and the neighbors grumble

The preacher issues warnings



History

Little miss didn't do right

Went and ruined all the true plans

Such a shame. Such a sin.



Mystery

Home alone on a school night

Harvest moon over the blue land

Summer longing on the wind



Had a sweetheart on his knees

So faithful and adoring

And he touched me. And I let him love me.

So let that be my story



Listening

For the hope, for the new life

Something beautiful, a new chance

Hear its whispering

There again
