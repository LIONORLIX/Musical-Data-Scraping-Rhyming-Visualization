The Song of Purple Summer


And all shall fade

The flowers of spring

The world and all the sorrows

At the heart of everything



But still it stays

The butterfly sings

And opens purple summer

With a flutter of its wings



The earth will wave with corn

The grey-fly choir will mourn

And mare will neigh

With stallions that they mate

Foals they've born



And all shall know the wonder of purple summer.....



And yet i wait

The swallow brings

A song too hard to follow

That no one else can sing



The fences sway

The porches swing

The clouds begin to thunder

Crickets wander murmuring



The earth will wave with corn

The grey-fly choir will mourn

And mares with neigh

With stallions that they mate

Foals they've born



And all shall know the wonder

I will sing the song of purple summer.



And all shall know the wonder

I will sing the song of purple summer.



All shall know the wonder of purple summer.....
