The Guilty Ones


WENDLA

Something’s started crazy

Sweet and unknown



Something you keep

In a box on the street

Now it’s longing for a home



ALL

And who can say what dreams are?



WENDLA

Wake me in time to be lonely and sad



ALL

And who can say what we are?



WENDLA

This is the season for dreaming



And now our bodies are the guilty ones

Who touch

And color the hours



Night won’t breathe

Oh how we

Fall into silence from the sky



And whisper some silver reply



MELCHIOR

Pulse is gone and racing

All fits and starts



Window by window

You try and look into

This brave new you that you are



ALL

And who can say what dreams are?



MELCHIOR & WENDLA

Wake me in time to be out in the cold



ALL

And who can say what we are?



MELCHIOR & WENDLA

This is the reason for dreaming



ALL

And now our bodies are the guilty ones

Our touch

Will fill every hour



Huge and dark

Oh our hearts

Will murmur the blues from on high



Then whisper some silver reply



And now our bodies are the guilty ones

Our touch

Will color hours



Night won’t breathe

Oh how we

Fall in silence from the sky



Then whisper some silver reply
