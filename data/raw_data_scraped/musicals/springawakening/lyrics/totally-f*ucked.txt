Totally F*ucked


MELCHIOR

There’s a moment you know you’re fucked

Not an inch more room to self-destruct

No more moves

oh yeah, the dead-end zone

Man, you just can’t call your soul your own



OTTO (Spoken)

But the thing that makes you really jump

Is that the weirdest shit is still to come

You can ask yourself: ‘Hey, what have I done’?

You’re just a fly ? the little guys, they kill for fun



GEORG

Man, you’re fucked if you just freeze up

Can’t do that thing that keeping still



HANSCHEN

But, you’re fucked if you speak your mind



GEORG, HANSECHEN & OTTO

And you know uh huh you will



ALL

Yeah, you’re fucked all right and all for spite

You can kiss your sorry ass goodbye

Totally fucked will they mess you up?

Well you know they’re gonna try



MELCHIOR (Spoken)

Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah



ALL (Spoken)

Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah



MELCHIOR

Disappear yeah, well, you wanna try

Wanna bundle up into some big ass lie

Long enough for them to all just quit

Long enough for you to get out of it



ALL

Yeah, you’re fucked all right and all for spite

You can kiss your sorry ass goodbye

Totally fucked will they mess you up

Well you know they’re gonna try



Yeah, you’re fucked all right and all for spite

You can kiss your sorry ass goodbye

Totally fucked will they mess you up?

Well you know they’re gonna try



Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah

Blah blah blah blah blah

Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah

Blah blah blah blah blah

Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah

Blah blah blah blah blah

Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah

Blah blah blah blah blah
