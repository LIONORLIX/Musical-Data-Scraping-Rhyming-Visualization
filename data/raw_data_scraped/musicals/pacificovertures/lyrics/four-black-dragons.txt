Four Black Dragons


FISHERMAN

I was standing on the beach

Near the cliffs

At Oshama.

I was spreading out the nets

For the morning sun.

It was early in July

And the day was getting hot,

And I stopped to wipe my eyes,

And by accident I turned

And looked out to sea ...



And there came,

Breaking through the mist,

Roaring through the sea,

Four black dragons,

Spitting fire.

And I ran,

Cursing through the fields,

Calling the alarm,

Shouting to the world,

"Four black dragons,

Spitting fire!"

And the earth trembled,

And the sky cracked,

And I thought it was the end of the world.



THIEF

I was rifling through the house,

Of some priests

In Uraga.

It was only after dawn,

They were sleeping still.

I had finished with the silks,

I was hunting for the gold,

When I heard them getting up,

So I bolted through a door

Which looked out to sea ...



FISHERMAN

And there came ...



THIEF

And there came ...



FISHERMAN

Breaking through the mist ...



THIEF

Boiling through the mist ...



FISHERMAN

Roaring through the sea ...



THIEF

Rising from the sea ?



FISHERMAN

Four black dragons ?



THIEF

Four volcanoes ?



FISHERMAN

Spitting fire ?



THIEF

Spitting fire!

And I ran ?



FISHERMAN

And I ran ?



THIEF

Cursing down the halls ?



FISHERMAN

Cursing through the fields ?



THIEF

Shouting to the priests ?



FISHERMAN

Shouting to the world ?



BOTH

"Notify the gods!

Four black dragons,

Spitting fire!"



RECITER

And the feet pattered

And the men came down to stare,

And the women started screaming

Like the gulls.

Hai! Hai!

And the crowded into temples

And they flapped about the square ?

Hai! ?

Like the gulls.

Hai!



TOWNSPEOPLE

Hai! Hai!

Four black dragons,

Spitting fire!



RECITER

Then the hooves clattered

And the warriors were there,

Diving quickly through the panic

Like the gulls.

Hai! Hai!

And the swords were things of beauty

As they glided through the air ?

Hai!

Like the gulls.

Hai!



TOWNSPEOPLE

Hai! Hai!

Four black dragons,

Spitting fire!



THIEF and COMPANY FISHERMAN

And the sun darkened I had seen

And the sea bubbled, Dragons before,

And the earth trembled, Never so many,

And the sky cracked, Never like these,

And I thought it was the end And I thought it was the end

Of the world! Of the world!



RECITER

And it was.
