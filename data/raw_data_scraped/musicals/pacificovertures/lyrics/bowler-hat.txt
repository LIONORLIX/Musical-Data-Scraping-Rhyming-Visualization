Bowler Hat


KAYAMA

(picking up a derby)

It's called a bowler hat.

I have no wife.

The swallow flying through the sky

Is not as swift as I

Am, flying through my life.

You pour the milk before the tea.

The Dutch ambassador is no fool.

I must remember that.





I wear a bowler hat.

They send me wine.

The house is far too grand.

I've bought a new umbrella stand.

Today I visited the church beside the shrine.

I'm learning English from a book.

Most exciting.

It's called a bowler hat.





(bringing out a watch)

It's called a pocket watch.

I have a wife.

No eagle flies against the sky

As eagerly as I

Have flown against my life.

One smokes American cigars.

The Dutch ambassador was most rude.

I will remember that.





I wind my pocket watch.

We serve white wine.

The house is far too small.

I killed a spider on the wall.

One of the servants thought it was a lucky sign.

I read Spinoza every day.

Formidable.

Where is my bowler hat?





(putting a monocle to his eye)

It's called a monocle.

I've left my wife.

No bird exploring in the sky

Explores as well as I

The corners of my life.

One must keep moving with the times.

The Dutch ambassador is a fool.

He wears a bowler hat.





(putting on a pair of glasses)

They call them spectacles.

I drink much wine.

I take imported pills

I have a house up in the hills

I've hired British architects to redesign.

One must accomodate the times

As one lives them.

One must remember that.





(holding up a tailcoat)

It's called a cutaway ?
