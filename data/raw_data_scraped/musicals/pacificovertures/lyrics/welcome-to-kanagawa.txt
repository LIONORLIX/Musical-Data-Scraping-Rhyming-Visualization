Welcome to Kanagawa


MADAM

I own a small commercial venture

With a modest clientele

In Kanagawa.



GIRLS

I think I see one over there behind the trees!



MADAM

Sh!

(to the audience)

It's been my family's for centur-

Ies and doing very well ?

For Kanagawa.



GIRLS

I hear they're covered all with hair, like some disease.



MADAM

Sh!



FOURTH GIRL

Except their knees.



MADAM

Sh!

(to audience)

The arrival of these giants

Out of the blue,

Bringing panic to my clients,

Alters my view.

With so many of them fleeing,

Conferring, decreeing,

I find myself agreeing

With the ancient haiku:



RECITER

The nest-building bird,

Seeking the tree without twigs,

Looks for new forests.



MADAM

Exactly.

(As a "forest" forms on the stage, she and the girls search for Americans.)

Welcome to Kanagawa.



GIRLS

Welcome to Kanagawa!



MADAM

No ?

Welcome to Kanagawa.



GIRLS

Oh ?

Welcome to Kanagawa.



MADAM

So ?

With all my flowers disappearing

In alarm,

I've been reduced to commandeering

From the farm.

But with appropriate veneering,

Even green wood has its charm.



GIRLS

(searching)

Yo-ho!

Yo-ho!



MADAM

(beckoning them)

Yo-ho!

(She hands out pornographic fans to the girls and points to each in turn.)

That you'll have to bend for ?

Can yo see why?



FIRST GIRL

Yo-ho!



MADAM

That you'll need a friend for ?

Still, you might try.



SECOND GIRL

Yo-ho!



MADAM

That you do through the kimono ?

Not very much.



THIRD GIRL

Yo-ho!



MADAM

That you use glue, then you ?

No, no, no, no,

Those you don't touch!



ALL

Welcome to Kanagawa,

Music and food for twenty yen ?

Music and food ?



MADAM

And maybe then ?



ALL

Welcome!



Welcome to Kanagawa!

Music and food and company!

Music and food ?



MADAM

? And for a fee ?



ALL

Welcome!



MADAM

(to the audience)

When a country is in trouble,

Choices are few.

And apart from charging double,

What can you do?

With my clients off defending,

And strangers descending,

I find myself depending

On the ancient haiku:



RECITER

The bird from the sea,

Not knowing pine from bamboo,

Roosts on anything.



MADAM

Exactly.



GIRLS

Welcome to Kanagawa!



MADAM

Glow!



GIRLS

Welcome to Kanagawa!



MADAM

Low!



GIRLS

Welcome to Kanagawa!



MADAM

Grow!



GIRLS

Welcome to Kanagawa!



MADAM

Go!



(as they all move into the "forest")

GIRLS

Yo-ho!

Yo-ho!



MADAM

Yo-ho! ?

Yo-ho!
