There Is No Other Way


FIRST OBSERVER

The eye sees, the thought flies.

The eye tells, the thought denies.



SECOND OBSERVER

I will prepare for your returning.

(Is there no other way?)



FIRST OBSERVER

The word falls, the heart cries.

The heart knows the world's disguise.



SECOND OBSERVER

I shall expect you then at evening.

(Is there no other way?)



FIRST OBSERVER

The bird sings, the wind sighs,

The air stirs, the bird shies.

A storm approaches.



SECOND OBSERVER

(There must be other ways ...)



FIRST OBSERVER

The leaf shakes, the wings rise.

The song stops, the bird flies.

The storm approaches.



SECOND OBSERVER

I will have supper waiting.



FIRST OBSERVER

The song stops, the bird flies,

The mind stirs, the heart replies,

"There is no other way."



SECOND OBSERVER

I will prepare for your return.

I shall expect you then at evening.



FIRST OBSERVER

The word stops, the heart dies.

The wind counts the lost goodbyes.



SECOND OBSERVER

There is no other way.

There is no other way.
