What's Your Rush?


[[Dance Hall Girl]]

What's your rush?

Too bad you're in such a rush--

Honey,

Stick around,

Relax and get warm.



What's out there?

A lot of lousy weather.

What's in here?

A chance for you and me to be together...



Celebrate.

Believe me, kid, the gold will wait.

I won't.

Getting late,

And listen to that storm...



What's out there?

Snow and slush.

If you're so determined, though,

Mush, boy, mush.

Otherwise--



Ooh, those eyes--

I mean, what's your rush?



My name's Nellie.



[[Wilson]]

Willie.



[[Nellie]]

I like that. You new to these parts, Willie?



[[Wilson]]

Uh-huh. And you?



[[Nellie]]

I've been here long enough to learn a thing or two.



[[Wilson]]

Like what?



[[Nellie]]

Like when something good comes by, you grab it.

Because up here, good things have a habit of not coming

by...



When you're through,

There's lots of things I'd like to do--

Bad things.

Maybe you

Could help me to reform.



I could get

Such a crush...

What's the matter, baby?

Is that a blush?

Trust me, hon...

Just for fun...

Come on, what's your rush?
