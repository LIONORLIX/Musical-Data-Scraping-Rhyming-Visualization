The Game


[[Wilson]]

One day lose, the next day win--

Nothing goes as planned.

When you feel like giving in,

Comes a brand new hand.



What you've lost, that's where you've been.

Long as you keep moving,

Things will keep improving--

Prospects will expand.

Okay, Papa, now I understand.



It's more than just the money, it's

The thing that really matters is the game.

That moment when the card is dealt,

And nothing is the same--

The only thing that matters is the game.



Better than sex, better than booze,

Beating ace high with a pair of twos.

Better to win, but if you lose,

You've had your moment.



It's more than just the money that's at stake.

That's nice, but it's just icing on the cake.

It's your life, every pot,

Who you are, not what you've got.

Without the risk, the world seems pretty tame.

The thing that really matters is the game.



[[Addison]]

But, Willie, we could lose everything.



[[Wilson]]

Addie, take the chance

Or it disappears!

Every card you're dealt opens new frontiers--

Let's be pioneers!



The whole thing's nothing more than just a game.

And, Addie, what i'm good at is the game.

They thought they'd found a sucker,

But in time the sucker's learned,

Now look--

--who's burned?



And anyway, when all is said and done,

The fun is in the winning, not what's won.

What you've made, what you've spent,

Those are not  the main even.

With every hand you stake a whole new claim--

The only thing that matters is the game.
