I Love This Town


[[Addison]]

Outside modest, inside grand,

Fit for millionaires.

Willie's wish is my command.

...where to put the stairs?...

On my way, the way I planned--

Still, though, who could plan it?

...travertine, not granite...

Willie's got a wife--

Even better, Willie's got a life.



[[WIlson]]

You are the best thing that ever has happened

to me,

You are...



[[Nellie]]

And...?



[[Wilson]]

Just you're the best thing that ever has happened

to me,

You are...



[[Nellie]]

Right.



[[WIlson]]

Kid!



[[Ketchel]]

Just great!



[[Nellie]]

Who's that?!



[[Wilson]]

Stanley Ketchel, fighting Sailor Boy

Mackenzie for the title.



[[Nellie]]

For the title?



[[Wilson]]

For the middleweight crown.

We bought his contract

For a measly fifty thousand.



[[Nellie]]

We did?



[[Wilson]]

Looking thick around the middle, kid.

Behaving yourself?



[[Ketchel]]

Meet the Sailor--



[[Wilson]]

Hey.



[[Ketchel]]

Willie gets me fights--

Willie gets me dope--

Willie gets me broads--

Say hello to Myrna.



[[Myrna]]

Hi...



[[Wilson]]

The winner and new middleweight champion of

the world--Stanley Ketchel!



God, I love this town!

Don't you love this town?

It's got all of these

Opportunities.

Can't afford to turn them down.

Some may not work out.

Some go up the spout,

Plenty more around the corner--

And what's 'round the corner, sweetheart,

That's what life's about.



You are the sexiest thing that has happened to me,

You are.



[[Nellie]]

You are the best thing that still hasn't happened

to me,

You are...

Who's that?



[[WIlson]]

Paul Armstrong, Broadway's leading playwright.

We're producing his new play.



[[Nellie]]

We are--?



[[Armstrong]]

And let me just say that I could not have achieved

this soul-sering portrait of the New York underworld

without my good friend Wilson Mizner!



[[Chorines and Armstrong]]

Broadway Willie,

Prince of bon vivants--

Everybody wants

Broadway Willie Mizner!

Knocks 'em silly,

Lowlifes and Duponts,

Cops and debutantes--



[[Ketchel]]

Hiya, Willie.



[[WIlson]]

Hiya, champ.



[[Ketchel]]

Say hello to Willie.



[[Callahan]]

Hey.



[[Ketchel]]

Willie gets me fights--

Willie gets me dope--

Willie gets me broads--

Say hello to Lulu--

Myrna?



[[Myrna]]

You sonofabitch, you'll never two-time me again!



[[Reporter #1]]

Any comment, Mr. Mizner,

On this terrible event?



[[Reporter #2]]

Anything you want to say

About the shooting of the champ?



[[Wilson]]

Try counting ten over him; maybe he'll get up.



[[Reporter #1]]

Nice comeback.



[[Reporter #2]]

Smart fella.



[[Reporters and Photographer]]

Good copy!



[[Nellie]]

Hey, Willie--



[[Wilson]]

God, I love this town!     [[Others]]

Don't you love this         Broadway Willie,

town?

It's got all of these         Prince of bon vivants,

Opportunities!               Everybody wants--

Mustn't turn them          --Broadway Willie Mizner!

down!



Papa said explore

Knocks 'em silly,

Papa knew the score.

Lowlifes and Duponts--



[[Wilson]]

God, I love it here!

Don't you love it here?   [[Reporters and Photographers]]



[[Others]]

Every place you look      Broadway Willie            Nightclub fillies,

is the king of

the street,

Is an open book             Broadway Willie            Bluebloods

never misses                racketeers,

a beat,

Every street a new         Everybody in New         Everybody cheers

frontier!                        York wants to meet

Good Time Willie           Good Time Willie

Mizner!                         Mizner!



[[All except Nellie]]

Things may not work out,

Things go up the spout,

Plenty more around the corner,

And what's waiting 'round the corner,

Isn't that what life is all about?



[WIlson]]

God, I love your face!



[[Others]]

Ziegfield Liles--



[[Wilson]]

And I love this place!



[[Others]]

Financiers--



[[Chorines]]

Willie gets them hot--



[[Callahan, Policeman, and Gamblers]]

Willie gets them pot--



[[Armstrong, Ketchel, and Jockey]]

Willie gets them shot--



[[Nellie]]

Willie gets me not--



[[All]]

What has Willie got

That makes him King of New York?

Broadway Willie! Broadway Willie!

Broadway Willie!



[[Wilson]]

God, I love this town!
