Bounce (Part 1)


[[Wilson]]

We've come a long way.



[[Addison]]

We've been through a lot.



[[Wilson]]

We've learned how to bounce.

As Papa would say:



[[Both]]

"You're hot, then you're not,

You better learn to bounce."



If something goes wrong,

That's all right.

Bounce along,

Just travel light.

You go off the track,

Don't look back,

That's the thing that counts.



[[Addison]]

You hit a few bumps,

You make a few gaffes,

You learn how to bounce.



[[Wilson]]

You take a few lumps,

You have a few laughs,

And all the while you bounce.



[[Both]

Don't dwell on the times

That you fail,

Remember the times

When you said.

Find a new road--

Forge a new trail--

Bounce.



[[Wilson]]

You don't suppose this is really Heaven, do you?



[[Addison]]

If guys like you get to go to Heave, Willie, who has

to go to Hell?



[[Wilson]]

Point taken--Although if this isn't Heaven, then

where the hell are we?



[[Addison]]

Yeah. And where do we go next?



[[Wilson]]

No cause for concern,

We'll get by,

Live and learn--

All right then, die.

So what if we're dead?

Gotta look ahead!



[[Addison]]

How true, how true.



[[Wilson]]

The road may get rough--



[[Wilson]]

Be ready to bounce.



[[Addison]]

You needn't have brilliance,

Just resilience.



[[Wilson]]

You do it enough--

You look for the chance,



[[Both]]

You see it and you pounce.



[[Wilson]]

When you're spent, Reinvent.



[[Both]]

We've bucked a few trends--



[[Wilson]]

And with style.



[[Both]]

We made a few friends--



[[Addison]]

For a while.



[[Wilson]]

From all we've been through--



[[Addison]]

From dealing with you,

I've learned how to --



Goddamn it, Willie! Would you put that crap away?!



[[Wilson]]

The time up in the Nome,

God up to our ears--!



[[Addison]]

We lost every ounce.



[[Wilson]]

Come on, it was fun--



[[Addison]]

At the point of a gun?!



[[Wilson]]

Well, then we get home

And who disappears?



[[Addison]]

I had to learn to bounce.



[[Wilson]]

But we were a team.



[[Addison]]

No, you were a team.



[[Wison]]

The horse that we doped--



[[Addison]]

That you doped.



[[Wilson]]

Just trying to help further your career.



[[Addison]]

When you were finished helping, I didn't have

a career.



[[Wilson]]

It's the thought that counts.

No, you're right, you're right,

And when you are right, you're right!



[[Addison]]

And of course there was that time down in Florida:

you skipped town, left me holding the bag.



[[Wilson]]

Sort of like that time up in New York, when you

skipped town and left me for dead.



[[Addison]]

New York? You want to talk about New York--?!



[[Wilson]]

You're stuck in a jam,

Your brother says, "Scram!"

You pack up and--



[[Addison]]

"Scram," yes, indeed. "Scram," as in

"Scram, sucker, I'm getting married. I'll get back to you--"



The brother you prize

Keeps telling you lies,

You better goddamn well know how to goddamn--!

Oh goddamn you!



[[Wilson]]

I mean, here we are,

Team or not.

It's bizarre

How far we've got.

Together again,

Two old men

Settling our accounts.



[[Addison]]

You're right, and when you're right,

Which isn't too often--



[[Wilson]]

The problem was mine.



[[Addison]]

All I did was whine.



[[Wilson]]

You did sort of flounce--

With justification.



[[Addison]]

Just frustration.



[[Wilson]]

No, I was a fink.



[[Addison]]

I drove you to drink.



[[Wilson]]

What saved us was our bounce.



[[Addison]]

That's how you survive.



[[Wilson]]

We just might come out of this whole thing alive.



[[Both]]

With someone to give

You a hand,

You not only live,

You expand.

You learn to adjust.

You do what you must:



Bounce.
