Next To You


[[Addison]]

Alaska, Mama, you would've loved it

The Aurora Borealis is a sight

To behold.

When the moon is out,

The world becomes a fairyland of white,

Blue and gold...



[[Wilson]]

The Aurora Borealis is a bust,

Next to you,

Every bad of gold is nothing more

Than just a bag of dust,

Next to you...



[[Addison]]

Every moment I was digging,

Frozen to the bone--

Digging all alone--

All that I could do

Was think of being next--



[[Wilson]]

Next to you,

Moonlight on the snow was unexciting.

Next to you,

The moon is just an accident of lighting.



[[Addison]]

Every moment

I was lonely,

What's the only

Thing that saw me through?



[[Wilson]]

How spiffy could a moon be--?



[[Addison]]

Knowing I'd soon be--



[[Both]]

--next to you.



[[Mama]]

Who needs gold?

Who needs moonlight?

Addie is my fold.

Willie, you're my moonlight.

How could any mother--

Any woman--

Ask for more

Than my two young men?



My two young men--

One to make me smile,

One to keep me honest.



My two white knights,

My two adventurers,

My two great rascals--



One who's razor-smart,

One who's warm as wool,

One to lift my heart,

One to make it full.



My two young men --

One to keep me drunk with laughter,

One to keep me sober after,

One who's

Reprehensible,

Indispensable,

One who's sensible--

Both of whom I love and adore.

I don't know which one I love more.



[[Wilson]]

Next to you--



[[Addison]]

Nest to my best girl--



[[Wilson]]

The Aurora Borealis is a bust--



[[Addison]]

The Aurora Borealis is a bust--



[[Wilson]]

Next to you--



[[Addison]]

Next to my best girl--



[[Wilson]]

--a bag of gold is nothing but a bag of dust.



[[Addison]]

--a bag of gold is nothing--



[[Wilson]]

I said that--!



[[Addison]]

Not the bright glow

of the moon--



[[Wilson]]

Not the mellow glow of a spittoon--



[[Mama]]

Oh, Wilson...



[[Addison]]

I will make a home for you--



[[Wilson]]

I will take you dancing.



[[Addison]]

I will come and live with you--



[[Wilson]]

I'll leave you alone--



[[Mama]]

My two young men...



[[Addison]]

Anything you want--



[[Wilson]]

Anything you want!



[[Addison]]

Tell me what you want!



[[Mama]]

...one to make me melt,

One to make me giggle,

Two to live the life your mama

Wished she could have had before.

Go, lads,

Send me back dispatches from the war.

I don't know which one I love more.
