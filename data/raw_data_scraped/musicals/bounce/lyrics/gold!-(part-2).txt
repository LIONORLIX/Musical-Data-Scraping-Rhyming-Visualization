Gold! (Part 2)


[[Poker Players]]

Gold!



[[Poker Player #1]]

Got us a beginner, boys--



[[Poker Players]]

Gold!



[[Poker Player #1]]

--fresh off the ground.



[[Poker Players]]

Gold! Gold!



[[Poker Player #1]]

This one is a winner, boys--



[[Poker Player #3]]

Pluck it from a mountain

Or pluck it form a hick--



[[Poker Player #2]]

When you see a chance, you pluck it

Off of someone who has struck it--



[[Poker Player #3]]

You don't have to have a bucket

Or a shovel or a pick--



[[Poker Player #4]]

All you really need is luck or

An accommodating sucker

Who imagines that he's slick--



[[All four]]

--and who doesn't know he's thick--



[[Poker Player #1]]

And it sounds like you've had some luck out there,

friend. I don't suppose you'd care to try your luck

in here?



[[Wilson]]

You mean cards? No, no thanks. My brother's

waiting for me.



[Thanks to Michael for lyrics]
