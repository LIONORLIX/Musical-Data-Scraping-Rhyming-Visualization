Love Will Come and Find Me Again Lyrics




Once upon a time, I would wake beside a man,

Who would make me feel like nothing could take him from me

Once I thought forever was real,

I thought my life was ideal,

I though that nothing could steal it, you see



Once I learned how wrong I had been,

That sometimes dreams can cave in and what then?

Once I learned the hard way,

Faith in ever after was done,

And I gave up ever wondering when,

Love will come and find me again



And it's almost like time has stood still,

Like a lifetime iced under a frost,

And I don't try to warm from the chill,

Although I know how much I've lost,



Trouble is, the more you deny,

The more you don't even try,

The more the world passes by in a haze,

Soon you find you don't even know how many years you let go,

The chances wasted in so many ways,



Lately I've been thinking it's time

To take a look at what I'm doing then, clinging to if only,

Heaven knows there's more than one man

And maybe I should be planning for when,

Love will come and find me again,



Letting go of what might have been,

And letting something else in only then,

Love will come and find me again.
