Who I Was


You know what I want even more

Is to be just who I was before



Self-assured, future all secured

That was Julia

Quick to trust, saw the world as just

That was Julia



Full of promise and full of poise

Hardly any of which this shop girl now employs

But I muddle through...



Easy smile, avid cinephile

That was Julia

That was Julia

Before being branded a gold star wife

A distinction that's redefining my whole life



Well, it feels like it does

I feel guilty because

There are days when I just want to be who I was



I'm not saying I'd trade the life that I had with him for a minute

That was once in a lifetime love and I know I was lucky to win it



And I'm told to be proud

All the newsreels and magazines practically shout it

But I'm never allowed

To admit there is nothing remotely heroic about it



And you know I would never be able

To say that away from this dining room table...



Not a doubt how her life played out

That was Julia

All the details of who I am

Made irrelevant with one single telegram



That's what widowhood does

I resent it because

There are days when I just want to be

Momentarily free

And happily who I was
