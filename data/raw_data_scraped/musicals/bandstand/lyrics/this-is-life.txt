This is Life




DONNY

If we were in an MGM film,

We would kiss and walk through that door there.

If we were in a radio play,

We’d admit we’re friends, but there’s more there.



JULIA

If we were singing Hammerstein songs,

We could fix all the wrongs in rhyme.

But this is life, with a heartache it brings and

We know that these things take time.



DONNY

If we were in a Hemingway book,

We would laugh and drink till the morning.

If this were a ballet, then I might sweep

You off your feet without warning.



JULIA

Or filmed noir with a dangerous affair,

I would ask if you’d care to stay.

But this is life, and I’m wondering if

We should play it a different way.



DONNY

Maybe perfect nights of celebration,



JULIA

Hotel hallway brief flirtations.

Might be overrated



DONNY AND JULIA

Might be overrated, life’s more complicated.

We could write our own take on it.



JULIA

Or leave well enough, alone.



Shake on it.



DONNY

Shake on it.



No one planned for a moment like this,

There's no perfect script that provides us.

Words to say or the answers that might

Overcome the past that divides us.



BOTH

Movie stars with the passions they feel,

Somehow in the last reel unite



JULIA

You know.



DONNY

That's right.



DONNY AND JULIA

But this is life, so at least for today,

We should probably say, good night.
