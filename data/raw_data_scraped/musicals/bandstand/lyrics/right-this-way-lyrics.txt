Right This Way Lyrics


There is a train

it leaves the station at a quarter after five

and it’s direct

from union terminal right there at public square

a quarter after five

and where does it arrive?

At Grand Central Station



The Cleveland Limited of New York Central Railroad has first class pullman cars

for big time movie stars

and we’re gonna take one



I see it all

the leather seat

the steak we’ll eat

and then that train conductor’s call



he’ll say right this way

we reserved this just for you

you’ve been waiting for this day

it’s the least that we can do

let me take your bags my friend

you’ve been carrying those far too long

troubled times are at an end

and we’re waiting to hear your song

it’s a privilege sir, may i say?

right this way



and in times square

the hotel Astor stands 11 stories high

a first class grand hotel

the lobby’s in a movie that i saw last month as well

with garland and walker



and on the top

a rooftop garden with a bandstand in the sky

cream of the crop

where Dorsey swings and Ella sings

and I swear someday so will I



they’ll say right this way

we’ve reserved this just for you

you’ve been waiting for this day

it’s the last that we can do



you’ve arrived at last my friend

you’ve been fighting for far too long



after bunks on cargo ships

after trenches in the rain

after running for cover while dodging the flack

and 3 years and 8 months to fight my way back

and losing my faith

while busting my ass



[SPOKEN]

I think we’re entitled to travel first class

don’t you?



How?



[SUNG]

whatever gigs

whatever dates whatever bookings we can get

we’ll take ‘em all

if there’s a club in town where we can play a set

we are not finished

there’s liquor dives

and party rooms

and VA halls, I bet (Right!)

we fight for ourselves now



and all of the wrongs will be made right this way



we’ll be right this way (right this way)

after all that we’ve been through (what we’ve been through)

we’ve been waiting for this day (been waiting)

its the least that they can do (at last)

we’ve arrived at last my friend (my friend)

we’ve been fighting for far too long (far too long)

troubled times are at an end (are at an end)

and they’re waiting to hear our song



you can bet we intend to stay right this way
