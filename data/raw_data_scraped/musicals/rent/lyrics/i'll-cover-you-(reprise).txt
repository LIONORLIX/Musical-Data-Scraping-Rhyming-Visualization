I'll Cover You (Reprise)


(In a church. Angel's memorial)



MIMI

Angel was one of my closest friends.

It's right that it's Halloween, because it was her favorite holiday.

I knew we'd hit it off from the moment we met.

That skin head was bothering her, and she said she was more of a man than he'd ever be,

and more of a woman than he'd ever get...



MARK

...and then there was that time that he walked up to this group of tourists... and,

they were petrified, because, a)

they were obviously lost, and b)

they had probably never spoken

to a drag queen before in their lives...and he...she just offered

to escort them out of Alphabet City,

and then she let them take a picture with her,

and then she said she'd help 'em find the

Circle Line...



MAUREEN

...so much more original then any of us...you'd find

an old table cloth on the street and make a dress...and next year, sure

enough -- they'd be mass producing them at the Gap.

You always said how lucky you were that we were all friends.

But it was us, baby, who were the lucky ones.



COLLINS

Live in my house

I'll be your shelter

Just pay me back

With one thousand kisses

Be my lover

And I'll cover you

Open your door -- I'll be your tenant

Don't got much baggage to lay at your feet

But sweet kisses I've got to spare

I'll be there -- I'll cover you

I think they meant it

When they said you can't buy love

Now I know you can rent it

A new lease you were, my love, on life

All my life

I've longed to discover

Something as true

As this is



(The following is sung simultaneously.)



JOANNE & SOLOIST

So with a thousand sweet kisses

I'll cover you with a thousand sweet kisses

I'll cover you with a thousand sweet kisses

I'll cover you iwht a thousand sweet kisses

I'll cover you



COLLINS

If you're cold and you're lonely

You've got one nickel only

When you're worn out and tired

When your heart has expired



COMPANY

Five hundred twenty-five thousand six hundred minutes

Five hundred twenty-five thousand moments so dear

Five hundred twenty-five thousand six hundred minutes

Five hundred twenty-five thousand six hundred -- measure a year

Oh lover I'll cover you

Oh lover I'll cover you



COLLINS & COMPANY

Oh lover

I'll cover you

Oh lover



COLLINS

I'll cover you



COMPANY

Five hundred twenty-five thousand six hundred minutes

Five hundred twenty-five thousand seasons of love



COLLINS

I'll cover you
