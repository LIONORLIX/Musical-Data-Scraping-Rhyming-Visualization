Another Day


(The loft. MIMI plants a huge kiss on ROGER, who recoils.)



ROGER

Who do you think you are?

Barging in on me and my guitar

Little girl -- hey

The door is that way

You better go you know

The fire's out anyway

Take your powder -- take your candle

Your sweet whisper

I just can't handle

Well take your hair in the moonlight

Your brown eyes -- goodbye, goodnight

I should tell you I should tell you

I should tell you I should -- no!

Another time -- another place

Our temperature would climb

There'd be a long embrace

We'd do another dance

It'd be another play

Looking for romance?

Come back another day

Another day



MIMI

The heart may freeze or it can burn

The pain will ease if I can learn

There is no future

There is no past

I live this moment as my last

There's only us

There's only this

Forget regret

Or life is yours to miss

No other road

No other way

No day but today



ROGER

Excuse me if I'm off track

But if you're so wise

Then tell me -- why do you need smack?

Take your needle

Take your fancy prayer

And don't forget

Get the moonlight out of your hair

Long ago -- you might've lit up my heart

But the fire's dead -- ain't never ever gonna start

Another time -- another place

The words would only rhyme

We'd be in outer space

It'd be another song

We'd sing another way

You wanna prove me wrong?

Come back another day

Another day



MIMI

There's only yes

Only tonight

We must let go

To know what's right

No other course

No other way

No day but today



(Lights slowly fade up on the Life Support group.)



MIMI & OTHERS

I can't control

ROGER

Control your temper

MIMI & OTHERS

My destiny

ROGER

She doesn't see

MIMI & OTHERS

I trust my soul

ROGER

Who says that there's a soul

MIMI & OTHERS

My only goal is just to be

ROGER

Just let me be



MIMI & OTHERS

There's only now

There's only here

Give in to love

Or live in fear

No other path

No other way

No day but today

ROGER (simultaneously)

Who do you think you are?

Barging in on me and my guitar

Little girl, hey

The door is that way

The fire's out anyway



MIMI & OTHERS

No day but today

No day but today

No day but today

No day but today

No day but today

ROGER (simultaneously)

Take your powder; take your candle

Take your brown eyes, your pretty smile, your silhouette

Another time, another place

Another rhyme, a warm embrace

Another dance, another way

Another chance, another day





(MIMI and the Life Support group members exit. One person,

STEVE, remains at stage right, above.)
