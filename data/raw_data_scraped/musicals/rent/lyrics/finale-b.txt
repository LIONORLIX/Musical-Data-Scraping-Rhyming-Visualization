Finale B


(Suddenly, MIMI's hand twitches. Incredibly, she is still alive.)



MIMI

I jumped over the moon!!



ROGER

What?



MIMI

A leap of mooooooooooooooo--



JOANNE

She's back!



MIMI

I was in a tunnel. Heading for this warm, white light...



MAUREEN

Oh my god!



MIMI

And I swear Angel was there -- and she looked GOOD! And she said,

"Turn around, girlfriend, and listen to that boy's song..."



COLLINS

She's drenched



MAUREEN

Her fever's breaking



MARK

There is no future -- there is no past



ROGER

Thank God this moment's not the last



MIMI & ROGER

There's only us

There's only this

Forget regret or life is yours to miss



ALL

No other road no other way

No day but today



(As the finale grows, the entire COMPANY makes its way on stage.)



WOMEN

I can't control

My destiny

I trust my soul

My only goal is just to be



MEN

Will I lose my dignity?

Will someone care?

Will I wake tomorrow

From this nightmare?



(MARK's film resumes, along with two more films projecting on the back wall,

"Scenes from RENT...")



WOMEN

Without you

The hand gropes

The ear hears

The pulse beats

Life goes on

But I'm gone

'Cause I die

Without you

I die without you

I die without you

I die without you



MEN

There's only now

There's only here

Give in to love

Or live in fear

No other path

No other way

No day but today

No day but today

No day but today

No day but today



ALL

No day but today
