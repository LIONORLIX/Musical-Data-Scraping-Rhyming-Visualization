I Should Tell You


ROGER

I should tell you I'm disaster

I forget how to begin it



MIMI

Let's just make this part go faster

I have yet -- to be in it

I should tell you



ROGER

I should tell you



MIMI

I should tell you



ROGER

I should tell you



MIMI

I should tell I blew the candle out

Just to get back in



ROGER

I'd forgotten how to smile

Until your candle burned my skin



MIMI

I should tell you



ROGER

I should tell you



MIMI

I should tell you



BOTH

Here goes --



MIMI

Here goes

MIMI

BOTH

Who knows where

Who goes there

Who knows

Walking through fire without a burn

Clinging -- a shoulder, a leap begins

Stinging and older, asleep on pins

So here we go

Now we --



ROGER

MIMI

I know



ROGER

Oh no



BOTH

Who knows where -- who goes there

Here goes -- here goes

Here goes -- here goes

Here goes -- here goes
