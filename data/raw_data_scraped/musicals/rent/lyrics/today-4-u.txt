which i'll soon impart to the couch potatoes at new york university

Collins:

Angel:

Collins:

and you should hear her beat!



Roger:

you earned this on the street?



Angel:

it was my lucky day today on avenue a

when a lady in a limousine drove my way

she said, "dah-ling, be a dear, haven't slept in a year i need your help to make my neighbors yappy dog disappear!"



"this akita-evita just won't shut up! i believe if you play non-stop that pup will breathe its very last high-strung breath

i'm certain that cur will bark itself to death"



today for you-tomorrow for me

today for you-tomorrow for me



we agreed on a fee- a thousand dollars gurantee,

tax-free - and a bonus if i trim her tree

now who could fortell that it would go so well

but sure as i am here

that dog is now in doggy hell



after an hour-evita-in all her glory

on the window ledge of that 23rd story

like thelma and louise did when they got the blues

swan dove into the courtyard of the gracie mews



today for you-tomorrow for me

today for you-tomorrow for me



(drum solo)



back on the street where i met my sweet

where he was moaning and groaning on the

cold concrete

the nurse took him home for some

mercurochrome

and i dressed his wounds and got him back on his feet



sing it!

today for you-tomorrow for me

today for you-tomorrow for me

i said

today for you-tomorrow for me

today for you-tomorrow

for me!
