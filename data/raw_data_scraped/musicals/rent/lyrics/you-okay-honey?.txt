You Okay Honey?


[A HOMELESS MAN]



Christmas bells are ringing

Christmas bells are ringing

Christmas bells are ringing

Somewhere else!

Not here



[The HOMELESS MAN exits. ANGEL gets a good beat going on the tub,]

[but is interrupted by a moan. He starts to drum again and sees]

[COLLINS limp to downstage-left proscenium.]



[ANGEL]



You okay honey?



[COLLINS]



I'm afraid so



[ANGEL]



They get any money?



[COLLINS]



No

Had none to get --

But they purloined my coat --

Well you missed a sleeve! -- Thanks



[ANGEL]



Hell, it's Christmas Eve

I'm Angel



[COLLINS]



Angel..? Indeed

An angel of the first degree

Friends call me Collins -- Tom Collins

Nice tree ...



[ANGEL]



Let's get a band-aid for your knee

I'll change, there's a "Life Support" meeting at nine-thirty

Yes -- this body provides a comfortable home

For the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome



[COLLINS]



As does mine



[ANGEL]



We'll get along fine

Get you a coat, have a bite

Make a night -- I'm flush



[COLLINS]



My friends are waiting --



[ANGEL]



You're cute when you blush

The more the merri -- ho ho ho

And I do not take no



[ANGEL and COLLINS walk off stage right.]
