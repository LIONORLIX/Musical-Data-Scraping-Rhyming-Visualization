Light My Candle


[ROGER]



What'd you forget?



[MIMI enters, holding a candle and looking for a match;]

[her electricity is down, too.]



[MIMI]



Got a light?



[ROGER]



I know you? -- You're --

You're shivering



[MIMI]



It's nothing

They turned off my heat

And I'm just a little

Weak on my feet

Would you light my candle?

What are you staring at?



[ROGER]



Nothing

Your hair in the moonlight

You look familiar

[He lights her candle. MIMI starts to leave, but stumbles.]

Can you make it?



[MIMI]



Just haven't eaten much today

At least the room stopped spinning.

Anyway. What?



[ROGER]



Nothing

Your smile reminded me of --



[MIMI]



I always remind people of -- who is she?



[ROGER]



She died. Her name was April



[MIMI discreetly blows out the candle.]



[MIMI]



It's out again

Sorry about your friend

Would you light my candle?



[ROGER lights the candle. They linger, awkwardly.]



[ROGER]



Well --



[MIMI]



Yeah. Ow!



[ROGER]



Oh, the wax -- it's --



[MIMI]



Dripping! I like it -- between my --



[ROGER]



Fingers. I figured...

Oh, well. Goodnight.



[MIMI exits. ROGER heads back toward his guitar on the table.]

[There is another knock, which he answers.]



It blew out again?



[MIMI]



No -- I think that I dropped my stash



[ROGER]



I know I've seen you out and about

When I used to go out

Your candle's out



[MIMI]



I'm illin' --

I had it when I walked in the door

It was pure --

Is it on the floor?



[ROGER]



The floor?



[MIMI gets down on all fours and starts searching]

[the floor for her stash. She lookss back at ROGER,]

[who is staring at her again.]



[MIMI]



They say I have the best ass below 14th street

Is it true?



[ROGER]



What?



[MIMI]



You're staring again.



[ROGER]



Oh no.

I mean you do -- have a nice --

I mean -- You look familiar



[MIMI]



Like your dead girlfriend?



[ROGER]



Only when you smile.

But I'm sure I've seen you somewhere else --



[MIMI]



Do you go to the Cat Scratch Club?

That's where I work - I dance - help me look



[ROGER]



Yes!

They used to tie you up --



[MIMI]



It's a living



[MIMI douses the flame again.]



[ROGER]



I didn't recognize you

Without the handcuffs



[MIMI]



We could light the candle

Oh won't you light the candle?



[ROGER lights it again.]



[ROGER]



Why don't you forget that stuff

You look like you're sixteen



[MIMI]



I'm nineteen -- but I'm old for my age

I'm just born to be bad



[ROGER]



I once was born to be bad

I used to shiver like that



[MIMI]



I have no heat -- I told you



[ROGER]



I used to sweat



[MIMI]



I got a cold



[ROGER]



Uh huh

I used to be a junkie



[MIMI]



But now and then I like to --



[ROGER]



Uh huh



[MIMI]



Feel good



[ROGER]



Here it -- um --



[ROGER stoops and picks up a small object: MIMI's stash.]



[MIMI]



What's that?



[ROGER]



It's a candy bar wrapper



[ROGER puts it behind his back and into his pocket.]



[MIMI]



We could light the candle



[ROGER discreetly blows out the candle.]



[MIMI]



What'd you do with my candle?



[ROGER]



That was my last match



[MIMI]



Our eyes'll adjust, thank God for the moon



[ROGER]



Maybe it's not the moon at all

I hear Spike Lee's shooting down the street



[MIMI]



Bah humbug ... Bah humbug



[MIMI places her hand under his, pretending to do it by accident.]



[ROGER]



Cold hands



[MIMI]



Yours too.

Big. Like my father's

You wanna dance?



[ROGER]



With you?



[MIMI]



No -- with my father



[ROGER]



I'm Roger



[MIMI]



They call me

They call me Mimi



[They come extremely close to a kiss.]

[MIMI reaches into his pocket, nabs the stash,]

[waves it in front of his face, and makes a sexy exit.]
