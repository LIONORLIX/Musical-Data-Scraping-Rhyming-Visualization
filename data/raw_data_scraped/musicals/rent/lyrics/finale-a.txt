Finale A


(The lot and the loft)



ALL SEVEN HOMELESS

Christmas bells are ringing

Christmas bells are ringing

Christmas bells are ringing

How time flies

When compassion dies

No stockings

No candy canes

No gingerbread

No safety net

No loose change

No change no



ONE HOMELESS MAN

"Santy Claus is coming"



ALL

Cause Santy Claus ain't coming

No room at the Holiday Inn -- again

Well, maybe next year --

Or -- when



(Lights shift back to the loft.

A small projector rests on a milk crate, which is on a dolly.)



MARK

December 24th, ten p.m. Eastern standard time

I can't believe a year went by so fast

Time to see what we have time to see

Turn the projector on

(A rough title credit, "Today 4 U: Proof Positive," appears,

followed by a shot from last Christmas of ROGER tuning his guitar.)

First shot Roger

With the fender guitar he just got out of hock

When he sold the car

That took him away and back



ROGER

I found my song



MARK

He found his song

If he could just find Mimi



ROGER

I tried -- you know I tried



(MARK's image appears on-screen.)



MARK

Fade in on Mark

Who's still in the dark



ROGER

But he's got great footage



MARK

Which he's cut together



ROGER

To screen tonight



(BENNY's image appears on screen.)



MARK

In honor of Benny's wife



ROGER

Muffy



MARK

Alison

Pulling Benny out of the East Village location



(The projector blows a fuse. Blackout.)



ROGER

Then again, maybe we won't screen it tonight.



MARK

I wonder how Alison found out about Mimi?



ROGER

Maybe a little bird told her.



(COLLINS enters in the dark, with several twenty-dollar bills in each hand.)



COLLINS

Or an angel.

(Lights fade up.)

I had a little hunch that you could use a little flow



ROGER

Tutoring again?



COLLINS

Negative



MARK

Back at N.Y.U.?



COLLINS

No, no, no

I rewired the ATM at the food emporium

To provide an honorarium to anyone with the code



ROGER & MARK

The code --

Well...?



COLLINS

A-N-G-E-L

Yet Robin Hooding isn't the solution

The powers that be must be undermined where they dwell

In a small, exclusive gourmet institution

Where we overcharge the wealthy clientele



ALL THREE

Let's open up a restaurant in Santa Fe

With a private corner banquette in the back



COLLINS

We'll make it yet, we'll somehow get to Santa Fe



ROGER

But you'd miss New York before you could unpack



ALL

Ohh--



(MAUREEN and JOANNE enter, carrying MIMI.)



MAUREEN

Mark! Roger! Anyone -- help!



MARK

Maureen?



MAUREEN

It's Mimi -- I can't get her up the stairs



ROGER

No!



(They enter the loft.)



MAUREEN

She was huddled in the park in the dark

And she was freezing

And begged to come here



ROGER

Over here

Oh, God --



(They lay her down carefully on the table.)



MIMI

Got a light -- I know you -- you're shivering...



JOANNE

She's been living on the street



ROGER

We need some heat



MIMI

I'm shivering



MARK

We can buy some wood and something to eat



COLLINS

I'm afraid she needs more than heat



MIMI

I heard that



MAUREEN

Collins will call for a doctor, honey



MIMI

Don't waste your money on Mimi, me, me



COLLINS

Hello -- 911?

I'm on hold!



MIMI

Cold...cold... would you light my candle?



ROGER

Yes -- we'll -- oh God -- find a candle



MIMI

I should tell you

I should tell you



ROGER

I should tell you

I should tell you



MIMI

I should tell you

Benny wasn't any--



ROGER

Shhh--I know

I should tell you why I left

It wasn't cause I didn't --



MIMI

I know

I should tell you



ROGER

I should tell you



MIMI (whispering)

I should tell you

I love you--

(MIMI fades)



ROGER

Who do you think you are?

Leaving me alone with my guitar

Hold on there's something you should hear

It isn't much but it took all year



(MIMI stirs and ROGER begins playing acoustic guitar at her bedside.)
