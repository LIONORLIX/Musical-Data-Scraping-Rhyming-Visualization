Seasons Of Love B


All: in diapers, report cards,

In spoke wheels

In speeding tickets

In contracts

Dollars in funerals and births.

Five hundred twenty five thousand six hundred minutes.

How do you figure our last year on earth.

Figure in love

Figure in love

Figure in love

Measure in love

Seasons of love

Seasons of love
