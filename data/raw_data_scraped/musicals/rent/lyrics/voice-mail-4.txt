Mark Cohen

Labor Day weekend

In East Hampton

On the beach

Just saw Alec Baldwin

Told him you say hi

Just kidding

We still need directors

You still need money

You know you need money

Pick up the phone

Don't be afraid of ker-ching ker-ching

Marky -- sell us your soul

Just kidding

We're waiting...
