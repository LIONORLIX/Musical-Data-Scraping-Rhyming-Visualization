I'll Cover You


MARK

I'll meet you at the show.

I'll try and convince Roger to go.

(MARK exits)



ANGEL

Alone at last...



COLLINS

He'll be back, I guarantee.



ANGEL

I've been hearing violins all night!



COLLINS

Anything to do with me? Are we a thing?



ANGEL

Darling... we're everything!



Live in my house

I'll be your shelter

Just pay me back

With one thousand kisses

Be my lover -- I'll cover you



COLLINS

Open your door

I'll be your tenant

Don't got much baggage

To lay at your feet

But sweet kisses I've got to spare

I'll be there -- I'll cover you



BOTH

I think they meant it

When they said you can't buy love

Now I know you can rent it

A new lease you are, my love,

On life -- be my life



(They do a short dance.)



Just slip me on

I'll be your blanket

Wherever -- whatever -- I'll be your coat



ANGEL

You'll be my king

And I'll be your castle



COLLINS

No you'll be my queen

And I'll be your moat



BOTH

I think they meant it

When they said you can't buy love

Now I know you can rent it

A new lease you are, my love,

On life -- all my life



I've longed to discover

Something as true as this is



COLLINS

So with a thousand

sweet kisses

I'll cover you

With a thousand sweet kisses

I'll cover you

When you're worn

out and tired

When your heart has expired

ANGEL (simultaneously)

If you're cold

And you're lonely

You've got one nickel only

With a thousand sweet kisses

I'll cover you

With a thousand sweet kisses

I'll cover you



BOTH

Oh lover I'll cover you

Oh lover I'll cover you
