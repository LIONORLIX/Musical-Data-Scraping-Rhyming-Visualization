Pan to the padlocked door. New Year's rocking eve. The

breaking-back-into-the-building party...



Mimi

How long till next year?



Roger

Three and a half minutes



Mimi

I'm giving up my vices

I'm going back- Back to school

Eviction or not this weeks been so hot

As long as I got you I know I'll be cool

I couldn't crack the love code dear

Til you made the lock on my heart explode!

It's gonna be a Happy New Year

A Happy New Year



Mark

Cost is clear

Roger

Bolted plywood padlocked with a chain

A total dead end



Maureen

Just like my ex girlfriend



Honey I know your there

Please pick up the phone

Are you okay?



It's not funny

It's not fair

How can I atone?

Are you okay?



I lose control but I can learn to behave

Give me one more chance

Let me be your slave

I'll kiss your Doc Martens

Let me kiss your Doc Martens!

Your every wish I will obey

Joanne

Technically your squatters

Mark and Joanne

that bench



Maureen

Joanne

So start hoisting, Wench!



Roger

I think I should be laughing

Yet I forget- Forget how to begin

I'm feeling something inside and yet I still can't decide

If I should hide or made a wide open grin



Last week I wanted just to dissapear

My life was dust

But now it just may be a Happy New Year

A Happy New Year

Mark

Ironic close up tight

On the phone machine's red light

Once the boho boys are gone

The power mysteriously comes on...
