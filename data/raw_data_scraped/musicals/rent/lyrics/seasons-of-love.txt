Seasons Of Love


COMPANY

525,600 minutes, 525,000 moments so dear.

525,600 minutes - how do you measure, measure a year?

In daylights, in sunsets, in midnights, in cups of coffee.

In inches, in miles, in laughter, in strife.

In 525,600 minutes - how do you measure a year in the life?

How about love? How about love? How

about love? Measure in love.

Seasons of love.



SOLOIST 1

525,600 minutes! 525,000 journeys to plan.

525,600 minutes - how can you measure the life of a woman or man?



SOLOIST 2

In truths that she

learned,

Or in times that he cried.

In bridges he burned,

Or the way that she died....



COMPANY

It's time now to sing out,

though the story never ends

let's celebrate, remember a year in the life of friends.

Remember the love!

Remember the love!

Remember the love!

Measure in love.

Seasons of love! Seasons of love.
