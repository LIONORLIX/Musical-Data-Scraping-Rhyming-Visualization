(JOANNE's loft. In blackout another phone rings. We see MAUREEN in silhouette.)



MAUREEN

Hi. You've reached Maureen and Joanne.

Leave a message and don't forget "Over the Moon" -- My performance, protesting the

eviction of the Homeless (and artists) from the Eleventh Street Lot.

Tonight at midnight in the lot between A and B.

Party at Life Cafe to follow (BEEP)



MR. JEFFERSON

Well, Joanne -- We're off

I tried you at the office

And they said you're stage managing or something



MRS. JEFFERSON

Remind her that those unwed mothers in Harlem

Need her legal help too



MR. JEFFERSON

Call Daisy for our itinerary or Alfred at Pound Ridge

Or Eileen at the state department in a pinch

We'll be at the spa for new year's

Unless the senator changes his mind



MRS. JEFFERSON

The hearings



MR. JEFFERSON

Oh yes -- Kitten

Mummy's confirmation hearing begins on the tenth

We'll need you -- alone -- by the sixth



MRS. JEFFERSON

Harold!



MR. JEFFERSON

You hear that?

It's three weeks away

And she's already nervous



MRS. JEFFERSON

I am not!



MR. JEFFERSON

For Mummy's sake, Kitten

No Doc Martens this time and wear a dress ...

Oh, and Kitten -- have a merry



MRS. JEFFERSON

And a bra!!
