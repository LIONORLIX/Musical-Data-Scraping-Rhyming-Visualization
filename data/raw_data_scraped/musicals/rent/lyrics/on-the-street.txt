On The Street


THREE HOMELESS PEOPLE

Christmas bells are ringing

Christmas bells are ringing

Christmas bells are ringing --

Out of town

Santa Fe



SQUEEGEEMAN

Honest living, man!



(He recoils as though he's almost been run over by a car.)



Feliz Navidad!



(Three POLICE OFFICERS, in full riot gear,

enter and approach sleeping BLANKET PERSON.

The FIRST OFFICER pokes her with a nightstick.)



HOMELESS PERSON

Evening, officers



(Without answering, the FIRST OFFICER raises his nightstick again.)



MARK (pointing his camera)

Smile for Ted Koppel, Officer Martin!



(The FIRST OFFICER lowers his stick.)



HOMELESS PERSON

And a Merry Christmas to your family



POLICE OFFICERS

Right!!



(The POLICE OFFICERS stride offstage.

MARK continues to film BLANKET PERSON.)



BLANKET PERSON (To MARK)

Who the fuck do you think you are?

I don't need no goddamn help

From some bleeding heart cameraman

My life's not for you to

Make a name for yourself on!



ANGEL

Easy, sugar, easy

He was just trying to --



BLANKET PERSON

Just trying to use me to kill his guilt

It's not that kind of movie, honey

Let's go -- this lot is full of

Motherfucking artists

Hey artist

You gotta dollar?

I thought not



(BLANKET PERSON crosses to downstage left with another HOMELESS PERSON.)
