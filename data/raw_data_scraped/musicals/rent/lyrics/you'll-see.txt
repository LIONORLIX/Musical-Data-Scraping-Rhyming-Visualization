You'll See


YOU'LL SEE



(BENNY enters.)



BENNY

Joy to the world--

Hey, you bum -- yeah, you, move over

Get your ass off that range rover



MARK

That attitude toward the homeless is just what

Maureen is protesting tonight.

(Holding camera up to BENNY)

Close up: Benjamin Coffin the third, our ex-roommate who married Alison Grey,

of the Westport Greys -- then bought the

building and the lot next door from his father-in-law in hopes of starting a cyber-studio.



BENNY

Maureen is protesting

Losing her performance space

Not my attitude



ROGER

What happened to Benny

What happened to his heart

And the ideals he once pursued?



BENNY

The owner of that lot next door

Has a right to do with it as he pleases



COLLINS

Happy birthday, Jesus!



BENNY

The rent



MARK

You're wasting your time



ROGER

We're broke



MARK

And you broke your word -- this is absurd



BENNY

There is one way you won't have to pay



ROGER

I knew it!



BENNY

Next door, the home of Cyberarts, you see

And now that the block is re-zoned

Our dream can become a reality

You'll see boys

You'll see boys

A state of the art, digital, virtual interactive studio

I'll forego your rent and on paper guarantee

That you can stay here for free

If you do me one small favor



MARK

What?



BENNY

Convince Maureen to cancel her protest



MARK

Why not just get an injunction or call the cops



BENNY

I did, and they're on stand by

But my investors would rather

I handle this quietly



ROGER

You can't quietly wipe out an entire tent city

Then watch 'It's a Wonderful Life' on TV!



BENNY

You want to produce films and write songs?

You need somewhere to do it!

It's what we used to dream about

Think twice before you pooh-pooh it

You'll see boys

You'll see boys

You'll see -- the beauty of a studio

That lets us do our work and get paid

With condos on the top

Whose rent keeps open our shop

Just stop the protest

And you'll have it made

You'll see -- or you'll pack



(BENNY exits.)



ANGEL

That boy could use some prozac



ROGER

Or heavy drugs



MARK

Or group hugs



COLLINS

Which reminds me --

We have a detour to make tonight

Anyone who wants to can come along



ANGEL

Life support's a group for people coping with life

You don't have to stay too long



MARK

First I've got a protest to save



ANGEL

Roger?



ROGER

I'm not much company you'll find



MARK

Behave!



ANGEL

He'll catch up later -- He's just go other things on his mind

You'll see boys



MARK & COLLINS

We'll see boys



ROGER

Let it be boys!



COLLINS

I like boys



ANGEL

Boys like me



ALL

We'll see.
