Nobody Wants To Be Moist


Nobody wants to be moist

A bunch of overactive pores

I struggle opening doors

And i lose every tug of war



Nobody wants to be wet

Though sweet soul i do secrete

Can't make damp fingers snap to the beat



The microphone is dripping

My baritone is slipping

A rhyme into this line i'll have to foist

Nobody wants to be moist



Nobody wants to be moist

Though on the dance floor i glide

On stairs i'm petrified

(that's how Harry Reasoner died)



Nobody wants to be soaked

Though it is with a graceful ease

I deduce in which way blows the breeze



Oh sure i have the power

To make paste from a powder

But last time i did that no one rejoiced

Nobody wants to be moist



A man so ancillary

My little song is buried

Not till the commentary is it voiced

Nobody wants to be

Nobody wants to be

Nobody wants to be moist
