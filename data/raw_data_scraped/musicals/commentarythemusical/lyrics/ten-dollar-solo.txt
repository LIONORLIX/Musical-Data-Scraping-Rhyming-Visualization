Ten Dollar Solo


Stacy

They think i?m no one

I don?t have a name

But i want to live forever

Just like in ?fame?

(but not as depressing; i hear the remake is better)



Two weeks in the business

Still got no breaks

The people all say i?ll never

Have what it takes



But i can?t lose

I?ve paid my dues



Ten dollar solo

Worth every dime

My path is so steep

But my god joss is cheap

And doesn?t mind wasting your time



See the bad horse chorus

Jump into frame

They tell me i?m not ready

To get in the game



But i?ll show them

My atm



Ten dollar solo

Not bad so far

There?s internal rhyme

Although not every instance

And the meter is occasionally a little bit bizarre



They say hollywood is heartless

And only the strongest survives

But i like it plenty

I gave joss a twenty

And got back a dream and two fives



So here comes my



Neil:

Ten dollar solo ? Solomente baby!



Stacy:

No, this is my scene



Neil:

Your scene, i?ve seen your scene



Stacy:

You?re wonderful, neil

But joss made me a deal



Neil:

Suck it ? I gave him fifteen? Yeaeeeeaaahh!!!



Stacy and neil:

Ten dollar lame-o



Stacy:

Are those the words now?



Stacy and neil:

How could i(you) know

That joss pays his debt

With this cheesy duet

When you stoop so low

Then you say so long

Solo
