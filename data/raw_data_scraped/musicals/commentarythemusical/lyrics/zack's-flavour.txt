Zack's Flavour


I don`t do songs, i`m all about the written word

And you should see me write graffiti, concrete`s preferred

There`s nothin` Worse than hearing verse sung like a tweety bird

Unless it`s screamin` `Cause i`m beatin` Up a theater nerd

Or haven`t you heard `

I`m the black sheep in a band of brothers

Who sit around singing showtunes

Giving back rubs to each other

You make a musical, don`t matter if it`s witty or pretty

That`s a one way ticket to buttkicked city

Where you all are permanent residents

Do you need a little more evidence`

Dr. Horrible - hey that`s sound kinda dark and cool

Sing-along blog - what the f*!k is this`  Preschool`



Zacky`s doing us a little favor

Blessin` Commentary with his flavor

Don`t tell him it`s a musical

`Cause then he might kill us all



You people are in freefall, straight into a cheese ball

I get a message please call my bookie buddy, he`s all -

What the hell is up with you up on hulu

Thought we were layin` Low after that hooker snafu

I said, hey listen, you just misunderstood

I got to get in on this web shit while the gettin`s good

I didn`t know there were songs, that sh#t makes me sick

My brother said it`s about a guy who kills some chick



Jed:

Hey, weren`t you a prince in `the king and i` In seventh grade`



Zack:

No, but i was backstage in the dark getting laid



Jed:

Weren`t you pigpen in that `charlie brown` Show we did`



Zack:

No, i just wandered on stage during my homeless period



Jed:

Didn`t you sing about the business in `annie get your gun``



Zack:

Is that what that was`  I`ve been tanked up since ninety-one



Jed:

Weren`t you the tin man in `the wizard of oz` Or something`



Zack:

Yeah, but i played the f*!k out of that part.

I wrote all the good lines and i made them funny

But i was only in it for the horrible money

Plus some were cut out, cause joss is such a wuss he

Cut my line for the girl, `the penny is my p_ssy`

Not to mention my whole moist storyline

Where he gets caught selling blow at a rest stop and serves time

And then he get`s out and tries to get

His sh#t together

And teaches art to underprivileged kids at the local high school,

But things take an interesting turn when an old

Gambling buddy comes to collect.

See it`s his former life coming back to haunt him.

You can`t outrun your past.  See`  Get it`  That`s the point, joss.

It`s compelling!

What`s going to happen to these kids`!
