Neil's Turn


Have they all gone?

Yes! It`s neil`s turn

No more writers to whine

Now the whole show is mine



No more nathan

With his bean dip

Say goodnight, frankenstein

`Cause it`s my turn to shine



I can do all of their jobs

I can just play with these knobs

And i`ll sound fine



It`s a one-man

Like hal holbrook

Like that showcase for liza

It`s `neil with an i`



Hey felicia

You were great, kid

But you just had to die

`Cause there`s no `team` In `i`



I`ll sing my own harmonies

I`ll go as low as i please

Or i`ll go high



Welcome everybody to my commentary

I`ve got so much talent it`s a little scary

Is my every random thought insightful ` Very

Not just entertaining; i`m a luminary



I`ll charm the chicks

Are those things real` Ha!

Do magic tricks

Was it the three of clubs`  Ho!

Lay down some tap

And i can rap



My name is neil and i`m here to say



No i can`t rap

That was painful

Let`s move on to the part

Where i talk about art



Look at that shot

We used cameras

There`s a boom guy in frame

He was great ` What`s his name`



What was his name`

What should i say`

The choices are endless

And here i am at last, alone, and friendless

No i`m not friendless

I`ve got some friends

They`ll be here when this ends

If this ends

What do i say

What does this switch do ` It turns out the lights

Now it`s dark and i`m lost and alone

And what`s with all these chords`

What`s with all these weird chords`

Somebody help

Somebody say cut

Somebody say action

Somebody say something

I`m so afraid

Somebody say cut

I`m so alone
