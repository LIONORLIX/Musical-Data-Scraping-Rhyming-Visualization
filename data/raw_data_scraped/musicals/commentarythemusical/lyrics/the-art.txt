The Art


When i first meet hammer i stumble and stammer

?Cause that?s what it says to do in the script

But whenever i would practice that was just and act this

Is all so real ? He?s so well equipped

Falling into nathan?s eyes is easy

I don?t even realize he?s cheesy

?Cause jeez he?s so great

Wait



But it?s not about nate

Gotta concentrate

?Cause i?m looking for internal truth and not a date

No it?s not about nate

?Cause it?s all about the art



Perfect, mysterious, comes from above

Magic as a magic thing and lovely as love

A gift from olympus, who send me the muse

And shoes



If i walk with a twitch in the scene in the kitchen

First date jitters aren?t to blame

?Cause all penny feels are these nine inch heels

Which are gonna make me fall and die and aren?t in frame

But my death-scene pumps are really dreamy

Right when billy dumps my corpse, it?s steamy

To see me all ? Wait

Oh i?m sorry i lost my train of thought i?m being such a bimbo!



But it?s not about shoes

Even if they?re sweet

They should focus on my tragedy and not my feet

No it?s not about shoes

When it?s all about the art



Memory, method, primal and deep

All stanislavsky, strasberg and streep

Truth, mr. Lipton, that?s how you build

The guild



But it?s not about the guild

I?d be killed

If i shilled

For the guild

On somebody else?s time

Then again, i sort of was killed

The guild season one availble on dvd plus

New epidsodes at the watchtheguild.com we also have t-shirts



Joss:

Felicia!



Catch guild fever



My tortured actor?s process:

Stand here and do what joss says

Remember that it?s not about



The weird beard on otto

The beer and clamato

The hair in the cheese and

The guild?s second season

And brand new day neil

That intro?s unreal

A horse ? Not too shabby

Now steady?s all crabby

The soldier boy extra

Good times ? No, i?ll text ya

The red bull neil?s drinking

I?m dead and i?m blinking

And joss?s ungluing

When i mention pooing

Which i?m always doing

I mean mentioning pooing

I mean art

Art

Art?s really easy?
