Ninja Ropes


Jed:

There?s a game on my phone

That i sometimes like to play when i?m alone

Go to google, type it in

Click the extreme edition

And in moments you?ll begin and you?ll be thinking ?

This is dope



Ninja ropes

Ninja ropes



Neil and nathan:

We did not get along



Nathan:

I thought neil was given far too many songs



Neil and nathan:

Both threw insults at each other



Neil:

Told you how i f#!ked your mother



Neil and nathan:

But what made us tight as brothers and forever one would hope



All:

Ninja ropes

Ninja ropes



Careful as you hurtle from one circle to the next

Sometimes double back to dodge the gravity vortex

Two ropes is the key to keep from wheeling way to far

Nathan holds the record -



Nathan:

One nineteen point seven yards



Jed:

Now the shoot is complete



All:

And into our separate lives we do retreat



Neil:

But instead of solitaire



Neil and nathan:

Sinking deep into despair



All:

It reminds us the connection that we share and helps us cope



Ninja ropes

Ninja ropes

Ninja ropes?



You?ve got just one life to fly and dive from place to place

Don?t ask why a ninja can survive in outer space

Friends say, ?hey man can i have a go? And i say, ?nope?

Simple in it?s game play and yet epic in it?s scope



Simple in it's game play and yet epic in it's scope

Ninja ropes?
