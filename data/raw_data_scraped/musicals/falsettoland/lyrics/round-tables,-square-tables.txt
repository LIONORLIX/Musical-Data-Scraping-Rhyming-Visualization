Round Tables, Square Tables


(Jason)

They always yell,

Isn't that unfortunate'-

When Marvin's here.

Everyone's yelling about the bar mitzvah.

It's not a wrestling match,

Why are they sweating'

It's not a funeral,

What's so upsetting'



It's a celebration

Where I get presents.

But everybody's yelling and everybody's ruining it,

Everybody's ruining it.



It's a celebration

Where I get richer.

But everybody's yelling and everybody's ruining it,

Everybody's ruining it.



Why, oh, why'

What have I done that they'd ruin my bar mitzvah?

What have I done that they'd ruin my bar mitzvah?



(Trina)

I want the tables round, musicians with a new sound.



(Marvin)

OK, I'll trade, but please don't make it pink.



(Trina and Mendel)

Pink'



(Trina)

It must be-



(Marvin)

I want lobster.



(Trina)

Catered kosher.



(Marvin)

No can do.



(Trina)

Pink is my-



(Marvin)

Help me!



(Trina)

Favorite color-



(Marvin)

Why'



(Trina)

Rock musician.



(Marvin)

String quartet!



(Trina)

Are you done'



(Marvin)

Not yet!



(Jason)

Ugh!

There's no reason to fight.

It is just a bar mitzvah!

Go ahead and invite

Whomever you please,

Just stop shrecking and wrecking the night!

I am getting irate!

Please stop shrecking.



(Jason and Mendel)

Please stop shrecking.

Please stop shrecking.

Please stop shrecking.



(Marvin)

Things are better, aren't they?

I feel we've grown closer.



(Trina)

Maybe we've grown closer,

But we still have a party to make.

We have a party to make.



(Marvin)

And it's gonna be swell!

It'll be Marvin's triumph!



(Trina)

And Trina's!



(Marvin)

Our kid will excell,

And the flowers delight!



(Trina)

Thank Trina!



(Marvin)

All in all, it'll be nonpareil,

Like the perfect occasion!



(Trina)

Round tables!



(Marvin)

Square tables!



(Jason)

Please don't do this.



(Marvin)

He's no jerk!



(Trina)

It's just that-



(Marvin)

It took-



(Mendel)

Please don't do this.



(Marvin)

Work!



(Jason)

I hate this!



(Marvin)

Blame her, it is all a waste!



(Trina)

Look at your couch, it is homo-baroque!

Don't talk to me about taste!



(Jason) (speaking)

Stop! I don't want a bar mitzvah, OK?

I don't want a bar mitzvah!



(Marvin and Trina) (singing)

...What do you mean, you 'don't want a bar mitzvah?

What do you mean, you 'don't want a bar mitzvah?

How do you think we,

How do you think we,

How do you think we feel about that'
