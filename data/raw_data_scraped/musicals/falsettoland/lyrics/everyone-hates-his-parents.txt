Everyone Hates His Parents


(Mendel)

Jason, I am agitato grande.

Jason, I am muy disgutante,

And muy disappointe, and muy naseatus,

And me mitzraim hotzionoo dayenu!

Oh, day, dayenu!

Day, dayenu!

Day, dayenu!



Everyone hates his parents,

Don't be ashamed.

You'll grow up, you'll come through,

You'll have kids, and they'll hate you too!

Oh, everyone hates his parents,

But, I confess,

You grow up, you get old, you hate less!



(Jason)

But I don't want it.

Nothing that gives them pleasure, I'll do.

I don't want a bar mitzvah,

Want a bar mitzvah,

Want a bar mitzvah. Would you'



(Mendel)

Everyone hates his parents.

That's in the Torah!

It's what history shows!

In fact, God said to Moses, 'Moses,

Everyone hates his parents,

That's how it is.'

And God knew because God hated his!



(Marvin)

You are gonna kill your mother.

Don't feel guilty, kill your mother.

Rather than humiliate her,

Killing your mother is the merciful thing to do.



(Trina)

Jason, darling, don't get nervous.

I'm right here and at your service.

Look, I'm calm and self-deluded,

Grateful cause I hope you'll do what I pray you'll do.



(Marvin)

Go ahead and kill your mother.



(Trina)

Not with guns, but kill your mother.



(Marvin and Trina)

Rather than humiliate her,

Killing your mother is the merciful thing to do.



(Jason)

Ugh!



(Mendel)

Everyone hates his parents.

Now I see why!

But in time, they'll cool out

And you'll think, 'They were only fooling'.

It's a strange thing about parents,

Push comes to shove,

What was hate becomes more or less love!



(Marvin and Trina)

Jason, please see a psychiatrist.



(Mendel) (speaking)

I'm a psychiatrist! Get lost!

(singing) Everyone hates his parents!

This too shall pass!

You'll grow up,



(Jason)

I'll come through, I'll have kids,



(Mendel)

And they'll hate you too!



(Mendel and Jason)

Oh, everyone hates his parents!



(Mendel)

But, kid, I guess

You'll grow up,



(Jason)

I'll grow up,



(Mendel)

You'll get old,



(Jason)

I'll get old,



(Mendel and Jason)

And hate less!

And hate less!
