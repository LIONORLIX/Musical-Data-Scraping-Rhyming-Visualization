MARVIN:

It's about time, don't ya think?

It's about time to grow up, don't ya think?

It's about time to grow up and face the music.

It's about time.



I had a wife,

I had a lover,

He ran for cover, she I divorced.

I got hissed when I cracked my lover on the wrist,

She got pissed and ran off with my psychiatrist.

So I don't have a psychiatrist,

Except on the Jewish holidays but I still have my son on the weekends.

Just on the weekends,

And some very good friends.

But I don't have a lover anymore,

Oh my God.

When am I gonna get over this.

When am I gonna get over this.

When am I gonna get over this.

MARVIN:

It's about time, don't ya think.

It's about time to grow up, don't ya think.

It's about time to grow up and face the music.

It's about time.

One day I'd like to be,

As mature as my son, who's twelve and a half.

And this tall!

That's all I'd like to be.

It's about growing up, getting older, living on a lover's shoulder.

Learning love is not a crime.

It's about time.

It's about time.

It's about time.

It's about-
