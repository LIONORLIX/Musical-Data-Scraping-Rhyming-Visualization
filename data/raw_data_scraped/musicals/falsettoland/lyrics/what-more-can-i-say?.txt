What More Can I Say?


(The lights rise on MARVIN and WHIZZER in bed. Slats of morning light

cover the designer sheets. Above their heads is a Mapplethorpe of a

calia lily. MARVIN is wearing a white T-shirt. Whizzer is wearing

nothing. During the whole song, MARVIN barely moves. WHIZZER,

sleeping, is slowly moving--next to MARVIN or apart, into MARVIN's

arms, onto his stomach or his back. Whatever, it's both hot and

incredibly innocent.)



MARVIN:

It's been hot,

Also very sweet.

And I'm not usually indiscreet.

But when he sparkles,

The earth begins to sway.

What more can I say?

How can I express

How confused am I by our happiness?

I can't eat breakfast,

I cannot tie my shoe.

What more can I do?



If I said I love him,

You might think my words come cheap.

Let's just say

I'm glad he's mine awake,

Asleep.



It's been hot

Also it's been swell.

More than not,

It's been more than words can tell.

I halt.

I stammer.

I sing a rondelay.

What more can I say?



I'll stay calm.

Untie my tongue.

And try to stay

Both kind and young.



I was taught

Never brag or shout.

Still it's hot,

Just like how you read about.

And also funny,

And never too uncouth.

That's the simple truth.



(WHIZZER is sleeping face up. MARVIN looks underneath the sheet and is

stunned by his good fortune.)



Can you tell

I have been revised?

It's so swell,

Damn it, even I'm surprised.

We laugh,

We fumble

We take it day by day.

What more can I say?



(Blackout)
