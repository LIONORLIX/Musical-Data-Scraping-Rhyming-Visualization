Days Like This


(Marvin)

Whizzer, kid, you're looking very good today.

You had to see yourself a few days back,

I had a heart attack!

Jesus'

But today you seem to be

On the way to recovery!

Oh, Whizzer, I want to applaud!

It's days like this I almost believe in God,

Days like this I almost believe

In God.



(Whizzer) (speaking)

Hello!



(Cordelia)

Hello!



(Whizzer)

(laughs) Hey.



(Cordelia) (singing)

Rugelach!

Gefilte fish!

It's so good, you'd think it's Italian!

Also a soup made from chicken

That, though un-exotic, is antibiotic!

Why, I'm up to my ass

In a kosher morass!

For aches and croup,

Try my chicken soup!



(Marvin)

Whizzer, kid, you're looking very good today.

You had to see yourself a few days back,

I had a heart attack!

(Cordelia) (overlapping)

So let's begin.

It's medicine!

It could be we're both going to cure you,

Me with my soup,

She with her medication.

Such elation!



(Marvin and Cordelia)

But today you seem to be

On the way to recovery!

Oh, Whizzer, I want to applaud!

It's days like this we almost believe in God,

Days like this we almost believe

In



(Cordelia)

Canadelach!

Gefilte fish!



(Marvin) (overlapping)

God!



(Trina)

He had trouble parking,

Just like on our second date.



(Mendel)

I hyperventilate.

But since I'm parking in the city, I've improved,

Or else the hydrants moved! (Trina laughs)

Yeah, go ahead, be good and pissed.

'How can I help'', says the wiry psychiatrist!



(Trina)

He'll make you well!



(Mendel)

I'll make you well!



(Whizzer) (speaking)

Haha, right.



(Charlotte and Jason) (singing)

Whizzer, hello!



(Jason)

Gee, you look awful.

I think you need to play some chess.



(Whizzer)

Jason, sit down and begin.



(Jason)

I'll let you win, Whizzer.

I'll let you win.

I'll let you win.
