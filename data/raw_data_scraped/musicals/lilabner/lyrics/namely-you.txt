Namely You


[Daisy Mae]

You deserve a gal who's willin, namely me

One who'd love to have your chil'en, namely me

Standin' there in the doorway waitin', at the close of day

With you all the way, to love, honor, and obey.



You deserve two arms to hold you, namely mine

There to comfort and enfold you, rain or shine

I deserve someone strong and handsome,

Bashful and shy, and true,

And I know just the one who'd do, namely you.



[Abner]

You deserve someone good lookin', namely me

Someone who as yet ain't tooken, namely me

That is how I'll remain unless you

Get me, shall we say,

In the family way,

Next Sadie Hawkins day



You craves arms to make you tingle, namely mine

To a bachelor who's single, that sounds fine

Come the day I no longer bachel, natcherly I'll be true

[Together]

And who could I be truest to? Namely you.
