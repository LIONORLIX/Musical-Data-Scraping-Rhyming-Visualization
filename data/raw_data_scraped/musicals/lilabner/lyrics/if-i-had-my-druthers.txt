If I Had My Druthers


If I had my druthers,

I'd druther have my druthers

Than anything else I know

While you'd druther hustle

accumulatin' muscle

I'd druther watch daisies grow.



While they're growin' slowin'

'n the summer breeze is blowin'

My heart is overflowin' 'n so;

If I had my druthers

I'd druther have my druthers

than anything else I know.



If I had my druthers,

I'd druther have my druthers

Than work do any work at all.

It ain't that I hates it,

I often contemplates it

while watchin' the rain drops fall



I sits there for hours,

developin' my powers

a figurin' how flowers gets tall

If I had my druthers

I'd druther have my druthers

than anything else at all.



Dogpatch Guy 1 (spoken): Say, Abner if you could be anyone else in the whole world, who'd you druther be?

Abner: (spoken) Me.

Guy1: (spoken) Jus' you?

Abner: (spoken) Jus' me.

Dogpatch Guy2: (spoken) What's so special 'bout being you?

Abner: (spoken) Ain't nuthin' special about it, it's just so handy, that' all.



If I had my druthers

To choose from all the others,

I'd druther be like I am.

This thing called employment

Detracts from my enjoyment,

And tightens my diaphragm.

While I'm doing nary

A thing that's necessary

I'm happy as a cherry-stone clam.



If I had my druthers

To choose from all the others,

I'd druther be like I am

Yes ma'am

I'd druther be like I am.
