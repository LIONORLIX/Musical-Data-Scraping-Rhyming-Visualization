Put 'Em Back


Put 'em back

the way they wuz

oh, put 'em back the way they wuz.

They was dumb, they was heathen,

but at least they was breathin,

so whatever else you does,



Put 'em back the way they wuz!

Put 'em back [put em back]

The way they wuz [the way they wuz]

oh, put 'em back the way they wuz!



They was plumb unattractive,

but by gum, they was active,

so I beg you kindly 'cause,

put 'em back the way they wuz!



Put 'em back [put 'em back]

The way they wuz [they way they wuz]

oh, put 'em back the way they wuz!



They was not known for beauty,

but they sho done they duty,

and they made the boudior buzz!

Put 'em back the way they wuz!

They was long, lean, and lanky,

but they loved hanky-panky

they did things that outdone duz!

Put 'em back the way they wuz!

They wuz vile lookin' varments

wearing vile lookin' garments

but they knowed a his from huz...

put 'em back the way they wuz!



Put 'em back [put 'em back]

The way they wuz [they way they wuz]

oh, put 'em back the way they wuz!



They was no shakes as lovers,

but they warmed up the covers,

covered as they wuz with fuzz!



Put 'em back the way they wuz!
