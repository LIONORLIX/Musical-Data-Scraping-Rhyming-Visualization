Unnecessary Town


Oh it's unnecessary

Just a speck on the map

Where the trail from the Smokies

Reaches old Gopher Gap

With the sheep in the meadow

And the bees in the comb

Oh, it's unnecessary

But it's home, sweet home



Oh it's unnecessary

Just a small little town

With the wind in the willows

And the moon beaming down

It's almost like a postcard

Done in pure kodachrome

Oh it's unnecessary

But it's home, sweet home



With the sheep in the meadow

And the bees in the comb

Oh, it's unnecessary

But it's home, sweet home
