The Country's In The Very Best Of Hands


Them city folks and we-uns

Are pretty much alike

Though they ain't used to living in the sticks

We don't like stone or cement

But we is in agreement

When we get started talking politics



The country's in the very best of hands

The best of hands

The best of hands



The treasury says the national debt

Is climbing to the sky

And government expenditures

Have never been so high

It makes a fellow get a

Gleam of pride within his eye,

To see how our economy expands

The country's in the very best of hands



The country's in the very best of hands

The best of hands

The best of hands



You oughtta hear the senate

When they're  drawing up a bill

Whereases  and Towits are crowded in each codicil

Such legal terminology

Would give your heart a thrill

There's phrases there that no one understands

The country's in the very best of hands



The building boom, they say

Is getting bigger every day

And when I asked a feller

How could everybody pay

He come up with an answer

That made everything okay

Supplies are getting greater than demands

The country's in the very best of hands



Don't you believe them congressmen

And senators are dumb

When they run into problems

That is tough to overcome

They just declare a thing

They calls a  moratorium

The upper and the lower house disbands

The country's in the very best of hands



The voters is connected to the nominee

The nominee's connected to the treasury

When he ain't connected to the treasury

He sits around on his thigh bone



He sits around in this place they got,

This big congressional parking lot

Just sits around on the you know what

Up there they calls 'em their thigh bone



Them bones, them bones

Gonna rise again

Gonna excercise a franchise again

Gonna tax us up to our eyes again

When he gets them off of their thigh bone



The country's in the very best of hands

The best of hands

The best of hands



The farm bill should be

Eight-nine percent parity

Another fellow recommends

It should be ninety-three.

But eighty, ninety-five percent who cares about degree

It's parity that no one understands

The country's in the very best of hands



Them GOP's and democrats

Each hates the other one

They's always criticizing

How the country should be run

But neither tell the public

What the others gone and done

As long as no one knows

Where no one stands

The country's in the very best of hands



They sits around in this place they're at,

Where folks in congress has always sat

Just sits around on their excess fat,

Up there they calls 'em their thigh bones



They sits around till they starts to snore

Jumps up and hollers

I has the floor

Then sits right down where they sats before

Up there they calls it their thigh bone



Them bones, them bones

Gonna rise again,

So dignified and so wise again

While the budget doubles in size again

When it gets them off of their thigh bone



The country's in the very best of hands

The best of hands

The best of hands



The money that they taxes us

That's known as revenue

They compound up collaterals

Subtracts the residue



Don't worry about the principal

And interest it incrues

They're shipping all that stuff to foreign lands

The country's in the very best of hands
