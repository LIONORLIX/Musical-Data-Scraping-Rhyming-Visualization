It's A Typical Day


Soloists: It's a typical day

In Dogpatch, USA.

Where typical folks

Do things in a typical way.

First we rubs the sleep from our eyes,

Get's our grub, and shoos 'way the flies.

We spend what's negotiable,

Then we gets sociable,

Sittin' around swappin' lies!

And then we drops by to collect unemployment pay!



All: Which leads us to say it's a typical day

In Dogpatch, USA!



Lonesome Polecat: Lonsome Polecat, Indian Brave!

Hairless Joe: Hairless Joe, me needum a shave!

Both: We livin' an' sleepin' n' doin' housekeepin' in big subterranian cave!

While Kickapoo Joy Juice we makeum is heap "grade A!"



Skraggs: Take us boys what's known as the Skraggs,

Mammy said she had us as gags!

Can't git that depressin' an' homely unlessin' ya comes from a long line o' hags!

There ain't any widders or orphans we won't betray!



Moonbeam: Howdy boys, I'm Moonbeam McSwine,

Sleepin' out with the pigs is my line.

The fellas admire me,

But they don't squire me

Unless the weather is fine!

But I does allright when the wind blows the other way!

Daisy Mae:Like he said, my name's Daisy Mae!

Cuz my ma, she planned it that way.

My one aim in life is to be a good wife,

And marry Li'l Abner someday!

She ain't never caught Li'l Abner, but she's got hopes!

And she heads the local machine.

Mammy: I'se sweet but I'se mystical,

And pugilistical,

Both: Li'l Abner we has both learned,

Still don't know how money gets earned.

His heart is the tenderest,

But neuter-genderest,

Far as young gals is concerned!

Abner: I gets purty tired of runnin' from Daisy Mae!
