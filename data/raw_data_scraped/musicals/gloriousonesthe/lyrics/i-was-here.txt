I Was Here


I've gone without bread

I've slept in the mud

I've given my best

While they screamed for my blood

I've begged and I've bullied

For any small chance to perform



And nights I've awakened

My guts in a knot

Remembering how much I gave up

And for what?

Some paints and some costumes

A pitiful tent in a storm



A handful of coins

A trunk always packed

No family, no home

Just this madness to act



Still I have a theory

About this disease we contract...

That most men are equally crazy

As actors, in fact



Why does a boy carve his name on a tree

Or the first born inherit the throne?

What is a sculptor aspiring to be

When he spends half his life carving stone?



Kings built their tombs for the ages

Poets and fools fill up their pages

What are we hoping for?

What do we fear?



I say we yearn to leave something that lasts

And be known for what little we've done

Men tell their children the tales of their past

And each man gives his name to his son



Something in song or in story

Something in blood, something of glory

Something that won't fade away in a year



Well, I will not flicker, and die like an ember

Do many man flicker and die?

I will leave something behind to remember

Somehow I must, don't ask me why.



I have no sons, at least none I can claim

And no patience for carving in stone

All that I have are my skill and my name

And this chance to make both of them known



This is my key to the portal

How I can leave something immortal

Something that time cannot make disappear

Something to say 'I was here'
