Tell us of this age old scene.

Boy meets girl.

Boy gets dumped.

Boy then takes a headlong dive.



Leaving all the critics stumped,

Boy comes back from death alive!

Girl's upset.

Boy's perplexed.

No one knows what happens next.

Seems his happy ending

Is...

...pending.



Stage manager:

Ramona and the motorwise guys:

Now jonny's feeling low, folks.

Returned, he's found his life's a catastrophe.

He's landed in the soup.

As ours is too

For serving...

You!

Eddie:

So you say your girl's in a stew, jonny boy,

Put off by your toxic veneer.

So you say it's probably through, jonny boy.

But where do you go from here?

Where do you go from here?



Jonny:

(stammering)

Well, i...



Onstage announcer:

We'll be back for that answer after this brief commercial

Message!  And here's ramona merengue with a word from true blue

Cigarettes -- now with breath-freshening menthol!!



Ramona:

True blue --

Only one nickel a box....

True blue --

Filtered for your health.



Eddie:

Hey you!  Sweetheart!  You know this place?



Stage manager:

"our lady of divine masochism?"



Eddie:

It's a catholic orphanage.  I need the phone number.



Stage manager:

What do i look like?  Your errand boy?  Do it yourself.



Ramona:

There's nothing like a true blue smoke!



I love a true blue...

(cough)

...man!



Eddie:

(back on the air)

So the question, mr. Warner,

Now that push has come to shove --

Should you go on chasing dreams,

Or should you say good-bye to love?
