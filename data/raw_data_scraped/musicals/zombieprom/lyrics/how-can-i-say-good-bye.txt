How Can I Say Good-Bye


Jonny:

(taking the microphone and facing the camera)

How can i say good-bye to love...?

Oh...oh...oh...

Perish the very thought.

How can i say good-bye to love,

When love is all i've got?

Toffee, i'll see it through,

Cause baby, i fought back hell for you.

Oh, i'll never say good-bye-eeii-eeii to love!



Motorwise guys:

(jumping in)

His skin is green.

His mood is blue.

How can he say,

Say good-bye to you-oo?



Jonny:

How can i say good-bye, my dear?

How can i not be true?

How can i wipe away this tear,

When it's been shed for you?



When there's no girl for me,

What good is an eternity?

Oh, i'll never say good-bye-eeii-eeii to love!



Jonny:

Think back on all the love we shared,

All that our hearts possessed.

Tell me it hasn't changed for good,

Since i was laid to rest.

Till death do us part,

She took right to heart!



How can i say good-bye to you?



How can i leave you, dear?



How can i say farewell, we're through,



When you're what brought me here?



Say that you'll be my wife.

Say that you'll share my afterlife.

Oh, i'll never cease to try for  oh!

You, who i live and die for.

I'll never say good-bye-eeii-eeii



To love.



Guys:

Ooh!  Ooh!  Ooh!



Ooh!  Ooh!  Ooh!

Ahh!  Ahh!

Ahh!  Ahh!  Ahh!

Till death do us part,

She took right to heart!



How can he say goodbye?

How can he say goodbye?

How can he leave you?

How can he leave you?

How can he say goodbye?

How can he say goodbye?

How can he leave you?

How can he leave you?



Ooh!

Ooh!

Oh! He'll never cease to try.

Oh! Baby it's do or die.

Oh! He'll never say goodbye.

Oh!  Yi-yi-yi-yi-yi

To love.



Jonny and the motorwise guys:

To love.

To love.

To love!
