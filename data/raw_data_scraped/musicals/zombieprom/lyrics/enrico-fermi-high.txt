Enrico Fermi High


Toffee and girls:

Wake up ev'ry morning,

So much stuff to learn.

Histories of this and that,

Latin verbs and habitat,

Principles of bacon fat.

The time

Flies by.



Toffee:

It's another day.



Toffee and girls:

It's just another day

At enrico fermi high.

It's just another day....



Jonny and boys:

Wake up ev'ry morning.

Get those wheels to turn.

Strategies from foreign wars,

Algebra and baseball scores,

Pi-r-squared,

And two-by-fours.

The hours

Roll by.



Jonny:

It's another day.



Jonny and boys:

It's just another day

At enrico fermi high.



Candy:

Physics exam today, toffee.



Toffee:

I know, candy.



Candy:

I was so worried last night, i chewed my nails raw. Wanna see?



Ginger, toffee and coco:

No!



Coco:

Hey, toffee, i saw chuck last night at burger in a basket. With sheila.



Candy:

Sheila?



Coco:

You know...sheila. Too much make-up, not enough underwear...?



Candy & toffee:

Ah!



Ginger:

Now, ladies, do you really think this is appropriate conversation for school?



Candy:

Does that bother you, toffee? About chuck i mean?



Toffee:

No, that's ok. We weren't serious. I mean it wasn't real love.



Ginger:

What's real love like?



Toffee:

I don't know yet. But i'll tell you when i get there.



Kids:

Wake up ev'ry morning,

Start the day's routine.

Student council, teacher's pets,

Marching bands with clarinets,

Minor keys and major-ettes.

Another day,

It's just another day

At enrico fermi high....



Miss strict:

(entering)

Mr. Warner. I couldn't help noticing that the name on your jacket is missing a letter.



Jonny:

I know, miss strict. I'm spelling it without the "h" now. "jon without an h warner."



Miss strict:

Do you really think that's wise?

Defiling a good christian name like that? No, no. Change it back, johnny.



Jonny:

I...i think i want to keep the "h" out.



Kids:

Oooooh.



Miss strict:

Well, if that's your decision... Just know i don't stand for hoodlums around here.

That's "hoodlums," jonny.

With an h! Get to class, everyone!



Jake:

(as miss strict exits.)

Whoa! You are so...different.



Rebel without an h!



Jake, jonny and kids:

Yeah, yeah, yeah,

Rebel without an h!



All:

Wake up ev'ry morning,

Face that age old scene.

Crossing guards and hallways pests,

Sloppy joes and english tests,



Girls:

Saddle shoes,



Boys:

And padded chests!



Girls:

Another day...



Boys:

It's just another day.



Girls:

It's an another day...



All:

It's just another day,

At enrico fermi....
