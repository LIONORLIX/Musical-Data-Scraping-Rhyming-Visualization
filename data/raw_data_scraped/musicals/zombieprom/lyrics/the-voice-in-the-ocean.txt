The Voice in the Ocean


Jonny:

I was rotting in a watery grave,

Lying in my coffin below,

When i heard a voice from up above

Saying "jonny, i love you so!

Hey, jonny, i love you so!"



I was happy in a weird sorta way,

Thinkin' it's a good way to go.

But i couldn't shake that voice i heard

Saying, "jonny, i love you so!

Jonny, i love you so!"



The voice in the ocean

That called through the black,

That voice told me, "jonny,

It's time to come back."

The voice in the ocean

Said, "that's what you do."

And i knew that the voice,

Yes, it's true that the voice

Was you.



Toffee:

Are you telling me the tears that i shed

Touched you in the sea from above?

Are you saying, jonny, that you've been

Brought back by the pow'r of love?

Brought back by the pow'r of love?



The voice in the ocean

That rang in your head,

That sang through and got you

To rise from the dead,

The voice in the ocean

That called through the sea,

Oh, you knew that the voice,

Yes, it's true that the voice

Was me.



Both:

How, how did this come to pass?

How, how could we know?

I feel this yen

To try again,

But oh --

How do we start...?



Jonny:

Now that death has blown us farther apart?



Toffee:

The voice in the ocean

That rang in your head,

That sang through and got you

To rise from the dead,

The voice in the ocean

That called through the sea,

Oh, you knew that the voice,

Yes, it's true that the voice

Was me.

Oh, it was me.

It was me.

It was me.



Jonny:

The voice in the ocean,

Rang in my head...



Rise from the dead,

The voice in the ocean

That called through the sea,

Yes, i knew that the voice,

Yes, it's true that the voice  yes,

Was you.

Oh, it was you.

Oh, it was you.

It was you.
