Zombie Prom


Miss strict:

After all...this is a prom!



All:

Magic surrounds us.

Don't you see?

This love is destined to be.

Destined to be...

This love is destined to be!



Here's to us.

Here's to us.

Here's to all we have in store.

Here's to you.

Here's to me.

You made my life worth living for.

From eve and adam,

To the atom bomb,

Here's to all the years ahead,

And to our zombie prom!



Toffee:

When i was a little girl

I used to fantasize,

Satin dress and satin gloves,

Mascara on my big brown eyes.

Life was perfect in that world,

Pretty as you please.

Now i see, dreams are dreams.

Here's to real life fantasies!



Jonny:

When i was a little boy,

My dreams were bright and bold.

Racing cars and chasing hopes,

Reaching out to grab the gold.

Then i was a teenaged corpse;

My soul it never died.

Can't give up, can't lie down,

Life can still be worth the ride!



It's a tough world out there, toffee.



Toffee:

I don't care, jonny.



Jonny:

I don't know if i can promise you much of a future.



(eyeing the audience)



There are bound to be a lot of people out there who won't accept us as a couple.



Toffee:



(taking two steps forward and addressing the audience)



I know that.  But i also like to think that there are people who will understand our love.

And no matter what the future brings...we'll always have each other!  Thank you.



Both:

Here's to all the years ahead,

And to our zombie prom!



Kids:

Memories are little more

Than moments in the stream.

Live the moments while you can,

And thank the lord you had your dream.

Jonny & toffee:

Moments and their memories

Are all that life leads to.

Live them,

Laugh them off,

And start your life anew!



Eddie & miss strict:

Here's to us.

Kids:

Here's to us.

Eddie & miss strict:

Here's to us.

Kids:

Here's to us.

Eddie & miss strict:

Here's to all we have in store.

Kids:

All we have in,

Have in store.

Eddie & miss strict:

Here's to you.

Kids:

Here's to you.

Eddie & miss strict:

Here's to me.

Kids:

Here's to me.

All:

You made my life worth living for.

From eve to adam,

To the atom bomb.

Here's to all the years ahead,

And to our zombie prom.



Here's to high school, how it flies.

To the bonds and to the ties.

To the love that never dies.

And to our zombie prom!

Zombie prom!



The end
