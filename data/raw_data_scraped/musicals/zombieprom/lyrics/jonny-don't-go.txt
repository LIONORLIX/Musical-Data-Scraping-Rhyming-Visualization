Eddie flagrante reporting for expose magazine.

Shocking news this week, america -- small town,

Rebellious teen, jonny warner committed suicide early the morning of the fourteenth by hurling himself

Headlong into the main waste treatment silo of the francis gary powers nuclear plant. Jonny, who

Spelled his name without the customary h, was said to have taken his life in the name of teen love.

A tragic case of a hormonal imbalance resulting in a class three nuclear disaster...



(the scene shifts to the chemistry lab.)



Candy:

Hey, toffee. Why the "grumpy face?"



Toffee:

Oh...no reason...



Coco:

You didn't seem yourself at pep squad today.



Ginger:

And you dropped your baton three times at twirling practice.



Toffee:

Sorry, girls, i guess i just have my mind on...other things.



Ginger, candy, coco:

Tell us about it, toffee.



Toffee:

Three weeks ago

I told him we were through.

I did what my parents said to do.

They said "enough,"

Said he was no good.

He wasn't bad.

He was just misunderstood.





Toffee:

Three weeks ago

We said our good-byes.

I saw there were tears in his eyes.

Deep down i wished

He'd make things all right.

But he shook his head,

And he drove into the night...







And i screamed...



Jonny don't go

To the nuclear plant!

Jonny don't go

To the nuclear plant!

I wish i could stop you

But you know i can't.

Jonny don't go,

Jonny don't go...

Girls









Ooh!

Ooh!

Aah!

Aah!

Sha la la la

La la la la

La la la la la!









Whoa, whoa, no!





(one of the chemistry projects explodes.)



Toffee:

To the nuclear plant!



Three weeks ago

They took my guy from me.



And buried his body deep at sea.



As he sailed off,

I knew my dreams were through.

The sun, it set,

Upon my ocean blue....







Jonny don't go

To the nuclear plant!

Jonny don't go

To the nuclear plant!

I wish i could stop you

But you know i can't.

Jonny don't go...

But you know i can't.
