Trio (Case Closed)


Eddie:

Ok, zombie boy!  Time to face the press....



Miss strict:

(marching onstage)

And another thing, mr. Warner....



(eddie and miss strict spot each other and are thunderstruck.)



Eddie:

Delilah strict!?

Miss strict:

Eddie flagrante!?

Both:

It's been a very long time...!



(oblivious of everything, they begin to move toward each other as if in a trance, when...)



Josh:

You two know each other?



Miss strict:

(straightening up and hissing at the kids)

Get to class!  All of you!



Eddie:

It's been many years, delilah.

Always knew we'd meet again.

Never knew exactly where

And not a clue as to the when.



Miss strict:

After all you put me through,

The tragic scene that came to play,

After all that happened then....

Eddie:

What?

Miss strict:

Well, i...

I don't have time for this today!



Eddie:

(indicating jonny)

So i see.

What's the scoop?

There's no limit to the depths to which i'll stoop!



Miss strict:

What we have here is an issue

With a controversial bent.

If i break once with tradition

I'll have set a precedent.



If we let him come to roost here

Then this zombie clique will thrive.

And he wasn't all that special

Even when he was alive.



Case is closed,

Shut air tight.

It's all there as plain as day in black and white!



Eddie:

Well, i hate to disagree, love,

But this stinks to holy heights.

You're denying him his due.

This is a case of civil rights!



He belongs!

Miss strict:

Don't be dense!

Eddie:

God, you're gorgeous when you're tense....

Jonny:

May i speak in my defense...?



Here's the situation, ma'am,

I'm talking honest pool.

I just want an education, ma'am.

I want to go to school.

Looks can be deceiving, ma'am,

Well, what with all i did.

Beneath all the trauma

I'm still just a kid.

Eddie:

Beneath all the trauma

He's still just a kid.



Jonny:

One more point concerning

How my character's in doubt;

I'm planning on returning,

While the norm is dropping out.

I have no hope of leaving, ma'am,

I thought you understood.

Beneath all the gangrene

I'm basically good.

Eddie:

Beneath all the gangrene

He's basically good.



Miss strict:

Rule number 7,

Subsection 9,

Of the handbook of student life says --

No zombies!

No zombies!

Get that through your head.

No monsters!

No mutants!

No satanic walking dead!



Eddie:

Deli...

Miss strict:

Hey!

Eddie:

"miss strict," i mean,

Let's be honest here.

Put our cards out on the table.

Let us persevere.

Jonny:

I want to come back!

Miss strict:

And i won't let you!

Eddie:

Well, that's clear.



(to himself)

What we have here is a candidate

For hero of the day.

He could eas'ly be the cover-boy

For next week's expose'.



But beyond the fame and glory

There's a point here to be made.

Equal rights for the undead

Could be a national crusade!



I'm the match.

He's the fuse.

Put together, we could make the network news!



Miss strict:

(to eddie)

Heaven knows how first he got here,

But he's leaving through that door.

If this freak wants his diploma

That's what cath'lic schools are for.



Jonny:

All i want

Is a break.

After all i've got my afterlife at stake...



(all sung simultaneously)



Jonny:

Here's the situation, ma'am,

I'm talking honest pool.

I just want an education, ma'am.

I want to go to school.

Looks can be deceiving, ma'am,

Well, what with all i did.

Beneath all the trauma

I'm still just a kid.

Miss strict:

No zombies!

No zombies!

Get that through your head.

No monsters!

No mutants!

No satanic walking dead!

Eddie:

What we have here is a candidate

For hero of the day.

He could eas'ly be the cover-boy

For next week's expose'.

No zombies!

All:

Heaven only knows where this will

Lead to when exposed --

Eddie:

Top story!

Jonny:

My future!

Miss strict:

No zombies!

All:

Case closed!!
