Ain't Goin' Back


Ginger

Under the table, toffee!



Jonny

Toffee, toffee...



Josh

C'mon, jonny. All fours!



Toffee

Jonny, jonny...



One moment with you

And i suddenly know

The difference one moment can make.

Jonny

The rush of the lunchroom,

The sirens, the glow,

The smell of the...sal'sbury steak.

Both

Magic surrounds us.

Don't you see?

This love is destined to be.



Kids

It's another day,

It's just another day....



Toffee

Homecoming dance coming up, jonny.



Jonny

I don't know, toffee. I've never been to a dance before. I wouldn't know how.



Toffee

And i would? I just...i just want everyone to know you're with me...



The days turn to weeks,

Still our love doesn't stop.

The months turn from summer to fall.

Jonny

We pour out our hearts

In the notes that we swap,

In glances exchanged in the hall.



Both

Magic surrounds us.

Don't you see?

This love is destined to be.



Kids

It's another day,

Another day...



Toffee

And i know we said we wouldn't exchange gifts...but i want you to have this.



Jonny

You shouldn't have. Oh, but i'm glad you did. 'Cause i want you to have this.

(holding out his jacket to her) go on. Take it.



Toffee

Jonny! It's your "no h" jacket! Are you asking me to go steady?



Jonny

I'm not good with speeches, toffee. I grew up an orphan.

I didn't have all the things the other kids had.

No mom, no dad...no fancy birthday parties with ice cream and cake....



Toffee

Oh, jonny...



Jonny

You're the first person who's ever loved me. It would kill me to think this wasn't forever.



Toffee

Oh, jonny. Of course i'll go steady with you.

I love you! And there's nothing that can ever change

That!



Both

As boundless as the heavens,

Eternal as the soul,

As destined as the sunset

When the credits start to roll.

As certain as the starlight

When the day has gone to black.

Yes, it's said and done.

Our souls are one.

And there ain't no goin' back,

No, no, there ain't no goin' back.

There ain't no goin' back!



Kids

It's another day...



Candy

Oh, gosh, toff! Couldn't you die?! One more semester and we're out for good.

I'm holding on by my fingernails, toffee! By my fingernails! Wanna see?



Jonny and toffee

As boundless as the heavens,



Eternal as the soul,



As destined as the sunset



When the credits start to roll.



As certain as the starlight



When the day has gone to black.

Yes, it's said and done.

Our souls are one.



And there ain't no goin' back, no, no, there

Ain't no goin' back.

There ain't no goin' back,

No, no there ain't no goin' back.

There ain't no goin back...!

Kids



D'you hear the latest?



Jonny and toffee...



They're goin' steady!



Over a month now!



Ain't it the greatest?

Oh,

Yes, it's said and done.

Their souls are one.



Ain't no goin' back.

Ain't no goin' back.

Ain't no goin' back.

Ain't no goin' back.

Ain't no goin' back...!
