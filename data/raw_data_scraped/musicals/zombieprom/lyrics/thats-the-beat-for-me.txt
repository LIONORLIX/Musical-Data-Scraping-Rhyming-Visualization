Thats the Beat for Me


Eddie:

"expose',"

Cries the usa,

And the hypocrites keep low.

Nothing in the bill of rights

Supersedes the public's right to know.

Where there's a scandal on the rise

I'll be around to scrutinize,

Printing the facts behind the lies --

That's the beat for me!



"have you heard?"

Sings a little bird

Who whispers in my ear.

Some movie star was spotted at a motel 6

With a well known mouseketeer!

Celebrity heros, clean as wax,

Or hollywood nymphomaniacs?

America need to know the facts --

That's the beat for me!



(to a group of entering secretaries)

You're late!



Secretaries:

Sorry.



Eddie:

Colleagues sometimes call me trash.

Hey, sometimes i agree.

Give me psycho killer moms

And i'm in ecstasy.

All the dirt that's fit to fling;

That's my strategy!

Secret desires of man and wife,

Private affairs and public strife.

Tamer than "playboy" but bigger than "life" --

That's the beat for me!



Josh:

(running in)

Eddie flagrante?!!



Eddie:

Coffee.  No sugar, no cream.  Black, black, black.

Something strong and ancient.  I wanna taste the grounds, you got me?



Josh:

No, but that's not why...



Eddie:

Oh, yeah!  And a donut...something with sprinkles would be nice.



Josh:

Mr. Flagrante, don't you remember me?  Josh, from enrico fermi high.



Eddie:

Oh, yeah!  Cub reporter from the "fermi gazette."

Hey, kid i wanted to thank you for the dirt on that hood who took the dive into the nuclear plant.

Great story!  Huge story!  Important!  Tragic!  Passionate!  Off the stands by noon.



Josh:

Well, it ain't over yet.  He's back!



Eddie:

He's back?  What are you talking about?  He's dead.

He was buried at sea, in international waters.....



Josh:

He's come back from the dead.  Jonny warner is a nuclear zombie!



Eddie:

A teenage nuclear zombie!  Are you serious about this?



Josh:

Would i make this up?



Eddie:

I smell paydirt!  Hey, you wanna be a reporter, right, kid?

Well, what are you standing around for?  We got us a story to crack!



Eddie/josh/copy boys/secretaries:

Tamer than "playboy" but bigger than "life" --

Eddie:

That's the beat for me!



Josh/secretaries/copy boys:

Warts and all,

Who's the man to call

When a story rears its head?



Eddie:

Me!  Me!  Me!





Josh/secretaries/copy boys:

Senators and prostitutes and prison guards...



Eddie:

And now the walking dead!



Josh/secretaries/copy boys:

Yeah, yeah, yeah!



Eddie:

"lovesick senior in the green?"



Josh/secretaries/copy boys:

Naw!



Eddie:

"the miracle of the toxic teen!"



Josh/secretaries/copy boys:

Yeah!



All:

All in expose' magazine --



Eddie:

That's the beat for...

All:

Yeah!

Yeah!
