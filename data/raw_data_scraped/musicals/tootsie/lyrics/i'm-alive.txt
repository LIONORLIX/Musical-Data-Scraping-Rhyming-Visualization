I'm Alive


JULIE NICHOLS:

On my back

In my bed

It was dark

I was dead



Couldn't move

Couldn’t walk

Couldn't breathe

And I sure couldn't talk



No more dusk

No more dawn

This was it

I was gone (No!)



But then low

There’s a light

And surprise, surprise

I open my eyes



I'm alive

I'm alive

Good god almighty

I'm alive



Don't hold your nose

I won't decompose

I smell like a rose

I'm alive



My world (She's alive)

Was a dud (She’s alive)

Lots of death (She’s alive)

Lots of blood (Blood)



So my life (She's alive)

I would take (She’s Alive)

But now I'm thinking

It's a big mistake



I'm alive

I’m alive

Hallelujah

I'm alive



The birds and the bees

And the sun and the trees

And the wine and the cheese



ENSEMBLE:

She's alive, she's alive

She was almost dead

But she's alive (Alive)



JULIE NICHOLS:

What can I say

I got carried away

But now's a new day

I'm alive



RON CARLISLE:

Extenuated Movement, people

Bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce

Five, six, seven, eight

Fosset, fosset, fosset, fosset



Brain freeze!

The floor is lava

It's hot! Hot! Hot! Hot!

It's hot hot hot hot hot



Happy Bunny

Funny Bunny

Frightened Bunny

In the hole

Where's the bunny?

Where's the bunny?

He's got a fidget spinner, go!



Bye Felicia!

Take a selfie, be a hater, Lap Dance

Turn it out, reel 'em in



JULIE NICHOLS:

I'm alive

I'm alive

I can't believe it (alive)

I'm alive (alive)



MAX VAB HORN:

Here's the headline

She's gonna be mine



JULIE NICHOLS:

I really dodged the bullet

All the plumbing's working

Thank god you didn't bury me

Because I'm alive



ENSEMBLE:

Alive, alive, alive, alive

We can't overstate it

You're not cremated

It's really really

Great that you're

Alive
