Jeff Sums It Up


JEFF SLATER:

Not long ago, there was a man

An angry guy, awkwardly aging [?]

A self-destructive whining his way

Through life 'till ambition



In circumstance

Conspired to deliver an opportunity

No one except a megalomaniacal actor

With nothing to really lose would consider

So then, of course, this guy puts

Oh, yeah, this guy is you, in case you were wondering

Puts on a dress, a wig, heels and actually gets the part

And surprisingly, everything goes very well

But then, and how do I say it, you fucked it up

You really fucked it up



You got applause, you got the fame

Except it wasn't exactly for you

And now you're in love with a girl

Who thinks you're somebody that you're not

And in case you forgot, I'll tell you who you really are

You're the guy who fucked it up

You really fucked it up



Listen, Mike, I know when Mr. Opportunity

Comes tip-toeing and teasing

You're the kind of man who grabs him by the balls

But then when he screams and says

Let go of my balls!

You just keep on squeezing

Well, that's the time you gotta...



I lost my train of thought

Hmm... But anyway, you get the point

You screwed the pouch! Epic Fail!

I hate to say I'm happy to say I told you so

But it makes me so happy

I told you so!

I told you so!

I told you so!

You fucked it up

You really fucked it up



JEFF: (spoken)

You went tits-up



MICHAEL:

I went tits-up



JEFF:

Mistakes were made



MICHAEL:

Mistakes were made



JEFF:

You bit the dirt



MICHAEL:

I bit the dirt



JEFF:

Insane in the membrane



MICHAEL:

Good song



JEFF:

A major malfunction



MICHAEL:

I really blew it



JEFF:

[?]



MICHAEL:

[?]



JEFF:

You messed it up



MICHAEL:

I did



JEFF & MICHAEL:

The wheels came off your bumper car (The wheels came off my bumper car)



[?]

...

[?]



MICHAEL: (spoken)

Jeff! Jeff! Jeff!



JEFF:

Jazz square, Jazz hands



MICHAEL: (spoken)

Shhhhh



DOROTHY: (spoken)

Hello? Hi!

Oh! Oh yes, great!

Thank you!



MICHAEL: (spoken)

Jeff!

The cast are going over to hear Julie sing and they invited Dorothy.

Now Julie has been avoiding me since I kissed her.

But she also confines in Dorothy what she wants from a guy.

Right?

So if I can meet Julie as Michael

I can use those things to get her to fall for me.

And then fix things between her and Dorothy



JEFF:

Good luck to you!

God bless you Mike

I really really wish you the best

I'll tell you what I'm coming along

For moral support

Because I'm a friend

But mostly because I'm curious

To see exactly how you'll fuck it up
