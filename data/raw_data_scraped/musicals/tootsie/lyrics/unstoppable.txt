Unstoppable


MICHAEL DORSEY:

Michael Dorsey the man

With the scheme

And the master plan

Couldn't beg, buy, or borrow his dream

But now Dorothy can



'Cuz she's got me flying like a bird

So how to describe it

Only one word

Unstoppable!



Stand aside 'cause this girl's on a roll

She's unstoppable!

Admiration, respect, and Control

She's unstoppable!



Half-cocked and down on my knees

Doors Locked

But suddenly she's

Right there beside me

And hands me the keys

She's unstoppable!

Unstoppable!



We got the role!

We got the gig!

We got control!

We're getting big!

We took the chance!

We took this town!

Told you before

Show me the door

I'll kick it down



When I put on the wig

And the dress I'm unflappable

You can't start to chime

Dorothy's success

It's unmappable!



ENSEMBLE:

Don't try to slow her down!



MICHAEL DORSEY:

Like the thrusts a hummingbird's tongue

Like a Bearcat that's blown out its bum

Like a hippo protecting her young

Unstoppable!



ENSEMBLE:

Unstoppable!

Unstoppable!

Unstoppable!



Look out world

Cuz this girl's on a roll

She's unstoppable!

Admiration, respect, and control

She's unstoppable!



Anywhere

Hollywood

Or Broadway

Any part

Any scene

Any play



Nothing and no one not anything

Anyone ever can do or say can stop her

Unstoppable!

Unstoppable!

Unstoppable!



DOROTHY MICHAELS:

I'll be taking the world over soon

Unstoppable!

No use trying to burst my balloon

Unpopable!

No more waiting

Cuz this is my time

There's no mountain

These hills can't climb

Nothing on earth can stop me

Cuz I'm

Unstoppable!



ENSEMBLE:

Unstoppable!

Unstoppable!

It is because of us



JULIE NICHOLS: (spoken)

Oh, this has turned out better

Than I ever could have imagined

I love you Dorothy

And I love you

Oh my god!
