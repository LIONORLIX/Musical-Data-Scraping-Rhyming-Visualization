Who Are You?


MICHAEL:

Somebody in the moonlight

Someone I think I know

Standing there like a shadow

Who are you?

I can't escape the feeling

I met you long ago

In someplace filled with sunlight

Who are you?

I've never been a needy or romantic guy

Falling like a meteor in some poetic starry sky

Who am I?

This is a different story

Something completely strange

What the hell am I doing?

Who are you?

Who are you?



JULIE: (spoken)

More wine?



MICHAEL (AS DOROTHY): (spoken)

Yes please. What?



JULIE: (spoken)

It's nice connecting with someone



JULIE:

Somebody I can talk to

Like someone I've always known

Where on earth were you hiding?

Who are you?

I think it's just amazing

How fast this friendship has grown

Someone I can confide in

Who are you?

It's felt so long since I was young and running free

I locked myself inside a box but suddenly

There's the key

Someone whose heart is open

Somebody I could love

Just like an older sister

Who are you?

Who are you?



MICHAEL & JULIE:

This is a different story

Something completely strange

What the hell am I doing?



I think it's just amazing

How fast this friendship has grown

Like the sister I never had



Who are you?

Who are you?

Who are you?
