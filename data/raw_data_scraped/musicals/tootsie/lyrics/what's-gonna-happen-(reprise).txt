What's Gonna Happen (Reprise)


I know what's gonna happen

Don't tell me that it's not

You'll call me up at nine

And say: "There's something you forgot"



Your brother is in jail

Your mom's been in a wreck

Your sister has a goiter

Like a football on her neck



You're gonna stand me up

And I'll be staring at the phone

Sitting there all dismal and pathetic and alone

And feeling just about as welcome

And as wanted as a kidney stone



I know what's gonna happen

You know what's gonna happen

We know what's gonna happen

We all know what'll happen

It never doesn't happen

It always has to happen

It's guaranteed it happens
