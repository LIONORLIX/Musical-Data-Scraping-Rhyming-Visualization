Talk to Me Dorothy


MICHAEL:

So here I am

Desperate and dizzy

Hanging by one hand

From the thinnest branch



Totally mixed up

Totally fed up

Riding the edge of the avalanche



I know how I got here

I know I've been stupid

I know it's my fault

But I could really use some help



What's it I want?

What was my hurry?

Drawn to the spotlight

But it's not the sun



Walking on ice

Loaded with worry

Is that what you finally get

Once your race is run?



So talk to me, Dorothy

You're smarter than I am

Tell me, why was I so hungry before?

Your waters run deeper

Deeper than mine

You've given me so much

And now i need more



Let me see through those eyes of yours

All of these people

All of these people you've helped me to love

Let me hear through your ears

And maybe this noise can turn into some kind of music



There's you

And there's me

With a heart you discovered

And hands that are steady and warm to the touch



So talk to me, Dorothy

You taught me how to sing

Can you help me, Dorothy?

I need you so much
