This Thing


MAX:

What is this thing I'm feeling?

Bubbling up inside me?

Lifting me toward the ceiling?

Dorothy, Dorothy, Dorothy, Dorothy, Dorothy



NEIGHBOR: (spoken)

Hey, shut up! People live here!



MAX:

What is this sound I'm hearing?

Is it a bell to guide me?

Out of thin air appearing?

Dorothy, Dorothy, Do-o-o-o-o-o-o--



NEIGHBOR: (spoken)

Hey! Shut up! Shut the fuck up!



MAX:

What is this thing that makes me toss in my bed

Cuz I'm racked with distracting desires

This thing, God it's jammed in my head

Like a nail and I can't find the pliers

Get it out, I exclaim

Then I think of your name

And I feel like a moth

Heading right for the female moth

That moth is you

What can I do?

What is this thing that I'm feeling?

It's odd. You're so old I'm so young

And my abs are like slabs of fine granite

My bod is like gold, and I'm hung

And you're old, oh I said that, but damn it

I don't care you're not thin

You're under my skin

I know something special's

About to be starting real soon

I'm over the moon

What is this thing?

What is this thing?

This thing has me worried and scared

But it's finally time to reveal it

It's right and it's big and it wants to be shared

And I need you to reach down and feel it

Yes I will love you forever

No I'm not bashful to prove it



MICHAEL (AS DOROTHY): (spoken)

Is that me?



MAX:

Yes it's a little infected

No I will never remove it

This thing will remain like a permanent stain

Like a voice that keeps taunting a haunting refrain

Like that wonderful spike that you drove in my brain

This thing

This thing

Called you
