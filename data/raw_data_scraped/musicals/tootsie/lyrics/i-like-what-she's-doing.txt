I Like What She's Doing


RITA MARSHALL:

I like what she's doing

This might be a thing

She's giving it feeling

She's making it sing

She's fun but profound

Let's not shove this down

I like what she's doing



What she's selling

I'm buying

It's something we need

I love that she's trying

Let's follow her lead

We were flat on our back

But now we're on track

She'll polish this turd

Into treasure somehow

Just maybe if Dorothy keeps doing

What she's doing now



(spoken)

Well, we got work to do

God knows how we got this far

But ready or not

We move into the theater tomorrow



CARL: (spoken)

Alright kiddos

It's your favorite stage manager, Carl

Break's over!

We're gonna rehearse

The new Juliet-Nurse scene

Everyone else, there is a revised

Schedule on the board

Don't forget to sign back in!

Dorothy, July, the stage is yours!



JULIE HALSTON: (spoken)

He saw your motionless hair

And your avocado figure

And I lost the man I loved



DOROTHY MICHAELS: (spoken)

To be fair, dear

You did kill the last one

Juliet, don't I deserve a chance

At a future that celebrates me?



Oh, this is really good!

Are you okay with all this?



JULIE HALSTON: (spoken)

Are you kidding?



(sung)

I love what we're saying

I'm smiling at last

It's great how we're playing

I'm having a blast

I trust you completely

So does the whole cast

We like what you're doing



She's got something special

That makes you engaged



JULIE HALSTON:

It's almost electric

When she hits the stage



RITA MARSHALL:

And I can't explain it

She's taking this turkey

And making it work



RITA MARSHALL & JULIE HALSTON & ?:

And I can't tell you how

But, honey, I hope she keeps doing

What she's doing now



DOROTHY MICHAELS: (spoken)

Rita, oh forget the renaissance

I'm thinking all new costumes

50's, feline, fabulous



RITA MARSHALL: (spoken)

Dorothy, I love it



RON CARLISLE:

She won't take directions

She's changing the play

She's like an infection

That won't go away



She just wants to fight me

She doesn't despise me

I hate what she's doing



It's very traumatic

I'm really upset

She's bringing up memories

I need to forget



She's stealing my girl

She's stealing my show

And I'm ready to blow

All because of that cow



Goddamnit!

She's gotta stop doing

What she's doing now



MAX VAN HORN: (spoken)

Ok, Max

New clothes, New lines

You got this!



JULIE HALSTON: (spoken)

If you take her

You better take care of her!



MAX VAN HORN: (spoken)

I will devote my life to her happiness

I love her



DOROTHY MICHAELS: (spoken)

Mean it!



MAX VAN HORN: (spoken)

I will devote my life to her happiness

I love her



DOROTHY MICHAELS: (spoken)

I don't believe it!



MAX VAN HORN: (spoken)

I will devote my life to her happiness

I love her!



DOROTHY MICHAELS: (spoken)

Well done max



MAX VAN HORN: (spoken)

Hey, I like what she's doing

She's got so much heart

She's so friggin sexy

And so frickin' smart



She's made me an actor

She's built like a tractor

I like what she's doing



ENSEMBLE:

We totally need her

I love her because

She's always a leader

Whatever she does



Something was missing

And she's what it was

I mean everyone's standing

When she takes her bows



God, really

I hope she keeps doing

What she's doing now



JULIE HALSTON: (spoken)

How will I live without you here?



DOROTHY MICHAELS: (spoken)

Happily, Juliet

Departing is such sweet sorrow



JULIE HALSTON: (spoken)

Then let's gather by the fountain

So we can all say arrivederci!



RITA MARSHALL: (spoken)

Dorothy, You have turned this show

Into a joyous anthem for all women

So, I am officially changing the title

From "Juliet's Curse" to "Juliet's Nurse"



DOROTHY MICHAELS:

I won't let you down

Because you believed in me

And now anybody can see

I'm really alive



I'll never let you down

I'm no longer empty inside

I filled up my cup

I never gave up



And now I can soar

To the heavens and higher



ENSEMBLE:

I hope she keeps doing

What she's doing right

Removing our tears

Relieving our fears



And when the smoke clears

We'll still have careers



So what's not to love?



DOROTHY MICHAELS:

I give you my word

I won't let you...



ENSEMBLE:

I like what she's doing



DOROTHY MICHAELS:

...down



ENSEMBLE:

I like what she's doing

What she's doing
