Arrivederci!


Goodbye!

Farewell!

And arrivederci nurse

So long my friend we love you

Hey do not forget your purse



We feel so bad you're going

And I bet you're gonna feel worse

[?], so long, and arrivederci nurse



(spoken) Let's sing her another verse!



So long!

Farewell!

Arrivederci [?]!

We really are gonna miss you

It's been a lot of fun



DOROTHY:

I'd like to stay forever

But it's time for me to run



ENSEMBLE:

Ok but you're making me want to cry

I ain't gonna lie, to say goodbye



Arrivederci!

Arrivederci!

Arrivederci!

Nurse!

Arrivederci!
