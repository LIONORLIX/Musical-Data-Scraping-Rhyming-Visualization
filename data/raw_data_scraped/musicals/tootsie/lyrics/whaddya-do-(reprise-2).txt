Whaddya Do (Reprise 2)


JEFF SLATER:

Whaddaya do when everything is happening

But everything that's happening

Has got you in distress



Whaddaya do when you're future calls

So grow yourself a pair of balls

And take those balls and put them in this dress



So your life is a joke

You think everything is broke

Well grab a roll of duct tape and some glue



Whaddaya gonna do

You're gonna fix your hair

And go out there

And be the man and woman that you are



MICHAEL DORSEY:

That's the only way to win

You gotta go all in



Well I'm all in



JEFF SLATER:

You're all in
