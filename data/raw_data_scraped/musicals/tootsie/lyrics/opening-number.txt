Opening Number


The night is falling on Manhattan

And soon the daylight will be gone

Anticipation's all around you

As one by one the lights are coming on



And your feet wanna fly

And your pulse wants to raise

'Cause your free and you're young

And you're in the right place



You're right here

You're right now

You're a part of New York

As the night comes alive

In the heart of New York



Nothing more exciting

Nowhere more delicious

Everything's inviting

Everything's the best

Every soul is soaring

Everyone's ambitious

No one here is boring

Nothing in the world

Is like the feeling



(spoken)

The feeling that

Anything is possible here

Even the impossible

Is possibly possible in



ENSEMBLE:

New York



(spoken)

You dream when you're awake

Any dream can be

A dream come true in



ENSEMBLE:

New York



MICHAEL DORSEY: (spoken)

Underneath this city that is all pavement

Is a city that's all heart



ENSEMBLE:

God, this is exciting

Don't you feel giddy

Man, there is nothing like it

Boy, this is the best



MICHAEL DORSEY: (spoken)

Stop



ENSEMBLE:

Now your light is shining



MICHAEL DORSEY: (spoken)

Stop



ENSEMBLE:

Wow, this is a city



MICHAEL DORSEY: (spoken)

Stop



RON CARLISLE: (spoken)

Stop



MICHAEL DORSEY: (spoken)

Ron Ron Ron



RON CARLISLE: (spoken)

Stop



MICHAEL DORSEY:

Ron



RON CARLISLE: (spoken)

Alright everybody

Let's all stop the rehearsal again

Because, because Mitchell has

Another compelling question



MICHAEL DORSEY: (spoken)

It's Michael, Dorsey

And would my character say

"The city is all heart"?

He is a traumatized war vet

Evicted from his rent-controlled apartment

During the sewage-baked heat of summer

All heart? I don't think so



RON CARLISLE: (spoken)

Where in the history of the printed Libretto

Does it say any of that?



MICHAEL DORSEY: (spoken)

It's the back story I gave him



RON CARLISLE: (spoken)

Backstory?

He, he doesn't even have a name

He's "Guy who walks by"



MICHAEL DORSEY: (spoken)

My character deserves his truth

I am just saying what every

Other actor on this stage

Is thinking



RON CARLISLE: (spoken)

Lovey, this is a Ron Carlisle show, my vision, me creating a living aggregate out of the imagination of nothing

You want out?

You're out



MICHAEL DORSEY: (spoken)

Of the whole song?



RON CARLISLE: (spoken)

Ha, of the whole show

Of any show I ever do

In the pantheon of ever

And then even after that

After that



MICHAEL DORSEY: (spoken)

This opening number is benign and dishonest

Directed by an inept, derivative hack

And this musical

Sucks



ENSEMBLE:

This is the tale of Michael Dorsey

He is the center of the plot

Is he an actor?

Yes, of course, he is

Is he successful?

Yes, of course, he's not



That doesn't mean he isn't real good

No one in town would disagree

He really could be good as Gielgud

But you won't see his name on the marquee



MICHAEL DORSEY: (spoken)

Carla, I threw it all away for you

Just to cross that bridge, Carla

That damn grey bridge



DIRECTOR 1: (spoken)

That's fine Mr. Dorsey

We're looking for someone younger



MICHAEL DORSEY: (spoken)

Oh, I can be younger



DIRECTOR 1: (spoken)

Actually, We're looking for someone shorter



MICHAEL DORSEY: (spoken)

Oh wait

See, I can be shorter



DIRECTOR 1: (spoken)

Actually, were looking for somebody different



MICHAEL DORSEY: (spoken)

Sounds to me like you don't know

What the hell you're looking for



DIRECTOR 1: (spoken)

We're looking for somebody else

Get out!



ENSEMBLE:

And now there is something quite familiar

He feels it rising like the moon

He's feeling victimized and bitter

Like nothing good is gonna happen soon

The odor of humiliation

Begins to permeate the room

The putrid stench of it surrounds him like

An inexpensive prostitute's perfume



MICHAEL DORSEY: (spoken)

Mommy, daddy, come quick

Something's wrong with Biscuit

He was chasing his tail

And then he fell down the well



DIRECTOR 2: (spoken)

That's good, but can you do it happier?



MICHAEL DORSEY: (spoken)

Happier?

The kid's dog just plunged down a well to its death

Why would he be happy?



DIRECTOR 2: (spoken)

'Cuz Im the director

And that's how the playwright wrote it



MICHAEL DORSEY: (spoken)

Then tell the playwright he's wrong



DIRECTOR 2: (spoken)

I'm also the playwright

Get out!



ENSEMBLE:

And his feet start to throb

And his head starts to ache

As he can't get a job

And he can't catch a break



MEN:

But he's free

And he's young



WOMEN:

He's not young



MEN:

Yeah, that's true



ENSEMBLE:

[?] on to someone

Who's exactly not you!



Someone more exciting

Someone more attractive

Someone they can deal with

Not a snotty jerk

They need someone nicer

Someone less reactive

Can you really blame them?

Will he ever work?



DIRECTOR 3: (spoken)

Get out!



ENSEMBLE:

Wow, he's batting zero

Dude, he's so pathetic

How does he keep going

Maybe he should stop

No! It's gonna happen

Soon they'll all be clapping

Soon he's gonna make it

He's gonna make it to the top

He's gonna make it to the top

He's gonna make it to the



MICHAEL DORSEY: (spoken)

No more orders

Kitchen's closed!



ENSEMBLE:
