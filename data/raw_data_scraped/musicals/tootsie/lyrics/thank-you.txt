Thank You


MICHAEL:

There's you and there's me

With a heart you discovered

These hands so familiar and warm to the touch

I love you, you know that

However you want it

Thank you, thank you, thank you so much



(spoken)

Julie, I was a better man with you as a woman,

Than I ever was with a woman as a man

I just have to learn how to do it all without the dress
