I Won't Let You Down


DOROTHY MICHAELS:

I've always imagined that you are the flower

And I am the Dirt

My world spins around you

Whenever you fall I'm the one who gets hurt



I give you all I have

Give me one thing in return



Have me help you, to help me

To help you, to help me

To help you to learn



That I won't let you down

I'll give you my heart and soul

I'll be here to play any role

You need me to play



I won't let you down

Whatever you want me to be

You give me your trust

I give you my word

I won't let you down



Nobody sees me, and nobody listens

And nobody cares

But you know what's in here

Love and Devotion that needs to be shared



(spoken): Pick it up!



I won't let you down



(spoken): That's Good, Thank You!



Because you believe in me

Because you're the one who can see

I'm here and alive!



I won't let you down

Cause when I felt empty inside

You filled up my cup

You lifted me up

And I won't let you down



(spoken): Up a whole step!



I'll never let you down

I'll do what you need me to do

I promise I'll always come through

Just call and I'm there



I won't let you down

Whoever you want me to be

You give me your trust

I'll give you my word

And I won't let you down



Please make the right choice

Remember my voice

I won't let you down



Just give it some thought

I love you a lot

I won't let you down

I won't let you down!
