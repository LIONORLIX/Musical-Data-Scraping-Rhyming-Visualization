Love While You Can


We're none of us getting any younger

You can feel the time go by

And maybe we can't lose our hurt and anger

But goddammit all, let's try



We plan a better day

But planets turn one way

So though it seems unlikely, girls

This is what I say



Love wherever and whenever and however you should

Yes, marriage is a bastard

But love is always good

It's nothing you prepare for

It's nothing that you plan

But love when this world lets you

Love while you can



Our love belongs to everyone who loves us

So it's not just you and me

And we both know love doesn't make us perfect

It just makes us want to be

If what we had before is broken on the floor

We can see the way the pieces work and make it something more



And love wherever and and whenever and however we feel

Let anger clean the crud out

Let love help us heal

It's not the love we dreamed of back when we began

But love if your heart let's you

Love while you can



I believe our fates will find us

I believe that we get but one true love

I believe in seeing signs

And I believe and trust the stars above

And I thought you believed in me

And deep down we were meant to be

I tried to let that go

But I can't let you go

And then these feelings flow

I still love you so



So love wherever and whenever and however love lives

It's fear that hides the heart away

It's love that forgives

It wasn't what we dreamed of

It wasn't in the plan

But love the way love finds you

Love while you can



Love and keep on living when the shit hits the fan

Love and be forgiving

Oh my Kate

My Anne

Love when this world lets you

Love while you can
