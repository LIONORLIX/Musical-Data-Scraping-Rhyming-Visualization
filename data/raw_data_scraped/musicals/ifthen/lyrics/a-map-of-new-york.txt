A Map of New York


Think of each plaza, pier, and public park

How many sit there empty, lonely, dark?

Think of it for tomorrow's sake

Think of how you and I can make our mark



You and I, we can draw a brand-new grid

Everything you dreamed of as a kid

Give it a year and go with me

Soon enough you will say, 'look what we two did'



You've always had the right dream

We've always made a tight team

Now at last you're back exactly where you ought to be

So let's make a map of New York, you and me



Twenty-two Reed

A building, sidewalk shade

Now a memory that for Beth will never fade

And I could be planning city sites

Where memories just like this one might be made



Thirty-three Bond where I wrote my first book

Greenwich and Moore where I learned how to cook

The Center Street courts, I interned there

The joy of this job is everywhere I look



That market was my first job

That diner was my worst job

And everywhere around me are these lives I left behind



The tunnel where I laid rail

The co-op where I made my first sale

They make a map of New York in my mind



Put a sticker on the map where you landed that first day

Put a pin on the (?), on the bridge, on the train, on JFK

On the street where I swore I'd afford a place someday



Every avenue and place

Every building every face

Of the lovers and the friends

The beginnings and the ends

Make a map of NYC

Where I live and who I'll be

And you'll find me



And you're feeling adrift, alone, apart

And suddenly life will somehow start

And a map of New York is written on your heart



I'm too old for all that shit

You'll be told I'm selling out

Then again, all these years, did I lose what I'm about?

On the street in the cold it's so hard to fight that doubt



Then you hear the tunnel hum

With the train about to come

And you surface to the street

Where you fall into the beat

You can trace the line to me

On a map of NYC

Right where I should be



Think of how human life will ebb and flow

People, and how they'll come and how they'll go

Remember the things we hoped and planned

Remember them and believe them

And you'll know

You'll know



We never walk a straight line

We never trust a street sign

But it's in the detour that we truly find our way

We always know the way home

As long as we can stay here we're home



And we make a map of work

And we make a map of play

And we make a map of New York every day



Ending the night and Twenty-Third and Third

Liz and her date who's hanging on each word
