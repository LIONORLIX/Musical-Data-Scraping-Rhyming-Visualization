Some Other Me


Somewhere there's a world where you and I are man and wife

We have a child, or three

And it's just fine with me

To love that life



And somewhere there's a world where from the first we never met

We never spoke, or kissed

We don't know what we missed

Or don't know yet



And I didn't go to Vassar, but to Smith or Yale or Brown

I ended up in Boston or some small Alaska town

To practice law or neuter cats or fish the Bering Sea

Those lives are lived somewhere

By some other me



Some other me is homeless

Some other me is queen

Some other me has seen things that no other me has seen

If I met her, I would ask her

That one question we both fear

Some other me, how did we end up here?



Somewhere there's a me who never loved that other you

Who liked you fine, I guess as buddies, more or less

And that would do



And somewhere there's a you who simply worshiped other me

And we were wild and hot and all the things we're not

And we were free



And somewhere I'm the president with plans that never fail

And somewhere I'm a rebel king, and somewhere I'm in jail

I didn't chase my glory days long after they were done

I found myself a woman, or a man, and had a son



Some other me's a rockstar

Some other me's still cool

Some other me does not feel like some tired old fool



And you and I are strangers

Or we're lovers

Or we're not

The other me's live with what they've got



Look down each road left untaken

Trace every turn and twist

The lives that we just let go by

The dreams we might have missed



Now we're old enough to know that

One road ends where one begins

The moment where the what-might-be's turn into might-have-beens



Somewhere there's a world where you and I can still be friends

Not like we were, not yet

We forgive, but don't forget

No happy ends, but friends
