Hey Kid


Hey, kid

Everyone's waiting on you, kid

Everyone's wondering what you'll do, kid

It's true, kid

Me too, kid



Hey, kid

We're so excited to know you'll soon be here

Say, kid

We're both delighted, though that may not seem so clear



But I did my OB rotation, so I know the ins and outs

And you're an act of God's creation, so I'm fine with all the doubts

I'm a doctor and a soldier

I've been shelled and under fire

But, kid, if I say that you don't scare me, I'm a liar



Now, kid

You did surprise me though I know the facts of life

Wow, kid

It terrifies me just to say, 'my pregnant wife'



'Cos kid, I gotta tell ya

I'm not ready, not a bit

There's this macho act I'll sell ya

While inside I lose my shit



It's not that I don't want you

'Cos I do, despite my fears

But, kid

Is it true you'll stick around for 18 years?



Then the call comes on the iPhone

I grab a cab 'cross town

I find her on the fourth floor

And they've got her in the gown



She's never looked less lovely

She's a grump and she's got gas

And the labor's eighteen hours

Oh my God, kid, move your ass!



Then at last you make your entrance

And well, kid, you're quite a sight

I'll be honest, you're disgusting

But I know that you're alright



Though you're screaming and you're spitting

And I can't quite see your charms

They clean you and they clothe you

And they put you in my arms



And I realize in an instant

That I've known you all along

That I've wanted you forever

That I'll never do you wrong



And whatever this world comes to

And whatever comes our way

I will watch you and protect you

I promise, kid, we'll be okay

We'll be okay

We'll be okay, kid



I feel like yelling, ring the bell and bang the drums

Say, kid

There's just no telling all the things that you'll become



And I think we'll have some fun here

Your mom and you and me

Before your time is done here

Kid of mine, I hope you'll see



That this life is what you make it

It's cliche, which means it's true

And, kid

It makes my life to know I helped make you



As a father, kid, I may not have a clue

But your mom and me will somehow muddle through

If my asshole dad could do it, I can too

In fact, I'll do better, I'll start new

'Cos, kid, my kid, our kid

I love you
