Best Worst Mistake


You can guard your heart forever

Keep it safe and keep it sound

But love won't feel so heavy

If you spread that shit around



What is it that you're afraid of?

Being hurt, let down, destroyed

Well you know, it all can happen

And there's more you can't avoid



You're a die-hard, you're a radical

A fighter through and through

So tell me why you're so afraid of a cause that's new

And true

Like me and you



So man up, break out, dive in

There's no knowing how it ends

Until you got up and begin



Climb in, breathe deep, hold on

You can't know how good it gets

'Til you go or 'til it's gone



Be lost, be wary, be afraid

But don't hideout in the dugout while that final game is played

Make that trade

I'll be the best worst mistake you ever made



Really? Sports metaphors?

Really.



It's not that I don't love you

'Cos I don't not love you

And I'd lie to say I'm never sometimes always thinking of you



But when something's deeply felt

It seems shallow just to say

The thing that's expected

The same dull cliche



Like you're so sweet

(so it's scare-ifying(?), terrifying)

You're so fine

(and you're panicked in a sweat)

You're the one

(it's the nightmare of all nightmares)

Please be mine

(and the best you'll ever get)



'Cos you're in love

(Love is neat)

Love's a bitch

(Love is nice)

Love's a queen

(Let it go)

Love's a witch

(Pay that price)

Love is joy

(Love is true)

Love's a boy

(who loves you)

I love you

(I love you)

I love you

(I love you)

For all time

(For all time)

For all time



You tricked me into saying that.



It's too late, it's done, you're through

'Cos I said it, and you said it

And I know you meant it, too



So man up

(man up)

Break out

(break out)

Dive in

There's no knowing how it ends

Until at last we both begin



We're lost, we're lonely, we're afraid

But the sun will still be shining

When we come out of the shade



?

I'll be the best worst mistake you ever made

(best worst mistake)

I'll be the best worst mistake you ever made

(best worst mistake)

I'll be the best worst mistake you ever made
