A Map Of New York (Reprise)


With everything that you've built

The plans you've drawn

All of those fears that held you back are gone

Isn't there nothing left to prove?

Isn't it time to think of moving on?



So maybe it's the wrong time

But you've been there a long time

You don't want to let yourself get stuck the way you do

So let's make a brand-new map

Just me and you
