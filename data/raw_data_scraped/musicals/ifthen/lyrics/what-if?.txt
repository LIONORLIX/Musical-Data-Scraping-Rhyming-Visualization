What If?


Here's how it starts, and here's how it ends

Two different hearts, maybe lovers or friends

No one knows the ways the long road bends



Once every day, your life starts again

No one can say just how or just when

Somehow the world turns inside out and then



Then, what if, what if, what if you wonder what if, what if?



What if I always belonged in the city that moves me with people who thrill me?

The marriage, the mortgage, I left them behind me before they could kill me?

My plan was just perfect, courageous and daring, to start my life new

Now I look at this morning, it moves me to say, 'Oh my God, what the hell did I do?'

I can do this I know, I just need to take care

Be smart, self-sufficient, and hyper-aware

'Cos I'm flirting with 40, there's no time to wait

And I can't help but feel I'm already too late



Tell me what if I'm bound for disaster?

What if I fall off a cliff?

Will I ever just learn how to live and not wonder 'what if?'

What if?

Do I go there with Lucas or stay here with Kate?

Oh God, why do I do this, obsess and debate?

I've been prudent and cautious for all my life long

And most of my choices turn out to be wrong



Tell me how could this make any difference?

How could it matter at all?

How do I make such a major event out of something so small?



Once every day, your life starts again

No one can say just how or just when

Somehow the world turns inside out and then



And then, then, what if, what if, what if you wonder, what if?



See each choice you make is a kind of a loss

Each turn that you take and each coin that you toss

You lose all the choices you don't get to make

You wonder about all the turns you don't take



And so what if I'd gone there with Lucas?

(what if, what if?)

And then what if I'd answered that phone?

(what if, what if?)

Think of all of the things you'd have done if only you'd known



Here's how it starts and here's how it ends

What if I'd gone there with Lucas?



Two different roads, and how each one bends

What if I'd stayed there with Kate?



(And then)

What if? What if?

(Then)

What if? What if I knew

(if you knew what would happen)

What would I do?

(if you knew would you know what to do?)

What if I choose will I change things forever?

When I leap will I fall off the cliff?

I choose and there's no turning back

No turning back

No turning back

And you wonder, 'what if?'

(what if, what if?)

What if?
