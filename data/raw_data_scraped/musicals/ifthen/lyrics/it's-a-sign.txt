It's a Sign


KATE

Yesterday this woman met this man in Madison Park

Quite by chance, all at random, as it were

But they met again just now

In this tunnel in the dark

Could mere chance have caused these two things to occur?

Or could there be another meaning to infer?

Could the universe have a message for him and her?



You meet a man who is handsome and nice

Quite by chance one day

(mm mm mm mm)

But then you meet that same handsome man twice - enticing!

That's not chance, no way

(ah-ah, no, no way)



The universe has a message for you

And if you're smart, then you'll let it through

Just a gentle shout, signal from above

It's plain to see, it's meant to be

You're destined for love



It's a sign

Oh, it's a sign

Like when clouds open up or the stars align

It's a sudden smile, a nice surprise

So act just like those wisest guys

And follow that North Star and you'll be fine

It's a sign



People? Who's read their signs today?



SUBWAY PASSENGER #1

Today a pigeon shit right on my head

(oh no)

It's still in my hair

(it's a sign)



SUBWAY PASSENGER #2

The Virgin Mary appeared in my bread, I said

(ah)

That's her face right there!

(a sign, it's a sign)



SUBWAY PASSENGER #3

I found a sandwich right here on the floor

(ooh, ooh, ooh)

Now those are signs that you can't ignore



KATE

It's perfect and it's plain

And rainbows in the rain

One more clue, there for you

Do I have to explain

That it's a sign?



Oh it's a sign

Like the leaves in your tea or the cork in you wine

It's a ladies wink, a poet's rhyme

A train door opened just in time

It isn't just some handsome stranger's line

It's a sign



It's a blue moon on a Monday night

A blue moon on a late-night flight

Patterns in your latte cup

Buttered bread falls butter-up

When a stray dog comes to stay

When a black cat walks your way

That tingle in your fingers, too

Means something good is here for you



Oh it's a sign

Oh it's a sign



KATE & PASSENGERS

Like when clouds open up or the stars align



KATE

Read your tea leaves just in case

Read the wrinkles on your face

They're telling you, your life is on the line

The Galaxy has got your grand design

It's perfect, it's profound, it's divine

It's divine

It's divine

It's a sign
