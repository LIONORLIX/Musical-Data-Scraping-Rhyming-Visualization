What If? (Reprise)


You stop and say hey to a stranger

And where will it lead, who can know

But you learn how to love the not knowing

So here I go

Here I go

Here I go



You choose and then everything changes

Take a breath and then fly off the cliff

And you know that there's no turning back

No turning back

No turning back



And you wonder what if?

What if?
