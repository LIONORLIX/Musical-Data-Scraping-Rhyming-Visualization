No More Wasted Time


Once upon a grad school

Beth met Oran and he said,

My dear, you're kind, you're pretty, with a brain inside your head.

I've got work out west, will you come with me if we're wed?

So off Beth went to Phoenix

Full of champagne, cake, and dread



Twelve years on, her hope had all but died

So she checked the wreck around her

And with a big, deep breath Beth cried,



No more wasted time

No more standing still

I once would dream of building cities

And now I think I will



She said, I'm done with life out west

And Oran well, we did our best

But I can't wait

No more wasted time

It's much too late



No more wasted time

No more time for doubt

You say you're not sure you're a hero

It's time to find out



So say you've made a few mistakes

Heroes know that's what it takes

To find their way

No more wasted time

Not one more day



We've got no time for playing nice

There's only time for strong

We've got no need for good advice

We've listened far too long

It's gone too wrong



No more wasted time

No more holding back

No bowing low and asking nicely

We need a new attack



We're gonna run the whole damn place

With some class and with some grace

And we'll do fine

No more wasted time

It's on the line



You've got no time for playing nice

I've got no time for playing nice

There's only time for strong

I know I'm strong

And we don't need to tell you thrice

You've waited for this long

I hope I won't go wrong



No more wasted time

No more wasted time

No more wasted breath

No hoping life will just get better

We've hoped it half to death

We've hoped it half to death

We've hoped it half to death



No praying for the perfect card

'Cos life is short and life is hard

So I don't care how

No more wasted time

No more wasted time

No more wasted time

No more wasted time

No more wasted time

Starting now

Now

Now
