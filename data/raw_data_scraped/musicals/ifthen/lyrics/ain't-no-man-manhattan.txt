Ain't No Man Manhattan


So you've got nothing much in common with the artist down in Red Hook

Who lost the place he works in so you could build some condos on the water

But he buys coffee from the coffee guy

Who's renting from the actor

Who's married to the doctor

Who is in the ER, trying to save your daughter

Ain't no man Manhattan, no island all his own

On Roosevelt or Staten

Ain't none of us alone

Your actions my reaction, in ways you won't expect

We're all in this together, yeah we all connect

Take the environment or housing

Human rights or education

Every issue is connected

To each person here there ain't no separation

Ain't no I in island, anywhere on earth

How much you love your life is

What every life is worth

Your answer is my question, my cause is your effect

We're all in this together, yeah we all connect

And we all somehow keep moving, even so

All of eight point two five million

All changing you in ways you might not know

Oh, ain't no man Manhattan, no island all his own

Or Roosevelt or Staten

Ain't none of us alone

We live in these collisions, these accidents arise

We somehow find each other in each other's eyes

So a kindergarten teacher helps a certain city planner

Meet a surgeon from Nebraska

And his best friend is a doctor

And the city keeps evolving

And people keep revolving

All of eight two point five million of us all

A different way for every single one

All turning and returning, fast and slow

And we somehow find each other

Even so
