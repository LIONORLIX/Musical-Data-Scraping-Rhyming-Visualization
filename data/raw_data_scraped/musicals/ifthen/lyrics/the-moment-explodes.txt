The Moment Explodes


The engine stops, the plane drops, the moment explodes

A sudden rush, a rude hush, and the moment explodes

The moment explodes



Into thoughts of all the things I've left undone

And flashes from a life I've just begun

Every friend I ever knew or thought I did

The love that I could give, the love I hid



Every stupid life before your eyes, cliche

Could I please go out some less expected way?

But now I'm alive or dying, crack those codes

When the moment explodes



Staircase dips, the foot trips, the moment explodes

The dark world curves, the car swerves, and the moment explodes

And the moment explodes



It reaches to the future and the past

To every moment ever, first or last

And every life I reached, I could not touch

And everyone I loved, or loved too much



And every chance I took or did not take

Connections that I made or did not make

But I'll never take those turns to other roads

Once the moment

When the moment

When the moment



The engine stops, the plane drops, the moment explodes
