You Don't Need to Love Me


You don't need to love me

Or tell me that you do

Don't make me any promises

Just promise we're not through

Don't give me one damn thing

I won't let you call this greed

Just let me give to you

That's the only thing I need

I know that this can work

If you plant one simple seed

You'd see it it grow



You don't need to love me

To know



You don't need to need me

It's better that you don't

If each of us can walk away

It won't matter that I won't

We'll both be self-contained

But together not alone

You can keep me in the dark

Hell, it's all I've ever known

But we both could use a friend

Who won't always check the phone

And take the call

You don't need to need me

at all



Let me be your emergency contact

Your occasional plus one

Your excuse to take a sick day

When the forecast calls for sun

We can keep on being lonely

But we don't have to be apart

And I'll never even ask you to let me have you heart

So I'll never break your heart

No I'll never break your heart



You don't need to love me

To let me help you through

You don't need to confide in me

I've got crap enough for two

You don't need to answer

I'll know before you do



But hear me

and believe me

You don't need to love me

The way that I love you
