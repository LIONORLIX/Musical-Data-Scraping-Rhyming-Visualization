To Hear You Say My Name


I Choose You and You Choose Me



(chorus)



I choose you and you choose me



that's the way it has to be



it's as simple as ABC



when I choose you and you choose me





Everybody has to make a choice



it can be the hardest thing to do



but it was a very natural thing



when it came to choosing you



(chorus)



I have never done this kind of thing



it is so mysterious and new



but it was a very natural thing when it came to choosing you



(chorus x3)
