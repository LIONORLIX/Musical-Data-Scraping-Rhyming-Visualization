Be Tender with Me Baby


You got the right to tell me

It's all over

It isn't like me to be

Begging you

Don't let go don't let go

Just stay with me another day

When I'm not myself

Please understand me

I'm so confused I don't know what to do

But don't give up

Don't give up

It just may take a little time

Be tender with me baby

I'm so afraid you'll go away

Be tender with me baby always

I know that you've been patient

With my weakness

And that you hate to see me cry

But I know yes I know

It doesn't have to be this way

But I'm so lonely I could die

Be tender with me baby

I'm so afraid you'll go away

Be tender with me baby always

Why does my heart keep on longing

Why do I feel like i do

I hope you see this is not really me

This is just a phase that I'm going through

Be tender with me baby

Be tender with me baby

I'm so afraid you'll go away

Be tender with me baby

For always always

Be tender with me baby

I'm so afraid you'll go away

Be tender with me baby

Always for always always
