Matchbox


Yeah I'm tired of sighing

Tired of worrying you too

But I made up my mind baby

What I'm gonna do

I got my clothes in a matchbox

I'm gonna forget about you



But I tried to tell you many times

But I never could do it

You believe me baby

This time I'm through

I got my clothes in a matchbox

I'm gonna forget about you



Now when things get harder

Yeah and rough on you

Don't try to get me back now baby

'Cause baby I'm through

I got my clothes in a matchbox

Gonna forget about you.
