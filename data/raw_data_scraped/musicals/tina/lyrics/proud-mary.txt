Proud Mary


You know

Every now and then I think you might like to hear something from us nice, easy

There's just one thing

You see we never ever do nothing nice, easy

We always do it nice and rough



And we're gonna take the beginning of this song and do it easy

But then we're gonna do the finish rough

That's the way we do

Proud Mary



Left a good job down in the city

Workin' for the Man every night and day

But I never lost one minute of sleepin'

I was worryin' 'bout the way things might have been



Big wheel keep on turnin'

Proud Mary keep on burnin'

And we're rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river



Listen to the story



Left a good job down in the city

Workin' for the Man every night and day

And I never lost one minute of sleepin'

And I was worryin' 'bout the way that things might have been



You know that big wheel keep on turnin'

Proud Mary keep on burnin'

And we're rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river



Cleaned a lot of plates in Memphis

You know I pumped a lot of 'tane down in New Orleans

But I never saw the good side of the city

Until I hitched a ride on the river boat queen



You know that big wheel keep on turnin'

Proud Mary keep on burnin'

And we're rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river

We're rolling on the river



Say we're rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river,

We're rolling on the river



I left a good job in the city

Workin' for the Man every night and day

And I never lost a minute of sleepin'

Worryin' 'bout the way things might have been



Big wheel keep on turnin'

Proud Mary keep on burnin'

Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river

Say we're rollin', we're rollin',

Rollin' on the river



Alright



Oh, I cleaned a lot of plates in Memphis

And I pumped a lot of 'tane down in New Orleans

But I never saw the good side of a city

'Til I hitched a ride on the riverboat queen



Big wheel keep on turnin'

Proud Mary keep on burnin'

And we're rollin', so we're rollin',

We're rollin' on the river

I tell you we're rollin', rollin',

We're rollin' on the river



Alright



If you come down to the river

I bet you're gonna find some people who live

And you don't have to worry if you got no money

People on the river are happy to give



Big wheel keep on turnin'

Proud Mary keep on burnin'

And we're rollin', and we're rollin',

And we're rollin' on the river

Tell me one more time

Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river



Alright



Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river

Alright then

We're rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river



So we're rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river

I tell you we're rollin', we're rollin',

We're rollin' on the river



Alright
