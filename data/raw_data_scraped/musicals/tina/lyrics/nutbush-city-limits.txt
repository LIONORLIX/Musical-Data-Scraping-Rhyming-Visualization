Nutbush City Limits


A church house gin house

A school house out house

On highway number nineteen

The people keep the city clean

They call it

Nutbush oh nutbush

Call it nutbush city limits



Twenty-five was the speed limit

Motorcycle not allowed in it

You go to the store on friday

You go to church on sunday

They call it

Nutbush oh nutbush

Call it nutbush city limits



You go to the fields on weekdays

And have a picnic on labor day

You go to town on saturday

But go to the church ev'ry sunday

They call it

Nutbush oh nutbush

Call it nutbush city limits



No whiskey for sale

You can't cop no bail

Salt pork and molasses

Is all you get in jail

They call it

Nutbush oh nutbush

Call it nutbush city limits



Little old town in tennessee

That's called a quiet little old

Community

A one-horse town you have to

Watch

What you're puttin' down in old

Nutbush

They call it

Nutbush oh nutbush

Call it nutbush city limits
