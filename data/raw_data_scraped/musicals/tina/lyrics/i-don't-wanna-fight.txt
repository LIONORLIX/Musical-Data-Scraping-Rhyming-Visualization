I Don't Wanna Fight


There's a pale moon in the sky

The kind you make your wishes on

Like the light in your eyes

The one I build my dreams upon

It's not here any longer

Something happened somewhere and we both know why

But me I'm getting stronger

We must stop pretending

I can't live this lie



I don't care who's wrong or right

I don't really wanna fight no more

Too much talking babe

Let's sleep on it tonight

I don't really wanna fight no more

This is time for letting go



I hear a whisper in the air

That simply doesn't bother me

Boy, can't you see that i don't care

Or are you looking right through me

It seems to me that lately (Seems to me that lately)

You look at me the wrong way and I start to cry

Could it be that maybe (Could it be that maybe)

This crazy situation is the reason why



I don't care who's wrong or right

I don't really wanna fight no more

Too much talking babe

Don't care now who's to blame

I don't really wanna fight no more

This is time for letting go



Hanging on to the past

It only stands in our way

We have to grow for our love to last

But we just grew apart



Oh don't wanna hurt no more

But baby don't you know

No, I don't wanna hurt no more...

Tired of all these games

This time i'm walking babe
