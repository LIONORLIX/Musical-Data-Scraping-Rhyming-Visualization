The Father of the Bride


My daughter is marrying an idiot!

How could she stoop so low?

My daughter is marrying a nincompoop.

She love him, but even so...

I thought I had taught her what to expect

For someone as fine as she;

A man with some fire, some brains and some tact!

Someone, in fact, like me!



My daughter is marrying an idiot!

The stupidest of men.

And I wish she were just my own little girl again!

Marriage is a sacrament -

Which is just a way to say -

That a very private thing is done -

In a very public way.

You stand among your neighbors -

Like a lamb before the slaughter -

And watch some village idiot -

Take away your daughter.

The groom has got a family -

That sits around and gapes -

And bears a strange resemblance

To anthropoidal apes!

It's like some sort of nightmare,

And the thought that really kills

Not only must you suffer,

But you have to pay the bills!

My daughter is marrying an idiot.

The stupidest of men!

And I wish she were just my own little girl again!
