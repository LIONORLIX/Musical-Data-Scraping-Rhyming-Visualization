Where Are the Snows?


He-Where are the snows of yesteryear?

When did that double chin appear?

Our boy will be sixteen this year.

How did the time slip by?

She-Where are the snows of yesterday?

We used to be quite bright and gay.

He-Whoopee!

She-Now every night at home we stay.

How did the time slip by?

Both-Oh, what we were.

We were something to see!

Would you believe -

We used to be fancy and free.

He-Where are the snows of yesteryear?

When did my belt get out to here?

She-Our daughter bought her first brassiere.

Both-How did the time slip by?

Where are the snows?

Nobody knows.

How did the time slip by?
