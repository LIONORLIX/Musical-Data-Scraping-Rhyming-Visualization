What Is a Woman?


This is very strange.

Everything is changing.

Suddenly a door

Can slam.



This is very strange.

Suddenly we're strangers.

And I start to wonder

Who I am.



What is a woman?

What is she made of?

Why is a woman afraid of

Not being in love?



What is a woman?

What does she long for?

Why is it wrong for a woman

To be all alone?



Young girls are April

With rainbows and changes.

One day they grow up

And April is over forever



To be a woman

Means being lonely.

That's why a woman is only

Alive when in love.



Young girls are April

With rainbows and changes.

One day they grow up

And April is over forever.



To be a woman

Means being lonely.

That's why a woman

Is only alive

When in love.
