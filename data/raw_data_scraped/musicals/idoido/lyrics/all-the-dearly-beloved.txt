All the Dearly Beloved


(Michael) All the dearly beloved have gathered at last.

(Agnes) Faces from the future and those from the past.

He-Distant cousins and uncles and aunts.

She-The boy who took me to my very first dance.

He-The girl I used to think was somewhat cute.

She-My mother's uncle Herbert from the institute.

Both-And they've all of them come with one thing in mind; just to see us say - "I do."

He-I do, I do, that's all I have to say. I do, I do, I say it every day. I did, I did, I did it just last night. I said it at the church rehearsal, and I got it right. I do, I do. How easily it's said. I wonder what would happen if I said "I don't" instead!

She-This morning I woke up so early. In fact, I never slept. I got down the box inside my closet where my very best things are kept. Then I fixed me a cup of nice hot tea, and I locked my door inside. Then I looked at my high school photographs, and cried (He-I do!) and cried (He-I do!) and cried (He-I do, I do!)!
