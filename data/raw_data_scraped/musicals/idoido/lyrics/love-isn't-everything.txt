Love Isn't Everything


He-At one minute after two in the morning,

Six hours following my wife's confinement,

Early on the day of January 12th,

In room 22 of the new city hospital,

A brand new person suddenly was

Who never was to be.

He weighted six pounds and fourteen ounces.

And we name him after me!

A son! A son! A son!



She-Love isn't everything.

It cannot buy the pills,

Or pay the doctor bills.

Or warm the baby's formula when he starts crying!

Love isn't everything.

It won't provide a new supply of fresh dry diapers.

Love keeps you on the run, but when it's said and done -

Love is what make it sort of fun,

Sort of fun, sort of fun, sort of fun.



He-Bicycle, tricycle, roller skates, clothes!

She-That's how the money goes.

He-Cowboy, Indian, hobby horse, guns!

She-That's where the money runs.



(She is once again pregnant)



She-At two minutes after four in the morning,

Five hours following my next confinement,

Early on the day of April 17th

In room 22 of the new city hospital,

A brand new person suddenly was who never used to be,

She weighted five pounds and thirteen ounces,

And they say she looks like me!

A girl! A girl! A girl!



He-Love isn't everything.

It will not hire a nurse or fill an empty purse.

Love cannot pay for milk, or put the satin ruffles on her party dresses.

Love isn't everything.

It will not sign the check for her piano lessons.

Love kicks you once or twice.

But when you pay the price,

Love is what makes it sort of nice,

Sort of nice, Sort of nice, Sort of nice.



She-Baby doll, mama doll, safety pins, clothes!

He-That's how the money goes.

She-Middy-blouse, petticoat, Buster Brown shoes!

He-Gives you the money blues.

Both-Love keeps you on the go.

But when you're feelin' low -

She-Love is what keeps you hummin'

He-While all the bills keep comin' -

Both-Love is what make it sort of fun!

Sort of fun; sort of fun; sort of fun!

Love make it sort of fun!
