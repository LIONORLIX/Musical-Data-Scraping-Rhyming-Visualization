I Do! I Do!


She-There's a strange new world that you enter when you say I do.

He-I do.

She-Such a strange new world that you barely can believe it's true.

He-It's true.

She-For your friends all shower you with shoes and rice!

He-Your head is spinning, and you feel so nice!

Both-Who think that marriage is a paradise? I do! I do!

She-In this strange new world that you enter when you say I do

He-I do - You can almost see that the future's gonna be a dream-

She-Come true-

Both-You can throw away your every care and doubt! For that what married life is all about! I do! I do! I do!
