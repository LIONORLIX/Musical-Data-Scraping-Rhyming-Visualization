Roll Up the Ribbons


He-Roll up the ribbons, fold up the papers

Stow all these things away!

This day is done, and another is on its way.

She-Pack up the present; look to the future.

One thing I know is true.

The best day of all is the day that is on its way.

Both-Waiting for you.

The best day of all is the day that is on its way.

She-Waiting for you.

He-Waiting for you.

Both-Waiting for you.
