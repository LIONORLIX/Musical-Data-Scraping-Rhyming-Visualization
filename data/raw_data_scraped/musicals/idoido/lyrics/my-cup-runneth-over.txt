My Cup Runneth Over


She-Sometimes in the morning when shadows are deep,

I lie where beside you just watching you sleep.

And sometimes I whisper what I'm thinking of:

My cup runneth over with love!

He-Sometimes in the evening when you do not see,

I study the small things you do constantly.

I memorize moments that I'm fondest of.

My cup runneth over with love!

Both-In only a moment we both will be old.

We won't even notice the world turning cold.

And so, in this moment, with sunlight above.

My cup runneth over

She-with love.

He-With love.

She-With love...with (she grasps bedpost as first pain hits her)
