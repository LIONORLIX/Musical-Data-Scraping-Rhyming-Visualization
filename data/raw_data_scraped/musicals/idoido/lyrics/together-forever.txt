Together Forever


He-A man and a woman are meant for each other, are meant for each other as husband and wife.



From this moment forward, I promise to love thee;

I promise to love thee the rest of my life.

Both-Together forever, forever together.

For this is the promise you give.

ogether forever, forever together.

Through all of the sorrow - and happiness.

Together as long as you live.

She-To honor and cherish, forsaking all other.

Forsaking all others, I offer my heart.

For richer, for poorer, to love and to comfort, to love and to comfort till death do us part.



Both-Together forever, forever together, for this is the promise you give.



Together forever, forever together, through all of the sorrow - and happiness, together as long as you live.
