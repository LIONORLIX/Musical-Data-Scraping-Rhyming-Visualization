Someone Needs Me


She-Did someone suddenly decorate the sky?

He-Did someone suddenly hire a band to play?

She-I'm suddenly laughing - even while I cry -

I've simply got to celebrate this day.

All at once I'm lighter than air.

The nicest things are happening.

He-All at once I haven't a care.

Tonight I might try anything.

She-Moments ago I felt so alone -

Frightened and ready to run away

Then don't you see he reached out to me

And I'm declaring a holiday.

He-Everyday!

Both-All at once I feel so alive

As bright as I will ever be,

For you see - someone needs me!



She-For you see - someone needs - me!

For you see - someone need me!
