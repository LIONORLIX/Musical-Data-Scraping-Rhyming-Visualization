Something Has Happened


Something has happened.

Something new, as you can plainly see.

All at once there is someone else,

where once there was only me.

If I hold so still that my heart doesn't beat

He will sometimes kick me gently with his feet.

Oh - something has happened.

Something old.

But to me it is still so new.

For all at once, instead of one - I am two.
