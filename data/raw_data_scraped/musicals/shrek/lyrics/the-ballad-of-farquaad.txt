The Ballad of Farquaad


Farquaad

(spoken)

My father simply couldn't accept that i wanted nothing to do with the family business...that lowly,

Dirty family business...



(sung)

My daddy was a miner

So he wasn't much around

Foraging for diamonds

A life spent underground



Daddy didn't talk much

He barely said hello

He'd simply mutter "heigh ho"

And off to work he'd go



Daddy was grumpy...



My momma was a princess

Who left her crown behind

Daddy was her true love, so

Momma didn't mind



I never knew my momma

But she could've been a queen

She married way beneath her...

Beneath her knee, i mean



Ohhh, daddy's bed was lumpy

So mommy couldn't sleep

Daddy built a new one

So tall and so steep



Twenty-five mattresses she slept upon

One night she rolled over...

And momma was gone



So daddy was grumpy...



Me and my old man

A tale as old as dirt

A bitter distant father

In a tiny undershirt



Daddy up and left me

Left me good as dead

Now he lives in squalor

Sleeping seven to a bed



(spoken)

You abandoned me in those woods, daddy.

Well i crawled out! And up! Oh, if only you could see me now, daddy...

I'd invite you to the wedding but you have to be

This tall to get in! Hahahahahaha!



(sung)

My bride-to-be is gorgeous

Her wedding dress, designer

The guest list will be major

Without a minor miner



Guards

La la la la la la la la la la la la la



Farquaad

Packs of royal lackeys

Playing violin



Guards

Strings of royal underlings



Farquaad & (guards)

Who will not let you in!

Ha ha, ha ha, ha ha!

Tricked out carriage!

(tricked out carriage)

Twenty stallions!

(twenty stallions)

With a coachman named raoul

(with a coachman named raoul)

Big reception!

(big reception)

With a boy band!

(with a boy band)

And a royal deejay by the pool...



Yes! I can see my future

And so it shall be done

It's total domination

With some torture just for fun, hee hee!



'Cause i will have my wedding and i will have a queen!

And once i get that crown on

You will get the guillotine



And i'll punish you daddy

'Cause i'm all grown up and bigger than you'll ever know!



You're gonna pay daddy!

It's any day daddy!

I'm off to work

Heigh ho!
