[Pinocchio]

(Spoken)

Oh, dopped on a swamp. Man, I tell you sometimes being a fairytale creature sucks pine sap.



[Pinocchio]

Life is disappointing,

Whoa is what I know.

Outted by my nose,

That's just how it goes,

For poor Pinocchio.

Story of my life,

Always doomed to fail.

Cheated by a fox,

Swallowed by a whale.

That's the story of my life, oh yeah,

That's the story of my life.
