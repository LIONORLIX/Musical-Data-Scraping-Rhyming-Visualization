What's Up, Duloc?


Performers

Welcome to duloc,

Such a perfect town.

Here we have some rules,

Let us lay them down.

Don’t make waves, stay in line,

And we’ll get along fine.

Duloc is a perfect place.



Please keep off the grass

Shine your shoes, wipe your face.

Duloc is, duloc is, duloc is a perfect place.



Performer

And here’s the man who made it happen!

That towering colossus of moxie!

Looooooooord farquaad!

(lord farquaad appears on a central balcony a la evita.  Turns around and feigns surprise.)



Farquaad

Oh, it’s you! What a terrific surprise.

(sings)

Once upon a time

This place was infested.

Freaks on every corner-

I had them all arrested

Hey nonny-nonny-nonny-no



If you had a quirk, you didn’t pass inspection.

We all have our standards,

But i will have perfection.

And sooooo?

And sooooo?
