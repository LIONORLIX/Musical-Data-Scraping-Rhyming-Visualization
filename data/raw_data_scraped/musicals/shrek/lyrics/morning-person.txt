Morning Person


Good morning birds

Good morning trees

Ohh what a lovely day

The suns so big it burns my eye

But really that's ok



A brand new day

More things to do

So many plans to make

I've had 6 cups of coffee

So i'm really wide awake





I've always been a morning person

A morning girl

Hurray

(going up each time until the bird explodes)

Cheep cheep cheep cheep cheep

Hurray

Cheep cheep cheep cheep cheep

Hurray

Cheep cheep cheep cheep cheep

Hurray



Good morning dear

Say have you heard to day's

My wedding day

I haven't met my husband yet

I'm hopeful anyway



Ill wear a gown

Well have a ball

And dance for ever more

He'll take me in his massive arms and spin me in his massive arms



I've always been a morning person

A morning girl

Hurray





(mouse tap)





I'm ready to start adventure

I'm going to start one today

I thought i was a monster

But this morning

This morning

This morning i'm ok

This morning i'm ok
