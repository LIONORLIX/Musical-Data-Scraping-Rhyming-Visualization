The Goodbye Song


Shrek: I'm going back to find this guy farquad right now

and get him to send you back right where you came from.



Creatures: yay!



Shrek: but first let me say (sung) goodbye.

Those are my last words, goodbye. Just don't mess up the house. Keep it clean.

No wolves in the bed! I'm leaving say goodbye to the land.

You'll go back to duloc, as fast as you can!



Shrek: (spoken) goodbye fairytale friends.



Narrator: and off he went.
