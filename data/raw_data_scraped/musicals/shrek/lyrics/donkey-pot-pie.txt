DRAGON:

DONKEY:

Draaaaagooooooooon!



DRAGON:

You didn't knock when you entered, baby

You didn't wipe your feet.



DONKEY:

(terrified)

Aww, geez.



DRAGON:

I didn't see no Open House sign.

Is this is a Trick or Trade?

OO-oo-oo!



DONKEY:

A little help here!



DRAGON:

You need to brush up on fairytales, friend.

Cause dragons like their sleep.



DONKEY:

Go on and grab some shut-eye!

I'm gonna bake you.

I'm gonna make you a donkey pot pie.



DONKEY:

Salisbury steak you

I'll frosted flake you

I'll paty-cake you, my donkey pot pie

Yeah!

Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!



DONKEY:

What a minute!

My, what big teeth you have.

They're so... sparklin' white.

I bet you hear this from all of your food,

but you much bleach at night.



Is that a hint of minty freshness.

(Oh, I am scared to death!)

I like a girl with a dazzlin' smile.

And tic-tac on her breath.

Oh-oh-oh...oh-oh...

Don't kill me,

lady with the pretty teeth.

I'm gonna love you,



DONKEY:

Uh-oh.



DRAGON:

And take hold of you.



DONKEY:

Slow down, baby.

DONKEY:
