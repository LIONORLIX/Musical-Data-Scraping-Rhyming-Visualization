Travel Song


Shrek

(spoken)

You know, this may turn into the longest day of my entire life



Donkey

(spoken)

Oo! I got the perfect remedy for that!



Shrek

(spoken)

Donkey please no. I am begging you-



Donkey

Sing a song

Yes a travel song

When you gotta go somewhere

'Cause the fun is getting there.

Yeah. Oh what the heck, i must confess

I love a road trip!



Sing a song.

Hit the trail.

Forget the maps. Forget the guides.

Before ya know it, you've made strides with me.



And i know - all i need - all along

Is a path - and a pal - and a song,

So i'm singin',

And i'm pallin' with you,

(spoken)

See? It makes the time go by faster!



Shrek

(sings)

Why me?

Why me?



Donkey

This is nice.



Shrek

Tell me what was my crime?



Donkey

We are strolling

(sees puss in boots walking by)



Shrek

He's as chatty as a parrot.

More annoying than a mime.



Donkey

Hey, look, a cat who's wearing boots!

That's crazy!



Shrek

Why me?

Why me?

A simple answer would be fine



Donkey

This is good cardio



Shrek

Won't someone please

Send me a sign?



Donkey

Oh look, a sign! Yunita pal avenue straight ahead!



Shrek

What did i do to deserve this?

Honestly

This ass 'o mine is asinine

Why me?!!



Donkey

Oh man, what could be better than this?!



Shrek

Why me?

Why me?

A simple answer would be fine

Won't somebody please send me a sign?



Donkey

Sing a song!

Hit the road!

It's the way

To get around!

Before ya know it, you've

Gained ground with me!



Shrek

What did i do to deserve this?

Honestly...



Donkey

And i know

All i need

All along is a path

And a pal

And a song



Shrek

This ass 'o mine

Is asinine



Donkey

So, i'm singin'...

And i'm pallin'...

With you-

Oo-oo-oo-oo...



Shrek

Oo-oo-oo-oo...



Shrek

That'll do donkey. That'll do.
