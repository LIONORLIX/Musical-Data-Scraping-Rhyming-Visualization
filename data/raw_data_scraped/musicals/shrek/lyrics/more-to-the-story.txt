More to the Story


Fiona:



This is by the book

A picture perfect bride

I got my happy ending

In a fairytale the knott must get tied



This is what i dreamed

Finally it's real

I knew what i might look like

But i never thought how i might feel



And there's more

More

More to the story

What you so often see isn't always so

There's more

More to the story

Now i know



Every princess is a beauty

Every dragon must be cruel

Big goes with bad

And royal goes with beauty

We play our parts

We follow every rule



This is by the book

I knew it from the start

The ogre tries to hurt you

But i never knew they meant in the heart



And there's more

More

More to the story

What you so clearly see

Isn't always so



There's more

More to the story

Now i know

Now i know



What you so fondly told

Isn't always so

There's more

More

To the story

Now i know



This is by the book

I got my happy ending
