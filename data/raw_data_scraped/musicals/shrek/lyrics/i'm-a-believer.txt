I'm a Believer


I thought love was only true in fairy tales

Meant for someone else but not for me.

Love was out to get me (dum dum dum dum dum)

That's the way it seems (dum dum dum dum dum)

Disappointment haunted all my dreams.



And then I saw her face

Now I'm a believer.

Not a trace

Of doubt in my mind.

I'm in love

(oooooo)

I'm a believer, I couldn't leave her

if I tried



I thought love was more or less a given thing

It seems the more I gave the less I got, Oh Yeah

What's the use in trying

All you get is pain

When I needed sunshine I got rain



And then I saw her face,

Now i'm a believer.

Not a trace

Of doubt in my mind.

I'm in love

(oooooo)

I'm a believer, I couldn't leave her

if I tried



(the love)



love was out to get (dum dum dum dum dum)

that`s the way it seems (dum dum dum dum dum)

dissapointment haunted all my dreams



And then I saw her face,

Now I'm a believer.

Not a trace

Of doubt in my mind.

I'm in love

(oooooo)

I'm a believer,

I couldn't leave her if I tried



Then I saw her face,

Now I'm a believer

Not a trace of doubt in my mind,

Now I?m a Believer

Yeah, yeah, yeah,

Yeah, yeah, yeah



I'm a believer.



I'm a believer.
