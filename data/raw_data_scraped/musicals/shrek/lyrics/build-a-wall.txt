Build A Wall


Shrek



I'm gonna build me a wall, I'll make it ten feet high.

See ya later pal, bye bye.

No one gettin' in so don't you even try.

A ten foot wall..



I'm gonna build me a wall, I'm gonna disappear.

What's the matter pal, am I not bein' clear?

Can't you take a hint, am I getting through at all?

Just get outta here..



I was told the world would despise me.

So I should have known, I should have guessed.

I thought these two might be different.

Well now I know, they're just like all the rest.



I'm gonna be what they want, I'm gonna be what they say.

Hey world, I'll do it your way!

You're looking for a monster, it's your lucky day.

I'll be what you want..



What a fool to think she might love me.

I opened my heart and let her walk through.

She wanted prince charming, I wanted my home back,

How lucky both our wishes came true..



Gonna build me a wall, a perfect place to hide.

Hey world, stay on your side.

The best way to conquer they say is to divide.



Gonna build a wall.

Gonna be what they say.

Gonna hide in my heart.



Gonna build a wall...
