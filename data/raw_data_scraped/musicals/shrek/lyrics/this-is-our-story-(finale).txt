This is Our Story (Finale)


[Fiona]

I waited all my life

Lived it by the book

Now i know that's not my story

You take me as i am

Love me as i look

Standing here in all my glory



I am sweetness

I am bratty

I'm a princess

I'm a fatty

I'm a mess of contradictions in a dress

I am sassy

I am sappy

When i'm with you

I am happy

This is my story



[shrek]

You laugh at all my jokes

Even though they're crude

You don't mind that i'm not classy



[shrek & fiona]

We make a perfect pair

Radiant and rude

So in love and much too gassy



We are ogres

We are scary

We are donkeys

We are hairy

We have bold and brand new stories to be told

We will write them

[ find more lyrics on www.mp3lyrics.org/qvd3 ]

We will tell them

You will hear them

You will smell them

This is our story



[spoken]

...and that is how the little ogre came

To live on the swamp with a beautiful princess-

And his best friend!

And his best friend!

And a gingerbread man!

And a very handsome puppet!

And an elf!

And a fairy godmother!

And a witch!

And a crossdressin' wolf!

And three pigs!



[sung]

What makes us special

(what makes us special)

What makes us special

(what makes us special)

Makes us strong



We are witches

We are fairies

We are wierdos

I'm an aires!

We're a giant different sampler here to try



We are puppets

We are rabbits

We are hobbits with bad habits

We're a screwy but delighted crazy stew

We are different

And united

We are us

And we are you



This is our story

This is our story

This is our story



God bless us everyone!



The end
