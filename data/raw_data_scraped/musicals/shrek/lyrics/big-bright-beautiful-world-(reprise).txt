Big Bright Beautiful World (Reprise)


Shrek:



It's a big bright beautiful world

with happiness all around.

It's peaches and cream

if a dream comes true.



It's a big bright beautiful world

with possibilities everywhere.

If true love is blind

maybe you won't mind the view?



I know I'm not the handsome prince

for whom you waited

I don't have a fancy castle,

and I'm not sophisticated.

A princess and an ogre,

I admit, is complicated.

You've never read a book like this,

but fairytales should really be updated.



It's a big bright beautiful world.

I see it now, I'll let it in.

I'll tear down a wall

and clear a spot for two

to be with you.
