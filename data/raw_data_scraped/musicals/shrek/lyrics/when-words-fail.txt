When Words Fail


[Shrek]

Princess…

How’s it going first of all?

Good’

Uh, it’s good for me too.

I’m okay



I picked this flower

Right over there

Is where it grew

And I don’t really like it

But it made me think of you

Because it’s pretty

Is what I’m trying to say

And you are also pretty

But I like you anyway



So please accept this flower

With its petals and a stem

Which represent my feelings

And tells you how..

(spoken)

Oh man I’m in trouble



When words fail

What will I do’

When words fail

How will she know how I feel?

When words fail

Will I fail too’



Hello fair princess

Oh look the moon

Is out tonight

You remind me of that moon

Because it’s big and bright

And by big I don’t mean chubby

Obviously you’re not fat

But your personality is biggish

Is what I meant by that



Sorry ‘bout that fat thing,

I’m on the hefty side myself

I have to blame the gene pool

Which reminds me of’

Oh where I am going with this



When words fail

What will I do’

When words fail

How will she know how I feel?

When words fail

Will I fail too’



Do I have a snowball’s chance?

Are my prospects just too grim?

I spent my life stuck in the mud

Now I’m crawling out on a limb



If words fail

She’ll know what I mean

If words fail

She’ll just take my hand

She sees me like no one else has

If words fail

She’ll understand

She’ll understand
