Goodbye Until Tomorrow/I Could Never Rescue You


CATHERINE

Don't kiss me goodbye again

Leave this night clean and quiet

You want the last word

You want me to laugh

But leave it for now



All you can say

All you can feel

Was wrapped up inside that one perfect kiss

Leave it at that:

I'll watch you turn the corner and go...



And goodbye until tomorrow

Goodbye until the next time you call

And I'll be waiting

Goodbye until tomorrow

Goodbye till I recall how to breathe

And I have been waiting

I have been waiting for you



I stand on a precipice

I struggle to keep my balance

I open myself

I open myself one stitch at a time



Finally yes!

Finally now!

Finally something takes me away

Finally free!

Finally he can cut through these strings

And open my wings!



So goodbye until tomorrow!

Goodbye until my feet touch the floor

And I will be waiting

I will be waiting!

Goodbye until tomorrow

Goodbye until the rest of my life

And I have been waiting

I have been waiting for you

Waiting for you

Waiting for you



JAMIE

I called Elise to help me pack my bags

I went downtown and closed the bank account

It's not about another shrink

It's not about another compromise

I'm not the only one who's hurting here

I don't know what the hell is left to do

You never saw how far the crack had opened

You never knew I had run out of rope and



I could never rescue you

All you ever wanted

But I could never rescue you

No matter how I tried

All I could do was love you hard

And let you go



No matter how I tried

All I could do was love you

God, I loved you so

So we could fight

Or we could wait

Or I could go...



CATHERINE

Goodbye until tomorrow!

Goodbye until I crawl to your door

And I will be waiting

I will be waiting



JAMIE

You never noticed how the wind had changed



CATHERINE

Goodbye until tomorrow!



JAMIE

I didn't see a way we both could win



CATHERINE

Goodbye until I'm done thanking God

For I have been waiting

I have been waiting for you

I have been waiting!



JAMIE

Goodbye, Cathy



CATHERINE

I have been waiting for you



JAMIE

Goodbye



CATHERINE

I will keep waiting -

I will be waiting for you



Just close the gate

I'll stand and wait

Jamie...



BOTH

Goodbye
