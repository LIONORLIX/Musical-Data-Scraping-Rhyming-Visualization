A Part of That


CATHERINE

One day we're just like "Leave it to Beaver"

One day it's just a typical life

And then he's off on

A trip to Jamie-land

Staring catatonic out the window

Barely even breathing all the while



And then he'll smile

His eyes light up and deep within the ground

Without a sound

A moment comes to life

And I'm a part of that

I'm a part of that

I'm a part of that



Next day it's just like

It never happened

We're making dinners

We're making plans

Then he gets on the

Mule train to Jamie-land

Handful after handful of Doritos

Circling the apartment, logging miles



And then he smiles

His eyes light up

And how can I complain?

Yes, he's insane

But look what he can do

And I'm a part of that

I'm a part of that

I'm a part of that



And it's true

I tend to follow in his stride

Instead of side by side

I take his cue

True, but there's no question

There's no doubt

I said I'd stick it out

And follow through

And when I do



Then he smiles

And where else can I go?

I didn't know

The rules do not apply

And then he smiles

And nothing else makes sense

While he invents

The world that's passing by

And I'm a part of that

I'm a part of that

I'm a part of that

Aren't I?



I'm a part of that

I'm a part of that

I'm a part of that
