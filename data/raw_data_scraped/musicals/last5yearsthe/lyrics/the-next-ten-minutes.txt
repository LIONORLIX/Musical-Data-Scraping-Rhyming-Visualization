The Next Ten Minutes


JAMIE

No, that one's Jerry Seinfeld

That one's John Lennon there

No, the Dakota

The San Remo is up a few blocks

Have you been inside the Museum?

We should go

Meet the dinosaurs



cathy



Will you share your life with me

For the next ten minutes?

For the next ten minutes

We can handle that

We could watch the waves

We could watch the sky

Or just sit and wait

As the time ticks by

And if we make it till then

Can I ask you again

For another ten?



And if you in turn agree

To the next ten minutes

And the next ten minutes

Till the morning comes

Then just holding you

Might compel me to

Ask you for more

There are so many lives I want to share with you

I will never be complete until I do



CATHERINE

I'm not always on time

Please don't expect that from me

I will be late

But if you can just wait

I will make it eventually



Not like it's in my control

Not like I'm proud of the fact

But anything other than being exactly on time

I can do



I don't know why people run

I don't know why things fall through

I don't know how anybody survives in this life

Without someone like you

I could protect and preserve

I could say no and goodbye

But why, Jamie, why?



I want to be your wife

I want to bear your child

I want to die

Knowing I

Had a long, full life in your arms

That I can do

Forever, with you



JAMIE

Will you share your life with me



CATHERINE

Forever



JAMIE

For the next ten lifetimes?



CATHERINE

Forever, Jamie



JAMIE

For a million summers



BOTH

Till the world explodes

Till there's no one left

Who has ever known us apart



JAMIE

There are so many dreams

I need to see with you...



CATHERINE

There are so many years

I need to be with you...



JAMIE

I will never be complete



CATHERINE

I will never be alive



JAMIE

I will never change the world

Until I do



CATHERINE

I do



JAMIE

I do



CATHERINE

I do



BOTH

I do...



CATHERINE

Is that one John Lennon?

That's the San Remo

Isn't that the Museum?

Can we go see the dinosaurs?
