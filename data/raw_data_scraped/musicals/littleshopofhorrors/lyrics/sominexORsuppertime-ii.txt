Sominex/Suppertime II


[AUDREY]

I couldn't sleep

I took a Sominex

But voices in my head kept saying

Go to Seymour, talk to Seymour

I drank some tea

But gee the feeling wasn't gone

Seymour, sweetheart

Tell me, darling

What's been going on?



[AUDREY II]

Hey little lady, hello

You're lookin' cute as can be

You're lookin' mighty sweet

No, it ain't Seymour- it's me!

You're friendly Audrey Two

This plant is talking to you



Come on and give me a drink

Hey, little lady, be nice

Sure do, I'll drink it straight

Don't need no glass or no ice

Don't need no twist of lime

And now it's suppertime!
