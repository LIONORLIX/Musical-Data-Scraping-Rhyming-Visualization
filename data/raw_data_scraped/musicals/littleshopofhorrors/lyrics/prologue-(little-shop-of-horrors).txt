Prologue (Little Shop of Horrors)


On the twenty-first day of the month of September

in an early year of a decade not too long before our own,

the human race suddenly encountered a deadly

threat to its very existence.

And this terrifying enemy surfaced,

as such enemies often do,

in the seemingly most innocent and unlikely of places.



[CRYSTAL, RONETTE, CHIFFON]

Little shop, little shoppa horrors.

Little shop, little shoppa terror.

Call a cop.  Little shoppa horrors.

No, oh, oh, no-oh!



Little shop, little shoppa horrors.

Bop sh'bop, little shoppa terror.

Watch 'em drop! Little shoppa horrors.

No, oh, oh, no-oh!



Shing-a-ling, what a creepy thing

to be happening!

Shang-a-lang, feel the sturm

and drang in the air.



Sha-la-la, stop right where you are.

Don't you move a thing.

You better (tellin' you, you better)

Tell your mama somethin's gonna

get her

She better (ev'rybody better)

Beware!



Little shop, little shoppa horrors.

Bop sh-bop, you'll never stop

the terror.

Little shop, little shoppa horrors.

No, oh, oh, no, oh, oh, no, oh, oh, no!
