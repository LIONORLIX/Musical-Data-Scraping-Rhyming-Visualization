Suppertime


[AUDREY II]

He's got your number now

He knows just what you've done

You got no place to hide

you got nowhere to run

He knows your life of crime

I think it's suppertime



He's got his facts all straight

You know he's on your trail

He's gonna turn you in

They're gonna put you in jail

He's got the goods and I'm

All set for suppertime



Come on, come on

Think about all those offers

Come on, come on

Your future with Audrey

Come on, come on

Ain't no time to turn squeamish

Come on, come on

I swear on all my spores

when he's gone, the world will be yours



Come on, come on

It's suppertime
