Suddenly, Seymour


Lift up your head

Wash off your mascara

Here, take my Kleenex

Wipe that lipstick away

Show me your face

Clean as the morning

I know things were bad

But now they're okay



Suddenly Seymour

Is standing beside you

You don't need no makeup

Don't have to pretend

Suddenly Seymour

Is here to provide you

Sweet understanding

Seymour's your friend



[AUDREY]

Nobody ever

Treated me kindly

Daddy left early

Mama was poor

I'd meet a man and

I'd follow him blindly

He'd snap his fingers

Me, I'd say "sure"



Suddenly Seymour

Is standin' beside me

He don't give me orders

He don't condescend

Suddenly Seymour

Is here to provide me

Sweet understanding

Seymour's my friend



[SEYMOUR]

Tell me this feeling lasts till forever

Tell me the bad times are clean washed away



[AUDREY]

Please understand that it's still

Strange and frightnin'

For losers like I've been

It's so hard to say



Suddenly Seymour



[SEYMOUR]

Suddenly Seymour

[AUDREY]

He purified me

[SEYMOUR]

He purified you

[AUDREY]

Suddenly Seymour showed me I can

[SEYMOUR]

Suddenly Seymour showed you you can



[BOTH]

Learn how to be more

The girl that's inside me (you)

With sweet understanding

With sweet understanding

With sweet understanding

Seymour's your man!
