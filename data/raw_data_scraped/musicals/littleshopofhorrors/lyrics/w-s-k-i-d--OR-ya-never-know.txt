W S K I D



[INTERVIEWER]

And thus we conclude our interview with Seymour Krelborn, the young botanical...do you mind if I call you a genious?



[SEYMOUR]

Gosh no!



[INTERVIEWER]

The genious who's developed a new breed of plant life hither to unknown on this planet, the Audrey II! Oh! One last question

Mr. Krelborn. Do you feed it anything special?



[SEYMOUR]

Special? Uh, no. It's a secret formula, but it's uh, not hard to come by.



[INTERVIEWER]

I see. Well thanks for stopping by. It's been a pleasure-



[SEYMOUR]

(Simultaneously) I'd like to remind our listeners that the Audrey II is on display exclusively at Mushnick's Skid Row

Florist Shop, open six days a week...10 to 6!!!



[INTERVIEWER]

Well thank you. This is radio station WSKID.



[MUSHNICK]

The address! The address! Mention the addr- Oh well. It's still great advertising.







Ya Never Know



[CRYSTAL, RONETTE, CHIFFON]

One day he pushed a broom

Nothing in his news but gloom

And doom

Then he lit a fuse and give hime room

Stand aside and watch that

Mothah blow

Explosion! Bang! Kerboom!

Don't it go to show ya never know?



Seymour was in a funk

He was number zero

Whod'a thunk he'd become a hero?

Just a punk, he was a forgotten

so-and-so

Then one day- Crash! Kerplunk!

Don't it go to show ya never know?



[RONETTE]

All the world used to screw him

Biff-wham-pow! Now the interview him

And they clamor to put his remarks

On the air

All the worls used to hate him

Now they're startin' t'appreciate him

All becuase of that strange little plant

Over there



[CRYSTAL, RONETTE, CHIFFON]

Observe him! Here's a chap

Everything is landing in his lap



[SEYMOUR]

I just cut my hand and in a snap

Something out of Edgar Allen Poe has happened



[SEYMOUR, CRYSTAL, RONETTE, CHIFFON]

Zam! Kazap!

Don't it go to show ya never know?



One day you're slinging hash

Feeling so rejected

Lightning flash, you get resurrected

Make a splash- now you rate the big

Bravissimo

And with a thundercrash-

Crash kerplunk, bam kerboom

Zang kazunk, zam kazoom

Zowee powee holy cow he

Ordered up a rainbow to go

Wow! Pow! Lookout below!

Don't it go to show ya never know?
