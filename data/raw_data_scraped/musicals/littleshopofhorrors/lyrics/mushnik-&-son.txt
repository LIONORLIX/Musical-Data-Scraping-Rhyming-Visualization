Mushnik & Son


[MUSHNIK]

How would you like to be my son?

How would you like to be my own

adopted boy?

(I never liked him much before,

But count the cash that's in

the drawer

I've got no choice- I'm much

too poor-)

Say yes



[SEYMOUR]

What for?



[MUSHNIK]

Seymour I want to be your dad

I'll gladly treat you

Like my blood and my own flesh



[SEYMOUR]

Like Ozzie Nelson, Dave and Rick?



[MUSHNIK]

Like Honey Fitz and take your pick



[SEYMOUR]

Then kiss me quick, I'll be your son



[MUSHNIK]

Dont' make me sick, just be my son



[MUSHNIK & SEYMOUR]

Mushnik & Son sounds great

Three words with the ring of fate



[MUSHNIK]

So say you'll incorporate with me

A florist's dream come true

Mushnik and his boychik, you-

What business we'll do for F.T.D.



[MUSHNIK & SEYMOUR]

Like Andy Hardy and the Judge

Like Zeus and Mercury

Like Dumas Fils and Pere



[SEYMOUR]

In trouble sickness and in wealth



[MUSHNIK]

We'll share the plant and share the wealth

I'll call my lawyer



[SEYMOUR]

Call me son



[MUSHNIK & SEYMOUR]

Mushnik & Son, that's that



[SEYMOUR]

Officially I'm your brat



[MUSHNIK & SEYMOUR]

Consider the mnatter closed and done

Now to the world let's stick

Our Senior and Jumior shtick



[SEYMOUR]

Through thin and through thick



[MUSHNIK]

Through sloppy and slick



[MUSHNIK & SEYMOUR]

Through kiss and through kick

Mushnik & Son!
