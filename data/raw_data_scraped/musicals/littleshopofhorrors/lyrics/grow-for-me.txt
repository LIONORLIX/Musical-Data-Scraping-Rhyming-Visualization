Grow for Me


[SEYMOUR]

I've given you sunshine

I've given you dirt.

You've given me nothing

But heartache and hurt.

I'm beggin' you sweetly.

I'm down on my knees.

Oh, please-grow for me!



I've given you plant food

And water to sip.

I've given you potash.

You've given me zip.

Oh God, how I mist you

Oh pod, how you tease

Now, please-grow for me!



I've given you southern exposure

To get you to thrive.

I've pinched you back hard,

Like I'm s'posed ta.

You're barely alive.

I've tried you at levels of moisture

From desert to mud.

I've given you grow-lights

And mineral supplements.

What do you want from me-  Blood?



I've given you sunlight.

I've given you rain.

Looks like you're not happy,

'Less I open a vein.

I'll give you a few drops

If that'll appease.

Now please-oh please-grow for me!
