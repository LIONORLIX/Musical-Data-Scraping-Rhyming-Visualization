Da-Doo


[SEYMOUR]

Da-doo,

I was walkin' in the wholesale flower district that day

Shoop da-doo,

and I passed by this place where this old Chinese man

Chang da-doo

he sometimes sells me weird and exotic cuttings,

Snip da-doo,

'cause he knows, you see, that strange plants are my hobby.

Da da da da da da-doo.



He didn't have anything unusual there that day.



Nope, da-doo,

so I was just about to, ya know, walk on by,

Good for you,

when suddenly,

Da doo

and without warning, there was this total eclipse of the sun.



It got very dark and there was this strange

sound like something from another world.

Da-doo,

And when the light came back this weird plant was just sitting there,



whoop-see-doo

just, you know, stuck in, among the zinnias.

Audrey Two.

I coulda sworn it hadn't been there before,

but the old Chinese man sold it to me anyways,

for a dollar ninety-five.

Sha la la, la la la, la la la loo.
