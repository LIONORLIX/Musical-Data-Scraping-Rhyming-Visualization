Skid Row (Downtown)


[WOMAN]

Alarm goes off at seven

And you start uptown.

You put in your eight hours

For the powers that have always been.

Till it's five P.M.



[BUM 1]

Then You go



[COMPANY]

Downtown

Where the folks are broke.

Downtown

Where your life's a joke.

Downtown

When you buy your token,

you go

Home to skid row.



[BUM 2]

Yes, you go



[COMPANY]

Downtown

Where the cabs don't stop

Downtown

Where the food is slop

Downtown

Where the hop-heads flop

in the snow

Down on Skid Row



Uptown you cater to a million jerks.

Uptown you're messengers and

mailroom clerks

eating all your lunches at the

hot dog carts.

The bosses take your money

And they break your hearts.



Uptown you cater to a million whores.

You disinfect terrazzo on their

bathroom floors.

Your morning's tribulation,

afternoon's a curse

And five o'clock is even worse



[BUM 3]

That's when you go

Where the guys are drips.

Where they rip your slips.

Where relationships are no go.

Down on skid row

Down on skid row

Down on skid row

Down on skid row!



[SEYMOUR]

Poor! All my life I've always been poor.

I keep asking God what I'm for,

and he tells me "Gee, I'm not sure

sweep that floor, kid."

Oh, I started life as an orphan,

a child of the street

Here on skid row.

He took me in, gave me shelter, a bed,

Crust of bread and a job

Treats me like dirt, calls me a slob,

Which I am.

So I live
