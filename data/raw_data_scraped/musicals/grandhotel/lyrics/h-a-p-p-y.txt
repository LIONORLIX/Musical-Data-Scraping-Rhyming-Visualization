H - A - P - P - Y Why

why am I so happy, when I play the Charleston

D - A - N - D - Y Why

Why do I feel dandy, when I dance the Charleston?

Come do the new beat, sweeping through the old world

Warming up a cold world Harlem to China

What began in	Charleston is now done in London

ev'rywhere from Ku'damm to Paris

To Pittsburg to Peking

to Charleston in South Carolina
