"Tu as vu, Jimmy?" "J'ai vu, Jimmy, j'ai vu." - "Qui prefers-tu, Jimmy?" - "Toutes les trois, Jimmy, toutes les trois."



Maybe my baby loves me, loves me, loves me

But if my baby loves me,	Why does she treat me so mean?



Maybe my baby wants me, needs me, craves me

But if my baby craves me Why am I looking so lean?



I can't sleep nights, wond'ring where she is with whom she is, for what!

I worry a lot cause



Maybe my baby loves me, but oh if so

why does my baby leave me cryin' alone in my cot

Maybe my lovin' baby loves me not.

Repeat: .......+

Shoo doodelee doo dab	 Shoo doodelee doo dab



Maybe my baby loves me, but oh, if so	Why does my baby leave me

Crying alone in my cot	 Maybe my loving baby loves me

Maybe my loving baby loves me	Maybe my baby loves me not
