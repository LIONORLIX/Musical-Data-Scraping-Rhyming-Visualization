I Want To Go To Hollywood


What did he see in me?

What's my attraction?

Could that face make a million men adore me?

And make a hundred camera mean explore me?

Is that the girl I see there right before me?



I wanna be that girl in the mirror, there!

I wanna be that girl with gorgeous hair up on a silver screen most everywhere in the world!

I want to go to Hollywood

Talkies - I mean the pictures!



I wanna have a hot time every night,

Go out and raise a little fahrenheit

Knock ev'ry duke and count and baron right off his feet!

I'll be that girl that's understood -oh!

I want to go to Hollywood.



I wanna sing the blues

I wanna wear nice shoes

And drink illegal booze

In every late night spot

for Le Jazz Hot



I want a breakfast, lunch and dinner there

If I'm a big box office winner there

I'll be the most well-known Berliner there ever was

I want to go to Hollywood

So I can get far away from



Fredrichstrasse

My cold water flat,

The sofa that I sleep on behind the screen,

The noisy lodger in the next room,

My broken hand mirror,

My broken coffee pot

If things get broken, they stay broken



In Fredrichstrasse!

The worn-out bristles on your hairbrush,

The pennies needed for the heat ev'ry hour,

And when you get sick, you stay sick



In Fredrichstrasse,

where you live with little soap

And with hardly any hope!



I wanna be that girl in the mirror there!

I wanna be that girl with gorgeous hair

Up on a silver screen most ev'rywhere in the world!



I want to go to Holly-

I want to go

I want to go

I want to go

I want to go

I want to go

I have to go

I have to go

I have to go

I have to go

I have to go



I swear that girl in the mirror

That girl in the mirror

Is going to go to Hollywood!

Hollywood!

Hollywood!

Hollywood!
