The Grand Parade


Velvet stairs, easy chairs

perfumed air gently blowing.

Chandeliers light appears

burning bright, crystal glowing.



People come people go

wave of life overflowing

Come! Begin! In old Berlin,

you're in the Grand Hotel.



Grand Hotel, Grand Hotel	 Music constantly playing.

Grand Hotel, living well,	 where the wealthy are staying.

Round and round, hear the sound	hear what people are saying

It's the din of old Berlin	 You're in the Grand Hotel.

"Grand Hotel, Berlin. Always the same

people come, people go. Look at them.

Living the high life. But time is running out.

Elizaveta Grushinskaya, a fabeled ballerina on her

farewell tour. Raffaela Ottanio, her devoted compagnion.

Hermann Preysing, a business man, reporting to his

stock-holders. Frieda Flaemm, a typist - but not for long.

Otto Kringelein, a book-keeper, looking for "life".

The young and handsome baron Felix Amadeus Benvenuto

von Gaigern, a noble-man - and a thief. There's nothing

more useless on this planet than a noble-man without

money."



Come begin in old Berlin

You're in the Grand Hotel.
