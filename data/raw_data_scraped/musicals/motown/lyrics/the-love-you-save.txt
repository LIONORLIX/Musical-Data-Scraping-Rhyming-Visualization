The Love You Save


[J5:] Stop! Nanana! You'd better save it!

Stop, stop, stop, you'd better save it!



[Michael:] When we played tag in grade school

You wanted to be It.

But chasing boys was just a fad

You crossed your heart you'd quit.



When we grew up you traded

Your promise for my ring

Now just like back to grade school

You're doing the same old thing!



[Chorus:]

Stop! The love you save may be your own!

Darling, take it slow

Or some day you'll be all alone.

You'd better stop the love you save may be your own!

Darling, look both ways before you cross me

You're headed for the danger zone.



[Michael:] I'm the one who loves you!

I'm the one you need!



[Jermaine:] Those other guys will put you down

As soon as they succeed!



[Michael:] They'll ruin your reputation!

They'll label you a flirt!



[Jermaine:] The way they talk about you

They'll turn your name to dirt, oh!



[Michael:] Isaac said he kissed you

Beneath the apple tree

When Benjie held your hand he felt

E-lec-tri-ci-tee!

When Alexander called you

He said he rang your chimes.

Christopher discovered

You're way ahead of your times!



[Chorus]



[J5:]

Slow down.

Slow down.

Slow down.

Slow down.



[Michael:]

S is for "Save it"

T is for "Take it slow"

O is for "Oh, no!"

P is for "Please, please, don't go!"



[Jermaine:] The love you save may be your own...



[Michael:] Some day you may be all alone...



[Jermaine:] Stop it!

[Michael:] Save it, girl!

[Jermaine:] Or some day you'll be all alone.



[Michael:] You'd better stop! the love you save may be your own!

[Jermaine:] Please, please

Or some day, some day baby,

You'll be all alone



Those other guys will put you down as soon as they succeed.



[Michael:] Stop! The love you save may be your own...
