A Breathtaking Guy


One night you held me tight

And whispered in my ear

All night sweet words

I never heard

And I believed every word



Next day you came my way

Without a word to say you passed me by

You didn't bat an eye

My darling won't you tell me why

You're acting strange toward me

Why have you changed toward me



Are you just a breathtaking

First sight soul-shaking

One night love-making

Next day heartbreaking guy



That night your love was true

The next day we were through

Your love was gone

And you were moving on

And I was left to cry alone

What have I done to you

Was it just fun to you



Are you just a breathtaking

First sight soul-shaking

One night love-making

Next day heartbreaking guy



Breathtaking, soulshaking,

Lovemaking, heartbreaking guy

Breathtaking, soulshaking,

Lovemaking, heartbreaking guy
