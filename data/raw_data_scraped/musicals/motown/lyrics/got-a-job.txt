Got a Job


Walked all day till my feet were tired

I was low, I just couldn't get hired

So I sat in a grocery store

"Help is light & I need some more"



(I got a job)

Sha na na na, sha na na na na

(repeat above 2 lines 3 times)

Well, I fin'lly fin'lly fin'lly fin'lly fin'lly (got a job)

Sha na na na, sha na na na na



You've been houndin' me to get a job

Well I finally did & my boss is a slob

He's on my back really all day long

It seems like everything I do is wrong

Well, I fin'lly fin'lly fin'lly fin'lly fin'lly (got a job)

Sha na na na, sha na na na na



(He says to me)

"Get the boxes, take 'em to the basement

Do the job right or I'll get a replacement

Get the mop & clean the dirty floors

& when you're finished wipe the windows & the doors"

I fin'lly fin'lly fin'lly fin'lly fin'lly (got a job)

Sha na na na, sha na na na na



Well, this man's about to drive me stone insane

One of these days I'm gonna have a fit

& though the boss keeps a-runnin' through my brain

I'll never (never) (never) (never) (never never quit my brand new job)

Workin' all day & workin' all night & workin' all day



(repeat previous 2 verses)



(repeat "Workin' all day & workin all night" & fade)
