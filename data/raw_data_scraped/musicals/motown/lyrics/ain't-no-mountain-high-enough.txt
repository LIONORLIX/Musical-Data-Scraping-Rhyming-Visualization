Ain't No Mountain High Enough


Listen, baby

Ain't no mountain high

Ain't no valley low

Ain't no river wide enough, baby



If you need me, call me

No matter where you are

No matter how far

Don't worry, baby

Just call my name

I'll be there in a hurry

You don't have to worry



'Cause baby,

There ain't no mountain high enough

Ain't no valley low enough

Ain't no river wide enough

To keep me from getting to you



Remember the day

I set you free

I told you

You could always count on me

From that day on I made a vow

I'll be there if you want me

Some way, some how



'Cause baby,

There ain't no mountain high enough

Ain't no valley low enough

Ain't no river wide enough

To keep me from getting to you, baby



Oh no, darling

No wind, no rain

No winter storm can stop me baby



No, no baby

If you were ever in trouble

I'll be there on the double

Just stay for me, oh baby



My love is alive

Way down in my heart

Although we are miles apart

If you ever need a helping hand

I'll be there on the double

Just as fast as I can



Baby

There ain't no mountain high enough

Ain't no valley low enough

Ain't no river wide enough

To keep me from getting to you, baby



Don't you know that

There ain't no mountain high enough

Ain't no valley low enough

Ain't no river wide enough

Ain't no mountain high enough

Ain't no valley low enough

Ain't no river wide enough

Ain't no mountain high enough

Ain't no valley low enough...
