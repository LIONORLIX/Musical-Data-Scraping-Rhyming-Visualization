I Got a Feeling


When your in arms, darling

When your in my arms

Oohhh



That feeling, feeling

Got me rockin' and a reelin'

Oh, I'm crazy 'bout your love buttercup

Your kind of love, can't get enough



You shake me, break me

Every time your lips meet mine

I feel a pounding, pounding

Ohh I can't stand it, stand it



When you lock me in, your embrace

And breathlessly, you kiss my face

I get a strange sensation

Ohh I can't stand it, stand it



Ohhh, I get a feeling, feeling

Got me rockin' and a reelin'

Oh, I'm crazy 'bout your love buttercup

Your kind of love, can't get enough



You take control,

Of my very soul,

Every time your close to me

You make me quiver and shake

Ohh I can't stand it, stand it



I touch your lips, your fingertips

I get a loving reaction, soul satisfaction

Darling, you know that

I can't stand it, stand it



Feeling, feeling

And it's got me rockin' and a reelin'

Oh, I'm crazy 'bout your love buttercup

Your kind of love, can't get enough



You're earthquakin', soul shakin'

Ever lovin', breath takin'

You're electrifying, ohhh

Soul satisfying



When you walk, in a room

Right away I start to swoon

I'm not sure of what you got,

But what it is, I like alot



Ohhh, I get a feeling, feeling

Got me rockin' and a reelin'

Oh, I'm crazy 'bout your love buttercup

Your kind of love, can't get enough



Shake me, break me

Every time your lips meet mine

I feel a pounding, pounding

Ohh I can't stand it, stand it



Ohhh, I get a feeling, feeling

Got me rockin' and a reelin'

Ohhh, I'm crazy 'bout your love buttercup

Your kind of love, can't get enough
