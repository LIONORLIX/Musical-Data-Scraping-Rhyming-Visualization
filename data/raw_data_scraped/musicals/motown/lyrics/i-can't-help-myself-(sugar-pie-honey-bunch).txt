I Can't Help Myself (Sugar Pie Honey Bunch)


Sugarpie honeybunch

You know that I love you

I can't help myself

I love you and nobody else

In and out my life

You come and you go

Leaving just your picture behind

And I kissed it a thousand times



When you snap your fingers

Or wink your eye

I come a running to you

I'm tied to you, baby

And there's nothing I can do

Ooh, sugar



Sugarpie honeybunch

I'm weaker than a man should be

I can't help myself

I'm a fool in love you see

Wanna tell you I don't love you

Tell you that we're through

And I've tried

But everytime I see your face

I get up all choked up inside



When I call your name, girl

It starts the flame burning in my heart

Tearin' it all apart

No matter how I try

My love I cannot hide



Sugarpie honeybunch

You now that I'm weak for you

I can't help myself

I love you and nobody else



Sugarpie honeybunch

I'll do anything you ask me to

I can't help myself

I want you and nobody else



Sugarpie honeybunch

You know that I love you

I can't help myself
