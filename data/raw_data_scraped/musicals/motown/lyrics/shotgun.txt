Shotgun


I said,Shotgun shoot em for he runs now

Do the jerk baby

Do the jerk now

Hey!

Put on your red dress

And then you go downtown now

I said buy yourself a shotgun now

We're gonna break it down baby now

We're gonna load it up baby now

And then you shoot him for he runs now

I said,Shotgun shoot em for he runs now

Do the jerk baby

Do the jerk now

Hey!

[Instrumental sax]

I said,Shotgun shoot em for he runs now

Do the jerk baby

Do the jerk now

Hey!

Put on your high heels shoes

I said we're goin' down here listen to em play blues

We're gonna dig potatoes

We're gonna pick tomatoes

I said,Shotgun shoot em for he runs now

Do the jerk baby

Do the jerk now

Hey!

I said it's Twine Time

I said it's Twine Time

I said it's Twine Time

Hey!
