You're Nobody till Somebody Loves You


You're nobody till somebody loves you

You're nobody till somebody cares



You may be king, you may posses the world and it's gold

Gold won't bring you happiness when you're growing old



The world isn't the same, you'll never change it

As sure as the sun shines above you



You're nobody till somebody loves you

So find yourself somebody to love



You're nobody till somebody loves you

You're nobody till somebody cares



You may be king, you may posses the world and it's gold

But gold won't bring you happiness when you're growing old



The world isn't the same, you'll never change it

As sure as the sun shines above you



You're nobody till somebody loves you

So find yourself somebody

You don't need just anybody

Find yourself somebody to love
