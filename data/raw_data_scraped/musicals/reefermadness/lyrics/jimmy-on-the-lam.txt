Jimmy On the Lam


Mae, Sally, Ralph:

Reefer Madness! Pow!

Oo-ee-ah! Bop! Bop!

Madness! Bop! Ba-dop!

Bop! Bop! Bop! Oo-ee-ah!



Mary:

Jimmy, Jimmy, where are you?

Jimmy, Jimmy, where are you?



Jimmy:

Gotta run, gotta hide,

Oh the shame, oh the shame

There's an old man in the gutter

who's been spilled like melted butter

And I, Jimmy Harper, am to blame!



Mary:

Jimmy, Jimmy, where are you?

Jimmy, Jimmy, where are you?



Jimmy:

Think of Mom, think of Pop, and my sweet Juliet!

If I stay I'll only shame them

The authorities will blame them

Out of town's the place I gotta get!



Mae, Sally, Ralph:

Jimmy's off on the lam

where nobody can find him!



Mary:

Jimmy, Jimmy, where are you?

Jimmy, Jimmy, where are you?



Mae, Sally, Ralph:

Train station! Oo oo oo!

Oo oo oo!

Chig! Chigga chigga chigga chug! Chug!

Chigga chug! Chug!



Mary:

Jimmy, Jimmy, where are you?
