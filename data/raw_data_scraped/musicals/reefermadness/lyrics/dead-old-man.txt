Dead Old Man


Jimmy:

There's a story for each wrinkle on your face

There's a dream for ev'ry blessed liver spot

Maybe you fought in the great Civil War

Perhaps you once shook Abraham Lincoln's hand

Who knows?



You're dead, old man

You're dead, old man

Dead old man!



Did a sweetheart used to kiss this weathered skin?

Did these brittle fingers gently stroke her cheek?

Never again will these lips know a smile

This knee you bounced your children upon is drenched with red



You're dead, old man

You're dead, old man

Dead old man!



The wisdom that shone in your aged eyes

I snuffed it out!

Blinded by speed and the reefer smoke

I puffed it out! And in! And out!

And out and in and in and out and out and in and out

Until nothing seemed important anymore!

Not even your sweet life, old man!



Left knackered by a Packard

You bled till dead, old man

Poor dead old man

Dead old man!
