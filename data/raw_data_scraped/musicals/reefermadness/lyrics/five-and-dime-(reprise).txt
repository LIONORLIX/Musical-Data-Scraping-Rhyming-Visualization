Five and Dime (Reprise)


Lecturer:

Kindly Mister Poppy, owner of the shop, he

Led a secret double life of floozies and gin!

I would make a bundle helping Jack to trundle

Little children off to pay the wages of sin!



Well, you never know what evil really lurks

In the hearts of friendly soda jerks!

I'll lead your kids to ruin

'Cuz nasty things are brewin'

Down at the ol' Five and Dime!
