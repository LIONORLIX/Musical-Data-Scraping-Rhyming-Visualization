Listen to Jesus, Jimmy (Reprise)


Jesus:

You didn't

(Listen to Jesus, Jimmy) It's too late for absolution

(Listen to Jesus, Jimmy) I'm just here to watch the execution

(Shoulda listened to Jesus, Jimmy) Guess you thought that I was joking

(Remember Jesus, Jimmy) When your scalp is charred and smoking



Jimmy:

Jesus (Jesus)

If you save me (Gotta save him, Jesus)

I will heed the words you gave me (Go, go, go, gotta save him)



Jesus:

Sorry, your soul is bound for Hell!

Hell, Hell, Hell!

I'm talkin' 'bout your one-way ticket to Hell!



Angels:

Oh yeah!
