The Orgy


Sally:

Smoke the marijuana

Sail the sea of sin

Reach a hot nirvana

Tremble from within



All:

Serve your appetite! Plan to stay the night!



Jimmy:

I am standing at temptation's door

I have never felt this way before!



All:

Join the wonder dance! Lose the underpants!



Jimmy:

Someone save me! There's no place to hide

From this salacious magic carpet ride!



All:

Jimmy, don't be scared

Come and stir the pot!

The meal that we've prepared is hot! Hot! Hot!

Let our legion of lust come demolish your fear!

We attack from the front and engage from the rear!

Bring a tube of flavored lube, it's orgy time!



Goat Man:

Lovely ladies, fresh as morning dew

Sweet as Sodom, we're expe-e-ecting you!



All:

Live the greater life! Give the satyr life!



Sally, Jimmy:

Eros beckons, feel the need increase

Ev'ry fiber burns for sweet release!



All:

Live a little dream! Leave a little mess!

Ev'rybody scream: Yes! Yes! Yes!

Can't you feel the flush of pusling pagan fire

Come and feel the rush

Fly higher and higher



Goat Man:

Dancing naked as the sinful Adam



All:

Voodoo jungle drums!



Sally, Jimmy:

Coupled with a wicked madam till the morning comes!



All:

Yes we're waiting for your business in this carnal carnivale

Take a one way ticket ot the bacchanal

So come on, Jimmy, come on, gimme reefer love!



(dance/orgy break)



Yes we're waiting for your business in this carnal carnivale

Take a one way ticket ot the bacchanal

So come on, Jimmy, come on, gimme reefer love!
