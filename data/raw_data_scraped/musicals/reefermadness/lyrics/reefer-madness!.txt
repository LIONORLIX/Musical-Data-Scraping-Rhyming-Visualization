Reefer Madness!


Lecturer:

Creeping like a communist, it's knocking at our doors

Turning all our children into hooligans and whores

Voraciously devouring the way things are today

Savagely deflowering the good ol' U.S.A.

It's Reefer Madness, Reefer Madness

(Reefer Madness, Reefer Madness)

Oh so mad!



See the kids! Precious kids!

Yes, their heads are on the chopping block

and someone's got to dare to take a stand

Can't ignore any more, it could be your son or daughter

With a deadly stick of reefer in their hand!

They're heading straight for

Reefer Madness! Reefer Madness! Reefer Madness! Reefer Madness!

Save our kids!



Stealthy as a socialist, it slithers up our shores

Turning all our children into hooligans and whores!

This smoking bowl of evil bears the choking stench of sin!

It burrows like a weevil under tender Christian skin!

This...

Reefer Madness! Reefer Madness! Reefer Madness! Reefer Madness!

Oh so mad!



Pull the wool from your eyes!

We're in need of righteous soliders

for this merry wonder has to be destroyed!

Fight the urge of this scourge! It's destructive but seductive!

So some drastic measures need to be employed!

To put and end to...

Reefer Madness! Reefer Madness! Reefer Madness! Reefer Madness!

Oh so mad!



Deadly as the Democrats that empty out our stores!

Turning all our children into hooligans and whores!

Teenagers across the land are glazed and oversexed

If you fail to draw the line, your babies will be next!

Oh! Reefer Madness! Reefer Madness! Reefer Madness! Reefer Madness!

Oh so mad!



Tell your children! (Reefer Madness)

Fight the menace! (Reefer Madness)

Kill the Devil! (Reefer Madness)

Save the country! (Reefer Madness)

Madness! Madness! Madness! Madness! Reefer's made us crazy barking...

Mad!
