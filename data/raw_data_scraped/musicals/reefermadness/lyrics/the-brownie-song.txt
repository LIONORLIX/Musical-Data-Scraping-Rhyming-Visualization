The Brownie Song


Jimmy:

This brownie is yummy!

It's the greatest brownie known to man!

It's chewy! It's nutty!

This brownie's really good!

Don't offer me a macaroon

My brownie suits me fine!

There's frosting on the top,

and best of all, it's mine!



All:

Eat the brownie! Eat the brownie!

Eat the brownie! Eat the brownie!



Jack:

Let's go home!



Jimmy:

Okay!

I shimmer, electric!

I'm a one-man marching brownie band!

I love it, my brownie!

And my brownie loves me too

It's smooth, it's sweet, it's choc'latey!

It forms a perfect square

And the bestest part of all is I don't have to share!



All:

Doesn't have to share!



Jimmy:

The bestest part of all is I don't have to share!



All:

Eat the brownie! Eat the brownie!

Eat the brownie! Eat the brownie!

Yeah!
