The Stuff (Reprise)


Mae:

The kid's a goner

They're gonna make him pay

For the stuff



Jack:

"Here. Simmer down, willya?"



Mae:

I've seen my honor

Rolled up and burnt away

With the stuff

Well, it's gotta stop

"Let go of me!"



Jack:

"Hey, I'm tryin' to comfort you here."



Mae:

"I said let go!"

I should show him the door

He treats me like a whore

I don't need Jack no more

Or the stuff!



Jack:

"You dumb slut! That was half a jay of good mooter you just wasted."



Mae:

"I know."



Jack:

"Mae...whaddya think you're doing with that garden hoe?"



Mae:

"Taking care of a big, fat weed."



Jack:

"That's it. Say goodnight, Gracie."



Mae:

"Goodnight, Gracie."



Jack:

"Oh boy."



Mae:

So this is it, Jack

Last night of ballyhoo

For the stuff



Jack:

"Get away from me, you crazy skirt!"



Mae:

This one's for Ralph, Jack

Here's one for Sally, too

"Had enough?"



Jack:

"Help!"



Mae:

Yeah, you're not so tough!

You once had all the brains

Now they're just carpet stains

You're in no shape to fight

My bid to make things right

'Cause there's blood upon your necktie

Your corpus is delecti

And I have been delivered from the stuff!
