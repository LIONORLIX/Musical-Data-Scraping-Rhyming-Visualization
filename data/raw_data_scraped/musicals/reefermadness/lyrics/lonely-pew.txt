Lonely Pew


Mary:

The service today was really exciting!

Yahweh was mad, and did plenty of smiting!

With locusts and plagues, and little green froggies

All that and more thundered down from the sky

I reached for your hand like I always do

But beside me was just an empty wooden pew



There's hymnals and a rosary

But they don't keep me company

The wafers now don't taste so great

They won't transubstantiate

Without you near the gospel choir sounds askew

Jimmy, come back and fill my lonely pew!



A gloomy church that you're not in can lead a girl to mortal sin!

A lady asked: "Is this seat taken?"

I lied, I guess! I told her, "Yes!"



I pray a holy shining star will lead you home from where you are

In a fog or lost at sea...or could it be you're tired of me?

It's a line of thought I'd rather not pursue!

Jimmy, come back and fill my lonely pew!
