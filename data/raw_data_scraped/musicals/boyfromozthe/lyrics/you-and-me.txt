You and Me


You and me

We wanted it all

We wanted it all

Passion without pain

Sunshine without rainy days

We wanted it all ways



You and me

We reached for the sky

The limit was high

Never giving in

Certain we would(could) win that prize

I should have seen it in your eyes



Look how all our dreams came true

See how I've got me

And baby(See how) you've got you

And thru it all(And after all)

Just one thing died

A little thing called love

A feeling deep inside(We used to feel inside)



You and me

We're not like the rest

We once were the best

(And) Back when we were dumb

When(How) did we become so smart

And learn(We learned) to break each other's hearts



Look how all our dreams came true

See how I've got me

And baby(See how) you've got you

And thru it all(And after all)

Just one thing died

A little thing called love

A feeling deep inside(We used to feel inside)



You and me

We're not like the rest

We once were the best

(And) Back when we were dumb

When(How) did we become so smart

Cause we almost made it



You and me

We're not like the rest

We once were the best

Look what we became

Isn't it a cryin' shame

That we almost made it

But we wanted it all



You and me

We wanted it all
