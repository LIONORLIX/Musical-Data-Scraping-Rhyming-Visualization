Everything Old Is New Again


When trumpets were mellow

And ev'ry gal only had one fellow

No need to remember when

'Cause ev'ry thing old is new again



(Dancin' at) Your Long Island Jazz Age parties

Waiter, bring us more Bacardis

We'll order now what they ordered then

'Cause ev'ry thing old is new again



Get out your white suit, your tap shoes and tails

Let's go backwards when all else(forward) fails

And movie stars you thought were long dead

Now are framed beside your bed



Don't throw the past away

You might need it some rainy day

Dreams can come true again

When ev'ry thing old is new again



Get out your white suit, your tap shoes and tails

Put it in backward when forward fails

But leave Greta Garbo alone

Be a movie star on your own



And don't throw the past away

You might need it some rainy day

Dreams can come true again

When ev'ry thing old is new again



I might fall in love with you again
