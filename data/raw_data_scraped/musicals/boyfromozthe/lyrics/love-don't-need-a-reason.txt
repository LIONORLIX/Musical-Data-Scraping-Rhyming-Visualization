Love Don't Need a Reason


If your heart always did

What a normal heart should do

If you always play a part

Instead of being who you really are



Then(And) you might just miss

The one who's standing there

So instead of passing by

Show him(the someone) that you care

Instead asking why

Why me? And why you?

Why not we two?



'Cause love don't need a reason

Love don't always rhyme

And love is all we have for now

What we don't have is time



If we always believe

All the madness that we're taught

Never questioning the rules

Then we(you)'re living lies we(you) bought so long ago

How are they to know?



It's not who's wrong or right

It's just another way

And I don't wanna fight(It's not about a fight)

But know I'm gonna(It's just I wanna) stay with you till the end

With you my friend



'Cause love don't need a reason

Love don't always rhyme

And love is all we have for now

What we don't have is time



I'll hold you close

Time can't(won't) tear us apart

Forever, I will stand by you

We've(It's) got to start with the beat of one heart

Together, we will(can) see this through



'Cause love don't need a reason

Love's never a crime

And love is all we have for now

What we don't have

What we don't have is time
