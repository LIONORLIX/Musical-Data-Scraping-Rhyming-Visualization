Come Save Me


Come save me

I'm fading fast

Why can't we be together

And maybe I just won't last

If I'm not with you forever



Now I'm touching the stars

And up here on mars

I can rarely breathe



Friends, that's why I smile

'Cause all the while

I've got you up my sleeve



Come take me, I'm ready for

All that I've never tasted

Come wake me, let's make up for

All of the good time we've wasted



Now my heart is at stake

My poor heart could break

I might die if you leave



Friends, ask why I cry

I don't know why

I don't really believe

You'll save me



Come save me



Now I'm touching the stars

And up here on mars

I can rarely breathe



Friends, ask why I smile

'Cause all the while

I've got you up my sleeve



Come save me

Save me, save me, save me

Come save me now
