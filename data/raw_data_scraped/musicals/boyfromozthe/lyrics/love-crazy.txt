Love Crazy


CHRIS

Listen to the music in your voice



PETER

You can hear the music everywhere



Chris

Catch the melody above the noise



PETER

You can feel it pulsing through the air



BOTH

The whole world is buzzin'

And the light from the sun

Combined with ev'rything

All makes me



Love crazy

Livin' is a crazy thing

Love crazy

Energy is ev'rything



PETER

Listen to the music in the water

Don't you see it swim before your eyes



CHRIS

Try to fill it up and full of wonder

How the sun can set and the moon can rise



BOTH

The whole world is buzzin'

And the light from the stars

Combined with ev'rything

All makes me



Love crazy

Livin' is a crazy thing

Love crazy

Energy is ev'rything (repeat)



ALL

Don't cha know the whole world is buzzin'

And the light from the sun

Combined with ev'rything

All makes me



Love crazy

Livin' is a crazy thing

Love crazy

Energy is ev'rything (repeat)
