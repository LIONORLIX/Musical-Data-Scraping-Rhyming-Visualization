Continental American


Once there was a time

When this town was so high

We could never come down

When rules did not apply

We would drink fountains dry

In a club filled with sound

And bands would play to please me

You found a partner easy

The name game was the only game in town



Nights would end at 6 A.M.

Sleep all day

And then start dancing again

The first to see the end

We did the Continental American



All our clothes from France

Soul Train taught us to dance

We had smoke in our eyes

Friends were lost and found

We were Paradise bound

Some got lost, nobody cried

Others took their places

Always strange new faces

Always one more chance to go around



Nights would end at 6 A.M.

Sleep all day

And then start dancing again

The first to see the end

We did the Continental American



Now we're staying in

Let the new dance begin

But those kids look(seem) so young

All dressed up in our clothes

But what none of them knows

Is we really had fun!

When bands would play to please us(me)

You found a partner easy

Scott and Zelda should have seen us then

When nights would end at 6 A.M.

Sleep all day

And then start dancing again

The first to see the end

Manhattan pioneers



We did the Continental American
