If You Were Wondering


(Peter)

If you were wondering

Who I am

I am a man

Just like any other man



(Greg)

Unlike any other man



(Peter)

If you were wondering

Who I was

I was a boy



(Greg)

[spoken]Let me guess?

[sung]Just like any other boy

Starting out on some great mystery



(Peter)

On the road

When I had no choice

I waited out a century

I took a load

Until I ofund my voice

There's nothing wrong with being me



If you were wondering

Who I love

I love you

Caus that's all I hace to do

I'm a man

Just like any other man

Unlike any other man



(Both)

Caus I'm a man

Just like any other man

Unlike any other man
