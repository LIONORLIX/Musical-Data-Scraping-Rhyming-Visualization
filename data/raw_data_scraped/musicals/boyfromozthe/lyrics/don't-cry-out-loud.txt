Don't Cry Out Loud


Baby cried the day the circus came to town

'Cause she didn't like(want) parades just passing by her

So she painted on a smile and took up some clown

And she danced without a net up on the wire

I know a lot about her 'cause you see

Baby is an awful lot like me



We don't cry out loud

We keep it inside

We've learned how to hide our feelings



Fly high and proud

And if you should fall

Remember you almost had it all



Baby saw that when they pulled the big top down

They'd left behind her dreams among the litter

And the different kind of love she thought she'd found

(It) Was nothing more than sawdust and some glitter

But baby can't be broken 'cause you see

She had(has) the finest teacher, me, I taught her



Don't cry out loud

Just keep it inside

Learn how to hide your feelings



Fly high and proud

And if you should fall

Remember you almost had it all
