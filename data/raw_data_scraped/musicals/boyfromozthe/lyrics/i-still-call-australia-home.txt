I Still Call Australia Home


I've been to cities that never close down

From New York to Rio and old London town

But no matter how far

Or how wide I roam

I still call Australia home



I'm always travelin'

And I love bein' free

So I keep leavin' the sun and the sea

But my heart lies waiting over the foam

I still call Australia home



All the sons and daughters spinning 'round the world

Away from their families and friends

Ah, but as the world gets older and colder

It's good to know where your journey ends



And someday we'll all be together once more

When all the ships come back to the shore

Then I realize something I've always known

I still call Australia home



No matter how far

Or how wide I roam

I still call Australia home
