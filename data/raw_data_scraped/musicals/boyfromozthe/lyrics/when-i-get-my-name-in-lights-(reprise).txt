When I Get My Name in Lights (Reprise)


And soon they'll all know my name

I'll have fortune and fame

When I get my name in lights

It can happen overnight in these modern times



I'll sit on a flag pole

Whatever's the rage

Just to get my picture on the front page

Just to get my name in lights
