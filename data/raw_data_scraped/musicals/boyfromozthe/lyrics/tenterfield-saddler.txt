Tenterfield Saddler


(Peter)

The Late George Woolnough worked on High Street

And lived on manners

Fifty two years he sat on his verandah and made his saddles

And if you had questions bout sheep or flowers or dogs

You'd just ask the saddler, he lived without sin

They're building a library for him



Time is a traveller

Tenterfield saddler turn your head

Ride again Jackeroo

Think I see Kangaroo up ahead



The son of George Woolnough went off and got married

And had a war baby

Though something went wrong and it's easier to drink than go crazy

And if there were questions bout why the end was so sad

Well, George had no answers bout why a son

Ever had need of a gun



Time is a traveller

Tenterfield Saddler turn your head

Ride again Jackaroo

Think I see Kangaroo up ahead



The grandson of George has been all around the world

And lives no special place

Changed his last name and he married a girl with an interesting face

He'd almost forgotten them both because in the life that he leads

There's no where for George and his library or the son with his gun

To belong except in this song



Tim is a meddler

Tenterfield  saddler make your bed

Fly again Cockatoo

Down on the ground Emu up ahead



Time is a tale-teller

Tenterfield Saddler make your bed

Fly again Cockatoo

Think I see Kangaroo up ahead



Time is a traveller

Tenterfield Saddler turn your head

Ride again Jackaroo

Think I see Kangaroo up ahead.
