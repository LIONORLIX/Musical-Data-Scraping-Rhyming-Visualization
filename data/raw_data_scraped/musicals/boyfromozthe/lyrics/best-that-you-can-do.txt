Best That You Can Do


Once in your life you find her

Someone thatt turns you heart around

And next thing you know you're closing down the town

Wake up and it's still with you

Even though you left you went cross town

Wondering to yourself, "Hey, what've I found?"



When you get caught between the moon and New York city

I know it's crazy, but it's true

If you get caught between the moon and New York city

Best that you can do ......

Best that you can do is fall in love



Arthur he does as he pleases

All of his life, he's mastered choice

Deep in his heart, he's just, he's just a boy

Living his life one day at a time

Showing himself a really good time

Laughing about the way they want him to be



When you get caught between the moon and New York city

I know it's crazy, but it's true

If you get caught between the moon and New York city

Best that you can do .....

Best that you can do .....

Best that you can do is fall in love



When you get caught between the moon and New York city

I know it's crazy, but it's true

If you get caught between the moon and New York city

Best that you can do .....

Best that you can do .....

Best that you can do is fall in love



When you get caught between the moon and New York city

I know it's crazy, but it's true

If you get caught between the moon and New York city

The best that you can do .....

Best that you can do .....

Best that you can do is fall in love
