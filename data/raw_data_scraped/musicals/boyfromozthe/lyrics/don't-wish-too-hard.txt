Don't Wish Too Hard


Don't wish too hard for what you want

Or then you might get it

And then when you get it

You might wish you never got it all



Don't keep(go) looking for love to come

Or then it might find you

And then when it finds you

You might wish that you had never been born



How I wished for you and now you're here

Now I wish that I could disappear and go away



My poor heart's repeating it

Can't stand the beating it's been taking

I can't tell if you're faking

Every time you're making love to me



One day soon I'm going to change

My tune and without hesitating

I'll be leaving you waiting

And you'll find that what you really wanted

And what you end up getting you never really

Wanted at all



Then you'll wish for me and I won't be here

So long darlin' I'll just disappear and go away
