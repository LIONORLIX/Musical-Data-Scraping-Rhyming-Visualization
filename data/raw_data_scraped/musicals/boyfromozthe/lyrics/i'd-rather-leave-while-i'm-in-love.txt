I'd Rather Leave While I'm in Love


I'd rather leave while I'm in love

While I still believe the meaning of the word

I'll keep my dreams and just pretend

That you and I were never gonna(meant to) end



Too many times I've seen the rose die on the vine

Somebody's heart gets broken

Usually it's mine

I don't wanna take the chance of being hurt again

And you and I can't say goodbye



So if you wake and find me gone

Hey babe, just carry on

You see I need my fantasy

I still believe

It's best to leave while I'm in love



I'd rather leave while I'm in love
