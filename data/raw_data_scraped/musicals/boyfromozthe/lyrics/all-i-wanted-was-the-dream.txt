All I Wanted Was the Dream


All I wanted was the dream

Just like anybody else

I didn't want it pushed aside

Forgotten on a shelf



I wanted laughs and lots of lovers

And limitless wealth

I just want to say you're better

Than anybody else



All I wanted was the time

To obliterate my past

I didn't know that time can come and go

So terribly fast



It's hard to lose it

When you had it right here

In your grasp

But then you wake up and it seems

The dream that you dream

Was just too good to last
