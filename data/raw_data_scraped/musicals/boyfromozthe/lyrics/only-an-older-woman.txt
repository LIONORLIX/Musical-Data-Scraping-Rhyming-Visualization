Only an Older Woman


JUDY

You need an older woman to teach you

One who is barely reaching her prime

Who thinks you're fun

Not someone to preach to

What do you say - let's have a good time

'Cause with an older woman

Nothing you do is a crime

(spoken:) You have the makings of a monster, kid. I like that.



PETER (spoken)

I 'm not sure what you mean?



JUDY (spoken)

Hang around. You'll learn. You really want to come to New York?



PETER (spoken)

It's all I've ever wanted.



JUDY (spoken)

Then you're in big trouble.



PETER

I'm waiting-

I need an older woman beside me

I need a mentor



JUDY

I need a drink



PETER

I want an older woman to guide me



CHRIS

Where are we headed?



MARK

Where do you think?



JUDY

Over the goddamn rainbow



PETER, CHRIS & MARK

Right down the yellow brick road



PETER

And whadda-ya-know, I've found my ideal woman



ALL

Only one who's been 'round the block

Can give you the ride you need



PETER, CHRIS & MARK

Always there absorbing the shock



JUDY

One built for comfort



PETER, CHRIS & MARK

Not for speed



ALL

Stir up a flame from out of the embers

I sense a fire starting in you



PETER, CHRIS & MARK

What do ya say to making some mem'ries



JUDY

Out of the old



PETER, CHRIS & MARK

Comes something that's new

Maybe an older woman

Is going to help us break through



JUDY

As for me, I just can't wait to see her



PETER, CHRIS & MARK

Honestly, we were hoping you might be her



ALL

Eventually - when you get to be an older woman



JUDY

Like me
