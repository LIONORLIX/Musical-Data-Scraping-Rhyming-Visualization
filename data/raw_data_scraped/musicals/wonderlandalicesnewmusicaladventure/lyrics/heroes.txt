Heroes


White Rabbit: (softly) Chances they come and go.

But you're afraid and so, you run away.



Cheshire Cat: (softly) And when a chance is there, make believe you don't care. That's how to play.



Caterpillar: (softly) Bridges you never crossed, left you alone and lost. looking around.



White Knight: (softly) People are hard to find, when they get left behind on such angry ground.



All: (softly) So it goes..



Alice: The hours move, the days go by. We wait for heroes to fall from the sky.

Don't wait too long, to learn whats true.

I promise you'll be a hero for me, and I'll be a hero for you.



Nothing is black or white,

Easy is wrong or right

Or so they say.

You were the best of me, saving the rest of me, day after day.



Hold on to those you love,

Through what you're dreaming of,

You'll make it somehow!

The future can change the past, make every second last.

For all we have, is here and now!



(Chorus) The hours move the days go by, why wait for heroes to fall from the sky?



Alice: I finally know, what's really true.

I promise you'll be a hero for me, and I'll be a hero for you!



(Chorus echoes) I'll be a hero for you, I'll be a hero, I'll be a hero,

A hero... for you!

...

The hours move, the days go by, why wait for heroes to fall from the sky?

The hours move, they days go by, I'll be your hero...

(softly) The hours move the days go by, why wait for heroes to fall?...



Alice: (softly) The hours move, the days go by.

Why wait for heroes to fall from the sky?
