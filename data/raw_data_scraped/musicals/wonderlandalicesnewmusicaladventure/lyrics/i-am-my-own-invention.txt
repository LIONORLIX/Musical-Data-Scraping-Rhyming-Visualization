I Am My Own Invention


THE VICTORIAN GENTLEMAN:

Nothing can exist 'til you dream it first, everyone knows this.

Then, it will arrive, new and unrehearsed, vivid as a kiss.

Dreamers and children can conjure things easily,

Things their eyes, though they're closed, can see.

Not the way things are, but how they should be, this is what is true.

Wish upon a star, close your eyes and see all that you can do.

Try to remember the way you were when you were her,

The little girl that's there inside of you.

I am my own invention,

Meeting each day anew.

Can you imagine being your own invention, too'



Dreams will always start with a happy end waiting to come true



ALICE:So long ago



THE GENTLEMAN:

Lucid as a heart, welcome as a friend, gossamer and new.



ALICE:

Help me so I can remember dreams to share,

With dreams to spare, imagining a dreamer just like you.



BOTH:

I am my own invention.

Finally I can see.



THE GENTLEMAN:

I am my own invention



ALICE:

I am my own invention



THE GENTLEMAN:

Tomorrow can't be



BOTH:

All it should be,

'Til I've invented me.
