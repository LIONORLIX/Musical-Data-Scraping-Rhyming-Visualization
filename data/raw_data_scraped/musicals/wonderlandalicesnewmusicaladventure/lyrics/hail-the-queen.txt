Hail the Queen


Queen of Hearts:

To be a proper subject one must ever proper be

And not just when the monarchs dropping by for tea

Which by the way reminds me was my invitation lost



White Rabbit:

Perhaps the palace mailroom got the signals crossed



Queen of Hearts:

Well in either case they face disgrace so

Lets begin the executions (yes in either case they face disgrace, all hail the queen)

And you young lady who are you

I don?t believe we?ve met



Alice:

I?m from the land of credit cards and endless debt



Queen of Hearts:

I see that sounds an awful place

No wonder you?ve come here

No matter here or there let me make one thing clear

If you anger me there?ll be no tea and

Very little sympathizing (there will be no tea says her majesty all hail the queen)



White Knight:

Your majesty is right of course



Queen of Hearts:

Of course I am I am the source

And will not trouble those who disagree



White Knight:

Like tweedledum and tweedledee

She will heartedly agree your highness



Alice:

I do agree your majesty

If I agree is there a fee?



Queen:

There will be if you sing the song appease



White Knight:

We crave a boon from you my queen

More of a royal favor



Queen:

Rather large or small or none at all

You must be careful what you wish for (whether large or small or none at all)



Everyone:

All hail the queen
