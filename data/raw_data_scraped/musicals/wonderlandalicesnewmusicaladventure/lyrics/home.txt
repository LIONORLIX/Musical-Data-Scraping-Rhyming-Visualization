Home is not a place

An address you memorize

Its more than central park

Or apartment 8a

It's where you never feel lonely

Whenever you're alone

That's how you know you are home



How i wish that i could feel that

Once more

Right now

How i wish that you could find it again

Home is like a smile you see in a photograph

No matter what you do

Its not supposed to change

I really need you to be here because you want to be



Back on the ground no more racing around

Here safe and sound with me
