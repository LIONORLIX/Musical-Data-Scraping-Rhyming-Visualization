Once More I Can See


Long ago and oh so far away

There were dreams that i recall

Full of unicorns who loved to play

Behind my garden walls

And the clouds would look like dragons tails

As they moved across the sky

And a tree could be the Prince of Wales

And little girls could fly



I remember every moment

How it was to just be me

And to my surprise

I look through your eyes

And once more i can see



I remember living in between

What was real and what is not

'Neath a sky of blue and a field of green

I long ago forgot

I remember rabbits running late

Underneath my mother's fence

And a singing cup and a talking plate

Who somehow both made sense

I remember every moment

I remember being free

And to my surprise

I look through your eyes

And I remember me



For somewhere deep inside me

There's a girl from way back when

She just needs your heart to guide me

And make her see again



I remember every moment

When my heart was young and free

And to my surprise

I look through your eyes

And once more I can see
