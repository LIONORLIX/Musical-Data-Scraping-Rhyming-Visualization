Off with Their Heads!


It's off with their heads

It's the least i can do

Off with their heads

Is the only phrase that always rings true

Never gets old

So i say to you

With conviction

Off with their heads

It's my one real milieu

Every one dreads what the queen may say

Though hats they may doff

It will be off with their heads

I try to be even and fair

But as you see

I'm almost never

All quite there



Noblesse oblige

My derrier



When i demand all must adhere

I wave my hand and all my courtiers appear

And when they don't or if they won't

Loud and clear it's off with their heads

I don't care what they've done

Off with their heads

Is my first and second

Rule number one

Once you've begun well it's so much fun

All together

Off with their heads is a mantra of mine

Off with their heads is my bottom line

And if you dare scoff, well then it's off with your head

Don't need a congress or a constitution

For its a forgone conclusion

That every problem has the same solution

Persuade crusade with a

Custom made renewable

Doable and unmisconstruable

Stainless steel blade



Off with their heads

It's the least i can do

Off with their heads

Is the only phrase that always rings true



Baby it's off off off off off off off off off off

With their heads

Off with their heads

Off with their heads
