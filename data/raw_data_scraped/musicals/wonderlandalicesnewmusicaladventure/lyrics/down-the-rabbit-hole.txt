Elevator Voice: Just look out below...

Alice: Fear and doubt, freaking out! dropping way too fast!

Elevator Voice: (spoken) Just relax, enjoy the view!

Alice: (spoken) You've got to be kidding me!

Elevator Voice: (laughing) Relax

Alice: How long will this last? Down and down I go to god knows where!...

Elevator Voice: It's a special place, with a lot space and, special people!

Alice: Down I go although, when I get there! (spoken) can you tell me when I'll get home again?

Elevator Voice: Well that's really up to you!
