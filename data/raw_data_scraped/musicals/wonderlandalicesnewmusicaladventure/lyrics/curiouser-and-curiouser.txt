Curiouser and Curiouser


Spoken: I don?t understand this place!

In fact, it gets curios-er and curios-er



Curios-er and Curios-er and Curios-er am I

First I grow too li-ttle

And then I grow too high

Wonder what I?m do-ing here

I think I?m going to cry

Oh Curios-er and Curios-er am I!



(Weeping)



Spoken: Oh now what?s happening?

I seem to be surrounded by water

Have I fallen into the sea?

NO, I?ve cried so much I?m about to be drowned in my own tears!

I have to swim!!



Curios-er and Curios-er

I?m up to my ears,

Swimming in my own little ocean of te-ars

Could it be? It seems to me,

a mouse? Is swimming

Oh Curios-er and Curios-er am I
