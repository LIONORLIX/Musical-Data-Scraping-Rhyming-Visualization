Welcome to Wonderland


Welcome to Wonderland

My god it's half past eight

Who cares if you came late

We don't care where you've been

You're gonna fit right in

A little fun detour

A little crazy, sure

Don't get all insecure



Pardon me, but have you seen

Someone looking like a queen?

Sharpening a guillotine

Prob'ly just as well (Ha!)

She's capricious as can be

Lopping heads of by decree

This week severed forty-three

Cutting them pell mell



What a party has it started snowing?

Everyone not coming will be going

Do you know the queen of hearts new orders?

They're the same as always; close the boarders

Could she be the one, you know?

Tin man, lion or scarecrow?

Wait that's from a different show



ALICE:

Please start making sense



Have you seen my walrus dear?

Big mustache that's down to here

Made the oysters disappear

Claiming self-defense



ALICE:

Wait, I think you think I think I'm dreaming

And when I wake up I'll wake up screaming



We don't think as all we simply feel dear



ALICE:

Ok, someone tell me what's the deal here



Welcome to Wonderland

This is your new address

You'll love it more or less

No time to decompress



It's afternoon all day

There's lots of games to play

Flamingo lawn croquet

So please enjoy your stay



Everyday it's something new

Problems up the old wazoo

Rumors of a palace coup



ALICE:

Get me out of here



Answers are in short supply

Who, what, where, when, how or why

Cross my heart and hope to die

Get it into gear



When your alter-ego's interfering

Self-esteem cannot stop disappearing



Welsome to Wonderland

Start rocking with the band

You're going so damn fast

Your future's in your past

An author always knows

Which way the story goes

So tidy up loose ends

With a little help from your friends



Come on and sing along

Join our little band

Turn up the volume and keep on dancin'

Sit back, enjoy yourself and feel the river flow

Make sure the journey's worth the things you're chancin'

We're all a little nuts in case you

Ooblee, Ooblah

We'd love to stay here but we really gotta go

Ooblee, Oohblah



Life can be fantastic every minute

For as long as you can just stay in it



Welcome to Wonderland

Where everything you see

I mean from "A" to "Z"

Ain't what it seems to be

Welcome to Wonderland

Set phasers up to stun

Turn off the lights when done

Good luck and thanks a ton

Ciao, baby, gotta run
