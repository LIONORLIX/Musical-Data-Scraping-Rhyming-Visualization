I Will Prevail


A child believes the best in you,

And that belief

Always makes the darkest lies

Seem almost true.

With slight of hand,

This almost truth

Can beguile the purest youth

To Wonderland.



Now every piece is in place

And all that’s left to erase

Before I take over all the power,

Is every trace of dear Alice

Then the Queen,

She’s been a thorn in my side

And she can run but can’t hide

We’re fast approaching

The witching hour

And settling scores

Is my routine.



Oh well, all’s well ends well,

Farewell Alice!

Too late,

Checkmate is your fate -

It’s over!

I come alive

When you’re afraid!

I’ll write the ending

Of your tragic Fairytale,

I will survive,

And you will fade.

A withered flower small and frail,

While I prevail.



This time it’s gonna be me

The last thing you’ll ever see,

An Armageddon of my devising,

There’s no way you can escape

From what I do.

So leave your half-hearted souls

For me to bully and rule,

The sly magician

Of compromising,

To conjure all that is false

Until it’s true.



Poor Jack, black Jack

Sad sack, fallen Hero,

Bad news, you lose,

Light the fuse,

It’s over!

You die, I thrive

And so it goes.

I am the ending

Of your tragic Fairytale,

I will survive,

And Heaven knows

There is no way that I can fail,

I will prevail!
