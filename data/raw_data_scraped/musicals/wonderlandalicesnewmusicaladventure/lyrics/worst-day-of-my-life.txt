Worst Day of My Life


It's gonna be the worst day

It's gotta be the worst day of my life

Nothing fits, my hairs a mess,

Shoes don't match my purse or dress

Somebody shoot me

Oh my god i'm running late again

One more dog and pony show

Talk to people i don't know



My agent says i've gotta schmooze

If i expect my book reviews

To get some quotes that we can use

Another party that's long and boring,

A little food and a lot of snoring

While i give a speech on my literary life

Another night where i leave my daughter

And spend it drinking imported water

While i simulate perfect mother perfect wife

Another worst day of my life



It's gonna be the worst day

Its gonna be the worst day

Of my life



I'm not the star they say i am

Just one more pathetic sham

I'll never make it

How can i expect to hold this pose

Mother, writer, wife, or friend

Where does one begin or end?



O god i feel like such a fraud,

Like every inch of me is flawed

But still i smile while they applaud

My life has gotten so complicated

So underwhelming and overrated

I can feel the heat but i still can't see the light

And will i ever get out from under

The ?silver pen? Of a one hit wonder

Who's so full of fear you can cut it with a knife

This is the worst day of my life



It's always slightly out of reach

What i can't learn and they can't teach

And now i've got to make this speech



O god i feel like such a fraud

Like every inch of me is flawed

But still i smile while they applaud



I wish that i had never heard of,

Or ever read a single word of

Lewis carroll and his fabulous career

I wish that i was not related to alice littel

Or celebrated

And i wish to god i was anywhere but here

Just so we're absolutely clear



My life has gotten so complicated

So underwhelming and overrated

I can feel the heat but i still cant see the light no no no

I think i'll never get out from under the ?silver pen?

Of a one hit wonder who's so full of fear you can cut it with a knife

This is the worst day of my



A shooting star that's all out of ammo

The not so grand of a grand piano

While i ran away from what i really want to say

I think i can and i hope i make it

Don't think i can so i guess ill fake it

And without a doubt i can do without the strife

This is the worst day

The very worst day

This is the worst day of my life
