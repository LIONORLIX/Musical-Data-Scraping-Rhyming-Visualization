Mad Tea Party


Tea party guests:

Hello. Good bye. Lets see if pigs can really fly!

You know the tea is all the way from India,

You see, and though that isn't near it tastes as though we grew it here.

Low tea, high tea, drink your own but don't drink my tea!



Well if there's tea then it must be summer time in the late afternoon!

Make a pot, for if its not then it'll be time for tea pretty soon!



March Hare: (spoken) whip up straight through the Apocalypse name of the reservation?

Alice: (spoken) Alice.

March Hare: (spoken) Goody!
