Rotti:

Shilo, you've made it.

You're close enough to taste it.

Your cure is waiting.

There is but one thing pending:

Help us catch him,

This former geneco trainee

Who's lost his mind completely,

And managed to escape me.

You saw him in the graveyard.

Thank god my guards responded

It seems this fiend has set his teeth on you.

So, be on guard, he's coming!

We used you as bait

To draw this snake out of his hole.

And i am sorry, shilo, for that,

But this is your defining moment.

Will you let yourself be trapped?

Or will you use the trap to trap him?

Bring me repo man,

And you will get your cure.
