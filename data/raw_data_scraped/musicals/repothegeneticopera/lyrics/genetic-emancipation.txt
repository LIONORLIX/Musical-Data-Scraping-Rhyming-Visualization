Genetic Emancipation


Years.

It's been so many years.

Resenting the years in my heredity.



Oh, I have hated and loved you

I have hidden behind you

but I finally see.



You, I've mistaken for destiny

but the truth is my legacy is not up to my genes.

True, though the imprint is deep in me

it will always be up to me.

Up to me.



Oh, ohhhhhhhhhhh, ohhhhhhh.

Free at last.

Oh, ohhhhhhhhhhh, ohhhhhhh.

Free at last.
