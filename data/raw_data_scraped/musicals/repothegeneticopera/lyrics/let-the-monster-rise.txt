Let the Monster Rise


Nathan:

Didn't I tell you not to go out?

Didn't I?



Shilo:

You did

You did



Nathan:

Didn't I say the world was cruel?

Didn't I?



Shilo:

You did

You did



Nathan:

Then tell me how this happened, what I did wrong, tell me why

Can we just go home, Shi, and forget this dreadful night?



Shilo:

Didn't you say that you were different?

Didn't you?



Nathan:

I am

I am



Shilo:

Say you aren't that person

Say it



Nathan:

I am

I am



Shilo:

Then tell me how to act, dad

What to say, dad

Tell me why

Everything you've told me

Every word

Is a lie



Didn't you say that you'd protect me?

Didn't you?



Nathan:

I tried

I tried



Shilo:

Is that how you'd help me?

Is it?



Nathan:

I tried

I tried



Shilo:

Don't help me any more, dad

You are dead, dad, in my eyes

Someone has replaced you

Dad, I hate you

Go and die!



Nathan:

Didn't I build a house, a home, didn't I?

Didn't I raise her all alone, didn't I?

Then Rotti took her from me

Stole my Shilo

He's to blame

Have I failed my daughter?



Then let the father die!

And let the monster rise!
