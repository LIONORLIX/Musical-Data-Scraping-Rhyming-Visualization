Infected


I'm...infected

I'm infected

by your genetics



Shilo, I'm the doctor

Shilo, I'm your father

Oh, Shilo, that was close!

Take your medicine



I'm infected by your genetics

Shilo, you're my patient

Shilo, be more patient

You have limitations, don't go chasing flies

I must be protective

You cannot be reckless

That's what is expected when you are infected



I'm infected by your genetics

I'm infected by your genetics

And I don't think that I can be fixed

No, I don't think that I can be fixed

Tell me why, oh why are my genetics such a bitch?



It's this blood condition

Damn this blood condition!

Mother can you hear me?

Thanks for the disease!

Now I am sequestered

Part of the collection

That's what is expected when you are infected



That's what is expected when you are infected

That's what is expected when you are infected



How much of it's genetics?

How much of it is fate?

How much of it depends on the choices that we make?

He says I have her eyes, did I also inherit his shame?

Is heredity the culprit?

Can I stop it, or am I a slave?



I'm infected by your genetics

I'm infected by your genetics

What hope has a girl who is sick?

My dream of a life past this fence

It really makes no difference

'Cause I know that I'll never be fixed

Tell me why, oh why are my genetics such a bitch?



Oh, I want to go outside

Outside

Oh, I want to go outside

Outside
