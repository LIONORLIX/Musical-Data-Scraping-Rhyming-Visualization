What Chance Has A 17 Year Old Girl




Nathan:

Your mother's death taught me to accept

That nothing ever lasts in this world.

Foolish dreams can destroy a grown man.

What chance has a 17 year old girl?



Shilo:

I don't know what i was thinking.

There's no sense in girlish dreaming.

I'm just 17, 17...

And it's better than 40!
