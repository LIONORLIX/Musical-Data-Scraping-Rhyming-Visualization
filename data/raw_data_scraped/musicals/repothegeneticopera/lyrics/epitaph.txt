Epitaph


Graverobber:

Goth opera

Blood saga

Sometimes i wonder how we ever got here

Old grudges

Scorn lovers

Sometimes i wonder why we all don't move on



Cause we all end up in a tiny pine box

A mighty small drop in a mighty dark plot

And the mighty fine print hastens the trip to our epilogue (epilogue!)

But the little girl fled and the king is dead

And the castle is left for the taking

But geneco may survive if it undergoes surgery, surgery?



(surgery surgery)

(i can't feel nothing at all)

(surgery surgery)
