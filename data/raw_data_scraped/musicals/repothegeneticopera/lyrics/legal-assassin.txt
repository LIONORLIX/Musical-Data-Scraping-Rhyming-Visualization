Legal Assassin


Dead marni’s voice:

Nathan...nathan! Nathan!



Nathan:

Where did our daughter go?

It’s me she must escape.

My burdens i can’t erase.

The mother i might have saved.



Ghostly whispers:

Assassin...murderer...monster...



Nathan:

Marni, i need you now.

Look what i’ve become.

The nightmare that she should fear

Is the father you left alone.



Ghostly whispers:

Assassin...murderer...monster...

Assassin...murderer...monster...

Assassin...murderer...monster...



Nathan:

The years roll by without you, marni.

17 have come and gone.

I raised our shilo with the best intentions.

But there is something i can’t tell her.

I am lost without you here.

I am only living out a lie!



Nathan:

But shilo can never leave!

She is my everything!

Nothing can bring you back!

Shilo is all i have!



Ghostly whispers:

Assassin...murderer...monster...

Assassin...murderer...monster...

Assassin...murderer...monster...



Nathan:

The years roll by without you, marni.

17 have come and gone.

I raised our shilo with the best intentions,

But there is something i can’t tell her.

I am lost without you here.

I am only living out a lie!



I’m the monster!



Ghostly whispers:

Assassin!



Nathan:

I’m the villain!



Ghostly whispers:

Assassin!



Nathan:

What perfection!



Ghostly whispers:

Assassin!



Nathan:

What precision!



Ghostly whispers:

Assassin!



Nathan:

Keen incisions, i deliver!

Unscathed organs, i deliver!

Repossessions, i deliver!

I’m the repo, legal assassin!

Ghostly whispers:

Assassin! Assassin!

Assassin! Assassin!

Assassin! Assassin!

Assassin! Assassin!
