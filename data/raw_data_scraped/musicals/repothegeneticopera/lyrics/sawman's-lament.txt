Sawman's Lament


Rotti:

You've exceeded all my plans



Luigi:

More then you could say for amber



Rotti:

More then i could say for you



Luigi:

What?



Rotti:

Or your just as worthless brother



Shiloh:

I just want to get my cure



Rotti:

And i promise to deliver



Nathan:

Don't you lay a hand on her



Rotti:

Hold your tongue before an elder



Nathan:

Touch her and i swear i'll kill you



Rotti:

Bring it on you cheap imposter

Even though im terminally ill

Im dying you idiots



Luigi/pavi:

Please don't say you're dying father



Rotti:

So i planned my perfect end



Luigi/pavi:

A tale befitting any opera



Rotti:

An ending only i could spend



Nathan:

Ending you will be my pleasure



Shiloh:

I no longer trust you dad



Luigi/pavi:

You can never trust a monster



Rotti:

And there's more beneath his mask



Luigi/pavi:

Did you know he killed your mother?



Nathan:

It was just an accident



Shiloh:

What



Luigi/pavi:

Just as he's been killing you



Nathan:

Shiloh please believe me



Rotti:

Is that not his greatest fib



Shiloh:

Someone tell me what is going on



Rotti/luigi/pavi:

Tell her! Tell her!



Shiloh:

Someone tell me what is going on



Everyone:

Tell her! Tell her!



Nathan:

Let's leave! Let's leave!



Everyone:

Tell her! Tell her!



Shiloh:

Someone tell me what is going on



Everyone:

Tell her! Tell her!



Shiloh:

Tell me! Tell me! Tell me!
