Nathan:

Keep it down, shi.



Shilo:

Come back!



Nathan:

It's your bedtime. It's late.



Shilo:

Dad, i'm fine.



Nathan:

It's late.



Shilo:

She will die!



Nathan:

Nonsense.



Shilo:

It's her eyes, dad!



Nathan:

Nonsense.



Shilo:

It's a contract!



Nathan:

Contract?



Shilo:

Come and see.



Nathan:

Nonsense.



Shilo:

Come see! Mag's in trouble, dad!



Nathan:

Where'd you get this?



Shilo:

Read it, dad,

Read it dad. A repo man will come and take mag's eyes!



Nathan:

There are things in life that we'd do best to leave alone



Shilo:

She'll die! You must help her, dad!



Nathan:

That are beyond control



Shilo:

She'll die! You must stop her, dad!



Nathan:

That you don't want to know



Shilo:

Please dad, will you save mag?!

She will lose her eyes unless you stop this repo man!



Nathan:

Shilo, this is senseless.



Shilo:

Dad, you have to try!



Nathan:

Shilo, this is pointless.



Shilo:

You can't let her die!



Nathan:

Shilo, please shut up!
