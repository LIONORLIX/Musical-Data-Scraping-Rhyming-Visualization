Gold


Rotti:

Flesh is weak.

Blood is cheap.

Inconsistent, consistently.

Use your sense.

Save your cents.

The only thing with persistence is



Gold, it makes the world go 'round.

Gold, it makes the world go 'round.



Carved my niche,

Rags to rich.

Made a fortune, and counted it.



Asked for heirs,

Got nightmares -

Degenerates who would waste every cent of my



Gold, it makes the world go 'round

Gold, it makes the world go 'round.



But, before i go,

My kids will know

About the man they have crossed.

As marni did,

The day she fled

And became nathan's wife.

She forced my hand.

He dug her grave.

I will not be betrayed!

Empty the trash

Of all of them,

And leave it all to the kid!



Lay the bait,

Shilo's fate.

But only if earned will she appreciate that



Gold, it makes the world go 'round.

Gold, it makes the world go 'round.

Gold!
