Aching Hour


Mag:

In my aching hour

As I stand to face myself

In this final hour

Bitter fate I accept



This must be my - my aching hour

(This must be my aching hour)

This must be my - my aching hour

(This must be my aching hour)



Tonight I will settle all my debts

Tonight I will sever ties

Tonight I am coming to collect

Tonight I will sing my life



I've made my peace

All debts are paid

At the opera tonight
