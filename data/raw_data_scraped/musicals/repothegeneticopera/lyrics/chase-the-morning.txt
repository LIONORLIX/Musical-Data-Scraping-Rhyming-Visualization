Chase the Morning


Blind mag:

Shilo...? Is your name Shilo?

Can i talk to you?

Can you come down please...

So we can speak?

I saw you at the show.

I thought i'd seen a ghost.

Your resemblance is striking.

You have your mother's eyes,

Her hair.

I was told you died with her.

All these years have come and gone.

How do i put this...?

I'm your godmom.



Shilo:

State your business.



Blind mag:

Business?



Shilo:

What do you want?



Blind mag:

I want, i want to finally meet you -

Something real to cling to.

Leave you with the hope that

You will go do all you're meant to,

All i've failed to.

In you, is a world of promise.

We have both been kept in bondage,

But you can learn from all my failures.



Shilo:

I'm not supposed to talk to strangers.



Blind mag:

Or let them through the gate?



Shilo:

That either. A big risk.



Blind mag:

A big fence.



Shilo:

A mistake.



Blind mag:

A new friend.







Dead marni:

Chase the morning.

Yield for nothing.

Chase the morning.

Yield for nothing.



Shilo:

How'd you do that?



Blind mag:

Do what?



Shilo:

Do that. That, that eye thing.



Blind mag:

These eyes can do more than see.



Shilo:

I know--i mean, i've seen you sing.



Blind mag:

Where?



Shilo:

From my window.

I can see the world from there.

Name the stars and constellations.

Count the cars and watch the seasons.



Blind mag:

I wish we could've watched together.



Shilo:

I can't have guests.



Blind mag:

Never?



Shilo:

Ever. If dad found out

That i'd been let out,

Or you'd been let in...



Blind mag:

I should go then.

Before i do, promise me you won't--



Shilo:

It's better that you-



Shilo:

Don't. Forget me.



'Best

If i resume my life inside

My bedroom.



Blind mag:

Don't forget that

A sheltered rose needs a

Little room to bloom

Outside her bedroom.



Dead marni:

Chase the morning.

Yield for nothing.

Chase the morning.

Yield for nothing.



Blind mag:

Let your life be your dream.

Integrity. Honesty.

It's too late for me.

Don't look back 'til you're free to

Chase the morning



Dead marni:

Yield for nothing.

Chase the morning.

Yield for nothing.

Yield for nothing.
