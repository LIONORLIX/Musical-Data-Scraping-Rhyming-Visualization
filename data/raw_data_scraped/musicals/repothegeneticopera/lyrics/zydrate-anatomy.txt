Zydrate Anatomy


Support group:

I can't feel nothing at all...



Graverobber:

Drug market, sub-market,

Sometimes i wonder why i ever got in.

Blood market, love market,

Sometimes i wonder why they need me at all.

Zydrate comes in a little glass vial.



Shilo:

A little glass vial?



Support group:

A little glass vial.



Graverobber:

And the little glass vial goes into the gun like a battery.



Support group:

Hhh-hhh...



Graverobber:

And the zydrate gun goes somewhere against your anatomy.



Support group:

Hhh-hhh...



Graverobber:

And when the gun goes off, it sparks

And you're ready for surgery!



Support group:

Surgery!



Amber:

Graverobber, graverobber,

Sometimes i wonder why i even bother.

Graverobber, graverobber,

Sometimes i wonder why i need you at all!



Graverobber:

And amber sweet is addicted to the knife.



Shilo:

Addicted to the knife?



Support group:

Addicted to the knife.



Graverobber:

And addicted to the knife,

She needs a little help with the agony.

And a little help comes in a little glass vial

In a gun pressed against her anatomy.

And when the gun goes off,

Ms. Sweet is ready for surgery.



Graverobber and support group:

Surgery!



Amber:

Graverobber, graverobber,

Sometimes i wonder why i need you at all...



Support group:

It's clean, it's clear, it's pure



Shilo:

It's what?



Support group:

It's rare.



Graverobber:

It takes you there.



Shilo:

It what?





Graverobber:

It takes you there.



Amber:

It takes you there.



Genterns:

A little jump.



Graverobber:

Before the cut!



Genterns:

Why agonize?



Genterns:

Anesthetize!

Amber:

I can't feel nothing at all!



Graverobber:

'cause surgery



Shilo:

'cause surgery?



Amber:

'cause surgery



Graverobber:

Is what she needs



Shilo:

Is what i need?



Amber:

It's what i need.





Graverobber:

To change inside.

Shilo:

To change inside?



Amber and support group:

To feel alive!



Graverobber:

Mag's contract's got some mighty fine print.



Support group:

Some mighty...fine...print...



Graverobber:

And that mighty fine print puts mag in a mighty fine predicament...

If mag up and splits, her eyes are forfeit

And if geneco and rotti so will it,

Then a repo man will come

And she'll pay for that surgery, surgery!



Graverobber and support group:

Surgery, surgery!



Amber and support group:

I can't feel nothing at all...
