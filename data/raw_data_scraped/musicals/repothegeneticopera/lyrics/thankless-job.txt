Thankless Job


Chorus:

Reeepo maaan! Reeepo maaan!



Repo man:

It's a thankless job,

But somebody's got to do it...

Peelin' off the tissue inch-by-inch,

Skinnin' off the muscles, too.

Harvesting the kidneys for the fall.

Savin' up the livers in the fridge.

No one ever thanks me when i'm done.

How self-absorbed people can be!



With a slice, or a snip,

Eenie-meenie-minie-moo...

With a cut, and a stitch,

Returning organs good as new!



It's a thankless job!

But somebody's got to do it!

Like a mop!

And a broom!

No one wants a thankless job!
