All I Owe Ioway


Marty:

I can hear 'em callin' hogs in the clear Ioway air,

I can sniff the fragrant whiff of an Ioway rose!

Chorus:

You've got Ioway in your heart!

Marty:

I've got Ioway in my hair!

I've got Ioway in my ears and eyes and nose!

Oh, I know all I owe I owe Ioway,

I owe Ioway all I owe and I know why.

I am Ioway born and bred,

And on Ioway corn I'm fed,

Not to mention her barley, wheat, and rye!

Marty and Chorus:

I owe Ioway for her ham and her beef and her lamb,

And her strawberry jam, and her pie!

Marty:

I owe Ioway more than I can ever pay,

So I think I'll move to Californ-i-ay!

Chorus:

What a shame!

Emily:

What a shame! (What a shame!)

What a shame! (What a shame!)

Chorus:

You'll be good and gosh-darn sorry when you go.

Man:

Don't I know!

Emily:

When you leave your native state,

You'll be feelin' far from great!

You'll be good and gosh-darn sorry when you go!

Marty:

I'm a seed of Ioway grain.

Emily:

You're a breeze that Ioway blew.

Marty:

I'm a drop of Ioway rain!

Emily and Chorus:

You're a drip of Ioway dew!

Emily:

Oh, I know all I owe I owe Ioway.

I owe Ioway all I owe and I know why.

I am Ioway born and bred,

And on Ioway corn I'm fed,

Not to mention her barley, wheat and rye!

I owe Ioway for her ham and her beef

And her lamb, and her --

Heppenstahl:

Strawberry jam!

Melissa:

...and her pie!

Heppenstahl:

I owe Ioway more than anyone should owe,

So I think I'll start in owin' Idaho!

Emily:

All together!

All (and Hepp. backing):

What a shame! (What a shame!)

What a shame! (What a shame!)

You'll be cryin' like a baby when you go!

Heppenstahl:

Don't I know!

When I leave my native heath,

With my lip between my teeth,

I'll be bawlin' like a booby when I go!

Emily:

You're a seed of Ioway grain,

You're a breeze that Ioway blew.

Abel (drunken):

I'm a drop of Ioway rain!

Melissa:

You're a drip of Ioway dew!



All:

Chorus:

Oh, I know all I owe I owe Ioway,

I owe Ioway all I owe and I know why.

I am Ioway born and bred,

And on Ioway corn I'm fed,

Not to mention her barley, wheat, and rye!

I owe Ioway for her ham and her beef and her lamb,

And her strawberry jam, and her pie!

Man:

I owe Ioway more than I can ever pay,

So I think I'll move to Californi-a!

Chorus:

Better stay!

Better stay!

Chorus:

You'll be good and gosh-darn sorry if you go.

Man:

Don't I know!



Then there's a little more that I don't really know.
