Boys and Girls Like You and Me


We walk on every city street

We walk in lanes where branches meet

And stars send down their blessings from the blue.

We go through storms of doubt and fear

And so we walk from year to year

Believing in each other as we do.

Bravely marching forward two by two...



Boys and girls like you and me

Walk beneath the skies

They love just as we love

With the same dream in their eyes.

Songs and kings and many things

Have their day and are gone

But boys and girls like you and me

We go on and on.



Songs and kings and many things

Have their day and are gone

But boys and girls like you and me

We go on and on.



We Will Be Together

Wayne and Emily:

We will be together,

Singing in the sun.

You'll be close to me as 'B' to 'A.'

Two contented voices,

Blended into one,

We'll go harmonizing on our way.

When we drift apart as people do,

I'll come harmonizing back to you.

Doesn't matter whether we have rain or sun!

We'll have sun if we can sing together!

We will be together,

Singing in the sun.

You'll be close to me as 'B' to 'A.'

Two contented voices,

Blended into one.

We'll go harmonizing on our way.

When we drift apart as people do,

I'll come harmonizing back to you.

Doesn't matter whether we have rain or sun!

We'll have sun if we can sing together!
