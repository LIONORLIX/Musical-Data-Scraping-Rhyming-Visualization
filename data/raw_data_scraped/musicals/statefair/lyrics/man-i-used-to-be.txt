Man I Used to Be


Vivian: you've changed bub you've changed a lot.

Jeanne: and the gang you used to go with all concur.

You've changed bub vivian: you're not yourself.



Both: if this is yourself, you're not the man you were

Pat: the man i used to be a happy man was he.

And aimless as a leaf in a gale.



J&v: whatever has become of that light hearted bum who though he had the world by the tail.



Pat: the man i used to be, his life was gay and free and aimless as a cloud in the sky.

He thought he knew the game

Then along came a dame who turned him into some other guy.

I've got ambition now i'm on a mission now.

I aim to reach the top of the tree.

That other fly by night who flew so high by night.

Has vanished like a sail on the sea.

And i'll never find that easy living easy taking easy giving fellow that i used to call me.



All: you can never find the man you used to be.



Pat: the man i used to be would go to bed at three or four a.m. J:or seven



J&v:or nine! And when his weary head wasn't near any bed a table or a chair would

Be fine!



Pat: a man without a goal a sort of friendly soul,

He liked to play the role of a host. To any thirsty pal

J&v: or a casual gal who'd stay and cook his coffee and toast.

He was a ne'er do well who wouldn't dare do well he never saw the top of a tree.

But kind of sad i am to see the cad i am dissolving like a sail on

The sea. And i'll never find that fatalistic free

And easy egotistic optimist who used to be me.

You can never find the man you used to be.
