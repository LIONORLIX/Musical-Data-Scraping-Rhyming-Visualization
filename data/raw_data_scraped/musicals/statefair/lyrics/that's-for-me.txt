That's for Me


Right between the eyes.

Quite a belt that blow I felt this morning.

Fate gave me no warning-

Great was my surprise.

I saw you standing in the sun

And you were something to see.

I know what I like, and I liked what I saw

And I said to myself "That's for me."

"A lovely morning," I remarked,

And you were quick to agree.

You wanted to walk,

And I nodded my head

As I breathlessly said "That's for me."

I left you standing under stars,

The days adventures are through.

There's nothing for me but the dream in my heart,

And the dream in my heart, that's for you.

Oh, my darling, that's for you.
