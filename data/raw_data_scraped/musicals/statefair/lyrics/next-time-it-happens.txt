Next Time It Happens


MARGY:

I leapt before I looked and I got hooked

I played with fire and burned, that's how I learned

I must admit I owe a lot to you

From now on I will know what not to do

The next time it happens

I'll know what not to do



The next time it happens

I'll be wise enough to know

Not to trust my eyesight

When my eyes begin to glow



The next time I'm in love

With anyone like you

My heart will sing no love song

Till I know the words are true



The next time it happens

What a foolish thing to say

Who expects a miracle

To happen every day?



It isn't in the cards

As far as I can see

That a thing so

Beautiful and wonderful

Could happen more than once to me



The next time I'm in love

With anyone like you

My heart will sing no love song

Till I know the words are true



The next time it happens

What a foolish thing to say!

Who expects a miracle

To happen every day?



It isn't in the cards

As far as I can see

That a thing so

Beautiful and wonderful

Could happen more than once

Could happen more than once

Could happen more than once to me
