Isn't It Kinda Fun?


WAYNE:

Maybe you'll never be the love of my life,

Maybe I'm not the boy of your dreams.

But isn't it kind of fun to look in each other's eyes

Swapping romantic gleams?

Maybe you're not a girl to have and to hold,

Maybe I'm not a boy who would stay.

But isn't it kind of fun carousing around the town

Dancing the night away?

Isn't it kind of fun holding hands

According to a sweet and corny custom?

Isnt' it kind of fun making vows?

Admitting that we both intend to bust 'em!

Maybe we're out for laughs, a girl and a boy.

Kidding across a table for two.

But haven't ya got a hunch that this is the real McCoy

And all the things we tell each other are true!



EMILY:

I'm not a girl for sentimental hype,

I never go for the Romeo type.



WAYNE:

Over a dewy-eyed Juliet

No one has seen me drool yet.



EMILY:

I never say in love's eternal tie

May our hearts never be severe.



WAYNE:

But using words less diginified,

Isn't it kind of fun to be together?



EMILY:

Maybe you'll never be the love of my life,

Maybe I'm not the girl of your dreams.



WAYNE:

But isn't it kind of fun to look in each other's eyes

Swapping romantic gleams?



EMILY:

Maybe I'm not a girl to have and to hold,



WAYNE:

Well, maybe I'm not a boy who would stay.



EMILY:

But isn't it kind of fun carousing around the town

Dancing the night away?



WAYNE:

Isn't it kind of fun holding hands

According to a sweet and corny custom?



EMILY:

Isnt' it kind of fun making vows?



BOTH:

Admitting that we both intend to bust 'em!



WANE:

Maybe we're out for laughs, a girl and a boy.

Kidding across a table for two.



EMILY:

But haven't ya got a hunch



WAYNE:

That this is the real McCoy



BOTH:

And all the things we tell each other are true!
