So Far


We have nothing to remember,

So far, so far.

So far we haven't walked by night

And shared the light of a star.

So far,

Your heart has never fluttered so near,

So near that my own heart alone could hear it.

We haven't gone beyond the very begining.

We've just begun to know

How lucky we are.

So we have nothing to remember

So far, so far.



But now I'm face to face with you

And now at last we've met,

And we can look forward to the things

We'll never forget!
