To Be Alone With You


I'd sail the skies,

Off to the farthest little star, I'd go;

Sail the skies and watch the people disappear below.

I would gladly give up ev'ry earthly thing I know,

To be alone with you,

To be alone with you.



I'd roam the earth and ev'ry corner of the Seven Seas;

I would let the raging oceans take me where they please,

To be alone with you.

To hold your hand in mine,

With nobody there beside us;

To hold your hand in mine,

There's nothing I wouldn't do.

But if someday,

To have to share you with the world I must,

If someday I find each plan of mine has turned to dust;

Then while you're here,

All that I want in all this world

Is just to be alone with you.
