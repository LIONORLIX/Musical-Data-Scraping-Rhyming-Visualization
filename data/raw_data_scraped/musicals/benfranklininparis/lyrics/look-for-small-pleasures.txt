Look For Small Pleasures


Look for small pleasures

That happen ev'ryday;

And not for fortune or fame.

Infinite treasures lie all a long the way.

As do candles waiting for flame.

How simple the joys at our finger tips,

This plain air we share is champagne one sips.

Look for small pleasures upon this ball of clay

And not for lightning to tame

And one day there's someone.

Just a friendly someone.

Who'll be husband or wife to you,

Be the love all your life to you;

And you'll finf how great

Small pleasures can prove.
