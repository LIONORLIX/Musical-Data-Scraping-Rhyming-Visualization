Ambition (Tradition)


TEVYE (spoken):

An actor in New York. Sounds crazy, no? But here in our little village of Manhattan,

there are over 50,000 actors, all trying their best not to end up in Baltimore. It isn't easy.

You may ask, "Why do we stay here if it's so competitive?" We stay because everyone else

is here. And what keeps us from ending up in Baltimore? That I can tell you in one word!!



(sung)



Ambition!

Ambition, ambition!

Ambition!



TEVYE & WOMAN:

Ambition, ambition!

(Drrrr ruh duh duh)

Ambition!



TEVYE (spoken):

Here in Manhattan we have our ambitions for everything. Opera, ballet, television, even

waiting on tables. For instance, we always wear these cute little bow ties, and carry these

side towels. This shows our constant devotion to... money!



MAN (sung):

Ahhhhhhh!

I need so much money

For my rent, my phone and service

So I work all night

And never have the chance, hey!

To go and earn money

For my rent my phone and service

So I never have the time to sing and dance, hey!



TEVYE (spoken):

You may ask, "How did these ambitions get started?" I'll tell you. I don't know. But this

much I do remember.



(sung)

When I was ten

I saw a show on TV

Saw a show on TV starring Gary Moore

I wrote and I asked him to put me on his show

But he said go ask Dinah Shore



Rejection, rejection!

Ambition!



TEVYE & WOMAN:

Rejection, rejection!

Ambition!



GOLDE:

When I went through puberty I was depressed

To see myself when I undressed

And so to modelling I acquiesed

Depression, depression!



GOLDE & TEVYE:

Ambition!

Depression, depression!

Ambition!



MOTEL:

At ten I was a pretty boy

At seventeen, a dream

I never had a pimple

So I do... commercials

Complexion, complexion



MOTEL, GOLDE & TEVYE:

Ambition!

Complexion, complexion!

Ambition!



TZEITEL:

And when I was a child

Nobody looked my way

Until I got the lead

In my high school senior play

Attention, attention!



TZEITEL, MOTEL, GOLDE & TEVYE:

Ambition!

Attention, attention!

Ambition!



(All characters repeat their verses simutaneously)



TZEITEL, MOTEL, GOLDE & TEVYE:

Rejection, depression, complexion, attention!

Ambition!



TEVYE (spoken):

Ambition. Ambition. Without our ambitions,

our lives would be as crazy as... as an actor in     New York!



TZEITEL, MOTEL, GOLDE & TEVYE:

Follow every rainbow

Til you find your dreams!
