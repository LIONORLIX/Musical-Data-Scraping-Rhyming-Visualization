Hey, Bob Fosse


The minute we walk on the stage

You can tell we have a style of distinction

A good director

Bob Fosse, you're our guy



Say wouldn't you like to know what's going on in my thigh

Your dances get right to the point

And although they've got that razzle-dazzle look



Hey Bob Fosse

Spend a little time on the book



(Each singer keeps repeating the last word of the line)



Don't you want a good plot?

Don't you care about laughs?

You forgot them in



Plot

Laughs

Big deal!



Plot

Laughs

Big deal!



Plot, laughs, big deal



(Spoken) Yeah, the lights are cool, but how about turning them on so we can see the -- Plot

All those sexy bods, but we're ready for some -- Laughs

Why don't you use an original score that has something to do with the -- Story



You got something against Italians, son?



Instead of Sweet Charity, let's revive -- Damn Yankees!



(Sung) And forget about -- big deal



The minute we walk on the stage

You start changing lights

And raising smokescreens

And spinning scenery

So clever, so refined

But everything's so wild you'll leave the actor behind!



The story gets way off the point

And you have to do a rewrite, hook, or crook!

Hey Bob Fosse!

Hey Bob Fosse!

Hey Bob Fosse!



Spend a little time on the book!



Plot, laughs, story

Plot, laughs, story

Plot, laughs, story



How's about it Bobby?

Yeah
