I Ham What I Ham


And now... presenting the Tony Award-winning star of La Cage Au Falles, Mr. George Hearn!



GEORGE: I ham what I ham

And when I ham, I get ovations

Though I make a guy dressing in drag

Vent my frustrations

It's my chance to dress myself

In pearls and Herman

My chance to become the world's next Ethel Merman

In pants I am a lamb

But in a dress --

Hey world, I ham what I ham!



I ham what I ham

And when I ham

I am a phony

Who cares if I swish

It's worth a dish to win a Tony!

It's MY PART!

So I'll rant and rave like Mussolini

So what if I play it like a queenie sweetie?

This wig is a sham

Likewise, I am

That's why I ham what I ham!
