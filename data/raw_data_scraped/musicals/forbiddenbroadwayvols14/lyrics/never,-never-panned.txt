Never, Never Panned


My name is Mary Martin

And as Peter Pan I'm grand

Some critics hesitate

But always think I'm great

I'm never never panned



To be a critic's darling

Sing impeccably, but bland

Just keep an open throat

And then scoop on every note

You're never never panned

You'll win a Tony if you're coy-like

More precious far than gold

And if you dress up boy-like

Your auto-bio's pre-sold



So come with me where critics rave

And meanies understand

You too can be a star

Like my son who plays J.R. on Ellis

We're never never panned!
