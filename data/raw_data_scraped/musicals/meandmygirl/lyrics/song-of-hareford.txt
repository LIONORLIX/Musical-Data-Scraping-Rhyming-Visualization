Since William the Norman wore the crown.

The story of Hareford through the ages

Tells of honour and glory on all its pages.



Noblesse oblige (Noblesse oblige)

Noblesse oblige (Noblesse oblige)

Men of Hareford, the ages tell,

Knew their duty and did it well.

Cherished the proud Hareford story,

Lived and died still adding to its glory.

Thanks to men of Hareford blood.

Let it go on that way, I pray that it may,

To the men of Hareford of today.
