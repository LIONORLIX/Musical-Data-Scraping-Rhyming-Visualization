Once You Lose Your Heart


Once you lose your heart,

Once somebody takes it,

From the place it rested in before.

Once you lose your heart,

Once somebody wakes it,

Then it isn't your heart anymore.

It's gone before you knew

It could ever go that way,

And now you must pursue it forever and a da-ay.



Once you lose your heart,

Once somebody takes it,

There's one thing certain from the start,

You'll find forever,

You've got to follow your heart.



It's gone before you knew

It could ever go that way,

And now you must pursue it forever and a da-ay.



Once you lose your heart,

Once somebody takes it,

There's one thing certain from the start,

You'll find forever,

You've got to follow your heart.



They say a girl should never be without love,

And all the joy that love alone can bring.

All that I have ever learnt about love,

Tells me it's a very funny thing.

For when your heart is fancy free,

You hope some men will choose it,

But on the spin you find you're in,

The very moment that you lose it.

There's one thing certain from the start

You've got to follow,

You've got to follow your heart.
