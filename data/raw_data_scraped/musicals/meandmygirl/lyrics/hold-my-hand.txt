Hold My Hand


You require a lot of looking after.

That's one job in which I take a pride.

You can always make me smile, make my journey seem worthwhile.

Why not keep me always at your side to guide you?



Hold my hand

No matter what the weather,

Just you hold my hand,

We'll walk through life together,

For you'll find in me that kind of a friend

Who will see me through to the end.



So if you'll hold my hand

We both shall walk more steadily.

For understand, you hold my heart already in that dreamland:

Where I have planned that I shall hold your hand forever.
