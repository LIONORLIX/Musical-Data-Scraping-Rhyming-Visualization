The Family Solicitor


As the Family Solicitor

Here's my advice to you,

As the Family Solicitor

Here's what you ought to do,

For six and eight

I'll put you straight

If anything goes wrong

For I contend you must pretend

That life is one sweet song.



So, sing a little and dance a little,

Be gay a little and play a little,

Bring your troubles more and more

To the Family Solicitor.

Say a little and think a little

And eat a little and drink a little,

Keep a drop of the 'ninety-four'

For the Family Solicitor!



He'll take all your cases,

Keep you in your places,

Maybe save your faces,

Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!



Hop a little and skip a little

And jump a little, let rip a little.

Thank your lucky stars once more

For the Family, the Family,

The Family Solicitor.



He'll take all our cases,

Keep us in our places.

Maybe save our faces!

Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!
