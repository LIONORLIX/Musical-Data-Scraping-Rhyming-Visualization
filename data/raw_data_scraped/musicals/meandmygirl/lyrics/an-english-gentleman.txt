An English Gentleman


William of Hareford is diametrically in reality

By all of us it's understood, he'll never make the noble rake

theoretically quite opposed

That constitutes a gentleman, an English gentleman.

And that pathetic'ly, to all that appertains

That constitutes a gentleman, an English gentleman.

to gentle folk.



So we face, with grave dubiety, this sad lack



of pure propriety.

He's no sense of High Society, the fellow even

calls himself a bloke!



He takes his food with a horrid zest, he eats

one half and he wares the rest!

Though it may be true that his blood is blue:

It is nothing like as purple as his language!



He's rough!

He's crude!

He's tough!

He's rude!

By all of us it's understood, he'll never make the noble rake

That constitutes a gentleman, an English gentleman!



We served him peas and they all shot forth to the east and west,

To the south and north!

Then he let one fly and it struck the eye of

Lady Margaret Leicester!

Poor Lady M. What a fearful bore, she's never had a pea in

her eye before!



He's rough!

He's crude!

He's tough!

(Bill - spoken) : More bleedin' chutney!

He's rude!

By all of us it's understood, he'll never make the noble rake

That constitutes a gentleman, an English gentleman.

That constitutes a gentleman, an English gentleman.
