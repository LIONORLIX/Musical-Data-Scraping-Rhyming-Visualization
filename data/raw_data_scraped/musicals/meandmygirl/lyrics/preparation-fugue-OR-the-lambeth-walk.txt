Preparation Fugue / The Lambeth Walk


Lambeth you've never seen,

The skies ain't blue, the grass ain't green.

It hasn't got the Mayfair touch,

But that don't matter very much.

We play the Lambeth way,

Not like you but a bit more gay

And when we have a bit of fun

Oh, Boy.



Anytime you're Lambeth way

Any evening, any day,

You'll find us all doin' the Lambeth walk.



Ev'ry little Lambeth gal

With her little Lambeth pal,

You'll find 'em all doin' the Lambeth walk.



Ev'rything's free and easy,

Do as you darn well pleasey,

Why don't you make your way there,

Go there, stay there,



Once you get down Lambeth way,

Ev'ry evening, ev'ry day,

You'll find yourself doin' the Lambeth walk.



Anytime you're Lambeth way

Any evening, any day,

You'll find us all doin' the Lambeth walk.



Ev'ry little Lambeth gal

With her little Lambeth pal,

You'll find 'em all doin' the Lambeth walk.



Ev'rything's free and easy,

Do as you darn well pleasey,

Why don't you make your way there,

Go there, stay there,



Once you get down Lambeth way,

Ev'ry evening, ev'ry day,

You'll find yourself doin' the Lambeth walk.



Anytime you're Lambeth way

Any evening, any day,

You'll find us all doin' the Lambeth walk.



Ev'ry little Lambeth gal

With her little Lambeth pal,

You'll find 'em all doin' the Lambeth walk.



Ev'rything's free and easy,

Do as you darn well pleasey,

Why don't you make your way there,

Go there, stay there,



Once you get down Lambeth way,

Ev'ry evening, ev'ry day,

You'll find yourself

Doin' the Lambeth-

Doin' the Lambeth-

Doin' the Lambeth walk!
