Leaning On A Lamppost


Leaning on a lamp,

Maybe you think I look a tramp,

Or you may think I'm hanging 'round to steal a car.

But no, I'm not a crook,

And if you think that's what I look,

I'll tell you why I'm here

And what my motives are.



I'm leaning on a lamppost at the corner of the street,

In case a certain little lady comes by

Oh me, oh my,

I hope the little lady comes by.

I don't know if she'll get away,

She doesn't always get away,

But anyway I know that she'll try.

Oh me, oh my,

I hope the little lady comes by.



There's no other girl I could wait for,

But this one I'd break any date for,

She'd never leave me flat,

She's not a girl like that,

She's absolutely wonderful

And marvelous and beautiful,

And anyone can understand why

I'm leaning on a lamppost at the corner of the street,

In case a certain little lady comes by.
