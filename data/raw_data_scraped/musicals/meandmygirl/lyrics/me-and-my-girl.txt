Me And My Girl


Life's an empty thing.

Life can be so awful lonesome

If you're always on your own some

Life's an empty thing.

Life's a diff'rent thing

When you've found the one and only,

Then you feel no longer lonely,

Life's a happy thing.



Ev'rything was topsy turvy,

Life seemed all wrong,

But it came all right

As soon as she came along.



Me and my girl,

Meant for each other,

Sent for each other,

And liking it so.

Me and my girl,

'Sno use pretending,

We knew the ending a long time ago.



Some little chruch with a big steeple,

Just a few people that both of us know

And we'll have love, laughter,

Be happy ever after,

Me and my girl.



Me and my girl,

Meant for each other,

Sent for each other,

And liking it so.

Me and my girl,

'Sno use pretending,

We knew the ending a long time ago.



Some little chruch with a big steeple,

Just a few people that both of us know

And we'll have love, laughter,

Be happy ever after,

Me-

and my girl.
