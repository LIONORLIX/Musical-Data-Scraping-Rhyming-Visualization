It's in His Kiss


Oh, oh, oh, hug him!

Squeeze him tight!

Find out what you wanna know!

If it's love, if it really is,

It's there in his kiss!



(How 'bout the way he acts?)

Oh no! That's not the way!

You're not listenin' to all I'm sayin'!

If you wanna know

If he loves you so

It's in his kiss!

(That's where it is!)

Oh, ooh, oh! Its in his kiss!

(That's where it is!)



Oh, oh, oh, hug him!

Squeeze him tight!

Find out what you wanna know!

If it's love, if it really is,

It's there in his kiss!



(How 'bout the way he acts?)

Oh no! That's not the way!

You're not listenin' to all I'm sayin'!

If you wanna know

If he loves you so

It's in his kiss!

(That's where it is!)

Oh, ooh, oh! Its in his kiss!

(That's where it is!)

Oh, yeah! Its in his kiss!

(It's in his hiss, that's where it is!)

ooh! It's in his kiss!

(It's in his kiss, that's where it is!)

(It's in his kiss, that's where it is!)

(It's in his kiss, that's where it is!)

(It's in his kiss, that's where it is!)

(It's in his kiss, that's where it is!)
