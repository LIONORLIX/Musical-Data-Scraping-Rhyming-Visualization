That's When the Tears Start


I hold my head high

each time you walk by

give you a great big smile

although I want to die



But when you're not in view

My whole heart breaks in two

that's when the tears start

and I start crying (over you)

that's when the tears start

and I start crying (over you)

that's when the tears start

inside I'm dying



When friends are near me

I start pretending

Tell him I'm doing fine

My heart is mending



But when they're not around

my whole world tumbles down and

that's when the tears start

and I start crying (over you)

that's when the tears start

and I start crying (over you)

that's when the tears start

inside I'm dying



Don't think about you

So much in daylight

'cause work is on my mind

And I make it all right



But when the shadows fall

Memories come to call

that's when the tears start

and I start crying (over you)

that's when the tears start

and I start crying (over you)
