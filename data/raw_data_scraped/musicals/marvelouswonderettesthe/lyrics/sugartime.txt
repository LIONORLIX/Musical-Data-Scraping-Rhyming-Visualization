Sugartime


Sugar in the morning

Sugar in the evening

Sugar at suppertime

Be my little sugar

And love me all the time



Honey in the morning

Honey in the evening

Honey at suppertime

So by my little honey

And love me all the time



Put your arms around me

And swear by stars above

You'll be mine forever

In a heaven of love



Sugar in the morning

Sugar in the evening

Sugar at suppertime

Be my little sugar

And love me all the time



Now Sugartime

Is anytime

That you're near

'Cause you're so dear

So don't you roam

Just be my honeycomb

And live in a heaven of love.



Sugar in the morning

Sugar in the evening

Sugar at suppertime

Be my little sugar

And love me all the time



Be my little sugar

And love me (love me)

all (all), all the time



(Sugartime, sugartime) Sugartime!
