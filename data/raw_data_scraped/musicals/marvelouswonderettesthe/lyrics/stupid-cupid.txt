Stupid Cupid

You're a real mean guy

I'd like to clip your wings

So you can't fly

I am in love and it's a crying shame

And I know that you're the one to blame



Hey hey

Set me free

Stupid Cupid

Stop picking on me



I can't do my homework

And I can't think straight

I meet him every morning

At 'bout half-past eight

I'm acting like a lovesick fool

You've even got me carrying his books to school



Hey hey

Set me free

Stupid Cupid

Stop picking on me



You mixed me up for good

Right from the very start

Hey, go play Robin Hood

With somebody else's heart



You got me jumping like a crazy clown

And I don't feature what your puttin' down

Well since I kissed his loving lips of wine

The thing that bothers me is

That I like it fine



Hey hey

Set me free

Stupid Cupid

Stop picking on me



You got me jumping like a crazy clown

And I don't feature what your puttin' down

Well since I kissed his loving lips of wine

The thing that bothers me is

That I like it fine



Hey hey

Set me free

Stupid Cupid

Stop picking on me



Hey hey

Set me free

Stupid Cupid

Stop picking on me



Stupid Cupid (x 8)
