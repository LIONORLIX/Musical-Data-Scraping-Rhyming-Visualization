Teacher's Pet


(Pum, pa dum pa dum)

(Pum pa dum pa dum)

(Pa dum pa dum)

(Pum pa dum pa dum)



Teacher's pet (pa dum pa dum pa dum)

I wanna be teacher's pet (pa dum pa dum)

I wanna be huddled and cuddled as close to you as I can get

(That's the lesson we're guessin' you're best in)



Mm, teacher's pride (pa dum pa dum)

I wanna be teacher's pride (pa dum pa dum)

I wanna be dated, paraded, the one most likely at your side

(Ya got a burnin' yearnin' to learn)



I wanna learn all your lips can teach me

One kiss will do at the start (are you really?)

I'm sure with a little homework

I'll graduate to your heart (to your heart)



Teacher's pet (pa dum pa dum), I wanna be teacher's pet (pa dum pa dum)

I wanna take home a diploma and show Ma that ya love me, too

(That ya love me, too)

So I can be teacher's pet long after school is through



(Oh, teacher's pet) Mm, mm

(You wanna be teacher's pet) Ah. ah

(You wanna be huddled and cuddled as close to him as you can get)



I wanna learn all your lips can teach me

One kiss will do at the start

I'm sure with a little homework

I'll graduate to your heart



Teacher's pet (you love the teacher), I wanna be teacher's pet (pa dum pa dum)

I wanna take home a diploma and show Ma that ya love me, too (Wow!)

So I can be teacher's pet (yeah!) long after school is through

(Teacher, teacher she loves you)
