Heat Wave


Whenever I'm with you

Something inside starts burning

and my heart's filled with fire



Stop this - it's got a hold on me

I said this ain't the way it's supposed to be



It's like a heatwave burning in my heart

I can't keep from crying

Tearing me apart



Whenever he calls my name

Sounds so soft sweet and plain

Right then, right there

I feel this burning pain

This high blood pressure's got a hold on me

I said this ain't the way love's supposed to be



It's like a heatwave burning in my heart

I can't keep from crying

Tearing me apart



Whenever I'm with you

Something inside starts burning

And my hearts filled with fire



Something's got me amazed

Don't know what to do

My head's in a haze



It's like a heatwave burning in my heart

I can't keep from crying

Tearing me apart
