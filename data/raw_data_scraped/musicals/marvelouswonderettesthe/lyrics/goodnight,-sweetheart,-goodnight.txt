Goodnight, Sweetheart, Goodnight


Goodnight, sweetheart, well it's time to go,

Goodnight, sweetheart, well it's time to go,

I hate to leave you, but I really must say,

Goodnight, sweetheart, goodnight.



Goodnight, sweetheart, well it's time to go,

Goodnight, sweetheart, well it's time to go,

I hate to leave you, but I really must say,

Goodnight, sweetheart, goodnight.



Well, it's three o'clock in the morning,

Baby, I just can't treat you right,

Well, I hate to leave you, babe,

Don't mean maybe, because I love you so.



Goodnight, sweetheart, well it's time to go,

I hate to leave you, but I really must say,

Goodnight, sweetheart, goodnight.



Goodnight, sweetheart, well it's time to go,

Goodnight, sweetheart, well it's time to go,

I hate to leave you, but I really must say,

Goodnight, sweetheart, goodnight.



Now, my mother and my father,

Might hear if I stay here too long,

One kiss and we'll part,

And I'll be going,

You know I hate to see you go.
