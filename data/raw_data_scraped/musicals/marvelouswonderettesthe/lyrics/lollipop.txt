Come-a, baby lollipop

Tell you why



Cindy Lou:

His kiss is sweeter than apple pie



All four:

And when he does a shaking, rocking dance

Man, I haven?t got a chance

All four:

Sweeter than candy on a stick

Huckleberry, cherry, or lime

If you had a choice, he?d be your pick



Cindy Lou:

But lollipop is mine



All Four:

Lollipop, lollipop

Oh, lolli, lolli, lolli

Lollipop, lollipop

Oh, lolli, lolli, lolli

Lollipop, lollipop

Oh, lolli, lolli, lolli

Lollipop
