Maybe


Maybe, if I pray every night

You'll come back to me

And maybe, if I cry everyday

You'll come back to-ooo stay

Ooh, ooh, maybe



Maybe, if I held your hand

You will understand

And maybe, if I'd kiss your lips

I'd be at your command

Ooh, ooh, maybe



I prayed and prayed

(You are my true dream)

To the Lord

To send you back, my love

But instead you came to me

(You are my true dream)

Only in my-i-i-i dreams



Maybe, if I pray every night

You'll come back to me

And maybe, if I cry everyday

You'll come back to-ooo stay

Ooh, ooh, maybe

(Maybe, maybe, maybe)



Maybe

(Maybe, maybe, maybe)



Maybe

(Maybe, maybe, maybe)



FADES-



Maybe

(Maybe, maybe, maybe)



Maybe

(Maybe, maybe, maybe)
