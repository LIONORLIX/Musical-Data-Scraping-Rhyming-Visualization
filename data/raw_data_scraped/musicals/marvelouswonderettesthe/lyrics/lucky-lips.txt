Lucky Lips


When i was just a little girl with long silky curls

Mama told me, "honey, you've got more that other girls.

Now, you may not be good looking but you'll soon wear diamond clips

And you'll never have to worry 'cause you've got lucky lips."



Lucky lips are always kissing,

Lucky lips are never blue.

Lucky lips will always find

A pair of lips that will be true.

I don't need a four-leaf clover,

Rabbit's foot or good luck charm.

With lucky lips i'll always have

A fellow in my arms.



I never get heartbroken, no, i'll never get the blues

And if i play that game of love i know i just can't lose.

When they spin that wheel of fortune all i do is kiss my chips

And i know i picked a winner 'cause i've got lucky lips.



Lucky lips are always kissing,

Lucky lips are never blue.

Lucky lips will always find

A pair of lips that will be true.

I don't need a four-leaf clover,

Rabbit's foot or good luck charm.

With lucky lips i'll always have

A fellow in my arms.
