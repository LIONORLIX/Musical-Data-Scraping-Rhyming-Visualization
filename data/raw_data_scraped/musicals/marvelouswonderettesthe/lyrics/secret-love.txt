Secret Love


Once I had a secret love

That lived within the heart of me

All too soon my secret love

Became impatient to be free



So I told the friendly star

The way that dreamers often do

Just how wonderful you are

And why I'm so in love with you



Now I should it from the highest hills

Even told the golden daffodils

At last my heart's an open door

And my secret love's no secret anymore



(Repeat)
