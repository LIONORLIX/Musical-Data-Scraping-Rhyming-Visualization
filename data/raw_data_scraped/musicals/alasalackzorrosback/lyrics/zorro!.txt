Zorro!


Zorro:

Never fear,

I am here!

To fight for the right of the oppressed!

I am Zorro!

Zorro!

All evil I detest!

Liberator!

Avenger!

Defender of justice with my sword!

When you see

The letter "Z"

You'll know that law and order's been restored.

(spoken) Deliverance is at hand!



Buck:

(spoken)The deed! He took the deed!



Conchita:

(spoken)Chihuahua!



All:

Never fear,

He is here!

To fight for the right of the oppressed!

He is Zorro! (Zorro!)

Zorro! (Zorro!)

Of all heroes he's the best!

Of all heroes he's the best!
