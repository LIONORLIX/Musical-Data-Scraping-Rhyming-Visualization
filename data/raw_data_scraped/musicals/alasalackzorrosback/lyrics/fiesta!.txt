Fiesta!


Chorus:

We're from a fiest in there.

Buck planned it with infinite care.

The balloons are all free

But, unfortunately

There will be a small fee for the air!

Fiesta! Fiesta!

We're having such miserable fun!

Fiesta! Fiesta!

We can't wait until it is done!

If you go you had best take a tip

Don't eat very much of the dip!

It is spicy and hot

And if you want some water

Buck charges ten pesos a sip!

Fiesta! Fiesta!

The last hour felt just like a day!

Fiesta! Fiesta! How we wish we could all go away!
