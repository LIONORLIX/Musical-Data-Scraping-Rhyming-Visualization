The 20th Century Fox Mambo


Karen:



At Paramount it's "Oh la la"

The Warner Bros. "Cha cha cha"

And L.B. Mayer loves his schmaltz

So M.G.M. made the great waltz



But the 20th Century Foxtrot

It's precious - but precious, it's not hot

To make the big boys hire me

Please make that rhythm fiery



Come on boys and girls - make me over



In this factory where dreams can true

Are you ready to make someone new

You're the team that must teach me to do

The 20th Century Fox Mambo



Done the homework and I'll pass the test

I'll do whatever my teachers suggest

I can do it clothed or undressed

The 20th Century Fox Mambo



Make it up, shake it up

Let the fantasies begin

Here's the dope

To get cast, change the past

Make the light just right for Cin-emascope



Take a gamble cuz it's safe to bet

Mr. Zanick ain't seen nothin' yet

When we're finished he'll never forget

This 20th Century Fox



(For fame - play the game - change your name -to the 20th Century Fox)



Make it up - shake it up

Make me feel like the main attraction

Change the clothes, fix the nose

And then 5,6,7,8

Action! (Action!)



Now I'm blonde but I ain't so dumb (No)

Hollywood will be under my thumb (Yes)

I'll change partners until I become



The 20th Century Fox

Mambo!
