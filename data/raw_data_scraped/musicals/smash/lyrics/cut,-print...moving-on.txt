Cut, Print...Moving On


I know I made you mad

But this time that we've spent creating

Was the best time I ever had



Now I love to sit with mem'ries

But they won't come until we're gone



So give me a kiss

And cut, print...moving on



Tell me a brand new story

Together, we'll turn the page

The grass is always greener

On some new technicolor stage



And if a duckling never swims

She'll never become a swan

Yes, I'm diving in

So cut, print...moving on



Yes, there have been nights I'll long to relive

But sometimes you gotta roam

You can't fight when something's gotta give

But you'll always be my home away from home



Now, I like to play a love scene

But don't let it last too long

Play me the eight bar intro

Of some new lush romantic song



I'm not afraid to take that leap

With you to depend upon

Now, tell me your name?

Cut, print...moving on



We told the same jokes

We breathed the same air

We couldn't tell night from day

But just like the end of a love affair

We all know the time comes to break away



Last year, we all were strangers

This year, we're lifelong friends

I know that this location

Is not where our story ends



Get up cause the rat race never ends

This life is a marathon

And I plan to run so much more than a sprint

What's next? Well, I can't even give you a hint



But boys, that's a wrap

So, cut! Print!

Moving on!

And on!

Moving on!
