Never Give All the Heart


As a girl, I lived in a million homes

So I always would keep to myself

And my lessons were learned

From the stories and poems

I would steal from a library shelf



Yes, the books like the Roots

Weren't mine to keep

But the words weren't left behind

And I think of them all and I can't sleep

And a poet who read my mind



As the wise men once wrote

Never give all the heart

Well, it's easy to see

He was writing for me

I just wish I could play that part



Yes, he scribbled that love isn't worth thinking of

That is fades out from kiss to kiss

If I just learned those lines

Well, just think of the misery I'd miss



As the Irish men said

Don't put your heart up to play

When he warned of the cost

And the heart that he lost

Mister Yeats really paved the way



For the men that I've known

Who have clearly shown

They've reading him from the start

'Cause when it comes to me

Well, their kisses come free

But they never give all the heart



When he warned of the cost

And the heart that he lost

Mister Yeats really paved the way



For the men that I've known

Well, they've clearly shown

They been reading him from the start

'Cause each time that I fall

They never give all the heart



MmmmmmMmmm....
