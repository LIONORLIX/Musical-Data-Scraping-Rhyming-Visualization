Somewhere Over The Rainbow


When all the clouds darken up the skyway

There's a rainbow highway to be found

Leading from your window pane

To a place behind the sun

Just a step beyond the rain



Somewhere over the rainbow

Way up high

There's a land that I heard of

Once in a lullaby



Someday I'll wish upon a star

And wake up where the clouds are far behind me

Where troubles melt lemon drops

Away above the chimney tops

That's where you'll find me



Somewhere over the rainbow

Bluebirds fly

Birds fly over the rainbow

Why then oh why can't I



If happy little bluebirds fly

Beyond the rainbow

Why, oh, why can't I
