Rumour Has It


All of these words whispered in my ear,

Tell a story that I cannot bear to hear,

Just 'cause I said it, it don't mean that I meant it,

People say crazy things,

Just 'cause I said it, don't mean that I meant it,

Just 'cause you heard it,



Hey



Rumour has it (Karen: Rumors has it)

Rumour has it

Rumour has it (Karen: Ooooooooooooohheey)

Rumour has it (Karen: Oooooooooooooohheey)

Rumour has it (Karen: Oooooh)

Rumour has it (Karen: Ooooohey)

Rumour has it (Karen: Heeeeyhe)

Rumour has it (Karen: Oooooh)

Rumour has it (Karen: Oooooooooooooohheey)

Rumour has it (Karen: Came on)

Rumour has it (Karen: Heeeeyhe)



But rumour has it he's the one I'm leaving you for.
