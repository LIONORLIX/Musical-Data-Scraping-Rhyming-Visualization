Let's Be Bad


[CHORUS GIRLS]

When we're feeling down and low,

Then our favorite word is no

Cause it points the way to go.

[The rest of the Chorus girls come on]

Let's be bad.

Who knows what will come tomorrow?

Neighbor, lose the sauce and sorrow.

Here's some sugar you can borrow.

Let's be bad.



[CHORUS GIRLS]

Don't want to be boring

Our twenties are roaring

Let's punish the flooring

Yeah drummer man, do what you can

Tonight the (whoo!) will hit the fan!



[sung]

If you need some more enticing,

Here's a girl with twice the spicing

We're the cake, but she's the icing!

Let's be bad.

Let's be bad.



[sung]

[CHORUS GIRLS:]

Let's be bad!

Let's be bad!



[MARILYN]

If you say something is taboo,

Well, that's the thing I want to do.

Do it till we're black and blue,

Let's be bad.



Guns and gangsters suit me fine.

Al Capone is a buddy of mine.

He's my big-shot valentine.

Let's be bad.



If spirits are sagging

If feet are 'a dragging

Fall off of that wagon.

The piano hums to the bass and drums,

And I'll be dancing when Hoover comes.



Don't care if you've tied the knot,

Most folks want what they ain't got.

Melt the ice, some like it hot.

Let's be bad.



Here's my whistle, make it "whetter."

Let me wear that scarlet letter.

When I'm bad I'm even better.

Let's be bad.



[sung]

[MARILYN]

Say "bye-bye, propriety!"

No polite society

Give me notoriety!

Let's be bad.



[sung]

Bring on the vices!

Don't care what the price is!

I'll add the right spices,

When the stand-up bass slaps you in the face,

Well, it ain't my husband I'll embrace.



I can't see the use in waiting.

Your lips are intoxicating

Do my hips need some translating?

Let's be bad.



If I drown in bathtub gin,

Notify my next of kin,

They might grieve, or might jump in!

Let's be bad.



Who wants plays and O'Neill dramas?

Gershwin is the cat's pajamas!

I'm the queen of the red-hot mamas!

Let's be bad.



Each crook and G-man

Each cop and he-man

Just stick with me, man!

Every joint's a juke with my red-hot uke,

And just like Judas once said to Luke,



Here's the key for my ignition,

Hit the gas to my transmission!

When you hear the things I'm wishing'

You won't offer opposition!

Let's prohibit Prohibition!

Let's be bad!



Some like it hot, and that ain't bad!
