Second Hand White Baby Grand


My mother bought it secondhand from a silent movie star

It was out of tune but still I learned to play

And with each note we both would smile forgetting who we are

And all the pain would simply fly away



Something secondhand and broken still can make a pretty sound

Even if it doesn't have a place to live

Oh, the words were left unspoken when my Mama came around

But that Secondhand White Baby Grand still had something beautiful to give



Through missing keys and broken strings the music was our own

Until the day we said our last goodbyes

The baby grand was sent away

A child all alone, to pray somebody else would realize

That something secondhand and broken still can make a pretty sound

Even if it doesn't have a place to live

Oh, the words are still unspoken now that Mama's not around

But that Secondhand White Baby Grand still has something beautiful to give



For many years the music had to roam



Until we found a way to find a home

So now I wake up every day and see her standing there

Just waiting for a partner to compose



And I wish my mother still could hear that sound beyond compare

I'll play her song till everybody knows

That something secondhand and broken still can make a pretty sound

Don't we all deserve a family room to live

Oh, the words can't stay unspoken until everyone has found



That Secondhand White Baby Grand that still has something beautiful to give

I still have something beautiful to give
