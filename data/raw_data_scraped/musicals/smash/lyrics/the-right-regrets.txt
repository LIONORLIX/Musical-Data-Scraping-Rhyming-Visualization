The Right Regrets


A writer has the empty page

Where he can set the scene

He puts the actors on the stage

Or on the movie screen



The characters all say the words

The writer wants to hear

And then, my friend

A happy end



But when the writer steps outside

That room where he is king

He can't control when lives collide

Or what the lovers sing



And so he hides behind his words

The one place he belongs

And in black and white

He can rewrite the wrongs



Where he can find the strength to say

What those he loves should hear

And just erase mistakes she's made

Then make them disappear



Where he can change the plot

So he's a hero, not a louse

And when the curtain falls

There's not a dry eye in the house



A writer hopes to leave behind

A work no one forgets

And when he writes, "the end"

To find he has the right regrets



A writer has the empty page

Where he can use his pen

To mend his heart

And try to start

Again
