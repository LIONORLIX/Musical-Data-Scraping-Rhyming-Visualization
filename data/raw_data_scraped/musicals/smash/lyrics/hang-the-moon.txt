Hang the Moon


If our lives were a movie

I'd know what to do

I'd write every scene with my heart

An R.K.O. Picture that stars me and you

And this time I'd learn my part



I'd paint you some scenery

We'd sing, and we'd dance

From morning to late afternoon

And when that scene is done

Then I'd take down the sun

And for you darling, I'll hang the moon



We'd wake up to sunshine

Like lights on a set

You'd reach out and there'd be my hand

All day there'd be music, a perfect duet

That flows from the white baby grand



At night when you're frightened

I'll play you to sleep

That melody from Clair de Lune.

And to fill up the sky,

Past the clouds I would fly,

And for you darling, I'll hang the moon.



Hang the moon forever

So you'd never fear the darkness

The darkness I've known

Moon, protect Norma Jean

So that she'll never be alone

Never alone



If our lives were a movie

Then you'd be the star

'Cause now I know the role I should play

To applaud all you do

All the things that you are

And just be there on opening day



I know in the past

That the lines were all wrong

And the music was never in tune

But the wish that I make Is for just one more take

Because then darling I'll hang the moon



I'll hang the moon above you

So that you'll never fear the darkness

The darkness of night

Then you'll know I love you

Each time that you feel the light

Feel the light



If our lives were a movie

Then I'd cut away

All the moments when I wasn't there

The scenes that are happy

Are all that will stay

The rest will dissolve into air



As the final reel ends

We might both shed a tear

For the ending is coming up soon

But when the screen fades to black

We can smile and look back

And for you darling I'll hang the moon
