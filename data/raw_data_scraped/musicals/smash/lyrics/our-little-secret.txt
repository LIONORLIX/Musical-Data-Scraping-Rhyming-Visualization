Our Little Secret


[John F. Kennedy:]

Nobody asking me questions

Nobody planning a coup

Nobody with their suggestions of what not to do



Nobody taking our picture

Nobody turning the screw

It's our little secret, just us two



Outside of this room there's a cold war

But you'll never know it in here

There's just no defense, the heats too intense

And oh, how it rises whenever you're near



Yes, every president has one

A pleasure that's strictly taboo

It's our little secret, just us two



[Marilyn:]

Come here, baby



[John F. Kennedy:]

No FBI getting nervous ([Marilyn:] Mmmmm...)

No CIA peeking through ([Marilyn:] Peeking through)

I have my own Secret Service to take care of you ([Marilyn:] To take care of me, yeah, me...)

No one from Time or from News Week...



[Both:]

To document our rendezvous

It's our little secret, just us two



[John F. Kennedy:]

In politics you must be careful



[Both:]

You bedfellow may be a shot



[John F. Kennedy:]

From the left, from the right

Baby, turn off the light



[Both:]

It's easy to do what you must in the dark



[John F. Kennedy:]

So let's do it now for our country ([Marilyn:] Oh, for our country)

And raise the old red, white and...



[Both:]

...blue

It's our little secret, just us two

Just us two

Just us two



[John F. Kennedy:]

Shhhh!
