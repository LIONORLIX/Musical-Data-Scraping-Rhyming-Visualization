Let Me Be Your Star


KAREN:

Fade in on a girl

With a hunger for fame

And a face and a name you'll remember.

The past fades away

Because as of this day

Norma Jean's gone,

She's moving on.



Her smile and your fantasies

Play a duet

That will make you forget

Where you are.

The music starts playing

It's the beat of her heart saying,

"Let me be your star."



IVY:

Flash back to a girl

With a song in her heart

As she's waiting to start the adventure.

The fire and drive

That make dreams come alive,

They fill her soul.

She's in control.



The drama, the laughter,

The tears just like pearls.

Well, they're all in this girl's repertoire.

It's all for the taking,

And it's magic we'll be making.

Let me be your star.



BOTH:

I'll just have to forget the hurt that came before,

Forget what used to be.

The past is on the cutting room floor,

The future is here with me.

Choose me!



Fade up on a star

With it all in her sights:

All the love and the lights

That surround her.

Someday she?ll think twice

Of the dues and the price



IVY:

She?ll have to pay



KAREN:

She?ll have to pay



IVY:

But not today



KAREN:

But not today



BOTH:

Then she?ll do all she can

For the love of one man

And for millions who look from afar.

And what you?ve been needing

Is all here and my heart?s bleeding.

Let me be your star!
