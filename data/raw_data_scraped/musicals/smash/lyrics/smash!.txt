Smash!


You ask me, how far will I go

You ask me what I wouldn't do

For the sight of my name

As it fills every frame

Yes, I want to be more than a flash

I ask you, what lies should I tell

I tell you I'm willing to learn

So enroll me in school

In your kidney-shaped pool

In a two-piece I make Quite a splash

'Cause I wanna be a smash

Yes, I wanna be a hit and run

Till I've won every heart

Be a queen to each king Or mechanic

Plus you, Mr. Zanuck

But first, mister

You have to give me the part

I know all the tricks of the trade

I've even invented a few

Now your interest is mounting

And soon we'll be counting

The lights and the nights

And the cash

'Cause I'm gonna be a Smash!

Yes, I'm gonna be a smash

Won't you help me be a...

Smash!
