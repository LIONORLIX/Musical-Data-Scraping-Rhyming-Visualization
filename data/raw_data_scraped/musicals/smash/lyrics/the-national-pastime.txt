Marilyn:

Fellas



Team:

Marilyn:

Fellas



Team:

Is it?



Marilyn:

Hey team!



Team:

Hold the benches it?s Marilyn!



Marilyn:

I just got a date



Team:

She just got a date



Marilyn:

With Baseball?s Chilton Chate



Team:

The lucky so and so



Marilyn:

So run me through the bases

Put me through my paces

And teach me all the things a slugger?s lover to know

What?s that there?



Team:

That?s the pitchers mound



Marilyn:

Have you ever seen a shape that is so perfectly round?



Team:

Batter up,

Play ball

You better give it your all, cuz? all men like to play at



Marilyn:

The national pastime

Who?s that there?



Team:

That?s the first base coach



Marilyn:

Have you noticed that he signals every time I approach?



Team:

kill me out



Marilyn:

Throw him out



Team:

Because there isn?t a doubt that



All:

All men like to play at



Marilyn:

The national pastime

When I was just a little girl

I liked being dainty and pearly

But now that I?ve given sports a whirl,

I finally kind of like to get dirty



Team:

Baby what?s that there?



Marilyn:

That?s the team bull pen

Kind of like the odds I?m seeing, no girls I?m there



Team:

Hit the deck look alive before the ladies run dry



Marilyn:

Because my skills and my passion will elevate the national?



Peanuts!

Hot dogs!

Cracker Jack!

I don?t care I don?t care if I ever get back!



Team:

When the seasons over,

The play won?t end



Marilyn:

Cuz? a baseball diamond is a girl?s best friend



Team:

Yes her style and her fashion will elevate the national pastime
