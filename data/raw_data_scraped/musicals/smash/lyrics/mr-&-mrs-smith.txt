Mr & Mrs Smith


Ivy:

Call the Justice of the Peace,

But don't tell him our names,

Don't put out a press release,

Or mention baseball games.



Michael:

Book the nearest Bridal suite,

One room will suit us fine,

For the desk clerk that we meet,

The only autograph we'll sign is,



Both:

Mr and Mrs smith,

Simply the folks next door,



Michael:

People without a single clue what

an Agent or Grip is for



Ivy:

Yes,



Both

Nothing can beat the view,

When as far as the eye can see, there's



Michael:

No one but Mrs,



Ivy

No one but Mr,



Both

Smith and Me.



Michael:

For a home the man provides,

A cottage built for two,

We'll check the small town classifieds,

Variety won't do.



Ivy:

Then we'll move to mainstream USA, &nbsp

And sign the deed of trust,

The mailbox at our hideaway,

Will tell the whole wide world that we're just,



Both:

Mr and Mrs smith,

Merely the folks next door,



Michael:

People who use their kitchen each night,



Ivy:

And never been into chores,



Michael:

Yeah,



Both

Nothing can beat the view,

For as far as the eye can see, there's



Michael:

No one but Mrs, &nbsp



Ivy: &nbsp

No one but Mr,

&nbsp

Both: &nbsp

Smith and Me. &nbsp



Both:

No early calls,

No big premieres,

No less romantic theme,

We'll spend the nights,

Making our own,

Little league baseball team,



Both:

We're no one you've ever seen,



Ivy:

Movie stars don't live anywhere here,

Except on the local drive-in screen,



Both:

Yes,

I'd gladly disappear,

If it might guarantee a view of,



Michael:

No one but Mr,



Ivy:

No one but Mrs,



Both:

Smith and You.
