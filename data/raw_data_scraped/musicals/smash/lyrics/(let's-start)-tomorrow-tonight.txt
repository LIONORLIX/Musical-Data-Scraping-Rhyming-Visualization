(Let's Start) Tomorrow Tonight


Round and round goes the wheel of love

Some say like Russian roulette

There's a jackpot I'm dreaming of

I'm ready to place my bet



No need to beg, steal or borrow

The future is looking bright

Yes, I'm laying odds on tomorrow

So let's start tomorrow tonight



Can't cha feel, baby, we're in the chips

Tomorrow's our lucky day

I can feel gold at our fingertips

We'll prosper if we parlay



No time for sadness and sorrow

Together, we'll fight that fight

Yes, I'm laying odds on tomorrow

So let's start tomorrow tonight



Don't need no clover or lucky charm

That rabbit can keep his foot

As long as we're walkin' arm in arm

It's aces, I feel

So shut up and deal!



I know that we're on a winning streak

The future can't come too soon

Let's climb together to reach that peak

Then baby, we'll shoot the moon



I'm high as Kilimanjaro

And with you, Jack, I'm ready for flight

Yes, I'm laying odds on tomorrow

So let's start tomorrow tonight



As long as we're walkin' arm in arm

It's aces, I feel!

So shut up and deal!

Oh, I know that we're on a winning streak

The future can't come too soon



Let's climb together to reach that peak

Then baby, we'll shoot the moon

I'm high as Kilimanjaro

And with you, Jack, I'm ready for flight



Yes, I'm laying odds on tomorrow

So let's start tomorrow tonight

Let's start tomorrow tonight
