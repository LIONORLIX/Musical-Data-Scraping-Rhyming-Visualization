Let Me Be Your Star (Reprise)


Karen:

Fade in on a girl

With a hunger for fame,

And a face and a name to remember.

The past fades away

Because as of this day,

Norma Jean's gone.

She's moving on...



Ivy:

Her smile and your fantasies play a duet

That will make you forget where you are.

The music starts playing,

It's the beat of her heart saying:



Karen:

Let me be your star.
