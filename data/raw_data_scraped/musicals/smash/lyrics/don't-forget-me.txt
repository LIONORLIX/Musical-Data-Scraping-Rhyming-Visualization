Don't Forget Me


They thought they could dispose of me

They tried to make me small

I suffered each indignity

But now rise above it all



Yes, the price I paid was all I had

But at last, I found release

And if something good can come from bad

The past can rest in peace



Oh if you see someone's hurt

And in need of a hand

Don't forget me

Or hear a melody crying from some baby grand

You don't forget me



When you sing happy birthday to someone you love

Or see diamonds you wish were all free

Please say that you won't;

I pray that you don't forget me



But forget every man who I ever met

'Cause they only lived to control

For a kiss they paid a thousand

Yet they paid fifty cents for my soul

They took their piece

The price of fame that no one can repay

Ah, but they didn't buy me when they bought my name

And that is why I pray



That when you see someone's hurt

And in need of a hand

You don't forget me

Or hear a melody crying from some baby grand

You don't forget me



When you sing happy birthday to someone you love

Or see diamonds you wish were all free

Please say that you won't;

I pray that you don't forget me



There are some in this world who have strength on their own

Never broken or in need of repair

But there are some born to shine who can't do it alone

So protect them and take special care

Take care



And don't forget me

Please take care

And don't forget me

When you look to the heavens with someone you love

And a light shining bright from afar

Hope you see my face there

And then offer a prayer

And please let me be

Let me be that star
