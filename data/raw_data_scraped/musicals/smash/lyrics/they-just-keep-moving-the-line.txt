They Just Keep Moving the Line


The field was bright with clover

I saw the finish sign

I started as a rover

And then victory was mine

I thought the race was over

But they just keep moving the line



They cheered at my persistence

But prayed for my decline

The path of least resistance

Led to Hollywood and Vine

I tried to go the distance

But they just keep moving the line



I jumped all of the hurdles

To break out of the pack

I started on the outside

And then hit the inside track



I left the other fillies

Back at the starting gate

Was ready, on my mark, I got to set

To hurry up and wait



So talent and ambition

Won me a chance to shine

I aced the big audition

But it's rainin' on Cloud Nine

Can't beat the competition

'Cause they just keep moving the line



I handled every corner

Each bump along the track

And when I saw the ribbon, well

There was no turning back



I won the photo finish

I posed for all the men

But before I got my trophy

Well, the race began again



So I made friends with rejection

I've straightened up my spine!

I'll change each imperfection

Till it's time to drink the wine!

I'd toast to resurrection

But they just keep moving the line!



Please give me some direction,

'Cause they just keep moving the line!
