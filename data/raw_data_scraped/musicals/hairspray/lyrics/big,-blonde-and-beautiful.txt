Big, Blonde And Beautiful


MOTORMOUTH

Once upon a time

Girl i was just like you

Never let my extra large

Largesse shine through



Hair was brown and nappy

Never had no fun

I hid under a bushel

Which is easier said than done!



Then one day my grandma

Who was big and stout

She said you gotta love yourself

From inside out



And just as soon as i learned

How to strut my funky stuff

I found out that the world at large

Cant get enough so...



Bring on that pecan pie

Pour some sugar on it

Sugar don't be shy



Scoop me up a mess

Of that chocolate swirl

Don't be stingy,

I'm a growing girl



1 offer big love

With no apology

How can i deny the world

The most of me



I am not afraid

To throw my weight around

Pound by pound by pound

Because i'm

Big, blonde and beautiful

There is nothin' 'bout me

That's unsuitable



No one wants a meal

That only offers the least

When girl we're servin' up

The whole damn feast



Slice off a piece

Of that hog head cheese

Then take a look inside

My book of recipes



Now, don't you sniff around

For something fluffy and light

I need a man who brings

A man-size... Appetite



I'll use a pinch of sugar

And a dash of spice

I'll let ya lick the spoon

Because it tastes so nice



I'll keep it in my oven

'Til it's good and hot

Keep on stirring til it hits the spot

Because i'm...



Big, blonde and beautiful

And Edna girl, you're lookin' so

Recruitable

Why sit in the bleachers

Timid and afraid

When Edna,

You can be your own parade!



TRACY

So? How 'bout it, Mama?



EDNA

Well, I am big, I am blonde... ish, and if you say

I'm beautiful, I guess I'm beautiful. OK, I'll do it!



ALL

Yeaaa!

Look out old Baltimore

We're marching in

'And we ain't shufflin'

Through that old back door



EDNA

And Tracy, i will join the fight

If i can keep up this pace



WILBUR

And girls, i'll be right at your side

If i can find some space



MOTORMOUTH

So you can

Hold your head up

Just as big as ya please

You know they'll hear me knockin'

With the two of these!



MOTORMOUTH & ENSEMBLE

Tomorrow, side by side

We'll show the world what's right



EDNA

Looks like i'm touchin' up my roots tonight!



MOTORMOUTH & ENSEMBLE

Then we'll be

Big, blonde and beautiful

It's time to face the fact

It's irrefutable



Can't ya hear that rumbling?

That's our hunger to be free

It's time to fin'ly taste

Equality



COUNCIL MOTHERS & DAUGHTERS

On mother/daughter day

Where thin is in,

We're white as wool



MOTORMOUTH

Well ladies, big is back!

And as for black, it's...

And get us on TV!



PROTESTERS

COUNCIL MEMBERS

Stay away! This isn't Negro Day!



(Police sirens wail. Whistles blow.

As the protesters continue their march, they are loaded into the addy wagon.)



MOTORMOUTH
