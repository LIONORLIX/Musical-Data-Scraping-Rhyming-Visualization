TRACY

Once upon a time when i was just a kid

You never let me do iust what the older kids did

But lose that laundry list of what you won't allow



GIRLS

'Cause mama, i'm a big girl now



AMBER

Once upon a time i used to play with toys

But now i'd rather play around with teenage boys

So, if i get a hickey, please don't have a cow



GIRLS

'Cause mama, i'm a big girl now



PENNY

Ma, i gotta tell you that without a doubt

I get my best dancing lessons from you

You're the one who taught me how to "twist and shout"

Because you shout non-stop

And you're so twisted too!

Wo -oh -oh -oh -oh



TRACY

Once i used to fidget

'Cause i just sat home



AMBER

But now i'm just like gidget

And i gotta get to rome!

Stop! Don't! No! Please!

Stop! Don't! No! Please!



GIRLS

Mama, i'm a big girl now

(hey mama, say mama)



TRACY

Once upon a time i was a shy young thing

Could barely walk and talk so much as dance and sing

But let me hit that stage, i wanna take my bow



GIRLS

'Cause mama, i'm a big girl now



AMBER

Wo - oh - oh - oh - oh

Once upon a time i used to dress up 'ken'

But now that i'm a woman, i like bigger men

And i don't need a barbie doll to show me how



GIRLS

'Cause mama, i'm a big girl now



GIRLS

Ma, you always taught me

What was right from wrong

And now i iust wanna give it a try

Mama, i've been in the nest for far too long

So please give a push and mama watch me fly



AMBER

Watch me fly



GIRLS

Hey, mama, say mama



PENNY

Someday i will meet a man

You won't condemn



AMBER

And we will have some kids

And you can torture them



TRACY

But let me be a star

Before i take that vow



GIRLS

'Cause mama, i'm a big girl now



PENNY

Oh - Oh - Oh



GIRLS

Mama, i'm a big girl now



AMBER

Hey - Hey - Hey
