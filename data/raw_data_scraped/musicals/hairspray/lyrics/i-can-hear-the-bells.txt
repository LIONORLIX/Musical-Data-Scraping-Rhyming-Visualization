I Can Hear The Bells


TRACY

I can hear the bells



PENNY

Tracy, are you all right?



TRACY

Well, don'tcha hear them chime?



PENNY

I don't hear anything.



TRACY

Can't 'cha feel my heartbeat keeping perfect time?

And all because he...



Touched me

He looked at me and stared, yes he

Bumped me

My heart was unprepared when he

Tapped me

And knocked me off my feet

One little touch

Now my life's complete 'cause when he



Nudged me

Love put me in a fix, yes it

Hit me

Just like a ton of bricks, yes my

Heart burst

Now i know what life's about

One little touch

And love's knocked me out and,



TRACY (& ENSEMBLE)

I can hear the bells

My head is spinning

I can hear the bells

Something's beginning



Everybody says

That a girl who looks like me

Can't win his love

Well, just wait and see 'cause



I can hear the bells

Just hear them chiming

I can hear the bells

My temp'rature's climbing



I cant contain my joy

'Cause i fin'ly found the boy

I've been missin'

Listen!

I can hear the bells



Round one

He'll ask me on a date and then

Round two

I'll primp, but won't late because

Round three's

When we kiss inside his car

Won't go all the way

But i'll go pretty far!

And then,



Round four

He'll ask me for my hand and then

Round five

We'll book the wedding band so by

Round six

Amber, much to your surprise

This heavyweight champion

Takes the prize and...



I can hear the bells

My ears are ringing

I can hear the bells

The bridesmaids are singing



Everybody says

Thet a guy who's such a gem

Won't look my way

Well, the laugh's on them 'cause

I can hear the bells



My father will smile

I can hear the bells

As he walks me down the aisle



My mother starts to cry

But i can't see 'cause Link and i

Are french kissin'

Listen!

I can hear the bells



I can hear the bells

My head is reeling

I can hear the bells

I can't stop the pealing



Everybody warns

That he won't like what he'll see

But i know that he'll look

Inside of me yeah,



I can hear the bells

Today's just the start 'cause

I can hear the bells

And 'til death do us part



And even when we die

We'll look down from up above

Remembering the night

That we two fell in love



We both will share a tear

And he'll whisper as we're reminiscin'

Listen!

I can hear the bells



ENSEMBLE

She can hear the bells



TRACY

I can hear the bells



ENSEMBLE

She can hear the bells



TRACY

I can hear the bells



ENSEMBLE

Bum, bum, bum, bum!
