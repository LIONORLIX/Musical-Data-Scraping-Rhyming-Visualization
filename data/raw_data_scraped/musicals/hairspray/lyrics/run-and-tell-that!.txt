Run And Tell That!


SEAWEED

Hey Tracy, my mom is hosting a platter party up on North Avenue. Wanna "check it out"?



PENNY

May i also "check it out?



SEAWEED

Oh, you surely may!



TRACY

I've never been to North Avenue!



LINK

Ya think it'll be all right for, you know... us?



SEAWEED

It's cool, cracker boy!



PENNY

Being invited places by colored people!



TRACY

It feels so hip!



SEAWEED

I'm glad you feel that way, friends, 'cause not everybody does.



I can't see

Why people look at me

And only see the color of my face



And then there's those

That try to help, god knows

But have to always put me in my place



Now i won't ask you to be color blind

'Cause if you pick the fruit

Then girl, you're sure to find...



The blacker the berry

The sweeter the juice

I could say it ain't so

But darlin', what's the use?



The darker the chocolate

The richer the taste

And that's where it's at...

...now run and tell that!!



ENSEMBLE

Run and tell that!



SEAWEED

Run and tell that!



ENSEMBLE

Run and tell that!



SEAWEED (& ENSEMBLE)

I can't see

Why people disagree

Each time i tell them what i know is true



And if you come

And see the world i'm from

1 bet your heart is gonna feel it too



Yeah. I could lie

But baby. Let's be bold

Vanillajian be nice

But if the truth be told...



The blacker the berry

The sweeter the juice

I could say it ain't so

But darlin', what's the use



The darker the chocolate

The richer the taste

That's where it's at



Now run and tell that!!



ENSEMBLE

Run and tell that!



(The scene shifts to Motormouth Maybelle's record shop dance party where her daughter Li'l Inez and her friends are already in full swing.)



LI'L INEZ

Hey, you're Tracy Turnblad! You're my favorite dancer on the Corny Collins Show.



SEAWEED

This is my sister, Li'l Inez.



TRACY

Sure. I saw you at the auditions.



LI'L INEZ

Well, you're the only one who

did, 'cause they kicked me out

on my young, gifted and black

behind.



SEAWEED

Tell 'em about it!



LI'L INEZ

I'm tired of coverin' up all my pride



SEAWEED & ENSEMBLE

So give me five on the black-hand side



LI'L INEZ

I've got a new way of movin'

And i got my own voice



SEAWEED & ENSEMBLE

So how can i help

But to shout and rejoice



LI'L INEZ

The people 'round here

Can barely pay their rent

They're "try'n to make dollar

Out 'a fifteen cent"

But we got a spirit

Money just cant buy



LI'L INEZ & ENSEMBLE

It's deep as a river

And soars to the sky!!



SEAWEED & ENSEMBLE

I cant see

The reason it cant be

The kinda world where we all get our chance



The time is now

And we can show them how

To turn the music up and let's all dance



'Cause all things are equal

When it comes to love

Well, that ain't quite true

'Cause when push comes to shove...



The blacker the berry

The sweeter the juice

I could say it ain't so



But darlin', what's the use

The darker the chocolate

The richer the taste

That's where it's at



SEAWEED

...Now run and tell that!!



ENSEMBLE

Run and tell that!



SEAWEED

Run and tell that!!
