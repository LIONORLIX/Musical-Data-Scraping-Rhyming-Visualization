The Nicest Kids In Town


CORNY

Hey there, Teenage Baltimore!

Don't change that channel!

'Cause it's time for the Corny

Collins Show! Brought to you by

Ultra Clutch Hairspray!



CORNY (& COUNCIL MEMBERS)

Ev'ry afternoon

When the clock strikes four

(bop-bee-ba, ba-ba-ba-ba, bee-ba)



A crazy bunch of kids

Crash through that door

(bop-bee-ba, ba-ba-ba-ba, bee-ba)



They throw off their coats

And leave the squares behind

And then they shake it, shake it, shake it

Like they're losing their mind

You'll never see them frown

'Cause they're the nicest kids in town



Every afternoon

You turn your T.V. on

(na, na, na, na, na, na-na-na-na)



And we know you turn the sound up

When your parents are gone, yeah

(na, na, na, na, na, na-na-na-na)



And then you twist and shout

For your favorite star

And once you've practiced every step

That's in your repertoire

You better come on down

And meet the nicest kids in town



Nice white kids

Who like to lead the way

And once a month

We have our "negro day!"

And i'm the man who keeps it spinnin' round

Mr. Corny Collins

With the latest, greatest Baltimore sound!!



So every afternoon

Drop everything

(bop-bee-ba, ba-ba-ba-ba, bee-ba)



Who needs to read and write

When you can dance and sing?

(bop-bee-ba, ba-ba-ba-ba, bee-ba)



Forget about your algebra

And calculus

You can always do your homework

On the morning bus

Can't tell a verb from a noun

They're the nicest kids in town



Roll Call!!



COUNCIL MEMBERS

I'm Amber!

Brenda!

Sketch!

Shelley!

Lou Ann!

And I'm...LINK!

(All of the girls scream.)



CORNY (& COUNCIL MEMBERS)

So, if every night you're shaking

As you lie in bed

(mony-mony, ooh, mony-mony)



And the bass and drums

Are pounding in your head

(mony-mony, ooh, mony-mony)

Who cares about sleep

When you can snooze in

School?



They'll never get to college

But they sure look cool

Don't need a cap and a gown

'Cause they're the nicest

Kids in town



They're the nicest. Nicest

They're the nicest, nicest

They're the sugar 'n' spicest,

The nicest kids in...

Kids in town!
