What gives a girl

Power and punch?

Is it charm, is it poise?

No, it's hairspray!



What gets a gal

Asked out to lunch

Is it brains, is it dough?

No, it's hairspray!



If you take a ride

With no can at your side

Then your flip will be gone

With the wind



But if you spray it and lock it,

You can take off in a rocket

And in outer space

Each hair will be in place



Why take a chance

When you get up and dance

If you twist, i insist

You use hairspray



And tell your mother

Her head she should smother

With "ultra-clutch" faithfully



So if you're a redhead,

A blonde or brunette

Just take my advice

And you might just get

The only thing better than hairspray



CORNY

That's me!



ENSEMBLE

Ska-doo-dle-e-ya

Doo-dle-e-ya do wah



CORNY

Forget the milkman

The only thing better than hairspray



ENSEMBLE

Hairspray! Wow!



CORNY

That's me!



CORNY & ENSEMBLE

What makes a man

Reach out and touch?

Ultra clutch!



CORNY & ENSEMBLE

So if you're a redhead,

A blonde or brunette

Just take my advice

And you might just get



CORNY

The only thing better than hairspray

That's me!
