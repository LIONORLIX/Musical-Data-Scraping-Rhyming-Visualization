(You're) Timeless To Me


WILBUR

Styles keep a changin'

The world's re-arrangin'

But Edna, you're timeless to me

Hemlines are shorter

A beer costs a quarter

But time cannot take what comes free



You're like a stinky old cheese, babe

Just gettin' riper with age

You're like a fatal disease, babe

But there's no cure

So let this fever rage



Some folks can't stand it

Say time is a bandit

But i take the opposite view

Cause when i need a lift

Time brings a gift

Another day with you

A twist or a waltz

It's all the same schmaltz

With just a change in the scenery

You'll never be old hat

That's that!

You're timeless to me



EDNA

Oh, Wilbur!



Fads keep a-fadin'

Castro's invading!

But wilbur, you're timeless to me

Hairdos are higher

Mine feels like barbed wire

But you say i'm chic as can be!



You're like a rare vintage ripple

A vintage they'll never forget

So pour me a teeny weenie triple

And we can toast the fact we ain't dead yet!

I can't stop eating

Your hairline's receding

Soon there'll be nothing at all

So, you'll wear a wig

While i roast a pig

Hey! Pass that geritol



Glenn miller had class

That chubby checker's a gas

But they all pass eventually

You'll never be passe

Hip hooray!

You're timeless to me



(They dance.)



EDNA

You're like a broken down chevy

All you need is a fresh coat of paint



WILBUR

And Edna, you got me goin' hot and heavy

You're fat and old, but baby, boring you ain't!



WILBUR & EDNA

Some folks don't get it

But we never fret it

'Cause we know that time is our friend

It's plain to see

That you're stuck with me

Until the bitter end



And we got a kid

Who's blowin' the lid

Off the turnblad family tree



EDNA

You'll always hit the spot

Big shot!

You're timeless to me



WILBUR

You'll always be du jour

Mon amour

You're timeless to me



EDNA

You'll always be first string



WILBUR

Ring-a-ding-ding!



WILBUR & EDNA

You're timeless to me



EDNA

You're timeless to me



WILBUR

You're timeless to me



WILBUR & EDNA

You're timeless to me!!
