It Takes Two


LINK

They say it's a man's world

Well, that cannot be denied

But what good's a man's world

Without a woman by his side

And so i will wait

Until that moment you decide



That i'm your man

And you're my girl

That i'm the sea

And you're the pearl

It takes two, baby,

It takes two





A king ain't a king

Without the pow'r behind the throne

A prince is a pauper. Babe,

Without a chick to call his own

So please, darling, choose me

I don't wanna rule alone

Tell me,



I'm your king

And you're my queen

That no one else

Can come between

It takes two, baby,

It takes two



GUYS

Don't you know

Lancelot had guinevere

Mrs. Claus has old st. Nick

Romeo had Juliet

And liz, well, she has her dick



They say it takes two to tango

Well, that tango's child's play

So take me to the dance floor

And we'll twist the night away



Just like frankie avalon

Had his favorite mouseketeer

I dream of a lover, babe,

To say the things 1 long to hear

So come closer baby,

Oh and whisper in my ear



Tell me you're my girl

And i'm your boy

That you're my pride

And i'm your joy

That i'm the sand

And you're the tide

and I'll be the groom

If you'll be my bride

It takes two, baby,

It takes two



It takes two, baby

It takes two...
