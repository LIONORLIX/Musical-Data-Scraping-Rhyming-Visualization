Thou, Proteus, Thou Has Metamorphosed Me


(music. she writes proteus a letter)



thou proteus, thou hast metamorphosed me



made me neglect my farming, lose my mind

war with good suitors kept my temper short



julia (cont’d)

made sleep a stranger weak, heartsick with thought

your loving juuuuulliiaaaaaaa



(chorus hums under dialogue)



being your slave, what should i do but tend

upon the hours and times of your desire’

i have no precious time at all to spend

nor services to do, till you require.



(proteus & launce enter left)



so true a fool is love that in your will

though you do anything, he thinks no ill



(julia gives proteus the letter

then crosses right)



i love you.

(julia exits)



proteus

then roses bloom.



sweet love! sweet lines! sweet life!

here is her hand, the agent of her heart;

here is her oath for love, her honor’s pawn

oh, that our fathers would applaud our loves

to steal our happiness with their consents;

oh, heavenly julia.



(proteus kisses the letter then

kisses launce on the forehead as

proteus’s father antonio enters

carrying luggage)



launce

(to the audience)

spring comes to verona.



antonio

how now! what letter are you reading there’



proteus

may’t please your lordship, ‘tis a word or two

of commendation sent from valentine,

delivered by a friend that came from him.

(proteus has been holding the

letter behind his back. launce

takes it and exits quickly)



antonio

i am resolved that thou shalt spend some time

with valentine in the court of milan.

(antonio has put the luggage

down right center stage)



proteus antonio

no! yes

no yes

no huh

no huh

no what

no what

no boy



(proteus has crossed down right

center steps into the audience)



antonio

boy! boy! come back here boy.



(proteus returns to down center

stage by antonio)



tomorrow be in readiness to go.

excuse it not, for i am peremptory.



proteus

my lord, i cannot be so soon provided:

please you, deliberate a day or two.



antonio

look what thou wantst shall be sent after thee:

no more of stay! tomorrow thou must go.

(antonio is on the left steps.

he blows his son a prefunctory

kiss, but then sticks his right

fist in his left elbow in a ges-

ture of pure contempt. he exits)



proteus

thus have i shunned the fire for fear of burning

and drenched me in the sea, where i am drowned.

i fear to show my father julia’s letter,

lest he should take exception to my love;

and with the vantage of mine own excuse

hath he excepted most against my love.

oh, how this spring of love resembleth

the uncertain glory of an april day,

which now shows all the beauty of the sun,

and by and by a cloud takes all away!



(julia enters stage right,

she sees the luggage)



proteus (cont’d)

lovers are lovers best at parting

when your heart is breaking

you’re in love
