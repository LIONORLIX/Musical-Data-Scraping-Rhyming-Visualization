Follow The Rainbow


Valentine

You mean that really is quicksand’



Speed

Yes.



Valentine

Follow the rainbow

Then turn right at the sun

Which you see going (down) ...



Speed

Down in the valley

Then underneath the waterfall

And mountain (pass) ...



Valentine

Pass by the pine trees

The moss is always growing

On the northern (side) ...



Speed

Side saddle, we’ll straddle

Rattle snakes and fiddle

While we paddle (down) ...



Valentine

Down through the rapids

And somersault the waterfall

And whirling pool ...

(valentine & speed exit as

Proteus appears)



Proteus

Pool all of our knowledge

Keep us safe and sound

How can we ever be lost’



(launce enters left)



Launce

How can we ever be found’



(they exit as valentine & speed

Appear on third level)



Speed

We found the igloo

Now turn right at the palm tree

Which is bearing (fruit) ...



Valentine

Fruitlessly didn’t this territory

Pass before our eyes to(day) ...



Speed

Day of all days

When we needed every drop

We saved in our can(teen)



Valentine

Teenier and teenier

Is any chance

That we had to get to mi(lan)



Valentine & speed

Land’

Is that land’

No, it’s sea!

No, it’s you!

No, it’s me!

No, it’s mirage.



(valentine & speed exit.



Lucetta & julia enter)



Lucetta

Rajahs and blood thirst shieks

Cause those shrieks

Girls being forced

We are lost



All

We are lost

We are lost

We are lost

We are lost



Lucetta

Indians and wind mongol hordes

With curved swords

Take all their slaves

Up to their caves

(to julia)

This way



(lucetta & julia exit. Valentine

& speed enter)



Speed

Tea leaves once told me i’d travel

But who believes what’s in a (cup)



Valentine

Cup your hands up to your eyes



And look and tell me what you’re seeing



(the whole scene changes. It’s

Milan and it’s the most exciting

Place in the world. The ensemble

Dances.



One girl in the ensemble at the

Beginning says to valentine:)



Girl (citizen of milan)

Hey, sugar, come here i want to talk to ya.



(music)
