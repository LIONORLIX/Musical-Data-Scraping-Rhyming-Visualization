On thurio held by four male

Members of the ensemble while

Rest of ensemble is down right

As if at a revival meeting)



Duke

She said

His lets bestride the ocean; his reared arm

Crested the world. His voice was propertied

As all the tuned spheres, and that to friends

But when he meant to quail and shake the orb

He was as rattling thunder. For his bounty,

There was no winter in’t. An autumn ‘twas

That grew the more by reaping. His delights

Were dolphin like: they showed his back above

The element they liv’d in. In his livery

Walked crowns and crowntes; reals and island

Were as coins dropped from his pocket



Thurio

Oh no, she didn’t. She said:
