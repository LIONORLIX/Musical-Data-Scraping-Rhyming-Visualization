Hot Lover


Launce & speed

Young folks spend their time lovin’

Rich folks can afford lovin’

I’ve been

A dog catcher, bartender, log roller, truck driver

But not lover

I want to be a hot lover,

A hot, hot lover

Like the kids in the play



Launce

Oh i’ve had lovin’

Oh god ‘- the pain

To be rejected by a poodle

Then by a great dane ‘- oh -- oh ‘- oh



Launce & speed

Oh

Old folks take their time lovin

Poor folks can’t afford lovin’

I’ve been

Hair cutter, house painter, meat chopper, road runner

But not lover



Launce & speed (cont’d)

I want to be a hot lover

A hot, hot lover

Like the kids in the play
