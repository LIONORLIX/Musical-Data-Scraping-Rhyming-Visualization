Don't Have A Baby


Lucetta

(sings)

Don’t have the baby

Don’t have the baby

We have too many babies

It’s time to start the ban



Speed

You must have the baby

You must have the baby

But tell the baby his father

Was a terrible man



Launce

No, have the baby

But lie to the baby

Tell the baby his father

Was the emperor or milan



Julia

I’ll have the baby

I’ll have the baby

I won’t lie to the baby

I’ll just tell the baby

I loved his father

And when we made him

Oh how his father loved me



Oh proteus, let this habit make thee blush!

Be thou ashamed

It is the lesser blot, modesty finds,

Women to change their shapes than men their mind.



Proteus

Than men their minds! ‘Tis true, o heaven were man

But constant, he were perfect! That one error

Fills him with faults; makes him run through all the sins:

What is in silvia’s face but i may spy

More fresh in julia’s with a constant eye’



Julia

Sinverguenza!

A buena hora se te ocurre que



Proteus

Si



Julia

Me quieres



Proteus

Okay



Julia

Porque no pensaste antes



Proteus

Si



Julia

De meterte con la otra



Proteus

Okay.



Julia

En realidad es un problema



Proteus

Si



Julia

Proque no se si perdonarte oh no



Proteus

Si. Si. Si. Si!

(proteus and julia exit.



Duke & thurio enter right third level)



Duke

Yonder is silvia.



Thurio

Yonder is silvia, and silvia’s mine.

(thurio crosses down stairs as

Speed & launce & lucetta exit.



Valentine confronts thurio who

Is on the right platform)



Valentine

Thurio, give back, or else embrace thy death!

(valentine has drawn his sword.

Thurio realizes he’s unarmed)



Thurio

I’m unarmed.



(valentine drops his sword and

Chases thurio across the second

Level. Thurio cries)



Thurio

Sir valentine, i care not for her, i:

I hold him but a fool that will endanger

His body for a girl that loves him not.

I claim her not, and therefore she is thine.



Duke

The more degenerate and base art thou,

To make such means for her as thou hast done

And leave her on such slight conditions.



Thurio

Give me back my ducats.

(thurio cries)



Duke

Now, by the honor of my ancestry,

I do applaud thy spirit, valentine,

And think thee worthy of an empress’ Love:

Know, then, i here forget all former griefs,

Cancel all grudge, repeal thee home again,

Plead a new state in thy unrivaled merit,

To which i thus subscribe: sir valentine,

Thou art a gentleman and well derived.

Take thou thy silvia, for thou hast deserved her.



(thurio cries. Valentine comes

To silvia)



Valentine

I thank your grace; the gift hath made me happy.

(valentine picks up silvia)

Come on, baby.

(they exit left. Duke crosses

Up center. Lucetta enter right

Platform as thurio crosses down

To left platform. Thurio sees

Lucetta. It’s love at first sight)
