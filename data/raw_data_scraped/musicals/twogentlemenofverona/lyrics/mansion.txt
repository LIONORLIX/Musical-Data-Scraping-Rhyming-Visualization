Mansion


You live in the mansion

I call my heart

I keep beneath my doublet

You live there on a permanent lease!

Nothing like a sub-let



You’ve got to move in

You never can let

The property get run down

The thought of you

Moved in this morning

I want you here by sundown



You’ve rent my heart

Now you control it

If this is rent control

Then i extol it



You live in the mansion

I call my heart

I keep beaneath my doublet

You live there on a permanent lease

Nothing like a sub-let



Everybody needs a home

Here is your vacancy

You already are my love

Come live with me

Silvia, silvia



You live in the mansion

I call my heart

I keep beneath my doublet

You live there on a permanent lease

Nothing like a sub-let

Nothing like a sub-let

Nothing like a sub-let
