My precious little girl

Bring my baby home to me

And the wedding is today

Capture them before they go

O woe, o woe.

He’s cut me to the core

The enemy’s called eglamour

Just a smidgen

The enemy was last seen wearing a pidgeon

The lovers have been sighted

And they’re headed right this way

Follow me into the fray

And follow me into the fray
