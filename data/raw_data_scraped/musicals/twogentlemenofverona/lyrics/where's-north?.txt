Where's North?


(Dance)



Valentine & speed

Milan we finally got here

Where’s fame’

How do i apply’

Where’s fortune’

And how do i get it’

The noise

The size

I can’t believe my eyes



(all dance as the duke, silvia, his

Beautiful daughter, and thurio enter

Up center and cross down center. The

Ensemble falls to the floor)



Duke

The duke

I am the boss here

Silvia

This is my little girl

This is thurio

He’s gonna wed her

(to silvia)

Don’t miss the boat

Go dance me up some votes



(silvia & thurio begin to waltz

Because that’s the kind of jerk

He is. A dancer cuts in and we

Have a lively dance with silvia

And male ensemble dancers)



Ensemble

Here’s north

Forget the compass

It’s noon

I know the time

I’m here

Call me fortune’s pet

Milan

I’ll lick you yet



(silvia ends her dance. Thurio

Crosses to her, but she’s no dummy

And she snubs him.



The duke appears at the top of the

Stage. Everyone cheers him)
