Night letter

So divine

Night letter

Come be mine

Nothing better than a

Hot night letter

Night letter

Oh so cool

Night letter

Hear me drool

Nothing wetter than a

Hot night letter

Did you remember to lick the stamp

Night letter

Did you remember to slap the flap

Night letter

Did you remember you have to say

S-w-a-k

Night letter

Mail it early

Night letter

Avoid the rush

Hope you get a

Night letter



Oh, my father would enforce me to marry a vain and foolish

Suitor of fabulous great wealth to stuff the coffers

Of his government and pay for the vain and foolish

War my father uses for his own ends.

Help me...



Valentine

(silvia falls into valentine’s arms)



Silvia

Help me, valentine.

The marriage is tomorrow

I have to be saved tonight.



Could you save me

Tonight at nine



Could you save me

Tonight at nine

Valentine

I could save you

Tomorrow at nine



Silvia

That’s too late too late

To escape my fate

Tomorrow noon is my wedding day

Come save me

I want to be very far away

Come save me

When the groom comes

To look for me

I didn’t r.s.v.p.



Valentine

Yes, i could save you

Tonight at eight



Silvia

Wel, tonight at eight

Would be just great



Valentine

I’m your man now

Let me make my plan now



Silvia

It’s a high tower they keep me prisoner in.

It’s a high tower

And you’ve got to be saved

By tonight at eight
