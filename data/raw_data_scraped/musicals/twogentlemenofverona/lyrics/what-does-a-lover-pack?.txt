(ensemble exits. Proteus pulls

Out a huge string of pearls from

His shoulder bag and puts them

Around julia’s neck. She takes

Proteus’ hand and leads him down

Left, lies on the floor, fixes

The pearls and offers herself to

Him. Proteus takes off his glasses

And looks to the heavens)



Proteus

Thanks you.



(they embrace on the floor as

Music begins and launce enters up

Right to get the luggage. Launce

Sees them, does a take, then

Crosses over to them)
