Land Of Betrayal


Lucetta

We come from the land of betrayal

An indian word meaning hate

But the people smile all the time there

And the cultural advantages are great

Proteus

Follow me.



Lucetta

The air that we breathe is polluted

The wars that we fight are the same

But no one is quite sure who leads us

So no one is ever to blame



Our principal export is lying

Truth, youth and beauty we ban

Our principal pasttime is loving

The kind they stamp made in japan



I must say you do look familiar

Could it be that you’ve ever been there’

We live in the heart of the city

Where deceit double-crosses despair.



I’m happy to talk of the old town

I see now i am not away

The town changed its name to everywhere

And i live in it every day



We come from the land of betrayal

An indian word meaning hate

But the people smile all the time there

And the cultural advantages are great



Proteus

Come, you are now in the service of my lady, silvia.



(they exit right.



As proteus, julia, & lucetta exit

Stage right the duke enters from up

Center, looks around then blows his

Whistle. Thurio enters up center

Followed by three guards which he

Positions off stage to wait for

Valentine as he positions himself

On the second level stage left.

The duke has crossed down the right

Center steps into the audience and

We see valentine enter up left center

On his bike wearing a long cloak and

He rides down center)



Duke

Sir valentine.



Thurio

Ah, sir valentine.



Duke

Whither away so fast’



Valentine

Please it, your grace, there is a messenger

That stays to bear my letters to my friends,

And i am going to deliver them.



Duke

Be they of much import’



Valentine

The tenor of them doth signify

My health and happy being at your court.



Duke

Nay then, no matter; stay with me awhile.

(the duke crosses the stage to

Down left to lean against a pole

As thurio crosses to valentine)



Thurio

Ay, stay.



Duke

I am to break thee of some affairs

That touch me near, where in thou must be secret

‘Tis not unknown to thee that i have sought

To match my friend, sir thurio, to my daughter



Valentine

I know it well, my lord, and sure the match

Were rich and honorable; besides, the gentleman

Is full of virtue, bounty, worth, and such qualities

Beseeming such a wife as your fair daughter.



Thurio

You’re very perceptive



Duke

Sir valentine.

(he motions for valentine to come

Closer and thurio balances the

Bike as valentine crosses to the

Duke)



Thurio

My what a lovely bike!



Duke

There is a lady in milan here

Whom i affect; but she is nice and coy

And nothing esteems my aged eloquence.

Now, therefore would i have thee to my tutor ‘



Thurio

And i would have thee for my tutor.



Duke

For long ago i have forgot to court;

Besides, the fashion of the time is changed ‘-

How and which way i may bestow myself

To be regarded in her sun-bright eye.

But she i mean is promised by her friends

Unto a youthful gentlemen of worth

And kept severely from resort of men,

That no man hath access by day to her



Valentine

(nervously)

Why, then, i would resort to her by night.



Thurio

Ay, but the doors be locked and the keys kept safe.



Duke

That no man hath recourse to her by night.



Valentine

What lets but one my enter at her window’



Thurio

Oh, no. Her chamber is aloft.



Duke

And built so shelving that one cannot climb it

Without apparent hazard of his life.



Valentine

Why, then a ladder...



Thurio

A ladder.



Duke

A ladder.



Thurio

Oh, a ladder!!



Valentine

A ladder made quaintly with cords

With a pair of anchoring hooks to cast up

Would serve to scale another hero’s tower,

So bold leander would adventure it.



(all laugh)



Duke

Now, as thou art a gentlemen of blood.

Advise me where i may have such a ladder.



Valentine

Pray tell, when would you use it’



Thurio

This very night.



(the duke removes his sunglasses)



Duke

(a threat)

For love is like a child

That longs for everything that he can come by.



Valentine

By seven o’clock ...



Thurio

Seven o’ Clock ...



Valentine

I’ll get you such a ladder.



Duke

Hark thee: i will go to her alone.

How shall i best convey the ladder thither’



Valentine

It will be light, my lord, that you may bear it

Under a cloak.



(the duke puts on his sunglasses.

Thurio goes into a dancing frenzy)



Thurio

A cloak, a cloak, a cloak!



Valentine

That is of my length.



Duke

A cloak as long as thine will serve the turn’



Valentine

Ay, my good lord.



Duke

Then let me see thy cloak:

I’ll get me one of such another length.



Valentine

Why, any cloak will serve the turn, my lord.



Duke

How shall i fashion me to wear a cloak’

I pray thee, let me feel thy cloak upon me.



(thurio has now reached valentine

And takes the cloak from his back

Exposing the rope ladder under the

Cape. As the duke prepares to blow

The whistle to bring on the guards)



Thurio

(ad lib without accompaniment)

Night ladder so divine



(the duke blows the whistle and

The guards appear as thurio does

A dance with the cape. Valentine

Tries to escape. He is blocked at

The right)



Night ladder now you’re mine



(valentine tries to escape to the

Left. Once again the duke blows

The whistle and another guard appears

Stage right with army clothes which

Thurio takes after handing the guard

The cape)

Oh, nothing gladder than a long night ladder

(thurio hands the uniform to

Valentine)



Duke

(ad lib without accompaniment)

No need to look so quizzical

You just passed your physical



You have no future and no past

The army is your home at last



I don’t know why he looks so sad

Army life it ain’t so bad



He’s patriotic is this man

To god, to country, and milan

(duke & thurio exit up center.

Duke smiles at valentine just

Before exiting)



Valentine

And why not death rather than living torment’

To die is to be banished from myself:

And silvia is myself: banished from her

Is self from self: a deadly banishment!



Valentine (cont’d)

What light is light, if silvia be no seen’

What joy is joy, if silvia be not by’

Unless it be to think that she is by,

And feed upon the shadow of perfection.

Except i be by silvia in the night,

There is no music in the nightingale;

Unless i look on silvia in the day,

There is no day for me to look upon:

She is my essence and i leave to be

If i be not by her fair influence

Fostered, illumined, cherished, kept alive.



(proteus enters)



Proteus

Cease to lament for that thou canst not help

And study help for that which thou lamentst.

Time is the nurse and breeder of all good.

Here, if thou stay, thou canst not see thy love;

Besides, thy staying will abridge thy life.

Hope is a lover’s staff: walk hence with that

And manage it against despairing thoughts.

Thy letters may be here, though thou art hence;

Which, being writ to me, shall be delivered

Even in the dark ebony bosom of thy love.



(valentine starts to protest)



The time now serves not to expostulate:

Come, i’ll convey thee through the city gate;



(silvia runs on the top level

Of the stage)



Silvia

Valentine!



Proteus

Don’t look back. You’ll turn in to salt.

(proteus leads valentine off.



The ensemble runs on)



Duke

Now, now daughter.



Silvia

Oh, you.

First i loved eglamour, and you sent him away

Now i love valentine and you sent him away

Why do you send away everyone i love’



Duke

Go back to your tower, dear.



Silvia

I don’t want to go back to my tower.

No. No. Valentine! Valentine!



(duke carries silvia off)



Thurio

My lord, my lord



Duke

(running back on)

Yes



Thurio

She takes his going grievously.



Duke

No! No!

I just talked to her and she said you were a poet

And she mentioned how orpheus’ Lute was strung with poets’ Sinews

Whose golden touch could soften steel and stones

Make tigers tame and huge leviathans

Forsake unsounded deeps to dance on sands.



Thurio

She said all that’



Duke

All that and more.
