I Love My Father (Reprise)


Proteus (cont’d)

I love my father

I want to tell him

I love my mother

I want to tell her

I love my brother

I want to tell him

I love my sister

I want to tell her

I love my mirror

I want to tell me

I want to love me

I want to love me

You can’t love another

Without loving yourself
