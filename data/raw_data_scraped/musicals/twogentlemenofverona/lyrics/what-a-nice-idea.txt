What A Nice Idea


Julia

Because he loves her

He despises me

Because i love him

I pity him



If i could be her

Just for a moment

When he was holding her

I would insult him

Then he’d be unhappy

And not know where to run



I could turn back into me

And i would comfort him

What a nice idea

What a sweet idea

But easier said than done.



Wait!



Julia (cont’d)

If i could be him

Just for a moment

I’d hold her so close

And yell insults at her

She’d never speak to him again



I could turn back into me

And i would comfort him

It ends up the same

Either way



All i want to do

Is have someone scold him

Then i’d come on the scene

And gladly hold him

That’s my idea of fun

Chorus

Que bonita idea dit dit dit dit dit di-ah

Que idea mas linda (repeat background

Que idea mas dulce rhythm under solo)

Que idea ams rica

What a nice idea

What a sweet idea

But easier said than done

But easier said than done easier said than done.



(proteus enters from right and

Whistles on the ensemble who enter

All vocalizing and bearing presents

For silvia. Innkeeper follows proteus)



Proteus

Cut! Cut!



Innkeeper

What a terrible noise.



(proteus blows pitch-pipe then

Conducts ensemble)
