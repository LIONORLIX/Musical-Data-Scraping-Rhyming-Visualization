Dragon Fight


(A chinese dragon enters down right

With lighted eyes and fire and smoke

From its mouth. Eglamour crosses

Down center and leads the assault.

The dragon circles the tent as

Proteus & valentine defend themselves

With swords. Then the dragon turns

On eglamour and chases him off)



Proteus

Forgive me, valentine: if hearty sorrow

Be sufficient ransom for offense,

I tender ‘t here; i do as truly suffer

As e’er i did commit.



Valentine

Then i am paid;

And once again i do not receive thee honest.

Who by repentance is not satisfied

Is nor of heaven nor earth, for these are pleased.



(julia still in disguise enters)



By penitence the eternal’s wrath’s appeased:

And, that my love may appear plain and free,

All that was mine in silvia i give thee.



Proteus

O, thank you.

(proteus crosses to tent.

Julia swoons)



Julia

O me unhappy!



Valentine

Look to the boy.



(launce, lucetta, speed enter down

Left. Silvia comes out of the tent)



Proteus

(crosses to julia)

Why, boy! Why, wag! What’s the matter.

(proteus sees the ring he has

Given to julia)

Why this is the ring i gave to julia

But how camest thou by this ring’ At my depart

I gave this unto julia.



Julia

Julia herself did give it me;

And julia herself hath brought it hither



(julia pulls off her cap. Her

Hair tumbles down)



Proteus

Julia! And pregnant too.



(he sees she is pregnant. He

Feigns innocence)
