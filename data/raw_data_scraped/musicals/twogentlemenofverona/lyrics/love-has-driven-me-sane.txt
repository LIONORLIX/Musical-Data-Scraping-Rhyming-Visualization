Love Has Driven Me Sane


Silvia

I love my father

I want to tell him

I love my mother

I want to tell her

I love my brother

I want to tell him

I love my sister

I want to tell her

I love my mirror

I want to tell me

I want to love me

I want to love me

You can’t love another

Without loving yourself

(silvia exits.



Three male ensemble and launce

Enter up center playing basketball)



Love has driven me sane (finale continued)



Ensemble (3 men)

My pace was frantic

My mood was tortured

Now love has driven me sane



Launce

My life resembled

The cherry orchard



All

Now love has driven me sane



Am i healthy’ Am i happy’ Yes!

Gone is all the angst and crappiness

The big shock is the shock of happines love, love

Love love love love love love love, love, love



(the men led by proteus enter with

Yo-yos, doing elaborate tricks with

Yo-yos, with frisbies. All the girls

Appear on the top level and blow soap

Bubbles into the audience. Paper hearts

Fly down on the stage. Valentine sails

On stage on a gold baroque scooter)



All

I was into all perversions

Now love has driven me straight

Homo necro just diversions

Now love has driven me straight



Trade my straight-jacket

For a wedding veil

Throw away my needle and spoon



Sado mas

And all that jazz

Labotamized

Right out of my brain



(everybody does healthy exercises)



Life’s a prison

And love’s the pardon

Love’s the gardener

And i’m the garden

Love’s the doctor

And i give in

I was sick but

Love has driven

Me sane

Love has driven me sane



(all do tai chi)



I love my father

I want to tell him

I love my mother

I want to tell her

I love my brother

I want to tell him

I love my sister

I want to tel her

You can’t love another

Without loving yourself



(speed does karate and all

Fall down)



I lived in terror

I lived in panic

Now love has driven me calm

At least depressive’s

A break from manic

Now love has given me balm



(thurio enters and leads company

In ballet)



Launce thurio

Panic put me in paralysis fifth

Terror kept me in analysis passe

Wonderland is not where alice is attitude

Tendu

Battu

Arabesque



All

Love love love love love love love love love love love love



(lucetta enters on a pogo stick)



Lucetta

Each delusion

Made me merrier

Reality is so damn flat

Penis envy

And hysteria

I was into all that



(julia and silvia come on from

Opposite sides of the stage and

Lead everybody in a dance. Everyone

Is juggling, doing handstands,

Cartwheels, baton-twirling, swinging

From the rafters)



All

Life is passion

And fear is treason

There’s no ration

To my reason



Love’s the mansion

That i live in

Love’s the chauffeur

Who has driven me sane

Love has driven me sane

Sane

Sane

Love has driven me sane



(the chorus is standing on its

Head)



You can’t love another

Without loving yourself
