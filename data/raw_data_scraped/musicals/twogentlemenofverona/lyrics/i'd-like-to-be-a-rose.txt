I'd Like To Be A Rose


I’d like to be a rose

That hands on julia’s breast



Valentine

I’d like to be that oak tree,

That one that tow’rs above the rest



Proteus

I’d like to be a poem that she reads



Valentine

One she rips and throws away

I’d like to be the emperor

Any boy can be, they say.



Proteus

I’d rather rule her heart.



Valentine

I’d rather rule the world



Proteus

Oh! For a night with julia!



Valentine

Twenty days of wooing for one night of cooing



Proteus

Verona, imagine always living here



Valentine

Milan, imagine always living there!



Proteus

Verona, imagine never leaving this place



Valentine

Milan, if everyone knew my face.



Proteus

Verona, julia’s name on every breeze



Valentine

Milan, known by all the maitre d’s



There’s a million wonderful people in the world.

I want to know them all,

I want them all to bow down,

Here’s valentine,

Now up, now down.



Proteus

There is only one person in my world,

I want to know her



Valentine

You don’t even know her!



Proteus

I’m planning to know her.



Valentine

You haven’t even met her!



Proteus

Not yet.



Valentine

Oh proteus, you make me laugh



Proteus

I am sorry we don’t agree

We’ve been best friends since we were three



Valentine

Verona is to small for me

Milan, oh, that’s the place to be

Now, thank god, i’m finally free



Valentine & chorus

There’s a million wonderful people in the world

I want to know them all



Proteus, valentine, & chorus

We are brothers,

We are friends

Up until the day that eternity ends.
