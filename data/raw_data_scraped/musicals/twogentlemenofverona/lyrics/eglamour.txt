Eglamour



(from the rear balcony of the theatre.

Eglamour is heard. A thrilling baritone

Voice)



Eglamour

Did i hear someone call my name

It’s been so long and rare

Since someone called my name

Call my name

(eglamour climbs down the ladder

From the balcony to the orchestra.

He wears an army uniform. He carries

The magic dove on his shoulder. He

Is chinese)



Silvia

Eglamour, eglamour



Eglamour

Call me eglamour

It’s been so long since someone did

It sounds so sweet and fair

To hear me called my name once again



Silvia

Eglamour, eglamour



(as eglamour reaches the stage.

A guard moves to stop eglamour.

Eglamour taps the guard who collapses

In slow motion. Eglamour travels to

The top level)



Eglamour

I was always there

You only had to call my name

I’d gladly lose my soul

To save your life

Lucky you

I was there

Lucky me

Now i’m here



(eglamour has now reached silvia.

Proteus runs on the top level.

Eglamour gives him one of his

Magic taps and proteus collapses

In slow motion)



Silvia

Now you’re here



Eglamour

Now i’m here

Your father sent me off to war



Eglamour (cont’d)

I think your father thought

That i’d be killed

No luck

Here i am

Lucky you



Eglamour & silvia

Lucky me

Eglamour & silvia
