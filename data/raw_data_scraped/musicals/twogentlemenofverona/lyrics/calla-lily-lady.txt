Calla Lily Lady


Proteus

I’m very happy

For my best friend

He found a wonderful girl

She’s a calla lily lady

She’s a water lily lady

La la la la la la



Proteus (cont’d)

She must be a very nice person

To fall in love with my friend

She’s a calla lily lady

She’s a water lily lady

La la la la la la



I assume she knows he’s thrifty

What i mean to say is cheap

His i.q. Is fifty

Nevertheless he is deep



So i’m very happy

For my best friend

You’re looking at the picture of glee

I want my best friend

To be ha ha ha happy

But not happier than me

Once again now

But not happier than me



She’s a calla lily lady

She’s a water lily lady

She’s a brocco lily lady

I like brocco lily

Carrots and peas

I want to swoon

Between her knees

Yeah!

Bop ba dop ba dop dop.



So i’m very happy

For my best friend

You’re looking at the picture of glee

I want my friend

To be ha ha ha ha happy

So what if he’s happier than me

Once again now

So what if he’s happier than me

Up the mountain

So what if he’s happier than me

Arroz con pollo

So what if he’s happier than me

A little softer

So what if he’s happier than me ...

Schew.
