To whom It May Concern


I’m to marry thurio

No!

I have a secret lover

Whom i do adore

By my pappy

Sent him off to war

My darlin’s name is

Eglamour

And all my passions do inform his mind



Valentine

(falsetto)

To whom...

(he clears his throat)

To whom shall i send this’



Silvia

You write it. I’ll take care of the rest. Make it fancy.



(valentine picks up a large feather

Quill pen and takes down what she says)



To whom it may concern me

And oh you do

Oh my darlin

My arms and legs and fingers and knees

Long to wrap around your chest and neck and back and legs

And my lips and tongue and teeth long to

Bite these words into your arms and back and ankles



Silvia (cont’d)

And elbows and neck

Do i make myself clear’

I want you

I wouldn’t know a spiritual relationship

If i tripped over it and broke my nose and

My foot and my heart and my hands

All reach out to you and say

Hi there



Save me, eglamour

(silvia lies on counter)

Save me.



(valentine takes a deep, nervous

Breath and repeats her letter,

Tapping it out on the wireless)



Valentine

To whom it may concern

And oh you do

Oh my darlin

My arms and legs and fingers and knees

Long to wrap around your chest and neck and back and legs

And my lips and tongue and teeth long to

Bite these words into your arms and back and ankles

And elbows and neck

Do i make myself clear

I want you



I wouldn’t know a spiritual relationship

If i tripped



(silvia reacts with all her body)



Over it, and broke my nose and

My foot and my heart and my hands

All reach out to you and say

Oh, save me,

Save me silvia, save me



(silvia sits up and reacts to his

Mistake)



Silvia

Eglamour.



Valentine

Eglamour.

(he taps out ‘eglamour’ In morse code)

Eglamour. How shall i send this, my lady’



Silvia

What are the rates’



Valentine

(he shows her a chart)

We have night rates and day rates. The day rates are

More expensive, however ...



/19/ night letter



Silvia

Night letter

So divine

Night letter

Come be mine

Nothing better than a

Hot night letter

Night letter

Oh so cool

Night letter

Hear me drool

Nothing wetter than a

Hot night letter

Did you remember to lick the stamp

Night letter

Did you remember to slap the flap

Night letter

Did you remember you have to say

S-w-a-k

Night letter

Mail it early

Night letter

Avoid the rush

Hope you get a

Night letter



Oh, my father would enforce me to marry a vain and foolish

Suitor of fabulous great wealth to stuff the coffers

Of his government and pay for the vain and foolish

War my father uses for his own ends.

Help me...



Valentine

Valentine.



(silvia falls into valentine’s arms)



Silvia

Help me, valentine.

The marriage is tomorrow

I have to be saved tonight.



Could you save me

Tonight at nine



Valentine

I could save you

Tomorrow at nine



Silvia

That’s too late too late

To escape my fate

Tomorrow noon is my wedding day

Come save me

I want to be very far away

Come save me

When the groom comes

To look for me

I didn’t r.s.v.p.



Valentine

Yes, i could save you

Tonight at eight



Silvia

Wel, tonight at eight

Would be just great



Valentine

I’m your man now

Let me make my plan now



Silvia

It’s a high tower they keep me prisoner in.



Valentine

Silvia

A very very high tower.



Valentine

It’s a high tower

And you’ve got to be saved

By tonight at eight

(guard enters left and carries

Silvia off down left still singing)



O baby



O baby



Valentine

(silvia re-enters and they emrace.

Proteus enters, unobserved)



Silvia

I came in here to write to my lover eglamour.

Instead i found a truer love.



(they kiss. The guard enters left

And carries silvia off again)

Adieu.



Valentine

(whispers joyously)

Eight!



(launce has followed proteus.

Speed enters down left from the

House and sees launce. They yell

Greetings to each other, embrace

And all in a pile of bodies left

Center)



Launce

Speed



Valentine

(to proteus)

How does your lady’ How thrives your love’



Launce

His tales of love were wont to weary you;



Proteus

I know you joy not in love discourse.



Valentine

Ay, proteus, but that life is altered now:



Speed

He has done penance for condemning love,

Love hath chased sleep from his enthralled eyes

And made them watchers of his own heart’s sorrow
