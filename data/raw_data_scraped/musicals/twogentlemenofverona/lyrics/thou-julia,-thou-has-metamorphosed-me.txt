Thou Julia, Thou Has Metamorphosed Me


Proteus (cont’d)

Thou, julia, thou hast metamorphosed me.



Made me neglect my studies, love my time

War with good counsel, set the world at naught;

Made with good musing, weak, hart sick with thought

Pro-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-te-us.



(proteus signs his name with a

Flourish. Julia and lucetta enter,

Carrying rakes and hoes and burlap

Bales. They stop when they see

Proteus. Proteus is terrified at

Their proximity. He tries to

Speak. He runs off)



Julia

(watching him go)

Lucetta, wouldst thou counsel me to fall in love’



Lucetta

Ay, madam, so you stumble not unheedfully.



Julia

What thinkst thou of the gentle proteus’



Lucetta

Lord, lord to se what folly reigns in us.



Julia

How now’ what means this passion at his name



Lucetta

Then, thus, of many good i think him best.



Julia

Your reason’



Lucetta

I have no other than a woman’s reason.

I think him so because i think him so.



Julia

And wouldst thou have me cast my love to him’



Lucetta

Ay, if you thought your love not cast away.



Julia

Why he of all the rest, hath never moved me.



Lucetta

Yet he of all the rest, i think best loves ye.



Julia

His love speaking shows his love but small.



Lucetta

Fire that’s closest kept burns most of all.



Julia

They do not love least that let men know their love.



Lucetta

Oh, the love least that let men know their love.



Julia

I would i knew his mind.



(music. Proteus enters right on

Third level. He sings passionately

To julia)
