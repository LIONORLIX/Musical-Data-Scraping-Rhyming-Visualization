Symphony


Proteus

I’m planning to write a symphony do you mind

If i dedicate this symphony to you’

I’m planning to write a very great book do you mind

If the heroine is very much like you’

Would you mind if i made you immortal’

I naturally ask your permission

I wouldn’t want to make you immortal

Unless you agree to this condition



One girl

Oh, please agree!



Proteus & ensemble

I won’t write a symphony for you

I won’t carve you in stone

If you will not love me forever

Love me forever

Then i will leave you alone.
