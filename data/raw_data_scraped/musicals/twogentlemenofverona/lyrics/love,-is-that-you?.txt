Love, Is That You?


Thurio

Love is that you

That fills my ears

That fills my nose

That fills my heart



Soprano

Love is that you

That fills the air

That fills the sky



Thurio

Love is that you

Speak up

Speak up

Donâ€™t be so shy



Love is that you

Call out your name

Love love hello

Is that you

Speak up

Love love love

Hello hello



Soprano

Hello hello



Thurio

Love was that you
