Summer, Summer


Girl 1

Summer, summer

I was like the summer

Wondering where to go



Girl 2

Autumn, autumn

I was like the autumn

Dying on the vine



Girl 3

Winter, winter

I was like the winter

1-2



Boy 1

My heart was cold as snow



Then



All

Spring, spring

Spring, spring, spring

I am like the spring



Quartet

Now that you are mine

Cool as a cucumber

Fresh as sweet may wine

Love reminds me of me,

Love reminds me of me,

I am like all seasons



Love reminds me of me

You are wonderful

You are great

You remind me of me



All

I am nervous

I am shaking

Love reminds me of me



We are fantastic

We are terrific

We remind me of us



Spring, spring, spring, spring, spring

Love reminds me of me

Spring, spring, spring, spring

Love reminds me of me
