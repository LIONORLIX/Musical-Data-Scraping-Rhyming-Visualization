I Am Not Interested In Love


Julia

I am not interested in poetry

Poetry’s another word for love

I am not inetested in music

Music is another word for love

I’m not really int’rested in romance

I’m not really int’rested in love love love

I find love alarming

I’m happier farming



I do not care too much for passion

Passion’s just a masquerade for love

I do not care that much for caring

Caring’s just a careless word for love

Frankly i don’t even care for people

I’m not really int’rested in love love love

I only deal with what i feel with
