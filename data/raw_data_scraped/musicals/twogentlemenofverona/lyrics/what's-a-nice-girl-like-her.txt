What's A Nice Girl Like Her


Proteus

What’s a nice girl like her

Doing in this place

Why are nice lips like hers

Kissing his

What’s a nice heart like hers

Doing on her sleeve

What’s a nice heart like mine

Doing in my mouth

I should have stayed down south

I want to kiss her mouth



Still

It makes me ill

I’ve had my fill

Of that silly billy

Playing jack to her jill

It makes me ill

I need a pill

I’ll sing a thrill



Now i am angry

La la la

La la la

What’s a nice girl like her

Doing in this place

Lighting her christmas tree ornaments

Up in my face



I’m glad i didn’t stay south

I want to kiss her mouth, yah!

(proteus jumps into the tent)



(silvia jumps out of the tent followed

By eglamour followed by proteus.

Eglamour exits. Silvia watches

Escaping eglamour; then turns on

Proteus)



Silvia

Oh, miserable unhappy that i am.



Proteus

What i would not undergo for one calm look!

O, ‘tis the curse of love, and still approved,

When women cannot love where they’re beloved!



Proteus (cont’d)

If the gentle spirit of moving words

Can in no way change you to a milder form,

I’ll woo you like a soldier, at arm’s length,

And love you ‘gainst the nature of love ‘- force ye.

(proteus forces silvia to the

Ground)



Silvia

O heaven!



Proteus

I’ll force thee. Yield to my desire.

(and he plops himself on top of

Her. Starts to kiss her. He

Removes his glasses.



Valentine enters left platform.

Crosses down left of proteus & silvia.

Silvia giggles in delight. They be-

Come aware of valentine. Proteus puts

On his glasses)

Valentine!

(proteus & silvia untangle & silvia

Falls into the tent)



Valentine

Proteus, i must never trust thee more,

But count the world a stranger for thy sake.

O time must accurst,

‘Mongst all foes that a friend should be the worst!



Proteus

(on his knees)

My shame and guilt confound me.



(eglamour enters right platform)



Eglamour

Charge.
