Love's Revenge


Valentine

No appetite

Love took it away

To show me how starved i was

Love’s revenge



Insomnia

Love gave it to me

To show me i didn’t dream

Love’s revenge



The little i sleep

Is just for a nightmare

The little i eat

Is to taste the dregs

Where is my reason’

What is my name’

What is this terrible shake in my legs’



My future plans

Love took them away

To show me i had no future

Love’s revenge



Valentine (cont’d)

I have no future

I have no past

Without love

Nothing can last



Without love

Nothing can last

That’s love

That’s love’s revenge
