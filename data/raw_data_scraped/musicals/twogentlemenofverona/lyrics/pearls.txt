Pearls


Launce

I leaned down to kiss you

And your pearls got in my mouth

Your pearls got in my mouth

So i brushed back the pearls

And kissed your mouth



I leaned down to love you

And your pearls caught on the sheet,

Your pearls caught on the sheet

So i took off the pearls

And put ‘em in the ashtray



Then you said that you loved me

You said you loved me

And nothing got in the way



Launce

You didn’t choke

You didn’t joke

You just said you loved me

And the pearls came out of your mouth

The pearls came out of your mouth

And made a necklace fit

For the emperor of milan
