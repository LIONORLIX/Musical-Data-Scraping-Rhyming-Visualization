Something to Be Proud Of


There's a story that my daddy tells religiously

Like clockwork every time he sees an opening

In a conversation about the way things used to be

Well I'd just roll my eyes and make a bee-line for the door

But I'd always wind up starry-eyed, cross-legged on the floor

Hanging on to every word

Man, the things I heard



It was harder times and longer days

Five miles to school, uphill both ways

We were cane switch raised, and dirt floor poor

'Course that was back before the war

Yeah, your uncle and I made quite a pair

Flying F-15's through hostile air

He went down but they missed me by a hair

He'd always stop right there and say...



That's something to be proud of

That's a life you can hang your hat on

That's a chin held high as the tears fall down

A gut sucked in, a chest stuck out

Like a small town flag a-flyin'

Or a newborn baby cryin'

In the arms of the woman that you love

That's something to be proud of



Son graduatin' college, that was mama's dream

But I was on my way to anywhere else when I turned 18

Cuz when you gotta fast car you think you've got everything

I learned quick those GTO's don't run on faith

I ended up broken down in some town north of L.A.

Working maximum hours for minimum wage

Well, I fell in love, next thing I know

The babies came, the car got sold

I sure do miss that old hot rod

But you sure save gas in them foreign jobs

Dad, I wonder if I ever let you down

If you're ashamed how I turned out

Well, he lowered his voice, then he raised his brow

Said, lemme tell ya right now



That's something to be proud of

That's a life you can hang your hat on

You don't need to make a million

Just be thankful to be workin'

If you're doing what you're able

And putting food there on the table

And providing for the family that you love

That's something to be proud of



And if all you ever really do is the best you can

Well, you did it man



That's something to be proud of

That's a life you can hang your hat on

That's a chin held high as the tears fall down

A gut sucked in, a chest stuck out

Like a small town flag a-flyin'

Or a newborn baby cryin'

In the arms of the woman that you love

That's something to be proud of

That's something to be proud of

Yeah, that's something to be proud of

That's something to be proud of

Now that's something to be proud of
