Don't Be Afraid of Romance


Don't be afraid of romance

Don't be so frightened, come on take a chance



Don't stop to question is this the real thing

Don't be afraid to let go

Don't run away till you know



Romance is best while you're young

That's when the sweetest of love songs are sung



That's when your daydreams are filled with moonlight

Don't be afraid when you start

You have nothing to lose but your heart
