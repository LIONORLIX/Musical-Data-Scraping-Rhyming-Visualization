Glad to Be Home


I'm so glad to be home again

I promise never to roam again

It's oh so good to be home again



I could cry, I'm so happy

I'm back where I had to be

Awfully glad to be home



My heart suddenly mends again

Among my neighbors and friends again

As I start tying loose ends again



I could cry, I'm so happy

There's no need of askin' me, certainly you can see

Just why I'm glad to be home
