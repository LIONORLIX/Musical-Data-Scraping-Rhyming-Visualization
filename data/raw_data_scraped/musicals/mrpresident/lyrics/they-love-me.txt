They Love Me


[Verse:]

Oh! What a trip

What a wonderful trip

And to think that I was worried

At the start of the trip

I must confess that I was filled with doubt

But there was really nothing to worry about



[1st refrain:]

They love me, they love me

I'm welcome everywhere with open arms



They love me, they love me

I never knew I had so many charms



In Pakistan they took me sailing on a lovely lake

In India they let me see a mongoose kill a snake



Because they love me, they love me

And they want me to come back again



[2nd refrain:]

They love me, they love me

In Tokyo they think that I'm a dream



They claimed me and named me

"America's Ambassador Supreme"



They always have a banquet on the day that I arrive

In Borneo they made me eat an octopus alive



Because they love me, they love me

And they want me to come back again



[3rd refrain:]

They love me, they love me

With every place I visit it's the same



They meet me and greet me

With every kind of present you can name



A chieftain in New Guinea with his forehead painted red

Presented me with a poison arrow and a shrunken head



Because they love me, oh they love me

And they want me to come back again



[3rd refrain:]

They love me, they love me

I smile when I'm presented with a key



In Thailand 'twas my land

I spent a happy day from two to three



The day I left Arabia my seat was full of bumps

They made me ride a camel where I sat between the humps



Because they love me, they love me

And they want me to come back

They want me to come back

They want me to come back again
