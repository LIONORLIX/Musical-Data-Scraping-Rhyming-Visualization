This Is a Great Country/Finale


Patriotism has gone out of fashion

We seem to think our patriotic days are dead

We used to sing of our homeland with passion

But now we seem to shy away from it instead

I think it's time to hit the nail right on the head



This is a great country, a great country

So let's shout it clear and loud

Take a look in your hist'ry book

And you'll see why we should be proud

Hats off to America

The home of the free and the brave

If this is flag waving, flag waving

Do you know of a better flag to wave?
