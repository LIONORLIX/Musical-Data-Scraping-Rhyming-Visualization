In Our Hide-Away


In our hide-away, far from all the fuss that bothers us

We'll hide-away, we two



In our hide-away, we'll be all alone, no telephone

To worry me or you



We will have a ball

Busy doin' nothing at all



In our hide-away, we will lock the door and throw away the key

What a holiday, our hide-away will be
