It Gets Lonely in the White House


It gets lonely in the White House when your cares begin

And the White House is a big place to be lonely in

When you're all alone there staring into space

And you wish the man you ran against could be there in your place



It gets lonely in the White House when you've been attacked

By the loyal opposition getting in the act

If you make the wrong decision, when the final chips are down

The White House is the loneliest place in town



It gets lonely in the White House when you're sitting there

And you have to do your thinking in a rocking chair

When some exercise would keep you feeling well

But a journey to the golf course and the country's gone to hell



When the budget isn't balanced and you're in the red

And you feel it would be better to be dead than red



When your speech is optimistic but the stocks keep tumblin' down

The White House is the loneliest place in town
