Empty Pockets Filled With Love


[1]

Empty pockets but a heart full of love

A heart full of love for you



Cash not any, not one red penny

But kisses many for you



Empty pockets but a heart beating fast

As fast as the stars above



Please say that you'll get by with just a guy

With empty pockets filled with love



[2]

You can't eat love, you can't drink love

You can't wear love like you would a gown



I trust love but just love

Won't pay for caviar

Won't buy that motor car

Or a house in town



You can't spend love, you can't lend love

You must end love when the chips are down



Love flies out the window when there's nothing to eat

Nothing to drink, nothing to wear but a frown

And the chips are down
