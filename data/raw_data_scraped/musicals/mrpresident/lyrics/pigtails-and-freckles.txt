Pigtails and Freckles


Pigtails and freckles, braces on your teeth

Who would have thought you would turn out so beautiful?



Awkward and bashful, scared right from the start

Who would have thought you would turn out so smart?



Changes, many changes, since I first looked at you,

Funny, very funny, what a few years can do



Pigtails and freckles, braces on your teeth

Who would have thought they'd become so sublime?

I would have thought, for I thought so all the time
