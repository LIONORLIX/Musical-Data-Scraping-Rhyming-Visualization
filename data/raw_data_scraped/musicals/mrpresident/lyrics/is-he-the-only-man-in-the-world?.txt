Is He the Only Man in the World?


Is he the only man in the world

That you will always love and adore?



Look just as good to you in the morning

As he did the night before?



Out of a hundred million or two

Is he the only one for you?



If he's the only man in the world come rain or shine

Then he's a man like mine



[Male version:]

Is she the only girl in the world

That you will always love and adore?



Look just as good to you in the morning

As she did the night before?



Out of a hundred million or two

Is she the only one for you?



If she's the only girl in the world come rain or shine

Then she's a girl like mine
