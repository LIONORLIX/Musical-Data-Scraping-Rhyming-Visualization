I Gotta Crow (Reprise)


I've gotta crow!

I'm just the cleverest fellow

'Twas ever my fortune to know;

I give the sign and the sunlight will shine

And the forest will grow

And the rivers will flow

I've gotta crow!



-Oh Peter, you are the most wonderful boy in the world!

Is there anything that you couldn't do?



-Nothing!



-Peter, will you teach me how to crow?



-Sure!



You'll do it too



-Me!?



-Yes!

And if you choose

You will find such unusual things you can do



-Ugh-u-u-uh...



-You're getting warm but

Your mouth should be forming a happier



-Ugh-ur-r-r!



-Don't be such a sissy, prim and prissy

Let out the crow!

You've nothing to fear

Come and whisper it close to my ear...



-ugh ugh ugh

Ugh ugh ugh

UGH UGH UGH!

-That's better



And now we can crow

Ugh ugh ugh

Just like a rooster we'll be

Our own booster and let out the crow

Ugh ugh ugh

We'll give the proudest and gayest

And loudest crow that we know

Everybody let go

Ugh ugh ugh

And crow

Ugh ugh ugh

Ugh ugh ugh

Ugh ugh ugh



Tender shepherd

Tender shepherd

Let me help you hold your sheep

One in the meadow

Two in the garden

Three in the nursery

Fast asleep...



Will you treat me with respect?

(Yes, sir!)

Let me have a little peace and quiet?



(We will always try to be so quiet

Quieter than mice!)



Oh wouldn't that be nice!



We will grow up

(They will grow up)

We will mind the P's and Q's

(They will mind the P's and Q's)

We will never be a bother

(They will never be a bother

And we'll always shine your shoes)

Oh do think of all those shoes!

???

We trying to grow up

Trying to grow up,

Trying to grow up

Like me,

Like I,

Like me.



JANE:

Peter Pan, will you teach me how to fly!



PETER PAN:

Oh Jane, Jane...

First I must blow the fairy dust on you!

Ah!



Now come with me where dreams are born,

And time is never planned.

Just think of lovely things.

And your heart will fly on wings,

Forever in Never Never Land.
