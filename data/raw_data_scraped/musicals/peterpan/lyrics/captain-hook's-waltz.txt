Captain Hook's Waltz


HOOK:

I'm the greatest villain of all time!

Who is Blue Beard?

(Nobody!)

Who is Nero?

(Nobody!)

Who is Jack the Ripper?

(Nobody!)

Ahahaha!

Who's the swiniest swine in world?

(Captain Hook! Captain Hook!)

Who's the dirtiest dog in this wonderful world?

(Captain Hook! Captain Hook!)

Captain of villainy

Murder and loot

Eager to kill any

Who says that his hook isn't cute!

(It's cute!)

Ahahahah!



Slimiest rat in the pack?

(Captain Hook! Captain Hook!)

Who's unlaughable?

(You!)

Who's unliftable?

(You!)

Whose existence is quite unforgivable?

(You!)

Who would stoop to the cheapest and lowest

Of tricks in the book?

(Tricks in the book)

Blimey, slimy,

Captain Hook!
