Tarantella


Hook:



Me thinks I see a spark, a gleam, a glimmer of a plan

With which, perhaps, it may redeem me honor as a man

Kidnap Wendy, seize the boys, and you'll have Hook to thank

For when the time is ripe you'll see the children walk the plank!



Oh, when was such a princely plot concocted by another

To murder all the boys and keep the Wendy for our mother

Hey!



La la la ...



All: when was such a princely plot concocted by another

To murder all the boys and keep the Wendy for our mother



Hook: Hey!

(bravo!)

Bravo!

(bravo!)

Bravo!

(yoho!)

Yoho!

(yoho!)

Yoho!

(to the ship!) To the ship! (to the ship!) To the ship! (to the ship!)

To the ship!
