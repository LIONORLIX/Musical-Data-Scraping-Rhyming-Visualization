I Won't Grow Up


PETER PAN:

Are you ready for today's lesson?



ALL:

Yes, Peter!



PETER PAN:

Listen to your teacher. Repeat after me:

I won't grow up,

(I won't grow up)

I don't want to go to school.

(I don't want to go to school)

Just to learn to be a parrot,

(Just to learn to be a parrot)

And recite a silly rule.

(And recite a silly rule)

If growing up means

It would be beneath my dignity to climb a tree,

I'll never grow up, never grow up, never grow up

Not me!

Not I,

Not me!

Not me!

I won't grow up,

(I won't grow up)

I don't want to wear a tie.

(I don't want to wear a tie)

And a serious expression

(And a serious expression)

In the middle of July.

(In the middle of July)

And if it means I must prepare

To shoulder burdens with a worried air,



I'll never grow up, never grow up, never grow up

Not me,

Not I,

Not me!

So there!

Never gonna be a man,

I won't!

Like to see somebody try

And make me.

Anyone who wants to try

And make me turn into a man,

Catch me if you can.

I won't grow up.

Not a penny will I pinch.

I will never grow a mustache,

Or a fraction of an inch.

'Cause growing up is awfuller

Than all the awful things that ever were.

I'll never grow up, never grow up, never grow up,

No sir,

Not I,

Not me,

So there!



I won't grow up!

(I won't grow up)

I will never even try

(I will never even try)

I will do what Peter tells me

(I will do what Peter tells me)

And I'll never ask him why

(And I'll never ask him why)



We won't grow up!

(We won't grow up)

We will never grow a day

(We will never grow a day)

And if someone tries to make it

(And if someone tries to make it)

We will simply run away

(We will simply run away)



I won't grow up!

(I won't grow up)

No, I promise that I won't

(No, I promise that I won't)

I will stay a boy forever

(I will stay a boy forever)

And be banished if I don't!

(And be banished if I don't)



And Never Land will always be

The home of youth and joy and liberty

I'll never grow up, never grow up, never grow up

Not me!

Not me!

Not me!

Not me!

No sir!

Not me!
