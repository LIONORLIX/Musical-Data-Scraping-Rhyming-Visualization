Wendy


PETER PAN:

We'll need lots of wood

Need lots of leaves

Need lots of paint

But hush hush hush hush hush...



Let's be quiet as a mouse

And build a lovely little house

For Wendy

Oh for Wendy

She's come to stay



ALL:

We have a mother,

At last we have a mother!



PETER PAN:

Home sweet home

Upon the wall

A welcome mat

Down in the hall for Wendy

So that Wendy

Won't go away!



ALL:

We have a mother,

At last we have a mother!



PETER PAN:

Oh what pleasure

She'll bring to us

Make us pockets and sing to us

Tell us stories we've been longing to hear

Over and over!



She'll be waiting at the door

We won't be lonely anymore

Since Wendy

Lovely Wendy's here to stay



(Whistling)



ALL:

We have a mother,

At last we have a mother!



(Whistling)



ALL:

We have a mother,

At last we have a mother!



PETER PAN:

Oh what pleasure

She'll bring to us

Make us pockets and sing to us

Tell us stories we've been longing to hear

Over and over!



She'll be waiting at the door

We won't be lonely anymore

Since Wendy



ALL:

Lovely Wendy's here to stay

We have a mother,

At last we have a mother!



PETER PAN:

She'll be our mother,

It's nice to have a mother!



ALL:

Wendy's here to stay!
