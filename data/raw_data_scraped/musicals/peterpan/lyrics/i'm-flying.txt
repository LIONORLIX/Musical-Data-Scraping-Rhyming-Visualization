I'm Flying


PETER and CHILDREN:

I'm flying

(Flying, flying, flying)

Look at me way up high,

Suddenly here am I

I'm flying.



I'm flying

(Flying, flying, flying)

I can soar

I can weave and what's more

I'm not even trying



High up, and as light as I can be.

I must be a sight lovely to see.



I'm flying.

(Flying, flying, flying)

Nothing will stop me now:

Higher still look at how

I can zoom around,

'Way up off the ground

I'm flying.



I fly and I'm all over the place

You try and you fall flat on your face



I'm flying.

(Flying, flying, flying)

Over bed, over chair

Duck your head, clear the air

Oh, what lovely fun

Watch me everyone

Take a look at me

A see how easily it's done

I'm flying!



CHILDREN:

Oh, teach us Peter, please, teach us!



PETER PAN:

First I must blow the fairy dust on you!

(blows)

Shhh...

Shhh...

Shhh...

Now think lovely thoughts



ALL:

Think lovely thoughts

Think lovely thoughts

Fishing

Hoopskirt

Candy!



Picnics

Summer

Candy!



Sailing

Flowers

Candy!



Lovelier thoughts, Michael!



Christmas?!



PETER PAN:

Ah, ah, flying!

Like an owl, like a bat,

Or the crow,

It's so satisfying!



I'm whizzing

Through a cloud

Past the star

I'm so proud

Look how far I breeze in

High over the moon

Higher I fly

By old mister moon

Wave me goodbye



I'm flying.

(Flying, flying, flying)

Heading far out of sight

Second star to the right

Now the way is clear

Never Land is near

Follow all the air

Cause I'm about to disappear

I'm flying!
