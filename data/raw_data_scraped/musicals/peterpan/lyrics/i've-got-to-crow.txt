I've Got to Crow


Not me,

It's just that I am what I am

And I'm me!

When I look at myself

And I see in myself

All the wonderful things that I see

If I'm pleased with myself

I have ev'ry good reason to be.



I've gotta crow!

I'm just the cleverest fellow

'Twas ever my fortune to know;

I taught a trick to my shadow

To stick to the tip of my toe

I've gotta crow!



I've gotta brag!

I think it's sweet

I have fingers and feet I can wiggle and wag.

I can climb trees and play tag with the breeze

In the meadows below

I've gotta crow!



If I were a very ordinary

Ev'ry day thing,

I'd never be heard cock-a-doodling

'Round like a bird!



So Naturally

When I discover the cleverness of a remarkable me,

How can I hide it

When deep down inside it just tickles me so

That I've gotta let go and crow!



I'm really a rare thing,

Such a fair thing,

I can't keep still!

I'm bursting with pride

And I just couldn't keep it inside

If I tried so...



Naturally

When I discover the cleverness of a remarkable me,

How can I hide it

When deep down inside it just tickles me so

That I've gotta let go and crow!
