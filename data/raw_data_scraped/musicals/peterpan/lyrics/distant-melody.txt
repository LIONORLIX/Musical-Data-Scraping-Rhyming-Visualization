Distant Melody


PETER PAN:

Once upon a time and long ago

I heard someone singing

Soft and low

Now when day is done

And night is near

I recall this song I used to hear

My child, my very own,

Don't be afraid, you're not alone

Sleep until the dawn

For all is well

Long ago this song was sung to me

Now it's just a distant melody

Somewhere from the past I used to know

Once upon a time

And long ago...
