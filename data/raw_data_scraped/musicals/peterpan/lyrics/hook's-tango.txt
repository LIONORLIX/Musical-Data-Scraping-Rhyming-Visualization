Hook's Tango


To cook a cake quite large

And fill each layer in between

With icing mixed with poison

Til it turns a tempting green



(icing mixed with poison

Til it turns a tempting green)



We'll place it near the house

Just where the boys are sure to come

And being greedy they won't care to

Question such a plum



(the boys who have no mother sweet)

No one to show them their mistake

(won't know it's dangerous to eat)

So damp and rich a cake-



And so before the winking of an eye

Those boys will eat that poison cake

And one by one they'll die-



(they'll die they'll die they'll die they'll die they'll die-!

Ole!
