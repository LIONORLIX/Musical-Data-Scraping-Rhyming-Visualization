Beauty's Been Decreased (Beauty and the Beast)


NASAL VOICE:

He he he he he



MALE VOICE:

Beauty and the beast



MRS. POTTS:

Show as old as time

Worn as it can be

Oversized and grand

Then someone is canned

Unexpectedly

Just a little change

Says the Disney Beast

Profit's growing thin

Downsizing is in

Beauty's been decreased



First a missing spoon

Then a fired fork

(Bye bye!)

Then the chorus boys

Are replaced by toys

Even in New York



Pink slips everywhere

No food at the feast

Wigs are all a mess

And they took my dress

Beauty's been decreased

Since we're in the red

Like a shrunken head

Beauty's been decreased



(in an extremely high falsetto)



Beauty's been decreased
