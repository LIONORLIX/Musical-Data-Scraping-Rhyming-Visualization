Joseph and the Amazing High "C" (Any Dream Will Do)


JOSEPH:

When you revive

A Webber/Rice show

Though it's a nice show

It's not so new

So get a hot

Good looking dummy

Who bares his tummy

Any hunk will do



Call Charlie Sheen

Or Greg Lougainous

Although they're heinous

People sit through

Keith Caradine

And David Cassidy

Play to capacity

Any hunk will do



When business starts

To taper off

They call in David Hasselhoff

Or sign a Donny Osmond type

Who has a low IQ



So call the boys

From Dukes of Hazzard

And they'll sing as heard

On Channel Two

Take off their shirts

And bare their nipples

Box office triples

Any hunk will do



Give them a TV star

A daytime TV star

Give them a TV star

A naked TV star



[Thanks to Garrett for lyrics]
