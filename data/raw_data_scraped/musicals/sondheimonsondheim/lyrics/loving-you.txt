Loving You


[FOSCA]

Loving you

Is not a choice

It's who I am



Loving you

Is not a choice

And not much reason

To rejoice

But it gives me purpose

Gives me voice

To say to the world:



This is why I live

You are why I live



Loving you

Is why I do

The things I do

Loving you

Is not in my

Control

But loving you

I have a goal

For what's left of my life...



I will live

And I would die

For you
