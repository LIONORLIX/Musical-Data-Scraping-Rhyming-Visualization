Opening Doors


[FRANK, spoken]

How's it going?



[CHARLEY, spoken]

Good. You?



[FRANK, spoken]

Fair.



[CHARLEY, spoken]

Yeah, tell me.



[The phone rings; FRANK answers]



[FRANK, spoken]

Chinese laundry.



[MARY is at her desk, phoning]



[MARY, spoken]

Hi.



[FRANK, spoken to CHARLEY]

Mary.



[CHARLEY, spoken]

Say hello.



[MARY]

I think I got a job.



[FRANK, spoken]

Where?



[MARY, spoken]

True Romances



[FRANK, spoken]

Posing?



[MARY, spoken]

Thank you. Writing captions.



[FRANK, spoken]

What about the book?



[MARY, spoken]

What about the book?



[FRANK, spoken]

Nothing, are you working on the book?



[MARY, spoken]

Yes...

[FRANK, spoken]

Good.



[MARY, spoken]

No...



[FRANK]

Mary—



[MARY, spoken]

Right, I know, yes, me and Balzac...



[CHARLEY]

I finished the one-act



[FRANK]

I got an audition—



[MARY]

I started the story



[FRANK]

Rehearsal pianist



[CHARLEY]

So where are we eating?

[MARY]

I'm moving to Playboy



[FRANK]

The publisher called me



[CHARLEY]

I'm doing a rewrite



[MARY]

My parents are coming



[FRANK]

I saw My Fair Lady



[CHARLEY]

I rewrote the rewrite



[FRANK]

I sort of ?njoyed it



[MARY]

I threw out the story



[CHARLEY]

I'm meeting an ag?nt



[FRANK, CHARLEY & MARY]

We'll all get together on Sunday



We're opening doors

Singing, "Here we are!"

We're filling up days on a dime

That faraway shore's

Looking not too far

We're following every star—

There's not enough time!



[The stage becomes alive with activity: CHARLEY being interviewed by an AGENT; FRANK playing the same bars of rehearsal music over and over while DANCERS rehearse; MARY meeting a musician on a subway. The three come together once again.]



[FRANK]

I called the producer



[CHARLEY]

I sent off the one-act



[MARY]

I started the story



[FRANK]

He said to come see him



[CHARLEY]

I dropped out of college



[MARY]

I met this musician



[FRANK]

I'm playing a nightclub



[CHARLEY]

They're doing my one-act!



[MARY]

I'm working for Redbook



[FRANK]

I rewrote the ballad



[MARY]

I finished the story



[CHARLEY]

We started rehearsals



[MARY]

I threw out the story

And then the musician

I'm moving to Popular Science



[FRANK, CHARLEY & MARY]

We're opening doors

Singing, "Look who's here!"

Beginning to sail on a dime

That faraway shore's

Getting very near!

We haven't a thing to fear—

We haven't got time!



[FRANK, spoken]

How's it coming?



[CHARLEY, spoken]

Good. You?



[FRANK, spoken]

Done!



[CHARLEY, spoken]

One minute...



[The phone rings; FRANK answers]



[FRANK, spoken]

Hamburg Heaven.



[MARY, spoken]

Hi.



[FRANK, spoken to Charley]

Mary.



[CHARLEY, spoken]

Say hello.



[MARY]

I got another job.



[FRANK, spoken]

Where?



[MARY, spoken]

"Chic."



[FRANK, spoken]

What's that?



[MARY, spoken]

A brand-new concept:

Pop-up pictures.



[FRANK, spoken]

What about the book?



[MARY, spoken]

What about the book?



[FRANK, spoken]

Did you give the publisher the book?



[MARY, spoken]

Yes...



[FRANK, spoken]

Good.



[MARY, spoken]

No...



[FRANK, spoken]

Mary—



[MARY, spoken]

Look, I never—



[CHARLEY rips the paper out of the typewriter]



[CHARLEY, spoken]

Finished!



[FRANK, spoken into phone]

Let me call you back.



[MARY, spoken]

Right.



[Hangs up]



[CHARLEY, spoken]

This is just a draft.



[FRANK, spoken]

Right.



[CHARLEY, spoken]

Probably it stinks.



[FRANK, spoken]

Right.



[CHARLEY, spoken]

Haven't had the time to do a polish—



[FRANK, spoken]

Will you sing!



[CHARLEY, spoken]

Right.

(sung)

Who wants to live in New York?

Who wants the worry, the noise, the dirt, the heat?

Who wants the garbage cans clanging in the street?

Suddenly I do!



[During the above, JOE JOSEPHSON has appeared and started to listen judiciously; FRANK and CHARLEY are auditioning for him.]



[CHARLEY]

They're always poppin' their cork—

(spoken)

I'll fix that line—

(sung)

The cops, the cabbies, the salesgirls up at Saks

You gotta have a real taste for maniacs—

Suddenly I do!



[JOE]

That's great! That's swell!

The other stuff as well

It isn't every day

I hear a score this strong

But fellas, if I may

There's only one thing wrong:



[Singing to FRANK'S tune]



There's not a tune you can hum

There's not a tune you go bum-bum-bum-di-dum—

You need a tune to go bum-bum-bum-di-dum—

Give me a melody!



Why can't you throw 'em a crumb?

What's wrong with letting 'em tap their toes a bit?

I'll let you know when Stravinsky has a hit—

Give me some melody!



Oh sure, I know

It's not that kind of show

But can't you have a score

That's sort of in between?

Look, play a little more

I'll show you what I mean...



[CHARLEY, overselling]

Who wants to live in New York?

I always hated the dirt, the heat, the noise

But ever since I met you, I—



[JOE]

Listen, boys

Maybe it's me

But that's just not a

Hum-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mable melody!



Write more, work hard—

Leave your name with the girl

Less avant-garde—

Leave your name with the girl

Just write a plain old melodee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee...



[He is humming "Some Enchanted Evening"—incorrectly.]



Dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee...



[He exits. FRANK, CHARLEY and MARY meet dejectedly.]



[CHARLEY]

They're stopping rehearsals

They ran out of money...



[MARY]

We lasted one issue

My book was rejected



[FRANK]

The nightclub was raided

I have to start coaching



[MARY]

My parents are coming



[CHARLEY]

They screwed up the laundry



[FRANK]

My wallet was stolen



[MARY]

I saw the musician



[CHARLEY]

We're being evicted



[MARY]

I'm having a breakdown



[ALL]

We'll all get together on Sunday



They're slamming the doors

Singing, "Go away!"

It's less of a sail than a climb

That faraway shore's

Farther every day

We're learning to ricochet

We still have a lot to say...



[FRANK]

You know what we'll do?



[CHARLEY, spoken]

What?



[FRANK]

We'll do a revue



[CHARLEY, spoken]

What?



[MARY, spoken]

What?



[FRANK]

We'll do a revue of our own!



[MARY, spoken]

What?



[CHARLEY, spoken]

Where?



[MARY, spoken]

Why?



[CHARLEY, spoken]

When?



[FRANK]

Not just songs, but stories, scenes, piano pieces, mime—



[CHARLEY, spoken]

Yeah!



[MARY, spoken]

"Frankly Frank!"



[FRANK]

A showcase of our own!



[CHARLEY, spoken]

Where?



[FRANK, spoken]

The club's reopening.



[MARY, spoken]

We'll write a lot of new stuff—



[CHARLEY, spoken]

Rewrite old stuff—



[FRANK, spoken]

What about the girl?



[CHARLEY, spoken]

What about the girl?



[FRANK, spoken]

Only that we're gonna need a girl.



[CHARLEY, spoken]

Well, Mary—



[MARY, spoken]

Thanks, I don't perform except at dinner.



[TWO GIRLS have entered and hold rehearsal copies of music, ready to audition. The FIRST GIRL starts, singing shrilly and off-key as FRANK plays.]



[FIRST GIRL]

Who wants to live in New York?

Who wants the worry, the noise, the dirt, the heat

Who wants the garbage cans clanging in the street—



[FRANK, spoken]

Thank you, but we're looking for someone with more experience.



[SECOND GIRL (BETH)]

They're always popping their cork—



[FRANK, spoken]

Up a tone.



[BETH]

The cops, the cabbies, the salesgirls up at Saks—



[FRANK, spoken]

Up a tone.



[BETH]

You gotta have a real taste for maniacs—



[FRANK, spoken]

Thank you. You're hired.



[BETH]

I'm Beth



[FRANK]

I'm Frank



[BETH]

I really thought I stank



[MARY]

I'm Mary



[CHARLEY]

Charley



[FRANK]

By the way

I'm told we open Saturday



[CHARLEY, MARY & BETH, spoken]

What?!



[MARY]

You're not serious!



[CHARLEY]

Nobody's ready!



[FRANK]

Apparently someone cancelled a booking.



[CHARLEY]

The songs aren't finished



[MARY]

And what about costumes?



[BETH]

And how do I learn all these numbers?



[They all sing the following lines simultaneously]



[FRANK]

I'll bring you the copies of everything later this evening



[BETH]

Okay, but I'll have to have all of the music

And Saturday I've got to sing at a wedding

Oh God, is there dancing, 'cause I'm not a dancer



[CHARLEY]

Not to mention I still haven't finished the

Synanon song or the Kennedy number



[FRANK]

You don't have to, we'll segue the

End of it into the dance we cut out...



[CHARLEY]

And what'll we do about getting publicity

Run around town putting stickers on windows



[MARY]

And have we decided or not on the restaurant sketch?

I need two or three days to replace it...



[FRANK]

No, we'll use it but not with the long introduction...



[FRANK, CHARLEY, MARY & BETH]

We'll worry about it on Sunday!



We're opening doors

Singing, "Here we are!"

We're filling up days on a dime

That faraway shore's looking not too far

We're following every star—

There's not enough time!



We're banging on doors

Shouting, "Here again!"

We're risking it all on a dime

That faraway shore's looking near again

The only thing left is when

We know we should count to ten—

We haven't got time!

We haven't got time!
