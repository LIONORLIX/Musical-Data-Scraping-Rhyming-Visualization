I Had a Lot of Trouble with My Mother...


[STEPHEN SONDHEIM, spoken]

I had a lot of trouble with my mother in getting along with her. And?she,?she, she didn't?really want a child. But she?was very much in love, I think, with my father, even obsessed with him. So when he left her, which he did for another woman, the wrath of God had nothing on her. And, um, she unfortunately tried to make me pay for the sins of my father. And so it was not a very good relationship. And if it hadn't been for the Hammersteins, I really don't know where I would be, if I'd even be alive.
