You Could Drive a Person Crazy


[MAN]

You



[WOMAN, spoken]

What?



[MAN]

Could drive a person crazy

You could drive a person mad



[WOMAN, spoken]

Ugh



[MAN]

First you make a person hazy

So a person could be had



[WOMAN, spoken]

Yeah, yeah, yeah



[MAN]

Then you leave a person dangling sadly

Outside your door

Which it only makes a person gladly

Want you even more



[WOMAN, spoken]

Thank you for sharing

You



[MAN, spoken]

Yes?



[WOMAN]

Could drive a person buggy

You could blow a person's cool

First you make a person feel all huggy

While you make her feel a fool



[MAN, spoken]

Wah, wah, wah, wah



[WOMAN]

When a person says that you've upset her

That's when you're good

You impersonate a person better

Than a zombi? should



[MAN]

I could understand a person



[WOMAN]

I could understand a p?rson

[MAN]

If she wasn't good in bed



[WOMAN]

If he said to go away



[MAN]

I could understand a person



[WOMAN]

I could understand a person



[MAN]

If she actually were dead



[WOMAN]

If he happened to be gay



[WOMAN & MAN]

But worse than that

A person that

Titillates a person and then leaves her / him flat

Is crazy

You're a troubled person

You're a truly crazy person

Yourself!

[WOMAN, spoken]

I'm so glad we're having this little chat.



[MAN, spoken]

I'm glad you're glad.

(sung)

When a person's personality is personable

She shouldn't oughta sit like a lump



[WOMAN, spoken]

Excuse me?



[MAN]

It's harder than a matador coercin' a bull

To try to get you off of your rump



[WOMAN, spoken]

Hey!

(sung)

So single and attentive and attractive a man

Is everything a person could wish



[MAN, spoken]

Exactly.



[WOMAN]

But turning off a person is the act of a man

Who likes to pull the hooks out of fish



[WOMAN & MAN]

Knock, knock, is anybody there?

Knock, knock, it really isn't fair

Knock, knock, I'm working all my charms

Knock, knock, a zombie's in my arms



All that sweet affection!

What is wrong?

Where's the loose connection?

How long, O Lord, how long?



[MAN]

Barbara baby, Barbara bubi. Barbara



[WOMAN]

You could drive a person crazy



[MAN]

You could drive a person buggy



[WOMAN]

You could drive a person mad



[MAN]

You could blow a person's cool



[WOMAN]

First you make a person hazy



[MAN]

Get a person feeling huggy



[WOMAN]

So a person could be had



[MAN]

While you make her feel a fool



[WOMAN & MAN]

Exclusive you

Elusive you

Will any person ever get the juice of you?



[WOMAN]

You're crazy



[MAN]

You're crazy



[WOMAN]

You're a lovely person



[MAN]

You're a lovely person



[WOMAN]

You're a moving



[MAN]

Deeply maladjusted



[WOMAN]

Never to be trusted



[WOMAN & MAN]

Crazy person

Yourself!
