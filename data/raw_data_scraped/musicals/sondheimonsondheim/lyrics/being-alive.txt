Being Alive


[ROBERT]

Someone to hold you too close

Someone to hurt you too deep

Someone to sit in your chair

To ruin your sleep...



[MAN, spoken]

That's true, but there's more than that.



[MAN, spoken]

Is that all you think there is to it?



[MAN, spoken]

You've got so many reasons for not being with someone, but Robert, you don't have one good reason for being alone.



[MAN, spoken]

Come on. You're on to something, Bobby. You're on to something.



[ROBERT]

Someone to need you too much

Someone to know you too well

Someone to pull you up short

And put you through hell



[MAN, spoken]

You see what you look for, y'know?



[MAN, spoken]

You're not a kid anymore, Robert. I don't think you'll be a kid again, kiddo.



[WOMAN, spoken]

Hey, buddy. Don't be afraid it won't be perfect... the only thing to be afraid of really is that it won't be.



[WOMAN, spoken]

Don't stop now. Keep going.



[ROBERT]

Someone you have to let in

Someone whose feelings you spare

Someone who, like it or not

Will want you to share

A little, a lot...



[WOMAN, spoken]

And what does all that mean?



[MAN, spoken]

How do you know so much about it when you've never been there?



[MAN, spoken]

It's much better living it than looking at it, Robert.



[MAN, spoken]

Add 'em up, Bobby. Add 'em up.

[MAN, spoken]

Blow out the candles, Robert. Make a wish.



[WOMAN, spoken]

Want something.



[MEN and WOMEN, spoken]

Want something!



[ROBERT]

Somebody hold me too close

Somebody hurt me too deep

Somebody sit in my chair

And ruin my sleep

And make me aware

Of being alive, being alive



Somebody need me too much

Somebody know me too well

Somebody pull me up short

And put me through hell

And give me support

For being alive

Make me alive

Make me alive

Make me confused

Mock me with praise

Let me be used

Vary my days

But alone is alone, not alive



Somebody crowd me with love

Somebody force me to care

Somebody let me come through

I'll always be there

As frightened as you

To help us survive

Being alive, being alive

Being alive!
