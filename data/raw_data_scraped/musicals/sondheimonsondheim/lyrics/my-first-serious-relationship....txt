My First Serious Relationship...


[STEPHEN SONDHEIM, spoken]

My first serious relationship occurred when I was sixty years old and I fell in love. And I think it didn't happen 'til then because I wasn't open for it; I wasn't ready for it. I was brought up as an only child. I enjoyed being an only child. I enjoyed being alone. I still enjoy often being alone. But I think I'd gotten in the habit of it. And when I met somebody, the habit got broken.
