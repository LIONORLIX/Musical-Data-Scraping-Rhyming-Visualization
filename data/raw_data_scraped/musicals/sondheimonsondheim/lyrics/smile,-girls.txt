Smile, Girls


[ROSE]

What you must keep in mind as the act curtains part

Is a primary law of theatrical art

Namely



Smile, girls

And you'll lay them in the aisle, girls

If you smile, girls

They'll die on the spot



Smile, girls

Drive 'em crazy with your youth, girls

Flash a tooth, girls

Give 'em everything you got—

Which ain't an awful lot



Smile, girls

Or we're never gonna work, girls

Just a smirk, girls

Might well save the day

Get style, girls

And the customers will stay



So smile, Agnes

Smile, Dolores

Smile, Thelma

Smile, Whateveryournameis

Smile, Edna

Smile, Marjorie May



Smile, girls

Look deliriously clever

And whatever

Happens

Smile

No matter what



When the scenery smacks you



[GIRL 1]

Smile



[ROSE]

When a stagehand attacks you



[GIRL 2]

Smile



[ROSE]

When they boo in the gallery



[GIRL 3]

Smile



[ROSE]

When I don't pay your salary

[GIRLS]

Smile



[ROSE]

When the comedy's dying, smile

When you all feel like crying, smile

When tomatoes are flying—duck

But



[ROSE & GIRLS]

Smile



[ROSE]

Smile, girls

And when the act begins to sag

Drag out the flag—

And smile!
