Something Just Broke


[HOUSEWIFE]

I was out

In the yard

Taking down the bed sheets

When my neighbor yelled across:

I remember where I was

Just exactly where I was

In the yard out back—



[OFFICE CLERK]

I was getting me a shoeshine—



[HOUSEWIFE]

—Folding sheets—



[CLERK]

—When I heard—



[COUPLE]

We were waiting for a carriage—



[CLERK]

—Newsboys—



[COUPLE]

Suddenly there's shouting in the street—



[HOUSEWIFE]

—Lizzie's sheets...



[VOICE, spoken]

"The president's been shot."



[CLERK]

I'll remember it forever—



[HOUSEWIFE]

...And I thought:



[CLERK]

—Where I was, what I was doing—



[HOUSEWIFE]

Something just broke



[VOICE, spoken]

"The president's been shot."



[CLERK]

My God—!



[HOUSEWIFE]

Something just broke

[STOCKBROCKER]

I was down at the Exchange...



[HOUSEWIFE]

Something just made a little dent



[LADY]

I'd been shopping...



[OLD MAN]

I'd been sick...



[HOUSEWIFE]

Something just broke—



[PAWNBROKER]

All I know, it was a Friday...



[HOUSEWIFE]

—Only for a moment



[OTHERS]

I remember it exactly...



[HOUSEWIFE]

Something got bent

[WAITRESS]

I'm taking the order—



[HOUSEWIFE]

Something just left a little mark



[SCHOOLBOY]

I was getting dressed...



[WAITRESS]

—Two potato soups...



[HOUSEWIFE]

Something just stirred



[VARIOUS]

And I thought—

And I thought to myself—



[WOMAN 1]

Something just woke



[VARIOUS]

And I thought—

I kept thinking



[ALL]

Something just spoke

Something I wish I hadn't heard

Something bewildering occurred

Fix it up fast

Please—

'Til it's just smoke

'Til it's only something just passed

Nothing that will last



[VARIOUS]

Where I was, what I was doing



[ALL]

Nothing but the moment

Just an awful moment

But—

Something just broke

Something just broke

Something just—



[STEPHEN SONDHEIM, spoken]

The show that's closest to exactly what the book writer and I wanted, I'd say is Assassins. Every time I see it I can't think of ways to improve it. And I can't say that about any other show.
