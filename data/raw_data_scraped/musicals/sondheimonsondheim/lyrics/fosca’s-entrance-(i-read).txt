Foscaâ€™s Entrance (I Read)


[STEPHEN SONDHEIM, spoken]

In 1983 I saw a movie called Passione d'amore that was directed by Ettore Scola and I knew immediately I wanted to make a musical of it. It has a weird story. It's about an ugly, sickly woman in the nineteenth century who falls in love with a handsome soldier. And the surprise of the story is, somehow he falls in love with her, through the sheer force of her love for him. I gave it to James Lapine, and we wrote Passion.



[FOSCA, spoken]

I so enjoyed the novel by Rousseau.



[GIORGIO, spoken]

It's wonderful. My favorite, really.



[FOSCA, spoken]

The character of Julie is a great mystery.



[GIORGIO, spoken]

Then you should have kept it longer, to meditate on.



[FOSCA]

I do not read to think

I do not read to learn

I do not read to search for truth

I know the truth

The truth is hardly what I need

I read to dream



I read to live

In other people's lives



I read about the joys

The world

Dispenses to the fortunate

And listen for the echoes



I read to live

To get away from life!



No, Captain, I have no illusions

I recognize the limits of my dreams

I know how painful dreams can be

Unless you know

They're merely dreams



There is a flower

Which offers nectar at the top

Delicious nectar at the top

And bitter poison underneath

The butterfly that stays too long

And drinks too deep

Is doomed to die

I read to fly

To skim!

I do not read to swim



I do not dwell on dreams

I know how soon a dream becomes an expectation

How can I have expectations?

Look at me

No, Captain, look at me

Look at me!

I do not hope for what I cannot have!

I do not cling to things I cannot keep!

The more you cling to things

The more you love them

The more the pain you suffer

When they're taken from you



Ah, but if you have no expectations

Captain

You can never have a disappointment



[STEPHEN SONDHEIM, spoken]

During the course of the story, Fosca pursues Giorgio relentlessly. She humiliates him in public. She follows him in public. She embarrasses him in public. Until finally she pushes him over the edge.
