Beautiful


[OLD LADY]

Changing

It keeps changing

I see towers

Where there were trees



Going

All the stillness

The solitude

Georgie



Sundays

Disappearing

All the time

When things were beautiful...



[GEORGE]

All things are beautiful

Mother

All trees, all towers

Beautiful

That tower—

Beautiful, Mother

See?

A perfect tree



Pretty isn't beautiful, Mother

Pretty is what changes

What the eye arranges

Is what is beautiful



[OLD LADY]

Fading...



[GEORGE]

I'm changing

You're changing



[OLD LADY]

It keeps fading...



[GEORGE]

I'll draw us now before we fade

Mother



[OLD LADY]

It keeps melting before our eyes



[GEORGE]

You watch

While I revise the world

[OLD LADY]

Changing

As we sit here—

Quick, draw it all, Georgie!



[OLD LADY & GEORGE]

Sundays—

Disappearing



[OLD LADY]

As we look



[GEORGE]

Look!...

Look!...



[OLD LADY]

You make it beautiful

(spoken)

Oh, Georgie, how I long for the old view
