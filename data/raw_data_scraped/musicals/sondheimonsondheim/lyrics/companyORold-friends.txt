Company/Old Friends


[COMPANY]

Phone rings

Door chimes

In comes company!

No strings

Good times

Just chums, company!

Late nights

Quick bites

Party games

Deep talks

Long walks

Telephone calls

Thoughts shared

Souls bared

Private names

All those

Photos

Up on the walls

"With love..."



With love filling the days

With love seventy ways

"To Bobby with love"

From all these

Good and crazy people, your friends

Hey, old friend

These good and crazy people, your married friends!

Are you okay, old friend?

How do we stay old friends



Who is to say, old friend

Are you okay, old fri?nd?

What do you say, old friend?

Are we or ar? we unique?



Time goes by

Everything else keeps changing

You and I

We get continued next week



Most friends fade

Or they don't make the grade

New ones are quickly made

And in a pinch, sure, they'll do

But us, old friend

What's to discuss, old friend?

Here's to usâ€”

Who's like us?

Damn few!
