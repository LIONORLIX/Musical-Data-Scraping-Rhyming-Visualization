Talent/When I Get Famous


[Part 1: Talent]



When I was a tyke

I said, "What I like

Is art

I know I'm a boy

But what I enjoy

Is art"



Looking at paintings, going to plays

Music and books informing my days

Filling my mind

Flooding my heart

With art!



I had this dream of becoming an artistâ€”

A painter, a poet, who knows?

I had a nice little talent for drawing

And a natural feeling for prose

I even began to compose



[Part 2: When I Get Famous]



Ever since I can remember

I've had a secret dream in my heart

Looking forward

To the day I could start

My climb up the path

The path to the stars

The stars of acclaim, applause, and fame



When I get famous, I'll be free

On my own, you wait and see

Lost or dependent I'll never b?

I'll get there alon?, somehow

When I get famous

Everybody will bow

Let them laugh at me now

For they can't shake my dream



Once the chance comes I'll take my cue

One good break, I'm telling you

That's all I need to make my dream true
