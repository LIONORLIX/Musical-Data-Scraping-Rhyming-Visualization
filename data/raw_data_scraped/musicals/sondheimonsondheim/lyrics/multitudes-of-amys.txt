Multitudes of Amys


[ROBERT]

Multitudes of Amys

Crowd the streets below

Avenues of Amys

Officefuls of Amys

Everywhere I go

Wonder what it means

Ho-ho,?I?wonder what it?means

I see them waiting for the?lights

Running for the bus

Milling in the stores

And hailing cabs

And disappearing?through?revolving?doors



Multitudes of Amys

Everywhere?I look

Sentences of?Amys

Paragraphs of Amys

Filling every book

Wonder if it means I've gone to pieces

Every other word I speak is something she says



[STEPHEN SONDHEIM, spoken]

Well, we changed the plot, so "Multitudes of Amys" doesn't work. Or it didn't work. So we needed another ending. And I decided that what I would do is write a song which was Bobby's assessment of the marriages he's seen, which he was disillusioned with. And he sang a song called "Happily Every After."
