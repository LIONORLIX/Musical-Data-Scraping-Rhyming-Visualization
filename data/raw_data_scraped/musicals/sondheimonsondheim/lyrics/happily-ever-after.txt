Happily Ever After


[ROBERT]

Someone to hold you too close

Someone to hurt you too deep

Someone to love you too hard

Happily ever after



Someone to need you too much

Someone to read you too well

Someone to bleed you of all

The things you don't want to tellâ€”

That's happily ever after

Ever, ever, ever after

In hell



[STEPHEN SONDHEIM, spoken]

But unfortunately, "Happily Ever After" struck Hal Prince as what he called "a downer", and he wanted to end the show on a more positive note. So I took the same idea and rewrote it as a song called "Being Alive" with one major difference that makes the song work really well. Which is that the song is constantly interrupted with little interspersed urgings by the couples to Bobby to get married.
