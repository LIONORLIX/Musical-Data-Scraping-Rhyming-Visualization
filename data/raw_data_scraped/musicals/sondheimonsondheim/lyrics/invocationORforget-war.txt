Invocation/Forget War


[PROLOGUS]

Gods of the theater, smile on us

You who sit up there stern in judgment, smile?on?us

You who look?down on actors

(spoken)

And who doesn't?

(sung)

Bless our?little company and smile on us

Think not about deep concerns

Think?not?about?dark dilemmas



[PROLOGUS & COMPANY]

We offer?you song and?dance

We offer you rites and revels

We offer you jokes and insults

We offer you grace and beauty

Bless our play and smile



[COMPANY]

Forget war, forget woe

Forget matters weighty and great

Allow matters weighty to wait

For a while

For this moment, this brief time

Frown on reason, smile on rhyme



Forget pomp, forget show

Forget laurels, helmets and crowns

Receive lovers, liars and clowns

For a while

For this moment, this brief span

Celebrate the state of man



[STEPHEN SONDHEIM, spoken]

That was the first part of a song called "Forget War", which was the original opening of Forum when Jerry Robbins was going to direct it. But Jerry decided not to, and he was replaced with George Abbott, and George Abbott didn't like the song. He couldn't hum it, he said. So out it went.
