Take Me to the World


[ELLA]

Let me see the world

With clouds

Take me to the world

Out where I can push

Through crowdsâ€”

Take me to the world



A world of skies

That's bursting with surprise

To open up my eyes

For joy



Take me to the world

That's real

Show me how it's done

Teach me how to laugh

To feel

Move me to the sun



Just hold my hand

Whenever we arrive

Take me to the world

Where I can be alive



We shall see the world come tru?

We shall have the world

I won't b? afraid with you

We shall have the world



I'll hold your hand

And know I'm not alone

We shall have the world

To keep

Such a lovely world

We'll weep

We shall have the world

Forever

For our own
