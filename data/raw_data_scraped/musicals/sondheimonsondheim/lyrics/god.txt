God


[STEPHEN SONDHEIM, spoken]

This is my studio. I work lying down, for obvious reasons: it allows you to take a nap whenever you want to. And I also use very soft lead pencils, they're called Blackwings, and it means that they wear out very quickly, so you can spend a lot of time—



[Pencil sharpener whirs]



—sharpening. These pencils are very hard to find.



[COMPANY]

God

I mean the man's a god

Wrote the score to Sweeney Todd

With a nod

To de Sade—

Well, he's odd

Well, he's God



[SONDHEIM, spoken]

I write on yellow pads. I prefer the kind that have exactly thirty-two lines on them, because it means that you can make alternate choices of words in between the two lines. If there are too many lines, there isn't enough space.



[COMPANY]

Smart!



[SONDHEIM, spoken]

If there are too few lines, there's too much space.



[COMPANY]

The lyrics are so smart!

And the music has such heart—

It has heart?

Well, in part

Let's not start—

Call it art

No, call it—

God!



[SONDHEIM, spoken]

I do use a computer to write on occasionally, but mostly to transcribe lyrics. And to make things look professional.



[COMPANY]

Well, you have to have

Something to believe in

Something you can celebrate

Celebrate

Venerate—

Something like



Venetian pottery

Old movies

Butterflies

Politics

Wine

Picasso

Skiing

Stamps

Musicals!

It might as well be musicals!

And when it comes to musicals—



(spoken)

I like the score of Rent!

Shh, later!

Me too!

Not now

Really, Rent?

[SONDHEIM, spoken]

The hardest thing about writing, for me, is getting started. It's the first words on the yellow pad. You have to lose your inhibition so that you can afford to say something, perhaps corny or cliched. I use—I've often used, anyway—alcohol to help me lose the inhibitions. I sip out of a, out of a shot glass, because once you're through an ounce and a half of liquor, if you want more, you have to get up and get more.



[COMPANY]

Nice smile

Sweet face

Real style

Such grace

That wit—

That's it!



[SONDHEIM spills a bowl of pencils off the piano.]



[SONDHEIM, spoken]

Oh, shit.



[COMPANY]

And does he know how to rhyme!

Sublime...

He'll surprise you every time



You never know just where the

Chords are going next

Just like the lyrics—

No, the "text"

You think the tune is going up

It's going down

You think the tune is going on

It stops

It doesn't finish, it just stops



(spoken)

You know what I like best? His flops



(sung)

Anyone can whistle

That's what they say—



(spoken)

Later

Yeah



(sung)

Still you have to have

Something to believe in

Something to appropriate

Emulate

Overrate—

Might as well be Stephen



[SONDHEIM, spoken]

And this box contains my fingernail clippings. I'm thinking of sending them to the Smithsonian.



[COMPANY]

Or, to use his nickname

God!

We've got God!

Look who's God!

He's still—



(spoken)

Turn him off and let's just sing the damn songs.



(sung)

Amen!
