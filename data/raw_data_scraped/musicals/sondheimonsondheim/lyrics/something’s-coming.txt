Something’s Coming


[QUARTET]

Could be (Could be)

Who knows?

There’s something due any day—

I will know right away

Soon as it shows

It may come cannonballing down through the sky

Gleam in its eye

Bright as a rose

Who knows?



It’s only just out of reach

Down the block, on a beach

Under a tree

I got a feeling there’s a miracle due

Gonna come true

Comin’ to me!



Could it be? Yes, it could

Something’s coming, something good

If I can wait (If I can wait, if I can wait)

Something’s coming, I don’t know what it is

But it is

Gonna be great!



With a click, with a shock

Phone’ll jingle, door will knock

Open the latch (Open the latch, open the latch)

Something’s coming, don’t know when, but it’s soon

Catch the moon

One-hand?d catch!



Around the corner

Or whistling down the riv?r

Come on, deliver

To me! (To me, to me)



Will it be? (Will it be?) Yes, it will (Yes, it will)

Maybe just by holding still (Maybe just by holding still)

It’ll be there (It'll be there)

Come on, something, come on in, don’t be shy

Meet a guy

Pull up a chair!



The air

Is humming

And something great is coming!



Who knows?

It’s only just out of reach

Down the block, on a beach

Maybe tonight (Maybe tonight, maybe tonight)

Maybe tonight (Maybe tonight, maybe tonight)

Maybe tonight (Maybe tonight, maybe tonight)

Maybe tonight
