[BONNIE, spoken]

Now, our studio audience would love to know how you two work together.



[FRANK, spoken]

Oh, sure.



[CHARLEY, spoken]

No. May?I?answer that?



[BONNIE, spoken]

Oh, please?do.



[CHARLEY, spoken]

How we work together.

He goes—

[Mimes playing an elaborate arpeggio]

And I?go—

[Mimes typing, in similar elaborate fashion]



(sung)

And soon we're humming along—

Hmmm-hmmm-hmmm

And that's called writing a song—

Hmmm-hmmm-hmmm

Then he goes—

[Plays another arpeggio]

And I go—

[Types]



And the phone goes—

(spoken)

Brrrring!

And he goes—



[Mimicking FRANK into an imaginary phone]

"Mutter mutter mutter mutter yes, Jerome

Mutter no, Jerome

Mutter mutter mutter mutter—"



[To BONNIE]

That's his lawyer, Jerome



[Back into the "phone"]

"Mutter mutter mutter mutter mutter do it, Jerome"

[Hangs up, turns back to himself]

Sorry, Charley—



[Plays the arpeggio, as himself]

(sung)

So I go—

[Types]

And he goes—

[Arpeggio]

And I go—

[Types]

And soon we're tapping away—

Hmmm-hmmm-hmmm

[Mimicking an intercom]

(spoken)

Bzzz!

"Sorry, Charley."

Bzzz!



[To BONNIE]

It's the secretary—

Bzzz!

On the intercom—



[As FRANK]

"Yes, Miss Bzzz..."



[Nasal, as the secretary]

"It's a messenger..."



[As FRANK]

"Thanks, Miss Bzzz

Will you tell him to wait?

Will you order the car?

Will you call up the bank?

Will you wire the coast?

Will you—"

Drrrrrring!

"Sorry, Charley..."

[Into the "phone" again]

"Mutter mutter mutter mutter sell the stocks

Mutter buy the rights

Mutter mutter mutter mutter mutter—"

Bzzz!



[Into "phone"]

"Let me put you on hold..."

"Yes, Miss Bzzz..."

"It's the interview..."

"Thanks, Miss Bzzz

Will you tell him to wait?

Will you wire the car?

Will you order the coast?

Will you send up the bank?..."

(sung)

And the telephones blink

And the stocks get sold

And the rest of us, he keeps on "hold"

And he's into making movies

And he's now a corporation

Right?



So I play at home

With my wife and kids

And I wait to hear the movie bids

And I've got a little sailboat

And I'm into meditation

Right?



He flies off to California

I discuss him with my shrink

That's the story of the way we work

Me and Franklin Shepard, Inc.



[BONNIE, spoken]

It seems to me you think making money is a bad thing for an artist.



[CHARLEY, spoken]

Money?

Did I say money?

(sung)

No, I like money a lot—

Hmmm-hmmm-hmmm

I mean, it's better than not—

Hmmm-hmmm-hmmm

(spoken)

But when it's—



[Grunts like a pig and stars grabbing imaginary money]

Money—

[Grunt, grunt]

Money—

[Snorts, gathering money like a manic, drooling octopus]

When you're into—

[Snort]

Money—

[Lightly]

And you should be—



[Plays an imaginary arpeggio, then gestures to Frank]

Listen, Frank does the money thing very well, but you know what? Other people do it better. And Frank does the music thing very well. And you know what? No one does it better.

(sung)

Still the telephones blink

And the buzzers buzz

And I really don't know what he does

But he makes a ton of money

And a lot of it for me—

Right?



So I think "Okay!"

And I start a play

And he somehow knows

'Cause right away

It's drrrring!



[Into "phone" again, as Frank]

"Hiya, buddy

Wanna write a show?

Got a great idea

We'll own all the rights

With a two-week out

And a turnaround

On the guarantee

Plus a gross percent

Of the billing clause—"



And there I am in California

Talking deals and turning pink

Back in business and I mean just that

Back with Franklin Shepard, Inc.



Very sneaky how it happens

Much more sneaky than you think

Start with nothing but a song to sing

Next you're Franklin Shepard—



(spoken)

Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. See, Frank and I are not that kind of close. The way we used to be. And friendship is like a, a garden. You have to water it, and tend it, and care about it. And you know what? I miss it and I want it back. Look—



(sung)

Nothing permanent has happened

Just a temporary kink

Friendship's something you don't really lose



Very sneaky how it happens

Every day you're on the brink

First the prizes, then the interviews—



[Looks around, realizing where he is]



Oh, my God, I think it's happened!

Stop me quick before I sink

One more triumph that I can't refuse



[Into the camera]

(spoken)

In case you didn't notice, this is my first time on TV—and my last.



[To BONNIE]

(sung)

No, here's the point, whatever happens

Then we'll all go have a drink



[Gestures toward Frank]

That's the guy I love, the fella who's

Inside



[Into "phone"]

"Mutter mutter mutter mutter quick, Jerome

Get the President

There's a crazy man

On my TV screen!"



[To camera]

Inside—

Bzzz! Bzzz! Drrring!

Inside

Franklin Shepard—

(spoken)

Just write him folks, care of Any Bank, U.S.A.—
