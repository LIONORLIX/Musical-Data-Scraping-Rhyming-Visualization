We Had Three Endings to Company...


[STEPHEN SONDHEIM, spoken]

We had three endings to Company. The first one involved Bobby proposing to the girl named Amy. In the present version of Company she gets married at the end of the first act. But in the first version of Company, the marriage broke up and she didn't get married. So he proposed to her in the second act. And he went through all the sets of all the couples in the play on his way to Amy's kitchen to ask her to marry him. And he sang a song called "Multitudes of Amys."
