I’ve Often Been Asked Why I Don’t Write...


[STEPHEN SONDHEIM, spoken]

I've often been asked why don't I write my own librettos, because often the songs seem to be libretto-like songs. And there are two reasons. The first, and more important one, is that I think playwriting is too difficult and I don't think I could ever write a play.



Second, however, is I love collaborations. And it may be because I'm an only child, and I miss the family that you get—I would miss the family that you get when you're working with someone. Even if it's just one other person, it's like having a brother. Or if it's two or three other people, it's like having a small family. And the putting on of a musical, you get that family feeling. And that gives me a great deal of courage to go on. And it also gives me a feeling of warmth and, and, you know, to put it as a cliché, the show is like having a baby. And it's something you make and you nurture and you give life to. So that's why I love collaborations.
