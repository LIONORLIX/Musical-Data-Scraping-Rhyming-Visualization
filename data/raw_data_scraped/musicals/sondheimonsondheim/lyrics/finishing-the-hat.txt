Finishing the Hat


[GEORGE]

Yes, she looks for me

Good

Let her look for me to tell me why she left me—

As I always knew she would

I had thought she understood

They have never understood

And no reason that they should

But if anybody could...



Finishing the hat

How you have to finish the hat

How you watch the rest of the world

From a window

While you finish the hat



Mapping out a sky

What you feel like, planning a sky

What you feel when voices that come

Through the window

Go

Until they distance and die

Until there's nothing but sky



And how you're always turning back too late

From th? grass or the stick

Or the dog or the light

How th? kind of woman willing to wait's

Not the kind that you want to find waiting

To return you to the night

Dizzy from the height

Coming from the hat



Studying the hat

Entering the world of the hat

Reaching through the world of the hat

Like a window

Back to this one from that



Studying a face

Stepping back to look at a face

Leaves a little space in the way like a window

But to see—

It's the only way to see



And when the woman that you wanted goes

You can say to yourself, "Well, I give what I give."

But the woman who won't wait for you knows

That however you live

There's a part of you always standing by

Mapping out the sky

Finishing a hat

Starting on a hat

Finishing a hat...

Look, I made a hat

Where there never was a hat
