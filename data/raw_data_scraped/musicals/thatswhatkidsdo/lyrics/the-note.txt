The Note


Oh my Gosh!

She?s gonna make me read this?

I really don?t need this

I can?t believe this is happening to me!



If Jen had been a little faster

The note would have made it past her

And she wouldn?t have noticed it

But there was a little mess up

Now I?ve got to fess up

How will I ever get over this



I feel so nervous might pass out

Hey, that?s not a bad way out

I guess this is my final bow

We should just plan my funeral now



I can see tomorrow?s headlines now:

Girl 10 dies from embarrassment after reading note!

Oh it?s so sad! Look at everybody!

She was so nice?

Yeah, I used to copy off her math paper?

She once shared her M&M?s with me?

I never knew I had so many friends!



Take me back to the last class, an hour ago

When life was sweet before the note

Here it ends before I?m old enough to vote

All because that stupid note!



I had such a promising future!



As I prepare for the end now

Let me just say now

I?ve tried to be true without fail

And to my classmates

Don?t make the same mistake

Next time just use E-mail



In just a moment I?ll be at rest

At least I?ll miss that spelling test

I?ll catch my breath and here I go

I?ll stand up tall and read the note



Oh I feel faint?



Fare thee well to my dear friends

I am sorry this is how it had to end

Sometimes you?re high sometimes you?re low

Sometimes you die all because of a stupid note



Repeat 1st chorus
