The Night Before


What if she calls me Margret?

I can?t find my green shirt!

I feel sick!

I am not a morning person!



You think you?ve got problems?



I can?t believe she?s gonna make me go through this

She knows I don?t learn anything, before noon or one



I am simply not programmed for activities at nine!



The night before, so much is up in the air

Chaos everywhere

Hopes on a wing and a prayer for tomorrow

The night before, so much is at stake

Another month of summer [would] be great

Instead I?ll learn my fate, tomorrow



Why can?t I be home schooled?

Just think of how much help I?d be around the house?



I just have this feeling I?m gonna walk in,

the day will begin hello Margret

And I?ll be too afraid to say I?m Maggie



And It's Margret, Margret, Margret,

how are you tonight?!

I?ll be Margret, Margret, Margret

the rest of my life!



Where is my red shirt?



The night before

Emotions are running righ

A wild combination inside

Scared but also excited, ?bout tomorrow

The night before
