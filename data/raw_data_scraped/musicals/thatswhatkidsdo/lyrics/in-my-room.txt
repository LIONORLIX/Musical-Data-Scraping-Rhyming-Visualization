In My Room


In my room, no one can judge me

In my room, I have endless possibilities

In my room



In my room I can dance to a full house

The crowd just roars, and begs more, more?

But I wave goodbye, and fly away

I can fly in my room



In my room, no one can bug me

In my room, I am anything I want to be

In my room



In my room I can dance to a full house

The crowd just roars, and begs more, more?

But I wave goodbye, and fly away

I can fly in my room



In my room, no one can bug me

In my room, I am anything I want to be

In my room



In my room
