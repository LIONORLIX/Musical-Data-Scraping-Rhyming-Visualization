Summer Sun


Some people like the winter that?s cool

They like the snowy tree tops glistening, and the Yule

But I prefer to feel a summer sun beating down

My feet burning up a path on the summer ground



Give me the Summer Sun (4x)



We?ll go for a stroll along the boardwalk

We?ll be sipping our sodas over a talk

In the summer sun?

We?ll kick up the sand along the beach

As the waves come within our reach

In the summer sun?



All of the flower?s show their colors in June

And even the birds seem to sing a Beach Boy?s tune

I?ll stay up all night, under a radiant moon

And in the morning, I?ll sleep as late as I want to



Give me the summer sun (4x)



We?ll go to the movies and carnival

We don?t have to worry anymore

In the summer sun

It?s just a picnic every day

Come and meet me by the bay

In the summer sun?



I?ll be laughing by the pool

Drifting on a raft all afternoon

In the summer sun

Then we?ll have some barbecue

It?s the summer thing to do

In the summer sun?
