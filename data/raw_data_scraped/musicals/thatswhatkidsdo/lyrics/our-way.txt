Our Way


They want to play

We say ok

The least little fuss

They want to blame us

So hear what I say

This is our plea

So can you see our way?



A game of football

We like to play hard

One little fall

Call the National Guard

So hear what I say

This is our plea

So can you see our way?



And since we?re talking

I am sorry ?bout the window

I hoped you?d forget

My ball missed the net

Oops?

We did it our way

Our way?
