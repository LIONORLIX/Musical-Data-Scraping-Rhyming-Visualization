Long Walk from Kindergarten


It?s a long walk from kindergarten

It?s a long walk to first grade

It?s a long walk from kindergarten

I hear the big kids say, those were the days!



Where?s the cookies?

Forget about it

Story time?

Ya gotta live without it

What?s this homework thing every night?

Those are the facts, ya better tow the line



Chorus



Where?s the big books?

They?re history

Circle time

Sorry kid

Centers and hubs

Get over it

Get with the program, and you?ll do fine



I recall fondly those half days

There was time for everything

A little work

A little play

Such a good balance

Those were the days!



Chorus
