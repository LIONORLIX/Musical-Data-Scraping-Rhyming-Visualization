That's What Kids Do! 1


Think I?ll take off my shoes

and I?ll run outside in the rain

Come on and I?ll race you

?Cause that?s what kids do



We?re on a search for

the biggest puddle we can find

Come on and jump in

?Cause that?s what kids do



Care for a mud pie my friend

Oh yes please, and with plenty of leaves

and sticks mixed in!



If you see me by days end,

and I?m all covered with dirt

Don?t let me alarm you

?Cause that?s what kids do



Got my room half cleaned up,

Mom, isn?t that enough?

I Need to dance and play

Oh what a great day!



I know my homework isn?t done

Can?t I finish later on?

I need to have some fun

?Cause that?s what kids do
