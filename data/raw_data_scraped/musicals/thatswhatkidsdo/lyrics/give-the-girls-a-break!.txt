Give the Girls a Break!


Life on the playground

It?s such a battlefield,

everytime the boys play

Hey boys, give the girls a break



We start a friendly game of freeze tag

And before you know it, they?re tackling lads

So hey boys, give the girls a break



My mother tells me that it?s just a phase, yeah right

And some day they are going to change, hard to believe

I?m always willing to start anew

But it?s so hard when every day they?re chasing you



So I am careful and stay on guard

You never know when they will charge

So hey boys, give the girls a break

Hey boys, give the girls a break!
