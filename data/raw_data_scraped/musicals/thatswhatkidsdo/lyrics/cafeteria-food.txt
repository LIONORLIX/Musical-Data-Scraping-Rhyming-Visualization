Cafeteria Food


Doc. I think it started in September

When I went back to school

I?ve been feeling kind of weak in the knees

And my face looks a little blue

I?ve heard stories of incredible bravery

Where kids survived all 12 grades

Tell me how they do it

Tell me before it?s too late



Cafeteria Food

Fine school cuisine

Cafeteria food

Guaranteed to keep you lean

Oh save me from cafeteria food?



Today I think I had Salisbury steak

At least I hope it was that

?Cause I?ve been told by upper grades who know

The fried chicken is really fried rat

You can dismiss this as just kid rumor

But these are my people, why shouldn?t I believe?

They say it?s documented that it?s just policy



Cafeteria Food

Fine school cuisine

Cafeteria food

Guaranteed to keep you lean

Oh save me from cafeteria...

Oh save me from cafeteria...

Oh save me from Cafeteria food (repeat)



Spoken: Except for the pizza
