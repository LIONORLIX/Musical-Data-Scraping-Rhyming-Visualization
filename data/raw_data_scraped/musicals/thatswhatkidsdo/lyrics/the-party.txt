The Party


The party, the party,

Everyone?s talkin? ?bout the party

This one, that one, the party?s all I hear?

How could she forget me?

Doesn?t she remember that I sat next to her last year?

The party, the party everyone?s talkin? ?bout the party

The walls are talkin? ?bout the party

Everyone is going, but me!
