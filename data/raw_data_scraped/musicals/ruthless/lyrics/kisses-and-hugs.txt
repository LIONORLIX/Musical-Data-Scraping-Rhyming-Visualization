Kisses And Hugs


Tina.

(eager to change the subject.)

I’m so very lucky that

You are my mother

If i had to choose

I would not choose another

Mommy and daddy



Judy.

And Tina makes three



Tina.

No other parents could ever be

As loving as my parents are to me.



(Judy tears up.) Why are you crying, mother?



Judy. Oh, Tina...

Accidents happen

That no one foresees...



Tina. I gotta run lines.

Judy. What?

Tina. I mean pray for Louise. (Smiles.)



Judy.

You're taking this tragedy well

And that's grand

But if you want to cry

Or hold mommy's hand

Or even stop smiling I’d understand,



Tina.

I'm good.



Judy. (Taken aback.) Good. (Stands.) Ill make you a sandwich.



Tina. (Quickly.)

1 think that my mommy

Could use some more kisses



Judy.

Ill trade them for hugs



Together.

Oh what bliss this is
