To Play This Part


Tina.

To dance my dances

To sing my song

It’s all I’ve wanted

Alli've dreamed

My whole life long

Now that dream is coming true

It’s time for my debut

Doi want this? Yes i do!

With all my heart

It means everything

To play this part



Miss thorn.

Thank you, Tina.

(Tina exits, miss thorn motions into the wings.)

Hang on, Rachel. I am pleased to announce our cast

Has been invited on a school trip to new york city to

See a matinee performance of Henry VIi, part two,

Followed by dinner at the world-famous olive garden,

Times Square! Now here's Rachel Hobbs.

(Miss Thorn exits, Tina steps out from the wings.)



Tina.

I love puppies

And Santa Claus

But they don't hold a candle

To applause

I pray to you on high

The casting agent in the sky

Cast me! Cmon!

I'll stay true to my art

Playing pippi, dare i say

Is my ticket to Broadway

It means everything

To play this part

(Tina remains onstage. Miss thorn enters.)



Miss Thorn.

I want to thank all our talented students, and some of our not-so-talented ones. Really, Rachel Hobbs, what on earth were you doing? This year we Are fortunate indeed. Not only is mike lerman, owner Of legman’s hardware, donating all the materials, he’s going to build our sets. And his wife, Betty Legman, along with all the gals at betty’s needle nook, is designing and making our costumes!
