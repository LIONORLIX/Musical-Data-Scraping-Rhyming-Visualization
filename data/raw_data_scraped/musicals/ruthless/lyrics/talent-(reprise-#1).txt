Talent (Reprise #1)


Sylvia.

She'll look every inch the star

In what i bought her

Now if she just remembers

All Iâ€™ve taught her...

Tonight we launch a new career

It won't be long before they cheer

And give her a standing ovation

First comes fortune then comes fame

Then the Tina doll and the Tina game,

She's going to become a corporation!



Judy. Stop it, Sylvia! (Doubles over in pain.) What am 1going to do?



Sylvia. What's the matter, dear? (Catches on.) Oh. Are you having your ladies?
