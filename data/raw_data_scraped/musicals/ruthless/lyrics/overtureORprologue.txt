Overture/Prologue


[Sylvia St. Croiz]

(Spoken)

Talent!

Where does it come from?

My name is Sylvia St. Croix

Where does talent come from?

Is it?a?product of one's?environment, something you pick up off?the street?

Or is talent something you're born with, something passed down from generation to generation?

Something in the blood?

I wonder, meet Judy Denmark

Pretty, isn't she?

A wife and mother, leading an idyllic suburban life

And although Judy has absolutely no talent whatsoever, her only child, her daughter Tina, has been blessed with a great deal of talent
