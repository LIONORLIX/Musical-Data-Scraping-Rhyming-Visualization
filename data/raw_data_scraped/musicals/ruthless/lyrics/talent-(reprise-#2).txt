Talent (Reprise #2)


Sylvia.

You can go first class

If you've got talent

The world will kiss your ass

If you've got talent

Youâ€™ll have it all

Wait and see

And all of your talent

Came from - (collapses.)



Lita.

Ah, she never could sing.



Tina.

I can call the shots

Cause i got talent

The world is gonna plotz

From all this talent

And if you don't agree with this

Frankly i suggest you kiss

My adolescent

Prepubescent bum



Tina.

Hey, Hollywood

Here I come!

(Slowly... Lights fade.)
