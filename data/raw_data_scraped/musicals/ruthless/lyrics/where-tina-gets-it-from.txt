Where Tina Gets It From


SYLVIA.

What is there to say? You would think one’s own flesh and blood would have inherited at least a fraction of her mother’s talent.



JUDY.

Who's to say where talent comes from? Look at

Tina. After all...



I can’t sing a note

No talent whatsoever

I can’t tell a joke

Ym simply not that clever

Make no mistake,

With pride im overcome,

But i haven't a clue

As to who

Tina gets it from



SYLVIA.

Surely there's something you can do.



JUDY.

Let me think...

I CAN MAKE A BED.

AND FRICASSEE A CHICKEN,



SYLVIA.

You're brimming with talent.



JUDY.

My sweet onion spread

When spread on garlic bread

Is finger lickin’

But on a stage,

I simply would go numb

So I’m up in the air

As to where

Tina gets it from



SYLVIA.

Leave everything to me, dear

I've been around the block

As long as she makes millions

Who cares where Tina gets it from

Now, here's the way we play it

First we sign with agents

One in New York

One on the coast 					Judy.

She's great for a talk 					Hey!

Show 							Stop by for some

But only a couple 					Chicken

Overexposure is

All too common in the 				My...

Highly competitive 					Sweet onion spread



World

Where a professional 					When spread



Kid

Will make more money				On garlic bread

Than her parents 					Is finger lickin’

A star as bright as

She, dear... 						But on a stage

One brighter than the 					I simply would go

Sun  							Numb

Her fans everywhere					So I’m up in the air



Sylvia. 						Judy.

Simply won't care 					As to where my

Where

Tina gets it from 					Tina gets it from

No matter where she

Got it

Oh, who cares?

Your kid is gonna earn a lot



Sylvia & Judy.

It doesn't matter, no!

It matters not

Not a bit, not a crumb...
