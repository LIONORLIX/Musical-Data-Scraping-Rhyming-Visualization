Ruthless!


Ginger.

Remember the night

Won my first tony

Thanked my producers

Sonoco and sonny

I thanked my director

My hairdresser, Paul

I thanked all the people,

Both little and small

And assure you

The tears that i dabbed

Were not for the backs

That i stabbed

Be ruthless

Take a gander at me... Ruthless

Unconditionally... Ruthless

That's the game you must play

To hit the heights



Sylvia,

I guarantee ruthless

Puts you on the marquee...

Ruthless!

They're notoriously ruthless



Sylvia & Ginger.

Those who have a career, Dearie



Tina.

Being sweet and affectionate,

Only leads to rejection, it

Never wins you a tony award.



Ginger.

Lord you've helped me

Scratch my itch

To be famous and filthy rich



Sylvia.

Well look at you

My little Broadway bitch!



Ginger.

I'm flying high and adored!



Tina, Sylvia & Ginger.

We.. Ruthless,



Tina.

Granny, mommy and me... Ruthless



Tina, Sylvia & Ginger.

Take a tip from the three ruthless

Ladies singing this song

Can the compassion

The fashion is ruthless



Ginger.

Whether you're young



Tina.

Or gray-haired and toothless



Tina, Sylvia & Ginger.

The key to success is...



(Lita, Miss Thorn, and Eve, wearing Ginger's stained cocktail dress, dance on.)



All.

To be talented, yes!

Talent is swell,

But you gotta be fierce,

And ferocious as hell

Sharp as a tack,

Tough as a cop

Eager to claw your way

Straight to the top.

Ya can't stand the heat?

Get offa the bus!

You want to be famous?

Listen to us cause...

We... Ruthless

Look around and you'll see... Ruthless

Don’t you know that to be ruthless

In itself is an art?

So if you’re smart you'll

Can the compassion

The fashion is ruthless

Whether you're young

Or gray-haired and toothless:

The key to success is

Ruthlessness:



Ginger.

A low-cut dress might impress

But to get the gig

You gotta have big

Ruthlessness!



All,

The key to success...

Ruthless neh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-ess!
