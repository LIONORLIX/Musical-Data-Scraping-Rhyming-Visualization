The Pippi Song


Louise.

Howdy-do

My name is Pippi

P-i-p-p-y



Miss Thorn.

Stop! For the last time it’s spelled P I P P I.



Louise.

Oh.

Howdy-do

My name is Pippi

P-l-p-p-o!

I betcha think that I’m a fool,

Cause i don't go to school

So tm not smart, i'm not bright

That's okay, that's all good

Anyone as cute as me

Don't need a phd

In bora bora no one's bored.

This island's all the rage

It's full. O’ hula dancers,

And there's no stinkin’ drinkin’ age

Our adventure's just begun

And now that you all met me,

Meet my water gun



(Louise takes out a water pistol, squirts the audience twice.)



Miss Thorn.

The audience will love it! Makes them part of the show. Do it again!



Louise.

Our adventure's just begun

And now that you all met me

Meet my water gun
