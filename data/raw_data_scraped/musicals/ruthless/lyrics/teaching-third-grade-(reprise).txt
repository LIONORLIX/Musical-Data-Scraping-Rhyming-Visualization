Teaching Third Grade (Reprise)


I've altered the costume

Louise was so big



(Indicating Tina’s schoolbag.)



You'll have to come up with

A red-braided wig

Smile, Mrs. Denmark.

She's gonna be great

Good god, it’s twelve thirty

And the show starts at eight!



Look on the bright side - now you'll get comps! (Exits.)
