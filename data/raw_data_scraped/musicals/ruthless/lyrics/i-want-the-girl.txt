I Want the Girl


Sylvia.

You say that i can have anything

?hat I want?



Ginger. Name it.



Sylvia.

I want the girl.

You say you will pay any price?

May i be blunt?

I want the girl

Look around

Look what I’ve made here

I've done everything for you

Tm not cutting out

Till I’m paid, dear

So save your behaviour

It's much too abusive

Want the girl

And i want an exclusive,



Ginger.

I know this rotten business inside and ouwill not allow my child anywhere near it.



Sylvia.

Afraid of the competition?



Ginger.

Goodbye, Sylvia. (Exits.)



Sylvia.

She thinks that she can

Toss me aside

She's got her nerve

I’ll get the girl

So hopelessly wrapped up

In her life,



(Calls offstage:)



You don’t deserve

That precious girl!

True, her reviews may be glowing

The critics’ darling, they say

Well, darling your ego is showing

Today's hot tamale

Tomorrow grows colder

The future is here, dear.

Look over your shoulder

I'm gonna take her

And I’m gonna make her:

A bigger star

A brighter star than you!

Stand back!

She's hittin’ the heights:

That gorgeous face

Those golden curls

See a blazing theatre marquee

My name in lights...

I mean the girls

Ginger, a word of advice, dear

Don't lose your soul to success

Fame is a fool's paradise, dear

You are who you are

Although you win prizes

It wouldn't burn bridges

Life's full of surprises

Tina, I’ll be here

Tm waiting for you, dear

To finish what we

Started out to do

You wait and see

And all that i did

All that i do

Is for ginger and you

It isn't for me

Not for me

Not for me

For me!

For me!

Not for me!



(Ginger and Eve enter, clapping slowly.)

Ginger.

Are we done?

Sylvia.

We are.

Ginger.

Do we want to freshen up?

Sylvia.

We do.

Eve.

There's a gas station on the corner.
