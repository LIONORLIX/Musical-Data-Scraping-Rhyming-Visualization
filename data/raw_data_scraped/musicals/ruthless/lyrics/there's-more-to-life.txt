There's More To Life


Tina.

Once upon a time

All I wanted was to shine

Brighter than the stars

Up in the sky

Not so long ago

1was putting on a show,

The only stars were me, myself, and I

But now I have

A different point of view

Td love to share

All that i have learned with you

The applause is wonderful, i know

But you can't take the audience,

Home with you after the show



Ginger.

Well, not all of them, anyway.



Tina.

There's more to life

Than excessive success

Being hounded by press.

In a fancy new dress

When you appear.

At a film premiere

And do blow

It's healthier rolling in grass

Than rolling in dough

Stardom is but a fleeting reward

Today you're adored

Tomorrow ignored

But you can rely on the moon

And the moo of a cow

Milking its teat is much sweeter

Than milking a bow

To think all that mattered

Was being a star on the rise

When i opened my heart and my eyes

What a lovely surprise.

‘to realize I’m someone who cares

About saving the wombats and whales

And the kodiak bears



Ginger.

Tina, I have no idea what the hell you're talking about, but there is something missing in my life.



Tina.

I know, mother.



Ginger.

Do you? Really?



Tina.

Though you've lost your way

Please understand

You’re not alone, mother

Give me your hand.



(Ginger takes hold of Tina’s hand.)

I’m here



(Ginger holds both her hands.)



I've come home

Mother dear.

It's your chance to be
