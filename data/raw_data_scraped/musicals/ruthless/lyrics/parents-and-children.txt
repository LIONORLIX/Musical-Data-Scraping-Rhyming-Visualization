Parents And Children


Ginger.

You're not my only reason

To exist, dear

When i think of all the life

I might have missed, dear

Yes, I had a life

Before your birth, dear

You're not my only reason

To be living here on earth, dear

Being a mother

Is only a fraction

Even a mothers,

Entitled to action

Don't get me wrong, kid

I know the score

And I’ve done double-duty

Now i want more!

I fed you

I dressed you

You sneezed

And I god blessed you

Now I have a life,

Tm more than a mother!

More than a wife!



Tina.

Iam your kid

And there's no going back. Mom

Tm here and now

I think I’ll go unpack, mom,

Whatever I am, mom

I owe it to you

So you can't disregard me

And discard me on cue

Who cares if you agree

You’re shit outta luck, mom

You're stuck, mom, with me



Ginger.

Let's be calm

Let's not shout

Let's try and figure out

What this is really all about.



Ginger & Tina.

Who'd have thought?

We'd come to this position?

Mother, daughter

Locked in competition



Tina.

And all I want is...



Ginger.

All I’m saying...



Ginger & Tina.

All I hope for

All I’m praying.

Is for you to look at.



Ginger. 			Tina.

Me 				Look at...

Look at. 			Me

Me 				Look at...

Look at... 			Me

Me 				Look at.



Tina.

Me!



Ginger.

Me!



Tina.

Me!



Ginger.

Me!



Ginger & Tina.

Look at me!

Parents and children

So often like strangers

Compete for attention

Vie for respect

Parents and children

Acting like strangers

If you take a moment

To reflect, you'll see

Were no different

From any family



Tina.

You're my mother



Ginger.

You're my daughter



Together.

Look at me!
