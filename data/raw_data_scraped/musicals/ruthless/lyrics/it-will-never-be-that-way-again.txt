It Will Never Be That Way Again


Once life was simple,

And entres nous

I was an ordinary nothing



(to audience member.)



Just like you

A ho hum colorless routine,

My life of laundry and caffeine

I was a mother and a housewife,

Way back when,

It will never be that way again

I lost the apron

I found my voice

When you're born to entertain

You have no choice

As someone blessed with great success

I know I must not acquiesce

If tempted to indulge

A housewife yen

It will never be that way again



The truth is, last night - and this is strictly between us, i was lying in bed fighting an urge to defrost my freezer. (Beat.) There's more. I've had this crazy notion of giving up a sold-out matinee to sit alone and listen to the warm hum of a vacuum cleaner. (Finds hidden stash of lemon pledge.) Sometimes all i can think about is that sweet metallic screechy sound it makes when you set up an ironing board. (Sprays Pledge on surface.) Don't get me wrong. I'm not saying i want to iron. I don't! I can't! I'm a star! (Snorts pledge off surface.)



Now people love me

From hell to maine

All I want is all of you

And expensive champagne

Once long ago and far away

Before this broad was on Broadway

I had a broom, not just an ego.

Way back when

Now i star in Broadway shows

Cause in my veins the talent flows

This time Iâ€™m doing it for me, mama!

It will never be that way again!
