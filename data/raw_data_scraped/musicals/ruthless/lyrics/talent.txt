Talent


Sylvia.

Oh, any tyke can ride a bike

Any brat can swing a bat

Every mothers child plays with blocks

‘they run and skip and jump

And climb on rocks

That may be true for every dick and Jane

Ah, but some of us were born to entertain!



(to herself.) This time I’m doing it for you, baby!

(to Tina.) You can have it all

You've got talent

Life can be a ball

If you've got talent

When it’s obvious your child's not

An average ordinary tot

Shower her with love and validation

Judy, recognize her specialties

Her opportunity to seize.

The brass ring of success

Acclaim and adoration

(to Tina.) Come ‘ere. Do you like ice cream?



Tina.

You bet i do!



Sylvia.

It's all banana splits

When you've got talent

You don't have to show your tits

If you got talent!

You're no silly plastic ingénue,

In cheesy ads for cheap shampoo.

Darling, you're too good for television

Tm talking straight legit

I mean the Broadway stage,

The silver screen

But first we need your mother

To make the right decision...
