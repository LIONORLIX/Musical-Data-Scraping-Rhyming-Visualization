Day by Day (Part One)


[Officer 1]

(Spoken) Give us a Jew!



[Officer 2]

(Spoken)Be a good Frenchman!



[Officer 1]

(Spoken) Tell us what you know!



[Chorus]

Day by day, there is a time when men must choose.

Clear the land. Clean it at last!

Day by day, clean out the rabble and the Jews.

Root 'em out. Rub 'em out, fast!

Make them pay, punish the guilty for their crimes.

Make 'em all, make 'em all hurt!

Here we'll stay, taking advantage of the times.

Let 'em eat, let 'em eat dirt!
