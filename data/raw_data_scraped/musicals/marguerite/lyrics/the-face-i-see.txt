The Face I See


[Marguerite]

I've seen this face so many times,

Taking off my mask to end the day,

Yet tonight this seems a different face,

A face I had but somehow lost along the way,



The face I see

Is young once more.

He kissed me once,

And all at once I remembered

A time past remembering,

A time lost and longed for,

A time that was new.



He was in my arms for a moment,

One brief, endless moment.

He carried me back

To something I knew

Before there was you.



The face I see

I've seen before

We kissed just once

Now look at me,

I'm a schoolgirl!

I blush like a schoolgirl!

I drift in a daydream!

It's a whim, Marguerite,

Just a whim, let it go!

Any thought of him!



Long ago I turned away from this.

Love was just for fools, the young in years.

It starts in bliss.

It ends in tears.



If he stood behind the door now,

I'd be there, I would fall into his arms and now,

Wouldn't care! Maybe even start believing

That my life can begin once more.



The face I see

Has seen the world

A world gone mad

The hopes I had

That led me nowhere

The roads I've never taken

My dreams all forsaken

That never could be



Yet still I feel

His lips

His trace

And this face I see.
