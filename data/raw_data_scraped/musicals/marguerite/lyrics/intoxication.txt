Intoxication


[Armand]

This intoxication takes my breath away.

This agitation fevering the day.

I see her now at every turn.

Around every corner, she's there, she is waiting.

One moment inviting, one moment frustrating.

My imagination, fierce and running wild.

Infatuation, helpless as a child.

Can't tell the darkness from the light.

Or my left hand from my right.

Does my life begin with her?

Did my life begin that night?

She's a siren, she drowns me in her song.

She sings, she sings.

And the waters roar and rise.

And I am drowning, drowning...



This hallucination, crazy and obsessed.

This fascination will not let me rest.

She pressed her lips to mine and she

Intoxicated me...



[Marguerite]

This intoxication takes me by surprise.

This complcation fatally unwise.

Why should I throw it all aside?

The life that I lead, all the ease that it brings.

Where I have all I need at the snap of a finger...?



[Otto]

This intoxication robs me of my mind.

Humiliation never far behind...



[Marguerite]

What became of her? That pretty child?

Whose only dream was just to be a singer?

Why became of her? Did she run wild?

Did she run true? What did life bring her?

Poor girl...



[Otto]

Easily led and led astray...



[Marguerite]

Poor girl...



[Otto]

Lost her head and lost her way.

And today, she needs me more than ever...



[Marguerite]

I am drunk with him, my senses spin.

It's like my life is only just beginning...



[Marguerite and Armand]

This intoxication...



[Armand]

We are both the same, Marguerite and...



[Marguerite]

Armand is his name...



[Armand]

Marguerite and...



[Otto]

We are both to blame...
