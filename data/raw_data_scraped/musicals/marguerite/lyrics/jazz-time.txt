Jazz Time


[Annette]

Hit the floor and feel the beat



[Band]

Jazz Time!



[Annette]

Strike a match and feel the heat



[Band]

Jazz Time!



[Annette]

Come on, have a fling and stay up late,

Like the pretty girls of Bon Marche.

Come on, dance and sing and syncopate,

Gotta swing your little blues away!

It's Jazz Time!

It's Jazz Time!

Keep hopping til the morning sun!

It's Jazz Time!



[Band]

Jazz Time!



[Annette]

It's Jazz Time!



[Band]

Jazz Time!



[Annette]

No stopping til the dance is done!

You feel fine and fancy free?



[Band]

You got jazz!



[Annette]

You want fun and company?



[Band]

Now you have!



[Annette]

If your joie de vivre's not so hot,

Then a little jazz is all you need,

I've been up and down,

I know of what,

Satisfaction guarenteed!

It's Jazz Time!



[Band]

Jazz Time!



[Annette]

It's Jazz Time!



[Band]

Jazz Time!



Keep hopping til the morning sun!

It's Jazz Time!



[Band]

Jazz Time!



[Annette]

It's Jazz Time!



[Band]

Jazz Time!



[Annette]

No stopping til the dance is done!



[Musical interlude]



[All]

It's Jazz Time!

It's Jazz Time!

Keep hopping til the morning sun!

It's Jazz Time!

It's Jazz Time!

No stopping til the dance is done!

Jazz Time!
