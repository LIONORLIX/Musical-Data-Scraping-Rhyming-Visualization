My Heart Leaps Up


[Mack]

Ev'ry time a cop falls down my spirits soar

I'm in heaven when a flat foot hits the floor

Billy clubs and nightsticks make me feel

Happy as a new born pup

' Cause ev'ry time a cop falls down

My heart leaps up

Hit 'em on the head

[Kleiman & Fox]

Ha ha ha

[Mack]

Kick 'em in the shins

[Kleiman & Fox]

Ha ha ha

[Mack]

The heroine's behind

Is oh so ripe for bruising

Lash 'em in the loin

[Kleiman & Fox]

Ha ha ha

[Mack]

Grind 'em in the groin

[Kleiman & Fox]

Ha ha ha



[Mack]

Audiences find

That pain is so amusing

Everybody loves a little rabbit punching

Everybody loves the sound of knuckles crunching

So flatten someone's nose



[Kleiman & Fox]

Ha ha ha

[Mack]

Stub somebody's toes

[Kleiman & Fox]

Make a little thud

Draw a little blood

Hit 'em on the head

[Mack]

Mash 'em in the mouth

[Kleiman & Fox]

Ha ha ha



[Mack]

Jab 'em in the jaw

[Kleiman & Fox]

Ha ha ha

[Mack]

Give a violent shove

And make it realistic

Club 'em on the hip

[Kleiman & Fox]

Ho ho ho

[Mack]

Make a swollen lip

[Kleiman & Fox]

Ho ho ho

[Mack]

Audiences love to be a bit sadistic

[Mack, Kleiman & Fox]

People just adore

A fight that's death defying

Love it even more

When there are bullets flying

[Kleiman & Fox]

So thrash 'em in the thigh

[Mack]

Ha ha ha

[Kleiman & Fox]

Blacken someone's eye

[Mack]

Ha ha ha

[Kleiman & Fox]

Get 'em in the gut

[Mack]

Bruise 'em on the butt

[Mack, Kleiman & Fox]

Hit 'em on the head

Cut-out of station house with Kops pouring out of it starts on through following

Cause a little wreck

[Kleiman & Fox]

Ha ha ha

[Mack]

Break somebody's neck

[Kleiman & Fox]

Ha ha ha

[Mack]

Shoot a little gun

[Kleiman & Fox]

Yes folks, it's scintillating

[Mack]

Watch the fella feel

And slip on that banana peel

[Kleiman & Fox]

Ha ha ha

The public finds it fun

When it's excruciating

[All three]

Everybody loves to see policemen futile

In breaking up a brawl

That's been divinely brutal

[Mack]

So bite 'em in the calf



[Kleiman & Fox]

Ha ha ha

[Mack]

Listen to 'em laugh

[Kleiman & Fox]

Ha ha ha

[Mack]

Make a little slash

Make a wider gash

[All]

three Hit 'em on the head



[All]

People just adore a fight that's death-defying

Love it even more when there are bullets flying

So thrash 'em in the thigh

Ha ha ha

Blacken someone's eye

Ha ha ha

Get 'em in the gut

Bruise 'em on the butt

Make a little slash

Make a wider gash

Bite 'em on the calf

Listen to 'em laugh

Hit 'em on the head!
