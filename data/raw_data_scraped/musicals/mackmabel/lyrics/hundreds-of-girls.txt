Hundreds Of Girls


[Mack]

I'll fill the screen with Jan and Jane and Joan and Janet and Jean

I'll pull the greatest stunt this business has seen

Till ev'ry fella from Duluth to Atlanta sees

All of his fantasies!



One in the surf

Two on the shore

Maybe a dozen or

Twenty or more

I'll get hundreds and hundreds of girls

What gives a man

Power and punch

Tina for breakfast

And Lena for lunch

Having hundreds and hundreds of girls



Show him a blonde

And something in his soul will leap to respond

But then again he's also terribly fond

Of this brunette and so

Instead of one dandy dish

Pass him the candy dish

I'll sprinkle spice

Into his life

To make him forget

That he's stuck with his wife

Give him hundreds and hundreds of girls!



Beulah and Belle

Gladys and Gert

Two for the entree

And three for dessert

Give 'em hundreds and hundreds of girls

Four on a slide

Five on a swing

I'm gonna make

The cash register ring

Having hundreds and hundreds of girls



I'll fill the screen

With Jan and Jane and Joan and Janet and Jean

I'll pull the greatest stunt this business has seen

Till ev'ry fella from Duluth to Atlanta sees

All of his fantasies!

Look!



[Girls (Speaking)]

Hi Mack

How's it goin'?

It was great last night

Hi Honey

Let's play

Did I get the part

I'll see you later

See you tonight baby

Cute butt

Oh he's such a sweetie

Are you coming out.

All Kick! Kick!

Goodbye Mack,

He's so cute

See ya Mack

Bye honey.



The Bathing Beauties dance and then sing



[Girls]

What gives a man

Ginger and snap

Goin' through life

With his little ol' lap

Full of hundreds and hundreds of girls

What gives a man

Power and punch

Tina for breakfast

And Lena for lunch

Having hundreds and hundreds of girls

Analysts find

This thing called modern man

Was never designed

With only one eternal partner in mind

And so I gotta yell to

Hell with propriety

Viva variety

Sinner or saint

School girl or queen

One girl is boring and

Two are obscene

Give 'em hundreds and hundreds of girls



[All]

Beulah and Belle

Gladys and Gert

Two for the entree

And three for dessert

Give 'em hundreds and hundreds of girls!
