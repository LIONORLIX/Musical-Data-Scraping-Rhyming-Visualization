Look What Happened To Mabel


[Mabel]

Miss waitress from flatbush get down from up there

Don't you know that you're out of your class

Miss waitress from flatbush I hope you're aware

You're behaving like some little ass

Hey miss

What's this?...



See that fascinating creature

With perfection stamped on ev'ry feature

She was plain little nellie

The kid from the deli

But Mother of God, look what happened to Mabel!



From now on this pile of flesh'll

Be considered somethin' pretty special

And Miss B. L. T. Down

Is the toast of the town

Mary and Joseph, what happened to Mabel!



Ev'ry gesture and position that she takes

Is smart and meticulous

Talk about the magic that the camera makes

But this is ridiculous!



Hold your tongue and hold your snickers

For the new enchantress of the flickers

Is that plain little Nellie

The kid from the deli

So rattle me beads

Look what happened to Mabel!



Someone who was plain as mutton

On the screen is cuter than a button

And the girl with the pickles

Who hustled for nickels

Is somethin' to see. Look what happened to Mabel!



Yesterday a tip collector

But today just turn on that projector

And Miss Avenoo R

Is a regular star

Holy Mother Machree, look what happened to Mabel!

Up to now I really never knew that I

Could be so ambitious

But suddenly I know I have to say goodbye

To bagels and knishes



[Frank, Fatty & Andy]

Oh St. Aloysius



[Mabel]

I know that you might think I'm balmy

But the queen of the corned-beef and salami

Is a glamorous goddess

Who's bustin' her bodice

Oh! Jumpin' St Jude



[Frank, Fatty & Andy]

Look! Look! Look!

[Mabel]

Look what happened to Mabel!



[Grips & Actors]

See that fascinating creature

With perfection stamped on ev'ry feature

She was plain little Nellie

The kid from the deli

But Mother Of God look what happened To Mabel!

Someone who was plain as mutton

On the screen is cuter than a button

And the girl with the pickles

Who hustled for nickels

Is something to see. Look what happened to Mabel!

Every gesture and position that she takes

Is smart and meticulous

Talk about the magic that the camera makes

But this is ridiculous

[Mabel]

Hold your tongue and hold your snickers

For the new enchantress of the flickers

Is that plain little Nellie

[Men]

That plain little Nellie

[Mabel]

The kid from the deli

[Men]

The kid from the deli

[Mabel]

So rattle me beads

[Men]

Look! Look! Look!

[Mabel]

Look what happened to

All Mabel!
