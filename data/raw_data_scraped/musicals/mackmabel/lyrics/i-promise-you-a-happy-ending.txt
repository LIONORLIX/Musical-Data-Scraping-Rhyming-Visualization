I Promise You A Happy Ending


[Mack]



I promise you a happy ending

Like the ones that you see on the screen

So if you've had a bad beginning

Love will come out winning in the closing scene

And when you find it rough

Contending with the grind

That the world puts us through

I can promise you a happy ending

That has you, loving me, loving you



I promise you a happy ending

Like the one you've been dreaming about

Where vows are vowed and knots are knotted

And the preachers potted as the reel runs out

And so I'm strongly recommending

That you back up your old point of view

I can promise you a happy ending

That has you, loving me, loving you.
