Time Heals Everything


[Mabel]

Time heals everything

Tuesday

Thursday

Time heals everything

April

August

If I'm patient the break will mend

And one fine morning the hurt will end

So make the moments fly

Autumn

Winter

I'll forget you by

Next year

Some year

Tho' it's hell that I'm going through

Some Tuesday

Thursday

April

August

Autumn

Winter

Next year

Some year

Time heals everything

Time heals everything

But loving you.



So make the moments fly

Autumn

Winter

I'll forget you by

Next year

Some year

Though it's hell that I'm going through

Some Tuesday

Thursday

April August

Autumn winter

Next year

Some year

Time heals everything

Time heals everything

But loving you!
