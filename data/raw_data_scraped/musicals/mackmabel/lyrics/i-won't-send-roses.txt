I Won't Send Roses


[Mack]

I won't send roses

Or hold the door

I won't remember

Which dress you wore

My heart is too much in control

The lack of romance in my soul

Will turn you grey, kid

So stay away, kid

Forget my shoulder

When you're in need

Forgetting birthdays

Is guaranteed

And should I love you, you would be

The last to know

I won't send roses

And roses suit you so...



Mack My pace is frantic

My temper's cross

With words romantic

I'm at a loss

I'd be the first one to agree

That I'm preoccupied with me

And it's inbred, kid

So keep your head, kid

In me you'll find things

Like guts and nerve

But not the kind of things

That you deserve

And so while there's a fighting chance

Just turn and go

I won't send roses

And roses suit you so.
