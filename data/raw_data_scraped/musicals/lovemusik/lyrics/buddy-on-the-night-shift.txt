Buddy On The Night Shift


Hello there, buddy on the nightshift. I hope you slept all day

Until the moon came out and woke you up and sent you on your way.

Hello there, buddy on the nightshift. I hope you're feeling fine.

I left a lot of work for you to do on a long assembly line.

I wish I knew you better, but you never go my way,

For when one of us goes on the job, the other hits the hay.

Goodbye now, buddy on the nightshift, and push those planes along,

And when the sun comes out, I'll take your place, all wide awake and strong.

I'll follow you, you'll follow me, and how can we go wrong?
