It Never Was You


I've been running through rain

And the winds that follow after,

For one certain face,

And an unforgotten laughter

I've been looking for suns

I've been searching through the lands

For a certain pair of eyes

And a certain pair of lips.

Yes, I've looked everywhere

You can look without wings

And I've tried a great variety

Of interesting things.

But it never was you,

It never was any way you

An occasional sunset reminded me,

Or a flower hanging high on a tulip tree,

Or one red star hung low in the west,

Or a heartbreak call from a meadowlark's nest

Made me think for a moment.

Maybe it's true

I've found you in the star, in the call,

In the blue...

But it never was you,

It never was any way you
