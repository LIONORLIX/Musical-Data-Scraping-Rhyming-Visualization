Captain Jack


Saturday night and you're still hangin' around

You're tired of livin' in your one horse town

You'd like to find a little hole in the ground for a while



So you go to the village in your tie-dye jeans

And you stare at the junkies and the closet queens

It's like some pornographic magazine, and you smile



But Captain Jack will get you high tonight

And take you to your special island

Captain Jack will get you by tonight

Just a little push 'n' you'll be smilin'

Oh yeah, yeah



Your sister's gone out, she's on a date

And you just sit at home and masturbate

Your phone is gonna ring soon,

But you just can't wait, for that call



So you stand on the corner in your new English clothes

And you look so polished from your hair down to your toes

But still your fingers gonna pick your nose, after all



But Captain Jack will get you high tonight

And take you to your special island

Captain Jack will get you by tonight

Just a little push 'n' you'll be smilin'

Oh yeah, yeah



So you decide to take a holiday

You got your tape deck and your brand new Chevrolet

Ah, but there's no place to go anyway and what for

You've got everything, but nothin's cool

They just found your father in the swimming pool

And you guess you won't be going back to school anymore



But Captain Jack will get you high tonight

And take you to your special island

Captain Jack will get you by tonight

Just a little push 'n' you'll be smilin'

La da, da

Oh yeah, yeah



So you play your albums and you smoke your pot

And you meet your girlfriend in the parking lot

Oh, but still you're aching for the things you haven't got,

What went wrong



And if you can't understand why your world is so dead

And why you've got to keep in style and feed your head

Well, you're twenty one and still you mother makes your bed

And that's too long



But Captain Jack will get you high tonight

And take you to your special island

Captain Jack will get you by tonight

Just a little push 'n' you'll be smilin'

Yeah, Captain Jack will get you by tonight

Yeah, Captain Jack will get you by tonight
