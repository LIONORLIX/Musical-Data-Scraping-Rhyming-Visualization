Scenes from an Italian Restaurant


A bottle of white, a bottle of red

Perhaps a bottle of rose instead

We'll get a table near the street

In our old familiar place

You and I--face to face



A bottle of red, a bottle of white

It all depends on your appetite

I'll meet you any time you want

In our Italian Restaurant.



Things are okay with me these days

Got a good job, got a good office

Got a new wife, got a new life

And the family's fine

We lost touch long ago

You lost weight

I did not know

You could ever look so good after

So much time.



I remember those days hanging out

At the village green

Engineer boots, leather jackets

And tight blue jeans

Drop a dime in the box play the

Song about New Orleans

Cold beer, hot lights

My sweet romantic teenage nights



Brenda and Eddie were the popular steadies

And the king and the queen of the prom

Riding around with the car top down and the radio on

Nobody looked any finer

Or was more of a hit at the Parkway Diner

We never knew we could want more than that out of life

Surely Brenda and Eddie would always know how to survive.



Brenda and Eddie were still going steady in the summer of '75

When they decided the marriage would be at the end of July

Everyone said they were crazy

"Brenda you know you're much too lazy

Eddie could never afford to live that kind of life."

But there we were wavin' Brenda and Eddie goodbye.



They got an apartment with deep pile carpet

And a couple of paintings from Sears

A big waterbed that they bought with the bread

They had saved for a couple of years

They started to fight when the money got tight

And they just didn't count on the tears.



They lived for a while in a very nice style

But it's always the same in the end

They got a divorce as a matter of course

And they parted the closest of friends

Then the king and the queen went back to the green

But you can never go back there again.



Brenda and Eddie had had it already

By the summer of '75

From the high to the low

To the end of the show

For the rest of their lives

They couldn't go back to the greasers

The best they could do was pick up the pieces

We always knew they would both find a way to get by

That's all I heard about Brenda and Eddie

Can't tell you more than I told you already

And here we are wavin' Brenda and Eddie goodbye.



A bottle of red, and bottle of white

Whatever kind of mood you're in tonight

I'll meet you anytime you want

In our Italian Restaurant.
