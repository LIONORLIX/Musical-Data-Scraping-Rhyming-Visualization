Be Kind To Your Parents


Be kind to your parents,

though they don't deserve it,

remember they're grownups

a difficult stage of life.



They're apt to be nervous and overexcited

Confused by their daily storm and strife.



Just keep in mind, though it sounds odd I know,

Most parents once were children long ago

(Incredible).



So treat then with patience and sweet understanding,

in spite of the foolish things they do.20

One day you may wake up and find you're a parent, too.
