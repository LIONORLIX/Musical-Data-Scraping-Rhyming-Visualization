Chanson


CHAQUE JOUR EST UN JOUR

COMME LES AUTRES DOUX JOURS

LE POTAGE, L'OUVRAGE

PEUT-ETRE L'AMOUR

LE SOLEIL, IL VOYAGE

LE MONDE FAIT UN TOUR

AINSI CEST TOUJOURS LE MEME ...



EVERY DAY AS YOU DO WHAT YOU DO EVERY DAY

YOU SEE THE SAME FACES WHO FILL THE CAFE

AND IF SOME OF THOSE FACES HAVE NEW THINGS TO SAY

NOTHING IS REALLY DIFFERENT...



AND THE SHEEP DOT THE HILL WHERE THE OLIVE TREE SWAYS

AND THE WORLD SPINS AROUND WITH THE GREENS AND THE GRAYS

AND YOU NEVER TAKE TIME OUT TO THINK OF THE WAYS

EVERYTHING MIGHT BE DIFFERENT...





AND THEN ONE DAY, SUDDENLY, SOMETHING CAN HAPPEN,

IT MAY BE QUITE SIMPLE, IT MAY BE QUITE SMALL

BUT ALL OF A SUDDEN YOUR STEW TASTES DIFFERENT

AND YOU HEAR THE GULL CRY IN A DIFFERENT KEY,

AND YOU SEE WITH NEW EYES,

AND THE FACES YOU SEE

ARE PEOPLE YOU DON'T KNOW AT ALL...



AND THE SOMEONE WHO TOUCHES YOUR HAIR EVERY DAY,

TOUCHES YOU NOW IN A DIFFERENT WAY,

AND YOU MAY WANT TO RUN OR YOU MAY WANT TO STAY

FOREVER

AND SINCE LIFE IS THE CRY OF THE GULL

AND THE TASTE OF YOUR STEW

AND THE WAY THAT YOU FEEL

WHEN HE TOUCHES YOU

NOW YOUR WHOLE LIFE IS DIFFERENT

NOW YOUR WHOLE LIFE IS NEW...



LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA

LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA



EVERY DAY AS YOU DO WHAT YOU DO EVERY DAY

YOU SEE THE SAME FACES WHO FILL THE CAFE

AND IF SOME OF THOSE FACES HAVE NEW THINGS TO SAY

NOTHING IS REALLY DIFFERENT.



Reprise:



AND SINCE LIFE IS THE CRY OF THE GULL

AND THE TASTE OF YOUR STEW

AND THE WAY THAT YOU FEEL

WHEN HE TOUCHES YOU

NOW YOUR WHOLE LIFE IS DIFFERENT

NOW YOUR WHOLE LIFE IS NEW...
