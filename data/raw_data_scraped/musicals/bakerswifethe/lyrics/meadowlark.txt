Meadowlark


What does he think i am?

What sort of a weak-willed sentimental sheep

Does he think i am?

Well, i won't even think about him,

I'll just go to sleep! ...



Who does he think he is?

Who could be as handsome

Who could be as smart as he thinks he is?

He just has to snap his fingers

Women fall apart!

What does he think

That i'll slink away with him?

That i'll follow him ripe and drooling?

Who does he think he is?

And what does he think i am?

And who do i think ...



(sighs)



I'm fooling?



When i was a girl l i had a favorite story

Of the meadowlark who lived where the rivers wind

Her voice could match the angels' in its glory

But she was blind, the lark was blind

An old king came and took her to his palace

Where the walls were burnished bronze and golden braid

And he fed her fruit and nuts from an ivory chalice

And he prayed:



"sing for me, my meadowlark,

Sing for me of the silver morning,

Set me free, my meadowlark,

And i'll buy you a priceless jewel

And cloth of brocade and crewel

And i'll love you for life,

If you will sing for me."



Then one day as the lark sang by the water

The god of the sun heard her in his flight

And her singing moved him so

He came and brought her the gift of sight

He gave her sight

And she opened her eyes to the shimmer and the splendor

Of this beautiful, young god, so proud and strong

And he called to the lark in a voice both rough and tender

"come along.

Fly with me, my meadowlark,

Fly with me on the silver morning,

Past the sea where the dolphins bark

We will dance on the coral beaches,

Make a feast of the plums and peaches

Just as far as your vision reaches

Fly with me."



But the meadowlark said no

For the old king loved her so

She couldn't bear to wound his pride

So the sun god flew away

And when the king came down that day

He found his meadowlark had died

Every time i heard that part i cried ...



And now i stand here starry-eyed and stormy

Oh, just when i thought my heart was finally numb

A beautiful, young man appears before me,

Singing "come, oh, won't you come?"

And what can i do if finally for the first time

The one i'm burning for returns the glow?

If love has come at last it's picked the worst time

Still i know

I've got to go





Fly away, meadowlark

Fly away in the silver morning,

If i stay, i'll grow to curse the dark

So it's off where the days won't bind me

I know i leave wounds behind me

But i won't let tomorrow find me

Back this way

Before my past once again can blind me

Fly away ...

And we won't wait

To say good-bye

My beautiful young man

And i.
