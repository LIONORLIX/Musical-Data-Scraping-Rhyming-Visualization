One Moment


NIKKI

Don't waste your time on me

There's nothing anyone can do to set me free?



One life

One fate

Nothing I can do

God knows I've whipped my tears away

Too long

Too late

And everything I ever had

Was broken on that day



One moment and life is changed forever

Paths are crossed

Dreams are lost

Destinies collide

In one moment the world is changed forever

The great and good divide

Truth will decide



One choice

One fight

What else can I do?

How could I live and let it be?

Two wrongs

One right

And either way a price to pay

That all comes back to me



One moment you face the world together

Riding high

Days go by

Lost without a care

One last moment of holding on together

As all the dreams you share

Melt into air



And life plays on

Beyond those gates

Where freedom calls

And no one waits

There where my life used to be

There's nothing but a fantasy

All that I had left of me

Is gone

All gone

Long gone



I won' regret

I don't regret

There's nothing more that I can say

I'll pay my debt

And let them throw my life away



One moment your future's gone forever

Bridges burned

A corner burned

You walk the line alone

In one moment what's done is done forever

When all the birds have flown

You're on your own

You're on your own

I'm on my own.
