I Shouldn't Be Here


SHELL

Shell Dockley. Lifer. Murder.

Well ? just a bit of torture, really. Didn?t expect

The dozy twat to go and die on me. Pathetic!



But no one messes with my man

And gets away with their face intact

It?s an obvious fact

I was bound to react

That Double D cup slapper

Was gonna get whacked

I shouldn?t be here?



CRYSTAL

Crystal Gordon. Twelve months. Shoplifting.

But the good book says the Lord helps them

Who helps themselves.



All them shops go flaunting

Their goods in your face

It?s asking for grief, man

In the circumstance of my case

It?s my beliefthat

I was doing it for Jesus

I was doing it for Jesus

Like he did in the temple story

For the Lord God?s greater glory

But instead of chucking it down off the shelf

I stuffed it in my rucksack

And kept it for myself

I shouldn?t be here?



DENNY

Denny Blood. Seven years. Arson. It was

A rubbish kids? home anyway!



I wanted a life

I wanted a mum

They said if you?re good, Den

Maybe one day she might come

So I wait

And I wait

And I start to think they must think

I?m really dumb

Cos she weren?t never, ever gonna come

So I poured petrol all around their kitchen floor

Threw in a match and slammed the door

And now I don?t wait for no one anymore



JULIE S

Julie Saunders.



JULIE J

Julie Johnston.



JULIE S

Two years.



JULIE J

Two years.



JULIE S

Soliciting.



JULIE J

And thieving?



TWO JULIES

Together.



The oldest profession in the book

Combined

With a sideline in the wallets

That we took



JULIE S

Don?t you find these day

It?s all for the school fees

And not for the fun



TWO JULIES

You have to plan ahead now

For every little one



JULIE S

For choices parental



JULIE J

Dosh is fundamental



JULIE S

That?s how my troubles first begun



JULIE J

Gonna get our kids back one day?



JULIE S

But I thought I owed it to my son



TWO JULIES

I shouldn?t be here?



NIKKI

Nikki Wade. Lifer. ?Cop-Killer?. But hey, at least

That?s the one less rapist in the world.



Nobody?s hero

Somebody?s fool

Don?t go mistaking me for

Somebody who?ll ?

Ever give a damn

For what they think I am

I shouldn?t be here

I don?t wanna be here?

But here I am



PRISONERS

Here I am

Here I am

Here I am

And one thing is clear

One thing is clear

When I take a good look around me

I shouldn?t be here?



I shouldn?t be here

I don?t wanna be here

I shouldn?t be here

This is not my life!

Give back my life!



I had plans

I had dreams

My life is not the three-car-wreck it seems

I know it may not be much

But I was someone

Someone?s sister, daughter, mother

Just a girl like any other

So maybe I?m out of touch

But still I?m someone



And when they slam that door every night

And I?m alone in my bed

I escape where it?s safe out of sight

To the world that I keep in my head

That?s where I hide myself

Out of reach from the screws



TWO JULIES

On a beach ? with our kids ?

Kicking sand from our shoes





NIKKI

There?s a bar ?



CRYSTAL

There?s a bar where I?m singing the blues



SHELL & DENNY

Getting wasted on cheap foreign booze



PRISONERS

I can go where I choose?

I?ve got nothing to lose?



JIM

Right, you lot. Breakfast. Move it!



SYLVIA

(To the JULIES) You two ? serve out the swill.

The rest of you ? line up at your through.



PRISONERS

I shouldn?t be here

This isn?t me ere

This is not my life!



SYLVIA

Move it!



PRISONERS

Give me back my life!



JIM

Shut it! Chocs away, Sylv.

Here comes Miss New Broom.



SYLVIA

Flaming Nora. Why can?t she stay in her office Like any normal Wing Governor?



JIM

One day they?ll pick the right man for the job.



HELEN

Maybe I?m a fool to think

That I could do some good

But if I didn?t think I could

I wouldn?t be here

Now I have a chance to really do this

My own way

I won?t  let anyone say

I shouldn?t be here



SHELL

Don?t worry Rachel. We?ll help you cope

Without your drugs, won?t we Den?



DENNY

Yeah. ?Cos either you give them over to Shell,

Or I?ll smack your head open.



NIKKI

Oi! Leave the kid alone, Dockley.



SHELL

Why? Fancy her yourself?



PRISONERS

Same old shit 24/7



JULIES

Welcome to life here inside



PRISONERS

This is it



CRYSTAL

And it sure isn?t heaven



NIKKI

Although it feels like I?ve died



PRISONERS

When you need a helping hand

Don?t expect them to understand

What?s another day?

Another week?

Another year?

When we shouldn?t be here

We shouldn?t be here

We shouldn?t be here.
