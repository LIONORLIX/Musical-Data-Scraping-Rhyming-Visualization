JIM

You won’t learn this art in a book

There’s no fast track to it



SYLVIA

You can’t skip the years that it took

There’s a real knack to it



JIM

Jailcraft

We’ve got it



SYLVIA

Jailcraft

You’ve got it



JIM / SYLVIA

Jailcraft

That’s what it takes



SYLVIA

You won’t get this with a degree

In criminal justice



JIM

Down the sharp end, take it from me

The one thing you trust is



JIM / SYLVIA

Jailcraft

We’ve got it

Hard graft

But we’ve got it

Jailcraft

That’s what it takes



JIM

It’s basic common sense



SYLVIA

Plus a little self-defense



JIM

Mix with professional calm



SYLVIA

Add a dash of personal charm



JIM / SYLVIA

And when that old proverbial

Finally hits the fan

We’re up front

Bearing the brunt

Just doing the best we can



We don’t get the thanks we deserve

Down at the coalface

While those wimps are losing their nerve

We run the whole place

Jailcraft



JIM

Irrefutable



JIM / SYLVIA

Jailcraft



SYLVIA

God we’re beautiful



JIM / SYLVIA

Jailcraft

That’s what it takes



JIM

And if the powers that be

Are just too blind to see

I know a thing or two

I’ll pull a string or two

Take a lesson from me



NUMBER ONE

So Jim, off the record, how’s the new girl Governor doing on G Wing’



JIM (aside)

Worried look, furrowed brow

A slight’ hesitation’



NUMBER ONE

If you have concerns’



JIM (to NUMBER ONE)

I wouldn’t like to interfere



NUMBER ONE

Any information is in the strictest confidence



JIM

It’s all in here’

(JIM hands over a notebook)

Years of experience

You understand’



NUMBER ONE

Leave it with me, Jim. Enough said.



JIM

Years of perfecting

A shake of the hand



NUMBER ONE

See you at the Lodge meeting’



JIM

My but it’s good taking control

Sliding up that greasy pole



JIM / SYLVIA

And you won’t get that out a book

On prison procedure

When those suits get caught on the hook

That’s when they need ya

Jailcraft

We’ve got it

He’s daft

But we’ve got it

Jailcraft

That’s what it takes

When you’re short-staffed

Your back nearly breaks

We get well shafted

But we struggle through

Keep your eye on the ball

Your ear to the ground

Back to the wall

When trouble’s around

It’s Jailcraft



JIM

Jailcraft



SYLVIA

Jailcraft



JIM / SYLVIA

That’s what we do

Me and you!
