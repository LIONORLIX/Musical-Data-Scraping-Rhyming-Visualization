This Is My Life


NIKKI

I?m gonna be there

That?s a promise I won?t break



HELEN

I?m gonna be there

Watching over every move you make



NIKKI

This is my life

I?m living it



HELEN

This is your life

Keep giving it

Everything you can ?



NIKKI & HELEN

And I?m gonna be there?



NIKKI

All our tomorrows start today

Gotta throw those fears and doubts away

?Cos nobody tells you who you are



YVONNE

The past can?t hurt us now it?s gone

This is the time for moving on

Don?t hold back now we?ve come so far



NIKKI

And we all know just how hard it can be

When you?re facing that ten foot wall

But if you all stand together with me

We?re gonna see it fall



I?m gonna be there



PRISONERS

I?m gonna be there



NIKKI

I will be the first in line

I?m gonna be there



PRISONERS

I?m gonna be there



NIKKI

I?m going out and taking back what?s mine



ALL

This is my life

I?m living it

This is my life

I?m giving it

Everything I can ?

To make it good



I have plans and I have dreams

Though maybe some of them are just crazy schemes

But still

I wanna try

To be someone

Just give me a chance and I?m gonna take it

To escape from the cycle and break it

I wanna show them why

I am someone



And when I make it out of this place

From the moment I walk through that door

Whatever shit life throws in my face

I am not gonna take it any more

I?m heading on my way to where I want to be



On a beach with our kids

Kicking sand from our shoes

There?s a bar (2x)

Where I?m singing the blues

Getting wasted on cheap foreign booze

But if that is the life that I chose

If that is the life that I chose

I?m gonna be there

I?ve gotta be there

I?m gonna be there

I wanna be there
