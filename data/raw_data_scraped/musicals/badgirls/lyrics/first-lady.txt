First Lady


SHELL

I need a man with his hand on the wheel

Who has the power to go far



You need a woman who?ll show you the way to reveal

What kind of man you truly are



It?s just the two of us with no one else to see

So why not start revealing yourself to me?



I?ll be your?

First Lady of the Night

Won?t you come out and play

I?m taking you all the way

If you can go the distance

I?ll offer no resistance

You know we?ve always been so right

I?m your First Lady of the Night



JIM

But let?s not forget, love, that a man needs his space

To come and go as he may please



SHELL

Don?t you worry about that, Jim.

You can be sure that a woman like me knows her place

I?ll be here waiting on my knees



BOTH

And you have no idea what treats you have in store

I?m gonna have you like you?ve never been had before



SHELL

I?ll be your



BOTH

First Lady of the Night

Turn all lights down low

We?re in for an all night show

Just give in to temptation

?Cos in this situation

You can?t deny it feels so right

I?m your / You?re my

First Lady of the Night



You really rock me off my feet

Maybe it?s meant to be

Together we could have this whole world in our hands

Baby, we?re turning up the heat

This is your destiny

You and me

We got something no one understands



First Lady of the Night

Turn all the lights down low

We?re in for an all night show

Just give in to temptation

?Cos in this situation

You can?t deny it feels so right

I?m your / You?re my

First Lady



JIM

First Lady ?



SHELL

And only



BOTH

First Lady of the Night
