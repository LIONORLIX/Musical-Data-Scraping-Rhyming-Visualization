The Future Is Bright


JIM

No stoping us now, Sylv.

We are going to show them how a prison really should be run.



?Cos if the powers that be

In all their wisdom agree

No other candidate

Can swing that gate like me?



OFFICERS

The future is bright again

The world is black and white again

We?re key happy, toe-tappy

Never thought that we?d be - so happy

One of our boys has made it

Shining like a star

Staking his claim

Making his name

Jim you will go far



JIM

The future is mine again

I?m swinging from a vine again

Lord and master of a new day

Hold on fast

We?re on the runway

Here at last

And I?ll be here to stay



OFFICERS

Your loyal army salutes you, Sir.



SYLVIA

I must say, that suit really suits you, Sir.



JIM

Come in

Pull a seat up

Put your feet up

This is how it?s gonna be

The witch is gone

And from now on

The man of the moment is me

Now it?s cream cakes without warning



SYLVIA

Tea breaks that last all morning



JIM & SYLVIA

No, it?s not a dream

But the start of our new regime



OFFICERS

It? looking good - It? looking good

It? looking great - It? looking great

We?re getting rid - We?re getting rid

We couldn?t wait - We couldn?t wait

Let?s go ? We?re on our way now

We know ? He?s here to stay now

Hey Ho ? Everything is gonna be OK now



One of our boys has made it

No one else could compare

Holding the flame

Playing the game

Who said we?d play fair?



The deed is done - The deed is done

It?s in the bag - It?s in the bag

The battle?s won - The battle?s won

Put up the flag - Put up the flag

We?re gonna spread a little happiness all over the place

Locking up the losers with a smile on our face

Nothing?s gonna stop us now we?re back on the case

And now

Jim look who?s the big cheese now!



OFFICERS

It? looking good - It? looking good

It? looking great - It? looking great

We?re getting rid - We?re getting rid

We couldn?t wait - We couldn?t wait

Let?s go ? We?re on our way now

We know ? He?s here to stay now

Hey Ho ? Everything is gonna be OK now



JIM

The future is bright again

The world is banged to right again

I?m key happy, toe-tappy

Never thought that I?d be - so happy



OFFICERS

One of our boys has made it

No one else could compare

Holding the flame

Playing the game

Who said we?d play fair?



JIM

Here I stand

With all the world at my feet

Just like I always planned

Victory is sweet



OFFICERS

The deed is done - The deed is done

It?s in the bag - It?s in the bag

The battle?s won - The battle?s won

Put up the flag - Put up the flag

We?re gonna spread a little happiness all over the place

Locking up the losers with a smile on our face

Nothing?s gonna stop us now we?re back on the case

Today



JIM

The future is mine again

I?m swinging from a vine again

Lord and master of a new day

Hold on fast

We?re on the runway

Here at last

And I?ll be here to stay

For the glorious



OFFICERS

Unmistakable



JIM

Victorious



OFFICERS

Still unbreakable



JIM & OFFICERS

P ? O ? A!
