The Baddest and the Best


NIKKI

You?d better wise up

To the way this is going down

For once in your life use your brain



DENNY

Like a bad dream

That keeps on coming round

He?s gonna screw you over again



PRISONERS & JUSTIN

And you?ll be history before you know what?s hit

Girl, you need a wake up call and this is it



YVONNE

So you better listen up

?Cos we?re all gonna beat this rap



JUSTIN

If he?s out to get you ? get him first!



YVONNE

We need a queen bee



TWO JULIES

Sitting in honey trap



NIKKI

Sharpen up your sting and do your worst



PRISONERS & JUSTIN

And he?ll be history before the day is through

So make your mind up now, it?s up to you!



DENNY

Do you wanna be bad?



PRISONERS & JUSTIN

Do you wanna be bad?



DENNY

Do you wanna be the baddest and the best?



PRISONERS & JUSTIN

You?ve been messed around and trampled down

Get it off your chest



NIKKI

No, you don?t get mad



PRISONERS & JUSTIN

You don?t get mad



NIKKI

You just get badder than all the rest

No one else could take that crown

You?re the baddest and the best



PRISONERS & JUSTIN

The baddest

The baddest

The baddest and the best



SHELL

Well it?s obvious I?m the best, innit?



NIKKI

So? Are you in with us?



YVONNE

Or just out for yourself?



DENNY

Go on, Shell?



PRISONERS & JUSTIN

The baddest

The baddest

The baddest and the best



SHELL

Yeah, all right. You know what Den?

I could get used to this solidary shit.



NIKKI

Right, everyone? Let?s get to work.



YVONNE (on the phone)

Hello Charlie, yeah it?s me. Do us a favour, darling?

I need a state of the art wireless minicam and receiver unit,

some extra-long-length line-out cable, a couple of male to female adapters to link it to the

main security system, and like yesterday, yeah?



(a parcel flies over the wall and Justin catches it)



YVONNE

Thanks, Charlie. (to the others) Impressed?



If you?re gonna be bad



PRISONERS & JUSTIN

If you?re gonna be bad



YVONNE

You gotta get the baddest and the best

No matter where you go it?s who you know

Put it to the test

No you don?t get mad



PRISONERS & JUSTIN

You don?t get mad



YVONNE

You just get badder than all the rest

Hit him hard and hit him low

Do your baddest and your best!



CR YSTAL

And I?m sure the Lord will understand

If we has to be a little bit underhand

When you?re out to smile the devil

You gotta sink down to his level



TWO JULIES

We?ll fix you up to look so nice

He won?t think twice

Before he makes his move

It?s an easy case to prove



JUSTIN

And when it?s up there on that screen

When the truth is finally seen?



DENNY

You?re gonna be a TV star

And the whole world?s gonna know who you are

You?ll be the best there?s ever been



SHELL

Now that bad, bad man is gonna rot in hell



DENNY

He?s going rot away in hell



SHELL

I?ll make him wish we?d never met



DENNY

He?s gonna wish he never ever met you



SHELL

?Cos I?m in the mood



DENNY

In the mood



SHELL

For a goodnight kiss and tell



DENNY

For a goodnight kiss and tell



SHELL

This?ll be the face he won?t forget



DENNY

He ain?t never ever gonna forget you



SHELL & DENNY

And he?ll be history before the day is done

We may be crazy but revenge is fun



If you?re gonna be bad



PRISONERS & JUSTIN

If you?re gonna be bad



SHELL & DENNY

You gotta be the baddest and the best



ALL

Don?t get messed around and trampled down

Get it off your chest



SHELL & DENNY

No you don?t get mad



PRISONERS & JUSTIN

You don?t get mad



ALL

You just get badder than all the rest



SHELL

Who?s the baddest girl in town?



PRISONERS & JUSTIN

The baddest, the baddest

The baddest and the best

The baddest, the baddest

The baddest of the baddest

And the baddest of the best!
