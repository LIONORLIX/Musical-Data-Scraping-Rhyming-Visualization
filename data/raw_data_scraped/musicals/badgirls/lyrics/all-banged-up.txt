All Banged Up


YVONNE & JULIES

We?re all banged up without the bang

We?ve got the go but there?s no fan dang

How?s any girl meant to do her thang

When she?s all banged up alone?



We?re all banged up without the bang



JULIE S

This little chassis needs a full front prang



JULIE J

I?m like a vampire without a fang



YVONNE & JULIES

And we?re all vamped up alone



And though we try not to think about

All the pleasures we miss

There?s bugger all else to think about

When you?re dumped in a hellhole like this



Day after day after day

These assets are wasting away



We?re all banged up without the bang

We get the twinges but where?s our twang?

Whipped to a peak like a stiff meringue

But we?re all whipped up alone



TWO JULIES

Bang! Bang!

Bang!

Bang!

Bang!

Bang!

Bang!



YVONNE

I want to feel the weight

Of a handsome hunk

Lying on top of me in my bunk

And when the lights go down, so does he

?Til everything goes ting-a-ling inside of me



Don?t want to fall in love, I don?t expect romance

I just want some action inside my pants

I never thought desire could be so strong

I never thought I?d ever have to go so long



JULIES

It?s just



YVONNE

It?s just



JULIES

A little thrust



YVONNE

A little trust



YVONNE & JULIES

It must be the least you can do



JULIES

You?re a screw



YVONNE

You?re a screw



JULIES

We can trust



YVONNE

We can trust



YVONNE & JULIES

And our welfare is all down to you



Night after night after night

Think of our desperate plight



JUSTIN

You really should try and eat something



YVONNE & JULIES

We?re all banged up without the bang

We?ve got the go but there?s no fan dang

How?s any girl meant to do her thang

When she?s all banged up alone?



We?re all banged up without the bang

Nobody wants to be in our gang

We couldn?t care less

If spring just sprang

If the queen just rang

They can all go hang

?Cos until we get out

And get out with a bang!

We?re all banged up

We?re all banged up

We?re all banged up

Alone
