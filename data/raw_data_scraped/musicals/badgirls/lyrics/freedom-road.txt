Freedom Road


CRYSTAL

Freedom road

Lead me home

I have traveled so long



Now my journey is through

I will come home to you

All my troubles are gone



Freedom road

Lead me home

I have traveled so long



When I lay me to rest

My soul will be blessed

All my troubles are gone



Freedom road

Lead me home

Oh!



Take me out of this darkness

Oh!

Let your light shine on me!

Free--dom road

I have traveled so long



Now my heart feels no pain

I will see you again

All my troubles are gone

All my troubles are gone



Freedom road

Lead me home
