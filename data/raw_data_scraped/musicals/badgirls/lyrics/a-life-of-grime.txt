A Life of Grime


JULIE J

When you?re stuck in the muck

And nobody gives a ?



TWO JULIES

French Connection



JULIE J

When you?re down on your luck

And you?re running in the ?



TWO JULIES

Wrong direction

There?s no escaping from the slime

You?re living a life of grime



JULIE J

Bloody rubbish!



TWO JULIES

A life of grime



JULIE J

When you doss with the dross

And you?re banged up in an ?



TWO JULIES

Institution



JULIE S

No-one?s giving a toss

All they?re giving you is ?



TWO JULIES

Retribution

You?re just a victim doing time

For living a life of grime



JULIE J

Bloody rubbish!



TWO JULIES

A life of grime



JULIE S

When you?re flat on your back

While some git gets his rocks off



TWO JULIES

That?s a time to reflect



JULIE J

You?re moaning and groaning

Your poor little socks off



TWO JULIES

That doesn?t get you respect

After blowing his hornpipe

And banging his drum

And thanking God you?re not his wife

It takes more than a wet wipe

To clean up the scum

Of your whole stinking miserable life



JULIE J

You?re a slut in a rut



JULIE S

Never shifting the dirt



JULIE J

Always looking for some lubrication



JULIE S

Sick and tired of the smut



JULIE J

Sick of lifting your skirt



JULIE S

You could use a bit of cultivation



TWO JULIES

Instead of blooming in your prime

You?re living a life of?



OTHER PRISONERS

Grime, grime, grime, grime

Can?t shift it, can?t move it

Can?t get this crap out of my life

Low down dirty little scumback scrubblers



JULIE S

All that I wanted was one lousy break

A chance to make everything right

But despite all my talents

The books never balance

I keep ending up in the shite



TWO JULIES

When you?re stuck in the muck

And nobody gives a French Connection

Always passing the buck

But you?re never gonna pass inspection

Now let me tell you one more time?



If cleanliness means godliness

We?re screwed already so sod the mess

The slop?s in the bucket

You don?t have to suck it

To see that it?s a crime

Living a life

Living a life

Living a life of grime.
