Come out, come out, wherever you are and meet the young lady, who fell from a star.

She fell from the sky, she fell very far and Kansas, she says, is the name of the star.

Munchkins

Kansas, she says, is the name of the star.

Glinda

She brings you good news. Or haven't you heard?

When she fell out of Kansas

A miracle occurred.

Dorothy

It really was no miracle. What happened was just this.

The wind began to switch - the house to pitch and suddenly the hinges started to unhitch.

Just then the Witch - to satisfy an itch went flying on her broomstick, thumbing for a hitch.

Munchkins

And oh, what happened then was rich.

*The house began to pitch. The kitchen took a slitch.

It landed on the Wicked Witch in the middle of a ditch,

Which was not a healthy situation for the Wicked Witch.

... Who began to twitch and was reduced to just a stitch of what was once the Wicked Witch.

Munchkin #1

We thank you very sweetly, for doing it so neatly.

Munchkin #2

You've killed her so completely, that we thank you very sweetly.

Glinda

Let the joyous news be spread, The Wicked Old Witch at last is dead!
