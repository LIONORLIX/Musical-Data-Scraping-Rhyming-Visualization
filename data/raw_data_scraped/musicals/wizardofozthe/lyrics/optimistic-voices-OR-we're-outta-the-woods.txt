Optimistic Voices / We're Outta The Woods


You're out of the woods

You're out of the dark

You're out of the night

Step into the sun

Step into the light



Keep straight ahead for the most glorious place

On the face of the earth or the sky

Hold onto your breath

Hold onto your heart

Hold onto your hope

March up to the gate and bid it open



You're out of the woods

You're out of the dark

You're out of the night

Step into the sun

Step into the light

March up to the gate and bid it open, open
