Poppies / Act I Finale


Poppy Flowers:

We are poppies

In fairest splendor

Blooming fragrant always

Through the mosses and

The grasses looming

Fascinations rare assuming.

We delight when alone to pass

The moments gaily at play

Every petal graciously nods

Our many charms to display.



Poppy Queen:

For death like a breath,

Comes to all soon or late

And mortals are the sport

Of a mischievous fate.

So welcome the peace

That we bring to mankind

It is happiness to dream on,

With every care left behind.



Poppy Flowers:

We are poppies

In fairest splendor

Blooming fragrant always

Through the mosses and

The grasses looming

Fascinations rare assuming.

We delight when alone to pass

The moments gaily at play

Every petal graciously nods

Our many charms to display,

Our charms to display,

Our charms to display.
