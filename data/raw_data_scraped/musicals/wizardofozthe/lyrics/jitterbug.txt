Jitterbug


Who's that hiding in the tree top?

It's that rascal, The Jitterbug!

Should you catch him buzzing 'round you,

Keep away from, The Jitterbug!

Oh! the bees in the breeze and the bats in the trees have a terrible, horrible buzz,

But the bees in the breeze and the bats in the trees couldn't do what The Jitterbug does!

So be careful of that rascal, Keep away from The Jitterbug!

The Jitterbug!

Oh! The Jitter! Oh The Bug!

Oh! The Jitterbug, Bug-a-bug, bug-a-bug, bug-a-boo.

In a twitter, in the throes, Oh the critter's

Got me dancing on a thousand toes, Thar' she blows!
