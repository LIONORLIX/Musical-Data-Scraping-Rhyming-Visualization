Dorothy

'There's no place like home. There's no place like home. There's no place like home.'

Waking up in Kansas

Dorothy returns to the Farm!

Dorothy

'There's no place like home. There's no place like home. There's no place....'

Aunt Em

Wake up, honey.

Dorothy

There's no place like home. There's no place like home. No place.....

Dorothy

Oh, Auntie Em, it's you!

Aunt Em

There, there, lie quiet now. You just had a bad dream.

Hunk

Sure.

Dorothy

But it wasn't a dream. This was a real, truly live place.

And I remember that some of it wasn't very nice - but most of it was beautiful.

But just the same, all I kept saying to everybody was, 'I want to go home!'

And they sent me home.

(All Laugh)

Doesn't anybody believe me?

Uncle Henry

Of course we believe you, Dorothy.

Dorothy

Oh, but anyway, Toto, we're home! Home!

And this is my room - and you're all here!

And I'm not going to leave here ever, ever again, because I love you all! And

Oh, Auntie Em, there's no place like home!!
