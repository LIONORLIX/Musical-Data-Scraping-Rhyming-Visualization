Like a Baby


Man 1

baby

i'm feeling like a baby

a life with brand new feelings

like life has just begun

helpless

i don't know what i am yet

i only know your arms are as warm as the sun

so hold me stay near me

be near when i cry

for when i see your face then i'm firm

like a baby

i'm hungry till you feed me

i just want you to need me

be here and be mine



woman 1, woman 2, man 2

baby

i'm feeling like a baby (i'm feeling like a baby)

a life with brand new feelings (a life with brand new feelings)

like life has just begun (like life has just begun)

helpless (helpless)

i don't know what i am yet (i don't know what i am yet)

i only know your arms are as warm as the sun (know your arms are as warm as the sun)



man1, woman 1, woman 2, man 2

so hold me stay me

be near when i cry

for when i see your face then i'm firm

like a baby

i'm hungry till you feed me

i just want you to need me

be here and be mine





i'll get up tomorrow morning

i'm late for work of course the car won't start.

The brand new vcr just fell apart.

I meet the boss with ketchup on my pants.

My wife announces she wants more romance.

But does the odd catastrophe amaze me?

Oh no, mere cataclysm doesn't faze me.

I'll get up tomorrow morning,

take a deep breath and go on



when problems come my way as well they must,

i'm proud to say i know how to adjust.

My ten year old's best friend is smoking pot.

The roof will cost a grand i haven't got.

My daughter says the acting bug just bit her.

My teenage son is sleeping with the sitter.

I'll get up tomorrow morning,

make a great big bull shot, drink it and go on.



And then of course there's my amazing wife,

that myst'ry woman tied to me for life.

I never know who'll greet me at my house:

the broker of the month or minnie mouse.

She says she loves her job and i believe her.

And then she takes a class, and she's this weaver.

I'll get up tomorrow morning, say the past is prelude,

stay loose, drop a quaalude and go on.



At times i think that i am rather brave

for smiling as i near an early grave.

But i do not want points for having hope.

I have this little trick that helps me cope.

It isn't avant-garde or even trendy.

It's just this one man's modus operandi:

no matter how my stomach may be churning,

or what new lesson i'm again relearning,

i'll get up tomorrow morning, take a hot bath,

do my push-ups, feed the puppies,

eat my oatbran, throw up and go on.

(aaaaagh!!)
