Life Story


It was a liberated marriage

We shared the household chores of course

We understood each others feelings

Right down to the day of our sensible divorce



I didn't ask him for a penny

I'd had my liberated training



So off he went with his hair of bronze

To find a life like Khalil Gibran's

I got my rest from the drugs he did

He got his quest,

I got the kid



And oh,

I'm not complaining



So I set off to be a writer,

A modern mother on her own

I wrote up happenings at galleries

Turned down jobs with salaries

Stayed freelance and alone



I fought the battles of the sixties

Which you recall were rather draining

When men were thick, I hit the fray

Became a prick

Got equal pay

I faced down chauvinistic slobs

I won the fights

Improved the jobs



And oh,

I'm not complaining



My husband found himself his ashram

Lost forty pounds and went through hell

Then one day he came back from limbo

Found himself some bimbo

And moved to New Rochelle



I raised my son and I had lovers

My choices sometimes take explaining

I'd meet some jock

My friends would scoff

He'd stay a while

I'd drive him off

I kept my space

Preserved my turf

Six months I'd send him back to surf



And oh-oh-oh-oh-oh,

I was not complaining



So now my son's half way through college

I pay tuition like a fine

I'm still this feisty freelance writer

Resume well honed

At a well toned forty-nine



I find that getting work is harder

Each job I want takes more campaigning

And those sweet young things who hire me now

Those MBAs making fifty thou

Who smile and ask what I have done

When they got their jobs from the fights I won



Ah, they should all stay home and have babies



But I'm not complaining



And in the evening at my window

As I watch Jersey growing dim

I feel a troubling emotion

Summed up in this notion

I wish I'd stayed with him



Lord knows each day with him was madness

As I have spent my life maintaining



But more and more I recall the joy

My golden dreamer

My lost boy

Our life was life in the twilight zone

But no worse than a life alone



And oh,

Well I chose my way

And I'm not complaining
