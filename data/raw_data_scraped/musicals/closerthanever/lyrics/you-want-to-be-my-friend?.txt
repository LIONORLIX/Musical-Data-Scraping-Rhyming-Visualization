You Want to Be My Friend?


Man 2

You're so good

You're too good for me you are

You're the best damn person

I have known by far

If i could,

You know i'd never throw this curve

You're a goddess

And i'm not what you deserve

What i am saying is

Our thing must end

But though it must

I want to be your friend



Woman 2

Friend? Friend?

You wanna be my friend?

You wanna be my friend?

Oh, that's nice

You wanna be my friend



I have friends i know from college

High school pals that i still see

I have sisters in soror'ties

'Cross the country fond of me

Two chums that date from grade school

One whole fam'ly in st. Paul

There are kids i know from summer camp who still give me a call

I have friends from when i lived in paris

And my singles cruise

I have five old boyfriends who still call me up to schmooze

I have buddies from the lab in boston

Colleagues from the zoo

I've got an aunt in cleveland

That i always can turn to



I got enough friends!!!



Man 2

(perhaps i should be going)



You stay right there.



You wanna be my friend

You wanna be my friend

Well i'm touched

You wanna be my friend



I want a lover and a husband

And a partner and a spouse

I want someone to split expenses with me

On a summer house



I want a father for my unborn children

Someone who's in tune

And since i'll be thirty-nine next month

I want him rather soon

I want someone to buy rugs and lamps with

Someone who'll co-sign

I want a small joint bank account

In his name and in mine



I need someone i can fight with

Learn to cook with

Love to feed

Come to think of it

There's only one thing that i do not need



I don't need another friend!!!



Man 2

(i really think i...)



You stay right there!

(you're right, i deserve this you're such

A wonderful person and i'm such a...)



I don't need to hear from you i'm perfect

Then end up all wet

I am tired of being the greatest girl

A man has ever met

(but i don't want to make a commitment to you)

Ha! Can't you see?

You don't want to tell the truth, oh no

You just want out from me

Yes, i know inside you're fragile

Yes, you're mother was a mess

If that's why you can't receive a woman's love

I could care less.

I don't need to know it's your fault

Have some balls

It doesn't fit

You're not sick, deprived, misunderstood or weak

You're just a shit!

And you wanna be my friend

Who'd want you as a friend?



Is my name on this lease?

Huh?

Is my name on this lease?

Yeah.



Then get out of my apartment!!
