Woman 1

My power lunch is on

With my client down at merck

Then i must be in court

For a meeting with the clerk

The au pair has her class

But still i can make it work

If maybe

You take the baby



Man 2

Oh god, i'm sympathetic

My closing's set for two

The buyer's in from phoenix

My partner has the flu

The fact is i was here on the verge of asking you

If maybe

You'd take the baby



Woman 1

Of course, i know what you're doing's

Really vital stuff

I know how much your life's

On the line



Man 2

Re-starting your career

Which i can't support enough

Makes your work as important

As mine



Woman 1

But still i'm wondering

Is there some way



Man 2

But still i'm thinking

What would you say



Woman 1

That you could just

Adjust things today



Man 2

If you could sort of

Manage to stay



Woman 1

I'll make your favorite breakfast



Man 2

I'll be your bestest friend



Both

I need a little help here, ok?



Woman 1

I'm sure there's nothing to it



Man 2

A call or two will do it



Woman 1

I have to make it clear here!



Both

We're talking my career here!



Woman 1

Okay i'm out the door

I know you can get it done



Man 2

I know you'll work it out dear

I really have to run



Both

When you have your appointment

I bet it would be fun

If maybe

You take the baby



Woman 1

Darling i know today is fateful



Man 2

I know that this is hateful



Woman 1

I know you've got a plateful



Man 2

Can't tell you how i'm grateful



Woman 1

The bottle's in the buggy



Man 2

We're down to our last huggie.



Both

The baby's here.

I love you dear.

Goodbye!
