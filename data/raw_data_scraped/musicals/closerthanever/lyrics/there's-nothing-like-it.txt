There's Nothing Like It


Man 2

There's nothing like it

There's nothing like it in the world

This lovely feeling of well-being

What you're seeing

Is a man who's incredibly fit!

Would you believe it?

That once i weighed two hundred fifty

I was a pudgy as a pig

Not just big

I was fat

I was gross

But now i'm trim and nifty

God reached his hand down and granted me a gifty: health!



Woman 1 man 2

I feel so healthy there's nothing like it in the world

And you can bet the moment

I zip up my sweater

Wow!

I feel better

Pow!



Man2, woman 1

It's so great to feel fit this is it



Man 1

Would you believe it there's nothing like it

Two years ago i felt a chest pain

There's nothing like it

I heard my doctor mention stroke

I bought the gym shorts

And i broke

I bought the sweat-suit

Bought some weights

I bought the snorkel

Gave up coke

I bought the wetsuit

Joined a gym

That's when our psyches

Bought a bike

Began to feed us

Learned to swim

We bought the nikes

Learned to hike

And the adidas



Woman 2

Bought a scale

Which showed i had to take control below

And so i bought myself jane fonda



Man 2, woman 1, man 1

Have you noticed one two one two one two one two

That in the fonda family jane is thin one two and young too

And peter's thin one two and young two

And hank was thin

Wonder if i'm getting younger?

They're just thin

Yes i'm feeling younger

And they're always been

One and two and getting younger

The fonda's younger, younger,

Are thin people younger, younger...



All

There's nothing like it

There's nothing like it in the world

It must be wonderful to witness

All this fitness

How we wish we were you watching us!



Men women

Would you believe it?

Would you believe this turn of fate?

Once i was not considered sexy

That once i could not get a date

Now i'm considered quite the stud

As i perspire

Full of bean

My future's brighter

Hotter blood

My breasts are higher

Tighter jeans

My buns are tighter



All

Now life is fun and free of all those tensions

'Til i run into the thing nobody mentions:

Pain! Ugh! Pain! Ugh!



Man 1

Pain, i feel pain

In my calves, in my thighs others

Pain, pain....

In my heart, in the blood

Pounding deep in my eyes



Man 1, woman 2

Well, it's good when you hurt

Yes, it's good when you strive

When you hurt you're awake

When you ache you're alive



Man 1, woman 1, woman 2

I read in a book that the pain that you feel

Is the right sort of pain

It's the proof that you're real



All

I've read all the books and i live them all day

And i heard what they wrote

And all i can say is:

Bullshit

Bullshit



Hush now

What's this rush now

After torturing my bo

Can it be there's a god after all?

I think i'm breaking through the wall

And all at once i'm standing tall

I can feel my backbone lengthen

Shoulders straighten

Heartbeat strengthen

Look there,

The home stretch

I'm filled with grace from facing the odds

The thrill of the chase

As i race with the gods

Is like nothing in the world



And i am never growing old

And i am going for the gold

And my life story will be sold

'Cause i'm like nothing in the world!
