What Am I Doin'?


She was such an incredible woman

and one night we both set ourselves free

i could see all the power inside her

and she seems to release it to me



then she suddenly said i can't see her

and the thought of it drove me insane

so i find up a tree i can creeping

to the roof over where she is sleeping

and i sit there all night in the rain

and i'm thinking

what am i doin' up on a roof?

What am i doin' out in the rain?

What kind of feelings make a man blind?

What am i doing out of my mind with love?



(and her father and my father are down on the lawn,

and they're shouting...)



What is he doin' up on a roof?

What is he doin' out in the rain?

What kind of feelings make a man blind?

What kind of guy goes out of his mind with love?



I decided that i'd learned my lesson

i rejoined all the sensible men

now no matter how tempting the woman

i won't ever go crazy again



when i'm safe and alone in my bedroom

thanking god i'm not shaking and wet

i think back to that night i felt tingles

holding tight not to slide down the shingles

feeling feelings i'll never forget



and i wish i was saying

what am i doin' up on a roof?

What am i doin' out in the rain?

What kind of feelings make a man blind?

What am i doing out of my mind with...



What am i doin' tailin' her car?

What am i doin' inside her bushes?

What am i doin' covered with mud?

What am i doin' out of my mind with love, with love

what am i doin'...?



What am i doin' stealin' her scarf?

What am i doin' sniffin' her perfume?

What am i doin' sifting her trash?

What am i doin' testing her doorknob?

Dialin' her phone?

Tramplion; her tulips?

Buggin' her friends?

Pettin' her dog?

Oh what am i doin' out of my mind with love?

What am i doing out of my mind with love?
