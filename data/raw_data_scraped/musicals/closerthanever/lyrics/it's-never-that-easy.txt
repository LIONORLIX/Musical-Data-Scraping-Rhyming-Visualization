It's Never That Easy


Woman 1

You just met him, yes, i know

This is lasting, this will grow

But oh, it's never that easy

Believe me, it isn't at all



You are starstruck, so was i

I would love him, till i die

But oh, it's never that easy

My darling, not easy at all



All your life you'll be with him

Think of that, think it through

He may chase some crazy whim

When he does, you'll go too



And you'll lose him now and then

But each morning start again

And oh, some days you'll be happy

But it won't be easy

It's never that easy

You think so, but no

Oh no, i know

It isn't at all.



Woman 2

The man says things he needs to say

Turns to smile as he stands at my door

And then i see his eyes are grey

Oh god i've been here before



To want him makes no sense at all

Then we talk and out his feelings pour

Inside all my defences fall

Oh yes i've been here before



The man's all wrong

That's all that's true

And what is worse

This time good god he's twenty-two

And since it's wrong, before we start

Why should i rush to prove that i can break my heart all over?

The man leaves and i'm on my own

I sit here and simply watch the door

And tell myself i'm fine alone

Oh yes, i've been here before

Oh yes, i've been here before



Woman 2	 woman 1

The man's all wrong	 but oh

That's all that's true	 it's never that easy

And what is worse	 believe me

This time, good god,

He's twenty-two	 it isn't at all

And since it's wrong	 he may chase

Before we start	 some crazy whim

Why should i rush let him go

To prove	 or he'll

That i can break my heart all over	 break your heart



The man leaves and i'm on my own	 i'm fine alone without him

I sit here and simply watch the door	and you'll miss him now and then

Then tell myself i'm fine alone	 i'm fine alone



Oh yes i've been here before	 oh yes i've been here before

But it won't be easy

Some days you'll be happy

No never that easy

But it won't be easy

You think so but no

Oh, no



Both

I know

I've been here before
