There


Woman 2

There

He was never there

Every time we talked

I'd look in his eyes

And his mind was...where?



I don't mean to say

Life was gloom and doom

Things were always pleasant

If i needed help

He was in the room

He just wasn't present



He just wasn't there

Never really there

I felt so unhinged

I went out and binged

Had that dumb affair



Still the fault's not mine

Quoting gertrude stein

There was just no there there

There there



Don't know why i care

'Cept that i am here

'Cause he wasn't



Man 3 (woman 2)

There	(there)

I was never...(there)

...there

She was always (there)

Saying george be (there)

And my mind said...where?



Did i have a choice?

Love is worth a fight

Not a thing you squander (yoo hoo george?)

Then i'd hear her voice (george?)

Urgent and uptight (hello?)

And my mind would wander (come in george)



So i wasn't there (couldn't he be there?)

Never really there (once an evening there)

And i felt maligned

That my vagrant mind

Meant i didn't care (it was clear that he didn't care)



Then to make things smooth

She would try to soothe

Sticking in her "there, there" there (there there)



Got out of her hair

'Cause she made it clear

That i wasn't there



Woman 2 (man 3)

I'm not a jerk

Thought it's the way i seem (wanted to be there)

He had his work

I gave him time to dream (knew i should be there)

Lost my desire

Waiting till he awoke (worked at being there)

Longing for fire

Living with smoke

Isn't a joke



Man 3 (woman 2)

I tried to go her way

Wanting things improved

Tired of being not there

(is it so hard a task?)



Think of my dismay

Finding she had moved

By the time i got there

(too much to ask?)



She was over there

(i was here, i was always here)

Where the hell was there?

(there was here

Could it be more clear?)



Both

Groping like the blind

How we hoped to find

One place we could share



Faults we tried to hide

Living side by side

Funny, when they're there, they're there



Woman 2

There, there

And it isn't fair



Man 3

No, it really isn't fair



Woman 2

That we wind up here



Man 3

That we wind up here



Both

When we once were

...there.

Do do do do do do do do do do do...
