Another Wedding Song


Man 1

The future's here

The past is dead

I won't dissect or weight it

But something small's

Been left unsaid

And now's the time to say it



You're not my first

As well you know

Once before i leapt when marriage beckoned

But you're so much more than merely first

You are the first to be second



Woman 2

I screwed up too

I made a vow

That lasted forty years less that i reckoned

How lucky for you for starting now

You can be first to be second



Man 1

So what if we had bubbles that go burst



Woman 2



All of those mistakes are in the past



Both

I don't care if you are not my first



Man 1

As long as you're the first to be my last



Woman 2

I'd better be



Both

Here's to our first, we learned a lot

Our future will be gloriously fecund



Woman 2

Of first we've had the same amount



Man 1

Now we'll make each second count



Both

From now on my first to be second comes first
