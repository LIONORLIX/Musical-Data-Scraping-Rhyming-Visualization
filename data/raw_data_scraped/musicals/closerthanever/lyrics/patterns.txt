Patterns


Woman 1

Patterns in my life that i trace ev'ry day

Patterns as i say the things i always say

Patterns in the ceiling as i lie awake

Why are patterns haunting ev'ry move i make?



Just look, here i am on cue, again

Upset, feeling torn in two, again

Afraid, saying i'm okay

Making little jokes

Till i run away, again



And yet today i am not the same

I feel my life slipping from its frame

Strange feelings rise, feelings with no name

And i can't face them

So i shake them hard

Fold them up

And tuck them safely away

Again



Patterns that begin as i walk through a door

Patterns in the curtains and the kitchen floor

Patterns in the day's routines i must arrange

Patterns in the ways i try...but never change



Just look, as i'm thrown a curve again

I leap, then i lose my nerve again

In tears, running home i go

Secretly relieved

Safe with what i know, again



And yet i know i am not the same

Inside my heart is something i can't tame

I feel my mind bursting into flame

And i must change

Or else i'll break apart

Or break away

And end up having to start

Again



Patterns through the day

I seem to use to give my life a shape

Patterns through the house

That give me comfort

When i need escape

Patterns that lead me nowhere

At all.
