Back on Base


My scattered life had no foundation

Couldn't seem to find my space

Then all at once came inspiration

Now i'm back on base.



My baby plays a line that subtle

Yet it makes the strongest case

An argument with no rebuttal

Got me back on base.



When his fingers touch my strings

I tingle to my teeth

I seem to sing the wildest things

When he is underneath.



The only worm that's in this eden

The only snag in all this lace

Is where i stand ain't easy reading

When he's back on base.



(scat)



At times he seems a bit elusive

Way off in his private place

I guess he can't be mine exclusive

When he's back on base.



He's got eyes for something tall

So maybe i should go

Then once more my defences fall

When he gets down below oh oh oh oh oh oh



So what if he don't feel like talkin'

I'll just let him play his ace

And let his fingers do the walkin'

'Til i'm back on...



Always back on...



So happy back on base.



(scat)



We make sweet music when we're both back on base
