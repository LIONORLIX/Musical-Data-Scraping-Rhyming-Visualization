Sound of Muzak


All

music, music

i hear music ah, ah, ah, ah

music...



Man 2

once upon a time this was drab world all

(drab world, drab world, drab world)

ev'rything on earth was dull and bare

(dull and bare, and dull and bare, and)

then one day a wise man had a thought

what we need is music

yes!

Everywhere



man 1

so someone went out and invented the phonograph.



Maybe you recall how every evening

everybody gathered round the chair

every now and then you'd stop to think

how nice

to have music, everywhere.



Woman 2

then, to make things even nicer, someone invented the radio.



Woman 1

wasn't it a wonder when it happened

every little room now had it's share



woman 2

every little care had q-x-r



all

but this was not music, music everywhere.



Man 2

so, someone invented musak.

Softly, gently, never going overboard others

ooh ooh ooh ooh...

Every moment now was subtly underscored

ahh ahh ahh ahh...



All

how could there be sadness...



Man 1

in a world where the grocery store next door has music



woman 1

the little french restaurant with all the atmosphere has music



man 2

the gentleman's restroom

and the ladies room has music



man 1

the delicatessen has music



woman 2

and your office and you elevator and your incinerator has music!



Man 1, man 2, woman 2 woman 1

glory it was lovely la la la...

'Til a genius

visiting the country for some air everywhere

cocked his little head and halted dead.



All

he did not hear music, music, everywhere.



Man 2

the man was stunned. So he went home and invented the portable cassette player.



All

yes, oh yes. Ah, yes oh yes, ah, yes oh yes, ah yes!

Now from every mountain to the prairies

to the ocean white with sand

everyone on earth is feeling grand

because there is music, music, everywhere

everywhere, everywhere, everywhere.



Woman 2

did you think that science would be satisfied? Others

(oh no oh no oh no oh no)

woman 1

is your urge for music fully gratified?

(oh no oh no oh no oh no)

all

now they've got a gadget you can

plug inside your brain and shoot the music

straight into your system

get the music pumping right into your blood stream

make your lymph glands shoot into the marrow of your very bones!



Everywhere you go now

you've got music

from your tippy toes up to your hair

anyone who sees that glassy stare

knows you have got music

music, music, happy music, happy, happy

music, music, music, music, music, mu-



man 2

silence

woman 1

isn't it wonderful

man 1

i can think again

woman 2

think?

Man 2

yeah, think...



All

still you have to admit, it's nice with music everywhere,

music, music, music, music

everywhere!!
