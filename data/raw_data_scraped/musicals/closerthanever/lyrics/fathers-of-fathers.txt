Fathers of Fathers


Man 1

Hey billy, my baby

Hey kid, look at me

It's clear you've got your mother's eyes

But who do they see?

The nurse just called me father

Well hell, i guess that's what i am

But what makes her thing i'm a family man



Those fathers of fathers, fathers of mothers

How can you know what it's worth.

For all my aspiration

Are you to be the indication

That i walked the face of this earth



Man 3

My children, i miss you

How much you can't know

I laughed with you, i cried with you

Helped each of you grow

I kissed you ev'ry bedtime

Your laughter woke me every dawn

Then one day i woke and you'd grown and gone



Man 1 & 3

And fathers of fathers, fathers of mothers

Strange how kids measure your worth

There here and then they scatter

And in some way they make it matter

That i walked the face of this earth



Man 2

Hey fathers, i love you

I pray you'll pull through

You cared for me, it's my turn now

To take care of you

I've tried to show my children

The kid of strength you showed to me

I feel such a longing to be a son

Instead now i'm one of those



All

Fathers of fathers, fathers of mothers

What man can say what it's worth

This commonest of pleasures

Why should it be a thing that measures

That i walked the face of the earth
