Closer Than Ever


Company

Well what d'ya know, a door locked tight

Opens at last and shows some light

Once more a door you tried and tried

Gives and you're on the other side

You were unsure and yet somehow

Look at where you are standing now

Out of the blue

An answer comes to you

You never knew you knew



Man 2

Nobody thought we'd last

Good thing we never knew it

It's funny how after all these years we're closer than ever



We had so much to learn

Some days i thought we blew it

But strange as it seems it took the pain

To bind us together

Closer than ever



And now

We're steadier by half

Thank god we learned to laugh

Thank god when you found your new you

I loved her too



We still have our stormy days

Even the worst can't shake us

If all we have come through could not break us

What's ahead can only make us

Stronger than ever

Clearer than ever

I'm closer than ever to you



Woman 2

We still have our stormy days

Man 2

Even the worst can't shake us

All

If all we have come through could not break us

What's head can only make us stronger than ever

Clearer than ever

I'm closer than ever to you



Bows...
