The Mason


SINGER

He builds a house

With his hands

Thirty years go by

It stands

It stands where nothing stood

A house of stone

The mason sleeps real good



He does his work

His workday flies

Quittin' time's a big surprise

And then it's one more stone

To get just right

It's always one more stone

Before the night



Every house he builds

Every stone he lays

It's not just makin' money

And countin' off the days



He builds a house

With his hands

A hundred years go by

It stands

It tells you who he was

A life goes fast

But the work a mason does

It's made to last

The work a mason does



ANTHONY

(spoken)

Nothing in this world lasts forever,

But with stone you're getting awful close.



SINGER

(sung)

It's made to last
