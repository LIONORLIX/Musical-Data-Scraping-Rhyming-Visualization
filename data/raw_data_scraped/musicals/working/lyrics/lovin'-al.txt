Lovin' Al


AL

I'm known from Peking to Hong Kong

From the West Coast to the Pecos

Hikin' cars is my game

In an automobile

I used to be fire on wheels

That's what earned me my name...



Ask anybody to tell you 'bout Lovin' Al

You can ask anybody, and anybody will tell you

There was a time when nobody

Could beat me doing what I do.

I'd punch out a ticket,

Slide under the wheel,

And right off the bat

Have it under control

Usin' one hand I'd spin 'er around

And without lookin' back

Put 'er straight in the hole



(spoken) People wonder how I do it. Ain't nothin' to it!



(sung)

'Cause I'm Lovin' Al, the wizard

"One-Swing-Al", that's me

Lovin' Al is a wizard

So don't be surprised at what you see

One swing in

One swing out

Look out

There he goes...



Why can't I be a rich man

With some big bucks in my jeans?

I'd buy me a brand new caddy

And a Cohiba cigar

'Cause you can't smoke dem' Pantella's

When you're ridin' in a rich man's car.



I see 'em get out with thier tuxedoes on

And when I get in I can smell the cologne

The music be up and I listen a-while

Just sittin' pretendin' like it was my own



(spoken) I may sit longer than I should. 'Cause it feels so good



(sung) To Lovin' Al, the wizard
