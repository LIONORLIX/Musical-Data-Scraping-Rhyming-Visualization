Joe


You wake at ten

Fold up the bed

You cook an egg

You toast some bread

You think about the day ahead

It's like I said



You take a walk

You meet a chum

You shoot the bull

You argue some

You lose at gin

Until they come

The dirty bum



You take a bus

You take a train

It does you good

to use your brain

You take a stroll

Down memory lane

And raisin' cane



I remember once back in '42

we were at this fair

with these girls we knew

on this crazy ride

where you screamed or you prayed



we could hardly walk

so we staggered down

for a candy bar

then we sat and laughed

in the penny arcade



at six o'clock

you watch the news

you get some franks

no big to-do's

you watch a game

you take a snooze



you change your shirt

and shine your shoes

you shoot some pool

you drink some beer

you find a pal

you bend his ear

the kinda song you never hear

and then you cheer



i was at adance

i was seventeen

and the girl was like

from a magazine

and the lights were low

and i really mean low



and i kissed her cheek

as we waltzed away

i remeber that

like it's yesterday

boy, was she surprised

i can hear her say:



"joe!"



they drive you home

from round the block

you take your cash

from out of your sock

you fix teh bed

you check the lock

you wind the clock
