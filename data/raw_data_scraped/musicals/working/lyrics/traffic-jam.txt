Traffic Jam


(Chorus)

Damn this traffic jam

How I hate to be late

It hurts my motor to go so slow

Damn this traffic jam

Time I get home my supper'll be cold

Damn this traffic jam



Well I left my job about 5 o'clock

It took fifteen minutes go three blocks

Just in time to stand in line

With a freeway looking like a parking lot



- Chorus -



Now I almost had a heart attack

Looking in my rear view mirror

I saw myself the next car back

Looking in the rear view mirror

'Bout to have a heart attack

I said



- Chorus -



Now when I die I don't want no coffin

I thought about it all too often

Just strap me in behind the wheel

And bury me with my automobile



- Chorus -



Damn...



Now I used to think that I was cool

Running around on fossil fuel

Until I saw what I was doing

Was driving down the road to ruin
