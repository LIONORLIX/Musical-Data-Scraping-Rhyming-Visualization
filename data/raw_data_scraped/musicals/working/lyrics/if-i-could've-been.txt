If I Could've Been


Man

If I could've been

What I could've been

I could've been somethin'...



Woman

I wanted to be a writer...



Man

...a major-league baseball player...



Man

...own a little farm...



Man

If what I could be

Had been left to me

I would've been somethin'...



Woman

...but then I got married...



Man

...then the kids came along...



Man

...but then my dad took sick...



Man

A tower of strength

A center of power

At ten bucks an hour...



Woman

If I could've done what I could've done

I could've done big things

With some luck to do what I wanted to.

I would've done big things

Swam a few rivers,

Climbed a few hills,

Paid all my bills...



Woman and others

Now It's just dreams that I'm stuck with

And hell, that aint a lot to show

I haven't gone far from the starting line

But deep down inside where it counts I know...



Solo

I know I could've gone

Where I could've gone

I could've gone places



With leeway to go

Far as I could go

I would've gone places

To the

Front of the line,

The top of the tier,

A long way from here...



Way back then I had ambition

A lot of stamina and guts

I never took "no" for an answer

It was tougher to fight

All those if's, and's or but's...



All

All those If's and's or but's

But if I...



Man, Woman

Could've been

What I could've been

I could've been somethin'

If my destiny

Had been left to me

I would've been somethin



Another woman

IF they had just let me go

Where I was rarin' to go

When I was rarin' to go

Back then...



All

God only knows

What I could've been

Oh, what I could've been-

Hey somebody,

Don'cha wanna hear

The story of my life.
