Neat to Be a Newsboy


Newsboy

Gee, it's neat to be a newsboy

You ride your bike around the neighborhood

You get known at the stores

And outa your chores

And it pays real good

It you're eleven

Gee, I dig the world of finance

And doing business like my daddy does

And I could grow up to the Horatio Alger

Whoever he was

Oh, I like my paper route quite a bit

But there's one part that's my favorite



You put your hands around the paper

Throw the paper in the bushes

Watch the bushes go Boin-n-n-g-g-g

You watch the bushes go Sproin-n-n-g-g-g

You watch the bushes go...

So when your head is draggin'

Cause your mommas been a-naggin'

And your sister's been annoying

Go throw the paper in the bushes

Watch the bushes go Boin-n-n-g-g-g-g-g



Hey, it's boss tomeet the public

You learn who pays you quick and who forgets

You learn new words to swear

And things to beware

Like having debts

And german shepards

Hey, it's nifty making contacts

There's major people in half a mile

And i could grow up to be the president someday

If I practice my smile

And anytime I want to call it quits

I just think about those fringe benefits...



Everyone

You put your hands aroung the paper

Throw the paper in the bushes

Watch the bushes go



Newsboy

Boin-n-n-g-g-g



Everyone

You watch the bushes go



Newsboy

Sproin-n-n-g-g-g



Everyone

You watch the bushes go...



Newsboy

So long as I'm in business

You know where you can find me

Working and enjoying

Throw the Paper in the bushes

And Watch the bushes go

Boing...

G-g-g-g-g-g-g!
