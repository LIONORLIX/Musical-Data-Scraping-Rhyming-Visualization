I'm Just Movin'


Babe:

There isn?t a thing you don?t want that isn?t in this store.

From soda pop to a genuine pearl in a can of oysters.

And I know the code for every one of them.

On the register is a little book with all the codes, I never look at it.



You got your green grapes forty-twenty-two

And your reds is forty-twenty-three

You got your granny smith seventeen

Australian navel twelve

I tell you it just comes to me

I got my right hand ready on the register

Use my left to scan the groceries



And when I ?P.L.U.? it

For the flowers or the fruit

I never have to look at the keys

Please! I?m just movin?



Other Checkers:

Pedal, scan, scan, code, scan



Babe:

I?m just movin?



Other Checkers:

Pedal, scan, scan, code, scan



Babe:

Way more fun than some high-techer

Workin? as a checker

And movin? movin? movin?



Other Checkers



Any coupons?



Babe:

When I got out of high school way back when

Didn?t want no secretary job

I heard the grocery callin? me callin? even then

And I still love it though the work is hard

You see these part-time girls work slow all week

Then Friday night go dancin? for their kicks

But here is where I?m dancin?

And my mood?ll be enhancin?

I even come on days I feel sick

And quick-I?m just movin?



Other Checkers:



Pedal, scan, scan, code, scan



Babe:

Other Checkers:



Pedal, scan, scan, code, scan



Babe:

Way more fun than some high-techer

Workin? as a checker

And movin? movin? movin?



Well, sure my feet get tired,

Got my aches and pains

By the time I was eighteen

I had the varicose veins

But I put on my support hose

And my doctor Scholl?s shoes

Head down to Treasure Island

Dance away blues

By just movin?



(speaking)



When I go on vacation, it?s great for maybe two, or three days,

But then I get so lonesome for this place.

I look foreword to coming to work. I love it something terrible!



(singing)



So I don?t want no office, no sirree

give me the grocery

No matter how hectic it gets

I?ll be movin? movin? movin? movin?

Movin? movin? movin? movin?

Movin? movin? movin? movin?

Babe and her Treasure Island superettes!



(speaking)



Paper or plastic?
