Something to Point To


See that building

I was the one who did the design

I was the one who drafted the plan

Every detail and every line

See that building

I ran the crane that lifted the beams

I was teh guy that worked up above

Look at those bricks, those bricks are mine

See that building

Look how my door hangs in the frame

See that building

Forty flights up i scratched my name



See that building

I'm on the staff, i work as a guard

I clean the floors and i clean 'em good

People don't know my job is hard

See that building

Five days a week i work at a desk

I do the books, i handle the mail

Nine on the dot i punch my card



See that window

Up by the ledge

Ten from the top

See that window

Count from the left

One, two , three, syop

That's where i work



Everyone shoul dhave something to point to

Something to be proud of

Look what i did

See what i've done

I did the job

I was the one

Evryone should have something to point to

Someway to be tall in the crowd

Proud



See that building

Day after day after day after day

That's where i put myself on the line

That's where i sweat to earn my pay

See that building

That's where i put the food on our plates

That's where i've lived a piece of my life

Where i can bring my kids and say



See that building

The lumber was cut

Decisions were made

See that building

The windows are washed

The site was surveyed

The memos are typed

The concrete was laid

The records are kept

The office is run

The coffee is sold

The digging was done

The building was built

For all eyes to see

Me
