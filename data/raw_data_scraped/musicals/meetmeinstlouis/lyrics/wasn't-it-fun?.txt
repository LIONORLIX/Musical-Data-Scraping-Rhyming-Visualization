Wasn't It Fun?


MRS. SMITH

WASN'T IT FUN? WASN'T IT FINE?



MR. SMITH

[Recognizing the tune.]

Whatever made you think of that?



BOTH

WONDERFUL DAYS OF AULD LANG SYNE;

WASN'T IT FINE? WASN'T IT FUN?



MR. SMITH

OURS IS A ROMANCE SECOND TO NONE.



BOTH

RAIN AND SUN, SUN AND RAIN

TEARS AND LAUGHTER, JOY AND PAIN.



MR. SMITH

SUN AND RAIN, RAIN AND SUN,

LIFETIMES AND LIFETIMES ROLLED INTO ONE.



BOTH

AND ALWAYS SUCH FUN, ALWAYS SO FINE,

WONDERFUL DAYS OF AULD LANG SYNE,

AND MERRY,



MRS. SMITH

[Laughing, as they reminisce.]

VERY,



BOTH

SIMPLY BECAUSE YOUR HAND WAS IN MINE
