Under the Bamboo Tree


Esther:

now.

down in the jungles lived a maid

of royal blood though dusky shade

tootie:

a marked impression once she made

upon a zulu



Esther:

from matabooloo



Tootie:

and every morning, he would be

down underneath a bamboo tree



Esther:

awaitin' there his love to see



Tootie:

and then to her he'd sing



Both:

to her he'd sing



Esther:

vamp.



Both:

if you like-a me

like i like-a you

and we like-a both the same

i like-a say this very day

i like-a change your name

'cause i love-a you

and love-a you true

and if you-a love-a me

one live as two

two live as one

under the bamboo tree
