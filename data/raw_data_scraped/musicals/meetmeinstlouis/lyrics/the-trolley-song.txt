The Trolley Song


[ding ding ding]

[ding ding ding]



[ding-ding-ding-ding-ding-ding]



All:

clang, clang, clang

went the trolley

ding, ding, ding

went the bell

zing, zing, zing

went my heartstrings

as we started

for huntington dell



chug, chug, chug

went the motor

bump, bump, bump

went the brake

thump, thump, thump

went my heartstrings

as we glided

for huntington lake



the day was bright,

the air was sweet

the smell of honeysuckle

charmed me off my feet

i tried to sing

but couldn't squeak

in fact, i felt so good

i couldn't even speak



buzz, buzz, buzz

went the buzzer

time to all disembark

time to fall

went my heartstrings



as we got off

at huntington park

as we got off

at huntington park



some guy shouts:

hey! look who's coming!



Esther:

with my high-starched collar

and my high-topped shoes

and my hair piled high upon my head

i went to lose a jolly

hour on the trolley

and lost my heart instead



with his light brown derby

and his bright green tie

he was quite the handsomest of men



i started to yen

so i counted to 10

then i counted to 10 again



clang, clang, clang

went the trolley

ding, ding, ding

went the bell

zing, zing, zing

went my heartstrings

from the moment

i saw him, i fell



chug, chug, chug

went the motor

bump, bump, bump

went the brake

thump, thump, thump

went my heartstrings

when he smiled,

i could feel the car shake



All:

clang, clang,clang



Esther:

he tipped his hat

and took a seat

he said he hoped he hadn't

stepped upon my feet

he asked my name

i held my breath

i couldn't speak because

he scared me half to death



Guy:

hiya, johnny!



Esther:

chug, chug, chug

went the motor

plop, plop, plop

went the wheels

stop, stop, stop

went my heartstrings

as he started to go

then i started to know

how it feels

when the universe reels



All [except ester]:

the day was bright

the air was sweet

the smell of honeysuckle

charmed you off your feet

you tried to sing

but couldn't squeak

in fact, you loved him so

you couldn't even speak

ooohhh



Esther:

buzz, buzz, buzz

went the buzzer

plop, plop, plop

went the wheels

stop, stop, stop

went my heartstrings



as he started to leave

i took hold of his sleeve

with my hand

and as if it were planned

he stayed on with me

and it was grand

just to stand

with his hand holding mine

to the end of the line!



All:

zing, zing, zing

went my heart

heart!
