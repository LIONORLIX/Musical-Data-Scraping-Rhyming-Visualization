She's in Love


ALLANA

I’m talking about Ariel, that’s who!



ADELLA

What about her?



ALLANA

She sure is acting fishy lately!



AQUATA

I’ll say! Swimming in circles! Chasing her tail!



ALLANA

That girl is up to her gills in something!

She’s dizzy and she’s dreamy



AQUATA

Her head’s up in the foam



ATINA

Her eyes have gone all gleamy

It’s like there’s no one home



ALLANA, AQUATA & ATINA

She floats away the days

Mopin’ on the coastal shelf



ANDRINA

You ask her where she’s goin’

She giggles like a fool



ADELLA

She barely sticks a toe in

Down at the tidal pool



ARISTA

It’s more than just a phase

Face it, she’s just not herself



AQUATA

Is she ill?



ATINA

Or insane?



ALLANA

Is it water on the brain?



AQUATA, ATINA, & ALLANA

What has got her bothered so?



ANDRINA

It’s the bends!



ADELLA

It’s the flu!



ARISTA

Gosh, I wish we had a clue!



MERSISTERS

Oh, wait! Oh, dear!

Good grief! It’s clear...

She’s in love!

She’s in love!

Pounding heart! Ringing bells!



ALLANA

Look, I think she’s even wearing brand new shells!



ANDRINA, ARISTA & ADELLA

She’s in love!



AQUATA, ATINA & ALLANA

In love and it’s divine!



ANDRINA, ARISTA & ADELLA

She’s in love!



AQUATA, ATINA & ALLANA

That girl’s on sandbar nine!



ANDRINA, ARISTA & ADELLA

Glory be!



MERSISTERS

Lord above!

Gotta be she’s in love!



ARISTA

Hey, Flounder – d’ya notice anything weird about you-know-who?



FLOUNDER

You mean Ariel? I’ll say!

She acts like she don’t see me

She doesn’t even speak

She treats me like sashimi

Left over from last week

You see her late at night

Tossin’ in her ocean bed



MERSISTERS

Shoop, shoop

Shoop, shoop…



FLOUNDER

She’s moody as a snapper

Oblivious as rocks

You swim right up and tap her—



FLOUNDER & MERSISTERS

She lays there like a lox!

As sure as dogfish bite

Somethin’s made her lose her head!



MERSISTERS

She has lost her head!



FLOUNDER

And she sighs, and she swoons

And she’s hummin’ little tunes



MERSISTERS

Even has a sorta glow



FLOUNDER

What on earth could it be?



MERSISTERS

Any hammerhead can see!



AQUATA & ADELLA

That sigh!



ARISTA & ALLANA

That glow!



ANDRINA & ATINA

That swoon!



FLOUNDER

Oh, no!

She’s in love!



MERSISTERS

She’s flipped, it never fails!



FLOUNDER

She’s in love!



MERSISTERS

All hot beneath her scales!



FLOUNDER

See her hips

How they swish!



MERSISTERS

Well, well, well

Don’t you wonder who’s the lucky seafood dish?



FLOUNDER

She’s in love!



MERSISTERS

She found a deep-sea hunk!



FLOUNDER

She’s in love!



MERSISTERS

And now she’s as good as sunk!



FLOUNDER

See her blush!



MERSISTERS & FLOUNDER

See her grin!

Gotta be love she’s in!



FLOUNDER

Ariel-and-someone swimmin’ in the sea!

K-i-s-s-i-n-g!



MERSISTERS

Her cheeks could not flush pinker!



FLOUNDER

It’s clear as h2o!



MERSISTERS

She’s caught – hook, line and sinker!



ANDRINA, ARISTA & ATINA

Crushed out!



AQUATA, ADELLA & ALLANA

Switched on!



AQUATA, ANDRINA, ARISTA & ALLANA

Worked up!

Far gone!



FLOUNDER

Knocked down!



MERSISTERS

Hard hit!



FLOUNDER

In deep!



MERSISTERS

That’s it!

She’s in love!

She’s in love!



FLOUNDER

She’s in love!



FLOUNDER & MERSISTERS

She’s in love!

She’s in love!

Plain to see!

No mistake!

Look at those moonbeams in her wake!

Obvious what they must be symptoms of—

She’s in love!

She’s in love!

She’s in love!

Shoop, shoop

She’s in love!

Yeah, yeah!
