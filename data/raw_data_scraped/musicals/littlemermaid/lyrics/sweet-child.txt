(SPOKEN)

FLOTSAM:

Poor child

JETSAM:

Poor, sweet child.

FLOTSAM:

She has a very serious problem, hasn’t she?

JETSAM:

Hmm, if only

FLOTSAM:

there were something

JETSAM:

we could do.

ARIEL(always spoken):

Who are you two?



(SUNG)

FLOTSAM:

Sweet child

JETSAM:

Poor child.

FLOTSAM:

So tragic

JETSAM:

so misunderstood.



FLOTSAM:

Dear child

JETSAM:

sad child.

FLOTSAM:

Life’s looking

JETSAM:

shall we say

FLOTSAM:

not good.

JETSAM:

No.



FLOTSAM:

Who will ease her woe’s and worry’s?

JETSAM:

Who will help get her man?

BOTH:

Sweet child. Perhaps the Sea Witch can!

ARIEL:

You can’t possibly mean aunt Ursula?



FLOTSAM:

She knows your dreams

ARIEL:

Father says her magic is evil

JETSAM:

She’ll grant your prayer

ARIEL:

Please I have to go!



FLOTSAM:

She’ll cast a charm

JETSAM:

A tiny spell.

FLOTSAM:

Why the alarm?

JETSAM:

No one will tell

FLOTSAM:

No one will care.

JETSAM:

It’s your affair.



BOTH:

Sweet child

FLOTSAM:

Dear child

JETSAM:

Poor child.

FLOTSAM:

Sad child.

BOTH:

We’ll bring you to her lair right now.

Bet in half a sec,

your prince and you are reconciled.



FLOTSAM:

Together

JETSAM:

Forever

ARIEL:

Take me to her!



BOTH:

Sweet child.
