Part of Your World (Reprise)


ARIEL

Was I too late?



SCUTTLE:

It's hard to say. . . Oh, I--I can't make out a heartbeat!



ARIEL

No, look! He's breathing. Oh, Scuttle. . . just look at him. He's so beautiful.



What would I give

To live where you are?

What would I pay

To stay here beside you?

What would I do to see you

Smiling at me?



Where would we walk?

Where would we run?

If we could stay all day in the sun?

Just you and me

And I could be

Part of your world



I don't know when

I don't how

But I know something's starting right now

Watch and you'll see

Someday I'll be

Part of your world!
