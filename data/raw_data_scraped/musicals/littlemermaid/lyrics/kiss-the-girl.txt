Kiss The Girl


SEBASTIAN [spoken]:

We got to create the right kinda mood.



SCUTTLE [spoken]:

You mean like candlelight and champagne?



SEBASTIAN [spoken]:

Nonsense.  It don't take all that.

Everything we need we got right here:

Percussion. . . strings. . . winds. . . and words. . .



SEBASTIAN & ANIMALS:

There you see her,

sitting there across the way.

She don't got a lot to say,

But there's something about her.

And you don't know why,

But you're dying to try.

You wanna Kiss The Girl.



Yes, you want her.

Look at her, you know you do.

Possible she wants you, too.

There is one way to ask her.

It don't take a word,

Not a single word.



SEBASTIAN:

Go on and Kiss The Girl.



[spoken]

Sing with me now:



[sung]

Sha la la la la la, my oh my.

Look like the boy too shy.

Ain't gonna Kiss The Girl.



Sha la la la la la ain't that sad?

Ain't it a shame, too bad.

He gonna miss the girl.



PRINCE ERIC [spoken]:

You know, I really ought to know your name.  Maybe I could guess. . . Alexandra?  Annabelle?  Beatrice?



SEBASTIAN:

Ariel!  Her name is Ariel!



PRINCE ERIC [spoken]:

. . .Ariel?  Ariel?  Hey, that's kinda pretty.  Okay--Ariel. . .



SEBASTIAN & ANIMALS:

Now's your moment,

Floating in a blue lagoon.

Boy, you better do it soon,

No time will be better.

She don't say a word

And she won't say a word

Until you Kiss The Girl.



Sha la la la la la, don't be scared.

You got the mood prepared,

Go on and Kiss The Girl.



Sha la la la la la, don't stop now.

Don't try to hide it

How you wanna Kiss The Girl.



Sha la la la la la, float along.

And listen to the song,

The song say Kiss The Girl.



Sha la la la la la, the music play.

Do what the music say.

Go on and Kiss The Girl.

Go on and Kiss The Girl.

You've gotta kiss the girl.

Go on and Kiss The Girl.

Go on and Kiss The Girl!
