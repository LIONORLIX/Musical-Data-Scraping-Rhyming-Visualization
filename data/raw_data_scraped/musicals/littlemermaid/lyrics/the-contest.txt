The Contest


GRIMSBY:

Welcome, dear friends, to our contest

The first that this kingdom has ever seen!

We gather today for a vocal display

So our prince may at last choose a queen!



(Spoken)

These six princesses possess the most accomplished voices in all the land! Tonight, one of you will go home with the crown!

May the best woman win!



PRINCESS 1:

Listen to me

Don't I sound rich?

Loud, am I not?

Plus, I've got perfect pitch

Wouldn't you think I'm the girl

The girl who has everything?



PRINCE ERIC (Spoken):

That's not her voice. I'll know it the moment I hear it--



PRINCESS 2:

Listen to this

Clear as can be!

You'll know I'm it

When I hit my high C! Ah!



PRINCESS 3:

Wouldn't you think I'm the girl

The girl who has everything?

Everything! Everything...



PRINCESS 4:

I'm a world-famous coloratura!



PRINCESS 5:

My vibrato is second to none!



PRINCESS 6:

I'm a walking display of bravura!



PRINCESSES:

It's so clear...

Can't you hear?



PRINCESS 5:

I'm the one!



PRINCESS 1:

I'm the one!



PRINCESS 4:

I'm the one!



PRINCESSES 3 & 6:

I'm the one!



PRINCESSES:

I'm the one!
