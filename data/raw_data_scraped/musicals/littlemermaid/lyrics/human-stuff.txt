SCUTTLE(spoken): Wow - this is special...this very very unusual.



ARIEL(spoken): What? What is it?



SCUTTLE(spoken): It's a dinglehopper!



ARIEL: A dinglehopper?



SCUTTLE: Oh these babies are fantabulous. Absolutely indispensary. When it comes to dingle hoppers I'm a regular

encyclopoodia!



Say thatcha wanna have a hairdo

Like the folds who live up there do

That'll flap their wigs!



GULL 1: Flop their wigs!



GULL 2: Flap!



GULL 3: Awwwk!



SCUTTLE: Well, you'll look absolutely dandy

If you use one of these handy

Little thingmajigs!



GULL 1: Thingmabobs.



GULL 2: Jigs!



GULL 1: Bobs!



GULL 3: Awwwk!



SCUTTLE: Pick up the dinglehopper, just like so

Twirl it the way I'm twirling now!

Give it a little yank, and there ya go!

You're what the call "the dog's meow"!



GULLS: Wonderful stuff!



GULL 3: Awwwk!



GULLS: That human stuff!

Can't get enough -



GULL 3: Awwwk!



GULLS: Of human stuff!

And we are the authority -

No need for us to bluff!

Because we're great and explanatin'

Human stuff!



ARIEL(spoken): (holds pipe) Whats that?



SCUTTLE(spoken): A snarfblatt!



ARIEL(spoken): Wow!



SCUTTLE: Back when the world was prehistorial

People sat as still as coral

Flat upon their bumps



GULL 1: On their runts!



GULL 2: Bunks!



GULL 3: Awwwk!



SCUTTLE: There they would be, not even thinkin'

Bored to death and barely blinkin'

Way down at the dumps



GULL 1: On the dumps!



GULL 2: At!



GULL 1: On!



GULL 3: Awwwk!



SCUTTLE: Then they invented snarfblatts, just by chance

Suddenly life was la-di-da!

Snarfblatts're what you use to make folks dance

Give it a blow, and then - voila!



GULLS: Wonderful stuff!



GULL 3: Awwwk!



GULLS: That human stuff!

If you're a buff -



GULL 3: Awwwk!



GULLS: Of human stuff!



GULL 1: It's marvable!



GULL 2: Stupendible!



SCUTTLE: Completely A-OJ!

Which sounds absurd, but take my word -



GULLS: That's what the humans say!



SCUTTLE&GULLS: Sensible stuff

That human stuff!

None of it fluff -

Not human stuff!

And heaven knows

Since we're the pros

From us, you'll get no guff



SCUTTLE: And once you've got a who's-ma-gig -



GULL 1: A thing-ma-what -



GULL 2: A watch-ma-gig -



SCUTTLE: That's all you need to bring you up to snuff!



GULLS: Right up to snuff!

With proper dinglehopper groomin'

Rest assured...you'll look real human!



SCUTTLE: We know, 'cause we know

Human stuff!
