Under the Sea (Reprise)




SEBASTIAN & SEA CREATURES

The newt play the flute

The carp play the harp

The plaice play the bass

And they soundin sharp

The bass play the brass

The chub play the tub

The fluke is the duke of soul



SEBASTIAN

Yes he is.



SEBASTIAN & SEA CREATURES

The ray, he can play

The lings on the strings

The trout rockin? out

The blackfish, she sings

The smelt and the sprat

They know where it?s at

An? oh, that blowfish blow!



Under the sea

Under the sea

When the sardine begin the beguine

It?s music to me

What do they got, a lot of sand?

We got a hot crustacean band



SEBASTIAN & SEA CREATURES

Each little clam here know how to jam here, Under the sea

Each little slug here cutting a rug here, Under the sea

We got a hot crustacean band here, Under the sea

Each little snail here know how to wail here

That?s why it?s hotter under the water

Ya, we in luck here down in the muck here

Under the?



See, child, that?s what I?m talking about!

You got to put your back into it. Ariel! Hello? Uh oh.
