One Step Closer


PRINCE ERIC

(spoken)

Who needs words? Dancing beats small talk any day. It's the way your feet smile. Or laugh. It lets you say so many things



(sung)

Dancing is a language that is felt instead of heard

You can whisper, sing or shout without so much as a word

Try it, go on, like so...



Just let your emotions tell your body what to do

See how much a single gesture can reveal!

And ev'ry little step

Ev'ry single step

Is one step closer

To saying what you feel



Once the music hits you, inhibitions fall away

And you find that you're expressing things

Your voice daren't say

Don't be afraid, let go!



Soon as you surrender, what's inside will sweep on through

As the boundaries between us disappear!

And ev'ry little step

Ev'ry single step

Is one step closer

To talking loud and clear



A dance is like a conversation

Except you never need to make a sound

And once you've begun

You speak as one

Give and take

Back and forth

Round and round



A dance is like a conversation

Except your lips don't ever need to part

And once you've begun

You speak as one

Cheek to cheek

Toe to toe

Heart to heart



Dancing is a language that is felt instead of heard

But it says much more than language ever could

And ev'ry little step

Ev'ry single step

Is one step closer...

One step closer...

One step closer

To being understood
