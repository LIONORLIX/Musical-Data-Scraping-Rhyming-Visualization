SEA CREATURES AND SERVANTS

Ahhhh



ALL

And now at last

Love has surpassed

Each tribulation

Mermaid and Man

Finally can

Join and be one

Now they can smile

Walking the aisle

Here at their

Wedding Celebration



ERIC

Sailing forward



ARIEL

Standing steady



ARIEL AND ERIC

Starting life

Completely ready



ALL

Now they can be who their meant to be

Now they can gaze on a new horizon

Here between ocean and sky

Forever and on!

Now they can walk

Now they can run

Now they can stay all day in the sun



ERIC

Just you and me



ARIEL

And I will be



ALL

Part of your world!
