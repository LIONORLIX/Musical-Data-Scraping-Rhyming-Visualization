Beyond My Wildest Dreams


ARIEL

Oh! Just look!

It's like I'm in a storybook!

Oh! It's bliss!

I dreamed that it would be

Somewhat-

But not

Like this!



Look over there!

Oh my god!

How very odd!

And what might they be?

Something splendid, maybe!



Look over here!

Could you bust?

Isn't it just

Bedazzling, dazing

Utterly amazing!

Gazing 'round, it's like, to die!

Just seeing it feels so good

I'd scream if I only could!



I'd hoped and wished

And wanted so to be here

Wished and prayed

And planned it to a "t"

Prayed and wow!

Just look - it's really me here!

Walking around, strange as it seems

Somewhere beyond my wildest dreams!



MAID 1

Look at her there

Looking 'round

Won't make a sound



MAID 2

Just keeps on gawking-

Weird how she's not talking!



MAID 3

Look at her stare



MAID 4

Lucky miss!



MAID 3

Chosen like this

To stay for dinner



MAID 4

What does he see in her?



CARLOTTA

Hush now, girls - she's simply shy!



MAIDS

Hmmph!



MAIDS 3 & 4

Just picture the table chat!



MAIDS 1 & 2

One sided, if even that!



ARIEL

I'd hoped and wished

And wondered what I'd do here

Wished and prayed

And pictured what I'd see

Prayed and wow!



My prayers are coming true here!

Look at it all, look how it gleams!

Lovely beyond my wildest dreams...



Look - it's him!

SO handsome and refined and slim

Sweet, sincere

Magnificent from head to toe

And oh...



I'd hoped and wished

My life would feel enchanted!

Wished and prayed

The fates would hear my plea

Prayed and wow!

MY prayers are more than granted!

Look at it all, hall after hall

Perfect as you could please here!

Marvels galore, and even more

Gee, did I mention *he's* here?

And if - who knows? - all of it goes

Past even these extremes

Just look at me and you will see

Someone beyond her wildest dreams!
