If Only (Reprise)


ARIEL (Spoken):

I've caused you so much trouble. Can you ever forgive me?



KING TRITON (Spoken):

Why, I've never been prouder. Somehow, in the blink of an eye when my back was turned, you grew up.



(Sung)

If only you could stay

And never say goodbye

If only I could make time stop

Believe me, I would try

But fathers have to learn

Their daughters have to grow

And if you truly love them

You must let them go...



ARIEL:

And oh, I love you so

If only you could know!



KING TRITON (Spoken):

You love him very much, don't you?

You belong to his world now.
