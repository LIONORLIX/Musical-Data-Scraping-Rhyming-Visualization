Poor Unfortunate Souls


[URSULA, spoken]

My dear, sweet child--it's what I live for:  to help unfortunate merfolk like yourself.

Poor souls with no one else to turn to. . .



I admit that in the past I've been a nasty

They weren't kidding when they called me, well, a witch

But you'll find that nowadays

I've mended all my ways

Repented, seen the light, and made a switch

True? Yes.



And I fortunately know a little magic

It's a talent that I always have possessed

And here lately, please don't laugh

I use it on behalf

Of the miserable, the lonely, and depressed

(Pathetic!)



Poor unfortunate souls

In pain, in need

This one longing to be thinner

That one wants to get the girl

And do I help them?

Yes, indeed!



Those poor unfortunate souls

So sad, so true

They come flocking to my cauldron

Crying, "Spells, Ursula, please!"

And I help them

Yes I do!



Now, it's happened once or twice

Someone couldn't pay the price

And I'm afraid I had to rake 'em 'cross the coals

Yes, I've had the odd complaint

But on the whole I've been a saint

To those poor unfortunate souls



[URSULA, spoken]

Here's my best offer, babykins.  I know a spell that will turn you into a human for three days.  Now, it's got a procedural clause, sort of a "squid pro quo."  Before the sun sets on the third day, you've got to get dear ol' princey to kiss you.  If you do, you'll stay human forever.



[ARIEL, spoken]

And if I don't?



[URSULA, spoken]

Nothing drastic, darling, I'm sure. . . Oh, look--small print:  "Your soul is mine forever, and you're doomed to spend eternity in my watery, hell-soaked lair."  Lawyers!  Don't you just love 'em?  Of course, there is one more thing. . . my fee.



[ARIEL, spoken]

But I don't have anything!



[URSULA, spoken]

I'm not askin' for much, Only. . . your voice.



[ARIEL, spoken]

My voice? But if I give away my voice, how can I ever--



[URSULA]

You'll have your looks. . . your pretty face. . . and don't underestimate the power of body language!



The men up there don't like a lot of blabber

They think a girl who gossips is a bore!

Yet on land it's much preferred for ladies not to say a word

And after all, dear, what is idle prattle for?



Come on, they're not all that impressed with conversation

True gentlemen avoid it when they can

But they dote and swoon and fawn

On a lady who's withdrawn

It's she who holds her tongue who gets a man



Come on you poor unfortunate soul

Go ahead!

Make your choice!

I'm a very busy woman

And I haven't got all day

It won't cost much

Just your voice!



You poor unfortunate soul

It's sad, but true

If you want to cross the bridge, my sweet

You've got the pay the toll

Take a gulp and take a breath

Go ahead and sign the scroll!

Flotsam, Jetsam--now I've got her, boys

The boss is on a roll

You poor unfortunate soul!



Beluga, sevruga, come winds of the Caspian Sea. . .

Larynxes, glaucitis, ad max laryngitis, la voce to me!



Now, sing!  Sing your voice over to me!



[ARIEL]

Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah...



[URSULA]

Sing and keep singing!



[ARIEL]

. . .ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah....



[URSULA]

Now swim, swim, swim!  Swim for your life, human child!

Ha ha ha. . .
