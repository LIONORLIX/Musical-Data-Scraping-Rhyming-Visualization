Sweet Child (Reprise)


FLOTSAM

(spoken) She may have legs, but her love affair doesn't!



JESTAM

(spoken) I didn't feel any sparks, did you?



FLOTSAM

(spoken) [laughs] No electricity whatsoever!



JESTSAM

(spoken) What's the poor sweet child to do?



FLOTSAM

It's such a shame



JETSAM

It's such a crime



FLOTSAM

To be so close



JETSAM

and yet so far



FLOTSAM

So overdue



JETSAM

yet underpar



FLOTSAM

So out of time



JETSAM

It's too sublime



BOTH

Sweet Child!



JETSAM

Poor child



FLOTSAM

And now her second sun has set!



JETSAM

Dear child!



FLOTSAM

Lost child!



JETSAM

There's still some hope-



FLOTSAM

Ya wanna bet?



JETSAM

No.



FLOTSAM

One more day to get her lovepeck



JETSAM

One more day to snag her man



BOTH

And then the squid will hit the fan



FLOTSAM

(spoken) She'll be disgraced



JETSAM

(spoken)Ugh Debased



FLOTSAM

Reviled



BOTH

Poor child...!
