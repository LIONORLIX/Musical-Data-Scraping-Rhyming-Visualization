Daughters of Triton


MERSISTERS

Ah, we are the daughters of Triton,

great father who loves us and named us well

Aquata, Andrina, Arista, Atina, Adella, Allana, and Ariel

In concert we hope to enlighten

the hearts of the merfolk with music's swell

Aquata...

Andrina...

Arista...

Atina...

Adella...

Allana...

And then there is the youngest in her musical debut

Our seventh little sister

we're presenting her to you

to sing a song Sebastian wrote

Her voice is like a bell

She's our sister, Ariel!



SEBASTIAN

Oh no! Where is she? Once more...



MERSISTERS

Sister, Ariel!
