Poor Unfortunate Souls (Reprise)


KING TRITON

Ursula!



URSULA

Brother darling! You're right on cue.



KING TRITON

Give Ariel back to me!



URSULA

Not on your life!



It so happens that your daughter signed a contract



KING TRITON

No!



URSULA

Even drew a little heart above the "i"

Is it binding? Goodness, yes!

Unbreakable, unless...



KING TRITON

Unless?



URSULA

There is a little somethin' we could try



KING TRITON

Go on



URSULA

Yes...

Perhaps we can arrange a sort of tradeoff



KING TRITON

What?



URSULA

Maybe swap your daughter's soul for, say, your own

Sing the scroll and set her free

Or else she comes with me

To suffer through eternity alone...



The mute little hatchling, drowning in her own sorrow, with no voice left to cry out your name... Well? I'm waiting.



KING TRITON

It's not my soul you're after-it's my power.



URSULA

Which would you rather be?

The King of the Sea... or a father to his little girl? Finally! The oceans belong to me!



And now you poor unfortunate soul!

Time's up! You're through!



Now the power of Poseidon

Has been once again made whole

All the magic of the trident

And the shell in my control!



And now dark shall reign forever

Over ocean, sea and shoal!



Now see for yourselves how banishment feels!



You poor unfortunate souls!
