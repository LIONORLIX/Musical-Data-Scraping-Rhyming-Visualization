Marie Is Tricky


(Gunshot. Sirens blare. Visual pandemonium.

Curtains fly in. All the women, minus Queenie,

Sing and dance)



Chorines

Queenie was a blonde and her age stood still

And she danced twice a day in the vaudeville.

She lived at present with a man named Burrs

whose act came on just after hers

he was comical as sin

he was comical as hell

a gesture, a grin,

and the house would yell?



(Burrs, in blackface, comes hurling onstage)



Burrs:

(coon-shouting, a la Al Jolson)



Marie is tricky

Sly and sticky

Brudda, you watch out for dat gal:

She gwina lub-ya like dere?s no tomorr-ah

But come tomorr-ah ya gots plenty of sarr-ah?



I tole Marie, I said, I lub-ya-I-lub-ya-I-lub-ya!

She said I  lub ya too! I?d lub ya

to up and die and leaves allah-ya money to me!



She gwina lub-ya like dere?s no tomorr-ah

But come tomorr-ah ya gots plenty of?



I tole Marie, I said, I lub-ya-I-lub-ya-I-lub-ya!

She said I  lub ya too. An? da ice man

An? da milkman an? da eggman!

Hatchitzidee!



(curtains lift to reveal painted

Scenery; Queenie and Burrs? bedroom)



Chorines

Studio;

Bedroom;

Bath;

Kitchenette:

Furnished like a third act passion set:

Oriental;

Sentimental;

They owed two months on the rental.



Sunday noon

Broiling hot

Queenie woke up

feeling shot



the Sunday tabloid

was well supplied

with



Chorines (Solos)

Murder

Rape

And Suicide!

Queenie woke up

Unsatisfied
