A Wild, Wild Party


EVE (QUEENIE)

God has said:



GOD (MAX)

"Don't eat that apple, child,

It's bad, forbidden fruit.



OSCAR & PHIL

Bad, forbidden fruit.



GOD (MAX)

That's right.



EVE (QUEENIE)

God has said:



GOD (MAX)

"Don't break my laws

Or give me cause

To use my boot."



OSCAR & PHIL

Don't go that route.



GOD (MAX)

That's what I said.



EVE (QUEENIE)

I misunderstood him

Or maybe I forgot

Cause after just one bite:

Ooh!

What a night.

Cool Paradise turned hot!



We were having a wild, wild party

We were loving it loud and fast

We were having a wild, wild party

And hoping the beer would last.

Adam, help me now!



ADAM & EVE (BURRS & QUEENIE)

We were driving it fast and funky

We were dancing and running free

We were having a wild, wild party



EVE (QUEENIE)

And all because of that tree!



THE TREE (EDDIE)

A wild, wild, wild party.



OSCAR

Chapter next!



PHIL

Sodom and Gomorrah

That seedy, greedy den

Got said to Abraham:



GOD (MAX)

"Go find me righteous men!"



OSCAR

Abie went

To find one gent



PHIL

And he could guess

Those folks were less than glad he was sent.



OSCAR

For when the Boss came down



PHIL & OSCAR

They were burning up the town.



PHIL & OSCAR SODOMITES

They were having a wild, wild party Indeed!

They were loving it loud and fast Such speed!

They were having a wild, wild party

And hoping the beer would last.



OSCAR

Hey, what's on tap?



PHIL & OSCAR SODOMITES

They were driving it fast and funky Wa ooh!

They were doin' it to a fault So true!

They were having a wild, wild party



GOD (MAX)

Until that woman turned to salt!



QUEENIE, OSCAR & PHIL

Heaven watched us tearing up the joint

Heaven, ever slowly, got the point



QUEENIE

Moses, coming down from the mount

What's that I hear you say?



PHIL

Holy, Moses, down from the mount

Been workin' a-forty day.



QUEENIE, OSCAR & PHIL

Your people wandered from the Word

Now how did this begin?



MOSES (BURRS)

I was so in shock

They made me drop my rock



ISRAELITES

Well, Moe - what was their sin?



MOSES ISRAELITES

They were having a wild, wild party Baruch haba -

They were dancing and living free Baruch atah -

They were having a wild, wild party



MOSES (Burrs)

And not a soul invited me.



QUEENIE, OSCAR & PHIL

So don't you see

That's the way it was meant to be



BURRS

From chapter one



QUEENIE

To one hundred thirty-three.



QUEENIE, BURRS, OSCAR & PHIL

If in Heaven you don't excel

You can always party down in Hell!



OSCAR & PHIL

Then finally -



ALL

We'll be having a wild, wild party

We'll be loving it loud and fast

We'll be having a wild, wild party

And hoping the beer would last.



We'll be having a wild, wild party

We'll be loving it loud and fast

We'll be having a wild, wild party

And hoping the beer would last.



We'll be driving it fast and funky

We'll be dancing in primordial stew

Such a wonderful wild, wild party

And we're inviting you!



QUEENIE, BURRS, OSCAR & PHIL

And we're inviting you!
