What A Party


OFFSTAGE VOICES

And the gang took wing,

And the shadows leapt,

Any fool could see -

What a party.



ENSEMBLE

And the gang took wing,

And the shadows leapt,

Any fool could see -

What a party.



While the candles glared

And the neighbors wept

Any swell could be

At a party.



Lightly,

Quickly,

Slightly sickly

Pasty,

Tasty,

Like birds of prey

'Round the hors d'oeuvre tray.



When the laughter starts

And the game begins

You can guarantee

That's how to blow

That's how to grow

That how to throw a party!



(The guests enter, one by one.)

ALL

Crazy,

Crowded,

Smartly shrouded.

Drinking,

Stinking,

Till by and by

They began to fly.

BURRS & ENSEMBLE

Oooh:

And the gang took wing,

And the clock ticked on

Any fool could see,

What a party.



For the mood could swing

When the blues got gone

While the booze was free

At a party.



Panting,

Prying,

Loudly lying,

Raving,

Craving

Like birds of prey

'Round the hors d'oeuvre tray -



(Queenie appears, dressed all in white.)



BURRS

But tonight,

Queenie surpassed them all,

And tonight,

Queenie stood firm and tall.



ENSEMBLE

With a face of ivory,

And gold for hair.



BURRS

She was something

To kneel before in prayer.

My God,

Queenie,

You're looking swell.



ENSEMBLE

Quoth Queenie
