The Movin' Uptown Blues


Gold

What do you remember’



Goldberg

I remember walking through the front

Door and saying, ‘Great party.’ (speaks

In Yiddish). And I can’t find my pants.





Goldberg

Can’t find my shoes

Ain’t seein’ straight



Gold

Don’t know the time

But I think it’s too late



Goldberg

Don’t know how I got here

Don’t know where I am



Gold

Forgot my name



Goldberg

Must be the booze



Gold

If I hadta name what I feel right now

I’d call it

‘The Movin’ Uptown Blues.’



Goldberg

We did too much too soon, so what

Everybody does



The city’s full of guys like us

Forgetting who they was



Gold

I think I ran a deli once



Goldberg

I think I had a wife



Gold & Goldberg

Walked in that door tonight and wham ‘

I’m living someone else’s life ‘

Don’t got a past

Don’t got a name

Can’t go back to

From wherever I came

Whole room’s spinning crazy

Someone make it stop



(Dolores appears)



Dolores

A promise made in the throes of passion

Is a promise to be kept. Violate that

Promise and the terrible things can happen.

Hell hath no fury like a woman’per-

former’legend scorned.



(she exits)



Goldberg

I need my pants



Gold

I need my shoes

Tomorrow we’ll be sober men



Goldberg

And Jewless Jews



Gold

Gold and Golden’



Goldberg

Gold and Golden.



Gold & Goldberg

Tonight we’re lost in

‘The Movin’ Uptown Blues’
