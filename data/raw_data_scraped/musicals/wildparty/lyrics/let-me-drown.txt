Let Me Drown


BURRS

And now, ladies and gentlemen,

The moment you've all been waiting for:

The clown takes the center ring!



I've changed my mind

Let the evening rage ahead

By tomorrow morning we could be dead drunk

Or just dead.



If she won't talk to me I've plenty else to do

I'll talk to you

And you and you and you and

I think we're due for a :

I think we're due for a :

I think we're due for a :



You think I'm headed for disaster

You think I'm going up in flames

You wanna break my fall

You wanna stop them all from calling me names.



You'd like to chain me down in irons

You'd like to give me your support

But when you se me stand

Martini glass in hand

The rescue you've got planned

Must be aborted.



Let me drown, this evening,

Let me drown

If I'm blue, let me truly play the clown

Let me sail

Let me sink

Let me teeter on the brink

Let me drown, drown, drown, drown, drown.



You'd like to see me at confession

You hope I learn from my mistakes

You wanna save my soul

But when I'm on a roll,

Lay off of the brakes



You think that when I meet my maker

(Hello, Maker!)

That cat'll be all dressed in red

But every morn I pray

That on that lucky day

I'll hear that devil say

"Son, pour it steady!"



BURRS KATE & MEN

And let me drown, this evening,

Let me drown

Whoa, let me drown!

If I'm low, let slowly paint the town

Go, grab a dollah

And follah me!

When they ask for the roof

Let me answer "Hundred Proof!"



Let me drown, drown, drown, drown, drown.

Drown, drown, drown, drown, drown.

Let me drown in females foreign

Let me dangle from a limb Ooooh...

Teach me how to put my oar in

But don't you dare to teach me

How to swim!



KATE ENSEMBLE

Let me drown, this evening, let me drown Let me drown!

If you smile

For a while

I'll wear the frown Go slap that happy face





BURRS

Let me go

Set me free I wanna run now



Let me at that S.O.B. KATE

No!



BURRS & ENSEMBLE

Let me drown, drown, drown, drown, drown

Let me drown, till daybreak,

Let me drown



BURRS ENSEMBLE

I'm the guy

Guy!

Who will buy

Her wedding gown

Here comes the bride.

BURRS & MEN

Till the dawn

Breaks the spell

All the world

Can got to hell

KATE & WOMEN

Now, where is my bible?

Strap me in

Let me ride

Till I'm on the other side

Take me to the other side

Let me rock

Let me roll Let me roll



BURRS

Let me sacrifice my soul



BURRS, KATE & ENSEMBLE

Let me drown,

Let me drown!
