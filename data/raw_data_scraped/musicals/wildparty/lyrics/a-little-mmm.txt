A Little Mmm


Brothers d’armano

If i’m up in harlem

Where the playboys play

And you’re out slummin’

Till the break of day

Who cares if we misbehave’

Just as long as we know to save

A little mmm a

Lotta yummy yum for each other’



Kate

So queenie, what do you think of black’



Queenie

Who’



Kate

Queenie, you and i know that if any

Man who looked even half as good as

Black came knockin’ on your door, you’d

Be there with your undies at your ankles

Sayin’ ‘come on in.’



Brothers d’armano

If cook some cutie

At the cotton club

While you shoot some shank

With mister oil-and-rub

We won’t have a jealous bone;

Cuz we’ll manage when we’re alone

A little mmm a

Lotta yummy yum



Jackie

Bothers!



Brothers d’armano

Jackie!



Jackie

Don’t you ever get tired of each other’ [laughter]

But seriously day in day out, the

Same gestures, the same routines.





Phil

We’re happiest as a team.



Jackie

How about you oscar’ long to take a

Spin on someone else’s spinnette’ gotta

Run.



Phil

I’m no jack horner

And you’re no miss muffett

Can’t sit in a corner



With oscar

We two love to rough it.

But we’ll both be back in each other’s arms

Come morn’



Black

You friend queenie and that guy burrs,

Are they married or something’



Kate

You sound like you wanna go play.

Go on. But not matter what, we leave

Together



Brothers d’armano

If i’m sprung and spanky

On a cocaine hum

While you’re weird and wanky

Puffing opium

Whatever our cravings need

We’ll both have (aside from weed)

A little mmm

A lotta yummy yum for

Each other!
