Wouldn't It Be Nice?


Burrs

Fidelity is a virtue

Too many many many of you lack

Monogamy can exert you

Keeping track of what goes on

Behind your back

Would that your sugar could be trusted

Instead of busted

scrubbing someone else’s tub;

is it too much to ask-

is it such an awful task-

to be faithful’

Ah! There’s the rub’



Wouldn’t it be nice

Wouldn’t it be grand

To know your sweetie

Wasn’t squeezin’

someone else’s hand’

Wouldn’t it be nice

Wouldn’t it be good

To know your love

Had not made love

With half the neighborhood’



Oh! Hasn’t it been hell

Having no success

You wish your baby

knew more words than

‘open up’

and ‘yes!’



you can warn her once, but

then she’ll go and do it twice;

she’s everybody’s cherry pie-

but you don’t get a slice;



makes you wanna chain her up

And pack her down in ice-



[oh, but] That wouldn’t be nice

But wouldn’t it be nice



(music)



Oscar and Phil

What a thrill

But while Jackie’s fillin’ Oscar,

how does po’ Phil feel’



(music)



‘Sally Sally Sally, she’s all mine.’

I haven’t heard sally say ‘I love Ma-du-

line’



(music)



Eddie and Mae, ain’t love great’

Ya better watch out, he’s messin’ with

Kate.



Don’t it break your heart’

Aintcha got It rough’

You give your tootsie everything

But still it ain’t enough

All the same ya know

She’s gonna come around one day

She’ll vow to love and honor and obey

And never stray

You may be dead and buried by that time

But what the hey!

Hold out for paradise

Stock up on wedding rice

You gotta make her love ya’-

No matter what the price -

Couldn’t it be-

Shouldn’t it be-

Wouldn’t it be-

Nice---!

‘Hotchitzidee!’
