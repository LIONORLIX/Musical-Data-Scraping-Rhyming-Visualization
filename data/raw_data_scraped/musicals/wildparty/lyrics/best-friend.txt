Best Friend


(Kate, a dagger-tongued beauty and

Queenie’s best friend enters the party

With Black, her handsome escort)



Queenie

Lesson number three.  Keep your friends

Close, but your enemies even closer.



Nadine

Which is Kate’



Queenie

She’s a little bit pal



Kate

She’s a little bit foe



Queenie

She’s a little bit slick



Kate

she’s a little bit slow



Queenie

Who’s gorgeous to the cuticle’



Kate

Who’s looks ain’t pharmaceutical’



Queenie

I’m all this and she’s all that



Kate

She’s all dog and I’m all cat



Both

But underneath the fur and fat

You’re lookin’ at

my best friend



Kate

She’s a little bit stale



Queenie

She’s a little bit fresh



Kate

She’s a lotta bit ice



Queenie

She’s a lotta bit flesh.



Kate

I always do the mothering-



Queenie

But some would call it smothering-

Different as the day and night-



Kate

Opposite as wrong and right-



Both

Together we make dynamite

Hold on tight

For my best friend!



Kate

So you’re still shakin’ it down in the

Bowry. Ain’t they retired you yet’



Queenie

Too bad that all of that money you earn

You gotta spend on the love you can’t

Get.





Kate

What’ll be tonight’s special’ Let me guess:

‘Queenie In Distress’ again’



Queenie

Kate the icebox is jealous of me

and my nat’ral success with men



Kate

I calls it like I sees it-



Queenie

(She never tells the truth)



Kate

She’s a little bit dumb-



Queenie

She’s a little bit cold-



Kate

She’s a little soft-



Queenie

She’s a little hard-



Both

She’s a lotta luv-luvva-luvva-love ‘

She’s good for a bail,

I’m great for a laugh.

She’s my evil twin.

I’m her better half.



Queenie

She cuts through all the gin and jive-



Kate

She always makes me feel alive-



Both

Stickin’ through the blood and gore-

Call it love or civil war-

What we got is something more-

Thank heaven and hell for

My best friend!
