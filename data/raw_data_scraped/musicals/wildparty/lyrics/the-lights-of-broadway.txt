The Lights Of Broadway


(Jackie and Nadine sitting on the bed.

Dressed in one of Queenie’s outfits,

Nadine, under Jackie’s tutelage, has just

Done her fist line of cocaine)



Nadine

I always wanted to see the lights of Broadway

I always wanted to hear the traffic roar

I always wanted to be a part

Of New York City’s great big heart

And now I am ‘ I couldn’t ask for more’!

Can I have some more’



(Jackie obliges)



I always wanted to jingle with the right crowd

I always wanted to feel like I belong.

I wanna feel like all the big girls do;

All bright and fizzed and special too ‘

There’s nothing wrong with that ‘

There’s nothing wrong ‘ there’s nothing wrong ‘

There’s nothing wrong with Poughkeepsie

That living in Manhattan couldn’t fix

I’m just a kid in Poughkeepsie

But here a kid can get her grown-up kicks



(she laughs)



I always wanted to see the lights of Broadway;

And I was told that if I looked to close

I might just go blind.

But little sister’s loose

And she wants her share of juice;

If the lights of Broadway blind me

I don’t mind -!

Gimme some more.



Jackie

What did you just say’



Nadine

(throughty/determined)



I want some more.
