Eddie & Mae


(In different corners of the room, Eddie

Mackrel, a former heavyweight champ,

is talking to the men guests and Mae,

his dyed-blonde wife, is talking to the

woman guests)





Eddie

I usually go on just before the headliner and

always right after Piergo’s Trained Birds. And then

it’s ‘Ladies and Gentlemen-Eddie Mackrel. The

Champ!’ Course it ain’t nothing like the real thing.

Ain’t nothing like being in the ring.



Mae

My Eddie’s a hero just like Lindbergh. Except

Lindbergh’s white and flies a plane. My Eddie’s

colored and beats people up.



(she laughs)





Eddie

So I’m there in the ring

And the crowd starts to shout

I go in for the kill

And I knock the man out

And the referee barks-

It’s the end of the bout

And that’s the first time they called me

‘The Champ’



Yeah!

Those were the days

I ascended on high

Taking on the Golden Boy

O’Malley oh my.

Bye-by those were the years. And I

give ‘em plenty of reasons to call me

‘The Champ’.

The Women’

Anyone I wanted anyway-

Blondes and browns and women:

and then somehow. I was. One day’



Eddie and Mae. Champ’s gotta wife.

Got settled down gotta whole diff’rent life.

Can’t take the Golden Boy

on anymore:

it’s only on stage

I’m what I was before

Eddie and Mae

Eddie and Mae

Eddie and Mae-



Mae

So he gave me the ring

In Buffalo and girls, I’m glad I left the show-

I figure. One door opening is-

You know.

Life is a dream since I married

‘The Champ’. He plays the week and Saturdays

Three a night

Plus matinees

In Detroit the theater ran out an ‘A’s.

So the marquee read:

‘The Chomp’.



And Women’

They flock around him like hungry birds.

Jealous jealous women-

cuz my future lies in three little words:

Eddie and Mae!

Talk about bliss nobody’s got

It better than this.

So what I if I gave up

my place on the line

at least I got something

I call mine all mine



Mae

Eddie and Mae-

Eddie and Mae-

Eddie and Mae-

Eddie and Mae-



Eddie and Mae-



Ain’t we a team’



Happy as clams



Life is a dream!







Everything seems

Possible

Since I became

Eddie and Mae

Eddie and Mae

Eddie and Mae!  Eddie

Duck-

Jab-

Fake-

Left

He’s out-

Those were

the years

of my holy

fame

king of the hill



at the top of my game

the crowd going wild

at the sound of my

name-



before

I became

Eddie and Mae

Eddie and Mae

Eddie and Mae!
