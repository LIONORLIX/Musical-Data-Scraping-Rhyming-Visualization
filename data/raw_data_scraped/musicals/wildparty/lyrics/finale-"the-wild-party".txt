Finale "The Wild Party"


(Distant in the background, the sound of a

A victrola playing a scratchy old record-

ing of Burrs singing)



‘Marie is tricky

Sly and sticky

Brudda, you watch out for dat gal:

She gwina lub-ya like dere’s no tomorr-ah’



(the door to the room opens and a fig-

ure steps in. It’s Burrs. In blackface)



Burrs

But come tomorrah ya gots

Plenty ‘Sarrah...’

Hot-chitza-dee!



(as if in his Vaudeville act)



Queenie

Burrs, what are you doing’ Burrs put the

gun down.



Burrs

You whore. You fuckin’ whore. You’I

Loved you! I loved ‘



How many women in the world

Say ‘Okay it’ll do’

How many many many many many many

many Women’



(Burrs focuses all of his energy on

Queenie, completely oblivious to Black,

To anything else in the entire world)



You!



Queenie

Burrs, please.



Burrs

You!



Queenie

Please don’t do this.



Burrs

You!



Queenie

Burrs please



(Black charges at Burrs. They struggle,

The gun between them)



Black ‘



Queenie/Burrs/Black

Noooooo!



(gunshot. Burrs staggers away from

Black and falls onto the bed. As the

vaudeville swirls around her, Queenie

says goodbye to Burrs, Kate and Black.)



Company

Queenie was a blonde and her age stood still

And she danced twice a day in the vaudeville

So.

So.

Now you know



A fascinating woman

As they go

Queenie wazza wazza wazza

Queenie wazza wazza wazza

Queenie wazza wazza wazza ‘

Queenie



(as the vaudeville settles, Queenie finds

herself alone)



Queenie

Queenie wazza’

Blonde

In a vaudeville show’

And she hid what she was

With a mask of snow’



This is was it is to be lost

This is what it is to be scared

This is what it is ‘

This is what it is ‘



(voices add in, as Queenie begins to

remove her makeup)



Queenie





Love;

Hurt;

Good-

Bye;

This is what it is

To live in

Light.



Company

To lose what was

And long for more

And grasp at love

And breathe in hurt

And leave the night

And say goodbye

(Queenie steps into the morning light)
