Lowdown-Down


Queenie

(to black)



Some are born for higher things

Like hitchin’ Up to uptown kings:

I was born for iron beds and bums.

Well alrighty then

That’s the lowdown-down.

Swim with sharks in shallow pools

you get bit and them’s the rules.

I got bit and almost eaten whole.

But i liked it, yeah.

That’s the lowdown-down



Some get good at trafficking in souls.

I got good at rollin’ With the rolls.

Some get given everything they need.

Well, that’s a lucky break;

I steal what i can take and i roll.

And i plead and i duck- oh hey,

And i bleed.



Some are born to rise above

Sleepless nights and sloe-gin love-love-love;

i was born to ask: ‘why was i born’’

And the answer is:



Get me some more ice, will ya’



(she holds out her glass. He doesn’t take

It)



Small town girl she comes to town;

Tin of rouge and strapless gown;

Does a lot before she gets to die.

But with a smile she’ll say:

‘That’s the lowdown-down’’



(as burrs looks on, black crosses to

Kiss queenie as burrs looks on)
