How Did We Come To This?/Queenie Was A Blonde (Reprise)


QUEENIE

We're all so sure

We're all so wise

No limits

No boundaries

No compromise.

Laughing at our neighbor

Smiling through a hiss

How did we come to this?



We're all amuse

We're al inspired

So cunning

So clever

And so admired

Easy to be angry

Easy to dismiss

How did we come to this?



Maybe I've been living in a daydream

Maybe I've been talking in my sleep

If I've been awake

Pardon my mistake

But time is running low

And talk is growing cheap.



We play our games

We place our bets

No witness

No weakness

And no regrets.

Filling up with frenzy

Killing with a kiss

How did we all come to this?



Time goes by

Plans grow stale

People die

And parties fail

How did we come to this?



ENSEMBLE

She had grey eyes,

Lips like coals aglow.

And her face was a tinted mask of snow.



A fascinating woman

As they go.
