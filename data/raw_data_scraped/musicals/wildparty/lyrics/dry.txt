Dry


Jackie

Don’t gimme no seltzer

Cuz I need more than fizz:

Don’t gimme no water

I don’t know what that is:

Don’t gimme no lemon

And ask me to squeeze-



(Madeline and Sally enter)



Madeline

I’m beggin’ you please

Don’t lemme go dry.



(Eddie/May and Nadine enter)



Eddie/Mae/Nadine

Don’t gimme no grape juice

Cuz that don’t got no sting

I need a concoction

To make the tongue-tied sing:

It’s time to be happy,

The day has been mourned-



Guests

Awright you been warned:

Don’t lemme go?



(Phil and Oscar, the Brothers

D’Armano, enter)



Brothers

Dry:



Guests

That is the law of the land



Brothers

We gotta be

Dry:



Guests

All day we’ve plotted and planned



Brothers

How not to be

Dry:



Guests

And now the nighttime is here

And I wanna night I won’t forget

So you gotta make it wild ‘n’ wet



(Dolores enters)



Company with Dolores

Don’t gimme no root beer

Cuz I need more than foam:

Don’t gimme no Jell-O

I’d rather die at home:

Don’t gimme no coffee



Dolores

Unless it’s time to leave-



Guests

Pour me a cup

When it’s time to sober up.

But to come down

I’ve got to get high-

Don’t lemme go don’t lemme go lemme go



Phil

Dry-



Phil & Oscar

Dry-



Phil, Oscar, Jackie

Dry-



(the drop rises to reveal Queenie and

Burr’s apartment)



Guests

Dry-Dry

Dry-Dry-Dry!
