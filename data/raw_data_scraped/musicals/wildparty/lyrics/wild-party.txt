Wild Party


(we see Queenie lying in bed.

Though the domestic «drama» which unfolds

Is informed by real emotions- it is

Performed stylistically, as if it were a vaudeville skit)





Queenie

Queenie is so»(yawn)»ah well.

She»s awful awful tired.

She needs her cup of java

So Queenie can get wired.



Burrsie»



Queenie is so stretches oh my

Can»t lift a singly toe.

Her blood»s as thick as lava

Mama needs her cuppa joe.



Burrsie»



(Burrs enters)



Burrs

A woman who sleeps till half past two

Then wakes up tired

Whadddya do with a woman who sleeps

Like the stone-deaf dead---

Needs a kick in the ass

Or a smack in the head---





Queenie

Burrsie! Pour me a cup of coffee.



Burrs

(exploding)

The hell I will you lazy slut!

You think you»re the Prince of Whales» Or what»



(Queenie ignores Burrs)



Well»! Queenie! QUEENIE.



(as music blares, Burrs grabs

Queenie and pulls her into her bed,

Kissing her. A struggle ensues. Queenie

Breaks free, he goes chasing after her

with a shoe, she grabs a knife.

All motion abruptly stops- the vaudeville

Of their marriage has turned into something

Dangerous, deadly)





Queenie

You touch me- I»ll kill you, you filthy bastard.



(a beat)



Burrs

Don't I know what baby needs?

Oh, I know what baby needs.

Don't I know what»s best for you?

Sure I know what»s best for you.

Don»t I know how baby thinks?

Don»t I understand»

Don»t I know you better

Than the palm of your own hand

Don»t I know you»re gonna love

What Daddy has got planned?

Whanna know what I got planned?



Gin.

Skin.

Sin.

Fun.

Howzzabout a wild party



Tonight



Queenie

Tonight.

Put out the news we got a hot party

Put out the word and go an order the ice.

We sure could use a little fun, Lover.

When was the last time I wore my «new» backless

When was the last time you smiled»

When was the last time we have a real party?

Wet and wicked, fast-time fun

And wild!



Burrs

What do you mean by fun?



Queenie

You»re the clown. you figure it out.





Burrs

I think we»re due for a wild party

The time is right to toss a huge she-bang

Say me and you we throw a wild party

We»ll round up all the old gang.



Queenie

And maybe some new blood»ll

Turn up to play ball.



Burrs

We could always use new skin



Queenie

I could always use someone fresh

And tan and thin-



Burrs

We»re outta Gin-



Queenie

You in»



Burrs

I»m in.

Go fix your face we gotta get ready.

Pick out the music you wanna hear.





Both

Let»s give this place a little life, Lover



Queenie

When was the last time I danced the Black Bottom?



Burrs

You»re not gettin» any younger, my child.



Both

When was the last time we had a real party?

Last year

Last month

Yesterday

But one that will never be as wild?

Wild!
