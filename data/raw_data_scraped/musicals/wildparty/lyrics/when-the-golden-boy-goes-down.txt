When The Golden Boy Goes Down


Eddie

When the Golden Boy goes down

Hell, the crowd they get mean,

Can’t believe what they’ve seen,

Can’t be true.

When the Golden Boy goes down

Fate steps up with a crunch

Lands a dirty left punch

And you’re lunch for the newspapers ‘

Give us a smile boy!

You’re the pride of your race!

- Hey wait, use the back door.

Remember your place.

You can look at the white girls, sure;

But Champ, don’t you touch.

When the Golden Boy went down,

Did I feel like a hero’

Not much’



(Phil/Oscar intone a vocalise, fueled by

Resignation, forgiveness and regret)



Phil

Mmmm’





Oscar

Who cares if we misbehave



Phil

M-m-m



Oscar

M-m-m



Phil

We won’t have a jealous bone



Oscar

M-m-m. a little h-m-m.



Both

And we’ll both be back in each other’s arms

Come morn

M-m-m-m-m-m-m-m



Eddie

When the Golden Boy went down

Did I feel like a hero’

Not much’

Not much’



(as Eddie/Mae and Oscar/Phil kiss,

Sally wanders until she finds Gold and

Goldberg sitting at the kitchen table, in

Partial status if undress, very drunk and

Very lost)
