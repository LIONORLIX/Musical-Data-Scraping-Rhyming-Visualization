(Queenie and black standing on the fire

Escape to the apartment)



Queenie

This city. So many lights you can actually

Pretend one of ‘em is shining on you.



Always wanted to see the lights of broadway

I always wanted to see the traffic roar.

I always wanted to be a part

Of new york city’s great big heart

And now i am. I couldn’t ask for’

I was that girl, i’m all of them. Trapped in

A room full of shadows and not enough

Light. And soon we will fade away, into

The walls, into nothingness. The end.



Black

People like us: we get through the day

Surviving the city way better than most.

We go through the motions

From nightcap to nightcap:

Here but not here.

With the heart of a ghost.

people like us: we meet up some night

In a room full of strangers who call themselves

Friends:

It feels like a dream

But it’s too hard to tell

Where the dream begins

And the real world ends ‘

And where - where do we belong’

We might ask ourselves:

Where ‘ Where do we belong’

People like us:

Private stock.

Where’



Queenie

People like us. We take lovers like pills.

Just hoping to cure what we know we can’t fix.

And we’ll lay in their arms

And we’ll say pretty things:

But we’ll still get our kicks:

And we heal awful fast and we don’t even scar:

We are here but not here

In a roomful of friends

We could join the fray

Or stay here where we are --



And where ‘ Where do we belong’



Do we need to ask ourselves

Where ‘ Where do we belong’



People like us:

Damaged goods. Where’   Black

Where’





Where’





Where’



Black

We dance alone on a crowded floor.



Queenie

We weren’t given much.



Black

And we don’t expect much more’



Queenie

- ‘More’ Is not a word we use.



Black

‘More’ Would never be enough.



Both

People like us: we slip through the cracks

We’ll never be famous. So who’s gonna care’

Nobody needs us

And everyone’s had us ‘

We’re here but not here:

We’ve been there but not there ‘

And where ‘ Where do we belong’

We only have ourselves.

Were ‘ Where do we belong’



Queenie

People like us.

Lost.





Black

And found.



Both

Where’’

Where’’



(black gently kisses her. We see the

Aftermath of the orgy. Slowly, sally,

Naked-from-the-waist up, emerges from

The sea of bodies, and for the first time

All evening, actually sees where she is)
