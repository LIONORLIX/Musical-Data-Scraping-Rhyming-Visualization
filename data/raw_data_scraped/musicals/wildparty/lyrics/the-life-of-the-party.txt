The Life Of The Party


KATE

Who needs money?

Not me.

Who needs fortune or fame?

I don't need a new career

A sympathetic ear

A name.



All I need is time to pay

Only want the game

Point me to the mike

I know what I like.



Don't you wanna be

The life of the party?

Don't you wanna be

The cream of the crop?

Don't you wanna feel those shivering fits

'Til someone calls it quits

Or someone calls a cop?



Don't you wanna land

The role of a lifetime?

Well, you better get down on one knee

'Cause you could play the life of the part

If you can pray with me.



Who needs lovers?

Not I.

Who needs Heaven above?

Don't have time for things unsaid

For baking bread

For love.



All I need is room to fight

Hand in fisted glove.

Point me to the sky,

It's my turn to fly.



Don't you wanna be

The life of the party?

Don't you wanna be

The top of the heap?

This is where the jamboree never ends

Why not be counting friends

Instead of counting sheep?



If you wanna join

The Heavenly Choir

Hurry up and get yourself in line.

But don't you pass the life of the party

Until you pass the wine.



Let the drinks pour

Let the crowds roar

Let the Heavens wildly cheer.



'Til the sunrise

Brings the goodbyes

I'll be here.

Never fear.



Who's it gonna be,

The life of the party?

Who's it gonna be,

The king of the hill?

Don't you wanna be there

Running the show

Until it's time to go

Or 'til it's time to kill?



Don't you ever wanna be

Somebody to envy

Don't you wanna be

Footloose and free?

Well, you could be the life of the party

If you

Were

More

Like me!
