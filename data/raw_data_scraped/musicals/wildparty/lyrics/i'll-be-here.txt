I'll Be Here


BLACK

When you cry

I can hold you

When you fall

Shed no tear



When you lose your light

In the naked night

I'll be here

I'll be here



When you fail

I can soothe you

No more harm

No more fear

On the coldest climb

To the end of time

I'll be here

I'll be here



I'll be standing by

Trying to comfort

Hoping I am enough

I'll be flying high

Crying myself into happiness

I've never known

A life I thought I'd never own.



Maybe I've been dreaming

And this moment isn't real.

How else can I explain

This power that I feel?



You can run

I'll forgive you

I'm the one

You can call



I will need you

I will feed you

I will lead you to the clear

I'll be here

I'll be here.
