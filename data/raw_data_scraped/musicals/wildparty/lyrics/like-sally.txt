Like Sally


(Queenie and Nadine meet up with

Madeline True, stripper, and her date

Sally, who sits motionless-a functional

catatonic)



Queenie

So, when’d you meet this one?



Madeline

Two nights ago. And from the moment

our eyes met, we knew we were meant

to be together.



I need somebody with spunk.

I need somebody with the lust for danger

I need somebody who likes sex

Impulsively

I need somebody like me;

Like Sally.



(Sally starts to nod out)



Sally! Sally! Sally!

This woman here inspired Hemingway

And Stravinsky.

And the man who invented Vaseline.

This woman here inspires me to genius;

Tonight I’m breaking in a whole new routine:



(Madeline performs a portion of her

Striptease)



Art is my clothing?

Modernism is dead?

I made Alice B. Toklas-cry!

We all need someone like this:

This perfect specimen of style plus substance.

This brilliant mind who sees the world

They way I do.



You need somebody like you

I got somebody like me;

Like me like me

Like sally!
