This Is What It Is


Queenie

The stars are gone

Slipped outta sight

I oughta follow them

Into the night.



But here is good

Feels almost right

Don’t call it love, yet

Just call it:

Light.



This is what it is

To wake up, yeah

This is what it is

To feel warm, yeah

This is what it is

To be filled, sure

This is what it is

To be lost ‘ Help

This is what it is



To be scared ‘ God

This is what it is ‘

This is what it is ‘

To know the day

And meet the sun

And find that i am not

The only one

I am not

The only one

Who’s afraid of a world too big

And bright



This is what it is

To live in’
