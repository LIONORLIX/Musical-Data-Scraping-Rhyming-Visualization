Maybe I Like It This Way


QUEENIE

I know it's wrong

I know he's rough

I don't know what to do

But we've been through enough

I know it's time

And yet I play

Maybe I like it this way.



I see his pain

I hear his cry

He pulls me to the edge

But I don't ask him why

I understand

And I obey

Maybe I like it this way.



I like the way he laughs

His strange and silent stare

I like the way he moves

The way he's always there

The way he calls my name

The way he takes control

I like the way this man has stirred my soul:



"When I first met Burrs, he was grand. You understand?

But I was scared and awfully lonely.

Hungry. And hopeful. How could I know?"



Maybe tomorrow it comes crashing down

Maybe next week I'll find another clown

Maybe I'll try to go a different way

But look who's sitting here today.



If I could change

If I could grow

I'd ask for nothing more

And through that door I'd go

But if I'm through

Why do I stay?



Maybe he wants me

Maybe he needs me

Maybe he loves me

Maybe I like it this way.
