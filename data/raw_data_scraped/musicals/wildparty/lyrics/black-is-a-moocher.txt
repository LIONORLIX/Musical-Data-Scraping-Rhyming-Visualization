Black Is A Moocher


Kate

Black is a moocher

And I like it like that

Three-pocket-poocher

And I like it like that

I like him the way that he is’

He is no’innocent

And Christ. He’s guilty where it counts

I use him daily in increasin’ amounts

And I like it like that

Un-huh Un-huh Un-huh Un-huh

And I like it like that

Mmmhm mmmhm’

I like it like ‘

In the morning light when he rubs his beard

Then he touches me;

In the afternoon. when he draws my bath

Then undresses me:

Come round curtain time; when he spends my

Dough

Then he cheats on me;

Come the quarter-moon; when he drinks

Too much

Then he cries for me:

Breaking a stray in ain’t so hard;

Had ta teach him to play in my backyard



Black is a liar

And I like it like that

Thinks with his wire

And I like it like that

I’m in for the thrill of the kill’

If I can’t have him ‘

Then nobody will.



All

I need what I need



Kate

I need to feel his touch ‘



All

I need I need



Kate

I need to feel his sex ‘



All

I need to feel your sex

I need to hear your name

I need your fire

I need your breath

I need your lust

Lust!

Lust!

Lust!

The above couplings lie intertwined)
