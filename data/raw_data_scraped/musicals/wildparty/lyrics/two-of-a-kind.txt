Two Of A Kind


EDDIE

It's hard to describe my feelings

But I'll try.



MAE

He's gonna try.



EDDIE

It's hard to express my :wonder!



MAE

He's wondering: "Why?"



EDDIE

She's really so wonderful, so --



MAE

Short?



EDDIE

No - petite.

Yet so complete.



MAE

Now ain't he sweet?



EDDIE

We're two of a kind

A perfect pair

A knockout in the ring



MAE

We're two of a kind

Why should we care

If we don't own a thing?



EDDIE

She's a one-two punch



MAE

He's a catered lunch



EDDIE

She's a melon on the rind



MAE

He's one of the good guys



BOTH

And we're two of a kind



MAE

Show 'em your muscles



EDDIE

Nah.



MAE

Show 'em your muscles!



EDDIE (obliging)

Huh!



MAE

Oooh!

It's hard to express how happy

I feel inside



EDDIE

She feels inside!



MAE

But he'll be my sugar pappy -

Sweetheart?



EDDIE

My buttered bride!



MAE

He's really so wonderful, so --



EDDIE

Brute?



MAE

No - astute.

He makes me toot.



EDDIE

If that ain't cute:



BOTH

We're two of a kind

A perfect match

A couple through and through

We're two of a kind



EDDIE

The catcher



MAE

The catch



BOTH

A fairy tale come true.



MAE

He's a motor car



EDDIE

She's an oyster bar



MAE

Just the way that God designed



EDDIE

She's two feet below me



MAE

But we're two of a kind



BOTH

Why look for substitutions

You'll never fine?

We're happy together

Being just two of a kind



EDDIE

One -



MAE

Two -



BOTH

I love you!
