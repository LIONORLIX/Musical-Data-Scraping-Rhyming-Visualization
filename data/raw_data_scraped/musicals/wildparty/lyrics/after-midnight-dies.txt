After Midnight Dies


Sally

Down goes the wall

Down goes the guard

After midnight dies

It ain’t so hard

To see the truth.

No need for lies.

What we are is all we are

After midnight dies.



(Sally wanders around the party. A

Disheveled Eddie crosses to Mae, who

Sits alone. On the other side of the room,

Oscar crosses to Phil, who’s asleep at

The piano)
