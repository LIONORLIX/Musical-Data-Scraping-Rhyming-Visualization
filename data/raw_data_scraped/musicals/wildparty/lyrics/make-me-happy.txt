Make Me Happy


BURRS (holding a gun)

Now let's see

(pointing at Queenie) We've got one

(pointing at Black) We've got two

We've got - (pointing at himself)

Ooh - three

One:too:many for me.



Who's it gonna be?



(to Black) Take one step

Go on, make one move

Show your love

You've got a chance to prove it

Knock me out

Come on, jump right in

Brother, lose o win

You're gonna make me happy.



(to Queenie) Break my heart

Go on, tell me lies

Big surprise

Look how you emphasize it

Call my bluff

Come on, make me choose

Sugar, win or lose

You're gonna make happy



In my hands your future was golden

Now it's what I hold in my palm

In my hands you made a good living

Giving me the quiet and calm



In my hands you promised forever

But I see you're dropping the ball

In my hands

You fly

Or you fall!



BLACK BURRS

Burrs, you dog

Shut your hole



You don't know this girl

Play her Do tell...



And you gotta wake up early

Don't push me,

Don't push me



Drop that gun Oh, right...

Come on, take it slow

I'm growing weary

Let her go

And you're gonna make me happy. And that doesn't make me happy.





QUEENIE BURRS BLACK

Burrs, my sweet

Queenie, mine

What a long, hot night Sweet as wine What are you doing?

Let's not fight

I want you, I need you

No need to get excited Love, love, love, love Are you crazy?

Here I come

Let me love you...

Go on, let me in Don't be stupid

Burrs, you win

You're gonna make me You're gonna make me You're here to make me

happy. happy. happy.





BLACK, BURRS & QUEENIE

In my hands the future is crying

Rising high or dying in vain.

In my hands Salvation is nearing

Steering me from permanent pain

With my hands I'm asking a question

But I know the answer too well

In my hands:

Heaven

Or Hell.



BURRS

Who's it gonna be?

Who's it gonna be?

Who's it gonna be?

Who's it gonna be?

Who's it gonna be?



(to Queenie) He says he'll die for you

Well, now don't you wanna know?

Don't you wanna know?

Would he really die for you

Or is that just the after-dinner show?

We've got a situation

Shit or get off the pot

(to Black) So what do you say,

You wanna give her away?

Or do you wanna get



BURRS (to Black) QUEENIE BLACK

On our knees?

Stay calm

Time is running out Stay cool

You crazy fool

Scream and shout Burrs, You think she

Nobody cares about you Queenie cares about you Cares about you?!



(Burrs point the gun at Black.)

Burrsie Don't do it

Life is shot

Whether you're here or not Burrsie Don't do it

Gone to pot Burrsie Don't do it

May you rot Burrsie No, no, no, no,

Burning hot... Burrsie, Burrsie, Burrsie No, no, no, NO!



QUEENIE

Burrsie!



BURRS

What?!



QUEENIE

Please make me laugh

Please make me smile

Please stop this song and dance for a while.



(Burrs cocks the gun.)



QUEENIE

Don't make me hurt

Don't make me cry



BURRS

Don't make me cry



QUEENIE

Don't make me have to do or die.



BURRS

How many girls have let me down?



QUEENIE

Shhh,

Burrsie,

Easy -



BURRS

How many girls would love a clown?



QUEENIE

From now until forever you can be

The live of the party



BURRS

Maybe I can be

The king of the hill?

How I want to be there, running the who

Until it's time to go

Or till it's time to
