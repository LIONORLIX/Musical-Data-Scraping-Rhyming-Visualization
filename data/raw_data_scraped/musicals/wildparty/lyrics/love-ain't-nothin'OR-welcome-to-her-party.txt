Love Ain't Nothin'/ Welcome To Her Party


Kate

So where were you’





Black

You’re the one who brought me here,

Told me to go play.



Kate

Play yes. Not fall in love.



Black

What’!

[kate

You’re fallin’ in love with her.



Black

And what do you care’

As long as i look good and deliver as long as i play by your rules-





Kate

Last i checked, black you were doin’

Pretty damn good playin’ by my rules-

Spendin’ my money.



Black

Maybe that’s no longer enough.



Kate

Huh. Well, well.]





Kate

Loverman’s in love’

Go on- be ‘in love’ ‘ ain’t it sweet’

Come morning she’ll be back

In the arms of that clown

And loverman, you ass will be

Out in the street

And then what’

Back to peddling that old mooch’

‘black likes the way that you

Look tonight:

Elegant, sleek and cool.’

It’s getting old. You’re getting old ‘

There are younger men out there now. Mister black.

I’m gonna tell you something:

Something i learned long ago:                           [‘too long ago’ ]

Love ain’t nothin’ but a whole lotta nothing’

And you know what it’s really about’

It’s about comfort, not love, loverman

It’s about comfort

And keepin’ hold of it, hangin’ on to it

And doin’ whatever it takes

To get more

Love ain’t nothin’ but a whole lotta nothin’

A whole lotta nothin’!



Black

That’s you, kate. That ain’t me



Kate

Don’t you mess my party

Don’t you mess with me ‘

Don’t you mess with me!



Burrs

Queenie

Maybe yours, burrs but not mine. My

Party’s just getting’ goin’.



Burrs

Queenie

What’ beat me with the heel of your

Shoe, till my lips turn blue’



Burrs

Queenie’s feelin’ hot tonight. Yes she is.

Welcome to her party

How ya like the dress’



Welcome to her party

Baby where’s my ice’

Who here’s up for action’

Who here’s new’

Welcome to her party



(to black)

Who the hell invited you’ and blackie,

My boy, since you’re plannin’ on throwin’

A torpedo into the s.s. Queenie, i better

Warn you, don’t touch her face.



Queenie         [burrs

‘got nothin’ that gets that pretty lady so riled up

Shut up burrs.          As gettin’ caught with her face

Minus all that paint.’]



‘cause like the cheap whore she is,

Everything’s gots be all perfumed and

Painted so’s you don’t smell the stink

That’s justa festerin’ underneath.



Queenie

The stink i got on me

Is from living with you,

Lying next to you. You

Have seeped into my skin, into my blood

And the only thing

That’ll wash me clean’

Is seeing you dead      burrs

Welcome

To her party

Burrsie,

Where’s my

Ice’

Queenie’s up

For dancin’

Queenies’ up

For anything
