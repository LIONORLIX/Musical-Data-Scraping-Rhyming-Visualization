Tabu / Taking Care Of The Ladies


Oscar

(accompanied by the victrola)



Tabu!

When you’re forbidden your desire.

Tabu!

You yearn to play with fire?



Queenie

So, mister black, show me.



Black

Show you what?



Queenie

The game, the hustle. Or is this it?



Black

Believe me, if black was running the

Mooch, you’d be in his arms begging him

To never leave you.



Queenie

So go on, mooch me.



Black

Right here? Right now?



Queenie

Umhm.



Black

You sure you’re ready? Cause if you melt or swoon or-



Queenie

The mooch?



Black

Black likes the way that you

look tonight

Elegant, sleek and cool

Black likes the way that you

shake the moves:

So beautiful  but watch it-

A panther’s trapped inside:

tell me- who rolls your cigarettes



And keeps you satisfied?

Taking care of the ladies

I take care of myself.

Black’s glad to send you

Where you wanna go

And baby it’s your party

What more ya wanna know?

What more ya wanna know?

What more?



Queenie

I can see how that might work on some

Women-desperate, lonely.



Black

But not you.



Queenie

Nope.



Black

O.k. Here’s another mooch. It’s sunday

Night and this woman i know, let’s call

Her kate, an acquaintance, is invited to

This party and she drags me along.



Queenie

Drags you?



Black

‘And the second i walk in i see this

Other woman; blonde, beautiful-and the

Way she holds her cigarette, the way her

Hand folds on her hip?



Black likes the way that

She burns tonight

Ginger and smoke and sex

Black likes the way that she likes him back:



Everything about her

Says ‘danger-run away’

But something in her eyes seems to

Be begging me to stay?

Taking care of the ladies

I take care of myself

Everything about her says ‘danger - stay away’

But danger and a woman

More i gotta say

What more

What more.



For a guy i talk a lot

We oughta just listen to the music

We oughta just dance



Oscar

Tabu!

Forbidden fruit upon  the vine

Tabu!

I’ll never rest until you’re mine



( time seems to suspend itself--- black and queenie dance)



Sally (vocalize)

Dreamy, slow?



oscar

It’s whatcha wanna do but whatchaknowya

Shouldn’t do ?

Like what i wanna do with you:

You say you wanna do it, too?

That’s tabu?!
