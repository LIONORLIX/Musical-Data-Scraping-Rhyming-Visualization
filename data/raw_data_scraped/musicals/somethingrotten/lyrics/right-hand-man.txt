Right Hand Man


If you ever got in trouble

I would be there on the double

Just to bail you out



If there's anything you lack

You know I've always got your back

Thats what its all about



Think of me as your sidekick

Helping you whenever I can

I'm more than just a woman, baby

When the pressure's coming baby

Let me be your right hand man



(But your not a man, I'm the man)

UGH,  your not hearing me



If you're ever in a pickle

You can call for me and quick'll

Be how fast I run



(I'm not in a pickle)



You and me should be a team

For any dream or any scheme

That's how it should be done



Sure I could stay in the background

Just smiling every now and again

But just to be a pretty lady

That would be a pity baby

Let me be your right hand man



(You should listen to her, she's usually right)

(Eat your cabbage)

(Okay)



I am stronger than you think

Don't be thinking I ain't tough

I am where you oughta go

When the goings getting rough



So when things are going badly

(But they're not)

(They kinda are)

(No things are fine)

But if they weren't

(it's okay)

Love (what) UGHHH

(What?)

Quit trying to protect me

(Can we change the subject, please?)



Not until I know that



If you're ever in a fix

And its a fix you need to nix

Then I'm your go to guy

(You're not a guy)

Don't be so literal



And don't forget I'm not a shrinking violet

A solid rock am I

So don't be thinking I'll crumble

When the you know what hits the fan



There's no problem thats to big

When your married thats the gig

So don't be a sexist pig



Is it asking to much of you

It's only cuz I love you

Let me be your right

In fact I'll show you that I'm right



(What are you doing now?)

I'm going to get you boys some meat



Baby I'm your right

Don't put up a fight

I can be your right

Starting here tonight

Let me be your

RIght....Hand....Man



Let me be your right hand man
