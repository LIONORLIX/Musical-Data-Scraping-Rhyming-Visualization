Will Power


Ensemble:

We want Will! x12 (Dialogue overlapping)

Shall I compare thee

To a summer's day

Yeah!

Thou art more lovely and more temperate

And the rough winds shake the darling buds of May, yeah

And summer's lease



Ensemble:

Hath all too short a date

I adore the adoration

Though others may abhor it

It's quite a new sensation

What shall we call it?

In fact, I'd like to feel you a little bit later

Do you want more? (Yeah)

When do you want it?

Tomorrow? (No)

Later (No)



Let me hear you say now! (Now!)

Let me hear you say now is! (Now is!)

Oh do it with me

Now is the winter of our discontent

Made glorious summer by this sun of York

Glorious (Glorious)

Well I can't be (Glorious)

Now let me see g-l-o-r-i-o-u-s

Who fits that bill?

Will:

Huzzah! (Huzzah!)

Oh that is music to my ears

And if music be the food of love, play on

That's a new one, don't even know where to put it yet

Speaking of love, here's one for all you lovers out there



Soft, what light through yonder window breaks?

Thank you

It is the east and Juliet is the sun.

Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon, ah, the moon.

Who is already sick and pale

So sick and so pale with grief

That thou her maid art far more fair than she

Than she (Ahhh)

Thank you, I like that one too



Ensemble:

Will:

I am the Will with the skill to thrill you with my quill

I am the hardworking bard you got, yeah

I am the Will (He is the Will)

I am the Will (He is the Will)

I am the man you wanna see up on the bill (Bill, bill)

I am the star b-a bard

The chosen one that heaven smiled upon (Thank you God)

If you wanna see perfection on any given day,

You know what they say

When there's a will, there's a way (Will Power)

When there's a will, there's a way (Will Power)

Will Power (Will Power!)

Good night

Good night

Parting is such sweet sorrow
