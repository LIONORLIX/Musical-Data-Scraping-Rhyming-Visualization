Welcome to the Renaissance


Lyrics:

War of the roses chaucer’s tales

The brutal feudal system

Holy crusades

Bubonic plague

Can’t say that we’ve really missed them



So dark and barbaric,

So dull and mundane

That was so middle ages

That was so charlemagne



Welcome to the renaissance

With poets, painters and bon vivants

And merry minstrels, who

Stroll the streets of london

A-strumming their lutes

And puffy pants and pointy leather boots



Welcome to the renaissance

Where we ooh and aah here

With ambiance

We’re so progressive

The latest and the greatest

We bring it to you

With much ado

Welcome to the renaissance

Where everything is new



Here we’ve made advances in the sciences

We have the latest gadgets and appliances

Our mugs are made of pewter

Our houses all are tudor

Decorated with a modern flair



See us in our petticoats and farthingales

Our trendy beards we trim to look like swallow tails



We’re called elizabethans

They’re all a bunch of heathens

Heathens heading straight for you-know-where



While witches are burning and wars tend to start

We bring you moments of culture and art

(culture and art)



Welcome to the renaissance

Where our printing press has the fancy fonts

That’s right we’re fancy

And very literary

Theatrical too

It’s what we do

Welcome to the renaissance

Where everything is new



Hey look it’s francis bacon with a chicken

What’s he makin’?

Well i think he’s found a way of freezing meat

That’s new



Hey look it’s walter raleigh

Found a new world, by golly,

And he’s brought us all tobacco, what a treat

Also new



And we have a list of writers who

Are always writing something new

It’s true we do

Like who?

Like who?!



Like dekker

(whoo)

John webster

(whoo)

Ben jonson

(uh huh)

And christopher marlowe



Thomas kyd

Thomas middleton

Thomas more



And our brightest star yo

He’s the bomb

The soul of the age

The wiz of the elizabethan stage

He’s incredible

Unforgettable

He’s just so freakin’ awesome

Shakespeare

Shakespeare



We love him (x8)



His brains are so brilliant

His writing’s first rate

His acting’s is incredible

Isn’t he great



We love him (x4)

(isn’t he great)

We love him (x2)

We love him



Welcome to the renaissance

Not the one in italy or in france

No one in england

The one where william shakespeare

Is cream of the crop

The one where william shakespeare is the top



Welcome to the renaissance

The 16th century experience

The age that’s golden

The olden days are over

We bid them adieu

Well hallelu-



Welcome to the renaissance

Where everything is new

Where everything is new

Welcome to the renaissance

Where everything is new
