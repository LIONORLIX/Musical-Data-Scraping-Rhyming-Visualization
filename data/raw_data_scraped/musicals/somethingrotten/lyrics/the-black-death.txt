The Black Death


Troupe:

What's that coming up the Silk Road

Out of China?

The Black Death, Black Death, woo!



What's that creeping round your peepee

And your vagina?

The Black Death, Black Death, woo!



The Black Death,

It's gonna get ya

It's the Black Death,

It's gonna hit ya with those blisters,

Oozing like syrup

That pesty little pestilence is killing half of Europe

It's the Black Death

And it's coming for you



Mmmmmm, mmmmm

The Black Death, Black Death, woo!

Mmmmmm, mmmmm

The Black Death, Black Death, woo!



The Black Death

It's getting closer

It's the Black Death

It's getting grosser

And it's making its way across England

Soon everything that's dangling won't be any good for dingling



It's the Black Death

And it's coming for you

Black Death!
