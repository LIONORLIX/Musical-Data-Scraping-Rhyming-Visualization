Right Hand Man (Reprise)


Bea:

(Spoken)

What stops us from walking out on him? I think it's because you know like I know.



(Sung)

If you ever got in trouble

He would be there on the double just to bail you out

If there's anything you lack

You know he's always got your back

That's what he's all about



He has his faults but he means well

And he always does the best that he can

But it should be understood

I wouldn't change him if I could

Cause I know his heart is good



And he'll always be your right hand man



(Spoken)

He can't do this without you, maybe it's time you carry him for a bit.



Nigel:

(Spoken)

Okay, I will



Bea:

(Spoken)

Good and I'm sure you'll give them a show they'll never forget!
