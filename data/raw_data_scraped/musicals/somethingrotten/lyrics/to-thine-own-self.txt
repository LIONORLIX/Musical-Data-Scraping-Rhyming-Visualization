To Thine Own Self


Nigel (Spoken):

Nick, just read it

I really think I'm on to something here



Nick (Spoken):

I am reading

And where's the omelette?



Nigel (Spoken):

There is no omelette!



Nick (Spoken):

What do you mean there's no omelette?

There has to be an omelette

It's called Omelette!



Nigel:

(Spoken) Ahh!

Are you hearing yourself? (What?)

Nick, are you hearing yourself? (Yes)

I can't believe we're having a conversation about a story that has to be all about eggs (So?)

Eggs! (Yes)

What is it with you and these eggs?



Nick:

You just have to trust me

I know what I'm doing



Nigel:

I think that you're out of your mind if you think that pursuing that is a good thing



Nick:

Well I do



Nigel:

Okay, well I don't



Troupe Member (Spoken):

Read him this part, it's beautiful



Nigel (Spoken):

Doesn't matter, he won't listen



Will (Spoken):

I should really take these before this turns ugly



Troupe Member (Spoken):

Just read him what you wrote



Nick (Spoken):

What the hell are they talking about?



Nigel:

(Spoken) You asked me to write something, well here it is

Sure as the day follows into night

Sure as the sky turns to blue

This much I know

This much is true

Above all else, whatever you do



Nigel & Troupe:

To thine own self be true



Nick (Spoken):

That's it?



Troupe (Spoken):

It's beautiful

It's like good line and good advice



Will (Spoken):

I don't know

I thought the whole breakfast theme was really strong

Everyone loves breakfast



Nick (Spoken):

Exactly!

But there's no Danish, there's no ham, there's no breakfast at all!

You're completely ignoring the theme



Nigel (Spoken):

I'm ignoring the breakfast theme because it's ridiculous



Nick:

Oh, are you hearing yourself? (Nick!)

I said, are you hearing yourself? (Yes)

I can't believe you're trying to change direction

Because you decided that my ideas are wrong (Please)

I'm wrong

And this true to yourself thing is right?



Nigel:

That's not just a line

It's what I believe



Nick:

Then you are a fool and really naive

If you think it's as simple as that



Nigel:

Well I do



Nick:

Okay well I don't



Troupe (In Background):

So what do we do x5



Nigel (Spoken):

Ah, this is hopeless

I don't know how to get through to you

Nick, the fact that you think Omelette is good,

It worries me

Guys, can you help me out here



Troupe Member (Spoken):

You really should listen to him, Nick

It just makes your heart wanna soar



Troupe:

Sure as the day follows into night

Sure as the sky turns to blue

This much I know

This much is true

Above all else, whatever you do

To thine own self be true



Nick (Spoken):

Want some truth?

Here's the truth

Omelette will be known as perhaps the single greatest play ever written



Nigel (Spoken):

How can you possibly know that?



Nick (Spoken):

I just do



Troupe (In Background):

So what do we do x5



Nick (Spoken):

This will be talked about for generations to come

We need a hit

Not some audience-repelling death play about your descent into madness



Nigel (Spoken):

This descent into madness, that's you

Nick, I mean it

Whatever happened to the guy who inspired me to become a writer?



Nick (Spoken):

He finally has a great idea

Now, we open in a week

Are you going to help me write Omelette or not?



Nigel (Spoken):

No



Nick (Spoken):

No?



I can't

It doesn't feel right

And deep down, I don't think it feels right to you either



Troupe (In Background):

So what do we do x4



Nick:

I'll tell you what we do

We serve up what they're hungry for

Omelette the musical



We're on our way to glory

We'll play for kings and queens

And there and then they'll see the end will justify the means



Troupe:

The end will justify the means!

Sure as the day follows the night



Nick:

Surely we must see this through (Okay, if you say so)

Damned if I don't (Don't!)

Damned if I do (Do!)

Damn it, I don't have the luxury to

Hang all my hope on some simplistic trope

Like to thine own self (To thine own self)

Be true



Troupe Member:

Oh God, I hope what he's saying is true



Troupe:

Please be true

Please be true

Please be true
