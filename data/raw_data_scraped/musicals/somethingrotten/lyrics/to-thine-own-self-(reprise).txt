To Thine Own Self (Reprise)


Nick:

Sure as the day follows into night

Sure as the sky turns to blue

This much I know

This much is true

Above all else, whatever you do

To thine own self be true



Why did I wander so far from the man

That the two of you knew I could be

I lost sight of all that mattered somehow

I did not see it then

But I see it now



I just didn't think

I had it in me

So I made it harder than it had to be

Should have followed my heart

Should have listened to you

To thine own self be true



Nick & Nigel:

To thine own self be true
