It's Eggs!


Troupe:

What's that cooking on the griddle

Whipped up and beaten?

It's eggs, it's eggs, woo!



Throw some fixings in the middle

So good for eating

It's eggs, it's eggs, woo!



Nick:

I see within this fluffy form

The scrambled nature of my soul

I'm cracking up as I begin

To see the bits of me within this



All:

Om-om-om

Om-om-om

Om-om-om

Omelette!



Om-om-om

Om-om-om

Om-om-om

Omelette!
