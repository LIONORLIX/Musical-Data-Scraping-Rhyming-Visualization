Welcome to the Renaissance (Reprise)


Minstrel:

Welcome to the Renaissance

Now the stage is set for a huge response

Or an epic failure

And Nick and Nigel Bottom are starting to sweat

Cause they don't have the story written yet



Welcome to the Renaissance

Gotta give the audience what it wants

But it's not that easy

And if you're William Shakespeare

You're feeling the heat

To still be new



Welcome to the Renaissance

What's a famous bard to do
