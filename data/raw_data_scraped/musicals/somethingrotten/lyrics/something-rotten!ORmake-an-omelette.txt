Something Rotten!/Make an Omelette


Nick:

(Spoken) Alas, poor yolk, I know thee well

There's something rotten

There's something rotten



Nick & Troupe:

You can smell it

You can tell there's something rotten

Now the kingdom is shot

And it's all gone to pot

Heaven help us there is something rotten



[Thanks to Angela for lyrics]





Broadway's musical (2015)

Something Rotten the Musical - Make an Omlette Lyrics



"Make an Omlette" is a song from Something Rotten! performed by Brian d'Arcy James (Nick) and Company.



Nick (Spoken):

My father newly dead and the funeral

Boiled eggs now coldly furnished for the marriage table

Methinks another chef might have whisked our desperate eggs together as one



Will (Spoken): Pray, nephew, what dost thou mean?



Nick:

(Spoken) Well, I'll tell you

The fruit of life can't always taste like sweet persimmons

Sometimes it's hard to swallow I'm afraid

But when life has handed you some lemons

Then hand it back a mug of lemonade



My father said this to me

That he did and then he blew me

Away with wisdom simple and concise

He said, "Eggbert, life is merely what you make of it

So heed this sound advice"



You make wine from sour grapes

You got a flat pancake, hey, call it a crepe

When life gives you eggs, make an omelette

You get cola from a nut

A dirty worm makes silk from out of his butt

When life gives you eggs, make an omelette

Omelette



Nick & 3 Troupe Members:

The solution to your troubles is

Cheese and vegetables

And making bacon omelette, yeah!



Nick:

When it looks like you should quit

Find another way of looking at it



Nick & 3 Troupe Members: When life gives you eggs



3 Troupe Members:

You gotta make that om-om-om

Om-om-om

Om-om-om



Omelette

Om-om-om

Om-om-om

Om-om-om

Omelette



Omelette!



Nick (Spoken): Father!



Nostradamus:

The solution to your troubles

Right here in River City

Shipoopi, Chicago

Omelette, yeah!



When it looks like you should quit



Nostradamus & Troupe:

Find another way of looking at it

When life gives you eggs

Just a great big bowl of eggs

When life gives you eggs

You gotta make that omelette



Nick & 3 Troupe Members:

Crack, splat, psss

Crack, splat, psss

Make an omelette

Crack, splat, psss

Make an omelette



3 Troupe Members:

Make an omelette

Make an omelette

Make an omelette now



Nick (Spoken): How?



3 Troupe Members:

First melt a tablespoon of butter in a medium frying pan

Over medium heat

And saut√© the onions and green pepper 'til they're tender

Add the ham pieces



Nick:

Make an omelette

Make an omelette

Make an omelette now



3 Troupe Members:

Turn off the heat

Let the omelette sit one minute in the skillet

So the inside cooks right through



Nick:

Take that egg and beat it

Take that egg and beat it

You gotta heat it and beat it, before you eat it

So beat that egg

Beat that egg

Beat that egg



Nick & 3 Troupe Members:

And that's how you make an omelette

That's how you make an omelette

That's how you make an omelette

That's how you make it



Woman:

And I am telling you

I'm not gonna be an omelette

Oh no, no, no



Nick (Spoken): We really beat that omelette



All:

You make wine from sour grapes

You got a flat pancake, just call it a crepe

When life gives you eggs, make an oh-oh-oh-omelette

Take an egg and pass on by

If your cholesterol's high, you'll probably die



When life gives you eggs

Just a great big bowl of eggs

When life gives you eggs

You gotta make that om-om-om

Om-om-om

Om-om-om

Om-om-om

For heaven's sakes!



It was white and yellow

And white and yellow

And white and yellow

And white

Make an omelette!
