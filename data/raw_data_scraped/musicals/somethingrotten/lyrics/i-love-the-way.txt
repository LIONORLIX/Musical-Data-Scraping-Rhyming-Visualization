I Love the Way


PORTIA:

I love Sydney, and Marlow,

And often I borrow their words to express how I feel.

I love poems of mystery,

Fantasy, history, oh what seductive appeal.

At night, alone in my bedroom,

Satisfying my need.

The candlelight fire ignites my desire,

To read

Oh, every time I hear a perfect rhyme I get all tingly

Because I know,

That to find a perfect rhyme is not an easy, thingly.



I love places that words let me go

I love the way that your words move me so

No words have touched me the way that yours do

And I love…you are really doing something to me mister poetry man

Oh forgive me, I never get to discuss poems in this way



NIGEL BOTTOM:

Oh it’s okay,

I just never knew that poetry could affect someone the way it affects me



PORTIA:

Me neither



NIGEL BOTTOM:

It’s the end all, the be all. Oh, you ought a see all the books that I have on my shelf



PORTIA:

Me too

I find pleasure perusing those writings and musing so often I pleasure myself

Wait, that didn’t sound right



NIGEL BOTTOM:

No, I know what you mean

When I’m deep in the throes of impassionate prose,

I could scream



PORTIA:

You scream?



NIGEL BOTTOM:

Yeah



PORTIA:

So do I! Ahh

Oh, I love a lilting line of lyrical alliteration.



NIGEL BOTTOM:

Who doesn’t love alliteration?



PORTIA:

And then I’m like well, when the phrases come together like a consummation



NIGEL BOTTOM:

It’s sweet elation



BOTH:

I love the places that words let me go,

I love the way that your words move me so

I love, that you feel, the same way I do

And I love,

You know that I love,

You know that I love,



NIGEL BOTTOM (spoken):

Me too!
