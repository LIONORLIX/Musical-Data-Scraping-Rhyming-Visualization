God, I Hate Shakespeare (Reprise)


Nick:

God, I hate Shakespeare

But when I sit and really contemplate Shakespeare

I guess I hate the fact that he is everything I ever dreamed that I could be

I mostly hate the way he makes me feel about me

Cause the truth is



It wouldn't be that bad to be Shakespeare

In fact, I'd give my left gnad to be Shakespeare

If I could only have one tiny little smidgen of his notoriety

It would relieve me of these pressures of responsibility



I've gotta make it happen

Gotta find that pot of gold

If there was just some way to know just what the future holds

(Spoken) What the future holds!
