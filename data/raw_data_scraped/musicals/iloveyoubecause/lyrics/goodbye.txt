Goodbye


AUSTEN

Marcie, Marcie`s mine

And I`m hers and it`s true

She isn`t perfect and that`s fine

But what happens now

To the life I thought I knew`



I had my whole life planned out

There was no surprise to speak of

I knew without a doubt

What life was all about

But now I`m caught because I`m choosing

Between the life I may be loosing

And Marcie who I love



I tried to stay at a course

I think of Marcie and I wander

There`s this pulling, aching force

And I`m certain of the source

At first I did my best to completely destroy it

Now I`m starting to enjoy it



Is this goodbye to knowing my next move

Goodbye to knowing where I stand

This change isn`t small

Do I go back on all

I planned

And say hello to uncertain mornings

Just we can take it from there

But I may regret this choice

Cause I`m reeling

It`s too much to bet

On a whim that I`m feeling

Too much is resting on my saying goodbye



Then there`s Marcie

Who sees who I am

And still has the nerve to care

I know that Marcie, won`t give a damn

If I plan my life out or leave up to chance

Or set up shop on the moon

She`ll love me anyway

So I say



Goodbye to my expectations

Goodbye to everything I know

No rules to obey

So I`ll wake everyday

And I`ll go

We`ll see to who knows what

Who cares as long as Marcie`s by my side

I used to just do what was planned and prepared

I wouldn`t trust chance because I was too scared

But Marcie is my reason know to try

So to who I used to be and the life I thought I wanted

Goodbye

Goodbye

Goodbye
