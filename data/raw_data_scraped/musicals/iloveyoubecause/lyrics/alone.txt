Alone


FEMALE

Remember that night when I met you

When you both hung out here in the bar

I said to my friend there `I bet you,

Those two, they won`t make it too far.`

He could have discussed any topic

He could have chosen baseball, football, croquet

So why`d he have to choose her`

What a lame, pathetic loser

You don`t need him anyway



Alone

You are better off

Trust me, it`s true

You don`t need him there

To always care

About every little thing that you do

Alone

Means that your life plans

Aren`t always set in stone

Trust me

You`re better off alone



Right`



MARCIE

Yeah` Sure`



MALE

Hey-ey! You ready to go`



FEMALE

Oh! This is my friend, uh`



MARCIE

Marcie.



FEMALE

Marcie. She`s re-discovering single-hood.



MALE

Welcome back.

(laughs)



Maybe one night you were thinking

I`ll stay-in and give Nietzsche a stab

Then again I could just go out drinking

`Til I puke in the back of a cab



MARCIE

He would say, `Marcie that`s stupid,

You are better than that``



MALE

But, hey

Now his opinion doesn`t matter

Go ahead and do the ladder

You don`t need him anyway



FEMALE AND MALE

Alone

You do what you want

Never what he wants instead



MARCIE

Not up each night

In a stupid fight

When the two of us should both be in bed



FEMALE AND MALE

Alone

Means you never swoon

At the smell of his cologne



MARCIE

`Cause that`s just stupid



FEMALE AND MALE

You`re better off alone



FEMALE

Right`



MARCIE

Yeah, stupid Old Spice!



FEMALE

All right. We`re gonna get going, good luck.



MARCIE

Oh` thanks for the advice!



FEMALE

Yeah.



MALE

Hey, what` We work in a bar.

We`re basically therapists who encourage you to drink. Good night!



MARCIE

One day I might land a meeting

With a man who takes photos in France

I don`t need someone begging and pleading

`Honey stay and give our love a chance.`

I`ll go wherever I want to

I won`t stay where I don`t wanna stay

I`ll leave tomorrow or whenever

And I might just stay forever

I don`t need him anyway



Alone

Means I`ll never be

So I can find romance

I can act on a whim

Not have check with him

Like six or seven months in advance

Alone

Means you`re never hurt

That is what this night has shone

I think it`s clear to see

I`m better off alone



I need him anyway

More than any man I`ve ever known

Feeling hurt with him is better

Than feeling free alone
