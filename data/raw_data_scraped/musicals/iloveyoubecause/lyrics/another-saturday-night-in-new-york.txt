Another Saturday Night in New York


(Austin)

Brush my teeth in the shower

Shampoo twice.

Clean and Primp for an hour,

Old spice is nice.

Then I'm off to Katherine's

I knock on her door.

Right on time like I have every Saturday before.

She's my angel in white.

Another Saturday night in New York



And we're off to have dinner,

Drink some fine wine.

Every night I'm the winner,

Katherine is mine.

I'm flying so high that I can't see the ground.

They can see me all the way down the Long Island Sound.

The departure is bright.

Another Saturday night in New York.



(Ensemble)

This cities funny,

When you're in love everything seems perfect.

Cabbies honk their horns together

In a perfect symphony.

You tip your hat to

all the ladies and they smile at you.

Every 'Up yours!'

'Screw you!'

and 'Watch it jerk!'

Are in Perfect harmony



(Austin)

Stop right here by the flowers,

Just like last week.



(Man)

And each one like last night and the night before.



(Austin)

For the next couple hours

Somewhere that's chic.



(Lady)

Billy Joel says he might go back on Tour!



(Austin)

All is perfect, what can go wrong?

When I die can I bring the whole city along?

For this mad date tonight.

Another Saturday night in New York.



(Ensemble)

Katherine's waiting.

Let's go.

Ever since you two first started dating,

It has seemed that all of New York is laid out just for you.

But then it changes

And all that you know rearranges.

And you start to think that it all almost sounded to good to be true.



(Austin)

Another Saturday night in New York!



(Ensemble)

Another Saturday night

Another Saturday night



(Austin)

I'll be with Katherine for the rest of my life!



(Ensemble)

Another Saturday night

Another Saturday night



(Austin)

I'll be with Katherine for the rest of my life!

Another Saturday night



(Ensemble)

Another Saturday night

Another Saturday night

Another Saturday night in New York
