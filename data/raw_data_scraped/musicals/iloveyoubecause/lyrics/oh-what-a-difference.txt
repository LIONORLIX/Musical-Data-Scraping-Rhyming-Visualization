Oh What A Difference


JEFF

Austen, look at you. You`re a mess.

You want Katherine back for some reason, I guess. Well, here`s how`



AUSTEN

How`



JEFF

Pretend you couldn`t care less.



AUSTEN

Have you met me` You think I can just move on that easily`



JEFF

You want her back now, don`t you, bro`



AUSTEN

Uh` yes.



JEFF

Then there`s one thing you need to know



AUSTEN

Which is`



JEFF

Forget her

Boom!

Kaput!

She`s gone!

Women come back when you move on

They`re fed up with you

They list all the things that you lack

So, you go on, find someone new

Guess what`

Now they want you back

That`s all it takes

Oh, what a difference

A little indifference makes



AUSTEN

Jeff, it can`t possibly be that easy.



(Jeff sighs)



Don`t you think more people would know about it`



JEFF

You see that guy cry in his beer

A girl walks up, blows in his ear

Next thing she`s taking off her clothes

Now his ex has moved on

But, trust me!

She knows she says

Let`s screw no strings

He stammers okay

Through his shock

Suddenly his cellphone rings

It`s her!

And she just wants to talk

Oh, what a difference

A little indifference makes



So, come on, Austen

Let`s hit the town

Go somewhere loud

We`ll both get plowed

Hey, it`s Jeff

I won`t let you down

Oh, come on, Austen

She`s a memory

Just let it fade

We`ll get each other`s backs

Let loose, relax

Who knows`

You might even get laid



AUSTEN

(laughs) I don`t know.



JEFF

Oh, come on, Austen. If you go out and have fun,

somewhere Katherine will sense that you`re happy and come running back.

They have a sick sense.



AUSTEN (correcting)

Sixth.



JEFF

Un-uh, sick.



So, let`s go out, forget the past



Come on, please



Austen and Jeff back together at last



That`s what I`m talking about



Listen, it`s me, I`ll get us dates

Hey, I know this bar that Katherine hates

Do what we used to do

But, look!

Katherine`s back for more



AUSTEN

I`ll say `My, God, you`re back, it`s you.

Katherine, have you met the door`!`



JEFF

Yeah, that`s all it takes



BOTH

Oh, what a difference



AUSTEN

An itty, bitty difference



JEFF

What a whole life-changing difference



BOTH

A little indifference makes
