I Love You Because (Finale)


AUSTIN:

Marcie, look at you. you make decisions without thinking twice. In fact, barely once.



Marcie, look at you. you go see a show without checking the listings.

you join a new club each day and the next day change your mind



that once drove me crazy that thats who you are. but.. thats who you are



i love you because youre not the person i dreamed of at all.

i love you because you make me feel like a fool.

you don't do whats expected, you're handed a

rule and its simply rejected. and it's easy to say "i love you anyway" but i don't.

i love you, because



MARCIE:

Austin, look at you. with your big goofy smile, your freshly pressed shirt, and constant tie.



Austin, look at you. you want what is quiet and structured and normal.

i tried to say that's ok, but it all came out all wrong.



it would have gone better if only i'd said what you just said to me



i love you because you're not the person i dreamed of at all.

i love you because you have too many reasons behind your every move and decision.

you make up your mind with routine and precision.

and its easy to say, "i love you anyway" but i don't. i love you because.



AUSTIN:

people will call us insane. insane to love someone who's so clearly wrong.

but now it seems that wrong is the right way to go



MARCIE:

people will say that we're crazy, crazy to fall for each other but then again,

what do they know`



BOTH:

i pushed you away, you weren't at all the person i wanted to answer my call.

the things i used to question, im starting anew



MARCIE:

i wanted someone like me



AUSTIN:

who wouldnt ask hard questions



MARCIE:

who'd share all my thoughts



AUSTIN:

who'd share all my fears



BOTH:

now, all i want is to be here with you



BOTH:

i love you because you're not the person i dreamed of at all.

i love you because you pushed me in a direction that i thought was lost.

you're the answer to a question that i never posed.



and its easy to say "i love you anyway"

but i'll never say "i love you anyway" cause i don't.

i love you, because
