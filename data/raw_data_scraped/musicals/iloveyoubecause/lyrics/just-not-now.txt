Just Not Now


MARCIE

Stop there, Austen, hold it, freeze

Give me a second, would you please`

You said a lot there and I`m just not there

I need to think your honesty real

And it appeals to my emotions

Which is great, but I`m sure

Now`s no the time for romantic notions



I want true love someday

But, just not now

A picket fence clich`

But just not now

How can I make you see

Though this feels right to me

Now`s not the time to be

Quite where you are



You`re here too soon

And though I know

It sounds unfair

If you would wait for me, I swear

I`ll meet you there

I need some time to heal

And though your love seems real

I`m not prepared to feel

The way you do



Let`s take this time

We`ll wait it out

Or else we`ll crash and burn

I`m lost

And I don`t know

What true love`s all about

Please give me time to learn



I want so much to say

Okay, I love you too

I will, but not today

You know, I know you do

And though it`s hard you must

Control your heart and trust

I want with you

Just not now
