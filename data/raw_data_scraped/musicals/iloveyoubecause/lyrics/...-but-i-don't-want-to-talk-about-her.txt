... But I Don't Want To Talk About Her


AUSTEN

I write poetry

Romance, usually

I`m very romantic

(laughs)

Wait, I`m tough too

A romantic, tough guy

Yeah, sorta like Rock Hudson`

But straight.



This one time, I wrote a poem for my ex-girlfriend

She said

That`s the best thing I`ve ever read

And she reads poets, yet

Yates, Cummings, you name it

She`s got all these guys bouncing round her head



MARCIE

She sounds great



AUSTEN

She has an insight that could win a Pulitzer Prize

There`s in genius in her mind that truly sparkles through her eyes

She`s so smart, to be near make`s your intelligence rise`

But, I don`t want to talk about her



So, uh, what do you do`



MARCIE

I`m a photographer.



AUSTEN

Wow, okay. What kind of stuff do you do`



MARCIE

I try to capture the beauty of the human spirit.



AUSTEN

Speaking of beauty, that reminds me of my ex-girlfriend

Oh, she was gorgeous, but she never really knew it

She had this smile, I swear to God

You were blessed if you had one chance to view it

She had a look that could inspire symphonies

Or cause the most stubborn men to have epiphanies

She was as enchanting as Hepburn in Breakfast At Tiffany`s`

But I don`t want to talk about her



MARCIE

So, you have an ex-girlfriend`



AUSTEN

Ugh, I don`t want to talk about her.



MARCIE

Oh, right, sorry. There`s some things I don`t want to talk about either.



AUSTEN

Like what`



MARCIE

I don`t want to talk about the fact that I

Can`t seem to find a single guy

Who meets all my desires



AUSTEN

That`s fine. Maybe we could talk about`



MARCIE

I don`t want to talk about how many men

Have claimed that they would be the one

And it turns out they`re all liars



AUSTEN

Now, Marcie`



MARCIE

I don`t want to talk about the day when I

Experimented with my girlfriend

And I almost came out



AUSTEN

We can talk about that if you really want to.



MARCIE

But there`s always something missing

Now matter where I search

But, that`s not what I want to talk about



AUSTEN

Oh, man` you`re kind of a whiner.



MARCIE

I`m sorry, but wasn`t it you who spent the first half of this conversation talking about your ex-girlfriend`



AUSTEN

How dare you bring up the topic of my ex-girlfriend`!



MARCIE

Yeah, but you were the`. WHAT`!



AUSTEN

Who is gorgeous and brilliant, by the way.



MARCIE

Yeah, I heard.



AUSTEN

You know, I`m trying not to think about it and you throw it in my face`!



MARCIE

Throw it`!



AUSTEN

Now I`m all upset, and it`s the fifteenth time today



MARCIE

Less than I would`ve guessed.



AUSTEN

I`m not the type who runs or hides



MARCIE

I see.



AUSTEN

I follow my plan

Follow my guides



MARCIE

No matter how misguided they may be



AUSTEN

You`re wrong.

I know we`ll be together

Forever

Besides

I don`t want to talk about her



MARCIE

Obviously.
