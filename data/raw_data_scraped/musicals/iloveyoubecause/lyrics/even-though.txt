Even Though


MARCIE

When you first told me you loved me

I was more than just a little bit surprised

But then you left and I realized

There was something about you

Something, so that I couldn`t live without you



And even though you`re just a little bit pretentious

Even though you`re more traditional than my dad

Even though you drove me crazy from hello

You touch a part of me I didn`t even know I had



And so, I need to say I want you anyway

I want you anyway

Even though this might not be the perfect way to tell you

But, perfection never was what I did best

Two months ago, I never would have guessed

That I`d compare to `you know who`

But now I know I belong with you



And even though I think your way of life is different

Even though there`s not a single thing we share

Even though you`re not like anyone I know

You take me to a place I didn`t even know was there



And so, I need to say I choose you anyway

I choose you anyway

Even though the night when I first met you

You were freakish

Now look at us, we both have come so far

You`re not different

I`m not different

But, it`s all together different

`Cause I love you in spite of who you are



And even though you`re so much paler than my dream man

Even though you`re such a dork and I don`t feel the way I should

Even though I should stop, well here I go

I love you in a way I didn`t even know I could



And so, I need to say I love you anyway

I love you anyway

Even though
