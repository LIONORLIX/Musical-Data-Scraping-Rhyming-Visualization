We're Just Friends


DIANA

We go out in the evening

We catch a movie, dinner too

We hang out with our buddies

The way two good friends do

We say goodnight

And that`s alright

If that`s alright with you

Friendship`s where this ends

`Cause we`re just friends



JEFF

Who also make-out.



DIANA

Friends are like an old shirt

That always makes you smile



JEFF

It makes you feel all fuzzy inside

But it gets dirty once in a while



DIANA

A friend does to you

As you do unto them

Like Jesus recommends



BOTH

And we want to be good boys and girls

So that`s why we`re just friends`

With benefits



DIANA

We each do our own thing

`Cause we`re not dating and that`s fine



JEFF

But every couple of evenings

Our things will intertwine



DIANA

If you`re friends I guess



JEFF

A little caress



DIANA

Or cunnilingus doesn't cross the line



BOTH

No!

Friendship`s where this ends `cause we`re just friends



JEFF

Who use chocolate syrup on each other in ways you never thought of before`



DIANA

Sure!



JEFF

We`ll be honest when we`re in the bedroom



DIANA

I`ll tell you if you`re too fast or too slow



JEFF

Thank you!



BOTH

People say this way doesn`t work

But, I know that`s not so



JEFF

If I suck, I wanna know



BOTH

We will keep this our little secret

Why explain what can`t be explained`

We don`t need a defense

`Cause this all makes perfect sense

In fact, it`d be stranger if we abstained



We won`t let this get weird



JEFF

I`ll stand hard



DIANA

I`ll stay resolved



JEFF

I won't take you for granted



DIANA

I won`t get emotionally involved



BOTH

I have lots of friendships

But this one transcends

All the ones in which I don`t get laid

And that`s why we`re just friends`

With benefits



Hmmm`. Mmm`

And that`s why we`re just friends



DIANA

Who see each other naked.



BOTH

La, la, la, la, la, la, la

And that`s why we`re

Just friends

Just friends

Just friends

Just friends
