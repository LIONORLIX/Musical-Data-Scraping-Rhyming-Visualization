Sincerely, Me


CONNOR:

Dear Evan Hansen,

We've been way too out of touch

Things have been crazy and it sucks that we don't talk that much

I should tell you that I think of you each night

I rub my nipples and start moaning with delight



EVAN: (spoken) Why would you write that?



JARED: (spoken) I'm just trying to tell the truth



EVAN:

(spoken) You know what? If you aren't going to take this seriously...



JARED: (spoken) Okay you need to calm yourself!



EVAN: (spoken) This has to be perfect, okay?

The emails have to prove that we were actually friends.

They've got to be completely realistic



JARED: (spoken) There is nothing unrealistic about the love that one man feels for another.



EVAN: (spoken) Let's go back.



JARED: (spoken) In fact, it's something quite beautiful.



EVAN: (spoken) Let's go back Jared!



CONNOR: I've gotta tell you life without you has been hard



JARED: (spoken) Hard?



CONNOR: Has been bad



JARED: (spoken) Bad?



CONNOR: Has been rough



JARED: (spoken) Lame!



CONNOR: And I miss talking about life and other stuff



JARED: (spoken) Very specific



EVAN: (spoken) Shut up



CONNOR: I like my parents



JARED: (spoken) Who says that?



CONNOR:

I love my parents

But each day's another fight

If I stop smoking drugs then everything might be alright



JARED: (spoken) Smoking drugs



EVAN: (spoken) Just fix it!



JARED: (spoken) This isn't realistic at all! It doesn't even sound like Connor!



EVAN: (spoken) Well I want to show that I was a good friend,

Y'know? That I was trying to help him



JARED: (spoken) You are just cute as a freaking button



CONNOR: If I stop smoking crack



EVAN: (spoken) Crack?!



CONNOR:

If I stop smoking pot then everything might be alright

I'll take your advice

I'll try to be more nice

I'll turn it around

Wait and see



It’s all that it takes

Is a little reinvention

It’s easy to change if you give it your attention

All you gotta do is just believe you can be who you want

to be sincerely, me



JARED: (spoken) Are we done yet?



EVAN: (spoken) Well I mean I can't just show them one email



JARED: (spoken) Okay, please stop hyperventilating



EVAN: (spoken) I'm not hyperventilating



JARED: (spoken) You're having considerable trouble breathing



EVAN: (spoken) I'm having no trouble breathing



JARED: (spoken) Do you need a paper bag to breath into?



EVAN: (spoken) I'm not hyperventilating!



EVAN: (sung)

Dear Connor Murphy,

Yes I've also missed our talks

Stop doing drugs

Just try to take deep breaths and go on walks



I'm sending pictures of the most amazing trees



JARED: (spoken) No!



EVAN: You'll be obsessed with all my forest expertise



JARED: (spoken) Ridiculous!



EVAN:

Dude I'm proud of you

Just keep pushing through

You're turning around

I can see



CONNOR: Just wait and see



ALL:

It’s all that it takes

Is a little reinvention

It’s easy to change if you give it your attention

All you gotta do is just believe you can be who you want to be sincerely, me



CONNOR: My sister's hot



EVAN: (spoken) What the hell?



JARED: (spoken) My bad



CONNOR: Dear Evan Hansen, thanks for every note you send



EVAN: Dear Connor Murphy, I'm just glad to be your friend



EVAN & CONNOR: Our friendship goes beyond your average kind of bond



But not because we're Gay

No not because we're gay

We're close, but not that way

The only man that I love is my dad



CONNOR: Well anyway



EVAN: You're getting better everyday



CONNOR: I'm getting better everyday



EVAN & CONNOR: We're getting better everyday



ALL: Hey hey hey hey!



It’s all that it takes

Is a little reinvention

It’s easy to change if you give it your attention

All you gotta do is just believe you can be who you want to be sincerely,



Miss you dearly



Sincerely Me
