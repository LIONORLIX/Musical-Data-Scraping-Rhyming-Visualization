Requiem


ZOE:

Why should I play this game of pretend?

Remembering through a secondhand sorrow?

Such a great son and wonderful friend

Oh don't the tears just pour



I can curl up and hide in my room

There in my bed still sobbing tomorrow

I could give in to all of the gloom

But tell me, tell me what for



Why should I have a heavy heart?

Why should I start to break in pieces?

Why should I go and fall apart for you?



Why should I play the grieving girl and

Lie saying that I miss you

And that my world has gone dark without your light

I will sing no requiem tonight



LARRY: (spoken) I'm going to bed



CYNTHIA: (spoken) Come sit with me



LARRY: Cynthia



CYNTHIA: For five minutes?



LARRY: I'm exhausted



CYNTHIA: You know Larry, at some point you're going to have to start-



LARRY: Not tonight. Please. I'll leave the light on for you.



LARRY: (sung)

I gave you the world, you threw it away,

leaving these broken pieces behind you

Everything wasted, nothing to say

So I can sing no requiem



CYNTHIA:

I hear your voice, feel you near

Within these words I finally find you

And now that I know that you are still here

I will sing no requiem tonight



ZOE & LARRY: Why should I have a heavy heart?



ZOE:

Why should I say I'll keep you with me?

Why should I go and fall apart for you?

Why should I play the grieving girl and lie saying that I miss you

And that my world has gone dark without your light

I will sing no requiem

Tonight

'Cuz when the villains fall, the kingdoms never weep

No one lights a candle to remember

No, no one mourns at all

They lay them to sleep

So don't tell me that I didn't have it right

Don't tell me that it wasn't black and white

After all you've put me through, don't say it wasn't true

That you were not the monster that I knew,

'Cuz I cannot play the grieving girl and lie

Saying that I miss you and that my world has gone dark



LARRY: I will sing no requiem



CYNTHIA: I will sing no requiem



ZOE: I will sing no requiem tonight
