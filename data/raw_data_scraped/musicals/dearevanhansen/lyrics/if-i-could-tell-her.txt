If I Could Tell Her


EVAN:

He said

There's nothing like your smile

Sort of subtle and perfect and real

He said

You never knew how wonderful

That smile could make someone feel



And he knew

Whenever you get bored

You scribble stars on the cuffs of your jeans

And he noticed

That you still fill out the quizzes

that they put in those teen magazines



But he kept it all inside his head

What he saw he left unsaid

And though he wanted to

He couldn't talk to you

He couldn't find the way

But he would always say



If I could tell her

Tell her everything I see

If I could tell her

How she's everything to me

But we're a million worlds apart

And I don't know how I would even start

If I could tell her

If I could tell her



ZOE: (spoken) Did he say anything else?



EVAN: (spoken) About you?



ZOE: Never mind, I don't really care



EVAN: (spoken) No, no, no, he said so many things,

I'm just trying to remember the best ones.



EVAN: He thought

You looked really pretty, er-

It looked pretty cool when you put indigo streaks in your hair



ZOE: (spoken) He did?!



EVAN: And he wondered how you learned to dance

Like all the rest of the world isn't there



But he kept it all inside his head

What he saw he left unsaid



If I could tell her

Tell her everything I see

If I could tell her

How she's everything to me



EVAN & ZOE: But we're a million worlds apart



EVAN: And I don't know how I would even start if I could tell her



If I could tell her

But what do you do

When there's this great divide



ZOE: He just seemed so far away



EVAN:

And what do you do

When the distance is too wide



ZOE: I think I don't know anything



EVAN: And how do you say I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you



But we're a million worlds apart

And I don't know how I would even start

If I could tell her

If I could
