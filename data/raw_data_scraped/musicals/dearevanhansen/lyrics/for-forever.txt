For Forever


EVAN:

End of May or Early June

This picture perfect afternoon we shared

Drive the winding country road

Grab a scoop at A La Mode

And then we're there



An open field that's framed with trees

We pick a spot and shoot the breeze

Like buddies do



Quoting songs by our favorite bands

Telling jokes no one understands

Except us two

And we talk and take in the view



All we see is sky for forever

Let the world pass by for forever

Feels like we could go on for forever this way

Two friends on a perfect day



We walk a while and we talk about

The things we'll do when we get out of school

Bike the Appalachian trail or

Write a book

Or learn to sail

Wouldn't that be cool



There's nothing that we can't discuss

Like girls we wish would notice us but never do

He looks around and says to me

"There's nowhere else I'd rather be"

I say "me too"



And we talk and take in the view

We just talk and take in the view



All we see is sky for forever

Let the world pass by for forever

Feels like we could go on for forever this way

This way



All we see is light for forever

'Cause the sun shines bright for forever

Life will be all right for forever this way

Two friends on a perfect day



And there he goes

Racing toward the tallest tree

From far across the yellow field I hear him calling "follow me"

And there we go

Wondering how the world might look from up so high



One foot after the other

One branch then to another

I climb higher and higher

I climb until the entire

Sun shines on my face



And I suddenly feel the branch give way

I'm on the ground

My arm goes numb

I look around

And I see him coming to get me

He's coming to get me

And everything's okay



All we see is sky for forever

Let the world pass by for forever

Buddy, you and I for forever this way

This way



All we see is light

'cuz the sun shines bright

Life will be all right for forever this way

Two friends

True friends

On a perfect day
