Disappear


CONNOR:

Guys like you and me

We're just the losers

And we keep waiting to be seen, right?

And no one seems to care

Or stops to notice that we're there

So we get lost in the in between



But if you can somehow keep them thinking of him

And make me more than an abandoned memory

That means we matter too

It means someone will see that you are there



No one deserves to be forgotten

No one deserves to fade away

No one should come and go

And have no one know he was ever even here

No one deserves to disappear

To disappear

Disappear



It's true

But even if you've always been that

Barely in the background kind of guy



EVAN: You still matter



CONNOR: And even if you're somebody who can't escape the feeling

that the world's past you by



EVAN: You still matter



CONNOR:

If you never get around to doing some remarkable thing

That doesn't mean that you're not worth remembering

But the people who need to know



EVAN: They need to know



CONNOR: You need to know



EVAN: I'll show them



CONNOR: That no one deserves to be forgotten



EVAN:

No one deserves to be forgotten

No one deserves to fade away, to fade away



EVAN & CONNOR:

No one should flicker out

Or have any doubt that it matters that they are here



EVAN: No one deserves



CONNOR: No one deserves



EVAN & CONNOR: To disappear, to disappear, to disappear



CONNOR:

When you're falling in a forest and there's nobody around

All you want is somebody to find you

When you're falling in a forest

And when you hit the ground

All you need is somebody to find you



EVAN: No one deserves to be forgotten



EVAN, ALANA & JARED: No one deserves to fade away



CYNTHIA: No one deserves to be forgotten



EVAN, ALANA, JARED & CYNTHIA:

No one deserves to be forgotten

No one should flicker out or have any doubt

That it matters that they are here



No one deserves to disappear

To disappear

To Disappear

No one deserves, no one deserves, no one deserves to be forgotten

No one deserves to disappear

Disappear
