You Will Be Found


So maybe let that feeling wash away

Maybe there’s a reason to believe you’ll be okay

‘Cuz when you don’t feel strong enough to stand

You can reach out your hand



And oh, someone will coming running

And I know, they’ll take you home

Even when the dark comes crashing through

when you need a friend to carry you

when you’re broken on the ground

You will be found



So let the sun come streaming in

Cuz you’ll reach up and you’ll rise again

Lift your head off the ground and look around

You will be found

You will be found

You will be found

You will be found



There’s a place where we don’t have to be alone

Every time that you call out

You’re a little less alone

If you only say the word

Across the silence

Your voice is heard



Even when the dark comes crashing through

When you need a friend to carry you

When you’re broken on the ground

You will be found

So let the sun coming streaming in

Cuz you’ll reach up and you’ll rise again

If you only look around

You will be found

You will be found

You will be found



Out of the shadows, morning is breaking

All is new, all is new



Suddenly I see that

All is new, all is new

You are not alone

You are not alone

You are not alone

You are not alone

You are not alone

You are not alone



Even when the dark comes crashing through

And you need someone to carry you

When you’re broken on the ground

You will be found

When the sun comes streaming in

You’ll reach up and you’ll rise again

If you only look around

You will be found

You will be found

You will be found
