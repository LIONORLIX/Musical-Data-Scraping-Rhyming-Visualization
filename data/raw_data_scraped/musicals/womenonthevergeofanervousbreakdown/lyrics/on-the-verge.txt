On The Verge


Welcome to the edge, the verge, the ledge

The bridge is out

You’re looking in the mirror

Thinking this is where it rips

A tear a tear a fear of what’s been coming cause it hear now



Ten miles up you walk the wire

It’s high in those high heels

Hard to do the dance with circumstance

Has brought you to the edge

So this is how it ends



You feel the wall

You real

You fall

At least you\'ve got your friends around you

Seemly lacking half their wits

You’re on the hill and throwing things and going down together

Listen to your shout

The breaks are out

The cars okay but where the wheels

Isn\'t this a trick?

You\'ve lost your grip

You’re coming to the edge



All you see is the bleeding sky above your head

A purple ocean boils below

The red horizon tied around your throat



You\'ve lost your voice

You\'ve lost your will

You lose your mind

And yet it’s kind of thrilling

When you step up to the line

(Step up to the line)

The edge

The urge

And suddenly you’re swimming in it

(And suddenly you’re swimming in the surge

Swimming in it, swimming in the surge)



And you sinking

Its murder on your hands when your head is underwater

Not that you should mind

You\'ll see

You\'ll find

You don’t need a rudder when your ships gone down



This is our eclipse

Your wig

Your life

The edge

You’re slipping on it



Admit it’s kind of thrilling as your

Dealing on the brink

And you’re ming

And you’re drunk

In a bar

You’re a word

The fact that you are hanging by

So keep it to yourself

Shut up

Or not…

Let go

Hang on

And pretty soon your coolalating



Like a banchi

Canchi

Cope

She out of role but she’s listening

Baby it’s a date

You can’t be late

Where dancing

Where dancing

Where dancing

Where dancing



But welcome to the verge

The presents and the….

Take the edge

Welcome to the verge

Welcome to the verge

It’s pretty scary

Welcome to the verge

To the comic of the edge

Welcome to the verge



-Spoken-

Pepa please, you shouldn’t be upsetting yourself in your condition

“What condition?”

Your pregnant……
