Island


I wanted exactly what you did:

An island for two in the clouds

With gas and electric included

Coaching above all the noise of the city

Away from the traffic and crowds

Happily cast away

Sleeping to noon.



And often we\'ve laughed on our mattress raft in our bedroom lagoon

We breathe through.



Where did it go?

Where did it go?

Was it worst away?



Where did it go?

I thought I saw it here yesterday.?



Now suddenly its drowning in salt water.



You wanted the same thing that I did:

An island with closet space to spare.

But now that it seems you\'ve decided

To pack up a suitcase and swim for it.



I think I\'m becoming aware

Of an unfamiliar feeling

Of falling through the floors.

It all looks the same

But nothings the same as before

Like the names on our doors.



Where do they go?

Where do they go?

When they disappear?



Where is the red dealt on the mat

That says you were here?



Hard to find your way surrounded by salt water.



You dance on the sand the way we did.

You know that a step has to mix.

I thought I knew just what we needed.

It\'s funny everything looks different through salt water.



The thing about islands is this,

The important thing to know before you can blend in:

An island with two can be paradise,

With one, you\'re just shipwrecked and stranded.



Where do you go?

How do you swim

In a tidal wave?



What do you do?

When do you know

That you can\'t be saved?



Where do I go?

I wish you\'d tell me

\'cause I forget.



Up in the clouds,

up with the smoke from your cigarette.



Where do I go?
