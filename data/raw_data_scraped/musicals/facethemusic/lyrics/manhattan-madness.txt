Manhattan Madness


Manhattan, Manhattan, Manhattan, Manhattan

Manhattan madness

You've got me at last

I'm like a fly upon a steeple

Watching seven million people

Do a rhythm

That draws me with 'em



Manhattan, Manhattan, Manhattan, Manhattan

Manhattan madness

You're going too fast

I'm like a baby on a rocker

Watching Father Knickerbocker

Being busy

I'm getting dizzy



When shadows creep, in my bed I tumble

But never sleep for I hear the rumble

In the street, the tramping of feet

That haunt me the whole night long

And through the day I'm watching the drama

That people play in your panorama

And I hear in tones very clear

The sound of your restless song



Subways below and trains above racing

Packed with humanity

Taxis and trucks and trolley cars chasing

Busy as they can be

Steaming machines and riveters grating

Motors instead of men

Buildings go up with wrecking crews waiting

To tear them down again



Newsies that shout sensational headlines

Peddlers with things to sell

Noisy cafes and whispering breadlines

Children that scream and yell

Whistles and bells and siren horns blowing

Pistols that crack and roar

Traffic that stops and goes without knowing

What's all the shooting for



Manhattan, Manhattan, Manhattan, Manhattan

Manhattan madness

You've got me at last

I'm like a fly upon a steeple

Watching seven million people

Do a rhythm

That draws me with 'em

And it's mad!
