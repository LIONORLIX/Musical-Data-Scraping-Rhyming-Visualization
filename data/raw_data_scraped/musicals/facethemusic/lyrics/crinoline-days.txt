Crinoline Days


[Verse:]

Back to the olden

Days that were golden

Memory often strays

Before anyone could gaze

At Molly's and May's

Little ankle displays

Time with its changes

Often arranges

Styles that become the craze

But I am yearning

To be returning

Back to those crinoline days



[Refrain:]

In those dear old crinoline days

Old fashioned people with their old fashioned ways



When the girl a fellow courted

Was the girl he married and supported



Back in eighteen seventy-four

Rosy complexions weren't bought in a store



Granny and grand-daddy longingly gaze

Back to those crinoline days
