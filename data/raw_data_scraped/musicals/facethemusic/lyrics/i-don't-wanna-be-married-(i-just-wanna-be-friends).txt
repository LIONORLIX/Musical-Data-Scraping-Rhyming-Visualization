I Don't Wanna Be Married (I Just Wanna Be Friends)


[VERSE:]

[PICKLES:]

You're compromising me

But that's exactly as it ought to be

I simply fell for you because I wanted to fall

Don't speak of wedding chimes

Because we mustn't be behind the times

Besides a wedding isn't necessary at all



[1st REFRAIN:]

Don't worry because I fell

You don't have to do right by Nell

'Cause I don't wanna be married, I just wanna be friends



Don't worry 'cause I gave in

Best of families live in sin

'Cause they don't wanna be married, they just wanna be friends



While all the happy married couples sit and fight

We'll be still going strong

And fifty million Frenchmen say it's quite alright

And that many can't be wrong



I never would change my name

Even after the baby came

'Cause I don't wanna be married, I just wanna be friends



[2nd REFRAIN:]

[JOE:]

My father would give me hell

If I didn't do right by Nell

But I don't wanna be married, I just wanna be friends



Please grant me my father's wish

Shotgun weddings are just his dish

I don't wanna be married, I just wanna be friends



The kiddies wouldn't like it, they'd be awfully mad

'Twould be known near and far

To be a little "who's-this" isn't really bad

For some of my best friends are



If not for the family

Make an hon'rable man of me!

But I don't wanna be married, I just wanna be friends
