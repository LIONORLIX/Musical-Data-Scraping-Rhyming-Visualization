If You Believe


[Verse:]

Brothers

And sisters

Listen

You non-believers, listen

You better start to believe

All you doubters

Be "hallelujah shouters"

Or else you're going to grieve

There's no time to wait

You may be too late

So, listen

You don't know what you're missin'

Until you start to believe



[Refrain:]

If you believe that there's a heaven

You'll get to heaven

If you believe



If you believe that there are angels

You'll see the angels

If you believe



I'm not making promises

To the doubting Thomases



But if you believe the Lord can help you

The Lord will help you

If you believe



[Patter:]

-We do, we do, we do

Do you believe?

-We do, we do, we do

Do you believe?

-We do, we do, we do

Well, Jonah went out one night in a gale

Do you believe that?

-We do, we do, we do

Soon, he was swallowed up by a whale

Do you believe that?

-We do, we do, we do

Daniel lay down with lions that roared

Noah was on his ark when it poured

Moses looked up and he spoke to the Lord

Do you believe that?

Do you believe that? We do

-We do, we do
