At the Ballet


[SHEILA]

Daddy always thought that he married beneath him.

That's what he said, that's what he said.

When he proposed he informed my mother

He was probably her very last chance.

And though she was twenty-two,

Though she was twenty-two,

Though she was twenty-two,

She married him.



Life with my dad wasn't ever a picnic

More like a "Come as you are."

When I was five I remember my mother

Dug earrings out of the car

I knew they weren't hers, But it wasn't

Something you'd want to discuss.

He wasn't warm.

Well, not to her.

Well, not to us



But

Everything was beautiful at the ballet.

Graceful men lift lovely girls in white.

Yes,

Everything was beautiful at ballet.

Hey!

I was happy... at the ballet.



That's why I started class...



Up a steep and very narrow stairway.



[SHEILA AND BEBE]

To the voice like a metronome.

Up a steep and very narrow stairway.



[SHEILA]

It wasn't paradise...



[BEBE]

It wasn't paradise...



[SHEILA AND BEBE]

It wasn't paradise...



[SHEILA]

But it was home.



[BEBE]

Mother always said I'd be very attractive

When I grew up, when I grew up.

"Diff'rent," she said, "With a special something

And a very, very personal flair."

And though I was eight or nine,

Though I was eight or nine,

Though I was eight or nine,

I hated her.

Now,



"Diff'rent" is nice, but it sure isn't pretty.

"Pretty" is what it's about.

I never met anyone who was "diff'rent"

Who couldn't figure that out.

So beautiful I'd never lived to see.

But it was clear,

If not to her,

Well, then... to me...

That ...



[MAGGIE AND BEBE]

Everyone is beautiful at the ballet.

Every prince has got to have his swan.

Yes,

Everyone is beautiful at the ballet.



[MAGGIE]

Hey!...



[BEBE]

I was pretty...



[SHEILA]

At the ballet



[MAGGIE, SHEILA AND BEBE]

Up a steep and very narrow stairway

To the voice like a metronome.

Up a steep and  very narrow stairway



[MAGGIE]

It wasn't paradise...



[BEBE]

It wasn't paradise...



[SHEILA]

It wasn't paradise...



[MAGGIE, SHEILA AND BEBE]

But it was home.



[MAGGIE (Spoken)]

I don't know what they were for or against, really,

except each other.

I mean I was born to save their marriage

but when my father came to pick my mother up

at the hospital

he said, "Well, I thought this was going to help.

but I guess it's not..."

Anyway, I did have a fantastic fantasy life.

I used to dance around the living room

with my arms up like this

My fantasy was that I was an Indian Chief...

And he'd say to me,

"Maggie, do you wanna dance?"

And I'd say, "Daddy, I would love to dance!"



[SHEILA AND MAGGIE]

Doo-doo-doo-doo



[BEBE]

But it was clear...



[BEBE AND MAGGIE]

Doo-doo-doo



[SHEILA]

When he proposed...



[SHEILA AND BEBE]

Doo-doo-doo



[MAGGIE]

That I was born to help their marriage and when



[MAGGIE AND BEBE]

Doo-doo-doo-doo



[SHEILA]

That's what he said...



[SHEILA AND MAGGIE]

Doo-doo-doo



[BEBE]

That's what she said...



[BEBE AND SHEILA]

Doo-doo-doo



[MAGGIE]

I used to dance around the living room...



[BEBE AND SHEILA]

Doo-doo-doo-doo



[SHEILA]

He wasn't warm...



[SHEILA AND MAGGIE]

Doo-doo-doo



[BEBE]

Not to her...



[MAGGIE]

It was an Indian chief and he'd say:

"Maggie, do you wanna dance?"

And I'd say, "Daddy, I would love to..."



Everything was beautiful at the ballet,

Raise your arms and someone's always there.

Yes, everything was beautiful at the ballet,

At the ballet,

At the ballet!!!



[MAGGIE, SHEILA AND BEBE]

Yes everything was beautiful at the ballet.
