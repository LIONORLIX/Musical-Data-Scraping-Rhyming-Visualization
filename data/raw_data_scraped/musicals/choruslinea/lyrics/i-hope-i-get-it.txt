I Hope I Get It


[ZACH]

Step, kick, kick, leap, kick, touch...Again!

Step, kick, kick, leap, kick, touch...Again!

Step, kick, kick, leap, kick, touch...Again!

Step, kick, kick, leap, kick, touch...Right!

That connects with...

Turn, turn, out, in, jump, step,

Step, kick, kick, leap, kick, touch.

Got it?... Going on. And...

Turn, turn, touch, down, back, step,

Pivot, step, walk, walk, walk.



Right! Let's do the whole combination,

Facing away from the mirror.

From the top. A-Five, six, seven, eight!



[ALL]

God, I hope I get it.

I hope I get it.

How many people does he need?



[BOYS]

How many people does he need?



[GIRLS]

God, I hope I get it.



[ALL]

I hope I get it.

How many boys, how many girls?



[GIRLS]

How many boys, how many...?



[ALL]

Look at all the people!

At all the people.

How many people does he need?

How many boys, how many girls?

How many people does he...?



[TRICIA]

I really need this job.

Please God, I need this job.

I've got to get this job.



[ALL]

God, I really blew it!

I really blew it!

How could I do a thing like that?



[BOYS]

How could I do a thing like...



[ALL]

Now I'll never make it!

I'll never make it!

He doesn't like the way I look.

He doesn't like the way I dance.

He doesn't like the way I...



[ALL]

GOD, I think I've got it.

I think I've got it.

I knew he liked me all the time.

Still it isn't over.



[MAGGIE]

What's coming next?



[ALL]

It isn't over.



[MIKE]

What happens now?



[ALL]

I can't imagine what he wants.



[GIRLS]

I can't imagine what he...



[ALL]

God, I hope I get it!

I hope I get it.

I've come this far, but even so

It could be yes, it could be no,

How many people does he...?



I really need this job.



[A FEW VOICES]

My unemployment is gone.



[ALL]

Please, God, I need this job.



[A FEW VOICES]

I knew I had it from the start.



[ALL]

I've got to get this show.



[PAUL]

Who am I anyway?

Am I my resume?

That is a picture of a person I don't know.



What does he want from me?

What should I try to be?

So many faces all around, and here we go.

I need this job, oh God, I need this show.
