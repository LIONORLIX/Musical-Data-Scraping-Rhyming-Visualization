Music and the Mirror


[CASSIE]

Give me somebody to dance for,

Give me somebody to show.

Let me wake up in the morning to find

I have somewhere exciting to go.



To have something that I can believe in.

To have something to be.

Use me... Choose me.



God, I'm a dancer,

A dancer dances!



Give me somebody to dance with.

Give me a place to fit in.

Help me return to the world of the living

By showing  me how to begin.



Play the music.

Give me the chance to come through.

All I ever needed  was the music, and the mirror,

And the chance to dance for you.



Give me a job and you instantly get me involved.

If you give me a job,

Then the rest of the crap will get solved.

Put me to work,

You would think that by now I'm allowed.

I'll do you proud.



Throw me a rope to grab on to.

Helpome to prove that I'm strong.

Give me the chance to look forward to sayin':

"Hey. listen, they're playing my song."



Play me the music.

Give me the chance to come through.

All I ever needed was the music, and the mirror,

And the chance to dance...



Play me the music,

Play me the music,

Play me the music.

Give me the chance to come through.

All I ever needed was the music, and the mirror,

And the chance to dance...
