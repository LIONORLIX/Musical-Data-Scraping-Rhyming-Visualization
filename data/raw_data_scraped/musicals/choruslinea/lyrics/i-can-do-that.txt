I Can Do That


[MIKE]

I'm watchin' Sis

Go pitterpat.

Said,

"I can do that,

I can do that."



Knew ev'ry step

Right off the bat.

Said,

"I can do that,

I can do that."



One morning Sis won't go to dance class

I grabbed her shoes and tights and all,

But my foot's too small,

So,

I stuff her shoes

With extra socks,

Run seven blocks

In nothin' flat.

Hell,

I can do that,

I can do that.



I got to class

And had it made,

And so I stayed

The rest of my life.

All thanks to Sis

(Now married and fat),



I can do this.



That I can do!

I can do that.
