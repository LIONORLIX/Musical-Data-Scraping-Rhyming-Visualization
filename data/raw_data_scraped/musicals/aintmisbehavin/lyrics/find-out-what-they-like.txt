Find out What They Like


Song by: Nell Carter and Armelia McQueen



It's a duet between Nell and Armelia



I used to wonder right along, I mean why I couldn't hold a man

I used to wonder too

Every love affair went wrong, until I changed my plan

We're having no more trouble now

My daddies nice as he can be, oh sweetheart mine's better, hahaha

Ladies, I will tell you how, that's if you'll take a tip from me



Find out what they like, and how they like it, and let him have it just that way

Give them what they want, and when they want it, without a single word to say



You got to cater to a man and if you don't, day and night,

he'll find some other gal to do the things you won't, whoo hoo



Find out what they like, and how they like it, and let him have it just that way

Find out what they like, and how they like it, and let him have it just that way

Give em what they want, and when they want it, without a single word to say



Just use some more suger if he says your jam ain't sweet,

trust him, or he will seek for his dessert across the street

So, find out what they like, and how they like it, and let him have it just that way



Hey McQueen, how'd you get that man you were with last night?

Well I stole him.

Oh stop, his girlfriends pretty

And skinnyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy



Find out what they like, and how they like it, and let him have it just that way

Give them what they want, and when they want it, without a single word to say



Now you will lose him if you give him lollipops,

when you know he's crazy just to have some chops



Find out what they like, and how they like it, and let him have it just that way



Find out what they like, and how they like it, and let him have it just that way

Give them what they want, and when they want it, without a single word to say



Now if he claims his lodge is meeting every night,

that means you don't handle all your business right



So......find out what they like, and how they like it, and let him have it just that way

and let him have it just that way

and let him have it just that way

Way!!!!!!!!!!
