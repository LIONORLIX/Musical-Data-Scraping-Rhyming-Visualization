Cash for your Trash


Today's the day that all us cats,

Must surely do out bit,

We all must do our share,

So Uncle Sam can hit,



Save up all your pots and pans,

Save up every little thing you can,

Don't give it away,

Get some cash for your trash. Yeah.



Save up all that old newspaper,

Save the pilot light behind that draper,

Don't give it away,

Get some cash for your trash.



In between we'll do some lovin',

Wide handsome turtle dovin',

Will you listen, to me honey,

Get plenty of the foldin' money.



Save up all your iron and tin,

But when you go to turn it in,

Don't give it away,

Get some cash for your trash.



Say. In between we'll do some lovin',

Wide handsome turtle dovin',

Will you listen to me honey,

Get plenty of the foldin' money.



Save up all your iron and tin,

But when you go to turn it in,

Don't give it away, No, No,

Get some cash, get some cash, get some cash for your trash.



Get plenty of it too.
