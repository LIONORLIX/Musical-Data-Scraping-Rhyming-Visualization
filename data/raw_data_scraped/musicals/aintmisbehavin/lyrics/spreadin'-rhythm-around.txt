Spreadin' Rhythm Around


Music everywhere, feet are pattin'



Puttin' tempo in old manhattan



Everybody is (spoken) out hi' hattin



Spreadin' rhythm around



Everywhere you go trumpets blarin'



Drums and saxaphones rippin' and tearin'



Everybody you meet is rarin'



Spreadin' rhythm around



Up in Harlem flats, all of the cats give it that thing



Which when your in step



All of the hep people call swing



Those who can't afford silk or satin



Dames with gigolos who are latin



Come from Yonkers, the Bronx, or Staten



Spreadin' rhythm around
