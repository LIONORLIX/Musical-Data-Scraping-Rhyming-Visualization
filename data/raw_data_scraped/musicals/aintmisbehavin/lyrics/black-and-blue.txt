Black And Blue


Cold, empty bed,

Springs hard as lead,

Pains in my head,

Feel like old Ned.

What did I do

To be so black and blue?



No joys for me,

No company,

Even the mouse

Ran from my house,

All my life through

I've been so

Black and blue.



I'm so forlorn,

Life's just a thorn,

My heart is torn,

Why was I born?

What did I do to be so

Black and blue?



I'm white inside,

But that don't help my case.

'Cause I can't hide

What is on my face,

Oh!



[Alternative lyrics

for the last verse]

I'm sad inside,

But it don't help my case

'Cause I can't hide

All the sorrow

That's on my face.
