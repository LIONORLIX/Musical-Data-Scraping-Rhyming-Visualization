Honeysuckle Rose


Ev'ry honey bee fills with jealousy

When they see you out with me.

I don't blame them, goodness knows,

Honeysuckle Rose.



When you're passin' by flowers droop and sigh,

And I know the reason why.

You're much sweeter, goodness knows,

Honeysuckle Rose.



Don't buy sugar,

You just have to touch my cup,

You're my sugar,

It's sweet when you stir it up.



When I'm takin' sips from your tasty lips,

Seems the honey fairly drips,

You're confection, goodness knows,

Honeysuckle Rose.
