How Ya Baby


How ya baby hows about a little dance

when the band starts blowin' i feel alive

i feel like going say whats your job baby

How you baby is you in some kind of trance

Well im a killer diller with nothing on my mind

When they start to playin' sweet songs it leaves me on the rocks

When they start to playin' swing songs it leaves me to my socks

How ya babe hows about a little dance

Well you say you feel like truckin' I'm in the groove

If you feel like packing c'mon lets move you like swing music Yes how ya babe

I'm gonna get you



Knock Knock, Chop Chop



How ya babe



C'mon down we in the groove heck heck you gotta move play out that sweet swing music



How ya babe
