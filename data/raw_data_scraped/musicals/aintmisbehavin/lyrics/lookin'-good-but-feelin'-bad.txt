Lookin' Good But Feelin' Bad


Lookin' Good But Feelin' Bad

From grievein' over you,

Lookin' good to hide those bitter blues.



Weary days and lonely nights

I'm waiting here for you,

Hopin' that my love you won't refuse.

Roh doh doh doh doh doh doh

Roh doh doh doh doh

Roh doh doh doh doh doh doh

Bah bah bah bah bah bah bah



When I'm feelin' blue

And needin' you.
