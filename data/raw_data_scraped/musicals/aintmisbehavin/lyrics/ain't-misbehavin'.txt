Ain't Misbehavin'


No one to talk with,

All by myself,

No one to walk with,

But I'm happy on the shelf

Ain't misbehavin',

I'm savin' my love for you



I know for certain,

The one I love,

I through with flirtin',

It's just you I'm thinkin' of.

Ain't misbehavin',

I'm savin' my love for you

Like Jack Horner in the corner

Don't go no where,

What do I care,

Your kisses are worth waitin' for

Be-lieve me

I don't stay out late,

Don't care to go,

I'm home about eight,

Just me and my radio

Ain't misbehavin',

I'm savin' my love for
