Fat And Greasy


Watch Him while he's Sitting There

Chunks Of Fat Hanging Over His Chair

Oil Just Oozing From his Hair

Fat And Greasy as a Grizzly Bear



They Say That Sweet Perfumes Are Made From Fat

But Not The Kind That comes From This Greasy Cat

There's Fragrance In His Clothes

Seems Like Nothing you Ever smelled in a Rose



Man That Fool Is Fat and Greasy

Hot or Cool He's Fat And Greasy

Here To Here He's Fat and Greasy

Oh A Big Fat Greasy Fool



He's Got Big fat Liver Lips

Shakes like Jelly 'Round His Hips

He's a Waddlin' Wiggling Shame

And his Big Fat Whats It's Name

Ha Ha ! Look at That Guy Up There in the Spotlight

Look Who's Calling Names

When she Got Through Dancing with This Fool

Man She Didn't Smell The Same
