I've Got My Fingers Crossed


I've got my fingers crossed,

Not that I'm superstitious,

I'm afraid it's too good to be true.



I've got my fingers crossed,

No wonder I'm suspicious,

I'm so gay, and skies are much too blue.



Don't want no trouble,

with old man trouble,

and that goes double on account of because I'm in love, yes!



I've got my fingers crossed,

this love is so delicious,

I'm afraid it's too good to be true



Want no trouble with old man trouble

and that goes double on account of because

(because because)

On account of  because

(because because)



I've got my fingers crossed,

this love is so delicious,

I'm afraid it's too good to be true.



Yes!
