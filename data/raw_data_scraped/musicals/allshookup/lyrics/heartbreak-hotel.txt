Heartbreak Hotel


Now since my baby left me I've found a new place to dwell:

down at the end of Lonely Street at Heartbreak Hotel.

I'm so lonely, I'm so lonely,

I'm so lonely that I could die.



And though it's always crowded you can still find some room

for broken hearted lovers to cry there in the gloom

and be so lonely, oh so lonely,

oh so lonely they could die.



The bell hop's tears keep flowing, the desk clerk's dressed in black.

They been so long on Lonely Street they never will go back

and they're so lonely, oh they're so lonely,

they're so lonely they pray to die.



So if your baby leaves and you have a tale to tell

just take a walk down Lonely Street to Heartbreak Hotel

where you'll be lonely and I'll be lonely,

we'll be so lonely that we could die.
