How Could I Ever Know


LILY:

How could I know I would have to leave you?

How could I know I would hurt you so?

You were the one I was born to love!

Oh, how could I ever know?

How could I ever know?



How can I say to go on without me?

How, when I know you still need me so?

How can I say not to dream about me?

How could I ever know?

How could I ever know?



Forgive me.

Can you forgive me

And hold me in your heart,

And find some new way to love me

Now that we're apart?

How could I know I would never hold you?

Never again in this world, but oh,

Sure as you breathe, I am there inside you,

How could I ever know?

How could I ever know?



ARCHIBALD:

How can I hope to go on without you?

How can I know where you'd have me go?

How can I bear not to dream about you?

Oh, how can I let you go?



LILY:

How could I ever know?



ARCHIBALD:

All I need...



LILY:

Is there in the garden!



ARCHIBALD:

All I would ask...



LILY:

Is care for the child of our love!

Come, go with me, safe I will keep you.



ARCHIBALD:

Where you would lead me,

There I would,



LILY:

There I would, there we would,



ARCHIBALD and LILY:

There we will go.

Oh! How could I know?

Tell me how could I know?

Never to know you would ever leave me!

How could we know?



LILY:

How could I ever know?
