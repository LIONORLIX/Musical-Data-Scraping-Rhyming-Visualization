Disappear


There's nothing here that I want.

How dare she make this claim?

Isn't it clear what I want?

To serve has been my aim.



Still, I have to wonder

Who I'd be,

If it all belonged to me.



If they'd all disappear,

I'd start again.

I could be happy then,

I'd live like other men



If they'd all disappear

I could be free.

Cut off from pain and loss,

At last I'd be.
