A Bit Of Earth (Reprise)


ALBERT:

A bit of earth,



LILY:

A bit of earth,



ALBERT: ROSE

A drop of dew, A bit of earth

A single stem begins to rise.



ROSE and LILY:

Begins to rise.



ALBERT:

That bit of earth

Is pushed away, the flowers bloom

Before our eyes.



ROSE and LILY:

Before our eyes.



ALBERT:

For in the earth,

The charm's at work,

The word is past,

The days are warm.



LILY:

The days are warm.



ROSE:

The days are warm.



ALBERT:

Unfold and grown,

The winter's past,



ALBERT and LILY:

We're free from harm.



ROSE:

We're free from harm.



ALBERT, ROSE and LILY:

A bit of earth,

A bit of earth.
