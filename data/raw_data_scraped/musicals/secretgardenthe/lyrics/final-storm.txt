Final Storm


DREAMERS:

Coming a terrible storm,

Shaking the souls of the dead,

Quaking the floor underfoot,

Shaking the roof over head!

Not since I was a child

Have I feared!



ROSE:

Mistress Mary, quite contrary,

How does your garden grow?



AYAH:

Not so well, she said, see the lilly's dead

Pull it up, and out you go



MAJOR HOLMES:

Mistress Mary, quite contrary,

How does your garden grow?



CLAIRE: DREAMERS:

Oh, it's dry, she wailed, It's a maze, this garden,

See, the iris failed, It's a maze of ways

Dig it up, and out you go



AYAH: Something wrong inside it.

Mistress Mary,

Quite contrary,

How does your garden It's a maze, this garden,

Grow? It's a maze of ways.



LEUTENANT: FEMALE DREAMERS:

Had an early frost, High on a hill,



MAN and WOMAN:

Now it's gone, it's lost, Something

Dig it up, and out Wrong is

You go. Inside it.



DREAMERS:

It's a maze, this garden,

It's a maze of ways,

Meant to lead a soul astray.



It's a maze, this garden,

It's a maze of ways,

It's a maze, this garden,

It's a maze of ways,

Meant to lead a soul astray.



DREAMERS (ALBERT):

Mistress Mary, quite contrary,

How does your garden grow?

Had an early frost,

Now it's gone, it's lost,

Dig it up, and out you go (Mary!)

You're out, you go (Mary!)

Out, you go



LILY:

[hums]

Comes the garden.



MARY:

There it is! There's the door,

There's the door to the garden.
