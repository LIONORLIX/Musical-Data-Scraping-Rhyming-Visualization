A Girl In The Valley


LILLY:

A man who came to my valley,

A man I hardly knew,

A man who came to my garden

Grew to love me.



ARCHIBALD:

A girl I saw in the valley,

A girl I hardly knew,

A girl at work in her garden

Grew to love me.



LILLY:

From the gate,

He called out so kindly,

"Lass, wouldst thou 'low me

Rest here? I've ridden quite far."



ARCHIBALD:

"Share my tea,"

She bade me so gently,

Oatcakes and cream

Sweet plums in a jar.



LILLY:

And every day to my garden,

This man, who might he be

Came bearing baskets of roses,

For he loved me.



ARCHIBALD:

All I own I'd give!



LILLY:

Just a garden.



ARCHIBALD:

All I would ask is never to-



LILLY:

Never to leave!



LILLY and ARCHIBALD:

Say you'll have me,

Safe you will keep me.

Where you would lead me,

There



ARCHIBALD:

I would,



LILLY and ARCHIBALD:

There I would, there I would,

There I would go.



LILLY ARCHIBALD:

A man who came to my valley

A girl I saw in a valley

A man I hardly knew, A girl I hardly knew,

A man who gave me a garden, A girl who gave me a garden

Grew to love me. Grew to love me.
