The House Upon The Hill


DREAMERS:

High on a hill sits a big old house

With something wrong inside it.

Spirits haunt the halls

And make no effort now to hide it.



What will put their souls to rest

And stop their ceaseless sighing?

Why do they call out children's names

And speak of one who's crying?



MRS. MEDLOCK:

Well, you're right not to care

your uncle certainly isn't going

to trouble himself about you.



DREAMERS:

And the master hears the whispers

On the stairways dark and still,

And the spirits speak of secrets

In the house upon the hill.



MRS. MEDLOCK:

He's a hunchback, you see.

And a sour young man he was,

and got no good of all his mobney

and a big place till he were married.



MARY:

To my Aunt Lily?



MRS. MEDLOCK:

She were a sweet, pretty thing and he'd

have walked the world over to get her

a blade of grass that she wanted. When

she died, it made him worse than ever.



DREAMERS:

High on a hill sits a big old house

ith something wrong inside it.

Someone died, and someone's left

Alone and can't abide it.



There in the house is a lonely man

Still haunted by her beauty,

Asking what a life can be

Where naught remains but duty.



MARY:

Is it always so ugly here?



MRS. MEDLOCK:

It's the moor. Miles and miles

of wild land that nothing grows

on but heather and gorse and broom,

and nothing lives on but wild

ponies and sheep.

MARY:

What is that awful howling sound?



MRS. MEDLOCK:

That's the wind blowing through the bushes

they call it wuthering that sound

but look there that tiny light

far across there

that'll be the gate it will.



DREAMERS:

And the master hears the whispers

On the stairways dark and still,

And the spirits speak of secrets

In the house upon the hill.
