The Girl I Mean To Be


MARY:

I need a place where I can go,

Where I can whisper what I know,

Where I can whisper who I like

And where I go to see them.



I need a place where I can hide,

Where no one sees my life inside,

Where I can make my plans, and write them down

So I can read them.



A place where I can bid my heart be still

And it will mind me.

A place where I can go when I am lost,

And there I'll find me.



I need a place to spend the day,

Where no one says to go or stay,

Where I can take my pen and draw

The girl I mean to be.
