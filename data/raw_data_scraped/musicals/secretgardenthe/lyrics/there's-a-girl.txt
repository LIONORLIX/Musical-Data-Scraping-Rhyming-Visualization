There's A Girl


DREAMERS:

Can it be a dream?

Surely it does seem

Like a frightful dream!

How can this be true?



Won't her mother come?

Come, wake her up to play?

Won't her father say,

"Here's a rose for you?"



There's a girl who no one sees,

There's a girl who's left alone.

There's a heart that beats in silence

For the life she's never known,

For the life she's never known.
