Storm I


MAJOR HOLMES:

Close the shutters

And lock the doors,



ALBERT:

Brace the windows

As in it pours.



FAKIR:

Candles only the ones you carry!



LIEUTENANT SHAW:

Watch now!



ROSE:

Checking supplies,



AYAH and CLAIRE:

Watching the skies,



FEMALE DREAMERS:

Fares well the house that's ready!



ALL DREAMERS:

Coming a terrible storm,

Looks like the sea in a gale.

Branches are broken in half,

Carried aloft like a sail.

Not since I was a child

Have I heard such a horrible wail!

Ah!
