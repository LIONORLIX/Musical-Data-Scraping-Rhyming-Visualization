I Heard Someone Crying


MARY (LILY):

Oooh...

I heard someone crying.

Who, tho', could it be?

Maybe it was Mother,

Calling out, come see.

Maybe it was father,

All alone and lost and cold.

I heard someone crying.

Maybe it was me.

Oooh...



ARCHIBALD:

I heard someone singing.

Who, tho', could it be?

Maybe it was Lily,

Calling out to me.

Maybe she's not gone

So far away as I've been told!

I heard someone singing.

Maybe it was she.



MARY (LILY):

Maybe it was someone I could

Find and have a cup of tea.

Maybe it was someone who could

Bring the tea and come find me.

Oooh...



LILY:

I heard someone crying,

Tho' I can't say who.

Someone in this house

With nothing left to do.

Sounded like a father,

Left alone his love grown cold.

I heard someone crying.

Maybe it was you.



ARCHIBALD and MARY:

Maybe I was dreaming of a garden growing far below.

Maybe I was dreaming of a life

That I will never know.



MARY: ARCHIBALD:

I heard someone crying, Lily, where are you? I'm lost without you.

Who, tho' could it be? I can't walk these halls without you.



Someone in this house(Ooo...) Lily, where are you? I'm lost without you.

Whom no one seems to see (Ooo...) I have searched the world, but you're not there.

Someone no one seems to (Ooo...) Come, tell me why you

Hear, except for me Without you Brought me home if you're not here.



I heard someone calling. My Lily, where are you, I'm lost without you

Maybe it was he. Lily, I'm lost

(Ooo...) Without you.

(Ooo...)



MAJOR HOLMES, LTS. WRIGHT and SHAW:

I heard someone crying.

Who else could it be?

Surely it was Mary,

Why can no one see?



ROSE, CLAIRE and ALICE:

Crying for her mother,

For the life she's never known.



ALBERT:

So lost,

See her lying

In her room alone.



(LILLY):

(Ooo...)
