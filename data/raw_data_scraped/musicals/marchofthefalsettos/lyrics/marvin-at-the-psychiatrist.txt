Marvin At The Psychiatrist


(Jason)

My father says that love

Is the most beautiful thing in the world.

I think games are,

I think chess is the most

Beautiful thing,

Not love.



(Whizzer) (speaking)

Marvin at the Psychiatrist, a three-part mini opera.

Part One.



(Mendel) (singing)

Do you love him'



(Marvin)

Sorta kinda.



(Mendel)

Do you need him'



(Marvin)

Sorta kinda.

He makes me smile a lot,

Especially at mealtime.

It makes me feel I'm sort of smart.



(Mendel)

Mm-hmm.

Is he special'



(Marvin)

He's delightful.



(Mendel)

And romantic'



(Marvin)

Yes, but spiteful.

And yet it seems that so am I.



(Mendel)

Just enjoy what you can.

Love the boy, not the man.



(Marvin)

Man'

Sorta stylish.



(Mendel)

Kinda very'



(Marvin) (speaking)

Mmm, very very sorta.



(Mendel) (singing)

And kind of hard to describe'



(Marvin) (speaking)

Yes, you know, I think that's true.



(Mendel)

When he's naked,-



(Marvin)

Yes'



(Mendel)

Does he thrill you'



(Marvin)

Yes!



(Mendel)

Is he vicious'



(Marvin)

Yes!



(Mendel)

(thinks) Yes.

I think he's sorta kinda mean.

But I love him, and I need it.

If he loved me, I'd concede it.



(Mendel)

Don't despise what you feel.

Love the friend, not the heel.



(Marvin)

Heel'



(Mendel)

He's sometimes worthless'



(Marvin)

Sometimes evil.



(Mendel)

Sometimes smarmy'



(Whizzer) (speaking)

Part Two.



(Mendel) (singing)

It's queer, Mr. Marvin- sorry.



(Marvin)

Jesus'



(Mendel)

Strange, Mr. Marvin,

How your wife- your ex-wife's meager glories

Coupled with her tragic stories,

Moves me in unreported ways.



(Marvin)

She's a very good woman.

She's a wonderful woman.



(Mendel)

Do you mind that'

She was here to speak of Jason, and I find that

I hope Jason acts out more,

Cause there's a few more things we need explore.



(Marvin) (speaking)

No, I understand.



(Mendel)

Good! Very good. Very, very good!

I feel a lot better already.

Going on'

(singing) Was she a vicious woman'



(Marvin)

No.



(Mendel)

Did she beat the child'



(Marvin)

No!



(Mendel)

Did she ever drive you wild'



(Marvin)

No.



(Mendel)

Never'



(Marvin)

No.



(Mendel)

Never'



(Marvin)

No.



(Mendel)

Never-never-never-never'



(Marvin)

No.



(Mendel)

Never'



(Marvin)

No.



(Mendel)

Never'



(Marvin)

No, no, no!



(Mendel)

Was she faithful'

Be objective.



(Marvin)

Well, yes.



(Mendel)

She was faithful!



(Marvin)

Yes.



(Mendel)

And her last caress was:



(Marvin)

Careless.



(Mendel)

You mean, 'careful'.



(Marvin)

Careful,

Not to show she cared.



(Mendel)

So you weren't prepared

For the crying,

And the screaming.



(Marvin)

And the beating of the breast!

(speaking) I don't want to be rude.



(Mendel) (singing)

Does she sleep in the nude'



(Marvin)

...No.

Going on.



(Mendel)

Did you like that'

Would she change it if she knew you didn't like that'

Did she wear a negligee'

Could you blow and it would blow away'

I don't mean to interfere.

I would like to make that very clear.



(Whizzer) (speaking)

Part Three.



(Marvin) (singing)

My son's distressing.



(Jason)

My father's snide.



(Marvin)

I'm convalescing.



(Jason)

He's morbid and dissatisfied.



(Marvin)

What should I do now'



(Jason)

He loves another.



(Marvin)

I agree.



(Jason)

I love my mother.



(Marvin)

Why not me'

We go to ball games.



(Jason)

The ball is tossed.



(Marvin)

The pitcher's handsome.



(Jason)

And our team lost.



(Marvin)

Is that my problem'

Should I be blamed for that'



(Jason)

Explore museums.



(Marvin)

Admire art.



(Jason)

We stand together.



(Marvin)

But we stand there looking miles apart.

How do I reach him'

What words of wisdom'

What should I do now'



(Jason)

My father says that love

Is the most beautiful thing in the world.

I think games are,

I think chess is the most

Beautiful thing,

Not love.

The End.
