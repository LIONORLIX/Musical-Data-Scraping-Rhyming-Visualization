I'm Breaking Down


TRINA

I?d like to be a princess on a throne

To have a country I can call my own

And a king

Who?s lusty and requires a fling

With a female thing



Great, men will be men

Let me turn on the gas

I saw them in the den with

Marvin grabbing Whizzer?s ass



Oh sure, I?m sure, he?s sure he did his best

I bet he meant to be what he was not

The things he was are things which I forgot

He?s a queen

I?m a queen

Where is our crown?



I?m breaking down

I?m breaking down

My life is shitty

And my kid seems like an idiot to me

I mean that?s sick

I mean he?s great

It?s me who is the matter

Talking madder

Than the maddest hatter



If I repeat one more word

I swear I?ll lose my brain

What else should I explain?

Oh, yes it?s true

I can cry on cue,

But so can you



I?m breaking down

I?m breaking down

Down, down

You ask me if it?s fun to cry over nothing

It is, I?m breaking down



Oh, darn. I don?t have time for a breakdown now;

I have to get back to my banana-carrot surprise. Ouch! Gosh, that hurt.



Now let?s consolidate our simple thoughts

A healthy fruit is healthy ?til it rots

I agree

We sat beneath the apple tree

Marv, his friend, and me



Now, speaking of friends

Whizzer is sweet and trim

I think he sets the trends

I think in fact I?ll marry him

He wants me



I?d like to hate him but I really can?t

It?s like a nightmare how this all proceeds

I hope that Whizzer don?t fulfill his needs

Don?t is wrong

Sing along

What was the noun?



I?m breaking down

I?m breaking down

I?ll soon redecorate these stalls

I want some padding on the wall

And also pills

I wanna sleep

Sure thing?ll prob?lly worsen

But it?s not like I?m a healthy person



I?ve rethought my talks with Marv

And one fact does emerge

I think I like his shrink

So that is why I should turn to drink

I?m on the brink



Of breaking down

I?m breaking down

Down, down



I only want to love a man who can love me

Or like me

Marvin was never mine

He took his meetings in the boy?s latrine

I used to cry

He?d make a scene

I?d rather die

Than dry-clean

Marvin?s wedding gown



I?m breaking down

I?m breaking down

It?s so upsetting how I found

That what?s rectangular is round

I mean it stinks

I mean he?s queer

It?s me who is the freak

Who needs it maybe every other week



I?ve rethought my talks with Marv

And one fact to emerge

I play the foolish clown

The almost virgin

Who sing this dirge

Is on the verge



Of breaking down

I?m breaking down

Down, down

The only thing that?s breaking up is my fam?ly

The only thing that?s breaking up is my fam?ly

But me, I?m breaking down

Down
