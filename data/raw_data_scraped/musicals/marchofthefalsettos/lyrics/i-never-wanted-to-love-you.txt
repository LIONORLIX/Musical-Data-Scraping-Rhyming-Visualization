I Never Wanted To Love You


(Trina)

I never wanted to love you.

I only wanted to love and not be blamed.

Let me go, you should know

I'm not ashamed

To have loved you.



(Mendel)

I loved you more than I meant to.

In my profession, one's love stays unexpressed.

Here we stand, take my hand.

God, I'm distressed.

How I love you.



(Jason)

I hate the world!



(Trina)

He hates everything!



(Jason)

I love my dad!



(Mendel)

He loves his father.



(Jason)

I love the things I've never had.



(Trina and Mendel)

Love our family.



(Jason)

Lord, hear our call!



(Mendel) (overlapping)

Help us all.



(Trina)

Help us all.



(Jason)

Helps us all.



(Mendel)

Help us all.



(Trina, Mendel, and Jason)

Help us all!



(Whizzer)

I never wanted to love you.

I never wanted, 'till death do we two part.'

Condescend, stay my friend.

How do I start,

Not to love you'



(Trina)

I'm everything he wanted.

It's time I put it all together.

My hands were tied.

My father cried,

'You'll marry!'

I married!



(Trina and Jason, overlapping)

He's mine!

He's mine!



(Marvin)

I never wanted to love you.

I only wanted to see my face in yours.

Jason smiled, save this child.

How he adores, and hates me-



It really killed me when you took those vows.

Don't misunderstand, I'm in command!

Anyhow, we're through!

I never wanted,

I wanted-

I never, never, never, never,

Never, never wanted to love you!

I never wanted to love you!

I never wanted to love you!

I never wanted to love you!



(All, overlapping)

Love you!
