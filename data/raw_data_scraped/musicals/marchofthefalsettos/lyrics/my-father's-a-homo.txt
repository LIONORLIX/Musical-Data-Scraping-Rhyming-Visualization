My Father's A Homo


JASON

My father?s a homo

My mother?s not thrilled at all

Father homo:

What about chromo-

Some?

Do they carry?

Will they carry?

Who?s the homo now?

My father said that one day I?ll grow to be president

And that idea?s not so wild

I don?t live the life of a normal child

?Cause I?m too smart for my own good

And I?m too good for my sorry little life

My mother?s no wife

And my father?s no man

No man at all
