Act 1 - Finale: Horton Sits On The Egg


BIRD GIRLS

Then carefully, tenderly,

Gently he crept

Up the trunk to the nest

Where the little egg slept.

Then Horton the elephant smiled:



HORTON

Now that's that.



BIRD GIRLS

And he sat and he sat

And he sat and he sat.



He sat all that day

And he kept the egg warm...

And he sat all that night

Through a terrible storm...



(The CAT enters and gleefully squirts HORTON with a water pistol)



BIRD GIRLS

Ooh...Ahh!



HORTON

I'm cold and I'm wet

And I'm catching the flu.

Oh, Mayzie, please hurry!

I've got to save Who!

Oh, Mayzie, please hurry!

I've got to save Who!



(The season changes. THE CAT dumps autumn leaves on HORTON.

GERTRUDE McFUZZ enters.

Her tail is now extremely long - in fact, some of it still remains offstage)



GERTRUDE

Horton, I brought you a scarf.



HORTON

Thank you, Gertrude. Have you heard from Mayzie?



GERTRUDE

She sent a card from Palm Beach.



HORTON

Palm Beach! Gertrude, what if she never comes back?



GERTRUDE

Don't worry, she will. Um, Horton, notice anything different?



HORTON

Yes, it's g-g-g-getting colder.



(GERTRUDE sighs and exits. HORTON still doesn't notice her tail,

which crosses the stage long after she's gone)



BIRD GIRLS (& OTHER WOMEN O.S.)

Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!...A-aah!



BIRD GIRLS

And then came the winter..

The snow and the sleet

And icicles hung

From his trunk and his feet,

Ooh!...



(THE CAT hurls buckets of snow at HORTON)



HORTON (resolute)

I can't leave this nest.

No, I meant what I said.

This egg might get frozen

But the Whos might be dead!

I couldn't say no

When I heard Mayzie beg

Now I'm caught between a dust speck

And an incubating egg!



(Suddenly, HUNTERS surround HORTON)



Help! Someone help! Hunters! Help!



(There is chaos in the jungle. GERTRUDE tries to fly to HORTON'S aid,

but can't because of her heavy tail. She wrestles with it)



GERTRUDE

Horton! ... Horton!



(Musical intro as THE CAT IN THE CAT enters and freezes the terrifying tableau.

Instead of singing, THE CAT tips the song to HORTON, who unfreezes.

His attitude changes immediately from terror-stricken to blithe.)



HORTON

When your life's going wrong

And you're wondering why



(GERTRUDE unfreezes and sing cheerfully.)



GERTRUDE

When your tail is so long

You're unable to fly!



CAT & HORTON & GERTRUDE

Tell yourself how lucky you are.



(Lights come up on JOJO, "after the fall", a little banged up.)



JOJO

When you land with a thud

And you're bumped and you're bruised,



HORTON

When you're trapped



GERTRUDE

And you're grounded



JOJO, HORTON, GERTRUDE

And lost and confused!



JOJO, HORTON, GERTRUDE, CAT

Tell yourself how lucky you are!



(Lights come up on the MAYOR, MRS.

MAYOR, CITIZENS OF WHO and GENERAL GENGHIS KHAN SCHMITZ with JOJO.

All are bandaged, battered and on crutches, but despite this, cheerfully "showbiz")



WHOS

Why rehash a nasty crash.

Why call a hearse

Or curse the universe!

My philosophy is simply:



WHOS

Things could be worse!



(SFX: Thunder!)



ALL (EXCEPT WHOS) WHOS

So be happy you're here. Who...

Think of life as a thrill! Who...

And if worse comes to worse, Who...



ALL

As we all know it will,

Thank your lucky star

You've gotten this far...



CAT

It's time for a brief intermission.





ALL

Which means Act One is through!



CAT

So go have a nice intermission.

(The lobby's a real zoo!)

But we've gotta fix up the stage

And get ready to play Act Two!



GROUP 1 WHOS

Tell yourself

How lucky you are... How lucky! How lucky!

how lucky you...

How lucky you are... How lucky! How lucky!

how lucky you...

How lucky you are... How lucky! How lucky!

how lucky! How lucky!

how lucky!

How lucky you are! How lucky you are!



Tell yourself

How lucky you are... How lucky! How lucky!

how lucky you...

How lucky you are... How lucky! How lucky!

how lucky you...

How lucky you are... How lucky! How lucky!

how lucky! How lucky!

how lucky!

How lucky you are! How lucky you are!



CAT

How lucky you are!



(The CAT makes a magical exit.)
