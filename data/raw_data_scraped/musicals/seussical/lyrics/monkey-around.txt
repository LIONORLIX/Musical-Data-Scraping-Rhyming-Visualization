Monkey Around


WICKERSHAMS

Yeah!



WICKERSHAM #1

There's a rustle in the bushes.

There's a tremble in the trees.

Hear it like a whisper

Smell it on the summer breeze.



WICKERSHAMS

Mm-hmm!



WICKERSHAM #1 WICKERSHAMS #2, 3

Somethin' big is getting nearer Ooh ...mm-hmm!

Somethin' big is comin' through Ooh ...mm-hmm

Got some monkey business Ah ...



WICKERSHAMS

That's what we intend to do...

WICKERSHAMS

Come on!

I wanna monkey,

Monkey around

Come on!

I gotta monkey

Monkey around

Come on!

We're gonna monkey

Ooh, we're gonna monkey around! Ooh!

A dust speck that's all full of Whos who are not!



WICKERSHAM #3
