Amazing Mayzie


MAYZIE

Poor little Gertrude!

A sorry sight!

Well, I'm gonna take you under my wing

And baby, you'll be all right!



I was once a plain little bird like you, kid.

One pathetic feather was all I grew.

I had nothing showoff-ish.

What's a plain bird to do?

And there's certainly nothing showoff-ish on you!



GERTRUDE

Thank you, Mayzie



MAYZIE

Then I made a plan for my self-improvement

No more crumbs. I vowed I would have the cake!

Yes, I went to the doctor-



GERTRUDE & BIRD GIRLS

Doctor Dake by the lake!



MAYZIE

And he told me

What sort of a pill I should take...

Now I'm ......

Amayzing Mayzie!

As feathered as feathered can be now!

Amayzing Mayzie!

It was all for sale!



MAYZIE & BIRD GIRLS

Amayzing Mayzie!



MAYZIE

The birds are all whistling at me now.



MAYZIE & BIRD GIRLS

Amayzing Mayzie!



MAYZIE

Baby, that's my tail!



(MAYZIE begins to dance, flaunting her tail. GERTRUDE watches in awe.)



BIRD GIRLS

High or low



GERTRUDE

Gee, it's fabulous!



BIRD GIRLS

Watch her go



GERTRUDE

Gee, I'm envious!



BIRD GIRLS

To and fro,-

Mayzie's fabulous tail!



GERTRUDE

I wish I had one like it.



BIRD GIRLS

Left and right



GERTRUDE

Best I've ever seen.



BIRD GIRLS

Day or night



MAYZIE

Kid, you're turning green!



GERTRUDE & BIRD GIRLS

What a sight-

Mayzie's fabulous tail!



MAYZIE BIRD GIRLS

Get those pills

Get the pills

And you can have frills

Frills!



MAYZIE & BIRD GIRLS

For all the world to see.

And you can be amayzing-



MAYZIE

Almost...

As amayzing...

As me!!!



(MAYZIE exits with flare.)
