Oh, The Thinks You Can Think


A strange red-and-white-striped hat sits on a very empty stage.

A BOY (who will later play JOJO) enters and notices it.



BOY

Now that is a very unusual hat.

I wonder what's under a hat such as that.

It could be a creature they call the Ga-Zat

Who balances things on his head, cause it's flat.

Or a stripe-loving Pipester from Upper Mount Bat.

Or a sort of a kind of a hat-wearing...

Cat!



(THE BOY picks up the hat, and THE CAT IN THE HAT suddenly appears)





CAT IN THE HAT

I can see that you've got quite a mind for your age!

Why, one Think and you dragged me right onto the stage!

Now, I'm here, there is no telling what may ensue

With a Cat such as me, and a Thinker like you!



(THE CAT begins to "create" the Seussian world of imagination for THE BOY)



After all those years stuck on a page,

Did you ever imagine, you'd see me, on stage?

Now I'm here, there is no telling what may ensue.

No, there is no telling what.

But ill give you a clue.



Oh, the thinks you can think!

Oh, the thinks you can think

If you're willing to try...



Think invisible ink!

Or a gink with a stink!

Or a stair to the sky...

If you open your mind,

Oh, the thinks you will find

Lining up to get loose...

Oh, the thinks you can think

When you think about...



(The company of "Seussian" characters now enters)



CAT, ALL (except BOY)

Seuss! Seuss!

Seuss! Seuss!

Seuss! Seuss! Seuss! Seuss!

Seuss!



CAT & ALL (except BOY)

Oh, the thinks you can think!

Any thinker who thinks

Can come up with a few!

And the darkness of night

Oooh Oooh...

All alone in your room

As you're facing your doom



CAT (spoken)

Think a glimmer of light!!



ALL (except BOY)

(with relief)

Aah Aah!



CAT

But I hope you're prepared

To be scareder than scared!



CAT, ALL (except BOY)

'Cause this ain't mother goose!

Think right over the brink!



CAT, ALL (except BOY)

When you think about Seuss!

CAT

An unusual story will soon be unfurled

Of an elephant trying to save a small world

And a boy from that world who has Thinks just like you!



CAT IN THE HAT, ALL

Just think!



WHOS

From the Planet of Who



BOY

And the smallest of small.



CITIZENS OF THE JUNGLE

To the jungle of Nool,



HORTON

And the largest of all...

CAT

Our story begins

With a very strange sound -

The drums of a jungle

Beginning to pound.



(Jungle drums begin.)

CAT

Now, imagine a sky.



BOY

I'll imagine bright blue!



(BOY and CAT create a blue sky and a jungle setting.)



CAT

It's the Jungle of Nool!



BOY

Near the River Walloo!



(The CAT and the BOY watch as the Jungle of Nool is revealed.

The JUNGLE CITIZENS enter, along with the BIRD GIRLS,

a flamboyant "girl group" of the jungle.)
