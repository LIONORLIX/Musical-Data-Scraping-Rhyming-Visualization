It's Possible (In McElligot's Pool)


JOJO

This might be a pool,

Like I've read of in books,

Connected to one of those underground brooks!

An underground river

That starts here and flows

Right under this bathtub!

And then-

Who knows!



It's possible!

Anything's possible!



JOJO, CAT

It's possible!

Anything's possible!



(JOJO's imagination starts to expand.)



JOJO

It might go along,

Down where no one can see

Right under state highway

Two hundred and three!

Right under the wagons!

Right under the toes

Of Mrs. Umbroso! ...

Who's hanging out clothes!



It's possible!

Anything's possible.



JOJO, CAT

It's possible!

Anything's possible!



JOJO

This might be a river

Now mightn't it be,

Connecting McElligot's Pool with the sea!

Then maybe some fish might be swimming...

Swimming toward me!



(We are suddenly underwater.

Strange fish appear - all shapes and sizes, wildly-coloured and wildly improbable.

The FISH dance and swoop through the water in a "water ballet" with JOJO)



FISH FALSETTO GROUP

Ah! Oo-wee-ee-ee-ee-ooh!

It's possible!

It's possible...

Ah! Oo-wee-ee-ee-ee-ooh!

It's possible

It's possible...

Ah!



JOJO FISH

Oh, the sea is so full Ooh ... Wah-ooh ...

Of a number of fish

If a fellow is patient Ooh ... Wah-ooh ...

He might get his wish!

And that's why I think Ooh ... Wah-ooh ...

That I'm not such a fool

When I sit here and fish When I sit here and fish

In McElligot's pool!



It's possible. It's possible

It's possible

Anything's

Possible. Possible.



It's possible. It's possible

It's possible

Anything's

Possible. Possible.



It's possible...

Anything...

Anything...



(JOJO's parents abruptly interrupt his fantasy.)



MR. MAYOR

Jojo! The tub's overflowed on the floor!

The water is running right under the door!



MRS. MAYOR

The ceiling is peeling! You've flooded the den!

Oh, JoJo, I think you've been Thinking again!



MR. MAYOR

I say this with firmness and terrible sorrow,

Young man, we will deal with you come tomorrow!



(MR. and MRS. MAYOR exit)



JOJO

I still think

That I'm not such a fool

When I sit here and fish

In McElligot's pool!



CAT

It's possible.



(The FISH magically re-appear)



JOJO, CAT & FISH

Anything's ...

Possible!



(Lights out on JOJO, as JOJO's PARENTS appear.)
