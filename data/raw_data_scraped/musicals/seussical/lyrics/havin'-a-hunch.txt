Havin' A Hunch


SCARY VOICES (Offstage)

Ooh! Wah-ooh-wah!

Ooh! Wah-ooh-wah!



CAT

Have you ever had a hunch

You should follow your nose?

Then you have a sudden hunch

You should follow your toes?

Soon a sneaky hunch is whispering

Better go straight!

And before you know it

Oh, it's so late late late late!



SCARY VOICES (Echoing)

Late late late late!



CAT

Now a nervous hunch is telling you

You could be lost!



SCARY VOICES (Echoing)

Lost lost lost lost...



CAT

As it leads you down a path

You have already crossed.





SCARY VOICES (Echoing)

Crossed, crossed, crossed, crossed!



CAT

Soon you're overwhelmed by hunches

That pester and pinch and punch!

And you know you're havin' a hunch!



(The mysterious HUNCHES enter)



HUNCHES

You're havin', you're havin' a hunch!



CAT

A hunch!



HUNCHES

You're havin' a hunch!



HUNCHES

You're havin', you're havin' a hunch!

You're havin' a hunch!



(A DREAM nightmare ensues, in which all kinds of strange

Seussian creatures and events challenge and scare JOJO.)



HUNCHES

Ooh! Ah!



HUNCHES, CAT

Hunch!



HUNCHES

Ooh! Ah!



HUNCHES, CAT

Hunch!



HUNCHES

Ooh! Ah! Hunch!

Ooh! Ah! Hunch!



(At the height of his fright and confusion, JOJO confronts THE CAT.)

JOJO

You're nothing but trouble! Just trouble galore!

You flooded my house, sent me marching to war.

Filled my head full of Thinks!

And you won't go away!



CAT

All right. I'll be going.

But first, let me say...



JOJO

No!



CAT

Think of nobody here

And the feeling of fear

And the darkness of night



HUNCHES

Ooh Ooh...



ALL, CAT

All alone in the gloom

As you're facing your doom



CAT

Think a glimmer of light!



(THE CAT turns on a light, and the HUNCHES are revealed as just a bunch of actors in costume.

They're a little sheepish to be caught in the act. JOJO is amazed and relieved.)



JOJO

You mean, that's it?



CAT

That's it. It's all in your mind.

You're a Thinker, JoJo.

Tried and true.

I don't often meet real Thinkers like you.



JOJO

I want to go home.



CAT

What, that's easy to do!

Just follow your Hunches.

They'll lead you home to Who.



Think a bridge to the shore

And a road to your door.

You'll be home before lunch!



JOJO

Oh, the places I'll go

If I follow my...



JOJO, HUNCHES

Hunch!



HUNCHES, CAT

Follow your Hunch!



(The HUNCHES and CAT now help JOJO to find his way home)



And oh!

The places you'll go!



JOJO

I've got brains in my head

And feet in my shoes



ALL (EXCEPT JOJO)

So steer yourself any direction you choose!



And oh, the places you'll go!

Set your hunches free to wander

And follow them where they roam



HUNCHES, CAT

And follow your hunch

Follow your hunch

Follow it...



Follow your hunch

Follow your hunch

Follow it .. .



Follow your hunch

Follow your hunch

Follow it



(The CAT and JOJO'S HUNCHES magically deliver JOJO home to his PARENTS.)



HUNCHES, OFFSTAGE VOICES

Home ...



(Parents and son embrace joyfully)



ALL

Anything's possible!



(In the darkness, we see a figure carrying a flashlight.

Its light reveals GERTRUDE McFUZZ)



GERTRUDE

I'll bet you forgot about Gertrude McFuzz

Well, that's nothing new. I mean, everyone does.

But Gertrude did something that few birds could do.

So this is the Tale of Miss Gertrude. Part Two.



(GERTRUDE's flashlight picks out the poster for the Circus McGurkus.

We hear the sounds of snoring)



Psst! Horton! Horton!



HORTON

What is it? Who's there?



GERTRUDE

It's me, Gertrude! Horton! OH, Horton! I was so worried Are you all right?



HORTON

Gertrude! How did you find us?



GERTRUDE

Well, it's a long story
