All For You


GERTRUDE

I had a little trouble

'Cause I grew a little tail.

Well, it wasn't really little.

It was absolutely giant!

And it really was attractive

But you never even noticed,

So I felt a little silly even trying

Besides which the tail was too heavy

For normal flying.



HORTON

Go on.



GERTRUDE

Well, when the hunters caught you

I could see that I'd been foolish

'Cause I couldn't even help you

No, I couldn't even fly.

And I got so very frightened

'Cause I knew I had to save you.

No one else was gonna go to all the labor.

It was all up to me,

All you had was your next door neighbor.



(THE CAT as DR. DAKE enters.)



GERTRUDE

So I ran to the doctor.



CAT AS DR. DAKE

The doctor named Dake.

And she said.-



GERTRUDE

My tail has been a mistake!



CAT AS DR. DAKE

And she said:



GERTRUDE

Dr. Dake, I've been foolish and vain.



Pluck it out! Get it off!

I won't do it again!



CAT AS DR. DAKE

Pluck! Pluck! Pluck!



GERTRUDE

Ouch, it hurt a lot!



CAT AS DR. DAKE

Pluck! Pluck! Pluck!



GERTRUDE

Ooh, a tender spot



CAT AS DR. DAKE

Pluck! Pluck! Pluck!



GERTRUDE

Just a one feather tail...



DR. DAKE, GERTRUDE & BIRD GIRLS

But suddenly, Gertrude could sail!



GERTRUDE (dramatically)

I sailed on a junk

And was practically sunk

For you.

I trampled thorough the trees

Full of furious bees

For you.

I slogged through a fog

And a choking smog

Down a soggy slope

Through a stinking bog

While my slip was gripped

By a vicious dog

For you.



GERTRUDE BIRD GIRLS

I galloped through the snow ooh...

In eleven below

For you.

ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Yes, even though I knew ooh...

I was catching the flu

For you

(achoo!) (achoo!)

And then came the hole ooh

Where I caught my sole ooh

And I rolled downhill ooh

Out of all control ooh

'Till I broke my fall

On a jagged shoal

For you!

ooh, ooh, ooh, ahh!

All for you

All for you

All for you

All for you

There's nothing that I

Wouldn't

And I couldn't

And I haven't gone through...

ahh, aah, aah, aah!



(With tremendous conviction and grit!)



I sprained my little toe, but la-la-la-la-la!

I hobbled like so la-la-la-la!

For you. La-la-la-la-la-la-la!

ooh ... Ooh ... Ooh

Then came the hit and run la-la-la-la-la!



But I staggered on one la-la-la-la!

For you. La-la-la-la-la-la-la!

Now, here I am, ahh-ah!

The worse for wear

And here you are ahh-ah!

I'm here!

You're there!

And maybe now ah!

You'll know I care ahh-ah!

For you! Ooh!

ooh ...



GERTRUDE

Oh, yes. And Horton, one more thing...



It took me seven weeks...

But I found your clover,

Too!



(HORTON eagerly takes the clover from GERTRUDE)



HORTON, DR. DAKE & BIRD GIRLS

WHO!



HORTON

Gertrude...I never noticed...you're...Amazing!



GERTRUDE

Aw, it was nothing.



HORTON

Hello, Whos, hello! Is anyone there?



(HE holds the clover to his ear and gets an answer as MR. MAYOR, MRS.

MAYOR appear)



MRS. AND MRS. MAYOR

Hello!!



HORTON

Oh, what a relief! Why, hello, Mr. Mayor! Is JoJo all right?



(HE listens again)



JOJO

Hi, Horton!



HORTON

Oh, JoJo! Hello!

Kid, now that I've got you, I won't let you go!

I'll shelter and guard you, because after all,

A person's a person

No matter how small!



MR. AND MRS. MAYOR, JOJO, HORTON, GERTRUDE

A person's a person

No matter how...



(THE CAT IN THE HAT interrupts this tender moment with a whistle.)



CAT

How happy and sweet...but this tale is not over!



JOJO

Oh yes it is, too! Get me down from this clover!



CAT

I'm sorry, there's no happy ending in sight!

So all I can say is - Hey, JoJo, hold tight!



(THE WICKERSHAM BROTHERS

and the SOUR KANGAROO/YOUNG KANGAROO appear)



WICKERSHAM #1

Ha!



WICKERSHAM #2,3

Ha!



SOUR KANGAROO

Humph!



GERTRUDE

How did you get here?!



SOUR KANGAROO

You can't run away from a sour kangaroo

Palm Beach to Pittsburgh to Kalamazoo

And you - with your egg and your tree and your nest!

I'm making a sour citizen's arrest!



HORTON

Wait! Stop! Where are you taking me?



SOUR KANGAROO & WICKERSHAMS

Well Horton, we're taking you back.

You're gonna be goin' in style.

For talkin' to a speck

And sittin' on an egg



WICKERSHAM #3

You're gonna be...



WICKERSHAM #2

Gonna be...



WICKERSHAM #1

Gonna be...



SOUR KANGAROO

Gonna be...



SOUR KANGAROO & WICKERSHAMS

Gonna be put...

On trial!
