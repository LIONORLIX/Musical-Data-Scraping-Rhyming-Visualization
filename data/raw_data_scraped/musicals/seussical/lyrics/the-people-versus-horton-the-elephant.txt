Lock me up in a zoo...

But I won't desert my egg

And I will not abandon Who!

They live in fear.

And I'm the only friend they've got



You can do what you want with me, Your Honor,

And I won't question why.



But Please save Who,

The ti-niest planet in the sky.

Now surely you heard. It was clear as a bell!

Now all of you surely heard that very well!



(No one else has heard a thing)



JUDGE YERTLE

I heard no small voices

And you didn't either!



(SOUR KANGAROO riffs through the following)



COURTROOM MEN COURTROOM WOMEN

(HORTON struggles to protect THE WHOS from the mob, holding the clover away from them)

A person's a person, no matter how small!

And you very small persons will not have to die

If you make yourselves heard! So, please! TRY!

They beat on tom toms, play musical instruments, wave their arms.)

(Everyone freezes as THE CAT steps out of the scene.)



CAT

Now just for a moment, young Jojo looked grim.

The fate of the Whos rested squarely on him!

But then came a think.-

A peculiar new word no one ever had heard!



(The scene unfreezes...)



ALL (IN COURTROOM) WHOS

Boil it! We are here!

Boil it! We are here!

Boil it! We are here!

Boil!... We are here!



JOJO (a long yell)

YOPP!



(JOJO'S voice reverberates loudly through the universe.

And the WHOS are heard at last. The ANIMALS gasp in amazement.

The WHOS gasp in relief!)
