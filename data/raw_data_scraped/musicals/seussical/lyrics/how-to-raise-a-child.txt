How To Raise A Child


MRS. MAYOR

He was Mommy's little boy.



MR. MAYOR

He was Daddy's little man.



BOTH

He was never any trouble till this...

"Thinking Thing" began!



MR. MAYOR

We must both lay down the law.



MRS. MAYOR

Will he hate us?



MR. MAYOR

Maybe so.



MAYOR & MRS. MAYOR

Oh, where are the instructions

On how to raise a child?

Who has the instructions

On how to raise a child?

Who has all the answers?

I don't know.



(The CAT pops up and hands them a brochure.)



MRS. MAYOR (Reading)

Does your child give you troubles?

Do his grades keep on shrinking?



MR. MAYOR (Reading)

Does he drive teachers wild

With his uncontrolled thinking?



MR. & MRS. MAYOR (Reading)

As a parent, are you

Overwhelmed? Insecure?

The help that you seek

Is inside this brochure!



(An alarm clock goes off, loudly. JOJO's parents put on big, cheerful smiles and wake him)



MAYOR

It's nine, son.

Rise and shine, son,

It's a very special day!



MRS. MAYOR

Get dressed, dear.

Look your best, dear.

Soon you will be on your way.



MAYOR

Now, here is your pencil.





MRS. MAYOR

Here are your mittens.



MAYOR & MRS. MAYOR

Here is your sword --



JOJO

My...sword?



(The CAT IN THE HAT blows a fanfare as

GENERAL GENGHIS KAHN SCHMITZ arrives grandly.)



SCHMITZ

I'm General Genghis Kahn Schmitz.

I scare children out of their wits.

But you'll see at a glance, sir,

My school is the answer

For shirkers and dreamers and twits...

And in this case, I'd say the shoe fits!



Ten hut! Feet together. Chin up. Eyes on the prize, forward ... Harch!



(JOJO begins to march in place.)
