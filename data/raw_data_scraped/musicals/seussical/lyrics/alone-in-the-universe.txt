Alone In The Universe


HORTON

I've been guarding this clover

For over a week,

Getting laughed at

For thinking a dust speck can speak.

Well, let them all laugh

I'll try not to mind,

For I have found something

That they'll never find!



There are secrets on a leaf,

In the water, in the air,

Hidden planets, tiny worlds,

All invisible!

Not a person seems to know.

Not a person seems to care.

There is no one who believes a thing I say...



Well, I'm fairly certain

At one time or other,

Great thinkers all feel this way!



I'm alone in the universe.

So alone in the universe.

I've found magic but they don't see it



They all call me a lunatic.

Ok, call me a lunatic.

If I stand on my own, so be it.



'Cause I have wings.

Yes, I can fly

Around the moon

And far beyond the sky

And one day soon

I know there you'll be

One small voice in the universe

One true friend in the universe

Who believes in me...



JOJO HORTON

I'm alone in the universe.

So alone in the universe.

My own planets and stars

Are glowing.

Alone in the universe

No one notices anything.

Not one person is listening.

They don't have any way of knowing.

Nobody knows that

I have wings

I have wings.

Yes, I can fly

I can fly

Around the moon

And far

Beyond the sky Beyond the sky



BOTH

Well someday soon

You will hear my plea



HORTON

One small voice in the universe



JOJO

One true friend in the universe



BOTH

Please believe in me ...



HORTON (softly, to his clover)

Hello...hello?



JOJO (startled)

Hello?



HORTON (startled as well)

Who's there?



JOJO

It's me, Jojo. The Mayor's son.



HORTON

I'm Horton. The Elephant



JOJO

Are you real, or are you a very large think?



HORTON

Oh, I'm real, all right. I would state that in ink.



JOJO

In my thinks, I imagine a lot of strange things

And I go to strange places, as if I had wings!

I love a good think!



HORTON

Well, for me that goes double.



JOJO

Sometimes my thinks are what get me in trouble.



HORTON

When you think, do you dream?



JOJO

In bright colors!



HORTON

Me too. And I go to strange places

Like Solla Sollew!



JOJO

When you think, do you think

You could fly to the stars?



HORTON

Little friend, no one else

Could have thinks such as ours!



(HORTON and JOJO imagine they are flying through the starry universe.)



HORTON JOJO

Yes, I have wings.

I have wings

And I can fly

I can fly ...

Around the moon

And far beyond the sky Beyond the sky ...

You called my name

And you set me free-

One small voice in the universe



JOJO

One true friend in the universe



BOTH

Who believes in me.



HORTON

Goodnight Jojo.



JOJO

Goodnight Horton. See you in Solla Sollew!



(HORTON exits and JOJO goes to sleep. Suddenly,

THE CAT pops up behind JOJO's bed and shakes him awake.)



CAT

Wake up! The scene's over!

There's more to be heard.

There goes our hero. Who enters?



JOJO

The bird!



(GERTRUDE McFUZZ enters, carrying a small guitar.)



GERTRUDE

"Love Song for Horton" Four Hundred and Thirty-Seven.



(GERTRUDE begins to play and sing.)
