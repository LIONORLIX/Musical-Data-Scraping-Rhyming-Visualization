How Lucky You Are (Mayzie's Reprise)


MAYZIE

(improvised vocal scat)

Da da da da da da da...



I was down in Fort Worth,

Just a girl on the wing,

When I met Tweet McFirth.

Oh, could that night owl sing!

Tell yourself

How lucky you are!



CAT (AS PIANIST)

How lucky, how lucky you are-



MAYZIE

It was three weeks of bliss.

Then the usual segue:

He flew off to San Juan

Leaving me with his egg!

Tell yourself

How lucky you are!



CAT (AS PIANIST)

How lucky you are!



MAYZIE

Now I'm bored and

I'm cranky and tired

Sitting day after day.

Who knew so much work was required?!

I'd much rather play!

I need a vacation!

I'm due for some rest-

Hey, Horton, would you maybe like to sit on my nest-?





HORTON

Why, Mayzie I couldn't. Of all silly things!

I haven't got feathers. I haven't got wings.

And not only that, but I'm here on a search.

I just couldn't leave my poor Whos in the lurch!



MAYZIE

I won't be gone long, kid. I give you my word.

I'll hurry right back, 'cause I'm that sort of bird!

Oh, Horton, I promise! I'll fly back real soon.

I'd only be gone for, say, one afternoon!



(A beat, as HORTON considers this)



HORTON (relenting)

Well, we all need vacations.

All right go on, take it

I'll sit on your egg

And I'll try not to break it

But please come back quickly-

One hour, maybe two.

I need to find Jojo.

I've got to save Who!



MAYZIE

Hit it cat!



(The CAT strikes up an energetic Latin beat on the piano,

accompanying MAYZIE as she flies off, thrilled with her newfound freedom.)



Thanks! Thanks a million! Toodle-oooo!



(The BIRD GIRLS watch as HORTON climbs the tree

with great trepidation and gingerly gets into the nest.)
