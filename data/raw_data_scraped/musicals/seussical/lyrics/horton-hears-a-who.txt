CAT

Now think of an elephant lumbering through.



(We now see HORTON THE ELEPHANT.)



CITIZENS OF THE JUNGLE

Who who wah dah

Who who who wah dah dah dah



BOY (spoken)

Horton!



CAT

Yes, Horton!



CAT & BOY

Horton Hears a Who!



HORTON

On the fifteenth of May

In the jungle of Nool

In the heat of the day,

In the cool of the pool,

He was splashing



JUNGLE CITIZENS

Splash!



HORTON

Enjoying the jungle's great joys

When Horton the elephant



BOY

Horton the Elephant



BIRD GIRLS, ALL

Horton the elephant



HORTON

Heard a small noise.



MAYOR (Offstage, distant and tiny)

Help! Help!



BIRD GIRL #1

So Horton stopped splashing

He looked toward the sound



HORTON

That's funny.



BIRD GIRLS

Thought Horton-



HORTON

There's no one around.



BIRD GIRL #3

Then he heard it again



BIRD GIRL #2

Just a very faint yelp



HORTON

As if some tiny person were calling for help



MAYOR (Offstage, distant and tiny)

Help! Help!



HORTON

I'll help you



BIRD GIRLS

Said Horton



HORTON

But who are you, and where?



BIRD GIRLS

He looked and he looked.



BIRD GIRLS, HORTON

He could see nothing there

But a small speck of dust

Blowing past...



(All follow an invisible speck of dust with their eyes, as it shoots past and stops in front of HORTON.)



HORTON, BIRD GIRLS

Through the air.



HORTON

I say! How confusing!

I've never heard tell

Of a small speck of dust that is able to yell,

So you know what I think?

Why I think that there must be someone on top of that small speck of dust.

Some poor little person

Who's shaking with fear

That he'll blow in the pool!

He has no way to steer!

He's alone in the universe!

I'll just have to save him

Because after all,

A person's a person, no matter how small.

A person's a person no matter how-



HORTON JUNGLE CITIZENS

Small... Who who wah dah

who who who wah dah dah dah

who who wah dah

who who



BIRD GIRLS # 1,2,3

So, gently, and using

The greatest of care,

The elephant stretched

His great trunk through the air,

And he lifted the dust speck

And carried it over

And placed it down,



HORTON (spoken)

Safe!



BIRD GIRLS

On a very soft clover.



(THE SOUR KANGAROO makes an impressive entrance.)
