Chasing The Whos


SOUR KANGAROO

Up out of the jungle

Up into the sky.

Up over the mountains



SOUR KANGAROO & BIRD GIRLS

Ten thousand feet high.



SOUR KANGAROO

Then down from the mountains



SOUR KANGAROO & BIRD GIRLS

And into the news-



ALL

Went Horton the elephant

Chasing the Whos!



WOMEN

Chasing the Whos!



MEN

Chasing the Whos!



(THE CAT enters as a HELICOPTER NEWSCASTER,

wearing headphones. SFX: Helicopter blades.)



CAT (AS NEWSCASTER)

This is the cat in the hat

Live from Skycam Five.

Folks, the Jungle of Nool

Is one heck of a drive.

We've got monkeys backed up

To the three-oh-two

I'd find alternate routes

If I were you!



(THE CAT "flies" off)





WICKERSHAMS, SOUR KANGAROO & BIRD GIRLS

Then over the desert,

The Desert of Dreze!

And into the forest

With thousands of trees

Past Sneetches on beaches



SOUR KANGAROO

And sour kangaroos!



ALL (except Horton & "Vocally low" men

"vocally low" men)

Went Horton the elephant

Chasing the Whos Chasing the Whos!

Chasing the...

Chasing the Whos! Chasing the Whos!



(The WICKERSHAM BROTHERS stop running and surround HORTON,

holding the clover just out of reach)



WICKERSHAM #1

Still chasing your dust?

Why it's safe as can be.



WICKERSHAM #2

We're monkeys to trust

Or don't you agree?



WICKERSHAM #3

Well, just to be sure

We are handing it off



WICKERSHAMS

To a black-bottomed eagle named--



VLAD VLADIKOFF

Vlad Vladikoff!!

(an eagle shriek)

AAAHHH!



(VLAD VLADIKOFF swoops in and grabs the clover. Horton gives chase again)



HORTON

No! Please! Wait!!



BIRD GIRLS

All that late afternoon

And far into the night

BIRD GIRLS

That black-bottomed bird

Flapped his wings in fast flight,

And he paid no attention

To Horton's loud call:



HORTON

A person's a person

No matter how small!



(We see the WHOS being swept from side to side as the eagle swoops.

JOJO is with them. They all cling to one another in terror)



WHOS (SCREAMING)

OOOH ... AAAHHH!!!



We're Whos here! We're all Whos here!

Please don't let us fall!

(screams)

Aaah!

We're Whos here. We could bruise here!

Helpless, weak and small.



CITIZENS OF THE JUNGLE, WHOS

On Horton traveled

And on that bird flew.

And, oh, there was trouble,



WHOS

Trouble on Who!



ALL (INCLUDING WHOS)

That black-bottomed eagle was cruel as could be...



HORTON

'Cause at six fifty-six, Vlad Vladikoff dropped it

The clover went tumbling and nobody stopped it!

And head over heels, one hundred miles down,

Fell the poor little Whos and their whole tiny town!



WHOS (Scream)

Aaah!



(THE CAT IN THE HAT appears in the midst of this grim moment

and blithely freezes the Whos in mid-fall)
