Alone In The Universe (Reprise)


HORTON

And now, little egg,

You're alone in the universe too.

Who would have thought you'd be left up to me,

A fool of an elephant up in a tree,

Well, this time, I swear I'll do better than try

I'll protect you from harm. Yes, I'll do it or die!

So rest now, young egg,

And I'll sing you a lullaby...

-----------------------------------------------------------------

(Reprise)



HORTON

Do you hear what I hear? Do you see what I mean?

They made themselves heard though they still can't he seen!



GERTRUDE

They've proved they are persons, no matter how small.



HORTON

And their whole world was saved by the small- est of all!



(THE SOUR KANGAROO has a change of heart and is slightly embarrassed)



SOUR KANGAROO

How true! Yes, how true! Said the sour kangaroo.

And, from now on, you know what I'm planning to do?

(with genuine sweetness)

From now on, I'm going to protect them with you!



And the young kangaroo in her pouch said...



SMALL KANGAROO

Me, too!



CAT

Their troubles were ended, they hailed his great..



ALL WHOS, CAT

Yopp!



CAT

And Jojo was honored as "Thinker non-stop".



(The WHOS carry him on their shoulders.)



MR. AND MRS. MAYOR

Now all Jojo's thinks would forever be heard.



CAT

Including this think...



(We hear the sound of a giant egg cracking.

GERTRUDE dashes over to HORTON and they watch as THE EGG hatches.

We can only imagine what they're seeing by the wonder and joy on their faces.)



JOJO, ALL (hushed wonder and amazement)

An elephant bird!



HORTON (very moved)

Why he looks just like me. Except for the wings.



GERTRUDE

And except for the voice, 'cause that's how a bird sings.



HORTON (slow mounting panic)

Gertrude, what will I do? I'm slow and I'm fat

All I know is the earth. He'll need much more than that!



(A beat.)



GERTRUDE (very tentative, very gentle)

I have wings.

Yes, I can fly.

You teach him earth

And I will teach him sky



HORTON

Just call my name



BOTH

And I'll see you through.



HORTON

One small voice in the universe



GERTRUDE

One true friend in the universe



BOTH -

Who believes in you.



(HORTON and GERTRUDE come together over the cradle,

looking down at their little elephant bird.)



CAT

The adventures were over.

The sky became...



JOJO

Pink.



CAT

And then, guess what happened?



JOJO (to audience)

Well, what do you think?!
