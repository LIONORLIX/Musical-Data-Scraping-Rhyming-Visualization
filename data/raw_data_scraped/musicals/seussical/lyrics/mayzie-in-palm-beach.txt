Mayzie In Palm Beach


MAYZIE

When you're down in Palm Beach

With the breeze in your hair

And you don't have an egg

Or a nest or a care,

Tell yourself how lucky you are.



CAT (AS JOSE THE POOLBOY or RENEE THE BEAUTICIAN)

How lucky, how lucky you are.



MAYZIE

When it's day after day

After beautiful day

To be lazing away

By the sea with Jose (Renee),

Tell yourself how lucky you are.



CAT (AS JOSE THE POOLBOY or RENEE THE BEAUTICIAN)

How lucky you are!



MAYZIE

Still, I'm bored and I'm cranky and tired

Sitting day after day.

Who knew so much work was required

For nothing but play.

I need something diff'rent!

I crave something new!

(She grabs the CAT)

Hey, maybe could you think of something diff'rent to do?!



(In self-defense, he hands her a flyer.)



MAYZIE AT THE CIRCUS



MAYZIE

A circus!

I love a show!

I think I'll go!



(MAYZIE exits as the circus enters.

SHE re-enters with souvenirs and cotton candy.

We see the circus animals, now in their cages.

Suddenly, she is face-to-face with HORTON.)



MAYZIE

Good gracious! I've seen you before- now, let's see.



HORTON

Why Mayzie, it's Horton! Remember? Its me!

I've sat on your egg now for fifty-one weeks!

I've sat here while people have paid to take peeks!

I've sat here through lightning and hail storms and snow!

Won't you take back your egg?



MAYZIE

Gee. I really don't know...



AMAYZING HORTON



MAYZIE

Oh, wow, it's really late!

And gee, I've got a date!

And lots of places to be.

But it's so great to see you!



Look at you!

Who would ever guess?

Look at you!

Such a big success...

And it's all thanks to me!



Amayzing Horton!

That egg-sitting circus sensation!

Amayzing Horton!

Even I'm impressed!

Amayzing Horton!

While I was off taking vacation



MAYZIE

You made your fortune

Up on Mayzie's nest...



I may be

Unreliable.

Fancy free.

Irresponsible.

Crazy me,

Always eager to fly.



But seeing you

Gives me true delight

Just this once

I've done something right.



The egg is all yours!

No, don't thank me,

I'll cry!



(Just for a moment, MAYZIE is actually sincere and even a little contrite.)



Good luck when it hatches.

Good luck...

And goodbye.



(MAYZIE exits hastily. The other animals look at HORTON

with sympathy as he holds the unwieldy egg in his arms)



HORTON

I meant what I said,

And I said what I meant

An elephant's faithful,

One hundred percent
