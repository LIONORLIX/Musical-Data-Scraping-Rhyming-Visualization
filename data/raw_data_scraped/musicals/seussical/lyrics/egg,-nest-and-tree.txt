Egg, Nest and Tree


SOUR KANGAROO

Up out of the jungle

Up into the sky.

Up over the mountains



BIRD GIRLS, WICKERSHAMS & SOUR KANGAROO

Ten thousand feet high.



SOUR KANGAROO & BIRD GIRLS

Then down from the mountains



BIRD GIRLS & WICKERSHAMS & SOUR KANGAROO

And down to the sea



ALL (EXCEPT HORTON)

Went Horton the elephant

Egg, nest and tree.



WOMEN

Egg, nest and tree!



MEN

Egg, nest and tree!



ALL (EXCEPT HORTON)

They loaded the wagon

Right onto a ship.

Out over the ocean

And ooh, what a trip!

Rolling and tossing

And sick as could be!



(HORTON throws up on one of the HUNTERS, who reacts!)



HORTON

Blaaggghh!



ALL

Just a seasick elephant

Egg, nest and tree.



"VOCALLY LOW" MEN

Nest and tree



ALL

Egg, nest and tree...



"VOCALLY LOW" MEN

Nest and tree



BIRD GIRL #1

After bobbing around for two weeks like a cork.



ALL (EXCEPT HORTON)

Egg, nest and tree!



BIRD GIRL #2

They landed at last

In the town of New York.



ALL (EXCEPT CAT IN THE HAT & HORTON)

Egg, nest and tree!



BIRD GIRL #3

He was wet. he was tired.

And hungry and cold.



ALL (EXCEPT HORTON)

Egg, nest and tree!



BIRD GIRLS

Then, Horton was taken to auction...



(The CAT appears as a very proper, elegant auctioneer)



CAT AS AUCTIONEER

Good evening ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Seusseby's.

Our first item up for bid this evening is lot 39,

A pendulous pachyderm on egg, nest and tree.

The bidding will begin at ten thousand dollars. Do I hear ten, ten thousand?



(NOTE: Another "free" improvisational area for

THE CAT to invite audience participation in the auction.)



CAT AS AUCTIONEER

Going once, going twice...



(The CAT bangs his gavel)



Sold...to the man with the sideburns and the greasy black mustache.

Oh, excuse me, Madame! Sold...to the man from the circus!



ALL (EXCEPT CAT & HORTON)

Sold ...

Sold ...

Sold ...

Egg, nest and tree.



(ALL exit mournfully, as HORTON is carried off. And suddenly,

THE CAT is transformed into the man from the circus

McGURKUS himself. Circus music begins)
