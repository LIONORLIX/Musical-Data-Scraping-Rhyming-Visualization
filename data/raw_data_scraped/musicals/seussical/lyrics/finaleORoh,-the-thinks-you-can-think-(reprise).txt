Finale/Oh, The Thinks You Can Think (Reprise)


ALL

Oh, the thinks you can think

Think and wonder and dream

Far and wide as you dare...

When your thinks have run dry

In the blink of an eye

There's another world there.

If you open your mind

Oh, the thinks you will find

Lining up to get loose



Oh, the thinks you can think



BASSES/BARITONES

Oh, the thinks you can think



ALL

Oh, the thinks you can think



TENORS

Oh, the thinks you can think



ALL

Oh the thinks you can think

When you think about Seuss!

When you think about Seuss!

When you think about Seuss!

(The characters dance off, fade away, disappear, one by one.

Last to go is THE CAT IN THE HAT. Finally,

THE BOY stand on an empty stage, holding his legacy,

His imagination - embodied in the red-and-white striped hat.)



BOY

Seuss!



(THE BOY pulls the CAT'S hat on, and it comes down over his eyes, causing a...

Blackout!)
