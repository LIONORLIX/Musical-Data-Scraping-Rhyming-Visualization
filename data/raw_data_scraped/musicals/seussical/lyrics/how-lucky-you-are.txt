How Lucky You Are


CAT

When the news is all bad,

When you're sour and blue,

When you start to get mad

You should do what I do-



(The CAT mischievously lets the WHOS fall a few more feet)



WHOS

Aaah!



CAT IN THE HAT

Tell yourself

How lucky you are...



When your life's going wrong

When the fates are unkind

When you're limping along

And get kicked from behind

Tell yourself how lucky you are...



(THE CAT lets the WHOS fall a little more)



WHOS

Aaah!



CAT

Why decry a cloudy sky

An empty purse

A crazy universe?

My philosophy is simply

Things could be worse!



(The CAT sniffs the clover sneezes allergically - all over THE WHOS)



AH ... AH.. AH-CHOO!



(The WHOS react in disgust at being sneezed on)



WHOS

EWWW!



CAT

So be happy you're here.

Think of life as a thrill

CAT

And if worse comes to worse

(As we all know it will)

Thank your lucky star

You've gotten this far...



We're here in this beautiful theatre -



(To a child in the audience - obviously a rich kid!)



CAT

And you're in the first row!

(To audience)

How lucky to be in the theatre!

More lucky than you know!

You could have the luck of our hero

Whose luck has been running low



FOR CERTAIN!



Curtain!



(We see the huge pink clover field into which the WHOS have dropped)



HORTON

Oh, no!



CAT

How lucky you are!

How lucky, how lucky you are!



(THE CAT, WHOS and JOJO are gone, and HORTON stands alone)



HORTON

That bird let that clover drop somewhere inside

Of a great patch of clovers, one hundred miles wide!

I'll find it, I'll find it! I'll find it or bust!

I shall find my friends on their small speck of dust.

Yes, clover by clover by clover with care

I'll listen and I'll call, are you there?

Are you there? Are you there? Are you there?



(HORTON begins his search for the WHOS clover by clover .

He picks one up, carefully puts it to his ear, listens for a beat, then tosses it over his shoulder.

He repeats this, carefully listening and then tossing.

GERTRUDE MCFUZZ enters. Her tail is now magnificent!

She sings to HORTON, but he takes no notice because he is searching for the speck of dust)
