JERRY

Breaking news! A second golden ticket has been found. And here to tell us all about it, is our mistress of all matters Wonka, Cherry Sundae. Cherry, where are you?



CHERRY SUNDAE

Jerry, I'm in England! Our winner is twelve, she likes ballet, she's the daughter of a peanut billionaire, and her name is Veruca Salt. Mr. Salt, tell all!



MR SALT

As soon as Mr. Wonka made his announcement, my Veruca expressed her very keen interest in the competition.



VERUCA SALT

I want a ticket NOW!









MR SALT

How could I possibly refuse?

When Veruca says



VERUCA SALT

More!



MR SALT

I buy another store

And when Veruca says



VERUCA SALT

Now!



MR SALT

The sweat forms on my brow

And when Veruca says



VERUCA SALT

Again!



MR SALT

No matter where or when

We'd better all count out and



VERUCA SALT

More! Now! Again!



MR SALT

When Veruca says



VERUCA SALT

Out!



MR SALT

There is no reasonable doubt

And when Veruca says



VERUCA SALT

Fetch!



MR SALT

There is no time to kvetch

And when Veruca says



VERUCA SALT

Array!



MR SALT

You'd better find a way

To make your dollar stretch for



VERUCA SALT

Out! Fetch! Array!



MR SALT

So when she heard of Wonka's prize

She started to attack

So I told my peanut shellers

Here's a tougher nut to crack

You've each a thousand Wonka bars

Start shelling them at once

For when Veruca's happy

It's much better for her pappy.



For forty days and forty nights

The ladies tried to pick it

And always to the music of



VERUCA SALT

I want a golden ticket!

I want a golden ticket!



MR SALT

And then a girl cried out

And in her hand a panacea

A golden ticket on display

And what did sweet Veruca say?



VERUCA SALT

Daddy



MR SALT

Yes?



VERUCA SALT

Buy me North Korea!



MR SALT

When Veruca says



VERUCA SALT

Buy!



MR SALT

It's like a battle cry

And when Veruca says



VERUCA SALT

Mine!



MR SALT

Well, I've jelly for a spine

And if Veruca said



VERUCA SALT

Please?



MR SALT

I'd know it was a tease before her



VERUCA SALT (Overlapping)

More! Now! Out! Mine! Fetch! Buy!



MR SALT (Overlapping)

Uh- And- Uh- Uh- Uh-



MR SALT

And when she finally falls asleep

We pray and say 'Amen'

'Till tomorrow when it all begins



VERUCA SALT

Again!



MR SALT

Again!
