If Your Mother Were Here


MR BUCKET:

Well, Charlie, there may be a hole in the roof but, maybe,

We'll see a shooting star, and we can make a wish on it!



CHARLIE:

Don't waste a wish on me.



MR BUCKET:

Oh, Charlie...



If your mother were here,

She would say, "That one's Mars."

She would hang you the moon and then she'd bottle the stars,

She would say, "Brush your teeth, is that dirt behind your ear?"

You'd be dreaming if your mother were here.



MRS BUCKET:

Evening, love.



MR BUCKET:

Evening, love!



MRS BUCKET:

How is he?



MR BUCKET:

Not good. Maybe you can cheer him up?



MRS BUCKET:

I'll see what I can do.





MRS BUCKET: (To Charlie)

Hey Charlie, let's take another look at that notebook of yours.

I want to see all your new inventions...

Charlie? Oh, Charlie...



If your father were here, you would not be in bed,

You'd be acting out the stories from the books that you've read.

He'd be walking the plank of Charlie Bucket, Buccaneer

You'd be sailing if your father were here.



MR BUCKET AND MRS BUCKET:

And if wishes were horses, we could gallop away,

And if cabbages were watches, I would the time all day.

Ah, but all we can we can offer you are dreams of every size,

So close your eyes, Charlie Bucket, close your eyes.



MR BUCKET:

Looks like he's asleep. It's getting colder tonight.



MRS BUCKET:

Oh, we'll manage!



MR BUCKET:

I'm glad he has you.



MRS BUCKET:

I'm glad he has you.



MRS BUCKET:

See you tomorrow.



MR BUCKET:

See you tomorrow.

(To Charlie)

Well Charlie, we'll need to get you another blanket, eh?



If your mother were here, she would banish the cold,



MRS BUCKET:

And your dad brings the springtime when your mum's feeling old,



BOTH:

As we're watching you grow,

Inch by inch by inch by year...



MR BUCKET:

I would thank her, if your mother were here.



Well Charlie, if you won't make a wish, then I will.
