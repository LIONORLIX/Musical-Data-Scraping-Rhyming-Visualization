News of Mike / Its Teavee Time!


MRS TEAVEE

Hello, hello, hello! Welcome. My name's Doris Teavee.

Ah, cups on doilies please. This is my husband Norman.



MR TEAVEE

What?



MRS TEAVEE

We have a prepared statement.



Oh welcome to you gentlemen

And ladies of the press

How wonderful to share this day with you

You've traveled far and wide,

Don't be shy please come inside

I've plates of petit-four and cheese fondue



The reason that you've gathered

Is to meet my little boy

The hero of the good old USA

So if you're all strapped in

Let the press conference begin

Little angel do you have something to say?



MIKE TEAVEE

Bang! Bang!

Futuristic rodeo!

See Captain Knuckleduster

Hang em' on high

Take your hard-drive, boot em' up

For a cyber shoot em' up

This is the life NOW DIE!



MRS TEAVEE

Oh, Mike is just high spirited

That's what the doctor said

He's just a mini version of my spouse



MR TEAVEE

What?



MRS TEAVEE

And they said it was a phase

When he set the cat ablaze

But the authorities request

That little Mike not leave the house



And so we let him sit at the

Computer day and night

He's promised me that he

Won't ever budge

'Cause things went from bad to worse

When he chloroformed that nurse

Darling, tell the people

What you told the judge?



MIKE TEAVEE

Hack! Hack!

I sacked the Wonka mainframe

I'm Captain Knuckleduster

I'm a super spy

Cracked his password 'goldenstar'

Never had to buy a bar

This is the life NOW DIE!



MRS TEAVEE

It was just a childhood prank

When he stole that German tank

But we never wish that we had had a daughter

Medication sets us free

One for Mike and two for me

And at six I pour a shot of mommy water



Well, it has been a pleasure

Having you inside our home

To see he's just a little boy at play

And though I break out in the sweats

When we hide his cigarettes

We've got him down to just two packs a day



And now we'll go to Wonka's

Where he'll make some brand new friends

I pray to God he fits in with the gang

But if there is no TV

It'll be like World War Three

But for now let him go out with a-



MIKE TEAVEE

Bang! Bang!

{Been playing on for fifty hours}

Watch Captain Knuckleduster

Make the losers cry



MRS TEAVEE

You can bet for sure this kid'll win



MIKE TEAVEE

Mommy, where's my ritalin?

This is the life NOW DIE!



MRS TEAVEE

Thanks for coming!
