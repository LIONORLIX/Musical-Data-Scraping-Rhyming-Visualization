It Must Be Believed to Be Seen

Willy Wonka:

Won't you help me please,

I'm afraid that I might fall

For my eyes and knees

Have grown frail behind this wall

Let me come to you

Though it appears I've lost my pep

But as this ancient relic read

In the tao of Ching it said

A journey of a thousand miles

Begins with just one step

Beyond this door's a factory

Begat from just a bean

Beyond this door

Surprises in store

But it must be believed to be seen

Beyond this door's invention

Where mind meets with machine

Beyond this gate

Astonishment waits

But it must be believed to be seen

No magic spells or potions

Forswear Legerdemain

My kingdom's created from notions

All swirling inside of my brain

Beyond this door's a banquet

Of Wonka made cuisine

A lucky few

Will get to pass through

But it must be believed to be seen

Beyond this door's music

Come dance betwixt and between

Beyond this waltz

Is a world without faults

But it must be believed to be seen

Beyond this door's a puzzle

You'll find out what i mean

Beyond this gate

Is the world i create

But it must be believed to be seen

Despite the man seen at these doors

My childhood home was bland like yours

But I knew how to look to find

A world that wasn't color-blind

Let's hope that you're a bit like me

As you walk through my factory

For in the end is quite a prize

If you can see with more than eyes

Golden ticket winners

Gloop

Teavee

Beauregard

Salt

Bucket

Your life's about to change now

So don't get left behind

Do things appear quite strange now

Imagine the wonders you'll find

Beyond this door is chocolate

So tasty it's obscene

So follow me

For I guarantee

That this world I conceived

And all I achieved

It must be believed

To be seen

Do come In.
