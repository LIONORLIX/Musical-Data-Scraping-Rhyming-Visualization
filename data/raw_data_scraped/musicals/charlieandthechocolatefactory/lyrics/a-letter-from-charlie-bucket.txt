A Letter from Charlie Bucket


CHARLIE:

Dear Mr. Wonka,

I know that you're a busy man

You must have lots of mail to read.

I'm writing for my family cause

there's nothing special that I need.

The time you take to read this letter will be time well spent,

Because I've made a list of things

You might want to invent.



MR BUCKET:

How's your homework?



CHARLIE:

Almost done.



MR BUCKET:

That's my Charlie, that's my son.



CHARLIE:

For Dad, who's always on his feet,

You might just grant me this one wish.

To keep his shoes attached to him,

Some bootstraps made of licorice!



For Josephine, I have drawn a recipe beneath for molars made of marzipan

When she can't find her teeth!



MRS BUCKET:

Have you scrubbed up?



CHARLIE:

Yes, I did.



MRS BUCKET:

That's my Charlie, that's my kid.



CHARLIE:

When I was smaller than I am,

I think one day we saw the sea.

My mum, she had an ice cream

and was happy as a mum can be.

For her I would invent an ice cream that would never melt,

So she can feel all day the way

I wish she always felt.



For Grandpa George and his Georgina,

Something not in any store.

Some pillows made of marshmallows,

To keep the noise down when they snore!



For Grandpa Joe who soon is turning

Ninety and one half,

A joke book made of jelly beans

Cause he just loves to laugh!



GRANDPARENTS:

Off to bed now,



CHARLIE:

Counting sheep.



GRANDPARENTS:

Hope we don't die in our sleep!



CHARLIE:

I think I've thought of everything

For you to add you special touch.

And when these things are all complete,

If it's not asking far too much,

Please drop them off yourself so we can ask you, "How d'ya do?"

And, well, I'd like one Wonka bar

That I would share with you.

Signed, Charlie Bucket



ALL:

Goodnight, Charlie Bucket.



CHARLIE:

Signed Charlie Bucket, inventor!
