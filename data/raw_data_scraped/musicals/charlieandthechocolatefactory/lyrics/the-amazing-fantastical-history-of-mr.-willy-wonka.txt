The Amazing Fantastical History Of Mr. Willy Wonka


CHARLIE BUCKET

Ten minutes 'till dinner? Just enough time to hear the story of Willy Wonka!



GRANDMA JOSEPHINA

Didn't we tell you the story of Willy Wonka last night?



CHARLIE BUCKET

No.



GRANDPA JOE

I have a distinct recollection of telling you  the story of Willy Wonka just last night!



GRANDPA GEORGE

And the night before that.



CHARLIE BUCKET

I don't mean to be rude Grandpa Joe, but you are getting a bit old, and well, maybe a bit forgetful.



GRANDPA JOE

Have we really never, ever, told the boy about it?



CHARLIE BUCKET

Not once!



GRANDMA JOSEPHINA

Well, for his entire life the tot has not once told a lie.



CHARLIE BUCKET

I told you so.



GRANDMA GEORGINA

But can we answer all his queries?



GRANDPA GEORGE

Can we cover all the theories?



GRANDPA JOE

All the beds are staged, so dearies-



ALL GRANDPARENTS

Let us try!



GRANDPA JOE

What a clever man he is, this Mister Wonka

There's so many tales to tell

All about the tasty sweets that made the people

Gather 'round for just one smell



GRANDPA GEORGE

Children gnawed



GRANDMA GEORGINA

While in their rompers



GRANDPA GEORGE

Chocolate eggs between their chompers



GRANDMA JOSEPHINA

'Till a tiny bird was perched upon their tongue



GRANDPA JOE

Yes Mister Willy Wonka



GRANDMA GEORGINA

Has a sex appeal what makes me feel young!

There, I said it!



GRANDPA GEORGE

Oh, you little minx!



GRANDPA JOE

From all around the world they called on Mister Wonka

King, and queens, and presidents



GRANDMA JOSEPHINA

Even down in Rome, the pope left home

And in the factory took up residence



GRANDMA GEORGINA

Dalai Llamas and their mamas

Had such episodes and dramas



GRANDPA GEORGE

Even Ghandi got himself into a brawl



GRANDPA JOE

For Mister Willy Wonka



ALL GRANDPARENTS

We all sing for he's the king of them all



GRANDPA JOE

There were sugar balloons



GRANDPA GEORGE

And macaroons



GRANDMA JOSEPHINA

On feathery sweets



GRANDMA GEORGINA

And marshmallow treats



GRANDPA JOE

Transforming wheezing geezers to a child



GRANDMA GEORGINA

And let me say that Mister Willy Wonka

Whips a swirl what makes a girl go wild

Well, he does!



CHARLIE BUCKET

Tell the one about the Indian prince! The one about Prince Pondicherry!



GRANDPA JOE

Oh, you like the scary ones, don't you Charlie?



Willy Wonka went to India

Near the kingdom of Madras

Where he met Prince Pondicherry

Who was rich but awfully crass

He had wed a Maharani

Who craved chocolate for each meal

So he called up Willy Wonka

And he said-



GRANDPA GEORGE

"Let's make a deal!

I will pay a million rupee

For a house to please her belly

We will be the talk of Punjab

And the toast of all New Delhi!"



GRANDPA JOE

"I will gladly build this fortress,"

Wonka said, "but just one thing,

It will be nice for the winter

But it won't last past the spring!"



GRANDMA JOSEPHINA AND GRANDMA GEORGINA

"For the sun will make a river

Of this chocolate Taj Mahal"



GRANDMA GEORGINA

"And you'll end up in hot chocolate

With your chocolate femme fatale!"



GRANDPA JOE

But the Prince he wouldn't listen



GRANDPA GEORGE

"Use a Bon-Bon for the dome

I won't rest until my missus

Eats me out of house and home!"



GRANDPA JOE

And so Wonka built a showplace

But when summer came around

All the walls began to melt

'Till every ceiling hit the ground



GRANDMA JOSEPHINA

But the Prince and Princess perished



GRANDPA GEORGE

Drowning in the chocolate flow



GRANDPA JOE

Yes they died 'cause they were greedy



GRANDMA GEORGINA

Ah, but what a way to go



GRANDPA JOE

Oh, but Charlie. then the spies came!



GRANDMA JOSEPHINA

Ficklegruber



GRANDMA GEORGINA

Prodnose



GRANDPA GEORGE

And Slugworth



GRANDPA JOE

Stealing every new invention as soon as it appeared. Wonka closed down he factory and no chocolate was made for a very long time. And then one night, the lights came back on again, and strange shadows appeared at the windows. Yes! The factory was up and running again! But how? Nobody's ever gone in, and nobody's ever come out. And that is one of the great mysteries of the chocolate making world.



Yes the smoke returned to the chimneys

But the gates stayed locked and chained

And strange shadows



GRANDMA JOSEPHINA, GRANDPA GEORGE, GRANDMA GEORGINA

Ghostly shadows!



GRANDPA JOE

Appeared at the window unexplained



ALL GRANDPARENTS

Yes, out went Ficklegruber,

Prodnose, Slugworth



GRANDPA GEORGE

No one went in which was quite bizarre



GRANDPA JOE

But the factory churned



GRANDMA GEORGINA

And the sweets returned



ALL GRANDPARENTS

If we could only afford one bar



So Charlie now you're up to date on Willy Wonka

Now you know what he's about

Though it's a crying shame that no one's going in

At least the chocolates still come out



GRANDPA JOE

Now once again each brother's daughter

Feels her mouth begin to water



GRANDMA JOSEPHINA

In Brazil they gave up coffee

For a taste of Wonka toffee



GRANDPA GEORGE

Now each nose would sense olfactory

Thinks the factory's satisnacktory



GRANDMA GEORGINA

For a single whiff I might commit a crime



ALL GRANDPARENTS

Yes, Mister Willy Wonka's



GRANDPA JOE

Like I said!



ALL GRANDPARENTS

A man ahead of his time



GRANDMA JOSEPHINA

I've still got it!



GRANDPA JOE

I think I slipped a disc.



GRANDPA GEORGE

I think I need a pee.



GRANDMA GEORGINA

I think I just had one.
