Opening / Almost Nearly Perfect


MISS PRATCHETT

Chocolate! Chocolate! Rots your teeth, and makes you fat. Get your lovely chocolate here.



TRAMP

Look at this mess. People just guzzle up their chocolate and throw away the wrappers without the slightest thought.



CHARLIE BUCKET

I'm glad they do that.



TRAMP

Glad?



CHARLIE BUCKET

If people didn't throw things away, I'd have nothing to pick up.



TRAMP

Very philosophical, I'm sure.







CHARLIE BUCKET

Look at this

Bent umbrella

Hardly know why you'd throw it away

I've a trick with some wire and stick

So I'll save it for a rainy day



Here's a glove

With no partner

It got lost so she tossed you aside, but

I've a date for you wooly mate

And the half-a-heaven you provide



Almost nearly perfect

Yes, it's near enough to new

Your trash is my treasure

Your good bye is my how d'ya do

How d'ya do?

How d'ya do again?

How d'ya do?

Very well then!



Here's a coin

Well it once was

Now it's a smashed penny token

But I know that my Grandpa Joe

Would say "This is only barely broken!"



Here's a tin

Let me at it

When I run everyone is a fan

Hear the roar as I kick and I score

Then my picture's on the label of the can



It's almost nearly perfect

Yes, it's near enough to new

Your trash is my treasure

Your good bye is my how d'ya do



Found a book with missing pages

Not a problem, I know how it ends

Good king Charlie in his kingdom

Lots of chocolate, lots of friends



How d'ya do

Loyal subjects

Bring me sweets, royal treats for a king

Must be pure for a connoisseur

Or executioner's axe shall swing



But 'till then

I'm just Charlie

Full of talk, but no chocolate bars

Pleasant day when I have my say

Mister Wonka will decree

Every candy shall be free

There'll Wonka chocolates falling from the stars



And that'll be absolutely perfect

Just enough to make you cry

Hear the whistle blowing

How d'ya do has to be good bye

Good bye



I'm home!
