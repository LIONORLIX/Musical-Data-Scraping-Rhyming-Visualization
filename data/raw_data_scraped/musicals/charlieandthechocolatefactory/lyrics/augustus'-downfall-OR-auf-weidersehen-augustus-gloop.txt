Mrs. Gloop

Augustus

Willy Wonka

Mr. Salt

Mr. Beauregard

Who in the name of pop are those people



Mrs. Gloop

Will they save him



Willy Wonka

No but they'll save my chocolate. Ladies and gentlemen may I introduce, The Ompa-Lompas



Ompa-Lompas

Gloop in soup, thar she blows

Slowly up the pipe he flows

To the mixing room he rises

Hope, that pipe can take all sizes

If he listened he would not be

Headed for the fudging pot but

He was not obedient

Now he is an ingredient



Mr Beauregard

Are they you're entourage Wonka?



Willy Wonka

No mr. Beauregard, their my workers



Ompa-Lompas

Cut, dice, mince, slice

Time to make the fuge

Churn, chop, pond, pop

Time to make the fuge

Snap, snip, whisk, whip

Let you're stomach be the juge

Boil, beat



One Ompa-Lompa

Hey turn up the heat



All Ompa-Lompas

Cause everyone loves fuge



Augustus

Help!



Mrs. Gloop

Augustus!



Ompa-Lompas

Auf Weidersehen Augustus Gloop

It's time to say goodbye

You great big greedy nincompoop

It's time fugify

You never tried to make a friend

But now we'll have some fun

For though you're tour is at an end

Our joy has just begun



Augustus

Momma I'm shtuck



Mrs. Gloop

Try realising some gas



Augustus

*fart*



Mrs. Gloop

Ooh



Ompa- Lompas

Ounce ground, twice pound

Time to make the fuge

Stretch, strain, cause pain

Time to make the fuge



One Ompa-Lompa

I'm tellin'g ya



All Ompa-Lompa

Sift, shake, then we bake

And stick it with a fork

Don't throw away the scraps today

Cause we love candied pork



Augustus

I feel so lonely



Ompa-Lompas

Auf Weidersehen Augustus Gloop

You're tour is now complete

You show the meaning to you group of

YOU ARE WHAT YOU EAT !



Willy Wonka

So mother courage you must show

But please don't hold a grudge

Cause as a boy he was so-so...



Wonka and Ompa-Lompas
