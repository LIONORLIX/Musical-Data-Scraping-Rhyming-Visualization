CHARLIE BUCKET

Oh! Grandpa! Look! The headline!



GRANDPA JOE

What headline?



GRANDMA JOSEPHINA

Read it Charlie.



CHARLIE BUCKET

Willy Wonka has announced an amazing competition. Find a golden ticket and you could win a dream trip to his chocolate factory, with a guided tour conducted by Mr. Willy Wonka himself!



GRANDPA JOE

Five golden tickets have been hidden inside the wrappers of five Wonka chocolate bars. Your challenge is to find one!



JERRY

Breaking news! We interrupt this programme to bring you news that the first Wonka ticket winner has been found. To find out more, let's go straight over to our chief confectionery correspondent, Cherry Sundae. Cherry, where are you?



CHERRY SUNDAE

Jerry, I'm in Bavaria! Here in this sleepy mountain town it seems like a chocolate dream has come true for local butcher's son, and three times regional bratwurst eating champion, Augustus Gloop!



MRS GLOOP

Augustus, my little pumpkin, smile for the cameras!



CHERRY SUNDAE

Augustus, how do you feel?



AUGUSTUS GLOOP

*belches*



CHERRY SUNDAE

Charming. So Mrs. Gloop...







CHERRY SUNDAE

The story of hope, how did it all begin?



MRS GLOOP

Oh when I was just a girl

I used to dream of a boy

Who would bring me lots of sweets

And be mein Schwarzwald of joy

My Herr Gloop was quite a meal

But now he seems like just a crumb

'Cause it turns out that dessert was yet to come!



So we were wed and in mein magen

Something big began to bloom

And my liver and my kidney

Had to vacate to make room

Then the blessed day arrived

And out he rolled so round and sweet

And the first words that he uttered were-



AUGUSTUS GLOOP

Let's eat!



MRS GLOOP

Ja!

So mit strudel, he'd canoodle,

How he loved my pretzel pie

He ate the whole kit and kaboodle

And grew wide as well as high

Though his size is rather shocking

He's what I was traumen of

'Cause there is more, more, more of him to love



Go ahead Augustus, don't be shy. Schpill your guts!



AUGUSTUS GLOOP

Like mein mutter und mein vater

I enjoy a healthy meal

Yes my outside's soft und flabby,

But my inside's made of steel

We raise piggies in the backyard

And I eat them limb from limb



MR GLOOP

We don't leave our dachshunds all alone with him!



MRS GLOOP

Nein!



AUGUSTUS GLOOP

So this morning I was eating

When such hunger did attack

Und fifty Wonka bars were waiting

For a nice mid-breakfast snack

But the taste was kind of different,

Like a bratwurst three days old

So I spit it out and saw I had struck gold!



Now I'm the perfect ticket winner

For on chocolate I did teeth

I am excited but keep eating

'Cause I only stop to breath

And a lifetime full of chocolate

A gesundheit  from above

And there'll be more, more, more of me to love
