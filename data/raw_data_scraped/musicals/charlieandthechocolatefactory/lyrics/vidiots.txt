MIKE TEAVEE

Hey Wonka, if you can send chocolate by TV, could you send a person too?



WONKA

I suppose so, but there might be some technical issues.



OOMPA LOOMPAS

Alas alas poor Mike Teavee

For OMG he's ADD



MIKE TEAVEE

You can't stop progress. I'm doing it!



WONKA

Uh, Mike, no!



OOMPA LOOMPAS

He's like so many nowadays

It's awfully modern this malaise



MIKE TEAVEE

Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Mike Teavee TV show!



OOMPA LOOMPAS

For every child that threw a fit

The TV set would babysit



MRS TEAVEE

Mr Wonka, where is he?



WONKA

I'm looking, I'm looking! There's so many channels.



OOMPA LOOMPAS

Attention spans have gone pal-mal

There's only time for LOL



MRS TEAVEE

The little people are singing again. That's never a good sign.



OOMPA LOOMPAS

They never step outside to play

Their world is dark both night and day



MRS TEAVEE

He's jumping from screen to screen.



WONKA

I think it's called channel hopping.



OOMPA LOOMPAS

The skies of blue, the pinks and greens

Are only viewed on laptop screens



MRS TEAVEE

Get him out of there!



MIKE TEAVEE

I'm on TV! Look at me! Look at me!



OOMPA LOOMPAS

They only move and exercise



MRS TEAVEE

What's happened to him?



OOMPA LOOMPAS

Their clicking finger and their thumb



WONKA

He's shrunk to fit the screen.



OOMPA LOOMPAS

Each brain cell overloads and dies



CHARLIE BUCKET

Will he ever go back to normal?



OOMPA LOOMPAS

As all their limbs are turning numb



WONKA

No one ever goes back to normal after they've been on television.

Vidiots

They're just vidiots



The age of innocence is gone

When certain sites are clicked upon

The images that they repeat

Once in their brain you can't delete

And then like some barbaric Huns

Our toddlers all are packing guns

And children curse and smoke cigars

Our nurseries now have prison bars



They scream and rant and raise their fists

And fire their psychiatrists

We hear them all the teenage hordes

They scream their battle cry "WE'RE BORED!"!

Their minds will surely turn to mush

With words that make an ex-con blush

They never mind their Ps and Qs

They long for piercings and tattoos

Vidiots

They're just vidiots



WONKA

It's years since I've been to a rave!



OOMPA LOOMPAS

With all this info at a click

A book will rot upon the shelf

If all the answers come too quick

A child won't think for himself

Each day they text on their new toy

Their thoughts and their location

But OMG will this destroy

The art of conversation?



So sing the story Mrs. T.

What's now become of Mike Teevee



MRS TEAVEE

For wasting his entire brain!



OOMPA LOOMPAS

He's stuck inside his own domain

He'll channel surf till where upon

He'll find that nothing good is on



MRS TEAVEE

And there is no remote control



OOMPA LOOMPAS

That he can use to find his soul

His secrets now are yours and mine

'Cause everything he's got online



MRS TEAVEE

And who will watch just Mike Teevee



OOMPA LOOMPAS

When there is newer junk to see

What once was viral soon forgot



MRS TEAVEE

But hand the clicker to his mom



OOMPA LOOMPAS

His future's not completely shot

His new address is Mike.com
