Welcome to Wisconsin


Richie Cunningham:

Dateline, 1959. This is Edward R. Murrow. Tonight, I`m reporting from Milwaukee,

Wisconsin`where there`s nothing to report. Actually, I`m Richie Cunningham

and this is an Ace Bran comb.

But the rest of it is true!

We might be square but there`s a whole world out there that`s hip and happening!



The decade`s ending, it`s a whole new deal

We`re graduating, life`s getting real

And they say the world is shrinking,

That the rules are changing fast,

Better memorize things as they are

It`s a world that may not last



Right now, this is where I live. In a perfect house with a perfect lawn,

with my perfect mid-west family.



Howard:

Calm down, Joanie! Why can`t you be more like your brother Richard`



Joanie:

But you wouldn`t have to drive me to baton twirling lessons if I had a car!



Marion:

Your father`s going to buy you a car, dear.

Just as soon as he finds one with no backseat!



Richie:

I`m Richie Cunningham

I`ll document these days

Of hoo-la-hoops and poodle skirts

The latest TV craze

I`ll write of old Milwaukee

And I`ll always write the truth

About this frozen city

Where I shiver through my youth



I graduate high school in a few weeks,

and then I am out of here. I`m blowing this pop stand and going to see the world! Until then,

I know just where to go to find out what`s happening in this town.

The center of all communication. London has the BBC, New York has the Times`

We have Arnold`s!



Teens:

Sock hops, soda pop

Meeting at the malt shop

Part of growing up around here

Welcome to Wisconsin

Make yourself to home



Richie:

Make mine malted with two straws!



Teens:

Duck tails, rock n` roll

Learning how to do the stroll

We missed you at rehearsal yesterday.



Richie:

These are my friends, Ralph and Potsie.



Chachi:

I cut shop class to rehearse!



Richie:

And that`s Chachi. We have a singing group, The Dialtones!

I think I heard my name.



Teens:

Fonzie:

Ayy`



(Teens talk at once to talk to Fonzie)



Fonzie:

Hold that thought. Anybody in my office, red`



Richie:

No, Fonzie. The men`s room is empty.



Fonzie:

Good. There`s a phone number on the wall I`ve been meaning to try.



Richie:

Every story`s got to have hero

Nothing more important to the plot

Well he`s got to have courage and he`s got to be strong



Girls:

The one word description is hot! Hot!

Hot! Hot! Hot! Hot!



Fonzie:

Friday night and all is right for teens and dreamers

Monkey stars and spudnik up above



All:

Ah



Fonzie:

Me and Elvis putting up with fans and screamers

Friday night`s the night they fall in love

All:

All:

They`re raised on white bread and apple pie



All:

Fonzie:

They`re not all champions, but they always try



All:

Wah, wah-ooh



Fonzie:

But they come to me for answers



All:

Wah, wah-ooh



Fonzie:

And they treasure each thing I say



All:

Wah, wah-ooh



Fonzie:

And they treat me like a hero



All:

Wah-ooh
