Message in the Music


Maybe you'll find a message in the music

The drummer could be speaking to your soul

When you tune into the groove

And let your body move

You're playing with the power of Rock and Roll



There's harmonies that can pick you up and hold you

A rhythm that has gospel at it's core

When the feeling gets so strong

That the singer and his song

Get you out of your seat and spin you 'cross the floor



It's cause music is the language of romance

And lovers dont need words when they can dance



Music is the language of romance

And lovers dont need words when they can dance



Baby

Baby you've found

Bay you found a message

Baby you've found a message in the music!

Baby you've found a message in the music!



Baby you've found a message in the music!
