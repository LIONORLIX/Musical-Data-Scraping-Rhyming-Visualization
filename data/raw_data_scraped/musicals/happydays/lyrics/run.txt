Run


Sometimes just a little bit scared can be a good thing

Sometimes just a little bit scared brings out your best

When you need to bite the bullet

Or to walk right through some pain

Try thinking like a hero

And then acting like John Wayne



John Wayne



Get on with it, pilgrim

Do the deed that must be done



Of course the other option is to

Run, run, run, run, run, run



Run like the wind

Fly like a kite

Disappear like drumsticks do

At dinner on a sunday night



Maybe it's time to face the music

Maybe you're the only one

You can rise to the occasion

Or you can

Run, run, run, run, run, run



Sometimes a little bit scared

Improves your chances



Sometimes just a little bit scared

Becomes a plus



Even though your knees are knocking

You're an asset to the team



When you manage not to just pass out

And resist the urge to scream



You're headed for the wheaties box

You're a champion...number one

But to fight another day sometimes we

Run, run, run, run, run



We may run a fever

We may run a light

And we may run for office some day

But we will never run from a fight



Are we Wisconsin Warriors

Are we Milwaukee Mice

We'll stand our ground and get the job done



We will never

Run, run, run,

Run, run, run,

Run, run, run,

Run, run, run,



We may run a fever

We may run a light

And we may run for office some day

But we will never run from a fight



We're scared to death but while we've got breath

We will never

Run, run, run, run, run



We will never ever run!
