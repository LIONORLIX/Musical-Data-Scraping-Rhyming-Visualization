Legend in Leather


Don?t you find it amazing

What a couple of years can do

To the town that you were born in,

and the people that you knew

It aught to be the way I remember

but it?s not that way at all

Oh, the blocks are so much shorter

and the houses seem so small



But there?s a ghost that lives

On memory lane

A handsome jack in the box

And when he pops up

It can drive a girl insane

And he took hold of me

With that first kiss

We were perfect together,

My legend in leather

Impossible not to miss

And I miss him still

And I always will



Every sunset reminds me

That there?s something I need to do

Make it through the night without him

Is getting easier it?s true

But every now and then there?s a whisper

Of a too familiar voice

Have you put us all behind you

Have you made your final choice



But there?s a ghost that lives

On memory lane

A handsome jack in the box

And when he pops up

It can drive a girl insane

And he took hold of me

With that first kiss

We were perfect together,

My legend in leather

Impossible not to miss

And I miss him still

And I always will

I miss him still

And I always will
