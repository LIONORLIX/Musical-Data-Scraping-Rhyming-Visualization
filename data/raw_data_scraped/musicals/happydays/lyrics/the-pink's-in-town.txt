The Pink's in Town


I come racin' into town

Settin' hearts on fire

I ride a big pink Harley

That I call 'Desire'

Heads start turnin'

When the Pink

Shows up

Wait!

This one's mine if

He ever grows up



Travelin' the country

Stretchin' their imaginations

Got a reputation

(Yeah, Yeah)

Yeah the word gets around

(Yeah the word gets around)

Got a thirst for adventure

Drinkin' up the sweet sensations

Breakin' taboos

(Yeah)

Knockin' down walls

(Yeah)

Fillin' up arenas

Fillin' them halls

(Fillin' up them halls)



Yeah the word gets around

Yeah the word gets around

Time to get the party started

You know The Pink Is In Town

(You know The Pink Is In Town)



(Dance Break)



Yeah the word gets around

Yeah the word gets around

Time to get the party started

You know The Pink Is In Town

(You know The Pink Is In Town)



Yeah the word gets around

Yeah the word gets around

Time to get the party started

You know The Pink Is In Town

(You know The Pink Is In Town)

Yeah!

Yeah!

Yeah!
