Fonzie:

I walk by a mirror

It sings out to me

Says, 'Hello boy, you're gazing at perfection'

Looking like a hero

Every hair in place

I'm built for speed and passionate inspection



I was a child of the streets

The school of hard knocks

Was my only school

Tough slice of life on my plate

But I'm master of my fate

I got a black belt in cool



You just snap your fingers

And the sun breaks through the gray clouds

You snap your fingers and the music starts to play

Crowds gather all around me

Center stage where I belong



Carhop Girls:

If love's a dance, then Fonzie is our song!

Singing,



(Simultaneous)

Carhop Girls:

Ayyyyy

Ay-yi-yiiiii

Ay-yi-yi-yi-yiiii

Ay-yi-yiiiii



Fonzie:

When there's trouble all around me

And there's problems to be solved

Without me the world would wonder

Which direction it revolved



Carhop Girls:

And he does it with a SNAP!



Fonzie:

Never could explain it

I've always had this gift

Broken engines start to purr beneath my fingers



Carhop Girls:

When it comes to purring,

Fonzie has the touch

And his killer kisses cast a spell that lingers



Fonzie:

I walk alone, it's by choice

Ain't no lonely in my voice

So don't spring that tender trap

Christmas alone, I do fine

I don't need no valentine

Solitary is a snap!



Fonzie/Carhop Girls:

I/you just snap my/your fingers

And the bad guys bite the dust

Snap my/your fingers

And the ladies start to lust



Fonzie:

The pleasure's unimagined



Carhop Girls:

The chemistry is strong

If love's a dance, then Fonzie is our song!

Singing,



(Simultaneous)

Carhop Girls:

Ayyyyy

Ay-yi-yiiiii

Ay-yi-yi-yi-yiiii

Ay-yi-yiiiii



Fonzie:

I'm the guy that kids can turn to

I'm Wisconsin's answer man

When the situation's hopeless

I'm the wizard with a plan



Carhop Girls:

And he does it with a SNAP!



(Simultaneous)

Carhop Girls:

He does it with an 'Aaay!'

He does it with a 'Whoa!'

He does it with a SNAP!



Fonzie:

Aaay!

Whoa!



Carhop Girls:

(Round)

Yeah, he does it with a SNAP!

Yeah, he does it with a SNAP!

Yeah, he does it with a...
