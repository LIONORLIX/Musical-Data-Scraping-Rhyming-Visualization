What I Dreamed Last Night (reprise)


Pinky:

Look at this place, what a fabulous home

She doesn't know what she's got

This kitchen's too sexy

Formica and chrome

And linoleum just gets me hot

There's a strange little yearning

A twinge that I get

When I think about breakfast

At my own dinette set

My dreams are simple

They'd never guess

I dream about wet hands, an apron

And a gingham dress

I've treasured independence all these years

So it makes no sense

To dream about two motorbikes and

Lots of trikes behind a picket fence



Pinky, Marion, Joanie (3 part):

Wonderful feeling

Like something inside me just woke up

It was a powerful feeling

Of changing the world

If I just spoke up



Joanie:

I can ask him to go steady



Marion:

It's time to set things right



Pinky:

I want a home of my own

Yes, I want what I dreamed

What I dreamed last night



Pinky, Marion, Joanie:

I want what I want and

I want it now

Forget what traditions of the past allow

I want what I want and

I'm willing to fight

'Cause I want what I want



Pinky:

Want what I dreamed



Marion & Joanie:

I want what I felt



Pinky:

Yes I want what I dreamed



Pinky, Marion, Joanie:

Last night
