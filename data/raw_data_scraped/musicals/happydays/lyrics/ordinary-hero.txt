Ordinary Hero


FONZIE:

Some lights flash like lightnin'

Some lights burn like coal

When it's freezing cold in the dead of winter

Tell me which one warms your soul

You need a big-hearted, hard-working, hardware man


ALL:

You need a big-hearted, hard-working, hardware man


FONZIE:

The measure of a man is more than a pencil mark on a kitchen door

A hero's a guy that gives all that he's got and then gives just a little bit more

He's up in the morning, off to the job, for eight hours 'a blue-collar fun

RICHIE, MARION, JOANIE:

Well there's mouths to be fed, and there's bills to be paid, so he does what has got to be done


FONZIE:

You gotta give it to Howard


ALL:

Howard


FONZIE:

This one's for you


ALL:

We've come to sing your praises, it's a song long overdue

Call it rock and roll recognition, that we know you've never had


THE LEOPARDS:

You're the ordinary hero!

RICHIE AND JOANIE:

And a hall of fame dad!


ALL:

You gotta give it to Howard

Howard!


FONZIE:

Well dads are all human, but yours is the greatest, there's nothing that he wouldn't do

A guy's just a guy, but he fights the good fight, get's it all done just for you


ALL:

He does it all for you


FONZIE:

All over the world there's guys like Howard and they  deserve your thanks

They ain't made outta money but always come up with the two bucks to fill up your tank


ALL:

You gotta give it to Howard

Howard!

This one's for you


HOWARD:

Some vocal recognition that it long, long overdue

ALL: For above and beyond the call of duty,

It's a well-known fact!

It's the ordinary hero!

It's the ordinary hero!

It's the ordinary hero that deserves a plaque on the wall, says to one,

says to all if you know this man your life if certainly blessed

A heart that is open

This man who is hopin'

You'll read the inscription and agree that he did his best

(Music Break)


ALL: 

Ba dum, Ba dum, Ba da da da dum, Ba dum, Ba dum, Ba da da dum,

Ba da da da dum, da da da dum da da, Ba dum dum dum dum da da dum dum,

dum dum da dum dum da da, Ba da da

ALL:

(Music break)


ALL: 

Ooooooohhhhhhhhhaaaaahhhhhhh

(Music break)

(Plunger sounds)


ALL: 

Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh Aah

Ba ba ba ba, ba ba ba ba ba ba ba bum

Let's give it to Howard!

Let's give it to Howard! (echo: Let's give it to Howard!)

Let's give it to Howard! (echo: Let's give it  to Howard!)
