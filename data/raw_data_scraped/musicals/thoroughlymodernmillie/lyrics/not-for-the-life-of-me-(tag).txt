Not for the Life of Me (Tag)


MILLIE:

They said I would sing the homesick blues



Granny dear, Mother mine

Old and gray at twenty-nine

Calloused hands, broken heart

Dreams that die before you start



I ain't got nothing, so I ain't got nothing to lose!

Who needs a hat? Who needs a purse?

And who needs you, mister whoever-you-are,

'cause I'm a pioneer woman, pal!

The Woolworth building! The Met Life Tower!

There's gold in them there hills, and I'm gonna get it or die trying!



Days of yore, kind and gentle

As me if I'm sentimental!

Not for the life of me

Boh-doh-dee-oh

Not for the life of

Not for the life of

Not for the life of me!



(Meanwhile, in the lobby of the Hotel Priscilla)



GLORIA, ALICE, RITA, RUTH, CORA and LUCILLE:

Burn the bridge, bet the store

Baby's coming home no more

Not for the life of me



A life that's gotta be more than a one-light town

Where the light is always red

Gotta be more than an old ghost town

Where the ghost ain't even dead



Clap your hands, just because

Where I am ain't where I was

Not for the life of

Me, Me, Me, Me, Me

Boh-doh-dee-oh

Not for the life of

Not for the life of me!
