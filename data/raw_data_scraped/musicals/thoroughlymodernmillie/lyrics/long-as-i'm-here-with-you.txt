Long as I'm Here with You


Muzzy's Boys:

We've been sad and lonsome here at Cafe Society but tonight the world is right.

A dream come true,

Miss "You know who" is back where she belongs.



Muzzy:

Life is a holiday. I'm talking June through May.

A nightly sell out show, and baby I'm front row.

Bye-Bye to lonely nights.

Only nights when the two of us can coo.

Skies are sunny and clear, Long as I'm here with you.



The world's a sugar bowl. It sevens ev'ry roll.

Sneak peek at paradise; the view is mighty nice.

I got no blues to sing; choose to sing a melody for two.

Happy ending is near, long as I'm here with you.

Happy ending is near, long as I'm here with you.

Who care if there's no booze, or that the Yankees loose?

Can't pay my income tax, but in spite of the facts,

No one ask for more,kid in a candy store!

The jackpot has been hit;

I'm living proof of it. And as for all that passed,

Call that past! I found a heart that's true.

What a red letter year, long as I'm here with you

And you, and you, and you, and you, and you and yeah you too.

So happy dear, long as I'm here with, long as I'm here with you!
