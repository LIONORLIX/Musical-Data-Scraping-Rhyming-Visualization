Ah! Sweet Mystery of Life


MR. GRAYDON:

Ah! Sweet mystery of life

At last I've found thee

Ah! I know at last the secret of it all!



MISS DOROTHY:

All the longing, seeking, striving, waiting, yearning

The burning hopes, the joy and idle tears that fall



MR. GRAYDON:

I've a very strange feeling I never felt before

'Tis a kind of a grind of depression



MISS DOROTHY:

My heart's acting strangely; it feels rather sore

At least it gives me that impression



MR. GRAYDON:

My pulses leap madly without any cause

Believe me, I'm telling you truly



MISS DOROTHY:

I'm gay without pause

Then sad without cause



MR. GRAYDON:

My spirits are truly unruly

For I'm falling in love with someone

Some one girl

I'm falling in love with someone

Head awhirl!



BOTH:

Yes, I'm falling in love with someone

Plain to see



MR. GRAYDON:

I'm sure I could love someone madly

If someone would only love me



(They dance an impassioned if acrobatic pas de deux.)



BOTH:

Yes, I'm falling in love with someone

Plain to see

I'm sure I could love someone madly

If someone would only love me
