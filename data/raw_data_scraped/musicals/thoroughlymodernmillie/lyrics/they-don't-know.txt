They Don't Know


MRS. MEERS:

They don't know my flair for the dramatic

Not a clue, the talent I possess

Pretty girls, but not much in the attic

Face-to-face with genius, and they never guess



They don't know they're staring at an artist

Highly trained to take on any role

Skillful mime, and brilliant laundry cart-ist

Seeking retribution for the life they stole



I almost acted Chekhov, Ibsen, Shaw, Moliere

I almost starred as Peter Pan; imagine moi midair!

I almost tackled Shakespeare, a blushing Juliet

And if the house were big enough I still could play her yet!



They don't know I'm hotter news than Duse

Helen Hayes and Bernhardt all in one

They're on top, and I look like the loser

Wait and see who's standing when my play is done



So welcome all ye bright young ladies

You're checking into Hotel Hades

I won't stand by while critics praise ya

You're getting shipped to Southeast Asia

But they don't know, they don't know

Sad to be all alone in the world

But they don't know
