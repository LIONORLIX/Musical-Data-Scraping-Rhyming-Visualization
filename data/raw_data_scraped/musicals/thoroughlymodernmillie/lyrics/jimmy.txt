Jimmy


MILLIE:

Am I drunk? Or maybe I'm dreaming

I oughta be screaming! He suddenly -



Everything today is thoroughly -



Just like that, without any warning

At two in the morning, he suddenly -



Everything today is thoroughly -



Were there signs, and I didn't see them?

A random remark, occasional sigh

That day in the park, the gleam in his eye



Everything today is thoroughly -

Everything today is thoroughly -



Jimmy, oh Jimmy, silly boy

Gee, what a real swell guy

Jimmy, oh Jimmy, oh what joy

He makes my troubles fly

His glance had fireworks in it

We kissed, my heart did a

Whiz-bang, flip-flop

Heaven for a minute



Jimmy, oh Jimmy, don't you know

What I can't quite confess?

So coax me, implore me

I promise you won't bore me

Jimmy I might say yes



He makes my troubles fly

His glance had fireworks in it

We kissed, my heart did a

Whiz-bang, flip-flop

Heaven for a minute



Jimmy, oh Jimmy, don't you know

What I can't quite confess?

So coax me, implore me

I promise you won't bore me

Oh, Jimmy, I might say yes
