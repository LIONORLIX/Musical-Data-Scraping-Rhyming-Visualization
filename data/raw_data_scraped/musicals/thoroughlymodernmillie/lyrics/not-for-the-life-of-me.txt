Not for the Life of Me


MILLIE:

I studied all the pictures in magazines and books

I memorized the subway map too

It's one block north to Macy's and two to Brothers Brooks

Manhattan, I prepared for you



You certainly are diff'rent from what they have back home

Where nothing's over three stories high

And no one's in a hurry or wants to roam

But I do, and they wonder why



They said I would soon be good and lonely

They said I would sing the homesick blues

(taking a train ticket from her pocket)

So I always have this ticket in my pocket

A ticket home in my pocket

To do with as I choose



(tearing the ticket in two)

Burn the bridge, bet the store

Baby's coming home no more

Not for the life of me

Break the lock, post my bail

Done my time, I'm out of jail

Not for the life of me



A life that's gotta be more than a one-light town

Where the light is always red

Gotta be more than an old ghost town

Where the ghost ain't even dead



Clap-a-your hands, just-a-because

Don't you know that where I am ain't where I was

Not for the life of me

Boh-doh-dee-oh

Not for the life of

Not for the life of

Not for the life of me!
