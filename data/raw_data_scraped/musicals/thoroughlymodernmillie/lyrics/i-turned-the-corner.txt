I Turned the Corner


JIMMY:

Thousands of people

Way down below

Wandering to and fro

Tireless people

No time to lose

Crowding the avenues and parks

On their marks

Racing fast; quite a cast

Millions of people, pick any two

They could be just like

You and me used to be

Way back when, strangers, then -



I turned the corner

And there you stood

Your smile like home to me

Your heart familiar

No use pretending, not that I could

I turned the corner when I met you



I turned the corner

Stopped on a dime

Like I remembered someone

Long forgotten

No mere flirtation, no marking time

I turned the corner when I met you

When I met you



Was our encounter planned

Destiny's guiding hand?

Fortune or fate, it's grand

The way you make me feel



JIMMY and MILLIE:

All of the past erased

Glorious future faced

Now that my life you've graced

I'll never be the same

I turned the corner

Feet on the ground

My spirit soared as you appeared before me!

I wasn't looking, look what I found



JIMMY:

I turned the corner when I met you



MILLIE:

I turned the corner

For I'm falling in love with someone, someone

I'm falling in love with someone

Head awhirl

Yes, I'm falling in love with someone

Plain to see

I'm sure I could love someone madly ...



JIMMY (at the same time):

I turned the corner when I met you

For I am falling in love with some one girl

I am falling in love

A feeling I have never felt

Pulse is leaping madly

Yes, I'm falling in love with someone

Plain to see

I'm sure I could love someone ...



MR. GRAYDON (at the same time):

Falling in love with someone

Some girl

A feeling I have never felt

Pulse is leaping madly

Yes, I'm falling in love with someone

Plain to see

I'm sure ...



MISS DOROTHY (at the same time):

Someone

Some one girl

Head awhirl

Yes, I'm falling in love with someone

Plain to see

I'm sure I could love someone ...



CHING HO:

I love you, Miss Dorothy



MILLIE, JIMMY, MR. GRAYDON and MISS DOROTHY:

If someone would only love me!
