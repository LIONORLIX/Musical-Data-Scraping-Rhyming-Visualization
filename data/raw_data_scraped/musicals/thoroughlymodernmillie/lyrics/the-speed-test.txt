The Speed Test


MR. GRAYDON:

Take a letter. To a Mr. John Hudson, Hudson's Floor Wax.

You will find an invoice in the file for the address. "Dear Mr. Hudson," colon:



My eyes are fully open to my awful situation

So I'm writing you a letter to demand an explanation

When the floor wax that we bought from you

Arrived here Monday morning

We discovered upon usage that the fume

Should have a warning

Since the only possibility is that the wax is rancid

I request a full refund of all the money we advanced

And unless you can convince me

You've improved the floor wax batter

We will take our business elsewhere

So I hope you solve this matter



How's my speed, Miss Dillmount?



MILLIE:

A little slow, perhaps.



MR. GRAYDON:

Ah!

Enclosed you'll find a small container

Of the stuff I talk about

Just carefully remove the lid

And take a whiff if you've a doubt

I'm sure you wouldn't want me

To alert the daily papers

With the news of how our office

Was affected by your vapours

Which is why I choose to write to you

A confidential letter

Full of strong recommendation

That you make your floor wax better

I just hope it won't require us

To have our floor relaid and

If it does you may expect a bill

Sincerely, Trevor Graydon



Now, read that back to me please.



MILLIE:

Certainly. "Dear Mr. Hudson," colon:

Nice!

MR. GRAYDON:

Not half bad. Continue please.

MR. GRAYDON:

Miss Dillmount, may I speak frankly?



MILLIE:

Yes?



MR. GRAYDON:

If I could be so lucky

As to have a good stenographer

To keep this place as up-to-date

As her short skirt and bobbed coiffure

I wouldn't have to worry 'bout

Our soured office planking

And could concentrate on generating

Profits ripe for banking

That is why I'm testing you

With this outrageous correspondence

Which I don't intend to actually mail

To the respondents

So if you can make sense of my unintelligble patter

Then the job is yours and Hudson's Floor Wax doesn't matter



MILLIE:

Hudson's Floor Wax doesn't matter?

Matter, matter, matter, matter

Hudson's Floor Wax doesn't matter?

Matter, matter, matter, matter



MR. GRAYDON (at the same time):

Hudson's Floor Wax doesn't matter!

Matter, matter, matter, matter

Hudson's Floor Wax doesn't matter!





OFFICE WORKERS (at the same time):

Hudson's Floor Wax doesn't matter!

Matter, matter, matter, matter



MR. GRAYDON:

Now, I want that letter on my desk in two minutes flat. Man your machine! Go!



(Millie's rapid fire typing/tapping dazzles the office workers. She presents the finished letter to Mr. Graydon.)



Time! "Dear Mr. Hudson,"



MILLIE AND OFFICE WORKERS:

Colon.

You have made the team Miss Dillmount!



OFFICE WORKERS:

MILLIE:

Tell me where my desk is

When we eat lunch

How much I'll be paid, and

Nice to meet you, I know we'll be friends

Just call me Millie Graydon



MR. GRAYDON and OFFICE WORKERS:

Millie Graydon?



MILLIE:

I mean Dillmount!



MR. GRAYDON and OFFICE WORKERS:

Millie Dillmount?



MILLIE:

Someday Graydon!



MR. GRAYDON and OFFICE WORKERS:

Graydon? Dillmount? Dillmount?

Graydon? Graydon? Dillmount?



MILLIE:

Graydon!



ALL:
