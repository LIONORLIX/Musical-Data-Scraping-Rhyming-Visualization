You Rule My World


Dave

Look at you, you're lying there

I feel your milky skin, caress your silky hair

For all these years you've been with me

I tilt my chin and what I see is



Only you...

Not feet or knees

You grumble and I stumble

Towards the Meunster cheese

I'm in your spell, a chubby fool

And anyone can tell

You rule my world - my world -

No matter what I do

You rule my world



Harold

Look at you - my life, my dream -

My lady with the eighty-dollar

Slumber cream

The hundred-dollar haircuts

The novelty appliances we never use



And all those shoes

You bought for when we go on

The Alaskan cruise

My boat is sinking, I don't care

You're everything I want

You rule my world - my world -

You're everything I need



Dave

Anywhere you go I'll follow



Harold

Anywhere I'll follow you



Dave

Anything you want I'll give you



Harold

Anything at all



Harold & Dave

Anything you feel hollow, don't worry



Harold

I'll make you whole.

Look at me



And hold me hard



A moment please, before they seize the Visa card



'Cause I'd do anything to keep you



You rule my world Dave

I'll swallow it whole



Just take a look at me



You never leave my side



Why can't I let you go?



Why can't I just lose -

You rule my world



Harold & Dave

My world



Dave

Though I'm unemployed



Harold

A tad depressed



Dave

I'm overweight



Harold

I'm overdressed



Harold & Dave

There's nothing I can do, you rule my world



Dave

There's nothing I can do...
