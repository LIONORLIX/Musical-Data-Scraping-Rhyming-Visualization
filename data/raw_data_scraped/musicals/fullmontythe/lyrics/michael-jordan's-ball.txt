Michael Jordan's Ball


Jerry

When Michael's got the basketball

It's Michael's house from wall to wall

You hear that name, it's a diff'rent game

When it's Michael Jordan's ball



When it's Michael's ball you're dead, you're through

'Cause Michael takes the game to you

He's in your face, you lost the race

It's Michael Jordan's ball



The fake, the spin

The drive and then he's in the paint

The pump, the jump, and he's up in the air

Like a goddamn saint!



When Micheal bolts and he penetrates

You feel the volts he generates

He's slick as soap, he's King, he's Pope

He's Michael Friggin' Jordan!



Jerry & Men

You fake, you spin, you drive

And then you're in the paint

You pump, you jump, and you're up there!



And you're through the roof

And you're in the zone

Two-hundred-proof testosterone

You're bad, you're hot, you're almost God!



Jerry

You're Michael Jordan...
