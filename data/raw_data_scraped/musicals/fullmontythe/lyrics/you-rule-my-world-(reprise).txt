You Rule My World (Reprise)


Georgie

I look at you and what I see

The only man I ever loved in front of me

I chose you, Dave, it hasn't changed

You're everything I want, you rule my world



Vicki

Look at you, you're standing there

You're still a prince

You're still the answer to a prayer

And what I see is all I want

You're everything -



Georgie

You're everything



Vicki

Anywhere you go, I'll be there



Georgie

Anywhere I'll follow you



Vicki

Anything you want, I'll give you



Georgie

Anything at all



Vicki

Anytime you're lost



Both

That's me there, I'm with you



Vicki

I'll see you back home Georgie

I'll take you home



Georgie

Look at me -



Vicki

Look at me, Harold



Georgie

And hold me tight



Vicki

Honey, don't you understand?



Georgie

You're like the morning sun to me

But twice as bright



Vicki

I'll never let you go



Georgie

And what I see is what I get



Both

And it's everything I want

You rule my world

You rule my world



Georgie

You're everything I need
