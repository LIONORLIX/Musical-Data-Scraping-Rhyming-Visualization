Breeze off the River


Jerry

There's a breeze off the river

Through the crack in the window pane

There's my boy on the pillow

And I feel like I'm lost again



Everybody knows the secret

They all know what their life should be

And they move like a river

Everybody knows except for me



And I never feel like somebody somebody

Calls a father

I can't explain

But when I look at you kid, it's like a mirror

It spins my head, it wakes me



Like the breeze off the river

Every time I see your face

And it's strange but familiar

Like a map of a better place



And sometimes I feel like I live in a shadow

And shadow's all I see

Then you jump straight up

And you grab the moon

And you make it shine on me

Where do you get it from?



Everybody knows the secret

Well I don't and I never did

I don't know any secret

All I know is I love you kid

All I know is I love you kid

All I know...
