Life With Harold


Vicki

You gotta love that man

He's like my personal angel

I've always wanted the kind of life

That I've been having as Harold's wife

What a catch I have caught

He would buy me the moon

If the moon could be bought

I'm telling you -

You gotta love that man



Jerry

Why can't you just tell her?



Harold

She adores me. How do you break the heart of someone you love?



Vicki

I really love that man

He likes me dressed to the nines

I saw two words and then ta-da

There's me completely in Prada

And I've got the boots that go with the belt

That goes with the bag

That goes with my wonderful life with Harold

You gotta love that man



So he tells me you boys are rollers at the mill.

That's wonderful. Of course,

I don't actually know what rollers do, but hey,

I hardly know what Harold does over there. It's all steel to me.



Harold

Look at her. She's a piece of Dresden china.

She'd break into a million pieces!



Vicki

God, I love that man

But lately he's working too hard

I keep on telling him how we

Should take a few weeks in Maui

And we'll feel the breeze and sample the poi

And go see Don Ho and I'll say

"Oh boy, how I love you, Harold"

I hit the jackpot with Harry



He's a gem - he's a beaut

He looks cute in a suit and he loves me to boot

I'm telling you

You gotta love that man



Love that man

I love that man

I love that man!

Men

Love that man

You gotta love that man

You really gotta love

That man
