It's a Woman's World


Georgie

Who's got power?

Who's got juice?

Who's got the money?



Women

It's a woman's world



Georgie

Who feels freedom

To let loose

Tonight, honey, honey -



Women

It's a woman's world



Georgie

Back at home my libido is asleep

Nothing stirring up the batter

Now I know all I needed was a heap

O' dancing beefcake on a platter



Women

A silver platter!



Georgie

Let's get sweaty and

Let's get mean

Fire up the burner -



Women

It's a woman's world



Georgie

I'll be president



Susan

I'll be queen



Joanie

I'll be Tina Turner -



Women

It's a woman's world



Goergie

'Cause tonight



Women

Yeah tonight



All

It's a woman's world



Georgie

Work all day, I come home and he's all pissed

It's a wallow-in-the-mudfest

Now I know all I need to clear the system's

Just a raunchy little studfest



God bless their little G-strings!



All that music and all that beat

Who's feeling funny -



Women

It's a woman's world



Georgie

All those men moving

All that meat

Tonight, honey-honey -



Women

It's a woman's world



Susan

I like the chunky little butt

On that motorcycle cop

I wanna go up there and bite it



Georgie

You'll chip a tooth, honey!



Joanie

Or G.I. Joe with the military jock

I'd give a hundred bucks to see what's inside it



Susan

What's inside it?



Estelle

What's inside it?



All

Why do they hide it?



All that music and all that beat

Making me dizzy

It's a woman's world

All those men moving

all that meat



Georgie

Let's get busy!



All

It's a woman's world

Well it might be the men's room



Georgie

Yeah, but tonight -



All

It's a woman's world!
