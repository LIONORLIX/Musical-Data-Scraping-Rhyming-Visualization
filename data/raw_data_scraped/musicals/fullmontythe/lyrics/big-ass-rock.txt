Big-Ass Rock


Jerry

Let's find a rock

I mean a big-ass rock

Or maybe something like

A cinder block is better

I'll hoist it up

And drop it on your face, my buddy



And just before the lights go out

You'll see my smile and you'll know

You've got a friend

With a rock

Who cares

I mean a big-ass rock



Dave

Or rope

I got some quality rope

Made for a man who's devoid of hope

Like you are, my buddy

Michael -



Malcolm

Unh, that's Malcolm.



Dave

Malcolm. Right!



And I won't leave you swinging there

Twitching like a fish while you claw the air

I'll grab your feet

And pal o' mine

I'll pull real hard

And snap your spinal cord



Jerry

The world is cold whn you're alone and

They ignore you

But don't kill yourself



Jerry & Dave

We'll do it for you

You've got a friend



Dave

You know, I asked a guy once if he'd mind putting me in a barrel

and sending me over the falls.

You know what the son of a bitch said? "Drop dead, asshole."



Jerry

People are pricks. I asked this guy to take his air compressor

and drill me with a six-inch nail right through the eye...



Dave

What'd he say?



Jerry

"I'm low on nails."



Dave

People are selfish pricks.



Jerry

Another time, now get this,

I just lay down in front of a steam roller and asked the guy just to proceed,

you know, business as usual, and just squash me like a bug.



Dave

That's a good way to go, Jer, the ol' bug squash.

We could tie a plastic laundry bag over his head.



Jerry

Naw, that's such a wimp suicide.



Malcolm

I stuck my finger in a socket once. It hurt real bad...but it didn't kill me.



Jerry

Malcolm, stay out of this.



Malcolm

I've got a friend

Like Carole King

Or was it Carly Simon

Used to sing?

I always get those two confused

But anyway -



I turned around

And suddenly

I'm not alone

It ain't just me

I'm like a player on the team

I'm part of the gang...

A member of the club Jerry & Dave

Player on our team

Part of the gang

Welcome to the club



Dave

Oo ... let's get a club



Jerry

I like the big-ass rock



Dave

Naw, one good swing and

I'll clean his clock forever



Jerry

Let gravity do the work!



Dave

It's a man's way to die, Mikey.



Jerry

Malcolm!



Malcolm

I got friends



Oo...

I've got friends



Oo...



Dave & Jerry

Friends who will

Love you like a maniac

And lead you like a lamb

To the railroad track

And tie you down



Or tickle your wrist

With a single-edge razor

Or buy you a beer with

A Draino chaser

Or dump you in the

River with a rock



Malcolm

A big-ass rock



Jerry

Here's a nice one right over here



Dave

Can I give you a hand with that? It looks heavy.



Jerry

No Dave

It's ain't heavy...he's my friend



Dave

Come on, group hug.
