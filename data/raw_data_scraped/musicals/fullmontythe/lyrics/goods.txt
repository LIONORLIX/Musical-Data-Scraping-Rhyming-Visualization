Jerry

Take a look at this girl

That's everything I like

She got the face, she got the waist

She got the legs



Malcolm

Naw, her tits are too big



Jerry

What are you, crazy?

Bodacious funbags are a must!

They gotta be C or D or better

They gotta post a threat to the sweater - ow!



She got the goods!

That's an eight or nine at least

She got the goods



Horse

Let me see that

She has some irredeemable flaws. I give her a six.



Ah - now there's a ten!



Jerry

You call that a ten?



Horse

Based on the booty



Jerry

What do you mean? It's huge.



Horse

She got a butt like a battleship!

I don't need to look above the hip



She got that shelf kinda ass ... you could display your tchotchkes, your collectibles on there.



Baby got back. That's a fact

You could park a wide-track Pontiac in that crack

Now that's the goods

The bigger the cushion -



Jerry

She's got a sofa-bed back there!



Dave

Well we just better hope the women are more forgiving than we are.



Horse

What is that supposed to mean?

Nightmare Pam

Holy goddamn fucking shit...
