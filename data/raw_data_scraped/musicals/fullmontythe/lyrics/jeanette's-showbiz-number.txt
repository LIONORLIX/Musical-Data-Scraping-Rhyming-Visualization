Jeanette's Showbiz Number


Jeanette

This gig's an echo of that time with Buddy Greco

When we did the Desert Inn in '59

The dancing girls were clunky

The drummer was a junkie

But we pulled the act together

And we killed 'em every time



That having been said, frankly

I think that things are worse here

That guy and his head are gonna need

Some kind of nurse here

It's like a friggin' curse here

Things could be better -

So sue me, it's the truth

Things could be better 'round here



It's an attitude problem. Seen it a million times.



I was subbing with Stan Kenton

In this seedy club in Trenton

When I heard my third divorce

Had just gone through

I coulda torn my heart out

But instead I got my chart out

And I gave 'em all a lesson

In the way to play the blues



That having been said

Something is even more morose here

Just looking ahead's making me feel

Real gross here

We aren't even close here

Things could be better

Could they get any worse? I don't think so

Things could be better 'round here



It's like a putz museum

A showbiz mausoleum

Things could be better 'round here



Dave

There's a problem with the timing



Horse

There's a problem with the groove



Harold

There's an overwhelming lethargy

Nothing can improve



Jeanette

You can sense defeat get closer

Every time they add a move...



Men

There's only six days Ethan

Where am I? Don't worry, I'll get it. Who are you?



Jeanette

This guys needs a helmet

That guy needs some lipo

And I could use some Geritol delivered in a hypo

But I don't wanna gripe -



Men

Oh -

Things could be better



Jeanette

You bet your ass they could.



Things could be better 'round here



Now let me just tell you something...



I've played for hoofers who can't hoof

I've played for tone-deaf singers

And once, when I insulted Frank

I played with broken fingers



I've paid my dues

I know the blues -

Of this I can assure you

So now I'll say it one last time

'Cause I don't want to bore you

I've got some bad news for you



Jeanette

Things could be better



Men

Things could be better

They really could be better



Jeanette

Let's face it, we suck.



Men

We're deep down in the ditch, man



Jeanette

This showbiz is a bitch, man

Things could be better



Men

We could be better



Jeanette

Things could be better 'round -



You know what Kate Smith used to say about a bad rehearsal?

Usually means a bad performance.
