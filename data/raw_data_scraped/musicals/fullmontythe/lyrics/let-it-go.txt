Let It Go


Ethan

Did I capture your imagination?

Did I break you down and make you smile?

It's a serious little situation

Why don't we loosen up and dance a while?



Dave

You need a loose-lipped lover

With a heart of honey



Harold

You need a sex cadet when duty calls



Malcolm

Come on show me all your bare-faced beauty



Horse

I wanna see our shadows bouncing off the walls



Ethan, Malcolm, Dave, Horse & Harold

Let it go, let it go, loose up, yeah, let it go

Let it go, let it go, it's all right

Let it go, let it go, shake it up now, let it go

You just tell me when you think you're ready



Malcolm

Let the music be the master



Horse

I got a whammy bar on my brown guitar



Dave

You can play me like a stratocaster



Jerry

'Cause here I am and baby, there you are!



Jerry and Ethan

Well I'm a rocket boy with a touch like silver



Horse & Harold

And I'm crashing through your bedroom door



Jerry, Ethan, Malcolm

And I'm ready like I hope you're ready



Jerry

Come on I'll show you mine

If you show me yours



Men

Let it go, let it go, loose up, yeah, let it go

Let it go, let it go, it's all right

Let it go, let it go, shake it up now, let it go

You just tell me when you think you're ready



Let it go -



Jerry

Gentlemen - we only live once



Men

Let it go, let it go

Loosen up, yeah, let it go

Let it go, let it go

It's all right



Let it go, let it go

Shake it up now, let it go



Let it go!

Women

Let it go, let it go

Let it go



Let it go

Let it go, go
