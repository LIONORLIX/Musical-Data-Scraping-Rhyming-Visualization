You Walk With Me


Malcolm

Is is the wind

Over my shoulder?

Is it the wind that I hear gently whispering

Are you alone there in the valley?

No, not alone for you walk, you walk with me



Is it the wind there over my shoulder?

Is it your voice calling quietly?

Over the hilltop, down in the valley

Never alone for you walk with me



When evening falls

And the air gets colder

When shadows cover the road I am following

Will I be along there in the darkness?

No, not alone, not alone

And I'll never be...



Ethan

Never alone, you are walking

You're walking with me



Malcolm & Ethan

Is it the wind there, over my shoulder?

Is it your voice calling quietly?

Over the hilltop, down in the valley

Never alone for you walk with me

Over the hilltop, down in the valley

Never alone for you walk with me



Malcolm

Never alone for you walk with me
