Jerry

What I want? That's easy asshole -

I want a job

I want to feel like a person instead of a slob

I wanna wake up knowing where I'm gonna go

Not going nowhere

Wandering the streets of Buffalo

'Cause it's a slow town

When you don't know where to go



I'll be wetting down the razor

Then I'll figure

"What's the point?"

So I go into the living room

Roll another joint. Then lunch. Then a beer

Then sitting like an ape on the sofa

With a hankie

And the same old porno tape



And that's a big day when you're scrap



Dave

What I want? I'll tell you jerky -

I want a life

I want to feel like the husband

Instead of the wife

I want to get some sleep when I go to bed

Instead of lying there digging through

The garbage in my head



Jerry & Dave

And it's a long night when you're scrap

It's a long, long nightwhen you're scrap



Malcolm

I know what I want.

A place of my own. It could be a room, even. Just so it's mine.



Ethan

I don't know what i want. Something. Somebody.



I guess I'm lonely



Malcolm

I'm lonely

I don't know what to do

I should get out -



Ethan

A bar -



Ethan & Malcolm

A party or two



Malcolm

I sure could use a friend



Ethan

Somebody -



Ethan & Malcolm

But there's that horrifying moment when

They ask you what you do



Malcolm

Hi. I'm Malcolm, a complete loser who still lives at home with his mother.



Dave

Hi. I'm Dave Bukatinsky.

I just defrosted my refrigerator and vacuumed my living room.

And how was your day?



Jerry

Hi, I'm Jerry Lukowski. I'm 32, out of work, divorced, in debt up to my balls.

I need some serious dental work and

if I don't make some money soon they won't let me see my kid.

I'm fed up, frustrated, angry and oh yeah -



Men



So what I want - that's easy

I want to understand

How I got to be a loser

And I used to be a man

And I don't know where I'm going

I don't know why I'm here

All I know is that the future

Will include another beer



And that's important -



I just want some veal

Or a steak on the table

'S that too much to ask?

I just want something real

Something right, something stable

'S that too much to ask?



I just want to feel like

I know what my label is

Just tell me what my label is



Just give me

Anything but... I'm happy to be

Anything but...

I don't wanna be...
