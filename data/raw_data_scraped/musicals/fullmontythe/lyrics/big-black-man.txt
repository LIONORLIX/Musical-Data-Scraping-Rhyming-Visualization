Big Black Man


Horse

When I was just a little nipper

Daddy told me "Son

That thing there underneath your zipper

Can be lots of fun

When you get a little older

You'll understand

That every woman in the world loves

A big black man."



Now I ain't elite, I ain't no man of means

But I got mean feet and my daddy's genes

You just meet me once and you'll understand

There ain't nothing in the world like

A big black man



Cause I'm big and I'm proud

Singing out loud

Dancing it since the day I was born

Who's got the tools?

Who breaks the rules?

'Git back

And let a man do the popcorn!



I'm what your sister and your mother's

Always thinking of

They put my picture on the cover

Of the book of love

Never need a line

I don't need no plan

'Cause there ain't nothin in the world like a -

Here I go,

Now hit me!

Hit me twice!

Hit me three times!



I do the monkey

The mashed potatoes

I do the jerk

Now watch me work!



You can look up and down

All over town

Ask anybody

Ask all around

Who knows the grooves?

Who busta' moves?

I got the...

And the...

And the...



Horse & Jerry

I'm/He's what your sister and your mama's

Always thinking of

I/You take up eight whole chapters

In the book of love

It's a long low load with a deep dark tan

There ain't nothing in the world

Like a big black man



Horse

Sing!



Horse and Jerry

A big black man



Horse, Jerry, Dave

A big black man



Horse, Jerry, Dave, Malcolm

A big black man



Harold

Gotta love a big black man!



All

A big black man!
