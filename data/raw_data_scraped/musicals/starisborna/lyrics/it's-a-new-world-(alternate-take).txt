It's A New World (Alternate Take)


How wonderful that I'm beholding

A never-never land unfolding

Where we polish up the stars

And mountains we move

In a life where all the pleasures

We will prove.

It's a new world, I see

A new world for me!

The tears have rolled off my cheek

And fears fade ev'rytime you speak

A new world though we're in a tiny room

What a vision of joy and blossom and bloom!

A new found promise

One that will last

So I'm holding on and I'm holding fast!

You've brought a new world to me

And that it'll always, always be.
