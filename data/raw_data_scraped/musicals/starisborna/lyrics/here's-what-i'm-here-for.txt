Here's What I'm Here For


What am I here for?

It's time you knew.

Here's what I'm here for:

I'm here for you.

Can you forgive me?

Am I too late?

All the years that I've wandered and pondered

Were squandered.



My heart insisted

I seek you out.

That you existed,

My heart had no doubt.

To share a journey that leads to heaven's door,

You'll find is what I'm here for.
