Debts


[1st VERSE:]

England and Italy and Germany and France

We came here to discuss the debts

And we're leaving with no regrets

For England and Italy and Germany and France

We have more than reached our aim

And we're mighty glad we came



[Europe's REFRAIN:]

We've had a lovely conference with the U.S.A.

We'll pay our debts in silver and we'll be glad to pay

In a month or two we think we can pay our debts in zinc

And the next year we'll begin paying off what's left in tin

Oh, how we love America for she never makes a fuss

That's why we love America and America loves us

We'll tell our countries what we did and they're bound to say

If you think we can pay them off in wood, go back to the U.S.A.



[2nd VERSE:]

England and Italy and Germany and France

Here's some news that you ought to know

Off the gold standard we must go

Like England and Italy and Germany and France

We are going to inflate

And we're very glad to state:



[America's REFRAIN:]

Let the pound go up, the franc go up, the mark go up as well

Uncle Sam will be in Heaven when the dollar goes to Hell



For the stocks go up, the bonds go up, when no one wants to sell

Uncle Sam will be in Heaven when the dollar goes to Hell



Of course, our friends won't like it across the ocean blue

But we can greet our neighbors with a hey nonny nonny and a nuts to you



Let them call us this and call us that but while they scream and yell

Uncle Sam will be in Heaven when the dollar goes to Hell
