Easter Parade


[VERSE:]

Never saw you look quite so pretty before

Never saw you dressed quite so lovely what's more

I could hardly wait to keep our date this lovely Easter morning

And my heart beat fast as I came through the door

For



[REFRAIN:]

In your Easter bonnet, with all the frills upon it

You'll be the grandest lady in the Easter parade



I'll be all in clover and when they look you over

I'll be the proudest fellow in the Easter parade



On the Avenue

Fifth Avenue

The photographers will snap us

And you'll find that you're

In the rotogravure



Oh, I could write a sonnet about your Easter bonnet

And of the girl I'm taking to the Easter parade



[alternate bridge for Great Britain:]

To the Park we'll go

Round Rotten Row

The photographers will snap us

And then you'll be seen

In the smart magazine
