Our Wedding Day


[BRIDESMAIDS & USHERS:]

Ten little bridesmaids, ten little ushers

Marching side by side

We gave our promises to come to Saint Thomas's

And usher for the bridegroom

And bridesmaid for the bride

From a hundred we were chosen and we're very glad we were

For this is the most important wedding on the social register

It's a perfect match

He was quite a catch

For the bridegroom is a member of the best of families

And the lovely bride

On her mother's side

Is a first or second cousin of the Astors, if you please

Cholly Knickerbocker says this is a smart affair

Cholly will be there

Knee-deep in Vanderbilts

It is plain to see, it is plain to see

Why we're proud to be, why we're proud to be

The selected few picked from Who's Who

To come here side by side

And usher for the bridegroom

And bridesmaid for the bride

Now we must go into church and see the groom and bride

Standing side by side

Knee-deep in Vanderbilts

For the happy pair, for the happy pair

Will be waiting there, will be waiting there

So we can't be late, we mustn't wait

The knot will soon be tied

Champagne for the bridegroom

And babies for the bride



[1st VERSE:]

[GROOM:]

Wake up, sleepyhead

Tumble out of bed

Wake up, don't be so slow

Bells go ting-a-ling

Let's be hurrying

Off to church we must go



[REFRAIN:]

Sun's in the sky, don't you know why?

This is our wedding day



Birds in their nest are singing their best

For we're going to be married



Flowers are in bloom and the perfume

Speaks of a bride's bouquet



Spread the good news with rice and old shoes

For this is our wedding day



[2nd VERSE:]

[BRIDE:]

I'm so sleepy, dear

Won't you make it clear

Why you're shaking me so

Please, dear, cut it out

What's it all about?



[GROOM:]

Off to church we must go
