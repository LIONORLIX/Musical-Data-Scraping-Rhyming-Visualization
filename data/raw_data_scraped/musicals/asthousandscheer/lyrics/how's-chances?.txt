How's Chances?


[1st VERSE:]

The nickels and dimes I got

Have bought me an awful lot

A great big box of bonds and stocks

A hundred frocks, a car and a yacht

But having so much and more

Is getting to be a bore

It's not much fun when day is done

Without someone to love and adore



[REFRAIN:]

How's chances, say, how are the chances

Of making you love me the way I love you



I'd give up the things I'm possessing

To be caressing someone like you



How's chances for one of those glances

A glimpse of the heaven I'm longing to see



How's chances to end all your romances

And start taking your chances with me



[2nd VERSE:]

My tailor's the best but he

Is dear as a man can be

My shoes and spats, my opera hats

And my cravats are made just for me

I like an expensive car

And when at my favorite bar

I think it's fine to order wine

And when I dine, I love caviar



[alternate VERSE, from sheet music:]

When I want to see the boys

I know where to find the boys

I don't go through a club or two

I just find you and there are the boys

To get you alone I strive

You ask me to tea at five

I find you then with other men

And wonder when my chance will arrive



[alternate bridge:]

My castle will need some restoring

Ceiling and flooring, furniture, too



[another alternate bridge:]

How many young men must I fight with

To be in right with, in right with you
