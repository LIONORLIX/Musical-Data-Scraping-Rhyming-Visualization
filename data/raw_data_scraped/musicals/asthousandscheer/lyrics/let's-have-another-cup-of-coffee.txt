Let's Have Another Cup Of Coffee


[Verse:]

Why worry when skies are gray

Why should we complain

Let's laugh at the cloudy day

Let's sing in the rain

Songwriters say the storm quickly passes

That's their philosophy

They see the world through rose-colored glasses

Why shouldn't we?



[Refrain:]

Just around the corner

There's a rainbow in the sky

So let's have another cup o' coffee

And let's have another piece o' pie!



Trouble's just a bubble

And the clouds will soon roll by

So let's have another cup o' coffee

And let's have another piece o' pie



Let a smile be your umbrella

For it's just an April show'r

Even John D. Rockefeller

Is looking for the silver lining



Mister Herbert Hoover

Says that now's the time to buy

So let's have another cup o' coffee

And let's have another piece o' pie!





[Alternate Lines:]

Things that really matter

Are the things that gold can't buy
