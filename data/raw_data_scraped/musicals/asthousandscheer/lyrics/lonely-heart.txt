Lonely Heart


Miss Lonely Heart, what will I do?

I am a lonely heart writing to you

Hoping that through your column you will drop me a line

Saying you know a lonely heart as lonely as mine



Miss Lonely Heart, hear my appeal

You seem to know the way lonely hearts feel

That's why I'm writing and I'm asking for a reply

That's why I'm hoping you know someone lonely as I



I'm so blue returning to my lonely room

Ev'ry night, for nothing's quite as lonely as a lonely room



Miss Lonely Heart, I'm by myself

Watching the clock that stands up on the shelf

Hoping to hear the news that you know somebody who

Watches a clock and whispers "I'm a lonely heart too"
