Harlem On My Mind


[VERSE:]

Em'ralds in my bracelets and diamonds in my rings

A Riviera chateau and a lot of other things

And I'm blue, so blue am I

Lots of ready money in seven diff'rent banks

I counted up this morning, it's about a million francs

And I'm blue, so blue, and I know why



[REFRAIN:]

I've got Harlem on my mind

I've a longing to be lowdown

And my "parlez-vous" will not ring true

With Harlem on my mind



I've been wined and I've been dined

But I'm heading for a showdown

'Cause I can't go on from night to dawn

With Harlem on my mind



I go to supper with a French Marquis

Each evening after the show

My lips begin to whisper "Mon Cheri"

But my heart keeps singing "Hi-de-ho"



I've become too darn refined

And at night I hate to go down

To the high-falutin' flat that Lady Mendel designed

With Harlem on my mind





[Transcript of Ethel Waters' version:]

[VERSE:]

Em'ralds in my bracelets, diamonds in my rings

A Riviera chateau and a lot of other things

And I'm blue, so blue am I

Lots of ready money in seven diff'rent banks

I counted up this morning, it was 'bout a million francs

And I'm blue, so blue, and I know why



[1st REFRAIN:]

I've got Harlem on my mind

And I'm longin' to be lowdown

And my "parlez-vous" will not ring true

With Harlem on my mind



I've been dined and I've been wined

But I'm headin' for a showdown

'Cause I can't go on from night to dawn

With Harlem on my mind



I go to supper with a French Marquis

Each evening after the show

My lips begin to whisper "Mon Cheri"

But my heart keeps singin' "Hi-de-ho"



I've become too damned refined

And at night I hate to go down

To that high-falutin' flat that Lady Mendel designed

With Harlem on my mind



[2nd REFRAIN:]

I've got Harlem on my mind

And I'm longing to be lowdown

And my "parlez-vous" will not ring true

With Harlem on my mind



I've been dined and I've been wined

But sure as your born I'm headin' for a showdown

'Cause I can't go on from night to dawn

With Harlem on my mind



And when I'm bathing in my marble tub

Each evening after the show

I get to thinkin' 'bout that Cotton Club

And my heart starts chirping "Hi-de-ho"



Help me!



I've been too damned refined

And at night I hate to go down

To that flat with fifty million Frenchmen taggin' behind

With Harlem on my mind
