Finale: Not For All The Rice In China


At last! At last!

Something new in the show at last

Something new, if you please

We won't pull the same old wheeze

We mean that we won't reprise

The chorus of one of the melodies

At last! At last!

Here's a show that'll end at last

Without a reprise and that's news

They looked up the Constitution and they couldn't find a word

That said we had to sing a song that you'd already heard

The finest legal minds have met and everyone agrees

That when we reach the finale we don't have to sing a reprise

At last! At last!

We've come to the end at last

It'll all be over soon

But we don't intend to croon

The composer's favorite tune

The one they sang beneath the moon

Now we'll explain a reprise

It's that certain song they sing all through the show

And the one they sing again before you go

But the judges met and everyone agrees

That we will have to end without a reprise

Yes, we will have to end without a reprise



In your Easter bonnet, with all the frills upon it

You'll be the grandest lady in the Easter parade



No, you can't do that

You can't do that

You can't sing again about your Easter hat



We're having a heat wave, a tropical heat wave

The temp'rature's rising, it isn't surprising

She certainly can can-can



No, you can't repeat

You can't repeat

You can't sing again about the can-can heat



I've got Harlem on my mind

And I'm longing to be lowdown



No, you can't do that

You can't do that

Because if you do we're gonna leave you flat



Never mind that introduction for we don't intend to sing

The chorus of "How's Chances?" as it wouldn't mean a thing

We'd like to sing a song that wasn't written for the score

A simple little chorus that they haven't heard before

A simple little chorus that you haven't heard before:



[REFRAIN:]

Not for all the rice in China

Not for all the grapes in France

Would I exchange the pleasure

That I get with every measure

When we dance



Not for all the kilts in Scotland

Not for all the bulls in Spain

Would I give up arriving

At your house although you're driving

Me insane



Not for all the onions in Bermuda

Or the cheeses that are made by the Swiss

Would I exchange that first kiss

That you gave me



Not for all the beans in Boston

Not for all the steaks in Moore's

Would I agree to part with

All the joy you filled my heart with

When you said, "I'm yours"
