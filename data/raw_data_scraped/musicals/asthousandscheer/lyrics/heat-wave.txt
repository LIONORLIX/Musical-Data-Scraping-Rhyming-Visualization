Heat Wave


[VERSE:]

A heat wave blew right into town last week

She came from the island of Martinique

The can-can she dances will make you fry

The can-can is really the reason why



[REFRAIN:]

We're having a heat wave, a tropical heat wave

The temp'rature's rising, it isn't surprising

She certainly can can-can



She started the heat wave by letting her seat wave

And in such a way that the customers say that

She certainly can can-can



Gee

Her anatomy

Made the mercury

Jump to ninety-three

Yes, sir!



We're having a heat wave, a tropical heat wave

The way that she moves that thermometer proves that

She certainly can can-can



[PATTER:]

It's so hot the weather man will tell you a record's been made

It's so hot a coat of tan will cover your face in the shade

It's so hot the coldest maiden feels just as warm as a bride

It's so hot a chicken laid an egg on the street and it fried



[alternate lines:]

She started the heat wave by letting her feet wave



It's so hot a hefty maiden lost twenty pounds from each side
