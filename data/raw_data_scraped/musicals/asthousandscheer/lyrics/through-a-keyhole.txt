Through A Keyhole


[VERSE:]

My mother was frightened by

A snoopy neighbor who poked his eye

Through mother's keyhole and that is why

I am what I am today

The man who looks through the keyholes along Broadway

My job is to be alert

And get the lowdown on all the dirt

The dirt that gathers on Broadway's skirt

For that's how I earn my pay

The man who looks through the keyholes along Broadway



[1st REFRAIN:]

Would you like to take a look through a keyhole?

If you'd like to get the in on the latest bit of sin, have a look



Life is like an open book through a keyhole

If you wonder what occurs 'ere the lady gets her furs, have a look



Angry people who think they're tough

Start to threaten but that's a bluff

They may holler but they won't stuff up their keyhole



So come on and have a look through a keyhole

If you'd like to get a view, view of who is cheating who, have a look



[2nd REFRAIN:]

So come on and have a look through a keyhole

If you want to see New York getting ready for the stork, have a look



Life is like an open book through a keyhole

If you want to get a load of the husband on the road, have a look



Lovely ladies of ev'ry kind

Think they're safe when they pull the blind

I see just what is on their mind through a keyhole



So come on and have a look through a keyhole

If you'd really like to know how she got into the show, have a look
