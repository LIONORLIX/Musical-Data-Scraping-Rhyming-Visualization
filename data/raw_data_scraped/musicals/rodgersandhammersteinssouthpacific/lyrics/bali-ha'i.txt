Bali Ha'i


Bloody Mary:

Most people live on a lonely island,

Lost in the middle of a foggy sea.

Most people long for another island,

One where they know they will like to be.



Bali Ha'i may call you,

Any night, any day,

In your heart, you'll hear it call you:

"Come away...Come away."



Bali Ha'i will whisper

In the wind of the sea:

"Here am I, your special island!

Come to me, come to me!"



Your own special hopes,

Your own special dreams,

Bloom on the hillside

And shine in the streams.

If you try, you'll find me

Where the sky meets the sea.

"Here am I your special island

Come to me, Come to me."



Bali Ha'i,

Bali Ha'i,

Bali Ha'i!



Someday you'll see me floatin' in the sunshine,

My head stickin' out from a loaf nighin' cloud,

You'll hear me call you,

Singin' through the sunshine,

Sweet and clear as can be:

"Come to me, here am I, come to me."

If you try, you'll find me

Where the sky meets the sea.

"Here am I your special island

Come to me, Come to me."



Bali Ha'i,

Bali Ha'i,

Bali Ha'i!
