Honey Bun


Nellie:

My doll is as dainty as a sparrow,

Her figure is somethin' to applaud.

Where she's narrow she's as narrow an arrow,

And she's broad where a broad should be broad.



A hundred and one pounds of fun,

That's my little honey bun!

Get a load of honey bun tonight.



I'm speakin' of my Sweetie Pie,

Only sixty inches high,

Ev'ry inch is packed with dynamite!



Her hair is blond and curly,

Her curls are hurly-burly.

Her lips are pips!

I call her hips 'Twirly' and 'Whirly.'



She's my baby, I'm her pap!

I'm her booby, she's my trap!

I am caught and I don't wanna run,

'Cause I'm havin' so much fun with honey bun!



I am caught and I don't wanna run,

'Cause I'm havin' so much fun with honey bun!



Believe me sonny!

She a cookie who can cook you 'till you're done,

Ain't bein' funny!

Sonny, put your money on my honey bun!
