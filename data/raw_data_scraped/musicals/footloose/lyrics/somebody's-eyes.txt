Somebody's Eyes


Rusty

Careful what you do

Someone's on to you

Careful what you do

Urleen

Careful what you say

Cuz you're on display

Every night and every day

Rusty

Somebody's hiding in the great unknown

Urleen & Wendy Jo

Unh-hunh

Rusty

And every time you think that you're alone

Somebody's eyes are watching

Urleen

Somebody's eyes are seeing you come and go

Wendy Jo

Somebody's out there, waiting for the show

Rusty, Wendy Jo & Urleen

You've got no disguise

From somebody's eyes

Rusty, Wendy Jo, Urleen & Chorus

Somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody's eyes

Whoa-oh

Somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody's eyes

Whoa-oh

Urleen

Careful how you speak

Turn the other cheek

Be careful how you speak

Wendy Jo

Think a naughty thought

And if you get caught

Well, then, boy, you've bought a lot of trouble

Rusty

Somewhere there's someone with a perfect view

Urleen & Wendy Jo

Yoo-hoo

Rusty

And they're just dyin' for a little peek-a-boo

Urleen & Wendy Jo

Boo!

Rusty, Urleen & Wendy Jo

Somebody's eyes are watching

Somebody's eyes will never close, never sleep

Somebody's after the secrets that you keep

Who's got alibis

From somebody's eyes?

Rusty, Wendy Jo, Urleen & Chorus

Somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody's eyes whoa-oh

Somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody's eyes whoa-oh

Urleen

Never laugh too loud

Never leave a crowd

Wendy Jo

Never dress risque

There'll be hell to pay

Rusty

If you've ever had anything to hide

Think twice before you step outside

Rusty, Urleen & Wendy Jo

Somebody's eyes are watching

Somebody's eyes are following every move

Somebody's waiting to show they don't approve

Urleen

Nothing satisfies

Urleen & Rusty

Somebody's eyes

Wendy Jo

Ain't no alibis

Wendy Jo & Urleen

In somebody's eyes

Rusty

You've got no disguise

Rusty, Urleen & Wendy Jo

From somebody's eyes

Chorus

Somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody's eyes

Rusty, Urleen, Wendy Jo & Chorus

Whoa-oh

Somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody's eyes

Rusty, Urleen & Wendy Jo

Whoa-oh

Whoa-oh
