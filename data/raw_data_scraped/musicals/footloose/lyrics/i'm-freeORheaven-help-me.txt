I'm Free/Heaven Help Me


Ren

Looking into your eyes I know I'm right

If there's anything worth the fear, it's worth the fight

No one can tie my hands

Or make me change my plans

I'm crossin' the line, jumpin' the track

Takin' what's mine and not lookin' back

Heaven helps the man who fights his fear

Every day I face a new frontier

I can't worry what the world will say

I may fly or fall but either way

I'm free

Running away will never set you free

Doesn't matter where you go, I guarantee

Long as we hold our ground

We cannot be bound

We're shakin' the past, makin' our breaks

Takin' control if that's what it takes

Heaven helps the man who fights his fear

We can face it down right now, righ there

Once you're standing on your own two feet

You will not retreat if you repeat

I'm free!

C'mon! Try it!

Kids

I'm free!

Ren

"Let the Lord hear your voice!"

Kids

I'm free

We're shakin' the past, makin' our breaks

Takin' control if that's what it takes

Ren

I'm free!

Kids

Heaven helps the man who fights his fear

We can face it down right now, right here

Maybe we can finally right this wrong

Arm in arm and side by side we're strong

And free!

Shaw

And now word comes to me that some young people in our

community want to change our law and throw a dance. This morning

let's remind ourselves that this law is not about dancing. This

law is a tribute - a tribute to four young people who held the

promise of Bomont's brightest future.

Kids

Heaven helps the man

Shaw

And we stand united in honoring their memory

Kids Shaw Choir

We can face it down Heaven help me You will see us

Right now Someone's got to Raising our voices

Right here save his neighbors All of our voices

Heaven help me

Making our breaks

Oh, heaven help me

For heaven's sake For heaven's sake

If heaven can't

We will be released

Heaven helps the man Who can?

Heaven helps the man

Heaven helps the man

I'm free!
