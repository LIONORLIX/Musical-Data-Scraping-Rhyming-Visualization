Let's Make Believe We're in Love


Irene

I don't know your name

And you don't know mine

That sounds like a fine place to start

We are strangers, it seems

With our own sep'rate dreams

But I feel like I know you by heart

Look at the moon slowly risin'

Look at those stars up above

Darlin', just for tonight

Until we get it right

Let's make believe we're in love

Imagine the bliss

That comes with one kiss

Imagine that feeling won't end

There'll be no tears at stake

And no heart's gonna break

Cuz it never hurts to pretend

Look at the moon slowly risin'

Look at those stars up above

Let's begin with hello

Then we'll see where things go

Let's make believe we're in love

It may not yet be true

But let's see what we can do

Let's make believe we're in love
