Heaven Help Me


Shaw

I don't enjoy being her jailor

I don't relish telling her "No!"

But then I think - what if I fail her?

How can I just let her go?

I strive to be a good preacher

I try not to go overboard

But then I think - if I can't reach her

How can I face my Lord?

Heaven help me shoulder my load

Every day's a struggle, still

Someone's got to take the high road

If I don't, who will?

I became a man of God

To do his work

To spread his word

To ease some pain

And dry some tears

That was the plan

But I might have thought twice if only I knew that

I'd spend all of my time saying, "Ainh ainh ainh, no no! Don't do that!"

See, everyone prays for salvation

I'm happy to give them the tools

The problem is - here's my frustration

Nobody wants to have rules

So heaven help me with my labors

How can you expect one man to

Save his family and his neighbors?

Heaven help me

Oh, heaven help me

If heaven can't, who can?
