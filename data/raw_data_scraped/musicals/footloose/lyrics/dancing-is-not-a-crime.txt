Dancing Is Not a Crime


Ren Garvin, Jeter, Bickle & Willard

Dancing is not a crime

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Ever since the dawn of time

If anything, everybody had

The right to howl at the moon

And to move all night Ah-ooo

Move all night



When folks were tribal -

Back before the bible -

They were liable to dance

When the crops came in

Or they'd pull out all the stops

When the earth would spin

Or maybe

What?

They had a battle to win

So they'd go thumpin' on a tree trunk (thump, thump, thump, thump)

Grooving to the free funk

Yeah!

And just like that

In nothin' flat

There'd be hands clappin'

Toes tappin', feet flappin'

Dogs yappin'

Hey! Hey!

I coulda told you that would happen

They would dance

They would dance

Every time they had the chance

Whatever the season

or circumstance

They found a reason to throw a

party in their pants

And they'd dance

Wow!

They would dance

Yeah, dance Yeah!

They would dance

Oh, dance Dance

They would dance

Yeah, dance Dance

They would dance

(gavel raps)

(Ren opens a Bible)

So if you've heard about

Adam and Abraham, you will

Remember this guy from the

Book of Sam-uel. David?

Y'know, Kind David?

Dave

He make a science outta

knockin' out giants

The bigger they come

The harder they fall

He didn't like math or

geography, but, check Check this out:

this out:

He loved choreography!

(Ren does a few steps)

Careful, Ren

There's a law

Now what were you saying

To Reverend Shaw?



Right here, in black and white

Says he was "leaping and dancing

with all of his might"

Leaping and dancing Leaping and dancing

in front of his Lord

But David wasn't doing it

for some reward

No, no, no, no

It might sound odd

But David thought it brought him

closer to God

So he would dance

Hal-le-lu

Every time he had the chance

Whatever the season Whatever the season

or circumstance or circumstance

He found a reason to throw

a party in his pants In his pants

And he'd dance

Par-tay!

He would dance

So dancing doesn't always

make you do nasties

Look at the Book of Ecclesiastes

Okay

There's a time to laugh

A time to weep

Boo-hoo

There's a time to plant

A time to reap

And there's a time And there's a time

to dance to dance

It says it right here right here

Right here

Man doth dance

And it was good



And if the Bible tells me so

Then what have I got to fear?

Got no fear

We only wanna kick our heels

And I betcha ev'ry one of you knows

how that feels



I betcha do

They do

Uh huh

I betcha do

They say they don't

But we know they do

People been dancing

since God knows when

And that's the way

it should be again

So let's dance Hal-le-lu

Ev'ry time we get the chance Let's dance

Whatever the season

or circumstance

Find a reason to throw Find a reason

that party in your pants

And then

Dance Dance

Amen Whatever the season

Dance dance dance dance Dance dance dance dance

Whatever the season Whatever the season

Or reason Or reason

It's pleasin' It's pleasin'

To dance To dance
