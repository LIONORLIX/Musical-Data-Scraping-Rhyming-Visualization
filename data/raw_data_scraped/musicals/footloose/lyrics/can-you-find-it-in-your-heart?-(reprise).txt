Can You Find It in Your Heart? (Reprise)


Shaw

I hope you never doubt that I love you

If that's hard to figure out sometimes, well, then, I apologize

But you are dearer to my life than you could ever realize

If I try to make amends

Can you teach me how to start?

Can you find it in your heart?
