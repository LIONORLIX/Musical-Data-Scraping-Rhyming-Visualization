They Couldn't Compare To You


MERCURY

Oh, what a bevvy of beauties!

Oh, what a school of fish!

Oh, what a covey of cuties!

Oh, what a dish delish.



I've known litters of minxes

All of them fun for a while

But now for the nonce what me thinks is

You've got 'em



GIRLS

We've got 'em



MERCURY AND GIRLS

Beat a mile.

They...



MERCURY

They couldn't compare to you

They couldn't compare to you

Althought I've played many, many a maid

They couldn't compare to you.

I've thoroughly pitched the woo

From the heights of Valhalla to Kalamazoo

And though they all had a lot on the ball,

They couldn't compare to you.



GIRLS

Of ladies fair,

He's had more than his share



MERCURY

And strange, but true

I hereby declare from tiptoe to hair

They couldn't compare to you.



After playing the local sirens

That resided in my environs

I decided to learn the art of Cupid's trickery.

So at once, I started crusing.

Found the muses so amusing

That I even got a kick out of Terpsichore

After her, I met Calypso

Who was definitely a dip-so

Then I fled to big Brunhilde

(She was German)

After snitching Eve from Adam,

I attended "Called Me Madam"

And shortly began to nestle "Essle" Merman.

I admired the silken body

Of the chic Schaharazade

Then of Lady Godiva, I became the lord.

After that, I staged an orgie

For some friends of Lucrezia Borgia

And ended up at the Stork with Fannie Ward

After having had a party

With Venetian goddess Astarte,

I raised a bit of hell with Penelope.

After quieting all my urges

For several vestial virgins

I put on a strip for Gypsy Rose Lee.

Though I liked the queen of Sheeba,

She was mentally an amoeba.

As for Beatrice d'Este

She was a pest

And far too chesty.

As for the passionate wife of Nero,

My reactions were, frankly, zero.

And as for that that sourceress known as Cerce

She was so hot I hollered for mercy



GIRLS

So hot he hollered for mercy



MERCURY

There was Gallatia, and mean Medea and Sappho, one of the best.

There was Nefertiti, a perfect sweetie

And gay Mae West.

I was a hell of a fella with Cinderella

And Isabella of Spain.

And I used to caress both Lola Montez and that damn Calamity Jane.

When betwixt Nell Gwyn and Anne Boelyn I was forced to make my choice

I became so confused I was even amused and abused by Peggy Joyce.

There was Melisande, a platinum blonde,

How I loved to ruffle her locks.

There was bright Aurora and then Pandora who let me open her...



GIRLS

They couldn't compare to you



MERCURY

They couldn't compare to you



GIRLS

Although he's played many, many a maid



MERCURY

They couldn't compare to you.

I've thoroughly pitched the woo

From the heights of Valhalla to Kalamazoo,



GIRLS

And though they all had a lot on the ball



MERCURY

They couldn't compare to you.



GIRLS

Of ladies fair

He's loved more than his share



MERCURY

And strange, but true

I hereby declare

From tiptoe to hair



GIRLS

From head cap to square



MERCURY

From dressed up to bare



MERCURY AND GIRLS

They couldn't compare to you!
