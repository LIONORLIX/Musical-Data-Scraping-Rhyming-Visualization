You Don't Remind Me


JUPITER

You don't remind me

Of the iris in spring

Or of dawn up the mountain

When the bluebird starts to sing.



You don't remind me

Of the breeze of the day

Or of stars in the fountain

Where the silver fishes play.



To the moon in September

You relive nor resemble this.

Of the first snow in November

You're not even a similar bliss.



No, you don't remind me

Of the wold aroun or behind me

For so much does my love blind me

That my darling, you only remind me

Of you, of you

Of you.



[Thanks to Julia for lyrics]
