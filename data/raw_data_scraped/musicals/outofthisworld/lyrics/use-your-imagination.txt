Use Your Imagination


HELEN

Use your imagination

Just take this motto for your theme.

And soon every night

Will be crowded with delight

And every day will be a dream.



Use your imagination

You'll see such wonders if you do.

Around you there lies

Pure enchantment in disguise

And endless joys you never knew.



Behind every cloud

There's a so-lovely star.

Behind every star,

There's a lovelier one by far.



So use your imagination

Just take this motto for your theme.

And soon you will dance

On the road to sweet romance

And every day will be a dream.

And every day will be a perfect dream.
