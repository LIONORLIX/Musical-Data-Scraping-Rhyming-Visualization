Hail, Hail, Hail


GODS AND GODDESSES

Regard Mother Juno

In heaven's shmoodly

Beware, Father Jupiter

She's coming back home.



GODDESSES

She's coming back home



GODS

She's coming back home



GODS AND GODDESSES

She's coming back, coming back, coming back home!

She's nearing Pluto.

She's passing Pluto!

She's nearing Neptune.

She's passing Neptune!

She's nearing Uranus.

She's passing Uranus!

She's nearing Saturn.

She's passing Saturn!

She's just past Mars!

She's rounding the moon!

She's on the homestretch,

She'll be here soon!

Come on, Ma

Come on, Ma

Come on, Ma



She's down!



Hail to thee, Juno, our mother.

Empress of the universe,

Queen of the heaven.

Protectress of the earth.

Hail, hail to thee.



Juno, the mother of all creation,

That is to say:

Mother of all things living beneath the sky,

And of all things living within the sea.

Hail, hail to thee!

Hail! Hail! Hail!



JUNO

Hail yourself.

Pluto, recharge the peacocks!

Alright, where's your father?



GODS AND GODDESSES

Hail! Hail! Hail!

Hail, hail, hail, hail, hail, hail, hail.

Hail, hail, hail, hail, hail, hail, hail.

Hail, hail, hail, hail, hail, hail, hail.

Hail!



JUNO

You're all on your old man's side, of course.

He pays your allowance.

Let me tell you, there are plenty of men who'd be honored to pay court to your old

mother... if I wasn't still crazy about the old goat.
