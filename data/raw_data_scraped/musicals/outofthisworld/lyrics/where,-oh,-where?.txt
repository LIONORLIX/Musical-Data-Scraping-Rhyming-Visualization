Where, Oh, Where?


CHLOE

I often ask because I feel

I've every right to ask

Will time take on the task  to reveal

Yes or no,

My beau ideal?



For even though when I'm abed

I dream he holds me tight

Awake, I never light on the man

I plan one day to wed.



Where, oh where

Is that combination so rare?

The cute night in armor,

Completely a charmer,

Who'd still be a millionare?



Where, oh where

Is that combination so rare?

A youth who is able to wrap me in sable,

Who'd still be a love affair?



I could accept a cottage small by a roaring waterfall,

Yet I'd much prefer a castle cool by a marble swimming pool.



But where, oh where

Is that combination so rare?

A highly admissable, kissable boy

To fill me with, practically kill me with joy?

Who'd still be a millionare?

Tell me, where, oh where, oh where?
