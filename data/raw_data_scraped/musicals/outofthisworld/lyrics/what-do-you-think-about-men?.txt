What Do You Think About Men?


HELEN, JUNO, CHLOE

What do you think about men?



CHLOE

What do I think about men?

Oh, men are dreamy,

Men are sweet.

They simply knock me off my feet.

They're so enchanting, so much fun

And I just can't wait until I marry one.

That's what I think about men.



HELEN AND JUNO

That's what you think about men.



CHLOE AND JUNO

What do you think about men?



HELEN

What do I think about men?

Oh, men are only naughty boys,

And we to them are merely toys

They're always up to some new prank

And I know of one that Mama'd love to spank.

That's what I think about men.



CHLOE AND JUNO

That's what you think about men.



CHLOE AND HELEN

What do you think about men?



JUNO

What do I think about men?

Oh, men are just a pair of pants

They're always after fresh romance

In search of fun they run about

And they don't come home until they're all run out.

That's what I think about men.



CHLOE AND HELEN

That's what you think about men.



HELEN, JUNO, CHLOE

We are absolutely certain

As to what we think of men.

But when nght doth draw her curtain

And the hour approacheth ten

When the moon is o'er the mountain

And there's mischief in the glen

No matter what we think about men,

We think about men.



When the moon is o'er the mountain

And there's mischief in the glen

No matter what we think about men,

We think about about men, men, men, men

Men (men), men (men), men (men), men (men), men (men), men (men), men (men)



JUNO

We think about men.
