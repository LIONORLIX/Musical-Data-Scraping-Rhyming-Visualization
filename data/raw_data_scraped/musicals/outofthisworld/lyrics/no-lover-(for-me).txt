No Lover (For Me)


HELEN

No lover,

No lover for me.

My husband suits me to a T.

No lover,

No fiddle-dee-dee

My husband is but heavenly

Since the moment his kisses

Upon me were hurled

It's been all hits,

No misses

For he's just out of this world.

Yes, my husband suits me to a T

So no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

No lover for me.



So many wives i meet today

Complain because theirs husbands won't play

So many wives to find romance

Dash off to Paris

(But not for dresses)

But for carresses made in France.

Let them live their lives.

I'm the most contented of wives.



No lover,

No lover for me.

My husband suits me to a T.

No lover,

No fiddle-dee-dee.

My husband is but heavenly.

There is something about him,

With glamour so glossed,

That each moment without him

Is just paradise lost.

Yes, my husband suits me to a T.

So no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

No lover for me.
