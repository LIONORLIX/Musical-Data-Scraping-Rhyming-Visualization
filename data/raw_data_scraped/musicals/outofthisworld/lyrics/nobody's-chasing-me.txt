Nobody's Chasing Me


JUNO

The breeze is chasing the zepher

The moon is chasing the sea

The bull is chasing the heifer

But nobody's chasing me.



The cook is chasing the e chicken

The pea wakes up, pee-wee-wee

The cat is taking a lickin'

But nobody's taking me.



Nobody wants to own me

And I object

Nobody wants to phone me

Even collect.



The leopard's chasing the leopard

The chimp, some chap chimpanzee

The sheep is chasing the shepherd

But nobody's chasing me.

Nobody!

Nobody's chasing me.



The flood is chasing the levy

The wolf is out on a spree

The Ford is chasing the Chevvy

But nobody's chasing me.



The bee is chasing petunias

The queen is chasing the bee

The worm is chasing the lettuce

But nobody's chasing me.



Each night I get the mirror

From off the shelf

Each night I'm getting queerer,

Chasing myself.



Ravel is chasing Debussy

The avid chases the pee

The gander's chasing the goosey

But nobody's goosing me.

Nobody!

Nobody's chasing me.



The pa is chasing the papa

Papa is chasing Mama

Monseur is chasing Madame

But nobody's chasing moi.



The dove, each moment, is older

The lark speaks muy petite

Triston is chasing Isolde

But nobody's chasing me.



Although I may be Juno,

Believe it or not,

I got a lot of you-know

And you-know-what.



The snake, with passion, is shaking

The pooch is chasing the flea

The moose his love call is making

But nobody's making me.

Nobody!

Nobody's chasing me!
