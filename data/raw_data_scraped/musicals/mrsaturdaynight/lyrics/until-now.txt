Until Now


[BUDDY]

Always had the dream from an early age

To be cracking wise on the center stage

But I never thought I'd get there until now

Sure, I had the will and I had the drive

But who knew that I'd feel so alive

Never thought that I could kill 'em until now

Just to feel the rush that comes up there from knowing

That they're with you, and you know how well it's going

Sure, you run up there like a nervous pup

And you hit 'em hard and they lap it up

And you know your life is forever changed som?how

And I never knew for sur? I had it in me

Until now

Until now

Until now

[ELAINE, spoken]

That must have been amazing!



[BUDDY, spoken]

Yeah, but then it got better!



[ELAINE, spoken]

What?



[BUDDY]

When I walked onstage who would ever guess

I'd see table eight in her fancy dress?

Never lost my cool and timing until now

It was like I saw my whole life in that minute

And the future I could have if you were in it

(spoken)

Maybe I'm getting ahead of myself.



[ELAINE, spoken]

I don't think you are, actually.

(sung)

I could never be just some nice guy's wife

Who will never know what there is in life

No one ever understood that until now

Then you start to talk and I'm in your grip

Like we're taking off on a rocket ship

Never felt something so thrilling until now

[BUDDY & ELAINE]

I guess you never really know what life will make you

Where the rollercoaster ride is gonna take you

It can't be chance, no, it must be fate

To have all I want fall right on my plate

And the perfect night and the perfect date and wow



[BUDDY]

I couldn't add one thing to make you more inviting



[ELAINE]

I never knew someone could make life so exciting



[BUDDY & ELAINE]

Love was nothing but a trap that I was fighting

Until now

Until now

Until now
