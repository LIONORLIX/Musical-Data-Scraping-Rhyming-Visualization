Stick Around


[SUSAN]

So you write the guy off

So the family is through

And there's no happy endings

For people like you



Stick around

Never know what the day will bring you

Stick around

Though you sometimes may wonder why

Life's a trip

People change who you least expected

You were strangers, now you're connected

Hey who knows, maybe pigs can fly

Stick around

It may all go to hell tomorrow

Hold your ground

You have more than you think to show

And he said out loud

That I made him proud

Who's to say how close we could grow?

So stick around

'Cause you never know



[ELAINE]

Stick around

Though this sure as hell ain't Tahiti

Stick around

For the whole rollercoaster ride

Stick around

When you're in it for life, you're in it

And it all goes by in a minute

Fifty years you don't toss aside



Stick around

'Cause your family is all that matters

Stick around

He ain't easy but even so

And there's still that thrill

When you watch him kill

Makes it worth all the crap and so

You stick around

'Cause you never know

[BUDDY, ELAINE & STAN]

Look at us

All together alive and kicking

Still the kids

Doesn't matter how old we grow



[BUDDY]

We're still Abe and Stan

Back where we began



[BUDDY & STAN]

And they're all still Uncle Moe



[ELAINE]

So



[BUDDY, ELAINE & STAN]

Stick around

'Cause you never know



[BUDDY]

One day you feel like you've been forgotten

Lower than gum under someone's shoe



[ANNIE]

But hey pal, you can't have been all that rotten

When you've got this crew of people

Who have stuck around with you

Stick around

It turns out you're not done and finished



[SUSAN]

Stick around

Take a lap on the open track



[ANNIE & SUSAN]

Stick around

Life can still come through with a shocker



[SUSAN]

Even when you're an alte kaker



[BUDDY]

I was dead but now look who's back!



[ALL]

Stick around

Don't you leave while the band's still playing

Ride it out

Who knows which way the wind will blow?

Take the nickel tour

Who can say for sure

They're sure how their life will go?

Stick around

Stick around

Stick around

'Cause you never know
