Maybe It Starts With Me


[SUSAN]

All of my life I've lived under his shadow

Even now

Fighting these fights I never can win

And he gets his way right under my skin

I keep hoping one day things will be different

Don't ask how

He'll finally be the father I wish he'd be

Facing the problem logically

Maybe it's time I finally see

Okay, I get it

Maybe it starts with me

Remember how he made you cry on your birthday?

Yeah, well, so?

All these old memories dragging you down

How long you gonna lug them around?

Mom would always take his side and protect him

Let it go

Save it up for your memoirs or set it free

Plenty of people live with pain

Don't throw their whole lives down the drain

If I'm a screw-up

Maybe it starts with me



Okay, so they weren't the parents I wanted

That's pretty clear

Well, let's be honest, I haven't exactly been

Daughter of the year



So, here I go, starting now, starting over

Wish me luck

Somebody said as long as there's life there is hope

Maybe I'll find the way I lost

I'm gonna keep my fingers crossed

The way I've been going, I can't defend it

This war between us, who's gonna end it?

Christ, what a concept

Maybe, maybe it starts with me
