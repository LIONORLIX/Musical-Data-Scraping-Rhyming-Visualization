My Wonderful Pain In The Ass


[ELAINE]

Funny thing you should have a doubt in your mind

Listen you, like a rash you got this

Shut your trap, they are gonna love you when you let fly

Funny thing, sometimes I could kick your behind

Think about a life that's maybe not this

Then you come with that old look in your eye

Like you're starved and I'm pastrami with Swiss on rye



There's not a day you don't make me crazy

But I wouldn't take back a single one

With all of the prob' life keeps throwing at you

Well Jesus, you better have fun

And though there are times when I'd gladly kill you

I put up with forty years more

You hog the bed

You give me gas

You'll knock 'em dead

My wonderful pain in the ass

[BUDDY]

Funny thing, I'm the one supposed to be strong

Look at me acting like a baby

Funny thing, I thought when we met I was saving you

Funny thing, you put up with me for this long

I drive you nuts, I make a mess, well maybe

Spotting you on that night out of the blue

That's one thing I did rightâ€”still can't believe it's true



[ELAINE & BUDDY]

There's not a day you don't make me crazy



[BUDDY]

The ace up my sleeve, my one great success

Me, I'm a wreck, but you're still and always

The girl in the polka-dot dress



[ELAINE & BUDDY]

Though there's not much fun in growing older

I'd sign up for forty years more



[BUDDY]

You give me hope

You give me class



[ELAINE]

You make me laugh

You take my sass

[BUDDY]

I love you, signed

Your personal pain in the ass



[ELAINE]

You're looking good



[BUDDY]

You must be blind



[ELAINE]

You think we could?



[BUDDY]

Might take some time



[ELAINE & BUDDY]

I love you, signed

Your wonderful pain in the ass
