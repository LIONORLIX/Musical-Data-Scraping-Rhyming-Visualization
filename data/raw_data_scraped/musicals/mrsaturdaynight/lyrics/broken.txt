Broken


[STAN]

So you needed me back

So I gave up my own life and tough

But no matter how much that I give you

It's never enough

Then you do one more terrible thing

That I'm forced to defend

Where does it end, Abie?

Where does it end?



God knows I tried

But something inside is broken

I gave up my life to help you

And you don't care

You break my heart

You don't have a clue

You just go and make it all about you

You're broken, broken, broken

And you say that you'll change, you'll be different this time

But you won't

That you value my help, but come on

We both know that you don't

I'm here waiting for you

To show some sort of love in your heart

When does it start, Buddy?

When does it start?

Breaking apart, Buddy?

Breaking apart



I never learn, I always return

I'm broken

I've always known but now I can clearly see

I leave and come back

We make up and still

The cracks that we mend

Grow deeper until

We're broken, broken, broken

Broken

You and me
