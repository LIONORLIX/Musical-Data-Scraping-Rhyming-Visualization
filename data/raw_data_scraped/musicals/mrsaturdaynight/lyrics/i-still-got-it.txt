I Still Got It


[STAN, spoken]

Buddy, if it's over, let it be over.



[BUDDY, spoken]

Not like this, Stan.

(sung)

Look at me, Stan

They left me for dead

So now what the hell have I got?

So let's make a plan

Maybe instead

This could lead to one more shot

Stan, you know I know you know I can do it

In my bones, nothing to it

I'll be funny 'til the day I die

Sure I'm old, but look, my mic hand is steady

Still upright and I'm ready

Do I pack away the tux and tie

And lie here growing fungus?

That's what they want me to do

I'm nowhere, Stan

But nowhere nearly through

I wanna show those bastards



I still got it

I still got it

Stan, all I need is a shot

I still got it

I still got it

You can choke on all the its that I got



No mor? playing brisses and bar mitzvahs

Sundays at the Szechuan buff?t

All that starts changing tomorrow when I'm on "Today"

I wanna hear 'em say



And he's still got it

Yes, he's still got it

Lungs you can't lift with a crane

I still got it

I still got it

And not just for me but Elaine

All dolled up

And looking like a million

The light there in her eyes I used to see

She ain't got it easy

Let's face it, she's married to me

But we could show her



Oh, Stan

What I was way back then

I could have that back again

I could be, still could be

That guy

That guy



Come on Stan, our work ain't done here

Look, life is passing us by

I got one more shot before I die

We're gonna hear 'em sayin'



[BUDDY & STAN]

He's still got it

He's still got it

Still got the goods, got the juice



[BUDDY, spoken]

Follow me, Stan!

[BUDDY & STAN]

He's still got it

He's still got it



[BUDDY]

I got it coming out my caboose

Write my sitcom, "Here Comes Buddy!"

Jerry Seinfeld has a fuckin' cow



[BUDDY & STAN]

We're Abie and Stan

Just like we began



[BUDDY]

And nothing and no one and nobody's stopping me

Now!

(spoken)

Still got it!
