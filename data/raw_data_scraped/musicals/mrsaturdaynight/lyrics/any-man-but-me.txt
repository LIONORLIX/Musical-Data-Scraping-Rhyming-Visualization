Any Man But Me


[BUDDY]

Any man but me would say I'm sorry

Any man but me would say don't go

Grab him tight and ask him to forgive me

That's the kind of stuff that any man would know

Always got to prove that I know better

Why can't I for once just let it be?

Will I ever learn to be like any man but me?



All my life I've always been a fighter

Right or wrong, that's just the way it is

You go around and show the world your weakness

And you won't last thirty seconds in this biz

It's more than fifty years of mister tough guy

Hey tough guy! Are you where you wanna be?

I'm out of luck and out of rope

And out of friends and out of hope

You'd think I would have changed but nope

That's any man but me

What if I got to start all over?

Instead of b?ing bitter?

Instead of being mad?

What if for onc? I was just grateful?

Grateful for the life that I had?



Any man would know he's good and lucky

Why did it take all this time to see?

The things that really matter more

The stuff that's worth the fighting for

It's all been there in front of me

If only I could learn to be

Like any man

Any man

But me
