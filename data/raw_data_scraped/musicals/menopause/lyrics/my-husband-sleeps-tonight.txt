My Husband Sleeps Tonight


Weeeee.. We um baum baum away

Weeeee.. We um baum baum away

(Shes a witch, shes a witch,

shes a bitch, shes a bitch

Shes a witch, shes a witch,

shes a bitch, shes a bitch

Shes a witch, shes a witch,

shes a bitch, shes a bitch

Shes a witch, shes a witch,

shes a bitch, shes a bitch)



In the guestroom or on the sofa,

my husband sleeps at night;

In the guestroom or on the sofa

my husband sleeps at night.



Weeeee.. We um baum baum away

Weeeee.. We um baum baum away

(Shes a witch, shes a witch,

shes a bitch, shes a bitch

Shes a witch, shes a witch,

shes a bitch, shes a bitch

Shes a witch, shes a witch,

shes a bitch, shes a bitch

Shes a witch, shes a witch,

shes a bitch, shes a bitch)



In his workshop or on the rooftop

my husband spends his day.

In his workshop or on the rooftop

my huband spends his day.



Weeeee.. We um baum baum away

Weeeee.. We um baum baum away

(Shes a witch, shes a witch,

shes a bitch, shes a bitch

Shes a witch, shes a witch,

shes a bitch, shes a bitch

Shes a witch, shes a witch,

shes a bitch, shes a bitch

Shes a witch, shes a witch,

shes a bitch, shes a bitch)



(Monkey and jungle sounds)



Hush now girlfriend,

take cheer oh girlfriend,

your husband will return

Hush now girlfriend,

Weeeee.. We um baum baum away

Weeeee.. We um baum baum away

(Shes a witch, shes a witch,

shes a bitch, shes a bitch

Shes a witch, shes a witch,

shes a bitch, shes a bitch

Shes a witch, shes a witch,

shes a bitch, shes a bitch

Shes a witch, shes a witch,

shes a bitch, shes a bitch)





Weeeee.. We um baum baum away

Weeeee.. We um baum baum away
