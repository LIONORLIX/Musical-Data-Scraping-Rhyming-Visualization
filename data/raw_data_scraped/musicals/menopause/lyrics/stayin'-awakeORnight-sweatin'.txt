Stayin' Awake/Night Sweatin'


Well you can tell by the way I slump my walk,

Iam a tired a girl, no strength to talk;

In the mirror, my eyes so red, I've been up all night, sittin in my bed.

Well it's not alright, not ok and you can look the other way

My husband trys to understand, it's just no concept for a man,



Whether you're a sister or whether you're a mother, your stayin awake,stayin awake,

see the sunrise breakin and you're up cooking bacon and you're stayin awake, stayin awake,



ah ah ah ah staying awake,staying awake

ah ah ah ah staying awake...

I'm staying awake



I use to drink and celebrate,

never use to mind stayin out too late

now it seems I need my zzzzz

or I'm cranky, crabby, hard to please

We it's not alright, not ok and you can look the other way,

My lover tries to understand, it's just no concept for a nan



Whether you're a sister or whether you're a mother, your stayin awake,stayin awake,

see the sunrise breakin and you're up cooking bacon and you're stayin awake, stayin awake,



ah ah ah ah staying awake,staying awake

ah ah ah ah staying awake...

We're staying awake



Listen to me growl,

on my face there is a scowl,

there is something going down,

I can feel it.



From my teeth to my toes

a burning heat grows

It's not that I__?______

I just feel it.



And that sweet sweaty woman

the witch of the night

loosing her mind and control

don't reach out for me

cause it burning ___?_________



You got that night sweatin' night sweating'

we know how you feeling;

You got that night sweatin' night sweating;

don't we all just know it.



There I am;

praying for this moment to pass,

drowing on the sheets I just changed, night shirt is drenched,

feeling derranged.



You've got that night sweatin' night sweating' we know how you feeling..

Feels like a river baby baby..

You've got that night sweatin' night sweating, don't we all just know it.



With this heat in the night

don't need no drugs for me to make it...

well just enough to make it...to the morning.



I've got fire on my face

I got I've got fire on my footsoles

I am glowing in the dark

This is a warning.



And that sweet sweaty woman

the witch of the night

loosing her mind and control

don't reach out for me

cause it burning ____________



You got that night sweatin' night sweating'

we know how you feeling..

Feels like a river baby baby..

You got that night sweatin' night sweating,

don't we all just know it.



Night Sweatin.
