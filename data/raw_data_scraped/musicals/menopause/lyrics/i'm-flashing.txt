I'm Flashing


I'm flashing

just flashing

and the glow is not my jewels

I didn't know.. the change could be so crewl



ohhh yes



They tell me, feeling flushed

is part of passing through

But I just soaked

another blouse thats new



ohhh yes



(She's Flashing) I'm flashing

(Just Flashing) Just Flashing

Please accept my apology,

but estrogens gone

and I'm on my own, you see.



[Thanks to Susan for lyrics]
