In A Foreign City


In a foreign city

In a slinky dress

The weather's looking stormy,

My hair is quite a mess

I lost my lover Billy

Unlucky me, I guess

Now I'm in a foreign city

In a slinky dress



My other clothes are gone now

The hotel kept them all

'Cause Billy took our money

I guess I took a fall

When Billy said to kiss him

Oh why did I say yes?

Now I'm in a foreign city

In a slinky dress



Got bad taste choosing a lover

I sure can't pick 'em

It's simply insane

When it's time to run for cover

I'm like a fool who thinks it's sunny

When it's pouring rain



I'm in a foreign city

In a slinky dress

The rickshaw boys ignore me

So what? I could care less

I need a job tomorrow

I'm scared, I must confess

Scared to be in a foreign city

In a slinky dress

A slinky dress

[Spoken] Slinky dress
