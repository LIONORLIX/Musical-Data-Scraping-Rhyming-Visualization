Grumpy Mood


In a foreign city

In a grumpy mood

I've just arrived from somewhere

Need a place, and need some food

Won't carry too much with me

It's okay sleeping nude

But that's too much information

For a grumpy mood



Can't go home so I must wonder

As to the reason, I don't wanna say

Travelin' though here, there, and yonder

Travelin' is fine but gee I'm missin'

The good old U.S.A.



In a foreign city

In a grumpy mood

I need some relaxation

Need to stare a bit and brood

It's raining, I've a headache

and I've got an attitude

'Cause I'm in a foreign city in a slinky dress

I mean a grumpy mood

A grumpy, grouchy, mood!
