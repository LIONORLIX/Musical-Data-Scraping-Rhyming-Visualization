You Are Love


(The upper deck of the "Cotton Blossom," Later that night.

It is moonlight, just after the storm clouds have broken.

RAVENAL stands near a water barrel. He looks about, anxiously

awaiting MAGNOLIA. He blows on his fingers, and moves about

a little to take off the chill that is characteristic of

southern nights. He hears a noise. He peers into the darkness

and calls eagerly off L.:)



RAVENAL

That you, Nola?



WINDY

(off stage)

Nope - it's me.



RAVENAL

(quickly filling dipper from water barrel to carry

on the illusion that he came out here to get a drink)

Hello, Windy -



WINDY

(entering)

Come over to take a look at the moorings -

(He crosses RAVENAL)

Kind o' cool for you to be stayin' out on deck, ain't it?



RAVENAL

(just finishing drink)

Er - no - not at all - I'm very thirsty, that's all.

(He fills the dipper again to prove it. WINDY exits, chuckling.

RAVENAL pours the balance of the dipper's contents into the fire

bucket. He hears a whistle off stage)

That you, Nola?

(MAGNOLIA enters. She carries a porcelain water pitcher.

He flings the dipper away and rushes to her impetuously.

He embraces her)

How did you get away?



MAGNOLIA

I can't stay long - I told Mother I'd fill her pitcher -

She's waiting -



RAVENAL

(speaking rapidly, excitedly, impulsive)

Nola - we haven't much time - listen,

I want to marry you - in Natchez tomorrow.



MAGNOLIA

But Mother -



RAVENAL

She's going to be in Fayette all morning -

she told me so herself - there's a lovely

little church in Natchez -



MAGNOLIA

But Father - what will he say?



RAVENAL

He will not oppose us - as a matter of fact,

he gave me the idea -



MAGNOLIA

What!



RAVENAL

Of getting married while your mother was away -

he knows how I feel - how much I love you - oh,

Nola, please - say you will -



MAGNOLIA

Oh, Gay - I want to -



RAVENAL

You can make me the happiest man in the world. I can't

stand it this way any longer - these stolen seconds,

these little snatches of you! I want you all to myself -

forever. Nola, dearest - I want you with me wherever I go.

I want to show you a world you've never dreamed of -

cities, theatres, restaurants, people - and you and I

always together, looking on - and living in our own

lovers' world.



MAGNOLIA

But Gay - you've seen everything in the world.



RAVENAL

I used to think so - until I looked into your eyes - and

then I knew that I had seen nothing - I hadn't even lived.



Once a wand'ring ne'er-do-well,

Just a vagrant roving fellow,

I went my way.

Life was just a joke to tell,

Like a lonely Punchinello

My role was gay.

But I knew the joke was aimless,

Time went on, I liked the game less,

For, you see,

Somewhere lurked a spark divine

And I kept wond'ring whether mine

Would come to me.

Then my fortune turned and I found you.

Here you are with my arms around you.

You will never know what you've meant to me.



MAGNOLIA

You're the prize that Heaven has sent to me.



RAVENAL

Here's a bright and beautiful world, all new,

Wrapped up in you.

You are love,

Here in my arms

Where you belong,

And here you will stay,

I'll not let you away;

I want day after day

With you.

You are spring,

Bud of romance unfurled;

You taught me to see

One truth forever true.

You are love,

Wonder of all the world.

Where you go with me,

Heaven will always be.



MAGNOLIA

You are love,

Here in my arms

Where you belong,

And here you will stay,

I'll not let you away;

I want day after day

With you.

You are Spring,

Bud of romance unfurled -

You taught me to see

One truth forever true.



MAGNOLIA & RAVENAL

You are love,

Wonder of all the world.

Where you go with me,

Heaven will always be.

(MAGNOLIA looks up at him for a moment, then, of her

own accord, throws her arms around him. They kiss)



PARTHY

(off stage)

Nola!

(They break)



MAGNOLIA & RAVENAL

Good night - dream if you can -



RAVENAL

My wife -



MAGNOLIA

My man -

(She exits. He's exultant. Fade out)
