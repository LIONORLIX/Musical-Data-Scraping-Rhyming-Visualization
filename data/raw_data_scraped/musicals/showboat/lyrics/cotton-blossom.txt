Cotton Blossom


[Stevedores]

Here we all work on de Mississippi

Here we all work while de white folks play,

Loadin' up boots wid de bales of cotton,

Gettin' no rest till de Judgement Day.



[Gals]

Drop dat bale and have some fun!

Dere's a lot o' lovin' on de levee for you

Y' work all day, y' get no fun~

We know somethin' better for a feller to do!



[Stevedores and Gals]

Here we all work on de Mississippi

Here we all work while de white folks play~

Loadin' up boats wid de bales of cotton

Gittin' no rest till de Judgement Day.



[Stevedores]

Cotton Blossom, Cotton Blossom,

Love to see you growin' free.

When dey pack you on de levee

You're a heavy load to me!



[Stevedores and Gals]

Cotton Blossom, Cotton Blossom,

Love to see you growin' wild~

On de levee, you're too heavy

Fo' dis po' ol' child!



[Beaux]

What a pretty bevy!

Ah, there! Ah, there!

The fairest of the fair!

To Southern beauty

Ev'ry beau must bow!



[Mincing Misses]

How you love to flatter,

You rogues! You rogues!

Oh, goodness gracious!

They're so flirtatious!



You naughty fellows

Seem to think you please us

When you tease us so~

You're a reckless

Lot we know!



[Beaux]

Little women, don't be timorous!

You will find, acting thus

Only makes a man more bold!

These are not the days of old!



See! The Show Boat,

That's old Captain Andy's "Cotton Blossom"

Will you go?

Let me take you to the show!



[Mincing Misses]

'Twill be delightful

But to rightfully accept,

I have to make mama

Get permission from papa!



[Beaux and Misses]

Captain Andy has gathered a troupe

In the grandest of drammers and jolly comedies,

Stephen Baker, the handsomest leading man,

And beautiful Julie Laverne as well!



[Beaux]

Cotton Blossom, Cotton Blossom

Captain Andy's Floating Show!

Thrills and laughter

Concert after

Ev'rybody's sure to go!



[Beaux and Misses]

Cotton Blossom, Cotton Blossom

Captain Andy's Floating Show!

Thrills and laughter

Concert after

Get your girl and go!

So get your girl and go
