Goodbye, My Lady Love


So you're going away

Because my heart has gone astray

And you promised me

That you would always faithful be.



Go to him you love

And be as true as stars above.

But your heart will yearn

And then someday you will return



Goodbye, my lady love,

Farewell, my turtle dove,

You are the idol and darling of my heart,

But some day you will come back to me

And love me tenderly,

So goodbye, my lady love, goodbye.





When the dewdrops fall

This then your heart, I know, will call.

So beware, my dove,

Don't trust your life to some false love.



But if you must go,

Remember, dear, I love you so;

Sure as the stars do shine,

You'll think of when I called you mine.



Goodbye, my lady love,

Farewell my turtle dove,

You are the idol and darling of my heart,

But some day you will come back to me

And love me tenderly,

(So) goodbye, my lady love, goodbye.
