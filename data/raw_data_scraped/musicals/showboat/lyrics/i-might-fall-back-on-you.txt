I Might Fall Back on You


FRANK

Little girl, you are safe with me:

I can protect what's mine;

I am a sturdy maple tree

And you're my clinging vine!



ELLIE

Woods are just full of maple trees,

Cedar and oak and pine;

Let me look them over, please,

And then I'll let you know

If you have a show.

After I have looked around

The world for a mate,

Then, perhaps, I might fall back on you!

When I am convinced

That there is no better fate,

Then I might decide that you will do.



FRANK

I am just an average lad,

Though no gift to womanhood,

Some girls say I'm not so bad!



ELLIE

Others say you're not so good!

But if you are patient, dear,

And willing to wait,

There's a chance I might fall back on you!



FRANK & ELLIE

After I/you have looked around

The world for a mate

Then, perhaps, I/you might fall back on you/me!

When I/you are convinced

That there is no better fate,

Then I/you might decide that you/I will do!



FRANK

I am just an average lad,

Though no gift to womanhood,

Some girls say I'm not so bad!



ELLIE

Others say you're not so good!



FRANK & ELLIE

But if you are/I am patient, dear,

And willing to wait,

There's a chance I/you might fall back on you/me!

(Two groups of GIRLS dance on)



GROUP 1

(to FRANK)

After she has looked around

The world for a mate

Then, perhaps, she might fall back on you!

When she is convinced

That there is no better fate

Then she might decide that you will do!



GROUP 2

(to ELLIE)

He is just an average lad,

Though no gift to womanhood,

Some girls say he's not so bad,

Others say he's not so good!



ALL GIRLS

(to FRANK)

But if you are patient, dear,

And willing to wait

There's a chance she might fall back on you!
