Why Do I Love You?


MAGNOLIA

I'm walking on the air, dear,

For life is fair, dear,

To lovers;

I'm in the seventh heaven

(There's more than seven,

My heart discovers).



RAVENAL

In this sweet, improbable and unreal world,

Finding you has given me my ideal world.



MAGNOLIA

Why do I love you?

Why do you love me?



MAGNOLIA & RAVENAL

Why should there be two

Happy as we?



RAVENAL

Can you see

The why or wherefore

I should be

The one you care for?



MAGNOLIA

You're a lucky boy,

I am lucky too.



MAGNOLIA & RAVENAL

All our dreams of joy

Seem to come true.

Maybe that's because you love me,

Maybe that's why I love you.



CHORUS

Why do I love you?

Why do you love me?

Why should there be two

Happy as we?

Can you see

The why or wherefore

I should be

The one you care for?

You're a lucky boy,

I am lucky, too.

All our dreams of joy

Seem to come true.

Maybe that's because you love me,

Maybe that's why I love you.



RAVENAL

Darling, I have only

Just an hour to play.



MAGNOLIA

I am always lonely

When you go away.



CHORUS

Hours are not like years,

So dry your tears!

What a pair of lovebirds!



RAVENAL

My darling,

I'll come home as early as I can,

Meanwhile be good and patient with your man.

Why do I love you?



MAGNOLIA

Why do you love me?

(RAVENAL exits)



CHORUS

Why should there be two

Happy as we?

Can you see

The why or wherefore

I should be

The one you care for?

You're a lucky boy,

I am lucky, too.

All our dreams of joy,

Seem to come true.

Maybe that's because you love me,

Maybe that's why I love you!

(MAGNOLIA waltzes, then exits)



CHORUS

You're a lucky boy!

I am lucky, too,

All our dreams of joy

Seem to come true.

Maybe that's because you love me,

Maybe that's why I love you!

(CAPTAIN ANDY and PARTHY enter)



ANDY

(to PARTHY)

Why do I love you?

Why do you love me?

Why should there be two

Happy as we?

Can you see

The why or wherefore

I should be

The one you care for?

I'm a lucky boy,

You are lucky, too.

All our dreams of joy

Seem to come true!

Maybe that's because you love me,

Maybe that's why I love you!

(ANDY dances, attempting to make PARTHY dance with him.

She sternly refuses. ANDY persists. Finally, a faint smile

flickering across her lips, she deigns to do a few little steps)



CHORUS

You're a lucky boy!

I am lucky too!

All our dreams of joy

Seem to come true!

Maybe that's because you love me,

Maybe that's why I love you!
