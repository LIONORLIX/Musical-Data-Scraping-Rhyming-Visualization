In Dahomey


(DAHOMEY VILLAGERS come out of the Village and come down stage.

The crowd moves upstage and onto the steps of the buildings)

WHITE CHORUS

Don't let us stay here,

For though they may play here,

They are acting vicious,

They might get malicious

And though I'm not fearful

I'll not be a spearful,

So you better show me

The way from Dahomey!



DAHOMEYS

(chanting)

Ah ah! Ah ah!

Ah ah ah ah ah ah!

Ah ah! Ah ah!

Ah ah ah ah ah ah!

(The CROWD exits in fear)



DAHOMEYS

We're glad to see them go!

We're glad to see those white folks go!

We've had enough

Of all this stuff -

We wish we'd never come here

To join a Dahomey show!



In Dahomey -

Let the Africans stay

In Dahomey -

Gimme Avenue A

Back in old New York

Where yo' knife and fork

Gently sink into juicy little chops

what's made of pork!

We are wild folks

When de ballyhoos bawl,

But we're mild folks

When we're back in de Kraal,

'Cause our home(our little home),

Our home ain't in Dahomey at all!

Oh, take me back today to Avenue A!



(ZULU DANCE)
