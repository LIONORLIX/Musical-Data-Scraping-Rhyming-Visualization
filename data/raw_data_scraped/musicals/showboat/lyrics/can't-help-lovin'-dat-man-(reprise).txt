Can't Help Lovin' Dat Man (reprise)


(MAGNOLIA sits with her guitar across her knees, throws her head back,

closes her eyes and starts to sing "Can't Help Lovin' Dat Man." At first

her voice falters, then she gets into it and sings it with fine feeling

and sincerity. JIM, JAKE and FRANK listen, spellbound. No-one moves an

inch. As MAGNOLIA sings, JULIE enters quietly up stage, passes behind the

piano, and recognizes MAGNOLIA. She takes a couple of steps up to her,

but directly behind her. She stands there during the song until the next to

last line, when she seems to arrive at a decision. She makes a shy, hesitant

little gesture, which is half throwing a kiss. She disappears quickly and

softly up stage. Nobody on stage has seen her. MAGNOLIA finishes the song)



MAGNOLIA

Fish gotta swim, birds gotta fly,

I gotta love one man till I die,

Can't help lovin' dat man of mine.

Tell me he's lazy, tell me he's slow,

Tell me I'm crazy, maybe I know.

Can't help lovin' dat man of mine.

When he goes away, dat's a rainy day,

And when he comes back dat day is fine,

De sun will shine!

He kin come home as late as kin be,

Home widout him ain't no home to me,

Can't help lovin' dat man of mine!

(There is a pause)



FRANK

Whaddaya say, boss?



JIM

Lousy! What kind of a coon song do you call that?

(to MAGNOLIA)

You don't sing bad - but that song -



MAGNOLIA

(her temper aroused)

That song is the most beautiful song I know. And if

you don't like it, I'm sorry for you.



JIM

You're sorry for me? Say!



FRANK

Say, Mr. Greene, this little girl ain't so bad.

Can't you use her?



JIM

I can't afford to take chances on amachoors with a two thousand

dollar production. Now wait a minute, will ya, lemme think!

(He stands pondering the problem and running his fingers

through his hair. He looks MAGNOLIA over appraisingly)

Her poisenality is all right - if we could only teach

her some up-to date numbers.



JAKE

Well, that song she sang ain't so bad, boss. Ya know,

we could trick that - like this -



(He plays and sings in ragtime tempo)

Da da da de dum dum dum

Dum dum dum de dum dum dum!



FRANK (eagerly)

Oh, you mean rag it!



JAKE

Yeah! 'Course, we gotta change the words too, see, and then,

near the finish, put in a couple o' gags, like this...

Dum dum dum de dum dum dum - catch line!

Dum dum dum de dum dum dum - 'nother catch line!

See what I mean?



JIM

Say, that's all right!



FRANK

Come on, Nolie, try it this way.



MAGNOLIA

(bewildered)

How do you mean?



FRANK

Follow Jake.

(JAKE and MAGNOLIA start the song together -

but he soon leaves her far behind)



JIM

(interrupting)

No - no!!! Rag it, he means.



FRANK

Rag it, honey, look...

(He sings to show her)

Fish gotta swim, birds gotta fly,

Fish gotta swim, birds gotta fly!



MAGNOLIA

(willing to try)

Oh, I know! Alright, go ahead.

(JAKE plays. As MAGNOLIA sings in ragtime, FRANK

starts to dance like mad)



FRANK

(dancing frantically)

What do you say, Boss, what do you say?



JIM

All right! FRANK

Does she get the job?



JIM

Sure!



FRANK

Great!



(FRANK falls to the stage dancing so fast and continues

twitching his head, body and legs with the music until

the curtain falls)
