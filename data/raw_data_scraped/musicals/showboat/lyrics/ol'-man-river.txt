Ol' Man River


JOE

Dere's an ol' man called de Mississippi;

Dat's de ol' man dat I'd like to be!

What does he care if de world's got troubles?

What does he care if de land ain't free?



Ol' Man River,

Dat Ol' Man River

He mus' know sumpin'

But don't say nuthin',

He jes' keeps rollin',

He keeps on rollin' along.

He don' plant taters,

He don' plant cotton,

An' dem dat plants 'em

Is soon forgotten,

But Ol' Man River,

He jes' keeps rollin' along.

You an' me, we sweat an strain,

Body all achin' an' racked wid pain -

Tote dat barge!

Lift dat bale!

Git a little drunk,

An' you land in jail...

Ah gits weary

An' sick of tryin';

Ah'm tired of livin'

An' skeered of dyin',

But Ol' Man River,

He jes' keeps rollin' along.



(BARGE MEN enter, pulling rope, during the following

verse. The curtains close in, leaving JOE and MALE CHORUS

in front, in one)



Niggers all work on de Mississippi

Niggers all work while de white folks play,

Pullin' dem boats from de dawn to sunset,

Gittin' no rest till de Judgement Day.



MEN

Don' look up

An' don' look down

You don' dast make

De white boss frown.

Bend your knees

An' bow your head,

An' pull dat rope

Until yo' dead.



JOE

Let me go 'way from the Mississippi

Let me go 'way from de white man boss;

Show me dat stream called de river Jordan,

Dat's de ol' stream dat I long to cross.



MEN

Ol' Man River,

Dat Ol' Man River,

He mus' know sumpin'

But don't say nuthin',

He jes' keeps rollin',

He keeps on rollin' along.



JOE

Long ol' river forever keeps rollin' on...



MEN

He don' plant taters,

He don' plant cotton,

An' dem dat plants 'em

Is soon forgotten,

But Ol' Man River,

He jes' keeps rollin' along.



JOE

Long ol' river keeps hearing dat song.

You an' me, we sweat an' strain,

Body all achin' and racked wid pain -

Tote dat barge!

Lift dat bale!

Git a little drunk

An' you land in jail...



JOE & MEN

Ah gits weary

An' sick of tryin';

Ah'm tired of livin'

An' skeered of dyin',

But Ol' Man River,

He jes' keeps rollin' along!
