Make Believe


Only make believe I love you,

Only make believe that you love me.

Others find peace of mind in pretending -

Couldn't you?

Couldn't I?

Couldn't we?

Make believe our lips are blending

In a phantom kiss, or two, or three.

Might as well make believe I love you,

For to tell the truth, I do.

(He steps back)

Your pardon I pray,

'Twas too much to say

The words that betray my heart.



MAGNOLIA

We only pretend,

You do not offend

In playing a lover's part.

The game of just supposing

Is the sweetest game I know.

Our dreams are more romantic

Than the world we see



RAVENAL

And if the things we dream about

Don't happen to be so,

That's just an unimportant technicality.



MAGNOLIA

Though the cold and brutal fact is

You and I have never met,

We need not mind convention's P's and Q's.

If we put our thoughts in practice

We can banish all regret

Imagining most anything we choose.

We could make believe I love you,

We could make believe that you love me.



MAGNOLIA & RAVENAL

Others find peace of mind in pretending,

Couldn't you,

Couldn't I?

Couldn't we?



RAVENAL

Make believe our lips are blending

In a phantom kiss - or two - or three.



MAGNOLIA & RAVENAL

Might as well make believe I love you,



RAVENAL

For to tell the truth, I do...

(RAVENAL reaches up and kisses MAGNOLIA's hand.

They stand and gaze at each other. VALLON enters

from R. followed by JOE, who is carrying a sack

of flour, which he places on stage up C.)



VALLON

Ravenal - the Judge'd like to see you.



RAVENAL

What for?



VALLON

Nothin' serious - but I reckon you'd better come along

and have a talk with him.

(RAVENAL turns to MAGNOLIA)

You will excuse me, ma'am? I hope I'll see you again -

in a little while.

(He bows and exits grandly with VALLON, patting

the top of his hat with a flourish and swinging his

cane. MAGNOLIA looks after him adoringly. Then

she sees JOE looking at RAVENAL curiously)



MAGNOLIA

Oh, Joe! Did you see that young man I was talkin' to?

(JOE turns)



JOE

Mornin', Miss Nola... Yep - I seed him - seed a lot

like him on de river -



MAGNOLIA

Oh, Joe, he was such a gentleman! Have you seen Miss Julie?

I got to tell her - I got to ask her what she thinks -

(MAGNOLIA exits L.)



JOE

Better ask de ol' river what he thinks - he knows

all 'bout dem boys... he knows all 'bout everythin'...

(JOE sits on a box, takes out a knife, picks up a shaving

and starts to whittle, idly, as he sings:)
