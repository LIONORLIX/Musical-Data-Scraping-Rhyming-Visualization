Judgment Day


I sit among my charts and maps

And hear the lonely call of taps

Like the wind across the moon



Captain Emmett Lochran

I pray to God that I am right

And then I send boys off to fight

Travel home in boxes far too soon



Both

God have mercy on my soul

For all the years that I have stolen

From the men who follow what I say

And may their families all forgive

The orders I so calmly give them

As I march their sons into harm's way



Captain Emmett Lochran

I write to mothers of their sons

And say they were the bravest ones

Then I pour a drink and sleep



Private Sam Taylor

But sleep is only filled with drums

A slice of death till morning comes

The heart of darkness where my soul can weep



Both

Come walk a mile in bloody shoes

And lose the men that I am losing

Watch them pay the piper for my tune

Come walk among their ghosts with me

And look through eyes too used to seeing

Faces who have joined the lost platoon



Come Judgment Day, God only knows

If man will reap the pain he sows

And what will be the price he has to pay

But down here on the killing floor

Among the crimson rags of war

For me each day I live is Judgment Day

Every day for me is Judgment Day



All soldiers

God have mercy on my soul

For all the years that I have stolen

From my brothers, be they blue or gray

And may their families all forgive

The bayonet I rush to give them

As we march ourselves into harm's way



Down here on the killing floor

I hear the bloody sounds of war

And watch a thousand more souls slip away

Captain Billy Pierce

Watch them slip away

All soldiers

And sometimes it's too much to bear

The dead and dying everywhere

Every day for me is Judgment Day



Captain Emmett Lochran

Sometimes it's too much to bear

The dead and dying everywhere

Every day for me is Judgment Day

Both Captains

Every day for me is Judgment Day
