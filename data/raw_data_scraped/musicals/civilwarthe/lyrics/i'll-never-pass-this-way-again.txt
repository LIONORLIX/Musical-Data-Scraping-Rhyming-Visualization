I'll Never Pass This Way Again


Corporal Henry Stewart

I was born beside this river

'Bout a half a mile from here

But I never seemed to notice

That the water ran this clear

And I've never seen that color green

Sparkle down the glen

Now I'll never pass this way again



I have wandered through that orchard

And played among her trees

But I never heard the secrets

That she whispers on the breeze

For the only sound on hallowed ground

Is the silence of the men

Who will never pass this way again



It never shone as beautiful

As how it looks today

We never miss the things we love

Till they go away

But I have heard the bugler's call

And it's time for me to leave

Cause there comes a day when a man must say

I will die for what I believe

I have often thrown my pennies

In that old wishing well

And if I had a penny

I would wish me a spell

I would kneel and pray that here I'd stay

Forever and amen

But I'll never pass this way

No I'll never pass this way

No I'll never pass this way again
