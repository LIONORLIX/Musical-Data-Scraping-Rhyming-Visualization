Oh! Be Joyful!


Soldier 1

When this war is over

And we all have passed away



Soldier 2

There'll be some damn fool in some damn school

Who'll write about today



Soldier 3

He'll tell 'em how we all survived

This bullshit every day



Autolycus Fell

And never say that thing it was

That helped along the way



Good evening, gentlemen.

I am offering the finest Chakta whiskey

Known by various appelations

Such as Oil of Gladness, Hangover, Knock 'em Stiff, and Oh, Be Joyful!

Guaranteed to entertain an after-dinner stomach

And provide you with revealing commentary on human nature

Two dollars a pour

That's all you'll want, or like to stand



Soldiers

Oh be joyful, makes my troubles disappear

A cup of oh be joyful makes me joyful I am here

Oh be joyful, only you can set me free

If you're good enough for U.S. Grant

You're good enough for me



We get up every morning

And we march through all this mud

Always tonin' this and liftin' that

And eatin' some ole' spud

And if you find a woman

You are bound to catch the crud

But there is always one thing

That will ossify the blood

Oh be joyful, makes my troubles disappear

A cup of Oh be joyful makes me joyful I am here

Oh be joyful, only you can set me free

If you're good enough for U.S. Grant

You're good enough for me



Bad shoes, bad food, and lousy brass

Oh be joyful save my ass

Well, we march and do the double-quick

This sergeant's too damn rough

This Dixie mud is mighty slick

And this bread is hard and tough

That's the crap they put us through

But brother we obey

So thank God for his nectar

That will get us through the day

Oh be joyful, makes my troubles disappear

A cup of oh be joyful makes me joyful I am here

Oh be joyful, only you can set me free

If you're good enough for U.S. Grant

You're good enough for me
