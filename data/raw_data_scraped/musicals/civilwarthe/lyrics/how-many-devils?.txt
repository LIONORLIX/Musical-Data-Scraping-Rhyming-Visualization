How Many Devils?


Soldiers

One, two

Pick 'em up and put 'em down again

And watch the miles roll by

Three, four

Pick 'em up and put 'em down again

Until you lay down and you die

One, two

Pick 'em up and put 'em down again

Until your legs start to scream

Three, four

Lay your blanket on the bloody ground

And pray to God you won't dream

One, two

Those damn Yankees ain't as give up easy

As we thought they would be

Three, four

Those damn Yankees ain't as near as scared

Or half as hungry as me

One, two

Pick 'em up and put 'em down again

Is all a body can do

Three, four

Pick 'em up and put 'em down again

Until this bloody war is through



How many miles, how many fears

How many days, how many years

How many rivers of blood, sweat and tears?

How many times into the fray?

How many men won't walk away?

How many hells filled with

How many devils to pay?



One, two

Pick 'em up and put 'em down again

And watch the miles roll on

Three, four

Pick 'em up and put 'em down again

Until your strength is nearly gone

One, two

Pick 'em up and put 'em down again

And dream of home safe and sound

Three, four

Pick 'em up and put 'em down again

Until you're six feet underground

How many miles dead on our feet

Drenched to the bone, baked in the heat

Paying for ground with another retreat

How many times into the fray

How many men won't walk away

How many hells filled with

How many devils to pay?



Cut a man's throat, but don't look in his eyes

Cut till his body is still

Move to the next while the first bastard dies

Measuring life by the men that you kill

How many days, how many more?

How many men lost to this war?

I can't remember what we're fighting for

How many times into the fray?

How many men won't walk away?

How many hells filled with

How many devils to pay?
