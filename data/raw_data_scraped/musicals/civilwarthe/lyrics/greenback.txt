Greenback


Frederick Douglass

After a year of the most incompetent prosecution of any war effort in military history,

we have moved no closer to victory.

You, Mr. Lincoln, are fighting to restore a union, a union that we do not want.

It is diseased with prejudice and slavery.

And until you acknowledge this, the only ones who will be winning anything are the profiteers and theives!



Autolycus Fell

What's that smell I smell, Mabel?

Can you tell me what?



Mabel

Horse shit and blood flies



Autolycus Fell

You are right, my pussywillow

And where there's horse shit and blood flies

There's marching military

And where there's marching military, there's also the smell of greenback



Mabel

Green-what?



Autolycus Fell

M-O-N-E-double-Y, money! Gelt. Gold. Foldin' buyin' power.

Greenback.

Greenback...get you anything you need

Greenback...get you snow in July

Greenback...get you chicken fricasseed

Greenback...get you all you can buy

One man's "trouble" is another man's "meat"

When you got the goods it's the cat bird seat

One man's "holy" is another man's "sin"

Lose or win

Greenback gonna save your skin



Greenback, in a stack

Blackjack, sneak attack

Get it any way that you can

Lie, cheat, sugar sweet

Elite, Easy-street

Suckers are like gold in the pan

Johnny Reb, Billy Yank

Black, White, break the bank

Everybody's part of the plan

If it's blue or gray or it's in between

Pick 'em clean

Till the only color's green



Help! Help, help!



Mabel and Violet:

Help. Help, help.



Autolycus Fell

Allow me to introduce myself:

Mr. Autolycus Fell at your "here at last" service, gentlemen.

Boys, you look to be a good, honest intelligent set of men,

full of ...., who would gladly share their last their last biscuit or nickle with any fair lady of real...



Why, you best take advantage of my offer before your whole crowd gets here.

How many of you boys is there hereabouts, anyway?



Union Soldier

Two divisions



Autolycus Fell

Two divisions ain't too many for Mabel and Violet.

Now these ladies here is fresh from Madam Russell's bake oven in the great Tennessee city of Memphis.

Nashville.

They is free of all manner of veneral infection,

and have had but few opportunities for lewd associations.

So whichever of you is eager now for some horizontal refreshment,

can be assured of a good time generally I can tell you.

Boys...quality women like these don't go bad till later in life.

Greenback...makes the New York bankers go

Greenback...turns the cotton to wheat

Greenback...makes the Mississippi flow

Greenback...puts the shoes on your feet

One man's Yankee is a hooker girl's john

That she'll doodle-do 'til the money's gone

One man's rebel is a trader in gray

Either way, I'm the piper he's got to pay



Well, slam-bam thank you ma'am

Flimflam telegram

Get it any way that you can

Buy cheap, sell it steep

Clean sweep, pocket-deep

Suckers are like gold in the pan

Deathbed overhead

Hot lead in the red

Everybody's part of the plan

You can skin a cat if it's blue or gray

Hip-hooray

Greenback comin' either way



Captain Billy Pierce

How many?



Autolycus Fell

Two divisions. You're on their flank, and they don't know it.

Much obliged.



Blue or gray

Greenback comin' either way

Greenback comin' either way



Confederate Soldier

Do you think he's telling the truth?



Captain Billy Pierce

Go find out.
