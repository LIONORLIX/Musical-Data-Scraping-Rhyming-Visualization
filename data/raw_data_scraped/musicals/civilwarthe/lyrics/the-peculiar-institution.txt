The Enslaved

I remember the first time I witnessed

The hard terrible lash of the boss-man

On a back runnin' red

In the cool of the morning

In my sixteenth or seventeenth summer

How I cried when they sold off my brothers

To a house far away

Like a team of fast horses



How they jabbed and prodded and poked me

On the block of the docks in Savannah

They opened my mouth

For to reckon my value



I am summoned to pleasure the master

On those nights when the humor is on him

I bear him his sons

And he trades them for gold



And it feels more like dying than living

When somebody ain't free

And there's no one but Jesus forgiving

What they're doing to me



And they stole my son

From his bed one night

And they sold him South

'Cause the mistress decided he wasn't polite

And his eyes were disturbing

And my poor heart cries

But it comes and goes

Cause there's more good-byes

Than my body and soul and my broke heart knows

That I won't be forgetting



And it feels more like dying than living

When somebody ain't free



And the angels weep

And the winds complain

And the hurt goes deep

And the conscience of everyone tries to explain

When there's no explanation

And we're bought and sold

On the auction block

And the young grow old

In the chains that their father's would die to unlock

For their emancipation

And there's no one but Jesus forgiving

What they're doing to me



White women

Parasols, lawns of green

Summer all year long

Always there, seldom seen

They carry us along



The Enslaved

There must be an end!

To this long dark night

May the Lord God send

All his wrath down upon what he knows isn't right

To this valley of sorrow

Let the angels scream

Let the cold wind howl

Let the good men dream

Of the day when the devil of hate doesn't prowl

May that day be tomorrow

And it feels more like dying than living

How can God let this be

And there's no one but Jesus forgiving

What they're doing to me



I remember the old ones would tell me

'Bout a land that lay over the water

So far, far away

Where they said we had kingdoms

They said we had kingdoms
