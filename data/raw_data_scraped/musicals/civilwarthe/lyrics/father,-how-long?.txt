Father, How Long?


Clayton Toler

Tell me, my father, tell me how long

Will boys keep dyin' for freedom's song

Before we find a place to belong

Tell me, my father, how long?

Won't bow to no man, I got my pride

This dream I'm dreamin' can't be denied

How long till I can sing freedom's song?

Tell me, my father, how long?



I cry my tears

The same as any man you see

So God, please tell me why

This man ain't free

No more this darkness, bring me the light

Show me your mornin' cast off this night

How long till I can sing freedom's song?

Tell me my father,

Tell me my father

Tell me my father, how long?
