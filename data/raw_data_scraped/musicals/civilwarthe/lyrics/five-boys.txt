Five Boys


Mrs. Bixby

Five boys

Ever will they have each other

Brother ever there for brother

Safe at last and ever free



Five boys

Playing in a field with angels

When I close my eyes I see them waiting for me

In his grace I know that their souls will find shelter

Far away from all of the madness out there

My heart and I will share a mother's one last prayer



Five boys

Playing in field with angels

Running with the wind forever

Waiting for me
