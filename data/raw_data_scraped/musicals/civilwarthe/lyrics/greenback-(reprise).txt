Greenback (reprise)


Autolycus Fell

Greenback, you can't use it any way

Greenback, helps a body survive

Hot lead does the same to blue and grey

He's dead, brother I'm still alive

One man's treasure is another man's trash

You can die brave, while I count the cash

One man's hero, is another man's fool

Hey Captain

Much obliged



Violet

Greenback, gonna be the prize

Greenback, gonna save your skin

Quicker dead, now Violet's gettin' fed
