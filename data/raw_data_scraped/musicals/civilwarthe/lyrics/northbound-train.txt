Northbound Train


Captain Emmett Lochran

When all is said and done, I guess we're all the same

The words we speak, our hopes, and the God we claim

It's you and me, just a different name

Saw two men, one gray, and the other blue

Talkin' cross the picket lines the whole night through

Just swappin' lies, like two farm boys will do



They talked all night about the simple things

Like women, crops and the weather

The home-sick song that the south wind sings

And the whistle calls of the northbound train



Confederate Soldier

Yank! Hey Yank! You been shot?



Union Soldier

Nope. You?



Confederate Soldier

What?



Union Soldier

You got any holes in you?



Confederate Soldier

None 'cept those God made me with.



Used to be good apples in this country. You son-of-bitches ate 'em all.



Union Soldier

You hungry? I got some hard cracker if you want it.



Confederate Soldier

Throw it over.



Captain Emmett Lochran

They traded tales of the battles fought

Of how they felt and what they thought

Until they found they stood on common ground

But then the here and now came rushing back somehow

Reminding them of the deadly row

Like an angry blade that cuts against the grain



Mornin' broke and the spell was gone

But they were older and wiser

They said goodbye and they both moved on

Like the whistle call of a northbound train

Hear the whistle call of a northbound train



Confederate Soldier

You know somethin' Yank



Union Soldier

What's that?



Confederate Soldier

We could solve this war in 30 minutes if they left it to us.



Union Soldier

When you goin' home?



Confederate Soldier

I am home.



Captain Billy Pierce

Get up boy, we're movin' out



Confederate Soldier

Where we headin' Captain?



Captain Billy Pierce

We're goin' up against them. We're headin' North.
