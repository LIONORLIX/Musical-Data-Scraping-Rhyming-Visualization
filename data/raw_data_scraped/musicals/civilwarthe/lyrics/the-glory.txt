The Glory


Captain Emmett Lochran

The bugle calls us to the line

From the mists of the long ago

See how the battle sabres shine

And the shadows the flags all throw

For the glory

For a land forever free

For the last best hope of mankind

For the better part of me

For the glory

For the words we hold so dear

Let us give the last full measure

Gathered here

For the glory



Frederick Douglass

Our time to stand has come at last

Let the drums start the long long roll



Black Soldier

The chains are gone, the die is cast

To His grace I commend my soul



Captain Emmett Lochran

For the glory

For the country we could be

For the freedom we must cherish

If we die, let us die free



All

For the glory

For the truth we hold so dear

Let us give the last full measure

Gathered here

Captain Billy Pierce

For the glory



Frederick Douglass

The surrender of the Confederacy, the president's second inaugaration, and his funeral have all happened in little more than a month.

Six hundred and twenty thousand Americans have lost their lives.

On the issue of slavery, Mr. Lincoln seemed slow, cold and indifferent.

But, given the sentiments of the country, he was swift, radical and determined.

Taking him all in all, I know now that infinite wisdom has seldom sent any man into the world better fitted for his mission than Abraham Lincoln.

I was at his inaugaration, and I remember his words.

Fondly do we hope -- fervently do we pray -- that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away.



Voice of Abraham Lincoln

With malice toward none

With charity for all

With firmness in the right, as God gives us to see the right

Let us strive on to finish the work we are in

To bind up the nation's wounds



All

For the glory

For the men of blue and gray

Make the country that they died for

Worth the price they had to pay

For the glory

Let the voice of freedom grow

'Til we finish what they started, long ago



For the glory

For the men of blue and gray

Make the country that they died for

Worth the price they had to pay

For the glory

Let the voice of freedom grow

'Til we finish what they started, long ago

For the Glory
