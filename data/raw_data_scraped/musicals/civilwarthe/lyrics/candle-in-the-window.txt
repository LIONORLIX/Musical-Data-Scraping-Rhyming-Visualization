Candle in the Window


Harriet Jackson

First door on the right

In a lonely window

Shines a solitary light

Burning in the window

Near a figure in a chair

Always sitting there

Quiet as a prayer



Does he close his eyes?

Weary with the weight of being

Suddenly so wise

Tired of the demons

He must sit up there and fight

Deep into the night

Praying that he's right?



Every evening I can see his shadow on the shade

And I don't feel so alone or so afraid

There's a candle in the window every night

Reflecting all our hopes and dreams

Or so it seems to me as I look up to see

That candle in the window every night

Burning like the yearning to be free

Far away and dim

Kept alive by him



Frederick Douglass

Politicians.



Harriet Jackson

First door on the right

Shines the promise of his light
