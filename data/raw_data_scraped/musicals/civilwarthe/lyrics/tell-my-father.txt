Tell My Father


Private Sam Taylor

Tell my father that his son

Didn't run or surrender

That I bore his name with pride

As I tried to remember

You are judged by what you do

While passing through



As I rest 'neath fields of green

Let him lean on your shoulder

Tell him how I spent my youth

So the truth could grow older

Tell my father, when you can

I died a man



Tell him we will meet again

Where the angels learn to fly

Tell him we will meet as men

For with honour did I die



Tell him I fought the blue

Proud and true, through the fire

Tell my father so he'll know

I love him so



Tell him how I wore the gray

Just the way that he taught me

Tell my father not to cry

Then say goodbye
