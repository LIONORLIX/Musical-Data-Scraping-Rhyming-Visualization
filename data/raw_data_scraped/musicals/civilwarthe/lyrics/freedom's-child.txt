Freedom's Child


Frederick Douglass



Look at these hands

I stole them from my master

Look through these eyes

Imagine what they've seen

The cold, dark night

Must now come to an end

A holy light

Is just around the bend

Today we fight

For all the ground in between

The words we say and what we really mean

So let the bells of freedom ring

Let the dogs of war run wild

From out the age of darkness bring

The birth of freedom's child



Look at these words:

"To God all men are equal"

Write them again

In letters black and strong

Till all are free

We'll all live as a slave

We all must be

The land born to the brave

Till you and me

Can find a place to belong

Where we believe what isn't right must be wrong

So throw my brother's chains away

No more to be exiled

And get down on your knees and pray

We'll all be freedom's child



All of those years

Standing outside

Knocking on heaven's door

All of those tears

All of us crying

Give us our freedom

Nothing less, nothing more!

Where slavery is, there liberty cannot be

Freedom!

Where liberty is, there slavery cannot be

Freedom!

If this institution of slavery is to be removed from this land

Freedom!

We must remove it!



So throw my brother's chains away

Freedom!

No more to be exiled

Freedom!

And get down on your knees and pray

Freedom!

We'll all be freedom's child!

So let the bells of freedom ring

Freedom!

Let the dogs of war run wild

Freedom!

From out the age of darkness bring

Freedom!

The birth of freedom's child



So throw my brother's chains away

Freedom!

No more to be exiled

Freedom!

And get down on your knees and pray

Freedom!

We'll all be freedom's child!
