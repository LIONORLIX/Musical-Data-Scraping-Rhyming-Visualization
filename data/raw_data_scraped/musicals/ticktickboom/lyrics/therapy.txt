SUSAN:

Are you saying we can't talk?



JONATHAN:

Are you saying we are not talking?



SUSAN:

What are you saying?



JONATHAN:

What are you saying?

I'm saying:



I feel bad, that you feel bad

About me feeling bad, about you feeling bad

About what I said, about what you said

About me not being able to share a feeling



SUSAN:

If I thought that what you thought

Was that I hadn't thought about sharing my thoughts

Then my reaction to your reaction

To my reaction

Would have been more revealing



JONATHAN:

I was afraid that you'd be afraid

If I told you that I was afraid of intimacy



If you don't have a problem with my problem

Maybe the problem is simply co-dependency



SUSAN:

Yes I know that now you know

That I didn't know that you didn't know

That when I said "No"

I meant "Yes, I know"

And that now I know that you knew

That you knew you adored me



JONATHAN:

I was wrong to



SUSAN:

Say you were wrong to



JONATHAN:

Say I was wrong about



SUSAN:

You being wrong



JONATHAN:

When you rang to say that



SUSAN:

The ring was the wrong thing to bring



JONATHAN:

If I meant what I said

When I said "rings bore me"



JONATHAN AND SUSAN:

I'm not mad that you got mad that I got mad

When you said I should go drop dead



JONATHAN:

If I were you and I'd done what I'd done

I'd do what you did when I gave you the ring

Having said what I said



JONATHAN:

I feel bad, that you feel bad

About me feeling bad, about you feeling bad

About what I said, about what you said

About me not being able to share a feeling



I thought you thought I reacted shallowly

When I reacted to you



I'm not mad

You got mad

Go drop dead



If I were you and I'd done what I'd done

I'd do what you did when I gave you the ring

Having said what I said



SUSAN:

I feel badly about you

Feeling badly about me

Feel badly about you



If I thought that what you thought

Was that I hadn't thought about sharing my thoughts

Then my reaction to your reaction

To my reaction

Would have been more revealing



I'm not mad that you got mad that I got mad

When you said I should go drop dead



If I were you

But I'm not you

Said what I said



JONATHAN:

But now it's out in the open



SUSAN:

Now it's off our chest



JONATHAN AND SUSAN:

Now it's four am

And we have therapy tomorrow

It's too late to screw

So lets just get some rest
