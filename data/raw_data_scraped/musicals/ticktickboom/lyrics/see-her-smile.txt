See Her Smile


JONATHAN:

It's not you, she says

It's just that life's so hard

We all get blue, I say

Hang on tight

I'll be your bodyguard



Something's breakin' my baby's heart

Something's breakin' my baby's heart

Something's breakin' my baby's heart

Oh, oh, I just wanna see her smile



It's such a drag, she says

When the world's so mean

It's just a red flag, I say

Gotta look for the green



Oh, oh, oh

Something's breakin' my baby's heart

Something's breakin' my baby's heart

Something's breakin' my baby's heart

Oh, oh, I just wanna see her smile



Cynical town can be tough on an angel



JONATHAN and MICHAEL

Clip her wings baby, one, two, three



JONATHAN

I'm her clown cause a



JONATHAN and MICHAEL

Laughin' angels richer than kings



JONATHAN

Oh, baby, don't you see?

Baby, don't you agree?



Wish I knew why, she says

But on a sunny day, I find the rain

Let's give it a try, I say

We can dance all through the pain



Something's breakin' my baby's heart

Something's breakin' my baby's heart

Something's breakin' my baby's heart



Oh, oh

Oh,oh

Oh,oh

Ooooh, oh, oh

I just wanna see her smile

I just wanna see her smile

I just wanna see her smile

I just wanna see her

Just wanna see her...smile
