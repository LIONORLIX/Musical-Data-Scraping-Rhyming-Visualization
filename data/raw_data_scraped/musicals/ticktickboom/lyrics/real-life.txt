Real Life


MICHAEL:

Sunlight

Through the window

Across from your bed

Beauty is still

Can you see it?

What more can you want?



Is this real life?

Is this real life?



Heartbeats

Of your children

Asleep in the next room

Trust so still

Can you hear it?

What more can you want?



Is this real life?

Is this real life?



MICHAEL AND JONATHAN:

Why do we seek out ecstasy

In all the wrong places?

Why is it hard to see

That heaven can have simpler faces?



MICHAEL:

Warm breath

Of an angel



MICHAEL AND SUSAN:

Awake next to you

Love's so still

Can you feel it?

What more do you want?



MICHAEL, JONATHAN AND SUSAN:

Is this real life?

Real life

Is this real life?

Is this real...

Is this real life?

Is this real life?

Real life

Is this real life?

Is this real...

Is this real...

Is this...



MICHAEL

Is this real life?
