Sugar


JONATHAN:

She can be white

She can be brown

She's always easy

Goin' down, goin' down



She don't care - What I look like

Or how I dress

She never says, "no"

Always says, "yes"



Oh, oh, oh

Sugar, she's refined

For a small price

She blows my mind



Sugar, she's got the power

Soothes my soul for half an hour

Half an hour, half an hour, half an hour



KARESSA

Twinkies, oh my God, I love them!



She's my honey

She's my tart

I'm her cream puff

She's my sweetheart



JONATHAN:

Knocks me out

And strips me bare

Sugar, sugar, sugar

I won't care



COUNTER GUY:

Late at night



COUNTER GUY and KARESSA:

When I'm sad and lonely

One thing only

Cures by blues



JONATHAN AND COUNTER GUY:

Stressed out



KARESSA:

Burned out



ALL:

Hangin' by a string

Sugar, sugar, sugar

I won't feel a thing

Sugar so sweet



JONATHAN:

Sugar, sugar, sugar

You got me

Kissing your feet



ALL

Kissing your feet

Pretty baby



JONATHAN

She don't care



ALL

What I look like



JONATHAN

Or how I dress



KARESSA AND COUNTER GUY:

She don't care



ALL

No, no, no, no, no, no



JONATHAN:

The only thing I know

Is that she makes

My life such a mess



KARESSA and COUNTER GUY:

Oh, yes



JONATHAN:

Sugar, oh yeah



KARESSA and COUNTER GUY:

Sugar, sugar, oh yeah



JONATHAN:

Sugar, oh yeah, yeah, yeah



KARESSA and COUNTER GUY:

Sugar, sugar



ALL

Sugar, oh yeah

Sugar, oh yeah

S-U-G-A-R

Ooooh! Yeah!
