Louder Than Words


JONATHAN

Why do we play with fire?

Why do we run our finger through the flame?

Why do we leave our hand on the stove,

Although we know, we're in for some pain?



Oh, why do we refuse to hang a light,

When the streets are dangerous?

Why does it take an accident,

Before the truth gets through to us?



Cages or wings,

Which do you prefer?

Ask the birds



Fear or love, baby

Don't say the answer

Actions speak louder than words



Why should we try to be our best

When we can just get by and still gain?

Why do we nod our heads



MICHAEL and JONATHAN

Although we know



MICHAEL

The boss is wrong as rain?



JONATHAN

Why should we blaze a trail

When the well worn path Seems safe and



JONATHAN and SUSAN

So inviting?



SUSAN

How, as we travel, can we



JONATHAN and SUSAN

See the dismay

And keep from fighting?



JONATHAN MICHAEL AND SUSAN

Cages or wings, Cages or wings,

Which do you prefer?

Ask the birds Ah:



ALL

Fear or love, baby

Don't say the answer



JONATHAN MICHAEL AND SUSAN



Actions speak louder than Louder than, louder than:

Words



What does it take

To wake up a generation?



ALL

How can you make someone

Take off and fly?



JONATHAN

If we don't wake up

And shake up the nation

We'll eat the dust

Of the world wondering why



SUSAN

Why do we stay with lovers



SUSAN and JONATHAN

Who we know, down deep



SUSAN

Just aren't right?



JONATHAN

Why would we rather



ALL

Put ourselves through hell

Than sleep alone at night?



JONATHAN

Why do we follow leaders who never lead?



MICHAEL

Why does it take catastrophe to start a revolution



MICHAEL and SUSAN

If we're so free?

Tell me why



JONATHAN

Someone tell me why

So many people bleed



JONATHAN MICHAEL AND SUSAN

Cages or wings, Cages or wings,

Which do you prefer?

Ask the birds Ah:



ALL

Fear or love, baby

Don't say the answer



JONATHAN MICHAEL AND SUSAN

Actions speak louder than Louder than, Louder than,

Louder than, Louder than



ALL

Cages or wings,

Which do you prefer?



JONATHAN MICHAEL AND SUSAN

Ask the birds Ah:



ALL

Fear or love, baby

Don't say the answer



JONATHAN MICHAEL AND SUSAN

Actions speak louder Louder than, Louder than

They speak louder Louder than, Louder than

Actions speak louder than words!
