Why


JONATHAN

When I was nine,

Michael and I

Entered a talent show down at the Y



Nine A.M. went to rehearse by some stairs

Mike couldn't sing

But I said, "No one cares"



We sang "Yellow Bird" and "Let's Go Fly A Kite"

Over and over and over

Till we got it right



When we emerged from the YMCA

Three o'clock sun had made the grass hay



I thought,

Hey, what a way to spend a day

Hey, what a way to spend a day

I make a vow, right here and now

I'm gonna spend my time this way



When I was sixteen,

Michael and I

Got parts in "West Side"

At White Plains High



Three o'clock went to rehearse in the gym

Mike played "Doc", who didn't sing

Fine with him



We sang, "gotta rocket in your pocket"

and "the Jets are gonna have their day - tonight"

Over and over and over

Till we got it right



When we emerged,

Wiped out by that play

Nine o'clock, stars and moon lit the way



I thought,

Hey, what a way to spend a day

Hey, what a way to spend a day

I made a vow

I wonder now

Am I cut out to spend my time this way?



With only so much time to spend

Don't wanna waste the time I'm given

"Have it all, play the game" - some recommend

I'm afraid, it just may be time to give in



I'm twenty-nine,

Michael and I

Live on the west side of SoHo, N.Y.



Nine A.M.

I write a lyric or two

Mike sings his song now on Mad Avenue



I sing, "Come to your senses

Defenses are not the way to go"

Over and over and over

Till I got it right



When I emerge from B Minor or A

Five o'clock, diner calls, "I'm on my way"



I think,

Hey, what a way to spend a day

Hey, what a way to spend a day

I make a vow - right here and now

I'm gonna spend my time this way

I'm gonna spend my time this way
