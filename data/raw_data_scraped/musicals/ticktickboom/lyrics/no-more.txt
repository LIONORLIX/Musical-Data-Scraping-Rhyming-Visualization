No More


MICHAEL:

No more

Walking up six flights of stairs

Or throwing down the key

Because there is no buzzer.



No more

Walking thirteen blocks

With thirty pounds of laundry

In the fuckin' dead of winter



No more faulty wiring

No more painted floors

No more spitting out my Ultra Brite

On top of dirty dishes

In the one and only sink



Hello, to my walk in closets

Tidy as Park Avenue

Hello, my butcher block table



I could get used - I could get used

I could get used to you



No more

Climbing over sleeping people

Before you get out the door of your own building



MICHAEL AND JONATHAN:

No more



MICHAEL:

Noxious fumes from gas heaters that are illegal



JONATHAN:

Or will blow up while you are sleeping



MICHAEL AND JONATHAN:

Ohhhh!



MICHAEL:

No more



JONATHAN:

Leaky ceilings



MICHAEL:

No more



JONATHAN:

Holes in the floor



MICHAEL AND JUNATHAN:

No more



JONATHAN:

Taking a shower in the kitchen

While your roommate's eating breakfast



MICHAEL AND JONATHAN:

And you are getting water on his corn flakes



Hello, to shiny new parquet wood floors

As waxed as a wealthy girl's legs

Hello, dear Mister Dishwasher



MICHAEL:

I could get used



JONATHAN:

I could get used



MICHAEL:

I could get used to you



JONATHAN:

I could get used to you



MICHAEL AND JONATHAN:

I could get used to you



JONATHAN:

No more, exotic



MICHAEL:

No more, neurotic



MICHAEL AND JONATHAN:

No more anything

But pleasantly robotic



MICHAEL:

We are moving on up



JONATHAN:

We are moving on up



MICHAEL:

To the East Side



JONATHAN:

To the East Side



MICHAEL AND JONATHAN:

To a deluxe apartment

In the sky



JONATHAN:

What's that?



MICHAEL:

Oh, come on

Hold on, breathe



JONATHAN:

Uhhhh!



MICHAEL:

Easy



JONATHAN:

What are you doing?



MICHAEL:

It's him

Ah, hold the phone



MICHAEL AND JONATHAN:

Hello, to dear Mister Doorman

Who looks like Captain Kangaroo

Hello dear fellow, and how do you do?



JONATHAN:

I could get used



MICHAEL:

I could get used



JOHATHAN:

Even seduced



MICHAEL:

Even seduced



MICHAEL AND JONATHAN:

I could get used to you

Ooow!

Oh, yeah!
