Together


Starr:



Sometimes this life can seem too much



Langston:



Yeah



Starr:



Sometimes I feel like giving up



Britney:



And when I dont know how to find my strengh

Your right there taking hold of me sayin...



All:



Together

We can take on the world

Oh Yea

Together

We can do anything

If we just believe

Together

You and Me



Marcie:



I'll be the one to take your hand

Whenever you are down



All:



We'll always be your biggest fan

And dont you ever doubt that



In times of laughter

times of tears

You just reach out, and I'll be here



Marcie:



Together we can do anything



All:



Together we can do anything If we just believe



We can take on the rain

We can survive the pain

We can be everything that we need to each other

Together we can do anything



Together

We can take on the world

Together

We can do anything If we just believe

Together

You and Me
