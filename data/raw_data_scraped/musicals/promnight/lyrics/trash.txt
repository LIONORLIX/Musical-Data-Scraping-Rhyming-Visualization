Britney:



There is a fine line

that you crossed for the last time

Invaded my space

you stole what was mine

never my friend

you took the wrong side



There is a boundary

that obviously you dont see

your a witch and that spells

get away from me

you put the m in misery



All is fair in love and war

but girl

this time youve gone way to far

it's war



Youre trash

you dont deserve to have any true feelings

Trash

sorry mean it but your life has no meaning

your worthless

im nerving

absolutely so self serving

Trash



Your not one of my favorite people



Your like an ugly and evil step-sister

twisting evr mr. into diaster

covering it up with laughter



Your like afraid of your finest one

you just treat guys like a desperate tyrant

but you dont have the heart

you cant



you wont talk me into thinking

what you did was right

your gonna be sorry and big trouble now

your in my sight

So its war



Your trash

you dont deserve to have any true feelings

Trash

sorry to mean it but your life has no meaning

Trash

Your worhtless

I'm nerving

absolutely so self serving

Trash



It's sad to think that people like you exsist

so sad

but if you disappear you never would be missed

lalala

the gloves are off the time has come

you ruined my night

it over now,the time has come you lose this fight

I still

I still

I still

dont like you



Your trash

you dont deserve to have any true feelings

Trash

sorry to mean it but your life has no meaning

Trash

Your worhtless

I'm nerving

absolutely so self serving

Trash



You know I never liked you
