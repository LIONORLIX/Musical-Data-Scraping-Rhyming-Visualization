Come With Me


Starr:

You might just be the boy Ive always known

I might be lost in something beautiful

Cole:

We might have found a secret deep inside ourselves

Deeper than this moment here tonight

Starr and Cole:

(Chorus)

In our song

we become one

You and I run from the boundaries of time

Come with me

With Melody

Is a life and waking our hearts in the dawning of new light

Markko:

You might be everything Ive dreamed of

Langston:

I might just find myself in your soul

Britney

I can tell you that Ill always fight for what we have

All:

Baby, take my hand and hold on

(Chorus)

Like a mystery we found very deep

Waiting to be unlocked, to be unleashed

This is how I will always love you, (I'll always love you)

(Chorus)

Is a life and waking our hearts in the dawing of new life
