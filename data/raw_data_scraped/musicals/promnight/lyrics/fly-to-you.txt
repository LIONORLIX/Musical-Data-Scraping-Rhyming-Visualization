Fly To You


Starr:

I put so much

Into this little dream I had



I'd swear you

I could almost taste and touch

Peace at last



But if you taught me anything

It was how to let things I love so go



You said through all this whatever becomes of me

I'll fly to you

With love, and no regrets

Whatever becomes of me I fly to you

In this world of subtlety and envy

there was a time for you and me



Like summer song

Like theres nothing wrong

I fly to you



Cole:

My remembrance of you

Seems so real

I could live in it



But it seems so long

Since I came to you

Searchin for a friend



But when your voice spoke to me



Cole & Starr: Its whisper was some how different



Now you say through all this

Whatever becomes of me I fly to you

With Love, and no regrets

Whatever becomes of me I fly to you



In this world of subtlety and envy

there was a time for you and me

Like a summersong

Like theres nothing wrong

I fly to you
