Cheerleaders A Bitch


Britney:



Cheerleaders in Hollywood

Their the favorite villians

on the big and small screen



They torment all the nice who are sqeaky clean

The Ouarterback the king to their

Homecoming Drama Queen



Squad:

Britney:



The cheerleader always the bitch on tv

They make it look like it's all so easy

Their always the blondest and richer than rich

Always have it all, but they dont work for it

That's what makes the cheerleader a bitch



Britney: It's not right

Squad: It's not right



Britney: It's not so

Squad: It not so



Britney/Squad:



As a cheerleader I live by one moto



Britney:



With poms-poms come great responsibility

So on the day of the big game

cheer your boys to victory



I'm a really nice girl if you give me a chance

Swear it's not the power I just love to dacne

And it not my fault that I can do great spilts

both of my parents are contortionist



Guess that why the cheerleaders a bitch



Squad: Keeping everything in balance

Britney: Dont drop me please

Squad: It's a very hard routune

Britney: Youre so clumsy



Britney:



High School is a pyramid

and it take alot of talent

to do it for the team



All I want is to live a normal life

Grow to be pretty and a trophy wife

I want the best car and best purse and nails

to never buy a single thing on sale



That's what make the cheerleader a bitch



Squad: It's not right

Britney: It's not right

Squad: It's not so

Britney: It's not so

Britney/Squad:



As a cheerleader I live by one moto



Britney:



With poms-poms come great responsibility

So on the day of the big game

cheer your boys to victory
