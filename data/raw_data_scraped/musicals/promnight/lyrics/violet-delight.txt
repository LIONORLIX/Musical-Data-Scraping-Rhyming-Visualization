Violet Delight


Don?t act like that

Don?t shut me out

Like I?m a stranger and she?s not

You?re all I dream Violet Delight

You wake me in the night



It?s rare that I should care this much

It scares me how I need your touch

Now I understand that

You can live with all I am



Don?t wake me up

All we?ve been through

Imperfect girl whose right for you

I want it all I want the pain

When you are gone it rains



It?s rare that I should care this much

It scares me how I need your touch

Now I understand that

You can live with all I am



My heart is breaking

I?m deaf in sound sleep



It?s rare that I should care this much

It scares me how I need your touch

Now I understand that

You can live with all I



My heart is breaking

I?m deaf in sound sleep
