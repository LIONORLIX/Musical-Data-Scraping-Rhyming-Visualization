Violet Delight (Reprise)


Don?t act like that

Don?t shout me out

Like I?m a stranger and she?s not

You?re all I dream Violet Delight

You wake me in the night



It?s rare that I should care this much

It stupid how I need your touch

Now I understand that

You can live with all I, live with all I, live with all I am
