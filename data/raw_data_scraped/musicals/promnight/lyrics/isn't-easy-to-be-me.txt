Isn't Easy To Be Me


Starr:



Oh I wish that all my wishin stop

and that the wishin would just come true

Cause when I finally find my mind deep inside

I know its right



Tell me does it feel the same way for you



Cause It drives me insane

tryin to care about

what other people are thinking

tryin to please everyone but me



I can take much more



Starr/Chorous:



It isnt easy

to sit back, watch from the sidelines

It isnt easy

to hide all my feelings inside

Wonderin if I've done the right thing

Or wrecked up my life

It isnt easy to be me

Sometimes



Britney:



Tell me how you know, when you think you know

That you've reached the point

Your finally trying to hard



It's that point when youre gonna sacrifice

who you really are

and you get lost, caught up and talk



Langston:



Why do I feel it's always me

the ones whos different

why am I outside of the tracks

theres got to be more



All/Chorous



All:

So I'll run fast

turn left

then I'll run some more



I've got to save

my heart

from its hurt before

and I wont stop

till I am sure



Thatthat you be hurting

I'm not of your age

no possibility

that you'll be hurting me

No more



Britney:



It isnt easy to smile

when I'm just feelin down



Langston:



Or to say what feel

around everyone else



Starr:



Wanna throw out the rules

but I still compromise



It isnt easy to be sometimes



Oh how I wish that all my wishin would STOP!
