Come With Me (Reprise)


You might just be the boy I've always known

I might be lost in something beautiful

We might have found a secret deep inside ourselves

Deeper than this moment here tonight



In a song

we become one

you and I

right from the boundaries of time

Come with me where the melody is alive

and wakeing our hearts to

is alive and wakeing our hearts to

the dawning of new light
