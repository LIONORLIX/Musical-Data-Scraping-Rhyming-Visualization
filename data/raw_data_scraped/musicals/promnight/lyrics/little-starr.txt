Little Starr


It's a light full of dreams

and wishes do come true

theirs a sky full of stars

but only one like you



it takes years

it takes time

for the light to reach the earth and shine

look at you here you are

burning brihgt my little Starr



there've been times along the way

where the distance seemed to pull are worlds apart

but on that day you were born

god hung a new star in my heart



it takes years

it takes time

for the light to reach the earth and shine

look at you here you are

burning bright my little Starr



so let your light dance

like the colors of the rainbow

and the rising sun

and let me take this chance

to say I'm proud of the woman that you've become

so I wish with all my might

all your dreams come true tonight
