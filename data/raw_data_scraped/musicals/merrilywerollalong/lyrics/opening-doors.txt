Opening Doors


(Frank is working at the piano, Charley at a typewriter.)



FRANK

How's it going?



CHARLEY

Good. You?



FRANK

Fair.



CHARLEY

Yeah, tell me.



FRANK

(answering phone)

Chinese laundry.



MARY

(also at a typewriter, into phone)

Hi.

CHARLEY

Say hello.



MARY

I think I got a job.



FRANK

Where?



MARY

FRANK

MARY

Thank you. Writing captions.



FRANK

What about the book?



MARY

What about the book?



FRANK

Nothing, are you working on your book?



MARY

Yes ?



FRANK

Good.



MARY

No ?



FRANK

Mary ?



MARY

Right, I know, yes, me and Balzac ?



(She hangs up. They all resume work.)



CHARLEY

I finished the one-act.



FRANK

I got an audition ?



MARY

I started the story.



FRANK

? Rehearsal pianist.



CHARLEY

So where are we eating?



MARY

I'm moving to Playboy.



FRANK

The publisher called me.



CHARLEY

I'm doing a rewrite.



MARY

My parents are coming.



FRANK

I saw My Fair Lady.



CHARLEY

I rewrote the rewrite.



FRANK

I sort of enjoyed it.



MARY

I threw out the story.



CHARLEY

I'm meeting an agent.



ALL

We'll all get together on Sunday.



We're opening doors,

Singing, "Here we are!"

We're filling up days

On a dime.

That faraway shore's

Looking not too far.

We're following every star ?

There's not enough time!



(They pursue their jobs.)



FRANK

I called a producer.



CHARLEY

I sent off the one-act.



MARY

I started the story.



FRANK

He said to come see him.



CHARLEY

I dropped out of college.



MARY

I met this musician.



FRANK

I'm playing a nightclub.



CHARLEY

They're doing my one-act!



MARY

I'm working for Redbook.



FRANK

I rewrote the ballad.



MARY

I finished the story.



CHARLEY

We started rehearsals.



MARY

I threw out the story

And then the musician.

I'm moving to Popular Science.



ALL

We're opening doors,

Singing, "Look who's here!"

Beginning to sail

On a dime.

That faraway shore's

Getting very near!

We haven't a thing to fear,

We haven't got time!



(They go back to work intensely.)



FRANK

How's it coming?



CHARLEY

Good. You?



FRANK

Done.



CHARLEY

One minute ?



FRANK

(answering phone)

Hamburg Heaven.



MARY

(into phone)

Hi.



FRANK

Mary ?



CHARLEY

Say hello.



MARY

I got another job.



FRANK

Where?



MARY

Chic.



FRANK

What's that?



MARY

A brand-new concept:

Pop-up pictures.



FRANK

What about the book?



MARY

What about the book?



FRANK

Did you give the publisher the book?



MARY

Yes ?



FRANK

Good.



MARY

No ?



FRANK

Mary ?



MARY

Look, I ?



CHARLEY

(ripping the paper out of the typewriter)

Finished!



FRANK

Let me call you back.



MARY

(hanging up)

Right.



CHARLEY

This is just a draft.



FRANK

Right.



CHARLEY

I haven't had the time to do a polish ?



FRANK

Will you sing!!



CHARLEY

Right.

(reading from his lyrics)

"Who wants to live in New York?

Who wants the worry, the noise, the dirt, the heat?

Who wants the garbage cans clanging in the street?

Suddenly I do.

(They are now auditioning for Joe Josephson.)

They're always popping the cork ? "

I hate that line ?

"The cops, the cabbies, the salesgirls up at Saks,

You gotta have a real taste for maniacs ?

Suddenly I do!"



JOE

That's great. That's swell.

The other stuff as well.

It isn't every day

I hear a score this strong

But fellas, if I may,

There's only one thing wrong:



There's not a tune you can hum.

There's not a tune you go bum-bum-bum-di-dum.

You need a tune you can bum-bum-bum-di-dum ?

Give me a melody!



Why can't you throw 'em a crumb?

What's wrong with letting 'em tap their toes a bit?

I'll let you know when Stravinsky has a hit ?

Give me some melody!



Oh sure, I know,

It's not that kind of show.

But can't you have a score

That's sort of in between?

Look, play a little more,

I'll show you what I mean ?



CHARLEY

"Who wants to live in New York?

I always hated the dirt, the heat, the noise.

But ever since I met you, I ? "



JOE

Listen, boys,

Maybe it's me,

But that's just not a hummmmmmmmmmmmmable melody!

(as he leaves)

Write more, work hard ?

Leave your name with the girl.

Less avant-garde ?

Leave your name with the girl.

Just write a plain old melodee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee ?

Dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee ?



CHARLEY

They're stopping rehearsals.

They ran out of money ?



MARY

We lasted one issue.

My book was rejected ?



FRANK

The nightclub was raided.

I have to start coaching ?



MARY

My parents are coming.



CHARLEY

They screwed up the laundry.



FRANK

My wallet was stolen.



MARY

I saw the musician.



CHARLEY

We're being evicted.



MARY

I'm having a breakdown.



ALL

We'll all get together on Sunday.



They're slamming doors,

Singing, "Go away!"

It's less of a sail

Than a climb.

That faraway shore's

Farther every day.

We're learning to ricochet ?

We still have a lot to say ?



FRANK

You know what we'll do?



CHARLEY

What?



FRANK

We'll do a revue.



CHARLEY

What?



MARY

What?



FRANK

We'll do a revue of our own!



MARY

What?



CHARLEY

Where?



MARY

Why?



CHARLEY

When?



FRANK

Not just songs, but stories, scenes,

Piano pieces, mime ?



CHARLEY

Yeah!



MARY

Frankly Frank ?



FRANK

A showcase of our own?



CHARLEY

Where?



FRANK

The club's reopening.



MARY

We'll write a lot of new stuff ?



CHARLEY

Rewrite the old stuff ?



FRANK

What about the girl?



CHARLEY

What about the girl?



FRANK

Only that we're gonna need a girl.



CHARLEY

Well, Mary ?



MARY

Thanks, I don't perform except at dinner.



(A girl auditions for them.)



GIRL AUDITIONING

"Who wants to live in New York?

Who wants the worry, the noise, the dirt, the heat?

Who wants the garbage cans clanging in the street ? ?"



FRANK

Thank you for coming.

(A second girl ? Beth ? steps up.)

Next eight, please.



BETH

"They're always popping their cork ? "



FRANK

(to Ted)

Up a tone.



BETH

" ? The cops, the cabbies, the salesgirls up at Saks ? "



FRANK

Up a tone.



BETH

" ? You gotta have a real taste for maniacs ? "



FRANK

Thank you. You're hired.



BETH

I'm Beth.



FRANK

I'm Frank.



BETH

I really thought I stank.



MARY

I'm Mary.



CHARLEY

Charley.



FRANK

By the way,

I'm told we open Saturday ?



THE OTHERS

What!



MARY

You're not serious!



CHARLEY

Nobody's ready!



FRANK

Apparently someone cancelled a booking.



CHARLEY

The songs aren't finsihed ?



MARY

And what about costumes?



BETH

And how do I learn all these numbers?



FRANK

I'll bring you the copies of everything later this evening.



| BETH

| Okay, but I'll have to have all the music, and

| Saturday I've got to sing at a wedding. Oh,

| God, is there dancing, 'cause I'm not a dancer ?

|

| CHARLEY

| Not to mention I still haven't finished the

| Synanon song or the Kennedy number ?

|

| FRANK

| You don't have to, we'll segue the

| End of it into the dance we cut out ?



| CHARLEY

| ? And what'll we do about getting publicity,

| Run around town putting stickers on windows ? ?

|

| MARY

| And have we decided or not on the restaurant sketch?

| I need two or three days to replace it ?

|

| FRANK

| No, we'll use it but not with the long introduction ?



ALL

We'll worry about it on Sunday!



We're opening doors, singing, "Here we are!"

We're filling up days on a dime.

That faraway shore's looking not too far.

We're following every star ?

There's not enough time!



We're banging on doors, shouting, "Here again!"

We're risking it all on a dime.

That faraway shore's looking near again,

The only thing left is when,

We know we should count to ten ?

We haven't got time!

We haven't got time!
