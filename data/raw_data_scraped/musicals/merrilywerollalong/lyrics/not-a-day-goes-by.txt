Not a Day Goes By


Not a Day Goes By

FRANK

Not a day goes by,

Not a single day

But you're somewhere a part of my life

And it looks like you'll stay.



As the days go by,

I keep thinking, "When does it end?

Where's the day I'll have started forgetting?"

But I just go on

Thinking and sweating

And cursing and crying

And turning and reaching

And waking and dying

And no,

Not a day goes by,

Not a blessed day

But you're still somehow part of my life

And you won't go away.



So there's hell to pay

And until I die,

I'll die day after day

After day after day

After day after day

After day

Till the days go by,

Till the days go by,

Till the days go by!
