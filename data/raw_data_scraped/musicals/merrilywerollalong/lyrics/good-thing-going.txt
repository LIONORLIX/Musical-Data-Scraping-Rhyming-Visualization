ANOTHER BOY

TIme goes by

And dreams go by,



BOTH BOYS

Your dream.



TERRY

Tend your BOYS

Dream. Some roads are easy.

Dreams take

Time. Some roads are all uphill.

Time goes

By. Some roads you plod along

With a will.

Some roads you travel just

For the thrill.

Bend your

Dream. Some rides are breezy.

With the

Road. Some roads are full of

Jiggles and bumps.

Can't let it get you

Down in the dumps.

Don't let it Don't let it

Get you Get you

Down in the Down in the

Dumps! Dumps!

Some roads are easy ?

Some rides are breezy ?

Always roll ?

Some roads are all uphill,

Everybody roll ? Some roads are full of

Bumps ?

Know what you want to do,

Where you're willing to go,

Keep an eye on your dream What you really want to see

While you're travelling! While you're travelling!

GUSSIE

(banging on the piano)

All right, now quiet, everybody, please. Fermez all those bouches, because some day you're going to be able to say, "I was

there when." The most exciting composer ever is going to play a song we hope is going to be in our new show, and when he

finishes playing you are all going to want to swallow poison because there will be nothing more to live for.



CHARLEY

Frank, what is she talking about?



FRANK

Later, Charley.



(Frank plays the piano.)



CHARLEY

It started out like a song.

We started quiet and slow,

With no surprise.

And then one morning I woke

To realize

We had a good thing going.



It's not that nothing went wrong:

Some angry moments, of course,

But just a few,

And only moments, no more,

Because we knew

We had this good thing going.



And if I wanted too much,

Was that such

A mistake

At the time?

You never wanted enough ?

All right, tough,

I don't make

That a crime.



And while it's going along,

You take for granted some love

Will wear away.

We took for granted a lot,

But still I say:

It could have kept on growing,

Instead of just kept on.

We had a good thing going,

Going,

Gone.



(Much applause, oohing and ahhing.)



GUSSIE

Keep them right there. We want to hear it again. Tell them. One mo' time.



CHARLEY

Frank, say "No."



FRANK

Charley, they loved it. They thought we were great.



CHARLEY

You want to know what true greatness is? It's knowing when to get off.



FRANK

I'll sing with you.



CHARLEY

No, no ?



FRANK

Come on.



CHARLEY

That's not the point, I really ?



(Frank starts to play.)



BOTH

It started out like a song.

We started quiet and slow,

With no surprise.

And then one morning I woke

To realize ?



TERRY

GWEN

(to another guest)

It's a clear case of Tammany politics. No more, A GUEST
