Merrily We Roll Along (1961 - 1960)

COMPANY

Travelling's the fun,

Flashing by the countryside.

Merrily we roll along, roll along,

Catching at dreams.

Yesterday is done.

See the pretty countryside,

Everybody merrily, merrily ?



(variously)

Nineteen sixty-one:

Some roads are easy,

Some roads are breezy,

Some roads the ride gets out of control,

Grinds to a halt and ends in a hole.

Some roads you stall before you can roll ?



Bobby and Jackie and Jack

CHARLEY

Nineteen sixty ?



BETH

It's nineteen sixty ?



FRANK

And gosh, what a swell year it's been!



ALL THREE

So many blessings,

Such wonders it has brought,

You hardly know where to begin:

There's Xerox and lasers,

The Twist and the Pill,

A city in Brazil



BETH

That no one wants to fill ?



ALL THREE

Krushchev stopped screaming

And Librium came in.



CHARLEY

And Nixon didn't win.



ALL THREE

Good bye then to Ike and the brass,

To years that were cozy but crass.

It's true Ike was icky,

But better him than Dicky ?

Now meet the first First Family with class,

En masse.



CHARLEY

There's Bobby



BETH

And Jackie



FRANK

And Jack.



ALL THREE

And myriads more in the back:

There's Ethel and Teddy and Pat alone,



CHARLEY

Plus Eunice



BETH

And Peter



FRANK

And Jean



TED

And Joan



CHARLEY

And what's-his-name ? ?



BETH

Stephen.



FRANK

And hold the phone ?

The one in the army ?



OTHERS

One in the army?



FRANK

Captain ? major ?



CHARLEY

Sargent!



FRANK

That's it!



ALL THREE

So many cards in the pack,

You want to know how to keep track?

Well, one is good looking and young and rich

While one is good looking and young and rich,

The rest are good looking and young and rich ?

There isn't a lot that they lack,

Not Bobby and Jackie and Jack

And Ethel and Ted and Eunice

and Pat and Joan and Steve and Peter and Jean and Sarge ?

There's probably dozens of others at large,

God knows ?

And Joe and Rose.

We're bringing back style to the White House.



BETH

I'm painting it cream for a start.



ALL THREE

We're making it into a cultural lighthouse

For glamour and beauty and art.



BETH

Evenings of the Budapest playing Vivaldi

And Munch doing bits of Ravel.

I'll get Leontyne Price to sing her

Medley from "Meistersinger"

And Margot Fonteyn to dance "Giselle."



CHARLEY

Together?



BOTH

Won't it be perfectly swell?



FRANK

We'll have Bernstein play next

On the Bechstein piano



CHARLEY

And Auden read poems and stuff



BETH

And Galina

(making a lot of the pronunciation)

Vishnevskya ?

The Russian soprano ?

Just pronouncing her name is refreshing enough!



ALL THREE

We're bringing back style to the White House,

With casual culture the rule.



FRANK

Let's have Tebaldi ?



CHARLEY

She makes a guy feel good.



BETH

And Oleg Cassini ?

Well, I think he's real good.



CHARLEY

And how about Heifetz?



BETH

And Callas!



FRANK

And Gielgud!



ALL THREE

And later, when everything's cool,

We'll push them all into the pool.



CHARLEY

With Bobby



BETH

And Jackie



FRANK

And Jack,



ALL THREE

The White House is under attack.



FRANK

Eight years is the limit but eight will do,



CHARLEY

By then there'll be Bobby ?



TED

? And Teddy, too ?



BETH

Or Peter or Stephen ?



FRANK, CHARLEY, TED

(to Beth)

? Or even you ?



BETH

? And then there's the colonel ?



BOYS

Colonel?



BETH

? Major??



BOYS

Major?



BETH

You know ? !



FRANK

Sargent.



BETH

Yes.



ALL THREE

Dozens to take up the slack

If anything goes out of whack.



FRANK

And some day elections will be unknown



BETH

'Cause each of our kids will ascend the throne



CHARLEY

And their kids will have more kids of their own ?



FRANK

? It's sort of a family knack ?



ALL THREE

Till half of the nation's

Made up of relations

Of Bobby and Jackie and Jack

And Ethel and Ted and Eunice and Pat and Joan

and Steve and Peter and Jean and Sarge

And Joe and Rose and rows and rows and rows

And rows and rows and rows and rows ?

The decade is starting anew,

And maybe the country is, too.
