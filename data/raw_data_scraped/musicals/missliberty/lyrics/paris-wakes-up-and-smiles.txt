Paris Wakes up and Smiles


When the sun goes down

Paris wakes up

Fills up her cup

And smiles



When the lights are low

Paris is high

Lights up the sky

For miles



When they stop playing shop on the Rue de la Paix

Count their stock and they lock up their styles



When the busy town

Goes home to sup

Paris wakes up

And smiles
