Policemen's Ball


Tickets for one and all

For the Policemen's Ball



Fifty cents for a gent and his bundle

Will admit you to the Policemen's Ball

Fifty cents and you're all set to trundle

Arm in arm and dance all around the hall



Dancin' 'round, gettin' hot 'neath the collar

If it starts to wilt from the lack of starch

There'll be six you can buy for a dollar

And you'll have a spare for the big Grand March



All evening they'll be tripping the light fantastic

Watch their suspenders stretching the old elastic



Each dress'd up in a suit made of cotton

Patent leather shoes that are much too small

But who cares? That'll soon be forgotten

Dancing at the Policemen's Ball



[coda:]

Come on let's go to the Policemen's Ball
