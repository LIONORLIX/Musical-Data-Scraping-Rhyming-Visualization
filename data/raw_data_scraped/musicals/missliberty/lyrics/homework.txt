Homework


I'm so tired of working in an office

And it's making me blue

There is work that don't require an office

That I'm anxious to do



Homework, I want to do homework

Instead of an office, I want to work home



Staying at home and crocheting

And meekly obeying

The guy who comes home



A cozy kitchen to be in there pitchin'

Is the thing I'm longing to do

To be there learning when a steak needs turning

And just what goes into a stew



Homework, I want to do homework

A genius who sits and plans with pots and pans at home

A genius who bakes a pie that keeps a guy at home

Homework, I want to do homework

Instead of an office, I want to work home



Messing around with French dressing

And slightly impressing

The guy who comes home



I long to settle with a steaming kettle

And a frying pan and a pot

And be the keeper of a carpet sweeper

That's the one ambition I've got



Homework, I want to do homework

A genius who has a way that makes him stay at home

A genius who has what takes that makes or breaks a home



[3]

Homework, I want to do homework

Instead of an office, I want to work home



Patching his trousers and matching

The part that keeps scratching

The guy who comes home



A table wiper who can change a diaper

Is the thing I'd like to be best

And be the master of a mustard plaster

When the cold goes down to his chest



Homework, I want to do homework

A genius who does her part so he don't start to roam

A genius who earns her keep that makes him sleep at home
