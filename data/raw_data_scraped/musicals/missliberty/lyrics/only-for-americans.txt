Only for Americans


[Horace:] Countess, you're my pal. Hey, we gotta celebrate!

[Countess:] What?

[Horace:] Yeah, first to Montmartre!

Then the Moulin Rouge!

The Folies Bergere!

[Countess:] Not at all....

[Horace:] Not Montmartre?

[Countess:] No.

[Horace:] Not the Moulin Rouge?

[Countess:] No.

[Horace:] Not the Folies Bergere?!

[Countess:] No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. They are



Only for Americans

The midnight life in gay Paree

The Frenchman he would never see

It's only for Americans

The prices in the smart cafe

The Frenchman he would never pay

The price that's more is only for

Americans from the U.S.A.



A Montmartre lady drops her hanky

And slyly winks her eye

That's only for the Yankee

The Frenchman wouldn't buy



Only for Americans

The Frenchmen on the boulevards

Don't buy those dirty postal cards

They're only for Americans

The little holes for peeping through

To see what naughty people do

The French would bore, they're only for

Americans from the U.S.A.



[2]

Only for Americans

The shops with many real antiques

Antiques as old as seven weeks

They're only for Americans

The bed on which a king made love

Which there are sev'ral dozen of

The French pooh pooh, we sell them to

Americans from the U.S.A.



Those old Napoleon brandy labels

That recently were made

They're not for Frenchmen's tables

They're for the Yankee trade



Only for Americans

The Frenchman gets his kisses free

But those for which there is a fee

Are only for Americans

You'll find two prices on a dress

One that is extremely less

The price that's more is only for

Americans from the U.S.A.



[3]

Only for Americans

A Frenchman's food is very plain

Those fancy sauces with ptomaine

Are only for Americans

A Frenchman seldom eats the snails

With little ulcers on their tails

And all that cheese was made to please

Americans from the U.S.A.



While the American carouses

Where crimson shadows creep

The French avoid those houses

They go to bed to sleep



Only for Americans

A Frenchman wouldn't be impressed

To see a show with girls undressed

That's only for Americans

The French don't go to naked shows

They've seen what's underneath the clothes

And each encore is only for

Americans from the U.S.A.



[4]

Only for Americans

The Frenchmen don't keep company

With south of France society

That's only for Americans

The Frenchman hasn't large amounts

To pay for Barons, Dukes and Counts

That you adore, they're only for

Americans from the U.S.A.



We like to keep the good relations

That nothing must upset

We give you decorations

That Frenchmen seldom get



Only for Americans

Our finest art is in the Louvre

The ones the experts don't approve

Are only for Americans

We keep an artist by the gate

To sign the paintings while you wait

Before they're dry, they're purchased by

Americans from the U.S.A.



[alternate bridge in 2nd chorus:]

We buy your worn out mink and sables

And fix them up like new

Then simply change the labels

And sell them back to you



[alternate ending:]

Only for Americans

The season starts, they come to town

They turn the city upside down

We use their Yankee Doodle dough

To clean up Paris when they go



But we can't do without them

We're simply mad about them

The Americans

The Americans

The Americans from the U.S.A.
