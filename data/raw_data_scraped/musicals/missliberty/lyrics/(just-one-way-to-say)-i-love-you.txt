(Just One Way to Say) I Love You


Why search for flowery phrases

Quoting what poets have said

Why talk in circles around it

Why not be simple instead

Let's hit the nail on the head



I love you, I love you

There's no other way

Just one way to say

I love you



I love you, I love you

And try as I may

That's all I can say

I love you



Much more could be said if I thought with my head

But I only can think with my heart



I love you, I love you

And yearn for the day

The day when you'll say

"I love you"



[2]

I could be oh, so indiff'rent

With very little success

I could continue pretending

But I'm afraid you would guess

So why not simply say, "Yes"?



I love you, I love you

There's no other way

Just one way to say

I love you



I love you, I love you

And try as I may

That's all I can say

I love you



Much more could be said if I thought with my head

But I only can think with my heart



I love you, I love you

And this is the day

The day when we'll say

"I love you"
