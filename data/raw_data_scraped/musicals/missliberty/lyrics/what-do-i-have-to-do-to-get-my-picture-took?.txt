What Do I Have to Do to Get My Picture Took?


I'd like my picture took

What do I have to do to get my picture took?

Who do I have to be to get my picture took with you?



I'd like to spark with you

Having a plate develop in the dark with you

Nothing I wouldn't do to get my picture took with you



Me sittin' down, you standin' up

Lookin' at the birdie will be fun

Hands in my lap, yours on your chest

Just like Napoleon



And someday we'll take a look

Into a fam'ly album or a mem'ry book

'Stead of a boring evening, we'll be laughing at

The picture that I took with you
