Invitation to the Jellicle Ball


Jellicle Cats come out tonight

Jellicle Cats come one, come all

The Jellicle Moon is shining bright

Jellicles come to the Jellicle Ball

Jellicle Cats come out tonight

Jellicles come to the Jellicle Ball



Jellicle Cats come out tonight

Jellicle Cats come one, come all

The Jellicle Moon is shinning bright

Jellicles come to the Jellicle Ball

Jellicle Cats come out tonight

Jellicle Cats come one, come all

The Jellicle Moon is shinning bright

Jellicles come to the Jellicle Ball



Jellicle Cats meet once a year

At the Jellicle Ball where we all rejoice

And the Jellicle Leader will soon appear

And make what is known as the Jellicle Choice

When Old Deuteronomy, just before dawn, through a silence you feel you could cut with a knife

Announces the cat who can now be reborn

And come back to a different Jellicle Life

For waiting up there is the Heaviside Layer

Full of wonders one Jellicle only will see

And Jellicles ask because Jellices dare



Who will it be?

Who will it be?
