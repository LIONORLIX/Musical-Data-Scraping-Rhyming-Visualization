Macavity: The Mystery Cat


Macavity! Macavity's a mystery cat

He's called the Hidden Paw

For he's a master criminal who can defy the law

He's the bafflement of Scotland Yard

The Flying Squad's despair

For when they reach the scene of crime Macavity's not there!



Macavity, Macavity, there's no one like Macavity

He's broken every human law

He breaks the law of gravity

His powers of levitation would make a fakir stare

And when you reach the scene of crime Macavity's not there!



You may seek him in the basement

You may look up in the air

But I tell you once and once again

Macavity's not there!



Macavity's a ginger cat

He's very tall and thin

You would know him if you saw him for his eyes are sunken in

His brow is deeply lined in thought

His head is highly domed

His coat is dusty from neglect

His whiskers are uncombed

He sways his head from side to side

With movements like a snake

And when you think he's half asleep

He's always wide awake!



Macavity, Macavity, there's no one like Macavity

For he's a fiend in feline shape

A monster of depravity

You may meet him in a by-street

You may see him in the square

But when a crime's discovered then Macavity's not there!



He's outwardly respectable

I know he cheats at cards

And his footprints are not found in any files of Scotland Yard's



And when the larder's looted

Or the jewel cases rifled

Or when the milk is missing

Or another Peke's been stifled

Or the greenhouse glass is broken and the trellis past repair

There's the wonder of the thing:

Macavity's not there!



Macavity, Macavity, there's no one like Macavity

There never was a cat of such deceitfulness and suavity

He always has an alibi and one or two to spare

Whatever time the deed took place, Macavity wasn't there!



And they say that all the cats whose wicked deeds are widely known

(I might mention Mungojerrie, Rumpelteazer, Griddlebone)

Are nothing more than agents for the cat who all the time

Just controls the operations

The Napoleon of Crime!



Macavity, Macavity, there's no one like Macavity

He's a fiend in feline shape

A monster of depravity

You may meet him in a by-street

You may see him in the square

But when a crime's discovered then Macavity's not there!
