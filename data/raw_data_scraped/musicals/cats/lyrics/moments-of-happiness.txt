Moments of Happiness


The moments of happiness . . .

We had the experience but missed the meaning

And approach to the meaning restores the experience

In a different form, beyond any meaning

We can assign to happiness . . .



The past experience revived in the meaning

Is not the experience of one life only

But of many generations - not forgetting

Something that is probably quite ineffable



Moonlight, turn your face to the moonlight

Let your memory lead you

Open up, enter in

If you find there the meaning of what happiness is

Then a new life will begin



Moonlight, turn your face to the moonlight

Let your memory lead you

Open up, enter in

If you find there the meaning of what happiness is

Then a new life will begin
