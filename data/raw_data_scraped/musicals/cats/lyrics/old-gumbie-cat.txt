Old Gumbie Cat


I have a Gumbie Cat in mind

Her name is Jennyanydots

Her coat is of the tabby kind with tiger stripes and leopard spots

All day she sits upon the stair or on the steps or on the mat

She sits and sits and sits and sits

And that's what makes a Gumbie Cat

That's what makes a Gumbie Cat!



But . . .

When the day's hustle and bustle is done

Then the Gumbie Cat's work is but hardly begun

And when all the family's in bed and asleep

She tucks up her skirts to the basement to creep

She is deeply concerned with the ways of the mice

Their behaviour's not good and their manners not nice

So when she has got them lined up on the matting

She teaches them music, crocheting and tatting



I have a Gumbie Cat in mind

Her name is Jennyanydots

The curtain cord she likes to wind and tie it into sailor knots

She sits upon the windowsill or anything that's smooth and flat

She sits and sits and sits and sits

And that's what makes a Gumbie Cat

That's what makes a Gumbie Cat!



But . . .

When the day's hustle and bustle is done

Then the Gumbie Cat's work is but hardly begun

She thinks that the cockroaches need employment

To prevent them from idle and wanton destroyment

So she's formed from that lot of disorderly louts

A troop of well disciplined helpful boy scouts

With a purpose in life and a good deed to do

And she's even created a Beetles tap too!



For she's a jolly good fellow!



Thank you my dears!
