Prologue: Jellicle Songs for Jellicle Cats


Are you blind when you're born?

Can you see in the dark?

Can you look at a king? Would you sit on his throne?

Can you say of your bite that it's worse than your bark?

Are you cock of the walk when you're walking alone?



Because Jellicles are and Jellicles do

Jellicles do and Jellicles would

Jellicles would and Jellicles can

Jellicles can and Jellicles do



When you fall on your head, do you land on your feet?

Are you tense when you sense there's a storm in the air?

Can you find your way blind when you're lost in the street?

Do you know how to go to the Heaviside Layer?



Because Jellicles can and Jellicles do

Jellicles do and Jellicles can

Jellicles can and Jellicles do

Jellicles do and Jellicles can

Jellicles can and Jellicles do



Can you ride on a broomstick to places far distant?

Familiar with candle, with book and with bell?

Were you Whittington's friend? The Pied Piper's assistant?

Have you been an alumnus of heaven or hell?



Are you mean like a minx?

Are you lean like a linx?

Are you keen to be seen when you're smelling a rat?

Where you there when the pharaohs commissioned the Sphinx?

If you were and you are, you're a Jellicle Cat

We can dive through the air like a flying trapeze

We can turn double somersaults, bounce on a tire

We can run up the wall, we can swing through the trees

We can balance on bars, we can walk on a wire



Jellicles can and Jellicles do

Jellicles can and Jellicles do

Jellicles can and Jellicles do

Jellicles can and Jellicles do

Can you sing at the same time in more than one key

Duets by Rossini and waltzes by Strauss

And can you (as cats do) begin with a C

That always triumphantly brings down the house



Jellicle cats are queen of the nights

Singing at astronomical heights

Handling pieces from the Messiah

Hallelujah, angelical choir



Jellicle Cats are queens of the night

Singing at astronomical heights

Handling pieces from the Messiah

Hallelujah, angelical choir



The mystical divinity of unashamed felinity

Round the cathedral rang "Vivat!"

Life to the everlasting cat!



Feline, fearless, faithful and true

To others who do what



Jellicles do and Jellicles can

Jellicles can and Jellicles do

Jellicle Cats sing Jellicle chants

Jellicles old and Jellicles new

Jellicle song and Jellicle dance

Practical cats, dramatical cats

Pragmatical cats, fanatical cats

Oratorical cats, delphioracle cats

Skeptical cats, dispeptical cats

Romantical cats, pedantical cats

Critical cats, parasitical cats

Allegorical cats, metaphorical cats

Statistical cats and mystical cats

Political cats, hypocritical cats

Clerical cats, hysterical cats

Cynical cats, rabbinical cats

There's a man over there with a look of surprise,

As much as to say, "Well now how about that!"

Do I actually see with my own very eyes

A man who's not heard of a Jellicle Cat?

What's a Jellicle cat?

What's a Jellicle cat?
