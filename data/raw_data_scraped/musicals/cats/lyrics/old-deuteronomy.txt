Old Deuteronomy



I believe it is Old Deuteronomy



Well, of all things, can it be really?

Yes! No! Ho! Hi! Oh, my eye!

My mind may be wandering, but I confess

I believe it is Old Deuteronomy!



Old Deuteronomy's lived a long time

He's a cat who has lived many lives in succession

He was famous in proverb and famous in rhyme

A long while before Queen Victoria's accession



Old Deuteronomy's buried nine wives

And more - I am tempted to say ninety-nine

And his numerous progeny, prospers and, thrives

And the village is proud of him in his decline



At the sight of that placid and bland physiognomy

When he sits in the sun on the vicarage wall



The Oldest Inhabitant croaks

Well, of all things, can it be really?

Yes! No! Ho! Hi! Oh, my eye!

My mind may be wandering, but I confess

I believe it is Old Deuteronomy!



Well, of all things, can it be really?

Yes! No! Ho! Hi! Oh, my eye!

My mind may be wandering, but I confess

I believe it is Old Deuteronomy!



Well, of all things, can it be really?

Yes! No! Ho! Hi! Oh, my eye!

My mind may be wandering, but I confess

I believe it is Old Deuteronomy!



Well, of all things, can it be really?

Yes! No! Ho! Hi! Oh, my eye!

My mind may be wandering, but I confess

I believe it is Old Deuteronomy!



My legs may be tottery, I must go slow

And be careful of Old Deuteronomy!
