Mungojerrie and Rumpelteazer


(Chuckle) Shhhh!

(Chuckle) Shhhh!



Mungojerrie and Rumpelteazer

We're a notorious couple of cats

As knockabout clowns, quick-change comedians

Tight-rope walkers and acrobats



We have an extensive reputation

We make our home in Victoria Grove

This is merely our center of operation

For we are incurably given to rove



If the area window is found ajar

And the basement looks like a field of war

If a tile or two comes loose on the roof

Which presently fails to be waterproof

If the drawers are pulled out from the bedroom chest

And you can't find one of your winter vests

Or after supper one of the girls

Suddenly misses her Woolworth pearls

The family will say, "It's that horrible cat!

It was Mungojerrie or Rumpelteazer!"

And most of the time they leave it at that



Mungojerrie and Rumpelteazer have a very unusual gift of the gab

We are highly efficient cat burglars as well

And remarkably smart at a smash and grab

We make our home in Victoria Grove

We have no regular occupation

We are plausible fellows who like to engage

A friendly policeman in conversation



When the family assembles for Sunday dinner

Their minds made up that they won't get thinner

On Argentine joint, potatoes and greens

Then the cook will appear from behind the scenes

And say in a voice that is broken with sorrow,

"I'm afraid you must wait and have dinner tomorrow!

For the joint has gone from the oven like that!"

The family will say, "It's that horrible cat!

It was Mungojerrie or Rumpelteazer!"

And most of the time they leave it at that



Mungojerrie and Rumpelteazer have a wonderful way of working together

And some of the time you would say it was luck

And some of the time you would say it was weather

We go through the house like a hurricane

And no sober person could take his oath

Was it Mungojerrie or Rumpelteazer?

Or could you have sworn that it mightn't be both?



And when you hear a dining room smash

Or up from the pantry there comes a loud crash

Or down from the library there comes a loud ping

From a vase that was commonly said to be Ming

Then family will say: "Now which was which cat?

It was Mungojerrie and Rumpelteazer!"

And there's nothing at all to be done about that!
