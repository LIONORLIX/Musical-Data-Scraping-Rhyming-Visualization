Jellicle Ball


Jellicle Cats come out tonight

Jellicle Cats come one, come all

The Jellicle Moon is shining bright

Jellicles come to the Jellicle Ball



Jellicle Cats are black and white

Jellicle Cats are rather small

Jellicle Cats are merry and bright

And pleasant to hear when we caterwaul



Jellicle Cats have cheerful faces

Jellicle Cats have bright black eyes

We like to practice our airs and graces

And wait for the Jellicle Moon to rise



Jellicle Cats develop slowly

Jellicle Cats are not too big

Jellicle Cats are rolly poly

We know how to dance a gavotte and a jig



Until the Jellicle Moon appears

We make our toilette and take our repose

Jellicles wash behind their ears

Jellicles dry between their toes



Jellicle Cats are white and black

Jellicle Cats are of moderate size

Jellicles jump like a jumping jack

Jellicle Cats have moonlit eyes



We're quiet enough in the morning hours

We're quiet enough in the afternoon

Reserving our terpsichorean powers

To dance by the light of the Jellicle Moon



Jellicle Cats are black and white

Jellicle Cats (as we said) are small

If it happens to be a stormy night

We will pracitce a caper or two in the hall



If it happens the sun is shining bright

You would say we had nothing to do at all

We are resting and saving ourselves to be right

For the Jellicle Moon and the Jellicle Ball



Jellicle Cats come out tonight

Jellicle Cats come one, come all

The Jellicle Moon is shining bright

Jellicles come to the Jellicle Ball
