Skimbleshanks: The Railway Cat


Skimbleshanks the Railway Cat, the Cat of the Railway Train

There's a whisper down the line at eleven thirty-nine

When the Night Mail's ready to depart

Saying, "Skimble, where is Skimble?

Has he gone to hunt the thimble?

We must find him or the train can't start"



All the guards and all the porters

And the station master's daughters

Would be searching high and low

Saying "Skimble where is Skimble for unless he's very nimble

Then the night mail just can't go."



At eleven forty-two with the signal overdue

And the passengers all frantic to a man

That's when I would appear and I'd saunter to the rear

I'd been busy in the luggage van!



Then he gave one flash of his glass-green eyes

And the signal went "All Clear!"

They'd be off at last to the northern part of the Northern Hemisphere!



Skimbleshanks the Railway Cat

The Cat of the Railway Train

You might say that by and large it was me who was in charge

Of the Sleeping Car Express

From the driver and the guards to the bagmen playing cards

I would supervise them all more or less



Down the corridor he paces and examines all the faces

Of the travellers in the first and the third

He established control by a regular patrol

And he'd know at once if anything occurred



He would watch you without winking and he saw what you were thinking

And it's certain that he didn't approve

Of hilarity and riot so that folk were very quiet

When Skimble was about and on the move



You could play no pranks with Skimbleshanks!

He's a cat that couldn't be ignored

So nothing went wrong on the Northern Mail

When Skimbleshanks was aboard



It was very pleasant when they'd found their little den

With their name written up on the door

And the berth was very neat with a newly folded sheet

And not a speck of dust upon the floor



There was every sort of light

You could make it dark or bright

And a button you could turn to make a breeze

And a funny little basin you're supposed to wash your face in

And a crank to shut the window should you sneeze



Then the guard looked in politely and would ask you very brightly,

"Do you like your morning tea weak or strong?"

But I was just behind him and was ready to remind him

For Skimble won't let anything go wrong



When they crept into their cosy berth and pulled up the counterpane

They all could reflect that it was very nice

To know that they wouldn't be bothered by mice

They can leave all that to the Railway Cat

The Cat of the Railway Train



Skimbleshanks the Railway Cat

The Cat of the Railway Train

In the watches of the night I was always fresh and bright

Every now and then I'd have a cup of tea

With perhaps a drop of scotch while I was keeping on the watch

Only stopping here and there to catch a flea



They were fast asleep at Crewe and so they never knew

That I was walking up and down the station

They were sleeping all the while I was busy at Carlisle

Where I met the station master with elation



They might see me at Dumfries if I summoned the police

If there was anything they ought to know about



When they got to Gallowgate there they did not have to wait

For Skimbleshanks would help them to get out!



And he gives a wave of his long brown tail

Which says "I'll see you again!

You'll meet without fail on the Midnight Mail

The Cat of the Railway Train!"
