Something Just Broke


WOMAN 1

I was out

In the yard,

Taking down the bed sheets,

When my neighbor yelled across:



PROPRIETOR

"The president's been shot."



WOMAN 1

I remember where I was,

Just exactly where I was,

In the yard out back--



PROPRIETOR

"The president's been shot."



MAN 1

I was getting me a shoeshine--



WOMAN 1

--Folding sheets--



MAN 1

--When I heard--



WOMAN 2

We were waiting for a carriage--



MAN 1

--Newsboys--



WOMAN 2

Suddenly there's shouting in the street--



WOMAN 1

--Lizzie's sheets...



THE PROPRIETOR

"The president's been shot."



WOMAN 2

I'll remember it forever--



WOMAN 1

And I thought:



WOMAN 2 and MAN 1

--Where I was, what I was doing--



WOMAN 1

Something just broke...



PROPRIETOR

"The president's been shot."



MAN 1

My God--!



MAN 2

I was up near the ridge,

Plowing--



MAN 3

We were working at the plant--



WOMAN 2

I was halfway throguh correcting the exams--



MAN 2

--When my wife



MAN 3

It was Mike--



MAN 2

She comes tearing 'cross the field--



MAN 3

--Mike the forman--



WOMAN 2

In runs billy--



MAN 3

I mean, he was crying--



WOMAN 2

He was crying--



MAN 2

She was crying--



WOMAN 2, MAN 2, MAN 3

I'll remember it forever...



WOMAN 1

And I thought:



PROPRIETOR

"The president's been shot."



WOMAN 1

You know what?

There are presidents who aren't worth a lot.



WOMAN 2, MAN 2, MAN 3

I kept thinking:



WOMAN 1

There's the kind that gets elected, then forgot.



MAN 1 and WOMAN 1

Mr. Garfield--



WOMAN 2

Mr. Lincoln



MAN 1 and WOMAN 1

--He's a hack.



MAN 3 and WOMAN 1

Bill McKinley--



WOMAN 2

--He's a giant.



MAN 1, MAN 3, WOMAN 1

--He's a joke.



WOMAN 1

Still, something just broke...



PROPRIETOR

"The president is rallying."

"The president is sinking."

"The president is dead."



WOMAN 1

Something just broke.



MAN 2

I was down at the Exchange...



WOMAN 1

Something just made a little dent.



WOMAN 2

I'd been shopping...



MAN 1

I'd been sick...



WOMAN 1

Something just broke--



MAN 3

All I know, it was a Friday...



WOMAN 1

Only for a moment.



MAN1, MAN 2, MAN 3, BOY

I remember it exactly...



WOMAN 1

Something got bent.



WOMAN 2

I'm taking the order...



WOMAN 1

Something jsut left a little mark.



BOY

I was getting dressed...



WOMAN 2

...two potato soups...



WOMAN 1

Something just went a little dark.

Something just went.



MAN 2

And I wondered:



WOMAN 2

I was scared--



MAN 2 and WOMAN 2

What would follow...



WOMAN 1

Something to be mended.



MAN 1

Made me wonder who we are...



WOMAN 1

Something we'll have to weather--



MAN 2

It was seeing all those torches...



WOMAN 1

Bringing us all together--



MAN 2

He was me...



MAN 3

He was us...



WOMAN 1

--If only for a moment...



ALL

I'll remember it forever...



WOMAN 1

Nothing has really ended--



MAN 1, MAN 2, MAN 3, BOY

Where I was, what I was doing...



WOMAN 1

Only just be suspended...



MAN 1, MAN 2, MAN 3, BOY

Like a flash...



WOMAN 1

'Cause something just stirred...



VARIOUS

And I thought

And I thought to myself

And I thought

And I thought

I kept thinking



WOMAN 1

Something just woke.



ALL

Something just spoke,

Something I wish I hadn't heard,

Something bewildering occurred.



BOY and MAN 2

Fix it up fast,

Please--



MAN 2 and MAN 3

Till it's just smoke.



WOMAN 1 and WOMAN 2

Till it's only "Something just passed"--

--Nothing that will last.



WOMAN 1, WOMAN 2, MAN 1

Where I was, what i was doing...



MAN 2, MAN 3, BOY

Nothing but the moment...



WOMAN 2

Just an awful moment...



WOMAN 1

But something just--
