Unworthy of Your Love


[HINCKLEY]

I am nothing,

You are wind and water and sky,

Jodie.

Tell me, Jodie,

How I can earn you love.

I would swim oceans,

I would move mountains,

I would do anything for you.

What do you want me to do?



I am unworthy of your love,

Jodie, Jodie,

Let me prove worthy of you love.

Tell me how I can earn your love,

Set me free.

How can I turn your love

To me?



[FROMME]

I am nothing,

You are wind and devil and God,

Charlie,

Take my blood and my body

For your love.

Let me feel fire,

Let me drink poison,

Tell me to tear my heart in two,

If that's what you want me to do...



I am unworthy of you love,

Charlie darlin',

I have done nothing for your love.

Let me be worthy of your love,

Set you free-



[HINCKLEY]

I would come take you from you life...



[FROMME]

I would come take you from your cell...



[HINCKLEY]

You would be queen to me, not wife...



[FROMME]

I would crawl belly deep through hell...



[HINCKLEY]

Baby, I'd die for you...



[FROMME]

Baby, I'd die for you...



[HINCKLEY]

Even though-



[FROMME]

Even though-



[HINCKLEY+FROMME]

I will always know:

I am unworthy of

Your love,

Jodie\Charlie darlin',



[BOTH]

Let me prove worthy of your love.

I'll find a way to earn your love,

Wait and see.

Then you will turn your love to me,

Your love to me...
