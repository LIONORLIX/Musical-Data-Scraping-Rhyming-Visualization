(at the gallows)

I am going to the Lordy,

I am so glad.

[BALLADEER]

Come all ye Christians,

And hear from sinner:

Charlie Guiteau.

Bound and determined

He'd wind up a winner,

Charlie had dreams

That he wouldn't let go.

Said, "Nothing to it,

I want it, I'll do it,

I'm Charles J. Guiteau."



Charlie Guiteau

Never said "Never"

Or heard the word "No."

Faced with disaster,

His heart would beat faster,

His smile would just grow,

And he'd say:



[GUITEAU]

Look on the bright side,

Look on the bright side,

Sit on the right side

Of the lord.

This is the land of

Opportunity,

He is your lightning,

You his sword.



Wait till you see tomorrow,

Tomorrow you'll get you reward!

You can be sad

Or you can be President-

Look on the bright side...

I am going to the Lordy...



[BALLADEER]

Charlie Guiteau

Drew a crowd to his trial,

Led them in prayer,

Said, "I killed Garfield,

I'll make no denial.

I was just acting

for someone up there.

The Lord's my employer,

And now He's my lawyer,

So do what you dare."



Charlie said, "Hell,

If I am guilty,

Then God is as well."

But God was aquitted

And Charlie committed

Until he should hang.

Still, he sang:



[GUITEAU]

Look on the bright side,

Not on the black side.

Get off your backside,

Shine those shoes!



This is you golden

Opportunity:

You are the lightning

And you're news!



Wait till you see tomorrow,

Tomorrow you won't be ignored!

You could be pardoned,

You could be President-

Look on the bright side...

I am going to the Lordy...



[BALLADEER]

Charlie Guiteau

Had a crowd at the scaffold-



[GUITEAU]

I am so glad...



[BALLADEER]

-Filled up the square,

Som many people

That tickets were raffled.

Shine on his shoes

Charlie mounted the stair,

Said, "Never sorrow,

Just wait till tomorrow,

Today isn't fair.

Don't despair..."



[GUITEAU]

Look on the bright side,

Look on the bright side,

Sit on the right side...



Of the...



I am going to the Lordy,

I am so glad!

I am going to the Lordy,

I am so glad!

I have unified my party,

I have saved my country.



I shall be remembered!



I am going to the Lordy...



[BALLADEER]

Look on the bright side,

Not on the sad side,

Inside the bad side

Something's good!

This is you golden

Opportunity:

You've been a preacher-



[GUITEAU]

Yes, I have!



[BALLADEER]

You've been an author-



[GUITEAU]

Yes, I have!



[BALLADEER]

You've been a killer-



[GUITEAU]

Yes, I have!



[BALLADEER]

You could be an angel_



[GUITEAU]

Yes, I could!



[BALLADEER]

Just wait until tomorrow,

Tomorrow they'll all climb aboard!

What if you never

Got to be President?

You'll be remembered-

Look on the bright side-

Trust in tomorrow-



[BOTH]

And the Lord!
