It's No Problem


ob:

Look, Dick, Laura and I broke up.

So if you ever see Barry again maybe you can tell him that.



Dick:

You want ME to tell Barry about it?



Rob:

Yeah, would you?



Dick:

Sure, of course.



It's no problem.

No problem Rob--you're on.

I'll tell him when I see him next,

"Rob says to tell you--Laura's gone."

My schedule's pretty open

So I've got some time today.

Plus I've got some other stuff

To tell him anyway.



So I'll tell him when I tell him all the other stuff

Or--I could even call.

So it's no problem, no problem at all.



Rob:

All right, Dick--



Dick:

It's no problem.

I'll see him later at a gig.

I'll prob'ly start with your news first

Cause my news isn't big:

Just to tell him

That this woman's gonna sing.

So I'll bring it up before,

A good news/bad news kind of thing.



I mean bad news/good news

Cause he thinks the singer's great.

Not that Laura isn't too--no!

What I meant to say--no wait!



Barry really likes you both

He told me so last fall,

So it's no problem, it's no problem,

It's no problem, Rob

A-a-a-a-at--



Rob:

GREAT, Dick. Glad you got it covered.



Dick:

It's no problem, Rob. At all.
