Nine Percent Chance


Rob:

Why am I feeling so good?

Why am I feeling so high?

Like I could reach for the sky

And nothing's gonna bring me down

Cause you paved the way for romance

When you kept him out of your pants

I'm a new man today

And I say,

Hey! Hey!

Hey, hey, hey!



I've got a nine percent chance of your love

A nine percent chance of your love

Nine percent of the time it's me you're thinking of

My foot's in the door

And if you're keeping score

I only need ninety-one more!



I'm back on my game now

And fit as a fiddle

Cause you can't deny that you want me a little

I'm back in the driver's seat

Or at least in the car

I'm back on the road to where you are



I've got a nine percent chance of your love

A nine percent chance of your love

And I'm pretty sure it's just a matter of when

My chances go up to ten!



Barry:

I'm gonna lay it all on the line

Get out from under this bushel and shine

I've got music to make and finally I will be heard

I've been hiding myself, that's what's wrong

The world's done without me for far too long

Hey, Coldplay! Get out of my way!

Hey! Hey!

Hey, hey, hey!



I've got a one percent chance of success

A one percent chance, maybe less

I will be known as His Royal Rock Highness

Facing the odds at a hundred to one

But that's still better than none



Rob & Barry:

Sometimes all you need is a sliver of hope and

You may just succeed, or at least the door's open

What once seemed impossible is there in your reach

You're riding the wave, or at least on the beach



Rob:

I could win back her heart



Barry:

I could make the chicks dance

I've got a one percent



Rob:

A nine percent chance



Dick:

I'm gonna find out her last name

And find out if she feels the same

I'll ask her out and get to see what's in her heart

There's not much hope I can win it

But the game has begun and look who's in it

Who knows? She might go...

Yeah, maybe if I was the last guy on Earth.

There's a point, Oh

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh



One percent chance she'll say yes

About one in a billion, I guess

I'm approaching infinity and happiness

We could go on a date

It could be anyday

I'm only light years away



I'm gonna ask Anna out!



Barry:

I'm gonna rock the world!



Rob:

She hasn't slept with him yet!

That's what she said



Others:

She said



Dick:

Maybe there is a God!



Barry:

Maybe I've got a prayer!



Rob:

Maybe, oh maybe, Elvis isn't dead!



Others:

Dead!



All:

Sometimes all you need is a sliver of hope and

You may just succeed or at least the door's open

What once seemed impossible is there in your reach

You're riding the wave, or at least on the beach



Rob:

If I've got a chance



Barry:

And I've got a chance



Dick:

Then I've got a chance



Three:

Hey! Hey!

Hey, hey, hey!



Others:

Hey! Hey!

Hey, hey, hey!



Rob:

I've got a nine percent chance of your love!



Others:

Nine percent chance of your love!



Rob:

Nine percent chance of your love!



Others:

Nine percent chance of your love!



Rob:

Nine percent of the time it's me your thinking of!



All:

Ah!



Rob:

You say that it's hopeless

Well, I say that's cool

It might come from a rope

But that's nine percent fool

But that's a five percent chance



All:

Five percent chance



Rob:

A nine percent chance!



All:

Nine percent chance!



Rob & All:

Of your love

Of your love

Of your love
