I Slept With Someone (Who Handled Kurt Cobain's Intervention)


Laura:

I slept with someone who handled

Kurt Cobain's intervention.

He taught me all these tantric moves

And he's really good at frenchin'!

He's vibrant and creative

And makes salads that have flowers.

He slathers me in oils and massages me for hours...

and hours...and hours.



He's caring and supportive,

And gives me his full attention.

I slept with someone

Who handled a dead rock star's intervention.



Finally, a grown-up

Who always pays his bills.

He's got insurance, self-assurance, marketable skills.

He's not like all the others,

Only one thing on the brain

But if I had my druthers

...I'd have slept with Kurt Cobain.



I slept with someone who handled

Kurt Cobain's intervention.

A fact which all too often,

he's all too glad to mention.



And what is there to brag about?

I wouldn't go and shout it

Cause it really didn't go so well

When you thjink about it



But I won't think about it

Or why my jaw keeps clenchin'

Or the fact that when he's mounting me

I feel this mountain tension!



I slept with someone who handled

Kurt Cobain's intervention.
