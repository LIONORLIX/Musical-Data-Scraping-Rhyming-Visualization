It's No Problem (Reprise)


It's no problem.

So she doesn't like The Clash.

And she likes 'Achy Breaky Heart'

And thinks it's sung by Johnny Cash.



She's really into learning stuff--

So it should be okay.

But if she weren't,

I'd still like her anyway.

Cause she's pretty and real nice and smart

And not too short

And also not too tall.

So it's no problem--no problem at all.



It's no problem

Though our tastes may disagree

She may not like the things I like

But she says she likes me.



And her laughing

Is my fav'rite sound by far

And I'm thinking,

It's not what you like that counts

But who you are.



When it comes to favorite Beatle

Mine is George



Anna:

And mine is Paul.



Dick:

But it's no problem...



Anna:

It's no problem...



Both:

It's no pro-blem!

...at all.
