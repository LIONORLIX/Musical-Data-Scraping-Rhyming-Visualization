Too Tired


All I want is to be taken care of

And there's no one inside there who can

All this sad talking I've had my share of

So when I heard that you skipped out, I ran



I keep hoping this is all some lousy dream

I don't want to reminisce

I want to scream



Look at us, now is it any wonder

That we're both such a pitiful mess

We're just kids trapped inside of these bodies

How we get by is anyone's guess

Is this the way life's always gonna be

Well if that's the case I think you'd better sleep with me



I'm too tired not to be with you

I'm too sad I feel too bad and I can't deal with anyone new

So you're hired I'll bet you like it too

It's either that or do myself harm

Stub a cigarette out on my arm

I guess sex will have to do

'Cause I'm too tired not to be with you



Look I know this isn't very romantic

But it may be again by and by

I could say don't come back till you've wised up

Try to change you but then again why



I know you and we get along okay

And you've made it clear you want me back so what the hey



I'm too tired not to be with you

I'm too fried and cold inside and I need to feel a little less blue

But I'm too wired to stop and think this through

I just want to disappear

And wake up some time next year

Oh this is wrong I know and it's so long ago that I looked at you from here



Just let me love you

I don't know what else to do

'Cause I'm too tired

I'm so tired, I'm too tired

I'm so tired, I'm too tired, not to be with you
