Number 5 With A Bullet


Laura:

I was feeling bad for you

Cause I left you with a broken heart

But now you really pissed me off

And you know that that's not smart

Did you think you were gonna get off scott-free?

Don't you know there's no getting over me?

Mmmm



You think this break up won't affect you

If you just refuse to let it

And there's no need to sweat it

Well, I've come to claim my spot

And I'm not leaving till I get it!



I will be Number Five with a bullet

You'll never get rid of me

Sleep and your piece of mind

Their a memory

Yeah

Number Five with a bullet

Climbing up the chart

Number Five with a bullet

To your heart



Ex-Girlfriends:

To your heart

To your heart

You met and it was wonderful

No drama and no pain

She was smart and sexy

Sweet and hot



Laura:

And not insane

You were the handsome DJ

I worked for legal aid

We really clicked together



Ex-Girlfriends:

Oh yeah

You really had it made



Laura:

But you always had one foot out the door

Didn't you?

Now in case there might be something more...



Ex-Girlfriends:

Look out, she's gone!

Moved up, moved on

Left you in the dust

Left you with a longing

And a think and aching lust



Laura:

Well you can block the truth out for a while

If you will yourself

But when you think of me with another guy



Laura & Ex-Girlfriends:

Don't you wanna kill yourself?



Ex-Girlfriends:

Bum

Bum

Bum



Laura:

I will be



All:

Number Five with a bullet



Laura:

Like a tape that's un-rewind

Playing in your head



Laura & Ex-Girlfriends:

Messing with your mind



Laura:

Yeah, yeah

I will be



All:

Number Five with a bullet

A sharp and throbbing pain

Lodged there like a bullet in your brain



Laura:

You're on a cycle that never ceases

You get dumped and you fall to pieces

You were hoping for a reversal

But that pain was just the dress rehearsal



All:

Yeah, yeah, yeah

Number Five with a bullet

See, your memory's a blur



Laura:

And the list don't mean nothing without me



Ex-Girlfriends:

Without her



Laura:

Yeah



All:

Number Five with a bullet

Climbing up the chart

Number Five with a bullet

To your heart

Number Five with a bullet

To your heart

Number Five with a bullet

To your heart

Number Five with a bullet

To your heart



(Dance Break. Ian comes out in the midst as the Ex-Girlfriends, Laura, and Ian join in one orgy.)



All:

Number Five with a bullet



Ian:

Oh, can you feel my hungry kiss?



Laura:

I've made love a thousand times

But nothing can touch this



Ian:

Touch this!



Laura:

Wow!!



Laura & Ex-Girlfriends:

Number Five with a bullet



Laura:

Whoa



Ex-Girlfriends:

And she's climbing up the chart



Rob:

Stop! Show me no more! Congratulations, Laura. You made it.



Laura & Ex-Girlfriends:

Number Five with a bullet

And that bullets headed straight to your heart!



Laura:

Yeah!
