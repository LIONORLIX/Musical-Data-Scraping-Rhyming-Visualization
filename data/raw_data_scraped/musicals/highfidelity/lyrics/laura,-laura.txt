Laura, Laura


I made a list of everything

That's gone on between you and me

And even an idiot like me could see



No matter how you add it up

When you reach the bottom line

The fault was usually mine.



The stupid things I've said and done

If I could change just even one

the thing I'd say would be:

Laura, Laura...I'm so sorry.



It's become my trade in stock

To always jump fron rock to rock

Chasing fantasies that don't come through.



Thought I was happy just to coast

But it's me who needed you the most.

Of course that's something

I could never own up to.



I want to look you in the face to say

What I never had the grace to say

When you were still with me:

Laura, Laura...I'm so sorry.



For everything you're going through

And everything I can't undo,

Please accept this small apology



Oh, Laura, Laura,

Sweet, sweet Laura

Laura, Laura...



For letting you down...

For letting you go...

I'm so sorry.
