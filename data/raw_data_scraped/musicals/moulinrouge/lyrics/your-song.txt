Your Song


I don't have much money but boy if I did

I'd buy a big house where we both could live

If I was a sculptor but then again no

Or a man who makes potions in a traveling show

Oh I know it's not much but it's the best I can do



My gift is my song... and this one's for you

And you can tell everybody that this is your song

It may be quite simple, but now that it's done

I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind

That I put down in words...

How wonderful life is, now you're in the world



I sat on the roof and I kicked off the moss

Well some of these verses, well they,

They've got me quite cross

But the sun's been kind while I wrote this song

It's for people like you that keep it turned on



So excuse me forgetting, but these things I do

You see I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue

Anyway, the thing is, what I really mean

Yours are the sweetest eyes, I've ever seen



And you can tell everybody that this is your song

It may be quite simple but now that it's done

I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind

That I put down in words

How wonderful life is, now you're in the world

I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind

That I put down in words

How wonderful life is, now you're in the world
