Glory awaits Christian

This is Montmartre

It is a hard life we led

But we have our honor

I've never seen a diamond in the flesh

I cut my teeth on wedding rings in the movies

And I'm not proud of my address,

in the torn up town

No post code envy

But everybody's like Cristal, Maybach,

Diamonds on your timepiece

Steam ships, islands, tigers on a gold leash

We don't care,

We're not caught up in your love affair

And we'll never be royals (royals)

It don't run in our blood

That kind of lux just ain't for us

We crave a different kind of buzz

Let me be your ruler (ruler)

You can call me Queen B

And baby I'll rule (I'll rule I'll rule)

Let me live that fantasy



Now tell me Christian

What do we believe in?

Freedom Beauty Truth Love

Freedom Beauty Truth Love



Well you can bump and grind

See it's good for your mind

You can twist and shout

Let it all hang out

But you won't fool the

Children of the revolution

No you won't fool the

Children of the revolution



Tonight, we are young

So let's set the world on fire

We can burn brighter than the sun



And we'll never be royals (Tonight)

It don't run in our blood (We are young)

That kind of lux just ain't for us (So let's set the world on fire)

We can burn brighter than the sun

I've never seen a diamond in the flesh



Tonight (But you won't fool the Children of the revolution)

We are young (You won't fool the Children of the revolution)

No you won't fool the Children of the revolution (Tonight)

We are

Freedom

Beauty

Truth

Love
