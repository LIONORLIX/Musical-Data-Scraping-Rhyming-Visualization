Firework


Do you ever feel

Feel so paper thin

Like a house of cards

One blow from caving in



Do you ever feel already buried deep

Six feet under screams

But no one seems to hear a thing

Do you know that there's

Still a chance for you

Cause there's a spark in you



You just gotta ignite the light

And let it shine

Just own the night

Like the Fourth of July



You don't have to feel like a waste of space

You're an original, cannot be replaced

If you only knew what the future holds

After a hurricane comes a rainbow



Maybe the reason why all the doors are closed

So you could open one that leads you to the perfect road

Like a lightning bolt

Your heart will glow

And when it's time

You'll know



You just gotta ignite the light

And let it shine

Just own the night

Like the Fourth of July



'Cause baby you're a firework

Come on show 'em what your worth

Make 'em go "Oh, oh, oh!"

As you shoot across the sky-y-y



Baby you're a firework

Come on let your colors burst

Make 'em go "Oh, oh, oh!"

You're gonna leave 'em going "Oh,oh,oh!"



Do you ever feel

Feel so paper thin

Like a house of cards

One blow from caving in
