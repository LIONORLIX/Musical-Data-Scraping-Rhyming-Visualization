You know that I want you, and you know that I need you

Too high, can't come down

Losin' my head

Spinnin' round and round

Do you feel me now?



With the taste of your lips, I'm on a ride

You're toxic, I'm slipping under

With the taste of your poison paradise

I'm addicted to you

Don't you know that you're toxic



Some of them want to use you

Some of them want to be used by you

Some of them want to abuse you

Some of them want to be abused



I want your lovin' and I want your revenge

You and me could write a bad romance

I want your love and all your lovers' revenge

You and me could write a bad romance
