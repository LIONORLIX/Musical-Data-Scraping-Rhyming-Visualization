Only Girl In A Material World


DUKE (spoken):

It's like I can have every part of you,

Except what I really want.

I want you to love me,



Like I'm a hot ride

Keep thinkin' of me

Doin' what you like

So girl, forget about the world

'Cause it's gonna be me and you tonight

I wanna make your beg for it

Then I'mma make you swallow your pride, oh

I want to make you feel like

You're the only girl in the world

Like I'm the only one that you'll ever love

Like I'm the only one who knows your heart

Only girl in the world

Like I'm the only one that's in command

'Cause you're the only one who understands

How to make me feel like a man, oh



(spoken):

Do you trust me?

It's time, my dear, to dress the part.

Let me make you rise

Take you for a ride

Let me make you rise (Only girl in the world)

Take you for a ride (Only girl in the world)

I want to make you feel

Like I'm the only one that you'll ever love

Like I'm the only one who knows your heart

Only girl in the world

Like I'm the only one that's in command

'Cause you're the only one who understands

How to make me feel like a man



SATINE:

A kiss on the hand might

Be quite continental (Material girl)

A kiss may be grand

But it won't pay the rental (Material world)

There may come a time

When they're no longer calling (Material girl)

And so I must climb just to keep me from falling

Only girl in the world

Only girl in the world
