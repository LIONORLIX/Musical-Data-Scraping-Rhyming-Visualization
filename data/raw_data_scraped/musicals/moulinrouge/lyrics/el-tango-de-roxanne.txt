El Tango De Roxanne


Roxanne



His eyes upon your face

His hand upon your hand

His lips caress your skin

It's more than I can stand



Roxanne

You don't have to put on that red light

Walk the streets for money

You don't care if it's wrong or if it is right



Roxanne

You don't have to wear that dress tonight

Roxanne

You don't have to sell your body to the night



(Roxanne)

Why does my heart cry?

(Roxanne)

Feelings I can't fight

You're free to leave me, but just don't deceive me

And please believe me when I say I love you



(Roxanne, you don't have to put on that red light)

Why does my heart cry?

(Roxanne, you don't have to wear that dress tonight)

Feelings I can't fight

(Roxanne, you don't have to put on that red light)

(Roxanne, you don't have to wear that dress tonight)

Roxanne (screaming)

Roxanne (screaming)
