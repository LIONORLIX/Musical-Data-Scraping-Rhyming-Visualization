Shut Up and Raise Your Glass


Oh, don't you dare look back

Just keep your eyes on me

She said you're holding back

She said

Shut up and dance with me



This woman is my destiny

She said

Ooh, ooh

Shut up and dance with me



So raise your glass if you are wrong

In all the right ways

All my underdogs

We will never be, never be

Anything but loud

And nitty gritty

Dirty little freaks



Won't you come on and, come on and

Raise your glass

Just come on and, come on

Raise your glass



We were victims of the night

The chemical, physical

Kryptonite

Helpless to the bass and the fading light

Oh, we were bound to get together

Bound to get together



She took my arm

I don't know how it happened

We took the floor and she said



Oh, don't you dare look back

Just keep your eyes on me

She said you're holding back

She said shut up and dance with me



This woman is my destiny

She said

Ooh, ooh

Shut up and dance with me

Ooh, ooh

Shut up and dance with me



Slam, slam

Oh, hot damn

What part of party don't you understand

We should just freak out



Can't stop

Coming in hot

I should be locked up right on the spot

Why so serious?



Oh, don't you dare look back

(Slam, slam, oh, hot damn)

Just keep your eyes on me

(What part of party don't you understand)

She said you're holding back

(We should just freak out)

She said shut up and dance with me



This woman is my destiny

(Can't stop, coming in hot, I should be locked up)

She said (Right on the spot)

Ooh, ooh (It's so on right now)

Shut up and dance with me

Ooh, ooh

Shut up and dance with me



Well done Christian

We are mere moments from victory

This is our night

We are young

We are brave

We are

Bohemians



Oh, don't you dare look back (Oh)

Just keep your eyes on me

(I wanna dance with somebody)

I said you're holding back

(I wanna feel the heat with somebody)

She said shut up and dance with me



This woman is my destiny

(Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody)

She said

Ooh, ooh

Shut up and dance with me
