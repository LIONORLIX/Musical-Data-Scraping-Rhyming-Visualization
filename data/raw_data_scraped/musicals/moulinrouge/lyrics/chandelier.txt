Have you know the dreadful power of absinthe

The green fairy makes every man a visionary

So drink, and rage and forget

Party girls

They don't get hurt can't feel anything

When will you learn you must push it down

You must push it do-ow-own

I'm the one for a good time call

Phone's blowin' up ringin' your doorbell

You feel the love you feel the lo-o-ove

One, two, three one, two, three, drink

One, two, three

One, two, three one, two, three, drink one, two, three, drink

One, two, three

One, two, three one, two, three, drink one, two, three, drink

Throw 'em back

Throw 'em back 'till I lose count 'till I lose count

I'm gonna swing

From the chandelier

From the chandelier

I'm gonna live like

Tomorrow doesn't exist like it doesn't exist

I'm

I'm gonna fly gonna fly

Like a bird

Like a bird through the night through the night

Feel my tears

Feel my tears as they dry as they dry

I'm

I'm gonna swing gonna swing

From the chandelier

From the chandelier

From the chandelier

From the chandelier

But I'm holding on for dear life

Won't look down

Won't open my eyes

Keep this glass full until morning light

'Cos we're just holding on for tonight

Help me I'm holding on for dear life

Won't look down won't open my eyes

Keep my glass full until morning light

'Cos I'm just holding on for tonight

On for tonight

On for tonight

On, on for tonight

On for tonight

On, on for tonight

On for to, on for to

On for tonight

On for to, on for to

On on on on

We're creatures of the underworld

We can't afford to blood

I'm

I'm gonna swing gonna swing

From the chandelier

From the chandelier

From the chandelier

From the chandelier

I'm

I'm gonna live like gonna live like

Tomorrow doesn't exist

Tomorrow doesn't exist like it

Doesn't exist like it doesn't exist

I'm

I'm gonna fly like a bird gonna fly like a bird

Through the night

Through the night feel my tears

As they dry feel my tears as they dry

I'm

I'm gonna swing gonna swing

From the chandelier

From the chandelier

From the chandelier

From the chandelier
