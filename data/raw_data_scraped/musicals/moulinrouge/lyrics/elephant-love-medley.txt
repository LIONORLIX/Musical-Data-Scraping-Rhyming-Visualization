Elephant Love Medley


CHRISTIAN:

All you need is love



SATINE:

You're being ridiculous



CHRISTIAN:

All you need is love

Just one night, give me?just?one night



SATINE:

There's no?way cause you can't pay



CHRISTIAN:

In the?name of love, one night in the name of love



SATINE:

You crazy fool I won't give in to you



CHRISTIAN & SATINE:

It's so easy all you have to do is fall in love

Love hurts

All you have to do is play the game

Love scars

All you have to do is

Take on me

No, no, it ain't me

Take me on

No, no, no because you'll be gone in a day or two



I love you always forever

Near or far closer together

Everywhere I will be with you

Everything I will do for you

Love is a battlefield



SATINE:

Don't speak

I know just what you're thinking

So please just stop explaining

Don't tell me cause it hurts



CHRISTIAN:

Open up your eyes then you'll realize

Here I stand with my everlasting love

Need you by my side girl, you'll be my pride

You'll never be denied, everlasting love



SATINE:

What's love got to do, got to do with it

What's love but, a second hand emotion

What's love got to do, got to do with it

Who needs a heart, when a heart can be broken



CHRISTIAN & SATINE:

You're breaking my heart

Suppose I never,

Ever met you Whats love got to do with it

Suppose we never fell in love Who needs a heart

Suppose I kept on singing love songs

All of this music breaks my heart

Yes it breaks my heart, Yes it breaks my heart



CHRISTIAN:

I can't help falling in love with you



SATINE & CHRISTIAN:

I'm all out of faith

This is how I feel

I'm cold and I'm ashamed lying naked on the floor

Take me on

Illusion never changed into something real

I'm wide awake and I can see the perfect sky is torn



CHRISTIAN:

They will see us coming from such great heights

Come down now they'll say



BOTH:

Everything looks perfect from far away

Come down now but, we'll stay



CHRISTIAN:

Cause, love lifts us up where we belong

Where the eagles fly on a mountain high



BOTH:

Love makes us act like we are fools

Throw our lives away for one happy day



CHRISTIAN:

We can be heroes, just for one day



SATINE:

Though nothing can keep us together



CHRISTIAN:

We can steal time, just for one day



BOTH:

We can be heroes forever and ever

We can be lovers just for one day

We can be heroes forever and ever

We can be lovers just for one day



CHRISTIAN & SATINE:

And you can tell everybody

This is your song,

It may be quite simple but, now that it's done

I hope you don't mind,

I hope you don't mind that I put down in words

We can be heroes How wonderful life is

We can be heroes How wonderful life is

We can be heroes How wonderful life is

While you're in the world



CHRISTIAN & SATINE:

I will always love you

And I will always love you

And I will always love you
