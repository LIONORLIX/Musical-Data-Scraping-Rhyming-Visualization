Crazy Rolling


I remember when, I remember

I remember when I lost my mind

There was something so pleasent about that place

Even you emotions have an eco

So mucho space



Mmm

When yo're out there with out care

Yeah, I was out of tocuh

But beacuse I didn't know enough

I just need to much



Does that make me crazy?

Does that make me crazy?

Does that make me crazy?

Possibly



There's a fire starting in my heart

Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark

Finally I can see you crystal clear

So go 'head and sell me out and I'll lay your ship bare



See how I leave with every piece of you

Don't underestimate the things that I will do

There's a fire starting in my heart

Reaching a fever pitch and its bringing me out the dark



The scars of your love remind me of us

They keep me thinking that we almost had it all

The scars of your love they leave me breathless

I can't help feeling



We could have had it all

Rolling in the deep

You had my heart inside of your hand

And you played it to the beat



Baby I have no story to be told

But I've heard one on you

And I'm gonna make your head burn

Think of me in the depths of your despair

Making a home down there

'Cause mine sure won't be shared



The scars of your love remind me of us

(You're gonna wish you never had met me)

They keep me thinking that we almost had it all

(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

The scars of your love they leave me breathless

I can't help feeling



We could have had it all

(You're gonna wish you never had met me)

Rolling in the deep

(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

You had my heart inside of your hand

(You're gonna wish you never had met me)

And you played it to the beat

(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)



My heroes had the heart

To lose their lives out on a limb

And all I remember, is thinking

I wanna be like them

Mmhmm ever since I was little

Ever since I was little it looked like fun

And it's no coincidence I've come

And I can die when I'm done



Throw your soul through every open door

Count your blessings to find what you look for

Turned my sorrow into treasured gold

You pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow



We could've had it all

(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

We could have had it all

(You're gonna wish you never had met me)

It all, it all, it all

(Tears are gonna fall)



Maybe I'm crazy

(You're gonna wish you never had met me)

Maybe I'm crazy

(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

You had my heart inside your hand

(You're gonna wish you never had met me)

But you played it, you played it, you played it, you played it

You played it, you played it, you played it

To the beat
