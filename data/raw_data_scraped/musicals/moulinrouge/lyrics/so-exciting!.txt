So Exciting!


Oh, the story! Ah! Yes, uh



There'll be

Lovers



And singers



And entrepreneurs



Depravity



Ecstasy



And love that endures



Worthy of even the best rock on tour

A tale in the shadows of dear sacr√©-coeur

We! See!

Along the seine

Upon it's filthy shore

The bloated corpses of those

Kill the knight before



But it's a family show

With art both high and lows



A tale of love



And death



And sex



And money



Dancing and away we go



Sweet satine

Who plays our ingenue

A sparrow singing up and

Down each avenue



She wears a thin black dress

And tells a tale of woe

Of pain and loneliness



But that's not all, as these things go!

She's rather sick

With some obscure malaise

No doubt a crueler trick from

Wilder desperate days



But one day

Singing through her pain

The song kicks out the rain

And there he stands

A lover



Yes

One day, everything changes

When she meets a man



A man

Unlike any she has known

He's uh



A ventriloquist



No! He's a matador

Striding across the sands of destiny



No no no

He's a sailor



Yes! A sailor! That's it

A man who has spent his life voyaging across the turbulent seas



He's been searching for a mate

And now it seems like fate

A gift from God above



A love divine forevermore

Their bodies intertwined



But fate has many other things in store



There's a man who already claims her

An evil gangster who runs this town



She's unhappy and no one blames her

The most lascivious racketeer around



He buys her love



He buys her clothes



He's rough but this is all the poor girl knows



He buys her love



There's no escape

But now a triangle has taken shape



And so the sailor, driven mad

Determined to unseat this cad

Swears to risk his life for love

And there's our show

All of the above



A spectacle of savagery



A testament to lunacy



Fun for the whole family



And all of it designed by me



So exciting



The audience will stomp and cheer



So delighting



It will run for fifty years



So exciting



Make them laugh or make them cry



So delighting



And in the end should someone die?



So exciting



Make our dream reality



So delighting



Make it happen just for me



Make it happen just for me
