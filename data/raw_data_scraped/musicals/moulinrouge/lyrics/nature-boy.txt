Nature Boy


There was a boy

A very strange

Enchanted boy

They say he wandered

Very far, very far

Over land and sea

A little shy and sad of eye

But very wise was he

And then one day

One magic day

He passed my way

While we spoke

Of many things

Fools and kings

This he said to me

"The greatest thing

You'll ever learn

Is just to love and

Be loved in return"
