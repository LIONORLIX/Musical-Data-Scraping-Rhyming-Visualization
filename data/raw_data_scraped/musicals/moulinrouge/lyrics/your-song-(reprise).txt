Your Song (Reprise)


Come what may

Come what may

I will love you until my dying day



And you can tell everybody

This is your song

It may be quite simple but

Now that it's done

I hope you don't mind

I hope you don't mind

That I put down in words

How wonderful life is

While you're in the world



And you can tell everybody

This is your song

It may be quite simple but

Now that it's done

I hope you don't mind

I hope you don't mind

That I put down in words

(we can be heroes)

How wonderful life is

(We can be heroes)

How wonderful life is

(We can be heroes)

How wonderful life is

While you're in the world



How wonderful life is

While you're in the...



How wonderful life is

While you're in the world
