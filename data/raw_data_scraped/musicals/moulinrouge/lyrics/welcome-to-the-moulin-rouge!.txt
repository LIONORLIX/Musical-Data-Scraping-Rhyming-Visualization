ZIDLER: (spoken)

For the gallery

It’s peanuts and lager

But for the aristocracy

It’s quail eggs and caviar



Ladies and gentleman

May I introduce

The Duke du Monroth



THE DUKE: (ENSEMBLE:)

(Who do you think you are?)

Ain't nobody dope as me I'm dressed so fresh so clean

(So fresh and so clean clean)

Don't you think I'm so sexy I'm dressed so fresh so clean

(So fresh and so clean clean)



The best things in life are free

But you can keep them for the birds and bees

I got money

(That’s what I want)

That’s what I want

(That’s what I want)

That’s what I want

That’s what I want

(That’s what I want)

That’s what I want

(That’s what I want)



Your love is such a thrill

But your love won't pay my bills

Money don't get everything it's true

What it don't get, I can't use

I got money

(That's what I want)

I got money

(That's what I want)

I got money

(That's what I want)



Why must I live this way?

(Hey, must be the money)



ZIDLER: (spoken)

But there is another Paris, yes?

These are the rats of the latin quarter

The starving artists and thieves of Montmartre

Our own

Beloved

Bohemians!



BOHEMIANS:

Watch out you might get what you're after

Rouge, baby

Strange but not a stranger

I'm an ordinary guy

Burning down the house



My house! out of the ordinary

That's right! Don't wanna hurt nobody

Some things sure can sweep me off my feet

Burning down the house



Here's your ticket pack your bag

Time for jumpin' overboard

Transportation is here

Close enough but not too far

Maybe you know where you are

Fightin' fire with fire



Let’s dance

Let’s sway

Let’s dance

Let’s sway



ZIDLER:

And now it’s time for the breakdown



BOHEMIANS:

Watch out you might get what you're after

Shakedown! Dreams walking in broad daylight

Hold tight wait till the party's over

Burning down the house (burnin’)

Burning down the house (burnin’)

Burning down the house (burnin’)

Burning down the house (burnin’)



ZIDLER: (spoken)

This is where all your dreams come true

You are the Moulin Rouge!



WOMEN:
