The Ballad of Floyd Collins


JEWELL

Deep in the land of the hollows an' creeks,

If'n you git lost you git lost fer weeks.

Listen to the tale of a man who got lost

a hundred feet under the winter frost.



JEWELL & NELLIE

Now Floyd was a reasonin' man;

He knew what he wanted an' he had a plan.

He was jes' as smart as he was brave;

He was gonna find him the perfect cave.



NELLIE, MISS JANE & HOMER

Even Floyd knew somethin' wasn't right.

He was suff'rin' nightmares at night.



ALL

But he didn't worry 'bout what he dreamed;

Things was goin' good or so it seemed.

Went lookin' fer his fortune under the ground...



MILLER

Sure enough his fortune is what he found.
