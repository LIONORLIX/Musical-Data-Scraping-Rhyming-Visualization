The Call


FLOYD

My losin' streak is over, boy! Gonna find my treasure underground!

This cavern's gonna be the biggest attraction roun' these parts,

an' this time folks are gonna pay me to tour her wonders!

They'll be tearin' up the mountain. They'll be campin' in the snow!



If I follow that sound,

I could find what I'm lookin' fer.

It could be glory callin',

callin' me.

Callin',

"Come on, boy!

You kin do it now.

You kin have what you dream on."

Callin',

An' comin' back, an' comin' clear;

Callin' is what I hear.

No more plowin' a hardscrabble field;

I jes' know,

I jes' know it's my lucky day!



All righty, all righty. In we go.



Welcome to Floyd Collins' Sand Cave!

Naw...

Welcome to Floyd Collins' Great Sand Cave!

Not for the meek; You gotta be brave!

Naw...

Everybody welcome!

A fam'ly type of thing to do.

Balloons! Postcards!

Great Sand cave lanterns... and rope?

or somethin'; I dunno.

You got yer magical passageways;

You got yer squeezes an' bends.

My kingdom is open! Come one and all,

My travelin' friends.

I always knew you'd hear my call.

Let me know that you hear me now.

Doh... (Doh...)

Oh...

There's a kind of awe

you cain't catch in a photograph.

S'like a giant jaw, it's callin' me.

Callin',

"Come on, boy!

You kin feel it now.

Like you ain't never felt afore.

An open door..."

So Papa, so you see,

I ain't a crazy cavin' fool, you see!

I always promised to do you right,

an' by the time I get home tonight

all our money worries will be gone;

We will be dreamin' on.

You see,

I'll set you up on a valley farm

where you kin nap under apple trees,

Put up your feet

instead of kickin' my ass!

Oh, Papa!

Your son's a bi'nessman man now!

A so-an'-so!

A muck-a-muck!

A real wheeler-dealer!

Gonna do the fam'ly proud.

My kingdom is open!

It will amaze and astound.

From all 'cross Kentucky,

they'll come to see what I found.

I always knew

that there'd be somethin' in the stars

fer me.

The stars could be so fine...

Doh

Oh ee oh (Doh

Oh ee oh)

ee oh oh (ee oh oh)

Gonna follow that sound!

Gonna find what I'm lookin' fer.

That's my glory callin;

It's callin' me.

Callin',

"Come on, boy!

You kin do it now.

You kin have what you dream on."

Glory,

Oo an' comin' clear;

Glory is what I hear.

No more plowin' a hardscrabble field;

I jes' know,

I jes' know it's my lucky day.

We're so close!



Floyd's a fine boy. He takes after his Pa--

Stubborn as a mule!



But he knows his own mind.

I always knew I'd hear the sound

of voices all around me.

That's the sound of

Glory after all;

That's my call!



Holy... This is it!



Doh-oh (Doh-oh)

Doh-oh (Doh-oh)

Doh-oh oh de doh (Doh-oh oh de doh)

Doh-oh oh de doh (Doh-oh oh de doh)

Doh-oh doh doh ee (Doh-oh doh doh ee)

There ain't never been another man in here...

No Indians, no thrill seekers,

no damn crazy cavin' fools!

Nobody, nothin' till I found 'er.

God showed her to me first!

Floyd...

I'm a-callin';

I'm a-callin'! (I'm a callin')
