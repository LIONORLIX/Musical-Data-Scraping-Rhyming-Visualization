Lucky


NELLIE

"Lucky's what I am.

Ain't no sucklin' baby lamb.

Sure as hell don't give a damn

fer what they think 'bout me."

Lucky, in his way,

buzzin' in my gut today.

Like a choir of crickets singin',

we gonna sell some tickets, singin';

How's about a radio?

How's about a new car, ya know?

How's about a valley farm?

How's about a boy on my arm?

Gonna git a little respect.

Gonna hol' our heads up erect.

Gonna show 'em what we've got;

Show 'em what we will take

and will not now,

An' what we got now,

is a lot now.

No, no, don't you fret;

I ain't tol' you nothin' yet.

We gon' sing a cave duet

inside a magic dome.

'Cause bein' near to him,

I know I'm truly lucky--

Now that I've come home.



MISS JANE

But when dreams talk, Nellie, ya best heed' em. You listenin; to me? Ya learn to doubt things.

Ta don't fool with dreams like that.



NELLIE

Doubtin' never did us any good.

Why you wanna fill us up with doubt?

Doubtin' never did us, no, not one lick of good;

Why don't you jes' help us out,

like you should?

Oh, let us dream some.



MISS JANE

Go an' dream.



NELLIE

Let us scheme a cavin' scheme.

If what he says is there, is there,

an' God is good,

an' fair is fair.

We're sitting on a pile of dough,

Higher than a grain silo!



MISS JANE

Think of all the lofty ways.

Think of all the lazy days...



NELLIE

We could take a trip somewhere...



MISS JANE

Anywhere at all, I don't care.



NELLIE

Git me in a Model A,

I could roll the whole day away, now.



MISS JANE

You don't say now!



NELLIE

Let's pray now:



NELLIE & MISS JANE

Good news 'round the bend;

Trouble days is gonna end.



MISS JANE

Even broken hopes'll mend,

'cause things ain't what they seem.

So



MISS JANE (NELLIE)

lonesome Nellie girl, (Ooo)

my little pearl,

my dreamer:

Dream (Oh, how I love to dream.)

'Cause you've (I've) come home,

and I feel lucky!

Lucky!

Lucky!
