Time to Go


FLOYD

Time to git to work,

git to work.

Comin' back with Homer and all the others;

Git a cavin' banker

to front us the money.

Hey, hey!

Move the rocks,

an' make some trails,

an' smooth the floors,

build the stairs.

An' set up some big signs out on the road!

There's a ticket office,

an' a curio shop,

an' refreshment stand

open seven days a week!



Oh (oh)

Oh ee yo (Oh ee yo)

N-da-n da ee ah dodle oh

(N-da-n da ee ah dodle oh)

Na ya do-ee-a-da do-dle oh

(Na ya do-ee-a-da do-dle oh)

N-da-n da-n-da-n dee-ah ee ah oh

(N-da-n da-n-da-n dee-ah ee ah oh)

Oo (Oo)
