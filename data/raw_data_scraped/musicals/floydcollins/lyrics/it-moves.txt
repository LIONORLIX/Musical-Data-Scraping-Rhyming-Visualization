It Moves


FLOYD

Wonder what she looks like...

maybe a hundred twenty feet high,

sixty feet wide,

two hundred fifty feet long,

best I can picture it.

Ah...

Curvin' back and around so slow,

so big, it moves

when you try to take it all in,

if you try to see it all.

When you think it's gettin' closer,

s'gettin' further away,

grindin' down deeper underneath.

Looks wet,

ev'ry wall looks wet,

meltin' with a snow made a' cream...

Shinin' ev'rywhere with tiny diamonds.

Shine the lantern

an' git all the colors of the world

comin' back,

all the colors of the world.

Ah...

'T aint wet though,

no more than a bone.

Guess it jes' remember

when there was ariver goin' through

centuries ago,

back when there was dinosaurs

an' there was Adam and Eve.

Things happen

an' folks forgit,

but the rain soaks it up

and collects it here;

No tellin' what's on these walls,

layerin' on slow

like a stone history book,

with a couple of sentences 'bout me.
