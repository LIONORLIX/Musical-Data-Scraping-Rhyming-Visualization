This Old Feeling


This old feeling

It's new to me

I'm not sure

How I should be

I'd tattoo my vow

For all to see

To prove how much

You mean to me



A million times said

In as many songs

But before you

I could never sing along

I love you

I do

I love you

I do



This old feeling

It's got me up

I can't believe

My good luck

I'd wait at your door

Till eternity

Because you mean

That much to me
