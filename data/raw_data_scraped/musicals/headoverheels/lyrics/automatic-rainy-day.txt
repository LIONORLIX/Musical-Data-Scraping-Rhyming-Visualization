Automatic Rainy Day


You walk into the room and the temperature falls

The mood disappears

Chased away by the gathering storm

That is here



I look up painted sky full of memories

And this house has no roof to shelter me



It's an automatic rainy day

When I see you

It's the perfect consolation prize

A little piece of blue

It's an automatic rainy day



Just when it feels like the world

Is together and whole

You come around

Dragging your permanent cloud

And the weather turns cold



Hang around for a repeat of history

Falling down in the hole you dug for free



It's an automatic rainy day

When I see you

It's the perfect consolation prize

A little piece of blue

It's an automatic rainy day



When you see the reaction you cause

Does it make you sad?

Do you even realize

That you're such a drag?
