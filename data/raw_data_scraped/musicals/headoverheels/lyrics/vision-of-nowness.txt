Vision of Nowness


There are some things I will never reveal

About the way I think and what I feel

On the surface, smooth, calm and cool

Eyes deep and blue as a swimming pool

And I convince with certainty

No interference will get thru to me



Like a picture that's been painted

And is hanging on the wall

An admired but untouchable

Reflection

A vision of nowness

A vision of nowness



To know the world, complex and wide

To be temperamentally tranquilized

I'll put you on, but envy none

Break you with care to stay free of want

I'm your curiosity

Notorious, you'll never get what you see



Like a picture that's been painted

And is hanging on the wall

An admired but untouchable

Reflection

A vision of nowness

A vision of nowness
