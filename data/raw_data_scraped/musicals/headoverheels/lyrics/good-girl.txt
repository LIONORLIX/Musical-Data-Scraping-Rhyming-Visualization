Good Girl


I'm going be a good girl

So everybody loves me

I'm gonna do what they say

Let them chose the games that we play



Good girl, good girl

Gonna be a good girl

Good dog, good girl

Gonna be a good girl



I'm gonna smile til it hurts

So everybody loves me

I'll bend over backwards

Swallow all my angry words



Good girl, good girl

Better be a good girl

Good dog, good girl

Gonna be a good girl



Good girl, good girl

Better be a good girl

Good dog, good girl

Gonna be a good girl



All I want is for everyone to love me

All I want is for everyone to love me



I'll get down on my knees

I'll say pretty pretty pretty please



Good girl, good girl

Better be a good girl

Good dog, good girl

Gonna be a good girl



Good girl, good girl

Better be a good girl

Good dog, good girl

Gonna be a good girl



Good girl, good girl

Better be a good girl

Good dog, good girl

Gonna be a good girl
