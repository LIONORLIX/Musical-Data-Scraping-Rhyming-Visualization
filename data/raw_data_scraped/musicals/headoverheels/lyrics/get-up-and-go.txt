Get up and Go


If you get up and walk away

Leave the past behind

Go ahead and take a ride

No telling what you'll find



The words you say don't mean a thing

They fly right by my eyes

Lookin the mirror don't look at me

Maybe then you'll realize



(Chorus:)

So get up and go

If you're so tired of moving slow



I was on the inside

Looking out for you

But you're the one to make the change

There's nothing I can do



Now's the time for you to move

Actions shout out loud

So cut the talk and move your feet

Cuz words get lost in crowds



(Chorus)



Quit talking

Start walking now
