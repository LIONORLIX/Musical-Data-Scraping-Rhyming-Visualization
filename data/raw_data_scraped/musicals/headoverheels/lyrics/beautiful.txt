Pamela:

My life is ever so perfect

My life has been a bed of roses

And you might think I'm crazy

So what if I am

My head is full of good things

Enough for everyone



Beautiful

Is all I see when I look at me

Beautiful

Every mother's dream

Day by day

Things just keep getting prettier

Beautiful

What a wonderful life



My life is really quite simple

My life is just what I make it

And you might think I'm seeing

Only things I wanna see

The truth is that I'm being

Who I wanna be
