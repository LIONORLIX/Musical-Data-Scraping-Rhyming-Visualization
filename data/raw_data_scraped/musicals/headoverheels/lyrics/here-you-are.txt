Here You Are


Such a hard life lesson it's so strange

Never trusting things will be okay

But even if you leave

Nothing's gonna change



If you lose control

And burn a bridge too far

No matter where you go

Here you are here you are



Fall down screw up get up run away

I know what's behind the things you do and say

So just look at me

And I'll show you what I see



When you lose control

And burn a bridge too far

No matter where you go

Here you are here you are



The love you seek

The love you own

Is it so fleeting?

Are we really all just alone?

This moment in space and time

Is all that we can know



If you lose control

And burn a bridge too far

No matter where you go

Here you are here you are

When you lose control

And burn a bridge too far

No matter where you go

Here you are

In my heart

Here you are
