Tell Me Why


To think that all these years

I never really knew you.

We sat across this table

And lived a lie.



How stupid could I be?

To look, but never see?



Now tell me why

I wasted half my life

and passed up all me chances.

I thought I could protect you

You let me try.



How selfish and how cruel,

to cast me as your fool.



Now tell me why

I still dream about a day,

I'm dancing at your wedding.

I catch your bride's bouquet,

and wave goodbye.



And you my baby boy,

You're finally on your way.

You'll never see that day.

And, Alfie, nor will I.



I see us sitting out our lives,

two people at a table.

Just like a faded picture,

In some old frame.



You should have told me, Alfie,

Why did you never tell me?



You must have known

I'd love you all the same.
