Confession


Alfie: Bless me Father, for I have sinned

It's been a week since my last confession



Father Kenny: A good sinner can get into a lot of mischief in a week... I'm listening.



Alfie: I swore at my sister once or twice, said some pretty bad words I suppose.



Father Kenny: Is that all?



Alfie: And I thought about killing my supervisor, a number of times

God knows...



Father Kenny: Now you're talkin'.



Alfie: And I slept through your sermon, sorry Father, I don't know where I've been.

The way that my mind keeps wandering, Father... it's a sin.



Robbie: Dear Father, forgive this poor, lonely sinner, Alfie Burne.

He thinks about Robbie all the time, and there's nobody he can tell.



Alfie: I cheated the Dublin bus company by lettin' a girl ride for free.



Robbie: And he's struggling with his Catholic guilt and he's certain he's bound for hell.



Alfie: And I led someone to believe he had a leading role, when really, it's only a supporting one..



Robbie: And he feels like his heart is bursting, Father, how can his life begin?

Another day's going by him, Father, it's a sin... It's a sin!



Robbie: When there's music like nothing you've heard if you know the right jukebox to play,

There are glasses to raise and in praise of surviving the day.

But you're here in the dark in a little box with a fellow who might know less than you,

Then you'll hurry home and lock the locks, another box to climb in to.

For god's sake, man, tell him. Then we'll have a pint.



Father Kenny: Is that all, my son?



Alfie: There's one other thing you ought to know, I've been trying to find the words.



Father Kenny: And what would that be?



Alfie: I... well, I....

No. That's all I have to say.



Father Kenny: Say five Hail Marys, two Our Fathers,

and next time don't take so much time telling me the same old sins, Alfie Burne.
