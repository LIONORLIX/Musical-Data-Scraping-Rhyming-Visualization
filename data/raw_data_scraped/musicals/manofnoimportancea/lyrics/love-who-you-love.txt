Love Who You Love


I'm not one to lecture

How could I dare

Someone like me who's been mainly nowhere

But in my experience be as it may

You just have to love who you love

You just have to love who you love



Your common sense tells ya best not begin

But your fool heart cannot help plungin in

And nothing and no one can stand in your way

You just have to love who you love

You just have to love who you love



People can be hard sometimes

And their words can cut so deep

Choose the one you choose love

and don't lose a moment's sleep

Who can tell you who to want

Who can tell you what you were destined to be

Take it from me



There's no fault in lovin

No call for shame

Everyone's heart does exactly the same

And once ya believe that, you'll learn how to say

I love who I love who I love

So just go and love who ya love
