A Man of No Importance


ALL:

It's a rainy Dublin morning,

sky a leaden gray.

Black umbrellas passing,

just your normal day.



LILY:

A woman is sliding two eggs on a plate,

calling her brother, "Now Alfie, you're late!"



ALL:

and a man is brushing the lint from his vest,

just a man, his uniform dutifully pressed,

now the man remembers a poem that makes his heart year.



LILY:

but his sister says, "straighten your tie"

CARNEY:

and the butcher next door waves goodbye

ALL:

to a man of no importance.



Picture the bus as it moves down a street

past a window of fish and a priest on a bike.

A handful of people with journeys to make,

leaving the ev'ry day world in their wake.



Just a man conducting his bus through the day

but the day is now something more than a day

as the man takes tickets and looks at the girls dressed in blue.



ROBBIE:

Then his driver yells "Alf, you ok?"

ALL:

and the bus lumbers off on its way,

as a man of no importance ends his day.
