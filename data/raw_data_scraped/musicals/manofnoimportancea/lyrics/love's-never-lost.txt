Love's Never Lost


It was on a misty Sunday,

we said our goodbyes

and I still can see her smiling

a tear in her eye

she said son,

"Please remember, no matter the cost

you may travel far but love's never lost."



So I traveled down the high road

and far from Fraley

there were other misty places a boy had to see

by the world, I was taken

by storm, I was tossed

but I told myself that love's never lost.



It was on a misty Sunday

a year to the day

I came knockin' on her cottage

but she'd gone away

she was in down in the churchyard

her headstone embossed

"You may travel far but love's never lost."

You may travel far but love's never lost.
