[LYDIA:]

Mama, I could use some help here

Tired of talking to myself here

Back at home, you don't exist

So here I am in the abyss

Are you really in this place?

It's like the emptiness of space

I could search for all eternity

And never see your face

Help me out

I'm lost without you



Standing

Stuck on this impossible road

No idea which way to go

Whichever path I choose

I lose, you know

And I don't know which way's home

Oohhh

I don't know which way's home

Oooohhh



You always saw life as a game

But since you left, it sucks to play

I'm beaten up and bruised

Confused by rules that alter every day

Where to next?



You left but I'm still standing

Spinning on this infinite road

Terrified of letting you go

No light above and there's no hope below

And I don't know which way's home

Mom, I've got my heart in my hand

Speak to me and I'll understand

One little word to know I'm not alone

And show me the way back home

Oohh

Is there a way back home?

Ooohhhh



The nothingness ahead of me

Is this the end you meant for me?

Every living minute

There's no home without you in it

I'm falling

Quit stalling

Your daughter is calling your name

I've burned all my bridges and games



[LYDIA, spoken:]

Mom?

I don't wanna forget you

I promise

I'm never gonna forget you



[LYDIA, sung:]

I'm gonna go back home

Adam, Barbara, Delia and Dad

It's messy but they're all that I have

I'll make the best of being flesh and bone

Mama, I'm going home

Yeah

Mama, I'm going home

Home

I'm going home!

Mama, I'm going home!
