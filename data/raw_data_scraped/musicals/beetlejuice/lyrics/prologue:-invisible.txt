Prologue: Invisible


[ENSEMBLE:]

Daylight come and we wan' go~



[PASTOR, spoken:]

In times like these, we have no words

We have only each other

Today we come together to mourn the passing of Emily Deetz

Devoted wife of Charles

Beloved mother to Lydia

Scripture tells us

"Sorrow not, for we do not walk alone."



[LYDIA:]

You're invisible when you're sad

Clocks tick and phones still ring

The world carries on like mad

But nobody sees a thing



Whispering behind their hands

Lost for kind words to say

Nobody understands

And everyone goes away



Grownups wanna' fix things

When they can't it only fills them with shame

So they just look away

Is it being greedy to need somebody to see me

And say my name?



Seems when you lose your mom

No one turns off the sun

Folks carry on, that's that

You're invisible when you're sad



[BETELGEUSE, spoken:]

Holy crap, a ballad already?

And such a bold departure from the original source material!
