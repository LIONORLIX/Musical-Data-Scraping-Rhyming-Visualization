The Whole "Being Dead" Thing, Pt. 2


[BEETLEJUICE, spoken:]

Ready? Okay!



[BEETLEJUICE, sung:]

Hi! I'll be your guide

I'll be your G-U-I-D-E to the other side

Don't go to the Netherworld-



[ADAM, spoken:]

Netherworld?



[BEETLEJUICE:]

Did I say Netherworld? Never mind

I'm the B-to-the-double-E-J-F-Q

And Jesus, I can't spell



[MINIONS:]

Hi! He'll be your guide

He'll be your G-U-I-D-E to the other side



[BEETLEJUICE:]

Let's all get naked!



[ADAM & BARBARA:]

No!



[BEETLEJUICE:]

Eh, worth a try

I'm B-to-the-double-E-T-L-E to the J-U-I-C-E

Yeah!



[BARBARA, spoken:]

What is happening?



[BEETLEJUICE, spoken:]

I understand that it's a lot to process



[BEETLEJUICE, sung:]

But the good news is you and your spouse

Died in your own house

That gives you clout

That means the two of you should stick around



Lucky for you I dropped by

Yeah, you seem like nice guys

A little on the Pottery Barn and dry white wine side

As for me, I've been scaring for millennia

I'm the bio-exorcist

Giving houses enemas

Flush out all the breathers

You can breathe easier

Stick with me

I'm like a ghost-zombie Jesus



[MINIONS:]

Ghost-zombie Jesus!



[BEETLEJUICE:]

And I do it for the love of it

Money? Ah, who gives a shit?

I think we're a perfect fit

Come on, let's make out a bit



[MINIONS:]

Yeah!

Dead!



[BEETLEJUICE:]

It's the perfect day to die

'Cause this guy happened to be passing by

To give you control of your soul

For the whole being dead thing



The whole being dead thing!

Oh yeah!
