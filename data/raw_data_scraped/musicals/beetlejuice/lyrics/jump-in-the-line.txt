Jump In The Line


[LYDIA:]

Shake, shake, shake, Señora

Shake your body line

Shake, shake, shake, Señora

Shake it all the time

Work, work, work, Señora

Work your body line

Work, work, work, Señora

Work it all the time



[CHARLES:]

My girl's name is Señora



[BARBARA:]

I tell you, friends, I adore her



[ADAM:]

And when she dances, oh brother!



[DELIA:]

She's a hurricane in all kinds of weather



[ALL (LYDIA):]

Jump in the line, rock your body in time

(Ok, I believe you!)

Jump in the line, rock your body in time

(Ok, I believe you!)



[LYDIA/DELIA (ENSEMBLE):]

Shake, shake, shake, Señora

Ohh

Shake your body line

Work, work, work, Señora

Ahh

Work it all the time



Mama if you're listening

Doesn't this just blow your mind

(Shake, shake, shake, shake Señora)

(Shake, shake, shake, shake Señora)

I was on a mission

This is what I left behind

I'll miss you every day

Seek a little strange and unusual

And you will find

(Shake, shake, shake, shake Señora)

Life, beyond all comprehension

(Shake, shake, shake, shake Señora)

A mess in multiple dimensions

A little unconventional

I know

(Shake, shake)

Mama, I'm home!

(Daylight come and we wanna go home!)

(Daylight come and we wanna go home!)

I'm home!

(Daylight come and we wanna go home!)

(Shake, shake, shake, Señora)

I'm home
