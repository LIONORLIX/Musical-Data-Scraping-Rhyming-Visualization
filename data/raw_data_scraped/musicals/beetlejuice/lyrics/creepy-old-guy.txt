Creepy Old Guy


[LYDIA:]

Way back when

I was just ten

Simple and sweet

Everywhere

Fellas would stare

Out on the street

And I felt used

Kinda confused

I would refuse to look in their eyes

But now I really love creepy old guys!



[ALL:]

We all do!



[BARBARA:]

Gum disease



[DELIA:]

Skin like grilled cheese



[LYDIA:]

Saggy old asses!



[DELIA:]

Saggy old asses!



[LYDIA:]

It's cute and vile-



[DELIA & BARBARA:]

"Hey baby, smile!"



[LYDIA:]

To each girl that passes!



[DELIA wolf-whistling]



[LYDIA:]

They make me blush!



[BARBARA:]

Can't get enough!



[LYDIA:]

Now one of 'em loves me, wants to be mine!



[BARBARA AND DELIA:]

That's right!



[LYDIA:]

Marrying my own creepy old guy!



[BETELGEUSE:]

I'm a creepy old guy!



[LYDIA:]

My creepy old guy, my creepy old guy

I'm so happy I could cry!



[BARBARA & DELIA:]

Girls may seem disgusted, but we're actually just shy!



[LYDIA:]

My creepy old groom!



[BARBARA:]

Creepy old groom!



[BARBARA & LYDIA:]

Play that wedding tune



[LYDIA:]

Hey folks, step aside!



[BETELGEUSE:]

I am older, but I'm glad I waited!



[LYDIA:]

'Cuz here comes the bride!

I am marrying my creepy old guy



[THE OTHERS:]

Creepy old guy, creepy old guy, creepy old guy



[LYDIA:]

My creepy old guy!



[THE OTHERS:]

Creepy old guy, creepy old guy, creepy old guy!



[LYDIA:]

Fix his hair

Get him prepared

For Armageddon



[BARBARA:]

Sure, the groom

Crawled out of a tomb-



[DELIA:]

But hey, hey, it's a wedding!



[LYDIA:]

So dim the lights

Pick up some rice

Say something nice!

It's my day to shine

I'm getting hitched to my creepy old guy!



[BETELGEUSE:]

It's showtime!



[BARBARA & DELIA:]

Creepy old guy, creepy old guy

She's marrying a creepy old guy!



[CHARLES:]

Have you guys seen "Lolita"?

This is just like that, but fine!



[THE OTHERS:]

Creepy old dude, creepy old dude

Our faith has been renewed

Now love is alive!



[LYDIA:]

Wave your baby girl goodbye

I am walking down the aisle

I wanna see a tear in every eye as I pass by

I know that on the outside he's disgusting

And even on the inside, he's disgusting

But I know that this time, I'm makin' it right



[THE OTHERS:]

Making it right, making it right!



[LYDIA:]

With my family by my side



[BETELGEUSE:]

(Oh, this is fun

I don't usually dance but oh well

A dance break on an album!

Amazing!)



O-M-G

Dressed to a "T"

Fancy and formal

I found me a wife

L'chaim! To life!

This is so normal!

I was ignored

But now, I'm adored!

'Cause I extorted, tortured, and lied

Give it up for my underage bride!



[THE OTHERS:]

Here comes the bride

Here comes the bride

God be glorified!



[ALL (INCLUDING BETELGEUSE AND LYDIA):]

I can't believe some cultures think this kind of thing's alright



[LYDIA:]

My creepy old guy

My creepy old guy

Doesn't he deserve a chance at life?



[BETELGEUSE:]

Oh yeah, that's right!



[THE OTHERS:]

Yeah, that's right!



[LYDIA:]

Let's make him alive!

I am marrying my creepy old guy!



[THE OTHERS:]

Guy, guy, guy, creepy old guy, guy, guy, creepy old guy, guy, guy!



[BETELGEUSE:]

I have chills!



[ALL:]

Yeah!
