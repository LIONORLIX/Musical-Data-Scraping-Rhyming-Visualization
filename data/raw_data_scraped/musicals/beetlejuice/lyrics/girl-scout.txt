Girl Scout


[GIRL SCOUT:]

This is it

The day I've been waiting for

Wishing, hoping, working, and praying for

The day my parents have been delaying for years

Ooh, I'm gonna sell some cookies



It's not their fault that they're overprotective

I was born with arrhythmia

My heart is defective

Only takes one shock and I could be dead from the fear

Still, I'm gonna sell some cookies



Hike by hike

Song by song

The Girl Scouts helped my heart grow strong

They'd have my back if anything went wrong with me



Jamborees, soda pop

Distract me from the fact that my heart could stop

From tetralogy of Fallot in my pulmonary artery!

Whee!



When you're a Girl Scout

Everything's gonna work out

Even if you're born with congenital heart disease

And you could be killed by a random sneeze



You're a Girl Scout

Everything's gonna work out

Just gonna ring the bell of this creepy looking house



[LYDIA, spoken:]

Hello, little girl



[GIRL SCOUT:]

Oh, um, yes, um, hi

My name is Sky

And I'm here today to support the Girl Scouts by selling cookies

Four dollars a box

Would you like some?



[LYDIA, spoken:]

Sure



[GIRL SCOUT, spoken:]

Really?



[LYDIA:]

Yeah

What flavours you got?



[GIRL SCOUT:]

I've got chocolate, banana

And oat bran, pecan

Samoas and thin mints

And one that tastes like apple pie



[LYDIA:]

Why don't you come inside?



[GIRL SCOUT:]

Well, we're really not supposed to



[LYDIA, spoken:]

Why?



[GIRL SCOUT:]

Pedophiles



But it's so cold

And you're not mean

And no one gets molested by a gothy teen

So I guess, okay, it's fine



[LYDIA:]

Yeah?



[GIRL SCOUT:]

Alright, I'll come inside



[GIRL SCOUT, spoken:]

It's so dark in here



[LYDIA, spoken:]

Is it? I hadn't noticed



[GIRL SCOUT, spoken:]

Okay... well...

Maybe I should come back another time when your parents are home?



[BETELGEUSE, spoken:]

Boo!
