That Beautiful Sound (reprise)


[BETELGEUSE:]

Do ya' hear that sound?



[OTHER BETELGEUSES:]

[*laughing*]



[BETELGEUSE:]

That beautiful sound



[OTHER BETELGEUSES:]

[*laughing*]



[BETELGEUSE:]

The sound of a super evil plan going down

Being bad rocks

She's in for a shock

As soon as she lifts the lid on



[ALL:]

Pandora's Box!



[BETELGEUSE (OTHER BETELGEUSES):]

I'm the man with a plan

(A man with a plan!)

I live to connive

(He lives to connive!)

And soon I'll be livin'

It's almost a given

That I will



[ALL:]

Soon be alive



[BETELGEUSE:]

I'll be unshackled

Come on, let's cackle

Soon I'll be-



[ALL:]

Painting the town!

Ain't it the sweetest noise around?

That beautiful sound

That beautiful sound

That beautiful sound



[BETELGEUSE:]

That beautiful sound!
