Invisible (Reprise) / On The Roof


[BETELGEUSE:]

You're invisible when you’re me

There's no one to see my truth

If they could look up they’d see

"Hey, somebody's on the roof!"



God, it's mortifying

What's the point of even trying?

'Cus now

I'm trapped with no escape

Banished, disavowed

I vanished like a cloud of dirty hipster vape

[*crying*]



Nobody said life’s fair

Guess they will never see

The demon who isn’t there

You’re invisible when you’re



[BETELGEUSE, spoken:]

Me



Whoa, what have we got here?



[LYDIA, spoken:]

By the time you read this

I, Lydia Deetz, will be gone

There's nothing for me here

I'm alone, forsaken, invisible



[BETELGEUSE, spoken:]

That makes two of us...



[LYDIA, spoken:]

Who the hell are you?



[BETELGEUSE, spoken:]

Can you...

See me?!



[LYDIA, spoken:]

Yeah...



[BETELGEUSE, spoken:]

You can see me!



[BETELGEUSE, sung:]

I'm gonna have a new best friend!
