Barbara 2.0


[BARBARA:]

Look at this stuff

God, it's depressing



[ADAM, spoken:]

You don't like this stuff?

Barbara, this is our stuff...



[BARBARA, sung:]

A shrine to the feelings

We've been repressing



[ADAM, spoken:]

Well, then maybe we should go



[BARBARA, sung:]

Unfinished projects

Meaningless objects

Plans I abandoned or quit

It's the stuff of our lives

And all of it's shit



[ADAM, spoken:]

What? Barbara?!



[BARBARA, sung:]

Books on computers

A "spin-your-own-yarn" kit?



[ADAM, spoken:]

Okay, that... Wasn't as much fun as I thought it'd be...



[BARBARA, sung:]

Home-brewed kombucha

That tasted like armpit



[ADAM, spoken:]

We are not kombucha people

We did find that out



[BARBARA, sung:]

Take it and trash it

Burn it or smash it

We have to adapt to survive

We can be fighters

With fire inside us

We're more than detritus

We're finally alive!



The Barbara you married

She Is dead and buried

Six feet below

And now Barbara the doormat

She's coming back in a new format

Time to let go

Say hello

To Barbara 2.0!



[ADAM, spoken:]

I never even used this...

But then I felt bad that I never used it



[BARBARA, spoken:]

Break it!



[ADAM, sung:]

Barbara, you're right

I think I've been hiding--



[BARBARA, spoken:]

I was too!

I don't even like pottery!



[ADAM, sung:]

Stuck out of sight

Like my un-used aluminum siding



[BARBARA, spoken:]

We are NOT aluminum siding people!



[ADAM, sung:]

Tragic and static

Trapped in this attic

Now Adam is shedding his skin

No more excuses

We're no longer useless

We've got nothing to lose

We can finally begin!



The new Adam is wiser

The old one's fertilizer

It's time to let go

Say hello!



[BARBARA:]

I'm tired of doors

To better or more

We could just walk

But we've done that before

What we cannot ignore

As Lydia needs us



[ADAM:]

That must be the reason she sees us



[BARBARA:]

Adam, I wanna stay

She needs people who won't run away

Friends who don't stop at problems or obstacles

Not a house

But a home



[BOTH:]

Ready, set, let's go!



Time to let go

Cause the new upgraded Maitlands

Are charging out the gates and

They're gonna unload

Say hello...

To Maitlands 2.0!



Maitlands 2.0!

Maitlands 2.0!
