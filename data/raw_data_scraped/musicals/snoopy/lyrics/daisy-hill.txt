Daisy Hill


There is a place where I was wanted

Valued, appreciated, loved

Treated like I was a

Four-hundred dollar fancy French poodle

You know, sometimes I miss that place

The o-l-d puppy farm



Daisy Hill, will you still take me back?

Got nothing to pack

Got no one to leave behind me

Who'd try to find me



Daisy Hill, had my fill of outside

Can't live on my pride

I've tried, but it's hard to swallow

I'm just a hollow show

Just paper-mache

This dog's had his day

I just wanna laze around all day

Like old Doc Traley, and be lazy

Gotta find a way back to...



Daisy Hill, what a thrill I'd be

To look up and see

Your wide open door

And greet each whippoorwill

Howdy!

Smell each daffodil

Purty!

That grow on Daisy Hill, once more



Man what a day!

People have been yellin' at me

Ever since I got up this moring

Sit up, lie down, roll over, play dead

I'm gettin' too old for that

When you're distraught

There's nothin' that will relax more

Than lyin' with your head in your water bowl



And greet each whippoorwill



Chorus:

Whippoorwill

Whippoorwill



Snoopy:

Howdy!

Smell each daffodil



Chorus:

Daffodil

Daffodil



Snoopy:

Purty!

That grows on Daisy Hill

Once more

Ahh!

(Sigh)
