Big Bow-Wow


Wait`ll they see the old dog now,



Stealin` the show,



My mom wouldn`t know her pup!

I`m gonna be a v.i.p.,

Hey, look at me, a v.i.p.,

Thoroughbred sort,

A very important pup!

Three, no!

Two, no!

I`m numero uno!

Are they ready for you know who?

I`m gonna be the big bow-wow,

You`re gonna see `em all cow tow,

Name on my door,

Rug on my floor,

And now no longer `hey step aside runt,`

Flashin` the profile from sidefront,

Now i`m the big bow-wow

Class, yes!

Style, yes!

Out front by a mile, yes!

Look me up in the new `who`s who`!

Gonna be hearing from snoopy,

Pardon, my beagle, but whoopie,

Now i`m the big bow-wow

Bigger than rin-tin-tin and lassie,

Bigger than benji, twice as classy.

Let `em eat steak,

It`s time that i take my bow;

Sandy can throw in the towel,

Snoopy it`s your night to howl,

Now i`m the big bow-wow!
