Great Writer


Maybe they're trying to tell me something

Maybe they're trying to tell me

The short story form is unworthy of my talent

Maybe they're trying to tell me

I should attempt, the novel!



Why not?

I have the time

I got the talent

I got the typewriter

I got the plot!



i - t, it

Sometimes we writers take hours

Finding exactly the right word

It, it, it, it

It was a dark and stormy morning

Packed, flat, trite

It was a dark and stormy evening

It was a dark and stormy night

Night, right!



When suddenly a shot was heard

A shot was fired

When suddenly a shot rang out

Rang out

Inspired



The door slammed

The maid screamed

That's building suspense

When suddenly a pirate ship

Appears on the horizon

Appears?

Appeared

Past tense



While millions of people are starving

While millions of people are starving

While millions of people are starving

What?



Food!



The King lived in luxury

Now to thicken the plot



Meanwhile, on a small farm in Kansas

A boy was growing up

Masterful ol' pup

Brillantly done

You son of a gun

Writing is fun

End of part one



I'll tie all this together later in part two

What's that wonderful smell?

Don't tell me,

Let me guess

Smells like money dipped in honey

Yes, the smell of success

Take a good whiff

Take a good sniff

Pay me a lump that's due

Fame and fortune

Fortune and fame

And now, for part two



A light snow was falling

And the little girl

Small, no

Little, no, small

No, the little girl

Ah, with the tatted shawl

Had not sold a flower all day

Ah, should she be selling matches?

Ah, no, flowers

A violet let's say

She had not sold a violet all day



At that very moment

A young intern was making

An important discovery

The mysterious patient in room

Twenty-three had suddenly awakened

She moaned softly

Could it be that she was the sister

Of the boy in Kansas

Who loved the girl with the tatted shawl

Who was the daughter of the maid

Who had escaped from the pirates

The intern from...

That has a good ring to it

Just see how neatly it all fits together



What about the King?



Stampede, the foreman shouted

And forty thousand head of cattle

Up and down the tiny ramp

Two men rolled on the ground

Rattling beneath the murderous hooves

A left, and a right, and a left, and another left, and right

Isn't this exciting?

An upper cut to the jaw

The fight was over

And so the ranch was saved



There's that wonderful smell called

Ode de happiness

Smells like money

Dipped in honey

Yes, the smell of success

Take a good whiff

Take a good sniff

I stop at one, be rude

Fame and fortune

Fortune and fame

And now

To conclude...



The young intern, sat by himself

In the corner of the coffee shop

Now, zing in the moral old friend

He had learned about medicine

But, more important is

He had learned about life!



The, the, the, the, the,

The end!
