Just One Person


Snoopy:

If just one person believes in you. Deep enough, and strong enough, believes in you.

Hard enough,and long enough before you knew it,

Someone else would think, if he can do it, i can do it. Making it..



Snoopy and patty:

Two! Two whole people who believe in you. And if two whole people believe in you.

Deep enough, and strong enough believe in you. Hard enough, and long

Enough there's bound to be some other person who believes in making it a threesome.

Making it...



Sally joins:

Three....people you can say, believe in me. And if three whole people, why not...



Linus joins:

Four. And if four whole people, why not...



Lucy joins:

More, and...



Charlie brown joins:

More, and more. And when all those people believe in you,

Deep enough and strong enough believe in you,

Hard enough and long enough it stands to reason you,

Yourself will start to see what everybody sees in you.

And maybe even you, can believe in you, too.



Linus (spoken):

Well, as lucy always says, he isn't much of a dog.



Snoopy (spoken):

But, after all, who is?



All (sung):

Don't be the tail if you be the dog. Don't be the bump if you can be the log.

He can wag his tail but he can's wag he. A bump without a log isn't much to be.

Better to be the dog and the log and the kite and the light and the three and bee

And the cow and plow and the drum and plum and the coat and the boat

And the bird and the sky and the tree!



Snoopy:

And the deep blue sea *growls*



All:

Don't be anything less anything than you can be!
