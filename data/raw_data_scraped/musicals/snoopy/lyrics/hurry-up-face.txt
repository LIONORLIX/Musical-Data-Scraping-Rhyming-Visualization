Hurry up Face


Hurry up face

Make it snappy

Come on, come on

Fall into place

Make me happy

Come on, come on



How long can I wait, face?

I'm feeling the strain

That you're running late, face

Is as plain

As the nose on my face

Can you doubt it?

Come on, come on



Get on my case

Hows about it?

Come on, come on!

Show me your heart

Is in the right place

Come on, come on, come on

Hurry up face!



Won't you please try

Try to hurry?

How time has flown

Years flying by

And I worry

I'll be alone

You're falling behind, face

Don't do this to me

My mirror's not blind, face

It can see

That you're losing the race

By a nose

So get out the lead



Hurry up face

On your toes,

Go full speed ahead

Show me your heart

Is in the right place



One of these days, I'll bet

You're gonna catch up yet

So, on your mark, get set

Hurry up face!

Give me a break
