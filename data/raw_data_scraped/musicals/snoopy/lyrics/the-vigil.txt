The Vigil


It's seven fiftythree now,

I'll give him until eight.

Exactly seven minutes,

That's all i'm waiting for

And not one single solitary minute more.



I'll wait a half an hour,

A half an hour's fair.

But after that i'm leaving,

I mean it,i don't care.

That's twentythree more minutes,

Then if he doesn't show

I'm absolutely,positively gonna go.



It's practic'ly eightthirty,

I think i'll wait till ten.

But ten o'clock's my limit,

If he's not here by then...

I'll give him till eleven,

Alright,elevennine,

But elevennine is really where i draw the line.



Of course,he may be flying,

And the frost is on the pumpkim,

And the fog is getting heavy,

So he may be flying blind



One pumpkim patch looks anawful lot like any other,

And this particular path may be hard to find.

Or maybe he's in some kind of holding pattern over newark,

Or he's had to make a forced landing,inpetaluma.



I'll give him until midnight,

I've waited here this long.

Another fifty minutes,

How far could i go wrong.

By giving him till midnight

As long as i'm still here.

My nose is numb,

I think i've caught a chill,

If he doesn't come,and i don't think he will,

I'll never wait for him again until,next year!
