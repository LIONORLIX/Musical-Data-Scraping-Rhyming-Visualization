Prologue



The lights rise on the squalid, stinky bedroom of a friend of Gutenberg



[DOUG, spoken]

The roof is?made?of dirty thatch!

In?the corner, there are rats, gnawing?in stinky cheese

And lying absolutely still in the center of?the?room...

Without?moving...

Is a dead?baby!



[BUD, spoken]

Gutenberg’s friend and?the doctor examine the dead baby



[DOUG (as Doctor), spoken]

Well, we did all we could

I’m afraid your baby... is dead



[BUD (as Gutenberg’s Friend), spoken]

But I gave him this medicine!



[DOUG (as Doctor), spoken]

Them ain’t medicine

Them’s jelly beans



[BUD (as Gutenberg’s Friend), spoken]

Jelly beans?!

But...



[DOUG (as Doctor), spoken]

If only you could read...

See ya



[BUD (as Gutenberg’s Friend)]

Jelly beans, not medicine

If only I could read;

My son, he wouldn’t need... an elegy

Stupid beans! Not medicine!

Oh god, here in this jar...

I can’t read what these are

Damned jelly beans!



[DOUG (as Johan Gutenberg), spoken]

Hello friend

Is there anything Johan Gutenberg can do?



[BUD (as Gutenberg’s Friend), spoken]

Shut up!



[DOUG, spoken]

Friend of Gutenberg sobs like a woman

He cradles his dead baby in his illiterate arms

Blackout!



Act I, Scene 1

Schlimmer, Germany

A German town, full of German things

Like feet and short pants

Gutenberg walks down the dark streets of this medieval burg

And encounters a woman and her daughter on their way to market

They’re carryin’ kraut

Sauerkraut!



[BUD (as Woman #1), spoken]

Oh good morning, Mr. Gutenberg!



[DOUG (as Gutenberg), spoken]

Call me Johan! Johan Gutenberg!



[BUD (as Daughter), spoken]

Hello Mr. Butengerg!



[DOUG (as Gutenberg), spoken]

It’s Gutenberg!

How are you today, little girl?!



[BUD (as Daughter), spoken]

As happy as I can be... considering I can’t read

[DOUG, spoken]

Another woman throws open her shutters to greet the morning

She dumps her stinky chamber pot

And suddenly, the town of Schlimmer is alive

Not alive like a monster

But alive like a town!



[BUD (as Woman #1)]

It’s nice to live in Medieval Germany

In the beautiful town of Schlimmer!

We all get along in perfect harmony!



[DOUG (as Beef Fat Trimmer)]

I’m a beef fat trimmer!



[BUD (as Woman #1)]

Hey!



[DOUG (as Beef Fat Trimmer)]

The beef comes in all white with fat

It leaves a good bit slimmer



[BOTH (as Drunk #1 and Drunk #2)]

We’re just drunks comin’ home from the bar

In the beautiful town of Schlimmer!



[DOUG (as Drunk #1), spoken]

Hey, Gutenberg, ya got any wine?!



[BUD (as Drunk #2), spoken]

Yeah! You’re the wine presser! Tell us where the wine is!



[DOUG (as Drunk #1), spoken]

[BUD (as Drunk #2), spoken]

It’s not over ‘ere!



[DOUG (as Johan Gutenberg), spoken]

Hey, hey fellas! My wine isn’t the answer to all your problems!



[BUD (as Drunk #2), spoken]

Oh yes it is!



[DOUG (as Drunk #1), spoken]

It’s not like we can read!



[BUD (as Drunk #2), spoken]

[DOUG (as Drunk #1), spoken]

Oh, come on guys, let’s not fight!

Here, I’ll buy you a flower from that anti-semitic flower girl!



[BUD (as Flower Girl)]

Here’s a posey you can wear on your lapel

I stole it from a Jew

He cried and he fought and I sent him straight to hell

So now it belongs to you!



[DOUG (as Johan Gutenberg)]
