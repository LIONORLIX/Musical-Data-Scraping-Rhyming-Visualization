[BUD (as Boot Plaque), spoken]

You sure do love biscuits, Young?Monk!

You bet I do!



(singing)



Put ‘em in an oven

And they’re nice and sweet

Put ‘em in my tummy

And they're good to eat

Put ‘em in a shelf

And they're out of reach

Biscuits!



[BUD (as Boot Plaque)]

They taste really yummy

In a time of war



[DOUG (as Young Monk)]

They taste really yummy

Even off the floor



[BUD (as Boot Plaque)]

They taste really yummy

I want some more!



[BOTH (as Young Monk and Boot Plaque)]

We’re not too poor to eat biscuits!

Biscuits!

I want you deep inside of me, biscuits!

Biscuits!

You make me want to dance!



[DOUG (as Young Monk), spoken]

Look at my feet!

Look at my feet!



[BUD (as Boot Plaque), spoken]

So many biscuits!

Gimme a flip!

[DOUG (as Young Monk), spoken]

Flip me!



[BOTG (as Young Monk and Boot Plaque), spoken]

[BUD (as Boot Plaque), spoken]

You've earned yourself a biscuit

Young Monk!



[DOUG (as Young Monk), spoken]

Yummy!



(singing)



You can eat a biscuit

When you're sick in bed



[BUD (as Boot Plaque)]

You can eat a biscuit

When the moon turns red



[DOUG (as Young Monk)]

You can eat a biscuit

When we're all dead!

[BOTH (as Young Monk and Boot Plaque)]

Biscuits and biscuits and...
