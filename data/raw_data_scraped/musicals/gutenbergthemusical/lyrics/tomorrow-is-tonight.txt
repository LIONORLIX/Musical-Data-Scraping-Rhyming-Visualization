Tomorrow Is Tonight


[BUD, spoken]

Elderly patrons may wish to turn down their hearing devices



[DOUG, spoken]

In an actual production

This song would?include?electric guitars...

And lasers



[BUD, spoken]

Scene?eight

The rooftops of Schlimmer

Gutenberg stands, straddling?a chimney

Smoke billows up around his face



[DOUG (as Johan Gutenberg)]

When I got out?of?bed?today

History was a?lot more boring

Then?I thought in a different way

Now the bird of inspiration’s soaring

Look at these hands!

They’re attached to a normal man

A normal man who prob’ly changed your world

Tomorrow is tonight

It’s a history and future fight

Tomorrow is tonight



(no longer in character)



Monk rises from an adjacent chimney

He is surrounded by fire and bats!



[BUD (as Monk)]

Today, I killed the future

Now my badness knows no bounds

My plan unfurled

To trick that girl

Now the bird of inspiration’s on the ground



(spoken)



Splat! Ha!



(singing)



I crushed his dream!

You don’t change the world with a dumb machine!

At least not while this Monk is still in town

Tomorrow is tonight

It’s a history and future fight

Tomorrow is tonight



(no longer in character)

Helvetica is also... on a roof



[DOUG (as Helvetica)]

I feel like a bird

A bird who just destroyed a printing press

A bird who’s in some serious distress

I don’t have wings

That is bad for flying things



[BUD (as Monk)]

Monk’s in command!



[DOUG (as Johan Gutenberg)]

Don’t say can’t when you could say can!



[BOTH (as Johan Gutenberg and Monk)]

You only get one chance to be a star!

Tomorrow is tonight

It’s a future fight



[DOUG (as Johan Gutenberg)]

Tomorrow



[BUD (as Monk)]

Tomorrow

[BOTH (as Johan Gutenberg and Monk)]

Tomorrow is tonight



[DOUG (as Helvetica)]

Tomorrow is...



(spoken)



What have I done?



[BOTH, spoken]

Intermission!
