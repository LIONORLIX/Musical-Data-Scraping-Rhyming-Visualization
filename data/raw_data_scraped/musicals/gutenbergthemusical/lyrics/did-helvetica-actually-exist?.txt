Did Helvetica Actually Exist?


[DOUG, spoken]

Wow



[BUD, spoken]

Always a very emotional moment for me



[DOUG, spoken]

Now, you’re probably sitting there and wondering to yourself

“Did?Helvetica?actually exist?”



[BUD, spoken]

Hmm... probably



[DOUG, spoken]

Yes!

History?tells us that, in olden times

There?were a lot of poor wenches

So chances are, if Helvetica did exist

Gutenberg probably knew her



[BUD, spoken]

Also, her name is a font



[DOUG, spoken]

But now it’s time to meet...

The bad guys!



[BUD, spoken]

Watch out!
