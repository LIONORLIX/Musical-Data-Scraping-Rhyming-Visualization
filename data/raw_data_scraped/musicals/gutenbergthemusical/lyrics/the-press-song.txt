The Press Song


[DOUG, spoken]

Scene four

Gutenberg’s wine press shop

It is very late at night

The clock in the wall says,?like,?2:00 AM probably

Gutenberg?is working at his press



(as Johan?Gutenberg)



Agh, I need a break



(singing)



When I’m at my press

I like?to?leave?my body

Let my?mind roam free

Think?about my day



Somebody died, somebody cried, somebody lied, I ate stew...



And yet... there’s the pain

Of something nigglein’ at my head

I can’t forget...

And yet I can’t remember what the people of Schlimmer said...



[BUD (as Boot Plaque)]

I cannot read!



(as Daughter)



I cannot read!



(as Drunk #2)



I cannot read!



(as Flower Girl)



I hate Jews!



[DOUG (as Johan Gutenberg), spoken]

Yes!

I hear you now, townspeople!

And I understand you!

I feel you inside me!

And I’ve got to do something!



(singing)



Here! I’ll take this clock!

What can it be?!

Can this clock ever teach people to read?!

No it cannot!

It goes in the trash!

Wait!

There might be something cool in the trash!

It’s just an old grape!

That’s not what I need!

Grapes are completely useless!

No! Schlimmer must read!

But what can I do?

All I’ve got’s this grape juice press...

(spoken)



Wait a minute...



(singing)



This grape juice...



(spoken)



...press!



(singing)



I’m gonna take this press

And make it print some words

I’m gonna change a press

Although I know it sounds absurd

I’m gonna take the grapes out

And put letters in

Put letters where ‘dem grapes have been

I’m gonna change this press

And make it print some words



[BUD (as Black Narrator), spoken]

And so, Gutenberg worked long into the night

Changing history to a boogie-woogie beat

You go on, Johan Gutenberg!

Invent that printing press for all of us!

[DOUG (as Johan Gutenberg)]

It’s the first printing press in history

It’s gonna print up books for you and me

It’s a printing press

It’s gonna print some words

Yeah!



[BUD, spoken]

Helvetica enters



(as Helvetica)



Gutenberg!



[DOUG (as Johan Gutenberg), spoken]

Hello!

Look what I invented!



[BUD (as Helvetica), spoken]

What is it?!



[DOUG (as Johan Gutenberg), spoken]

A printing press!



[BUD (as Helvetica), spoken]

Oh, it’s wonderful!

Should we toast?!



[DOUG (as Johan Gutenberg), spoken]

No!



[BUD (as Helvetica), spoken]

Oof!

*Glass breaking sound*

My glass!



[DOUG (as Johan Gutenberg), spoken]

Silly girl!

We don’t make wine anymore!

We make words!



(singing)



Ha!

Now that I’m done

Get ready to read!

This will be going down in history

Remember my face

Now there’s a glimmer in Schlimmer

And that glimmer is me!

G-U-T-E-N-B-E-R... G!
