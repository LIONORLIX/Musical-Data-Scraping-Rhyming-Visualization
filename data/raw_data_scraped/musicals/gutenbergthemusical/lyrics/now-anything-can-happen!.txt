Now Anything Can Happen!


[DOUG, spoken]

Monk and Helvetica just destroyed the printing press

Think about that for a second



[BUD, spoken]

Yeah, let me?say?something

History does not?always happen like we think!



[DOUG, spoken]

History is?not always like they say

In the so-called “history books”!

Also... this may not have happened



[BUD, spoken]

But it could have!



[DOUG, spoken]

Yes!



[BUD, spoken]

Yes!



[DOUG, spoken]

You see

We realized once Gutenberg invented the printing press

There was no more story



[BUD, spoken]

Right! So...

We destroyed it!



[DOUG, spoken]

Now anything can happen!



[BUD, spoken]

Yes!

And what is about to happen

Is the big Act I finale

Now, as many of you already know

A hit Broadway musical always has to end its first act

With a big rock song



[DOUG, spoken]

That’s why we’re about to send you

Rockin’ to the restroom!
