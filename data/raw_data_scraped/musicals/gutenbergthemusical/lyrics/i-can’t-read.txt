I Can’t Read


[DOUG (as Johan Gutenberg), spoken]

You know... I couldn’t make it without you

The wine, I mean



[BUD (as Helvetica), spoken]

Oh... yes, sir

Thank you, sir

Wonderful?sir

(singing)

I?watch him working?at his press

I watch him make?his wine

I stomp the grapes and dream

About the day I’ll?make?him?mine

But I know?that day will?never come

Cause I am too obtuse

I’m too dumb to understand anything but this grape juice



And I...

I can’t read

I can’t read him

He’s all Greek to me

I... I... I... I...

I still need him

Like a grape that needs a squeeze



His brain is bigger than my brain

He can spell and count by twos

He’s so smart and good at stuff

And all I have is boobs

Cause I was raised to milk a cow

And sit upon a stool

And cows, they never ask you much

No wonder I’m a fool

There’s no school



And I...

I am dumb

I am dumbstruck

Every time he says my name

Helvetica Gumishtifel

Helvetica Gumishtifel



Gumishtifel

It’s been my name since birth

But there’s one name I’d trade it for

On this flat planet Earth

So I’ll stay here in my bucket

And one day I’ll be...

Helvetica Gutenberg

Just you wait and see



I...

I’ll be here

I’ll be hearing church bells

Church Bells for us

Us...

Us or we?

Be together

Whichever; us or we

Us or we

Us or we

Us or we

Us... or we
