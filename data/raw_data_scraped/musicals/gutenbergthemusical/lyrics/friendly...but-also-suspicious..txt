Friendly...but Also Suspicious.


[DOUG, spoken]

And that was the opening number!



[BUD, spoken]

And the prologue!



[DOUG, spoken]

We’re just tryna give you a sense of?the?world...

Of Schlimmer!



[BUD, spoken]

Yeah, it’s?a tiny town



[DOUG, spoken]

Yes! The kind of?town where everyone’s friendly...

But also suspicious!

So you might hear something...?like?this!



[BUD (as Barber), spoken]

Well,?if it isn’t?my good friend?Doug Simon

Stopping by for a shave and a haircut!



[DOUG (as a fictional version of himself), spoken]

I sure am, barber!

Hey barber, I brought you a gift!

It’s a cupcake!



[BUD (as Barber), spoken]

Oh, why thank you...

This cupcake is poison!



[DOUG (as a fictional version of himself), spoken]

I can’t stop killing!

(no longer in character)

So, as you can see, Schlimmer’s the kinda town where anything can happen!

And now... we start the story!



Scene two

Gutenberg’s wine press shop

The roof is made of dirty thatch

There are shelves filled with old wine bottles

And Helvetia, a beautiful German girl

With blonde hair and beautiful breasts

Stands in a bucket, stomping on grapes

Gutenberg enters



[BUD (as Helvetica), spoken]

Hello Mr. Gutenberg



[DOUG (as Johan Gutenberg), spoken]

Why can no one in this town read?!



[BUD (as Helvetica), spoken]

We have nothing to read

[DOUG (as Johan Gutenberg), spoken]

I see

That is the problem

I’ll be in my wine pressing room

Pressing wine



[BUD (as Helvetica), spoken]

Here’s your stew

I made it hot and ready



[DOUG (as Johan Gutenberg), spoken]

Well, thank you... um... Barbara?



[BUD (as Helvetica), spoken]

Helvetica!



[DOUG (as Johan Gutenberg), spoken]

Helvetica! Yes, yes!



[BUD (as Helvetica), spoken]

Yes!



[DOUG (as Johan Gutenberg), spoken]

Thank you
