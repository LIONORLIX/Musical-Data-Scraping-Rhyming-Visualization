Like a Million Drunks...


[BUD, spoken]

I... I can’t believe we’re almost to the end of the show



[DOUG, spoken]

I know!

I feel like?my?face is gonna?fall off!

I mean... think about it,?Bud...

The next time we see this show...

We’ll probably be sitting where they are

In the audience!



[BUD, spoken]

Yeah, and... and it’ll be like real dirt streets and...

And real animals and...

And instead of, like, two drunks, there’ll be...

Like a hundred drunks!



[DOUG, spoken]

Like a thousand drunks!



[BUD, spoken]

Like a million!

Like a million drunks



[DOUG, spoken]

What... um...

What was I supposed to talk about here?



[BUD, spoken]

Uh... suicide



[DOUG, spoken]

Suicide, yes



Now, did you notice how in that song

Helvetica kept singing about wanting to kill herself?



[BUD, spoken]

Suicide is never the answer



[DOUG, spoken]

It’s a permanent solution

To a temporary problem...



[BUD, spoken]

Unless you have a terminal illness



[DOUG, spoken]

Then it’s okay

Then you should do it
