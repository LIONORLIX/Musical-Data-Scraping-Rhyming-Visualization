Second prologue



The streets of Schlimmer



[DOUG, spoken]

It is very early in the morning

So early, the dirt streets?are?still covered

With yesterday’s?vegetables

The stage is filled with doom

Also...?fog

Boot Plaque and Daughter meet on the street



[BUD (as Daughter]

Boot Plaque



[DOUG (as Boot Plaque)]

Daughter



[BUD (as Daughter)]

Had a bad dream last night



[DOUG (as Boot Plaque), spoken]

I know!



[BUD (as Daughter)]

There were pigs



[DOUG (as Boot Plaque)]

Were they scary?



[BUD (as Daughter)]

Yes sir

Very scary



[DOUG (as Boot Plaque)]

I had that dream too



[BUD (as Daughter)]

Spits of meat



[DOUG (as Boot Plaque)]

They were turning



[BUD (as Daughter)]

Overdone and burning



[BOTH (as Daughter and Boot Plaque)]

Like symbols in dreams!



[DOUG [as Boot Plaque] (BUD [as Daughter])

Turning, burning, turning

(Symbols)

Turning, burning, turning

(Symbols)

Turning, burning, turning

(Symbols)

Turning, burning, turning

(Symbols)

Black cats!

(Then with ladders)

Thirteen mirrors shattered

By a warlock (By a warlock)



Scary!

(Spooky, spooky, spooky)

Scary!

(Spooky, spooky, spooky)

Scary!

(Spooky, spooky, spooky)

Scary!

(Spooky, spooky, spooky)



Scary things

(Very tragic)

Dreams like this are always...

Magic!

What does it mean? (What does it mean?)



[BUD, spoken]

Now that... was a nightmare



[DOUG, spoken]

People like me and Bud call a scene like that “foreshadowing”

[BUD, spoken]

But Doug, what is “foreshadowing”?



[DOUG, spoken]

Well, I’ll tell you...

Later



Hit it!
