Jo:

I came to New York on a dream

I knew it might take me a while

But all I've been hearing since I arrived

Is "Leave it right there on the pile"



So today I woke up

And decided it's time

Time to achieve

Time to thrive

Time to climb



Professor Bhaer[Spoken]:

Miss. March, tell us what happened



Jo:

Sometimes when you dream

Your dream is just a guess

Sometimes when you work really hard

You don't know

If you'll ever find success



So I grabbed a story to sell

And got ready to raise hell

Then I marched out the door

And headed right for

The Weekly Volcano Press



Professor Bhaer[Spoken]:

Henry Dashwood - now he's a man of taste



Jo:

Dashwod was a fiend

He sneered at my distress

Tossed my story high on a stack

But I was determined I would progress



I said "Sir, I'll wait while you read"

But, alas, he disagreed

So I jumped on a chair

And read it right there at

The Weekly Volcano Press



Professor Bhaer[Spoken]:

You did what?!



Jo (As Clarissa)[Spoken]:

Keep away from me you wretch!



Jo (As Braxton)[Spoken]:

I cannot keep away

Your beauty draws me

Your passion ignites me!



Professor Bhaer[Spoken]:

Oh it's the one with all

the horror in it

The blood bath.



Jo[Spoken]:

That's the one

But I took to heart what you said

And I embellished

I made it better



Braxton (With Voiceover Jo):

I've got to have you



Clarissa (With Voiceover Jo):

I defy you!



Braxton:

I will take you



Clarissa:

Let my by you!

Let go Let go

Let go Let go Let go



Jo[Spoken]:

Rodrigo appears in magnificent splendor!



Rodrigo[Spoken]:

Unhand that women, villain!



Clarissa/Braxton[Spoken]:

Who are you!?



Rodrigo:

I am your destiny

Your bitterest foe

I've come to avenge your plights

Of ten years ago



Braxton:

Ahhh



Rodrigo[Spoken]:

Run to the forest

Run



Clarissa[Spoken]:

I can?t!

The forest is dangerous

My sister went in there and never returned



Rodrigo[Spoken]:

You must risk it

You must take the dark path

Your fate awaits you there



Braxton[Spoken]:

She will never escape me



Rodrigo[Spoken]:

Hurry!



Braxton[Spoken]:

En Garde!



Rodrigo[Spoken]:

Go!

No!



Clarissa:

Ahhh!



Jo:

Dashwood was aghast

But I could not care less

Words I spoke ignited the air

I felt like a publishing lioness

That?s when Dashwood started to shout

And I thought he?d throw me out

But then I persevered and a forest appeared

At the weekly volcano press



[Spoken]

The forest is dark and scary

Clarissa enters, trembling

Fearful of what fate awaits her

She comes to a fork in the road

And stops



Clarissa[Spoken]:

Which way do I go?



Jo[Spoken]:

A Hag appears



Hag:

I can help you choose

But you must make a sacrifice

Give me something dear

Those combs are nice



Clarissa:

Without these combs

What will I be?



Hag:

Perhaps a hag as dull as me



Clarissa:

I can?t



Hag:

You?ll never know your destiny

Unless you give up vanity

Clarissa:

I?ve got to know

Please show me where to go



Hag:

Your fate awaits you

There!



Jo[Spoken]:

The path is perioulous

She avoids swamps

She looses her footing

Her shoes tumble off

The sleeve of her dress gets caught

On a twisted limb

She comes to wild rapids

And can go no further



Clarissa[Spoken]:

How shall I get across?!



Jo[Spoken]:

A troll appears



Troll:

If you want to cross

You must pay me

I?ve the only boat that can get you there alive

I see you wear a necklace

That holds a pretty jewel

My price to get across

Is what you?re wearing while your neck

Oh how its glitter makes me drool



Clarissa:

I?ve nothing left but this

My prospects are so bleak



Troll:

You?ll never know what wisdom is

Until you give up all your riches



Clarissa:

Here ? It?s yours

Now show me distant shores



Troll:

I?ll take you to your fate



Jo:

Sometimes when you dream

Your dreams come true

In extraordinary ways

Suddenly a day can be so amazing

And sometimes when you yearn

You burn the air

And someone else feels the flame

You always knew was there



Knight[Spoken]:

Stop, please!



Clarissa[Spoken]:

I cannot stop



Knight[Spoken]:

Can you not give a tired old

Knight some assistance?



Clarissa[Spoken]:

I have nothing left to give!



Knight[Spoken]:

Give me your time



Clarissa[Spoken]:

My fate awaits me



Knight[Spoken]:

Can you not care for me?

It?s been years since

I felt the touch of another hand



Clarissa[Spoken]:

Then take mine

And take my shawl

Ragged as it is



Knight[Spoken]:

You have now completed your journey

My sword is yours

It will protect you against your enemies

You may now return to the moors

Your fate is in your hands



Jo[Spoken]:

And clarissa raced from the forest

Raced to the moors where she called

?I have returned Braxton

I will free the moors of your tyranny

Fight me!?



Braxton[Spoken]:

I?d always knew you?d come back to me

They always do



Clarissa:

Ahhh!



Jo[Spoken]:

Clarissa thrusts

She parries, she backs up Braxton

And pins him against a tree

She leaps up onto a craggy rock

Her sword swishing and swooshing

Never had she been more determined

She is on fire!

Pity she hadn?t taken dueling lessons



Out of no where, who should return

But the long forgotten

Rodrigo!



Rodrigo[Spoken]:

This is your end villain

I?ve waited a life time to destroy you



Braxton[Spoken]:

Who are you?



Rodrigo[Spoken]:

I am your worst nightmare Braxton



Beth as Rodrigo[Spoken]:

I am -Her sister!



Clarissa/Rodrigo:

Ahh!



Braxton:

Whaaaaa



Jo:

And then Dashwood got on his knees

Crying ?Sell this to me please!?



Professor Bhaer[Spoken]:

Miss. March!



Jo[Spoken]:

Then he ordered four more

Now I?m writing for

The Weekly Volcano Press



Jo/Clarissa/Rodrigo:

I?m ready for destiny

My tresses are curled

I?ll take what is rightly mine

With curtains unfurled

I will not quit I won?t be forgotten

I?ll shine, I?ll dazzle and more

I?m ready to take a bow

I?ve taken a solemn vow

My destiny here and now

I?ll astonish the world!



Professor Bhaer/Mrs. Kirk/Hag/Troll/Knight:

(Sung at the same time)

Sometimes when you dream

Your dreams come true

In extraordinary ways

Suddenly a day can be so amazing

And sometimes when you yearn

You burn the air

And someone else feels the flame

You always knew

was there
