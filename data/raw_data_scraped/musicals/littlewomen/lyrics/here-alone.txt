Here Alone


Marmee



Write a letter, be inventive

Tell you everything is fine.

Be attentive to the distance

Send my love with every line

Every word should bring you closer and

Caress you with it's tone.

Nothing should remind you

That I am here alone

I can't tell you what I'm feeling.

I can't talk about the war

How the peeling of the church bells

Brings the battle to our door

I don't know which part is harder

What I know or what's unknown

Or raising little women

when I am here alone

Counting days, Praying for news

Is this the life

We meant to choose?...

Do you know how much I miss you

At this hour of the day?

How I wish you were the twilight

Come to take my fears away

Can I manage four young women?

I'm not certain I know how

Will I be there when they need me?

Or do I fail them here and now?

I wish that you were with me

Wish that I could bring you home

The nights seem so much longer

Now that I am here alone.
