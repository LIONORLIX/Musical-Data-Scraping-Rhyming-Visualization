Operatic Tragedy


JO

Spoken: 'It's a mean and stormy night

The moors are bleak and bloody.

Thunder claps! Lightning Strikes!

The fair Clarissa, her clothes in disarray,

races across the wild coastal heath-'



Now she stops!

Now she runs!

Will she escape?

Will she be caught?



Spoken: With bold determination,

the villainous aristocrat Braxton Prendergast, lurches for her-



There's no escape.

She's but a child.

And yet she turns to fight

With eyes ablaze!

This noble girl meets his gaze,

Unafraid.

She will not be defiled!



Clarissa/ Jo

Spoken: Keep away from me you wretch!



Braxton/ Jo

Spoken: I cannot keep away. Your beauty

draws me. Your passion ignites me.



I've got to hold you.



Clarissa

I defy you!



Braxton

Got to have you.



Clarissa

Let me by you!



Braxton

Come close-



Clarissa

Don't come too close-



Braxton

Come close-



Clarissa

Don't come too close-



Braxton/ Clarissa

So close, so close to me.



Braxton

Spoken: I'll have her. And the mother too.



Jo

Spoken: And at that moment, Rodrigo appears in magnificent splendor!



Rodrigo/ Jo

Spoken: Unhand that woman, villain!



Braxton

Spoken: Who are you?



Rodrigo/ Jo

I am your destiny,

Your bitterest foe.

You stole what was rightly mine

Ten long years ago.

You left me cold, alone and forgotten,

Now I'm back to settlet he score-!



Professor Bhaer

Spoken: Miss March!
