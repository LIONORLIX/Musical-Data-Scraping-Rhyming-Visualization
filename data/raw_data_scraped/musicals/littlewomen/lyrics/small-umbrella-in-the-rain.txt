Small Umbrella in the Rain


Professor Bhaer

(spoken)

Jo. We are not at all alike. We have our differences. May I be blunt?



Jo

(Spoken)

Be blunt. By all means.



Professor Bhaer

I think perhaps it looks like rain



Jo

The sky gets bluer by the hour



Professor Bhaer

The water falls in little drops



Jo

That?s why it?s called a sun shower



Professor Bhaer

Ah, not it stops



Jo

(spoken)

You were about to be blunt?



Professor Bhaer

If I say rain, then you sun.

If I say yes, then you say no.

It seems before we start, we?re done.

We even argue at ?hello?

If I say, share with me

This small umbrella



Jo

I say who cares if we get wet?



Professor Bhaer

We are as different as the

Morning and the night



Jo

No, we?re as different as the

Winter and the spring



Professor Bhaer

We always seem to fight



Jo

We disagree on everything



Professor Bhaer

And yet?

You make me smile,

You make me laugh,

You make me care.

How can I explain?

Inside my heart

I feel a pain

When you?re not there.

Though we?re not at all alike,

You make me feel alive.

If we had that in common,

That one small thing in common,

Love could be like a small umbrella,

In the rain.

When people discover passion,

They?ve come upon something rare.

This fervor they have in common,

Will shelter them anywhere.

Though the rest may be rough,

With such passion to share,

I think we have more than enough-

Enough to make a marriage,

If we dare.



Jo

(Spoken)

You are proposing?



Professor Bhaer

(spoken)

No. Yes! Yes! I do not mean today.

Or tomorrow, or even next month.

In a year maybe, two years even.

I am a patient man.



Jo

I won?t be sweet, won?t be demure



Professor Bhaer

This I prefer, this I adore



Jo

I?ll speak my mind, you can be sure



Professor Bhaer

I?ll be enchanted to the core.



Jo

If I say, let me share your

Small umbrella.



Professor Bhaer

I?ll say, who cares if we get wet?



Jo

We?ll be as different as a

Husband and a wife



Professor Bhaer

No, we?ll be as different as a

Woman and a man



Jo

We?ll fight our way through life.



Professor Bhaer

We?ll disagree the best we can.



Jo

And yet?



Jo/Professor Bhaer

You make me smile,

You make me laugh,

You make me care.

How can I explain?

Inside my heart

I feel a pain

When you?re not there.

Though we?re not at all alike,

You make me feel alive.



Jo

Yes, we have that in common



Professor Bhaer

That one small thing in common



Jo/Professor Bhaer

Our love is like a small umbrella

In the rain
