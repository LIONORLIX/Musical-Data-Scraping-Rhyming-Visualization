More Than I Am


Mr. Brooke

Meg, if you could find it in your heart

If you could love me as I love you

If only you'd care if we are apart

Then I would be rich

I would be wise

I would be worth more than I am



Meg

Wait for your return

Wait while you're at war



Mr. Brooke

If you will wait while I am gone

If you'll imagine me here with you

If only you'd care if I carry on

Then I could be strong



Meg

Why must you go?



Mr. Brooke

I could be brave



Meg

Don't be too brave



Mr. Brooke

I could more



Meg

Only come home



Mr. Brooke

More than I am

If you will say you love me enough to marry me

I will come and love you



Meg

Swear you'll come home



Mr. Brooke

For all of my life

And I will be more

More than I am

Say yes, make me more than I am



Meg

I'll marry you tomorrow

I'll marry you today

Come home and I will love you for all of my life



Both

I swear to you now with all my heart

I swear I will love you as you love me

>From this moment on

Though we'll be apart



Meg

I will be more



Mr. Brooke

I will be more



Meg

More than I am



Mr. Brooke

More than I am



Both

With you I will be more than I am
