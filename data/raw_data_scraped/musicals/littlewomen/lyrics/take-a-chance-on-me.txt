Take a Chance on Me


Laurie:

I know I have no right.

But sometimes late at night.

I watch you in the attic.

Passing back and forth like a maniac.

I?ve never met a girl like you-

Anyone at all like you.

This is very nice.

Such a lovely party.

The music sounds so thrilling.

It makes a person feel like dancing?



Laurie: (spoken)

I?m very good! I won a medal for dancing at school.



Jo: (spoken)

I don?t dance. Besides, I have a patch on the back of my dress.



Laurie: (spoken)

A patch? Let me see!



Jo: (spoken)

No! No!



Laurie: (spoken)

I like it. That patch could start a whole new fashion.

Dance with me tonight and I guarantee by next

spring, every girl in Concord will be wearing a patch on her dress!



We could do a hundred things,

Do anything you please.

We could fly on golden wings,

Across the seven seas.

I?ll bet you?ll get a camel through an needle,

If you?ll take a chance on me?



Jo: (spoken)

You?re a lunatic!



Laurie:

We could catch a thousand stars,

And stand them on a pin.

We could leave from here to Mars,

And make the planet spin.

If you want to do all the things you?ve ever dreamed of-

Come on! Take a chance on me?

We could be such friends,

Friends are never lonely.

All I know is books-

Books are solitary.

But I?d see you everyday,

How you live in your own way,

And you make me want to dare...

To take a chance on you!



Jo: (spoken)

All right. We could box if you like.



Laurie: (spoken)

You box?



Jo: (spoken) You ready?



Laurie: (spoken)

I should warn you?I won a medal for boxing at school.



Jo: (spoken) Hm.



[MUSICAL INTERLUDE]



Jo: (spoken)

Is that how you win medals?



Laurie:

We could live a million dreams,

But only if we dare?

We could go to such extremes,

There?s so much we could share!

We?ll circle the world,

Doing all we ever dreamed of!

And we?ll live in our own way,

And I?ll see you every day!

We?ll be the best of friends,

When you take a chance on me!
