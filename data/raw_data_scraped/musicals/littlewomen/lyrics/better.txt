Better


Professor Bhaer

Spoken: Miss March, I spoke my mind,

as you spoke yours. Obviously, it was

not appreciated on either side.



Jo

Spoken: Obvioulsy! My stories were a great success in Concord.



Better?

Better than what?

Better than this dazzling plot?

Better?

This story will be my 'King Lear.'



Each phrase is better.

Better than him.

Better! Even my smallest whim

Is better!

How can he miss what's so clear?

How can I do better than what's

Already here?



How can what he said to me be true?

If I don't succeed, what will I do?

Turn around, go back to Concord?

Leave New York behind

Unconquered? No!

How dare he make me doubt

The way I feel?

Dobt that each thrilling page

Is who i am?



Aren't these words alive

With passion,

Vivid as my attic where it all began?



Amy

Spoken: Jo! Jo, the girls at school were horrible to me! Charlotte Fenton

said my dress is ragged and my

nose is flat!



Meg

Spoken: Jo, I hate being a governess. I should

be meeting eligible young men.



Amy

Spoken: It's going to be a dismal Christmas:

what with Father away and no money

for presents.



Beth

Spoken: Meg, Amy- Jo has a surprise for us.



Jo

Or was I better, better when

I was home?
