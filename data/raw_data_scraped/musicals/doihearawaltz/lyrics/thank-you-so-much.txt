Thank You So Much


LEONA

Thank you so much, sir,

Wasn't it fun?

No reason at all to cry.

Let's keep in touch, sir,

Now that it's done;

You can't say we didn't try.

Did it go by so quickly?

Really, it seems a crime.

But thank you so much

For something between

Ridiculous and sublime.

Thank you for such

A little but lovely time.



RENATO

Thank you so much,

Ma'am, somehow I trust

We'll think of this now and then.

Let's keep in touch,

I wish we were just

Beginning to meet again.



LEONA & RENATO

Did it go by so quickly?

Really, it seems a crime.

But thank you so much

For something between

Ridiculous and sublime.

Thank you for such

A little but lovely time.
