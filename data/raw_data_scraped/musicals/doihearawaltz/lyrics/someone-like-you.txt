Someone Like You


I waited for someone

But somehow I never had looked for

Someone like you.

My chances were many

But I was too clever,

I wanted someone like you.

uddenly the door!

Wonderful surprise!

Wonderful and more.

Before my eyes.

I thought that surprises

Were over forever,

And then came

Someone like you.
