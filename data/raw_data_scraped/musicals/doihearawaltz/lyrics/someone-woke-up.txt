Someone Woke Up


LEONA

Someone woke up one incredible day,

Had an idea and was prompted to say:

"Let's build a city... where should it be?

How about the middle of that sea?"

Someone drew plans like a set for a stage,

Someone spilled colors all over the page,

Then they built it -- Cookie, you know why?

Just so Leona could come here and cry.



Some people cry at hellos and farewells,

Some people cry at nostalgia with bells,

Some cry at weddings, some at the moon,

I cry promptly Mondays at high noon.

Some people cry at Vienna or Rome,

This one is mine, Cookie, this one is home.

Look, they even painted the damn sky

Just so Leona could come here and cry.



Some people cry when they see their old pals,

Me, I'm a sucker for chimes and canals.

Look, they even painted the damn sky

Just so Leona could come here

And stand like a lump

Dripping wet with no shoes on

At noon on a Monday

And cry.
