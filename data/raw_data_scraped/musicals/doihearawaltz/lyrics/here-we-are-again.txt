Here We Are Again


FIORIA

How sudden the fall of evening,

This soft seductive light.

The joining of hands at evening

Anticipates the night.

Is it well with you?



LEONA: Oh, yes, thank you.



EDITH

Young lovers come out at evening

To primp and preen and fuss.



LLOYD

Young lovers come out at evening...



EDITH, LLOYD

Reminding us of us.



FIORIA

Is it well with you?



EDITH: Lovely!



LEONA

Here we are again,

Sharing things together,

See the pretty people,

Feel the pretty weather.

We don't have to say much,

We're so much of a kind.

Isn't it a marvel

How we read each other's mind?

Here we are again,

What'll we do later?

See the pretty people,

Shall we call the waiter?

Pretty people, two by two,

That's as it ought to be.

And here we are as usual:

I and me.



JENNIFER

Look at the evening.



EDDIE

Yeah, it's lovely.



JENNIFER

Beautiful evening.



EDDIE

There's a breeze.



JENNIFER

How I love evening!



EDDIE

I suppose so.



JENNIFER

Don't you love evening?



EDDIE

Honey, please!



FIORIA

Is it well with you?



(No answer.)



LEONA

Here we are again,

Botching things together.

Gaping at the people,

Talking to the weather.

We don't have to say much

To make the job complete.

Isn't it a marvel

How we do it with our feet?

Here we are again,

Time to call the waiter.

Maybe we should ask him

What he's doing later.

Pretty people, two by two,

Do as they've always done.

And here we are as usual:

One by one.



Here we are again

With our friend the waiter.

Gone the pretty people,

And it's getting later.

Pretty people, two by two,

Do as they've always done.

And here we are at home again:

One by one.
