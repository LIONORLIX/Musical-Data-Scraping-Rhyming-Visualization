This Week, Americans


FIORIA

Last week the Germans,

You can keep the Germans,

Always cheap, the Germans,

Even on a trip.

Sweet? Not the Germans,

Sweat a lot, the Germans,

Full of smiles, the Germans,

Don't expect a tip.

But this week Americans,

Open-armed Americans,

I am charmed, Americans,

Welcome, welcome, welcome,

I love Americans,

The pleasure is mine.

Remember, no breakfast after half-past nine.



Next week the English,

You should see the English,

All the tea, the English,

Thirsty, I suppose.

Good eggs, the English,

Rotten legs, the English,

All those teeth, the English,

Rows and rows and rows.

But this week Americans,

More than kind Americans,

Much-maligned Americans,

Welcome, welcome welcome,

I love Americans,

And my home is yours.

I can't be responsible, so lock your doors.



Then come Parisians,

Full of food Parisians,

Always rude Parisians,

Every one a sneak.

Perfumed Parisians,

Over-groomed Parisians,

Middle-class Parisians,

Far more cheek than chic.

But this week Americans,

Generous Americans,

Never fuss, Americans,

Welcome, welcome, welcome,

Thank you, Americans,

For coming to stay.

How charming, my guests are from the U.S.A.



No alcoholic Swedes,

No double-dealing Russians.

No Spaniards with their beads

And their deafening discussions.

No narcissistic Greeks,

They're worse than the Italians,

With overblown physiques

And St. Christopher medallions.

No millionaire Brazilians

Who somehow never pay,

I much prefer the millions

From the U.S.A.
