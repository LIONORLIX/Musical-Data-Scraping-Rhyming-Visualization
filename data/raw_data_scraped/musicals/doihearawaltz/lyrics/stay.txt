Stay


RENATO

I am not the dream come true,

But stay.

Not perfection, nor are you,

But stay.

Who is brilliant? Who is witty?

Am I handsome? Are you pretty?

Throw the dream away,

Stay and stay and stay.



Did you wish a Duke at least?

A Duke you should have.

If I could have been a Duke,

For you I would have.

All the things you should have

I cannot supply you.

I would give you...

I would buy you...



I am not the dream come true,

But stay.

No one is the dream come true,

But stay.

Here with every special feeling,

No denying, no concealing,

Throw the dream away,

Stay and stay and stay

And stay and stay.
