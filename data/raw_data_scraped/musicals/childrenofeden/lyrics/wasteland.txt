Wasteland


STORYTELLERS

And the man walked through the acrid ash of heaven

To the smoldering tree destroyed by Father's wrath

And he carved from it a staff

To lean on in the aftermath



And the man and woman went out from the garden

And when they turned to look, the pathway back was gone

So they turned and set their eyes

To the land that lies beyond...



Red rock and outcrop stone

And the sun glares off a bleaching bone

There's no comfort or softness here

There's only the wasteland



The land of the hunter, the stalker, and the skinner

Where you're either the diner or the dinner

And the line between man and beast keeps getting thinner

In the wasteland



In the wasteland, the land laid waste

Fruit of knowledge has a bitter taste

But the bliss of ignorance can never be replaced

It's lost in the wilderness



And there came a day, in a chilly rain

A child was born in sweat and pain

But they loved him still and they called him Cain

Of the wasteland



In the wasteland, the land forlon

Two more years and one more morning

There's another cry heard and another boy born

To be lost in the wilderness



Heat-baked and dust storm-driven

And one false step stays unforgiven

And all that you know is you weren't made to live in

The wasteland
