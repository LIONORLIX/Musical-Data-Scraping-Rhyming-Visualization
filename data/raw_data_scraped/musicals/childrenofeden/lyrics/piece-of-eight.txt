Piece of Eight


STORYTELLERS

And Noad and his fmaily worked from sun to sun to sun

Till the day before the prow he stood and said



NOAH

With this peg of gopher wood your ark oh Lord is done



STORYTELLERS

With one final peg of gopher wood

The ark at last

Was done



bum ba bum bum ba bum bum ba ba bum ba ba ba bum



An Noah called to his servant girl

Yonah was her name

He had always treated her kindly Though she wore the mark of shame

As the daughter of the tainted race

She wore the mark of Cain



And she came bowed the servant girl

With the mark upon her head

And she asked



YONAH

What do you wish my Lord?



STORYTELLERS

And this is what he said

He said



NOAH

Yonah, lay the table

For tonight we celebrate

For tonight instead of seven places

Tonight there will be eight



STORYTELLERS

For this was the night the youngest son

Japeth was his name

Would bring to dinner his wife to be

And his choice proclaim

And the empty chair was meant for her

The girl to be his wife

Who would journey with him on the ark

To a post deleuvian life

He said



JAPETH

Yonah, lay the table

Dont forget the extra plate

For tonight instead of seven people

The family will be eight



STORYTELLERS

First came Noah and his Wife

In a bright and merry mood

Eager to meet their daughter in law

And share their home and food

And add her to their brood

Next there came the brothers two

Ham and Shem

And the daughters of the race of Seth

They chose to marry them

Their beautiful wives from the race of Seth they brought along with them



NOAH, MAMA, HAM, SHEM, JAPETH, APHRA, AISHA

Oh Father for all we have recieved

We thank you

Once more we gather in the dying light



YONAH

Oh Father

For all i have recieved



NOAH, MAMA, HAM, SHEM, JAPETH, APHRA, AISHA

Once more we pray you Father

Bless us tonight



YONAH

I thank you



STORYTELLERS

The courses came and the minutes past

And the girl did not appear

Till Noah turned to Japeth

And he said



NOAH

My Son i fear



STORYTELLERS

But Japeth laughed and laughed some more

And told them all



JAPETH

She's here!



STORYTELLERS

Well by now you've guessed what happened next

For it's quite a familiar fable

He went to Yonah the servant girl

And lead her to the table

He said



JAPETH

Yonah, join the table

Come and sit here at my side

For it's you i love best in all the world

And you shall be my bride

Yes it's you i love best in all the world

And i want you for my bride



STORYTELLERS

He brought Yonah to the table

And he did not hesitate

Though his Father said to wait

And his Mother was in a state

And the Brothers and Wives felt the shock of their lives

And they all of them dropped their forks and knives

As they all could calculate

The family was eight

One,two,three,four,five,six,seven

Eight!
