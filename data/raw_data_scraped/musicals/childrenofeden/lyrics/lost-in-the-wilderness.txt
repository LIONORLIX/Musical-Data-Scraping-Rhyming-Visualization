Lost in the Wilderness


ABEL



Here we are your grateful children

Please accept our sacrifice

May you hear us and forgive us

Bring us back to paradise



CAIN [over ABEL]



All these years of this cruel joke

The best harvest going up in smoke

Praying for a future from these silent stony shelves

How much  more of this must we take

This is the day we will make a future for ourselves



ABEL



But CAin if it's God's will...



CAIN



Is it God's will or have we all been conned

Brother we will never know

We will never grow

If we never go

Beyond



I never made this world, I didn't even lose it

And I know no one said fair

But they had a garden once

They had the chance to choose

They gave it away including my share



And now we're lost in wilderness

Lost,crying in the wildreness

And if anyone's watching it seems they couldn't care less

We're lost wilderness



You follow all the rules

You swallow the stories

And every night you wish on a star

Dreaming your day will come, trusting in allegories

And every morning boy look where you are



Lost in the Wilderness

Lost, lonely, dying in the wilderness

With no chance of living boy, until you confess

You're lost in the wilderness



Did you ever watched the eagle fly to the sun

And wondered how he got to be so free

If you ever have you know your journey's begun

Hey what you got to lose boy, when already we are

Lost in the wilderness



And where we are headed boy, I couldn't guess but

Off we go without a warning

Running as we hit the ground

Where our future lies before us

Where our hearts are outward bound

Till one bright and distant morning

We may stop and look around

And there in the wilderness

Finally we'll be found!
