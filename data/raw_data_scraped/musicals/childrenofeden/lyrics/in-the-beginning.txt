In the Beginning


Japheth & Yonah:

This step is one again our first

We set our feet upon a virgin land

We hold the promise of the earth

In our hands...



Add Noah & Mama:

No flood from heaven comes again

No deluge will destroy and purify

We hold the fate of man and men

In our hands...



Add Family:

Now at this dawn so green and glad

We pray that we may long remember

How lovely was the world we had

In the beginning...



All except Father:

Of all the gifts we have received

One is most precious and most terrible

The will of each of us is free

It's in our hands



And if one day we hear a voice

If he should speak again, our silent father

All he will tell us is the choice

Is in our hands



Our hands can choose to drop the knife

Our hearts can choose to stop the hating

For ev'ry moment of our life

Is the beginning...



Father:

There is no journey gone so far

So far we cannot stop and change direction

No doom is written in the stars



All except Father:

It's in our hands...



All:

We cannot know what wil occur

Just make the journey worth the taking

And pray we're wiser than we were

In the beginning

It's the beginning

Now we be...



Children of Eden

Grant us your pardon

All that we leave to you

is the unknown



Children of Eden

Seek for your garden

You and your children to come

Some day to come home home...
