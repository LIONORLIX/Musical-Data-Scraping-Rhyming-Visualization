World Without You


ADAM



Oh my Father, Lord and Creator

You know that half my heart is yours

All that you gave me I can't repay you

If I betray you, I'll break in two

How could I live in a world without you



FATHER



You'll stay here Adam be my son forever..



ADAM



But oh my life's partner, my wife my lover

You know that half my heart is yours

Each I see you, you fill my spirit

Just knowing you're near, it makes the day new

How could I live in a world without you



Oh Father please don't choose

Either way it's more than I can bear to lose

Either way it's ripping out my heart

This choice is tearing me apart



FATHER



You see what have done

Pain has come into the garden

Where there is choice there is pain

Make this one choice my son

Choose not to eat this fruit

And you will never have to make a choice again



ADAM



Oh Eve what would you give

If this day you could relive

Would you let the apple go uneaten?



EVE



No, I cannot bear this pain

But I would not go back again



ADAM



Oh my garden, all peace and beauty

I know that all my heart is yours

I want to stay here, stay here forever

Father forever, I cannot leave

But Eve I don't know what else to do

How can I live...

I cannot live...

I will not live..

In a world without [long pause]

You
