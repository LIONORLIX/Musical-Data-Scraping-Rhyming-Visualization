Lost in the Wilderness (Reprise)


DID YOU REALLY THINK I’D BE HERE, CHANTING A PRAYER,

TILL YOU FIN’LLY DEIGNED TO REAPPEAR?

NOTHING YOU CAN SAY COULD STOP ME HEADING OUT THERE.

WHEN ALL I KNOW ABOUT YOU

IS YOU LEFT US HERE,

LOST…

ABANDONED IN THE WILDERNESS.

SO — YOU CAN KEEP YOUR BRIBES AND TEMPTATION.

I’M GONNA FIND MY OWN DESTINATION

(Scoops up the bundle and slings it over his back)

OUT IN THE WASTELAND,

WITH NOTHING TO GUIDE ME

BUT THIS BURNING INSIDE ME —



ABEL

Don’t go, Cain!



CAIN

THE SPARK OF CREATION!



ABEL

Cain!



He’ll come back.



FATHER

Will he?



ABEL

He’s got to come back…



FATHER

Abel. Say nothing of this to your father and mother. I wasn’t here. You don’t know

why Cain ran away. This is our secret.  Do you understand?



ABEL

Yes, Grandfather.



FATHER

Promise?



ABEL

Promise.



FATHER

ABEL, MY GRANDSON,

YOU ARE THE FUTURE.

ALL MY HOPES LIVE IN YOU.

DON’T BREAK MY HEART…





EVE has joined ABEL.  THEY watch ADAM as he stands gazing out

over the hills, shielding his eyes with his hands)



ADAM

Cain! Cain!



ABEL

He’ll be all right, Papa.



ADAM

And what if Father finally comes for us while he’s gone? What then, Abel?



What then?



ABEL

I don’t know.



ADAM

Damn him, anyway!
