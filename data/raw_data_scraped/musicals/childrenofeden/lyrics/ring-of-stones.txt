Ring of Stones


CAIN

Abel! Momma! Poppa!

Come, Abel, quick, Abel, wait 'til I show you what I found!



ADAM

Cain! Before you say another word--



CAIN

No, Poppa, now Poppa, it's a thing that will astound you!

When I show you what I found, you won't believe!



ADAM

Eve!



STORYTELLERS

Over river wide and mountain tall

They traveled far beyond the waterfall

To a place and a day that would change them all

In the wasteland



ABEL

What are they?



CAIN

Stones! It's a ring of giant stones!

All of my life I think it's this I've been seeking

Pent up inside me like an underground spring

Finally a future, finally an answer

Written in a ring of stone

Finally proof of what I've always known:

We are not alone

Damned we may be

But we are not alone



EVE

All of a sudden, I can feel the old tingling

The urge to question, the itch to explore

I feel it once more



CAIN

Stones the size of giants

In a perfect circle



EVE

What could be their purpose

What could be their meaning?



CAIN

In a perfect circle



EVE

How could they have raised them?



ABEL

Must have taken hundreds



CAIN

Stones the size of giants



ABEL

How long have they been here?

Could we find the people?



CAIN, EVE, AND ABEL

Think about their knowledge, think about their science



CAIN

Think about their strength and skill

Scary they may be but still

I will never rest until



CAIN, EVE, AND ABEL

We have found these strange, bewildering

People who would build a ring of giant stone



CAIN

All of my life I think it's this I've been seeking

We are not alone



ADAM

The rain will be here soon

We'd best get back to the shelter of our glen



CAIN

But...what about these people?



ADAM

We will never speak of them again



EVE

Adam!



CAIN

Poppa, listen to me. For once, listen!



ADAM

Tear it all down, is that what you want?

Tear down everything we've worked to build

Trust our lives to a bunch of ragged strangers

You see the promise, Cain, but not the dangers



You think they're so wise, you think they're so skilled

But you've never heard them chanting in their ring of stones

Never seen them dancing here among the bones

Of a beast they've killed



CAIN

How do you know what they are?



ADAM

Because I've been here! I have seen them.



EVE

Adam!



CAIN

When were you here?



ADAM

The two of you were babies still

A long, long time ago



EVE

You never told me.



ADAM

It was better not to know

It would still be better not to know



CAIN (simultaneously)

All these years you've lied to us

All these years denied to us our future



EVE (simultaneously)

All these years you never told, never discussed

After all these years, couldn't you trust me?

Couldn't you trust me?

After all these years



ADAM (simultaneously)

We don't even know who their father was

Would our Father feel betrayed?

What if these are people he never made?

After all these years, to lose the chance he might forgive



ABEL (simultaneously)

Everybody, stop fighting!



EVE

All I see is you are still afraid

There was a time once, you were so brave then



ADAM

And look what we got, look what it brought us

Look at the lesson our bravery taught us

We are lost in the wilderness

We belong out here in the wilderness



CAIN

Well then stay here forever!

If that's how you want to live

But Abel and I could find comrades and wives

And learn what it is to have hope in our lives

Be part of a tribe, part of a clan

Not just one family

But a family of man



Come on, Abel!



ADAM

Abel! If you go now, you will never see me again.



ABEL

Oh Cain, please don't make me choose

Either way, it's more than I could bear to lose

Either way, it's ripping out my heart

This choice is tearing me apart



CAIN

Is this what it means to be a father?

Crushing the spirit of your children like an egg

Is that what it means to be a father?

(???) him (???) you with a chain around the leg!
