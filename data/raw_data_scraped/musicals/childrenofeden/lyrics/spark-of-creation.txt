Spark of Creation


EVE

Beyond,beyond

It sounds full of wind and mist, doesn't it

It means other things exsist, doesn't it

Beyond, beyond

It says Adam leave your list, doesn't it

Father why does my head feel this joy this dread since the moment I said

Beyond!



I've got a itching on the tips of my fingers

I've got a burning in the back of my brain

I've got a hunger burning inside cannot be denied

I've got feeling that the Father who made us

When he was kindling a pulse in my veins

He left a tiny spark of that fire, smoldering inside



The spark of creation, is flickering within me

The spark of creation,is blazing in my blood

A bit of the fire that lit up the moon

And brought the mud, the first inspiration

The spark creation



I see a mountain and I want to climb it

I river and I want to leave shore

Where there was nothing let there be something, something made by me

There's things waiting for me to invent them

There's things waiting for me to explore

I am an echo of the eternal cry of

Let there be!



The spark of creation, burning bright within me

The spark of creation, won't let me rest at all

Until I discover or build or uncover

A thing that I can call, my celebration

Of the spark creation



The spark of creation, may it burn forever

The spark creation, I am a keeper of the flame

We think all we want is a lifetime leisure

Each perfect day the same

Endless vacation

Well that's alright if you're a kind crustacean

But when you're born with an imagination

Sooner of later you're feeling the fire getting hotter and higher

The spark of creation
