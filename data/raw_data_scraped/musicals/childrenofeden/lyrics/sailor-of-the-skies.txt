Sailor of the Skies


YONAH



Hush now stop trembling

We've got to do soemthing

Before all we are is a skeleton crew

There's go to be something someone can do

But all I can think of is you



Little sailor of the skies

Will you be our eyes

Is there land that lies

Beyond



Fly far beyond the rain

With a prayer upon thy wing

And in this winter of the storm

Seek a harbinger of spring

You're the only one can bring us home



Children of eden

Cry for salvation

Fly far as wings can fly

Bring home
