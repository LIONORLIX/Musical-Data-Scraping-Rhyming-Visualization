Tree of Knowledge


EVE

But Father, if the tree isn't good for us, why did you put it here?



FATHER

There are things a Father knows

A child cannot

I think you would agree

You're newer here than me

Have faith I have my reasons you cannot see

In your best interest

So no more questions about that tree



EVE

But Father--



FATHER

I know! Let's play a game!
