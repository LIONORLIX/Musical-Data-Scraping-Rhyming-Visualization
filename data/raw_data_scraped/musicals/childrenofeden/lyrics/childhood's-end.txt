Childhood's End


STORYTELLERS

And they heard the voice of Father

Walking in the garden in the cool of the day

And from Father's presence

Among the thickest trees, they hid themselves away



FATHER

So, you have tasted the fruit.



EVE

Yes, Father, but it's all right.

It didn't hurt me after all, and now I can see so clearly.

I can see what you can see!



I can see, I can see

How we can build things from trees

We can use the winds and rivers

I can see there's so much more for us to see



FATHER

Eve, you see too much

Can you see you have to go?



EVE

Go?



FATHER

Leave the garden.



EVE

But why?



FATHER

This is a place of innocence

This is a place for children

And you are a child no more



Adam, Eve is leaving here.



ADAM

Well, then, what if I went with her?



FATHER

Then you would never see me again.
