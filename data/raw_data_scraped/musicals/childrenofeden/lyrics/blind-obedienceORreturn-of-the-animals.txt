JAPHETH

Yonah’s been with us all our lives. You love her, too.



NOAH

We have no choice.



JAPHETH

There’s always a choice.



NOAH

We must do as Father commands.

Japheth!

Shem. Ham. Go after him. Don’t let him get too far.



MAMA

Papa, maybe if you asked God…



NOAH

His will is clear. I don’t want to discuss it anymore.



SHEM

He’s still here, Papa.



HAM

He’s just up on the boat.



NOAH

Good. I didn’t think he was that crazy…



APHRA

What is it?



AYSHA

A snake!



SHEM

It’s a rattlesnake. Stand back, everyone. I’ll get an ax.



HAM

Look out, Shem!



SHEM

What?



HAM

Stay still!



APHRA

It’s a turtle!



HAM

Hello, little turtle.



MAMA

I haven’t seen one of those for…



SHEM

Stay clear, all of you.



NOAH

Shem, don’t!  Put down the ax.



SHEM

But, Papa…



NOAH

Do as I say.

Ham, see if you can find another turtle over there.



HAM

Yes, Papa.



NOAH

Everyone!



AYSHA

Another rattlesnake!



APHRA

Where?



AYSHA

Right here!



HAM

Another turtle, Papa!



MAMA

Look!



NOAH

It’s happening. Praise God, it’s happening.



MAMA

Aphra, hand me the leftover salad.



NOAH

Where’s my list? Where’s my list?



Turtles… rattlesnakes… rabbits…



MAMA

Hares.



NOAH

Hares, rabbits…



HAM

Anteaters! Mama, your favorite!



SHEM

Anyone sees any ants, save a pair for the ark!
