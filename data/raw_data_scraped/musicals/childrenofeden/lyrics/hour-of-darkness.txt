Hour of Darkness


NOAH

As we may know

Our end is very near

And God's priorities are no longer clear to me

And so i ask you

If all we've got

Is just this little ride

Here and now

Eveyrone of us

Reconcile



YONAH

In whatever time we have



YONAH + JAPETH

For as long as we are living



YONAH, JAPETH + MAMA

We can face whatever comes



YONAH, JAPETH, MAMA + NOAH

If we face it now as one



YONAH, JAPETH, MAMA, NOAH, HAM, SHEM, APHRA + AISHA

If there's silence in the sky

In a world without a future

We will swear to be together

In whatever time

We have
