Clash of the Generations


ADAM

THE RAIN WILL BE HERE SOON.

WE’D BEST GET BACK TO THE SHELTER OF OUR GLEN.



CAIN

But what about these people…?



ADAM

WE WILL NEVER SPEAK OF THEM AGAIN.



EVE

Adam…



CAIN

Papa, listen to me. For once, listen…



ADAM

TEAR IT ALL DOWN — THAT’S WHAT YOU WANT.

TEAR DOWN EVERYTHING WE’VE WORKED TO BUILD.

TRUST OUR LIVES TO A BUNCH OF RAGGED STRANGERS.

YOU SEE THE PROMISE, CAIN, BUT NOT THE DANGERS.



YOU THINK YOU’RE SO WISE,

YOU THINK YOU’RE SO SKILLED —

BUT YOU’VE NEVER HEARD THEM CHANTING

IN THEIR RING OF STONES,

NEVER SEEN THEM DANCING HERE, AMONG THE BONES

OF THE BEASTS THEY’VE KILLED!



CAIN

How do you know what they are?



ADAM

Because I’ve been here, Cain. I’ve seen them.

EVE

Adam!



ABEL

Is this why we couldn’t go beyond the waterfall?



CAIN

When were you here?



ADAM

THE TWO OF YOU WERE BABIES STILL —

A LONG, LONG TIME AGO…



EVE

You never told me.



ADAM

IT WAS BETTER NOT TO KNOW.

IT WOULD STILL BE BETTER NOT TO KNOW.



CAIN

ALL THESE YEARS, YOU’VE LIED TO US —



EVE

ALL THESE YEARS, YOU NEVER TOLD, NEVER DISCUSSED —



CAIN

ALL THESE YEARS, DENIED TO US OUR FUTURE.



EVE

AFTER ALL THESE YEARS, COULDN’T YOU TRUST ME?



ABEL

IT’S ALL RIGHT, CAIN

PLEASE DON’T FIGHT, CAIN.



ADAM

EVE, WE DON’T EVEN KNOW WHO THEIR FATHER IS!

WOULD OUR FATHER FEEL BETRAYED?



EVE

COULDN’T YOU TRUST ME?



ADAM

WHAT IF THESE ARE PEOPLE HE NEVER MADE?



ABEL

EVERYBODY STOP FIGHTING!



ADAM

AFTER ALL THESE YEARS, TO LOSE THE CHANCE HE MIGHT

FORGIVE…

EVE…



EVE

AFTER ALL THESE YEARS, ALL I SEE

IS YOU ARE STILL AFRAID.

THERE WAS A TIME, ONCE…

YOU WERE SO BRAVE, ADAM…



ADAM

AND LOOK WHAT WE GOT.

LOOK WHERE IT BROUGHT US.

LOOK AT THE LESSON OUR BRAVERY TAUGHT US.

WE ARE LOST IN THE WILDERNESS —

WE BELONG OUT HERE, IN THE WILDERNESS!



CAIN

WELL, THEN — STAY HERE FOREVER,

IF THAT’S HOW YOU WANT TO LIVE;

BUT ABEL AND I COULD FIND COMRADES AND WIVES,

AND LEARN WHAT IT IS TO HAVE HOPE IN OUR LIVES,

BE PART OF A TRIBE, PART OF A CLAN,

NOT JUST ONE FAMILY, BUT A FAMILY OF MAN…



Come on, Abel.



ADAM

Abel, if you go now, you will never see me again.



CAIN

That’s all right. We’re never coming back.

Abel?



ADAM

Abel…



ABEL

OH, CAIN, PLEASE DON’T MAKE ME CHOOSE.

EITHER WAY, IT’S MORE THAN I CAN BEAR TO LOSE.

EITHER WAY, IT’S RIPPING OUT MY HEART.

THIS CHOICE IS TEARING ME APART…



ADAM

You’ll never get back to the garden, Abel. Father will come and you’ll be left

behind.



CAIN

Father will never come. Not for you. Not for any of us.



ADAM

That’s not true, Abel



CAIN

Tell him, brother.



ABEL

No…

Cain…



CAIN

Father came to see us. He came to spy on his grandchildren. He didn’t want to see

you.



EVE

Abel. Is this true?



ABEL

No.



ADAM

Liar!



CAIN

Are you coming or not?



ABEL

No.



CAIN

Fine. I’ll be better off without you.

Get out of my way.



ADAM

You’re not going anywhere.



CAIN

IS THIS WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A FATHER:

CRUSHING THE SPIRIT OF YOUR CHILDREN LIKE AN EGG?

IS THAT WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A FATHER:

BINDING THEM TO YOU WITH A CHAIN AROUND THE LEG?



EVE

Adam!



CAIN

Get out of my way, old man.



EVE

Let him go.



ADAM

Never.



CAIN

I’ll kill you.



(EVE runs between CAIN and ADAM, pushing ADAM off balance

as she does so)



EVE

Cain!



CAIN

Let me go!



ADAM

Cain!



EVE

Stop it, Cain! Both of you!!



ABEL

Stop it, brother! Stop!



CAIN

Let me go!!



EVE

Abel!



CAIN

That should have been you. that should have been you!
