In Whatever Time We Have


JAPETH



I don't give a damn for the thunders of fathers

Come hell or high water whatever they do

I could not live in a world without you



In whatever time we have

For as long as we are living

We can face whatever comes

If we face now as one

I could make on my own

Let me know that I don't have to

No one really wants to be alone

In whatever we time have



If at times we are afraid

With so little to believe in

It's alright to be afraid

I will hold you in the dark

All we know for sure is this

Though the world could end tommorow

You and I will be together

In whatever time



YONAH



In whatever time we have

For as long as we are living



JAPETH



We know life can be a battlefield



YONAH



We can face it all as one



JAPETH



But we won't run and we won't fear

You'll be my fortress and I will be your shield



JAPETH and YONAH



No one really wants to be alone

In whatever time we have



YONAH



There are time I've been afraid

In a world that's so uncertain

Then I feel your hand in mine

And there's courage in my heart



JAPETH



We could live a hundred years



YONAH



Or the world could in tommorow



YONAH and JAPETH



But we know we'll be together in whatever time



From this day forward lights don't seem so black

From this day forward we will never look back

In whatever time we have

We will make the most of time

And at least we'll be together in whatever time

We have
