In Pursuit of Excellence


SNAKE (AND GIRLS)

I've been watching you for a while now

My pretty little misss

And I've got to tell you thisss

You make me want to hisss

Your aimless curiosity is fast becoming tiresome

Knowledge, dear, is power

And it's high time you acquired some

Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb



Lesson one for free

Repeat it after me:

I'm in pursuit in excellence

Excellence is what I wish

Once I was a feckless dreamer

Now no being is supremer



Why waste time wallowing in ignorance?

Why be just a big fat fish in a tiny little pond?

Look beyond!

And if the quickest route

Means a taste of forbidden fruit

What the hey, it's all in pursuit of excellence!



Time for some sophisticating

It's no sin to be scintillating



So don't be such a stiff

Mmm, just take a sniff

Really, what's the diff?

If a couple fibs are spoken

A couple vows are broken

That's the price I guess

No pain, no gain!



You'll be swiftly overtaken

By some ambitious snake unless

You progress

Learn to dress

For success

Yes!



We're in pursuit of excellence

Winners get to take the risks

While the losers discuss

That's why they're losers!



Pass the test when you're tested

Be the best, not the bested

Let all the nervous wrecks

Stay too frightened to stick out their necks

They're not in pursuit of excellence like us

Like us! Like us!
