Let There Be


STORYTELLERS

In the beginning...



In the begininng,

God created the Heaven and Earth

Without form--void--darkness.

And God said:



FATHER

Let there be!



STORYTELLERS

Light!



FATHER

I woke up from a curious dream

I dreamed a perfect garden

And there were whirling shapes

And swirling sounds

And I wasn't lonely anymore



I woke up from a wonderful dream

Woke, full of energy and hunger

And now this hunger will be stilled

And my emptiness be filled

As I set about to build

My dream



Let there be, let there be

Morning

Let there be

Evening, day

Let there be



Let there be



STORYTELLERS

Let there be



FATHER

Waters, weathers, winters, wonders



STORYTELLERS AND FATHER

Let there be

Land and



FATHER

Speeding comets with hearts of ice!

Spinning planets with rings of fire!



STORYTELLERS AND FATHER

Cosmic sparks

And quasars and quarks

And suns convulsing

Pulsars pulsing



STORYTELLERS

Let there be



FATHER

Let there be



STORYTELLERS AND FATHER

Let there be



FATHER

Whales!

Snails!

Sharks!

Larks!

Apples trees with dappled barks!

And granite mountains and flaxen plains

Giant lizards with tiny brains

Flourescent fish and crescent worms

And a million bugs and trillion germs



STORYTELLERS

Let there be



FATHER

Let there be



STORYTELLERS AND FATHER

Let there be

(And God saw, it was good, it was good)

Let there be, let there be



FATHER

It's not enough! It's still not enough.

There was something more in my dream

Something could see it and share it

What was it, though?

I only know

I wasn't lonely anymore



There is one more thing to build

One more void that must be filled

I'll make creatures I'll call children

Shaped like me!



FATHER AND STORYTELLERS

Let there be, let there be



FATHER

Something, someone

Small and skinny

Clawless, furless

Finless, fangless



FATHER AND STORYTELLERS

Let there be

Man who can



FATHER

Wander over my flaxen plains

Wonder up at my granite mountains

Count the stars and wish for wings

And hold a tool and think of things

And search for answers he cannot see



STORYTELLERS

And dream of glory



FATHER

And worship me!



STORYTELLERS

Let there be



FATHER

Let there be



STORYTELLERS AND FATHER

Let there be

(And God saw, it was good, it was good)



FATHER

Let there be



STORYTELLERS

Let there be



FATHER AND STORYTELLERS

Let there be



STORYTELLERS (AND FATHER)

And the father breathed into his children the breath of life (let...)

And the children became living souls (there...)

And the father gave to his children a garden

And called the garden...Eden (be...)



STORYTELLERS AND FATHER

Let there be!
