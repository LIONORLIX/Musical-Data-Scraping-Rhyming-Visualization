Harden My Heart / Shadows Of The Night


Sherrie:

Cryin' on the corner

Waitin' in the rain

I swear i'll never, ever wait again

You gave me your word

But words for you are lies

Darlin' in my wildest dreams, i never thought i'd go

But it's time to let you know....oh

I'm gonna harden my heart

I'm gonna swallow my tears

I'm gonna turn...and...leave you here!

All of my life i've been waitin' in the rain

I've been waiting for a feeling that never, ever came

It feels so close

But always disappears



Justice charlier

Darlin', in your wildest dreams

You never had a clue

But it's time you got the news



Sherrie/ Justice:

I'm (you’re) gonna harden my (your) heart

I'm (you’re) gonna swallow my (your) tears

I'm (you’re) gonna turn...and...leave you here!



Justice charlier:

Hey sweetie.



Lonny:

This here is justice charlier. Owner of the “venus” strip- excuse me, gentlemen’s club, and mother to lots of lost souls on

Sunset boulevard. For a two drink minimum she’ll provide you a shoulder to cry on. In the champagne room? You can cry

Anywhere you like.



Justice charlier:

You say, oh girl, it's a cold world

When you keep it all to yourself

I said you can't hide on the inside

All the pain you've ever felt

Ransom your heart, but baby don't look back

‘cause we got nobody else

We're runnin’ with the shadows of the night

So baby take my hand, it'll be all right

Surrender all your dreams to me tonight

They'll come true in the end



Sherrie/ Ensemble:

I'm gonna harden my heart

I'm gonna swallow my tears

I'm gonna turn...and...leave you here



Sherrie:

Never in my wildest dreams

I never thought i'd go

But it's time to let you know....

I’m gonna harden my heart



Justice charlier/ Ensemble:

We're runnin’ with the shadows of the night



Sherrie:

I’m gonna swallow my tears



Justice charlier/ Ensemble

So baby take my hand, it'll be all right



Sherrie:

C’mon baby- let’s go inside.
