We Built This City / Too Much Time On My Hands


REGINA

Mayor, we don't know the first thing about these people. Or even what they want to build!



HERTZ

Say you don't know me

Or recognize my face

Say you care who goes to zat kind of place



REGINA

Knee deep in the hoopla

Sinking in your fight



HERTZ

Too many runaways



HERTZ & FRANZ

Eating up ze night



HERTZ

Marconi plays ze mamba!



REGINA

Listen to the radio

Don't you remember

We built this city

We built this city on...



MAYOR

Clean, efficient living?



HERTZ

Exactly!



REGINA

But mayor, think about the businesses already there. What abuot them?



DENNIS

They're calling it 'economic redevelopment'. Apparently the Bourbon no longer generates an "adequate tax revenue".



LONNY

That's why I keep telling you. We need to bring back naked jello wrestling Thursdays. But this time, check it, we let women enter.



DENNIS

Maybe it's time to cash it in, anyway...



DREW

Whoa, Dennis! What're you saying?



DENNIS

It's just I'm sittin' on this barstool

Talkin' like a damn fool

Got the twelve o'clock news blues

And I've given up hope

For the afternoon soaps

And a bottle of cold brew

Is it any wonder I'm not crazy?



LONNY

So chew a couple Prozac. Come on, Dennis!



DENNIS

Is it any wonder I'm sane at all?



DREW

You do wash your hands a lot...



DENNIS, LONNY, DREW, REGINA, FRANZ, HERTZ, MAYOR

Is it any wonder

I've got too much time on my hands?



DENNIS

And it's tickin' away



LONNY

Tickin' away from me!



DENNIS

Hold the phone! Do you guys see what's in today's paper?



DREW

"Monster rockers, Arsenal are breaking up. According to sources, lead singer, Stacee Jaxx will leave the band after this tour to pursue a solo career!"



DENNIS

Perfect, right? Lonny, who gave Arsenal they're start?



LONNY

We did. So?



DENNIS

so, what if we hosted they're last gig, ever?



LONNY

The last Arsenal show here?



DENNIS

Tell me that wouldn't generate an 'adequate tax revenue'. Plus, Stacee still owes me from that hotel incident with the Cool Whip and the baby llama.



LONNY

Love it!



DENNIS

I just hope it's enough.



LONNY

It's gotta be! I mean, the mayor isn't a total money grubbing whore. Wink!



REGINA

Mayor, you're not thinking clearly!



HERTZ

Mayor, take ze money, unt



HERTZ, FRANZ, MAYOR, ENSEMBLE

Rid this city



REGINA

Noooooo!



HERTZ, FRANZ, MAYOR, ENSEMBLE

We'll rid this city of rock and roll



REGINA

Not this city



MAYOR

Regina, you're fired!



HERTZ, FRANZ, MAYOR, ENSEMBLE

We'll rid this city of rock and roll



REGINA

You're not gonna get away with this!



LONNY

Haha, I can't believe you still have his number



DENNIS

Stacee? It's Denbo



STACEE

Who?



DENNIS

Dennis. Dennis Dupree? Listen. How would you like to do your Arsenal farewell show here at the Bourbon?



STACEE

Yeah, well we already got something planned for our last tour gig in Portland, so...



DENNIS

I understand that. But just imagine for a second, your last gig in a place that started it all. A lot of press on something like that.



STACEE

Yeah, it sounds cool, but, ah...



DENNIS

And of course, we'd put your name above the band. STACEE JAXX! ...And Arsenal. One night only. Right before a solo album... Which, just between you and me, I'm so glad your doing. you know what I always used to say about you.



STACEE

What?



DENNIS

Well you're a jet feul genuis

You can solve the world's problems

Without even tryin'!



STACEE

It's true

I got dozens of friends

And the fun never ends

That is, as long as I'm buyin'

Is it any wonder I'm not the president?



DENNIS

I'd vote for you, Stacee.



STACEE

Is it any wonder I'm null and void?



DENNIS

I don't even know what that means



STACEE, DENNIS, DREW, LONNY, HERTZ, MAYOR, FRANZ

Is it any wonder

I've got too much time on my hands



DENNIS

And it's tickin' away



LONNY, DENNIS, DREW

Tickin' away from me!



COMPANY

Too much time on my hands



DENNIS

Tick, tick, tickin' away!



COMPANY

Too much time on my hands



STACEE

I don't know what to do!



COMPANY

Too much time on my hands



HERTZ, FRANZ, MAYOR

We'll rid this city



ENSEMBLE

Too much time on my hands



HERTZ, FRANZ, MAYOR

Of rock and roll!



COMPANY

too much time on my hands...

Too much time on my hands...

Too much time...



HERTZ

DENNIS

Remember when you $#&%! that baby llama?



STACEE

I'll do it.
