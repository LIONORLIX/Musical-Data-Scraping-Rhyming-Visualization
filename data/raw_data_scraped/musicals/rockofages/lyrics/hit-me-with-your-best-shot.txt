Hit Me With Your Best Shot


Franz

(spoken, german accent)

What? You want to... Hit me?

(sung, also german accent)

Well you're the real tough cookie

With a long history of breaking little hearts, like the one in me.

Ah!

That's okay.

Let's see how you do it

Put up your dukes,

And let's get down to it! Ah...

Hit me with your best shot!

Why don't you hit me with your best shot?

Hit me with your best shot!

Fire away!

(spoken)

All i've ever done is try to please you!

But you know what? No more!



Hertz

(spoken. Slightly unintelligible, german accent)

-somethingsomethingsomething-

And your stupid little candy shop!



Regina

(spoken)

It's a confectionary store!

(sung)

You come on with the come on,

You don't fight fair



Hrtz

Thats okay, let's see if i care!



Franz

Knock me down, it's all in vain

I'll get right back on my feet again!



Franz and Regina

Hit me with your best shot!

Why don't you hit me with your best shot?

Hit me with your best shot!

Fire away!



Franz, Regina, and Ensemble

Hit me with your best shot!

Come on and hit me with your best shot!

Hit me with your best shot!

Fire away!
