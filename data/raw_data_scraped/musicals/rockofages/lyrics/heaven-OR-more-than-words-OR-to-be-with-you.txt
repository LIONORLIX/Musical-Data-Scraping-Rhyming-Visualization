Heaven / More Than Words / To Be With You


Sherrie:

Saying i love you

Is not the words i want to hear from you

Its not that i want you

Not to say, but if you only knew

How easy it would be to show me how you feel

More than words

Is all you have to do to make it real

Then you wouldn’t have to say that you love me

‘cause id already know…



Waitress #1:

You okay, girl?



Sherrie:

Yeah, i’m fine.



Waitress #1:

You don’t look fine.



Sherrie:

It’s just my…whatever, right? I'll be okay.



Waitress #1:

Hold on little girl

Show me what he's done to you

Stand up little girl

A broken heart can't be that bad



Sherrie:

When it's through, it's through



Waitress #1

Fate will twist the both of you

So come on baby, come on over

Let me be the one to show you…



Dennis:

Drew, you gotta be honest with your audience…real. Until you can share something that let’s us in, let’s us know what you

Care about --



Drew:

Wait.

How i love the way you move

And the sparkle in your eyes

There’s a color deep inside them

Like a blue suburban sky



Dennis:

Better.



Drew:

I don't need to be the king of the world

As long as i’m the hero of this…



Drew/ choir

Little girl!

Heaven isn't too far away

Closer to it everyday



Drew:

No matter what your friends say…



Sherrie:

I know we’re gonna find a way!!



Choir:

I'm the one who wants to be with you



Drew:

I’m the one



Choir:

Deep inside i hope you feel it too



Drew:

Deep inside



Choir:

Waited on a line of greens and blues



Drew:

You feel it too



Sherrie:

Waited on a line…!



Drew/ sherrie:

Just to be the next to be with you



Choir:

Heaven!



Drew:

Oh-oh-oh-oh



Sherrie:

More than words



Choir:

Heaven



Drew/ choir:

Oh-oh-oh-oh



Is all i ever needed you to show



Choir:

Heaven!!



Sherrie:

Then you wouldn’t have to say



Drew;

It’s not too far away



Sherrie:

That you love me



Drew:

Oh-oh-oh-oh!



Sherrie:

‘cause id already know



Drew:

How i love the way you move!!
