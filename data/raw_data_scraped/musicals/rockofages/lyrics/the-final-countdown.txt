The Final Countdown


We're leaving together

But still it's farewell

And maybe we'll come back,

To earth, who can tell?



I guess there is no one to blame

We're leaving ground (leaving ground)

Will things ever be the same again?

It's the final countdown.



The final countdown.



Oh, we're heading for venus (venus)

And still we stand tall

Cause maybe they've seen us

And welcome us all, yeah

With so many light years to go

And things to be found (to be found)

I'm sure that we'll all miss her so

It's the final countdown.



The final countdown.



The final countdown (final countdown).



Oh...oh



The final countdown.



Oh, it's the final countdown.



The final countdown.



The final countdown. (final countdown)



Oh, it's the final countdown

We're leaving together



The final countdown

We'll all miss her so

It's the final countdown (final countdown)

Oh, it's the final countdown
