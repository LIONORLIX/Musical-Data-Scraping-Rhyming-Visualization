Just Like Paradise / Nothin' But A Good Time


Lonny:

Come on feel the noise

Girls rock your boys

We'll get wild, wild, wild!



Lonny/Ensemble:

Wild, wild, wild!



Lonny:

Yeah!! What’s going down, home listeners!!

That’s right, we’re going back to a sexier time!

And if you were here, you could see this super hot chick driving past me right now.

Rockin' steady in her daddy's car

She got the stereo with the big guitars

And that's all right! Yeah!



Ensemble:

All right!



Lonny:

I got the itch and a restless soul



Justice charlier:

She gone with the wind

Gonna go for broke tonight!

Yeah! And that’s’



Justice/Ensemble:

All right!



Lonny:

That’s it, that’s it!

Girl, we've been meant for this since we were born!



Ensemble:

Since we were born!



Lonny:

No problems now, the coast is clear!



Dennis:

It's just the calm before the storm!



Lonny/ Dennis/ justice/ Ensemble:

And i don't want to go home!!



Lonny:

That’s right, my babies. Welcome to the sunset strip! ‘An acid wash epicenter!!’

Do you feel it!’ Man, back in the day if a fella had a dream, a fifth of jack

And a decent amount of hair, there was nowhere else to be!



Drew:

I can barely make it through the week

Saturday night id like to make my girl

But right now i cant make ends meet



Drew/ Lonny/ Ensemble:

I’m always workin, slavin’, every day

Gotta get away from the same old same old!



Drew:

I need a chance just to get away!
