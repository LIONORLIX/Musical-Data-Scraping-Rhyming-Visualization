High Enough


Sherrie

I don't want to hear about it anymore

It's a shame i've got to live without you anymore



Drew

There's a fire in my heart

A pounding in my brain

It's driving me crazy



Both

We don't need to talk about it anymore

Yesterday's just a memory; can we close the door?



Sherrie

I just made one mistake



Drew

Oh, i didn't know what to say



Both

When you called me baby



Don't say goodnight

Say you're gonna stay forever

Oh, whoa, all the way



Can you take me high enough?



Sherrie

Can you fly me over



Drew

Fly me over



Both

Yesterday?



Can you take me high enough?



Sherrie

It's never over, whoa whoa whoa



Drew

I was running

I was running for the door

Realizing now or never

I was running back for more

Oo, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah



Both

Don't say goodbye

Say you're gonna stay forever,

Oh, whoa, all the way, all the way



Sherrie

Come all the way, yeah



Both

Can you take me high enough



Sherrie

Can you fly me over



Drew

Fly me over



Both

Yesterday?



Can you take me high enough?



Sherrie

Its never over

Yesterday's just a memory



Drew

Yesterday's just a memory
