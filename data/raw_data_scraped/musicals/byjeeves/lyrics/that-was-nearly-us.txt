That Was Nearly Us


HONORIA

Did you see that couple there?



BERTIE

Can't say I did...



HONORIA

Standing by the tree?



BERTIE

Really? Was it raining?



HONORIA

That was nearly us back there



BERTIE

Don't quite follow...



HONORIA

Nearly you and me



BERTIE

Oh yes, I see. Brrmmm!



HONORIA

Bertie, you've been badly neglected

You need a wife who'll correct it

The secret with men, of course, is

To treat them a bit like horses...

Did you see those lovers there?



BERTIE

No, I think they were pheasants, actually...



HONORIA

Even you could see



BERTIE

Oh, lovers! I thought you said plovers, sorry.



HONORIA

Oh, so nearly us back there



BERTIE

Was it? Nearly ran over them, then...



HONORIA

Nearly you and me



BERTIE

Appear to be running out of cardboard...



HONORIA

Could it be we took some wrong turning?

Is this a lesson worth learning?

Can't you see that couple there

Could well have been you and me?



BERTIE

Hump back bridge!



HONORIA

That was nearly us back there

Wouldn't you concur?



BERTIE

Hairpin bend, hang on...



HONORIA

He was so like you back there

I could have been her



BERTIE

No, I think they were both very much shorter.



HONORIA

Here you are, so vital, attractive-

Would that your brain was as active

You're nobody's intellectual

You hot-blooded het'rosexual...



BERTIE

Oh, now, simmer down...



HONORIA

Was it merely lucky chance

Brought us here today?

Victims both of circumstance

Meeting you this way



BERTIE

Brrrrmmmm! Brrrrrmmmm!!



HONORIA

It's as though our lives had been frozen

Back on the paths we'd both chosen

Giving us a fleeting glimpse

Of all that was meant to be

That was surely us back there

It's as clear as day

If we'd both kept faith back there

Hadn't lost our way



BERTIE

Nearly there ... Here's the village



HONORIA

What if we defied dull convention?

Stood up to shout our intention?



BERTIE

Steady!



HONORIA

If we'd followed our heart's volition

and shed our last inhibition?



BERTIE

Here we are! At last!



HONORIA

That's out future life back there



BERTIE

Cheerio then!



HONORIA

Bertie, can't you see?



BERTIE

You'd better hop in there smartish...



HONORIA

That was meant for us back there



BERTIE

You don't want to get gangrene...



HONORIA

All we're meant to be

Time we took the plain facts and faced them

Turned in our tracks and retraced them

Back to when that couple there

So clearly were you and me...
