BERTIE

It is patently clear

Any awkwardness here

Can be cleared up in less than a trice

Our identity switch

Who is who, which is which

We're in need of some solid advice

There's a painfully simple solution

It's as plain as the nose on your face

Of exerting the mind

We are filled with a deep sense of dread

"Does one give exercise

To a thing that's in bed in your head?"

ALL

By George! By Jove! By Jeeves!

Our collective I.Q.

Of around 42

Cannot cope, to be perfectly frank

All true leaders of men

Delegate now and then

Try to keep their minds totally blank

To appreciate loftier matters



BINGO

Things that mostly go over my head

Conceives a scheme so carefully planned

Even we can understand

If he takes it terribly slow - ly
