It's a Pig!


HONORIA

Who are you? Someone quick! There's a man broken in!

In a pig mask, broken in my bedroom!

Stand well clear! He's all mine!

I can deal with this swine

With this chauvinist pig in my bedroom!

When I'm through, I will bet

You will live to regret

that you picked on me, you and I ever met

I'm teaching you a lesson that you never will forget

You're a pig! What a pig! What a pig!



MADELINE

Oh dear, help! It's a pig! Daddy, help it's a pig!

There's a beastly piggy in my bedroom



HONORIA

Cornered! He's cornered!



MADELINE

Is it real or a dream?

Get away, or I'll scream!

Who on earth let this pig in my bedroom?



HONORIA

Lend a hand! Bar the door!

And we've trapped him for sure



MADELINE

I shall die if the thing makes a mess on my floor...



HONORIA

Speaking as a woman who has hunted wild boar

What's a pig, more or less? What's a pig?

Now we've got him!



BERTIE

Look, it's Bertie...



HONORIA

Nice and easy...



MADELINE

It's so dirty!



BERTIE

Listen, Maddy...



MADELINE

Don't come near me!



HONORIA

Don't dare touch her, do you hear me!



BERTIE

Oh, this damn thing's stuck completely!

Exit Wooster, swift and sweetly!



HONORIA/MADELINE

Follow that pig!



BASSETT

Bless my soul! Who are you? What on earth's going on?

There's a circus artist in my bedroom



MADELINE

Stop him!



HONORIA

We've got him!



BASSETT

Can't believe both my eyes

There's a chap in disguise

There's a cat burgling pig in my bedroom

Careful, girls, all stand back

He may try to attack...

It's a well known fact that they hunt as a pack

Wait while I distract him, try to put him off the track

Watch that pig!



HONORIA

Watch the pig!



MADELINE

Watch the pig!



BERTIE

Listen, people...



BASSETT

Don't you try it!



MADELINE

Tried to kiss me



BERTIE

I deny it!



BASSETT

Oh, you swine you!



HONORIA

Caught him looting!



BASSETT

Raise your hands or I'll start shooting!



BERTIE

With a badly bruised libido

Exit Wooster tres rapido



HONORIA, MADELINE, BASSETT

Follow that pig!

Hunt the pig! Hunt the pig! Hunt the two-legged pig!

There's a pig loose somewhere in the house here



GUSSIE/HONORIA/MADELINE

Find him!





BASSETT/GUSSIE

And catch him!



MADELINE/HONORIA

Everybody look out

For the glimpse of a snout



BASSETT/GUSSIE

For the click of his trotters on the stairway



MADELINE

There he is!



HONORIA

False alarm!



BASSETT

We must try to keep calm



MADELINE

I'm afraid! I'm afraid!



GUSSIE

Then take hold of my arm



BASSETT

I'll let him have both barrels, it'll work just like a charm

On the pig



BERTIE

Steady on!



ALL

There's the pig!

There's the pig! There's the pig! There's the housebreaker pig!

There's the pig with criminal intentions

Once he's caught there is talk

We'll reduce him to pork

In a way that's too terrible to mention

Can't escape, now he's caught

He can grunt he can snort

It's a great new game, chasing porkers for sport

Now we've got him cornered there's a lesson to be taught

To the pig, to the pig, to the pig
