What Have You Got to Say, Jeeves?


BERTIE

What have you got to say, Jeeves?

What have you got to say?



JEEVES

Sir -



BERTIE

Your job's to protect me and to cushion me from shocks

Not to let the poor young master end up crouching in a box

Leave him posing as a coatstand there, the minute someone knocks

No, somebody's got to pay, Jeeves

Somebody's got to pay



JEEVES

If you would allow me, sir -



BERTIE

Threatened with a lynch mob and I lose my oldest friends

I'm embroiled with random females bent on dire romantic ends

Yours is frankly not a judgement, Jeeves, on which a chap depends

It's bordering on risque, Jeeves

Utterly declasse...



JEEVES

If I might -



BERTIE

Your job's to inspire me with encouragement and praise

Not abandon me with Stiffy in some frightful leafy maze

Not to make me change my name three times in just as many days

Here I am in an extreme position

General Custer out of ammunition

Didn't get here by my own volition

As Tennyson once thundered

Someone here has badly blundered



JEEVES

Sir -



BERTIE

It's chaos and disarray, Jeeves

Misery and dismay



JEEVES

Perhaps if i could interr -



BERTIE

Calling this a shambles is to understate the case

Look at all these banjo lovers, not a dry eye in the place

I shall never have the nerve again to look them in the face

So what have you got to say, Jeeves?

What have you got to say?



JEEVES

I fear I must confess it, sir

Despite my best endeavours to

Ensure a fluid narrative

Things haven't gone to plan

Evens were overtaken, sir

By unseen technicalities

I really can assure you, though

I've done the best I can

There comes the odd occasion, sir

When facing up to destiny

We'd do as well as well remembering

A man is but a man

You have my firm assurances

That come the grand denouement, sir

Events will all resolve themselves

In spite of come what may

I only can apologize

For any inconvenience

Injurious to your dignity

That happens on the way

I simply wish to emphasize

I have your interests uppermost

And that, sir, in conclusion, sir

Is all I have to say!
