Banjo Boy


BERTIE & COMPANY

Who's the man you've all been sitting there anticipating?

Whos' the man with his instrument ready, willing and waiting?

Who's the man for whom your breath has been eagerly baiting?

If I hadn't already confessed it

You'd no doubt already have guessed it

Banjo boy, banjo boy, play a number for me

Won't you play that melody?

When you start your plain' - Mama starts a-swayin'

She's right there with 'em - stompin' that rhythym

Banjo boy, banjo boy, play the razzamatazz

You're the sunny southland's king

You set Dixie hummin' it - when you started strummin' it

See those fingers goin'

When you start to syncopate

Songbirds seem to orchestrate

The Swanee stops it's flowin'

Just hear him play

Who can plunk your heartstrings full of joy

That's banjo boy



COMPANY

Hear him go

Don't you know

Love him so

Let him swing

And do his thing

He's the king

Ring-a-ding



BERTIE & COMPANY

Banjo boy, banjo boy, you're the musical sun

In those southern sunny skies

Feet will start their fidgets - see those magic digits

Hands are a clappin' - fingers a snappin'

Banjo boy, banjo boy, play that favourite tune

That the old folks love to sing

Can't you hear the people cry

Wann see those fingers fly



COMPANY

Listen to him playin'

Can't you hear those children roar

Dixie's shoutin' out for more

Hear the steamboats blowin'

Eight to the bar

Who's that cotton pickin' hunk of joy?

That golden kid that fashion can't destroy?

Whose name they shout from Maine to Illinois?

That's banjo boy!

Banjo boy!
