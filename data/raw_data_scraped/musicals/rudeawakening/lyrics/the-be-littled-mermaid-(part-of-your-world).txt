The Be-Littled Mermaid (Part Of Your World)


Look at my tail, isn't it neat?

Notice they bound up my legs and my feet

Wouldn't you think I be glad

Glad I'm a Broadway star

They've got gadgets and gismos a plenty

They've got millions of tie ins galore



Spoken:

You want souvenir dolls? We've got twenty.



But I feel, I'm not real, I want more



I thought I be where the actors are

I thought I work as a fosse dancer

I thought I wear pretty high-heel shoes on my



Spoken:

What do you call them? Oh feet!



Flippin my fins I don't get too far

Legs are required to be a dancer

Having a tail you can never feel quite complete

Wanted to sing, wanted to dance

Now I'm a store and I get my chance

But when I bow, Broadway is now

Part Disney World



Dress like a worm

I have to squirm

Like I'm an otter

Disney should pay

Double each day

When I crash land



Betcha I'm panned

Spiting out sand

Or end up tuna canned in water

Teenage Women

Love my swimmin'

But I can't stand



I'm ready to go from this soggy show

Out of town critics flayed and fried me

And their reviews make me angry

And what's the word? Burn



Now it's my turn

I got my wish

But I'm a diva playing a fish

It's such a shame

Broadway Be came

Part Disney World



Spoken:

Hello lobster. He's my leading man.
