Daddy Knows Best


Life is short and the end is near

It's important to identify what you hold dear

It's clear

Pearl, your daddy always knows best



PEARL

"I'm not in the mood for a teaching moment right now."



MR. KRABS

Lemme tell you what counts more than all the rest

Money-money matters most

Money-money I can boast

Money-money, make a toast

Money! Money! Money! Ha!



PEARL

"You just don't understand me. I mean, I know we're not the same species,

but that doesn't mean that money's theâ€”"



MR. KRABS

Baby, money makes funny things funnier, sunny things sunnier

Nothing's crummier than no bread

Pearl, your daddy always knows best



PEARL

"Daddy, would you just listen to me?"



MR. KRABS

Pearl, lemme show you how deeply we're blessed

Money-money in this drawer

Money-money 'round the store

Money-money from the floor

Money! Money! Money! Ha!



PEARL

I should be my daddy's greatest prize

But instead, he's got dollar signs in his eyes

Daddy, you just don't understand

All I care about is rockin' out with my favorite band (yeah, yeah, yeah)



Oh, the feeling that it creates (yeah, yeah)

When I hear the Electric Skates



MR. KRABS

[COINS JANGLING] "Can you hear it, Pearl?"



(Money-money, money-money, money-money, money-money...)



PEARL

Daddy, can you hear me?

Can you hear me at all?!

DADDY!



MR. KRABS

Money-money in the air



PEARL

Can you hear me?!



MR. KRABS

Money-money everywhere



PEARL

Oh, can you hear me?! No!



MR. KRABS

Money-money, do not share



PEARL

Daddy!



MR. KRABS

PEARL

PEARL

MR. KRABS

PEARL

Can you hear me?! No!



MR. KRABS

Money-money, I love you



MR. KRABS

Money-money!



PEARL

PEARL & MR. KRABS

Money-money-money-money-money-money-money-money

Daddy-daddy-daddy-daddy-daddy-daddy-daddy-daddy



PEARL

MR. KRABS

"I'm sorry, Pearl, were you trying to say something?"



PEARL

MR. KRABS

Money!
