Hero Is My Middle Name


SPONGEBOB

If the world is gonna end tomorrow

Wallowing in sorrow won't get us anywhere

You'll find all the strength you need is inside

Like Poseidon ridin' 'cross the tide

Don't let this moment pass by

Come on



Hero is my middle name

Fixing trouble is my game

Just give it the old know-how

There's no better time than now

Don't give up and don't give in



PATRICK

"Yeah!"

If you're thinking sink or swim



SPONGEBOB

"Oh yeah!"

Courage is your plane to fame

When hero is your middle name



SPONGEBOB & PATRICK

And hero is our middle name



SANDY

"That's nice, boys, but mine's Jennifer."



My machines, they made a real prediction

It's not science fiction, there's nothing we can do at all



SPONGEBOB

Why are you waiting for the bottom to fall?

It's not the time to drop the big beach ball

All for one and one for all

"Hmm?"



SPONGEBOB & PATRICK

All for one and one for all

All for one and one for all

Come on



SANDY

Hero is my middle name



SPONGEBOB

"All right!"



SANDY

Fixing trouble is my game

Just give it the old know-how



SPONGEBOB, PATRICK, & SANDY

There's no better time than now



SANDY

Don't give up and don't give in

If you're thinking sink or swim

Courage is your plane to fame



SPONGEBOB, PATRICK, & SANDY

When hero is your middle name



SANDY

And hero is my middle name

"All right, boys, let's do this!"



SPONGEBOB

"Three heroes to the rescue!"



SANDY

"Team of Tres of the top!"



PATRICK

"Let's go!"



SPONGEBOB, PATRICK, AND SANDY

So come on

Hero is our middle name

Fixing trouble is our game



SANDY

Just give it the old know-how



SPONGEBOB, PATRICK, & SANDY

There's no better time than now

Don't give up and don't give in!

If you're thinking sink or swim

Courage is your plane to fame

When hero is your middle name

And hero is our middle name

Hero is our middle

Name
