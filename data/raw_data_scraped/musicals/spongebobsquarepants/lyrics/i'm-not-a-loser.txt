I'm Not a Loser


SQUIDWARD

I’m not a loser.

I don’t secretly hate myself.

I’m not singing this to no one,

It’s not the case that no one cares.

I’m not a failure.

I don’t not have talent.

When others see me they can’t see the nobody that isn’t there.



"Now hold on, that’s a triple negative, you can’t NOT see nobody.

‘Cause I’m nobody, which can’t not be seen.  Let me start over."



My life’s not empty.

They don’t not like me at all.

I don’t not leave the house,

‘Cause I don’t not prefer to stay at home.

I don’t stink.

I’m not a waste.

I’m not all alone in thinking,

That I am not all alone.



"Maybe I am a loser."



SEA ANEMONE CHORUS LINE

Hey Squidward!



SQUIDWARD

"Um…"



SEA ANEMONE CHORUS LINE

You’re not delirious with despair,

And you’re not calling true things false!

Hey Squidward!

SQUIDWARD

Oh this is weird!



SEA ANEMONE CHORUS LINE

You’re not hallucinating this sea anemone chorus line at all!



SQUIDWARD

"I’m not!?"



SEA ANEMONE CHORUS LINE

You’re not a loser.

You don’t secretly hate yourself.

You’re not singing this to no one,

It’s not the case that no one cares.

You’re not a failure.

You don’t not have talent.

When others see you they can’t see the nobody that isn’t there.



SQUIDWARD

(ohhh you don’t stink)

I’m not a waste!

(You’re not a waste)

I’m not all alone in thinking that I am not all alone!

(Instrumental/Tap dance break)



SQUIDWARD

SEA ANEMONE
