Tomorrow Is


SANDY

We only have tomorrow

To try to save the day

The world will end tomorrow

Spongebob, we have to find a way



SANDY & SPONGEBOB

A way



SANDY

We're gonna climb that mountain

However scared we are

Our team may just have two now

But we can still go far



SQUIDWARD

I only have tomorrow

To show them what I've got



MR. KRABS

We only have tomorrow

So get 'em while they're hot!



PLANKTON

Oh, I'm delirious

Such sweet revenge

Tomorrow means



PLANKTON & KAREN

Victory



SPONGEBOB

We only have tomorrow (tomorrow)

I wish it was with you



SPONGEBOB & SANDY

The world will end tomorrow

We know what we must do



ALL

The sun has sunk below us

The dark of night is here

The hands of time keep ticking

Tomorrow's almost here

Almost here

Almost here



We only have tomorrow

To somehow find a way

To save ourselves tomorrow

There's only one more day



SPONGEBOB

In the world renowned (world renowned)



TOWNSPEOPLE

Bikini Bottom



SPONGEBOB

We have to save this town (only have tomorrow)



TOWNSPEOPLE

Bikini Bottom



SPONGEBOB

As the sun goes down



SPONGEBOB & TOWNSPEOPLE [OVERLAPPING]

On a beautiful Bikini Bottom

We only have one more



ALL

Day
