Poor Pirates


PATCHY

Let me begin with a hearty ho-ho

And a tale that nobody tells well

I've not come all the way from In-C-I-N-O

To be treated like sewage that smells

Now I'm certainly not that surprised

For this story is older than time

Me peg-legged pirate bretheren and I

Are society's slug-ridden slime



We've all been cast out as scallywag rogues

With fire in our beards and our eyes

There's a side to us pirates that nobody knows

And it's soft as a baby's backside

Some of us just want adventures

We only seek wind in our earrings

We are we constantly misunderstood?

Don't ya know pirates have feelings?



ALL

Poor pirates, p-o-o-r

Poor pirates, p-o-o-r

Poor pirates

Can't deny this simple truth

Poor pirates, p-o-o-are

People too (too)



PATCHY

"Nice harmonies, mateys!"



PIRATES

[CHEERING]



PATCHY

Think of how hard we have had it (so hard)

'Bout our ships there is not much to eat (not much to eat)

And dentists hate pirate insurance (yo-ho, no!)



ALL

Which is why we've so many gold teeth (we've too many gold teeth)



PATCHY

Laundry stays damp and me boots start to sink

And me fingernails filthy and dirty

The internet loads unbelievably slow



ALL

And we bedtimes are at seven thirty



Poor pirates, p-o-o-r, p-o-o-r

Poor pirates, p-o-o-r, p-o-o-r

Poor pirates

Can't deny this simple truth

We're poor pirates, p-o-o-r, p-o-o-r

Poor pirates, p-o-o-r, p-o-o-r

Poor pirates

Have it so much worser than you



PIRATE

We've got pirate parades to which nobody comes



PIRATE

Captain Kidd hosts a marathon but nobody runs



PIRATE

Long John Silver invented the bloomin' onion



PIRATE

But d'you think he gets credit for that?



ALL

No!



PIRATE

Captain Bombum, no one knows his first name



PIRATE

And Old Greenbeard's been driven completely insane



PIRATE

Hardly anyone celebrates our one holiday (argggh!)



PIRATE

Talk Like a Pirate Day



ALL

We are poor pirates, p-o-o-r

Poor pirates, p-o-o-r

Poor pirates

Can't deny this simple truth

Can't deny that we're poor (pirates are people too!)



Poor pirates, p-o-o-r

Poor pirates, p-o-o-r

Poor pirates

Can't deny this simple truth

That pirates p-o-o-are

People too

Yo-ho! Ha!
