When the Going Gets Tough


PLANKTON

"Give me some music, Karen."



KAREN

[BEATBOXING AGGRESSIVELY]



PLANKTON

This task force is for losers

I've got the perfect plan

Right now the getting's good so

Let's get out while we can

Look, lava's pretty hot

Let's give in to our fear

Disaster's on its way, that means

We can't spend no more time in here



You all know who I am

Evil genius, giant brain

You can't stop a volcano

I mean, are you all insane?

The ones who stay will all be vaporized without a doubt

Before that sucker blows, we gotta get the fish out! (fish out, fish out, fish out)



TOWNSPEOPLE

Oh, let go (oh, let go!)

And begone (and begone!)

Oh, let go (oh, let go!)

And begone (and begone!)

Oh, let go (oh, let go!)

And begone (and begone!)

Oh, let go (oh, let go!)

And we gone! (and we gone!)



'Cause when the going gets tough (when the going gets tough)

That means it's time to get launched (that means it's time to get launched)

When the going gets tough (when the going gets tough)

That means it's time to get lost (that means it's time to get launched)

So let go

And begone

Let's be gone



SPONGEBOB

Hold on, Plankton!

I am simply shocked

Bikini Bottom is our home

I can't believe you talk about

Just walkin' out

Let's figure out

A way to stay today, tomorrow

I feel sorrow, I feel fear

But I'm not leaving here!

Who's with me?



PLANKTON

The simple sponge is talking?

Fascinating, do go on

The frycook has a plan?

Good luck with that, 'cause I'll be gone

You don't just wait around when you're under attack, no



KAREN

You run like crazy



PLANKTON

Out the back



PLANKTON & KAREN

Y'got one day left

Go home and pack



TOWNSPEOPLE

Oh, let go (oh, let go!)

And begone (and begone!)

Oh, let go (oh, let go!)

And begone (and begone!)

Oh, let go (oh, let go!)

And begone (and begone!)

Oh, let go (oh, let go!)

And we gone! (and we gone!)



'Cause when the going gets tough (when the going gets tough)

That means it's time to get launched (that means it's time to get launched)

When the going gets tough (when the going gets tough)

That means it's time to get lost (that means it's time to get launched)

So let go

And begone

Let's be gone



MR. KRABS

"Hold on! This is another one of your schemes. You've got somethin' up your sleeve."



PLANKTON

"I am a one-celled organism. I don't even HAVE sleeves!"



KAREN

"Ohhh!"



TOWNSPEOPLE

"OHHHHH!!!"



Oh, let go (oh, let go!)

And begone (and begone!)

Oh, let go (oh, let go!)

And begone (and begone!)

Oh, let go (oh, let go!)

And begone (and begone!)

Oh, let go (oh, let go!)

And we gone! (and we gone!)



'Cause when the going gets tough (when the going gets tough)

That means it's time to get launched (that means it's time to get launched)

When the going gets tough (when the going gets tough)

That means it's time to get lost (that means it's time to get launched)

So let go

And begone

Let's be gone

Let's be gone

So let go!
