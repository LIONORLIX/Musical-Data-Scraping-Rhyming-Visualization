Mrs. Remington


Alvin

The beginning.

A story about alvin kelby.

My mom passed away

In the summer i turned six





Write that down.





Thomas

Alvin, what's the point’





Alvin

Trust me.





(thomas writes in his notebook.)





Thomas

Alvin's mom passed away in the summer he turned six.





Alvin

Good.





And left a single father and his son.





But dad had the bookstore

With a leaky roof to fix.

So i was on my own

Facing the unknown,

The terrifying prospect of grade one.





But at the time how was i to see

A kind and gentle soul was waiting there for me’





Mrs. Remington, our first grade teacher

Made elementary school a better place.

But her single most disturbing feature

Was the coarse black hair on her face.





Maybe she was menopausal.

Lack of estrogen will cause

A lot of odd conditions,

Some acute!





The irony would never faze her

Namesake of a famous razor.

And to be so facially hirsute.





But mrs. Remington smiled

And she would brighten my day.

Back then a teacher hugged you

To make you feel okay.





Though my face sorta stung

From mrs. Remington’s beard,

When she held me, my problems disappeared.





Mrs. Lynch was an ignoramus,

Mr. Pollack was just plain mean.

Mrs. Remington was nearly famous

For her parties at halloween.





Pumpkin heads of every shape

Were cut out of construction paper.

Each and every one would be displayed.





The highlight for the children was

To make a really special costume

For the yearly halloween parade.





Mrs. Remington smiled

And she was clearly content

As she lovingly presided

Over this, the main event.





So we’d nervously walk

Past her critical eyes

And we’d vie for mrs. Remington’s top prize.





Thomas

There was this one kid wearing cardboard wings,

A coat hanger halo, carrying a bell and a homemade book that said tom sawyer.

Nobody had a clue what he was supposed to be.





Alvin except me.





(alvin becomes his younger self.)





Oh, oh, oh, mrs. Remington!





Pamela koshan thought he was the statue of liberty.





Mrs. Remington, i know!





Thomas

Donnie carter thought he was a thanksgiving turkey.





Alvin

Mrs. Remington, i know. He’s clarence.

The angel from it’s a wonderful life. He was my mother’s favorite.





Thomas

The class laughed.

Alvin

I cried. And mrs. Remington announced that i was next.





But mrs. Remington smiled

In that way that she had.

A smile that made you realize

That things were not so bad.





And i knew from her face

That this feeling would pass.

So i went to take my turn before the class.





Thomas

Those poor kids were still trying to figure out who the heck clarence was...





Alvin

... When i shuffled onto the platform in fuzzy slippers and bathrobe,

With pink sponge curlers in my hair.

"alvin kelby," mrs. Remington said, "and what are you supposed to be’"





I’m a ghost. The ghost of my mother.





Lunch that day was awful lonely

Sitting by myself and only

Wearing fuzzy slippers and chenille.





While all the kids were making fun

In came mrs. Remington

With clarence dragging slowly on her heel.





"clarence," she said, "i’d like you to meet mrs. Kelby. She’s a big fan of yours."





And mrs. Remington smiled

‘Cause mrs. Remington knew

That the battlefield of childhood

Was easier with two.





Mrs. Remington watched,

As the angels do,

And on halloween that year

She saw two masks disappear

When my mother met her angel

And i met you.
