You're Amazing, Tom


Alvin

You should have told me about that.





Thomas

Alvin never would have understood.





Alvin

Yes i would.





Thomas

I had too much coming at me.





Alvin

You should have said something.





Thomas

I couldn't work. I couldn't write. I had to streamline my personal life.





(alvin selects a story and reads.)



Alvin

Money and prizes.

A story about thomas.





Having streamlined his personal life,

Thomas was able to focus on more important matters.





Thomas

But as much as i tried to focus, there was always this voice in my head -

Alvin's patient, supportive and aggravating voice.





Alvin

Another award’ You are so talented, tom.





(thomas addresses an award ceremony audience.)



Thomas

Thank you so much for this. I’m flattered but completely at a loss as to why you’ve chosen me.





Alvin

You’re amazing, tom.

And to prove it

They’re throwing this big fancy do

For you.





You’re amazing, tom.

If i’d known about this

I’d have been there today.

Well, anyway.





I’m sure you have no time to call.

I know that your schedule’s tight.

You’re probably needed at signings and parties.

C’mon, i’m your pal, it’s all right.

You’re amazing, tom.





Thomas

I'm frequently asked, "where do your stories come from’" i don't know.

All i know is there's got to be thousands of stories in this head of mine just waiting for me to pick

One and write it down.





Alvin

You’re amazing, tom.

You’re everything i always knew you could be.

Times three.





Thomas

But it's lonely work. Just me and the blank page.





Alvin

You’re amazing, tom.

And to think that you made it here

All on your own.

Well, who’d have known’





Your writing has passion and skill

While others are churning out fluff.

It’s easy to pander to low expectations,

But quality stories are tough.





Thomas

And the indescribable feeling of writing those first few words knowing

I'm on my way to changing people’s lives.





Alvin

What you do is important.

What you do is an art.

What you’re doing is feeding your readers

Ideas with heart.





Let’s admit it, you’re making

The planet a happier place.

It’s because of the minds you are saving

That someone is waving

Another award in your face.





You’re amazing, tom.





Thomas

Every one of my stories - the butterfly, the marvelous mystical bookstore,

The memory robe, even the incredibly popular mrs. Remington's hallowe'en -

Every one was up here just waiting for me to set it free.





Alvin

You’re amazing, tom. The result of the choices you made is success.

I guess.





You’re amazing, tom.

It’s hard when you have to leave

Some things behind.

Well never mind.





Some people march in parades.

While others just watch them go by.





Thomas

Of course, i can't leave the stage without a few thank-yous.





Alvin

So soak up the praise and enjoy the ovation.





Thomas

My publisher.





Alvin

Though nobody special will share your elation.





Thomas

My agent.





Alvin

Money and prizes are fine consolation

And tangibly indicate why...





Thomas

And the single most important person in all of this. The one who buys my book.





Alvin

... You’re amazing, tom.





(thomas confronts alvin.)





Thomas

It’s elusive, alvin.

It’s like angels in the snow.

Turn your back and there they go.





(thomas selects a story.)





Thomas

Angels in the snow.

A work in progress.
