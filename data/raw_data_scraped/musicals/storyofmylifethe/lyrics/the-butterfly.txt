The Butterfly


Alvin

A neat career.

A story about thomas.





Thomas

Okay.





My college application required a sample of my writing, a short story, and i had nothing.

I'd been writing things down for years but nothing resembled an actual story.

So, in a panic i went to find alvin at the store to tell me what to do.





Alvin

There's gotta be thousands of stories in that head of yours, tom.

Just pick one and write it down.

Thomas

So i picked one and wrote it down. Three hundred and fifty words amounting to,

I suspected, a pile of crap. So, i decided to read it to alvin and let him decide if it was

Any good at all.





(thomas reads.)





The butterfly. By thomas weaver.





Alvin

The butterfly’





Thomas

Yeah.





In a far off land

There lived a beautiful butterfly,

In a kingdom full of blossom covered trees

And winding through this paradise

A river danced along

And played with the constant summer breeze.





(thomas hesitates, losing confidence.)





Alvin

Keep going.





Thomas

The butterfly

Found a tiny branch at the riverside

And watched the water rushing who knows where.

Carefully he sheltered

From the power of the breeze

For surely it could toss him through the air.





‘i’m a butterfly,’

He said,

‘trivial and small

And in the greater scheme of things

I don’t mean much at all,

So i’ll flap my wings to stretch myself

And just enjoy the view.

I’m a butterfly, what more can i do’’





One afternoon the butterfly asked the river,

"madam, what makes you hurry so’

What splendid destination

Are you rippling toward’

Where, oh where do you go’"





The river said, ‘i’m headed for the ocean,

And the summer breeze inspires me to race.

My friend, you’d love the ocean.

It’s remarkable to see.

Won’t you join our friendly chase’’





‘i’m a butterfly,’

He said,

‘trivial and small

And in the greater scheme of things

I don’t mean much at all,

So i flap my wings to stretch myself

And just enjoy the view.

I’m a butterfly, what more can i do’’





So the butterfly, he dreamed of the ocean.

He longed to flutter high above the seas,

But there are dangers in the sky

For a tiny butterfly.

So from his branch

He asked a question of the breeze.





"what makes you chase the river

T’ward the ocean’"

Then the breeze told him a most amazing thing.

‘i’m simply made up of the currents in the air

That start from the movement of your wing,

Your tiny wing.’





‘you’re a butterfly my friend,

Powerful and strong

And i'm grateful for the way

You’ve always hurried me along.

When you flap your wings to stretch yourself

It might seem small to you

But you change the world

With everything you do.’





So he stretched his wings

And took off from the safety of his tree





And the butterfly finally saw the sea.
