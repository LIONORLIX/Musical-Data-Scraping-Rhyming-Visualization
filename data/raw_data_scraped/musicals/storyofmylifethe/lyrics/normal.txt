Thomas

And so i started writing. Anything and everything got put on paper.

A one-sentence preface...

Alvin

From a book i gave you.





Thomas

... Nudged me into a "neat career" as...





(he tears the page from the book.)





This isn't about me.





Alvin

Isn't it?





(thomas writes.)





Thomas

We are gathered to honor the life of alvin kelby.





Write what you know tom.

Write what you know.





(alvin selects another story and reads.)





Alvin

A stupid squashable bug.

A story about alvin and thomas.





Thomas

One afternoon, when i was fourteen,

I borrowed one of the magazines my father kept hidden in his nightstand.

I found alvin at the bridge by the falls staring intently at a butterfly.





(alvin steps into the past.)





Alvin

Tom. Watch this. They say that every time this butterfly flaps

It causes a tiny ripple in the air that can spread out and grow and change wind currents and

Weather patterns. They call it the butterfly effect. One flap could cause a blizzard in africa.





Thomas

To any other fourteen-year-old, alvin was a freak.





Alvin

I prefer the term "individual". Watch.





(thomas joins alvin. They watch the butterfly for a very long time. Nothing happens.)





Thomas

This is ridiculous.





Al, we’re starting high school in the fall

And you don’t seem prepared for that at all.

When everything is different

And the kids are mostly new.

You’ll see high school can be hard

On ‘individuals’ like you.





Alvin

Whoa. It's flapping.





Thomas

It’s a bug. A stupid, squashable bug.





Thomas

Look at this magazine, alvin.

See what regular guys are obsessed with.

You’re chasing insects

While you could be learning

What miss april tattooed her giant breast with.





(thomas shows alvin the cover of the magazine.)





Alvin

Get that out of my face.





Thomas

Being eccentric was fine

When it was just junior high.

If you want to fit in at high school, al,

Be normal.

Just try.





(thomas opens the magazine.)





Miss april... Likes action movies, stock car racing, and soup.





You like soup.





Alvin

She looks uncomfortable. Crap. Where’d the butterfly go?





Thomas

You’re gonna need to be different alvin.

You gotta draw less attention.

It’s better to just be like one of the crowd

Than a dweeb who dropped in

From the fifth dimension.





(alvin sees the butterfly.)

Alvin

There you are.





Thomas

Wouldn’t you like to be more

Than just ‘that weird kelby kid’?

You could fly under the radar, al

Be normal.





Alvin

Shhhhh!





Thomas

No more playing with bugs, alvin.

No more wearing your dead mother’s robe.

There are bullies and thugs, alvin.

Every one a potential alvin-o-phobe.





(the butterfly flaps.)





Alvin

Whoa!





Thomas

The tiniest transgression,

Like to stick out or rebel,

Will destroy their first impression

And turn high school into hell.





Al!





Alvin

Sh!



Thomas

I threw miss april at the butterfly.





(thomas does so. The butterfly flies away.)





Alvin

No! It’s flapping. It’s flapping. It’s flapping a lot. Oh my god.

There’s no telling what chain of events you just set into motion.





Thomas

Nothing's gonna happen!





Alvin

Don’t move. If a stupid, squashable bug can have that kind of power, what about us?





Thomas

Alvin moved his finger.

Alvin

What do you think that did?





Thomas

And then his hand.





Alvin

Or that?





Thomas

And then his whole arm.





Alvin

Or that?





Thomas

Until he was flapping around like some crazed pterodactyl.





Alvin

Woo hoo! Look at me tom. I’m changing the weather. I’m redirecting the jet stream.

I’m melting the polar ice caps.





Thomas

Nothing is changing! You look like an idiot!





Nobody said it was easy, alvin

Nobody said it was pretty.

And hearing this stuff from a friend may be hard,

But not knowing at all would be twice as shitty.

You’ll get through high school unnoticed

Then you’ll thank me, you’ll see.

So don’t be the guy who bucks every trend





Alvin

Give me that magazine.





(alvin picks up the magazine and examines it closely.)





Thomas

Who i have to justify and defend.





Alvin

I didn’t see that before.





Thomas

If you want to keep being my best friend

Be normal...





(alvin plucks something from the cover.)

Alvin

A caterpillar.





Thomas

... Like...





(thomas selects a story and alvin falls to the ground writhing in pain.)





Alvin

Tom!





Thomas

Bullies and thugs.





Alvin

Tom!





Thomas

A story about alvin kelby.





Alvin

Tom!





Thomas

For our tenth grade halloween party,

Alvin came to school dressed as his mother’s ghost again.

Bathrobe and all.





Alvin

Tom!





Thomas

What was cute at six was just weird at fifteen.





Alvin

Tom!





Thomas

Donnie carter chased alvin all the way to the bridge and, by the time i got there,

Had him pinned to the ground and was pummeling him mercilessly.





Alvin

Tom!





Thomas

Get off him!





Alvin

Tom!





Thomas

I said get off him now!

(thomas helps alvin to his feet.)





Alvin

He’s got my robe, tom.





Thomas

Give him the robe, donnie.





Alvin

Please give it back.





Thomas

Give it back now.





Alvin

No. Don’t do that. No no no. Please. Please. Don’t!





Thomas

Donnie threw the robe over the side of the bridge and ran away.

We watched it disappear over the falls.





But seriously al, what were you thinking?
