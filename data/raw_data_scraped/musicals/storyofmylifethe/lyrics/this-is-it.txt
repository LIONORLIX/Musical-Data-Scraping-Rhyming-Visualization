This Is It


Alvin

There's gotta be thousands of stories in this head of yours, tom.

Don’t look for one that isn't there.





(alvin looks around at the mess of papers and books strewn about in thomas’s mind.)





This is it tom

This is all there is.

And isn’t it amazing’





Here we sit, tom.

Forever tossing branches off a bridge.





Here we’re frozen at ten.

Here we’re awkward young men.

And you filed away these memories

Bit by bit.





Now look again.





You wanted a story, tom

Well this,

All around you,

This is it.





Admit, tom

You expected more.

But isn’t this refreshing’

This is it, tom.

Sure, it’s nothing like the picture on the box.





And no secrets exist,

In some moment you missed,

Just accept that sometimes pieces

Might not fit.





And that’s okay.





‘Cause all that you needed, tom

Is here.

All around you,

This is it.





Look at them all. Stories about you. Stories about me. Stories about us.

Just waiting for you to pick them and write them down.





You are a writer.

Take what you know.

Here there's a lifetime of moments and details

Now you make them blossom and grow.





Find what’s important.





Thomas

Find what’s important.





Alvin

Help it to thrive.





Thomas

Help it to thrive.





Alvin

When you rearrange them and tell them

You keep all our memories and stories alive.





Thousands of stories





Thomas

Thousands of stories





Both

Constantly new.





Alvin

So our stories remain





Thomas

Stories remain





Alvin

Full of laughter and pain.





Thomas

Mixed with capra and twain.



Alvin

Told by you.





You and me, tom

This is all we get.

And wasn’t it exciting’

But don’t you see, tom

It isn’t really over, after all.





Just like stones in a lake

And the ripples they make

Stories carry on through time

And never quit.





It’s up to you.





This isn’t my story now

It’s yours.

Look around you.

This is it.





This is you.

This is me.

This is love.

This is life.

This is it.
