The Greatest Gift


Alvin

The greatest gift.

A story about alvin and thomas.





Thomas

Alvin and his father lived on the second floor above his father's bookstore.





Alvin

It was called the writer's block - new and used books.





Thomas

One christmas eve,

Alvin and i made snow angels and watched frank capra's it's a wonderful life.





Alvin

Our annual tradition.





Thomas

Then alvin took me downstairs to the bookstore. We were eleven.





(they take a step into the past.)





Alvin

Trust me.





Thomas

What are we doing’





Alvin

We're going to pick out a book for your christmas present.





Thomas

Cool. Which one’





Alvin

I don't know, but it's somewhere in this mystical place.





Thomas

Mystical place’





Alvin

Mystical place.





Thomas

It’s a bookstore.





Alvin

No. It’s a great and powerful force capable of extraordinary feats.





Thomas

Alvin's father was known for having the uncanny knack

Of finding the perfect book for each of his customers.

Of course, alvin saw things... Differently.





Alvin

Every day

People come into this bookstore.

Never knowing it was built

On sacred hollowed ground.





Thomas

Don't you mean ‘hallowed’’





Alvin

They travel here from all around.

Poor souls looking for stories.





Thomas

Where's my present’





Alvin

These desperate pilgrims enter this shrine. My father says...





‘good afternoon,’





Or ‘morning’ as the case may be.





‘i’m the owner of this bookstore.

Can i help you please?’

And they say, ‘not right now sir, thanks a lot.

But i’ll peruse the books you’ve got.

I’m just looking for stories.’





So dad allows them to search the stacks.

And they hunt and browse

And they read the backs.





But eventually,

Inevitably,

They ask for dad’s advice.





They talk a little.





Then he gets this look all dazed and queer.

And he mumbles things i can't quite hear.





(alvin imitates his father’s mumbling.)





Then, like a shot,

He goes right to the perfect spot

And finds their special book,

The one distinctive book,

The story that will change that person’s life.





You see’





Thomas

See what’

Alvin

This store speaks through my father. He's a conduit. He's an instrument.

He's a vessel. And i am his son. I too hear the prophetic whisper of the bookstore spirit.

I will now attempt to use my ancestral gifts to guide you to your present.





(alvin listens intently for the prophetic whisper.)





Thomas

You couldn’t just get me a model airplane?





Alvin

Shhh!





Speak to me

Noble spirit of the bookstore.

This is alvin here.





Thomas

And thomas.





Alvin

Is there something you can recommend

As a gift for thomas, my best friend?

Can you find him a story?





(alvin listens again.)





Thomas

Do you hear anything yet?





Alvin

No.





Wait! It needs... Something. It needs both of us.





Thomas

What do we do’





Alvin

Now we stand up straight looking shy and meek.





Thomas

Now we stand up straight looking shy and meek.





Alvin

And we humbly wait for the store to speak.





Thomas

And we humbly wait for the store to speak.





Both

Soon we will hear the answer

That we're preparing to receive.





Alvin

Now the next part’s not entirely clear.

It’s the part where dad gets dazed and queer.





Thomas

I think you nailed that part.





Alvin

I see... I see... I see a guy wearing cardboard wings,

A coat hanger halo, carrying a bell and a homemade book...





Wait!

Holy cow!

I know which book to give you now.





Thomas

Well.





Alvin

You’ll be grateful that i interceded.

And found the book you never knew you needed.





Thomas

Come on.





Alvin

The story that will change my best friend’s life.





(alvin plucks a book from the shelf and hands it to thomas.)





Thomas

The adventures of tom sawyer.

By mark twain.

A book report by tommy weaver.

Sixth grade.





(thomas addresses his sixth grade class.)





I got this book from my friend alvin.

It's a really good story but my favorite part is in the pre-face. It goes like this.





(he opens the book and reads.)





‘part of my plan has been to try to pleasantly remind adults of what they once were themselves,

And what queer enterprises they sometimes engaged in. The author. Hartford.

Eighteen seventy-six.’

(he closes the book.)
