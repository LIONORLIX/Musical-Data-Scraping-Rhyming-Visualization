Angels In the Snow


Alvin

What's that’





Thomas

A work in progress.





(alvin takes the pages and reads.)





Alvin

"every christmas eve we’d make angels in the snow, just like every other kid has done.

We’d stretch out our arms and legs. Then we’d wave them to and fro, in a halo of the

Late december sun."





"and once a year we believed

There was magic alive in the air

For the angels we made lying there."





Hm. I like this.





"proudly we’d create

Our two angels in the snow

With reverential robes and perfect wings.

We’d spend hours in the yard

All those christmases ago

And when at last they were complete

We felt like kings.





Then as the sun disappeared..."





(alvin realizes that this is all thomas has written.)





This is it, tom’





(thomas takes the pages from alvin and searches for words to complete the sentence.)





Thomas

Then as the sun disappeared...

And with snow down the back of our pants

We would wait for our angels to dance.





(thomas tosses the pages into the air creating a blizzard of papers.

The blizzard becomes a gentle snowfall.)





The icy wind would whip the snow from the ground





Alvin

And the trees would moan a sweet celestial sound.





Thomas

Then the angel souls were wide awake





Both

And alive on every single flake.





They whirled all around us

As we stood like stone.

Thousands of angels with lives of their own.





Each one with a separate story

Joining in one burst of glory.





Thomas

But then the snowflakes scattered and they flew

And our angels did too.





Both

Every christmas eve

We’d make angels in the snow





Thomas

And every year we’d watch them disappear.





Alvin

They’d disappear.





Thomas

But i know that they’ll return

And though the years may come and go

When i need to have them with me they’ll be here.





(alvin looks thomas in the eye with reassurance.)





Alvin

They’ll be here.





Thomas

They’ll be here.





Alvin

They’ll be here.





Both

Swirling round and around

In a magical christmas eve glow.

The way they did then

Back when we were just ten

All our angels again

In the snow.





(thomas and alvin embrace one final time and alvin vanishes.

Thomas finds himself once again in the funeral chapel.

He goes to the podium, closes his notebook and speaks.)





Thomas

We are gathered to honor the life of alvin kelby. He was my best friend.





Let me tell you a story about alvin...
