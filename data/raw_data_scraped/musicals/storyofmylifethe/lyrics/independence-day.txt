Independence Day


Alvin

This is it, tom.

This is it.





Thomas

The morning before the big trip.





Alvin

Twenty-four hours and i will be there.





Thomas

All i could think was... Boy this day came fast.

Alvin

To ruffle your feathers and get in your hair.





Thomas

All i could think was... I have things to take care of.





Alvin

The whole town can perish, i don’t even care.





Thomas

But all i could say was... See you tomorrow.





Alvin

This is it, tom.

This is it.





I never thought this day would actually come.





This morning i finally believed it.

I woke up and felt it begin.





"i’m shaking the dust of this

Crummy old town off my feet."





Take that, george bailey!





I'll make up a sign for the bookstore

And hang it where people come in

Saying ‘closing for christmas.

The owner is hitting the street.’





Look, i’ll never be a world traveler.

I just wasn’t built that way.

Still, this could be my independence day.





Thomas

Aren't you blowing this a little out of proportion’





Alvin

I think of the times throughout history

A day unremarkably dawned

Then one man was seized

By the restless desire to explore.





He looked up and scanned the horizon

And wondered what might lie beyond.

Then hoisted his anchor

And sailed for some uncharted shore.





Well now my destiny’s calling,

And i can hear it say

This could be my independence day.





Thomas

It's just a trip to the city, al.





Alvin

Of course you wouldn’t understand.





This is a feeling you must feel every day

As publishing’s latest man-of-the-hour.





Four bestsellers and counting, tom.





I really can’t compete with your resume.





But something deep is stirring

And shifting inside.

The boundaries are blurring

And opening wide.

It's suddenly occurring

That finally i deserve

To stray and reach and yearn

And dare to say

It might just be my turn.





It’s rare that you notice a moment

The moment it’s hurrying by

And instantly frame it

And say that’s when everything changed.





But now, there’s a moment approaching.

I’m staring it straight in the eye.

Prepared for a future

Of moments that aren’t prearranged.





Old george bailey was cheated

He never left his town.

Beaten down and defeated

He even tried to drown.

But look at me, i’ve been treated

To life turned upside-down.

Welcome to my independence day.





This is it, tom.

This is it.





Thomas

All i could think was... I never told ann he was coming.





Alvin

Christmas, the two of us, just like before.





Thomas

All i could think was... I never told alvin i'm engaged.





Alvin

Like back in my living room over the store.





Thomas

All i could think was... Things here have gotten complicated.





Alvin

Who says the holidays have to be more’





Thomas

But all i could say was...





Alvin

This is it, tom.

This is...





Thomas

Al. Don't come.





(silence.)





Alvin

Why not’





Thomas

It's not a good time. Al’ What do you think, al’





Alvin

This is it, tom

Me and you.





Thomas

The next time that we said goodbye





Alvin

If you commit, tom

You see it through.





Thomas

Why is it always goodbye’





Goodbye, al.





Alvin

Goodbye, tom.





Thomas

Relationships thrive or dissolve

Without our knowing why.

And somehow goodbye became easy.





Wait! Let me explain. It really wasn't a good time. I...
