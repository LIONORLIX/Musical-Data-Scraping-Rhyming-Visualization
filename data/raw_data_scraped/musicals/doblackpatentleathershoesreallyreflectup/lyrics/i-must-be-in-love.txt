I Must Be in Love


Holy smokes, who'd of guessed

She picked me out from all the rest

I'll probably strike out on an outside pitch

You know, one of these days I'm bound to get lucky

And I just might strike it rich



I must be in love

I feel like a hero

Just won the game a hundred to zero



Is it a fluke, is it a crush

The things that I'm thinking could make a kid blush

I can't be, but I must be



They say that love hurts

Don't tell me, I know so

Stung by the pitch, like Minnie Minoso

I'll take my base, drive in a run

Can't hide my feelings and they've only begun

And I feel like dancing too close



Here's to the fun you find at a mixer

And here's to the nuns for making us mix

Got to be cool, I'll try to act older

I feel like a fool 'cause I just wanna hold her



I must be in love

Lord, make me a winner

Have mercy on this unoriginal sinner

Teach me the rules, I'll play the game

Humor or rumor, to me it's the same

I can't be, but I must be, in love



Here's to the nuns for kernels of wisdom

And here's to the father for words to the wise

Can a romance fit into the system

Won't somebody guide me

Explain what's inside me



I must be in love

She gave me a "hello"

A major league star can't afford to be mellow

Finally at bat, now it's my turn

And beginners in love have a whole lot to learn

I can't be, but I must be, in love
