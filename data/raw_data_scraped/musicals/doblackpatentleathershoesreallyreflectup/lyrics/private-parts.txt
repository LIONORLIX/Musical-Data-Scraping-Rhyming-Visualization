Private Parts


*Father*

There'll be changes in your bodies

and temtations in your paths

you're voices will get lower

and you'll need to take more baths.

so imitate the saints

and purify your hearts

and ignore the urges

of your Private Parts



Don't think lude thoughs

about a womans form

eternity's a long time

and hell get's afoly warm

oh, your idle hand will get you into trouble

don't pay attention to your

Private Parts



Don't touch yourselves

no matter how you urn

not even just a little

or you'll burn burn burn

you better leap into an ice cold shower

and don't pay attention to your

(*whipers*)Private parts



Sex is for procreation

it's not used for recreation



no you can't hide you'r habbits from your family and your friends from the first touch your secret starts to show.

first the pimples

then the warts

your growth becomes stunted

your brain turns to jelly



*Students*

till the sham of our error

turns to horror then to terror



*Father*

When the hair upon your palm begins to grow!!!



so keep your mind above the belt

and your thoughts out of the sewer

cause an evil think's just as guilty

as an evil doer

oh your private parts with get you into trouble



*all

Keep them out of sight

keep them out of mind

we've got to do whats right

or end up deaf, dumb, and blind!



*Father*

so Don't pay attention to your



*students*
