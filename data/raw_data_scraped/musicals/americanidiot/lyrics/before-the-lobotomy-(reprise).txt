Before the Lobotomy (Reprise)


TUNNY, CHASE, BEN, and JOSHUA:

Dreaming

I was only dreaming

Of another place and time

Where my family's from



TUNNY, CHASE, and JOSHUA:

Singing

I can hear them singing

When the rain has washed away

All thses scattered dreams



TUNNY and CHASE:

Dying

Everybody's dying

Hearts are washed in misery

Drenched in gasoline



TUNNY:

Laughing

There is no more laughing

Songs of yesterday now live

In the underground.
