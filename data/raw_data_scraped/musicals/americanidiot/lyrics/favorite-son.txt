Favorite Son


JOSHUA:

He hit the ground running



WOMEN:

At the speed of light



JOSHUA:

The star was brightly shining



WOMEN:

Like a neon light



JOSHUA

It's your favorite son

It's your favorite son

A fixture on the talkshows,

To the silver screen

From here to Colorado,

He's a sex machine



It's your favorite son

It's your favorite son

But isn't it a drag?

Isn't it a drag?

Isn't it a drag?

its pretty but it's sad,

but isn't it a drag?



A clean-cut All-American

Really ain't so clean

His royal auditorium

Is a murder scene



It's your favorite son

It's your favorite son

But isn't it a drag?

Isn't it a drag?

Isn't it a drag?

It's pretty but it's sad,

but isn't it a drag?



Well no one says it's fair

Turn a teenage lush

To a millionaire



Now where's your f***ing champion?

On a panty raid

He's not the All-American

That you thought you paid

It's your favorite son

It's your favorite son
