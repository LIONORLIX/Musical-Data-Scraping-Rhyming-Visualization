Before the Lobotomy


TUNNY:

Dreaming

I was only dreaming

Of another place and time

Where my family's from



CHASE:

Singing

I can hear them singing

When the rain has washed away

All these scattered dreams



JOSHUA:

Dying

Everybody'd dying

Hearts are washed in misery

Drenched in gasoline



BEN:

Laughing

There is no more laughing

Songs of Yesterday now live

In the underground.
