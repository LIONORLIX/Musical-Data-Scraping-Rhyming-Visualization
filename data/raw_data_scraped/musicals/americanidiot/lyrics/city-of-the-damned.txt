City of the Damned


TUNNY:

At the center of the earth

in the parking lot

Of the 7-11 where I was taught

The motto was just a lie

It says: "Home is Where Your Heart Is"

But what a shame

'Cause everyone's heart doesn't beat the same.

We're beating out of time



TUNNY, JOHNNY, AND WILL:

City of the dead



TUNNY:

At the end of another lost highway

Signs misleading to nowhere



TUNNY, JOHNNY, AND WILL:

City of the damned



TUNNY:

Lost children with dirty faces today

No one really seems to care

I read the graffiti in the athroom stall



JOHNNY:

Like the holy scriptures in a shopping mall



TUNNY:

And so it seemed to confess



WILL:

It didn't say much, but it only confirmed



TUNNY:

That the center of the earth

Is the end of the world



TUNNY, JOHNNY, AND WILL

And I could really care less

City of the dead



TUNNY:

At the end of another lost highway

Signs misleading to nowhere



TUNNY, JOHNNY, AND WILL:

City of the damned.



TUNNY:

Lost children with dirty faces today

No one really seems to care
