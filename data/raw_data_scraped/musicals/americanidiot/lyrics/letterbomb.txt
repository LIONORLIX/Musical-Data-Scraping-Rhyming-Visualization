WHATSERNAME:

Where have all the bastards gone?

The underbelling stacks up ten high

The dummy failed the crash test

Collecting unemployment check

The flunky only along for the ride



Where have all the riots gone

As the city's motto gets pulverized?

"What's in love that's now in debt?"

on your birth certificate

So strike the f***ing match

to light this fuse!



The town bishop's and extortionist

And he don't even know that you exist

Standing still whe it's do or die

You better run for you f***ing life!



WHATSERNAME and WOMEN:

It's not over till you're underground

It's not over before it's too late

This city's burning: "It's not my burden"

It's not over before it's too late



WHATSERNAME:

There is nothing left to analyze

Where will all the martyrs go

When the virus cures itself?

And when will we all go when it's too late?



No don't look ack?

You're not the Jesus of Suburbia



WHATSERNAME and WOMEN:

The St. Jimmy is a figment of

Your father's rage and your mother's love

Made me the idiot America!



It's not over 'till you're underground

It's not over before it's too late

This city's burning: "It's not my burden"

It's not over before it's too late



She said "I can't take this place,

I'm leaving it behind"

She said "I can't take this town,

I'm leaving you tonight"
