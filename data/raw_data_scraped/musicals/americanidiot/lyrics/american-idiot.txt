American Idiot


Don't want to be an American Idiot

Don't want a nation under the new media

Hey, can you hear the sound of hysteria?

The subliminal mind f*** America



Welcome to a new kind of tension

All across the alienation

Where everything isn't meant to be O.K.



Television dreams of tomorrow

We're not the ones meant to follow

For that's enough to argue



Maybe I'm the f***** America

I'm not a part of a redneck agenda

Now everybody, do the propaganda!

And sing along to the age of paranoia



Welcome to a new kind of tension

All across the alienation

Where everything isn't meant to be O.K.

Television dreams of tomorrow

We're not the ones meant to follow

For that's enough to argue



Don't want to be an American idiot

One nation controlled by the media

Information age of hysteria

Calling out to idiot America



Welcome to a new kind of tension

All across the alienation

Where everything isn't meant to be O.K.

Television dreams of tomorrow

We're not the ones meant to follow

For that's enough to argue
