Holiday


TUNNY:

Say!



JOHNNY:

Hey!

Hear the sound of the falling rain

Coming down like an Armageddon flame



TUNNY:

The shame



JOHNNY:

The ones who died without a name



TUNNY:

Hear the dogs howing out of key

To a hymn called "Faith and Misery"

And bleed

The company clost the war today



JOHNNY and TUNNY:

I beg to dream and differ

From the hollow lies

This is the dawning of the rest of our lives



JOHNNY:

On holiday



ANDREW:

Hear the drum pounding out of time



THEO:

Another protester has crossed the line



BRIAN:

To find the money's on the other side



GERARD and CHASE:

Can I get another amen?



GERARD:

There's a flag wrapped around a score of men



BEN:

A gag



ALL:

A plastic bag on a monument

I beg to dream and differ

From the hollow lies

This is the dawning of the rest of our lives

On holiday



ANDREW:

The representative from Jingletown has the floor



THEO:

Zieg heil to the president gasman

Bombs away is your punishment

Pulverize the Eiffel Towers

Who criticize your government

Bang bang goes the broken glass and

Kill all the f**s that don't agree

Trials by fire setting fire

Is not a way that's meant for me

Just 'cause

Just 'cause, because we're outlaws, yeah!



ALL:

I beg to dream and differ

From the hollow lies

This is the dawning of the rest of our lives

I beg to dream and differ

From the hollow lies

This is the dawning of the rest of our lives

This is our lives on holiday!
