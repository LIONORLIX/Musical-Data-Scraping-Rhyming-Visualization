When It's Time


JOHNNY:

The words get trapped in my mind

I'm sorry I don't take the time

To feel the way I do

'Cause from the first day you came into my life

My time ticks around you

But then I need your voice

As a key to unlock all

The love thats trapped in of me

So tell me when it's time

To say I love you



All I want is you to understand

That when I take your hand

Its 'cause I want to

We are all born in a world of doubt

But there's no doubt

I figured out I love you



And I feel lonely for

All the losers that will never

Take the time to say

What is really on their mind instead

They just hide away

Yet they'll never have

Someone like you to guide them

And help along the way

So tell me when its time

To say I love you

So tell me when its time

To say I love you
