Dearly Beloved


HEATHER:

Dearly beloved, are you listening?

I can't rememer a word that you were saying

Are we demented? Or am I disturbed?

The space that's in-between insane and insecure



Oh therapy, can you please fill the void?

Am I retarded or am I just overjoyed?

Nobody's perfect and I stand accused

For lack of a better word, and that's my best excuse
