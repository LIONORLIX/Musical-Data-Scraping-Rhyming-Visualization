The Death of St. Jimmy


ST. JIMMY:

My heart is beating from me

I am standing all alone

Please call me only

If you are coming home

Waste another year flies by

Waste a night or two

You taught me how to live



In the streets of shame

Where you've lost your dreams in the rain

There's no sign of hope

The stems and seeds of the last of the dope



ST. JIMMY and JOHNNY:

There's a glow of light

The St. Jimmy is the spark in the night

Bearing gifts and trust

The fixture in the city of lust



ST. JIMMY:

What the hell's your name

What's your pleasure, what is your pain

Do you dream too much?



ST. JIMMY and JOHNNY:

Do you think what you need is a crutch?

In the crowd of pain

St. Jimmy comes without any shame

He says "we're f***ed up"

But we're not the same

And Mom and dad are the ones you can blame



ST. JIMMY:

Jimmy died today

He blew his brains out into the bay

In the state of mind



ST. JIMMY and JOHNNY

In my own private suicide
