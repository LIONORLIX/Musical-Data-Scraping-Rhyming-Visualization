Best Thing for You


Please let me say from the start

I don't pretend to be smart

I just suggest what I think best

Having your int'rest at heart



I only want what's the best thing for you

And the best thing for you would be me



I've been convinced after thinking it through

That the best thing for you would be me



Ev'ry day

To myself I say

Point the way

What will it be



I ask myself what's the best thing for you

And myself and I seem to agree

That the best thing for you would be me
