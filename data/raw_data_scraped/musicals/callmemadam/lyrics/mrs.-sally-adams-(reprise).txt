Mrs. Sally Adams (Reprise)


Missus Sally Adams

Requests the pleasure of your company

At a supper and dance

A coming home party

That she's giving at her house tonight



Missus Sally Adams

Has lost some of her popularity

And the chances are

That a few somebodys

Will be missing at her house tonight



Missus Sally Adams

Is back among us very suddenly

And we're very anxious

To hear what happened there across the sea



We are simply delighted

And happy without a doubt

To be gathering there

Ev'ryone is excited

For maybe we'll hear about

Sally's foreign affair



God bless America

For Missus Sally Adams

Who wants the pleasure of your company

Glad are we

To accept and root for

Missus Sally Adams

Queen of all the madams

Madam Ambassador
