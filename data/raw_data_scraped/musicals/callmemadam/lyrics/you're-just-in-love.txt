You're Just in Love


[Kenneth:]

I hear singing and there's no one there

I smell blossoms and the trees are bare

All day long I seem to walk on air

I wonder why

I wonder why

I keep tossing in my sleep at night

And what's more I've lost my appetite

Stars that used to twinkle in the skies

Are twinkling in my eyes

I wonder why



[Sally:]

You don't need analyzing

It is not so surprising

That you feel very strange but nice

Your heart goes pitter patter

I know just what's the matter

Because I've been there once or twice

Put your head on my shoulder

You need someone who's older

A rubdown with a velvet glove

There is nothing you can take

To relieve that pleasant ache

You're not sick

You're just in love
