Mrs. Sally Adams


Missus Sally Adams

Requests the pleasure of your company

At a supper and dance

A farewell party

That she's giving at her house tonight



Missus Sally Adams

The queen of Washington society

Anybody at all

Who's anybody

Will be gathered at her house tonight



Missus Sally Adams

The new ambassador to cross the sea

Missus Sally Adams

Who says "The hell with formality"



Missus Sally Adams

Missus Sally Adams

Makes 'em sing at her parties

And each guest becomes a ham

Giving all that he's got

It may not please the smarties

But she doesn't give a damn

If they like it or not

She is liable to blurt out

The thing that she should ignore

But nobody will care

She can iron a shirt out

That's stuffed with a senator

Or a Congressman there



God bless America

For Missus Sally Adams

Who wants the pleasure of your company

Glad are we

To accept and root for

Missus Sally Adams

Queen of all the madams

Madam Ambassador
