Something to Dance About


An old hand at giving parties I've learned an awful lot

The best reason for a party

And what keeps it boiling hot

An occasion when you've got



Something to dance about

Someone to dance it with

Something to dance it to

To a fox-trot or a waltz



Put on your dancing shoes

Here comes some happy news

Break up in twos and twos

To a fox-trot or a waltz



You and someone have parted

And your lonely heart yearns

While you're there broken hearted

Suddenly he returns



That's something to dance about

With someone to dance it with

Pick something to dance it to

To a fox-trot or a waltz

To a Charleston or a waltz

To a Tango or a waltz



[Blues tempo:]

Dance to the blues

Something to dance about

Someone to dance it with

Something to dance it to Blues



[Rhumba tempo:]

Dance it to a rhumba

Ah



[Coda:]

To a fox-trot, Charleston, Tango or a waltz

Ooh-ah, ooh-ah
