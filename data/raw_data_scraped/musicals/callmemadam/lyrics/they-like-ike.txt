They Like Ike


The presidential year will soon be drawing near

The people soon will choose their fav'rite son

I wonder what they'll do in nineteen fifty-two

I wonder who they'll send to Washington



They like Ike

And Ike is good on a mike

They like Ike

-But Ike says he don't wanna



That makes Ike

The kind of feller they like

And what's more

They seem to think he's gonna



-But Harry won't get out

-They're in for plenty of fights

-Harry won't get out

-He's got squatter's rights



But there's Ike

And Ike is good on a mike

And they know

The votes that he can carry

-But don't forget there's Harry

But they like Ike



[2]

For nearly twenty years we've had the people's cheers

The Democrats continue to advance

Of course, they could arrange to make a sudden change

But none's around who seems to have a chance



Ta, ta, ta, ta, ta, ta

They like Ike

And Ike is good on a mike

They like Ike

-But Ike says he's not bidding



That makes Ike

The kind of feller they like

And what's more

They seem to think he's kidding



-But Harry won't consent

-They'll get a sock on the jaw

-Republican President?

-That's against the law



If it's Ike

Your Chief can go on a hike

And we boys

Will see he doesn't tarry

-Please don't do that to Harry!

But they like Ike



[3]

They won't take Saltonstall and Sasscer's chance is small

The same would go for Vandenburg and Taft

And Dewey's right in line with William Jennings Bryan

There isn't anyone that they can draft



Except for the fact that

They like Ike

And Ike is good on a mike

They like Ike

-But Ike says he won't take it



That makes Ike

The kind of feller they like

And what's more

They seem to think he'll make it



-But Harry's on the ground

-And should Republicans win

-When they come around

-He won't let them in



If it's Ike

Your Chief can get on his bike

And his things

A moving van will carry

-They can't do that to Harry!

But they like Ike
