Can You Use Any Money Today?


Money, money, money, money, money, money

Can you use any dollars today?

Money, money, money, money, money, money

We've so much that it gets in our way



In our Treas'ry there's a mighty sum

Millions we've subtracted from

The envelopes that hold our take home pay

Can you use any money today?



Home in the states underground there's a cave full of gold

Back up a truck and we'll fill it with all it can hold

Take ten million and please don't fuss

If you find it can't be spent

You can lend it right back to us

And we'll pay you seven percent



Money, money, money, money, money, money

Uncle Sam puts it right on the line

And if that feller with whiskers ever should decline

You can have mine

All of mine

You can have mine
