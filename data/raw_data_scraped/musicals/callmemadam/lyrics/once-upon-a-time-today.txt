Once upon a Time Today


I would like you to listen

Pay attention and listen

To a story that's old, but never stale

I would like you to listen

Pay attention and listen

To a twentieth century fairy tale



Once there was a princess

Once there was a guy

And they fell in love one wonderful day



But she was a princess

He was just a guy

So there was the royal devil to pay



They were ordered not to speak to one another

And they knew the sorrow that would bring

Still, they promised not to speak to one another

But they didn't promise not to sing



So beneath her window tenderly he sang

All the things he promised never to say

Once upon a time today



He collected lots of corny little phrases

Like "I love you, dear" and "You're for me"

But he found that when he set them all to music

They were just as good as poetry



So beneath her window tenderly he sang

"How about that happy ending in May?"

Once upon a time today
