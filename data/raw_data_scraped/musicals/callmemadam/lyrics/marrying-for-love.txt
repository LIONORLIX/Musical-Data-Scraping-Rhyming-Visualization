Marrying for Love


Ten generations of Constantins

Lived very comf'table lives

They were contented to live in style

Supported by their wives

Daughters of men who were wealthy

Fitted them like a glove

They all married for money

I mean to marry for love



It's an old-fashioned idea, marrying for love

And that old-fashioned idea's what I'm thinking of



Where there's love, poets have said

Two can live as one

That's an old-fashioned idea

But it's being done



When I find the man that I'm crazy about

There's much that I could do without

But I couldn't do without love



Just an old-fashioned romance with a moon above

A romance, one that will end marrying for love

That's the kind of love

That I'm thinking of



[alternate bridge for male:]

If she must have gold, let it be in her hair

Rubies, let them be in her lips

Diamonds, let them shine in her eyes
