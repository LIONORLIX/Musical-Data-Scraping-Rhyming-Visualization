Lichtenburg


I don't think you know much about us

Except, of course, our famous Lichtenburg cheese

I know very well you enjoy it

And we would enjoy it too

But we can't afford it for we must have money

And so we send it to you

But Lichtenburg won't be offended

We'll manage to stay alive

We're not very touchy

This quaint little duchy

That somehow seems to survive



Too small to be a city

Too big to be a town

Too poor to have an army

And too easy to knock down



Too little to sell across the seas

Babies and cheese are our main industries



Too slow to please the young folk

Too fast to please the old

Too many who have copper pennies

Too few who have gold



But somehow we manage to play the game

While the other lands keep changing hands

Old Lichtenburg stays the same





5.Can You Use Any Money Today?



Money, money, money, money, money, money

Can you use any money today?

Money, money, money, money, money, money

Nice new bills that we're giving away



There are photographs on ev'ry one

Lincoln, Grant and Washington

Or you might like the ones with Henry Clay

Can you use any money today?



Two million, four million, six million, ten

Take what you want, when it's gone you can come back again



Bills that haven't been printed yet

You can have them by the sack

Coins that haven't been minted yet

That you never have to give back



Money, money, money, money, money, money

Uncle Sam puts it right on the line

And if we ever run out of checks for him to sign

You can have mine

All of mine

You can have mine
