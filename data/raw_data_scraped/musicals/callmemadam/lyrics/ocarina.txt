Ocarina


Listen to the ocarina play

Listen, don't you seem to hear it say



Dance to the music of the ocarina

Ocarina, ocarina

Gretchen and Otto, Hans and Wilhelmina

Dance to the ocarina dance



Dance to the music of the sweet potata

Sweet potata, sweet potata

Cheeks gettin' redder than a ripe tomata

Dance to the ocarina dance



Listen and hear the notes escaping

Out of that tiny hole

Doesn't it please your soul?

Doesn't it say, "Dance the polka"?



Step to the music of the ocarina

Who refuses? Wilhelmina?

Wait till she listens to the ocarina

I know that Wilhelmina will
