The Tree


This man I know

Has an apple tree he's hoping will grow

day after day he waits

and what does he see?

Not one apple on the tree



This man I know

Works all winter

But the tree will not grow

Till late in Spring with still no Fruit to be found

He goes out to cut it down



Lo and behold

Like a miracle swept in from the sea

Lo and behold

There's a fog

So thick the man can't see

To cut the tree



Next morning he,

All excited he come runnin' to me,

Right there for all to see,

way up on a bough

Small and weak but hangin' on somehow

Is a baby apple now
