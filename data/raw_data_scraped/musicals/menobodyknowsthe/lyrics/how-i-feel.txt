How I Feel


Hard to tell you how I feel

Everything is so unreal

Lord, this life is a hard thing to get to



Saw my shadow on the wall

Saw my love nowhere at all

Saw my life as a hard thing to get through



When you're born, they carry you

When you're gone, they bury you

In between, you're on your own

Hard to stand there

All alone



Someone crying down the hall

Dying cries, they tell it all

Lord, this life is a hard thing to live

And harder, still,

To leave
