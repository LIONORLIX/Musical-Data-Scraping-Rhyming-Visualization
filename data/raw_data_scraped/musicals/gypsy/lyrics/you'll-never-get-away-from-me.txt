You'll Never Get Away From Me


Rose

Herbie, why don't you get angry on the outside,

instead of letting it settle in your stomach?



Herbie

Because I'm afraid.



Rose

Of me?



Herbie

Of me.



Rose

What do you mean?



Herbie

If ever let loose,

It'll end with me

Picking up and walking.



Rose

Only around

The block.



Herbie

No.



Rose

Don't say that.

You'll never get away from me.

You can climb the tallest tree.

I'll be there somehow.



True, you could say, "Hey, here's your hat."

But a little thing like that

couldn't stop me now.



I couldn't get away from you,

even if you told me to,

so go on and try.

Just try and you're gonna see

how you're gonna not at all

get away from me.



Herbie

Rose, I love you, but don't count your chickens.



Rose

Come dance with me.



Herbie

I warn you that I'm no Boy Scout.



Rose

Relax awhile, come dance with me.



Herbie

So don't think that I'm easy pickin'.



Rose

The music's so nice.



Herbie

Rose, 'cause I just may some day pick up and pack out.



Rose

Oh, no you don't. No, not a chance.

No arguments, shut up and dance.



Rose

You'll never get away from me.

You can climb the tallest tree.

I'll be there somehow.

True, you could say, "Hey, here's your hat."



Rose & Herbie

But a little



Herbie

thing like that

couldn't stop me now.



Rose & Herbie

I couldn't get away from you,

even if I wanted to.



Rose

Well, go on and try.

Just try



Herbie

Ah, Rose.



Rose

and you're gonna see



Herbie

Ah, Rose



Rose

how you're gonna not at all



Rose & Herbie

get away from me.
