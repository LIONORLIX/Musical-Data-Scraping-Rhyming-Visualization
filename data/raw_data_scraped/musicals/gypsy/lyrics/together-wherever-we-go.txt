Together Wherever We Go


Momma Rose

Wherever we go, whatever we do,

we're gonna go through it together.

We may not go far, but sure as a star,

wherever we are, it's together.



Wherever I go I know he goes.

Wherever I go I know she goes.

No fits, no fights, no feuds

and no egos, Amigos, together!



Through thick and through thin,

all out or all in.

And whether it's win, place or show.

With you for me and me for you,

we'll muddle through whatever we do.

Together, wherever we go.



Rose, Louise & Herbie

Wherever we go, whatever we do,

we're gonna go through it together.



Rose

Wherever we sleep, if prices are steep,



Herbie

We'll always sleep cheaper together.





Rose

Whatever the boat I row, you row.



HerbieA duo



Rose

Whatever the row I hoe, you hoe.



Louise

A trio.



Rose

And any I. O. U., I owe you-oh's?



Herbie

Who, me-oh? No, you-oh.



Louise

No, we-oh.





Rose, Louise & Herbie

Together!

We all take the bow



Rose

Including the cow,



Rose, Louise & Herbie

though business is lousy and slow.



Rose

With Herbie's vim, Louise's verve,





Louise & Herbie

Now all we need is someone with nerve.

Together, wherever,



Rose, Louise & Herbie

Together, wherever we go.





Rose

We go in a group,



Rose, Louise & Herbie

We tour in a troupe.

We land in the soup, but we know

the things we do, we do by threes.

A perfect team.



Rose

No, this way, Louise!

Together



Louise & Herbie
