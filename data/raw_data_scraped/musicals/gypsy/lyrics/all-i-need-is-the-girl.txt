All I Need Is the Girl


Take a flower, smell it, put it in my lapel

And I spot the audience!



Verse:

Once my clothes WERE shabby

Tailors CALLED me, "Cabbie"

Got so rough I TOOK a vow

Said this bum'LL

Be Beau Brummel

Now I'm smooth and SNAPPY

Now my tailor's happy

I AM the cats meow

My wardrobe is a wow!

Paris silk! HARRIS tweed!

There's only one thing I need...



Refrain:

Got my tweed crest

Got my best vest

All I need now is the girl

Got my striped tie

Got my hopes high

Got the time and the place

And I got rhythm

Now all I need is the girl to go with'M

If she'LL

just appear we'll

Take this big town for a WHIRL

And if she'LL ONLY say, "My darling I'm yours"

I'll throw away

My striped tie

And my best-PRESSED tweed

All I really need

Is the girl.



Patter:

[speaking] I start off easy, you see?

Now I'm more debonair...

Ssssssssssssssh! Aaaaah! Break ... Now! Yeah!

And I settle here... I start this step, see?

And then I build it... Double it!

She appears all in white and I take her hand,

Kiss it and lead her on the floor...

This step's good for the costume... A stair bit!

Dah dah dah dah...Dah dah dah dah yah dah...

Now we waltz, strings come in

And I lift her...Again... Once more!

And now the tempo changes and all the lights come up

And I build for the grand finale

Louise, that's it!

Come on over here...

Follow me... Faster! Charleston...

Again... Do it again! Ha ha ha!
