Rose's Turn


Rose

Here she is, boys!

Here she is, world!

Here's Rose!



Curtain up!

Light the lights!

Play it, boys!



Ya either got it, or ya ain't.

And, boys, I got it!

Ya like it?

Well, I got it!



Some people got it and make it pay.

Some people can't even give it away.

This people's got it

and this people's spreadin' it around!

You either have it

or you've had it!



Hello, everybody! My name is Rose! What's yours?

How do you like them eggrolls, Mr. Goldstone?

Hold your hats and hallelujah.

Mama's gonna show it to you.

Ready or not, shhh, here comes Mama.



Mama's talkin' loud.

Mama's doin' fine.

Mama's gettin' hot.

Mama's goin' stong.

Mama's movin' on.

Mama's all alone.

Mama doesn't care.

Mama's lettin' loose.

Mama's got the stuff.

Mama's lettin' go.

Mama?

Mama's got the stuff.

Mama's gotta move.

Mama's gotta go.

Mama? Mama?

Mama's gotta let go.



Why did I do it?

What did it get me?

Scrapbooks full of me in the background.

Give 'em love and what does it get ya?

What does it get ya?

One quick look as each of 'em leaves you.

All your life and what does it get ya?

Thanks a lot and out with the garbage,

They take bows and you're battin' zero.



I had a dream.

I dreamed it for you, June.

It wasn't for me, Herbie.

And if it wasn't for me

then where would you be,

Miss Gypsy Rose Lee?



Well, someone tell me, when is it my turn?

Don't I get a dream for myself?

Starting now it's gonna be my turn.

Gangway, world, get off of my runway!

Starting now I bat a thousand!

This time, boys, I'm taking the bows and



everything's coming up Rose!

Everything's coming up roses!

Everything's coming up roses

this time for me!

For me! For me! For me! For me! For me!

For me! Yeah!

[Rose takes the silent bows as Gypsy enters and applauds]



Rose

I was...trying out for you...New ideas you might wanna use...



Gypsy

You really would have been something, momma!



Rose

Do you think so?



Gypsy

If you had someone to push you like I had...



Rose

If I could have been...I would have been...

And that's show business!

I guess I did it for me...



Gypsy

Why, momma?



Rose

Just wanted to be noticed...



Gypsy

Like I wanted you to notice me!

I still do, momma!

[They embrace each other. Rose cries]



Gypsy

It's OK, momma! OK, Rose!



Rose

See... You look like you should speak French!



Gypsy

You're coming to that party with me...



Rose

No!



Gypsy

Come on!



Rose

Not like this.



Gypsy

Wear my fur I have a stole in my cabinet.



Rose

Well, maybe just for an hour or two...Hey, it looks better on me than it

does on you. Funny how we can both wear the same size!



Gypsy

Specially in mink.



Rose

You know...I had a dream last night. There was a big poster of a mother

and daughter, like the covers of the ladies magazines...



Gypsy

Yes, momma!



Rose

Only it was you and me wearing exactly the same gowns. It was an add for

Minsky, and the headline said: "MADAM ROSE...AND HER DAUGHTER GYPSY".
