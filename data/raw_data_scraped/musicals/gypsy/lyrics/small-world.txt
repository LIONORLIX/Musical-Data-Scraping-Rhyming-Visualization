you're a stranger who's come here,

come from another town.

Funny, I'm a stranger myself here.

Small world, isn't it?



Funny, you're a man who goes traveling

rather than settling down.

Funny, 'cause I'd love to go traveling.

Small world, isn't it?



We have so much in common,

it's a phenomenon.

Lucky, you're a man who likes children.

That's an important sign.

Lucky, I'm a woman with children.

Small world, isn't it?

Funny, isn't it small and funny and fine?
