Send a dozen to your mother.

Tomorrow's Mother's Day.

You can never replace her with a another.

No matter what they say!



[June]

Give her the earth!



[Louise]

Give her the earth!



[June]

That's what she's worth!



[Louise]

That's what she's worth!



[Both]

Give her a little something. She gave you birth.

And by this time net year, She may not be here.

Remember Mother's Day!
