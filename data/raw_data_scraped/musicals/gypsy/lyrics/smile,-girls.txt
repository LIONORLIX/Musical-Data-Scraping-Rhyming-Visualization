Smile, Girls


[Rose]

What you must keep in mind as the act curtains part

is the primary law of theatrical art.





Mainly, smile girls and you'll lay them in the isle girls.

If you smile girls they'll die on the spot.



Smile girls drive em crazy with your youth girls

Flash a tooth girls give them everything you got.

witch an' it an awful lot.





Smile girls  or we never gunna work girls.

Just a smirk girls might well save the day.



Get style girls and the customers will stay



So smile Angus, smile delorous,

Smile Phelma, smile whatever your name is.

Smile Ednis, smile Madre May Smile girls.



Make them think your being clever,

but whatever happens smile no matter what





When the scenery smacks you smile.

When a stage hen attacks you smile.

When they boo in the gallery smile.

When I don't pay your salary smile.

When the comedy's dying smile.

When you all feel like crying smile.

When tomato's are flying duck but smile.



Smile girls it only hurts a while girls.

If you smile girls, its sure to go away.

Get style girl even if you have to ham it.

but damn it smile Angus, smile Dolorous

smile Phelma, smile whatever your name is

smile Ednis, smile Madre may. Smile girls

and when the act begins to sag drag out the flag

and smile!
