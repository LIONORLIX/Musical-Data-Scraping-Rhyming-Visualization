Who Needs Him?


[ROSE]

Who needs him?

One up, one down.

This show?s been running for years.

It should have closed out of town.

One day it?s on. One day, it?s through.

And I?ve got twenty better things to do.



Who needs him?

Not me, oh no.

There will be others to come,

sure, and other to go.

They?re passing phases.

They can go to blazes!



Who needs them?

Who needs it?



Who needs him?

Who?
