Dainty June and Her Farmboys / Broadway


Farmboys

extra! Extra!

hey, look at

The headline

historical news

Is being made

Extra! Extra!

they're drawing

A red line

around the biggest scoop

Of the decade

a barrel of charm

a fabulous thrill

the biggest little headline

In vaudeville



presenting

in person

that 5' 2"

Bundle of dynamite

dainty...June

[drum roll]



June

Hello, everybody!

My name is June!

What's yours?



I have a moo cow

a new cow,

A true cow

named Caroline



Louise

moo, moo, moo, moo



June

she's an extra-special

friend of mine



Louise

moo, moo, moo, moo



June

I like everything

about her fine



Louise

moo, moo,

Moo, moo



June

she likes to moo in

The moonlight

when the moody moon

Appears

and when she moos in

The moonlight

gosh, it's moosic

To my ears

she's so moosical

she loves a man cow,

A tan cow

who can cow her

With a glance



Louise

moo, moo,

Moo, moo



June

when he winks at her

she starts to dance



Louise

moo, moo, moo, moo



June

it's what grown-ups call

A real romance



Louise

moo, moo, moo, moo



June

but if we moooved

To the city

or we settled

By the shore

she'd make the mooove

'cause she

Loves me more



Woman

Thank you very much.

That's all.



Rose

But we have a great finish.



Woman

I'm sure,

But mr. Grantziger--



Rose

Ah...hit it!



[music playing]



Farmboys

broadway

broadway

we miss it so

we're leaving soon

And taking June

to star her in a show

bright lights

white lights

rhythm and romance

the train is late,

So while we wait

we're gonna do

A little dance



June

Broadway

Broadway

how great you are

I'll leave the farm

With all its charm

to be a Broadway star

bright lights

white lights

where the neons glow

my bag is packed,

I've got my act

so all aboard,

C'mon, let's go



Farmboys

Let's go



[train whistle blowing]



June

Wait!

Stop the train.

Stop the music.

Stop everything!

I can't go to Broadway

With you.



Farboy

Why not, dainty June?



June

Because...

I'm staying here

With Caroline, my favorite cow!



Farmboys

Yay!

Yay!



[playing the stars

And stripes forever]
