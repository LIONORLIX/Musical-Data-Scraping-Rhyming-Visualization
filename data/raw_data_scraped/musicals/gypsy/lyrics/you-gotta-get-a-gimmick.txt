You Gotta Get A Gimmick


MAZEPPA:

You can pull all the stops out

Till they call the cops out;

Grind your behind till you're banned.

But you gotta get a gimmick

If you wanna get a hand.

You can sacrifice your saccro

Working in the back row.

Bump in a dump till you're dead.

Kid, you gotta have a gimmick

If you wanna get ahead.



You can uh...You can uh...

You can uh...uh...uh...

That's how Burlesque was born.

So I uh...and I uh...

And I uh...uh...uh...

But I do it with a horn...

Once I was a Schleppa,

Now I'm Miss Mazzeppa,

With my revolution in dance.

You gotta have a gimmick

If you wanna have a chance!



ELECTRA:

She can uh... She can uh...

She can uh...uh...uh...

That'll never make her rich.

Me, I uh... and I uh...

And I uh...uh...uh...

But I do it with a switch.

I'm electrifyin',

And I ain't even tryin';

I never have to sweat to get paid;

'Cause if you got a gimmick,

Gypsy girl, you got it made.



TESSIE TURA:

All them uh and then uh...

And that uh...uh...uh...

Ain't gonna spell success;

Me, I uh... and I uh...

And I uh...uh...uh...

But I do it with finesse.

Dressy Tessie Tura is so much more demur-er

Than all them other ladies because--

You gotta get a gimmick

If you wanna get applause.



ALL:

Do something special

Anything special

And you'll get better because...

You're more than just a mimic

When you gotta gimmick

Take a look how different we are!



ELECTRA:

If you wanna make it,

Twinkle while you shake it.



TESSIE TURA:

If you wanna grind it,

Wait till you've refined it.



MAZEPPA:

If you wanna bump it,

Bump it with a trumpet!



ALL:

So get yourself a gimmick and you, too,

Can be a star!
