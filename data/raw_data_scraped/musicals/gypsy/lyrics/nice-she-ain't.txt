Nice She Ain't


[Herbie]

Her manner's charming.

But nice she ain't.

Her smiles disarming.

But nice she ain't.



She's a dame with more love

to give then she pretends.

And a heart that is to warm

to be refused.

every place that she goes

she makes a million friends.

that lady has friends

that she ain't even use.



Well I'm no bargain.

And she's no saint.

But oh so nice she ain't.

But nice she ain't.



But nice she ain't.



She's a dame with more love

to give then she pretends.

And a heart that is to warm

to be refused.

Every place that she goes

She makes a million friends.

That lady has friends

That she ain't even use.

Well I'm no bargain.

And she's no saint.

If nice she aint.

I've no complaint.

Cause mine oh mine she is.
