My Husband Makes Movies


[REPORTERS]

Not sincr Charlie Chaplin

Has there ever been a film Director

Like this



[FIRST REPORTER]

Mrs. Comtini, is there any truth to the rumor

that your marriage is in jeopardy?



[LUISA]

None whatsoever.



My husband makes movies.

To make them he lives a kind of dream

In which his actions aren't always

What they seem.

He may be on to some unique romantic

Theme.

Some men catch fish, some men tie

Flies,

Some earn their living baking bread.

My husband, he goes a little crazy

Making movies instead.



My husband spins fantasies,

He lives them, then gives them to you

All.

When he was working on the film on

Ancient Rome,

He made the slave girls take the

Gladiators home.

Some men buy stocks, some men punch

Clocks,

Some leap where others dare to tread.

My husband as author and director,

Makes up stories in his head.



Guido Contini, Luisa Contini,

Number one genius and number one fan,

Guido Contini, Luisa Contini,

Daughter of well-to-do Florentine

Clan,

Long ago, twenty years ago,

Once the names were Guido Contini,

Luisa Del Forno,

Actress with dreams and a life of her

Own,

Passionate, wild and in love on Livorno,

Singing with Guido all night on the

Phone.

Long ago, someone else ago, how he

Needs me so,

And he'll be the last to know it.



My husband makes movies.

To make them, he makes himself

Obsessed.

He goes for weeks on end without a

Bit of rest,

No other way can he achiev his level

Best.



Some men read books, some shine their

shoes,

Some retire early when they've seen

The evening news.

My husband only rarely comes to bed,

My husband makes movies instead,

My husband...makes movies...



[FIRST REPORTER]

Thank you very much, Mrs. Contini.
