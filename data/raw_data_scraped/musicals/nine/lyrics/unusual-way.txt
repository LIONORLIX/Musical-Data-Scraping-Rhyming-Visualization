Unusual Way


Claudia (seeing he?s lost in himself) In a very unusual

way, one time I needed you.

In a very unusual way, you were my friend.

Maybe it lasted a day,

Maybe it lasted an hour,

But somehow it will never end.

In a very unusual way, i think I?m in love with you.

In a very unusual way, i want to cry.

Something inside me goes weak, something inside me

surrenders,

And you?re the reason why,

You?re the reason why.

You don?t know what you do to me.

You don?t have a clue.

You can?t tell what it?s like to be me looking at

you.

It scares me so that i can hardly speak.

In a very unusual way, i owe what i am to you.

Though at times it appears i won?t stay,

I never go.

Special to me in my life,

Since the first day that i met you.

How could i ever forget you,

Once you had touched my soul?

In a very unusual way, you?ve made me whole.

Our Lady of the Spa With the arrival of film star Claudia

Nardi, there was no question but that he suddenly

seemed stronger.

La FleurContini! The crew arrives tomorrow!

Guido I am ready!

Our Lady of the Spa For his cast, he hired everyone at the

spa. But I mistrusted his apparent strength. Victories

of the kind he needed aren?t won so easily.

Guido Luisa, my angel, light of my life, I am about to

enter a realm I have never dared enter before. Wish me

luck! (to himself) Casanova! What an idea!

Guido Oh ... Claudia In a very unusual

way

What you have done I owe what i am

For me. to you



Though at times

it appears i won?t

As always before, stay,

Special to me I never go.

Since that First

day. Special to me in my

life,

Since the first day

that i met you.

Guido & Claudia How could i ever forget you,

Once you had touched my soul?

In a very unusual way, you?ve made me whole.



Guido calls in a silk curtain that masks the stage.
