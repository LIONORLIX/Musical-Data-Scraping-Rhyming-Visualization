Folies Bergeres


Le cinema today is in a crisis.

Directors are so existentialistes.

The movies are not worth their entrance prices

If no one sings a love song when he?s kissed.

Contini! I want a musical!

Love cannot be love without ?le singing?,

A string, a clarinet, a saxophone.

Take a lesson from this old Parisian

And the finest entertainment she/he has known.

Folies Berg?res

What a showing of color, costume, and dancing!

Not a moment in life could be more entrancing

Than an evening you spend aux Folies Berg?res.

Folies Berg?res,

Not a soul in the world could be in despair when he

is glancing

At the fabulous stage des Folies Berg?res.

Think of the footlights bright and gleaming,

Le strip-tease, le can-can we all adore.

Life is too short without dreaming,

And dreams are what le cinema is for.

Folies Berg?res

La musique et la danse, le son, la lumi?re!

Les petits jolis seins des belles bouqueti?res

Sur la belle passerelle des Folies Berg?res.

Pas de myst?re

Le spectacle est tout a fait d?couvert.



(NOTE. What follows is a section of Liliane La Fleur?s

passerelle monologue from the original Broadway production

of Nine. It is provided solely to demonstrate how one La

Fleur was able to recreate for Guido the intimacy, charm,

and warmth of the Folies Bergeres. The passerelle routine

is improvisatory and must be tailored to the talents of the

performer playing La Fleur. It is optional and can easily

be excised from the number.)

(La Fleur goes to Guido and whispers in his ear. He nods

and announces.)



Guido Mesdames et messieurs! Et maintenant-la vedette des

Folies Berg?res: Liliane La Fleur!

La Fleur (crossing onto the passerelle and speaking to

the audience) Bon soir. Je suis la vedette des Folies

Berg?res a Paris, et ?a, c?est la passerelle de mon

souvenir. Passerelle ... it?s a runway ... did you know

that? Anyway, I have to tell you, I have received

before the show a HUGE bouquet of roses, and the person

who sent it to me is here tonight. And I would like to

thank him. Who is it? (to some man in the audience)

Hello, there. Did you do it? Did you send me the

flowers? ... Why not? I have to find out who did it.

(to another man) Did you send me the flowers? Don?t ask

her, I?m talking to you. . . . You did? Oh that?s

great! What is your name? ... Jerry? You?re a liar.

That?s not the name on the card. (Little Guido has ap

peared before her, holding a small gift box behind

him.) What are you doing here? This is the stage of the

Folies Berg?res. You?re too young to be here. You?re

too young or you?re too short. Does this child belong

to anyone? Please? Because I don?t know what to do with

you, I really-You don?t understand a word I?m saying,

do you? You?re not an American? (He shakes his head.)

Oh, I see ... Are you French? (He shakes his head.)

Well, nobody?s perfect. Are you Italian? (He nods.) I

knew it! Moi aussi: la moitie fran?aise, la- (He turns,

revealing the gift box.) I don?t believe this. He

brought me a gift. Did you bring this all the way from

Italy? Is this cheese? Formaggio? Merci, cheri. Now you

go home, my sweetheart. (He starts off.) Wait a minute!

Bambino! Vieni a chi - a qui - or whatever. (He

returns.) In the other hand, you can wait for me in my

dressing room. I will see you after the show. (He runs

off.) Well he?s Italian, isn?t he?



Necrophorus steps forward.)



Necrophorus The trouble with Contini, he?s the king of

mediocrities,

A second-rate director who believes that he is

Socrates.

He never makes a ?movie? or a ?picture? or a ?flick?

He makes a ?film?-get it? -a ?film?.

A typical Italian with his auto and biography,

A mixture of Catholicism, pasta, and pornography,

A superficial, womanizing, moderately charming Latin

fraud.

Guido Grazie!

Necrophorus Prego!

And what are his movies about?

Just beauty, truth, death, youth, love, life,

anguish, angst.

Thanks to him we have boredom at the movies.

Guido Grazie!

Necrophorus Prego!

La Fleur (reclaiming spotlight) Darlings!

(NOTE. The following instrument music may be used to

accompany a boa dance, as in the original Broadway pro

duction; a dance for La Fleur and COMPANY sans boa; or may

be cut entirely. What follows is the Broadway version.)

(La Fleur opens the gift box and pulls out one end of a

feather boa that she eventually trails over forty-six feet

of passerelle. )



La Fleur I love it! (the dances with the boa, rapping

herself in it. A waltz, then all join in a can-can.)

All Follies Berg?res

The music, the lights, and the laughter,

The answer to what you are after

Each night at the Follies Berg?res.

Follies Berg?res -

La Fleur (to Guido) To your modern ideas I simply

compare one derriere

All At the Follies Berg?res!

The answer to what you are after,

The music, the lights, and the laughter

Of the Follies Berg?res!

La Fleur So! There you are! This is what I want!

Guido You?re joking.

La Fleur No, I?m not joking! When you signed the

contract, you signed to do a musical! I want le

singing! I want le dansing! I want a musical! Do it!

SCENE: IN THE CATACOMBS OF THE SPA



Our Lady of the Spa Signor Contini, His Eminence has

granted your request for an interview ... It?s the

oldest part of the spa. Rumor has it that several

saints are buried in these catacombs. It offers the

Cardinal the kind of privacy he needs when he comes for

the baths ... Don?t stay too long; he isn?t well. Your

Eminence, Signor Contini is here. (Guido reads both his

own lines and the Cardinal?s. )

Guido I am very grateful for you granting me this visit.

Cardinal What can I do for you, my son?

Guido Do you believe in God?

Cardinal (taken aback) Excuse me, are you a Catholic?

Guido Oh yes. Very much so. Not as much as I would like to

be, or as much as you would like me to be, I?m sure.

But I?m certainly trying.

Cardinal Try harder.

Guido Well, I don?t know how! Father, look, I?m confused.

I?ve reached a point in my life where I don?t know

which way to turn anymore. And it?s affecting me in

peculiar ways. (A church bell rings.) Father, I have

been seeing things of late-people, visions. Sometimes

they remind me of my early days in school, and I think

that what I?m seeing must be the work of the Devil. (A

Nun and Four Boys pass in the background.)

Cardinal My son. If you can believe in a world in

which you can see the Devil, surely you must also

believe in a world in which you can see an angel. (The

Nun and Boys exit. Guido?s Mother rises.)

Guido Mama ...
