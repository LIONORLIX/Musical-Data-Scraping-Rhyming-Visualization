Eins, zwei, drei,

Vier, funf, sechs,

The Germans at the spa, the Germans at

The spa,

They'll soon be arriving here to spend

A lost weekend in Shangri-La.

The Germans at the spa descend from

German mounts.

They've come to take the waters with

The daughters of Italian counts.



How we love to have the Germans at

The spa.

Carefully avoiding and slight faux pas.

For the Germans at the spa, For the Germans

At the spa,

For the Germans alles must be perfect.



The Germans are coming, The Germans

Are coming,

Roll out the wienerscnitz, roll out

The wienerscnitz.

They'll soon be arriving, the spa will

Be thriving.

They'll come, they'll sit, they'll

Schvitz.

They'll come, they'll sit, they'll

Schvitz.



Be sure there's lots of German music

Playing.



Und was du tust in meinem brust,

O mein geliebter, o meine herz, alle

Geliebter, und so weiter.



[MAMA MADDELENA]

Go mow the lawns.



[CHAMBERMAIDS]

I'll mow the

Lawns.



[MAMA MADDELENA]

Go cool the beer.



[CHAMBERMAIDS]

I'll cool the beer.



[MAMA MADDELENA]

Go shell the

Prawns.



[CHAMBERMAIDS]

I'll shell the

Prawns.



[MAMA MADDELENA]

I think they're

Here.



[CHAMBERMAIDS]

They're here.



[GERMANS]

Ve're here, ve're here,

The Germans at the spa, the Germans at

The spa.

We just got in a minute ago, 'cause

Germany is filled with snow.

Together now hurrah for the Germans

At the spa.



[MAMA MADDELENA]

Of anything the could have chosen,

Why do they wear lederhosen?



[GERMANS]

How ve love to spielen at our favorite

Spa,

Carefully avoiding all the French

Bourgeois,

For the Germans at the spa, for the

Germans at the spa,

For the Germans alles must be German.



The Germans are laughing, ve're all

Photographing,

Ve click the hasselblad, ve click the

Hasselblad,

Und jetzt ve're unpacking. If nothing is

Lacking, Ve take a  promenade, ve take a

Promenade.



And vot's that lovely music I hear

Playing?

Und was do tust in meinem brust,

O mein geliebter, o meine herz, alle

Geliebter, und so weiter



[GERMAN 1]

Just vunce a year I can romance

Beneath the dance of an Italian

Apricot moon,



[GERMAN 2]

Und vunce a year I can be more than

Just another tycoon.

Too soon this all shall pass.



[ITALIANS]

The Germans at the spa

Are eating halevah

And closing a deal for oil with

A noted Middle Easter shah.



[GERMANS]

Ve excercise by day,

At night romantic play,

I'm dancing with Isolde. When I

Hold 'er evrything's o.k.



[ITALIANS]

How we love to see the Germans at the

Spa.



[GERMANS]

How ve love to be the Germans at the

Spa.



[ALL]

For the Germans at the spa, for the

Germans at the spa,

For the Germans Italy is heaven.



[GERMANS]

(The Germans are coming etc.) Just vunce

A year

We have the chance to find romance

Beneath the dance

Of an Italian apricot moon.

Und vunce a year ve can be absolutely

Free

As if ve're floating like a helium

Balloon.



[ITALIANS]

Be sure there's lots of German music

Playing,

How we love to have the Germans at

The Spa!
