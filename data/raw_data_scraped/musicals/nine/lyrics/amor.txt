Amor


Guido-Casanova I, Casanova, have come to Venice (indicating

Claudia)

With my dear wife, Beatrice, mi amore,

Here to take a rest, enjoy the waters and the food,

And be with her, the apple of my cuore.

Mama Maddelena (as ?Carla?-Maria) Casanova!

Guido-Casanova Maria! What are you doing here?

Maddelena-Maria I?m staying at the Hosteleria Caldissima,

Numero venti venti:

Drop by tonight at ten o?clock,

I?ll give you plenty.

Guido-Casanova I can?t believe how my good fortune still

does serve me.

So much romance at hand, i really don?t deserve me.

Guido & Boudoir Ladies Amor, i love them all, every beauty,

Short or tall, there?s a duty

To make love to each and all.

Amor, it?s my profound obligation

To go round every nation

And make love to one and all.

Yes, i have lived and breathed and slept amor.

I freely give and do accept amor.

Big amor, small amor, all my life has been amor.

I?ve always known what i am living for amor

Guido-Casanova But alas, i am distressed by all this beauty

fine

If i must choose but one concubine.



Ladies scream ?Me! Me!?



Guido Get ready for the? next set-up!



All leave to change for next scene. Necrophorus steps

forward.



Necrophorus Contini can?t seriously believe we will accept

This fatuous rendering of a seventeenth century

opera

As an excuse for a movie.

No way, no way, no way!

Guido?s Mother (entering) If only Guido had become a

priest or a lawyer,

But no, he makes these films i can?t explain to my

friends.



Necrophorus and Guido?s Mother step aside, away from the

action.



Guido (running into place for scene with Claudia,

Maddelena, and La Fleur) Places, places! (Boudoir Nuns

enter. Guido ?shoots himself? as if with a gun,

collapses.)

Claudia-Beatrice Casanova, you must relax.

You will exhaust yourself and soon become too

stanco.

Look, i have prepared a picnic basket, prosciutto,

olives,

And of course your favorite, vino-bianco.



Luisa stares in horror.
