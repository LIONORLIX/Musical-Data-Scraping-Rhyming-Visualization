A Man Like You


Claudia A man like you

One woman?s not enough for you, Guido

Guido One?s plenty if she?s you, Claudia

Claudia Not true,

You need two, Guido, my charming Casanova.

Guido Casanova? ... Me?

Claudia Maybe even three, Guido

Guido (speaks) Casanova? ... That?s it! What an idea!

(sings)

Me ... Casanova!



He sits and ponders the idea she has just given him.
