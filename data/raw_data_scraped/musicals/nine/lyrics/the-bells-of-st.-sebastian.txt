The Bells of St. Sebastian


Guido I remember St. Sebastian with a memory most unkind.

I can hear the bells I heard when I went there

Inside the church, inside my mind.

The bells of St. Sebastian only ring once in your

ears,

But if you?re very young when you hear them,

Their sound can last a hundred years.

All But the music of the ringing

Was the music of our singing

When we were singing Kyrie Eleison,

Kyrie Eleison, Kyrie Eleison.

Guido (echoed by All) Each day at lauds, (Each day at

lauds)

Each night at vespers, (Each night at vespers)

From every tower the hour would be tolled

For those of us at St. Sebastian,

No longer young and not yet old.

Guido?s Mother But why did you go to this woman?

Little Guido To see what she was like!

Guido Each day at St. Sebastian in the classroom we would

hear

That devils lurked behind every corner.

If you tried to look, they would disappear.

The nuns of St. Sebastian tried to teach the facts

of life,

Explaining there are two kinds of women

One was a whore, one was a wife.

All But the music of the ringing

Was a different world that opened through our

singing

When we were singing Kyrie Eleison,

Kyrie Eleison, Kyrie Eleison.

Guido (echoed by All) They rang at dawn (They rang at

dawn)

They rang at midnight (They rang at midnight)

In tones well-rounded they sounded down the nave

For all the souls of little boys at St. Sebastian

Too young to save.

All Kyrie Eleison, Eleison, Christe Eleison, Eleison.

Guido?s Mother You?ve brought such shame on us!

Little Guido But Mama, I didn?t know!

All For lunch at St. Sebastian, country cheese and

buttered bread,

Guido A prayer we never learned sung in latin,

Then a midday nap in a makeshift bed,

All Then the music of the ringing,

Then the music of our singing,

And we were singing Kyrie Eleison,

Kyrie Eleison, Kyrie Eleison.

Guido (echoed by All) We should have known. (We should

have known)

They should have warned us. (They should have warned

us)

At St. Sebastian they never spared the rod,

(At St. Sebastian they never spared the rod)

Guido But in the music of the bells at St. Sebastian

We looked for God.

Little Guido Kyrie Eleison...



As the Music continues, Little Guido steals away and starts

running.



Guido?s Mother Guido, where are you running to?



Little Guido has run back to wave at Sarraghina. She

returns his wave as the curtain falls to end Act One.
