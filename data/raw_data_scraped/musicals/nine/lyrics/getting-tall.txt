Getting Tall


Little Guido (sings) Guido... Guido... (Guido rises,

looks disgustedly at the ineffective pistol.)

Scraping knees, tying shoes,

Starting school, paying dues,

Finding there?s no way

We can spend a lifetime playing ball

Part of getting tall.



Little Guido approaches the forlorn figure of Guido.



Learning more, knowing less,

Simple words, tenderness part of getting tall.



He sits with Guido



Guido, you?re not crazy, you?re all right.

Everyone wants everyone in sight ...

But knowing you have no one if you try to have them

all

Is part of tying shoes,

Part of starting school,

Part of scraping knees if we should fall

Part of getting tall.



Little Guido pushes Guido to his feet, gives Guido his

baton. Guido looks to the front, as the people in his mind

-the Germans, the Italians, Our Lady of the Spa,

Necrophorus, La Fleur, Guido?s Mother, Claudia, Carla, the

Nun- enter in turn. When they are assembled in their

original places, he prepares to ?conduct his orchestra??

but sees one empty place... Luisa?s.
