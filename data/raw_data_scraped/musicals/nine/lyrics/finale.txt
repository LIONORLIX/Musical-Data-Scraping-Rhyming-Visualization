Exit All except Guido, Our Lady of the Spa; Luisa, and

Carla.



Our Lady of the Spa As far as I could see, his creative

life had become, by now, so closely bound to his

personal that once his personal life began to fall

apart, his creative had to fall apart as well; there

was just no separation anymore.

Guido Luisa?

Our Lady of the Spa La sua signora non e qui.

Guido Claudia?

Our Lady of the Spa La Signorina Nardi non e qui.

Guido Carla?

Our Lady of the Spa She?s at the station. (She exits.)

Guido Carla, listen, there?s been a misunderstanding here!

Carla I agree.

Guido No-no, listen, that isn?t what I mean! Look, I love

you very much! Why complicate this love? What?s between

you and me is so simple!

Carla Sure, Guido. Simple.
