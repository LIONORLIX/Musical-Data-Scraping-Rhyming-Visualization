Every Girl in Venice


Our Lady of the Spa Every girl in Venice is in love with

Casanova.

Every girl has kissed him once or twice.

Every girl in Venice is in love with Casanova.

As long as Casanova pays her price.

Every girl in Venice is expecting Casanova.

Every girl is combing out her hair.



Other Spa Ladies begin joining her, as they enter in their

boudoir costumes.



Counting every minute till they see their Casanova

And staring out their windows everywhere.

Every girl in Venice wants to hear from Casanova:

She will be the only girl for him.

Every girl is grinning ear to ear for Casanova

And waiting to attend his every whim...



Little Boys enter as pages, flanking La Fleur, dressed in

Claudia?s abandoned costume, mama Maddelena, and Claudia.

Guido enters.
