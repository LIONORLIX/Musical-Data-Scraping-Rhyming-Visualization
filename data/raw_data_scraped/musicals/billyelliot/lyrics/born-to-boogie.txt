Born to Boogie


We weren't born to stand still

Ain't a question of will

Gotta move it's a fact

You were born to react

You weren't made to behave

Like you will in the grave.



Where mu-sic is played

Oh the soul - will be swayed

And your feet they will move

As if on - ly to prove

That it was ?n't by chance

We were des - tined to dance.



We were born to boogie,

We were born to boogie

It ain't a puzzle,

Cos we're blood and muscle

From the day of creation

We were the dance sensation.

Come on and shake per bootie

Cos we were born to boogie

Anyone can get it

Cos we're born kinetic

Come on and Mash Potat-a

The way God made pa.



Your feet and your hands

Oh your toes and your glands

Your eyes and your chin

Your face and your skin

Oh your brawn and your brains

Your balls and your chains



We were born to boogie,

We were born to boogie

It ain't a puzzle,

Coo we're blood and muscle

From the day of creation

We were the dance sensation.



BRAITHWAITE

Come on and shake yer bonnie

we were born to boogie

Anyone can get it

We were born kinetic



Come on and ?Mash Potat-a?

The way God made ya.



We were born to boogie

We're all born to



We came up from the ocean

In full locomotion

And when we hit the ground

We just danced around

Because they say

It's in the DNA



We were born to boogie

We were born to boogie

We were born to boogie

WE'RE-ALL-BORN-TO-BOOGIE!
