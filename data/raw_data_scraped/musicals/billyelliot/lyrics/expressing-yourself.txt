Expressing Yourself


Is it sinful if you're blue

To cheer up the place?

What is wrong with dressing up in satin and lace?

Get some earrings, some mascara, heels and a fan.

Pretty soon you will start to feel a different man.



What the hells wrung with expressing yourself?

Being who you want to be?

Will anybody die if you put on a dress?

Who the hell cares if your blushers a mess?



Start a new fashion, buck all the trends.

Emphasise in-teg-rit-eeeee.



Cos what the hell is wrong with expressing yourself

For wanting to be me?



BILLY

What the hell is wrong with wearing a dress?

Being who you wanna be?



MICHAEL

Who the hell is it you try to impress

All you have to do is learn to care less

Start a new fashion, buck all the trends



MICHAEL

Billy, sing something to me



What the hell is wrong with expressing yourself?

For trying to be free.



If you manna be a dancer, dance

If you manna be a miner, mine

If you want to dress like somebody else,

Fine, fine, fine.



It's not a big statement, it's not a weird act

Just a good idea at the time

We'll not complain about your boring life

If you'll just leave mete mine.

If you wanna be a dancer, dance

If you wanna be a miner, mine



Everyone is different

It's the natural state

It's the facts, it's plain to see,

The world's grey enough without making it worse

What we need is in-div-id-ual-ity.
