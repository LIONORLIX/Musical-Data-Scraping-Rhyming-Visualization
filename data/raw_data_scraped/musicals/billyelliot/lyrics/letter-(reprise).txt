Teacher: *spoken, reading from the letter* Dear Billy,

I must seem a distant memory



Billy: *spoken, from memory* Which is...



Teacher: *spoken* Which is probably a good thing

And it will have been a long...



Billy: *spoken* A long time



Billy: *sung* And I will have missed you growing

And I'll have missed you crying

And I'll have missed you laugh

Missed your stamping and your shouting

I have missed telling you off

But please, Billy, know that I was always there

I was with you through everything

And please, Billy,



Teacher: *sung* But please Billy. Know that I will always be

Proud to have known you

Proud that you were mine

Proud in everything



Teacher and Billy's mother: *sung* And you must promise me this, Billy

In everthing you do

Always be yourself,



Teacher: *sung* Billy



Billy's mother: *sung* And you always will be true

And I will have missed you growing

I'll have missed you crying

And I'll have missed you laugh

Missed your stamping and your shouting

I have missed telling you off

But please, Billy, know that I was always there

I was with you through everything

And please, Billy,

Know that I will always be

Proud to have known you

Love you forever



Billy: *spoken*Love you forever



Teacher: *spoken* Mam
