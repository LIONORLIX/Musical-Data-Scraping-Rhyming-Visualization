Deep Into The Ground


Oh once I was a young man

Looked over vales and hills

Saw myself a future

of riches and of thrills

But on me fifteenth birthday

I paid my union dues

And they sent me deep into the ground



Oh the winter wind can blow me colder

Oh the summer's heat can parch me dry

But I'll not leave here for a fortune

I shall never leave here till I die



Oh once I had a family

Sons to make you proud

They have gone and left me now,

And I count the time out loud

For now I am an old man

Just waiting for my turn

Till they take me back into the ground



Oh the winter wind can blow me colder

Oh the summer's heat can parch me dry

But I'll not leave here for a fortune

I shall never leave here till I die



Oh the winter wind can blow me colder

Oh the summer's heat can parch me dry

But I'll love these dark, dark hills forever

And I won't leave them until I die



Oh once I loved a woman

She meant all she world to me

Saw ourselves a future

As far as I could see

But I was only forty-seven

when they took her down from me

And buried her deep



Oh the winter wind can blow me colder

Oh the summer's heat can parch me dry

But I'll love these dark, dark hills forever

And I won't leave them now until I die
