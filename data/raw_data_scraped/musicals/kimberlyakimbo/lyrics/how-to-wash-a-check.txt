How to Wash a Check


[Intro: Debra, Seth, Martin]

Alright, listen, this mailbox is filled with checks

Which we're gonna retrieve and wipe clean

Isn't that check fraud?

I mean, what even is "check fraud?"

It's the fraudulent use of checks

Merriam-Webster over here

Okay, let's review

"How to Wash a Check"



[Verse 1]

Tie the fish-line

Open the mailbox

Drop the glue trap

Get a bite

Pull the line up

Take the check out

Make a copy

Do it right



[Refrain]

Or nobody gets what they want

Nobody gets what they want, sing it

Nobody gets what they want, in harmony

Nobody gets what they want



[Interlude]

Okay, next steps



[Verse 2]

Soak the checky

In the solvent

Where'd the ink go? (Ooh)

Outta sight

Dry the check off

Forge the Hancock

"To Seth Weetis" (Wait, what?)

Do it right (Did you say Seth Wee—)



[Refrain]

Or everybody ends up in jail (Oh God)

Everybody ends up in jail (Tell me)

Everybody ends up in jail (Remind me)

Everybody ends up in jail



[Interlude]

Good, now you do it



[Verse 3]

Tie the fish line (Right)

Open the mailbox (Good)

Now the glue trap (You didn't peel it)

Where's the fish line? (What are you doing?)

The line is tangled (Jesus)

These fumes are strong (What is happening?)

Who has the glue trap? (I can't peel it)

If you guys cock this up

[Refrain]

Nobody gets what they want

Nobody gets what they want

Nobody gets what they want



[Interlude]

Can't I just reach in the mailbox? My arms are pretty skinny

No, just do it like I said

Got the fish line, got the glue trap

Hand it over

It's so sticky



[Verse 4]

I think my arm's stuck (What?)

Inside the mailbox? (Oh shit, his arm's stuck)

Stuck in the mailbox (I said not to do that)

Stuck in the mailbox (I'm sorry)

Pull it out (I can't)

Try to relax (It's eating my arm)



[Refrain]

The glue trap is stuck to my head (How did you—)

The glue trap is stuck to my head

The glue trap is stuck to her head (Of course it is)

The mailbox is eating my arm (Kill me)

The mailbox is eating— The glue trap is stuck to—

Everybody's going to jail

Everybody's going to jail, sing it

Everybody's going to jail

[Interlude]

Ugh, you know what? You're terrible at this

Maybe I should've recruited the Show Choir from West Orange

No, we are better than West Orange

We can do this, you guys!

Tenor! Alto! Bass! Watch!



[Verse 5]

Tie the fish line

Open the mailbox

Drop the glue trap

Get a bite (Okay)

Pull the line up

Take the check out

Make a copy

Do it right (You're getting my hopes up)

Soak the checky, soak the checky

Soak the checky (Aloha)

In the solvent, in the solvent

In the solvent (Mahalo)

Where'd the ink go? Where'd the ink go?

Where'd the ink go? (I'm gonna learn to hula on Waikiki Beach)

Outta sight, outta sight, outta sight

Dry the check off, dry the check off, dry the check off

Forge the Hancock, forge the Hancock, forge the Hancock

"To Seth Weetis," "To Seth Weetis," "To Seth Weetis"

We did it right (I knew you would)

Yay!



[Outro]

Then you get the costumes you need (Oh, woah)

We get the costumes we need

Yeah, and Kim gets a family trip (Oh, woah)

Kim gets a family trip

And I get to Waikiki Beach (Oh, woah)

And you get to Waikiki Beach

And Seth gets

Oh, I don't really need anyth— (Doesn't matter)

Everybody gets what they want, yeah

Everybody gets what they want, yeah

Everybody gets what they want
