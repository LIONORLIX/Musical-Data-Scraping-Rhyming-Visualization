This Time


[BUDDY]

Do you remember what you said?

How you hated me and wished I was dead

That you hoped I'd drive off the road

Then I'd hit a tree, and my car would explode

Well, I thought to myself

That can't be good for a daughter to say

And I thought to myself

I should do this another way



[KIMBERLY]

Maybe this time

Maybe this time

After all the lies

After all the beer

Maybe he can change

Maybe he's sincere

Maybe

This time



[PATTIE]

Do you remember what you said?

How I reminded you of that story you r?ad

And at first, I felt kind of thrilled

'Til you explain?d who Medea had killed

Well, I thought to myself

That can't be good for a daughter to say

And I thought to myself

I should do this another way



[KIMBERLY]

Maybe this time

Maybe this time

After all the hurt

Maybe there's a twist

Maybe she won't be a narcissist

I want to believe them

I want to believe

This time

I will believe



This time

Oh, this time

Oh, this time

I put aside the doubt

This time

Oh, this time

Oh, this time

Maybe things work out



[DEBRA]

This time

Oh, this time

This time

The dead ends will end

[SETH & (DEBRA)]

This time (This time)

Oh, this time (This time)

Oh



[BOTH]

This time



[SETH]

I think I found a friend



[SHOWCHOIR]

It's Friday night in Bergen County

There are parties everywhere

And we finally got invited!



[ALL]

This time

(Oh) this time

(Oh) this time

A better life begins



It's Friday night in Bergen County (This time)

There are parties everywhere (This time)

This time

Everybody wins

This time

We won't implode

This time

[KIMBERLY]

We hit the road



[ALL]

This time



[BUDDY & PATTIE]

We'll stay on track



[ALL]

This time



[SETH]

My voice won't crack



[ALL]

This time



[SHOWCHOIR]

We take the prize



[ALL]

This time



[DEBRA]

Nobody dies!

Not like the other time



[ALL]

This time

Oh, this time

Oh, this time

No one breaks your heart

This time (This time)

Oh, this time (This time, this time)

Oh

This time



[KIMBERLY]

Nothing falls apart



[BUDDY (spoken)]

Make a wish!



[KIMBERLY]

I will believe



[ALL]

This time
