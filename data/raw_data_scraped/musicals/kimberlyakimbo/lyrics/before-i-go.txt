Before I Go


[KIM]

I was never the daughter you wanted

That's the thing we never say

But that’s the truth and that's okay

We live in a house that's haunted

There’s always you, there's always me

And there's the ghost of a girl I'll never be



There's the ghost of a girl I'll never be

Before I go, let go of the ghost

Just let her disappear

And then maybe you'll see me

While I'm still here

I’m still here



I was never the girl you intended

She was young and she was bold

She’d hold your hand when you got old

Let's admit, the dream has ended

And what you wished for wasn’t me

It was the ghost of a girl I'll never be



She's the ghost of a girl I'll never be

Before I go, let’s give up the ghost

Just he with me instead

I know I might be dying

But I'm not dead

I'm not dead



So before I go, take my hand

Before I fly away, say goodbye

I will go somewhere that's beautiful

I'll go somewhere that's beautiful

It's time let me go



[PATTI]

Father Time



[KIM]

Let me go



[PATTI]

Slow down the day



[KIM]

Let me fly away



[PATTI & (BUDDY)]

Don't let the dark come in (You have your whole live)

Steal it away



[KIM]

It's time



[PATTI & (BUDDY)]

For goodness sake (Your whole life)

You're still awake

[BUDDY]

See the world

See the world

See the world



[PATTI]

And baby wants to play

And baby wants to play



[KIM]

Oh

Dear Make a Wish Foundation of New Jersey

As you probably know by now

My name is Kimberly Levaco

Thank you for the treehouse

But I don't need a treehouse

I'm gonna bungee jump

I'm gonna jet ski

I'm gonna hang glide and clog dance

And swim at the bottom of a waterfall

In New Zealand



I'll see the world

See the world

See the world
