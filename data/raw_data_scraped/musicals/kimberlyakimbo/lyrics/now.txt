Now


[SETH]

You think I don't know that people go away?

I know they do, okay

I know they do



Today I brought card games

And books filled with puzzles

And bags full of unhealthy snacks

Today I brought music

By gloomy young women

And marked all the weepiest tracks



Or we can just sit here

And watch a dumb movie

I'll do whatever you say

I'll sit here beside you

And talk 'til we're tired

Then, we can call it a day



And tomorrow we'll do the same, or not

But tomorrow will come anyhow, or not

And if not

Well, there's now

And if not

Well



[KIM]

You say to be present

And live in the moment

But right now I'm stuck in a bed

I'd rath?r be living

A way better mom?nt

Can't we find that one instead?



And tomorrow we'll do the same, or not

But tomorrow will come anyhow, or not

And if not



Maybe it's time to throw caution to the wind



[SETH]

Maybe it's time to throw caution to the wind



[KIM]

And do something we may regret



[SETH]

And do something we may regret



[KIM]

At least we'll be happy

[SETH]

At least we'll be living



[KIM]

At least in that moment



[SETH]

We'll have a moment



[BOTH]

We'll never forget



[SETH & (KIM)]

And tomorrow we'll do the same or not (And tomorrow we'll do the same)

But tomorrow will come anyhow or not (But tomorrow will come)



[BOTH]

And if not

Well

There's now, now, now, now, now

There's now, now, now, now, now

There's now
