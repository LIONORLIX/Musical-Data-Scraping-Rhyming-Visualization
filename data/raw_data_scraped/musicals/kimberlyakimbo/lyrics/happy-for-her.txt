Happy for Her


[BUDDY]

I should be happy she found a friend

Someone to talk to, someone to study with

Someone to share a joke, someone to buddy with



(spoken)

Heh, 'buddy with'..



(singing)

I should be happy for her

Happy, happy

Happy for her

I should be happy



[SETH, spoken]

And "a gentleman" can be rearranged to spell "elegant man!"



[BUDDY]

But does he have to be so weird

And does he have to talk so much

And do they have to sit so close

And do their kneecaps have to touch?

Why is he sitting in the front?

Why is his tuba in the back?

Jesus, Buddy, take a breath

He's just a harmless braniac



[SETH, spoken]

Hey, you guys wanna share my muffin?



[BUDDY, spoken]

Nope! No food in my car!



[KIM, spoken]

What are you doing?



[SETH, spoken]

That was my breakfast...



[BUDDY]

I should be happy she likes a boy

Someone who's friendly

Someone who's well-behaved

Someone who's not tattooed

Someone who's never shaved



I should be happy for her

Happy, happy

Happy for her

I should be happy



[KIM, spoken]

"A duck with hiccups!"

[SETH, spoken]

That's so good!



[BUDDY]

But I don't like the way this feels

And I don't want to see them flirt

And I don't want him near my Kim

'Cause I don't want her getting hurt

I think I need to shut this down

I think I've let it go too far

I need to nip this in the bud

I need to stop this speeding car



(spoken) E-nough!

My daughter is a precious flower, I won't allow her to be picked!



[KIM, spoken]

Oh, God!



[SETH, spoken]

What?



[BUDDY]

Now, I'm not trying to be mean

And I don't mean to be a jerk

But I remember how this goes

And I know how the hormones work

[SETH, spoken]

What did I do?



[KIM, spoken]

Please stop



[BUDDY]

I know I'm getting huffy

But he's all up in my face

'Cause you let him in my car

Which you know is sacred space!



[KIM, spoken]

Cut it out!



[BUDDY]

Maybe you're just mad

I understand, but that's enough

By the way, you didn't fool me

With that 'share a muffin' stuff



[SETH, spoken]

I-



[BUDDY]

I may not be the brightest

But I'm smarter than I look

And I know what boys are after

'Cause kid, I wrote the book



[SETH, spoken]

Wow!



[KIM, spoken]

Dad!



[BUDDY]

Your mom and I had urges

I'm not saying that they're wrong

But they come with repercussions

That's how babies come along



[SETH, spoken]

What?!



[KIM, spoken]

Babies?!



[BUDDY]

You're a horny little punk

Who thinks that maybe there's a chance

But I swear to God, Weetis

You're not getting in her pants!



[KIM & SETH, spoken]

Eww!



[BUDDY]

You're not getting in her pants

You're not getting in her pants

You're not getting in her pants

You're not getting in her pants

Her pants

Her pants, pants, pants, pants

Pants, pants

Pants!
