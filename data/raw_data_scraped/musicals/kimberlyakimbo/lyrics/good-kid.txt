Good Kid


[SETH]

My brother played with nunchucks

I liked playing chess

My brother broke the knick-knacks

I would clean the mess

I ate my peas and carrots

My brother never would

And as my mother died

I promised to be good



The good kid, the good boy, the good one

The bookworm, the Boy Scout, the good son

What has it gotten me, being good?

What has it gotten me?



My father smokes in silence

And paces in the yard

My brother goes to rehab

I study twice as hard



The good kid, th? good boy, the good one

The unseen, th? unheard, the good son

What has it gotten me, being good?



Maybe a little bad

Could do a lot of good

Consider Frodo Baggins

Consider Robin Hood

The good kid, the good boy, the good one

The wrong thing, the right choice, in the long run

What has it gotten me, being good?

What has it gotten me, being good?

Being good
