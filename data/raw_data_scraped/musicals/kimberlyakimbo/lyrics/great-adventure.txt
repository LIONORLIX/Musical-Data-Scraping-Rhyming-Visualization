Great Adventure


[KIM]

We're on a great adventure

Don't know what we're gonna find

When leaving what's behind behind

But you?are?by my side



[SETH]

At?last, a great adventure

Don't know where?the road will bend

Or when we're gonna reach the end



[KIM & SETH]

So just enjoy the ride

Because no one gets a second time around



[SETH]

Sadly



[KIM & SETH]

No one gets a second time around

We're sailing



[SHOWCHOIR]

We ar? sailing



[KIM & SETH]

To a distant shore



[SHOWCHOIR]

To a distant shore, ooh



[KIM]

Don't know if we'll catch a breez? or

Encounter stormy seas but



[KIM & SETH]

You will be my crew



[PATTI & BUDDY]

We're sailing



[SHOWCHOIR]

We are sailing



[PATTI & BUDDY]

To a new world



[SHOWCHOIR]

To a new world, oh



[DEBRA]

Don't know how the waves will flow

Or which-a-way the wind will blow

[PATTI, BUDDY & DEBRA]

So just enjoy the view

Because no one gets a second time around



[ALL]

Day is dying

We're headed for the setting sun

We're crying

Because we're almost done

Time's flying

It's been a lovely run

And so fun, so fun



On a great adventure

Didn't know the paths we'd take

The sights we'd see

The friends we'd make

With you, my partner-in-crime!

We'll miss this great adventure

You never know, and nor do I

When we will have to say goodbye

So just enjoy the time

Because no one gets a second time

No one gets a second time

No one gets a second time around

Doo doo doo doo doo doo

Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo

Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo

Doo doo doo-oo-oo

Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo

Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo

Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
