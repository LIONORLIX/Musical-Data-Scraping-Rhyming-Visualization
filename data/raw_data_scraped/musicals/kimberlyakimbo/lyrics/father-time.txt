Father Time


[PATTIE]

Father Time

Slow down the day

Don't let the dark come and

Steal it away

For goodness sake

We're still awake

And baby wants to play



Father Time

Hold back the night

Please let the sun stay and

We'll be alright

Tell?the?man?in the moon

It's?much too soon

To?be turning out the light



Baby's eyes are heavy now

Baby's breath is deep

Mommy wants to baby her

Baby wants to sleep



Father Time

Are you there?

Maybe tomorrow you'll have

Time to spare

And so I pray

For another day



Baby's ?yes are heavy now

Baby's br?ath is deep

Mommy wants to baby her

Baby wants to sleep



Father Time

Are you there?

Maybe tomorrow you'll have

Time to spare

And so I pray

For another day



Father, hear my prayer

Father, hear my prayer

Father, hear my prayer
