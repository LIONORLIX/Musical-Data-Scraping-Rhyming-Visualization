The Joy Of Motherhood


Ida: as a duck

Whenyou're stuck

Sat sitting in the middle of your nest

Then at best

You get bored...

There goes drake

On the lake

I can see him through the rushes

All the time

Feeling i'm

Just ignored

I don't pretend that this is all his doing

I'm a sucker for the billing

And the cooing

But when you hear that pitter patter

Of tiny feet it doesn't matter

How long i've had to sit here

Minding my brood

Those little heads so soft and downy

Their baby bods all golden downy

Their beaks constanly open

Waiting for food

It's the joy of motherhood

Those little ducklings

Walking round in a line

I'll do what any other mother would

To try to do my best at bringing up mine

It's the joy of motherhood

Those little perks

That make it all seem worthwhile

I'll do what any other mother would

To get my ducks decked out

And living in stlye

(maureen enters.  Dialogue until line "why do we put ourselves through it?)

Maureen: 'cos when you hear that dibble dabble

You're proud to say

"hey that's my rabble"

Then watch their maiden voyage

Out from the bank

Ida: like champagne corks

You'll see the bobbing

Maureen: accompanied by mothers sobbing

Both: relieved, thanks by to nature

Nobody sank

It's the joy...

Maureen: oh, prepare yourself, ida

(they are interrupted as the eggs begin to hatch)

Ida: it's the joy

Both: it's the joy

Ida: it's the joy

Maureen: joy

Ida: joy

Maureen: joy

Ida: joy

Both: it's the joy of motherhood

Those little perks

That make it all seem worthwhile

I'll do what any other mother would

Ida: to get my ducks decked out

And living in style

Maureen: to get those ducks decked out

And living

Ida: to get my ducks decked out

And living

Both: in style
