It Takes All Sorts


Queenie and Lowbutt: It takes all sorts to make a world

On that point we are clear

It takes all sorts to make a world

But we don?t want them here

Our taste is good and liberal

Our views are well expressed

It takes all sorts to make a world its just that our sort?s best



Queenie:

When one explores the great outdoors one fears what one may see



Lowbutt: We?re noble riche our perfect niche is here on the settee

Queenie:Out side the world keeps changing

It?s a constant state of flux

Lowbutt: That doesn?t suit domestic folk

It?s best left for you ducks



Queenie: Oh it takes all sorts to make a world

Lowbutt: Oh it takes all sorts (same time)

Both: On that point we are clear

Queenie: It takes all sorts to make a world

Lowbutt: It takes all sorts (same time)

Both: And we don?t want them here

Our taste is good and liberal

Our views are well expressed

It takes all sorts to make a world it?s just that our sort?s



Ugly: I think my sort?s



Queenie and Lowbutt: Our sort?s best
