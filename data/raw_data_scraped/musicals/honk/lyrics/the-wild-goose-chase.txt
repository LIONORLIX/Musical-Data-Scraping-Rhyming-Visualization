The Wild Goose Chase


Greylag

We're off on a wild goose chase

We will be no stranger to danger the squadron will show no fear



Dot

We're off and no matter where we roam

Although the mind boggles this gaggle in goggles

Is sure to find your home



Greylag

Runway's clear

Prepare for takeoff dear

We must

Play our

Part



Dot

Hark at him

I fear his cabin lights are rather dim



Greylag

Chocks away

Our air display

Must start



Greylag, dot

We're off on a wild goose chase

And our simple mission position the whereabouts of your farm

We're off and unless we're blown into kingdom come

We won't be back until we've found your mum



Dot (spoken)

But we don't even know where his farm is,

Dear, how are we going to plan the route?



Greylag (spoken)

Dont worry dear i'll navigate!



Dot (spoken)

Thats what i was afraid of



Greylag, dot, squadron

We're off on a wild goose chase

It's a thankless task but we ask

Who could do it as well as we

We're off, need to solve this problem's crux

For what could be grander

Than having a gander

For A-WOL missing ducks



Cat (spoken)

Hello ducky! I thought i lost you!



Greylag (spoken)

Stand back or i'll peck!



Cat (spoken)

Ooh, be still my quaking legs, i'm going to be goosed!





Ugly (spoken)

What are you doing here?



Cat (spoken)

Your mother sent me to fetch you- special envoy



Greylag (spoken)

Listen here, cat. I am in command around here,

And i have taken personal charge of the duckling's

Safe return to his mother



Cat (spoken)

Well i wouldn't try flying at the moment,

Haven't you heard the guns?



Greylag (spoken)

We will commence maneuvers as soon as the shooting party is over



Cat (spoken)

Well, maybe i could be of assistance. I'll go over to the shoot,

And let you know when the're packing up for the day



Greylag (spoken)

Very well, but no funny business,

I know several ways to skin your type



Cat (spoken)

It's like taking candy from a baby



Greylag, dot, squadron

We're off on a wild goose chase



Dot

You may think it odd

That a squad

Such as ours

Can perform this role



Greylag, dot, squadron

We're off,

And we'll prove that's not the case



Greylag

Avioding the ack-ack

We'll search for this quack-quack

And then return to base



Greylag (spoken)

We're about to face the most perilous mission to date.

I need hardly to tell you of the risks involved,

Or of the ultimate

Price we may have to pay. As we fly on to glory,

I want you to know how very proud i am of this squad.

Keep a stiff upper beak men, and remember out motto.

"siempre victorium non patte de foi gras"



Dot (spoken)

Good afternoon ladies and gentelmen, my name is dot,

And i am your senior flight attendant,

And on behalf of captain greylag,

I would like to welcome you to this afternoon's flight

From a boggy marshland to some...far flung farm. We will be

Cruising at an altitude of several feet

And flying in a rather attractive v-formation.

In the unlikely event of an emergency landing,

We ask that you observe the safety procedures we've been through so many,

Many times before.

We hope that you have a pleasant journey,

And thank you for choosing "goose air- the fluffy skies"



Greylag, dot, squadron

We're off to ensure this duckling is not so glum,

We won't be back until we've found your-



Cat (spoken)

The coast is clear- they're putting away their guns!



Greylag (spoken)

Are you sure?



Cat (spoken)

On one of my lives



Greylag (spoken)

Alright men, final check. Oh, and here's the cat's parachute



Cat (spoken)

F-f-for me?



Greylag(spoken)

You don't think i was going to leave you here with the duckling so you?

Oh no, puss, you're coming with us!



Cat (spoken)

Oh cat litter!!!



Greylag, dot, squadron

Our wings are spread



Ugly

So don't delay



Greylag, dot, squadron

Our excess bags are stowed away

It's time

To fly



Greylag, dot, squadron (simultaneous w/ ugly)

We're off on a wild goose chase

With a happy ending impending

If we can locate his nest



Ugly (simultaneous w/ greylag, dot, squadron)

They're off to try and find the farm

And when they find the farm they'll find my mum

And then she'll be there forever every day



Greylag, dot, squadron

We're off cheerio, goodbye, toodlepip old chum,

We won't be back until (we won't be back until [wont be back])

We won't be back until we've found (found [found])

Your mum!!
