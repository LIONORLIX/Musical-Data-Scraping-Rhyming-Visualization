Now I've Seen You


Ugly:

I've seen butterflies on blue bells

Drinking in the dew.

Cobwebbs in the sunlight

Shining, I've seen them too.

I've seen woodlands in the autumn,

Falling leaves of every shade and hue.

I thought I knew what beautiful was

But now I've seen you.....



I've seen waterfalls cascadeing

Sparkling in the light.

Damsel flies that dance their

Dance from morning 'til night.

I've seen rainbows reaching skyward

Passing through the clouds then fade from view.

I though I knew what beautiful was

But now I've seen you....



And though I've seen

The willow's weeping branches,

The misty morning air,

A clear and starry night

Has nothing to compare with you....



I've seen swallows in the summer

Wheeling over head.

I have seen the silk worm

Spinning gossamer thread.

I have seen the golden sunset

Over the horizon painting sky.

Of pinks and blues!



I thought I knew what beautiful was

But now I've seen you,

Now I've seen you,

Oh!  Now I've seen you!
