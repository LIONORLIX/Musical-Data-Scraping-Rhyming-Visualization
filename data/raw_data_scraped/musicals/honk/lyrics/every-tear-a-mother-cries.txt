Every Tear A Mother Cries


Ida:

Everytime I turn around

I expect you to appear,

Everyone may call my name

But it's your voice that I hear



Every moment that you're gone

Is a moment dark and gray,

Every tear a Mother cries is a dream that's washed away.



Every day seems to be

More empty than the last,

Everywhere the sun once shone

A shadow has been cast



Every moment that you're gone

Is a moment dark and gray,

Every tear a Mother cries is a dream that's washed away.



Every moment seems an hour,

Every hour lasts a day,

Every tear a Mother cries is a dream that's washed away...
