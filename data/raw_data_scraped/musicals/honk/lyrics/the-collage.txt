Drake:

As a drake my mistake was letting her go searching for my son and at one its not right

I`ve spent weeks filling beaks hearing daddy! Daddy! Daddy!

I`m depressed round the nest day and night



When Ida said she?d go, I had to let her,

ashamed because this apron suits her better



Where`s the joy in motherhood,

an endless round of chores that have to be done

And when you think you?ve seen the back of them,

you?ll find in actual fact you?re back at square one



There?s no joy in motherhood or if there is its something I just cant see

Yet Ida seems to cope with all of this,

and then on top of that she puts up with me



Duckling: (spoken) Daddy!

Drake: (spoken) Now what!



Ida:

I will search every pond I will search every stream, every river

And the broadest of bays and the widest of lakes must be crossed

While you are missing from my life, its me who feeling lost, without I feel I lost



Chorus:

Look at her it?s a shame that she wont face the fact

Look at her can?t she see the way the odds are stacked



Turkey: (spoken)

Have you heard anything from Ida yet?



Drake: (spoken)

Aye, the pigeon delivered the note this morning, it just says,

I?m here Pratts Bottom, I don?t know whether

that?s a place or if she?s just being offensive



Chorus:

Look at her nothing shakes her from her strong belief

Solo: Look at her????????????..................nothing shakes her strong belief

Chorus: Look at her it so hard to come to terms with grief

Solo: Look at her????????????....grief



Ida: (spoken)

And he?s about so high with a rather characteristic honk



Greylag: (spoken)

Sounds like that squaddy who shot through a while ago I say he shot through,

it was us who were shot through practically brought about our Trafalgar, wot



Dot: (spoken)

I think you mean Waterloo dear



Greylag: (spoken) Do I dear?



Chorus:

Look at her so convinced that she is getting near

Solo: Look at her????????????.......so convinced she?s getting near

Chorus: Look at her she may be a little late we fear

Solo: Loot at her????????????...she?s a little late we fear



Lowbutt: (spoken)

But how do we know you?re not a cat

Ida: (spoken) I beg your pardon



Lowbutt: (spoken)

Well the last duck who came by here turned out to be a tom cat,

one of those nasty transfeatherites

Queenie: (spoken) Did somebody say tom cat?



Chorus:

As each season slips away, sadly there?s a trend

Common sense would seem to say

There?s no happy end



Ida: (spoken) And he was last seen heading in the direction of Moorland Farm

Cat: (spoken) I say that?s north of here isn?t it

Ida: (spoken) Yes

Cat: (spoken) How very interesting

Ida: (spoken) You!
