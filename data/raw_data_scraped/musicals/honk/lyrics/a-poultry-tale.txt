A Poultry Tale


Drake:

In this backwater of England

Where the pace of life is slow

And the lillies on the lake are broad and lush,

We're all living here in Clover

And the mating season's over

So there won't be cause for anyone to blush.

In our land both green and pleasant

Every bantom, duck and phesant...

...If we had them, we'd be walking arm-in-arm

For our life is good and steady 'til we're plucked and oven-ready

It's a poultry tale

Of folk down on the farm...



There's a turkey with a gobble

Watch him stand and start to wobble,

When the rooster cock-a-doodles we get up,

We've got poulets, we've got chickens

We've got quails and... What the Dickens?!

It's a poultry tale of folk down on the farm!



There's a guineafowl that hisses

And that's Ida, she's my missus

So forgive me if I'm laying on the smarm,

She goes in for heated quacking to point out the skills I'm lacking



Company:

It's a poultry tale

Of folk down on the farm!



Come on down and don't be strangers

In our duckyard of free rangers

It's a poultry tale

Of folk down on the farm!



Ida:

Here where waterfowl have waddled

Little chicks get mollycoddled

For The Cat

Would like to do us grievous harm

He's our only source of worry

Feathers rarely get to flurry



Company:

It's a poultry tale

Of folk down on the farm!



Cat:

Ha!

How they flatter themselves

I've never shown much interest in this group,

I'll admit I'm quite a glutton but this feathered form of mutton

Wouldn't even make a palletable soup...

But

When those little ducklings hatch

That's a flavour you won't match

They're delicious!

And I just can't get enough,

As a fella who is feline you will see me make a beeline

For those tender little juicy balls of fluff!



(mad quacking noises)



Company:

In our waterfowl regatta

There's a moorhen fond of chatter

And a mandarin with oriental charm,

You'll find every goose or gander



Grace:

Though, of course, I'm rather grander!



Company:

It's a poultry tale of folk down on the farm.



We may strike some classic poses,

And we all have Parson noses,

But that doesn't mean you'll hear a single psalm...

For all reverence is rejected

Blatant fowl-play is expected

It's a poultry tale

Of folk down on the farm!



Come on down and don't be strangers

In our duckyard of free rangers

It's a poultry tale

It's a poultry tale

It's a poultry tale

Of folk down on the farm!
