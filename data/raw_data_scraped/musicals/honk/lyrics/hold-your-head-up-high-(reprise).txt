Hold Your Head Up High (Reprise)


Ida: Hold your head up high, hold your head up high

Ugly: It's not always so easy to hold your head up high

and appear bright and breezey.

I thought dreams were made for a reason but hope seems

to fade with each season and Mama,

you seem so far away.

Ida: Hold your head up high

Ugly: It's your voice, it's your voice I hear!

Ida: Everyday will seem to be more empty than the last.

Ugly: Hold your head up high

Ida:Everywhere the sun has shone a shadow has been cast.

Ugly: and all the while wandering, remincising,

Ida: Every moment that you're gone

Ugly: I keep wondering if she's missing me.

Ida: Is a moment dark and grey.

Ugly: In the way I miss her

Ida: Every tear a Mother cries is a dream that's washed away.



Both: Just knowing you're out there will help be get by.

Until the day we're reunited I will hold my head up high.
