Together


Cat: Madam I would be honoured, though I?m not of your ilk

If we could get together maybe share a dish of milk



Queenie: Sir I?d be delighted though it?s true you?re a scruff

But when one?s had things easy, one likes a bit of rough



Lowbutt: Queenie you loose cat!



Cat: Together on the tiles we will totter

Together we will sit on garden walls

Together we will make tin roofs seem hotter



Lowbutt: Together you?ll be throwing up fur balls



Queenie: Together we will build ourselves a cat flap

Together after dark we?ll file in



Both: Together we will snuggle for a cat nap



Lowbutt: Together you could string a violin



Have you forgotten dear, the clinic has confirmed

That they can fit you in you need to be de-wormed

And with your last attack you almost filled a sack

So maybe you should go



Its only fair to say that she is rather prone

To carry parasites, her fur is not her own

And on the hygiene front to be both frank and blunt

It?s better you don?t know



All thought I don?t wish to gripe I don?t think she?d be your type



Queenie and Cat: Together we will sing our own cats chorus

Together we will choose our favourite key

Together we will conquer all before us



Lowbutt: Together you could retard her fleas



You have to help me out

Its looking pretty grim

What would become of me if she should go with him

She?s gone all gooey eyed and I am terrified she?ll leave me on the shelf



(spoken) Go on then run!



(sung) Oh dear alas, alack the door was left ajar

The duckling has escaped he can?t have got that far

If you start making tracks you?re bound to hear his quacks



And catch him for yourself

Don?t let us delay your trip, he?ll soon be within your grip



(Instrumental)



Queenie: (spoken)

Oh! Oh no, don?t leave me,

forget the duckling we could open a can of something?

Lowbutt: (spoken) There, there dear he was never worth it



(sung) Together we can overcome this heartache

Together we?ve the strength to see it through

Both: Together as if nothing really happened

Together we will st-a-a-ay

Together we will st-a-a-ay

Together we will stay as me and you
