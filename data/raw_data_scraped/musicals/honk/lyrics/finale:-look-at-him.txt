Finale: Look At Him


All:

Look at him,

Did you ever see a finner bird?

Hark at him,

'Cause his honking is the best we've heard.



We are feeling rather small,

In this whole sha-bang.

Maybe you'll forgive us all,

And we hope, with enough soft soap, lead our gang



[ NOT SUNG ]



Ugly:

Of course I forgive you. I'm just happy to see you all again,

and to introduce you to someone. This is Penny.



Penny:

Hello.



Grace:

Welcome home, my dear. I've been thinking,

I'm getting very long in the bill,

and I feel the time is right for me to relinquish the Red Band...

Wear it with pride, my dear, for you are indeed the finest bird on the lake,

as I know I was in my day.

And! let it it be known that from this day forth,

the Red Band shall be known as the Cygnet Rings!



[ ALL APPLAUD, SINGING CONTINUES ]



All:

Look at him,

Look at us,

See the difference.



Why did we every think him a dud?

Drake:

I always knew that my family was blessed with royal blood.



[ NOT SUNG ]



Turkey:

Yes! YES!! YES!!!



All:

What?!



Turkey:

I made it through Christmas!



[ CHEERS AND CLAPS ]



All: Look at him

(Kids: Look at him)

All the splendour of a noble swan

(And we've got him as a brother)

Look at him

(Look at him)

From a duckling to a paragon

(We won't swap him for another)



Now that you're back on the lake

(Grace: You're back on the lake)

Promise you won't leave

(Promise you won't leave)

You're example's there to take

Just believe in yourself

Don't be left on the shelf

Feeling that all hope is dead and gone

And you may find in your own way

You're a swan,

HONK!
