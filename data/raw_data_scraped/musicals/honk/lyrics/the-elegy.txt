The Elegy


Chorus: An eerie mood descends the farm

It seems so strangely quiet

The rumour is the cat has had more roughage in his diet

All thought he was an ugly bird it hurts us now to say

that feathers have been sighted in the pussy?s litter tray



Maureen: (spoken) Ida I don?t mean to be rude but the description.

The donkey said he saw the cat walking away with a`well

who else around here looks like that



Ida: (spoken) Well I don?t believe it he was?IS a tough little duck

and I?m sure he can stand up to that mangy old tom



Maureen: (spoken) Well I?m sure he can but?

Ida: (spoken) He?s probably on his way back right now



Chorus: Poor Ida has our sympathy

She looks so sad and gloomy

But looking on the brighter side her nest is now more roomy

We find it rather difficult to say consoling things

Tonight the ugly duckling sleeps beneath an angels wings

Tonight the ugly duckling sleeps beneath an angels wings
