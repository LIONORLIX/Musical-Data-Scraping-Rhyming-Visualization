Pass The Football


Look at me now,

Four years of college,

Famous professors

Tutoring me;



Scholarship kid,

Everything paid for,

Food and vacations,

All of it free.



Day that i left,

Everyone gathered,

Their cheering still rings in my ears . . .



Ray wreck rah!

Rah wreck ray!

Rah wreck!

Wreck rah!

Rah wreck wreck!

W-e-c, r-e-k, r-e-q,

Wreck, we love you!



‘Cause i could pass that football

Like nothin’ You have ever seen!



Couldn’t spell a lick,

Couldn’t do arithmetic;

One and one made three,

Thought that dog was c-a-t,



But i could pass that football

Like nothin’ You have ever seen.



Couldn’t write my name,

Couldn’t translate ‘je vous aime’,

Never learned to read

Mother goose or andr’ Gide,



But i could pass that football

Like nothin’ You have ever seen.



Couldn’t figure riddles,

Puzzles made me pout:



Where the hell was moses when the lights went out’

I couldn’t even tell red from green,

Get those verbs through my bean,

But i was buddies with the dean

Like nothin’ You have ever seen.



Passed without a fuss

English lit and calculus.

Never had to cram,

Even passed the bar exam,



Because i passed that football

Like nothin’ You have ever seen.



Couldn’t dance for beans,

Mashed my girls to smithereens.

Sometimes blood was spilled,

Still my card was always filled,



‘Cause i could pass that football

Like nothin’ You have ever seen.





Then there was the week

Albert einstein came to speak:

Relativity!

Guess who introduced him’ Me!



‘Cause i could pass that football

Like nothin’ You have ever seen.



Had no table manners,

Used ta dunk my roll,

Always drunk the water from the fingerbowl.

Though i would not get up for any she,

The prexy’s mom -- age ninety-three --

Got up and gave her seat to me,

Like nothin’ You did ever see.



In our hall of fame,

There’s a statue with my name.

There we stand, by heck,

Lincoln, washington and wreck.

‘Cause i could pass that football

Like nothin’ You have ever seen!
