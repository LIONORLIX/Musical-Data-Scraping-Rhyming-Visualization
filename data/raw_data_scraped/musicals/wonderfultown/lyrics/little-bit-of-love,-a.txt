Little Bit Of Love, A


Mm--mmm --

I’m a little bit in love,

Never felt this way before.

Mm--mmm --

Just a little bit in love,

Or perhaps a little bit more.



When he

Looks at me,

Everything’s hazy and all out of focus.

When he

Touches me,

I’m in the spell of a strange hocus-pocus.

It’s so --

I don’t know.

I’m so --

I don’t know.

I don’t know -- but i know,

If it’s love,

Then it’s lovely!



Mm--mmm --

It’s so nice to be alive

When you meet someone who bewitches you.

Will he be my all,

Or did i just fall

A little bit,

A little bit in love’



Mm--mmm --

I’m a little bit in love,

Never felt this way before.

Mm--mmm --



Mm--mmm--

It's so nice to be alive

When you find someone who bewitches you.

Will he be my all,

Or did i just fall

A little bit,

A little bit in love’
