Ohio


Eileen and ruth



Why, oh why, oh why, oh

Why did i ever leave ohio?

Why did i wander to find what lies yonder

When life was so cozy at home?



Wond’ring while i wander,

Why did i fly?

Why did i roam?

Oh, why oh, why oh

Did i leave ohio?

Maybe i’d better go



Eileen       ruth home.

O -- h -- i -- o.



Eileen and ruth



Maybe i’d better go home.



Ruth



Now listen, eileen,

Ohio was stifling.

We just couldn’t wait to get out of the place,

With mom saying -- ‘ruth, what no date for this evening’’



Eileen



And pop with, ‘eileen, do be home, dear, by ten.’



Ruth and eileen



Ugh!



Ruth



The gossipy neighbors

And everyone yapping who’s going with whom



Eileen



And dating those drips that i’ve known since i’m four.



Ruth



The kiwanis club dance.



Eileen



On the basketball floor.



Ruth



Cousin maude with her lectures on sin



Ruth and eileen



What a bore!



Eileen



Jerry black!





Ruth



Cousin min!





Eileen



Ezra nye!





Ruth



Hannah finn!





Eileen



Hopeless!





Ruth



Babbity!





Eileen



Stuffy!



Ruth



Provincial!





Ruth and eileen



Thank heavens we’re free!



Why, oh why, oh why, oh --

Why did we ever leave Ohio!



Wond’ring while we wander,

Why did we fly?

Why did we roam?

Oh, why oh, why oh

Did we leave ohio?

Maybe we’d better go



Eileen      ruth home.

O -- h -- i -- o.



Ruth and eileen



Maybe we’d better go home.
