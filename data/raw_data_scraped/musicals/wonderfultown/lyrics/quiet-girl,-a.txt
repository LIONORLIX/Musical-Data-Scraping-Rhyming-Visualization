Quiet Girl, A


BAKER:

All right! Goodbye!

You've taught me my lesson!

Get mixed up with a genius from Ohio!

It happens overand over

I pick the sharp intellectual kind

Why couldn't this time be different

Why couldn't she - only be

Another kind - A different kind of girl



I love a quiet girl

I love a gentle girl

Warm as sunlight

Soft, soft as snow



Her smile, a tender smile

Her voice, a velvet voice

Sweet as music

Soft, soft as snow



When she is near me

The world's in repose

We need no words

She sees - she knows



But where is my quiet girl

Where is my gentle girl

Where is the special girl

Who is soft, soft as snow



Somewhere

Somewhere

My quiet girl



MUSIC BRIDGE



(Spoken) Ruth!



When she is near me

The world's in repose

We need no words

She sees - she knows



But where is my quiet girl

Where is my gentle girl

Where is the special girl

Who is soft, soft as snow



Somewhere

Somewhere

My quiet girl



RUTH:

(spoken)I know a quiet girl



I know a quiet girl

Hoping - waiting -

But he'll never know



MUSIC BRIDGE



I know a quiet girl

I know a gentle girl
