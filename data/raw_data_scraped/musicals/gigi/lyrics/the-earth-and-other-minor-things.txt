The Earth and Other Minor Things


The Postman or mama or Aunt Alicia

That`s all it seems to be a question of.



A pauper or a slave or Aunt Alicia

But not a mention anywhere of love.



What is there than anyone can teach?

If everything I want is out of reach?



I know about the earth and other minor things

Why caterpillars smile and summertime has wings

How if somewhere there?s always a dawn

The earth must be worth being on

But there`s something that makes a continual riddle of it

Why oh why I`m here in the middle of it all.

I don`t belong where the crowds are

Why don`t I go where the clouds are



I know about the leaves that fall and then are gone

How small a kite becomes with no one holding on

And I can`t be a cloud in a storm with no where to go to be warm

But as long as I can?t find a clue to the riddle of it

What am I to do in the middle of it all?



I don`t belong where the crowds

I don`t belong where the clouds are

Then where do I belong?
