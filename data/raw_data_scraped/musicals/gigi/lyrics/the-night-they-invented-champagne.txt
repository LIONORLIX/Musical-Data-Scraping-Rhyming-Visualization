The Night They Invented Champagne


Gigi:

The night they invented champagne

It's plain as it can be

They thought of you and me

The night they invented champagne

They absolutely knew

That all we'd want to do is

Fly to the sky on champagne

And shout to everyone in sight

That since that world began

No woman or a man has ever been as happy as we are tonight!



Gaston:

The night they invented champagne

It's plain as it can be

They thought of you and me

The night they invented champagne

They absolutely knew

That all we'd want to do is

Fly to the sky on champagne

And shout to everyone in sight

That since that world began

No woman or a man has ever been as happy as we are tonight!
