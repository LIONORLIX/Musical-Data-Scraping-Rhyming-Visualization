I'm Glad I'm Not Young Anymore


HONOR:

Poor boy!

Poor boy!

Down hearted and depressed and in a spin

Poor boy!

Poor boy!

Oh, youth can really do a fellow in!



How lovely to sit here in the shade

With none of the woes of man and maid

I'm glad I'm not young anymore.

The rivals that don't exist at all.

The feeling you're only two feet tall.

I'm glad that I'm not young anymore.



No more confusion

No morning-after surprise.

No more self delusion

That when you 're telling those lies

She isn't wise...

And even if love comes through the door

The can that goes on forevermore.

Forever more is shorter than before.

Oh, I'm so glad that I'm not young anymore.



The tiny remark that tortures you

The fear that your friends won't like her too

I'm glad that I'm not young anymore

The longing to end the stale affair

Until you find out she doesn't care

I'm glad that I'm not young anymore.



No more frustration

No star-crossed lover am I

No aggravation

Just one reluctant reply

"Lady, goodbye!"



The fountain of youth

Is --

Methuselah is my patron saint

I've never been so comfortable before

Oh, I'm so glad that I am not young anymore!
