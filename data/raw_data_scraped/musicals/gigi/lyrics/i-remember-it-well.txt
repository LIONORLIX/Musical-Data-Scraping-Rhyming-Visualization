I Remember It Well


HONOR:

We met at nine

GRANDMAMA:

We met at eight

HONOR:

I was on time

GRANDMAMA:

No, you were late

HONOR:

Ah yes, I remember it well.

We dined with friends

GRANDMAMA:

We dined alone.

HONOR:

A tenor sang

GRANDMAMA:

A baritone.

HONOR:

I remember it well.

That dazzling April moon!

GRANDMAMA:

There was none that night.

And the month was June

HONOR:

That's right, that's right.

GRANDMAMA:

It warms my heart

To know that you

Remember still

The way you do

HONOR:

Ah yes, I remember it well.

How often I've thought of that Friday--

GRANDMAMA:

Monday--

HONOR:

Night, when we had our last rendezvous

And somehow I foolishly wondered if you might

By some chance be thinkin' of it too

That carriage ride

GRANDMAMA:

You walked me home

HONOR:

You lost a glove

GRANDMAMA:

I lost a comb

HONOR:

Ah yes, I remember it well.

That brilliant sky!

GRANDMAMA:

We had some rain

HONOR:

Those Russian songs

GRANDMAMA:

From sunny Spain

HONOR:

Ah yes, I remember it well.

You wore a gown of gold

GRANDMAMA:

I was all in blue

HONOR:

Am I getting old?

GRANDMAMA:

Oh no, not you!

How strong you were

How young and gay

A prince of love

In every way

HONOR:

Ah yes, I remember it well.
