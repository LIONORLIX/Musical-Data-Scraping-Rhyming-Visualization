She Is Not Thinking of Me


Gaston:

She's so gay tonight

She's like spring tonight

She's a rollicking, frollicking thing tonight

So disarming, soft and charming

She is not thinking of me

No, she's not thinking of me



In her eyes tonight

There's a glow tonight

They're so bright they could light

Fountainbleu tonight

She's so gracious

So vivacious

She is not thinking of me



Bless her little heart

Crooked to the core

Acting out a part

What a rollicking, frollicking bore!



She's such fun tonight

She's a treat tonight

You could spread her on bread

She's so sweet tonight

So devoted, sugar-coated

That it's heart-warming to see

Oh, she's simmering with love

Oh, she's shimmering with love

Oh, she's not thinking of me!



She is not thinking of me

Someone has set her on fire

Is is Jacques?

Is it Paul or Leon?

Who's turning her furnace up higher?

Oh she's hot but it's not

For Gaston!



Oh, she's gay tonight

Oh, so gay tonight

A gigantic romantic cliche tonight

How she blushes

How she gushes

How she fills me with ennui!

She's so ooh la la la la

So untrue la la la la!

Oh, she's not thinking of me!
