The White House At Night


February 24th

A spell of fine soft weather.

Tonight, on my way home, I took a long look at

the president's house.

The white portico--palace like, tall, round columns.

The tender and soft moonlight flooding the pale marble,

and making peculiar, faint languishing shades

--not shadows.

Everywhere a soft transparent hazy, thin, blue moon-lace

hanging in the air.

Everything so white, so pure and dazzling--yet soft.

The White House of our future dreams and dramas--

full of reality, full of illusion--the White House of our

land, and of beauty and of the night -- sentries at the gate--

silent, pacing blue overcoats--not stopping me, but eyeing

me with sharp eyes--whichever way I move.
