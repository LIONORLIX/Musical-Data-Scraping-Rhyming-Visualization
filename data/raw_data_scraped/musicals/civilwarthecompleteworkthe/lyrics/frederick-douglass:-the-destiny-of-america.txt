Frederick Douglass: The Destiny Of America


Liberty won by white men would lose half its luster. "Who would be free

themselves must strike the first blow." Better even die free, than live slaves.

The relation between the white and colored people of this country is the great,

paramount, imperative and all-consuming question for this age and nation to

solve. The destiny of the colored American is the destiny of America.
