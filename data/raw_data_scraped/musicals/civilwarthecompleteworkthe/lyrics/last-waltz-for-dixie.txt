Last Waltz For Dixie


Here tonight...

As I look upon the faces of my brothers

I remember all the others who are gone

Safe in his grace

Watching over this place

With the dawn

Into his hands we shall surrender to his glory

And when they tell the story let them say

Of the sons of the Gray

Not one turned away

It's the last waltz for Dixie

It's the last song she'll sing

So play it with pride

For all those who died

And the spirit inside you

That's the Dixie in me

I believe

There has never been a group of men so splendid

Or a cause so well-defended as our own

Be it heaven or hell

Hail and farewell

It's the last waltz for Dixie

It's the last song she'll sing

So play it with pride

For all those who died

And the spirit inside you

That's the dixie in me

For all we hold dear

The road ahead is clear

For all the things we honor

The moment is here

It's the last waltz for Dixie

It's the last song she'll sing

So play it with pride

For all those who died

And the spirit inside you

That's the Dixie in me
