The Day The Sun Stood Still


We were young and bound for glory

Itchin' for a fight like you

Bringin hell and purgatory

To the boys who wore the Blue

And I thought I'd seen it all

Till the day night wouldn't fall

Oh how the sun did blaze

Wouldn't go down for days

I got shot and lost my rifle

When the first wave hit the rise

And the guns rolled out like thunder

And the black smoke burned my eyes

And I watched it all unfold

Just the way the Bible Told

Joshua's endless day

Keepin' the night at bay

And the soldiers kept a' comin'

Till the ground looked like a sea

Of Blue and Gray

And I watched them from a distance

Wondrin' if I would've fought or run away

The day the sun stood still

How they beat the bloody drums

And the seconds moved like hours

But the sunset never comes

And the cannons shake the ground

And the bullets test your will

Even shadows found no cover

On that Godforsaken hill

The day the sun stood still

And I watched them lean their shoulders

To the fearful hail of lead

And I prayed for night to save us

And I cried and bowed my head

But the sun just kept a' creepin'

'Cross a cold indifferent sky

Castin' a deadly glow

On all the men below

All the hours in a lifetime

Don't add up to one whole minute

In that sun

And the heroes and the cowards

Look the same when they have fallen

By the gun

The day the sun stood still

And the North and South looked west

But the evening star was sleeping

And the daylight wouldn't rest

Out on the killing floor

The red sun on the hill

Shinin' down on all the dead men

With a strange and eerie chill

The day the sun stood still

Do not judge what your brother does

Till you've walked a mile

Rank by bloody file

Who's to say if you'll run or stay and fight?

The day the sun stood still

Is just beneath the skin

In the soul of every soldier

Every battle that he's in

The day the sun stood still

Will haunt your dreams at night

And stalk your every sunrise

Though you will not know it till

The day the sun stands still

How they'll beat the bloody drums

And the seconds move like hours

But the sunset never comes

And the cannons shake the ground

And the bullets test your will

Even shadows find no cover

On some godforsaken hill on

The day the sun stood still
