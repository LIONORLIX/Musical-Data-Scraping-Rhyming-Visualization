Freedom's Child


Look at these hands...

I stole them from my master

Look through these eyes...

Imagine what they've seen

This long, dark night

Must now come to an end

A holy light

Is just around the bend

Today we fight

For all the ground in between

The words we say and what we really mean

So let the bells of freedom ring

Let the dogs of war run wild

From out the age of darkness bring

The birth of freedom's child

Look at these words:

"To God, all men are equal"

Write them again

In letters black and strong

Till all are free

We'll all live as a slave

We all must be

The land born to the brave

Till you and me

Can find a place to belong

Where we believe what isn't right

Must be wrong

So let the bells of freedom ring

Let the dogs of war run wild

From out the age of darkness bring

The birth of freedom's child

So throw my brother's chains away

No more to be exiled

And get down on your knees and pray

We'll all be freedom's child

All of those years standing outside

Knocking on heaven's door

All of those tears all of us cried

Give us our freedom...Nothing less and

Nothing more

...We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that

they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among

these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness...

So let the bells of freedom ring

Let the dogs of war run wild

From out the age of darkness bring

The birth of freedom's child

So throw my brother's chains away

No more to be exiled

And get down on your knees and pray

We'll all be freedom's child
