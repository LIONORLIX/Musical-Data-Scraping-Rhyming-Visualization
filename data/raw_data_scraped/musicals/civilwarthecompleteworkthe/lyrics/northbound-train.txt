Northbound Train


I read your letter about a hundred times today.

Thought I'd better write before I'm on my way.

We're movin' now...

Just where, I can't say.

The Indiana snow fell mighty deep I hear.

So winter wheat should fetch a handsome price this year.

We'll be alright when I get outta here.

One more month livin' by the sword...

One last valley to march through...

Thirty days 'til i climb aboard that northbound train...

Back home to you.

I met a southern boy down here in Tennessee.

He must've been about the same age as me

Both as scared as two men could be...

We talked across the lines 'til break of day,

And while we talked there wasn't any blue or gray.

Just some things two farm-boys will say.

His voice dropped sweet as a mockingbird.

The drownin' rain and weather.

Once that night we both swore we heard the whistle call...

Of a northbound train.

I asked him what he was fighting for.

He said' "'Cuz Yankee, your down here."

I said, "That's something I can understand."

But I'm the son of an Indian, a volunteer...

Just tryin' to march through all this fear...

Long enough to catch that northbound train...

And Abby when I finally get back home to you...

Don't ask me nothin' 'bout the things I've had to do.

It'd chill your soul...

and break your heart in two.

I ain't the same, Lord knows I've seen some fearful things.

And I've heard the breathless beat of angel's wings.

From the bullets fly, and the saber swings.

One more month livin' by the sword...

One last valley to march through...

Thirty days 'til i climb aboard that northbound train...

Talkin' bout a northbound train.

Oh that northbound train.
