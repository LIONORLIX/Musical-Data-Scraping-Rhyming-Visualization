River Jordan


We break our backs for the master's pleasure

Just waitin' for the sweet old by and by

Singin' "Go Down Moses" at the levee

Till we lay our burden down and die

But they say there's a new wind blowin'

Down by the mighty Mississippi dressed in blue

Shakin' loose these chains that bind me

Till this endless night is finally through

... So now

Meet me by the River Jordan

Knee-deep in a risin' tide

We will climb aboard that boat called freedom

And we'll all sail over to the other side

Sail on

Just sail, sail on

Sail on over to the other side

Sail, sail on

Just sail on

Just sail on over to the other side

Meet me by the River Jordan

Knee-deep in a risin' tide

We'll climb aboard that boat called freedom

And we'll all sail on over to the other side

We'll be singin' Halleluja

When this mis'ry sure 'nough be passed

We'll be singin' Halleluja

Halleluja, we are now free at last

Hold on... Hold on

When you live in the east of Eden you've

Got to pray

That you'll find yourself in paradise one day

Meet me by the River Jordan

Knee-deep in a risin' tide

We'll climb aboard that boat called freedom

And we'll all sail on over to the other side

Meet me by the River Jordan

Knee-deep in a risin' tide

We'll climb aboard that boat called freedom

And we'll sail right on over to the other side

We'll be singin' Halleluja

When this mis'ry sure 'nough be passed

We'll be singin' Halleluja

Halleluja, we are now free at last

Hold on ... Hold on

When you live in the East of Eden you've

Got to pray

That you'll find yourself in paradise one day

Meet me by the River Jordan

Knee-deep in a risin' tide

We'll climb aboard that boat called freedom

And we'll all sail right on over to the

Other side.
