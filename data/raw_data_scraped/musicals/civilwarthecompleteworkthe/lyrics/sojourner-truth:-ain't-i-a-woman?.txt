Sojourner Truth: Ain't I A Woman?


That man over there says that women need to be helped into carriages and lifted

over ditches, and to have the best place wherever. Nobody ever helps me into

carriages or over mud puddles, or gives me any best place. And ain't I a woman?

Look at me! I have ploughed and planted and gathered into barns and no man could

head [do better than] me. And ain't I a woman? I could work as much and eat as

much as a man-when I could get it-and bear the lash as well. And ain't I a

woman? I have borne thirteen children and seen most all sold off to slavery, and

when I cried out with my mother's grief, none but Jesus heard me. And ain't I a

woman?
