I Never Knew His Name


I never knew his name

As he called to me

Pleading with his eyes

Suddenly so wise

Trying not to cry

Now he's gone and I

Never knew his name

I've seen his kind before

Rising to his fall

God, he was so young

Like a song half sung

Interrupted by

Someone just as shy

Who never knew his name

The true cost of honor

Is suddenly too clear

In measures too full and dear

He always looks the same

Dressed in blue or gray

All the life he'll miss

Girls he'll never kiss

Things he'll never try

Unaware that I

Never knew his name

I never knew his name

Guess it's just as well

So I do my part

Hiding from my heart

Whispering goodbye

Thanking God that I

Never knew his name
