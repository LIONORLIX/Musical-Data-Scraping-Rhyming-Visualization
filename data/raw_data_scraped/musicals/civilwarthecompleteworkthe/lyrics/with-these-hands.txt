With These Hands


Male



Look at these hands

They are battlescarred and weary

And they're achin' for the one thing

That can heal the pain

For the feel of you at sundown

Runnin' fire through my veins



Female



Look at these hands

They've been holdin' on and prayin'

And they're trembling for your quiet easy touch

Look at these hands reaching out for the man

I love too much



Male



Come to me now

Whisper secrets soft and low



Female



Lay here beside me

Darlin' don't let me go



Together



With these hands I could hold you forever

With this heart I will always be true

Just like God in his heaven

May you always be there

Every time that these hands reach for you



Male



Look at these eyes

They have seen so many devils

They can hardly recognize the angel here



Female



I only know when I look in your eyes

You calm all my fears



Male



We've got tonight

Darlin' we can't ask for more



Female



Just hold me tight

Leave the world outside the door



Together



With these eyes I could see you forever

With this heart I will always be true

Like the stars in the heavens

My love will be there

Every time these eyes look at you



Male



With these hands



Female



With this heart



Male



I'll be there..



Female



I'll be there...



Together



With these hands I could hold you forever

With this heart I will always be true

Just like God in his heaven

May you always be there

Every time that these hands reach for you

Just like God in his heaven

My love will be there



Male



Every time that these hands reach for you



Female



Every time that these hands reach for you
