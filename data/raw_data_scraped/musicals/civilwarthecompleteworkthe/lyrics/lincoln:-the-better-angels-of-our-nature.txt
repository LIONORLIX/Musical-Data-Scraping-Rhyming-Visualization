Lincoln: The Better Angels Of Our Nature


In your hands, my dissatisfied countrymen,

and not in mine

is the momentous issue of Civil War.

The government will not assail you

You have no conflicts, without being yourselves the aggressions.

We are not enemies, but friends.

We must not be enemies.

Though passion may have strained,

it must not break our bonds of affection.

The mystic chords of memories,

stretching from every battlefield and patriot grave

to every living heart all across this broad land

will yet swell the chorus of the Union,

when again touched, as surely they will be

By the better angels of our nature.

For if destruction be our lot, we must ourselves be its author.

As a nation of Free Men, we must live

through all time, or die of suicide.
