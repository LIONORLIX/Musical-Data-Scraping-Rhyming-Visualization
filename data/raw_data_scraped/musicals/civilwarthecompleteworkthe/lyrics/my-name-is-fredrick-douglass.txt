My Name Is Fredrick Douglass


My name is Frederick Douglass.

I am the son of a slave and a white man.

I appear before you this evening as a theif and a robber.

I stole this head, these limbs, this body, from my mster, and ran off with them.

I ask you:

Are the principles of political freedom and natural justice embodied in the

Declaration of Independence extended to us?

Where slavery is, there liberty cannot be.

Where liberty is, there slavery cannot be.

The contest must now be decided

And decided forever, which of the two freedom or slavery

shall give law to this republic.

Let the conflict come.
