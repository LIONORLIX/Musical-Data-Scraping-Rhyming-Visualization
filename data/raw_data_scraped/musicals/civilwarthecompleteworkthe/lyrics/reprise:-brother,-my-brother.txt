Reprise: Brother, My Brother


A line in long array

Where they wind betwixt the green

Their arms flash in the sun

But their faces can't be seen

Behold the silv'ry river

Where their horses stop to drink

Scarlet blue and golden spurs

A chain you can't unlink

Keep your still indifferent sun

That will never warm my fear

Keep your cold and endless winter

And this old and friendless year

Give me women and their ways

And their complicated eyes

Give me respite from these days

And the wisdom to be wise
