By The Sword/Sons Of Dixie


Union Soldiers



I remember the first day well fell in for drill

We were green as a new dollar bill

I remember your mamma just cried through the night

When her Charlie-boy left for the fight

Now the battle is near

And the moment is here

It's the Union forever

When the Blue meets the Gray

Every rebel will pay

By the sword...

By the sword...

By the sword...

By the vow we have taken

Now we awaken

Our flag flying high

We will live or we'll die

By the sword



Confederate Soldiers



I can shoot a mounted horseman

From a half a mile away

I can take a hill and hold it till

We meet on judgement day

I will cut a dashing figure

I will make the ladies swoon

I'll be back by fall to kiss 'em all

If the war don't end too soon

We'll make 'em all skedaddle

Long before the cotton's high

We can whoop 'em in a battle

Sure 'nough whoop 'em do or die

When the Sons of Dixie take to the field

Then the battle is won

For we never will yield

When the Sons of Dixie fire their guns

Then we'll all see how fast

That a scared Yankee runs



Union Soldiers



When we lick 'em...

We'll get home before the first snow

With a chest full of medals to show

When we lick 'em...

They'll be one hellatious parade

Yeah, and maybe by then we'll get paid!

All for one, one for all

So let's open the ball

It's the union forever

By the angels above

By all that we love...

By the sword...

By the sword...

By the sword...

We will march through the fire

We'll climb ever higher

By the dawn's early light

We will stand up and fight

By the sword



Confederate Soldiers



I won't let no damn Yankee

Tell me how I'm gonna live

I will not forget and you can bet

I ain't tendin' to forgive

So let's polish up our muskets

And give the rebel yell

We'll chase 'em back to Washington

Or send 'em all to hell

We'll send 'em all a' runnin'

From the warm Virginia sun

So let 'em come a' gunnin'

And we'll show 'em how it's done

When the sons of Dixie

Take to the field

Then the battle is won

For we never will yield

When the Sons of Dixie

Fire their guns

Then we'll all see how fast

That a scared Yankee runs



All Soldiers



Now the battle is near

And the moment is here

It's (the Union/Old Dixie) forever

When the Blue meets the Gray

Every (Rebel/Yankee) will pay

When the Sons of Dixie

Take to the field

(By the sword...)

Then the battle is won

(By the sword...)

For we never will yield

When the Sons of Dixie

Fire their guns

(By the sword...)

Then we'll all see how fast

(By the sword...)

That a scared Yankee runs

With our flag flying high

We will live or we'll die

By the sword
