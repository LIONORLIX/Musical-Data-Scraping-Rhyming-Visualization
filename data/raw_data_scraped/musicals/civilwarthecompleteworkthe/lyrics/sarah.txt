Sarah


Oh Sarah, my Sarah I fear I must go

And leave you to move on your own

A hard wind is risin and fixin to blow

And scatter the thoughts we have known

But know that I will always be with you

Watching from above

Oh Sarah, my Sarah my Love.



I see you my Sarah when I close my eyes

It's summer and we're at the fair

A laughter so haunting so full of surprise

Drifts back like a ghost through the air

So when you feel the cool breeze passing by

Know that I am there

As real as the words of my prayer



If fate is kind I'll soon be by your side

And always know you can find me deep inside



Oh Sarah, my Sarah, I whisper your name

And all my thoughts run back to you

My heart is the candle, and your heart's the flame

That burns with a fire so true

And someday soon I know we'll meet again

Until then I swear, I swear

I love you, my Sarah

Forever and always

And always my heart will be there
