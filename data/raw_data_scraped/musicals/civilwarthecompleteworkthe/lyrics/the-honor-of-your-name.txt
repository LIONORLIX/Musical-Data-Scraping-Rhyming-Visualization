The Honor Of Your Name


Today a man came to our door,

all dressed in black with news of war.

A face I've never seen before,

And, Bill, I never will forget him,

I knew at once that you were gone,

He tipped his hat and then moved on.

And left my world a cold and empty space.

Such a lonely place.

But for the promise,

That we made so long ago,

For the nights,

When you held me in your arms,

I will keep life's fragile flame,

For the honor of your name.

I don't know what to do right now,

Except to struggle on somehow

I've learned to sow, I'll learn to plow,

And Bill, I never will forget you.

The kids and I might move out west,

I'll take our dream and leave the rest.

There's nothin' for my broken heart to

do,

'Cept write these words to you.

For the promise,

That we made so long ago.

For the love,

All the love that will not die.

I will keep life's fragile flame,

For the honor of your name.

Maybe someday when I'm stronger,

I will look back on this day

and understand all the reasons why

the good Lord took you away.

But for the promise,

That we made so long ago

For the man,

That I see in our son's eyes

I will keep life's fragile flame,

For the honor of your name.
