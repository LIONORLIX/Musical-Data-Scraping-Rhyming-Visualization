How Many Devils?


Male 1



One, two

Pick 'em up and put 'em down again

And watch the miles roll by



Male 2



Three, four

Pick 'em up and put 'em down again

Until you stop one and you die



Male 3



One, two

Pick 'em up and put 'em down 'till

Massa Robert tells us to sleep



Male 4



Three, four

When the hell did shoes get so damn dear

And life become so damn cheap?



Male 5



One, two

Those damn Yankees ain't as give up easy

As we thought they would be



Male 6



Three, four

Those damn Yankees ain't as near as scared

Or half as hungry as me



Male 7



One, two

Pick 'em up and put 'em down again

Is all a body can do



Male 8



Three, four

Pick 'em up and put 'em down again

Until this bloody war is through



All



How many miles, how many fears

How many days, how many years

How many rivers of blood, sweat and tears?

How many times into the fray

How many men won't walk away

How many hells filled with

How many devils to pay?



Male 9



One, two

Pick 'em up and put 'em down again

And watch the miles roll on



Male 10



Three, four

Pick 'em up and put 'em down again

Until your strength is nearly gone



Male 11



One, two

Pick 'em up and put 'em down again

And dream of home safe and sound



Male 12



Three, four

Pick 'em up and put 'em down again

Until we're six feet underground



All



How many miles dead on our feet

Drenched to the bone, baked in the heat

Paying for ground with another retreat

How many times into the fray

How many men won't walk away

How many hells filled with

How many devils to pay?



Male 13



Bodies all lay in the tall summer grass

Swollen and butchered and still



Male 14



Measuring miles by the dead that you pass

Measuring life by the men that you kill



All



How many days, how many more

How many men lost to this war

I can't remember what we're fighting for

How many times into the fray

How many men won't walk away

How many hells filled with

How many devils to pay?
