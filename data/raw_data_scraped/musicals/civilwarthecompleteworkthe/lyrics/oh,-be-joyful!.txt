Oh, Be Joyful!


Male 1



When this war is over

And we all have passed away

There'll be some damn fool in some damn school

Who'll write about today

He'll tell them how we all survived

This bullcrap every day

And never said that thing it was

That helped along the way



All



Oh be joyful...makes my troubles disappear

A cup of oh be joyful makes me joyful I am here

Oh be joyful... Only you can set me free

If you're good enough for U.S. Grant

You're good good enough for me



Male 2



We get up every morning

And we march through al lthis mud

Always tonin' this and liftin' that

And eatin' some ole' spud



Male 3



And if you find a woman

You are bound to catch the crud

But there is always one thing

That will ossify the blood



All



Oh be joyful... makes my troubles disappear

A cup of Oh be joyful makes me joyful I am here

Oh be joyful... only you can set me free

If you're good enough for U.S. Grant

You're good enough for me

Bad shoes, bad food, lousy brass

Oh be joyful save my ass



Male 4



Well, we march and do the double-quick

This sergeant's too damn rough

This Dixie mud is mighty slick

And this bread is hard and tough

That's the crap they put us through

But brother we obey

So thank God for his nectar

That will get us through the day



All



Oh be joyful... makes my troubles disappear

A cup of oh be joyful makes me joyful I am here

Oh be joyful...only you can set me free

If you're good enough for U.S. Grant

You're good enough for me



Male 5



John Brown is lyin' in his grave

And son, you would be too

If you ate this crap they gave us

It woudl turn your innards blue

I don't know but I been told

A soldier's life is hell

But son, I'll giv eyou somethin'

That'll get ya' mighty well



All



Oh be joyful...makes my troubles disappear

A cup of oh be joyful makes me joyful I am here

Oh be joyful...only you can set me free

If you're good enough for U.S. Grant

You're good enough for me

Bad shoes, bad food, lousy brass

Oh be joyful save my ass



Male 6



Our father who art in Washington

Abraham be thy name

Thy will be done to everyone

And Dixie take the blame

Give us our daily ration

Of crackers, salt, and pork

For thine might be the power

But let us pull the cork

The sergeant's too damn rough

This Dixie mud is mighty slick



All



Oh be joyful...makes my troubles disappear

A cup of oh be joyful makes me joyful I am here

Oh be joyful...only you can set me free

If you're good enough for U.S. Grant

You're good enough for me

Oh be joyful...Makes my troubles disappear

A cup of oh be joyful makes me joyful I am here

Oh be joyful...Only you can set me free

If you're good enough for U.S. Grant

You're good enough for me.
