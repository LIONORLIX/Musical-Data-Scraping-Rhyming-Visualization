Dear World


Someone has wounded you, dear world,

Someone has poisoned you, dear world.

And those who love you defiantly insist

That you get off that critical list.

So make your recovery quick, world,

We're sick of having a sick world.

We want you dancing tomorrow afternoon,

So be a dear world,

Take the stitches out, dear world,

Rip the bandage off, dear world.

And get well soon!



Please take your medicine, dear world,

Please keep your pressure down, dear world.

Promise to thrive on each word your doctor speaks,

He'll bring the roses back to your cheeks.

For you've been a pallid and blah world,

Stick out your tongue and say "Ahh," world.

We'll give you plasma and tonic, by the spoon,

So be a dear world,

Take your medicine, dear world,

Keep your pressure down, dear world,

And get well soon!



Please keep your fever down, dear world,

Please keep your courage up, dear world.

Your vim and vigor is very sorely missed,

He'll bring the roses back to your cheeks.

Help us declare you "Patient dismissed."

And stand on your crutches with pride, world.

You've got to save your own hide, world.

We'll bring you lilacs until you're back in tune

So be a dear world,

Keep your fever down, dear world,

Keep your courage up, dear world.

And get well soon!
