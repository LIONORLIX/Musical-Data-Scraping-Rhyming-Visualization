I Don't Want to Know


If music is no longer lovely,

If laughter is no longer lilting,

If lovers are no longer loving,

Then I don't want to know.



If summer is no longer carefree,

If children are no longer singing,

If people are no longer happy,

Then I don't want to know.



Let me hide ev'ry truth from my eyes with the back of my hand,

Let me live in a world full of lies with my head in the sand.

For my memories all are exciting.

My memories all are enchanted,

My memories burn in my mead with a steady glow;

So if, my friends, if love is dead,

I don't want to know.
