I Never Said I Love You


I've walked in the dawn on somebody's arm,

And looked at the lights along the shore;

But I've never said I love you,

So when I say I love you,

He'll know I've never loved before.



I've touched in the dark and laughed in the rain,

And listened to all the old clich?s;

But I've never said I love you,

I'm saving my "I love you"

For someone worthy of the phrase.

For somebody wise and strong and tall;

And yet he may not be that at all.



I only know we'll turn and we'll look,

We'll nod and we'll know

We'll stare and we'll smile

And then and then

I'll gratefully say I love you,

So when I say I love you,

He'll know I've never loved before;

He'll know I'll never love again!
