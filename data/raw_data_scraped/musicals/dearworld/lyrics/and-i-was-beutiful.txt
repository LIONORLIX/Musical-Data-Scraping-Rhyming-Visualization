And I Was Beutiful


He stood and looked at me

And I was beautiful,

For it was beautiful how he believed in me.

His love was strong enough to make me anything,

So I was ev'rything he wanted me to be.

But then he walked away and too my smile with him,

And now the years blur by, but ev'ry now and then,

I stop and think of him and how he looked at me,

And all at once I'm beautiful again.

But then he walked away and too my smile with him,

And now the years blur by, but ev'ry now and then,

I stop and think of him and how he looked at me,

And all at once I'm beautiful again.

For a moment I'm beautiful again.
