Each Tomorrow Morning (Reprise)


[JULIAN]

If your world falls flat on its face today

You can erase today

Tomorrow morning

You'll discover all of your past mistakes

Gone when the world awakes

Tomorrow morning



You will see your life in a different light

Crystal and crisp and clear and quite

Worth beginning over

There's no long lost star that you cannot reach

For your perfect day starts each

Tomorrow morning

You're brave

Tomorrow morning

You're strong

Tomorrow morning

You can begin again
