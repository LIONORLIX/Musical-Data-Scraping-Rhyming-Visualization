One Person


One person can beat a drum

And make enough noise for ten;

One person can blow a horn

And that little boom

And that little blare

Can make a hundreds others care.



And one person can hold a torch

And light up the sky again.

And one little voice that's squeaking a song,

Can make a million voices strong.



If one person can beat a drum,

And one person can blow a horn,

If one person can hold a torch,

Then one person can change the world!



There may be an army of them

And only a handful of us,

And how can a poor little band fight a mighty regime.

There may be a legion of them,

And only a parcel of us,

But it isn't the size of the fist,

It's the size of a dream!
