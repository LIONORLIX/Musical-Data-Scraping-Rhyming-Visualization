The Spring Of Next Year


There will be a sweet taste in the air

From industrial waste in the air

And your eyelids will smart from the sting of the smog in the spring of next year



There will be a black slick on the Seine

And the sludge will be thick on the Seine

And your eardrums will thrill to the ring of the axe in the spring of next year



Ah, the apple trees blooming

As they're crushed into pulp

There'll be smokestacks consuming

Each availabl? gulp

That's inhalable



But the moment most thrilling b?gins

When the pneumatic drilling begins

It's a song that all Paris will sing in the bountiful spring of next year



Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah



You'll be watching the statues corrode

We'll be hearing the fountains explode

It's a song that the hatchets will ring and the derricks will swing and all Paris will sing in the bountiful spring of next year
