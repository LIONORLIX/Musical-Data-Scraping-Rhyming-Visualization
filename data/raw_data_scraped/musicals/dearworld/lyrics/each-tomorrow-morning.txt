Each Tomorrow Morning


If the world falls flat on its face today,

You can erase today tomorrow morning.

You'll discover all of your past mistakes

Gone when the world awakes tomorrow morning.

You will see your life in a diff'rent light,

Crystal and crisp and clear and quite worth beginning over.

There's no long lost star that you cannot reach,

For your perfect day starts each tomorrow morning,

You're brave, tomorrow morning,

You're strong, tomorrow morning

You can begin again!



If the world falls flat on its face today,

You can erase today tomorrow morning.

You'll discover all of your past mistakes

Gone when the world awakes tomorrow morning.

You'll wake up the luckiest man on earth,

Proud that your little life is worth going on forever.

There's no long lost star that you cannot reach,

For your perfect day starts each tomorrow morning,

You're brave, tomorrow morning,

You're strong, tomorrow morning

You can begin again!
