Kiss Her Now


Before you half remember what her smile was like,

Before you half recall the day you found her,

Kiss her now, while she's young,

Kiss her now, while she's yours,

Kiss her now, while she needs your arms around her.

For if you let a moment come between you now,

It soon becomes a day, a year, a lifetime,

Blink your eye, turn your head, and you've lost her.

And you'll spend half your life wond'ring how.

So before you forget how you loved her,

Kiss her now,

Kiss her now,

Kiss her now.

It soon becomes a day, a year, a lifetime,

Blink your eye, turn your head, and you've lost her.

And you'll spend half your life wond'ring how.

So before you forget how you loved her,

Kiss her now,

Kiss her now,

Kiss her now.
