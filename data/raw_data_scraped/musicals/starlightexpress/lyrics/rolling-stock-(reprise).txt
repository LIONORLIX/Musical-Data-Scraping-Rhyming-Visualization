Rolling Stock (Reprise)


Greaseball & Gang:

I'm just the fastest thing you'll ever see.

That streak of lightning you just missed was me.

Don't stop now - we gotta keep it going all night.

Rolling Stock! Rolling Stock!

You got no wheels, you don't know how it feels.

Rolling Stock! Rolling Stock!

You got no lovers if you got no wheels.



Don't try to show you can go faster than me.

This is my back view and it's all you'll see.

Don't stop now - we gotta keep it going all night.

Rolling stock! We're Rolling Stock!



So get the motion in your wheels somehow.

The racing action's starting here and now.

Don't stop now - we gotta keep it going all night.

Rolling Stock! Rolling Stock!

Rolling Stock! Rolling Stock!

Rolling Stock! Rolling Stock!
