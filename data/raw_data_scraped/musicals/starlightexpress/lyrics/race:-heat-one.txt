Race: Heat One


CONTROL

Heat one. Heat one. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two,

one. Trains gone! Four trains going for two final places. Greaseball and

Espresso are the early leaders with Nintendo pressing in third. Well, that's

not in the rule book. No-one messes with the champion! Up the nursery slope.

It's still Greaseball but Espresso's looking good! It's the double whammy

from Electra and the Champion! Across the high level, it's Greaseball,

Electra, Nintendo and Espresso. Nintendo takes Electra and Nintendo passes

Greaseball! Don't play with electricity - the champ leads - this is getting

hot! Nintendo must win. He's overdone it. Nintendo crashes! Winner of heat

one: Greaseball the diesel with Electra in second place. Greaseball and

Electra have a place in the final.
