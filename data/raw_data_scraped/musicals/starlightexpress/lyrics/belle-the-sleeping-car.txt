Belle the Sleeping Car


Looks and youth ain't everything

Experience is a quality that counts for a lot

The sad thing 'bout experience is

By the time you've got it

It's usually all you've got...



I'm Belle, Belle, Belle, the sleeping car

Doesn't matter who you are

Just climb aboard to lie with me

And when you wake I'll make you tea

A Pullman car when I was made

I went down for the seaside trade

I'm peeling now, the light's too bright

I wear dark glasses day and night



I had crystal lamps, Irish linen

To set off my red velvet dress

Those who rode on me compared me to

The Orient Express

That was excessive



But now they climb aboard, undress

Don't wait for me to whisper 'yes'

Don't say goodnight, just hit the lights

And worst of all turn over and go straight to sleep



Once I was a real main liner

Enjoying the occasional smoke

Now I hang around the fuel dump

Sniffing the coke

It really chokes me



Oh, Belle, Belle, Belle, the sleeping truck

I'm down at wheel, down on my luck

I may not be first class, but I'm not yet worst class

I can still warm you when the night is cold

I'm a sleeper with a heart of gold.

I can still warm you when the night is cold

I'm a sleeper with a heart of gold.
