No Comeback


Electra

Clear my track, you've had your chance now

I'll find another line, no comeback



Losing's not my style

So i can't show my face now

Find another place now

Didn't win so i'll go

Don't try to persuade me

Losing always wrecks it

This is my last exit

Stand by to fade me



No comeback, this is the last time

We'll never meet again, no comeback

No comeback, this is the last time

We'll never meet again, no comeback



No come, no come, no come, no come

No comeback, no comeback

No come, no come, no come, no come

No comeback, no comeback



Adieu mon ami, addio mia cara

Auf weidersein mein leib, sayonara

Eat my dust



No comeback, this is the last time

We'll never meet again, no comeback

No comeback, this is the last time

We'll never meet again, no comeback
