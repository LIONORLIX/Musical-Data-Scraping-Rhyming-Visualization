He Whistled at Me (Reprise)


Dinah-

I'm fed up with all this racing,

This electric thin i'm chasing,

Dosent have that certain something,

That a girl expects to hear,



He never whistles at me!

It's damaging my staus,

I dont think he can whistle at me!

He lacks the aparatus,

Why do you never whistle at me?

Beginnig to suspect you!

I need someone to whistle at me,

Gonna disconnect you,



Electra-

C.B,

C.B,

Dinah's gone and made a disconnection!

C.B,

C.B,

You gotta help me in the final section!
