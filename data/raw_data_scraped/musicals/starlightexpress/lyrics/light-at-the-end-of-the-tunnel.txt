Light at the End of the Tunnel


POPPA

Diesel is for unbelievers. Electricity is wrong.

Steam has got the power that will pull us along -

There's a light at the end of the tunnel

There's a light at the end of the tunnel

The inside might be as black as the night

ALL

But there's a light at the end of the tunnel

There's a light at the end of the tunnel

The inside might be as black as the night

But at the end of the tunnel there's a light.

POPPA

It's the power of James Watt, the steaming Scot

ALL

The man sho watched the pot and said "Hey, I've got

A brilliant plot: when the steam is hot

It seems to make a lot of power"

POPPA

It could turn a wheel ...

ALL

Lots of power ...

POPPA

It could drive it down a track ...

ALL

Clickety clack, clinkety clack...

POPPA

It could drive it with a beat ...

ALL

Choo-choo-choo...

With enough left over for a

Whoo-whoo!

He saw the light at the end of the tunnel

I said he saw the light at the end of the tunnel

POPPA

Thanks James Watt (thank you Mr Watt)

For watching the pot

ALL

He saw a light at the end of the tunnel

He saw a light at the end of the tunnel

The inside might be s black as the mnight

But at the end of the tunnel there's a light.

POPPA

There are dark days ahead

When the power goes dead.

When the oil runs dry

What can we try?

ALL

We could use the sunlight

POPPA

Bit it don't shine at night.

ALL

Nuclear fission

Leaves a nasty emission.

POPPA

Soon the pistons will be humming

Steam will have a second coming -

ALL

We saw light at the end of the tunnel

We saw light at the end of the tunnel

Just dig a hole and haul out the coal

We saw light at the end of the tunnel

We saw light at the end of the tunnel

So let the water boil - goodbye to oil

At the end of the tunnel there's a light.

We saw light at the end of the tunnel (we see the light)

We saw light at the end of the tunnel (we see the light)

When the Angel Gabriel blows his magic toot

We saw light at the end of the tunnel (we see the light)

We saw light at the end of the tunnel (we see the light)
