A Lotta Locomotion


COACHES

A lotta locomotion that's what we need

From a locomotive who can take the lead

From the eastern ocean to the western sea

Locomotion's gonna carry me

A lotta locomotion that's what we need

If we are ever gonna get up speed

A lotta locomotion and the right approach

For there are lots of different kinds of coach

ASHLEY

Like me I'm Ashley, I'm the smoking car

I've tried to knock the habit but my inside's used to tar

I know that if I don't give up I might choke or have a stroke

That scares me, and when I'm scared -

Boy I need a smoke.

BUFFY

Buffy at your service

Ever open wide

My microwave is cooking to warm you from inside

A lotta locomotion will do the trick

Come and bite my burgers

I'm hot and cheap and quick

DINAH

My name's Dinah, I'm the dining car

I'll cook for you and listen while you lean upon my bar

I'll serve you with your dinner

While the train goes loop the loop

Gee, I'm sorry gentlemen - I hope you wanted soup

COACHES

A lotta locomotion that's what we need

If we are ever gonna get up speed

From the Eastern Ocean to the Western Sea

Locomotion's gonna carry me

PEARL

My name's Pearl I'm a brand new girl

My springs still bounce my fans still whirl

Ain't gonna smoke, ain't gonna drink

COACHES

What are you gonna do ?

PEARL

What'd you think ?

COACHES

A lotta locomotion that's what we need

If we are ever gonna get up speed

From the Eastern Ocean to the Western Sea

Don't stop the piston stroking

Don't stop the fireman stoking

ASHLEY

Don't make me give up smoking

COACHES

Give up smoking ? You gotta be joking !

Locomotion's gonna carry me
