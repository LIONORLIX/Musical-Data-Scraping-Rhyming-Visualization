I Was Robbed


Rusty: I was robbed that wasn't fair.



G.B: Oh boy you lost!



Rusty: That C.B he never took of the brake!



C.B: Who me?



Rusty: That he did it for the other two's sake.



C.B: So what?



G.B.: Still don't get you anywhere.



C.B: That's how it goes.



Greaseball: Hey C.B you did that good!



C.B: Wow, Greaseball, Thanks!

Did it look like I was holding him back?



Greaseball + Electra: No way!



Electra: Looked like everything was totally slack.



C.B: Mind you.

After all these years it should.



Greaseball: No one would know.



Pearl: Hey hold on.

Don't tell me that C.B's the reason that he went so slow.



Greaseball: 'Cause it was. He had his order. So now you'll know.



Pearl: I go tell the marshalls!



Greaseball: You're in it as well. They'll only suspend you, if you ever tell.



Pearl: This wasn't how I wanted it.

This wasn't what I saw.

Each time I try it seems that I get further from my vision then before!



C.B: Ten four good buddy

Trust no one on the track!



Rusty: That's the last time I race with you.



C.B: That's right, the rerun is for just those two.

The true real engines.

Big strong engines

Call yourself an engine?

You're no engine!

Ten ? ten never again

You're no engine!

Ten ? seven got no heaven // gone to heaven

You're no engine!
