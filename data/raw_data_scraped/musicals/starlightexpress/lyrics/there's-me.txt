There's Me


All alone

You think you're on your own

You think there's no-one in the world

Who cares for you

That isn't true

There's me



I may not be

The one you want to see

But if you need someone who's kind

Then look behind

And then you'll find

There's me



I'll be near standing by

Never fear

You can cry

In a while

You will smile

And I'll be there to see



By yourself

You have to cry yourself

Nobody else can cry the tears you have to cry

But I will try

There's me



Until then

When you're okay again

You look around find that I'm no longer there

I'll still be near somewhere

You're not alone, there's me

There's always me



I'll still be near somewhere

You're not alone there's me

There's always me
