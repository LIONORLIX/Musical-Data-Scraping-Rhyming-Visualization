The Rap


Rockies:

Hey you - who, me?

Yes, you - race you!

Hey you - who, me?

Yes, you - race you!

Rusty's gonna race, Rusty's gonna race

Rusty's gonna race, Rusty's gonna race

Race in the final

Rusty's gonna race -



Greaseball:

No he ain't, no he ain't



Belle:

Who says?



Greaseball:

I say

He ain't gonna race



Belle:

But Poppa won a place, Poppa won a place

Poppa won a place, Poppa won a place

A place in the final

Poppa can't take it, he's half dead

Chosen Rusty to go instead



Belle & Rockies:

Hey you - yes you!

Rusty can race you!

Hey you - yes you!

Rusty can race you!



Dinah:

Yes, let him race you



Greaseball:

Shut it, Dinah



Dinah:

Let him race you in the final



Buffy:

Let him race, what harm can it do?



Ashley:

You know he's no match for you!



Coaches:

Let him race!



Greaseball:

No!



Electra:

No, no question

Won't even listen to your suggestion

Pearl and me will never be seen

Racing against yesterday's machine



Components:

Electra won't share a circuit with him

He needs water and coal and still wears a chimney

No style



Pearl:

Now that's not fair

What do you prove if he ain't there?



Ashley:

Right



Buffy:

Yeah



Rockies:

That's right



Greaseball:

That's true

Okay Pearl, I'm with you



Pearl:

Hey you - yes you!

Rusty can race you!



All:

Hey you - yes you!

Rusty can race you!



CB:

Must be a steamer

Poppa was a steamer

Rusty is a steamer

He has a right



Rockies:

Who'll go with him?

Can't take a heavy truck



Dustin:

Look what happened



CB:

I'll go, I'm light



Electra:

No!



Bobo:

No!



Flat top:

No!



Dustin:

Why not?

Leaving out steam trains isn't fair

Steam trains ought to have their share



Electra:

No!



Greaseball:

No!



Flat top:

No I hate steam trains

Don't look the same and have different smoke

Eat strange things, keep the rhythm going all night

Had some next door - just a joke



Poppa:

Steam will beat you

Steam will race you

Hey you - yes you!

Rusty can race you!



All:

Hey you - yes you!

Rusty can race you!



Electra:

No!



Bobo:

No! I was second

I should have won, I'm incredibly fast

Nobody beats me, everybody beats him

Where's the point?

He'll only be last



Dinah:

He has a point there



All:

Shut it, Dinah

(argue)

Will somebody listen to what I say?



Electra:

Quiet!

Yes, CB?



CB:

You ought to take on Rusty and me

If the French train runs and I'm not in it

Could go wrong at the last minute

Trust me, I'll sort it out

Tell you later what it's all about



Greaseball:

Let him race against Pearl and me

If he wants, he can have CB

You take Dinah



Electra:

That'd be good



Both:

That's how it's gonna be, understood?



Dinah:

I don't wanna



All:

Shut it, Dinah



Greaseball:

Electra, all this fuss you've made

Don't tell me you're a little bit afraid?



Components:

Electra...



Electra:

Hey, you!



Rusty:

Who, me?



Electra:

Yes, you - race you!



Electra & Components:

Hey, you - yes you

Electra's gonna race you!

Hey, you - yes you



Electra:

I'll erase you, you'll be last

The future's a duty to rub out the past



All:

Hey you, yes you, hey you, yes you

Hey you, yes you, hey you, yes you

Hey you, yes you

Rusty

Hey you, yes you

Race you - race you!
