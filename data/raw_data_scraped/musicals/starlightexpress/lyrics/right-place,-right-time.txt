Right Place, Right Time


ROCKIES

If I had the chances,

If I had the breaks

Could have been a winner

I had what it takes

But I wasn't in the right place

At the right time.

Didn't have the rhythm,

Didn't have the rhyme.

I wasn't in the right place

At the right time.

Could've been a contender,

Could've been a star.

Never reached the finals,

Didn't get that far

'Cos I wasn't in the right place

At the right time.

Didn't have the rhythm,

Didn't have the rhyme.

I wasn't in the right place

At the right time.

Any time they seem to

Open up the door,

Slam it in your face

And knock it to the floor

'Tisn't only me son,

'Tisn't only you,

All of us are losers,

All of us are through

'Cos I wasn't in the right place,

Wasn't in the right place,

Wasn't in the right place

At the right time.
