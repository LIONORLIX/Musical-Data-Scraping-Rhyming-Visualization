C.B.


Wide smile, high style, that's me

Out front, in back, C.B.

Wrong side of the track C.B.



See the news on you TV

Rail disaster

Ever wonder why was he

Getting faster

Every time the red caboose

Takes a train

Seems to loose it's braking shoes

Can't explain

(Stop that train)



Wide smile, high style, that's me

Out front, in back, C.B.

Wrong side of the track C.B.



Hiding at the back of the freight train

Unsupected

When they robbed the great train

I collected

While the feds shake their heads

I'm on the loose

There each time at the scene of the crime

The red caboose

(Stop that train)



Wide smile, high style, that's me

Out front, in back, C.B.

Wrong side of the track C.B.



The state police they don't suspect

I got old ninety seven wrecked

Interpol don't know that I

Crossed the bridge on the river Kwai

Seems like any train that takes me

Just doesn't get the brakes

Somebody go fetch a cop

Another train just failed to stop

(Brake that train)



Wide smile, high style, that's me

Out front, in back, C.B.

Wrong side of the track C.B.



Ten four Smokey bear

I could be anywhere

You know I'm to blame

But you don't know my name



Wide smile, high style, that's me

Out front, in back, C.B.

Wrong side of the track C.B.



C.B. Hanging loose

C.B. The red caboose
