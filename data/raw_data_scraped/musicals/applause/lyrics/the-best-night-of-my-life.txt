The Best Night of My Life


The best night of my life,

Is here, is now,

knowing you has got to be the greatest thing that ever happened to me



If I could freeze this moment,

and take it home with me,

I would, I would, but time goes by

And oh,

I know that I never can live this moment again, this moment again



The best night of my life,

Don't go, don't go



There's no way to say, "Thank you"

It wouldn't come out right

But, thank you for the best night of my life
