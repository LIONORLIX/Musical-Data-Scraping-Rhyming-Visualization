It Takes a Woman


Vandergelder

It takes a woman all powdered and pink

To joyously clean out the drain in the sink

And it takes an angel with long golden lashes

And soft dresden fingers

For dumping the ashes



Cornelius, Barnaby, & 2 customers

Yes it takes a woman

A dainty woman

A sweetheart, a mistress, a wife

O yes it takes a woman

A fragile woman

To bring you the sweet things in life



Vandergelder

The frail young maiden who's constantly there

For washing and blueing and shoeing the mare

And it takes a female for setting the table

And weaving the Guernsey

And cleaning the stable



All

O yes it takes a woman

A dainty woman

A sweetheart, a mistress, a wife

O yes it takes a woman

A fragile woman

To bring you the sweet things in life

And so she'll work until infinity

Three cheers for femininity

Rah Rah Rah...Rah Rah Rah

F. E. M. - I. T. Y



Vandergelder

F. E. M. I. T. Y?

Get out of here!

And in the winter she'll shovel the ice

And lovingly set out the traps for the mice

She's a joy and treasure for practically speaking

To whom can you turn when the plumbing is leaking?



Vandergelder, Cornelius, & Barnaby

To That dainty woman

That fragile woman

That sweetheart, that mistress, that wife

O yes it takes a woman



Vandergelder

A husky woman

Vandergelder, Cornelius, & Barnaby

To bring you the sweet things in life!



All

O Yes it takes a woman

A dainty woman

A sweetheart, a mistress, a wife

O yes it takes a woman, a fragile woman

To bring you the sweet things in life.
