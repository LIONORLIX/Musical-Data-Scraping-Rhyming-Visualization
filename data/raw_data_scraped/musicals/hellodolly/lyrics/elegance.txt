Elegance


Cornelius & Barnaby

Yes, New York

It's really us

Barnaby and Cornelius

Mrs. Molloy & Minnie

All the guests of Mr. Hackl are

Feelin' great and look spectacular

All

What a knack

There is to that

Acting like a born aristocrat

We got elegance

If you ain't got elegance

You can never ever carry it off

Cornelius

All who are

Well-bred agree

Minnie Fay

Has pedigree

Mrs. Molloy

Exercise your wildest whims tonight

We are out with diamond Jims tonight

Minnie

Could they be

Misleading us?

Cornelius & Barnaby

Silver spoons were used for feeding us

We got elegance

If you ain't got elegance

All

You can never ever carry it off

Middle class

Don't speak of it

Savoir Faire

We reek of it

Some were born with rags and patches but

We use dollar bills for matches and

Minnie

Vanderbilt

Kowtows to us

Cornelius

J.P. Morgan scrapes and bows to us

All

We've got elegance

We were born with elegance

Cornelius

Have you noticed when I hold my cup

The saucer never moves

Mrs. Molloy

And the way I keep my pinky up

Indubitably proves

All

That we got elegance

We got built in elegance

And with elegance...elegance...

Elegance...elegance...elegance

We'll carry it off!



We got elegance

If you ain't got elegance

You can never ever carry it off

We got Elegance...
