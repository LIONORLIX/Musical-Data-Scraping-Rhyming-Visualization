My Myopia


[George McFly]

I don't need to look around

I'll keep my focus on the ground

Hoping no one catches me

With sketches no one else can see

I don't need to have a look

Beyond the pages of this book

I want to be left alone

With the thoughts that are my own



My myopia

Is my utopia

And I'm hopin' ya

Feel it too

When you narrow your point of view

You see only what you want to

My myopia

Is my utopia

And I'm hopin' ya

Understand

That I'm doing the best I can

To see only what I want to



But deep inside

All I ever wanted to do was run and hide

And, yes I know I can do better

That's the only way I'll ever get her

And considering I haven't met her yet...



[Marty McFly]

He's a peeping tom!



[George]

I heard about this bird down under

He's terrified by the sound of thunder

He does something that I understand

He-he takes his head and buries it in the sand

Trying to avoid a confrontation

I would rather be in hibernation

I retreat to my imagination

And my reliance on- on science fiction



To land a pretty girl? Oh well, I wish

But I float just like a jellyfish

Humble pie is my favorite dish

I live in fear of- of- of contradictions



My myopia

Is my utopia

And I'm hopin' ya feelin' it

See how I'm dealin' with it

And...I'm...hopin' you're feelin' it too...

Oh...
