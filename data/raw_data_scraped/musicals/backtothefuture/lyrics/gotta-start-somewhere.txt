Gotta Start Somewhere


[Goldie Wilson]

Mayor Goldie Wilson... I like the sound of that!



What are you waitin' for?

Pick yourself up?from?the floor

If you?don't respect yourself

You won't get it?from no one else

No shame in workin' hard

Let them know that's who you are

Though I'm no man in the room

I'm still the best one with this broom

This ain't no step and fetch it

It's all part of the climb

There's a train, I'm gonna catch it

It's a matter of time



But you gotta start somewhere

You gotta start somewhere

You gotta get going or you're never gonna get there

And once you g?t movin'

You'll find some way somehow

And it might as well b? right here right now

Come on boy!

You gotta start somewhere



Listen up, sometimes you gotta sweep that negativity right outta the way!



[Ensemble]

Yeah!



[Goldie, Goldie and Ensemble]

Some people's road to fame

Begin on streets that have no name

It doesn't have to hold ya back

Once you're movin' on that track

Don't be confined to it

If you put your mind to it

You can always get your way

If you're willin' just to sweat your way

Don't give me the medial

Do the best you can

Remain congenial

And someday you'll be the man!



[Goldie, (Ensemble), Both]

But you gotta start somewhere

(Gotta start somewhere)

You gotta start somewhere

(Gotta start somewhere)

And make yourself useful

Or you're never gonna get there

(Never gonna get there)

Once you get movin'

You'll find some way somehow

And it might as well be right here right now

Come on boy!

You gotta start somewhere

(Gotta start somewhere)

You gotta start somewhere

(Gotta start somewhere)

You gotta get goin' (You're never)

Or you're never gonna get there

(Never gonna get there)

Once you get movin'

You'll find some way somehow

And it might as well be right here, right now!

Come on boy!



{Instrumental break}



[Goldie]

Keep moving and a-groovin'

It's honest state of mind

As long as you're improvin'

You won't feel left behind



[Goldie, (Ensemble), Both]

But you gotta start somewhere

(You gotta start somewhere)

You gotta start somewhere

(You gotta start somewhere)

Movin' or you'll

(Never, never, never, no)

Never get there (Yeah!)

Once you get movin'

You'll find some way somehow

(You'll find some way somehow)

And it might as well be right here right now

(Come on, come on boy!)

Might as well be right here

(You gotta start somewhere)

You gotta start somewhere

(You gotta start right now)

(You gotta start somewhere)

You gotta start somewhere

(You gotta start right now)

(And you'll be the man!)

Heeee-yeaaah!

You'll be the man!
