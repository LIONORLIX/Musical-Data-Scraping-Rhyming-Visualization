Earth Angel (Will You Be Mine)


[Intro: Marvin Berry]

This goes out to all you lovers tonight



[Marvin, (Mark Dixon), Lorraine Baines, George McFly]

Earth angel, Earth angel, will you be mine?

My darling dear, love you all the time

I'm just a fool, a fool in love with you



Aren't you gonna kiss me, George?

Oh, gee, I dunno, I, uh...



Earth angel, Earth angel, the one I adore (Scram, McFly, I'm cuttin' in!)

Love you for ever, and ever more...



{Music gets grittier and more shrill}

(C'mon, Lorraine, let's dance.)

Hey, stop it! No! George!

(Hey, what are you doin'? Hey, place your arms around me!)

Leave m? alone! Stop it! George!

(Com? on, Lorraine! Quit bein' such a square, huh?)

Stop it! Let me go!

(Hey, come on, let's dance with me!)

Excuse me!



{Climaxing musical interlude}



[Marvin, (Backing vocals), Marvin and backing vocals, George, George and Lorraine]

The vision of your happiness, wo-o-o-o-o-oah...

Earth angel, Earth angel

Please be mine (Ooo-oo-oo-ooh)

My darling dear, (My darling)

Love you all the time (I love you...)



I'm just a fool (A-a-a-ah...)

A fool in love...

With you...

(Ah, a-a-a-a-ah...)
