Something About That Boy


[Lorraine Baines, (Backing Chorus), Lorraine and Backing Chorus]

A man should be strong

A man should be true

A man can be handsome but he's gotta come through

He's gotta have manners, but not too polite

There's nothing more boring than someone too tight

He's got everything I'm looking for

He's got something different

He's got more of that extra special "la-dee-da"

What the French call: "Je ne sais quoi"



There's something about that boy

There's something about that boy

He's bringing me so much joy

I don't know what it is but those eyes of his look through me

He's got everything that a girl could need

He's not like the others; he's so sweet

And there's almost nothing I wouldn't do (nothing she wouldn't do...)

To make sure that his dreams come true... (woah...)



(There's something about that boy)

I know I just met him...

(There's something about that boy)

But I have to get him...

(He's bringing me so much joy)

And I just can't forget him; I'm ready to let him know now... (ooh...)

How special we could be

He's such a mystery (woooah...)

We could make history, 'cause there's something about (ooh...)

(Something about)

Something about...

(Something about...)

Something about that boy!



[Biff Howard Tannen, 3D (Goon #1), Slick (Goon#2), (3D & Slick), Biff and gang]

There's somethin' about that boy (about that boy)

That I don't like;

It's just not right (He's just not right)

There's somethin' that I'll destroy

He's gonna pay;

It starts today!!!



There's somethin' about that punk

A no good crumb!

A first-class bum! Yeah!

There's somethin' that just ain't right!

He's on some list

Like he's a communist!



I'm gonna find him

And when I do... (and when you do...)

I'm gonna unwind him

And break him right in three! (Two...)

Get him!



{Musical Interlude}



[Lorraine, (Backing Chorus), Biff Tannen, {3D and Slick}, Biff and gang, [Lorraine and Biff], All]

(There's something about that boy)

I can't put my finger on it

(There's something about that boy)

I just wanna linger on it...

(He's bringing me so much joy)

And there's something about that, something about that boy!

I'm gonna find him; He supplied everything that I need...

And when I do {and when you do}; He's turned up the heat inside me...

I'm gonna unwind him! {And break him!}

[And I just can't forget him; I'm ready to let him know now...]



(There's something about that boy)

He'll be destroyed!; I know I just met him...

(There's something about that boy)

He'll be destroyed!; But I have to get him...

(He's bringing me so much joy!)

Something about that...



[Lorraine, Girl 1, Girl 2, (Backing Chorus), [Biff], Lorraine and Backing Chorus]

Something about that boy!

(There's something about that boy)

(There's something about that boy)

About that boy!

(There's something about that boy)



Oh, you weren't kidding, Lorraine!

Where did he come from?

Where does he live?

I don't know but I'm gonna find out... Calvin Klein, I'm gonna make you mine! (Something about that...)

[Somethin' about that...]

Something about that boy!
