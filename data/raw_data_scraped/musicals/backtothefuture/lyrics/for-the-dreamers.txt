For the Dreamers


[1955 Doc Brown]

So this one's for the dreamers

Whoever tried to make it

Though very few ever break through

We celebrate them when they do

Lionise them, call them great

Ticker-tape parade them

But this one's for the dreamers

Who strive to be a winner

Go as far as they can take it

Even if they don't quite make it...

This one's for the dreamers



Let's hear it for the dreamers

Who never stop believing

One grain of sand becomes a pearl

A great idea can change the world

They can see what others don't;

Try things others won't

So this one's for the dreamers

Who live on inspiration

Go as far as they can take it

Even if they don't quite make it...

This one's for the dreamers



And I know what it's like to be misunderstood

And I know how it feels to be told you're no good

But I couldn't give up; no, I never would

But people just took advantage of me

My distractions just consumed me

But for everyone that gets it right

Thousands more keep up the fight

They burn the fires deep in the night until they lose the light!

And most just disappear and we never hear of them...



So this one's for the dreamers

Who have the guts to risk it

To take a chance on what they think;

Can't stare them down 'cause they don't blink

Ridicule or call them out;

No one sees what they're about

Yes, this one's for the dreamers

Whose names we don't remember

They were close but no cigar

And we don't know who they are...

This one's for the dreamers

This one's for the dreamers

Like me...
