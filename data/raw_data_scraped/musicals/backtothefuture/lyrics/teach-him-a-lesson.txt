Teach Him a Lesson


[Intro: Biff Howard Tannen, 3D (Goon #1), Slick (Goon#2)]

You hear that guys? "Calvin Klein's goin' to the sissy dance on Saturday"! Well, we wouldn't be caught dead, at a thing like that, would we guys?!

No...! Yes...!

There's somethin' about that punk

That I don't trust

He's dangerous

There's somethin' that don't add up

Arithmetic

And a hockey stick

There's somethin' about that guy

Since he appeared!

It's really weird!

Yeah

There's somethin' that's all messed up

It don't make sense how he's dressed up!



I'm gonna find him

And wh?n I do (And when you do...)

I'm gonna remind him

Of what a man can't do!



I'm gonna

Teach him a l?sson

That he'll always forget! ("Never forget"!)

Teach him for messin' with

A man he won't regret... ("Man he will regret"!)

Yes, I'm the man he won't regret! ("Will regret"!)



Teach him a lesson

That I haven't learnt yet

Teach him for messin' with

A man he will forget... ("Man he won't"!)

Yes, I'm the man

(You're the man)

I'm the man

(You're the man)

I'm the man!

(He'll be destroyed!)



There's somethin' about that boy

It's heads, he wins

And tails, I lose!

There's somethin' that I'll/(he'll) destroy

I'll pay his dues!

I'll shine his shoes!



SATURDAY NIGHT!!! (*laughs evilly*)
