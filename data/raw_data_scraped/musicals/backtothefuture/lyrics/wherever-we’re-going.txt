Wherever Weâ€™re Going


[Intro: Jennifer Parker, Marty McFly]

Marty! I just heard about your audition. I am so sorry. Strickland is such a jerk!

Hey, what if he's right, Jennifer? What if I'm just not cut out for music? What if I never get a chance to play for an audience?

Oh come on. One rejection is not the end of the world. And you're good Marty, you're really, really good

What if today was a sign? I just don't think I can take anymore rejection...

Gee... I'm starting to sound like my old man...



[Verse 1: Jennifer]

Why do you let people put you down?

It's not for them to say

Just keep your feet planted on the ground

And look the other way



They'll define you

Unless have a dream

You gotta tak? time to

Be what you can be

And l?t me remind you

You're everything to me

Something good is flowing...



[Chorus 1: Jennifer]

Wherever we're going is alright with me

There's no way of knowing; we'll just wait and see

We'll get where we're going eventually

Wherever we're going is alright, alright, alright, alright with me



[Verse 2: Jennifer]

I know you better than anyone

And you belong to me

And we will finish what we've begun

You'll write a song for me



I can hear it

When you sing to me

I wanna be near it

It's you I wanna see

Let me be clear that

You're everything to me

Something good is flowing...



[Chorus 2: Jennifer, Marty, Both]

Wherever we're going is alright with me

I'm lovin' just knowing you're going with me

A future together is our destiny

Wherever we're goin' is alright, alright

It's alright



[Outro: Jennifer, Marty, Both]

Wherever we're goin' we're both gonna see

Our story unfoldin' (our story)

A great mystery

I know in my heart that we're holdin' the key

Wherever we're going (Wherever)

Is alright, alright, (It's alright, alright)

It's alright, it's alright (Alright)

It's alright

It's alright with me
