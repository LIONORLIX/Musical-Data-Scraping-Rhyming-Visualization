The Power of Love


[Intro: George McFly]

My success...is the result of some very simple advice a young man gave to me 30 years ago: "You can accomplish anything if you put your mind to it.", and here's the proof. May I introduce our son, Marty McFly, and his band, the Pinheads!



[Verse 1: Marty McFly]

The power of love is a curious thing

Make-a one man weep, make another man sing

Change a hawk to a little white dove

More than a feeling, that's the power of love



Tougher than diamonds, rich like cream

Stronger and harder than a bad girl's dream

Make a bad one good, make a wrong one right

Power of love will keep you home at night



[Chorus 1: Marty, Marty and Jennifer Parker]

You don't need money, don't take fame

Don't need no credit card to ride this train

It's strong and it's sudden and it's cruel sometimes

But it might just save your life

That's the power of love

That's the power of love



[Verse 2: Mayor Goldie Wilson, Marty and Goldie, Marty]

First time you feel it, it might make you sad

Next time you feel it, it might make you mad

But you'll be glad, baby, when you've found

That's the power

That makes the world go round



[Chorus 2: Company]

You don't need money, don't take fame

Don't need no credit card to ride this train

It's strong and it's sudden and it'll be cruel sometimes

But it might just save your life



[Bridge: Marty, (backing vocals)]

They say that all in love is fair

Yeah, but you don't care

But you know what to do (oo-oo what to do...)

When it gets hold of you (ooooh...)

And with a little help from above (Ohhhhh...)

You feel the power of love

Can you feel it?



[Chorus: Marty, Marty and Company, (Backing Chorus)]

You don't need money, you don't take fame

Don't need no credit card to ride this train

Tougher than diamonds and stronger than steel

You won't feel nothin' till you feel

Feel the power, just the power of love (woooaah...)

That's the power, that's the power of love

You feel the power of love

You feel the power of love

You feel the power of love
