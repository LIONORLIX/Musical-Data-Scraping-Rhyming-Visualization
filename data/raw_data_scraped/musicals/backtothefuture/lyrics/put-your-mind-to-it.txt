Put Your Mind to It


[Intro: George McFly, Marty McFly]

You make it sound so easy... I-I just wish I wasn't so scared...

Scared? George! Buddy, there's nothing to be scared about! Just remember...



[Verse 1: Marty]

When you walk

Take it slow

Like you're goin' someplace only you can go

And when you talk

Don't be loud

Friends are fine but don't be part of a crowd

And don't be in a hurry

Even when you're runnin' late

You should never worry

George, you've gotta concentrate!



[Chorus: Marty and Backing Chorus]

Put your mind to it

Don't be blind to it

And we can fine tune it

Just put your mind to it

Your mind...



[Interlude: George, Marty]

I feel I was doing exactly what you were doing...

Ah...not even close

Errr...

Alright, George, now let's try again



[Verse 2: Marty, George, (Backing Chorus)]

When you play

Have some fun

Make it look like you have already won

And when you dance

On the bones

Try to swagger like Mick Jagger of the Stones

Wait, wait, what stones? And who's "Dick" Jagger?



Stop apologisin'

Be anythin' you want to be

(Anything you wanna be, anythin' that you wanna be)

No over-analysin'

Let that man inside go free



[Chorus: Marty and Backing Chorus]

Put your mind to it

Don't be blind to it

And we can fine tune it

Just put your mind to it

Your mind...



[Bridge: Marty, (Backing Chorus)]

It's a state of mind (State of mind)

It's a point of view (Point of view)

If you want that girl (Want that girl)

Make up your mind to...

[Instrumental break: Marty, George]

Hey, you're doing it! Let's go! Hey, you feelin' it yet, George?

Yeah, right in my neck!



[Outro: All, George]

(P-P-P-P-P) Put your mind to it

Don't be blind to it

Draw a line through it

Just put your mind to it (Put your, Put your, P-P-P)

Just put your mind to it!

And your behind to it!

Don't be confined to it!

Just put your mind to it!

My mind...
