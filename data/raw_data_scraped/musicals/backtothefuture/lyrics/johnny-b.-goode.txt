Johnny B. Goode


[Intro: Marty McFly]

Okay, ah, so, uh, this one's an oldie... Well, it's an oldie where I come from. Okay, so this is a blues riff in B flat. Watch me for the changes, and, um... yeah, try to keep up, okay?



[Instrumental introduction]



[Verse 1: Marty]

Way down in Louisiana, close to New Orleans

Way back up in the woods, among the evergreens

There stood a log cabin made of earth and wood

Where lived a country boy named-a Johnny B. Goode

Who never ever learned to read or write so well

But he could play the guitar like he's ringing a bell



[Chorus: Marty]

Go, go

Go, Johnny, go, go

Go, Johnny, go, go

Go, Johnny, go, go

Go, Johnny, go, go, go

Johnny B. Goode



[Verse 2: Marty]

His mama told him, "Someday, you will be a man

And you will be the leader of a big ol' band

Now, many people coming from-a miles around

To hear you playing music when the sun come down

Maybe someday your name will be in light

Saying "Johnny B. Goode tonight!""



[Chorus: Marty and Prom Attendees]

Go, go! (Go, go,)

Go, Johnny, go, go

Go, Johnny, go, go

Go, Johnny, go, go

Go, Johnny, go, go, go

Johnny B. Goode!



[Instrumental break accompanied by Marty's rock guitar solo. Said solo starts becoming too audacious and eventually ends]



[Outro: Marty]

Guess you guys aren't ready for that yet... but your kids are gonna love it...
