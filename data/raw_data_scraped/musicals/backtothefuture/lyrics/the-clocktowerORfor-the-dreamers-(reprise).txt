The Clocktower/For the Dreamers (Reprise)


{Instrumental}



[1955 Doc Brown]

One grain of sand

Becomes a pearl

One small step

Can change the world

They can see what others don't

Try things others won't

So this one's for the dreamers...

This one's for the dreamers...

This one's for the dreamers...

Like... meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!



{Instrumental}
