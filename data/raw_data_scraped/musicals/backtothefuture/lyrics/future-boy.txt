Future Boy


[Intro: Marty McFly, 1955 Doc Brown]

It's a small matter of power, Doc. Uh, we need 1.21 gigawatts

1.21 gigawatts... 1.21 gigawatts? How are you gonna generate that much juice?! I'm afraid you're stuck here!

Stuck here?!? Argh! I cannot be stuck here! I got a life in 1985! I got a family! I got a girl!

Is she pretty?

Doc, she's everything to me... please, pleasepleaseplease, you are my only hope... You've never let me down in the past...

You mean in the future?

Hey, and you've always said: "You can accomplish anything if you just put your mind to it."

I said that? That's good advice, but I just don't know how to generate that kind of power, future boy!



[Marty]

Future boy

I'm no future boy

'Cause I think I'm here to stay

What's the future for

If I don't get more than today?

I'm no future boy



I'll never find what I left behind

There's nothing for me here

There's only more of what came before

My future disappeared

Now everything's uncertain

Can't see behind the curtain

I can't go and I don't know

Where this all will lead...



[Interlude: Doc Brown, Marty]

Marty, there is one energy source capable of generating 1.21 gigawatts of electricity: it's a bolt... of lightning!

What did you say?

A bolt... of lightning! Unfortunately, you never know when or where it's ever gonna strike!

We do now

This is it! It says here that the bolt of lightning is going to strike the clocktower at exactly 10:04PM, next Saturday night!



[Doc Brown]

The physics of this problem are perplexing

The muscles in my brain are busy flexing

As a geometric form

Of a pending thunderstorm

Is hard to calculate

But now we have a date

And all my computations must conform!



Eh... if we can somehow harness this lightning, channel it into the Flux Capacitor...

The way to get you back takes an equation

And a meteorological occasion

And then a lightning crack

Becomes a power pack

That's what it's gonna take;

No room for a mistake!

It's the only way to ever get you back!



[Backing Chorus (in rounds)]

The only way to ever get you back!

[Doc Brown, Doc & Backing Chorus, (Backing Chorus), Marty, Marty & Backing Chorus]

Back to the future, boy!

You're the future boy!

And we know we found a way!

Ah, you're the future boy

And it's gonna be okay!

(Ah-ah-ah, Ah-ah-ah...)

I'm the future boy!

(He'll find a way! He'll find a way! He'll find a way! He'll find a waaaaaa-aaaaaay!)

I'm the future boy!
