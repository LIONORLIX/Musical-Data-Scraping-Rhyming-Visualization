21st Century


[1955 Doc Brown, (Backing Chorus), Both]

No more hunger, no more pain; they're things of the past

Peace and love is all we'll ever know

With no more work or money we'll be happy at last

The sun will follow everywhere we go

(There's no more crime in the future

Just summertime in the future

We're out of time 'cause the future's now...)



I got myself a time machine

Imagine what we'll see

In the 21st century!



Flying cars and strange machines will fill up the sky

Trips to Mars will happen everyday

Exercising while you're sleeping; give it a try

Watch TV while inches fall away

(There's no more flair in the future

You'll have great hair in the future

Time to prepare 'cause the future's now...)



I like the way this baby feels

I can't wait to be

In the 21st Century!

So many things I need to share

I get to prove them everywhere

Experimentally

In the 21st century!



The new world will be shiny and bright (Ah-ah-ah)

It will be a delight (Oh-oh-oh-oh)

Everything bakelite

And since we've given up cash (Ah-ah-ah)

No more markets will crash (Oh-oh-oh-oh)

And we'll vaporize trash

Just imagine playing all day (Ah-ah-ah)

And with double the pay; (Oh-oh-oh-oh)

Wouldn't that be okay?

It's like the new kingdom come (It's like the new kingdom!)

And it's nothin' but fun

The new millennium!



(He's got star power)

I got myself a time machine (Meteor shower)

Imagine what we'll see (And it's his hour!)

In the 21st century!

Just think of what we're gonna find! (Here, let's fine tune it)

A world that's gonna blow your mind! (Put his mind to it)

Imagine what will be (And as time prove it)

In the 21st century!



{Instrumental break}



[Doc Brown, (Backing Chorus), Both]

I got myself a time machine; (It's a miracle)

I need to keep it really clean! (Astro-lyrical)

Beyond this galaxy (It's a miracle)

In the 21st century!

I really dig this stainless steel (He'll go far and wide)

It feels so good behind the wheel! (He'll history write)

I can't wait to be (In the coolest night)

In the 21st century!

I can't wait to be...

In the 21st century!
