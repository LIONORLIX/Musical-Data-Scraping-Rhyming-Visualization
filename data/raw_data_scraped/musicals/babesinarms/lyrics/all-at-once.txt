All At Once


Val:

You're the most beautiful baby,

in your mother's eyes and mine,

and any other mother's child,

is too divine



Susie:

You're such a sensible fellow,

it's ashame you have no sense,

if you think i'm still a baby then,

you must

be

dense



All at once,

baby starts in toddling,

and all at once,

baby needs no coddling,

and soon,

knows all the names,

of toys and games,

discovers bliss in, kissin'



all at once,

baby need direction,

to fall at once,

in the right direction,

if you were wise,

or had eyes,

you'd be able to see,

all at once,

baby's gonna love me



Val:

all at once,

baby need direction,

to fall at once,

in the right direction,



Susie:

if you were wise,

or had eyes,

you'd be able to see



Val & Susie:

all at once,

baby's gonna love me
