I Wish I Were In Love Again


VERSE



You don't know that I felt good

when we up and parted.

You don't know I knocked on wood

gladly broken-hearted.

Worrying is trought,

I sleep all night

appetite and health restored.

You don't know how muck I'm bored!



REFRAIN 1



The sleepless nights,

the daily fights

the qick toboggan when you reach the heights

I miss the kisses and I miss the bites

I wish I were in love again!



The broken dates,

the endless waits,

the lovely loving and the hateful hates,

the conversations with the flying plates

I wish I were in love again!



No more pain

no more strain

now I'm sane but ...

I would rather be gaga!

The pulled-out fur

of cat and cur

the fine mismating of a him and her

I've learned my lesson, but I wish I were

in love again!



REFRAIN 2

The furtive sight

the blackened eye,

the words "I'll love you till the day I day"

the self-deception the belives the lie

I wish I were in love again!



When love congeals

it soon reveals

the faint aroma of performing seals

the double-crossong ps a pair of heels.

I wish I were in love again!



No more care

no despair

I'm all there now

But I'd rather be punch-drunk!

Belive me sir

I much prefer

the classic battle of a him and her.

I don't like quiet and

I wish I were in love again!
