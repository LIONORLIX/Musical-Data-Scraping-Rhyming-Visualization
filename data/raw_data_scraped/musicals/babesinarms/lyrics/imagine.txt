Imagine


Imagine your bills are payed,

Imagine you've made the grade with no dishes in the sink all you do is drink clarine lemmonade.

Imagine you own a car a trailer that has a bar your clothes fit you like a glove tellin what a love you are.

Your such a lucky kid folks boast of what ya did no wonder Mr. Baldwin made a bid.

Imagine your out of debt and love brings you no regret if you cant imagine this then you be nuts my pet.

Your broadway's britest star lights light up were you are your much a bigger star than even Maraline.

Imagine at 17 your queen of the silver screen if you cant imagine this then you must be nuts my pet.
