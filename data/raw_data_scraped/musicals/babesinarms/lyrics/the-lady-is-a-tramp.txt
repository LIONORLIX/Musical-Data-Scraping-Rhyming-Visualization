The Lady Is A Tramp


I get too hungry for dinner at eight

I like the theatre but never come late

I never bother with people I hate

That's why the lady is a tramp



I don't like crapgames with Barons and Earls

Won't go to Harlem in ermine and pearls

Won't dish the dirt with the rest of the girls

That's why the lady is a tramp



I like the free fresh wind in my hair

Life without care

I'm broke, it's oke



Hates california is cold and is damp

That's why the lady is a tramp
