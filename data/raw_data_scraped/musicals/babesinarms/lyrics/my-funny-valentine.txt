My Funny Valentine


Be hold the way our fine feathered-friend

his virtue doth parade.

Thou knowest not my dim witted friend,

the picture Thou hast made.

Thy vacant brow and Thy tousled hair

conceal Thy good intent.

Thou noble upright, truthful, sincere

And slightly dopey gent- you are..



My funny valentine

Sweet comic valentine

You make me smile with my heart



You looks are laughable, unphotographable

Yet you're my favorite work of art



Is your figure less than greek

Is your mouth a little bit weak

When you open it to speak, are you smart?



Don't change your hair for me

Not if you care for me

Stay little valentine stay



Each day is valentine's day
