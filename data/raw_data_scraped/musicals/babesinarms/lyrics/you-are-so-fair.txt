You Are So Fair


You're a siren if there ever was one-

And there was one.

You're a Lorelei,

I'm a dope.

You're a baddie if I ever saw one-

And I've seen one.

Darling, you're a lie;

I've no hope.

I'm at the end of my rope.



REFRAIN 1



You are so fair-

Like an Oriental vision,

But you won't make that decision.

You're not quite fair.

I'd pay vour fare

To Niagara Falls and back too,

But you never will react to

This love affair.

You are the crepes suzette

I should get

On my bill of fare,

But if you love me not,

Flower pot,

See if I care.

See how you'll fare

If you keep on playing Rover.

When I come to think it over,

You're only fair.



REFRAIN 2



You are so fair

But you know you' re no Apollo

And to say you're hard to swallow

Is only fair.

I'd pay your fare

All around the world and back too,

For I'd like to give the sack to

This love affair.

You are the Camembert

I can't bear

On my bill of fare,

So if you love me not,

Flower pot,

See if I care.

See how you'll fare

If you keep on playing Rover.

When I come to think it over,

You're only fair.



REFRAIN 3

Your hair ain't fair

And you got no style in dressing.

I'm afraid you ain't possessing

No savoir-faire.

I'd pay your fare

To the tropic of New Guinea,

For I'd like to yell "C'est finis"

To this affair.

You are the freak event

In the tent

Of a county fair;

So if you love me not,

Polka dot,

See if I care.

See how you'll fare

If you keep on playing Rover.

When I come to think it over,

You're only fair.
