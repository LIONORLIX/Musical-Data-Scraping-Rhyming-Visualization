Where Or When


VERSE

Sometimes you think you've lived before

All that you live today

Things you do come back to you

As though they knew the way

Oh, the tricks your mind can play!



REFRAIN

It seem we stood and talked like this before

we looked at each other in the same way then,

But I can?t remenber where or when.

The clothes you?re wearing are the clothes you wore.

The smile you are smiling you were smilimg then,

But I can?t remember where or when.



Some things that happend for the first time,

Seem to be happenig again.

Amd so it seems that we have met before

and laughted before

and loved before,

But who knows where or when.
