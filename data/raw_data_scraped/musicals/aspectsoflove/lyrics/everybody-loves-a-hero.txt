Everybody Loves A Hero


RIFLE-RANGE BARKER

Who's feeling lucky?

Twenty out of twenty

And a prize could be yours!



FREAK-SHOW BARKER

See "Marie the Monkey"

With the poisonous claws!



RIFLE-RANGE BARKER

There's a prize

To be won!



FREAK-SHOW BARKER

Take a risk,

Take a ride!



RIFLE-RANGE BARKER

Right this way,

Have a go!



FREAK-SHOW BARKER

Try your luck,

And step inside!



CHORUS

If you reach

For the moon,

If you aim

For the sky,

Then the moon

And the sky

Can be yours --

Come on and try!



Everybody loves a hero!

Let's hear it for the man with the gun!

Everybody loves a hero...
