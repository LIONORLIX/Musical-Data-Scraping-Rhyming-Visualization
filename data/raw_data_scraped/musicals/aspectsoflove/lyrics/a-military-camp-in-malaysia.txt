A Military Camp in Malaysia

"News takes time to reach us here.

So you're married.

How time flies.

And George will be a father soon.

That was more of a surprise.

Perhaps one day we'll meet again,

If I ever leave the army..."



Live or perish

In its flame,

Love will never,

Never let you

Be the same...



Love will never,

Never let you

Be the same!
