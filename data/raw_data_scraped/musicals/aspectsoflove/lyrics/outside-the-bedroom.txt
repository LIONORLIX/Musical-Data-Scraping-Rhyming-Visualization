Outside the Bedroom


ROSE (offstage)

What was that?



ALEX (offstage)

What?



ROSE

There.

Listen.

It's her ghost.

I'm frightened.



ALEX (himself a little scared)

Don't be silly.  I'll go and have a look.



ROSE (from inside)

Well?



ALEX (covering his misgivings)

There's nothing there.  I suppose it must have been a rat.



ROSE

I can't sleep in a house full of rats!



ALEX (following)

Well, I don't want you to sleep just yet...



ROSE

Alex.  Not now.



ALEX

Rose, where are you?

Rose, where are you?



ROSE

I've been out walking.

And what a day --

So crisp and clear!

And you're not spending it in here!



Let's breathe some mountain air!



ALEX

I thought you'd left me...



ROSE (continuing on her own line of thought)

What do you say?



ALEX

I had a dream you'd left me...



ROSE

Good idea?



ALEX (coming to)

Good idea!
