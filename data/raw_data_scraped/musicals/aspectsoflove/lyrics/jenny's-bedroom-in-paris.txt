Jenny's Bedroom in Paris


ALEX

Come on, Jenny.

That's enough now.

Jenny, even mermaids

Have to sleep.



JENNY

I am a mermaid

With golden hair...



ALEX

Come on, Jenny.

Be a good girl.



JENNY (suddenly serious)

Alex, let me hold you...

There's so much I want to say...



I want you here forever,

In my arms and in my life,

To belong to you entirely...

You know we're not just cousins...



ALEX (getting up)

We are just cousins, Jenny,

And you're fifteen years old.



JENNY (pulling him back)

It's not as if I don't know passion

From living in our house...

I've learnt that feelings can run deep...



ALEX

We'll talk tomorrow --

Go to sleep.



Taking more...

Than I ought to take...



What are you doing?

Don't even think it...

You have no right to feel this way,

And yet...

I love her, and I must not love her...

I wish to God we'd never met...

She ought to be

The last one I should think of...



GEORGE

I know he's

Up there with her now...



ALEX

She ought to be

The last one I should love...



GEORGE

If he is,

My God, I'll kill him...



ALEX

She ought to be

The last one I should care for...



GEORGE

I should have

Stopped this long ago...



ALEX

The very last...



GEORGE

Selfish little cradle-snatcher...

Twisted, rotten, heartless monster...

Filthy, filthy callous bastard...



I was right...

He's in there...

There he is...

He's in there...



Jenny, my Jenny,

I can't let him take you,

I...



ALEX

George...George...



ALEX

I was saying goodnight to Jenny,

When I heard a noise in the passage...



He must have fallen

And had a heart attack.



HUGO (to ROSE who is bending down to attempt to revive GEORGE)

No, it's hopeless...



ROSE

He was listening --

Jenny mustn't know.

If she asks you,

Say he died while sitting by the fire --

Help me to move him in there.
