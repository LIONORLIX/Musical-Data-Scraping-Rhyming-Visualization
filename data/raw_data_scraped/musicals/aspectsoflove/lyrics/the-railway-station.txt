ALEX (pacing, finally exploding)

That girl can really act!

I could have sworn that she'd be here!

She's got a great career --

She should play Salom?!

Maybe I was mad,

But she really seemed sincere...



ROSE

Please say you're not angry,

I just couldn't bear it!

Please say you forgive me --

I want you to swear it!



ALEX

Of course I'm not angry --

I knew that you'd make it.

There's plenty of time...



Here, that's heavy -- I'll take it.



ROSE

I feel seventeen again!



ALEX

So do I...
