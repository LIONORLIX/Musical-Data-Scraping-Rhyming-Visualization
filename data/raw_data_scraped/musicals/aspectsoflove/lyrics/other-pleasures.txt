Other Pleasures


GEORGE:

Other pleasures...

And I've known many...

Afternoons

In warm Venetian squares,

Brief encounters,

Long siestas...

Pleasures old and new

Can't compare with you.



You amaze me!

Where did you come from?

You do things

Champagne could never do.

Crystal winters,

Crimson summers...

Other pleasures --

I would trade them all

For you.



Pleasures old and new

Can't compare with you...



Wild mimosa...

The scent of evening...

Shuttered rooms

With sunlight breaking through...

Crazy soir?es...

Lazy Sundays...

Other pleasures...

I would trade them all

For you.



Sailing off

In the night

On a silver lake...

Taking more

From this life

Than I ought to take...

Other pleasures...

I would trade them all

For you.



JENNY

Quickly!

She's here now!

Don't be an old lazybones!



GEORGE (coming to and looking at his watch)

Good Lord!

The time!

For once she's managed

To arrive ahead of schedule!



ROSE (to JENNY, producing a gift-wrapped present)

Wait till you see

What I've got for you,

Darling.



And wait till you see

What I've got for you...



ALEX

I don't believe this...



ROSE (echoing him)

I don't believe this...



GEORGE (struggling with his emotions)

Good God, I wondered what had happened to you!

Rose, you really should have let me know!



Dear boy, you must meet Jenny!



ALEX

Hello, cousin.

Nice to meet you.



JENNY

So you're the soldier?



ROSE

This is Alex.

You remember.



JENNY

Yes, of course.



ROSE (to GEORGE)

He saw my last performance.



ALEX

She really was phenomenal.



JENNY

"A truly blazing star"!



GEORGE, JENNY, & ALEX

Rose, you're a wonder!



GEORGE

All the dreams we've worked for

Have come true
