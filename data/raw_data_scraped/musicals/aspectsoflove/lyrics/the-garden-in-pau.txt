The garden in Pau


GEORGE (to ALEX)

I trust you're staying for the vintage?



JENNY (to GEORGE)

Oh, he mustn't miss it!



ROSE

Alex, promise me you won't run off just yet!



JENNY

There's lots of room!



ALEX (shrugs and smiles)

I'm in no hurry --

If it won't worry you...

This could be something you'll regret!



ROSE

Oh, no!

That's really disappointing!



GEORGE

What on earth's the matter?



ROSE

Giulietta won't be with us this weekend.



GEORGE

What's happened now?



ROSE

Same situation.



GEORGE

That girl's relationships

Are too involved to comprehend!



ALEX

Looks like I'll never meet your friend.



GEORGE (rising)

One day you will, old chap.



It's time I took my nap.



Good Lord, the time has really flown!



ROSE

I'd better run along.

You'll have to manage on your own!



ALEX (to himself)

Part of me was always in these hills...

This is where my eyes were opened...

When life was young and we had time...

I wonder why she brought me back here...

Why invite me?

Why entice me?

Why rekindle old emotions...?
