The Garden at Pau


JENNY

Say the word!

Say it now!

Nice and loud!



ALEX (defeated)

What the hell, then --

Uncle!



Jenny you're a monster!

You ought to be locked up!



JENNY (going into the house)

Before I am,

I think I'll dress for dinner --

You mix the drinks...



ALEX (looking after JENNY)

She needs a Paris education.

I've told you time and time again.



ROSE

And wouldn't that be cozy?

You could then have your very own Parisienne!



Alex, how can you even think

Of moving her away from this place?

I mean, Alex, you of all people have found

That leaving here is hard to face.



ALEX

Yes, I love it here and always will...

But Rose, it's not the views

Or the vines that keep me here...

I stay year after year

For something far deeper...

Being in this house

Makes the past seem very near...



BOTH

...When the world was a playground

All train-rides and laughter,

And love in the morning...



ROSE

...And armagnac after...



ALEX

Since leaving the army

And being around you,

I know I'm reliving

The night that I found you...



ROSE

But George...

I couldn't hurt George...

Oh Alex, you know by now

How much I love him...



ALEX

So what is it

You feel for Hugo?



ROSE

Please understand I'm not in love with him.

He's a friend, he makes me laugh...

That's all it is.

Alex, can't you see

That you mean much more to me?



Alex, that's why I won't

Play the lover with you.

What I did to you once

Wasn't easy to do --

But I only have one life,

Not two...
