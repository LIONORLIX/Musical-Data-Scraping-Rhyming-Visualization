Falling


ALEX:

Love, and your

World can become

A madhouse.

Love and your

World can become

A circus.

Love turns around...



Jenny, your

Love is a

Drug that I dare

Not take, a

Drug to make me mad...



Rose, I'd never

Harm the girl.



JENNY: (overlapping)

Love

Has turned my

World around,

And my

World now turns round

Alex...



ROSE:

Love should not

Be used as a weapon.

Why, Alex,

Why can't you

See it's George you're...?



ALEX, JENNY & ROSE:

Breaking

And burning...



Breaking

And bleeding...



In the name of

Love...



GEORGE:

Love is a

Knife. It's a curse.

A cancer.

To love is to

Hate letting

Go...

Jenny, I can

Never share your

Love...



ALEX, JENNY, ROSE & GEORGE:

And I'm falling,

I am suddenly falling,

And my story

Is older than the stars...



ALEX, JENNY & ROSE:

Suddenly falling

I can feel myself falling...

Down into this

Madhoise

Of love...



GEORGE:

Suddenly falling

I can feel myself falling...

In this

Madhouse of

Love...
