Mermaid Song


JENNY:

I am a mermaid

With golden hair...



ALEX:

I've never seen one like you!



JENNY:

Not all us mermaids

Have silver tails --

I have no tail at all!



ALEX:

Well, I've never,

Seen any mermaids

With knobbly knees!

I'd say this tale

Was a touch too tall,

Maybe a touch too tall...



JENNY:

Sailors would smash on

My jagged rock,

Lured by my siren's song...



ALEX:

It isn't the

Song of the siren

That tortures men --

That's where your theory

Goes sadly wrong,

That's where it all goes wrong...



JENNY:

I thought you'd know better,

You know nothing

About mermaids.



ALEX: (wry)

You know nothing

About sailors...



JENNY:

I do!

Much more than you!

If you were a sailor

And heard my song,

Would you be lured by me?



ALEX:

I wouldn't be

Foolish enough to

Go near your rock --

I'd steer my galleon out to sea...



BOTH:

...Lonely and lost at sea...
