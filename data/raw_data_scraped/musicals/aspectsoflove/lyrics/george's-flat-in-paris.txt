George's flat in Paris


ELIZABETH

How you've grown!



ALEX

It's been two years.



ELIZABETH

You should have phoned --

Your uncle isn't here.



ALEX

I might have guessed!



ELIZABETH

And such a splendid uniform!



ALEX (looking around the flat)

The same old paintings.



ELIZABETH

Madame will be so thrilled to meet you --

I'll go and tell her.



ALEX

"Giulietta Trapani"...



ELIZABETH (turning back)

Life has changed!

Since those two met

He lives life to the full!



ALEX

Well, good for him!



ELIZABETH

She has made him young again!



ALEX

Where is he now, then?



ELIZABETH

He's doing up the country villa --

They plan to live there.

Now, tell me, do you still like omelettes?

Won't be a moment!



ALEX

And so he got his wicked way with that Italian girl --

He hasn't lost his touch...



ROSE

Well, hello...



ALEX

I should have known

Where you were hiding --

You like the good life,

George likes trinkets!

God, what a fool

I was to love you!

What was all my searching for?

It's never hard to find a whore!



ROSE

Well, if it makes you happy, think it...



ALEX

You scheming bitch...



ROSE

The truth is we're a perfect pair.



ALEX

Because he's rich...



ROSE

Shout and scream --

I don't care...



ALEX

You could have let me know...!



ROSE

Your uncle's shown me new horizons...



ALEX

Well, didn't I?



ROSE

And as a lover he is perfect too.



ALEX

Another lie!



ROSE

He takes his time.

Unlike you.



ALEX

I wasn't good enough?



ROSE

Why can't you listen

And come to your senses?

It's George...

I really love George...

He's made me a

Better, fuller, stronger person,

I have never been as happy!



ALEX

Or, indeed, as wealthy.



ROSE

Look, I don't need your uncle's money!

And I could have a thousand lovers!

Yet I've been faithful and I'm happy --

More faithful than he'll ever be:

It's not as if he's married me...



ALEX (calming)

I'd better go...

I'm sorry...

It was a shock...



ROSE

Try and understand,

And it won't hurt you so much.



ALEX

At least admit you loved me once...



ROSE

Of course I did.

I may even love you now...

George gives me so much...

But he gets so little from me...

But with you I made an impression

That will last you a lifetime...
