First Orchestral Interlude


ALEX (moving close to her)

So change my life for me again...







ALEX

Here we go again!

Heaven knows when she'll be back --

That girl has got a knack

Of keeping you guessing!



ELIZABETH (entering, flustered)

Madame will soon be here,

But she says you are to leave:

Your uncle is coming,

You'd better get going...



ALEX

So why all the panic?

Why shouldn't I be here?



ELIZABETH

She's scared that his heart

Couldn't stand all this drama...



ALEX

Well, it's hardly a shock

If my uncle sees me here...



That girl is unbelievable!

Was last night the sort of thing

She could just forget?

It would be hard to find

A more capricious mind...



ROSE

What are you doing here?



ALEX

All right, where have you been?



ROSE

Will you please disappear?



ALEX

What the hell do you mean?



ROSE (turns away)

Leave me, leave me!

I don't want George exposed

To some unpleasant scene.



ALEX (getting out his gun)

If I can't have you, no one will.

Killing you would be a pleasure.



ROSE

So all you're fit for is to kill?

Go on and pull the trigger,

See if I care!

Come on, soldier!

Be a hero!



ALEX

You never loved me?



ROSE

Does it matter?

You never meant it?

Who remembers?

And now you hate me...

Go away, you little

Schoolboy...

GEORGE

My only genuine Matisse!

Thank God...

No damage done...

Would someone kindly tell me

What on earth has happened?

ELIZABETH

He lost his head,

The gun went off,

She's bleeding badly,

Use your scarf --

Here, let me help...



GEORGE

You'd better phone the doctor.
