Journey of a Lifetime


A circus in Paris. Jenny's 15th birthday. The performance is in full swing.

We see George, Rose, Alex,

and Jenny and at the same time they show that they are thenselves watching.



We are greeted by a whirlwind of activity: clowns, jugglers,

tumblers perform under the streamers and gaudy lights.

Various of the circus performers, led by a chanteuse in exaggerated make-up and costume,

strike up a some as accompaniment -- part hymn in praise of daring,

part invitation for a volunteer from the audience.



At certain points the chanteuse has the circus audience joining in with the song).



CHORUS:

Take the journey of a lifetime!

It's only just a drum-roll away!

On the journey of a lifetime

Every day's a high-wire day!



CHANTEUSE:

If you've got what it takes,

The stars and streamers are yours!

Take a risk in the ring

And feel the thrill of applause!



(Drum-roll. A knife-thrower appears and with his assistant enters the ring. Applause)



If you reach

For the moon,

If you aim

For the stars,

Then the moon

And the sky,

Can be yours --

Come on and try!



There's a prize

To be won

Take a risk,

Take a ride,

Right this way,

Have a go,

Try your luck --

And step inside!



If you reach

For the moon,

If you aim

For the stars,

Then the moon

And the sky,

Can be yours --

Come on and try!



(A volunteer is now being sought for the knife-thrower's act.

Attention focuses on Jenny and Alex, seated side by side.

She asks him to step forward, and when eventually he does, it is much to the annoyance of George.

Alex is led away by the assistant)



CHORUS:

Take the journey of a lifetime!

It's only just a drum-roll away!

On the journey of a lifetime

Every day's a high-wire day!



CHANTEUSE:

If you've got what it takes,

The stars and streamers are yours!

Take a risk in the ring

And feel the thrill of applause!



(Alex now reappears clad in a sequined circus jacket.

He takes up his position and duly braves the hail of knives.

The trick is greeted with great approval by all but George,

who is evidently becoming increasingly distressed by Jenny'sobsession for his nephew.

As the applause fades the song starts up once again.)



If you reach

For the moon,

If you aim

For the stars,

Then the moon

And the sky,

Can be yours --

Come on and try!



There's a prize

To be won

Take a risk,

Take a ride,

Right this way,

Have a go,

Try your luck --

And step inside!
