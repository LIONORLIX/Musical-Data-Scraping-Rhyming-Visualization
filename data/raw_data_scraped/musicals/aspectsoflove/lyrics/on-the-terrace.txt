On the Terrace


FATHER EUGENIO (ALEX)

What does this letter contain?  Give it to me.



DO?A MARIA (ROSE)

But promise me not to read it while you are here.  Read it

this evening -- wait till this evening.  Promise me.  And

tomorrow...no, never speak to me about it.  If you give it

back I shall punish myself for my folly...but for God's sake

don't scold me.



FATHER EUGENIO (ALEX)

Hand it over.



DO?A MARIA (ROSE)

Have pity, I implore you.  I have resisted as long as I could,

but you mustn't open it here.  Oh, God, what are you doing?

Father Eugenio, I implore you.  For pity's sake, give it back.

Father, you are killing me.



FATHER EUGENIO (ALEX)

What are you doing?  Pull yourself together.



GEORGE

You must forgive this rude intrusion,

But I really felt I had to say "Well done"!



ALEX

Oh, uncle George,

Come in, come in...



ROSE

I've heard a million things about you...



GEORGE

And you are...?



ROSE

I am Rose Vibert.



GEORGE

I hate to spoil your fun,

But I was dying for a gin --

But don't let me disturb you.



ROSE

Oh, it's nice to meet you...



GEORGE (warming to the situation)

Surely M?rim?e's "L'Occasion"?



ALEX

Lemon? Ice?



ROSE

The perfect play.



GEORGE

Yet overstated...



ROSE

Yes, that's true.



GEORGE

...And somehow dated now --

A living fossil!



ROSE

How concise!



GEORGE

And Alex, you show promise.



ROSE

Well, he is my pupil!



GEORGE

Ah, so this is your profession?



ALEX

Rising star!



GEORGE

I'm sure, I'm sure.



ROSE

I'm playing Hilde...



ALEX

...In two weeks.



GEORGE

"The Master Builder"?



ROSE

Yes.



GEORGE

What a courageous girl you are.



ROSE

I hate to tear myself away,

But I must go and change --

Please promise me you'll stay.



GEORGE

I wouldn't dream of going far!



I'd like to be the first

To say "She's perfect!" --

A face like that

I haven't seen in years!



ALEX

You must forgive us

For breaking in here.

I'll make it up, George,

Have no fear --

But please don't throw

Us out of here,

I beg you...

Seeing is believing --

I saw her and I loved her...

You must understand what I'm saying --

She's not just someone...



GEORGE

A love affair is not a crisis.

Enjoy it like a fine champagne --

Taste, but never let it

Cloud the brain.

A memory of a happy moment --

That's what this time will one day be.

Life goes on,

Love goes free...



ALEX

Some girls are like that,

They'll love you and leave you,

But Rose --

There's only one Rose...

I'm telling you,

This is not some schoolboy game --

My life will never be the same.



GEORGE

I look at you and

ALEX

I knew it from the moment

I remember

That I saw her face...

How many times I've

There could

Felt this way --

Never be

Ah, the tricks

Any other

Love can play...

Love for me...

GEORGE

Alex, quick!

Some brandy!



ROSE

You go...



ALEX

I'll go...



ROSE

Quickly...



ALEX (hurrying out)

I'm going...



GEORGE

Do forgive me...

So unlike me...

You looked just like her...

My wife...

Delia...

I thought for a moment...

The dress was hers,

But you look just as lovely --

It should be worn...



I've caused such drama here...



ROSE

You mustn't think that...



GEORGE

It wasn't meant, my dear...

I'd better leave you two alone...



ROSE

You're in no state to travel --

No,

You won't go anywhere.

You're staying in that chair.

Why spend the evening on your own?



ALEX

Why, why must he spy on us?

It was perfect till he came!

Why, why must he ruin it?







GEORGE

...Of course, painting always was my first love.



ROSE

Oh, to be so gifted.



GEORGE

When I'm dead they'll fetch a fortune.



ALEX

We shall see.



ROSE

I'd buy one now.



ALEX (to GEORGE)

You'd better tell her...



ROSE

Tell me what?



ALEX

...Before you sell her one,

That they're just copies...



GEORGE

But by me!



ROSE (changing the subject, to GEORGE)

I'd love to hear your poems!



GEORGE

I shall write one for you...



ALEX

Byron isn't here to sue you.



ROSE

Alex, please --

Don't interrupt.



GEORGE

At least I do things.



ROSE

Yes, that's true.



GEORGE

...I see a few things through...



We often have disputes like these.



Did Alex ever tell you...



ALEX

We'll be here till breakfast...



GEORGE (ignoring him, continues)

...Why his final year

At school was rather short?



ROSE

No, not a word.



ALEX (horrified realization)

No, George, you couldn't...



ROSE

Please go on!



ALEX

No, George, you wouldn't dare...



GEORGE

I think it might amuse her...



I've had a splendid time,

A truly splendid time --

But I can see that I'm de trop...

I have a little tryst

Too tempting to resist,

And now I really ought to go...



I wish you both a charming fortnight,

Enjoy your little one-to-one --

Have your fling,

Have your fun...



A memory of a happy moment --

That's what these days will one day be...

Life goes on,

Love goes free...



ALEX

I think I know where he's gone --

He's off to take his Italian lessons!



ROSE

How could you have let me wear this dress?

He must think I have no feelings!

You should have said what he was like...

I must seem a heartless woman!

I must seem a soulless creature!



Anyway, let's not have a scene..
