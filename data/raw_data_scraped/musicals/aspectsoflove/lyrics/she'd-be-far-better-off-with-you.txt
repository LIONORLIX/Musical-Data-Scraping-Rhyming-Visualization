She'd Be Far Better Off with You


ALEX

I should never have come back here...



GEORGE

Oh, don't talk such nonsense!



ALEX

I'll bow out now --

It's the decent thing to do.



GEORGE

Don't be absurd.



ALEX

I'm a disaster...



GEORGE

Oh, come, come!



ALEX

...It wouldn't last a week --

She'd be far better off with you.



GEORGE

You two have your lives before you.



ALEX

It would end in murder...



GEORGE

I'm too old for her --

It's high time I withdrew.



ALEX

Your place is here.



GEORGE

The jowls are dropping...



ALEX

It's the light.



GEORGE

...The paunch needs propping up --

She'd be far better off with you.



BOTH

Your words are generous and selfless,

But alas untrue --

She'd be far better off with you.



ALEX

You are steeped in wit and wisdom.



GEORGE

Well, I've learnt the odd thing...



ALEX

You could teach George Bernard Shaw

A thing or two!



GEORGE

I had a go...



ALEX

You've dined with Garbo...



GEORGE

Only twice.



ALEX

...Translated "La Boheme" --

She'd be far better off with you.



GEORGE

You're atheletic.



ALEX

You're distinguished.



GEORGE

You don't cheat at croquet.



ALEX

You're more seasoned.



GEORGE

You can skate.



ALEX

You're in "Who's Who".



GEORGE

Just half an inch.



ALEX

We're talking drivel.



GEORGE

So we are.



BOTH

Can't we be civilized?

She'd be far better off with you.

Your words are generous and selfless,

But alas untrue.

It's only Rose that matters!

Just take a look; there's no comparison

Between us two --

She'd be far better off with you!
