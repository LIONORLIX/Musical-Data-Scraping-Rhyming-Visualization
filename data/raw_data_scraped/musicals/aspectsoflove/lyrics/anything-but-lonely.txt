Anything But Lonely


ROSE:

Anything but lonely,

Anything but empty rooms.

There's so much in life to share --

What's the sense when no one else is there?



Anything but lonely,

Anything but only me.

Quiet years in too much space:

That's the thing that's hard to face,

And...



You have a right to go,

But you should also know

That I won't be alone for long.

Long days with nothing said

Are not what lie ahead --

I'm sorry, but I'm not that strong.



Anything but lonely,

Anything but passing time.

Lonely's what I'll never be,

While there's still some life in me,

And...



I'm still young, don't forget,

It isn't over yet --

So many hearts for me to thrill.



If you're not here to say

How good I look each day,

I'll have to find someone who will.



Anything but lonely,

Anything but empty rooms.

There's so much in life to share --

What's the sense when no one else is

there...?



Just promise one thing.



ALEX:

All right.

What is it?



ROSE:

Don't ask me questions...

You must promise first...



ALEX:

I can't

I must know what it is.



ROSE:

Don't leave me!
