A Memory of a Happy Moment


GIULIETTA

There'll never be another you...

But, as you say, you are his guardian,

And sacrifices must be made.

We must part,

I'm afraid...

So put "Giulietta" thoughts behind you,

Forget about your broken heart!



Back to Venice...

Tend my art...



GEORGE (moving across to her)

A love affair is not a lifetime.

It's calendars and clocks, my friend.

All good things

Have to end.

A memory of a happy moment --

That's what this week will one day be.

Life goes on,

Love goes free.



GIULIETTA (alone)

Life goes on...

Love goes free...
