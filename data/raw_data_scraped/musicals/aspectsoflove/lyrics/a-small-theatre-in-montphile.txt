A Small Theatre in Montphile


A VOICE (down in the garden)

The master builder is dead!



OTHER VOICES

His head is all smashed in.... He fell right into the quarry.



HILDE (ROSE) (turns to RAGNAR and says quietly)

I can't see him up there now.



RAGNAR

This is terrible. So in fact he couldn't do it.



HILDE (ROSE) (with a kind of quiet, bewildered triumph)

But he got right to the top.

My...my...master builder!



ROSE

The toast of the town?

The hit of the year?

The birth of a star?

The end of a career!



MARCEL

Darling, these things happen...



ROSE

You turn round and tell us

We're closed for two weeks!



MARCEL

Rose, I thought of everything...



ROSE

You thought of nothing!



MARCEL

...There are posters in the streets

And banners in the squares.

Scream away, feel free,

But at Ibsen, not at me...



ROSE (interrupting)

Why did I agree

To accept this bloody tour?

The only thing in store

Is two weeks of nothing!



ACTORS (in the background, to one another)

Win some, lose some...

What the hell...



ROSE

Working till I drop

For an audience of four:

Three nuns and your mother...



MARCEL

It's no good complaining...



ROSE

And she only bothered

Because it was raining!



MARCEL

Love...



ROSE

Don't call me 'Love'!



MARCEL

This isn't personal.



ACTORS (departing, to one another)

I don't care... The theatre's my life...



MARCEL

We will start the tour again

In Lyon in two weeks!

Rose, the people there

Are all Ibsen mad, I swear!

Come on, show me a smile!



ROSE (turning away)

God, I'm not in the mood...



MARCEL

What's a fortnight or so?



ROSE

With no money or food...



MARCEL

Don't be glum...



ACTORS

Don't let's be downhearted!



ROSE

Don't waste your breath.



ACTORS

We'll get by...



MARCEL

Now Rose, you must meet this young man!

He's a dedicated fan --

Been in every evening!



ROSE

Marcel, don't run away --

I can see your little plan.



ALEX (approaching nervously)

It's an honor, mam'selle,

I could watch you for hours...

You can't have forgotten,

I threw you the flowers...

Mam'selle, seeing you on stage

Has changed my life!



ACTORS (exiting, to one another and to ROSE)

Join us in the cafe

In the square!



ROSE

See you...

The cafe...

The square...



ALEX (to ROSE, tentatively)

Would you let me walk you there...?
