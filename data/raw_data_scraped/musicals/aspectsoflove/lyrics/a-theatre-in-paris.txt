A theatre in Paris


NATALIA (ROSE)

Natalia Petrovna....  Unhappy woman, for the first time in

your life...you are in love.



MARCEL

If Turgenev were here

He'd order champagne!

A triumph, my dear!



ROSE

What a night to end with...



MARCEL

Rose, you were incredible!



ROSE

They seemed to like it...



MARCEL

I have never heard a crowd

Make a noise like that!



A PASSING VISITOR (clapping MARCEL on the shoulder)

It's your best production!



MARCEL (to ROSE, continuing)

Are we in the mood

For debauchery and food?



ROSE

Marcel, you are a dear

But a most forgetful man!

I've told you that I plan

To drive through the country.



VISITORS (severally)

Well done, darling...

Well done you...



ROSE (to MARCEL, continuing)

Have a lovely night!

Come and see me when you can.



Now come along, Hugo.



HUGO

I'm ready, don't worry.

I've done all the packing,

There's no need to hurry.



GUEST 1

Tonight was a wonder!



GUEST 2

A soaring sensation!



ROSE

The best thing is having

My friends' admiration
