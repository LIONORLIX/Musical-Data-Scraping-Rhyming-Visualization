There is More to Love


GIULIETTA:

There is more to love,

So much more,

Than simply making love --

That's easy.



Gazing into eyes,

Pretty eyes,

Which could be any eyes --

That's crazy.



Hands are just hands,

A face is just a face...

They come and go --

They're easy to replace...



There is more to love,

So much more,

Than moon-struck escapades --

That's nothing.



There is peace of mind,

So much peace,

In quiet company --

That's something.



Everyone but him

Seems wrong for me...

Every time I feel

There has to be

More...



If I could hear

The music I heard then,

I'd never let

It fade away again...



Now each time

Love reaches out to me,

I can only feel

There has to be

So much more

To love...



There is more ot love,

So much more...
