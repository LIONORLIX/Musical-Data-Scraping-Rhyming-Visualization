Magical Lasso


Like yellow parchment is his skin ...

A great black hole served as the nose that never grew ...

You must be always on your guard,

Or he will catch you with his magical lasso!



MADAME GIRY:



Those who speak of what they know find,

Too late, that prudent silence is wise.

Joseph Buquet, hold your tongue -

He will burn you with the heat of his eyes!
