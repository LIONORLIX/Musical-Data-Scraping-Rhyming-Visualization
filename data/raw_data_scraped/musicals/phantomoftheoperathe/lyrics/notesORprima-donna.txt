Notes/Prima Donna


Firmin

"Mystery after gala night," it says, "mystery of sopranos flight".

"Mystified," all the papers say, "We are mystified. We suspect foul play!"

Bad news on soprano scene

First Carlotta, now Christine.

Still at least the seats get sold,

Gossip's worth its weight in gold.

What a way to run a business

Spare me these unending trials

Half your cast disappears

But the crowd still cheers

Opera!

To hell with Gluck and Handel

Have a scandal and you're sure to have a hit!



Andre

Damnable!

Will they all walk out?

This is damnable!



Firmin

Andre please don't shout

It's publicity and the take is vast

Free publicity



Andre

But we have no cast!



Firmin

Andre have you seen the queue

Ah, it seems you've got one too



Andre

"Dear Andre what a charming gala,

Christine was in a word sublime

We were hardly bereft when Carlotta left

On that note: The diva's a disaster,

Must you cast her when she's seasons past her prime?"



Firmin

"Dear Firmin just a brief reminder;

My salary has not been paid

Send it care of the ghost

By return of post

P.T.O No one likes a debter so it's better if my orders are obeyed!"



Andre & Firmin

Who would have the gall to send this?

Someone with a puerile brain

These are both signed O.G

Who the hell is he?

Opera Ghost!



Firmin

It is nothing short of shocking



Andre

He is mocking our position



Firmin

In addition he wants money



Andre

What a funny apparition



Andre & Firmin

To expect a large retainer

Nothing plainer

He is clearly quite insane



Raoul

Where is she?



Andre

You mean Carlotta?



Raoul

I mean Miss Daae.

Where is she?



Firmin

Well how should we know?



Raoul

I want an answer

I take it that you sent me this note



Andre

What all this nonsense?

Of course not



Firmin

Don't look at us



Raoul

She's not with you then?



Firmin

Of course not



Andre

We're in the dark



Raoul

Monsieur don't argue

Isn't this the letter you wrote



Firmin

And what is is that we're meant to have wrote?

...Written!



Andre

D"o not fear for Miss Daae

The Angel of Music has her under his wing

Make no attempt to see her again."



Raoul

If you didn't write it then who did?



Carlotta

Where is he?



Andre

Ah, welcome back!



Carlotta & Piangi

Where is he?

Your precious patron

Where is he?



Raoul

What is it now?



Carlotta

I have your letter

A letter that which I rather resent



Firmin

And did you send it?



Raoul

Of course not!



Andre

As if he would



Carlotta & Piangi

You didn't send it?



Raoul

Of course not!



Firmin

What going on?



Carlotta

You dare to tell me

That this is not the letter you sent



Raoul

And what is it that I'm meant to have sent?

"Your days at the Opera Populaire are numbered.

Christine Daae will be singing on your behalf tonight.

Be prepared for a great misfortune should you attempt to take her place."



Andre & Firmin

Far too many notes for my taste

And most of them about Christine

All we've heard since we came

Is Miss Daae's name



Madame Giry

Miss Daae has returned



Firmin

No worse for wear as far as we're concerned



Andre

Where precisely is she now?



Madame Giry

I thought it best she was alone



Meg

She needed rest



Raoul

May I see her?



Madame Giry

No monsieur she will see no one



Carlotta & Piangi

Will she sing?

Will she sing?



Madame Giry

Here I have a note



All (except Madame Giry and Meg)

Let me see it



Firmin

Please

"Gentlemen, I have now sent you several notes of the most aimnable nature detailing how my Opera House is to be run

You have ignored my orders...



Phantom

...I shall give you one last chance

Christine Daae has returned to you

And I am anxious her career should progress

In the new production of Il Muto

You will therefore cast Carlotta as the page boy

And put Miss Daae in the role of Countess

The role which Miss Daae plays calls for charm and appeal

The role of the page boy is silent which makes my casting in a word, ideal

I shall watch the performance from my normal seat in box 5 which will be kept empty for me

Should these commands be ignored a disaster beyond your imagination will occur

I remain, gentlemen, your obedient servant

O.G



Carlotta & Piangi

Christine!



Andre

What ever next?



Carlotta & Piangi

It's all a ploy to help Christine



Firmin

This is insane



Carlotta

I know who sent this

The Viscount, her lover



Raoul

Indeed, can you belive this?



Firmin

Signora



Carlotta

O tradori!



Andre

This is a joke



Firmin

This changes nothing



Carlotta

O mentitori



Firmin

Signora!



Andre

You are our star



Firmin

And always will be



Andre

Signora



Firmin

The man is made



Andre

We don't take orders



Firmin

Miss Daae will be playing the page boy

The silent role



Andre & Firmin

Carlotta will be playing the lead



Charlotta

It's useless trying to appease me



Piangi

Appease her!



Carlotta

You're only saying this to please me



Piangi

Please her!



Carlotta & Piangi

Lasciatemi morire!

O padre mio!

Dio!



Madame Giry

Who scorn his word beware to those



Carlotta

You have reviled me!



Madame Giry

The angel sees, the angel knows



Raoul

Why did Christine fly from my arms?



Carlotta

You have rebuked me!



Andre & Firmin

Sinora, pardon us



Carlotta

You have replaced me



Aandre & Firmin

Please Signora we beseech you



Madame Giry

This hour shall see your darkest fears



Raoul

I must see her



Carlotta & Piangi

Abbandonata!

Deseredata!

O, sventurata!



Madame Giry

The angel sees, the angel hears



Raoul

Where did she go?



Carlotta & Piangi

Abbandonata!



Andre & Firmin

Senora sing for us



Carlotta & Piangi

Disgraziata!



Andre & Firmin

Don't be a matyr



All

What new suprises lie in store



Andre

Your public needs you



Firmin

We need you too



Carlotta

Wouldn't you rather have your precious little ingenue?



Andre & Firmin

Signora no! The World wants you

Prima Donna first lady of the stage

Your devotees are on their knees to implore you



Andre

Can you bow out when they're shouting your name?



Firmin

Think of how they all adore you



Andre & Firmin

Prima donna enchant us once again



Andre

Think of your muse



Firmin

And all your queues 'round the theatre!



Andre & Firmin

Can you deny us the triumph in store?



Andre, Firmin & Piangi

Sing Prima Donna once more



Raoul

Christine spoke of an angel



Charlotta

Prima Donna your song shall live again



Andre & Firmin

Think of your public



Carlotta

You took a snub but there's a public who needs you



Madame Giry

She has heard the voice of the Angel of Music



Andre & Firmin

Those who hear you liken you to an angel



Carlotta

Think of the cry of undying support



Andre

We get her Opera



Firmin

She gets her limelight



Carlotta

Follow where the lime light leads you



Andre & Firmin

Leading ladies are a trial



Carlotta

Prima Donna your song shall never die

You'll sing again and to unending ovation



Raoul

Order, warnings lunatic!



Andre & Firmin

This misacating will invite damnation

Lunatic demands are regular occurences



Carlotta

Think how you'll sing in that final encore



Andre & Firmin

Sing Prima Donna once more



Raoul

I must see these demands are rejected



Andre & Firmin

Who'd believe a diva happy to relieve

A chorus girl whose gone and slept with the patron?

Raoul and the soubrette, entwined in love's duet!

Although he may demur, he must have been with her!



Carlotta

Fortunata!

Non ancor abbandonata!



Andre & Firmin

You'd never get away with all this in a play,

but if it's loudly sung and in a foreign tongue

It's just the sort of story audiences adore, in fact a perfect opera!



Meg & Christine

For if his curse is on this Opera



All

Prima Donna the world is at your feet

A nation waits, and how it hates to be cheated!

Light Up the stage with that age-old rapport,

Sing Prima Donna

Once more!



Phantom

So, it is to be war between us. If these demands are not met,  a disaster beyond imagination will occur!



All

Once more!
