Poor Fool, He Makes Me Laugh/Il Muto


They say that this youth has set my Lady's heart aflame!

His Lordship, sure, would die of shock

His Lordship is a laughing-stock!

Should he suspect her, God protect her!

Shame! Shame! Shame!

This faithless lady's bound for HADES!

Shame! Shame! Shame!

Serafimo - your disguise is perfect.

Who can this be?

Gentle wife, admit your loving husband.

My love - I am called to England on affairs of State,

And must leave you with your new maid.

Though I'd happily take the maid with me.

Serafimo - away with this pretence!

You cannot speak, but kiss me in my husband's absence!

Poor fool, he makes me laugh!

You cannot speak, but kiss me in my ...

Poor fool, he makes me laugh -

Ladies and gentlemen, we apologize, the performance will continue in ten minutes' time ...

Meanwhile, we'd like to give you the ballet from Act Three of tonight's opera.

Are you alright?

Raoul, we're not safe here

Ladies and gentlemen, please remain in your seats.

Do not panic.

It was an accident ... simply an accident
