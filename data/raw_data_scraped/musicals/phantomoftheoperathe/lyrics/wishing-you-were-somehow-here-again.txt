Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again


You were once my one companion

You were all that mattered

You were once a friend and father

Then my world was shattered



Wishing you were somehow here again

Wishing you were somehow near

Sometimes it seem if I just dream

Somehow you would be here



Wishing I could hear your voice again

Knowing that I never would

Dreaming of you won't help me to do

All that you dreamed I could



Passing bells and sculpted angels

Cold and monumental

Seem for you the wrong companions

You were warm and gentle



Too many years

Fighting back tears

Why can't the past just die



Wishing you were somehow here again

Knowing we must say goodbye

Try to forgive teach me to live

Give me the strength to try

No more memories no more silent tears

No more gazing across the wasted years

Help me say goodbye'.
