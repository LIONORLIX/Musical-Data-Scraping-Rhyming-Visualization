Journey to the Cemetery


CHRISTINE:

To my father's grave, please.



In sleep he sang to me, in dreams he came

That voice which calls to me and speaks my name...



Little Lotte thought of everything and nothing

Her Father promised her that he would send her the Angel of Music

Her father promised her? Her father promised her...
