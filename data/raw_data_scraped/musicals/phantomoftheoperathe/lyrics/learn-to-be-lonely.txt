Learn to Be Lonely


Child of the wilderness

Born into emptiness

Learn to be lonely

Learn to find your way in darkness



Who will be there for you

Comfort and care for you

Learn to be lonely

Learn to be your one companion



Never dreamed out in the world

There are arms to hold you

You’ve always known your heart was on its own



So laugh in your loneliness

Child of the wilderness

Learn to Be lonely

Learn how to love life that is lived alone



Learn to be lonely

Learn to be your one companion



Never dreamed out in the world

There are arms to hold you

You’ve always known your heart was on its own



So laugh in your loneliness

Child of the wilderness

Learn to Be lonely

Learn how to love life that is lived alone



Learn to be lonely

Life can be lived life can be loved alone
