All I Ask of You


RAOUL

No more talk of darkness,

Forget these wide-eyed fears

I'm here, nothing can harm you

my words will warm and calm you

Let me be your freedom,

let daylight dry your tears.

I'm here with you, beside you,

to guard you and to guide you...



CHRISTINE

Say you love me every waking moment,

turn my head with talk of summertime...

Say you need me with you now and always...

Promise me that all you say is true

that's all I ask of you



RAOUL

Let me be your shelter

let me be your light

You're safe, No one will find you

your fears are far behind you...



CHRISTINE

All I want is freedom,

a world with no more night

and you, always beside me, to hold me and to hide me...



RAOUL

Then say you'll share with me

one love, one lifetime

let me lead you from your solitude

Say you need me with you here, beside you...

anywhere you go, let me go too

Christine, that's all I ask of you...



CHRISTINE

Say you'll share with me one love, one lifetime...

say the word and I will follow you...

(right) BOTH:

Share each day with me,

each night, each morning...

(right) CHRISTINE

Say you love me...



RAOUL

You know I do...



BOTH

Love me - that's all I ask of you

Anywhere you go let me go too

Love me - that's all I ask of you...
