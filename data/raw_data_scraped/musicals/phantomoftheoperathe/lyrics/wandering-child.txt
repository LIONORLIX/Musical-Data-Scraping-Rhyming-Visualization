Wandering Child


The PHANTOM emerges from behind the cross)

PHANTOM (very soft and enticing)

Wandering child . . .

So lost . . .

So helpless . . .

Yearning for my

Guidance . . .



(Bewildered, CHRISTINE looks up, and murmurs

breathlessly):



CHRISTINE

Angel . . . or father . . .

Friend . . . or

Phantom . . . ?

Who is it there,

Staring . . . ?



PHANTOM (more and more hypnotic)

Have you forgotten your Angel . . .?



CHRISTINE

Angel . . . oh, speak . . .

What endless longings

Echo in this whisper . . .!



(RAOUL appears in the shadows and watches for a moment transfixed)



PHANTOM (now drawing CHRISTINE towards him)

Too long you've wandered in winter . . .

RAOUL (to himself a murmur)

Once again

She is his . . .



PHANTOM

Far from my far-reaching gaze . . .



RAOUL

Once again she returns . . .



CHRISTINE (increasingly mesmerized)

Wildly my mind beats against you . . .



PHANTOM

You resist . . .



PHANTOM/CHRISTINE

Yet your/the soul

Obeys . . .



RAOUL

. . . to the arms

Of her angel . . .

Angel or demon . . .

Still he calls her . . .

Luring her back, from the grave . . .

Angel or dark seducer . . .?

Who are you, strange

Angel . . .?



PHANTOM

Angel of Music!

You denied me/I denied you

Turning from true beauty . . .

Angel of Music!

Do not shun me/My protector . . .

Come to your strange

Angel . . .



CHRISTINE

Angel of Music!



(CHRISTINE moves towards the figure of the

PHANTOM)



PHANTOM (beckoning her)

I am your Angel of Music . . .

Come to me: Angel of Music . . .



RAOUL (suddenly calling out)

Angel of darkness!

Cease this torment!



(Inexorably the PHANTOM continues to beckon

CHRISTINE)



PHANTOM

I am your Angel of Music . . .

Come to me: Angel of Music . . .



RAOUL (in desperation)

Christine! Christine listen to me!

Whatever you may believe, this man . . .

this thing . . . is not your father!

(to the PHANTOM)

Let her go! For God's sake, let her go! Christine !

(Coming out of her trance CHRISTINE turns and

mouths the words):



CHRISTINE

Raoul . .
