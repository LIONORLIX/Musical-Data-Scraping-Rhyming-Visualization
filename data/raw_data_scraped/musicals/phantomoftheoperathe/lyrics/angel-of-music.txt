PHANTOM

Bravi, bravi, bravissimi



MEG

Christine, Christine



PHANTOM

Christine



MEG

Where in the world have you been hiding

Really, you were perfect

I only wish I knew your secret

Who is your great tutor



CHRISTINE

Meg

When your mother brought me here to live

Whenever Iâ€™d come down here alone

To light a candle for my father

A voice from above

And in my dreams

He was always there

You see, when my father lay dying

He told me I will be protected by an angel

An angel of music



MEG

Christine, do you believe?

Do you think the spirit of your father is coaching you?



CHRISTINE

who else, meg?

Father once spoke of an angel

I used to dream he'd appear

Now as I sing, I can sense him

And I know he's here

Here in this room he calls me softly

Somewhere inside hiding

Somehow I know he's always with me

He, the unseen genius



MEG

Christine, you must have been dreaming

Stories like this can't come true

Christine, you are talking in riddles

And it's not like you



CHRISTINE

Angel of Music

Guide and guardian

Grant to me your glory



MEG

Who is this angel

This...



BOTH

Angel of Music

Hide no longer

Secret and strange angel



CHRISTINE

He's with me, even now



MEG

Your hands are cold



CHRISTINE

All around me



MEG

Your face, Christine, is white



CHRISTINE

It frightens me



MEG

Don't be frightened



MME. GIRY

No, no

You did very well, my dear

He's pleased with you



FIRMIN

Ah, Vicomte, vicomte I think we've made

quite a discovery with Miss Daae



ANDRE

Perhaps we can present her to you,



FIRMIN

dear Vicomte



RAOUL

Gentlemen, if you wouldn't mind, this is one

visit I should prefer to make unaccompanied.

Thank you



FIRMIN

It would appear they've met before



ANDRE

Yes
