Little Lotte/The Mirror


Little Lotte



RAOUL

Little Lotte let her mind wander

Little Lotte thought: Am I fonder of dolls

or of goblins or shoes?



CHRISTINE

Raoul



RAOUL

or of riddles of frocks



CHRISTINE

Those picnics in the attic



RAOUL

or of chocolates



CHRISTINE

Father playing the violin



RAOUL

As we read to each other dark stories of the North



CHRISTINE

No - what I love best, Lotte said,

is when I'm asleep in my bed

and the Angel of Music sings songs in my head!



BOTH

The Angel of Music sings songs in my head!



RAOUL

You sang like an angel tonight



CHRISTINE

Father said, 'When I'm in heaven, child

I will send the Angel of Music to you'.

Well, father is dead, Raoul, and I have been

visited by the Angel of Music.



RAOUL

Oh, no doubt of it - And now we'll go to supper!



CHRISTINE

No, Raoul, the Angel of Music is very strict.



RAOUL

Well, I shan't keep you up late!



CHRISTINE

Raoul, no



RAOUL

You must change. I'll order my carriage.

Two minutes - Little Lotte.



CHRISTINE

No, Raoul, wait!



PHANTOM

Insolent boy!

This slave of fashion

basking in your glory!



Ignorant fool!

This brave young suitor,

sharing in my triumph!



CHRISTINE

Angel! I hear you!

Speak, I listen...

stay by my side, guide me!



Angel, my soul was weak

forgive me...

enter at last, Master!



PHANTOM

Flattering child

you shall know me,

see why in shadow I hide

Look at your face in the mirror

I am there inside!



CHRISTINE

Angel of Music!

Guide and guardian!

Grant to me your glory!



Angel of Music!

Hide no longer!

Come to me, strange angel



PHANTOM

I am your Angel of Music

Come to me: Angel of Music



RAOUL

Whose is that voice?

Who is that in there?



PHANTOM

I am your Angel of Music



RAOUL

Christine, Christine



PHANTOM

Come to me: Angel of Music







The Mirror



PHANTOM'S VOICE

Insolent boy!

This slave of fashion

basking in your glory!



Ignorant fool!

This brave young suitor,

sharing in my triumph!



CHRISTINE

Angel, I hear you.

Speak - I listen . . .

stay by my side,

guide me.



Angel, my soul was weak -

forgive me . . .

enter at last,

Master.



PHANTOM'S VOICE

Flattering child, you shall know me,

see why in shadow I hide.



Look at your face in the mirror -

I am there inside!





CHRISTINE

Angel of Music,

Guide and guardian,

Grant to me your

glory.



Angel of Music,

Hide no longer.

Come to me, strange

Angel...



PHANTOM'S VOICE

I am your Angel of Music...

Come to me: Angel of Music ...

Who is that voice?

Who's in there?

I am your Angel of Music...

Come to me: Angel of Music ......
