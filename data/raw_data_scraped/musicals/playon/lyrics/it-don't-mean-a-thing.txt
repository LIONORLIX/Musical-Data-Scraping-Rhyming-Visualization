It Don't Mean a Thing


It don't mean a thing, if it ain't got that swing

(doo-ah, doo-ah, doo-ah, doo-ah, doo-ah, doo-ah, doo-ah, doo-ah, doo-ah)

It don't mean a thing all you got to do is sing

(doo-ah, doo-ah, doo-ah, doo-ah, doo-ah, doo-ah, doo-ah, doo-ah, doo-ah)

It makes no difference

If it's sweet or hot

Just give that rhythm

Everything you've got

It don't mean a thing, if it ain't got that swing

(doo-ah, doo-ah, doo-ah, doo-ah, doo-ah, doo-ah, doo-ah, doo-ah, doo-ah)

It don't mean a thing all you got to do is sing

(doo-ah, doo-ah, doo-ah, doo-ah, doo-ah, doo-ah, doo-ah, doo-ah, doo-ah)

It makes no difference

If it's sweet or hot

Just give that rhythm

Everything you've got

It don't mean a thing, if it ain't got that swing

(doo-ah, doo-ah, doo-ah, doo-ah, doo-ah, doo-ah, doo-ah, doo-ah, doo-ah)



It makes no difference

If it's sweet or hot

Just give that rhythm

Everything you've got

It don't mean a thing if it ain't got that swing

It don't mean a thing all you got to do is sing

(doo-ah)

It makes no difference

If it's sweet or hot

Just give that rhythm

Everything you've got

Don't mean a thing all you've gotta do is swing

It don't mean a thing all you've gotta do is sing

It makes no difference

If it's sweet or hot

Give that rhythm

Everything you've got

It don't mean a thing if it ain't got that swing

(doo-ah, dooooo-aaaaah)

Don't mean a thing
