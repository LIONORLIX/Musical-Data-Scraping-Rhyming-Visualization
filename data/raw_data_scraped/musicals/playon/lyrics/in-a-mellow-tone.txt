In a Mellow Tone


In a mellow tone

Feeling fancy free

And I'm not alone

I've got company



Everything's ok

The live long day

With this mellow song

I can't go wrong



In a mellow tone

That's the way to live

If you mope and groan

Something's gotta give



Just go your way

And laugh and play

There's joy unknown

In a mellow tone



(scat)

In a mellow tone

(bridge)



In a mellow tone

Feeling fancy free

And I'm not alone

I've got company



Everything's ok

The live long day

With this mellow song

I can't go wrong



In a mellow tone

That's the way to live

If you mope and groan

Something's gotta give



Just go your way

And laugh and play

There's joy unknown

In a mellow tone

In a mellow tone

In a mellow tone
