I'm Just a Lucky So and So


If you should ask me the amount in my bank account

I'd have to confess that I'm slippin'

But that don't worry me, confidentially

I've got a dream that's a pippin'



And when the day is through

Each night I hurry to

A home where love waits, I know

I guess I'm just a lucky, lucky so and so



As I walk down the street

Sinsing to everyone I meet

Gives me a friendly hello, yeah

I guess I'm just a lucky so, lucky so and so

Lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky



Birds in every tree

Are all so neighborly

They sing wherever I go, sing pretty

I guess I'm just a lucky, woh what a lucky so and so



As if you should ask me the amount in my bank account

I'd have to admit, I'd have to confess that I'm slippin'

But that don't worry me, confidentially

I've got a dream that's a pippin'



Yeah, and when the day, and when the day is through

Each night I hurry to

A home, a home where love waits and I know

I guess, I guess I'm just a lucky, lucky, lucky so and so

So lucky, so and so



If you should ask me the amount in my bank account

I'd have to admit, I'd have to confess that I'm slippin'

But that don't worry me, yes, confidentially

I've got a dream that's a pippin'



And when the day is through

Each night I hurry to

A home where love waits, I know

I guess I'm just a lucky so and so



Just a lucky so and so

Just a lucky so and so

Oh, baby you're lucky

Yeah, just a lucky so

That's what, I'm lucky



I'll say I'm lucky

Yeah, yeah, I'm lucky

I'm a lucky, lucky, lucky so and so

A lucky so and so

I'm lucky, yeah, tell me about it



Oh, the people in the street, stare about me

Tell me where they'll treat me

They say, "Hey baby, you're a lucky

You're lucky, luck-luck-lucky, you're a lucky so and so

Yeah, you're lucky

C'mon girl, you know you're lucky, are you ready



Yeah, you're lucky

Just a lucky, lucky, lucky

Lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky so and so

How a lucky so and so

Lucky so and so

How lucky

Hey, you're lucky, how lucky"
