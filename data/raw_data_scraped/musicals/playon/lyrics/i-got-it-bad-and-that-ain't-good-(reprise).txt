I Got It Bad and That Ain't Good (Reprise)


The poets say that all who love are blind

Well I'm inl ove and I know what time it is

The good books say go seekand ye shall find

Well I have sought and my what a climb it is

My life is just like tha weather it changes with the hour

When he's near I'm fair and warmer

When he is gone I'm cloudy with showers

Any motion loke the ocean

It's either sink or swim

When a woman loves a man like I love him



Never treats me sweet and gentle the way he should

I got it bad and that ain't good



My poor heart is sentimental

Not made of wood

I got it bad and that ain't good



But when the weekend's over

And Monday rolls around

I end up like I start out

Just crying my heart out



He don't love me like I love nobody could

I got it bad and that ain't good



The folks with good intentions

Tell me to save my tears

I'm glad I'm mad about him

I can't live without him



Lord above me,make him love me

The way he should

I got it bad and that ain't good
