Take the "A" Train


You must take the "A" train

To go to Sugar Hill, way up in Harlem

If you miss the "A" train

You'll find you missed the quickest way to Harlem



Hurry, get on, now it's coming

Listen to those rails a-thrumming all aboard

Get on the "A" train

Soon you will be on Sugar Hill in Harlem



You must take the "A" train

To go to Sugar Hill, way up in Harlem



You must take the "A" train

To go to Sugar Hill, way up in Harlem

If you miss the "A" train

You'll miss the quickest way to Harlem



Hurry, get on board, it's comin'

Listen to those rails a-thrumming all aboard

Get on the "A" train

Soon you will be on Sugar Hill in Harlem



Harlem, boy

Next stop is Harlem



Next stop, Harlem

Come on, get aboard the "A" train



Get aboard

Next stop is Harlem

Take the "A" train
