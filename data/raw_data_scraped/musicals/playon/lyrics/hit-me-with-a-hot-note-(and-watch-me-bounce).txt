Hit Me With a Hot Note (And Watch Me Bounce)


Hit me with a hot note and watch me bounce

Hit me with a hot note and watch me bounce

When trumpets heat up, give me rug to beat up

Hit me with a hot note and watch me bounce



Hit me with a hot note and watch me burn

Slap me down with rhythm from stern to stern

When saxes flare up, how can I keep my hair up

Hit me with a hot note and watch me bounce



Start those trombones sliding

While I gather steam

Keep that tempo riding

And I'll come in right on the beat, well



Hit me with a hot note and watch me bounce

Knock me out with music in great amounts

Oh let that beat wade, we're gonna have a heat wave

Hit me with a hot note and watch me bounce



Start those trombones sliding

While I gather steam

Keep that tempo riding,

And I'll come in right on the beat, well



Hit me with a hot note and watch me bounce

Knock me out with music in great amounts

Oh let that beat wade, we gonna have a heat wave

Hit me, hit me

Hit me with a hot note and watch me bounce
