Something to Live For


I have almost ev'ry thing a human could desire,

Cars and houses, bear-skin rugs to lie before my fire

But there's something missing,

Something isn't there,

It seems I'm negver kissing the one whom I care for.

I want Something To Live For

Someone to make my life an adventurous dream

Oh, what wouln't I give for

Someone who'd take my life and make it seem

gay as they say it ought to be.

Why can't I have love like that brought to me?

My eye is watching the noon crowds

searching the promenades seeking a clue

To the one who will someday be my

Something To Live For.
