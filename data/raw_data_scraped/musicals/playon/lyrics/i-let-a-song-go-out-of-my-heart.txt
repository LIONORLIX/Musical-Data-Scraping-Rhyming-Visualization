I Let a Song Go Out of My Heart


I let a song go out of my heart

It was the sweetest melody

I know I lost heaven

'Cause you were the song



Since you and I had drifted apart

Life doesn't mean a thing to me

Please come back sweet music

I know I was wrong



Am I too late

To make amends

You know that we were meant to be

More than just friends, just friends



I let a song go out of my heart

Believe me darling when I say

I won't know sweet music

Until you return someday
