I Got It Bad (And That Ain't Good)


Never treats me sweet and gentle the way he should;

I got it bad and that ain't good!



My poor heart is sentimental not made of wood

I got it bad and that ain't good!

But when the weekend's over and Monday rolls aroun'

I end up like I start out just cryin' my heart out

He don't love me like I love him nobody could

I got it bad and that ain't good!



Like alonely weeping willow lost in the wood

I got it bad and that ain't good!

And the things I tell my pillow no woman should

I got it bad and that ain't good!

Tho folks with good intentions tell me to save my tears

I'm glad I'm mad about him I can't live without him

Lord above me make him love me the way he should

I got it bad and that ain't good!
