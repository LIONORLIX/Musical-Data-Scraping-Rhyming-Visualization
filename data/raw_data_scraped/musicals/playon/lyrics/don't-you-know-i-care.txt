Don't You Know I Care


Don't you know I care

Or don't you care to know?

If you know I care

How could you hurt me so?



Darling, you are part

Of every breath I take

Will you break my heart

Or give my heart a break?



I can't figure out what love's all about

And where I fit into your scheme

Am I wasting time? Please tell me

'Cause I'm down to my last dream



Won't you please be fair?

Love me or let me go

Don't you know I care

Or don't you care to know?
