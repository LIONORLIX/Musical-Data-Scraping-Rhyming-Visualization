It Ain't No Thing


(Nautica, La Cienega and Bridget)



Nautica:

There's a saying that I learned

Passed down through centuries

Which translated from the

French means

?sista please!?



Girl, you?re special --

You?re rough, yeah, but you?re

A gem

And if people haven?t seen it

Well, hey! That?s on them!



So, you got a little baby fat --

It ain?t no thing, yeah

Look at Twig! He?s down with that!

It ain?t no thing, yeah!



Why walk around like you?re made of asbestos

When Twig loves your eyes,

Your thighs and your breastes?

So shake like jello on a spring --

It ain?t no thing, yeah!

It ain?t no thing!



La Cienega:

Oh whoa, some kids used to tease me

And put me through hell --

Some people are mean



La cienega/nautica:

But most people mean well

Its just their thinkin? -- is

Stinkin?



La cienega:

And a little outdated

Or maybe they?re merely

Unedumecated!

Got pretty eyes but thunder

Thighs --



It ain?t no thing, yeah!

I?m daddy?s little big surprise!

It ain?t no thing, yeah!



Love who you are

And the world will adore you --

And the couple that don?t

At least they can?t ignore you!

Now boys all want to buy me

Bling --

It ain?t no thing, yeah!



Nautica/ensemble:

Na na na! Hey, hey! Na na na!

Hey, hey!



La cienega:

It ain?t no thing! Yeah!



Ensemble:

Na na na! Hey, hey! Na na na!

Hey, hey!



La cienega:

Dont walk away and leave

Cases unopened

When you?re playing ?deal or no deal?



Ensemble girls:

No deal!



Nautica:

And don?t you just take little

Pieces of life



La cienega/nautica:

Treat yourself to the seven

Course meal!



Bridget:

Oh, oh! I?ve been hatin? on

Myself unnecessarily



Ensemble:

No no no!



Bridet:

I?m feelin? great

Celebratin? me!



Ensemble:

Bridget:

I?ve got a big butt

Well so what?

It?s good as any other

And i think of you as sisters

From another mother!



Yeah i got some junk up in my

Trunk (back it on up!)

It ain?t no thing, yeah!

Twig thinks im sexy -- who?d a

Thunk? (you better think!)

Let freedom ring, yeah!



I?m through hesitating

Time to get off the pot!



All:

You can give love

You can get love

Long as you love what you got!



Bridget:

With tongue

Like i dreamed i?d do

And not just with my pillow

But with you-know-who



Nautica:

Dang!



La cienega:

Band!
