Tryouts


(Performs - Skylar)



I remember my first tryout

And my second and third too

All the fear and holy hell the judges put me through

I felt so belittled

Man, they put me on the rack

And now that I'm a senior, this is my chance to give back



I'll uphold the great tradition

With these young lives on my watch

Let's set the stage, I've come of age

To be a raging, castrating

Biotch, biotch!
