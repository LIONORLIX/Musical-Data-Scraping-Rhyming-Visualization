Bring It On


(Performs - campbell and company)



Campbell:

Gone --

My one chance to shine

The friends i called mine

The girl the world

Will never see

More than replaced

Its like shes erased

The best of me

I have no choice --

Ive got to back

What she stole

Get back my one moment!



Made a vow i was gonna be

A cheerleader like the

Buccaneers in front of me!

Now if only i could find a way

To get back into the nationals

And make her pay!



Campbell:

Nautica!

La cienega!

Danielle!

Jackson?



Ensemble:

Jackson! Go jackson

Go jackson!

Go go go jackson go!

Oh...

Let everybody know

Campbells back --



Campbell:

This is my town!

Oh...



All:

Oh.... And eva's going down!



Voices:

Eva is like the best sweetest

Cheer captain...

I'm in love with eva... Omigod!



Ensemble:

Bring it on! Go!

Bring it on! Go campbell!

Bring it on! Go campbell go!



Campbell:

I'll take first place

And throw it in your face!



Ensemble:

Rrrrrah!



Campbell:

Think you can beat me?

Go ahead c'mon!



Ensemble:

C'mon! C'mon! C'mon!



Campbell:

And once i have my squad

You'll feel the wrath of god --



Ensemble:

So let the doubters

And the haters

And my tears be gone!



Campbell:

I'm gonna bring it on!



Ensemble:

My year! My time!



Campbell:

I'm gonna bring it on!



Ensemble:

My destiny!

Bring it on --



Campbell:

Gonna bring it on!
