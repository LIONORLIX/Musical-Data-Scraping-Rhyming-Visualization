One Perfect Moment


(Performs - Campbell)



I'm not freaking out, I'm really okay

I'm totally chill or I will be someday

'Cause I'm so near the top but there's so many mountains to climb

There are plans to be planned, drills to be drilled

'Cause this dream that I've dreamed is becoming fulfilled

And I plan to enjoy it but right now, I don't have the time



Fade in on Campbell, an average teenager almost grown

Close-up on average grades from the average life she's known

Now zoom in the lens on the rest of her friends as she stay alone

Doing the work, getting it right



'Cause I know we'll have to be practically perfect

So I'll go above and beyond and pull through, this I can do

All that I'm asking is one perfect moment in time



I'm seventeen, there are so many things that I can't control

So I'll go above and beyond and pull through, this I can do

All that I'm asking is one perfect moment in time



I'm seventeen, there are so many things that I can't control

If I start to freak, or feel weak, I focus on just one goal

Turn down the panic, attack this routine like it owns my soul

Turn up the music so loud that it swallows us whole

And then there we are, we burn like a star

We're safe inside the world we know

Then suddenly I'm in prep for the climb and here I go

High in the air, there is a moment just before you start to fall

Live in that one moment



I know that if I can just stick the landing

Then I'll know that somehow my life will be fine

And I'll go through the rest of my life understanding

What it feels like to shine

The future's full of mysteries

So please let this be mine

My one perfect moment in time
