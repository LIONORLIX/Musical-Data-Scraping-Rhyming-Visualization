Danielle:

We aint no cheerleaders

We dont do no favors for no

Football team

You sorority sisters

Singing swishin "rah rah sis

Boom bah" nuh uh!



Nautica and la cienega:

"rah rah blah blah blah"



Danielle:

Sing it wit me if ya feel me

We dont get down with no

Pom-poms --



Nautica and la cienega:

Hell to the naw



Danielle (with nautica and la cienega):

We bust our ass on every

New routine

When we roll through

With our crew

No one can do what we do

Its true --

But we would still do it if

No one was watching



Nautica:

And lets be real who could

Blame them for watching?



Danielle:

When the dj plays our song

And it all goes down

As planned

Were in the pocket

Were poppin and lockin

Your prob'ly go shoppin

With your daddy's credit card

In your hand!



Dance crew girl

Ooooooh!



Danielle (with nautica and la cienega):

You can call us arrogant

But we work for what we have

Call us whatever is

Clever forever

Please but dont you

Ever call us

"rah rah sis boom bah"



Danielle:

You can call your therapist

And complain "those girls aint right" --



Nautica and la cienega:

Aint right!



Danielle (with nautica and la cienega):

Cause every day

We get haters

Who say they can take us

Okay baby if that helps you

Sleep at night

But dont pretend like you

Know me

(you dont know me!)

Or you'll never get the chance



Danielle & dance crew:

Twirl your baton if you wanna

Rond de jambe

At your mommas



Danielle:

Dance crew:

Dance crew:
