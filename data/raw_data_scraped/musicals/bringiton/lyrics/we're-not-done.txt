We're Not Done


(Performs - Danielle and Campbell)



DANIELLE:

It's easy to ignore you

When I see you down the hall

It's easy to be angry

It's easy not to call

To throw away this thing we had

And blame it all on you

It's harder to admit

I miss it too



It's hard when I come up with something new

And I can't show you

It's hard to see you suffering

It's hard because I know you

It's hard to find forgiveness

We've said all there is to say

What sucks is

I don't see another way



The truth is that you're not too proud

to beg or act the fool

The truth is that you're such a dork

you kind of make it cool

The truth is that I like you

The truth is we had fun

What's hard is missing what we had

And knowing we're not done

We're not done



CAMPBELL:

I miss working together, all of us laughing at practice.

I miss you, but I think about myself then and

It's like looking at a whole other person.

I'm not sure I recognize myself.



DANIELLE:

Hi, I'm Danielle. I don't think we've met.



CAMPBELL:

Campbell. Hey. So what happens to us now?



DANIELLE:

We could just wait to graduate

and let the year go by

Or finish what we started

lets do this you and I



When they finally play our song

(imagine the lights)

And we move in perfect time

(in the middle of the crowd)

We're in the pocket

And no one can stop it

We're not gonna drop

And we rock it nobody can stop it

We're not gonna stop

Till we fly

(we're not done)

Till we fly

(we're not done)

Till we fly

We're not done.
