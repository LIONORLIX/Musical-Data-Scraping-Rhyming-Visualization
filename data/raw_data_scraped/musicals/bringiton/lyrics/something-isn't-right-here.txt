Something Isn't Right Here


Campbell (sang):

I put her on the team she was green as she could be,

I took a lot of heat no one wanted her but me,

All my dreams were coming true, i was captain it was cool,

Then im suddenly redist-... redis.. sent to another school,

So skylers next in line but somehow skyler flunks!

So kyler should be captain but kylers blowing chunks,

Is this all coninscidence to some related incident that happened to occur,

Miraculusly making way for her



Something isnt right here, i dont know what it is, none of this should be happening ,

But it is, oh but it is, its like hearing a ticking sound coming from unmarked packages



Campbell(Spoken):

Hang on just one second, ill be right there.



Eva (Spoken): CAMPBELL!



Campbell (spoken): Nice Hair



Eva (spoken): Thanks! you know youve always been my inspiration



Campbell (sang):

Cearly, Something isnt right here, i got a spidy sense,

Too much has been going down to chalk it up to coincidence



Eva (spoken): What coincidence?



Campbell (spoken): that up, a sophmore , suddenly became captian of the squad



Eva (Spoken): what? you think i did all of this on purpose,

i would never take anything away from you



Campbell (spoken) :Steven?



Steven (spoken) :BABY! what are you doing here?



Campbell (sang): something isnt right here



Steven (spoken): baby its no big



Campbell (sang): Something isnt right here



Steven (spoken): Eva\'s helping me with trig



Campbell (sang): youre alibi\'s pathetic im here to call your bluff,

there no way he studies trig, theres no way he cares enough,

made the team and you made captian, now youre all up in his stuff!



Eva (spoken) :Campbell! campbell im your friend



Campbell (spoken): steven i dont think we should see each other for a while.

Like forever while



Steven (spoken): baby What?



Campbell (sang):

She did it, she did it, she came up with a plan to take all that she took,

My team, my school, my man, next she\'ll win the lotto,

Or crap a four leaf clover, can i just eb me who sees how she screwed us over!



Kyler (sang) : so its her fault i got mono, and for Skyler failing too,

and she somehow got you transfered and this whole things about you



Skyler (sang) : yeah our teams without a captian and our chances arent great,

but dont blame it on you mini me she stepped up to the plate



Kyler (sang): shes barely out of diapers



Skyler (sang):an yet youre sure its true



Both Skyler & Kyler (sang):

shes getting with youre man who we all know worships you



Skyler (sang): yeah i see whats wrong unless you have more to tell us



Kyler (sang): youre parinoid



Skyler (sang) : youre crazy



Both Skyler & Kyler (sang): or maybe youre just jealous
