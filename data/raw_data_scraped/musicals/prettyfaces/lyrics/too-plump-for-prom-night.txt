Too Plump For Prom Night


(Michelle Sellers - as - Pleasure)



TOO PLUMP FOR PROM NIGHT

NO DATE FOR THE DANCE

NO ROMANCE BY STAR LIGHT

NOT EVEN A CHANCES

I FILLED OUT A SWEATER

BY TEN INCHES OR BETTER

THAN ANY GIRL IN TOWN



TOO PLUMP FOR PROM NIGHT

NO ORCHID CORSAGE

I SPENT THE NIGHT CRYING

LOCKED IN THE GARAGE

THIS CHUNK-A-RELLA

MET NO PRINCELY FELLA

I HAD NO GORGEOUS GOWN ----------------------------------------



BOYS CAN BE BULLIES

BULLIES CAN BE CRUEL

THEY'LL TALK TO YOU AT LUNCH TIME

BUT WON'T DATE YOU AFTER SCHOOL



TOO PLUMP FOR PROM NIGHT

NO MIDNIGHT KISS

NO MOMENT TO TREASURE

NO MOMENT OF BLISS

IF I WEREN'T ONLY

LEFT SAD AND LONELY

TOO PLUMP FOR PROM NIGHT

WAS NOT A PRETTY SIGHT ----------------------------------------



FAT AND JOLLY, POPULAR

THAT'S YOUR DESTINED FATE

THEY ONLY DATES THAT I COULD GET

WERE CANDIED ON A PLATE



GIRLS



SHE ATE HER DATES

TOO PLUMP FOR PROM NIGHT

NO DATE FOR THE DANCE

NO ROMANCE BY STAR LIGHT

NOT EVEN A CHANCE



PLEASURE



A PIG IN A POKE

MY LIFE WAS A JOKE

STAR LIGHT STAR BRIGHT

WISHED I'D HAD A CHANCE THAT NIGHT

I'LL ALWAYS REGRET IT

I'LL NEVER FORGET IT

TOO PLUMP FOR PROM NIGHT

THE WORST NIGHT

OF MY LIFE--------------------------------------------



GIRLS



PROM NIGHT--------------------------------

SHUT THE DOOR

PACE THE FLOOR

EAT SOME MORE ------------------------!
