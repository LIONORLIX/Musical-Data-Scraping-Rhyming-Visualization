We're Taking Chances


CARTER



WE'RE TAKING CHANCES

TO CHANGE SOME CONCEPTS

AND GIVE THE WORLD A CHANCE

TO CHANGE IT'S ATTITUDE

WE'LL USE SOME COSTUMES, SETS & LIGHTS

TO GIVE THE MOOD

AND CHANGE THE WAY IN WHICH

THESES BEAUTIES HAVE BEEN VIEWED



MONIQUE



WHAT IS TRUE BEAUTY

WHAT'S TRULY LOVELY

IS THE SEED OF PRIDE WE NOURISH DEEP INSIDE

TO BE HAPPY WITH OURSELVES AND NEVER HIDE

AND SEIZE THE MOMENT WHEN IT COMES

TO TURN THE TIDE



GIRLS



SOME HOW THIS STILL DOESN'T SEEM REAL

HALF THE WORLD THINKS WE'VE NO SEX APPEAL

RUDE REMARKS ARE THE USUAL DEAL

WILL THIS SHOW CHANGE HOW ANYONE FEELS



CARTER



WE'RE TAKING CHANCES

TO CHANGE A CONCEPT

WE'D LIKE TO GIVE THE WORLD ANOTHER CHANCE TO SEE

OTHER IMAGES OF FEMININITY

AND SEIZE THE MOMENT TO BE ALL THAT WE CAN BE



MONIQUE



AS I LAY MY CAREER ON THE LINE

ALL MY DOUBTS AND THE FEARS UNDERMINE

ALL THE WORK AND THE STRAIN AND THE GRIND

CAN I REALLY CHANGE ANY ONES MIND



CARTER



THEY'VE ALL BEEN DAMSELS

IN REAL DISTRESS

SOON EACH WILL BE A BEAUTY IN A GORGEOUS DRESS



COMPANY



OPEN YOUR HEARTS

OPEN YOUR MINDS



WE'RE TAKING CHANCES

TO CHANGE CONCEPTIONS

TO SHOW YOU BEAUTY

IN MANY DIFFERENT SHAPES

AND DIFFERENT KINDS-------------------------------------
