Twirling For Jesus


(Amanda  Fackrell - as - Bobby Joy)



WHEN I WAS BUT A TINY TOT UPON MY MAMA'S KNEE

I LEARNED TO SING SWEET JESUS PRAISES TRADITIONALLY

BUT I TOLD MY DARLIN' MOTHER

I KNEW THERE'D COM A DAY

WHEN I'D LEARN TO SING HIS PRAISES

IN MY OWN SPECIAL WAY ----------------------------!



I'M TWIRLING FOR JESUS TO PLEASE THE DIVINE

I TWIRL EVERY SUNDAY AND DRINK SACRED WINE

THE ANGELS ARE WATCHING AS I SPIN AND I TWIRL

I'M TWIRLING FOR JESUS LIKE A GOOD BAPTIST GIRL



I'M TWIRLING FOR JESUS TO SHOW HIM I CARE

I TWIRL OUT HIS PREACHING YE SINNERS BEWARE

OLD SATAN IS HOPING FOR YOUR SOULS TO ENSNARE

I'M TWIRLING TO SAVE YOU! - FROM GOING DOWN THERE



I'M TWIRLING FOR JESUS

I TWIRL ALL AROUND

I'M TWIRLING FOR JESUS

WHERE EVER SINS ARE FOUND



Oh that was real nice Y'all and real special, but hush up now

cause this is my big talent section!



I'M TAPPIN' - (Tap break)

FOR JESUS -  (Tap break)

TO SPREAD HIS -  (Tap break)

GOOD WORD -  (Tap break)

I'M TAPPIN' - (Tap break)

FOR JESUS -  (Tap break)

HIS  GOOD WORD MUST BE HEARD



IF YOU WOULD JUST LISTEN

HIS BLESSING IS ASSURED

I'M TWIRLING FOR JESUS

I'M TAP, TAP, TAPPING FOR JESUS

I'M SINGING FOR JESUS

TO SPREAD----------------------- HIS ------------------------ GOOD

WORD----------------------------------------------------------------------



AMEN!!!!!
