Someone Gets Hurt (Reprise)


JANIS: (spoken)

See? That’s the thing with you Plastics.

You think everybody is in love with you, when actually everybody hates you



CADY: (spoken)

You made me like this. It was your idea for me to pretend to be Plastic!



JANIS:

Buddy, it’s not pretend

You are as plastic as they come

You think your shit don't stink

You think the rest of us are dumb



I hate Regina’s guts

But here’s what you don't comprehend

At least she has the guts

To not pretend to be my friend!



CADY: (spoken)

Janis...



JANIS:

No, it’s fine

Really fine

Go be fine!



DAMIAN:

And I want my pink shirt
