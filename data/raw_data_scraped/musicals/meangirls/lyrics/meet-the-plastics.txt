our

I spend making sure Regina

George can stay in power

If Regina is the sun

Then I'm a disco ball

'Cause I'm just as bright and fun

If you've had alcohol



KAREN:

My name is Karen

My hair is shiny

My teeth are perfect

My skirt is tiny



REGINA, GRETCHEN, KAREN:

Wear something nice and grab a tray

'Cause we don't do this everyday

Say here's where you belong

Say here's where you belong



REGINA: (spoken)

No, really. Say it



REGINA, GRETCHEN, KAREN:

Say here's where you belong!



CADY:

Hereâ€™s where I belong!



GRETCHEN:

Come sit with us tomorrow

It'll be fetch!
