Someone Gets Hurt (Reprise 2)


CADY: (spoken)

Janis, I can’t spend every second with you,

It’s not my fault that you’re like in love with me or something



DAMIAN: (spoken)

Oh, no, she didn’t



JANIS: (spoken)

See? That is the thing with you Plastics.

You think that everyone is in love with you when actually everyone hates you



CADY: (spoken)

You made me like this it was your idea for me to pretend to be Plastic



JANIS: (spoken)

No that’s…

(sung)

Buddy, it’s not pretend

You’re as plastic as they come

You think your shit don't stink

You think the rest of us are dumb



I hate Regina’s guts

But here’s what you can’t comprehend

At least she has the guts to not pretend

To be my friend…

(spoken)

Here have it, it won a prize



CADY: (spoken)

Janis. I…



JANIS:

No. It’s fine

Really fine

We’ll be fine



DAMIAN:

And I want my pink shirt
