What’s Wrong with Me?


GRETCHEN:

(spoken) Regina, let me in. I'm sorry about the car burp

(sung)

Tell me what's wrong with me

My body, face, my hair

Tell me all my many faults

Tell me like you care



When we both know you're cruel

And we both know you're right

I could listen to you, like a fool all night



What's wrong with me?

How I speak?

How I dress?

What's wrong with me?



You keep me guessing

Mama called me beautiful

Don’t believe her anymore

Now I'm listening to you



What do I do that for?

Please don't ignore me

Mmh. Mmh



Tell me who we hate today

And I will fall in line

Hug me though my shoulders tense

And we’ll pretend we’re fine



Though we both know one day

There’ll be blood on the floor

And which one will betray the other more



CADY: (spoken) I have to go home now



GRETCHEN:

(spoken) Okay. Fun. See you tomorrow!

(sung)

What’s wrong with me?

Where’s my mind

Where does it end?

Maybe I need to try to get other friends



What’s wrong with you

What can I do

What’s wrong with me

Could it be you



What’s wrong with me

See that, you see

What’s wrong with me

Mmh. Mmh
