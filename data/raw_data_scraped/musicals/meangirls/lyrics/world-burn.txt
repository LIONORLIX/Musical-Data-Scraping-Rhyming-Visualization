REGINA:

My name is regina george

And I am a massive deal

I will grind you to sand

Beneath my louboutin heels



This is what I get for helping

Helping someone lame fit in

Cady heron, enjoy your temporary win



My name is regina george

“Regina is a fugly cow.”

Hey cady, how do you like me now?

I wanna watch the world burn, i got the gasoline

I wanna watch the world burn and everyone get mean

I wanna watch the world burn, i got the gasoline

I wanna watch the world burn and everyone get…

Does that work? Ms. Norbury is a sad, old drug pusher? What does this say? Caitlyn caussin has what?



REGINA: (spoken) Hairy nips



MR. DUVALL: (spoken) Good lord. Don’t worry, we will find out who did this



REGINA: (spoken) There are only three girls in the school who aren’t in it



MR. DUVALL: (spoken) Can you give me names?



REGINA:

Cady, time to watch your back

Cady, time to turn and walk

Because you took me down

But you didn’t finish me off



My name is regina george

And in case you’re keeping score

Cady may have won the battle

But I will win the world war

I wanna watch the world burn
