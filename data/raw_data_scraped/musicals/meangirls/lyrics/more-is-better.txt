More Is Better


CADY:

I was alone a lot

Mostly observing things

Like hyenas and migrations

And who cares?



Now I have all these friends

I'm never by myself

I mean, look at all those people downstairs

More is always better



More people know my name

I have more shoes

More is always better

Cause when you have less

You have more to lose



Wait, that’s confusing



AARON:

See, I don't mind alone

Sometimes alone is good

‘Cause time to think is in short supply



CADY:

You haven't been alone

Try Kenya with one phone

Almost no people

Just like animals and sky



Do you know what I had more of?

Stars

So many stars at night

But here there's so much light

I see them less now



Plus, I'm always cold because the air-conditioned air

Though in fairness, that could be how I dress now

Whatever, I look cuter

It worked, like pretending I needed a tutor



AARON: (spoken)

Pretending?



CADY: (spoken)

Yeah, I pretended to be bad at math to get you to talk to me



AARON: (spoken)

Why didn’t you just talk to me?



CADY: (spoken)

Because of Regina. Because you were her property…



AARON: (spoken)

Her property?



CADY: (spoken)

No, shut up, not her property…



AARON, spoken]

Don’t tell me to shut up

You are, like, a clone of Regina



CADY: (spoken)

What? No!



(singing)

I am more, I am better

And no one likes you more

Not anyone, not her



More is always better

Don't look at me that way

What girl would you prefer?



AARON:

I would prefer the girl you were

Not who you're trying to be

You think this works with me?

Well, you thought wrong



Looking at this place

I see you trying to erase

What is best about yourself just to belong



You say more is always better

But there is less of you than there was before

So, if more is always better

Then you should have thought it through a bit more



CADY:

I should have thought it through a bit…

You know what I had more of?

Stars…
