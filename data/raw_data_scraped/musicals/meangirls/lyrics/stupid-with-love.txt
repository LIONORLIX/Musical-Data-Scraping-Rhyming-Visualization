Stupid With Love


CADY:

When I was five I fell in love

It didn't last

He ran from me

Literally ran from me

And being Kenyan

He ran fast



AARON (spoken): Mrs. Norbury is tough and a little weird but you get to like her eventually



CADY (spoken): Oh, like snake meat



CADY:

When I was ten in love again

This doctor from France

I waited for hours

Inside his candy flower

But was attacked by fire ants



By thirteen I gave up trying

I decided I would be a mathematician

'Cause math is real

I memorized a lot of pi

Because additions and subtractions and division

Would never make me feel

So stupid with love



Like I didn't get it

I didn't get it somehow

Smart at math and stupid with love

I didn't get it

I didn’t get it

'Till now



AARON (spoken): Do you have an eraser?



CADY (spoken): I would love to



CADY:

So, thank you math for being there

To bring me joy

And thank you math

'Cause now brought me this cute boy



AARON (spoken): Is it two?



CADY (spoken): YES! Wee



CADY:

He's like someone from T.V. he's like that guy who give out roses to those women

His clothes is grooming

And he's not that far away from me with silky hair and shiny eyes that I could swim in,

He's livening the room



And I'm stupid with love

I wanna get it I want to get it, but how?

Smart with math, but stupid with love

I wanna get it I didn't get it 'till now



CADY (spoken)

Two over zero is undefined



AARON (spoken)

Two over zero is undefined Jinx.



CADY (spoken)

Ha!



CADY:

I'm astounded and nonplussed

I am filled with calculust

Does this guy work out?

He must get all sweaty at the gym



Could that image be more hot?

Let me just enjoy that thought

School was tough but now it’s not

'Cause now there’s him. It’s all so simple



Stupid with love but I can get it

Watch this girl self-educate

I learned math so I can learn love



You wanna bet it

That I can get it

Just wait

Just wait

Just wait
