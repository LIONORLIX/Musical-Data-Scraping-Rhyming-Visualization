Do This Thing


KEVIN: (spoken)

Yo yo, Mathletes State Championships, what!

First female ever on the team, what. A boxed lunch will be provided



KEVIN, MARWAN & ROWAN: (spoken)

What!



CADY:

I can do this

Always could

And not playing dumb will feel so damn good

The monster inside needs to be released

Gotta do what I do, gotta feed the beast



MS. NORBURY:

Gotta earn some respect

Grab that big brass ring



CADY & MS. NORBURY:

Let's do this thing



CADY, MS. NORBURY, KEVIN, MARWAN & ROWAN:

Let's do this thing!



KEVIN:

You're gonna roll up, stylin'

Leather on your sleeve

All-state champion, better believe

Maybe the haters gonna make fun of you

All you can solve's the problem in front of you

High school's a four year social curse

But math's the foundation of the...



KEVIN, MARWAN & ROWAN:

Universe!



KEVIN:

So sick of plucking that second string

Then let's…



KEVIN, MARWAN & ROWAN:

Beep!

Do this thing!



CADY, KEVIN, MARWAN & ROWAN:

Do, this thing

Do, this thing



CADY:

I'm no plastic



KEVIN, MARWAN & ROWAN:

No



CADY:

I'm no bitch



KEVIN, MARWAN & ROWAN:

No!



CADY:

I'm



CADY & MS. NORBURY:

A lean, mean math machine

On a mission!



CADY:

I lost what I lost

Got to start brand new



CADY & MS. NORBURY:

Go all in for the win

With a chill, dope crew!

Gotta kick off the dust



CADY:

I got schquillz to thrill



KEVIN:

Schquillz!



CADY:

Let's do this thing!



CADY, KEVIN, MARWAN & ROWAN:

Let's do this thing!



ADJUDICATOR: (spoken)

Welcome to the ICMT State Final Math Championships, sponsored by no one

Please solve for...



KEVIN:

X equals two



MARYMOUNT #1:

The rate is two pi



ROWAN:

X is greater than the value of Y



MARWAN JITLA:

Both polynomials are second degree

So the asymptote is at Y equals three



MARYMOUNT #2:

Function X equals MX plus X



KEVIN:

The derivative of F at argument Z



MARYMOUNT #3:

Negative four



CADY:

Negative two



MARYMOUNT #1:

The slope is zero



CAROLINE KRAFFT:

The answer is true!



MARYMOUNT #3:

One point of inflection



KEVIN:

Twenty-nine!



CADY:

Four is the slope of the tangent line!



ADJUDICATOR: (spoken)

We have a tie. We move into a one on one sudden death round,

In which each team may choose their opponent. Marymount, who do you select?



MARYMOUNT #1: (spoken)

We pick the girl



KEVIN: (spoken)

We pick the girl too



CADY: (spoken)

Nice to meet you



CAROLINE KRAFFT: (spoken)

You’re going down, slut



CADY: (spoken)

What? No!



(sung)

If we break, from this crap

Then the answers land in our lap

Don't be scared, just persist

Then our limit does not exist

No, the limit does not exist!



ADJUDICATOR: (spoken)

Our new state champions: the North Shore Mathletes!



KEVIN: (spoken)

Aw yeah, you like that Marymount?!



CADY & MS. NORBURY:

'Cause don't it feel good

To have gotten this far?

It's not something you did

Not the girls you are

You can hear the fear

Upon your heart just saying

"Just do your thing"



AARON, KEVIN, MARWAN & ROWAN:

All you solve is the problem in front of you



CADY & MS. NORBURY:

Do your thing



CADY, MS. NORBURY, AARON, KEVIN, MARWAN & ROWAN:

Living for me, not dancing for none of you

Do. Your. Thing!

Do your thing
