What’s Wrong With Me (Reprise)


GRETCHEN:

What's wrong with me?

Different boss

Same old song



I try so hard

Is that what's wrong?

It's like all I do is plan

For joy I don't get to feel



I'm whoever you want

Is that my only appeal?

Who am I really?

Hmmm....hmmm…



MRS. GEORGE:

What's wrong with me?

Ask me for help, ask me for hugs

Girl stuff sucks



Why couldn't it just be drugs?

I try to give you love

I try to give you space

You roll your eyes so hard

They're going to roll right off your face



GRETCHEN & MRS. GEORGE:

What's wrong with me?

Why are you mad

Why do we fight?



MRS. GEORGE:

Why can't I?



GRETCHEN:

Why can't I?



MRS. GEORGE:

Do anything right?

Someday, you'll have children too

And then baby, wait and see

You'll be worshiped for years

And then she'll turn three

And everything's…



GRETCHEN & MRS. GEORGE:

Wrong with me

Hmmm...hmmm
