It Roars (Reprise)


CADY:

I'm sixteen, just like everyone here

But I'm not like everyone here.

It's clear

It's gonna be a rough year.



They have codes and social signifiers

That everyone seems to get

But not me.

Not yet.



Did you ever get a feeling,

Expectations need adjusting,

And you need to lick your wounds,

In the ladies bathroom stall?

I'm not quitting.

I'm re-grouping.

I'll just sit and eat my sandwich...



And tomorrow I'll find friends who hear the call

The same call,

That need to belong,

That roars!
