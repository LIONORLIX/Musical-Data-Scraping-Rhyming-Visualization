Revenge Party




JANIS (spoken): No, don’t be sorry. Now you know Regina George is not your friend.

We are your friends. And we are gonna make her pay



JANIS:

You know what friends do?

They’ve got your back

They’re fun to be around



DAMIAN:

Whuh-oh. Whuh-oh. Whuh-oh



JANIS:

When someone hurts you

Then they attack

And grind your foe into the ground



DAMIAN:

Whuh-oh. Whuh-oh. Whuh-oh



JANIS:

Imagine the party with dresses and cake

And singing and dancing and cake

And there’s a magic act

That saws Regina in half

And this time it will take



DAMIAN:

Now that’s a party



JANIS:

A revenge party

A party that ends

With somebody’s head on a spike



DAMIAN:

Whuh-oh. Whuh-oh. Whuh-oh



JANIS & DAMIAN:

It’s a Revenge Party with your two best friends

It’s like a party and revenge it’s what it’s like



JANIS (spoken): I have dreamed of this day for many years,

But I have never had an inside man



DAMIAN (spoken): Ugh, I almost did once as Governor of school, but I got nervous



JANIS (spoken): Alright, if this is gonna work,

You are gonna have to pretend like you still like them, can you do it?



CADY (spoken): Yes. (Gretchen enters) Hey, girl



GRETCHEN (spoken): Hey. Regina wanted me to tell you that she tried to talk to Aaron,

But he just wanted her back and that’s not Regina’s fault



CADY (spoken): No. I get it, I just hope I can still have lunch with you guys



GRETCHEN (spoken): Aw, of course, also Regina wanted me to give you this



DAMIAN (spoken): Ew



JANIS & DAMIAN:

It’s a revenge party

A party that ends with eggshells all over the wall

It’s a revenge party with your two best friends



CADY:

And I end up with Aaron when she’s gone



DAMIAN & JANIS:

Yes, bitch!



CADY:

I end up with Aaron when she’s gone



STUDENTS:

What’s Regina doing?

What is Regina wearing?

Is she dating Aaron?

Regina, Regina she has everything

She gets everything

Regina, Regina, Regina



JANIS (spoken): Now, we take away Regina’s only accomplishments,

Being a hot person



DAMIAN (spoken): Yeah, but how?



CADY (spoken): I know how!



DAMIAN (spoken): Oh, here we go



JANIS, DAMIAN, CADY: KÄLTEEN!



REGINA (spoken): What is that?



CADY (spoken): Ugh, I’m so fat and disgusting.

I just use these Kälteen diet bars when I need to lose weight



REGINA (spoken): I want to lose three pounds. How many calories from fat?



CADY (spoken): Zero. You just cross multiply x over a thousand

And divide it by point three five kilograms



REGINA (spoken): Whatever! Bring me a whole box



JANIS & DAMIAN:

It’s a revenge party

A party that ends with somebody crushed and alone



JANIS:

And ugly crying



JANIS & DAMIAN:

It’s a revenge party with your two best friends

It’s like a party and revenge is what is like



STUDENTS:

What’s Regina eating?

God, look at her figure?

Did her boobs get bigger?

Regina, Regina, Regina, she has everything

She gets everything

Regina, Regina, Regina



JANIS (spoken): We’ve got to go harder.

If we could get Gretchen Wieners to think that Regina is mad at her



CADY (spoken): No. No, I can’t do that, Gretchen is fragile



JANIS (spoken): Exactly, if we crack her she will spill something we could use.

Shh, here she comes



CADY (spoken): Hey, girl, are you sending any candy canes?



REGINA (spoken): I don’t send them, I just get them. Stop pulling it down,

Your hair looks sexy push back. Cady, please tell Aaron that his hair looks sexy push back



CADY (spoken): Your hair looks sexy push back



AARON (spoken): Um, thanks. I’ll see you in Cal



JANIS:

At every party, there might be a low

Where the energy dips



DAMIAN:

WHUH-OH. WHUH-OH. WHUH-OH

You might be thinking it’s late we should go

And they ran out of chips



CADY:

No. No. No

I can’t even watch when she touches his hair

And I’ve watched a snake eat a cow

Regina needs to be taught

Sorry, Gretchen, I swear that I’m parting now

A candy cane, please



CADY, DAMIAN, JANIS:

A revenge party!

A party that ends with lions in a roman arena



STUDENTS:

She has everything

She gets everything

Regina, Regina, Regina



DAMIAN (spoken): Ho, Ho, Ho. One candy cane gram for Shane Omen



STUDENTS:

She gets everything



DAMIAN (spoken): One for Caddy Heron



STUDENTS:

She gets everything



DAMIAN (spoken): Four for Glen Coco, you go Glen Coco



STUDENTS:

Glen Coco. Glen Coco. Glen Coco



DAMIAN (spoken): And none for Gretchen Wieners, bye



GRETCHEN (spoken): Who sent that?



CADY (spoken): Aw. It’s from…



STUDENTS:

Regina! Regina! Regina!



CADY (spoken): Thanks for being a such a great best friend



GRETCHEN (spoken): Caulk! Caulk! Caulk! I mean cute. Gimme it. I mean… okay, well,

If you and Regina are best friends now you can be in charge of keeping all her secrets.

For example, she bought you those high heel shoes just

To make fun of you ‘cause she knew you wouldn’t be able to walk in them.

And she’s not really blonde, her natural color is dark blond,

Also she told me she cheats on Aaron every Thursday she says she has SAT Prep but really,

She’s hooking up with Shane Oman in the North Shore Lion’s Costume



CADY (spoken): She makes him wear the costume?



GRETCHEN (spoken): NO, THEY’RE BOTH IN THE COSTUME!

And I’ve never told anybody because I’m such a good friend



JANIS, CADY, DAMIAN:

It's a Revenge Party

A party that ends with somebody's head on the spike

It's a Revenge Party

With your two best friends

It's like a party

And revenge it's what it's done



STUDENTS:

She gets everything

She gets everything

She gets everything

She gets everything



ALL:

A party where everything is what it’s like

A party where everything is what it’s like

A party where revenge

Is what is like
