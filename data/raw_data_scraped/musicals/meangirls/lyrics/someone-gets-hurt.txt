Someone Gets Hurt


REGINA:

Yes, I look perfect

Ice Queen, that's what they see

It's what they expect from me

But it's all show



Face it, you used me

You saw my sexy clothes

My supermodel pose

But did you know?



Was I a game to you?

Was I way too cool?

I truly cared

Was I the fool?



It's fine for you

It's fine to flirt

It's fine

'Till someone gets hurt

'Till someone gets hurt!



Feel my heart beating?

I'm just like her or you

People forget I'm human too

Yes, they do that



This is performance

This is all self defense

I thought you had the sense

To see through that



Was I too proud of you?

Was I too cold and forbidding?

And you chose her over me

Are you kidding?



BOYS:

Are you kidding?



REGINA:

Poor little me

All trapped in this fabulous show

You could set me free

But if you wanna go



BOYS:

Go! Oh! Oh!



REGINA:

It's fine for you

It's fine to play

And God you're hot

Why do you even wear a shirt?



REGINA & AARON:

It's fine!



AARON:

Damn you're fine!



REGINA:

Damn you're fine!



REGINA & AARON:

And It's fine!



REGINA:

Until someone gets...



ENSEMBLE:

Hurt! Hurt!



REGINA:

'Till someone gets hurt!

'Till someone gets hurt!
