It Roars


CADY:

I’m sixteen living in paradise

The lions and birds and stuff

But I’m sixteen and it’s not enough



I’m alone, I mean, there’s mom and dad

And the animals become serve

But frankly they’re all on my last nerve



Nobody on the savanna understands

None of my closest friends even has hands

I’ve got dreams exciting me

A fire igniting me

I tried to confide in my lions

But they keep biting me



Did you ever get a feeling

Everybody else is happy

Everybody else has friends

And they’re better friends than yours



It’s a very recent feeling

But it’s running through my body

And it roars

It roars



MRS.HERON: (spoken)

Cady, honey, have a Kälteen bar if you’re going to skip dinner



MR. HERON:

Betsy, I’ve got some bad news, we lost our funding and we’re going to have to back to the US



CADY:

America? Maybe can meet an obese person



MRS. HERON:

I know it’ll be a difficult adjustment, you’ll have to go to a real school



CADY: (spoken)

Real school



CADY:

Mom, I love that it’s time for something new

We live in a tent

And nature is what we do

I’ve got no time to cry

I got new things to try

Like, high school, and skateboard and rapping

And Starbucks Venti Chi



MR.HERON:

Chicago has both Starbucks and rapping



MRS.HERON:

Chicago, it is



CADY:

Did you ever get a feeling

That a whole new world is waiting

Bringing happiness and friends

To greatest nearest floor

It’s a scary kind of feeling, but it’s so exhilarating

How it roars

It roars

It roars



CADY: (spoken)

Could you tell me where the cafeteria is?



MALE STUDENT:

I could



CADY:

I’m a little lost



FEMALE STUDENT:

Try Google Maps



CADY: (spoken)

Okay, maybe they didn’t see me

Staring at their little screens

Plus, it’s crowded

With all those teens

Hi, teens!



FEMALE STUDENT (spoken)

Unsubscribe



CADY:

They’re tough. Challenge accepted

I’m trying to fit into a pack

Like baboons, it’s natural they attack

I got to fight for the right to belong



STUDENTS:

Somebody doesn’t fit



CADY:

They want to be included like me

So eventually

I will



STUDENTS:

You can ignore her

Just ignore her



STUDENTS:

Do you ever get a feeling?



CADY:

Everybody wants connection

Yes, I know they have their friends, but what is one friend more



STUDENTS:

No!



CADY:

'Cause I know, I know this feeling

So I brush off their rejection at our core

You can't ignore

Roar



STUDENTS:

I know, I know this feeling

Just ignore her

Just ignore her

Roar. Roar. Roar. Roar.



MR.DUVALL: (spoken)

Welcome to North Shore High!
