Stupid With Love (Reprise)


AARON:

It’s all on me

With her I tried to be somebody cool



CADY: (spoken)

You’re already cool



AARON: (spoken)

Um. Thanks

(sung) That’s love, I guess

You try hard to impress but end up acting like a tool

I find the whole thing so frustrating



CADY:

Sounds frustrating



AARON:

So, I’m swearing off dating



CADY: (spoken)

Shit



AARON:

I just get



BOTH:

Stupid with love



AARON:

I just don't get it



CADY:

I'll never get it



AARON:

I just don't get



CADY:

I just don’t get it



AARON:

I’ll never get



BOTH:

How?

All I get is stupid with love



AARON:

I just don’t get it



CADY:

I’ll never get it



AARON: (spoken)

You’ll never get what?



CADY: (spoken)

What? Umm. Eee. This problem



AARON: (spoken)

It’s a factorial, you multiply it



CADY: (spoken)

Ooh, thanks. You’re so smart



JANIS: (spoken)

Okay, don't sleep on that. She just pretended to be dumb to get a boy to keep talking to her.

And it worked. 'Cause that shit always works



AARON: (spoken)

Hey, we’re having a party at my friend Chris’ this weekend, you wanna come?



CADY: (spoken)

Me?



AARON: (spoken)

Yeah, it’s a Halloween costume party, people really get into it



CADY: (spoken)

Grool. I meant to say “great” and then I started to say “cool”



AARON: (spoken)

Okay, grool



CADY:

Stupid with love

But now I get it

Both we finally found a way

Acting dumb times x equals love



AARON: (spoken)

Hey, what’s the date?



CADY:

October third

My new favorite day
