I See Stars


CADY:

Crown. Right

Here, in this light?

It could be platinum

Actually it’s kind of dumb

(spoken)

We could really just share it

(sung)

Cheap. Fake

Easy to break

That’s how i used to be



Here. Take it

Now i’m awake

I’ll tell you what i see



Plastic don’t shine

Glitter don’t shine

Rhinestones don’t shine

The way you do



You are so real

You are so rare

I see you there – I see you



I see stars

So many stars tonight

You could make diamonds dull

You are so beautiful



I see stars

You shine as bright as day

I will look out for you

We’ll light each other’s way

You’re all stars



See, I will not hide

That was my problem, I…

Don’t be frightened like me

The darker the night

The brighter you shine



Plastic don’t shine

Glitter don’t shine

Rhinestones don’t shine

The way you do



You are on fire

You can rise higher

Up in the sky

Enjoy the view

You stars!



So many stars tonight

You could make diamonds dull

You are so beautiful

I see stars



You are real

And you are rare

I want to say

I see you there

It’s me and you

Not us and her

Cause if we knew



CADY, REGINA, GRETCHEN & KAREN:

How strong we were



CADY:

We’d say what we are



ENSEMBLE:

Stars!



CADY, REGINA, GRETCHEN & KAREN:

Say what you are!



ALL:

We’re stars!

We’re all stars!

So many stars tonight

You’re making diamonds dull

You are so beautiful

I see stars



We shine as bright as day

I will look out for you

We’ll light each other’s day

I see stars



I see stars

So many stars tonight

You could make diamonds dull

You are so beautiful

I see stars



We shine as bright as day

I will look out for you

We’ll light each other’s way

We are so real

We are so rare



We see you there, we see you

We’re all stars!

We’re all stars!

So many stars!

So many stars!
