You'll Be in My Heart


I gotcha ya, i'll right here unless

Come stop your crying,

It'll be all right

Just take my hand

Hold it tight now

I will protect you

From all around you

I will be here don't you cry



For one so small

You seem so strong now

My arms will hold you

Keep you safe and warmness

Bond between us

Can't be broken

Said wanna be here

Don't you cry



'Cause you'll be in my heart

You'll be in my heart yeahhh

From this day on

Now and forever more, for more



Why can't they understand

The way we feel

They just don't trust

What they can't explain

I don't see the different

But deep inside us

We're not that different at all



You'll be in my heart

Said you'll be in my heart

From this day on

Now and forever more...

you'll be in my heart

No matter what they say

you'll be right here in my heart always

Always! always, always(3)



Don't listen to them

'Cause what do they know (what do they know)

We need each other

have, to hold

They'll see in time

I know, will show them together



When destiny calls you

You must be strong (you gotta be strong)

I may not be with you

But you got to hold on

They'll see in time

I know

We'll show them together!



'Cause you'll be in my heart (Believe me)

You'll be in my heart (I'll be there)

From this day on

Now and forever more

You'll be in my heart (you'll be here in my heart)

No matter what they say (I'll be with you)

You'll be here in my heart (I'll be there)

Always



Always!

I'll be with you!

I'll be there for you always

Always and always

Just look over your shoulder

Just look over your shoulder

Just look over your shoulder

I'll be there always
