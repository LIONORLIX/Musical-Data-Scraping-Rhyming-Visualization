The Work Song


[Cinderella:]

Cinderella, Cinderella

All I hear is Cinderella, from the moment I get up

till shades of night are falling

There isn't any letup, I hear them calling, calling

Go up and do the attic and go down and do the cellar, you can do them

both together

"Cinderella."



How lovely it would be

if I could live in my fantasy

But in the middle of my dreaming

they're screaming

at me

Cinderella



[Jack:]

Every time she'd find a minute

That's the time that they begin it

Cinderelly, Cinderelly



[Stepsisters:] Cinderella!



[Jack:]

Cinderelly, Cinderelly

Night and day it's Cinderelly

Make the fire, fix the breakfast

Wash the dishes, do the mopping



[Girl mice:]

And the sweeping and the dusting

They always keep her hopping



[Jack:]

She goes around in circles

Till she's very, very dizzy

Still they holler



[Girl mice:]

Keep a-busy Cinderelly!

We can do it, we can do it

We can help our Cinderelly

We can make her dress so pretty

There's nothing to it, really

We'll tie a sash around it

Put a ribbon through it

When dancing at the ball

She'll be more beautiful than all

In the lovely dress we'll make for Cinderelly



Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry

Gonna help our Cinderelly

Got no time to dilly-dally

We gotta get a-goin'



[Gus:]

I'll cut with these scissors!



[Jack:]

And I can do the sewing!



[Girl Mouse:]

Leave the sewing to the women

You go get some trimmin'

And we'll make a lovely dress for

Cinderelly!



[Girl mice and Gus:]

We'll make a lovely dress for

Cinderelly!
