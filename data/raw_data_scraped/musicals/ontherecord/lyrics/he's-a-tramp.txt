He's a Tramp


What a dog!

What a dog!



He's a tramp

But I love him

Breaks a new heart every day



He's a tramp

They adore him

And I only hope he'll stay that way



He's a tramp

He's a scoundrel

He's a rounder

He's a cad

He's a tramp

But I love him

Yes, and even I have got it pretty bad



You can never tell when he'll show up

He gives you plenty of trouble

I guess he's just a no-'count pup

But I wish that he were double



He's a tramp

He's a rover

And there's nothing more to say

If he's a tramp he's a good one

And I wish that I could travel his way

Wish that I could travel his way

Wish that I could travel his way
