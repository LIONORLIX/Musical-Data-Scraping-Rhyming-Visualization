Kiss the Girl


Sebastien:(spoken)

Eef you want somet'in done, you gotta do eet yoaself

Percussion,

Strings,

Winds,

Words



There you see her

Sitting there across the way

She don't got a lot to say,

But there's something about her.

And you don't know why,

But you're dying to try

You wanna,

Kiss the girl

Yes, you want her

Look at her you know you do

Possible she wants you too,

there is one way to ask her.

It don't take a word,

Not a single word, go on and

Kiss the Girl (sing wit' me now)



Frogs & Sebastien:

Sha la la la la la

My oh my

Look like the boy too shy

He ain't gonna kiss the girl

Sha la la la la la

Ain't that sad

Ain't it a shame, too bad

You're gonna miss the girl,



(dialogue)



Sebastien:

Now's your moment

(ya ya)

Floating in a blue lagoon

(ya ya ya)

Boy you better do it soon

No time will be better

(ya ya ya ya ya)

She don't say a word

And she won't say a word until you, kiss the girl



Sha la la la la la

Don't be scared

You've got the mood prepared

Go on and kiss the girl

Sha la la la la la

Don't stop now

Don't try to hide it how, you wanna

Kiss the girl (woah-woah!)

Sha la la la la la

Float along, and listen to the song

The song say, kiss the girl

Sha la la la la

The music play

Do what the music says

You gotta, kiss the girl



You gotta ( to fade)
