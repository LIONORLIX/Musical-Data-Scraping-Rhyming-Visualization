Can You Feel the Love Tonight / I Won't Say I (I'm in Love) / Let's Get Together


Can you feel the love tonight

the peace the evening brings

the world for once

in perfect harmony

with all it's living things

Can you feel the love tonight

you needn't look to far

stealing through/ the nights uncertainty

love is where we are



No chance/ no way/ I won't say I'm in love



You swoon you sigh why deny it uh oh



it's to cliche/ I won't say I'm in love



Shoowap shop/ a shoop shoop ah



I thought my heart had learned it's lesson

it feels so good when you start out/ my head is screaming



get a grip boy



unless your dyin



to cry your heart out



You keep on denyin/ who you are and how your feelin/

baby we're not buyin/ hun we saw ya hit the ceiling/

face it like  a grown up/ when ya gonna own up/ thatcha got



got it



got it bad



oh whoa/ no chance no way/ I won't say it



he won't say it no



get off my case/ I won't say it



boy don't be proud/ it's ok your in love



oh at least out loud/ I won't say I'm



in love



let's get together/ ya ya ya/ why don't you and I combine/ lets get togeter/

whatdya say/ we could have a swingin time/

we'd be a crazy team/ why don't we make the scene/

together ya ya ya/ oh I really think your swell/ uh oh/

we really ring the bell/ oo ee/ and if you stick with me nothing could be greater/

say hey alligator



lets get together



no chance/ no way



two is twice as nice as one



I won't say I'm in love



lets get together



it's to cliche



we'll be havin twice the fun



I won't say I'm in love



And you can always count on me



my head is screamin get a grip



a groovey twosome we will be



boy



together
