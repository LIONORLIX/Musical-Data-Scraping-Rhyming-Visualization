Someday My Prince Will Come / Once Upon a Dream


Someday my prince will come,

someday I'll find my love.

And how thrilling that moment will be

when the prince of my dreams comes to me.

He'll whisper, "I love you",

and steal a kiss or two.

Though he's far away, I'll find my love someday,

Someday when my dreams come true.

Someday my prince will come,

someday I'll find my love.

And how thrilling that moment will be

when the prince of my dreams comes to me.

I know you, I walked with you once upon a dream.

I know you, the gleam in your eyes is so familiar a gleam.

Yet I know it's true that visions are seldom all they seem

But if I know you, I know what you'll do,

You'll love me at once

the way you did once upon a dream.

He'll whisper, "I love you", and steal a kiss or two

But if I know you, I know what you'll do!

You'll love me at once, the way you did once

(Someday...) Once upon a dream (When my dreams...)

Come true.
