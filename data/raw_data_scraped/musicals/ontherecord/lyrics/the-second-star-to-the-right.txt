The Second Star to the Right


JULIAN

The Second Star to the Right

Shines in the night for you

To tell you that the dreams you plan

Really can come true

The Second Star to the Right

Shines with a light that's rare

And if it's Neverland you need

Its light will lead you there

Twinkle, twinkle, little star

So I'll know where you are

Gleaming in the skies above

Lead me to the one who loves

COMPANY

And when our journey is through

Each time we say goodnight

We'll thank the little star that shines

The second from the right

NICK

A Whole New World...

KRISTEN

My heart has wings

NICK

That's where I'll be

DIANE

You can fly!

JULIAN

I'll think the little star that shines

The Second from the right!
