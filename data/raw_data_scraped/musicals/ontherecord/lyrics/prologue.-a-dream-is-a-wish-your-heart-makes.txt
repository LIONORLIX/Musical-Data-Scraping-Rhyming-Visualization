Prologue. A Dream Is a Wish Your Heart Makes


KRISTEN

A Dream is a Wish Your Heart Makes

When you're fast asleep

In dreams, you will lose your heart aches.

Whatever you wish for you keep.

Have faith in your dreams and someday,

Your rainbow will come smiling through.

No matter how your heart is grieving

If you keep on believing,

The dream that you wish will come true.
