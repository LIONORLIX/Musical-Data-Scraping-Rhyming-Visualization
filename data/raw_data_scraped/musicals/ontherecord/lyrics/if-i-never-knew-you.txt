If I Never Knew You


If I Never Knew You



If I never knew you

If i never felt this love

I would have no inkling of

How precious life can be



And if I never held you

I would never have a clue

How at last I'd find in you

The missing part of me.



In this world so full of fear

Full of rage and lies

I can see the truth so clear

In your eyes

So dry your eyes



And I'm so grateful to you

I'd hve lived my whole life through

Lost forever

If I never knew you



If I never knew you

I'd be safe but half as real

Never knowing I could feel

A love so strong and true



I'm so grateful to you

I'd have lived my whole life through

Lost forever

If I never knew you



I thought our love would be so beautiful

Somehow we'd make the whole world bright

I never knew that fear and hate could be so strong

all they'd leave us were these wispers in the night

But still my heart is saying we were right



Oh if I never knew you

There's no moment I regret

If i never felt this love

Since the moment that we met

I would have no inkling of

If our time has gone too fast

How precious life can be...

I've lived at last...



I thought our love would be so beautiful

Somehow we'd make the whole world bright

I thought our love wuold be so beautiful

We'd turn the darkness into light

And still my heart is saying we were right

we were right



And if I never knew you

If I never knew you

I'd have lived my whole life through

Empty as the sky

Never knowing why

Lost forever

If I never knew you
