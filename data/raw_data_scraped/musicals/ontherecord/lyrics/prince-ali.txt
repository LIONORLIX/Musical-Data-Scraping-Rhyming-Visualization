Prince Ali


QUARTET

Hey! Clear the way in the old Bazaar!

Hey you! Let us through, it's a bright new star oh

Come be the first on the block to meet his eye

Make way! Here he comes!

Rings bells! Bang the drums!

Are you gonna love this guy!

DIANE

Prince Ali, fabulous he, Ali Ababwa

Genuflect, show some respect, down on one knee

Now try your best to stay calm

Brush up your Sunday salaam

Then come and meet his spectacular coterie!

ALL

Prince Ali, handsome is he, Ali Ababwa

DIANE

That physique, how can I speak weak in the knee?

Well get on out in that square

Adjust your veil and prepare

To gawk and grovel and stare at Prince Ali

COMPANY

Make way for Prince Ali!
