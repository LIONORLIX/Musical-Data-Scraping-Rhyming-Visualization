The Walrus and the Carpenter / I Wan'na Be Like You


The time has come, the walrus said

to talk of other things.

Of shoes and ships and sealing wax

of cabbages and kings.

And why the sea is boiling hot,

and whether pigs have wings.

Calloo-callay, no work today,

we're cabbages and kings!

Calloo-callay, no work today,

we're cabbages and kings!

Well, I'm the king of the swingers, oh, the jungle VIP.

I've reached the top, had to stop,

that's what's bothering me.

I wanna be a man man-cub and stroll right into town.

And be just like the other men,

I'm tired of monkeying round.

Oh, oobee-doo. I wanna be like you.

I wanna walk l,ike you, talk like you too.

You'll see it's true, an ape like me

can learn to be human too.

I'll ape your mannerisms,

we'll be a set of twins.

No one will know where mancub ends and orangutan begins.

When you eat bananas,

don't peel 'em with your feet.

You'll become a man mancub, and learn some etiquette.

Here we go! A bop bop beroni...[scat]

You-oo-oo. I wanna be like you.

I wanna walk like you, talk like you too.

You'll see it's true,

an ape like me can learn to be like someone like you.

One more time!

Can learn to be like someone like you.

Swingin' mancub.

Can learn to be like someone like you-oo-oo. Oobee doo!
