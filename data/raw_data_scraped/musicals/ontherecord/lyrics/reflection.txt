Reflection


look at me

i will never pass for a perfect bride, or a perfect daughter

can it be im not ment to play this part

now i see that if i were truely to be myself

i would break my familys heart



Who is that girl I see

staring straight back at me?

Why is my reflection someone i dont know

some how i can not hide

who i am, though i've tried

when will my reflection show who i am inside

when will my reflection show who i am inside
