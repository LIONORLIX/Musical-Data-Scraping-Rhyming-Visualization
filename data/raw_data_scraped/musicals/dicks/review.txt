Dicks Review - Broadway musical
From the director of Borat and the producers of The Greatest Showman, now comes A24’s most surprising project in its overall project lineup, Dicks: The Musical. This unique comedy-musical marks A24's first foray into this genre, injecting a refreshing twist into the traditional twins trope. The Larry Charles-directed film stars Aaron Jackson and Josh Sharp, two very upbeat and astoundingly arrogant businessmen who find out that they’re “identical” twins (they’re not identical).



A loving homage to the nostalgic film The Parent Trap, the film follows the misadventures of the two long-lost twins as they endeavor to reunite their eccentric parents. What happens next is a repertoire of high-octane show tunes featuring catchy musical numbers that will have audiences tapping their feet along to the rhythm. With Broadway-style dancing and a cast of eccentric characters, the film’s tantalizing premise guarantees a musical unlike any other.
