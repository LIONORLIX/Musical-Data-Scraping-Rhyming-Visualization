Lonely


(Verse)

[EVELYN]

The phone it never rings

The door it never knocks

I fiddle with my bric-a-brac

My tchotchkes and my clocks



I don't think it's a problem

That I hate to go outside

But I worry it'll take them a week

To find my body once I've died



(Chorus)

I'm lonely



[HARRIS]

I'm lonely, I'm lonely, I'm lonely

I'm lonely



[EVELYN]

So lonely



[HARRIS]

So fuckin' lonely all the time



[BOTH]

I am a person



[EVELYN]

Who's lonely



(Verse 2)

[HARRIS]

My Sewer Boys

They bring me joy

They have throughout the years

But I admit they've scar?d away

My wife, my son, my peers



Could it be I've hid b?hind

My sweet delightful pets?

That they mired me in crippling debt

And been the cause of my death threats



(Chorus)

I'm lonely



[EVELYN]

I'm lonely, I'm lonely, I'm lonely



[HARRIS]

So lonely



[EVELYN]

I'm lonely from being alone

[BOTH]

I am a person



(Bridge)

[EVELYN]

Who threw away the marriage that I had



[HARRIS]

I split my children up, is there a chance that that was bad?



[EVELYN]

That was bad



[BOTH]

And I want to live my life the way I do now

Should I try to change (yes!) some way somehow

I have so much to share

Does anybody care?

Please God, if you're listening, just trust me, I'm Christian, now answer my motherfucking prayer



Maybe my son was right

Maybe tomorrow night

Should I go to Le Chateau?



(Chorus)

[HARRIS]

I'm lonely

[EVELYN]

I'm so lonely



[HARRIS]

So lonely



[EVELYN]

Oh no, you gotta love



[HARRIS]

So lonely



[EVELYN]

I'm lonely



[HARRIS]

Very lonely



[EVELYN]

You know I'm lonely



[BOTH]

I am a person who's



[HARRIS]

Lonely



[EVELYN]

Lonely



[HARRIS]

Lonely



[EVELYN]

Lonely



[BOTH]

Lonely
