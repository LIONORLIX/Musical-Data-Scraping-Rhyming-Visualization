I'll Always Be On Top


(Song)

[CRAIG]

I got a mansion in the Hamptons, I got a bungalow upstate

I got a penthouse just for fuckin' and another where I masturbate

The money just keeps rollin’ in, the good times never stop

There's never been a man like me, and I'll always be on top



[TREVOR]

My cock is fuckin’ massive, it always makes the ladies sore

It's 10 inches long, curves to the left, then it goes 10 inches more

I got girls and cash, cars and booze, I'm the cream of the fuckin' crop

There's never been a man like me, and I'll always be on top



[BOTH]

I'm the best

So fucking blessed



[CRAIG]

Sexy, smart, it's just not fair



[TREVOR]

Pussy, pussy everywhere



[BOTH]

I get what I want, and what I’ve got I want

And those people think it’s strange

No one's gonna make me change



(Spoken)

[CRAIG]

Craig Tittle!



[TREVOR]

Trevor Brock!



[CRAIG]

Take it you’re here from the uptown branch?



[TREVOR]

My reputation precedes me! Nope, never heard of you



[CRAIG]

Actually, I'm the one who's never heard of you, so...



[TREVOR]

Well, you shoulda heard of me, 'cause I’m the Number 1 salesman this company's got



[CRAIG]

Hate to break it to you, buddy, but last time I checked, I was Number 1. Craig Tittle's always on top



[TREVOR]

You might be on top of a sex offender's registry, but I'm always the best salesman



[CRAIG]

Fuck you, pal! I've had a record month! While you've been in bed milking your morning wood, I've been pounding the pavement making sales!

[TREVOR]

You think I can't make sales and jerk off at the same time? You got another thing coming, because



(Song)

[BOTH]

I always get the things I want, there's no way I can flop

There's never been a man like me, and I'll always be

I'll always be

I'll always be on top



[OFFICE WORKERS]

Craig Tittle's fucking awesome, Trevor Brock is off the chart

They talk a lot about their dicks and they sell fucking Vroomba parts



[BOTH]

You will never take me down, I'll work until I drop

There's never been a man like me, and I'll always be on top



[CRAIG]

Fifteen thousand gears!



[OFFICE WORKERS]

Money money money money money money money money



[TREVOR]

Twenty thousand wheels!

[OFFICE WORKERS]

Money money money money money money money money



[CRAIG]

Thirty thousand gears!



[TREVOR]

Forty thousand wheels!



[GLORIA]

I love fuckin' money!



[OFFICE WORKERS]

Who's it gonna be? Who's it gonna be? Who's it gonna be? Who's it gonna be?



[BOTH]

One hundred thousand teeny tiny brushes!



(Dance break)



[BOTH]

Look around, it's plain to see

There's never been a man like me

'Cause I'm the fucking top!
