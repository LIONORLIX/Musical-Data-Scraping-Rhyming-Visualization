No One Understands


(Spoken Intro)

[TREVOR]

Dammit, we look alike!



[CRAIG]

We do not! You have long hair like a girl!



[TREVOR]

You have short hair like a lesbian girl! This haircut is classic Trevor! Fuck you!



[CRAIG]

No, fuck you! You don't get me!



[TREVOR]

You don't get me, either! No one does!



(Song)

[CRAIG]

I'm in this struggle all alone

I don't know what to do



[TREVOR]

I wish that there was someone who knew

What I am going through



[CRAIG]

This feeling that I'm feeling

It feels so very bad



[TREVOR]

It's almost like my life's a lie

And actually I'm sad



[BOTH]

No one understands what I've been through

No one knows what it's like to be

A man with my specific life saying these specific words

The only one who und?rstands is me



(Spoken)

[TREVOR]

Say, is this your family?



[CRAIG]

What? No! But I definit?ly have a real family. and they're rich and smart and kind and real



[TREVOR]

Oh, me too! I got a birth mommy and a birth daddy the same as everybody else



(Song)

Growing up with just a mom, it left a gaping hole



[CRAIG]

My single dad, he did his best, but life, she took her toll

[TREVOR]

With Pops, I could have fished for fish. A fastball we'd perfect



[CRAIG]

With Mom, I could have learned to bake or show women respect



[BOTH]

No one understands what I've been through

No one knows what it's like to be

A man with my specific life saying these specific words

The only one who understands is me



[CRAIG]

If you think I've had it easy, then you're wrong



[TREVOR]

The road's been fuckin' hard and fuckin' long



[BOTH]

Everything I ever got, I got all on my own

I rose up from the ashes of my single-parent home

'Cause I've always been a fighter since the day that I was born

On January 3rd, 1986 at 5:06/5:07 A.M



(Spoken)

[CRAIG]

Wait, what the fuck, dude?

[TREVOR]

Yeah, there are a lot of similarities happening here



[CRAIG]

What is that?



[TREVOR]

This? Oh, the only thing I have from the dad I never knew is



[BOTH]

Half of a locket!



[CRAIG]

This is the only thing I have from my mom. I've never understood mine, it just says "OUR BO". I think it must be an ancient indigenous saying



[TREVOR]

Mine only says "TOYS."



[CRAIG]

Huh, but what if?



[BOTH]

OUR TWO BOYS!



[TREVOR]

Oh my God! Does this mean



[CRAIG]

I'm sorry, you thought that said "TOYS"?



[TREVOR]

Yeah, T-W-O-Y-S, toys!



[CRAIG]

No, there's not a "W" in "toys."



[TREVOR]

Dammit all the fuck, Craig. Who cares about letters right now? You only have a dad, I only have a mom. We're born on the same day almost down to the minute. We must be brothers! Not just brothers, twins!



[CRAIG]

Wow, we're twins!



[BOTH]

We're fucking identical twins!



(Song)

[BOTH]

No one understands what I've been through

No one knows what it's like to be



[TREVOR]

A man who thought he was alone



[CRAIG]

But then found out he had a twin



[TREVOR]

Who works at the same fucking job



[BOTH]

What a big coincidence

The only one who understands is we

Is we
