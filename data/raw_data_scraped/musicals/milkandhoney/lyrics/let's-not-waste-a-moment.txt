Let's Not Waste a Moment


Let's not waste a moment,

Let's not lose a day;

There's a short forever,

Not too far away.



We don't have to hear the clock remind us

That there's more than half of life behind us,

When you face a short forever.

There's no right or wrong;

I can only face forever,

If you come along.

I can only find my way,

If you're there to lead me on;

So let's not waste a moment,

Oh, look, another moment's gone!
