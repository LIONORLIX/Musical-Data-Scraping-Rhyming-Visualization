Shalom


Shalom, Shalom,

You'll find Shalom

The nicest greeting you know;

It means bonjour, salud, and skoal

And twice as much as hello.

It means a million lovely things,

Like peace be yours,

Welcome home.

And even when you say goodbye,

You say goodbye with Shalom.



It's a very useful word,

It can get you through the day;

All you really need to know,

You can hardly go wrong,

This is your home as long as you say:

Shalom,

The nicest greeting I know;

Shalom,

Means twice as much as hello.

It means a million lovely things,

Like peace be yours,

Welcome home.

And even when you say goodbye,

If your voice has

"I don't want to go" in it,

Say goodbye with a little "hello" in it,

And say goodbye with shalom.



It's the most amazing thing

That I think I've ever heard

???



Shalom, Shalom,

I find Shalom

The nicest greeting you know;

It means bonjour, salud, and skoal

And twice as much as hello.

It means a million lovely things,

Like peace be yours,

Welcome home.

And even when you say goodbye...

If your voice has

"I don't want to go" in it,

Say goodbye with a little "hello" in it,

And say goodbye with shalom.
