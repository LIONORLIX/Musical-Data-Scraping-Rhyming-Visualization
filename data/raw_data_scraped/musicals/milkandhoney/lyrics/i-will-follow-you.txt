I Will Follow You


In my gray flannel suit,

In my new, shiny car,

In my split level house,

With my big, black cigar,

Can't you picture me?



I will follow you,

I will follow you

To what may be a strange and a lone world.

For I know I'd be lost in my own world,

If you're not part of it too.



I will follow you,

I am ready to go

Wherever you happen to lead me,

Just in case you might happen to need me,

All that you have to do is turn around,

For I'll be following you.



I am ready to go

Wherever you happen to lead me,

Just in case you might happen to need me,

All that you have to do is turn around,

For I'll be following you.
