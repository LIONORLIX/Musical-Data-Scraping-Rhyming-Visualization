When I Was On Top Of You


She'll never know what she meant to me.

Whenever I was with her I was always as gentle as I could be.

And now I don't know why, but she's gone away.

And I'll just have to stand on my own two legs.



Your eyes, your smile

Made my little life worthwhile.

There's was nothing I couldn't do

When I was on top of you.



I'd pull her hair, and she'd know to stop.

And when she'd look behind her, I'd always be there.

And now I don't know why, but she,

she's gone.

And all I can do is try to carry on.



Your eyes, your smile

Made my little life worthwhile.

The sky was a lot more blue,

When I was on top of you.

When I was on top of you.
