This Side Of Me


What is this magic I feel?

Seems no matter where I am, it finds me.

Puts the memories of hope inside me.

Makes me warm once more.



He's just a quiet man,

But his eyes can see right through me.

Is it only that I feel pity?

Could it be something more?



Safe as an island,

Far off to sea.

I'd almost forgotten

This side of me.



What is this magic I feel?

Thought this mushy stuff was below me.

Could it be he is the one to show me

What compassion is for?



Safe as an island,

Far off to sea.

I'd almost forgotten

This side of me.

Perhaps I'm not the cold bitch

I pretended to be.

I'd almost forgotten this side of me.
