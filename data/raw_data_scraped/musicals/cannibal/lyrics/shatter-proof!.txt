Shatter Proof!


Push me if you think I give a damn.

You got the wrong idea, man!

Think I can't hold my own. I don't need her. I don't need anybody.



So this is how it is, huh?

This is what I get for tryin.

Wrong man in the wrong place at the wrong time - that's me!



So this is how it goes, huh?

My reward for getting through.

I've had it bad, but I'm still doing fine.



I'm shatterproof!

There ain't nothin you can show me.

I'm still standing tall, so you all can blow me.

Know what I'm saying,

What I'm saying is true.

After what I've been through...

I'm shatterproof!



And that's the way it goes.

That's the way my life has been.

Tried being nice, but it didn't get me far.



Did everything I could for

The only thing I cared about.

She left me, that's cool. I don't need her.



You don't know what pain is.

Pain is being thrown away.

Have you given it everything you've got?



So this is how it goes, huh?

This is what it's all about.

Well, line up everybody and take your very best shot!



I'm shatterproof!

There ain't nothin you can show me.

I'm still standing tall, so why don't you blow me?

Know what I'm saying,

What I'm saying is true.

After what I've been through...



So this is how it goes, huh?

This is what I get for tryin.

Wrong guy in the wrong life in the wrong world.



Well, that's the way it goes, well...

That's what I'm getting used to.

Everything's over now that I've lost my girl.



I'm shatterproof!

There's nothin you can show me.

I'm still standing tall, so she can blow me!

Know what I'm saying,

What I'm saying is true.

After what I've been through...



I'm shatterproof!

There ain't nothin you can show me.

I'm still standing tall, so why don't you blow me?

Know what I'm saying,

What I'm saying is true.

After what I've been through...woo!

I'm shatterproof!
