Trapper Song


I can catch a helpless animal,

Skin it with my bare hands.

I wake up muddy,

And I go to bed bloody,

'Cause I'm a trappin' man.



I can brave the nastiest weather.

Weather!

Even if it's 80 below.

Below!

My pa was an elephant, but that's irrelevant.

My ma was an Eskimo.



I eat rabbits' heads for breakfast.

Breakfast!

With beaver butt on the side.

The side!

My mind's magnificent and my body no different.

I'm full of trapper pride!



Yo-ho! Yo-ho! Yo-ho!

Rip their fur, cut their skin with my knife.

Yo-ho! Yo-ho! Yo-ho!

One thing's for sure, there's nothing like a trappin' life!



I'm badder than the baddest sailor!

Sailor!

I make love to women to 10 feet tall.

Good lord!

I've got a chest of wonder and balls of thunder.

I can break right through a wall.



I love the sound of metal,

Metal!

Snapping on an animal's head.

Ka-chink!

Sometimes they scamper

Sometimes they whimper

But they always end up dead.



(Interlude by Nutter)

I've always wanted to be somebody

Who didn't get pushed around.

Now that I'm a trapper,

I'm the meanest guy around.

(Frenchy interrupts)

Second meanest!



The blood of a fresh-cut rodent

Is as sweet as brandy wine.

And the brain of an antelope

Tastes like cantaloupe.

What a yummy life!



Yo-ho! Yo-ho! Yo-ho!

Rip their fur, cut their eyes out with my knife.

Yo-ho! Yo-ho! Yo-ho!



(Song is cut short, due to the trapper trio's inability to sing in corresponding scales)

[Noon] Oh, Stop!

[Humphrey] That's sick.

[Frenchy] I agree. Nutter, you were singing in the wrong key!

[Nutter] No I wasn't. It was Loutzenheiser. I was singing in Eb minor.

[Frenchy] The song's in F# major!

[Bell] I think they're the same thing. I mean, Eb is the relative minor of F#.

[Frenchy] No, it isn't. The relative minor is 3 half-tones down from the major, not up!

[Noon] No, it's 3 down. Like A is the relative minor of C major.

[Loutzenheiser] But isn't A# in C major?

[Bell] Wait, are you singing Mixolydian scales, or something?

[Frenchy] A# is tonic to C major. It's the 6!

[Humphrey] No it isn't!

[Swan] Well, it'd be like a raised 13th if anything.

[Frenchy] Oh well. You guys are just a bunch of loser diggers anyhow!

[Humphrey] Oh see. You know we're right!
