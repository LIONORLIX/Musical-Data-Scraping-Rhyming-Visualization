The sky is blue and all the leaves are green.

The sun's as warm as a baked potato.

I think I know precisely what I mean,

We'll move along, set our goals high

With eyes full of hope as we aim for the...



Sky is blue and all the leaves are green.

My heart's as full as a baked potato.

I think I know precisely what I mean,

When I say it's a shpadoinkle day!

When I say it's a happy-go-moinkaly lucky shpadoinklely...dayyyyyy.
