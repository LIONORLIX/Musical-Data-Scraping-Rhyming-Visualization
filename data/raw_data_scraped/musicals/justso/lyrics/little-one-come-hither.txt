Little One Come Hither


Chorus

Great grey green

Limpopo river



Ec

Oh please excuse me for disturbing you sir

But i have only just arrived from whence i came

And as i'm new in thie promiscuous parts

I wonder if by chance you know this river's name



Crocodile

Little one come hither

I admire your style

This is the limpopo

And im the crocodile



Ec

Then surely you're the very creature

To ask while you have whiled away each sunny afternoon

You must have noticed where the crab likes to feed could you

Direct me to his favourite lagoon



Croc

Little one come hither

We should strike a deal

I'll give you directions

You give me a meal



Little one come hither

There is nothing to fear

Come a little closer

And i will whisper in your ear

A little closer

A little closer

I think today i shall begin with-the elephants child!





Elephants voices

Silly questions

Silly questions

Silly questions





Kolokolo

Why am i scared? How can i fall?

Birds take the air in their stride after all

Birds take the air in their stride....
