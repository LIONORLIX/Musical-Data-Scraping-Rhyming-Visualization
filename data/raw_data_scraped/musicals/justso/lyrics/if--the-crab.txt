If -The Crab


Em

If you can keep your head when all about you

Are loosing theirs and blaming it on you

If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you

But make allowance for their doubting too

If you can wait and not be tired by waiting or being lied about don't deal in lies

Or being hated don't give way to hating

And yet don't look too good

Nor talk to wise



If you can dream and not make dreams your master

If you can think and not make thoughts your aim

If you can meet with triumph and disaster

But treat those two imposters just the same

If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken

Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools

Or watch the things you gave your life to broken

And stoop and build them up with worn out tools

If you can make one heap of all your winnings

And risk it all on one turn of pitch and toss



Em and kolokolo and ec

And loose and start again at your beginnings

And never breathe a word about your loss



Company

Pau amma pau amma pau amma pau amma

Pau amma pau amma pau amma pau amma



(lib)

Ec

If you can force your heart and nerve

And sinew to serve your turn long after they are gone



Ec and kolokolo

And so hold on when there is nothing in you



Em

Except the will which says to them hold on



All 3 and company

Hold on....



Company

If you can fill the unforgiving minute

With sixty seconds worth of distance run

Yours is the earth and everything that's in it



Em

And which is more?...

You'll be a man...

My son



Company

Mmmm...
