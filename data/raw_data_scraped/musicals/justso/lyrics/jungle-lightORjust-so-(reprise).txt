Jungle Light/Just So (Reprise)


Eldest magician

Jungle light



Jungle light



Jungle light



Jungle light

Noone can escape it's touch, reaching down between the leaves,

Who can trust those magic fingers, light distorts and light decieves.



Beams of colour in the dark, streaming to the jungle floor,

Who is hiding in the shadows, who can be entirely sure



Company girls

(underneath)

Sifting the images shifting, who can be entirely sure



Eldest magician

Jungle light



Company

Pathcy blatchy strips and stripes



Eldest magician

Jungle light



Company

Spots and dots and speckled freckles



Eldest magician

Jungle light



Company

Spottle mottle splash and dash



Eldest magician

Jungle light



It's an illusion playing with the light



Company (underneath)

Jungle light illusions playing with the light



All

Reaching down between the leaves, light distorts

And light decieves, where the rays of sun light land,

There your bodies will be tanned

Jungle light

Jungle light

Jungle light

Jungle light







(just so reprise)

Giraffe

It's brash

Zebra

It's bold

Both

It's daring. But it's what we'll be wearing from this day on



(lib)





Wildebeest

It's brash, it's bold, it's daring

Giraffe and zebra

But it's what we'll be wearing...

All

From this day on

Just so we all know who's who

Just so we have a different job to do

Just so we can diversify

Filling the land and sea and sky

Making us easy to identify

Just so we know who we are meant to be

Just so i can tell him from me

If there's a niche that we can fill

In a fantastic way we will

Until at last we know

We've done all of our growing head to toe

We've done all of our growing head to toe

Becoming just...
