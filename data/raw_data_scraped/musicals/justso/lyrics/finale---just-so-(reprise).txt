Finale - Just So (Reprise)


Em

What i wanted was a range of creatures



Company

Just so



Em

Having features they could call their own



Company

Just so we all know who's

Just so we all know who's

Just so we all know who's who

Just so we have a different job to do

Just so we can diversify

Filling the land and sea and sky

Making us easy to identify

Just so we know who we are meant to be

Just so i can tell him from me



Just so zoologists have fun

Trying to list us one by one or two by two will do

The only thing they really need to know

We've done all of  our growing head to toe

We've done all of our growing head to toe

We've done all of our growing head to toe

We've done all of our growing head to toe



Em

Becoming just...so
