There's No Harm In Asking


There's no harm in asking

Why everything should be just so

There's no harm in dreaming

That someday I'll know all there is to know

I just want to know

Perhaps it's true that some surprises

Are much better left untold

But there's no harm in hoping

That one day their secrets

Unfold



Why does the ostrich have feathers that grow in a plume?

And why does the hippo have tiny red eyes

When there's so much room for eyes to bloom?

Why do camels get the hump?

Why does the crab play with the sea?



Why does no one seem to be bothered by questions but me?



In these High and Far-Off Times

There must be reasons behind rhymes

There must be answers to every question

And puzzle, I propose

Though I've asked all of my cousins

Aunts and uncles in their dozens

The only thing I've learned

Is no one knows

No one knows...



There's no harm in asking

Why everything should be just so

(I like his young, inquiring mind)

There's no harm in dreaming

That someday I'll know all there is know

(A joie-de-vivre...?)



Perhaps it's true that some surprises

Are far better left untold

But there's no harm in hoping

That one day their secrets

(One day their secrets)

Unfold



There's no harm in asking

(No harm in asking)

Why everything should be

Just so
