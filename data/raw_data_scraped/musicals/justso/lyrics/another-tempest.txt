Another Tempest


ADULT ELEPHANTS

Ha! Hey!

Ha! Hey!

Another Tempest

The water rises

Our skills at swimming would not win prizes

Our homes are flooded, The land?s a mire

So we aspire to move to higher ground

The sea is foaming

The waves are tidal

For us to stay here

Is suicidal

The crops are rotting

Our food is Scanty

It?s no sea shanty

So we are anti-crabs



Pau Amma, Pau Amma

He rules the Ocean Floor

And has us all firmly underneath his claw



Ha-a

Hey-ey

Ha-a

Hey-ey

Ha-a-ey

Hey-

(Fading) Mm

Mm

Mm...
