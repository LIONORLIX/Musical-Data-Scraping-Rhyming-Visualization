Leaps and Bounds


Kangaroo

Well i danced my dance to avoid this hound cos i got the strong impression

That i shouldn't be around

Though i loved the attention to be followed

And adored a dingo dog is something against

Which i'm not insured

It's a shame i'm not insured

So i went running running

I knew with speed and with my cunning i'd escape the dingo

Didn't look to me in such good shape

I had to run i had to run

I had to run

I had to run



Wallabies

He ran through the deserts and he ran through the mountains

He ran through the salt pans and danced in the fountains

He was hot he was thirsty but he knew darn well that first

He had to lose that hungry hound

And all the time his legs were coming on in leaps and bounds



Em

The kangaroo was so proud of his figure

But he didn't seem to notice when his legs got bigger



Wallabies

It's a wierd new look but he'll have to work it work it work it



Dingo

The dingo dog is ready to run another circuit

He may have the cunning but i knew he'd find wherever

He went running i was never far behind

At wallgong river he was at a loss

It's a width of whirling water with no way to get across

No way to get across



Kangaroo

But i went boing boing



Dingo

I found these antics most annoying what's the use i had

To swim to keep a breast with bouncing bruce

I made him hope i made him hop, i made him hope, i made him hop



Kanga

She made me hop, she made me hop, she made me hop, she made me hop



Wallabies

He hopped through the blue gums and he hopped through the flinders

He hopped through the tropics and leapt through the cinders

He hopped like a cricket we're surprised that he could stick it

Just to lose that hungry hound

And all the time his legs were coming on in leaps and bounds



Em

So keen was he to do well in the tussle

That he didn't stop to see what had happened to his muscle



Wallabies

That kangaroo leads a merry dance



Dingo

But he doesn't seem to know what's going on in his pants

(spoken)

Oh tie that kangaroo down sport



Kanga

Well i hopped one yard then i hopped another three

I was floating like a butterfly stinging like a bee

My legs were feeling strogner

So i hopped another five with all the joys of spring

I was so glad to be alive

So i went bounding bounding



Kanga and dingo

Bounding bounding



Wallabies

He hopped and he jumped and he leapt

And he bounded he hopped cross the islands that the ocean surrounded

And although he was flagging he still found the time for bragging

How he'd lost that hungry hound

And all the time his legs were coming on in leaps and bounds



All

All the time his legs were coming on in leaps and bounds
