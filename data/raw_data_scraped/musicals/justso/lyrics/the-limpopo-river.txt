The Limpopo River


You must go to the banks

Of the great grey-green

To the banks of the green

And greasy Limpopo River

Set about with fever trees

All aquiver

So you must go to the banks

Of the Limpopo River



On the banks of the river

Your search will end

There, where the Limpopo waters

Meet the might of the ocean

Dangers lurk

Beware your foolhardy notion

Journeys that end there may tend to

Bring much mixed emotion



It's great

As the River Nile

It's grey

But a certain style

It's green

Why not stay a while?

It's greasy!



It sounds rather vile

But if that's where I must go

Then plans should be made

Maybe I could bring an end to the crab's tirade

I'm not afraid



So you must go to the banks

Of the great grey-green

To the banks of the green

And greasy Limpopo River

Set about with fever trees

All aquiver



(So I must go) So you must go to the banks of the Limpopo River



You'll find your answer in the River Limpopo



You must go to the banks

Of the great

Grey grey-green

To the banks of

The great great greasy

Limpopo River

Set about with fever trees all aquiver



You must go to the banks

Of the great

Grey grey-green

To the banks of

The great great greasy

Limpopo
