Please Don't Touch My Stove


Parsee

Please don't touch my stove

It's all i have

My only treasure trove

So precious i will gladly face your charge no matter

What my crime as long as you don't try to come between my and my primus





Rhino

But what about my skin? It's all i have to keep myself within

But look at it all wrinkled up and more contorted than a worm is

However could you do this to a rhino's epidermis



Stove

Why do we torment eachother so?

Respect is all we need to show

To make a friend out of the foe

There we live united by the loam

The fringe of beaches that we comb

It's quaint but what the heck it's home





Parsee

I extend a hand

A token to bring peace back to our land

I never thought that i would see the day

When we would call a truce so i don't go on living like

That lonely mr crusoe





Rhino

I extend a trotter

To compensate for being such a rotter

From now on maybe you will bake me cakes

Ill relish every bite and who knows

If i eat enough my skin once more may tighten



All

Now at last hostilities can stop

It's time for barriers to drop



Rhino and parsee

We both have recipies to swap



All

How we'll/you'll go together with aplomb

Someone to walk with on the prom

And borrow cups of sugar from



Rhino and parsee

We now get the chance



Ec and stove

You ought to grab it



Rhino and parsee

To harmonise, we're buddies at first glance



Ec and stove

Why not cohabit?



Parsee

I'm resolute that from this moment on, i'll chnage the way i govern



Rhino

It was all my fault for being such a sloven



All

Friendship has arisen from a fruit bun

In the oven



Rhino, parsee and stove

Isn't this the perfect way to leave us as our story ends

Friends!
