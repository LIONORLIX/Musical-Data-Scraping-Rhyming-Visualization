Just So


STORYTELLER

(Spoken) Before the High and Far-Off Times,

O My Best Beloved, long before the Rhino has baggy skin,

or the Leopard had spots, or the Kangaroo had bounce, or the Elephant had a trunk,

came the Time of the Very Beginnings

and that was in the days when the Eldest Magician was getting things ready...

First he got the

Earth ready

then he got the Sea ready

and then he told all the animals that they could come out and play...

ANIMALS

Aah-ah

ELDEST MAGICIAN

(Spoken) The Eldest Magician was very pleased with his Creations...

...until he realised that they all looked alike. And the animals said...

ANIMALS

(Spoken) O Eldest Magician, what shall we play at for we all look the same?

ELDEST MAGICIAN

(Spoken) And he said...I will tell you

(Singing) There?s skin or fur or feathers

I leave the choice to you

Feet, Claws or Paws Or Trotters

All fours or up on two

This shade of brown i find there?s nothing duller

Every colour should be worth a try

A theme needs variation

Let your imagination fly



Just so you all know who?s who

Just so you have a different job to do

Just so you can diversify

Filling the land and sea and sky

Making you easy to identify



ANIMALS

Just so we know who we are meant to be

Just so i can tell him from me



ELDEST MAGICIAN

If there?s a niche that you can fill

In a fantastic way you will

Until at last you know

You?ve done all of your growing head to toe

ANIMALS

Becoming Just So

Becoming Just so

As birds and beasts and fishes

This comes as quite a shock

Unless we find an image

We?ll be the laughing stock

The situation is too much to stand

If choice is limited to just one brand

A theme needs variation and some imagination too

Just so we all know who?s who

Just so we have a different job to do

Just so we can diversify

Filling the land and sea and sky

Making us easy to identify

Just so we know who we are meant to be

Just so i can tell him from me

If there?s a niche that we can fill

In a fantastic way we will

Until at last we know

We?ve done all of our growing head to toe



If by design we have a weakness

Clearly it?s concerning our uniqueness



ELDEST MAGICIAN

Just so

You all know who?s who

So i can tell him from you

If there?s a niche that you can fill

In a fantastic way you will

Until at last you know

You?ve done all of your growing head to toe

You?ve done all of your growing head to toe

Becoming Just So



ANIMALS (UNDERNEATH)

Just so we know who we are meant to be

Just so i can tell him from me

If there?s a niche that we can fill

In a fantastic way we will

Until at last we know

We?ve done all of our growing head to toe

We?ve done all of our growing head to toe

Becoming Just So
