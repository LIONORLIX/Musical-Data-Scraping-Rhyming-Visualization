Super Heroes


I've done a lot, God knows I've tried

To find the truth, I've even lied

But all I know is down inside I'm bleeding.



And Super Heroes come to feast

To taste the flesh not yet deceased

And all I know is still the beast is feeding.



And crawling on the planet's face

Some insects called the human race

Lost in time, lost in space

And meaning.
