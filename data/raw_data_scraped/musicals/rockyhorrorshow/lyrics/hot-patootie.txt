Hot Patootie


Whatever happened to Saturday night

When you dressed up sharp and you felt alright?

It don't seem the same since cosmic light

Came into my life, I thought I was divine...



I used to go for a ride with a chick who'd go

And listen to the music on the radio

A saxophone was blowin' on a rock & roll show.

You climbed in the back seat, you really had a good time.



Hot patootie, bless my soul, I really love that rock 'n' roll.



My head used to swim from the perfume I smelled

My hands kind of fumbled with her white plastic belt

I'd taste her baby pink lipstick and that's when I'd melt

She'd whisper in my ear tonight she really was mine



Get back in front, put some hair oil on

Buddy Holly was singing his very last song.

With your arms around your girl you'd try to sing along.

It felt pretty good, oh, you really had a good time.



Hot patootie, bless my soul, I really love that rock 'n' roll.
