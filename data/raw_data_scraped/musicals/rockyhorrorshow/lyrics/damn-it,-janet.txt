Damn It, Janet


Hey Janet (Yes Brad?), I've got something to say.

I really loved the skilful way

You beat the other girls to the bride's bouquet!



The river was deep but I swam it, Janet

The future is ours so let's plan it, Janet

So please don't tell me to can it, Janet

I've one thing to say and that's



Dammit, Janet, I love you...



The road was long but i ran it, Janet

There's a fire in my heart and you fan it, Janet

If there's one fool for you then I am it, Janet

Now I've one thing to say and that's



Dammit, Janet, I love you...



Here's a ring to prove that I'm no joker

There's three ways that love can grow

That's good, bad or mediocre

Oh J-A-N-E-T I love you so



Oh it's nicer than Betty Munroe had, oh Brad

Now we're engaged and I'm so glad, oh Brad

That you've met Mum and you know Dad, oh Brad

I've one thing to say and that's



Brad I'm mad for you too...



Oh Brad, Oh... dammit!

I'm mad, Oh Janet!

For you, I love you too

There's one thing left to do, and that's



Go see the man who began it

When we met in his science exam-it

Made me give you the eye and then panic

There's one thing to say and that's



Dammit, Janet, I love you...



Dammit Janet; Oh brad, I'm mad

Dammit Janet; I love you!
