I Can Make You A Man (reprise)


But a deltoid and a bicep, a hot groin and a tricep

Makes me shake, makes me wanna take Charles Atlas by the...hand.



In just seven days I can make you a man.



I don't want no dissension, just dynamic tension.



(Janet) I'm a muscle fan.



In just seven days, I can make you a man

Dig it if you can:

In just seven days, I can make you a man.
