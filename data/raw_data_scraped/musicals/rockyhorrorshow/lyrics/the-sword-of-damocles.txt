The Sword Of Damocles


The sword of Damocles is hanging over my head

And I've got the feeling someone's gonna be cutting the thread

Oh, woe is me, my life is a misery

Oh, can't you see that I'm at the start of a pretty big downer?



I woke up this morning with a start when I fell out of bed

And left from my dreaming was a feeling of unnameable dread

My high is low, I'm dressed up with no place to go

And all I know, is I'm at the start of a pretty big downer...



Sha-la-la-la that ain't no crime

That ain't no crime



Rocky Horror you need peace of mind

And I want to tell you that you're doing just fine

You're the product of another time

And feeling down, well that's no crime...



The sword of Damocles is hanging over my head

And I've got the feeling someone's gonna be cutting the thread

Oh, woe is me, my life is a mystery

Oh, can't you see that I'm at the start of a pretty big downer?



Sha-la-la-la that ain't no crime

That ain't no crime
