Once In A While


Once in a while she don't want to call you

Speaking on the telephone

And once in your life she won't want to know you

You look around, the one you found she is gone



And that's all the time that it takes

For a heart to turn to stone

The sweeter the wine the harder to make the break

You hear something about someone you thought you'd known



So baby don't cry like there's no tomorrow

After the night there's brand new day

And there'll be no pain and no more sorrow

So wash your face and phone my place, it'll be okay.



And that's all the time that it takes

For a heart to beat again

So give me a sign that a lover makes

You look around, the one you found is back again...
