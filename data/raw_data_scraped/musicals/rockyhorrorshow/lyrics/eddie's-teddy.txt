Eddie's Teddy


From the day he was born, he was trouble.

He was the thorn in his mother's side.

She tried in vain, but he never caused her nothing but shame.

He left home the day she died...



From the day she was gone, all he wanted

Was rock'n'roll, porn and a motorbike

Shooting up junk

He was a low-down, cheap little punk.

Taking everyone for a ride...



When Eddie said he didn't like his teddy you knew he was a no-good kid

But when he threatened your life with a switchblade knife

What a guy

Makes you cry

Und I did.



Everybody shoved him, I very nearly loved him

I said hey listen to me, stay sane inside insanity

But he locked the door and threw away the key...



But he must been drawn into something

Making him warn me in a note which reads (what's it say, what's it say?)

"I'm outta my head, O hurry or I may be dead.

They mustn't carry out their evil deeds..."



When Eddie said he didn't like his teddy you knew he was a no-good kid
