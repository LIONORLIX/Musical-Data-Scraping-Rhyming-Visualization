Over At The Frankenstein Place


In the velvet darkness of the blackest night

Burning bright, there's a guiding star

No matter what or who you are.



There's a light over at the Frankenstein Place

There's a light burning in the fireplace

There's a light, light in the darkness of everybody's life.



I can see the flag fly, I can see the rain

Just the same, there has got to be

Something better here for you and me.



There's a light over at the Frankenstein Place

There's a light burning in the fireplace

There's a light, light in the darkness of everybody's life.



The darkness must go down the river of nights dreaming

Flow morphia slow, let the sun and light come streaming

Into my life, into my life.



There's a light over at the Frankenstein Place

There's a light burning in the fireplace

There's a light, light in the darkness of everybody's life.
