I Can Make You A Man


A weakling weighing ninety-eight pounds

Will get sand in his face when kicked to the ground.



And soon in the gym with a determined chin,

The sweat from his pores as he works for his cause...

Will make him glisten... and gleam

And with massage, and just a little bit of steam

He'll be pink and quite clean

He'll be a strong man. Oh honey...

But the wrong man.



He'll eat nutritious high protein and swallow raw eggs.

Try to build up his shoulders, his chest, arms, and legs.

Such an effort if he only knew of my plan.

In just seven days, I can make you a man.



He'll do press-ups, and chin-ups, do the snatch, clean and jerk.

He thinks dynamic tension must be hard work.

Such strenuous living I just don't understand

When in just seven days, oh baby, I can make you a man.
