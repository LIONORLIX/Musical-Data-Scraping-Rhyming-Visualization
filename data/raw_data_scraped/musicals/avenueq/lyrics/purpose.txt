Purpose


Princeton

Purpose,

It's that little flame

That lights a fire

Under your ass.

Purpose,

It keeps you going strong

Like a car with a full

Tank of gas.

Everyone else has

A purpose

So what's mine?

Oh, look! Here's a penny!

It's from the year i was born!

It's a sign!

Ba-ba-ba-ba

Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo

I don't know how i know,

But i'm gonna find

My purpose.

I don't know where

I'm gonna look,

But i'm gonna find

My purpose.

Gotta find out,

Don't wanna wait!

Got to make sure that my

Life will be great!

Gotta find my purpose

Before it's too late.

Princeton

I'm gonna find my purpose



Moving boxes and others

He's gonna find his purpose



Moving boxes and others(overlapping)

Maybe more...

At a job, or smoking grass

Pottery class

Would be cool...

Yes it could!

Something good!

You're gonna find

Your purpose...

Gotta find your purpose...

Purpose is a mystery.

Gotta find it!

You're gonna find

Your purpose

Whoa, whoa, whoa...

You're gonna find.

Your purpose

Whoa, whoa, whoa...



Princeton (overlapping)

I'm gonna find my purpose

Could be far, could be near

Could take a week,

A month, a year

At a job, or smoking grass

Maybe at a pottery class!

Could it be?

Yes it could!

Something's coming,

Something good!

I'm gonna find my purpose

I'm gonna find my purpose

I'm gonna find it.

What will it be? Where will ft be?

My purpose in life is a mystery

Gotta find my purpose

Gotta find me.

I'm gonna find my purpose!

Purpose purpose purpose!

Yeah yeah!

Gotta find me.
