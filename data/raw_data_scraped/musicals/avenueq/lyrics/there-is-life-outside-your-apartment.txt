There Is Life Outside Your Apartment


Brian:

Princeton:

Yeah.



Brian:

Listen, buddy, nobody?s seen ya for two weeks.

What?s up with that?



Princeton:

I went to work for a temp agency, and they

fired me for being too depressing on the phone.

I maxed out my cards, I?m two months behind

in rent, I totally messed up my personal life.

Oh, and Brian - I still haven?t found my purpose!



Brian:

All right. Get off your ass and stop worrying!

Everyone?s getting together to mess around the city today.



Princeton:

Have fun!



Brian:

When I say everyone, that includes you!



There is life outside your apartment.

I know it?s hard to conceive.

But there?s life outside your apartment.

And you?re only gonna see it if you leave.



There is cool shit to do,

But it can?t come to you,

And who knows, dude

You might even score!



There is life outside your apartment.

But you gotta open the door!



Princeton:

No, thanks, I?m staying in!



Brian:

Don?t tell me I gotta force you.



Princeton:

Squashed on the street.
