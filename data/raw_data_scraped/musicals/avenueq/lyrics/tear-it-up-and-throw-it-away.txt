Tear It Up And Throw It Away


Kate:

Oh Nicky, Nicky, bad news.



Nicky:

What's the matter Kate?



Kate:

I can't go with you to the Phish concert at the Aquarium.



Nicky:

Oh no, I was looking forward to that!



Kate:

Me too.



Nicky:

Oh, why can't you come?



Kate:

I got jury duty.



Nicky:

Jury duty?



Kate:

Mm Hm.



Nicky:

Aw, Kate, you don't have to go to Jury duty.



Kate:

Yes I do. I got this summons in the mail, it says I have to go.



Nicky:

Oh, what summons?



Kate:

This one.



Nicky:

No. WHAT summons?



Kate:

THIS one.



Nicky:

No Kate you don't understand: Tear it up and throw it away.



Kate:

What?



Nicky:

Throw it away, Throw it away! Tear it up and throw it away.

And go about your day!



Kate:

Oh, I can't do that! This is an official summons.



Nicky:

Oh! An official summons. Well, why didn't you say so?

Tear it up and throw it away!



Kate:

Just. Tear it up?



Nicky:

Yeah! And throw it away!

Tear it up and throw it away, so you and I can play.



Kate:

But, isn't it my civic duty?



Nicky:

Aw! Who gives a doody? The government employees already know,

For many reasons many people just won't show.

A piece of mail's an easy thing to overlook, so just like the airlines, they overbook!



Kate: Oh!



Both:

Tear it up and throw it away! Throw it away! Throw it away!

Tear it up and throw it away,



Nicky:

It's perfectly okay.



Kate:

Ah! Oh but wait a minute, wait a minute.

It says here the penalty is 30 days in jail.



Nicky:

KATE! No one's ever gone to jail! Gone to jail! Gone to jail!

Have you ever heard of anyone who's gone to jail,



Kate:

Oh! 'Cause something got lost in the mail! OH!



Nicky: Exactly!



Both:

Tear it up and throw it away! Throw it away! Throw it away!

Tear it up and throw it away! (tear)



Nicky:

Yeah, you got it!



Kate: Did not!



Nicky:

Right!



Both:

And go about your day!



Nicky:

Only the little people do jury duty Kate!



Kate:

Yeah!
