Fantasies Come True


ROD

It sure can get lonely at night.  Nicky, you awake?

NICKY

Ah, is that a unicorn?

ROD

Ugh, he's talking in his sleep again.

NICKY

No, I'll wear the purple shoes.  Hh, who painted the kitten?

ROD

Ugh, maybe I should just shake him.

NICKY

I love you, Rod

ROD

What did you say?

NICKY

I love your little laugh

ROD

Nicky?  Are you awake?

NICKY

Take off your shirt

ROD

Oh Nicholas!  Have you been shy all this time?

Have we been... hiding from each other?  I wonder...



All those nights

I'd lay in bed

Thoughts of you

Running through my head



NICKY

I know, put my earmuffs on the cookie



ROD

But I never thought

The things in my head

Could really happen

In my bed



NICKY

You look like David Hasselhoff



ROD

All those years

I missed the signs

Couldn't read

Between the lines



Who'd have thought

I would see the day

Where I'd hear you say

What I heard you say



And now I find

What was always in my mind was in your mind too

Who knew?  Fantasies come true

And now I see

That what I always dreamed of was meant to be

You and me and you, fantasies come true



MUSICAL INTERLUDE



ROD

You and me lived in fantasy

But we'll be a reality



PRINCETON

Kate, that was amazing!

KATE

You're amazing

PRINCETON

Heh, I want you to have this.

It's a penny I carry around with me for good luck.

It's from the year I was born, see?

Who knows?  Maybe it'll bring you good luck.  It did for me.  I found you.



I want you to know

The time that we've spent

How great it's been

How much it's meant



KATE

Gosh, I don't know what to say

I'm really glad you feel that way



Cuz I'm afraid

That I like you more

Than I've ever liked

Any guy before



ROD                       KATE

Cuz now                  Cuz now

My love                  My love



BOTH

I'm getting what I've always been dreaming of



ROD                       KATE

So are you               Oh Baby



BOTH

Fantasies come true



KATE                      ROD

And now                  And now

I swear                  I swear that



BOTH

When you want me I'm gonna be right there



ROD                       KATE

To care                  To care



BOTH

For you



KATE

That's what I'm gonna do



ROD                        KATE

And make your fantasies   Fantasies



BOTH

Come true



ROD

Fantasies come true



NICKY

Uh, hey Rod, buddy, you're talking in your sleep.

ROD

Oh, I thought you were talking in your sleep...

NICKY

No I just came to bed.  Heh, you're dreamin' is all.

ROD

Oh.

NICKY

Sounded like a nice dream, though.

ROD

Yes it was a nice dream.

NICKY

Goodnight!

ROD

Goodnight, Nicky.
