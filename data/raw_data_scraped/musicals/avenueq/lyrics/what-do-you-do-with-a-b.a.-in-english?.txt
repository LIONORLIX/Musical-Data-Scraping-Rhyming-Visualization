What Do You Do with a B.A. in English?


What do you do with a B.A. in English,

What is my life going to be?

Four years of college and plenty of knowledge,

Have earned me this useless degree.



I can't pay the bills yet,

'Cause I have no skills yet,

The world is a big scary place.



But somehow I can't shake,

The feeling I might make,

A difference,

To the human race.



Morning, Brian.



Hi, Kate Monster.



How's life?



Disappointing.



What's the matter?



The catering company laid me off.
