I Wish I Could Go Back to College


KATE MONSTER:

I wish I could go back to college.

Life was so simple back then.



NICKY:

What would I give to go back and live in a dorm with a meal plan again!



PRINCETON:

I wish I could go back to college.

In college you know who you are.

You sit in the quad, and think, "Oh my God!

I am totally gonna go far!"



ALL:

How do I go back to college?

I don't know who I am anymore!



PRINCETON:

I wanna go back to my room and find a message in dry-erase pen on the door!

Ohhh...

I wish I could just drop a class...



NICKY:

Or get into a play...



KATE MONSTER:

Or change my major...



PRINCETON:

Or fuck my T.A.



ALL:

I need an academic advisor to point the way!

We could be...

Sitting in the computer lab,

4 A.M. before the final paper is due,

Cursing the world 'cause I didn't start sooner,

And seeing the rest of the class there, too!



PRINCETON:

I wish I could go back to college!



ALL:

How do I go back to college?!

AHHHH...



PRINCETON:

I wish I had taken more pictures.



NICKY:

But if I were to go back to college,

Think what a loser I'd be-

I'd walk through the quad,

And think "Oh my God..."



ALL:

"These kids are so much younger than me."
