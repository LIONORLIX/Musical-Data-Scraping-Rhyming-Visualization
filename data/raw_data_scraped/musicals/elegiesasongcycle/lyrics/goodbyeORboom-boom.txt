Goodbye/Boom Boom


Man:

I would like to say it`s been a privilege

Living my life with you

Who would`ve bet` When we met things would turn out as well as they did

We had a sweet remarkable kid

The first of an expected four

I`m thinkin` we won`t have many more

Hey

Just saying my goodbyes

The living was the prize

The ending`s not the story

Just saying my goodbyes

Goodbye



Woman:

Boom boom

The architect is screaming

Boom boom

He sees his buildings burn

Boom boom

He writes to whom it does concern

And stands there like a lion grieving

Nodding, disbelieving

When will decency return`

Boom boom

Her husband left home early

Boom boom

She turns the tv on

And scrolling down is a list of tiny names

The place he works is in flames

She wanted so many things

The phone rings



Man:

Tell our perfect child I wasn`t perfect

Except in loving him

I expect, I`m correct

When I say he`s the salt of the earth

Remember, my love

The day of his birth

When I sang goofy songs and wept

I thought we had it all except

Now

I`m saying my goodbyes

The living was the prize

The endings not the story

I`m saying my goodbyes

Goodbyes

Goodbyes

Goodbye



Woman:

Boom boom

The machine picked up the phone call

Boom boom

Her feet were made of lead

Boom boom

She listened as her husband said

The words she always hoped he`d murmur

Still her feet held firmer

When he hung up, she went to bed

Boom

Her son at school

Boom boom boom

Life shattered

Boom the golden rule

Everything went boom boom boom boom

Boom boom

The architect, the dreamer

Assumes everything will collapse

The buildings fall

And he sits there whistling Taps

Outside the air`s opaque white

Outside the day`s turned to night

Its hell

Oh well



Both:(overlapping)

Why not restart the day

Let`s say it never happened

Why won`t the picture fit the frame

Throw those bad hours away

Make like it never happened

Will our lives ever be the same

Boom Boom Boom

Boom Boom Boom
