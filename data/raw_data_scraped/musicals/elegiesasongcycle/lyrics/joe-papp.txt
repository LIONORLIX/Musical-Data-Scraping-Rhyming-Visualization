Joe Papp


[MAN THREE]

Joe decreed that

Theatre was essential

To the welfare of our city

He made theatre feel not incidental

Something very elemental to our city

He was like a giant

Biblical, defiant



Joe wished he could give the world a slap

Joe Papp never took crap

Except, perhaps from writers

Joe Papp encourages writers

To fight for their frightening plays



Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe

What's your plan?

Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe

Dibba dibba dibba dibba dibba dibba dibba

Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe

You da man

Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe

Dibba dibba dibba dibba dibba dibba dib



I never understood

What Joe was saying to me

He'd quote Shakespeare

And I'd simply nod

Is this how the prophets

Felt in the presence

Is this how the prophets felt in the presence of God?



[ALL MEN]

Joe Papp never took crap

Even from Robert Moses

Joe saw a theater in Central Park

And Moses built what Joe proposed

Yes, Moses built an outdoor theater

Moses thinks it's pork

But it lights up New York

It lights up New York!



Joe Papp never took crap

Except, perhaps from writers

Joe Papp encourages writers

To fight for their frightening plays

Joe Papp never took crap

Except, perhaps from writers

Joe Papp encourages writers

To fight for their frightening plays



Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe

You da man

Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe

Dibba dibba dibba dibba dibba dibba dibba

Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe

You the man

Dibba dibba dibba dibba dibba dibba

Joe Papp

Never took

Crap
