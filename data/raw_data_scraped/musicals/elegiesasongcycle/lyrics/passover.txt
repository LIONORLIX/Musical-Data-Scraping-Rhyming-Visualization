Passover


Passover

At Aunty Honey`s and Uncle Harvey`s in New Jersey

My sister would hold her breath

Over the George Washington bridge

And we would laugh at her, she`d frown

Everyone, including Nana Ida would be standing by the front door

As pulled up and we`d count down

Four, three, two, one!

And we`d fight to be the first out of the car

Having come this far

Having come so far for this feast

This feast of new yeast

And the matzo balls are so hard when you cut them they just fly

Why`

Passover



On this day

We read of plagues and misfortunes then start eating

Uncle Harvey`s the cook

Ma laughed so loud that she shook

Cousin Gary is reading porn

We`ve run out of skullcaps some men are wearing

Acapulco Beach Club bandanas that really, really, really should not be worn

We are Jews from like the first 5,000 years

Laughing through our tears

Joyous, vulgar, anything goes

But we wear nice clothes

That`s the way I like remembering this scene: manic and high

Why`

Passover



In the Passover prayer book

We read about what Pharaoh did to the Jews

About how Pharaoh wore those big gold platform shoes

And the Jews escaped stealthily

But splitting the red sea

Wait, WAIT!

I think that was a movie



Anyway, when I tell the story of Passover

As I am instructed to do

I will include how the Jews of Natick traveled over the Hudson river

And had an unforgettable seder

More details about that later`.



It`s LATER!

Michael as the youngest sings out the four old questions

What they mean is unknown

My father`s playing trombone

Then we go to meet Elijah at the door

I can see the faces `round the table

And the grins are getting larger

And the voices begin to soar

One, two, three, four!

And I think that we will never laugh so hard, never feel so free

I think life that night was more perfect than it will ever be

Uncle Bernie and my mother overwhelmed begin to cry

Why`

Passover



Uncle Bernie passed over

Uncle Harvey passed over

Nana Ida passed over

And my mother, my mother passed over

Passover
