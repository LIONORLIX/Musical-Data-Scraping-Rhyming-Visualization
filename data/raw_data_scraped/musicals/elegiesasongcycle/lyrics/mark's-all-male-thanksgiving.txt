Mark's All-Male Thanksgiving


MAN TWO AND WOMAN

Looking in the window

Of this empty house space

I see their reflections in my face



MAN ONE

Every Thanksgiving Mark made his all-male Thanksgiving dinner

Where men cooked the turkey and men made the cranberry sauce- without nuts

Cause men don`t like nuts

But the stuffing was manly and the fingerbowls ditto

And ditto, the pureed sweet yams

Very manly when Mark made his all-male Thanksgiving



Bill Sherwood was present, he wrote and directed Parting Glances

A movie for which Mark raised the money and which Arthur invested-

And the Thanksgiving crew

Put money in too

Steve Buscemi was featured, his first time on screen

And you knew you were watching a star

God, he was great, but he wasn`t at Mark`s all-male Thanksgiving



Remembering this is sort of like Grandpa remembering his shtetl

It seems as they place so, so long ago

In the past

The memories last, but fade

What a community we made



Diplomats, poets, opera guys, guys dressed in leather britches

Some paunchy, some starting to bald, and some were awful

And some were okay

In a non-threatening way

Mark the lawyer wore flannel, he comes from Wisconsin

The handsomest guy wore a tie

That was Arthur sweetly decent, funny, and living

I met Arthur when Mark made his all-male Thanksgiving



And the excellent movie, that Bill Sherwood filmed

Was his first and his last

Since alas the boy passed

Arthur still when he smiles, he makes my heart flutter

We think it`s been twenty-two years

I wrote this song to not forget Mark`s all-male Thanksgiving

It`s been so long since Mark made his all-male Thanksgiving

Where we gave thanks
