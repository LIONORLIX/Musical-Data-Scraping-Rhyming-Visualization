Mister Choi & Madame G


Across my street

I am looking at a store

I don't go to anymore

But, I used to very often

Now it's sitting like a coffin

Slightly used

I'm remembering the whole thing

Unamused



This place was just a fruit stand

I think

Was run, I think

By Eastern Europeans

Who in a year were

Bought out by Koreans

And their family from Seoul

Who fed me at their family sink

We ate Kim Chi

And followed their traditions

I told them about my craziest ambitions

And they handed me a bowl

Filled with luck and self control



Looking in the window of this empty house space

I see their reflections in my face

I see Mister Choi and Madame G

Squawking at their family

Who stand there with these irritated grins

The children always practicing their violins

Open 24 hours from dawn till dawn

And one day they were gone



What happened to these wonderful friends

In twenty years

I never got a letter

I hope their lives got infinitely better

And I wanted to explain

How their friendship kept me sane



Looking in

Looking in

The window of this empty house space

Empty house space

I see there

I see there

Reflections in my face, face



I see Mister Choi and Madame G

Mister Choi and Madame G

Treating me like family

Treating me like family

They cooked

I fed their children and their cat

Ooh

I wasn't staff

But made them laugh and that was that

Open 24 hours from dawn till dawn

And one day they were gone

Open 24 hours

From dawn till dawn

And one day they were gone

And one day they were gone

And one day they were gone

And one day they were gone
