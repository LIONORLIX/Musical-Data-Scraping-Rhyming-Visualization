When the Earth Stopped Turning


I remember what you said

I remember every word

I remember how the earth stopped turning

We were sitting on the bed

And the clock was ticking louder

There's the overwhelming smell of powder in the air

Everything is skewed

Everything is blurred

I remember every word



I remember how we roared

Laughed so hard we almost cried

Laughed so long I felt the earth stop turning

We were never ever bored

And you made us feel amazing

We were blazing through our lives like comets through the sky

Now that you're not here

Everything's awry



The world is good you said

Enjoy its highs you said

The summer flies you said

So make a parade

Of every moment

Now throw away your hate

And focus on what's great instead

I'm dying so there's no time for debate

You said



I remember how you smiled

You were trying not to smile

Then you smiled and the earth stopped turning

All the images are filed

All the images keep flicking

Also all of us are slow at picking up our cues

Nothing left to win

Nothing more to lose



The earth is good she said

Enjoy its shit she said

'Cus this is it she said

So make a parade

Of every moment

Now pull up to the curb

The sign Do not disturb's ahead

The truth is that you made my life superb

She said



On a Sunday night in May

In a very quiet way

I remember how the earth stopped turning

Turning

Turning

Turning!
