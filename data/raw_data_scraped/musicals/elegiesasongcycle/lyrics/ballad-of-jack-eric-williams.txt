Ballad of Jack Eric Williams


WILLIAM FINN

(speak)

Shelter Island! Summer of 2000.



(sing)

Ricky Ian Gordon

You asked me to write you a lyric

You said either story, song, or hymn..s

But your three names remind me of our friend

Jack Eric Williams

Ja-a-ack



Hey, Ricky!

How did he die?-

Wait, let me begin

Yes, I know the diabetic

He forgot to take his insulin

But, he forgot



RICKY

Do you really think he forgot?



WILLIAM FINN

Or was he simply distraught?

For a million reasons why

And what he wanted he got

And he wanted to die-ie-ie



He could write circles around everybody

Around me anyway

But as Jack Eric Williams would constantly say

He wasn?t the fashion of the day-

Were you sick of hearing that?

I was sick of hearing that!

I took it very personally

I thought he was attacking me



Anyway I miss him

And I miss his inappropriateness too

How fat was he?

It seems he just grew and grew and grew and grew

And did you ever see him eat, Ricky?

Did you ever see him chew?

Did you ever see him bite?

Now that?s what I call an appetite



If he?d only lived a little longer

If he?d only lived a little longer, Ricky

With his great musical ear

And cranky elusive passion

Our boy Jack, I think

Would have finally been in fashion



Is the kind of lyric you wanted, Ricky?

No(w)- If you hate it, I?ll write you another lyric, Ricky

Ricky, are you still there?



And at his memorial service

Were you there?

Were you there?

Everyone was saying how Jack had never received the acclaim he deserved

Which of course I believed, but more quietly reserved

And at the end of the service, ugh

I was talking to Quentin Crisp

And he said,

?I never understood his music.?



(speak)

There were gasps in the crowd. People fainted on the floor.



(sing)

?I never understood why the melodies went where they went.

It?s all a crime, gone so wrong.

But, I never understood his song.?



And then I started laughing

Not a little tee-hee

But a laugh from the belly

Which confounded even me

I said, ?I must disagree.?

Ricky! I didn?t know what to say

So I said,

?Jack Eric Williams doesn?t seem to be

The fashion of the day.?



BOTH

If he had only lived a little longer

If he?d only lived a little longer, Ricky



RICKY

Ooooo?



WILLIAM FINN (during ooo?)

His great musical ear

And his cranky elusive passion

Our boy Jack, I think

Would?ve finally been



BOTH

In fashion



WILLIAM FINN

That?s all the news from Shelter Island

Though it?s not exactly news

Give my best to all the three-named composers

Including, especially you

We should all remember to take our insulin

Love, William ALAN Finn
