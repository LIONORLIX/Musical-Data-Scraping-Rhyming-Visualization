Now I Have Everything


(Perchik)

I used to tell myself,

That i had everything,

But that was only half true,

I had an aim in life,

And that was eveyrthing,

But now i even have you.



I have,

Something that i would die for,

Something that i would live for too-

Yes!



Now i have everything,

Not only everything,

I have a little bit more

Besides haviing everything,

I know what everything's for.



I used to wonder "could there be a wife?"

To share such a difficult,

Wand'ring kind of life.



(hodel)

I was only out of sight,

Waiting right here.



(perchik)

Who knows tomorrow where our home will be.



(hodel)

I'll be with you and that's home enough for me.



(perchik)

Everything is right at hand.



(both)

Simple and clear.



(perchik)

I have something that i would die for,

Someone that i would live for too!

Yes!

Now i have evyerthing!

Not only everything,

I have a little bit more

Besides having everything, i know what everything's for
