The Rumor


(Yente)

"Rifka, I have such news for you"



Remember Perchik, that crazy student?

Remember at the wedding

When Tzeitel married Motel

And Perchik started dancing

With Tevye's daughter Hodel?

Well, I just heard

That Perchik's been arrested, in Kiev



(Others)

No!



(Yente)

Yes!



(Woman 1)

"Shaindel, Shaindel Wait till I tell you."



Remember Perchik, that crazy student?

Remember at the wedding

He danced with Tevye's Hodel

Well, I just heard

That Hodel's been arrested, in Kiev



(Others)

No! terrible, terrible



(Woman 2)

"Mirala."



Do you remember Perchik

That student from Kiev?

Remember how he acted

When Tzeitel married Motel?

Well, I just heard

That Motel's been arrested

For dancing at the wedding



(Others)

No!



(Woman 2)

In Kiev!



(Mendel)

"Rabbi... Rabbi."



Remember Perchik, with all his strange ideas?

Remember Tzeitel's wedding?

Where Tevye danced with Golde

Well, I just heard

That Tevye's been arrested

And Golde's gone to Kiev



(Others)

No!



(Mendel)

God forbid



(Others)

She didn't



(Mendel)

She did



(Avram)

"Terrible news. Terrible."



Remember Perchik

Who started all the trouble

Well, I just heard from someone who should know

That Golde's been arrested

And Hodel's gone to Kiev

Motel studies dancing

And Tevye's acting strange

Shprintze has the measels

And Bielke has the mumps



(Yente)

And that's what comes from men and women dancing!
