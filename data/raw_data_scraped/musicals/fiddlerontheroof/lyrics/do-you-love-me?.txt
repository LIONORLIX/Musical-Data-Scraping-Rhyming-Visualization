Do You Love Me?


(Tevye)

"Golde, I have decided to give Perchik permission to become engaged to our daughter, Hodel."



(Golde)

"What??? He's poor! He has nothing, absolutely nothing!"



(Tevye)

"He's a good man, Golde.

I like him. And what's more important, Hodel likes him. Hodel loves him.

So what can we do?

It's a new world... A new world. Love. Golde..."



Do you love me?



(Golde)

Do I what?



(Tevye)

Do you love me?



(Golde)

Do I love you?

With our daughters getting married

And this trouble in the town

You're upset, you're worn out

Go inside, go lie down!

Maybe it's indigestion



(Tevye)

"Golde I'm asking you a question..."



Do you love me?



(Golde)

You're a fool



(Tevye)

"I know..."



But do you love me?



(Golde)

Do I love you?

For twenty-five years I've washed your clothes

Cooked your meals, cleaned your house

Given you children, milked the cow

After twenty-five years, why talk about love right now?



(Tevye)

Golde, The first time I met you

Was on our wedding day

I was scared



(Golde)

I was shy



(Tevye)

I was nervous



(Golde)

So was I



(Tevye)

But my father and my mother

Said we'd learn to love each other

And now I'm asking, Golde

Do you love me?



(Golde)

I'm your wife



(Tevye)

"I know..."

But do you love me?



(Golde)

Do I love him?

For twenty-five years I've lived with him

Fought him, starved with him

Twenty-five years my bed is his

If that's not love, what is?



(Tevye)

Then you love me?



(Golde)

I suppose I do



(Tevye)

And I suppose I love you too



(Both)

It change a thing

But even so

After twenty-five years

It's nice to know
