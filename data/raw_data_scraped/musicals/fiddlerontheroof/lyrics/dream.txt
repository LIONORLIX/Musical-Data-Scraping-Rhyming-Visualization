Tevye:

AAAh! help help!



Golde:

(Tevye screams)



What's the matter with you? Why are you howling like that?



Tevye:

Where is she? Where is she?



Golde:

Where is who? What are you talking about?



Tevye:

Fruma Sarah, the butcher's first wife. She was standing there a minute ago!



Golde:

What's the matter with you Tevye? Fruma Sarah's been dead for years! You must have been dreaming. Tell me what

you dreamed and I'll tell you what it meant.



Tevye:

All right, only... don't be frightened! In the beginning I dreamt that we were having a celebration of some kind.

Everybody we knew was there. Musicians too. Suddenly, in comes your grandma Tzietl, may she rest in peace.

Naturally, I went up to greet her, and she said:

Grandma Tzietl:

A blessing on your head

(Mazel Tov, Mazel Tov)

To see a daughter wed

(Mazel Tov, Mazel Tov)

By the name of Lazer-Wolfe



Grandma Tzietl:

For such a match I prayed

(Mazel Tov, Mazel Tov)

In heaven it was made

(Mazel Tov, Mazel Tov)

A fine upstanding boy

A comfort and a joy

If my grandma Tzietl, may she rest in peace,

Took the time to come all the way from the other world to tell us

About the tailor all I can say is that it's for the best.

And couldn't possibly get any better. Amen.
