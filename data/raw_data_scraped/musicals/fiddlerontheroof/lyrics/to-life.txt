To Life


To life! To life! L'chai-im!

L'chai-im, l'chai-im, to life!

If you've been lucky, then Monday was No worse than Sunday

was,

Drink l'chai-im, to life.



To life, l'chai-im!

L'chai-im, l'chai-im, to life!

One day it's honey and raisin cake,

Next day a stomach ache,

Drink L'chai-im, to life!



Our great men have written words of

Wisdom to be used

When hardship must be faced;

Life obliges us with hardship

So the words of wisdom

shouldn't go to waste.



To us and our good fortune

Be happy be healthy, long life!

And if our good fortune never comes

Here's to whatever comes,

Drink l'chaim, to life!



To life, to life, l'chai-im,!

L'chai-im, l'chai-im, to life!

Life has a way of confusing us

Blessing and bruising us,

Drink l'chaim, to life,



To life, l'chaim!

L'chaim, l'chaim, to life!

A gift we seldom are wise enough

Ever to prize enough,

Drink l'chaim, to life!



God would like us to be joyful

Even though our hearts lie panting on the floor;

How much more can we be joyful,

When there's really something

To be joyful for.



To life, to life, L'chai-im!

L'chai-im, l'chai-im, to life!

It gives you something to think about,

Something to drink about,

Drink l'chai-im, to life! l'chai-im !



the blessing and bruising us part comes first.



the honey and raisin cake is not in the song at all.



you forgot the part about there lives being more

pleasent



then there future ones.



This may be a version of "To Life", but it's not the

version from either the play or the movie. In "Fiddler,"

the song is about the wedding of Tevye's daughter.



To Life



Here's to our prosperity, our good health and happiness,

and most important ...

To life, to life, la kayim,

La kayim, la kayim, to life,

Here's to the father I tried to be,

Here's to my bride-to-be,

Drink la kayim, to life,

To life, la kayim,

La kayim, la kayim, to life,

Life has a way of confusing us,

Blessing and bruising us,

Drink la kayim, to life!

God would like us to be joyful, even when our hearts lie

panting on the floor.

How much more can we be joyful, when there's really

something to be joyful for?

To life, to life, la kayim,

To Tzeitel, my daughter--my wife,

It gives you something to think about,

Something to drink about,

Drink la kayim, to life!



(Le Morta!

Yes, Lazar Wolf?

Drinks for everyone!

What's the occasion?

I'm taking myself a bride!

Who is it?

Tevye's eldest, Tzeitel!)



To Lazar Wolf--

To Tevye!

To Tzeitel, your daughter--my wife!

May all your futures be pleasant ones,

Not like our present ones,

Drink la kayim, to life,

To life, la kayim,

La kayim, la kayim, to life,

It takes a wedding to make us say,

"Let's live another day,"

Drink la kayim, to life!

We'll raise a glass and sip a drop of schnapps in honor of

the great

good luck that favors you,

We know that when good fortune favors two such men, it

stands to reason,

we deserve it too!

To us and our good fortune!

Be happy, be healthy, long life!

And if our good fortune never comes,

Here's to whatever comes,

Drink la kayim, to life!



Heaven bless you both, to your health and may we live

together in peace!

May you both be favored with the future of your choice,

May you live to see a thousand reasons to rejoice!



We'll raise a glass and sip a drop of schnapps in honor of

the great

good luck that favors you,

We know that when good fortune favors two such men, it

stands to reason,

we deserve it too!

To us and our good fortune!

Be happy, be healthy, long life!

And if our good fortune never comes,

Here's to whatever comes,

Drink la kayim, to life!
