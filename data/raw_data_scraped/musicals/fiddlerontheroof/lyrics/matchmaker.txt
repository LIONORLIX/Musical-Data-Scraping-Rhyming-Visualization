Matchmaker


Hodel:

Well, somebody has to arrange the matches,

Young people can't decide these things themselves.



Chava:

She might bring someone wonderful----



Hodel:

Someone interesting----



Chava:

And well off----



Hodel:

And important---



Matchmaker, Matchmaker,

Make me a match,

Find me a find,

catch me a catch

Matchmaker, Matchmaker

Look through your book,

And make me a perfect match



Chava:

Matchmaker, Matchmaker,

I'll bring the veil,

You bring the groom,

Slender and pale.

Bring me a ring for I'm longing to be,

The envy of all I see.



Hodel:

For Papa,

Make him a scholar.



Chava:

For mama,

Make him rich as a king.



Chava and Hodel:

For me, well,

I wouldn't holler

If he were as handsome as anything.



Matchmaker, Matchmaker,

Make me a match,

Find me a find,

Catch me a catch,

Night after night in the dark I'm alone

So find me match,

Of my own.



(spoken)



Tzeitel:

Since when are you in a match, Chava?  I thought you had your eye on your books.



(Hodel chuckles)



Tzeitel con't:

And you have your eye on the Rabbi's son.



Hodel:

Well, why not?

We have only one Rabbi and he has only one son.

Why shouldn't I want the best?



Tzeitel:

Because you're a girl from a poor family.

So whatever Yenta brings, you'll take, right?

Of course right!



(throws scarf over her head, imitating Yenta)

(singing)



Hodel, oh Hodel,

Have I made a match for you!

He's handsome, he's young!

Alright, he's 62.

But he's a nice man, a good catch, true?

True.



I promise you'll be happy,

And even if you're not,

There's more to life than that---

Don't ask me what.



Chava, I found him.

Won't you be a lucky bride!

He's handsome, he's tall,

That is from side to side.

But he's a nice man, a good catch, right?

Right.



You heard he has a temper.

He'll beat you every night,

But only when he's sober,

So you'll alright.



Did you think you'd get a prince?

Well I do the best I can.

With no dowry, no money, no family background

Be glad you got a man!



Chava:

Matchmaker, Matchmaker,

You know that I'm

Still very young.

Please, take your time.



Hodel:

Up to this minute,

I misunderstood

That I could get stuck for good.



Chava and Hodel:

Dear Yenta,

See that he's gentle

Remember,

You were also a bride.

It's not that

I'm sentimental



Chava and Hodel and Tzeitel:

It's just that I'm terrified!



Matchmaker, Matchmaker,

Plan me no plans

I'm in no rush

Maybe I've learned

Playing with matches

A girl can get burned

So,

Bring me no ring

Groom me no groom

Find me no find

Catch me no catch

Unless he's a matchless match.
