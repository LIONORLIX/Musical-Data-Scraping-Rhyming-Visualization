Anatevka


Anatevka, Anatevka

Underfed overworked Anatevka

Where else could sabbath be so sweet?



Anatevka, Anatevka

intimate, obstinate Anatevka

Where I know everyone I meet.



Soon I'll be a stranger in a strange new place

Searching for an old familiar face

from Anatevka



Anatevka, Anatevka

I belong in Anatevka

Dear little village little town of mine
