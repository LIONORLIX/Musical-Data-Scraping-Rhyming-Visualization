Miracle of Miracles


Wonder of wonders, miracle of miracles-

God took up Daniel once again,

Stood by his and side and- miracle of miracles-

Walked him through the lions den!



Wonder of wonders, miracle of miracles-

I was afraid that God would frown,

But like he did so long ago, at Jericho,

God just made a wall fall down!



When Moses softened Pharaohs heart, that was a miracle.

When God made the waters of the red sea part, that was a miracle too!

But of all God's miracles large and small,

The most miraculous one of all

Is that out of a worthless lump of clay,

God has made a man today.



Wonder of wonders, miracle of miracles-

God took the tailor by the hand

Turned him around and- miracle of miracles- Led him to the promised land!



When David slew Goliath (yes!), that was a miracle.

When God gave us manna in the wilderness, that was a miracle too.

But of all God's miracles large and small,

The most miraculous one of all

Is the one I thought could never be:

God has given you to me.
