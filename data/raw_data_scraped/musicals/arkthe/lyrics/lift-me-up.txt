Lift Me Up


ELIZA

WE'LL CRY A THOUSAND TEARS

FOR THOSE WHO STAYED BEHIND



SARIAH

CHOSE TO CLOSE

THEIR EARS



MARTHA

THEIR EYES, THEIR HEARTS,

THEIR MINDS



ELIZA

THE HEAVENS WEEP AND SO SHOULD WE

FOR EVERY SOUL WHO SLIPPED



NOAH

WE?LL LIVE OUR LIVES TO SHOW WE'RE WORTHY OF

THIS GLORIOUS SHIP

THIS HEAVENLY SHIP



SHEM

LIFT ME UP TAKE ME HOME

LIFT ME UP AND HELP ME TO STAND

LIFT ME UP AND CARRY ME

IN THE CUP OF THY HAND



JAPHETH

LIFT ME UP

SOOTHE MY SOUL

LIFT ME UP

AND DRY MY TEARS

LIFT ME UP AND PILOT ME

THROUGH THE OCEAN OF MY FEARS



EGYPTUS

YOU ARE THE CANDLE IN THE DARK

I HAVE FOUND THE LIFE-LINE

COMING INTO THE ARK



ALL (NOT HAM)

HEAL MY BROKEN HEART LIFT ME UP

SO I UNDERSTAND LIFT ME UP

HOW I CAN BE LIFT ME UP

AN ANCHOR FOR THIS MAN



HAM

THERE?S A KNOT IN MY CHEST AND I FEEL IT?S THE PAIN

OF MY FRIENDS THAT ARE LOST IN THE POURING RAIN

AND MY HEART BEATS WITH THEIRS

BUT MY SUFFERING'S IN VAIN

WHAT IS LOST I CAN'T REGAIN

OH THE HEAVENLY PLAN WAS SO WELL ENGINEERED

WITH THE WICKED OUT THERE

AND THE RIGHTEOUS IN HERE

BUT IF GOD'S REALLY UP THERE

HE'S THINKING, "OH DEAR

I'VE SAVED A MUTINEER!"

SO LOCK HIM IN A JAIL CELL IN THE DARK

AND SENTENCE HIM TO SERVE TIME

ON THE ARK

THROW HIM ON BOARD THE ARK





ALL

LIFT ME UP TAKE ME HOME

HAM

THERE'S A KNOT IN MY CHEST

AND I FEEL IT'S THE PAIN

ALL

LIFT ME UP AND HELP ME TO STAND

HAM

OF MY FRIENDS THAT ARE

LOST IN THE POURING RAIN

ALL

LIFT ME UP AND CARRY ME

HAM

AND MY HEART BEATS WITH

THEIRS BUT MY SUFFERING?S

IN VAIN

ALL

IN THE CUP OF THY HAND

HAM

WHAT IS LOST I CAN?T REGAIN

ALL

LIFT ME UP

HAM

OH THE HEAVENLY PLAN WAS

SO WELL ENGINEERED

ALL

SOOTHE MY SOUL

WITH THE WICKED OUT

THERE AND THE RIGHTEOUS IN HERE

ALL

LIFT ME UP AND DRY MY TEARS

LIFT ME UP AND PILOT ME

HAM

BUT IF GOD?S REALLY UP

THERE HE?S THINKING , ?OH DEAR?

ALL

THROUGH THE OCEAN OF MY FEARS

HAM

I?VE SAVED A MUTINEER!

ALL

YOU ARE THE CANDLE IN THE DARK

HAM

SO LOCK HIM IN A JAIL CELL

IN THE DARK

ALL

I HAVE FOUND THE LIFE-LINE

HAM

AND SENTENCE HIM TO

SERVE TIME ON THE ARK

ALL

COMING INTO THE ARK

COMING INTO THE ARK

HAM

THROW HIM ON BOARD THE ARK, THE ARK

ALL
