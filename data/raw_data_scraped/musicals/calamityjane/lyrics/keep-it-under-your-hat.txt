Keep It Under Your Hat


Well, now, if you've got a cutie who's a real sweet patootie

better keep it under your hat

Just remember curiousity in fables of old

Killed the curious cat



Supposin' you love a laddie who's a sweet sugar daddy

Better take in the welcoming mat

Remember there's a dozen dolls for every Dan

You're not the only sweet pea in the can



So, if you wanna know the way to keep your man

Keep it under your hat

Keep it under your hat!



If you wanna know the way to keep your man

Keep it under your hat

Keep it under your hat!



Keep it under your hat!
