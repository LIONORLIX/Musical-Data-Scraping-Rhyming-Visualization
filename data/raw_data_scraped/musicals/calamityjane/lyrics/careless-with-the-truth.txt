Careless With The Truth


CALAMITY:

Did I tell ya 'bout the time that

I was captured by a score or more

Of Cherokee and Chicakasaw,

A-fixin' for to scalp me just fer play.



Well, I just jumped upon a buffalo,

Pulled off his horn and blew it,

So a regiment from Idaho

Come on to save the day.



In honour of me the President put a

Buffalo on the nickel and an Injun on the cent.



[Men]

Ha, ha, ha ,ha,

Ha, ha, ha, ha!



[Bill Hickock]

Tell us another one,

Tell us another one,

Oh my achin' tooth,

She's not exactly lyin',

But she's careless with the truth!



[Bill and Men]

Careless! Careless!

Careless with the truth!

She's not exactly lyin'

But she's careless with the truth!



CALAMITY:

Did I tell ya 'bout the time last week,

I'm herdin' cows at Cripple Creek,

When all at once I see two hungry lookin'

Grizzlies on each side of me.



Well, I just wasn't in the mood to trifle

Grabbin' up my huntin' rifle

I let go with both the barrels,

Neatest shot you see!



One bullet went North the other South,

Shot one of 'em through the tail and shot the other through the mouth!



[Men]

Ha, ha, ha ,ha,

Ha, ha, ha, ha!



[Bill]

Tell us another one,

Tell us another one,

Oh my achin' tooth,

She's not exactly lyin',

But she's careless with the truth!



[Bill and Men]

Careless! Careless!

Careless with the truth!

She's not exactly lyin'

But she's careless with the truth!



[Calamity]

Did I tell ya 'bout the time last fall,

I'm loggin' trees at Lake St. Paul;

And there I see an oak so tall,

T'would take a bird a day to reach the top.



Well, I start swingin' with my trusty axe

And suddenly that oak tree cracks

And up against another smacks

And down they come kerflop!



Believe me or not I tell you pards,

The rest of the forest folded up just like a deck of cards!



[Men]

Ha, ha, ha ,ha,

Ha, ha, ha, ha!



[Bill]

Tell us another one,

Tell us another one,

Oh my achin' tooth,

She's not exactly lyin',

But she's careless with the truth!



[Bill and Men]

Careless! Careless!

Careless with the truth!

She's not exactly lyin'

But she's careless with the truth!
