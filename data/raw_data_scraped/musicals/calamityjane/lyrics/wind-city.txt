Wind City


I just blew in from the windy city

The windy city is mighty purty

But they ain't got what we got, no sirree

They got shacks up to seven storeys

Never see any morning glories

But a step from our doorway

We got 'em fer free



They've got those minstrel shows

Purty ladies in the big chapeaus

Private lawns, public parks

For the sake of civic virtue

They've got fountains there that squirt you



I just blew in from the windy city

The windy city is mighty purty

But they ain't got what we got.

I'm telling you, boys,

We got more life in Deadwood city than in all of Illinois!



On the street was a dancin' feller

All dressed up in a suit of yeller

Aand the dance that he did there

Went somethin' like this...



Whistle! (whistling) More!



(Dance Interlude)



You shoulda seen me a-winder shopping

A-winder shopping with eyes a-poppin'

At the sights that you see there, yes sirree!



Press a bell and a moment later

Up you go in an elevator

Just as fast as a polecat a-climbin' a tree



I heard claim hundreds came

To a thing they call a baseball game!

Cigar stores, revolving doors

Men wear sideburns and they oughter

'Cause a haircut costs a quarter



I just blew in from the windy city,

The windy city is mighty purty

But they ain't got what we got.

I'm tellin' ya, boys

I ain't a-swappin' half of Deadwood for the whole of Illinois!
