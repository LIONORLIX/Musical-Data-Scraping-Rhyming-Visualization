Black Hills Of Dakota


Bill:

Take me back to the Black Hills

The Black Hills  of Dakota

To the beautiful Indian country

That I love



Calamity:

Lost my heart in the Black Hills

The Black Hills of Dakota

Where the pines are so high

That they kiss the sky above



ALL:

And when I get that lonesome feelin'

And I'm miles away from home

I hear the voice of the mystic mountains

Callin' me back home



Calamity & Bill:

So, take me back to the Black Hills

The Black Hills  of Dakota

To the beautiful Indian country

That I love



(Take me back to the Black Hills )

(The Black Hills  of Dakota)

(To the beautiful Indian country)

(That I love)



Bill:

Lost my heart in the Black Hills

Calamity & Bill:

The Black Hills of Dakota

Where the pines are so high

That they kiss the sky above



Calamity & Bill:

And when I get that lonesome feelin'

And I'm miles away from home

I hear the voice of the mystic mountains

Callin' me back home



ALL:

So take me back to the black hills

The black hills of Dakota

To the beautiful Indian country

That I love

Calamity & Bill:

To the beautiful Indian country

That I love
