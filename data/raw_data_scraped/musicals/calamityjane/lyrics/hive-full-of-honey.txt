Hive Full Of Honey


I've got two wonderful arms

I've got two wonderful lips

I'm over twenty one, and I'm free!

Oh, I've got a hive full o' honey

For the right kind of honey bee



I'm not the glamorous type

But I'm the amorous type

You'll love the way I fit on your knee.

Oh, I've got a hive full o' honey

for the right kind of honey bee



My daddy owns a railroad

and my ma is a millionaire

and besides I'm an only child

Do you think you could learn to care?



If you're the one I adore

Come on and get it before

Somebody shakes it down from the tree.

I've got a hive full o' honey

For the right kind of honey bee

..

I got two wonderful arms

I got two wonderful lips

I'm over twenty one, and I'm free!

Oh, I've got a hive full o' honey

For the right kind of honey bee!
