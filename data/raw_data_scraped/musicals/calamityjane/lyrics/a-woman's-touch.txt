A Woman's Touch


Katie: A woman's touch

Calamity: A woman's touch

Katie: The magic of Aladdin couldn't do as much

Katie: She's a wizard, she's a champ

Calamity: And she doesn't need a lamp



Katie:

A woman's touch can weave a spell

The kind of hocus pocus that she does so well

Calamity:

With the magic of a broom

She can mesmerize a room



Katie:

With a whisk whisk here and a whisk whisk there

And a dustpan for the cinders

Calamity:

With a rub rub here and a rub rub there

She can polish up the winders

Then presto chango

Suddenly, the sun comes shining through

Katie:And what does Mr Sunshine say to you?

Calamity: Howdy-do!



Katie: It makes you blink, to stop and think

Calamity: A woman and a whisk-broom can accomplish so darn much

BOTH: So never underestimate a woman's touch



Calamity:

A woman's touch can quickly fill

The empty flower boxes on a winder sill

Katie:

One smile from her and zoom

Little buds begin to bloom



Katie: A touch of paint

Calamity: A magic nail

BOTH: Can turn a kitchen chair into a Chippendale

Calamity:

Even make the lamp appear

Like a crystal chandelier

Katie:

With a tack tack here and a tack tack there

And a hand around a hammer

With a mop mop here and a mop mop there

You can give a cabin glamour



Calamity:

Then gosh almighty, all at once

The cabin that we knew

Becomes a shining castle built for two

BOTH: Me and you



Katie:

The pies and cakes a woman bakes

Can make a fella tell her

That he loves her very much

Calamity: It can?

BOTH: So never underestimate a woman's touch
