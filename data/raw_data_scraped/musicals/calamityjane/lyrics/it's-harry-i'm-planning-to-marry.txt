It's Harry I'm Planning To Marry


When you turn to the subject of Harry

That's a horse from a different safari.

He can box like a fox, he's as dumb as an ox

But it's Harry I'm planning to marry



(Yes, it's Harry she's plannin' to marry)



My heart's twined around his suspenders

He's the one that I truly adore

I'm numb, I succumb when he renders

The face on the bar room floor



When he flexes his muscles, I flutter

Like a butterfly caught in a shutter

When he calls me his mate

I just disintegrate



Since the world first began (Since the world first began)

Never been such a man (Never been such a man)

Who could love like he can

So it's Harry I'm planning to marry!
