Great Big Stuff


FREDDY

I thought I'd seen it all,

I thought I knew the score.

But coming here, I've found a world

I'd never seen before.

Now I know Where I belong-

A life of taste and class

With culture and sophisitication

pouring out my ass.



Gimme

Great Big Stuff



This is how I gotta live-



Great Big Stuff



Uh-uh no alternative-



Great big stuff



I want my silver spoon.

Don't need it right now

But I better get it soon.



I want a mansion with a moat

Around which I will float

With some vast-bottom babies

In my glass-bottom boat.



FREDDY/HOUSEKEEPERS

A house in the Bahamas-



FREDDY

Paisley silk pajamas-

Poker with Al Roker

And our friend Lorenzo Lamas.

Gimme-



FREDDY/ENSMBLE

Great Big Stuff



FREDDY

I really do deserve it.



FREDDY/ENSEMBLE

Great Big Stuff



FREDDY

With servants who will serve it.



FREDDY/ENSEMBLE

Great Big Stuff



FREDDY

I don't give a damn what it's fer,

Every day's my birthday,

Every night is my Bar Mitzver.



Oh give me a home

Where the centerfolds roam

Guccione on the phone,he

got a party going on-

And Hef'll have me over

To play some naked Twister

Blotto in the Grotto

With a Playmate and her sister.



ENSEMBLE

Great Big Stuff



FREDDY

Rap stars'll love me!



ENSEMBLE

Great Big Stuff



FREDDY

Get me a posse! A'ight!



ENSEMBLE

Great Big Stuff



FREDDY

Chillin'in the city,

Sittin' pretty in the Caddy

With P. Daddy or Puff Diddy



-or whatever!

I'll change my name too!

I'll get my hatchback all pimped-out.



The Islands in the winter

The Hamptons in the summer,

The fashion plate I date'll give me

Hummers in my Hummer.



The cash to keep me idle,

The chicks to keep me vital,

The pills to keep me happy

Even when I'm suicidal.



ENSEMBLE

Great big stuff



FREDDY

Nothin crass or crappy-



ENSEMBLE

Great Big Stuff



FREDDY

That would make me very happy.



ENSEMBLE

Great Big Stuff



FREDDY

Bring it out and make it snappy.



ENSEMBLE

Great Big Stuff



FREDDY

I want some really classy shit-



ENSEMBLE

Great Big Stuff



FREDDY

Like a mink tracksuit-



ENSEMBLE

Great Big Stuff



FREDDY

My own personal Zamboni-



ENSEMBLE

Great Big Stuff



FREDDY

Lot's of unnecessary surgery-



ENSEMBLE

Great Big Stuff



FREDDY

I can finally afford to see a Broadway

show!



ENSEMBLE

Great Big stuff



FREDDY

Gout.



ENSEMBLE

Great Big,

Great Big,

Great Big ,

Great Big Stuff-



FREDDY

I just want someone to

Love me...

For my money



ALL
