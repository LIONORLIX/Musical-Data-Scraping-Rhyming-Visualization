What Was A Woman To Do


MURIEL

Last night I met a man beneath a pale

And haunted moon-

A man no womand could refuse.

Bold and assertive with a

Furtive air of mystery.

Magically long of lash,

Tragically short of cash.



As he approached he wore

An aura of nobility.

I wore these Ferragamo shoes.

This was at last, I knew, my

Rendezvous with History.

What was a woman,

What was a woman to do?



And when he smiled he lit the night

With grance and confidence.

His teeth were clean and straight and

white just like a picket fence.

I couldn't look directly at them-

They were that intense.

What was a woman,

What was a woman to do?'



I never realized hwo long

My hear had been ignored.

He sany my name and it rang out just

Like some major chord.

If music be he food of love,

He ate my Smorgasbord.

What was a woman-



WOMAN #1

What was a woman-



WOMAN # 2

What was a woman to do?



WOMEN

Last night I met a prince

And suddenly my life has changed-

I have a purpose and a cause

(to help my dreamy royal boyfiend.)



MURIEL

He's off rebelling,

And i'm kveling here,

But never mind.



WOMAN #2

He's just so- ooo!



WOMAN #3

So suave itmakes you mental



MURIEL

So goddamn continental



WOMEN

Who'd guess that I would be the only

one to whom he'd turn-

This man of brio

And panache



MURIEL

He gave me romance and the feeling

I was young again.



WOMAN#1

I gave him hope and strength and



WOMEN

A check made out to cash.



USHERETTE

He had the most amazing eyes

That I had ever seen.

He came in with a ticket

For the Second Mezzanine.

I ripped it up and put him right down

there in J-13.



MURIEL

Miss? If you don't mind...



USHERETTE

What was a woman-



WOMEN

What was a woman-



MURIEL

What was a woman to do?
