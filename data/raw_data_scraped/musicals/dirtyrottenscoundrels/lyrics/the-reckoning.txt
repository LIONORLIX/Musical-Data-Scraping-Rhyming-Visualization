The Reckoning


LAWRENCE

How could you do that to her?



FREDDY

Do what to her?



We're in her room,

The lights are low.

I've got it made,

All systems go.



I'm in. She's down-

The hair; the gown-

We go to kiss;

She conks me out.



Then I wake up

With nothing on.

She took my clothes.

My shoes are gone.



My wallet's gone.

My watch is gone.

And here I am a shmuch in a robe.



LAWRENCE

And you expect me to believe that

when she just returned the fifty

thousand dollars I gave to her?



FREDDY

What fifty thousand dollars?



LAWRENCE

The fifty thousand dollars that you

stole from her!



FREDDY

I didn't steal and fifty thousand dollars

from her!



(They look at each other

and run to the briefcase)



Hey, there's my clothes.



(They find a note inside and read:)



CHRISTINE'S VOICE

'Goodbye boys. It was fun.

Love, The Jackal!



FREDDY

The more I cired,

The more she cared.

The more I liked,

The more she bared.

The more I sang,

The more she sung.

I mean, come on,

She gave me tongue!



ANDRE

Amazing

Zis idot.

I hate to say i told you so-



LAWRENCE

Amazing.

The Timing,

She really had me down-



ANDRE

So young, so good,

So right, so nice.

She played you like a pair of dice



LAWRENCE

The eyes, the smile,

The joy, the hope,

The hair, the clothes



ANDRE

Ze soap!



ALL

The soap!



LAWRENCE

The soap!



FREDDY

That lousy, stinking, lying, cheating,

totally dishonest, dirty, rotten-



LAWRENCE

Yes Freddy, isn't she wonderful!
