Like Zis/Like Zat


ANDRE

Like zis- ze moon,

As round as a balloon

Suspended like a bauble in ze sky.

Like zat- a tune

Zat wafts above the dune

And sweetly flutters like a

butterfly.

If ze past were plus parfait

We'd have met another day

When we both were young and

gay

And thin,

But the presen't rather tense,

So i think it makes some sense

For us to both

Give up,

Give in.



Like zat-ze sky

A shooting star goes by-

A message you and I

Cannot dismiss.



So I'm wishing for adose

Of being nice and close

Like zis, like zat, like dis.



MURIEL

Of the future,who can tell,

Though we hope it turns out well

No one can know just when his bell

Will toll,



So let's live in the here and now

And let it show us how

To find a way

To lose control.



Like zat, ze rose,

Delightful to ze nose,

But nowhere near

As perfect as a kiss-



ANDRE

And though I am no prance-



MURIEL

No prince.



ANDRE

My looks may make you wance-



MURIEL

No, wince.



ANDRE

I offer you romance-



MURIEL

Ro-mince.



ANDRE

Aah!

Come on, let's dince.



(As they dance:)



We've never been introduced.



MURIEL

I'm Muriel of Omaha.



ANDRE

Pleased to meet you.



MURIEL

It's mutual.



ANDRE

Like zat-



MURIEL

Ze rose-



ANDRE

Delightful to ze nose-



ANDRE AND MURIEL

But nowhere near

As perfect as a kidd.



(They kiss)



MURIEL

I like ziS.



ANDRE

You like zat?



MURIEL

I like zat.



ANDRE

So do I.



MURIEL

I like zis-



ANDRE AND MURIEL

Like zis.
