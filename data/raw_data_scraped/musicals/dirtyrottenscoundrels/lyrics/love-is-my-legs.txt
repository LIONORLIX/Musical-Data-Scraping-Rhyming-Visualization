Love Is My Legs


FREDDY

I was alone and cold and damp,

I tried to fly

But both my wings would cramp

'Til you came along and lit the lamp

To guide me to my exit ramp.



Love is my legs and you are my love

So you are my legs, my love.

Finally I understand

How hope is the hand

That squeezes a heart

And helps it to start once again.



CHRISTINE

Now stand up and walk to me.



FREDDY

I can't.



CHRISTINE

YOU CAN!



Faith are the toes

Attatched to your feet

So I'll be your feet completely,

Always there to strive in your socks,

Alive in your socks,

No longer dejected,

Two feet resurrected-

Connected to legs which is love-



FREDDY

Love is my legs!



CHRISTINE

Stand up. come to me!



Love is your legs!



FREDDY

Oh my God, I'm standing! I'm standing!



FREDDY/CHRISTINE

Love is my/your legs.



CHRISTINE

Now come to me, soldier.



FREDDY

I'm still afraid.



CHRISTINE

I know you can do it.

Please try.



(Freddy takes a few faltering steps

and staggers towards her.)



FREDDY

I did it. I'm walking!



CHRISTINE

Do you want to rest?



FREDDY

No, I want to keep going. My legs are

full of love. Stand over there.



CHRISTINE

(Moving towards the bed)

Here?



FREDDY

Further.



CHRSTINE

How far do you want to go?



FREDDY

All the way!



Love is my legs

And you are my love

So you are my

feet-bones of love.



CHRISTNE/CHOIR

The leg-bone's

Connected to ankle-bones



Connected to

Feet-bones of love.



FREDDY/CHRISTINE

Help me scrape the

Rust from my heart,

Blow the

Dust from my heart

Then help me adjust

To the trust

That you thrust

In my heart

With your legs full of-



CHRISTINE/CHOIR

-Love is your legs-



FREDDY

It was all in my head-



CHRISTINE/CHOIR

Love is your legs-



FREDDY

Now you get on that bed!



CHRISTINE/CHOIR

Love is your legs-



FREDDY

Here I come!

Hope is your hand.



CHRISTINE

Faith is your feet.



FREDDY

Love is my legs.



CHRISTINE

Love is your legs



FREDDY/CHRISTINE

Love is my/your legs.
