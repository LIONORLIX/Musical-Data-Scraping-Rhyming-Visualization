Chimp In A Suit


ANDRE

Dress up a monkey in Armani,

He may seem precocious and cute.

Despite all that primpin',

You still got a chimp in a suit.



Teach him the second

Verse of  "Swanee"

And most of "Moon River" to boot.

Sure peopl will gape

But you still got an ape

in a suit.



Shprizt him 'til wet

With the Eau de Toilette

And you're still gonna get

A stench.

Dampen him well

In a quart of Chanel,

It won't cover the smell-

I should know, I'm French!



Take him to see Don Giovanni,

Show him Cezanne's lovely fruit,

Teach him to cook

>From Escoffier's book,

He's still a gorrila en croute-

You still got a chimp in a suit.



So you've shaved off his fur,

Decked him out in couture

And endowed him with pure

Savior Fare-

You dressed him up fancy

And trained him to dance, he

Remains a chimpan-cee,



He's not Fred Astaire!

Give him a dandy little topper,

Tie on a natty cravat

Buy him a castle,

He'll still be an asshole

And nothing you do will change

that-



He's still just a stinky little minkey

In a dinky little suit

And a cheap little hat!
