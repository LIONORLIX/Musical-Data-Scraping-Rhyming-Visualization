Oklahoma?


JOLENE

Down in the Panhandle

Where we manhandle

All that beef cattle

And the snakes rattle

And the wind whistles

Through the dead thistles,

It's a little piece of heaven



With a big house'n

Lots of big cows'n

Lots of big sky'n

Lots of dust flyin'

And I'll be so happy since

I'm bringing hime a prince

To my little piece of heaven,

Oklahoma.



Don't you love it when the

bobcats howl?



Don't you love it when the

coyotes cough?



Well, I know a few tricks

With a thirty ought-six

'n you can watch me blow those little

fuckers heads clean off.



And then, oh boy-

We'll go two steppin-

Through the arroyo,

Watch what you step in



'Cause them cattle eat their share

And it's gotta go somewhere

In my little piece of heaven,

Oklahoma.



And we'll motor into Tulsa for the

weeken'-

Through the windows of the pickup

we'll be peekin'-

Not a tree or a Jew

To block the lovely vie.

There's a race track and a zoo-



ENSEMBLE

And Oral Roberts U!



JOLENE

And we'll dress you up nifty

In a big Stetson

With some SPF 50

So no sun gets in



'Cause that freckly on your skin

Can do a feller in

And the shade is mighty thin in

Oklahoma

And our leading cause of death

is Melanoma



ENSEMBLE

Melanoma!



Hyah!
