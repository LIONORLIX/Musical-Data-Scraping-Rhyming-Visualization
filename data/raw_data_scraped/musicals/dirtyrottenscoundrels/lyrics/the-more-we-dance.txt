The More We Dance


LAWRENCE

That squishy little wishy-washy

Crazy little strudel

In his noodle

Makes him lazy in the legs.



So how can we affect his soul,

Direct his soul

To make him whole's

The queestion that his situation begs.

Way down deep there at the root he

Really wants to shake his booty

So I think here's what our duty

With him is-



Find a way we can convince his mind

To send a signal down the spine

To the behind,

Where all the rhythm is.



The more we dance,

The more he sees,

The more we tease,

The more he burns,

The more he years

To move his knees

Like Cyd Charisse,

The more he learns



That life is bursting with joy, so live it.

Here it is boy, so give it a chance!



The more we dance,

The more we done,

The more he'll whine,

The more he'll pout

Until he fin'lly bottoms out

And then he'll rise and he'll shine and

He'll prance- so let's dance!



(They now join other couples

dancing along the romantic spots

of the Riviera.)



The more we laugh,

The more we grin,

The more he'll have

To join right inm

The more we glow

And show our joy,

The more I'm sure

We'll cure the boy.



It isn't easy to put him through it-

Remember, we do it on his behalf.



So let's guf-far

In his guf-face

While we im-bibe

And we im-brace,

No more 'I don'ts,'

No more 'I won'ts,'

No more more 'I can'ts.'



So let's dance!



I have an idea. Love put him in that

chair, perhaps love can get him out

of it.



CHRISTINE

What do you mean?



LAWRENCE

The more we squeeze

The more we kiss



CHRISTINE

You mean like this?



(She kisses him deeply

in the name of science.)



LAWRENCE

Gott im Himmel.



CHRISTINE

Was that all right?



LAWRENCE

Ja...Wunderbar.



We must be cruel to fuel his desire.

Let's put another log on the fire-



Come on, let's jump! Let's dip!

Maybe that chump will get a grip.

The Macarana will make him saner

As we say in Vienna-



ALL

Ole!



The more we flirt,

the more overt,

The more his heart

Will start to hurt

And this insert

A lot of ants

Into his pants
