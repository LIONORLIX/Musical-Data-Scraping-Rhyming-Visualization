Love Sneaks In


LAWRENCE

Love sneaks in

When everything seems quiet,

Set the bait

And like a fool you buy it.

Your famous self-possession's

Vanished from your repertoire-

This is what can happen when you

Leave the door ajar..



And love sneaks in

And whispers to you sweetly

Silly words that change your life

completely.



You're fumbling in the dark.

The master's now the mark.

You're out of luck

If love sneaks in on you.



The player has been nicely played

The mocker's now the mocked-

That's what tends to happen when

You leave the door unlocked.



And love sneaks through

The usual defenses.,

The sighs, th smirks

That state the old pretenses.

What's gone is what you were.

What's left is all a blur.

You're stung, you're stuck

For love snuck in with her.
