The Miracle


CHRISTINE

And when it seems

Your hopes and dreams

Are on the run again,



Bad luck has won again

And it won't stop-



The clouds wil part

And you will start.

To see the sun again.

And life's a ball, you're standing tall,

You've found your way back to the

top-



Breath in and taste the ocean

breeze.

Look at the way the leaves are

Dancing in the banyan trees.

Listen to what they are singing to

you-

Nothing is too wonderful-



FREDDY

Nothing is too wonderful-



CHRISTINE/FREDDY

Nothing is too wonderful to be-



(Down in the hotel lobby Andre

whispers to a Bellboy)

(Meanhile back in the hotel suite...)



CHRISTINE

Oh, Sergeant Benson it will happen,

you'll se.



FREDDY

Gosh, Sergeant Benson just sounds

so formal. Please, call me Buzz.



CHRISTINE

Alright...Buzz.



(Christine runs down to the hotel

lobby and moves to the front desk.)



Excuse me! Pardom me! Please!

I ahve to mail this urgent letter

overnight to Vienna!



BELLBOY

Paging the doctor...



Paging Dr. Shuffhausen-



Paging Dr. Emil Shuffhausen-

Of Vienna.



(Christine stops in surprise and runs

back to Freddy in her hotel suite:)

(The door opens and Lawrence enters

with a smile and a Viennese accent:)
