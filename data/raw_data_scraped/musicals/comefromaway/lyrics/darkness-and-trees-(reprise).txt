Darkness and Trees (Reprise)


GARTH (spoken)

Finally, out of the darkness, my bus arrives at

The Salvation Army camp



ALL EXCEPT GARTH AND MUHUMUZA

Kati ya giza



MUHUMUZA (spoken)

We pass through a large gate and the bus pulls

To a stop. And through the windows — out

There in the darkness — we see all these people

Coming out of the buildings



ALL

Ghafla mwangaza



GARTH (spoken)

We rarely use them, but everyone’s dusted off their

Salvation Army uniforms to welcome these people



MUHUMUZA (spoken)

There are soldiers everywhere



ALL

Pande zote sisi



MUHUMUZA (spoken)

The man at the front opens the door



GARTH (spoken)

I say, “Here you are. Out you go.” But he

Doesn’t understand. And he’s not getting off

None of them are



ALL

Giza na miti



GARTH (spoken)

But then I notice his wife — well, she’s

Clutching a bible. Now, obviously I can’t read

It, but their bible — it’ll have the same number

System ours does — so I ask to see it

And I’m searching for something and then in

Philippians 4:6. I give ‘em their bible and I’m

Pointing, saying, look! Philippians 4:6 — Be

Anxious for nothing. Be anxious for nothing



GARTH & MUHUMUZA (spoken)

And that’s how we started speaking the same

Language



ALL

Kati ya giza

(Out of the darkness)

Ghafla mwangaza

(Suddenly brightness)

Ma-badiliko

(Everything changes)

Giza na miti

(Darkness and trees)

Kati ya giza

(Out of the darkness)

Ma-badiliko

(Suddenly light)



All                                  Out of the darkness

Kati ya giza                     Suddenly brightness

Ghafla mwangaza            Everything changes

Ma-badiliko                     Darkness and trees

Giza na miti                     Out of the darkness

Kati ya giza                     Suddenly light

Ma-badiliko
