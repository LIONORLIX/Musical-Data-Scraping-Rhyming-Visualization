On The Bus


Climb aboard!



Hop right in, me ducky!



Let’s get you where you’re going.



You’ve all seen the airport. Used to be the busiest airport in North America.

Planes used to stop here to gas up from everywhere.



Whoo! Frank Sinatra, Albert Einstein--



Mohammed Ali



The Queen!



Then they invented jet planes that can get across the ocean on one tank--



So there’s no need to refuel anymore.



Leavin’ us with this giant airport.



Now there’s the reason I drive slow.



That there in the middle of the road?



Yah. That’s a moose.



She’ll move when she’s good and ready.



NICK

Mind if I sit here?



DIANE

Oh, hello Nick! I thought we’d lost you.



NICK

No, I just needed to get an emergency prescription. Nothing serious.

It’s not like “Oh, my god, he’s off his medication!” I’ll stop talking now.



DIANE

It’s fine.



NICK

Any news yet about your husband, who was flying today?



DIANE

My--no. Do you mind if we just don’t talk about that? I haven’t been able to get to a phone.



NICK

I’m sorry. I’ll help you find a phone as soon as we get--wherever we’re going.
