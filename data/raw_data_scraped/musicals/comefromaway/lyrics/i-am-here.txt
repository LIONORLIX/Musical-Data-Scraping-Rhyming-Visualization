I Am Here


"I'm Here" is a song from Come From Away the Musical performed by Q. Smith (Hannah).



Narrator:

Anyway, I get lunch set up labeling anything that will go bad with a date and time.

I leave a pot out for one of the pilots who's been enjoying our cookin'.

I make a balloon animal for a crying toddler and then I check on Hannah,

Leaving messages for anyone she can reach.



Hannah:

I am here, I am here on an island.

Hello? Hello? It's me again, yeah.

My son, He's with rescue 2, any news?

I am his mother, I'm far away stuck here,

I am trying to find out - fine, I'll hold again



I should be down there and checking the hospitals,

Putting up signs, doing something, instead, I am here.

I am here in Canada.

I am telling you, listen, my son he takes risks, he's not missing.

He's helping or hurt. He'll get out of this. Yes, I'll keep trying.

Yes, here's the number, and Yes at Collegian and Gander, I'll be right here.



I should be there when It's over and done.

When he comes through the door and says, I'm home mom.

I should be there for my son but instead, I am here. I am here.



Narrator:

She leaves message after message for her son

until there's no more room on his answering machine.



Hannah:

All I know is you are there. You are there and I am here...
