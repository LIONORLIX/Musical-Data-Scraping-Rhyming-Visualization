28 Hours/Wherever We Are


BEVERLEY (spoken)

When you include the original flight, we were on the plane for twelve...thirteen hours



MAN (spoken)

We were on there fifteen hours



MAN (spoken)

Twenty hours



MAN (spoken)

Twenty-eight hours. We were on the plane for over an entire day



COMPANY

Twenty-eight hours

Over an entire day

There was one aisle in the middle

Everyone knew every inch of that plane



MAN (spoken)

We were allowed out of our seats, but not off the plane



MAN (spoken)

You never think about it, but airplane doors are twenty feet in the air



MAN (spoken)

And even if you survived the jump, they probably would have shot you

ADVERTISEMENT



MAN (spoken)

You can go up to first class. You can stretch in the aisles



MAN (spoken)

There are three seats on each side and there was only one aisle in the middle



MAN (spoken)

Everyone knew every inch of that plane



WOMAN (spoken)

Our flight was full! There were children sleeping on the floor



WOMAN (spoken)

We had no way to get information



MAN (spoken)

This is before most people had mobile phones. And only a couple people got through



MAN (spoken)

Hello?



MAN (spoken)

Mom!



WOMAN (spoken)

Bonjour?



WOMAN (spoken)

Operator?



BEVERLEY

Tom?

Oh, thank God!

I finally got through

I borrowed a passenger's phone

How are you?

Are the kids okay?

No, I'm fine Tom

I'm fine

Safe and sound on the ground here in Newfoundland

We don't know much except for the BBC

Listen

I can't talk long

Can you do something for me?



MAN (spoken)

I'm okay



MAN (spoken)

I'm fine



WOMAN (spoken)

Vais bien



WOMAN (spoken)

Pick up!



BEVERLEY

Tell the kids I'm alright

Take them into the kitchen

And show them the map

That we used to put pins in

For each destination

That we flew together

Tell them that I'm fine

Put a pin here in Gander



NICK (spoken)

On our plane, someone has a cell phone



MAN (spoken)

But then the battery dies



MAN (spoken)

There are phones in the backs of the seats



WOMAN (spoken)

But they don't work!



WOMAN (spoken)

Half of the passengers on our plane don't speak English!



MAN (spoken)

Even if we knew what was happening, we don't speak their language



MAN (spoken)

On our plane, we asked the flight attendants



WOMAN (spoken)

But the captain says not to say too much, and that's when rumors start flying



WOMAN (spoken)

There's an accident



MAN (spoken)

An accident?



MAN (spoken)

The US airspace is closed



MAN (spoken)

For the first time in history



MAN (spoken)

Why won't she tell us what's happening?



MAN (spoken)

A helicopter crashed in Pennsylvania



WOMAN (spoken)

A helicopter crashed into a building



MAN (spoken)

Oh my god! It's World War III!



MAN

Meanwhile on our plane



MAN

We didn't have a clue



MAN

We were all going insane because



COMPANY

There wasn't squat to do



MAN

Then the captain starts apologizing

Says on behalf of the airline

He's giving each and everyone some



COMPANY

Complimentary booze!

Open the airplane doors

Wave at all the cars

Hello to whoever you are

Wherever we are



WOMAN (spoken)

The ground crews supplied whatever we needed



MAN (spoken)

Nicotine patches



MAN (spoken)

Medication



WOMAN (spoken)

Pampers



COMPANY

Something to drink!



MAN

So the flight attendants brought out

All the mini-bottles of liquor

And delivered them to everyone



COMPANY

Soon everyone got friendlier



MAN

I took a couple of pictures of the view there in my camera

We didn't know where we were

But we knew that we were hammered



COMPANY

Open the airplane doors

Wave at all the locals

Surely there's something better to do than park

Wherever we are



KEVIN JUNG (spoken)

We'd been sitting there for fourteen hours when we pull out the Grey Goose



KEVIN TUERFF (spoken)

Kevin and I were kinda hiding it because...



KEVIN JUNG (spoken)

...Because we didn't want to share it. Anyway, this woman,

this hot mess behind us, kept completely freaking out



WOMAN (spoken)

I don't understand why they can't let us off. I mean, just to stretch our legs?!

I mean, really? I need to get some air! Oh, my God, I need to get off this plane!



KEVIN TUERFF (spoken)

And my boyfriend Kevin. We're both named Kevin. It was cute for a while.

Anyway, Kevin was not dealing with it well



KEVIN (spoken)

I'm going to kill her



WOMAN (spoken)

Excuse me?! I would like to get off the plane. I am claustrophobic!



KEVIN (spoken)

Excuse me, would you like some Xanax? Because you are freaking out and

it is freaking me out and we are all freaking the fuck out



COMPANY

Open the airplane doors

Let a little air in here

Cause I could use a shower or a bar

(Or a bar)

Open the airplane doors

Look at all the planes out there

There must be a convention it's bizarre

Wherever we are



Twenty-eight hours

(Twenty-eight hours)

Out of the window

Twenty-eight hours

(Twenty-eight hours)

Nothing but darkness

Twenty-eight hours

(Twenty-eight hours)

Darkness and headlights

Twenty-eight hours

(Twenty-eight hours)

Nothing to see



WOMAN (spoken)

The flight attendants keep telling us nothing's wrong. When, I've got kids,

and I've got grandkids, I know when someone's hiding something.

And when parents need their kids to stop asking questions, they start playing movies



WOMAN (spoken)

We ran through every movie we had: Legally Blonde, Doctor Doolittle 2, and...Titanic



WOMAN

Near, far, wherever you



COMPANY

Nothing to do

Nothing to see

Thank god we stopped at the duty-free

Wherever we are



NICK (spoken)

Do you mind if I sit? I need to get to work

and there's some drunk people at the back of the plane singing at the top of their lungs



DIANE (spoken)

No, of course. I'm Diane



NICK (spoken)

Nick. How are you doing?



DIANE (spoken)

I'm...worried about someone. He was flying today.

I just wish there was some way to tell him where I am



NICK (spoken)

Newfoundland. Oh, no, you know that. You just can't tell him. Right. I'm hoping

you're one of those people who laughs when English people say awkward things



DIANE (spoken)

I just wish we knew what was happening



WOMAN (spoken)

What's happening?



WOMAN (spoken)

What's happening?



COMPANY

Somewhere in between



DIANE (spoken)

Your life



NICK (spoken)

And your work



COMPANY

When the world may be falling apart

And you think



DIANE

I'm alone



NICK

I'm alone



NICK & DIANE

And I'm so damn helpless



COMPANY

There's nothing left to do but drink



WOMAN

We open the airplane doors

Flash all the cars

Wooh!

I've never done that before



COMPANY

Twenty-eight hours

God! Over an entire day

Running out of things to say

And if there's someone

Going to clue us in

Tell us all what's happening

Because the sun is setting

And we're sitting in the dark

Wherever we are



MAN (spoken)

Later that night, I'm up in the cockpit with some of the other passengers

when the pilot puts the radio on over the intercom,

and the whole plane goes silent when the president gives his speech



GEORGE W. BUSH (spoken)

I ask the American people to join me in saying thanks for all the folks

who've been fighting hard to rescue our fellow citizens

and to join me in saying a prayer for the victims and their families.

The resolve of our great nation is being tested, but, make no mistake,

we will show the world that we will pass this test. God bless



BEVERLEY

You got through to the airline

Tom, I'm okay

Tell me what's happening out there

How bad is it?

Tom, tell me everything

Tom, who was in the air?

No, no I wouldn't have known them

No, no one on that airline

Charles?! Are you sure?

No, I'm fine Tom

I'm fine
