The Dover Fault


Diane:

We're told by our pilot to stay close to our shelters so we're ready to go again

So we end up on one last walk to this gorgeous lookout, the Dover Fault



Nick:

There's about a million stairs



Diane:

It's beautiful, Nick! You gotta see this!



Nick:

What?



Diane:

I can't believe we're here!



Nick:

I know



Diane:

I can't believe we're leaving.



Nick:

I don't want to go.



Diane:

What did you say?



Nick:

Oh, I don't know. I'm going to get a picture or two



Diane:

Oh, okay
