Lead Us Out Of the Night


BEULAH (spoken)

Welcome to Gander Academy — I'm gonna

Show you now to your rooms, and then if you

Want to come back, we’ve got two TVs set up in

The cafeteria with the news on — so you can see

What's actually happened for yourself…



JANICE (spoken)

I didn’t even think — they haven't seen any of it yet



ALL

Lead us out of the darkness



HANNAH (spoken)

We’re all staring at those images



BEULAH (spoken)

And we just stand helpless watching them



ALL

Lead us somewhere to safety



BOB (spoken)

We barely know where we are. But we know it's not there



ALL

Lead us far from disaster



BEVERLEY (spoken)

Charles Burlingame was the captain of Flight 77 that crashed into the Pentagon.

I just saw him at a pub in London. You can’t imagine.

A pilot will fight to the ends of the earth to save his airplane. He just will



ALL

Lead us out of the night



KEVIN TUERFF (spoken)

We watch those images for hours
