CLAUDE (spoken)

September 12th. Crisis counselors are called to Gander Academy



BEULAH (spoken)

The plane people — they’re exhausted — but they don’t want to sleep.

And we’re standing there, ready with all that food. But that’s not

What they wanted. They wanted phones



JANICE (spoken)

1:45 a.m. — Six phones are put on tables for

The Plane People to use free of charge

— lined up alongside the road by the Newtel Building



BEULAH (spoken)

An hour later, they set up 20 more phones



CLAUDE (spoken)

An hour after that, there’s 75 phones and computers

With internet — all being used ‘round the clock
