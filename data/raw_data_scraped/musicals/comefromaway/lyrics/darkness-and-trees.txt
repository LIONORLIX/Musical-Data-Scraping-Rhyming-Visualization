Darkness and Trees


BOB (spoken)

We can see them from the plane -

this long line of headlights coming through the darkness



ALL

Off of the airplane



FLIGHT ATTENDANT (spoken)

Ladies and gentlemen, you can take only your carry-on items.

Any checked luggage will remain in the hold



ALL

Into the airport



DIANE (spoken)

The captain and flight attendants tell everyone

to take the blankets and pillows off the plane



ALL

Out of the windows



KEVIN (spoken)

We grab bottles of water too - no one has any idea where they're taking us



ALL

Darkness and trees



BOB (spoken)

As we enter the airport, all those car lights are still aimed at us



HANNAH (spoken)

We're scared. They're probably scared too



FLIGHT ATTENDANT (spoken)

The people here don't know what to expect off of these planes



KEVIN (spoken)

The airport looks like something left over from the Cold War. Kevin is like:

Oh my god. We've gone back in time



BOB (spoken)

The whole procedure - the soldiers and all the formality -

it just makes me really nervous



BEVERLEY (spoken)

There's a giant map on the wall of the airport

and someone has written in red marker, "You are here."



DIANE (spoken)

Excuse me. I need to find a phone. I need to call my son



CUSTOMS OFFICER (spoken)

I'm sorry. The pay phones are out of order



OZ (spoken)

They're all lined up at the airport pay phones

So eventually we put an "Out of Order"

sign on them just so we can get people on the busses



CLAUDE (spoken)

11:48 pm. Busses and driver are now taking passengers to shelters,

not just in Gander, but also to Gambo, Appleton,

and farther communities of Lewisporte, Norris Arm, and Glenwood



COMPANY

Our bus sits there forever

While all the others leave

Finally, this other passenger gets on

This guy from the Middle East

Someone says he got questioned

Some says he got searched

And now he's on our bus



JANICE (spoken)

I try to interview the Red Cross, the Salvation Army -

but they've got more important things to do than talk to me.

That's when I see them, the Plane People, through the bus windows.

The terror on their faces. They have no idea where they're going



BEVERLEY (spoken)

They take me and my crew in a separate van and I'm looking out the window,

trying to see where we are, but it is pitch dark.

I've flown over this area hundreds and hundreds of times. And it is just darkness -

hardly and lights anywhere. And now here I am. Oh my god, this is just so remote



MEN

Into the darkness



WOMEN

Stars and the moonlight



MEN

But all around us



WOMEN

Nothing but darkness



MEN

Out of the windows



WOMEN

Into the darkness



ALL

Darkness and trees



GARTH (spoken)

Every school bus we got is goin' back and forth all night. Out to the Salvation Army Camp,

we've delivered passengers from Germany, England, and France.

And around 3 in the morning, my bus is designated to take

all these African people out there. So we starts driving into the darkness



ALL except GARTH and MUHUMUZA

Into the darkness



MUHUMUZA (spoken)

My family and I try to see out the bus windows. No one tells us where we are going



ALL except GARTH and MUHUMUZA

Onto a gravel road



GARTH (spoken)

Silence comes on the bus. We get outside of Gander and you could hear a pin drop



ALL except GARTH and MUHUMUZA

And all around us



MUHUMUZA (spoken)

My wife and daughter are scared. They ask me what is happening and I do not know



ALL except GARTH and MUHUMUZA

Darkness and trees



GARTH (spoken)

Behind me, this big man comes up to me and he says in this low voice



MUHUMUZA (spoken)

Wewe watuchukuwa wapi?



GARTH (spoken)

What's that, now?
