YOU GET ON THE HORN

(on the phone)

Hello? This is Beulah Davis down at the

Academy. I heard we might be getting some

guests and I thought I?d see if I could help

whosever in charge of getting the school

organized— How many passengers can we take?

Uh — well, we fit about 400 students — yes,

we could probably do 600. Yeah, or sure, 700, if

we really pack them in. When are they coming?

Could be any time now? Well, I?m glad I phoned!

OZ

I get a call from Beulah looking for ?anything

700 people from around the world might

need.? So I go down to Shoppers and the

manager says to just take what I want off the

shelves - toothbrushes, floss, mouthwash,

deodorant. And I?m back at the school, when

Beulah says...

BEULAH

You know, those planes probably got some

babies on them?

A slight pause.

OZ

So I?m back to Shoppers for diapers. And we?re

unpacking them, when Annette says...

ANNETTE

You know, those babies are probably gonna be

hungry...

A slight pause.

OZ

So I?m back to Shoppers for formula and baby

food. And when I get back, Beulah says...

BEULAH

You know, those planes are probably filled with

women of child bearing age?

OZ

Soooo??

BEULAH

So I?M back to Shoppers to pick up as many

pads and tampons as they have.

JANICE

The Baptist Church needs a hand moving their

pews... Doctor O?Brien down at the pharmacy

is ready to fill any prescriptions. Oh, and the

Lion?s Club is looking for some toilet paper, if

you have any extra.
