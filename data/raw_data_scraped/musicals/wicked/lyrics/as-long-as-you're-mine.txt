As Long as You're Mine


ELPHABA

Kiss me too fiercely

Hold me too tight

I need help believing

You're with me tonight

My wildest dreamings

Could not foresee

Lying beside you

With you wanting me



And just for this moment

As long as you're mine

I've lost all resistance

And crossed some borderline

And if it turns out

It's over too fast

I'll make every last moment last

As long as you're mine



FIYERO

Maybe I'm brainless

Maybe I'm wise

But you've got me seeing

Though different eyes

Somehow I've fallen

Under your spell

And somehow I'm feeling

It's up that I fell



BOTH

Every moment

As long as you're mine

I'll wake up my body

And make up for lost time



FIYERO

Say there's no future

For us as a pair



BOTH

And though I may know

I don't care

Just for this moment

As long as you're mine

Come be how you want to

And see how bright we shine

Borrow the moonlight

Until it is through

And know I'll be here holding you

As long as you're mine



FIYERO

(spoken)

What is it?



ELPHABA

(spoken)

It's just for the first time,

I feel ... wicked
