The Wicked Witch of the East


NESSAROSE (spoken)

Elphaba, shut up! First of all, I can't harbor a fugitive, I am an unelected offical. And why should I help you? You fly

around Oz trying to rescure animals you've never even met and not once have you ever thought to use your powers to rescue me!



All of my life, I've depended on you

(sung) How do you think that feels?

All of my life, I've depended on you

And this hideous chair with wheels.

Scrounging for scraps of pity to pick up

And longing to kick up my heels.



ELPHABA (spoken)

Nessa, there isn't a spell for everything. The power is mysterious, it not like cobbiling up a pair of- wait. (beings

chanting from the Grimmerie)



Oh Nessa, at last.

(sung)I've done what long ago I should

And finally from these powers something good

Finally, something good



NESSAROSE (spoken)

Boq! Boq, come quickly!



BOQ (spoken)

You did this for her?



NESSAROSE (spoken)

For both of us!



BOQ (spoken)

Oh Nessa... this changes everything.



NESSAROSE (spoken)

I know.



BOQ:

(spoken)Nessa



NESSAROSE

(spoken)Yes?



BOQ:

(sung)Oh, Nessa

Surely now I'll matter less to you

You won't mind my leaving her tonight.



NESSAROSE

(spoken)Leaving?



BOQ

(sung)Yes,

That ball thats being staged,

Announcing Glinda is engaged

To Fiyero



NESSAROSE

(spoken)Glinda?



BOQ

(sung)Yes Nessa, that's right

I've got to go appeal to her

Express the way I feel for her

(spoken) Nessa, I lost my heart to Glinda from the moment I first saw her. You know that.



NESSAROSE

(spoken)Lost your heart?

(sung)Well we'll see about that.



ELPHABA (spoken)

Nessa, let him go.



NESSAROSE

(sung)Did you think I'd let you leave me here flat?!



BOQ (spoken)

Don't come any closer!



NESSAROSE

(sung)You're going to lose your heart to me, I tell you!

If I have, I have to... magic spell you. (beings chanting from the Grimmerie)



(spoken) This is all your fault! If you had not shown me that horrenible book-



ELPHABA (spoken)

I've got to find another spell. It's the only thing that might work.



NESSAROSE:

(sung)Save him please, just save him.

My poor Boq, my sweet, my brave him.

Do not leave me till my sorry life has ceased.



ELHAPHA

(begins chanting in melody)



NESSAROSE

(sung)Alone and loveless here,

Just the girl in the mirror

Just her and me, Wicked Witch of the East!

We deserve each other.
