The Light in the Piazza


I don't see a miracle shining from the sky

I'm no good at statues and stories

I try



That's not what I think about

That's not what I see

I know what the sunlight can be



The Light, the Light in the Piazza



Tiny sweet

And then it grows

And then it fills the air

Who knows what you call it?

I don't care

Out of somewhere I have something I have never had

And sad is happy

That's all I see



The Light in the Piazza

The Light in the Piazza



It's rushing up

It's pouring out

It's flying through the air

All through the air

Who knows what you call it?

But it's there

It is there



All I see is

All I want is tearing from inside

I see it

Now I see it everywhere

It's everywhere

It's everything and everywhere
