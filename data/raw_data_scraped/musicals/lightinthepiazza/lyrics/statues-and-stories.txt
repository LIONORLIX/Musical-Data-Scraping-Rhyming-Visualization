Statues and Stories


[Margaret]

What happened here? Well let’s see.



On a central square, in a city of the sun rose a palace.

It was high and handsome gleaming like the crown of a king.



[Clara]

Where would that be? Where is that?



[Margaret]

In the tower, a warning bell would ring.



[Clara]

What kind of warning?



[Margaret]

For a fire, or a river overflowing.



[Clara]

Oh.



[Margaret]

Firenze

On a central square, the beginning of a kingdom republic.



[Clara]

Is there a king; is there a queen?



[Margaret]

There were princes, painters, noblemen of logic and art.

[Margaret]

Michaelangelo, the start.



[Clara]

That’s a completely naked statue.



[Margaret]

‘Twas a dawning day unfurling…



[Clara]

From the heart,

The painting of the world we know.



[Clara/Margaret]

The world we know.

On a central square…



[Margaret]

In a city made of statues and stories.



[Clara]

Go on and tell me what they mean.



[Margaret]

It ignited there like a beacon coming out of the dark.

You can feel it…



[Clara]

You can feel it…



[Margaret]

You can follow…



[Clara]

You can follow…



[Margaret]

The spark.



[Clara]

We’re on vacation.



[Margaret]

From an age to an age

It’s a new old world to me.

It’s a new old world and we are here.
