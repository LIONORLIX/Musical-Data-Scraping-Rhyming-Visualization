Say It Somehow


[Clara]

Why don't you trace it on my hand

Or make a song

Do anything



Say it somehow

I will understand

I know you



You are good



[Fabrizio]

There's something inside you

This I know

It's like a melody

Like there you go just now



Say it somehow

Somehow you can show me



[Both]

Say it somehow

Anyway you can

You know me

You are good

Oh, you are good

You are good to me



I know this sound

Oh, touch me (? Of..?)

I think I hear

The sound of love

Your arms around me



Ah



Shout and dance

With means (?)



[Clara]

Or say it silently



[Fabrizio]

Tell me things



[Both]

Oh



We'll play a game (again?)

You'll trace it on my skin

Do it anyway

But let's begin

Do it somehow

Somehow you can show me

I know that you know me



Ah



[Clara]

(speaking)

Will you marry me?



[Fabrizio]

(speaking)

No, no, no

No, no, no, no

It must be mine to ask it



[Clara]

(speaking)

Ask it then!



[Fabrizio]

I wish to be the one to decide!



[Clara]

(speaking)

Decide, decide!



[Fabrizio]

(speaking)

Will you--



[Clara]

(speaking)

Yes!



[Fabrizio]

(speaking)

Will you marry me?



[Clara]

(speaking)

Yes! Yes!



[Both]

You are good to me

I know this sound

Oh, touch me (? Of..?)



I think I hear the sound of love

Your arms around me



Ah



Tell me things



Ohh

Ah
