The Beauty Is


These are very popular, in Italy.

It’s the land of naked marble boys.

Something we don’t see a lot in Winston-Salem,

That’s the land of corduroys.



I’m just a someone in an old museum.

Far away from home as someone can go.

And the beauty is I still meet people I know.

Hello.



This is wanting something, this is reaching for it,

This is wishing that a moment would arrive.

This is taking chances, this is almost touching, what the beauty is.

I don’t understand a word they’re saying,

I’m as different here as different can be.

But the beauty is I still meet people like me.



Everyone’s a mother here, in Italy.

Everyone’s a father, or a son.

I think if I had a child, I would take such care of her.

Then I wouldn’t feel like one.



I’ve hardly met a single soul, but I am not alone.

I feel grown.

This is wanting something, this praying for it,

This is holding breath and keeping fingers crossed.

This is counting blessings, this is wondering when I’ll see that boy again.

I’ve got a feeling he’s just a someone, too.

And the beauty is, when you realize, when you realize,

Someone could be looking for a someone like you.
