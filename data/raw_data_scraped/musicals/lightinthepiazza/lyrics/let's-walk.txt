Let's Walk


[Signor]



I look at him and that was me

The blindness and the energy

I want to say

Here, come this way



[Margaret]



When we are at a certain age

We almost fall on purpose

Fall with all our might

And then it is alright

But what do I know

Of the road to be taken for happiness



[Signor]



Let's walk



[Margaret]



Let's walk



[Signor]



Let's walk



[Margaret]



Let's walk



[Signor]



Let's walk



[Margaret]



Let's see



[Both]



The rest will be

Ah...

And after that

We might as well walk



[Margaret]



When I was younger I was she

The innocence the fantasy

But it's okay

That goes away



[Signor]



That's how I was the way they are

The way they love to worry so

All through the night

When everything's alright



[Both]



But what can we say

The are made of tomorrow and yesterday



Let's walk

Let's walk

It's true

Let's see

Let's walk beyond our vanity



No one knows

We only guess

Just a leap for happiness

For happiness

Happiness



[Signor]



You never know

We might as well walk



[Margaret]



We might as well walk

We might as well



[Both]



Walk
