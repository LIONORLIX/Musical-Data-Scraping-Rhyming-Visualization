The Beauty Is (Reprise)


MARGARET (spoken)

When Clara was twelve, we rented a Shetland

party for her birthday. She and her friends were

leading the pony around, and I turned to get

the phone, and when I turned back, the pony

kicked her.



(sung)

Here

She fell

It seemed to take forever for her to fall

You know in those moments

When momentuous things happen

So slowly

I reach

Like these paintings in the old tradition

There's a figure reaching out in them like so

And to me it is the most familiar tableau

I know



So much wanting something

So much reaching for it

So much wishing just to have one moment back

So much being patient

So much blind acceptance

I know

No, I don't know



A mother here in Italy

A mother here alone

I thought if I had a child

I would take such care of her

So much reaching for it

So much holding breath and keeping fingers crossed

Watching over my

My little lost

Clara



If I could

Then I would paint it over

I would be there and I wouldn't turn away

If I only had a chance to not turn away



And the beauty is

And the beauty is

The beauty is
