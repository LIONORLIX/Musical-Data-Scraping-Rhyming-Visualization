The Joy You Feel


Franca:

Very handsome, your new fellow.

You and I are very much alike, I think. You and Fabrizio



Clara:

Like you and Giuseppe



Franca:

You see, two pairs of lovers



How truly happy you must be

You are the first to set him on his knee

You're the envy of so many girls

And you are the most beautiful

So far



The gentle jangle of his voice

No other sound

No smile

No face

No choice

And the joy I know you feel

This is something I remember well, my dear

And on your first anniversary

In the piazza where you met

At first it's, it's only a glance

And then his eyes will set

Upon a girl who's prettier and younger than you

What to do?



Enjoy it

You are free

You have time to spare

The bassinette is empty

The nursery is bare

You can spend his money

Then there is no money.

You can take a lover. But

He's the one you love

He's the one you love

Isn't he?



Though truly happy, you must beware

For happiness can also scar

For so like me you are

You are

Beware



Clara:

Thank you
