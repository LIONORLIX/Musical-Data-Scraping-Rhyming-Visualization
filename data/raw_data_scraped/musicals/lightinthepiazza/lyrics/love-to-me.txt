Love to Me


[Fabrizio]

The day we meet,

The way you lean against the wind,

And do not know that you are beautiful,

Or that anyone is watching you,

This is what I see.



And I notice how you hunger for surprise,

And do not think that you are tall enough,

Like you’re standing on a mountainside alone,

This is what I see.



Ohhh…

You’re not alone.



Now I see as I have never seen before.

Since that moment in the square,

When you’re hat is carried in the air,

Just so you can chase it,

Just so I can be there,

This is how I know,

This is what I see,

This is love to me.
