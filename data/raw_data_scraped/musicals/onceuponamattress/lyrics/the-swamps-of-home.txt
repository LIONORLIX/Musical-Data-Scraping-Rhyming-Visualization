The Swamps of Home


Winnifred: I come from the land of the foggy, foggy dew ooh-ooh-ooh!

Ooh-ooh-ooh! Ooh-ooh-ooh!

Where walking through the meadow in the morning is like walking through glue!

The swamps of home are brushed with green and gold at break of day.



Dauntless: At break of day.

Winnifred: The swaps of home are lovely to behold from far away.

Dauntless: From far away.

Winnifred: In my soul is the beauty of the bog, in my memory the magic of the mud.

I know that blood is thicker than water but the swamps of home are thicker than blood.

Dauntless: Blo-o-od!

Winnifred: Where e'er I roam my heart grows dank and cold,

my face grows gray when shadows fall and I hear the call?

of the swamps of home.

Ladies: Ah?

Winnifred: I hear them calling me now, calling me back, calling me Winnifred,

Winnifred, Winnifred, Winnifred, who do you think you are?

Girl of the swamp,

Ladies: Winnifred, Winnifred

Winnifred: You've gone to far!

Maid of the marshland, give up the struggle!

Listen to the voice of the swamp;

gluggle-uggle-uggle.

Ladies: gluggle-uggle-uggle.

Winnifred: Where e'er I roam. The whips of fate may smart, but deep down in my heart

Ladies: ooh?

Winnifred: One thought will abide and will ne'er be forgotten,

though I search far and wide there is no land as rotten?

Ladies: Rotten, rotten, rotten, Rotten, rotten, rotten, Rotten, rotten, rotten?

Winnifred: As the swamps of home.

Winnifred, Dauntless & Ladies: The swamps of home!



(Lady Larken enters and, mistaking Winnifred for a maid, sets her off to work-only

to be astonished when Sir Harry comes in and addresses Winnifred as "Your Highness."

Harry and Larken argue and, humiliated, Larken decides she has no choice but to leave

the kingdom)



Larken: I must go.

Jester: Lady Larken, you know that the Queen would never permit

one of her Ladies-in-Waiting to leave the Castle by herself.

Larken: God knows, I'm a Lady-in-Waiting!
