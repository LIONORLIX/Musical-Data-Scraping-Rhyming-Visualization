Sensitivity


Queen:

No, that's not hard enough.

Sensitivity, sensitivity,

I'm just loaded with that!

In this one word is the epitome of the aristocrat!

Sensitive soul and sensitive stomach, sensitive hands and feet;

this is the blessing, also the curse, of being the true elite.

Common people don't know what exquisite agony is suffered by gentle people like me

(Merton is fussing with her hair)

Just get your hands off me!

Think up a tricky test for that wretched, moat-swimming princess?

Merton:

Madam, may I suggest? Maybe we ought to?

Queen:

Don't take all night! I'm not well?

I need my rest.

Not that I ever sleep on that lumpy mattress!

Oh God! My back!

Sensitivity, bane of royalty, that bed's a torture rack!

Oh, I hate to sound grumpy, but my nerves are so jumpy

I am sure I could feel any lump even if it were under the mattress and small as a pea!

That's the answer! Under the mattress! We'll test her tonight!

One tiny pea beneath one thick downy mattress.

Oh God! You're bright!

Any genuine princess would feel it, if she doesn't she's through!

Get the tiniest pea and order one mattress?

No, make it two!

Merton:

Why not five?

Queen:

Ten, I think should be plenty, better still make it twenty.

And to play it safe in the event even that's not enough to insure that she sleeps,

we'll give her a strong sedative, won't we?

You can whip up a drink: Something stunning!

Oh, but you're devilish! I love the way you think!

She's insensitive, so insensitive, she'll fall asleep no doubt.

God but you're clever!

Brilliant! A genius!

You are divine! Get out!



(Winnifred is given a room in the palace and prepares for her test,

whatever it may be. Dauntless, intrigued, wants to know more about her)
