Peace In The Valley


Verse 1:

I am tired and weary, but I must toil on

Till the Lord comes to call me away,

Where the morning is bright and the Lamb is the light,

And the night is as fair as the day.



Chorus:

There'll be peace in the valley for me someway,

There'll be peace in the valley for me.

I pray no more sorrow and sadness or trouble will be,

There'll be peace in the valley for me.



Verse 2:

There the flow'rs will be blooming,

the grass will be green,

And the skies will be clear and serene,

The sun ever shines, giving one endless beam

And no clouds there will ever be seen.



Chorus



Verse 3:

There the bear will be gentle, the wolf will be tame,

And the lion will lay down by the lamb,

The host from the wild will be lead by a Child,

I'll be changed from the creature I am.



Chorus



Verse 4:

No headaches or heartaches or misunderstands,

No confusion or troubles won't be

No frowns to defile, just a big endless smile

There'll be peace and contentment for me.



Chorus
