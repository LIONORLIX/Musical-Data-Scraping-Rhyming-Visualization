See You Later, Alligator


Well, I saw my baby walkin' with another guy today

Well, I saw my baby walkin' with another guy today

When I asked her what's the matter,

This is what I heard her say



[Chorus:]

See you later alligator, after 'while crocodile

See you later alligator, after 'while crocodile

Can't you see you're in my way now,

Don't you know you cramp my style



When I though of what she told me, nearly made me lose my head

When I though of what she told me, nearly made me lose my head

But the next time that I saw her,

Reminded her of what she said



[Chorus]



She said I'm sorry pretty baby, you know my love is just for you

She said I'm sorry pretty baby, you know my love is just for you

Won't you say that you'll forgive me,

And say your love for me is true



[Chorus]



I said wait a minute 'gator, I know you meant it just for play

I said wait a minute 'gator, I know you meant it just for play

Don't you know you really hurt me

And this is what I have to say



[Chorus]
