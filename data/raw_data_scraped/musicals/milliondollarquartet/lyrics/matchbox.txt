Matchbox


Well I'm sitting here wondering, will a matchbox hold my clothes

Yeah I'm sitting here wondering, will a matchbox hold my clothes

I ain't got no matches, but I got a long way to go

I'm an ol' poor boy and a long way from home

I'm an ol' poor boy and a long way from home

Guess I'll never be happy, eveything I do is wrong, yeah



Well let me be your little dog, 'till your big dog comes

Let me be your little dog, 'till your big dog comes

When the big dog gets here, tell him what this little puppy done

Yeah I'm sitting here wondering, will a matchbox hold my clothes

Yeah I'm sitting here wondering, will a matchbox hold my clothes

I got no matches, got a long way to go

Let 'er go boy, go-go
