Brown Eyed Handsome Man


Arrested on charges of unemployment

He was sittin in the witness stand

The judge's wife called up the district attoney

To say "free that brown eyed man"

If you want your job you'd better free that brown eyed man.



Flyn' across the desert in the TWA

I saw a woman walking across the sand

She been walkin 30 miles en route to Bombay

To meet a Brown eyed handsome man

Her destination was a Brown eyed handsome man.



Way back in history 3000 years

Back ever since the world begin

There's been a whole lotta good women she'd a tear

For a brown eyed handsome man

A lot of trouble for a brown eyed handsome man.



Beautiful daughter couldn't make up her mind

'tween a doctor and a lawyer man

The mother told the daughter "go out and find

Yourself a brown eyed handsome man"

That's what your daddy was: a brown eyed handsome man.



Milo Venus was a beautiful lass

She had the world at the palm of her hand

But she lost both the arms in a wrestiling macht

To get a brown eyed handsome man

She fought and won herself a brown eyed handsome man.



Two, three, the count with nobody on

He hit a high fly into the stand

Round the third he was headed for home

He was a brown eyed handsome man.

That won the game he was a brown eyed handsome man
