Stoned


He measured time passing in hits from the bong.

All day cafe hangs and unfinished songs.

Then her keys weighed more then the ax in his hand

When he tried to write a song he knew she wouldn't understand.



She's living in a phony paradise,

So many things she doesn't realize,

She's basking in hell's sunshine...

How does this song go?



He's trying to write a song, but the song is writing him-

It's a song about paradise, wearing thin.



Today paradise was the enemy

Today the real became routine

Today my edges dull together

Yeah, that's it!

And there's no point left to dream.

I want to scream!

Mariana, rocking hash, you've got me stoned

And I can't find my way home.



She's serving every one of my desires on a platter, but it doesn't even matter anymore!

Oh, paradise is a bore.

It doesn't even matter anymore.



You gonna ask me how I'm doing or don't you care?

I'm bored out of my mind, and what do you do over there?

Having a big old house should make a woman sing,

La la la la la la la la

But then, you've got to live in it, and that's a whole 'nother thing



It was a beautiful group



I'm not getting any younger,

You better think about that.



Now I can't even move!



The problem ain't where you're from,



It's where I'm at.



I could buy you a ticket.



It's where I'm at?



Just like that.



Mariana rocking hash, you've got me stoned!

Welcome to Amsterdam

And I can't find my way home!

Welcome to Amsterdam



She's serving every one of my desires on a platter, but it doesn't even matter anymore!

Paradise is a bore,

It doesn't even matter anymore!



Oh, Paradise is a bore

It doesn't even matter anymore

Paradise is a bore

It doesn't even matter anymore



Why you want to leave?



Paradise is a bore



Right when it was starting to feel real...



((Continues similarly to end))
