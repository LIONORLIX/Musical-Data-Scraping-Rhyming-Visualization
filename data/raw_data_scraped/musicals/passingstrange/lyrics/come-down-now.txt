Come Down Now


Listening is waiting...

Listening is waiting...



Now you are knee-deep in your head's footnotes and your eyes are closing.

I'll take your complex out of context, and you can stop your posing.



I've been listening to you talking in your sleep.  It's a strange poetry.

You're always running from something, it seems.



Let me chase away whatever's hurting you, just have to ask it of me.

My love is more real than all your dreams.



'Cause I've been thinking about leaving my fingerprints on your being.

I've been thinking about leaving my fingerprints on your being.

I've been thinking about leaving my fingerprints on your being.

It's like church now.



So come down now

Remove your mask.

See, all you gotta do is ask me.  I'll give you all the love life allows.



So come down now.

Remove your mask.

See, all you gotta do is ask me.  I'll give you all the love life allows.



All you gotta do is ask me.

All you gotta do is ask me.

All you gotta do is ask me.

All you gotta do is ask me.

All you gotta do is ask me.



What does this feeling mean to you, both to be seen and to be seen-through?

What does this feeling mean to you, both to be seen and to be seen-through?

See, love raged like an ocean in a state of withdrawal.  A fishbowl of emotion and the Berlin Wall.

Love raged like an ocean in a state of withdrawal.



Right when it was starting to feel real.



How you gonna deal?

Right when it was starting to feel real.

How you gonna deal?

Right when it was starting to feel real.

How you gonna deal?

Right when it was starting to feel real.

Why you want to leave?
