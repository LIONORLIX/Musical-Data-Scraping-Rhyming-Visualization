Must Have Been High


See, Terry?s folks, they went out of town

So they bought a sheet, and they all got down

Chandelier eyes and electric chairs

Visit your mind and spend two days there



Where every song sounds just like an angel?s choir

The edges get rounded, you?ll have wings of fire

Soaring through the sky, they must have been high

They must have been high



Sitting on the balcony watching the rail rust

Time slips through their fingers



Didn?t she vow to live in a tree

While staring at static on the T.V.?

And when she said ?I am a bird? (I am a bird)

He hung on tight and drank every word



And everything matters, it?s so different now

The ashes were scattered, they moved on somehow

Never asking why, they must have been high

They must have been high



Sitting on the balcony watching the rail rust

Time slips through your fingers like angel dust



Slips through your fingers just like angel dust?
