There's a Riot Goin' Down


Mayday, mayday there's a riot goin' down

In a deep dark corner of West Berlin town



Mayday, mayday there's a riot goin' down

In a deep dark corner of West Berlin town



Mayday, mayday there's a riot goin' down

In a deep dark corner of West Berlin town



Mayday, mayday there's a riot goin' down

In a deep dark corner of West Berlin town



Molotov Cocktails are turning up the heat

And the overturned cars are burning in the street

And the people keep on screaming and the

Billy clubs are swinging and the

And the people keep on screaming and the

Billy clubs are swinging



YOUTH:

What the fuck is going on?

What the fuck is going wrong?

Can I get a straight answer?



NARRATOR:

Check the chorus of this song!



ALL:

Mayday, mayday there's a riot goin' down

Mayday, mayday there's a riot goin' down

Mayday, mayday there's a riot goin' down

Mayday, mayday there's a riot goin' down

Mayday, mayday there's a riot goin' down

Mayday, mayday there's a riot goin' down!
