Passing Phase


YOUTH:



You gotta fill the void with music

Fill the void with song

'Til my cup runneth over all night long



I live in vans crammed with guitars

I'll sleep on floors and play in bars

I dance to my own metronome

'Til chaos feels like home



I grow colder,

I grow bolder,

I grow older

And keep fillin' my cup

I grow colder,

I grow bolder,

I grow older,

But I'll never grow up



And this is not a passing phase!



OTHERS:



It was just a passing phase...



YOUTH:



No, this is not a passing phase!



OTHERS:



It was just a passing phase...



YOUTH:



You see, I'll stay on for so long



OTHERS:



It was just a passing phase...



YOUTH:



'Til chaos feels like home...



OTHERS:



It was just a passing phase...



YOUTH:



Up and down from town to town

'Til van wheels go 'round and 'round

Up and down from town to town

'Til van wheels go 'round and 'round



Every night, play rock 'n' roll,

Get fucked up after the show

In the morning, lock and load

And then leave-!



NARRATOR:



-Right when it was starting to feel real!



Wish we could talk about how the means will not prepare you for the ends...

How your epiphanies become fair-weather friends...

How death will make you lower your defenses...

The only truth of youth is the grown-up consequences...



See, song is a bong,

But song cannot heal

You believed in it too long,

Now I need something more than real...

I need something more than real...



Someday the chords of age will drown out the life you've been dreaming of,

Then you'll be out on your ass,

And cursing the last:



Your song is just passing for love

My song was just passing for love

And you will never see her again

And I will never see her again

And we will never see her again...
