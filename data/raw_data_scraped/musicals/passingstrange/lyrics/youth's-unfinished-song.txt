Youth's Unfinished Song


YOUTH:



She left me out of the blue

I now understand that she never knew what was due from me

Why leave me alone?

Her eyes were red but her heart's stone-cold

But she go from me...



I couldn't be her dream

She focused on things that weren't there in me,

Then she split the scene



She wanted me to change

That's not love in my view

Let's inspect the remains:

Oh, she's alone now, too

What's the point of looking for what's not there in you?



You lose track of...

You lose...

[spoken]

How does this song go?

Da da da da da da da da

Da da da da da...
