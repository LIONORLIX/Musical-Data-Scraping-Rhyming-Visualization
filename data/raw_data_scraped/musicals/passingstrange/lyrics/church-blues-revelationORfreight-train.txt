REVEREND JONES:

I'ma tell y'all a story 'bout Apostle Paul



YOUTH:

REVEREND JONES:

I said, I'ma tell y'all a story 'bout Apostle Paul



NARRATOR:

Cruisin' up and down that fretboard

like it was the road to Damascus-



REVEREND JONES:

Where you headed, pilgrim?

If you don't know the way, you better ask us-

REVEREND JONES:

Who came here to feel the spirit?

Who came here to get inspired?

We built this house on love, can you feel it??



NARRATOR:

Now the boy and the Reverend are tradin' licks now...



REVEREND JONES:

Hoo! Yes! Praise Jesus!



NARRATOR:

Hotter than a party on the River Styx, now...



REVEREND JONES:

Come on now! Praise God!



NARRATOR:

Leadin' the church on a Holy Ghost church,

It's a pilgrimage of a solo,



REVEREND JONES:

Well, well, well...



NARRATOR:

It's a Fillmore West Bank solo



REVEREND JONES:

Well, well, well...



NARRATOR:

You're tappin' your foot, but you don't hear me through

Boy's taggin' along,

there's a message in his song,

He was freed, guaranteed, just had to let the pilgrim lead-

Come on, church!!



REVEREND JONES:

Now, is God real?



CHORUS:

Yes, He's real!



REVEREND JONES:

Well, can you deal with the real?

REVEREND JONES:

Now, hit me with the Holy Ghost!!



NARRATOR:

The bubble was expanding, there was a new understanding!!



ALL:

Music is the freight train in which God travels!

Bang! It does it's thang and then my soul unravels!

Heals like holy water, and fights all my battles,

Music is the freight train in which God travels



Music is the freight train in which God travels! (oh Lord!)

Bang! It does it's thang and then my soul unravels! (Oh Lord!)

Heals like holy water, and fights all my battles, (Oh Lord!)

Music is the freight train in which God travels (Oh Lord!)



REVEREND JONES:

Now, is God real?



CHORUS:

Yes, He's real!



REVEREND JONES:

Well, can you deal with the real?



CHORUS:

Now, is God real?



CHORUS:

REVEREND JONES:

Well, can you deal with the real?



CHORUS:

We can-!!
