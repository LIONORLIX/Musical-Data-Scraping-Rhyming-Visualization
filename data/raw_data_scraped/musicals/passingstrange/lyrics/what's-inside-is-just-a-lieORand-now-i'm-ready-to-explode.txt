What's Inside Is Just a Lie/And Now I'm Ready to Explode


Welcome to Mr. Venus' riot cabaret.

What's inside is just a lie (x4)

Ideas are dependable, there's a new one every week.

Emotions are expendable because they aren't unique.

Culture is cosmetic (x4)

What's inside is just a lie (x4)



See, I know this is going to sound a little bit crazy, but according to the Nowhaus manefesto, and I quote, "What's inside of each and every one of us here in this room; what we mistakenly call 'our' thoughts, 'our' feelings, and 'our' dreams have actually been put there by a system. Therefore, . . . "



What's inside is just a lie



". . . our minds have been invaded, conquered, and occupied. Hense, . . ."



What's inside is just a lie



And like a catchy refrain that gets trapped in your head

What's inside is just a lie

And like a catchy refrain that gets trapped in your head

What's inside is just a lie

Somebody else's desires get lodged in your brain.

What's inside is just a lie

So the only way to become your true self

What's inside . . .

Is to create your true self.

What's inside . . .

You turn your life into a work of art (x3)

What's inside is just a lie!



So the real that I've been searching for

Is in the beauty of these burning streets

It's a song I couldn't write yesterday

(What's inside is just a lie)

Till mayday gave me the courage to bleed

(Only love is real, yeah)

I'll write a song called Revolution

(What's inside is just a lie)

'Cause mayday gave me the courage to bleed

(Only love is real, yeah)

And now I'm ready (Yeah!) (x3)

To explode

And now I'm ready (Yeah!) (x3)

To explode

And now I'm ready (Yeah!) (x3)

To explode
