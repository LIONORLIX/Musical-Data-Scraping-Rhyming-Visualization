Identity


I am bleeding sunshine.

I am eptying my veines.

And when I'm done bleeding sunshine

thins song will break my chaines.

Your gaze completes my being.

But I'll make you gaze in vain.

I illumintate with fiction

the truth darkness cannot explain.

America is flowing, slowly exiting my veins

I am giddy, cold, and glowing

And this song will break my chaings.

The chains of I-I-I-I-I-IDENTITY! x3



Why don't you want to be around your own people?



YOUTH:

The key to the real is finally in my hand

and now your expectation are exiting my veins

The key to the real is finally in my hand

And now your expectations are flowing out my veins

His the wall, free at last

Hit the wall, free at last.

I am the 20th century reincarnate

Hit the wall, free at last.

The 20th century coming home

covered in mud

and missing a shoe

Child, what's become of you? Haven't you got any sense? x3



Nein my momma. Nein my momma. Nein my momma.

Nein my momma. Nein my momma Nein momma Nein mommamomma ma ma ma ma!



Mutti, bist du da? Hallo. Mutti, kannst du ein bischen Geld f?r me sendin? Mutti? Halllooo?



Wir haben ein bad connection.

Wir haben ein bad connection.

Wir haben ein bad connection connection connection connection!!



Why don't you want to be around your own people?



YOUTH:

My pain and my ego once stood at opposing ends.

but they met up in Berlin

Now they're the best of friends

And now I am drained of your expectations

I was instructed from the start to let my pain fuck my ego and I called the bastard art.

PAIN. EGO. ART! PAIN. EGO. ART!

I let my



ENSEMBLE:

Pain



YOUTH:

Fuck my



ENSEMBLE:

Ego



YOUTH:

And I



ENSEMBLE:

Called the bastard



YOUTH:

Art! x3
