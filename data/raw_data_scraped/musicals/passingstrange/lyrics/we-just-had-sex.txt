We Just Had Sex


Open up the flood gates

Knock down all your fences.

The realist is around the corner.

Test drive your new senses.

And fetter, and sweater, it's wetter, and it just keeps getting better, and better, and better, and better...



We just had sex,

there's nothing sleazy about a natural reflex.

It's nice and easy no need to crance your necks.

It's all cool breezy baby.

What's a little bedroom traffic?

Evenin news is pornographic!



We just had sex,

That's right all three of us

It's not complex.

It's no bid deal at all

We smoke cigarettes, and probably talk about

10 or 15 things

before anyone brings up de fact that

we just had sex

to keep it fresh sometimes we shuffle the dekcs

We realized that this might fog up your specs

But that's just how it goes!



You may find it quite risque, but it's the European way!



La la la. La lala la la.



Don't get to vexed, It's really no big deal that

we just had sex

And now we're gonnga rol five big cigarettes

and have a cup of coffee!



YOUTH:

I love how they're so nonchalante about the only thing I want.
