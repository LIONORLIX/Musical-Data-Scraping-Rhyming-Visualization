Arlington Hill


He took a trip for the first time in a bug

on Arlington Hill

Hip to hip, shoulder to shoulder

radio blasts in everyone's ears

Oh she sees you there

In the rearview

Choking on smoke and

trying to be cool



And if you should head for the ceiling

Close both your eyes then you'll see everything

'Cause suddenly there is a meaning

And Arlington Hill helped him see everything



Oh Adams and Crenshaw is beautiful and they are

laughing in the sun

Then they parachute into church so they can

sing before practice is done

when they raise one voice

stoned angels weep

then he feels the holy ghost

creeping up  slowly



And suddenly there is a meaning

Arlington Hill helped him see everything

Yes suddenly there is a meaning

and everything's alright

everything's alright

everything's alright

everything's alright...
