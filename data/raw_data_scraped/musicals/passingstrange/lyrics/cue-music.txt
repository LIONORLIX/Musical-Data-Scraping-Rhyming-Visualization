MOM:



Don't be sad about your chosen path

And where it's taken you thus far

'Cause this is what you did

And that is who you are



And it's all right...



NARRATOR:



Is it all right?



MOM:



Yes, it's all right...



NARRATOR:



Is it all right?



MOM:



Yes, it's all right...



NARRATOR:



Is it all right?
