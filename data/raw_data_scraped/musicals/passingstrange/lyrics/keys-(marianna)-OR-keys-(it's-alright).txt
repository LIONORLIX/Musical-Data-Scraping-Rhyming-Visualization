Keys (Marianna)



MARIANNA:

Hey, Mr. L.A, I know a place that you can stay

Right next door to here is a nice flat, yeah, it's OK

The room-mates gone to Spain,

The place is sloppy, it's insane

But, the sun shines through big windows, only Dracula would complain

No one's ever there, you'll have your peace,

There's a view and a bottle of gin

She's back in, oh, two or three weeks

The room would be all yours 'til then

So here's the keys...



YOUTH:

You mean-



MARIANNA:

My keys.

Here is my address, you see, it's really quite a mess

But take them, please:

My keys

I've got an extra set back at the place,

So take mine now,

That's just in case you'll need

My keys

My keys



NARRATOR:

She had a crazy mixed up flat

(He wasn't thinking about that)

You know the bed was kinda hard, a prison cot-cum-yoga mat

Ten thousand paintings everywhere,

She was kind of an acrobat,

Oh, you were lucky to find a chair,

The sweetest dump in which he'd sat

She had nude photos everywhere,

from freaky-deaky to plain arty

Some of her girlfriends showered there

As you can see, Amsterdam's a party!



YOUTH:

I appreciate this more than you could ever know

I promise I won't break a thing



MARIANNA:

Don't promise, you never know...

My place ain't all that wonderful,

But I hope you find it comfortable,

So please, take my keys.

The faucets leak, the cupboard's bare,

My -ha- underwear are everywhere!

But please, take my keys

Take my keys



YOUTH:

And after so long, feelin' so alone,

I feel like pickin' up the phone

And callin' up that place called home

To say I have a brand new family

Where I can be that thing called "Me".

No more sayin' "Uncle" to Uncle Sam,

I'm tellin' L.A just where I am...

Color me Amsterdam

Amsterdam...



Keys (It's Alright)



Narrator: So after a little conversation,

He's got keys to her flat

After a little conversation he just walks across her welcome mat

Now who'd of thought

Trust could be bought

For a song and a little chat?

See he had friends and family

Nowhere near as cool as that

She gave him these

Her keys



Now in Beverly Hills they gave him chills

And South Central put his sould in the deep freeze

She gave him her keys.



You know those LA ladies in their mercedes

would lock their door if he'd just sneeze

Now he's like, "bitch please"

She gave me her keys.



He said, the kind of place I wanna be is where

No one's cold or scared of me

And then she handed him these

Her keys



Yeah, I guess no one ever made him feel

As real as when she mended him by lending him

Her keys



And said welcome to Amsterdam

Welcome to Amsterdam

Welcome to Amsterdam

She said yeah it might look like Sodom

from top to bottom

A shopping mall or vice

But it's alright with me

(Yeah it's alright)

'Cuz she said it's alright

(Yeah it's alright)

She said yeah it might

Look like Sodom

From top to bottom

A shopping mall of vice

But it's alright with me

(Yeah it's alright)

Cuz we say it's alright

(Yeah it's alright)

Cuz we say it's alright

(Yeah it's alright)...
