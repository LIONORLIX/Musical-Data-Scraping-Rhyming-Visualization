Mom Song


Narrator: It's breaking her heart

This questioning of everything

Unannounced, he's flown

Out from under your wing



Mother: I'm hardly afraid

Of your new world's strange design

Why don't you make room for me

As I made room for you in mine?



See i've been running from this world

For far longer than you

But I didn't know where else to go

So I hid from it in you



And for a time the world was yours and mine

And that was only yesterday, you see

Now you've got your own life

And it does not include me



Narrator: It's breaking her heart

She says you seem so distant these days



Mother: Unannounced, you've grown

Into a living thing

Into a living thing

Into a living thing

Into a living thing



Narrator (overlapping with above):

Into a living thing

Into a living thing

Into a living thing

Into a living thing



Chorus: This is your life and it's the only one you've got!

This is your life: There ain't no way out!
