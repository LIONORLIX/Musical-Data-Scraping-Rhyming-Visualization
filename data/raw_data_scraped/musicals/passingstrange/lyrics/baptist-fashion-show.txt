Baptist Fashion Show


BAND

Da Da Da Da, Da Da Da Da



MOTHER

These catty church bitches give

me the blues,

And Lord, look at these

shoes...



NARRATOR

And you know...

Church people were all about

the shoes.



BAND

Mama says you gotta go

To the Baptist Fashion Show...



NARRATOR

Silk ties, shiny purses, fancy

hats, and jewels.



BAND

Mama says you gotta go...

Jesus gonna save your soul.



NARRATOR

And that Christian catwalk was

real unforgiving...



BAND

Mama says you gotta go,

But she didn't wanna go...



NARRATOR

...to anyone who couldn't fit in

for a living.



BAND

Mama says you gotta go...

To the Baptist Fashion Show...



NARRATOR

Holy war on Sunday morning...

It was war on Sunday

morning...



Now the church on Adams

Boulevard is usually a bore.

The ladies wave fans and the

old men snore.

The kids cut up on cue in the

very back pew,

And the Holy Ghost ain't been

here since 1972.



They got real estate, college

funds, jobs with benefits,

Home-owners, debutantes...



YOUTH

This place is as phony as it

gets.



NARRATOR

LOOK!

Everybody sharp,

Ain't not one head nappy.

But it's been a long time since

the church got happy.

And with their judgmental eyes,

See, they've all just realized...



PHILISTINES

Fourteen years old and still

ain't been baptized...



NARRATOR

Now just as he thought, "This'll

be a nightmare come true,"

His conviction turned to ice in

that chilly church pew,

His convication turned to ice in

that chilly church pew.



YOUTH

Jesus'll make it back here

before I do.



NARRATOR

He saw the brownskin-ded

ladies in their oversized crowns,

And the jet-black deacons with

them "Don't you do that"

frowns,

And the high yellow girls in

their skin-tight gowns,

A collection of verbs disguised

as nouns.



And ev'ry Sunday she pushed

him,

But she never wanted to go.

Ev'ry Sunday he listened,

But he didn't want to know.



It's too bad they never talked

about,

The shared truth that dwelled

below:

Who could handle the pressure

of this Baptist Fashion Show?
