PARADICE

Let me offer up this.

Me and Brooklyn on one stage like heavy weights in the ring.

So, what do you say My cherie?

Time to put on the gloves.



BROOKLYN

Excuse me?



PARADICE

Did I stutter?

Time to put on the gloves

You and me singing like a couple of mothes,

And America chooses one or the other

But here's the catch, my little french fry,

Winner take all.

I'm talking the biggest stage on earth,

madison square garden

It'll be a war of style,

War of words,

War of song.

I'm talking the war that'll rock the world.



BROOKLYN

Look, I just came here to find my father

And I have no intention fo getting into a war with anyone.
