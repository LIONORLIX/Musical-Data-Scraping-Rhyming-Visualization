Madison Square Garden


M.C.

Ladies and gentlemen!

Madison Square garden welcomes you to the might we've all been waiting for.

By calling in and casting your votes, you decide the destiny of these two divas.

Hanging in the balance, the biggest purse in the history of all histories.

Storming into the ring tonight, a native of the United Streets of America,

and she's about to show us that grace is sometimes a breathtaking display of lightning.

It's a majestic eruption of a volcano.

Yes, grace is sometimes even a raging fire.

Brothers and sisters, I give you the prophet of paradise, Mzzz Paradiiiiiiiiiice!
