Good Crowd Goin'


Streetsinger:

Yeah!

Looks like we got a good crowd goin' here tonight on Streetsinger's Row.

Streetsinger's Row, that's where we do our little sidewalk show,

and we gonna be doin our little show for you all in just about a minute or so.

And look....looks like every star out in heaven is shinin' down on Brooklyn tonight.

So reach into those pockets and pocketbooks,

Because we ain't doin' this for our health you know.



Urchin:

Uh... Yes we are



Sreetsinger:

Ain't that the truth!
