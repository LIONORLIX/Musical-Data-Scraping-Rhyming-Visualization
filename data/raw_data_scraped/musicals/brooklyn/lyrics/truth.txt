Truth


Taylor:

From the time we're very young,

We're told the truth is something precious

Something noble, something regal

It will lift us like the wind

And give us wings like the eagle



All:

But that's the furthest thing from the truth



Taylor:

From the time we're very young

We're taught the truth is like a beacon

Something holy, like a spirit

It will free is from our fears

The closer we get near it



All:

But that's the furthest thing from the truth



Brooklyn:

Did your heart belong to someone

Other than my mother?

Don't I have a right to know

Have I a sister or a brother



All:

Don?t I have a right to know?

Don't I have a right to know?



Brooklyn:

Huh?!?!?



Taylor:

Oh, the truth is but a flame

That engulfs the butterfly

It destroys all things of beauty

Keep your illusions and your lies



All:

Walk out that door



From the time we're very young

From the time we're very young

From the time we're very, very,

Very, very, very, very, very,

Very, Very, very, young?



Brooklyn:

>From the time that I was young

I thought the truth was like a mirror

I wanna face it, I wanna feel it

I wanna find out who I am

But like a coward you conceal it



All:

But that?s the furthest thing from the truth



Taylor(spoken):

Look, I don?t know you; you don't know me. You know nothing of me!



Brooklyn(spoken):

Well, I know this?



(sung)You left a woman and a child

Have you no sense of shame?

Were you so young and selfish

It's my mother that you blamed

What courage does it take

To look me in the eye?

You can't bury truth in silence

Like a tree it's gonna rise



All:

Like a tree it's gonna rise

Like a tree it's gonna rise

Like a tree it's gonna rise

Like a tree it's gonna rise



Taylor:

The truth is but a wind

That robs the autumn from the trees

It leaves things empty like this needle

No, the truth won't set you free



All:

So walk out that door



From the time we're very young

From the time we're very young

From the time we're very, very,

Very, very, very, very, very,

Very, Very, very, young?



Brooklyn and Taylor:

From the time we're very young



All:

We're taught the truth is all that matters



Brooklyn:

It gives you strength

It makes you wise



Taylor:

But in truth it only shatters

So don't look into my eyes

Don't you look into my eyes
