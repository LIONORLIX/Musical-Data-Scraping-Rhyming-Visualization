I Never Knew His Name


Brooklyn:

Taylor Collins. I never knew his name,

But I imagined what he looked like, imagined how he'd smile.

A hug tight, a kiss goodnight, the way a father holds his child.



I never knew his name.

But I imagined him a hero, a bright and shining knight.

And daddy's eyes would stop my cries and make everything alright.



Oh, daddy's eyes would stop my cries, and make everything alright.

I never knew, I never knew his name.
