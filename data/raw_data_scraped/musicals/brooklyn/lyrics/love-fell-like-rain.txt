Love Fell Like Rain


M.C.

She came to America looking for the lyric to her life.

And so tonight, Madison Square Garden is proud to bring to you the

olng awaited, much anticipated union of father and daguther.

Performing tonight for the very first time on this stage,

the greatest stage on earth,

I give you Paris' amazing grace, Brooklyn.



BROOKLYN

She waited tables

In a small cafe

In paris, 1969



He was a singer

From Brooklyn, USA

I hear it was a special time



Love fell like rain

From the warm Paris sky

The song he sang

As he kissed her goodbye



La, la, la, la

La, la

La, la, la, la...



Ladies and gentlemen,

My father!!



PARADICE

Ooo, do I smell a forfeit?

Isn't this rich, the phantom daddy is M.I.A.

Well, I got a towel... wannna throw it in?
