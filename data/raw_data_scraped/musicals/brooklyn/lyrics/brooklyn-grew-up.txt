Brooklyn Grew Up


Company:

Brooklyn grew up!



Faith:

Looking in the mirror never knowing who she really was.

With a hairbrush in her hand like a microphone,

she would sing the song that her mother would sing.



Brooklyn:

La la la la, la la la la



Company:

From the day she was born, Brooklyn sang out this song.



Brooklyn:

My daddy don't know that I was ever born.

This pain in my heart is getting stronger, and I don't think I can take it any longer.



Brooklyn and Company:

This pain in my heart, this ache in my soul,

this yearning in my heart just keeps on going on



Brooklyn:

Cause my daddy don't



Company:

Daddy don't



Brooklyn:

Don't even know



Brooklyn and Company:

No, my daddy don't know that I was ever born.



Brooklyn:

Daddy! Daddy! There's a voice deep inside and it cries and it cries.

Someone is calling me far away, far away.
