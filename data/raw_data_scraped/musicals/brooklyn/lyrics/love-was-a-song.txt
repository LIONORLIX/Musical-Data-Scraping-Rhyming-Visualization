Love Was A Song


TAYLOR:

Love was a song once, tender and warm, like the breath of a cool summer morning.

And life was a dance once, graceful and sweet, like a tumbling leaf, a tumbling leaf.



Then fate like the wind swept it away, and left me with nothing to sing or to play.

Is it all by design, or simply by chance?

Love was a song once and life was a dance...Faith?



Love was a song, like mist in the spring.

My fingers were young, and could dance on these strings.

And life was a dance, an endless ballet, suspended in time and then swept away.



Fate, like the wind, wild, untamed, left me with nothing but shame!



(Preacherman...Benjii...Shooter, c'mon)

(What have I done? What have I done? What have I done?)



Is it all by design, or simply by chance?

Love was a song once and life was a dance.

Let our fate write words to this song
