Love Me Where I Live


Paradice:

I was born on mean street baby

Right across from ugly road

You were born on Sweet Lane, baby

Had tem things I've never know



Now I got what you want, baby

And if you want me to give,

Sacrifice your paradise

Love me where I live



(spoken) Trash never looked do good, huh?



(sung)I was raised on hustle baby

You were raised on Sunday school

I was raised on riot, baby

You were raised on golden rule



I can raise you heartbeat, baby

Can you take what I can give?

Sacrifice your paradise

Love me where I live



(spoken) I call this Salvation Armani.



(sung)You can't get me off with diamonds



All:

No, no, no



Paradice:

My jewelry is dice

My body's rich for what you itch

But you gotta pay my price?

Love me where I live



(spoken) You know, I've been hearing some rumblings out there,

sayin' that my time is done, that I should just accept my fate.

Funny thing, it seems whenever me and fate go toe to toe,

it's always fate that does the? no show.



(sung) I'll walk into a lighting storm

With metal in my fist

Daring fate to strike me down

But you know it's gonna miss



I'll curse inside the house of God

Or any church I please

'Cause I don't bow to no one, baby

Nothin gets me on my knees

And you like me for that



All:

I like you for that



Paradice:

I wanna hear you like me for that



All:

I like you for that



Paradice:

Oh, yeah, you like me for that



All:

I like you for that



Paradice:

Love me where I live



You can tie me to a railroad track

And let that diesel run

But you'll never see a drop of sweat

'Cause temping fate is fun



I'll tap dance on a minefield

And never feel a thing

You can throw me in the lion's den

But guess who comes out king

And you like me for that



All:

I like you for that



Paradice:

Oh yeah, you like me for that



All:

I like you for that



Paradice:

I wanna hear that you like me for that





All:

I like you for that



Paradice:

Oh, baby, love me where I live



(spoken) Oo, well hello there, Mr. four-car garage, suburban home,

1 wife, 2.3 kids, 2 dogs, 1 cat, 1 mistress, Armani wearin',

Wall Street Journal bearin',

Cuban smokin' Republican votin' magnanimous and magnificent hunk of a man!



Yeah, I know what you're thinkin':

"That Ms. Paradice is one bad motha?"



All:

(spoken)Shut yo' mouth!



Paradice:

(spoken) And you like me for that.



(sung)Hey, bury me in Red Hook, baby

Right there in my neighborhood

And when you die, I know you wanna

Rest in peace in Hollywood



But you ain't restin' nowhere, baby

'Til you get a piece of this

Sacrifice your paradise

Love me where I?



All:

You got to love me

You got to love me



Paradice:

Sacrifice your paradise

Love me where I live



All:

You got to love me

You got to love me



Paradice:

Sacrifice your paradise

Love me where I live



(spoken (Well, America, I sung for you. I danced for you.

I bared my soul for you. I made you laugh, I made you think, and I made you mad.

You loved me and you loathed me and you made me rice?

and that's the American way? and I play that game well.

Oh, but I got a message for you this evenin';

if you turn your back on me now, if you turn your back on me now, if you turn

your back on me now America, you can all kiss my black ass!
