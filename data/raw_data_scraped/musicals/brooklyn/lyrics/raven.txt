Raven


Paradice:

Goliath was a giant..

Taught and mean

David was a sweetheart

Squeaky Clean

But it still takes two

To tell that story

So i'll play my part

And in all my glory



I'll fly.. like a raven

In a sky of doves

I'll make you love, to hate me

But that's still love

It's still love



Love is what i want

Love is what i need

You see beneath this suit of armor

I still bleed

I still bleed



He used to hold me like a flower

Kiss me, oh, so slow

And we talk about forever

But that was long ago



And now forever's just a place

In someone else's story

And though my heart still breaks

I'm gonna find my glory



And fly like a raven

In a sky of doves

I'll make you love to hate me

But that's altight because it's still love

It's still love



Love is what i want

Love is what is need

You see beneath this suit of armor

I still bleed

So i'll fly just like a raven

In a sky of doves

I'll make you love.. to hate me

But that's all still love

It's still love



Love is what i want!

Love is what i need!

You see beneath this suit of armor,

I still bleed!

Oh, I,

I, Still bleed..
