Changing Lives


(spoken):

It's Olivia Keating of Broadway Mania and we're here for the opening night of Eleanor,

the Eleanor Roosevelt musical, starring the incomparable Dee Dee Allen and Barry Glickman



BARRY (spoken):

Let's talk process



(sung)

When I'm in character

I go insane

I stagger, I stammer, I sob

I make the audiences feel my pain

And if they don't leave depressed

Then I've not done my job



DEE DEE:

Each time I've found a role like Eleanor

The artist inside of me thrives

I put on my wig

And those prosthetic teeth

And know I'm changing lives

By the time I get tuberculosis in Act Two



BARRY:

Even the people who are dead inside



BOTH:

Will Shout

'Bravo!'

On Cue



BARRY (spoken):

The first review is in!

The New Jersey Star-Ledger



DEE DEE (spoken):

No, don't tell me

... What does it say?



BARRY (spoken):

It says we're a hit!



(sung)

We're a hit and I think we deserve it!



DEE DEE:

That's for sure



BARRY:

Also it means that this tour de force

Will not be forced to tour



DEE DEE (spoken):

To Eleanor!

May she run for eternity!



ENSEMBLE:

To Eleanor!



ALL:

Here's to a show that's so inspiring

It's almost too much to sit through

And if we're ? that might mean one more thing



BARRY:

That in ten years or so, we'll do Eleanor 2!



DEE DEE:

I can predict what the reviews will say

Before the next note has arrived

It's ground-breaking



ENSEMBLE:

Earth-Shaking



BARRY:

Life-affirming



ENSEMBLE:

Breath-taking



BARRY & DEE DEE:

Gut-wrenching



ALL:

Heart-aching



BARRY and DEE DEE:

In two words it's



ALL:

History-making



BARRY and DEE DEE:

That's why every actor strives



ALL:

For congratulation

And compensation

That comes from nightly

Changing Lives



BARRY (spoken):

It's just what we do
