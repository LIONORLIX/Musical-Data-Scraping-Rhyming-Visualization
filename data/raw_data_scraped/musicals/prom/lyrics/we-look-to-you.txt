We Look to You


MR. HAWKINS:

My days have little glamour

[?], making calls

And wincing at the grammar

Written on the bathroom walls

It's all school supplies and budget size

And wading through red tape

That's why I love the theater

It's how I escape



DEE DEE (spoken):

So, theater is a distraction? Is that what you're saying?



MR. HAWKINS (spoken):

No, a distraction is momentary. An escape helps you heal



(sung)

We look to you

To take us away

From the soul-crushing jobs

And emasculating pay

When our lives come up short

And our hopes are sad and few

You whisk us off to some place strange and new



We look to you

In good times and bad

The worlds you create

Make the real ones seem less sad

The curtain goes up

And every now and then it feels as if we're coming home again

Yes, coming home again



We need a place to run to

When everything goes wrong

When the answer to each problem

Is to burst into a song

And simple rules of logic just simply don't apply

When people dance in unison

And no one wonders why



DEE DEE (spoken):

You make it sound so beautiful



MR. HAWKINS:

We look to you

As strange as it seems

When reality goes to scary new extremes

So don't ever give up

And this I guarantee

Next time you think no one cares

You can look to me



DEE DEE (spoken):

Thank you, that means a lot



MR. HAWKINS (spoken):

No, thank you
