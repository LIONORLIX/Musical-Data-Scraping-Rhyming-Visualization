Time to Dance


ALYSSA:

I just wanna dance with you

Let the whole world melt away

And dance with you



ALYSSA & EMMA:

Who cares what other people say

And when we're through

No one can convince us we were wrong

All it takes you and me



EMMA:

And a song



ALYSSA:

I just wanna dance with you



EMMA:

Let the whole world melt away and



ALYSSA:

I just wanna



BOTH:

Dance with you



BARRY (spoken):

Alright people, let's get down to business. We gotta make this place look fabulous!



EMMA (spoken):

It's gotta be perfect. Kids from across the entire state are coming, so let's do this right



(sung)

One thing you've taught me

Is how much people enjoy a show

And so you've got me

Debating how this whole night should go

Kids will be watching

To see who every guest is

And so my only request is



Build a prom for everyone

Show them all it can be done

If music blares and no one cares

Who your unruly heart loves



Build it now

Make people see how the world could one day be

It might come true if we take a chance



But 'til that day comes

I say cue the drums

It's time to dance



DEE DEE:

I just want to dance with you



BARRY:

I just want to dance with you



TRENT:

Time to get dressed up



BARRY:

I'll be a vision in aqua-blue



EMMA:

It's time we fessed up

This year our prom queen will be you



BARRY:

Maybe I'll wear a tiara

When it's go time



ALL:

Get ready folks

'Cause it's show time



Build a prom for everyone

Show them all it can be done

If music blares and no one cares

Who your unruly heart loves



Build it now

Make people see how the world could one day be

It might come true if we take a chance



But 'til that day comes

I say cue the drums

It's time to dance



DEE DEE (spoken):

So is that what not failing feels like?



BARRY (spoken):

I think so, yeah. Pretty good, huh?



DEE DEE (spoken):

Yeah



BARRY (spoken):

I bought a corset. I'm gonna need help with the laces



DEE DEE (spoken):

I'll do you, you'll do me



EMMA & ALYSSA:

This is more than I dared wish for

It's epic and what's more

Tonight there's room for anyone

So everyone on the floor

Get on the floor



ALL:

It's time to

Build a prom for everyone

Show them all it can be done

If music blares and no one cares

Who your unruly heart loves



Build it now

Make people see how the world could one day be

It might come true if we take a chance



But 'til that day comes

I say cue the drums

And take to the floor

That's what the floor's for

So turn up the bass

Until the whole place

[?] their feet

And has to repeat

It's time to dance



EMMA & ALYSSA:

I just want to dance with you



ALL:

It's time to dance



EMMA & ALYSSA:

I just want to dance with you



ALL:

It's time to dance

Dance

Dance

It's time to dance
