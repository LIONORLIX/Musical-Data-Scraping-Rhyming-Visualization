The Acceptance Song


TRENT:

Flowers accept the rain

And grow more beautiful

Babies accept their mother's breast

So they can grow strong

I accept that i was born a handsome man

So join with me and sing this acceptance song



Let us accept one another

I know it’s truly hard

We're sister and brother

It's what I learned at Julliard



Bigotry’s not big of me

And it's not big of you

Let's all work together

To make rainbow dreams come true



(spoken)

Ladies and Gentlemen, two-time Tony Award winner, Miss Dee Dee Allen!



DEE DEE:

Acorns accept the sun

And turn to mighty oaks

Sperm whales accept fresh sea air

Through their blow hole thing



TRENT:

Blow hole

Bumblebees accept to die within a year



TRENT & DEE DEE:

And still they flap their soon to be dead wings



ALL:

Let us accept one another



TRENT:

Forget your politics



ALL:

We're sister and brother



TRENT:

And so let's not be total dicks

Bigotry's not big of me

And it's not big of you

Let's all work together

To make rainbow dreams come true



(spoken)

Ladies and Gentlemen, the non-equity cast of Godspell

And one-time Drama Desk winner, Barry Glickman



BARRY:

Accept me (x7)



ALL:

Let us accept one another

Join our fight today

We’re sister and brother

Make people hear us when we say

Bigotry’s not big of me

And it's not big of you

Let’s all work together

Let's make a rainbow



TRENT:

And make rainbow dreams come true



ALL:

Accept us (x5)

Let's make rainbow drams come true



(spoken)

Acceptance!
