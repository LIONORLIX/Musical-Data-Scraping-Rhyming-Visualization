Barry Is Going to Prom


BARRY:

I'm oddly excited

Perhaps that's because

Although it shouldn't matter

It somehow does



It's strange but I feel like I'm in a time machine

'Cause, guess what? It's like I'm suddenly seventeen!

So, book a white limo, uncork the Dom

After 29 years, I am finally going

To Prom



I once thought a night like this wasn't in the cards

Now I've got a date, a tux, and the whole nine yards

A rational person would just stay calm

Oh, since when am I rational?

Barry is going to Prom!

The Prom!



I wish I could tell that sad kid I was

To stop crying into his Cheetos

They say it gets better

Guess what? It does!

Who cares if you're a big ol' girl

Just get into that gym

And twirl!



Barry's going to the

To the freakin' prom!

Going to the prom



In showbiz, I never felt such a thrill divine

My date is a high school lesbian - still, it's fine!

And though it's been years, I might call my mom

And tell her that though it's overdue

All of my waiting is over, too

And if you're not happy, I'm over you

'Cause Barry!

Yes, Barry!

Look at me, mom!

Barry's going to

Prom!
