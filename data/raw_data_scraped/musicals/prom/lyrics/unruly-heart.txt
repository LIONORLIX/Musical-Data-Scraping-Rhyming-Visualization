Unruly Heart


Some hearts can conform

Fit in the norm

Flaunting their love for all to see

I tried to change

Thinking how easy life could be



I just kept on failing

I guess that was a sign

That there wasn't much hope

For this unruly heart of mine



Then you came along

And right or wrong

Feelings began to overflow

We had to hide

Thinking that no one else could know



And not having you near me

Was where I drew the line

So I had to conceal

This poor unruly heart of mine



And though I don't know how or when

But somehow I learned to see

No matter what the world might say

This heart is the best part of me



So fear's all in the past

Fading so fast

I won't stay hidden any more

I'm  who I am

And I think that's worth fighting for



And nobody out there

Ever gets to define

The life I'm meant to lead

With this unruly heart of mine



[spoken]

Hi Emma, loved your video where do I start

I think my parents always knew

Nothing made sense until him

She’s the best thing in my life

The only good thing

But were always hiding

You’re not the only one



[sung]

And though I don't know how or when

But somehow I learned to see

No matter what the world might say

This heart is the best part of me



So fear's all in the past

Fading so fast

I won't stay hidden any more

I'm who I am

And I think that's worth fighting for (that's worth of fighting for)



And nobody out there

Ever gets to define

The life I'm meant to lead

With this unruly heart of mine

Mine

Mine
