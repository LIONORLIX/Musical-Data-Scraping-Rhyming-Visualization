You Happened


(spoken)



GIRL

What's going on?



GIRL

Nick's got a promposal all planned out for Kaylee. She's gonna freak out!



(sung)



NICK

Since J.V. football, I've been adored

Big man on campus, but you're so bored

My life was perfect but so routine

I prayed for someone to intervene



Then something

You happened

And turned my life around entirely

And that's 'cause

You happened

And look what happened to me

So go to Prom with me, Kaylee!



(spoken)



KAYLEE

You're such an idiot, yes!



GUY

Hey Shelby, you're next.



(sung)



GUY

There's not one subject that I could pass

Before you walked into my Spanish class

Was my heart pounding? I won't say no

'Cause life without you was no bueno



Then something

You happened

And turned my life around entirely

And that's 'cause

You happened

And look what happened to me

So go to Prom with me Shelby!



(spoken)



SHELBY

Si! Si se√±or!



(sung)



EMMA

And no more hiding how we feel and more



ALYSSA

I won't hide if you're by my side



EMMA

Now that the Prom is back on track

And once we walk into that gym hand in hand



BOTH

It's pretty obvious there's no going back



ALYSSA

And that's a promise!



Before I met you, I was a mess

Not honest with myself, I confess



EMMA

I was so lonely, a total wreck

Just sad and hopeless, check, double check



BOTH

Then something

You happened

And turned my life around entirely

And that's 'cause

You happened

And look what happened to me



Something so

True happened

And soon it's time to share it publicly

And all 'cause

You happened

And said you'd go to prom with

Said you'd go to prom with

Said you'd go to Prom with

Me!



Look what happened to me!
