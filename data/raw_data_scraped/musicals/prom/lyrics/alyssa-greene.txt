ALYSSA (spoken)

She’s a complete and total control freak!



(sung)

The hair has to be perfect

The A’s have to be straight

You have to join the debate club,

On that there’s no debate



You have bible camp each summer

To keep you pure and clean

Endless rules apply

When you’re Alyssa Greene



The trophies have to be first place

The ribbons have to be blue

There’s always some competition

Or hoops for jumping through



Your mom’s made sacrifices,

So win homecoming queen

Cause it’s do or die

When you’re Alyssa Greene



And you wish there was a world

Where you were simply free to live

And when people criticized you,

You had no more shits to give



And in this other lifetime

When you tell yourself be brave

You won’t cave

That’s the one thing I truly crave



But your feelings have to be phony

Your weight has to be tracked

If you don’t like shaking pom-poms

You’d better learn to act



Just have everything perfected

By the time you reach eighteen

Don’t ask how or why

When you’re Alyssa Greene



Improve all of your strong points

And hide the things that you lack

Cause Mom’s convinced if you’re perfect

Your father might come back



You’re not yourself

You’re not what she wants

You’re someone in between

Your whole life’s a lie

When you’re Alyssa Greene



EMMA (spoken)

I’m gonna go public and tell my story. Will you do it with me?



ALYSSA (spoken)

Emma, you know I want to, but I can’t-



EMMA (spoken)

Wanting is not enough. I believe you have feelings for me, but I can’t do this anymore.

It hurts too much.



ALYSSA (spoken)

Emma, are you breaking up with me?



EMMA (spoken)

I guess I am…yeah. Bye.



ALYSSA

You’re not yourself

You’re not what she wants

You’re someone in between…
