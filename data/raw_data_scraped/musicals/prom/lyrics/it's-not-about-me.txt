It's Not About Me


DEE DEE:

I wanna tell the people of

Whatever this town's called

I know what’s going on here

And frankly, I'm appalled



I read three quarters of a news story

And knew I had to come

And unless I'm doing The Miracle Worker

I’m won't play blind, deaf and dumb



Listen, you bigoted monsters

Just who do you think you are?

Your prejudice and your oppression

Won't get past this Broadway star



Stealing the rights of a girl

Who is an LGBQ-Teen

I've been far too angry to google what those letters mean



But it's not about me

It's about poor...



ALL:

Emma



DEE DEE:

Emma, for can't you see

The ordeal she's been dealt

So hear my plea

Or here’s your next dilemma

How do you silence a woman who’s known for her belt?



BARRY: (spoken)

Sing it, Eleanor!



DEE DEE:

Her belt

But it's not about me



MRS. GREENE: (spoken)

Get them out of here! Now!



DEE DEE:

Go on then, threaten to riot

It won’t phase me in the least

I understand furious townfolk

I did Beauty and The Beast



I'm no stranger to slander

So my dear, you're not alone

The Post once said

I was too old to play Eva Perón



Eva Perón!

But it is not about me

It's Emma’s story, damn it



Equality

Should be this country's norm

Not Photography

Unless you Instagram it

Use #DeeTakesLocalYokelsByStorm



But it's not about



I didn't come here to make a scene

But I know how Emma's heart aches

And this is how actors intervene

Through fiery songs and dance breaks



But it's not about me

Although I'm rich and famous

Publicity is not my final goal

You needn't be backwoods ignoramus



Join me and we'll start fighting

Could I get softer lighting?

Wait, this is not about me



ALL:

This is not about

Wait what is happening?

This is not about her

This is not about



DEE DEE (spoken):

This is all about Emma

And not about

Me
