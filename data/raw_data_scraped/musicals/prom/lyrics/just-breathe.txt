Just Breathe


EMMA (sung)

Note to self

Don't be gay in Indiana

Big heads up,

That's a really stupid plan

There are places where it's in to be out

Maybe San Francisco or there about

But in Indiana, without a doubt,

If you're not straight,

then guess what's bound to hit the fan



Just breathe, Emma

Not everyone is that repressed

Just breathe, Emma

It wouldn't be high school without a test

Just close your eyes and count to ten

Go to your happy place, and then

Try not to combust

Just breathe



BOY 1 (spoken)

Hey, Emma! So, who is this girl you were gonna bring to the prom, anyway?

Like, I didn't know we had more than one lesbo in town.



EMMA (spoken)

You don't know her. She's new here.



BOY 2 (spoken)

Like an exchange student?



EMMA (spoken)

Maybe.



BOY 1 (spoken)

Whoa! Then why don't you just, like, exchange her...for a guy?



BOY 2 (spoken)

Dude, nice!



EMMA (sung)

Note to self

People suck in Indiana

Leave today

Pray the Greyhound isn’t full

Who knew asking out a girl to the prom

Would go over just like an atom bomb

And make things much worse with your dad and mom

And who'd have ever thought

That could be possible



Just breathe, Emma

Picture a beach with golden sand

Just breathe, Emma

Picture a Xanax in your hand

Try journaling

Or start a blog

Just end this inner monologue



Seethe, if you must

But just breathe



MR. HAWKINS (spoken)

Okay, I just got off the phone with the states attorney.

Like I suspected she thinks this is a civil rights issue.

This is a big deal Emma.



EMMA (spoken)

Oh shit…sorry



MR. HAWKINS (spoken)

We’ll get through it. Take a sec, relax. Come in when you're ready.



EMMA(sung)

Just breathe, Emma

Remember that thing called oxygen

Just breathe, Emma

Look at the crazy state you’re in

Just smile and nod

Although they’re jerks

Say namaste and pray it works



And like we’ve discussed

Just breathe
