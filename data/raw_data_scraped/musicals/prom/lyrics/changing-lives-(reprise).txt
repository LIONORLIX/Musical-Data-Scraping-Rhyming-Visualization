Changing Lives (Reprise)


BARRY:

We're gonna prove

That in this day and age

Being gay

Isn’t a crime

This is our moment

To change the World

One lesbian



TRENT:

Lesbian!



DEE DEE:

Lesbian!



ANGIE:

Lesbian!



ALL:

At a time!



BARRY:

We're gonna help that little lesbian

Whether she likes it or not

When you're a legendary thespian



DEE DEE:

First you help the distressed



TRENT:

Then you help the distraught



BARRY:

We’re going down to where the necks are red

And lack of dentistry thrives

Why sing and dance

When you can take a stance



ALL:

And know you're truly changing lives

We're gonna march until that town looks like

The end of act 1 of Les Mis

You don't gotta have a Ph.D. in Psych

To know that people kowtow to the folks in the biz



BARRY:

We're gonna teach ‘em

To be more PC

The minute our troupe arrives



ALL:

That's right!



BARRY:

Those fist-pumping



DEE DEE:

Bible-thumping



TRENT:

Spam-eating



ANGIE:

Cousin-humping



BARRY:

Cow-tipping



DEE DEE:

Shoulder-slumping



TRENT:

Tea-bagging



ANGIE:

Jesus-jumping



ALL:

Losers and their inbred wives

Will learn compassion



DEE DEE:

And better fashion



ALL:

Once we at last are

Changing Lives



BARRY (spoken):

Now let's go help that dyke
