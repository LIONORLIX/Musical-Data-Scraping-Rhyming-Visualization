Passover


At Aunty Honey’s and Uncle Harvey’s in New Jersey

My sister would hold her breath

Over the George Washington bridge

And we would laugh at her, she’d frown

Everyone, including Nana Ida would be standing by the front door

As pulled up and we’d count down

Four, three, two, one!

And we’d fight to be the first out of the car

Having come this far

Having come so far for this feast

This feast of new yeast

And the matzo balls are so hard when you cut them they just fly

Why?

Passover

On this day

We read of plagues and misfortunes then start eating

Uncle Harvey’s the cook

Ma laughed so loud that she shook

Cousin Gary is reading porn

We’ve run out of skull

caps some men are wearing

Acapulco Beach Club bandanas that really, really, really should not be worn

We are Jews from like the first 5,000 years

Laughing through our tears

Joyous, vulgar, anything goes

But we wear nice clothes

That’s the way I like remembering this scene: manic and high

Why?

Passover In the Passover prayer book We read about what Pharaoh MORE?
