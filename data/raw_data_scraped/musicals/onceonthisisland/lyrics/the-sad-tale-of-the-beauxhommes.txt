The Sad Tale of the Beauxhommes.

A history lesson!



[STORYTELLER]

The boy's name was Daniel. Daniel

Beauxhomme. A boy from another world.

Another people. A people descended for the

French.

[STORYTELLER]

Four generations past

In the time of Napoleon

There came to this island

A Frenchman, Armand.



[All]

Armand!



[ARMAND]

Armand!



[STROYTELLER]

And he built a great fortune

And he built a grand mansion

And he wed a fine lady

So pale and so blonde



[MADAME ARMAND]

Armand!



[MADAME ARMAND]

But Armand took his pleasure

With the women who served him

Black peasant girls from

The village beyond



[TWO WOMEN]

Armand!



[STORYTELLER]

And the loveliest one

Bore the Frenchman a son

Such a fine peasant son



[ARMAND]

For Armand!



[WOMAN]

A beautiful child.

The pale color

of coffee mixed with cream.



[ALL]

The beautiful one, the beautiful son

Beauxhomme



[STORYTELLER]

They named him:



[ALL]

Beauxhomme

The beautiful one, the beautiful son

Beauxhomme



[STORYTELLER]

And the boy grew to be a man

And the great war began.



[ALL]

Blacks fought against French

And the hated Napoleon

They fought for their island

And finally won



[Men (Not Armand)]

We Won!

We Won!



[BEAUXHOMME]

We Won!



[BEAUXHOMME]

And Armand sailed for France

By the seat of his pants

Driven out by his beautiful son!



[ALL]

The beautiful

One

The beautiful

Son

Beauxhomme,

Beauxhomme



[BEAUXHOMME]

What was his

is now mine!



The Beautiful

One

The beautiful

Son

Beauxhomme!



[BEAUXHOMME]

Beauxhomme!



[STORYTELLERS]

But Armand left behind a terrible,

terrible curse.



I curse my son



[ARMAND]

I curse my only son!



[STORYTELLERS]

I curse his sons



[ARMAND]

All of his sons!



[STORYTELLERS]

Generations



[ARAMAND]

All Beauxhomme yet unborn!



[STORYTELLERS]

In advance



[ARMAND]

Your black blood

will keep you

forever on this

island...

While your hearts

yearn forever

for France!



[STORYTELLERS]

The unlucky one, the unlucky son

Beauxhomme, Beauxhomme.

From bad blood to worse

The name of the curse:

Beauxhomme.



The despise us for our blackness,

It reminds them where they're from

The sad, sad tale

Of the Beauxhomme!

Beauxhomme!



[TI MOUNE]

Tonton, he needs me! Without me, he'll die!



[MAMA]

He will not want you, Ti Moune!



[TI MOUNE]

Please, Mama. Please Tonton. Give me your

blessing and let me go. I will go to him!
