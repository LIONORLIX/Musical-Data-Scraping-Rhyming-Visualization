Some Girls


Some girls take hours to paint every perfect nail

Fragrant as flowers, all powdered and prim and pale.

But you are as wild as that wind-blown tree,

As dark and as deep as the midnight sea.

While they're busy dressing, you lie here, warm and bold.

Some girls you picture, some you hold.



Some girls take courses at all the best schools in France

Riding their horses and learning their modern dance.

They're clever and cultured and worldly wise.

But you see the world through a child's wide eyes.

Their dreams are grand ones, you want what's just in reach.

Some girls you learn from, some you teach.



You are not small talk or shiny cars

Or mirrors or French cologne.

You are the river, the moon, the stars.

You're no one else I've known.



Some girls take pleasure in buying a fine trousseau,

Counting each treasure and tying each tiny bow.

They fold up their futures with perfumed hands

While you face the future with no demands.

Some girls expect things others think nothing of.

Some girls you marry, some you love.
