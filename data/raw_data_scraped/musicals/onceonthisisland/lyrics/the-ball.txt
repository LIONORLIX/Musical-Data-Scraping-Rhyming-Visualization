The Ball


STORYTELLERS

The grands hommes at the

Hotel Beauxhomme.

Dancing to their own little tune.

Waiting to see...Ti Moune!



ANDREA

Some girls are saying

She's simple as any child



DANIEL

Please, Andrea



ANDREA

Barefoot and praying

And running the halls quite wild!



DANIEL

Andrea



ANDREA

And is she as pretty

As we've all heard?

Your own pretty...

Well, what's the word?



ANDREA

So this is your Ti Moune. How beautiful she is.



DANIEL

Ti Moune, may I present Andrea Devereaux.



TI MOUNE

Hello.



ANDREA

I'm so happy to meet you

My dear Mademoiselle.

I've heard you're a healer.

And a dancer as well.

(Sings)

Won't you dance for us now?

Won't you give us a show?

Please, Mademoiselle...

Don't say no!



DANIEL

Don't be afraid, Ti Moune. Dance as you

always have- Just for me.
