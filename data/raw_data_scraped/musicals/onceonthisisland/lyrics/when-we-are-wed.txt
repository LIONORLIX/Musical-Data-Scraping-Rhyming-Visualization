When We Are Wed


ANDREA

My dear Mademoiselle

I have something to say

Something I fear was left unsaid

Many thanks for

All you've given Daniel

But do not be misled

My dear Mademoiselle

You dance so very well

I pray you'll dance for Daniel

And for me

When we are wed



DANIEL

Ti Moune, Andrea and I have been promised

to each other since we were children.

Our parents are old friends.



TI MOUNE

But Daniel...



DANIEL

This is how things are done, Ti Moune.

It's expected.



TI MOUNE

Daniel, please...



DANIEL

We can still be together.



TI MOUNE(Sings)

We'll race away in a car



DANIEL

I can't change who I am, or where I'm from.



TI MOUNE

AS silver as the moon



DANIEL

There will always be a place for you here.



TI MOUNE

We will live beside the sea

We'll have children

A garden

And a tree...



DANIEL

Ti Moune, I thought you understood. We

can never marry.



TI MOUNE

Oh gods... Oh gods... are you there?

Are you there...?



VOICES(overlapping)

There can never be anythign between a

peasant and a grand homme.

They despise us for our blackness.

Marry you! You are mad!

You're not supposed to be in here.

Now what can he want with a woman

like that?

If he lives, how angry the gods will be!

The boy has the will of the devil himself.

He'll soon throw her out!

What can a peasant do for a grand homme

but shine his shoes?

He will not want you Ti Moune!

Blacker than coal and low as dirt.

I can tell you this: they'll never stand before

a priest!

Some girls you marry, some you love.

Oh, Ti Moune, what has this boy done to you?

The girl will have the gods to repay!

The gods to repay...

The gods to repay...
