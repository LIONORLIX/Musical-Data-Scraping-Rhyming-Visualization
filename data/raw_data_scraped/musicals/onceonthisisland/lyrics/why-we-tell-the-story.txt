Why We Tell the Story


(spoken)

A tree that sprang up and cracked the walls of the hotel Beauxhomme

So that its gates could never close again

A tree that lived forever sheltering peasant and grand homme alike

A tree that watched over Daniel for his lifetime

A tree in which his children played



And one day as Daniel's young son sat in the shade of the tree

He noticed a beautiful young peasant girl high in the branches

Looking out at the world



And the spirit of Ti Moune touched their hearts

And set them free to love



(sung)

And she stands against the lightning and the thunder

And she shelters and protects us from above

And she fills us with the power and the wonder

Of her love



And this is why

We tell the story

Why we tell the story



Why we tell the story

Why we tell the story



If you listen very hard you hear her call us

To come share with her our laughter and our tears

And there's mysteries and miracles befall us

Through the years



We tell the story

We tell the story!



Life is why

We tell the story

Pain is why

We tell the story

Love is why

We tell the story

Grief is why

We tell the story

Hope is why

We tell the story

Faith is why

We tell the story

You are why

We tell the story

Why we tell the story

Why we tell the story

Why we tell the story



So I hope that you will tell this tale tomorrow

It will help your heart remember and relive

It will help you feel the anger and the sorrow

And forgive



For all the ones we leave

And we believe

Our lives become

The stories that we weave



(spoken)

There is an island

Where the rivers run deep

Where the seas sparkling in the sun

Earns it the name Jewel of the Antilles

An island where the poorest of peasants live

And the wealthiest of grand homme play

And on this island?

We tell the story.



(sung)

We tell the story
