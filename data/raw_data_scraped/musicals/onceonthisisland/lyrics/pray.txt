[PEASANTS (Varoius solos)]

He roared down the road

Like the devil himself

Going to fast around the curves

Sent us scrambling off the raod

Like chickens



[ALL]

He has what he deserves!



[PEASANTS (Solos)]

Papa Ge wants him

And Papa Ge will have him

The boy is dying before our eyes!

Help him!

Hide him!



[TONTON]

No, don't touch him!

Better leave him where he lies

Even a wealthy man

Sometimes dies



[TI MOUNE]

Please!

He needs help!



[TONTON]

If this boy dies in our hands,

the rich will send police!



[TI MOUNE]

He needs care!



[MAMA]

And if he lives, oh how angry

the god will be!



[TWO PEASANTS]

The only thing that will save

The boy's life

Is to send him back to his world!



[TI MOUNE]

The only thing that will save the boy's life is

me! Please, Tonton!



[TONTON]

I will find where he comes from



[MAMA]

Julian! No!



[TONTON]

I will find who he is, and soon!

But till I return,

You care for him, Ti Moune.



[PEASANTS]

And her long vigil began.

One day gone by.

And two days gone by.



[PEASANTS (Solos)]

The boy has the will

Of the devil himself

Clinging to life by one small thread

If it hadn't been for Julian's daughter



[ALL PEASANTS]

He'd certainly be dead



[PEASANTS]

Look how she bathes him

And touches and prtects him

She binds his wounds

And she rubs his chest



[ALL PEASANTS]

It's as if the girl's possessed!



[MAMA]

You need food

You need sleep

You just can't

Go on without

Any sleep

[TI MOUNE]

Mama, ssshh.

[MAMA]

Have some tea

Have a rest

[TI MOUNE]

His skin is hot

He needs me here



[BOTH]

Can't you see

How mush this matters to me

I know what's best



[MAMA, PEASANTS]

Now the sky is growing dim

And the clouds are racing by

And the gods are looking down

At a boy they meant to die

And a girl who placed herself

In their way

Pray!

Pray!



[PEASANTS]

Three days gone by.

And four days gone by.



I fear for the girl and her mother

As well

Nothing but trouble looms ahead

Monsieur Julian could be deep

In danger



[ALL]

Arrested, lost or dead



[TONTON]

Oh, Asaka, Mother of the earth

Guide the feet

Of this poor peasant man

Hear my prayer

Which way there?

And which way home?



[TI MOUNE]

I need herbs

[MAMA]

Your father

Gone,

[TI MOUNE]

Mama, herbs

[MAMA]

And you don't

Care

Oh, my god, what

Has this boy

Done to you?

[TI MOUNE]

Mama, ssshh.

He needs rest

He needs care

[MAMA]

Your Tonton lost

Because of you



[BOTH]

Can't you see

That he's in terrible danger

What must I do!



[MAMA, PEASANTS]

Now the sky is turning dark

And the wind is turning chill

And the gods are out for blood

They've been cheated of their kill

By a girl without the sense to obey

Pray!

Pray!



[MAMA]

Julian!

Where is my Julian?

Bring my Julian home!



[GUARD]

You want what?



[TONTON]

I've come so far and I need...



[GUARD]

Get back!



[TONTON]

I have some news for Monsieur...



[GUARD]

Get back!



[TONTON]

Monsieur Beauxhomme has a...



[GUARD]

Peasant pig!



[TONTON]

Please, I beg...



[GUARD]

You must be mad!



[TONTON]

I must see Monsieur...



[GUARD]

Monsieur Beauchomme!



[TONTON]

I have come so far



[GUARD]

So far to die



[TONTON]

I have found his son!



[MAMA, PEASANTS]

Now the sky has turned to black

And the wind is like a knife

Pape Ge is coming back

For the boy who clings to life

And the girl will have the gods

To repay



[MAMA, SOME PEASANTS]

Pray!

[PEASANTS]

Papa Ge, Don't

Come around me

[MAMA, SOME PEASANTS]

Pray!

[PEASANTS]

Papa Ge, Don't

Come around me

[MAMA, SOME PEASANTS]

Pray!

[PEASANTS]

Papa Ge, Don't

Come around me

[MAMA, SOME PEASANTS]

Pray!

[PEASANTS]

Papa Ge, Don't

Come around me

[MAMA, SOME PEASANTS]

Pray!

[PEASANTS]

Papa Ge, Don't

Come around me

Don't come

Around me

Don't come

Around me



[ALL]

Pray!!!
