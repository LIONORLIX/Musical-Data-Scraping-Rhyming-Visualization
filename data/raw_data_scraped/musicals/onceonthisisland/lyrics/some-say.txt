Some Say


ALL STORYTELLERS]

Some say...



[STORYTELLER]

How Ti Moune began the long journey

toward the city!



[ALL]

Some say:



[STORYTELLER]

Some say her feet were bare

And the road was long and cruel



[ALL]

Some say:



[STORYTELLER]

Some say she got a ride

From a vendor and his mule



[ALL]

Some say:



[STORYTELLER]

The gods pulled up in a car

And drove her all the way



[ALL]

Well, no one knows

How the real truth goes

But that's what some say!

Some say!



[LITTLE GIRL]

And how far did she travel?



[STORYTELLERS]

As far as you suppose



[LITTLE GIRL]

And how long did it take her?



[STORYTELLERS]

Much longer than your nose!



[LITTLE GIRL]

And was she ever frightened

Or was her love too strong?

And did she know she'd end up

In our story and our song?



[ALL]

Our story and out song...



[ALL]

Some say:



[STORYTELLER]

What happened when Ti Moune finally

reached the city!



[ALL]

Some say:



[TWO STORYTELLERS]

Some say they laughed at her

For her peasant feet were bare



[ALL]

Some say:



[TWO STORYTELLERS]

Some say the vendor man

Gave her shoes too small to wear



[ALL]

Some say:



[STORYTELLER]

The gods said put on the shoes!

It's a price you have to pay!



[ALL]

The shoes were tight

But she said,



[LITTLE GIRL]

All right!



[ALL]

Well, that's what some say!

Some say!



[STORYTELLER]

At last Ti Moune arrived at the gates of the

Hotel Beauxhomme.



[GUARD]

Stop!



[STORYTELLER]

But the gods looked down. The gates swung

open. And Ti Moune went in search of her

Daniel.



[ALL]

Some say...



[WOMAN]

Some say she

Scrubbed the

Floors

Till she learned

Where he was

Kept



[ALL]

Some say...



[MAN]

Some say she

Climbed a vine

To the window

Where he slept



[ALL]

Some say...



[WOMAN, MAN]

The gods just

Lifted her up

And placed her

Where he lay



[ALL]

Well, no one

Knows how the

Real truth goes

It all depends

What you hear

From friends

It's no surprise

It it's all

Just lies

But that's what

Some say

[LITTLE GIRL]

Some say

[ALL]

That's what

Some say

[LITTLE GIRL]

Some say

[ALL]

That's what

Some say...

[LITTLE GIRL]

Some say

[ALL]

That's what

Some say...



[TI MOUNE]

The gods sent me to make you well.



[DANIEL]

You're very young



[TI MOUNE]

I can all this way to be with you.

Let me stay
