Mama Will Provide


[WOMAN]

But on this island the earth sings

As soon as the storm ends.



[MAN]

And as Ti Moune set out she realized

She was walking with old friends.



[WOMAN]

The birds...



[THREE WOMEN]

Coo coo, coo coo, coo coo coo

Coo coo, coo coo, coo coo coo



[TWO MEN]

Sha sha sha-aah



[MAN]

The trees...



[BOTH]

Sha sha sha-aah



[TWO MEN]

Ba-oom boom boom



[MAN]

The frogs!



[BOTH]

Ba-oom boom boom



[WOMAN]

And the breezes!



[THREE WOMEN]

Oooooooooh

Oooooooooh...



[Man]

Ti Moune lost all her fear.

She knew Asaka was near!



[ASAKA]

You've never been away from the sea, child.

You're gonna need a helping hand.

A fish has got to learn to swim on land!



Walk with me, little girl,

Don't you be afraid

Follow me, little girl

Let me be your guide

A pretty thing like you

Will need a thing or two

And whatever you need

Mama will provide



Oh...

Down the road, little girl

You may lose your way

All alone in a world

That may seem too wide

But sit on Mama's lap

And I will draw a map

And whatever

You need

Mama will

Provide



[THREE WOMEN]

And whatever

You need

Mama will

Provide



I'll provide you:



Storyteller

Moss!



[ASAKA]

To soften the road



[STORYTELLER]

Rocks!



[ASAKA]

To sit on!



[STORYTELLER]

Trees!



[ASAKA]

To sleep underneath!



[STORYTELLER]

Sand



[ASAKA]

Fun for your toes



[STORYTELLER]

Plantain!



[ASAKA]

To fill up your belly



[STORYTELLER]

Breeze



[ASAKA]

To fan your face



[STORYTELLER]

Grass



[ASAKA]

For making your bed



[STORYTELLER]

Mosquitoes!



[ASAKA]

Ha!!

Bug will bite little girl

And the night will fall

All alone in the dark

You'll be terrified

But you will make it through

'Cause I am liking you!

And whatever you need Mama will

Provide!



Oh...

Walk with me, little girl

And I'll take you far

Round each bend, little friend

I'll be by your side

That's what a Mama's worth

To give her child the earth

And whatever you need

Mama will...

Provide!!!
