Forever Yours (Reprise)


PAPA GE

There were promises

Made in the darkness

Promises made in your sleep

Promises the gods demand you keep



You gave him love

Love he would soon betray

You gave him life

I am the price you'll pay

Sure as the grave

You must accept what is

Now your life is forever mine...

(He pulls a knife and seems about to kill

Ti Moune)



TI MOUNE

Don't! Please!



PAPA GE

Trade yours for his!



TI MOUNE

What?



PAPA GE

You loved him. You saved him. And he betrayed

you. Why should you die for him now?

Kill him, Ti Moune.

Kill the love you feel.

Prove that death is stronger than love and

you can have your own life again.

Just as if you had never loved at all.



PAPA GE

I am the

Road

Leading to

No return



ERZULIE

The Courage of A dreamer



PAPA GE

Secret of

Life

Finally his

To learn



ERZULIE

You are

Part



PAPA GE

I am the car



Racing

Toward

Distant

Shores



ERZULIE

Part of

The human Heart



PAPA GE

Now his life

Is forever

Mine

Forever...



STROYTELLERS

Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah...



TI MOUNE

I can't!



Daniel, I love you.



STORYTELLER

And Ti Moune was cast out of the Hotel

Beauxhomme, and the gates slammed shut

Behind her.



TI MOUNE

The gods sent me. They want me to be with

Him. Tell Daniel I'm here. Tell him. Tell him
