Waiting for Life


[TI MOUNE]

A stranger in white

In a car

Going somewhere

Going far...

How it must feel to go racing

Wherever you please

Flying as free as a bird

With his tail in the breeze

Even the fish in the sea

Must be longing to fly

Catching a glimpse of a stranger

In white racing by



Oh, Gods

Oh, Gods

Are you there?

What can I do to get you to look down

And give in?

Oh, Gods

Oh, Gods

Hear my prayer

I'm here in the field

With my feet on the ground

And my fate in the air

Waiting for life to begin



[PEASANTS]

Ooh la ooh la ooh la ooh la

Ooh la ooh la ooh la ooh la



[TI MOUNE]

Mama's contented and Tonton

Accepts what he gets



[PEASANTS]

Ooh la ooh la ooh la ooh la



[TI MOUNE]

Happy for tea in their cups

And no holes in their nets



[PEASANTS]

Ooh la ooh la ooh la ooh la



[TIMOUNE]

Happy to have what they have

And to stay where they are



[PEASANTS]

Ooh la ooh la ooh la ooh la



[TI MOUNE]

They never even look up

At the sound of a car!



A stranger!

Racing down the beach

Racing to places

I was meant to reach

My stranger

One day you'll arrive

The car will stop

And in I'll hop

And off we'll drive...We'll drive!



Oh, gods

Oh, gods

Please, be there

Don't you remember

Your little Ti Moune from the tree

Wake up!

Look down!

Hear my prayer

Don't single me out

And then forget me...



Oh gods, oh gods

Let me fly



[PEASANTS]

Oh oh oh



[TIMOUNE]

Send me to places

No one before me has been



[PEASANTS]

Ooh la ooh la ooh la



[TI MOUNE]

You spared my life

Show me why



[PEASANTS]

Oh oh oh



[TI MOUNE]

You get me to rise

Like a fish to the bait

And tell me to wait

Well, I'm waiting...



[PEASANTS]

Waiting



[TI MOUNE]

Waitng for

Life to

Begin!

[MEN]

One small

Girl

[WOMEN]

One small

Girl

[TI MOUNE]

Waiting for

Life to

Begin!

[MEN]

One small

Girl

[WOMEN]

One small

Girl
