Corn Mix


[STORYTELLER 1, spoken]

Now, this is where our little fable takes an exciting turn



[STORYTELLER 2, spoken]

We'll speed you through the highlights

We begin around eight PM

Go!



[BEAU, spoken]

A toast to the groom on the eve of his weddin' from his best man



[ENSEMBLE, spoken]

A toast!



[GORDY, spoken]

I'd like that!



[BEAU, spoken]

Maybe we should start you off with a child's portion



[GORDY, spoken]

My friend, where I come from, we have spirits

Named specifically for the tough urbanite

Who navigates a daily concrete battleground

Perhaps you've heard of something called a cosmopolitan



[BEAU, spoken]

Ooh, well then, we have underestimated you once again!



[GORDY, spoken]

Wow, that is so strong it could raise five kids on a teacher's salary

What's in this?



[BEAU, spoken]

Well...



[TENORS & BASSES]

Corn

We're talkin' corn

Just as sure as the day that you were born

In the east--



[STORYTELLER 1, spoken]

Stop! Then, eight o' five, go!



[GORDY, spoken]

I think this might be my last one for the night, fellas



[STORYTELLER 2, spoken]

Stop! Around eight o' eight, go!



[TENORS & BASSES, spoken]

Gordy! Gordy! Gordy! Gordy! Gor--

[STORYTELLER 1, spoken]

Stop! Around eight-fifteen, go!



[BEAU, spoken]

Tell us about where you're from



[GORDY]

Tampa

If you can't afford Orlando or Atlanta

Medicare, Metamucil and Mylanta

Will always feel like home to me in Tam--



[STORYTELLER 1, spoken]

Stop! By eight thirty, go!



[GORDY, TENORS & BASSES]

Woah, woah



[BEAU, spoken]

Yeah Gordy! Hey, this is my song, I love it!



(singing) Somebody will!



[GORDY, TENORS & BASSES]

Woah

[STORYTELLER 2, spoken]

Stop! Eight thirty-two, go!



[BEAU, spoken]

Really big!



[STORYTELLER 1, spoken]

Stop! Mm-mmm, mm-mmm. Eight-forty, go!



[GORDY, spoken]

My fam'ly doesn't believe in me

Growin' up, my parents moved around a lot

Sure, I always found 'em, but it was hard

I never had any friends, not what I call real friends



[BEAU, spoken]

Well, you do now



[GORDY, spoken]

I do now?



[BEAU, spoken]

Yeah!



[BEAU, GORDY, TENORS & BASSES]

Friends, my old friends

*Unintelligible drunk singing*

Something... together!



[STORYTELLER 1, spoken]

Stop! Then, around eight forty-five, Mazie, Lulu and her liquor all landed, go!



[MAZIE, LULU, SOPRANOS & ALTOS]

Here come the women and the woman of the world



[STORYTELLER 2, spoken]

Stop! And suddenly, the plot, like the whiskey, thickened, go!



[GORDY]

Hey, I'm not okay
