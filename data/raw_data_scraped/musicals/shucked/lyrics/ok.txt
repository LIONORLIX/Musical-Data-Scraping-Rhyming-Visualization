OK


[BEAU]

Hey, I'll be ok

First love never works out anyway

I swear I don't care

Sometimes i might look back, but I don't stare

There ain't no use in holdin' on

She already let me go

I'll get along, I'm movin' on

I'm just movin' kinda slow



No big deal, no, for real

Don't go and make a mountain of a hill

Yeah, I'm alright, don't I look like

I'm almost so happy I could cry?

There ain't no use in holdin' on

And livin' in the past

I always knew that she'd move on

I didn't know she'd move so fast



I never thought she'd give her heart

To anyone but me

No, I never thought a world apart

Is where I'd turn out to be

And I wanted to be happy

So I pretend to be

And if she should ever ask me

I'll just make believe



Cause hey, I'm ok

Fake 'til you make it, so they say

Even if my heart says there's no way

I'll be ok
