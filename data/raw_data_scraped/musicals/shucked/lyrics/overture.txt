Overture


[PEANUT, spoken]

Good morning, Cob County!

This is Peanut with Morning Stark Radio

Here's what's goin' on

Yesterday, Buddy Wilson was attacked by a mob of clowns

When asked how he escaped, he said "I went for the juggler"

Oh, and today is the big weddin'!

In preparation, we ask that you turn off your tractors, your silos, your phones

And anything else than might get turned on

The couple also asks that you don't take pictures, make films or mow any crop circles

That might capture any part of this here ceremony

And now, some music from the Shucked orchestra

Conducted by Jason Howland

To start your mornin' plowin'!
