Woman of the World


[Mazie]

Tampa

I've gone from polaroid to panorama

What will I tell Lulu or my grandpa?

'Cause a kiss just flipped the script right here in Tampa

In Tampa

How can I go back home when everything has changed?

Guess the only way to go back home's the same way that you came



Well, they said I couldn't do it

Oh, but someone had to do it

We didn't have a chance but now we do

The future's lookin' clearer

And there's someone in the mirror

Who's lookin' like a hero

Well, guess who

That someone looks an awful lot lik? me

Who'd have guess?d who I'd turn out to be?



I'm not that small town naive little girl

I've always known, that girl has grown

I used to be in overalls and curls

But that little girl is a woman of the world



They thought they knew everything about me

That I couldn't do it on my own

But that corn wouldn't stand a chance without me

They'll never doubt me once I get back home



'Cause I'm not that small town naive little girl

I've always been, so don't fence me in

I've given that big city life a whirl

And this little girl is a woman of the world



Oh, I'm a woman, I'm a woman of the world

I went across the country but I'm not just some country girl

I've seen the skyline and an ocean full of pearl

So never underestimate a woman of the world



[Mazie & Ensemble]

Oh, I'm a woman, I'm a woman of the world (Our Mazie's comin' home, our Mazie's comin' home)

I went across the country but I'm not just some country girl (Our Mazie's comin')

I've seen the skyline (Oh) and an ocean full of pearl (Ocean full of pearl)

So never underestimate



[All]

A woman of the world



[Ensemble]

Our Mazie's comin' home

Wait, where did she go?

Wow, our Mazie's grown!



[Mazie & Ensemble]

No, I'm not that small town naive little girl (Oh, oh, oh)

You've always known (Always known)

That girl has grown (Oh)

You still see me in overalls and curls (Oh, oh, oh)

But that little girl (Oh, oh, oh)

Is a woman of the world

Yeah, this little girl (Little girl)

(Little girl)

Is a woman of the world
