Corn


STORYTELLER 1:

Well, I bet you heard

If you ever read the word

Of the Good Book, it took God

Seven days to make the Earth



STORYTELLER 2:

And he made the moon and stars

And the sun out of?gold

But?there’s?one part of?the story

That’s very?seldom told



STORYTELLER 1:

You see, He took a little cow

And He made a little udder



STORYTELLER 2:

Squeezed a little milk

And He made a little butter



STORYTELLER 1:

He laid out a little spread



STORYTELLER 2:

Then He broke a little bread



BOTH:

Th?n the best idea H? ever had

Popped into His head



Corn!

Yes, we said corn

Just as sure as the day that you were born

In the evening, it's for supper

Then it’s grits in the morn

No, it ain’t our bread that’s buttered

No, it’s corn



STORYTELLER 1: (spoken)

We’re here to tell you a fable



STORYTELLER 2: (spoken)

A farm-to-fable



STORYTELLER 1: (spoken)

Ooh!

About a simple place time forgot



STORYTELLER 2: (spoken)

Called Cob County



STORYTELLER 1: (spoken)

Now, I know when some of you think “small towns”

You think “gun-toting rusted-truck hay seeds

Who think liberal is how you pour your whiskey

And fluid belongs in your gas tank”

But I want you to open your minds

And think even smaller!



STORYTELLER 2: (spoken)

Somewhere north of south and south of north

To a place where being

from somewhere is who you are



STORYTELLER 1: (spoken)

Filled with people no different from you or me

Well, more you



STORYTELLER 2: (spoken)

Proud, simple people

Who, more than anything,

Loved their corn!



STORYTELLER 1:

They say it came from Mexico

Some seven-thousand years ago



STORYTELLER 2:

Somewhere between right now

and dinosaurs



STORYTELLER 1:

Cut to the 1400’s



STORYTELLER 2:

Christopher Columbus

Brought syphilis and smallpox to the shore



BOTH:

And took credit for



COMPANY:

Corn!

I’m talking corn

When it’s popping up in rows

It’s just like Norman Rockwell

Had a fresh new hand

And saw the technicolor morn

It’s Kentucky and it’s Kansas

Yeah, it’s corn



STORYTELLER 1: (spoken)

It grew everywhere in tall proud rows!

Corn rows!



STORYTELLER 2: (spoken)

O-krrrrr



STORYTELLER 1: (spoken)

Nuh-uh, don’t do that!



STORYTELLER 2: (spoken)

Okay



STORYTELLER 1: (spoken)

It popped up on every property line



STORYTELLER 2: (spoken)

Forming a huge corn wall

that completely surrounded the town



STORYTELLER 1: (spoken)

Because of that

no one had ever left

or come to Cob County



STORYTELLER 2: (spoken)

Oh, they knew of the outside world

They just wanted no part of it



STORYTELLER 1:

The way history is written

Jump into the first Thanksgiving

The Indians brought something

The called maize



STORYTELLER 2:

Around eleven-thirty

The pilgrims stuffed a turkey

Slipped into a tryptophanic haze



COMPANY:

With leftovers for days and days



Of corn!

Yeah, I heard corn

Got us through the Great Depression

and the storms



STORYTELLER 2:

They turned it into alcohol!



STORYTELLER 1:

Yeah, that’s my favorite form!



COMPANY:

It’s mazola and it’s ethanol

It’s corn!



We were corn-bred, we were corn-fed

Out here, we really feel like we were chosen

We love corn flakes, we love corn cakes

Don’t know where

We would be without that golden corn



STORYTELLER 1: (spoken)

And on this day, vows were written

For a wedding that almost didn’t happen



MAIZY:

Maybe love is like a dream

A couple vows, a couple rings



BEAU:

It’s a promise that you make

That two hearts will never break



MAIZY:

Maybe love is like a song



BEAU:

All at once, you sing along



MAIZY & BEAU:

Doesn’t have to be that hard

When it’s written in the stars

Maybe love is like a seed

A little sun is all you need

A little rain, and so it goes



COMPANY:

It grows and grows in rows and rows from dust



MAIZY & BEAU:

Maybe love just need a little…



STORYTELLER 1:

Sweet corn, street corn



STORYTELLER 2:

It’s really hard to beat corn



STORYTELLER 1:

Hands or feet, no wrong way to eat corn



STORYTELLER 2:

It’s a resource that’s always renewable



STORYTELLER 1:

Bring it to a bris



STORYTELLER 2:

Or a wedding



BOTH:

Or a funeral!



STORYTELLER 2:

Cook on the cob



STORYTELLER 1:

Or in a tortilla



STORYTELLER 2:

You can even make it an onomatopoeia



STORYTELLER 1:

Candy corn, kettle corn, put it in your mouth



STORYTELLERS:

It’s the same going in coming out



Sweet corn, street corn

It’s really hard to beat corn

Hands or feet, no wrong way to eat corn

It’s a resource that’s always renewable



COMPANY:

Bring it to a bris!



STORYTELLERS:

Or a wedding or a funeral!

Cook on the cob

Or in a tortilla

You can even make it an onomatopoeia

Candy corn, kettle corn, put it in your mouth



COMPANY:

It’s the same going in coming out



Sweet corn, street corn

It’s really hard to beat corn

Hands or feet, no wrong way to eat corn

It’s a resource that’s always renewable



STORYTELLER 1:

Bring it to a bris!



STORYTELLER 2: (spoken)

God!



COMPANY:

It’s got the juice!



Sweet, street, hands, feet

Cook it, pop it, baby, bris

Ashes to ashes and dust into dust

We give to the corn cause the corn gives to us



Corn!

All kinds of corn

It’s our living



STORYTELLER 1:

It’s our



COMPANY:

Loving!



STORYTELLER 1:

It’s our corn!



COMPANY:

And when we go right on up to Heaven

We won’t need to mourn

Just as long as the streets are paved with corn

When we get to Heaven

We won’t need to mourn

Just as long as those streets are paved with corn!

Corn!

Corn!
