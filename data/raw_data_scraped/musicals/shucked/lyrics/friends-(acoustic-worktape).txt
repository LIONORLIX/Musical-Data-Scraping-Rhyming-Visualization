Friends (Acoustic Worktape)


[BRANDY CLARK]

It's hard to say I'm sorry

It's hard to say I'm wrong

It's always been so easy for us to get along

For all my best intentions, I'm the one who's built a wall

If we're being honest, I've been known to know it all



[SHANE McANALLY, BRANDY CLARK]

The truth is I just love you

And with everything we've lost

I couldn't stand to lose you

'Cuz each other's all we've got



So let's not waste a minute

[?] ain't keeping score

Could you just forgive me?

If you forgive me more



[BOTH]

Sometimes, I call you crazy

Sometimes, I call you out

Sometimes, I call you up at 2 AM

I call you when you're happy

Or when you're missing your daddy

I have to call you family, but I get to call you friend



My best friend, I'll be yours until the end

Blood is thick and whiskey's thin

When we're together

Friend, my old friend

Ins and outs, and outs and ins

We've been family all our lives, but we'll be friends

Friends forever



[BRANDY CLARK]

We've all got our secrets

'Wish nobody knew

I'm so glad that I'm the one

You've always told them too



[SHANE McANALLY, BRANDY CLARK]

And I'd give you my happy

If it made you happy more

Though I'd never take it

What's mine is always yours



[BOTH]

Sometimes, I call you crazy

Sometimes, I call you out

Sometimes, I call you up at 2 AM

I call you when you're happy

Or when you're missing your daddy

I have to call you family

But I get to call you friend

My best friend, I'll be yours until the end

Blood is thick and whiskey's thin

When we're together



Friend, my old friend

Ins and outs, and outs and ins

We've been family all our lives, but we'll be friends

Friends forever



We've been family all our lives, but we'll be friends

Friends forever
