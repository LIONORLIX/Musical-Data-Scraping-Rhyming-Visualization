We Love Jesus


[STORYTELLER 1]

Did you take a little tinkle?



[STORYTELLER 2]

Shake off your little dinkle?



[STORYTELLER 1]

The show gets even better



[STORYTELLER 2]

If you've had a little drinkle



[STORYTELLER 1]

It's looking like a wedding



[STORYTELLER 2]

But not the one you thought



[BOTH]

The only way to get there

Is right back where we left off



[ENSEMBLE]

We go to Church on Sunday twice

And even on a Wednesday night

So our chances into the Pearly Gates are triple

That leaves us five whole days of sin

All kinds of crazy to get in

Yeah, we love Jesus

But we drink a little



[ENSEMBLE]

A little too much, a little too often

When we get started, there's no stoppin'

When someone busts out a banjo or a fiddle

He turned water into wine

We turn corn into shine

Yeah, we love Jesus

But we drink a little



We're up with the rooster, man

Got achin' backs and calloused hands

With Uncle Sam squeezin' every nickel

Yeah, even Saint Peter has his fun

After a long work week is done

Yeah, we love Jesus

But we drink a little



A little too late, a little too early

You get bored or you get thirsty

Yeah, we got just the thing to wet your whistle

He turned water into wine

We turn corn into shine

Yeah, we love Jesus

But we drink a little



Oh, oh, oh, oh

Oh, oh, oh

Oh, oh, oh, oh

Oh, oh, oh

[STORYTELLER 1]

Like a little jig

Like a little jug

Like a little kiss



[STORYTELLERS]

And we like a little hug



[MAZIE]

Like a little bacon

And we like a little beans



[STORYTELLER 1]

Love a little butt



[MAZIE & STORYTELLER 1]

In some tight blue jeans



[STORYTELLER 1]

We love a little cow



[ENSEMBLE]

Love a little cow



[MAZIE]

And we like a little tippin'

[ENSEMBLE]

Like a little tippin'



[STORYTELLER 1]

Like a little skin



[ENSEMBLE]

Like a little skin



[MAZIE & STORYTELLER 1]

In our skinny dippin'



[COMPANY]

We like a little shot

We like a little chew

We love a little cock and a doodle-doodle-doo



[ENSEMBLE]

A little too much, a little too often

When we get started, there's no stoppin'

When someone busts out a banjo or a fiddle

He turned water into wine

We turn corn into shine

Yeah, we love Jesus



We love Jesus, Buddha

Allah, Oprah

Dolly Parton

Deepak Chopra

We love Jesus

But we drink a little

Yeah!
