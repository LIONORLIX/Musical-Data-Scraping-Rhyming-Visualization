Somebody Will


[VERSE 1]

I was raised on the Bible and a hammer and a nail

When I wasn't raisin' corn I was raisin' Hell

I call my daddy sir and I call my mama ma'am

If I ever talked back I got the back of her hand

If you ask me I turned out okay

My dogs are fed and my soul is saved

I'm a damn good man with my hands in the field

If she don't want me well

Somebody will

Yeah somebody will (Aw yeah)



[VERSE 2]

Well I'm pretty good lookin' if you look around here

I can skin a buck and never spill my beer

I'll pay for dinner and I'll open up the door

Manners like that don't matter no more

I'm an old fashioned guy in an old fashioned world

Up until now I had an old fashioned girl

I'm a damn good man and my crops get tilled

If she don't want me well

Somebody will

Somebody will



[BRIDGE]

Bet I'll hook another probably won't take a week

There's a lot of fish even in a little creek

When I do she's gonna want me back

And when she does she can kiss my --

After all I say I'm a pretty good catch

My hay's all bailed and my jeans are patched

I'm a damn good man with a rod and a reel

If she don't want me well

If she don't want me hell

Somebody will

(Oooh)



[OUTRO]

Yeah

(Oooh)

Ooo-ohh

Aw somebody will



Yeah yeah yeah

(Oooh)

Oh somebody will

(Oooh)



Yeah somebody will

Some some s-some-some somebody will

(Oooh)

Hey

I said somebody will

Ohh I said somebody will

Yeah somebody will
