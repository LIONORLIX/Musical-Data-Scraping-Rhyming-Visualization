Going Down


Me and Lucifer

Lucifer and me

Just like the angel that fell

Banished forever to Hell

Today have I been expelled

From high school heaven



Elevator going down, going down, going down

Everybody going down, going down, going down



This is my doom, my humiliation

October, not June

And it's summer vacation

Such a disgrace

How can i face the nation?

Why should this pain

Bring me such strange elation?



Escalator going down, going down, going down

Everybody going down, going down, going down



Emancipation proclamation

Oh Dr. Lincoln

My head needs shrinkin'

Lu lu lu lu lu lu Lucifer and me

Doomed from here

To e-ter-ni-ty!



Going up, going down, going down, going down

Everybody going up going down going up

Down (Up)

Down (Up)

Everybody going down down down woah!



Forgive me if I don't cry

It's like the Fourth of July

Thank God that angels can fly

Down down down

Going down down down

Going down down down

Going down...
