Electric Blues


Tell me who do you love man?

Tell me what man?

Tell me what's it you love man?



An old fashioned melody



Tell me what's it that moves you?

Tell me what's it that grooves you?



An old fashioned melody

But old songs leave you dead

We sell our souls for bread



We're all encased in sonic armor

Beltin' it out through chrome grenades

Miles and miles of medusan chord

The electronic sonic boom



It's what's happening baby

it's where it's at daddy



They chain ya and brainwash ya

When you least suspect it

They feed ya mass media

The age is electric



I got the electric blues

I got the electric blues



Thwump... rackety... whomp

Rock... folk rock... rhythm and blues

Electronics explodin'... rackety-clack

Thwump... rackety... whomp

Plugged in... turned on



We're all encased in sonic armor

Beltin' it out through chrome grenades

Miles and miles of medusan chord

The electronic sonic boom



It's what's happening baby

it's where it's at daddy



They chain ya and brainwash ya

When you least suspect it

They feed ya mass media

The age is electric



I got the electric blues

I got the electric blues
