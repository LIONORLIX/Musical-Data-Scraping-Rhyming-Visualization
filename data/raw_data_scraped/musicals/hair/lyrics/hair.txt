Hair


She asks me why

I'm just a hairy guy

I'm hairy noon and night

Hell that's a fright

I'm hairy high and low

Don't ask me why

Don't know

It's not for lack of bread

Like the Grateful Dead

Darling



Gimme head with hair

Long beautiful hair

Shining, gleaming,

Streaming, flaxen, waxen



Give me down to there hair

Shoulder length or longer

Here baby, there mama

Everywhere daddy daddy



Hair, hair, hair, hair, hair, hair, hair

Flow it, show it

Long as God can grow it

My hair



Let it fly in the breeze

And get caught in the trees

Give a home to the fleas in my hair

A home for fleas

A hive for bees

A nest for birds

There ain't no words

For the beauty, the splendor, the wonder

Of my...



Hair, hair, hair, hair, hair, hair, hair

Flow it, show it

Long as God can grow it

My hair



I want it long, straight, curly, fuzzy

Snaggy, shaggy, ratty, matty

Oily, greasy, fleecy

Shining, gleaming, streaming

Flaxen, waxen

Knotted, polka-dotted

Twisted, beaded, braided

Powdered, flowered, and confettied

Bangled, tangled, spangled, and spaghettied!



Oh say can you see

My eyes if you can

Then my hair's too short



Down to here

Down to there

I want hair

Down to where

It stops by itself



They'll be ga ga at the go go

When they see me in my toga

My toga made of blond

Brilliantined

Biblical hair



My hair like Jesus wore it

Hallelujah I adore it

Hallelujah Mary loved her son

Why don't my mother love me?



Hair, hair, hair, hair, hair, hair, hair

Flow it, show it

Long as God can grow it

My hair, hair, hair, hair, hair, hair, hair

Flow it, show it

Long as God can grow it

My hair, hair, hair, hair, hair, hair, hair

Flow it, show it

Long as God can grow it

My hair



Hair, hair, hair, hair, hair, hair, hair
