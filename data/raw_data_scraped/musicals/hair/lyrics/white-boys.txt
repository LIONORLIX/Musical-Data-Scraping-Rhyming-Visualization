White Boys


White boys are so pretty

Skin as smooth as milk

White boys are so pretty

Hair like Chinese silk



White boys give me goose bumps

White boys give me chills

When they touch my shoulder

That's the touch that kills



Well, my momma calls 'em lilies

I call 'em Piccadillies

My daddy warns me stay away

I say come on out and play



White boys are so groovy

White boys are so tough

Every time that they're near me

I just can't get enough



White boys are so pretty

White boys are so sweet

White boys drive me crazy

Drive me indiscreet



White boys are so sexy

Legs so long and lean

Love those sprayed-on trousers

Love the love machine



My brother calls 'em rubble

That's my kind of trouble

My daddy warns me "no no no"

But I say "White boys go go go"



White boys are so lovely

Beautiful as girls

I love to run my fingers

And toes through all their curls



Give me a tall

A lean

A sexy

A sweet

A pretty

A juicy

White boy



Black boys!

White boys!

Black boys!

White boys!
