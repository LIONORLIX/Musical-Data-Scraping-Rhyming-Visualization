Air


Welcome! sulphur dioxide

Hello! carbon monoxide

The air, the air

Is everywhere



Breath deep, while you sleep

Breath deep



Bless you, alcohol bloodstream

Save me, nicotine lung steam

Incense, incense

Is in the air



Breath deep, while you sleep

Breath deep



Cataclysmic ectoplasm

Fallout atomic orgasm

Vapor and fume

At the stone of my tomb

Breathing like a sullen perfume

Eating at the stone of my tomb



I'm looking rather attractive,

Now that I'm radioactive

Just watch me spark,

I glow in the dark (She glows in the dark)



Breath deep, while you sleep

Breath deep, deep, deep, de-deep (cough cough)
