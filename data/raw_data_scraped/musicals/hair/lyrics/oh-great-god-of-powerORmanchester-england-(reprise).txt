Oh Great God Of Power/Manchester England (Reprise)


Oh great god of power

Oh great god of light

Oh great god of gas

Oh god, Oh god



Where has all the power fled?

Where has all the power fled?

He is light

He is sin

He is bone

He is air

He is



He is aquarius

He is aquarius



Appear, Appear, Appear



Manchester England England

Across the Atlantic Sea

And I'm a genius genius

I believe in God

And I believe that God

Believes in Claude

That's he
