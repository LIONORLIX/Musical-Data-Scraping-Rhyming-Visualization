Don't Put It Down


Om mane padme om

Om mane padme om

Om mane padme om

Shanti, shanti, shanti



Folding the flag means taking care of the nation.

Folding the flag means putting it to bed for the night.

I'm lost in the folds of the flag

I'm falling through a hole in the flag

Help!



It's a beautiful day in Selma, Alabama ya'll.

Don't put it down

Best one around

Crazy for the red blue and white

Crazy for the red blue and white



You look at me

What do you see

Crazy for the white red and blue

Crazy for the white red and blue



Cause I look different

You think I'm subversive

Crazy for the blue white and red

Crazy for the blue white and red



My heart beats true

For the red white and blue

Crazy for the blue white and red

Crazy for the blue white and red

And yellow fringe

Crazy for the blue white red and yellow
