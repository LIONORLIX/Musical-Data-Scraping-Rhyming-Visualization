My Conviction


You know kids, I wish every mother

and father in this theater would go home tonight and make a speech to their

teenagers and say kids, be free, no guilt, be whatever you are,

do whatever you want to do, just so long as you don't hurt anybody.

Right? Right!



I would just like to say that it is my conviction

That longer hair and other flamboyant affectations

Of appearance are nothing more

Than the male's emergence from his drab camoflage

Into the gaudy plumage

Which is the birthright of his sex



There is a peculiar notion that elegant plumage

And fine feathers are not proper for the man

When ac---tually

That is the way things are

In most species
