Frank Mills


I met a boy called Frank Mills

On September twelfth right here

In front of the Waverly

But unfortunately

I lost his address



He was last seen with his friend,

A drummer, he resembles George Harrison of the Beatles

But he wears his hair

Tied in a small bow at the back



I love him but it embarrasses me

To walk down the street with him

He lives in Brooklyn somewhere

And wears this white crash helmet



He has gold chains on his leather jacket

And on the back is written the names

Mary

And Mom

And Hell's Angels



I would gratefully

Appreciate it if you see him tell him

I'm in the park with my girlfriend

And please



Tell him Angela and I

Don't want the two dollars back

Just him!
