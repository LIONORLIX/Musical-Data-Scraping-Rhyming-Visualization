What a Piece of Work Is Man


What a piece of work is man

How noble in reason

How infinite in faculties

In form and moving

How express and admirable

In action how like an angel

In apprehension how like a god

The beauty of the world

The paragon of animals



I have of late

But wherefore I know not

Lost all my mirth

This goodly frame

The earth

Seems to me a sterile promontory

This most excellent canopy

The air-- look you!

This brave o'erhanging firmament

This majestical roof

Fretted with golden fire

Why it appears no other thing to me

Than a foul and pestilent congregation

Of vapors



What a piece of work is man

How noble in reason



How dare they try to end this beauty?

How dare they try to end this beauty?



Walking in space

We find the purpose of peace

The beauty of life

You can no longer hide



Our eyes are open

Our eyes are open

Our eyes are open

Our eyes are open

Wide wide wide!
