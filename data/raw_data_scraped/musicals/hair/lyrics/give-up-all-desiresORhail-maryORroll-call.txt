Give Up All Desires/Hail Mary/Roll Call


All you have to do

Is give up all desires

All you have to do

Is say Om

Stay home

Say Om



Nice, very nice



And eat lots of fruit and be cute

Be happy go lucky

Everyone should be Buddha



We are all one

No more war toys

Use high octane

And feel the tiger in your tank



Hustling is an honest profession



Hail Mary full of grace the Lord is with thee

Blessed art thou amongst women

And blessed is the fruit of the loom

Holy Mary Mother of God, pray for us sinners

Now and at the hour of our death
