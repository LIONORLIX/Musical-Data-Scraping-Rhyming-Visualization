The Sad and Sordid Saga of Cecile


[Princess Leonide, Agis, Corine, Harlequin, Dimas]



Like you,

I too was raised to revere

A soul that is pure,

A mind that is clear.

But fate had other plans,

I fear.

The day they laid my father to rest,

Before I could quell the ache in my breast,

The Princess Leonide (Le -o -o -nide)

Said it was best,

In fact she decreed,

She did not suggest,

That I be married to a person of her choosing.

Hubert, bert,

A cousin in on her mother's side,

Hubert,

Smelled of and cheese,

Hubert had a hair at the end of his nose,

And he barely said a word,

If at all.

He was not very bright,

Or polite

And he wasn't very tall.

I sighed, I cried, I pleaded and prayed,

But nobody dared to come to my aid.

The princess Leonide (Le-o-nide) remained unswayed.

The date was set,

The plans were made,

And she would not bedis-o-beyed.

The choice was marry, or... or... facede -cap -i -ta -tion.

I fled,

Yes, fled to save my head,

Away from the man

Who filled me with dread,

The one the princess would force me to wed,

To take into my virgin bed.

I'd sooner be

What? Old... No, dead!

Than face that ultimate,

That..God..That violation!

Hubert,

The name itself can make me cringe.

Hubert,

And the princess Le -o -nide gave chase.

They gave chase through the woods and the swamps

With a pack of vicous dogs intow.

And they howeled and they snapped...

I was trapped, and it... What?

Began to snow.

It's so hard to catch my breath

When I think how close to death I came.

Especlly when the forest around me...

Burst into flame!

And I ran through the smoke,

Through the dark and the heat

As embers scorched my legs and feet,

I ran by night

And slept by day

In ditches all along the way.

I twice fell ill and almost died.

Yes, what? Pneumonia! Yes, but I must confess,

I did not wait to convalesce.

I dragged my poor sick bones to find a town or village

Of some kind and met a merchant

Who was blind.

A man from... from... Macedonia!

He told me about this wonderful place.

He talked of the life you all embrace,

A life of order,

Calm and grace.

I longed for that in any case...

So then clad as a lad I appeared at your gate

In search of the man I venerate,

Hermocrates.

I stand and wait,

My mind a clean,

Unsullied slate

To edify,

To educate,

But alas, I am unwanted...

Yes! Unwelcome and unwanted.

Unwelcome and unwanted, unwelcome and unwanted, unwelcome and unwanted

Oh, please,

Oh Oh please, please, oh please, oh oh please, please,

Oh please, oh oh please, please, oh please, oh please,

Oh oh please, please, oh please, oh oh please, please,

Oh please, oh oh please please oh please, oh please,

Oh oh please, please, oh please, oh oh please please,

Oh please, oh oh please please oh please,

Oh let let let her her her

Let me let let let her her her let me let let let her her her

Let me let let let her her her let me let let let her her her

Let me let let let her her her let me let let let her her her

Let me stay!
