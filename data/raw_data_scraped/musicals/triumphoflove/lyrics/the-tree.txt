The Tree


HESIONE:

Poor little thing

pinched in

nowhere to go



HERMOCRATES:

Caricature of a tree



HESIONE:

Tied with a string

cinched in

bent like a bow



HERMOCRATES:

Not what a tree ought to be



HESIONE:

Shortened and shriveled and shrinking

what must the poor thing be thinking?



HERMOCRATES:

Trees cannot think



HESIONE:

Yes, But...



HERMOCRATES:

Still there's a link...



HESIONE:

Yes? What?



HERMOCRATES:

That's not to say...



HESIONE:

I Agree poor little thing stunted tied in a knot



HERMOCRATES:

Never knew what it could be



HESIONE:

Maybe it once wanted more than it got



HERMOCRATES:

Way of the world



HESIONE:

C'est la vie



HERMOCRATES:

Blind to its captive condition



HESIONE:

Cringing in silent submission



HERMOCRATES:

Trees cannot choose...



HESIONE:

Yes, but...



HERMOCRATES:

One might confuse...



HESIONE:

Yes, What?...



HERMOCRATES:

Way of the world



HESIONE:

I agree imagine, though if it were free to grow like any common tree



HERMOCRATES:

Above the house



HESIONE:

Above the hill



HERMOCRATES:

Express itself



HESIONE:

Exert it's will



HERMOCRATES:

A wild inpulsive flight!



HESIONE:

Perhapes one day it might...



HERMOCRATES:

Still, there are ties



HESIONE:

Clearly hard to ignore



HERMOCRATES:

Harder to break...



HESIONE:

So they say.

If one denies...



HERMOCRATES:

Closes...



HESIONE:

Opens the door

I would not stand in the way



HERMOCRATES:

You are still fairly attractive



HESIONE:

You are still youthful and active

what if you just...

Brother?



HERMOCRATES:

I think you must...

Sister



HESIONE:

Life is so short...



HERMOCRATES:

I agree

and ah what fruit the tree would bear



HESIONE:

A lusty fig



HERMOCRATES:

A rosey pear



HESIONE:

A bursting plum



HERMOCRATES:

A swollen peach



HESIONE:

Tumscent grapes...



HERMOCRATES:

Please, I beseech



HESIONE:

There are....

There are no words to say....



BOTH:

Perhapes, who knows,one day



HESIONE:

If i might say...



HERMOCRATES:

Please do



HESIONE:

If you insist...

I thought perhapes i'd misread



HERMOCRATES:

I meant to say...



HESIONE:

Please do



HERMOCRATES:

All that we've missed



HESIONE:

Life is so short!



HERMOCRATES:

So you said



HESIONE:

What if i suddenly told you...



HERMOCRATES:

There'd be no reason to hold you...



HESIONE:

So good to know



HERMOCRATES:

Truly



HESIONE:

One need not be



HERMOCRATES:

Ah yes, I see



BOTH:

Poor tree.
