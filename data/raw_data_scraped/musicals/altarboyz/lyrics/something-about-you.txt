Something About You


Matthew:

When I met you girl

I knew you were the one

I?d be with all my life

And I knew that I?d be making you my wife



So I hope you?ll understand my love

When I sing you this refrain

I believe in God, and so I must abstain



And I know that there is something about you, baby

Something I can?t even say what it is

But there?s something about you, baby

Girl, you make me want to wait



When I hold you?re body next to mine

It feels so good

And feels so right

And it also makes my Levi?s feel real tight



All my friends they think I?ve lost my mind (you?ve lost you?re mind)

And they tell me I?m a fool (fool)

But I?m doing what I learned in Sunday school (Sunday school)



And I know that there is something about you, baby (something about you, baby)

Something I can?t even say what it is (something I can?t say)

But there?s something about you, baby (something about you, baby)

Girl, you make me want to wait (ooh, ooh, ooh)



I mean it from my heart (mean it from my heart)_

When I say I love you so (I love you, I love you)

So please believe when I just say no (just say no)



Spoken: Girl, whenever we get this frisky,

I know it?s hard to put on the brakes, baby, I know.

But something?s making behave responsibly tonight.

It?s your special blend of charisma and spunk.

Crunk, I guess you?d call it.

But whatever it is, you got it all up in you girl.

You got crunk.



And I think you understand my choice,

And I know you see it?s true.

When I tell you that this hurts me more than you.



And I know that there is something about you, baby (something about you, baby)

Something I can?t even say what it is (something I can?t say)

But there?s something about you, baby (something about you, baby)

Girl, you make me want to wait (ooh, ooh, ooh)



At least until our wedding date

So till then, I?ll master

My own faith
