Number 918


He came into your life like a whisper

he took control of you in the dark of the night

he singes you with every glance

he has you, heart and soul, his old so tight



He makes you do things you dont want to

he commands and you obey

Take my hand, we'll stare him down

We'll show you what to say



Get the hell out!

Dont let him s tay insided you

rise up and make him take flight



Get the hell out! fight him tooth and nail

come on and walk toward the light!

we gotta get the hell outa here tonight!



If you lose this fight, you'll be his play thing for eternity

burning, baking, searing, flaming

doesnt sound like fun to me



Demons'll peel your skin off each day

try to scream, but you got no voice

if you want to avoid this fate

you only got one choice!



get the hell out

look to us for guidance

the altarboyz will see you through



Get the hell out

we got extra crosses

plenty of holy water too

we're gonna get the hell out of you



Ready? ready!

five four three two one!



the power of christ compels you

get thee behind me

get the hell out



get the hell

this is your last chance

face your demons eye to eye

get the hell out

face the consequences

now or never do or die



you gotta face the ugly truth

you gotta do what you gotta do

get the hell outa you

tonight
