We Are the Altar Boyz


[Matthew]

There's a brand new sound, that's going 'round the world



[Mark, Luke, Abe, Juan]

world, world, world, world....



[Matthew]

It's deep in the heart, of every boy and girl



[Mark, Luke, Abe, Juan]

girl, girl, girl, girl....



[Mark]

But it's not so new,

it's primitive and tribal... if you look you can find it, in Gideon's Bible



[Luke]

To the ends of the earth, we're trying hard to reach, every chance that we get,

we always like to preach



[Juan]

And we feel so good,

it never fails to please us when we spread the word of the one and only Jesus



[All]

Jesus!.. Now we don't believe in hurtin' or in hatin'

'Cause that's the kind of stuff that leads to satin

We believe in showing lots of love

'Cause that's the way to get to, heaven above
