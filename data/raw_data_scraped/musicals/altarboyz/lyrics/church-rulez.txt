[Juan & Luke]

Kneel and say a prayer to Jesus

Kneel and wash your sins away

Kneel and say a prayer to Jesus

[Mark]

Sit down, and listen to the homily

Sit down, and hear what the priest has to say

Sit down, and listen to the homily

Sit down, sit down, sit down today!



[All]

Then the collection plate gets passed at any minute.

And when it gets to you, you put some money in it.

And at the end of mass, a moment you can savor.

You get to look around and shake the hand of your neighbor.



Peace be with you, peace be with you, peace be with you, peace be with you.
