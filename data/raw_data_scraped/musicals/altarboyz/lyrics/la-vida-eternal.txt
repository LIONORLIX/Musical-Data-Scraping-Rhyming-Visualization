La Vida Eternal


[Juan]

You're lying in your bed awake at night

You're safe and warm and everything's alright

Your room is filled with cool and pale moonlight

When suddenly you find you're filled with fright



There's a fear that is so common

That you know that both your mom and dad

Are feeling it too

It keeps pouding in your head

You wonder one day when you're dead

What's to become of you?



[All]

La vida eternal is where you will be

With gates that are pearly and tall as a tree

Saint Peter will greet you

Your soul will be free

La vida eternally



[Juan]

The Afterlife is not a scary place

It's something that we all one day must face

For when it's time to the leave human race

We're still apart of God's amazing grace



Don't be scared of when you die

And please don't scream and don't go cryin'

And do not run away

(don't cry and run away)

Won't you take me by the hand

And let me help you understand

You're gonna be okay



[All]

La vida eternal is where you will be

With harps that are playing in great harmony

And angels with halos are all you will see

La vida eternally



[Mark, Abe, Luke, Matthew]

Now I lay me down to sleep

I pray the lord my soul to keep

If I should die before I wake

I pray the lord my soul to take

Now I lay me down to sleep

I pray the lord my soul to keep

If I should die before I wake

I pray the lord my soul to take



[Juan]

La vida eternal

Your heart will be happy

And filled with much glee

You'll no longer suffer from anxiety

La vida eternally
