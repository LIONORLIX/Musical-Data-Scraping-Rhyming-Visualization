Twenty Million People


BENJY

My name is Benjy Stone and 1954 was my favorite year

Not my best year, not the year I had the most success but my favorite year

It`s the year that separated my life into before and after

You see, in 1954 I made the jump from smartass kid

from the deli pushing a joke with every cruller to Freshman Writer on TV?s hottest show

The King Kaiser Comedy Cavalcade and every Saturday night at 8 p.m. we went on the air live!



ANNOUNCER

Five minutes!



BENJY

God, once, just once I wanted to sneak in and diddle the clocks

so we?d go on the air five minutes early so America would see the show before the show

But back then, they were a lot more careful about violence on television



KING KAISER

Aaah!

I?m missing a button



SY

This is crap!



K.C.

Who?s missing the last two pages?



KING KAISER

They told me the caveman sketch was out



ALICE

Would somebody shoot me!



SY

Total crap!



BENJY

Who ordered the black new sugar?



CHORUS GIRLS

Together now, 5, 6, 7, 8!



ALL

Five minutes to go

From



Twenty million people

No, twenty million plus

Twenty million plus Americans watching us

Curling up on sofas

Calling in their pets

Passing out the popcorn

Turning on their television sets

Twenty million ordinary folks



KING KAISER

And your careers go down the drain if they don?t like the jokes



ALL

Ninety little minutes to get by

In front of twenty million people

Tonight!



BENJY

That?s King Kaiser, star of Comedy Cavalcade

A great guy



KING KAISER

This is Crap!



BENJY

Honest

And these are my fellow writers

Sy Benson, Headwriter, also known as the ulcer who walks like a man

And here?s Alice Miller and Herb Lee, two people joined at the funny bone



ALICE

Sy, these jokes are old enough to vote

You gotta make some cuts



SY

No cuts!

Nobody touches my material!

Nobody!



KING KAISER

Sy, you cut those dogs out of the monologue yet?



SY

Dead and gone, King Baby!



ALL

Twenty million reasons

We?re guaranteed to bomb

Twenty million small catastrophes

But we?re calm

Facing every challenge

Performing at our peak

Ninety little minutes up the creek

In front of twenty million people



BENJY

K.C. Downing, assistant to the producer

She?s nuts about me

K.C., we all set for out regular date after the show?



K.C.

Regular date, we don?t have a regular date

We had one date, at which you completely humiliated me



BENJY

I thought you liked my walrus impression



K.C.

I was planning to eat those breadsticks!



BENJY

I am love with the bread girl

It felt like paradise

It felt like war

It felt like

It felt like 1954

It was the best time I?d ever known

My first jokes were on the air

My first credits shining there

Benjy Stone

Oh, mom I?m kinda busy now



BELLE

Coverment?s when he picks up the newspaper in the morning



BENJY

BELLE

BENJY

BENJY

BELLE

Fruit would be better



BENJY
