Exits


(Billy)

Ah! Haven't you had enough to drink?



(Alan)

How many of you are there?



(Billy)

1



(Alan)

Then I haven't had enough



(Billy)

Look, you can see your daughter tomorrow. Take a shower, get some sleep, then call her.



(Alan)

I have an invitation. GOOD GOD MAN! There is an entrance to be made!



(Billy)

An exit would be a much better idea



(Alan)

Capitol idea! High drama of the first water, I should know



I'm good at exits I have practiced them for years

I'm at my best whenever there's a door

So many exits enough for two careers

I long since given up on keeping score



Give me a reason to stay, I say ignore it

If someone stands in my way, I step around

You'd like an exit? just name your exit

I'll give you exits by the pound



I've walked out on countless wives

And I've improved their lives

They'll say its true



Spared them tears and broken plates

I left them swell estates they opened wide their gates

and I walked through



I've staged the exits of all my closest friends

Just drink enough and watch your friends move on

I love those exits when everyone pretends

they're sad to see you go but glad you're gone



Now I sign autographs on pictures taken years ago

I sign a name that isn't mine to a face I barely know



So here's to him and here's to me

and all that's gone before

here stands that king of pictures

who will always leave the public wanting more and more



I walked out on Harry Cole

To Goldwyn hold the phone

Quit Louis B.

Used my name and fame and clout

and I kept walking out

till my career walked out

and wife and child walked out

on me



(Alan)

Benjamin, tomorrow I'll be sober and I'll remember all the reasons for staying away from her.

Tomorrow, Tess will be in Connecticut and the world will be...ordinary again.

She wants me to come and may be the last time she asks. I'm going with or without you.

So for the last time, where is the plaza!?



I'll walk in with head held high

bygones will all go by

whats past is pass

I'll walk in with open arms

and she will run to me

my child will run to me

As i walk in for her at last!
