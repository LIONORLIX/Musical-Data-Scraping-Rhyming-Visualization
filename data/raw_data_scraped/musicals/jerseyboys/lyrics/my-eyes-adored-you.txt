My Eyes Adored You


My eyes adored you

Though I never laid a hand on you,

My eyes adored you

Like a million miles away from me you couldn't see

How I adored you:

So close, so close and yet so far away



Carried your books from school,

Playing make-believe you're married to me:

You were fifth grade, I was sixth

When we came to be

Walking home every day over Barnegat Bridge and Bay,

Till we grew into the me and you

Who went our separate ways



My eyes adored you

Though I never laid a hand on you,

My eyes adored you

Like a million miles away from me you couldn't see

How I adored you:

So close, so close and yet so far



Headed for city lights,

Climbed the ladder up to fortune and fame,

I worked my fingers to the bone,

Made myself a name.

Funny, I seem to find that, no matter how the years unwind,

Still I reminisce about the girI miss

And the love I left behind...



My eyes adored you

Though I never laid a hand on you,

My eyes adored you

Like a million miles away from me you couldn't see

How I adored you:

So close, so close and yet so far



All my life I will remember how warm and tender

We were way back then

Though I'm feeling sad regrets I know I won't ever forget

You, my childhood friend



My eyes adored you

Though I never laid a hand on you,

My eyes adored you

Like a million miles away from me you couldn't see

How I adored you:

So close, so close and yet so far
