(Stay, stay, stay)

Oh, just a little bit longer

(Stay, stay, stay)

Please, please, please, please, please

Tell me that you're gonna

(Stay, stay, stay)

Now your daddy don't mind

And your momma don't mind

If we have another dance here

Just one more

One more time

Oh won't you stay

(Stay, stay, stay)

Just a little bit longer

(Stay, stay, stay)

Please, please, please, please, please

Tell me that you're gonna



There ain't no good in our goodbye-ing

True love takes a lot of trying

Oh, I'm crying



Let's hang on

To what we've got

Don't let go girl

We've got a lot

Got a lot of love between us

Hang on, hang on, hang on

To what we've got

Doo doo, doo doo, doo doo



You say you're gonna go and call it quits

Gonna chuck it all and break our love to bits

(Breaking up)

I wish you'd never said it

(Breaking up)

No, no, we'll both regret it

Baby

(Don't you know)

Baby

(Oh no, no)

Baby

(Think it over and stay-ay)



(Let's hang on)

Let's hang on

(To what we've got)

To what we've got

Don't let go girl

We've got a lot

Got a lot of love between us

Hang on, hang on, hang on

To what we've got

Doo doo, doo doo, doo doo



I can see

There ain't no room for me

You're only holding

Out your heart in sympathy

If there's another man

Then girl I understand

Go on and take his hand

And don't you worry 'bout me



I'll be blue

And I'll be crying too

But girl you know

I only want what's best for you

What good is all my pride

If our true love has died

Go on and be his bride

And don't you worry 'bout me



I'll be strong

I'll try to carry on

Although you know

It won't be easy when you're gone

I'll always think of you

The tender love we knew

But somehow I'll get through

So don't you worry 'bout me



Bye bye baby, baby goodbye

(Bye baby, baby bye bye)

Bye bye baby, don't make me cry

(Bye baby, baby bye bye)



You're the one girl in town not married

Girl, I'd marry you now if I were free

I wish it could be-e-e-e

I could love you but why begin it

'Cause there ain't any future in it

She's got me and I'm not free



So bye bye baby, goodbye

(Bye baby, baby bye bye)

Bye bye baby, don't make me cry

(Bye baby, baby bye bye)

Bye baby, bye

Why make me cry?

Bye baby, baby bye bye



Ahh
