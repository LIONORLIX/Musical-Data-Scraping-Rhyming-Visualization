The Four Seasons- Beggin'



Frankie-



Mmmm...Put your lovin' hand out, baby...

..I'm Beggin'...



(Group-3) & Frankie

(Beggin'!), Beggin' You, put your lovin' hand out, baby!(baby!)

(Beggin'!), Beggin' You, put your lovin' hand out, baby!(baby!)



Frankie-

Ridin' high when I was king

Playnin' it hard and fast cause I had everything

Walked away, and warned me then

That easy come and easy go and it would end





(Group- All 4)

I need you to understand

That I'm trying so hard to be your man

The kind of man you'd want in the end

Only then can I begin to live again



(Group-3) & Frankie

(Beggin'!), Beggin' You, wont you give your hand out, baby?(baby!)

(Beggin'!), Beggin' You, put your lovin' hands out, baby!(baby!)



Frankie-

An empty shell of I used to be

The shadow of my life is hangin' over me

A Broken man without a goal

Don't even stand a, Devil's chance to win my soul



(Group-3) & Frankie

(Beggin'!), Beggin' You, put your lovin' hands out, baby!(baby!)

(Beggin'!), Beggin' You, put your lovin' hands out, baby!(baby!)



(Group - All 4)

I'm fightin' hard to hold my own

No, I just can't make it all alone

I'm holdin' on, I can't fall back

Now that big brass ring is a shade of black



(Group-3) & Frankie

(Beggin'!), Beggin' You, put your lovin' hand out, baby!(baby!)

(Beggin'!), Beggin' You, put your lovin' hand out, baby!(baby!)



Frankie-

I'm Beggin.....
