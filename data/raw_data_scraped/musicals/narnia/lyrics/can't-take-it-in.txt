Can't Take It In


Can't close my eyes

They're wide awake

Ev'ry hair on my body

has got a thing for this place

Oh empty my heart

I've got to make room for this feeling

so much bigger than me



It couldn't be any more beautiful - I can't take it in.



Weightless in love...unraveling

For all that's to come

and all that's ever been

We're back to the board

with every shade under the sun

Let's make it a good one



It couldn't be any more beautiful - I can't take it in.
