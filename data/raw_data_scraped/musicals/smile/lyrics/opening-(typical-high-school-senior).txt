Opening (Typical High School Senior)

Dale Shears

Spoken: Hi I'm Dale Wilson Shears,

President of the young American Miss foundation with a public service

message from our national headquarters in baton rogue Louisiana.

I'd like to urge your local group to become a part of the young American miss experience,

thus joining thousands of Jcs, Elks, Lions, Bears, Kowanians,

Mystics, and Rotarian's nationwide.



[Thanks to Alyssa for lyrics]
