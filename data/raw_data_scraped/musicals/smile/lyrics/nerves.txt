BRENDA: (Voice Over) Good morning ladies. It's six A.M. Outa your beds and into the showers. Please take a minimum of time with hair and makeup this morning- we'll understand. Today is judge's conference day and it's what's inside that counts.

VALERIE: She's gonna win the crown with avocados.

SHAWN: I really doubt it... she's not white.



BRENDA: (Speaking) Ladies. Carol's passing out the day's schedule complete with your private judges interview appointments. You've been scheduled at random, not alphabetically. Oh girls- isn't it all exciting?



(Singing)

PATTI-LYNN: Yeah, I'm just thrilled.

CONNIE-SUE: I think I'll burst.

DORIA: Oh god, I'm gonna kill myself. They put me first.

ALL: My hair's still wet; my brain's still numb, but someone tell the lions, here the Christians come

Nerves!
