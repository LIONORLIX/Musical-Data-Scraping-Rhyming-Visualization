Unchained Melody


(Sam)



You know what?

What?

I love you.  I really love you.

Ditto!

Sam, why do you do that?

Do what?

Never mind

Hey, hey what

No don’t even try it’s not gonna work



Oh Molly, my darling

I’ve hungered for your touch

Oh such a long lonely time

It’s not working

And time, time goes by so slowly

And time, time can do so much

Are you still mine

Cause I need your love

Oh Molly baby you know that I need your love

Gods speed your love to me
