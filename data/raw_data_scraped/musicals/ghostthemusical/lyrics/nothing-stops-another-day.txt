Nothing Stops Another Day


Molly:



I see the sunrise from my window

It must have risen everyday

But I couldn’t see at all

The shadows were too tall

But I'm seeing it today

I could see the people speaking

Couldn’t hear a word they'd say

Just the echo of it all, passing through an empty hall

I’m hearing it today



Because the world keeps turning and I guess it always will

I can choose to turn around

Or I can choose to just stand still

Either way, nothing stops another day

I lost my life and all its meaning

And so I locked myself away

Padding my heart behind a wall

I couldn’t feel it beat at all

But I’m feeling it today



Because the world keeps turning and I guess it always will

I can choose to turn around

Or I can choose to just stand still

Either way, nothing stops another day



I know I have to let go

Of a life I’ll never know, hard as it may be

I’m trying to understand instead there’s another life ahead



Because the tallest mountain cannot stop the smallest stream

Winter can’t hold back the spring

No matter how dark it may seem

Come what may, nothing stops another day

Come what may

Nothing stops another day
