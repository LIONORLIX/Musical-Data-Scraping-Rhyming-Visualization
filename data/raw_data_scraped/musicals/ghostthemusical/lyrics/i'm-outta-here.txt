I'm Outta Here


(Oda Mae, Ensemble)



My mama’s always saying

The meek shall inherit the earth

It’s hard to be that humble

When you see the number

That’s my new net worth



I’m going to do some shopping

I’m going to make a splash

And everywhere I’m stopping

Jaws will just be dropping

‘Cause I’m paying in cash



I’ve got it and now I get it

For women of my means it means

That you don’t have to sweat it

Just live out your dreams



I’m outta here

I’m off to the Bahamas

Outta here

You betta pack my to pack my pink pyjamas

Far from here

As I can get from all these dramas

Phone in my reservation

For my permanent vacation

I’m outta here

I’m making my transition

Outta here

If I’m correct in my addition

It’s crystal clear

To someone in my position

I’m done with the departed

Rest in Peace

Because life just started for me



Stay out as long as I want to

Then I can sleep in late

Its hotel beach and casino

And my new friend Deano,

Will pick me up at eight.

There’s no doubt I’ll be making

The international scene

The carpets red where I’m walking

Paparazzi are stalking

The former psychic queen



The world will be my oyster

And I will be the pearl

And if your types rich and exotic

You know I’m your girl.



I’m outta here

I’m off to sweet Grenada

Outta here

Where I don’t pay for nada

No taxes there

Have a whole enchilada

Phone in my reservation

For my permanent vacation



I’m outta here

I’m making my transition

Outta here

If I’m correct in my addition

It’s crystal clear

To someone in my position

I’m done with the departed

Rest in Peace

Cause life just started for me



But you know that when you have success

Talking about a whole new level of stress

Making decisions under real duress

And then you’re dealing with the IRS

They say the money can corrupt your soul

Am I headed down that slippery slope?

And multi-millionaires can flip their lid

And I……

Could end up just like Britney did

I’ll take the risk



I’m outta here

I’m flying to Mauritius

I’m outta here

Where the crab cakes are delicious

Far from here

That’s where I find my three gold wishes

Phone in my reservation

For my permanent vacation

I’m outta here

Thank you for Aruba

Outta here

Just let me swim and scuba

Far from here

Just as long as it’s not Cuba

I’m done with the departed

Rest in Peace

Because life just started

Phone in my reservation

‘Cause I’m taking my vacation

Look it’s me I’m walking

Girl you’re not even talking

Talking to me

No more talking to me

Life just started for me
