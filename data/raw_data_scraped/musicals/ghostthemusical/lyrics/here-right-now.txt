Here Right Now


Molly:

Here right now

Here right now

This is what we're living for

This is when we give into the moment and let go



Here right now

Everything we're dreaming of

Is coming through if we step up and own it let it flow



Sam:

Seems like we waited forever

I know we're gonna get there if

We hold on tight



We've come a long way together

We'll just keep getting better still

Make the future bright



M,s:

Here right now

Here right now



This is where we make it everything we'll ever need



Here right now

Here right now



This is where we take it to the place we want to be



One foot in front of the other

We'll just keep getting closer if



Molly: this is why we gave it everything we have and more

Sam: we take it



As long as we stay together

We'll just keep getting better til

Molly: it really doesn't matter what comes after or before

Sam: we get there



Carl:

Time keeps running on

We can be sure

I know that once it's gone

We won't get more



All:

Why can't we slow it down

Til it's enough



Molly: so we'll be safe in the here and now



M,s: this is where we keep our love



12 bar rest



S,c: some day

Molly: here right now



S,c: some way

Molly: here right now



S,c: somewhere

Molly: this is where we make it into what it's meant to be



S,c: sometime

Molly: here right now



S,c: somehow

Molly: here right now



S,c: some day

Molly: no-one's gonna break this feeling you were sent to me



S,c: this is as far as we've ever come

Molly: here right now



S,c: but i know we've only just begun

Molly: this is what we're living for



S,c: we're gonna see

Molly: this is when we give into the moment and let go



S,c: i know life isn't always fair

Molly: here right now



S,c: this time we're gonna welcome prayer

Molly: everything we're dreaming of

Is coming through

If we step up and own it let it flow



S,c: we should be



All:

Here right now

Here right now
