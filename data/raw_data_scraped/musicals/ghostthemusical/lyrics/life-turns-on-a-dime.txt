Life Turns On a Dime


(Carl, Molly and Sam)



MOLLY

I went to the police



CARL

Oh you did, what did you tell them?

I mean well what did they say?



MOLLY

You were right, it was awful,

They brought out a file on this physic women and

It went on forever



CARL

A rip off artist ha,



MOLLY

Yeah, and the sad part is I believed her



CARL

Well sometimes we need to believe



MOLLY

Why? I was such a fool

I don’t believe in anything anymore

How can people do such things?



CARL

It’s not easy to face, what life brings some times

But things can’t be replaced life turns on a dime

You have to remember the love you guys knew

How much Sam cared, how much he loved you

Just think about Sam, and the times you shared

Open up that dam, and try not to be scared



MOLLY

I just feel so alone



CARL

You’re not alone ever, people love you so

You’re surrounded forever, with more love than you know

Your young you’re still young, and so gorgeous too.

There’s’ songs to be sung, a life waiting for you.



MOLLY

I don’t know what’s real anymore,

And even now I think Sam’s gonna walk

through the door



CARL

Don’t be scared



Molly & Sam sing together



Oh my love, my darling,

I hunger for your touch, a long lonely time, down

Down, down, down



Sam

I don’t know what’s real anymore,

And even know I think things can be like

Before, every time I start to rise,

Feel like I’m going to sink.

Going down, down down, down.



MOLLY

I think you should go now



CARL

Molly you shouldn’t be alone



CARL

Let your feelings out, don’t hold them inside,

you can cry you can shout

Then put them aside

We think were so clever we think we’re all fine

That we’ll all live forever, life turns on a dime



MOLLY

I wanted it to be Sam;

I wanted it to be him

I lost him once; I can’t bear it I can’t lose him again

I just wanted to hold on somehow.

I just wanted to hold on somehow, look at me now



SAM

Don’t steal my love, you’d steal my love,

you killed me twice

you killed me twice.
