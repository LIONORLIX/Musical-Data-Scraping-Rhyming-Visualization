What Kind Of Fool


There was a time when i was

Down and out

There was a place when i was

Starting over

I let the bough break

I let the heartache in

Who's sorry now



There was a world when i was

Standing still

And for a while was

Infatuated

And then he found me

I let the stranger in

Who's sorry now



What, what kind of fool

Tears it apart

Leaving me pain and sorrow

Losing him know

Wondering why

Where will i be tomorrow

I'll be remembering when



There was a time when i was

Down and out

There was a place when i was

Starting over

I let the bough break

I let the heartache in

Who's sorry now



What, what kind of fool

Tears it apart

Leaving me pain and sorrow

Losing him know

Wondering why

Where will i be tomorrow



Was there a moment

When i cut him down,

Played around

What have i done

I only apologise

For beeing as they say

The last to know

It has to show

When someone is in your eyes



What kind of fool

Tears it apart

Leaving me pain and sorrow

Losing him know

Wondering why

Where will i be tomorrow

What have i done

Who's sorry now

I've torn it apart

What kind of fool

Who's sorry now
