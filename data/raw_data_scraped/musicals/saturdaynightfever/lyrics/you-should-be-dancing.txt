You Should Be Dancing


My baby moves at midnight

goes right on till the dawn

My woman takes me higher

my woman keeps me warm



What you doin' on your back aah

What you doin'on your back aah?

You should be dancing, yeah

dancing, yeah



She's juicy and she's trouble

She gets it to me good

My woman gives me power

Goes right down to my blood



What you doin' on your back aah

What you doin'on your back aah?

You should be dancing, yeah

dancing, yeah



My baby moves at midnight

goes right on till the dawn

My woman takes me higher

my woman keeps me warm



What you doin' on your back aah

What you doin'on your back aah?

You should be dancing, yeah

dancing, yeah

You should be dancing, yeah

You should be dancing, yeah

You should be dancing, yeah

You should be dancing, yeah

You should be dancing, yeah
