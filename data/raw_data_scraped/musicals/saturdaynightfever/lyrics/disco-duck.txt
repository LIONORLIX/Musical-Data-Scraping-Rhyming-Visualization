Disco Duck


Rick Dees:Went to a party the other night

All the ladies were treating me right

Moving my feet to the disco beat

How in the world could I keep my seat

All of a sudden I began to change

I was on the dance floor acting strange

Flapping my arms I began to cluck

Look at me... I'm the disco duck



Duck:Ah get down mama, I've got to have me a woman, ha ha ha ha ha

CHORUS: Disco, disco duck

Duck:Got to have me a woman

CHORUS: Disco, disco duck

Duck:Oh get down mama

CHORUS: Try your luck, don't be a cluck, disco

Duck:Disco

CHORUS: Disco

Duck:Disco

CHORUS: Disco - disco - disco disco duck

Duck:All right

CHORUS: Disco disco duck

Duck:Ah get down mama, oh mama shake your tail feather, ha ha ha ha ha



Rick Dees: When the music stopped I returned to my seat

But there's no stoppin' a duck and his beat

So I got back up to try my luck

Why look it's the disco Duck!



Duck:Everybody's doin' the

CHORUS: Disco, disco duck

CHORUS: Disco, disco duck

CHORUS: Try your luck

Duck:Wave to me

CHORUS: Don't be a cluck

Duck:I'm so happy to be here

CHORUS: Disco

Rick Dees:Thank you duck

CHORUS: Disco

Rick Dees:For gettin' down

CHORUS: Disco disco disco

Rick Dees:Thank you so very much

CHORUS: Disco duck

Duck: You're welcome

CHORUS: Disco Disco Duck

CHORUS: Try your luck, don't be a cluck, disco, disco, disco...
