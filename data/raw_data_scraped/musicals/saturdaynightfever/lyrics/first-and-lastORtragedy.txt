First and Last/Tragedy


Here I lie

In a lost and lonely part of town

Held in time

In a world of tears I slowly drown

Goinhome

I just can't take it all alone

I really should be holding you

Holding you

Loving you loving you



Tragedy

When the feelings gone and you can't go on

Its tragedy

When the morning cries and you don't know why

Its hard to bear

With no-one to love you youre

Goin nowhere

Tragedy

When you lose control and you got no soul

Its tragedy

When the morning cries and you don't know why

Its hard to bear

With no-one to love you youre

Goin nowhere



Night and day

There's a burning down inside of me

Burning love

With a yearning that wont let me be

Down I go

And I just can't take it all alone

I really should be holding you

Holding you

Loving you loving you



Tragedy

When the feelings gone and you can't go on

Its tragedy

When the morning cries and you don't know why

Its hard to bear

With no-one to love you youre

Goin nowhere

Tragedy

When you lose control and you got no soul

Its tragedy

When the morning cries and you don't know why

Its hard to bear

With no-one to love you youre

Goin nowhere
