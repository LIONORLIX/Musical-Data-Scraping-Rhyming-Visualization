Nights on Broadway


Here we are in the room full of strangers,

Standing in the dark where your eyes couldn't see me



Well, I had to follow you

Though you did not want me to.

But that won't stop my lovin' you

I can't stay away



Blaming it all on the nights on Broadway

Singin' them love songs,

Singin' them straight to the heart songs.

Blamin' it all on the nights on Broadway

Singin' them sweet sounds

To that crazy, crazy town.



Now in my place

There are so many others

Standin' in the line;

How long will they stand between us?



Well, I had to follow you

Though you did not want me to.

But that won't stop my lovin' you

I can't stay away



Blaming it all on the nights on Broadway

Singin' them love songs,

Singin' them straight to the heart songs.

Blamin' it all on the nights on Broadway

Singin' them sweet sounds

To that crazy, crazy town.



I will wait,

even if it takes forever;

I will wait,

even if it takes a life time.

Somehow I feel inside

You never ever left my side.

Make it like it was before

Even if it takes a life time, takes a life time.



Blaming it all on the nights on Broadway

Singin' them love songs,

Singin' them straight to the heart songs.

Blamin' it all on the nights on Broadway

Singin' them sweet sounds

To that crazy, crazy town.



Nights on Broadway

Bee Gees

Here we are

In a room full of strangers

Standing in the dark

Where your eyes couldn't see me

Well, I had to follow you

Though you did not want me to

But that won't stop my lovin' you

I can't stay away

Chorus:

Blamin' it all on the nights on Broadway

Singin' them love songs

Singin' them "straight to the heart" songs

Blamin' it all on the nights on Broadway

Singin' them sweet sounds

To that crazy, crazy town

Now in my place

There are so many others

Standin' in the line

How long will they stand between us

Well, I had to follow you

Though you did not want me to

But that won't stop my lovin' you

I can't stay away

Blamin' it all (blamin' it all)

On the nights on Broadway (blame it on the nights on Broadway)

Singin' them love songs

Singin' them "straight to the heart" songs

Blamin' it all (I'm blamin' it all)

On the nights on Broadway (blame it on the nights on Broadway)

Singin' them sweet sounds

To that crazy, crazy town (blamin' it in on those nights)

I will wait

Even if it takes forever

I will wait

Even if it takes a lifetime

Somehow I feel inside

You never-ever left my side

Make it like it was before

Even if it takes a lifetime, takes a lifetime, ooh

Blamin' it all (blamin' it all)

On the nights on Broadway (blame it on the nights on Broadway)

Singin' them love songs (yeah, yeah)

Singin' them "straight to the heart" songs (yeah, blamin' it all)

Blamin' it all (blamin' it all)

On the nights on Broadway (blame it on the nights on Broadway)

Singin' them sweet sounds (oh yeah)

To that crazy, crazy town (yeah)
