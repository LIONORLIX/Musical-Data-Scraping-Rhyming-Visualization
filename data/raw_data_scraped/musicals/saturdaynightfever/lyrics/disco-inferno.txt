Disco Inferno


Burn baby burn! Burn baby burn! Burn baby burn! Burn baby burn!

Burnin'!



To mass fires, yes! One hundred stories high

People gettin' loose y'all gettin' down on the roof - Do you hear?

(the folks are flaming)Folks were screamin' - out of control

It was so entertainin' - when the boogie started to explode

I heard somebody say



Burn baby burn! - Disco inferno!

Burn baby burn! - Burn that mama down

Burn baby burn! - Disco inferno!

Burn baby burn! - Burn that mama down

Burnin'!



Satisfaction (uhu hu hu) came in the chain reaction

(burnin') I couldn't get enough, (till I had to self-destroy)so I had to

self destruct, (uhu hu hu)

The heat was on (burnin'), rising to the top, huh!

Everybody's goin' strong (uhu hu hu)

And that is when my spark got hot

I heard somebody say



Burn baby burn! - Disco inferno!

Burn baby burn! - Burn that mama down, yoh!

Burn baby burn! - Disco inferno!

Burn baby burn! - Burn that mama down

Burnin'!



Up above my head I hear music in the air - I hear music!

That makes me know there's (somebody)a promise somewhere



Satisfaction came in a chain reaction - Do you hear?

I couldn't get enough, so I had to self destruct,

The heat was on, rising to the top

Everybody's goin' strong

That is when my spark got hot

I heard somebody say



Burn baby burn! - Disco inferno! (Aah yeah!)

Burn baby burn! - Burn that mama down

Burn baby burn! - Disco inferno, yeah!

Burn baby burn! - Burn that mama down x2 Burnin'!



MUSIC TURN AROUND (12 bars)



I just can't stop

When(till) my spark gets hot

Just can't stop

When my spark gets hot



MUSIC TURN AROUND (24 bars)



Burning, burning, burning, burning 6X (24 bars)
