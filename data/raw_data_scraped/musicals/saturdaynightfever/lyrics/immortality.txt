Immortality


So this is who I am,

And this is all I know,

And I must choose to live,

For all that I can give,

The spark that makes the power grow.



But I will stand for my dream if I can,

Symbol of my faith in who I am,

But I am so lonely,

And I must follow on the road that lies ahead,

And I won't let my heart control my head,

But I am so lonely

And we don't say goodbye,we don't say goodbye

But I know what I've got to be



Immortality

I make my journey through eternity

I keep the memory of you and me inside



Fulfil your destiny,

Is there within the child,

My storm will never end,

My fate is on the wind,

The king of hearts, the joker's wild,

And we don't say goodbye,we don't say goodbye

I'll make them all remember me



Cos I have found a dream that must come true,

Every ounce of me must see it though,

But I am so lonely

I'm sorry I don't have a role for love to play,

Hand over my heart I'll find the way,

I will make them give to me



Immortality

There is a vision and a fire in me

I keep the memory of you and me, inside

And we don't say goodbye,

We don't say goodbye

With all my love for you

And what else we may do

We don't say, goodbye
