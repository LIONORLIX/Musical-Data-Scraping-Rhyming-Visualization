Laundry Finish


THE WASHING MACHINE

Washin finish! Sweet and wet!

And cool! My daily task is done!



THE RADIO

Time?s come to perspire!

Turn on that electric dryer!

Sucking moisture out the air,

melt the hairspray in your hair!

Turn it on, turn it on, turn it on,

turn on despair, turn on despair,

turn on despair!



THE DRYER

Caroline! Caroline!

Crank my little timer bell!



THE RADIO

Caroline! Mercy me!

39 and divorcee!

(Mm-mm-mm).

How on earth she gonna thrive,

when her life bury her alive?

Oh-oh-oh,

well it ain?t no mystery, she

took a wrong step,

took a wrong step,

took a wrong step,

slip and fell!

Downward bound,

underground,

found her sinful self in Hell,

found her sinful self in Hell.



THE DRYER

Found your sinful self in Hell.
