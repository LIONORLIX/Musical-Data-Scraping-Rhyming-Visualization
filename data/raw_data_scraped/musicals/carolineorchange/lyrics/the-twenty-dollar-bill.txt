The Twenty Dollar Bill


NOAH

The next day I go off to school.



ROSE

Noah, darling, study hard!

You should see his last report card, Papa,

everything Cs and Ds.



MR. STOPNICK

Look at this! The hypocrites!

Eulogizing, rhapsodizing!

Kennedy!

Kennedy!

They hated him!

They murdered him!

Did him in!

And now?



ROSE

Good morning Caroline.



NOAH

All day long I sit at school,

drifting dreaming in the classroom,

inattentive cause I?m BORED!



ROSE, STUART, MR. STOPNICK

Study, Noah, study hard!



NOAH

Drawing doodles, Maccabees,

bumble bees, Christmas trees

and all the toys I plan to buy with?

Buy with?

Buy with?



GRANDMA AND GRANDPA GELLMAN

Suddenly he sits up straight,

suddenly he can?t concentrate!

Suddenly open go the eyes!



NOAH

Suddenly I realize:



GRANDMA AND GRANDPA GELLMAN

A dreadful blow he has been dealt!



NOAH

Left my?left my?



NOAH, GRANDMA AND GRANDPA GELLMAN

Chanukah Gelt!



NOAH

All that money!

Twenty Dollars!



GRANDMA AND GRANDPA GELLMAN

Twenty dollars!

In your pocket!

In the pocket of your pants!



NOAH

In the pocket of my pants!

There?s still a chance!

Maybe she hasn?t done the laundry!

There?s all that cleaning after a party.

Oh please clock please clock

strike three now.



GRANDMA AND GRANDPA GELLMAN

Tick tock tick tock



NOAH

Anyhow

she can?t?it?s mine!

She can?t have my money! I?ll sue!

Aw come on, clock!



GRANDMA AND GRANDPA GELLMAN

It?s only two.



NOAH

I?m plotzing with anxiety!



GRANDMA AND GRANDPA GELLMAN

Alright, already;

now ? it?s ? three.



NOAH

Finally!

The second I hear the three o?clock bell?

I?m a bat out of hell!

I run down the street?like a blur!

and right away,

the washing machine!



WASHING MACHINE

Consequences unforeseen.

I?m on!



NOAH

In the basement! It?s on! It?s her!

The spin cycle?s already started to spin!

She?s down there! Wait! Wait! Caroline!



CAROLINE

What?



NOAH

Did you find??



CAROLINE

Yep, I did.

And now it?s mine.
