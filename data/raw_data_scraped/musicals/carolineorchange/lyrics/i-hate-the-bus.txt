I Hate the Bus


I hate the bus

I want my own car

A car with a heater

I want a TV set and more

A big old house



Like this one

But everything new

And cant nobody ever

Can't nobody ever tell me what to do



Go out when I want to

When I don't then I stay

Got magical bracelets

Some bullets bound someway



In every room a TV and my own telephone

And ill live in my house

And ill live in my house by myself all alone

And if I'm lonely it doesn't matter



I think there worse than being lonely

There's people who freeze while they wait on their knees

And they don't know for what

And they just been forgotten



I aint waiting no more

You just wait forever

If you cant say what for

The day comes soon



Ill pack up the nothing I own

And ill live in my house

And ill make it ok by myself

All alone
