Lot's Wife


Sixteen feet below seas level

Caught tween the devil and the muddy brown sea...



That money...

That money...

That money reach in and spin me about,

my hate rise up, rip my inside out.



My madness rise up in a fury so wild and I let myself go.

Spoke my hate to a child.

Pennies done that. Pennies done that.

Pocket change...



Pocket change change me, pocket change change me,

can't afford loose change, can't afford change,

changin's a danger for a woman like me,

trapped tween the Devil and the muddy brown sea.

I got to get back to the way that I been

God!

Drag me back to that basement again.

Don't know what I said to that little boy...



Always they's been people who

hold they head high gettin through.

I cain't,

Aint never been no good,

findin joy the way you should,

hopin water turn to wine -

hope's fine

hope's fine

hope's fine -

til it turn to mud.

And some folks goes to school at nights,

some folks march for civil rights.

I don't.

I ain't got the heart,

I can't hardly read.

Some folks do all kinds of things and

black folks someday live like kings

and someday sunshine shine all day

oh sure it true

it be that way

but not for me

This also true:

ya'll can't do what I can do

ya'll strong but you ain't strong like me:



I'm gonna slam that iron

down on my heart

gonna slam that iron

down on my throat

gonna slam that iron

down on my sex

gonna slam it

slam it

slam it down

until I drown

the fire out

till there ain't no air left

anywhere.

What else

what else

what else

What else God

What else God give me an arm for?



SLAM go the iron

SLAM go the iron

FLAT!

FLAT!

FLAT!

FLAT!



Now how 'bout that then?

That what Caroline can do!

That how she re-arrange herself,

that how she change!



Murder me God down in that basement,

murder my dreams so I stop wantin,

murder my hope of him returnin,

strangle the pride that make me crazy!

Make me forget so I stop grievin.

Scour my skin till I stop feelin.

Take Caroline away cause I cain't be her,

take her away I cain't afford her.

Tear out my heart

Strangle my soul

Turn my to salt

A pillar of salt

a broken stone and then...



Caroline. Caroline.



From the evil she done, Lord,

set her free

set her free



set me free.



Don't let my sorrow

Make evil of me.
