DOTTY

She was doing fine out there.



CAROLINE

This ain?t none of your affair, Dot.

You can?t talk to folk like that.



EMMIE

Talk to white folk what you mean.



CAROLINE

Lord I raised a spoiled brat.

They your boss! You can?t a queen,

gonna get yourself knocked flast,

you mouth off around white folk like that.



EMMIE

You tippy-toe till you been paid.

You the spoiled on! A maid!

I?ll never be a queen, that?st rue,

but I?m a damn sigh better?n prouder?n you!

Come on, teach me what you know!

Mama teach me what you know!

How to keep my head tucked low.

Come on, come on

Mama teach?



DOTTY

Watch your mouth now, little sister.

You too smart to act a fool.

Proud don?t talk trash to her mother.



EMMIE

You got plans, you go to school.

What she got? Only angry, always

fussin, always shushin me.



DOTTY

Ain?t seen you lackin food to eat,

roof above, shoes on your feet.

You watch your pride ain?t just conceit.

Think bein a maid what she prefer?



MR. STOPNICK

DOTTY

Go on, make things like they were.

Apologize to her.



MR. STOPNICK

A twenty dollar bill!
