Why Does Our House Have A Basement?


NOAH

Why does our house have a basement?

Underground is underwater.

This is where the Great Plains end

in the Gulf of Mexico.



ROSE

Go to sleep now, go to sleep.



NOAH

Rose?



ROSE

Noah?



NOAH

If there?s only water underground,

is my mother buried underwater?



ROSE

Don?t be silly, she?s safe and sound,

they buried her above the ground,

in a dry little house;

not even a mouse can get in , I bet.

Listen, your daddy?s clarinet?



NOAH

Good night, Caroline.



CAROLINE

Go to bed, Noah. Stop botherin the night.



NOAH

I?m glad you came back to work today.

Sorry I hid from you.



CAROLINE

Some day you won?t.

Someday we?ll talk again.

Just gotta wait.



NOAH

Will we be friends then?



CAROLINE

Weren?t never friends.



MOON (with WASHING MACHINE below)

Household rules and small decrees,

unsuspecting bring us these

secret, little tragedies.



WASHING MACHINE (with MOON above)

Household rules and small decrees,

unsuspecting bring us these

costly, quiet victories.



NOAH

Caroline?



CAROLINE

Mmm?



NOAH

What?s it like underwater?
