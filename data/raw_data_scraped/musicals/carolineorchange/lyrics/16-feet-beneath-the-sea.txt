16 Feet Beneath the Sea


CAROLINE

Nothing ever happen underground

in Louisiana

cause they ain?t no underground

in Louisiana.

There is only

underwater.



THE WASHING MACHINE

Consequences unforeseen.

Consequences unforeseen.

Put your faith and clothes in me,

a brand new nineteen sixty-three

seven-cycle wash machine.



CAROLINE

Sixteen feet below sea level!

Torn tween the devil

and the muddy brown sea.

Sixteen soggy feet below

The Gulf of Mexico
