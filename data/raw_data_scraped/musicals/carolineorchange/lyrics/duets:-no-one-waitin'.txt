Duets: No One Waitin'


RADIO

No one waitin to warm the dark,

no one hopin that I?ll wear red,

no one wantin to spark my spark,

no one needin needin to share my bed.



CAROLINE

Don?t break promises, Emmie,

do like you say you do.

Don?t give yourself options.

Most folks lives without em.

Most folks does without.



EMMIE

Lost track of time, mama,

sorry, Aunt Claudia

say she?d mind the children,

say she don?t mind minding them.

Sorry mama, I was out;

being shiftless, having fun.



RADIO (under CAROLINE/EMMIE dialogue)

Nobody?s arm to cradle my head,

to talk about news, talk about views,

talk about change,

bout the President dead,

bout how the day went,

or how time flown,

or life been spent,

or I?m all alone?



CAROLINE

What kind of fun?



EMMIE

You remember fun, mama;

out at the parking lot,

longside the A&W,

buncha us talking,

dancing to the radio.



CAROLINE

The President?s dead.



EMMIE

I know, the radio

play music anyway!

Just some old white man

sent Larry off to Vietnam.

Sorry he dead.

I ain?t killed him.



CAROLINE

I?m too tired to fight.

You don?t do me right.

I can?t do with no daughters

shiftless as you.



EMMIE

Just some old white man

don?t care about the black man?



CAROLINE

Emmie Thibodeeaux! Since when you say ?black man??

You say colored or negro like you was raised up to.



EMMIE

Say he do stuff for us,

get our vote, he just ignore us,

same old story, mama, same tired old lie.

If you got to do it mama go ahead and cry.

I ain?t got no tears to shed

for no dead white guy.



RADIO

Free, free, lonesome and free!

No one pacin the floor for me.

Flower don?t need no honey bee.

If free mean misery, that?s what I be.

Ain?t nobody?s baby,

ain?t property,

got nothing I own

cept being alone

free and lonely?



CAROLINE

Go on an get yourself to bed, girl,

whoever put a mouth like that on you?

I know I didn?t do it, and God didn?t do it,

and somedays I don?t know what I?m

gonna do?



EMMIE

How your knees today?



CAROLINE

They fine, go on asleep.

Don?t wake up the baby,

say prayers for us all,

give your mama a kiss,

pologize to God for being such an unholy priss,

and a caution and a sass

fore your mama whups your?
