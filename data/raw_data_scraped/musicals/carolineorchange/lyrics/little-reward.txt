breathin? room.

Pickin pockets, countin change!

WASHING MACHINE, RADIO, AND CAROLINE

You learn to rearrange!



WASHING MACHINE

Little money to be spent,

little bit of supplement.



CAROLINE

Can?t afford embarrassment.



WASHING MACHINE, RADIO

Take it home.



CAROLINE

Money don?t buy happiness.



WASHING MACHINE, RADO

Pocket change for sayin? yes!



WASHING MACHINE

Little blessings, gone, unless

you take em home.



CAROLINE

Little bit of grace?



WASHING MACHINE

Erase that frown.

You start to let your guard down?



RADIO

All changes come from small changes

come from coin janglin in the wash machine,

knock you off your routine

ways; you rattled nowadays, in the face of

silver, shiny opportunities ?

you give in to memories?
