A Twenty Dollar Bill And Why


MR. STOPNICK

A twenty dollar bill! And why?

Upon what should we contemplate?

Allow me please to explicate:

What?s the meaning of this Gelt?



For peace sometimes, blood must be spilt.

For life, sometimes, a good man dies.

What means this money, Noah boychick?

You won?t learn this in Arithmetic!



Money follows certain laws,

it?s worth how much it?s worth because

somewhere, something?s valued less;

it?s how our blessings come, I guess.

Golden, shiny, but never pure.

Think from whence your riches stem.

Think of someone who is porr:

and know, you stole this gold from them.

Especially here in the Devil?s South!

You rip your gold from a starving man?s mouth!



ROSE

Oh for pete?s sake dad!

Give him the money!

Good!

Say thank you, honey.



NOAH

Thank you.



MR. STOPNICK

Noah!

Never forget!



GRANDMA GELLMAN

Stuart, play the clarinet!



ROSE

Right!

A happy happy Chanukah night!

What a party, what a goose!

Fun, huh? Noah?

Oh what?s the use?



DOTTY

It?s cold tonight; my feet are numb;

I?m tired waiting for a bus that won?t come.
