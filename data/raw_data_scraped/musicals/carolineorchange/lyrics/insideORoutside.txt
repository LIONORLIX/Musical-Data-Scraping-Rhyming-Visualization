Inside/Outside


NOAH

Stronger than you!



MOON

Inside, outside,

this ole world change with the tide.

Outside tears and disarray!

Inside children disobey.

Change come slow, come right away!



ROSE

From now on,

Noah darling,

a new rule:

take your money out of your pockets

before you put your pants in the hamper

or else

Caroline can keep any change that she finds.

Caroline can keep any change that she finds.

You?ve got to get it,

you?ve got to learn.

Money?s important,

a cause for concern.

No matter how much money gets left in

from now on it belongs to Caroline.

It?s hers. I?m going to tell her.

It?s hers.

You got it?

Noah?



NOAH

It?s hers.



ROSE

That?s great!

In time you?ll appreciate

how I taught you how to care:

and really, darling, I think it?s fair.

It?s not what you?re used to, but

things change.

Things change.

There?s the door!



NOAH

Things change.



MOON

Moon change.



ROSE

I wonder who?d be visiting so close to dinner?
