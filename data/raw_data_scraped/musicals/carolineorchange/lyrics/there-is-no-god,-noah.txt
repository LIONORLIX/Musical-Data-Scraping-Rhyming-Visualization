There Is No God, Noah


STUART

There is no god, Noah.

We don?t believe in God,

in all that corny stuff.

We?re scientific people!

Space is infinite and empty and cold,

people are descended from apes, actually

and usually act worse than apes,

and a boy your age should sleep without a light on,

and your mother is dead

and there is no God.
