Noah Down The Stairs


NOAH

Every day she stands between

the radio and the washing machine:

Caroline, our maid.

All day long I?ve been gone

at school. When I get home, they?re on!

Washing machine and radio!

Down the basement steps I go!

Caroline our maid!

Caroline our maid!

Caroline! Caroline! Caroline!

the President of the United States,

Caroline who?s always mad!

Caroline who runs everything!

Caroline who?s stronger than my dad!
