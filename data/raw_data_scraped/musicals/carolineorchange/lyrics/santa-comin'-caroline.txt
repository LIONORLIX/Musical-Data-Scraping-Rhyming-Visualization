Santa Comin' Caroline


RADIO

Santa comin? Caroline!

Hark the Herald Joy Divine!

Jingle bells driftin through the pine!

Way down South it don?t snow

so you know

it?s a Sign!



Loose change in the laundry

ring like Santa?s sleigh!

Should you leave ?em in the bleach cup?

(Leave ?em?)

Should you take them jinglin coins away?



Season?s greetings Caroline!

Take the change! Why you disincline?

Does it taste like a bitter wine?

Mistletoe hangin low?

Go on,

bend your spine!



Ain?t right to take his pennies.

They ain?t Santa?s sleigh.

Yeah but Christmas is expensive

(yes, it is!)

You got gifts to buy and bills to pay.



So Noel, baby, auld lang syne!

You been good, baby, toe-d the line.

Now go on, berry?s on the vine!

Jing-a-ling,

money bring

caroling?
