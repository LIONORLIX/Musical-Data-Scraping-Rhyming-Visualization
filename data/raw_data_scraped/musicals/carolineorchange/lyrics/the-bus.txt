The Bus


BUS

The earth,

the earth has bled!

Woe-singing wind down the neighborhood.

He is gone now! Gone for good!

Oh-oh-oh,

gone for good!

Deluge flood ice water rise.

Tear your hair your clothes

your eyes.

Sisters, shed

tears of blood.

The earth has bled!

Now come the flood.

Apologies for being late,

making everybody wait.

Tonight the moon illuminate

more than just

a city bus;

I am the Orphan Ship of State!

Drifting! Driverless!

Moving slow

neath my awful freight of woe.

The earth,

the earth has bled.

The President

The President is..

Oh blight November winter light

the President is dead.
