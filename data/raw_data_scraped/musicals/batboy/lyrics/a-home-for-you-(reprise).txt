A Home For You (Reprise)


BAT BOY

(Spoken)

What is it that people... say about me?



DR. PARKER

People can be very cruel.



BAT BOY

(sang)

But I'm not here to harm them,

I only want to learn,

They all walk in sunlight,

I deserve a turn.

I want to know my neighbours,

I'm not some garden gnome,

Why can't I make this world my home?



(spoken)

It's torture to sit here idly while I'm being slandered in public.

I can only imagine what they are saying.



DR. PARKER

We're not saying that you can't go out sometime, just not -



BAT BOY

(Sang)

Something was troubling me recently,

Watching the world from this table,

Reading and dreaming

And gen'rally growing mold...

But today I looked up

Just in time to see

This medical program on cable,

Astonished, I ran to the mirror and there, behold!

Look here, I've got a navel!



... It means I'm someone's child.

The doctor must have tied it

While my mother smiled...

Which means I may be human,

Complete with family tree.

And if you let me go and see,

This world may be a home for... me!
