Children, Children


PAN: Children, welcome home

To where we all began.

Alone and face to face

Let us erase the fall of man:



Let the frogs pause in their song,

Let the crickets hold their breath,

Let the trees stand still as death

And tell the mosquitoes not to bite.

Now we've been hoping for so long,

So fill the sky with fireflies.

So they can see into each other's eyes

And then they'll get it right...



Oh, Children, Children don't be scared!

The moon is up and we're all prepared!

Children, take a look around-

We're on sacred ground!

And what we thought we lost at last is found.



Now let the turtle and the dove



ANIMALS: Ooh, sha la la!



PAN: Let the lion and the lamb



ANIMALS: Ooh, sha la la! Oooh, Aaah!



PAN: Let the owl and wolf and ram embrace



ALL: Across the countryside!



PAN: Fur and feathers making love

ANIMALS: Sha la la!

PAN: Paws and claws and jaws and beaks.



ALL: Let the song go on for weeks and weeks

To bless this boy and bless this bride!



Oh, Children, Children

Don't be scared! The moon is up and we're all prepared!

Children, take a look around, hear that joyful song!

For what we thought was lost at last is found.

Sha la la la la la!

The Earth's asleep, time to wake it.

If you have clothing, forsake it.

We want you breathless and naked.

Choose your mate; And then let's see what we create!

HEY!



(Dance break with animal noises)



PAN: Draw near, my dearly beloved,

No preist, No church- but what of it?

Take root, take flight, I command it!

Here we stand-

ALL: Here we stand!

PAN: So no more stalling- take her hand!

Oh, Children, Children

ALL: Children!

PAN: Don't be scared.

ALL: Don't be scared!



PAN: The moon is up and

ALL: -We're all prepared!

Children, take a look around



PAN: We're on sacred ground, and hear that joyful sound!

For what we thought was,

ALL: What we thought was lost at last is found!

Found!

Found!

FOUND!



ALL: HEY!
