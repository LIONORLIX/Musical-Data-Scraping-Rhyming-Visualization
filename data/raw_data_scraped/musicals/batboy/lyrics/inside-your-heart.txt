Inside Your Heart


SHELLEY: It's okay. I'm still here.

Your secrets out, but don't fear.

'Cause I don't care what people say.

Once I thought you were weird;

But soon my doubts disappeared.

I think you're normaller than they.

Now you're scared; you're in need.

Clearly someone has to bleed.

I'll repay all you gave- I will give you what you crave.

Let me prove I love you; let me become part of you.

I see no better way to start!

Now I can live inside your heart.



BAT BOY: You don't know what you're saying-

SHELLEY: Yes I do-

BAT BOY: Go on, go home, forget me-

SHELLEY: It's for you-

BAT BOY: I'll hurt you, I'm not playing- Please don't!

SHELLEY: No, I knew they when I-

BOTH: Let me-

BAT BOY: No!

SHELLEY: I want to-

BOTH: Please-

SHELLEY: Yes!

BAT BOY: No! It's too bizarre!

BOTH: Just-

BAT BOY: Go!



SHELLEY: I'm not afraid! It's no disease,

it's who you are!



BAT BOY: It murders everything I touch.

A screaming fire will fill you.

You'll beg me please to kill you-

I could not let you be my crutch!

Oh, God, I feel my hunger grow-

Go! Go on, go home, forget me...



SHELLEY: No.

Such a lovely boy... look at what you've done to me,

Woke me up and set me free, so look at me.

Such a lovely boy... this way you'll be mine at last.

And I'll be fine: I heal real fast.

So look at me... Look at me!



BAT BOY: You don't know what you're saying-



SHELLEY: Shut up, that's it, I'm staying!



BOTH: I will shield you from harm

Come spend your life on my arm.

I see no better way to start.

Let me prove I love you;

Let me become part of you.

Now we shall never be apart.

I'll always live inside your heart!
