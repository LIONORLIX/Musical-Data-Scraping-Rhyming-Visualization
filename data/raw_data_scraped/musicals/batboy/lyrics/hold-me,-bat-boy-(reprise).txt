Hold Me, Bat Boy (Reprise)


SHELLEY: In a cave many miles to the south

Lived a boy born with fangs in his mouth.

He never knew what he was worth.

I could not stop his fall.

But in his precious hours on Earth, he taught us all.



MAGGIE: Love your neighbor,

RICK: Forgive,

INSTITUTE MAN: Keep your vows.



BUD AND NED: And a mountain's no place to raise cows.



SHERIFF: Revenge is something God forbids,

BUD: To scapegoat folk's is wrong,

MRS.TAYLOR'S KIDS: And don't kill Mrs.Taylor's kids.



MEREDITH: Let go the fears to which you cling,

ADD DR.PARKER: And through your tears you'll hear him sing,

ADD SHELLEY: Lift up your ears and join his song!



ADD TOWNFOLK: And join his song! And join his song!

And join his song!



ALL: Aaaaah!

Hold your Bat Boy, Touch your Bat Boy

No more need to hide!

Know your Bat Boy, Love your Bat Boy

Don't deny your beast inside!

Ah, ah- Aaaaaa! Aaaaa! Aaaaaaaaaaah!
