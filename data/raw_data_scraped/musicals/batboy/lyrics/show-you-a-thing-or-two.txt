We were just watching Masterpeice Theatre on PBS.

BAT BOY: How do you do?

SHELLEY: Lovely, and you?

BAT BOY: Lovely, and you?

SHELLEY: Won't you sit down?

BAT BOY: Won't you sit down?

SHELLEY: Don't mind if I do.

BAT BOY: Don't mind if I do.

SHELLEY: The weather would be perfect if it weren't quite so hot.

BAT BOY: Hot.

MEREDITH: I fear we're out of sandwiches, that butler should be shot.

BAT BOY: Bow deep, kiss hand, pull chair, look bland.

Pour the tea, pass the jam

MEREDITH: Are we clear?

BAT BOY: Yes, ma'am!



(Bat Boy spills the tea and all dishes go flying. He panics.

Meredith calms him.)



MEREDITH: I'll show you a thing or two. Don't cry, it's okay, dear.

Rome's not built in a day, dear.

BAT BOY: Hah?

MEREDITH: A bit more schooling, a lot less drooling.

Let me talk to him over here for a moment!

I'll show you a thing or two. Sure, kid, you feel weary.

Head's all fuzzy and bleary.

I know you're leery. But here's my theory.

Keep sluggin'- that's how it's done.

Soon you're bound to break through!

And whaddaya know, you may-

SHELLEY:

Mom, Edgar just finished his essay for his high school equivalency exam!



BAT BOY: I will discuss Copernicus who ruined all our fun,

And showed we're just a ball of dust that limps around the sun.

Which brings me then to Darwin, when he bent us out of shape

As he began to prove that man is nephew to an ape.

We were annoyed when Doctor Freud declared it's not a soul,

It is your blind subconsious mind that's always in control.

But I submit that any twit if he had eyes to see,

Can seize his fate; self-educate; and turn out just like me!



(All Cheer)



ALL: Shirts, shoes, pants, vest.

Can't go out there underdressed.

Collar pressed, look your best.

And won't they be impressed! 'Cause:



I'll/He'll show 'em a thing or two!

I was dirty and rowdy (rowdy)

Even dressed a bit dowdy (dowdy)

But now say:



OTHERS: Howdy!



ALL: To a summa cum laude!

I'll/He'll show 'em the way it's done!

But no applause I'm/He's not through!



BAT BOY: I'm gonna Vince Van Gogh'em

BAT BOY: And Edgar Allen Poe'em

BAT BOY: So buddy I'm going to-
