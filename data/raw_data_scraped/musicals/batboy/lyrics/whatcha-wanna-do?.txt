Rick:

Your dad's just gonna kill it right?



Shelly:

Iiiunno...So...whatcha wanna do tonight?



Rick:

Hey you little freak you remember me?

We were never introduced properly.

Hey you gonna cry?

You don't look so tough by the light of day.

But we ain't gonna murder you right away

First we're gonna buy you lots of fancy clothes

Make you clip your toes

Watch you walk around in make up and panty hose



Shelly:

We're gonna take you back

Out by the railroad track



Both:

And leave your body for the dogs as a midnight snack



Rick:

Your poppa was a pig



Shelly:

Your momma was a snake



Rick:

We're gonna snap you like a twig and dump you in the lake



Shelly:

We're gonna chain your arm

To an atomic bomb

and make you take your granmama to the senior prom

(she starts beat boxing and then panting...Rick stops her)

Whaa?



Rick:
