Ugly Boy


SHELLEY:

Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! shutupshutupshutupshutup!

Such an ugly boy...



MEREDITH: He's just different.



SHELLEY: Like a stinky bony rat.



MEREDITH: Well, you wanted to keep him.



SHELLEY: I didn't know he'd look like that!



MEREDITH: Shelley!



SHELLEY: Well, look at him!

(Thunder clap)



MEREDITH: Oh my, its going to be quite a storm.



SHELLEY: Stupid starving freak.



MEREDITH: Shelley, that's not nice.



SHELLEY: Doesn't have the sense to eat.



MEREDITH: We just haven't figured out what he needs.



SHELLEY: Dropping dead right at my feet.



MEREDITH: Shelley!



SHELLEY: Just look at him...



MEREDITH: He's just... tired.



SHELLEY: That's my mom. See, she cries ev'ry time a stray dog dies.



MEREDITH: Well, I feel bad for them.



SHELLEY: No one calls.

MEREDITH: Sure they call...

SHELLEY: No one claims.

MEREDITH: Sometimes...

SHELLEY: So we put them down and never learn their names...



MEREDITH: Well, we can name him, sweetheart. What would you like to call him?



SHELLEY: BAT BOY.



MEREDITH: Or maybe... Edgar. (calls to him) Ed-gar!



BATBOY- (looks at her) Gggnnnnnnwwgwooo?



MEREDITH: Look! He likes that name! Edgar it is!



SHELLEY: Such an ugly boy.



MEREDITH: I'll try to make him something to eat.



SHELLEY: Guess we can't just turn him loose.



MEREDITH: Stay away from the cage.



SHELLEY: I'm afraid he'll reproduce.
