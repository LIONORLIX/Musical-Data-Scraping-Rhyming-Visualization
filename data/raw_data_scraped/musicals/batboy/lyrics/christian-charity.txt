Christian Charity


SHERIFF: Evening folks!

SHELLEY: Whatcha got?

SHERIFF: Doctor home?

MEREDITH: No, he's not.

SHERIFF: Wen's he back?

MEREDITH: An hour or so.

SHELLEY: The heck is that?

SHERIFF: Well, I don't know.



MEREDITH: What in the world?

SHELLEY: Where did you find?

MEREDITH: What is he doing?

SHELLEY: He's out of his mind!

MEREDITH: Is he in pain?

SHELLEY: Is he insane?

SHERIFF: Maybe and possibly, let me explain.

(Sheriff knocks Bat Boy down with his pistol.)



MEREDITH AND SHELLEY: No!



SHERIFF: Aw, heck. Maybe I shouldn'tve done that.

But that boy was hoppin' like a scalded dog.



MEREDITH: Boy?



SHERIFF: Maybe. Frankly, that's why I'm here.

I figure maybe we need a veterinarian to sort this out.

I'm hoping Dr.Parker will know what to do.

I didn't know where else to take him...



SHELLEY: Mom!

MEREDITH: Shelley, quiet!



SHERIFF: Can't go to jail, he's underage.



SHELLEY: Mom!

MEREDITH: Shelley, quiet!



SHERIFF:

Folks up at the Med School, bet they'd carve him up or bake him.

I'd send the FBI a page, but I don't think we're at that stage-

So, here he is folks, he's all yours.

Couldn't leave him out of doors, creepin' on all fours.

We could always shoot him but that don't seem right to me.

'N I can't rid myself o' my Christian Charity.



SHELLEY: Can we see him?

MEREDITH: Shelley- get away!

SHERIFF: You listen to your mother, Shelley.

You don't want to be near if it wakes up.

It bit one of the Taylor kids.



MEREDITH: Shelley, don't stare- Shelley, don't poke.

What is this, sheriff, some kind of sick joke?



SHELLEY: Mom, he's so gross! Mom, can he stay?



SHERIFF: Shel, I was hopin' you'd see it that way.

I'm comin' up for re-election.



SHELLEY: Mom!

MEREDITH: Shelley, quiet!



SHERIFF: I gotta bring this thing to heel.



SHELLEY: Mom!

MEREDITH: Shelley, quiet!



SHERIFF: A boy with his complextion's gonna meet with some objections,

'N I think I know how folks will feel once they hear this "Bat Child" is for real.



SHELLEY: It's a bat child? MOM! We gotta keep it!



MEREDITH:

All right, sheriff. Dr. Parker has some cages. I'll take care of the boy for you.



SHERIFF: Ah, that's great, Meredith. I can't thank you enough for the favor.

And if he turns into a pain, call me, I've got stun guns and a chain.

SHELLEY: WHOA!

MEREDITH: OH!



SHERIFF: (overlapping) So here he is folks, he's all yours.

I couldn't leave him out of doors, creeping on all fours.

We may have to put him down-



MEREDITH: (overlapping) Don't stare, Shelley- please don't poke.

Don't touch him, Shelley, don't provoke.



SHELLEY: (overlapping) Mom! Look at him! I know but Mom...

Look at him! What's wrong with him?



ALL: For now we'll wait and see!



SHERIFF AND MEREDITH: We can't rid ourselves of our Christian Charity.



SHERIFF: (overlapping) So, here he is folks, he's all yours.

Couldn't leave him out of doors, creeping on all fours.

Those thunderclouds are closing in-



MEREDITH: (overlapping) Don't stare, Shelley, please don't poke.

Don't touch him, Shelley, don't provoke!



SHELLEY: (overlapping) MOOOOOOOOOOMMM!

MOOOOOOOOOOOMMMMM!



ALL: We can't just let him be.

We can't rid ourselves of our Christian Charity.

We can't rid ourselves of our Christian Charity.



SHELLEY: Mom!

MEREDITH: Shelley, quiet!
