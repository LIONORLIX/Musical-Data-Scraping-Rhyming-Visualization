Comfort And Joy


DR.PARKER: You little creep, you're gonna pay.

I won't be shoved out of the way! Oh no-

VOICES IN HIS HEAD: Oh no!

DR.PARKER: Oh no-

VOICES IN HIS HEAD: Oh no!

DR.PARKER: And I could make a solid case

For smashing in your filthy face.

VOICES IN HIS HEAD: Kill him!

DR.PARKER: Shut up!

VOICES IN HIS HEAD: Kill him!

DR.PARKER: Shut up! I've got a spade and a burlap sack!

VOICES IN HIS HEAD: Kill him now!

DR.PARKER: And there's a hole in the yard out back!

VOICES IN HIS HEAD: Kill him now!

DR.PARKER: So I've got one thing to do before you die!

VOICES IN HIS HEAD: Now! Now!



DR.PARKER: WAIT!

She will see what you are,

I will win back my bride

She herself will decide

To get rid of the boy!

She'll admit she was wrong,

She'll return before long

She'll be singing a song

Full of comfort and joy.



VOICES: Comfort and joy- Comfort and joy!

DR.PARKER: Comfort and joy!

VOICES: Comfort and joy- Comfort and joy!

Kill the Bat Boy- Kill the Bat Boy!



MEREDITH: Oh, Honey, I apologize: You've really opened up my eyes.

SHELLEY: No way!

MEREDITH: Yes way!

SHELLEY: No way!

MEREDITH: Yes way! I'm laying out your Sunday best

Now brush your teeth and get some rest. All right?

SHELLEY: No way?

MEREDITH: All right!

SHELLEY? All right!



MEREDITH: Now when they see him they'll make a fuss.

SHELLEY: Is that true?

MEREDITH: We gotta smile like we just don't care!

SHELLEY: That's not fair!

MEREDITH: They put their pants on the same as us!

SHELLEY: Yes they do...

MEREDITH: So just imagine them in their underwear!

SHELLEY: And then this time I swear...



BOTH: He will show that he's not

What they're terrified of.

He will show them a love

They can never destroy!

If we prove that they're wrong

They'll come round before long

And we'll all sing a song

Full of comfort and joy!



CHORUS: Comfort and joy! Yeah! Comfort and joy!



MEREDITH AND SHELLEY: Comfort and Joy!



CHORUS: Comfort and Joy! Comfort and Joy!

DR.PARKER: Stop the Bat Boy!



(Town enters with hubbub)



SHERIFF: Settle down, people!

We want to make sure the revival goes off without a hitch,

so let's go over the schedule.

Listen up: From nine to twelve he does the healing...



NED: Sheriff...

MAGGIE: You hush up!



SHERIFF: At noon he'll bless the fields and plows...



MR.DILLON: Tractors too?

MAGGIE: Hush up!



SHERIFF: Then lunch is from one thirty-



NED: Sheriff, what about my Gertie!

MAGGIE: Hush!



SHERIFF: Well as it seems that time allows, three to ten:

The Blessing Of The Cows!



ALL: Yes! The Blessing Of The Cows!

Boy, that preachers a pro!

Gives a heckuva show!

LORRAINE: Just like Seigfried and Roy!



ALL: He'll bring comfort and joy!

So if nothing goes wrong,

Yes, if nothing goes wrong,

Lord, if nothing goes wrong,

We'll have comfort and...

Comfort and Joy!

Comfort and Joy!

Lord, we need some comfort and joy!

Any means you'd care to employ,

Won't you send us comfort and joy!



BAT BOY: Dear God: I'm still not sure how people pray.

Or what one does with one's hands. But please, my thirst grows every day.

I feel it burn in my glands.

Please won't you change the way I am, or prove I'm human underneath.

Or if you just don't give a damn-

(points to fangs) You could at leatht get rid of theethe!



If I can't prove them wrong, show me where I belong,

for a hunger so strong kills all comfort and joy.

If you'd make me complete. I'll avoid all red meat,

I'll eat nothing but soy to have comfort and joy...



DR.PARKER: By next week you'll be gone, six feet under my lawn.

I'll have nobody toy with my comfort and joy...



MEREDITH/SHELLEY: He will come out a champ.

It's just like summer camp. They'll get used to the boy,

He'll bring comfort and joy...



TOWNSFOLK: Lord, please give us your word.

Cure the plague on the herd.

We don't mean to annoy but send comfort and joy...



BAT BOY: Comfort and joy! Comfort and joy!

DR.PARKER: Stop the Bat Boy! Stop the Bat Boy!



ALL: Comfort and joy! Comfort and JOY!



(Lights up on Hospital room)



RUTHIE: Dr.Parker, what are you doing here?



DR.PARKER: Don't worry, Ruthie.

The Bat Boy will pay for what he's done to you.

We're all going to miss you very much.



(Dr.Parker injects Ruthie and she dies.)



ALL: AAHHHHH!
