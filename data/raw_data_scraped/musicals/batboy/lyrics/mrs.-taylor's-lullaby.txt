Mrs. Taylor's Lullaby


RUTHIE: Monster! Monster!

MRS.TAYLOR: Hush, baby.

RUTHIE: Bat monster! Bat monster! Bat monster!



MRS. TAYLOR: Sleep little Ruthie baby no one's gonna hurt you,

Sheriff's gonna have that little freak destroyed,

Or if he's a coward and he won't protect my children,

mama's gonna get the sheriff unemployed.

Sleep little Ruthie baby don't you fear no Bat Boy,

Mama's gonna hunt him down and bring him here.

Then you can skin him and wear him as a jacket,

and we'll string a necklace with a dried bat ear.
