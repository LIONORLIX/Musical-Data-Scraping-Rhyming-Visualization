Money Isn't Everything


Money isn't everything~

What can money buy?

An automobile, so you won't get wet;

Champagne, so you won't get dry.

Money isn't everything~

What have rich folks got?

A Florida home, so you won't get cold;

A yacht so you won't get hot;

An orchid or two,

So you won't feel blue

If you have to go out at night;

And maybe a jar

Of caviar,

So your appetite won't be light.

Oil tycoon and cattle king,

Radio troubadour,

Belittle the fun that their fortunes bring

And tell you that they are sure

Money isn't everything!



Money isn't everything,

Money isn't everything

Unless you're very poor!



Can money make you honest?

Can it teach you right from wrong?

Can money keep you healthy?

Can it make your muscles strong?

Can money make your eyes get red,

The way they get from sewing?

Can money make your back get sore,

The way it gets from mowing?

Can money make your hands get rough,

As washing dishes does?

Can money make you smell the way

That cooking fishes does?

It may buy you gems and fancy clothes

And juicy steaks to carve,

But it cannot build your character

Or teach you how to starve!



Money isn't everything~

If you're rich, you pay

Elizabeth Arden to do your face

The night you attend a play.

Feeling like the bloom of spring,

Down the aisle you float,

A Tiffany ring, and a Cartier string

Of pearls to adorn your throat.

Your Carnegie dress

Will be more or less

Of a handkerchief round your hip,

Sewed on to you so

That your slip won't show~

And whatever you show won't slip.

To your creamy shoulders cling

Ermines white as snow.

Then on to cafe's where they sway and swing,

You go with your wealthy beau.

There you'll hear a crooner sing:

"Money isn't everything!"



Money isn't everything,

As long as you have dough!
