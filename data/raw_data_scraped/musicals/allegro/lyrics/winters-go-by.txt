Winters Go By


The winters go by,

The summers fly,

And soon you're a student in "High"!

And now your clothes are spotlessly clean,

Your head is anointed with brilliantine. . .

You're brimming with hope

But can't quite cope

With problems that vex and perplex,

For you don't quite know how to treat

The bewild'ringly opposite sex.



What do you suppose Jenny would do if you kissed her?

Jenny is so innocent, so frail!

You could crush her in your strong, manly arms. . .

But that wouldn't be right.

Besides she might get sore~

Might yell, and wake up her old man!



(Poor Joe!

The older you grow,

The harder it is to know

What to think,

What to do,

Where to go!)



Heigh-ho!  It would be nice. . .

Think about it as you walk home.

Make believe you did it,

And make out she wasn't mad

When you kissed her.

Gee, wouldn't it be wonderful

If girls liked it too!
