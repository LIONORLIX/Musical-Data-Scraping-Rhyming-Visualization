Allegro


Our world is for the forceful

And not for sentimental folk,

But brilliant and resourceful

And paranoiac gentle folk.

(Not soft and sentimental folk!)



"Allegro," a musician

Would so describe the speed of it,

The clash and competition

Of counterpoint.

(The need of it?

We cannot prove the need of it.)



We know no other way

Of living out a day.

Our music must be galloping and gay.

We muffle all the undertones,

The minor blood-and-thunder tones;

The overtones are all we care to play.

Hysterically frantic,

We are stubbornly romantic

And doggedly determined to be gay!



Brisk, lively,

Merry and bright~

Allegro!

Same tempo

Morning and night~

Allegro!

Don't stop, whatever you do,

Do something dizzy and new,

Keep up the hullabaloo!

Allegro!  Allegro!  Allegro!  Allegro!  Allegro!



We spin and we spin and we spin and we spin,

Playing a game no one can win.

The men who corner wheat,

The men who corner gin,

The men who rule the air waves,

The denizens of din~

They spin and they spin,

They spin and they spin.

The girls who dig for gold

And won't give in for tin,

The lilies of the field,

So femininely thin,

They toil not, they toil not,

But oh, how they spin!

Oh, how they spin!

Oh, how they spin!



May's in love with Kay's husband,

He's in love with Sue.

Sue's in love with May's husband,

What are they to do?

Tom's in love with Tim's wife,

She's in love with Sam.

Sam's in love with Tom's wife,

So they're in a jam.



They are smart little sheep

Who have lost their way,

Blah!  Blah!  Blah!



Brisk, lively,

Merry and bright~

Allegro!

Same tempo

Morning and night~

Allegro!

Don't stop, whatever you do,

Do something dizzy and new,

Keep up the hullabaloo!

Allegro!  Allegro!  Allegro!  Allegro!  Allegro!
