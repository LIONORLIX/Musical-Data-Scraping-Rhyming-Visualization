You Are Never Away


You are never away from your home in my heart;

There is never a day when you don't play a part

In a word that I say, or a sight that I see.



You are never away and I'll never be free.

You're the smile on my face, or a song that I sing;

You're a rainbow I chase on a morning in Spring;

You're a star in the lace of a wild willow tree,

In the green leafy lace of a wild willow tree.



But tonight you're no star, nor a song that I sing.

In my arms where you are, you are sweeter than Spring;

In my arms where you are clinging closely to me,

You are lovelier by far, than I dreamed you could be.



You are lovelier, my darling than I dreamed you could be!
