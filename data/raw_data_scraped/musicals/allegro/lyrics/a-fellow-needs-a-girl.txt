A Fellow Needs a Girl


A fellow needs a girl to sit by his side at the end ot a weary day,

To sit by his side and listen to him talk and agree with the things he'll say

A fellow needs a girl to hold in his arms when the rest of his world goes wrong,

To hold in his armsand know that she believes that her fellow is wise and strong.

When things go right and his job's well done, he wants to share the prize he's won.

If no one shares and no one cares,

Where's the fun ot a job well done?

Or a prize you've won?

A fellow needs a home, his own kind of home,

But to make this dream come true.

A fellow needs a girl, his own kind of girl.

My kind of girl is you.
