Ya-ta-ta


Yatata, yatata, yatata, yatata,

Yatata, yatata, yatata, yatata,



Busy!

Busy!

I'm busy as a bee!

I start the day at half-past one.

When I am finished phoning

It's time to dress for tea.

Nothing I have to do gets done!



(The deep-thinking gentlemen and ladies

Who keep a metropolis alive

Drink cocktails

And knock tails

Ev'ry afternoon at five.)



Yatata, yatata, yatata, yatata,

Yatata, yatata, yatata, yatata,



Doctor,

Doctor,

I need another shot!

(The shots he gives are too divine!

He fills a little needle and he gives you all it's got.

Your fanny hurts, but you feel fine.)



Broccoli, Hogwah, Balderdash,

Phoney, Baloney, Tripe, and Trash!

Goodness knows where the day has gone!

The years of a life are quickly gone,

But the talk, talk, talk goes on and on

And on and on and on~

The prattle and the tattle,

The gab and the gush,

The chatter and the patter,

And the twaddle and the tush

Go on and on and on and on and on.
