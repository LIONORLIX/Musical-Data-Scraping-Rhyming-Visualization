Gary, Indiana


Harold:

Gary, Indiana!

What a wonderful name,

Named for Elbert Gary of judiciary fame.

Gary, Indiana, as a Shakespeare would say,

Trips along softly on the tongue this way--

Gary, Indiana, Gary Indiana, Gary, Indiana,

Let me say it once again.

Gary, Indiana, Gary, Indiana, Gary, Indiana,

That's the town that "knew me when."

If you'd like to have a logical explanation

How I happened on this elegant syncopation,

I will say without a moment of hesitation

There is just one place

That can light my face.

Gary, Indiana,

Gary Indiana,

Not Louisiana, Paris, France, New York, or Rome, but--

Gary, Indiana,

Gary, Indiana,

Gary Indiana,

My home sweet home.
