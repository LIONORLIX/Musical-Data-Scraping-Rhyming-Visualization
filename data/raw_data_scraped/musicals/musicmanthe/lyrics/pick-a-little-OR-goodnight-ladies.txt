Pick-A-Little / Goodnight Ladies


Alma:

Pick a little, talk a little, pick a little, talk a little,

cheep cheep cheep, talk a lot, pick a little more



Alma and Ethel:

Pick a little, talk a little, pick a little,

talk a little, cheep cheep cheep, talk a lot, pick a little more



All the ladies:

Pick a little, talk a little, pick a little,

talk a little, cheep cheep cheep, talk a lot, pick a little more



Maud:

Professor, her kind of woman doesn't belong on any committee.

Of course, I shouldn't tell you this but she advocates dirty books.



Harold:

Dirty books?!



Alma:

Chaucer



Ethel:

Rabelais



Eulalie:

Balzac!



Maud:

And the worst thing

Of course, I shouldn't tell you this but-



Alma:

I'll tell.



Ethel:

The man lived on my street, let me tell.



Eulalie:

Stop! I'll tell.

She made brazen overtures to a man who never

had a friend in this town till she came here.



Alma:

Oh, yes

That woman made brazen overtures

With a gilt-edged guarantee

She had a golden glint in her eye

And a silver voice with a counterfeit ring



Just melt her down and you'll reveal

A lump of lead as cold as steel

Here, where a woman's heart should be!



Eulalie, Ethel, Maud, Alma, Mrs Squires:

He left River City the Library building

But he left all the books to her



Alma:

Chaucer



Ethel:

Rabelais



Eulalie:

Bal-zac!



Ladies:

Pick a little, talk a little, pick a little, talk a little,

cheep cheep cheep, talk a lot, pick a little more

Pick a little, talk a little, pick a little, talk a little,

cheep cheep cheep, talk a lot, pick a little more

Pick a little, talk a little, pick a little, talk a little,

Cheep cheep cheep cheep cheep cheep cheep cheep

Cheep cheep cheep cheep cheep cheep cheep cheep

Cheep cheep cheep cheep cheep cheep cheep cheep

Pick a little, talk a little, cheep!
