Will I Ever Tell You


Marian:

Dream of now, dream of then.

Dream of a love song that might have been.

Do I love you?

Oh, yes, I love you.

And I'll bravely tell you

But only when we dream again.

Sweet and low, sweet and low,

How sweet that mem'ry how long ago

Forever?

Oh, yes forever.

Will I ever tell you?

Ah-- no.
