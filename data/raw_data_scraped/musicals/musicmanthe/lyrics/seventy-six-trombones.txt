Seventy Six Trombones


Harold:

Seventy-six trombones led the big parade

With a hundred and ten cornets close at hand.

They were followed by rows and rows of the finest virtuo-

Sos, the cream of ev'ry famous band.



Seventy-six trombones caught the morning sun

With a hundred and ten cornets right behind

There were more than a thousand reeds

Springing up like weeds

There were horns of ev'ry shape and kind.



There were copper bottom tympani in horse platoons

Thundering, thundering all along the way.

Double bell euphoniums and big bassoons,

Each bassoon having it's big, fat say!



There were fifty mounted cannon in the battery

Thundering, thundering louder than before

Clarinets of ev'ry size

And trumpeters who'd improvise

A full octave higher than the score!
