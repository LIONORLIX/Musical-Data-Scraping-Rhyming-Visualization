It's You


Quartet:

It's you in the sunrise, it's you in my cup.

It's you all the way into town.

It's your sweet "Hello, dear" that sets me up

And it's your "Got to go, dear" that gets me down.

It's you on my pillow in all my dreams.

'Til once more the morning breaks through

What words could be saner or truer or plainer

Than it's you, it's you.

Yes, it's you.

Oh, yes it's you.
