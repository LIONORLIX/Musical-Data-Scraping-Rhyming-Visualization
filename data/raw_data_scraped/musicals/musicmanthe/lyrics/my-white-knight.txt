My White Knight


(Marian)

My white knight, not a Lancelot, nor an angel with wings

Just someone to love me, who is not ashamed of a few nice things.

My white knight who knew what my heart would say if it only knew how.

Please, dear Venus, show me now.



All I want is a plain man

All I want is a modest man

A quiet man, a gentle man

A straightforward and honest man

To sit with me in a cottage somewhere in the state of Iowa.



And I would like him to be more interested in me than he is in himself.

And more interested in us than in me.



And if occasionally he'd ponder

what make Shakespeare and Beethoven great,

Him I could love till I die. Him I could love till I die.



My white knight, not a Lancelot, nor an angel with wings.

Just someone to love me, who is not ashamed of a few nice things.

My white knight, let me walk with him where others ride by

Walk and love him till I die, till I die.
