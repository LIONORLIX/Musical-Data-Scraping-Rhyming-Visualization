Lida Rose


Quartet:

Lida Rose, I'm home again, Rose

To get the sun back in the sky.

Lida Rose, I'm home again, Rose

About a thousand kisses shy.

Ding dong ding

I can hear the chapel bell chime.

Ding dong ding

At the least suggestion I'll pop the question.

Lida Rose, I'm home again, Rose

Without a sweetheart to my name.

Lida Rose, now everyone knows

That I am hoping you're the same

So here is my love song, not fancy or fine

Lida Rose, oh won't you be mine

Lida Rose, oh Lida Rose oh Lida Rose.
