Till There Was You


Marian:

There were bells on the hill

But I never heard them ringing,

No, I never heard them at all

Till there was you.



There were birds in the sky

But I never saw them winging

No, I never saw them at all

Till there was you.



And there was music,

And there were wonderful roses,

They tell me,

In sweet fragrant meadows of dawn, and dew.



There was love all around

But I never heard it singing

No, I never heard it at all

Till there was you!
