Maison des Lunes


Gaston:

When a man like me is thwarted

And denied his honeymoon

LeFou:

When the pretty thing he?s courted

Refuses to swoon

Gaston:

Then the time has come for a murky plan

LeFou:

For which he turns to a murky man

Gaston:

To find that fiend

All:

Where better than

At the Maison des Lunes?

Gaston:

You?ll be strapping up an inmate

LeFou:

Very tightly

Gaston:

Very soon

Gaston/LeFou:

But we won?t bring him in late

LeFou:

Your check in time?s noon

D?Arque:

How sad Maurice is not too well

Gaston:

Prepare a five star padded cell

All:

And book him in

For a long, long spell

At the Maison des Lunes

Gaston:

Do I make myself entirely clear?

LeFou:

It?s the simplest deal of your whole foul career

Gaston:

Put Maurice away and she?ll be here in moments

LeFou:

In a dreadful state

Gaston:

She?ll capitulate to me!

D?Arque:

Oh, oh, oh!

I love incarceration

I could lock up a platoon

Gaston/LeFou:

Well apply your inclination

To a mad old buffoon

Then wave one bachelor goodbye

Gaston:

She?ll be my bride!

LeFou:

She?d rather die!

Than have her daddy ossify?

D?Arque:

The time?s opportune

All:

So book the church

Raise glasses high

To the Maison des Lunes
