No Matter What (Reprise)


Maurice:

First prize is nearly mine

It's quite my best invention

So simple, yet complex; So massive, yet so small

This triumph of design

Will be my old-age pension

That is, provided I can find the fair at all

I must have missed a sign...

I should have paid attention...Drat!

(Wolf howls)

That's not a nightingale, and not a mating call.

Wolves!
