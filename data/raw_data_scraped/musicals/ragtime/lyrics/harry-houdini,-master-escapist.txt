Harry Houdini, Master Escapist


THE LITTLE BOY

Harry Houdini,

master escapist,

master of getting free...



HOUDINI

Holding his breath

He dances with death

As daring as he can be...

Enter the master

Saved from disaster

Making the people gape



(Explosion, audience cheering and clapping)



THE LITTLE BOY

Mother! Mother!



MOTHER

Edgar, what is it? What are you doing out of bed?

Shhh. You just had a nightmare.



THE LITTLE BOY

Something terrible is going to happen!

An explosion. People are going to die.
