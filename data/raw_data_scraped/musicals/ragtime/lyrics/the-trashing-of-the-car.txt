The Trashing of the Car


CONKLIN

Running away, nigger?



COALHOUSE

I am going to find a policeman.

If anyone touches my car before I return, he will answer to Coalhouse.



CONKLIN

Tell him Fire Chief Will Conklin sends his regards!



BOOKER T. WASHINGTON

We must exhibit patience.

Self-control. Forbearance. And dwell above hatred and acts of cruelty.



CONKLIN

Come on, fellas, let's roll her into the pond and see if she floats!



SARAH

Come on, Coalhouse. Come on. It doesn't matter.
