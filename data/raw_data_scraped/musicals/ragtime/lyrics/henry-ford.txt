Henry Ford


FORD:

See my people?

Well, here's my theory

Of what this country

Is moving toward.

Every worker

A cog in motion.

Well, that's the notion of

Henry Ford!



One man tightens

And one man ratchets

And one man reaches

To pull one cord.

Car keeps moving

In one direction.



ENSEMBLE:

A genuflection to

Henry Ford!

Hallelujah!

Praise the maker

Of the Model T!



FORD:

Speed up the belt.

Speed up the belt, Sam.



ENSEMBLE:

Hallelujah!



COALHOUSE:

Hell, I'll take her!



ENSEMBLE:

Sure amazin'

How far some fellas can see!



FORD:

Speed up the belt.

Speed up the belt, Sam.

Speed up the belt.

Speed up the belt, Sam!



ENSEMBLE & FORD:

Speed up the, speed up the, speed up the speed up the belt!



ENSEMBLE:

Mass production

Will sweep the nation.

A simple notion,

The world's reward.



FORD:

Even people who ain't too clever

Can learn to tighten a nut forever,

Attach one pedal

Or pull one lever



ENSEMBLE:

For Henry Ford!

Henry Ford!

Henry Ford!

Henry Ford!



FORD:

Grab yor goggles



ENSEMBLE & FORD:

And climb aboard!



COALHOUSE:

I'm ready, Lord!
