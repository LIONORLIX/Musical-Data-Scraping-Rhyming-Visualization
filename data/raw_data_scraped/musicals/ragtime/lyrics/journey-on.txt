Journey On


FATHER:

It's an honor to go on an expedition with you,

Admiral Peary. It's men like you who've made this

country great.



ADMIRAL PEARY:

It's men like you who'll keep it great.



HENSON:

All sails set, Admiral.



PEARY:

Thank you, Mr. Henson. This is my First Officer, Mr.

Matthew Henson.



FATHER:

Good evening.



HENSON:

Welcome aboard.



FATHER:

What's that? In the distance? Such a ghostly glow.



PEARY:

They're called rag ships. Immigrants from every cesspool

in Western and Eastern Europe. Most of them become very

Patriotic Americans. They're your future customers.



HENSON:

My people were also brought here on ships.



PEARY:

Good watch, Henson.



FATHER:

You're a brave man, whoever you are. Coming so far,

expecting so much.



A salute to the man

On the deck of that ship!

A salute to the immigrant stranger.

Heaven knows why you's make

Such a terrible trip.

May your own god protect you from danger.

Is it freedom or love

That you pray for

In you guttural accent?

Too late, long gone.

A salute to a fellow

Who hasn't a chance.

Journey on.



TATEH:

If people ask, how old are you?



LITTLE GIRL:

I don't answer.



TATEH:

Your name?



LITTLE GIRL:

No name.



TATEH:

Where your mother is?



LITTLE GIRL:

Dead.



TATEH:

This is my father. He speaks fo both of us.



LITTLE GIRL:

This is my father. He speaks for both of us.

Is that other ship going back home?



TATEH:

No, no. America is our home now.

America is our shtetl.



TATEH & LITTLE GIRL:

Amekhaye khlebn.



LITTLE GIRL:

Look. Someone is waving. Where is he going?



TATEH:

He's a fool on a fool's journey.



You depart on a ship

From a country like this.

Why on earth would you want to

Be leaving?

was it something you lost

That you suddenly miss?

Are you angry,

Or possibly

Grieving?

Do you see in my face

What you've lost, sir?

Are you moved by the death ship

We sail upon?

Well, perhaps you're a man

Who's in search of his heart.

Journey on.



FATHER:

Journey on.



BOTH:

Two ships passing

In the kinship

Of the darkness-



FATHER:

One going from-



TATEH:

One coming to-



BOTH:

America



Two men meeting

At the moment

Of a journey.

For a moment,

In the darkness,

We're the same...



MOTHER:

And what of the people

Whose boundaries chafe,



FATHER:

I salute you,

My friend



MOTHER:

Who marry so bravely

And end up so safe?



TATEH:

May you

Find what

You need



MOTHER:

I will be journeyin

Here, my love,

As you go



FATHER:

As you go



TATEH:

As you go



MOTHER:

Journeying



FATHER:

Journeying



TATEH:

Journeying



MOTHER:

On the sea.



FATHER:

On the sea



TATEH:

On the sea.



ALL THREE:

We're two ships passing

At a distance,

Through the darkness,



FATHER:

One going from...



MOTHER & TATEH:

One coming to...



ALL THREE:

...America.



Strangers sharing

The beginnings

Of a journey



FATHER:

I salute you!



TATEH:

God be with you!



MOTHER:

I will miss you...



ALL THREE:

In the Darkness

Of the dawn-

Journey on!
