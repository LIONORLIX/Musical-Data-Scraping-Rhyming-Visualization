Justice


COALHOUSE

We'll see justice, Sarah

And plenty of men

Who will stand up and give us our due!



TOWN HALL BUREAUCRAT

Well, you can sign another complaint, Mr.

Walker, but volunteer firemen are not municipal employees, and

therefore do not come under the jurisdiction of the city. I'm sorry.



SECOND BUREAUCRAT

I'm still tracing your first complaint, Mr. Walker.

Are you sure you filed it with this office. Let me look again.



COALHOUSE

Justice, Sarah.

This is America.



MOTHER

I am ashamed that our community is represented in his mind by that bunch of toughs.



FATHER

Let me talk to my lawyer.



YOUNGER BROTHER

That's all it will be: talk, talk, talk!



COALHOUSE

The law's the law.

The law's been broken

Why should I turn the other cheek?

What about justice!



PEOPLE OF HARLEM

The bureaucrats and bunglers

The attorneys who smiled



WHITE ATTORNEY

My advice is recover your car and forget the whole matter.



PEOPLE OF HARLEM

The clerks and the officials

And the forms that were filed



CLERK

This is to get a place on the court calendar. This for change of venue...



PEOPLE OF HARLEM

So many roads to justice

Around the bend



BLACK LAWYER

I want justice for our people so bad I can taste it.

But I won't waste my time on a mere case of vandalism

when I have real injustices to take to the courts.



PEOPLE OF HARLEM

And every road a new dead end!



COALHOUSE

I will not move

>From where I'm standing

Till what's mine is restored to me

I'm not some fool

I'm not their nigger!

I will have what's fairly owed me!

And till then, I will not marry...



MOTHER

We understand Mr. Walker's outrage. We share it. All decent people do.



SARAH

He said, "Wheels are turning for us, girl."



MOTHER

But I'm sure there's some way to settle this affair without calling off the wedding.



SARAH

He said, "Times are starting to roll."



MOTHER

To be so close to the happiness you both deserve and have it come to this!



SARAH

Well, I know he'll get where he wants to

'Cause he's got that fire in his soul

Said, "There's justice, Sarah,

And plenty of men who will stand up and give us our due."

Well, you'll have your due, Coalhouse,

Yes, you'll have your due.
