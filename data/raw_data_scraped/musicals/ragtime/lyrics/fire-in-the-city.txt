Fire in the City


COALHOUSE

Until my demands are met, I will continue to burn down firehouses.

I will destroy the entire city if need be. Let the rules of war prevail.

Coalhouse Walker, Jr., president of the provisional American government.



REPORTER

Can I get one picture?



FATHER

You're trampling the dahlias!

Every day now, I come home to a zoo!



WELFARE OFFICIAL

Will you explain to your wife that the child is illegitimate.



MOTHER

He is not illegitimate.



WELFARE OFFICIAL

:and must be given over one of the excellent facilities

that care for these unwanted infants.



MOTHER

And he is not unwanted.



FATHER

That's enough. Get out of my house.



FATHER

All of you. Get off my property!

This is insufferable. Mr. Walker is on thing but his child's welfare is not our concern.

There are limits to even the most limitless compassion.

We've don enough for his child.



MOTHER

No one will ever do enough for this child.
