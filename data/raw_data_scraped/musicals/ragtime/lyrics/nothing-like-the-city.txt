CONDUCTOR:

You're in New Rochelle. You can atke the rope off her.

This ain't the city.



LITTLE BOY:

Mother!



MOTHER:

I see! I see! He's afraid of losing her. Immigrants

are terrified of losing their children. So are we but

just not so conspicuously. Don't stare. It's not

polite to stare.



TATEH:

He's a rude little boy. Ignore him. poeople of good

breeding do not stare at other people. they acknowledge

htem politley with a bow... like this.



Good day.



MOTHER:

Good day, sir.



TATEH:

She called me "sir."

Without a doubt,

We're really out

Of New York City!

To visit out foreworks factory.

Even the little Negro baby

Who lives in our attic!!!



MOTHER:

Who stayed on a rope

Like a puppy dog.

What does it feel like?
