The Night That Goldman Spoke at Union Square


EMMA GOLDMAN

I have just arrived from Lawrence, Massachusetts where,

eight weeks ago, the workers there went on strike. They are

starving, their children are dying but they are holding firm

and we must support them.



YOUNGER BROTHER

It was winter in New York

As the snow began to fall.

And the workmen's hall had not a seat to spare.

When a young man stepped inside,

Just to warm himself, was all,

The night that Goldman spoke at Union Square.



EMMA

What is happening in Lawrence is happening everywhere.

Let us at last make this the land of opportunity  for

all people, not just the owners. The land of opportunity

for Tateh and his little girl. We cannot rest!



YOUNGER BROTHER

She was speaking loud and fast

Through a haze of noise and heat

And the smell of sweat and anger in the air.

The police were standing by

But the crowd was on it's feet

The night that Goldman spoke at Union Square.



EMMA

You!



YOUNGER BROTHER

He thought he heard her say...



EMMA

What brings you here today?



EMMA, RALLYERS

Poor young rich boy!



EMMA

Masturbates for a Vaudeville tart!

What a waste of a fiery heart,

Dear!



YOUNGER BROTHER

He thought she said...



EMMA, RALLYERS

Poor young bourgeois!



EMMA

There are things that you've never thought.

Come to Emma and you'll be taught

Here!



YOUNGER BROTHER

His head was spinning!



EMMA, RALLYERS

People feathered and tarred, my friend.

Unions broken and why for?

Children laboring, women still enslaved!

Leave you little backyard my friend.

There are causes to die for!



RALLYERS

Strike!



YOUNGER BROTHER

In the gutters of the city

I have tried to find some meaning.



RALLYERS

Strike!



YOUNGER BROTHER

In the arms of fallen women.

In the thought of suicide.



RALLYERS

Strike!



YOUNGER BROTHER                               EMMA

Like a firework unexploded,

Wanting life but never

knowing how...

My brother,

Life had meaning

RALLYERS

Strike!

I'll show you how!

YOUNGER BROTHER

Till now!

My brother, you are

With us now!

He was calling out her name,

Shouting what, he did not know

And he found that he was standing on a chair

With a heart as clean and new

As the frshly fallen snow,

The night that Goldman spoke...



EMMA

I've been waiting for you.



YOUNGER BROTHER

At Union Square.



WORKERS

Strike! Strike! Strike! Strike!



ORGANIZER

Put the children on the train! Get them out of here!



TATEH

I hate you, goddamned America!



LITTLE GIRL

Tateh! Tateh!
