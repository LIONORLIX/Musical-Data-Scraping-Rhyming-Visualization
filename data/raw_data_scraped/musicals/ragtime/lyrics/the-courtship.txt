The Courtship


MOTHER:

Sarah, let me take him for a while. You haven't slept.



There is a knock at the door:



MOTHER:

Yes?



COALHOUSE:

I'm looking for a woman of color whose name is Sarah.

She is said to reside in one of these houses.



LITTLE BOY:

She's here. She's living in our attic.



COALHOUSE:

Will you tell her, please that Mr. Coalhouse Walker Jr.,

desires to speak with her?



MOTHER:

Certainly. Please wait here.



LITTLE BOY:

This is Sarah's baby.  You want a cookie?



MOTHER:

Sarah, you have a caller. A Mr. Walker. Will you come

down to the kitchen?



SARAH:

No Ma'am. Send him away, please.



MOTHER:

Well, that's the most words you've spoken since you've

been here.



COALHOUSE:

Hmmm...



MOTHER:

Sarah is unable to see you. Good day.



COALHOUSE:

Thank you Ma'am. Tell her I'll come back next Sunday.



GRANDFATHER:

Such was the coming of the colored man in the car

to Broadview Avenue.



ALL:

Each Sunday, he'd come driving.

Curtains would part,

Neighbours would peek.



MOTHER:

I'm sorry, Mr. Walker. Sarah still will not receive you.



COALHOUSE:

Will you see that she gets these flowers, Ma'am?



MOTHER, ALL:

Week after week!



And aftyer weeks of Sundays



MOTHER:

Sending him off seemed a crime...



Mr. Walker, it must be a long drive for you. Perhaps

you would like a cup of tea before you go?



COALHOUSE:

This piano is badly in need of a tuning.



MOTHER:

Oh yes. We are terrible about that.



GRANDFATHER:

Do you know any coon songs?



COALHOUSE:

Coon songs are made for Minstrel shows. White men

sing them in blackface. This is called Ragtime.
