Prologue: Ragtime


The little boy:

In 1902 father built a house at the crest of the brodview

Avenue hill in new rochelle, new york, and it seemed for

Some years thereafter that all the family's days would be

Warm and fair.



People of new rochelle:

The skies were blue and hazy,

Rarely a storm. Barely a chill



Women:

La la la la...



People of new rochelle:

The afternoons were lazy,

Everyone warm. Everything still.



Men:

La la la la...



All:

And there was distant music,

Simple and somehow sublime,

Giving the nation

A new syncopation-

The people called it ragtime!

Income was derived from the manufacture and sale of

Fireworks and other accoutrements of patriotism. Father

Was also something of an amateur explorer.

Domain. She took pleasure in making it comfortable

For the men of her family and often told herself how

Fortunate she was to be so protected and provided for

By her husband.

Factory. He was a genius at explosives. But he was also

And there were no immigrants.

Knew he was only an illusionist. He wanted to believe

There was more...

Emma goldman

And although the newspapers called the shooting the

Crime of the century, goldman knew it was only 1906...



All:

And there were ninety-four years to go!



Emma:

Whee!



All:

And there was music playing,

Catching a nation in its prime...

Beggar and millionaire

Everyone, everywhere

Moving to the ragtime!



All:

And there was distant music

Skipping a beat, singing a dream.



Women:

La la la la



All:

A strange, insistent music

Putting out heat,

Picking up steam.



Men:

La la la la



All:

The sound of distant thunder

Suddenly starting to climb...



It was the music:

Of something beginning,

An era exploding,

A century spinning

In riches and rags,

And in rhythm and rhyme.

The people called it ragtime...

Ragtime!

Ragtime!

Ragitme!
