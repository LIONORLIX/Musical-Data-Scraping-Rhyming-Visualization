Make Them Hear You


COAL HOUSE:

Go out and tell our story.

Let it echo far and wide.

Make them hear you.

Make them hear you.



How that justice was our battle and how justice was denied.

Make them hear you.

Make them hear you.



And say to those who blame us

For the way we chose to fight

That sometimes there are battles

That are more than black or white.



And I could not put down my sword

When justice was my right

Make them hear you

Make them hear you



Go out and tell our story

To your daughters and your sons.

Make them hear you.

Make them hear you.



And tell them in our struggles

We were not the only ones

Make them hear you.

Make them hear you.



Your sword can be a sermon

or the power of the pen

Teach every child to raise his voice

and then my brothers, then



Will justice be demanded

By ten million righteous men.

Make them hear you.

When they hear you

I'll be near you, again.
