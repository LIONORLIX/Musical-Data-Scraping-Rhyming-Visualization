Gliding


TATEH

Ssshhh. Don't cry. Don't be afraid. I'm here.

We're together.

Ssshh. Look! Ssshhh. Look what I've made for you.

See the silhouettes.

It's a little book of silhouettes.

When you flip the pages, they move.

Look how nice!

This is you on skates

Turning pretty figure-eights

On the smooth, cool ice...

We are gliding,

Gliding on a pond.

Close your eyes.

Close your eyes.

We are gliding,

Gliding far beyond.

Close your eyes.

Close your eyes.

Feel the wind

As you pirouette...

Are you happy yet?

Are you happy yet?

Your Mameh would tell you:

"Imagine you're fearless.

Imagine you're fearless

And soon, you won't fear!"

When I am afraid,

I imagine your Mameh.

She skates just ahead.

Can you see her?

She's here!

And we're...

Gliding,

Gliding far away.

Pirouettes,

Figure-eights,

Silver skates...

Just down the track.

Glide with me, little one.

Glide with your Tateh.

We'll never

Look back!



CONDUCTOR

My kid would like that! How much?



TATEH

It's not for... A dollar?



CONDUCTOR

What do you call it?



TATEH

I...



CONDUCTOR

It's gotta have a name. I'm not paying this much for

something without a name.



TATEH

They move. I call them... movie... books!Your father is a

smart man! With this money, we'll get a clean bed and a hot

bath, and tomorrow we will make more of these and we will

sell them for two dollars. Tateh's movie books! Everyone

will want them. They just don't know that yet!

We are gliding,

Gliding far away.

Pirouettes,

Figure-eights,

Silver skates

Just down the track!

Glide with me, little one,

Glide with your Tateh.

We'll never

Look back!
