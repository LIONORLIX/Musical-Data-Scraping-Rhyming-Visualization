What Kind of Woman


Mother:

Get kathleen!

Get kathleen, i tell you! Call the doctor!



Kathleen:

Is it alive? Oh, please, god, let it be.



Mother:

It's alive. It's a negro child. A newborn baby boy.



What kind of woman

Would do such a thing?



Why in god's name

Is my husband not here?



I'm such a fool!



Why did i say

He was free to go?

What am i to do?

Where are your instructions,

My dear?

You left me lists.

Everything in lists!

Well, your little lists

Aren't very helpful,

I fear!

Each day, the maids

Trudge up the hill.

The hired help arrives.

I never stopped to think

They might

Have lives beyond out lives...



Policeman:

We found her in the cellar of a home on the next

Block. She's a washwoman there. Her name is sarah.



Mother:

Where will you take her?



Policeman:

To the charity ward. Eventually she will have to

Stand trial.



Younger brother:

What charges?



Policeman:

Well, attempted murder, i should think.



Mother:

What's going to happen to the baby?



Doctor:

They have places for unfortunates like this.



Mother:

I will take responsibility for mother and child.

Please take miss sarah inside.



What kind of woman

Would do what i've done-

Open the door

To such chaos and pain!

You would have

Gently closed the door,

And gently turned the key,

And gently told me not to look,

For fear of what i'd see.



What kind of woman

Would that have made me?
