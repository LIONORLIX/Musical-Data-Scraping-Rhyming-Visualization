Wheels of a Dream


COALHOUSE:

I see his face.

I hear his heartbeat.

I look in those eyes.

How wise they seem.

Well, when he is old enough

I will show him America

And he will ride

on the wheels of a dream.



COALHOUSE:

We'll go down South



SARAH:

Go down South,



COALHOUSE:

And see your people



SARAH:

See my folks.



COALHOUSE:

Won't they take to him



SARAH:

They'll take to him



COALHOUSE:

Like cats to cream!



SARAH:

Mmm...



COALHOUSE:

Then we'll travel on from there.



SARAH:

California or who knows where!



BOTH:

And we will ride

On the wheels of a dream.



COALHOUSE:

Yes, the wheels are turning for us, girl.

And the times are starting to roll.

Any man can get where he wants to

If he's got some fire in his soul.

We'll see justice, Sarah,

And plenty of men

Who will stand up

And give us our due.

Oh, Sarah, it's more that promises.

Sarah, it must be true.

A country that let's a man like me

Own a car, raise a child, build a life with you...



COALHOUSE:

With you...



SARAH:

With you...



BOTH:

Beyond that road,

Beyond this lifetime

That care full of hope

Will always gleam!

With the promise of happiness

And the freedom he'll live to know.

He'll travle with head held high,

Just as far as his heart can go

And he will ride-

Our son will ride-

On the wheels of a dream.
