Getting' Ready Rag


All:

Gettin' ready rag...

Gettin' ready rag...

Gettin', gettin', gettin' ready rag.



Women:

Anything it takes.



Men:

Anything you need.



All:

You gotta find your girl, coalhouse

And win her back!



All:

Gettin' ready rag!



Men:

Ready as you'll ever get-



Coalhouse:

Not yet!



Women:

Gotta win the girl, coalhouse.



Coalhouse:

Think of what a better man she'll see

When mr. Henry ford puts me

At the wheel of a model t!
