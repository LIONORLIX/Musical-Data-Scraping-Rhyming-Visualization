Wheels of a Dream (reprise)


LITTLE BOY:

The era of ragtime had run out,

As if history were no more than a tune on a player piano.

But we did not know that then.



COALHOUSE:

I see his face.



SARAH:

I hear his heartbeat.



COALHOUSE:

I look in those eyes.



BOTH:

How wise they seem.



COALHOUSE:

Well, when he is old enough,

I will show him america



BOTH:

And he will ride

On the wheels of a dream.



ALL:

Beyond that road,

Beyond this lifetime,

That car full of hope

Will always gleam

With the promise of happiness

And the freedom we'll live to know

We'll travel with heads held high

Just as far as our hearts can go

And we will ride,

Each child will ride

On the wheels of a dream!
