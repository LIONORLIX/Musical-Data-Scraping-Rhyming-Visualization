Where Is The Tribe For Me?


Where? Where? Where is the tribe for me?

Where living in some primitive stage

Is that unsteady breed

Who've somehow managed

coming of age

Un-helped by Margaret Mead

Where? Where?

Where is my ethnic group?

Where are those savage Pre-Adamites

Who live unseen, unknown

Waiting to show me puberty rites

That I can call my own?

You're not an etymologist

Until you get the word

You're not an ornithologist

Until you get the bird

Like some unfrocked theologist

I haven't got a prayer

I'm not an anthropologist

Until I write a diatribe

On why a tribe is there

But where? Where can they be at?

Where's their nat-ural habitat?

While they still roam free

Anthropologically, tell me where

Where is the tribe for -

Sometimes I -- I see myself searching, searching

Through the jungle, dark and deep

On safari, searching for my tribe

To the wild birds: Ah! Ah!

And the poison darts: *hiss* *thump*

And the jungle cats: *yawn*

And the - *snap*

Tsetse flies

*Gasp* Food gone, water gone

All the guides have run away

And the drums, the drums searching for my tribe

To the boa constrictors: *hiss* *hiss*

And the gorillas: Ah! Ah!

And the quick sand: *slurp* *slurp*

And the: Ah! Ah! *hiss* *thump* *yawn* *snap*

Tsetse flies

One word through the area

Burning with malaria

Alone in my safari

And there's no one to be sorry if

I rot with dry rot

*Gasp* But wait *Gasp* Wait!

Look there! Look there!

Through the giant bush-wood trees

Grass huts! Cooking fires! Can it be my tribe?

Now they're coming!

Strangely painted savages

And at last I've found them!

Here is the tribe for me

No more laughing hyenas - hee, hee, hee!

No more stampeding elephants - hoo, hoo!

No more drums - bubalawoopay!

No more:

*hiss* *hiss* Ah! Ah! *slurp* *slurp* Ah! Ah! *hiss* *thump* *yawn*

*snap*

Tsetse flies!

Oh yes, here, here is my tribe!

And now they come to greet me, crying: Wanna! Wanna!

Well, yes, I wanna! I wanna tribe!

And they take me to meet their chief

And I enter a large hut

And I hear the strange music of -

Oh no, it can't be, it's -

Albert, you've beat me to it again!

Albert, tell me please, where

Where? Where is the tribe for me?

One that has not heard of NYU, DAR, or LBJ

People who bear no allegiance to CIO or CRA

Oh please! I'm on bended knees!

Where are these aborigines

Who were meant to be

My Ph.D.

Tell me where

Where is the tribe for me?
