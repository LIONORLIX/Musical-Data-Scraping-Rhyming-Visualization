Love Is A Chance


But don't shy clear of love, just for fear of love.

Cease it when it first fills your heart.

Be a little premature... love can grow and be mature.

Only if you trust it from the start.

Love is a chance, made to be taken.

Why should I take to my heels?

Why run away from mayhem that may come?

Maybe I'll like how it feels.

Love is a chance, flighty and fleeting.

Here like Quicksilver than gone!

High-ho Quicksilver, I'm riding with you, whether its hether or yon!

See how my heart's open wide?

Hey there, love take a good seat inside and stay there.

Love is a chance, chance to be happy,

in one fantastical stroke!

Now's my big chance, and I'm a gambler, ready to go for broke.

See how my heart's open wide?

Hey there, love take a good seat inside and stay there.

Love is a chance, chance to be happy,

in one fantastical stroke!

Now's my big chance, and I'm a gambler, ready to go...

ready to go...

ready to go... for broke!!
