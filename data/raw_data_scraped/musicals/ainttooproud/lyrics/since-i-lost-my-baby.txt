Since I Lost My Baby


Sun a-shining, there's plenty of life

A new day is dawning sunny and bright

But after I've been crying all night the sun is cold

And the new day seems old

Since I lost my baby (since I lost my baby)

Since I lost my baby (since I lost my baby)

Birds are singing and the children are playing

There's plenty of work and the bosses are paying

Not a sad word should my young heart be saying

But fun is a bore and with money I'm poor

Since I lost my baby (since I lost my baby)

Since I lost my baby (since I lost my baby)

Next time I'll be kinder (next time I'll be kinder)

Won't you please help me find her (won't you please help me find her)?

Someone just remind her (someone just remind her)

'Bout this love she left behind her ('bout this love she left behind her)

'Til I find her I'll be tryin' now, every day I'm more inclined to find her

Inclined to find her, inclined to find my baby

Been a-looking everywhere, baby, I really, really care

Oh, determination is fading fast

Inspiration is a thing of the past

Can't see my hope's gonna last

Good things are bad and what's happy is sad

Since I lost my baby (since I lost my baby)

Since I lost my baby (since I lost my baby)

I feel so bad

Oh, I'll feel so sad

Everything is wrong (since I lost my baby)

This heart is hard to carry on

(Since I lost my baby) I'm lost as can be

(Since I lost my baby) what's gonna happen to me?
