Runaway Child, Running Wild


You played hookie from school and you can't go out to play, yeah

Mama said, for the rest of the week, in your room you gotta stay, yeah

Oh ho, now you feel like the whole world's pickin' on you

But deep down inside, you know it ain't true

You're in punishment

'Cause your mother wants to raise you in the right way, yeah

But you don't care

'Cause you already made up your mind you wanna run away yeah

You're on your way, runaway child, running wild

Runaway child running wild

Better go back home where you belong

Roaming through the city going nowhere fast, you're on your own at last

Hey, it's gettin' late, where will you sleep?

You're gettin' kinda hungry, you forgot to bring something to eat

Oh, lost with no money you start to cry

But remember, you left home wantin' to be grown, so dry your weeping eyes

Sirens screamin' down neon lighted streets

You want your mama

Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run

Are they looking for you?

You're frightened and confused

I want my mama

Run, run, run, run, run, run, run

But she's much too far away, she can't hear a word you say

You've heard some frightening news on the radio

About little boys running away from home

And the parents don't see them no more

You wanna stop to hitch a ride, I know

But your mama told you never trust a stranger

And you don't know which way to go

Streets are dark and deserted, not a sound nor sign of life

Oh how you long to hear your mother's voice, 'cause you're lost and alone

But remember, you made the choice, runaway child, running wild

You better go back home where you belong

He he he, oh, runaway child, running wild

You better go back home where you belong

You're lost in this great big city

Go back home where you belong

Not one familiar face, ain't it a pity

Go back home where you belong

Oh, runaway child running wild

You better go back home where you belong

Oh yeah, my girl

Mama, mama, please, come and sit here by me

Oh but she's much too far away, she can't hear a word you say

Oh, you're frightened and confused, which way will you choose
