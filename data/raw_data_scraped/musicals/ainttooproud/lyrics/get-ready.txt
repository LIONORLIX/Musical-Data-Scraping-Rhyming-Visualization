Get Ready


I never met a girl who makes me feel the way that you do

(It's alright)

Whenever I'm asked who makes my dreams real

I say that you do

(you're outta sight)

So fee fi fo fum

Look out baby 'cause here I come

And I'm bringing you a love that's true so get ready

So get ready

I'm gonna try to make love to you so get ready

So get ready here I come

I'm on my way

If you wanna play hide and seek with love let me remind you

(It's alright)

The loving you're gonna miss and the time it takes to find you

(It's outta sight)

So fiddle-lee-dee fiddle-lee-dum

Look out baby 'cause here I come

And I'm bringing you a love that's true so get ready

So get ready

I'm gonna try to make love to you so get ready

So get ready here I come

I'm on my way

All my friends shouldn't want me to I understand it

(Be alright)

I hope I'll get to you before they do the way I planned it

(Be outta sight)

So twiddle-dee-dee twiddle dee dum

Look out baby 'cause here I come

And I'm bringing you a love that's true so get ready

So get ready

I'm gonna try to make love to you so get ready

So get ready here I come

I'm on my way

Get ready 'cause here I come, boy

Get ready 'cause here I come, boy

Get ready 'cause here I come, boy
