This Moment


This moment, perfect, golden, grasp it, see it.

This moment, laughing, happy, feel it, be it.



Curve of face, Warmth of hands, Butterfly

Pin in place, When it lands, Try, try



This moment, ripened, bursting, taste it, name it

This moment, precious, fleeting, catch it, frame it.

Curve of moon, warmth of air, willow bow

Winter soon, be aware now, how



This sadness, aching, reaching,looking on

at this moment, present, distant

Shining, bauble, touch it, lose it.

Happy, laughing, perfect, golden, gone.
