It Feels Like Home


I hear your key in the door

Unlocking more than wood

The ceiling may not be dry yet

But it feels like home



Yes, we have come from a long way

Friends say wrong way

Still, I only know when you hold me

It feels like home



We don't need a dining room table

So far there's no one to invite

For me a cardboard box will do just fine

As long as I'm with you each night



It seems to me if you never ask

You'll never win

And since we're in this together

It feels like home



We don't need a dining room table

So far there's no one to invite

For me a cardboard box will do just fine

As long as I'm with you each night



Yes, we have come from a long way

Friends say wrong way

Still, I only know when you hold me

It feels like home

It feels like home

It feels like home
