That Smile


Sha da da da da da da da-da-da

Sha da da da da da da da

Sha da da da da da da da



That smile, it cracks your face

It cracks me up

It cracks down hard on my resistance to the love me in your eyes



Sha da da da da da da da da



And when you smile that lightning way you do

You do away with gray by flashing bites of blue behind my cloudy sky



Sha da



I know (no no no no no) you're capable of glowing in the dark

And I know (no no no no no) you're kissable

For grinning up that spark

To warm the deepest part of me

To shine some sense on all I can be

To help my aspirations meet their mark



Sha da da da da



With that smile you bear your strength

You bear the weight of all the disappointments

Scraping through this life can bring



Da da de-ah da da da de-ah da da de-ah

da da



And when you smile that sunrise way you do

You light a lesson in the art of sliding through the worst of anything



Da da da da

I know (no no no no no) you're capable of glowing in the dark

And I know (no no no no no) you're kissable

For grinning up that spark

To warm the deepest part of me

To shine some sense on all I can be

To help my aspirations meet their mark



And even though we've barely met

You smiled one smile I can't forget

The basis for some grand internal war



Sha da da da da



You see I think I'm falling for that crazy smile of yours



(A capella harmony)



I know you're capable of glowing in the dark

I know you're kissable

For grinning up that spark

To warm the deepest part of me

To shine some sense on all I can be

To help my aspirations meet their mark



And even though we've barely met

You smiled one smile I can't forget

The basis for some grand internal war



You see I think I'm falling

(You see I think I'm falling)

(You see for that)



Crazy smile of yours
