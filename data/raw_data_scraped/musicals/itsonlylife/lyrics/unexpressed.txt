Unexpressed


Sometimes I think my heart will burst

Like a balloon inside my chest

With all the love thats waiting here,

Unexpressed.



Fingers that ache to intertwine

Warmest of chords, but missing tune

Where is the laugh to echo mine

Send it soon



The words my lips would form,

The circle these two arms would make safe and warm

Someone could be safe and warm



But,

Maybe the love we yearn to give,

Can find a release some ther way,

Coloring how we choose to live every day

The kindness we can share



(musical interlude)



The kindness we can share

The comfort these two arms might lend in despair

Someone's always in despair



Still I'm,

Longing to meet that pair of eyes

Dark as the night or endless blue

Holding a light I'll recognize

Something clear, something true



Something that seems to mean,

Something I haven't seen since,

You
