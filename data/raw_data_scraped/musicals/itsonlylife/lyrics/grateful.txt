Grateful


I've got a roof over my head

I've got a warm place to sleep

Some nights I lie awake counting gifts

Instead of counting sheep



I've got a heart that can hold love

I've got a mind that can think

There may be times when I lose the light

And let my spirits sink

But I can't stay depressed

When I remeber how I'm blessed



Grateful, grateful

Truly grateful I am

Grateful, grateful

Truly blessed

And duly grateful



In a city of strangers

I've got a family of friends

No matter what rocks and brambles fill the way

I know that they will stay until the end



I feel a hand holding my hand

It's not a hand you can see

But on the road to the promised land

This hand will shepherd me

Through delight and despair

Holding tight and always there



Grateful, grateful

Truly grateful I am

Grateful, grateful

Truly blessed

And duly grateful



It's not that I don't want a lot

Or hope for more, or dream of more

But giving thanks for what I've got

Makes me so much happier than keeping score



In a world that can bring pain

I will still take each chance

For I believe that whatever the terrain

Our feet can learn to dance

Whatever stone life may sling

We can moan or we can sing



Grateful, grateful

Truly grateful I am

Grateful, grateful

Truly blessed

And duly grateful
