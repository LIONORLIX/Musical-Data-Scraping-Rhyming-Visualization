I'm Not Waiting/Progression


[Man 2]

I?m not waiting for the sun

To dance and spin above me

I?m not waiting for the one to rush right in and love me



[Woman 1]

I?m not waiting for a door

To open on a face

I?m not waiting anymore frozen in place

A deer in the light,

Eyes all aglow blind at the sight of a thing I just know

Has to be right.

I?m not waiting



[Man 3]

I?m not waiting for a smile to tell me life?s worth living

I?ve been waiting for a while and time is unforgiving



[Man 1]

Someone beams my better half

Someone screams I?m sorry

Someone can no longer laugh caught in between

The say and the mean

Fearing the worst, lost the routine, bubble is burst with all that I?ve seen

I?m not waiting



[Woman 2]

Who made the rule that two is better than one?

I bet that fool is alone by a phone coming undone

Go ahead and read your books and practice looks

Prepare your hooks for baiting

I?m not looking to the skies

I?m not leaping for the prize

I?m not catching any eyes in hopes they might complete me

I am not incomplete

This solitude is sweet.

I?m not waiting
