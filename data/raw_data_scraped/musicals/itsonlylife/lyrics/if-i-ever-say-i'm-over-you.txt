If I Ever Say I'm Over You


If I ever say I'm over you

The unsentimental things I do

Will have driven out the ghosts,

Somehow,

And pulled me through



If I tend to disregard your touch

Well, it seems to me it would be

Such a waste of time to let this poor heart

Feel that much



But sometimes a photograph

Can make me cry or force a laugh

And somehow the memory

Of how complete we used to be

Is keeping me from you



If you ever hear me doubt the past

It's a simple fact; we didn't last

Run aground on hard times

While the good times flew too fast



I'm not sure if we can make amends

This may be the way out story ends

With too little left for lovers

And too much for friends



But sometimes a photograph

Can make me cry or force a luagh

And somehow the memory

Of how complete we used to be

Is keeping me from you

So don't believe it's true

If I ever say I'm over you
