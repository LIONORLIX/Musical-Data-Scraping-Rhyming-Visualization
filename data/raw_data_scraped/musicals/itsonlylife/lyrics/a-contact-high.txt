A Contact High


So big deal, what if I did walk in at 3:30 AM?

You act like I was some kind of?

Hey did you see those lights in the driveway?

Nevermind, no I?m fine its just that?

Hey did you hear a dog in the trash cans?

It must be my imagination, now where was I?

Oh yeah I think you need a drink,

You should relax you?re too upset over a little thing like this,

Yes I wear my shades at night.



Grounded?!

What do you mean? No I don?t smell anything odd

There was a lot of incense at the?

Hey not my glasses! Yeah, there a little bloodshot;

On the way home some dirt flew on my contact lens.

Alright, so some of the guys were smoking pot, but I was not!

Have you ever known me to lie?

Must have been a contact high.
