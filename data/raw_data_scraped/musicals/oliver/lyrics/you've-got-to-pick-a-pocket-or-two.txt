You've Got to Pick a Pocket or Two


FAGIN



(spoken) You see, Oliver...



(sung) In this life, one thing counts

In the bank, large amounts

I'm afraid these don't grow on trees,

You've got to pick-a-pocket or two



You've got to pick-a-pocket or two, boys,

You've got to pick-a-pocket or two.



BOYS



Large amounts don't grow on trees.

You've got to pick-a-pocket or two.



FAGIN



(spoken) Let's show Oliver how it's done, shall we, my dears?



(sung) Why should we break our backs

Stupidly paying tax?

Better get some untaxed income

Better to pick-a-pocket or two.



You've got to pick-a-pocket or two, boys

You've got to pick-a-pocket or two.



BOYS



Why should we all break our backs?

Better pick-a-pocket or two.



FAGIN



(spoken) Who says crime doesn't pay?



(sung) Robin Hood, what a crook!

Gave away, what he took.

Charity's fine, subscribe to mine.

Get out and pick-a-pocket or two



You've got to pick-a-pocket or two, boys

You've got to pick-a-pocket or two.



BOYS



Robin Hood was far too good

He had to pick-a-pocket or two.



FAGIN



Take a tip from Bill Sikes

He can whip what he likes.

I recall, he started small

He had to pick-a-pocket or two.



You've got to pick-a-pocket or two, boys

You've got to pick-a-pocket or two.



BOYS



We can be like old Bill Sikes

If we pick-a-pocket or two.



FAGIN



(spoken) Stop thief!



Dear old gent passing by

Something nice takes his eye

Everything's clear, attack the rear

Get in and pick-a-pocket or two.



You've got to pick-a-pocket or two, boys

You've got to pick-a-pocket or two.



BOYS



Have no fear, attack the rear

Get in and pick-a-pocket or two.



FAGIN



When I see someone rich,

Both my thumbs start to itch

Only to find some peace of mind

We have to pick-a-pocket or two.



You've got to pick-a-pocket or two, boys

You've got to pick-a-pocket or two.



BOYS



Just to find some peace of mind



FAGIN AND BOYS



We have to pick-a-pocket or two!







Rum Tum Tum



FAGIN



(spoken) Just do everything you see Dodger and Charlie do.

Make 'em your models, my dear -- especially Dodger --

He's going to be right little... Bill Sikes! Tell me my dear,

you see my hankerchief? See if you can take it from me without

my noticing -- like you saw the others do.



Rum-tum-tum,

Rum-tum-tum

Pom-pom-pom

Pom-pom-pom

Skiddle-eye-tye

Tee-rye-tye-tye

Tee-ruppa-tuppa-ruppa-tum-tum

You've got to pick a pocket or two! You've got to pick a pocket or two!
