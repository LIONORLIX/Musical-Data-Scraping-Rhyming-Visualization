That was the mite

With the large appetite



BOTH



(sung) Oliver! Oliver!



MR. BUMBLE



Apparently he's from a rich family!



WIDOW CORNEY



And to think we

Nearly

Stupidly went and lost track of him...



MR. BUMBLE



If the truth were

Know we

Both were delighted at seeing the back of him.



BOTH



(sung) Oliver! Oliver!



MR. BUMBLE



What'll we do...?



WIDOW CORNEY



We must give him his due...



BOTH



...And we'll praise the day

Somebody gave us



MR. BUMBLE



Raise the flags



WIDOW CORNEY



Coming to save us



BOTH



Cash rewards



MR. BUMBLE



Plus a promotion



WIDOW CORNEY



Who'd have thought?

Hadn't a notion

Praise the lord, somebody brought us O-li-ver!
