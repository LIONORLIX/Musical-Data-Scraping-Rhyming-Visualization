MR. BUMBLE



For what you are about to receive

May the Lord make you truly thankful.



BOYS



Amen!



OLIVER



(spoken) Please, Sir, I want some more.



MR. BUMBLE



(spoken) What?!



OLIVER



(spoken) Please, Sir, I want some... more.



MR. BUMBLE



(spoken) More!?



WIDOW CORNEY



Catch him!



MR. BUMBLE



Snatch him!



WIDOW CORNEY



Hold him!



MR. BUMBLE



Scold him!



WIDOW CORNEY



Pounce him!

Trounce him!

Pick him up and bounce him!



MR. BUMBLE



Wait!

Before we put the lad to task

May I be so curious as to ask

His name?



BOYS (whispering)



O-li-ver.



WIDOW CORNEY AND MR. BUMBLE



Oliver! Oliver!



MR. BUMBLE



Never beofre has a boy wanted more!



MR. BUMBLE AND WIDOW CORNEY



Oliver! Oliver!



WIDOW CORNEY



Won't ask for more when he knows what's in store.



MR. BUMBLE



There's a dark, thin, winding stairway

Without any bannister

Which we'll throw him down, and feed him on

Cockrouches served in a canister



ALL



Oliver! Oliver!



MR. BUMBLE



What will he do when he's turned black and blue?

He will curse the day

Somebody named him



ALL



O-li-ver!



MR. BUMBLE



Oliver! Oliver!

Never before has a boy wanted more!

Oliver! Oliver!



WIDOW CORNEY



Won't ask for more

When he knows what's in store.



MR. BUMBLE



There's a sooty chimney

Long overdue for a sweeping out

Which we'll push him up,

And one day next year with the rats he'll be creeping out.



ALL



Oliver! Oliver!



MR. BUMBLE



What will he do?

In this terrible stew?

He will rue the day somebody named him...



ALL AND WIDOW CORNEY



O-li-ver!



GOVERNORS



Oliver!

Oliver!

Never before has a boy asked for more

Oliver!

Oliver!



CHAIRMAN



Pray some decorum restore, I implore...

Let us face this case, it's

Unprecedented, quite utterly.



GOVERNORS



He's disgraced this place.



LARGE GOVERNOR



And encouraging others to swallow in gluttony.



ALL



Oliver!...Oliver!

Lock him in gaol

And then put him on sale,

For the highest bid

Glad to be rid

Of

O-li-ver!



WIDOW CORNEY



(spoken) Lock him up! Collect his belongings then bring him back to me

when you've done. To bed, all of you!
