Where Is Love?


MRS. SOWEBERRY



(spoken) Right then, Oliver Twist, your bed's underneath the counter.

You don't mind sleeping among coffins I suppose?

It don't much matter whether you do or you don't cause you

can't sleep nowhere else!



OLIVER



Where is love?

Does it fall from skies above?

Is it underneath the willow tree

That I've been dreaming of?

Where is she?

Who I close my eyes to see?

Will I ever know the sweet "hello"

That's only meant for me?

Who can say where she may hide?

Must I travel far and wide?

'Til I am bedside the someone who

I can mean something to ...

Where...?

Where is love?



Who can say where...she may hide?

Must I travel...far and wide?

'Til I am beside...the someone who

I can mean...something to...

Where?

Where is love?
