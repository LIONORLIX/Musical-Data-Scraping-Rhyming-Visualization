I Shall Scream


WIDOW CORNEY



(spoken) You're a cruel man. And a hardhearted man besides.



MR. BUMBLE



(spoken) Hardhearted, Mrs. Corney? Hard? Are you hardhearted, Mrs. Corney?



WIDOW CORNEY



(spoken) Dear me! What a curious question coming from a single man.

What can you want to know

for, Mr. Bumble? Mr. Bumble, I shall scream!



MR. BUMBLE



No you wouldn't, heigh ho.

If I wanted something special,

Then you couldn't say "no".

Did I nearly catch you smiling?

Yes I did. And it's beguiling.

If you hand is close, I'll press it.

Yes, you like it -- come confess it!

Yes, you do...



WIDOW CORNEY



No, I don't.



MR. BUBLE



Yes, you do!



WIDOW CORNEY



I shall scream! I shall scream!

'Til they hasten to my rescue, I shall scream.



MR. BUMBLE



Since there's nobody that's near us

Who cold see us. or could hear us?

If you ask you can I kiss you

Say what will my pretty miss do?



WIDOW CORNEY



I shall scream, scream, scream!



MR. BUMBLE



If I pinch you one pinch --

From you shy protective shell

Can I un-inch you one inch?

Will my blinthesome, buxum beauty

Let her suitor do his duty?

Tho' his lap ain't very large, dear

Sit upon it -- There's no charge, dear.

Will you sit?



WIDOW CORNEY



No, I shan't



MR. BUMBLE



Will you sit?



WIDOW BUMBLE



I shall scream! I shall scream!

For the safety of my virtue I shall sream

Tho' your knee is rather cosy,

See my cheeks are getting rosy.

You would have me in your power.

If I sat here for an hour...



MR. BUMBLE



I shall scream, scream, scream!



WIDOW CORNEY



You're a naughty bad man.

If you think I can't be proper,

Prim and haughty -- I can

And you'll pardon if I mention

You must state your true intention.



MR. BUMBLE



Is there not another room here?



WIDOW CORNEY



No!



MR. BUMBLE



If there would be a bride and groom here --- would there be?



WIDOW CORNEY



Well there might.



MR. BUMBLE



We shall see.



WIDOW CORNEY



I shall scream! I shall scream!

At the thought of what you're thinking, I shall scream!



MR. BUMBLE



You will wonder where the scream went

When we come to an agreement

As my lovey-dovey is chubby

Could she love a chubby hubby?



WIDOW CORNEY



I shall scream, Mr. Bumble!

I shall scream, Bumble-Wumble!

I shall scream, scream, scream!
