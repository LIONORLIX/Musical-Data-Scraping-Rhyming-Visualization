Consider yourself at home.

Consider yourlef one of the familhy.

It's clear we're going to get along.

Consider yourself well in

Consider yourslef par to the furniture.

There isn't a lot to spare.

Who cares?..What ever we've goin we share!



If it should chance to be

Some harder days

Empty larder days

Why grouse?

Alsyas a-chance we'll meet

Somebody

To foot the bill

Then the drinks are on the house!

Consider yourself our mate.

For after some consideration, we can state...

Consider yourself
