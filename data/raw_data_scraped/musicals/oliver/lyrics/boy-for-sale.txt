Boy for Sale


WIDOW CORNEY



(spoken) Get a good price for him, Mr. Bumble.



MR. BUMBLE



One boy,

Boy for sale.

He's going cheap.

Only seven guineas.

That -- or thereabouts.



Small boy...

Rather pale...

Through lack of sleep.

Feed him gruel dinners.

Stop him getting stout.



If I should say he wasn't very greedy...

I could not, I'd be telling you a tale.

One boy,

Boy for sale.

Come take a peep.

Have you ever seen as

Nice

A boy

For sale.
