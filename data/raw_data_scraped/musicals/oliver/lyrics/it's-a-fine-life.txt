It's a Fine Life


NANCY



(spoken) Plummy and slam!



FAGIN



(spoken) Nancy! Wake up boys! The ladies is 'ere.



DODGER



(spoken) Ladies?! Cor! 'Ark at him!



NANCY



(spoken) 'Ere, we'll have less of that if you don't mind!

'Ere, so where's the gin, then, Fagin?



FAGIN



(spoken) All in moderation, my dear, all in moderation.

Too much gin can be a dangerous thing for a pure, young girl.



NANCY



(spoken) Ooh, and what's wrong with a bit of danger then, eh, Mr. Fagin?

After all it's about the only excitement we get. And who would deny us

that small pleasure?



(sung) Small pleasures, small pleasures

Who would deny us these?

Gin toddies -- large measuress --

No skimpin' if you please!

I rough it, I love it

Life is a game of chance.

I never tire of it --

Leading this merry dance.

If you don't mind having to go without things

It's a fine life.



ALL



It's a fine life.



NANCY



Tho' it ain't all jolly old pleasure outings...

It's a fine life



ALL



It's a fine life.



NANCY



When you got someone to love

You forget your cares and strife

Let the prudes look down on us

Let the wide world frown on us

It's a fine,



ALL



Fine life!



NANCY



(spoken) Ain't that right, Bet? Go on, you tell 'em girl.



BET



Who cares if straightlaces

Sneer at us in the street?

Fine airs and fine graces



NANCY



Don't have to sin to eat.



BOTH



We wander through London



NANCY



Who knows what we many find?



BOTH



There's pockets left undone

On many a behind.



NANCY



If you don't mind taking it as it turns out,

It's a fine life!



ALL



It's a fine life!



NANCY



Keep the candle burning until it burns out

It's a fine life.



ALL



It's a fine life.



NANCY



Though you sometimes do come by

The occasional black eye

You can always cover one

'Til he blacks the other one

But you don't dare cry.



BET



No flounces, no feathers

No frills and furbelows

All winds and all weathers

Ain't good for fancy clo'es



NANCY



(spoken) That's true.



(sung) These trappings,



BET



These ta'ers



BOTH



These we can just afford.



NANCY



What future?



BET



What ma'ers?



BOTH



We've got our bed and board.



NANCY



If you don't mind having to deal with Fagin

It's a fine life!



ALL



It's a fine life!



NANCY



Though diseased rats threaten to bring the plague in

It's a fine life!



ALL



It's a fine life!



NANCY



But the grass is green and dense

On the right side of the 'fence'.



BOTH



And we take good care of it

That we get our share of it

And we don't mean pence.



No! If you don't mind having to like or lump it...

It's a fine life



ALL



It's a fine life!



NANCY



Tho' there's no tea-supping and eating crumpet

It's a fine life!



ALL



It's a fine life!



NANCY



Not for me, the happy home

Happy husband, happy wife

Tho' it sometimes touches me...

...For the likes of such as me...

Mine's a fine...



ALL



Fine... life!
