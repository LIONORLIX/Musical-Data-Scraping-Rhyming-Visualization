Be Back Soon


DODGER



Line up!



BOYS



Line up!



DODGER



Single file!



BOYS



Single file!

Slope arms

Left...left

Right...right...Ol! Ol!



FAGIN



You can go,

But be back soon

You can go,

But while you're working.

This place,

I'm pacing round...

Until you're home,

...Safe and sound



Fare thee well,

But be back soon

Who can tell

Where danger's lurking?

Do not forget this tune

Be back soon.



BOYS



How could we forget

How could we let

Our dear old Fagin worry?

We love him so.

We'll come back home

In, oh, such a great big

Hurry



DODGER



It's him that pays the piper.



BOYS



It's us that pipes his tune

So long, fare thee well

Pip! Pip! Cheerio!

We'll be back soon.



FAGIN



You can go

But be back soon

You can go,

But bring back plenty

Of pocket hankerchiefs

And you should be clever thieves.

Whip it quick,

and be back soon

There's a sixpence here for twenty

Ain't that a lovely tune?

Be back soon.



DODGER



Our pockets'll hold

A watch of gold

That chimes upon the hour



BOYS



A wallet fat

An old man's hat



DODGER



The crown jewels from the tower

We know

The Bow Street Runners,



ALL



But they don't know this tune.

So long, fare thee well.

Pip! Pip! Cheerio!

We'll be back soon.



FAGIN



Cheerio, but be back soon.

I dunno, somehow I'll miss you

I love you, that why I

Say, "Cheerio"...

Not goodbye.



Don't be gone long

Be back soon.

Give me one long,

Last look...

Bless you.

Remember our old tune...

Be back soon!



BOYS



We must disappear,

We'll be back here,

Today...

...Perhaps tomorrow.

We'll miss you too



FAGIN



It's sad but true

That parting is such sweet sorrow.



ALL



And when we're in the distance

You'll hear this

Whipered tune...

So long, fare thee well

Pip! Pip! Cheerio!

We'll be back soon



And when we're in the distance

You'll hear this

Whipered tune...

So long, fare thee well

Pip! Pip! Cheerio!

We'll be back soon

FAGIN



Cheerio, but be back soon.

I dunno, somehow I'll miss you

I love you, that why I

Say, "Cheerio"...

Not goodbye.



Don't be gone long

Be back soon.

Give me one long,

Last look...

Bless you.

Remember our old tune...

Be back soon!

BOYS



We must disappear,

We'll be back here,

Today...

...Perhaps tomorrow.

We'll miss you too



It's sad but true

That parting is such sweet sorrow.



And when we're in the distance

You'll hear this

Whipered tune...

So long, fare thee well

Pip! Pip! Cheerio!

We'll be back soon



And when we're in the distance

You'll hear this

Whipered tune...

So long, fare thee well

Pip! Pip! Cheerio!

We'll be back soon



And when we're in the distance

You'll hear this

Whipered tune...

So long, fare thee well

Pip! Pip! Cheerio!

We'll be back soon



OLIVER



So long, fare thee well

Pip! Pip! Cheerio!

We'll be back soon



BOYS



So long, fare thee well

Pip! Pip! Cheerio!

We'll be back soon
