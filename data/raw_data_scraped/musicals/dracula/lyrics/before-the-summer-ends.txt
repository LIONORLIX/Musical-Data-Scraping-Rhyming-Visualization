Before the Summer Ends


Harker:

She made me give my promise,

A terrifying promise,

It`s not the kind of promise made every day.

To desecrate a temple,

To trample on a flower,

To catch a butterfly and simply tear off its wings,

It`s worse than all of these things.



To dim the sun before the summer ends,

to burn the castle down,

Before the princess is awake,

To kill our love when it`s still so alive,

I would not do it,

My heart would break.



But i have given her my word

And if the time should come,

I will do what i must,

How could i`



To dim the sun before the summer ends,

to burn the castle down,

Before the princess is awake,

To kill our love when it`s still so alive,

I`ll keep my word and,

My heart will break.

I`ll keep my word and,

My heart will break.
