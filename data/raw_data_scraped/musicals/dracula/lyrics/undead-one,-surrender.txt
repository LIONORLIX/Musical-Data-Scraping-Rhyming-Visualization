Undead One, Surrender


Van Helsing:

Undead one, surrender!

Prepare to bow before Christ!



All:

Undead one, surrender!

Prepare to bow before Christ!

Bow before Christ!



Holmwood:

Bow...before...Christ.



All:

This cross, this crucifix

Can bring you back to peace and love

This holy crucifix

Can lift you to Heaven above!
