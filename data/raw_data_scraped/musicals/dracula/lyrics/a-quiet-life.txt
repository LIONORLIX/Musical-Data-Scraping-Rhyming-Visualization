A Quiet Life


Transylvania is not England

I know our ways are not your ways

Here, away from everyone

I walk not in the sun

A creature of the shade.



Here the winds breathe through the casements

And the battlements are broken,

I am from another age

A now forgotten age

An age ruled by the blade.



Those days, are gone

It's time to find a new life

I need to feel I'm freed

Freed from the old life

To face a new century unbowed.



How few days make up a century

In my dear new land of England

I shall turn a fresh new page

A life enriching page

This will be my crusade



My friends have all

Passed on, ah my sad country

How strange my life

Will change in your dark London

Where every desire is allowed
