How Do You Choose?


Lucy:

How do you choose?

One of them is brave,

One of them is bright,

One of them is boring.

At the ballet

One of them was sweet,

One of them was smart,

One of them was snoring.



Quincey's accent gives me gooseflesh

Jacks rich voice holds me enthralled



Seward:

Tra la la



Lucy:

Where as Arthur, never opens his mouth at all



Mina:

What's to be done?

Living on a ranch,

Learning how to dance?



Lucy:

Marrying my neighbor?



Mina:

Who do you love?

Which of them is kind?

Which of them is wise?



Lucy:

Isn't this hard labor?

Quincey rides a palomino

Jack saves lives and cuts of frogs

Where as Arthur spends most evenings with his dogs.



Quincey:

Lucy you're perfection, won't you hitch yer wagon to mine?



Seward:

Please, be my companion; turn my surgery into a shrine



Arthur:

There was something I had to say...



Lucy:

Yes, go on...



Arthur:

Oh, never mind.



Mina:

Follow your heart

Do you want ride,

Do you want to stitch?

Do you want to lay low?



Both:

Three different worlds

Galloping the plains,

Comforting the sick



Mina:

Do you need a halo?



Lucy:

Arthur may not be ambitious

Not exciting, wise or tall

But perhaps, I'd be best off with him after all

Truth is, I love him and I always have done



Mina:

Well then follow your heart and be bold.



Lucy:

He's aesthetic, and wise, and kind



Mina:

You'll be together until you grow old



Lucy:

I've been in love with him since we were children



Mina:

Isn't it time the poor fellow was told?



Lucy:

And with him, I feel peace of mind!



The Three Suitors:

How did you choose?



Quincey:

Given that I'm brave?



Seward:

Given that I'm bright?



Arthur:

Given that I'm boring?



Lucy:

Nothing to lose

Following my heart

Opening my mind

Loving and adoring



Company Except Quincey:

Quincey missed it, by a whisker



Company Except Seward:

Jack will take it like a man



Company Except Arthur:

Whereas Arthur was finished before we began!



All:

Love's mysterious, no you can never choose

You're a fool if you think you can ever choose

There's not a hope

Not a chance

Not the minutest opportunity

No one can claim immunity



Lucy:

Not you, not you. You!
