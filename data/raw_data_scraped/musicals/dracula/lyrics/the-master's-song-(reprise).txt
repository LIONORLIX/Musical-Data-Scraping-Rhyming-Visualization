The Master's Song (reprise)


Renfield:

You sailed across the seven seas,

your ship cut through the waves,

and when the crimson moon comes up

you drink the blood of slaves.



Dracula and Renfield:

We have waited long, for the master's song,

and it's time to join in the chorus, sing his song,

sing it loud and strong,



Dracula:

And the master may give you new life.
