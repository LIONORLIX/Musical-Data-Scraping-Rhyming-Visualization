The Master's Song


Renfeild:

Two years ago I was minding my business

Tending my garden at sunrise.

I heard a voice in my head that intrigued me

I answered yes, was I unwise?

Thus it began all the long preparation he needed for his plan

He cannot enter without invitation and I was his man



That's why; I always know what he's thinking.

I always know when he's drinking and from whom,

When he slips in some ones room.

Oh yes, I always know who he's after

I hear his triumphant laughter in my head

When he finds some new well bred, undead.



He sails across the seven seas

His ship cuts through the waves

And when the crimson moon comes up

He drinks the blood of slaves

We have waited long, for the masters song

It's time to join in the chorus

Sing his song sing it loud and strong

And the master may give you new life.



I can't speak of the master

You must understand that all of this is confidential

Take my word for it preparedness is quintessential

I'm ready, I'm ready, and soon I'll be free

I'll be free...



The schooner runs before the storm

The crew is all below

The captain fights to steer a course

The master strikes him so!



Trust me; I always know what he's thinking

I always know where he's sinking those sharp teeth

I know where to send the wreath!

Master, they think a locked door prevents you

You're on your way I can sense you

Through the window, through the grating

Through the floorboard, through the fanlight

Comes the mist. And your kissed!
