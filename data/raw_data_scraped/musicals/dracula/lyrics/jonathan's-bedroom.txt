Jonathan's Bedroom


Harker:

I start to feel that I'm a prisoner here!

Mina, God knows I have just cause for fear

In this curs'ed place!



Will this strange being who exists by night

Let me go free,

Or must I stand and fight?

Will I ever see your face?



No where to hide

No friendly hand

I'm in a spider's web

I twist in vain,

As hope begins to end!



I hear strange voices drifting through the air!

I hear wild laughter, but there's no one there!

I'm under some evil spell!



I'm writing letters to you ev'ry day

But, I have a feeling they're just thrown away!

There's no way that I can tell!
