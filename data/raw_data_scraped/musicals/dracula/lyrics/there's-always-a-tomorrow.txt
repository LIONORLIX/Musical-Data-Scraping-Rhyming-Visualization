There's Always a Tomorrow


Mina

I step across the line for you

I plunge myself in mortal sin

I sacrifice my soul to be your bride

I?ve give in to the feelings I can?t hide

I leap with you  behind

Who cares if love is blind?

The certainty is bliss

At last I know my mind



Mina & Dracula

We?ll live our lives and then

We?ll live them once again

There?s always a tomorrow

There?s always a tomorrow

There?s always one more night



Mina

I hear you befor you speak

I?m with you wherever you are



Dracula

When you sleep I?m in your dreams

I can read your thoughts from afar



The first time I saw your face

I knew I would make you mine

I felt a quickening of the pulse

I felt a shiver down my spine Mina,

you?re the chosen one out of all the loves I?ve known

And all my centuries alone



Mina (overlapping)

(I hear you before speak)

(I?m with you wherever you are)



Mina

Ever since I saw your face

I?ve been trying to deny that I was hopelessly in love

That I could ever say good-bye

Now I know this can?t be done

No I?ll turn away from light

And embrace your endless night



Dracula (Overlapping)

(When you sleep I?m in your dreams)

(I can hear your thoughts from afar)



Dracula

But every time I see your face

I?m tormented by this doubt

Can I deprive you of your death?

Can I condemn you to live without this circle of despair?

Or should I not set you free and let you do the same for me?



Mina

I was born to love you

I was born to need you

These are simple truths that I try to betray



Dracula

If you truly love me

Prove to me you love me

Free me and go back to the beauties of day



I can?t poison your life

I can?t drive you insane

I can?t drag you into my world of bloodlust and pain



My life is no life at all, it is bleak and unforgiving

Feeding on a stranger?s blood

Imprisoned by the night

What?s the use for longing life

When life is not worth living?

If you love me set me free and let me touch the light



Mina

Please don?t make me end this before it?s begun



Dracula

Give me the true nightfall

Give me back to darkness

Give me back my soul

And step into the sun



Both

I was born to love you



Dracula

Lived and died to love you



Both

I was born to love you, and need you, and let you go free
