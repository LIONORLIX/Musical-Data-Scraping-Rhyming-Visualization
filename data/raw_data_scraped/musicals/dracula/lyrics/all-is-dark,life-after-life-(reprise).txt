All Is Dark,Life After Life (reprise)


Dracula:

All is dark;

I hear the sound of water still.



Mina:

I hear the sound of water still,

but water passing through the land.



Dracula:

Cattle low.



Mina:

Cattle low.



Dracula:

Water rushes past my head.



Mina: Water rushes past.

I hear voices but what?s being said is not something I understand.

Something else,

there?s something else I can?t quite hear.



Dracula:

Just let me whisper in your ear,

I?ll be waiting for you.

Always young.



Mina:

Always young.



Dracula:

Imagine staying always young.



Mina:

Always young.



Both: W

hy should we all be born to die.



Dracula:

Let?s leave that to the human race.

Doomed from birth.



Mina:

Doomed from birth.



Both:

We don?t have to go down that road.



Dracula:

We don?t have to shoulder that great load,

it?s nothing something we?ll ever face.



Both:

Clear your mind;

you know there is no right or wrong.



Dracula:

You?re coming here where you belong,

I?ll be waiting for you.



Both:

Life after life,

you won?t need flowers on your grave.

You won?t need prayer,

you have no mortal soul to save.

No one should mourn,

No one should ever shed a tear,

The rewards I am offering

shine brighter than gold.

Life after life.
