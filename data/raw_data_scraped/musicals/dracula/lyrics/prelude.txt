Prelude


Harker:

To think its taken me a mere two weeks

From London`s smoke to these Carpathian peaks

Where night seems so much more dark

What grim adventures lie in wait for me`

It`s far from what one might expect to be

The life of a lawyers Clerk.

I hear the wolves, I see the mist

Cut through the jagged hills

I feel so cold; it`s not the wind that chills...



Have we arrived` Is this...`
