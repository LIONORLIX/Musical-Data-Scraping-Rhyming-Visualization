The Mist


LUCY:

My soul was floating above a moonlit sea

At the same time I was drowning, yet felt somehow free

Enraptured by his eyes the burning eyes of a supreme hypnotist

I followed him into the mist



The dogs were howling, or was it just a dream?

And when he appeared beside me I wanted to scream

But I had lost my voice, I had no choice, I had no will to resist

I drifted away with the mist



There was a singing in my ears

And then he started singing

His voice caressed me through and through

He spoke about all kinds of things

I wish I could remember

But mostly he asked about you



MINA:

Me?



LUCY:

He spoke about you as if he knew you well

Whispering your name and smiling

And casting his spell

The fear and the desire was on fire the ground moved as we kissed



We melted away in

Spent all night and day in

I wish I could stay in

The mist...
