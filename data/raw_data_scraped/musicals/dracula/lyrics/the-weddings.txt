The Weddings


Mina:

That's all in the past

No more fears, to torment us



Mina and Harker:

Now that you and I

Are in each others arms

We'll never say goodbye



Lucy and Arthur:

We are gathered to bring together

Man and woman, husband and wife

To hold and cherish in holy wedlock

Loving devotion till death you both shall part.
