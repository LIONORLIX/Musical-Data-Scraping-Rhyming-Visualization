Over Whitby Bay


Mina:

Staring out to sea

Full of dark premonitions

Thinking what to say

As the sun, slowly dims

Over Whitby bay



Mina and Harker:

On that summer night

When we first shared a carriage

Made our bumpy way

On the road, curving round

Over Whitby Bay

Mina:

We strolled to the old bowling green



Harker:

The orchestra played sweet sixteen



Mina and Harker:

Then we stole our first kiss

My thoughts fly everyday

Back to Whitby Bay



Mina:

Why do I feel cold?

Why am I so frightened?



Harker:

Why did I agree to go so far away!

Will I ever see you again?



Mina:

I'll stare out to sea until then.



Mina and Harker:

We were so happy here

My thoughts turn, everyday

Back to Whitby Bay.



One more lonely night

Full of dark premonitions

Shall we see the day?

When the sun slowly dims

Over Whitby Bay



Dracula:

Mina...

You think, you hear, my voice

It's the beginning

Don't be afraid, for soon

I shall be with you to offer a singular gift
