The Heart Is Slow to Learn


Mina:

Why do we risk all we have, w

hy give into the lure that calls

from everything forbidden.

What attracts us to the night,

and captures us however hard we fight.



It seems the heart is slow to learn, no one can tell it what to do,

it never learns from its mistakes, what twists and turns it puts us through.



Oh yes the heart is slow to learn,

so every lesson is in vain,

it goes the way it wants to go, regardless of the pain.



And so, I foolishly go on,

ignoring all the signs,

dismissing all the doubt inside me.



For the heart is slow to learn,

no one can tell it what to do,

it never learns from its mistakes, that's why it finally breaks

and overpowers you.



Some passions never let you go,

some fires never cease to burn,

it shouldn't come as a surprise

that the heart is slow to learn.



The heart is slow to learn.

The heart is slow to learn.
