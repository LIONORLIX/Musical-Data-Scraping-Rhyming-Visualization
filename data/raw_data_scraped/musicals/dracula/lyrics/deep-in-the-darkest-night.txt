Deep in the Darkest Night


Van helsing:

Now that we`ve found where the enemy`s lurking

Nothing can stand in our way.



Holmwood:

Since we are facing the forces of darkness,

We must be the cold light of day.



Morris:

We are the lanterns that burn in the lighthouse.



Holmwood:

The candles in the crypt.



Seward:

We are the light.



All:

Let there be light.



Van helsing:

This is a war and we must be the victors.



Holmwood:

There`s too much too lose if we fail.



Seward: we`ll cross the seas like a band of crusaders,

Searching for some precious grail.



Morris:

We are the embers that glow in the winter,

The diamonds in the mine.



Holmwood:

Let`s take our torches

And pray god will show us a sign.



All:

Deep in the darkest night,

When there`s no spark of hope,

We must be points of light

Piercing the darkness.

Bright as the dazzling stars

In an indifferent sky

And in our cruelest hour when hope is gone,

We`ll raise our heads

And we`ll journey on.



Holmwood:

When the great battle commences,

Surely the light will prevail.

We will break down his defenses,

He will fall and the sun will rise.



All:

Deep in the darkest night,

When there`s no spark of hope,

We must be points of light

Piercing the darkness.

Bright as the dazzling stars

In an indifferent sky a

Nd in our cruelest hour

When hope is gone,

We`ll raise our heads

And we`ll journey on.
