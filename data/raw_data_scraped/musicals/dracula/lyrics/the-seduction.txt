The Seduction


Dracula :

(speaking)

If you were not your husband's, he would be a dead man.



(singing)

Ever since I saw you,

Shivers down my spine

You're the one,

You're the chosen one

I'm here to make you mine...



You're the one

Out of all the loves I've known

All my centuries alone

You are the flesh of my flesh,

For all time



I've commanded armies

I've defeated kings

But today,

Seeing you this way

Armies and kings

Seem trivial things

Empty, and trivial things



Mina:

Please don't make me love you

Please don't make me need you

You know very well I can't turn you away

I can feel the nightfall

I embrace your darkness

But must I give up all the beauties of day?



Dracula:

Pure pleasure,

For infinity

Why should we all be born to die?

I offer you my love

Eternal love

A love unchanging as the stars above



Dracula & Mina:

My blood will be your blood

My bed will be your bed

Together we will pass

The centuries ahead

And when the world's grown old

Our gold will still be gold



Dracula:

There's always a tomorrow



Mina:

I know the mist is closing in

And I am losing all control



Dracula:

You have the light of passion in your eyes

A look that nothing spoken can disguise

It tells me that you feel the things you want to feel

Your body wants me now

Some things you can't conceal

We'll live our lives and then

We'll live them once again

There's always a tomorrow



Dracula & Mina:

There's always a tomorrow

There's always one more night



(INTERLUDE)



Dracula & Mina:

How can we turn back

When we have come so far?

Any sacrifice is worth it

To be where you are

(You) I had (me) you in (your) my hold

I have to fall

But who could ever resist?

We're melting away in

And we'll always stay in

Together, we'll stay in

The mist
