All You Wanna Do


[Ensemble:]

All you wanna do

All you wanna do, baby



[Katherine Howard:]

I think we can all agree

I'm the ten amongst these threes



[Ensemble:]

All you wanna do

All you wanna do, baby



[Katherine Howard:]

And ever since I was a child

I'd make the boys go wild



[Ensemble:]

All you wanna do

All you wanna do, baby



[Katherine Howard:]

Take my first music teacher

Henry Manox

I was young, it's true

But even then I knew



The only thing you wanna do is...



Broad, dark, sexy Manox

Taught me all about dynamics

He was twenty three

And I was thirteen

Going on thirty



We spent hours strumming the lute

Striking the chords and blowing the flute

He plucked my strings all the way to G

Went from major to minor

C to D



Tell me what you need

What you want

You don't need to plead

'Cause I feel

The chemistry

Like I get you

And you get me and



Maybe this is it

He just cares so much

It feels legit

We have a connection

I think this guy is different



'Cause

All you wanna do

All you wanna do, baby's

Touch me, love me

Can't get enough, see



All you wanna do

All you wanna do, baby's

Please me, squeeze me

Birds and the bees me



Run your fingers through my hair

Tell me I'm the fairest of the fair



Playtime's over

The only thing you wanna do is



But then there was another guy, Francis Dereham



Serious, stern and slow

Gets what he wants and he won't take no

Passion in all that he touches

The sexy secretary to the dowager duchess



Helped him in his office had a duty to fulfill

He even let me use his favourite quill

Spilled ink all over the parchment

My wrist was so tired

Still I came back the next day

As he required



You see, I'm all you need

All you want, you don't need to plead

'Cause I feel the chemistry

Like I get you and you get me and



I know, this is it

He just cares so much

This one's legit

We have a real connection

I'm sure this time is different



'Cause

All you wanna do

All you wanna do, baby's

Touch me, love me

Can't get enough, see



All you wanna do

All you wanna do, baby's

Please me, squeeze me

Birds and the bees me



You can't wait a second more

To get my corset on the floor



Playtime's over

The only thing you wanna do is...



Yeah, that didn't work out

So I decided to have a break from boys

And you'll never guess who I met



Tall, large, Henry the Eighth

Supreme head of the Church of England



Globally revered

Although you wouldn't know it from the look of that beard



Made me a lady in waiting, hurled

Me and my family up in the world

Gave me duties in court and he swears it's true

That without me he doesn't know what he'd do



You see, I'm all you need

All you want, we both agree

This is the place for me

I'm finally where I'm meant to be



Then he starts saying all this stuff

He cares so much, he calls me 'love'

He says we have this connection

I guess it's not so different



'Cause

All you wanna do

All you wanna do, baby's

Touch me, love me

Can't get enough, see



All you wanna do

All you wanna do, baby's

Seize me, squeeze me

Birds and the bees me



There's no time for when or how

'Cause you've just got to have me now



Playtime's over

The only thing you wanna do is...



So we got married. Woo



With Henry, it isn't easy

His temper's short and his mates are sleazy

Except for this one courtier

He's a really nice guy just

So sincere



The royal life isn't what I planned

But Thomas is there to lend a helping hand

So sweet, makes sure that I'm okay

And we hang out loads when the King's away



This guy, finally

Is what I want, the friend I need

Just mates, no chemistry

I get him and he gets me



And there's nothing more to it

He just cares so much, he's devoted

He says we have a connection



I thought this time was different

Why did I think he'd be different

But it's never, ever different



'Cause

All you wanna do

All you wanna do, baby's

Touch me, when will

Enough be enough, see?



All you wanna do

All you wanna do, baby's

Squeeze me, don't care

If you don't please me



Bite my lip and pull my hair

As you tell me I'm the fairest of the fair



[Ensemble:]

Playtime's over

Playtime's over



[Katherine Howard & Ensemble:]

Playtime's over



[Ensemble:]

The only thing

The only thing



[Katherine Howard:]

The only thing you wanna do is...
