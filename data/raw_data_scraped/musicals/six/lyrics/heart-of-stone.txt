Heart of Stone


[Jane Seymour:]

You've got a good heart

But I know it changes

A restless tide, untameable

You came my way

And I knew a storm could come too

You'd lift me high, or let me fall



But I took your hand

Promised I'd withstand

Any blaze you blew my way

'Cause something inside

It solidified

And I knew I'd always stay



You can build me up

You can tear me down

You can try but I'm unbreakable

You can do your best

But I'll stand the test

You'll find that I'm unshakable

When the fire's burnt

When the wind has blown

When the water's dried

You'll still find stone

My heart of stone



You say we're perfect

A perfect family

You hold us close for the world to see

And when I say you're the only one I've ever loved

I mean those words truthfully



But I know, without my son

Your love could disappear

And though it isn't fair

But I don't care

'Cause my love will still be here



You can build me up

You can tear me down

You can try but I'm unbreakable

You can do your best

But I'll stand the test

You'll find that I'm unshakable

When the fire's burnt

When the wind has blown

When the water's dried

You'll still find stone

My heart of stone



Soon I'll have to go

I'll never see him grow

But I hope my son will know

He'll never be alone

'Cause like a river runs dry

And leaves its scars behind

I'll be by your side

'Cause my love is set in stone



Yeah



[All:]

You can build me up

You can tear me down

You can try but I'm unbreakable

You can do your best

But I'll stand the test

You'll find that I'm unshakable

The fire's burnt

The wind has blown

The water's dried



[Jane Seymour:]

You'll still find stone

My heart of stone



[All:]

You can build me up

You can tear me down

You can try but I'm unbreakable

You can do your best

But I'll stand the test

You'll find that I'm unshakable

The fire's burnt

The wind has blown

The water's dried



[Jane Seymour:]

You'll still find stone

My heart of stone
