Haus of Holbein


Welcome to the house

To the Haus of Holbein

Ja, ooh ja, das ist gut

Ooh ja, ja

The Haus of Holbein



Hans Holbein goes around the world

Painting all of the beautiful girls

From Spain, to France

And Germany

The king chooses one

But which one will it be?



You bring the corsets

We'll bring the cinches

No one wants a waist over nine inches

So what the make up contains lead poison?

At least your complexion will bring all the boys in



Ignore the fear and you'll be fine

We'll turn this vier into a nine

So just say 'ja' and don't say 'nein'



'Cause now you're in the house

In the Haus of Holbein!

Ja, ooh ja, das ist gut

Ooh ja, ja

The Haus of Holbein



We must make sure the princesses look great

When their time comes for the Holbein portrait

We know what all the best inventions are

To hold everything up

Ja, it's wunderbar



For blonder hair, then you just add a

Magical ingredient from your bladder

Try these heels, so high it's naughty

But we cannot guarantee that you'll still walk at forty



Ignore the fear and you'll be fine

We'll turn this vier into a nine

So just say 'ja' and don't say 'nein'



'Cause now you're in the house

In the Haus of Holbein!



Ooh ja, das ist gut

Ooh ja, ja

The Haus of Holbein
