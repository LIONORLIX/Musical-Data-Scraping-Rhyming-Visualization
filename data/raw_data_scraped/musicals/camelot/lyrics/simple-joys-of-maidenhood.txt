Simple Joys of Maidenhood


GUENEVERE:

St. Genevieve, St. Genevieve,

It's Guenevere!

Remember me?

St. Genevieve, St. Genevieve,

I'm over here

Beneath this tree.

You know how faithful and devout I am,

You must admit I've always been a lamb,

But Genevieve, St. Genevieve--

I won't obey you anymore.

You've gone a bit too far!

I won't be bid and bargained for

Like beads at a bazaar.

St. Genevieve, I've run away,

Eluded them and fled,

And from now on, I intend to pray

To someone else instead!

Oh Genevieve, St. Genevieve,

Where were you when my youth was sold?

Dear Genevieve, sweet Genevieve,

Shan't I be young before I'm old?



Where are the simple joys of maidenhood?

Where are all those adoring, daring boys?

Where's the youth pining so for me

He leaps to death in woe for me?

Oh, where are a maiden's simple joys?

Shan't I have the normal life a maiden should?

Shall I never be rescued in the wood?

Shall two knights never tilt for me

And let their blood be spilt for me?

Oh, where are the simple joys of maidenhood?

Shall I not be on a pedestal,

Worshipped and competed for?

Not be carried off, or better still,

Cause a little war?

Where are the simple joys of maidenhood?

Are those dear gentle pleasures gone for good?

Shall a feud not begin for me?

Shall kith not kill their kin for me?

Oh, where are the trivial joys,

Harmless convivial joys,

Where are the simple joys of maidenhood?
