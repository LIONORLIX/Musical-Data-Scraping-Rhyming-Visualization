Before I Gaze at You Again


Before I gaze at you again

I'll need a time for tears.

Before I gaze at you again

Let hours turn to years.



I have so much forgetting to do

Before I try to gaze again at you.



Stay away until you cross my mind

Barely once a day.

Stay away until I wake and find

That I can smile and say:



That I shall gaze at you again

Without a blush or qualm.

My eyes will shine like new again,

My manner poised and calm.



No sign of fear,

Not even a sigh.

And so till when

We gaze again, Goodbye!

Goodbye!

Goodbye!
