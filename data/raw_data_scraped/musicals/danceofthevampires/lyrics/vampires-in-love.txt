Vampires In Love


Sarah:

Hello? Hello mr von krolock? I've lost my way, are you there?



(turn around…)



Sarah:

Every now and then i get a little bit lonely

And i don't know what i miss



(turn around…)



Every now and then i get a little bit anxious

And i wonder what it is i desire



(turn around…)



Every now and then i get a little bit nervous

That the time of waiting will never end



(turn around…)



Every now and then i get a little bit terrified

And drawn by something i can't withstand



(turn around, bright eyes…)



Every now and then, i hear a voice



(turn around, bright eyes…)



Every now and then, i hear…



(turn around…)



Every now and then i get a little bit restless

And i dream of something wild



(turn around…)



Every now and then i get a little helpless

And i'm longing like a child to be loved



(turn around…)



Every now and then i get a little bit curious

What it's like to be a woman and free



(turn around…)



Every now and then i get a little bit terrified

Of all the hazards waiting for me



(turn around, bright eyes…)



Every now and then, i hear a voice



(turn around, bright eyes…)



Every now and then, i hear a voice



Krolock appears atop the staircase. As he descends the candles light.



Krolock:

Turn around, this is the night

Now i need you more than ever

And if you'll only hold me tight

We'll be holding on forever

And we'll only be making it right

Cause we'll never be wrong

Together we can take it to the end of the line

My love is like a shadow on you all of the time



I don't know what to do

And i'm always in the dark

Sarah:

I feel it like a powder keg awaiting the spark

Both:

I really need you tonight

Forever's gonna start tonight

Forever's gonna start tonight



Sarah:

Once upon a time i dreamed of falling in love

Now i'm scared of falling apart

Krolock:

There's nothing you can do

A total eclipse of the heart



(turn around…)



Sarah:

Every now and then i think i'd better run away from you

Before it's too late



(turn around…)



Both:

But every now and then i know i/you must go where i/you lead me/you

You'll/i'll go with you/me through the gates of hell



Sarah:

Every now and then i know there's no one in the universe

As magical and wond'rous as you



Both:

Every now and then i know there's nothing any better

And there's nothing that i just wouldn't do



(turn around, bright eyes…)



Sarah:

Every now and then i hear a voice



(turn around, bright eyes…)



Both:

Now you know i never had a choice



And i need you now tonight

And i need you more than ever

And if you'll only hold me tight

We'll be holding on forever

And we'll only be making it right

Cause we'll never be wrong

Together we can take it to the end of the line

My love is like a shadow on you all of the time



Krolock:

I don't know what to do

And i'm always in the dark

Sarah:

I feel it like a powder keg awaiting the spark

Both:

I really you need you tonight

Forever's gonna start tonight

Forever's gonna start tonight



Sarah:

Once i dreamed of falling in love

Now i'm scared of falling apart

Krolock:

There's nothing you can do

A total eclipse of the heart

Once upon a time, life was simple and bright

Sarah:

Now there's only layers of dark

Both:

There's nothing you can do

A total eclipse of the heart

Krolock:

There's nothing you can do

Sarah:

A total eclipse of the heart

Krolock:

No! No! Tonight, at the ball!

Sarah:

There's nothing i can do

A total eclipse of the heart
