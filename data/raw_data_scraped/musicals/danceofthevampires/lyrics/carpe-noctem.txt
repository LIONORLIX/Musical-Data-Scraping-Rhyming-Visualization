Carpe Noctem


A mysterious voice:

Come with me and bless the night

Let the darkness be your salvation

Curse the day escape the light

Break the chains of imagination



Come with me and seize the night

Now's the time for some inspiration

Leave the day and loose the night

No taboo's only new sensations



In the shadows of the castle

A hero's waiting for the call

And all the devils are waking up

And all the angels start to fall



In the shadows of the castle

They're dying for a thrill

They're going out over the edge

They're moving in for the kill



You gotta curse the day

Its nothing but a merciless light

So open up your arms

And get down on your knees

Suck in all the darkness

And your ready now to seize

Seize the night

Seize the night



Bless the night

Before it has a chance to pass

Seize the night

You do what it takes to make it last



Bless the night

Seize the night

Seize the night right now



Let your dreams out of there cages

Every passion and desire

Let your visions be outrageous

Set your fantasies on fire



Everything will be permitted

There will be nothing left to fear

I've got the magic in your body

Your inhibitions disappear



You gotta curse the day

Its nothing but a merciless light

So open up your arms

And get down on your knees

Suck in all the darkness

And your ready now to seize

Seize the night

Seize the night



Bless the night

Before it has a chance to pass

Seize the night

You do what it takes to make it lastâ€¦
