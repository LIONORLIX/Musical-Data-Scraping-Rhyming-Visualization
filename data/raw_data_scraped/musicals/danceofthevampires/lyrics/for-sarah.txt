For Sarah


There are ghosts in the air,

evil eyes in the darkness

as I search for Sarah



Demons lurk everywhere,

but however much they scare me

I will not be deterred



I'll be tough,

I'll be sly,

There is nothing I would not do or be

for Sarah



I will steal,

I will lie

There is nothing I won't try

to find and save her



There's a dream

there's song

how I long to go back

but I must stay

for Sarah



Through this nightmares I go

Desperate, shattered

lonely but I must not be far

I will slash

I will burn

There's nothing I would not do or be

for Sarah



There's no stone I won't turn

I'd do anything it takes to find and hold her



I'll be bold,

I'll be brave

There is nothing I would not be for you

For Sarah



I would go to the grave,

like a sacrificial angel

I will not let you fall



I will fight all my fears,

There is nothing I would not do for you

Oh Sarah



Take this blood sweating tears.

Take this sacrificial angel

who will save you

Sarah!
