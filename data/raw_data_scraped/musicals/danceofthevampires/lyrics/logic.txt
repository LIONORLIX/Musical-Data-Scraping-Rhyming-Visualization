Logic


You think i haven't got a clue

Your cringing makes me weary

Its time i introduce to you

My fundamental theory

Logic, logic

The world is based on logic



When i was but a little boy

A sitting on my mammas knee

A visionary thought i got

As pure as trigonometry

Logic logic

The answer is logic



So to heidelberg i travelled

At the tender age of seven

All my courses i unravelled

By the time i turned eleven

Using logic (logic)

I became petagogic



My thinking's clear my visions firm

Illusions can't delude me

This early bird will catch his worm

You simply can't elude me

Put me to the test

And you will find

You can't mess

With this professors mind



With a logic unmistakable irrational reality

Your stubbornness i'll shake and break your confidentiality

My skill is unsurpassable

My thinking truly awesome

Yet i do become irascible

With people playing possum like you do



I was sticking out my neck

With such impeccable detection

While deflecting all the threat

That you direct in my direction

I came all the way from heidelburg

To undertake my final quest

To save your suicidal burg

I'll do my level-headed best for you



You may be a simple pigeon

But you'd fly like a toboggan

If you only had a smidgeon

Of the knowledge in my noggin.

Now you lose this simply query

When i execute this high kick

I'll elucidate this theory

With a logic almost psychic like i do

To detect the undetectable

Is what you can expect from me

Dissecting the respectable

Just like an appendectomy

My brain is like a razor

Contemplating the confusion

Ripping deep into the haze

And wide polluting the delusion this is true!



All:

Always thinking rather logical to cause a revolution

He won't give a damn, no not one bit about your revolution

And his theory is so radical

And certain so far reaching that a permanent sabbatical

For preaching what he's teaching



Our professor is the pips

Shooting from the hips

So we need to get a grip

For letting people dip

This song sure is a pain

Are we going all insane

And we never will change what's logically true
