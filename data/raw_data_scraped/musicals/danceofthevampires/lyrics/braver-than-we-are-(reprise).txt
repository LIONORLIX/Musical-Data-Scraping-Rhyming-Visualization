Braver Than We Are (Reprise)


Alfred:

We've survived the dread

Now i keep you in my arms

Till the morning sunshine melts our fears away

Good love can't go bad

There is nothing that can harm us

Having battled through the night

We will win the day

I'll be yours and you'll be mine

Never out of love

Never out of mind

What a lovely start

What a way to end

We will never part

Beyond the forest over the hollow

I know a place so peaceful and joyous

Lead me, i'll follow



Now we can fly like the angels in the sacred air

Higher and higher above the world and all its cares

Everybody's ready to fly

But the storms never so very far

Our lives are shining like a star

And salvations never very far

Salvations never very far



Now we can be

So much braver than we ever are

Now we can fly…



Alfred (looking at something on his hand):

What's this?

Sarah:

Blood, dear. Lick it up



He does.



Alfred:

It's not bad…
