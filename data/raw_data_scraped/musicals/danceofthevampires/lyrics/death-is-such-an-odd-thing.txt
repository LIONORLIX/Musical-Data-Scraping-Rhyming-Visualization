Death Is Such An Odd Thing


Rebecca:

He was my master

He was my lord

Now ever after, he's stiffer than a board

Death is such an odd thing

Death is such an odd thing



Magda:

When he came near me

He groped and he clutched

Now, i can touch him without being touched

Death is such an odd thing



Both:

Death is such an odd thing

When he lived, there was repulsion

Pure disgust and then revulsion

But as a corpse he's calm and coy

Like a little sleeping boy



Magda:

Isn't it funny?

Maybe its not

But he's so frigid

And he used to be so hot

Death is such an odd thing

Both: death is such an odd thing



Rebecca:

It's so ironic

Magda:

It's so ironic

Rebecca:

Totally droll

Magda:

Totally droll

Rebecca:

He used to use me

Magda:

He used to use me

Rebecca:

Now i'm in control

Magda:

Now i'm in control

Rebecca:

Death is such an odd thing

Magda:

Death is such an odd thing

Both:

Death is such an odd thing

When he lived, he was offensive

His libido was entrancing

Rebecca:

As a corpse he's soft and fat

Magda:

Like a fine aristocrat (ow!)

Both:

Isn't it senseless?

Fills you with fear

We'll go on living

But he'll never be here

Death is such an odd thing

Death is such an odd thing

Death is such an odd thing
