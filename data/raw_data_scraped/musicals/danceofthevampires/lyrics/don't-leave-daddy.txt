Don't Leave Daddy


When a man has got a pretty daughter

Then his life is pretty filled with pain

Cause she never does the things he taught her

It's enough to drive a man insane

It's a pity that i must conceal you

Though you're lovely as a budding rose

But there's always someone out to steal you

You can't see them but your father knows



Sleep my little darling

Dream my tender starling

No one must awake you

No one must a take you

You're not ready

I'm not ready

We're not ready

Don't leave daddy



Now you're looking forward to your birthday

You still think that it is fun to grow

But to me your birthday is a curse day

Cause it means you're old enough to go



Sleep my sweet confection

Papa's your protection

No one must confuse you

No one will abuse you

I'm not ready

You're not ready

No one's ready

Don't leave daddyâ€¦
