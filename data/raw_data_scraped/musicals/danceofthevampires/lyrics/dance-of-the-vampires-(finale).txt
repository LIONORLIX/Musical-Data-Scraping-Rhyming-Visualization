Dance Of The Vampires (Finale)


Sarah:

I've got a dream that a vampire in a castle

Is dying and is dust in the wind

But his vision won't be ended

And it's coming to pass

That a new world is about to begin



I've got a dream that a boy in a castle

Who would die just to save me from sin

So young and beautiful and innocent too

He knew that in the end

'Twas i have saved him



But i don't see any vampires in the cities

I don't hear the unholy choir sing

And if i can't get a vampire i can still get a boy

And a boy will be the next best thing

A bite away from the future

A boy will be the next best thing…



Vampires:

Go break a heart or your heart will be broken

Go betray your friend or else be betrayed

Grab your chance before it's too late

If you're fighting, you must not be afraid



Better to badder, defend or be beaten

Use your elbows or get jostled yourself

Better to eat than to find you've been eaten

No one cares for you so care for yourself



Now our life in the darkness is over

And we're dancing in the rings of the sun

We are sure of our goals

And know what path we must take

We don't live

We don't die

But we are wide awake

We are in motion

And the soon the world will be won



Before you know it's begun

So all of you out there watch out!

Now we're gonna advance, watch out!

We've got the world in our hands — watch out!

You're gonna see the vampires dance

You're gonna see the vampires dance



Let the revels begin

Let the fires be started

We're dancing for the restless and the steely hearted

Let the devils come in

Let the fires be started

We're dancing for the restless and the phoney hearted



Say a prayer in the darkness

For the magic to come

No matter what it seems

Tonight is what it means to be young

Tonight is what it means to be young

Before you know it's gone



We've got a dream that the darkness is over

And we're dancing in the rings of the sun

But it's only a dream but tonight is for real

You'll never know what means

But you know how it feels



We are in motion

And the soon the world will be won

Before you know it's begun

It's all we really got

Tonight

Now we're crying for blood

Tonight

Before you know it's gone

Tonight



Tonight is what it means to be young

Tonight is what it means to be young



Let the revels begin

Let the fires be started

We're dancing for the restless and the steely hearted

Let the devils come in

Let the fires be started

We're dancing for the restless and the phoney hearted

You're gonna see the vampires dance

We've got the world in our hands



Say a prayer in the darkness

For all the magic to come

No matter what it seems

Tonight is what it means to be young

You're gonna see the vampires dance

Tonight is what it means to be young

Before you know it's begun



We drink your blood and then we eat your soul

Nothing's gonna stop us, let the bad times roll



We drink your blood

And then we eat your soul

Nothing's gonna stop us

Let the bad times roll



You're gonna see the vampires dance…
