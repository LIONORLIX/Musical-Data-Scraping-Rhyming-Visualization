When Love Is Inside You


Herbert:

Read a page. See if it doesn't move you



When love is inside you

Don't ever be afraid

Just let your heart guide you

You're fears will be allayed



For the one you adore

Just cannot ignore

The light in your eyes

That light signifies

Love is inside you

And now it starts to rise



Don't be to shy to let your romance begin

When passions ignite you, you cannot lock them in

Show the one you admire that you are on fire

Then chase away any kind of doubt

When love is inside you, you've got to let it out



You must not be frightened

Dear friend i'm on your side

You blush can it be that you're ill?

I'm not ill, i don't blush

Yes you do, you're dishevelled and flush



You must get some rest now

Right here on my breast now

You shake, can it be that you are scared?

I'm not scared, i don't shake

Yes you do, i'm concerned for your sake



Alfred : isn't there some kind of happening tonight?

Herbert: you are such a ravishing sight

Alfred : i'm not

Herbert: beautiful lashes

Alfred : my lashes?

Herbert: phenomenal

They look like wonderful threads of gold



We'll have a glorious time tonight

Handcuffs and wine and candlelight

And we'll be dancing, romancing

My innermost dreams will come true

When i'm deep into you



What is it you're feeling?

Confused, it must be me

Your banana is peeling

You are in love i see

Ah yes, well i'm in love too

In love with guess who?

Yes alfred with you



When love is inside you

You've got to let it

Let it out
