Come With Me


Krolock:

Come with me and bless the night

Let the darkness be your salvation

Curse the day, escape the light

Break the chains of imagination



Come with me and you'll know love

We will show you and we will teach you

Take my hand and learn from us

We will touch you and we will reach you

And you will live forever

You will live forevermore

Forevermoreâ€¦
