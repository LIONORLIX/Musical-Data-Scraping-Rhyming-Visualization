Death Is Such An Odd Thing - Reprise


Rebecca:

I think soâ€¦ that was amazing!



All those years of endless boredom

We did nothing, we endured them



Who knew death could be this hot?



Who would of noticed?

It takes away your breath

The answer to the question

Is there sex after death?



Death is such an odd thing

Death is such an odd thing
