Braver Than We Are/Red Boots Ballet/Say A Prayer


BRAVER THAN WE ARE:



Alfred:

I will never sleep, every night i'll be with you

There is so much on your mind that i don't know

Feels like i'm on fire, and the flames have got no mercy

The fevers never ending all it seems to do is grow



Sarah:

There are times i want to run

Times i want to hide

Things i've left undone

Things i cast aside

So many things to try

So many things denied

Alfred:

There's no denying

Sarah:

Sooner or later, i wanted to run now

Sooner or later, it's finally come now

How can we fly

Like the angels in the sacred air

Higher and higher

Above the world and all its cares



Alfred:

Everybody's ready to fly

But the storms are never so very far

And i wish my life was shining like a star

But the fears are never very far

And we always seem so much braver than we are

We always dream we'd be braver but we never are



Sarah:

I need so much

Alfred:

I need your touch

Sarah:

I am sick of this place and this cold

I don't want to get old without living

I am tired doing just what i'm told

I want more than what anyone's giving

Alfred:

I've waited forever for now

Sarah:

And i need to go fast; show me how

Alfred:

So many days have been lost

Sarah:

And we've both paid the cost

Alfred:

There's nothing to be sorry for

Sarah:

Now we can have so much more

Alfred:

Now i can be close to you

Sarah:

Nothing we are scared to do



We always seem so much braver than we ever are

We always dream we'd be braver than we ever are

Let's run away, go too far



RED BOOTS BALLET:



Sarah:

I will never sleep

Now my heart has been awakened

I feel the yearning

For a single perfect touch

I can't afford to wait

Or the magic will be taken

I don't want to lose;

There can never be too much



There are times i want to run

Times i want to hide

Things i've left undone

Things i cast aside

So many things to try

So many things denied

And now i know it's sooner or later

I wanted a chance now

Sooner or later is here

I can dance now



Weightlessly free

I'll be reborn if i only dare

They'll be no more boundaries anywhere

Krolock's voice:

Do what they will never permit

And don't ask if you'll regret it tomorrow

Sarah:

My life is finally shining like a star

I can leave those fears right were they are

Leave those fears right where they are now

Krolock's voice & sarah:

How can we fly like the night birds in the darkest air

Higher and higher above the world and all its cares

We run away

Sarah:

Away from here



SAY A PRAYER:



When temptation comes to call

The soul can lose its way

And the angels start to fall

Only prayer can save the day



Say a prayer for those who crawl

Say a prayer for those who run

Say a prayer so after all

There's a better life to come



Say a prayer for those alone

Say a prayer for those apart

All those hungry boys and girls

They're crusaders of the heart



Say a prayer for all the lost

Say a prayer for the unborn

Say a prayer for all the young

It takes a fire to keep them warm



Say a prayer for those obsessed

Say a prayer for those enslaved

Say a prayer for they'll be strong

From the cradle to the grave



Say a prayer for all the saints

Say a prayer for all the sins

Let the dancing never end

Let the future now begin



Say a prayer to all the gods

Some are near and some are far

Say a prayer to all the gods

Make us braver than we are
