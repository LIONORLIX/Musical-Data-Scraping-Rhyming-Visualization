Original Sin


I`ve been looking for an original sin

One with a twist and a bit of a spin

And since I`ve done all the old ones

Till they`ve all been done in

Now I`m just looking then I`m gone with the wind

Endlessly searching for an original sin

I`ve waiting for you

since you`ve been born

I`d watch you secretly

but not for long

And since I know all your dreams

I understand what you need

And when I call you

you must go where I lead

Your dreams are so hungry

it`s time now feed

So I bless you with my curse

And encourage your endeavour

You`ll be better when you`re worse

You must die to live forever

I will show you the depths of the night

We can never go wrong

Together we can take it

to the end of the line

My eyes are like a shadow

on you all of the time

And since I know all your dreams

I understand what you need

And when I call you

you must go where I lead

Your dreams are so hungry

it`s time now to feed
