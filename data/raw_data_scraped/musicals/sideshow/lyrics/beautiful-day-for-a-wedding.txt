Beautiful Day For A Wedding


The Boss:

Love

We love stories of love and romance

Love created in song and in dance

Any reminder there's always a chance

Love could transform our lives

Love, love

Tickets, tickets

Right this way

Wedding show today

Wedding, wedding

Right this way

See the show today

See the groom

See the bride

See her sister

By her side



The Boss & Hawkers:

See them wed

After noon

See who'll share their honeymoon

Here, right here

Get a wedding souvenir

Remember this day

Remember this freak show

With a wedding momento

In honor of the twins

Double hot dogs joined in a bun

Get 'em hot

Two for one



Hawker:

I've got the best

You only have to ask

Get a two-headed twin mask



The Boss:

What a beautiful day for a wedding

What an event to view

What a story to tell your children

'Cause next to the day

You became man and wife

You'll remember this wedding for the rest of your life

Love

We love stories of love and romance

Love created in song and in dance

Any reminder there's always a chance

Love could transform our lives

Love, love



Jake goes to see Daisy and Violet before the ceremony...



Jake:

Violet, I always knew

You'd make a beautiful bride



Violet:

Thank you, Jake

You're very kind



Jake:

I've made up my mind

I'm leaving



Violet:

Leaving?



Daisy:

For where?



Jake:

A friend had a place in Chicago

Serving blues late into the night

Wants me to help with performers

Thanks to you

I think I'll do alright

Why not go



Daisy:

But we need you



Violet:

Don't leave now



Jake:

No, Violet, no

I have to say no to you



Daisy:

Jake, you're the only one who always cared



Violet:

Thank you for the love you shared



Jake:

We were good for each other

All the way around

You will fare well



Buddy and Terry enter...



Terry:

Happy wedding day



Buddy:

What a crowd out there



Violet:

Buddy, go away

Bad luck if you see me today



Terry:

Old wives tales don't apply



Violet:

Get out, Buddy

Goodbye



Terry:

Is something wrong?



Daisy:

Jake's leaving



Violet:

He's got a job in Chicago



Terry:

Jake's not going anywhere



Jake:

This doesn't concern you



Terry:

What concerns them concerns me



Jake:

You only care how big headlines will be



Terry:

I don't need this

Go ahead, leave

Good riddance



Jake:

When I'm good and ready



Terry:

Your timing is lousy



Jake:

I don't play by your script



Terry:

Then go, Jake



Jake:

Don't tell me what to do



Terry:

I call the shots here



Jake:

Not anymore



Violet:

Stop it, you two

Not on my wedding day



Jake:

I'm sorry.

Buddy, you be good to Violet.

She deserves better.



Buddy:

Hey, now wait just a minute...



Jake:

I'm waiting for you to tell the truth!



Terry:

Get out of here.



Jake:

If you hurt her

I will hunt you down



Jake leaves...



Terry:

What was that all about?



Daisy:

He loves her

He truly does



Terry:

What?



Buddy:

He's right, Violet

You deserve better



Terry:

Buddy...



Buddy:

I've tried

But I'm playing a part

I've tried

And it's breaking my heart



Violet:

You don't love me?



Buddy:

I do, Violet

But not the way you want

I'm not that strong of a man



Violet:

But you're the man I love



Buddy:

You should be loved

By someone like Jake

Somebody strong

Who's able to take

Whatever comes along

Sharing life with two

Is more than I can do

If only I'd known it before

Loving you is more than I bargained for



Terry:

Come on, Buddy.

You get a hold of yourself.



Buddy:

I have!



Terry:

Daisy, talk to him!

God damn it, this wedding is going to happen!



While all of this is going on, a man suddenly interrupts...



Tod Browning:

Excuse me.



Terry:

No one is allowed back here!



Browning:

Terry Connor?



Terry:

What?



Browning:

Tod Browning, from MGM.



Terry:

Mr. Browning...



Daisy:

The movie director?



Browning:

You must be the Hilton sisters.

Lovely, lovely.



Buddy:

I'm Buddy Foster.

I'm the groom.



Violet:

No you're not!

No you're not!

The wedding's off.



Terry:

Violet...



Browning:

Did I understand you correctly?



Violet:

Yes, you did.



Browning:

That's a shame!

I came all the way from Hollywood.

I intended to offer you roles in my new film.



Daisy:

Oh, well we can still be in your film!



Browning:

I don't know, without the publicity from the wedding.
