We Share Everything




Archeologists:

We've traveled from Nome to Bali

Seen the history of human folly

Courted danger til our hair was curled

Seen all seven wonders of the world

Those wonders have mostly crumbled

Built by people - Down they tumbled

Wonders made by nature never rust

But those made by humans turn to dust

While all seven wonders deteriorate

Our new discovery is right up to date

This is a wonder you can't duplicate

Clean the slate

Here's the great

Number eight



Daisy & Violet:

Life's ducky

Balmy weather

We're lucky

We're together

We're a pair remarkably mated

People swear we must be related

We can't bear to be separated

We share everything

Two songbirds

Zero friction

No strong words

Dainty diction

Harmony is what we always sing

We're so happy we share everything

Ain't is amazin'?

Even our phrasin'

Sounds like it's coming from one

Nobody's sweating

When we're dueting

Cause we're having such fun

Even more when we go dancing



Daisy:

You should hear the roar



Violet:

When we hit the floor



Daisy:

We're so closely matched



Violet:

Never unattached



Daisy & Violet:

Life's breezy

No dissension

Life's easy

Without tension

We're like bees who never need to sting

We're so happy sharing the honey

We're so happy sharing the money

We're so happy we share everything



They dance...



Daisy & Violet:

We're so happy we share everything



Violet:

Never division

On any decision

Never a word that's severe



Daisy:

Two different voices

Identical choices

Never an arguement here



Daisy & Violet:

We're both sweet and understanding

We divide the pie

We see eye to eye

We're never pushy shovey

Forever lovey dovey

All through summer, winter, fall or spring

We're united through every season

We're delighted you know the reason

You can share, too

There's nothing to it

So prepare to watch how we do it



A group of men dressed as Pharaohs come and dance with them...



Pharaohs:

Even more when we go dancing



Daisy & Violet:

You should hear the roar

When we hit the floor

Come on, boys

Build a barge

Make it fancy

Make it large

Grab an oar

Row with style

Take us down the Nile

We're so happy we share everything



Pharaohs:

We're so happy

We're so happy

We're so happy



All:

We share everything



The Pharaohs leave the stage singing...



Pharaohs:

We're so happy

We're so happy

We're so happy



Daisy & Violet:

We share everything
