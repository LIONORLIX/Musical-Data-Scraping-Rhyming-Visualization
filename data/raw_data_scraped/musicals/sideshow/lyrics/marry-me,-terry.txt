Marry Me, Terry


Daisy:

I have a solution.

Marry me, Terry.



Terry:

With the whole world expecting a different pair?



Daisy:

They're expecting the wedding

Of a Siamese twin

They won't care



Browning:

Smart girl!



Daisy:

Marry me, Terry

It makes so much sense

I know you want me

Jump off the fence

The crowd wants a wedding

The bride has withdrawn

Marry me, Terry

The show must go on



Browning:

Marry her, Connor.

This story's too big to lose.



Daisy:

No, do it because you love me.

Marry me, Terry

No need to pretend

I know you want me

As more than a friend

Last night you showed

What you're capable of

Have you forgotten the Tunnel of Love?



Terry:

I was weak



Daisy:

No, strong



Terry:

I lost control



Daisy:

Was that wrong?



Terry:

Yes, it was



Daisy:

But why?



Terry:

Not the behavior of a normal guy



Daisy:

Normal?

Feeling love is normal

Hiding it is not

Why can't you display

The love you know we've got?

Thought you were made of

The stuff it would take

My mistake

Marry you, Terry

Not on your life

I would be crazy

To be your wife

Who is the freak here

The coward, the loat?

Marry you, Terry?

No, I want you out!



Browning:

Oh, for pete's sake, I'll marry one of them!



Daisy:

That won't be necessary.

Violet's marrying Buddy after all.



Violet:

I am not.



Daisy:

Yes, you are.

I stepped to the side for your dream

You can do the same for mine



Violet:

I can't pretend.



Daisy:

Yes, you can!



Buddy:

Do I have anything to say about this?



Daisy:

Buddy, you love her.

And the most decent thing you can do for all of us,

Not to mention your own future,

Is to go through with the ceremony.



Buddy:

Is that what you want, Violet?



Violet:

Yes.



Daisy:

Well, Mr. Browning, you've got your movie stars!



Terry:

You and I can discuss the contract after the ceremony.



Daisy:

No, you won't.

We're through working together.



Terry:

Daisy, please. Let me do this for you.

Let's not confuse emotions with business.



Daisy:

I'm not confused. I don't want to work with you.

Mr. Browning, what's the title of our film?



Browning:

"Freaks."



Browning, Buddy and Terry leave...
