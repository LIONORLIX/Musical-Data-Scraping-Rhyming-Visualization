More Than We Bargained For


Terry:

Some hidden magnet

Is pulling me back

Back to this strange little show

An invisible force

Dragging me off-course

Pulling me somewhere

I know I shouldn't go

I want

I want

I want to see her

I want

I want to look at her face

I need

I need

I need to see her

That's why I'm back in this place



Buddy:

Mr. Conner!

Hey, thank God you're back!



Terry:

Buddy!

So, everything ok?



Buddy:

Better than that.

Jake, tell the girls Mr. Connor is here



Terry:

Well, let's go see them



Buddy:

They're not quite dressed

We had to wait

Till the Boss passed out



Terry:

Are they going to perform?



Buddy:

We can't wait to show you

The work we've accomplished

You won't believe your own eyes

Meeting each night

At the oddest of hours

But oh, how each hour flies

Our two girls have a special gift

I've only begun to explore

Any clouds of doubt will lift

I think we're getting more

Than we bargained for



Terry:

We'll see about that.

Sounds like you've managed ok here.



Buddy:

Working in the midst

Of the strangest folk

They're helpful

I like them

They get my jokes

I thought they were performers

In a sad, bleak show

But here I am

I fit right in

Into a freak show



Terry:

So, Buddy, you finally found a home.

The twins giving you any trouble?



Buddy:

Well Violet is slow

But we work till she gets it

Daisy does everything right

I'm more concerned

With some personal questions

I swear I did not invite

I think Violet's sweet on me

Sweet's very hard to ignore

Daisy mentions you with glee

I think we're getting more

Than we bargained for



Terry:

Daisy asks about me?



Buddy:

Only about fifty times a day.



Terry:

You're kidding.

She thinks I'll make her famous

Get her foot in the door



Buddy:

I think we're getting more

Than we bargained for

Do you think they're pretty?



Terry:

Pretty?



Buddy:

Well, they are



Terry:

Let's get them flowers



Buddy:

That's going to far



Terry:

Why?



Buddy:

Flowers are romantic

Romance is in the air

So beware



Terry:

Buddy, you've got so much to learn.

You don't know women



Buddy:

Not like them



Terry:

Let me set you right



Buddy:

I know more than you think



Terry:

They'll try to hook you



Buddy:

Oh, come on.



Terry:

But you don't have to bite

I've known lots of women



Buddy:

So I've heard



Terry:

The lovely

The gruesome

I've seen things

I've tried things

But never a twosome



Buddy:

I'm not interested in that



Terry:

Then close your eyes



Buddy:

What?



Terry:

Just a little joke



Buddy:

It's no joking matter



Terry:

You worry too much



Buddy:

I'm just saying we need to look



Terry:

Look at what?



Buddy:

Look at where this road leads



Terry:

To vaudeville



Buddy:

It's not right that we overlook their needs

They have needs



Terry:

We're giving them a chance of a lifetime



Buddy:

Are we doing what's fair and right?



Terry:

Yes, we are



Buddy:

Wish I could know what's in store



Terry:

Who knows that?



Buddy & Terry:

The future should be clear and bright



Buddy:

I think we're getting more



Terry:

Are we getting more



Buddy & Terry:

Than we bargained for

Than we bargained for

Than we bargained for





Buddy and Terry leave to get the girls flowers before the show...



Fortune Teller:

The sideshow's about to explode with excitement

Everyone's heading for the tent

They've heard of the hours you've spent

Learning your song



Jake:

I hope nothing goes wrong



Fortune Teller:

Don't worry, Jake

The future looks rosy

I see both of you falling in love



Terry:

Congratulations



Buddy:

What an occasion



Terry:

The Hilton sisters' debut



Daisy:

Flowers?



Violet:

For us?



Fortune Teller:

How thoughtful



Terry:

We're all pulling for your success



Jake:

You should be getting dressed



Violet:

Thank you all

For all your help



Fortune Teller:

We'd better go

We'll be in the front row



Jake:

Rooting for you all the way



Terry:

Your friends can't wait

To hear you sing



Buddy:

And I'm so proud

I hope you know



Buddy & Terry:

Here's to a wonderful show



Buddy and Terry leave the girls alone to get ready...
