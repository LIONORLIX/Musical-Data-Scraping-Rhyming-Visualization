Tunnel Of Love


Terry:

We're on a mid-way

A Texas-sized playground

Lots of diversion around

We need distraction

Without too much action

Let me show you a quiet spot I've found

Let me take you to the Tunnel of Love

Dark and relaxing inside

All of us could share the Tunnel of Love

Please come along for the ride

We need a break from the push and the shove

Work has us preoccupied



Buddy & Terry:

We can relax in the Tunnel of Love

Please come along



Violet:

I'll come along



Daisy:

I'll come along



Buddy, Terry, Daisy, Violet:

For the ride

We're going down to the Tunnel of Love

We'll get a boat and embark

Water below and blackness above



Terry:

We'll be alone, Daisy



Buddy:

Like we're alone, honey



Daisy & Violet:

Almost alone in the dark



Buddy, Terry, Daisy and Violet get on the Tunnel of Love ride,

where they discover how they truly feel about each other...



Daisy:

Dreamed of being close

Now I'm pressing against his side

Do I dare to make an advance?

He's not made a move

Should I swallow my girlish pride?

This could be my only chance



Buddy:

Out there in the spotlight

Never had a doubt I want her

Why do I feel panic

Down here in the dark?

Violet, I love you

Thought that love would lead to passion

Passion should be private

Me and you

But I know she's here too



Terry:

I had planned to keep the temperature cool

She's raising my Fahrenheit

Don't let passion rule you

Don't be a fool

Don't feel that appetite

Oh what the hell - why fight?



Violet:

What is going on?

Why don't Buddy's kisses feel divine?

Why do Daisy's shivers run down my spine?

Much more passion on her side than mine

Buddy's tame

Daisy's aflame



Buddy, Terry, Daisy, Violet:

Secrets of the dark

Secrets of love

Longing to be satisfied

Though no one can see in the Tunnel of Love

There's not a place I can hide



Daisy:

Terry's on fire

All the heat I've been praying for



Buddy:

I can't even try to pretend



Violet:

He has no desire



Terry:

These are sins I'll be paying for



Daisy:

I hope this never will end

Lost in the darkness

The boat that I am floating in

Feels like it's flying through space



Violet:

I want to lose myself

All the thoughts of who I am

Here in his private embrace



Daisy:

I think I might sink

Edging close to the brink

Of a dangerous steep waterfall

Or am I not moving at all?



Violet:

All alone now

No one is watching us

Why not climb over the wall?

Take me and give me your all



Daisy:

Groping my way

Towards an unstated goal

Don't know where I'm going

But feels like I've been there before



Violet:

Shouldn't you take the lead?

Shouldn't I follow?

Shouldn't you fill the need?

My heart is hollow



Daisy:

I know you are ready

I'm on the right track

No stopping now

No turning back



Violet:

I want what she's got

What I'm feeling she's got

Everything he's not yet feeling with me



Daisy:

I am yours

You are mine

It's a sin

It's divine

So divine



Violet:

I want mine

Where is mine?



Daisy and Terry kiss, while Violet and Buddy just sit there confused...



Company:

Secrets of the dark

Secrets of love

Longing to be satisfied

Though no one can see in the Tunnel of Love

There's not a place you can hide



The ride ends, and Buddy, Terry, Daisy and Violet get off...



Terry:

Was this a mistake - The Tunnel of Love?

Passion could not be controlled



Buddy:

How can we forget the Tunnel of Love?



Violet:

Why was I left feeling cold?



Daisy:

I found my dream in the Tunnel of Love

Will it continue outside?



Buddy, Terry, Daisy, Violet:

Now that we're out of the Tunnel of Love

Gotta get off

Gotta get off

Gotta get off

This ride

This ride

This ride



It's the day of the wedding, and outside there are hawkers selling souvenirs...
