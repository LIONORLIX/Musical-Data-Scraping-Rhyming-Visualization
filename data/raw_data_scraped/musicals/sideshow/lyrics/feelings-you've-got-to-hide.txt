Feelings You've Got To Hide


Daisy:

All of our dreams are coming true



Violet:

At least the dream that's starring you



Daisy:

Terry's my dream personified

I can feel him there right by my side

I can feel his love

I can feel his pride



Violet:

Those are feelings

You have got to hide



Daisy:

Why do I feel like I swallowed a butterfly?

Tickling inside

Makes me laugh

Till I want to cry

Why are my eyes turning moist

While my throat is dry?

Is it that handsome guy?

Why are my feelings racing around inside?

Will I explode

If all of my thoughts colide?

One minute brave

The next minute terrified

Are these feelings I have got to hide?



Violet:

Don't let your heart

Lead your head astray

He couldn't possibly feel that way



Daisy:

I know he loves me

I know I'll be his bride



Violet:

Those are feelings you have got to hide

Do not tell

Do not confide

These longings can't be satisfied

This wave will wash out with the tide

These are feelings you've got to hide



Daisy:

I can't hide what I feel

The way that you do



Violet:

What do you mean?

I'm not in love like you



Daisy:

I think you are

And Buddy is the guy



Violet:

Why do you say that?

Tell me why



Daisy:

I'm you're sister

I'm your shadow

I do know



Violet:

Oh, you know?



Daisy:

Yes, I know



Violet:

What I'm thinking



Daisy:

What you're thinking

I'm not deaf

I'm not blind



Violet:

You can always

Read my mind



Daisy:

Read your mind



Violet:

Now I'm the one lighting up like a firefly

Now I', the one blushing red

Eating humble pie

Why do I want to tell all

And yet feel so shy

About that handsome guy



Daisy:

You want a husband

You want to be a bride



Violet:

Heart in my throat

Like I'm on a midway ride

But I'll never show

What's going on inside

These are feelings you've got to hide



Daisy:

Why do you feel that way?



Violet:

Feelings aren't for display



Daisy:

Let's announce love today



Violet:

You would shout

What you should never say



Daisy:

Why are these feelings racing around inside?

Will all of my thoughts colide?

I know I'll be his bride



Violet:

These longings can't be satisfied

This wave will wash out with the tide

These are feelings you've got to hide



Daisy:

Are these



Daisy & Violet:

Feelings you've got to hide





It's time for Daisy and Violet to perform for their friends...



Buddy:

Ladies and gentlemen

Glad you came

Though it's late

You won't regret

The effort you've made

The sleep that is lost

Is all you paid

Tomorrow your leaving

Going away from here

Only have tonight to offer the twins' premiere

Remember this secret show

When you think of San Antonio

Ladies and gentlemen

I give you two of your own

Daisy and Violet Hilton!
