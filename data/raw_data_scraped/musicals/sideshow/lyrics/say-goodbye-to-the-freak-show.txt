Say Goodbye To The Freak Show




Violet:

What have we done?



Daisy:

Lost our jobs



Violet:

Closed a door



Terry:

Opened more

My beauties

My loves

I can see us floating to the stars

In a magic boat propelled

By your talent and unparalleled beauty



Daisy:

All because of you



Violet:

All we've ever known is the midway



Terry:

Wait till you see them

Your names on the marquee

All the way from Frisco to Dallas

Someday you will play the Palace



Violet:

We're not that good



Daisy:

We could be

With you behind us



Buddy:

Don't you fret

We're with you heart and soul



Terry:

Your sweet duet

Is our ace in a hole



Buddy:

Now will you give your all?

Your whole?



Daisy & Violet:

Oh yes

We'll do our best



Terry:

I know you will

And your best will go far

Your talent's the key

Now the door is ajar

You will frame the moonlight

Each a shining star

Say goodbye to the freak show

Say hello to the footlight's glow

Your success can only grow

Say goodbye to the freak show



Attractions:

Goodbye



Daisy:

Goodbye

We will miss you



Geek:

Don't cry

Let me kiss you



Violet:

Oh my

Why should it be so hard

To say goodbye



Harem Girl #1:

Farewell

Don't forget us



Bearded Lady:

Do tell

How you met us



6th Exhibit:

Don't dwell

On sorrow as you go



Dolly Dimples:

You will fare well



Fortune Teller:

Now, now

Saying goodbye is part of growing up

There's a whole new world of friends for you to make



Jake:

Goodbye, Daisy

Dear, sweet Violet



Daisy & Violet:

No, not goodbye to Jake



Jake:

Take wing

Fly to glory

Dance, sing

Tell your story

You bring such joy to those you've known

Take flight, take wing



Terry:

Jake, looks like their hearts might break

Saying goodbye to you

You're a friend of the twins

You've helped them along

Constant support

Quiet and strong

We could use you backstage

As we tour with their act

Why not join the troupe

Your bag is packed



Daisy:

Yes, say yes



Violet:

Please come along



Jake:

Nothing lost if I decide to

I feel I belong beside you



Attractions:

Say goodbye to the freak show

Bless your new impresario

We always new you would outgrow

The tents of the sideshow

Goodbye

Stike tents

Pull the stakes up

Go gents

Let the brakes up

No fence

Stops us from moving on

To our next show

Farewell

Don't forget us

Do tell

How you met us

Don't dwell

On sorrow as you go

You will fare well

Goodbye



Daisy, Violet, Terry, Buddy and Jake leave the sideshow...
