Buddy Kissed Me


Violet

Buddy kissed me

He kissed me for the first time



Daisy

Didn't you hear what he said?



Violet

There's only one thought

Running through my head

He kissed me



Daisy

And then they both denied

Any thought of romance



Violet

But he kissed me

Words can lie

But kisses don't



Daisy

You can lie to yourself

I won't

No one could love a Siamese twin

Nobody wants us

No one ever has

No one ever will



Violet

Why are you trying

To kill my dream?



Daisy

It's not a dream

It's a nightmare

Wake up

Look around you

We are freaks

Stuck together

And we'll always be alone



Violet

But I want to wake up

To what I'm dreaming of

Dreaming that some day

Some night

I could find love

Will I find love?
