Private Conversation


An obvious connection

I tried so hard to hide

Couldn't even say it to myself

An obvious connection

I tried to push aside

Into a corner on the darkest shelf

We'll never be alone

And my feelings can't be shown

So I try to imagine and replay

All the things I'll never get to say

You're wrapped up with another

Tangled and entwined

I invent a separation

In the private conversation in my mind

I resolve to say it all

Then I hem and haw and stall

For how could I come clean or confide

Someone else is always at your side

I want

I want

I want to tell you

I want

I want

To get you alone

I need

I need

I need to tell you

I want you for my own

If we could steal a moment

Would you be so inclined

To accept an invitation

To the private conversation in my mind



Terry imagines Daisy walking towards him, without Violet...



Daisy:

What do you want to say to me, Terry?

Tell me, this is your chance

What do you need to say to me, Terry?

Does is concern romance?

Here I am

All alone

Yours to take

Smooth me out

Calm me down

Stop the ache

Don't hold back

Don't hold off

Hold me tight

Don't object

Let's connect

Let's unite



Terry:

But you can't lose your shadow

That tie you can't unbind



Daisy:

You've made us all alone now



Terry:

All alone, but only in my mind



Daisy:

A mind is very private

We often meet in mind

Let me show you what we do there

The way we kiss

The way we intertwine

I want

I want

I want to show you



Terry:

Show me what?



Daisy:

I want to show you desite

The heat

The flames



Terry:

I'm burning for you



Daisy:

I know you are on fire

Why not be bold?

I'm crazy about you

I say it with every glance

My arms are cold and lazy without you

Come on, why don't we dance?



They dance...



Terry:

I want

I want

I want to keep you



Daisy:

Keep me where?



Terry:

I want you all for my own

My own

My own



Daisy:

You have to share me



Terry:

Oh no, I want you alone



Daisy goes back with Violet...



Terry:

I imagine us so well

How you'd dance and taste and smell

I can imagine me with you

But I don't have the guts to follow through

You're one half of a couple

That's how you are defined

And my only consolation

Is the private conversation in my mind



Terry leaves, and Buddy enters to perform a song on the radio...
