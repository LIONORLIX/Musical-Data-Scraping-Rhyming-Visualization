Buddy's Confession


Jake

If you hurt her

I will hunt you down



Terry

What was that all about?



Daisy

He loves her

He truly does



Terry

What?!



Buddy

He's right, Violet

You deserve better



Terry

Buddy...



Buddy

I've tried

But I'm playing a part

I've tried

And it's breaking my heart



Violet

You don't love me?



Buddy

I do, Violet

But not the way you want

I'm not that strong of a man



Violet

But you're the man I love



Buddy

You should be loved

By someone like Jake

Somebody strong

Who's able to take

Whatever comes alon



Sharing life with two

Is more than I can do

If only I'd known that before

Loving you is more

Than I bargained for
