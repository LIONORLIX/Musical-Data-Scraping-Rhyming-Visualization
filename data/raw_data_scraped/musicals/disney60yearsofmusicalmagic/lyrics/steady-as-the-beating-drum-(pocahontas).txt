Steady As The Beating Drum (Pocahontas)


Hega hega ya-hi-ye-hega

Ya-hi-ye-ne-he hega



Hega hega ya-hi-ye-hega

Ya-hi-ye-ne-he hega



Steady as the beating drum

Singing to the cedar flute

Seasons go and seasons come

Bring the corn and bear the fruit



By the waters sweet and clean

Where the mighty sturgeon lives

Plant the squash and reap the bean

All the earth our mother gives



O Great Spirit, hear our song

Help us keep the ancient ways

Keep the sacred fire strong

Walk in balance all our days



Seasons go and seasons come

Steady as the beating drum

Plum to seed to bud to plum

(Hega hega ya-hi-ye hega)

Steady as the beating drum



Hega hega ya-hi-ye-hega

Ya-hi-ye-ne-he hega
