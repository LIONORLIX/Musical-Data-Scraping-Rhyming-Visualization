Boo Bop Bopbop Bop (Pete's Dragon)


Look in your eyes and you whisper sweetly

You don't match in size but we fit so neatly

It's nice waking up when you're close beside me

Humming in my ear

You're joking

I can't believe it

You do

I love you too



Remember the night when you first confided

Things went so right that we both decided

Now we're together and life is perfect

Don't ever disappear

Oh really

No you're just saying

Oh is that true

I love you too



We're walking down a road of our own

The rain can never fall

I'm glad I don't have to be alone



Oh yeah



You know what to say when I want direction

You don't turn away when I need protection

Your voice is the sound of an angel singing

Music I wait to hear

Say it again

And again

Everything seems so new

I love you too

I love you too

I love you too
