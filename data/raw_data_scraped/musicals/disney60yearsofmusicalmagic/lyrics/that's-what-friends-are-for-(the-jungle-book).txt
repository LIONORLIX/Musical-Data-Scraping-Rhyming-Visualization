That's What Friends Are For (The Jungle Book)


We're your friends

We're your friends

We're your friends to the bitter end



When you're are down

Who comes around

To pluck you up

When you are down

And when you're outside, looking in

Who's there to open the door?

That's what friends are for!



Who's always eager to extend

A friendly claw?

That's what friends are for!



And when you're lost in dire need

Who's at your side at lightning speed?

We're friends of every creature

Comin' down the pike

In fact we never met an animal

We didn't like, didn't like



So you can see

We're friends in need

And friends in need

Are friends indeed

We'll keep you safe

In the jungle forevermore

That's what friends are for!
