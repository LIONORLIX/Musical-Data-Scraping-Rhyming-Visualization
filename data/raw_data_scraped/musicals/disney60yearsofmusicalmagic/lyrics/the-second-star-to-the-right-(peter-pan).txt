The Second Star to the Right (Peter Pan)


The second star to the right

Shines in the night for you

To tell you that the dreams you plan

Really can come true



The second star to the right

Shines with a light so rare

And if it's Never Land you need

Its light will lead you there



Twinkle, twinkle little star

So we'll know where you are

Gleaming in the skies above

Lead us to the land we dream of

And when our journey is through

Each time we say good night

We'll thank the little star that shines

The second from the right
