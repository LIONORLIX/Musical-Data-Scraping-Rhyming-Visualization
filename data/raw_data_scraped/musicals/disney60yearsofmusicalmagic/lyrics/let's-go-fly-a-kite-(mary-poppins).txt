Let's Go Fly a Kite (Mary Poppins)


With tuppence for paper and strings

You can have your own set of wings

With your feet on the ground

You're a bird in flight

With your fist holding tight

To the string of your kite



Oh, oh, oh

Let's go fly a kite

Up to the highest height

Let's go fly a kite

And send it soaring

Up through the atmosphere

Up where the air is clear

Oh, let's go fly a kite



Let's go fly a kite

Up to the highest height

Let's go fly a kite

And send it soaring

Up through the atmosphere

Up where the air is clear

Oh, let's go fly a kite



When you send it flying up there

All at once you're lighter than air

You can dance on the breeze over houses and trees

With your fist holding tight

To the string of your kite



O, oh, oh

Let's go fly a kite

Up to the highest height

Let's go fly a kite

And send it soaring

Up through the atmosphere

Up where the air is clear

Oh, let's go fly a kite
