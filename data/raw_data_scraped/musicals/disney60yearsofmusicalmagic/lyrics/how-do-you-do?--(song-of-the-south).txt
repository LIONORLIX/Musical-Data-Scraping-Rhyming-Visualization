How Do You Do?  (Song of the South)


How do you do? Mighty pleasant greetin'

How do you do? Say it when you're meetin'

How do you do? With every one repeatin'

Pretty good sure as you're born.



What goes up is sure to come down.

A penny lost is a penny found.

How do you do?

And you howdy back.

A little bit of this and a little bit of that.



How do you do?

Fine, how are you?

How you come on?

Pretty good sure as you're born.



Stop jumpin' around,

You'll run out of breath!

Why don't you sit back

And calm yourself?



You can hurry on now if you must.

We'll do what we like, 'cause...

That suits us.

SOLO (by Thurl Ravenscroft):

How do you do? Mighty pleasant greetin'.

Pretty good sure as you're born.

Pretty good sure as you're born.

How do you do? Mighty pleasant greetin'

How do you do? Say it when you're meetin'

How do you do? With every one repeatin'

Pretty good sure as you're born.

Pretty good sure as you're born.



The weather is good, the fishin' is fine.

What do we do with all of our time?



Well we sit and we think and we wiggle our toes.

That's what you ask us, that's what we know!



Pretty good sure as you're born.

Pretty good sure as you're born.



How do you do? Fine, how are you?

How you come on?

Pretty good sure as you're born.

Pretty good sure as you're born.

Pretty good sure as you're born.



Brer Rabbit and Brer Terrapin:



I'm lookin' for a little more adventure,

I'm headin' for a little bit of fun now,

I'm hopin' for a little more excitement,

Time to be movin' along!



I've had enough of this ol' briar patch,

I think an adventure's about to hatch,

I'm movin' on, say goodbye to me,

Down at the Laughin' Place is where I'll be!



I'm lookin' for a little more adventure,

I'm headin' for a little bit of fun now,

I'm hopin' for a little more excitement,

Time to be movin' along!



I nailed up my door, I'll see you around,

The Laughin' Place is where I'm found!

You're headin' out and not comin' back,

But I'm comin' too, I've packed my sack!



I'm headin' for a little bit of fun now,

Time to be movin' along.

Time to be movin' along!



He's lookin' for a little more adventure.

But he's headin' for a little bit of trouble.

He's headin' for a little bit of danger.

Time to be turning around.

Time to be turning around.



Careful Brer Rabbit better mend your ways,

You're headed for trouble one of these days!

Warnin' this rabbit I'm afraid is a waste,

He's headin' for the Laughing Place.

Time to be turning around.

Time to be turning around.



He's lookin' for a little more adventure.

But he's headin' for a little bit of trouble.

He's headin' for a little bit of danger.

Time to be turning around.

Time to be turning around.

Time to be turning around.
