Trust in Me (The Jungle Book)


Trust in me, just in me

Shut your eyes and trust in me

You can sleep safe and sound

Knowing I am around



Slip into silent slumber

Sail on a silver mist

Slowly and surely your senses

Will cease to resist



Trust in me, just in me

Shut your eyes and trust in me
