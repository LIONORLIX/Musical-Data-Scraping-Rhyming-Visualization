In order to be with him

Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

On the day he marries me

What a nutty family tree

A bride, a groom, a chimpanzee



Let them say he's the booby prize

She loves the monkey's uncle!

He's the guy I idolize

She loves the monkey's uncle!

Love all his monkey shines

Every day is Valentine's
