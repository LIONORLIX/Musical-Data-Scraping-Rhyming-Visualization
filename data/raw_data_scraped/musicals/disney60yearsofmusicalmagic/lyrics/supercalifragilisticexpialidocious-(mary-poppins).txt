Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!

Even though the sound of it

is something quite atrocious

If you say it loud enough you'll

always sound precocious

Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!

Um diddle diddle diddle

um diddle ay! (etc.)



Because I was afraid to speak

when I was just a lad

Me father gave me nose

a tweak

and told me I was bad

But them one day I learned

a word

That saved me achin' nose

The biggest word I ever heard

And this is how it goes: Oh!



Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!

Even though the sound of it

is something quite atrocious

If you say it loud enough you'll

always sound precocious

Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!

Um diddle diddle diddle

um diddle ay! (etc.)



He traveled all around

the world

And everywhere he went

He'd use his word and all

would say

"There goes a clever gent"

When dukes and maharajas

pass the time of day with me

I say me special word and then

they ask me out to tea



Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!

Even though the sound of it

is something quite atrocious

If you say it loud enough you'll

always sound precocious

Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!

Um diddle diddle diddle

um diddle ay! (etc.)



So when the cat had got

your tongue

There's no need for dismay

Just summon up this word

and then

You've got a lot to say

But better say it carefully or it

could change your life . . .

She's

Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!

Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!

Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!

Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!
