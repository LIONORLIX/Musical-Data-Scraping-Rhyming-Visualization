Enjoy It! (In Search of the Castaways (film))


Why cry about bad weather? Enjoy it!

Each moment is a treasure, enjoy it!

We are travelers on life’s highway, enjoy the trip

Each lovely twist and byway is bum and dip



If there’s a complication, enjoy it!

You’ve got imagination, employ it!

And you’ll see roses in the snow,

Joie de vivre will make them grow,

Voila, that’s life, enjoy it!



Ta-e-da-di-da-ya-da, Enjoy it!

Ta-e-da-di-da-ye-da, Enjoy it!



Hurricane comes your way, enjoy the breeze

Your stranded in the jungle, enjoy the trees.



If there’s a complication, enjoy it!

You’ve got imagination, employ it!

This world’s a cornucopia,

Why it could be, Utopia?

Voila, that’s right, enjoy it!



Why cry about bad weather? Enjoy it!

Each moment is a treasure, enjoy it!

We are travelers on life’s highway, enjoy the trip

Each lovely twist and byway is bum and dip



If there’s a complication, enjoy it!

You’ve got imagination, employ it!

And you’ll see roses in the snow,

Joie de vivre will make them grow,

Voila, that’s life, enjoy it!
