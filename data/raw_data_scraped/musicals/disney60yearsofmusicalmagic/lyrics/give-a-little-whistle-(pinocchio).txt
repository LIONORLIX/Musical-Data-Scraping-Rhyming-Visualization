Give a Little Whistle (Pinocchio)


When you get in trouble and you don't know right from wrong

Give a little whistle!  Give a little whistle!

When you meet temptation and the urge is very strong

Give a little whistle!  Give a little whistle!



Not just a little squeak, pucker up and blow

And if your whistle's weak, yell, "Jiminy Cricket!"

Right!



Take the straight and narrow path

And if you start to slide

Give a little whistle!  Give a little whistle!

And always let your conscience be your guide
