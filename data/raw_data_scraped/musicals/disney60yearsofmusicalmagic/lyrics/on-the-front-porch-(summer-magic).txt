On the Front Porch (Summer Magic)


Three creaky wooden stairs

Those squeaky rocking chairs

The well worn welcome mat

The lattice vines

The happy times



All I want to do

When the day is through

Is linger here on the front porch

With you

From the wicker swing

While the night birds sing

We'll watch the fireflies sparkin'

Do some sparkin' too

How the hours fly

As the moon drifts by --

How sweet the air

As we stare

At the sight

Oh! How I love to linger here like this

Hold your hand, and steal a kiss

Or two

On the front porch with you



All I want to do

When the day is through

Is linger here on the front porch

With you

From the wicker swing

While the night birds sing

We'll watch the fireflies sparkin'

Do some sparkin' too

(Some sparkin' too!)

How the hours fly

As the moon drifts by --

How sweet the air

As we stare

At the sight



Oh! How I love to linger here like this

Hold your hand, and steal a kiss

Or two

On the front porch with you
