Portobello Road (Bedknobs and Broomsticks)


Portobello road, Portobello road

Street where the riches of ages are stowed.

Anything and everything a chap can unload

Is sold off the barrow in Portobello road.

You’ll find what you want in the Portobello road.



Rare alabaster? Genuine plaster!

A filigreed samovar owned by the czars.

A pen used by Shelley? A new Boticelli?

The snipper that clipped old King Edward’s cigars?



Waterford Crystals? Napoleon’s pistols?

Society heirlooms with genuine gems!

Rembrandts! El Greco’s! Toulouse-Letrec’os!

Painted last week on the banks of the Thames!



Portobello road, Portobello road!

Street where the riches of ages are stowed

Anything and everything a chap can unload

Is sold off the barrow in Portobello road.

You’ll meet all your chums in the Portobello road



There’s pure inspiration in every creation.

No cheap imitations, not here in me store.

With garments as such as was owned by a Duchess.

Just once at some royal occasion of yore.



In Portobello Road, Portobello Road

The fancies and fineries of ages are showed.

A lady will always feel dressed a la mode

In frillies she finds in the Portobello road.



“Burke’s Peerage;” “The Bride Book;” “The Fishmonger’s Guidebook;”

A Victorian novel, “The Unwanted Son;”

“The History of Potting”, “The Yearbook of Yachting,”

The leather bound “Life of Attila the Hun.”



Portobello Road, Portobello Road

Street where the riches of ages are stowed

Artifacts to glorify our regal abode

Are hidden in the flotsam in Portobello Road

You’ll find what you want in the Portobello Road



Tokens and treasures, yesterday’s pleasures

Cheap imitations of heirlooms of old

Dented and tarnished, scarred and unvarnished

In old Portobello they’re bought and they’re sold



Portobello Road, Portobello Road

Street where the riches of ages are stowed

Artifacts to glorify our regal abode

Are hidden in the flotsam in Portobello road.

You’ll find what you want in the Portobello Road
