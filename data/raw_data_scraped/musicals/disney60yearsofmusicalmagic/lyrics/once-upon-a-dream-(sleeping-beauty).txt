Once Upon a Dream (Sleeping Beauty)


I know you

I walked with you once upon a dream

I know you

That gleam in your eyes seems so familiar to me

And I know its true

That visions are seldom what they seem

But if I know you

I know what you'll do

You'll love me at once

The way you did once

Upon a dream



(vocalizing)



But if I know you

I know what you'll do

You'll love me at once

Princess Rose and Prince

The way you did once

Upon a dream



Prince

I know you

I walked with you once upon a dream

I know you

The gleam in your eyes seems so familiar to me



chorus

And I know its true

That visions are seldom what they seem

But if I know you

I know what you'll do

You'll love me at once

The way I did once

Upon a dream
