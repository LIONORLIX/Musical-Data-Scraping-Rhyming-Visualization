Ten Feet Off the Ground (The One and Only, Genuine, Original Family Band)


Who invented music?

We'd like to shake his hand

'Cause music casts a spell on us

That we can't understand



Must be some magician

Designed a magic plan

He changed his wand to a baton

And that's how it all began



When the rhythm pounds

And the harmony sounds

And the melody rolls around

(spoken) "Prest-o Change-o!"

We're ten feet off the ground

And when the rhythm pounds

And the harmony sounds

And the melody rolls around

Right from the down beat,

We can be found

Ten feet off the ground



When everybody puts his heart in it

Everybody plays a part in it

That's how music magic is made

Everybody's toe's get tap-ier

Everybody's feeling happier

Lighter than air

Out of his chair

Ten feet off the ground



When the rhythm pounds

And the harmony sounds

And the melody rolls around

(spoken) "Prest-o Change-o!"

He's ten feet off the ground



(Music interlude)

Who invented music?

We'd like to shake his hand



(Music interlude)

That's how music magic is made

Oh, ten feet off the ground



(Music interlude)

That's how music magic is made

La, la, la, la

La, la, la, la, la

La, la, la, la, la

Lighter than air

Out of his chair

Ten feet off the ground

Oh!



Right from the down beat, we can be found

Floating along on a musical sound

Out of this world and out the world bound

Ten feet



Everybody puts his heart in it

Everybody plays a part in it

That's how music magic is made

Everybody's toe's get tap-ier

Everybody's feeling happier

Lighter than air

Out of his chair

Ten feet off the ground
