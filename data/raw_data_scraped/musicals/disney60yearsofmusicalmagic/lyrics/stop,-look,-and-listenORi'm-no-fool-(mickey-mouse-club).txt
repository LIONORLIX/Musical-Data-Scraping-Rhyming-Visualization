Stop, Look, and Listen/I'm No Fool (Mickey Mouse Club)


Stop, look and listen

And always use your head

Look at the signal

Is it green or red



First, you stop, then you look

Then you listen hard

You can make just any street

As safe as your backyard



Stop, look and listen

Your eyes will tell your feet

When you can safely

Walk across the street



First, you stop, then you look

Then you listen hard

You can make just any street

As safe as your backyard



Stop, look and listen!



(spoken) "That's very good advice, huh, and I always follow it because..."



I'm no fool! No sirree!

I want to live to be seventy-three

I play safe for you and me 'cause

I'm no fool!



Any fool play's in the street

As though it were a field

A bumper throws him for a loss

Against the car's windshield



Oh, I'm no fool! No sirree!

I want to live to be eighty-three

I play safe for you and me 'cause

I'm no fool!



Any fool gets out of cars

The wrong side only once

And if he lives to tell the tale

He's crowned a stupid dunce



Oh, I'm no fool! No sirree!

I want to live to be ninety-three

I play safe for you and me 'cause

I'm no fool!



Stop, look and listen

And always use your head

Look at the signal

Is it green or red



First, you stop, then you look

Then you listen hard

You can make just any street

As safe as your backyard



Stop, look and listen

Your eyes will tell your feet

When you can safely

Walk across the street



First, you stop, then you look

Then you listen hard

You can make just any street

As safe as your backyard



Stop, look and listen!
