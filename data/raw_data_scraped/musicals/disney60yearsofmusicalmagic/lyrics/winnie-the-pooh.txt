Winnie the Pooh


Deep in the Hundred Acre Woods,

Where Christopher Robin plays.

You'll find the enchanted neighborhood,

of Christopher's childhood days.



A donkey named Eeyore is his friend.

And Kanga and Little Roo.

There's Rabbit and Piglet.

And there's Owl.

But most of all Winnie the Pooh!



Winnie the Pooh, Winnie the Pooh,

A tubby, little cubby all stuffed with fluff.

He's Winnie the Pooh, Winnie the Pooh,

A willy, really, silly old bear.



Winnie the Pooh, Winnie the Pooh,

A tubby, little cubby, all stuffed with fluff.

He's Winnie the Pooh, Winnie the Pooh.

A willy, really silly old bear.
