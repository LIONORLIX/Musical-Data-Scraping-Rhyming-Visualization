On the Open Road (A Goofy Movie)


Goofy:

Do ya need a break from modern livin'?

Do ya long to shed your weary load?

If your nerves are raw

And your brain is fried

Just grab a friend and take a ride

Together upon the open road

C'mon, Maxie! Ah-yuk!

Max:

All in all, I'd rather have detention

All in all, I'd rather eat a toad

Goofy:

Yuck!

Max:

And the old man drives like such a klutz

That I'm about to hurl my guts

Directly upon the road

Goofy:

There's nothin' can upset me

'Cause now we're on our way

Our trusty map will guide us straight and true

Max:

Roxanne, please don't forget me

I will return someday

Though I may be in traction when I do

Goofy:

Me and Max relaxin' like the old days

Max:

This is worse than dragon breath and acne

Goofy:

In a buddy-buddy kind of mode

Max:

I'm so mad

I think I may explode

Goofy:

When I see that highway, I could cry

Max:

Ya know, that's funny

So could I

Both:

Just bein' out on the open road

Female Country Singers:

Howdy, boys

Is this the way to Nashville?

Tow Truck Driver:

Watch it, Mac!

Or you'll be gettin' towed

Prisoner:

I'm in no hurry to arrive

'Cause I'll be turnin' sixty-five

The next time I see the open road

Small Man:

Just a week of rest and relaxtion

Large Woman:

Yeah!

Small Man:

And the odd romantic episode

Max:

Very odd!

Mickey Mouse:

It's Californ-eye-ay or bust

Old Lady:

Look out, you dirtbags

Eat my dust

>From now on, I own the open road!

Goofy:

Just me and little Maxie

My pipsqueak pioneer

Nuns:

Their car ventures forever westward ho

Nuns and Goofy:

Yeehaw!

Max:

Could someone call a taxi

And get me outta here

To Beverly Hills 9-0-2-1-0

Chorus and Goofy:

Every day another new adventure

Every mile another new zip code

And the cares we had are gone for good

Max:

And I'd go with them if I could

Goofy and Chorus:

I've got no strings on me

I'm feelin' fancy-free

How wonderful to be

On the open road!
