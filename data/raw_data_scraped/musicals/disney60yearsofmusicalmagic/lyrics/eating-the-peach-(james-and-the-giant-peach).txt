Eating the Peach (James and the Giant Peach)


I've eaten many strange and scrumptious dishes in my time

Like jellied bugs and curried slugs and earwigs cooked in slime

And mice with rice is very nice

When they're roasted in their prime

But don't forget to sprinkle them with just a pinch of grime



I'm crazy 'bout mosquitos on a piece of buttered toast

And pickled spines of porcupines

And then a great big roast

And dragon's flesh, quite old, not fresh

It costs a buck at most

It comes to you in barrels if you order it by post

(It comes to you in barrels if you order it by post)



For dinner on my birthday shall I tell you what I chose?

Hot noodles made of poodles on a slice of garden hose

And a rather smelly jelly

Made of armadillo's toes

The jelly is delicious, but you have to hold your nose



Peach, peach, peach, peach, peach, peach

Peach, peach, peach, peach, peach, peach



I crave the tasty tentacles of octopi for tea

I like hot dogs, but I love hot frogs

And surely you'll agree

A plate of soil with engine oil's a super recipe

(Recipe)

I hardly need to mention that it's practically free



Peach, peach, peach, peach, peach, peach

Peach, peach, peach, peach, peach, peach

We hardly need to mention that it's practically free



Now comes, my fellow travelers, the burden of my speech

These foods are rare beyond compare

And some right out of reach

But there's no doubt I'd go without

A million plates of each

For one small mite

(One small mite)

One tiny bite

(Tiny bite)

Of this fantastic peach!



Peach, peach, peach, peach, peach, peach

Peach, peach, peach, peach, peach, peach

This fantastic peach!
