Candle on the Water  (Pete's Dragon)


I’ll be your candle on the water,

my love for you will always burn.

I know you’re lost and drifting

but the clouds are lifting.

Don’t give up, you have somewhere to turn.



I’ll be your candle on the water,

’till every wave is warm and bright.

My soul is there beside you,

let this candle guide you.

Soon you’ll see a golden stream of light.



A cold and friendless tide has found you,

don’t let the stormy darkness pull you down.

I’ll paint a ray of hope around you,

circling in the air,

lighted by a prayer.



I’ll be your candle on the water,

this flame inside of me will grow.

Keep holding on, you’ll make it,

here’s my hand so take it.

Look for me, reaching out to show,

as sure as rivers flow,

(different pitch)

I'll be your candle on the water,

this flame inside of me will grow.

Keep holding on you'll make it,

here's my hand so take it.

Look for me, reaching out to show, as sure as rivers flow,

I’ll never let you go.

I’ll never let you go.

I’ll never let you go...
