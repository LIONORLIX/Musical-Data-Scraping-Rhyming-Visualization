Someday My Prince Will Come (Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs)


Someday I ‘ll find my love

And how thrilling that moment will be

When the prince of my dreams comes to me

He’ll whisper I love you

And steal a kiss or two

Though he’s far away I’ll find my love someday

Someday when my dreams come true



Someday I’ll find my love

Someone to call my own

And I know at the moment we meet

my heart will start skipping the beats

Someday we’ll say and do

Things we’ve been longing to

Though he’s far away I’ll find my love someday

Someday when my dreams come true



Someday my prince will come

Someday we’ll meet again

And away to his castle we’ll go

To be happy forever I know

Someday when spring is here

We’ll find our love anew

And the birds will sing and weddingbells will ring

Someday when my dreams come true
