The Tiki, Tiki, Tiki Room (Disneyland)


Chorus:

In the Tiki Tiki Tiki Tiki Tiki Room

In the Tiki Tiki Tiki Tiki Tiki Room

All the birds sing words and the flowers croon

In the Tiki Tiki Tiki Tiki Tiki Room

Welcome to our tropical hideaway, you lucky people you!

If we weren't in the show starting right away,

We'd be in the audience too

All together!



Chorus

The boys in hte back are kamikaze

Because of their claws?

No, because they're macaws

And our fine feathered friend is a jolly toucan

And two can sound better than one toucan can

The bird of paradise is an elegant bird

It likes to be seen and it loves to be heard

Most little birdies will fly away

But the Tiki Room birds are here every day

Our show is delightful we hope you'll agree

We hope that it fills you with pleasure and glee

Because if we don't make you feel like that

We're gonna wind up on the lady's hat



Chorus

Our magnificent production is yet to come

So strum the guitar and beat the drum

We've been hit and we know you adore us

So come on and join us in another chorus



Chorus repeats Twice
