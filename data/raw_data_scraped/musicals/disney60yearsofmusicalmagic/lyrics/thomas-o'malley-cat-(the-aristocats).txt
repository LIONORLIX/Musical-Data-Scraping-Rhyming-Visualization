Thomas O'Malley Cat (The Aristocats)


I'm like a chee-chee-chee-chee-rony like they make at home

Or a healthy fish with a big backbone

I'm Abraham De Lacy

Guiseppe Casey

Thomas O'Malley

O'Malley the alley cat



I've got that wanderlust

Gotta walk the scene

Gotta kick up highway dust

Feel the grass that's green

Gotta strut them city streets

Showin' off my eclat, yeah

Tellin' my friends of the social elite

Or some cute cat I happen to meet

That I'm

Abraham De Lacy

Guiseppe Casey

Thomas O'Malley

O'Malley the alley cat



Duchess (spoken): Why, monsieur, your name seems to cover all of Europe

O'Malley (spoken): Well of course. I'm the only cat of my kind.



I'm king of the highway

Prince of the boulevard

Duke of the avant-garde

The world is my backyard

So if you're goin' my way

That's the road you wanna seek

Calcutta to Rome or home, sweet home,

In Paris, magnifique, you all!



Toulouse (spoken): Oh, boy! An alley cat!

Marie (spoken): Shh! Listen.



I only got myself

And this big old world

But I sip that cup of life

With my fingers curled

I don't worry what road to take

I don't have to think of that

Whatever I take is the road I make

It's the road of life make no mistake

For me, yeah,

Abraham De Lacy

Guiseppe Casey

Thomas O'Malley

O'Malley the alley cat



That's right

And I'm very proud of that

Yeah!
