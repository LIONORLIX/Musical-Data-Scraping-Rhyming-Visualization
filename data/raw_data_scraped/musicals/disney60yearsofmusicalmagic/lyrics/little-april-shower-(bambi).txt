Little April Shower (Bambi)


Drip, drip, drop

Little April shower

Beating a tune

As you fall all around



Drip, drip, drop

Little April shower

What can compare

To your beautiful sound



Drip, drip, drop

When the sky is cloudy

Your pretty music

Can brighten the day



Drip, drip, drop

When the sun says howdy

You say goodbye right away



Drip, drip drop

Little April shower

Beating a tune

Ev'rywhere that you fall



Drip, drip drop

Little April shower

I'm getting wet

And I don't care at all



Drip, drop, drip, drop

I'll never be afraid

Of a good little

Gay little

April serenade
