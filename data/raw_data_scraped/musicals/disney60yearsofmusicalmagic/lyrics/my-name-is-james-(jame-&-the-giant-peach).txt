My Name Is James (Jame & The Giant Peach)


My name is James

thats what mother called me

my name is James

so its always been



sometimes I forget

when I'm lonely or afraid

and I'll go inside my head

and look for James



There's a city that I dreamed of

very far from here

very very far away from here

very far away



there are people in the city

and they come to me

but it's very very far away you know

very far away



They'll say James, James, James how are ya ?

Isn't it a lovely day

James, James, James

were so glad you came here where we are

from so very very very far



My name is James, James, James
