Jolly Holiday (Mary Poppins)


Ain't it a glorious day?

Right as a mornin' in May

I feel like I could fly

'Ave you ever seen

The grass so green?

Or a bluer sky?



Oh, it's a jolly holiday

With Mary

Mary makes your 'eart so light

When the day is gray

And ordinary

Mary makes the sun shine bright!



Oh 'appiness is bloomin'

All around 'er

The daffoldils are smilin'

At the dove

When Mary 'olds your 'and

You feel so grand

Your 'eart starts beatin'

Like a big brass band

Oh, it's a jolly holiday with Mary

No wonder that it's Mary that we love!



Now then what'd be nice

We'll start with raspberry ice

And then some cakes and tea

Order what you will

There'll be no bill

It's complimentary



Oh, it's a jolly holiday

With you, Bert

Gentlemen like you are few

Though your just a diamond

In the rough, Bert

Underneath your blood is blue!



You'd never think of pressing

Your advantage

For bearance is the hallmark

Of your creed

A lady needn't fear

When you are near

Your sweet gentility is crystal clear!

Oh, it's a jolly holiday with you, Bert

A jolly, jolly holiday with you!
