Heffalumps and Woozles (Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day)


They're black, they're brown

They're up, they're down

They're in, they're out

They're all about

They're far, they're near

They're gone, they're here

They're quick and slick

They're insincere



Beware, beware

Be a very wary bear



A heffalump or woozle

Is very confuzle

A heffalump or woozle's very sly, sly, sly, sly

They come in ones and twoozles

But if they so choozles

Before your eyes you'll see them multiply, ply, ply, ply



They're extraordinary, so better bewary

Because they come in every shape and size, size, size, size

If honey's what you covet

You'll find that they love it

Because they'll guzzle up the thing you prize!

They're far, they're near

They're gone, they're hear

They're quick and slick

They're insincere



Beware, beware, beware, beware, beware !!
