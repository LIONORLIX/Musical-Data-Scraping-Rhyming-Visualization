God Help the Outcasts (The Hunchback of Notre Dame)


Esmeralda

I don't know if You can hear me

Or if You're even there

I don't know if You would listen

To a gypsie's prayer

Yes, I know I'm just an outcast

I shouldn't speak to you

Still I see Your face and wonder...

Were You once an outcast too?



God help the outcasts

Hungry from birth

Show them the mercy

They don't find on earth

God help my people

We look to You still

God help the outcasts

Or nobody will



Parishioners

I ask for wealth

I ask for fame

I ask for glory to shine on my name

I ask for love I can posess

I ask for God and His angels to bless me



Esmeralda

I ask for nothing

I can get by

But I know so many

Less lucky than I

Please help my people

The poor and downtrod

I thought we all were

The children of God

God help the outcasts

Children of God
