Let's Get Together (The Parent Trap)


Let's get together, yeah yeah yeah.

Why don't you and I combine?

Let's get together, what do you say?

We can have a swinging time.

We'd be a crazy team.

Why don't we make a scene? Together.



oh, oh, oh, oh

Let's get together, yeah yeah yeah.

Think of all that we could share.

Let's get together, everyday

Every way and everywhere.

And though we haven't got a lot,

We could be sharing all we've got. Together.



Oh! I really think you're swell.

Uh huh! We really ring the bell.

Oo wee! And if you stick with me

Nothing could be greater, say hey alligator.



Let's get together, yeah yeah yeah.

Two is twice as nice as one.

Let's get together, right away.

We'll be having twice the fun.

And you can always count on me.

A gruesome twosome we will be.

Together, yeah yeah yeah.
