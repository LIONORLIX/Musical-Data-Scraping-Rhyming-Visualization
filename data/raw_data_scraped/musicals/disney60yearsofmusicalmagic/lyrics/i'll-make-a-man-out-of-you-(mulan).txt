I'll Make a Man Out of You (Mulan)


Let's get down to business - to defeat the Huns

Did they send me daughters when I asked for sons?

You're the saddest bunch I've ever met

But you can bet before we're through

Mister, I'll make a man out of you



Tranquil as a forest

But on fire within

Once you find your center

You are sure to win

You're a spineless, pale pathetic lot

And you haven't got a clue

Somehow I'll make a man out of you



I'm never gonna catch my breath

Say goodbye to those who knew me

Boy, was I a fool in school for cutting gym

This guy's got 'em scared to death

Hope he doesn't see right through me

Now I really wish that I knew how to swim



(Chorus:)

Be a man

We must be swift as the coursing river

Be a man

With all the force of a great typhoon

Be a man

With all the strength of a raging fire

Mysterious as the dark side of the moon



Time is racing toward us till the Huns arrive

Heed my every order and you might survive

You're unsuited for the rage of war

So pack up, go home you're through

How could I make a man out of you?



(repeat chorus)

(repeat chorus)
