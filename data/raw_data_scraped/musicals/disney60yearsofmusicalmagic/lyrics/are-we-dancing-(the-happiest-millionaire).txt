Are We Dancing (The Happiest Millionaire)


Are we dancing

are we really here

is this feeling something real

or will it disappear



are we dancing

does the music soar

was this lovely song I hear

ever heard before



Are you're eyes confessing things

I alone can see

or is my imagination

flying away with me



Are we dancing

say we really are

than I'll know that I reached into the sky

I reached into the sky and touched a star



Is this feeling something real

or will it disappear



was this lovely song I hear

ever heard before



Are you're eyes confessing things

I alone can see

or is my imagination

flying away with me



Are we dancing

say we really are

then I'll know that I reached into the sky

I reached into the sky and touched a star
