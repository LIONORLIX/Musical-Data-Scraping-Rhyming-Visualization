Ev'rybody Has a Laughing Place (Song of the South)


Hee, hee, hee, hee, ha, ha, ha!

Boy am I in luck!

I think about my laughin' place,

Yuk, yuk, yuk, yuk, yuk! Ha-yuk, yuk!



Everybody's got a laughin' place,

A laughin' place, to go ho-ho!

Take a frown, turn it upside-down,

And you'll find yours I know ho-ho!



Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!

Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!

Boy am I in luck!

I think about my laughin' place,

Ha-yuk, yuk, yuk, yuk, yuk!



Everybody's got a laughin' place,

A laughin' place, to go ho-ho!

Take a frown, turn it upside-down,

And you'll find yours I know ho-ho!
