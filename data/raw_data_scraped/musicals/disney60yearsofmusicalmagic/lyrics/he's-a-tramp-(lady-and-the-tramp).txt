He's a Tramp (Lady and the Tramp)


He's a tramp

But they love him

Breaks a new heart

Ev'ry day



He's a tramp

They adore him

And I only hope

He'll stay that way



He's a tramp

He's a scoundrel

He's a rounder

He's a cad



He's a tramp

But I love him

Yes, even I

Have got it pretty bad



You can never tell

When he'll show up

He gives you

Plenty of trouble

I

guess he's just a

No 'count pup

But I wish that he

Were double



He's a tramp

He's a rover

And there's nothing

More to say



If he's a tramp

He's a good one

And I wish that I

Could travel his way(x3)
