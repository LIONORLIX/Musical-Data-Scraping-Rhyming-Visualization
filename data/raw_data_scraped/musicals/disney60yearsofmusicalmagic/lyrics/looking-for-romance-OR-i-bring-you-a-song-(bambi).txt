Looking for Romance / I Bring You A Song (Bambi)


I bring you a song

And I sing as I go

For I want you to know

That I'm looking for romance



I bring you song

In the hope that you'll see

When you're looking at me

That I'm looking for love



I'm seeking that glow

Only found when you're young and it's May

Only found on that wonderful day

When all longing is through



I'm seeking that glow

Only found when a thrill is complete

Only found when two hearts gently beat

To the strains of a waltz that's both tender and new



I bring you a song

For I'm seeking romance



You're by my side

There's a moon up above

It shines with a light that's so mellow and bright

It's easy to see

That tonight we shall fall in love



I bring you a song

For I'm seeking romance
