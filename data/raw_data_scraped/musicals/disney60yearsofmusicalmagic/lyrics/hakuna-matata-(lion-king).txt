Hakuna Matata (Lion King)


[Timon:] Hakuna Matata!

What a wonderful phrase

[Pumba:] Hakuna Matata!

Ain't no passing craze



[Timon:] It means no worries

For the rest of your days

It's our problem-free philosophy

Hakuna Matata!



When he was a young warthog

[Pumba:] When I was a young warthog

[Timon:] He found his aroma lacked a certain appeal

He could clear the savannah after ev'ry meal

[Pumba:] I'm a sensitive soul though I seem thick-skinned

And it hurt that my friends never stood downwind



And, oh, the shame

Thought-a changin' my name

And I got downhearted

Ev'rytime that I...

[Timon:] Hey, not in front of the Kids

[Pumba:] Oh, sorry.

[Both:] Hakuna Matata!

What a wonderful phrase

Hakuna Matata!

Ain't no passing craze



[Simba:] It means no worries

For the rest of your days

It's our problem-free philosophy



[All:] Hakuna Matata!



Hakuna...it means no worries

For the rest of your days

It's our problem-free philosophy
