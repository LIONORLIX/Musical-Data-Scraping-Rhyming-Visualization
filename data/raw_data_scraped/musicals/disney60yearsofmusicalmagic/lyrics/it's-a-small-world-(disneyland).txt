It's a Small World (Disneyland)


it's a world of laughter, a world or tears

its a world of hopes, its a world of fear

theres so much that we share

that its time we're aware

its a small world after all



CHORUS:

its a small world after all

its a small world after all

its a small world after all

its a small, small world



There is just one moon and one golden sun

And a smile means friendship to everyone.

Though the mountains divide

And the oceans are wide

It's a small small world



(chorus)
