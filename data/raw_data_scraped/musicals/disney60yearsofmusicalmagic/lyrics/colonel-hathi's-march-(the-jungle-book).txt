Colonel Hathi's March (The Jungle Book)


Hup two three four

Keep it up two three four

Hup two three four

Keep it up two three four

Company sound off!



Ho, the aim of our patrol

Is a question rather droll

For to march and drill

Over field and hill

Is a military goal!

Is a military goal!



Hup two three four

Dress it up two three four

Hup two three four

Dress it up two three four



By the ranks or single file

Over every jungle mile

Oh we stamp and crush

Through the underbrush

In a military style!

In a military style!



Hup two three four

Keep it up two three four
