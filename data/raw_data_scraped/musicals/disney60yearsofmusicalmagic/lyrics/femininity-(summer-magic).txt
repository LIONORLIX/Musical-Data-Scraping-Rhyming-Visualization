Femininity (Summer Magic)


You must walk feminine

Talk feminine

Smile and beguile feminine

Utilize your femininity

That's what every girl should know, if she wants to catch a beau



Dance feminine

Glance feminine

Act shy and sigh feminine

Compliment his masculinity

That's what every girl should know, if she wants to catch a beau



Let him do the talking

Med adore good listeners

Laugh, but not too loudly (Haha)

If he should choose to tell a joke

Be radiant, but delicate

Memorize the rules of etiquette

Be demure, sweet and pure

Hide the real you



You must look feminine

Dress feminine

You're at your best feminine

Emphasize your femininity

That's what every girl should know

Femininity, femininity

That's the way to catch a beau
