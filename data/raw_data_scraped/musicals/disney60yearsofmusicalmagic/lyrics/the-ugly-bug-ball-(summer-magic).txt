The Ugly Bug Ball (Summer Magic)


Once a lonely caterpillar sat and cried

To a sympathetic beetle by his side

I've got nobody to hug

I'm such an ug-i-ly bug



Then a spider and a dragonfly replied

If you're serious and want to win a bride

Come along with us, to the glorious annual ugly bug ball



Come on let's crawl (gotta crawl gotta crawl)

To the ugly bug ball (to the ball to the ball)

And a happy time we'll have there, one and all and the ugly bug ball



While the crickets click their cricky melodies

All the ants were fancy dancing with the fleas

Then up from under the ground

The worms came squirming around

Oh they danced until their legs were nearly lame

Every little crawling creature you could name

Everyone was glad

What a time they hade

They were so happy they came



Come on let's crawl (gotta crawl gotta crawl)

To the ugly bug ball (to the ball to the ball)

And a happy time we'll have there, one and all and the ugly bug ball



The our caterpillar saw a pretty queen

She was beautiful and yellow black and green

He said would you care to dance

Their dancing lead to romance

Then she sat upon his caterpillar knee

And he gave his caterpillar queen a squeeze

Soon they'll honeymoon

Build a big cocoon

Thanks to the ugly bug ball



Come on let's crawl (gotta crawl gotta crawl)

To the ugly bug ball (to the ball to the ball)

And a happy time we'll have there, one and all and the ugly bug ball
