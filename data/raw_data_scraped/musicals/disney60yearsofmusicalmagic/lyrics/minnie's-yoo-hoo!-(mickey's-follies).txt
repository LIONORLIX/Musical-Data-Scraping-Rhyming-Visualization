Minnie's Yoo Hoo! (Mickey's Follies)


I'm the guy they call little Mickey Mouse

Got a sweetie down in the chicken house

Neither fat nor skinny

She's the horse's whinny

She's my little Minnie Mouse!

When it's feedin' time for the animals

And they howl and growl like the cannibals

I just turn my heel to the henhouse steal

And you'll hear me sing this song

(Chorus)

Oh, the old tomcat with the meow, meow, meow!

Ol' hound dog with the bow-wow-wow!

The crow's caw-caw!

And the mule's hee-haw!

Gosh what a racket like an ol' buzz saw!

I have listened to the cuckoo cuke his coo-coo!

And I've heard the rooster cock his doodle doo-oo

With the cows and the chickens

They all sound like the dickens when I hear my little Minnie's Yoo-Hoo!
