My Own Home (The Jungle Book)


My own home, my own home

My own home, my own home



Father's hunting in the forest

Mother's cooking in the home

I must go to fetch the water

'Til the day that I'm grown

'Til I'm grown, 'til I'm grown

I must go to fetch the water

'Til the day that I'm grown



Then I will have a handsome husband

And a daughter of my own

And I'll send her to fetch the water

I'll be cooking in the home

Then I'll send her to fetch the water

I'll be cooking in the home
