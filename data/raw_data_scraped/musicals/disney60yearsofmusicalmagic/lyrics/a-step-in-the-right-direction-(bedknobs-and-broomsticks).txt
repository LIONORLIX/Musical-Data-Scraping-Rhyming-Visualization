A Step in the Right Direction (Bedknobs and Broomsticks)


After all, it's a step in the right direction

It's a step in the right direction after all

After all, it's a step in the direction

It's a step the right direction after all.



When a baby spider

tries to trap a fly

Often times, the silken thread

Will come awry

Though a tangled web is all that he can claim

It's a step in the right direction all the same.



All the same, it's a step in the right direction

It's a step in the right direction all the same

All the same, it's a step in the right direction

It's a step in the right direction all the same.



When a little sparrow wants to leave the nest

First he has to put his feathers to the test

Tumbling from a treetop can't be called success

but, it's a step in the right direction nonetheless.



Nonetheless, it's a step in the right direction

It's a step in the right direction nonetheless.

Nonetheless, it's a step in the right direction

It's a step in the right direction nonetheless.



Watch the tiny totters inching up a hill

It may seems to you he's merely standing still

Though the steps he takes are infinitely small

They're a step in the right direction after all.



After all, it's a step in the right direction

It's a step in the right direction after all

After all, it's a step in the right direction

It's a step the right direction after all.
