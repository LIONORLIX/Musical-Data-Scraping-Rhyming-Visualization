The Work Song (Cinderella)


Every time she'd find a minute

That's the time that they begin it

Cinderelly, Cinderelly

Cinderella



Cinderelly, Cinderelly

Night and day it's Cinderelly

Make the fire, fix the breakfast

Wash the dishes, do the mopping

And the sweeping and the dusting

They always keep her hopping

She goes around in circles

Till she's very, very dizzy

Still they holler

Keep a-busy Cinderelly



We can do it, we can do it

We can help our Cinderelly

We can make her dress so pretty

There's nothing to it, really

We'll tie a sash around it

Put a ribbon through it

When dancing at the ball

She'll be more beautiful than all

In the lovely dress we'll make for Cinderelly



Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry

Gonna help our Cinderelly

Got no time to dilly-dally

We gotta get a-goin'



I'll cut it with these scissors

And I can do the sewing

Leave the sewing to the women

You go get some trimmin'



And we'll make a lovely dress for

Cinderelly

We'll make a lovely dress for

Cinderelly
