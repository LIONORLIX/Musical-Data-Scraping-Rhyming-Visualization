Lavender Blue / Dilly Dilly (So Dear to My Heart)


Great grandfather met great grandmother

When she was a shy young girl

And great grandfather won great grandmother

With words more or less like this:

Lavender blue, dilly dilly

Lavender green

If I were king, dilly dilly

I'd need a queen

I told you so

Who told me so dilly dilly

Who told me so?

I told myself dilly dilly

I told you so

If your dilly dilly heart

Feels a dilly dilly way

'N if you'll answer yes

In a pretty little church

On a dilly dilly day

You'll be wed in a dilly dilly

Dress of lavender blue dilly dilly

Lavender green

Then I'll be king dilly dilly

And you'll be my queen
