Bella Notte (Lady and the Tramp)


Oh this is the night,

it's a beautiful night

And we call it bella notte.



Look at the skies,

they have stars in their eyes

On this lovely bella notte.



Side by side with your loved one,

You'll find enchantment here.

The night will weave its magic spell,

When the one you love is near!



Oh this is the night,

and the heavens are right!

On this lovely bella notte!
