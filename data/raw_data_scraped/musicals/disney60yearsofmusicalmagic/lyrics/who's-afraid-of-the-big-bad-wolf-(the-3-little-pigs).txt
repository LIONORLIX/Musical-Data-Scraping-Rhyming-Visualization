Who's Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf (The 3 Little Pigs)


(Cícero)

I built my house of straw

I built my house of hay

I toot my flute

I don't give a hoot

And play around all day



(Heitor)

I built my house of sticks

I built my house of twigs

With a hey-diddle-diddle

I play on the fiddle

And dance all kinds of jigs



(Prático)

I built my house of stone

I built my house of bricks

I have no chance

To sing and dance

For work and play don't mix



(Cícero e Heitor)

He don't take no time to play

Time to play

Time to play

All he does is work all day



(Prático)

You can play and laugh and fiddle

Don't you think you'll make me sore

I'll be safe and you'll be sorry

When the wolf comes to your door



(Cícero e Heitor)

Who's afraid of the big bad wolf

Big bad wolf

Big bad wolf

Who's afraid of the big bad wolf



Who's afraid of the big bad wolf

Big bad wolf

Big bad wolf

Who's afraid of the big bad wolf



I'll punch him in the nose

I'll tie him in a knot

I'll kick him in the shin

We'll put him on the spot



Who's afraid of the big bad wolf

Big bad wolf

Big bad wolf

Who's afraid of the big bad wolf
