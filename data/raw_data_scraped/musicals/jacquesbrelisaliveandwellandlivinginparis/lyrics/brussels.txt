Brussels


It was the time when Brussels could sing

It was the time of the silent movies

It was the time when Brussels was king

It was the time when Brussels brustled

Pick out a hat so dashing and gay

Go take a walk, it's a beautiful day

Put on your spats and your high-buttoned shoes

Get on the tram, get the gossip and news

Not a time for crying

How the heart was flying

Go take a walk, it's a beautiful day

Put on your spats and your high-buttoned shoes

Get on the tram , get the gossip and news

Not a time for crying

How the heart was flying

There was my grandfather

There was my grandmother

He knew how to do it

They lived in sin - deliciously

Now they pray for my virginity

Oh, it was the time when Brussels could sing

It was the time of the silent movies

It was the time when Brussels was king

It was the time when Brussels brustled

Sing out a song so dashing and gay

Walk hand-in-hand, it's a beautiful day

Put on you r spats and your high-buttoned shoes

Get on the tram, ge the gossip and news

Not a time for crying

How the heart was flying

There was my grandfather

There was my grandmother

Ten million guns got loaded

World War I exploded

It was such fun - oh, what a game

They saved the world but I bring it shame

Oh, it was the time when Brussels could sing

It was the time of the silent movies

It was the time when Brussels was king

It was the time when

It was the time when

Oh, it was the time when Brussels could sing

It was the time of the silent movies

It was the time when Brussels was king

It was the time when Bru...
