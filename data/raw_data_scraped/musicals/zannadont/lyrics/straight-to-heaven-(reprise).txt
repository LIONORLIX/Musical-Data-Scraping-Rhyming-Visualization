Straight To Heaven (Reprise)


STEVE

Zanna, don't... We're sorry.



ZANNA

Don't any of you remember?



KATE

We remember we used to be friends...



ZANNA

Nothing else?



STEVE

Nothing else matters... Come on...

Guys, grab a girl, girls, grab a guy

Girls, grab a girl, and guys, grab a guy



KATE

Just grab ahold of somebody, whatever feels right



MIKE

And join the army of love, we're goin dancin tonight



ROBERTA

We can't afford to leave anyone outta the game



TANK

Love who you are, and someone else might do the same



ALL

And tonight we just might go - straight -- right to heaven.



Love is goin, right to my heart

Love is goin, right to my soul

Love is goin right to my mind

Love is goin right outta control



Love is goin right to my blood,

And right to my brain

And right to my bones, I think I'm goin insane

Because tonight we're gonna go - right to heaven.



Oh yeah, tonight we're gonna go - right to heaven.

Oh yeah, tonight we're gonna go - right to heaven.

Oh yeah, tonight we're gonna go - right to heaven.

Oh yeah, tonight we're gonna go - right to heaven.
