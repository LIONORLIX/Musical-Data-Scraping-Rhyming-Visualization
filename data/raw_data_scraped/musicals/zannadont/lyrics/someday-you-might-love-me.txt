Someday You Might Love Me


Once upon a time

You'd all come to me

I'd do anything for you

Whatever it might be



Now you all point and laugh

You seem so amused

But I don't know what I have done

Help me... I'm confused



You clapped and cheered for me

The whole year through

And though so much has changed

I haven't... have you



I taught your hearts how to love

Your souls how to kiss

I taught you all that I know

I didn't teach you this



Someday you might love me

Someday you might care

Someday you might come and find me

And find that I'm not there



We gathered for a moment

And we laughed and cried and played

From now on the magic's gone

This is what it made



How can you look into me

And not see yourselves how

Man, woman, gay, straight

All things in between

I leave no one out



Someday you might love me

Someday you might care

Someday you might come and find me

And find that I'm not there



Someday you might come and find me

And find I'll still be there
