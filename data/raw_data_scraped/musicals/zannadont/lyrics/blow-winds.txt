Blow Winds


ZANNA

'Tis a far far better thing I do,

'Tis a far far better thing than I have ever done

'Tis a far far better rest than my heart will get since the day that we met

Can the heart ever take a rest from the thing he loves?

I don't know yet



(Blow Winds)

Blow winds from the city to the shore

(Blow Winds)

Blow winds from my heart to yours

(Blow Winds)

Blow winds from the mountains to the plains

(Blow Winds of Change)

Make the strange familiar, make familiar things strange



Go now, I want you to go to her (go to her)

Stand now, I want you to stand beside him (stand by him)

Be now, I want you to be in a world where you can be who you want to be

Love now, I want you to love who you want to love if it can't be me



(Blow Winds)

Blow winds from the city to the shore

(Blow Winds)

Blow winds from my heart to yours

(Blow Winds)

Blow winds from the mountains to the plains

(Blow Winds of Change)

Make the strange familiar, make familiar things strange



I can't change you

But, but I can change

Can change the world



ENSEMBLE

(Blow Winds)

Blow winds from the city to the shore

(Blow Winds)

Blow winds from my heart to yours

(Blow Winds)

Blow winds from the mountains to the plains



ZANNA

Make the strange familiar, make familiar things strange

I can't change you

But, but I can change

Can change the world
