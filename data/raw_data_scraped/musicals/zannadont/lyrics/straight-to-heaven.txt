Hey you standing all alone and staring at the guy across that floor,

I could see him smiling back at you so tell me what are you waiting for?

Hey you sitting by yourself I know exactly what you're thinking of

Well, tonight's the night that dreams some true so go on and fall in love

Yeah girls grab a guy, guys grab a girl this song is for lovers all around the world

Come on! Everybody and join the crowd,

Take a ride on the wind and come dance on a cloud.

Because tonight we're gonna go- straight to heaven!

Come on and help me out you guys!

Love is going, straight to my heart,

Love is going, straight to my soul,

Love is going, straight to my mind,

Love is going, straight out of control

Love is going straight to my blood

And straight to my brain

And straight to my bones

I think I'm going insane

Because tonight we're gonna go- straight to heaven!

Come on, let's bring a little bit of soul to this train!

Love is going, straight to my heart,

Love is going, straight to my soul,

Love is going, straight to my mind,

Love is going, straight out of control

Love is going straight to my blood

And straight to my brain

And straight to my bones

I think I'm going insane

Because tonight we're gonna go- straight to heaven!
