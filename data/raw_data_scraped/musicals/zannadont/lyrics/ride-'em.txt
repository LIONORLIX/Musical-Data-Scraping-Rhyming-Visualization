Hey everyone!

I can't tell you how excited I am to be working with such an awesome group of riders.

We've got a great year ahead of us,

so let's get right down to business and start learning the new combination, okay' It goes

something like this...

Hey, Cowgirl,

Won'tcha mosey on inta my world,

Where we can ride the open plain,

Wrang-a-lin' all our days away, so

Canter, canter ' don't say that you can't, er

I'm gonna have ta gallop, because there is a gal up here

Who's rustlin' up a herd of your love.

So saddle up!

It's time to

ALL: Ride 'em, yeah! Ride 'em, yeah! Ride 'em, yeah! (C'mon baby now)

Ride 'em, yeah! Ride 'em, yeah! Ride 'em, yeah! (C'mon baby now)

Ride 'em, yeah! Ride 'em, yeah! Ride 'em, yeah! (C'mon baby now)

Ride 'em, baby, ride 'em, ride 'em, yeah.

KATE: OK, did you all get that

RIDER #2: No human can ride like that.

KATE: Oh, come on. Anyone'

You finally met yer match. I'm

Trottin' over hill n' dale,

Kickin' up the dusty trail, so

Stand back, y'all,

Up against the wall, y'all.

and I'm the one who runs things now.

Stick 'em up! And hand over yer heart.

KATE: Oh, my God! No one has ever done my choreography like that!

ROBERTA: Well, it flows so lyrically...

KATE: You must have had years of training to ride like that.

ROBERTA: Nah, first time.

KATE: You mean...you risked riding a mechanical bull just to impress me

ROBERTA: Well, I've done weirder things.

KATE: Really'

ROBERTA: Don't ask. You know, when I see you straddling a mechanical bull,

it's like'we have some sort of spiritual

connection, you know

KATE: Yeah. I feel it, too.

ALL: So get along, lil' doggies, get along.

ROBERTA: Yippi-aye-ee!

ALL: You've been corraled, my Buffalo Gal, where you belong.

had better be tough enough to handle this.
