I Could Write Books


X mike: i could write books

'Bout all the things you don't know about me,

Page after page of all the things you didn't say.

I could write books

'Bout all the things you didn't do,

And then write twice as much

About how much i still love you.

I drop hints about my birthday,

You forget it anyway.

I say pick me up at seven,

And you do, but the wrong day.

Is there something i should know about

That's going on inside?

What is wrong with me that there's

So much of you you hide?

I could write books

'Bout all the ways you hurt me,

All the ways you didn't even know could destroy a person so.

I could write books

'Bout all the things you took from me,

And then write twice as much

About how much you give back.

I could fill all the desert sands

With ancient scriptures from my hands,

Watch siroccos come erase them

And then write them all again.

I just can't understand why i do

All these things that don't make sense;

But love it seems has a logic

That defies all evidence.

I could write books

'Bout all the things i don't know about you,

Volumes one and two of all the doubt you've put me through.

And maybe i'll never know

Why you do the things you do,

But i do know...i'll always love you.

'Cuz deep inside, i think you love me, too.
