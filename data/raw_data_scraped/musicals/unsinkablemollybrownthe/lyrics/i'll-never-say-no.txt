I'll Never Say No


I'll never say no to you,

Whatever you say or do,

If you ask me to wait for a lifetime.

You know I'll gladly wait

For a lifetime or two

Just to look at you.

I'll smile, when you say "Be Glad,"

I'll weep if you want me sad.

Today is tomorrow

If you want it so.

I'll stay or I'll go,

But I'll never say no...
