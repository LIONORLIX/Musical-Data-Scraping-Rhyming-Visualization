I Ain't Down Yet


I'm goan' to learn to read and write,

I'm goan' to see what there is to see,

So if you go from nowhere

On the road to somewhere

And you meet anyone

You know it's me.



You'll see me carried shoulder high,

By famous people I've never met,

But till I leave the rear,

It's from the rear you'll hear,

"I ain't down yet."

To show that you know,

You got to show you know you know!



I'm goan' to move

From place to place

To find a house

With a goldn stair

And if that house is red

And has a big brass bed

I'm liiiivin' there.



You'll see me carried shoulder high,

By famous people I've never met,

But till I leave the rear,

It's from the rear you'll hear,

"I ain't down yet."
