One Fine Day


Saw the wandrin' eye inside my heart

Shouts and battle cries from ev'ry part

I can see those tears ev'ry one is true

When the door appears I'll go right through, ooh



I stand in liquid light like ev'ryone

I built my life with rhymes to carry on

And it gives me hope to see you there

The things I used to know that one fine



One fine day

One fine day



In a small dark room where I will wait

Face to face I find I contemplate

Even though a man is made of clay

Ev'rything can change one fine



One Fine Day...



Then before my eyes-Is standing still

I beheld it there a city on a hill

I complete my tasks one by one

I remove my masks when I am done



Then a peace of mind fell over me

In these troubled times I still can see

We can use the stars to guide the way

It is not that far one fine...



One fine day

One fine day...
