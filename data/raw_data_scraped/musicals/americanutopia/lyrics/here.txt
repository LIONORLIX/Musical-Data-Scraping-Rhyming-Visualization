Here


Here is a region of abundant details

Here is a region that is seldom used

Here is a region that continues living

Even when the other sections are removed



Put your hand out of your pocket

Wipe the sweat off of your brow

Now it feels like a bad connection

No more information now



As it passes through your neurons

Like a whisper in the dark

Raise your eyes to the one who loves you

It is safe right where you are



Here is an area

Of great confusion

Here is a section

That's extremely precise



And here is an area

That needs attention

Here is a connection

With an opposite side



Here is many sounds

For your brain to comprehend

Here the sound is organised

Into things that make some sense



Here there is something

We call hallucination

Is it the truth or merely a description
