Glass, Concrete & Stone


Now, I'm waking at the crack of dawn

To send a little money home

From here to the moon



Is rising like a discotheque

And now my bags are down and packed

For traveling



Looking at happiness

Keeping my flavor fresh

Nobody knows I guess

How far I'll go, I know, so I'm



Leaving at six o' Clock

Meet in a parking lot

Harriet Hendershot

Sunglasses on she waits by this



Glass and concrete and stone

It is just a house, not a home



Skin that covers me from head to toe

Except a couple tiny holes

And openings



Where the city's blowing in and out

And this is what it's all about

Delightfully



Everything's possible

When you're an animal

Not inconceivable

How things can change, I know, so I'm



Putting on aftershave

Nothing is out of place

Gonna be on my way

Try to pretend it's not only



Glass and concrete and stone

That it's just a house, not a home



And it's glass and concrete and stone

It is just a house, not a home

And my head is fifty feet high

Let my body and soul be my guide
