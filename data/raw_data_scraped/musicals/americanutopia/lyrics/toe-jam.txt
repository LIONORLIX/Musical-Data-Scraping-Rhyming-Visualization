Toe Jam


[Verse 1: David Byrne]

I was asked in New York City: Do you like my clothes?

I'm talking to my tape recorder, walking down the road

But on Friday night, I'm, purified that my feet don't touch the floor

When the rubber meets the road, in between my toes



[Verse 2: David Byrne]

Everyday is fucking perfect, its a paradise

Watch my life like its a movie, have to watch it twice

A boy looks at a girl, and a girl looks like a pony

She gallops all day long, in between my toes

And every night, she's purified, she don't do that dance no more

When the rubber meets the road, in between my toes



[Verse 3: Dizzee Rascal]

I'm skankin on the dance floor, I'm drunk off that hennessey

I ain't sober, I dont mix with coca cola or soda

But right now im on a roller, I take a look over my shoulder

When I see that sexy thing, I think its time to work my way over

So I shuffle on my heals, and bounce on my toes

I'm crazy and she knows, still its all good I suppose

She picked a good place and she packed it up

I got behind her and I lapped it up

And we danced all night til the sun came up

Then i took her to my yard then i racked it up

[Verse 4: David Byrne]

I'm a member of the ju ju nation

Down in new Orleans

You don't need an application

If you move your feet



[Hook: David Byrne]

Explode if you poke it

Exposed on the floor

It grows if you soak it

It rolls out the door



Now



[Verse 5: David Byrne]

Summer time, every night, now my feet don't touch the floor

She don't do that dance no more, in between my toes

Him and you, you and I, I don't do that dance no more

When the rubber meets the road, in between my toes



[Verse 6: David Byrne]

The lady starts to sing, but she ain't no disco dancer

She learned to shake her thing, in between my toes



[Hook: David Byrne]

Explode if you poke it

Exposed on the floor

It grows if you soak it

It rolls out the door

Explode if you poke it

Exposed on the floor

It grows if you soak it

It rolls out the door
