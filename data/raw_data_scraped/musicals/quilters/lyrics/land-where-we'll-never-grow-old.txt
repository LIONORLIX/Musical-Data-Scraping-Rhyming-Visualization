Land Where We'll Never Grow Old


I have heard of a land

On a far away strand

It's a beautiful home of the soul



Built by Jesus on high

Where we never shall die

It's a land where we'll never grow old



Never grow old (where we'll)

Never grow old

In a land where we'll never grow old

Never grow old (where we'll)

Never grow old

In a land where we'll never grow old.



*Dialogue



In that beautiful home

Where we'll nevermore roam

We shall be in that sweet by and by



Happy praise to the king

To eternity sing

'Tis a land where we never shall die.
