Hands Around


Hands, all hands around

Now lay on the healing hands

With no cross there is no crown

Oh sisters, sisters, spread the healing hands around



Hands, all hands around

Blest be the tie that binds

Let all the hope in your working hands

Bring you sisters, sisters bring you peace of mind.



Stretch them out (Stretch them out)

O'er troubled waters

Gather your strength

Daughters of Zion

Hold fast

Hold tight



*Dialogue



At evening time there shall be light

*At evening time

At evening time

At evening time there shall be light

At evening time there shall

Be light!

Light! Light! Light!

Light!
