Pieces of Lives


This was a piece of my wedding dress

Love and laughter



*Dialogue



This was a piece of my wedding dress

Love and laughter and tenderness



Tenderness

And this sprigged muslin; color of corn (color of corn)



I wore it after my John was born

Wore it after our John was born



Pieces of lives

Patches and tatters

All of the precious, the little, the matter of our lives

Pieces of lives

Stitches and secrets

Pieces of women's lives



Pieces of lives

Patches and tatters

All of the precious, the little, the matter of our lives

Pieces of lives

Tattin' and trimmin'

Pieces of women's (pieces of women's) lives



Pieces of lives

Swatches and notions

All the unspoken emotion, devotion of our lives (devotion of our lives)

Pieces of lives

Stitches and secrets

Pieces of (Pieces of) women's lives!
