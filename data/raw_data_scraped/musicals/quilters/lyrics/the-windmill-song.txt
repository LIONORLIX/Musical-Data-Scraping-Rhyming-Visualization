The Windmill Song


Wheel in the wheel in the wheel in the wheel, way in the middle of the air

Wheel in the wheel in the wheel in the wheel, way in the middle of the air

Wheel in the wheel in the wheel in the wheel, way in the middle of the air

Wheel in the wheel in the wheel in the wheel in the wheel



Daddy's hand made a circle that cut a circle in the sky

Daddy's hand made a windmill

And up in the attic where we'd lie



It seemed bigger than the moon

Or a wagon wheel

What a sight for our sore eyes

And we would drift to sleep

To the whirring lullabies



Wheel in the wheel in the wheel in the wheel, way in the middle of the air



Come on in, I'll spin you in a dream

Little prairie girl



Wheel in the wheel in the wheel in the wheel, way in the middle of the air



Daddy's mill made a circle

That joined the wind to the earth below

Giving life, pumping water

And causing all living things to grow



Now me and June

Snuggling spoons

And oh, how many tunes it played

And we would drift to sleep

To the whirring of the blades



Wheel in the wheel in the wheel in the wheel in the wheel



*Dialogue



Come on Come on in,

I'll spin you in

A dream Let me spin

you in my

wooden arms

Ooh-ooh All around the

Ooh- wah world

Ooh-ooh Way in the

wah ooh middle of Daddy's hands

the air

Ooh-ooh

Ooh-wah

Ooh-ooh Way in the

wah ooh middle of Daddy's hands

the air

Ooh-ooh

Ooh-wah

Ooh-ooh Way in the

wah ooh middle of Daddy's hands

the air



Ooh Air Hands.
