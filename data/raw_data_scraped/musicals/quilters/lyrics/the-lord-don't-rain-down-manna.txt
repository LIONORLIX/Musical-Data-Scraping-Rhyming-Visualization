The Lord Don't Rain Down Manna


The lord don't rain down manna in my yard

Praise God from whom all blessings flow

The lord don't rain down manna, manna in my yard

Praise him all creatures here below

Praise him above ye heavenly host

(When it rains)

Don't it though

Muddy waters overflow

The lord don't rain, don't rain down manna, it don't rain manna in my yard

Praise Father, Son and Holy Ghost
