Talking:

Here's a little bit of old school for ya,

That goes a little something like this...



I always tried to be the flyest kid in the block

The popular one with the rising stocks

So that's when I had this bright idea

Throw the party of the month

No, the party of the year



All the fine girls couldn't turn it down

Now all I gotta do is get my parents out

Should I send them to a movie

No, send them to a show

Let me think, hmmmmmm

It's gotta be long though



I said Mom, Dad, yo why ya sittin home
