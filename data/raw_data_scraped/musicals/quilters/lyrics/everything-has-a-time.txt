Everything Has a Time


Every log in my house...



Everything has a time

And early in the morning I

Am tending my flowers and grapevines

And when everything's properly done

It puts me in mind

To get to my quilting

And let the light shine



Every log in my house, straight as a pine

Can grow...



I've done my portion of creating

Trimming and weaving and cultivating

When everything within it's time

Is mended and tended

Then it puts me in mind

To get to my quilting

And let the light shine...

Dandelion carpet

Dandelion carpet

And let the light shine...

Dandelion...
