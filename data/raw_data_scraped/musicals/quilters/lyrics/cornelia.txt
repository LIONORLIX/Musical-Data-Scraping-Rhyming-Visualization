Cornelia


For my Cornelia corncob doll

I found the longest cornsilk strands

And made her a right pine head of hair

And from the husks I made her floppy hands

*Whaddya think?

*It's good!



I'd sit and pretty her up

'Till she's be sitting pretty

It was the morning and the evening of the first day.



For my Cornelia corncob doll

I made a hat of dried sunflower

And then I'd gussie it up

With chicken feathers

I'd be hunting them for hours

*Whaddya think?

*It's good!



Then I'd be painting her face

'Till she'd be quite the lady

It was the morning and the evening of the second day

It was the morning and the evening of the second day



And then I'd fix up a frock from the piecing bag

From the scraps of my Sunday best

And then I'd quick

Whip up a Cornelius doll

And on the third day I'd get them wedded and blessed



And come the morning and the evening of the

Fourth day

And of the

Fifth day

And of the

Sixth day



There'd be dozens of nubbins for corncob babies

And come the seventh day they'd rest



*So much begaggin'!

Ay, yi yi yi yi yi yi



A new Cornelia corncob doll

Would be created every fall

And I could pretty much make her up pretty

From almost nothing

Nothing at all (From almost nothing at all)



And I'd be primping her up

'Till she'd be tired of primping

Throughout the mornings and the evenings Every morning, every evening

Every morning, every evening

Every morning, every evening

Of the winter's day



La, la, la, la, la,

Cornelia.
