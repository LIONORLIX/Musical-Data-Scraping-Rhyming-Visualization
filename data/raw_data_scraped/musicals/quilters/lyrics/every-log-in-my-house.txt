Every Log in My House


Every log in my house,

Straight as a pine can grow



*Dialogue



Every log in my house,

Straight as a pine can grow



*Dialogue



Every log in my house,

Straight as a pine can grow

Every log in my house,

Straight as a pine can grow



Every room has a window

And every room has a door

And there's a dandelion carpet

Growing through the floor

Growing through the, growing through the, growing through the floor



Jump, jump, jump, the Rocky Mountains

Jump, jump, jump, the Rocky Mountains

Jump, jump, jump, the Rocky Mountains

Jump, jump, jump, the Rocky Mountains

Jump, jump, jump, the Rocky Mountains
