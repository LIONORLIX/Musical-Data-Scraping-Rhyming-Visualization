Thread the Needle


Children come

Thread the needle



*Dialogue



Children come

Thread the needle, thread the needle, keep 'em all going, thread the needle



Come



Keep 'em all going, keep 'em all going, keep 'em all going, keep 'em all going



Don't break up the rhythm of the stitching

Thread up the sharps and the in-betweens



*Sharp!

*Sharp!

*In-between! Sharp!

*In-between!

*Sharp! Sharp!

*In-between!



Stick 'em in the middle of the quilting frame

Then go out and play your games

Stick 'em in the middle of the quilting frame

Then go out and

Then go out and play

Children come

Thread the needle

Thread the needle

Children!
