Quiltin' and Dreamin'


Settin' there under the quilting arbor

Of an afternoon in the spring

It was the fourteenth day of April

And the meadow larks did sing



Thinking while quilting through blue, pink and purple

All the happy colors of my design

I must have had the wild prairie flowers

Somewhere in the back of my mind



Quilting and dreaming a dream

On every stitch

Conjuring up a cowboy for my husband to be

Longing for to see him the one

Who'd lie dreaming underneath my lone star

With me



Settin' there under the quilting arbor

Of an afternoon in the spring

(All in the spring)



Laughing and blushing and pricking my fingers

Ripping out some crazy seams



Quilting and dreaming a dream

On every stitch



Conjuring up a cowboy strumming on a guitar



Dreaming about the caring when two become one

Sharing life beneath my lone star



Sharing life beneath my lone star.
