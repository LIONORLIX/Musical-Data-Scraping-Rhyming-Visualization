Who Will Count the Stitches?


Twenty-five years to make a comfort

That is longer lasting than a life

Twenty-five years I labored gladly

Who will count the stitches?



Sarah the child and child bearer

The wife and woman I was taken for



The stitches tell of all these and many Sarah's more

Who will count the stitches?
