The Butterfly


There's a certain yellow light

And suddenly everything's quiet

And the dust came toward you

Rising and rolling

Wanting to wrap you inside it



It was dark and cold when the sand hit

And you'd wake up buried alive

It was just like being dead

If not for my butterfly



If not for my butterfly



Aah, aah

Aah, aah



Aah, aah

Aah, aah



Out of the belly of Sheol to the sky



*Dialogue



Goes my butterfly
