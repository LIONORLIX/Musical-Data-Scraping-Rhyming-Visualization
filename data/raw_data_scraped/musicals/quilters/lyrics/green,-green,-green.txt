Green, Green, Green


Where I was born

Was... North Carolina

In a big, white house

With ivory pillars



'Bout four of five chimneys

Keeping us warm

And acres and acres

*And hundreds

And thousands of acres

Of rolling green lawns

Oh the green, green green, of the rolling green lawns



Where I was born

We had white picket fences

And the hills went rolling clear down to the road

And disappeared

And that great wooden house

Was like a ship on an ocean of green

And there's no green quite like it out here

Oh the green, green green, of the rolling green lawns

Oh the green, (Oh the green) of the rolling green lawns



*Dialogue



Oh the green, green green, of the rolling green lawns.
