Grandpapa


A young man with no money is better

than an old man with no money.

Goodbye, Grandpapa!



Grandpapa? Grandpapa?

I’ll show you who’s Grandpapa!

Zorba! Zorba!



Listen! There are two Zorbas.

The inner Zorba is as slender as a reed!

Look at that, look at that,

Poor old man is weak and fat!



He has thirty-two teeth!

Look at that, there’s no doubt,

Every tooth is falling out!



He wears a red carnation behind his ear!

Look at that, over there,

Golden beard but long white hair.



This is the outside Zorba!

Look at that, ????,

Old and feeble Grandpapa,

Weak and feeble Grandpapa.

Weak and feeble Grandpapa

Grandpapa, Grandpapa,

Grandpapa, Grandpapa, Grandpapa,

Grandpapa, Grandpapa,

Grandpapa, Grandpapa, Grandpapa!
