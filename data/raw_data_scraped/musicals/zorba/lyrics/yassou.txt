Yassou


For the servant of God, Alexis,

and the servant of God, Hortense,

now affianced together, we beg salvation, O Lord!



*Singing in Greek*



Yassou! Yassou! Yassou! Yassou! Yassou!



A lily and a veil, to represent her purity,

A lily and a veil to be pure,

Ah! Ah!

Did you hear that? Did you hear that? I’m pure!



Yassou! Yassou! Yassou! Yassou! Yassou!



Some water from the well,

To summon back his innocence,

The chalice and the water just for you!

Ah! Ah!

Canavaro! What? You’re my virgin too!



Yassou! Yassou! Yassou!



Wreaths of roses and cherries from the tree,

To show that she is married,

She’s absolutely married,

She’s positively married,

She certainly is as married as she’ll ever be!



Yassou! Yassou! Yassou! Yassou! Yassou!



Confetti we can throw to represent our happiness,

Exchange the rings and drink the wine and dance.



*Singing in Greek*



Promise you will never part again!



*Singing in Greek*



Canavaro? I promise!

Bouboulina? I promise!

Amen!



Yassou! Yassou! Yassou! Amen!

Yassou! Yassou! Yassou! Amen!



Come my sweet!

Let me give you the first respectable

kiss you’ve ever had!



Amen!
