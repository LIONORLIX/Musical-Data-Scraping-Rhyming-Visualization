The Butterfly


Not too fast, not too fast,

Let it grow, let it last,

Nature knows when and why…

The butterfly:



I remember one morning

When I saw a cocoon in the bark of a tree,

I remember I marveled

that imprisoned inside was a butterfly waiting to be free.

Not too fast, not too fast,

Let it grow, let it last,

Nature knows when and why…

Continue…



I was very impatient so I warmed

the cocoon with the breath of my sighs,

And the butterfly trembled and began

to emerge like a miracle right before my eyes.

Not too fast, not too fast,

Let it grow, let it last,

Nature knows when and why…

Sorry…



All at once I discovered

that his delicate wings were all crumpled and torn,

When he still wasn’t ready

I had made him be born.

I was stronger than nature

and I had made him be born.

But the wonder of life had a definite plan,

So he died in my hand by the will,

Not of God, but of man.

Not too fast, not too fast…



Every man has a moment

And I’m waiting for mine,

When I’m finally free.

But I mustn’t be hurried.

Give me light…give me time.

Like the butterfly…

Like the butterfly…

Like the butterfly…

Like the butterfly…

Not too fast, not too fast,

Let it grow, let it last,

Nature knows when and why…



Think about the story of the butterfly,

Think about the story of the butterfly,

Think about the story of the butterfly,

Think about the story of the butterfly,



The butterfly…



Not too fast…
