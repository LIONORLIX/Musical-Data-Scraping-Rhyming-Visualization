The Top of the Hill


Zorba! Zorba!



There’s a house at the top of the hill

Where someone’s waiting for you.



There’s a room in the house at the top of the hill

Where someone’s waiting for you.

Waiting for you!



There’s a door to the room

of the house at the top of the hill,

Where someone’s waiting for you.

Waiting for you!



There’s a woman at the door…

There’s a woman at the door…

There’s a woman at the door…

In a room in a house at the top of the hill,

Waiting for you!



Zorba!



And the roof is red!

And the woman is French!

And the walls are white!

And the woman is French!

And the steps run down!

And the woman is French!

And the well is cool!

And the woman is French!



At the house at the top of the hill!



Zorba!



And the ouzo’s weak!

And the veal is tough!

And the bed is hard!

And the sheet is rough!

And the bread is old!

And the wine is hot!

And the night is cold!

But the woman is not!



At the house at the top of the hill!



There’s a house at the top of the hill

Where someone’s waiting for you.

Waiting for you!



There’s a room in the house at the top of the hill

Where someone’s waiting for you.

Waiting for you!



There’s a door to the room

of the house at the top of the hill,

Where someone’s waiting for you.

Waiting for you!



There’s a woman at the door…

There’s a woman at the door…



(Mme Hortense! Mme Hortense!

People are here!

Two men, coming up the hill!)



Zorba! Zorba!



There’s a house at the top of the hill

Where someone’s waiting for you.

Waiting for you…

Waiting for you!
