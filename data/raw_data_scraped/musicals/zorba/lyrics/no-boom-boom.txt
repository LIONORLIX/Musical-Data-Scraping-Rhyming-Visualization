No Boom Boom


Crete was in a state of revolution!

The fleets of four great powers anchored here…

Hmm… So, I also anchored here.

Four great powers!

Four admirals… ahh…

You should have seen them!

There they were,

My admirals, the image of romance,

From England, Russia, Italy, and France.

There they were, my brave quartet,

Dressed in their navy blues,

With wide, plumed hats, and golden braid,

And patent-leather shoes.



They were just about to fire… on Crete!

When on my knees, in my pink chemise,

I destructed them toute de suite!



By saying…



Please sir, little admiral, no Boom-boom!

Please sir, pretty admiral, no Boom-boom!



This evening when it’s dark,

I’ll let you come to my room,

But first you have to promise,

No Boom-boom!



Please sir, little admiral, no Boom-boom!

La la la la…

Please sir, little admiral, no Boom-boom!

La la la la…



This evening when it’s dark,

I’d like to come to your room,

But first you have to promise,

No Boom-boom!



And they listened to me!

Ah, we could see the Cretans through our binoculars…

They looked so tiny…



I seized the beard of the Italian admiral

(I was more familiar with him)

I seized his beard and I said,

“My Canavaro, please don’t shoot the little people!”

Mmm… how nice he smelled…

How nice they all smelled…



My Frenchman smells of lemon, my Italian violet,

My English smell of something, I forget…

My Russian wore a musk they make from oily Georgian bark,

I learned each smell

So I could tell tell between them in the dark!



They’d fill a bath with pink champagne,

And throw me in the tub…

While two would drink, the other two would scrub!

We played that way until the day they set this island free,

And so my dear, if Crete’s still here,

It’s all because of me!



It was I who kept the navy in tow!

But did your king ever say a thing?

Or decorate me? No!



Please sir, little admiral, no Boom-boom!

That’s what I always used to say.



Please sir, pretty admiral, no Boom-boom!

I had a most convincing way.



This evening when it’s dark,

I’ll let you come to my room,

But first you have to promise,

No Boom-boom!



No boom-boom, hey boss!

No boom-boom!



(Singing and laughing)



Please sir, little admiral, no Boom-boom!

Please sir, pretty admiral, no Boom-boom!

This evening when it’s dark,

I’ll let you come to my room,

But first you have to promise,

Promise, promise, promise,

No Boom-boom!

No Boom-boom!

No boom, boom, boom!
