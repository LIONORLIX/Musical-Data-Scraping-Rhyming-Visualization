I Am Free/Life Is(Reprise)


I have nothing. I want nothing.

I am free!

I need nothing. I owe nothing!

I am free!



If my feet say, “Come this way!”

I probably would,

But if they say,

“Go that way!” that way is just as good.



I ask nothing.

I judge nothing.

I am free!



There is one Zorba, and that Zorba

I must be!



Heaven waits for other men, but not for me!

I fear nothing! I hope for nothing!

I am free!



Hey Boss, you wanna hear a story?

Yes.

You do? Then I’ll tell you.



One morning in Salonika, I never will forget,

I was passing by the oldest man I think I ever met.

He was kneeling in an orchard,

When he turned and looked at me,

And he said, “Come watch me,

Sonny, as I plant this almond tree!”

I tell you, Boss, that fellow, he was over 95,

And I think he had a week,

Or maybe two to stay alive,

But he had to plant that almond tree,

And when I asked him why,

He said,

“I live every minute as if I would never die.”



Think of that, Boss!

He lived as if he would never die.

I live as if I would die any minute!

For that reason… just that reason,



I am free!

I see somewhere, I go somewhere!

I am free!



Think of that whenever you remember me!

I fear nothing!

I hope for nothing!

I am free!



Dialog:



My boat doesn’t leave for an hour…

I’ll walk a ways with you.

No, no, let’s do it quick, here and now,

Like men cut short smoking, wine, or a love affair.

Come! Embrace Zorba!



Life is what you do while you’re waiting to die,

Life is how the time goes by!



Having if lucky, wanting if not,

Looking for the ruby underneath the rot,

Hungry for the pilaf in someone else’s pot,

But that’s the only choice you’ve got!



Life is what you do while you’re waiting to die,

Life is how the time goes by!



This is how the time goes by!
