King Of The World


Once upon a time I had tides to control

I had worlds to win

And stars to ignite

And they threw flowers at my feet

When I walked through the town



Once upon a time I had lives to protect

I had rules to change

And wrongs to set right

And there were people at my side

And there were rivers I could guide

I wanted nothing in return



Let me out of here

Give me back all my dreams

Let me out of here

Let please see the sun

Let me out of here

At least tell me what I did wrong



I'm king of the world

Chief of the sea

High in the wind

At least I used to be

And I'm king of the world

Please set me free

Let me remind them of my promise

Live my given destiny



Once upon a time I had fate in my hands

And the confidence of a million regimes

And they said, "Brother you're in charge

We'll follow anything you say"



Once upon a time Father said to me,

"Child you are everything

That you see in your dreams"

And I thought, Jesus, that's the key

There are no walls surrounding me

There are no prisons in this life



Let me out of here

Give me back to the wind

Let me out of here

Let me please see my son

Let me out of here

Don't you understand who I am?



I'm king of the world

Chief of the sea

High in the wind

At least I try to be

And I'm king of the world

Please set me free

I had the power and the promise

Give me back my family



Why are we punished for wanting to explore?

Why am I sitting in this cell?

I was not challenging the system

I was working for the people

I just wanted to be better



Why are we punished for wanting to survive?

Why am I locked behind these bars?

Tell the children I'll return to them

Tell them . . . Someone,

Let them know I will be free



I will not be defeated

I will stand like a mountain

And the road will stretch before me

And they'll know it's time to follow



And we'll lift our eyes

And raise our heads

And face the sun

And tell the future

I'm king of the world

Land of the free

High in the sky

The best that I can be

And I'm king of the world

Watch and you'll see

Nothing can stop me from tomorrow,

Keep me from my destiny



I'm king of the world

I'm king of the world

I'm . . . I'm . . .

At least I used to be
