Christmas Lullaby


I'll never have the power to control the land

Or conquer half the world

Or claim the sun

I'll never be the kind who simply waves her hand

And has a million people do

The things I wish I'd done



But in the eyes of heaven

My place is assured

I carry with me heaven's grand design

Glory, Oh,

Glory I will sing the name of the Lord

And He will make me shine



And I will be like Mother Mary

With a blessing in my soul

And I will give the world my eyes

So they can see

And I will be like Mother Mary

With a blessing in my soul

And the future of the world inside of me



In the eyes of heaven

My place is assured

I carry with me heaven's grand design

Glory, Oh,

Glory I will sing the name of the Lord

And He will make me shine



And I will be like Mother Mary

With a blessing in my soul

And I will give the world my eyes

So they can see

And I will be like Mother Mary

With a blessing in my soul

And the future of the world inside of me



And I will be like Mother Mary

With the power in my veins

To believe in all the things

I've yet to be

And I will be like Mother Mary

And I'll suffer any pains

For the future of the world

For the future of the world

Inside of me
