The Steam Train


You don't know me, but you will

Let me introduce myself



Submitted for your approval

A picture of basketball

The man with the muscle

And the man with the moves



Submitted for your approval

The man who's too fast to fall

The man who can hustle

And the man who can fly

Who always is hot

When it's time for the shot



?Cause at any time you want me at all

Any rhyme or reason

Brother, I'm the brother you call to play

Spring or summer,

Winter or fall

Any time or season

Catch the boy who's moving the ball away



It's called a steam train

Coming down the track

Better watch your step

Better watch your back

Can't you see the shadow

Fast and black

And the steam train's rolling by



Steam train chuggin' down the hill

If you don't move now then you never will

He's on your tail and he's in for the kill

Then the steam train's rolling by



.

Listen, I have got my hands on the wheel

Someone's got to see us

Taking all the train's got to steal away

Watch me as I sign up a deal

With Nike and Adidas

All the world is starting to feel the waves



From the steam train coming down the track

Better watch your step

Better watch your back

Better keep your eyeballs open, Jack

When the steam train's rolling by



Steam train chuggin' down the hill

If you want to live

Better don't stand still

He's on the move

And he's in for the kill

And the steam train's rolling by



You don't know me. The last time I saw my father I was five years old.

He hadn't been home for two months. He came into the

apartment at 3 o'clock in the morning, set fire to the drapes and carpets

and then woke up me and my sister, carried us outside,

then walked away while we watched the house burn down.

You don't know me, but you will.



A new world just across the river

A new world where I'll have it all

A new world just around the corner

Here it comes

Here it comes

You don't know me. There were 12 boys in my 5th grade class at Sojourner Truth.

4 of them are in jail, 6 of them are dead, and

Gordon Conners works at Twin Donut on 125th Street.

You don't know me, but you will.
