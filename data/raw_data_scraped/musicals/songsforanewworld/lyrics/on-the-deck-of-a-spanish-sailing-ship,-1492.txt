On The Deck Of A Spanish Sailing Ship, 1492


Lord, we take this journey

To find a promised land

Lord, we take this journey

To find a promised land

And we believe in your power

We believe in your power

We believe in your power

But the end is so close,

So close at hand



Lord, these men are hungry

There just hasn't been enough

And the journey's been so rough

And, Lord, these men are hurting

They implore me to go back

As the planks beneath them crack



And I know it's my responsibility

But I'm starving too

And I hurt, I do

And I'm lost

I believe in my responsibility

But I need to see

If the fruits will be worth the cost



So I'm begging you, Lord

You gotta stop, take a look

At your children who believe in this promised land

Have mercy, Lord

Stop their suffering and their woe

Stop, shine your light on these children

Who have faith in your guiding hand

I'm just begging Lord

?Cause there's no place else to go

I am unworthy, Lord



Lord, this ship is crowded

And the men are tired an worn

But another baby's born

And, Lord, this ship is broken

And the sails are ripped and old

But the winds are rough and cold



And I know it's my responsibility

When I ride the sea

These men turn to me for a sign

I believe in my responsibility

But I can't be sure

When it's time for your light to shine

So I'm begging you, Lord

To make it stop

Take a look at your children

Who believe in this promised land

Have mercy, Lord

Give a sign to let us know

Stop, shine your light on these children

Who have faith in your guiding hand

I'm just begging, Lord

?Cause there's no place else to go



Lord, save this child

I am not strong enough

I am not strong enough

Lord, save my soul

I am unworthy



Lord, take my hand

I am not strong enough

I am not strong enough

Lord, take my heart

I am unworthy



Lord, give me hope

I am not strong enough

I am not strong enough

Lord, give me light

I am unworthy

I am unworthy



Stop, take a look

At the children, at the children

Who believe in this promised land

You gotta have mercy, Lord

Have mercy, Lord

Give us strength so that we can grow



Stop, shine your light

On these children who have faith in the divine



I'm just begging, Lord

I'm just begging you, Lord

I know I am unworthy

But there's no place else to go



A new world calls across the ocean

A new world calls across the ocean

A new world calls across the sky
