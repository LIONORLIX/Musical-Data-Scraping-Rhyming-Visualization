I'm Not Afraid Of Anything


Jennie's afraid of water

I mean she swims so well

But still

She's afraid of water

And so she won't go near the sea

Not me



Katie's afraid of darkness

I mean she sleeps and all

But still

She's afraid of darkness

So when the lights are out she has to hold my hand

I don't understand



I'm not afraid of anything

Be it mountains, water, dragons, dark or sky

I'm not afraid of anything

Tell me where's the challenge if you never try

So watch me fly

I'm not afraid



Daddy's afraid of babies

I mean he got through me, but now

He's afraid of babies

Guess he's scared of what they'll be

Not me



And Mama's afraid of crying

You know she tries to hold it in

But she's afraid of crying

And she can look at me with tears stuck in her eye

And I don't know why



I'm not afraid of anything

Be it growing old or going out of style

I'm not afraid of anything

Who would give up what they want without a trial

Another mile

I'm not afraid



And I feel the calling of adventure

And I hear the ringing in my ear

The lights are glaring

Trumpets blaring

I'm right here

And I hear the calling of tomorrow

And I feel the stirring in my bones

And David loves me

He's afraid to hold me



Listen to the calling of excitement

Can you feel the pounding of my heart

The lights are ready

Pulse is steady

I can start



Never stop the calling of a challenge

Blessing on the water and the stones

And David loves me

He's afraid to tell me

David loves me

He's afraid to trust me

He's afraid to hold me

And he'll always be

He's afraid of me



And I'm not afraid of anyone

I am sure to win with anyone at all

I'm not afraid of anyone

Not a soul alive can get behind this wall

So let them call

And watch them fall

?Cause after all

I'm not afraid
