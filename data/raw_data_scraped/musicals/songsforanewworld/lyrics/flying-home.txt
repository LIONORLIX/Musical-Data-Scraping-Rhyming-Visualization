Flying Home


The angel's called you

To leave this land

My work is finished

My work is finished

The angel's command



I'll come to join you

Reach out your hand

And I'll be flying home

Straight into your arms

And I'll be flying home

Carry me on

Carry me on

And I'm flying home



The angel's called me

To shut the door

We're almost touching

Almost touching

Just one minute more



I'll hear you call me

Just like before

And I'll be flying home

Straight into your arms

And I'll be flying home

Carry me on

Carry me on

And I'm flying home



Carry me on

Speak my name

And I'll rise into the sky

Carry me on

And I'll taste the heavens

Carry me on

And my shame and my fear

Will pass me by

I'm rising, rising



Say the words

And I'll lift into the air

Carry me on

And I'll stay forever

I'm ready Father

Take my hand

I'm ready Father

To fly, to fly

Fly



I'm flying home

Straight into your arms

I'm flying home,

Carry me on

Carry me on

Carry me on

Carry me on

Carry me on

Carry me on



I'm flying, how high I'm flying, home

Straight into your arms

I'm flying how

Carry me on

Carry me on

And I'm flying home
