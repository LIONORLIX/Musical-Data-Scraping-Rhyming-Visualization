Opening: The New World


A new world calls across the ocean

A new world calls across the sky

A new world whispers in the shadows

Time to fly, time to fly



It's about one moment

The moment before it all becomes clear

And in that one moment

You start to believe there's nothing to fear

It's about one second

And just when you're on the verge of success

The sky starts to change

And the wind starts to blow

And you're suddenly a stranger

There's no explaining where you stand

And you didn't know

That you sometimes have to go

?Round an unexpected bend

And the road will end

In a new world



A new world calls for me to follow

A new world waits for my reply

A new world holds me to a promise

Standing by, standing by



It's about one moment

That moment you think you know where you stand

And in that one moment

The things that you're sure of slip from your hand

And you've got one second

To try to be clear, to try to stand tall

But nothing's the same

And the wind starts to blow

And you're suddenly a stranger

In some completely different land

And you thought you knew

But you didn't have a clue

That the surface sometimes cracks

To reveal the tracks

To a new world



You have a house in the hills

You have a job on the coast

You find a lover you're sure you believe in

You've got a pool in the back

You get to the part of your life

You hold the ring in your hand



But then the earthquake hits

And the bank closes in

Then you realize you didn't know anything

Nobody told you the best way to steer

When the wind starts to blow



And you're suddenly a stranger (All of a sudden)

You life is different than you planned

And you'll have to stay ?til you somehow find a way

To be sure of what will be

Then you might be free



A new world crashes down like thunder

A new world charging through the air

A new world just beyond the mountain

Waiting there, waiting there



A new world shattering the silence

There's a new world I'm afraid to see

A new world louder every moment

Come to me, come to me
