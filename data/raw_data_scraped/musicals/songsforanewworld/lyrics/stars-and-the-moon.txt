Stars And The Moon


I met a man without a dollar to his name

Who had no traits of any value but his smile

I met a man who had no yearn or claim to fame

Who was content to let life pass him for a while

And I was sure that all I ever wanted

Was a life like the movie stars led

And he kissed me right here, and he said,



"I'll give you stars and the moon and a soul to guide you

And a promise I'll never go

I'll give you hope to bring out all the life inside you

And the strength that will help you grow.

I'll give you truth and a future that's twenty times better

Than any Hollywood plot."

And I thought, "You know, I'd rather have a yacht."



I met a man who lived his life out on the road

Who left a wife and kids in Portland on a whim

I met a man whose fire and passion always showed

Who asked if I could spare a week to ride with him

But I was sure that all I ever wanted

Was a life that was scripted and planned

And he said, "But you don't understand ?



"I'll give you stars and the moon and the open highway

And a river beneath your feet

I'll give you day full of dreams if you travel my way

And a summer you can't repeat.

I'll give you nights full of passion and days of adventure,

No strings, just warm summer rain."

And I thought, "You know, I'd rather have champagne."



I met a man who had a fortune in the bank

Who had retired at age thirty, set for life.

I met a man and didn't know which stars to thank,

And then he asked one day if I would be his wife.

And I looked up, and all I could think of

Was the life I had dreamt I would live

And I said to him, "What will you give?"



"I'll give you cars and a townhouse in Turtle Bay

And a fur and a diamond ring

And we'll be married in Spain on my yacht today

And we'll honeymoon in Beijing.

And you'll meet stars at the parties I throw at my villas

In Nice and Paris in June."



And I thought, "Okay."

And I took a breath

And I got my yacht

And the years went by

And it never changed

And it never grew

And I never dreamed

And I woke one day

And I looked around

And I thought, "My God...

I'll never have the moon."
