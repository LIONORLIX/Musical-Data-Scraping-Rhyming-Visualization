The World Was Dancing


"Tomorrow you'll be here my love

Tomorrow we'll be one

Tomorrow we can follow through

On all that we've begun

Tomorrow we'll be free my love

We'll never be afraid"



Daddy bought a store out in Pittsburgh

And he called his boss and quit

And we tried to convince him

The risk was too much

But he still was convinced

Of his own Midas Touch

So he bought this piece of shit



I packed up and went off to Princeton

With a scholarship in hand

Well, I'd call up my folks every weekend or so

And I'd tell them how college was helping me grow

Which was just what they had planned



And then I met this girl named Amy

With a smile as bright as day

And while the Pirates beat the Orioles

We fell in love and danced the night away



"Tomorrow we'll be free my love

We'll never be afraid"



And we were dancing

The world was dancing

Dancing



Daddy lost his shirt out in Pittsburgh

As my sophomore year rolled round

Well he had hired some schmuck

That he knew from the war

And one weekend he left him

In charge of the store

And he burned it to the ground



And then I met this girl named Lisa

On a couch at Alpha-Mu

But then she transferred to Macalester

So it's just as well that Amy never knew



"Tomorrow we'll be free my love

We'll never be afraid"



And we were dancing

The world was dancing

Dancing



Daddy got his job back that summer

So he hid his pride and pain

And they threw him a party

And baked him a cake

And they sent me a ticket

To come winter break

But I guess I missed the plane



And since I'd spent so long with Amy

We got ourselves engaged

But then I thought

I can't,

This can't be right

?Cause dreams get burned down overnight

I wasn't quite prepared to choose,

To take that risk and maybe lose

And since I couldn't tell her why

I hit the road

And never said goodbye



"Tomorrow you'll be here my love

Tomorrow we'll be one

Tomorrow we can follow through

On all that we've begun

Tomorrow we'll be free me love

We'll never be afraid"



And I was dancing

And they were dancing

The world was dancing

Dancing
