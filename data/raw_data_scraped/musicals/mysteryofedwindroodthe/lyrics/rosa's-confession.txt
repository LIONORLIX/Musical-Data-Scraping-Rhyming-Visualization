Rosa's Confession


Rosa:

Were you so blind? You could not see? I killed him, yes!

And it was wonderful to do, I do confess!

To have him done, to do him in, to see it through?

You surely know by now I meant to murder you!



Thought you I was so blind

As not to know your mind:

Of what intent each compliment you claimed you meant as kind.

To feel myself unrobed and probed

With every movement of your eyes?

Oh, but realize!

A child can go quite mad,

And not know good from bad

And calmly plan to kill a man, and feel but only glad.

To rid herself, to bid herself a murderous goodbye?

Not Edwin who

I sought, but you!

I meant for you to die!



But the night was far from bright,

Thick with wet and thunder.

Thatching fell, dispatched from hell,

Is it yet a wonder?

Could not see the arms of me

Stretched out with scarf in hand.

Saw your coat and tied Ned?s throat

Just like a deadly wedding band?



So long a time

They?ve thought

That I?m a Dresden doll,

Quite na?ve,

But I believe

This pain, my brain,

More tortured than they might conceive!

With these late additions,

I have now revealed

Murderous admissions

Hitherto concealed?

Damn you all, I say,

You let him drive me mad!

Madness led to this;

No good can come from bad!

No good, no good can come from bad!
