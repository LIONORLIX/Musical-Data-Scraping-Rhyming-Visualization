Don't Quit While You're Ahead


Puffer:

Once I bet my last ten pence - and won

Twice as rich then, friends said, "Call it done!"

"How sad", I said.

"So that's your wildest dream, eh, then...

Twenty pence instead of ten?"

I doubled up my bet again!



In life you start the same as when you're done:

If you lose, you're just where you've begun -

If you've won, don't quit while you're ahead,

Just press your blessed luck instead!



Datchery:

Don't try to think what move might be best;

Use the heart that beats within your breast.

Never rest! Don't quit while you're ahead.

Sing out:



Datchery & Puffer:

"There's more in store for me!"



Bazzard & Durdles:

I see my dream ship fin'lly comin' in

Like a steam ship anch'rin in to win!



Puffer & Datchery:

Lift your chin! Remember what I said

Don't quit while you're ahead, let go!



Rosa & Helena:

I know there must be love that's yet to be

Only just three winks away from me

Hopefully...



Puffer, Datchery, Bazzard & Durdles:

Don't quit while you're ahead!

Don't worry how you tread! Who cares?



Neville & Crisparkle:

And there's the chance! One pipe dream

that is mine

A romance just ripe on the vine



Rosa & Helena:

Don't resign!

Neville, Crisparkle, Rosa, Helena, Alice & Beatrice:

No victor ever fled!



Puffer, Datchery, Bazzard, Durdles:

Don't quite you're ahead to stay!



All:

Ta-ray- ta-rah!

Boom!

Bang it, bash it, Hoo-ray-ha-rah!

Boom!

Clang it, clash it, oo-la-dee-dah!

Don't quite while you're ahead!

Don't say "I'm off to bed, farewell!"



Jasper:

Full well I know!

Don't let the moment go to waste

Not with the vic'try close enough to taste!

Chairman & Jasper:

Heed the call with all due haste!



All:

For God's own sake!



So raise the stake, you struck a lucky vein!

Never break through any lucky chain!

The refrain: "Don't quit while you're ahead,"

As eas'ly done as said, you'll see:



Ta-rah-ta-ree!

Boom!

Bang it, bash it, oo, glory be!

Boom!

Clang it, clash it, oo-lah-dee-dee!

Don't quit while you're ahead

Sing out, "There's more in store for me!"
