Two Kinsmen


Drood:

My dearest Uncle Jack!



Jasper:

My dearest Nephew Ned!



Both:

A life without your friendship

Would be life as good as dead!



Jasper:

The winds of hell may blow, but as you

well may know,

I'll heed your call, no need too small,

And face the fire below for you!



Drood:

For You!



Jasper:

For You!



Drood:

For You!



Both:

Two kinsmen, more than brothers, we

know no next of kin

and yet we know others closer 'neath

the skin.

The blood that flows between us, the

bonds that tie us twain;

Two kinsmen, when all others flee then we remain!



Jasper:

My dearest Nephew Ned!



Drood:

My dearest Uncle Jack!

If men say words against you,

I would make them take them back!

A loyal lad am I who'd be but glad to die,

If by my death one extra breath of life

for you I'd buy.

'Tis True!



Jasper:

'Tis true



Drood:

For You!



Jasper:

For You!

(Repeat Chorus)
