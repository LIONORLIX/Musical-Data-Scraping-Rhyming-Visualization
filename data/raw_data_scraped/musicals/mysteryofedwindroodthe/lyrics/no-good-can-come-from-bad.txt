No Good Can Come From Bad


Neville:

Sir I don't much like your tone, that supercilious sneer you wear!

Clear, you wear a finer cut than mine,

Ah but a waistcoat worn can soon be torn,

And faggots, too, 'til maggots feed on you!



Rosa:

Something in this speech seems ominous to me!



Helena:

Twin, don't over preach, pray promise this to me!



Crisparkle:

Praise to him divine! For this we should be glad!



Jasper:

Won't you try some wine?

All:

No good can come from bad!



Jasper:

My dearest Nephew Ned, I wish to wish you well!

The world is your before you just like -



Cook:

OYSTERS ON THE SHELL!



Drood:

Landless, (as you are and known),

Your blood is hot but less than pure!

Less, I'm sure, than we, your history would indicate

The past of some half-caste runs through your veins

Your crudeness thus explains,



Rosa:

Something sends a chill like feet upon my grave.



Helena:

Can my strength and will completely Neville save?



Crisparkle:

Could these words they say bring harm upon the lad?





Jasper:

Night must follow day!



All:

No good can come from bad!



Jasper:

My dearest, deepest friends, may

I propose a toast;

To Rosa Bud and Edwin Drood, three cheers -



Cook:

AND HERE'S THE ROAST!



Crisparkle:

How very blessed we are when oh so many starve!

Thy kingdom come, thy will be done -



Jasper:

WHICH ONE OF YOU WILL CARVE?



Neville & Drood:

Glances cut like blade through bone;

With daggers drawn I glare at you.

There at you who dare presume to stare at whom

I'd make my wife and share my life -

I'd see you dead before sweet Rosa wed.



Helena:

Fate waits near!

I feel it, I fear it!

We are friends and yet they'll not soon forget

Hearing Neville's threat, every epithet!



Crisparkle:

In younger days, I hungered for another:

Rosa's mother!

After Rosa's birth, she left this earth,

now dust is all I'm worth!



Rosa:

So long a time, they've thought that I'm a Dresden doll.

Quite naive, but I perceive these boys,

this noise more fright'ning

Than they might conceive.



Jasper:

As I stand by, take note:

Your throat sounds quite dry, this wine

should satisfy!



All:

With these new additions, there may be revealed

Murderous admissions otherwise concealed



Neville & Drood:

Fie on you, I curse!!! Full warning you

have had!



Helena & Rosa:

Bad must lead to worse,



All:

No good can come from bad! No good -

No good can come from bad!
