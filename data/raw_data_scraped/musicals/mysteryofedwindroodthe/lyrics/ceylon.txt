Ceylon


Helena:

Ceylon...Ceylon

By the Bengal Bay,



Neville:

East of Jaipur,

West of Mandalay!



Helena & Neville:

Agra...Patna...

Sholapur and Kolhapur and all,



Helena:

How far they are

From the High Street and the Market Hall



Drood:

It's all very well for you

To speak of this distant view,

But Rosa what's planned for me

Is grander than sand and sea!

This vista that's in my sight

Where I'll set the world alright

Awaits me...

It dominates me.



Drood:

It's perfectly fine for them

To sing of their minor gem,

But there is a role for me,

A goal I intend to see,

A vision that's clean and

Bright before me -

You cannot ignore me

I will soon be

Shaping and molding,

Holding fortune in my hand

And I'll improve and

Shake and move and

Change the very

Nature of the land



Helena & Neville:

Ceylon...Ceylon

Cross the Injun Seas

T'wards the Fjords of

Thornaby-on-Tees

Typhoons

Monsoons,

Break upon the

Coast of Malabar!

Quaking,

Shaking,

Change the way you are, hey!



Helena, Neville, & Ensemble:

Ceylon, Ceylon

By the Bengal Bay,

East of Jaipur, West of Mandalay!



Helena:

How warm are the winds of our Golden Isle!



Neville:

How cool are their words and how cold is their smile!



Both:

They wish us gone!

We'll be back someday Ceylon!



Drood, Jasper & Ensemble:

They've become a throat straight from Ceylon.



All:

Sail on to Ceylon! Hey!
