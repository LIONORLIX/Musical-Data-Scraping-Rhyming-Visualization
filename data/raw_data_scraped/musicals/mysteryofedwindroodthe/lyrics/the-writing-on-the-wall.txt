The Writing on the Wall


Drood:

I am Laz'rus, risen from the grave!

Quite alive you find me -

This tomb behind me

Is where I faced my closest shave!

When I struck my head against the street,

I was stunned, not stricken -

(Out plot doth thicken) -

For Jasper flew me off my feet



To the crypt,

I awoke in dark beyond belief,

And while all above me showed their grief,

I was screaming for my very breath,

Only moments from death.



You have no idea the sudden strength

That you feel within you,

The steel and sinew,

When fate stands smiling at arms-length.

I escaped! From Cloisterham I fled.

I did not return here.

'Til I could learn here

Just who in hell would wish me dead.



But more than that,

More than what solution fits this crime,

What I've learned is that life is bits of time,

And you fight for every tiny speck

When you're held by the neck:



I have read the writing on the wall,

And the greatest myst'ry

Is not the hist'ry

Of Jasper, Drood and one and all!



I have met my maker and returned!

What advice I'm giving

To all those living

Is just to learn what I have learned:



Life is dear.

There can be no vict'ry in defeat.

If our-numbered, beat a fast retreat

To the nearest shelter and dig in!

When you live, then you win!



Scratch and claw for every day you're worth!

Make them drag you screaming from life, keep dreaming

You'll live forever here on earth.



I have read the writing on the wall,

And it's clearly spelled out

For those who've held out

That holding on to life is all.



Is it clear?

If you hear my voice, then you're alive.

What a bloody marvel we survive,

When you think of every risk we face

In our mad human race!



I have read the writing on the wall!

Try to live forever

And give up never

The fight - you'll need the wherewithal!

Can't you heed the lightning

As I plead.

Inciting you to read the writing on the wall!
