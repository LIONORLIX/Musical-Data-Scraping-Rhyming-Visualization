Perfect Strangers


Rosa:

If we were perfect strangers,

How perfect life could be!



Drood:

I'd know if I adore you -

You'd know if you love me,

Too much we've seen together to judge

the view.



Rosa:

Too much we've been together...



Drood:

And I assumed the future -



Rosa:

And I presumed that you were there,

And yet I wondered where we met.



Drood:

If we were perfect strangers,

I'd find my way with ease.



Drood & Rosa:

I'd know the path before me, the forest

from the trees.



Drood:

Could life be real without you?

You're always there.



Rosa:

How do I feel about you?



Drood:

I care...



Rosa:

Too near to touch you!

My dearest Ned, how much you mean to me...



Drood:

But are we lovers, how would we know it?

How could we feel it?

How would we show it?



Rosa:

How much you've been to me!

Drood and Rosa:

If we were perfect strangers

I might have loved you perfectly...
