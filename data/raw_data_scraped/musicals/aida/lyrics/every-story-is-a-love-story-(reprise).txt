Every Story is a Love Story (Reprise)


Amneris:

From deep within a tomb

A gentle light still shone

Showing me my path

As I ascended to the throne

Certain in my heart

That ancient wars must cease

The lovers' deaths gave birth

to a reign of peace



And their story

And my journey

And the lesson they provide

Draw their strength and inspiration

from a love that never dies
