Every Story Is a Love Story


Amneris:

Every story, tale or memoir

Every saga or romance

Whether true or fabricated

Whether planned or happenstance



Whether sweeping through the ages

Casting centuries aside

Or a hurried brief recital

Just a thirty-minute ride



Whether bright or melancholy

Rough and ready, finely spun

Whether with a thousand players

Or a lonely cast of one



Every story, new or ancient

Bagatelle or work of art

All are tales of human failing

All are tales of love at heart



This is the story

Of a love that flourished

In a time of hate



Of lovers no tyranny could separate

Love set into motion on the Nile's shore

Destiny ignited by an act of war



Egypt saw the mighty river as its very heart and soul

Source of life for all her people

That only Egypt could control

Destruction of her southern neighbor justified

Nubia exploited, left with little more than pride
