Elaborate Lives (Reprise)


We all lead such elaborate lives

Wild ambitions in our sights

How an affair of the heart suvives

Days apart and hurried nights

Seems quite unbelievable to me

I don''t want to live like that

Seems quite unbelievable to me

I don't want to love like that

I just want our time to be

Slower and gentler,wiser, free



We all live in extravagant times

Playing games

we all can't win

Unintended emotional crimes

take some out take others in



Too many choices tear us apart

I don't want to live like that

Too many choices tear us apart

I don't want to love like that

I just want to keep your heart

May this confession be the start



I know you'll give me courage

to face what I must face

with all these complications

in another time and place



Aida and Radames:

We all lead such elaborate lives

We don't know whose words are true

An affair of the heart survives

All the pain the world can do



Radames:

I'm so tired of all we're going through

I don't want to live like that



Aida:

I'm so tired of all we're going through

I don't want to love like that

I just want to be with you

Now and forever peaceful,true
