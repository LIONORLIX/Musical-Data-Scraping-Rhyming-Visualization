My Strongest Suit (Reprise)


Amneris:

I may leave a great impression

As I race through a succession

Of the latest crazes, chase the newest fad

I feel better when beguiling

Find that fashion keeps me smiling

But in my heart I know it's rather sad



Aida:

That a life of great potential

Is dismissed, inconsequential



Amneris:

And only ever seen as being cute

So I'll flutter to deceive



Aida:

Oh no you must believe

That one day you're bound to find



Aida/Amneris:

A Stronger Suit
