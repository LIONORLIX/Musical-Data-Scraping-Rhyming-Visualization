How I Know You


Mereb:



I grew up in your hometown

At least began to grow

I hadn't got to my first shave

before the body blow

Egyptians in the courtyard



My family in chains

You witnessed our abduction

Which possibly explains

How I know you

How I know you



Before that fateful morning

My family enjoyed

A privileged existence

For my father was employed

As advisor to the King no less

Which surely rings a bell



For as your are his daughter

You probably can tell

How I know you

Yes I know you



Aida:



You know too much and what you say

Is better left unknown

And now I'm just a slave like you

Our lives our not our own



Mereb:



I never have abandoned

And nor I think could you

That spark of hope for freedom

No terror can subdue



Aida:



My only hope is silence

You've never seen my face



Mereb:



No you remain a princess

In any time or place



Aida:



You don't know me



Mereb:



Yes, I know you



Aida:



You don't know me



Mereb:



How I know you

How I know you
