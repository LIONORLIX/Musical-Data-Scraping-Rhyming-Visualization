Radames' Letter


Radames:



I'm sorry for everything I've said

And for anything I forgot to say

When things get so complicated

I stumble at best muddle through

I wish that our lives could be simple

I don't want the world only you



Oh I wish I could tell you this face to face

But there's never the time never the place

So this letter will have to do

I love you....
