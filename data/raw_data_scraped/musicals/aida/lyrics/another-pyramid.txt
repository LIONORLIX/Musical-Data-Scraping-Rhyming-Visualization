Another Pyramid


Zoser:



While you've been away cavorting

Matters here have moved apace

Now I need you home supporting

All the plans I've put in place



First of all this means your wedding

You'll recall your future bride

For the way that Pharaoh's heading

Time's no longer on our side



According to the hawk god, Horus

Our most regal invalid

Is not that much longer for us

Build another pyramid!



There are many who'll be tearful

As our leader fades away

But our architects are cheerful

And each dog must have its day



If our country is to flourish

Then my son must take the lead

Be our inspiration, nourish

All our hopes our dreams our creed



Soon our monarch will have filled a

Tomb just like his fathers did

Summon Egypt's greatest builders

Re: another pyramid



Ministers:

Build it, build it

Another pyramid



There will be a time for mourning

But for now put plans on hold



Ministers:

Hold



For I give the nation warning

That before the corpse is cold



Ministers:

Cold



We'll extend fair Egypt's power

Egypt's glory strength and style

We shall have our finest hour

Far beyond the mighty Nile



He must have a vault that's grand by

Any standards, floor to lid

Put five thousand slaves on stand by

Build another pyramid!



Ministers:



Build it, build it

Build it, build it

Build it, build it

Build it-



Build it, build it

Build it-



Zoser:

He must have a vault that's grand by

Any standards, floor to lid

Put five thousand slaves on stand by

Build another pyramid!
