Elaborate Lives


Radames:

We all lead such elaborate lives

wild ambitions in our sights

How an affair of the heart survives

days apart and hurried nights

Seems quite unbelievable to me

I don't want to live like that

seems quite unbelievable to me

I don't want to love like that

I just want our time to be

slower and gentler, wiser,free



We all live in extravagant times

playing games we can't all win

Unintened emotional crimes

Take some out, take others in



I'm so tired of all were going through

I don't want to live like that

I'm so tired of all were going through

I don't want to love like that

I jsut want to be with you

Now and forever ,peaceful,true

This may not be the moment

to tell you face to face

But I could wait forever

for the perfect time and place



Aida & Radames:

We all lead such elaborate lives

We don't know whose words are true

Strangers, lovers, husbands, wives

Hard to know who's loving who



Aida:

Too many choices tear us apart

I don't want to live like that



Radames:

Too many choices tear us apart

I don't want to love like that

I just want to touch your heart

May this confession



Radames and Aida:

be the start
