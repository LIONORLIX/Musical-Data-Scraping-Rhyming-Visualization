I Know the Truth


Amneris:

How did I come to this?

How did I slip and fall?

How did I throw half a lifetime away

Without any thought at all?



This should have been my time

It's over, it never began

I closed my eyes to so much for so long

and I no longer can



I try to blame it on fortune

Some kind of shift in a star

But I know the truth and it haunts me

it's flown just a little too far

I know the truth and it mocks me

I know the truth and it shocks me

It's flown just a little too far.



Why do I want him still?

Why when there's nothing there?

How to go on with the rest of my life

To pretend I don't care

This should've been my time

It's over-It never began

I closed my eyes to so much for so long

and I no longer can



I try to blame it on fortune

Some kind of twist in my fate

But I know the truth and it haunts me

I learned it a little too late



Oh I know the trth and it mocks me

I know the truth and it shocks me

I learned it a little too late

Too late
