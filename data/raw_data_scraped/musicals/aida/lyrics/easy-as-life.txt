Easy as Life


Aida:

This is the moment when the gods expect me

To beg for help but I won't even try

I want nothing in this world but myself to protect me

But I won't lie down, roll over and die

All I have to do is to forget how much I love him

All I have to do is put my longing to one side

Tell myself that love's an ever-changing situation

Passion would have cooled and all the magic would have died

It's easy, it's easy

All I have to do is to pretend I never knew him

On those very rare occasions when he steals into my heart

Better to have lost him when the ties were barely binding

Better the contempt of the familiar cannot start

It's easy, It's easy

Until I think about him as he was when I last touched him

And how he would have been were I to be with him today

Those very rare occasions don't let up they keep on coming

All I ever wanted and I'm throwing it away

It's easy, it's easy as life

But then I saw the faces of a worn , defeated people

A father and a nation who won't let a coward run

is this how the gods reward the faithful through the ages ?

Forcing us to prove the hardest thing we've done

Are easy

So easy

And though I'll think about him til the earth draws in around me

And though I choose to leave him for another kind of love

There is no denial, no betrayal but redemption

Redeemed in my own eyes and in the pantheon above

It's easy

It's easy as life

It's easy as life

It's easy as life
