I Like Life


Ghost of Christmas Present:

Ebenezer Scrooge

The sins of man are huge

A neverending symphony

Of villainy and infamy

Duplicity, deceit, and subtefuge

And no one's worse than Ebenezer Scrooge

Though man's a handy candidate for Hell

I must admit life sometimes has it's brighter side as well



I like life

Life likes me

Life and I fairly fully agree

Life is fine

Life is good

'Specially mine, which is just as it should be

I like pouring the wine and why not?

Life's a pleasure that I deny not



I like life

Here and now

Life and I made a mutual vow

'Till I die

Life and I

We'll both try to be better somehow

And if life were a woman

She would be my wife



Scrooge

Why?



Ghost of Christmas Present

Why?

Because I like life!



Scrooge

That's all very well for you

But I hate life



Ghost of Christmas Present

Nonsense man!

Why?



Scrooge

Because life hates me, that's why!



Ghost of Christmas Present

Oh, Scrooge, you're an even bigger fool than I took you for!

You've had over sixty years on this planet

And during your long, miserable, miserly, selfish existence

You haven't even learned how to live

Now listen to me



I like life

Well, go on



Scrooge

I like life



Ghost of Christmas Present

That's better!

Life likes me



Scrooge

Life likes me



Ghost of Christmas Present

Good, good

I make life a perpetual spree



Scrooge

A perpetual spree



Ghost of Christmas Present

Eating food



Scrooge

Drinking wine



Ghost of Christmas Present

Thinking who'd like the privelege to dine me



Scrooge

I like drinking the drink I'm drinking



Ghost of Christmas Present

That's better, Scrooge!

And I like thinking the thoughts I'm thinking



I like songs

I like dance

I hear music and I'm in a trance



Scrooge

Tra-la-la



Ghost of Christmas Present

Oom-pah-pah



Ghost of Christmas Present and Scrooge

Chances are we shall get up and prance



Ghost of Christmas Present

Where there's music and laughter

Happiness is rife



Scrooge

Why?



Ghost of Christmas Present

Why?

Because I like life!



Ghost of Christmas Present and Scrooge

Where there's music and laughter

Happiness is rife

Why?

Because I like life!



Ghost of Christmas Present

Come on, Scrooge, we're going visiting

You're in for a few surprises



Drinking life

That's the thing

Makes a man want to suddenly sing

Sing and dance

And perchance

Seeing life from a different stance

When you learn how to live it

Life is free of strife

That is why I like life!



That's the secret of living



Scrooge

Any man can fly!



Ghost of Christmas Present

Why?

Because I like life!
