Father Christmas


Urchins

Father Christmas

Father Christmas

He's the meanest man in the whole wide world

In the whole wide world

You can feel it



He's a miser

He's a skinflint

He's a stingy lout

Leave your stocking out

For your Christmas gift and he'll steal it



It's a shame

He's a villain

What a game

For a villain to play

On Christmas day



After Christmas

Father Christmas

Will be just as mean as he's ever been

And I'm here to say

We should all send Father Christmas

On his merry Christmas way
