Make the Most of this World


Marley

See the phantoms filling the sky around you

They astound you I can tell

These inhabitants of hell

Poor wretches whom the hand of heaven ignores

Beware

Beware

Beware

Lest their dreadful fate be yours



Make the most of this world

For the next world is worse

If you think life is miserable now

That the life to come is better somehow

You had better put your thinking in reverse

And make the most of this world

For the next world is far, far worse



Phantoms

Make the most of this life

The next life's a curse

The man who kicks the present aside

In a quest for things life doesn't provide

Had better know now his theory is perverse

Make the most of this life



Marley

For the next life is far, far worse

Let's talk about heaven a minute

Men dream of it from birth

Heaven, you idiot

You're in it on earth



Phantoms

Make the most of living

For dying is worse

At times you'll say life isn't worthwile

But there's more to life than travelling in style



Marley

It's better to walk than ride inside a hearse



Marley and Phantoms

So make the most of this world

Embrace the universe



Marley

For I guarantee that the next world

Is far, far, far, far worse
