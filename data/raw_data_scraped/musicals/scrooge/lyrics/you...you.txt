You...You


Scrooge

You...

You were new to me



Young Ebenezer

You...

You were Spring

You...

You were true to me



Scrooge

You...

You were everything



Young Ebenezer

You...

You were good for me



Scrooge

You were my day



Young Ebenezer

Did all you could for me



Scrooge

I let you go away

And now I can see

Now you're a dream gone by



Scrooge and Young Ebenezer

Oh how could there be

Such a fool as I



Young Ebenezer

I who must travel on

What hope for me?



Scrooge

Dream where my past has gone

Live with a memory



Young Ebenezer

You...

My only hope



Scrooge

You...

My only love



Scrooge and Young Ebenezer

You...

You...

You...
