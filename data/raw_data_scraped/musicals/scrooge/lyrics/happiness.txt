Happiness


Young Ebenezer

They say happiness is a thing you can't see

A thing you can't touch



Isabel

I disagree

Happiness is standing beside me

I can see him

He can see me

Happiness is whatever you want it to be

Happiness is a high hill

Will I find it?

Yes, I will

Happiness is a tall tree

Can I climb it?

Watch and see



Scrooge

They say happiness is the folly of fools

Pity poor me

One of the fools



Young Ebenezer

Happiness is smiling upon me

Walking my way

Sharing my day



Young Ebenezer and Isabel

Happiness is whatever you want it to be



Isabel

Happiness is a bright star

Are we happy?



Young Ebenezer

Yes, we are



Isabel

Happiness is a clear sky



Young Ebenezer and Isabel

Give me wings and let me fly



Isabel

Let me fly



Young Ebenezer and Isabel

For happiness is whatever you want it to be



Scrooge

Yes, happiness is whatever you want it to be
