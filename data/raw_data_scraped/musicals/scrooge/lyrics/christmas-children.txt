Christmas Children


Bob Cratchit

Christmas children peep into Christmas windows

See a world as pretty as a dream



Kathy

Christmas trees and toys



Tiny Tim

Christmas hopes and joys



Bob Cratchit

Christmas puddings rich with Christmas cream

Christmas presents shine in the Christmas windows

Christmas boxes tied with pretty bows



Kathy

Wonder what's inside



Tiny Tim

What delights they hide



Bob Cratchit

But 'till Christmas morning

No one knows



Kathy

Won't it be exciting if it snows



Kathy and Tiny Tim

I suppose that children everywhere

Will say a Christmas prayer



Bob Cratchit

'Till Santa brings

Their Christmas things



Christmas children live in a Christmas daydream

Waiting for the magic to unfold



Tiny Tim

Wondrous things we'll eat



Kathy

Every Christmas treat



Bob Cratchit

Rich or not a Christmas pot of gold

Hypnotizes children young and old



I suppose that children everywhere

Will say a Christmas prayer

'Till Santa brings

Their Christmas things



Christmas children hunger for Christmas morning

Christmas day's a wonder to behold

Young ones' dreams come true

Not so young ones too

I believe that story we've been told

Christmas is for children young and old
