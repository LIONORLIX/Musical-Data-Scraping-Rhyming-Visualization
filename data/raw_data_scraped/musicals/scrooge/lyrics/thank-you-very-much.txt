Thank You Very Much


Tom Jenkins

Ladies and gentlemen

On behalf of all the people who have assembled here

I would merely like to mention if I may

That our unanimous attitude

Is one of lasting gratitude

For what our friend has done for us today

And therefore I would simply like to say



Thank you very much!

Thank you very much!

That's the nicest thing that anyone's ever done for me

I may sound Double-Dutch

But my delight is such

I feel as if a losing war's been won for me

And if I had a flag I'd hang my flag out

To add a sort of final victory touch

But since I left my flag at home

I'll simply have to say

Thank you very, very, very much!



Company

Thank you very, very, very much!



Tom Jenkins

Thank you very much!

Thank you very much!

That's the nicest thing that anyone's ever done for me

It sounds a bit bizarre

But things the way they are

I feel as if another life's begun for me



Company

And if I had a cannon I would fire it

To add a sort of celebration touch

But since I left my cannon at home

I'll simply have to say



Scrooge

Thank you very, very, very much!



Company

Thank you very, very, very much!



Thank you very much!

Thank you very much!

That's the nicest thing that anyone's ever done for me

It isn't everyday

Good fortune comes my way

I never thought the future would be fun for me

And if I had a bugle I would blow it

To add a sort of 'ow's-your-father touch

But since I left my bugle at home

I'll simply have to say

Thank you very, very, very much



Scrooge

No, my friends, it is I who should be thankful to you!



Company

For he's a jolly good fellow

For he's a jolly good fellow



Scrooge

For I'm a jolly good fellow



Company

And so say all of us



Thank you very, very much

(Tom Jenkins: Thank you very much!)

Thank you very, very much

(Tom Jenkins: That's the nicest thing that anyone's ever done for me)

Thank you very, very much

(Tom Jenkins: The future looks all right)

Thank you very much

(Tom Jenkins: In fact it looks so bright)

Thank you very much

(Tom Jenkins: I feel as if they're polishing the sun for me)

Thank you very much

Thank you very much

Thank you very, very, very, very much



And if I had a drum I'd have to bang it!

To add a sort of rumty-tumty touch

But since I left my drum at home

I'll simply have to say

Thank you very, very, very much!

Thank you very, very, very much!
