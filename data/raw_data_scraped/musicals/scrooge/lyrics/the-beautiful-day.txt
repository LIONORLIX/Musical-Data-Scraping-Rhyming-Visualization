The Beautiful Day


Tiny Tim

On a beautiful day that I dream about

In a world I would love to see

Is a beautiful place where the sun comes out

And it shines in the sky for me

On this beautiful winter's morning

If my wish could come true somehow

Then the beautiful day that I dream about

Would be here and now



Cratchit Children

Then the beautiful day that I dream about

Would be here and now
