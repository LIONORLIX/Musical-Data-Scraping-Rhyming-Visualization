I'll Begin Again


Scrooge

I'll begin again

I will build my life

I will live to know

I fulfilled my life

I'll begin today

Throw away the past

And the future I build

Will be something that will last

I will take the time

That I have left to live

And I'll give it all

That I have left to give

I will live my days

For my fellow men

And I'll live in praise

Of that moment when

I was able to begin again



I'll begin again

I will change my fate

I will show the world

That it is not too late

I will never stop

While I still have time

'Till I stand at the top

Of the mountain I must climb

I will start anew

I will make amends

And I will make quite certain

That the story ends

On a note of hope

On a strong amen

And I'll thank the world

And remember when

I was able to begin again

I'll begin again!
