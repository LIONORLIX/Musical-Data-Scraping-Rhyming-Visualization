In an Instant / Way Back to Paradise


In an Instant



PRISONER 1:

In an instant,



PRISONER 2:

white man winked at you



PRISONER 3:

Hot sunshine



PRISONER 1:

In an instant,



PRISONER 2:

your hand trembled



PRISONER 3:

Cold fingers



PRISONERS 1, 2 & 3:

And you lost track of the afternoon

and time flew like a frightened thrush

and you were granting him favors

in an instant





Way Back to Paradise



MARIE CHRISTINE:

We are ruled by our brothers.

We are ruled by our husbands.

We jump at the voices of our masters

and do as they say.

We are bartered and traded

along with cattle and cotton.

We have to be beautiful

and it helps to have a dowry of some kind;

We have to show humility;

And have the presence of mind

to never complain.

And they say it's our fault

We were thrown out of Eden

to be turned into salt.

But there is a way back to paradise;

There is a way;

Study all men:

Learn what they lack.

Sweeten and stroke

before you attack.

Put up a front

then slip through the back;

Be on your way back to paradise.



LISETTE:

Oui, mam-zell'

Oui, mam-zell'



MARIE CHRISTINE:

Long ago back in Eden



LISETTE:

Eden.



MARIE CHRISTINE:

when we didn't need husbands,



LISETTE:

Husbands



MARIE CHRISTINE:

We danced to the voices in the Garden

and had our own way.



LISETTE:

Ou-ye mam-zell'...



MARIE CHRISTINE:

We were taught by mothers

By the river of Knowledge;

Our Garden was beautiful



LISETTE:

Beautiful



MARIE CHRISTINE:

Until the angels came to call,

And on the wings of jealousy

they brought down the fall

and gave the Garden to men.



LISETTE:

Ah



MARIE CHRISTINE:

Put it out of our touch.



LISETTE:

Ah



MARIE CHRISTINE:

We were thrown out of Eden



LISETTE:

Ah



MARIE CHRISTINE:

for knowing too much.

But there is a way back to paradise

There is a way

Bide your time



LISETTE:

Oui, mam-zell'



MARIE CHRISTINE:

Be clever and wise



LISETTE:

Oui, mam-zell'



MARIE CHRISTINE:

When you look at a man



LISETTE:

Oui, mam-zell'



MARIE CHRISTINE:

Look him dead in the eyes.



LISETTE:

Oui, mam-zell'



MARIE CHRISTINE:

Do not be seduced.

Tell him elegant lies.



BOTH:

Be on your way

Be on your way back to paradise.
