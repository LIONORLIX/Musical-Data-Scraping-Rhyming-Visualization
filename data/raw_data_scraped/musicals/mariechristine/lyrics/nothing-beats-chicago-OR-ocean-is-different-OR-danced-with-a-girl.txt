Danced With a Girl



DANTE

Danced with a girl in Savannah.

Wasn't half as pretty as you.

Danced with a woman in Augustine.

Wasn't half as pretty as you.

When I was stuck in a sandbar off of Cape Canaveral

I two-stepped with a widow for a whole long year.

She come aboard when we set sail,

Took it she was staying till she jumped ship with the

Purser somewhere ?round Cape Fear:

But she wasn?t half as pretty as you,

You

But you are more than pretty,

You?re possessing beauty, you?re possessing magic,

Far as I can see

You are more than pretty

It takes a lot to move me

And you move me, you move me, you move me

And I bet that you dance real good.

Come on and dance with me.

Come on and dance with me.



You are more than pretty

It takes a lot to move me,

Move me...
