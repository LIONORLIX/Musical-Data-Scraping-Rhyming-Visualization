Tout Mi Mi / He Is My Release / Miracles and Mysteries


LISETTE:

Tout mi mi a chez da tom-tom

She no sa voir nou cie-lo mam-zelle...



MARIE CHRISTINE:

He is my release

He is my beginning

He is my escape

He is my way back to paradise



MARIE CHRISTINES?S MOTHER



Will you fall under the spell of another?

?-cout?s Marie

Once you fall under the spell of another

You will lose yourself

As I lost myself

I lost myself to love, Marie

Will you lie for the sake of him?

And will you dream of anyone else but him?

There is no end to what you?ll do for him

For the miracles and mysteries in his eyes

The miracles and mysteries in his arms;

To enter paradise, you have to sacrifice

ev?ry reason, ev?ry privilege,

ev?ry caution, ev?ry heartbeat

for the miracles and mysteries of love



WOMEN IN PRISON (MARIE CHRISTINE?S MOTHER)

Miracles and mysteries in his eyes (Love)

Miracles and mysteries in his arms (Love)



MARIE CHRISTINE?S MOTHER (PRISONERS)

And nothing that you?ve learned

will help you once you?ve burned

with the power (Power)

and the pleasure (Pleasure)

and the hunger (Hunger)



MARIE CHRISTINE?S MOTHER and PRISONERS

and the danger of the miracles and mysteries of



MARIE CHRISTINE?S MOTHER

love.

Any pain he feels you will feel.

Any hurt he knows you will know.

I lost myself

Will you lose yourself?

Will you lose yourself, Marie?
