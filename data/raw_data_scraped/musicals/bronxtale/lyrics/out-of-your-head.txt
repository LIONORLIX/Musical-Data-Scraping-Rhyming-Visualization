Out of Your Head


CALOGERO

That girl right there

Am I the only one who see

Those lips, that hair

Those eyes that knock me to my knees

Don't look at her

They find out, they'll laugh at you

For sure



What's it matter?

She's not one of us

And you're just...

Out of your head if you think that this ever could be

You're dreaming

Go back to bed, you're out of your head

Girls like her don't happen to guys like me



JANE

That boy right there

I see him everywhere I go

He smiles, I stare

Could it be more, I just don't know



WOMEN

No. Don't be stupid



JANE

Told myself a million times before



WOMEN

No. Don't be foolish



JANE & WOMEN

He is not your kind

And you're just..

Out of your head if you think that this ever could be

You're dreaming

Go back to bed, you're out of your head

Boys like him don't happen



CALOGERO, JANE & WOMEN

And you're just...

Out of your head if you think that this ever could be

You're dreaming

Go back to bed, you're out of your head



JANE

Boys like him don't happen to girls like me



WOMEN

No

No



CALOGERO

Girls like her don't happen to guys like me



WOMEN

No

No



CALOGERO & JANE

Things like this don't happen



CALOGERO

And then she's there

The chance would never come again

I say a prayer

Take one deep breathe and count to ten

Then I know it

Something tells me she must feels the same

C don't blow it

Simply ask her name



I must be out of my head

But I've gotten as bad as can be

God help me. She's so fine

But it's crossing a line



Girls like her don't happen

Girls like her can't happen

Girls like her don't happen to guys like me
