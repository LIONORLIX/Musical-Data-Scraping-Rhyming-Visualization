Nicky Machiavelli

Let me tell you what he said

You wanna use the reigns of power

First you gotta use your head

Nicky knew all the angles

Nicky laid it out real clear

You gotta choose fear or love kid

You gotta choose love or fear

Nicky's number one secret

Was availability

That's why I'm here on this corner

Right where all the world can see

All my friends they sleep easy

Knowing that I'm always near

My enemies know it too though

It ain't about love it's fear

And as far as those friends go

Nick said just a real short leash

Treat me well, but eh not too well

Keep em in your debt, capiche?

Give em too much they won't need ya

Give too little and they'll sneer

You wanna know what to give em?

The answer ain't love it's fear

Franky, Tony and Jojo

Look at how it is with them

Sure you think those fella love me?

Think again says Nicky M.

I make a joke they start laughing

Hell they nearly stand and cheer

I'm funny, but I ain't that funny

That laughter ain't love it's fear

So then which one is better

Me I take my cues from nick

Kindness looks a lot like weakness,

Even when you spread it thick

Money can't buy you friendship

Love can always disappear

But fear is cash in the bank kid

Fear puts gas in your tank kid

And now you got Nicky to thank kid

Forget about love, choose fear

Listen now what I tell ya

This advice is you know who's

Love or fear

It's up to you kid

But you live with what you choose

Nicky told me his secret

I owe the guy my whole career

So now I think it's up to you kid

You're gonna choose love

Or fear
