I Like It


Everywhere I go

Up and down the street

Everyone's my buddy

They're fallin' at my feet

I'm more than a kid

I'm part of the gang

They know where I go

Who I'm with, and my name



They call me 'C'

And I like it

Cool as can be

And I like it



Walkin' tall

Feelin' fine

Belmont Avenue's mine (?)

And I like it



Guys down at the pool-hall

They're beggin' me to play

The kids up at the corner, steppin' outta my way (?)

The girls give me looks

That are sweeter than summer

And why, because I am a real up-and-comer



They call me 'C'

And I like it

They smile at me

And I like it



Things are good

Yes, they are

Life's a big cookie jar

And I like it



Just yesterday

They pushed me aside

Just yesterday

They all looked right through me

Suddenly, 'boom!'

The world knows who I am

Life's a carnival ride since Sonny happened to me



When I'm at the drugstore

A cola costs a dime (?)

Over at the newsstand

Free comics all the time

The grocer

The peddler

The whole neighborhood

Wherever I go

I know my money's no good



They call me 'C'

And I like it

Everything's free

And I like it



Got a style

Got a rep

Got a swing in my step

I got the cash and the crew

All because (_________)



Nothing will be quite the same

Starting with my new name

And I like it



Yeaaah, yeah

I like it

Yeaaaaah, yeah

I like it
