Overture


Mrs johnstone

Tell me it's not true

Say it's just a story



Narrator

So did y' hear the story

Of the johnstone twins?

As like each other as two new pins

Of one womb born, on the self same day,

How one was kept and one given away?



An' did you never hear how the johnstones died,

Never knowing that they shared one name,

Till the day they died, when a mother cried

My own dear sons lie slain.



An did y' never hear of the mother so cruel,

There's a stone in place of her heart?

Then bring her on and come judge for yourselves

How she came to play this part.
