The Council Chamber


Mrs johnstone

Mickey. Don't shoot eddie. He's your

Brother. You had a twin brother. I couldn't

Afford to keep both of you. His mother

Couldn't have kids. I agreed to give one of you away!



Mickey

You! You! Why didn't you give me away mam!

I could have been. I could have been him! No!



Narrator

And do we blame superstition for what came to pass?

Or could it be what we have come to know as class?

Did you ever hear the story of the johnstone twins,

As like each other as two new pins

How one was kept and one given away,

How they were born, and they died,

On the self same day?
