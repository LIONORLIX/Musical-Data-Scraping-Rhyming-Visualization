One Day in October


Narrator

It was one day in october when the sun began to fade,

And winter broke the promise that summer had just made

It was one day in october when the rain came falling down,

And someone said the bogey man was seen around the town.



Mickey

Mam. Linda's pregnant!



Mrs johnstone

Do you love her?



Mickey

Yeh!



Mrs johnstone

When's the weddin'?



Mickey

We thought, about a month.

Before christmas anyway.
