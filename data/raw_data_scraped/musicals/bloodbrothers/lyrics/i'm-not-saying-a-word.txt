I'm Not Saying a Word


Edward

If i could stand inside his shoes i'd say

How can i compare thee to a summer's day



Linda

Oh go away..



Edward

I'd take a page in all the papers

I'd announce it in the news

If it was the guy, if i was in his shoes



Linda

I'm not with you.



Edward

If i was him i'd bring you flowers

And ask you to dance

We'd while away the hours making

Future plans

For rainy days in country lanes

And trips to the sea

I'd just tell you that i love you

If it was me



But i'm not saying a word,

I'm not saying i care,

Though i would like you to know



That i'm not saying a word,

I'm not saying i care,

Though i would like you to know

If i was him i'd have to tell you

What i've kept in my heart

That even if we had to live

Some worlds apart

There would not beaday

In which i'd not think of you

If i was him, if i was him

That's what i do



But i'm not saying a word

I'm not saying i care

Though i would like you to know

That i'm not saying a word

I'm not saying i care

Though i would like you to know



Edward

But i'm not.



Linda

What?



Edward
