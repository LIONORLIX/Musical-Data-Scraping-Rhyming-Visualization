Marilyn Monroe


Mrs johnstone

Once i had a husband

You know the sort of chap,

I met him at a dance

And how he came on with the chat



Teddy boy

Y' dancin'. I think you're a bleedin' cracker.



Mrs johnstone

He said my eyes were deep blue pools

My skin as soft as snow



Teddy boy

Lovely.



Mrs johnstone

He told me i was sexier than marilyn monroe

And we went dancing

We went dancing.



Then, of course, i found

That i was six weeks overdue.



Teddy boy

Y' what !??



Mrs johnstone

We got married at the registry

An' then we had a "do".



Guests

Bring on the bevvies.



Mrs johnstone

We all had curly salmon sandwiches

An' how the ale did flow.



Guests

Cheers.



Mrs johnstone

They said the bride was lovelier than marilyn monroe



Guests

And we went dancing,

Yes, we went dancing.



Mrs johnstone

Then the baby came along

We called him



Teddy boy

Darren wayne.



Mrs johnstone

Then three months on i found that i was in the club again.



Teddy boy

I married a bleedin' rabbit.



Mrs johnstone

An' though i still fancied dancing

My husband wouldn't go.



Teddy boy

Get lost will y'.



Mrs johnstone

With a wife he said was twice the size of marilyn monroe



No more dancing

No more dancing.



By the time i was twenty-five

I looked like forty-two.

With seven hungry mouths to feed

And one more nearly due



Me husband, he walked out on me

A month or two ago



Teddy boy

Ta-ra.



Mrs johnstone

For a girl they say who looks a bit like marilyn monroe



And they go dancing

They go dancing



Yes, they go dancing

They go dancing.
