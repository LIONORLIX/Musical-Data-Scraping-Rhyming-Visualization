Secrets


Mrs lyons

Where did you get that... Locket from, edward?

Why do you wear it?



Edward

I can't tell you that, ma. I've explained, it's a

Secret, i can't tell you



Mrs lyons

But... But i'm your mother.



Edward

I know but i still can't tell you. It's just, just a secret,

Everybody has secrets, don't you have secrets?



Narrator

Did you really feel that you'd become secure

That time had brushed away the past

That there's no one by the window, no one

Knocking on your door

Did you believe that you were free at last

Free from the broken looking glass
