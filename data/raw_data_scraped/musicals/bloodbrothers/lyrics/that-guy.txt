That Guy


Mickey

If i was like him

I'd know all the right words



Edward

If i was like him

I'd know some real birds

Apart from those in my dreams

And in magazines

Just look at his hair



Mickey

His hair's dark and wavy



Edward

It just isn't fair



Mickey

Mine's the colour of gravy



Edward/mickey

Each part of his face

Is in just the right place, is

He laughing at me



Edward

At my nose, did he notice



Mickey

I should wear a brace



Edward

That i've got halitosis



Mickey/edward

When nature picked on me

She chose to stick on me



Edward

Eyes that don't match



Mickey

I've got ears that stand out



Edward/mickey

She picked the wrong batch

When she handed mine out

And then she attacked me

With permanent acne



Edward

I wish i was a bit like

Wish that i could score a hit like

Be justa little bit like



Mickey/edward

That guy

That guy



Mickey

I wish that i could be like

Just a little less like me



Edward

Like the kinda guy i see, like



Edward/mickey

That guy

That guy
