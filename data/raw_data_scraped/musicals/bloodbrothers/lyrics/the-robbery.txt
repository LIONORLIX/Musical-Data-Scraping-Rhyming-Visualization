The Robbery


Narrator

There's a full moon shining

And a joker in the pack

The dealer's dealt the cards,

And he won't take them back

There's a black cat stalking

And a woman who's afraid

That there's no getting off

Without the price being paid



Sammy

Don't mess about with me, pal... I said give!

Listen, it's not a toy y' know. We're not playin'

Games. Y' don't get up again if one of these hits

Y' ... What are you doin'? I said listen to me, i said...

Don't you touch that.. Listen.



Mickey

Sammy!



Narrator

There's a man lies bleeding on a garage floor.



Sammy

Ouick, get in the house an' bolt the bleeding door.



Narrator

And maybe, if you counted ten and kept your

Fingers crossed

It would all be just a game and then no-one

Would have lost



Mickey

You shot him, you shot him.



Sammy

I know i bloody did.



Mickey

You shot him. You shot him.



Sammy

Move, i've got to get this hid.
