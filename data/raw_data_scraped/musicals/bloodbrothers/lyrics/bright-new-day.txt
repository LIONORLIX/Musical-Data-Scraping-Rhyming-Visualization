A new destination

And no reputation following me

For our new address

"sixty five skelmersdale lane"



Sammy

Is that in the country, mother?



Donna marie

What's it like there?



Mrs johnstone

The air is so pure

You get drunk just by breathing,

And the washing stays clean on the line.

Where there's space for the

Kids the garden's so big,

It would take you a week

Just to reach the far side

Come on sammy mickey, now you've all gorra help 'em

Would you excuse us, we've gorra pack

We're movin' away



Neighbour

Oh,that's too bad!



Postman

Oh, isn't it sad



Policeman

Praise the lord, he has delivered us at last



Neighbour

We mustn't scoff!



Neighbour

The johnstones are off



All

Clap your hands

Grab your whistle

Give it a blast



Postman

Goodbye to the riff raff

The trash and the trouble



Neighbour

Goodbye to the scum and the scruff



Milkman

Wherever you're going

We hope you go knowing



All

That as far as you're going

Won't be far enough!



Mrs johnstone

Just pack the bags,

We're leavin' the rags,

The wobbly wardrobe,

Chest of drawers that never close.

The two legged chair, the carpet so bare.

You wouldn't see it if it wasn't for the holes.

Now that we're movin'



Now that we're improvin'

Let's just wash our hands of this lot

For it's no longer fitting, for me to be sitting

On a sofa, i know for a fact was knocked off



Policeman

Knocked off



Mrs johnstone

We might get a car,

Be all'lardie dah',

An' go drivin' out to the sands.



Linda

We're coming too!



Mrs johnstone

At the weekend,

A gentleman friend,

Might take me dancing

To the local bands

We'll have a front room

And then if it should happen,

That his holiness flies in from rome,

He can sit there with me,

Eating toast, drinking tea

In the sort of surroundings

That remind him of home



Mickey

It's like the country isn't it, mam?



Mrs johnstone

Ey we'll be all right out here son. Away from

The muck an' the dirt an' the bloody trouble

Eh, i could dance. Come here.



Mickey

Get off...



Mrs johnstone

Oh, bright new day,

We're movin' away,

We're startin' all over again.

Oh, bright new day,

We're goin' away,

Where nobody's heard of our name.



Sammy

Come on gang-

Let's go and play in that field,



Mrs johnstone

Mickey. An' what are you laughin' at?



Mickey

I'm not laughin'. I'm smilin'. I haven't seen you

Happy like this for ages.



Mrs johnstone

Well, i am happy now eh, jesus where's the others?



Mickey

They went into that field. Mam.

Mrs johnstone

Sammy sammy! Get off that bleedin' cow before

I kill you. That cow's a bull.



Mrs johnstone

Feel we can win an' then,

Live just like livin' should be.

A new destination,

An' no reputation following me.

We're goin' away oh, bright new day
