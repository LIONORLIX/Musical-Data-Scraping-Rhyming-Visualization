Shoes Upon the Table


Narrator

How swiftly those who've made a pact,

Can come to overlook the fact

Or wish the reckoning be delayed

But a debt is a debt, and must be paid.



Mrs lyons

You do know what they say about twins,

Secretly parted, don't you?



Mrs johnstone

What? What?



Mrs lyons

They say that if either twin learns that he was

One of a pair, they shall both immediately die.

It means, mrs johnstone that these brothers

Shall grow up, unaware of the other's

Existence they shall be raised apart and

Never, ever told what was once the truth. You

Won't tell anyone about this, mrs johnstone.

Because if you do, you will kill them



Narrator

Shoes upon the table

An' a spider's been killed.

Someone broke the lookin' glass

A full moon shinin'

An' the salt's been spilled.

You're walkin' on the pavement cracks

Don't know what's gonna come to pass.

Now y' know the devil's got your number,

Y' know he's gonna find y',

Y' know he's right behind y',

He's starin' through your windows

He's creeping down the hall.



Ain't no point in clutching

At your rosary

You're always gonna know what was done

Even when you shut your eyes you still see

That you sold a son

And you can't tell anyone

But y' know the devils got your number

Y' know he's gonna find y',

Y' know he's right behind y'

He's standin' on your step

And he's knocking at your door

He's knocking at your door,

He's knocking at your door.
