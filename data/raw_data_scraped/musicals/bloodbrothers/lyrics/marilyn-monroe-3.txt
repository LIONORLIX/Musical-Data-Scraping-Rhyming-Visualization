Marilyn Monroe 3


Mrs johnstone

The jury found him guilty

Sent him down for seven years

Though he acted like they gave him life,

He couldn't stop the tears.

And when we went to visit him

He didn't want to know,

It seems like jails sent him off the rails.

Just like marilyn monroe

His mind's gone dancing

Can't stop dancing



They showed him to a doctor

And after routine test

A prescription note the doctor wrote

For the chronically depressed.

And now the tears have stopped

He sits and counts the days to go

And treats his ills with daily pills

Just like marilyn monroe



They stop his mind from dancing

Stop it dancing



Linda

What are y' doin'?



Mickey

What? I'm takin' me tablet.



Linda

Listen, mickey i've told y' they're just junk.

You'll be home soon, mickey, and you should

Come off them.



Mickey

Why? I need... I need to take these.



Linda

Listen, mickey, you've...



Mickey

No! See, he says, the doctor, he said.



Linda

What did he say?



Mickey

He said, about me nerves an' how i get

Depressed an' i need to take these cos they

Make me better...



Linda

I get depressed but i don't take those. You

Don't need those, mickey



Mickey

Leave me alone, will y'? I can't cope with this.

I'm not well. The doctor said, didn't he, i'm not

Well... I can't do things. Just leave me alone linda.



Mrs johnstone

With grace for good behaviour

He got out before his time

The family and the neighbours told him

He was lookin' fine.

But he's feelin' fifteen years older

And his speech is rather slow

And his neighbours said

You'd think he was dead

Like marilyn monroe

No cause for dancing

No more dancing...



Mickey

Where's me tablets gone, linda?



Linda

Mickey you promised.



Mickey

I know i promised but i can't do without them.



Linda

Look. We've... We've managed to sort ourselves

This far but what's the use if



Mickey

Have we sorted ourselves out? Do you think i'm

Really stupid?



Linda

What?



Mickey

You sorted it out. You an' councillor eddie lyons.

Now give me tablets...i need them.



Linda

An' what about what i need? I need you.

I love you.
