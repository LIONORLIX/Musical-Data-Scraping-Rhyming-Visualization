Easy Terms


Mrs johnstone

Only mine until

The time comes round

To pay the bill.

Then i'm afraid.

What can't be paid

Must be returned.

You never, ever learn,

That nothing's yours,

On easy terms.



Only for a time,

I must not learn,

To call you mine.



Familiarise

That face, those eyes

Make future plans

That cannot be confirmed

On borrowed time,

On easy terms.



Living on the never never,

Constant as the changing weather,

Never sure

Who's at the door

Or the price i'll have to pay

Should we meet again

I will not recognise your name.

You can be sure

What's gone before

Will be concealed.

Your friends will never learn

That once we were

On easy terms.



Living on the never never,

Constant as the changing weather,

Never sure

Who's at the door

Or the price i'll have to pay...



Mrs lyons

They're born, you didn't notify me.



Mrs johnstone

Couldn't i keep them for a few more days,

They're a pair, they go together.



Mrs lyons

My husband is due back tomorrow, mrs. Johnstone.

I must have my baby we made an agreement,

A bargain. You swore on the bible.



Mrs johnstone

You'd better see which one you want



Mrs lyons

I'll take...



Mrs johnstone

No. Don't tell me which one. Just take him,

Justtake him



Living on the never never,

Constant as the changing weather,

Never sure

Who's at the door

Or the price i'll have to pay,

Should we meet again...
