Summer Sequence


Narrator

There's a few bob in your pocket

And you've got good friends,

And it seems that summer's never coming to an end

Young, free and innocent, you haven't got a care,

Apart from decidin' on the clothes you're gonna wear.

The street's turned into paradise,

The radio's singing dreams

You're innocent, immortal, you're just fifteen.

And who'd dare tell the lambs in spring

What fate the later seasons bring

Who'd tell the girl in the middle of the pair

The price she'll have to pay for just being there.



But leave them alone, let them go and play

They care not for what's at the end of the day

For what is to come, for what might have been

Life has no ending when you're sweet sixteen

And your friends are with you to talk away the night

Or until mrs wong switches off the chippy light

Then there's always the corner

And the street lamp's glare

An' another hour to spend, with your friends, with her,

To share your last cigarette and your secret dream

At the midnight hour...



... At seventeen



It's just another ferry boat, a trip to the beach

But everything's possible,

The world's within your reach

An' you don't even notice the broken bottles in the sand

The oil in the water and you can't understand

How living could be anything other than a dream

When you're young, free and innocent...



... And just eighteen.



And only if the three of them could stay like that forever,

And only if we could predict no changes in the weather

And only if we didn't live in life, as well as dreams

And only if we could stop and be forever,

Just eighteen.
