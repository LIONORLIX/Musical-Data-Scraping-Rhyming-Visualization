Light Romance/Madman


Narrator

There's a girl inside the woman

Who's waiting to get free

She's washed a million dishes

She's always making tea



They think she's just a mother

With nothing left inside

Who swapped her dreams for drudgery

The day she was a bride

But the dreams were not forgotten

Just wrapped, and packed away

In the hope that she could take them out

And dust them off one day



Linda

Hello. Could i talk to councillor lyons, please?



Narrator

There's a girl inside the woman

And the mother she became

And half-remembered song comes to her lips again



Linda

Eddie, could i talk to you? Yeh, i remember.



Narrator

The girl would sing the melody

But the woman stands in doubt

And wonders what the price would be

For letting the young girl out



Mrs johnstone

It's just a light romance

It's nothing cruel

They had no plans

How it came

Who can explain?

They just said "hello"

And foolishly gazed

They should have gone

Their separate ways



It's just the same old song

Nothing cruel, nothing wrong

It's just two fools

Who know the rules

But break them all

And grasp at half a chance

To play their part

In a light romance



Living on the never never,

Constant as the changing weather,

Never sure

Who's as the door,

Or the price

You're gonna have to pay



Mrs johnstone

It's just a secret glance

Across a room

A touch of hands

That part too soon

That same old tune

That always plays

And lets them dance as friends

Then stand apart

As the music ends



Loving on the never never

Constant as the changing weather

Never sure

Who's at the door

Or the price you're gonna have to pay

Mickey...



Narrator

There's man gone mad in the town tonight

He's gonna shoot somebody down

There's a man gone mad. Lost his mind tonight

There's a mad man, there's a mad man

There's a mad man running round and round



Now you know the devils got your number

He's runnin' right beside you

He's screamin' deep inside you

Ano someone said he's callin' your number



There's a mad man

There's a mad man

There's a mad man



Mrs johnstone

Linda. Linda.



Linda

Mam mam... What's...



Mrs johnstone

He's... Mickey... Mickey's got a gun...



Linda

Mickey?... Eddie?.. The town hall...



Mrs johnstone

What?



Linda

Narrator

There's a mad man running round and round

You now the devil's got your number

You know he's right beside you

He's screamin' deep inside you

And someone said he's callin' your number
