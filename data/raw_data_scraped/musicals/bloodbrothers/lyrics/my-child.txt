My Child


Mrs lyons

Hello, mrs j. How are you?

Mrs j.? Anything wrong?



Mrs johnstone

I had it all worked out.

With one more baby we could have managed.

But not with two, the welfare have already been on to me.



Mrs lyons

Twins? You're expecting twins?



Narrator

How quickly an idea, planted, can

Take root and grow into a plan.

The thought conceived in this very room

Grew as surely as a seed, in a mother's womb



Mrs lyons

Give one of them to me.

Please, mrs johnstone. Please.



Mrs johnstone

Are y'.... Are y' that desperate to have a baby?



Mrs lyons

Each day i look out from this window

I see him with his friends, i hear him call,

I rush down but as i fold my arms around him

He's gone. Was he ever there at all?



I've dreamed of all the places i would take him

The games we'd play the stories i would tell

The jokes we'd share, the clothing i would make him

I reach out. But as i do, he fades away.



Mrs johnstone

If my child was raised i a palace like this one

He wouldn't have to worry where

His next meal was comin' from



His clothing would be

Supplied by george henry lee



Mrs lyons

He'd have all his own toys

And a garden to play in



Mrs johnstone

He could make too much noise

Without the neighbours complainin'



Mrs lyons

Silver trays to take meals on



Mrs johnstone

A bike with both wheels on?



Mrs lyons

And he'd sleep every night

In a bed of his own



Mrs johnstone

He wouldn't get into fights

He'd leave matches alone

And you'd never find him

Effin' and blindin'

And when he grew up

He could never be told

To stand and queue up

For hours on end at the dole

He'd grow up to be



Mrs lyons / mrs johnstone

A credit to me



Mrs johnstone

To you?



Mrs lyons

Yes.



Mrs johnstone

I would still be able to see him every day,

Wouldn't i?



Mrs lyons

Of course



Mrs johnstone

An'.... An' you would look after him,

Wouldn't y'?



Mrs lyons

I'd keep him warm in the winter

And cool when it shines

I'd pull out his splinters

Without making him cry

I'd always be there

If his dream became a nightmare



Mrs johnstone & mrs lyons

My child

My child

My child



Mrs lyons

Mrs j. We must make this a binding agreement.



Narrator

In the name of jesus, the thing was done,

Now there's no going back, for anyone,

It's too late now for feeling torn

There's a pact been sealed,

There's a deal been born.
