We both defer the final bow

Cause she's the bigger star

Right now

No monkeys nooo monkeys



SO strap me in a harness

and hoist me up to the sky

in all the big shows lately

all the leading ladies have to fly

and hanging from the rafters

ill dangle like a blimp

pump up my volume

as i kill my flying chimp

and suddenly im defying sublty

with death defying lack of subtlty

ill capture world renound



ill blow the gershwin

up because

i am the loudest witch in oz

and no one's gonna turn

my volume down

Ohohhhhhh Oh!



Wicked!
