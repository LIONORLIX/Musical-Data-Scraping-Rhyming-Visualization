(MRS WORMWOOD)



Somewhere along the way, my dear

You've made an awful error.

You oughtn't blame yourself now

Come along.



You seem to think that people

Like people, what are clever.

It's very quaint, it's very sweet

But wrong!



People don't like smarty pants

What go round claiming

That they know stuff

We don't know.



Now, here's a tip.

What you know matters less

Than the volume with which

What you don't know's expressed!



Content, has never been less important.

So you have got to be ...



(MRS WORMWOOD and (ENSEMBLE))



Loud!

(Loud, loud, loud)



Girl, you've got to learn to stand out

And stick out from the crowd!

(Crowd, crowd, crowd)



A little less flat!

(Flat!)

A lot more heel!

(Heel!)

A little less fact!

(Fact!)

A lot more feel!

(Feel!)

A little less brains!

(Brains!)

A lot more hair!

(Hair!)

A little less head!

(Head!)

A lot more derriere!

(Derriere!)



(MRS WORMWOOD)



No-one's going to tell you when to shake your tush well.

You've got a light, don't hide it under a bushel!

Oh, no-one's going to listen if you don't stand out!

No-one's going to listen if you don't shout out!



(MRS WORMWOOD and RUDOLPHO)



No-one's going to care if you don't care!

So go and put some highlights in your hair!

'Cause you've gotta highlight what you've got!

Even if, what you've got is not a lot!



(MRS WORMWOOD and (CHORUS))



You've gotta be loud!

(Loud, loud, loud)



You've gotta give yourself a mission to shine.

To stand out from the crowd!

(Crowd, crowd, crowd)



(MRS WORMWOOD)



A little less bzz!

A lot more zing!

A little less pshh!

A lot more schwang!

A little less dressing like your Mum!

A little more bum-ba-bum-bum ba-da-bum



(Spoken)



Oh, I look nice!

You Don't!



(Sung)



No-one's going to tell you when to wiggle your bum-ba!



(RUDOLPHO)



No-one's going to love you if you don't know the rhumba!



(MRS WORMWOOD)



Everyone loves a little something exotic!



(RUDOLPHO)



But learning a language is over the top it,



(MRS WORMOOD)



Doesn't really matter if you don't know, know't!



(RUDOLPHO)



As long as you don't know it with a bitter clout!



(BOTH)



The less you have to sell, the harder you sell it!

The less you have to say, the louder you yell it!

The dumber the act, the bigger the confession!

The less you have to show, the larger you dress it!



You gotta get up!

You gotta get up and be



(MRS WORMWOOD and (CHORUS))



Loud!

(Loud, loud, loud)



You've gotta give yourself a mission to shine.

To stand out from the crowd!

(Crowd, crowd, crowd)



(MRS WORMWOOD)



A little less

A lot more

A little less

A lot more



No-one's gonna tell you when to, oh oh oh!

No one's gonna show you when to, ah, ah, ah!

If you want a little bit of mm, mm, mm

You can't sit around going la, la, la!



No one's gonna care if you don't care,

So go and put some highlights in your hair!

'Cause you've got to highlight what you've got.

And what do you got?



(MRS WORMWOOD and (CHORUS))



You gotta be loud!

(Loud, loud, loud)



You've gotta give yourself a mission to shine.

To stand out from the crowd!

(Crowd, crowd, crowd)



(MRS WORMWOOD - Spoken)



You so need a makeover!



You gotta be loud, loud, loud, loud, loud, loud, loud!



(RUDOLPHO)



5 - 6 - 7- 8!



(MRS WORMWOOD)



Wooooooo!



(RUDOLPHO - Spoken)



Yeah!



(MRS WORMWOOD)



Brrrrrrrooooooo!



(RUDOLPHO - Spoken)



Nice!



(MRS WORMWOOD - Spoken)



Check out the footwork - Jennifer Littleton!



(RUDOLPHO - Spoken)



I am the salsa of samba, baby! Woo! Yeah!



(MRS WORMWOOD and (CHORUS))



You gotta be loud!

(Loud, loud, loud)



(Spoken)



You're gorgeous!



You've gotta give yourself a mission to shine.

To stand out from the crowd!

(Crowd, crowd, crowd)



(MRS WORMWOOD - Spoken)



Are you listening?



(Sung)



You've got to be loud, loud, loud

Oooh!



Stand out from the crowd, crowd, crowd, crowd!



Loud, loud, loud, loud, loud, loud, loud, loud, loud, loud, loud, loud!



Ohhh, you gotta be Loud!
