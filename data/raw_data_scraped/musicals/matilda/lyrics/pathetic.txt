Pathetic


(MISS HONEY)



Knock on the door, Jenny.

Just knock on the door.

Don't be pathetic!



Knock on the door, Jenny.

There's nothing to fear.

You're being pathetic!

It's just a door, you've seen one before.

Just knock on the door!



Look at you trying to hide, silly.

Standing outside the Principal's Office.

Like a little girl!

It's just ... pathetic!

Ohhh!



Look at you hesitating, hands shaking!

You should be embarrassed!

You're not a little girl.

It's just pathetic.



Knock on the door, Jenny.

What are you waiting for?

Just knock on the door!



(SUNG IN A SPEECH-LIKE STYLE)



Perhaps I will wait.

She's probably having a meeting or something.

And won't want to be interrupted.

If anything, caution in these situations is sensible.

One should avoid confrontation when possible.

I'll come back later then!



(SUNG)



But this little girl

This miracle



Knock on the door, Jenny.

Just knock on the door.

Don't be pathetic!



(Knocking is heard)



(MISS TRUNCHBALL - Spoken)



Enter!
