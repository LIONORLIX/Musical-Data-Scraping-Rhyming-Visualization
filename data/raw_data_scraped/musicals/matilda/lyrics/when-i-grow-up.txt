When I Grow up


BRUCE:

When I grow up

I will be tall enough to reach the branches

That I need to reach to climb the trees

You get to climb when you're grown up.



BRUCE + TOMMY:

And when I grow up

I will be smart enough to answer all

The questions that you need to know

The answers to before you're grown up



AMANDA + ERIC:

And when I grow up

I will eat sweets every day

On the way to work and I

Will go to bed late every night!



BRUCE, TOMMY, AMANDA, + ERIC:

And I will wake up

When the sun comes up and I

Will watch cartoons until my eyes go square



ALL CHILDREN EXCEPT MATILDA:

And I won't care 'cause i'll be all grown up!

When I grow up!



When I grow up, when I grow up, when I grow up,

I will be strong enough to carry all

The heavy things you have to haul

Around with you when you're a grown-up!



ADULTS AND CHILDREN:

And when I grow up, when I grow up

I will be brave enough to fight the creatures

That you have to fight beneath the bed

Each night to be a grown-up!



And when I grow up

I will have treats every day.

And i'll play with things that mum pretends

That mum's don't think are fun.

And I will wake up

When the sun comes up and I

Will spend all day just lying in the sun

But I won't burn 'cause I'll be all grown-up!

When I grow up!



MISS HONEY:

And when I grow up,

I will be brave enough to fight the creatures

That you have to fight beneath the bed

Each night to be a grown-up,

When I grow up...



MATILDA:

Just because you find that life's not fair, it

Doesn't mean that you just have to grin and bear it,

If you always take it on the chin and wear it

Nothing will change!



MISS HONEY:

When I grow up....



MATILDA:

Just because I find myself in this story,

It doesn't mean that everything is written for me.

If I think the ending is fixed already,

I might as well be saying

I think that it's ok!

And that's not right!
