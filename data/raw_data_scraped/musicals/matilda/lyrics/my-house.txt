My House


(MISS HONEY)



This roof keeps me dry when the rain falls.

This door helps to keep the cold at bay.

On this floor I can stand on my own two feet.



On this chair I can write my lessons.

On this pillow I can dream my nights away.

And this table, as you can see, well, it's perfect for tea.



It isn't much but it is enough for me.

It isn't much but it is enough...



On these walls I hang wonderful pictures.

Through this window I can watch the seasons change.

By this lamp I can read, and I, I am set free!



And when it's cold outside I feel no fear!

Even in the winter storms, I am warmed by a small but stubborn fire.

And there is no-where I would rather be.



It isn't much but it is enough for me.

It isn't much but it is enough for me.



For this is my house!

This is my house!

It isn't much but it is enough for me.



This is my house!

This is my house!

It isn't much but it is enough.



(MISS HONEY and (MATILDA and the ESCAPOLOGIST))



(Don't cry ...)

And when it's cold and bleak



(Please don't cry, I'm here! ... )

I feel no fear!



Even in the fiercest storms!

(Please don't cry ...)



I am warmed

(Let me wipe away your tears!)

by a small but stubborn fire!



(MISS HONEY and (the ESCAPOLOGIST))



(Forgive me)

Even when outside it's freezing

(I didn't want to desert you)

I don't pay much heed.



(I know that I hurt you)

I know that everything I need is in here.



It isn't much but it is enough for me.

It isn't much but it is enough for me.
