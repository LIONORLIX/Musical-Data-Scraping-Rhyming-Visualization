Naughty


(MATILDA)



Jack and Jill, went up the hill

To fetch a pail of water, so they say

Their subsequent fall was inevitable

They never stood a chance, they were written that way

Innocent victims of their story!



Like Romeo and Juliet

T' was written in the stars before they even met

That love and fate, and a touch of stupidity

Would rob them of their hope of living happily

The endings are often a little bit gory

I wonder why they didn't just change their story?

We're told we have to do as we're told but surely

Sometimes you have to be a little bit naughty.



Just because you find that life's not fair it

Doesn't mean that you just have to grin and bear it

If you always take it on the chin and wear it

Nothing will change.



Even if you're little, you can do a lot, you

Mustn't let a little thing like, 'little' stop you

If you sit around and let them get on top, you

Might as well be saying

You think that it's ok

And that's not right!

And if it's not right!

You have to put it right!



(speaking part)



Cinderella, in the cellar

Didn't have to do much as far as I can tell

Her Godmother, was two thirds fairy

Suddenly her lot was a lot less scary

But what if you haven't got a fairy to fix it?

Sometimes you have to make a little bit of mischief.



Just because you find that life's not fair it

Doesn't mean that you just have to grin and bear it

If you always take it on the chin and wear it

Nothing will change.



Even if you're little, you can do a lot, you

Mustn't let a little thing like, 'little' stop you

If you sit around and let them get on top, you

Might as well be saying

You think that it's ok

And that's not right!

And if it's not right!

You have to put it right!



(Spoken)



Platinum blonde hair dye, extra strong.

Keep out of reach of children

Hmmm ....



Oil of violet hair tonic, for men

Yep!



(Sung)



In the slip of a bolt, there's a tiny revolt.

The seeds of a war in the creak of a floorboard.

A storm can begin, with the flap of a wing.

The tiniest mite packs the mightiest sting!

Every day, starts with the tick of a clock.

All escapes, starts with the click of a lock!

If you're stuck in your story and want to get out

You don't have to cry, you don't have to shout!



'Cause if you're little you can do a lot, you

Mustn't let a little thing like, 'little' stop you

If you sit around and let them get on top, you

Won't change a thing!



Just because you find that life's not fair, it

Doesn't mean that you just have to grin and bear it!

If you always take it on the chin and wear it

You might as well be saying

You think that it's ok

And that's not right!

And if it's not right!

You have to put it right!



But nobody else it gonna put it right for me!

Nobody but me is going to change my story!

Sometimes you have to be a little bit naughty!
