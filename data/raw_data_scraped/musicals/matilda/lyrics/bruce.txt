I can see that a slice

Or even two, Bruce,

Might've been nice

But even you, Bruce,

Have to admit

Between you and it

There's not a lot of difference in size.



He can't! He can! Bruce!

He surely can't! He surely can't!

you are the man, Bruce!

he might explode! He's quite elastic.

hes going to blow! Make him stop!

hes fantastic! Look at hike go!

I can't watch!



I think in effect

This must confirm, Bruce,

What we all suspected -

You have a worm, Bruce,

Or maybe your largeness

Is a bit like the Tardis:

Considerably roomier inside.



He can't! He can! Bruce!

He surely can't! He surely can't!

You are the man, Bruce!

B-R-O-O-C-E



Bruce,

The time has come to put that tumbly tum to use.

You produce, Bruce,

Fantastically enthusiastic gastric juice! Oh ...

Eat it up! Lick it up! Suck it up!

Whatever you do, don't chuck it up and muck it up!

Come on Bruce, be our hero,

Cover yourself in Chocolate Glory!



Bruce!

You'll never again be subject to abuse

For your immense caboose,

She'll call a truce, Bruce

With every swallow you are

Tightening the noose.

We never thought it was possible

But here it is coming true:

We can have our cake and eat it too.



The time has come to put that tumbly tum to use,

No excuse, Bruce,

Let out your belt, I think you'll want your trousers loose.

Ohhh stuff it in!

You're almost finished!

You'll fit it in!

Whatever you do just don't give in!

Don't let her win!

Come on Bruce, be our hero,

Cover your self in chocolate glory ...



MATILDA

Go on Bruce. Do it!



KIDS

ohhhhhhh Bruce!

You'll never again be subject to abuse

For your immense carboose,

She'll call a truce, Bruce.

Just one more bite and you'll've

Completely cooked her goose.

We never thought it was possible

But here it is coming true:

We can have our cake and eat it ...

ahh ahh ahh ahh ...



MISS HONEY

Go on Brucey!
