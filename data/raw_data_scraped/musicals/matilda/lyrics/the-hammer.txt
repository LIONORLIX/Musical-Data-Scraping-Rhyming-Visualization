The Hammer


Look at these trophies

See how my trophies gleam

In the sunlight, see how they shine



What do you think it

took to become English

Hammer-throwing champion

Nineteen-sixty-nine?



Do you think in that moment

When my big moment came

That I treated the rules

With casual disdain



Well, LIKE HELL!



As I stepped up to the circle

did I change my plan? Hmm... what?

As I chalked up my palms

did I wave my hands? I DID NOT!



As I started my spin

did I look at the view?

Did I drift off and dream

for a minute or two?



Do you think I faltered or amended my rotation?

Do you think I altered my intended elevation?

As the hammer took off did I change my grunt

From the grunt I had practiced for many a month?



Not a jot, not a dot did I stray from the plot

Not a detail of my throw was adjusted or forgotten

Not even when the hammer left my hands

And sailed up, up above the stands



Did I let myself go?

No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no...



No.



If you want to throw the hammer for your country,

You have to stay inside the circle all the time,

And if you want to make the team,

You dont need happiness or self-esteem,

You just need to keep your feet inside the line.



Sing, children 2, 3, 4!

If you want to throw the hammer for your country,

Habinot est magitem.

You have to stay inside the circle all the time.

Circular! Magitem! Magitem!

And if you want to teach success,

(Aaah)

You dont use sympathy or tenderness.

Tenderness

You have to force the little squits to toe the line!



Sing, Jenny 2, 3, 4!

If you want to throw the hammer for your country,

Regotem Regotem varia magitem

You have to stay inside the circle all the time.

Tempero es te iste is.

Apply just one simple rule -

To hammer-throwing, life, and school -

Lifes a ball, so learn to throw it.

Find the bally line, and toe it,

And always keep your feet inside the line.

Now get out!
