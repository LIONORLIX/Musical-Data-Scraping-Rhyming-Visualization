Bess, You Is My Woman


Porgy:

Bess, you is my woman now, you is, you is!

An' you mus' laugh an' sing an' dance for two instead of one.

Want no wrinkle on yo' brow,

Nohow,

Because de sorrow of de past is all done done

Oh, Bess, my Bess!



Bess:

Porgy, I's yo' woman now,

I is, I is!

An' I ain't never goin' nowhere 'less you shares de fun.

Dere's no wrinkle on my brow,

Nohow,

But I ain't goin'! You hear me sayin',

If you ain' goin', wid you I'm stayin'!



Porgy, I's yo' woman now!

I's yours forever -

Mornin' time an' evenin' time an'

summer time an' winter time.



Porgy:

summer time an' winter time.

Bess, you got yo' man.



Bess, you is my woman now and forever.

Dis life is jes' begun,

Bess, we two is one

Now an' forever.

Oh, bess, don't min' dose women.

You got yo' Porgy.

I knows you means it,

I seen it in yo' eyes, Bess.

We'll go swingin'

Through de years a-singin'.



Bess:

Mornin' time an' evenin' time an' summer time an' winter time.



Porgy:

Mornin' time an' evenin' time an' summer time an' winter time.
