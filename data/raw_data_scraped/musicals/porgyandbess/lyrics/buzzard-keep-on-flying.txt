Buzzard Keep on Flying


Boss, that bird mean trouble.

Once the buzzard fold his wing

And light over your house,

All your happiness done dead.

Buzzard keep on flying over, take along your shadow.

Ain`t nobody dead this morning

Livin`s just begun.

Two is strong where one is feeble;

Man and woman living, working,

Sharning grief and sharning laughter,

And love like August sun.

Trouble, is that you over yonder

Looking lean and hungry?

Don`t you let that buzzard keep you

Hanging round my door.

Ain`t you heard the news this morning?

Step out, brother, hit the gravel.

Porgy who you used to feed on,

Don`t live here no more.

Ha, ha, ha! Buzzard, on you way!

Ole age, what is you anyhow,

Nothing but being lonely.

Pack your things and fly from here,

Carry grief and pain.

There`s two folks living in the shelter

Eating, sleeping, singing, praying.

Ain`t no such thing as loneliness.

And Porgy`s young again.

Buzzard, keep on flying,

Porgy`s young again.
