Oh, I Can't Sit Down


I can't sit down

Oh I can't sit down

I gotta keep a goin' like the flowin' of a song

Oh I can't sit down

I guess I'll take my honey an' her sunny smile along



Today I am gay an' I'm free

Oh just a bubblin,' nothin' troubblin' me

Oh I can't sit down

I can't sit down



Happy feelin' in my bones astealin',

No concealin' det is picnic day!

Yeah I'm feelin' happy,

I'm feelin' happy, so happy, det is picnic day!

Sure is dandy, got de likker handy, Me an' Mandy

Sure I'm feelin' happy, I'm feelin' happy, so happy

We are on de way because it's picnic day!



Oh I can't sit down

I gotta keep a jumpin' like de thumpin' of a drum

Oh I can't sit down

I'm full of all commotion like an ocean full of rhum!



Today I am gay an' I'm free

Oh just a bubblin' nothin' troubblin' me

Oh I'm goin' to town

I can't sit down

I can't sit down



Oh baby I can't sit down

Oh baby I can't sit down

Gotta keep agoin'

Keep agoin' like a song'
