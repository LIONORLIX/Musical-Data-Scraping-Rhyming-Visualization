A Red-Headed Woman


Crown:

A red-headed woman makes a cho-choo jump its track.

A red-headed woman she can make it jump right back.

Oh, she`s just nature`s child.

She`s got something that drives men wild.

A red-headed woman`s gonna take you wether you`re

White, yellow or black.

But show me her the red-head that can make a fool of me!

Oh, she aren`t existing on the land or on the sea.

Oh, you can knock me down

If they don`t fall for Brother Crown.

Oh, show me the red-head that can make a fool of me.



All:

Lawd, Lawd, save us, don`t listen to that Crown, Lawd,

Jesus, oh, pay no mind to that Crown

Oh, Lawd, strike him down, strike him down.

Oh, Lawd, don`t listen to that Crown.



Crown:

Oh, show me the red-head that can make a fool of me,

Oh, she aren`t existing on the land or on the sea.

Oh, you can knock me down

If they don`t fall for Brother Crown.

Oh, show me the red-head that can make a fool of,

I said a fool out of me!
