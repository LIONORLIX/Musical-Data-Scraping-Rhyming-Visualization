Ralph and Me


JANEY

Ralph and me are gettin' married.

AGGIE

Well, that's very nice, Jane.

JANEY

It's all decided.

Ralph and me, we got this friend who's gettin' married,

And they're movin' to her folks' in California.

AGGIE

That's nice.

JANEY

They're gettin' married right away.

She's already four months gone.

They can' wait another day.

AGGIE

Who?

JANEY

Kelly.  From work.  You don't know her.

So they're flyin' out to California.

AGGIE

This friend.

JANEY

Right.

But they've got this car,

And they need to get it out there soon.

AGGIE

Who?

JANEY

And Ralph and me figure

We can drive it out for them,

Make the trip a honeymoon.

AGGIE

So?

JANEY

So we have to do it quick:

Drive cross-country, get a tan by a motel swimming pool,

And fly back here in time for Ralph to teach summer school.

AGGIE

Tom, your daughter's getting married.

TOM

Do I look deaf?  Janey, that's very nice.

JANEY

But there won't be any fuss.

I really want to make that clear.

Just immediate family and us

And Alice as my matron of honor,

Since I was hers last year.

We'll meet at City Hall, Thursday, ten a.m.

We'll get married by the clerk.

It won't take any time at all.

AGGIE

Not Father Murphy?

JANEY

There's no time for a church wedding, Ma.

We gotta get the car out to them,

And I'm only takin' three weeks off from work.

But we'll go talk to Father Murphy.  I promise.  And, we'll have to invite his folks for dinner.

AGGIE

Father Murphy's?

JANEY

Ralph's.  Mr. and Mrs. Halloran.

TOM

Can I get the salt?

JANEY

I know it's kind of short notice but how about tonight?

AGGIE

Well, I'm going to market anyway.

JANEY

That alright with you, Pa?

TOM

That's fine, Janey.

JANEY

I'll tell Ralph to bring his folks by around seven.  Nothing fancy.

A simple family meal-I'll pick up some wine.

And I mean it about the wedding...

We don't want a big ordeal.

The civil ceremony will do fine.

Then Ralph and me,

The handsome groom and the blushing bride

Will be off on our little cross-country ride.
