Poor Little Hollywood Star


BELLE

Once you were an ordinary average little girl

From Illinois.

Once it was an ordinary average little life,

And what a joy.

Sudden success

Caught you, I guess,

High on its glittering bough.

Blithe and merry ordinary average little girl,

Where are you now?



Carefully dressed, carefully coached,

Diamond-braceleted, emerald-broached,

Just to be loved from afar,

Poor little Hollywood star.

One of the rare, one of the great,

Everyone's idol, but nobody's mate,

Poor little fairytale queen,

How do you fill the void

Under that celluloid sheen?

Smile for your fans, live for your art,

What if nobody gives that for your heart?

This is the very last stop,

Where can you go from the top?

So never relax, never give in,

Hold in those longings and stick out that chin.

Loved and adored as you are,

Your melancholy would

Seem just a trifle bizarre

In this jolly wood.

Poor little, shiny, secure little Hollywood star.
