PRINCE

Goodbye.



PEOPLE

Goodbye.



PRINCE

Goodbye.



YULNICK

We hate to see you die.



PRINCE

Well, anyway, goodbye.



PEOPLE

Goodbye.



PRINCE

Goodbye.



YULNICK

You couldn't put it off?



PRINCE

I'd love to put it off, but then

We'd only have to do this painful scene again,

So let's just say goodbye.

So goodbye, Yulnick, goodbye, Yisha,

Goodbye, Sam, I'm sure gonna miss ya,

Goodbye, Melnick, goodbye, Myron,

Pardon my expirin'.

Goodbye, country, it's been fun,

You know I hate to rule and run,

But I must get some dying done,

So everyone,

Goodbye!

Ach, don't cry.

Someday we'll say hello.



TENOR

We hate to see you blow.



PRINCE

I'll meet you in the sweetest land I know.



PEOPLE

We hope it isn't soon.



PRINCE

It's gonna be so wunderbar.



PEOPLE

So full of that funiculi, funicula.



PRINCE

It almost pays to go.

So sing, Natasha, you too, Bradley,

Not you, Sol, you sing very badly.

Dance, Matilda, till I holler

For the funeral poller.

Down with rotten rhetoric!

I think I'm getting very sick,

So sing or dance or do a trick,

But quick,

I gotta die!



PEOPLE

Hey!



(Dance.)



PEOPLE

So goodnight, sweet prince, goodbye, highness,

Though you've been a definite minus,

We forgive your royal fumbles.



PRINCE

That's the way the kingdom crumbles.



PEOPLE

So long.



PRINCE

So long.



PEOPLE

Ta-ta.



PRINCE

Ta-ta.



ALL

Goodbye!
