Little Me


OLD BELLE

There was I,

Schnitzie dead and gone,

All alone and friendless,

What was I to do?



YOUNG BELLE

What to do? What do do?

Here am I,

How can I go on,

Chasing down these endless

Cul-de-sacs and hallways?

Who would see me through?



OLD BELLE

Well, I ask of you...



OLD BELLE & YOUNG BELLE

Who would see me through

As always?



OLD BELLE & YOUNG BELLE (alternating)

Who to tell my troubles to?

Lend a sympathetic ear?

Who to cheer me when I'm blue?

Wipe away each little tear?

When there's no one left,

I am not bereft,

There is always little me.

(Old reliable.)

When a year goes down the drain,

And I haven't made a cent,

When I fall in love in vain,

Or I give it up for Lent,

Friends can fly the coop,

Leave me in the soup,

Who'd come through with lentils?

And to get to fundamentals:

When the chips are really down,

Who would not be out of town?

(Or a blabbermouth?)

Who do I esteem most?

Who do I adore most?

Who deserves the cream most?

Who built up the candy store most?

Who comes first and foremost?

Obviously,

(When you add it all up)

Ever-lovin' little me.



Rise or fall,

Loyal friend,

Through it all

To the end.



When it comes to parlez-vous,

Who could parlez-vous a few?

(With the best of 'em?)

Who'll retrieve that bounty?

Who'll pursue that quarry?

Like a Northwest Mountie,

Only built like Mata Hari?

Who'll get Lochinvar e-

Ventually?

In a little black sheer

With a little bit here

And a little "mon cher"

And a little bit there?

(Just a little bit.)

Who will make you sorry,

Wait and see?

(Mrs. Eggleston.)

Yours sincerely, little,

I mean, merely little,

Yours sincerely, little me.
