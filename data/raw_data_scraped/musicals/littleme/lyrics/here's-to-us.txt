Here's To Us


BELLE

Here's to us, my darling, my dear,

Here's to us tonight.

Not for what might happen next year,

For it might not be nearly as bright.

But here's to us, for better or worse,

And for thanks to a merciful star,

Skies of blue, and muddling through,

And for me and for you as we are.

And here's to us for nothing at all

If there's nothing at all we can praise,

Just that we're together and here

For the rest of our beautiful days.

Here's to us forever and always.



BELLE & CHORUS

Here's to us, my darling, my dear,

Here's to us tonight.

Not for what might happen next year,

For it might not be nearly as bright.

But here's to us, for all that we have,

And the road that we've travelled so far,

Skies of blue, and muddling through,

And for me and for you as we are.

And here's to us for nothing at all

If there's nothing at all we can praise,

Just for spring, and wanting to sing,

And for feeling like flinging bouquets.

Here's to us forever and always.
