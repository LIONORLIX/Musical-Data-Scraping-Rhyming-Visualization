Boom, Boom


VAL

Poor Pierrot, I hear him yet

In pursuit of his Pierette,

With the same old urgent message to impart.

What it was, she never found out,

For the point was always drowned out

By the violent cannonading of his heart.

Boom-boom!

He'd say "Pierette..."

And clear his throat.

"Lest we forget..."

And here I quote:



If the girl... (boom-boom!)

And the boy... (boom-boom!)

And they get together and they both... (boom-boom!)

C'est la grande... (boom-boom!)

Et la grande... (boom-boom!)

That's the one... (boom-boom!) ...for me.

Oh, a stray... (boom-boom!)

Occasionally may

Prove a gay... (boom-boom!)

And carry you away.

But the prime... (boom-boom!)

That's sublime... (boom-boom!)

Won't be true,

Not if you

All the time... (boom-boom!)

What I mean is, ma cherie,

Save la grande... (boom-boom!) ...for me.



VAL & CHORUS

Oh, a stray... (boom-boom!)

Occasionally may

Prove a gay... (boom-boom!)

And carry you away.

But the dream... (boom-boom!)

That's supreme... (boom-boom!)

Is for two

People who

Like a team... (boom-boom!)

What I mean is, ma cherie,

Save la grande... (boom-boom!) ...for me.
