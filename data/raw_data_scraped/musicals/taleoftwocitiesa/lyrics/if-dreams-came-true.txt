If Dreams Came True


Carton

If dreams came true i might have been a better man.

If dreams came true you might have set me free.

But god is kind, for you he had a better plan

And saved you from the pain of loving me.

And even if i'd not surrendered long ago

All you can ever do for me you've done.

You've been the finest dream a man could ever know:

That this abandoned fight might have been won.

Old voices i had thought long since dead

Whisper of another life i might have led.

But daylight wakes dreams away.

Dreams that leave a sleeper where he lay.

And even if the dream were not impossible.

I know too well the ending would be sad.

For it takes more than wishes to make dreams come true.

A wish was all this dreamer ever had.

But there's a part of you i can love

Just like you your child sees good in everyone

When i look into her eyes there's no dissapproving glance.

Knowing her's an endless second chance.

If i could take that second chance...

If i could make my life anew...

If only dreams came true... What are you weeping for?

I am not worth the tears you waste

Not far from now i'll sink once more

And outward mock the heart that loves you chaste.

The low companions, low desires i scorn but yield to endlessly

Will render me less worth your tears than any wretch who roams the street

I won't forget you wept for me

If dreams came true i might have been a better man.

If dreams came true you might have set me free.

But god is kind, for you he has a better plan.

And maybe time will tell he has some plan for me

And maybe then i'll see my dreams come true.
