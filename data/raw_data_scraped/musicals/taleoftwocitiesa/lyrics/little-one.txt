Little One


Carton

Little one

Ease your heart

Close your eyes

And let dreams take you far

Far away from the storm

To a summer day, warm and fair

Hardly a care finds you, little one.



Defarge

Little one ease your heart

Close your eyes

And let dreams take you far far away

From the screams

And the smell of blood in the air

Hardly a care finds you little one



Jacques

Little one

Mind your way

Don't let people without hearts step on you

And toss you away. If you'll wait and you'll pray

Papa will save you and hide you away.

Little one

Heed my voice

Little one

Mind your way

Just you wait



Defarge

Just you wait.
