Let Her Be a Child


Carton

Now i lay me down to sleep

I pray the lord my soul to keep

If i should die before i wake

I pray the lord my soul to take

She mustn't know the sorrow

She mustn't know the tears

Tomorrow mustn't bring her

A future that she fears

How many now lay crying?

Their dreams will have to keep.

How many never have a chance?

Tonight, let this one sleep.

A child is filled with wonder.

Let this one's dreams be blessed.

Don't ever let her wonder

If god might love her less.

She mustn't know what we know

She mustn't be so wise.

There's time enough for her to see

Just let her be a child

For now.

She's still so small. She'll never understand

How people fail and lives break down

And don't turn out

The way you planned

For now save her the sorrow

For now save her the tears

Save grief for somewhere years away just not today; not here.

For now let her be lucky

For now look down in grace

Give her time to learn compassion

Give her time to learn forgiveness

Help me find the strength to give this gift to her

Only let her be a child

Let her be a child

Just let her be a child for now.
