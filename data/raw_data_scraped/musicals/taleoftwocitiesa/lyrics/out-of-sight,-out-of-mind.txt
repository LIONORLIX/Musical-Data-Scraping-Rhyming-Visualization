Out of Sight, Out of Mind


Madame Defarge

Out of sight, out of mind.

See the child of the street

Never give them a thought;

How they live where they sleep

Grind them into the ground

It's the kind thing to do

Death is welcome retreat from the sorrow they find

Out of sight, out of mind

But here, the pain is never out of sight.

The sick, the starved, the poor.

There is no room for us to turn away.

We can't just shut the door.

Out of sight, out of mind.

Where the strong never look.

If we don't come too near it's as if we're not here.

And there's nothing to fear.

But out of sight we have the room to plan

We watch them from afar.

They won't suspect

That soon we'll see a day

When they know who we are.

Let them stay unafraid.

Just for now keep them blind

Patience waits for a spark

Til the time that is right.

We'll remain in the dark...

Out of sight, out of mind

Out of sight, out of mind

Out of sight, out of mind
