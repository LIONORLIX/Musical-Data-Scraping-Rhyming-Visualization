The Bluff


Carton

My first card is an ace. I'm certain you'll agree.

Concerning the affairs of a well-known french marquis.

Seems before you were spy of the prison

You spent some time in his employ.

Dare i speak that foul name that they've cursed straight to hell?

Whose unfortunate nephew now sits in a cell.

Would they still let you live if they knew of your bond

With the damned unforgiveable marquis called st. Evremonde?



Barsad

That card's a nasty threat and very hard to beat.

I'd like to help you out,

And still remain discreet.

But i have such a sinking suspicion you're thinking of breaking him out.

Mr. Carton, i can't do a thing for your friend.

I'm afraid that the debt must be paid in the end.

No such thing as escape from the fate that he'll face.

I'd as soon take my chances and stay within france's good grace.

So play your ace!



Carton

I never suggested we would toy with notions of escape.

I never suggested we would interfere with darnay's fate...



Barsad

Then tell me what you're suggesting?



Carton

A favor's all that i'm requesting.

One meeting, one interview.

No tricks, no traps...



Barsad

No doubledeal?



Carton

The last thing i want to do is make him miss his final meal.



Barsad

Then tell me just what you're after?



Carton

If you'll come through for me

My dreams come true for me.

Barsad

You'll get his blessing!

His bedding!



Carton

We'll ask you to the wedding!



Barsad

I knew it all along

You're just the same as me



Carton

A low down dirty snake?



Barsad

No resourceful!



Carton

Now i see?



Both

We're two soul mates from hell doing well

For the thing that we sell fills a need.

And who else did the heavens expect to survive:

With the rest of the world barely staying alive?

Since dishonesty's always the best hand to play



Carton

Then i swear not to squeal



Barsad

And you'll see your darnay



Both

You and i have a deal

For we both know there's no honest way.
