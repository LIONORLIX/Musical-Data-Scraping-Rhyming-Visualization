No Honest Way


Barsad

Working hard's fine for some

Lacking intellect



Cruncher

Or dumb



Barsad

Slaving day and night's no way to lighten my load



Carton and cruncher

Don't tell me to work an honest job

When it's easier to cheat and rob



All

Let another law-abiding slob take the high road.



Barsad

There's no way you can thrive and keep honesty alive

Try to scale the moral peak and never backslide

Those with all the power in their hands

Get the law to bow to their demands

And the law abiding man just lands on his backside

And if you go to court tomorrow



All

He'll be on the stand.

A certain frenchman's up for treason put there by his hand!



Barsad

There's a marquis quite grand with a nephew he can't stand

So good hearted any heartless chap should hate

But with just a couple lies from me

He'll be framed just like the mona lee

And they'll take him out and swiftly de- capitate him



All

For with no honest way it's hard to keep from doing wrong.

And with no honest way he has no choice but go along!



Barsad

Look at him; like a tot. Should we wake him?



Men

Nah.



Barsad

Better not.

What's this pokin' from his pocket

What's this token that he's got?

Why's he loaded down with all this wealth?



All

He'd be happier with just his health...

There's just no honest way

There's just no honest way

There's just no decent,

Law-abiding, honest way
