The Tale


Madame Defarge

Wait! I denounce this man!

I and two more:

Ernest Defarge and dr. Manette.



Dr. Manette

I don't denounce this man

This is a lie...



Madame Defarge

It's here in your own words it's here

In black and white.

Words that you can't take back words even you cannot fight.

In the bastille, my husband found

This paper left in the wall written by you, dr. Manette:

This paper explains it all.

How as a doctor in the country,

Called on to aid a girl in need,

Beaten and raped and left to bleed -

Nothing the doctor could do would save her life,

Nor her young brother who fell defending her.

And the two noblemen who had done this crime,

Don't you remember exactly who they were?

How you went that night

To the evremondes

And you found a dreadful sight?

A young woman lay in a pool of blood.

It was clear to you she had put up quite a fight.

Her young brother lay a few feet away

With a sabre by his side.

He had tried in vain

To defend the girl

Armed with little more than pride.



Boy

Save my sister sir

She is badly hurt

Save my sister.

Leave me be.



Dr. Manette

She is gone my son

To a better place

She's at peace.

She's free.



Boy

She had married for love

When this man with his wealth

Saw her beauty and vowed he would have her himself.

But my sister was pure

And she wouldn't be used.

And her husband protected her

And he refused

You know the law

A peasant has no rights

The master owns your breath.

They took this man

They tied him to a cart

And drove him to his death.

With her man out of sight

These two came for their prize.

Took their turns like a game,

Didn't care what i'd find.

I was there but too late...

Out of sight, out of mind.



Dr. Manette

Be still my son.



Boy

That's not the end, m'suier.

I have another sister -

Younger sister

They will never find.

I've hidden her away,

Far, far away from here.

Far away from all their kind.



Dr. Manette

Can i find this girl?

Can i help this girl?



Boy

No, m'siuer.

God must help her now.



Marquis

Is he dead?



Dr. Manette

No. Not yet.



Marquis

We need to know

You'll never breathe a word

Of what you've seen

Of anything you've heard.

You must accept the fee we wish to pay.

How else can we be certain -

How else can we be sure you will obey?



Dr. Manette

I do not want your money, sir



Marquis

But you must m'siuer...



Dr. Manette

I will not take your money, sir.



Marquis

But you don't understand.



Dr. Manette

How can you stand there his blood on my hands?

How can you tell me that i should forget?

I will not rest til the world understands

What you have done here this day.

This time you're going to pay.

I promise you gentlemen

This time it won't go away.



People

Taken away and sent to the bastille.

Seventeen years he spent in the bastille.

Seventeen years and where was the sister?

Seventeen years and where was the sister?



Madame Defarge

I am the sister that boy hid away.

That was my family the evremondes killed.

I've waited twenty-five years for this day.

Dr. Manette may forget.

Dr. Manette may forgive.

But this one survivor will never let evremonde live.

All those years in the dark.

All those years biding time.

This was hidden away til

The moment was right.

Til the time came to pay,

Out of sight,

Out of mind.
