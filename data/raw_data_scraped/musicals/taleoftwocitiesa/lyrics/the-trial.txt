The Trial


Attorney General

Your honourable lordship

The prisoner you see here

Must be of no earthly good or else he wouldn't be here!

While he was aboard ship

His traitorous mission

Was noticed by many through his shameless exhibition.



All

Thank god for law and order!



Jury

There is no greater liquidator in the land!

As men of business we prevail



Cruncher

Though they object to paying taxes to feed those who lax in jail.



Jury

We vote for practicality

And feel the proper place for criminals



Cruncher

Is dangling from a tree.



Gallery

This fella's a goner he'll never get let off



Cruncher

And they love to see it when they get to cut a head off.



Attorney General

I call mr. Barsad

A witness to treason

A man who is here for purely patriotic reason.



Women

He's the biggest cheat in town

Testifyin' for the crown

He'll be lyin' up and down



Gallery

Thank god for mr. Barsad.

Thank god he did his best withstood the test and gave it all he had.

A fine example to us all



Attorney General

Why if the english, like the romans honored men of public good



Gallery

He's have a statue twelve feet tall!



Stryver

As funds are tight this year it does appear he'll only get a bust

We trust that he will just make do



Barsad

On deck i was strolling

I noticed this frenchman

And he didn't seem like any ordinary henchman

He looked very honest

But i would discover

That he was a book where you must look inside the cover

He laid down his top coat

And out of his pocket

Came tumbling papers which have sent him to the docket

I thought i'd be helpful

I bent and retrieved them

And my eyes beheld such a sight

I thought the night deceived them



Attorney General

They were military lists



Barsad

Troop positions, strength and plans



Attorney General

You could not imagine how they were found in foreign hands



Barsad

I'm an ordinary man just a trusting type of guy



Ag/Barsad

But it seemed to him/me this man was the foulest kind of spy!



Jury we see no sense in lenience

We must dispatch the ones we catch without delay



Women

Offenders must not go scott free!



Jury on crimes both big and small

The axe must fall with uniformity women

Though crimes may vary by degree



All

It makes more sense to have one penalty for everything, you see,

That's true equality and who could disagree



Gallery

There isn't a loyal brit with half a wit

Who'd dare to disagree



All

With that!
