The Way It Ought to Be


Madame Defarge

From where i sit i see the way things are

The way they've always been

From here the heavens seem a little far

And this world full of sin

And with these hands i keep a memory

Of the ones who've done such wrong

Until the judgement comes and all of us are free

I knit a picture of the way it ought to be.



Ernest Defarge

You've always known this world is black and cold

And human life is cheap

You've always known most men are out for blood

And god is fast asleep

And you can stand there doing nothing

Hating everyone you see

Or you can fight to make a world where men are free

It's up to us to choose the way it ought to be



Madame Defarge

And you can stand there doing nothing hating everyone you see



Ernest Defarge

Or you can fight to make a world where men are free



Men

Until the judgement comes until this world is free



Madame Defarge

I knit a picture of the way it ought to be



Sydney Carton

If you ask me the world could use a shot

Of whiskey in its glass

I've earned the right to judge

I've learned a lot

Observing on my ass

This little bottle keeps mankind at bay

And far away from me

And when i'm blind with drink

I like the world i see

I even think the world's the way it ought to be
