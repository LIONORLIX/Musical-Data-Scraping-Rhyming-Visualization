The Promise


Dr. Manette

There's something in his face.

There's something i don't trust.

A memory i can't place from long ago.

And yet he's been so kind.

To doubt him is unjust.

For lucie's sake i'll put it from my mind...

I must.



Charles darnay

There are no words i know

To say the way i feel.

Words aren't enough to show you i'm sincere.

I've held this in as long as i could stand.



Dr. Manette

Because of me?



Charles darnay

Out of respect.



Dr. Manette

I understand.



Charles darnay

Lucie haunts my heart.

Haunts my thoughts, my prayers, my dreams, my nights, my days...



Dr. Manette

I feared this all along.



Charles darnay

She is everywhere that i turn...



Dr. Manette

What can i do?

I said i'd step aside one day.



Charles darnay

I love her

You share a special love

I swear by god above

I'd never take her love from you...

I only hope to share

In what's already there.

To love you both

And to be true.



Dr. Manette

Does lucie know?



Charles darnay

I've never told her so.

Without your blessing i've no hope...



Dr. Manette

It's up to me to choose

But either way i lose

If she should love him,

I must let her go.

It seems like yesterday

I stood there in his place

When someone meant the world to me...



Charles darnay

She is my world....



Dr. Manette

And someone gave the world to me.



Charles darnay

Give the world to me.



Dr. Manette

If lucie feels the same

You have my blessing sir.

Nothing means more to me than her.



Charles darnay you won't regret this trust.

And to repay your faith.

There is a secret you must learn...

Darnay is not my name.



Dr. Manette

Don't tell me anymore.



Charles darnay

But doctor please you ought to know.



Dr. Manette

If things should go your way

Tell me your wedding day.

For now, be silent,

Please just go.

At least i got her back

If for a little while.

At least i had a little while.
