Finale


Seamstress

You are not afraid.

All the others just pretend.

It's as if you would embrace

The very end.

You're an angel, sir.

You were sent to me by god.



Carton

And perhaps it's you that god has sent to me.



Seamstress

When i hold your hand; all my fears are in the past.

But when i let go do you promise they'll be fast?



Carton

Like a lightning flash

All your suffering will cease



Seamstress

Will i find you again?



Carton

There can be no farewells.

We will meet where the weary find peace







Carton

I can't recall a sky so clear

All the heavens seem an inch away and not unfriendly afterall



All

If life was never quite this sweet i can't recall



Carton

It is a far far better thing i do than i have ever done

It is a far better rest i go to than i have ever known



All

I can't recall
