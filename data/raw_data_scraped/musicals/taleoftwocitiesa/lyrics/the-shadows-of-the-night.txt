The Shadows of the Night


Lorry

I come to dig a man out.

I come to dig a man out.

Seventeen years; buried alive.

Buried alive. And i must dig him out.

I hope he cares

To be recalled to life



Manette

I cannot say, for sure.



Lorry

The shadows of the night

Are quickly closing in.

I can hear a muffled cry come from within.

And will he know i've come?

Will he want to be saved?

When i come dig someone out of the grave? Buried how long?



Manette

Almost eighteen years.



Lorry

You had abandoned any hope?



Manette

Long ago.



Lorry

You know that you're recalled to life?



Manette

They tell me so.



Lorry

I pray to god you care to live...



Manette

I just don't know...



Lorry

The night shadows.

The night shadows

Call to me.

Set him free

From the grave;

To the light.

Can i save him from

The night?

The night shadows

Call to me

I hope you care

To be recalled to life...



Manette

I cannot say.

I hope it's true. Will i one day

Thank god for you?
