Resurrection Man


Cruncher (sings)

If i were rid of wife and kid

My life would be my own.



Man#1

He'd never care if he were starving

If he'd none at home.



Cruncher

But selfish ain't my way.



Man #2

And odd-job jobs don't pay



Cruncher

What's wrong if i provide a little on the side

Ta dry a rainy day? When a poor brother dies god almighty surely cries to think that bloke will be of no constructive use right where he lies

But with nerves made of stone i approach the great unknown



Man #1

Turn down the covers of his bed

And resurrect him from the dead



Cruncher

When scientific guys

Need bodies for supplies



All

We'll bet a shiny shilling

Heaven's all too willing

Something should arise



Cruncher

Doctors need certain parts.



Man#1

Bleedin' kidneys...



Man#2

Bleedin' hearts...



Cruncher

And if they only need a small intestine



Man #1 and man #2

They've got jars the rest can rest in



Cruncher

When there's a cure

You'll be thanking me we're sure



All

As long as something gets you in the end me job's secure



Man #1

Say what you will



Man #2

He means no ill



Man #1

He loves the human race



Man #2

But what about some poor dead lout who's out a resting place?



Cruncher

I feel for them poor stiffs.



Man #2

Some people just don't care.



Cruncher

And for some measly tips



Man #1 and #2

He works to ease their boredom



Cruncher

Let 'em get some air



Man #2

Try and lie in a case



Man #1

Bugs and dirt all in your face



Man #1 and #2

A smell so rotten in the air just too monotonous to bear



Cruncher

What i do when i can is to serve my fellow man!

So if you wanna do your part...



Man #1

And if you ain't too faint o' heart!



Man #2

If you want salary increased...



Cruncher

And you deal well with the deceased...



All

A resurrectionist can let his conscience rest in peace!
