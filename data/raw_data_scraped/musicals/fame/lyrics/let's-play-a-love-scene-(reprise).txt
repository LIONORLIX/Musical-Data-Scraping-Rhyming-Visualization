Let's Play a Love Scene (Reprise)


You were the honest friend

I was the great pretender

I hid my feeling to the end



Now I want to say

What it means to me

How I could ever be the same

Without you



The way I know I really feel about you

The way I know I'll always feel about you

Why can't we

Why can't we

Why can't we try to play a love scene



We don't need the violins to play a love scene

Where we see how love begins

Find a way to start and learn to play the part

A perfect scene from a play unknown



Let's play a love scene

Let's play a love scene

We don't need the violins to play a love scene

Where we see how love begins

Find a way to start and learn to play the part

A perfect scene from a play unknown



Let's play a

Let's play a

Let's play a love scene of our own
