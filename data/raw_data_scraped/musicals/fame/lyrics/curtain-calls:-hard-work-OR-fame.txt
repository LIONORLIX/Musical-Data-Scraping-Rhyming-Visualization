Curtain Calls: Hard Work / Fame


I'm alive and I will survive

Show the world that I can take it

When I hit the heights

Put my name in lights



Show the world that I can

Make it by doin'

doin', doin' doin'

By doin' hard work



Baby look at me

And tell me what you see

You ain't seen the best of me yet

Give me time I'll make you forget the rest



I got more in me

And you can set it free

I can catch the moon in my hands

Don't you know who I am



Remember my name

Fame



I'm gonna live forever

I'm gonna learn how to fly

High



I feel it coming together

People will see me and cry

Fame



I'm gonna make it to heaven

Light up the sky like a flame

Fame



I'm gonna live forever

Baby remember my name



Remember

Remember

Remember

Remember

Remember

Remember

Remember

Remember
