I Want to Make Magic (Reprise)


I want to make magic

I want to strike lightning in the sky

I want to do things you can't believe anyone would try

I want to make magic



I want to make magic

Make every moment a surprise

I'll capture your senses in a spell

Right before your eyes

I want to make magic



I want to make you think it's really real

I want to make you love the nobles roman

Weep for Willy Loman

Dream the dreams of Blanche du Bois



I want to make you laugh and roar and squeal



I want to guillotine the villain's neck off

Take a shot at Chekhov

Make it a rollercoaster ride up to a star!



I want to make magic

I want to take chances that are bold

I want to tell stories no one knows

That no one's ever told.



Now the audience is still

And the house lights are gone

Curtain going up

And I am on!



I want to do it all from A to Z

I want to do "The Lion In Winter"

Brecht and Harold Pinter

Sophocles, Eugene O'Neill



I want a chance to see what I can be

Another Jason Robards or De Niro

Play a tragic hero

Go for it all and really show the way I feel/



I want to make magic!



I want to make magic



Magic!



I want to make magic



Magic!



A thousand chances we can take

But it's all worth it when we make ...



Magic!

Magic!

Magic!

Magic!

Magic!

Magic!



Magic!



Magic!
