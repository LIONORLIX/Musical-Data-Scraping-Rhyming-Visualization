Hard Work


This ain't no

Movie show

Playin' in the theater

Or a video



Fantasy

I was always hot to see

On the T.V.



I'm so hot, hot to trot

I can hardly wait to show them what I got

Wonder who'll come out shinin' like a jewel

In the 'Fame' school



Here we are

So bizarre

This is where they show you

How to be a star



I can't wait

I can't even concentrate

I just pulsate



Class to class, try'n' to pass

Learnin' who the teachers are who bust your ass

Feelin' small, feeling up against the wall

During roll call



I'm alive and I will survive

Show the world that I can take it

When I hit the heights

Put my name in lights



Show the world that I can

Make it by doin'

doin', doin' doin'

By doin' hard work



By doin' hard work

By doin' hard work

Hard work
