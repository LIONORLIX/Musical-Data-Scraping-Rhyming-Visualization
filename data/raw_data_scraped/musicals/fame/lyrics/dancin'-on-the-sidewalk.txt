Dancin' on the Sidewalk


Everyday, I'll wake up in the mornin'

Splash my face to keep myself from yawnin'

Get dressed and get my bones together

Open the window to check out the weather



Then like I seen a ghost, man

I'll be movin' my feet

Just like the postman in the cold or the heat

No time to talk and I go dancin' on the sidewalk



Dancin' on the sidewalk

Dancin' on the sidewalk

Dancin' on the sidewalk



Lunchtime is music to my ears

I'm down on Wallstreet with all the financiers

South Street Seaport I am the action

The number one tourist attraction



Hip hop to the West Side

Where I do myself proud

The West Side is the best side for drawin' a crowd

The cabbies squawk when I go dancin' on the sidewalk



Dancin' on the sidewalk

Dancin' on the sidewalk

Dancin' on the sidewalk



Dancin' on the sidewalk

Dancin' on the sidewalk

Dancin' on the sidewalk



Uptown I do my boogaloo

Stoppin' traffic on Seventh Avenue

Nighttime the corner to be on

Times Square under the neon



For my finale

I'll be doin' my thing

In Shubert Alley

They're gonna crown me the king

Of all New York



Because I'm dancin', dancin', dancin' woo

Dancin' on the sidewalk



Dancin' on the sidewalk

Dancin' on the sidewalk

Dancin' on the sidewalk

Dancin' on the sidewalk
