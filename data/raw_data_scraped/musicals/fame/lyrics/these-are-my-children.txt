These Are My Children


In times of trouble

When all the world seems, oh, so dark

And I can't find a way to cope



When deep down inside me

I can no longer feel the spark

When I can see no ray of hope



When I am lost

What makes it all worthwhile

One simple thought to make me smile



These are my children

My saving grace

I see my calling

In every face



These are my children

And I thank God

For choosing me, for choosing me



I wasn't blessed

As other women in this life

To have my own, to be mother and wife



But I was blessed

Beyond where wildest dreams can reach

For I have the privilege

Yes, the privilege to teach



These are my children

My saving grace

I see my calling

In every face



These are my children

My family tree

And I thank God

And I thank God



Yes, I thank God

For choosing me

For choosing me

These are my children
