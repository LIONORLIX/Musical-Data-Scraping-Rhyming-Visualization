Let's Play a Love Scene


We always seem to be

Sister and brotherly

It's such a lovely way to be



And I want to say

What it means to me

How I could never be the same without you



And something more that I know

Though I never could show

How it kept right on growing



The way I know I really feel about you

The way I know I'll always feel about you

Why can't we, why can't we, why can't we try



To play a love scene

We don't need the violins to play a love scene

Where we see how love begins



If we could find a way to start

And learn to play the part

A perfect scene from a play unknown

Let's play a love scene, of our own



And I want to say what it means to me

How I could never be the same without you

And something more that I know

Though I never could show

How it kept right on growing



The way I know I really feel about you

The way I know I'll always feel about you

Why can't we, why can't we, why can't we try



To play a love scene

We don't need the violins to play a love scene

Where we see how love begins



Find a way to start and play it from the heart

A perfect scene from a play unknown

Let's play a love scene

Love scene of our own
