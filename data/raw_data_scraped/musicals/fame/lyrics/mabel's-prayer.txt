Mabel's Prayer


Oh Lord give me a sign

Give me a call on your heavenly line

Tell me, oh Lord, what it is that you want of me

Keep me from eatin' whatever's in front of me



Oh Lord give me a sign

Oh Lord give her a sign

Give her a call on your heavenly line

Call me up, call me up on your heavenly line



Tell her oh Lord, what it is that you want of her

Tell me oh save me

Keep her from eatin' whatever's in front of her

Save me from eatin' whatever's in front of me



Oh Lord, give me the answer

Ooh, ah

Save me from being the world's fattest dancer

Ooh
