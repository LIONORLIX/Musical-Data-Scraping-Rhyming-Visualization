There She Goes! /Fame


There she goes

Ain't she the picture of a real live star?

You want to follow her whoever you are

And there she goes



She's passin' you

You better hurry if you wanna look

Maybe you'll get her in your autograph book

She's passin' you



Reach out to touch, don't be shy

There ain't no reason to be scared

No it's too much I can't look her in the eye

No I'm not prepared



I'm on top of the charts

I'm on top in their hearts

Look at them all

Look at the crowds

Everything is beautiful up here in the clouds



Fame

I'm gonna live forever

I'm gonna learn how to fly

I feel it comin' together

People will see me and cry



Fame

I'm gonna make it to heaven

Light up the sky like a flame



Fame

I'm gonna live forever

Baby remember my name



Remember

Remember

Remember

Remember

Remember

Remember



Voy a vivir pa' siempre

Voy allegar a volar

Fame

estrella en todo'el cielo

que em pe zara a brillar



Voy a vivir pa' siempre

Voy allegar a volar, volar

estrella en todo'el cielo

Mira, Mira

Quiero brillar



I'm on top of the charts

I'm on top in their hearts

Look at the crowds

Look at them all

Ay mamacita mia, I'm havin' a ball



There she goes

There she goes

There she goes

There she goes

Now wouldn't anybody wish they were her

Wish they were her

And there she goes



Remember

Remember

Remember

Remember

Remember my name
