Hard Work (Reprise)


Work, work, work

Hard work,

Work, hard work, work, hard work

Work, hard work

Work, work, work, work

Hard work, hard work



I'm alive

And I will survive

Show the world that I can take it

When I hot the heights

Put my name in lights



Yes I'm gonna put my name in lights, yeah!



Show the world that I can make it

By doin' doin' doin' doin'

By doin' Hard Work!



By doin' Hard Work!

By doin' Hard Work!

By doin' Hard Work!



Hard Work!
