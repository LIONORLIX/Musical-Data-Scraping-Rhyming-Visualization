Bring on Tomorrow (Reprise)


We Have Arrived, At A Moment In Our Lives

When The Future Passes Into Our Hands

We Can Find Out Are We Really Strong Enough

To Fulfill What The Future Demands



We Can Stand On The Edge And Look Out Into Space

And Be Awed By The Wonders We See



We Can All Make A Pledge That The Whole Human Race

Will Become What We Want It To Be



Bring On Tomorrow, Let It Shine

Like The Sun Coming Up On A Beautiful Day

It's Yours And Mine, We Can Make A Difference

It's Not Too Late

Bring On Tomorrow, We Can't Wait



Long Long Ago, In A World We Never Made

We Were Children Who Were Making Belief

Closing Our Eyes, We Were Travelers In Heir

To A Land We Would Not Want To Leave



But This Fairy Tale Land (Fairy Tale Land)

Fades Away As We Grow (As We Grow)

And We All Have To Say Our Goodbyes (Bye, Bye)



And We Now Understand

That This World That We Know

Can Be Ours, If We Open Our Eyes



Bring On Tomorrow, Let It Shine

Like The Sun Coming Up On A Beautiful Day

It's Yours And Mine, We Can Make A Difference

It's Not Too Late

Bring On Tomorrow, We Can't Wait



Bring On Tomorrow, We Can't Wait

Bring On Tomorrow, It's Not Too Late

Bring On Tomorrow, We Can't Wait

Bring On Tomorrow, We Can't Wait



Bring On Tomorrow, Let It Shine

Like The Sun Coming Up On A Beautiful Day

It's Yours And Mine, We Can Make A Difference

It's Not Too Late

Bring On Tomorrow, We Can't Wait



Bring On Tomorrow, We Can't Wait
