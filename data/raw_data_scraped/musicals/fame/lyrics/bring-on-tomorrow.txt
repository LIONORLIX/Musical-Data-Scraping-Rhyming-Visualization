Bring on Tomorrow


We have arrived at a moment in our lives

When the future passes into out hands

We can find out, are we really strong enough

To fulfill what the future demands



We can stand on the edge

And look out into space

And be awed

By the wonders we see



We can all make a pledge

That the whole human race

Will become what we want it to be



Bring on tomorrow

Let it shine

Like the sun coming up on a beautiful day

It's yours and mine



We can make a difference

It's not too late

Bring on tomorrow

We can't wait



Long, long ago in a world we never made

We were children who were making believe

Closing our eyes

We were travelers in air

To a land we would not want to leave



But the fairy tale land, fades away as we grow

And we all have to say our goodbyes

And we now understand, that this world that we know

Can be ours if we open our eyes



Bring on tomorrow

Let it shine

Like the sun coming up on a beautiful day

It's yours and mine



We can make a difference

It's not too late

Bring on tomorrow

We can't wait



Bring on tomorrow

We can't wait

Bring on tomorrow

It's not too late



Bring on tomorrow

We can't wait

Bring on tomorrow

We can't wait



Bring on tomorrow

Let it shine

Like the sun coming up on a beautiful day

It's yours and mine



We can make a difference

It's not too late

Bring on tomorrow

We can't wait



Bring on tomorrow

We can't wait
