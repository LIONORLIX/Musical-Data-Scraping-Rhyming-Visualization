I Want to Make Magic


I want to make magic

I want to be bigger than I am

I want to make people really care

Really give a damn



I want to make magic

I want to breathe fire on the stage

I want to make every single line

Jump right off the page



I want to do it all from A to Z

I want to do 'The Lion in Winter'

Brecht and Harold Pinter

Sophocles, Eugene O'Neill



I want to really see what I can be

Another Jason Robards or DeNiro

Play a tragic hero

Go for it all and really show the way I feel



I want to make magic

I want to electrify the place

I want to be more than just a fool

With make-up on his face



I want to make magic

Magic

Magic
