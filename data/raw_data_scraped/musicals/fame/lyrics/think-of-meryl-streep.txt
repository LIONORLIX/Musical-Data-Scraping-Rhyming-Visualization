Think of Meryl Streep


Think of how to use it

Use it on the stage

Think of Katherine Hepburn

Think of Gerry Page



Think of all the feelings

Wasted on this creep

Think of how you could use them

Think of Meryl Streep



Why should I be crazy

Spilling out my guts

Make a big explosion

Go completely nuts



These are my emotions

Mine alone to keep

I know I could use them

Think of Meryl Streep



Inside me there's a world of color and light

Nothing has to be wrong

Nothing has to be right

Inside me are treasures that glow



An actress's job is to know what she's willing to show

And then hide all the rest so no-one's the wiser

Save up all the best, like Midas the miser

Keep every moment under control

Always in charge, playing a role



Smile and shrug your shoulders

Make believe it's fine

Come up with an answer

Or a witty line



Though your heart is breaking

Never start to weep

Someday you can use it

Someday you can use it

Someday you can use it

Think of Meryl Streep
