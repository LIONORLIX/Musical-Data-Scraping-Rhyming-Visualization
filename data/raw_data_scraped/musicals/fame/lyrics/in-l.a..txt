In L.A.


Out in L.A. and broke on the ticket that this fellow sent me

One change of clothes in the suitcase my girlfriend Anna lent me

I stayed for awhile in his place, runnin' with this crowd of his

Partyin' day after day, meetin' everybody in the biz



Oh, they know how to do it in L.A.

They know how to make it seem brand new

Though it's true what they say, that it's only a dream

And a dream is a wish you wish for you

In L.A the dream may come true



After the booze and the coke

The visions of the blue Pacific

After the two hundredth time

I told him he was just terrific



I woke up one late afternoon

And couldn't tell quite where I was

Left-over taste in my mouth

And the morning after buzz



I packed my bag and split and found myself a dancin' job

Worked the bar for tips and stripped for every lonely slob

Counted every single minute as the hours went by

Then fell in bed and cried til there were no more tears to cry



You try to stop the thought from comin'

That it never ends

You think about how far you are

From home and friends



You get thru one day at a time

You find a way of stayin' numb

Don't look in the mirror

To see what you've become



But they know how to do it in L.A.

They know hot to make it seem so new

Though it's true what they say

That's it's only a dream

And a dream is a wish you wish for you

In L.A. the dream may come true



Yes, they know how to do it in L.A.

They know how to make it seem brand new

Though it's true what they say, that it's only a dream

And a dream is a wish you wish for you

In L.A, in L.A., in L.A. the dreams may all come...



Yes, they know how to do it in L.A.

They know that somewhere the sky is blue

So smile when they say 'It's only a dream'

And you'll get what is comin' to you

In L.A, in L.A., in L.A. the dreams all come true
