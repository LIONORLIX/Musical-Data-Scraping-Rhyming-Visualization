LITTLE MOE:

Hey, dad gum your hide boy

dad gum your dirty hide

dad gum you dirty dog, I gave you a pig

and you wanted a hog.



EAT MOE:

I took you in when you were beat

you were almost dead

I gave you some good food to eat

and a place to rest your head

I even let you wear my brand new suit

let you wear my new shoes

and when you asked me for money

I never did refuse

look at him laughing

LITTLE MOE:

Yeah, then you met my baby

who is the apple of my heart

well I could tell from the way you looked at her

that trouble was bound to start

'coz you started in with all your jivin'

you made her think the moon was green

well you know Daddy I think

you are the mose convincingest fellah I have ever seen.

NO MOE:

I thought he was my buddy

I thought he was my pal

hah! He did me out of all my money

and then he tries to steal my gal

but one of these days I'm gonna get even

but in the meantime I hope he takes another drink

stands up and drops dead

and you wanted a hog.



EAT MOE:

Yes and you cam into my house

and you ate my spaghetti and meatballs

you wore my brand new suit

and you wore my brand new shoes

you beat me out of all my money, and you stole my wife,

and boy I'm telling you nobody, but nobody eats my food,

listen I should get you a short stick boy

and beat you so bad

I'm angry now, somebody hold me back,

I mean it, boy am I angry, somebody hold me back,

hold me back, I mean it, somebody hold me back.
