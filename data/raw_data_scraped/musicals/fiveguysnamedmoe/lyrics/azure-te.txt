Azure Te


FOUR EYED MOE:



Gone and got the blues in Paris

Paris blues called Azure te

How could I be blue in Paris?

Easy, coz she's far away

can't lose these blues, this Azure te



Sidewalk tables are filled with people

always happy, always gay

still I'm alone, alone in Paris

praying she'll come back to stay

can't lose those blues, this Azure te



can't lose those blues, this Azure te



If you knew how much I need you

you'd come back to me and stay

I need you with me in Paris

really is the only way

to lose these blues, this Azure te



Ah, must lose those blues,

this azure te

must lose these blues,

this azure te

can't lose these blues,

this azure te.
