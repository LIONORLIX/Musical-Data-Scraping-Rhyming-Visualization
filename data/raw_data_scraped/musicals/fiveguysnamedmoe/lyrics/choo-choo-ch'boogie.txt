Choo Choo Ch'Boogie


FOUR EYED MOE:

All aboard



LITTLE MOE:

Headin' for the station with a pack on my back

I'm tired of transportation in the back of a hack

I'd love to hear the rhythm of the clicketty clack

and hear the lonesome whistle see the smoke

from the stack

and pal around with the democratic fellows named Mac

take me right back to the track Jack.



ALL:

Choo choo, choo choo, ch'boogie

woo woo, woo woo, ch'boogie

choo choo, choo choo, ch'boogie

take me right back to the track Jack.



LITTLE MOE:

You reach your destination but alas and alack

you need some compensation to get back in the black

you take a morning paper from the top of the stack

and read the situations from the front to the back

the only job that's open need a man with a knack

so put it right back in the rack Jack.



ALL:

Choo choo, choo choo, ch'boogie

woo woo, woo woo, ch'boogie

choo choo, choo choo, ch'boogie

take me right back to the track Jack.



FOUR EYED MOE:

I'm gonna settle down by the railroad track

live the life of reilly in a beaten down shack

so when I hear the whistle I can peep through the crack

and watch the train a-rolling when it's balling the jack

for I just love the rhythm of the clicketty clack

so take me right back to the track jack.



ALL:

Choo choo, choo choo, ch'boogie

woo woo, woo woo, ch'boogie

choo choo, choo choo, ch'boogie

take me right back to the track Jack.



ALL: LITTLE MOE:

Take me I'm heading for the station

Take me and I need some transportation

Take me so I reach my destination

Take me right back to the track jack.



ALL: LITTLE MOE:

Take me Yeah I'll reach my destination

Take me and I need some compensation

Take me so I read the situations

Take me right back to the track Jack.
