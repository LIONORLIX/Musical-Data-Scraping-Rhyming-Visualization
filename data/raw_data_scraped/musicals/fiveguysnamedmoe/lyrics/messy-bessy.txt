Messy Bessy


LITTLE MOE:

Now I'm a very conservative fella,

and I don't go in for displays of emotion,

but I'm in love with a chick named Bessy,

and she cuts up whenever she takes the notion.



Now she ain't high class like I am,

So sometimes she gets carried away,

and that's when she starts to goofin' up,

and this is what you'll hear me say:



Don't get messy, Bessy,

keep your whiskey quiet,

when you had a couple of drinks, woman,

you just might start a riot,

don't get messy, Bessy,

you know what I'm talking about,

when your love comes a tumblin' down,

you wear a good man out.



Now when that whiskey moves you,

you start snappin' your fingers,

and shoutin' out loud,

you start shakin' an' quakin',

an' whoopin' an hollerin',

you talk so loud you draw a crowd,

so don't get messy, Bessy,

try to play it cool,

coz you just wait til I get you home mama,

and I'll get messy too.



Now when that whiskey moves you,

Now don't get messy, Bessy,

try to play it cool,

coz you wait til I get you home mama,

and I'll get messy too.

One more time,

you just wait till I get you home mama,

and I'll get messy too.

say you just wait till I get you home mama,

and I'll get messy too.

You better straighten up and fly right woman!
