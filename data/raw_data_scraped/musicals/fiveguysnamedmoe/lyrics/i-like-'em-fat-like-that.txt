I Like 'Em Fat Like That


LITTLE MOE:

You know I like being surrounded by such voluptuosity,

such poultritude, to be mothered and smothered,

basted in sweet sumptuosness.



Let the cats all criticise,

joke about my baby's size,

she's reet with me because you see,

I likes 'em fat like that.



When she bounces down the street,

she's a whole heap of honey and ain't she sweet,

feels so fine to know that she is mine,

I likes 'em fat like that.



You can have all those lean chicks tender and tall,

but when it comes to mean kicks,

a big fat momma's the best of all,

after I get through working well I reach and grab my hat,

and I hurry home,

don't want her to be alone, coz

I likes 'em fat like that.



ALL:

Tell me why do you like them



LITTLE MOE:

More bounce to the ounce



ALL:

Say why do you like 'em?



LITTLE MOE:

More room to rump



ALL:

How big do you like 'em?



LITTLE MOE:

Tons of fun



ALL:

How wide do you like 'em?



LITTLE MOE:

Well, like that.



ALL:

So you like 'em like that.



LITTLE MOE:

Yeh, I'm a chubby chaser.



ALL:

Ooh, look at her go.



LITTLE MOE:

Don't try to run



ALL:

Ooh, it must be jelly, 'cos jam don't shake like that.



LITTLE MOE:

You can have all those lean chicks tender and tall,

but when it comes to mean kicks,

a big fat momma's the best of all,

after I get through working well I reach and grab my hat,

and I hurry home,

don't want her to be alone, coz

I likes 'em fat like that,

now thin may be in, but fat is where it's at!
