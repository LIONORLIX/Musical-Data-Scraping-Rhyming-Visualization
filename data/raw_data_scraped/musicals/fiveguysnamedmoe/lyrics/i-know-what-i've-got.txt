I Know What I've Got


NOMAX:

Sometimes she treats me fine

then gets way out of line

but still in all I'm sticking like glue

coz I know what I've got

but I dont know what I'm getting

so baby I'm with you.



I thought I'd try to switch

and find me someone rich

but told myself how big could I get

coz I know what I've got

but I dont know what I'm getting

so baby I'm all set.



My friends say i could do a lot better

if this keeps up I'll soon need a nurse

I know I can't do any better

but believe me I could do a lot worse.



Let's have it understood

it's you and me for good

and anyone that doubts it's gotta go

coz I know what I've got

but I dont know what I'm getting

here's domething you should know.



Well I forgot to tell her

that I love her do
