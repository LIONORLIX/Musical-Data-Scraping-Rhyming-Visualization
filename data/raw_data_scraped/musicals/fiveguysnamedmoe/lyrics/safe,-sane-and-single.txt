Safe, Sane And Single


EAT MOE:

A woman is the sweetest thing

on that we all agree

but when she gets the wedding band

a mans no longer free



That's why I'm safe, sane and single

I'm on my merry way

Yes I'm safe, sane and single

that's how I'm gonna stay



LITTLE MOE:

A wife and husband came upon

the parting of their ways

the judge gave her the bank account

and gave him 90 days



That's why I'm safe, sane and single

I'm on my merry way

Yes I'm safe, sane and single

that's how I'm gonna stay



BIG MOE:

A friend of mine got married

to a gal named Nellie Gray

she pawned his watch then sold his car

and gave his clothes away



That's why I'm safe, sane and single

I'm on my merry way

Yes I'm safe, sane and single

that's how I'm gonna stay



NO MOE:

I met a gal in Birmingham

and thereby hangs a tale

she had a husband doing time

another out on bail



That's why I'm safe, sane and single

I'm on my merry way

Yes I'm safe, sane and single

that's how I'm gonna stay



NOMAX:

Ha, ha ,ha, I got one



I courted a gal for 15 years

her Pa said we should wed

if my horse could only cook

I'd marry him instead



ALL:

That's why I'm safe, sane and single

I'm on my merry way

Yes I'm safe, sane and single

that's how I'm gonna stay



Thank God I'm safe, Thank God I'm safe,

Yes I'm safe, sane and single

that how I'm gonna stay

Thank God I'm safe, Thank God I'm safe,

Yes I'm safe, sane and single

that how I'm gonna stay!

Thank God I'm safe, Thank God I'm safe,

Yes I'm safe, sane and single

that how I'm gonna stay!



NO MOE:

Now you got that?
