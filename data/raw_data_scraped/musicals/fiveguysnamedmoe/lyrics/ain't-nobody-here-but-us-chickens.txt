Ain't Nobody Here But Us Chickens


NO MOE:

OK folks here's a little story just for you

now one night Farmer brown was takin' the air

he locked up the farmyard with the greatest of care

but down in the hen-house something stirred

and when he shouted 'Whos there?"

this is what he heard



FOUR EYED MOE:

There ain't nobody here but us chickens

There ain't nobody here at all

so quiet yourself and stop that fuss

there ain't nobody here but us

we chickens tryin' to sleep, and you butt in

and hobble hobble hobble hobble it's a sin



NO MOE:

Now Farmer brown lit his corn cobbed pipe

he looked down at his trusty dog

and he said, "Hey id the chickens said they alright

they are alright.

Let's head back to the shack Jack". But the dog wasn't

convinced, he said "Go back to the henhouse" gave a

little doggy knock and in his best chickenese said

"Is everything alright?"



FOUR EYED MOE:

I said there ain't nobody here but us chickens

There ain't nobody here at all

you're stompin' around and checkin' around

and kickin' up an awful fuss

we chickens tryin' to sleep, and you butt in

and hobble hobble hobble hobble it's a sin



NO MOE:

"Ok, ok, ok," said the dog and he turned to leave

just then a very unchicken like sneeze came

from the henhouse "Achoo!"

Farmer Brown cocked his gun, he syas "I'm a comin' in,

you better open that door just a teeny weeny

bit so I can take a peek"



FOUR EYED MOE:

NO! Tomorrow is a busy day

we got things to do, we got eggs to lay,

ground to dig, we've got worms to scratch,

you know it takes a lot of sittin' gettin' chicks to hatch

besides - there aint nobody here but us chickens

there ain't nobody here at all

so stop that fuss and raisin' dust

hey there ain't nobody here but us

so kindly point that gun the other way

and hobble hobble hobble off and hit the hay.



NO MOE:

Okay, I guess you're right, I'm off

to sleep. Goddnight.

Hey Boss man, what d'ya think?



FOUR EYED MOE:

Easy pickin's, ain't nobody here but us chickens.
