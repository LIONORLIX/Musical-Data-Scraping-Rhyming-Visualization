Don't Let The Sun Catch You Crying


EAT MOE:

Dn't let the sun catch you cryin'

cryin' round my front door

you done your baby so dirty

that's why she don't want you no more



and don't let the sun catch you lyin'

lyin' round my front door

your baby done gone and turned salty

and you know you made her do so.



You can cry, cry, cry

I know that you know how to wail

and you can beat your head on the pavement

until the man comes and throws you in jail.



but don't let the sun catch you cryin'

cryin' round my front door

you done your baby so dirty

that's why she don't want you no more.



Cry, and wail

and you can beat your head on the pavement

until the man comes and throws you in jail,

but don't let the sun catch you cryin'

cryin' round my front door



Oh when the moon goes down

in the dawnin',

and the sun comes up in the mornin',

don't let the sun catch you cryin'

when the moon goes down in the dawnin',

don't let the sun catch you cryin',

coz baby don't want you no more,

no more,

no more.
