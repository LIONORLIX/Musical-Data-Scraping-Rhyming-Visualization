Mr. Cellophane


Amos:

If someone stood up in a crowd

And raised his voice up way out loud

And waved his arm and shook his leg

You'd notice him



If someone in the movie show

Yelled "Fire in the second row

This whole place is a powder keg!"

You'd notice him



And even without clucking like a hen

Everyone gets noticed, now and then,

Unless, of course, that personage should be

Invisible, inconsequential me!



Cellophane

Mister Cellophane

Shoulda been my name

Mister Cellophane

'Cause you can look right through me

Walk right by me

And never know I'm there...



I tell ya

Cellophane

Mister Cellophane

Shoulda been my name

Mister Cellophane

'Cause you can look right through me

Walk right by me

And never know I'm there...



Suppose you was a little cat

Residin' in a person's flat

Who fed you fish and scratched your ears?

You'd notice him



Suppose you was a woman, wed

And sleepin' in a double bed

Beside one man, for seven years

You'd notice him



A human being's made of more than air

With all that bulk, you're bound to see him there

Unless that human bein' next to you

Is unimpressive, undistinguished

You know who...



Cellophane

Mister Cellophane

Shoulda been my name

Mister Cellophane

'Cause you can look right through me

Walk right by me

And never know I'm there...

I tell ya

Cellophane

Mister Cellophane

Shoulda been my name

Mister Cellophane

'Cause you can look right through me

Walk right by me

And never know I'm there

Never even know I'm there.



Hope I didn't take up too much of your time.
