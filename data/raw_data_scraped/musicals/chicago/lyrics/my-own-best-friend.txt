My Own Best Friend


Roxie:

One thing I know



Velma:

One thing I know



Roxie:

And I've always known



Velma:

And I've always known



Roxie:

I am my own



Velma:

I am my own



Roxie & Velma:

Best friend



Roxie:

Baby's alive



Velma:

Baby's alive



Roxie:

But baby's alone



Velma:

But baby's alone



Roxie:

And baby's her own



Velma:

And baby's her own



Roxie & Velma:

Best friend

Many's the guy

Who told me he cares

But they were scratchin' my back

'Cause I was scratchin' theirs



Roxie:

And trusting to luck



Velma:

And trusting to luck



Roxie:

That's only for fools



Velma:

Only for fools



Roxie:

I play in a game



Velma:

I play in a game



Roxie & Velma:

Where I make the rules

And rule number one

From here to the end

Is 'I am my own best friend'



Three musketees

Who never say die

Are standing here this minute



Velma:

Me



Roxie:

Me



Velma:

Myself



Roxie:

Myself



Velma:

And I!



Roxie:

And I!



Velma & Roxie:

If life is a school

I'll pass every test

If life is a game

I'll play it the best

'Cause I won't give in

and I'll never bend

and I am my own best friend!
