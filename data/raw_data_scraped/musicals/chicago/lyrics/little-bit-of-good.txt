Little Bit of Good


Mary Sunshine:

When I was a tiny tot

Of maybe two or three

I can still remember what

My mother said to me...



Place rose colored glasses on your nose

And you will see the robins

Not the crows



For in the tense and tangled web

Our weary lives can weave

You're so much better off

If you believe...



That there's a little bit of good

In everyone

In everyone you'll ever know



Yes, there's a little bit of good

In everyone

Though many times, it doesn't show



It only takes a taking time

With one another

For under every mean veneer

Is someone warm and dear

Keep looking...



For that bit of good in everyone

The ones you call bad

Are never all bad

So try to find that little bit of good



Just a little, little bit of good



Is someone warm and dear

Keep looking...



For that little good in everyone

Although you meet rats

They're not complete rats

So try to find that little bit of good!



Matron:

Mr. Flynn, the reporters are here.

Billy:

Let 'em in, Butch. Okay, Roxie, act like a dummy; you sit

on my lap and do all the talking.



Matron:

Mr. Billy Flynn sings the "Press Conference Rag" - notice

how his mouth never moves - almost.
