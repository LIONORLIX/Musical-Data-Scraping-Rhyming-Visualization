When Velma Takes the Stand


Velma:

Billy, I been thinkin' a lot about my trial. Couldn't I just

show you what I thought I might do on the witness stand?



Billy:

Go ahead.



Velma:

Good! Hit it!

Well then, when I got on the stand I thought I'd take a peek

at the jury. Then I'd cross my legs like this, you know.



Quartette:

When Velma takes the stand



Velma:

Then, when Harrison cross examines me, I thought I'd give 'em

this...and then if he yells at me I thought I'd tremble like

this..."ooh, no, please stop!"



Quartette:

When Velma takes the stand

Look at little Vel

See her give 'em hell

When she turns it on

Ain't she doin' grand?

She's got 'em eating out of the palm of her hand!



Velma:

Then, I thought I'd let it all be too much for me, like real

dramatic. Then, I thought I'd get thirsty and say, "Please,

someone, could I have a glass of water?"



Quartette::

When Velma takes the stand

See that Kelly girl

Make that jury whirl

When she turns it on

She's gonna get 'em goin'

'Till she's got 'em gone



Velma:

Ah! Ah! Ah! Then, I thought I'd cry. Buckets. Only I don't

have handkerchief - that's when I have to ask you for yours!

I really like that part. Don't you? Then, I get up and try to

walk; oh, but I'm too weak, and I slump and I slump and I

slump and I slump until finally, I faint!



Quartette:

When she rolls her eyes

Watch her take the prize

When Velma takes the stand!

When Velma takes the stand!
