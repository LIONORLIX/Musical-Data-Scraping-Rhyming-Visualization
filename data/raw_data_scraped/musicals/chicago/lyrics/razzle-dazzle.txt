Razzle Dazzle


Bailiff:

Mr. Flynn, his honor is here



Billy:

Thank you. Just a moment. You ready?



Roxie:

Oh Billy, I'm so scared!



Billy:

Roxie. You got nothing to worry about. It's all a circus, kid.

A three ring circus. These trial - the whole world - all show

business. But kid, you're working with a star, the biggest!



Give 'em the old razzle dazzle

Razzle dazzle 'em

Give 'em act with lots of flash in it

And the reaction will be passionate

Give 'em the old hocus pocus

Bread and feather 'em

How can they see with sequins in their eyes?



What if your hinges all are rusting?

What if, in fact, you're just disgusting ?



Razzle dazzle 'em

And they'll never catch wise!

Eh Eh Eh Eh

Ah! Ah! Ah!

Give 'em the old razzle dazzle



Billy and Company:

Razzle dazzle 'em

Give 'em a show that's so splendiferous



Billy:

Row after row will grow vociferous



Billy and Company:

Give 'em the old flim flam flummox

Fool and fracture 'em



Billy:

How can they hear the truth above the roar?



Billy and Company:

Throw 'em a fake and a finagle

They'll never know you're just a bagel,



Billy:

Razzle dazzle 'em

And they'll beg you for more!



Billy and Company:

Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!

Give 'em the old razzle dazzle

Razzle dazzle 'em

Back since the days of old Methuselah

Everyone loves the big bambooz-a-ler



Give 'em the old three ring circus

Stun and stagger 'em

When you're in trouble, go into your dance

Though you are stiffer than a girder

They let ya get away with a murder

Razzle dazzle 'em

And you've got a romance



Give 'em the old

Razzle dazzle



Billy:

Razzle dazzle 'em

Give 'em an act that's unassailable

They'll wait a year 'til your available!



Billy and Company:

Give 'em the old

Double whammy



Billy:

Daze and dizzy 'em

Show 'em the first rate sorcerer you are



Billy and Company:

Long as you keep 'em way off balance

How can they spot you got no talents?



Billy:

Razzle dazzle 'em



Company:

Razzle dazzle 'em



Billy:

Razzle dazzle 'em



Billy and Company:

And they'll make you a star!
