All I Care About


Girls:

We want Billy

Give us Billy

B. I. Double L. Y.

We're all his

He's our kind of a guy

And ooh what luck

'Cause here he is...



Billy:

Is everybody here?

Is everybody ready?

Hit it!



I don't care about expensive things

Cashmere coats, diamond rings

Don't mean a thing

All I care about is love Girls:

That's what I'm here for That's what he's here for



I don't care for wearing silk cravats

Ruby studs, satin spats

Don't mean a thing

All I care about is love Girls:

All he cares about is love

Give me two

Eyes of blue

Softly saying, "I need you"

Let me see her standin' there

And honest, mister, I'm a millionaire



I don't care for any fine attire

Vanderbilt might admire

No, no, not me

All I care about is love Girls:

All he cares about is love



Billy:

Maybe you think I'm talking about my physical love. Well,

I'm not. Not just physical love. There's other kinds of

love. Like love of justice. Love of legal procedure. Love

of lending a hand to someone who really needs you. Love of

your fellow man. That's the kind of love I'm talkin' about.

And physical love ain't so bad either.



Billy:

It may sound odd

But all I care about is love Girls:

That's what I'm here for That's for he's here for

Honest to God

All I care about is love Girls:

All he cares about is love

Show me long raven hair

Flowin' down, about to three

Let me see

Her runnin' free

Keep your money, that's enough for me

I don't care for drivin' Packard cars

Or smoking long buck cigars

No, no, not me

All I care about is

Doin' the guy in

Who's pickin', on you

Twistin' the wrist

That's turnin' the screw

All I care about is love Girls:



All he cares about is love



Billy:

Now look, in a few minutes there'll be a whole bunch of

photographers and reporters and that sob sister from the

Evening Star is coming.

(a coloratura trill is heard off stage)



Billy:

I don't figure we'll have any trouble with her.

(another trill)

Billy:

She'll swallow hook, line and sinker.

(and another)

Her name is Mary Sunshine.
