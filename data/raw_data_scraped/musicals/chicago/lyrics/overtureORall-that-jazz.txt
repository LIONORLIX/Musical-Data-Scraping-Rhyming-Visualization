Overture/All That Jazz


ANNOUNCER:

Welcome. Ladies and Gentlemen, you are about to see a story of

murder, greed, corruption, violence, exploitation, adultery,

and treachery - all those things we all hold near and dear to

our hearts. Thank you.



(Instrumental)



Velma:

Come on, Babe

Why don't we paint the town?

And All That Jazz



I'm gonna rouge my knees

And roll my stockings down

And All That Jazz.



Start the car

I know a whoopee spot

Where the gin is cold

but the piano's hot

It's just a noisy hall

Where there's a nightly brawl

And All

That

Jazz!



[Dance break]



Slick your hair

And wear your buckle shoes

And All That Jazz!



I hear that father dip

Is gonna blow the blues

And All That Jazz



Hold on, hon

We're gonna bunny hug

I bought some Aspirin

Down at United Drug



In case you shake apart

And want a brand-new start

To do that -
