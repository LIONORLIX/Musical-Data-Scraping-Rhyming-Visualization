Me and My Baby


Roxie:

Me and my baby

My baby and me

We're 'bout as happy

As babies can be

What if I find

That I'm caught in a storm?

I don't care

My baby's there

And baby's bound to keep me warm

We're sticking together

And ain't we got fun

So much together

You'd count us as one

Tell old man, worry, to go climb a tree

'Cause I've got my baby

My sweet little baby

Look at my baby and me



Mary Sunshine:

I don't see how you could possibly delay the trial another

second, Mr. Flynn. My readers wouldn't stand for it. The

poor child! To have her baby born in a jail!



Billy:

I can assure you she'll come to trial at the earliest possible moment.

And you can quote me on that.



Amos:

Hey, everybody. I'm the father! I'm the father!



All:

Yuk! Yuk! Yuk! Yuk!



Roxie:

Looka my baby

My baby and me

A dream of a duo

Now, don't you agree?

Why keep it mum

When there's nothing to hide?

And what I feel

I must reveal

Is more than I can keep inside

Let me assure you

It won't go away

I can assure you

It grows every day

I was a one once

But now I'm a "we"

'Cause I got my baby

My dear little baby

Look at my baby and me



Matron:

I think it's sweet. First time we ever had one of our girls knocked up.



Billy:

I've got it and it's brilliant. I'm gonna get Amos to divorce

you. That way all the sympathy will go to you - not him.

You'll be the poor, little deserted mother-to-be and that

crumb is running out on you.



Amos:

That's my kid! That's my kid!



Roxie and Boys:

Looka my baby

My baby and me

Facing the world

Optimistically

Nothing can stop us

So nobody try

'Cause baby's rough

And full of stuff

And incidentally, so am I!

(Baby dance break.)

Get out of our way, folks

And give us some room

Watch how we bubble

And blossom and bloom

Life was a prison

But we got the key

Me and my baby

My dear little baby

My cute little baby

My sweet little baby

My fat little baby

My soft little baby

My pink little baby

My bald little baby

Looka, my baby and me



Amos:

I'm the father! Papa! Dada! Did you hear me? Did you?

No, you didn't hear me. That's the story of my life.

Nobody ever knows I'm around. Nobody. Not even my

parents noticed me. One day I went to school and when

I came home, they moved.
