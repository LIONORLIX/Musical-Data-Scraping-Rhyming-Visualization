I Can't Do It Alone


Velma:

My sister and I had an act that couldn't flop

My sister and I were headed straight for the top

My sister and I eared a thou a week at least

(Oh, sure)

But my sister is now, unfortunately, deceased



Oh, I know, it's sad, of course,

But a fact is still a fact

And now all that remains

Is the remains

Of a perfect double act!



Roxie, do you know you are exactly the same size as my sister?

Oh, you would fit in her wardrobe perfectly. Look, why don't I

just show you some of the act, huh?

Watch this.

(She dances)

Now, you have to imagine this with two people.

It's swell with two people.



First I'd....(Drums!)

Then she'd...(Saxophone!)

Then we'd...(Together!)

But I can't do it alone!

Then she'd...

Then I'd...

Then we'd...

But I can't do it alone!



She'd say, "What's your sister like?"

I'd say, "MEN,"

Yuk, yuk, yuk

She'd say, "you're the cat's meow"

Then we'd wow

The crowd again

When she'd go...

I'd go...

We'd go...



And then those ding-dong daddies started to roar

Whistled, stomped, and stamped on the floor

Yelling, screaming, begging for more.



And we'd say, "O.K. fellas, keep your socks up.

You ain't seen nothing yet!"



(She dances.)

Ah, aha, yeah!

But I simply cannot do it alone.



Well? What did ya think? Come on, you can say.

(Roxie gives her raspberry.)



Velma:

O.K. O.K. The first part can always be rewritten. But the

second part was really nifty. Watch this!



Then she'd...(See, get it, right?)

Then I'd...(Then I kick really high...)

Then we'd...

But I can't do it alone!

She'd say, "What state's Chicago in?"

I'd say, "ILL!"

Did ya get that?

She'd say, "turn your motor off!"

I can hear 'em cheerin' still

When she'd go...

I'd go...

We'd go...(Sideways!)

And then those two-bit Johnnies did it up brow

To cheer the best attraction in town

They really tore the balcony down



And we'd say, "O.K. fellas, O.K., we're goin' home, but

here's a few more partin' shots!" And this...this we did

in perfect unison.

(She dances.)

Cymbals crash crash crash

Now, you've seen me goin' through it

You can see there's nothin' to it

But I simply cannot do it

Alone!



(Roxie turns her down.)
