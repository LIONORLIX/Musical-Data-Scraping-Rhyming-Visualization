Come, see the new domains of God!

Come and dwell where Satan's hoof has never trod!

Where Satan's hoof has never trod!

We seek to find God's pardon,

Here innocence shall be restored,

In this new Eden Garden,

Where man has not defied his Lord.

Here shall ye find reward.

Come before your hearts in error harden.

Come, heathen of America!

Where innocence shall be restored,
