Words, Words, Words


MARTIN

Free will. Humanity. Love. Huh! Hah! Ha, ha!

Words, words, words, words,

I have no wordsTo describe the vanity of life,

The insane inanity of life, I have no words, but ha!



'Mid grime and slime

Why waste our time

Spouting some Spinoza monograph

Even one short Shakespeare epitaph.



They make me laugh, but wait!

It just occurred to me,

A word that may just possibly

Apply to all of usTrapped on this ball of dust.



Two tiny syllables but spiny syllables;

One single word-absurd.Ha! Absurd.

Don't make me laugh,

It hurts to laugh. Oho!



Don't make me laugh!

Don't make me titter!

All wheat is chaff,

All pills are bitter.



Nothing to trust in

This worst of all possible worlds.

All ends in dust in

This worst of all possible worlds.



Any questions?

Don't ask me now,

They're useless anyhow.



Were you in my position, friend,

Were you a humble sweeper,

Your thoughts on man's condition, friend,

Would be a little deeper.



If every blessed day, my friend,

Brought dung and bone and spittle

For you to clear away, my friend,

'T would change your mind a little.



Yes, dung and bone and spittle

And mud and trashAnd blood and ash

And souvenirs of lust

And every sort of residueIn process of reduction

To the final state of dust.

You'd laugh along with me, my friend,

You'd laugh until you'd bust!

Ha!
