Candide Begins His Travels - It Must Be Me


CANDIDE

My master told me

That men are loving-kind;

Yet now behold me,

III-used and sad of mind.



Men must have kindness

I cannot see.

It must be me.

It must be me.



My master told me

The world is warm and good;

It deals more coldly

Than I had dreamt it would.



There must be sunlight I cannot see.

It must be me.

It must be me.
