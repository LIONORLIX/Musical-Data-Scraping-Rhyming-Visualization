Auto Da Fe (What A Day)


CHORUS

What a day, what a day

For an auto-da-f?!

What a sunny summer sky!

What a day, what a day

For an auto-da-f?!

It's a lovely day for drinking

And for watching people fry!

Hurry, hurry, hurry,

Watch'em die!

Hurry, hurry, hurry,

Hang 'em high!

BEAR-KEEPER

See the great Russian bear!

COSMETIC MERCHANT

Buy a comb for your hair!

WOMEN

But the price is much too high!

DOCTOR

Here be potions and pills

For your fevers and chills!

WOMEN

But we haven't any money

So there's nothing we can buy!

JUNKMAN

Any kind of metal

Bought and sold!

ALCHEMIST

Any kind of metal

Turned to gold!

JUNKMAN

Pots and pans,

Metal cans,

Bought or traded or sold!

Pans and pots

And what-nots!

I Trading new ones for old!

ALCHEMIST

Pots and pans,

Metal cans,

I can turn them into gold!

Pans and pots

And what-nots!

For a tiny fee

My alchemy

Can turn them into gold!

CHORUS

Hurry, hurry, hurry,

Come and buy!

Hurry, hurry, hurry,

Come and try!

What a fair, what a fair!

Things to buy everywhere,

But the prices are too high!

It's not fair, it's not fair,

Things to buy everywhere;

But we haven't any money

So there's nothing we can buy!

PANGLOSS

But you can't execute me; I'm too sick to die!

CHORUS

What d ya mean sick?

PANGLOSS

Oh my darling Paquette,

She is haunting me yet

With a dear souvenir

I shall never forget.

'Twas a gift that she got

From a seafaring Scot,

He received he believed in Shalott!

In Shalott from his dame

Who was certain it came

With a kiss from a Swiss

(She'd forgotten his name),

But he told her that he

Had been given it free

By a sweet little cheat in Paree.

Then a man from Japan,

Then a Moor from Iran,

Though the Moor isn't sure

How the whole thing began;

But the gift we can see

Had a long pedigree

When at last it was passed on to me!

CHORUS

Then a man from Japan,

Then a Moor from Iran,

Though the Moor isn't sure

How the whole thing began;

But the gift we can see

Had a long pedigree

When at last it was passed on to he!

PANGLOSS

Love is sweet, love is sweet,

And the custom is sound,

For it makes the world go 'round.

CANDIDE, PANGLOSS

I repeat, love is sweet,

And the custom is sound,

For as we/I have shown it's love alone

That makes the world go 'round.

PANGLOSS

Well, the Moor in the end

Spent a night with a friend

And the dear souvenir

Just continued the trend

To a young English lord

Who was stung, they record,

By a wasp in a hospital ward!

Well, the wasp on the wing

Had occasion to sting

A Milano soprano

Who brought home the thing

To her young paramour,

Who was rendered impure,

And forsook her to look for the cure.

Thus he happened to pass

Through Westphalia, alas,

Where he met with Paquette,

And she drank from his glass.

I was pleased as could be

When it came back to me;

Makes us all just a small family!

CHORUS

Oh, he happened to pass

Through Westphalia, alas,

Where he met with Paquette,

And she drank from his glass.

He is pleased as can be

For it shows him that we

One and all are a small family!

PANGLOSS

I am pleased as can be

For it shows us that we

One and all are a small family !

CHORUS

What a day, what a day

For an auto-da-f?!

What a lovely day for drinking

And for watching people fry!

What a day, what a day,

Oh, what a day,

What a perfect day for hanging!

GRAND INQUISITOR

Silence!

INQUISITORS

Shall we let the sinners go or try them?

CHORUS

Try them.

INQUISITORS

Are the culprits innocent or guilty?

CHORUS

Guilty.

INQUISITORS

Shall we pardon them or hang them?

CHORUS

Hang them.

What a lovely day, what a jolly day,

What a day for a holiday!

He don't mix meat and dairy,

He don't eat humble pie,

So sing a miserere

And hang the bastard high!

INQUISITORS

Are our methods legal or illegal?

CHORUS

Legal.

INQUISITORS

Are we judges of the law, or laymen?

CHORUS

Amen.

INQUISITORS

Shall we hang them or forget them?

CHORUS

Get them!

What a perfect day, what a jolly day,

What a day for a holiday!

When foreigners like this come

To criticize and spy,

We chant a pax vobiscum,

And hang the bastard high!

GRAND INQUISITOR

The supreme moment has arrived. All ye faithful -

genuflect!

CHORUS, INQUISITORS

Oh, pray for us, pray for us!

Fons pietatis, pray for us!

Davidis turris, pray for us!

Rex majestatis, pray for us!

(The crowd scatters in fear.)

PANGLOSS

Ladies and gentlemen, one final word. God in his

wisdom made it possible to invent the rope...

aaargh.

CHORUS

What a lovely day what a jolly day,

What a day for a holiday!

At last we can be cheery,

The danger's passed us by.

So sing a Dies Irae

And hang the bastard high!

Oh, what a day!!

Pangloss is hanged, Candide flogged. Candide still believes

Pangloss was right.
