The Kings' Barcarolle


CHARLES EDWARD

I do hereby make a motion

In hopes of your approval

That after our removal

From this most unpleasant ocean

We all say farewell

To vanity and strife

And in some dale

Pursue the Simple Life.



CANDIDE

What a royal, royal notion!



HERMANN AUGUSTUS

I second Charles's motion.



CHARLES EDWARD

I thank you, noble Prussian.



PANGLOSS

Let us open the discussion.



SULTAN ACHMET

Yo-ho!



PANGLOSS

Sh!



TSAR IVAN

Charles Edward's plan appeals to me.

What good are pomp and riches?

Let's wash our hands of luxury

In irrigation ditches.

I'm sick of plot and counterplot;

They never fail to thicken.

Let's find a humble rustic spot,

And cultivate the chicken.



CANDIDE

Ah, what pregnant observations!



IVAN

I thank you for your patience.



HERMANN

Point of order, Mr. Chairman.



PANGLOSS

The floor is yours, King Hermann.



ACHMET

Yo-ho!



STANISLAUS

Ugh. Ugh.



PANGLOSS

Sh!



HERMANN

We kings live so unpleasantly;

Our lives are hard and lonely.

Let's form a happy peasantry

For former monarchs only.



I'll trade my kingdom for a hoe,

My scepter for a shovel,

And make the red, red roses grow

Around our happy hovel.



CANDIDE

What a very sweet suggestion!



CHARLES EDWARD

I hereby move the question.



IVAN

I second Charles's move, sirs.



PANGLOSS

Say "Aye" if you approve, sirs.



ACHMET

Yo-ho!



CHARLES EDWARD, HERMANN, IVAN,CANDIDE, PANGLOSS

Aye!



STANISLAUS

Ugh!



ALL except STANISLAUS

We have passed Charles Edward's motion,

And now if we can manage

Without excessive damage

The motion of this ocean,

We'll all say farewell

To vanity and strife

And in some dale

Pursue the Simple Life.



KINGS

Yo-ho for the Simple Life.



CANDIDE, PANGLOSS

Yo-ho.



STANISLAUS

Ugh. Ugh.
