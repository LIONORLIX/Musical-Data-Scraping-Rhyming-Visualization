Finale Act 1 (Quartet)


CANDIDE

Once again we must be gone

Moving onward to the New World!

Shall our hopes be answered there?

Is that land so good and fair?



CUNEGONDE

In that land across the sea,

When our quest at last is ended,

Then all our fortunes shall be mended:

We shall dwell there, free of every care, happy we!



OLD LADY

Stripped though we are

Of our possessions, my dear,

We shall go far Through our professions, my dear.

If this New World



Has plenty of gallants,

We'll right our balance

Using our talents, my dear.



CAPTAIN

Go now and save

Montevideo, Candide!

Faithful and brave,

Go on your way, O Candide!



You must deter The heathen invader,

Drive out the raider,

Like a crusader, Candide.



OLD LADY

I was in a funk,

My confidence was failing,

I was feeling sunk,

But once again I'm sailing!



CAPTAIN

Yes, go, Candide.

Do as I say: On your way, O Candide!

Ah!



CUNEGONDE

Farewell, Old World!

Ah!



OLD LADY

I was depressed and my spirits were failing,

All's for the best now because we are sailing!

Ah!



CANDIDE

Shall my hopes for the first time

Be answered in that New World?

Oh, farewell, Old World, farewell!

Ah!



In that land across the sea,

When our quest at last is ended

All our fortunes shall be mended.



CUNEGONDE

Though we're deprived

Of our possessions, my dear,

We have survived

Through our professions, my dear.



If the New WorldHas plenty of gallants...



OLD LADY

I was in a funk,

My confidence was failing,

I was feeling sunk,

But once again I'm sailing!



CAPTAIN

Go now and save

Montevideo, Candide!

Faithful and brave,

Go on your way, O Candide!



You must deter

The heathen invader!



CUNEGONDE, WOMEN

Farewell to the Old!

We're bound for the realms of Gold!



OLD LADY

My heart's full of hope,

I'm sure we can cope, my dear!



CANDIDE, MEN

Farewell to distress!

All hail to our happiness!



CAPTAIN

With many a deed, Candide!
