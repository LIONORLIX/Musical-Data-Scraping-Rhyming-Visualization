The Ballad of Eldorado


CANDIDE

Up a seashell mountain,

Across a primrose sea,

To a jungle fountain

High up in a tree;



Then down a primrose mountain

Across a seashell sea

To a land of happy people

Just and kind and bold and free.



CHORUS

to Eldorado, to Eldorado.



CANDIDE

They bathe each dawn in a golden lake,

Emeralds hang upon the vine.

All is there for all to take,

Food and god and books and wine.



They have no words for fear and greed,

For lies and war revenge and rage.

They sing and dance and think and read.

They live in peace and die of age.



CHORUS

in Eldorado, in Eldorado.



CANDIDE

They gave me home, they called me friend,

They taught me how to live in grace,

Seasons passed without an end

In that sweet and blessed place.



But I grew sad and could not stay;

Without my love my heart grew cold

So they sadly sent me on my way

With gracious gifts of gems and gold.



CHORUS

from Eldorado, from Eldorado.



CANDIDE

"Good-bye," they said, "We pray you

May safely cross the sea "

"Go," they said, "And may you

Find your bride to be:



'Then past the jungle fountain,

Along a silver shore

I've come by sea and mountain

To be with my love once more.



CHORUS

... from Eldorado, from Eldorado
