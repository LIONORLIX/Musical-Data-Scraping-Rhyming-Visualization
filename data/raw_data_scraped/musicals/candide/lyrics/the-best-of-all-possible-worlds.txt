CANDIDE:

There is a reason

For everything under the sun!



MAXIMILLIAN:

Objection!

What about snakes?



PANGLOSS:

Snakes!

'Twas snake that tempted mother Eve

Because of snake we now believe

That though depraved

We can be saved

From hellfire and damnation

(Because of snake's temptation!)



If snake had not seduced our lot

And primed us for salvation

Jehova could not pardon all

The sins that we call cardinal

Involving bed and bottle!



ALL

Now onto Aristotle!



PANGLOSS

Mankind is one

All men are brothers!



STUDENTS:

As you'd have done

Do unto others!



PANGLOSS

It's understood in

This best of all possible worlds--



MAXIMILLIAN

All's for the good in

This best of all possible worlds!



CANDIDE:

Objection!

What about war?



PANGLOSS:

War!

Though war may seem a bloody curse

It is a blessing in reverse

When canon roar

Both rich and poor

By danger are united!

(Till every wrong is righted!)



Philosophers make evident

The point that I have cited

'Tis war makes equal -- as it were --

The noble and the commoner

Thus war improves relations!



ALL:

Now onto conjugations!



PANGLOSS:

Amo, amas,

Amat, amamus!



STUDENTS:

Amo, amas,

Amat, amamus!



PANGLOSS:

Proving that this is

The best of all possible worlds

With love and kisses [blows a kiss]

The best of all possible worlds!

Proving that this is

The best of all possible worlds

With love and kisses [blows a kiss]

The best of all possible worlds!
