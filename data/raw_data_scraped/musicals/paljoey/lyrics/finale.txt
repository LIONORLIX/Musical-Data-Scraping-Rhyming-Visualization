Finale


Wise at last

My eyes at last

Are cutting you down to your size at last

Bewitched, bothered and bewildered no more



Burned a lot

But learned a lot

And now you are broke, though you earned a lot

Bewitched, bothered and bewildered no more



Couldn't eat

Was dyspeptic

Life was so hard to bear;

Now my heart's antiseptic

Since you moved out of there



Romance-Finis

Your chance-finis

Those ants that invaded my pants-finis

Bewitched, bothered and bewildered no more.



[Thanks to Diana for lyrics]
