What Is A Man?


There are so many, so many fish in the sea,

must I want the one who?s not for me?

It?s just my foolish way.

What can I do about it?

I much too use to love

to be without it.



What is a man?

Is he an animal

is he a wolf

is he a mouse

is he the cheap or the dear kind,

is he champagne or the beer kind?



What is a man?

Is he a stimulant

good for the heart

bad for the nerves?

Nature's mistake since the world begun.

What makes me give?

What makes me live?

What is this thing called man?



Hello Jack can't keep the appointment,

have an awful cold [sneeze].

Hello Frank

have to meet my husband.

So long, please don't scold.

Hello-Hello-love.



What is a man?

is he an ornament?

useless by day

and dear by night.

Nature's mistake since the world begun.

All have one trick

one that is slick.

What is this thing called man?
