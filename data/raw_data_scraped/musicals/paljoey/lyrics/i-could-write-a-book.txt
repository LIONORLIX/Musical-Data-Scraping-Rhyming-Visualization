I Could Write A Book


JOEY:



A-B-C-D-E-G

I never learned to spell

at least not well.

1-2-3-4-5-6-7

I never learned to count

a great amount.

But my busy mind is burning

to use what learning I've got.

I won't waste any time,

I'll strike while the iron is hot.



If they asked me, I could write a book

about the way you walk and whisper and look.

I could write a preface on how we met

so the world would never forget.

And the simple secret of the plot

is just to tell them that I love you a lot.

Then the world discovers as my book ends

how to make two lovers a friend



LINDA:



Use to hate to go to school

I never craked a book;

I pleyed the hook

Never answered any mail;

to write I used to think was wasting ink.

It was never my endeavor

to be too clever and smart.

Now I suddenly feel

a longing to write in my heart



If they asked me, I could write a book

about the way you walk and whisper and look.

I could write a preface on how we met

so the world would never forget.

And the simple secret of the plot

is just to tell them that I love you a lot.

Then the world discovers as my book ends

how to make two lovers a friend
