There's A Small Hotel


There's a small hotel

With a wishing well

I wish that we were there together

There's a bridal suite

One room bright and neat

Complete for us to share together



Looking through the window

You can see that distant steeple

Not a sign of people -- who wants people?

When the steeple bell says,

"Good night, sleep well,"

We'll thank the small hotel together



And when the steeple bell says,

"Good night, sleep well,"

We'll thank the small hotel together
