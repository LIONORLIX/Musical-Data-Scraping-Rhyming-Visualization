Chicago (A Great Big Town)


There's a great big town

On a great big lake

Called Chicago.

When the sun goes down

It is wide awake.

Take your ma and your pa,

Go to Chicago.



Boston is England

N'Orleans is France,

New York is anyone's

for ten cents a dance



But This great big town

On a great big lake

Is America's first

and Americans make

Chicago.

Hi ya boys.
