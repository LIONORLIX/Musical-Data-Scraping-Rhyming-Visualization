Zip


Zip! Walter Lippman wasn't brilliant today.

Zip! Will Saryan ever write a great play?

Zip! I was reading Schopenhauer last night.

Zip! And I think that Schopenhauer was right.

I don't want to see Zorina,

I don't want to meet Cobina.

Zip! I'm an intelectual.

I don't like a deep contralto,

Or a man whose voice is alto.

Zip! I'm a heterosexual.

Zip! It took intelect to master my art.

Zip! Who the hell is Margie Hart?



Zip! I consider Dali's painting passe.

Zip! Can they make the Metropolitan pay?

Zip! English people don't say clerk, they say clark.

Zip! Anybody who says clark is a jark!

I have read the great Cabala,

And I simply worship Allah.

Zip! I am just a mystic.

I don't care for Whistler's mother,

Charlie's aunt, or Shubert's brother.

Zip! I'm misogynistic.

Zip! My intelligence is guiding my hand.

Zip! Who the hell is Sally Rand?



Zip! Toscanini leads the greatest of bands.

Zip! Jergens Lotion does the trick for his hands.

Zip! Rip Van Winkle on the screen would be smart.

Zip! Tyrone Power will be cast in the part.

I adore the great Confucius,

And the lines of luscious Lucius.

Zip! I am so ecletic.

I don't care for either Mickey Mouse and Rooney make me sicky!

Zip! I'm a little hectic.

Zip! My artistic taste is classic and dear.

Zip! Who the hell is Lili St. Cyr?
