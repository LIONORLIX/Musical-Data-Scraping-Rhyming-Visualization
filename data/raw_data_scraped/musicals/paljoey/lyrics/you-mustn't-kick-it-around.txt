You Mustn't Kick It Around


I have the worst apprehension

That you don't crave my attention,

But I can't force you to change your taste.

If you don't care to be nice, dear,

Then give me air, but not ice, dear.

Don't let a good fellow go to waste.

For this little sin that you commit at leisure,

You'll repent in haste.

If my heart gets in your hair,

You mustn't kick it around.

If you're bored with this affair,

You mustn't kick it around.

Even though I mild and meek

When we have a brawl,

If I turn the other cheek

You mustn't kick it at all.

When I try to ring the bell,

You never care for the sound.

The next guy may not do as well,

You mustn't kick it around.
