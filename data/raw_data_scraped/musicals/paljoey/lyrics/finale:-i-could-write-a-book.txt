Finale: I Could Write a Book


If they asked me, I could write a book;

About the way you walk, and whisper;

And look.

I could write a preface;

On how we met;

That the world will never forget.



And the simple;

Secret of the plot;

Is just to tell them;

That I love you, alot.

Then the world discovers;

As my book ends;

How to make two lovers of friends.
