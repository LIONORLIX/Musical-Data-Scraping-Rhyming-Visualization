Take Him


VERSE 1



LINDA:

He was a cutie - I admit I used to care.

but it's my duty to myself to take the air.

I won't prevent you from eloping if you wish

may I present you with this tasty dish



REFRAIN 1



Take him, you don't have to pay for him

Take him, it's free

Take him, I won't make a play for him

he's not for me.

He has no head to think with

true that hi heart is asleep.

But he has eyes to wink with.

You can have him cheap.

Keep him and just for the lure of it

marry him too.

Keep him, for you can be sure of it

he can't keep you.

So take my old jalopy

Keep him from falling apart.

Take him, but don't ever take him to heart.



VERSE 2



VERA:

Thanks little mousey, for the present and all that

but in this housy, I would rather keep a rat

Only a wizard could reform that class of males

thay say a lizard can not change his scales.



REFRAIN 2



Take him, I won't put a price on him

Take him, he's yours

Take him, pajamas look nice on him.

But how he snores!

Thought he is well adjusted

Certan things make him a wreck.

Last year his arm was busted

Reaching from a check.

His thoughts are seldom consecutive

he just can't write.

I know a movie executive

who's twice as bright,

Lots of good luck, you'll need it

and you'll need aspirin, too

Take him, but don't ever lat him take you.



REFRAIN 3



BOTH:

I hope that things will go well with him;

I bear no hate.

All i can say is the hell with him

he gets the gate.

So take my benedition,

Take my old benedict, too

Take him away, it's too good to be true.
