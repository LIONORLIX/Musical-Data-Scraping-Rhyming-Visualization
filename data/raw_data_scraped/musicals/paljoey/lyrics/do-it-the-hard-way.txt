Do It The Hard Way


Fred Astaire once worked so hard he often lost his breath

And now he taps all other chaps to death

Working hard did not retard the young Cab Calloway

Now hear him blow his vo-de-o-do today



Do it the hard way and it's easy sailing

Do it the hard way and it's hard to lose

Only the soft way has a chance of failing

You have to choose



I took the hard way when I tried to get you

You took the soft way when you said, "We'll see"

Darling, now I'll let you do it the hard way

Now that you want me



Do it the hard way and it's easy sailing

Do it the hard way and it's hard to lose

Only the soft way has a chance of failing

You have to choose
