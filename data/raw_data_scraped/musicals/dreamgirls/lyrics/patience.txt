Patience


-C.C.

I know you have questions

same ones as me

How long has it been?

How long will it be?

When will come the morning

to drive the night away?

Tell me when will come the morning

of a brighter day?



(Chorus)

Patience, Little Sister

Patience, Little Brother

Patience, Patience

Take each other by the hand

Patience, Little Sisters

Patience, Little Brothers

Let us walk together

to the Promised Land



-Jimmy

There's a river to cross

And a mountain to climb

Patience, Patience

It's gonna take some time

-Lorrell

We must walk in Peace

-Jimmy

We got to walk in Peace

-Lorrell

It's the only, only way

-Jimmy

If we want to see that morning

-Jimmy

Of a Brighter Day

-Lorrell

Of a Brighter Day



(Chorus)

Patience, Little Sister

Patience, Little Brother

Patience, Patience

We're gonna find a way

Patience, Little Sisters

Patience, Little Brothers

Until that morning of a Brighter Day

Patience, Patience

'Til that Brighter Day

Patience, Patience

'Til that Brighter Day
