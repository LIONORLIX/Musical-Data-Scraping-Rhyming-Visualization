One Night Only


Effie:

You want all my love and my devotion

You want my loving soul right on the line

I have no doubt that I could love you forever

The only trouble is, you really don't have the time

You've got one night only, one night only

That's all you have to spare

One night only, let's not pretend to care

One night only, one night only

Come on big baby come on

One night only, we only have 'til dawn

In the morning this feeling will be gone

It has no chance going on

Something so right has got no chance to live

So let's forget about chances, this one night I will give

Deena and the Dreams:

You want all my love and my devotion

You want my loving soul right on the line

I have no doubt that I could love you forever

The only trouble is, I really, really don't have the time

You've got one night only, one night only

That's all I have to spare

One night only, let's not pretend to care

One night only, one night only

Come on big baby come on

One night only, we only have 'til dawn (We only have 'til dawn)

In the morning this feeling will be gone (Be gone)

It has no chance going on

Something so right has got no chance to live

So let's forget about chances, it's one night I will give

One night only, one night only

Come on big baby come on

One night only, we only have 'til dawn (Nothing but one night)

One night only, one night only

There's nothing more to say

One night only, words get in the way (Nothing but one night)

One night only, one night only...
