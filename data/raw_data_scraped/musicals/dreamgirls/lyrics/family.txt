Family


What about what I need?

Curtis says its the best thing for the group.

What about whats best for me?

He feels the Dreams can crossover.

What about how I feel?

But when we're famous I'll write great things for ya, Effie do it for me.

What about me? What about me?



It's more than you, it is more than me

No matter what we are, we are a family

This dream is for all of us, this one can be real,

and you cant stop us now because of how you feel..

It's more than you, It is more than me

Whatever dreams we have, there for the family,

we're not alone anymore now there are others there,

and that dreams big enough for all of us to share,

so dont think that your going,

your not going anywhere, your staying and taking your share, and if

you get afraid again, I'll be there..,

We are a family like a giant tree branching out towards the sky, we are a family we

are so much more than just you and I we are a family like a giant tree,

growing stronger, growing wiser, we are growing free..we need you..we are a family...
