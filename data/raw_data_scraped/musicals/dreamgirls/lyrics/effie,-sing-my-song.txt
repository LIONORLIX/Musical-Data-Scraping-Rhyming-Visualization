Effie, Sing My Song


C.c.

Effie, it's been all these years

You havent even said, "hello."

I'm your brother, effie,

Say, "hello."

Come on, effie, you know i'm sorry

I should have come before today

Hold me is all i have to say



Effie

You've always been the baby



C.c.

But i'm trying to change



Effie

And so am i



Both

It's taken all these years to be free



Effie

Of loving that man



C.c.

Finding myself



Both

And getting a hold of the anger in me



C.c

Effie, i have a song

And only you can sing it the way it should be



Effie

I've waited so long to hear you say that to me

Say it again! Say it again!



C.c.

Effie, sing my song the way it should be!
