Lorrell Loves Jimmy/Family (Reprise)


Lorrell

And lorrell loves jimmy

Lorrell loves jimmy

Lorrell loves jimmy, it?s true

But lorrell and jimmy are through

I got a show to do, remember, baby?

Oh, baby, i got a show to do

Deena, lorrell, michelle

We are a family

Like a giant tree

Branching out towards the sky

We are a family

We are so much more

More than just you and i

We are growing free
