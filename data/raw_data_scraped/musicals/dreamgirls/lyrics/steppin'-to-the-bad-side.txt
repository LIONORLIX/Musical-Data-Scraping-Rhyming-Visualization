Steppin to the bad side(Dreamettes: Today)



[James Thunder Early]

Yea-ee-yea, Man just stole my woman from me

Took her down to Tennessee

She was the best girl I ever knew

If it wasnt for him, she'd still be true

I've always been a good man, its been said

Damnit, that man, he wish you were dead

Men like him make good men mad

Starting today Im gonna be bad, yeah, yeah, yeah
