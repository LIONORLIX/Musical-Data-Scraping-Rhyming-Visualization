Hard To Say Goodbye


We didn't make forever.

We each got to go our seperate way,

And now we're standing here, helpless,

Looking for something to say.

We've been together a long time.

We never thought it would end.

We were always so close to each other;

You were always my friend.



And it's hard to say good-bye, my love.

Hard to see you cry, my love.

Hard to open up that door.

You're not sure what you're going for.



I didn't want this to happen,

But we shouldn't feel sad.

We had a good life together.

Just remember, remember, all the times we had.

It's not that I don't love you deeply

You were my family

It's just that I'm feeling there's so much more

Waiting out there for you and me.



And it's hard to say good-bye, my love.

Hard to see you cry, my love.

Hard to open up that door.

You're not sure what you're going for.



You'll know I'll always love you.

You'll know I'll always care.

And no matter how far I may go,

In my thoughts,

You'll always be there.



(It's so hard) hard to say good-bye, my love.

(Baby, it's hard) hard to see you cry, my love.

(It's hard) hard to open up that door,

When you're not sure what you're going for.



(It's so hard.)

Good-bye my love.

(Baby, it's so hard.)

We didn't make forever.

It's so hard.

I can feel there's something more.

(When you're not sure what you're going for.)

We've got to work it,

We've got to try,

Though it's hard, so hard

We have to say good-bye

Though it's hard, so hard

We have to say

We didn't make forever.

How could we loose tomorrow?

We didn't make forever.

How could we loose tomorrow?
