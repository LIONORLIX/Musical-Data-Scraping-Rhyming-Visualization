Dreamgirls (Finale)


Effie

Every man has his own special dream

And that dream`s just about to come true

Life`s not as bad as it may seem

If you open your eyes to

What`s in front of you

Effie, deena, lorrell, michelle

We`re your dream girls

Boys, we`ll make you happy

We`re your dream girls

Boys, we`ll always care

We`re your dream girls

Dream girls will never leave you

And all you got to do is dream

All you got to do is dream

All you got to do is dream

Just dream, and baby, we`ll be there!

We`ll be there!
