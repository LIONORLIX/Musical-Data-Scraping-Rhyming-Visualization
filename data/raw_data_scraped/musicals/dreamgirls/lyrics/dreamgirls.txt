Dreamgirls


DEENA:

Every man has his own special dream, and your dreams' just about to come true.

Life's not as bad as it may seem if you

open your eyes to what's in front of you.



DREAMS: We're your dreamgirls



DEENA:Boys we'll make ya happy...yeah!



DREAMS:We're your dreamgirls



DEENA:Boys, we'll always care



DREAMS:We're your dreamgirls, dreamgirls will never leave you.



DEENA-No,no and all you've got to do is dream, baby...



DREAMS-We'll be there. Dreams!



DEENA-Dreamgirls will help you through the night!

DEENA-Dreamgirls will make you feel all right.



LORELL-Dreamgirls keep you dreaming your whole life through.



EFFIE-Yes dreamgirls can make your dreams come true.
