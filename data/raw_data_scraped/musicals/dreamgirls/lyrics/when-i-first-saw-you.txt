When I First Saw You


**Jamie Foxx Version**



[Verse]

When I first saw you

I said "O My", I said "O My"

That's a dream

That's my dream

I needed a dream

When it all seemed to go bad

Then I found you

And I have had the most beautiful dreams any mans ever had



[Verse 2]

When I first saw you

I said "O My", "O My"

That's my dream

That's my dream

I needed a dream

To make me strong

You were the only reason I had to go on



[Chorus]

You were my dream

All the things I never knew

You were my dream

Who could believe they could ever come true

And who would believe

The world would believe

And my dreams too



[Verse 3]

When I first saw you

I said "O My", "O My"

That's my dream



[Fade Out]

**Jamie Foxx and Beyonce Knowles Duet Version**



[Verse]

{Jamie}

When I first saw you

I said "O My"

That's my dream, that's my dream

O, I need a dream when it all seemed to go bad

Then I find you

And I have had the most beautiful dreams any mans ever had

{Beyonce}

When I first saw you

I said "O My"

That's my dream, that's my dream

I needed a dream to make me strong

You were the only reason I had to go on



[Chorus]

You were my dream

All of the things that I've never knew

You were my dream

Who could believe they would ever come true

And who would believe

The world would believe

In my dreams too



[Bridge]

{Jamie}

Before you appeared

My life was only a game

And day in

And day out

Were the same Oh

{Beyonce}

Now dreams

{Jamie}

The dreams

{Beyonce}

Coming true

{Jamie}

Coming True

{Beyonce}

Like a star

{Jamie}

Like a star

{Beyonce}

See It shine

{Together}

A dream

{Beyonce}

That is yours

{Jamie}

That is yours

{Beyonce}

That is mine

{Jamie}

That is mine

{Jamie}

You were my dream

{Beyonce}

Now I've got dreams of my own

{Jamie}

All the things I could never be

{Beyonce}

Dreams you've never known

{Together}

You won't take my dream from me



[Verse 2]

{Jamie}

When I first saw you Oh

{Beyonce}

I said "O My"

{Jamie}

I said "O My"

{Together}

That's my dream
