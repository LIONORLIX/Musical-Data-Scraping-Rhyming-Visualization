Love You I Do


Never met a man

Quite like you

Doing all he can

Making my dreams come true



You’re strong and you’re smart

You've taken my heart

And I give you the rest of me too



You’re the perfect man for me

I love you I do



Mm I love ya



Never ever felt

Quite like this

Good about myself

From our very first kiss

I’m here when you call

you’ve got it all

And confidence like I never knew



You’re the perfect man for me

I love you I do



You've got the charm

You simply disarm me every time

As long as you drive

I’m along for the ride

Your way

You said it before

There wont be a door

that’s closed to us

Putting all my trust in you

Cause you, you’ll always be true, Oh



I never could have known

This would be,

Oh you and you alone

All for me

I know you’re the best

You passed every test

Its almost too good to be true



You’re the perfect man for me

I love you I do



You’re the perfect man for me

I love you I do
