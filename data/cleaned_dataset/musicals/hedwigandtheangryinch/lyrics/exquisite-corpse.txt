------ Exquisite Corpse ------
--- Unknown ---
Oh God
I'm all sewn up
A hardened razor-cut
Scar map across my body
And you can trace the lines
Through Misery's design
That map across my body
--- Unknown ---
A collage
All sewn up
A montage
All sewn up
--- Unknown ---
A random pattern with a needle and thread
The overlapping way diseases are spread
Through a tornado body
With a hand grenade head
And the legs are two lovers entwined
--- Unknown ---
Inside I'm hollowed out
Outside's a paper shroud
And all the rest's illusion
That there's a will and soul
That we can wrest control
From chaos and confusion
--- Unknown ---
A collage
All sewn up
A montage
All sewn up
--- Unknown ---
The automatist's undoing
The whole world starts unscrewing
As time collapses and space warps
You see decay and ruin
I tell you No, no no no
You make such an exquisite corpse
--- Unknown ---
I've got it all sewn up
A hardened razor-cut
Scar map across my body
And you can trace the lines
Through Misery's design
That map across my body
--- Unknown ---
A collage
All sewn up
A montage
