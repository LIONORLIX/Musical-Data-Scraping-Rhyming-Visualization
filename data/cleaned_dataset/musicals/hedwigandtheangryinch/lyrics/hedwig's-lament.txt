------ Hedwig's Lament ------
--- Unknown ---
I was born on the other side
of a town ripped in two
And no matter how hard I've tried
I end up black and blue
--- Unknown ---
I rose from off of the doctor's slab
I lost a piece of my heart
Now everyone gets to take a stab
They cut me up into parts
--- Unknown ---
I gave a piece to my mother
I gave a piece to my man
I gave a piece to the rock star
