------ Wicked Little Town (Reprise) ------
--- Unknown ---
Forgive me,
For I did not know.
'Cause I was just a boy
And you were so much more
--- Unknown ---
Than any god could ever plan,
More than a woman or a man.
And now I understand how much I took from you:
That, when everything starts breaking down,
You take the pieces off the ground
And show this wicked town
something beautiful and new.
--- Unknown ---
You think that Luck
Has left you there.
But maybe there's nothing
up in the sky but air.
--- Unknown ---
And there's no mystical design,
No cosmic lover preassigned.
There's nothing you can find
that can not be found.
'Cause with all the changes
you've been through
It seems the stranger's always you.
Alone again in some new
Wicked little town.
--- Unknown ---
So when you've got no other choice
You know you can follow my voice
Through the dark turns and noise
Of this wicked little town.
Oh it's a wicked, little town.
