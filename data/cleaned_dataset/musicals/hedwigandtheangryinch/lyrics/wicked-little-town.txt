------ Wicked Little Town ------
--- Unknown ---
You know, the sun is in your eyes
And hurricanes and rains
and black and cloudy skies.
--- Unknown ---
You're running up and down that hill.
You turn it on and off at will.
There's nothing here to thrill
or bring you down.
And if you've got no other choice
You know you can follow my voice
through the dark turns and noise
of this wicked little town.
--- Unknown ---
Oh Lady, luck has led you here
and they're so twisted up
they'll twist you up. I fear.
--- Unknown ---
the pious, hateful and devout,
you're turning tricks til you're turned out,
the wind so cold it burns,
you're burning out and blowing round.
And if you've got no other choice
you know you can follow my voice
through the dark turns and noise
of this wicked little town.
--- Unknown ---
The fates are vicious and they're cruel.
You learn too late you've used two wishes
like a fool
--- Unknown ---
and then you're someone you are not,
and Junction City ain't the spot,
remember Mrs. Lot
and when she turned around.
And if you've got no other choice
You know you can follow my voice
through the dark turns and noise
