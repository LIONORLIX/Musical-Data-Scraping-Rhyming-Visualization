Random Number Generation
all our feelings and thoughts
expressed in ones and in oughts
in endless spiraling chains
you can't decode or explain
cause you are so analog
god dog I eye I god dog
--- Unknown ---
we're the random number generation
we are random number generated
we are random numbers
--- Unknown ---
in the regime of the solid state
wheels spin when you iterate
k is x squared minus one
but .54321
when x is taken times two
that's when we're coming for you
--- Unknown ---
we're the random number generation
we are random number generated
we are random numbers
--- Unknown ---
Mister Little started something huge
Iggy Pop Iggy Stooge
all the children shout out,
hey here we are
--- Unknown ---
we're the random number generation
we are random number generated
