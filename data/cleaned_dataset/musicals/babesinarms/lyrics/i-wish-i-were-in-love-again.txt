------ I Wish I Were In Love Again ------
--- VERSE ---
--- Unknown ---
You don't know that I felt good
when we up and parted.
You don't know I knocked on wood
gladly broken-hearted.
Worrying is trought,
I sleep all night
appetite and health restored.
You don't know how muck I'm bored!

REFRAIN 1
--- Unknown ---
The sleepless nights,
the daily fights
the qick toboggan when you reach the heights
I miss the kisses and I miss the bites
I wish I were in love again!
--- Unknown ---
The broken dates,
the endless waits,
the lovely loving and the hateful hates,
the conversations with the flying plates
I wish I were in love again!
--- Unknown ---
No more pain
no more strain
now I'm sane but ...
I would rather be gaga!
The pulled-out fur
of cat and cur
the fine mismating of a him and her
I've learned my lesson, but I wish I were
in love again!
--- Unknown ---
REFRAIN 2
The furtive sight
the blackened eye,
the words I'll love you till the day I day
the self-deception the belives the lie
I wish I were in love again!
--- Unknown ---
When love congeals
it soon reveals
the faint aroma of performing seals
the double-crossong ps a pair of heels.
I wish I were in love again!
--- Unknown ---
No more care
no despair
I'm all there now
But I'd rather be punch-drunk!
Belive me sir
I much prefer
the classic battle of a him and her.
I don't like quiet and
