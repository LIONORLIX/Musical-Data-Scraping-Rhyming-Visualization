------ Johnny One-Note ------
--- Unknown ---
Johnny could only sing one note
And the note he sings was this
Ah!
--- Unknown ---
Poor Johnny one-note
sang out with gusto
And just overlorded the place
Poor Johnny one-note
yelled willy nilly
Until he was bleu in the face
For holding one note was his ace
--- Unknown ---
Couldn?t hear the brass
Couldn?t hear the drum
He was in a class
By himself, by gum!
--- Unknown ---
Poor Johnny one-note
Got in Aida
Indeed a great chance to be brave
He took his one note
Howled like the North Wind
Brought forth wind that made critics rave,
While Verdi turned round in his grave!
--- Unknown ---
Couldn?t hear the flute
Or the big trombone
Ev?ry one was mute
Johnny stood alone.
--- Unknown ---
Cats and dogs stopped yapping
Lions in the zoo
All were jealous of Johnny's big trill
Thunder claps stopped clapping,
Traffic ceased its roar,
And they tell us Niag?ra stood still.
He stopped the train whistles,
Boat whistles,
steam whistles,
Cop whistles,
all whistles bowed to his skill
--- Unknown ---
Sing Johnny One-Note,
Sing out with gusto and
Just overwhelm all the crowd
Ah!
So sing Johnny One-Note, out loud!!
Sing Johnny One-Note
