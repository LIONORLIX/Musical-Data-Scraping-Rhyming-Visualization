------ My Funny Valentine ------
--- Unknown ---
Be hold the way our fine feathered-friend
his virtue doth parade.
Thou knowest not my dim witted friend,
the picture Thou hast made.
Thy vacant brow and Thy tousled hair
conceal Thy good intent.
Thou noble upright, truthful, sincere
And slightly dopey gent- you are..

My funny valentine
Sweet comic valentine
You make me smile with my heart
--- Unknown ---
You looks are laughable, unphotographable
Yet you're my favorite work of art
--- Unknown ---
Is your figure less than greek
Is your mouth a little bit weak
When you open it to speak, are you smart?
--- Unknown ---
Don't change your hair for me
Not if you care for me
Stay little valentine stay
