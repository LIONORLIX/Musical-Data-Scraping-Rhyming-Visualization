------ Marie's Law ------
--- Marie ---
My law
shall state
To whom
it may concern:
When a lady loves a gentleman, he must love her in return.
In re:
my law;
ad hoc,
to wit, to woo:
When a lady feels affectionate, then the man must follow through.
Here's another law we women'll do our best to legislate:
It shall be completely criminal for a man to break a date. Each offender shall be rapidly thrown in jail where he belongs.
Thus we'll write our Bill of Wrongs.
My law
is what
the world
is waiting for.
Every unrequited lover will be grateful when it
meets the full approval of the House and Senate,
Such enthusiasm as you never saw will greet my lovely law!
In re: my law;
it should
be understood:
with the help of women everywhere we shall outlaw bachelorhood!
What's more, in lieu...
Morris:
Marie, before you're through, I've got
some things
I'd like
to say; if you have got to outlaw anything
you should outlaw in-laws, too!
Marie:
I'm concerned with what the man must do.
Every girl shall have a honeymoon
which shall last at least a year.
During which aforesaid honeymoon
every care shall disappear.
Ipso facto, let the government
get the bride and groom alone.
After that they're on their own.
Whereas (whereat)
hereby (hereof)
herein (there-out, and furthermore)
My law
is what
the world
is waiting for.
We are going to rid the country of contempt of courtship,
Legally replacing it with davenportship
