------ Till Tomorrow ------
--- Unknown ---
Twilight descends, everything ends
'til tomorrow, tomorrow.
If we must part, here is my heart,
'til tomorrow, tomorrow.
--- Unknown ---
Love drifting by, echoes a sigh, parting is such sweet sorrow.
--- Unknown ---
I'm drifting too, dreaming of you,'til tomorrow comes.
