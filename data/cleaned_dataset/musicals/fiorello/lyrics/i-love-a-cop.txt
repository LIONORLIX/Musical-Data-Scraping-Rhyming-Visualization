------ I Love A Cop ------
--- Unknown ---
"Oh, gosh, life is so complicated"
I love a cop
I love a cop
--- Unknown ---
What a situation! Ain't it awful?
Life is really grim
I can only say that it's unlawful
How I feel towards him!
--- Unknown ---
I love a cop
I love a cop
--- Unknown ---
If I introduce him as my steady
Down at where I work
I can hear the rumors spread already
Dora's gone berserk
--- Unknown ---
Then there's Thea -- Oh, how gruesome
Can you see me introduce him?
You remember her -- she detested you
You remember him -- he arrested you
--- Unknown ---
I'm so confused
I'm so confused
If I loved a dentist or a doctor
I'd be up on top
But I love a cop
--- Unknown ---
I love a cop
I love a cop
--- Unknown ---
Though it wasn't easy to accept him
Now I think he's sweet
You should hear him tell the way I swept him
Off his big flat feet
--- Unknown ---
I love a cop
I love a cop
--- Unknown ---
I can see his drawbacks clear as crystal
Still, I testify
Once you take away his club and pistol
Floyd won't hurt a fly
--- Unknown ---
Floyd's ambitious and he's forceful
Energetic and resourceful
I can see how far this will carry him
If he'd get an honest job, I would marry him
--- Unknown ---
That's how it is
He's mine; I'm his
Little did I know when Floyd first kissed me
And I whispered, Stop
You can't stop a cop
