------ The Very Next Man ------
--- Unknown ---
I shall marry the very next man who asks me
You'll see
Next time I feel
That a man's about to kneel
He won't have to plead or implore
I'll say Yes before his knee hits the floor
--- Unknown ---
No more waiting around
No more browsing through True Romance
I see the light
So, while there's a chance
I'm gonna marry the very next man who asks me
--- Unknown ---
Start rehearsing the choir
Tie some shoes on my Chevrolet
Pelt me with rice
And catch my bouquet
I'm gonna marry the very next man
--- Unknown ---
If he adores me
What does it matter if he bores me?
If I allow the man to carry me off
No more will people try to marry me off
--- Unknown ---
No more living alone
No more cheating at solitaire
Holding my breath
For one special man
Why, I could smother for all he care
I'm through being wary
I'll marry the very next man
--- Unknown ---
No more daydreams for me
Find the finest of bridal suites
Chill the champagne
And warm up the sheets
I'm gonna marry the very next man
--- Unknown ---
And if he likes me
Who cares how frequently he strikes me?
I'll fetch his slippers with my arm in a sling
Just for the privilege of wearing his ring*

New York papers, take note
Here's a statement that you can quote
Waiting for ships
That never come in
A girl is likely to miss the boat
I'm through being wary
