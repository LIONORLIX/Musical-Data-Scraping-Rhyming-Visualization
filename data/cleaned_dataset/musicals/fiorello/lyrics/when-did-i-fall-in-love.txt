------ When Did I Fall In Love ------
--- Unknown ---
There he goes, my congressman!
Starting his day, hurrying right
to a fight!
There he goes, Sir Galahad!
galloping off, riding his white
Willys-Knight!
Out of the house ten seconds, and I miss him.
I miss him more, with each good-bye.
Out of the house ten seconds, and I miss him.
And no one's more astonished than I.
I never once pretended that I loved him.
When did it start, this change of heart?
When did I fall in love?
What night? What day?
When did I first begin
To feel this way?
How could the moment pass?
Unfelt? Ignored?
Where was the blinding flash,
Where was the crashing chord?
When did I fall in love?
I can`t recall,
Not that it matters at all.
It doesn`t matter when
Or why, or how,
As long as I love him now.
When did respect first become affection?
When did affection suddenly soar?
What a strange and beautiful touch
That I love him so much
When I didnâ€™t before...
When did I fall in love?
What night? What day?
When did I first begin
To feel this way?
How could the moment pass?
Unfelt? Ignored?
Where was the blinding flash,
Where was the crashing chord?
When did I fall in love?
I can`t recall,
Not that it matters at all.
I`m where I want to be,
His love, his wife
