Attention Skaters, please clear the rink while the ice is resurfaced
Thank you for your patience
--- DELIA, MARTIN, TERESA & AARON ---
It's Saturday night at Skater Planet
The Zamboni's on the ice
So we hang around here waiting
All the action's at the mall
But we'd rather be here skating
--- SETH ---
The action's at the mall
--- DELIA, MARTIN, TERESA & AARON ---
But we'd rather be here skating
Ah-ah
In New Jersey
Uh-oh uh-oh uh-o-o-oh uh-o-oh
Uh-oh uh-oh uh-o-o-oh uh-o-oh

It's Saturday night in Bergan Country
There are parties everywhere
But we never get invited
--- MARTIN ---
And I'm with the one I love
AARON:
I'm with the one I love
--- DELIA ---
I'm with the one I love
--- TERESA ---
I'm with the one I love
--- DELIA, MARTIN, TERESA & AARON ---
But my love goes unrequited
I'm with the one I love
But my love goes unrequited
Ahh ahh ahh
Nothing's right
Nothing is what it should be
--- SETH ---
Shoes are stinky, pay's not great
Skating's free but I can't skate
Cause my ankles tend to roll
In New Jersey
--- DELIA, MARTIN, TERESA & AARON ---
Uh-oh uh-oh uh-o-o-oh uh-o-oh
Uh-oh uh-oh uh-o-o-oh uh-o-oh

It's Saturday night in Butt crack township
On a road without a sign
In a town where there's not much in
Forty minutes east of hope
Forty miles from Metuchen
--- DELIA, MARTIN, TERESA & AARON ---
I'm with the one I love
--- KIM ---
It's Saturday night and I'm the new girl so I get to start from scratch
Next to Lodi this is dreamy
Sure tonight I'm getting looks
But tomorrow they might see me
--- DELIA, MARTIN, TERESA & AARON ---
I'm always getting looks
--- ALL KIDS ---
They never really see me
--- AARON ---
In New Jersey
--- MARTIN ---
In New Jersey
DELIA & TERESA:
In New Jersey
--- DELIA, MARTIN, TERESA & AARON ---
Nothing's right
Nothing is what it should be
--- AARON ---
I'm too awkward
--- DELIA ---
I'm too bright
--- MARTIN ---
I'm too anxious
--- TERESA ---
I'm too polite
--- DELIA, MARTIN, TERESA & AARON ---
We're too chipper, we're too loud
We don't blend into a crowd
We're too weird in every way
--- SETH ---
I think Springsteen's just okay
--- DELIA, MARTIN, TERESA & AARON ---
Which is not a thing to think in New Jersey
At least we have the rink in New Jersey
Ah-ah
Uh-oh uh-oh uh-o-o-oh uh-o-oh
