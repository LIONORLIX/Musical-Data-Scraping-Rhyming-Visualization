------ Good Kid ------
--- SETH ---
My brother played with nunchucks
I liked playing chess
My brother broke the knick-knacks
I would clean the mess
I ate my peas and carrots
My brother never would
And as my mother died
I promised to be good
--- Unknown ---
The good kid, the good boy, the good one
The bookworm, the Boy Scout, the good son
What has it gotten me, being good?
What has it gotten me?
--- Unknown ---
My father smokes in silence
And paces in the yard
My brother goes to rehab
I study twice as hard
--- Unknown ---
The good kid, th? good boy, the good one
The unseen, th? unheard, the good son
What has it gotten me, being good?
--- Unknown ---
Maybe a little bad
Could do a lot of good
Consider Frodo Baggins
Consider Robin Hood
The good kid, the good boy, the good one
The wrong thing, the right choice, in the long run
What has it gotten me, being good?
What has it gotten me, being good?
