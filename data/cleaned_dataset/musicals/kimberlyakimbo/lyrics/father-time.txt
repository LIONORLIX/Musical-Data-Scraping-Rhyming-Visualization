Father Time
Slow down the day
Don't let the dark come and
Steal it away
For goodness sake
We're still awake
And baby wants to play

Father Time
Hold back the night
Please let the sun stay and
We'll be alright
Tell?the?man?in the moon
It's?much too soon
To?be turning out the light
--- Unknown ---
Baby's eyes are heavy now
Baby's breath is deep
Mommy wants to baby her
Baby wants to sleep
--- Unknown ---
Father Time
Are you there?
Maybe tomorrow you'll have
Time to spare
And so I pray
For another day
--- Unknown ---
Baby's ?yes are heavy now
Baby's br?ath is deep
Mommy wants to baby her
Baby wants to sleep

Father Time
Are you there?
Maybe tomorrow you'll have
Time to spare
And so I pray
For another day
--- Unknown ---
Father, hear my prayer
Father, hear my prayer
