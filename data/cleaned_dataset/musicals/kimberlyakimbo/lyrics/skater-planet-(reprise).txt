------ Skater Planet (Reprise) ------
--- Intro ---
What if we get caught?
Who cares? It's not like any of this counts
Last Uno hand?before?Bio, I'm dealing,?everyone in
What do you mean none?of this counts?
I mean, high school, this town, it's not even real life
It's just the crap you have to get through before you get to the good part
And what's the good part?
Um, the rest of our lives
--- Verse ---
It's another day in purgatory, I'm just counting down the days
To a future that's uncharted, sure the road ahead is bright
But we haven't even started, the road ahead is bright
We're just waiting to get started
--- Interlude ---
Reverse
Reverse back to you
Uno!
--- Verse 2 ---
Someday college (MIT)
Write a novel (Law degree)
Flat in London (Job in Rome)
Perfect marriage, happy home
We just swear we'll never be in New Jersey
--- Refrain ---
La-la, la-la, la-la
La-la, la-la, la-la, la-la-la
--- Outro ---
Kim
Huh?
Blue 5 to you
Oh, sorry
I'm out!
