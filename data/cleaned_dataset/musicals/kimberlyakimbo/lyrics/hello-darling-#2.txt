------ Hello Darling #2 ------
--- PATTIE ---
Hello Darling
It's me your mother
Another rough night
You're fathers out cold on the floor
Your Aunt Debra is up to no good
And you refuse to sleep
Kim was like you
She'd never settle down unless I sang her special song
It's been so long
I'm not even sure I remember
