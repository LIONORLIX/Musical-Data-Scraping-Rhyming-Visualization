Hello, Baby
It's me, your daddy
Pattie will be mad I used the camera
I need distraction
I'm not drinking
I promised Kim I wouldn't
--- Unknown ---
(spoken)
See that?
--- Unknown ---
(singing)
I'm a good guy
I don't know what Pattie's been telling you
But you should know
I'm a good guy
--- Unknown ---
(spoken)
So
--- Unknown ---
(singing)
I guess you're coming
Another baby
--- Unknown ---
(spoken)
Huh
--- Unknown ---
(singing)
You know what's funny?
I never pictured myself a father
--- Unknown ---
(spoken)
I mean, I like kids. I'm just more of a bachelor uncle type
I mean, I don't regret it, I just
When you're young, you imagine yourself doing things, just
--- Unknown ---
(singing)
Crazy unrealistic stuff
I used to think I might live in Spain
I'm not sure why
The bulls, maybe Pamplona
Guys running in streets getting gor?d
That looked cool
Plus I had a band in high school
I don't think it would've gone anywh?re, but
You never know
--- Unknown ---
But then
Pattie got pregnant with Kim
And I was like
Well okay, I guess I'll do this then
Which was fine
It made things easier in some ways
To not have choices I mean
Most guys are
Just guys who go to work
Guys with kids and medical bills
There's no shame in that
Just being a regular person
--- Unknown ---
Still
Do the stupid stuff, baby
You have your whole life to settle down
Keep your options open
For as long as you can
And see the world
See the world
See the world
