------ Hello, Darling ------
--- PATTIE ---
Hello darling
It's me, your mother
You're in my belly right now
And sometimes you kick me
Isn't that precious?
Isn't that precious?
Hey, guess what
I have no hands!
--- Unknown ---
(spoken)
Just kidding
--- Unknown ---
(singing)
I have hands but I just can't use them
Not yet at least
But just soon as the stitches heal
I had carpal tunnel
Both hands
--- Unknown ---
All those years in Lodi took their toll
Sixteen years I worked in the Sunshine cupcake factory
Pumping cream into those ding-dong knock-offs
Sixteen years of
Squeezing, squeezing, squeezing that god-damn cream gun
I should sue
I should sue
I tried actually but they said I made the whole thing up
How crazy is that?
Why would I get operations on both hands
If I did not need them?
--- Unknown ---
Anyway, darling
I have things to tell you
And this video may be the only way to do it
Because, well
There's a high probability that I might be dead soon!
--- Unknown ---
So I won't be around when you're growing up
And this video is the only way for you to know who I was
And I want you to know who I was because
People are going to tell you things about me that just aren't true
Just aren't true
Just aren't true!
--- Unknown ---
But darling
You have to defend me
You have to tell them that I was a lovely person
Caring and thoughtful
And funny
And that you have the tapes to prove it!
--- Unknown ---
(whispered)
It's them
--- Unknown ---
(singing)
The ones who are going to tell you lies about me
Don't believe a word they say
Not a word
