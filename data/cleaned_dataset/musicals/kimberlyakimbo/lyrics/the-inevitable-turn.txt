------ The Inevitable Turn ------
--- PATTI ---
Isn’t this nice? Everybody’s being so nice
Nothing is wrong, trouble’s half passed
Everybody civil and getting along
Will it last?
--- KIM, spoken ---
You should open a restaurant, dad!
--- BUDDY, spoken ---
Maybe I will
--- DEBRA ---
No matter how well things are going
It always takes a turn
--- BUDDY ---
No matter how happy we seem
There’s always a turn
--- PATTI & DEBRA ---
Just below the pleasant chatter, we’re aware
Of a steady burn that’ll flair
We push it down
--- PATTI, BUDDY & DEBRA ---
But then we take the turn
We always take the turn
The inevitable turn
--- KIM, spoken ---
Roll?
--- PATTI, BUDDY & DEBRA ---
We fight against the turn
We struggle with th? turn
The inevitable turn
--- BUDDY, spoken ---
H?y, Debra
If you’re looking for work, they’re hiring at Costco
I hear the pay is not bad
--- DEBRA, spoken ---
Huh, I should look into that
Thanks for thinking of me, Buddy
--- BUDDY, spoken ---
Any time
--- PATTI ---
Isn’t this sweet? Everybody’s being so sweet
Look at us swerve, all on our guard
Everybody’s hoping not to take the curve
We’re trying so hard
[BUDDY, spoken]
And if you do get a job, you can finally pay me back
--- DEBRA ---
No matter how lovely the evening
It always takes a turn
No matter how careful we are
There’s always a turn
--- PATTI, BUDDY & DEBRA ---
And despite the friendly banter, we’re annoyed
By a topic we should learn to avoid
We never do
--- PATTI, BUDDY, DEBRA & (SHOWCHOIR) ---
Instead we take the turn (We take)
Of course we take the turn (We take)
The inevitable turn
--- DEBRA, spoken ---
So when you say pay you back…
--- PATTI, spoken ---
Debra!
--- BUDDY, spoken ---
I meant for the stereo you stole
[DEBRA, spoken]
Stole? You agreed to give me that stereo
--- PATTI, spoken ---
You guys!
--- BUDDY ---
It’s all going fine, then it changes so fast
A look, a joke, a slight from the past
Which will burn
Pass the salt, sling the mud
Carve the meat, draw the blood
--- DEBRA, spoken ---
We had a deal, Buddy
--- BUDDY ---
Take the turn
--- DEBRA, spoken ---
You promised to give me that stereo
If I went next door and slapped Swicky around
--- BUDDY, spoken ---
Debra!
--- Unknown ---
The Showchoir begins to sing ooh’s underneath the dialogue
--- PATTI, spoken ---
Wait, what?
--- DEBRA, spoken ---
Which I went to do! It’s not my fault it didn’t happen!
--- KIM, spoken ---
You hired Debra to beat up Mr. Swicky?
--- BUDDY, spoken ---
Well I couldn’t do it myself, he’s my neighbor!
--- KIM, spoken ---
This is exactly what I don’t wanna know!
--- BUDDY, spoken ---
He did some awful things, Kim
--- DEBRA, spoken ---
It wasn’t just him
--- BUDDY, spoken ---
Ms. Denton said she saw a masked intruder crawl in his window
Did you wear a mask?
--- DEBRA, spoken ---
Yes, a pig mask
--- BUDDY, spoken ---
A pig mask?
--- DEBRA, spoken ---
I didn’t wanna be identified and you told me to scare him
--- BUDDY, spoken ---
I didn’t tell you to kill him!
--- DEBRA, spoken ---
I didn’t know he had a weak heart!
He just took one look at me and dropped dead!
--- BUDDY, spoken ---
You were wearing a pig mask!
If a pig lady crawled in my window, I’d drop dead too!
--- KIM, spoken ---
That’s why we left Lodi, because you stared Swicky to death?
--- Unknown ---
The showchoir stops singing
--- PATTI, spoken ---
I should’ve never told you!
None of this would’ve even happened, Buddy
If you had never known
--- KIM, spoken ---
Known what?
--- PATTI, spoken ---
I really wanted another baby
--- BUDDY, spoken ---
Patti…
--- PATTI, spoken ---
But I was scared
--- BUDDY, spoken ---
She doesn’t wanna know
--- KIM, spoken ---
Scared it would be like me?
--- DEBRA, spoken ---
So she made sure it wouldn’t be
--- KIM, spoken ---
You had sex with Mr. Swicky
So dad hired Aunt Debra to beat him up
But Aunt Debra killed him instead
What is wrong with you people?!
--- Unknown ---
The adults all break out into an argument as Kim slowly leaves the table
--- SHOWCHOIR ---
No matter how well things are going
It always takes
No matter how happy we seem
There’s always
With just a blow of the wind
With a steady burn, with a steady burn
Oh!
We take the turn
Oh, we take the turn
--- BUDDY, spoken ---
Do you ever stop?!
--- DEBRA, spoken ---
Kim?
--- PATTI, spoken ---
Oh my God
--- BUDDY, spoken ---
What’s happening?
--- PATTI, spoken ---
Buddy, help her!
--- BUDDY, spoken ---
