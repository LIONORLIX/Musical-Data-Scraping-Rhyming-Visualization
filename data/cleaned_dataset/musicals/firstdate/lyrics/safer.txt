------ Safer ------
--- Casey ---
I know that I have issues.
I face them, I swear.
Think I overcome them then turn - they're still there.
--- Unknown ---
Wish that I was different.
I'd like to let go,
But when I try to change there's my past, saying no.
--- Unknown ---
Maybe it's all cause of dad,
his new kids, his new wife.
Or why not just blame mom who's been nuts my whole life.....
--- Unknown ---
When you felt so alone from the moment of birth
and you've struggled to find your own true sense of worth
When it seems that there's no one across this whole earth to depend upon, you carry on.
--- Unknown ---
Just like you always do.
Cause it's Safer
to rely on you.
Oh, it's Safer to rely on you...
--- Unknown ---
Seen a million movies all selling true love.
Fantasies I'm not sure that I'm worthy of
Caution to the wind, my heart's been on display
Still the end result is it's not gone my way
--- Unknown ---
So when I date some new guy
who's a deadbeat or jerk
At least I'm not so crushed
when it all doesn't work.....
--- Unknown ---
When you once, unafraid,
wore your heart on your sleeve
And the ones that you loved chose to just turn and leave
Every day it gets harder to somehow believe
You will survive, so you strive
--- Unknown ---
Just to keep up your guard,
Cause it's Safer
to hold every card.
Oh, it's Safer to hold every card...
--- Unknown ---
I feel out of control,
I feel safe on the ground.
I go building up walls,
yet I wish to be found
--- Unknown ---
A true contradiction to which I am bound
As I keep on spinning around and around_
And I look at the people who've worked it all out
and I wonder why I'm still a bundle of doubt
and sometimes I wanna just stand up and shout
--- Unknown ---
Just commit and deal with it
Before your life flies by...
Don't let your life fly by.....
--- Unknown ---
But is it Safer?
Maybe it's Safer,
