------ In Love With You ------
--- AARON ---
I never knew what love was like
Until I saw your face
And suddenly I felt a love
That time could not erase
--- Unknown ---
Your eyes so sweet and piercing
Your manner kind yet strong
The kind of girl I could love forever
We'd spend the rest of our lives together
And in my life I don't think I've ever
Been so fucking wrong
--- Unknown ---
You're a bitch with no heart
You're a lier, you are Satan
And I hate the way you snore at night
All your quirks piss me off
And I don't think I'm mistaking
Your compulsive need to
Always be right
--- Unknown ---
You're bossy and judgmental
Kind of tactless, boring too
And I really can't believe I ever
Fell in love with you
--- Unknown ---
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
--- Unknown ---
I know that all seemed kind of harsh
And things weren't always bad
In fact I think some times we shared
Were the best that I've ever had
--- Unknown ---
Like our road trip that one summer
Or those steamy nights in Spain
You always melted
When I would praise you
And My stupid jokes
They would never phase you
--- Unknown ---
That don't mean shit
Next to all the ways you
Drove Me So Insane
--- Unknown ---
You're a cock-frickin' tease
Girl, you never stop you're talking
At sometimes you've got a double chin
You may say it's good fun
But your racist rants are shocking
And your lips don't need more collagen
--- Unknown ---
All you care about is how much someone
Makes and what they do
Not a man in his right mind would ever
Fall in love with you
--- Unknown ---
You always criticized the
Clothes that I would wear
And found a way of pointing out
My thinning hair
really nice
You turned me vegan
Which I totally despise
And I'm pretty sure you laughed
That time I said
Lets Compromise
--- Unknown ---
If you were shot, or beaten
Or run over by a truck
I guess that I'd be sad
But then again...
It wouldn't suck
It wouldn't suck
--- Unknown ---
So goodbye. Hit the road
As a girlfriend you are fired
Find another chump that you can fleece
Years from now, when you're old
And you finally expired,
Girl I hope that you don't rest in peace
--- Unknown ---
Never met someone so selfish
Half the time, my balls were blue
--- Unknown ---
After all that I've endured now
You can safely rest assured now
That your ex is up and cured now
--- Unknown ---
Yes I'm so done being in love
In love with you
Whoa, we're through
Yeah, yeah, whoa
--- Unknown ---
Yes we're done, Allison
Honeybun, it's like over
It was on, and now we're gone
And I've regained my composure
So God Bless, you're a mess
And that's what you call closure
