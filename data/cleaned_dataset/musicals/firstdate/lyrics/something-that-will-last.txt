------ Something That Will Last ------
--- CASEY ---
I am standing at the start
Of something that is new
I can't keep building walls
Despite what I've been through
If I may have found the someone
The one I should be looking for
I'd be a jerk to run away
So I'll hold my breath and stay
--- AARON ---
There's a person by my side
She's not who I had planned
Yet I feel the sudden urge
To reach out and take her hand
And I yearn for letting go of
All the baggage in my past
If I don't try, I'll never know
Just how far this thing might go
--- BOTH ---
We can make it to tomorrow
Or just end it all right here
We could fall flat on our faces
Or fall more in love each year
--- AARON ---
With so little to be sure of
--- CASEY ---
Possibilities are vast
--- BOTH ---
This may be one perfect moment
Or maybe this is something
That will last
--- Unknown ---
CASEY [Spoken]
Well, this is my place
--- Unknown ---
AARON [Spoken]
Ahh yes, so it is
Nice building
Excellent structural engineering
With the...
--- Unknown ---
GABE [Spoken]
Quit stalling and tap that shit already!
--- Unknown ---
AARON [Spoken]
...Columns and bricks
--- Unknown ---
CASEY [Spoken]
Thank you, I designed it all myself
--- Unknown ---
LAUREN [Spoken]
Okay, you're gonna give him
One quick kiss on the cheek
But that's it
V-town is closed to the public
--- Unknown ---
ALLISON [Spoken]
You are so not ready
To take things to the
Next level with this girl
What you really need to do
Is continue waiting for me
--- Unknown ---
EDGY ROCKER GUY [Spoken]
See the problem?
We would've already
Been on your bedroom floor by now
--- Unknown ---
FRIENDLY THERAPIST [Spoken]
Blah, blah, blah
More therapy!
--- Unknown ---
AARON [Spoken]
Alright, goodnight Casey
--- Unknown ---
CASEY [Spoken]
Goodnight, Aaron
--- Unknown ---
GABE [Spoken]
Dude, are you seriously walking away?
You know who hates you right now?
The entire male species!
--- AARON ---
We could make it to tomorrow
If I'd only take the chance
--- Unknown ---
GABE [Spoken]
Yes, for the love of god
Take a chance!
--- CASEY ---
If we say goodbye forever
Would I miss some true romance?
--- Unknown ---
LAUREN [Spoken]
It's a definite possibility
--- AARON ---
All the burdens that we carry
--- CASEY ---
Need to let them go, and fast
--- BOTH ---
So there's not one perfect moment
But rather there is something that will last
--- Unknown ---
I am through with holding on
I won't let mistakes and memories
Get the best of me
--- Unknown ---
Oh ooh whoa
--- Unknown ---
Though my doubts are far from gone
I will leap into the future
And just wait and see
--- Unknown ---
If we make it to tomorrow
If we stand the test of time
Or the wind's too strong against us
And we can't quite make the climb
All I know is in this moment
My past is just my past
Right now I can't help but wonder
If this could be the something that will last
--- CASEY ---
Could this be the something
--- AARON ---
Could this be the something
--- BOTH ---
That will last?
