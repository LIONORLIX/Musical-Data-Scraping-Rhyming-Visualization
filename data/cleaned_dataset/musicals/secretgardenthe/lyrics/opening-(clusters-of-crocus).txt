------ Opening (Clusters of Crocus) ------
--- LILY ---
Clusters of crocus,
Purple and gold
Blankets of pansies,
Out from the cold.
Lilies and iris,
Safe from the chill.
Safe in my garden,
Snowdrops so still.
--- FAKIR ---
Ah
A'o jadu ke mausam,
A'o garmiyo ke din.
A'o mantra tantra yantra,
Us ki bimari hata'o.
--- CHILDREN'S VOICE ---
Mistress Mary, quite contrary,
How does your garden grow?
Not so well, she said, see the lily's dead,
Pull it up and out you go.
--- Unknown ---
Mistress Mary, quite contrary,
How does your garden grow?
Far too hot, she cried, see my rose has died,
Dig it up, and out you go.
--- Unknown ---
Mistress Mary, quite contrary,
How does your garden grow?
Had an early frost, now it's gone, it's lost,
Dig it up, you're out, you're up
You're out, you're up
