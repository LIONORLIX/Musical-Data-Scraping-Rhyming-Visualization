------ There's A Girl ------
--- DREAMERS ---
Can it be a dream?
Surely it does seem
Like a frightful dream!
How can this be true?
--- Unknown ---
Won't her mother come?
Come, wake her up to play?
Won't her father say,
Here's a rose for you?
--- Unknown ---
There's a girl who no one sees,
There's a girl who's left alone.
There's a heart that beats in silence
For the life she's never known,
