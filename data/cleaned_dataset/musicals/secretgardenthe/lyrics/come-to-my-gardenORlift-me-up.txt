------ Come To My Garden/Lift Me Up ------
--- LILY ---
Come to my garden,
Nestled in the hills.
There I'll keep you safe beside me.
--- Unknown ---
Come to my garden.
Rest there in my arms.
There I'll see you
Safely grown and on your way.

Stay there in the garden,
Where love grows free and wild.
Come to my garden.
Come, sweet child.

Lift me up and lead me to the garden,
Where life begins anew.
Where I'll find you,
And I'll find you love me too.
LILY:

Where life begins anew Rest there in my arms.
