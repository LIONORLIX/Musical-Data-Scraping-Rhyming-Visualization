------ Where In The World ------
--- ARCHIBALD ---
Now I see you in the window
Of a carriage, then a train.
Still my mind cannot accept that
In your grave you must remain.
I hear your voice then turn and
See a stranger's form and face.
Must I wander on tormented
Place to place to place to place!
--- Unknown ---
Where can I go that you won't find me?
Why can't I find a place to hide?
Why do you have to chase me, haunt me?
Every step there beside me.
--- Unknown ---
Where in the world, tell me, where in the world
Can I live without your love?
Why on the earth, tell me why on the earth
Should I stay now that you are gone?
Why did I have to meet you, love you?
Why can't I rid you from my mind?
Why did you have to want me?
Won't you let me put my life behind me?
--- Unknown ---
How in the world, tell me how in the world
Can I live without your love?
Why on the earth, tell me, why on the earth
Should I stay now that you are gone?
Now that you are...
