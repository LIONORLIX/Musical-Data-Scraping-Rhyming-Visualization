------ Letter Song ------
--- MARY ---
D-E-A-R Uncle Archie,
How are you?
I'm fine. Everybody else is too.
Please come home.
--- ARCHIBALD ---
Home.
I have no home.
--- MARY ---
Martha says that you're in Paris.
--- ARCHIBALD ---
It's a house, child.
--- MARY ---
Is that very far away?
--- ARCHIBALD ---
It's just a house,
--- MARY ---
Do they have nice girls and boys there?
--- ARCHIBALD ---
And I can't get far enough away from it.
--- MARY ---
Please come home.
--- MARTHA ---
Now, just sign it.
--- MARY ---
Should I say that Colin's well now?
--- ARCHIBALD ---
Streets of Paris, like a maze.
--- MARY ---
Should I say that Doctor Craven...
--- ARCHIBALD ---
Sleepless nights and aimless days.
--- MARTHA ---
I think that what you have is good.
Let's get it posted on its way.
He'll rush home, then you can tell
Him all the rest you have to say.
--- MARY ---
Oh, kind sir, Uncle Archie, ARCHIBALD:
Can't forget, can't eat,
I wish that you could see Or sleep, or live.
When you come in to the garden.
Please come home.
--- ARCHIBALD ---
Can't forgive.
--- MARY ---
Yours truly?
--- MARTHA ---
Well, maybe . . .
--- MARY ---
Sincerely?
--- MARTHA ---
How's about...
--- MARY ---
