------ Round-Shouldered Man ------
--- COLIN ---
Some nights I dream
That a round-shouldered man
Comes in my room
On a beam of moonlight.
He never says what he wants,
He just sits with a book in his handS.
--- Unknown ---
And then I dream
That the roound-shouldered man
Takes me off on a ride
Through the moorS by moonlight.
He never says where we'll go,
We just ride 'cross the hills 'till dawn.
--- Unknown ---
And some night I'm going to ask him,
Is the night sky black or blue?
I know the answer's in his book
Of all that's good and true.
--- Unknown ---
And once I dreamed
That the round-shouldered man
Took my hand and we walked
To a secret garden.
I never knew where we were,
We just sat in the crook of a broken tree.
--- Unknown ---
And some night I'm going to ask him
How the old moon turns to new.
I know the answer's in his book
Of all that's good and true.
I'm sure the answer's in his book
