COLIN:
Mary, what is it?
--- MARTHA ---
Mary, come quickly!
--- MARY ---
Wait 'till you see it!!
--- COLIN ---
Mary, what is it?
--- MARY ---
It's spring!
--- COLIN ---
But where did it come from?
--- MARTHA ---
From all your hard work, where do you think?
--- COLIN ---
Mary, look at the roses!
--- MARY ---
There are fountains of them!
--- COLIN ---
Mary, Mary, quite contrary,
How does your garden grow?
--- MARY ---
Colin! That's not fair!
--- NEVILLE ---
Archie, why didn't you cable us you were coming?
--- ARCHIBALD ---
I didn't know myself, Neville.
What on earth is all that noise?
--- COLIN ---
Oh, no, you don't! I'm lots faster than you are!
--- MARY ---
Colin Craven, not so fast!
--- NEVILLE ---
Mary Lennox!!
--- COLIN ---
Father?
--- ARCHIBALD ---
Oh, Colin!
--- COLIN ---
Look at me, Father! I'm well!
--- ARCHIBALD ---
Oh, Colin, my fine, brave boy!
Can you ever forgive me?
--- COLIN ---
It was the garden that did it, Father.
And Mary, and Dickon, and Martha.
Some kind of charm, it came right out of the ground!
--- ARCHIBALD ---
Yes? Oh, Colin. Colin, look at you!
--- COLIN ---
It was Ben that kept the garden alive, Father, until...
--- BEN ---
I knew it was against your orders sir, but I...
--- COLIN ---
And it was Dickon, who taught us how...
--- ARCHIBALD ---
Yes, I can just imagine.
Dickon, if there is ever anything we can do...
--- MARTHA ---
Sir, what is to become of our Mary?
--- ALBERT ---
[Sings]
Clusters of crocus
--- ARCHIBALD ---
Why, Mary, I'd nearly forgotten you in all this.
--- MARY ---
It's hard to remember everybody, sir.
--- ARCHIBALD ---
No, it isn't. Three isn't very many people at all.
I should be able to remember three people quite easily!
--- MARY ---
Would I be one of them?
--- ARCHIBALD ---
Mary Lennox, for as long as you will have us, we are yours,
Colin and I, and this is your home, and this, my lovely child,
is your garden!
--- DREAMERS ---
[Sing, fading]
Come to my garden, nestled in the hill.
There I'll keep you safe beside me.
Come to my garden. Rest there in my arms.
There I'll see you safely grown
--- ALBERT and LILY ---
And on your way.
Stay here in the garden,
As days grow long and mild.
--- LILY ---
Come to my garden,
