--- MARY ---
Someone is crying, just now I heard them.
Someone in this house is crying.
Why won't they tell me? I know they're lying.
Someone here is lost, or mad.
I must try to find them,
Beg them stop so I can sleep.

I heard someone crying.
Who, tho', could it be?
Someone in this house,
Whom no one seems to see.
Someone no one seems to hear, except for me.
