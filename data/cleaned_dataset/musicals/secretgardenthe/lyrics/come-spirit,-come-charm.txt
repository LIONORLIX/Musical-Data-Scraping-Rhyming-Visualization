------ Come Spirit, Come Charm ------
--- MARY ---
Come spirit, come charm,
Come days that are warm,
Come magical spell,
Come help him get well.
--- DICKON ---
Come spirit, come charm,
Come days that are warm,
Come magical spell,
Come help him get well.
--- MARTHA, DICKON, LILY AND DREAMERS ---
Spirits are above, charms aloft on high!
Sweep away the storm comin' 'cross the sky!
See the rising sun, bid the breeze to fall,
Bid the robins sing, bid the roses grow!
--- ALL ---
Come spirit, come charm,
Come days that are warm,
Come magical spell,
Come help him get well.
Come, come spirit, come charm,
Come magical spell
Come help him get well.
