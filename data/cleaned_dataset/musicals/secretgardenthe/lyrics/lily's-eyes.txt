------ Lily's Eyes ------
--- NEVILLE ---
Strangely quiet, but now the storm
Simply rests to strike again.
Standing, waiting, I think of her.
I think of her.
--- ARCHIBALD ---
Strange, this Mary, she leaves the room,
Yet remains, She lingers on.
Something stirs me to think of her.
I think of her.
--- NEVILLE ---
From death she casts her spell,
All night we hear her sighs,
And now a girl has come
Who has her eyes.
--- Unknown ---
She has her eyes.
The girl has Lily's hazel eyes,
Those eyes that saw him happy long ago.
Those eyes that gave him life
And hope he'd never known.
How can he see the girl
And miss those hazel eyes?
--- ARCHIBALD ---
She has her eyes.
The girl has Lily's hazel eyes,
Those eyes that closed and left me all alone.
Those eyes I feel will never ever let me go!
How can I see this girl who has her hazel eyes?
--- Unknown ---
In Lily's eyes a castle
This house seemed to be,
And I, the bravest knight, became,
My lady fair was she.
--- NEVILLE ---
She has her eyes.
She has my Lily's hazel eyes.
Those eyes that loved my brother-never me.
Those eyes that never saw me,
Never knew I longed
To hold her close,
To live at last in Lily's Eyes!
--- ARCHIBALD ---
Imagine me, a lover!
--- NEVILLE ---
I longed for the day
She'd turn and see me standing there.
--- NEVILLE: ARCHIBALD ---
Would God have let her stay! Would God have let her stay!
She has her eyes. She has her eyes.
She has Lily's hazel eyes. My Lily's hazel eyes.
Those eyes that saw me
Those eyes that first I loved so! Happy long ago.
--- Unknown ---
How can How can
I now forget I now forget
That once I dared to be That once I dared to be in love.
--- Unknown ---
To be alive and whole Alive and whole
In Lily's eyes, In Lily's eyes,
