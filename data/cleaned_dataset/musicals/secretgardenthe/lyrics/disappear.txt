------ Disappear ------
--- Unknown ---
There's nothing here that I want.
How dare she make this claim?
Isn't it clear what I want?
To serve has been my aim.
--- Unknown ---
Still, I have to wonder
Who I'd be,
If it all belonged to me.
--- Unknown ---
If they'd all disappear,
I'd start again.
I could be happy then,
I'd live like other men
--- Unknown ---
If they'd all disappear
I could be free.
Cut off from pain and loss,
