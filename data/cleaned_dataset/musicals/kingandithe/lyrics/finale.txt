Was he as good a King as he could have been?

I don't think any man has ever been as good a King as he
could have been. But this one tried, he tried very hard.

Yes, Louis, I liked him very much. Very much indeed.

Second proclamation.

Yes, what is your second proclamation? Make it! Make it!

Regarding custom a-bowing to King, unfashionable at all.
I do not believe this is good thing. Causing embarrassing
To everybody, degrading experience or so, etecetara,
etecetara, etecetara! And this bad thing, I believe. You
are angry with me, my father?

Oh, why do you ask question? When you are a king, you are king!
You do not ask question of sick man, nor of woman! Misses Anna,
this proclamation against bowing to king, I believe to be your
fault!

Oh I hope so, your Majesty! I do hope so!
