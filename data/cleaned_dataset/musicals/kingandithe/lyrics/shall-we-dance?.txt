------ Shall We Dance? ------

Anna
[Spoken]
Oh but it's very exciting, when you're young at your first dance,
and you're sitting on a small quilt chair with your eyes lowered,
terrified that you'd be a wallflower. And suddenly you see two
black shoes, a white waistcoat, a face, it speakes...

Anna
[Sung]
We've just been introduced,
I do not know you well,
But when the music started
Something drew me to your side.
So many men and girls,
Are in each others arms-
It made me think we might be
Similarly occupied.
Shall we dance?
On a bright cloud of music shall we fly?
Shall we dance?
Shall we then say Goodnight and mean Goodbye?
Or perchance,
When the last little star has left the sky,
Shall we still be together
With are arms around each other
And shall you be my new romance?
On the clear understanding
That this kind of thing can happen,
Shall we dance?
Shall we dance? Shall we Dance?

Dancing girl...In England no woman would dance while a
Man is looking at her...
