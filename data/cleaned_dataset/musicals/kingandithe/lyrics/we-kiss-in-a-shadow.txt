------ We Kiss in a Shadow ------
--- Unknown ---
Lun Tha
We kiss in a shadow,
We hide from the moon,
Our meetings are few,
And over too soon.
We speak in a whisper,
Afraid to be heard;
When people are near,
We speak not a word.
Alone in our secret,
Together we sigh,
For one smiling day to be free
To kiss in the sunlight
And say to the sky:
Behold and believe what you see!
Behold how my lover loves me!
