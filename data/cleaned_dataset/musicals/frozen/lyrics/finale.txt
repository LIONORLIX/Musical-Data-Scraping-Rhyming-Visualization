SERVANT: (spoken)
We are, your Majesty
Rest assured
--- ELSA ---
There's so much I've longed to say
--- ANNA ---
Then say it all beginning with today
--- ELSA ---
It's like a dream, I thought could never be
--- ANNA ---
Elsa, you're free
Let it go, let it go
Show us what you can do
--- ENSEMBLE ---
Let it go, let it go
--- ELSA ---
The magic one is you
'Cause here we stand
In the light of day
Let the sun shine on
--- Unknown ---
I take this warmth within and send it up above
--- ELSA & ANNA ---
Goodbye to dark and fear
Let's fill this world with light and love
--- ELSA ---
I'm here sourrounded by a family at last
--- ENSEMBLE ---
We're never going back
The past is in the past (The past is in the past)
Let it go, let it go
Then we'll rise like the break of dawn
Let it go, let it go
The fear and cold are gone
Here we stand in the light of day
Let our true love go
Let it go
