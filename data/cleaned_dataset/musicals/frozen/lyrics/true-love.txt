------ True Love ------
--- Anna ---
I've sat alone in this room before
Hours and hours on end
I know this delusional 'Wish the door
Will open to reveal a friend'
--- Unknown ---
I know this solitude
I know this kind of cold
But I had faith in what the stories told
Of true love
How I'd find true love
--- Unknown ---
And here I am in this room again
Just as lost and small
That lonely girl with a desperate heart
Is who I am, after all
--- Unknown ---
There's no escaping her
But now the dream is gone
Because I spend a lifetime counting on
True love
True love
--- Unknown ---
I was looking for a fairy tale
And dove headfirst into his
Turns out, you cant find love
If you don't know what it is
--- Unknown ---
And now it's clear I'll never leave this room
It ends as it began
With no one but myself to blame
I played my part
In the plan
--- Unknown ---
Dreaming got me here
And yet the dream won't die
I can't wish it away
No matter how I try
--- Unknown ---
True love
True love
True love
