------ Kristoff Lullaby ------
--- KRISTOFF ---
What is this hollow kind of helplessness I'm feeling?
This type of terror is new
And the fact that I can hardly breathe is now revealing
How much I've changed 'cause of you
--- Unknown ---
You light the world for me
You live life fearlessly
Braver than the bravest of us do
You trust, you hope, you dare
You choose to feel and care
I thought that I was strong till I bumped into you
--- Unknown ---
What do I know about love?
What do I know about love?
--- Unknown ---
Everything I thought I did
You've gone and changed it kid
You're what I know about love
