DUKE OF WESELTON: (spoken)
It's a trap!
--- Unknown ---
HANS: (spoken)
Enough, please
What the Queen's motivations are, I cannot say
But I assure you, Anna is pure and noble
--- Unknown ---
DUKE OF WESELTON: (spoken)
Why should we listen to you?
--- Unknown ---
HANS: (singing)
I'm only the thirteenth son of a king
Nor am I your leader, only her fianc√©
But my love for her has made something clear
We can't give into fear
Not here, not today
--- Unknown ---
We can't know how threatening
The road ahead will be
But put your faith in Anna
The way that Anna put her faith in me
--- Unknown ---
I can't tell you what the princess sees in me
But let me tell you what an honor it would be
If you could let me lead you through this time of trials
You ask for a leader, a servant responds
Trust Hans of the Southern Isles
--- Unknown ---
TOWNSPERSON: (spoken)
But what of the cold?
What of the Queen?
What if she really is a monster?
--- Unknown ---
HANS: (spoken)
Then she will be dealt with
And Anna and I will lead you back to Summer
--- Unknown ---
DUKE OF WESSLETON: (spoken)
Go along with it!
--- Unknown ---
HANS: (singing)
He's more than the thirteenth son of a king
--- TOWNSPERSON ---
We're lucky he came along at our time of need
--- MALE TOWNSPEOPLE ---
We'll never give in to fear and treason
--- TOWNSPEOPLE ---
Let's listen to reason and follow his lead
--- HANS ---
Who will come with me?
--- DUKE OF WESSLETON ---
My men and I, my lord
Yes Wessleton arises and offers up the power of his sword
--- HANS ---
I call to your kingdom
--- TOWNSPEOPLE ---
Our kingdom responds to Hans
Prince Hans of the Southern Isles
