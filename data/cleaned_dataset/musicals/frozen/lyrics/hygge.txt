------ Hygge ------
--- OAKEN ---
Here in Arendelle
The winters can be… well…
Let’s just say it’s not so very good
But even at this latitude
We’ll keep a happy attitude
Until we burn our final piece of wood
See, there’s a word we live by
To keep our feelings great
You don’t have this word in English
But allow me to translate
Hygge!

Hygge means comfortable
Hygge means cozy
Hygge means sitting by the fire with your cheeks all rosy
Hygge hygge hygge hygge hygge hygge
Hygge hygge hygge hygge hygge hygge
Hyggelig hyggelig hyggelig hyggelig hyggelig hyggelig
I will translate more!

Hygge means candlelight
Hygge means easy
Hygge means all you care to play, how you say? Parcheesi!
Finding a spider in your shoe
Not hygge!
Having an annoying thing to do
Not hygge!
Hygge’s not scheduled
You can’t see where it starts or ends
Most importantly it can’t be hygge without your family and friends!

And... Hi sir!
I was hoping you’d have a slightly less smelly,
More size-appropriate winter outfit or something for climbing the North Mountain

OAKEN: (spoken)
Something for climbing the North Mountain where many have frozen to death? Yeah!
I have exactly what you need! Hygge!

ANNA: (spoken)
Hygge? What’s hygge?

OAKEN: (singing)
Hygge is alchool
Hygge is eating
Hygge is gloog
Amazing stuff when you are needing heating!
Hygge means you're friendly
You stop wanting to be rude
Join us for some super duper hygge
In the sauna in the nude!

A toast to all our family and friends
To Hygge in a storm that never ends
So let it keep on going
We always have each other
The gloog is brewed
We’re here, we’re nude
And so let’s have another

ANNA: (spoken)
He’s right
We have to go
We have an urgent job to do

You need this rope and this ax
And also you need to relax
Please take this sweater, I need it
And son if I may be permitted
He might advice at the little
Say vice you're about to go out at the deaf march of ice
Take all of the carrots and also that flask
For your lethal and ludicrous task

If we're all dead...
--- OAKEN ---
...Keep this stuff as a loaner
If we survive... you owe us ten thousand kroner
Deal?
