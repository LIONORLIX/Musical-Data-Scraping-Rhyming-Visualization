------ Do You Want to Build a Snowman? ------
--- ANNA (Age 5) ---
Do you want to build a snowman?
Come on let’s go and play!
I never see you anymore, come out the door,
It’s like you’ve gone away
We used to be best buddies and now we’re not,
I wish you would tell me why
Do you want to build a snowman?
It doesn’t have to be a snowman
--- ELSA (Age 8) ---
Go away, Anna!
--- ANNA (Age 5) ---
Okay, bye
--- ANNA (Age 9) (knocks) ---
Do you want to build a snowman?
Or ride our bike around the halls?
I think some company is overdue,
I started talking to, the pictures on the walls —
Hang in there, Joan!
It gets a little lonely, all these empty rooms,
Just watching the hours tick by…

Elsa?
Please I know you’re in there,
people are asking where you’ve been
They say ‘have courage,’ and I’m trying to,
I’m right out here for you, just let me in
We only have each other,
It’s just you and me, what are we gonna do?
Do you want to build a snowman?
