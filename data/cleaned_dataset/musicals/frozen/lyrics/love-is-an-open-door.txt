------ Love Is an Open Door ------
--- Unknown ---
ANNA: Okay, can I just, say something crazy?
--- Unknown ---
HANS: I love crazy!
--- ANNA ---
All my life has been a series of doors in my face
And then suddenly I bump into you
--- HANS ---
I was thinking the same thing! â€˜Cause like
I've been searching my whole life to find my own place
And maybe it's the party talking or the chocolate fondue
--- Unknown ---
ANNA: But with you
HANS: But with you
--- Unknown ---
HANS: I found my place
ANNA: I see your face
--- BOTH ---
And it's nothing like I've ever known before
Love is an open door
Love is an open door
Love is an open door
--- Unknown ---
ANNA: With you
HANS: With you
ANNA: With you
HANS: With you
--- Unknown ---
BOTH: Love is an open door
--- Unknown ---
HANS: I mean it's crazy
ANNA: What?
--- Unknown ---
HANS: We finish each other's
ANNA: Sandwiches
--- Unknown ---
HANS: That's what I was gonna say!
--- Unknown ---
ANNA: I've never met someone
--- BOTH ---
Who thinks so much like me
Jinx! Jinx again!
Our mental synchronization
Can have but one explanation
--- Unknown ---
HANS: You
ANNA: And I
HANS: Were
ANNA: Just
--- Unknown ---
BOTH: Meant to be
--- Unknown ---
ANNA: Say goodbye
HANS: Say goodbye
--- BOTH ---
To the pain of the past
We don't have to feel it any more
Love is an open door
Love is an open door
Life can be so much more
--- Unknown ---
ANNA: With you
HANS: With you
ANNA: With you
HANS: With you
--- Unknown ---
BOTH: Love is an open door
--- Unknown ---
HANS: Can I say something crazy? Will you marry me?
ANNA: Can I say something even crazier? Yes!
