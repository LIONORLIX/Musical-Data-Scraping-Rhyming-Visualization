------ Fixer Upper ------
--- BULDA ---
What's the issue, dear? Why are you holding back from such a man?
--- TROLLS ---
Is it the clumpy way he walks or the grumpy way he talks?
Or the pear-shaped, square-shaped weirdness of his feet?
And though we know he washes well-he always ends up sort of smelly
But you'll never meet a fellow who's as sensitive and sweet!
--- Unknown ---
So he's a bit of a fixer-upper, so he's got a few flaws
Like his peculiar brain-dear, his thing with the reindeer
That's a little outside of nature's laws!
--- Unknown ---
So he's a bit of a fixer-upper, but this we're certain of
You can fix this fixer-upper up with a little bit of love!
--- KRISTOFF ---
Can we please just stop talking about this?
We've got a real, actual problem here
--- Unknown ---
BULDA: I'll say! So tell me, dear
--- TROLLS ---
Is it the way that he runs scared, or that he's socially impaired
Or that he only likes to tinkle in the woods â€” what?!
Are you holding back your fondness due to his unmanly blondness
Or the way he covers up that he's the honest goods
--- Unknown ---
He's just a bit of a fixer-upper, he's got a couple of bugs
His isolation is confirmation of his desperation for human hugs
So he's a bit of a fixer-upper, but we know what to do
The way to fix up this fixer-upper is to fix him up with you!
--- Unknown ---
KRISTOFF: ENOUGH! She is engaged to someone else, okay?!
--- Unknown ---
(beat)
--- TROLLS ---
So she's a bit of a fixer-upper, that's a minor thing
This quote 'engagement' is a flex arrangement
And by the way I don't see no ring!
So she's a bit of a fixer-upper, her brain's a bit betwixt
Get the fiance out of the way and the whole thing will be fixed
--- Unknown ---
We're not saying you can change her, 'cuz people don't really change
We're only saying that love's a force that's powerful and strange
People make bad choices if they're mad, or scared, or stressed
Throw a little love their way (throw a little love their way)
And you'll bring out their best
True love brings out their best!
--- Unknown ---
Everyone's a bit of a fixer-upper, that's what it's all about!
Father! Sister! Brother! We need each other to raise us up and round us out
Everyone's a bit of a fixer-upper, but when push comes to shove
--- OLAF ---
The only fixer-upper fixer that can fix up a fixer-upper is
--- TROLLS ---
True, true, true, true, true, true, love
True love, love, love, love, love, true love
--- Unknown ---
True
--- Unknown ---
TROLL: Do you, Anna, take Kristoff to be your troll-fully wedded
--- Unknown ---
ANNA: Wait, what!?
--- Unknown ---
TROLL: You're getting married!
--- Unknown ---
TROLLS: Love!
