------ For the First Time in Forever ------
--- ANNA ---
The window is open, so's that door
I didn't know they did that anymore
And there's two nice ladies helping me get dressed
For years I've roamed these empty halls
Why have a ballroom with no balls?
Coronation day is just the best!
--- Unknown ---
There'll be actual real live people
It'll be totally strange
But wow, am I so ready for this change
--- Unknown ---
'Cause for the first time in forever
There'll be music, there'll be light
For the first time in forever
I'll be dancing through the night
--- Unknown ---
Don't know if I'm elated or gassy
But I'm somewhere in that zone
'Cause for the first time in forever
I won't be alone
--- Spoken ---
Oh I can't wait to meet everyone! (gasp)
What if I meet... the one?
--- Sung ---
Tonight imagine me gown and all
Fetchingly draped against the wall
The picture of sophisticated grace
Ooh! I suddenly see him standing there
A beautiful stranger, tall and fair
I wanna stuff some chocolate in my face
--- Unknown ---
But then we laugh and talk all evening,
Which is totally bizarre
Nothing like the life I've lead so far
--- Unknown ---
For the first time in forever
There'll be magic, there'll be fun
For the first time in forever
I could be noticed by someone
--- Unknown ---
And I know it is totally crazy
To dream I'd find romance
But for the first time in forever
At least I've got a chance
--- ELSA ---
Don't let them in, don't let them see
Be the good girl you always have to be
Conceal, don't feel, put on a show
Make one wrong move and everyone will know
--- Unknown ---
ELSA: But it's only for today
ANNA: It's only for today
--- Unknown ---
ELSA: It's agony to wait
ANNA: It's agony to wait
--- Unknown ---
ELSA: Tell the guards to open up the gate
ANNA: The gate
--- Unknown ---
ANNA: For the first time in forever
--- Unknown ---
ELSA: Don't let them in, don't let them see
--- Unknown ---
ANNA: I'm getting what I'm dreaming of
ELSA: Be the good girl you always have to be
--- Unknown ---
ANNA: A chance to leave my lonely world
ELSA: Conceal
--- Unknown ---
ANNA: A chance to find true love
ELSA: Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know
--- ENSEMBLE ---
For the first time in forever
We are all the song outside
For the first time in forever
The gates are open wide
--- ANNA ---
I know it all ends tomorrow,
So it has to be today
'Cause for the first time in forever
For the first time in forever
Nothing's in my way!
--- Unknown ---
ENSEMBLE: Today!
