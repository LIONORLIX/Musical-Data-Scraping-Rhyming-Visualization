--- ELSA ---
It's finally come
Come to knock down my door
I can't hide this time
Like I hid before
--- Unknown ---
The storm is awake
The danger is real
My time's running out
Don't feel, don't feel
--- Unknown ---
"Fear will be your enemy
And death it's consequence
That's what they once said to me
And it's starting to make sense
--- Unknown ---
All this pain,
All this fear began because of me
Is the thing they see
The thing I have to be
--- Unknown ---
A monster
Were they right?
Has the dark in me
finally come to light?
--- Unknown ---
Am I a monster?
Full of rage
Nowhere to go, but on a rampage
--- Unknown ---
Or am I just a monster
In a cage
--- HANS & VOLUNTEERS ---
End this winter
Bring back summer
Keep your guard up
--- HANS ---
No harm comes to her
--- HANS & VOLNTEERS ---
End this winter
Bring back summer
Keep your guard up
--- ELSA ---
What do I do
No time for crying now
I've started a storm
Got to stop it somehow
--- Unknown ---
Do I keep on running
How far do I have to go
And would that take the storm away
Or only make it grow
--- Unknown ---
I'm making my world colder
How long can it survive?
Is everyone in danger
As long as I'm alive?
--- Unknown ---
Was I a monster
From the start?
How did I end up with this frozen heart?
--- Unknown ---
Bringing destruction
To the stage
Caught in a war that
I never meant to wage
--- Unknown ---
Do I kill the monster?
--- Unknown ---
Father, you know what's best for me
If I die will they be free?
--- Unknown ---
Mother, what if after I'm gone
The cold gets colder
And the storm rages on?
--- Unknown ---
No!
I have to stay alive
To fix what I've done
Save the world from myself
And bring back the sun
--- HANS & VOLNTEERS ---
End this winter
Bring back summer
Keep your guard up
--- ELSA ---
If I'm a monster
Then it's true
There's only one thing
that's left for me to do
--- Unknown ---
But before I fade to ice
I'll do all that I can
to make things right
--- Unknown ---
I cannot be a monster
I will not be a monster
Not tonight
--- HANS & VOLUNTEERS ---
Monster
Monster
Monster
