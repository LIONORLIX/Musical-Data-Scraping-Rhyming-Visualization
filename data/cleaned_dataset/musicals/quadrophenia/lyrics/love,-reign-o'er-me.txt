------ Love, Reign O'er Me ------
--- Unknown ---
Only love can make it rain
The way the beach is kissed by the sea
Only love can make it rain
Like the sweat of lovers layin' in the fields
--- Unknown ---
Love, reign o'er me
Love, reign o'er me
Rain on me, rain on me
--- Unknown ---
Only love can bring the rain
That makes you yearn to the sky
Only love can bring the rain
That falls like tears from on high
--- Unknown ---
Love, reign o'er me
Rain on me, rain on me
Love, reign o'er me
Rain on me, rain on me
--- Unknown ---
On the dry and dusty road
The nights we spend apart alone
I need to get back home to cool, cool rain
--- Unknown ---
I can't sleep, and I lay, and I think
The night is hot and black as ink
Oh God, I need a drink of cool, cool rain
--- Unknown ---
Love, reign o'er me
Reign o'er me, o'er me, o'er me
Love, reign o'er me, o'er me
