------ I'm One ------
--- Unknown ---
Every year is the same
And I feel it again,
I'm a loser - no chance to win.
Leaves start falling,
Come down is calling,
Loneliness starts sinking in.
--- Unknown ---
But I'm one.
I am one.
And I can see
That this is me,
And I will be,
You'll all see
I'm the one.
--- Unknown ---
Where do you get
Those blue blue jeans?
Faded patched secret so tight.
Where do you get
That walk oh so lean?
Your shoes and your shirts
All just right.
But I'm one etc.
--- Unknown ---
I got a Gibson
Without a case
But I can't get that even tanned look on my face.
Ill fitting clothes
I blend in the crowd,
Fingers so clumsy
Voice too loud.
--- Unknown ---
But I'm one.
