------ The Real Me ------
--- Unknown ---
I went back to the doctor
To get another shrink.
I sit and tell him about my weekend,
But he never betrays what he thinks.
--- Unknown ---
Can you see the real me, doctor?
--- Unknown ---
I went back to my mother
I said, I'm crazy ma, help me.
She said, I know how it feels son,
'Cause it runs in the family.
--- Unknown ---
Can you see the real me, mother?
--- Unknown ---
The cracks between the paving stones
Look like rivers of flowing veins.
Strange people who know me
Peeping from behind every window pane.
The girl I used to love
Lives in this yellow house.
Yesterday she passed me by,
She doesn't want to know me now.
--- Unknown ---
Can you see the real me, can you?
--- Unknown ---
I ended up with the preacher,
Full of lies and hate,
I seemed to scare him a little
So he showed me to the golden gate.
--- Unknown ---
Can you see the real me preacher?
Can you see the real me doctor?
Can you see the real me mother?
