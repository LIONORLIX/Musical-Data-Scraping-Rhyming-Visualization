------ 5:15 ------
--- Unknown ---
Why should I care?
Why should I care?
--- Unknown ---
Girls of fifteen
Sexually knowing
The ushers are sniffing
Eau-de-cologning
--- Unknown ---
The seats are seductive
Celibate sitting
Pretty girls digging
Prettier women
--- Unknown ---
Magically bored
On a quiet street corner
Free frustration
In our minds and our toes
--- Unknown ---
Quiet storm water
M-m-my generation
Uppers and downers
Either way blood flows
--- Unknown ---
Inside outside, leave me alone
Inside outside, nowhere is home
Inside outside, where have I been?
Out of my brain on the 5:15
Out of my brain on the train
Out of my brain on the train
--- Unknown ---
A raft in the quarry
Slowly sinking
Back of a lorry
Holy hitching
--- Unknown ---
Dreadfully sorry
Apple scrumping
Born in a war
Birthday punching
--- Unknown ---
He man drag
In the glittering ballroom
Gravely outrageous
In my high heel shoes
--- Unknown ---
Tightly undone
Know what they're showing
Sadly ecstatic
That their heroes are news
--- Unknown ---
Inside outside, leave me alone
Inside outside, nowhere is home
Inside outside, where have I been?
Out of my brain on the 5:15
Out of my brain on the train
Out of my brain on the train, on the train
I'm out of my brain
--- Unknown ---
Out of my brain on the train
Here it comes
Out of my brain, on the train, on the train
Out of my brain on the train
--- Unknown ---
Why should I care?
