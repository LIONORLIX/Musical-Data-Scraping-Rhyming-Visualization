------ Through the Mountain ------
--- NELLIE ---
But why can all a' you go?
Like fire!
Like air!
'T ain't fair
that all a' you go.
You men,
goin' under,
always scootin' 'round
an' a-runnin' things.
Always goin' 'roun an' a-runnin' things.
Tick tock tick tock,
tock tick tock!
I'm achin' a' go! Please!
I'm achin' t' set him free.
What's wrong with me?
What's wrong with me?
--- Unknown ---
I'm a-walk you through the mountain
on a bearskin rug,
Through the great halls you dream of
an' tell of so often.
I'm a-keep you jes' as warm
as a goodnight hug,
As we follow 'long the diamonds
to the outside.
--- Unknown ---
You kin take me on a tour
of the em'rald towers.
To the spires of sapphires
an' waterfalls a' crystal.
We'll lay down to sleep
with the gypsum flowers,
as we follow 'long the diamonds
to the outside. Ooh
--- Unknown ---
Gonna git you outta there,
To a land a' babies dancin'
with a banjo in the air.
An' the sky is all lit up
with lemons and roses;
Ev'rythin' from your head
to your toes is warm.
Listen to me now.
--- Unknown ---
I'm a-walk you through the mountain
on a bearskin rug.
Through the great halls your dream of
an' tell of so often.
I'm a-take you by the hand
an' with a gentle tug,
We'll be gone,
We'll be long gone,
As we follow 'long the diamonds
to the outside.
As we follow 'long the diamonds
to the outside.
