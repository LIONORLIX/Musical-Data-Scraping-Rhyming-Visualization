------ I Landed on Him ------
--- MILLER ---
I landed on him!
That thing!
Horrible!
Wet...
Something, jelly
or worms,
or something...
My hand on him,
God!
For Christ's sake!
Head of hair!
No; oh, no...
Moanin',
thirstin',
groanin',
or yelpin' like croakin;...
Alive?
Christ's sake!
Chattering... so awful cold.
Helpless, animal...
and hopeless, I think...
Hopeless...
I am not there.
It is not me.
Get hold over it!
It's over.
You're out.
