------ Hello, Is Anybody Home ------
--- GEORGE McFLY, spoken ---
I know what you're gonna say, son, and you're right... you're right, but, uh, Biff just happens to be my supervisor and, uh, I'm not very good at confrontations...
--- MARTY McFLY ---
My father doesn't have a spine
He grovels, scrapes, and toes the line
Hello
Is anybody home?
Completely lost; a hopeless case
Hey, he'd come in third in a two-man race
Hello
Is anybody home?
--- GEORGE ---
Listen Marty, you shouldn't, uh, waste your time auditioning for these silly events. They'll only bring you rejection and headach?s. Just look at me...
--- Unknown ---
(sung)
I don't have ambitions
Big dreams of my own
Happy with th? way things are
Just leave me alone
I don't need the headaches too much money brings
Fancy cars, tailored shirts, shiny diamond rings
--- Unknown ---
Don't need the complications
--- Unknown ---
Success is overrated, overstated, overblown
Listen to my mantra:
Just leave me alone...
--- MARTY ---
Is anybody home?
--- DAVE McFLY, spoken ---
He's right Marty, the last thing you need is headaches
--- MARTY, spoken ---
Right, big brother. Like standing behind a burger counter makes you an expert on life, huh?
--- DAVE ---
I'm the man, oh yes I am
I got this thing wired
Have you heard, ten billion served?
Gets me so inspired
Salty satisfaction
Saturated fat
All I ever have to say:
You want fries with that?
--- Unknown ---
Woah
I'm a man in uniform
Arches on my hat
And all I ever have to say:
You want fries with that?
[LINDA McFLY]
Give me back my Prince CD!
--- DAVE ---
You want fries with that?
--- LINDA ---
And my Walkman if you please!
--- DAVE ---
You want fries with that?
The answer is a question; music to their ears
They'll all come back; it's just a fact
You want fries with that?
--- LINDA, spoken ---
Hey, Marty?
--- MARTY, spoken ---
Yeah, sis?
--- LINDA, spoken ---
I am not your answering service. Jennifer Parker called you... twice!
--- LORRAINE McFLY, spoken ---
Marty, I don't like her. Any girl who calls up a boy is just asking for trouble!
[LINDA, spoken]
Oh, mom, there's nothing wrong with calling a boy!
--- LORRAINE, spoken ---
I think it's terrible, girls chasing boys. When I was your age I never chased a boy, or kissed a boy, or sat in a parked car with a boy!
--- LINDA, spoken ---
Then how am I supposed to meet anybody?
--- LORRAINE, spoken ---
Well, when the time is right, it'll just happen
--- LINDA, sung ---
She tells me it'll happen
That the sun will rise and the stars will shine
All I ever seem to do
Is sit around and wait
I just wanna date
She says she never called a boy
Or chased a boy, even kissed a boy. Ugh!
What does she expect from me
'Cause she can't relate?
I just wanna, I just wanna, I just wanna date!
--- LORRAINE, spoken ---
Patience, Linda, it'll just happen, like the way I met your father
--- LINDA, spoken ---
Oh, that was so stupid! He fell out of a tree in front of your house!
--- LORRAINE, spoken ---
It was meant to be...
--- LORRAINE, sung ---
When life flows by so beautifully
With perfect friends and family
When love falls on you from a tree
Well, that's meant to be
--- McFLYS ---
Know it's meant to be
--- LORRAINE ---
You look around and you start to see
That you're living out your fantasy
It starts to feel like destiny
Like it's meant to be
--- LORRAINE & McFLYs ---
Know it's meant to, you were sent to, must be meant to be
--- LORRAINE, spoken ---
Anyway, Grandpa found your father lying in the street and brought him into the house. My heart just went out to him. So we went to the Enchantment Under the Sea dance, our first date. He kissed me for the first time on that dance floor
--- LORRAINE ---
There was something about that boy...
--- MARTY ---
Hello
Is anybody home?
--- LORRAINE ---
There was something about that boy...
--- MARTY ---
Hello, hello, hello?
And now the walls just keep closing in
And I don't know if I'll ever win
It's just the same as it's always been
No go! Hello? Too slow! Hello?!
--- DAVE, (LINDA), GEORGE, MARTY, LORRAINE ---
Hello? (Hello?)
Don't need the complications
Do you want fries with that? Aaah! (Hello?!)
Or pressure situations (I just wanna date!)
Know it's meant to be! Hello?! (Hello?!)
Is anybody home?
