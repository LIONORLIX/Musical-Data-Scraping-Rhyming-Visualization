------ Deep Divinâ€™ ------
--- Verse 1: Marvin Berry ---
In the South Sea Islands they dive for pearls
In the USA, they dive for girls
If you take your time and play it cool
There'll be somebody waiting at the end of the pool
Everybody says that you should look before you leap
And when I look at you I'm ready to go
--- Chorus: Marvin, (Backing Chorus), Marvin and chorus ---
Deep...
Deep divin' for love
And well I keep
Deep divin' for love (stop drownin'; a wee little routin')
There is just so much that we've been waiting to explore...
We'll find out every treasure on the ocean floor
So deep...
Deep divin' for love

--- Chorus: Marvin, (Backing Chorus), Marvin and chorus ---
(Deep divin' for love) Deep divin' for love...
Deep...
Deep divin' for love
So stop drownin', it will be little routin'
There is just so much that we've been waiting to explore...
We'll find out every treasure on the ocean floor
So deep... (so deep)
Deep divin' for love
