MARTY MCFLY: (spoken)
It's a time machine?!
Wait a minute, wait a minute Doc.
Are you trying to tell me that you built a time
machine out of a DeLorean?!
--- Unknown ---
DOC BROWN: (spoken)
Well, if you're gonna build a time machine into a car,
why not do it with some style?
--- Unknown ---
(sing)
I'm the architect of tick tock tech
A frequent flyer on a cosmic trek
I sorted through the quarks and quirks
And for once I know I made a thing that really works
It's a time machine that goes both ways
To new tomorrows and to yesterdays
It's a car for the stars like Captain Kirk's
And for once I knew I made a thing that really works
--- DOC BROWN & ENSEMBLE ---
It works! It works! It works!
In terms of the vernacular, it's spectacular!
Because it works! It works! It works!
And now I've found my glory (Oooo...ah)
In this stainless steel DeLorean (Oooo...ah)
It's gratifyin' knowing I was first (Ooooooo...ah)
Because it works!
--- MARTY MCFLY & DOC BROWN ---
Hey Doc, who are the girls? (Ha, ha, ha)
I don't know; they just show up every time I start singing!
--- DOC BROWN & ENSEMBLE ---
Blunt force trauma up against your head (ah-ooh)
Can put you in a coma; you could end up dead (ah-ooh)
Or calling for your momma but for me instead (ah-ooh)
That blunt force trauma when I slipped and hit my head
Shook something loose in me
Some high fruit in a tree
And that's when I could see
How fluid time can be
It gave me the connection (Ha, ha)
After decades of rejection (Ha, ha, A-a-a-ah)
I never really thought I'd get to see how well...
--- Unknown ---
It works! It works! It works!
And with this new invention I'll cut through the fourth dimension
'Cause it works! It works! It works!
I found what I was searching for
It's called the Flux Capacitor
It's this year's break-through scientific first
Because it works!
--- ENSEMBLE ---
Ha, ha, ha
Aaaaaah...
Yes, it... works!
--- DOC BROWN & ENSEMBLE ---
The secret was confined
And it's like I was blind, man
The solution was sublime
And I knew it all the time!
I didn't see how I could do it
Until I put my mind to it
--- Unknown ---
It works! It works! It works!
A space and time funicular but it's vehicular
Because it works! It works!
The world will write my story in...
This stainless steel... DeLorean...
The time continuum shall be traversed!
Because Marty...
It works! It works! It works!
It works! It works! It works!
