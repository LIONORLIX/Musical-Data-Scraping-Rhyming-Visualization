------ It’s Only a Matter of Time ------
--- MARTY McFLY ---
I'm lookin’ around
There's nothin' here can slow me down
It’s feelin' like my lucky day
Gonna make it and then skate away
I'll be on the radio
They'll know me everywhere I go
It won't be long; they're gonna see...
I'll be on MTV!
--- MARTY McFLY, (Backing Chorus), Both ---
I'll rock my future; a winner not a loser
Nothing anyone can say can make it any other way
I’ve got my future; a player not a cruiser
I’ll be just what I wanna be: rockin' all the way through history
--- Unknown ---
It’s feeling like a new day
Not another instant replay
Gonna finally do it my way! (Outlook looking good!)
Yeah!
--- Unknown ---
A perfect future, for a shak?r and a mover
Every note is in its plac? with lots of treble, lots of bass
I'll rock my future; could it be any cooler?
All I gotta do is play; my troubles disappear and go away
--- GOLDIE WILSON ---
Elect me, Goldie Wilson, for mayor! My new progress platform means more jobs, lower taxes and bigger civic improvements!
--- Unknown ---
Vote for me if you want to advance
I'll serve you faithfully if you'll give me a chance
I believe the future will be brighter than before
Hey, when I got started, I was sweeping up the floor!
--- Unknown ---
’Cause it's only a matter of time
Till the bells of prosperity chime
We'll be part of a new day
A long overdue day
I'll lead us as we make the climb!
--- Company, (MARTY McFLY), Both ---
It's only a matter of time
A new paradigm so sublime
Only a matter of-
It's just a matter of-
Outlook: oh so good! Yeah!
--- MARTY McFLY, (Backing Chorus), Both ---
Come on now future, let's hit the turbo booster
Buckled up without a care, now you can take it anywhere
Write my future (write my future)
For Simon and for Schuster
The Tale of How I Came To Be
A rock 'n roll biography... yeah!!! (Wooaaaaah!)
[Outro: Company, Ladies, Men, [MARTY McFLY], All]
But it's only a matter of time
(Only a matter of time) [Only a matter-]
Yes it's only a matter of-
Only a matter of ti-i-i-ime... [Yeah I know, I'm gettin' outta here!]
[The greatest future of all!]
What a future! Here's his future!
