------ Gotta Start Somewhere ------

Mayor Goldie Wilson... I like the sound of that!

What are you waitin' for?
Pick yourself up?from?the floor
If you?don't respect yourself
You won't get it?from no one else
No shame in workin' hard
Let them know that's who you are
Though I'm no man in the room
I'm still the best one with this broom
This ain't no step and fetch it
It's all part of the climb
There's a train, I'm gonna catch it
It's a matter of time
--- Unknown ---
But you gotta start somewhere
You gotta start somewhere
You gotta get going or you're never gonna get there
And once you g?t movin'
You'll find some way somehow
And it might as well b? right here right now
Come on boy!
You gotta start somewhere
--- Unknown ---
Listen up, sometimes you gotta sweep that negativity right outta the way!
--- Ensemble ---
Yeah!
--- Goldie, Goldie and Ensemble ---
Some people's road to fame
Begin on streets that have no name
It doesn't have to hold ya back
Once you're movin' on that track
Don't be confined to it
If you put your mind to it
You can always get your way
If you're willin' just to sweat your way
Don't give me the medial
Do the best you can
Remain congenial
And someday you'll be the man!
--- Goldie, (Ensemble), Both ---
But you gotta start somewhere
You gotta start somewhere
And make yourself useful
Or you're never gonna get there
Once you get movin'
You'll find some way somehow
And it might as well be right here right now
Come on boy!
You gotta start somewhere
You gotta start somewhere
You gotta get goin' (You're never)
Or you're never gonna get there
Once you get movin'
You'll find some way somehow
And it might as well be right here, right now!
Come on boy!

Keep moving and a-groovin'
It's honest state of mind
As long as you're improvin'
You won't feel left behind
--- Goldie, (Ensemble), Both ---
But you gotta start somewhere
You gotta start somewhere
Movin' or you'll
Never get there (Yeah!)
Once you get movin'
You'll find some way somehow
And it might as well be right here right now
Might as well be right here
You gotta start somewhere
You gotta start somewhere
Heeee-yeaaah!
