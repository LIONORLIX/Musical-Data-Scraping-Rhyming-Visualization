------ Donâ€™t Drive 88! ------
--- Marty McFly, Doc Brown ---
Hey Doc, what's happenin' to you?
I've been irradiated, so stay back! Stay way back! Or you will be too!
Doc, you gotta let me help you! Doc, you're dyin'! I'll go to the hospital! I'll get an ambulance!
County hospital's two miles away!
I'll drive like the wind, Doc-
But don't drive 88. Don't drive 88! Whatever you do, don't drive... 88!!!
