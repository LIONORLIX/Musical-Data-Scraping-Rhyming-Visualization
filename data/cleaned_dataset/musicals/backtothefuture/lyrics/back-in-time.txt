------ Back in Time ------
--- Verse 1: Marty McFly, (Backing Chorus), Both ---
Tell me, Doctor
Where are we goin' this time?
Is this the 50s, or 1999?
--- Unknown ---
All I wanted to do
Was play my guitar and sing
So take me away
I don't mind
But you better just promise me, I’ll be back in time (Back in time!)
Gotta get back in time
--- Verse 2: Doc Brown, Marty, Both, Company, (Backing Company) ---
Don’t bet your future
On one roll of the dice
Better remember
Lightning never strikes twice
--- Unknown ---
Please don't drive 88
Don’t wanna be late again
So take me away (Ooooooh)
I don't mind (wo-o-o-oah)
But you better just promise me, I’ll be back in time (Back in time!)
Gotta get back in time
You gotta get back in time
--- Verse 1: Full Cast, Marvin Berry, (Backing Company) ---
All I wanted to do
Was play my guitar and sing
So take me away
I don’t mind
But you better promise me
I’ll be back in time (Back in time!)
Ooooh, back in time! (back back)
Ooooh, back in time! (back back)
