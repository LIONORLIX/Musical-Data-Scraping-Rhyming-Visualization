New York, New York.
--- CHIP ---
The lights are out.
--- OZZIE ---
It's six o'clock.
C'mon fella, let's get back to the ship.
--- HILDY ---
Chip!
--- CLAIRE ---
Ozzie!

Pitkin understood.
He really understood!

(Enter three new sailors.)
--- THREE NEW SAILORS ---
New York, New York!
It's a helluva town!
--- Unknown ---
We've got one day here and not another minute
To see the famous sights!
We'll find the romance and danger waiting in it
Beneath the Broadway lights,
--- SAILORS, GABEY, OZZIE, CHIP ---
But we've hair on our chest
So what we like the best
Are the nights.
Sights! Lights! Nights!
--- ALL ---
New York, New York, a helluva town.
The Bronx is up, but the Battery's down.
The people ride in a hole in the groun'.
