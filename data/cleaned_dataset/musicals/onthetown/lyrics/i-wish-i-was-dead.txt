Gabey, this will cheer you up.
--- DIANA DREAM ---
I'm blue, my life is through.
I thought I had a date with you,
I guess I just don't rate with you,
I wish I was dead - and buried!!
--- Unknown ---
I'm blue, a cast-off shoe,
I'll break right down and cry tonight,
'Cause you told me a lie tonight,
I wish I was dead - and buried!
