------ New York! New York! ------
--- OZZIE ---
Come on, Gabey, hurry up!
--- CHIP ---
Twenty-four hours!
--- SAILOR ---
Hey, why don't ya look where you're goin'.
You'd think it was your first time in New York!
--- GABEY ---
It is!
--- Unknown ---
(The sailors look around them, happily absorbing the scene.)
--- GABEY, CHIP, OZZIE ---
New York, New York!
It's a helluva town!
--- GABEY ---
We've got one day here and not another minute
To see the famous sights!
--- OZZIE ---
We'll find the romance and danger waiting in it
Beneath the Broadway lights;
But we've hair on our chests
So what we like the best are the nights
Sights! Lights! Nights!
--- GABEY, CHIP, OZZIE ---
New York, New York, a helluva town.
The Bronx is up, but the Battery's down.
The people ride in a hole in the groun'.
New York, New York, it's a helluva town!
--- CHIP ---
Hey, Gabey! Gabey, look.
--- Unknown ---
(consulting his guidebook with reverence and excitement)
--- Unknown ---
Gabey, it says here "There are 20,000 streets in New York,
not counting MacDougal Alley the heart of Green-Witch Village,
a charming thoroughfare filled with...
--- OZZIE ---
Here we go again!
--- CHIP ---
The famous places to visit are so many,
Or so the guidebooks say.
I promised Daddy I wouldn't miss on any.
And we have just one day.
Got to see the whole town
From Yonkers on down to the Bay.
--- GABEY, CHIP, OZZIE ---
In just one day!
--- Unknown ---
New York, New York, a visitor's place,
Where no one lives on account of the pace,
But seven millions are screaming for space.
New York, New York, it's a visitor's place!
--- Unknown ---
(Two sailors enter, weaving and weary-looking -
one happy, one very glum.)
--- GABEY ---
Hey! Look who's comin' back! It's Tom and Andy!
--- OZZIE ---
Hey, Tom, Andy! Hey, fellas, how are the New York dames?
--- ANDY ---
Wonderful - I don't remember a thing!
--- TOM ---
Awful! I remember everything!
--- Unknown ---
(Tom and Andy exit.)
--- OZZIE ---
--- Unknown ---
Manhattan women are dressed in silk and satin,
Or so the fellas say;
There's just one thing that's important in Manhattan,
When you have just one day;
Gotta pick up a date...
--- CHIP ---
Maybe seven...
--- OZZIE ---
Or eight
On your way.
--- GABEY, CHIP, OZZIE ---
In just one day!
--- Unknown ---
New York, New York, a helluva town.
The Bronx is up, but the Battery's down.
The people ride in a hole in the groun'.
