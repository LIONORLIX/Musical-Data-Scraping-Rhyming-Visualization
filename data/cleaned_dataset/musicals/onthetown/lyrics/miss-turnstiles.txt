------ Miss Turnstiles ------
--- ANNOUNCER ---
Miss Turnstiles for June!
Every month, some lucky little New York miss is chosen
Miss Turnstiles for the month. She's got to be beautiful,
she's got to be just an average girl, and most important
of all she's got to ride the subway.
There are 5,683 women who ride the subway every day. And
which fortunate lassie will be chosen for the signal honor this month?
She's beautiful, brilliant, average, a typical New Yorker...
--- IVY ---
Who, me?
--- ANNOUNCER ---
Yes, you! Ivy Smith!
--- Unknown ---
(Ivy is chosen from a crowd of Manhattan girls
and adorned as Miss Turnstiles.)
--- Unknown ---
She's a home-loving girl.
But she loves high society's whirl.
She adores the Army, the Navy as well,
At poetry and polo she's swell.
--- The first of On the Town's ballets presents a satiric look at the glamorous reign of Miss Turnstiles. In front of a stage-sized blowup of her poster, we meet Ivy Smith here photographed, interviewed and wooed by the town's most eligible men. ---
--- Miss Turnstiles Dance ---
--- Ivy dances a pas de deux with a Home-loving Man, a Playboy, a Soldier, a Sailor and an Athlete - emphasizing her contradictory attributes. Folled by a pas de sept with them all. ---
--- ANNOUNCER ---
But of course at the end of each month a new Miss Turnstiles is chosen... and when that happens...
--- IVY ---
Oh, dear!
