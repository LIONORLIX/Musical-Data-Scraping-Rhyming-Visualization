Do-re-mi-do.
Mustn't be discouraged if the going is slow.

Love life must go,
If you'd be a nightingale instead of a crow.

Sing high and low,
Do-ti-la-do

And you soon will know
Anyone can go
From the lowest low
To the very highest high
If they will only sing their
Do-do-re-do.
Do-re-mi-do.

Onwards!
Do-do-re-do.
Onwards! Upwards!
Sex has to go.
Do-re-do,
Upwards and on.

Your little voice will grow
And you'll be a nightingale
Instead of a crow.
Do-do-re-do.
Don't be discouraged, babe,
If the going is slow.

Do-do-do-do-re-mi-do.

Sing it high and low.
You will be a nightingale
If you will sing your
Do-do-re-do.
Do-re-mi-do.

Sing high and low.
Do-ti-la-do.
Anyone can grow
