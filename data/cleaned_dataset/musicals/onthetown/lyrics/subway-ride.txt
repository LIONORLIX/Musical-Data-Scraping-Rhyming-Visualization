We breathe. We are waiting.
We rise. We are waiting.
We are Usher. House of Usher.
Pilasters. Quoins. Piers.
Spandrels and columns that shaft through the years.
House of Usher.
Wainscots. Stairs. Balusters. Cusps and Cornices.
Spandrels and Columns the capital years.
House of Usher.
We breathe. We are waiting
We rise. We are waiting.
We are Usher. House of Usher.
Beams. Corbels. Joists. Kingposts.
Copings and Chimney-shafts.
Ridge-ribs. Struts. Stanchions. Parapets.
Pediments. Mansards and Gargoyles.
The eaves. The dripping eaves...
Cupola. Finials. Gables. Tiles. Lead...
We breathe. We are waiting.
We rise. We are waiting.
We are Usher. House of Usher.
We are Keystone. We are Usher.
RODERICK USHER
(The Sleeper) The lady sleeps. oh, may her sleep
which is enduring so be deep!
Heaven hold her in its sacred keep!
This chamber changed for one more holy,
this bed for one of melancholy.
I pray to God that she may lie
forever with unopened eye
while the dim, sheeted ghosts go by.
My love, she sleeps. Oh, may her sleep
as it is lasting so be deep!
Soft may the worms around her creep!
Far in the forest, dim and old,
now may some tall vault enfold her;
some vault that oft hath flung its black
and winged panels fluttering back
triumphant o'er the crested palls
of her grand family funerals....
USHER MONTRESOR
I didn't mean to interrupt...
Montresor, you came!
Did you think I'd ignore your letter?
Montresor, you're here!
Come let me help you with your coat.
Sit down and rest yourself.
Oh, it's so good to see you here!
Now tell me all your news...
I see you've changed a bit, my friend...
Now won't you have a drink...
Yes, yes
but one thing at a time!
First you must tell me what...
But I expect I too have changed.
How many years could it be now
since last we said farewell?
It must be ten years
since our last meeting,
Yes, it must be ten years
since our last meeting since our last meeting.
Tell me what is wrong?
Your letter spoke
of a malady;
some desperate trial
you could not face alone...
Oh, no, you tell me all your doings!
Tell me.
Tell me
how you pass your days how you pass your days
Tell me
from the beginning. from the beginning
Tell me
everything everything
that's happened
since we went our since we went our
separate ways. separate ways.
Look at me...
I have not left these walls
these three years,
I do not dare to do so!
I am imprisoned and fear is my gaoler.
Each word I speak
seems too dangerous.
My slightest act could bring about
the very thing I fear
But fear of what?
Hush, and I shall tell you...
tell you...
USHER I shun the light,
creep in the gloom like a toad, a white worm,
tortured by the faintest gleam of sun.
I hear...
oh God, if you could only know the things I hear!
I hear the lake sucking at the walls,
I hear bats breathing
I hear the sky moan to join with the slime!
And this,
all this like thunder to me,
like thunder!
My senses scream at me:
Sight... Touch... Sight... Touch...
Sound and Taste... Sound and Scent,
All torment and claw at my sanity.
There is no hiding place for me,
for even in the quietest of my rooms,
I hear the walls in conversation;
I hear the palpitations of my heart;
I feel all that lives and does not move
and know it knows my feeling.
My only peace lies in my music
and then only because it drowns out
all other sounds and souls...
You may think that I am mad, but it is not so.
My senses reel beneath the blow of feathers falling
and more...
But no, I see you do not understand.
MONTRESOR Oh, my poor dear friend,
you must see you are not well.
I've read of this before,
I think it's called Hyperaesthesis.
I'm no doctor, but it's clear
your nerves have gone to pieces.
You need to get away,
you need a holiday,
you need a change of air!
You need an ocean cruise,
you need to be amused!
I tell you plain, this House
to me seems most unhealthy.
You're unattached, you're free to go, you're wealthy.
USHER MONTRESOR THE CHORUS
Leave this House.
Leave this House.
Leave this House
and come away.
Leave this House
I cannot!
Leave this House!
I cannot!

Here I must stay.
Here I must stay.
