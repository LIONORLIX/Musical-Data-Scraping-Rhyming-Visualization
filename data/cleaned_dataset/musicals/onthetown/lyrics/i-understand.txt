------ I Understand ------
--- PITKIN ---
When I was five my brother stole my lollipop.
My lollipop stole he.
But I didn't mutter, Damn you hide,
He needed candy more than I'd,
So instead of biting off his hand,
I just said, Goo! I understand!

When I was ten my mother trounced me with a mop.
With a mop trounc-ed she me.
But I didn't mutter, Damn your eyes,
I knew she needed exercise,
So instead of joining a gypsy band,
I just said, Mom, I understand.

At thirty a man in a car ruthlessly ran me down.
He ruthlessly down ran me.
But I didn't mutter, Damn your spleen,
For a man's a man, but a car's a machine.
So instead of stripping him of his land,
I just said, Jack, I understand.

Now I'm forty-five and I've met Claire,
We're engaged to wed.
Engaged to wed are we.
But tonight I tell you, Damn you, Claire,
You played me evil and that's not fair!
So instead of remaining calm and bland,
I hereby do not understand!!!
