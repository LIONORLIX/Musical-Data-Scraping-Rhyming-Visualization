------ Just A Housewife ------
--- Unknown ---
(Kate the Housewife)
--- Unknown ---
All I am is just a housewife
Nothing special, nothing great
What I do is kinda boring
If you'd rather, it can wait
All I am is someone's mother
All I am is someone's wife
All of which seems unimportant
All it is is
Just my life
--- Unknown ---
Do the laundry, wash the dishes
Take the dog out, clean the house
Shop for groceries, look for specials
God it sounds so, Mickey Mouse
Drop the kids off, pick the shirts up
Try to lose weight, try again
Keep the troops fed, pick their things up
Lose your patience, count to ten

All I am is just a housewife
Just a housewife, nothing great
What I do is out of fashion
What I feel is out of date
All I am is someone's mother
Right away I'm not too bright
What I do is unfulfulling
So the T.V. talk-shows tell me every night
--- Unknown ---
I don't mean to complain at all
But they make you feel like you're two feet tall
When you're just a wife
All they see are the pots and pans
And the Pepsi cans of a person's life
You're a whiz if you go to work
But you're just a jerk if you say you won't
People say that they think it's fine
If the choice is mine
But you know they don't
What I do, what I choose to do
May be dumb to you
But it's not to me
Is it dumb that they need me there?
Is it dumb to care?
Cause I do, you see
And I mean, Did ya ever think,
Really stop and think
What a job it was-
Doing all the things
That a housewife does?
--- Unknown ---
I'm afraid it's unimpressive
(All I am is someone's mother
nothing special)
What I do is
Unexciting
Take the kids here,
Take the kids there
(Mommy...
I don't mean to complain at all
(All I am is...
All I am is...)
Busy, busy...
(Everyday
All I am is...)
Like my mother...
