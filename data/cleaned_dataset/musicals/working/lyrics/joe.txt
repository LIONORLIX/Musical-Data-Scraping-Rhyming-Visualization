You wake at ten
Fold up the bed
You cook an egg
You toast some bread
You think about the day ahead
It's like I said
--- Unknown ---
You take a walk
You meet a chum
You shoot the bull
You argue some
You lose at gin
Until they come
The dirty bum
--- Unknown ---
You take a bus
You take a train
It does you good
to use your brain
You take a stroll
Down memory lane
And raisin' cane
--- Unknown ---
I remember once back in '42
we were at this fair
with these girls we knew
on this crazy ride
where you screamed or you prayed
--- Unknown ---
we could hardly walk
so we staggered down
for a candy bar
then we sat and laughed
in the penny arcade
--- Unknown ---
at six o'clock
you watch the news
you get some franks
no big to-do's
you watch a game
you take a snooze
--- Unknown ---
you change your shirt
and shine your shoes
you shoot some pool
you drink some beer
you find a pal
you bend his ear
the kinda song you never hear
and then you cheer
--- Unknown ---
i was at adance
i was seventeen
and the girl was like
from a magazine
and the lights were low
and i really mean low
--- Unknown ---
and i kissed her cheek
as we waltzed away
i remeber that
like it's yesterday
boy, was she surprised
i can hear her say:
--- Unknown ---
"joe!"
--- Unknown ---
they drive you home
from round the block
you take your cash
from out of your sock
you fix teh bed
you check the lock
