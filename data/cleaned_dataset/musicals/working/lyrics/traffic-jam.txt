------ Traffic Jam ------
--- Unknown ---
(Chorus)
Damn this traffic jam
How I hate to be late
It hurts my motor to go so slow
Damn this traffic jam
Time I get home my supper'll be cold
Damn this traffic jam
--- Unknown ---
Well I left my job about 5 o'clock
It took fifteen minutes go three blocks
Just in time to stand in line
With a freeway looking like a parking lot
--- Unknown ---
- Chorus -
--- Unknown ---
Now I almost had a heart attack
Looking in my rear view mirror
I saw myself the next car back
Looking in the rear view mirror
'Bout to have a heart attack
I said
--- Unknown ---
- Chorus -
--- Unknown ---
Now when I die I don't want no coffin
I thought about it all too often
Just strap me in behind the wheel
And bury me with my automobile
--- Unknown ---
- Chorus -
--- Unknown ---
Damn...
--- Unknown ---
Now I used to think that I was cool
Running around on fossil fuel
Until I saw what I was doing
Was driving down the road to ruin
