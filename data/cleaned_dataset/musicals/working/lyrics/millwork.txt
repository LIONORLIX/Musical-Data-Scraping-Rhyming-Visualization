------ Millwork ------
--- Unknown ---
Now my grandfather was a sailor,
He blew in off the water
My father was a farmer
I, his only daughter,
Took up with a no-good millworking man from Massachusetts
Who dies from too much whiskey
And leaves me these three faces to feed
--- Unknown ---
Millwork ain't easy; mill-work ain't hard
Millwork, it ain't nothing but an awful boring job
I'm waiting for a day dream
To take me through the morning
And put me in my coffee break
Where I can have a sandwich and remember
--- Unknown ---
Then it's me and my machine
For the rest of the morning
For the rest of the afternoon
And the rest of my life
--- Unknown ---
Now my mind begins to wander
To the days back on the farm
I can see my father smiling at me,
Swingin' on his arm
I can hear my grand-dad's stories
Of the storms out on Lake Erie
Where vessels and cargos and fortunes
And sailor's lives were lost
--- Unknown ---
Yes, but it's my life has been wasted,
And I have been the fool
To let this manufacture use my body for a tool.
I can ride home in the evening,
Staring at my hands
Swearing by my sorrow that a young girl
Ought to stand a better chance
--- Unknown ---
So may I work the mills
Just as long as I am able
And never meet the man whose
Name is on the label
--- Unknown ---
It be me and my machine
For the rest of the morning
For the rest of the afternoon
