------ Neat to Be a Newsboy ------

Newsboy
Gee, it's neat to be a newsboy
You ride your bike around the neighborhood
You get known at the stores
And outa your chores
And it pays real good
It you're eleven
Gee, I dig the world of finance
And doing business like my daddy does
And I could grow up to the Horatio Alger
Whoever he was
Oh, I like my paper route quite a bit
But there's one part that's my favorite
--- Unknown ---
You put your hands around the paper
Throw the paper in the bushes
Watch the bushes go Boin-n-n-g-g-g
You watch the bushes go Sproin-n-n-g-g-g
You watch the bushes go...
So when your head is draggin'
Cause your mommas been a-naggin'
And your sister's been annoying
Go throw the paper in the bushes
Watch the bushes go Boin-n-n-g-g-g-g-g
--- Unknown ---
Hey, it's boss tomeet the public
You learn who pays you quick and who forgets
You learn new words to swear
And things to beware
Like having debts
And german shepards
Hey, it's nifty making contacts
There's major people in half a mile
And i could grow up to be the president someday
If I practice my smile
And anytime I want to call it quits
I just think about those fringe benefits...

And Watch the bushes go
Boing...
