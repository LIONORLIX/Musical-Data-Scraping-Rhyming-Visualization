Breaker number nine big buddy

Big trucker got to have a big lie
So come on brother trucker
You got to come back Mother ohh..

Sho 'nough ashamed bout the shape Im in
Roll, roll, roll brother trucker
Im back on my wheels again
Roll, roll, roll brother trucker
Outward bound from south bend
Roll, roll, roll brother trucker

I'm running out of whites
Goddam dim them headlights
Four hours sleep in the last 2 nights
But Im gonna be alright
About half way home
Cant get to the telephone
Im hot as pistol, dry as a bone
I wonder if my babys alone

Roll, roll, roll brother trucker

Roll, roll, roll brother trucker
Turn it around and do it again
Roll, roll, roll brother trucker

Moon over new jersey
Big state police
Im in a hurry
Wont you let me go in peace
Im an independent
I aint got no teamster dough
cause the a.f.o.l. and the c.i.o.
Still dont own the road
And the only man telling me where to go
Is the man who owns my load
--- Unknown ---
And he says roll, roll, roll brother trucker
I say where and you say when
Roll, roll, roll brother trucker
Im back on my wheels again
Roll, roll, roll brother trucker
Back it on up and do it again
Roll, roll, roll brother trucker
Im back on my wheels again
