------ The World Is Mean ------
--- POLLY ---
All Im asking isn't much
Once instead of all this sadness
From a man, a little gladness
Is that asking very much?
Is that asking such a much?
--- PEACHUM ---
One right is guaranteed to everybody
To call this short unhappy life his own
To take a bit of pleasure with the shoddy
And when he asks for bread to eat, not get a stone
This human right belongs to everybody
But sad to say, it never yet has happened
That things should go the way they ought to go
Who wouldn't want a little decent treatment?
It seems that circumstance won't have it so
--- MRS. PEACHUM ---
I would gladly give to you
Anything your heart desired
Oh I swear I'd b? inspired
It would give me pl?asure too
It would give me pleasure too
--- PEACHUM ---
We crave to be more kindly than we are
Give gladly to the poor because it's right
If all are kind His Kingdom isn't far
Who wouldn't wish to bask beneath His light?
We crave to be more kindly than we are
But sad to say, the chances happen never
You have to reach up high and man is low
We'd all be glad to live in peace forever
It seems that circumstance won't have it so
--- POLLY & MRS. PEACHUM ---
Oh sad to say he tells the truth
The world is mean and man uncouth
--- PEACHUM ---
Of course I'm telling you the truth
The world is mean and man uncouth
To be aglow instead of low
But you know circumstance won't have it so
To be aglow instead of low
But you know circumstance won't have it so
--- POLLY & MRS. PEACHUM ---
And nothing much will help a lot
And you can toss it in a pot
--- PEACHUM ---
The world is mean and man uncouth
And sad to say I tell the truth
--- POLLY, MRS. PEACHUM & PEACHUM ---
It always happens that way
It always happens that way
And nothing much will help a lot
