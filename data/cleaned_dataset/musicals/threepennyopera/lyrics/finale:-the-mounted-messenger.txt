--- MESSENGER, spoken ---
Stop!
--- ENSEMBLE ---
Hark, hark, hark!
Hark, hark, hark!
--- MEN ---
Victoria's messenger riding comes
Riding comes, riding comes
--- WOMEN ---
Hark, he comes!
Hark, he comes!
--- MEN ---
Victoria's messenger riding comes
Riding comes, riding comes
--- WOMEN ---
Victoria's messenger riding comes
Riding comes, riding comes
Hark, he comes!
Hark, he comes!
--- ENSEMBLE ---
Victoria's messenger riding comes
Victoria's messenger riding comes
Victoria's messenger riding comes
Victoria's messenger riding comes
Victoria's m?ssenger riding comes
--- MESSENGER, spoken ---
In vi?w of her coronation, her Majesty has decreed
That the prisoner Macheath shall at once forthwith be freed
--- MEN, spoken ---
Hooray!
--- MESSENGER, spoken ---
Also, as of this moment, he receives the rank of Knight of the Garter, a castle at Mucking-on-the-Creek in Sussex, and an annual pension for life of ten thousand pounds 'til the day of his death.
--- MEN, spoken ---
Hooray!
--- MESSENGER, spoken ---
And to all the charming wedding couples here, the Queen presents her Royal felicitations.
--- MACHEATH ---
Reprieved! Reprieved!
Oh, I had no doubts
No, I had no doubts
As the need is sorest
So the answer comes soonest
As the need is sorest
So the answer comes soonest
--- POLLY ---
Reprieved! Reprieved!
My love Macheath has been reprieved
And I am happy
[MRS. PEACHUM]
So now the story happily has ended
If only life so easily were mended
And on our real woes a messenger descended
--- PEACHUM ---
Therefore to all, stand fast where you are standing
And lift your voices in the choral anthem
Devoted to the poorest of the poor
For in real life the ending isn't quite so fine
Victoria's messenger does not come riding often
And the reply to a kick in the pants
Is just another kick in the pants
So bless you but not too eagerly in justice
--- ENSEMBLE ---
[?]
--- BALLAD SINGER ---
Happy ending, nice and tidy
It's a rule I learned in school
Get your money every Friday
Happy endings are the rule
So divide up those in darkness
From the ones who walk in light
Light 'em up boys, there's your picture
