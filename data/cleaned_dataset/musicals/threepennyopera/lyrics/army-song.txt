------ Army Song ------
--- MACHEATH ---
Johnny joined up and Jimmy was there
--- BROWN ---
And George got a sergeant's rating
--- MACHEATH ---
Don't give your right name, the army don't care
--- BROWN ---
And the life is so fascinating
--- MACHEATH & BROWN ---
Let's all go barmy, live off the army
See the world we never saw
--- BROWN ---
If we get feeling down
--- MACHEATH ---
We wander into town
--- BROWN ---
And if the population
--- MACHEATH ---
Should greet us with indignation
--- MACHEATH & BROWN ---
We chop 'em to bits because we like our hamburgers raw!
--- MACHEATH ---
Johnny drank up 'til his gut caved in
--- BROWN ---
And Jimmy did not drink tea
--- MACHEATH ---
And George replied with a right to the chin
--- BROWN ---
For the army is just a pink tea
--- MACHEATH & BROWN ---
Let's all go barmy, liv? off the army
See the world we n?ver saw
--- BROWN ---
If we get feeling down
--- MACHEATH ---
We wander into town
--- BROWN ---
And if the population
[MACHEATH]
Should greet us with indignation
--- MACHEATH & BROWN ---
We chop 'em to bits because we like our hamburgers raw!
--- MACHEATH ---
Johnny is missing, Jimmy is dead
--- BROWN ---
And George went crazy shooting
--- MACHEATH ---
But blood is blood and red is red
--- BROWN ---
And the army is still recruiting
--- MACHEATH, BROWN & FOUR GANGSTERS ---
Let's all go barmy, live off the army
See the world we never saw
If we get feeling down
We wander into town
And if the population
Should greet us with indignation
