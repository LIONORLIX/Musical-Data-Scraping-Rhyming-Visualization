------ The Ballad of Mack the Knife ------
--- BALLAD SINGER ---
Oh, the shark has pretty teeth, dear
And he shows them pearly white
Just a jackknife has Macheath, dear
And he keeps it out of sight
--- Unknown ---
When the shark bites with his teeth, dear
Scarlet billows start to spread
Fancy gloves, though, wears Macheath, dear
So there's not a trace of red
--- Unknown ---
On the sidewalk Sunday morning
Lies a body oozing life
Someone's sneaking 'round the corner
Is the someone Mack the Knife?
--- Unknown ---
From a tugboat by the river
A cement bag's dropping down
The cement's just for the weight, dear
Bet you Mackie's back in town
--- Unknown ---
Louie Miller disappeared, dear
After drawing out his cash
And Macheath spends like a sailor
Did our boy do something rash?
--- Unknown ---
Sukey Tawdry, Jenny Diver
Polly Peachum, Lucy Brown
Oh, the line forms on the right, dears
Now that Mackie's back in town
--- Unknown ---
Oh, the shark has pretty teeth, dear
And he shows them pearly white
Just a jackknife has Macheath, dear
And he keeps it out of sight
Just a jackknife has Macheath, dear
And he keeps it
--- VOICE ---
Look, there goes Mack the Knife
--- BALLAD SINGER ---
