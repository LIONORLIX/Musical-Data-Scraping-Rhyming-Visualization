There was nothing to do on a Friday night
No one was calling my phone
The prospect of plans seemed out of sight
And I sat in my room all alone
So I booted up my computer
And I bought a new sweater online
But while browsing J-Crew
A loneliness grew
And soon I was desperate to find
--- Unknown ---
Something to pick up my mood just a bit
That`s when it happened, that`s when I got hooked
On the internet site I can`t seem to quit
That`s when I joined...
The Facebook
