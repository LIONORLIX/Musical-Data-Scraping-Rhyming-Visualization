------ Monticello ------
--- Unknown ---
Nothing ever happens in Monticello
Let`s give a hand for the land of buried dreams
Cause when you hang your hat in Monticello
You end up like your dad
And it`s really as sad as it seems
--- Unknown ---
Carol at the diner tried to be a singer
Mark still swears he`ll end up on TV
Everyone has plans for something greater
But they never leave town
They just let themselves drown
But I won`t be pulled down
Not Me
--- Unknown ---
Someday I`ll pack up my things and move on
Move on
One day
They`ll come looking for me
I`ll be gone
I`ll be gone
I`m gonna ditch this life and never return
And I won`t look back
Because I`ll finally learn
How it feels to be under a limitless sky
I`m gonna kiss Indiana goodbye
--- Unknown ---
I`ll give my two weeks notice at the Rite Aid
I`ll sell my baseball cards to make some cash
I`ll leave a note for mom that says `I love you.`
And I`ll be gone with no trace
I`ll be out of this place in a flash
I`ll start by heading west on Highway 80
Hit every Steak`n`Shake on the way
I`ll drive a couple days
Until I end up in California
Then find fortune and fame
Receive massive acclaim
They`ll wonder how I became the toast of LA
--- Unknown ---
Someday I`ll pack up my things and move on
Move on
One day
They`ll come looking for me
I`ll be gone
I`ll be gone
I`m gonna ditch this life and never return
And I won`t look back
Because I`ll finally learn
How it feels to be handed my piece of the pie
I`m gonna kiss Indiana goodbye
--- Unknown ---
I know this might sound crazy
But I`m not like other people
And though settling for less is fine for some
If I keep treading water here I nowhere Indiana
I know exactly who I will become
--- Unknown ---
Maybe this whole plan seems just a bit unrealistic
But I`m not saying I could leave today
I`ll stay a couple years
And save enough to really do this
That`s when I`ll see
What more I can be
--- Unknown ---
Someday I`ll pack up my things and move on
Move on
One day real soon they`ll come looking for me
I`ll be gone
I`ll be gone
I refuse to stay and act like it`s fine
You can keep this life
Because it sure isn`t mine
I can`t wait around until the day that I die
I won`t miss you Indiana
I`m gonna kiss you goodbye
