------ Become ------
--- GUY 1 ---
I'm nineteen and male
I play squash and racquetball
I've an allergy to grapefruit and tomatoes
My sister goes to Yale
I screwed Jen from down the hall
Over spring Break, at a beach house in Barbados
--- Unknown ---
There you go, that's my life in photos
That's what you get in a snapshot frame
There I am, in a trimmed up bio
That's who I am every night and day
--- Unknown ---
But, sometimes I feel there's something missing
Lurking inside that I can't explain
Sometimes I feel like I'm gonna crack
And I work so hard to maintain
--- Unknown ---
But still I smile because I need to look strong
And all the while I keep soldiering on
I wanna see me from where I begun
But I'm afraid to be
Who I am, who I want to become
--- GIRL 1 ---
I'm 30 and unwed
I read Cosmo all the time
And I believe a woman has the right to choose
My bedroom's painted red
And my favorite food is Thai
And I'm saving up to take a single's cruise
--- Unknown ---
Now there you go, do you understand me'
Now do you feel that you know my core'
There I am, there's my life on paper
But rip it up cuz I'm needing more
--- Unknown ---
Cuz sometimes I feel my life is ending
Before I've had the chance to chase the wind
I can't explain what or why I'm fighting
But my legs feel locked and my arms feel pinned
--- BOTH ---
But still I smile because I need to look strong
And all the while I keep soldiering on
I wanna see me from where I begun
But I'm afraid to be
Who I am, who I want to become
--- Unknown ---
Do I really wanna see'
Do I really wanna mess it all up,
To know'
Could I be living a lie'
Filled with uncertainty'
Do I wanna grow'
--- GUY 2 ---
I was popular in school
I live west of Central Park
I have a law degree but I watch TV instead
My car is out of fuel
I still get scared of the dark
And every second Monday I skip work to stay in bed
--- Unknown ---
There you are, there's a little soundbite
There goes a clip of my old disguise
Mark it down for a new best seller
A man who won't fail so he never tries
--- Unknown ---
Cuz our lives are full of expectations
Can't find what keeps me from my goals
Though I could shape the world with just my fingers
My hands are stuck, and I can't break the mold
--- ALL THREE ---
But still I smile because I need to look strong
And all the while I keep soldiering on
I wanna see me from where I begun
But I'm afraid to be
Who I am, who I want to become
--- Unknown ---
Do I really wanna see'
Do I really wanna mess it all up,
To know'
Could I be living a lie'
Filled with uncertainty'
Do I wanna grow'
--- GIRL 2 ---
I'm the life of every party
And I love to laugh out loud
I drink a little more than I probably should
I love Paul McCartney
I'm the loudest in the crowd
And I know people try their best and can usually be good
--- Unknown ---
Well here I am, in a little journal
With similar scribbles for every page
Read it all, and you'll think you get me
But, I have volumes I've left encaged
--- Unknown ---
I feel like the world doesn't wanna know me
So I decide to be someone new
Now I've kept you from getting to me
When all I want is to live the truth
--- ALL ---
But still I smile because I need to look strong
And all the while I keep soldiering on
I wanna see me from where I begun
But I'm afraid to be
Who I am, who I want to become
--- Unknown ---
Do I really wanna see'
Do I really wanna mess it all up,
To know'
Could I be living a lie'
Filled with uncertainty'
Do I wanna grow'
--- Unknown ---
But still I smile because I need to look strong
And all the while I keep soldiering on
I wanna see me from where I begun
But I'm afraid to be
Who I am, who I want to become!
Become!
Become!
