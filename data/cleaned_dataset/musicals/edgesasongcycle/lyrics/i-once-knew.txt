------ I Once Knew ------
--- Unknown ---
I once knew a woman who tried to keep going
Who made more of life than what she had been dealt
A woman who raised a city of children
Who never got back or got asked how she felt
I once knew a woman who had a laugh just like thunder
And hands that can wipe away anyone?s tears
A women?s whose life wasn?t measured by time
Who stayed the same age despite passing years
--- Unknown ---
So look bright, so look strong
Act the unbeatable part you once played
So hold tight, so hold on
Hold fast to the delicate future you made
Cause as I?m getting older
I?m finding the holes
I never wanted to see
So hold on, hold fast, hold tighter for me
--- Unknown ---
I once knew a woman who would take me to breakfast
Who taught me that I could mix ketchup with eggs
I once knew a woman who saw all my moments
Who taught me to sing and to stand on both legs
--- Unknown ---
I once knew a woman not scared to be challenged
Embracing all chances although she could fail
And when she fell down she  would always get up
I wasn?t afraid, I knew she?d prevail
--- Unknown ---
So look bright, so look strong
Act the unbeatable part you once played
So hold tight, so hold on
Hold fast to the delicate future you made
Cause as I?m getting older
I?m finding the holes
I never wanted to see
So hold on, hold fast, hold tighter for me
--- Unknown ---
I don?t have to leave I can stay by your side
What can I do so you?re able to see
That I won?t ever try without you there to catch me
So please be the woman I need you to be.
--- Unknown ---
Don?t cry, and act strong
Be the unbeatable part you once played
So just try and hold on
Everything?s fine mom, you cant be afraid
