------ Perfect ------

It's true.
I don't know enough.
Don't really get the stuff they say on CNN.
I'll work.
Get so much smarter.
I can try harder.
If I mess up, I'll try again.

People change, People grow.
We rearrange, We let things go.

I could be perfect.
I could be perfect.
Tell me what to do.
I could be perfect...for you.

Listen.
You were right.
My friends were bad for me.
Thank God you help me see how fake they are.
I know.
And look.
Just like you said I should.
I cut them out for good, I should have done that long ago.
--- Unknown ---
Now it's just you.
And it's just me.
Help me through.
Try to see...
--- Unknown ---
I can be perfect.
I can be perfect.

The other day your meeting ran too late,
I went and ate.
I just sat there on my own.
The waitor watched me as I read my book,
He gave that look like...How pathetic..she's all alone.
I don't want to be alone.
Don't let me be alone.
--- Unknown ---
No one else can take your place.
I am yours and you are mine.
So don't tell me we need space.
No don't use that fucking line.
Now you look me in the face, we are going to be fine.
--- Unknown ---
I will be perfect.
I will be perfect.
I will be perfect.
I will be perfect.
It's not hard to do.
