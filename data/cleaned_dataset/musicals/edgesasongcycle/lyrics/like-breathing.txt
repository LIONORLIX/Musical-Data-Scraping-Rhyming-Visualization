------ Like Breathing ------
--- Unknown ---
You start off with a question. (Do I really wanna see?)
You wonder, and you doubt. (Do I really wanna know?)
You know there's something greater, (Do I wanna grow?)
But you can't figure out what road you'd take to get there.
Or where this 'there' might be.
But you're ready to discover,
'Cause you really wanna see.
--- Unknown ---
You open up your eyes,
Study and review, what you do.
You force yourself to grow.
Let that go.
--- Unknown ---
Let it be like breathing.
It could be like breathing.
Let it be like breathing.
--- Unknown ---
Take away the questions,
Cover up my eyes.
Help me notice beauty.
Let denim colored skies shower me with sunlight.
Let warmth fall down like rain.
--- Unknown ---
Render me unable.
To possibly explain.
I want to search for words, and not know what to say (that's okay)
I don't need to know,
Let that go.
--- Unknown ---
Let it be like breathing.
It could be like breathing.
Let it be like breathing.
--- Unknown ---
Let go of feeling you are anything but beautiful.
Let go of thinking you can't do this on your own.
Let go of being scared that you might not be good enough.
Let go of saying you were meant to be alone.

Ah ah ah,
Ah ah ah,
Ah ah ah,
Ah ah ah ah,
Ah ah ah,
Ah ah ah,
--- Unknown ---
I'm not afraid!
I'm not afraid!
I'm not afraid!
I'm not afraid!
--- Unknown ---
To be...
Who I am, who I want to become.
Become.
Become.
Become, become, become, become.
