------ The Graveyard ------
--- YOUNG JANE ---
Helen, I have brought you a lily today
For the roses were frail
And the petals fell away
The morning mist has kissed your grave
Rest now in sleep
Our secrets will keep
Till we speak again tomorrow
When I lay myself down to sleep tonight
I pray I might
Know why God has tempered judgment
But with mercy
But with sorrow
--- JANE & YOUNG JANE ---
Let the world forsake me
Let them do their worst, I will
Withstand it all
They will not break me
--- BOTH JANES & ENSEMBLE ---
There is another world that watches us
I'm not afraid
The angels know when we have sinned
Or we have been betrayed
--- MISS SCRATCHERD ---
Jane Eyre!
--- YOUNG JANE ---
Yes, Miss Scratcherd.
--- MISS SCRATCHERD ---
Get to your class! You're late as usual.
--- YOUNG JANE ---
Yes, Miss.
--- MISS SCRATCHERD ---
Miserable little child!
--- JANE & ENSEMBLE ---
As I lay myself down to sleep tonight
I pray I might
Be granted strength to see
The spark of heaven's guiding light
--- JANE ---
My rebellion waits
The silent cry my spirit sings
Goes far beyond these gates
