------ The Pledge ------
--- JANE ---
Are you ill, sir?
--- ROCHESTER ---
Jane, I've been dealt a blow - I've been dealt a blow, Jane.
--- JANE ---
What is it, sir?
--- ROCHESTER ---
Will you ease my trouble?
--- JANE ---
If you tell me how
--- ROCHESTER ---
Once you offered your sweet shoulder
--- JANE ---
You can have it now
Please take my arm, sir
Let me comfort you
--- ROCHESTER ---
Jane, I wish that we were far away
On a quiet island in a distant country
Living day to day
Jane, what would you do?
If all the people that you see
Denounced my name and spat at me?
--- JANE ---
I would comfort you...
--- ROCHESTER ---
Oh, Jane, what would you do?
If there was something I had done
To make them leave me one by one?
--- JANE ---
I would never lose faith
I would never lose heart
I would stand by your side
They could slander your name
They could brand you with shame
But so your heart be pure
