------ Sirens ------
--- ROCHESTER ---
Damn the passion, damn the skies
Damn the light that's in her eyes
I know too well where it has led before
She saves me but I can't be saved
Frees me but I'm still enslaved
Now I battle what I most adore
Oh, let me sail away
And make this vow
That what my heart wants
I will not allow
For as sirens call the sailors
She calls me now
--- JANE ---
God save him if he can be saved
Free him if his soul's enslaved
Clear the clouded refuge of his mind
Quell his anger, calm his scorn
Let his spirit be reborn
Help him gather sight where he is blind
--- ROCHESTER ---
O let me sail away
Where I won't hear her voice
Where I am blind and free
For as sirens call the sailors
She calls to me
--- JANE ---
For I believe
The ghosts of shame
That haunt his past
Will rest at last
The pain will ceaseI'll bring him peace
--- ROCHESTER ---
I cannot stand another knock
My body dashed upon the rocky shore
The darkness that invades my soul
It sucks my blood, it takes control
Well, I will not endure it anymore
--- ROCHESTER ---
Damn the passion, damn the skies
Damn the light that's in her eyesI know too well where it has led before
She saves me but I can't be saved
Frees me but I'm still enslaved
Now I battle what I most adore Oh, let me sail away
Get lost at sea
Where I won't hear her voice
Where I am blind and free
For as sirens call the sailors
She calls me now
--- JANE ---
I cannot sleep
I cannot breathe
I cry his tears
I sense the secrets of his past
I feel his fears
And I believe
The ghosts of shame
That haunt his past
Will rest at last
The pain will cease
I'll bring him peace
--- THE FIGURE ---
Aaaah!
--- ROCHESTER ---
She calls to me
She calls to me
--- THE FIGURE ---
Aaaah!
--- JANE ---
Heal his pain
Calm his sea
And let him sail on gentler waters
