------ Things Beyond This Earth ------
--- ENSEMBLE ---
Sympathies exist
Presentiments and signs
That baffle our mortal comprehension
To dream or to see
Or to feel or to hear
What seems not to be there
But such things exist
Things beyond this earth
Things beyond our sacred
Thoughts of heaven
These are the things that reason defies
