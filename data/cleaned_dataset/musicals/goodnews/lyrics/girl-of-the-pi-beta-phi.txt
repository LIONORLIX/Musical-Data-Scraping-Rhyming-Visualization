*Singing*
Happy are the days we spend together,
In pi beta phi,
All our hearts are lighter than a feather,
As the years go by.
--- Unknown ---
Parting has to come with graduation,
Parting doesn`t mean a separation,
For our hearts are bound as with a tether,
To pi beta phi.
--- Unknown ---
Here, and there, and everywhere,
There`s a girl of the pi beta phi,
Longing for the days of your,
That she knew in the Pi beta Phi.
--- Unknown ---
Perhaps a daughter on her knee,
Will sing this lullaby,
I hope and pray she?ll be someday,
A beautiful girl,
A dutiful girl,
And a girl of the pi beta phi.
--- Unknown ---
*speaks*
Pi Phi girls don`t mope!
