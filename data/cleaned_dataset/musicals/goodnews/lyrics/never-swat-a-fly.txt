------ Never Swat a Fly ------
--- FRANK ALBERTSON ---
Love has made me tender
I now appreciate
Ev'ry little creature on this Earth
That has a mate
--- Unknown ---
Once I hated crickets
I couldn't stand a bee
Now here is a motto
That I follow faithfully
--- Unknown ---
Never swat a fly
He may love another fly
He may sit with her and sigh
The way I do with you
--- Unknown ---
Never harm a flea
He may have a favourite she
That he bounces on his knee
The way I do with you
--- Unknown ---
Never stop a bee
If he is going anywhere
For you may be concluding
Some terrific love affair, be careful
--- Unknown ---
Don't step on an ant
In the middle of a pant
He may want to, but he can't
The way I do with you
--- MARJORIE WHITE ---
I'm the same as you are
Tears come to my eyes
When I see Professors chasing
Helpless butterflies
--- Unknown ---
Fishermen are hateful
They lead a wicked life
Why, ev'ry day they seperate
The husband from his wife
--- Unknown ---
Never swat a fly
He may love another fly
He may sit with her and sigh
The way I do with you
--- Unknown ---
Never spray a nit
With a great big can of Flit
He may think some nit has it
The way I do with you
--- Unknown ---
Never stop a moth
As he is gliding through the air
He may have a date
In someone's flannel underwear, be careful
--- Unknown ---
Don't you dare to slay
Two skeeters while they play
They may want to make hey-hey
