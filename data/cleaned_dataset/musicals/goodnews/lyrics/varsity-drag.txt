------ Varsity Drag ------
--- Babe ---
Hey everybody! What's goin' on here?
We can't let school get us depressed,
after all the reason we're in college is to have fun, right?
--- Unknown ---
We've always thought
Knowledge was naught
We should be taught
To dance!
Right here in Tait
We're up-to-date
We teach a great
New dance!
Don't think that I brag
I speak of the drag!
--- Unknown ---
Why should a chic
Learn how to speak
Latin and Greek
Badly?
Give 'em a neat
Motto complete
Say it with feet
Glady!
--- Unknown ---
First lesson right now
You'll love it and how!
--- Guys ---
You'll love it!
--- Babe ---
Here is the drag
See how it goes
Down on your heels
Up on your toes
That&#8217;s the way to do the varsity drag!
--- Unknown ---
It's hotter than hot!
Newer than new!
Meaner than mean!
Bluer than blue!
Gets as much applause as waving the flag!
--- Unknown ---
You can pass
Many a class
Whether you're dumb or wise
If you all answer the call
When your professor cries
Everybody!
Down on your heels
Up on your toes
Stay after school
Learn how it goes
Everybody do the varsity drag!
--- Girls ---
Here is the drag
See how it goes
Down on your heels
Up on your toes
That&#8217;s the way to do the varsity drag!
--- Babe ---
Its hotter than hotter than hot!
Newer than newer than new!
Meaner than meaner than mean!
Bluer than bluer than blue!
--- Ensemble ---
Gets as much applause as waving the flag!
--- Unknown ---
You can pass many a class
Whether you're dumb or wise
--- Babe ---
If you all answer the call
When your professor cries
--- Ensemble ---
Everybody!
--- Unknown ---
Down on your heels!
Up on your toes!
Say goodbye to blues and do the
Drag!
