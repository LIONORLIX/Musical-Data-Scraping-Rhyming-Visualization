------ Best Things in Life Are Free ------
--- Unknown ---
There are so many kinds of riches,
and only one of them is gold!
The wealth you miss, remember this:
Worthwhile things cannot be bought or sold...
--- Unknown ---
The moon belongs to everyone,
The best things in life are free,
The stars belong to everyone,
they gleam they're for you and me.
--- Unknown ---
The flowers in spring,
The robins that sing,
The sunbeams that shine:
They're yours, they're mine.
--- Unknown ---
And love can come to everyone,
