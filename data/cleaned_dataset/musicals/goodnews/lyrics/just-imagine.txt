------ Just Imagine ------
--- Unknown ---
I thought I found my ideal man,
I always knew he'd arrive,
Though he's a true hard to appeal man,
He doesn't know I'm alive,
But I wont spend my time in grieving,
I've learned the trick of make believing.
--- Unknown ---
Just imagine that he loves me dearly,
Jut imagine I am his sincerely,
I'm pretending that hes sending,
Love notes ending 'I love you'.
--- Unknown ---
Seems that hes there,
As the day is closing,
On his knees there,
I hear him proposing,
He's not present,
Still its pleasant,
To just imagine its true.
--- Unknown ---
He's not present,
Still its pleasant,
To just imagine that its true.
