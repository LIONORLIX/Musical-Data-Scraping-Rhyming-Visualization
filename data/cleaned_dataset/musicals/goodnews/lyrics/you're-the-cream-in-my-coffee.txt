------ You're the Cream in My Coffee ------
--- Unknown ---
I'm not a poet,
How well i know it,
I've never been a raver,
But when i speak of you,
I rave a bit, its true.
--- Unknown ---
I'm wild about you,
I'm lost without you,
You give my life its flavor,
What sugar does for tea,
Thats what you do for me.
--- Unknown ---
You're the cream in my coffee,
You're the salt in my stew
You will always be my necessity,
I'd be lost without you.
--- Unknown ---
You're the starch in my collar,
You're the lace in my shoe
You will always be my necessity,
I'd be lost without you.
--- Unknown ---
Most girls tell love tales,
And each phrase dovetails
You've heard each known way,
This way is my own way:
--- Unknown ---
You're the sail of my loveboat,
You're the captain and crew,
You will always be my necessity
I'd be lost without you.
--- Unknown ---
You're the cream in my coffee,
You're the salt in my stew
You will always be my necessity,
I'd be lost without you.
--- Unknown ---
You will always be my necessity,
I'd be lost without you.
--- Unknown ---
You will always be my necessity,
I'd be lost without you.
--- Unknown ---
You are my life savor,
You bring out that certain flavor,
So dear, this is clear, dear,
You're my worcestershire, dear!
--- Unknown ---
You're the sail in my loveboat,
You're the captain and crew,
You will always be my necessity,
I'd be lost without you.
--- Unknown ---
You will always be my necessity
I'd be lost without you.
You
Sweet, Adorable You
