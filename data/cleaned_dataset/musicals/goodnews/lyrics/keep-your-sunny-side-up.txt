------ Keep Your Sunny Side Up ------
--- Unknown ---
There's one thing to think of when you're blue,
There are others around much worse off than you!
If a load of troubles should arrive,
Laugh and say, It's great to be alive!;
--- Unknown ---
And keep your sunny side up, up,
Hide the side that gets blue.
If you have nine sons in a row,
Baseball teams make money, you know!
--- Unknown ---
Keep your funny side up, up,
Let your laughter come through, do!
Stand up on your legs,
Be like two fried eggs,
Keep your sunny side up!
--- Unknown ---
Life can be a pleasure or a pain,
Good or bad, successful or in vain;
Happiness is just a point of view,
If you have it here's the thing to do;
--- Unknown ---
Keep your sunny side up, up,
Drown a frown with a smile.
If you think it's raining for you,
Just remember, others are blue.
--- Unknown ---
Always look for the bright side,
Start the day on the right side;
You'll find life worthwhile,
Learn to wear a smile,
