------ You Walk With Me ------
--- Unknown ---
Malcolm
Is is the wind
Over my shoulder?
Is it the wind that I hear gently whispering
Are you alone there in the valley?
No, not alone for you walk, you walk with me
--- Unknown ---
Is it the wind there over my shoulder?
Is it your voice calling quietly?
Over the hilltop, down in the valley
Never alone for you walk with me
--- Unknown ---
When evening falls
And the air gets colder
When shadows cover the road I am following
Will I be along there in the darkness?
No, not alone, not alone
And I'll never be...

Ethan
Never alone, you are walking
You're walking with me

Malcolm & Ethan
Is it the wind there, over my shoulder?
Is it your voice calling quietly?
Over the hilltop, down in the valley
Never alone for you walk with me
Over the hilltop, down in the valley
Never alone for you walk with me
