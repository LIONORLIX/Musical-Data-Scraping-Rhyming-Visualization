------ Big-Ass Rock ------

Jerry
Let's find a rock
I mean a big-ass rock
Or maybe something like
A cinder block is better
I'll hoist it up
And drop it on your face, my buddy
--- Unknown ---
And just before the lights go out
You'll see my smile and you'll know
You've got a friend
With a rock
Who cares
I mean a big-ass rock
--- Unknown ---
Dave
Or rope
I got some quality rope
Made for a man who's devoid of hope
Like you are, my buddy
Michael -
--- Unknown ---
Malcolm
Unh, that's Malcolm.
--- Unknown ---
Dave
Malcolm. Right!
--- Unknown ---
And I won't leave you swinging there
Twitching like a fish while you claw the air
I'll grab your feet
And pal o' mine
I'll pull real hard
And snap your spinal cord
--- Unknown ---
Jerry
The world is cold whn you're alone and
They ignore you
But don't kill yourself
--- Unknown ---
Jerry & Dave
We'll do it for you
You've got a friend
--- Unknown ---
Dave
You know, I asked a guy once if he'd mind putting me in a barrel
and sending me over the falls.
You know what the son of a bitch said? Drop dead, asshole.
--- Unknown ---
Jerry
People are pricks. I asked this guy to take his air compressor
and drill me with a six-inch nail right through the eye...
--- Unknown ---
Dave
What'd he say?
--- Unknown ---
Jerry
I'm low on nails.
--- Unknown ---
Dave
People are selfish pricks.
--- Unknown ---
Jerry
Another time, now get this,
I just lay down in front of a steam roller and asked the guy just to proceed,
you know, business as usual, and just squash me like a bug.
--- Unknown ---
Dave
That's a good way to go, Jer, the ol' bug squash.
We could tie a plastic laundry bag over his head.
--- Unknown ---
Jerry
Naw, that's such a wimp suicide.
--- Unknown ---
Malcolm
I stuck my finger in a socket once. It hurt real bad...but it didn't kill me.
--- Unknown ---
Jerry
Malcolm, stay out of this.
--- Unknown ---
Malcolm
I've got a friend
Like Carole King
Or was it Carly Simon
Used to sing?
I always get those two confused
But anyway -
--- Unknown ---
I turned around
And suddenly
I'm not alone
It ain't just me
I'm like a player on the team
I'm part of the gang...
A member of the club Jerry & Dave
Player on our team
Part of the gang
Welcome to the club
--- Unknown ---
Dave
Oo ... let's get a club
--- Unknown ---
Jerry
I like the big-ass rock
--- Unknown ---
Dave
Naw, one good swing and
I'll clean his clock forever
--- Unknown ---
Jerry
Let gravity do the work!
--- Unknown ---
Dave
It's a man's way to die, Mikey.
--- Unknown ---
Jerry
Malcolm!
--- Unknown ---
Malcolm
I got friends
--- Unknown ---
Oo...
I've got friends
--- Unknown ---
Oo...
--- Unknown ---
Dave & Jerry
Friends who will
Love you like a maniac
And lead you like a lamb
To the railroad track
And tie you down
--- Unknown ---
Or tickle your wrist
With a single-edge razor
Or buy you a beer with
A Draino chaser
Or dump you in the
River with a rock
--- Unknown ---
Malcolm
A big-ass rock
--- Unknown ---
Jerry
Here's a nice one right over here
--- Unknown ---
Dave
Can I give you a hand with that? It looks heavy.
--- Unknown ---
Jerry
No Dave
It's ain't heavy...he's my friend
--- Unknown ---
Dave
