Back at home my libido is asleep
Nothing stirring up the batter
Now I know all I needed was a heap
O' dancing beefcake on a platter
--- Unknown ---

Let's get sweaty and
Let's get mean
Fire up the burner -

Georgie
Work all day, I come home and he's all pissed
It's a wallow-in-the-mudfest
Now I know all I need to clear the system's
Just a raunchy little studfest
--- Unknown ---
God bless their little G-strings!
--- Unknown ---
All that music and all that beat
Who's feeling funny -

All that meat

On that motorcycle cop

Or G.I. Joe with the military jock
I'd give a hundred bucks to see what's inside it

All that music and all that beat
Making me dizzy
It's a woman's world
All those men moving
all that meat

Well it might be the men's room
