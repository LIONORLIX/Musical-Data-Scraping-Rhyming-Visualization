------ Michael Jordan's Ball ------
--- Unknown ---
Jerry
When Michael's got the basketball
It's Michael's house from wall to wall
You hear that name, it's a diff'rent game
When it's Michael Jordan's ball
--- Unknown ---
When it's Michael's ball you're dead, you're through
'Cause Michael takes the game to you
He's in your face, you lost the race
It's Michael Jordan's ball
--- Unknown ---
The fake, the spin
The drive and then he's in the paint
The pump, the jump, and he's up in the air
Like a goddamn saint!
--- Unknown ---
When Micheal bolts and he penetrates
You feel the volts he generates
He's slick as soap, he's King, he's Pope
He's Michael Friggin' Jordan!
--- Unknown ---
Jerry & Men
You fake, you spin, you drive
And then you're in the paint
You pump, you jump, and you're up there!
--- Unknown ---
And you're through the roof
And you're in the zone
Two-hundred-proof testosterone
You're bad, you're hot, you're almost God!
--- Unknown ---
Jerry
