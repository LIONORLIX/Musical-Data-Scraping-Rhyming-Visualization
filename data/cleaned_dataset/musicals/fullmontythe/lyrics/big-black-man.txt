Horse
When I was just a little nipper
Daddy told me Son
That thing there underneath your zipper
Can be lots of fun
When you get a little older
You'll understand
That every woman in the world loves
A big black man.
--- Unknown ---
Now I ain't elite, I ain't no man of means
But I got mean feet and my daddy's genes
You just meet me once and you'll understand
There ain't nothing in the world like
A big black man
--- Unknown ---
Cause I'm big and I'm proud
Singing out loud
Dancing it since the day I was born
Who's got the tools?
Who breaks the rules?
'Git back
And let a man do the popcorn!
--- Unknown ---
I'm what your sister and your mother's
Always thinking of
They put my picture on the cover
Of the book of love
Never need a line
I don't need no plan
'Cause there ain't nothin in the world like a -
Here I go,
Now hit me!
Hit me twice!
Hit me three times!
--- Unknown ---
I do the monkey
The mashed potatoes
I do the jerk
Now watch me work!

You can look up and down
All over town
Ask anybody
Ask all around
Who knows the grooves?
Who busta' moves?
I got the...
And the...
And the...

Horse & Jerry
I'm/He's what your sister and your mama's
Always thinking of
I/You take up eight whole chapters
In the book of love
It's a long low load with a deep dark tan
There ain't nothing in the world
Like a big black man
