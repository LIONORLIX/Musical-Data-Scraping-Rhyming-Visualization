------ There Will Be Sun ------
--- Unknown ---
I was born in a Puxatawney dawn
At sunrise on a summer's day
And I learnt me a saying that folks round here always say
--- Unknown ---
Who can curse, cast spells or cry
Offer your prayers to the unfeeling sky
Spring will arrive when the winter is done
And if it's not tomorrow then tomorrow or tomorrow there will be sun
--- Unknown ---
Tomorrow spring will come and then
There will be blue skies my friend
Bright eyes and laughter
--- Unknown ---
Tomorrow there will be sun
But if not tomorrow perhaps the day after
--- Unknown ---
Oh if I could I'd will these clouds away my love
I'd wave my hand, reveal the stars
--- Unknown ---
Oh if I could I'd hold the tide at bay my love
But clouds will come and tides will turn
--- Unknown ---
Tomorrow spring will come and then
There will be blue skies my friend
Bright eyes and laughter
--- Unknown ---
Tomorrow there will be sun
