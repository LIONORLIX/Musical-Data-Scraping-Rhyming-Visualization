------ Night Will Come ------
--- Unknown ---
On and on and on you stumble
Towards the evening sun
She waits for you with open arms
You stare right through her
--- Unknown ---
On and on you fall towards her
Cold embracing shadow doorway
Offers nothing still she draws you ever to her
--- Unknown ---
On and on and on you stumble towards the sinking sun
Turn a blind eye fight or run
Rest assured the night will come
--- Unknown ---
On and on you grasp and guess
And search for patterns in the mess
Of what has been and what is left
To yet endure
--- Unknown ---
The jester shrugs and plays his part
The fever fall see only dark
The pious with their hope filled hearts sing hallelujah
--- Unknown ---
On and on and on you stumble towards the cooling sun
Turn a blind eye fight or run
Rest assured the night will come
--- Unknown ---
All the love and all the gold
All you've built and all you've sold
All the power you may hold
You won't evade her
--- Unknown ---
All the steel and all the bricks
All the math and magic tricks
All the carrots all the sticks
Will not dissuade her
--- Unknown ---
On and on and on you stumble towards the fading sun
Turn a blind eye fight or run
Rest assured the night will come
Rest assured the night will come
--- Unknown ---
As for that the rest is just a test of your endurance
You've gotta love life
You've gotta live life
You've gotta love life
