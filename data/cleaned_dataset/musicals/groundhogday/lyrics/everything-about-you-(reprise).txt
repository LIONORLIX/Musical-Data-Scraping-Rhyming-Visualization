------ Everything About You (Reprise) ------
--- PHIL ---
And you like Voltaire
And The Wind in the Willows
And when you smile you get this little crease in your nose
And I know that you think I am shallow
But if you knew how deep my shallowness goes,
You'd be shocked
And your toes go numb because you wear inappropriate socks
I know everything
