------ Nobody Cares ------
--- Unknown ---
I wake up hung over
I go to bed smashed
Like an alcoholic hamster
On one of them little wheelie things
--- Unknown ---
Every evening the same
Every morning the pain
I start drinking at 10
And by noon I'm not feeling things
--- Unknown ---
And nobody cares what I'm talking about
Just swallow it man
Just swallow it
Your opinions or your vomit
Either way they don't want it
--- Unknown ---
(What's your point, what is your point)
And I think I had a point there
But the point is it don't matter
Cause it's pointless having points anyway, cause
--- Unknown ---
Nobody cares what I say
Nobody cares what I do
What's the point of bothering if no-one else is bothered
I was born in this town and I'm gonna die here too
--- Unknown ---
I wake with a headache
I take a piss I often miss
I often get a little bit on the floor
--- Unknown ---
I eat a piece of toast
That I found toasted in the toaster
Then I goes to get my jacket by the rack by the back door
--- Unknown ---
And then I get into my truck
I drive a block to Ralphy's shop
It's always shut he picks me up
And drives us up to running rock (?)
--- Unknown ---
And shoot some cans and crack some cans
And shoot the breeze about the weather
Or a sports team or a car
And after that the bar
--- Unknown ---
Nobody cares what I say
Nobody cares what I do
What's the point of bothering if no-one else is bothered
I was born in this town and I'm gonna die here too
--- Unknown ---
I wake with a headache
I take a piss I often miss
I often get a little bit on the floor
--- Unknown ---
I sometimes try to clean
The mess I makes from my mistakes
But for whose sakes
am I making all this 'F'ing effort for
--- Unknown ---
I wake up each morning
In the same damn day
There seems to be jack shit
That I can do or say
I've got no voice I've got no vote
I've got no way to change a goddamn thing
--- Unknown ---
(I think that's the pigs)
Who gives a fig
--- Unknown ---
Nobody cares what I do
Nobody cares about my life
Utterly uninfluential
No regrets and no potential
Every turn inconsequential
Yeehaw let's drive
--- Unknown ---
Nobody cares what I say
Nobody cares about my life
Utterly uninstrumental
No insurance, no intent
Ok well that's nice
--- Unknown ---
And I'm not sure what the point is
But the point is it don't matter
Point is it don't matter, cause
--- Unknown ---
Nobody cares what I do
Nobody cares about my life
Utterly uninfluential
No regrets and no potential
Every turn inconsequential
--- Unknown ---
And I'm not sure what the point is
But the point is it don't matter
Not sure what the point is
Point is it don't matter cause
--- Unknown ---
Nobody cares what I do
Nobody cares about my life
Utterly uninfluential
No regrets and no potential
Every turn inconsequential
--- Unknown ---
Utterly repercussion free
--- Unknown ---
No consequence at all
