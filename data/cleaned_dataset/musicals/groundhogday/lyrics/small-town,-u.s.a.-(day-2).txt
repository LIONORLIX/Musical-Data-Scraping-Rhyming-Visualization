All the meteorologists the world has ever known
Cannot match this little guy's uncanny skill

February second, first remote broadcast
GHD in Punx, PA
Working with Phil Connors
They all told me he would be an asshole ... and he is
I mean, he acts kinda asshole-ish, still
I think he might be... mentally ill
--- CHORUS ---
Tomorrow spring will come (spring will come)
There will be blue skies my friend
Bright eyes and laughter
Tomorrow there will be sun (there will be sun)
But if not tomorrow perhaps the day after
--- RITA ---
Unexpected weather
Seems we're staying here for another night
Which is, kind of fine
