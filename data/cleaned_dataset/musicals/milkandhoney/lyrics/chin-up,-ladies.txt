------ Chin Up, Ladies ------
--- Unknown ---
Chin up, Ladies,
Look around the horizon!
Head high, Ladies,
Don't give up the ship!
Look for the silver lining!
You gotta go on with the show
Climb ev'ry mountain
To find your Mr. Snow
And always hip-hop, Ladies,
There's a bright light tomorrow
Stiff upper lip up, Ladies!
Do or die is the plan
Don't ever be discouraged,
Don't ever be perplexed,
There's always another country
Russia or may be next
So keep your chin up, Ladies!
Somewhere over the rainbow
There's a man!

Stiff upper lip up, Ladies!
Do or die is the plan!
When the trip is over
To prove that we were here
We'd like to carry home
A six-foot souvenir!
So keep your chin up, Ladies!
Somewhere over the rainbow
There's a man!
Somewhere over the rainbow
