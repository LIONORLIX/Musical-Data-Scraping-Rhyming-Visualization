------ That Was Yesterday ------
--- Unknown ---
That plan of mine had of tomorrow solved
For I was fine
If I didn't have to get involved.
But that was yesterday,
That yesterday,
And it's gone,
It's over and it's done;
For with you my mood strikes an attitude,
That's in competition with the sun,
For when my hair was up,
My morale was down,
I was dull and colorless and gray;
But what's past is past,
I've come home at last,
Where you are,
Tomorrow is,
How far tomorrow is from yesterday.
But that was yesterday,
That yesterday,
But my equilibrium returned;
And there's not a chance of a backward glance
Over all the bridges that I've burned.
For I was someone else in some other time,
I was sev'ral millions miles away;
But I'm back and fine,
With your hand in mine
And I'll stay the way I am,
How far away I am from yesterday.

But that was yesterday,
Only was yesterday
But her equilibrium returned;
And there's not a chance of a backward glance
Over all the bridges that she's burned.

She was sev'ral millions miles away;

(You've)I've come home at last,
