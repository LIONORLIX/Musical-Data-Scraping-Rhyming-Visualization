------ There's No Reason In The World ------
--- Unknown ---
There's no reason in the world
Why you should even look at anyone like me;
But I'm so glad you did,
So glad you did,
Although I don't know what there was to see.
And there's no reason in the world
For you to be here now
And watch the days go by;
But I'm so glad you are,
So very glad you are,
Although I must admit I don't see why.
For there are wiser men and younger men,
I wouldn't blame you if you walked away;
But I feel wiser now and younger now
And so with all my heart I ask you,
Stay.
For we have so much more to see
And so much more to say
And so much more to do;
I think you ought to know
If I never let you go,
That I'd have ev'ry reason in the world,
You!
--- Unknown ---
For I feel suddenly alive,
Aware that I've been touched
By something warm and new;
I think you ought to know
If I never let you go,
That I'd have ev'ry reason in the world,
You!
--- ALTERNATE LYRICS ---
There's no reason in the world,
No reason in the world
To feel the way I feel;
We smiled and said hello,
A few short weeks ago,
And somehow not another thing seems real.
And there's no reason in the world
For me to be here now
Behaving like a child;
But did you ever see
The way he pampers me,
And makes me smile a smile I've never smiled?
There may be wiser men and younger men,
And now with more important things to say;
But there's no kinder man or warmer man
He touches me and reason runs away.
Why should this lovely way he makes me feel
Be something that the world will not allow;
And yet this much I know
If I never let him go,
I would have ev'ry reason in the world,
