------ As Simple As That ------
--- Unknown ---
You need a home where the world is welcome inside
You need a real home not just some place to hide
As so what good it would be if you should stay with me
When I can never build you that home you need
--- Unknown ---
-I know all of that and I thought it all true
But that home that I need
And that place in the world is you
If you're here,
Then I'm here,
It's really as simple as that.
--- Unknown ---
If it's your home,
It's my home;
My world is where you are,
Wherever we two are.
Don't ask me to leave you,
For this is the answer I'll give.
If you're here,
Then I'm here,
I'm with you as long as I live;
It's as simple as that.
