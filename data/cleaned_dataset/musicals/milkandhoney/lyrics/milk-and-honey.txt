------ Milk and Honey ------
--- Unknown ---
This is the land of Milk and Honey
This is the land of sun and song and
This is the world of good and plenty
Humble and proud and young and strong and
This is the place where the hopes of the homeless
and the dreams of the lost combine
This is the land that heaven blessed and
This lovely land is mine

What if the earth is dry and barren
What if the morning sun is mean to us for
This is a state of mind we live in
We want it green and so it's green to us for
When you have wonderful plans for tomorrow
Somehow even today looks fine so
What if it's rock and dust and sand,
For this lovely land is mine
This lovely land is mine.
This lovely land is mine.
This lovely land is mine.
