------ Like a Young Man ------
--- Unknown ---
Like a young man
With a young dream
You will hear me
Laughing at time
I howl the desert in the morning
With the power of a boy
Got to border if I have to
In the blaze of the sun
I can handle the gun like a toy
I'll make grain grow
Out of nowhere
Till the gray sun turns into gold
Like a young man
Who's young forever
I swear I'll never
Grow old
--- Unknown ---
I'll build her a house
In the middle of the desert
I'll give her a young hand to hold
I will make ev'ry day
An exciting new adventure
And I'll never grow old!

(Like a young man)
Like a young man
With a young dream
You will hear me
Laughing at time
I howl the desert in the morning
With the power of a boy
Got to border if I have to
In the blaze of the sun
I can handle the gun like a toy
I'll make grain grow
Out of nowhere
Till the gray sun turns into gold
Like a young man
Who's young forever
I swear I'll never
