------ The Wedding ------
--- OCHESTRA and CHORUS ---
Let's not waste a moment,
Let's not lose a day; (There's no reason in the world,
No reason in the world)
There's a short forever,
Not too far away. (There's no reason in the world,
Why I should stay
And ev'ry reason I should go)
--- Unknown ---
We don't have to hear the clock remind us
That there's more than half of life behind us,
Let's not waste a moment,
Oh, look, another moment's gone!
Look, another moment's gone!
