------ Empty Pockets Filled With Love ------
--- 1 ---
Empty pockets but a heart full of love
A heart full of love for you
--- Unknown ---
Cash not any, not one red penny
But kisses many for you
--- Unknown ---
Empty pockets but a heart beating fast
As fast as the stars above
--- Unknown ---
Please say that you'll get by with just a guy
With empty pockets filled with love
--- 2 ---
You can't eat love, you can't drink love
You can't wear love like you would a gown
--- Unknown ---
I trust love but just love
Won't pay for caviar
Won't buy that motor car
Or a house in town
--- Unknown ---
You can't spend love, you can't lend love
You must end love when the chips are down
--- Unknown ---
Love flies out the window when there's nothing to eat
Nothing to drink, nothing to wear but a frown
