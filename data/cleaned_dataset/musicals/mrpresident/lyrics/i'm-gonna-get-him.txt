------ I'm Gonna Get Him ------
--- Verse: ---
When I was a kid
And I wanted a doll I got it
Don't ask how I did but when I was a kid
And I wanted a doll I got it
I carefully laid out a plan
When I were a kid 'twas a doll
And now it's a man
--- 1st refrain: ---
I'm gonna get him, I'm gonna get him
Instead of giving up and throwing in the towel
--- Unknown ---
I'm gonna keep on fighting fair or foul
Until I get him, I'm gonna get him
--- Unknown ---
I'm gonna wear my jewels and my ermine wrap
And if I have to drop my shoulder strap
I'm gonna get him, I'm gonna get him
--- Unknown ---
And when I've got him where I think he oughta be
I'm gonna love him, love him
My mission in life will be to love him until he loves me
--- 2nd refrain: ---
I'm gonna get him, I'm gonna get him
I'll back him in a corner till he squirms and twists
--- Unknown ---
And if I must put handcuffs on his wrists
I'm gonna get him, I'm gonna get him
--- Unknown ---
He'll know the facts of life and when he understands
I'll put a shotgun in my father's hands
And that'll get him, I'm gonna get him
--- Unknown ---
And when I've got him where I think he oughta be
I'm gonna hug him, hug him
I'll hug em and if I have to slug him
He's gonna love, he's gonna love, he's gonna love me
--- Alternate Verse: ---
When you were a kid
And you wanted a doll you got it
Don't ask how you did but when you were a kid
And you wanted a doll you got it
You carefully laid out a plan
When you were a kid 'twas a doll
