------ Only Dance I Know ------
--- Verse: ---
My youth was spent in the Orient
Where they never taught me to waltz
You'd be surprised when I exercised
It was never done to a waltz
It was done like this
But never to a waltz
[1st refrain:]
In ancient Siam, women like I am
Indoors or on the street
No woman dances with her feet
Egyptian, Persian, only one version
No other stands a chance
Feet are for walking, not for dance
To an oriental fiddle,
You can see them shake their middle
The feet don't mean a thing
Middles are all they swing
Even an Egyptian mummy
Wiggles her tummy
Wiggles it so and so
That is the only dance I know
[2nd refrain:]
You don't need an Arthur Murray
Just a fringe that's on the surrey
Will satisfy your needs
Dancing between the beads
Everybody shake your torso
Sexy but more so
Shake it, come on, let's go
