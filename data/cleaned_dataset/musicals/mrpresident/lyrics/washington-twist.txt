------ Washington Twist ------
--- Unknown ---
Doing the Washington twist
Doing the twist with a twist
No one is set till they finally get
On the President's favorite list
President's doubts while the ins and the outs
Keep on doing the Washington Twist
--- Unknown ---
Gentlemen loaded with charm
Seemingly meaning no harm
But while they're there, you're becoming aware
That they're quietly twisting your arm
Gentle in tone while promoting a loan
Which is part of the Washington Twist
--- Unknown ---
Congressmen's lips that are pucked
Waiting for plums to be plucked
Legal concerns, making out their returns
With expenses they'd like to deduct
Drinking a toast to the host with the most
------ fin ------
