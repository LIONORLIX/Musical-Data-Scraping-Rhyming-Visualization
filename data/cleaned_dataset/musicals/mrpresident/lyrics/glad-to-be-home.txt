------ Glad to Be Home ------
--- Unknown ---
I'm so glad to be home again
I promise never to roam again
It's oh so good to be home again
--- Unknown ---
I could cry, I'm so happy
I'm back where I had to be
Awfully glad to be home
--- Unknown ---
My heart suddenly mends again
Among my neighbors and friends again
As I start tying loose ends again
--- Unknown ---
I could cry, I'm so happy
There's no need of askin' me, certainly you can see
