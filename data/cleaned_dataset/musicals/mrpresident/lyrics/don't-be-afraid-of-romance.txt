------ Don't Be Afraid of Romance ------
--- Unknown ---
Don't be afraid of romance
Don't be so frightened, come on take a chance
--- Unknown ---
Don't stop to question is this the real thing
Don't be afraid to let go
Don't run away till you know
--- Unknown ---
Romance is best while you're young
That's when the sweetest of love songs are sung
--- Unknown ---
That's when your daydreams are filled with moonlight
Don't be afraid when you start
