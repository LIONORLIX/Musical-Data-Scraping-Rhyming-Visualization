------ They Love Me ------
--- Verse: ---
Oh! What a trip
What a wonderful trip
And to think that I was worried
At the start of the trip
I must confess that I was filled with doubt
But there was really nothing to worry about

I'm welcome everywhere with open arms

They love me, they love me
I never knew I had so many charms

In India they let me see a mongoose kill a snake

Because they love me, they love me
And they want me to come back again
--- 2nd refrain: ---
They love me, they love me
In Tokyo they think that I'm a dream

They always have a banquet on the day that I arrive
In Borneo they made me eat an octopus alive
--- Unknown ---
Because they love me, they love me
And they want me to come back again

They love me, they love me
With every place I visit it's the same

With every kind of present you can name

I spent a happy day from two to three

They made me ride a camel where I sat between the humps

And they want me to come back
They want me to come back
They want me to come back again
