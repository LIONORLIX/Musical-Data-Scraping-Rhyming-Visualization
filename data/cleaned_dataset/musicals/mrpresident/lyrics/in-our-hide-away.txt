------ In Our Hide-Away ------
--- Unknown ---
In our hide-away, far from all the fuss that bothers us
We'll hide-away, we two
--- Unknown ---
In our hide-away, we'll be all alone, no telephone
To worry me or you
--- Unknown ---
We will have a ball
Busy doin' nothing at all
--- Unknown ---
In our hide-away, we will lock the door and throw away the key
