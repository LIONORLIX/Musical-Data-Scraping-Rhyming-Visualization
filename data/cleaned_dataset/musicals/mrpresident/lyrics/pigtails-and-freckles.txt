------ Pigtails and Freckles ------
--- Unknown ---
Pigtails and freckles, braces on your teeth
Who would have thought you would turn out so beautiful?
--- Unknown ---
Awkward and bashful, scared right from the start
Who would have thought you would turn out so smart?
--- Unknown ---
Changes, many changes, since I first looked at you,
Funny, very funny, what a few years can do
--- Unknown ---
Pigtails and freckles, braces on your teeth
Who would have thought they'd become so sublime?
