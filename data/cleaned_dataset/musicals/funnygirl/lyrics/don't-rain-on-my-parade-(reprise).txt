------ Don't Rain On My Parade (Reprise) ------
--- Unknown ---
I'll march my band out,
I'll beat my drum,
Guess we didn't make it,
At least I didn't fake it.
Don't tell me not to live,
Just sit and putter,
Life's candy; the sun's
A ball of butter.
Don't bring around a cloud
To rain on my parade.
I'm gonna live and live now,
Get what I want I know how,
All that the law will allow.
Hey, gorgeous, here we go again.
Well, here it goes, kid,
No lookin' back,
Stiff upper nose, kid,
Let's give 'em hell, Brice,
We'll cry a little later,
Well, Brice, that's life in the the-a-ter!
Get ready for me, world,
'Cause I'm a comer,
I simply gotta march,
My heart's a drummer.
Nobody, no, nobody
