------ Henry Street ------
--- All ---
Henry Street,
No, it ain't Broadway, it's Henry Street.
Way after midnight
Lit up as bright as a lighthouse
Brighter tonight than the White House.
Boys:
We're proud to tell you that C.P.A.'s
We got in dozens, and lawyers, take your choice.
Messes and messes of young D.D.-esses,
A looney who teaches voice,
Girls:
Ah, ha, ha, ha--
All:
Henry Street has something it ain't had so far:
The greatest, most glamorous, genuine, glorified
Ziegfeld star.
