------ His Love Makes Me Beautiful ------
--- Tenor ---
For better or for worse, Oh Promise Me,
Why does ev'ry bride glow ravishingly?
Within the secret heart of ev'ry bride
These are the words repeating, repeating,
Repeating inside: (Bing, bong, bing, bong)
--- Unknown ---
You are the beautiful reflection
Of his love's affection,
A walking illustration
Of his adoration
--- Unknown ---
His love makes you beautiful,
So beautiful,
So beautiful,
You ask your looking glass,
What is it?
Makes you so exquisite?
The answer to your query
Comes back, dearie--
His love makes you beautiful,
So beautiful,
So beautiful,
And woman loved is woman glorified!
You'll make a beautiful,
Beautiful,
Beautiful,
Beautiful bride!
Chorus:
Here comes the bride,
Another beautiful bride.
Ziegfeld presents her
With justifiable pride.

I am the beautiful reflection
Of my love's affection,
A walking illustration
Of his adoration.
His love makes me beautiful,
So beautiful,
So beautiful,
