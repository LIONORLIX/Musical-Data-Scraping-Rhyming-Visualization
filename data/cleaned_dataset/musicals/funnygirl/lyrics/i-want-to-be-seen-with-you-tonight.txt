------ I Want To Be Seen With You Tonight ------
--- Nick ---
I want to be seen, be seen with you,
With you on my arm,
To wear you like a charm,
Your glitter decorating my arm.
Now, natch'rally such proximity
Gives rumors a rise,
We'll let them analyze
What our amalgamation implies.
Oh yes,
The gossips will press,
So willing to stress
The seamy side--
Know what?
So what!
I want to be seen, be seen with you,
With you on my arm.
Let's give this town a light,
And hit it like a me-te-or-ite--tonight.
I want to be seen with you.
Fanny:
The moon over mother's saloon,
Have a nice macaroon
I'll buy you a light beer.
Nick:
Right, dear.
Both:
I want to be seen, be seen with you,
Nick:
With you on my arm.
Let's give this town a light
And hit it like a me-te-or-ite--
Both:
Tonight--I want to be seen with,
Nick:
Oh, please let me be seen with,
Fanny:
And I would like to be seen with
Both:
