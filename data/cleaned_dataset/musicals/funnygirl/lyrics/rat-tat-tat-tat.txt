------ Rat-tat-tat-tat ------
--- Eddie ---
Our boys went rat-tat-tat-tat,
Rat-tat-tat-tat,
And shot the Kaiser where he sat-tat-tat-at.
With every poppity-pop,
Some Kraut took a drop.
American boys are all such straight shooters--
We'll take care of him, Mother,
When he comes home from the war.
We'll take care of him, Mother,
We'll do everything that you would do--yeah--and more.
Rat-tat-tat-tat,
We'll give their backs a big pat.
They deserve a future full of joys
'Cause they're our Yankee Doodle,
Yankee Doodle,
Yankee Doodle,
Doughboys.
Company--Order--Arms--Roll Call--
Company:
I'm Private Jones from Arkansas,
I'm Private Smith from Kansas,
I'm Private Ryan from Maine,
I'm Private Burke from Wisconsin,
I'm Private O'Brien from Texas,
I'm Private Muntz from Michigan,
Fanny:
.I'm Private Schvartz from Rock-a-way,
And I guess you heard reports
That the Kaiser runs a block away
When they tell him, here comes Schvartz,
'Cause ven I get mad, believe it, Jack,
Out from nowhere comes a maniac,
A kick in the foot,
A shot in the pants--
I wouldn't give a second chance.
Schvartz from Rock-a-way.
Chorus:
Private Schwartz
Private Schwartz
Private Schwartz from Rock-a-way.
Fanny:
I met Mademoiselle from Armentieres
And my bagels gave a spin (oy, yoy),
She said, Private Schvartz,
Come closer, dear!
What a tzimmis I got in!
Ven you're fighting for democracy,
Call on Irving Schvartz and company,
I'm through and through
Red, white and bluish,
I talk this way
Because I'm British.
Tell Far Rock-a-way, don't pull the dock away,
'Cause sailing home is General Schvartz.
All:
Rat-ta ta ta ta tat,
We'll give their backs a big pat.
They deserve a great big medal
And a loud huzzah,
Over here and over there
You'll hear
Rat-tat a tat tat,
Rat-tat a tat tat,
Rat tat a tat tat tat,
That's our Yankee Doodle,
Yankee Doodle
Rat tat a tat tat tat
