(Spoken)
Julia

She looks so perfect.
--- Unknown ---
Holly
I know. Don’t you hate her’
--- Unknown ---
Julia
Hate her’
She’s so happy!
--- Unknown ---
(sung)
She turns around
And she meets his gaze
The lights are dim,
There’s a smoky haze
They share a smile
And a secret wave
It’s a moment built to save
They start to move
Across the floor
The room is frozen,
Wanting more
The happy couple on display
With nothing standing
In their way
It’s so romantic i could die
Right here and now
It’s gonna be that way for us
I know somehow
Someday when it’s me
I’ll know our love
Was meant to be
Not one single complication
Or cause for hesitation
Someday when the dream
Is coming true
All you’ll need is me
And all i’ll need is you
--- Unknown ---
(spoken)
Holly
Julia, take that veil off!
Julia
Okay!
--- Unknown ---
(sung)
They stop and pose
For a photograph
He jokes aorund
Just to make her laugh
The room is full,
But they’re all alone
They have a language
All their own
And i’m so jealous i could cry
And yet i know
It won’t be long
Before you say
We’re good to go
Someday when it’s me
I’ll know our love
Was meant to be
Not one single complication
Or cause for hesitation
Someday when the dream
Is coming true
All you’ll need is me
And all i’ll need is you
I know not every marriage
Lasts when things go bad
I’ve seen the warning signs
I call them ‘mom’ and ‘dad’
But soon you’ll take my hand
And pledge your love to me
Till then i’ll just get married vicariously

Someday when it’s me
I’ll know our love
Was meant to be
Julia
Not one single complication
Or cause for hesitation
Someday when the dream
Is coming true
