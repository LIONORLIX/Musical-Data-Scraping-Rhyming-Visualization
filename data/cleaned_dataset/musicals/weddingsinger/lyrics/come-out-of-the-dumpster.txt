------ Come Out of the Dumpster ------
--- Unknown ---
Julia
So tonight you made some mistakes
I admit it, you hit a few bumps
But i hate to see you like this
Down on your luck, down in the dumps
--- Unknown ---
Though hope may seem in short supply
You have to move on
You have to try
--- Unknown ---
So come out of the dumpster
Don't leave me standing here
Come out of the dumpster
Its ok; the coast is clear
--- Unknown ---
The cop cars are leaving
Channel 5 packed up its crew
So come out of the dumpster
I'll be right here waiting for you
--- Unknown ---
Robbie (spoken)
Ok. I'll try
--- Unknown ---
Julia (spoken)
All right!
--- Unknown ---
(robbie trys to climb out of the dumpster, but falls back in)
--- Unknown ---
Julia (sung)
So you're back in the dumpster
Well, thats like a metaphor
Everyone has a dumpster
A stumbling block you can't ignore
--- Unknown ---
But to fight it makes you stronger
And someday you might stand!
So come out of that dumpster
Here, take a hold of my hand
--- Unknown ---
So your first day back wasn't all you anticipated
--- Unknown ---
Robbie (sung)
I bit the best man
The bride had to be sedated
--- Unknown ---
Julia
But this sort of thing happens all the time
When life gives you garbage
You it to climb!
--- Unknown ---
(robbie climbs out)
--- Unknown ---
Look!
You're out of the dumpster
Now, was that so hard after all?
It was only a dumpster
--- Unknown ---
Robbie
And from here, it looks so small
--- Unknown ---
Julia
Now you're back where you started
On you're way to success
So...
Will you play at my wedding?
--- Unknown ---
Robbie
No!
