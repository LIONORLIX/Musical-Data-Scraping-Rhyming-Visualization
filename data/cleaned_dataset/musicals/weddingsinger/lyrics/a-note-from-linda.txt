------ A Note From Linda ------
--- Linda ---
--- Unknown ---
To my dearest Robbie,
I think we need some space.
Please excuse my timing
dot-dot-dot, smiley face.
--- Unknown ---
You see, I woke this morning,
prepared to walk on air.
But realized that you cramped my style,
as I crimped my hair.
--- Unknown ---
You're just not that same person,
the guy I used to know.
I'm not in love with Robbie Now
but Robbie Seven Years Ago
--- Unknown ---
You could have been in Motely Crue
or David Lee Roth's replacement.
But instead you sing while people chew.
And you live in your grandma's basement!
--- Unknown ---
I hope this note is something
that you can rise above.
Deep down you weren't in love with me,
you were just in love with love.
--- Unknown ---
And so it's best we end this
before we even start.
Signed your pal Linda.
