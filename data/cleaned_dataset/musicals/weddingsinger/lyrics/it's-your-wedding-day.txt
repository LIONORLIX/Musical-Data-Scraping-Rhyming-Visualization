------ It's Your Wedding Day ------

Robbie
I wrote a song six years ago
While playing in a wedding band
The word got out and suddenly
The band and i are in demand
And now couples all over jersey
Hire me to insure their wedded bliss
All because of a tune i wrote
That tune
Goes like this:
Oh, when it's your wedding day
And my music starts to play
I can guarantee that
--- Unknown ---
All
Love will find you!
--- Unknown ---
Robbie
Yeah, when it's your wedding day
All the problems melt away
If you count on me
'Cause love is what i do
Now when we play a wedding gig
--- Unknown ---
Robbie, sammy & george
We're like a finely tuned machine
--- Unknown ---
Robbie
Sammy does van halen licks
While george gets down on tambourine
We might play you some careless whisper
--- Unknown ---
Sammy & george
Or make you wish you had

Jessie's girl instead

Bring the room down with endless love

Long before the night is through
Your uncle will be my uncle, too
I'll be so tight with your cousin steve
He'll invite me over for christmas eve
I'll dance your mom all around the room
Then present the bride and groom
