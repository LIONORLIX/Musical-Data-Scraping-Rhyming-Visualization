------ Let Me Come Home ------
--- Linda ---
I know i kind ok went out with a bang
When i dumped you out of the blue
But my heart's just like a boomerang
It came right back to you
--- Unknown ---
Now i'm confessin'
I've learned my lesson
Give me your blessin'
To come back home
Here's what i'm trying to say
--- Unknown ---
Let me come home to you baby
Let me come home
Let me come home to you baby
Let me come home
--- Robbie ---
I don't wanna be alone anymore...
--- Linda ---
You don't have to be, baby...
--- Unknown ---
Now i could try and date some glamorous guy
And things might turn out cool
But as i learned when i applied to devry
You gotta have a safety school
--- Unknown ---
Now you're my back-up
Don't make me pack-up
And have to shack up
Cdown by the interstate
Yeah, i'll reiterate
--- Unknown ---
Let me come home to you baby
Let me come home
Let me come home to you baby
Let me come home
--- Unknown ---
And tomorrow when you wake up
You'll no longer have an ex
Cause the best part of a break-up
Is the make-up sex
--- Unknown ---
Let me come home to you baby
Let me come home
Let me come home to you baby
Let me come home
--- Unknown ---
Let me come home to you baby
Let me come home
Let me come
Let me come
Let me come home
