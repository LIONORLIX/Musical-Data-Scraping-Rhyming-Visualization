------ If I Told You (Reprise) ------
--- Rosie ---
i'm now going to read a poem that i wrote for my husband,
on this our very special day.
--- Robbie ---
And i wonder if i might have let you slip away, and are you gone for good.
And i wonder is there something left that i could say...
and
--- robbie & Julia ---
If i told you
--- Unknown ---
[J] All the words i've yet to say
[R] I wonder if i told you...
[J] would they matter, or would you simply turn and walk away...
--- Rosie ---
And now that its been fifty years i still have you to dry my tears
And sheild me from all fears and harms
Heres to fifty more years in your arms
--- Robbie ---
I wonder if its true...I wonder if i hold you... i wonder
[Julia]
If i hold you, will you tell me i should go
do i chance it or would it just be better not to know
--- Robbie ---
