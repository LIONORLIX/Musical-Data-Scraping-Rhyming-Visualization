------ If I Told You ------
--- Unknown ---
Robbie
Standing here underneath your window
Searching for some kind of sign
Every move, every tiny gesture
Only proves you're not mine
I could write you a thousand love songs
Search the world for the perfect tune and rhyme
But what good would when it seems i'm out of time
--- Unknown ---
If i told you
All the words i've yet to say
Would they matter
Or would you simply turn and walk away
If i hold you
Would you tell me i should go
Do i chance it
Or would it just be better not to know
--- Unknown ---
Julia
Who's that girl with the perfect future
Her reflection says it all
Trying hard to pretend she's eager
Searching for some way to stall
So unsure of the road she's chosen
Faced with feelings her heart should not allow
On thing's certain, it seems
That she just can't turn back now
If she can, tell her how
--- Unknown ---
Both
If i told you
All the words i've yet to say
Would they matter
Or would you simply turn and walk away
If i hold you   (if i hold you)
Would you tell me i should go
Do i chance it
Or would it just be better not to know
--- Unknown ---
Would it just be better...
Not to know
