------ One Fine Day ------
--- Unknown ---
One fine day
You'll look at me
And you will know our love was meant to be
One fine day
You're gonna want me for your girl
--- Unknown ---
The arms I long for
Will open wide
And you'll be proud to have me walking right by your side
One fine day
You're gonna want me for your girl
--- Unknown ---
Though I know you're the kind of a boy
Who only wants to run around
I'll keep waiting
And some day, darling
You'll come to me when you want to settle down
--- Unknown ---
Oh, one fine day
We'll meet once more
And then you'll want the love you threw away before
One fine day
You're gonna want me for your girl x3

Though I know you're the kind of boy who only wants to run around
I'll keep waiting
And someday darling
You'll come to me when you want to settle down
Oh
One fine day
We'll meet once more
And then you'll want the love you threw away before
One fine day
You're gonna want me for your girl x3
