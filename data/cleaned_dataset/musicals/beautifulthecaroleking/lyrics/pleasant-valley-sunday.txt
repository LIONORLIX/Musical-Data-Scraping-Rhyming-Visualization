------ Pleasant Valley Sunday ------
--- Unknown ---
The local rock group down the street
Is trying hard to learn their song
They serenade the weekend squire
Who just came out to mow his lawn
--- Unknown ---
Another Pleasant Valley Sunday
Charcoal burning everywhere
Rows of houses that are all the same
And no one seems to care
--- Unknown ---
See Mrs. Gray, she's proud today
Because her roses are in bloom
And Mr. Green, he's so serene
He's got a TV in every room
--- Unknown ---
Another Pleasant Valley Sunday
Here in status symbol land
Mothers complain about how hard life is
And the kids just don't understand
--- Unknown ---
Creature comfort goals
They only numb my soul
And make it hard for me to see
--- Unknown ---
My thoughts all seem to stray
To places far away
I need a change of scenery
--- Unknown ---
Another Pleasant Valley Sunday
Charcoal burning everywhere
Another Pleasant Valley Sunday
Here in status symbol land
--- Unknown ---
Another Pleasant Valley Sunday
Another Pleasant Valley Sunday
Another Pleasant Valley Sunday
