Chains, my baby's got me locked up in chains
And they ain't the kind that you can see
Whoa, it's chains of love got a hold on me, yeah

Chains, well, I can't break away from these chains
Can't run around
'Cause I'm not free
Whoa, these chains of love won't let me be, yeah

Now believe me when I tell you
I think you're fine
I'd like to hold you
But I can't break away from all of these chains

Your lips look sweet
I'd like to kiss them
But I can't break away from all these chains
