------ Up on the Roof ------
--- Unknown ---
When this old world starts getting me down
And people are just too much for me to face
I climb way up to the top of the stairs
And all my cares just drift right in to space
--- Unknown ---
On the roof it's peaceful as can be
And there the world below can't bother me
--- Unknown ---
Let me tell you now
When I come home feelin' tired and beat
I go up where the air is fresh and sweet
I get away from the hustling crowds
And all that rat race noise down in the street
--- Unknown ---
On the roof's the only place I know
Where you just have to wish to make it so
Oh, let's go
up on the roof
--- Unknown ---
At night the stars put on a show for free
And darling, you can share it all with me
--- Unknown ---
I keep a-telling you
Right smack down in the middle of town
I found a paradise that's trouble proof
So if this world starts getting you down
there's room enough for two up on the roof
--- Unknown ---
Up on the roof
Everyhting's all right
Up on the roof
Oh, come on baby
Up on the roof
