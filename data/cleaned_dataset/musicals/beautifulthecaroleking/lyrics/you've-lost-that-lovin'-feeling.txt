------ You've Lost That Lovin' Feeling ------
--- Unknown ---
You never close your eyes anymore when I kiss your lips.
And there's no tenderness like before in your fingertips.
You're trying hard not to show it, (baby).
But baby, baby I know it...
--- Unknown ---
You've lost that lovin' feeling,
Whoa, that lovin' feeling,
You've lost that lovin' feeling,
Now it's gone...gone...gone...wooooooh.
--- Unknown ---
Now there's no welcome look in your eyes
when I reach for you.
And now your're starting to critisize little things I do.
It makes me just feel like crying, (baby).
'Cause baby, something in you is dying.
--- Unknown ---
You lost that lovin' feeling,
Whoa, that lovin' feeling,
You've lost that lovin' feeling,
Now it's gone...gone...gone...woooooah
--- Unknown ---
Baby, baby, I get down on my knees for you.
--- Unknown ---
If you would only love me like you used to do, yeah.
--- Unknown ---
We had a love...a love...a love you don't find everyday.
--- Unknown ---
So don't...don't...don't...don't let it slip away.
--- Unknown ---
Baby (baby), baby (baby),
I beg of you please...please,
I need your love (I need your love),
I need your love (I need your love),
So bring it on back (So bring it on back),
Bring it on back (so bring it on back).
--- Unknown ---
Bring back that lovin' feeling,
Whoa, that lovin' feeling
Bring back that lovin' feeling,
'Cause it's gone...gone...gone,
and I can't go on,
noooo...
--- Unknown ---
Bring back that lovin' feeling,
Whoa, that lovin' feeling
Bring back that lovin' feeling,
