------ Some Kind of Wonderful ------
--- Unknown ---
All you have to do is touch my hand
To show me you understand
And something happens to me
That's some kind of wonderful
--- Unknown ---
Anytime my little world is blue
I just have to look at you
And everything seems to be
Some kind of wonderful
--- Unknown ---
I know I can't express
This feeling of tenderness
There's so much I want to say
But the right words just don't come my way
--- Unknown ---
I just know when I'm in your embrace
This world is a happy place
And something happens to me
That's some kind of wonderful
--- Unknown ---
Some kind of wonderful
Some kind of wonderful
Wonderful, wonderful
Some kind of wonderful
--- Unknown ---
Some kind of wonderful
Some kind of wonderful
Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful
Some kind of wonderful
