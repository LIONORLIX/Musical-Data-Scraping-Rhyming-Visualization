------ Uptown ------
--- Unknown ---
He gets up each morning and he goes downtown
Where everyone's his boss and he's lost in an angry land
He's a little man
--- Unknown ---
But then he comes uptown each ev'nin' to my tenement
Uptown where folks don't have to pay much rent
And when he's there with me he can see that he's everything
Then he's tall, he don't crawl, he's a king
--- Unknown ---
Downtown he's just one of a million guys
He don't get no breaks and he takes all they got to give
'cause he's got to live
--- Unknown ---
But then he comes uptown where he can hold his head up high
Uptown he knows that I am standing by
And when I take his hand there's no man who could put him down
The world is sweet, it's at his feet when he's uptown
--- Unknown ---
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, oh-yeah
--- Unknown ---
Let me tell ya now
