--- MYRA ---
Dolores!  Dolores, come to the window.
DOLORES
What's wrong?
MYRA
Hold on, I gotta catch my breath.  I ran all the way from the fish monger.
PASHA
I heard you all the way from the bedroom.  What did I miss?
DOLORES
What happened at the fishmonger?
PASHA
How should I know what happened at the fishmonger?  I was in the bedroom.
MYRA
Will you two just listen?  You'll never guess who's getting married and why.
DOLORES
Grace Kelly... Because she's tired of Hollywood.
PASHA
You're a panic, you are.
DOLORES
Tell us already.
MYRA
Aggie's girl, Janey.
DOLORES & PASHA
To the one with the glasses?
MYRA
That's what I heard.
PASHA
Do you think the father caught them upstairs?
MYRA
Maybe, but it might be something more than that.
I've been thinking Janey looks a little fat.
PASHA
Maybe she just likes to eat.
MYRA
Or maybe we'll soon hear the patter of little feet!
DOLORES
You suppose?
PASHA
NO, no, no, that's how rumors get started.
MYRA
It's not a rumor.  I heard it at the fishmonger.
