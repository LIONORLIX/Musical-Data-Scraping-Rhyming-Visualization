--- SAM ---
Hey Tom, you got a minute?
TOM
Go on, Aggie.  I'll be right in.
Thanks for bringing the cab  out to get us.
SAM
Sure.  I drove your shift last night.  I wasn't planning on working a double.  So how you doing?
TOM
It's been three months, but it's till hard to get my head wrapped around.
SAM
Oh, sure.  Tough stuff.  But here's something that might cheer you up.
I didn't want to say anything in front of the missus.  Your business is your business.
Pasternak is selling his share of the cab.  She's all ours.
TOM
The cab's all ours?
SAM
That's what I'm saying.  So, what's the matter?
TOM
It's just that the three of us been owning that hack together...
SAM
... twenty-six years.
TOM
Pasternak's retiring?
SAM
He's tired.
TOM
Who ain't?
SAM
So, what's the long puss?
JANEY
You don't want to marry me?
RALPH
Of course I do.  You know I do.  This is just a little out of nowhere.
JANEY
Actually, I've been thinking about it for a couple of days.
RALPH
Days?  Glad to know you're not rushing into anything.
JANEY
Would you listen?
You know that my friend Kelly is getting married and moving to California to live with her folks, right?
RALPH
Since she's four months pregnant, it's none too soon.
JANEY
Exactly why they're flying.  Problem is, there's only so much they can take on the plane.
And then they got their car to consider.
RALPH
So?
JANEY
So, they need to hire someone they can trust to drive their car and stuff to California.
RALPH
You mean you want us to... to drive the car?
JANEY
Who's more trustworthy than us?  It's perfect.
First stop, City Hall for a ten-dollar wedding, and then we're off on a California honeymoon.
All expenses
paid!  Kid, you are marrying a genius.
TOM
Seems awful sudden is all.
SAM
Any less sudden and we'd be retiring along with him.
TOM
Finally our own cab.  Fifty-fifty.
SAM
Partners!
TOM
Just like that!
SAM
Sittin' in the bleachers,
Now we're up to bat.
TOM
Can't help feelin' like  a horse I picked came through.
RALPH
We're getting married.  Imagine us... Partners!
JANEY
A team for life!
RALPH
Can't believe you're ready to become my wife.
JANEY & TOM
Guess you wait long enough, a dream just may come true.
ALL
And I finally get to be partners with you.
JANEY
But no big wedding, no big fuss,
Nobody there but the clerk and us.
No one to satisfy,
No one to please,
And no catastrophes.
Every wedding I attend
There's a fight scene before the end.
Somebody's drunk,
And somebody's nose gets out of joint.
What's the point?
The point is...
JANEY & SAM
Partners!
Quick and neat!
Sign a piece of paper,
And the deal's complete.
RALPH
How romantic.
JANEY
It's a merger, cut and dry.
I don't mean to sound heartless...
SAM
He don't mean to sound heartless,
But Pasternak said they send you dough
When your kid gets killed in action.
So, he figures if he sells his share now, he can buy 'er,
And he can retire.
We'll get a third more money
For a third more work.
A third more sanity
Without that jerk.
A third more profit if we ever cash 'er in.
It's win, win, win...
TOM
So you're sayin' I should use the money the government sends us for losing our kid.
I haven't even got it yet.
SAM
Hey, if you can't trust your Uncle Sam...?  Meantime, all Pasternak wants is a deposit.
TOM
Still, that's an awful lot of money.  Plus all our savings...
SAM
Which you've been saving for what?
TOM
Can you come back tomorrow for the check?  Give me some time to break it to Aggie.
She's not the kind of woman you can spring stuff on.
SAM
You think this is gonna take some explaining?
RALPH
A lot of explaining.  You know my folks.
They are going to want to make a big affair like they did for both of my sisters.
JANEY
And there's the beauty part: No time.  We're not on our schedule.
We're not on their schedule.  We're on Kelly's schedule.
SAM
And suddenly I see a big improvement in our occupation.
JANEY
Suddenly a shiny little ring for me to grab.
ALL
All we have to do is take advantage of the situation.
SAM
A windfall blows...
JANEY
Kelly's belly grows...
RALPH
A quickie wedding and a free vacation...
ALL
We'll be...
Partners!
Almost there!
RALPH
Feel like any moment I could walk on air.
JANEY & RALPH
Guess if you're lucky
One and one makes more than two.
SAM & TOM
You and me,
Partners!
Ain't it grand!
We bet all the chips
On a winning hand.
ALL
It's even sweeter
'Cause it's so long overdue.
But now I finally get to be partners...
SAM & TOM
With you.
JANEY & RALPH
With you.
SAM & TOM
With you.
JANEY & RALPH
