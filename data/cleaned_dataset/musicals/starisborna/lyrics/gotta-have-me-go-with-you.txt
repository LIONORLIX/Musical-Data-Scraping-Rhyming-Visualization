------ Gotta Have Me Go With You ------
--- Unknown ---
What a spot, this
Not so hot, this!
Hey, there shy one,
Come be my one!
Please don't rush off
Want no brush-off.
I can't compel you
To buy what I'd sell you
But I've got to tell you
Like so:
--- Unknown ---
You wanna have bells that'll ring
You wanna have songs that'll sing
You want your sky a baby blue
You gotta have me go with you
--- Unknown ---
Hey, you fool you!
Why so cool, you!
When I'm ready
To go steady?
--- Unknown ---
You wanna have eyes that'll shine?
You wanna have grapes on a vine?
You want a love that's truly true?
You gotta have me go with you!
--- Unknown ---
Why the holdout?
Have you sold out?
Time you woke up
Time you spoke up
--- Unknown ---
This line I'm handing you
Is not a handout
As a team, we'd be a standout.
--- Unknown ---
You wanna live high on a dime?
You wanna have two hearts in rhyme?
Gotta have me go with you
