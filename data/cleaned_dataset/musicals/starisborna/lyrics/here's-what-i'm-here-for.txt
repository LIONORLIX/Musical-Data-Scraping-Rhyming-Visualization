------ Here's What I'm Here For ------
--- Unknown ---
What am I here for?
It's time you knew.
Here's what I'm here for:
I'm here for you.
Can you forgive me?
Am I too late?
All the years that I've wandered and pondered
Were squandered.
--- Unknown ---
My heart insisted
I seek you out.
That you existed,
My heart had no doubt.
To share a journey that leads to heaven's door,
You'll find is what I'm here for.
