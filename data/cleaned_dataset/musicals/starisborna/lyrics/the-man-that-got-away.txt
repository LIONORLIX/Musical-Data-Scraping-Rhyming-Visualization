------ The Man That Got Away ------
--- Unknown ---
The night is bitter,
The stars have lost their glitter;
The winds grow colder
And suddenly you're older -
And all because of the man that got away.
--- Unknown ---
No more his eager call,
The writing's on the wall;
The dreams you dreamed have all
Gone astray.
--- Unknown ---
The man that won you
Has gone off and undone you.
That great beginning
Has seen the final inning.
Don't know what happened. It's all a crazy game!
--- Unknown ---
No more that all-time thrill,
For you've been through the mill -
And never a new love will
Be the same.
--- Unknown ---
Good riddance, good-bye!
Ev'ry trick of his you're on to.
But, fools will be fools -
And where's he gone to?
--- Unknown ---
The road gets rougher,
It's lonelier and tougher.
With hope you burn up -
Tomorrow he may turn up.
There's just no letup the live-long night and day!
--- Unknown ---
Ever since this world began
There is nothing sadder than
A one-man woman looking for
The man that got away...
