Dear Evan Hansen,
Today is going to be a good day and here's why
because today, no matter what else, today at least, you're you.
No secrets or lying.
Just you
Maybe someday everything that happened,
Maybe it will all feel like a distant memory.
Maybe ten years from now, no-one will even remember about the Connor Project or me.
They'll just come here and pick apples and enjoy their picnics and that'll be it.
--- Unknown ---
EVAN: (sung)
All we see is sky for forever
Let the world pass by for forever
Feels like we could go on for forever this way
This way
--- Unknown ---
EVAN: (spoken)
Maybe some day some other kid is going to be standing out here, staring at the trees.
Feeling so alone,wondering if the world might look different from all the way up there.
Then maybe he'll start climbing one branch at a time
and he'll keep going, even when it seems like he can't find another foothold.
Even when it feels hopeless, like everything is telling him to just let go.
This time, maybe this time he won't let go.
He'll just hold on.
He'll hold on and he'll keep going.
He'll keep going until he sees the sun.
--- WHOLE CAST ---
All we see is light for forever
'cause the sun shines bright for forever
Life will be alright for forever this way
This way
--- Unknown ---
All we see is light
Watch the sun burn bright
We will be alright for forever this way
All we see is sky for forever
