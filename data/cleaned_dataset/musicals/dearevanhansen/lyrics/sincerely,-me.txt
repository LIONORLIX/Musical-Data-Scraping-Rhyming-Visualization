Dear Evan Hansen,
We've been way too out of touch
Things have been crazy and it sucks that we don't talk that much
I should tell you that I think of you each night
I rub my nipples and start moaning with delight
--- Unknown ---
EVAN: (spoken) Why would you write that?
--- Unknown ---
JARED: (spoken) I'm just trying to tell the truth
--- EVAN ---
(spoken) You know what? If you aren't going to take this seriously...
--- Unknown ---
JARED: (spoken) Okay you need to calm yourself!
--- Unknown ---
EVAN: (spoken) This has to be perfect, okay?
The emails have to prove that we were actually friends.
They've got to be completely realistic
--- Unknown ---
JARED: (spoken) There is nothing unrealistic about the love that one man feels for another.
--- Unknown ---
EVAN: (spoken) Let's go back.
--- Unknown ---
JARED: (spoken) In fact, it's something quite beautiful.
--- Unknown ---
EVAN: (spoken) Let's go back Jared!
--- Unknown ---
CONNOR: I've gotta tell you life without you has been hard
--- Unknown ---
JARED: (spoken) Hard?
--- Unknown ---
CONNOR: Has been bad
--- Unknown ---
JARED: (spoken) Bad?
--- Unknown ---
CONNOR: Has been rough
--- Unknown ---
JARED: (spoken) Lame!
--- Unknown ---
CONNOR: And I miss talking about life and other stuff
--- Unknown ---
JARED: (spoken) Very specific
--- Unknown ---
EVAN: (spoken) Shut up
--- Unknown ---
CONNOR: I like my parents
--- Unknown ---
JARED: (spoken) Who says that?
--- CONNOR ---
I love my parents
But each day's another fight
If I stop smoking drugs then everything might be alright
--- Unknown ---
JARED: (spoken) Smoking drugs
--- Unknown ---
EVAN: (spoken) Just fix it!
--- Unknown ---
JARED: (spoken) This isn't realistic at all! It doesn't even sound like Connor!
--- Unknown ---
EVAN: (spoken) Well I want to show that I was a good friend,
Y'know? That I was trying to help him
--- Unknown ---
JARED: (spoken) You are just cute as a freaking button
--- Unknown ---
CONNOR: If I stop smoking crack
--- Unknown ---
EVAN: (spoken) Crack?!
--- CONNOR ---
If I stop smoking pot then everything might be alright
I'll take your advice
I'll try to be more nice
I'll turn it around
Wait and see
--- Unknown ---
It’s all that it takes
Is a little reinvention
It’s easy to change if you give it your attention
All you gotta do is just believe you can be who you want
to be sincerely, me
--- Unknown ---
JARED: (spoken) Are we done yet?
--- Unknown ---
EVAN: (spoken) Well I mean I can't just show them one email
--- Unknown ---
JARED: (spoken) Okay, please stop hyperventilating
--- Unknown ---
EVAN: (spoken) I'm not hyperventilating
--- Unknown ---
JARED: (spoken) You're having considerable trouble breathing
--- Unknown ---
EVAN: (spoken) I'm having no trouble breathing
--- Unknown ---
JARED: (spoken) Do you need a paper bag to breath into?
--- Unknown ---
EVAN: (spoken) I'm not hyperventilating!
--- Unknown ---
EVAN: (sung)
Dear Connor Murphy,
Yes I've also missed our talks
Stop doing drugs
Just try to take deep breaths and go on walks
--- Unknown ---
I'm sending pictures of the most amazing trees
--- Unknown ---
JARED: (spoken) No!
--- Unknown ---
EVAN: You'll be obsessed with all my forest expertise
--- Unknown ---
JARED: (spoken) Ridiculous!
--- EVAN ---
Dude I'm proud of you
Just keep pushing through
You're turning around
I can see
--- Unknown ---
CONNOR: Just wait and see
--- ALL ---
It’s all that it takes
Is a little reinvention
It’s easy to change if you give it your attention
All you gotta do is just believe you can be who you want to be sincerely, me
--- Unknown ---
CONNOR: My sister's hot
--- Unknown ---
EVAN: (spoken) What the hell?
--- Unknown ---
JARED: (spoken) My bad
--- Unknown ---
CONNOR: Dear Evan Hansen, thanks for every note you send
--- Unknown ---
EVAN: Dear Connor Murphy, I'm just glad to be your friend
--- Unknown ---
EVAN & CONNOR: Our friendship goes beyond your average kind of bond
--- Unknown ---
But not because we're Gay
No not because we're gay
We're close, but not that way
The only man that I love is my dad
--- Unknown ---
CONNOR: Well anyway
--- Unknown ---
EVAN: You're getting better everyday
--- Unknown ---
CONNOR: I'm getting better everyday
--- Unknown ---
EVAN & CONNOR: We're getting better everyday
--- Unknown ---
ALL: Hey hey hey hey!
--- Unknown ---
It’s all that it takes
Is a little reinvention
It’s easy to change if you give it your attention
All you gotta do is just believe you can be who you want to be sincerely,
--- Unknown ---
Miss you dearly

Sincerely Me
