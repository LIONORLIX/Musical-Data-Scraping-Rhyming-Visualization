------ So Big/So Small ------
--- HEIDI ---
It was a February day
When your dad before going away
A U-Haul truck in the driveway
The day was suddenly real
--- Unknown ---
I told you not to come outside
But you saw that truck
And you smiled so wide
A real live truck in your driveway
We let you sit behind the wheel
Good-bye, good-bye
Now it's just me and my little guy
And the house felt so big, and I felt so small
The house felt so big, and I felt so small
--- Unknown ---
That night I tucked you into bed
I will never forget how you sat up and said
Is there another truck coming to our driveway
A truck that will take mommy away?
And the house felt so big, and I felt so small
The house felt so big, and I knew
There would be moments like this
And I knew
There would be space I couldn't fill
And I knew
I'd come up short a million different ways
And I did
And I do
And I will
--- Unknown ---
But like that February day
I will take your hand, squeeze it tightly and say
There's not another truck in the driveway
--- Unknown ---
Your mom isn't going anywhere
Your mom is staying right here
Your mom isn't going anywhere
Your mom is staying right here
No matter what
I'll be here

When it feels so big
'til it all feels so small
When it feels so big
'til it all feels so small
