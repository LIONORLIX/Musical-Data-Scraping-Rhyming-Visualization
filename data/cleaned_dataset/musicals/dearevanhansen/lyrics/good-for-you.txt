------ Good For You ------
--- HEIDI ---
So you found a place where the grass is greener
And you jumped the fence to the other side
Is it good?
Are they giving you a world I could never provide?
--- Unknown ---
Well I hope you're proud of your big decision
Yeah, I hope it's all that you want and more
Now you're free from the agonizing life you were living before
--- Unknown ---
Say what you need to say
So that you get to walk away
It would kill you to have to stay trapped
When you've got something new
Well I'm sorry you had it rough
I'm sorry I'm not enough
Thank God they rescued you
--- Unknown ---
So you got what you always wanted
So you got your dream come true
Good for you
Good for you, you , you
Got a taste of a life so perfect
So you did what you had to do
Good for you
Good for you

ALANA: (spoken) Why did Connor kill himself?
--- Unknown ---
EVAN: (spoken) Wait what?
--- Unknown ---
ALANA: (spoken)
He was doing better
That's what he told you in every single email
and then a month later he kills himself?
How does that make sense?
--- Unknown ---
EVAN: (spoken)
Why are you so obsessed with this?
You didn't even know him
--- Unknown ---
ALANA: (spoken) Because it's important!
--- Unknown ---
EVAN: (spoken)
Because he was your lab partner?
Or because, I don't know
Maybe because you want to add another extracurricular for your college application
--- Unknown ---
ALANA: (spoken)
Because I know what it's like to feel invisible, just like Connor!
To feel invisible and alone and like nobody would even notice if you vanished into thin air
I bet you used to know what that felt like, too!
--- Unknown ---
EVAN: (spoken)
We need more emails
Emails showing that he was getting worse
This isn't funny!
--- Unknown ---
JARED: (spoken) Oh I think it's hilarious!
I think everyone would probably think it's hilarious
--- Unknown ---
EVAN: (spoken) What is that supposed to mean?
--- Unknown ---
JARED: (spoken) It means you should remember who your friends are
--- Unknown ---
EVAN: (spoken) I thought the only reason you even talk to me is because of your car insurance?
--- Unknown ---
JARED: (spoken) So?
--- Unknown ---
EVAN: (spoken) So? Maybe the only reason you talk to me, Jared, is because you don't have any other friends!
--- Unknown ---
JARED: (spoken) I could tell everyone everything!
--- Unknown ---
EVAN: (spoken) Great! Go ahead, do it! Tell everyone how you helped write emails pretending to be a kid who killed himself.
--- Unknown ---
JARED: (spoken) Fuck you, Evan! Asshole
--- ALANA ---
Did it cross your mind to be slightly sorry?
Do you even care that you might be wrong?
Was it fun?
Well I hope you had a blast while you dragged me along
--- JARED ---
And you say what you need to say
And you play who you need to play
And if somebody's in your way
Crush them and leave them behind
Well I guess since I'm not of use
Go ahead you can cut me loose
Go ahead now
--- Unknown ---
JARED & ALANA: I won't mind
--- HEIDI ---
I'll shut my mouth and I'll let you go
Is that good for you?
Would that be good for you you you?
--- HEIDI & ALANA ---
I'll just sit back while you run the show
Is that good for you?
Would that be good for you you you?
--- HEIDI, ALANA & JARED ---
I'll shut my mouth and I'll let you go
Is that good for you?
Would that be good for you you you?
I'll just sit back while you run the show
Is that good for you?
Good for you
--- EVAN ---
[?] time to think
but the book is about to sink
Can't erase what I wrote and [?]
Tell me how could you change the story?
--- EVAN ---
Stop it stop it!Just let me go!
--- ALANA, JARED & HEIDI ---
So you got what you always wanted
So you got your dream come true
Good for you
Good for you, you , you
Got a taste of a life so perfect
Now you've changed into someone new
Good for you
Good for you
Good for you
Good for you
