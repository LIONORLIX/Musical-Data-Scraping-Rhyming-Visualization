------ Anybody Have a Map? ------
--- HEIDI ---
Another stellar conversation for the scrapbook
Another stumble as I'm reaching for the right thing to say
It's a mystery at best
And with every second - second guessed
The answers feel lightyears away
--- Unknown ---
See it used to be you'd come to me and solve all the problems
I could scare off any monster
Find Waldo every time
It was Super Mom to the rescue
You thought I knew it all
--- Unknown ---
But I somehow went from bounding over buildings
To searching in the dark
As you became this total question mark
So...
--- Unknown ---
So, does anybody have a map?
Anybody maybe happen to know how the hell to do this?
I don't know if you can tell
But this is me just pretending to know
--- Unknown ---
So where's the map?
I need a clue
'Cause the scary truth is
I'm flying blind
I'm making this up as I go
--- CYNTHIA ---
Another masterful attempt ends with disaster
Pour another cup of coffee
Watch it all crash and burn
It's a puzzle
It's a maze
I've tried to steer through it a million ways
But, each day is another wrong turn
--- Unknown ---
Is there a class that I can take to learn your language?
'Cause I am trying to get with it
I use Google as a verb
Somebody come to the rescue before I'm too far gone
--- BOTH ---
Does anybody have a map?

But this is me just pretending to know
--- Unknown ---
So where's the map?
I need a clue
'Cause the scary truth is
--- CYNTHIA ---
I'm flying blind (I'm flying blind)
I'm flying blind (I'm flying blind)
--- BOTH ---
I'm flying blind
And I'm making this up as I go
