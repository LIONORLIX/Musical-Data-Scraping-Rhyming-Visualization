------ For Forever ------
--- EVAN ---
End of May or Early June
This picture perfect afternoon we shared
Drive the winding country road
Grab a scoop at A La Mode
And then we're there
--- Unknown ---
An open field that's framed with trees
We pick a spot and shoot the breeze
Like buddies do
--- Unknown ---
Quoting songs by our favorite bands
Telling jokes no one understands
Except us two
And we talk and take in the view
--- Unknown ---
All we see is sky for forever
Let the world pass by for forever
Feels like we could go on for forever this way
Two friends on a perfect day
--- Unknown ---
We walk a while and we talk about
The things we'll do when we get out of school
Bike the Appalachian trail or
Write a book
Or learn to sail
Wouldn't that be cool
--- Unknown ---
There's nothing that we can't discuss
Like girls we wish would notice us but never do
He looks around and says to me
There's nowhere else I'd rather be
I say me too
--- Unknown ---
And we talk and take in the view
We just talk and take in the view
--- Unknown ---
All we see is sky for forever
Let the world pass by for forever
Feels like we could go on for forever this way
This way
--- Unknown ---
All we see is light for forever
'Cause the sun shines bright for forever
Life will be all right for forever this way
Two friends on a perfect day
--- Unknown ---
And there he goes
Racing toward the tallest tree
From far across the yellow field I hear him calling follow me
And there we go
Wondering how the world might look from up so high
--- Unknown ---
One foot after the other
One branch then to another
I climb higher and higher
I climb until the entire
Sun shines on my face
--- Unknown ---
And I suddenly feel the branch give way
I'm on the ground
My arm goes numb
I look around
And I see him coming to get me
He's coming to get me
And everything's okay
--- Unknown ---
All we see is sky for forever
Let the world pass by for forever
Buddy, you and I for forever this way
This way
--- Unknown ---
All we see is light
'cuz the sun shines bright
Life will be all right for forever this way
Two friends
True friends
