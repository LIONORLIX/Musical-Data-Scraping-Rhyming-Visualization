------ Disappear ------
--- CONNOR ---
Guys like you and me
We're just the losers
And we keep waiting to be seen, right?
And no one seems to care
Or stops to notice that we're there
So we get lost in the in between
--- Unknown ---
But if you can somehow keep them thinking of him
And make me more than an abandoned memory
That means we matter too
It means someone will see that you are there
--- Unknown ---
No one deserves to be forgotten
No one deserves to fade away
No one should come and go
And have no one know he was ever even here
No one deserves to disappear
To disappear
Disappear
--- Unknown ---
It's true
But even if you've always been that
Barely in the background kind of guy
--- Unknown ---
EVAN: You still matter
--- Unknown ---
CONNOR: And even if you're somebody who can't escape the feeling
that the world's past you by
--- Unknown ---
EVAN: You still matter
--- CONNOR ---
If you never get around to doing some remarkable thing
That doesn't mean that you're not worth remembering
But the people who need to know
--- Unknown ---
EVAN: They need to know
--- Unknown ---
CONNOR: You need to know
--- Unknown ---
EVAN: I'll show them
--- Unknown ---
CONNOR: That no one deserves to be forgotten
--- EVAN ---
No one deserves to be forgotten
No one deserves to fade away, to fade away
--- EVAN & CONNOR ---
No one should flicker out
Or have any doubt that it matters that they are here
--- Unknown ---
EVAN: No one deserves
--- Unknown ---
CONNOR: No one deserves
--- Unknown ---
EVAN & CONNOR: To disappear, to disappear, to disappear
--- CONNOR ---
When you're falling in a forest and there's nobody around
All you want is somebody to find you
When you're falling in a forest
And when you hit the ground
All you need is somebody to find you
--- Unknown ---
EVAN: No one deserves to be forgotten
--- Unknown ---
EVAN, ALANA & JARED: No one deserves to fade away
--- Unknown ---
CYNTHIA: No one deserves to be forgotten
--- EVAN, ALANA, JARED & CYNTHIA ---
No one deserves to be forgotten
No one should flicker out or have any doubt
That it matters that they are here
--- Unknown ---
No one deserves to disappear
To disappear
To Disappear
No one deserves, no one deserves, no one deserves to be forgotten
No one deserves to disappear
