------ The Streets of Dublin ------
--- Robbie ---
I don't want to stand
on the stage with a sword.
I went to a pantomim once.
I was bored.
I'm not a poetical sort of a person like you.
When I need a poem,
the sreets and the gutters will do.
--- Unknown ---
There's Tommy Flanagan who lights the gas lamps-
A hundred ninty lamps in Phoenix park alone.
He's done it drunk for over fifty-seven years
In Dublin!
--- Unknown ---
And down on Henry street is Mad John Maher-
Old ramblin' Johnny with a face like hammered meat!
But Johnny's singin' brings a Dublin man to tears.
--- Unknown ---
I don't know
The words to tell you how it feels
or how to put it in a rhyme,
but if you come with me you'll know
How the lamps in the park
look like god in the dark
as they glow
on the streets of Dublin
--- Unknown ---
The dealers hawkin' and the dockers yellin'
the buskers bangin' and the ragmen ringin' bells,
and there's Maureen whose door is always open for
All Dublin!
--- Unknown ---
And Tony Kiely with his racing pigeons.
It's like religon how he lives to fly those birds-
He swears they travel for a hundred miles or more.
--- Unknown ---
I don't know
The kind of words that you might say
but I can put it my own way,
and if you come with me you'll know
that thoses birds on the wing
are a beautiful thing
as they blow
through the streets of Dublin
--- Unknown ---
And there's music like nothin' you've heard
if you know the right jukebox to play!
There are glasses to raise in the praise
of survivin' the day...
--- Unknown ---
Down where
Miss Kitty Farrelly is pourin' whiskey
and Frankie Donahughe is lighting her cigar.
A smokey den where workin' men don't bring the wife...
--- Unknown ---
It's the laughter of fellas with stories to tell,
men who love to get drunk and raise true feckin' hell!
--- Unknown ---
Ah, you come out with me and you'll see what you're missin' in life
--- Unknown ---
On the Streets of Dublin
On the Streets of Dublin
On the Streets of Dublin
