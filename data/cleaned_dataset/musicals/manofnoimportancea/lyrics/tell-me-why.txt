------ Tell Me Why ------
--- Unknown ---
To think that all these years
I never really knew you.
We sat across this table
And lived a lie.
--- Unknown ---
How stupid could I be?
To look, but never see?
--- Unknown ---
Now tell me why
I wasted half my life
and passed up all me chances.
I thought I could protect you
You let me try.
--- Unknown ---
How selfish and how cruel,
to cast me as your fool.
--- Unknown ---
Now tell me why
I still dream about a day,
I'm dancing at your wedding.
I catch your bride's bouquet,
and wave goodbye.
--- Unknown ---
And you my baby boy,
You're finally on your way.
You'll never see that day.
And, Alfie, nor will I.
--- Unknown ---
I see us sitting out our lives,
two people at a table.
Just like a faded picture,
In some old frame.
--- Unknown ---
You should have told me, Alfie,
Why did you never tell me?
--- Unknown ---
You must have known
