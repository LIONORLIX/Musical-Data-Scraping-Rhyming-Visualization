------ Love Who You Love ------
--- Unknown ---
I'm not one to lecture
How could I dare
Someone like me who's been mainly nowhere
But in my experience be as it may
You just have to love who you love
You just have to love who you love
--- Unknown ---
Your common sense tells ya best not begin
But your fool heart cannot help plungin in
And nothing and no one can stand in your way
You just have to love who you love
You just have to love who you love
--- Unknown ---
People can be hard sometimes
And their words can cut so deep
Choose the one you choose love
and don't lose a moment's sleep
Who can tell you who to want
Who can tell you what you were destined to be
Take it from me
--- Unknown ---
There's no fault in lovin
No call for shame
Everyone's heart does exactly the same
And once ya believe that, you'll learn how to say
I love who I love who I love
