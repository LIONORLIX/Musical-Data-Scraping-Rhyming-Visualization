Alfie: Bless me Father, for I have sinned
It's been a week since my last confession

Alfie: I swore at my sister once or twice, said some pretty bad words I suppose.
--- Unknown ---
Father Kenny: Is that all?
--- Unknown ---
Alfie: And I thought about killing my supervisor, a number of times
God knows...
--- Unknown ---
Father Kenny: Now you're talkin'.

Alfie: And I slept through your sermon, sorry Father, I don't know where I've been.
The way that my mind keeps wandering, Father... it's a sin.

Robbie: And he's struggling with his Catholic guilt and he's certain he's bound for hell.

Father Kenny: Is that all, my son?
