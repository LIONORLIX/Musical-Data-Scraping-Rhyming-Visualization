------ Dulcinea (Reprise) ------
--- ALDONZA ---
Dulcinea... Dulcinea...
Once you found a girl
And called her Dulcinea,
When you spoke the name
An angel seemed to whisper...
Dulcinea... Dulcinea...
--- Unknown ---
Dulcinea... Dulcinea...
Won't you please bring back
The dream of Dulcinea...
Won't you bring me back
The bright and shining glory
Of Dulcinea... Dulcinea...
--- DON QUIXOTE ---
Then perhaps... it was not a dream...
--- ALDONZA ---
You spoke of a dream. And about the Quest!
--- DON QUIXOTE ---
Quest?
--- ALDONZA ---
Yes, how you must fight and it doesn't matter whether
you win or lose if only you follow the Quest!
