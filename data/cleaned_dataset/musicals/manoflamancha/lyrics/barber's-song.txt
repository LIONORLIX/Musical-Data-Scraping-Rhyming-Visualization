------ Barber's Song ------
--- DON QUIXOTE ---
Someone approaches...!
--- SANCHO ---
Just an ordinary traveler.
--- DON QUIXOTE ---
But see what he wears upon his head.
Get thee to a place of hiding, Sancho.
--- SANCHO ---
Oh, dear!
--- BARBER ---
Oh, I am a little barber
And I go my merry way
With my razor and my leeches
I can always earn my pay
--- Unknown ---
Though your chin be smooth as satin,
You will need me soon I know
For the Lord protects his barbers,
And He makes the stubble grow.
--- Unknown ---
If I slip when I am shaving you
And cut you to the quick,
You can use me as a doctor
