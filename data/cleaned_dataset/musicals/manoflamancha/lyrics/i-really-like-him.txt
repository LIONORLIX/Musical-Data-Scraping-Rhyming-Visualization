------ I Really Like Him ------
--- SANCHO ---
I like him, I really like him.
Tear out my fingernails one by one, I like him!
I don't have a very good reason,
Since I've been with him,
Cuckoo-nuts have been in season...
But there's nothing I can do,
Chop me up for onion stew,
Still I'll yell to the sky
Though I can't tell you why,
That I like him!
--- ALDONZA ---
It doesn't make any sense!
--- SANCHO ---
That's because you're not a squire.
--- ALDONZA ---
All right, I'm not a squire. ]
Now does a squire squire?
--- SANCHO ---
Well, I ride behind him... and he fights.
Then I pick him up off the ground, and...
--- ALDONZA ---
But, what do you get out of it?
--- SANCHO ---
What do I get? Oh! Why, already I've gotten...
I've gotten...
--- ALDONZA ---
You've got nothing! Why do you do it?
--- SANCHO ---
I like him, I really like him.
Pluck me naked as a scalded chicken,
I like him!
Don't ask me for why or wherefore,
'Cause I don't have a single good
Because or therefore!
You can barbecue my nose.
Make a giblet of my toes,
Make me freeze, make me fry.
Make me sigh, make me cry.
Still I'll yell to the sky,
Though I can't tell you why.
