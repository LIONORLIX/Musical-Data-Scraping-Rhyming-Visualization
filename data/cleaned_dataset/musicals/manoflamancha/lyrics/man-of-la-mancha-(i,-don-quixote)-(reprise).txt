------ Man of La Mancha (I, Don Quixote) (Reprise) ------
--- DON QUIXOTE ---
Oh the trumpets of glory
Now call me to ride,
Yes, the trumpets are calling to me,
And wherever I ride,
Ever staunch at my side
My squire and my lady shall be!
I am I, Don Quixote...
--- DON QUIXOTE, ALDONZA, SANCHO ---
The Lord of la Mancha
My {Our} destiny calls and I {we} go!
And the wild winds of fortune Shall carry me {us} onward,
Oh, whithersoever...
--- ALDONZA ---
My Lord!
--- SANCHO ---
Master!
--- DON QUIXOTE ---
Whithersoever they blow
Onward to glory... aah!... I... go...
--- ALDONZA ---
My Lord...
--- SANCHO ---
He is dead.
My master is dead.
--- ALDONZA ---
A man died.
He seemed a good man, but I did not know him,
--- SANCHO ---
But...
--- ALDONZA ---
Don Quixote is not dead. Believe, Sancho, believe.
--- SANCHO ---
Aldonza...
--- ALDONZA ---
