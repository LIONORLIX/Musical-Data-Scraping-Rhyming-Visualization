------ Dulcinea ------
--- DON QUIXOTE ---
Sweet lady... fair virgin...
--- Unknown ---
(Don Quixote averts his eyes worshipfully)
I dare not gaze full upon thy countenance
Lest I be blinded by beauty. But I implore
Thee - speak once thy name.
--- ALDONZA ---
Aldonza.
--- DON QUIXOTE ---

--- DON QUIXOTE ---
The name of a kitchen-scullion... or perhaps my
lady's serving-maid?
--- ALDONZA ---

--- DON QUIXOTE ---
Did my lady think to put me to a test?
Ah, sweet sovereign of my captive heart. I shall
not fail thee, for I know...
--- Unknown ---
I have dreamed thee too long,
Never seen thee or touched thee.
But known thee with all of my heart.
Half a prayer, half a song,
Thou hast always been with me,
Though we have been always apart.
--- Unknown ---
Dulcinea... Dulcinea...
I see heaven when I see thee, Dulcinea,
And thy name is like a prayer
An angel whispers... Dulcinea... Dulcinea!
--- Unknown ---
If I reach out to thee,
Do not tremble and shrink
From the touch of my hand on thy hair.
Let my fingers but see
Thou art warm and alive,
And no phantom to fade in the air.
--- Unknown ---
Dulcinea... Dulcinea...
I have sought thee, sung thee,
Dreamed thee, Dulcinea!
--- Unknown ---
Now I've found thee,
And the world shall know thy glory,
Dulcinea... Dulcinea!
--- Unknown ---
