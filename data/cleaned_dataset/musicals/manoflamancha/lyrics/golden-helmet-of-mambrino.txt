------ Golden Helmet of Mambrino ------
--- DON QUIXOTE ---
Hand over that golden helmet!
--- BARBER ---
But this is a shaving basin!
--- DON QUIXOTE ---
Shaving basin! Know thou not what this really is?
The Golden Helmet of Mambrino!
When worn by one of noble heart, it renders
him invulnerable to all wounds!
Hand it over!
--- Unknown ---
Thou Golden Helmet of Mambrino,
With so illustrious a past,
Too long hast thou been lost to glory,
Th'art rediscovered now at last!
Golden Helmet of Mambrino
There can be no hat like thee!
Thou and I now, ere I die now,
Will make golden history!
--- BARBER ---
I can hear the cuckoo singing
In the cuckooberry tree...
--- SANCHO ---
If he says that that's a helmet,
I suggest that you agree...
--- BARBER ---
But he'll find it is not gold
And will not make him bold and brave...
--- SANCHO ---
Well, at least he'll find it useful
If he ever needs a shave!
--- DON QUIXOTE ---
Thou Golden Helmet of Mambrino,
Thy deeds the world will not forget,
Now Don Quixote de La Mancha,
Will bring thee greater glory yet!
--- DON QUIXOTE, BARBER, SANCHO, MULETEERS ---
Golden Helmet of Mambrino
There can be no hat like thee.
--- DON QUIXOTE ---
Thou and I now, ere I die now,
Will make golden history!
--- BARBER, SANCHO, MULETEERS ---
