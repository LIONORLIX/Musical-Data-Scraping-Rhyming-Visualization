------ Pure Imagination ------
--- Unknown ---
Come with me and you'll be in a world of pure imagination!
Take a look and you'll see into your imagination!

We'll begin with a spin, travelling in the world of my creation!
What you'll see will defy explanation!

If you want to view paradise, simply look around and view it!
Anything you want to, do it!
Want to change the world?
There's nothing to it!
--- Unknown ---
There is no life I know to compare with pure imagination!
Living here, you'll be free if you truly wish to be!
