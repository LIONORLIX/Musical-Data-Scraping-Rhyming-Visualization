------ It Must Be Believed to Be Seen (Reprise) ------
--- WILLY WONKA ---
There comes a time to leave the past behind you
And amongst you, is as good a place to hide
So out there in the shadows I remind you
That may be, Willy Wonka, by your side...
--- Unknown ---
And so, my friend, my factory
Continue your routine
Let's say goodbye, for to new worlds I fly,
That are not yet conceived
And are not yet achieved
And they must be believed -- to be
Seen...
