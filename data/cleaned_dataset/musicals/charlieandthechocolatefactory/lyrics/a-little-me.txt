Mr. Grouper (singing): It's all the things you aren't that make you what you are.

Mr. Grouper (singing): It's all the things you aren't that make you what you are.
You have to dig a hole to plant the tree.
It's the books you've yet to read, it's the dough you've yet to knead,
that makes you you and... a little me!

Martin and Dot (singing): With sparks of sweets you'll soon invent!

--- Unknown ---
Mr. Grouper (singing): A Grouper through and through!
--- Unknown ---
All (singing): That makes you you! And in the middle of a riddle where a kid'll be a little...
