------ Bikini Bottom Boogie ------
--- ELECTRIC SKATES ---
If you wanna rock and feel it alright
Bikini Bottom boogie all night
Hanging 680, sweet, rad, gnarly and tight
Bikini Bottom Boogie all night

Toe side, heel side, how do I look?
It doesn't really matter 'cause it's so off the hook
Faux haired, short haired, mohawk or bald
Or shavin' off your dorsals when your grandmama called
There's no magic potion, we'll jump in the ocean blue
Wa-wa-ooh

If you wanna rock and feel it alright
Bikini Bottom boogie all night
Hanging 680, sweet, rad, gnarly and tight
Bikini Bottom boogie all night

Ridin' like a squidley [?] may be so outta sight
But we'll be sweet poppin' bongo on a seahorse tonight
You snooze, you're gonna lose, you better make your wish
With this fin I'm gonna win so you can kiss my jellyfish
There's no magic potion, we'll jump in the ocean blue (jump in the ocean blue)
Wa-wa-ooh

Throw up your hands, throw up your fins
In Bikini Bottom, baby, everybo-bo-body wins
So if you wanna rock and feel it alright
Bikini Bottom boogie all night
Bikini Bottom boogie all night
Bikini Bottom boogie all night
