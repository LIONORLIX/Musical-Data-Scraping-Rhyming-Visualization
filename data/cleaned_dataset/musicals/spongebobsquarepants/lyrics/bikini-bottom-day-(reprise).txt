------ Bikini Bottom Day (Reprise) ------

You're right; I have to pull myself together. Pull it together, self! We have a town to save.
--- Unknown ---
Can't stay in bed
One final morning I can spend with Gary
--- GARY ---
Meow.
--- SPONGEBOB ---
Big day ahead
Two parts impossible and three parts scary
Gary, you know
Climbing a killer mountain won't be easy
Eh, I just won't go...
--- GARY ---
[HISSING]
--- SPONGEBOB ---
Okay, I know! Bikini Bottom needs me
And look at all these ropes and these hammers that you got me somehow
Gary, you're the greatest! Where'd you get this stuff?
--- GARY ---
Meow.
--- SPONGEBOB ---
I'm ready, thanks to you
I know that I can do it
For the world renowned
Bikini Bottom
Gonna save this town
Bikini Bottom
I just won't look down
On this maybe last Bikini Bottom day
