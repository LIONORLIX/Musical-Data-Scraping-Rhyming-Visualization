------ Just a Simple Sponge ------
--- SPONGEBOB ---
Sure, I spend my days floating around
Head in the bubbles and my feet on the ground
But there is more to me than just my name
Give me a chance and I could change the game
--- Unknown ---
And maybe one day Mr. Krabs would say
The Krusty Krab's yours, it's your lucky day
That is what I've always wanted,
Then I can finally say I've done it
--- Unknown ---
Let me have adventure
Be a contender and more
--- SPONGES ---
'Cause you're not a simple sponge
--- SPONGEBOB ---
I wish he'd see I'm not just the sponge next door
--- SPONGES ---
No, you're not a simple sponge
--- SPONGEBOB ---
There's gotta be a better way
A way to save this town I love
But how can I stop the end of the world?
Am I just a simple sponge?
--- SPONGES ---
No, you're not a simple sponge
No, you're not a simple sponge
--- SPONGEBOB ---
So what if I'm a sponge? It's what I wanna be
There isn't anyone who stretches like me
Employee of the month two years in a row
Undisputed master of my own dojo
--- Unknown ---
And everyone here knows that they can depend
On this expert jellyfisher who's a trusted friend
I can eat a lot of ice cream
I can even play my nose like [FLUTE TRILL]
--- Unknown ---
Let me have adventure
Be a contender and more
--- SPONGES ---
'Cause you're not a simple sponge
--- SPONGEBOB ---
Can't he see I'm not just the sponge next door?
--- SPONGES ---
No, you're not a simple—
--- SPONGEBOB ---
I wish that I could turn back time
I never thought my world could end
I only wanna hang out with my friends
But fear, I fear, is dragging us down
--- ALL ---
And now there's panic that's run amok
--- SPONGEBOB ---
In my simple town
--- SPONGES ---
No, no, no, no
--- SPONGEBOB ---
No!
Just give me adventure
Be a contender and more
--- SPONGES ---
'Cause you're not a simple sponge
--- SPONGEBOB ---
I'm real sure I'm not just the sponge next door
--- SPONGES ---
No, you're not a simple sponge
--- SPONGEBOB ---
I'm gonna find a better way
A way to save this life I love
And I am gonna stop the end of the—
--- MR. KRABS ---
No!
You're just a simple sponge
--- SPONGEBOB ---
You're wrong, Mr. Krabs. I'll find a way to stop that volcano from erupting.
--- MR. KRABS ---
You are still a simple sponge
--- SPONGEBOB ---
I'll use science, like Sandy said. I'm gonna need her on the team.
--- MR. KRABS ---
'Cause you're just a simple sponge
--- SPONGEBOB ---
And Patrick, too; he's super strong.
We'll be the best team ever! Sandy's brains, plus Patrick's brawn, plus my...
--- MR. KRABS ---
Yes, a very simple sponge
--- SPONGEBOB ---
Well, I'm not sure what my thing is, but that won't stop me.
When the going gets tough, this sponge gets going!
--- SPONGEBOB ---
No, I'm not a simple sponge
--- SPONGES ---
Let me have adventure
Be a contender and more
--- SPONGEBOB ---
I am not a simple sponge
--- SPONGES ---
I'll make him see I'm not just the sponge next door
--- ALL ---
Yeah, yeah, yeah
--- SPONGEBOB ---
Now at last, I have found a way
A way to save this town I love
I am not
--- ALL ---
A simple sponge
