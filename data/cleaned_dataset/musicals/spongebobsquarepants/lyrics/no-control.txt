------ No Control ------
--- SPONGEBOB, PATRICK, & SANDY ---
The end is coming!
The end is coming!
The end! Is! Coming!
--- PERCH PERKINS ---
This just in:
The end is in our future
Evidence has come to light
It's all deranged
No control
--- Unknown ---
Sit tight in your corner
No point in making plans
It's all deranged
No control (no control, no control)
--- SANDY ---
The science is clear
I'm afraid it's true
--- SPONGEBOB ---
The end's really here
--- PATRICK ---
There's nothing we can do
--- SANDY ---
And if I read these numbers right
Our time is up
--- SANDY, PATRICK, & SPONGEBOB ---
Tomorrow night
--- PERCH PERKINS ---
Time runs out tomorrow (time runs out tomorrow)
Terror in our final hours (ohhh)
It's all deranged (it's all deranged)
No control (no control, no control)
--- MR. KRABS ---
The lava will flow
And we'll burn when it does
Just ashes and smoke
Where me money once was
--- PLANKTON ---
There's gotta be a scheme
There's gotta be a plan
--- KAREN ---
I think we should run
While we still can (ohhh, while we-)
--- ALL ---
No control!
The end is in our future
No point in making plans
It's all deranged
No control
--- SPONGEBOB ---
Everyone's so scared and sad
Just one volcano, that's not so bad
Until Bikini Bottom's gone
Let's all keep calm and carry on
--- Unknown ---
[SHRIEK] No control
I can't believe I've no control
It's all deranged
I can't believe I've no control
--- ALL ---
It's coming
The end is coming, the end is coming
The end is coming
The end is coming, the end is coming
