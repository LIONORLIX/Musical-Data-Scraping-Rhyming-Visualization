------ Best Day Ever ------
--- Unknown ---
Just six more minutes left
We've done all we could do
And whatever happens next
I'm glad I'm here with you
--- Unknown ---
Mr. Sun came up and he smiled at me
He said, It's gonna be the best day, just wait and see
Volcanic doomsday caught us unaware
But we're still here and Mr. Sun's up there
It's the best day ever! (best day ever)
It's the best day ever! (best day ever)
--- Unknown ---
I'm so lucky, got nothing to do
I could spend five minutes just being with you
Every flower, every grain of sand
Is reaching out to shake my hand
It's the best day ever! (best day ever)
It's the best day ever! (best day ever)
--- Unknown ---
These past two days, the world's
Been closing in on me
When I'm feeling down
I wanna lose that frown
I stick my head out the window
And I look around
--- Unknown ---
Lava doesn't scare me, it can't disguise
This magic that's happening right before my eyes
Whatever comes is just one thing to do
To make the best day ever with all of you
Today's the best day ever with all of you
--- Unknown ---
It's the best day ever! (best day ever)
It's the best day ever! (best day ever)
It's the best day ever! (best day ever)
It's the best day ever! (best day ever)
