------ Bikini Bottom Day ------
--- SPONGEBOB ---
Good morning world, and all who inhabit it!
--- Unknown ---
Jump out of bed
Mix up a breakfast for my favorite pet snail
--- GARY ---
Meow.
--- SPONGEBOB ---
Full steam ahead
The S.S. I Am Ready is about to set sail
This kind of day
Couldn't get much better but it keeps on trying
I'm on my way
Somewhere there's a Krabby Patty that needs frying
--- Unknown ---
Who's the lucky sponge in the mirror who is living his dream?
Who's always extra careful with his dental hygiene?
Gary, it's me
Happy just to be here
--- Unknown ---
In the world renowned
Bikini Bottom
How I love this town
Bikini Bottom
Where the sun shines down
On a beautiful Bikini Bottom day
--- Unknown ---
"Good morning, Patrick!"
--- PATRICK ---
[YAWN] Is it morning already?
--- SPONGEBOB ---
It sure is, and I'm singing the opening number.
--- PATRICK ---
Ooh, I want a verse!
--- Unknown ---
I missed a snack
This busy schedule makes it hard to feed me
To stay on track
Now I'll have to eat it while I'm watching T.V.
--- Unknown ---
There might not be time for a nap
But I'll do what I can
They're showing all the episodes of
--- PATRICK & SPONGEBOB ---
Mermaid Man
--- PATRICK ---
Oh, every single one!
I'm spending all day underneath
My favorite rock (favorite rock)
--- SPONGEBOB ---
Bikini Bottom
--- PATRICK ---
Now, what rhymes with rock? (rhymes with rock)
--- SPONGEBOB ---
Bikini Bottom
--- PATRICK ---
Nothing rhymes with rock (rhymes with rock)
It's a typical Bikini Bottom day
--- SQUIDWARD ---
Would you two please keep it down?
--- SPONGEBOB & PATRICK ---
Good morning, Squidward!
--- SQUIDWARD ---
Another day, another migraine.
--- Unknown ---
When I want some quiet, there's nowhere to go
A sensitive artiste
Can't get a moment's peace
With these two idiots in stereo
They never go away (never go away)
Typical Bikini Bottom day
--- NARRATOR ---
We now follow Spongebob past the Treedome, home to Sandy Cheeks the squirrel,
Hard at work on her latest invention. [EXPLOSION]
--- SANDY ---
Boy howdy, that was close
It's just a little smoke, a minor setback (setback)
A few more hours at most
And I'll be done with this here brand-new jetpack (jetpack)
--- Unknown ---
And then this Texas squirrel, this country girl
Will spread her wings and fly
Her bushy tail and comet's trail
Will clear across the sky
Above the town and looking down
On a typical Bikini Bottom day (day, day). Yeah
--- Unknown ---
SPONGEBOB (SPOKEN)
Bye Sandy! I'm off to work, at the Krusty Krab!
--- NARRATOR ---
Ah yes, Bikini Bottom's most popular dining establishment,
home to the Krabby Patty, owned and operated by Mr. Eugene Krabs. And across town,
the least popular restaurant: the Chum Bucket, run by Sheldon J. Plankton.
Two arch nemeses locked in their fast food Cold War.
--- MR. KRABS ---
Winds from the west
Everywhere you look the skies are clear and sunny
Good weather's best
When you're in the mood to make a ton of money [LAUGHTER]
--- PLANKTON ---
Laugh while you can
Until the day you laugh no more forever
--- KAREN ---
Forever
--- PLANKTON ---
I've got a plan
And I went to college so you know it's clever
--- MR. KRABS ---
They say that money doesn't matter if you love your work— HA!
Who would say that? Probably some penniless jerk
--- PLANKTON ---
Soon the day will come
When they'll all love chum
It's just a matter of time
--- KAREN & MR. KRABS ---
Bikini Bottom
--- PLANKTON ---
'Till I get them in line
--- KAREN & MR.KRABS ---
Bikini Bottom
--- PLANKTON ---
And this town is all mine!
--- PLANKTON, KAREN, & MR.KRABS ---
Just a typical Bikini Bottom day!
--- Unknown ---
Spongebob reporting for duty at the greatest restaurant in the entire ocean!
Where's Mr. Krabs?
--- SQUIDWARD ---
It's 'Take Your Kid To Work' Day.
--- MR. KRABS ---
Just think, Pearl, me darling daughter; one day this will all be yours.
Soon as you graduate high school, I'll start you as manager.
--- PEARL ---
But I have my own dreams, Daddy!
--- SPONGEBOB ---
Uh, Mr. Krabs, If she doesn't want to be manager, I know someone who'd be great for the job.
--- MR. KRABS ---
You?
--- MR. KRABS ---
My boy, you're just a wee, simple sponge. A frycook is all you'll ever be.
--- SPONGEBOB ---
Why can't he see?
I wore my good shoes and I've got my tie on
Maybe it's me
Am I just a simple sponge you can't rely on?
--- Unknown ---
Come on, Mr. Krabs, I can do it if you give me one chance
Then everyone would say, Good morning, Mr. Squarepants!
I would never rest
Until I was the best—
--- MR. KRABS ---
Spongebob, get in the kitchen! It's opening time!
--- ALL ---
In the world renowned (world renowned)
Bikini Bottom
Our old home town (old home town)
Bikini Bottom
And the sun shines down, sun shines down, sun shines down, sun shines down.
It's a typical
