I've been thinkin' how to get to the top of the mountain
It's gonna take a whole lotta determination
You've gotta chop to the top if you want it
Just go ahead and give it a try
I know you're scared, just be brave, you can do it
You gotta give it all you got inside and

Chop to the top
Chop to the top
Come on and
Keep it moving, don't stop 'til ya drop
Come on and CHOP!
Come on and CHOP!

Sometimes you just gotta kick all that fear away
Courage with a good attitude goes a long, long way
