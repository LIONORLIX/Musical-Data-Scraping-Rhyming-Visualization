I got you
And you got me
I don't need my glasses on
To see we're both pretty lucky
Stuck inside
With no T.V.
Being bored with you makes me
As happy as can be

Let's have some fun together
We'll be best friends forever
B.F.F., that stands for us

Life is sweet
There's snacks we can eat
--- SPONGEBOB ---
We'll have fun if we go out
And just sit around doing nothing
Let's explore
Open every drawer
--- PATRICK ---
Hey, you found my long-lost cheese
--- SPONGEBOB ---
That's what friends are for!
Let's have some fun together
--- PATRICK ---
You're my best friend forever

We're best friends and this is the friend dance!
We're best friends and this is the friend dance
We're best friends and this is the friend dance
WE'RE BEST FRIENDS AND—

Every little thing that I can think of doing
Just sounds better
Doing it together
Every little thing that I can think of doing
Just sounds better
Doing it together
Doing it with you

Floating high
Like a bubble in the sky
Feeling good just like I should
And you're the reason why
Let's have some fun together
--- SPONGEBOB & PATRICK ---
We'll be best friends forever
B.F.F., that stands for us
This can't get any better
You're my best friend forever
B.F.F., that stands for us
B.F.F., that stands for us
B.F.F., that stands for...
