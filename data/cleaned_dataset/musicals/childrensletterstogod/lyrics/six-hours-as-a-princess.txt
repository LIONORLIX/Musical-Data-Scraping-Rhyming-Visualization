------ Six Hours as a Princess ------
--- Joanna ---
(Spoken) Dear God....Are boys better than girls? I know you are one, but try to be fair.
--- Unknown ---
(Sung)Cinderella had her godmother. But I'm lucky that I have you.
So maybe I don't need a glass shoe to make my wish come true..
--- Unknown ---
I want six hours as a Princess.
I'd take five or even three.
Yes, three hours as a Princess.
Just the two of us, Brett and me.
--- Unknown ---
And we'll talk about hopes and dreams.
Not sports, imagine that!
And soon I'll find what's on his mind, and underneath that hat.
--- Unknown ---
I want one hour as a Princess.
Don't you think I'm allowed.
Just one hour as a Princess?
Okay, ten minutes, I'm not proud!
--- Unknown ---
And the night will be filled with stars.
And he'll be holding my hand.
And Brett will say he cares for me, because that's what you'll command.
--- Unknown ---
Then finally the girl I hoped to be will magically appear.
God, you can make my dream come true...
Just send me a sign to let me know you're there.
