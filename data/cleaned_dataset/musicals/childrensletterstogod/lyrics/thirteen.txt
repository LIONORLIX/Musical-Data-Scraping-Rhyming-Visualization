(Spoken)
Dear God...How do you feel about people who don't believe in you?
Somebody else wants to know.
--- Unknown ---
Cake and ice cream and party favors.
Playing games with friends - Big wow.
Why is it things I loved last year seem so stupid now?
--- Unknown ---
Dad moves out on November Seventh;
I grew an inch-and-a-half last spring.
So many changes in one year.
Wonder what next year will bring?
--- Unknown ---
Turn thirteen and things go crazy..
Felling like a total freak!
Voice is getting lower, school year's getting slower,
and I'm shaving every other week!
--- Unknown ---
Dad moved out on November seventh;
Mom threw out her wedding ring.
So man changes in one year...
Wonder what next year will bring?
