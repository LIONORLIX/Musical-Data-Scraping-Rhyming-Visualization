------ Questions for the Rain ------
--- Unknown ---
KICKER (spoken)
Dear God...Last week it rained so much it was almost like Noah's Ark.
But I'm glad it wasn't 'cause you could only take two of things, remember?
And we have three cats!
--- IRIS ---
What did people do before umbrellas?
--- THEO ---
Do fish have a clue that it's raining?
--- BRETT ---
Why's it always fall on
Some important baseball game?
--- JOANNA ---
How come flowers grow...
--- KICKER ---
But I just stay the same?
--- THEO ---
Can't you make it so it skips the weekends?
--- IRIS ---
Does rain mean
That you might be crying?
--- JOANNA ---
Is it like the snow:
Are no two raindrops alike?
--- THEO ---
Why does it turn grass green...
--- BRETT ---
But it just rusts my bike?
--- ALL ---
Questions for the rain
While thunderclaps are ringing
--- THEO ---
Why does Daddy curse it...
--- JOANNA ---
But in movies they start singing?
--- ALL ---
Why's it always clear?
Is it tears disguised?
--- KICKER ---
Is it safe to drink?
--- BRETT ---
Should we wait till it's pasteurized?
--- ALL ---
Quesetions for the rain...
Some things I sometimes wonder...
Which is it more fond of:
The lightning or the thunder?
--- IRIS ---
Does the sun get wet,
Or does the rain pass right through it?
--- THEO ---
When you make it rain
How do you know how long to do it?
--- ALL ---
Questions for the rain...

JOANNA (spoken)
What's the matter?
--- Unknown ---
IRIS (spoken)
Arnold's not moving! I think he's...dead!
--- Unknown ---
KICKER (spoken)
Really? Dead? Wow! How can you tell?
--- Unknown ---
BRETT (spoken)
Turtles look dead even when they're alive!
--- Unknown ---
JOANNA (spoken)
Oh, Brett!
--- Unknown ---
BRETT (spoken)
Let me take his pulse.
--- Unknown ---
KICKER (spoken)
I never saw anything dead before...except an ant.
--- Unknown ---
BRETT (spoken)
Yep. He's dead all right.
--- Unknown ---
(Iris sobs)
--- Unknown ---
JOANNA (spoken)
Some people think we live after we die.
--- Unknown ---
BRETT (spoken)
Forget it.
--- Unknown ---
IRIS (spoken)
If we live after we die, why do we have to die then?
--- Unknown ---
THEO (spoken)
Maybe it was his time.
--- Unknown ---
IRIS (spoken)
It's not fair! If I was God I would let everybody's turtle live forever!
--- Unknown ---
BRETT (spoken)
Nobody lives forever.
--- Unknown ---
KICKER (spoken)
Dear God...What is it like when you die? I just want to know, I don't want to do it.
--- Unknown ---
JOANNA (spoken)
It's sad, but you were lucky you had such a great turtle.
--- Unknown ---
IRIS (spoken)
Dear God...Instead of letting people die and having to make new ones,
why don't you just keep the ones you've got now?
--- Unknown ---
ALL (except Iris)
God, we give you thanks
Just like on Thanksgiving...
--- IRIS ---
But I'd be more thankful
If my friend was living.
--- THEO ---
Was he in much pain?
He looks awful green!
--- BRETT ---
Arnold was a turtle
They are always green!
--- IRIS ---
Oh, why did you take him in his prime?!
--- THEO ---
Was he really that young?
--- IRIS ---
I'd say he was maybe three or so...
With turtles it's kind of hard to know.
--- Unknown ---
JOANNA (spoken)
And so we lay to rest Iris Chang's eloved turtle,
Arnold Chang.
--- KICKER ---
Is there such a thing as turtle heaven?
--- THEO ---
Will Arnold come back as a rabbit?
--- IRIS ---
Will I ever see my littel friend again?
P.S. There's no rushs...
Remember, I'm just ten.
--- KICKER ---
If he's wet, will he get
Pneumonia?
--- THEO ---
Why am I hungry for French fries?
--- JOANNA ---
Even though he's gone,
Is it still helpful to pray?
--- BRETT ---
If the rain won't stop
Will Arnold float away...?
--- ALL ---
Questions for the rain...
I'm happy to have known him.
--- IRIS ---
Don't mean to complain, but
Is it too late to clone him?
--- ALL ---
He will always be
Turtle number one,
The very best of friends...
We sure had lots of fun.
--- IRIS ---
Thank you for my Arnold...
--- ALL ---
And thank you for the sun.
