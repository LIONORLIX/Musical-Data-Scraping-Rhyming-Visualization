IRIS (spoken)
Dear God...Why can't there be another holiday between Christmas and Easter.
There is nothing good in there now.

JOANNA (spoken)
Dear God...Our teacher read us the part where all the Jews went through the water and got away.
Keep up the good work. P.S.
I'm Jewish.

KICKER (spoken)
Dear God...With so many different religions, don't you get mixed up sometimes?
--- IRIS ---
Fa la la la la la la la!
Let's sing a simple holiday song:
Fa la la Fa la la la la la!
Baby Jesus born in a manger...
--- Unknown ---
ALL (except Iris)
Not so fast:
I may be a stranger
To your kind of holiday song.
--- IRIS ---
Sing a simple holiday song:
Fa la la Fa la...
--- JOANNA ---
Not for me.
Spinning dreidels, dancing a horah,
Chant in Heberw, light the menorah:
Baruch ata adonai eloheinu melech haolam...
That's our simple holiday song.
--- THEO ---
But what of Kwanzaa?
You can't forget Kwanzaa.
From an old Swahili phrase,
It lasts I think for seven days.
--- IRIS ---
Mine lasts for twelve...
--- JOANNA ---
Mine lasts for eight.
--- BRETT ---
At least you get to celebrate!
--- Sing a simple holiday song ---
Fa la la Fa la la la la...la!
Mom on Christmas,
Dad is on New Year's...
I drink cider,
He has a few beers.
--- Unknown ---
You get pretty used to it all
When you're a holiday volley ball.
--- KICKER ---
Sing a simple holiday song:
Fa la la Fa la la la la!
Sing of joy this season for giving...
All those gifts are reason for living!
--- ALL ---
Hallelujah!
Hallelujah!
--- KICKER ---
All is Toys R Us, dot com,
All is bright.
--- IRIS ---
So sing of king of kings
