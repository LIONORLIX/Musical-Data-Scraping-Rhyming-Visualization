Dear God...Do animals believe in you or is there somebody else for them?

IRIS (spoken)
Did you mean for giraffes to look so funny or was that a mistake?
--- Unknown ---
THEO (spoken)
Dear God...I hope ants are not special because we squish them all the time.

How I love to squish ants!
How I love to stomp ants!
Who gave 'em permission
To crawl up my pants?!
--- Unknown ---
How I love to smash ants!
How I love to mash ants!
That is why I gotta do
My squishy ants' dance!
--- Unknown ---
How I hate any bug,
Every spider and slug.
Every time I see one, I wanna yell Ugh!
It's always kind of messy when you
Squish 'em on a rug...
But I love to squish ants!

Hi Munchkin.

KICKER (spoken)
Where are you going?
--- Unknown ---
BRETT (spoken)
To check out the new roller coaster.
--- Unknown ---
KICKER (spoken)
Can I go?
--- Unknown ---
JOANNA (spoken)
You're too little.
--- Unknown ---
BRETT (spoken)
And too shrimpy. Hey, Kicker, you're good at kicking people. Let's see if you can catch.
--- Unknown ---
JOANNA (spoken)
Yeah, Kicker, catch!
--- Unknown ---
KICKER (spoken)
Ow!
--- Unknown ---
BRETT (spoken)
Wow! What a great backboard!
--- Unknown ---
JOANNA (spoken)
Hey! Be nice to my little brother!
--- Unknown ---
KICKER (spoken)
Yeh, dorkhead!
--- Unknown ---
JOANNA (spoken)
I'm the only one who's allowed to torture him!
--- Unknown ---
BRETT (spoken)
Bye, squirt!
--- KICKER ---
I will never squish ants...
I will only help ants.
Just like little people,
Ants deserve a chance!
Remember, ev'ry bug
Deep down just wants a hug.
--- Unknown ---
No one likes being crept on,
But it's worse getting stepped on.
I will never, never, never, never, never, never, ever
Squish ants!
