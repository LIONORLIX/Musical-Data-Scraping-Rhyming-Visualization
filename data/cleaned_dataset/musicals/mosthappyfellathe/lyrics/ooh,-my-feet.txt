------ Ooh, My Feet ------
--- Unknown ---
Ooh my feet! My poor, poor feet!
Betcha your life a waitress earns her pay
I've been on my feet, my poor, poor feet
All day long today.
--- Unknown ---
Oooh my toes! My poor, poor toes!
How can I give the service with the smile
When I'm on my toes, my poor, poor toes
Mile after mile after mile after mile
After mile?
--- Unknown ---
This little piggy's only broken
This little piggy's on the bum
This little piggy's in the middle
Consequently, absolutely numb.
This little piggy
Feels the weight of the plate
Though the freights
Just an order of melba toast
And this little piggy
Is the littlest little piggy
But the big son-of-a-bitch
Hurts the most!
--- Unknown ---
Ooooh my feet! My poor, poor feet!
Betcha your life a waitress earns her pay
I've been on my feet, my poor, poor feet
All day long today.
