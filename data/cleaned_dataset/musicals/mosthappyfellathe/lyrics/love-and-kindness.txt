------ Love and Kindness ------
--- Easy ---
Take medicine, take tonic, take pills
But none of them will cure and old
Grouch of his ills.
If you've got to take something,
Take a precription

Love and kindness
From the nurse
The good looking nurse.

Take love and kindness
Love and kindness,
And you will never, ever
Take a turn for the worse.

She's good for what ails you
When you feel ready to hollor and curse.
