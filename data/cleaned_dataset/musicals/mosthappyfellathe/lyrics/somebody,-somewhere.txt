------ Somebody, Somewhere ------
--- Unknown ---
Wanting to be wanted,
Needing to be needed,
That's what it is,
That's what it is.
Now I'm lucky that
--- Unknown ---
Somebody, somewhere
Wants me and needs me
That's very wonderful to know
Somebody lonely wants me to care
Wants me off all people to notice him there
Well, I want to be wanted
Need to be needed
And I'll admit I'm all aglow
'Cause somebody somewhere
Wants me and needs me
Wants lonely me to smile and say hello
Somebody, somewhere
Wants me and needs me
