------ I Made A Fist ------
--- Unknown ---
I made a fist!
I made a fist!
I folded up the fingers of my left hand
And there it was
Exactly at the end of my wrist!
--- Unknown ---
Herman, my hero! Herman, my hero!
--- Unknown ---
I made afrown!
I made a frown!
It started with a pucker in my eyebrows
I got so mad
The corners of my mouth turned down!
--- Unknown ---
Herman, my hero!
--- Unknown ---
And I can lick anybody in town!
Since I made a fist and a frown!
--- Unknown ---
Herman, my hero! Herman, my hero!
