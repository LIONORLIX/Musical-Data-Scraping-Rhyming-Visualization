Standing on the corner
Watching all the girls go by
Standing on the corner
Watching all the girls go by
--- Unknown ---
Brother you don't know
A nicer occupation
Matter of fact neither do I
--- Unknown ---
Than standing on the corner
watching all the girls,
watching all the girls ,
watching all the girls go by
--- Unknown ---
I'm the cat that cot the cream
Haven't got a girl, but I can dream
Haven't got a girl, but I can wish,
So I take me down to Main Street
And that's where I select my
Imaginary dish!
--- Unknown ---
Standing on the corner
Watching all the girls go by
Standing on the corner
Watching all the girls go by
--- Unknown ---
Brother, if you've got
A rich imagination
Give it a whirl, give it a try,
--- Unknown ---
Try standing on the corner
watching all the girls,
watching all the girls ,
watching all the girls go by
--- Unknown ---
Saturday and I'm so broke
Couldn't buy a girl a nickel coke
Still I'm living like a millionaire
When I take me down to Main Street
And I receive the harem
Parading for me there
--- Unknown ---
Standing on the corner
Watching all the girls go by.
Standing on the corner
Underneath a springtime sky.
--- Unknown ---
Brother you can't go to jail
For what you're thinking
Or for the oooh! look in your eye
--- Unknown ---
You're only standing on the corner
Watching all the girls,
Watching all the girls,
