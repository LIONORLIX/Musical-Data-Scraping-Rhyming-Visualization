------ Warm All Over ------
--- Unknown ---
Where's that smile?
Where's that glow?
Where's that happy face
That I depend on so,
Or didn't you know?
It makes me feel
--- Unknown ---
Warm all over,
Warm all over
Ev'ry time you smile
You get me warm all over.
Sometimes I feel kind of out in the cold
But then I touch your hand
And I'm home, home again
And warm all over,
Gone are all the clouds that used to
Swarm all over.
Please, always let me keep feeling the way I do.
So warm all over
