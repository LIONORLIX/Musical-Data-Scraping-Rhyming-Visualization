------ Joey, Joey, Joey ------
--- Unknown ---
Like a perfumed woman,
The wind blows in the bunk-house
Like a perfumed woman,
Smellin' of where she's been.
Smellin' of oregon cherries
Or maybe Texas avocado
Or maybe Arizona sugar beet.
The wind blows in
And she sings to me,
'Cause I'm one of her ramblin' kin.
She sings:
--- Unknown ---
Joey, Joey, Joey
Joey, Joey, Joe
You've been too long in one place
And it's time to go, time to go!
--- Unknown ---
Joey, Joey, Joey
Joey, traveled on
You've been too long in one town
And the harvest time's come and gone.
That's what the wind sings to me
When the bunk I've bunkin' in
Gets to feelin' too soft and cozy,
When the grub they're been cookin' me
Gets to tastin' too good,
When I've had all I want
Of the ladies in the neighborhood.
She sings:
--- Unknown ---
Joey, Joey, Joey
Joey, Joey, Joe
You've been too long in one place
And it's time to go, time to go!
