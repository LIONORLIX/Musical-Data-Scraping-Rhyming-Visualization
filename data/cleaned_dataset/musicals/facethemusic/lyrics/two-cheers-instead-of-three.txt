------ Two Cheers Instead of Three ------
--- VERSE: ---
It's smart to be thrifty when times are so bad
Let's be patriotic, but let's not go mad
We must cheer the colors we prize
So here's what I strongly advise
--- REFRAIN: ---
We'll just have two cheers instead of three
For the land of the brave and the free
--- Unknown ---
Instead of three cheers, we'll just have two
For the red and the white and the blue
--- Unknown ---
So when we cheer the stars and stripes here's what we'll do
We'll cheer the red and cheer the white but not the blue
--- Unknown ---
And just have two cheers instead of three
For the land of the brave and the free
--- PATTER: ---
Why give them three cheers when two will more than do?
If there must be cheers then let there just be two
And the speeches that you make to Uncle Sam
