------ Soft Lights and Sweet Music ------
--- VERSE: ---
I can't resist the moan of a cello
I can't resist the light of the moon
So place me in a light that is mellow
And let me hear a beautiful tune
The music must flow
The lights must be low
--- REFRAIN: ---
Soft lights and sweet music
And you in my arms
--- Unknown ---
Soft lights and sweet melody
Will bring you closer to me
--- Unknown ---
Chopin and pale moonlight
Reveal all your charms
--- Unknown ---
So give me velvet lights and sweet music
And you in my arms
