------ I Say Spinach (And the Hell With It) ------
--- VERSE: ---
We must keep smiling and play the game
While life keeps hurrying on
For there was trouble before we came
'Twill be here after we're gone
So we'll just have to prepare
To snap our fingers at care
--- REFRAIN: ---
Long as there's you, long as there's me
Long as the best things in life are free
I say it's spinach and the hell with it
The hell with it, that's all!
--- Unknown ---
Long as I'm yours, long as your mine
Long as there's love and a moon to shine
I say it's spinach and the hell with it
The hell with it, that's all!
--- Unknown ---
There must be rain to pitter-patter
Things don't come on a silver platter
What does it matter?
--- Unknown ---
Long as there's you, long as there's me
Long as the best things in life are free
I say it's spinach and the hell with it
