------ How Can I Change My Luck? ------
--- VERSE: ---
I've looked 'round for a lucky charm of the popular kind
That would keep me away from harm, they're not easy to find
Four leaf clover and rabbit's feet lucky as they may be
May help others, but I repeat, they have never helped me
--- REFRAIN: ---
The rabbit's foot that I found one day
Was on a rabbit that ran away
Ooh, ooh, what'll I do?
How can I change my luck?
--- Unknown ---
The four leaf clover I stooped to pick
Was poison ivy and made me sick
Ooh, ooh, what'll I do?
How can I change my luck?
--- Unknown ---
I hung a horseshoe right over my bed
Down came the horseshoe on top of my head
--- Unknown ---
The lucky star that I long to see
Is shining somewhere, but not for me
Ooh, ooh, what'll I do?
