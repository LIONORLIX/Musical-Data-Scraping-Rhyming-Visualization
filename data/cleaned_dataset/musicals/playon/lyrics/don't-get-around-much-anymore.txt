------ Don't Get Around Much Anymore ------
--- Unknown ---
Missed the Saturday dance
Heard they crowded the floor
Couldn't bear it without you
Don't get around much anymore
--- Unknown ---
Thought I'd visit the club
Got as far as the door
They'd have asked me about you
Don't get around much anymore
--- Unknown ---
Oh, Darling I guess my mind's more at ease
But nevertheless, why stir up memories
--- Unknown ---
Been invited on dates
Might have gone but what for
Awfully different without you
