------ I Let a Song Go Out of My Heart ------
--- Unknown ---
I let a song go out of my heart
It was the sweetest melody
I know I lost heaven
'Cause you were the song
--- Unknown ---
Since you and I had drifted apart
Life doesn't mean a thing to me
Please come back sweet music
I know I was wrong
--- Unknown ---
Am I too late
To make amends
You know that we were meant to be
More than just friends, just friends
--- Unknown ---
I let a song go out of my heart
Believe me darling when I say
I won't know sweet music
