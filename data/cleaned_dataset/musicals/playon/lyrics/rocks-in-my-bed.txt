------ Rocks in My Bed ------
--- Unknown ---
My heart is heavy as lead
Because the blues has done spread
Rocks in my bed
--- Unknown ---
Of all the people I see
Why do they pick on poor me
And put rocks in my bed
--- Unknown ---
All night long I weep
So how can I sleep
With rocks in my bed
--- Unknown ---
There's only two kinds of people
I can't understand
There's only two kinds of people
I can't understand
That's a deceitful woman
And a hard faced man
--- Unknown ---
She took my man away
And aint goin bring him back
She took my man away
And aint goin bring him back
Shes lower than a snake down in a wagon track
--- Unknown ---

--- Unknown ---
I got rocks in my bed
I got rocks in my bed
Rocks in my bed
I got rocks in my bed
--- Unknown ---
Under-loved, over-fed
My mans gone, so instead
I got rocks in my bed
Under-loved, over-fed
My mans gone, so instead
