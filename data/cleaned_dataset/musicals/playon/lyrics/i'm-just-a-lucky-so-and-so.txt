------ I'm Just a Lucky So and So ------
--- Unknown ---
If you should ask me the amount in my bank account
I'd have to confess that I'm slippin'
But that don't worry me, confidentially
I've got a dream that's a pippin'
--- Unknown ---
And when the day is through
Each night I hurry to
A home where love waits, I know
I guess I'm just a lucky, lucky so and so
--- Unknown ---
As I walk down the street
Sinsing to everyone I meet
Gives me a friendly hello, yeah
I guess I'm just a lucky so, lucky so and so
Lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky
--- Unknown ---
Birds in every tree
Are all so neighborly
They sing wherever I go, sing pretty
I guess I'm just a lucky, woh what a lucky so and so
--- Unknown ---
As if you should ask me the amount in my bank account
I'd have to admit, I'd have to confess that I'm slippin'
But that don't worry me, confidentially
I've got a dream that's a pippin'
--- Unknown ---
Yeah, and when the day, and when the day is through
Each night I hurry to
A home, a home where love waits and I know
I guess, I guess I'm just a lucky, lucky, lucky so and so
So lucky, so and so
