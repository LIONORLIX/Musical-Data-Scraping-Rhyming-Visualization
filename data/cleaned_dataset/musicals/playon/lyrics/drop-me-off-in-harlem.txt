------ Drop Me off in Harlem ------
--- Unknown ---
Drop me off in Harlem,
any place in Harlem,
There's someone waiting there
who makes it seem like
Heaven up in Harlem.
--- Unknown ---
I don't want your Dixie,
you can keep your Dixie,
there's no one down in Dixie who can take me
'way from my hot Harlem,
--- Unknown ---
Harlem has those southern skies,
they're in my baby's smile, I
idolize my baby's eyes and
classy up-town style,
--- Unknown ---
If Harlem moved to China,
I know of nothing finer,
Than to stow away on a 'plane some day and have them
drop me off in Harlem.
