------ Everything But You ------
--- Unknown ---
You left me a horse from Texas,
A house with installments due,
A letter with lots of X-S
Everything but you.
--- Unknown ---
You left me some beans from Boston,
A bicycle built for two,
A memory to get lost in,
Everything but you.
--- Unknown ---
Each day was so gay and so daring,
I loved every breathtaking minute,
for how could I know I was sharing
a kiss without a future in it.
--- Unknown ---
You left me a dream to room with,
A coffee pot from Peru,
A knife and fork to spoon with,
Everything but you.
