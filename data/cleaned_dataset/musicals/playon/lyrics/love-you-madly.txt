------ Love You Madly ------
--- Unknown ---
Love you madly
right or wrong
sounds like a lyric of a song
But since it's so
I thought you oughta know
I love you, love you madly
--- Unknown ---
Better fish are in the sea
Is not the theory for me
And that's for sure
Just like I said before
I love you, love you madly
--- Unknown ---
If you could see the happy you and me
I dream about so proudly
You'd know the breath of spring
That makes me sing
My love song so loudly
--- Unknown ---
Good things come to those who wait
So just relax and wait for fate
To let me see the day you'll say to me
I love you, love you madly
--- Unknown ---
But since it's so
I thought you oughta know
I love you, madly
--- Unknown ---
And that's for sure
Just like I said before
I love you, love you madly
--- Unknown ---
If you could see the happy you and me
I dream about so proudly
You'd know the breath of spring
That makes me sing
My love song so loudly
--- Unknown ---
To let me see the day you'll say to me
I love you madly
