------ Don't You Know I Care ------
--- Unknown ---
Don't you know I care
Or don't you care to know?
If you know I care
How could you hurt me so?
--- Unknown ---
Darling, you are part
Of every breath I take
Will you break my heart
Or give my heart a break?
--- Unknown ---
I can't figure out what love's all about
And where I fit into your scheme
Am I wasting time? Please tell me
'Cause I'm down to my last dream
--- Unknown ---
Won't you please be fair?
Love me or let me go
Don't you know I care
