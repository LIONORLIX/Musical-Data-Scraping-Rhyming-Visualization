------ I Didn't Know About You ------
--- Unknown ---
I ran around, with my own little crowd
The usual laughs, not often, but loud
And in the world that I knew
I didn't know about you
--- Unknown ---
Chasing after the ring, on the merry-go-round
Just taking my fun, where it could be found
And yet what else could I do
I didn't know about you
--- Unknown ---
Darling, now I know
I had the loneliest yesterday, everyday
In your arms
I know for once in my life, I'm living
--- Unknown ---
Had a good time, everytime I went out
Romance was a thing, I kidded about
How could I know about love
I didn't know about you
--- Unknown ---
