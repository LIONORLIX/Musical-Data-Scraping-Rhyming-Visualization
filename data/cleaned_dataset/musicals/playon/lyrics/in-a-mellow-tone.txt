------ In a Mellow Tone ------
--- Unknown ---
In a mellow tone
Feeling fancy free
And I'm not alone
I've got company
--- Unknown ---
Everything's ok
The live long day
With this mellow song
I can't go wrong
--- Unknown ---
In a mellow tone
That's the way to live
If you mope and groan
Something's gotta give
--- Unknown ---
Just go your way
And laugh and play
There's joy unknown
In a mellow tone
--- Unknown ---
(scat)
In a mellow tone
--- Unknown ---
In a mellow tone
Feeling fancy free
And I'm not alone
I've got company
--- Unknown ---
Everything's ok
The live long day
With this mellow song
I can't go wrong
--- Unknown ---
In a mellow tone
That's the way to live
If you mope and groan
Something's gotta give
--- Unknown ---
Just go your way
And laugh and play
There's joy unknown
In a mellow tone
In a mellow tone
