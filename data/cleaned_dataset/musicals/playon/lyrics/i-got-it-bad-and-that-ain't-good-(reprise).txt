------ I Got It Bad and That Ain't Good (Reprise) ------
--- Unknown ---
The poets say that all who love are blind
Well I'm inl ove and I know what time it is
The good books say go seekand ye shall find
Well I have sought and my what a climb it is
My life is just like tha weather it changes with the hour
When he's near I'm fair and warmer
When he is gone I'm cloudy with showers
Any motion loke the ocean
It's either sink or swim
When a woman loves a man like I love him
--- Unknown ---
Never treats me sweet and gentle the way he should
I got it bad and that ain't good
--- Unknown ---
My poor heart is sentimental
Not made of wood
I got it bad and that ain't good
--- Unknown ---
But when the weekend's over
And Monday rolls around
I end up like I start out
Just crying my heart out
--- Unknown ---
He don't love me like I love nobody could
I got it bad and that ain't good
--- Unknown ---
The folks with good intentions
Tell me to save my tears
I'm glad I'm mad about him
I can't live without him
--- Unknown ---
Lord above me,make him love me
The way he should
