------ Prelude to a Kiss ------
--- Unknown ---
If you hear a song in blue
like a flower crying for dew
That was my heart serenading you
MY PRELUDE TO A KISS
If you hear a song that grows
from my tender sentimental woes
That was my heart trying to compose
A PRELUDE TO A KISS
Though it's just a simple melody
with nothing fancy, nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony -
a Schubert tune with a Gershwin touch
Oh! How my love song gently cries
for the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies
A PRELUDE TO A KISS.
