We LOVE you!

Phone rings,
Door chimes,
In comes
Company!
No strings,
Good times,
Just chums,
Company!
Late nights,
Quick bites,
Party games,
Deep talks,
Long walks,
Telephone calls.
Thoughts shared,
Souls bared,
Private names,
All those
Photos
Up on the walls--
With love.
With love filling the days,
With love seventy ways,
To Bobby with love
From all those good and crazy people, your friends!
Those good and crazy people, your married friends!
And that's what it's all about, isn't it?
That's what it's really about, isn't it?
That's what it's really about,
Really about!
--- HUSBANDS ---
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
--- WIVES & GIRLFRIENDS ---
We LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOVE...
--- ROBERT ---
You I love and you I love and you I love and you I love
And you I love and you I love and you I love!
I love you!
--- ALL ---
Company! Company!
Company!
Lots of
Company!
Years of
Company!
Love is
Company!
