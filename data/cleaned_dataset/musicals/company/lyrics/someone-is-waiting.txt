------ Someone Is Waiting ------
--- ROBERT ---
Someone is waiting,
Cool as Sarah,
Easy and loving as Susan...
Jenny...
Someone is waiting,
Warm as Susan,
Frantic and touching as Amy...
Joanne...
Would I know her even if I met her?
Have I missed her? Did I let her go?
A Susan sort of Sarah,
A Jennyish Joanne.
Wait for me, I'm ready now,
I'll find you if I can!
Someone will hold me,
Soft as Jenny,
Skinny and blue-eyed as Amy...
Susan...
Someone will wake me,
Sweet as Amy,
Tender and foolish as Sarah...
Joanne...
Did I know her? Have I waited too long?
Maybe so, but maybe so has she.
My blue-eyed Sarah, warm Joanne,
Sweet Jenny, loving Susan, crazy Amy,
Wait for me!
I'll hurry!
Wait for me!
Hurry!
Wait for me!
Hurry!
