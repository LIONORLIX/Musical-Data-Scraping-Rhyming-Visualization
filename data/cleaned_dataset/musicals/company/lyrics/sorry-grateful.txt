------ Sorry-Grateful ------
--- ROBERT [speaking] ---
Harry, you ever sorry you got married?
--- HARRY ---
You're always sorry,
You're always grateful,
You're always wondering
What might have been--
Then she walks in.
--- Unknown ---
And still you're sorry,
And still you're grateful,
And still you wonder
And still you doubt--
And she goes out.
--- Unknown ---
Everything's different, nothing's changed.
Only maybe slightly rearranged.
--- Unknown ---
You're sorry-grateful,
Regretful-happy.
Why look for answers
When none occur?
You always are what you always were,
Which has nothing to do with, all to do with her.
--- DAVID ---
You're always sorry,
You're always grateful,
You hold her, thinking:
I'm not alone.
You're still alone.
--- Unknown ---
You don't live for her,
You do live with her,
You're scared she's starting
To drift away,
And scared she'll stay.
--- LARRY ---
Good things get better, bad get worse.
Wait, I think I meant that in reverse.
--- HARRY, DAVID, LARRY ---
You're sorry-grateful,
Regretful-happy.
Why look for answers
When none occur?
You'll always be what you always were,
Which has nothing to do with, all to do with her.
