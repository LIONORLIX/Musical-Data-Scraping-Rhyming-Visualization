One is lonely and two is boring,

Side by side by side.

Never a bother!
Seven times a godfather!

Year after year,
Older and older...

Sharing a tear,
Lending a shoulder.

Friendship forbids
Anything bitter.

Here is the church,
Here is the steeple.
Open the doors
And see all the crazy married people.
--- FRIENDS ---
What would we do without you?
How would we ever get through?
Who would I complain to for hours?
Who'd bring me the flowers
When I have the flu?
Who'd finish yesterday's stew?
Who'd take the kids to the zoo?
Who is so dear, and who is so deep,
And who would keep her/him occupied when I want to sleep?
How would we ever get through?
What would we do without you?
--- Unknown ---
What would we do without you?
How would we ever get through?
Should there be a marital squabble,
Available Bob'll
Be there with the glue.
Who could we open up to,
Secrets we keep from guess who?
Who is so safe, and who is so sound?
You never need an analyst with Bobby around!
How would we ever get through?
What would we do without you?
--- Unknown ---
What would we do without you?
How would we ever get through?
Who sends anniversary wishes?
Who helps with the dishes
And never says boo?
Who changes subjects on cue?
Who cheers us up when we're blue?
Who is a flirt, but never a threat,
Reminds us of our birthdays which we always forget?
How would we ever get through?
What would we do without you?
--- Unknown ---
What would we do without you?
How would we ever get--
How would we ever get--
How would we ever get--
How would we ever get--through?
What would we do without you?
--- ROBERT ---
Just what you usually do.
--- FRIENDS ---
Right!
You who sit with us,
You who share with us,
You who fit with us,
You who bear with us,
You-hoo, you-hoo,
You-hoo, you-hoo...
--- Unknown ---
ROBERT: Okay now! Everybody!
--- ALL ---
Isn't it warm?
Isn't it rosy?
Side by side!
Ports in a storm,
Comfy and cozy,
Side by side!
Everything shines,
How sweet,
Side by side!
Parallel lines
Who meet,
Side by side!
Year after year,
Older and older,
Side by side!
Sharing a tear
And lending a shoulder,
Side by side!
One's impossible, two is gloomy,
Give another number to me,
Side by side by side by side
By side by side by side by side
