------ Learning to Be Silent ------
--- Unknown ---
Vi
Swallowing my words
Staring at the floor
Counting little cracks in the tile
Struggling to smile without choking
Learning to be silent
Ethel
Watching how the dust
Dances out the door
Noticing my hands start to shake
Contemplating taking up smoking
Learning to be silent
Vi & Ethel
Always hearing
Ethel
Hush, Ethel!
Vi
Please, Vi!
Vi & Ethel
Let's not have this conversation
Ethel
And so I stand by
While my mind takes a small vacation
Vi & Ethel
La la la la la la la la
Vi
Making little sounds
Other folks ignore
Ethel
Quieting the beat of my heart
Never being part of the moment
Vi & Ethel
Learning to be silent
Vi
Learning there are some topics that we don't even mention
Ethel
And if they come up, then we try to be vague
Vi
There are subjects from which we divert all attention
Ethel
And some we avoid like the plague
Vi & Ethel
I'm
Becoming a mime
Vi
Biting my tongue
Ethel
Biding my time
Vi
Trying not to scream
Ethel
Managed it before
Vi & Ethel
Knowing if I'm going to survive
Then, dammit
Ethel
I've got to practice
Vi
Practice
Vi & Ethel
