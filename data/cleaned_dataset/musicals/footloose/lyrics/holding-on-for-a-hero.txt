------ Holding on for a Hero ------
--- Unknown ---
Ariel
Where have all the good men gone
And where are all the gods?
Rusty, Wendy Jo & Urleen
Yeah?
Ariel
Where's the streetwise Hercules
to fight the rising odds?
--- Unknown ---
Rusty, Wendy Jo & Urleen
I'd like to know
Ariel
Isn't there a white knight upon a firey steed?
Late at night I toss and I turn
Rusty, Wendy Jo & Urleen
I toss and I turn ooooo
Ariel
And I dream of what I need
I need a hero
Rusty, Wendy Jo & Urleen
Doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo ah! Ah!
Ariel
Somewhere after midnight in my wildest fantasy
Somewhere just beyond my reach
There's someone reaching back for me
Rusty, Wendy Jo & Urleen
Hoo hoo hoo hoo
Ariel
Racing on the thunder
And rising with the heat
It's gonna take a Superman
To sweep me off my feet
I need a hero
I'm holding out for a hero til the end of the night
Wendy Jo
He's gotta be strong
Urleen
And he's gotta be fast
Rusty
And he's gotta be fresh from the fight
All
I need a hero
I'm holding out for a hero til the morning night
He's gotta be sure
And it's gotta be soon
And he's gotta be larger than life
Ariel
Larger than life
Rusty, Wendy Jo & Urleen
Doo doo doo doo ah! Ah!
Ariel
Up where the mountains meet the heavens above
Rusty
Out where the lightning splits the sea
All
I could swear there is someone somewhere watching me
Through the wind and the chill and the rain
And the storm and the flood
I can feel his approach like a fire in my blood
Like a fire in my blood
Like a fire in my blood
Like a fire in my blood
Like a fire in my ah! Ah!
I ned a hero
I'm holding out for a hero til the end of the night
He's gotta be strong
And he's gotta be fast
And he's gotta be fresh from the fight
I need a hero
I'm holding out for a hero til the morning night
He's gotta be sure
And it's gotta be soon
And he's gotta be larger than life
Larger than life
Doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo ah! Ah!
