Cop
Oh yeah? What does she get out of it?
Chuck
Everything that she needs
Ariel
Like you'd know
Chuck
Well, she'd like you to think she was born yesterday
With her innocent looks and her little-town way
When she's smiling at me she's got angels in her eyes
But I've seen how she moves and the girl really cooks
She taught me some tricks you can't learn in books
And I'm starting to think she's a devil in disguise
Chuck, Lyle & Travis

She knows what she likes

Lyle & Travis

Chuck, Lyle & Travis

Good God, this girl gets around
Ariel
Yeah, he likes to pretend he's a man among men
But with his hands in his pockets he can't count to ten
Don't worry, baby, your secret's safe with me
And he bores me to tears with his beers and his bikes
But I keep him around cuz when temptation strikes
I got the motor, he's got the key
Chuck, Lyle & Travis
