------ Mama Says (You Can't Back Down) ------
--- Unknown ---
Willard
Everything I ever learned
That gets me through the worst
I learned at my Mama's knee
Now, anytime I'm turned around
I turn to Mama first
And you'd be wise
To memorize
What Mama says to me
Now, Mama ain't been wrong yet. And I'm living proof
Jeter
Take that for what it's worth
Willard
Mama says
Don't use a toaster while standing in the shower
Now who an argue with that?
Mama says
Don't hold your breath for longer than an hour
The woman knows where it's at!
And Mama says it doesn't matter
If you're a king or you're a clown
Once you drive up a mountain
You can't back down
Bickle
You can't back down, Ren!
Willard
Now, Ren, you've not yet had the pleasure of meeting my Mama,
but these boys here have. C'mon and help me out, fellas.
Jeter, Garvin & Bickle
Mama says
Willard
Don't drink hot coffee lying down in bed
Don't even give it a thought
Jeter, Garvin & Bickle
It's a mess
Mama says
Willard
Never eat anything bigger than your head
Is she a whiz or what?
Jeter, Garvin & Bickle
Oh yes!
Willard
And Mama says it doesn't matter
If you're a king or you're a clown
Once you drive up a mountain
You can't back down
Once you drive up a mountain
You can't back down
Mama makes a lot of sense
If you know how to listen
She is clear and concise
Daddy says, I love her, son,
But she's got marbles missin'
But I say, Hey! It's free advice
And what d'you expect at that price?
Jeter, Garvin & Bickle
Mama says
Willard
What you believe in is all you really own
And I believe that she's right
Jeter, Garvin & Bickle
Mama says
Willard
If you've got doubts, well, then, boy, you're not alone
Just means you're ready to fight
And Mama says it doesn't matter
If you're a king or you're a clown
Once you drive up a mountain
You can't back down, down, down, down
You can turn up the heat
Bickle
You can turn up the road
Willard
You can carry a beat
Garvin
You can carry a load
Willard
You can throw a bit
Jeter
You can throw a punch
Willard
You can bring up a child
Ren
You can bring up your lunch!
A one, two, three!
All
And Mama says it doesn't matter
Willard
If you drive a hard bargain or drive around town
All
Once you drive up a mountain
You can't back down
Once you drive up a mountain
You can't back down!
Willard
I thought of one more thing
Mama says
Don't buy a chandelier unless you've got a ceiling
I don't know what that's about
Mama says
Don't chew on tin foil unless you like that feeling
Somehow she figured that out
Willard, Garvin, Bickle & Jeter
And Mama says it doesn't matter
If you're a king or you're a clown
Once you drive up a mountain
Willard
Remember, boy
Everyone's countin' on you
All
Once you drive up a mountain
You can't back down!
Willard
