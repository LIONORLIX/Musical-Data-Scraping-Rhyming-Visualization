------ Footloose (Finale) ------
--- Unknown ---
Ren
I rented my tux
Garvin & Bickle
Bought flowers -
Jeter
Twelve bucks!
Willard
And on my twenty-third try
I finally tied my tie
Ren, Willard, Garvin, Jeter & Bickle
I got this feeling
That time's no longer holding me down
Ariel
Been feeling so strange
My life is about to change
Rusty
I know just how she feels
Urleen, Wendy Jo & Rusty
That's what happens when you're wearing heels
All
Let's hit the ceiling
And then let's tear up this town
Tonight I gotta cut loose
Footloose
Kick off your Sunday shoes
Please! Louise!
Pull me offa me knees
Jack! Get back!
C'mon before we crack
Lose your blues
Everybody cut footloose
I've got this feeling that time ain't holding me down
Rusty, Wendy Jo & Urleen
Time ain't holding me
Willard, Travis & Lyle
Life ain't holding me down
All
Let's hit the ceiling
And then let's tear up this town
Boys
Ooh wee, Marie
Shake it, shake it for me!
Girls
Whoa, Milo
C'mon, c'mon let's go!
All
Cut footloose
Cut footloose, whoa!
First, we've got to turn you around
Then put your feet on the ground
Now take a hold of your soul
Now take a hold of your soul
Aaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhh!
Ah - ah - ah - ah
Everybody cut everybody cut
Everybody cut everybody cut
Ren
Everybody
All
Everybody
Ren
Everybody
All
Everybody
