------ Footloose/On Any Sunday ------
--- Unknown ---
Ren
Been working so hard
I'm punching my card
Eight hours, for what?
Oh, tell me what I got
Chuck, Lyle & Travis
Been working so hard
I'm punching my card
Eight hours, for what?
Oh, tell me what I got
Wendy Jo
Been working too damn hard
I'm punching that same card
Eight hours, I'm bustin' my butt
Oh, tell me what I got
All
I got this feeling that time's just holding me down
Ren & Urleen
I hate this feeling time is holding me down
All
I'll hit the ceiling or else I'll tear up this town
Tonight I gotta cut loose
Footloose
Kick off your Sunday shoes
Please, Louise
Pull me offa my knees
Jack, get back
C'mon before we crack
Lose your blues
Everybody cut footloose
Rusty, Wendy Jo & Urleen
You're playing so cool
Obeying every rule
Dig way down in your heart
You're burning, yearning for some -
All
Somebody to tell you
That life ain't passing you by
Rusty, Wendy Jo & Urleen
Life ain't passing me by
All
I'm trying to tell you
It will if you don't even try
You can fly
Ren
If you'd only cut loose
All
Cut footloose
All
First!
We've got to turn you around
Second!
Then put your feet on the ground
Third!
Now take a hold of your soul
Life keeps holding me down
Everybody cut everybody cut
The scene shifts to Bomont
Choir
On any Sunday here we'll be
Raising our voices in harmony
One day once our trials have ceased
We will be released
Shaw
On any Sunday, Lord I pray
Tell me exactly the words to say
Give me strength and maybe then
I can reach my fellow men
So we all may rise again
Thank you, Lord, Amen.
Welcome to Bomont

Ren
We've only been here two days and already
Chicago seems a million miles away
But we were barely hanging on there
'Specially with my father gone there's
Not too many places we could stay
But maybe Mom could find a job that's steady
And maybe I could stand it for a year
And maybe things won't be so bad
And maybe I won't miss my dad
And maybe we could start a new life here
Parishoners
Ooh, start a new life here
Ren & Ethel
Have I done the right thing?
Picking up my life
Packing up the past
That's always fright'ning
Have I done the right thing?
Parishoners
The right thing!
The right thing!
We strive to do what's right!
The right thing!
The right thing!
Sin is a matter of black and white!
Kids
There's rumors going 'round about the new kid
And everybody's talking til they're blue
Cuz you know how a stranger is -
If he's not dumb he's dangerous -
But either way, at least it's something new
Shaw
Now I invite you to join my wife Vi and our daughter Ariel
in this morning's convocation
Shaw, Vi & Ariel
God is love
Follow him and never roam
He has made the stars above
Just to light your way back home
Shaw
Everybody!

Raising our voices in harmony
Gathering to join the feast
Asking nought but, Lord, at least
We pray that one day once our trials have ceased
