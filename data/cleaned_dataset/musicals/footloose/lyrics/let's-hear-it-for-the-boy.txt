------ Let's Hear It for the Boy ------
--- Unknown ---
Rusty
My baby, he don't talk sweet
He ain't got much to say
But he loves me, loves me, loves me
I know that he loves me anyway
And maybe he don't dress fine
But I don't really mind
Cuz every time he pulls me near
I just wanna cheer
Let's hear it for the boy
Let's give the boy a hand
Let's hear it for my baby
You know you gotta understand
Whoa, maybe he's no Romeo
But he's lovin' one-man show
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Let's hear it for the boy
Rusty, Ariel, Irene and Doreen
My baby may not be rich
He's watching every dime
But he loves me, loves me, loves me
And we always have a real good time
Rusty
And maybe he sings off key
But that's alright by me
Cuz what he does he does so well
Makes me wanna yell
Let's hear it for the boy
Let's give the boy a hand
Let's hear it for my baby
You know you gotta understand
Maybe he's no Romeo
But he's my lovin' one-man show
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Let's hear it for the boy
Maybe he's no Casanova
Still his kisses bowl me ov-ah!
Let's hear it for the boy
Let's give the boy a hand
Let's hear it for my baby
You know you gotta understand
Oh, he don't score at Bowl-A-Rama
Still, you gotta thank his Mama
Whoa, whoa whoa whoa
Let's hear it for the boy
Hear it for my man
