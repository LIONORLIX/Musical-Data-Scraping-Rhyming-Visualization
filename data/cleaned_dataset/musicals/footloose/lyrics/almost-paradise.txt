------ Almost Paradise ------
--- Unknown ---
Ren
I thought that dreams belonged to other men
Cuz each time I got close, they'd fall apart again
Ariel
I feared my heart would beat in secrecy
Both
I faced the nights alone
Oh, how could I have known
That all my life I only needed you?
Whoa, almost paradise
We're knocking on heaven's door
Almost paradise
How could we ask for more?
I swear that I can see forever in your eyes
Paradise
Ariel
I thought that perfect love was hard to find
I'd almost given up
You must've read my mind
Ren
And all those dreams I saved for a rainy day
Both
They're finally coming trye
I'll share them all with you
Cuz now we hold the future in our hands
Whoa, almost paradise
We're knocking on heaven's door
Almost paradise
How could we ask for more?
I swear that I can see forever in your eyes
Paradise
Ren
And in your arms salvation's not so far away
Ariel
It's getting closer
Both
Closer every day
Almost paradise
We're knocking on heaven's door
Almost paradise
How could we ask for more?
I swear that I can see forever in your eyes
Paradise
