------ Klops Lied (Meatball Song) ------
--- Unknown ---
On top of spaghetti,
All covered with cheese,
I lost my poor meatball,
When somebody sneezed.
--- Unknown ---
It rolled off the table,
And on to the floor,
And then my poor meatball,
Rolled out of the door.
--- Unknown ---
It rolled in the garden,
And under a bush,
And then my poor meatball,
Was nothing but mush.
--- Unknown ---
The mush was as tasty
As tasty could be,
And then the next summer,
It grew into a tree.
--- Unknown ---
The tree was all covered,
All covered with moss,
And on it grew meatballs,
And tomato sauce.
--- Unknown ---
So if you eat spaghetti,
All covered with cheese,
Hold on to your meatball,
------ fin ------
