------ Berlin Im Licht ------
--- Unknown ---
And when you go for a walk, the sunlight may be enough, but to light the city of Berlin, the sun is not enough.
This is no little hicktown.
This is one helluva city!
If you want to see everything you can,
You have to use a few watts!
So what then? So what then?
What kind of a city is it then?
--- Unknown ---
Come, turn on the lights so we can see what there is to see!
Come, turn on the lights and don't say another word.
