------ That's Him ------
--- Unknown ---
You know the way you feel when there is autumn in the air
That’s him, that’s him
The way you feel when Antoine has finished with your hair
That’s him, that’s him
You know the way you feel when you smell fresh bread baking
The way you feel when, oh, your aching back stops aching
Wonderful world, wonderful you, that’s him, that’s him, that’s him
--- Unknown ---
Be simple as a breeze that blows in summer
Be natural, not actuary
He’s like a plumber when you need a plumber
Mmm, he’s satisfactory
You know the way you feel at movies when the lights grow dimmer
The way you feel when overnight your hips grow slimmer
Wonderful world, wonderful you
Say, c’est Paris, say New York, sa-voury

In the darkest caves and hallways, I would know him always
‘Cause I would see that he‘s the one for me
How could I pass by him when I’d identify him so easily
Because you know the way you feel about a rhapsody in blue
His eyes are blue. His eyes are brown! His are on the town
The way you feel about a hat created just for you, that’s him, that’s him
He’s Christmas, he’s collar, he’s a coke with cherries
Let’s face it girls – he’s a man - he’s necessary
