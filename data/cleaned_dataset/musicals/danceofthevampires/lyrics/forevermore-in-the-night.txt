------ Forevermore in the Night ------
--- Krolock ---
A good nightmare comes so rarely
While ordinary dreams are so easy to find
A good nightmare comes so rarely
I'll show you yours
If you show me mine…
--- Unknown ---
You can choose to stay
And be a good wife some fine day
But will it ever be enough?
You know it'll never be enough
--- Unknown ---
You can work and pray here
Till you're fat and old and grey
But will it ever be enough?
You know that it'll never be enough
--- Unknown ---
It's not enough to make your yearning go away
It's not enough to light your tired eyes
It's not enough to put some passion in a dreary day
--- Unknown ---
Everything that they told you
Was nothing but lies
Everything that they bought you
Was nothing but bribes
--- Unknown ---
And i know that you want more
All you wanted was a piece of the night
So come along and take your share
Stop your searching everywhere
Cause the answer's here
I invite you to the ball of your life
Of your life…
--- Unknown ---
There's so much more to the night
There's so much more to the night
The beauty of darkness
Miraculous lands
You'll get it all
If you give me your hands
Give me your heart
And your soul will take flight
Forevermore in the night…
--- Unknown ---
This is your chance
This is your time
Break all the chains
And give me your hand
Give me your soul
And your heart will take flight
Forevermore in the night
Forever mine in the night
There's so much more to the night…
