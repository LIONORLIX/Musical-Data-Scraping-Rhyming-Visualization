------ Vampires In Love ------
--- Sarah ---
Hello? Hello mr von krolock? I've lost my way, are you there?
--- Unknown ---
(turn around…)
--- Sarah ---
Every now and then i get a little bit lonely
And i don't know what i miss
--- Unknown ---
(turn around…)
--- Unknown ---
Every now and then i get a little bit anxious
And i wonder what it is i desire
--- Unknown ---
(turn around…)
--- Unknown ---
Every now and then i get a little bit nervous
That the time of waiting will never end
--- Unknown ---
(turn around…)
--- Unknown ---
Every now and then i get a little bit terrified
And drawn by something i can't withstand
--- Unknown ---
(turn around, bright eyes…)
--- Unknown ---
Every now and then, i hear a voice
--- Unknown ---
(turn around, bright eyes…)
--- Unknown ---
Every now and then, i hear…
--- Unknown ---
(turn around…)
--- Unknown ---
Every now and then i get a little bit restless
And i dream of something wild
--- Unknown ---
(turn around…)
--- Unknown ---
Every now and then i get a little helpless
And i'm longing like a child to be loved
--- Unknown ---
(turn around…)
--- Unknown ---
Every now and then i get a little bit curious
What it's like to be a woman and free
--- Unknown ---
(turn around…)
--- Unknown ---
Every now and then i get a little bit terrified
Of all the hazards waiting for me
--- Unknown ---
(turn around, bright eyes…)
--- Unknown ---
Every now and then, i hear a voice
--- Unknown ---
(turn around, bright eyes…)
--- Unknown ---
Every now and then, i hear a voice
--- Unknown ---
Krolock appears atop the staircase. As he descends the candles light.
--- Krolock ---
Turn around, this is the night
Now i need you more than ever
And if you'll only hold me tight
We'll be holding on forever
And we'll only be making it right
Cause we'll never be wrong
Together we can take it to the end of the line
My love is like a shadow on you all of the time
--- Unknown ---
I don't know what to do
And i'm always in the dark
Sarah:
I feel it like a powder keg awaiting the spark
Both:
I really need you tonight
Forever's gonna start tonight
Forever's gonna start tonight
--- Sarah ---
Once upon a time i dreamed of falling in love
Now i'm scared of falling apart
Krolock:
There's nothing you can do
A total eclipse of the heart
--- Unknown ---
(turn around…)
--- Sarah ---
Every now and then i think i'd better run away from you
Before it's too late
--- Unknown ---
(turn around…)
--- Both ---
But every now and then i know i/you must go where i/you lead me/you
You'll/i'll go with you/me through the gates of hell
--- Sarah ---
Every now and then i know there's no one in the universe
As magical and wond'rous as you
--- Both ---
Every now and then i know there's nothing any better
And there's nothing that i just wouldn't do
--- Unknown ---
(turn around, bright eyes…)
--- Sarah ---
Every now and then i hear a voice
--- Unknown ---
(turn around, bright eyes…)
--- Both ---
Now you know i never had a choice
--- Unknown ---
And i need you now tonight
And i need you more than ever
And if you'll only hold me tight
We'll be holding on forever
And we'll only be making it right
Cause we'll never be wrong
Together we can take it to the end of the line
My love is like a shadow on you all of the time
--- Krolock ---
I don't know what to do
And i'm always in the dark
Sarah:
I feel it like a powder keg awaiting the spark
Both:
I really you need you tonight
Forever's gonna start tonight
Forever's gonna start tonight
--- Sarah ---
Once i dreamed of falling in love
Now i'm scared of falling apart
Krolock:
There's nothing you can do
A total eclipse of the heart
Once upon a time, life was simple and bright
Sarah:
Now there's only layers of dark
Both:
There's nothing you can do
A total eclipse of the heart
Krolock:
There's nothing you can do
Sarah:
A total eclipse of the heart
Krolock:
No! No! Tonight, at the ball!
Sarah:
There's nothing i can do
A total eclipse of the heart
