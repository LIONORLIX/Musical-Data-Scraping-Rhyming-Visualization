------ Carpe Noctem ------
--- A mysterious voice ---
Come with me and bless the night
Let the darkness be your salvation
Curse the day escape the light
Break the chains of imagination
--- Unknown ---
Come with me and seize the night
Now's the time for some inspiration
Leave the day and loose the night
No taboo's only new sensations
--- Unknown ---
In the shadows of the castle
A hero's waiting for the call
And all the devils are waking up
And all the angels start to fall
--- Unknown ---
In the shadows of the castle
They're dying for a thrill
They're going out over the edge
They're moving in for the kill
--- Unknown ---
You gotta curse the day
Its nothing but a merciless light
So open up your arms
And get down on your knees
Suck in all the darkness
And your ready now to seize
Seize the night
Seize the night
--- Unknown ---
Bless the night
Before it has a chance to pass
Seize the night
You do what it takes to make it last
--- Unknown ---
Bless the night
Seize the night
Seize the night right now
--- Unknown ---
Let your dreams out of there cages
Every passion and desire
Let your visions be outrageous
Set your fantasies on fire
--- Unknown ---
Everything will be permitted
There will be nothing left to fear
I've got the magic in your body
Your inhibitions disappear
--- Unknown ---
You gotta curse the day
Its nothing but a merciless light
So open up your arms
And get down on your knees
Suck in all the darkness
And your ready now to seize
Seize the night
Seize the night
--- Unknown ---
Bless the night
Before it has a chance to pass
Seize the night
You do what it takes to make it lastâ€¦
