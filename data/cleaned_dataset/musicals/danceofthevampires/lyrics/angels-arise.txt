------ Angels Arise ------
--- Unknown ---
Angels arise
As night must fall
And radiant eyes
Stare down on us all
If the powers that be
Be beyond our call
Then angels arise
As the night must surely fall
And for every pit of darkness
There's a light so pure, divine
And I ask you to protect me
From those gasps and shutters
And those shivers down my spine
There are things that must be magic
There's no explaining why or how
And there's every sign that once upon a time
Is starting right here and now
