------ Dance Of The Vampires (Finale) ------
--- Sarah ---
I've got a dream that a vampire in a castle
Is dying and is dust in the wind
But his vision won't be ended
And it's coming to pass
That a new world is about to begin
--- Unknown ---
I've got a dream that a boy in a castle
Who would die just to save me from sin
So young and beautiful and innocent too
He knew that in the end
'Twas i have saved him
--- Unknown ---
But i don't see any vampires in the cities
I don't hear the unholy choir sing
And if i can't get a vampire i can still get a boy
And a boy will be the next best thing
A bite away from the future
A boy will be the next best thing…
--- Vampires ---
Go break a heart or your heart will be broken
Go betray your friend or else be betrayed
Grab your chance before it's too late
If you're fighting, you must not be afraid
--- Unknown ---
Better to badder, defend or be beaten
Use your elbows or get jostled yourself
Better to eat than to find you've been eaten
No one cares for you so care for yourself
--- Unknown ---
Now our life in the darkness is over
And we're dancing in the rings of the sun
We are sure of our goals
And know what path we must take
We don't live
We don't die
But we are wide awake
We are in motion
And the soon the world will be won
--- Unknown ---
Before you know it's begun
So all of you out there watch out!
Now we're gonna advance, watch out!
We've got the world in our hands — watch out!
You're gonna see the vampires dance
You're gonna see the vampires dance
--- Unknown ---
Let the revels begin
Let the fires be started
We're dancing for the restless and the steely hearted
Let the devils come in
Let the fires be started
We're dancing for the restless and the phoney hearted
--- Unknown ---
Say a prayer in the darkness
For the magic to come
No matter what it seems
Tonight is what it means to be young
Tonight is what it means to be young
Before you know it's gone
--- Unknown ---
We've got a dream that the darkness is over
And we're dancing in the rings of the sun
But it's only a dream but tonight is for real
You'll never know what means
But you know how it feels
--- Unknown ---
We are in motion
And the soon the world will be won
Before you know it's begun
It's all we really got
Tonight
Now we're crying for blood
Tonight
Before you know it's gone
Tonight
--- Unknown ---
Tonight is what it means to be young
Tonight is what it means to be young
--- Unknown ---
Let the revels begin
Let the fires be started
We're dancing for the restless and the steely hearted
Let the devils come in
Let the fires be started
We're dancing for the restless and the phoney hearted
You're gonna see the vampires dance
We've got the world in our hands
--- Unknown ---
Say a prayer in the darkness
For all the magic to come
No matter what it seems
Tonight is what it means to be young
You're gonna see the vampires dance
Tonight is what it means to be young
Before you know it's begun
--- Unknown ---
We drink your blood and then we eat your soul
Nothing's gonna stop us, let the bad times roll
--- Unknown ---
We drink your blood
And then we eat your soul
Nothing's gonna stop us
Let the bad times roll
--- Unknown ---
You're gonna see the vampires dance…
