------ The Ball (Never Be Enough/You Will Live Forever) ------
--- Krolock ---
When you live forever
You gotta feed your hungry heart
But will it ever be enough? Vampires:
You know it'll never be enough
--- Krolock ---
Every time you think it ends
It's just another start
But will it ever be enough?
Vampires:
You know it'll never be enough
--- Unknown ---
It's not enough, you know we're never satisfied
We want the world
We're never gonna die
It's not enough to ever keep us pacified
--- Krolock & vampires ---
Everything that they tell us is nothing but lies
Everything that they sell us is nothing but bribes
--- Krolock ---
But they're in for a surprise
Her blood is ready racing wild and free
Liquid lightning!
Let it run!
It's like a choir that's on fire
In her body
Exultate, exulate it's come
Now the time has come…
--- Vampires ---
You're such a beauty
Fused with fire and ice
You must offer yourself as the queen of the night
It's your choice
--- Unknown ---
You're so exquisite
You'll be free of the past
Your future unbounded
Your kingdom so vast
--- Unknown ---
Will you become our goddess
And be worship at last
--- Unknown ---
Oh what a wonderful bite
Forever's gonna start tonight
Forever's gonna start tonight…
--- Krolock ---
Once upon a time life was simple and bright
Sarah:
Now there's only layers of dark
Krolock & sarah:
There's nothing you can do
A total eclipse of the heart…
