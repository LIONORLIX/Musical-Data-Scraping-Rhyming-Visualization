I think soâ€¦ that was amazing!
--- Unknown ---
All those years of endless boredom
We did nothing, we endured them
--- Unknown ---
Who knew death could be this hot?
--- Unknown ---
Who would of noticed?
It takes away your breath
The answer to the question
Is there sex after death?
--- Unknown ---
Death is such an odd thing
Death is such an odd thing
