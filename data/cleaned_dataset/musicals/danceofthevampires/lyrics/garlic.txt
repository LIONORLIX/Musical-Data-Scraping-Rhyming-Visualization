------ Garlic ------
--- Unknown ---
We live in constant danger
There's evil in the air
Some people pray
Some run away
Go crazy with despair
Bring us one more bowl now
We want more, you've got the goods
And another bottle, right away
You'll forget what's in the woods
We'll forget what's in the woods
--- Unknown ---
Garlic garlic, when times are tough and grave
Garlic garlic, it's a remedy we crave
Transylvania is scary
One cannot be too wary
For with garlic we are saved
With garlic we are saved
--- Unknown ---
The days are disappointing
The nights are even worse
The cows are scared
The sheep are wary
Out lives are simply cursed
We dance as if we're happy
We sing as if we're fine
But the simple fact, is simply that
We've gone and lost our minds
We've gone and lost our minds
Garlic garlic, the secret of staying young
Garlic garlic, that's why we're so well hung
What's strong is getting stronger
What's long is getting longer
With garlic on your tongue
With garlic on your tongue
--- Unknown ---
We've simply lost our minds
We've simply lost our minds
We've simply gone, we've simply gone
And lost our bloody minds!
--- Unknown ---
Garlic garlic, the secret of staying young
Garlic garlic, that's why were so well hung
What's strong is getting stronger
What's long is getting longer
With garlic on your tongue
With garlic on your tongue
--- Unknown ---
Garlic, garlic, it's the nourishment we crave
Garlic garlic, when times are tough and grave
Garlic garlic, it's a remedy we pray
Transylvania is too scary
One can not be too wary
For garlic we'll be saved
From the cradle to the grave
With garlic we'll be saved
