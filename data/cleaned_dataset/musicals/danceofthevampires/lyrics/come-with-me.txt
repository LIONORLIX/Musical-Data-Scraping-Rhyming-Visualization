------ Come With Me ------
--- Krolock ---
Come with me and bless the night
Let the darkness be your salvation
Curse the day, escape the light
Break the chains of imagination
--- Unknown ---
Come with me and you'll know love
We will show you and we will teach you
Take my hand and learn from us
We will touch you and we will reach you
And you will live forever
You will live forevermore
Forevermoreâ€¦
