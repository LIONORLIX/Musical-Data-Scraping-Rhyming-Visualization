------ There's Never Been A Night Like This (A Girl As Beautiful As She) ------
--- Alfred ---
A girl as beautiful as she
I have never seen
A girl as beautiful as she
Sarah:
A boy as beautiful as he
Alfred:
So disarming
Sarah:
Charming
Both:
I have never ever seen
--- Alfred ---
There's never been a night like this
Since my life began
The thing i'd do for just one kiss
I might never understand
--- Both ---
I'm too excited, i can't sleep
I'm awake, yet i dream
My heart's ignited with a deep burning ache
And i dream
A lovely dream
--- Chagal ---
I've never had a night like this
And it makes me sad
Oh magda
A maid as beautiful as she
I have never ever had
--- Magda ---
I've never had a night like this
And it makes me mad
Rebecca:
I used to have some nights like this
Magda:
This emptiness, not happiness
Rebecca:
Now i miss what i once had
Magda:
That's all i've ever had
--- Alfred & sarah ---
I am delighted heaven sent you to start something new
Rebecca & magda:
Nothing is ever sent for me
Alfred & sarah:
Wish i could fight it but i can't for my heart belongs to you
Fantasies come true
--- Alfred & sarah ---
Lord, if i ever fall in love let it be just for me
Lord, if i ever fall in love let it be someone as glorious as she/he
And eternally
I'll wait breathlessly
Let it be
