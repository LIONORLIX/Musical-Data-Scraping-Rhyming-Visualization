------ You Can't Stop The Beat ------
--- TRACY ---
You cant stop an avalanche
As it races down the hill
You can try to stop the seasons, girl
But ya know you never will
And you can try to stop my dancin' feet
--- Unknown ---
But i just cannot stand still
'Cause the world keeps spinning
'Round and 'round
And my heart's keeping time
To the speed of sound
I was lost til i heard the drums
Then i found my way
--- TRACY & LINK ---
'Cause you can't stop the beat
--- Unknown ---
Ever since this old world began
A woman found out if she shook it
She could shake up a man
And so i'm gonna shake and shimmy it
The best that i can today
--- Unknown ---
'Cause you cant stop
The motion of the ocean
Or the sun in the sky
You can wonder if you wanna
But i never ask why
--- Unknown ---
And if you try to hold me down
I'm gonna spit in your eye and say
That you cant stop the beat!

--- TRACY ---
What do ya' have to say, Penny?
--- PENNY ---
I am now a checkerboard chick!
You can't stop a river
As it rushes to the sea
You can try and stop the hands of time
But ya know it just can't be
And if they try to stop us, seaweed,
I'll call the n - double-a - c - p!
'Cause the world keeps spinning
'Round and 'round.
--- SEAWEED ---
'Round and 'round
--- PENNY ---
And my heart's keeping time
To the speed of sound
--- SEAWEED ---
Speed of sound
--- PENNY ---
I was lost till i heard the drums
Then i found my way
--- PENNY & SEAWEED ---
'Cause you can't stop the beat
--- PENNY & SEAWEED, TRACY & LINK ---
Ever since we first saw the light
A man and woman liked to shake it
On a saturday night
And so i'm gonna shake and shimmy it
With all my might today
'Cause you cant stop
The motion of the ocean
Or the rain from above
They can try to stop the paradise
We're dreaming of
But they cannot stop the rhythm
Of two hearts in love to stay
'Cause you cant stop the beat!
--- EDNA ---
Tracy, I have a little something
I'd like to add, if you don't mind.
You cant stop my happiness
'Cause i like the way i am
And you just can't stop my knife and fork
When i see a christmas ham
So if you don't like the way i look
Well, i |ust don't give a damn!
--- EDNA & ENSEMBLE ---
'Cause the world keeps spinning
'Round and 'round
And my heart's keeping time
To the speed of sound
I was lost til i heard the drums
Then i found my way
