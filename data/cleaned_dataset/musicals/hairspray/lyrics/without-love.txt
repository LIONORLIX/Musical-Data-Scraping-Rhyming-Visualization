------ Without Love ------
--- SEAWEED ---
Psst Penny! What happened?!
--- Unknown ---
PENNY (strapped into bed)
My mother's punishing me for going to jail without permission!
--- SEAWEED ---
Well, I'm here to save the fair maiden in her tower.
--- PENNY ---
Oh, Seaweed!
--- Unknown ---
LINK (sneaking into jail)
Tracy, you took beautiful behind bars!
--- TRACY ---
It must be the low-watt institutional lighting!
--- LINK ---
Oh Tracy, they can keep us from kissing,
but they can't stop us from singing!
--- LINK ---
Once i was a selfish fool
Who never understood
I never looked inside myself
Though on the outside, i looked good!
--- Unknown ---
Then we met and you made me
The man i am today
Tracy, i'm in love with you
No matter what you weigh
'Cause...
--- Unknown ---
LINK (& ENSEMBLE)
Without love
Life is like the seasons with
No summer
Without love
Life is rock 'n' roll without
A drummer
--- Unknown ---
Tracy, i'll be yours forever
'Cause I never wanna be
Without love
Tracy, never set me free
No, i ain't lyin'
Never set me free, Tracy,
No, no, no!!
--- TRACY ---
Once i was a simple girl
Then stardom came to me
But i was still a nothing
Though a thousand fans may
Disagree
--- ENSEMBLE ---
Tracy!!
--- TRACY ---
Fame was just a prison
Signing autographs a bore
I didn't have a clue
'Til you came banging on my door
--- Unknown ---
TRACY (& ENSEMBLE)
That without love
Life is like my dad without his bromo
Without love
Life is making out with Perry Como!
--- Unknown ---
Darling, i'll be yours forever
'Cause i never wanna be
Without love
So darling, throw away the key
--- LINK & TRACY ---
I'm yours forever
--- TRACY ---
Throw away the key
--- LINK, TRACY& ENSEMBLE ---
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
--- SEAWEED ---
Living in the ghetto
Black is everywhere ya go
Who'd 've thought i'd love a girl
With skin as white as winter's snow
--- PENNY ---
In my ivory tower
Life was just a Hostess snack
But now i've tasted chocolate
And i'm never going back
--- PENNY & SEAWEED & ENSEMBLE ---
'Cause without love
--- SEAWEED ---
Life is like a beat that you can't follow
--- PENNY & SEAWEED & ENSEMBLE ---
Without love
--- PENNY ---
Life is Doris Day at the apollo
--- PENNY & SEAWEED & ENSEMBLE ---
Darling, i'll be yours forever
'Cause i never wanna be
Without love
--- SEAWEED ---
So darling, never set me free
--- PENNY & SEAWEED ---
I'm yours forever
Never set me free
--- PENNY & SEAWEED & ENSEMBLE ---
No, no, no!
--- LINK ---
If you're locked up in this prison, trace
I don't know what i'll do
--- TRACY ---
Link, i've got to break out
So that i can get my hands on you
--- SEAWEED ---
And girl, if i can't touch you
Now i'm gonna lose control
--- PENNY ---
Seaweed, you're my black white knight
I've found my blue-eyed soul
--- SEAWEED & ENSEMBLE ---
Sweet freedom is our goal!
--- LINK ---
Trace, i wanna kiss ya!
--- TRACY ---
Then i can't wait for parole!
--- Unknown ---
(Link & Seaweed break their girls out of their respective prisons
and continue singing... of course)
--- ALL ---
'Cause without love
--- SEAWEED ---
Life is like a prom that won't invite us
--- ALL ---
Without love
--- LINK ---
Life's getting my big break and laryngitis
--- ALL ---
Without love
--- PENNY ---
Life's a '45' when you can't buy it
--- ALL ---
Without love
--- TRACY ---
Life is like my mother on a diet
--- ALL ---
Like a week that's only mondays
Only ice cream never sundaes
Like a circle with no center
Like a door marked do not enter!
--- Unknown ---
DARLING, I'LL BE YOURS FOREVER
'Cause I never wanna be...
--- Unknown ---
Without love
--- PENNY & LINK ---
Ys now you've captured me
--- ENSEMBLE ---
Without love
--- SEAWEED & TRACY ---
I surrender happily
--- ENSEMBLE ---
Without love
--- PENNY ---
Oh seaweed
--- ALL ---
Never set me free
--- PENNY & SEAWEED ---
No, no, no
--- TRACY & LINK ---
No, i ain't lyin'
--- PENNY & SEAWEED ---
Never set me free
--- ALL ---
No, no, no
No, i dont wanna live without
--- PENNY ---
Love, love, love
--- LINK ---
Yeah, yeah, yeah
--- ALL ---
Darling, you had best believe me,
