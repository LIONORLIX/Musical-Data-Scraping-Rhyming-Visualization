------ Good Morning Baltimore Reprise ------
--- TRACY ---
Oh, oh, oh
I'm all alone
My heart has grown
But it's broken, too
--- Unknown ---
This morning
Life was a Baltimore fairy tale
Now i can't make bail!
--- Unknown ---
My mother's in shock
My father's in hock
I much prefer link's arms
To jailhouse cells
--- Unknown ---
So link, please rescue me now
'Cause i love you
And this prison smells.
Link, hear the bells!
--- Unknown ---
And get ready, Baltimore
There's a bright, brand-new
Day in store
Let me out so this dream's
Unfurled
I'll eat some breakfast,
Then change the world!
And i promise Baltimore
Once i cha-cha right out of
That door
The world's gonna wake up
And see
------ fin ------
