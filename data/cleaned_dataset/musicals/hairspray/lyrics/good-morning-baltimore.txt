------ Good Morning Baltimore ------
--- TRACY ---
Oh, oh, oh
Woke up today
Feeling the way i always do
Oh, oh, oh
Hungry for something
That i can't eat
Then i hear that beat
The rhythm of town
Starts calling me down
It's like a message from
High above
Oh, oh, oh
Pulling me out
To the smiles and the
Streets that i love
--- Unknown ---
TRACY (& ENSEMBLE)
Good morning Baltimore
Every day's like an open door
Every night is a fantasy
Every sound's like a symphony
--- Unknown ---
Good morning Baltimore
And some day when i take to the floor
The world's gonna wake up and see
Baltimore and me
--- Unknown ---
Oh, oh, oh
Look at my hair
What do can compare with mine today?
Oh, oh, oh,
I've got my hairspray and radio
I'm ready to go
--- Unknown ---
The rats on the street
All dance round my feet
They seem to say
Tracy, it's up to you
So, oh, oh
Don't hold me back
'Cause today all my dreams will come true
--- Unknown ---
Good morning Baltimore
There's the flasher who lives next door
There's the bum on his bar room stool
They wish me luck on my way to school
--- Unknown ---
Good morning Baltimore
And some day when i take to the floor
The world's gonna wake up and see
Baltimore and me
--- Unknown ---
I know every step
I know every song
I know there's a place where i belong
I see all those party lights shining ahead
So someone invite me
Before i drop dead!
--- ENSEMBLE ---
Before she drops dead!
--- Unknown ---
TRACY (& ENSEMBLE)
So, Oh, Oh
--- Unknown ---
Give me a chance
'Cause when i start to dance i'm a movie star
Oh, oh, oh
Something inside of me makes me move
When i hear the groove
--- Unknown ---
My ma tells me no
But my feet tell me go!
It's like a drummer inside my heart
Oh, oh, oh
Don't make me wait
One more moment for my life to start...
--- ENSEMBLE ---
Good morning, good morning
Waiting for my life to start
--- Unknown ---
TRACY (& ENSEMBLE)
I love you Baltimore
Every day's like an open door
Every night is a fantasy
Every sound's like a symphony
--- Unknown ---
And i promise Baltimore
That some day when
I take to the floor
The world's gonna wake up and see
Gonna wake up and see
Baltimore and me...
--- ENSEMBLE ---
Yes, More Or Less We All Agree
--- TRACY ---
Baltimore and me...
--- ENSEMBLE ---
Someday the world
Is gonna see
--- TRACY ---
