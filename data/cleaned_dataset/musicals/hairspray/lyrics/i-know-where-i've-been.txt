------ I Know Where I've Been ------
--- MOTORMOUTH ---
There's a light
In the darkness
Though the night
Is black as my skin
There's a light
Burning bright
Showing me the way
But i know where i've been
--- Unknown ---
There's a cry
In the distance
It's a voice
That comes from deep within
There's a cry
Asking why
I pray the answer's up ahead
'Cause i know where i've been
--- Unknown ---
There's a road
We've been travelin'
Lost so many on the way
But the riches
Will be plenty
Worth the price we
Had to pay
--- Unknown ---
There's a dream
In the future
There's a struggle
We have yet to win
And there's pride
In my heart
'Cause i know
Where i'm going
And i know where i've been
--- MOTORMOUTH & ENSEMBLE ---
There's a road
We must travel
There's a promise
We must make
'Cause the riches
Will be plenty
Worth the risk
And chances that we take
There's a dream
In the future
There's a struggle
--- Unknown ---
We have yet to win
Use that pride
In our hearts
To lift us up
To tomorrow
--- Unknown ---
'Cause just to sit still
Would be a sin
--- ENSEMBLE ---
I know it, i know it
I know where i'm going
--- MOTORMOUTH ---
And lord knows i know..
Where i've been
--- MOTORMOUTH & ENSEMBLE ---
Oh! When we win,
I'll give thanks to my god
