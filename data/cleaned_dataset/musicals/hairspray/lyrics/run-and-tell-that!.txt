------ Run And Tell That! ------
--- SEAWEED ---
Hey Tracy, my mom is hosting a platter party up on North Avenue. Wanna check it out?
--- PENNY ---
May i also check it out?
--- SEAWEED ---
Oh, you surely may!
--- TRACY ---
I've never been to North Avenue!
--- LINK ---
Ya think it'll be all right for, you know... us?
--- SEAWEED ---
It's cool, cracker boy!
--- PENNY ---
Being invited places by colored people!
--- TRACY ---
It feels so hip!
--- SEAWEED ---
I'm glad you feel that way, friends, 'cause not everybody does.
--- Unknown ---
I can't see
Why people look at me
And only see the color of my face
--- Unknown ---
And then there's those
That try to help, god knows
But have to always put me in my place
--- Unknown ---
Now i won't ask you to be color blind
'Cause if you pick the fruit
Then girl, you're sure to find...
--- Unknown ---
The blacker the berry
The sweeter the juice
I could say it ain't so
But darlin', what's the use?
--- Unknown ---
The darker the chocolate
The richer the taste
And that's where it's at...
...now run and tell that!!
--- ENSEMBLE ---
Run and tell that!
--- SEAWEED ---
Run and tell that!
--- ENSEMBLE ---
Run and tell that!
--- Unknown ---
SEAWEED (& ENSEMBLE)
I can't see
Why people disagree
Each time i tell them what i know is true
--- Unknown ---
And if you come
And see the world i'm from
1 bet your heart is gonna feel it too
--- Unknown ---
Yeah. I could lie
But baby. Let's be bold
Vanillajian be nice
But if the truth be told...
--- Unknown ---
The blacker the berry
The sweeter the juice
I could say it ain't so
But darlin', what's the use
--- Unknown ---
The darker the chocolate
The richer the taste
That's where it's at
--- Unknown ---
Now run and tell that!!
--- ENSEMBLE ---
Run and tell that!
--- Unknown ---
(The scene shifts to Motormouth Maybelle's record shop dance party where her daughter Li'l Inez and her friends are already in full swing.)
--- Unknown ---
LI'L INEZ
Hey, you're Tracy Turnblad! You're my favorite dancer on the Corny Collins Show.
--- SEAWEED ---
This is my sister, Li'l Inez.
--- TRACY ---
Sure. I saw you at the auditions.
--- Unknown ---
LI'L INEZ
Well, you're the only one who
did, 'cause they kicked me out
on my young, gifted and black
behind.
--- SEAWEED ---
Tell 'em about it!
--- Unknown ---
LI'L INEZ
I'm tired of coverin' up all my pride
--- SEAWEED & ENSEMBLE ---
So give me five on the black-hand side
--- Unknown ---
LI'L INEZ
I've got a new way of movin'
And i got my own voice
--- SEAWEED & ENSEMBLE ---
So how can i help
But to shout and rejoice
--- Unknown ---
LI'L INEZ
The people 'round here
Can barely pay their rent
They're try'n to make dollar
Out 'a fifteen cent
But we got a spirit
Money just cant buy
--- Unknown ---
LI'L INEZ & ENSEMBLE
It's deep as a river
And soars to the sky!!
--- SEAWEED & ENSEMBLE ---
I cant see
The reason it cant be
The kinda world where we all get our chance
--- Unknown ---
The time is now
And we can show them how
To turn the music up and let's all dance
--- Unknown ---
'Cause all things are equal
When it comes to love
Well, that ain't quite true
'Cause when push comes to shove...
--- Unknown ---
The blacker the berry
The sweeter the juice
I could say it ain't so
--- Unknown ---
But darlin', what's the use
The darker the chocolate
The richer the taste
That's where it's at
--- SEAWEED ---
...Now run and tell that!!
--- ENSEMBLE ---
Run and tell that!
