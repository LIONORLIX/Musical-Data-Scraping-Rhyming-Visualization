------ Take That Look Off Your Face ------
--- Unknown ---
You must be mistaken
It couldn't have been
You couldn't have seen him yesterday
He's doing some deal up in Baltimore now
I hate it when he's away
--- Unknown ---
You must be mistaken
I'm sure that you are
There's more than one car with stickers on
And lots of young guys wear corduroy pants
And I'd know if he hadn't gone
--- Unknown ---
Take that look off your face
I can see through your smile
You would love to be right
I bet you didn't sleep good last night
Couldn't wait to bring all of that bad news to my door
Well, I've got news for you
I knew before
--- Unknown ---
If I'm not mistaken, it started last year
I'm not very clear how it began
I noticed a change but I just closed my eyes
As only a woman can
--- Unknown ---
No, I didn't dig deep
I did not want to know
Well, you don't interfere
When you're scared of the things you might hear
When he's back, you think I will end it right there and then?
Well, my fair weather friend, you're wrong again
--- Unknown ---
Take that look off your face
I can see through your smile
You would love to be right
I bet you didn't sleep good last night
Couldn't wait to bring all of that bad news to my door
Well, I've got news for you
I knew before
--- Unknown ---
Take that look off your face
I can see through your smile
You would love to be right
I bet you didn't sleep good last night
Couldn't wait to bring all of that bad news to my door
Well, I've got news for you
