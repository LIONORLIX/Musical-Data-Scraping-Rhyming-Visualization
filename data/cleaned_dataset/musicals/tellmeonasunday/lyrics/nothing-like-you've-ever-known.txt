------ Nothing Like You've Ever Known ------
--- Unknown ---
Nothing like you've ever known
That's the life I thought that I was gonna show you
Made you choose her love or mine
That's one 'happy ever after' that I owe you
--- Unknown ---
Married man... always looking at your watch
I wanted to spend more time than twelve till two
Loving you... and...
--- Unknown ---
Nothing like we've ever dreamed
I'd have sworn that was the life we would be living
We were both expecting more
And we can't give any more than we are giving
--- Unknown ---
Something new... that is all it was, you know
It would have been better if we stayed as we
Used to be... but
--- Unknown ---
Nothing like you've ever known
That is how I thought all your tomorrows would be
Everyday I look at you
