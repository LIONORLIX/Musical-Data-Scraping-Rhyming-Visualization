------ Let Me Finish ------
--- Unknown ---
Just what time of night do you call this?
No I'm not alright... I have had enough... Don't you interrupt
Let me finish I said let me finish
I'm tired of waiting for something to happen
Sorry... I can't live like this any longer
I am not a saint... I've said this before but you haven't heard
Let me finish... this time let me finish
Wait a minute! You'll get your turn
It's not often I get the chance to talk
I forget the last time I saw a person
Fifth Avenue might as well be Mars!
Never thought I would ever say
Keep Manhattan... give me Muswell Hill
I'd have had more fun with Neville Braitwaite
That old devil Neville always put me first (on occasions)
No I don't want a drink!
Not yet
I've rehearsed these next lines for ages
Why do I feel cold? I suppose it's nerves... I don't need a drink
Let me finish... I said let me finish
I've had it to here with your business problems
I don't want to dance with your boss once a year
I don't care if the neighbours hear
You always say we British are too reserved
I need a change I must do something new or I will go mad
Not now! Let me finish... you'll get your chance to call me a child
We've got to make decisions... don't touch me get away
Don't you touch me!
This isn't a joke for God's sake stop smiling
Don't run out we won't solve anything that way
