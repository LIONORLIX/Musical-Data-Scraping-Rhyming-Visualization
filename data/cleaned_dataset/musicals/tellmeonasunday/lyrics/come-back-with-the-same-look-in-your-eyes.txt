------ Come Back With The Same Look In Your Eyes ------
--- Unknown ---
I will see you in a week or two
It's late
You better get going
Take care of yourself and call anytime you feel that you're missing me
I can only say what I always say at these goodbyes
Come back with the same look in your eyes
--- Unknown ---
I know you have your work to do
And I know how much you love me
But sometimes a friendly face can look good to you on a lonely night
If there comes a time just remember I'm the kind that cries
Come back with the same look in your eyes

We would be fools to let love slip away
Everything's so right I'm scared that we might lose it one day
We could never keep things from one another
You know all the feelings that are in my heart
It's not easy... it's not easy
When you have to be apart
--- Unknown ---
So I'll see you in a week or two
It's late
You better get going
You'd think that by now we'd know how to handle this but we never will
When you are away every day I pray that nothing dies... and you'll
