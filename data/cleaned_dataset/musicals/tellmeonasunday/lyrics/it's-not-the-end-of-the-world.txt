------ It's Not the End of the World ------
--- Unknown ---
It's not the end of the world if I lose him
It just might seem so tonight
It's not the end of the world
Nothing like it
I'll soon be the same old me
--- Unknown ---
People get over worse things
And I'll get over this
In no time at all you can bet I'll be laughing
Well I wouldn't give him the pleasure of seeing me cry
Why should I?
--- Unknown ---
It's not the end of the world to feel lonely
I suppose this feeling goes
It's not the end of the world to change rainbows
I'll be fine when I find mine
It's not the end of the world to be free
