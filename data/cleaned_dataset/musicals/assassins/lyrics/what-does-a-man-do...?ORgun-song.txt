------ What Does a Man Do...?/Gun Song ------
--- CZOLGOSZ ---
It takes a lot of men to make a gun,
Hundreds,
Many men to make a gun:
--- Unknown ---
Men in the mines
To dig the iron
Men in the mills
To forge the steel,
Men at machines
To turn the barrel,
Mold the trigger,
Shape the wheel-
It takes a lot of men to make a gun...
One gun...
--- BOOTH ---
And all you have to do
Is move you little finger,
Move your little finger and-
You can change the world.
--- Unknown ---
Why should you be blue
When you've you little finger?
Prove how just a little finger
Can change the world.
--- CZOLGOSZ ---
I hate this gun...
--- GUITEAU ---
What a wonder is a gun!
What a versatile invention!
First of all, when you've a gun-
Everybody pays attention.
--- Unknown ---
When you think what must be done,
Think of all that it can do:
Remove a scoundrel,
Unite a party,
Preserve the Union,
Promote the sales of my book,
Insure my future,
My niche in history,
And then the world will see
That I am not a man to overlook!
Ha-ha!
--- GUITEAU,BOOTH,CZOLGOSZ ---
And all you have to do
Is squeeze your little finger.
Ease your little finger back-
You can change the world.
--- Unknown ---
Whatever else is true,
You trust your little finger.
Just a single little finger
Can change the world.
--- MOORE ---
I got this really great gun-
Shit, where is it?
No, it's really great-
Wait-
--- Unknown ---
Shit, where is it?
Anyway
It's just a .38-
But-
It's a gun.
You can make a statement-
Wrong-
With a gun-
Even if you fail.
--- Unknown ---
It tells 'em who you are
Where you stand.
This one was on sale.
It- no not the shoe-
Well, actually the shoe was, too.
--- Unknown ---
No, that's not it-
Shit, I had it here-
Got it!
--- Unknown ---
Yeah! There it is! And-
--- ALL ---
All you have to do
Is crook your little finger,
Hook your little finger 'round-
--- MOORE ---
Shit, I shot it...
--- OTHERS ---
- You can change the world.
--- QUARTET ---
Simply follow through,
And look, your little finger
Can
Slow them down
To a crawl,
Show them all,
Big and small,
It took a little finger
No time
To change the world.
--- CZOLGOSZ ---
A gun kills many men before it's done,
Hundreds,
Long before you shoot the gun:
Men in the mines
And in the steel mills,
Men at machines,
Who died for what?
--- Unknown ---
Something to buy-
A watch, a shoe, a gun,
A thing to make the bosses richer,
But a gun claims many men before it's done...
Just
One
More..
