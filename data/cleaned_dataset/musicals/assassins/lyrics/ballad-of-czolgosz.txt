------ Ballad of Czolgosz ------
--- BALLADEER ---
Czolgosz,
Working man,
Born in the middle of Michigan,
Woke with a thought
And away he ran
To the Pan-American Exposition
In Buffalo,
In Buffalo.
--- Unknown ---
Saw of a sudden
How things were run,
Said, Time's a-wasting
It's nineteen-one.
Some men have everything
And some have none,
So rise and shine-
In the U.S.A.
You can work your way
To the head of the line!
--- ATTENDANT ---
Single line, ladies and gentlemen. Line forms here
to meet the President of the United States. Single
line to shake hands with President William McKinley.
--- BALLADEER ---
Czolgosz,
Quiet man,
Worked out a quiet
And simple plan,
Strolled of a morning
All spick and span,
To the Temple Of Music
By the Tower Of Light
At the Pan-American Exposition
In Buffalo,
In Buffalo.
--- Unknown ---
Saw Bill McKinley there
In the sun.
Heard Bill McKinley say,
Folks, have fun!
Some men have everything
And some have none,
But that's just fine:
in the U.S.A.
You can work your way
To the head of the line!
--- CROWD ---
Big Bill-!
--- BALLADEER ---
-Gave 'em a thrill.
--- CROWD ---
Big Bill-!
--- BALLADEER ---
-Sold 'em a bill.
--- CROWD ---
Big Bill-!
--- BALLADEER ---
-Who'd want to kill
A man of good will
Like-?
--- CROWD ---
Big Bill!
--- FAIRGOER #1 ---
Doesn't the President look Marvelous?
So round and prosperous!
--- FAIRGOER #2 ---
Do you know what his favorite dish is?
It was in the paer. Beef.
--- FAIRGOER #3 ---
I'm told that in his spare time he enjoys
collecting coins!
--- BALLADEER ---
Czolgosz,
Angry man,
Said, I will do what
A poor man can.
Yes, and there's nowhere
More fitting than
In the Temple Of Music
By the Tower Of Light
Between the Fountain Of Abundance
And the Court of Lilies
At the great Pan-American Exposition
In Buffalo,
In Buffalo.
--- Unknown ---
Wrapped him a handkerchief
round his gun,
Said, Nothin' wrong about
What I done.
Some men have everything
And some have none-
That's by design.
The idea wasn't mine alone,
But mine,
And that's the sign:
--- Unknown ---
In the U.S.A.
You can have your say,
You can set you goals
And seize the day,
You've been given the freedom
To work your way
To the head of the line-
