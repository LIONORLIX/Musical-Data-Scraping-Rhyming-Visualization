------ Lie To Me ------
--- PEPA ---
Open your heart, my dear, and lie to me.
Make me believe that love's a lie.
Tell me we're young again, and songs will be sung again,
and try to see, I need you to lie to me.
Lie to me.
--- IVAN ---
Speak to me softly when you lie to me.
Give me a reason to survive.
Tell me you're mine again, and make the stars shine again.
Bring back the laughter of youth.
Now is no time for tears or the truth.
--- PEPA ---
I don't want to know what is real,
what's solid as steel.
Realities haunt me.
--- IVAN ---
I'd give up my sanity for
just five minutes more
of thinking you want me.
--- PEPA ---
Tell me you're waiting back at home for me.
Say you'll be there when I arrive.
Present and warm for me, the eye of the storm for me.
Give me more of your words -
give me more of your voice -
your voice.
--- Unknown ---
PEPA: Cover my eyes and show me (gravity?)
IVAN: (overlapping) My love, I'll be there for you.
PEPA: All the (?) and the nonsense you contrive.
IVAN: (overlapping) I'll never go, I'll always be here.
Confound and confuse me, darling.
PEPA: Abandon, abuse me, darling.
Lie to me, until it's true.
