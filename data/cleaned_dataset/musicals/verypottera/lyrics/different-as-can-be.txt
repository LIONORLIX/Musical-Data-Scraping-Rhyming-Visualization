------ Different As Can Be ------
--- Quirrell ---
You won't sleep on your tummy
--- Voldemort ---
You won't sleep on your back
--- Voldemort & quirrell ---
We're quite a kooky couple you'll agree
--- Quirrell ---
We share some hands and fingers
--- Voldemort ---
And yet the feeling lingers
--- Voldemort & quirrell ---
We're just about as different as anyone could be
--- Voldemort ---
You like plotting a garden and i like plotting to kill
--- Quirrell ---
You think that you should rule the world, i think books are a thrill!
Sipping tea by the fires swell
--- Voldemort ---
Pushing people in is fun as well
I like folding all my ties
--- Quirrell ---
And you have no friends, hey thats a surprise
--- Voldemort & quirrell ---
I guess its plain to see
When you look at you and me
Were different
Different
As can be
--- Voldemort ---
Youre a sissy, a twat a girl! Im the darkest of lords!
--- Quirrell ---
Im the brightest professor here, ive won several awards
--- Voldemort ---
My new world is about to unfold
--- Quirrell ---
You got beat by a two year old
--- Voldemort ---
Ill kill him this time through and through
--- Quirrell ---
Or you might just give him another tattoo
--- Voldemort & quirrell ---
You really must agree
When you look at you and me
Were different
Different
As can-
--- Voldemort ---
Ill rise again and ill rule the world
But you must help me renew
For when our plan succeeds
--- Quirrell ---
Prevails!
--- Voldemort ---
Part of that world goes to you
--- Quirrell ---
When i rule the world ill plant flowers
--- Voldemort ---
When i rule the world ill have snakes
And goblins, and werewolves, and giants, and thestrals,
A fleet of dementors, and all my death eaters!
--- Voldemort & quirrell ---
When i rule the world!! Hahahaha
