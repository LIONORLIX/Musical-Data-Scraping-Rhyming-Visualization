------ Hey Dragon / The Dragon Song ------
--- Harry ---
Uh... Uh... Accio guitar!
--- Unknown ---
Hey dragon
You don't gotta do this
Let's reevaluate our options
Throw away our old presumptions
Cause really, you don't wanna go through this.
--- Unknown ---
I'm really not that special
The boy who lived is only flesh and bone
--- Dragon (cho chang, draco, cedric) ---
Awwww
--- Harry ---
The truth is in the end, i'm pretty useless without friends.
In fact, i'm alone.
Just like now
Anyhow
--- Unknown ---
I spend my time at school, trying to be this cool guy
I never even asked for it
Don't know any spells, i still manage to do well because there's only so long i can last for.
--- Unknown ---
I'm living off the glory of a stupid children's story
That i had nothing to do with
Just sat there and got lucky
So level with me buddy?
I can't defeat me...
So please don't eat me.
--- Unknown ---
All i can do
Is sing this song for you
La la la la la
--- Dragon ---
Ra ra ra ra ra
--- Harry ---
La la la la la
--- Unknown ---
(repeat both 2x)
--- Unknown ---
That's right, dragon!
You never asked to be a dragon?
I never asked to be a champion!
--- Dragon ---
Yeah!
--- Harry ---
We just jumped on the bandwagon
But all be need is guitar jamming.
--- Unknown ---
So la la la la la
--- Dragon ---
Ra ra ra ra ra
--- Harry ---
La la la la la
--- Dragon ---
Ahhhhhhh... Hm...
--- Harry ---
Goodnight dragon.
--- Unknown ---
Dragon: ahhhh...
--- Harry ---
I beat the dragon!
