------ Granger Danger ------
--- Ron ---
Here i am face to face
With a situation i never thought i'd ever see, it's strange
How a dress can take a mess
And make her nothing less than
Beautiful to me
--- Unknown ---
Feels like my eyes have been transfigured,
Something deep inside has changed
They've been open wide but hold that trigger
--- Unknown ---
This could mean danger!
--- Unknown ---
I'm falling in love, falling in love, falling in love,
I think i'm falling in love, falling in love, falling in love,
With hermione granger
--- Draco ---
What, what the hell is this?
You expect me to sing about her,
Don't care about her.
It's just a little makeup-
Draco wake, i'm mistaken
She is the hottest girl i've ever seen
Now, because she's like a girl i've never seen
Don't know why i'd ever be so mean
This could mean danger!
--- Unknown ---
I'm falling in love, falling in love, falling in love,
I could be falling in love, falling in love, falling in love,
With hermione granger.
--- Both ---
I wanna let her know
--- Draco ---
I feel so queasy
--- Both ---
But i can't let it show
--- Ron ---
She laugh, poor weasley
C'mon, ron
--- Draco ---
Draco
--- Both ---
You gotta let it go,
You gotta let it go!
--- Ron ---
Here i am face to face
With a situation i never thought i'd ever see, it's strange

They've been opened wide but hold that trigger
--- Both ---
This could mean danger!
--- Unknown ---
I'm falling in love, falling in love, falling in love,
I think i'm falling in love, falling in love, falling in love,
With hermione granger,
With hermione granger,
With hermione granger-
Danger!
