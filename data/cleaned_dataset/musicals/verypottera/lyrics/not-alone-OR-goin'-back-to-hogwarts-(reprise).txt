------ Not Alone / Goin' Back to Hogwarts (Reprise) ------
--- All ---
Baby youre not alone
Cause youre here with me
And nothings ever gonna bring us down
Cause nothing can keep me from lovin you
And you know its true
It dont matter whatll come to be
Our love is all we need to make it through
--- All ---
Back to wizards and witches, and magical beasts
To goblins and ghosts and to magical feasts
It's all that i love, and all that i need.
At hogwarts, hogwarts,

Back to spells and enchantments, potions and friends
To gryffindors!
