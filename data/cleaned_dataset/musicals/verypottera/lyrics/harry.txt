--- Ginny ---
The way his hair falls in his eyes
Makes me wonder if hell
Ever see through my disguise
And im under his spell
--- Unknown ---
Everything is falling and i dont know where to land
Everyone knows who he is but they dont know who i am
--- Unknown ---
Harry, harry,
Why cant you see
What youre doing to me
--- Unknown ---
Ive seen you conquer certain death
And even when youre just standing there you take away my breath
And maybe someday youll hear my song
And understand that all along
Theres something more that im trying to say
When i say
--- Unknown ---
Harry, harry, harry
Why cant you see
What youre doing to me
