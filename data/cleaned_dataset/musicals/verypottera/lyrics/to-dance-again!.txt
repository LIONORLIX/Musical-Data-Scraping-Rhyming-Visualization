------ To Dance Again! ------
--- Voldemort ---
When i was a boy
An orphan boy
I loved to move my feet
I’d hear a tune
And start to grove
My life would seem complete
--- Unknown ---
The other boys would laugh and jeer
But i’d catch them tapping their toes
And when id start to sway
They’d get carried away
And oh, how the feeling, grows
--- Unknown ---
I’d take my foot
My little foot
And with that foot
Oh how i’d start to shake!
--- Unknown ---
I’d take two feet
Two tiny feet
Hey look, that’s neat!
It’s coming true!
I finally get to dance again,
Wahoo!
--- Unknown ---
To dance again,
I’ve been waiting all these years to
Dance again
And all at once a chance appears to
Hear the beat, so on your feet
It’s time to dance again!
--- Unknown ---
Come on potter, cruccio!
You take your foot
Your little foot
Hey look, your foot!
See how its starts to shake!
--- Quirrell ---
Oh try his arms
How bout a twirl’
He’s like a girl!
How overdue!
I finally get a chance to dance again with you!
--- Voldemort and quirrell ---
To dance again
I’ve been waiting all these years to dance again
Now all at once a chance appears
It’s lovely swaying and the music’s playing
So come on, let’s dance again
--- Voldemort ---
Everybody!
--- Death eaters ---
I take my foot
--- Voldemort ---
You take that foot
--- Death eaters ---
My little foot
--- Voldemort ---
Take that little foot
--- Death eaters ---
And oh my foot
--- Voldemort ---
Lemme hear it now
--- Death eaters ---
Look how it starts to shake!
Oh voldy's back
--- Voldemort ---
Hello world!
--- Death eaters ---
For the attack!
--- Voldemort ---

--- Death eaters ---
He’ll take over the world its true
But first there’s something he's got to do
--- Unknown ---
All
He'll dance again
He’s been waiting all these years
To dance again
Now all at once a chance appears!
--- Voldemort ---
Everybody make way
For a pas de bourre
--- All ---

Again!
