------ Twin Soliloquies ------
--- Nellie ---
Wonder how I'd feel
Livin' on a hillside,
Lookin' on an ocean,
Beautiful and still.
--- Emile ---
This is what I need,
This is what I've longed for.
Someone young and smilin'
Climbin' up my hill!
--- Nellie ---
We are not alike.
Probably I'd bore him.
He's a cultured Frenchman,
I'm a little hick.
--- Emile ---
Younger man than I,
Officers and doctors.
Probably pursue her,
She could have her pick.
--- Nellie ---
Wonder why I feel
Jittery and jumpy!
I'm like a school girl
Waitin' for a dance.
--- Emile ---
Can I ask her now?
I'm like a school boy!
What will be her answer?
