------ There Is Nothin' like A Dame ------
--- Sailors, Seabees and Marines ---
We got sunlight on the sand,
We got moonlight on the sea,
We got mangoes and bananas
You can pick right off the tree,
We got volleyball and ping-pong
And a lot of dandy games!
What ain't we got?
We ain't got dames!
--- Unknown ---
We get packages from home,
We get movies, we get shows,
We get speeches from our skipper
And advice from Tokyo Rose,
We get letters doused with perfume
We get dizzy from the smell!
What don't we get?
You know darn well!
--- Unknown ---
We have nothin' to put on a clean white suit for
What we need is what there ain't no substitute for...
--- Unknown ---
There is nothin' like a dame,
Nothin' in the world,
There is nothin' you can name
That is anythin' like a dame!
--- Unknown ---
We feel restless, we feel blue,
We feel lonely and in grief,
We feel ev'ry kind of feelin',
But the feelin' of relief
We feel hungry as the wolf felt
When he met Red Hiding-hood
What don't we feel?
We don't feel good!
--- Unknown ---
Lots of things in life are beautiful, but brother,
There is one particular thing that is nothin' whatsoever
In any way, shape or form like any other.
--- Unknown ---
There is nothin' like a dame,
Nothin' in the world,
There is nothin' you can name
That is anythin' like a dame!
--- Unknown ---
Nothin' else was built the same,
Nothin' in the world
As the soft and wavy frame
Like the silhouette of a dame!
--- Unknown ---
There is absolutely nothin' like a frame of a dame.
--- Unknown ---
So suppose that dame and bride
Are completely free from flaws,
Or as faithful as a bird dog,
Or as kind as Santa Claus,
It's a waste of time to worry
Over things that they have not,
We're thankful for the things they got!
--- Unknown ---
There is nothin' you can name
That is anythin' like a dame!
--- Unknown ---
There are no books like a dame,
And nothin' looks like a dame.
There are no drinks like a dame,
And nothin' thinks like a dame,
Nothin' acts like a dame,
Or attracts like a dame.
There ain't a thing that's wrong with any man here
That can't be cured by pullin' him near
