------ This Nearly Was Mine ------
--- Emily ---
One dream in my heart,
One love to be livin' for,
One love to be livin' for
This nearly was mine.
--- Unknown ---
One girl for my dream,
One partner in paradise,
This promise of paradise
This nearly was mine.
--- Unknown ---
Close to my heart she came
Only to fly away,
Only to fly as day flies from moonlight
Now, now I'm alone,
Still dreamin' of paradise,
Still sayin' that paradise
Once nearly was mine.
--- Unknown ---
I'll keep rememberin' kisses
From lips I've never owned,
And all that lovely adventures
That we have never known.
--- Unknown ---
One dream in my heart,
One love to be livin' for,
One love to be livin' for
This nearly was mine.
--- Unknown ---
Close to my heart she came
Only to fly away,
Only to fly as day flies from moonlight.
--- Unknown ---
Now, now I'm alone,
Still a-dreamin' of paradise,
Still sayin' that paradise
