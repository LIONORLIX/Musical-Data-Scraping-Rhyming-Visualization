--- Nellie ---
I'm gonna wash that man right outa my hair,
I'm gonna wash that man right outa my hair,
I'm gonna wash that man right outa my hair,
And send him on his way.
--- Unknown ---
I'm gonna wave that man right outa my arms,
--- Nellie and Girls ---
I'm gonna wave that man right outa my arms,
I'm gonna wave that man right outa my arms,
And send him on his way.
--- Unknown ---
Don't try to patch it up
--- Girls ---
Tear it up, tear it up!
--- Nellie ---
Wash him out, dry him out,
--- Girls ---
Push him out, fly him out,
--- Nellie ---
Cancel him and let him go!
--- Girls ---
Yea, sister!
--- Nellie ---
I'm gonna wash that man right outa my hair,
I'm gonna wash that man right outa my hair,
I'm gonna wash that man right outa my hair,
And send him on his way.

If a man don't understand you,
If you fly on separate beams,
Waste no time, make a change,
Ride that man right off your range.
Rub him out of the roll call
And drum him out of your dreams.
--- Girls ---
Oho! If you laugh at different comics,
If you root for different teams,
Waste no time, weep no more,
Show him what the door is for.
Rub him out of the roll call
And drum him out of your dreams.
--- Nellie ---
You can't light a fire when the woods are wet,
--- Girls ---
No!
--- Nellie ---
You can't make a butterfly strong,
--- Girls ---
Hmm, hmm!
--- Nellie ---
You can't fix an egg when it ain't quite good,
--- Girls ---
And you can't fix a man when he's wrong!
--- Nellie ---
You can't put back a petal when it falls from a flower,
Or sweeten up a fellow when he starts turnin' sour
--- Girls ---
Oh no! Oh no!
--- Nellie and Girls ---
If his eyes get dull and fishy,
When you look for glints and gleams,
Waste no time,
Make a switch,
Drop him in the nearest ditch!
Rub him out of the roll call,
And drum him out of your dreams
Oho! Oho!
--- Nellie ---
I went to wash that man right outa my hair,
I went to wash that man right outa my hair,
I went to wash that man right outa my hair,
And sent him on his way.
--- Girls ---
She went to wash that man right outa my hair,
She went to wash that man right outa my hair,
She went to wash that man right outa my hair,
--- Nellie and Girls ---
