------ Honey Bun ------
--- Nellie ---
My doll is as dainty as a sparrow,
Her figure is somethin' to applaud.
Where she's narrow she's as narrow an arrow,
And she's broad where a broad should be broad.
--- Unknown ---
A hundred and one pounds of fun,
That's my little honey bun!
Get a load of honey bun tonight.
--- Unknown ---
I'm speakin' of my Sweetie Pie,
Only sixty inches high,
Ev'ry inch is packed with dynamite!
--- Unknown ---
Her hair is blond and curly,
Her curls are hurly-burly.
Her lips are pips!
I call her hips 'Twirly' and 'Whirly.'
--- Unknown ---
She's my baby, I'm her pap!
I'm her booby, she's my trap!
I am caught and I don't wanna run,
'Cause I'm havin' so much fun with honey bun!
--- Unknown ---
I am caught and I don't wanna run,
'Cause I'm havin' so much fun with honey bun!
--- Unknown ---
Believe me sonny!
She a cookie who can cook you 'till you're done,
Ain't bein' funny!
