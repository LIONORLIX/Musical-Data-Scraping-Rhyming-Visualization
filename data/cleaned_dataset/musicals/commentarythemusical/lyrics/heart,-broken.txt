A caveman painted on a cave
It was a bison, was a fave
The other cave-people would rave `
They didn`t ask `why??
Why paint a bison if it`s dead
When did you choose the color red
What was the process in your head
He told their story
What came before he didn`t show
We`re not supposed to
--- Unknown ---
Homer`s odyssey was swell
A bunch of guys that went through hell
He told the tale but didn`t tell
The audience why
He didn`t say, here`s what it means
And here`s a few deleted scenes
Charybdis tested well with teens
He`s not the story
He`s just a door we open if
Our lives need lifting
--- Unknown ---
But now we pick pick
Pick pick pick it apart
Open it up to find the
Tick tick tick of a heart
A heart, broken
--- Unknown ---
It`s broken by the endless loads
Of making-ofs and mobisodes
The tie-ins, prequels, games and codes
The audience buys
The narrative dies
Stretched and torn
Hey, spoiler warning:
--- Unknown ---
We`re gonna pick pick
Pick pick pick it apart
Open it up to find the
Tick tick tick of a heart
A heart, broken

Joss, why do you rail against the biz
You know that`s just the way it is
You`re making everybody miz
--- Zack ---
These out-of-date philosophies
Are for the dinner table, please
We have to sell some dvd`s
--- Jed, maurissa, zack ---
Without these things you spit upon
You`d find your fame and fanbase gone
--- Maurissa ---
You`d be ignored at comic-con
--- Joss ---
I sang some things i didn`t mean
Okay, let`s talk about this scene
I think it`s great how ryan green -
Oh this is no good
I thought j-mo would back my play
Now zack and they all say
--- Unknown ---
We`re gonna pick pick
Pick pick pick you apart
Open you up and stop the
Tick tick tick of a heart
--- Unknown ---
A heart?
