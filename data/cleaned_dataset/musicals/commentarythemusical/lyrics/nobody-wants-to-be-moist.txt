------ Nobody Wants To Be Moist ------
--- Unknown ---
Nobody wants to be moist
A bunch of overactive pores
I struggle opening doors
And i lose every tug of war
--- Unknown ---
Nobody wants to be wet
Though sweet soul i do secrete
Can't make damp fingers snap to the beat
--- Unknown ---
The microphone is dripping
My baritone is slipping
A rhyme into this line i'll have to foist
Nobody wants to be moist
--- Unknown ---
Nobody wants to be moist
Though on the dance floor i glide
On stairs i'm petrified
--- Unknown ---
Nobody wants to be soaked
Though it is with a graceful ease
I deduce in which way blows the breeze
--- Unknown ---
Oh sure i have the power
To make paste from a powder
But last time i did that no one rejoiced
Nobody wants to be moist
--- Unknown ---
A man so ancillary
My little song is buried
Not till the commentary is it voiced
Nobody wants to be
Nobody wants to be
Nobody wants to be moist
