------ All About Me ------
--- Maurissa ---
Here`s a tale as old as time and tide
A simple girl, a wanderer
Who grew up starry-eyed
--- Stacy ---
You see me for an instant
You see everything inside
--- Steve ---
No matter what the movie tries to hide
--- Groupies ---
It`s all about me
It`s all about me
--- Maurissa ---
It`s groupie number one
--- Stacy ---
Groupie number two
--- Steve ---
It`s groupie number three
--- Groupies ---
And if i had the screen time i deserved you`d see
--- Maurissa ---
It`s all about me
--- Newscasters ---
Here`s a tale that can be told at last
Of desks that must be sat behind
And news that must be cast
--- Marti ---
The moment is so fleeting
--- David ---
But our talent is so vast
--- Newscasters ---
The so-called stars are hopelessly outclassed
--- Marti ---
It`s all about me
--- David ---
It`s all about me
With all the latest breaking headlines on this tragedy
--- Marti ---
And if i had the screen time i deserve you`d see
--- Newscasters ---
It`s all about me
--- Rob ---
They call me moving guy
Because i move the audience to tears
--- Jed ---
We`re not just chorus boys
--- Bad horse chorus ---
We`ve got a story arc and frothy beers
--- Stacy ---
They`ll never know how much i gave
The film is locked, the door is shut
--- Steve ---
They wouldn`t give me final cut
But what you`d see
--- All ---
Is all about me
It`s all about me
It doesn`t matter where i`m listed on imdb
--- David ---
It`s last, but in the meantime i think you`ll agree
--- David and maurissa ---
Finally
--- All ---
It`s all about
--- Unknown ---
Not them
Not them
Not them`
