------ Strike! ------
--- Unknown ---
When you start negotiations
With integrity and patience
And they just cry ?battle stations!?
What?s to like?
When you ask a small amount and
Then encounter counter?s counter
And the deal is tantamount to
?Take a hike?
You can?t sit around with your head in the sand
You pull it out, you stand up and
You strike
--- Unknown ---
When you hear their lawyers talking
Saying our behavior?s shocking
It?s convincing as a cockney
Dick van dyke
When they leave the town unstable
Then they come back to the table
And say ?now we should able ?
Kidding! Psych!?
We ask them for bread and get ?let them eat cake?
They figure a stomach ache will break
The strike
--- Unknown ---
So strike
For all the writers
Strike
For a living wage
Until these wrongs are righted
We won?t write another page
--- Jed ---
Wipe off that smile ? The style is bile
And rage is all the rage
--- Unknown ---
As the fall turns into winter
There appears a bunch of splinter
Groups who wonder what this inter-
Net is like
While the tide is turning tepid
And the town is feeling trepid-
Atious time for us to step up
To the mic
We?ve got all these dynamite plots to use
It?s time to light the fuse or lose
The strike
--- Joss ---
And lose we did
Impressively
--- All ---
Slunk back to our offices
Declaring victory
If you need your residual
Why did you all agree
--- Unknown ---
I?m proud i walked the line
With writers, fans and friends of mine
But now i ask what was it finally about
And years from now i?ll tell my tyke
Just what it feels like to strike
Out
