------ Commentary (Reprise) ------
--- All ---
Hope you had fun
`Cause now we`re done
You`ve listened to every word
Seeing it through
Makes each of you
A huge f#!king nerd
--- Unknown ---
But you`re unfazed
By the maze of craze malaise
The lazy phrasing betrays
How well this pays
So here`s a toast
To who suffered most
While we coasted through this
--- Neil ---
Commentary!

Commentary
Here`s the big finish
Where we build up the tension
And we get really quiet
Then we stop being quiet
And repeat the title ` Commentary
