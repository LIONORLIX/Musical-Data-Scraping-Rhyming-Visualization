------ Nobody's Asian In The Movies ------
--- Unknown ---
I wrote all penny`s lines and her song, you know
I even sang her part up on the demo
But when it`s time to cast the show
Did they want somebody yellow - hell no
--- Unknown ---
Nobody`s asian in the movies
Nobody`s asian on tv
If there is a part there for us
It`s the groupie in the chorus
That`s me
--- Unknown ---
I begged and i pleaded please don`t pass me by
They say, hey give us a hand
Go stand in the back with that fat guy
My role, though be it brief, at least
It isn`t viet cong, it`s comic relief
--- Unknown ---
Nobody`s asian in the movies
Nobody`s asian on tv
If there is a part there for us
It`s a ninja, a physician
Or a goofy mathematician
Or a groupie in the chorus
That`s me
--- Unknown ---
Who do they want before they want an asian`
A mexican
Who do they want before they want an asian`
A black
Who do they want before they want an asian`
A persian, or a cajun, or an indian
Or an american-indian played by a mexican
Or if you`re lucky someone asian
Like me

But maurissa, movies couldn`t even be made without asians.
We need them to play the parts we`re not willing to.
--- Maurissa ---
You`re right, jed!
--- Unknown ---
Without the asians in the movies
Without the asians on tv
Who`d play the goofy mathematician
The computer technician
A wise old healer from japan
A short but wealthy businessman
Sell korean groceries
Do your laundry thank you, prrease
We`re the victims of a crime
We`ll be loving you long time
If your movie is a bore just
Watch the groupie in the chorus
That`s me
--- Maurissa ---
I guess my parents will be proud of me after all.
--- Jed ---
What does your dad do again`
--- Maurissa ---
Oh!  He`s a nerdy, funny scientist.
