There?s a game on my phone
That i sometimes like to play when i?m alone
Go to google, type it in
Click the extreme edition
And in moments you?ll begin and you?ll be thinking ?

We did not get along

I thought neil was given far too many songs
--- Neil and nathan ---
Both threw insults at each other

Told you how i f#!ked your mother
--- Neil and nathan ---
But what made us tight as brothers and forever one would hope

Careful as you hurtle from one circle to the next
Sometimes double back to dodge the gravity vortex
Two ropes is the key to keep from wheeling way to far
Nathan holds the record -

One nineteen point seven yards

Now the shoot is complete

And into our separate lives we do retreat
--- Neil ---
But instead of solitaire
--- Neil and nathan ---
Sinking deep into despair
--- All ---
It reminds us the connection that we share and helps us cope

Ninja ropes?

You?ve got just one life to fly and dive from place to place
Don?t ask why a ninja can survive in outer space
Friends say, ?hey man can i have a go? And i say, ?nope?
Simple in it?s game play and yet epic in it?s scope
