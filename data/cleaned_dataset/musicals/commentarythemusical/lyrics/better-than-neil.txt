------ Better Than Neil ------
--- Unknown ---
Hey ladies
Sit down, relax
I got a story to tell?
--- Unknown ---
Every night i lie awake
With sorrow in my chest
I think of nph and wonder
Is he getting rest?
Does he know each second
He?s only second best?
--- Unknown ---
Tossing in his bed
What?s he wearing?  Dread?
--- Unknown ---
I?m better
Better than neil
In so many ways
It?s almost unreal
Oh sure he can sing
And piggies can squeal
It?s not a big deal
I?m better
--- Unknown ---
So he was on broadway
While i was on the soaps
Who?s got the high score
On ?ninja ropes??
Who?s got a bullet-proof
Car like the pope?s?
--- Unknown ---
Look at neil mackin?
So sad he?s so lackin?
--- Unknown ---
He makes seven figures
And gets emmy nods
I make seven layer
Bean dip of the gods
I?m also in halo 3
What are the odds?
--- Unknown ---
Now my ears are ringin?
?Cause all the girls are singin?
--- Unknown ---
I?m better
Better than neil
At so many things
It?s hard to conceal
Oh sure he does magic
Magic?s not real
How dumb do you feel?
I?m better
--- Unknown ---
Neil played a kid doctor
Well, so did i, dude
But i was much younger
And totally nude
Neil kept that white coat on
Great, doctor prude
--- Unknown ---
Look there felicia goes
Another deal you couldn?t close, yeah
--- Unknown ---
I wink at a woman
She needs a drink ? Stat!
She knows i get everything
I?m aiming at
Except for the pope car
I lied about that
--- Unknown ---
At least i?m not prone
To singing alone
--- Unknown ---
Look at his smallness
Compared to my tallness
My porcelin doll-ness
My port-in-a-squallness
My kids-in-the-hallness
My pink-floyd?s-?the-wall?ness
My three parts of gaulness
My just all-in-allness
--- Unknown ---
My wonderful  me-ness
My hammer ? The people can tell
That i?m awfully swell
While neil has a weird smell
I?m just saying: purell
--- Unknown ---
I?m better
Better than neil
At ?where do i start?
Romantic appeal
We both went for penny
And who copped a feel?
The true man of steel
I?m better than neil
--- Unknown ---
Yeah yeah yeah
I?m better than neil
Just jumped off a moving
Automobile
He plays with his phone
While tires they squeal
It?s my scene to steal
I?m better than neil
