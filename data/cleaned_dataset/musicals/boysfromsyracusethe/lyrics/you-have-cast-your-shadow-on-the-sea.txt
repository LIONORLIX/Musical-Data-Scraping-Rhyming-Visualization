------ You Have Cast Your Shadow on the Sea ------
--- Unknown ---
He: Let the winds of the seven seas
Blow my good ship where they please
I could never sail away from you;
Through the seas though my bark is hurled
To the edge of this flat old world
You'll be with me till the journey's through
Until I return to you...
--- Unknown ---
You have cast your shadow on the sea
On both the sea and me
Not a shadow dancing in the sun
That fades when day is done.
Although I sail unto the ends of the earth
Your hands will touch my heart,
When you cast your shadow on the sea
You'll be
With me.
--- Unknown ---
She: You have cast your shadow from the sea
On both the land and me
Not a shadow dancing in the sun
That fades when day is done,
Because you've made
This tender shade for my heart
My heart's no longer free,
When you cast your shadow from the sea
You'll be
With me.
