------ The Shortest Day of the Year ------
--- Unknown ---
It rained the day before we met
Then came 3 days that I forget
And then my love we met again
And I remember things from then
I measure time by what we do
And so my calendar is you
--- Unknown ---
The shortest day of the year
Has the longest night of the year
And the longest night is the shortest night with you.
The Smallest Smile on your face
Is the greatest kind of embrace
And a single kiss is a thousand dreams come true
The softest sigh, that is my strongest tie
There?s you, there?s I, what can time do?

Instrumental
your softest sigh, that is my strongest tie
There?s you, there?s I, what can time do?
The shortest day of the year
Has the longest night of the year
