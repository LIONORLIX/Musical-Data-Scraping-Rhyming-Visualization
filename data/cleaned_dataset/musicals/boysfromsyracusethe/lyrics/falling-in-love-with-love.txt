------ Falling in Love With Love ------
--- Unknown ---
I weave with brightly colored strings
to keep my mind off other things;
So, ladies, let your fingers dance
and keep your hands out of romance.
--- Unknown ---
Lovely witches
let the stitches
keep your fingers under control.
--- Unknown ---
Cut the tread but leave
the whole heart whole.
Marry maids can sew and sleep;
wives can only sew and weep!
--- Unknown ---
Falling in love with love is falling for make believe.
Falling in love with love is playing the fool;
Caring too much in such a juvenile fancy.
Learning to trust is just for children in school.
--- Unknown ---
I fell in love with love one night when the moon was full
I was unwise with eyes unable to see.
I fell in love with love, With love everlasting,
