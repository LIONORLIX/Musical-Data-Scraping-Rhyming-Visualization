--- Unknown ---
Announcer: And now the mellow sounds of jimmy early
Jimmy Early: I meant you no harm
I never meant to make you cry
You were the only one I?ve ever loved in my life
And though its hard for me to show it
I have to let you know it
Cuz darling I love you more each day
But the words got in my way
Oh I meant you no harm
And I would die
If you ever said goodbye
I love you, I love you
I meant you no harm
I never never meant to make you cry
You are the only one I?ll ever love in my life

Hold it, hold itm hold it
I cant do it, I cant sing no more sad songs
One two three hit me
Bop be bop, bop be bop be deed bop
Bop be bop, bop yeah
Bass man, huh, come on up
One two three hit me
Uh, sound good, yeah
Saxophone on the floor, one two three, hit it
Yeah, ow, uh, come on
Horns hit it, uh, yeah
Hey girl lets rock with jimmy early
Got a home in the hills, Mercedes benz, hot swimming pool, got lots of friends
Got Clothes by the acre, credit to spare, I could wake up tomorrow and find nobody there
But Jimmy want more, jimmy want more, jimmy want, jimmy want, jimmy want more
Jimmy want a rib, jimmy want a steak, jimmy want a piece of your chocolate cake
And more than all that Jimmy want a raise, cuz
Jimmy got soul, Jimmy got soul, Jimmy got, Jimmy got, Jimmy got soul
Sooner or later
The time comes around
For a man to be a man to take back his sound
I gotta do something to shake things up
I like Johnny Mathis but I cant do that stuff
Cuz Jimmy got soul, Jimmy got soul, Jimmy got S-O-U-L soul
I cant do rock
I cant do roll, what I can do baby is show my soul,
