I miss you, old friend
Can i hold you`
And though it`s been a long time,
Old friend
Do you mind`
There were so many things
I wish i had said
I meant to love you
But i hurt you instead
I`ve come here now
To make amends
Can i sit down beside you`
Can we be close again`
`Cause i... I miss you, old friend
Can i hold you`
And though it`s been a long time,
Old friend
Do you mind`
I`m hoping that you
Will feel this way too
`Cause i miss you, old friend
I miss you
