------ Love You I Do ------
--- Unknown ---
Never met a man
Quite like you
Doing all he can
Making my dreams come true
--- Unknown ---
You’re strong and you’re smart
You've taken my heart
And I give you the rest of me too
--- Unknown ---
You’re the perfect man for me
I love you I do
--- Unknown ---
Mm I love ya
--- Unknown ---
Never ever felt
Quite like this
Good about myself
From our very first kiss
I’m here when you call
you’ve got it all
And confidence like I never knew
--- Unknown ---
You’re the perfect man for me
I love you I do
--- Unknown ---
You've got the charm
You simply disarm me every time
As long as you drive
I’m along for the ride
Your way
You said it before
There wont be a door
that’s closed to us
Putting all my trust in you
Cause you, you’ll always be true, Oh
--- Unknown ---
I never could have known
This would be,
Oh you and you alone
All for me
I know you’re the best
You passed every test
Its almost too good to be true
--- Unknown ---
You’re the perfect man for me
I love you I do
--- Unknown ---
You’re the perfect man for me
I love you I do
