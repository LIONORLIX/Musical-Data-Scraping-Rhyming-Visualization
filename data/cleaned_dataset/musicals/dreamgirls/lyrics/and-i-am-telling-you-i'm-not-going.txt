------ And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going ------
--- Effie ---
And I am telling you
Im not going
You're the best man I'll ever know
There's no way I can ever go
No, no, there's no way
No, no, no, no way I'm living without you
Im not living without you
I dont wanna be free
Im staying
Im staying
And you, and you
You're gonna love me, oohh ooh mm mm
You're gonna love me
--- Unknown ---
And I am telling you
I'm not going
Even though the rough times are showing
There's just no way, there's no way
We're part of the same place
We're part of the same time
We both share the same blood
We both have the same mind
And time and time, we've had so much to see and
No, no, no, no, no, no
Im not waking up tomorrow morning and finding that there's nobody there
--- Unknown ---
Darling there's no way
No, no, no, no way Im living without you
Im not living without you
You see there's just no way, there's no way
--- Unknown ---
Tear down the mountains
Yell, scream, and shout like you can say what you want
Im not walking out
Stop all the rivers, push, strike, and kill
Im not gonna leave you
There's no way I will
--- Unknown ---
And I am telling you
Im not going
You're the best man I'll ever know
There's no way I can ever, ever go
No, no, no, no way
No, no, no, no way Im living without you
Oh, Im not living without you, not living without you
I dont wanna be free
Im staying, Im staying
And you, and you, and you
You're gonna love me
--- Unknown ---
You're gonna love me, yes you are
Ooh ooh love me, ooh ooh ooh love me
Love me, love me, love me, love me
--- Unknown ---
You're gonna love me
