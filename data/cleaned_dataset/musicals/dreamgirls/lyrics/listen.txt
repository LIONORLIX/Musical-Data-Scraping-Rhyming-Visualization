Listen,
To the song here in my heart
A melody I've start
But can't complete
--- Unknown ---
Listen, to the sound from deep within
It's only beginning
To find release
--- Unknown ---
Oh,
the time has come
for my dreams to be heard
They will not be pushed aside and turned
Into your own
all cause you won't
Listen....
--- Chorus ---
Listen,
I am alone at a crossroads
I'm not at home, in my own home
And I tried and tried
To say whats on my mind
You should have known
Oh,
Now I'm done believin you
You don't know what I'm feelin
I'm more than what, you made of me
I followed the voice
you gave to me
But now I gotta find, my own..
--- Unknown ---
You should have listened
There is someone here inside
Someone I'd thought had died
Sooo long ago
--- Unknown ---
Ohh I'm free now and my dreams to be heard
They will not be pushed aside on words
Into your arms
All cause you won't
Listen...
--- Chorus ---
--- Unknown ---
I don't know where I belong
But i'll be movin on
If you don't....
If you won't....
--- Unknown ---
LISTEN!!!...
To the song here in my heart
A melody I've start
But I will complete
--- Unknown ---
Oh,
Now i'm done believin you
You dont know what I'm feelin
I'm more than what, you made of me
I followed the voice, you think you gave to me
But now I gotta find, my own..
