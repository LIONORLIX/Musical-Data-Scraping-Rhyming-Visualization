------ Perfect World ------
--- TEDDY, ---
Ev'ry day at school girl
I see your smiling face
The teacher tries to call on me
But I can't concentrate, hey hey
I'm to busy thinking
All about you, babe
I know I'm in love with you
But you dont even know my name
Girl meets boy, boy meets girl
They could fall in love in a perfect world
But if boy and girl ever meet
Then a perfect world can never be
--- Unknown ---
(Spoken) Come on girl
--- BACKUPS, ---
Come on
--- TEDDY, ---
(Spoken) I love ya'!
--- BACKUPS, ---
Come on
--- TEDDY, ---
Every night I dream girl
That you would notice me
I've got a secret crush on you
But we dont even speak, no no
I dont know my studies
Or if 2 plus 2 is 5
But I know I'm in love with you
And you dont even know I'm alive
Girl meets boy, boy meets girl
They could fall in love in a perfect world
But if boy and girl ever meet
Then a perfect world can never be
