------ Heavy ------
--- Unknown ---
Heavy, Heavy
You got so heavy, baby
Heavy, Heavy
You got so heavy on me
--- DEENA, ---
You used to be so light and free
You used to smile just looking at me
Now all you give is jealous hate
Come on bab better lose some weight
--- CHORUS, ---
Heavy, Heavy
You got so heavy, baby
Heavy, Heavy
You got so heavy on me
--- DEENA, ---
You used to want nothing from me
You used to say Let's both be free
You used to dance instead of walk
YOu never had to talk, talk, talk
--- CHORUS, ---
Heavy, Heavy
You got so heavy, baby
Heavy, Heavy
You got so heavy on me
