My mother, who got me into this business,
always told me make them beg for more and then...don't give it to them,
but I'm not my mother!
So if you beg for more,

And we'll have a real good...beg.

Gypsy
Pick up your apples girls and back to the trees!
Bon soir, monsieur et monsieur!
Je m'appelle Gypsy Rose Lee
Et je suis dans le jardin de ma mere et Minksy.
And that concludes my entire performance in French,
I've been too busy learning Greek
Some men accused me of being an ecdysiast
Do you know what that means? Do you?
Do you? Oh, you don't!
He's embarrassed!
Don't be embarrassed... I like men without hair!
Don't worry fellas I know you're up there and up there you know what ecdysiast means.
An ecdysiast is one who or that which
Sheds its skin in vulgar parlors: a stripper
But I'm not a stripper!
At these prices I'm an ecdysiast!
And if you're real good
I'll make you feel good
I want you spirit to climb
Let me entertain you
And well have a real good time, yes, sir!
We'll have...
A real good time!
