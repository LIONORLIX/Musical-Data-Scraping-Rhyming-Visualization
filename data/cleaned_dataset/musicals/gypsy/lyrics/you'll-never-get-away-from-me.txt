------ You'll Never Get Away From Me ------
--- Unknown ---
Rose
Herbie, why don't you get angry on the outside,
instead of letting it settle in your stomach?
--- Unknown ---
Herbie
Because I'm afraid.
--- Unknown ---
Rose
Of me?
--- Unknown ---
Herbie
Of me.
--- Unknown ---
Rose
What do you mean?
--- Unknown ---
Herbie
If ever let loose,
It'll end with me
Picking up and walking.
--- Unknown ---
Rose
Only around
The block.
--- Unknown ---
Herbie
No.
--- Unknown ---
Rose
Don't say that.
You'll never get away from me.
You can climb the tallest tree.
I'll be there somehow.
--- Unknown ---
True, you could say, "Hey, here's your hat."
But a little thing like that
couldn't stop me now.
--- Unknown ---
I couldn't get away from you,
even if you told me to,
so go on and try.
Just try and you're gonna see
how you're gonna not at all
get away from me.
--- Unknown ---
Herbie
Rose, I love you, but don't count your chickens.
--- Unknown ---
Rose
Come dance with me.
--- Unknown ---
Herbie
I warn you that I'm no Boy Scout.
--- Unknown ---
Rose
Relax awhile, come dance with me.
--- Unknown ---
Herbie
So don't think that I'm easy pickin'.
--- Unknown ---
Rose
The music's so nice.
--- Unknown ---
Herbie
Rose, 'cause I just may some day pick up and pack out.
--- Unknown ---
Rose
Oh, no you don't. No, not a chance.
No arguments, shut up and dance.
--- Unknown ---
Rose
You'll never get away from me.
You can climb the tallest tree.
I'll be there somehow.
True, you could say, Hey, here's your hat.
--- Unknown ---
Rose & Herbie
But a little
--- Unknown ---
Herbie
thing like that
couldn't stop me now.
--- Unknown ---
Rose & Herbie
I couldn't get away from you,
even if I wanted to.
--- Unknown ---
Rose
Well, go on and try.
Just try
--- Unknown ---
Herbie
Ah, Rose.
--- Unknown ---
Rose
and you're gonna see
--- Unknown ---
Herbie
Ah, Rose
--- Unknown ---
Rose
how you're gonna not at all
--- Unknown ---
Rose & Herbie
get away from me.
