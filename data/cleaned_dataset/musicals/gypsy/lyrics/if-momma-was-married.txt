------ If Momma Was Married ------
--- LOUISE ---
(Spoken)I wish Momma would marry a plain man so we could all be together...
(Sung)If Momma was married
We'd live in a house
As private as private can be
Just Momma, three ducks, five canaries,
A mouse, two monkeys, one father, six turtles
And me...
If Momma was married
--- JUNE ---
If Momma was married....
If Momma was married
I'd jump in the air
And give all my toe shoes to you
I'd get all those hair ribbons
Out of my hair
And once and for all
I'd get Momma out too...
If Momma was married
--- BOTH ---
Momma! Get out your white dress!
--- LOUISE ---
You've done it before
--- JUNE ---
Without much success!
--- BOTH ---
Momma, God speed and God bless
We're not keeping score
What's one more or less
Oh, Momma, say Yes
And waltz down the hall
While you may
--- LOUISE ---
I'll gladly support you
I'll even escort you...
--- JUNE ---
And I'd gladly give you away
--- BOTH ---
Oh, Momma, get married today!
--- JUNE ---
If Momma was married there wouldn't be anymore:
Let me entertain you, let me make you smile!
I would do some kicks!
--- Unknown ---
LOUISE:"I would do some tricks!"
--- JUNE ---
Sing out, Louise!
--- LOUISE ---
Smile, baby!
Momma, please take our advice
We aren't The Lunts
--- Unknown ---
JUNE:I'm not Fanny Brice
--- BOTH ---
Momma, we'll buy you the rice
If only this once
You wouldn't think twice
It could be so nice
If Momma got married to stay
--- LOUISE ---
But Momma gets married
--- JUNE ---
And...
--- LOUISE ---
Married
--- JUNE ---
And...
--- LOUISE ---
Married
--- BOTH ---
And never gets carried away
Oh, Momma...
Oh, Momma...
Oh, Momma...
