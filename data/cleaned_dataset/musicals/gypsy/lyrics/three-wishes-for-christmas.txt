------ Three Wishes For Christmas ------
--- Tulsa ---
If I had three wishes for Christmas.
I'd make my first wish for a tree.
I'd make my second for a gift from someone
A remembrance from one who is dear to me
--- Unknown ---
I'd make my third for a snow ball.
and if my three wishes came true.
On Christmas night I'd light my tree.
The snow falling silently.
and open my Christmas present from you
