------ Fie on Goodness ------
--- CHORUS ---
Fie on goodness, fie
Fie on goodness, fie
Eight years of kindness to your neighbor
Making sure that the meek are treated well
Eight years of philanthropic labor
Derry down dell
Damn, but it's hell
Oh, fie on goodness, fie
Fie, fie, fie
--- Unknown ---
It's been depressing all the way (derry down, derry down)
And getting glummer every day (derry down, derry down)
--- Unknown ---
KNIGHT 1
Ah, but to burn a little town or slay a dozen men
Anything to laugh again
--- ALL ---
Oh, fie on goodness, fie
Fie, fie, fie, fie, fie
--- Unknown ---
KNIGHT 1
When I think of the rollicking pleasures that earlier filled my life
Lolly lo, lolly lo
Like the time I beheaded a man who was beating his naked wife
--- ALL ---
Lolly lo, lolly lo
--- Unknown ---
KNIGHT 1
I can still hear his widow say
Never moving from where she lay
Tell me what can I do, I beg, sir, of you
Your kindness to repay
--- ALL ---
Fie on goodness, fie
Fie on goodness, fie
--- Unknown ---
KNIGHT 2
Lechery and vice have been arrested
--- Unknown ---
KNIGHT 3
Arrested!

KNIGHT 2
Not a maiden is evermore in threat
Virgins may wander unmolested
--- Unknown ---
KNIGHT 4
Unmolested!
--- ALL ---
Lolly lo let
Gad, it's a sweat
Oh, fie on goodness, fie
Fie, fie, fie, fie, fie
--- Unknown ---
KNIGHT 5
How we roared and brawled in Scotland
Not a law was e'er obeyed
And when wooing called in Scotland
We'd grab any pasing maid
Ah, my heart is still in Scotland
Where the lasses woo the best
On some bonny hill in Scotland
Stroking someone's bonny...
--- CHORUS ---
Fie on Scotland, fie
Fie on Scotland, fie
--- Unknown ---
No one repents for any sin now
Every soul is immaculate and trim
--- SOME KNIGHTS ---
Immaculate!
--- CHORUS ---
No one is covered with chagrin now
Lolly lo lim
Gad, but it's grim
Oh, fie on goodness, fie
Fie, fie, fie
--- Unknown ---
There's not a folly to deplore
Derry down, derry down
Confession Sunday is a bore
Derry down, derry down
--- Unknown ---
KNIGHT 1
Ah, but to spend a tortured evening staring at the floor
Guilty and alive once more
--- CHORUS ---
Oh, fie on virtue, fie
Fie on mercy, fie
Fie on justice
Fie on goodness
