------ Before I Gaze at You Again ------
--- Unknown ---
Before I gaze at you again
I'll need a time for tears.
Before I gaze at you again
Let hours turn to years.
--- Unknown ---
I have so much forgetting to do
Before I try to gaze again at you.
--- Unknown ---
Stay away until you cross my mind
Barely once a day.
Stay away until I wake and find
That I can smile and say:
--- Unknown ---
That I shall gaze at you again
Without a blush or qualm.
My eyes will shine like new again,
My manner poised and calm.
--- Unknown ---
No sign of fear,
Not even a sigh.
And so till when
We gaze again, Goodbye!
Goodbye!
