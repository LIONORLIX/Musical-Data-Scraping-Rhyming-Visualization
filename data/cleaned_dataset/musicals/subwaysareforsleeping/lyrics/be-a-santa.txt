------ Be a Santa ------
--- Unknown ---
Be a Santa, jolly Santa, happy Santa
Give the world a merry Christmas
Be Chris Cringle, bells will jingle
What you bring will fill the world with joy
--- Unknown ---
Come on and twink that twinkle, wrinkle your eyes
Buckle your chins, bring out your bell
Remember wink and giggle, wiggle your beard
Keep up your grins, get out and sell the spell
of all No?l No?l
--- Unknown ---
Be a Santa, roly Santa, holy Santa
Spread the word ?A merry Christmas?
Be so jolly that with holly and by golly
everyone will love you if you?ll be a Santa Clause
--- Unknown ---
Grab your belly, then let go,
shake like jelly too and throw (hahahahahaha hohohoho)
a roar and bellow in the snow,
like a mellow buffalo (hahahahahaha hohohohohoho)
