Rusty: I was robbed that wasn't fair.
--- Unknown ---
G.B: Oh boy you lost!
--- Unknown ---
Rusty: That C.B he never took of the brake!
--- Unknown ---
C.B: Who me?
--- Unknown ---
Rusty: That he did it for the other two's sake.
--- Unknown ---
C.B: So what?
--- Unknown ---
G.B.: Still don't get you anywhere.
--- Unknown ---
C.B: That's how it goes.
--- Unknown ---
Greaseball: Hey C.B you did that good!
--- Unknown ---
C.B: Wow, Greaseball, Thanks!
Did it look like I was holding him back?
--- Unknown ---
Greaseball + Electra: No way!
--- Unknown ---
Electra: Looked like everything was totally slack.
--- Unknown ---
C.B: Mind you.
After all these years it should.
--- Unknown ---
Greaseball: No one would know.
--- Unknown ---
Pearl: Hey hold on.
Don't tell me that C.B's the reason that he went so slow.
--- Unknown ---
Greaseball: 'Cause it was. He had his order. So now you'll know.
--- Unknown ---
Pearl: I go tell the marshalls!
--- Unknown ---
Greaseball: You're in it as well. They'll only suspend you, if you ever tell.
--- Unknown ---
Pearl: This wasn't how I wanted it.
This wasn't what I saw.
Each time I try it seems that I get further from my vision then before!
--- Unknown ---
C.B: Ten four good buddy
Trust no one on the track!
--- Unknown ---
Rusty: That's the last time I race with you.
--- Unknown ---
C.B: That's right, the rerun is for just those two.
The true real engines.
Big strong engines
Call yourself an engine?
You're no engine!
Ten ? ten never again
You're no engine!
Ten ? seven got no heaven // gone to heaven
You're no engine!
