We carry weight 'cos we are freight
And freight is great.

We never sulk.We hulk the bulk.
'Cos freight is great.
We never make a fuss. We got the goods on us.
We take the loads from off the roads
And freight is great.
COACHES
That's brilliant
Don't you wish you'd thought of that?
--- Unknown ---
One more time!
Did you think of that all by yourselves?
It's so profound!
--- Unknown ---
Well I certainly learned something today!
--- Unknown ---
You just listen to what the coach says!
--- COACHES ---
Couldn't stand gravel and sand,
Being ignored, no-one aboard,
Nodoby complaining we were late again.
I should hate carrying freight, nobody living in me.
Got to be a living, breathing passenger train.

Freight/Couldn't stand gravel and sand,
Being ignored, no-one aboard,
Is great/Nodoby complaining we were late again.
We carry weight/I should hate carrying freight, nobody living in me.
And freight is great/Got to be a living, breathing passenger train.
It's mommas and poppas/ it's commerce and hoppers,
It's daughters and sons/it's quaters and tons,
They get in your hair/it's the fun of the fair,
Freight!/Folks!/Tares!/Fares!
Passengers, commuters and mail/
Trees and meat, gravel and shale/
Are great, are great, are great, are great, are great!
CONTROL
Control. Control. You wagons and passenger cars just cut it out.
Trucks will identity themselves. Box cars:
ROCKY I
I'm Rocky, there's lots like me.
ROCKY II
I'm Rocky two.
ROCKY III
I'm Rocky three.
ROCKIES
The only time we get sick inside
Is when some bum hitches a ride.
We wait for a sharp corner to come
And open the door - bye bye bum!
TRUCKS
Freight is great!
CONTROL
Brick truck.
FLAT-TOP
Flat-Top - who you looking at?

The big hopper.
FLAT-TOP
Dustin, that's you, mate.
CONTROL
Come on, the big hopper.
FLAT-TOP
Come on, Dustin.
DUSTIN
I'm the big hopper, I'm not a box.
ROCKIES
Yeah, your head is full of rocks.
DUSTIN
They're not rocks, they're bits of gravel.
Gravel's got a right to travel.
DUSTIN AND FLAT-TOP
Travellin' with gravel in.
Praying that we don't get wet.
Water and mortar
Do things they didn't oughter.
Empty me before I set.
TRUCKS
Down the track from A to B and back
We carry things not people -
People talk a lot -
That isn't what we like.
COACHES
They're strong and silent!
TRUCKS
None of us may be a genius
But we know one thing -
What we know is:
Freight is great.
Freight is great.
