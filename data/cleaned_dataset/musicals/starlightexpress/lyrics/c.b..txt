See the news on you TV
Rail disaster
Ever wonder why was he
Getting faster
Every time the red caboose
Takes a train
Seems to loose it's braking shoes
Can't explain

Wide smile, high style, that's me
Out front, in back, C.B.

Hiding at the back of the freight train
Unsupected
When they robbed the great train
I collected
While the feds shake their heads
I'm on the loose
There each time at the scene of the crime
The red caboose

Wide smile, high style, that's me
Out front, in back, C.B.
Wrong side of the track C.B.

The state police they don't suspect
I got old ninety seven wrecked
Interpol don't know that I
Crossed the bridge on the river Kwai
Seems like any train that takes me
Just doesn't get the brakes
Somebody go fetch a cop
Another train just failed to stop

Ten four Smokey bear
I could be anywhere
You know I'm to blame
But you don't know my name
