------ Next Time You Fall In Love ------
--- Pearl ---
I'm guess im not too good at keeping love alive for long.
I think ive found the answers but the answers always wrong.
My first love was my true love and it should have been my last.
The only time im happys when im dreaming in the past.
--- Pearl Chorus ---
Next time you fall in love it better be with me the way it used to be.
Back then, was when we touched the Starlight.
--- Pearl ---
Sometimes you turn away from what your heart tells you is right,
And so you settle for whatever gets you through the night.
The flame you thought was dead may sudenely begin too burn.
And broken hearts can be repaired thats somthing that you learn.
--- Pearl ---
repeat chorus
--- Rusty ---
Ive relived every moment that i've ever shared with you.
What fools we were to end a dream that looked like coming true.

I guess im not too good at keeping love alive for long.
I think ive found the answers but the answers always wrong.
My first love was my true love and it should have been my last.
The only time im happys when im dreaming in the past.
