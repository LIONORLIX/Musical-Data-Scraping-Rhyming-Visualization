------ U.N.C.O.U.P.L.E.D. ------
--- DINAH ---
I've been U.N.C.O.U.P.L.E.D
I can't bring myself to say it. No siree
I'm a carriage with no marriage
I'm a van without a man
I've been U.N.C.O.U.P.L.E.D
Was I corroded or overloaded
Maybe I shamed him
Who could have blamed him
If he thought me second-class
Went in search of chrome and brass
Went to find some other fool like me
And I'm just U.N.C.O.U.P.L.E.D
I can't seem to stop C.R.Y.I.N.G
People look and me and think,
There she goes the missing link
She's been U.N.C.O.U.P.L.E.D
And I'm just U.N.C.O.U.P.L.E.D
But I'll get my R.E.V.E.N.G.E
He'll come crawling back one day
And I'll turn to him and say
------ fin ------
