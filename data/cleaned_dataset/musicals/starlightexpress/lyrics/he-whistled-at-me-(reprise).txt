------ He Whistled at Me (Reprise) ------
--- Unknown ---
Dinah-
I'm fed up with all this racing,
This electric thin i'm chasing,
Dosent have that certain something,
That a girl expects to hear,
--- Unknown ---
He never whistles at me!
It's damaging my staus,
I dont think he can whistle at me!
He lacks the aparatus,
Why do you never whistle at me?
Beginnig to suspect you!
I need someone to whistle at me,
Gonna disconnect you,
