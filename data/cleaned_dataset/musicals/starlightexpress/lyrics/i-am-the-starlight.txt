Starlight Express, Starlight Express...
--- STARLIGHT ---
Only you have the power within you.
Just believe in yourself -
The sea will part before you,
Stop the rain, turn the tide.
If only you use the power within you
Needn't beg the world
To turn around and help you
If you draw on what you have within you
Somewhere deep inside.
--- RUSTY ---
Starlight Express, Won't you confess,
Are you real, yes or no?
Starlight Express, answer me yes.
I don't want you to go.
--- STARLIGHT ---
Rusty you're blind, look in your mind -
I'm there. Nothing's new
The Starlight Express is no more nore less
Than you Rusty. I am you.
I'm you and

Only you/I am the Starlight.
Have the power within you/I can achieve
Just believe in yourself/anything
The sea will part before you
Stop the rain and turn the tide/
All the things I didn't believe.
If only you/I am the Starlight.
Have the power within you/I can achieve
Just believe in yourself/anything
The sea will part before you
Stop the rain and turn the tide/
All the things I didn't believe.
If only you/I am the Starlight,
Use the power within you/I can see it throught.
Needn't beg the world to turn around and help you
If you draw on what is deep inside.
