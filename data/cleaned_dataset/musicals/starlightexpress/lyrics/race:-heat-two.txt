Control, control. Heat Two. Trains to your tracks. Ten, nine, eight, seven,
six, five, four, three, two, one. Trains gone! They've set out for the
second heat and Poppa's in back and struggling. He's on the crossing. Look
out Poppa! Leaping locomotives! Still Bobo with Turnov pressing in second
but Bobo wastes the ration. Hey, Bobo, you lost your coach! That puts
Ruhrgold in lead but Turnov's not having any! It's Turnov, the Russian lead.
Ouch, Poppa shows Turnov he still packs a punch! Poppa's taking the lead but
Dustin takes him wide letting Ruhrgold through. It's Ruhrgold, Turnov, Bobo
and Poppa coming out of the high lever. And Ruhrgold stops - this is getting
really mean! Bobo goes through to take the lead. Poppa's turning on the
power, they approach the tunnel. The old guy does it! Winner of Heat Two :
Poppa McCoy with Bobo in second place. Poppa and Bobo have a place in the
