------ He Whistled at Me ------
--- PEARL AND COACHES ---
Whoo-whoo, whoo-whoo - nobody can do it like a steam train.
Whoo-whoo, whoo-whoo - everybody's waiting for their dream train.
PEARL
I'll know him when I see him
For long before I see him
I will hear the far off signal
I will hear the Distant call
And then he'll whistle at me.
He'll send a not and woo me.
He'll whistle at me,
I'm gonna hitch him to me.
Some day soon he'll whistle at me,
That's how I'll recognise him
And maybe I will whistle at him -
That should surprise him.
Don't give me insistent humming,
Horns and bells and distant drumming,
I want steam that's under pressure
As it rises to a scream,
Somebody whistle at me,
I'm all anticipation.
I need someone to whistle at me,
I'm waiting at the station.
Come on, soneone whistle at me,
I'm longing to be near him.
I need someone to whistle at me -
I'll know him when I hear him.
