------ Race: Heat Three ------
--- Control ---
This is control. This is control. And now for the race that keeps going day
and night. The final Trans-America trial for the championship of the world.
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. Trains gone!
Here's a surprise-look at that Rusty go. He passes Bobo. He's got a head of
steam and he's mad to show the big boys. He's chasing Electra. He's chasing
Greaseball. What's the champion gonna go about it? Oh my God! Race
cancelled. Race cancelled. Who did that? Re-run in fifteen minutes.
