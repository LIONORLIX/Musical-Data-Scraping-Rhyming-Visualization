------ No Comeback ------

Electra
Clear my track, you've had your chance now
I'll find another line, no comeback
--- Unknown ---
Losing's not my style
So i can't show my face now
Find another place now
Didn't win so i'll go
Don't try to persuade me
Losing always wrecks it
This is my last exit
Stand by to fade me
--- Unknown ---
No comeback, this is the last time
We'll never meet again, no comeback
No comeback, this is the last time
We'll never meet again, no comeback
--- Unknown ---
No come, no come, no come, no come
No comeback, no comeback
No come, no come, no come, no come
No comeback, no comeback
--- Unknown ---
Adieu mon ami, addio mia cara
Auf weidersein mein leib, sayonara
Eat my dust
--- Unknown ---
No comeback, this is the last time
We'll never meet again, no comeback
No comeback, this is the last time
We'll never meet again, no comeback
