------ Starlight Express ------
--- RUSTY ---
When you good nights have been said
And you are lying in bed
With the covers pulled up tight
And though you count every sheep
You get the feeling that sleep
Is going to stay away tonight.
That's when you hear it coming
That is when you hear the humming of the
Starlight Express, Starlight Express,
Are you real, yes or no?
Starlight Express, answer me yes.
I don't want you to go.
Want you to take me away
But bring me home before daylight
And in the time between
Take me to everywhere
But don't abandon me there
Just want to say I've been.
I believe in you completely
Though I may be dreaming sweetly of the
Starlight Express, answer me yes.
I don't want you to go.
And if you're there
And if you know
Then show me which way
I should go.
Starlight Express, Starlight Express,
Are you real, yes or no?
Starlight Express, answer me yes.
