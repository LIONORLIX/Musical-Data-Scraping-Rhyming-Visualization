------ One Rock & Roll Too Many ------
--- GREASEBALL AND ELECTRA ---
One Rock 'n' Roll too many,
One night's sleep too few.
Too much ringing that bell
Takes its toll out of you.
GREASEBALL
The sound's too loud.
ELECTRA
The light's too bright.
GREASEBALL
My chains are too heavy
And my pants are too tight.
BOTH
One Rock 'n' Roll too many,
Takes its toll... out of you.
One Rock 'n' Roll too many,
I can't take no more.
GREASEBALL
Whaddya say?
ELECTRA
I can't hear nothing.
GREASEBALL
Whaddya say?
ELECTRA
I can't hear nothing.
GREASEBALL
I can't hear nothing.
ELECTRA
Whaddya say?
BOTH
I said one Rock 'n' Roll too many
Takes its toll...
And the soul...
