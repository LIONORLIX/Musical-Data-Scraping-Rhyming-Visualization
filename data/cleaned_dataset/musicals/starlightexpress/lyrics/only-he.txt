------ Only He ------
--- Unknown ---
Look at me a woman, calm and in control
No silly girl whose head's always turning
Nobody would guess that deep inside my soul
A brand new flame is burning
--- Unknown ---
Only he has the power to move me
And together we'd make the whole world move in sympathy
But I couldn't see before
That only he has the power to move me
Take me, hold me, mold me, change me and improve me
It's not funny anymore
--- Unknown ---
Only he can make my burden light
Only he can make a wrong seem right
Only he can make the shadows bright
And make the darkness gleaming white
He
Him and me
Only he has the power to move me
--- Unknown ---
All the nights I've wasted dreaming of the time
When I'd discover the one to guide me
Searching the horizon, didn't realize
That all the time he was beside me
--- Unknown ---
Only he has the power to move me
And together we'd make the whole world move in sympathy
Hope and pray that I'm in time
Only he can stand and wait that long
Stand by me while I was going wrong
What if he couldn't wait?
Have I left it too late?
--- Unknown ---
Only he has the power to move me
And together we'd make the whole world move in sympathy
Him and me we'd be sublime
And he still would never guess
That next time I'm gonna answer yes
Does he know if he comes back today,
This time I'm gonna make him stay?
He
Only he
Only he has the power every day, every hour
He moves me
