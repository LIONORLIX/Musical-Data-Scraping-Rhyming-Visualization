------ Race: Uphill Final ------
--- Control ---
Control. Control. Re-run of championship on downhill course. Ten, nine,
eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. It's Greaseball, Electra,
Bobo and Rusty as they come down from the high level and Electra passes the
champion. Bobo passes the champion. Something's holding the champion back.
It's Pearl, and the chammpion doesn't like that one bit. Oh, no - he's
uncoupled Pearl. We have a runaway. Pearl's heading for the edge and Rusty
saves her. That was courageous. The champion's racing solo. That's not
allowed. Not for long. Greaseball takes Ashley and Bobo's out of it. Back at
the high level now with Electra leading and the champion is second. It looks
like Rusty's bid has failed. Can't anyone take the electric superstar? Can
the champion comme back? It's Electra and the champion disputing the lead.
Rusty comes through. Electra zaps the champion. Against all the odds, Rusty
is the champion. Rusty for lap of honour.
--- Rusty ---
I must find Pearl. I must find Pearl.
