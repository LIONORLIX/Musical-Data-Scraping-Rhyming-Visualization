------ Only You ------
--- Unknown ---
Rusty
Only you
Have the power to move me
And together we'll make
The whole world move in sympathy
But I could not see before
Pearl
Only you
Have the power to move me
Both
Take me, hold me, mould me
Change me and improve me
Rusty
It's not funny anymore.
There was I
Pearl
There was I
Rusty
Wondering why
Pearl
I was wondering why
Rusty
Every day
Both
Disappeared into the distance
Pearl
Now with you
The light is shining through
Both
You gave me life not just existence
Rusty
Only you
Pearl
You are the starlight
Rusty
Have the power to move me
Both
And together we'll make
The whole world move in sympathy
Rusty
Only you,
Have the power to move me
Pearl
Move me
There was I
Rusty
There was I
Pearl
Wondering why
Rusty
Wondering why
Both
Every day disappeared into the distance
Now with you
The light is shining through
You gave me life not just existence
Pearl
Only you
Rusty
Only you
Both
Have the power to move me
And together we'll make
The whole world move in sympathy
Pearl
But I could not see before
Rusty
I couldn't see it before
Pearl
That only you
Both
Have the power to move me
Take me, hold me, mould me
Change me and improve me
Pearl
Only you
Rusty
Only you,
Pearl
Have the power
Both
