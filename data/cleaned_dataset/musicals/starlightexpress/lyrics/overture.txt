--- CONTROL ---
This is control. This is control. Tonight is the most important night in the
history of the world. Take your seats for the World Championship Railroad
Race. Trains to your tracks. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four,
three, two, one. Trains gone! Four trains going for two final places.
Greaseball and Expresso are the early leaders with Nintendo pressing in
third. This is turning into a real grudge match. And here's a surprise: look
at that Rusty go.
MOTHER
Put those trains away.
CONTROL
Oh Mum - just five more minutes.
MOTHER
Put those trains away and get into bed.
CONTROL
But...
MOTHER
No buts.
CONTROL
Starlight Express, Starlight Express
Are you real - yes or no ?
