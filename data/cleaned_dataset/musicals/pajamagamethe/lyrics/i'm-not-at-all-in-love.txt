All you gotta do is say hello to a man
And they've got you whispering in his ear
--- Unknown ---
All you gotta is be Polite with him
And they've got you spending the night with HIM
--- Unknown ---
If there's a guy you merely have a bicker with
They've got you setting the wedding date
--- Unknown ---
It seems they've just gotta have some dirt
To bend your ear with
--- Unknown ---
So before you start
I hear with...state
--- Unknown ---
I'm not, at all in love, not at all in love, not I!
Not a bit
Not a might
Though I'll admit he's quite a hunk a guy
--- Unknown ---
But he's not, my cup of tea, not my cup of tea, not he!
Not an ounce
Not a pinch
He's just an inch, too sure of himself for me
--- Unknown ---
Girl: Well of course you've noticed his manly physique and that look in his eye
Girl: Well I'm sure he can cut almost any man out of size!
Girl: He must he as fierce as a tiger when he's mad
Girl: And I'll bet he cries like a little boy when he's sad
--- Unknown ---
Babe: But I'm not at all in love, not at all in love not I!
Not a straw
Not a hair
I don't care if he's as strong as a lion
Or if he has the rest of you sighing
You may be sold but this girl aint buying!!
I'm not at all in love!

Cuz she's not at all in love, not at all in love, she cries!

Babe: Not a snip, not a bite
Girls: Must be the light from the ceiling shining there in her eyes
He's young and handsome, and smart, and we can't get over it
--- Unknown ---
Babe: but this ladies heart he doesn't effect a bit

Girls: It's easy to see that her daffy grin is a grin she always wears
And she's breathless because she ran up a flight of stairs!
