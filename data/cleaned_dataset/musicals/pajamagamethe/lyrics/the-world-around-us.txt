------ The World Around Us ------
--- Unknown ---
The world around us is trying to tear us apart
But let’s let them know they’re trying in vain
Alone we each may wind up the loser
Together we’ve so much to gain
The love that found us may not be a storybook romance
We’ve had our ups and downs
But let’s not complain
Just come to my arms and know we’ve got nothing to fear
And let the world around us disappear
--- Unknown ---
The love that found us may not be a storybook romance
We’ve had our ups and downs
But let’s not complain
Just come to my arms and know we’ve nothing to fear
