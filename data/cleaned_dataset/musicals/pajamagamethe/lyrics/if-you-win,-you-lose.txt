------ If You Win, You Lose ------
--- Unknown ---
Watch those eyes ol’ girl
They have got you down to a science
If he tries ol’ girl
Stand your ground and show your defiance
What to do, where to turn
How to choose
Watch your heart ol’ girl
If you win, you lose
--- Unknown ---
Forget him,	(Better forget her)
Just take it all in your stride. (Her with her nose in the sky)
Don't let him make you fall apart, (She has you dancing on a string)
You've always had such pride. (She won’t care for me)
What to do, (what to do) where to turn (where to turn)
How to choose (how to choose)
Watch your hands ol’ girl
Watch your heart ol’ girl (Am I too much in love)
