------ A New Town Is a Blue Town ------

Sid
A new town is a blue town
A who do you know and show me what you can do town
There's no red carpet at your feet.
If you're not tough they'll try to beat you down
In a new blue town
It's not like the old town
You don't take long to find that you're in a cold town
But you know you can lick it
Didn't buy a round trip ticket
To this
Cold cold new blue town.
Well nobody asked me to come here
And nobody asked me to stay
Made up my own mind
And I know I'll find my own way.
Since that first day when I said Hi town
They've damned well tried to make me say goodbye town
But I won't leave until I make it my town they'll see
This one horse two bit hick of a new town
Ain't gonna lick me
