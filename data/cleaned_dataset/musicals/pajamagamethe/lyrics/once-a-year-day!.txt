------ Once A Year Day! ------

Sid: This is my once-a-year day
Once-a-year day
Felt the morning sun and knew that
This was my once-a-year day
once-a-year day
Even got a kiss from you,
I feel like hoppin' up and down
Like a kangaroo
Jumpin' fences, climbin' trees,
What pleases me is what I'll do, 'cause
--- Unknown ---
Chorus: This is our once-a-year day
once-a-year day
Everyone's entitle to be wild,
be a child, be a goof, raise the roof
Once a year!
This is our once-a-year day
once-a-year day
once a year we're jumping fences
This is our once-a-year day
once-a-year day
Once a year we lose our senses!

Babe: Look at Charlie up a tree
Kissin' Katie's ear,
Charlie's wife is mad as hell!
--- Unknown ---
Chorus: Oh well it happens once a year
And this is that once-a-year day
once-a-year day
Everyone's entitle to be wild,
be a child, be a goof, raise the roof
Once a year!

Poopsie: Look at Papa Halterbush,
92 today
Running off with Sadie Lee

Chorus: He's heading for that pile of hay
Coz this is his once-a-year day
once-a-year day
Everyone's entitle to be wild,
be a child, be a goof, raise the roof
