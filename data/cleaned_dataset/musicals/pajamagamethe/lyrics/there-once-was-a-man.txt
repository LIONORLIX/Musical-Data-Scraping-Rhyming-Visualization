------ There Once Was a Man ------
--- Unknown ---
There once was a man who loved a woman
She was the one he slew a dragon for
They say that nobody ever loved as much as he-ee
But me-ee
I love you more.

(BABE: Tell me!)

And there once was a man who loved a woman
She was the one he gave his kingdom for
They say that nobody ever loved as much as he-ee
But me-ee
I love you more
--- Unknown ---
My love is a giant, fierce and defiant
But how can I prove it to you?
Ain't got no kingdom or dragon
To back up my braggin'
How can I show what I would do?
--- Unknown ---
I only know there once was a man
Who loved a woman
She was the one he ate the apple for
They say that nobody ever loved as much as he-ee
But me-ee, I love you more
--- Unknown ---
BABE:There once was a woman who loved a man
He was the one that she took poison for
They say that nobody ever loved as much as she-ee
But me-ee, I love you more
--- Unknown ---
And there once was a woman who loved a man,
He was the one she swam the channel for
They say that nobody ever loved as much as she-ee
But me-ee, I love you more.
--- Unknown ---
My love's meteoric, it's merely historic
A whirlwind, a cyclone on wheels
It rocks my whole solar plexus,
It's bigger than Texas
I just can't tell you how it feels
I only know there once was a woman
Who loved a man
Loved him enough to cause the Trojan War
They say that nobody ever loved as much as she-ee
But me-ee,
I love you more! more! more! more!
--- Unknown ---
More than a hangman loves his rope
More than a dopefiend loves his dope
More than an Injun loves his scalps
More than a yodeler loves his alps
More More More more more!
