------ The Three of Us (Me, Myself and I) ------
--- Unknown ---
The three of us have fallen in love
Me myself and I
The three of us are fighting for your kisses
Me myself and I
And if we struggle to the death to gain your favor
Not one of us will ever give in
The three of us have fallen in love
And may the best man win
