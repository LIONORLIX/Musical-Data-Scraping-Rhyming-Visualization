------ Hey There (Reprise) ------
--- SID ---
--- Unknown ---
Better forget her,
Her with her nose in the air.
She has you dancing on a string,
Break it and she won't care.
Will you take this advice I hand you like a brother,
Or are you not seeing things too clear?
Are you too much in love to hear.
