------ How I Feel ------
--- Unknown ---
Hard to tell you how I feel
Everything is so unreal
Lord, this life is a hard thing to get to
--- Unknown ---
Saw my shadow on the wall
Saw my love nowhere at all
Saw my life as a hard thing to get through
--- Unknown ---
When you're born, they carry you
When you're gone, they bury you
In between, you're on your own
Hard to stand there
All alone
--- Unknown ---
Someone crying down the hall
Dying cries, they tell it all
Lord, this life is a hard thing to live
And harder, still,
