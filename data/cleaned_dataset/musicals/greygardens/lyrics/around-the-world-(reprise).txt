------ Around the World (reprise) ------
--- Unknown ---
Around the world beyond the wall
Before the haze rolls in
Above the trees into the clear
Up where the clouds grow thin
Across the sea glistening with gold
Ill take the wind and sole
Your almost there your out the door
Its not to late a few steps more
Around the world new worlds await
Just flip the lach and though the gate
Go thought the gate the gardens gate
My mothers gate.
