------ Marry Well ------
--- Unknown ---
[Major Bouvier] (spoken)
Forgive me, ladies, but we live in perilous times.
If you want to anchor your self in a uncertain world you have only one recourse:
--- Unknown ---
(sung)
With your eye on the ball and your feet on the fairway-
Hit it high little girls, marry well!
--- Unknown ---
(man)
Four!
--- Major Bouvier ---
Every point under par is a leg up the stairway
to the sky little girls, marry well.
Find a staunch young patrician,
Republican!
With the blood and the brains to excel!
Like the fine strapping lad your late grandma ma had
meaning I, little girls, marry well.
--- Unknown ---
Ridiculous woman my daughter Edith
Flying at the face of every good solid value I ever tried to instill in her
God knows I've tried to teach her tried to teach all of my brood-
--- Unknown ---
[Edie & Major Bouvier](spoken)
The hallmark of aristocracy is responsibility
--- Major Bouvier ---
Edie, oh ho ho, the last hope of the great Bouvier clan.
--- Edie ---
Oh, honestly!
--- Brooks ---
But Major Bouvier, the time!
--- Major Bouvier ---
Oh alright, alright, I'm coming.

When in doubt, little girls, marry well!
--- Lee ---

--- Jackie ---

--- All ---
And the crowd will fall under your spell!
--- Major Bouvier ---
But an unmarried lassie who's fast and loose,
is a moose in a herd of gazelle!
--- All ---
POW
--- Major Bouvier ---
Don't be picked off the pack
with your head on a plaque!
Do me proud, little girls
--- All ---
Marry well
--- Major Bouvier ---
Its your future that counts
they say greatness always skips a generation
So now its up to you to burnish the family crest
and remember girls- this crest of our french royal providence
it took a while for it
we paid a pile for it
so go end up spinsters and diletants!
The name Bouvier will surpass all others
all of your uncles, aunts-
--- Edith ---
Oh Ah Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh
--- Major Bouvier ---
and mothers
--- Lee ---
Picture Lee in Milan with a prince and a villa.
--- Major Bouvier ---
Sally forth, little girl! Very nice.
--- Jackie ---
Jackie B. in Paris, simply bathes in chinchilla
--- Edie ---
As for me, Joe will more than suffice!
--- Major Bouvier ---
Good girl!
With a grandfather's blessing, I wish you love!
Someone there when your hair goes to gray, and I'll strut in my spats down the isle of Saint Pat's!
--- Brooks ---
Marry high!
--- Edie ---
Marry proud!
--- Jackie and Lee ---
Nouveau riche ain't allowed!
--- Brooks ---

--- Lee ---

--- Jackie ---

--- Brooks ---

--- Major Bouvier ---
Or if not, then in haste-

Marry well, and you're well on your way!
