------ Goin' Places ------
--- Joe ---
Me and the old man mapped it out
Fastest route to the Senate floor
Youngest man to be senator elect
--- Edie ---
How so?
--- Joe ---
The usual way...
--- Unknown ---
Pick up some medals overseas
Kick the butts of those SOBs
Zip back home,
Get married and gain respect
--- Unknown ---
I'll fly back here to Easthampton, scoop you right up into the cockpit.
--- Edie ---
My hair!
--- Joe ---
Kid, we're goin' places
Goin' places you never dreamed you'd see
As your social graces give some panache to me
--- Edie ---
I'll do my best.
--- Joe ---
With your pensive smile
And fairer style
That debonaire joie de vivre
--- Unknown ---
Kid, we're goin' places your mama won't believe
--- Edie ---
You know the trouble with the White House, Joe?
--- Joe ---
Un-uh.
--- Edie ---
It could use a little color.
--- Unknown ---
Picture the White House I'd restore
Not to criticize Eleanor
Home decor just isn't her stock in trade
--- Joe ---
You dress up any room just by being in it.
--- Edie ---
And as a former Waldorf deb,
I'll make fashion my cause celeb
Call it my American style crusade!
--- Unknown ---
Remember Joe, it's not what you wear...
--- Joe ---
No, no, no.
--- Edie ---
It's how you wear it.
--- Both ---
Kid, we're goin' places
Goin' places we never dreamed we'd get
--- Joe ---
As our love's embraces fill up the basinet
--- Edie ---
Slow down! Not yet.
--- Unknown ---
With your Colgate grin,
Dick Tracy chin
That Hollywood film star sheen
--- Both ---
Kid, we're goin' places
The nation's never seen
--- Unknown ---
New worlds await
Beyond the garden gate
--- Joe ---
As long as we've each other
--- Edie ---
Long as I escape my mother
--- Joe ---
Your mother? Well, shouldn't I be the one who matters most?
--- Edie ---
But you are. Of course you are.
--- Joe ---
The way you talk, a fella could forget.
--- Edie ---
You're the only one on my dance card.
--- Both ---
Oh, the signs are good
So knock on wood
We're gonna be A-OK
--- Unknown ---
'Cause the place we're goin'
We're goin' all the way
We're goin' all the way
--- Joe ---
We're goin' all the way
We're goin' all the way!
