------ Entering Grey Gardens ------
--- Unknown ---
(Male Chorus Lead)
When hedges hide the world away
--- Unknown ---
(Edith - spoken)
Edie?
--- Unknown ---
(Male Chorus Lead)
And shadows blur the time of day
--- Unknown ---
(Edith - spoken)
Edie!
--- Unknown ---
(Edie - spoken)
I'm feeding the cats!
--- Unknown ---
(Male Chorus Lead)
When cans of cat food are pat?
--- Unknown ---
(Chorus)
You're entering Grey Gardens
--- Unknown ---
(Edith)
Liver pat??  You have to make it.  I can't make it.
--- Unknown ---
(Edie)
When am I gonna get out of here?
--- Unknown ---
(Female Chorus Member)
The musty smell of feline fur
--- Unknown ---
(Male Chorus Member)
The dusty marks where pictures were
--- Unknown ---
(Female Chorus)
The vermin in the furniture
--- Unknown ---
(Chorus)
You're entering Grey Gardens
--- Unknown ---
(Edith - spoken)
Edie!
--- Unknown ---
(Male Chorus Member)
The ceiling sags, the stairway creaks
The faucet drips, the toilet leaks
The crumbling walls, the broken clocks
--- Unknown ---
(Chorus)
It's like a twenty-eight room litterbox
--- Unknown ---
(Male Chorus Member)
One-hundred-fifty windowsills
To catch a wink or two
--- Unknown ---
(Chorus)
And that's Grey Gardens from a cats eye view
--- Unknown ---
(Edith - spoken)
I'll die if I don't eat!
--- Unknown ---
(Male Chorus Member - spoken)

(Edie - spoken)
I found your pat?, Mother darling

(Male Chorus Member - spoken)
Meow
--- Unknown ---
(Edie - spoken)
I think it's pat?, the label, it's faded
Is it pat?, or is it giblets for the cats?
--- Unknown ---
(Male Chorus Member - spoken)
Meow

(Male Chorus Member - spoken)

(Chorus Members - spoken)
Meow

(Chorus)
The fog rolls in, and there it stays
It suffocates the house in haze
From room to room, it drifts about
And nobody except a cat gets out
--- Unknown ---
(Male Chorus Member)
A haven from a callous world
With no one saying shoo
--- Unknown ---
(Chorus)
And that's Grey Gardens from a cat's eye view
--- Unknown ---
(Edie - spoken)
I may die with this diet.  I don't like it at all
--- Unknown ---
(Male Chorus Member - spoken)
Meow
--- Unknown ---
(Edith - spoken)
Ever since you started trying to lose weight, you've been impossible
--- Unknown ---
(Chorus Members - spoken)
Meow
--- Unknown ---
(Edie - spoken)
I'm not gaining it back
--- Unknown ---
(Male Chorus Member - spoken)
Meow
--- Unknown ---
(Edith - spoken)
Starve yourself, not me!
--- Unknown ---
(Male Chorus Members - spoken)
Meow
--- Unknown ---
(Edie - spoken)
Here's your pat?, Mother Darling
