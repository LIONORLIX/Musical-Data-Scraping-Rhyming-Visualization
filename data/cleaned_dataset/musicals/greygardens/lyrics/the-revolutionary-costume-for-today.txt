------ The Revolutionary Costume for Today ------
--- Unknown ---
(Speaking)
Oh, hi. Thank heaven you're here.
You look absolutely terrific, honestly.
--- Unknown ---
(Singing)
The best kind of clothes for a protest pose
Is this ensemble of pantyhose
Pulled over the shorts, worn under the skirt
That doubles as a cape.
--- Unknown ---
To reveal you in capri pants
You fashion out of ski pants,
In a jersey knit designed to fit
The contour of your shape.
Then cinch it with a cord from the drape.
--- Unknown ---
And that's the revolutionary costume for today.
To show the polo riders, in khakis and topsiders,
Just what a revolutionary costume has to say.
It can't be ordered from L.L. Bean.
There's more to living than kelly green.
And that's the revolution, I mean.

Da da da da dum...

Just listen to this: The Hamptons Bee, July, 1972:
The elderly bed-ridden aunt of former First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy,
Mrs. Edith Bouvier Beale...
--- Unknown ---
My very own mother, can you imagine?
--- Unknown ---
"...and her adult daughter, Miss Edie Beale,
a former debutante once known as Body Beautiful Beale...
--- Unknown ---
They called me Body Beautiul Beale, it's true -
that was my whaddyacallit, my uh ... sobriquet.
--- Unknown ---
"...are living on Long Island in a garbage-ridden, filthy 28-room house with 52 cats,
fleas, cobwebs, and virtually no plumbing.
After vociferous complaints from neighbors,
the Board of Health took legal action against the reclusive pair.
--- Unknown ---
Why, it's the most disgusting, atrocious thing ever to happen in America!
--- Unknown ---
(Singing)
You fight City Hall with a Persian shawl
That used to hang on the bedroom wall,
Pinned under the chin, adorned with a pin
And pulled into a twist.
--- Unknown ---
Reinvent the objet trouve,
Make a poncho from a duvet,
Then you can be with cousin Lee
On Mr. Blackwell's list.
The full-length velvet glove hides the fist.
--- Unknown ---
And that's the revolutionary costume for today.
Subvert the CrisCraft boaters, those Nixon-Agnew voters.
Armies of conformity are headed right your way.
To make a statement you need not be
In Boston Harbor upending tea.
And that's a Revolution, to me.
--- Unknown ---
Staunch!
There's nothin' worse, I tell ya,
Staunch!
S-T-A-U-N-C-H.
Staunch women, we just don't weaken.
A little known fact to the fascist pack
Who comes here for antiquin'.

Honestly, they can get you in East Hampton for wearing red shoes on a Thursday ?
and all that sort of thing.
I don't know whether you know that ? I mean, do you know that?
They can get you for almost anything ? it's a mean, nasty, Republican town.
--- Unknown ---
(Singing)
The best kind of shoes to express bold views
Are strapless mules in assertive hues
Like fuscia or peach, except on the beach,
In which case you wear flats.
--- Unknown ---
When I stood before the nation
At Jack's inauguration,
In a high-heeled pump, I got the jump
on Jackie's pillbox hat.
Just watch it where you step with the cat!
--- Unknown ---
And that's the revolutionary costume pour du jour.
You mix 'n' match and, Presto!
A fashion manifesto.
That's why a revolutionary costume's de rigeur.
The rhododendrons are hiding spies,
The pussy willows have beady eyes.
Binoculars through the privet hedge,
They peek at you through the window ledge with guile!
--- Unknown ---
We're in a Revolution!
So win the Revolution with style!
