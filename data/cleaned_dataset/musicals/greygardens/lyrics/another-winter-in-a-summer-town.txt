------ Another Winter in a Summer Town ------
--- Unknown ---
Another winter
The renters go home
The maple goes from crimson to brown
Oh God, my God
Another winter
In a summer town
The beach is empty
They covered the pools
The patio umbrellas come down
Oh God, my God
Another winter
In a summer town
--- Unknown ---
One little leaf adrift in the breeze
Refuses to fall from the sky
Blown by the wind
It clings to the tree
Unwilling to wither and die
The summers over
But I'm still a girl
Covorting in my carnival crown
From blossom to blossom
I buzz like a bee
Then glance in the mirror
And who do I see
A middle-aged woamn inhabiting me
Because it's winter
In a summer town
--- Unknown ---
Yesterday's dreams - a faded bouquet
Roses that died on the vine
Yesterday seems more real than today
It's difficult drawing the line
My season ended
A long time ago
But no one took the party tent down
The pink paper lanterns still twinkle in place
My young navy hero
His tender embrace
That sapphire blue ocean
Oh, how can I face
Another winter
In a summer town
Oh God, oh God
My God
