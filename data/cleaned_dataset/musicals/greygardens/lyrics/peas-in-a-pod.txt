It's the very first song you ever taught me. We used to sing it together.

(sung)
Given our amazing similarities
We could be a plate of eggs and ham.
A pair of canaries,
I shadow you like Mary's lamb
--- Unknown ---
[Edith](spoken)
I'm sorry, I'm in no mood-
--- Unknown ---
[Edie](spoken)
For me, Mother, please? I'll sing the man's part.
--- Unknown ---
(sung)
Physically, a few discreet disparities
Ought to keep us happy as...
Happy as...
--- Edith ---
...As a clam
--- Edie ---
Why fight it, lady?
Our star is in ascendance!
Make me your matey-
--- Edith & Edie ---
And I'll give you my independence

[Gould](spoken)
Well, come on, Edith, don't tell me you forgot the staging.
--- Unknown ---
[Edith](spoken)
I didn't forget it, I just don't want to do it.
--- Unknown ---
[Gould](spoken)
Just do it and for God's sake, smile.
--- Edie ---
We're a bowl of peaches and cream.

The Dodgers and Brooklyn
--- Edie ---
A permanent team.

India and Gandhi

Dagwood and his Blondie.
--- Edith & Edie ---
Two peas in a pod

We're an act like Crosby and Hope.

A rosy complexion and Ivory Soap.
--- Edie ---
Pip and Miss Estella
--- Edith ---
Hedda and Louella
--- Edith & Edie ---
Two peas in a pod.
We stick together
Like a cushion and pins.
--- Edie ---
Birds of a feather
--- Edith ---
I'd say Siamese twins.
--- Edith & Edie ---
Ever-aftering where
We will build a cozy retreat
Which no nosy neighbors
Can see from the street.
--- Edie ---
What need we Manhattan?
--- Edith ---
Just us and a cat in-
--- Edith & Edie ---
A cottage on Cape Cod
For two, please - two peas in a pod.
--- Unknown ---
[Gould](spoken)
Oh come on, Edith. Dance! A soft shoe! How can you resist?
--- Unknown ---
[Edith](spoken)
I can't help myself! It's the music and I'm its hapless victim!
--- Unknown ---
[Gould](spoken)
Aren't we all, kid, aren't we all?
--- Edith & Edie ---
If by our devotion
Nature gets the notion
To send a gift from God,
Send two please.
--- Edie ---
Say kootchie-koo.
--- Edith & Edie ---
Cuties-
--- Edith ---
-In pink and blue.
--- Edith & Edie ---
Two, please - two peas in a pod.
Two peas in a pod.
