------ Will You? ------
--- Unknown ---
When lilacs return in spring,
Will you?
When larks in the meadows sing,
Will you?
When clouds of a summer storm dissolve,
And starlight shimmers through,
Will you?
--- Unknown ---
When wild geese of autumn fly,
Will you?
When hearth fires of winter die,
Will you?
Time rushes by,
Memories fade,
Dreams never do.
I will be ever true,
Will you?
--- Unknown ---
When wild geese of autumn fly,
Will you?
As I lay there wondering why,
Will you?
Time rushes by,
Memories fade,
Dreams never do.
I will be ever true,
Will you?
