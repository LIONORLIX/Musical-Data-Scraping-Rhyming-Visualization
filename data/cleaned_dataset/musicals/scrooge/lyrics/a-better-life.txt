------ A Better Life ------
--- Unknown ---
Scrooge
Do my eyes deceive me
Can my reason lie
Am I living here and now
Or in some life gone by
Is this world I'm seeing
The world I saw before
Could there be a better life
That might have taught me more
--- Unknown ---
Am I merely dreaming
Or am I awake
Is my mind just playing games
Or showing me a pathway I should take
--- Unknown ---
Do I just ignore it
Do I break the spell
Or do I take another look
Open up a brand new book
Try to find a better life
A bigger, brighter, better life
And could I somehow learn to live it well
Only time will tell
Can I find a better life
