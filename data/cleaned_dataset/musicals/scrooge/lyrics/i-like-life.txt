------ I Like Life ------
--- Ghost of Christmas Present ---
Ebenezer Scrooge
The sins of man are huge
A neverending symphony
Of villainy and infamy
Duplicity, deceit, and subtefuge
And no one's worse than Ebenezer Scrooge
Though man's a handy candidate for Hell
I must admit life sometimes has it's brighter side as well
--- Unknown ---
I like life
Life likes me
Life and I fairly fully agree
Life is fine
Life is good
'Specially mine, which is just as it should be
I like pouring the wine and why not?
Life's a pleasure that I deny not
--- Unknown ---
I like life
Here and now
Life and I made a mutual vow
'Till I die
Life and I
We'll both try to be better somehow
And if life were a woman
She would be my wife
--- Unknown ---
Scrooge

And during your long, miserable, miserly, selfish existence
You haven't even learned how to live
Now listen to me

Come on, Scrooge, we're going visiting
You're in for a few surprises
--- Unknown ---
Drinking life
That's the thing
Makes a man want to suddenly sing
Sing and dance
And perchance
Seeing life from a different stance
When you learn how to live it
Life is free of strife
That is why I like life!
--- Unknown ---
That's the secret of living
--- Unknown ---
Scrooge
Any man can fly!
