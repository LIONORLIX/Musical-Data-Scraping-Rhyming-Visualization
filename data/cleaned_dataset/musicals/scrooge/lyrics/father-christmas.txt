Father Christmas
Father Christmas
He's the meanest man in the whole wide world
In the whole wide world
You can feel it
--- Unknown ---
He's a miser
He's a skinflint
He's a stingy lout
Leave your stocking out
For your Christmas gift and he'll steal it
--- Unknown ---
It's a shame
He's a villain
What a game
For a villain to play
On Christmas day
--- Unknown ---
After Christmas
Father Christmas
Will be just as mean as he's ever been
And I'm here to say
We should all send Father Christmas
