Ladies and gentlemen
On behalf of all the people who have assembled here
I would merely like to mention if I may
That our unanimous attitude
Is one of lasting gratitude
For what our friend has done for us today
And therefore I would simply like to say
--- Unknown ---
Thank you very much!
Thank you very much!
That's the nicest thing that anyone's ever done for me
I may sound Double-Dutch
But my delight is such
I feel as if a losing war's been won for me
And if I had a flag I'd hang my flag out
To add a sort of final victory touch
But since I left my flag at home
I'll simply have to say
Thank you very, very, very much!
--- Unknown ---
Company
Thank you very, very, very much!

Thank you very much!
Thank you very much!
That's the nicest thing that anyone's ever done for me
It sounds a bit bizarre
But things the way they are
I feel as if another life's begun for me
--- Unknown ---
Company
And if I had a cannon I would fire it
To add a sort of celebration touch
But since I left my cannon at home
I'll simply have to say

Scrooge
Thank you very, very, very much!

Company
Thank you very, very, very much!

Thank you very much!
Thank you very much!
That's the nicest thing that anyone's ever done for me
It isn't everyday
Good fortune comes my way
I never thought the future would be fun for me
And if I had a bugle I would blow it
To add a sort of 'ow's-your-father touch
But since I left my bugle at home
I'll simply have to say
Thank you very, very, very much

Scrooge
No, my friends, it is I who should be thankful to you!

Thank you very, very much
Thank you very, very much
Thank you very much
Thank you very much
Thank you very much
Thank you very much
Thank you very, very, very, very much

And if I had a drum I'd have to bang it!
To add a sort of rumty-tumty touch
But since I left my drum at home
I'll simply have to say
Thank you very, very, very much!
