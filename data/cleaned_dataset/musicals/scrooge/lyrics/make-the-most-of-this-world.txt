------ Make the Most of this World ------
--- Unknown ---
Marley
See the phantoms filling the sky around you
They astound you I can tell
These inhabitants of hell
Poor wretches whom the hand of heaven ignores
Beware
Beware
Beware
Lest their dreadful fate be yours
--- Unknown ---
Make the most of this world
For the next world is worse
If you think life is miserable now
That the life to come is better somehow
You had better put your thinking in reverse
And make the most of this world
For the next world is far, far worse
--- Unknown ---
Phantoms
Make the most of this life
The next life's a curse
The man who kicks the present aside
In a quest for things life doesn't provide
Had better know now his theory is perverse
Make the most of this life
--- Unknown ---
Marley
For the next life is far, far worse
Let's talk about heaven a minute
Men dream of it from birth
Heaven, you idiot
You're in it on earth
--- Unknown ---
Phantoms
Make the most of living
For dying is worse
At times you'll say life isn't worthwile
But there's more to life than travelling in style
--- Unknown ---
Marley
It's better to walk than ride inside a hearse
--- Unknown ---
Marley and Phantoms
So make the most of this world
Embrace the universe
--- Unknown ---
Marley
For I guarantee that the next world
