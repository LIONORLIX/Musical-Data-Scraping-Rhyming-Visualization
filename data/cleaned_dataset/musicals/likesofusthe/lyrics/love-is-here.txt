I aint got no gifts to bring

No pearls for you to wear

(Jenny)

(Johnny)
I don't have no shinning moon
we're bloody miles from june
but you know love is here.

All them poets with their rhyme
their pretty words in time
are missing whats so clear

It dos'nt mean a thing to me

(Johnny)
Painters they have missed it to
writters havent got a clue
they cant see love is here
--- Unknown ---
I could look forever
and i know id never
find a better way to say
things i feel so plainly
and what matters mainly is
i got you here today
--- Unknown ---
You wont get sweet words from me
no pretty poetry
to whisper is your ear
kings and queens are just like me
but they got finery
my darlin love is here
