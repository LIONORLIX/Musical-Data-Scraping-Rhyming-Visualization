------ Strange and Lovely Song ------
--- Unknown ---
It's easy to be careless let a lifetime hurry by
Live aimlessly forever and be nothing til you die
I would have let that happen, but suddenly I found
My little world invaded by a strange and lovely sound
--- Unknown ---
Softly through the rush and roar of day
When the still of night draws near
From the depths of somewhere far away
A strange and lovely song I hear
--- Unknown ---
Tumblin' shapes and clouds of melody
Spin my troubles through the air
Steal the key and find the harmony
Of a strange and lovely song so rare
--- Unknown ---
Before all my dreams were a pattern
Fading colors of grey and brown and blue
But these patterns are changing to pictures
And I feel like I am changing too
--- Unknown ---
Though I wander through a haunting haze
Touched by sounds I cannot see
I shall someday understand who plays
Such a strange and lovely song to me
--- Unknown ---
But these patterns are changing to pictures
And I feel like I am changing too
--- Unknown ---
Though I wander through a haunting haze
Touched by sounds I cannot see
I shall oneday understand who plays
