Hey, syd,
I think i might have found my place, syd.
People recognize my face, syd.
All around the town they ask me:
aren't you in that movie?
It's really quite amazing.
I think now my life is changing.
One day, my future was unseen.
Then the next day, my name's up on a screen.
And hey, syd, i think i finally found my home.
