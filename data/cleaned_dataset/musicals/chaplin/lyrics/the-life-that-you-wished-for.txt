------ The Life That You Wished For ------
--- Unknown ---
Charlie
Mum, they stop him on the street,
And they have him sign his name.
And then they take his picture,
So the moment can remain.
And he is wonderful.
Oh, yes, how wonderful he feels.
'Cause the life that he wished for became real.
Now the money's rolling in
And he's dressed in fancy clothes,
And he lives inside a mansion,
And his face the whole world knows.
And he is wonderful.
Oh, yes, how wonderful he feels.
'Cause the life that he wished for became real.
--- Unknown ---
But sometimes when he signs his name,
They quickly walk away.
He knows they're trying to be polite,
But he wishes they would stay.
I need for you to hear me,
And recognize my face.
I wish that i could save you
From that dark and lonely place.
And that would be wonderful,

Charlie (condâ€™t)
Oh, yes, how wonderful that would feel,
If the dreams that you wanted to see
Turned out the way you hoped they would be,
And the life that you wished for
Became real.
