Charlie
Look at all the people,
And see into their eyes.
Try to find the story
Behind each one's disguise.

Hannah
Wonder where they've come from,
And the people they have known
Once you find the story
Then you just make it your own.
Come along charlie. Try to be happy, give mum a smile.
Oh, look at this poor fellow.
Charlie
I see him, mum.
Hannah
Look at them two. So uppity.
Charlie & young charlie
I see them!

Hannah
And look at this sorry bloke. Drunk as a lord.
