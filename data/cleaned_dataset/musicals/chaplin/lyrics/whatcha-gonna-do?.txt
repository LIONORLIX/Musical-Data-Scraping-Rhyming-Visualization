You've got a great big house
On top of easy street.
You've got a million quid,
A life that can't be beat.
But you look down on folk,
You're such a mean old bloke . . .

When you're knocked off your feet.

Then, what'cha gonna do when it all falls down,
And where you gonna go from there?
What'cha gonna do when the money's gone
And who you gonna buy to care?
What'cha gonna do when the landlord says
now get yourself outta here?
What'cha gonna paint
When you cannot paint the town?
Remember what'cha give is what always goes around!
And what'cha gonna do when it all falls down?

What'cha gonna do when it all falls down,
And where you gonna go from there?
What'cha gonna do when the money's gone,
And who you gonna buy to care?
What'cha gonna do when the landlord says
now get yourself outta here?
