------ Ian's Here ------
--- Ian ---
Smell the incense in the air
The cabbage and mulled wine
Throw away all worldly cares
Tonight is yours and mine
--- Unknown ---
Though I haven't known you long
In the present paradigm
In our past lives we've connected
You and I throughout all time.
--- Unknown ---
Maybe you were Desdemona
And I your Black Marauder
Maybe you were Helen Keller
And I was the water!
--- Unknown ---
Ian's here
To offer a safe haven
Where you can be yourself
Unshackled and unshaven.
You will find no judgment here
And no talk of wrong or right
Just a beacon in the harbor
A gentle guiding light.
--- Unknown ---
So close your eyes
Is that land you're seein'?
Yes it is--and on that land is Ian.
--- Unknown ---
(over a ringing cell phone)
Ian's here
Ian's here
Have no fear
Ian's--shit!
--- Unknown ---
Laura: (re: phone)
I am so sorry. Oh, it's Rob again. I should maybe--
--- Ian ---
Oh, Laura. You've pulled the pin, now be brave enough to toss the grenade.
--- Laura ---
The grenade?
--- Ian ---
Sometimes a relationship needs to be blown up so that we can see what's left over.
--- Laura ---
Huh. Where did you learn al this?
--- Ian ---
My methods are partly European,
Partly Easterbn,
But mostly just pure Ian!
--- Ian & Laura ---
Ian's here.
--- Ian ---

--- Ian ---

Mee nee meet me in the kitchen wit da sari on!
--- Unknown ---
Mi nee som de dom mi nee ha ree dom
