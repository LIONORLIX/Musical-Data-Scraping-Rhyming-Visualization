------ Turn The World Off (And Turn You On) ------
--- Unknown ---
Got to pull it up
Got to pull it out
Got to survive
Got to stay calm
Got to think fast
Don't want to burn
Searching for a door
Searching for a way
Out of this thing
I don't know what's wrong
Don't know what to do
Im out of control
Nothing I can do
Nothing seems to work
Im barely alive
Got to slow it down
Got to do something
Or give in
Watching us fall
Trying everything
Fighting for life
Running out of time
I don't have a choice
Im riding it in
--- Unknown ---
Im inside and Im trying to get out
Im inside and Im screaming for some help
And everythings gone wrong
Im listening to the sound of my own fear
Im listening to the sound of someones tears
Im listening to me
--- Unknown ---
This is the fear
This is nothing like
You could believe
Panic in my heart
Like a cold hand
Pulling at strings
Ill do anything
Even pray to god
Just let me out
Turn off the machine
Turn off all the noise
Turn off the world

Im inside and Im trying to get out

Im listening to me

You learn fast when everything breaks down
You learn fast when that's all that you can do
