------ She Goes ------
--- Unknown ---
No offense, but you were lucky to get her.
I like you both the same--
Well, her a bit better.
Your macho act can't hide the fact you adore her.
Now she's gone like all the others before her.
15-20--that's a few!
This shit is old--and so are you!
--- Unknown ---
I relied on your success to direct me.
Did you ever once think how this would affect me?
I'm a wreck and what the heck will you do now?
Go to Scores and tip a stripper or two now?
I don't know how it works today
But for you it only works one way!
--- Unknown ---
You meet someone, you move in together, she goes!
You meet someone, you move in together, she goes!
The girls may change in face and name,
But one thing always stays the same.
As sure as a baby cries and the river flows,
She goes!

Liz: (with backup boys)
Rob I'm talking to you as a friend now
I could say that it's not you,
But why pretend now?
You know you shouldn't feel
The slightest compunction
If you suffer from some
Down-below-there dysfunction.
--- Rob ---
It's been really hard on me,
so have a little sympathy!

Liz: (with backup boys)
You meet someone, you move in together, she goes!
Repeat this son: you move in together, she goes!
It may start out butterflies and bows
But once the blush is off the rose
And the girl fin'lly figures out
That you'll never propose
She goes!
--- Unknown ---
I've stood by with all the others
Smiled away like Sally Struthers
Patient and supportive.
Now you finally got a winnder.
Did you even cook her dinner?
The answer's 'No' I'm guessin'!
And I'm full on PMS'in!
--- Backup Boys ---
She's full on PMS'in!

Liz:(with backup boys)
You meet someone, you move in together, she goes!
Repeat this hon: you move in together, she goes!
I can't fault you for consistency,
Heaven knows!
--- Unknown ---
Now please don't take this as mean-hearted,
But are you on crack or just retarded?
--- Unknown ---
Cause you meet someone--
You move in together!
A sweet someone,
And light as a feather!
Mistreat someone and
Change like the weather!
