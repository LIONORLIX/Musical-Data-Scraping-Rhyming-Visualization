------ Cryin' In The Rain ------
--- Rob ---
Laura!
Answer the phone.
Answer the phone!
For fuck's sake won't you
Answer the fucking phone!
--- Laura ---
Hello?
--- Rob ---
Oh, hi. It's me. Rob.
--- Laura ---
Rob, where are you?
--- Rob ---
Laura, listen, I just want to say--
--- Laura ---
Actually, I can't really talk right now--
--- Rob ---
No--no--wait--no!
I think you're running!
You're running scared, little girl!
From the sharp point each
Relationship hits
So you feel the need to blow it to bits
But soon, you're gonna wake and see
--- Unknown ---
You can run, little child,
But you'll never be free!
No you'll never be free...no no no!
Have your fun, little child
Don't you worry 'bout me!
--- Unknown ---
Oh God!
Don't leave me
--- Rob and exes ---
Cryin' in the rain!
I'm always cryin' in the rain!
God I hate cryin' in the rain!
--- Rob ---
I see you through the window
Looking so drawn and pale
Oh how can you stand to be manhandled
By that Steven Segal ponytail?
--- Rob and exes ---
You needed to experiment
And dickhead fit the bill
But he doesn't love you
And he'll never understand you
Like I will, like I will!
--- Rob ---
You can run, little child
But you'll never be free!
No you'll never be free
No no no!
--- Unknown ---
Have your fun, little child--
Don't you worry 'bout me!
Don't you worry 'bout me
No, no, no!
--- Unknown ---
Hello? Hello?
--- Unknown ---
Laura!
--- Rob with exes ---
Don't leave me cryin' in the rain!
I'm always cryin' in the rain!
God I hate cryin' in the rain!
