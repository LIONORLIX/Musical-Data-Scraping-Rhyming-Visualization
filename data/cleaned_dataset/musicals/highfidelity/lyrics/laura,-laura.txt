------ Laura, Laura ------
--- Unknown ---
I made a list of everything
That's gone on between you and me
And even an idiot like me could see
--- Unknown ---
No matter how you add it up
When you reach the bottom line
The fault was usually mine.
--- Unknown ---
The stupid things I've said and done
If I could change just even one
the thing I'd say would be:
Laura, Laura...I'm so sorry.
--- Unknown ---
It's become my trade in stock
To always jump fron rock to rock
Chasing fantasies that don't come through.
--- Unknown ---
Thought I was happy just to coast
But it's me who needed you the most.
Of course that's something
I could never own up to.
--- Unknown ---
I want to look you in the face to say
What I never had the grace to say
When you were still with me:
Laura, Laura...I'm so sorry.
--- Unknown ---
For everything you're going through
And everything I can't undo,
Please accept this small apology
--- Unknown ---
Oh, Laura, Laura,
Sweet, sweet Laura
Laura, Laura...
--- Unknown ---
For letting you down...
For letting you go...
