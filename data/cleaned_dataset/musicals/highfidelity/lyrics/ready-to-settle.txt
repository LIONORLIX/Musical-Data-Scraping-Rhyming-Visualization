------ Ready To Settle ------
--- Marie ---
--- Unknown ---
Grabbed the moon
Full of hope
Fell to earth
Without rope
Heart as heavy as a stone
--- Unknown ---
Been betrayed
Been abused
Spirit flayed
And ego bruised
Ev'rybody dies alone.
--- Unknown ---
I always knew before he flew
He was too good for me
Now I'm here with you
How more different could you be?
--- Unknown ---
You're just like me
Alone and sad
And in this light
You don't look so bad.
--- Unknown ---
I've had the best
Now I need a rest
Just someone who'll do
And I'm ready to settle for you.
--- Unknown ---
This feel like a cancer grows
Feel the rot between my toes.
--- Marie & Backup Singer ---
Why take another breath?
--- Unknown ---
For now I see
That all life brings
Is a string of disappointing things.
And in the end--cold death.
--- Unknown ---
We're both aware this love we share
Can't even fill a room
And so we talk too loud
To drown out the desperate gloom!
--- Marie ---
My heart is dead
--- Backup Singer ---
Heart is dead
--- Marie ---
A hollow bone
--- Backup Singer ---
Hollow bone
--- Marie ---
I'm filled with dread
--- Both ---
I'll end up alone!
--- Marie ---
I'll move in my stuff
Act like it's enough
--- Unknown ---
I'm past thirty-two
--- Backup Singer ---
Past thirty-two
--- Marie ---
And I'm ready
--- Both ---
To settle for you.
--- Marie ---
See the happy people laughing
They're all deaf and blind!
--- Backup Singer ---
Blind and deaf.
--- Marie ---
Why should we go on searching
For something we won't find?
--- Backup Singer ---
There's no hope.
--- Marie ---
Why should we pretend
We're happy too?
--- Backup Singer ---
You know we're not.
--- Both ---
I'd rather just stay home
And sulk with you!
--- Unknown ---
You're just like me
Alone and sad
And in the dark
You don't look so bad
--- Marie ---
It's nice to know
That you'll never go
--- Unknown ---
Cause if not me, then who?
--- Backup Singer ---
If not me then who?
--- Marie ---
And I'm ready
--- Both ---
To settle
--- Marie ---
For you
--- Both ---
Ready to settle....
Ready to settle....
Ready to settle....
For you.
