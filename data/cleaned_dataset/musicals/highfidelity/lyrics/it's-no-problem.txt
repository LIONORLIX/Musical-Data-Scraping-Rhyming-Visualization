Look, Dick, Laura and I broke up.
So if you ever see Barry again maybe you can tell him that.
--- Dick ---
You want ME to tell Barry about it?
--- Rob ---
Yeah, would you?
--- Dick ---
Sure, of course.
--- Unknown ---
It's no problem.
No problem Rob--you're on.
I'll tell him when I see him next,
Rob says to tell you--Laura's gone.
My schedule's pretty open
So I've got some time today.
Plus I've got some other stuff
To tell him anyway.
--- Unknown ---
So I'll tell him when I tell him all the other stuff
Or--I could even call.
So it's no problem, no problem at all.
--- Rob ---
All right, Dick--
--- Dick ---
It's no problem.
I'll see him later at a gig.
I'll prob'ly start with your news first
Cause my news isn't big:
Just to tell him
That this woman's gonna sing.
So I'll bring it up before,
A good news/bad news kind of thing.
--- Unknown ---
I mean bad news/good news
Cause he thinks the singer's great.
Not that Laura isn't too--no!
What I meant to say--no wait!
--- Unknown ---
Barry really likes you both
He told me so last fall,
So it's no problem, it's no problem,
It's no problem, Rob
A-a-a-a-at--
--- Rob ---
GREAT, Dick. Glad you got it covered.
