------ Rookie In The Ring ------
--- Unknown ---
Belle: "Benjamin, I don't think you even make an effort to get to know your step father. Rookie is a very worldly person. And that's an attribute I think Alan Swan will appreciate."
--- Unknown ---
Benjy: "Ma, I just don't think that asking Alan Swan to dinner is such a good idea. I mean Swan is an aristocrat, a Prince of the blood."
--- Unknown ---
A Prince...? A Prince?
--- Unknown ---
What do you know from a prince or a king?
--- Unknown ---
You look at a person and you don't see a thing.
--- Unknown ---
You see fame or fortune, or God knows what!
--- Unknown ---
Well in this respect like your mother, you're not!
--- Unknown ---
Cause there happens to be a prince right in front of your nose
--- Unknown ---
And he happens to be the man I chose
--- Unknown ---
He isn't rich. He isn't tall. And he can barely speak American at all!
--- Unknown ---
But all I know is how my heart began to sing
--- Unknown ---
That night when I saw Rookie in the ring...
--- Unknown ---
He must've weighed, what? A half a pound...
--- Unknown ---
He didn't look like he could last a half a round
--- Unknown ---
But all I know is there was magic in his swing
--- Unknown ---
That night when I saw Rookie in the ri...ing!
--- Unknown ---
The way he hung on being his ecstatic jeered by some joker
--- Unknown ---
The punches he took someone less would be out like a light!
--- Unknown ---
The way he hung on! To the crowd started yelling--
--- Unknown ---
Carroca! Carroca! Carrrrroca!
--- Unknown ---
You might say... it was love at first-- fight *giggle*
--- Unknown ---
You see him cook. You seem him clean. You come to dinner for his tuna filipene!
--- Unknown ---
But if you ever could have seen him do his thing...
--- Unknown ---
You'd know despite that apron, he's still... the king
--- Unknown ---
And you'd see Rookie...
--- Unknown ---
Like I see Rookie...
