------ There's a Fine, Fine Line ------
--- Kate Monster ---
There's a fine, fine line between a lover and a friend;
There's a fine, fine line between reality and pretend;
And you never know 'til you reach the top if it was worth the uphill climb.
--- Unknown ---
There's a fine, fine line between love
And a waste of time.
--- Unknown ---
There's a fine, fine line between a fairy tale and a lie;
And there's a fine, fine line between You're wonderful and Goodbye.
I guess if someone doesn't love you back it isn't such a crime,
But there's a fine, fine line between love
And a waste of your time.
--- Unknown ---
And I don't have the time to waste on you anymore.
I don't think that you even know what you're looking for.
For my own sanity, I've got to close the door
And walk away...
Oh...
--- Unknown ---
There's a fine, fine line between together and not
And there's a fine, fine line between what you wanted and what you got.
You gotta go after the things you want while you're still in your prime...
--- Unknown ---
There's a fine, fine line between love
