------ There's A Fine, Fine Line (Reprise) ------
--- Kate Monster ---
The Monsterssori School...I don’t even know where to start!
--- Christmas Eve ---
Do you know who get idea and collect
All the money and buy building for you?
--- Kate Monster ---
Was it you?
--- Christmas Eve ---
No. It Princeton.
--- Kate Monster ---
Princeton? For me?
--- Princeton ---
You said you couldn’t make your dreams come
True by yourself, so I shot for the stars.
--- Unknown ---
You’ve gotta go after the things you want
While you’re still in your prime.
--- Kate Monster ---
There’s a fine, fine line
Between love...
--- Unknown ---
Thank you Princeton.
--- Princeton ---
So will you take me back, Kate?
--- Kate Monster ---
I’ll be so busy now, with all of the contractors
And inspections and hiring teachers and choosing textbooks...
--- Princeton ---
Well, I could help you.
