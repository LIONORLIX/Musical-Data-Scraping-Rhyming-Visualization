------ Special ------
--- LUCY ---
I can make you feel special
When it sucks to be you.
I can make you feel special
For an hour or two.
--- Unknown ---
Your life's a routine that repeats each day.
No one cares who you are or what you say.
And sometimes you feel like you're nobody,
But you can feel like somebody with me.
--- PRINCETON ---
Wow!
--- LUCY ---
Yeah, they're real.
--- Unknown ---
When we're together the earth will shake
And the stars will fall into the sea.
So come on, baby, let down your guard.
When your date's in the bathroom,
I'll slip you my card.
I can tell just by looking that you've got it hard
For me! For me!
For me! For me!
For me! For me!
