You keep doing what you're doing.

--- Gary Coleman ---
You're not allowed to be loud
At the library
At the art museum
Or at a play
But when you and your partner
Are doing the nasty
Don't behave like you're
At the ballet!
Cause you can be as loud as
The hell you want
When you're making love
--- Bad Idea Bears ---
Making sweet, sweet love

You can be as loud as
The hell you want

Loud as the hell!
Loud as the hell you want!
--- Gary Coleman ---
Don't let the neighbors
Stop you from havin' fun,
They'll have peace and quiet
When you?re good and done.
--- All ---
Be as loud as
The hell you want
When you?re making love!
Loud as the hell you want...

Smack it and lick it and rub it and suck it!
