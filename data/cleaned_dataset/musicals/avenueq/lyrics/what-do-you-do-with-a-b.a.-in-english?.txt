------ What Do You Do with a B.A. in English? ------

What do you do with a B.A. in English,
What is my life going to be?
Four years of college and plenty of knowledge,
Have earned me this useless degree.
--- Unknown ---
I can't pay the bills yet,
'Cause I have no skills yet,
The world is a big scary place.
--- Unknown ---
But somehow I can't shake,
The feeling I might make,
A difference,
To the human race.
--- Unknown ---
Morning, Brian.

Hi, Kate Monster.
--- Unknown ---
How's life?
--- Unknown ---
Disappointing.
--- Unknown ---
What's the matter?
