------ My Girlfriend, Who Lives in Canada ------
--- ROD ---
Ohhhh...
I wish you could meet my girlfriend, my girlfriend who lives in Canada.
She couldn't be sweeter
I wish you could meet her,
My girlfriend who lives in Canada!
--- Unknown ---
Her name is Alberta
She live in Vancouver
She cooks like my mother
And sucks like a Hoover.
--- Unknown ---
I e-mail her every single day
Just to make sure that everything's okay.
It's a pity she lives so far away, in Canada!
--- Unknown ---
Last week she was here, but she had the flu.
Too bad
'Cause I wanted to introduce her to you
It's so sad
There wasn't a thing that she could do
But stay in bed with her legs up over her head!
Oh!
--- Unknown ---
I wish you could meet my girlfriend,
But you can't because she is in Canada.
I love her, I miss her, I can't wait to kiss her,
So soon I'll be off to Alberta!
I mean Vancouver!
Shit! Her name is Alberta, she lives in Vancou-
--- Unknown ---
She's my girlfriend!
My wonderful girlfriend!
Yes I have a girlfriend, who lives in Canada!!
