------ It Sucks To Be Me ------
--- KATE MONSTER ---
Morning, Brian!
--- BRIAN ---
Hi, Kate Monster.
--- KATE MONSTER ---
How's life?
--- BRIAN ---
Disappointing!
--- KATE MONSTER ---
What's the matter?
--- BRIAN ---
The caterine company
laid me off.
--- KATE MONSTER ---
Oh, I'm sorry!
--- BRIAN ---
Me too! I mean, look at me!
I'm ten years out of college, and I
always thought -
--- KATE MONSTER ---
What?
--- BRIAN ---
No, it sounds stupid.
--- KATE MONSTER ---
Aww, come on!
--- BRIAN ---
When I was little
I thought I would be...
--- KATE MONSTER ---
What?
--- BRIAN ---
A big comedian
on late night TV
But now I'm thirty-two
And as you can see
I'm not
--- KATE MONSTER ---
Nope!
--- BRIAN ---
Oh Well,
It sucks to be me.
--- KATE MONSTER ---
Nooo.
--- BRIAN ---
It sucks to be me.
--- KATE MONSTER ---
No!
--- BRIAN ---
It sucks to be broke
and unemployed
and turning thirty-three.
It sucks to be me.
--- KATE MONSTER ---
Oh, you think your life sucks?
--- BRIAN ---
I think so.
--- KATE MONSTER ---
Your problems aren't so bad!
I'm kinda pretty
And pretty damn smart.
--- BRIAN ---
You are.
--- KATE MONSTER ---
Thanks!
I like romantic things
Like music and art.
And as you know
I have a gigantic heart
So why don't I have
A boyfriend?
Fuck!
It sucks to be me!
--- BRIAN ---
Me too.
--- KATE MONSTER ---
It sucks to be me.
--- BRIAN ---
It sucks to be me.
It sucks to be Brian...
--- KATE MONSTER ---
And Kate...
--- BRIAN ---
To not have a job!
--- KATE MONSTER ---
To not have a date!
--- BOTH ---
It sucks to be me.
--- BRIAN ---
Hey, ROd, Nicky, can you
settle something for us?
Do you have a second?
--- ROD ---
Ah, certainly.
--- KATE MONSTER ---
Whose life sucks more?
Brian's or mine?
--- NICKY AND ROD ---
Ours!
--- ROD ---
We live together.
--- NICKY ---
We're as close
As people can get.
--- ROD ---
We've been the best
of buddies...
--- NICKY ---
Ever since the
Day we met.
--- ROD ---
So he knows lots
Of ways to make me
Really upset.
Oh, every day is
An aggravation.
--- NICKY ---
Come on, that's
an exaggeration!
--- ROD ---
You leave your
clothes out.
You put your feet
On my chair.
--- NICKY ---
Oh yeah?
You do such anal
Things like ironing
Your underwear.
--- ROD ---
You make that very
Small apartment
We share a hell.
--- NICKY ---
So do you,
That's why I'm in hell too!
--- ROD ---
It sucks to be me!
--- NICKY ---
No, it sucks to be me!
--- KATE MONSTER ---
It sucks to be me!
--- BRIAN ---
It sucks to be me!
--- ALL ---
Is there anybody here
It doesn't suck to be?
It sucks to be me!
--- CHRISTMAS EVE ---

Excuse me?
--- BRIAN ---
Hey there.
--- PRINCETON ---
Sorry to bother you, but I'm
looking for a place to live.
--- CHRISTMAS EVE ---
Why you looking all
the way out here?
--- PRINCETON ---
Well, I started at Avenue A,
but so far everything is out
of my price range.  But this
neighborhood looks a lot cheaper!
Oh, and look - a For Rent sign!
--- BRIAN ---
You need to talk to
the superintendent.
Let me get him.
--- PRINCETON ---
Great, thanks!
--- BRIAN ---
Yo, Gary!
--- GARY COLEMAN ---
I'm comin'! I'm comin'!
--- PRINCETON ---
Oh my God!
It's Gary Coleman!
--- GARY COLEMAN ---
Yes I am!
I'm Gary Coleman
From TV's
Diff'rent Strokes
I made a lotta money
That got stolen
By my folks!
Now I'm broke and
I'm the butt
Of everyone's jokes,
But I'm here -
The Superintendent!
On Avenue Q -
--- ALL ---
It sucks to be you.
--- KATE MONSTER ---
You win!
--- ALL ---
It sucks to be you.
--- BRIAN ---
I feel better now!
--- GARY COLEMAN ---
Try having people
stopping you to ask you
What you talkin' 'bout, Willis?
It gets old.
--- ALL ---
It sucks to be you
On Avenue Q
On Avenue Q
On Avenue Q
But not when
We're together.
We're together
Here on Avenue Q!
