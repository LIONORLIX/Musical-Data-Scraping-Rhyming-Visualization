------ For Now ------
--- PRINCETON ---
Why does everything have to be so hard?
--- GARY COLEMAN ---
Maybe you'll never find your purpose.
--- CHRISTMAS EVE ---
Lots of people don't.
--- PRINCETON ---
But then- I don't know why I'm even alive!
--- KATE MONSTER ---
Well, who does, really?
Everyone's a little bit unsatisfied.
--- BRIAN ---
Everyone goes 'round a little empty inside.
--- GARY COLEMAN ---
Take a breath,
Look around,
--- BRIAN ---
Swallow your pride,
--- KATE MONSTER ---
FOr now...
--- BRIAN, KATE, GARY, CHRISTMAS EVE ---
For now...
--- NICKY ---
Nothing lasts,
--- ROD ---
Life goes on,
--- NICKY ---
Full of surprises.

You'll be faced with problems of all shapes and sizes.
--- CHRISTMAS EVE ---
You're going to have to make a few compromises...
For now...
--- TREKKIE MONSTER ---
For now...
--- ALL ---
But only for now! (For now)
Only for now! (For now)
Only for now! (For now)
Only for now!
--- LUCY ---
For now we're healthy.
--- BRIAN ---
For now we're employed.

If not overjoyed.

And we'll accept the things we cannot avoid, for now...

Don't stress,
Relax,
Let life roll off your backs
Except for death and paying taxes,
Everything in life is only for now!
--- NICKY ---
Each time you smile...
--- ALL ---

--- KATE MONSTER ---
It'll only last a while.
--- ALL ---

--- PRINCETON ---
Life may be scary...
--- ALL ---
...Only for now
But it's only temporary
