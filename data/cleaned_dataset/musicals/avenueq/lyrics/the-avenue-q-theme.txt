------ The Avenue Q Theme ------
--- COMPANY ---
The sun is shining,
It's a lovely day,
A perfect morning
For a kid to play,
But you're got lots
Of bills to pay -
What can you do?
--- Unknown ---
Your work real hard
And the pay's real low
And ev'ry hour
Goes oh, so slow
And at the end of the day
There's no where to go
But home to Avenue Q!
You live on Avenue Q!
You're friends do too.
You are twenty-two
And you live on Avenue Q!
You live on Avenue Q
