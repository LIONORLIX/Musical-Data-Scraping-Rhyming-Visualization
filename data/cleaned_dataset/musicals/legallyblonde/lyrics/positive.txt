Honey whatcha cryin at?
You're not losing him to that
Both her hair and shoes are flat
Why is she so rude?
--- MARGOT ---
Wipe your tears, it's no big thing
You were meant to wear his ring
Cheer-up, chin-up
It's time to bring
--- GREEK CHORUS ---
A happy attitude

Keep it positive
As you slap her to the floor
GREEK CHORUS:
Keep it positive

Not the way to win back guys
Anyway she's twice my size

Show him you are way more fun
Bust out the lap dance

Hey, hey, hey!
We're positive

You're hotta'
And I bet ya smarter!
She don't know the real him

So don't her her steal him
Wake him up like sleepin beauty
Turn his head with your red hot booty
You bring the noise if we bring the funk
