------ Serious (Reprise) ------
--- Warner(spoken) ---
I still can't believe you're here at Harvard.  Back at UCLA I never would have guessed!
Sometimes I miss the old days...
--- Unknown ---
(singing) Those parties senior year I thought we ruled the world
--- Elle ---
You funneled all that beer
I held your head when you hurled
--- Warner ---
We were like Gods back then
walking among common men
Tell me why can't it be
that way again?
--- Elle ---
Dreams don't just disappear
We could keep on dreaming them here
--- Warner(spoken) ---
What?
--- Elle ---
(spoken)Like senior year but funner!
(sung) You've got your future all planned
--- Warner ---
Yes I do Yes I do
--- Elle ---
What if I'm standing there too?
--- Warner ---
Wait I'm not following you
--- Elle ---
I'm here cause I understand
--- Warner ---
Not sure I understand
--- Elle ---
I'm here cause I'm serious
--- Warner(spoken) ---
Yeah right you look real serious
