------ Legally Blonde ------
--- ELLE ---
Take back the books and pack up the clothes
Clear out the room and drop off the key
Leave with what's left of my dignity
Get in the car and just go
--- Unknown ---
Chalk it all up to experience
They said I'd fail but I disagreed
Who could say then where my path would lead?
Well, now I know
--- Unknown ---
Back to the sun
Back to the shore
Back to what I was before
--- Unknown ---
Back where I'm known
Back in my own
Very small pond
--- Unknown ---
Laugh with my friends
When I arrive
We'll drop the top and just drive
That's fine with me
Just let me be
Legally Blonde
--- Unknown ---
Thanks for your help and for all you've done
Thank you for treating me decently
--- EMMETT ---
(spoken) What's wrong?
--- ELLE ---
Maybe someday you can visit me
Give me a call, say hello
--- EMMETT ---
Wait, where are you going?
--- ELLE ---
Sorry I'm letting down everyone
--- EMMETT ---
What brought on this?
--- ELLE ---
You did your best with a hopeless case
--- EMMETT ---
That's ludicrous
--- BOTH ---
You are the best thing about this place
--- EMMETT ---
Elle, you should know...
--- ELLE ---
(spoken) Callahan hit on me.
--- EMMETT ---
(spoken) He what?
--- ELLE ---
(spoken) He kissed me.  He fired me.  There's no reason for me to stay.
--- EMMETT ---
What about love?
I never mentioned love
The timing's bad, I know
But perhaps if I made it more clear
That you belong right here
You wouldn't have to go
Cause you know that I'm so much in love...
--- ELLE ---
Back to the sun
Back to the shore
Back to what I was before
--- EMMETT ---
Please will you open the door
--- ELLE ---
Lie on the beach
Dream within reach
Don't stray beyond
--- EMMETT ---
We both know you're worth so much more
--- ELLE ---
Some girls fight hard
Some face the trial
Some girls were just meant to smile
--- EMMETT ---
If you can hear, can I just say
How much I want you to stay
--- ELLE ---
It's not up to me
Just let me be
Legally Blonde
--- EMMETT ---
I need you to stay...
--- ELLE ---
It's not up to me
Just let me be
Legally Blonde
