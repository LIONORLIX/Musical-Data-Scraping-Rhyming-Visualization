------ Take It Like A Man ------

(Talking)
Emmett:
What is this place?
--- Elle ---
It's called a Department Store.
--- Emmett ---
It's- It's beautiful.
--- Elle ---
Shhh?
--- Unknown ---
(singing)
Elle:
First a deep breath
Take it all in
Feel all those halogens warming your skin
Smell how they pump in pure oxygen.
See, they care.
--- Unknown ---
(talking)
Lady:
Love?
--- Emmett ---
Excuse me?
--- Lady ---
Love, the new fragrance from Chanel.
--- Emmett ---
Oh. No thank you.
--- Unknown ---
(singing)
Elle:
I know you're scared
Nevertheless
Think of the people you want to impress
Swallow your pride for me
Just nod yes and prepare
Cause something's in the air
--- Unknown ---
(talking)
Emmett:
I think its love
--- Elle ---
Exactly!
--- Unknown ---
(singing)
Elle:
Here you'll become what you're supposed to be
You think you can't but you can.
Think of the guy you want most to be.
Here's your chance to make it
So take it like a man.
--- Emmett ---
What does she want?
Not really sure
Why can't we leave things the way that they were?
Why can I never say no to her?
What's that smell?
--- Unknown ---
(talking)
Guy:
Subtext, by Calvin Klein.
--- Unknown ---
(singing)
Emmett:
That I don't like,
That's kind of neat.
Guys who wear that get beat up on my street.
Still I've come this far,
I can't retreat in my shell
I'm in the hands of Elle!
What the hell?
--- Both ---
Here you'll become what you're suppose to be
You think you can't but you can.
Think of the guy you want most to be.
Here's your chance to make it
So take it like a man.
--- Elle ---
God, I love shopping for guys!
Emmett:
Okay this is strange.
Elle:
Watching the change right before my eyes.
Emmett:
Don't watch me change.
--- Elle ---
Look at him striking a pose.
His confidence grows.
He'll bloom like a rose.
Emmett:
Its just clothes
--- Elle ---
God I love shopping for men.
Emmett:
Okay, this is nice.
Elle:
They walk in at two
They walk out at ten
Emmett:
Is this the price?
--- Elle ---
Don't worry this is my treat,
There's someone I'd like you to meet.
--- Unknown ---
(talking)
Both:
Whoa.
--- Emmett ---
I look like Warner.
Elle:
Yeah.
Emmett:
But it's just me.
--- Unknown ---
(singing)
Elle:
That's the best part
The outside is new.
But now it reflects, what's already in you.
Couldn't change that if I wanted to
And I do not.
--- Unknown ---
(talking)
Emmett:
Thank You
--- Elle ---
No, Thank You.
--- Unknown ---
(singing)
Elle:
This is no gift,
It's payment in kind,
Cause you saw beyond all the blonde to my mind
Oh, we've got to buy this,
What, are you blind?
You look hot!
Is he not hot!!!!!
--- Background ---
He's hot, hot, hot, hot
--- Background[+Elle&Emmett] ---
Here you'll become what you're suppose to be
You think you can't but you can.
Think of the guy you want most to be.
--- Emmett ---
Not quite the guy I'd of chose to be
But when she's standing so close to me
I think I like her plan
--- Elle(+Emmett) ---
Here's your chance to make it(Your chance to make it)
So take it like?(So take it like)
A man!!! (A man!!!)
A man!!! (A man!!!)
A man!!! (A man!!!)
