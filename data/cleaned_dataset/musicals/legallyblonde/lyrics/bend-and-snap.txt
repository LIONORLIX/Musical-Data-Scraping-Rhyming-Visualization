------ Bend and Snap ------
--- GIRL ---
Look at my ass
Look at my thighs
I'm catnip to the guys
They chase my tail
They drool and pant
Wanna touch this but they can't
--- Unknown ---
No!  All the boys want to come and play
Snap my fingers and they obey
Why do they follow me around all day
Watch me while I walk away
--- Unknown ---
I bend and snap
Feel how hot it's getting
Bend and snap
Then when you got em sweatin'
Spring the trap
They cheer and clap
No tight end can defend against the bend and snap
--- PAULETTE ---
(spoken) Oh that's easy for you to say!
--- ELLE ---
(spoken) And you!
--- Unknown ---
(sung) Girl if you want to make the team, then fake some self esteem
--- GIRL ---
The more you jump around and scream
The sexier you seem
--- PAULETTE ---
Sorry girls that ain't how I play
This wouldn't work if I tried all day
I gotta go get my asthma spray
Watch me while I walk away
--- ELLE ---
No wait before you walk away
Just bend and snap
--- PAULETTE ---
