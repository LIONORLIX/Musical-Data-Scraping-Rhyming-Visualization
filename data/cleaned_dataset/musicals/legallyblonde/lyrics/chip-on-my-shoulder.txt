------ Chip On My Shoulder ------
--- EMMETT ---
(spoken) Whoa, Elle?  What's up, Doc?
--- ELLE ---
Love
--- EMMETT ---
(spoken) Excuse me?
--- ELLE ---
I put my faith in love
I followed where it led
--- EMMETT ---
(spoken) Love led you here?
--- ELLE ---
To my personal circle of Hell
It has not worked out well
I wish that I were dead
--- Unknown ---
Cause instead of a wedding in love
I'm flunking out of school
A total laughing stock
Someone he and his friends could just mock
So go on, here's my head
Just hand over the rock!
--- EMMETT ---
(spoken) Wait, go back!
--- Unknown ---
(sung) You came out here to follow a man
Harvard law was just part of that plan
Man, what rich romantic planet are you from?
--- ELLE ---
(spoken) Malibu?
--- EMMETT ---
Instead of lying outside by the pool
You stalk some guy to an ivy league school?
That's the weirdest reason I have--
--- ELLE ---
(spoken) Oh, why'd you come?
--- EMMETT ---
(spoken) Okay
--- Unknown ---
(sung) I grew up in the Roxbury slums
With my mom and a series of bums
Guys who showed me all the ways a man can fail
--- Unknown ---
I got through law school by busting my ass
Worked two jobs in addition to class
So forgive me for not weeping at your tale
--- ELLE ---
(spoken) Well excuse me,
just because you've got some kind of chip on your shoulder . . .
--- EMMETT ---
(spoken) You know what?  You're right.
--- Unknown ---
(sung) There's a chip on my shoulder
And it's big as a boulder
With the chance I've been given
I'm gonna be driven as hell
--- Unknown ---
I'm so close I can taste it
So I'm not gonna waste it
Yeah, there's a chip on my shoulder
You might wanna get one as well
--- ELLE ---
(spoken) I'm sorry, but that sounds highly negative.  Wait!
Two jobs PLUS law school?!  How do you do it?
--- EMMETT ---
Well, I don't go to parties a lot
Not good use of the time that I've got
Can't spend hours doing my hair and staying in shape
--- ELLE ---
(spoken) I don't spend hours!
--- EMMETT ---
But I know it'll all be worthwhile
When I win my first lucrative trial
And buy my mom that great big house out on the cape!
--- ELLE ---
(spoken) Oh, that's so sweet!
--- EMMETT ---
No!  That's the chip on my shoulder
I hugged my mom and told her
With the chance I've been given
I'm gonna be driven as hell
--- Unknown ---
Though I can't take the day off
I just think of the payoff
You need a chip on your shoulder
Little Miss Woods comma Elle
--- ELLE ---
(spoken) I just need to prove to everyone that I'm serious!
--- EMMETT ---
(spoken) What you need is to get to work!  Where are your law books?
--- ELLE ---
(spoken) Ummm . . . Well, I know they're here somewhere . . .
--- EMMETT ---
Ya know, this vanity's real picturesque
But it started its life as a desk
Clear it off, and find some room for books instead
--- ELLE ---
(spoken) What are you doing?!
--- EMMETT ---
Can you live without this?
Can you live without that?
I don't know what this is
--- ELLE ---
(spoken) It's for hair!
--- EMMETT ---
Wear a hat!
Spend some time improving what's inside your head!
--- Unknown ---
Out, out, put it in storage, sell it on eBay, leave it behind
Out, out, what, are you angry?
Good, so get angry!  You may find
The chip on your shoulder
--- ELLE ---
(spoken) ARGH!
--- EMMETT ---
The room just got colder
--- ELLE ---
(spoken) Hey!
--- EMMETT ---
But with the chance you've been given
Why are you not driven as hell?!
There's just no way around it
You gotta plow through til you've
--- ELLE ---
(spoken) Found it!
--- EMMETT ---
Been reading it hard, I can tell . . .
--- GIRLS ---
Tis a gift to be simple
Tis a gift to be free
Hmm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm
--- ELLE ---
(spoken) Bye, Warner!  Have a great Thanksgiving!
Say hi to your mom and dad for me!  And Grandma Bootsie!
--- EMMETT ---
(spoken) Define malum prohibitum.
--- ELLE ---
(spoken) Malum prohibitum is, ummm . . .
--- EMMETT ---
(spoken) An act prohibited--
--- ELLE ---
(spoken) An act prohibited by law like jaywalking or chewing gum in Singapore.
--- EMMETT ---
(spoken) Therefore malum ensae?
--- ELLE ---
(spoken) Is an action.  That is evil in itself.
Assualt, murder, white shoes after labor day.
--- EMMETT ---
(spoken) Good. Where are you going?
--- ELLE ---
(spoken) Home, of course!  It's Thanksgiving break, remember?
--- EMMETT ---
(spoken) Interesting.
--- ELLE ---
(spoken) What?
--- EMMETT ---
Well, I predict you will probably pass
--- ELLE ---
(spoken) Yes!
--- EMMETT ---
In the bottom percent of your class
--- ELLE ---
(spoken) What?
--- EMMETT ---
If you're going for mediocre, you've done great!
--- ELLE ---
(spoken) That's not fair!
--- EMMETT ---
Look, they laughed at me like they're laughing at you
We can't win if we don't follow through!
Might I venture your vacation plans can wait?
--- ELLE ---
(spoken) Why do you always have to be right?
--- GIRLS ---
Glo-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-ria!  (Latin chanting)
--- ELLE ---
(spoken) Bye, Warner!  Merry Christmas!  Enjoy Bayo!
--- EMMETT ---
(spoken) Ho-ho-ho!
--- ELLE ---
(spoken) Emmett!
--- EMMETT ---
(spoken) For you!  Not as good as going home for Christmas, but . . .
--- ELLE ---
(spoken) You are too sweet.
--- EMMETT ---
(spoken) It's a real time saver.  Shampoo and conditioner in one!
--- ELLE ---
(spoken) Ah!  (giggles)  Thank you.  You are so adorable to think of me.
--- WARNER ---
(spoken) Elle, hey!
--- ELLE ---
(spoken) Warner!
--- WARNER ---
(spoken) Have you seen Vivienne? I've been looking for her everywhere!
--- ELLE ---
(spoken) Yeah . . . I-I mean no.
--- WARNER ---
(spoken) Great!  We're gonna miss our flight!
--- EMMETT ---
(spoken)Um, Elle?
--- Unknown ---
(sung)I don't know if you've noticed before
But each time Warner walks in the door
Your IQ goes down to 40, maybe less
--- ELLE ---
(spoken) Huh?
--- EMMETT ---
Though it's hardly my business to say
Could it be the real thing in your way
Is the very guy you're trying to impress
--- ELLE ---
Yes!  I've been smiling and sweet and thoroughly beaten blowing my chance
Let's not chase him away
Let's face him and say
Hey punk, let's dance!
--- Unknown ---
This chip on my shoulder
Makes me smarter and bolder
No more whining or blaming
I am reclaiming my pride
--- Unknown ---
Grab that book and let's do this
Instead of doodling hearts all through this
Now there's a chip on my shoulder!
Let's see him knock it aside!
--- GIRLS ---
Ah-ah-ah-ah Daughter of Delta Nu
Show him that you're no fool
Daughter of Delta Nu
Go back to school with a big chip on your shoulder!
--- WARNER ---
(spoken) Mr. Ladimer was clearly within his rights to ask for visitation.
Without his sperm, the child in question wouldn't exist!
--- CALLAHAN ---
(spoken) Now you're thinking like a lawyer!
Yes, Miss Woods.
--- ELLE ---
(spoken) Mr. Huntington makes an excellent point,
but did the defendant keep a log of every sperm emission made throughout his life?
--- CALLAHAN ---
(spoken) Interesting.  Why do you ask?
--- ELLE ---
(spoken) Well, unless the defendant attempted to contact every sexual encounter
to find out if a child resulted from those unions,
he has no parental claim over this child whatsoever.
Why now?  Why this sperm?
--- CALLAHAN ---
(spoken) I see your point.
--- ELLE ---
(spoken) And by Mr. Huntington's standards,
all masturbatory emissions where the sperm was clearly not seeking an egg would
be called reckless abandonment.
--- CALLAHAN ---
(spoken) Miss Woods, you just won your case.
--- ELLE ---
Ohmigod . . .
--- GIRLS ---
Wait, hold on, we just won the case!
--- ELLE ---
Omigod . . .
--- GIRLS ---
Elle got all up in Warner's face
--- ELLE ---
Omigod . . .
--- GIRLS ---
I am starting to like this place!  Yes!  Omigod!
--- CALLAHAN ---
(spoken) Miss Woods, excellent work today.
I assume you're applying for my internship.  Do you have a resume?
--- ELLE ---
(spoken) I am one step ahead of you.
Here you go, and thanks in advance for your consideration.
--- CALLAHAN ---
(spoken) Dear God, it's scented.
Three months ago, I would have recycled this.  Make sure to put it on file.
--- EMMETT ---
Guess she got a chip on her shoulder
Maybe some wise man told her
With the chance we've been given
We gotta be driven as hell
--- Unknown ---
She was something to see there
I'm just happy I could be there
First big test and she aced it
She's so close she can taste it
--- Unknown ---
She got a chip on her shoulder
Guess you never can te-e-ell . . .
With little Miss Woods comma Elle!
