------ The Harvard Variations ------
--- EMMETT ---
(spoken) Hello. I'm Emmett Forrest. Class of aught seven. Represent. Welcome to the hallowed halls of Harvard Law. I know firsthand how hard you've all worked to be here today. So, let's go around and share a bit about yourselves.
--- AARON ---
(spoken) Aaron Shultz.
--- Unknown ---
(sung) I won a Fulbright and a Rhodes
I write financial software codes
But that's a challenge I've outgrown
How many yachts can one man own?
--- Unknown ---
Some say that I'm a pompous creep
Somehow I don't lose that much sleep
Why bother with false modesty?
Harvard's the perfect place for me
--- EMMETT & STUDENTS ---
Pretty impressive, good to know
--- EMMETT ---
Welcome to Harvard
--- SUNDEEP ---
What's up?
--- ENID ---
Yo!
--- SUNDEEP ---
(spoken) Sundeep Agrawal Padomadon, but you may call me your majesty.
--- Unknown ---
(sung) In my country
My word was law
But then I flee
Because of stupid coup d'etat
--- Unknown ---
But here I learn
I make new friends
And soon return
In bullet-proof Mercedes Benz
--- EMMETT & STUDENTS ---
Pretty impressive, good to know
--- EMMETT ---
Welcome to Har--
--- ENID ---
(spoken) ENID HOOPES!
--- Unknown ---
(sung) I did the peace corps overseas
Inoculating refugees
In family clinics that I built myself
From mud and trees
--- Unknown ---
I fought to clean up their lagoons
And save their rare endangered loons
And led a protest march against insensitive cartoons
--- STUDENTS ---
Pretty impressive, good--
--- ENID ---
But now I'm on the legal track
Because this country's out of whack
And only women have the guts to go and take it back
--- Unknown ---
We'll make the government come clean
And get more people voting green
And really stick it to the phallocentric war machine
--- ELLE ---
(spoken) I love your top! It is so fatigue chic!
Anyone know where I can find Criminal Law 101 with Professor Callahan? And
Warner Huntington the Third?
--- EMMETT ---
(spoken) It's in Houser.  Over there, second building on the left.
--- ELLE ---
(spoken) Thanks!
