------ There! Right There! ------
--- Elle ---
There! Right There!
Look at that tan, well tinted skin.
Look at the killer shape he's in.
Look at that slightly stubbly chin.
Oh Please he's gay, totally gay.
--- Callahan ---
I'm not about to celebrate.
Every trait could indicate the totally straight expatriate.
This guy's not gay, I say not gay.
--- All ---
That is the elephant in the room.
Well is it relevant to assume
that a man who wears perfume
is automatically radically fey?
--- Emmett ---
But look at his coiffed and crispy locks.
--- Elle ---
Look at his silk translucent socks.
--- Callahan ---
There's the eternal paradox.
Look what we're seeing.
--- Elle ---
What are we seeing?
--- Callahan ---
Is he gay?
--- Elle ---
Of course he's gay.
--- Calahan ---
Or European?
--- All ---
ohhhhhh.
Gay or European?
It's hard to guarantee
Is he gay or European?
--- Warner ---
Well, hey don't look at me.
--- Vivian ---
You see they bring their boys up different in those charming foreign ports.
They play peculiar sports.
--- All ---
In shiny shirts and tiny shorts.
Gay or foreign fella?
The answer could take weeks.
They both say things like ciao bella
while they kiss you on both cheeks.
--- Elle ---
Oh please.
--- All ---
Gay or European?
So many shades of gray.
--- Warner ---
Depending on the time of day, the French go either way.
--- All ---
Is he gay or European?
or
--- Enid ---
There! Right There!
Look at that condescending smirk.
Seen it on every guy at work.
That is a metro hetero jerk.
That guy's not gay, I say no way.
--- All ---
That is the elephant in the room.
Well is it relevant to presume
that a hottie in that costume
--- Elle ---
Is automatically-radically
--- Callahan ---
Ironically chronically
--- Vivian ---
Certainly pertin'tly
--- Warner ---
Genetically medically
--- All ---
GAY!
OFFICIALLY GAY!
OFFICIALLY GAY GAY GAY GAY
DAMNIT!
--- Unknown ---
Gay or European?
--- Callahan ---
So stylish and relaxed.
--- All ---
Is he gay or European?
--- Callahan ---
I think his chest is waxed.
--- Vivian ---
But they bring their boys up different there.
It's culturally diverse.
It's not a fashion curse.
--- All ---
If he wears a kilt or bears a purse.
Gay or just exotic?
I still can't crack the code.
--- Brooke ---
Yes his accent is hypnotic
but his shoes are pointy toed.
--- All ---
Huh.
Gay or European?
So many shades of gray.
--- Judge ---
But if he turns out straight I'm free at eight on Saturday.
--- All ---
Is he gay or European?
gay or european?
Gay or Euro-
--- Emmett ---
Wait a minute!
Give me a chance to crack this guy.
I have an idea I'd like to try.
--- Callahan ---
The floor is yours.
--- Emmett ---
So Mr. Architacos...
This alleged affair with Ms. Windam has been going on for...?
--- Mikos ---
2 years.
--- Emmett ---
And your first name again is...?
--- Mikos ---
Mikos.
--- Emmett ---
And your boyfriend's name is...?
--- Mikos ---
Carlos.
I'm sorry! I misunderstand. You say boyfriend.
I thought you say best friend. Carlos is my best friend.
--- Carlos ---
You bastard!
You lying bastard!
That's it.
I no cover for you, no more!
Peoples.
I have a big announcement.
This man is Gay and European!
and neither is disgrace
you've got to stop your being
a completely closet case.
It's me not her he's seeing
No matter what he say.
I swear he never ever ever swing the other way.
You are so gay.
You big parfait!
You flaming boy band cabaret.
--- Mikos ---

--- Carlos ---
You were not yesterday.
So if I may, I'm proud to say,
He's gay!
