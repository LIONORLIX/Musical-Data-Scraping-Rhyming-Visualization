------ Legally Blonde Remix ------
--- VIVIENNE, ---
(Spoken) Maybe Warner saw a blonde who was sleeping her way to the top,
but I see a woman who doesn't have to.
--- Unknown ---
(Sung) I used to pray for the day you'd leave
Swore up and down
You would not belong
--- Unknown ---
But when I am wrong
I say I'm wrong
and I was wrong about you
--- Unknown ---
So listen up!
I see no end to what you'll achieve
That's only if you don't turn and run
--- Unknown ---
You proved it to me
Now show everyone what you can do
And you look great in dark blue!
--- Unknown ---
Get back in the game
Back on the case
Take a good look at my face
I'm not a fool
And as a rule
I do not bond
--- Unknown ---
But I see a star
You're my new muse
You've got the best freakin' shoes!
And you lit a fuse
So go show them who's
Legally Blonde!
--- CHORUS, ---
Sha la la la la la

Yes, you lit a fuse
So go show them who's
Legally ...
