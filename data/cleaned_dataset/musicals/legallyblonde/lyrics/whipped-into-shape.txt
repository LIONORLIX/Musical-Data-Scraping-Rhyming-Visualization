------ Whipped Into Shape ------
--- BROOKE ---
(spoken) Hi, I'm Brooke Windham and welcome back
to the Windham Workout Disk Two Challenge and our daily commitment to being
the best that we can be!
--- VIDEO PEOPLE ---
(spoken) Yeah!
--- Unknown ---
So grab your CardioWhyp 5000(TM)...
'Cause if you want to get ripped, you've gotta get... Whypped!
--- Unknown ---
(sung) Do you want an easy miracle?
Do you want to lose a pound or two?
Then you can turn this off right now
My workout's not for you.
--- I'm talkin' to the woman who wants it all ---
Gotta pay for what you get
These size 2 clothes don't come to those
Too lazy to sweat!
--- Unknown ---
I want you whipped into shape
When I say jump, say How high?
You'll know you're doing it right
When you start to cry
--- Unknown ---
If you don't look like you should,
You've got to whip it, whip it, whip it good
I'm sorry, ladies, no escape
Til you're whipped into shape!
--- Unknown ---
(spoken) Come on, Sabrina, you heifer! Work it out!
--- SABRINA ---
(spoken) I hate you, Brooke!  And I love you for it!
--- Unknown ---
Whipped into sh--
--- ENID ---
(spoken) Hey, why'd you pause it?
--- CALLAHAN ---
(spoken) We have a lot to cover.
--- Unknown ---
(sung) Meet our brand new client, Brooke
You can laugh, but she's made tons
Off her DVDs and book
Whip Your Way to Tighter Buns
--- Unknown ---
Happily married, so she swears
To her sixty-year-old stud
Til stepdaughter came downstairs
And found Brooke all covered in his blood
--- Unknown ---
If Brooke took a plea
I'd have her out in 3 to 4
But she claims she did not kill him
--- WARNER ---
(spoken) Did she?
--- CALLAHAN ---
(spoken) Let's watch some more...
--- BROOKE ---
But it's more than just a workout
It's a defensive weapon too
Simply wrap it round your assailant's neck
And pull til he turns blue!
--- Unknown ---
You can also use the patented handle grip
To shatter your attacker's spine
And all for three small payments of
$19.99!
--- Unknown ---
You'll have him whipped into shape
When you get grief from a guy
Just work him over with this
Til he starts to cry
--- Unknown ---
If he don't act like he should
You've got to whip it, whip it, whip it good
It gets you out of any scrape
It gets you whipped into shape
--- Unknown ---
(spoken) Come on, people!
--- Unknown ---
(sung) Whipped into shape!
--- Unknown ---
(spoken) What does not kill us makes us hotter!
--- CALLAHAN ---
(spoken) Hands?  Who thinks she's guilty?
--- (sung) Okay, now here is where you kids come in ---
Brooke has trouble trusting me
I'm her only chance to win
But I don't speak MTV
--- Unknown ---
Though Brooke won't help her own defense
She may listen to her peers
Go and place a little sense
In the space between her ears
--- ELLE ---
(spoken) I'm a Delta N--
--- CALLAHAN ---
(spoken) Not now.
--- Unknown ---
(sung)I want her whipped into shape
If there's a brain in that hair
Tell it that I am the key
It's a plea or the chair
--- Unknown ---
See when I talk to her I
Get neither plea nor plan nor alibi
To quote from our defendant's tape:
I want her whipped into shape!
--- Unknown ---
(spoken) To the jail!
--- BROOKE ---
(spoken) Ladies,
just because we're at Boston Women's Correctional Facility does not mean
we can't become the best that we can be!  HERE WE GO!
--- Unknown ---
Circle!  Circle!  Under!  Over!  Through!  Around!  Again!  Good!
--- Unknown ---
Circle!  Circle!  Under!  Over!  Through!
Around!  All right, ladies, we can't break out of here, but we sure can break a sweat!
--- Unknown ---
Left!  Right!  Left!  Right!  Good!
Left!  Right!  Left!  Right!  Left!  Right!
--- Unknown ---
Work it out!
--- Unknown ---
(sung) I want you whipped into shape
When I say jump, say How high?
You know you're doing it right
When you start to cry
--- Unknown ---
If you don't look like you should
You've got to whip it, whip it, whip it good
Like prison, ladies, no escape
Til you're whipped into shape!
--- Unknown ---
Whip it!  Whip it!
--- Unknown ---
Whipped into shape
--- Unknown ---
Whip it!  Whip it!
--- Unknown ---
Swipe it!  Swipe it!  Swipe it through!  Check it out!  Double jump!
--- Unknown ---
Swipe it!  Swipe it!  Swipe it through!  Check it out!  Double jump!
