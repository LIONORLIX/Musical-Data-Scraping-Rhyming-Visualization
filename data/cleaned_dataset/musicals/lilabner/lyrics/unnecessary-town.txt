------ Unnecessary Town ------
--- Unknown ---
Oh it's unnecessary
Just a speck on the map
Where the trail from the Smokies
Reaches old Gopher Gap
With the sheep in the meadow
And the bees in the comb
Oh, it's unnecessary
But it's home, sweet home
--- Unknown ---
Oh it's unnecessary
Just a small little town
With the wind in the willows
And the moon beaming down
It's almost like a postcard
Done in pure kodachrome
Oh it's unnecessary
But it's home, sweet home
--- Unknown ---
With the sheep in the meadow
And the bees in the comb
Oh, it's unnecessary
