------ Love In A Home ------
--- Unknown ---
You can tell,
When you open the door!
You can tell,
When there's love  in a home!
Every table and chair seems to smile,
Come on in, sit a spell, stay a while.
You almost feel you've been there once before,
By the shine and the glow of the room!
And the clock seems to chime,
Come again anytime,
You'll be welcome wherever you roam!
You can tell when there's love in a home!
--- Unknown ---
You can tell when you open the door,
You can tell when there's love in a home.
Ev'ry picture you see seems to say,
Where you been, you been too long away?
The laughter rings and the tea kettle sings
Like the people who live in the room.
And the clock seems to chime come again anytime
You'll be welcome wherever you roam.
You can tell when there's love in a home.
