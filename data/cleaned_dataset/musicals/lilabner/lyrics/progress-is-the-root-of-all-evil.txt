------ Progress Is The Root Of All Evil ------
--- Unknown ---
Progress is the root of all evil,
Politics is breaking my heart.
Why ever since the first New Deal,
A man who has no mass appeal
is out of business.
--- Unknown ---
If you don't believe me, ask Dewey
Go and see what Harriman says.
My friends say I could run for any
Office I seek
But first I'd have to brush up
On my TV technique,
I plan to get in touch with
Bob Montgomery next week.
Bring back the good old days!

Progress is the root of all evil
How's a busy man to relax?
I'd like to join a golf club --where?
They built a supermarket there.
And for the public!
Being wealthy seems to mean nothing.
Let me show you how the land lays:
I went to see the president,
They asked me to wait,
And tho' I knew that he was swamped
With matters of state,
A fellow named Ben Hogan
Walked right through the front gate!
