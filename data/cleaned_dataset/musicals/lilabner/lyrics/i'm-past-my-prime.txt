------ I'm Past My Prime ------
--- Unknown ---
Daisy Mae
Marryin' Sam
I'm past my prime
What a shame
And I'm losin' time
Guess the old clock's run down
Seventeen last spring
My, what a wasted life
Still without a ring
When will you be a wife?
I'm past my peak
You're an early antique
Look at this physique
Just hear the old bones creak
Where there was a glow
There ain't a glow no more
Now the wrinkles show
Where art Thou Romeo?
--- Unknown ---
Who'd think of marryin' an octogenarian,
Oh, me, oh, my
An eighty-seven year old hag
When you're in this position you'll lose your disposition
Oh, me, oh, my
All the time it's nag, nag, nag
--- Unknown ---
Life's like a song
And the happiest thing
When you're young and strong
Most everyday is spring
But it's just a crime
You can't get off the dime
When you're past your prime
--- Unknown ---
You's past your prime
Gettin' grumpy and grey
You's on over time
Ain't making take-home pay
Every sun that sets
All through the day I frets
Brings ya more regrets
And larger silhouettes
You's climb the heights
I is over the hill
Of romantic nights
My hand has lost it's skill
Comes the cruel dawn
I's feelin' pale and drawn
Lover boy has gone
Dog gone!
--- Unknown ---
I ask you who's elated when you's Methusilated
Oh, me, oh, my
Like a mummy underground
When you is antiquated
boys ain't enchanticated
Oh, me, oh, my
They prefers you in the round
--- Unknown ---
Life's just like pie
Huckleberry or peach?
When you're young and spry
Heaven's within your reach
But it's just a crime
How can it be sublime
When you're past your prime?
When you're past your prime?
