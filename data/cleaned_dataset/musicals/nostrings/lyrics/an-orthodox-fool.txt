------ An Orthodox Fool ------
--- Unknown ---
If I stood over there and looked my way
What a pitiful sight I'd see.
Stupid, stupider, stupidest.
This is the declension,
Of little declining me.
--- Unknown ---
I'm a self-educated idiot.
I'm an orthodox fool.
All I'm not I owe to myself,
Every discredit should go to myself.
I knew my way but I lost it.
The game was won but I tossed it.
I knew the speech but I mumbled.
I caught the ball but I fumbled.
--- Unknown ---
I'm a young victim of senility.
I am destiny's tool.
I am lucky that the world has me alive in it.
If the swimming pool was empty then I'd dive in it.
With my tarnished golden rule.
I am dumb, obtuse, absurd and blind!
I'm an orthodox fool.
--- Unknown ---
Shouldn't they have told me.
Love would come to own me.
Healing and wounding me too.
Nobody told me,
No, not even you.
Nobody told me, I knew.
--- Unknown ---
I'm a clear picture of imcompetence
Who was fired from school.
I put money in the market when it's slowing up.
I decend the escalator when it's going up.
Like a slightly well-read mule.
I am dull, benumbed, and not quite bright.
I'm an orthodox fool.
A crazy mixed up, card carrying dope,
Thick headed, dim-witted brain of soap.
A self-educated idiot.
I'm an orthodox fool! Fool! Fool!
