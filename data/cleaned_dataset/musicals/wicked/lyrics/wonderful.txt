------ Wonderful ------
--- WIZARD ---
I never asked for this
Or planned it in advance
I was merely blown here
By the winds of chance
I never saw myself
As a Solomon or Socrates
I knew who I was:
One of your dime a dozen
Mediocrities
--- Unknown ---
Then suddenly I'm here
Respected - worshipped, even
Just because the folks in Oz
Needed someone to believe in
Does it surprise you
I got hooked, and all too soon?
What can I say?
I got carried away
And not just by balloon:
--- Unknown ---
Wonderful
They called me Wonderful
So I said Wonderful - if you insist
I will be Wonderful
And they said Wonderful
Believe me, it's hard to resist
'Cause it feels wonderful
They think I'm wonderful
Hey, look who's wonderful -
This corn-fed hick
Who said: It might be keen
To build a town of green
And a wonderful road of yellow brick!
--- Unknown ---
(spoken) See - I never had a family of my own. So, I
guess I just - wanted to give the citizens of Oz everything.
--- Unknown ---
ELPHABA(spoken) So you lied to them.
--- WIZARD ---
(spoken) Elphaba, where I'm from, we believe all sorts of
things that aren't true. We call it - history.
--- Unknown ---
(sung) A man's called a traitor - or liberator
A rich man's a thief - or philanthropist
Is one a crusader - or ruthless invader?
It's all in which label
Is able to persist
There are precious few at ease
With moral ambiguities
So we act as though they don't exist
--- Unknown ---
They call me "Wonderful"
So I am wonderful
In fact - it's so much who I am
It's part of my name
And with my help, you can be the same
At long, long last receive your due
Long overdue
Elphaba - The most celebrated
Are the rehabilitated
There'll be such a - whoop-de-doo
A celebration throughout Oz
That's all to do - with you
--- Unknown ---
Wonderful
They'll call you wonderful:
--- ELPHABA ---
It does sound wonderful:
--- WIZARD ---
Trust me - it's fun
--- BOTH ---
When you are wonderful
It would be wonderful?
Wonderful, wonderful
--- WIZARD ---
One! Two! And:
