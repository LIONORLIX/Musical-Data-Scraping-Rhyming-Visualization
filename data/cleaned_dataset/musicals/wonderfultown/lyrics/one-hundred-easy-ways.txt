You’ve met a charming fellow and you’re out for a spin.
The motor fails and he just wears a helpless grin,
Don’t bat your eyes and say, ‘what a romantic spot we’re in.’
--- Unknown ---
Just get out, crawl under the car,
Tell him it’s the gasket and fix it in two seconds flat with a bobby pin.
--- Unknown ---
That’s a good way to lose a man.
--- Unknown ---
He takes you to a baseball game,
You sit knee to knee.
He says, ‘the next man up at bat will bunt, you’ll see.’
Don’t say, ‘oooh, what’s a bunt’ This game’s too hard for little me.’
--- Unknown ---
Just say, ‘bunt’ Are you nuts’!! With no outs, two men on base,
And a left-handed batter coming up,
You’ll walk right into a triple play just like it happened in
The fifth game of the world series in 1923.’
--- Unknown ---
That’s a sure way to lose a man.
--- Unknown ---
A sure sure sure sure way to lose a man,
A splendid way to lose a man.
--- Unknown ---
Just throw your knowledge in his face,
He’ll never try for second base.
Ninety-eight ways to go.
--- Unknown ---
The third way to lose a man --
The life-guard at the beach that all the girlies adore
Swims bravely out to save you through the ocean’s roar,
Don’t say, ‘oh, thanks, i would have drowned in just one second more.’
--- Unknown ---
Just push his head under water and yell,
‘Last one in is a rotten egg’ And race him back to shore!
--- Unknown ---
That’s a swell way to lose a man.
--- Unknown ---
You’ve found your perfect mate and it’s been love from the start.
He whispers, ‘you’re the one to who i give my heart.’
Don’t say, ‘i love you too, my dear, let’s never never part.’
--- Unknown ---
Just say, ‘i’m afraid you’ve made a grammatical error
It’s not ‘to who i give my heart,’ It's ‘to whom i give my heart’
You see, with the use of the preposition ‘to,’ ‘Who’ Becomes the indirect object,
Making the use of ‘whom’ Imperative which
I can easily show you by drawing a simple chart’
--- Unknown ---
That’s a fine way to lose a man.
--- Unknown ---
A fine fine fine fine way to lose a man,
A dandy way to lose a man.
--- Unknown ---
Just be more well-informed than he,
You’ll never hear ‘o, promise me.’
--- Unknown ---
Just show him where his grammar errs,
Then mark your towels ‘hers’ And ‘hers.’
--- Unknown ---
Yes, girls, you too can lose your man,
If you will use ruth sherwood’s plan:
One hundred easy ways to lose a man!
