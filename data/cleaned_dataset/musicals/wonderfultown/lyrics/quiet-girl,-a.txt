------ Quiet Girl, A ------
--- BAKER ---
All right! Goodbye!
You've taught me my lesson!
Get mixed up with a genius from Ohio!
It happens overand over
I pick the sharp intellectual kind
Why couldn't this time be different
Why couldn't she - only be
Another kind - A different kind of girl
--- Unknown ---
I love a quiet girl
I love a gentle girl
Warm as sunlight
Soft, soft as snow
--- Unknown ---
Her smile, a tender smile
Her voice, a velvet voice
Sweet as music
Soft, soft as snow
--- Unknown ---
When she is near me
The world's in repose
We need no words
She sees - she knows
--- Unknown ---
But where is my quiet girl
Where is my gentle girl
Where is the special girl
Who is soft, soft as snow
--- Unknown ---
Somewhere
Somewhere
My quiet girl

Somewhere

My quiet girl

(spoken)I know a quiet girl
--- Unknown ---
I know a quiet girl
Hoping - waiting -
But he'll never know
--- MUSIC BRIDGE ---
--- Unknown ---
I know a quiet girl
