------ My Darlin' Eileen ------
--- 4TH COP ---
Take it from me
In Dublin's fiar city
There's none half so pretty
As pretty Eileen
--- Unknown ---
Take it from me
The Mayor of Shannon
Would shoot off a cannon
And crown ye the queen
--- ALL COPS ---
Darlin' Eileen
Darlin' Eillen
Fairest colleen that ever I've seen
And it's oh I wish I were back
In the land of the green
With my Darlin' Eileen
--- GALJOUR ---
I've seen them all
There's Bridget and Sheila
--- KOLE ---
There's Kate and Deli...lah
And Moll and Maureen
--- ROBINSON ---
I've seen them all
Not one can compete with...
--- ANDERSON ---
Or share the same street with
My darlin' Eileen
--- ALL COPS ---
Darlin' Eileen
Darlin' Eillen
Fairest colleen that ever I've seen
And it's oh I wish I were back
In the land of the green
With my Darlin' Eileen
--- EILEEN ---
Listen my lads
I've something to tell you
I hope won't impel you to cry and to keen
Mother's a Swede and Father's a Scot...
And so Irish I'm not - And I never have been
--- ALL COPS ---
Hush you, Eileen!  Hush you, Eileen!
Fairest colleen that ever I've seen
Don't you hand us none of that blarney...
You come from Kilarney
