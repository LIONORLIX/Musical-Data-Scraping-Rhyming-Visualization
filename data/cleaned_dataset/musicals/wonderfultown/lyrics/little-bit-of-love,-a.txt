------ Little Bit Of Love, A ------
--- Unknown ---
Mm--mmm --
I’m a little bit in love,
Never felt this way before.
Mm--mmm --
Just a little bit in love,
Or perhaps a little bit more.
--- Unknown ---
When he
Looks at me,
Everything’s hazy and all out of focus.
When he
Touches me,
I’m in the spell of a strange hocus-pocus.
It’s so --
I don’t know.
I’m so --
I don’t know.
I don’t know -- but i know,
If it’s love,
Then it’s lovely!
--- Unknown ---
Mm--mmm --
It’s so nice to be alive
When you meet someone who bewitches you.
Will he be my all,
Or did i just fall
A little bit,
A little bit in love’
