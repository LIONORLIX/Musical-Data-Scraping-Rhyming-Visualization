------ Wrong Note Rag ------
--- Unknown ---
Oh there's a new sensation that is goin' around,
goin' around, goin' around, goin' around
A simple little ditty that is sweepin' the town,
sweepin' the town, sweepin' the town:
Doo doo doot, doo doo doot, doo doo doo doot, doo doo doot,
Doo doo doot, doo doo doot
Doo doo doot, doo doo doot, doo doo doo doot,
They call it the Wrong Note Rag!
--- Unknown ---
It's got a little twist that really drives you insane,
drives you insane, drives you insane, drives you insane
Because you find you never get it out of your brain,
out of your brain, out of your brain
Doo doo doot, doo doo doot, doo doo doo doot, doo doo doot, Doo doo doot, doo doo doot
Doo doo doot, doo doo doot, doo doo doo doot,
They call it the Wrong Note Rag!

Bunny Hug! Turkey Trot! Doin' the Wrong Note Rag!

Please play that lovely wrong note
Because that wrong note
Just makes me doo doo doot, doo doo doot, wah
That note is such a strong note
It makes me rick ricky tick, rick ricky tick tacky
Wick wicky wick, wick wicky wick wacky
--- Unknown ---
Don't play that right polite note
Because that right note
Just makes me blah blah blah blah, blah blah blah blah, no no
Give me that new and blue note and sister
Watch my dust!
Watch my smoke!
Doin' the Wrong Note Rag!

Doo doo doot, doo doo doot, doo doo doo doot, doo doo doot,
Doo doo doot, doo doo doot
Doo doo doot, doo doo doot, doo doo doo doot,
