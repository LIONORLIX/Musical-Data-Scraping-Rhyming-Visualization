------ Pass The Football ------
--- Unknown ---
Look at me now,
Four years of college,
Famous professors
Tutoring me;
--- Unknown ---
Scholarship kid,
Everything paid for,
Food and vacations,
All of it free.
--- Unknown ---
Day that i left,
Everyone gathered,
Their cheering still rings in my ears . . .
--- Unknown ---
Ray wreck rah!
Rah wreck ray!
Rah wreck!
Wreck rah!
Rah wreck wreck!
W-e-c, r-e-k, r-e-q,
Wreck, we love you!
--- Unknown ---
‘Cause i could pass that football
Like nothin’ You have ever seen!
--- Unknown ---
Couldn’t spell a lick,
Couldn’t do arithmetic;
One and one made three,
Thought that dog was c-a-t,
--- Unknown ---
But i could pass that football
Like nothin’ You have ever seen.
--- Unknown ---
Couldn’t write my name,
Couldn’t translate ‘je vous aime’,
Never learned to read
Mother goose or andr’ Gide,
--- Unknown ---
But i could pass that football
Like nothin’ You have ever seen.
--- Unknown ---
Couldn’t figure riddles,
Puzzles made me pout:
--- Unknown ---
Where the hell was moses when the lights went out’
I couldn’t even tell red from green,
Get those verbs through my bean,
But i was buddies with the dean
Like nothin’ You have ever seen.
--- Unknown ---
Passed without a fuss
English lit and calculus.
Never had to cram,
Even passed the bar exam,
--- Unknown ---
Because i passed that football
Like nothin’ You have ever seen.
--- Unknown ---
Couldn’t dance for beans,
Mashed my girls to smithereens.
Sometimes blood was spilled,
Still my card was always filled,
--- Unknown ---
‘Cause i could pass that football
Like nothin’ You have ever seen.
--- Unknown ---
Then there was the week
Albert einstein came to speak:
Relativity!
Guess who introduced him’ Me!
--- Unknown ---
‘Cause i could pass that football
Like nothin’ You have ever seen.
--- Unknown ---
Had no table manners,
Used ta dunk my roll,
Always drunk the water from the fingerbowl.
Though i would not get up for any she,
The prexy’s mom -- age ninety-three --
Got up and gave her seat to me,
Like nothin’ You did ever see.
--- Unknown ---
In our hall of fame,
There’s a statue with my name.
There we stand, by heck,
Lincoln, washington and wreck.
‘Cause i could pass that football
Like nothin’ You have ever seen!
