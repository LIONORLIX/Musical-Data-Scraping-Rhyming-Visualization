------ What Is He Waiting For? ------
--- NOAH, MAMA, HAM, SHEM, JAPETH, APHRA, AISHA ---
Forty days and forty nights come and gone
All the world is dead and drowned
Still the rain goes on
The is no peace or people anymore
What is he waiting for?
What is he waiting for?
--- Unknown ---
Forty day and forty nights black and bleak
And what rations we have left
Will not last the week
Papa calls and calls to God
--- NOAH ---
Why wont you speak?
--- ALL ---
Where is the sun he said he would restore?
What is he waiting for
--- NOAH ---
Father?
--- ALL ---
What is he waiting for?
