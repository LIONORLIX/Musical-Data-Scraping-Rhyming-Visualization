------ Hour of Darkness ------
--- NOAH ---
As we may know
Our end is very near
And God's priorities are no longer clear to me
And so i ask you
If all we've got
Is just this little ride
Here and now
Eveyrone of us
Reconcile
--- YONAH ---
In whatever time we have
--- Unknown ---
YONAH + JAPETH
For as long as we are living
--- Unknown ---
YONAH, JAPETH + MAMA
We can face whatever comes
--- Unknown ---
YONAH, JAPETH, MAMA + NOAH
If we face it now as one
--- Unknown ---
YONAH, JAPETH, MAMA, NOAH, HAM, SHEM, APHRA + AISHA
If there's silence in the sky
In a world without a future
We will swear to be together
In whatever time
We have
