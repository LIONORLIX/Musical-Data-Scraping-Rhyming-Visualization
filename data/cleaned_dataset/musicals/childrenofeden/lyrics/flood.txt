--- FATHER ---
This was the last chance i would give
Now it is corrupted, defyled and vain
Is there no escape from the race of Cain?
Except to let it rain and rain and rain!
--- STORYTELLERS ---
Windows of heaven
And fountains of the deep
Windows of heaven
And fountains of the deep
Open!
--- FATHER ---
Behold i will blot out mankind from the face of the earth
--- STORYTELLERS ---
Open!
--- FATHER ---
Both man and beats and every creeping thing
--- STORYTELLERS ---
Open!
--- FATHER ---
The end of all flesh has come before me
Rain!
--- STORYTELLERS ---
Rain!
--- FATHER ---
Untill the end of time
--- STORYTELLERS ---
Rain!
--- FATHER ---
And let the raging skies and the dark raging in this hurricane
--- STORYTELLERS ---
And let the raging skies
--- FATHER ---
I made everything
Out of nothing
--- STORYTELLERS ---
Everything
Of nothing
--- Unknown ---
FATHER + STORYTELLERs
Now nothing will remain
--- FATHER ---
And to the skies
--- STORYTELLERS ---
And to the skies
--- FATHER ---
I set my word
--- Unknown ---
FATHER + STORYTELLERS
No and forever will it rain!
--- FATHER ---
All my children that i love so well
My heart is dark and cold
I thought that you could keep my young
But you have made me old
All my labour
All my love
I wonder now
Why did i bother?
Thats what it means to be a father
I have destroyed the thing i love
and now i feel so old
--- STORYTELLERS ---
And the waters were upon the face of the earth
Drowning all the promise of that first hopeful birth
Without form
Void
Darkness
