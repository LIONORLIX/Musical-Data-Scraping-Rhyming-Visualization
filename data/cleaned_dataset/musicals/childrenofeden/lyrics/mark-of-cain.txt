------ Mark of Cain ------
--- FATHER ---
Cain! Cain!
The voice of your brother's blood
Cries to me from the ground
I curse that ground
And I curse you
--- Unknown ---
Be a fugative and a vegabond
All your wretched life
And should you find a wife
I curse her too
And all your tainted progeny
Your children's children's children
--- FATHER AND STORYTELLERS ---
Even to the seventh generation!
Let the righteous hear:
The seed of Cain with guilt and shame is ridden
All concourse with them is forever more forbidden
--- Unknown ---
Shun them like the scorpion and shark
And that you may know them
On Cain I set this mark.
--- Unknown ---
The race of Cain must ever bear this mark!
--- STORYTELLERS ---
The wild beast howl and the wild winds blow
And the seeds of the tree of knowledge grow
And you know things now you wish you didn't know
--- Unknown ---
In the wasteland...
In the wasteland...
