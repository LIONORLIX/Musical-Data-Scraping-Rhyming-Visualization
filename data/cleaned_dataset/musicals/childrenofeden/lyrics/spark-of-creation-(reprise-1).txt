------ Spark of Creation (Reprise 1) ------
--- EVE ---
I feel a coldness in the pit of my stomach
I feel a watchfulness in back of my eyes
I carry a load of heavy forboding I cannot explain
--- Unknown ---
My boys are healthy, they grow bigger and stronger
No sign of trouble, but I recognize
The heat and hunger of when I was younger
I see it now in Cain
--- Unknown ---
I used to think it was the spark of creation
Was it just a defect in me?
A flaw in my nature
And now look what I've done
I've passed it to my son
This wild inclination
