------ Father's Day ------
--- FATHER ---
Sleeping there like angels
Innocent and simple
I think she's got my nose
I think he's got my dimple
--- Unknown ---
In my own image
From my likeness are they sprung
They will keep me company
They will keep me young
--- Unknown ---
That's what it means to be a Father
Planning their future as you watch your children sleep
That's what it means to be a Father
I never knew that I could feel a love so deep
--- Unknown ---
Well I will be their teacher and I will be their guide
And anything they'll ever need I'll be there to provide
And in return, they'll love me
Stay forever at my side
That's what it means to be a Father
--- Unknown ---
For I have built a universe, spectacular and new
And I sat there in my universe and learned that this was true:
What use is a universe with no one to give it to?
Not a hill of beans
'Til you pass along your genes
