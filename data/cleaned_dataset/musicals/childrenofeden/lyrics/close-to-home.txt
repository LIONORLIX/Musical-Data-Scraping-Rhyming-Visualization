------ Close to Home ------
--- ADAM ---
All that I had to give, I gave that boy
Once he was young and once he brought my heart such joy
He'd ride my shoulders and 'cross the fields we'd roam
I still can see those moments like yesterday
I was a fool to think they'd make him want to stay
At home
--- YOUNG CAIN AND ABEL ---
One two three
Owls are in the tree
Four five six
Foxes in the sticks
Six five four
Goslings on the shore
Three two one
Now we all go home
--- Unknown ---
One two three
Owls are in the tree
Four five six
Foxes in the sticks
Six five four
Goslings on the shore
Three two one
Now we all go home
--- Unknown ---
ADAM (simultaneously)
It's time to make a home
Heaven knows the life's been hard
Summers brief and arid
Winters bleak and numb
--- Unknown ---
Look what we call home
These old walls are stained and scarred
--- EVE ---
I can still remember
What each scar was from
--- ADAM ---
You could call it run down
--- EVE ---
Worn out
--- ADAM ---
Threadbare
--- BOTH ---
And I guess you'd come
Close to home
Close to home
--- ADAM ---
And I remember, in someone else's garden long ago
We had all we could eat
--- EVE ---
But it seems the fruit our own hands grow
Somehow tastes twice as sweet
--- ABEL ---
Six five four
Goslings on the shore
Three two one
Now we all go home
--- ADAM ---
On this barren plot
--- ABEL ---
One two three
Owls are in the tree
--- ADAM ---
We'll plant our wheat and dig our well
--- ABEL ---
Four five six
Foxes in the sticks
--- ADAM ---
And we'll be a family
--- ABEL ---
Six five four
Goslings on the shore
--- ADAM ---
Steady as a star
--- EVE ---
Look at what we've got
--- ADAM AND ABEL ---
Ba ba bum, ba ba ba ba bum
--- EVE ---
Only what we've made ourselves
--- ADAM AND ABEL ---
Eight nine ten, now we start again
--- EVE ---
Though it's next to nothing
Look how rich we are
--- ADAM ---
Funny now how Eden doesn't seem so far
--- ADAM AND EVE ---
Come sit besides me in the dying light
What storms the morning brings, we'll weather all right
Your hand in my hand
And as we sit here, huddled in the gloom
Paradise seems strangely close
Close to home
--- ABEL ---
Ba ba bum, ba ba ba ba bum
--- ADAM AND EVE ---
Close to home
--- ABEL ---
Three two one
Now we all go
--- ADAM, EVE, AND ABEL ---
