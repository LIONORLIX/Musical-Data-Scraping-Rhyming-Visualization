------ Noah's Lullaby ------
--- STORYTELLERS ---
There they gathered
In the meadow
In the meadow two by two
The worlds most legendary
Zoo
--- NOAH ---
Children Of Eden
How you must blame us
We who are human
We spoilt your home
God made you our charges
We made you our victims
Now we're starting a new
Can we give Eden back to you?
