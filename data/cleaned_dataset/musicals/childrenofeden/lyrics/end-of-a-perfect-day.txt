------ End of a Perfect Day ------
--- WOMAN ---
And the woman did eat
And her eyes were opened
--- SECOND WOMAN ---
Through her tears, she saw the beauty all around her
--- BOTH ---
At the end of a perfect day
--- STORYTELLERS ---
Nothing was different
And nothing would ever be the same
It was the end of a perfect day
