------ Perfect (Part 2) ------
--- STORYTELLERS ---
And the night was perfect
And their dreams were perfect
And they woke with the dawn
And smiled with a yawn
At one another
--- Unknown ---
And with a gentle kiss
They soon discovered this
Their love was more than sister and brother
--- FATHER ---
Well, after all they were made for each other
--- ADAM AND EVE ---
Of all this perfect garden's perfect sights
You are the sweetest of my earthly delights
--- STORYTELLERS ---
And their love was perfect
And the day was perfect
And the next was perfect
And the next...was perfect
--- Unknown ---
And the day after that
And the day after that
Each one perfect as could be
--- WOMEN ---
Perfect as could ever be
--- Unknown ---
MEN (simultaneously)
And as the days went by
Though she could not say why
--- STORYTELLERS ---
The woman went to spy on the curious tree
And she'd stand there all hesitant and hovering
And each day she drew closer
Until she made an oh!
Surprising and bewildering discovery
--- EVE ---
Come, Adam, quick, Adam, wait 'til I show you what I found!
--- ADAM ---
Not now, dear, I'm trying to put the insects into alphabetical order. Ant...aphid...
--- EVE ---
No, Adam! Now, Adam!
It's a thing that will astound you!
When I show you what I found, you won't believe
--- ADAM ---
Eve!
--- STORYTELLERS ---
And she brought him to the tree
