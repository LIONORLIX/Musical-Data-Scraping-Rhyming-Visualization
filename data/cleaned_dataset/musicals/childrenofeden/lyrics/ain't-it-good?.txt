Thank God the stars are still in the sky
I thought they drowned with everything else
--- Unknown ---
Oh look out there
In the eastern sky
Is that a hint of light
Oh come and look
I need to know
If I am seeing right
We lived so long in dark
I'm almost frightened to believe
Those clearing skies on
That glistening horizon please
Tell me my eyes
Do not decieve me
--- Unknown ---
Ain't it sweet
To smell the morning
In a world washed fresh and clean
Now the storm has left it's warning
And we see, we see a hint of green
Pale grey light
Grow strong and golden
And release us from our pen
Where we rocked for endless days
On a sea of endless greys
Now we sing a song of praise, Amen
Ain't it good
Ain't it good now
Ain't it good to see the sun again

When my ears
Were filled with thunder
And when my soul
Began to shake
There were times
I'd truly wonder
If those clouds
Would ever break
But no storm
Would last forever
Though we felt
So helpless then
Now we raise a joyful chant
For a glimpse of olive plant
Haven't seen one since I can't
I can't remember when
Aint' good
Oh ain't it good
Our hearts are dancing
Hopes
Since
We got a second chance
--- Unknown ---
And for now
We are done with fearing
We might be
The final generation
In a dawn that's new and fresh
Open wide this floating tress
And deliver
Every precious speciamin
Ain't it good now
Ain't it good to see the sun again
My Lord
--- Unknown ---
After all the nights we stood
Smelling rain and gopher wood
To see the sun again!

When my ears
They were filled thunder
And my soul, and when my soul began to shake
There were times
I would truly wonder
Those dark and gloomy rain clouds
If those clouds would ever break
But there's no storm
No storm can last forever
We felt so helpless then
--- Unknown ---
Can't remember when it felt so good
When skies are clearing
Now our hearts begin to dance
And now our hopes are reappearing
Since we've been granted a second chance
And for now
We are done with fearing
We thought we'd be the final generation
In a dawn
Open wide
And deliver

Brother ain't it good
Oh ain't good
Ain't good
Ain't it good to see the sun again
My Lord
Ain't it good
Oh ain't it good
