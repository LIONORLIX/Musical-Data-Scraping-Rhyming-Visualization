------ Children of Eden ------
--- EVE ---
--- Unknown ---
Like this brief day
My light is nearly gone
But through the night
My children you will go on
You will know heartache
Prayers that don't work
And times of bitter circumstances
But I still believe in second chances
--- Unknown ---
Children of Eden
Where have we left you
Born to uncertaity
Destined for pain
Sins of your parents
Haunt you and test you
This your inheritence
Fire and rain
--- Unknown ---
Children of Eden
Try not to blame us
We were just human to error prone
Children of Eden will you reclaim us
You and your children to come
Someday you'll come home
--- Unknown ---
STORYTELLERS and EVE
--- Unknown ---
Children of eden
Where is our garden
Where is the innocence
We can't reclaim
Once eyes are opened
Must those eyes harden
Lost in the wilderness
Must we remain
--- EVE ---
--- Unknown ---
Oh my precious children
If you think of us try not to blame us
We were just human to error prone
[STORYTELLERS join] Children of Eden you will reclaim us
You and your children to come
