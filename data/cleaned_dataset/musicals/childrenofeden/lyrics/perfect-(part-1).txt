------ Perfect (Part 1) ------
--- FATHER ---
CHILDREN OF EDEN,
HERE IS YOUR GARDEN.
LIVE IN CONTENTMENT;
THIS IS YOUR HOME…
--- ADAM ---
It’s wonderful! It’s beautiful! It’s…
It’s…
--- EVE ---
It’s perfect!
--- FATHER ---
Exactly.
--- STORYTELLERS ---
AND THE GRASS WAS PERFECT,
AND THE SKY WAS PERFECT,
AND THE BARK OF THE TREES WAS DAPPLED AND ROUGH…
BUT NOT TOO ROUGH ..
AND WHERE THERE WAS A CLOUD,
THE ONLY CLOUD ALLOWED
WAS FLEECY, WHITE,
AND JUST ASYMMETRIC ENOUGH.
--- AND AS FOR PERFECT NAMES, ---
OF COURSE THEY HAD ‘EM…
--- FATHER ---
I DO BELIEVE
I’LL CALL YOU… “EVE”…
EVE
AND WHO'S HE?
--- ADAM ---
MADAM, I’M ADAM!
--- EVE ---
Father?
--- FATHER ---
Yes?
--- EVE ---
What’s that?
--- FATHER ---
Where?
--- ADAM ---
There. the water sort of… falls out of the rocks.
--- FATHER ---
Oh, that. It’s called a “waterfall.”
--- ADAM ---
A “waterfall?”
--- FATHER ---
Yes…
… You see, the water comes gushing out…
--- EVE ---
No, no, not that!
That!
--- FATHER ---
Oh, that! That’s a hill.
ADAM
It’s very high up.
--- FATHER ---
As close as I could get it to the stars.
--- EVE ---
No, no, no! On top of the hill.
--- FATHER ---
Oh… that… It’s just a tree.
--- EVE ---
But it’s glistening.
--- FATHER ---
No, it’s not! Is it?
--- ADAM ---
Well, it is glistening a bit.
--- FATHER ---
Yes, well… er… that would be the fruit.
--- EVE ---
Why is the fruit glistening?
--- FATHER ---
Well…
--- EVE ---
Is it a special kind of a tree?
--- ADAM ---
Eve… I don’t think you should ask so many questions.
--- EVE ---
Why not?
--- FATHER ---
All right! Look! It’s called the Tree of Knowledge. And whether the fruit is
glistening or not…
--- EVE ---
Well, it is…
--- FATHER ---
All right! It’s glistening. The fruit is glistening. It’s also very, very bad for you,
and you must never, ever eat it. Or even touch it. Understand?
--- ADAM ---
It’s all right, Father. We won’t touch it.
--- EVE ---
Why not?
--- FATHER ---
You don’t need to know that…
--- EVE ---
Why not?
--- FATHER ---
Children! If you love me, if you love this family, you will never eat of that fruit.
Either of you.
--- ADAM ---
We promise, Father.
Eve…
--- EVE ---
We promise.
--- FATHER ---
Thank you.
--- EVE ---
But if it isn’t good for us, Father, why did you put it here?
