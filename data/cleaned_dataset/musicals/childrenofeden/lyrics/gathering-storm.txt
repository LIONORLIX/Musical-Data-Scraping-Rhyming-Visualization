------ Gathering Storm ------
--- NOAH ---
I know we've been through this before
I know your weary of my asking
But one time more i stand imploring you
I know you have just cause
With all the faults and flaws of human kind
But i think of all the souls with dreams and such
And i try to be resigned
But i wish you'd change your mind
I wish you'd change your mind
--- FATHER ---
I've watched and waited sinse the time of Seth
And hoped as each new generation drew its breath
I've hoped forever
Now may my earth be filled
With good and grateful children i've hoped in vain
Cruel, greedy, violent, they're all the race of Cain
Now only you and your family remain
--- Unknown ---
This is the last time i will hope
This is the last chance i will give
I will let your family live
But this is the last chance i will give!
