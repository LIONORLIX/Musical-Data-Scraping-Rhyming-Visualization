Do you remember the first time you fell in love?
Did it make you happy or sad?
Did you waste away and lie awake all night?
--- ALEX ---
Yes, I remember...
I cannot forget...
It's haunted my life since then...
--- JENNY ---
Pas de tendresse
Et pas de joie,
Loin d'ici,
Loin de toi.
--- Unknown ---
Rien de plus triste
Que mes soupirs,
Lorsque vient le jour
O? il me faut partir...
--- ALEX ---
How do you know that?
--- JENNY ---
Mummy used to sing it to me.
That was her love song.
Her very first love song...
--- Unknown ---
Love,
Love changes everything:
How you feel and
What you do...
--- Unknown ---
What...
What would you say to me,
If I told you
I loved you...?
--- Unknown ---
ALEX (with difficulty)
Then I'd have to say to you:
You are bright and sweet and foolish...
Yes, love,
Love changes everything,
But not always
For the best --
Love can sometimes
Be a most
Unwelcome guest...
--- JENNY ---
You don't believe that.
You know you're fooling yourself.
Why not be honest?

Alex,
