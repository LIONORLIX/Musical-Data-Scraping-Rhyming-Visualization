------ Other Pleasures ------
--- GEORGE ---
Other pleasures...
And I've known many...
Afternoons
In warm Venetian squares,
Brief encounters,
Long siestas...
Pleasures old and new
Can't compare with you.
--- Unknown ---
You amaze me!
Where did you come from?
You do things
Champagne could never do.
Crystal winters,
Crimson summers...
Other pleasures --
I would trade them all
For you.
--- Unknown ---
Pleasures old and new
Can't compare with you...
--- Unknown ---
Wild mimosa...
The scent of evening...
Shuttered rooms
With sunlight breaking through...
Crazy soir?es...
Lazy Sundays...
Other pleasures...
I would trade them all
For you.
--- Unknown ---
Sailing off
In the night
On a silver lake...
Taking more
From this life
Than I ought to take...
Other pleasures...
I would trade them all
For you.

Good Lord!
The time!
For once she's managed
To arrive ahead of schedule!

ROSE (to JENNY, producing a gift-wrapped present)
Wait till you see
What I've got for you,
Darling.

And wait till you see
What I've got for you...

I don't believe this...

ROSE (echoing him)
I don't believe this...

GEORGE (struggling with his emotions)
Good God, I wondered what had happened to you!
Rose, you really should have let me know!
--- Unknown ---
Dear boy, you must meet Jenny!
--- ALEX ---
Hello, cousin.
Nice to meet you.

So you're the soldier?

This is Alex.
You remember.

Yes, of course.

ROSE (to GEORGE)
He saw my last performance.

She really was phenomenal.

A truly blazing star!

Rose, you're a wonder!

All the dreams we've worked for
