------ There is More to Love ------
--- GIULIETTA ---
There is more to love,
So much more,
Than simply making love --
That's easy.
--- Unknown ---
Gazing into eyes,
Pretty eyes,
Which could be any eyes --
That's crazy.
--- Unknown ---
Hands are just hands,
A face is just a face...
They come and go --
They're easy to replace...
--- Unknown ---
There is more to love,
So much more,
Than moon-struck escapades --
That's nothing.
--- Unknown ---
There is peace of mind,
So much peace,
In quiet company --
That's something.
--- Unknown ---
Everyone but him
Seems wrong for me...
Every time I feel
There has to be
More...
--- Unknown ---
If I could hear
The music I heard then,
I'd never let
It fade away again...
--- Unknown ---
Now each time
Love reaches out to me,
I can only feel
There has to be
So much more
To love...
--- Unknown ---
There is more ot love,
