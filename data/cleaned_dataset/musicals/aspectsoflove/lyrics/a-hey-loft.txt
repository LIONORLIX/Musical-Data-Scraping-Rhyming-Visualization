------ A Hey Loft ------
--- GIULIETTA ---
What was that?
--- Unknown ---
ALEX (sitting up)
What?
--- GIULIETTA ---
There.
Listen.
--- Unknown ---
ALEX (gets up and looks around)
There's nothing there.  I suppose it must have been a rat.
--- GIULIETTA ---
So what do you propose to do, then?
Get married while she's still at school?
Tell her now.
Don't be cruel.
--- ALEX ---
There has to be a way to say it...
Common sense can be so cold...
--- GIULIETTA ---
Common sense
Says: be bold...
--- ALEX ---
Yes, it's a crime to make her love me --
But surely, it's just as bad to leave her...
And yet, that can be the only answer --
The whole damn thing's got out of hand...
--- GIULIETTA ---
The only crime that I'm aware of
Would be to let our moment die --
Tell her now.
Tell her why.
--- Unknown ---
"A memory of a happy moment,
That's what this time will one day be --
Tell her that.
Then you're free.
--- ALEX ---
Will you still be here when I get back?
--- GIULIETTA ---
