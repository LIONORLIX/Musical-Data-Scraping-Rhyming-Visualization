------ The House in Pau ------
--- ALEX ---
Wish my arms were longer...
Or the gap was wider...
One more go and
That should do it...
One more try and there --
That does it!
--- ROSE ---
You will rue the day
That you got me in this mess!
I've torn my one good dress!
You're really a charmer!
--- ALEX ---
Rose, I know this seems
Like a scene from Modern Times...
--- Unknown ---
The house is my uncle's --
All right, I was lying --
He's working in Paris,
He won't come here prying...
Oh Rose,
Rose, can't you see?
I would have said anything
To get you here with me...
--- Unknown ---
Shall I make some coffee...?
--- ROSE ---
One cup of fresh coffee
Buys two kisses --
Shall we have dinner?
--- BOTH ---
Whatever happens,
We have this moment.
Who needs tomorrow,
When we have today?
Tonight we'll mean
The things we say
Forever...
--- Unknown ---
Seeing is believing!
My life is just beginning!
We touched,
And my head
Won't stop spinning
From winning
