------ George's House at Pau ------
--- JENNY ---
I think by now I'm old enough
To put myself to bed.
Why don't you go and forge
Another masterpiece instead?
--- GEORGE ---
Oh, Jenny, you're a monster!
I should have had a son!
It seems, alas, a father's lot...
--- Unknown ---
BOTH (she chiming in, as it is a line she has heard often before)
...Is not a happy one!
--- JENNY ---
You know I need my donkey.
--- GEORGE ---
Why can't you just count sheep?
--- Unknown ---
All right, you have your donkey --
Now will you go to sleep?
--- JENNY ---
I'm really thrilled for Mummy!
Weren't they wonderful reviews?
She'll be the toast of Paris!
Mummy's always in the news!
--- GEORGE ---
You're right, it is amazing
How the work keeps flooding in,
With appearances in London
And movies in Berlin.
--- JENNY ---
Now off you go to bed --
I'll wake you when I hear the car!
--- GEORGE ---
Look, Jenny, go to bed --
God, what a chatterbox you are!
--- Unknown ---
Jenny,
You're a miracle!
Is there nothing you conceal?
Jenny,
You astonish me!
Never hiding
