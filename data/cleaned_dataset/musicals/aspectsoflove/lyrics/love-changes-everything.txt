------ Love Changes Everything ------

Love,
Love changes everything:
Hands and faces,
Earth and sky,
Love,
Love changes everything:
How you live and
How you die
--- Unknown ---
Love
Can make the summer fly,
Or a night
Seem like a lifetime.
--- Unknown ---
Yes, Love,
Love changes everything:
Now I tremble
At your name.
Nothing in the
World will ever
Be the same.
--- Unknown ---
Love,
Love changes everything:
Days are longer,
Words mean more.
Love,
Love changes everything:
Pain is deeper
Than before.
--- Unknown ---
Love
Will turn your world around,
And that world
Will last for ever.
--- Unknown ---
Yes, Love,
Love changes everything,
Brings you glory,
Brings you shame.
Nothing in the
World will ever
Be the same.

Why did I go back to see her...?

Alex, it's all in the past...
--- ALEX ---
Off
Into the world we go,
Planning futures,
Shaping years.
Love,
Bursts in, and suddenly
All our wisdom
Disappears.
--- Unknown ---
Love
Makes fools of everyone:
All the rules
We make are broken.
--- Unknown ---
Yes, Love,
Love changes everyone.
Live or perish
In its flame.
Love will never,
Never let you
------ fin ------
