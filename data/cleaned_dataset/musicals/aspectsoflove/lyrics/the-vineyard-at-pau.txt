------ The Vineyard at Pau ------
--- Unknown ---
LABORER 1
Now that's what I call a wall!
--- Unknown ---
LABORER 2
It's a masterpiece!
--- ALEX ---
It's Picasso!
--- JENNY ---
Except it's straight...
--- GEORGE ---
Hugo, we should call you Samson!
--- JENNY ---
He has many talents.
--- Unknown ---
GEORGE (to ALEX)
How you didn't break your back I'll never know!
--- ALEX ---
No, nor will I!
--- HUGO ---
Thank God for Sundays!
--- Unknown ---
ALEX (appraising their work)
Not bad for one day's work.
--- ALL ---
Our wall will be the talk of Pau!
--- ROSE ---
Two more days, then off to Paris.
--- ALEX ---
And a school for Jenny.
--- HUGO ---
Didn't Jenny look a picture in that dress?
--- ALEX ---
Indeed she did.
--- GEORGE ---
So like her mother...
Shades of another time...
Of vintage nights --
--- Unknown ---
But I digress...
--- Unknown ---
Good Lord, the time!
Ah well, God bless...
--- ROSE ---
Alex, this has gone on long enough --
What I mean is you and Jenny.
--- Unknown ---
HUGO (leaving)
I'll be off now...
See you both tomorrow...
--- ROSE ---
Since you came, she's truly blossomed --
But, my friend, a flower is fragile...
Heaven help you if you hurt her...
--- ALEX ---
Why all this concern?
God, you're hardly ever here!
Your whole life is your career,
And nothing else matters.
--- ROSE ---
My career?
We wouldn't eat if I had no career.
You know that George lost everything.
I do it all for George and Jenny.
I thought you knew that.
--- ALEX ---
All right, I'm sorry.
--- ROSE ---
Can't you see?
What we three have is something very rare.
In a word, it's happiness.
Nothing in the world will ever
Tear apart the sweet existence
We have spent a lifetime building!
--- ALEX ---
Rose, let me explain to you...
Yes, I can't deny the feelings that I have...
But what's wrong with that?
--- Unknown ---
Rose, I'd never harm the girl...
--- ROSE ---
You were once prepared to do
A lot of harm to me...
--- ALEX ---
You cannot compare
This with our insane affair...
What I wanted from you
Was both body and soul...
--- ROSE ---
Aren't you trying to play
An identical role?
--- Unknown ---
ALEX (face to face)
