------ In Many Rooms in the House at Pau ------
--- ROSE ---
This is what I ought to feel on stage...
Soaring up like snow-capped mountains...
I feel your beauty and your rage...
I could be those tumbling forests,
I could play those jagged hillsides...
Star of mountain,
Star of valley...
--- ALEX ---
Would Madam care for breakfast?
Will croissants and fresh coffee do?
--- Unknown ---
Wonderful view!
Whenever we see those mountains,
We will think of me and you...
--- Unknown ---
George insists on magnificent views.
--- ROSE ---
I think I should like your uncle...
--- ROSE ---
Alex, she's beautiful.  Who is she?
--- ALEX ---
My aunt Delia.  She was an actress too.
--- ROSE ---
Delia!  Was she famous?
--- ALEX ---
Yes.  But she died very young.  That's why my uncle doesn't
come down here very often.  Too many memories.
--- ROSE ---
Haven't I seen that somewhere before?
--- ALEX ---
Not the one you're thinking of.  That's in the Louvre.
George did that one.  Some people call it fraud, but he prefers to
think of it as a tribute.
--- Unknown ---
ALEX (brandishing a rapier)
En garde!
--- Unknown ---
ROSE (parrying with a tennis racket)
Fifteen love!
--- BOTH ---
Promise me today will never ever end!
--- Unknown ---
ROSE (pulling out various tins)
Caviar!  Anchovies!  Peaches in brandy!  We can have a banquet tonight!
--- ALEX ---
When he does get down here, George doesn't believe in having to rough it.
--- BOTH ---
I could get to like it here!
Let's not ever think of leaving!
--- ALEX ---
Look at this.  Pierrot.  Carmen.
--- Unknown ---
For the ballroom?  Or the bedroom?
--- ROSE ---
M?rim?e, L'Occasion.  I know this -- it's a wonderful play!
--- ALEX ---
Really?
--- ROSE ---
Let's do it.  You can be the priest, I'll be Do?a Maria Colemenares.
--- ALEX ---
But I don't know anything about the theatre.
--- ROSE ---
I'll teach you.  We'll do it.  Tonight.
--- ALEX ---
What are you doing?  Pull yourself together...
--- ROSE ---
This one is gorgeous!
--- Unknown ---
ALEX (looking up)
It was her favorite dress...
--- ROSE ---
He must have loved her so much.
--- ALEX ---
Rose, leave things as they are...
--- ROSE ---
I can just see her...
