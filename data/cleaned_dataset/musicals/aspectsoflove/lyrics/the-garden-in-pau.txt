GEORGE (to ALEX)
I trust you're staying for the vintage?
--- Unknown ---
JENNY (to GEORGE)
Oh, he mustn't miss it!
--- ROSE ---
Alex, promise me you won't run off just yet!
--- JENNY ---
There's lots of room!
--- Unknown ---
ALEX (shrugs and smiles)
I'm in no hurry --
If it won't worry you...
This could be something you'll regret!
--- ROSE ---
Oh, no!
That's really disappointing!
--- GEORGE ---
What on earth's the matter?
--- ROSE ---
Giulietta won't be with us this weekend.
--- GEORGE ---
What's happened now?
--- ROSE ---
Same situation.
--- GEORGE ---
That girl's relationships
Are too involved to comprehend!
--- ALEX ---
Looks like I'll never meet your friend.
--- Unknown ---
GEORGE (rising)
One day you will, old chap.
--- Unknown ---
It's time I took my nap.
--- Unknown ---
Good Lord, the time has really flown!
--- ROSE ---
I'd better run along.
You'll have to manage on your own!
--- Unknown ---
ALEX (to himself)
Part of me was always in these hills...
This is where my eyes were opened...
When life was young and we had time...
I wonder why she brought me back here...
Why invite me?
Why entice me?
