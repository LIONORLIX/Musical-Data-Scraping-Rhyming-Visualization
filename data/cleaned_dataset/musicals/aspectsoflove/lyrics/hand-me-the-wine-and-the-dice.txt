------ Hand Me the Wine And the Dice ------
--- GIULIETTA ---
George was an original man.
He did not want to change human life.
He rejoiced in the way we are made.
He rejoiced in the way we are made.
He did not look forward to heaven --
He was happy with the earth.
He loved and understood
The flesh, food, wine, love...
He lived for today and firmly believed:
--- Unknown ---
If death were given a voice,
That voice would scream through the sky:
Live while you may for I am coming...
--- Unknown ---
So...
--- Unknown ---
Hand me the wine and the dice,
I want my carnival now,
While I have thirst and lust for living!
--- Unknown ---
So gather all you can reap,
Before you're under the plough --
The hand of death is unforgiving!
--- Unknown ---
Hand me the wine and the dice,
While there are grapes on the vine --
Life is a round of endless pleasures!
--- Unknown ---
The end is always in sight,
But it tastes better with wind --
Why pay your life in tiny measures?
--- Unknown ---
Hand me the wine and the dice,
The time is racing away --
There's not a taste that's not worth trying!
--- Unknown ---
And if tommorow it ends,
I won't have wasted today --
