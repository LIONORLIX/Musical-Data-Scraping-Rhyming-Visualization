------ A Cafe in Venice ------
--- GUILIETTA ---
Big surprise:
I can't be with you this weekend.
But don't be cross --
You should thank me.
You wouldn't find me much fun.
It seems my life is one enormous drama!
Men are such a dreadful nuisance...
I'll call you when I'm me again.
C'est la vie,
------ fin ------
