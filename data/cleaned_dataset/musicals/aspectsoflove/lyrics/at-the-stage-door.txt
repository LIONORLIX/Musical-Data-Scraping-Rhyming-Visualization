------ At the Stage Door ------
--- Unknown ---
ROSE (looking up at the posters)
Have I changed?
--- ALEX ---
No, not at all.
--- ROSE ---
You're too polite.
This face has had its day.
--- ALEX ---
Don't be so silly!
--- ROSE ---
Is it General Alex yet?
--- ALEX ---
I hardly think so.
--- ROSE ---
Two weeks without a script or camera!
I can't believe it!
And then another madcap movie...
--- Unknown ---
With Monsieur Cocteau...
George is sweet.
He says I'm like his favorite Juran?on:
Very strong and beautiful --
But hardly very sweet or subtle,
and not too heady...
--- ALEX ---
His head must be extremely strong, then --
I'm drunk already!
--- Unknown ---
What a life!
--- ROSE ---
You're telling me!
--- ALEX ---
What does Jenny make of all this fame?
--- ROSE ---
Ask her yourself.
--- ALEX ---
Do you think I ought to come?
--- ROSE ---
My darling, you've become so bourgeois --
We'll have to change that!
--- Unknown ---
The same old Alex...
I should be flattered...
You're never one to let a chance slip by...
--- ALEX ---
I'll never understand you till the day I die...
--- BOTH ---
