------ Anything But Lonely ------
--- ROSE ---
Anything but lonely,
Anything but empty rooms.
There's so much in life to share --
What's the sense when no one else is there?
--- Unknown ---
Anything but lonely,
Anything but only me.
Quiet years in too much space:
That's the thing that's hard to face,
And...
--- Unknown ---
You have a right to go,
But you should also know
That I won't be alone for long.
Long days with nothing said
Are not what lie ahead --
I'm sorry, but I'm not that strong.
--- Unknown ---
Anything but lonely,
Anything but passing time.
Lonely's what I'll never be,
While there's still some life in me,
And...
--- Unknown ---
I'm still young, don't forget,
It isn't over yet --
So many hearts for me to thrill.
--- Unknown ---
If you're not here to say
How good I look each day,
I'll have to find someone who will.
--- Unknown ---
Anything but lonely,
Anything but empty rooms.
There's so much in life to share --
What's the sense when no one else is
there...?
--- Unknown ---
Just promise one thing.
--- ALEX ---
All right.
What is it?
--- ROSE ---
Don't ask me questions...
You must promise first...
--- ALEX ---
I can't
I must know what it is.
