------ The First Man You Remember ------
--- GEORGE ---
I want to be
The first man you remember,
I want to be
The last man you forget.
I want to be
The one you always turn to,
I want to be
The one you won't regret.
May I be first
To say you look delightful?
May I be first
To dance you round the floor?
The very first
To see your face by moonlight?
The very first
To walk you to your door?
--- Unknown ---
JENNY: (playing to George)
Well, young man, I'd be delighted!
There is nothing I would rather do!
What could be a sweeter memory
Than sharing my first dance with you?
--- GEORGE ---
I want to be
The first man you remember...
--- JENNY ---
The very first
To sweep me off my feet.
--- GEORGE ---
I want to be
The one you always turn to...
--- JENNY ---
The first to make
My young heart miss a beat.
--- Unknown ---
(He gently takes her in a dance hold and they tentatively try a few steps around the terrace)
--- GEORGE ---
Seems the stars are far below us...
--- JENNY ---
The moon has never felt so close before...
--- Unknown ---
(looking up at George)
Our first dance will be forever...
--- GEORGE ---
And may it lead to many more!
I want to be
The first man you remember...
--- JENNY ---
The very first
To sweep me off my feet.
--- GEORGE ---
I want to be
The one you always turn to
--- JENNY ---
The first to make
My young heart miss a beat.
--- Unknown ---
(Once again they 'take to the floor', this time in a fuller, more formal dance.
The atmosphere is dreamlike and beguiling, and Rose and Hugo are drawn into the dance.
Alex declines Jenny's attempts to draw him into the dance as well.
At the end of the sequence George leads Jenny back to his seat and the dance dissolves)
--- GEORGE ---
I want to be
The one you always turn to
I want to be
The one you won't regret...
--- GEORGE AND JENNY ---
The very first...
