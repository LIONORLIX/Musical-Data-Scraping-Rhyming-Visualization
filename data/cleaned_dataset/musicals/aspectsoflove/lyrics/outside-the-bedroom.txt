ROSE (offstage)
What was that?
--- Unknown ---
ALEX (offstage)

ALEX (himself a little scared)
Don't be silly.  I'll go and have a look.
--- Unknown ---
ROSE (from inside)
Well?

ALEX (covering his misgivings)
There's nothing there.  I suppose it must have been a rat.
--- ROSE ---
I can't sleep in a house full of rats!

ALEX (following)
Well, I don't want you to sleep just yet...
--- ROSE ---
Alex.  Not now.
--- ALEX ---
Rose, where are you?

So crisp and clear!

--- Unknown ---
Let's breathe some mountain air!
--- ALEX ---
I thought you'd left me...
--- Unknown ---

--- ALEX ---
I had a dream you'd left me...
--- ROSE ---
Good idea?
