------ At the House at Pau ------
--- ROSE ---
Marcel wants me in Lyon...
He says that I'm needed today...
--- ALEX ---
Well, it must be important...
--- ROSE ---
I won't go.
I don't want to.
I'll ignore it.
--- Unknown ---
How can I desert you?
It's all so unfair,
So unfeeling!
--- ALEX ---
How can you say that?
Don't be a fool, Rose!
You can't put me before your whole career!
You can't let feelings interfere --
You must go!
--- ROSE ---
I'll pick up my script and my dress.
--- ALEX ---
A memory of a happy moment --
That's what this week will one day be...
George...you're wrong...
--- Unknown ---
Marcel -- how could he have known where she was?
Unless she told him...or sent this herself....  And there was I,
completely taken in, when she was going all along...
--- Unknown ---
No, she couldn't...
