------ Stop. Wait. Please. ------
--- GEORGE ---
...And then with a swift karate-chop
I removed his gun --
You should have been there!
Poor chap didn't know what hit him...
--- Unknown ---
GIULIETTA (interrupting)
Still, George!
If you can't keep your tongue still,
You will have the face of Edith Sitwell!
--- GEORGE ---
Ah well, they're happy...
It's for the best anyway...
Let's face it,
He's the man for her,
And I'm the man for you, dear...
--- GIULIETTA ---
Don't talk such nonsense --
You'll never stop loving her.
You don't fool me:
You're quite besotted with her...
--- Unknown ---
Stop.  Wait.  Good.  Please...
Still, George...
--- GEORGE ---
With my scarf I made a tourniquet --
Shantung silk, but worth the sacrifice --
It stemmed the flow, the arm was saved, and...
--- GIULIETTA ---
Still, George,
Rose would seem the kind of lady
Who would live through any blood-bath...
--- GEORGE ---
Darling, it's over --
So don't be so cynical.
I don't suppose that you've become a nun
Since last I saw you...
--- GIULIETTA ---
Wouldn't you love that!
Perpetual chastity!
--- GEORGE ---
So tell me,
Have you found some young Adonis?
--- Unknown ---
GIULIETTA (back to work again)
Stop.  Wait.  Good.  Please...
--- Unknown ---
No, George.
--- BOTH ---
Time and light are fading --
Shouldn't we make the most of
Every precious moment?
Life is sweet and slow and still and...
--- VOICES ---
I'm not leaving here till I get what I came for...it's a
scandal...out of my way...heaven help him if he won't
pay...who are you pushing...I got here first...all I want
is what's fair...he had better be there...
--- Unknown ---
GEORGE (over the voices)
For heaven's sake!
Who's making all that mayhem?
--- Unknown ---
MARCEL (to GEORGE)
Thank God you're here!
We've got trouble with Rose --
--- Unknown ---
HOTELIER (to MARCEL)
Are you certain that
This is the man?
Running up bills
Wherever she goes!
Is he the one
Footing the bill?
This is the man I was
Looking for,
--- Unknown ---
Is this the man?
This is your man!
DOCTOR (to MARCEL)
Can you be certain that
This is the man?
Is this the right man?
--- Unknown ---
CASHIER (to HOTELIER) This is the man
Who will pay for
The eighty-one phone calls!
--- Unknown ---
I beg of you, pay!
My poor mother is dying!
--- Unknown ---
HOTELIER (to GEORGE)
She loses her job if
These bills don't get settled!
If I lose my job, then...
PHARMACIST (to DOCTOR)
This is the man
Who will pay for
The codeine and dressings!
--- Unknown ---
DOCTOR (to GEORGE)
I've called the police, there
We'll call the police if...
--- Unknown ---
Are eight in the lobby!
CASHIER
The Doge's Suite!
HOTELIER
DOCTOR & PHARMACIST
Beluga caviar!
Twenty thousand lire!
GONDOLIER
You are the man,
I understand,
Who can clear my expenses.
Here they are:
Thirty thousand lire! CASHIER
Forty thousand!
HOTELIER
Fifty thousand!
--- Unknown ---
GEORGE (counting)
DOCTOR & PHARMACIST
Nineteen...
Twenty thousand lire!
GIULIETTA (counting)
GONDOLIER
Twenty-three...
Thirty thousand lire!
GEORGE & GIULIETTA
Forty-eight...
CASHIER
Forty thousand!
Forty-nine...
HOTELIER
Fifty thousand!
MARCEL
George, I'm sorry...She's been very ill.
--- ROSE ---
George...George...
My life is draining...
Away...
--- Unknown ---
MARCEL (backing out, to GEORGE)
We'd best be on our way --
We'll leave you three alone...
--- GIULIETTA ---
So this is Rose Vibert.
The famous Rose Vibert.
--- GEORGE ---
I have to talk to her.
Sit down and talk to her.
This can't go on another day.
--- Unknown ---
Rose, what can I do with you?
Wreaking havoc left and right --
It's absurd!
She must change her ways,
She must pass this passing phase --
Problem child...
Running wild...
--- Unknown ---
Rose, I ought to strangle you!
But there's a style about that girl
That stops me in my tracks.
Heaven knows why she
Wants to waste her life with me...
--- Unknown ---
And yet if she went off,
If she set herself free,
As I've told her she should...
Where on earth would I be?
--- GIULIETTA ---
You'd be lost, my friend,
And so would she...
--- ROSE ---
...And he said to me
He really ought to buy that vineyard...
--- GIULIETTA ---
Please, Rose.
Don't you think you ought
To take a little rest
From George's foibles?
--- ROSE ---
Well, you'll have to learn to live with it.
That and all his other pet obsessions:
God and Trollope,
Other women...
--- GIULIETTA ---
Please, Rose!
--- Unknown ---
George is a remarkable man.
He was there when I thought I had no one.
He saw me through my darkest moments.
He made me talk about my husband.
--- Unknown ---
We had been married five days...
He drove like the wind...
Not any more...
--- Unknown ---
But George was always there,
No matter when or where.
He stopped me feeling so alone...
--- ROSE ---
When did you meet him?
--- GIULIETTA ---
One evening at Harry's bar --
He wore a silver tie pin
And a smile that was even brighter...
--- ROSE ---
I know that tie pin --
It catches on everything!
--- GIULIETTA ---
And as for all those paint rags...
--- ROSE ---
Heaven help us!
--- BOTH ---
We deserve a medal!
--- ROSE ---
Nice to see that George has settled in:
Fifteen novels on the go, as always!
Used to drive me to distraction...
--- GIULIETTA ---
Please, Rose!
--- Unknown ---
Last year he forgot my birthday,
So I rearranged his bookmarks...
--- ROSE ---
George dear, we're talking --
We don't need you hovering.
--- GIULIETTA ---
My darling, you're completely right --
--- Unknown ---
We're doing fine without you.
--- Unknown ---
GEORGE (smiles)
I get the picture.
Condemn me to solitude!
--- ROSE ---
You'll find some things to keep you occupied.
--- GIULIETTA ---
We'll call you if we need you!
--- ROSE & GIULIETTA ---
Time and light are fading --
Shouldn't we make the most
Of every precious moment?
Life is sweet and slow and still
And perfect!
All the more, now our man George
Has brought the two of us together!
--- ROSE ---
I never imagined she'd be like that --
Your lady friend comes as a sweet surprise...
A wonderfully sweet surprise...
--- GEORGE ---
Take a deep breath and prepare yourself...
I've been such a trusting fool...
Those wretched investments I made
Have gone down the drain...
After today, there'll be no more champagne...
The ways of the world are cruel...
--- ROSE ---
If I ask a question,
Will you promise...?
You must promise...
That the answer to my question is yes...
--- GEORGE ---
Yes, I'll say yes...
--- ROSE ---
Take a deep breath and prepare yourself...
My mind is in such a mess...
But really, George,
All that I wanted to ask was this:
Would you be willing to marry me?
--- GEORGE ---
I've already told you.
