------ Seeing is Believing ------
--- ALEX ---
Seeing is believing,
And in my arms I see her:
She's here,
Really here,
Really mine now --
She seems at home here...
--- Unknown ---
Seeing is believing,
I dreamt that it would be her:
At last
Life is full,
Life is find now...
--- Unknown ---
Whatever happens,
One thing is certain:
Each time I see
A train go by,
I'll think of us,
The night, the sky
Forever...
--- ROSE ---
He's young,
Very young,
But appealing --
I feel I know him...
--- Unknown ---
Seeing is believing
And I like what I see here.
I like
Where I am,
What I'm feeling...
--- Unknown ---
What are we doing?
Can you believe it?
A starving actress and
A star-struck boy --
Oh well, I might
As well enjoy
This moment...
--- ALEX ---
Can you believe it?
--- BOTH ---
Seeing is believing!
I never thought I'd be here
Is this
Really me?
Am I dreaming?
--- Unknown ---
No way of knowing
Where this is leading...
It's fun forgetting
Who we are...
Who cares?
When now the world is far
Behind us...
--- Unknown ---
Seeing is believing!
My life is just beginning!
We touched,
And my head
Won't stop spinning,
From winning
