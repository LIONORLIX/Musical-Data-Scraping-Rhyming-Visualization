------ The Garden at Pau ------
--- JENNY ---
Say the word!
Say it now!
Nice and loud!
--- Unknown ---
ALEX (defeated)
What the hell, then --
Uncle!
--- Unknown ---
Jenny you're a monster!
You ought to be locked up!
--- Unknown ---
JENNY (going into the house)
Before I am,
I think I'll dress for dinner --
You mix the drinks...
--- Unknown ---
ALEX (looking after JENNY)
She needs a Paris education.
I've told you time and time again.
--- ROSE ---
And wouldn't that be cozy?
You could then have your very own Parisienne!
--- Unknown ---
Alex, how can you even think
Of moving her away from this place?
I mean, Alex, you of all people have found
That leaving here is hard to face.
--- ALEX ---
Yes, I love it here and always will...
But Rose, it's not the views
Or the vines that keep me here...
I stay year after year
For something far deeper...
Being in this house
Makes the past seem very near...
--- BOTH ---
...When the world was a playground
All train-rides and laughter,
And love in the morning...
--- ROSE ---
...And armagnac after...
--- ALEX ---
Since leaving the army
And being around you,
I know I'm reliving
The night that I found you...
--- ROSE ---
But George...
I couldn't hurt George...
Oh Alex, you know by now
How much I love him...
--- ALEX ---
So what is it
You feel for Hugo?
--- ROSE ---
Please understand I'm not in love with him.
He's a friend, he makes me laugh...
That's all it is.
Alex, can't you see
That you mean much more to me?
--- Unknown ---
Alex, that's why I won't
Play the lover with you.
What I did to you once
Wasn't easy to do --
But I only have one life,
