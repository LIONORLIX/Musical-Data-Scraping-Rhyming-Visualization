------ An Art Exhibition in Paris ------
--- GEORGE ---
Damn the boy!
Damn the boy's
Damn-fool schoolboy antics!
--- GIULIETTA ---
Calm down now, George...
--- Unknown ---
GEORGE (interrupting, reads)
Nephew Alex break in, stop.
Stealing household supplies, stop.
Living in sin, stop.
Please advise, stop.
My gardener, J?r?me!

GIULIETTA (smiles)
How very nice!
How sweet!
--- GEORGE ---
How handy!
My bed!
My brandy!
--- GIULIETTA ---
He sounds like you --
I think you ought to introduce us!
--- GEORGE ---
Giulietta.
You'd better cancel supper at Chez Max --
This week was fun.
It shouldn't end like this...
--- GIULIETTA ---
This interlude was heaven...
--- GEORGE ---
How sad to think that it must end
When it had just begun...
--- GIULIETTA ---
George, you've got a painter's eye:
Everything is magnified!
I know you're all he's got,
But I don't see why you should go.
--- GEORGE ---
No, I must go.
Our little fling has done us good.
I have my paint.
You have your clay:
We both have work...
--- GIULIETTA ---
I know, I know.
Don't look so sad, George!
What times we've had, George!
--- GEORGE ---
There'll be more...
--- GIULIETTA ---
Ah yes.
That's true.
