------ Jenny's Bedroom in Paris ------
--- ALEX ---
Come on, Jenny.
That's enough now.
Jenny, even mermaids
Have to sleep.
--- JENNY ---
I am a mermaid
With golden hair...
--- ALEX ---
Come on, Jenny.
Be a good girl.
--- Unknown ---
JENNY (suddenly serious)
Alex, let me hold you...
There's so much I want to say...
--- Unknown ---
I want you here forever,
In my arms and in my life,
To belong to you entirely...
You know we're not just cousins...
--- Unknown ---
ALEX (getting up)
We are just cousins, Jenny,
And you're fifteen years old.
--- Unknown ---
JENNY (pulling him back)
It's not as if I don't know passion
From living in our house...
I've learnt that feelings can run deep...
--- ALEX ---
We'll talk tomorrow --
Go to sleep.
--- Unknown ---
Taking more...
Than I ought to take...
--- Unknown ---
What are you doing?
Don't even think it...
You have no right to feel this way,
And yet...
I love her, and I must not love her...
I wish to God we'd never met...
She ought to be
The last one I should think of...
--- GEORGE ---
I know he's
Up there with her now...
--- ALEX ---
She ought to be
The last one I should love...
--- GEORGE ---
If he is,
My God, I'll kill him...
--- ALEX ---
She ought to be
The last one I should care for...
--- GEORGE ---
I should have
Stopped this long ago...
--- ALEX ---
The very last...
--- GEORGE ---
Selfish little cradle-snatcher...
Twisted, rotten, heartless monster...
Filthy, filthy callous bastard...
--- Unknown ---
I was right...
He's in there...
There he is...
He's in there...
--- Unknown ---
Jenny, my Jenny,
I can't let him take you,
I...
--- ALEX ---
George...George...
--- ALEX ---
I was saying goodnight to Jenny,
When I heard a noise in the passage...
--- Unknown ---
He must have fallen
And had a heart attack.
--- Unknown ---
HUGO (to ROSE who is bending down to attempt to revive GEORGE)
No, it's hopeless...
--- ROSE ---
He was listening --
Jenny mustn't know.
If she asks you,
Say he died while sitting by the fire --
