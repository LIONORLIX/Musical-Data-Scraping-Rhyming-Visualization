Legend has it that it was written by the dark ones.
Necranomicon Exmortis, roughly translated, Book of the Dead.
The book served as a passage way to the evil worlds beyond.
It was written long ago when the seas ran red with blood.
It was this blood that was used to ink the book.
In the year 1300 A.D. the book disappeared.
