------ I'm Not A Killer ------
--- ASH ---
Now it's time to die, you old hag!
--- LINDA ---
You found me beautiful once.
--- ASH ---
Honey, you got real ugly.
--- Unknown ---
I'm not a killer,
I'm an S-Mart employee.
And to kill a coworker
Is against company policy.
--- Unknown ---
But you tried to kill me,
So now I must say goodbye.
I'm sorry Linda,
But now you must die!
--- Unknown ---
Die, die
Die, die
Die, die
Die, die
Die, die
Die, die
Oh die
Oh die
--- ANNIE ---
Daddy, I'm home!
--- ASH ---
Uh, this isn't as bad as it looks!
