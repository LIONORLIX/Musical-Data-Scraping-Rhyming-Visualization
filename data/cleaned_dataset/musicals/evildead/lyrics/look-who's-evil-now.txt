------ Look Who's Evil Now ------
--- CHERYL ---
Why have you disturbed our sleep?
Awakened us from our ancient slumber?
You will die! Nightmare is before you
Like others before you, you're gonna tumble
--- Unknown ---
One by one
We're gonna take you
One by one
Nothing you can do
One by one
You'll surely fall
One by one
We're gonna kill you all
--- Unknown ---
Now I'll ask you a question, not where or why or how
But who?
Look who's evil now
--- Unknown ---
Whooaaaaaaaaaa!!! Sock it to me, baby!
--- Unknown ---
Look who's evil
Look who's evil
Look who's evil now
--- Unknown ---
I said, look who's evil
Look who's evil
Look who's evil now
--- Unknown ---
I heard you suckers mocking me and calling me a prude
Let's see if you're still laughing when I rip out your Fallopian tubes
WRONG: I'll twist your funbags I'll beat your brown eyes blue
RIGHT: I'll twist your funbags I'll beat your brown eye blue
Then I'll smash your sack and make a testicle fondue
--- Unknown ---
Just try and fuck with me
I'll show you where your grave is
If being evil's cool
Consider me Miles Davis
Now I'll ask you a question, not where or why or how
But who?
Look who's evil now
--- Unknown ---
Now I told you all earlier I would take you all out one by one,
and I'm not one to make false promises, so kids, let's kick it!
--- Unknown ---
First Ash
WRONG: I'll whoop your ass
RIGHT: I'll whip your ass
And Scott
WRONG: I'll bust your nuts
RIGHT: I'll bust your nut
Shelly
I'll slash your belly
And Linda
WRONG: I'll put a pencil in ya!
RIGHT: I'll stick a pencil in ya!
--- LINDA ---
My ankle! I can't walk.
--- ASH ---
Take her to the bedroom and make sure she's okay.
--- CHERYL ---
You can't stop me
You can't stop me
You can't stop me now
--- Unknown ---
I said, you can't stop me
You can't stop me
You can't stop me now
--- Unknown ---
Who's the stupid bitch now, Scotty? Who's the stupid bitch now?
--- SHELLY ---
Look who's evil now!
--- SCOTT ---
Not Shelly too!
--- SHELLY ---
Oh my God, like, look at me and my evil demon bod
Now watch me shove this high heel straight up your love rod
I'll tear your body into shreds and beat you with his balls
WRONG: And then I'll swallow up your sould without gagging at all
RIGHT: And then I'll swallow up your soul without gagging at all
I'm sexy, I'm cute
And so evil to boot
I'd kill you with these guns, but I don't think they shoot
Now I'll ask you a question
--- CHERYL ---
Sing it!
--- SHELLY ---
Not where or why or how
But who?
Look who's evil now
--- SCOTT ---
Dude, grab the fucking gun! Shoot her! Shoot it!
--- ASH ---
I can't shoot Shelly. She's a friend of ours.
--- SCOTT ---
Goddamnit, Ash, I picked up that skank drunk in a bar three days ago...
--- Ash shoots Shelly. ---
