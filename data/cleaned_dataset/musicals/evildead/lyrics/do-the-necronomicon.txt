------ Do the Necronomicon ------
--- CHERYL ---
Now we honor the Necronomicon
--- FEMALE CANDARIAN DEMONS ---
Now we honor the Necronomicon
--- ALL CANDARIAN DEMONS ---
Now we honor the Necronomicon
Now we honor the Necronomicon
--- LEAD ---
Now we honor the Necronomicon
With our very own special dance
--- ASH ---
How the hell do demons do their very own special dance?
--- LEAD ---
In hell we dance our own special way
Let`s show him how we dance while our bodies decay
--- SHELLY ---
Do we bounce like Backstreet?
--- LEAD ---
Not without a heartbeat
--- JAKE ---
Do we grind like Michale Bivens?
--- LEAD ---
Bel Biv Devoe before the living.
--- LINDA ---
Do we whoop like Tag Team?
--- LEAD ---
Not without a bloodstream
--- ED ---
Let`s Macarena like that group did!
--- LEAD ---
No that`s just stupid
--- ALL CANDARIAN DEMONS ---
Deadite zombies like to get their freak on
And when we get together they do the Necronomicon
Do the Necronomicon
Do the Necronomicon
Come on, come on
And do the Necronomicon
--- LEAD ---
You gotta follow the moves
--- Unknown ---
(Jake and Ed grunt)
--- Unknown ---
Right to the letter
--- Unknown ---
(Shelly squeals)
--- Unknown ---
It`s just like the time warp
--- OTHER CANDARIAN DEMONS ---
What?!?!?!?!
--- LEAD ---
Only better!
--- OTHER CANDARIAN DEMONS ---
--- ALL CANDARIAN DEMONS ---
First we jump
Then we sit down
Then we get back up
And lasso all around
Then we spin
Clap our hands
Then take a big moment to acknowledge the band
Do the robot
And the sprinkler
And finish it off with our best Henry Winkler
?Ay!?
--- Unknown ---
Deadite zombies like to get their freak on
And when we get together they do the Necronomicon
Do the Necronomicon
Do the Necronomicon
Come on, come on
And do the Necronomicon
--- SHELLY ---
Can we kill these suckers yet?
--- LEAD ---
Just wait a little bit
--- JAKE ---
Can we beat them with a shoe?
--- LEAD ---
Not ?til we?re done the tune
--- CHERYL ---
Can we mutilate these fools?
--- LEAD ---
No! Follow the rules
--- ED ---
I say we attack!
--- LEAD ---
What are you on? Crack?
After our dance we?ll attack our old friends
But before we do that, let`s Necronomicon again
--- OTHER CANDARIAN DEMONS ---
--- ALL CANDARIAN DEMONS ---
First we jump
Then we sit down
Then we get back up
And lasso all around
Then we spin
Clap our hands
Then take a big moment to acknowledge the band
Do the robot
And the sprinkler
And finish it off with our best Henry Winkler
?Ay!?
