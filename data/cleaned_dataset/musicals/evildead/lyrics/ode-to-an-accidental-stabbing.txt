------ Ode to an Accidental Stabbing ------
--- JAKE ---
Goddamn you woman! You fucking stabbed me!
Goddamn you woman! Do I look like a fucking zombie?
--- Annie ---
It was a mistake! What can I do to prove I am sorry?
--- Jake ---
Well, in the future I'd appreciate it if you could not fucking stab me!
Goddamn you woman.
--- Annie ---
I didn't mean to hurt you.
--- Jake ---
You really got me pissed!
--- Annie ---
Or make you bleed.
--- Jake ---
Goddamn you woman.
--- Annie ---
I'll make you feel better.
--- Jake ---
This hurts like a son of a bitch!
--- Annie ---
Would you like some Pepcid AC?
--- Jake ---
Woman look what you've done! I'm bleeding all over the fucking room!
--- Annie ---
Then take this cloth and apply pressure to your wound.
--- Jake ---
Bitch, get me somewhere safe! That thing's still out there in them trees.
--- Annie ---
No one can hurt you here!
--- Cheryl ---
No one but me! Come on, fatty!
--- Jake ---
Goddamn you woman!
