We're all jammed in the car
And we're going really far
Driving deep into the trees
With hod dogs, chips and cheese
--- Unknown ---
To make the week go quicker
We've packed a ton of liquor
Rye and Tropicana
We'll go totally BANANAS!

Spring break vacation is just
bling bling
'Cause something in this musky air
makes us want to sing

Cabin in the woods (oooh)

All my friends are here
For the best spring break of the year
Away from school and from S-Mart
A week way off the charts
--- LINDA ---
A holiday with Ash
All that I'd ever ask
He's so cute and thin
And that's why
I love him

This will be just like camp
But with a slutty tramp
In a few hours you will see me
Doing the nasty in a tree

Scott's looking to get busy
But fresh air makes me dizzy
I'm so his perfect girl
Oh, look, there goes a squirrel!
--- CHERYL ---
A week up in the woods of
pure tranquility
A chance for me to rest in a
nice facility
I came up to this cabin to read
and sleep and bake
--- SCOTT ---
Hope our headboard rattlin' don't
keep your prude ass awake!

Seven days to snuggle my honey bun
--- SHELLY ---
A week of drinking
--- SCOTT ---
And premarital sex
--- CHERYL ---
And tonight I'll make some snacks out of Hershey bars and Chex
--- ALL ---
Listen to us now and make no mistake
We're gonna have fun 'cause it's

We'll pour, we'll score, we'll fall
