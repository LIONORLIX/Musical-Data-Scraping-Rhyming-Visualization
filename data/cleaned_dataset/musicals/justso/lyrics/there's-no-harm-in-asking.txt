------ There's No Harm In Asking ------
--- Unknown ---
There's no harm in asking
Why everything should be just so
There's no harm in dreaming
That someday I'll know all there is to know
I just want to know
Perhaps it's true that some surprises
Are much better left untold
But there's no harm in hoping
That one day their secrets
Unfold

Why does the ostrich have feathers that grow in a plume?
And why does the hippo have tiny red eyes
When there's so much room for eyes to bloom?
Why do camels get the hump?
Why does the crab play with the sea?
--- Unknown ---
Why does no one seem to be bothered by questions but me?
--- Unknown ---
In these High and Far-Off Times
There must be reasons behind rhymes
There must be answers to every question
And puzzle, I propose
Though I've asked all of my cousins
Aunts and uncles in their dozens
The only thing I've learned
Is no one knows
No one knows...

There's no harm in asking
Why everything should be just so
There's no harm in dreaming
That someday I'll know all there is know
--- Unknown ---
Perhaps it's true that some surprises
Are far better left untold
But there's no harm in hoping
That one day their secrets
Unfold
--- Unknown ---
There's no harm in asking
Why everything should be
Just so
