------ The Limpopo River ------
--- Unknown ---
You must go to the banks
Of the great grey-green
To the banks of the green
And greasy Limpopo River
Set about with fever trees
All aquiver
So you must go to the banks
Of the Limpopo River
--- Unknown ---
On the banks of the river
Your search will end
There, where the Limpopo waters
Meet the might of the ocean
Dangers lurk
Beware your foolhardy notion
Journeys that end there may tend to
Bring much mixed emotion
--- Unknown ---
It's great
As the River Nile
It's grey
But a certain style
It's green
Why not stay a while?
It's greasy!
--- Unknown ---
It sounds rather vile
But if that's where I must go
Then plans should be made
Maybe I could bring an end to the crab's tirade
I'm not afraid
--- Unknown ---
So you must go to the banks
Of the great grey-green
To the banks of the green
And greasy Limpopo River
Set about with fever trees
All aquiver
--- Unknown ---
(So I must go) So you must go to the banks of the Limpopo River
--- Unknown ---
You'll find your answer in the River Limpopo
--- Unknown ---
You must go to the banks
Of the great
Grey grey-green
To the banks of
The great great greasy
Limpopo River
Set about with fever trees all aquiver
--- Unknown ---
You must go to the banks
Of the great
Grey grey-green
To the banks of
The great great greasy
