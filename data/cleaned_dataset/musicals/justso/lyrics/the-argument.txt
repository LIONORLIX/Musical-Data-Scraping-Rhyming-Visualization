There's no harm in asking you say it yourself all the time
So why when i ask you a question myself is it such a crime`
No wonder i'm a bit confused by this whole trip though
I was willing to have a stab
But have you even thought what you'll do when you next meet the crab`

Silly questions silly questions
Why should i tell you  my plan`
Let's get something straight
You're here to navigate
Prove to me you can
--- Unknown ---
Kolokolo
Might i just remind you that it wasn't me who came to find you
Next time pick a bird you know can fly
--- Unknown ---
Ec
So tell me why can't you fly`
Are you too plump`
Why don't you just climb a tree trunk and jump
It seems such a waste
If i had wings
I know that i'd make good use of the things
--- Unknown ---
Kolokolo
Perhaps i was wrong to have bothered to come after all

Ec
If i had wings i know i'd fly

Kolokolo
Thinking you're big doesn't give you the right to make me feel small
--- Unknown ---
Ec
I'm sure you could why don't you try
--- Unknown ---
Kolokolo
And even if you find the crab then i'm willing to make a bet
That he won't think a small bag of bones poses mush of a threat!

Silly questions silly questions

Kolokolo
Silly questions no replies

Don't you turn this round on me
You must find him first then i'll do my worst just you wait and see
--- Unknown ---
Both
This will get us nowhere if i knew the river i would go there!
I would do far better on my own!
--- Unknown ---
Ec
So tell me why can't you fly` are you a freak`
You've got two fine wings but you just use your beak.
If i could fly, over the trees, i'd find the river
Limpopo with ease!

Why am i scared` how could i fall`
Birds take the air in their stride after all
Birds take the air in their stride after all
