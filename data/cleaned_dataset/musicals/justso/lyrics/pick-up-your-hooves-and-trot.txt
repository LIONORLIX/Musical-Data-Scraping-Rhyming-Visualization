------ Pick Up Your Hooves And Trot ------
--- Unknown ---
Zebra
Me mother used to say, don`t let fella`s have their way,
Cos they`ll only treat you like a piece of meat.
Now this jumbo and his bird, with a plan that sounds absurd,
Come along and try to whisk me off my feet.
Giraffe
Imagine somewhere distant and romantic,
And where the pace of life is not so frantic.
Pick up your hooves and trot girl, off to another spot girl,
Somewhere we`ve never been. Out where the sun will never set on us.
Elephants child
Out where the pastures green`
Zebra
Wouldn`t it be amazing, if we could both be grazing,
Far from the common herd
Giraffe and elephants child
So pick up your hooves and trot girl, not another word.
Pick up your hooves and trot girl off to another spot girl
Giraffe
What do we have to lose` Maybe we`ll find the perfect guys for us.
Zebra and kolokolo
Maybe we`ll find bad news
Giraffe and zebra
Nobody gains who dithers, time that we shook our withers,
No point in sitting here, pick up your hooves and trot girl
All
It`s the best idea.

Giraffe and zebra
Pick up your hooves and trot girl off to another spot girl.
Just choose the path to tread.
Who knows what good the change may do for us` Who knows what lies
Ahead`
Elephants child and kolokolo
Who knows what lies ahead`
All
Enough of this silly banter,
Time for a gentle canter, let`s make the move today.
Giraffe
Pick up your hooves and trot girl
Both
Pick up your hooves and trot girl
All
Somewhere far away
Giraffe
So long to chasing round the veldt
Zebra
So long to places we once dwelt
Giraffe
Goodbye to being someone`s feast
Zebra
Goodbye to boring wildebeest
Giraffe
So long
Zebra
Goodbye
All
Farwell, so long
Giraffe and zebra adieu
