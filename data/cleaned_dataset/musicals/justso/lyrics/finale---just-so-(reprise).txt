Just so we all know who's
Just so we all know who's
Just so we all know who's who
Just so we have a different job to do
Just so we can diversify

Making us easy to identify
Just so we know who we are meant to be
Just so i can tell him from me

Just so zoologists have fun
Trying to list us one by one or two by two will do
The only thing they really need to know
We've done all of  our growing head to toe
We've done all of our growing head to toe
We've done all of our growing head to toe
We've done all of our growing head to toe
