------ We Want To Take The Ladies Out ------
--- Unknown ---
Leopard
We want to take the ladies out for dinner
Jaguar
We want to take the ladies out to eat
Leopard
We dream of taking ladies out
Jaguar
And in a moment you will see the spleandour of the truly tender gender
Leopard
We anticipate each rendez-vous with relish.
We?d love to find a way into their hearts.
Jaguar
If we honoured and obeyed them
Leopard
They might let us marinade them
Both
And then savour all their constituent parts
Jaguar
Help us find them otherwise i fear,if we get cross,
You will be our main course and we?ll use this bird as dental floss.
Both
We want to take the ladies out, to slaughter.
We want to take the ladies out, for good!
Leopard
If you have not yet tried their meat, you ouchta
Jaguar
Cos nobody can quibble, we?re all partial to a nibble
Leopard
How we hunger for the ladies inner beauty
Jaguar
Those heart strings that have never yet been strung
Both
Just tell us where to find them, so that we can bump and grind them.
As a new sensation leaves them feeling numb,
We?ll penetrate to depths as yet unplumbed.
Jaguar
They like billing and cooing
Leopard
We like killing and chewing
Both
We want to take the ladies out, we want to take the ladies out,
