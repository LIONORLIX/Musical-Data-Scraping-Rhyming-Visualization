Jungle light
Noone can escape it's touch, reaching down between the leaves,
Who can trust those magic fingers, light distorts and light decieves.

Beams of colour in the dark, streaming to the jungle floor,
Who is hiding in the shadows, who can be entirely sure
--- Unknown ---
Company girls
Sifting the images shifting, who can be entirely sure

Jungle light illusions playing with the light

All
Reaching down between the leaves, light distorts
And light decieves, where the rays of sun light land,
There your bodies will be tanned
Jungle light

Giraffe
It's brash
Zebra
It's bold
Both
It's daring. But it's what we'll be wearing from this day on

Wildebeest
It's brash, it's bold, it's daring
Giraffe and zebra
But it's what we'll be wearing...
All
From this day on
Just so we all know who's who
Just so we have a different job to do
Just so we can diversify
Filling the land and sea and sky
Making us easy to identify
Just so we know who we are meant to be
Just so i can tell him from me
If there's a niche that we can fill
In a fantastic way we will
Until at last we know
We've done all of our growing head to toe
We've done all of our growing head to toe
Becoming just...
