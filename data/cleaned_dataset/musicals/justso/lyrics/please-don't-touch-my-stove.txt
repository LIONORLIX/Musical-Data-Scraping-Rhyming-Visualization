Parsee
Please don't touch my stove
It's all i have
My only treasure trove
So precious i will gladly face your charge no matter
What my crime as long as you don't try to come between my and my primus
--- Unknown ---
Rhino
But what about my skin? It's all i have to keep myself within
But look at it all wrinkled up and more contorted than a worm is
However could you do this to a rhino's epidermis
--- Unknown ---
Stove
Why do we torment eachother so?
Respect is all we need to show
To make a friend out of the foe
There we live united by the loam
The fringe of beaches that we comb
It's quaint but what the heck it's home
--- Unknown ---
Parsee
I extend a hand
A token to bring peace back to our land
I never thought that i would see the day
When we would call a truce so i don't go on living like
That lonely mr crusoe
--- Unknown ---
Rhino
I extend a trotter
To compensate for being such a rotter
From now on maybe you will bake me cakes
Ill relish every bite and who knows
If i eat enough my skin once more may tighten
--- Unknown ---
All
Now at last hostilities can stop
It's time for barriers to drop
--- Unknown ---
Rhino and parsee
We both have recipies to swap
--- Unknown ---
All
How we'll/you'll go together with aplomb
Someone to walk with on the prom
And borrow cups of sugar from
--- Unknown ---
Rhino and parsee
We now get the chance
--- Unknown ---
Ec and stove
You ought to grab it
--- Unknown ---
Rhino and parsee
To harmonise, we're buddies at first glance
--- Unknown ---
Ec and stove
Why not cohabit?
--- Unknown ---
Parsee
I'm resolute that from this moment on, i'll chnage the way i govern
--- Unknown ---
Rhino
It was all my fault for being such a sloven
--- Unknown ---
All
Friendship has arisen from a fruit bun
In the oven
--- Unknown ---
Rhino, parsee and stove
Isn't this the perfect way to leave us as our story ends
Friends!
