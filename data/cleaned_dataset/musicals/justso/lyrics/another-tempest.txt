------ Another Tempest ------
--- ADULT ELEPHANTS ---
Ha! Hey!
Ha! Hey!
Another Tempest
The water rises
Our skills at swimming would not win prizes
Our homes are flooded, The land?s a mire
So we aspire to move to higher ground
The sea is foaming
The waves are tidal
For us to stay here
Is suicidal
The crops are rotting
Our food is Scanty
It?s no sea shanty
So we are anti-crabs

Pau Amma, Pau Amma
He rules the Ocean Floor
And has us all firmly underneath his claw

Ha-a
Hey-ey
Ha-a
Hey-ey
Ha-a-ey
Hey-
(Fading) Mm
Mm
