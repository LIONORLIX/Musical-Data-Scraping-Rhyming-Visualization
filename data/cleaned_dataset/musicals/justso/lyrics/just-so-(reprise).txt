------ Just So (Reprise) ------
--- Unknown ---
Eldest magician
Just so you all know who's who
Just so you have a different job to do
Just so you can diversify
Filling the land and sea and sky
Making you easy to identify
Just so you know who you are meant to be
Just so i can tell him from me
If there's a niche that you can fill in a fantastic way you will
Until at last you know
You've done all of your growing head to toe
Becoming just...
