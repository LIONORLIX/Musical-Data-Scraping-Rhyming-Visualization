------ Give the Girls a Break! ------
--- Unknown ---
Life on the playground
It?s such a battlefield,
everytime the boys play
Hey boys, give the girls a break
--- Unknown ---
We start a friendly game of freeze tag
And before you know it, they?re tackling lads
So hey boys, give the girls a break
--- Unknown ---
My mother tells me that it?s just a phase, yeah right
And some day they are going to change, hard to believe
I?m always willing to start anew
But it?s so hard when every day they?re chasing you
--- Unknown ---
So I am careful and stay on guard
You never know when they will charge
So hey boys, give the girls a break
Hey boys, give the girls a break!
