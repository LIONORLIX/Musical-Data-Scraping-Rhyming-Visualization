------ She'd Appreciate It ------
--- Unknown ---
They?re gone again
Here I am
All alone once again, with nothing to do
In my solitude
My mother can?t play now
Gotta find a way to cope somehow
The hour is long, times are gettin? rough
What else can I do, but get into my sister?s stuff?
--- Unknown ---
Barbie needs a haircut what do you say?
I really think my sister would like her that way
She?d appreciate it
Let?s go investigate it
--- Unknown ---
I really think that doll house could use some paint
My sister will come home and call me a saint
For all the work I did
She?d appreciate it!
--- Unknown ---
I could spend my time doin? things for myself
But there?s such pleasure
doin? things for somebody else, so?
--- Unknown ---
My sister?s bike has a flat
I?m very certain I can fix that
Where?s the super glue?
I?ll make it good as new!
These are things she will appreciate!
--- Spoken ---
Hannah: Oh I think I hear my sister coming in right now! Hi sis!
Jen: Oh what have you done!?!
