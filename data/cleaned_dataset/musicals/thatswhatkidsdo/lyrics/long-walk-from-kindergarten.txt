------ Long Walk from Kindergarten ------
--- Unknown ---
It?s a long walk from kindergarten
It?s a long walk to first grade
It?s a long walk from kindergarten
I hear the big kids say, those were the days!
--- Unknown ---
Where?s the cookies?
Forget about it
Story time?
Ya gotta live without it
What?s this homework thing every night?
Those are the facts, ya better tow the line
--- Unknown ---
Chorus
--- Unknown ---
Where?s the big books?
They?re history
Circle time
Sorry kid
Centers and hubs
Get over it
Get with the program, and you?ll do fine
--- Unknown ---
I recall fondly those half days
There was time for everything
A little work
A little play
Such a good balance
Those were the days!
