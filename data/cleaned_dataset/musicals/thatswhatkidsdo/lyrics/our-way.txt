------ Our Way ------
--- Unknown ---
They want to play
We say ok
The least little fuss
They want to blame us
So hear what I say
This is our plea
So can you see our way?
--- Unknown ---
A game of football
We like to play hard
One little fall
Call the National Guard
So hear what I say
This is our plea
So can you see our way?
--- Unknown ---
And since we?re talking
I am sorry ?bout the window
I hoped you?d forget
My ball missed the net
Oops?
We did it our way
Our way?
