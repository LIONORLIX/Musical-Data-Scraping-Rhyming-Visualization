------ Cafeteria Food ------

Doc. I think it started in September
When I went back to school
I?ve been feeling kind of weak in the knees
And my face looks a little blue
I?ve heard stories of incredible bravery
Where kids survived all 12 grades
Tell me how they do it
Tell me before it?s too late

Cafeteria Food
Fine school cuisine
Cafeteria food
Guaranteed to keep you lean
Oh save me from cafeteria food?

Today I think I had Salisbury steak
At least I hope it was that
?Cause I?ve been told by upper grades who know
The fried chicken is really fried rat
You can dismiss this as just kid rumor
But these are my people, why shouldn?t I believe?
They say it?s documented that it?s just policy
