------ Cool ------
--- Unknown ---
It?s not something that I plan
Or try to do
It?s just the way that I am,
guess I?m one of the chosen few
In the morning when I wake,
my coolness seems to take
And by the time I get to school,
there?s no doubt about my clout
I am cool
--- Unknown ---
When I walk I have a glide
I?ve heard kids say
Lots of kids try to move like I move.
And imitate
I don?t really think about it
Or consciously pursue
There?s no way around it,
you hear the talk in the halls
I was born cool
--- Unknown ---
Isn?t he cool, cool, cool
Isn?t he hot, hot, hot
Can you believe all the coolness
He has got
Just the other day, I heard him sing
And he sounded like the blond guy, in ?N Sync
--- Unknown ---
As humble as I try to be
It can be pretty tough
when I have all these eyes watching me
There?s no going out, with my family
The moment we walk in, heads begin to spin
We?re collectively cool

Chorus

Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool , cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool ,cool ,cool cool!
