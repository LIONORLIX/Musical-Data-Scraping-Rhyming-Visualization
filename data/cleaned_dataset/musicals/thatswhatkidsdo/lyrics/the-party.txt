------ The Party ------
--- Unknown ---
The party, the party,
Everyone?s talkin? ?bout the party
This one, that one, the party?s all I hear?
How could she forget me?
Doesn?t she remember that I sat next to her last year?
The party, the party everyone?s talkin? ?bout the party
The walls are talkin? ?bout the party
Everyone is going, but me!
