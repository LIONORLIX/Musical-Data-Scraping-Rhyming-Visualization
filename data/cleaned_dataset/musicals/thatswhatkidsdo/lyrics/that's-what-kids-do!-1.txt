------ That's What Kids Do! 1 ------
--- Unknown ---
Think I?ll take off my shoes
and I?ll run outside in the rain
Come on and I?ll race you
?Cause that?s what kids do
--- Unknown ---
We?re on a search for
the biggest puddle we can find
Come on and jump in
?Cause that?s what kids do
--- Unknown ---
Care for a mud pie my friend
Oh yes please, and with plenty of leaves
and sticks mixed in!
--- Unknown ---
If you see me by days end,
and I?m all covered with dirt
Don?t let me alarm you
?Cause that?s what kids do
--- Unknown ---
Got my room half cleaned up,
Mom, isn?t that enough?
I Need to dance and play
Oh what a great day!
--- Unknown ---
I know my homework isn?t done
Can?t I finish later on?
I need to have some fun
?Cause that?s what kids do
