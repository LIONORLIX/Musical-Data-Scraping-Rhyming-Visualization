------ The Night Before ------
--- Unknown ---
What if she calls me Margret?
I can?t find my green shirt!
I feel sick!
I am not a morning person!
--- Unknown ---
You think you?ve got problems?
--- Unknown ---
I can?t believe she?s gonna make me go through this
She knows I don?t learn anything, before noon or one
--- Unknown ---
I am simply not programmed for activities at nine!
--- Unknown ---
The night before, so much is up in the air
Chaos everywhere
Hopes on a wing and a prayer for tomorrow
The night before, so much is at stake
Another month of summer [would] be great
Instead I?ll learn my fate, tomorrow
--- Unknown ---
Why can?t I be home schooled?
Just think of how much help I?d be around the house?
--- Unknown ---
I just have this feeling I?m gonna walk in,
the day will begin hello Margret
And I?ll be too afraid to say I?m Maggie
--- Unknown ---
And It's Margret, Margret, Margret,
how are you tonight?!
I?ll be Margret, Margret, Margret
the rest of my life!
--- Unknown ---
Where is my red shirt?
--- Unknown ---
The night before
Emotions are running righ
A wild combination inside
Scared but also excited, ?bout tomorrow
The night before
