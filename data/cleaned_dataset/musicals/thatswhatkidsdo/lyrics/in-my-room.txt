------ In My Room ------
--- Unknown ---
In my room, no one can judge me
In my room, I have endless possibilities
In my room
--- Unknown ---
In my room I can dance to a full house
The crowd just roars, and begs more, more?
But I wave goodbye, and fly away
I can fly in my room
--- Unknown ---
In my room, no one can bug me
In my room, I am anything I want to be
In my room
--- Unknown ---
In my room I can dance to a full house
The crowd just roars, and begs more, more?
But I wave goodbye, and fly away
I can fly in my room
--- Unknown ---
In my room, no one can bug me
In my room, I am anything I want to be
In my room
--- Unknown ---
In my room
--- Unknown ---
