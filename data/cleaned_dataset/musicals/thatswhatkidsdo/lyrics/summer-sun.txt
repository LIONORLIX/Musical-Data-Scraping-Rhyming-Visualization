------ Summer Sun ------
--- Unknown ---
Some people like the winter that?s cool
They like the snowy tree tops glistening, and the Yule
But I prefer to feel a summer sun beating down
My feet burning up a path on the summer ground
--- Unknown ---
Give me the Summer Sun (4x)
--- Unknown ---
We?ll go for a stroll along the boardwalk
We?ll be sipping our sodas over a talk
In the summer sun?
We?ll kick up the sand along the beach
As the waves come within our reach
In the summer sun?
--- Unknown ---
All of the flower?s show their colors in June
And even the birds seem to sing a Beach Boy?s tune
I?ll stay up all night, under a radiant moon
And in the morning, I?ll sleep as late as I want to
--- Unknown ---
Give me the summer sun (4x)
--- Unknown ---
We?ll go to the movies and carnival
We don?t have to worry anymore
In the summer sun
It?s just a picnic every day
Come and meet me by the bay
In the summer sun?
--- Unknown ---
I?ll be laughing by the pool
Drifting on a raft all afternoon
In the summer sun
Then we?ll have some barbecue
It?s the summer thing to do
In the summer sun?
