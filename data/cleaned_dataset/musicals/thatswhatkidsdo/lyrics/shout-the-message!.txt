------ Shout the Message! ------
--- Unknown ---
There was a time when leaves were greener
The ocean was bluer for you and me
That was the world then, miles of meadows
And the rivers they did flow, pure and clean
--- Unknown ---
Sometimes realizations come too late
And you lose something precious if you wait
The things we thought meant success somehow
All just appear so unimportant now
--- Unknown ---
Shout the message to the world
If we take then we must give
To the earth in which we live
--- Unknown ---
There was a time when,
simple desires could be acquired
with lesser needs
Hang on, we?re getting closer
to understanding what we really need
--- Unknown ---
After we attained the biggest prize
Nothing would be as great as the bluest sky
The fancy dancing life that money brings
Doesn?t seem to count that much
in the scheme of things
--- Unknown ---
Shout the message to the world
No substitute can do,
what love can do for you
--- Unknown ---
If enchanting voices sing
They are bluebirds calling
Flying high above the country skyline
As they sail into the wind,
I?ll remember listening
And that song will last for a lifetime?
--- Unknown ---
Shout the message to the world
If we take then we must give
to the earth in which we live
--- Unknown ---
Shout the message to the world
no substitute can do,
what love can do for you
