------ Christmas (Baby Please Come Home) ------
--- Unknown ---
(Christmas)
The snow's coming down
I'm watching it fall
Lots of people around
Baby please come home
--- Unknown ---
(Christmas)
The church bells in town
All ringing in song
Full of happy sounds
Baby please come home
--- Unknown ---
They're singing "Deck The Halls"
But it's not like Christmas at all
Cuz I remember when you were here
And all the fun we had last year
--- Unknown ---
(Christmas)
Pretty lights on the tree
I'm watching them shine
You should be here with me
Baby please come home
--- Unknown ---
There singing deck the halls
But it's not like Christmas at all
Cuz I remember when you were here
And all the fun we had last year
--- Unknown ---
(Christmas)
If there was a way
I'd hold back this tear
But it's Christmas day
Please
Please
Please
Please
Baby please come home
Baby please come home
Baby please come home
