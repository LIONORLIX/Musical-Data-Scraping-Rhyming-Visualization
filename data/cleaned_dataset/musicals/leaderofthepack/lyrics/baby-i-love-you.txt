(Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh)

Have I ever told you how good it feels to hold you
It isn't easy to explain
And though I really keep trying, I think I may start crying
My heart can't wait another day
When you kiss me I've just got to say
--- Unknown ---
(Baby I love you) C'mon baby
(Baby I love you) Ooh-ee baby
(Baby I love you) Baby I love only you
--- Unknown ---
I can't live without you, I love everything about you
I can't help it if I feel this way
Oh I'm so glad I found you, I want my arms around you
I love to hear you call my name
Oh tell me that you feel the same

(Baby I love you) C'mon baby
(Baby I love you) Ooh-ee baby
(Baby I love you) Baby I love only you

C.mon baby (Baby I love you)
Sweet baby (Baby I love you)
--- FADE ---
C.mon baby (Baby I love you)
Ooh-ee baby (Baby I love you)
Oh, oh oh
