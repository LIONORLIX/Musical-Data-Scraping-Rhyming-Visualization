No, I'm not doin' very well.
I built a lot of dreams, but they fell down two by two.
Yes it's true.
--- Unknown ---
I never thought he'd say good-bye.
But when the music changed I felt the magic die.
Oh why... oh why?
--- Unknown ---
We were standin' at the top.
But the panic wouldn't stop.
And the chapel of love fell down.
With the English beat all around.
--- Unknown ---
I don't wanna turn the pages. Rock of Rages.
--- Unknown ---
Oh, Mama- I'm callin',
but no one listens to me anymore.
Oh, Daddy- I'm fallin'.
And please catch me like you always did... before.
--- Unknown ---
Oh, now I'm barely hangin' on.
You know, the fear rushed in when the innocence was gone.
It was gone... can't go on.
--- Unknown ---
I tried to sleep away the pain.
But I can't keep the tears from fallin' like the rain.
It's insane. All this pain.
--- Unknown ---
You know, I was hiding.
My worlds colliding.
And the leader of the pack went down.
Is she ever comin' back to town.
--- Unknown ---
I don't wanna turn the pages.
Rock of Rages.
--- Unknown ---
Mama I miss you- Wanna be with you.
Mama you always knew how to help me.
And Daddy I miss you- Wanna be with you.
Wish you could come back just for a little while.
--- Unknown ---
Oh, Mama- I'm breakin'.
Please take me and hold me in your arms tonight.
Oh, Daddy- I'm shakin'.
Please wake me...
