------ Maybe I Know ------
--- Unknown ---
Maybe I know that he's been a cheatin'
Maybe I know that he's been untrue
But what can I do
--- Unknown ---
I hear them whispering when I walk by
He's gonna break her heart and make her cry
I know it's me they're talking about
I bet they all think I'll never find out
--- Unknown ---
Ohhh but Maybe I know that he's been a cheatin'
Maybe I know that he's been untrue but what can I do
--- Unknown ---
My friends are telling me that he's no good
He isn't treating me the way he should
He really loves me that's all I can say
Before my tears fall I just walk away
--- Unknown ---
Ohh but Maybe I know that he's been a cheatin'
Maybe I know that he's been untrue
But what can I do
Ohhhh
--- Unknown ---
Deep down inside he loves me
Though he may run around
Deep down inside he loves me
Some day he'll settle down
--- Unknown ---
Ohhh Maybe I know that he's been a cheatin'
Maybe I know that he's been untrue
But what can I do
--- Unknown ---
He really loves me that's all I can say
Before my tears fall I just walk away
--- Unknown ---
Ohh but Maybe I know that he's been a cheatin'
Maybe I know that he's been untrue
But what can I do
--- Unknown ---
Ohh but Maybe I know that he's been a cheatin'
Maybe I know that he's been untrue
