------ Keep It Confidential ------
--- Unknown ---
If a man can love a liar
And a woman can love a thief
There’s a few things baby
You should know about me
--- Unknown ---
I’ve always looked for power
In all the lovers I knew
But now I know the glory
Of simply loving you
--- Unknown ---
You see, I don’t play your charades
Ooh it’s time to stop the masquerade
Why don’t you strip me bare, feel the truth
That’s all I’ve got to give to you
--- Unknown ---
Why take these secrets,
Oh but keep them confidential
Keep ‘em strictly confidential
--- Unknown ---
[Loving you baby is on my mind
Keep 'em.]…cont.
--- Unknown ---
I would call you lover
But you used that name before
Livin’ under coverr always keeping score
But there’s a few things ’bout ya baby
That’s breaking this chain of lies
No one else could make me
Open up my eyes
--- Unknown ---
You see, I won’t play your charades
Oh it’s time to stop the masquerade
Why don’t you strip me bare,
Feel the truth
That’s all I’ve got to give to you
--- Unknown ---
Why don’t you take these secrets,
Oh but keep them confidential
Keep ‘em strictly confidential
Strictly confidential
Keep ‘em confidential
Strictly confidential
Keep ‘em strictly confidential
--- Unknown ---
Keep ‘em…..cont.
--- Unknown ---
Loving you baby is on my mind
