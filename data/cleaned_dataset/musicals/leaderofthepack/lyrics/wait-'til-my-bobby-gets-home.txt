------ Wait 'til My Bobby Gets Home ------
--- Unknown ---
You've been calling in me every day Ever since my Bobby went away You've been knocking on my fromt door And I know just what you're looking for, but Even though you really look so fine And we've been having good times CHORUS: I'm gonna wait, 'till my Bobby gets home Wait 'till my baby gets home Yeah, yeah, yeah you better leave me alone True I need some lovin' and some kissin' and a huggin' But I'll wait 'till my Bobby gets home You wanna take me to a movie show I gotta tell you that I just can't go I know Bobby's gonna call tonight I wanna tell him evey thing's allright, and Though I haven't got a thing to do And I'm so lonely and blue CHORUS (Sax solo) CHORUS (Fade on Wait 'till my Bobby gets home, whoa-whoa-whoa...)
