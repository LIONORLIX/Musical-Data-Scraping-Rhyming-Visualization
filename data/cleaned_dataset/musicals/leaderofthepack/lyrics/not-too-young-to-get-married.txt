------ Not Too Young To Get Married ------
--- Unknown ---
My momma said I can't see you no more,
'Cause we don't know what love really means.
She says we can't get married
For three years or more (awww),
'Cause we're only in our teens.
--- Unknown ---
Oh, no, we're not too young, young to get married.
Not too young, young to get married.
What kind of difference can three years make?
I've gotta have you now or my heart will break.
Not too young, young to get married.
Not too young, young to get married.
I couldn't love you more than I do today.
--- Unknown ---
I remember when I brought you home,
I remember what my momma said.
When I told her that I loved you so,
She told me I was outta my head.
--- Unknown ---
Oh, no, we're not too young, young to get married.
Not too young, young to get married.
What kind of difference can three years make?
I've gotta have you now or my heart will break.
Not too young, young to get married.
Not too young, young to get married.
I couldn't love you more than I do today.

(Woot!)
--- Unknown ---
But, till the day I die,
I wanna spend my every day with you.
Don't they know how they make me cry,
When they carry on like they do?
--- Unknown ---
Oh, no, we're not too young, young to get married.
Not too young, young to get married.

Not too young, young to get married.
Not too young, young to get married.
Not too young, young to get married.
Not too young, young to get married.
Not too young, young to get married.
Not too young, young to get married.
Not too young, young to get married.
Fade.
Not too young, young to get married.
Not too young, young to get married.
Not too young, young to get married.
