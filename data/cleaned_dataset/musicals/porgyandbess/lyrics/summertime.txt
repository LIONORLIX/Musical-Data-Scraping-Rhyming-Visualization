------ Summertime ------
--- Unknown ---
Summertime,
And the livin' is easy
Fish are jumpin'
And the cotton is high
--- Unknown ---
Your daddy's rich
And your mamma's good lookin'
So hush little baby
Don't you cry
--- Unknown ---
One of these mornings
You're going to rise up singing
Then you'll spread your wings
And you'll take to the sky
--- Unknown ---
But till that morning
There's a'nothing can harm you
