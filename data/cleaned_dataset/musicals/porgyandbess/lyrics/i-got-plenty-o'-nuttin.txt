------ I Got Plenty o' Nuttin ------
--- Unknown ---
Oh, I got plenty o' nuttin'
And nuttin's plenty for me
I got no car, got no mule
I got no misery
--- Unknown ---
De folks wid plenty o' plenty
Got a lock on de door
'Fraid somebody's a-goin' to rob 'em
While dey's out a-makin' more
What for
--- Unknown ---
I got no lock on de door
Dat's no way to be
Dey kin steal de rug from de floor
Dat's okeh wid me
'Cause de things dat I prize
Like de stars in de skies
All are free
--- Unknown ---
(Refrain:)
Oh, I got plenty o' nuttin'
And nuttin's plenty for me
I got my gal, got my song
Got Hebben the whole day long
No use complaining
Got my gal, got my Lawd
Got my song
--- Unknown ---
Oh, I got plenty o' nuttin'
And nuttin's plenty for me
I got the sun, got the moon
Got the deep blue sea
--- Unknown ---
De folks wid plenty o' plenty
Got to pray all de day
Seems wid plenty you sure got to worry
How to keep the debbel away
Away
--- Unknown ---
I ain't frettin 'bout hell
'Till de time arrive
Never worry long as I'm well
Never one to strive
To be good, to be bad
What the hell
I is glad I's alive
