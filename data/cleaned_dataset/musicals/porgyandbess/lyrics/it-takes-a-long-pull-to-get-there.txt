------ It Takes a Long Pull to Get There ------
--- Unknown ---
Oh, I`m agoing out to the Blackfish banks
No matter what the wedder say,
And when I say I`m going I means going
And I`m leaving at the break of day.
It takes a long pull to get there, huh!
It takes a long pull to get there, huh!
It takes a long pull to get,
But I`ll anchor in the Promises land,
In the Promises land.
And lawdy1, if I meet Mister Hurricane2
And Harricane tell me no
I`ll take old Harricane by the pants
And I`ll throw him in the jailhouse dock.
It takes a long pull to get there, huh!
It takes a long pull to get there, huh!
It takes a long pull to get there,
But I`ll anchor in the Promises land,
In the Promises land.
I got a blister on my setting down place3,
I got a blister in my hand
But I`m going row this little boat, trust me Gawd4,
Till I anchor in the Promises land.
It takes a long pull to get there, huh!
It takes a long pull to get there, huh!
It takes a long pull to get there,
But I`ll anchor in the Promises land,
