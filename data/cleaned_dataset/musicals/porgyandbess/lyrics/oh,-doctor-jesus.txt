Oh, doctor Jesus,
Who done trouble the water in the Sea of Galilee.
--- Porgy ---
Amen!
--- Serena ---
And likewise who done cast the devils out
of the afflicted time and time again.
--- Porgy ---
Time and time again.
--- Peter ---
Oh, my Jesus!
--- Serena ---
Oh, doctor Jesus,
What make you ain`t lay your hand on this poor sister head?
--- Lily ---
Oh, my father!
--- Serena ---
And chase the devil out of her down a steep place
Into the sea like you used to do time and time again.
--- Porgy ---
Time and time again. Oh, my Jesus!
--- Serena ---
Life this poor cripple up out of the dusk.
--- Porgy ---
Hallelujah!
--- Serena ---
And life up his woman and make her well time and time again,
And save us all for Jesus sake. Amen.
--- Porgy and Peter ---
