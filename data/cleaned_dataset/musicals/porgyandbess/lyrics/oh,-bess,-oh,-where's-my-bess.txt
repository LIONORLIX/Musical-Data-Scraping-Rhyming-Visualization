------ Oh, Bess, Oh, Where's My Bess ------
--- PORGY ---
I ain' axin' yo' opinion.
Oh, Bess, oh where's my Bess,
Won't somebody tell me where?
I ain' care what she say,
I ain' care what she done,
Won't somebody tell me where's my Bess?
Bess, Oh, Lawd,
--- Unknown ---
My Bess! I want her now,
Widout her I can't go on.
I counted de days dat I was gone
Till I got home to see her face.
Won't somebody tell me where's my Bess?
I want her so, my gal, my Bess, where is she?
Oh Gawd, in yo' big Heav'n please show me where I mus' go,
Oh give me de strength, show me de way!
Tell me de truth, where is
she, where is my gal, where is my Bess!
