------ My Own Morning ------
--- Unknown ---
I want a door that belongs to me
I want a bed that belongs to me
I wanna know when I climb into bed I'll wake up in my own morning - a morning that really belongs to me.
I want a floor that belongs to me.
I want a chair that belongs to me.
I wanna know when I rock in that chair,
I'll look up at my own ceiling.
And oh, what a feeling that's gonna be.
The golden hours waiting in a line.
I can pick like flowers hanging on a vine.
And on that day that belongs to me,
I'll have a man that belongs to me,
to share the door and the floor,
and the bed and the chair,
and my own morning.
Where every hour is golden.
No one to whom I'm beholden.
The morning that really belongs to me.
And oh, what a feeling that's gonna be.
The golden hours waiting in a line.
I can pick like flowers hanging on a vine.
And on that day that belongs to me,
I'll have a man that belongs to me,
to share the door and the floor,
and the bed and the chair,
and my own morning.
Where every hour is golden.
No one to whom I'm beholden.
The morning that really belongs to me.
Belongs to me
