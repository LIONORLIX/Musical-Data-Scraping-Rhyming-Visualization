While other lovers sing your praises
in phases deftly lyrical.
I'm a cat who's better at a scat song
that's satirical
In begging for your hand, sweet chick
I hope you'll understand this lick.
My love to you I bring on account a you can sing
Bli-Blip Varthy Flam flam flam Hipideedleada Baaaaaaaaaaimp
My love for you in true on account a you can do
Bli-Blip Varthy Flam flam flam Hipideedleada Baaaaaaaaaaimp
My poor heart gives a start like a Jitter Bug just won't stop
Mix your crooning with my spooning and let me blow my top.
Your love to me I've sworn on account a mine is your'n
