------ All of Me ------
--- Unknown ---
All of me
Why not take all of me
Can't you see
I'm no good without you
--- Unknown ---
Take my lips
I want to loose them
Take my arms
I'll never use them
--- Unknown ---
Your goodbye
Left me with eyes that cry
How can I go on dear without you
--- Unknown ---
You took the part
That once was my heart
So why not take all of me
--- Unknown ---
All of me
Why not take all of me
Can't you see
I'm no good without you
--- Unknown ---
Take my lips
I want to loose them
Take my arms
I'll never use them
--- Unknown ---
Your goodbye
Left me with eyes that cry
How can I go on dear without you
--- Unknown ---
You took the best
So why not take the rest
