------ Bounce Me, Brother (with a Solid Four) ------
--- Unknown ---
Say, what kind of beat is that
Man, that really spins my hat
Doesn't sound like boogie woogie,
But it's really got a beat.
--- Unknown ---
Sounds to us like it's in four
Let us hear it just once more
C'mon and latch on to that rhythm
'Cause a solid four's my beat
--- Unknown ---
Some folks like to hear eight beat rhythm,
I don't go for that stuff no more,
Anytime you really want to send me,
Bounce me brother with a solid four.
--- Unknown ---
Come on in, the whole place is jumpin',
Everybody's out on the floor,
If you want to keep the rhythm pumpin',
Bounce me brother with a solid four.

The boogie woogie was never like this,
We've got a new beat that no one can miss
If boogie woogie sent you like I think it did,
[ From: http://www.elyrics.net]
Four to the bar will flip your lid.

Move the tables and roll the rug up,
Shut the windows and lock the door,
While I try to dig the Li'l Brown Jug up,
Bounce me brother with a solid four.
--- Unknown ---
Clang, clang, clang, clang, clang, clang,
The joint is jumpin' as it never did before
Clang, clang, clang, they're saying
Bounce me brother with a solid four.
