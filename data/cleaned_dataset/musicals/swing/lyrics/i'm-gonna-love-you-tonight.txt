So i'm just another pin-up girl
Here to ?
We share a dance but i know the score,
Soldier, you're already spoken for
Him:
Oh honey don't tell me no, the music's playing nice 'n slow
I'll go through the ?ringer, round around your finger
Come on and love me tonight!
Her:
It seems i'm not cool to fight to become your blushing bride, you wanna dance with many ? And go home and marry maple, why should i love you tonight?

Tonight i wanna give myself a much better look

Let's just swing side by side
And let my conscience be your guide

Both:
