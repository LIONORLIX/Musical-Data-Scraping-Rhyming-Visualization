------ Take Me Back To Tulsa ------
--- Unknown ---
Where's that gal with red dress on some folks called her Dinah
Stole my heart away from me way down in Louisiana
Take me back to Tulsa I'm too young to marry
Take me back to Tulsa I'm too young to marry
Little bee sucks the blossom big bee gets the honey
Poor man raise the cotton rich man makes the money
Take me back to Tulsa...
Walk and talk to Suzy walk and talk to Suzy
Walk and talk to Suzy walk and talk to Suzy
Take me back to Tulsa...
We always wear a great big smile we never do look sour
Travel all over the country playing by the hour
Take me back to Tulsa...
Take me back to Tulsa...I'm too young to wed thee

Alt verse;
Went down to the railroad, laid my head upon the track
Thought about that gal of mine and I gradually eased her back
