I got a gal in Kalamazoo
Don't want to boast but I know she's the toast of Kalamazoo
--- Unknown ---
Years have gone by, my my how she grew
I liked her looks when I carried her books in Kalamazoo
--- Unknown ---
I'm gonna send away, hoppin' on a plane, leavin' today
Am I dreamin'? I can hear her screamin'
Hiya, Mr. Jackson
Everything's OK, A-L-A-M-A-Z-O
--- Unknown ---
Oh, what a gal, a real pipperoo
I'll make my bid for that freckle-faced kid I'm hurryin' to
I'm goin' to Michigan to see the sweetest gal in Kalamazoo
