------ Jersey Bounce ------
--- Unknown ---
(scat intro)
They call it that Jersey bounce
A rhythm that really counts
The temperature always mounts
Wherever they play, the funny rhythm they play
--- Unknown ---
It started on Journal Square
And somebody heard it there
He put it right on the air
And now you hear it everywhere
--- Unknown ---
Uptown, gave it new licks
Downtown, added some tricks
No town, makes it sound, the same
As where it came from
--- Unknown ---
So if you don't feel so hot
Go out to some Jersey spot
And whether you're hep or not
The Jersey bounce'll make you swing
--- Unknown ---
(scat)

Oh come on and play that Jersey bounce

They call it that Jersey bounce
A rhythm that really counts
The temperature always mounts

It started on Journal Square
And somebody heard it there

That tune called the Jersey Bounce
--- Unknown ---
Uptown, gave it new licks
Downtown, added some tricks
No town, make it sound the same
As where it came from
--- Unknown ---
So if you don't feel so hot
Go out to some Jersey spot
And whether you're hep or not
The Jersey bounce'll make you swing
--- Unknown ---
Ounce by ounce
The Jersey Bounce
Puts you right in the swing
That Jersey Bounce
It'll make you swing
