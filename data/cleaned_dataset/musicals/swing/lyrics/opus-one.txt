------ Opus One ------
--- Unknown ---
Oh! baby, I'm rackin' my brain, to think of a name
To give to this tune, so Perry can croon
And maybe old Bing will give it a fling
And that'll start everyone hummin' the thing
--- Unknown ---
The melody's dumb, repeat and repeat
But if you can swing, it's got a good beat
And that's the main thing, to make it complete
'Cause everyone's swingin' today
--- Unknown ---
So we call it Opus One, it's not for Sammy Kaye, hey,
Hey, hey
Opus One, it's got to swing, not sway, baby
--- Unknown ---
If Mr. Les Brown can make it renowned
And Ray Anthony could rock it for me
There's never a doubt, you'll knock yourself out
