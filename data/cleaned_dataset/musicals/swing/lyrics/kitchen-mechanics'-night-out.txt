------ Kitchen Mechanics' Night Out ------
--- Unknown ---
In a very exclusive kitchen,
At an address on Park Avenue
As she scoured and stacked the dishes,
a certain maid was feeling blue.
--- Unknown ---
Every night as he cooked the dinner,
for a family that was not his own,
A ballroom up in Harlem,
Was where their minds would roam.
--- Unknown ---
But one night a week at 7,
they could throw off their drab couture,
cuz on Thursdays at they Savoy,
They could be who they really were.
--- Unknown ---
Put down that frying pan,
and take me by the hand.
Girl we gonna get a night to jump and shout
Kitchen Mechanic's night out!
--- Unknown ---
It's going to be alright,
we get to swing tonight,
we'll be cheek to cheek and baby don't you pout
Kitchen Mechanic's night out!
--- Unknown ---
A Thursday Cinderella,
gardenia in her hair,
add one prince charming fella,
her Harlem Fred Astaire.
--- Unknown ---
Just grab yourself a bow,
cuz you don't need no dough,
ladies night to lindy and it's all about
Kitchen Mechanic's night out!
--- Unknown ---
(instrumentals)
--- Unknown ---
It's time that they all knew,
the floor belongs to you,
ladies night to lindy and it's all about
Kitchen Mechanic's night out!
--- Unknown ---
Kitchen Mechanic's Night....
