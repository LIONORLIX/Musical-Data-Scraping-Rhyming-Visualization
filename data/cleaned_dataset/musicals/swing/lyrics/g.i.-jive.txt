------ G.I. Jive ------
--- Unknown ---
This is the G. I. Jive
Man alive
It starts with the bugler blowin' reveille over your bed when you arrive
Jack, that's the G. I. Jive
--- Unknown ---
Roodley-toot
Jump in your suit
Make a salute
Boot
--- Unknown ---
After you wash and dress
More or less
You go get your breakfast in a beautiful little caf? they call The Mess
Jack, when you convalesce
--- Unknown ---
Outta your seat
Into the street
Make with the feet
Reet
--- Unknown ---
If you're a P-V-T, your duty
Is to salute to L-I-E-U-T
But if you brush the L-I-E-U-T
The M-P makes you K-P on the Q-T
--- Unknown ---
This is the G. I. Jive
Man alive
They give you a private tank that features a little device called fluid drive
Jack, after you revive
--- Unknown ---
Chuck all your junk
Back in the trunk
Fall on your bunk
Clunk
--- Unknown ---
This is the G. I. Jive
Man alive
They give you a private tank that features a little device called fluid drive
Jack, if you still survive
--- Unknown ---
Chuck all your junk
Back in the trunk
Fall on your bunk
Clunk
--- Unknown ---
Soon you're countin' jeeps
But before you count to five
Seems you're right back diggin' that G. I. Jive
