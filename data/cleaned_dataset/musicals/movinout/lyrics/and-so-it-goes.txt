------ And So It Goes ------
--- Unknown ---
In every heart there is a room
A sanctuary safe and strong
To heal the wounds from lovers past
Until a new one comes along
--- Unknown ---
I spoke to you in cautious tones
You answered me with no pretense
And still I feel I said too much
My silence is my self defense
--- Unknown ---
And every time I've held a rose
It seems I only felt the thorns
And so it goes, and so it goes
And so will you soon I suppose
--- Unknown ---
But if my silence made you leave
Then that would be my worst mistake
So I will share this room with you
And you can have this heart to break
--- Unknown ---
And this is why my eyes are closed
It's just as well for all I've seen
And so it goes, and so it goes
And you're the only one who knows
--- Unknown ---
So I would choose to be with you
That's if the choice were mine to make
But you can make decisions too
And you can have this heart to break
--- Unknown ---
And so it goes, and so it goes
