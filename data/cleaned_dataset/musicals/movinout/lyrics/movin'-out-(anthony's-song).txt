------ Movin' Out (Anthony's Song) ------
--- Unknown ---
Anthony works in the grocery store
Savin' his pennies for someday
Mama Leone left a note on the door,
She said,
Sonny, move out to the country.
Workin' too hard can give me
A heart attack
You oughta know by now
Who needs a house out in Hackensack?
Is that what you get with your money?
--- Unknown ---
It seems such a waste of time
If that's what it's all about
If that's movin' up then I'm movin' out.
--- Unknown ---
Sergeant O'Leary is walkin' the beat
At night he becomes a bartender
He works at Mister Cacciatore's down
On Sullivan Street
Across from the medical center
He's tradin' in his Checy for a Cadillac
You oughta know by now
And if he can't drive
With a broken back
At least he can polish the fenders
--- Unknown ---
It seems such a waste of time
If that's what it's all about
If that's movin' up then I'm movin' out.
--- Unknown ---
You should never argue with a crazy mind
You oughta know by now
You can pay Uncle Sam with overtime
Is that all you get for your money?
--- Unknown ---
It seems such a waste of time
If that's what it's all about
