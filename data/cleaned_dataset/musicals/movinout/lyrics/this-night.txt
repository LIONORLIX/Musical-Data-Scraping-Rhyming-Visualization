------ This Night ------
--- Unknown ---
Didn't I say
I wasn't ready for a romance
Didn't we promise
We would only be friends
--- Unknown ---
And so we danced
Though it was only a slow dance
I started breaking my promises
Right there and then
--- Unknown ---
Didn't I swear
There would be no complications
Didn't you want
Someone who's seen it all before
--- Unknown ---
Now that you're here
It's not the same situation
Suddenly I don't remember the rules anymore
--- Unknown ---
This night is mine
It's only you and I
Tomorrow
Is a long time away
This night can last forever
--- Unknown ---
I've been around
Someone like me should know better
Falling in love
Would be the worst thing I could do
--- Unknown ---
Didn't I say
I needed time to forget her
Aren't you running from someone
Who's not over you
--- Unknown ---
How many nights
Have I been lonely without you
I tell myself
How much I really don't care
--- Unknown ---
How many nights
Have I been thinking about you
Wanting to hold you
But knowing you would not be there
--- Unknown ---
This night
You're mine
It's only you and I
I'll tell you
To forget yesterday
This night we are together
--- Unknown ---
This night
Is mine
It's only you and I
Tomorrow
Is such a long time away
This night can last forever
--- Unknown ---
Tomorrow
Is such a long time away
