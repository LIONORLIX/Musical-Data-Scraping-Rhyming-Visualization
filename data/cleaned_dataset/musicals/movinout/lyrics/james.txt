James
We were always friends from our childhood days.
And we made our plans,
And we had to go our sep'rate ways.
I went on the road,
You pursued an education.
--- Unknown ---
James
Do you like your life?
Can you find release?
And will you ever change?
Will you ever write your masterpiece?
--- Unknown ---
Are you still in school
Living up to expectations?
James
You were so relied upon,
Ev'rybody knows how hard you tried.
--- Unknown ---
Hey
Oh, look at what a job you've done,
Carrying the weight of fam'ly pride.
--- Unknown ---
James
You've been well behaved, you've been working hard
But will you always stay
Someone else's dream of who you are?
Do what's good for you
Or you're not good for anybody.
James
--- Unknown ---
I went on the road,
You pursued an education.
James
How you gonna know for sure?
Ev'rything was so well organized.
--- Unknown ---
Hey
Oh, now ev'rything is so secure,
and ev'rybody else is satisfied.
James
Do you like your life?
Can you find release?
And will you ever change?
When will you write your masterpiece?
Do what's good for you
Or you're not good for anybody.
James
