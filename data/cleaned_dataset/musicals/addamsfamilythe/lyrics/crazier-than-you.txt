------ Crazier Than You ------
--- Unknown ---
once, I was hopeful
thought we were one.
Life, less than perfect
finally begun.
But, now i wonder
are we undone?
i wanna treasure you in death as well as life
I wanna cut you with my love and with my knife
but can i live as your tormentor and your wife
when i am crazier than you
i'm crazier than you
and nothing up til now has proved me wrong
i'm crazier than you
that's just the overview
so get on board or simply move along
--- Unknown ---
I'm not impulsive
I'm not deranged
but in this moment
I feel I've changed.
I wanna climb Mt. Everest go to Mozambique
i wanna be impulsive want to be unique
can you believe i mean it when you hear me shriek
I'm crazier than you
I'm crazier than you
and now i'll prove to you exactly how
i'm crazier than you
I'll do what you can do
from here on in i give my solemn vow
--- Unknown ---
pluck the arrow from its quiver,
hold it in your hand be brave.
Pierce the apple not the liver
or we're dancing on my grave.
Place it in the bow and steady,
Can't you shoot that thing already!
I wanna demonstrate that fear is my ideal
Cause in the moment that you're frightened life is real
and in a flash when i release and seal the deal
--- Unknown ---
I'm crazier than you
I'm crazier than you
and nothing hurts me when i hear you say
I'm crazier than you
psychotically into
and that is all i need to face the day
i'm crazier than you
i'm crazier than you
and live or die i'll let you have control
I'm crazier than you
so say you love me too
from here on in you're singing to my soul
