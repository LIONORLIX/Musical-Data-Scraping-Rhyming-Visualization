------ Pulled ------
--- WEDNESDAY ---
I don't have a sunny disposition.
I'm not known for being too amused.
My demeanor's locked in one position.
See my face? I'm enthused.
Suddenly, however, I've been puzzled.
Bunny rabbits make me want to cry.
All my inhibitions have been muzzled,
And I think I know why.
--- Unknown ---
I;m being pulled in a new direction,
But I think I like it.
I think I like it.
I'm being pulled in a new direction.
Through my painful pursuit,
Somehow birdies took root.
All the things I detested impossibly cute.
God! What do I do?

Mother always said be kind to strangers,
But she doesn't know what they destroy.
I can feel the clear and present dangers,
When she learns that the boy...
--- Unknown ---
Has got me pulled in a new direction,
But I think I like it.
--- PUGSLEY ---
That was good! That was good!
--- WEDNESDAY ---
I think I like it.
--- PUGSLEY ---
Do it again! Do it again!
--- WEDNESDAY ---
I'm being pulled in a new direction,
But this feeling, I know is impossible,
So I'll confide that I've tried but I can't let it go.
It's disgustingly true!
Pulled, pulled, pulled!

Puppy dogs with droopy faces,
Unicorns with dancing mice,
Sunrise in wide open spaces,
DisneyWorld - I'll go there twice!
Butterflies and picnic lunches,
Bunches of chrysanthamums,
Lollipops and pillow fights and christmas eve,
Sugar plums!
String quartets and Chia Pets,
And afternoon banana splits,
Angels watching as I sleep,
And Liberace's Greatest Hits!
--- Unknown ---
Have got me pulled in a new direction!
If they keep insisting, I'll stop resisting.
Just watch me pulled in a new direction.
I should stay in the dark,
Not obey every spark,
But the boy has a bite,
Better far than his bark!
And you bet I'll bite too,
Do what's truly taboo,
