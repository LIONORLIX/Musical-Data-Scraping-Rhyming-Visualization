------ Waiting ------
--- Alice ---
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
--- Unknown ---
A woman waits for marriage
A woman waits for children
She waits for her big Mal to come back home
At five o'clock
Or six o'clock
'Til it's nine o'clock
And there's no o'clock to ease the pain
Pain she can't explain
--- Unknown ---
As the woman waits in the dark
For a spark that once was there
That isn't there, not ever there!
Alone and
Waiting and wailing
Whining and waning
Wanting and wasting and woe
--- Unknown ---
Waiting, fixating
Debating, lose weighting
Ice skating, lacating- and so
--- Unknown ---
We wait to laugh
We wait to cry
We wait for every hopeful breath
Waiting for a lousy, rotting,
Vicious, rancid, fetid,
------ fin ------
