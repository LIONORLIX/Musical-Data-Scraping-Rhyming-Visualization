------ In The Arms ------
--- MAL ---
(spoken)Something happened Alice. Something weird and wonderful.
(sung)I hear a music I have Never heard before
I feel the waves though I am nowhere near the shore
in the arms of a squid
I touched my secret longing
all embraced as I faced
a world both warm and new
in the charms of a squid
I lost my inhibitions
and found my love for you
--- Unknown ---
And in the arms
of a squid
all tentacled and squishy
rearranged
I was changed
by something sort of fishy
for at once
as I hugged
a thousand cups of suction
I found my love for you
--- Unknown ---
Who'd of guessed that I'd discover God
cuddling with a two-ton cephalopod!
--- ALICE ---
In the arms of a squid
--- MAL ---
I was saved and born anew
--- ALICE ---
She saw your soul
--- MAL ---
She saw my soul
--- ALICE ---
She took control
--- MAL ---
She took control
and finally I can stomach sushi
but,my dear
--- ALICE ---
Oh Mal-
--- MAL ---
Now it's clear
--- ALICE ---
Big Mal
--- MAL/ALICE ---
My love for you is endless
--- MAL ---
In the arms
--- ALICE ---
In the arms
--- MAL ---
Of a squid
--- ALICE ---
Of a squid
--- MAL ---
I was dared
--- ALICE ---
You were dared
--- MAL ---
And I did!
--- ALICE ---
God,you did!
--- BOTH ---
