Ah, the intoxicating spell of the graveyard.  Once a year when the last leaf of autumn falls, we gather to honor the great
cycle life and death.  Come,every member of our clan - living, dead- and undecided and let us celebrate what is to be an
Addams.
--- Gomez(Sung) ---
When you're an Addams
You need to have a little moonlight
When you're an Addams
You need to feel a little chill
You have to see the world in shades of gray
You have to put some poison in your day
--- Motricia(Spoken) ---
The's the way
--- Gomez and Morticia ---
When you're an Addams
--- Gomez ---
You need to have a sense of humor
--- Gomez and Morticia ---
When you're an Addams
--- Morticia ---
You need to have a taste for death
--- Gomez/Morticia ---
Who cares about the world outside
And what it wants from you
When you're and Addams
You do what Addams always do!
--- Addams Family ---
When you're an Addams
--- Gomez ---
You gotta have a lotta passion
--- Addams Family ---
When you're an Addams
--- Morticia ---
You need to really love your wife
--- Gomez (Spoken) ---
Several times a day
--- Addams Family ---
You're happy when your toes are in the mud
--- Fester and Grandma ---
You smile a bit the moment you smell blood
AA-OOOH!!!
--- Addams Family ---
When you're an Addams
--- Wednesday ---
You need to grab a bow and arrow
--- Addams Family ---
When you're an Addams
--- Pugsley ---
You need a moment to explode
--- Grandma ---
Just pour a potion
--- Fester ---
Flip the switch
--- Fester/Grandma/Wednesday/Pugsley ---
And wait till things get hot
--- Addams Family ---
When you're an Addams
You have to really stir the pot
--- Fester ---
So keep your sunshine
And keep your glee
--- Gomez ---
Country music and Tennessee
--- Wednesday ---
Keep you laughter
--- Grandma ---
And MTV
--- Addams Family ---
And all will be all right
Give us shadows and give us gloom
Broken glass in a motel room
Something fun we can all exhume
And give it all tonight!
--- Gomez(Spoken) ---
And on this special night,beneath our Family Tree,we summon our beloved Ancestors.
--- Ancestors ---
One torn asunder
Down six feet under
We get to gather here
--- Male Ancestor One ---
Dead for forever
--- Male Ancestor Two ---
Bled from whatever
--- Male Ancestors One and Two ---
Called now to reappear
--- Male Ancestor Three/Female Ancestor One ---
Every cadaver
Start the palaver
Once in an Addams year
--- Ancestors ---
Hold your decaying
Hear what we're saying
Time now to give a cheer
--- Gomez (Spoken) ---
Line Dance!
Bunny Hop!
Do the Twist!
Rigor Mortis!
--- All ---
When you're an Addams
--- Male Ancestors ---
That's right!
When you're an Addams
--- Addams Family/Female Ancestors ---
You have a very special duty
--- Male Ancestors ---
Late night!  Out with the Addams!
--- Addams Family/Female Ancestors ---
When you're an Addams
--- Male Ancestors ---
With one bite
--- All ---
You're obligated to the clan
It's family first and family last
And family by and by
When you're an Addams
The standard answers don't apply
When you're and Addams
You do what Addams do or-
--- Lurch ---
Ughhh
