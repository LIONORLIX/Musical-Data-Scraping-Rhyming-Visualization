------ Full Disclosure ------
--- Gomez ---
This is the sacred chalice
From Addams families past
Firm in my digitals
Held fast
De-cast!
Here, in this sweet libation
Salavation resides
Feel the sweet sensation
Revelation provides
Full disclosure!
It's a game that we play
Let your darkest secrets
Give you away
Face your demons
And then happily say
I'm playing
Full disclosure
With all these crazy happy people
--- Gomez/Morticia/Fester/Grandma/Pugsley/Ancestors ---
Full disclosure!
--- Gomez ---

Once a favorite

He loved his full disclosure

Fall from grace or fall in love with the moon

Sung:
Now, with a dash potion
My sister blows her cool
Hopefully in slow-motion
She'll drop,
She'll drool
One sip of acrimonium
And then she will change
Boy, oh boy, her full disclosure's
Gonna be strange!
