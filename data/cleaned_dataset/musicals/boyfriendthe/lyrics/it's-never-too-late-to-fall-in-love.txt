I may be too old to run a mile
Run a mile?
Yes, run a mile
But there's one thing I still do very well
--- Unknown ---
I may be too old to climb a stile
Climb a stile?
But there's one thing at which I still excel
--- Unknown ---
Although my hair is turning grey
Yes, it's rather grey!
I still believe it when I say
Well, what do you say?
--- Unknown ---
I'ts never too late to have a fling
For Autumn is just as nice as Spring
And it's never too late to fall in love
Boop-a-Doop, Boop-a-Doop, Boop-a-Doop
It's never too late to wink an eye
I'll do it until the day I die
And it's never too late to fall in love
Boop-a-Doop, Boop-a-Doop, Boop-a-Doop
If they say I'm too old for you
--- Unknown ---
Then I shall answer "Why, sir,
One never drinks the wine that's new
The old wine tastes much nicer
--- Unknown ---
A gentleman never feels too weak
To pat a pink arm or pinch a cheek
And it's never too late to fall in love
--- Unknown ---
Sez who? Sez me
Sez you? Sez we.
Sez both of us together
--- Unknown ---
It's never too late to whisper words
Concerning the way of bees and birds
And it's never too late to fall in love
Whack-a-do, Whack-a-do, Whack-a-do
--- Unknown ---
It's never too late to flirt and spoon
A fiddle that's old is more in tune
And it's never too late to fall in love
Whack-a-do, Whack-a-do, Whack-a-do
The modern artists of today
May paint their picture faster
But when it comes to skill, I say
You can't beat an old master
It's never too late to bill and coo
At any age one and one make two
--- Unknown ---
And it's never too late to fall in
--- Unknown ---
Never too late to fall in
--- Unknown ---
Never too late to fall in
Love
--- Dulcie ---
It's never too late to blow a kiss
especially in a time like this
--- Lord Brockhurst ---
and it's never too late to fall in love
--- Dulcie ---
Vo-de-o, vo-de-o, vo-de-o
--- Lord Brockhurst ---
it's never too late too late for fun and larks
a jolly old flame has lots of sparks
--- Dulcie ---
and it's never too late to fall in love
--- Lord Brockhurst ---
Vo-de-o, vo-de-o, vo-de-o
--- Dulcie ---
the modern buildings that you see
are often most alarming
--- Brockhurst ---
but I am sure that you'll agree
--- Dulcie ---
a ruin
--- Brockhurst ---
can be charming
--- Dulcie ---
it's never too late to be a beau
--- Brockhurst ---
experiences count a lot you know
--- Both ---
and it's never too late to fall in
never to late to fall in-
