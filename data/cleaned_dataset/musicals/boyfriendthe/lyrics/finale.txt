------ Finale ------
--- All ---
We've got to have
We plot to have
for it's so dreary not to have
that certain thing called the Boyfriend
We scheme about
and dream about
and we've been known to scream about
that certain thing called the Boyfriend
Life without us is impossible
and devoid of all charms
No amount of idle gossip'll
keep them out of our arms
We're blue without
can't do without
our dreams just won't come true without
that certain thing called the Boyfriend
--- Unknown ---
I could be happy with you
if you could be happy with me
I'd be contented to live anywhere
what would I care
as long as you were there?
Skies may not always be blue
but one thing is clear as can be
I know that I could be happy with you
My darling
If you could be happy with me,
