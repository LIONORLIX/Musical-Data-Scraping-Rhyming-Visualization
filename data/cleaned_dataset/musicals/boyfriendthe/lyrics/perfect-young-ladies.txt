------ Perfect Young Ladies ------
--- Unknown ---
We're perfect young ladies
Preparing to take
Our places among the noblesse
--- Unknown ---
We're perfect young ladies
Preparing to make
The most of the charms we possess
--- Unknown ---
We're being finished
And our families' wealth
May be diminished
But at least we all have perfect health
And making the grade is our duty, you see
For perfect young ladies are we
--- Unknown ---
We're perfect young ladies
Who hope to attract
A husband whose credit is good
--- Unknown ---
You may be young ladies
But why don't you act
The way that a young lady should?
--- Unknown ---
I've often told you -
Please don't tell us again
I ought to scold you -
But you know it would be quite in vain
--- Unknown ---
For being our maid is your duty, you see
For perfect young ladies are we -
--- Unknown ---
Perfect young ladies, hm!!
--- Unknown ---
Perfect young ladies are we!!!!
