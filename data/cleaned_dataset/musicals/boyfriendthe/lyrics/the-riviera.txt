------ The Riviera ------
--- Bobby and Maisy ---
When trouble troubles you
the only thing to do
is dance, you simply gotta dance
--- All ---
And if you've had a tiff
you'll soon forget it if you dance
you simply gotta dance
Here in the south of France
they've got a new step
it's quite the cutest dance invented to step
so do step
--- Girls ---
Wriggle your hips and kick up your heels
you'll be suprised how lovely it feels
--- All ---
Ev'rybody's doing the Riviera
--- Boys ---
Wiggle your fingers, wiggle your toes
Just how it started nobody knows
--- All ---
Ev'rybody's doing the Riviera
Multi Millionaires and their little pets do it
Even maiden ladies who wear lorgnettes
have taken to it
Tell ev'ryone to give out the news
this is the way to shake off the blues
Ev'rybody's doing the Riviera
Tell ev'ryone to give out the news
this is the way to shake off the blues
Ev'rybody's doing the Riviera
Get on the dance floor, get in the swing
this is the time for having a fling
Everybody's doing the Riviera
Clap-a your hands and slap on your thighs
Grin like a goon and roll up your eyes
Ev'rybody's doing the Riviera
All the bright young things and their bright young beaux do it
Even duchesses and their gigalos
have taken to it
Ain't it terrific? Ain't it the top?
You gotta dance right on till you drop
