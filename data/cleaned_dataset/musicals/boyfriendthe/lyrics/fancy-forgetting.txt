------ Fancy Forgetting ------
--- Unknown ---
I still recall so tenderly
The night when first we met
The memory's so dear to me
So how can you forget?
--- Unknown ---
Fancy forgetting
The love that we knew
When we were fancy free
Fancy forgetting
What I said to you
And what you said to me
--- Unknown ---
Though the years go by
And our youth is gone
Memories don't die
Like a song they linger on
So just when I thought you'd remember it, too,
Fancy, just fancy you forgetting.
--- Unknown ---
Though the years go by
And our youth is gone
Memories don't die
Like a song they linger on
So just when I thought you'd remember it, too,
