------ Won't You Charleston With Me? ------
--- Unknown ---
Listen, baby, to my plea
Won't you come dancing with me?
Be my baby and say yes
Or else I'm done for, I guess
To dance with you is thrilling to my poor ego
So baby, say you're willing to
Shake a leg, oh
--- Unknown ---
Won't you Charleston with me?
Won't you Charleston with me?
And while the band is playing that
Old vo-de-o-do
Around we will go
Together we'll show them
How the Charleston is done
We'll surprise everyone
Just think what Heaven it's going to be
If you will Charleston, Charleston with me

Just think what Heaven it's going to be
If you will Charleston, Charleston with me
