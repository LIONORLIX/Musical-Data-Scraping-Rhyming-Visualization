------ I Could Be Happy With You ------
--- Unknown ---
I don't claim that I am psychic
But one look at you and I kick
Away every scruple
I learnt as a pupil
In school my dear
--- Unknown ---
I'm not one to make predictions
But I've thrown off all restrictions,
And I don't mind confessing
I think it's a blessing
That you are here
--- Unknown ---
Though I'm prepared to find I'm wrong
I've got a funny feeling we belong together
--- Unknown ---
I could be happy with you
If you could be happy with me
--- Unknown ---
I'd be contented to live anywhere
What would I care
As long as you were there?
--- Unknown ---
Skies may not always be blue
--- Unknown ---
But one thing is clear as can be
--- Unknown ---
I know that I could be happy with you, my darling
--- Unknown ---
If you could be happy with me.
--- Unknown ---
I could be happy with you
If you could be happy with me
I'd be contented to live anywhere
What would I care
As long as you were there?
Skies may not always be blue
But one thing is clear as can be
I know that I could be happy with you, my darling
