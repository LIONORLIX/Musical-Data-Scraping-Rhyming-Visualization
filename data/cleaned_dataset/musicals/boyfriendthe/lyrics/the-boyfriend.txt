------ The Boyfriend ------
--- Unknown ---
Any girl who's reached the age
Of seventeen or thereabouts
Has but one desire in view
She knows she has reached the stage
Of needing one to care about
Nothing else will really do
--- Unknown ---
Childhood games are left behind
And her heart takes wing
Hoping that it soon will find
Just one thing
--- Unknown ---
We've got to have,
We plot to have,
For it's a dreary not to have
That certain thing called The Boy Friend
We scheme about
And dream about
And we've been known to scream about
That certain thing called The Boy Friend
--- Unknown ---
He is really a necessity
If you want to get on
And we might as well confess it
He is a sine qua non
--- Unknown ---
We sigh for him
And cry for him,
And we would gladly die for him
That certain thing called The Boy Friend
--- Unknown ---
We plead to have,
We need to have,
In fact our poor hearts bleed to have
That certain thing called The Boy Friend
We'd save for him
And slave for him
We'd even misbehave for him
That certain thing called The Boy Friend
--- Unknown ---
Life without us is impossible
And devoid of all charms
No amount of idle gossip'll
Keep them out of our arms
We're blue without
Can't do without
Our dreams just won't come true without
That certain thing called The Boy Friend
--- Unknown ---
We're blue without
Can't do without
Our dreams just won't come true without
