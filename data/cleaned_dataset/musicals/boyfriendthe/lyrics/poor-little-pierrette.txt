------ Poor Little Pierrette ------
--- Unknown ---
There is an old French legend
That's set to an old French tune
It tells how Pierrot loved Pierrette
Under a Summer moon
Ev'ry night the lovers meet
Just as the clock strikes nine
Then he gives her kisses sweet
As vintage wine
But, alas, one fateful night
Pierrette is forsworn
There she stands forlorn
Till the cold grey dawn
--- Unknown ---
Poor little Pierrette
Where's your Pierrot?
Why are you all alone?
You should be
So fancy-free
Your heart should be high
But instead
You hang your head
And try not to cry
Poor little Pierrette
You mustn't show
Your dream of love has flown
Just keep on dancing
Till the dawn, and then
He may come back again

Poor little Pierrette
Where's your Pierrot?
Why are you all alone?
Ah!!!!
You should be
So fancy-free
Your heart should be high
Ah!!!!
But instead
You hang your head
And try not to cry
Ah!!!!
Poor little Pierrette
You mustn't show
Your dream of love has flown
Ah!!!!
Just keep on dancing
Till the dawn, and then
