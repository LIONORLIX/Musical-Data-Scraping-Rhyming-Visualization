------ Sur La Plage ------
--- Unknown ---
What a lovely day
What a lovely day
For a dip in the sea
Oh, what fun it will be
Won't you come and have a swim with me?
--- Unknown ---
But whatever you do
When I'm swimming with you
Please remember not to go too far
--- Unknown ---
Though you may look cute
In your bathing suit
We don't know who you are
--- Unknown ---
There's no knowing
Who you are going
To meet sur la plage
--- Unknown ---
You may run up against a rajah
Or maybe your man
Will be a poor man
--- Unknown ---
Sal or Susie, cannot be choosey
For here love's a guessing game
--- Unknown ---
Sur la plage, sur la plage
Everyone looks the same
--- Unknown ---
There's no saying
Who may be playing
With you sur la plage
A knight who's left behind his charger
May call you ducky
Won't you be lucky?
In the ocean
You'll find emotion
May play you a funny game
Sur la plage, sur la plage
Ev'ryone looks the -
Ev'ryone looks the -
Ev'ryone looks the same
--- Unknown ---
Sur la plage, sur la plage
Ev'ryone looks the -
Ev'ryone looks the -
