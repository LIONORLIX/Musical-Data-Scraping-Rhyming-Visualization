------ The 'You-Don't-Want-To-Play-With-Me' Blues ------
--- Unknown ---
Percy, Percy, please have mercy
Why must you always be so sad and gloomy?
Why can't you be a little nicer to me?
Cheri, Cheri
Please be merry
When I am trying to be bright and jolly
It isn't nice to be so melancholy
--- Unknown ---
Oh, dear,
I've got the you-don't-want-to-play-with-me-blues
Don't-want-to-play-with-me-blues
It's clear
I've got the you-don't-want-to-play-with-me-blues
Don't-want-to-play-with-me-blues
--- Unknown ---
I am so good
At spreading mirth and joy
But it's no good
With such a sulky boy
I try
To play the game the other fellows all choose
The other fellows all choose
I sigh
Because you always refuse
What is a girl to do
With such a boy as you?
I've got those
Dreary, Weary,
