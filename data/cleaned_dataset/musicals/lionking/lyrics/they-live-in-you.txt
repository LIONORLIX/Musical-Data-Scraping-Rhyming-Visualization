Night
And the spirit of life
Calling
Mamela
And a voice
With the fear of a child
Asking
Oh, mamela
--- Unknown ---
(Mamela
Mamela yo
Hela)
--- Unknown ---
Wait
There's no mountain too great
Hear these words and have faith
Oh
Have faith
--- Pre-Chorus ---
Hela hey mamela, hela hey mamela
Hela hey mamela, hela
--- Chorus ---
They live in you
They live in me
They're watching over
Everything we see
In every creature
In every star
In your reflection
They live in you
--- Unknown ---
They live in you
They live in me
They're watching over
Everything we see
In every creature
In every star
In your reflection
They live in you
