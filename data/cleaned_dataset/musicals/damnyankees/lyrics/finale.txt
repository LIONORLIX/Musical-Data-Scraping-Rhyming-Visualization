------ Finale ------
--- MEG ---
A woman doesn't know what she has
Until she loses it
When a woman has the love of a man
She abuses it
I didn't know what I had when I
Had my old love
I didn't know what I had 'til
I said, Goodbye old love!
Yes, a woman doesn't know what she has 'til it is
No longer around
--- MEG & JOE ---
But the happy thought is
Whatever it is that's lost
May some day once again
Be
