------ Near to You ------
--- JOE ---
He's near to you
Near to you
Though you think he's far away
He's near to you, so near to you
As near as April is to May!
--- Unknown ---
Can't you feel him there is his favorite chair
Staring at the fireplace
Oh so near to you, always near to you
Why you might as well be face to face
For it's just as though he were standing as close as I
I know it's hard to imagine, but try,
--- Unknown ---
If he's really near to you, near to you
You may be far apart and yet
If he's in your heart
Really in your heart
How near to you can he get?
--- MEG ---
He's near to me, near to me
Even though he's far away
He's near to me, oh so near to me
As near as April is to May
--- JOE ---
If he's really dear to you,
--- MEG ---
He's near to me
--- JOE ---
You may be far apart and yet
--- MEG ---
If he's in my heart
--- JOE ---
Really in your heart
How near to you
--- MEG ---
How near to me
--- BOTH ---
