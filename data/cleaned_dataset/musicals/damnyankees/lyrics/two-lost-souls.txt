------ Two Lost Souls ------
--- JOE & LOLA ---
Two lost souls on the highway of life
We ain't even got a sister or brother
Ain't it just great, ain't it just grand?
We've got each other!
--- Unknown ---
Two lost ships on a stormy sea
One with no sails and one with no rudder
Ain't it just great, ain't it just grand?
We've got each udder!
--- Unknown ---
Two lost sheep, in the wilds of the hills
Far from the other Jacks and Jills, we wandered away and went astray
But we ain't fussin'
Cuz we've got us'n
--- Unknown ---
We're two lost souls on the highway of life
And there's no one with whom we would ruther
Say, Ain't it just great, ain't it just grand?
We've got each other!
--- Unknown ---
Wherever we go, whatever we do
As long as you've got me, and I've got you
We've got each other
