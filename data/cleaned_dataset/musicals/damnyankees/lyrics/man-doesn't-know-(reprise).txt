------ Man Doesn't Know (Reprise) ------
--- JOE ---
A man doesn't know what he has until he loses it,
When a man has the love of a woman he abuses it,
I didn't know what I had when I had my old love,
I didn't know what I had 'till I said, Goodbye, old love!
Yes, a man doesn't know what he has 'til it is no longer around
But the happy thought is
Whatever it is he's lost, may some day once again be found!
--- MEG ---
I know what you mean Joe,
Only too well
For I am lonely just like you
Lonley for my Joe, My sweet Joe
How really sweet I never knew
I really never knew

I didn't know what I had 'till I said, Goodbye old love!
