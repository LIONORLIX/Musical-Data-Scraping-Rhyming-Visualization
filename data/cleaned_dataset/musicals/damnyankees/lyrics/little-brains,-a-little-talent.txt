There isn't a homewrecker on my staff better than you Lola
But this guy is stuborn

Awe come on chief,
you know I've got what it takes
Don't make me brag

I took the zing out of the King of Siam
I took the starch out of the sails
Of the Prince of Wales
It's no great art, gettin' the heart of a man
On a silver platter
A little brains-a little talent
With an emphasis on the latter!
--- Unknown ---
I made mince-meat out of a sweet young farmer!
I knocked the fight out of a knight
When I pierced his armor
And I'll bet, I can upset every male
In a Yale regatta!
A little brains-a little talent
With the emphasis on the latta!
--- Unknown ---
You gotta know just what to say and how to say it
You gotta know what game to play and how to play it
You gotta stack those decks with a couple-a extra aces
And this queen has her aces
In all the right places!

I've done much more than that old bore, Delilah!
I took the curl out of the hair of a millionaire
There is no trick gettin' some hick who is cool
Just a little warmer
A little talent-a little brains
With the emphasis on the former!
--- Unknown ---
Split up a home, way up in Nome, Alaska!
And wrecked the life of every wife
Down in Madagascar
Ask me why weak men'll die for me
Strong men simply shatter
A little brains-a little talent
With an emphasis on the latter!
--- Unknown ---
You gotta know just what to do and how to do it
You gotta know what tea to brew and how to brew it
You've seen the sign that says George Washington once slept here
Well tho' nobody spied him
Guess who was beside him?
Bring out that boy, he'll be a toy to Lola
--- Unknown ---
Just one more case she can erase with that old boffola
What's my plan. same as with any man
I'll, use the standard patter
Plus a little this-a-and a little that-a
