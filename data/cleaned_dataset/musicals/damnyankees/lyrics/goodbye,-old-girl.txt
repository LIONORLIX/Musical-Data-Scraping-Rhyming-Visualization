------ Goodbye, Old Girl ------
--- JOE ---
Goodbye, old girl
My old girl
When you awaken I'll be gone
Can't tell you where I go
It isn't fair, I know
But trust in me and carry on
Goodbyr old friend
My old friend
There's sometin' I must let you know
I haven't said it much
I guess I've lost my touch
But, my old girl, I love you so
No I know it hasn't all been rosy
We've had squabblin' days when tears were brought about
But in a moment or two we would bill and coo
And never even knew
What we fought about
And now you Joe has to go
But he'll come back to you again
So sleep your sleep, old girl
Our love will keep, old girl, till then
My old girl
