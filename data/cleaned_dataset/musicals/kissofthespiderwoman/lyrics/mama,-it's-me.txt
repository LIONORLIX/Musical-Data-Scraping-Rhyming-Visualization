------ Mama, It's Me ------

Mama, it's me
Mama, I'm coming to get you
It won't be much longer
Mama, you'll see
But don't try to talk now
You've got to get stronger
Soon, we'll be going to movies
I'll buy you a beautiful things
Wait till you see what tomorrow brings...
Happiness, mama
You never now where it might be
Mama, it's me. It's me.
Hush, mama. Hush
You've got no reason cry
No, mama, no
