------ A Visit ------
--- Spider Woman ---
Good evening, how've you been?
--- Molina ---
Go away, you know how I've been!
--- Spider Woman ---
I only want to talk, why are you afraid?
--- Molina ---
I've always been afraid of you!
--- Spider Woman ---
But why?
--- Molina ---
I don't know.
--- Spider Woman ---
It will change
Someday you'll recognize
As your friend
--- Molina ---
No, never my friend, go away!
--- Spider Woman ---
But I am beautiful
--- Molina ---
Yes you are!
--- Spider Woman ---
And I am warm and kind and gentle,
Why don't you like me?
--- Molina ---
I don't know!
--- Spider Woman ---
Someday you will understand
I am your friend
Some day you will kiss me
--- Molina ---
Never, never, go away, go away!
--- Spider Woman ---
Someday you'll give in
Of course you will, all men do
Yes, all men kiss me and you will too
You'll part my lips and rest yours there
You'll run your fingers to my hair
Your cries of pleasure
Will heat the cool night air
When you kiss me
And you will kiss me
But not now! Not yet! Not now!
--- Orderlies ---
Ooh...
Now that you have found this perfect place
Permanent delight lights up your face
Never mind the rhumba beat of sweet cocaine
Just change this morbid scene
Take some more morphine
And do ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh,
The Morphine Tango
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh,
