------ Marta ------
--- Valentin ---
There's a cobblestone street
And a little red door
And three flights up is Marta
Waiting there is Marta
--- Prisoners ---
Over the wall
Over the wall
--- Valentin ---
And I still can see us lying together
Talking, smoking, lying together
Helps me through
So I close my eyes
And I hear her step
And I know she's come to hold me
So, my senses stir
--- Prisoners ---
Over the wall
--- Valentin ---
But it's never ever her
It's just a dream of her
--- Prisoners ---
Over the wall
Over the wall
Over the wall
--- Valentin ---
So I close my eyes
And I hear her step
And I know she's come to hold me
So, my senses stir
--- Prisoners ---
Over the wall
Over the wall
--- Valentin ---
But it's never ever her
It's just a dream of her
--- Prisoners ---
And I wonder
