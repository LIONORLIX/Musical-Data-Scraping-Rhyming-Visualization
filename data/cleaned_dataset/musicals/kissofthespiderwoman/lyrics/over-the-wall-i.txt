------ Over The Wall I ------
--- Prisoners ---
There are big busted woman
Over the wall
Over the wall
There are big busted woman
Who bake on the beaches
With oil on their bellies
Over the wall
Over the wall
There is rum from the cane fields
Over the wall
Over the wall
There is sun on my taxi
And cakes in my oven
And fish in my netting
And grease in my barnyard
And big busted woman
Over the wall
Over the wall
Over the wall
And I wonder if I'll ever see them again
--- Spider Woman ---
And the moon grows dimmer
At the tides low ebb
And your breath comes faster
And you're aching to move
