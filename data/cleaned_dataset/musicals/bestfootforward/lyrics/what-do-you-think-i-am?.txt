------ What Do You Think I Am? ------
--- Unknown ---
Something's on my mind so here i go
My personality has changed
Since you saw me last a year ago
My life has been rearranged
I'm not the kid that you heckled when i was freckled and dumb
Why not admit that i'm grown, it's time to own up, my time has come, by gum.
What do you think i am just a baby?
What do you think i am just a child?
I'm getting older and starting to smolder and all that i need is a shove and what do you think i am?
I'm in love!
