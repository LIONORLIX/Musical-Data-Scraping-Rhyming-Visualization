------ Buckle Down, Winsocki ------
--- Unknown ---
Buckle down, Winsocki
Buckle down
You can win, Winsocki
If you knuckle down
If you break their necks
If you make them wrecks
You can break the hex,
So buckle down,
Make 'em yell Winsocki, make 'em yell.
You can win, Winsocki
If you give 'em hell
It you don't give in take it on the chin
You are bound to win, it you will only buckle down,
If you fight you'll chuckle at defeat.
If you fight your luck'll not retreat
Knuckle down Winsocki
Knuckle down.
You can win, Winsocki
If you buckle down
If you mow them down
If you go to town
You can wear the crown
