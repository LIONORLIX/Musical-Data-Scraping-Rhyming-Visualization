------ Goin' Courtin' ------
--- MILLY ---
Goin' courtin', goin' courtin'
Oh it sets your senses in a whirl.
Goin' courtin', goin' courtin'
Dudin' up to go and see your gal.
Oh, it's fun to hunt and shoot a gun,
Or to catch a rabbit on the run
But you'll find it's twice as sportin' goin' courtin'.
Now there's lots o' things you gotta know
Be sure the parlor light is low
Y' sidle up and squeeze her hand
Let me tell you fella's that is grand.
You hem and haw a little while
She gives you kinda half a smile.
You cuddle up she moves away
Then the strategy comes into play.
Goin' courtin', goin' courtin'
If you find it hard to break the ice
Goin' courtin', goin' courtin'
Here's a little feminine advice.
Roll your eyes and heave a little sigh.
Grunt and groan like you're about to die.
That is what's known as emotin' goin' courtin'!
--- BENJAMIN ---
How 'bout parkin parlor's darkin'
And you're longing for a fond embrace
--- DANIEL ---
How 'bout pettin'
How 'bout sofa settin'
--- GIDEON ---
Suppose she up and slaps your face
--- MILLY ---
Just remember blessed are the meek

Don't forget to turn the other cheek,
Soon you'll both be larkin',
Goin' sparkin'?
Goin' dancin'?
--- BOYS ---
Goin' dancin'?
--- MILLY ---
At a fancy ball or minuet.
Goin' dancin',
You'll impress her with your etiquette.
--- FRANK ---
You mean that men are learnin' how to dance?
--- MILLY ---
Yes, it came direct from Paris, France
It'll help with your romancin' goin' dancin'.
--- BROTHERS ---
Goin' courtin', goin' courtin'
Oh, it sees your senses in a whirl
Goin' courtin', goin' courtin'
Duddin' up to go and see your girl.
Oh it's fun to shoot a gun
Or to catch a rabbit on the run,
But you'll find it's twice as sportin'
Goin' courtin'.
--- MILLY ---
Keep your fishin'
--- BROTHERS ---
And fussin'
--- MILLY ---
And fightin'
--- BROTHERS ---
And cussin'
--- ALL ---
And trappin'
