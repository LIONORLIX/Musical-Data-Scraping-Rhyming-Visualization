------ Love Never Goes Away ------
--- ADAM ---
Look at you,
Like a lost little calf
I don't mean to laugh or tease you.
Where's your sense there are so many girls
With long golden curls to please you.
Love comes and goes away,
You're hurtin' bad tonight.
Oh, love comes and goes away,
I'm older ain't I always led you right.
--- GIDEON ---
Alice isn't just any girl.
--- ADAM ---
I know that love's not a game.
--- GIDEON ---
Alice isn't just any girl.
--- ADAM ---
At heart ev'ry girl's the same,
Ev'ry girl's the same.
--- GIDEON ---
Not her, not her.
--- ADAM ---
Love comes and goes away
You're hurtin' bad tonight.
Oh love comes and goes away
I'm older ain't I always led you right?
--- MILLY ---
I could run but the feeling is there.
No place anywhere can hide me,
I'm in love and I don't have a chance
I can't stop that voice inside me.
Love never goes away,
It plays on like a song.
Oh, love never goes away,
He holds me and I know where I belong.
--- GIDEON ---
Alice isn't just any girl
I know that love's not a game.
--- MILLY ---
Adam isn't any man
--- ADAM ---
At heart ev'ry girl's the same,
They are all the same
--- GIDEON ---
Not her, not her
--- MILLY ---
Not him, not him
--- ADAM ---
He'll see, he'll see
--- MILLY ADAM GIDEON ---
Love never goes away It goes away I love Alice
It plays on like a song. Comes and goes away. This feeling
Can't be wrong.
Oh love never goes away I love Alice
You can't get free In time you'll see You can't get free
When you're in love You'll look at love When you're in love
