------ Sobbin' Women ------
--- ADAM ---
Tell ya 'bout them sobbin' women
Who lived in the Roman days.
It seems that they all went swimmin'
While their men was off to graze.
Well, a Roman troop was ridin' by
And saw them in their me oh my,
So they took 'em all back home to dry.
Least that's what Plutarch says.
Oh yes!
Them a woman was sobbin', sobbin', sobbin'
Fit to be tied.
Ev'ry muscle was throbbin', throbbin'
From that riotous ride.
Oh they cried and kissed and kissed and cried
All over that Roman countryside
So don't forget that when you're takin' a bride.
Sobbin' fit to be tied
From that riotous ride!
They never did return their plunder
The victor gets all the loot.
They carried them home, by thunder,
To rotundas small but cute.
And you've never seens so,
They tell me, such downright domesticity.
With a Roman baby on each knee
Named Claudius and Brute
--- SIX BROTHERS ---
Oh yes!
Them a women was sobbin', sobbin', passin' them nights.
--- ADAM ---
While the Romans was goin' out hobbin', nobbin'
Startin' up fights.
They kept occupied by sewin' lots of little old togas
For them tots and sayin' someday women folk'll have rights.
--- GIDEON ---
Passin' all o' them nights.
--- ADAM ---
Just sewin'!
While the Romans had fights.
--- CALEB ---
Hey listen to this
Now when their men folk went to fetch 'em
Them women would not be fetched.
It seems them Romans ketch 'em
That their lady friends stay ketched.
--- ADAM ---
Now let this be because it's true,
A lesson to the likes of you,
Treat 'em rough like them there Romans do
Or else they'll think you're tetched.
--- SIX BROTHERS ---
Oh yes!
Them a women was sobbin', sobbin',
Sobbin' buckets of tears
On account o' old dobbin',
Dobbin' really rattled their ears.
Oh they acted angry and annoyed
--- GIDEON ---
But secretly they was overjoyed
--- ADAM ---
You must recall that when corralin' your streets
--- BROTHERS ---
Oh, oh, oh, oh them poe little dears.
--- SIX BROTHERS ADAM ---
Oh yes
Them a women was sobbin', sobbin', sobbin' Oh yeah
Weepin' a ton Then sobbin' women
Just remember what Robin, Robin, Robin Oh yeah
Hood woulda done. Them sobbin women.
We'll be just like them three merry men
And make 'em all merry once again.
--- ADAM ---
And though they'll be a sobbin' for a while
--- ALL ---
Oh yes!
