------ Woman Ought to Know Her Place ------
--- ADAM ---
I'm leavin' here I'm gettin' out
I won't have any woman takin' over.
She's gonna have to learn
I ain't no holy coddle she can shove around.
No more tellin' me what I can do or think,
When to smoke when to cuss and what to drink.
Ever since the wedding she's tried to hold the reins,
No one's puttin' me in chains.
A woman ought to know her place.
A place she's had since time began.
A woman ought to know her place is behind her man
Is behind her man.
She's figurin' we share a bed
So she can twist me round her little finger.
I've seen her try to change my brothers
But God she won't change me.
The boys took what belonged to them they meant no harm.
She was wrong to throw me out it ain't her farm.
She was smart and foxy full of woman's wiles
Foolin' me with girlish smiles.
A woman ought to know her place,
And give her husband all she can.
When will Milly learn her place is behind her mind?
And after all I married her,
A waitress with no living kin.
She thinks I'll beg on bended knee,
But when I don't come home
She'll see, she'll see.
A woman's got to know her place.
Milly's got to learn her place
