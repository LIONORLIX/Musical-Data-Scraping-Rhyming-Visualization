--- ADAM ---
Bless your beautiful hide,
Bless your beautiful hide.
Bless your beautiful hide
Wherever you may be.
We ain't met yet
But I'm a willin' to bet
You're the gal for me.
Bless your beautiful hide
You're just as good as lost.
I don't know your name
But I'm a-stakin' my claim
Lest your eyes is crossed.
Oh, I'd swap my gun 'n' I'd swap my mule
Tho' whoever took it would be one big fool.
Or pay your way thru cookin' school.
If 'n you would say I do.
Bless your beautiful hide
Prepare to bend your knee.
And take that vow
Cause I'm tellin' you now,
You're the gal for me.
Pretty and trim but kinda slim.
Heavenly eyes but oh that size,
She's gotta be right to be the bride for me.
Bless her beautiful hide
Wherever she may be.
Bless your beautiful hide
Wherever you may be.
We ain't met yet but I'm a willin' to bet
