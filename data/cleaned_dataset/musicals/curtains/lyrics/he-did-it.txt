------ He Did it ------

(snoring)
--- GEORGIA ---
You can?t sleep either
--- BOBBY ---
Knowing that somebody in this company is a killer
I thought I saw our Director sneakin? around
--- GEORGIA ---
Murder is a very British thing, isn?t it.
I mean, it?s almost like a hobby over there
--- BOBBY ---
Yeah, you know if I had to bet
I?d say he did it
--- ENSEMBLE ---
Ahhhhhh
He did it He did it He did it He did it He did it He did it
I?m sure
Although he appears with his posture and pious
His principles hardly are pure
--- Unknown ---
It isn?t a stretch to believe it
That murderous motive was his
He did it He did it
He did it then hid it
And now he is off to a pris-on
--- NIKI ---
You can?t sleep either
--- AARON ---
Know that somebody in this company is a killer
I thought I saw Bambi sneaking around
Maybe she killed Jessica so that you could take over the lead
And Bambi could have your part
--- NIKI ---
Oh, that?s silly.
She should have just killed me
I never said that
--- AARON ---
If you ask me
She did it
--- ENSEMBLE ---
Ahhhhhh
She did it She did it She did it She did it She did it She did it
I know
With laughter she hung him
And after she strung him
He swung like a yo-yo High Low
--- Unknown ---
The facts are not really surprising
Our morals are probably loose
She did it She did it
She did it then hid it
And now she is off to the hoose-gow
--- Unknown ---
OSCAR/CHRISTOPHER
Ahhhh
--- OSCAR ---
You can?t sleep either
--- CHRISTOPHER ---
Knowing that somebody in this company is gonna change my blocking
--- OSCAR ---
I think I saw Aaron and Georgia sneakin? around
--- CHRISTOPHER ---
Yeah, some writing teams are always plottin? on how to do in the director
And they?re all quite, quite mad
I could easily believe that they did it
--- ENSEMBLE ---
Ahhhhhh
They did it They did it They did it They did it
I?ve worked with those losers before
They went right ahead
And they slaughtered two people
The same way they slaughtered the score
--- Unknown ---
Well, this is the end of their output
Their future is not worth a thing
They did it They did it
They did it then hid
And soon they?ll be going to sing-sing
--- ENSEMBLE ---
