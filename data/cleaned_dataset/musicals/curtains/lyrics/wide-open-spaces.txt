Wide Open Spaces
--- All (sung) ---
Wide open spaces
Everywhere I look I see
Those wide open spaces
Where the future waits for you and me
It's Kansas forever
And wherever I may roam
I?ll see those wide open spaces
And know that Kansas is home
--- Jessica (spoken) ---
Kiss me while you can boys, I?m bidding you ?
--- Randy ---
Farewell.
--- Jessica ---
Farewell. I?m bidding you farewell.
I see someone taking aim at this here target.
--- Randy ---
But he can?t win.
There?s already a bullet smack-dab in the middle of the bulls-eye.
--- Jessica ---
Why he shot that other bullet in half.
--- Nikki ---
No, not quite yet!
--- Jessica ---
Why he shot that other bullet in half.
--- Randy ---
The school-house is saved!
--- Bambi ---
Look! It?s Rob Hood!
--- Jessica ---
I wonder what face belongs to those lips I long to kiss?
--- Bobby ---
This face!
--- Nikki ---
Why you?re Allen O?Dell! That friendly lawman from the East I was so crazy about!
I thought you were all done with us?
--- Bobby ---
Not when I finally found myself a home, a place to where
I belong keeping company with the people I care most about.
--- Randy ---
You came to us as a stranger, rid this place of crime, and gave us a new hope in ourselves.
That?s gonna be one tough act to follow!
--- Bobby ---
Well, how?s this?will you be my lawful wedded wife, Miss Nancy?
--- Nikki ---
Oh, yes I will!
--- All (sung) ---
Ding dong, Ding dong
Ding dong, Ding dong
Wide open spaces
Everywhere I look I see
Those wide open spaces
Where the future waits for you and me
--- Jessica (sung badly) ---
It?s Kansas forever
--- All (sung) ---
And wherever I may roam
I?ll see those wide open spaces
And know that Kansas is home
K-A-N-S-A-S USA!
--- Bambi (spoken) ---
Oh my God, she fainted!
--- Nikki ---
Shall I call the doctor?
--- Johnny ---
No, Boston Hospital is just down the block. It?s okay, she?s got a pulse.
--- Ronny ---
That?s the first time she?s ever kept a beat.
--- Johnny ---
Bobby, Ronny, can you help carry her?
--- Bobby ---
