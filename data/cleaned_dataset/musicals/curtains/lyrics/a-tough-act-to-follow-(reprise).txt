------ A Tough Act to Follow (Reprise) ------
--- Chorus ---
You and I,
We could stay
A tough act to follow
In every way
--- Niki Harris and Frank Cioffi ---
If you hold my hand
And let the music start,
Let the curtains part,
Let the spotlight glow,
--- Chorus ---
We'd be a tough act to follow
A tough act to follow
A tough act to follow
