------ I Miss the Music ------
--- Cioffi (spoken) ---
You see what I'm saying? The song itself is kind of lackluster. It lacks ..
--- Chris ---
Yes?
--- Cioffi ---
Luster.
--- Chris ---
I agree. We need a completely new composition,
one that's catchier than pink eye. I'll leave you to it.
--- Cioffi ---
Well, at least now you'll have a few minutes alone with your piano.
--- Aaron ---
Alone, yeah.
--- Cioffi ---
Could I ask, only because
I've wondered this my entire life--which would normally come first,
the music or the lyric?
--- Aaron ---
Same answer as the chicken or the egg.
--- Cioffi ---
Ah, so it's the lyric.
--- Aaron ---
No. It can start with a note.
Which can become a phrase.
And then you try hanging words off each branch, like trimming a tree.
--- Cioffi ---
Sounds easy enough.
--- Aaron ---
Really? Well don't talk about love
Or you'll have to say fits like a glove
Or As certain as push comes to shove
You will pine for the woman you're constantly thinking of
You see the problem.
--- Cioffi ---
Dangling participle. So you suggest staying away from love?
--- Aaron ---
At all costs. And don't mention your life
Or you'll have to say cuts like a knife
Or refer to the heartbreak and strife
When you find that you're missing your ...
--- Cioffi ---
Missing?
--- Aaron ---
What?
--- Cioffi ---
You were saying what you miss.
--- Aaron ---
No I meant that, well ...
(sung)I miss the music
I miss the song
Since she?s not with me
It comes out wrong
It doesn?t matter
How hard I try
I?ve lost the music
I don?t know why
You may have known
Before I met her
I wrote alone
But if you ask me
What I prefer
I?d say the music
I wrote with her
When you?re writing a song
And you?ve a partner
The room is filled with jokes and chatter
She says something
You say something
She writes a line
You play a vamp
But when you?re writing a song
Without a partner
That?s a completely different matter
No one tells you ?That?s not funny?
No one says ?Let?s cut that bar?
No one makes you better than you are
I can?t pretend
I miss the music
I miss my friend
No need to ask me
What I prefer
I choose the music
I wrote with her
I liked the music
I made with ?
--- Georgia (spoken) ---
Aaron, I forgot my lyric. Can you believe it? Me.
--- Aaron ---
Well you?re not the lyricist now, you?re the star.
Georgia? Break a leg.
--- Georgia ---
Thanks. You can finish the song without me?
--- Aaron ---
I?m a one-man band.
I miss the music
I miss my friend
No need to ask me
What I prefer
I choose the music
I wrote with her
I loved the music
