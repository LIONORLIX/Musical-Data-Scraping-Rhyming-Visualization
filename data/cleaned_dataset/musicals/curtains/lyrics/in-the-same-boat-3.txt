------ In The Same Boat 3 ------
--- Unknown ---
The sea's unusually rough
The going's terribly tough
As if that wasn't enough
They've lost an oar
--- Unknown ---
They find it all they can do
To calm the craft
Furthermore little chum
They're so dumb
That they don't
Know their fore
From their aft
--- Unknown ---
The waves are lappin' a lot
The sharks are snappin' a lot
The thunder's clapping' a lot
Just hear it roar
--- Unknown ---
But there's no doubt in the world
They'll stay afloat
'cause it's easy to win
Take it all on the chin
When you're in the same boat
