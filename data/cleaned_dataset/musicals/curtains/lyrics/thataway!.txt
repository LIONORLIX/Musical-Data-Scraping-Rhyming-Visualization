------ Thataway! ------
--- GEORGIA ---
Kiss me while you can boys
I?m gonna round up that Robb Hood
And hog tie his fancy McNancy
He made a getaway
He left me flataway
At times like this a modern miss should gallop thataway
When love goes thisaway
Don?t blow your blissaway
You might find out that
He?s just about a hug and kissaway
No matter whichaway
He takes that bitchaway
I won?t relent til he?ll consent to make a switchaway
If he?s in Santa Fe
Or in Piscataway
I?ll pack my gown and leave this town and travel thataway
--- Unknown ---
If he?s in Paraguay
Or even Mandalay
I?ll grab my horse and set my course to reach him thataway
--- Unknown ---
I?ve know a man or two
A score or more, it?s true
And if he stays or if he strays depends on my lasso
It ain?t just how you woo?em
But how you proceed to purse?em

If you?re the mate for him,
Don?t sit and wait for him!
--- GEORGIA ---
It?s up to you but if you do you?ll be too late for him.
If there?s a spataway,
Don?t throw his hataway!
--- BOTH ---
Forget that fight, and hold him tight
--- GEORGIA ---
till he gets thataway!
--- MEN ---
