------ In the Same Boat 2 ------
--- Unknown ---
Here we are
My shipmates and me
Lost on a windy sea
All the planks are springin' a leak
We'd like to bail
But we forgot the pail
And we regret to say
Our compass is gone
But somehow we still sail on
Because two heads
Are best, as some fellow wrote
And what the heck, we're in the same boat!
