------ Thinking of Him ------
--- Georgia ---
Thinking of him
Thinking of him
Sometimes it seems I spend every moment of my waking day
Thinking of him
Making him laugh, sometimes
Making him strong, sometimes
Making him feel some place in the light is his
Telling him just how special he is
Thinking of him
Thinking of him
Telling the truth when no one is willing to tell him the truth
Fighting for him
Living for him
Thinking it over, that?s what I think I do
Well isn?t it time
--- Aaron ---
Isn?t it time
--- Georgia ---
Isn?t it high time
I was thinking of me, too
--- Aaron ---
Maybe it?s time
--- Bobby (interrupts Aaron) ---
Maybe it?s time
Maybe it?s high time
You were thinking of you
--- Georgia ---
Thinking of me
--- Georgia and Bobby ---
