You're a mean one Mr Grinch
You really are a heel
You`re as cuddly as a cactus
You're as charming as an eel
Mr. Grinch
You`re a bad banana with a greasy black peel
--- Unknown ---
You're a monster Mr. Grinch
Your Hearts an empty hole
Your brain is full of spiders
You?ve got garlic in your soul Mr. Grinch
I wouldn?t touch you with a
39 and a half Foot pole

You?re a vile one Mr. Grinch
You have termites in your smile
You have all the tender sweetness of a seasick crocodile
Mr. Grinch
Given the choice between the two of you
I?d take the a seasick crocodile
--- Unknown ---
You?re a foul one Mr. Grinch
You?re a nasty wasty skunk

Your soul is full of gunk
Mr. Grinch

The 3 words that best describe you, are as follows, and I quote
Stink, Stank, Stonk
--- Unknown ---
You?re a rotter Mr. Grinch
You?re the king of sinful sots
Your hearts a dead tomato splotched with moldy purple spots
Mr. Grinch
--- Unknown ---
Your sole is an appalling dump heap
Overflowing with the most disgraceful
Assortment of deplorable rubbish
Imaginable, mangled up in tangled up knots
--- Unknown ---
You nauseate me, Mr. Grinch
With a nauseous super naus
You?re a crooked jerky jockey and,
you drive a crooked horse
Mr. Grinch

You?re a 3 Decker sour kraut and toad stool sandwich
