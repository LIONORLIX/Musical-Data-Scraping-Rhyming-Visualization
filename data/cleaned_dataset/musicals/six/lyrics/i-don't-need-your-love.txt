------ I Don't Need Your Love ------
--- Catherine Parr: ---
You know I love you, boy
In every single way
Though I love you, boy
I'll miss you every day
Oh I love you, boy
I wish that I could stay with you
And keep the life I made with you
And even though this feels so right
I'm holding back the tears tonight
--- Unknown ---
It's true I'll never be over you
'Cause I have built a future in my mind with you
And now the hope is gone
There's nothing left for me to do
--- Unknown ---
You know it isn't true
But I must say to you
That I don't need your love, no, no
I don't need your love, no, no
It'll never be better than it was, no, no
But I don't need your love, no, no
--- Unknown ---
I've got no choice
With the King I stay alive
Never had a choice
Been a wife twice before, just to survive
I don't have a choice
If Henry says It's you, then it's you
No matter how I feel
It's what I have to do
But if, somehow, I had that choice
No holding back, I'd raise my voice
--- Unknown ---
I'd say "Henry, yeah it's true
I'll never belong to you
'Cause I am not your toy, to enjoy till there's something new
As if I'm gonna give up my boy, my work, my dreams
To care for you
--- Unknown ---
"Ha, darling, get a clue
There's nothing you can do
I don't need your love, no, no
No, I don't need you love, no, no
There's nothing left to discuss, no, no
But I don't need your love, no, no
--- Unknown ---
But I can't say that
Not to the king
So this is goodbye
All my love
Catherine
--- Unknown ---
So I sent that letter to my love
Got married to the king
Became the one who survived
I've told you about my life
The final wife
But why should that story
Be the one I have to sing about
Just to win? I'm out
That's not my story
There's so much more
--- Unknown ---
Remember that I was a writer
I wrote books and psalms and meditations
Fought for female education
So all my women could independently
Study scripture
I even got a woman to paint my picture
Why can't I tell that story?
'Cause in history
I'm fixed as one of six
And without him
I disappear
We all disappear
--- Ensemble: ---
So we had no choice
But now it's us alone
So we've got no choice
No, we've got no choice
We're taking back the microphone
I'm gonna raise my voice
They always said:
We need your love
But it's time for us to rise above
--- Unknown ---
It's not what went down in history
But tonight I'm singing this for me
--- Unknown ---
Henry, yeah, I'm through
Too many times it's been told
And I have had enough
Love stories to get old
And you might think it's tough
But I've got to let your love run cold
We're taking back control (we're taking back control)
You need to know
--- Unknown ---
I don't need your love, no, no
No, I don't need your love, no, no
Can't let it get the better of us, no, no
I don't need your love, no, no
I don't need your love, no, no
No, I don't need your love, no, no
I don't need your love, no, no
I don't need your love
