------ Get Down ------
--- Anne Of Cleves: ---
Sittin' here all alone
On a throne
In a palace that I happen to own
Bring me some pheasant
Keep it on the bone
--- Unknown ---
Fill my goblet up to the brim
Sippin' on mead and I spill it on my dress
With the gold lace trim
Not very prim and proper
Can't make me stop
--- Unknown ---
I wanna go hunting, any takers?
I'm not fake 'cause I've got acres and acres
Paid for with my own riches
Where my hounds at? Release the bitches
Everyday
Head back for a round of croquet, yeah
'Cause I'm a player
And tomorrow, I'll hit replay
--- Unknown ---
You, you said that I tricked ya
'Cause I, I didn't look like my profile picture
Too, too bad I don't agree
So I'm gonna hang it up for everyone to see
And you can't stop me 'cause
--- Unknown ---
I'm the queen of the castle
Get down, you dirty rascal
Get down
Get down
Get down you dirty rascal
Get down
Get down
'Cause I'm the queen of the castle
--- Unknown ---
When I get bored
I go to court
Pull up outside in my carriage
Don't got no marriage
So I have a little flirt with the footman
As he takes my fur
As you were
--- Unknown ---
Making my way to the dance floor
Some boys make an advance
I ignore them
'Cause my jam comes on the lute
Lookin' cute
Das ist gut
--- Unknown ---
All eyes on me
No criticism
I look more rad than Lutheranism
--- Unknown ---
Dance so hard that I'm causin' a sensation
Okay ladies, let's get in reformation
--- Unknown ---
You, you said that I tricked ya
'Cause I, I didn't look like my profile picture
Too, too bad I don't agree
So I'm gonna hang it up for everyone to see
And you can't stop me 'cause
--- Unknown ---
I'm the queen of the castle
Get down, you dirty rascal
Get down
Get down (you dirty rascal)
Get down
Get down
'Cause I'm the queen of the castle
--- Unknown ---
Now I ain't sayin' I'm a gold digger
But check my prenup, and go figure
Got gold chains
Symbolic of my faith to the higher power
In the fast lane
My horses can trot up to twelve miles an hour
Let me explain
I'm a Wienerschnitzel, not an English flower
No one tells me I need a rich man
Doin' my thing in my palace in Richmond
--- Unknown ---
You, you said that I tricked ya (tricked ya)
'Cause I (I), I didn't look like my profile picture (no no)
Too, too bad I don't agree (too bad I don't agree)
So I'm gonna hang it up (hang it up, hang it up) for everyone to see
And you can't stop, you can't stop me 'cause
--- Unknown ---
I'm the queen of the castle
Get down, you dirty rascal
Get down (yeah, c'mon, ha!)
Get down (get down with me)
Get down you dirty rascal
Get down (it's Anna of Cleves)
Get down (ow!)
