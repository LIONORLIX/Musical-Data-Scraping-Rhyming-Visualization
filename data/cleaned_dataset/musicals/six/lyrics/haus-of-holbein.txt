------ Haus of Holbein ------
--- Unknown ---
Welcome to the house
To the Haus of Holbein
Ja, ooh ja, das ist gut
Ooh ja, ja
The Haus of Holbein
--- Unknown ---
Hans Holbein goes around the world
Painting all of the beautiful girls
From Spain, to France
And Germany
The king chooses one
But which one will it be?
--- Unknown ---
You bring the corsets
We'll bring the cinches
No one wants a waist over nine inches
So what the make up contains lead poison?
At least your complexion will bring all the boys in
--- Unknown ---
Ignore the fear and you'll be fine
We'll turn this vier into a nine
So just say 'ja' and don't say 'nein'
--- Unknown ---
'Cause now you're in the house
In the Haus of Holbein!
Ja, ooh ja, das ist gut
Ooh ja, ja
The Haus of Holbein
--- Unknown ---
We must make sure the princesses look great
When their time comes for the Holbein portrait
We know what all the best inventions are
To hold everything up
Ja, it's wunderbar
--- Unknown ---
For blonder hair, then you just add a
Magical ingredient from your bladder
Try these heels, so high it's naughty
But we cannot guarantee that you'll still walk at forty
--- Unknown ---
Ignore the fear and you'll be fine
We'll turn this vier into a nine
So just say 'ja' and don't say 'nein'
--- Unknown ---
'Cause now you're in the house
In the Haus of Holbein!
--- Unknown ---
Ooh ja, das ist gut
Ooh ja, ja
