That we used to be six wives
...but now we're ex-wives

Like it's the Renaissance
Everybody knows

...but now we're ex-wives

Divorced
--- Catherine Of Aragon: ---
My name is Catherine Of Aragon
Was married 24 years, I'm a paragon
Of royalty, my loyalty is to the Vatican
So if you try to dump me
You won't try that again
--- All: ---
Beheaded
--- Anne Boleyn: ---
I'm that Boleyn girl
And I'm up next, see
I broke England from the Church
Yeah, I'm that sexy
Why did I lose my head?
Well my sleeves may be green
But my lipstick's red!
--- All: ---
Died

Jane Seymour, the only one he truly loved

When my son was newly born
I died, but I'm not what I seem
Or am I?
Stick around and you'll
Suddenly see more...

But I didn't look as good
As I did in my pic
Funny how we all discuss that
But never Henry's little...
--- Katherine Howard: ---
Prick up your ears, I'm the Katherine
Who lost her head
--- All: ---
Beheaded
--- Katherine Howard: ---
For my promiscuity outside of wed
Lock up your husbands
Lock up your sons
K Howard is here
And the fun's begun
--- All: ---
Survived

Five down, I'm the final wife

How we got this far
--- All: ---
Do you wanna know how we got this far?

But now we're ex-wives!
