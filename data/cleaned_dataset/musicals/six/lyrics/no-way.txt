--- Catherine Of Aragon: ---
There's no way
You must agree that baby
In all the time I've been by your side
I've never lost control
No matter how many times I knew you lied
Have my golden rule
Got to keep my cool
Yeah, baby
--- Ensemble: ---
You know she's got to keep her cool
--- Catherine Of Aragon: ---
And even though you've had your fun
Running around with some pretty young thing
And even though you've had one son
With someone who don't own a wedding ring
No matter what I heard
I didn't say a word, no, baby

So you read a bible verse that I'm cursed
'Cause I was your brothers wife
You say it's a pity 'cause quoting leviticus
I'll end up kiddy-less all my life
Well daddy weren't you there
When I gave birth to Mary? aw hi baby

You've got me down on my knees
Please tell me what you think I've done wrong
Been humble, been loyal, I've tried
To swallow my pride all along
If you can just explain
A single thing I've done to cause you pain, I'll go
