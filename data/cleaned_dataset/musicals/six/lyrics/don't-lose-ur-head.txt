------ Don't Lose Ur Head ------
--- Anne Boleyn: ---
Grew up in the French court
Oui oui bonjour
Life was a chore
So
--- Ensemble: ---
She set sail
--- Anne Boleyn: ---
1522 came straight to the UK
All the British dudes lame
--- Ensemble: ---
Epic fail!
Ooh
--- Anne Boleyn: ---
I wanna dance and sing
--- Ensemble: ---
Politics
--- Anne Boleyn: ---
Not my thing
--- Ensemble: ---
Ooh
--- Anne Boleyn: ---
But then I met the king
And soon my daddy said
You should try and get ahead!
He wanted me, obviously
Messaging me like every day
Couldn't be better then he sent me a letter
And who am I kidding
I was prêt à manger
--- Ensemble: ---
Ooh
--- Anne Boleyn: ---
Sent a reply
--- Ensemble: ---
Ooh
--- Anne Boleyn: ---
Just saying 'Hi'
--- Ensemble: ---
Ooh
--- Anne Boleyn: ---
'You're a nice guy
I'll think about it maybe
XO baby'
--- Ensemble: ---
Uh oh
--- Anne Boleyn: ---
Here we go
--- Ensemble: ---
You sent him kisses
--- Anne Boleyn: ---
I didn't know I would move in with his missus
--- Ensemble: ---
What?!
--- Anne Boleyn: ---
Get a life!
--- Ensemble: ---
You're living with his wife
--- Anne Boleyn: ---
Like, what was I meant to do?
Sorry, not sorry 'bout what I said
I'm just trying to have some fun
Don't worry, don't worry
Don't lose your head
I didn't mean to hurt anyone
LOL Say 'Oh, well!'
Or go to hell!
I'm sorry, not sorry 'bout what I said
Don't lose your head
--- Unknown ---
Three in the bed
And the little one said
If you wanna be wed
Make up your mind!
Her or me, chum
Don't wanna be some
Girl in a threesome
Are you blind?
--- Ensemble: ---
Ooh
--- Anne Boleyn: ---
Don't be bitter
--- Ensemble: ---
Ooh
--- Anne Boleyn: ---
'Cause I'm fitter
--- Ensemble: ---
Ooh
--- Anne Boleyn: ---
Why hasn't it hit her?
He doesn't wanna bang you
Somebody hang you
--- Ensemble: ---
Uh oh
--- Anne Boleyn: ---
Here we go
--- Ensemble: ---
Your comment went viral
--- Anne Boleyn: ---
I didn't really mean it
But rumours spiral
--- Ensemble: ---
Wow Anne, way to make the country hate you!
--- Anne Boleyn: ---
Mate, what was I meant to do?
Sorry, not sorry about what I said
I'm just trying to have some fun
Don't worry, don't worry
Don't lose your head
I didn't mean to hurt anyone
LOL Say 'Oh, well!'
Or go to hell!
I'm sorry, not sorry 'bout what I said
Don't lose your head

Tried to elope
But the Pope said 'Nope!'
Our only hope was Henry
He got a promotion
Caused a commotion
Set in motion the C of E
--- Ensemble: ---
The rules
--- Anne Boleyn: ---
Were so outdated
Us two wanted to get X-rated
--- Ensemble: ---
Soon
Excommunicated
--- Anne Boleyn: ---
Everybody chill
It's totes God's will
--- Unknown ---
Henry's out every night on the town
Just sleeping around like What the hell?
If that's how it's gonna be
Maybe I'll flirt with a guy or three
Just to make him jel
Henry finds out and he goes mental
He screams and shouts like
So judgemental!
You damned witch
Mate, just shut up!
I wouldn't be such a b...
If you could get it up
--- Ensemble: ---
Uh oh
--- Anne Boleyn: ---
Here we go
--- Ensemble: ---
Is that what you said?
--- Anne Boleyn: ---
And now he's going 'round like
Off with her head!
--- Ensemble: ---
No!
--- Anne Boleyn: ---
Yeah, I'm pretty sure he means it
--- Ensemble: ---
Seems it
--- Anne Boleyn: ---
What was I meant to do?
--- Ensemble: ---
What was she meant to do?
--- Anne Boleyn: ---
Like, what was I meant to do?
--- Ensemble: ---
What was she meant to do?
--- Anne Boleyn: ---
No, but what was I meant to do?
Sorry, not sorry about what I said
I'm just trying to have some fun
Don't worry, don't worry
Don't lose your head
I didn't mean to hurt anyone
LOL Say 'Oh, well!'
Or go to hell!
--- Ensemble: ---
Just go to hell!
--- Anne Boleyn: ---
Sorry, not sorry about what I said
--- Ensemble: ---
Sorry, not sorry about what she said
--- Anne Boleyn: ---
Sorry, not sorry about what I said
