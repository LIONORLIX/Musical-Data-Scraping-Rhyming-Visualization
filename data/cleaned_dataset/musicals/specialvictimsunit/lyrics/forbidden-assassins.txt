------ Forbidden Assassins ------
--- JOHN ---
I'm John Hinkley
You are Stephen Sondheim on high
Stephen
Tell me Stephen how I should sing your words
I would do passion, I could do Follies, I would play Sweeney Todd for you
He liked to kill people too
--- Unknown ---
I am unworthy of your words
Stephen darling
Let me prove worthy of your words
You are a king to theater nerds just like me
But I'm as baffled as can be
--- SQUEAKY ---
I am squeaky
You are every lunatic's god
Stephen
Charlie Manson applauds me and your words
Words like solpruder
Words like Dick Nixon
I will assassinate on cue
If that's what you want me to do
--- Unknown ---
I am unworthy of your words
Stephen darling
All of your fans walk out in herds
Let me be worthy of your complex meoldies
--- JOHN ---
Teach me to count in five-four time
--- SQUEAKY ---
Put me through music theory hell
--- JOHN ---
Cut me with every perfect rhyme
--- SQUEAKY ---
Couldn't you just write Carousel
--- BOTH ---
What is that dotted note? (I have a ravaged throat)
Even though (Even though)
I will always know
--- Unknown ---
I am unworthy of your words
Stephen darling
I cannot sing your minor thirds
I am so tortured
But I now know what to do
I have to turn my gun on you
--- Unknown ---
(gunshot)
--- Unknown ---
Your words
