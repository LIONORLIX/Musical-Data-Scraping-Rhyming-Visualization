------ She Wasn't You ------
--- EDWARD ---
Why did each love melt away before?
Heaven above turn to clay before?
She wasn't you - She wasn't you.
--- Unknown ---
Why did champagne lose its year for me?
Love's haunting strain disappear for me?
What could I do?
She wasn't you.
--- Unknown ---
She wasn't you, and no vows ever chained me.
No, she wasn't you, and goodbyes never pained me.
Now I know why each affair always faded so fast!
Only with you was I born to live;
Only to you is the love I give,
Love for as long as a lifetime can last.
