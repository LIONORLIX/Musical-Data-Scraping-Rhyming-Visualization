--- DR. MARK ---
Hear my voice through the dim.
Feel the waves on your skin.
Like a call from within, come back to me!
Leave behind all you own.
Tell your flowers you will phone.
Let your dog walk alone, come back to me!
--- Unknown ---
Let your tub overflow.
If a date waits below
Let him wait for Godot.
Ride a rail,
Come by mail, COD!
--- Unknown ---
Hang a sign on your door
Out to lunch ever more.
Don't get lost at Korvette's
Or get signed by the Mets
Don't give up cigarettes, come back to me!
Come back to me!
Come back -
--- CHORUS ---
On a clear day
Rise and look around you
And you'll see who you are
On a clear day
How it will astound you
That the glow of your being
Outshines every star
You'll feel part of every mountain sea and shore
You can hear
From far and near
A word you've never, never heard before...
And on a clear day...On a clear day...
You can see forever...
And ever...
And ever...
