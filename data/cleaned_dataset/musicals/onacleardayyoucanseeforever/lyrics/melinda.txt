------ Melinda ------
--- DR. MARK ---
This is a dream, Melinda,
Just a mirage, so they say.
This whole affair they all declare
Was dreamed each step of the way.
--- Unknown ---
You're a mere dream, Melinda,
Out for a gay little spin.
Dealing me lies before my eyes
of days that never have been.
--- Unknown ---
There's no Melinda, they say for sure.
But don't go, Melinda.
I know and you know
That you're no mere dream, Melinda,
Gone when the dawn gleam is through.
You and I know that long ago
before the dream there was you.
There once was you.
--- Unknown ---
There's no Melinda, they say for sure.
But don't go, Melinda.
I know and you know
That you're no mere dream, Melinda,
Gone when the dawn gleam is through.
You and I know that long ago
before the dream there was you.
