------ Don't Tamper With My Sister ------
--- EDWARD ---
Don't tamper with my sister.
Don't tamper with my sister.
Don't tamper with my sister
On the public walke.
Her name would not survive it.
Go yonder where it's private.
And don't arouse my sister
On a public walke.
--- Unknown ---
Nibble on her ear.
Tickle her about the waist.
Tantalize the dear.
Titillate with all due haste.
Doing it out here
I must say is bad taste.
--- Unknown ---
Carry on, old man,
Do your best to do your worst.
Any sort of plan:
Good or bad or vice-a-versed.
Frolic all you can;
But do go elsewhere first!
--- CHORUS ---
Do go elsewhere first!
--- EDWARD ---
Don't tamper with my sister.
Don't tamper with my sister.
Don't tamper with my sister
On a public walke.
'Tis safer to assault her
In China or Gibralter,
But don't have at my sister
On a public walke.
--- CHORUS ---
But don't have at his sister
On a public walke.
--- EDWARD ---
As Cleopatra said
While leaping from her bed:
Great jumping Julius, can't you close the door?
Don Juan had once a royal marriage lined up
Until he left a blonde Venetian's blind up.
--- Unknown ---
A sin is not a sin
Until a sin is seen.
So let us misdemean
Where lights are low.
--- The House of Lords is grand for wooing ---
No one will know what we're doing.
Oh, but here, no, no!
--- CHORUS ---
No! No! No! No!
No! No! No! No!
Don't tamper with my sister.
Don't tamper with my sister.
Don't tamper with my sister
On a public walke.
--- EDWARD ---
A more remote arena
Would keep the gossip cleaner.
--- CHORUS ---
Don't stab at her, don't grab at her.
Don't tamper with my sister
