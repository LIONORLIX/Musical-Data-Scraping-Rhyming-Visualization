------ On a Clear Day (You Can See Forever) ------
--- DR. MARK ---
Could anyone among us
Have an inkling on a clue?
What magic feats, or wizardry
And voodoo you can do?
And who would ever guess
What powers you possess?
And who would have the sense to change his views?
And stop to mind his E.S.P's and Q's
For who would ever dream of hearing phones before they ring,
Or harrowing the earth to send you up a little spring?
Or finding you've been crowned 'The Queen of Lost and Found'
And who would not be stunned to see you prove
There's more to us than surgeons can remove?
--- Unknown ---
So much more than we ever knew,
So much more were we born to do.
Should you draw back the curtain,
This I am certain.
You'll be impressed with you.
--- Unknown ---
On a clear day
Rise and look around you
And you'll see who you are.
On a clear day
How it will astound you
That the glow of your being outshines ev'ry star.
--- Unknown ---
You'll feel part of ev'ry mountain sea and shore.
You can hear, from far and near,
A world you've never heard before.
And on a clear day...
On that clear day...
You can see forever and ever more!
