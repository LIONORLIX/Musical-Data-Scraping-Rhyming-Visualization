------ Wait Till We're Sixty-Five ------
--- WARREN ---
Guaranteed income
House with a view
Doctors and nurses
Surgery too.
Everything paid for
And it comes true...
When we're sixty-five.
--- Unknown ---
Ten, twenty, thirty,
Then we're forty
Wait 'til we're sixty-five.
No need to hurry
Not a worry left
But to keep alive.
Not another premium to pay
All we got to do now is play and play.
--- Unknown ---
Six years or seven
Then to heaven,
You first, the records show.
I get the pension
Not to mention
Blue Cross until I go.
If you ever thought you had fun
At twenty-one
Wait 'til we're sixty-five.
--- Unknown ---
Hop, skip to forty
Jump to fifty
Wait 'til we're sixty-five.
Paid up and grinning
Just beginning
Now to become alive.
--- DAISY ---
If the children never mature...
--- WARREN ---
What the hell,
The bonds will
So we're secure.
--- WARREN & DAISY ---
Safe from disaster,
No one has to
Take care of ma and pa.
--- WARREN ---
All brown and rosy
Living cozy
Down there in Tampa, Fla.
If you feel like Catherine the Great
At twenty-eight
Wait 'til we're sixty-five.
--- Interlude ---
--- WARREN ---
Life will be gala
Every malady all completely paid
And we've a plot a
Terra cotta
In which we'll both be laid.
If you were a little forlorn
When you were born
