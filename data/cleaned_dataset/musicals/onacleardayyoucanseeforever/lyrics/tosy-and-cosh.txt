------ Tosy and Cosh ------
--- DAISY ---
For no fantastic physique do I wait.
Such maiden pray'rs did I long ago quash.
I seek no more than a minimum mate
Who sets me feeling all tosy and cosh.
--- Unknown ---
Which merely means to be cozy and warm
And not some feminine twaddle and tosh.
No other miracle must he perform
Than keeping all of me tosy and cosh.
--- Unknown ---
His eyes may cross and collide -
My sole concern is the furnace inside.
--- Unknown ---
A stalwart, sinuous swashbuckler he,
Or one more likely to buckle than swash;
His bed more idle than bridal will be
If there's no climate that's tosy and cosh.
--- Unknown ---
'Tis sad but true
That if only you slosh
Through fields of rubbish, you only find trash.
What chance had I to be cozy and warm
With guys who only play tosy for cash.
