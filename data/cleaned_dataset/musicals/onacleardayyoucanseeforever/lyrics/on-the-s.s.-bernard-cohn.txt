------ On the S.S. Bernard Cohn ------
--- JAMES ---
You were with someone else but Warren?
--- MURIEL ---
Was he bachelor? Was he foreign?
--- JAMES ---
Just a tour or a hot amore?
Friend or a beau?
--- JAMES & MURIEL ---
Where did you go tonight?
--- DAISY ---
Come see the sights, said he.
New York in lights, said he.
Said I, It might be amusing.
Next thing I knew we were cruising
On the S. S. Bernard Cohn.
--- Unknown ---
Chilly and shivery
Out on the river, we
Found us a corner to chat in;
As we were circling Manhattan
On the S. S. Bernard Cohn.
--- Unknown ---
Dear Mr. Cohn, if by chance you exist,
Tell Mrs. Cohn you deserve to be kissed.
After tonight you're the number one Mister Cohn
I've known.
--- Unknown ---
Time went tick-tocking on
Me, I kept yakking on.
Him, he just listened and listened!
He never looked
Once at a sight
And if his kindness
Was being polite
Somehow his eyes never left me alone
Aboard the S. S. Bernard Cohn.

He said to me come see the sights
In New York in lights!

ALL;
Lights, lights, lights!
