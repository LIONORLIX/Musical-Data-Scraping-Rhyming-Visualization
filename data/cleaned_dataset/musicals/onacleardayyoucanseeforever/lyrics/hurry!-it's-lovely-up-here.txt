------ Hurry! It's Lovely Up Here ------
--- DAISY ---
Talk to flower right here?
--- DR. MARK ---
You haven't got a thing to fear.
--- DAISY ---
What if someone should see?
--- DR. MARK ---
There's no one here but you and me.
--- DAISY ---
You mean talk just as if they were in this ground.
Ok, but please turn around, turn around...

Hey buds below ... up is where to grow
Up with which below can't compare with.
Hurry - it's lovely up here...
Life down a hole takes an awful toll,
What with not a soul there to share with
Hurry - it's lovely up here!
Wake up, bestir yourself,
It's time that you disinter yourself
You've got a spot to fill - a pot to fill
And what a gift package of shower, sun and love
You'll be met above everywhere with,
Fondled and sniffed by millions who drift by,
Life here is rosy - if you're a posy
Hurry it's lovely here!

Hey, rhododend! Courage, little friend.
Ev'rything'll end rhododandy.
Hurry! It's lovely up here!
Climb up geranium, it can't be fun subterran-ium
On the exterior, it's cheerier
RSVP peonies, pollinate the breeze,
Make the queen of bees hot as brandy
Push up azalea, don't be a failure!
Come up and see the hoot we're giving!
Come up and see the grounds for living!
Come poke your head out!
Open up and spread out!
