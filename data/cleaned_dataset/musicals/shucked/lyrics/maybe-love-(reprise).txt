------ Maybe Love (Reprise) ------
--- MAIZY ---
Maybe love, it starts out young
It makes you mad, it makes you dumb
Might let pride get in the way
Then maybe love can save the day
--- BEAU ---
Maybe love
--- LULU ---
Maybe love
--- BEAU ---
Is like a farm
--- LULU ---
Is like a town
--- BEAU ---
It keeps you fed
--- LULU ---
It keeps you safe
--- BEAU ---
It keeps you sound
--- LULU ---
It keeps you sound
--- ALL THREE ---
Might get frozen in the frost
But maybe love is never lost
--- COMPANY ---
Maybe love is like a seed
--- MAIZY & BEAU ---
A little sun is all it needs
--- LULU & GORDY ---
A little rain, a little snow
--- MAIZY & BEAU ---
And it grows and grows and grows in rows from dust
Maybe
--- COMPANY ---
Love just needs
--- MAIZY & (ENSEMBLE) ---
A little faith (Ooh)
A little trust (Ooh)
Maybe love just needs
[ALL]
