------ Friends ------
--- LULU ---
It's hard to say I'm sorry
--- MAZIE ---
It's hard to say I'm wrong
--- LULU ---
When it's been so easy
For us to get along
--- MAZIE ---
For all my best intentions
I'm the one who's built a wall
--- LULU ---
Well, if we're bein' honest
I've been known to know it all
The truth is I just love you
And with everything we've lost
--- MAZIE ---
I couldn't stand to lose you
'Cause each other's all we've got
So let's not waste a moment
--- LULU ---
Stayin' mad and keepin' score
--- MAZIE ---
So could you just forgive me?
--- LULU ---
If you forgive me more
Sometimes I call you crazy
Sometimes I call you out
Sometimes I call you up at two A.M
I call you when you're happy
Or wh?n you're missin' your daddy
--- MAZIE ---
I have to call you fam'ly
But I get to call you fri?nd
--- BOTH ---
My best friend
I'll be yours until the end
--- LULU ---
Blood is thick and whiskey's thin
--- BOTH ---
When we're together
Friend, my old friend
Ins and outs and outs and ins
[MAZIE]
We've been fam'ly all our lives
--- BOTH ---
But we'll be friends
Friends forever
--- LULU, spoken ---
Folks like to say things happen for a reason
I like to say that people happen for a reason
--- MAZIE, spoken ---
Lulu, I don't ever want you to be disappointed with me
--- LULU, spoken ---
Honey, fam'ly is tellin' someone to go to hell
And then worryin' that they get there safely
--- MAZIE ---
We've all got our secrets
--- LULU ---
We wish nobody knew
--- MAZIE ---
I'm so glad that I'm the one
You've always told 'em to
[LULU]
I'd give you my happy
If it made you happy more
--- MAZIE ---
You know I'd never take it
What's mine is always yours
--- BOTH ---
I'll always call you sister
--- MAZIE ---
Sister from another mister
--- LULU ---
'Cause you've always got an ear that you can lend
--- BOTH ---
You're my most prized possession
--- MAZIE ---
Since mama went to Heaven
--- LULU ---
I have to call you fam'ly
But I get to call you friend
--- BOTH ---
My best friend
Take your heart around the bend
Always just remember when
When we're together
Friend, my old friend
Ins and outs and outs and ins
We've been fam'ly all our lives
But we'll be friends
Friends forever
--- Unknown ---
We've been fam'ly all our lives
But we'll be friends
