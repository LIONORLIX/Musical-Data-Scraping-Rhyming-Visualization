------ Best Man Wins ------
--- PEANUT ---
He ain't from where we come from
We may talk slow, but we ain't dumb
He thinks we're all just country hicks
You double-dare these derelicts
Yee-haw!
--- TENORS & BASSES ---
Even a wolf in sheep's disguise
Won't pull the wool over our eyes
He's a dry martini sipper
But we hold our women like we hold our liquor
He may have fixed the corn
But he ain't foolin' us
It's time to pay the fiddler, hey
Enough is enough
--- Unknown ---
Yee-haw, hee-haw
There's two roosters
Just one hen
Yee-haw, hee-haw
--- PEANUT ---
It's a fight to the finish, may the best man win
--- TENORS & BASSES ---
Yee-haw, hee-haw
There's two pigs
Just one pen
Yee-haw, hee-haw
It's a fight to the finish, may the best man win
--- BEAU, spoken ---
Yeah, but y'all seen 'im
--- Unknown ---
(singing)
He's got style and he's got slick
--- PEANUT ---
But you've got heart and you've got grit
--- BEAU ---
Well, he's got secrets, mystery
--- PEANUT ---
But you've got all this history
You ain't gonna let 'er go
No, not without a fight
--- TENORS & BASSES ---
You gotta fight!
--- PEANUT ---
It's time to let the moon shine
--- TENORS & BASSES ---
Shed a little light
Yee-haw, hee-haw
[PEANUT]
There's two lions
--- BEAU ---
Just one den
--- TENORS & BASSES ---
Yee-haw, hee-haw
There's two roosters
--- BEAU ---
Just one hen
--- TENORS & BASSES ---
Yee-haw, hee-haw
--- PEANUT ---
There's two bottles
--- BEAU ---
Just one spin
--- TENORS & BASSES ---
Yee-haw, hee-haw
It's a fight to the finish, may the best man win
Instrumental break
--- Unknown ---
Milk that cow!
Milk that cow!
Milk that cow!
Milk that cow! Pork that pig!
Goose the goose! Pony pony!
Aah!
--- Unknown ---
Ain't gonna let 'er go, ain't gonna let 'er go
Ain't gonna let 'er go without a fight
Ain't gonna let 'im take, ain't gonna let 'im take
Ain't gonna let 'im take the girl tonight
Ain't gonna let 'im break, ain't gonna let 'im break
Ain't gonna let 'im break the ties that bind
It's time to let the moon, it's time to let the moon shine!
--- Unknown ---
Yee-haw, hee-haw
There's two triggers
--- BEAU ---
Just one gun
--- TENORS & BASSES ---
Yee-haw, hee-haw
There's two hot dogs
--- BEAU ---
Just one bun
--- TENORS & BASSES ---
Yee-haw, hee-haw
There's two whiskeys
--- BEAU ---
Just one glass
--- TENORS & BASSES ---
Yee-haw, hee-haw
There's two horses
--- BEAU ---
And just one ass!
--- COMPANY ---
Hee-haw, oh
Hee-haw
