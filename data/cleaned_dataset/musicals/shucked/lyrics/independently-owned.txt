------ Independently Owned ------
--- Verse 1 ---
I'm independently owned and operated
The only thing around here that's incorporated
I do it all and that's fine by me
I'm a one woman whiskey dynasty
--- Verse 2 ---
I'm independently owned and liberated
And I think sleeping alone is underrated
Don't need a man for flatteries
Got a corn cob and some batteries
--- Refrain ---
And I'll never say I do if I really don't
If settling means settling down, then I won't
Being a wife just ain't the life for me
--- Verse 3 ---
I'm independ?ntly owned and complicated
And, no, I don't need a man to feel emancipat?d
The boys 'round here sure ain't much help
This corn ain't gonna shuck itself
--- Refrain ---
There might be someone that I ain't met yet
And no disrespect to Miss Tammy Wynette
I can't stand by my man, he'll have to stand by me, oh
--- Bridge ---
I'm independently owned and modulated
And every man that I meet is just intimidated
I won't change who I've always been
A W-O-M-A-N
W-O-M-A-N
--- Outro ---
I'm independently owned and celebrating
I'm independently owned and educating
I don't depend on anybody but me
And I live my life
Independently
So independently
Independent
Operating, modulating, celebrating
Liberated, calculated, educated
Underrated, motivated, advocated, intimidating
