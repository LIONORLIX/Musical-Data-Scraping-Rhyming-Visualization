------ Walls ------
--- MAIZY ---
We're stubborn and we're prideful
Don't need nobody else
We'd rather get our tooth pulled
Than ever ask for help
And that's always served us well
Until right now
But our way of life is dyin'
And we haven't got a prayer
The truth is I'd be lyin'
If I said I wasn't scared
To go and let the outside in
Even if it turns us inside out
--- Unknown ---
We build walls
Around our homes, around our hearts
Build 'em tall
So what's inside won't fall apart
But if we just stay here in limbo
We could lose it all
So I'm lookin' for a window, not a wall
--- Unknown ---
We only see the danger
In plac?s we ain't been
We nev?r think a stranger
Could ever be a friend
But every friend you've got
Is someone that you didn't used to know
--- MAIZY & (ENSEMBLE) ---
So why build walls (Oh)
Around our homes, around our hearts?
We just stay small (Small)
Always thinkin' we're so smart
But that story's gotta end though
Or we could lose it all
So I'm lookin' for a window, not a wall
--- Unknown ---
A window lets the sunshine in
The summer wind
Maybe even a new friend
And with a little hope and a little help
Maybe we just might
Save ourselves after all
If we could find a window, not a wall
