--- BEAU ---
Why don't you pretend I'm him?
--- LULU ---
Why don't you pretend I'm her?
Forget that I'm her oldest friend
--- BEAU ---
Forget about the way we were
--- LULU ---
If it were me, I'd like to hear
You'd hold me for a hundred years
--- BEAU ---
If it were me, I'd like to know
You'd never ever let me go
--- BOTH ---
I can, I will
I'll love you until
--- LULU ---
The world stops turnin'

The sun stops burnin'
--- BOTH ---
Just promise to be honest and true
--- LULU ---
That's how you say
--- BOTH ---
That's how you say I do
--- GORDY ---
Maybe I should take her hand
--- STORYTELLER 1 ---
That sounds lik? a decent plan
--- MAZIE ---
Maybe w? should get real close
--- STOTRYTELLER 2 ---
I can feel it in my toes
--- GORDY ---
Maybe I should kiss her and
--- STORYTELLER 1 ---
I think I'm gonna need a fan
[MAZIE]
See if somethin' starts to grow
--- STOTRYTELLER 2 ---
Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho

Forsaking all others

Including yourself

For better or worse
'Til we're in a hearse
