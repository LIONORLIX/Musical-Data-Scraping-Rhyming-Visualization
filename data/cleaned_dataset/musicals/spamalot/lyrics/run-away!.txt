------ Run Away! ------
--- Unknown ---
Bravely Robin ran away, (No!)
Bravely ran away, away. (I didn't!)
--- Unknown ---
When danger reared its ugly head,
he bravely turned his tail and fled. (No!)
Yes, brave Sir Robin turned about (I didn't)
And gallantly, he chickened out.
--- Unknown ---
Bravely taking to his feet, (I never did!)
He beat a very brave retreat, (Oh, lie!)
