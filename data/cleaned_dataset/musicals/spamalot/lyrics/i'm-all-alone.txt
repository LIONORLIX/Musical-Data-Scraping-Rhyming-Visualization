------ I'm All Alone ------
--- King Arthur ---
I'm all alone
all by myself
there is no one here beside me
im all alone
quite, all alone
no one to comfort me or guide me
why is there no one here with me
on the long and winding road
to lift my heavy load
if there were someone here with me
how happy i would be
but im alone
quite all alone
all by myself im all alone
--- Unknown ---
I'm all alone
All by myself
I cannot face tomorrow
I'm all alone
So all alone
No one to share my sorrow
--- Patsy ---
You know it seems quite clear to me
because im working class
i am just the horses ass
he sells me down the river
so what am i, chopped liver?
--- Arthur ---
But i'm alone
So all alone
All by myself im all alone
--- Unknown ---
Knitghts: he's all alone
Arthur: i'm all alone
Knights: all by himself
Arthur: all by myself
Knights: there is no one here beside him, He's all alone
Arthur: so all alone
Knights: apart from us,
No one to comfort him or guide him
--- Unknown ---
Arthur: each one of us is all alone
so what are we to do
in order to get through
we must be lonely side by side
it's a perfect way to hide
--- Unknown ---
Knights: we're all alone
Arthur: we're all alone
Knights: yes all alone
Arthur: so all alone,
each by ourselves
we're all alone.
