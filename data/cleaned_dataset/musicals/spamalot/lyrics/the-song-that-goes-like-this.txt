------ The Song that Goes Like This ------
--- Unknown ---
Once in every show
There comes a song like this
It starts off soft and low
And ends up with a kiss
Oh where is the song that goes like this
Where is it?
Where?
Where?
--- Unknown ---
A sentimental song
If it casts a magic spell
They only hum along
We'll over-act like Hell
Oh, this is the song that goes like this
--- Unknown ---
Yes it is
Yes it is
Yes it is
Yes it is
--- Unknown ---
Now we can go straight into the middle eight
A bridge that is too far for me
I'll sing it in your face
While we both embrace
And then we change the key
--- Unknown ---
Now we're into E
Hm, that's awfully high for me
But everyone can see
We should have stayed in D
For this is our song that goes like this
--- Unknown ---
I'm feeling very proud
You're singing far too loud
That's the way that this song goes
You're standing on my toes
Singing our song that goes like this
--- Unknown ---
I can't believe there's more
It's far too long im sure
That's the trouble with this song
It goes on and on and on
For this is our song that is too long
--- Unknown ---
Jesus Christ God Damnit!
--- Unknown ---
When we've taken this too long
You'll wish that you weren't born
Let's stop this damn refrain
Before we go insane
--- Unknown ---
The song always ends like this
