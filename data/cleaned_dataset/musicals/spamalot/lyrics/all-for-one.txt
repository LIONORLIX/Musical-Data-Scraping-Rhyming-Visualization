------ All For One ------
--- HISTORIAN ---
And so, King Arthur gathered his Knights together,
bringing from all the corners of the Kingdom the strongest and bravest in
the land to sit at the Round Table.
The strangely flatulent Sir Bedevere,
the dasingly handsome Sir Galahad, the homicidally brave Sir Lancelot,
Sir Robin the Not-quite-so-brave-as-Sir-Lancelot,
who slew the vicious Chicken of Bristol and who
personally wet himself at the Battle of Badon Hill.
And the aptly named Sir Not-appearing-in-this-show.
--- SIR NOT ---
Sorry.
--- HISTORIAN ---
Together they formed a band whose names
and deeds were to be retold throughout the Centuries...
The Knights of the Round Table.
--- ALL ---
All for one
One for all
All for one
And one for all
--- BEDEVERE ---
Some for some
--- GALAHAD ---
None for none
--- ROBIN ---
Slightly less for people we don't like
--- LANCELOT ---
And a little bit more for me
--- ALL ---
All round this Blightly land
We are his mighty band
Oooo
King Arthur's strongest knights
We are prepared to fight
Whoooo-ever
All for one
Two for all
All for some
And free for all
