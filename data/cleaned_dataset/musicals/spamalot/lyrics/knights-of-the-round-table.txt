------ Knights of the Round Table ------
--- GIRLS ---
Camelot
The town that never sleeps
It's Camelot!
--- ALL KNIGHTS ---
We're knights of the round table
We dance when e're we're able
We do routines and chorus scenes
With footwork impecc-able
We dine well here in Camelot
We eat ham and jam and spam alot
--- Unknown ---
We're knights of the round talbe
Our shows are for-mid-able
But many times, we're given rythmes
That are quite unsing-able
We're opera mad in Camelot
We sing from the diaphragm a lot

We're not just bums
With royal mums
We've brains that are quite a-ble
We've a busy life in Camelot.

Ladies and gentlemen - The Lady of the Lake.
--- LADY OF THE LAKE ---
Once in every show
There comes a song like.......this
It starts off soft and low
And ends up with a kiss
Oh, where is the song that goes like this?
Goes like this?
A sentimental song
That cast a magic spell
They will all hum along
And we'll all overact, overact like hell
'Cos this is the song
Yes this is the song
Oh this is the song that goes.......like
