------ Monks' Chant/ He Is Not Dead Yet ------
--- MONKS ---
Sacrosanctus Domine
Pecavi ignoviunt
Iuesus Christus Domine
Pax vobiscum venerunt
--- ROBIN ---
Bring out your dead! Bring out your dead!
--- LANCE ---
Here's one.
--- DAD ---
I'm not dead!
--- ROBIN ---
Here, he says he's not dead!
--- LANCE ---
Yes, he is.
--- DAD ---
I feel happy. I feel happy.
--- DAD ---
I am not dead yet
I can dance and I can sing
I am not dead yet
I can do the highland fling
I am not dead yet
No need to go to bed
No need to call the doctor
'Cos I'm not yet dead
--- MINSTRELS ---
He is not yet dead
That's what the geezer said
Oh, he's not yet dead
That man is off his head
He is not yet dead
Put him back in bed
Keep him off the cart because he's not yet dead
--- MINSTRELS ---
Well now he's dad
You whacked him on the head
Sure now he's dead
It makes me just see red
You are such a brute
To murder that old coot
You homicidal bastard, now he's really dead
Who is the knave who put him in his grave
And who needs to manage his anger?
--- LANCE ---
My name is Lancelot
I'm big and strong and hot
Occasionally I do
Some things that I should not
--- ROBIN ---
I want to be a knight
But I don't like to fight
I'm rather scared I may
Just simply run away
--- LANCE ---
I'll be right with you
Robin through and through and through
So stick with me and I'll show you what to do
--- ROBIN ---
We'll remain good chums
You can teach me how to dance
--- BOTH ---
We're going to enlist
--- ROBIN ---
I'm Robin
--- LANCE ---
And I'm Lance
--- CHORUS ---
Oh we're off to war
Because we're not yet dead
We will all enlist
As the Knights that Arthur led
--- DAD ---
I am coming too
My name will be Sir Fred
I'll be your musician
Cos I'm not yet dead
--- CHORUS ---
Oh we're not dead yet
To Camelot we go
To enlist instead
To try and earn some dough
And so although
We should have stayed in bed
We're going off to war
Because we're not yet dead
--- LANCE ---
To kill
I will
It gives me such a thrill
--- ROBIN ---
To sing
And dance
And keep an eye on Lance
--- ALL ---
We're going off to war
We'll have girlfriends by the score
--- DAD ---
We'll be shot by Michael Moore
--- ALL ---
Because we're not yet dead
