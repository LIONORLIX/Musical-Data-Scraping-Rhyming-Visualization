------ I Won't Grow Up ------
--- PETER PAN ---
Are you ready for today's lesson?
--- ALL ---
Yes, Peter!
--- PETER PAN ---
Listen to your teacher. Repeat after me:
I won't grow up,
I don't want to go to school.
Just to learn to be a parrot,
And recite a silly rule.
If growing up means
It would be beneath my dignity to climb a tree,
I'll never grow up, never grow up, never grow up
Not me!
Not I,
Not me!
Not me!
I won't grow up,
I don't want to wear a tie.
And a serious expression
In the middle of July.
And if it means I must prepare
To shoulder burdens with a worried air,
--- Unknown ---
I'll never grow up, never grow up, never grow up
Not me,
Not I,
Not me!
So there!
Never gonna be a man,
I won't!
Like to see somebody try
And make me.
Anyone who wants to try
And make me turn into a man,
Catch me if you can.
I won't grow up.
Not a penny will I pinch.
I will never grow a mustache,
Or a fraction of an inch.
'Cause growing up is awfuller
Than all the awful things that ever were.
I'll never grow up, never grow up, never grow up,
No sir,
Not I,
Not me,
So there!
--- Unknown ---
I won't grow up!
I will never even try
I will do what Peter tells me
And I'll never ask him why
--- Unknown ---
We won't grow up!
We will never grow a day
And if someone tries to make it
We will simply run away
--- Unknown ---
I won't grow up!
No, I promise that I won't
I will stay a boy forever
And be banished if I don't!
--- Unknown ---
And Never Land will always be
The home of youth and joy and liberty
I'll never grow up, never grow up, never grow up
Not me!
Not me!
Not me!
Not me!
No sir!
Not me!
