------ I Gotta Crow (Reprise) ------
--- Unknown ---
I've gotta crow!
I'm just the cleverest fellow
'Twas ever my fortune to know;
I give the sign and the sunlight will shine
And the forest will grow
And the rivers will flow
I've gotta crow!
--- Unknown ---
-Oh Peter, you are the most wonderful boy in the world!
Is there anything that you couldn't do?
--- Unknown ---
-Nothing!
--- Unknown ---
-Peter, will you teach me how to crow?
--- Unknown ---
-Sure!
--- Unknown ---
You'll do it too
--- Unknown ---
-Me!?
--- Unknown ---
-Yes!
And if you choose
You will find such unusual things you can do
--- Unknown ---
-Ugh-u-u-uh...
--- Unknown ---
-You're getting warm but
Your mouth should be forming a happier
--- Unknown ---
-Ugh-ur-r-r!
--- Unknown ---
-Don't be such a sissy, prim and prissy
Let out the crow!
You've nothing to fear
Come and whisper it close to my ear...
--- Unknown ---
-ugh ugh ugh
Ugh ugh ugh
UGH UGH UGH!
-That's better
--- Unknown ---
And now we can crow
Ugh ugh ugh
Just like a rooster we'll be
Our own booster and let out the crow
Ugh ugh ugh
We'll give the proudest and gayest
And loudest crow that we know
Everybody let go
Ugh ugh ugh
And crow
Ugh ugh ugh
Ugh ugh ugh
Ugh ugh ugh

Tender shepherd
Tender shepherd
Let me help you hold your sheep
One in the meadow
Two in the garden
Three in the nursery
Fast asleep...
--- Unknown ---
Will you treat me with respect?
Let me have a little peace and quiet?
--- Unknown ---
(We will always try to be so quiet
Quieter than mice!)
--- Unknown ---
Oh wouldn't that be nice!
--- Unknown ---
We will grow up
We will mind the P's and Q's
We will never be a bother
(They will never be a bother
And we'll always shine your shoes)
Oh do think of all those shoes!
???
We trying to grow up
Trying to grow up,
Trying to grow up
Like me,
Like I,
Like me.

Peter Pan, will you teach me how to fly!
--- PETER PAN ---
Oh Jane, Jane...
First I must blow the fairy dust on you!
Ah!
--- Unknown ---
Now come with me where dreams are born,
And time is never planned.
Just think of lovely things.
And your heart will fly on wings,
