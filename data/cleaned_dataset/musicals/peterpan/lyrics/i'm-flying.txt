------ I'm Flying ------
--- PETER and CHILDREN ---
I'm flying
Look at me way up high,
Suddenly here am I
I'm flying.
--- Unknown ---
I'm flying
I can soar
I can weave and what's more
I'm not even trying
--- Unknown ---
High up, and as light as I can be.
I must be a sight lovely to see.
--- Unknown ---
I'm flying.
Nothing will stop me now:
Higher still look at how
I can zoom around,
'Way up off the ground
I'm flying.
--- Unknown ---
I fly and I'm all over the place
You try and you fall flat on your face
--- Unknown ---
I'm flying.
Over bed, over chair
Duck your head, clear the air
Oh, what lovely fun
Watch me everyone
Take a look at me
A see how easily it's done
I'm flying!
--- CHILDREN ---
Oh, teach us Peter, please, teach us!
--- PETER PAN ---
First I must blow the fairy dust on you!
Shhh...
Shhh...
Shhh...
Now think lovely thoughts
--- ALL ---
Think lovely thoughts
Think lovely thoughts
Fishing
Hoopskirt
Candy!
--- Unknown ---
Picnics
Summer
Candy!
--- Unknown ---
Sailing
Flowers
Candy!
--- Unknown ---
Lovelier thoughts, Michael!
--- Unknown ---
Christmas?!
--- PETER PAN ---
Ah, ah, flying!
Like an owl, like a bat,
Or the crow,
It's so satisfying!
--- Unknown ---
I'm whizzing
Through a cloud
Past the star
I'm so proud
Look how far I breeze in
High over the moon
Higher I fly
By old mister moon
Wave me goodbye
--- Unknown ---
I'm flying.
Heading far out of sight
Second star to the right
Now the way is clear
Never Land is near
Follow all the air
Cause I'm about to disappear
I'm flying!
