------ Hook's Tango ------
--- Unknown ---
To cook a cake quite large
And fill each layer in between
With icing mixed with poison
Til it turns a tempting green
--- Unknown ---
(icing mixed with poison
Til it turns a tempting green)
--- Unknown ---
We'll place it near the house
Just where the boys are sure to come
And being greedy they won't care to
Question such a plum
--- Unknown ---
(the boys who have no mother sweet)
No one to show them their mistake
So damp and rich a cake-
--- Unknown ---
And so before the winking of an eye
Those boys will eat that poison cake
And one by one they'll die-
--- Unknown ---
(they'll die they'll die they'll die they'll die they'll die-!
Ole!
