------ Get up and Go ------
--- Unknown ---
If you get up and walk away
Leave the past behind
Go ahead and take a ride
No telling what you'll find
--- Unknown ---
The words you say don't mean a thing
They fly right by my eyes
Lookin the mirror don't look at me
Maybe then you'll realize
--- Unknown ---
(Chorus:)
So get up and go
If you're so tired of moving slow
--- Unknown ---
I was on the inside
Looking out for you
But you're the one to make the change
There's nothing I can do
--- Unknown ---
Now's the time for you to move
Actions shout out loud
So cut the talk and move your feet
Cuz words get lost in crowds
--- Unknown ---
(Chorus)
--- Unknown ---
Quit talking
Start walking now
