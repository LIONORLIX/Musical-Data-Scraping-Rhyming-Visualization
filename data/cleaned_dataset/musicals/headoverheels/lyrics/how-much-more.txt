------ How Much More ------
--- Unknown ---
Every night I see you walk
Walking by, walking by
You hold your head so close to hers
I could cry, yeah, I could cry
I want to be that girl tonite
Girl tonite, girl tonite
--- Unknown ---
(Chorus:)
How much more can I take
Before I go crazy, oh yeah
How much more heartache
Before I go crazy, oh yeah
--- Unknown ---
Love's in your eyes
Making me cry
Why isn't it me?
She's looking good
Just like I would
If it could be me
--- Unknown ---
(Chorus)
