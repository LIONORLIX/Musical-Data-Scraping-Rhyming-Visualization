------ Vacation ------
--- Unknown ---
Can't seem to get my mind off of you
Back here at home there's nothin' to do
Now that I'm away
I wish I'd stayed
Tomorrow's a day of mine
That you won't be in
--- Unknown ---
When you looked at me
I should've run
But I thought it was just for fun
I see I was wrong
And I'm not so strong
I should've known all along
That time would tell
--- Unknown ---
A week without you
Thought I'd forget
Two weeks without you and I
Still haven't gotten over you yet
--- Unknown ---
Vacation
All I ever wanted
Vacation
Had to get away
Vacation
Meant to be spent alone
--- Unknown ---
