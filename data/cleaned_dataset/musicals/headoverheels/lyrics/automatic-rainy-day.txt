------ Automatic Rainy Day ------
--- Unknown ---
You walk into the room and the temperature falls
The mood disappears
Chased away by the gathering storm
That is here
--- Unknown ---
I look up painted sky full of memories
And this house has no roof to shelter me
--- Unknown ---
It's an automatic rainy day
When I see you
It's the perfect consolation prize
A little piece of blue
It's an automatic rainy day
--- Unknown ---
Just when it feels like the world
Is together and whole
You come around
Dragging your permanent cloud
And the weather turns cold
--- Unknown ---
Hang around for a repeat of history
Falling down in the hole you dug for free
--- Unknown ---
It's an automatic rainy day
When I see you
It's the perfect consolation prize
A little piece of blue
It's an automatic rainy day
--- Unknown ---
When you see the reaction you cause
Does it make you sad?
Do you even realize
That you're such a drag?
