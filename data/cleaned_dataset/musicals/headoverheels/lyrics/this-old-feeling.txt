------ This Old Feeling ------
--- Unknown ---
This old feeling
It's new to me
I'm not sure
How I should be
I'd tattoo my vow
For all to see
To prove how much
You mean to me
--- Unknown ---
A million times said
In as many songs
But before you
I could never sing along
I love you
I do
I love you
I do
--- Unknown ---
This old feeling
It's got me up
I can't believe
My good luck
I'd wait at your door
Till eternity
Because you mean
