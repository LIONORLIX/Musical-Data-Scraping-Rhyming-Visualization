------ Heaven Is a Place on Earth ------
--- Unknown ---
Ooh, baby, do you know what that's worth?
Ooh heaven is a place on earth
They say in heaven love comes first
We'll make heaven a place on earth
Ooh heaven is a place on earth

When the night falls down
I wait for you
And you come around
And the world's alive
With the sound of kids
On the street outside
--- Unknown ---
When you walk into the room
You pull me close and we start to move
And we're spinning with the stars above
And you lift me up in a wave of love...
--- Unknown ---
Ooh, baby, do you know what that's worth?
Ooh heaven is a place on earth
They say in heaven love comes first
We'll make heaven a place on earth
Ooh heaven is a place on earth
--- Unknown ---
When I feel alone
I reach for you
And you bring me home
When I'm lost at sea
I hear your voice
And it carries me
--- Unknown ---
In this world we're just beginning
To understand the miracle of living
Baby I was afraid before
But I'm not afraid anymore
--- Unknown ---
Ooh, baby, do you know what that's worth?
Ooh heaven is a place on earth
They say in heaven love comes first
We'll make heaven a place on earth
Ooh heaven is a place on earth
--- Unknown ---
In this world we're just beginning

Baby I was afraid before
But I'm not afraid anymore

Ooh, baby, do you know what that's worth?
Ooh heaven is a place on earth

We'll make heaven a place on earth
Ooh heaven is a place on earth
