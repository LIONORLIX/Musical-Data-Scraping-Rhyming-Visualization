------ Our Lips Are Sealed ------
--- Unknown ---
Can you hear them
They talk about us
Telling lies
Well, that's no surprise
--- Unknown ---
Can you see them
See right through them
They have no shield
No secrets to reveal
--- Unknown ---
It doesn't matter what they say
In the jealous games people play
Our lips are sealed
--- Unknown ---
There's a weapon
That we must use
In our defense
Silence reveals
--- Unknown ---
When you look at them
Look right through them
That's when they'll disappear
That's when we'll be feared
--- Unknown ---
It doesn't matter what they say
In the jealous games people play
Our lips are sealed
--- Unknown ---
Give no mind to what they say
It doesn't matter anyway
Our lips are sealed
--- Unknown ---
Hush, my darling
Don't you cry
Quiet, angel
Forget their lies
--- Unknown ---
Can you hear them
They talk about us
Telling lies
Well, that's no surprise
--- Unknown ---
Can you see them
See right through them
They have no shield
No secrets to reveal
--- Unknown ---
It doesn't matter what they say
In the jealous games people play
Our lips are sealed
--- Unknown ---
Pay no mind to what they say
It doesn't matter anyway
Our lips are sealed
Our lips are sealed
Our lips are sealed
