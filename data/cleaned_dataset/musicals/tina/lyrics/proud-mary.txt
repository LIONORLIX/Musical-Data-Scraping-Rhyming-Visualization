------ Proud Mary ------
--- Unknown ---
You know
Every now and then I think you might like to hear something from us nice, easy
There's just one thing
You see we never ever do nothing nice, easy
We always do it nice and rough
--- Unknown ---
And we're gonna take the beginning of this song and do it easy
But then we're gonna do the finish rough
That's the way we do
Proud Mary
--- Unknown ---
Left a good job down in the city
Workin' for the Man every night and day
But I never lost one minute of sleepin'
I was worryin' 'bout the way things might have been
--- Unknown ---
Big wheel keep on turnin'
Proud Mary keep on burnin'
And we're rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river
--- Unknown ---
Listen to the story
--- Unknown ---
Left a good job down in the city
Workin' for the Man every night and day
And I never lost one minute of sleepin'
And I was worryin' 'bout the way that things might have been
--- Unknown ---
You know that big wheel keep on turnin'
Proud Mary keep on burnin'
And we're rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river
--- Unknown ---
Cleaned a lot of plates in Memphis
You know I pumped a lot of 'tane down in New Orleans
But I never saw the good side of the city
Until I hitched a ride on the river boat queen
--- Unknown ---
You know that big wheel keep on turnin'
Proud Mary keep on burnin'
And we're rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river
We're rolling on the river
--- Unknown ---
Say we're rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river,
We're rolling on the river
--- Unknown ---
I left a good job in the city
Workin' for the Man every night and day
And I never lost a minute of sleepin'
Worryin' 'bout the way things might have been

Big wheel keep on turnin'

Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river
Say we're rollin', we're rollin',

Alright
--- Unknown ---
Oh, I cleaned a lot of plates in Memphis
And I pumped a lot of 'tane down in New Orleans
But I never saw the good side of a city
'Til I hitched a ride on the riverboat queen
--- Unknown ---
Big wheel keep on turnin'
Proud Mary keep on burnin'
And we're rollin', so we're rollin',
We're rollin' on the river
I tell you we're rollin', rollin',
We're rollin' on the river
--- Unknown ---
Alright

If you come down to the river
I bet you're gonna find some people who live
And you don't have to worry if you got no money
People on the river are happy to give
--- Unknown ---
Big wheel keep on turnin'
Proud Mary keep on burnin'
And we're rollin', and we're rollin',
And we're rollin' on the river
Tell me one more time
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river
