------ Disco Inferno ------
--- Unknown ---
Burn baby burn, burn baby burn
Burn baby burn, burn baby burn
Burn it
To my surprise, one hundred storys high
People gettin' loose now
Gettin' down on the roof
I tell you, folks screamin'
Out of control
It was so entertainin'
When the boogie started to explode
I heard somebody say
Disco inferno
Burn that mother down now
Disco inferno
Burn that mother down
Satisfaction came in a chain reaction
I tell you, I couldn't get enough
So I had to self-destruct
I tell you, the heat was on
Risin' to the top
Everybody is goin' strong
And that is when my spark got hot
I heard somebody say
Disco inferno
Burn that mother down now
Disco inferno
Burn that mother down
Up above my head
I hear music in the air, I hear music
That makes me know
There's a party somewhere
Satisfaction came in a chain reaction
I couldn't get enough
So I had to self-destruct
I tell you, heat was on
Risin' to the top
Everybody is goin' strong
That is when my spark got hot
I heard somebody say
Disco inferno
Burn that mother down now
Disco inferno
Say burn that mother down
Disco inferno
Burn that mother down now
Disco inferno
Burn that mother down
I just can't stop
Oh when my spark gets hot
Just can't stop
Just can't stop
Once my spark's got hot
