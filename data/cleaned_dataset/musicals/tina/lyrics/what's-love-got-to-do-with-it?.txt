------ What's Love Got to Do With It? ------
--- Unknown ---
You must understand
Though the touch of your hand
Makes my pulse react
That it's only the thrill
Of boy meeting girl
Opposites attract
--- Unknown ---
It's physical
Only logical
You must try to ignore
That it means more than that
--- Chorus: ---
Oh what's love got to do, got to do with it
What's love but a second hand emotion
What's love got to do, got to do with it
Who needs a heart
When a heart can be broken
--- Unknown ---
It may seem to you
That I'm acting confused
When you're close to me
If I tend to look dazed
I've read it someplace
I've got cause to be
--- Unknown ---
There's a name for it
There's a phrase that fits
But whatever the reason
You do it for me
--- Chorus ---
--- Unknown ---
I've been taking on a new direction
But I have to say
I've been thinking about my own protection
It scares me to feel this way
--- Chorus ---
--- Unknown ---
What's love got to do, got to do with it
What's love but a sweet old fashioned notion
What's love got to do, got to do with it
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken
