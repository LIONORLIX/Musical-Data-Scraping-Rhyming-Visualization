--- ELIZABETH ARDEN (speaking) ---
Is that all I'm worth to them? A color?
--- Unknown ---
(singing)
Pink
Is that my only claim to fame?
Pink
My shot at permanent acclaim
Pink
My legend branded with a rose
Immortalized in Posy Pink
--- Unknown ---
On Mamie Eisenhower's Lips
Pink
On Mrs. Astor's roots and tips
Pink
The boxes packaged with a bow
That cost more than the lotion
--- Unknown ---
Pink
That flush of ardor in a man's embrace
My would be baby with a rosy face
And rabbits from the test
Who perished for a nursery converted to a guest room
Dressed in Pink
--- Unknown ---
With an enormous princess bed
Pink
The cherubs painted overhead in Pink
Coral Pink
Just Pink.

When I was just a farm girl in Ontario
Could anyone have known how far I'd climb?
A multi-millionairess not so long ago
The derby winning cover-girl of Time
--- Unknown ---
A confident to presidents and royalty
Her generation's connoisseur of style
In years to come I wonder how they'll picture me
A legend, or some aging erstwhile juvenile in Pink
--- Unknown ---
Still the eternal debutante
Pink
The only shred of me they want
Pink
My one accomplishment to last
When I'm put out to pasture
--- Unknown ---
Pink
Pink
Oh is pink
My shoes my furniture my clothes
My life, la vie en rose, oh
Pink
The glint of sunrise on a frozen pond
The glow of twilight through the dark beyond
The pink rinse of my coif
Reclining on the matching satin lining of my coffin
Swathed in Pink
--- Unknown ---
My life's work withered on the vine
Pink
All for a document to sign
In Pink ink.
--- Unknown ---
Fuchsia pink.
--- Unknown ---
Persian pink.
--- Unknown ---
Peachy pink.
--- Unknown ---
Mocha pink, timeless pink, story pink, fabled pink, glory pink, label pink.
--- Unknown ---
Arden Pink.
