------ Better Yourself ------

You have the power to reinvent yourself and become anything you'd like to be.
The first step? Your appearance.
--- Unknown ---
(singing)
--- Unknown ---
Look at your face
See your mistake
Not an enticing effect to be icing your face like a cake
--- Unknown ---
Liable to smudge the collar of a man
Young lady
Better yourself to be the best that you can
--- Unknown ---
Look at your dress
Quite a design
Waving your asset in public is tacit to wearing a sign:
'Open for business, taking checks or cash'
But once you better yourself
You won't be taken for trash
--- Unknown ---
You can look as la-dee-da
As any heiress with a rich papa
You just convey that certain
Je ne sais quoi

(speaking)

Now if you'll excuse me, I've mountains to climb!
--- Unknown ---
(singing)
--- Unknown ---
Poor little kid
Wanting in charm
You know the kind as demure and refined as a fire alarm
Somehow she makes me cry beneath my smile
--- Unknown ---
Of course I've met her myself
That young go-getter; myself
And maybe better myself
Before I bettered myself
