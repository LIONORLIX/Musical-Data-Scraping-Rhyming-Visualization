Now you know
Fine lady
Now I hope you know
How it feels to find yourself outside
--- Unknown ---
I too am called a nouveau riche pretender
The Jew's application gets 'Return to Sender'
--- Unknown ---
Live and learn
Dear lady
Now enjoy your turn
Barred from places I have been denied
For now you know how far
From one of them you are
And now I know how much it wounds your pride
--- Unknown ---
You may fairer than me
A good deal blonder than me
But socially they value you no fonder than me
--- Unknown ---
You think you've made the grade
You think you've earned the win
But when you try to join the club
Guess who's not getting in
Not getting in
--- Unknown ---
Right?
--- Unknown ---
Not that this brings us closer than it ever did
Not that I feel some kinship that I never did
--- Unknown ---
Now you see
Great lady
How it's been for me
Some circles are restricted to you too
--- Unknown ---
A woman scales the wall
Climbs high above them all
And oh what gates of hell they put her through
--- Unknown ---
So now we know
God help us all, we know
The way that life can twist the knife
