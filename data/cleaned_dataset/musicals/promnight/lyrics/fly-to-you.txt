------ Fly To You ------
--- Starr ---
I put so much
Into this little dream I had
--- Unknown ---
I'd swear you
I could almost taste and touch
Peace at last
--- Unknown ---
But if you taught me anything
It was how to let things I love so go
--- Unknown ---
You said through all this whatever becomes of me
I'll fly to you
With love, and no regrets
Whatever becomes of me I fly to you
In this world of subtlety and envy
there was a time for you and me
--- Unknown ---
Like summer song
Like theres nothing wrong
I fly to you
--- Cole ---
My remembrance of you
Seems so real
I could live in it
--- Unknown ---
But it seems so long
Since I came to you
Searchin for a friend
--- Unknown ---
But when your voice spoke to me
--- Unknown ---
Cole & Starr: Its whisper was some how different
--- Unknown ---
Now you say through all this
Whatever becomes of me I fly to you
With Love, and no regrets
Whatever becomes of me I fly to you
--- Unknown ---
In this world of subtlety and envy
there was a time for you and me
Like a summersong
Like theres nothing wrong
