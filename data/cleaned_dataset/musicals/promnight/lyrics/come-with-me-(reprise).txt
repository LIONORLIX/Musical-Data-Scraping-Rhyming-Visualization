------ Come With Me (Reprise) ------
--- Unknown ---
You might just be the boy I've always known
I might be lost in something beautiful
We might have found a secret deep inside ourselves
Deeper than this moment here tonight
--- Unknown ---
In a song
we become one
you and I
right from the boundaries of time
Come with me where the melody is alive
and wakeing our hearts to
is alive and wakeing our hearts to
