------ Violet Delight ------
--- Unknown ---
Don?t act like that
Don?t shut me out
Like I?m a stranger and she?s not
You?re all I dream Violet Delight
You wake me in the night
--- Unknown ---
It?s rare that I should care this much
It scares me how I need your touch
Now I understand that
You can live with all I am
--- Unknown ---
Don?t wake me up
All we?ve been through
Imperfect girl whose right for you
I want it all I want the pain
When you are gone it rains
--- Unknown ---
It?s rare that I should care this much
It scares me how I need your touch
Now I understand that
You can live with all I am
--- Unknown ---
My heart is breaking
I?m deaf in sound sleep
--- Unknown ---
It?s rare that I should care this much
It scares me how I need your touch
Now I understand that
You can live with all I
--- Unknown ---
My heart is breaking
