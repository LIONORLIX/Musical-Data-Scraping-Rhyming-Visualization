------ Little Starr ------
--- Unknown ---
It's a light full of dreams
and wishes do come true
theirs a sky full of stars
but only one like you
--- Unknown ---
it takes years
it takes time
for the light to reach the earth and shine
look at you here you are
burning brihgt my little Starr
--- Unknown ---
there've been times along the way
where the distance seemed to pull are worlds apart
but on that day you were born
god hung a new star in my heart
--- Unknown ---
it takes years
it takes time
for the light to reach the earth and shine
look at you here you are
burning bright my little Starr
--- Unknown ---
so let your light dance
like the colors of the rainbow
and the rising sun
and let me take this chance
to say I'm proud of the woman that you've become
so I wish with all my might
