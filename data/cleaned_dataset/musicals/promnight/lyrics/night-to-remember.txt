------ Night to Remember ------
--- Chorus ---
Lets have the best night
of our lifetime
make a night to
Remember
Let it all out
rock the house down
paintin this town
Forever
Party non-stop
get till we drop
come out on top
Whatever
jump into it
we can do it
make this night to
Remember
--- Britney ---
Your not all that, you shouldnt have one
Youre such a loser wearing my crown
--- Starr ---
Just face the facts and get over yourself
This is my night dont bring me down
--- Langston ---
You just dont get it, you cant coexist
but just for tonight,whocare, move on let
--- Unknown ---
Chorus
--- Britney ---
Everyone knows its all about me
Your such a poser, your name wont last
--- Starr ---
You dont matter, dont matter what you say
Step aside your in my path
--- Langston ---
There will never be a time you both agree
why not take a break, enjoy the party
--- Unknown ---
Chorus
--- Britney ---
Just because the stoplights on you
and your little dreams come true
You think your hot, when your so not
--- Starr ---
Just give up your getting nowhere
I'm it and that just it
--- Langston ---
Come on girls, its getting old
why not
--- Unknown ---
Britney: Let it go
Starr:Live It up
Langston: Celebrate make a night
BSL: To Remember
No Regrets
Go all out
So it lasts
forever
