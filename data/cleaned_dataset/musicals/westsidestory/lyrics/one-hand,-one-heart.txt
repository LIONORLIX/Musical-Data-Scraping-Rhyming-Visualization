TONY (Sings)
Make of our hands one hand,
Make of our hearts one heart,
Make of our vows one last vow:
Only death will part us now.
--- MARIA ---
Make of our lives one life,
Day after day, one life.
--- BOTH ---
Now it begins, now we start
One hand, one heart;
Even death won't part us now.
--- Unknown ---
Make of our lives one life,
Day after day, one life.
Now it begins, now we start
One hand, one heart,
