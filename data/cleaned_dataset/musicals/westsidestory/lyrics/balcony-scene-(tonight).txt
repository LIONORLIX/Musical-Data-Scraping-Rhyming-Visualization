------ Balcony Scene (Tonight) ------
--- MARIA ---
Only you, you're the only thing I'll see forever.
In my eyes, in my words and in ev'rything I do,
Nothing else but you.
Ever!
--- TONY ---
And there's nothing for me but Maria,
Ev'ry sight that I see is Maria.
--- MARIA ---
Tony. Tony...
--- TONY ---
Always you, ev'ry thought I'll ever know, MARIA:
Ev'rywhere I go, you'll be, you and me! All the world is only you and me!
Tonight, tonight,
It all began tonight,
I saw you and the world went away.
Tonight, tonight,
There's only you tonight,
What you are, what you do, what you say.
Today, a1l day I had the feeling
A miracle would happen.
I know now I was right.
For here you are,
And what was just a world is a star
Tonight!
--- BOTH ---
Tonight. tonight,
The world is full of light,
With suns and moons all over the place.
Tonight, tonight,
The world is wild and bright.
Going mad, shooting sparks into space.
Today the world was just an address.
A place for me to live in,
No better than all right,
But here you are
And what was just a world is a star
Tonight!
--- TONY ---
Tonight! Tonight!
It all began tonight
I saw you and the world went away
