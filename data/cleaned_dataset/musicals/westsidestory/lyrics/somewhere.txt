------ Somewhere ------
--- A GIRL ---
There's a place for us,
Somewhere a place for us.
Peace and quiet and open air
Wait for us
Somewhere.
--- Unknown ---
There's a time for us,
Some day a time for us,
Time together with time spare,
Time to learn, time to care,
Some day!
--- Unknown ---
Somewhere.
We'll find a new way of living,
We'll find a way of forgiving
Somewhere . . .
--- Unknown ---
There's a place for us,
A time and place for us.
Hold my hand and we're halfway there.
Hold my hand and I'll take you there
Somehow,
Some day,
