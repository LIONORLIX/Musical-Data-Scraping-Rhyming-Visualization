------ Tonight (quintet) ------
--- RIFF ---
The Jets are gonna have their day
Tonight.
--- BERNARDO ---
The Sharks are gonna have their way
Tonight.
--- RIFF ---
The Puerto Ricans grumble: Fair fight.
But if they start a rumble,
We'll rumble 'em right.
--- BERNARDO ---
We're gonna hand 'em a surprise
Tonight.
--- RIFF AND JETS ---
We're gonna cut 'em down to size
Tonight.
--- BERNARDO AND SHARKS ---
We said, O.K., no rumpus,
No tricks.
But just in case they jump us,
We're ready to mix
Tonight.
--- ALL ---
We're gonna rock it tonight,
We're gonna jazz it up and have us a ball!
They're gonna get it tonight;
The more they turn it on the harder they'll fall!
--- RIFF AND JETS ---
Well, they began it!
--- BERNARDO AND SHARKS ---
Well, they began it!
--- ALL ---
And we're the ones to stop 'em once and for all,
Tonight!
--- ANITA ---
Anita's gonna get her kicks
Tonight.
We'll have our private little mix
Tonight.
He'll walk in hot and tired,
So what?
Don't matter if he's tired,
As long as he's hot
Tonight!
--- TONY ---
Tonight, tonight,
Won't be just any night,
Tonight there will be no morning star.
Tonight, tonight, I'll see my love tonight.
And for us, stars will stop where they are.
Today
The minutes seem like hours,
The hours go so slowly,
And still the sky is light . . .
Oh moon, grow bright,
And make this endless day endless night!
--- RIFF ---
I'm counting on you to be there
Tonight.
When Diesel wins it fair and square
Tonight.
That Puerto Rican punk'll
Go down.
And when he's hollered Uncle
We'll tear up the town!
--- Unknown ---
(RIFF, TONY, and MARIA sing simultaneously)
--- RIFF ---
So I can count on you, boy?
--- TONY ---
All right.
--- RIFF ---
We're gonna have us a ball.
--- TONY ---
All right.
--- RIFF ---
Womb to tomb!
--- TONY ---
Sperm to worm!
--- RIFF ---
I'll see you there about eight.
--- TONY ---
Tonight . . .
--- MARIA ---
Tonight, tonight
Won't be just any night,
Tonight there will be no morning star,
--- Unknown ---
(JETS, SHARKS, MARIA, TONY, and ANITA sing simultaneously)
--- SHARKS ---
We're gonna rock it tonight!
They're gonna get it tonight,
They began it,
They began it,
The began it.
We'll stop 'em once and for all.
The Sharks are gonna have their way,
The Sharks are gonna have their day,
We're gonna rock it tonight.
Tonight!
--- JETS ---
We're gonna jazz it tonight!
Tonight!
They began it,
And we're the ones to stop 'em once and for all!
The Jets are gonna have their way,
The Jets are gonna have their day.
We're gonna rock it tonight.
Tonight!
--- ANITA ---
Tonight, tonight,
Late tonight,
We're gonna mix it tonight.
Anita's gonna have her day,
Anita's gonna have her day,
Bernardo's gonna have his way
Tonight, tonight,
Tonight, this very night,
We're gonna rock it tonight!
--- MARIA ---
Tonight, tonight,
I'll see my love tonight.
And for us, stars will stop where they are.
--- MARIA AND TONY ---
Today the minutes seem like hours.
The hours go so slowly,
And still the skiy is light.
Oh moon, grow bright,
And make this endless day endless night,
--- ALL ---
Tonight!
