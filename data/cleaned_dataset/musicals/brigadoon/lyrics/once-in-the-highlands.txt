------ Once in the Highlands ------
--- CHORUS ---
Once in the Highlands, the Highlands of Scotland,
Deep in the night on a murky brae;
There in the Highlands, the Highlands of Scotland,
Two weary hunters lost their way.
--- TENOR ---
And this is what happened,
The strange thing that happened,
--- CHORUS ---
