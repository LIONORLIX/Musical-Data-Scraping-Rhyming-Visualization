------ I'll Go Home With Bonnie Jean ------
--- CHARLIE ---
I used to be a rovin' lad.
A rovin' an' wanderin' life I had.
On any lass I'd frown, who would try to tie me down.
But then one day, I saw a maid,
Who held out her hand, an' I stayed an' stayed.
An' now across the green, I'll go home with bonnie Jean.
--- TOWNSFOLK ---
Go home, go home, go homw with bonnie Jean!
Go home, go home.
--- CHARLIE ---
I'll go home with bonnie Jean!
In Edinburgh I used to know a lass with an' air, an' her name was Jo;
An' every night at ten, I would meet her in the glen.
But now I'll not see her again. Especially not in the glen, at ten.
For now across the green, I'll go home with bonnie Jean!
--- TOWNSFOLK ---
Go home, go home, go home with bonnie Jean!
Go home, go home.
--- CHARLIE ---
I'll go home with bonnie Jean!
Hello to married men I've known; I'll soon have a wife an' leave yours alone.
A bonnie wife indeed, and she's all I'll ever need.
With bonnie Jean my days will fly;
An' love her I will till the day I die.
That's why, across the green, I'll go home with bonnie Jean!
--- TOWNSFOLK ---
Go home, go home, go home with bonnie Jean!
Go home, go home,
--- CHARLIE AND TOWNSFOLK ---
