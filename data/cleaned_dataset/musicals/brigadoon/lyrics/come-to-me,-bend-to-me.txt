------ Come to Me, Bend to Me ------
--- CHARLIE ---
Because they told me I can't behold ye till weddin' music starts playin';
To ease my longin' there's nothin' wrong in my standin' out here ans sayin':
Come to me, bend to me, kiss me good day!
Darlin', my darlin', 'tis all I can say,
Jus' come to me, bend to me, kiss me good day!
Gie me your lips an' don't take them away.
Come, dearie, near me so ye can hear me, I've got to whisper this softly.
For though I'm burnin' to shout my yearnin', the words come tiptoein' off me.
Oh, come to me, bend to me, kiss me good day!
Darlin' my darlin', 'tis all I can say.
Jus' come to me, bend to me, kiss me good day!
