------ Who Cares? ------
--- REPORTERS ---
We don't want to know about the moratorium,
Or how near we are to beer,
Or about the league of Nations,
Or the seventeen vacations
You have had since you've been here.
Here's the one thing that the people of America
Are beside themselves to know:
They would like to know what's doing
On the lady who is suing
You - Diana Devereaux!
--- Ev'rybody wants to know ---
What about Miss Devereaux?
From the highest to the low:
What about Miss Devereaux?
--- WINTERGREEN ---
It's a pleasant day-
That's all 1 can say!
--- MARY ---
Here's the one thing we'll announce:
Love's the only thing that counts!
--- REPORTERS ---
People want to know:
What of Devereaux?
--- WINTERGREEN ---
When the One you love is near,
Nothing else can interfere.
--- ALL ---
When the one you love is near,
Nothing else can interfere.
--- WINTERGREEN ---
Here's some information
I would gladly give the nation:
I am for the true love -Here's the only girl I do love!
--- MARY ---
I love him and he loves me
And that's how it will always be,
So what care we about Miss Devereaux?
--- BOTH ---
Who cares what the public chatters?
Love's the only thing that matters!
Who cares
If the sky cares to fall in the sea?
Who cares what banks fail in Yonkers
Long as you've got a kiss that conquers?
Why should I care?
Life is one long jubilee,
So long as I care for you
And You care for me!
--- ALL ---
If the sky cares to fall in the sea?
Who cares what banks fail in Yonkers
Long as you've got a kiss that conquers?
Why should I care?
Life is one long jubilee,
So long as I care for you
And You care for me!

Let it rain and thunder!
Let a million firms go under!
I am not concerned with
Stocks and bonds that I've been burned with.
--- Unknown ---
I love you and you love me,
And that's how it will always be.
And nothing else can ever mean a thing.
Who cares what the public chatters?
Love's the only thing that matters!
--- WHEN OF THEE I SING WAS REVIVED IN 1952. IRA GERSHWIN, CONCERNED THAT THE "BANKS FAIL IN YONKERS" REFERENCE WAS DATED, AND DECIDED TO REWRITE THE "YONKERS-CONQUERS" COUPLET. HERE ARE SOME OF THE MANY ATTEMPTS: ---
--- Unknown ---
Who cares what (if) headlines are shrieking,
Long as your kisses mine are seeking?
OR
Long as we two are cheek-to-cheeking?
--- Unknown ---
Who cares where hist'ry will place me,
Long as your lovely face will face me?
--- Unknown ---
Who cares how history bills me,
Long as you've got a kiss that thrills me?
--- Unknown ---
Who cares how history bills me,
Long as my wife appreciates me?
OR
Long as your kisses dislocate me?
OR
Long as your kiss just decimates me?
OR
Long as your kiss just decimates me?
OR
Long as your kiss just compensates me?
OR
While your kiss incapacitates me?
OR
Long as your kiss emancipates me?
OR
Long as your kiss infatuates me?
OR
While I know that your kiss awaits me?
