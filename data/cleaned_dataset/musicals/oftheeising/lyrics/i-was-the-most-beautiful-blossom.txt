------ I Was the Most Beautiful Blossom ------
--- DIANA ---
I was the most beautiful blossom
In all the Southland;
I was sent up North to enter the contest
With the understanding that the winner
Was to be the President's wife.
The Committee examined me.
My lily-white body fascinated them.
I was chosen.
It was the happiest moment of my life.
--- ENSEMBLE ---
Yes, yes, go on!
Yes, yes, go on!
--- DIANA ---
Suddenly the sky fell.
Suddenly, for no reason at all,
No reason at all,
This man rejected me.
All my castles came tumbling down.
And so I am serving him with a summons*
For breach of promise!
[*THIS AND THE NEXT LINE WERE REVISED FOR THE 1952 REVIVAL:
He may be the President - But he'll suffer
For having tricked me.]
--- ENSEMBLE ---
What! What!
The water's getting hot!
She said he made a promise,
A promise he forgot.
--- DIANA ---
It's true! It's true!
--- JUDGES ---
The day he's getting married.
You put him on the spot!
It's dirty work of Russia,*
A communistic plot!
--- [*1952 VERSION ---
She says that only she was
His true forget-me-not!]
--- WINTERGREEN ---
Please understand,
It wasn't that I would jilt or spurn 'er;
It's just that there was someone else.
--- ENSEMBLE ---
Whom?
--- WINTERGREEN ---
Who!
Mary Turner!
--- CHIEF JUSTICE ---
We're having fits!
--- ENSEMBLE ---
We're having fits!
--- CHIEF JUSTICE ---
The man admits...
--- ENSEMBLE ---
The man admits...
--- CHIEF JUSTICE ---
This little sinner...
--- ENSEMBLE ---
This little sinner...
--- CHIEF JUSTICE ---
Was really winner!
--- ENSEMBLE ---
Was really winner!
--- DIANA ---
I couldn't see...
--- ENSEMBLE ---
She couldn't see...
--- DIANA ---
His jilting me.
--- ENSEMBLE ---
His jilting she.
--- DIANA ---
And so I'm doing...
--- ENSEMBLE ---
And so I'm doing...
--- DIANA ---
A bit of suing.
--- ENSEMBLE ---
A bit of suing.
--- MEN ---
And if it's true she has a claim,
You should be called a dirty name!
--- GIRLS ---
And if it's true she has a claim,
Then you're a dirty, dirty name!
--- MARY ---
John, no matter what they do to hurt you,
The one you love won't desert you.
--- DIANA ---
I'm a queen who has lost her king!
