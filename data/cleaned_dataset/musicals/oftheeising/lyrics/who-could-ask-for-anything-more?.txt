I'm about to be a mother;
He's about to be a father;
We're about to have a baby.
I must tell it;
These doings compel it!
Oh, I'm about to be a mother;
He's about to be a father;
We're about to have a baby.
--- ENSEMBLE ---
A baby!
--- MARY ---
A baby to love and adore-
Who could ask for anything more?

She's about to be a mother;
He's about to be a father;
They're about to have a baby.
We can't bother
A budding young father!
