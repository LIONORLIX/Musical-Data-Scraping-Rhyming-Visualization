------ Of Thee I Sing ------
--- WINTERGREEN ---
From the Island of Manhattan to the Coast of Gold,
From North to South, from East to West,
You are the love I love the best.
You're the dream girl of the sweetest story ever told;
A dream I've sought both night and day
For years through all the U.S.A.
The star I've hitched my wagon to
Is very obviously you.
--- Unknown ---
Of thee I sing, baby-
Summer, autumn, winter, spring, baby.
You're my silver lining,
You're my sky of blue;
There's a love light shining
All because of you.
--- Unknown ---
Of thee I sing baby-
You have got that certain thing, baby!
Shining star and inspiration,
Worthy of a mighty nation-
Of thee I sing!
--- MARY ---
Of thee I sing, baby,
Summer, autumn, winter, spring, baby.
You're my silver lining,
You're my sky of blue.
There's a love light shining
Just because of you!
--- ALL ---
All because of you!
Of thee I sing, baby;
You have got that certain thing, baby!
--- WINTERGREEN ---
Shining star and inspiration,
Worthy of a mighty nation-
Of thee I sing!
--- ALL ---
[FACING FRONT]
Of thee I sing, baby,
Summer, autumn, winter, spring, baby!
Shining star and inspiration,
Worthy of a mighty nation -
