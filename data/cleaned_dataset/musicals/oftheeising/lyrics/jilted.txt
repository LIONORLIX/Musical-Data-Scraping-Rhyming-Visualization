Jilted, jilted,
I'm a flow'r that's wilted;
Blighted, blighted,
Till the wrong is righted;
--- Unknown ---
Broken, broken
By a man soft-spoken;
Faded, faded-
Heaven knows why!
--- Unknown ---
When man are deceivers, I'm afraid
'Tis sad to be a trusting maid.
Jilted, jilted, jilted am I.
Oh, what is there left but to die?
--- ENSEMBLE ---
Jilted, jilted,
She's a flower that's wilted;
Blighted, blighted,
Till the wrong is righted;
--- Unknown ---
Broken, broken
By a man soft-spoken;
Faded, faded-
Heaven knows why!
--- Unknown ---
Just as in the Frankie and Johnny song,
He done her wrong, he done her wrong.

Oh, what is there left but to dee?
