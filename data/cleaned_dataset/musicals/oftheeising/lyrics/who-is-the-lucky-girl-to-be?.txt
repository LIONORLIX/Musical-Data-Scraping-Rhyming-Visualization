------ Who Is the Lucky Girl to Be? ------
--- GIRLS ---
Who is the lucky girl to be?
Who is to leave the bourgeoisie?
Who is to be the blushing bride?
Who will sleep at the President's side?
Strike up the cymbal, drum and fife!
One of us is the President's future wife!
--- 4 GIRLS ---
We're in Atlantic City
To meet with the committee.
--- 4 OTHERS ---
And when they've made their mind up
The winner will be signed up.
--- 4 OTHERS ---
The prize is consequential -
Presidential!
Our bodies will bear witness
To our fitness!
--- ALL ---
If a girl is sexy
She may be Mrs. Prexy!
One of us is the President's future wife!
