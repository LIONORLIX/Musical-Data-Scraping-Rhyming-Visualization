------ Here's a Kiss for Cinderella ------
--- WINTERGREEN ---
But on this glorious day I find
I'm sentimentally inclined.
And so-
I sing this to the girls I used to know:
--- Unknown ---
Here's a kiss for Cinderella
And a parting kiss for May;
Toodle-oo, good-bye, this is my wedding day.
--- Unknown ---
Here's a parting smile for Della
And the lady known as Lou;
Toodle-oo, good-bye, with bach'lor days I'm through!
--- Unknown ---
Tho' I really never knew them,
It's a rule I must obey;
So I'm saying good-bye to them
In the customary way.
--- Unknown ---
My regards to Arabella
And to Emmaline and Kay!
Toodle-oo, dear girls, good-bye!
This is my wedding day.
--- WINTERGREEN REPEATS FIRST SIX LINES OF ABOVE; ALL OTHERS SING AGAINST THIS: ---
--- ALL OTHERS ---
He is toodle-ooing all his lady loves.
All the girls he didn't know so well,
All the innocent and all the shady loves,
Oh, ding-a-dong-a-dell!
Bride and groom, their future should be glorious-
What a happy story they will tell;
Let the welkin now become uproarious,
Oh, ding-a-dong-a-dell!
--- ENTER MARY, ESCORTED BY FULTON ---
ALL:
Clear the way!
Hail the bride!
Sweet and gay-
Here comes the bride!
--- MARY ---
Is it true or I dreaming?
Do I go to Heav'n to stay?
Never was a girl so happy on her wedding day!
--- CHIEF JUSTICE ---

[SING]
Is it true or I dreaming?
Have I come to Heav'n to stay?
Never was a girl (man) so happy on her (his) wedding day!
