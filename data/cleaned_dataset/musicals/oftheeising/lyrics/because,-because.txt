------ Because, Because ------
--- PHOTOGRAPHERS ---
Don't worry, little girl,
For even if you lose the prize -
Don't worry, little girl
Myself, I can't resist your eyes.
--- GIRLS ---
I'll worry, little boy,
Until you tell what's on your mind.
--- PHOTOGRAPHERS ---
Don't worry, little girl,
I've asked my heart and this is what I find -
Don't worry, little girl;
Don't worry, little girl.
--- GIRLS ---
Why shouldn't we worry?
--- REPORTERS ---
Because, because, because, because,
Because you're in the money
With a smile that's sweet and sunny,
I could fall for you myself.
--- Unknown ---
Because, because, because, because,
Your looks are so appealing
They have given me a feeling
I could fall for you myself.
--- Unknown ---
The thrills you're sending through me
All prove that you will do me;
And so I'm giving you me -
If they don't want you, I want you!
--- Unknown ---
Because, because, because, because,
Because your ways are simple
And your knee can show a dimple,
------ fin ------
