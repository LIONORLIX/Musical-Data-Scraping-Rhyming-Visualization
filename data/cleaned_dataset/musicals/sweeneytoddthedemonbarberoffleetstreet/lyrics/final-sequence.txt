------ Final Sequence ------
--- JUDGE ---
Where is she? Where is the girl?
--- TODD ---
Down below, your honor,
With my neighbor, Mrs. Lovett.
Thank heaven, the sailor
Did not molest her
Thank heaven too,
She has seen the error of her ways
--- JUDGE ---
She has?
--- TODD ---
Oh yes, sir... she speaks only of you.
Longing for forgiveness
--- JUDGE ---
And she shall have it!
Pretty women
--- TODD ---
Pretty women, yes
--- JUDGE ---
Quickly sir, a splash of bayrum
--- TODD ---
Sit sir, sit
--- JUDGE ---
Johanna, Johanna
--- TODD ---
Pretty women, pretty women
Are a wonder
--- JUDGE ---
Quickly man! You are in merry mood again, today, barber!
--- TODD ---
Pretty women
--- JUDGE/TODD ---
What we do for pretty women
Blowing out their candles or
Combing out their hair,
Combing out their hair, and they-)
Even when they leave
They still are there.
They're there
--- JUDGE ---
How seldom it is,
one meets a fellow spirit
--- TODD ---
With fellow tastes...
In women, at least
--- JUDGE ---
What?! What's that?!
--- TODD ---
No doubt, the years have changed me
But then, I suppose,
The face of a barber, the face
Of a prisoner in the dark
Is hardly memorable
--- JUDGE ---
Beenjamin Barker?!
--- TODD ---
Benjamin Barker!
Rest now, my friends
Rest now forever
Sleep now, the untroubled sleep
Of the angels--
--- MRS. LOVETT ---
DIE! DIE! GOD IN HEAVEN, DIE!
--- Unknown ---
(quick "Ballad Of Sweeney Todd" reprise)
--- MRS. LOVETT ---
Can it be?
Have all the demons in Hell
Come to torment me?
--- TODD ---
Why did you scream?
Does the judge still live?!
--- MRS. LOVETT ---
No! Don't touch her!
--- TODD ---
What are you talking about?
It's just some mental, old
Beggar woman--
Oh no...Oh God!
Don't I know you, she said..
You knew..
From the moment I walked into your shop
You knew my Lucy lived..
--- MRS. LOVETT ---
I was only thinking of you..
Your Lucy, a crazy hag
Picking bones and rotten spuds
Out of alley ash cans!
Would you have wanted to know
That was all that was left of her?
--- TODD ---
You lied to me..
--- MRS. LOVETT ---
No, no, not lied at all
No, I never lied, said she
Took a poison, she did
Never said that she died
Poor thing, but it left her weak in
Her head, all she did for weeks
Was just lie there in bed
Should've been in hospital,
Wound up in bedlam, instead
Poor thing, better you to think
She was dead, yes,
I lied, 'cause I love you
I'd be twice the wive she was!
I love you!
--- TODD ---
Lucy, I've come home again
Lucy, oh my God!
TODD:
Mrs. Lovett, you're a bloody wonder
Eminently practical, and yet
Appropriate as always
As you've said, repeatedly,
There's little point in
Dwelling on the past
Now come here, my love
Nothing left to fear my love
What's dead, is dead
--- MRS. LOVETT ---
Do you mean it?
Everything I did, I swear,
I thought was only for the best
Believe me, can we,
Still be, married?
--- TODD ---
The history of the world, my pet
Is learn forgiveness, and try
To forget
And life is for the alive, my dear
So let's keep living it,
Just keep living it
Really living it!
--- MRS. LOVETT ---
Oh Mr. Todd, ooh Mr. Todd,
Leave it to me
Dont you see, Mr. Todd,
We'll be comfy cozy, you and me
Mr. Todd, where there's no one nosey
Just keep living it,
Really living it--
--- TODD ---
There was a barber and his wife,
And she was beautiful
A foolish barbr and his wife,
She was his reason and his life
And she was beautiful,
And she was virtuous,
And he was, naive
--- TOBIAS ---
Patty cake, patty cake
Baker's man,
Bake me a cake..no, no..
Bake me a pie, to delight my eye..
Mr. Todd? Oh..
Where's the old woman?
You've harmed her too, have you?
You shouldn't, you know?
You shouldn't harm nobody..
Oh, razor, razor
Cut-a, cut-a, cut-a, cut-a
Bat him, and prick him,
And mark him with a B
And put him in the over for baby
And me
