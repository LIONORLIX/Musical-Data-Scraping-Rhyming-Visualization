------ Ladies and their Sensibilities ------
--- JUDGE (spoken) ---
Walk home with me,
For I have news for you.
In order to shield her from the evils of this world,
I have decided to marry Johanna next Monday.
--- BEADLE (spoken) ---
Ah, sir!
Happy news, indeed!
--- JUDGE (spoken) ---
Strange...
When I offered myself to her,
She showed a certain reluctance.
--- BEADLE (sung) ---
Excuse me, my lord
May I request, my lord
Permission, my lord
To speak?
Forgive me, my lord
If I suggest, my lord
You're looking not your best, my lord
There's powder upon your vest, my lord
And stubble upon your cheek
And ladies, my lord, are weak.
--- JUDGE (spoken) ---
Perhaps!
If she greets me cordially upon my return,
I shall give her a small gift!
--- BEADLE ---
Ladies and their sensitivities, my lord!
Have a fragile sensibility.
When a girl's emergent,
Probably, it's urgent,
You refer to her gentility, my lord!
Personal disorder cannot be ignored
Given their gentile proclivities,
Meaning no offenses
It happens they resense it
Ladies and their sensitivities, my lord!
--- JUDGE (spoken) ---
Stubble, you say?
Perhaps at times I am a little over-hasty with my morning ablutions,
--- BEADLE ---
Fret not though, my lord!
I know a place, my lord
A barber, my lord, of skill!
Thus armed with a shaven face, my lord
Some older cologne to brace, my lord
And musk to enhance the chase, my lord
You'll dazzle the girl until...
--- JUDGE (spoken) ---
Until?
--- BEADLE ---
She bows to your every will.
--- JUDGE (spoken) ---
Perhaps you may be right!
