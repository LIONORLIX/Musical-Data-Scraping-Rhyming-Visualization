Pretty women
Fascinating...
Sipping coffee,
Dancing... pretty women
Pretty women
Are a wonder.
Pretty women!
--- Unknown ---
Sitting in the window or
Standing on the stair
Something in them cheers the air.
--- Unknown ---
Pretty women
Silhouetted...
Stay within you,
Glancing... stay forever,
Breathing lightly...
Pretty women,
Pretty women!
--- Unknown ---
Blowing out their candles or
Combing out their hair,
Even when they leave
They still are there.
They're there
--- Unknown ---
Ah! Pretty women, at their mirrors,
In their gardens,
Letter-writing,
Flower-picking,
Weather-watching.
How they make a man sing!
--- Unknown ---
Proof of heaven as you're living,
Pretty women! Yes, pretty women!
Here's to pretty women,
Pretty women,
Pretty women,
