------ Kiss Me ------
--- JOHANNA (counterpoint with ANTHONY) ---
He means to marry me Monday
What should I do?
I'd rather die
--- ANTHONY (counterpoint with JOHANNA) ---
I have a plan
--- JOHANNA ---
I'll swallow poison on Sunday
That's what I'll do
I'll get some lye
--- ANTHONY ---
I have a plan!
--- JOHANNA ---
Oh, dear! Was that a noise?
--- ANTHONY ---
A plan!
--- JOHANNA ---
I think I heard a noise!
--- ANTHONY ---
A plan!
--- JOHANNA ---
It couldn't be!
He's in court,
He's in court today,
Still that was a noise...
Wasn't that a noise?
You must have heard that ?
--- ANTHONY ---
Kiss me!
--- JOHANNA ---
Oh, sir!
--- ANTHONY ---
Ah, miss!
--- JOHANNA ---
Oh, sir!
If he should marry me Monday,
What shall I do?
I'll die of grief.
--- ANTHONY ---
We fly tonight ?
--- JOHANNA ---
'Tis Friday, virtually Sunday,
What can we do with time so brief?
--- ANTHONY ---
We fly tonight ?
--- JOHANNA ---
Behind the curtain, quick!
--- ANTHONY ---
Tonight ?
--- JOHANNA ---
I think I heard a click!
--- ANTHONY ---
Tonight!
--- JOHANNA ---
It was a gate!
It's the gate!
We don't have a gate.
Still there was a ? Wait!
There's another click!
You must have heard that ?
--- ANTHONY ---
It's not a gate.
There's no gate,
You don't have a gate.
If you'd only listen miss and...
Kiss me!
--- JOHANNA ---
Tonight?
--- ANTHONY ---
Kiss me!
--- JOHANNA ---
You mean tonight?
--- ANTHONY ---
The plan is made!
--- JOHANNA ---
Oh, sir!
--- Unknown ---
ANTHONY;
So kiss me!
--- JOHANNA ---
I feel a fright!
--- ANTHONY ---
Be not afraid!
--- JOHANNA ---
Sir, I did
Love you even as I
Saw you, even as it
Did not matter that I
Did not know your name...
--- ANTHONY ---
Tonight I'll steal you!
--- JOHANNA, ---
I'll steal you...
--- ANTHONY ---
It's me you'll marry on Monday,
That's what you'll do!
--- JOHANNA ---
And gladly, sir.
--- ANTHONY ---
St. Dunstan's, noon.
--- JOHANNA ---
I knew I'd be with you one day,
Even not knowing who you were.
I feared you'd never come,
That you'd been called away,
That you'd been killed,
Had the plague,
Were in debtor's jail,
Trampled by a horse,
Gone to sea again,
Arrested by the ?
--- JOHANNA ---
Kiss me!
--- ANTHONY ---
Of course!
--- JOHANNA ---
Quickly!
--- ANTHONY ---
Ah, miss!
Marry me! Marry me miss!
Oh, marry me Monday!
Favor me! Favor me
With your hand!
Promise!
Marry me! Marry me, please!
Oh, marry me Monday ?
--- ANTHONY ---
You're sure?
--- JOHANNA ---
Kiss me!
--- ANTHONY ---
I shall!
--- JOHANNA ---
Kiss me!
