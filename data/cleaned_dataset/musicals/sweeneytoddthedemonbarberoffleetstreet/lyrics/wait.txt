------ Wait ------
--- MRS. LOVETT ---
Easy now,
Hush, love, hush,
Don't distress yourself,
What's your rush?
Keep your thoughts
Nice and lush,
Wait.
--- Unknown ---
Hush, love, hush,
Think it through.
Once it bubbles, then
What's to do?
Watch it close.
Let it brew.
Wait.
--- Unknown ---
I've been thinkin' flowers,
Maybe daisies,
To brighten up the room!
Don't you think some flowers,
Pretty daisies,
Might relieve the gloom?
Ah, wait,
Love, wait.

TODD: (spoken) And the judge? When will I get to him?
--- LOVETT ---
Can't you think of nothin' else?
Always broodin' away on your wrongs
what happened heaven knows how many years ago!
--- Unknown ---
Slow, love, slow.
Time's so fast.
Now goes quickly, see
Now it's past!
Soon will come,
Soon will last.
Wait.
--- Unknown ---
Don't you know,
Silly man?
Half the fun is to
Plan the plan!
All good things
Come to those who can
Wait.
--- Unknown ---
Gillyflowers, maybe,
'Stead of daisies...
I dunno though...
