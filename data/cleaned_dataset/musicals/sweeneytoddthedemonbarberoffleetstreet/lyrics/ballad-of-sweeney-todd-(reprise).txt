------ Ballad of Sweeney Todd (Reprise) ------

Lift your razor high!
Sweeney!
Hear it singing!
Yes!
Stick it in the rosy skin of righteousness!
His voice was soft, his manner mild.
He seldom laughed but he often smiled.
He'd seen how civilized men behaved.
He never forgot
and he never forgave.
Not Sweeney...
Not Sweeney Todd...
