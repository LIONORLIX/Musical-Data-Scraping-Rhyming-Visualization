------ Not While I'm Around ------
--- Unknown ---
Nothing's gonna harm you, not while I'm around.
Nothing's gonna harm you, no sir, not while I'm around.
--- Unknown ---
Demons are prowling everywhere, nowadays,
I'll send 'em howling,
I don't care, I got ways.
--- Unknown ---
No one's gonna hurt you,
No one's gonna dare.
Others can desert you,
Not to worry, whistle, I'll be there.
--- Unknown ---
Demons'll charm you with a smile, for a while,
But in time...
Nothing can harm you
Not while I'm around...
--- Unknown ---
Not to worry, not to worry
I may not be smart but I ain't dumb
I can do it, put me to it
Show me something I can overcome
Not to worry, Mum
--- Unknown ---
Being close and being clever
Ain't like being true
I don't need to,
I would never hide a thing from you,
Like some...
--- Unknown ---
No one's gonna hurt you, no one's gonna dare
Others can desert you,
Not to worry, whistle, I'll be there!
Demons'll charm you with a smile, for a while
But in time...
Nothing can harm you
