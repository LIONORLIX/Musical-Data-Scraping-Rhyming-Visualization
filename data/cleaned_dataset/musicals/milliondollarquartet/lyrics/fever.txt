------ Fever ------
--- Unknown ---
Never know how much I love you
Never know how much I care
When you put your arms around me
I get a fever that's so hard to bear
--- Unknown ---
You give me fever
When you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever, in the morning
Fever all through the night
--- Unknown ---
Sun lights up the daytime
And moon lights up the night
I light up when you call my name
And you know I'm gonna treat you right
--- Unknown ---
You give me fever
When you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever, in the morning
And fever all through the night
--- Unknown ---
Everybody's got the fever
That is something you all know
Fever isn't such a new thing
Fever started long ago

Romeo loved Juliette
Juliette she felt the same
When he put his arms around her

Thou giveth fever
When we kisseth
Fever with thy flaming youth
Fever, I'm afire
Fever, yeah, I burn, forsooth

Cap'in Smith and Pocahontas
Had a very mad affair
When her daddy tried to kill him
She said, Daddy
Oh, don't you dare
--- Unknown ---
He gives me fever
With his kisses
Fever when he holds me tight
Fever, I'm his misses
So Daddy, Won't you treat him right
--- Unknown ---
Now you've listened to my story
Here's the point that I have made
Chicks were born to give you fever
Be it Fahrenheit or Centigrade
--- Unknown ---
They give you fever
When you kiss them
Fever if you live and learn
Fever, 'till you sizzle
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn
