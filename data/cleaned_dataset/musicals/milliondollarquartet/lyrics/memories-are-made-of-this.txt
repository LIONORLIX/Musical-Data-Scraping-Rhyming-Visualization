------ Memories Are Made Of This ------
--- Unknown ---
Sweet, sweet memories you gave-a me
You can't beat the memories you gave-a me
--- Unknown ---
Take one fresh and tender kiss
Add one stolen night of bliss
One girl, one boy
Some grief, some joy
--- Unknown ---
Memories are made of this
--- Unknown ---
Don't forget a small moonbeam
Fold in lightly with a dream
Your lips and mine
Two sips of wine
--- Unknown ---
Memories are made of this
--- Unknown ---
Then add the wedding bells
One house where lovers dwell
Three little kids for the flavor
--- Unknown ---
Stir carefully through the days
See how the flavor stays
These are the dreams you'll savor
--- Unknown ---
With his blessings from above
Serve it generously with love
One man, one wife
One love through life
--- Unknown ---
Memories are made of this
