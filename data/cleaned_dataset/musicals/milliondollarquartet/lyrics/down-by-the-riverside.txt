------ Down By The Riverside ------
--- Unknown ---
Gonna lay down my burden,
Down by the riverside,
Down by the riverside,
Down by the riverside.
Gonna lay down my burden,
Down by the riverside,
Down by the riverside.
Chorus:
I ain't go study war no more,
study war no more,
ain't go study war no more.
I ain't go study war no more,
study war no more,
ain't go study oh war no more.
Gonna lay down my sword and shield
Down by the riverside...
Chorus
Gonna try on my long white robe
Down by the riverside...

Gonna try on my starry crown
Down by the riverside...
Chorus
Gonna put on my golden shoes
Down by the riverside...
Chorus
Gonna talk with the Prince of Peace
Down by the riverside...
Chorus
Gonna shake hands around the world
