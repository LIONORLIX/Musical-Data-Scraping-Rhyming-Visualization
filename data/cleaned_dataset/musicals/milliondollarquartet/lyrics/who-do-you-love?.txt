------ Who Do You Love? ------
--- Unknown ---
I walk 47 miles of barbed wire,
I use a cobra-snake for a necktie,
I got a brand new house on the roadside,
Made from rattlesnake hide,
I got a brand new chimney made on top,
Made out of a human skull,
Now come on take a walk with me, arlene,
And tell me, who do you love?
--- Unknown ---
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
--- Unknown ---
Tombstone hand and a graveyard mine,
Just 22 and I don't mind dying.
--- Unknown ---
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
--- Unknown ---
I rode a lion to town, use a rattlesnake whip,

--- Unknown ---
Take it easy arlene, don't give me no lip,
--- Unknown ---
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
--- Unknown ---
Night was dark, but the sky was blue,
Down the alley, the ice-wagon flew,
Heard a bump, and somebody screamed,
You should have heard just what I seen.
--- Unknown ---
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
--- Unknown ---
Arlene took me by my hand,
And she said ooowee bo, you know I understand.
--- Unknown ---
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
