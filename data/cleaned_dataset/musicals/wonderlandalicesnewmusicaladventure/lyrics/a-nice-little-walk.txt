------ A Nice Little Walk ------
--- Hatter ---
A nice little walk
While I clarify
The who, what, where, when, and why
Of mom's peculiar connection
to dad's imperfections
--- Morris ---
A nice little walk
--- Hatter ---
Participate with me
--- Unknown ---
Both: In family therapy
--- Hatter ---
Till we're all guilt free
Be of good cheer
--- Morris ---
Dear
--- Hatter ---
Nothing's as bad as at first it seems
Once were analyzing your dreams
--- Morris ---
A theme park of Freudian themes
--- Hatter (Morris) ---
A nice little walk.
Might help us understand
Till hand in hand
Mom and you
--- Morris ---
And dad too
--- Both ---
All break through
--- Unknown ---
Take it from me -- see
--- Hatter ---
Managing stress is our specialty
--- Both ---
Warm tea
--- Morris (Hatter) ---
And some trust is the key
--- Hatter ---
A nice little walk
Or we can ride instead
All aboard my new sled
--- Morris ---
To her hive
--- Hatter ---
Big high-five
--- Both ---
