------ Once More I Can See ------
--- Unknown ---
Long ago and oh so far away
There were dreams that i recall
Full of unicorns who loved to play
Behind my garden walls
And the clouds would look like dragons tails
As they moved across the sky
And a tree could be the Prince of Wales
And little girls could fly
--- Unknown ---
I remember every moment
How it was to just be me
And to my surprise
I look through your eyes
And once more i can see
--- Unknown ---
I remember living in between
What was real and what is not
'Neath a sky of blue and a field of green
I long ago forgot
I remember rabbits running late
Underneath my mother's fence
And a singing cup and a talking plate
Who somehow both made sense
I remember every moment
I remember being free
And to my surprise
I look through your eyes
And I remember me
--- Unknown ---
For somewhere deep inside me
There's a girl from way back when
She just needs your heart to guide me
And make her see again
--- Unknown ---
I remember every moment
When my heart was young and free
And to my surprise
I look through your eyes
And once more I can see
