------ Go With The Flow ------
--- El Gato ---

Bienvenidos to the neighborhood hang
Say buenos dias to the rest of the gang
Pull up a stoop and let's relax for a while
--- Unknown ---
El Gato's gonna 'splain the facts for a while
Life's unpredictable-
--- Alice ---
--- Unknown ---
What a news flash!
--- El Gato ---
--- Unknown ---
I see you see how it is
The best laid plan of the mouse and man
Is to improvise the things you plan to do,
Get used to life on the brink
Way out on a limb
You don't need to think when it's sink or swim
No hesitating, no sense waiting
Why not jump right in and let the rhythm take you
Where you go with the flow
You used to be the best muchacha there was
Before you got so dazzled by all the buzz
The you you used to be you gotta go find
The part of you that somehow got leftbehind
Turn up the music and put the top down
Let the convertible cruiseGet some amigos and close the shop down
And then listen what El Gato says to you
My little Alice, be wise
You live on the ledge
--- Both ---
--- Unknown ---
You don't analyze about the cutting edge
--- El Gato ---
--- Unknown ---
Shut up and listen to what's missin'
Till you hear the you you used to be
and then finally
You go with the flow
You don't fight the tide
Then let your intuition be your guide
Get back in your groove, then thingsimprove when
You have decided to stop fighting it and
Finally you go with the flow
Don't need a lesson to stop your stressin'
Don't need a Ph.D
For you to heal it, you gotta feel it
Get it together and then let it be
It's a guitar
Turn up the music and keep the top down
Let the convertible cruise
--- Alice ---
--- Unknown ---
Get into gear
--- El Gato ---
--- Unknown ---
Get some amigos and close the shop down
And then close your eyes and improvise a tranquilizer
Go with the flow
--- Both ---
--- Unknown ---
You go with the flow
--- Cats, Kittens ---
--- Unknown ---
Go with the flow
You don't fight the tide
Then let your intuition be your guide
Get back your groove, then things improve when
You have decided to stop fighting it
and finally you go with the flow
--- El Gato ---
--- Unknown ---
You must learn to seize opportunities
