------ The Mad Hatter (alternative) ------
--- Unknown ---
If ya need somethin' done
Lay and Wait, hit and run
Well, there's just one name you should know
--- Unknown ---
I'm not sugar and spice
I'm more naughty than nice
And when it comes to bad, I'm a pro
--- Unknown ---
So just drop a dime on me
I will guarantee
It's a fate to complete
Check out the hat
Cause, baby, I'm where it's at
--- Unknown ---
You need someone to find
Something nasty, in mind?
Just put the Hatter hot on the trail
I can get the job done like Attila the Hun
And, buddy, that ain't no fairytale
--- Unknown ---
Let them run away
I will make them pay
Quicker than the Lady can say
Off with their heads
Well, isn't that what she said?
--- Unknown ---
I'm the Mad Hatter
Wacky as a hatter should be
The Mad Hatter
Ain't no body crazy as me
Might as well give up now
Ain't no way, no how
No one makes their get-away clean
Know what I mean?
Hatter works for the Queen
--- Unknown ---
What is true, what is not
Can both change in a shot
And, buddy, me? I couldn't care less
Uh-uh
--- Unknown ---
Cause in two seconds flat
Livin' under my hat
Is the strategy for success
I can stop a coo
With a thing or two
That you thought nobody could do
You outta know
This ain't my first rodeo
Yee-Hah!
--- Unknown ---
I'm the Mad Hatter
Dapper as a hatter should be
The Mad Hatter
Ain't nobody snapper, see?
So just surrender, dear
Or the end is near
Let's grease up that old guillotine
You think I'm mean?
Well, get a load of the Queen!
--- Unknown ---
There is nothing I won't do
There is nothing to taboo
--- Unknown ---
I will lie
I will cheat
Track you down, then hit delete
Tout suite!
So, sweetie, let me repeat
--- Unknown ---
I'm the Mad Hatter
Clever as a hatter should be
The Mad Hatter
Never pull the wool over me
I've got a welcome plan
Here in Wonderland
It's an audience with an ax
Take it from me, I'm only sayin' the facts
So sit back and relax
The Mad Hatter attacks
