Yeah
Hooooo
--- Unknown ---
Give me a dragon i can slay
Just say the word and i'll obey
Show me a damsel in distress and i'll save her
If there's a mission i'm your man
Throw in the lady if you can
No i'm not lancelot
I'll be braver
(i'?m sure to) save the day
It'll look good on my resume
I don't care about the take home pay
I just wanna be, i wanna be your
One knight who'll fight
And be a wonderland guy
One knight in sight
Who has been board certified
You'll never find another one like me,
And even if you ever do,
Show me one knight who will be half as true

(now listen here)

No matter where you wanna go, i'll take you there
Because you know
The rules of chivalry aren't quite dead yet
So you just stick around with me
I promise you you're gonna see
A happy ending riding into the sunset
When there is a real close call
I'll be shining on your wall of walls
And a knight like me cuz after all, i just wanna be
I wanna be your one knight
Stage right
Who never misses his cue
Gimme one knight who'll smite whatever comes after you
A knight who when you ask will always say
?Your every wish is my command?
I'm the one knight for alice in wonderland
--- Unknown ---
Please just give me half a chance
I'm an outsource knight so i work freelance
I don't even need a real big advance just a kiss will do
If i can be your
One knight
Alright
Technically two credits shy
Still the one knight bright white,
But still a regular guy
A knight who when you ask will always say
Your every wish is my command
I'm the one knight for this endeavor
One knight now and forever
One knight for alice in wonderland
