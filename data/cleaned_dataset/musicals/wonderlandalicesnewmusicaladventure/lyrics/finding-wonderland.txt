------ Finding Wonderland ------
--- Unknown ---
We move to fast
We miss so much
We seldom see all the miracles in front of us
A warm embrace
A human touch
And so it goes
I race around
Search high and low for a truth I used to know
When there was magic to be found
--- Unknown ---
(Chorus)
Cause finding wonderland
Is taking time to see
The child within has always been there smiling back at me
So when I close my eyes I just remember and I cant help finding wonderland
--- Unknown ---
Its not to late
Here in my prime hearts can un-break in the story's nick of time
A happy ending
A perfect rhyme
--- Unknown ---
(Chorus)
Cause finding wonderland is finding who you are
The child with in has always been there like a shining star
So when i close my eyes I see forever and I keep on finding wonderland
--- Unknown ---
Ordinary magic happens every single day
Wonderland is never far away
--- Unknown ---
Cause finding wonderland is going home again
To feel the love another gives and giving back and then
If you should lose your way reach out for someones hand and you'll be finding wonderland
Youll be finding Wonderland
