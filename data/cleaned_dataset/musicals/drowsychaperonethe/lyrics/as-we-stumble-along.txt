------ As We Stumble Along ------
--- Unknown ---
As we stumble along
on life's funny journey.
As we stumble along
into the blue.
We look here and we look there.
Seeking answers anywhere.
Never sure of where to turn or what to do.
--- Unknown ---
Still we bumble our way
through life's crazy labyrinth
Barely knowing left from right
nor right from wrong.
And the best that we can do
is hope a blue bird,
will sing his song
as we stumble along.
--- Unknown ---
It's a dismal little world in which we live.
It can bore you til you've nothing left to give.
Seven over-rated wonders, seven underwhelming seas.
Six excruciating continants.
Antarctica-oh, please.
But you musn't let it lick you
this planet oh so bland.
Keep your eyeball on the highball
in your hand.
--- Unknown ---
As we stumble along
'cross life's crowded dance floor.
As we push and we shove
we live and we learn.
And when we fin'lly leave the bar,
And we see that morning star,
we pull our boot straps up
and homeward turn.
--- Unknown ---
Then we stumble away
through dawn's blinding sun beams.
Barely knowing right from right
nor left from wrong.
But as long as we can hear that little blue bird
There'll be a song
as we stumble along.
As we stumble,
bumble,
fumble,
plumble,
--- Unknown ---
As we stumble along.
