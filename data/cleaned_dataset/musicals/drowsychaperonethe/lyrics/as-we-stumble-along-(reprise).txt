------ As We Stumble Along (Reprise) ------
--- MAN IN CHAIR ---
As we stumble along
On life's funny journey
As we stumble along
Into the blue
We look here and we look there
Seeking answers anywhere
Never sure of where to turn or
what to do

--- MAN IN CHAIR ---
Still we bumble our way

I don't want to sing tunes no

Through life's crazy labyrinth

Wedding bells will ring
Wedding bells will chime

And the best we can do
Is hope a bluebird
--- DROWSY & MAN IN CHAIR ---
Will sing his song
As we stumble along
--- ALL ---
Still we bumble our way
Through life's crazy labyrinth
--- TRIX ---
Barely knowing left from right
Or right from wrong
And the
--- ALL ---
Best that we can do
Is hope a bluebird
Will sing his song
As we stumble along
As we stumble
Bumble, fumble, tumble
