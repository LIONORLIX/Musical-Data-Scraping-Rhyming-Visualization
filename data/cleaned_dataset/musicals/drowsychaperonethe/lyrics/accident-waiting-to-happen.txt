------ Accident Waiting to Happen ------
--- ROBERT ---
There was a time I could stop on a dime
Forbearance was one of my talents
But since you've been around I can't hold my ground
I'm consistently losing my balance
--- Unknown ---
I'm an accident waiting to happen
I'm a mishap about to ensue
I'm the toy on the stair
The three legged chair
The hem that's been caught by a shoe
--- Unknown ---
When my two lovesick arms started flappin'
There was nothing my ankles could do
I'm an accident waiting to happen
So how be I happen to you
--- JANET ---
When men say I'm sweet and they fall at my feet
My heart doesn't beat any faster
But when you lose control
It touches my soul
So I'm bracing myself for disaster
--- Unknown ---
You're an accident waiting to happen
A catastrophe destined to be
--- ROBERT ---
I'm the rags in the cellar
--- JANET ---
A broken umbreller
--- ROBERT & JANET ---
A branch hanging loose from a tree
--- JANET ---
I can see myself jumpin' and clappin'
For a man who lives dangerously
--- ROBERT & JANET ---
You're/I'm an accident waiting to happen
--- JANET ---
So hurry and happen to me
--- ROBERT & JANET ---
You're/I'm an accident waiting to happen
