------ I Do, I Do in the Sky ------
--- TRIX ---
A bride and groom in a chapel
May bring a tear to the eye
But what a thrill when lovebirds trill
I do, I do in the sky
When vows are said in a meadow
The bees and daffodil sigh
--- ALL ---
When vows are said in a meadow
Ahhhh
--- TRIX ---
But heartbeats rush when sweethearts gush
--- ALL ---
I do, I do in the sky
--- TRIX ---
Do you?
--- TOTTENDALE & UNDERLING ---
We do
--- TRIX ---
Do you?
--- DROWSY A& ALDOLPHO ---
We do
--- TRIX ---
Do you?
--- FELDZIG & KITTY ---
We do
--- TRIX ---
Do you?
--- ROBERT & JANET ---
We do
--- ALL ---
A bride and groom in a chapel
May bring a tear to the eye
--- TRIX ---
With rainbows bending before us
And clouds meandering by
One can't restrain that sweet refrain
--- ALL ---
I do, I do in the sky
When vows are said in a meadow
The bees and daffodil sigh
--- TRIX ---
But heartbeats rush
When sweethearts gush
--- ALL ---
I do, I do in the sky
I do, I do in the sky
--- MEN ---
Look! Up ahead! Do you see it?
--- WOMEN ---
Could it be? Yes! It's Rio
--- Unknown ---
JANET: (spoken)
Well, hurry up Trix. We've got some honeymooning to do!
--- ALL ---
Then fly-y-y-y-y
Then fly
--- TRIX ---
Then fly
--- ALL ---
It's such a thrill
When lovebirds trill
Let's fly
And clouds meandering by
--- TRIX ---
One can't restrain that sweet refrain
--- ALL ---
I do
I do
Up in the sky!
