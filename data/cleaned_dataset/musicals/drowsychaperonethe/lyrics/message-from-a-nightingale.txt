You no bow?  Emperor and American rady no see eye to eye
--- AMERICAN LADY ---
--- Unknown ---
But Emperor, sometimes a different outlook can
change your point of view.
--- THE EMPEROR ---
--- Unknown ---
Whaaaa?
--- AMERICAN LADY ---
Precisely.
What is it about the Asians
That fascinates Caucasians
What is it about the Asians
That's so nice
Is it the won tons?  The egg rolls?  The rice?
Perhaps it's Buddha or Confucius and their
excellent advice
--- THE EMPEROR ---
--- Unknown ---
What is it about Caucasians
That mystifies we Asians?
What is it about Caucasians that's so odd?
They call a pretty rady a broad
They have hair upon their chest
And they only have one god?
Impossible
--- THE EMPEROR & AMERICAN LADY ---
--- Unknown ---
Whaaaaa......
--- AMERICAN LADY ---
--- Unknown ---
Oh Emperor, you're so light on your feet
The people of the world are varied
But differences are in the plan
--- THE EMPEROR ---
--- Unknown ---
The only difference I can see
That means anything to me
Is the one between a rady and a man
--- AMERICAN LADY ---
--- Unknown ---
Don't you mean lady?
--- THE EMPEROR ---
--- Unknown ---
Rady.
--- AMERICAN LADY ---
--- Unknown ---
Precisely
What is it about the Asians
--- THE EMPEROR ---
--- Unknown ---
What is it about Caucasians
--- AMERICAN LADY ---
--- Unknown ---
What makes them so astounding
--- THE EMPEROR ---
--- Unknown ---
What makes them so confusing
--- THE EMPEROR & AMERICAN LADY ---
--- Unknown ---
It's you
