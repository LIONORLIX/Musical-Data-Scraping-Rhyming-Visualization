------ Love Is Always Lovely in the End ------

Tottendale
Love make lovers worry
Love makes lovers fret
But here's a fact on which we can depend
Just like long ago when Romeo loved Juliet
Love is always lovely in the end
--- Unknown ---
Underling (spoken)
Romeo and Juliet was a tragedy, Madam.
--- Unknown ---
Tottendale
Oh, I never read reviews
Love can start a quarrel
Love can cause a din
But love has always been a trusty friend
Twas a happy fate for Hank the Eight and Anne Boleyn
Love is always lovely in the end
--- Unknown ---
Underling (spoken)
I must point out Madam, that Anne Boleyn lost her head
--- Unknown ---
Tottendale
Yes. Because she was IN LOVE!
Love was good to Eve and Adam

Underling (spoken)
Here we go again

Tottendale (sung)
And Sampson and Delilah too

Underling (spoken)
Good grief
May I pose a question Madam?
--- Unknown ---
Tottendale (spoken)
Why yes. Of course.
--- Unknown ---
Underling (sung)
Why does nothing I sayto you ever get through?
--- Unknown ---
Tottendale (spoken)
Don't mind if I do.
--- Unknown ---
Underling and Tottendale (sung)
Love is always lovely in the end.

Tottendale
Love sneaks up behind you
Love drops from above
But love would never conciously offend
Love has certainly been kind to me and my true love
Love is alway lovely in the end
--- Unknown ---
Underling
But your husband was a brute.

Oh, Madam!
