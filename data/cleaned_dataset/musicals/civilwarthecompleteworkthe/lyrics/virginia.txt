------ Virginia ------
--- Unknown ---
There was a time...
A time of splendor and grace
When the world moved by
At a kinder pace
There was a land...
A land to pleasure the eyes
Where the old was new
And the foolish wise
I can hear Virginia
When the south wind sings
And I see her shining
On a blackbird's silver wings
And I can feel Virginia
Runnin; through my soul
When the flag unfurls
And drummers start their long, long roll
Oh, sacred ground
For which so many have died
Let us take our turn
For our country's pride
Oh, blessed place
Remember all of your sons
Who will stand and fall
'Neath the ceaseless guns
I can hear Virginia
When the south wind sings
And I see her shining
On a blackbird's silver wings
And I can feel Virginia
Runnin' through my soul
When the flag unfurls
And drummers start their long, long roll
Will I ever see her rise again?
Or are the old days gone, has the world moved on?
Will she ever grace our eyes again?
Tell me when?
I can hear Virginia
When the south wind sings
And I see her shining
On a blackbird's silver wings
And I can feel Virginia
Runnin' through my soul
When the flag unfurls
