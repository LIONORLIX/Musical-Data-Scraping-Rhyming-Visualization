------ Missing You (My Bill) ------
--- Unknown ---
I learned to chop a tree today
I laughed so hard I cried
And Billy helped and scraped his knee
But he took it all in stride
Day by day I get by
Makin' do the best I can
When the sun slowly sets
Just behind our hill
Then the memories come
In the evening chll
How I long for your touch
Like a lover will
Oh, I'm missin' you
God, I'm missin' you
My Bill
The parlor roof still leaks a bit
Where the gable meets the eave
You always meant to get to it
But I know you had to leave
Thank God there's so much to do
It's the work that gets me through
When the sun slowly sets
Just behind our hill
Then the memories come
In the evening chill
How I long for your touch
Like a lover will
Oh, I'm missin' you
God I'm missin' you
My Bill
So I count the days
And I think up ways
To speed them by
But when day is through
I remember you and cry
When the sun slowly sets
Just behind our hill
Then the memories come
In the evening chill
How I long for your touch
Like a lover will
Oh, I'm missin' you
God I'm missin' you
