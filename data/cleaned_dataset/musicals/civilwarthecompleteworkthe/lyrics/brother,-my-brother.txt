------ Brother, My Brother ------
--- Unknown ---
Brother my brother
One blue and one gray
Will meet upon a quiet field
The morn of judgement day
Brother my brother
God has heard your battle call
Now he'll watch his precious children
Learn how to stand, learn how to fall
And his eyes will look away
For his heart will so be torn
As his fields of gold turn scarlet
From the rage of battle born
And the silence of the night
Will be broken by the cries
Of the ones who've been forgotten
On the quiet field where honor lies
Give me now a splendid sun
With all his light full clear
Give me now a gentle autumn
Before the dying of the year
And some green unbloodied grass
While I can still see far
Give me one night on a river
And one unfailing star
Brother my brother
One blue and one gray
Will meet upon a quiet field
The morn of judgement day
Brother my brother
God has heard your battle call
Now he'll watch his precious children
