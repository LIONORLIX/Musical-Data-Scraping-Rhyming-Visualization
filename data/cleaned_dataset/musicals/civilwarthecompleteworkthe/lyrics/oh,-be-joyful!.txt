When this war is over
And we all have passed away
There'll be some damn fool in some damn school
Who'll write about today
He'll tell them how we all survived
This bullcrap every day
And never said that thing it was
That helped along the way

A cup of oh be joyful makes me joyful I am here
Oh be joyful... Only you can set me free
If you're good enough for U.S. Grant

Well, we march and do the double-quick
This sergeant's too damn rough
This Dixie mud is mighty slick
And this bread is hard and tough
That's the crap they put us through
But brother we obey
So thank God for his nectar
That will get us through the day

Our father who art in Washington
Abraham be thy name
Thy will be done to everyone
And Dixie take the blame
Give us our daily ration
Of crackers, salt, and pork
For thine might be the power
But let us pull the cork
The sergeant's too damn rough
This Dixie mud is mighty slick
