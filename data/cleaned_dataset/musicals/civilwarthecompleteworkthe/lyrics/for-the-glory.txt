------ For The Glory ------
--- Unknown ---
The bugle calls us to the line
From the mists of the long ago
See how the battle sabres shine
And the shadows the flags all throw
For the glory
For a land forever free
For the last best hope of mankind
For the better part of me
For the glory
For the words we hold so dear
Let us give the last full measure
Gathered here
For the glory
--- Unknown ---
Our time to stand has come at last
Let the drums start the long long roll
--- Unknown ---
The chains are gone, the die is cast
To His grace I commend my soul
--- Unknown ---
For the glory
For the Dixie that I know
For the way of life we cherish,
For the glory
For the Dixie that I know
For the way of life we cherish
Let us die, or let us go
For the glory
For the home we hold so dear
Let us give the last full measure
Gathered here
--- Unknown ---
For the glory!
--- Unknown ---
Sleep in my arms now
All your pain is passed.
Sleep, for you have travelled far
Now you are home, at last.
Go as you came here
Time to say goodbye.
Light, soft as a melody
Safe in a lullaby
--- Unknown ---
The fields are green
The rivers are unclean
And all so far from here ...
--- Unknown ---
Rest for a while, now
All you work is done.
Rest here in my waiting arms
Now that your race is run ...
--- Unknown ---
For the glory
For the men who?ve gone before
For the men who will come after
We will wage this bloody war
For the glory
For the truth we hold so dear
Let us give the last full measure
Gathered here ?
For the glory!
