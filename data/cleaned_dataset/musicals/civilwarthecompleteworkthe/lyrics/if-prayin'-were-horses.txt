Don't cry for what might have been
There ain't enough tears
To empty the ocean of my sorrow
We're strangers a'wanderin'
The prairie of years
Born to be waitin' for tomorrow
And freedom ain't comin' soon enough for me
And sure 'nough ain't comin' for free
If prayin' were horses all of us would ride
And ever I'd be by your side

Don't cry for what might have been
There ain't enough time
Just hold me and memorize my story
This country we're travelin'
Is all uphill climb
It's windy and empty and so lonely
If prayin' were horses, all of us would ride
And ever I'd be by your side

Both

Move along now like a river
Don't you ever look back
Feel our people like a river
Runnin' fast, deep and black
Don't cry for what might have been
There ain't enough tears
To empty the ocean of my sorrow
We're strangers a'wanderin'
The prairie of years
Born to be waitin' for tomorrow
And freedom ain't comin' soon enough for me
And sure 'nough ain't comin' for free
If prayin' were horses all of us would ride
And ever I'd be by your side
