------ I'll Never Pass This Way Again ------
--- Unknown ---
I was born beside this river
'Bout a half a mile from here
But I never seemed to notice
That the water ran this clear
And I've never seen that color green
Sparkle down the glen
Now I'll never pass this way again
--- Unknown ---
I have wandered through that orchard
And played among her trees
But I've never heard the secrets
That she whispers in the breeze
For the only sound on hallowed ground
Is the silence of the men
Who will never pass this way again
--- Unknown ---
It never shone as beautiful
As how it looks today
We never miss the things we love
'Til they go away
But I have heard the bugler's call
And it's time for me to leave
For there comes a day
When a man must say
I will die for what I believe
--- Unknown ---
I have often thrown my pennies
In that old wishing well
And if I had a penny
I would wish me a spell
I would kneel and pray
That here I'd stay
Forever Amen
But I'll never pass this way
No I'll never pass this way
