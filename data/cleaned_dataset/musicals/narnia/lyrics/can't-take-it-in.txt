------ Can't Take It In ------
--- Unknown ---
Can't close my eyes
They're wide awake
Ev'ry hair on my body
has got a thing for this place
Oh empty my heart
I've got to make room for this feeling
so much bigger than me
--- Unknown ---
It couldn't be any more beautiful - I can't take it in.
--- Unknown ---
Weightless in love...unraveling
For all that's to come
and all that's ever been
We're back to the board
with every shade under the sun
Let's make it a good one
