------ Where ------
--- Unknown ---
On this half lit day
With your crown beneath your wing
Every word just echoes
And the empty world sings
--- Unknown ---
Where have you gone my feather light heart?
I never imagined I could leave.
--- Unknown ---
In the glistening
Of the lost and open sky
Tiny piece of you sits
Simple wish waits for reply
--- Unknown ---
Where have you gone my feather light heart?
