------ I Want To Go To Hollywood ------

What did he see in me?
What's my attraction?
Could that face make a million men adore me?
And make a hundred camera mean explore me?
Is that the girl I see there right before me?
--- Unknown ---
I wanna be that girl in the mirror, there!
I wanna be that girl with gorgeous hair up on a silver screen most everywhere in the world!
I want to go to Hollywood
Talkies - I mean the pictures!
--- Unknown ---
I wanna have a hot time every night,
Go out and raise a little fahrenheit
Knock ev'ry duke and count and baron right off his feet!
I'll be that girl that's understood -oh!
I want to go to Hollywood.
--- Unknown ---
I wanna sing the blues
I wanna wear nice shoes
And drink illegal booze
In every late night spot
for Le Jazz Hot
--- Unknown ---
I want a breakfast, lunch and dinner there
If I'm a big box office winner there
I'll be the most well-known Berliner there ever was
I want to go to Hollywood
So I can get far away from
--- Unknown ---
Fredrichstrasse
My cold water flat,
The sofa that I sleep on behind the screen,
The noisy lodger in the next room,
My broken hand mirror,
My broken coffee pot
If things get broken, they stay broken
--- Unknown ---
In Fredrichstrasse!
The worn-out bristles on your hairbrush,
The pennies needed for the heat ev'ry hour,
And when you get sick, you stay sick
--- Unknown ---
In Fredrichstrasse,
where you live with little soap
And with hardly any hope!
--- Unknown ---
I wanna be that girl in the mirror there!
I wanna be that girl with gorgeous hair
Up on a silver screen most ev'rywhere in the world!
--- Unknown ---
I want to go to Holly-
I want to go
I want to go
I want to go
I want to go
I want to go
I have to go
I have to go
I have to go
I have to go
I have to go
--- Unknown ---
I swear that girl in the mirror
That girl in the mirror
Is going to go to Hollywood!
Hollywood!
Hollywood!
Hollywood!
