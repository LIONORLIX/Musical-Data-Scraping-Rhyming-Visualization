"Grand Hotel, Berlin. Always the same
people come, people go. Look at them.
Living the high life. But time is running out.
Elizaveta Grushinskaya, a fabeled ballerina on her
farewell tour. Raffaela Ottanio, her devoted compagnion.
Hermann Preysing, a business man, reporting to his
stock-holders. Frieda Flaemm, a typist - but not for long.
Otto Kringelein, a book-keeper, looking for life.
