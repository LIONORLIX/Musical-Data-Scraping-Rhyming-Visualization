------ And I Was Beutiful ------
--- Unknown ---
He stood and looked at me
And I was beautiful,
For it was beautiful how he believed in me.
His love was strong enough to make me anything,
So I was ev'rything he wanted me to be.
But then he walked away and too my smile with him,
And now the years blur by, but ev'ry now and then,
I stop and think of him and how he looked at me,
And all at once I'm beautiful again.
