------ I Don't Want to Know ------
--- Unknown ---
If music is no longer lovely,
If laughter is no longer lilting,
If lovers are no longer loving,
Then I don't want to know.
--- Unknown ---
If summer is no longer carefree,
If children are no longer singing,
If people are no longer happy,
Then I don't want to know.
--- Unknown ---
Let me hide ev'ry truth from my eyes with the back of my hand,
Let me live in a world full of lies with my head in the sand.
For my memories all are exciting.
My memories all are enchanted,
My memories burn in my mead with a steady glow;
So if, my friends, if love is dead,
