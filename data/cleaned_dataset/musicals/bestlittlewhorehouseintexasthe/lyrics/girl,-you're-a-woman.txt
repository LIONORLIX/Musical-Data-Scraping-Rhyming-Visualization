------ Girl, You're A Woman ------
--- Miss Mona ---
Girl, get a hold now, straighten up, look alive
Girl, you?re a woman, you?ll survive
Remember one good thing when you are moving on
Is wondering what you?ll find
And one good thing about a past that?s gone
Is leaving it behind
--- Unknown ---
Girl, you?re a woman
Keep your head up high, girl
You?re a woman
Look ?em in the eye, girl
You?re a woman startin? on your way
Girl, I think this is your lucky day
--- Unknown ---
Pull it in now
Stand up tall, look real proud
Girl, no more cryin?, not out loud
Remember one good thing about the tears you shed is
You wont do that no more
And one good thing about a dream that?s dead
You?re wiser than before
--- Unknown ---
Girl, you?re a woman,
Keep your head up high, girl
You?re a woman
Look ?em in the eye, girl
You?re a woman startin? on your way
Girl, I think this is your lucky day
--- Chorus ---
All she needs is a little bit of fixin? up
To pull herself together
She?d be pretty if she?d only try
To pull her self together
And I?ll help her, it?s as easy as can be
Pretty soon she?s gonna look a lot like me

Girl, you?re a woman,
Keep your head up high, girl
You?re a woman
Look ?em in the eye, girl
You?re a woman startin? on your way
Girl, I think this is your lucky day
