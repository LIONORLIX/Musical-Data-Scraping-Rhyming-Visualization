------ Good Old Girl ------
--- SHERIFF ---
Well, shes a good old girl
We've been some long, long miles together
And thank the Lord, she never was the clinging kind
--- Unknown ---
But she's a good old girl
We've had some fine big laughs together
And I admired the way she almost read my mind
--- Unknown ---
Never talked no foolish talk
Had no ties, and held no rules
Hell that good old girl and me,
We ain't damn fools, you know?
--- Unknown ---
We never talked too much
We didn't hold to conversation
There's lots of things I could have told her I suppose.
--- Unknown ---
But what I'd would want to tell that good old girl, she knows.
