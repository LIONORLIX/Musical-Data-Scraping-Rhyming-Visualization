------ Hard Candy Christmas ------
--- Unknown ---
Hey, maybe i'll dye my hair
Maybe i'll move somewhere
Maybe i'll get a car
Maybe i'll drive so far
They'll all lose track
Me, i'll bounce right back
Maybe i'll sleep real late
Maybe i'll lose some weight
Maybe i'll clear my junk
Maybe i'll just get drunk on apple wine
Me, i'll be just
--- Unknown ---
Fine and dandy
Lord it's like a hard candy christmas
I'm barely getting through tomorrow
But still i won't let
Sorrow bring me way down
--- Unknown ---
I'll be fine and dandy
Lord it's like a hard candy christmas
I'm barely getting through tomorrow
But still i won't let
Sorrow get me way down
--- Unknown ---
Hey, maybe i'll learn to sew
Maybe i'll just lie low
Maybe i'll hit the bars
Maybe i'll count the stars until dawn
Me, i will go on
--- Unknown ---
Maybe i'll settle down
Maybe i'll just leave town
Maybe i'll have some fun
Maybe i'll meet someone
And make him mine
Me, i'll be just
--- Unknown ---
Fine and dandy
Lord it's like a hard candy christmas

But still i won't let
Sorrow bring me way down
