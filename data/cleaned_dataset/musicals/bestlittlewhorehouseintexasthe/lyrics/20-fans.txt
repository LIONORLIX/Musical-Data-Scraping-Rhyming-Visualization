Soft summer wind held a trace of perfume.
And a fan was turning in every room.

In every room

Fevers were-a burning
The were burning
And they had to have-a

And-a vegetable garden, a few slender pines.

White painted fence, with the roses in bloom.
And a fan was turning in every room

And they had to have-a
