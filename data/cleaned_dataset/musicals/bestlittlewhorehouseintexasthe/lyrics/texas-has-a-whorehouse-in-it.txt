(Chorus) Watch dog will get you if you don't watch out
Watch dog sees and watch dog knows.
Watch keeps us on our toes
Watch dog assures you that the laws the law
No exception to the rule, watch dog ain't no fool.

Watch dog protects you, he's out on the prowl.
Guards and checks the best he can ,watch dog is a
fighting man.
Watch dog will throw, he's beam of light around
If some folks don't toe the line, watch dog's light
will shine.

(Solo) Dancing going on inside it, don't you see they gone

Bodies close together, arms and legs all rearranged.
And the sheriff does not close him down.

Watch dog going to get you
Going to shine his light on you
Watch dog going to get you
Going to shine his light on you.
