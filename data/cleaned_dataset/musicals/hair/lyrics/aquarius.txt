------ Aquarius ------
--- Unknown ---
When the moon is in the Seventh House
And Jupiter aligns with Mars
Then peace will guide the planets
And love will steer the stars
--- Unknown ---
This is the dawning of the age of Aquarius
The age of Aquarius
Aquarius!
Aquarius!
--- Unknown ---
Harmony and understanding
Sympathy and trust abounding
No more falsehoods or derisions
Golden living dreams of visions
Mystic crystal revalation
And the mind's true liberation
Aquarius!
Aquarius!

When the moon is in the Seventh House

Then peace will guide the planets
And love will steer the stars
--- Unknown ---
This is the dawning of the age of Aquarius
The age of Aquarius
Aquarius!
