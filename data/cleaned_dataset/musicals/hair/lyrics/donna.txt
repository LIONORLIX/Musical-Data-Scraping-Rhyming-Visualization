Oh
Once upon a looking-for-Donna-time
There was a sixteen year old virgin
Oh Donna oh oh Donna oh oh oh
Looking for my Donna
--- Unknown ---
I just got back from looking for Donna
San Francisco
Psychedelic urchin
Oh Donna oh oh Donna oh oh oh
Looking for my Donna
--- Unknown ---
Have you seen
My sixteen year old tattooed woman
Heard a story
She got busted for her beauty oh oh oh
Oh oh!
--- Unknown ---
Once upon a looking-for-Donna-time
Never gonna end my searchin
Oh Donna oh oh Donna oh oh oh
Looking for my Donna
--- Unknown ---
I've been to India and saw the yogi light
In South America the Indian smoke glows bright
I'm reincarnated and so are we all
And in this lifetime we'll rise
Before we fall
Before we fall
--- Unknown ---
Once upon a looking-for-Donna-time
There was a sixteen year old virgin
Oh Donna oh oh Donna oh oh oh
Looking for my Donna
--- Unknown ---
And I'm going to show her
Life on earth can be sweet
Gonna lay my mutated head at her feet
And I'm gonna love her make love to her
Till the sky turns brown
I'm evolving I'm evolving
Through the drugs
That you put down

Once upon a looking-for-Donna-time
There was a sixteen year old virgin
Oh Donna oh oh Donna oh oh oh
Looking for my Donna
Looking for my Donna
Looking for my Donna
--- Unknown ---
Donna!
