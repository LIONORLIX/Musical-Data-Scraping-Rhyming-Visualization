Folding the flag means taking care of the nation.
Folding the flag means putting it to bed for the night.
I'm lost in the folds of the flag
I'm falling through a hole in the flag
Help!

It's a beautiful day in Selma, Alabama ya'll.
Don't put it down
Best one around
Crazy for the red blue and white
Crazy for the red blue and white
--- Unknown ---
You look at me
What do you see
Crazy for the white red and blue
Crazy for the white red and blue
--- Unknown ---
Cause I look different
You think I'm subversive
Crazy for the blue white and red
Crazy for the blue white and red
--- Unknown ---
My heart beats true
For the red white and blue
Crazy for the blue white and red
Crazy for the blue white and red
And yellow fringe
Crazy for the blue white red and yellow
