------ White Boys ------
--- Unknown ---
White boys are so pretty
Skin as smooth as milk
White boys are so pretty
Hair like Chinese silk
--- Unknown ---
White boys give me goose bumps
White boys give me chills
When they touch my shoulder
That's the touch that kills
--- Unknown ---
Well, my momma calls 'em lilies
I call 'em Piccadillies
My daddy warns me stay away
I say come on out and play
--- Unknown ---
White boys are so groovy
White boys are so tough
Every time that they're near me
I just can't get enough
--- Unknown ---
White boys are so pretty
White boys are so sweet
White boys drive me crazy
Drive me indiscreet
--- Unknown ---
White boys are so sexy
Legs so long and lean
Love those sprayed-on trousers
Love the love machine
--- Unknown ---
My brother calls 'em rubble
That's my kind of trouble
My daddy warns me no no no
But I say White boys go go go
--- Unknown ---
White boys are so lovely
Beautiful as girls
I love to run my fingers
And toes through all their curls
--- Unknown ---
Give me a tall
A lean
A sexy
A sweet
A pretty
A juicy
White boy
--- Unknown ---
Black boys!
White boys!
Black boys!
White boys!
