------ Where Do I Go? ------

Where do I go
Follow the river
Where do I go
Follow the gulls
--- Unknown ---
Where is the something
Where is the someone
That tells me why I live and die
--- Unknown ---
Where do I go
Follow the children
Where do I go
Follow their smiles
--- Unknown ---
Is there an answer
In their sweet faces
That tells me why I live and die
--- Unknown ---
Follow the wind song
Follow the thunder
Follow the neon in young lovers' eyes
--- Unknown ---
Down to the gutter
Up to the glitter
Into the city
Where the truth lies
--- Unknown ---
Where do I go
Follow the children
Where do I go
Follow their smiles
--- Unknown ---
Is there an answer
In their sweet faces
That tells me why I live and die
--- Unknown ---
Follow the wind song
Follow the thunder
Follow the neon in young lovers' eyes
--- Unknown ---
Down to the gutter
Up to the glitter
Into the city
Where the truth lies
--- Unknown ---
Where do I go
Follow my heartbeat
Where do I go
Follow my hand
--- Unknown ---
Where will they lead me
And will I ever
Discover why I live and die
--- Unknown ---
Why do I live (beads, flowers)
Why do I die (freedom, happiness)
Tell my where do I go (beads, flowers)
Tell me why Tell me where (freedom, happiness)
Tell my why Tell me where(beads, flowers)
Tell me why (freedom!)
