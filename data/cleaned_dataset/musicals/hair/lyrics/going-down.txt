------ Going Down ------
--- Unknown ---
Me and Lucifer
Lucifer and me
Just like the angel that fell
Banished forever to Hell
Today have I been expelled
From high school heaven
--- Unknown ---
Elevator going down, going down, going down
Everybody going down, going down, going down
--- Unknown ---
This is my doom, my humiliation
October, not June
And it's summer vacation
Such a disgrace
How can i face the nation?
Why should this pain
Bring me such strange elation?
--- Unknown ---
Escalator going down, going down, going down
Everybody going down, going down, going down
--- Unknown ---
Emancipation proclamation
Oh Dr. Lincoln
My head needs shrinkin'
Lu lu lu lu lu lu Lucifer and me
Doomed from here
To e-ter-ni-ty!
--- Unknown ---
Going up, going down, going down, going down
Everybody going up going down going up
Down (Up)
Down (Up)
Everybody going down down down woah!
--- Unknown ---
Forgive me if I don't cry
It's like the Fourth of July
Thank God that angels can fly
Down down down
Going down down down
Going down down down
Going down...
