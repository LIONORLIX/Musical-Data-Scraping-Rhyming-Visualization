Welcome! sulphur dioxide
Hello! carbon monoxide
The air, the air
Is everywhere
--- Unknown ---
Breath deep, while you sleep
Breath deep
--- Unknown ---
Bless you, alcohol bloodstream
Save me, nicotine lung steam
Incense, incense
Is in the air
--- Unknown ---
Breath deep, while you sleep
Breath deep
--- Unknown ---
Cataclysmic ectoplasm
Fallout atomic orgasm
Vapor and fume
At the stone of my tomb
Breathing like a sullen perfume
Eating at the stone of my tomb
--- Unknown ---
I'm looking rather attractive,
Now that I'm radioactive
Just watch me spark,
I glow in the dark (She glows in the dark)
--- Unknown ---
Breath deep, while you sleep
Breath deep, deep, deep, de-deep (cough cough)
