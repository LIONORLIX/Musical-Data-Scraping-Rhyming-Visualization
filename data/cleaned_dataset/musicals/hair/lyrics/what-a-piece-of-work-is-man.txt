------ What a Piece of Work Is Man ------

What a piece of work is man
How noble in reason
How infinite in faculties
In form and moving
How express and admirable
In action how like an angel
In apprehension how like a god
The beauty of the world
The paragon of animals
--- Unknown ---
I have of late
But wherefore I know not
Lost all my mirth
This goodly frame
The earth
Seems to me a sterile promontory
This most excellent canopy
The air-- look you!
This brave o'erhanging firmament
This majestical roof
Fretted with golden fire
Why it appears no other thing to me
Than a foul and pestilent congregation
Of vapors
--- Unknown ---
What a piece of work is man
How noble in reason
--- Unknown ---
How dare they try to end this beauty?
How dare they try to end this beauty?
--- Unknown ---
Walking in space
We find the purpose of peace
The beauty of life
You can no longer hide
--- Unknown ---
Our eyes are open
Our eyes are open
Our eyes are open
Our eyes are open
