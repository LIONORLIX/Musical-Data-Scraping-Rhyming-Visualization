------ Electric Blues ------
--- Unknown ---
Tell me who do you love man?
Tell me what man?
Tell me what's it you love man?
--- Unknown ---
An old fashioned melody
--- Unknown ---
Tell me what's it that moves you?
Tell me what's it that grooves you?
--- Unknown ---
An old fashioned melody
But old songs leave you dead
We sell our souls for bread
--- Unknown ---
We're all encased in sonic armor
Beltin' it out through chrome grenades
Miles and miles of medusan chord
The electronic sonic boom
--- Unknown ---
It's what's happening baby
it's where it's at daddy
--- Unknown ---
They chain ya and brainwash ya
When you least suspect it
They feed ya mass media
The age is electric
--- Unknown ---
I got the electric blues
I got the electric blues
--- Unknown ---
Thwump... rackety... whomp
Rock... folk rock... rhythm and blues
Electronics explodin'... rackety-clack
Thwump... rackety... whomp
Plugged in... turned on
--- Unknown ---
We're all encased in sonic armor
Beltin' it out through chrome grenades
Miles and miles of medusan chord
The electronic sonic boom
--- Unknown ---
It's what's happening baby
it's where it's at daddy
--- Unknown ---
They chain ya and brainwash ya
When you least suspect it
They feed ya mass media
The age is electric
--- Unknown ---
I got the electric blues
