------ Bells Are Ringing ------
--- Unknown ---
All around, there's the sound of the midsummer night,
Bells in the air are ringing ev'rywhere.
I rush to answer in hopes that it's he,
But no, the call's not for me.
Here alone I can only imagine the sight.
Me on the town, in some bewitching gown.
But I just wait at the end ot the line,
Bells are ringing
The bells keep ringing,
Oh why,
