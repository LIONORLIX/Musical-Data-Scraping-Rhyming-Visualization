------ Long Before I Knew You ------
--- Unknown ---
Long before I knew you,
Long before I met you.
I was sure I'd find you someday somehow.
I pictured someone who'd walk and talk
And smile as you do,
And make me feel as you do right now.
All that was long before I held you,
Long before I kissed you,
Long before I touched you and felt this glow.
But now you reelly are here and now at last I know
