------ I'm Going Back ------
--- ELLA ---
I know you,
Your name is Sue,
But who am I?
I've gotta find out.
At least I'm gonna try.
--- Unknown ---
I'm going back
Where I can be me,
To the Bonjour Tristesse Brassiere Company.
They've got a great big switchboard there
Where it's just hello, goodbye.
It may be dull, but there I can be
Just me, myself, and I.
A little modeling on the side,
Yes, that's where I'll be,
At the Bonjour Tristesse Brassiere Company.
And if anybody asks for Ella, Mella or Mom,
Tell 'em that I'm going back where I came from,
To the B.T. Brasiere Company.
--- Unknown ---
Goodbye, everybody.
Goodbye, Madame Grimaldi.
Goodbye, Junior Mallet,
Santa Claus is hittin' the road.
Listen to your ever-lovin' mama.
Eat your spinach, baby,
Eat your spinach, baby, by the load.
La Petite Bergere Restaurant, adieu. Je ne reviendrai
jamais, jamais, jamais. C'est tout fini. Adieu to yeu.
So, goodbye, Max, to your dogs and your cats,
To the Duke of Windsor and his Duchess.
Bye bye, Barton and Kitchell and Hastings,
At last you're out of my clutches.
I'll miss you, but you'll carry on.
You'll never know that I've gone.
--- Unknown ---
I'm going back
Where I can be me,
To the Bonjour Tristesse Brassiere Company.
And while I'm sittin' there, I hope that I find out
Just what Ella Peterson is all about,
In that Shangri-La of lacy lingeree.
At the Bonjour Tristesse Brassiere Company.
