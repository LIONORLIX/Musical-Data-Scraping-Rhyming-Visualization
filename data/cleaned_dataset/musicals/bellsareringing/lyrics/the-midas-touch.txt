------ The Midas Touch ------
--- Unknown ---
Aaaahhhhhhh!
First you're hot and then you're cold
Then you're shy and then you're bold
But I'm always sensitive to you
--- Unknown ---
First you fill my heart with pain
Then your kiss is novocaine
That's no way sensitive to you
--- Unknown ---
You don't see anything, but it hurts
Though you can't see the pain
Ooh-oh, how it hurts
--- Unknown ---
Midas touch
The mighty, mighty, mighty, mighty Midas Touch
The Midas touch
The mighty, mighty, mighty, mighty Midas Touch
Midas touch
The mighty, mighty Midas Touch
--- Unknown ---
Gold in the mornin'
Gold in the evenin
Gold in the Summer
Gold in the Winter
Doctor Midas said to me
Be sure you take your vitamin G...O...L...D
And that's what he said to me
Yeah!
