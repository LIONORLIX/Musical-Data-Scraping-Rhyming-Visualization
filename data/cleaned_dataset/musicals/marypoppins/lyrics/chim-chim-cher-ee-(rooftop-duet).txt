------ Chim Chim Cher-ee (Rooftop Duet) ------
--- Bert ---
Up where the smoke is all billowed and curled
Pavement and stars is the chimney sweeps world
When it's hardly no day nor hardly no night
There's things off in shadows and upways in light
On the Rooftops of London...
ooo what a sight
--- Mary ---
Oh you're a sweep now, are you?
--- Bert ---
Best view in the world aye?
And who gets to see it?! The birds, the stars, and the chimney sweeps.
Nothing can beat it, aye?
Now as the ladder of life has been strung
You might think us sweeps are the bottom most wrung
Though I spends me time in the ashes and smoke
In this whole wide world there's no happier bloke.
--- Both ---
Chim Chim-in-ey
Chim Chim-in-ey
Chim Chim Cher-ee
A sweep is as lucky as lucky can be
Chim Chim-in-ey
Chim Chim-in-ey
Chim Chim Cher-oo
--- Mary ---
Good luck will rub off when he shakes hands with you
--- Unknown ---
Bert: Or blow me a kiss
--- Unknown ---
Mary: Bert!
--- Unknown ---
Bert: And that's lucky too
Does this mean you're going?
--- Mary ---
The wind has changed.
--- Bert ---
But they're good kids, Mary!
--- Mary ---
But I'd be bothering with them if they weren't! But I can't help them if they won't let me and no one is as hard to teach as a child he knows everything.
--- Bert ---
So
--- Mary ---
So they've got to do the next bit on their own.
--- Unknown ---
(Sung)
Both:
Chim Chim-in-ey
Chim Chim-in-ey
Chim Chim Cher-ee
--- Mary ---
When you're with a sweep, you're in glad company.
Goodbye, Bert.
--- Unknown ---
(Sung)
Bert:
Chim

Chim
Chim
Cher-ee
When you're with a sweep, you're in glad company.
Now where is there a more happier crew
Then thems to sing Chim Chim Cher-ee Chim Cher-oo
Chim Chim-in-ey Chim Chim
Cher-ee Chim
