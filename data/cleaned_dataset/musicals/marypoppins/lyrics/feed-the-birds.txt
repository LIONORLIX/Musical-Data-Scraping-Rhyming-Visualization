------ Feed The Birds ------
--- Bird Woman ---
Feed the birds, tuppence a bag
Tuppence, tuppence, tuppence a bag
Feed the birds, tuppence a bag
Tuppence, tuppence, tuppence a bag
--- Mary Poppins ---
Early each day to the steps of Saint Paul's
The little old bird woman comes
In her own special way to the people she call,
--- Bird Woman ---
Come, buy my bags full of crumbs
Come feed the little birds,
Show them you care
And you'll be glad if you do
Their young ones are hungry
Their nests are so bare
All it takes is tuppence from you
Feed the birds, tuppence a bag
Tuppence, tuppence, tuppence a bag
--- Mary Poppins ---
Feed the birds, that's what she cries
While overhead, her birds fill the skies
--- Unknown ---
(Chorus sings sections of melody on an "ah")
--- Mary ---
All around the cathedral the saints and apostles
Look down as she sells her wares
Although you can't see it,
You know they are smiling
Each time someone shows that he cares
--- Unknown ---
Though her words are simple and few
Listen, listen, she's calling to you
--- Bird Woman ---
Feed the birds, tuppence a bag
--- Both ---
Tuppence, tuppence, tuppence a bag
--- Bird Woman ---
Tuppence,
tuppence,
