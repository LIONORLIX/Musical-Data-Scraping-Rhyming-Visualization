------ A Spoonful of Sugar (reprise) / A Shooting Star ------
--- Mary Poppins ---
With every job when it's complete
There is a sense of bitter-sweet
That moment when you know the task is done
Though in your heart you'd like to stay
To help things on their way
You've always known they must do it alone
--- (spoken) ---
There, practically perfect and I hope it remains so.
--- Winifred (spoken) ---
Mary Poppins...?
--- Michael (spoken) ---
Mary Poppins has gone.
--- Jane (spoken) ---
She's gone because we don't need her any more.
And other families will.
--- Winifred (spoken) ---
I wonder if she's right, George, and we really could
do without a nanny from now on. Do you think?
--- George (spoken) ---
I think you'd better come and dance with me!
--- Winifred (spoken) ---
George this is serious.
--- George (spoken) ---
Look! Wasn't that a shooting star?
--- Michael (spoken) ---
You can borrow my telescope.
--- George (spoken) ---
I was right. Wish on it, Children!
Winifred - my dearest love.
--- Jane (spoken) ---
We won't forget you, Mary Poppins.
--- Michael (spoken) ---
We'll never forget!
