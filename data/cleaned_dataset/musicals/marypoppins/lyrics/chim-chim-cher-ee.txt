------ Chim Chim Cher-ee ------
--- Bert ---
Winds in the east,
There's a mist comin' in.
Like somethin' is brewin',
And 'bout to begin.
Can't put me finger on what lies in store.
But I feel,
What's to 'appen,
All 'appened before.
--- Unknown ---
A father, a mother, a daughter, a son.
The threads of their lifes are all ravelin' undone.
Something is needed,
To twist them as tight,
As the string, you might hold,
When you're flyin' your kite.
