------ Johnny Can't Decide ------
--- JONATHAN ---
Break of day, the dawn is here
Johnny's up and pacing
Compromise, or persevere?
His mind is racing
Johnny has no guide - Johnny wants to hide
Can he make a mark, if he gives up his spark?
Johnny can't decide
--- SUSAN ---
Susan longs to live by the sea,
She's through with competition
Susan wants a family
Johnny's got a tough decision
Johnny has no guide
--- JONATHAN AND SUSAN ---
Johnny wants to hide
Can he settle down - and still not drown?
--- JONATHAN ---
Drown

Johnny can't decide
--- MICHAEL ---
Michael's gonna have it all
His luck will never end
Johnny's backed against the wall
Can he bend his dreams just like his friend?

Susan's right Susan's right -
Ambition eats right Ambition eats right Johnny sees right
Through you Through you Through you

Hold on tight Hold on tight Holds so tight
To the things that To the things that
Johnny feels are true Johnny feels are true Johnny feels are true

[Speaking]
I want to write music. I want to sit down right now at the piano and write a song that people will listen to and remember, and do the same thing every morning for the rest of my life.
