------ 30/90 ------
--- JONATHAN ---
Stop the clock - Take time out
Time to regroup before you lose the bout
Freeze the frame - Back it up
Time to refocus before they wrap it up
--- Unknown ---
Years are getting shorter
Lines on your face are getting longer
Feel like you're treading water
But the riptide's getting stronger
--- Unknown ---
Don't panic, don't jump ship
Can't fight it, like taxes
At least it happens only once in your life
--- Unknown ---
They're singing, "Happy Birthday"
You just wanna lay down and cry
Not just another birthday, it's 30/90
--- Unknown ---
Why can't you stay 29
Hell, you still feel like you're 22
Turn thirty 1990
Bang! You're dead,
What can you do?
What can you do?
What can you do?
--- MICHAEL ---
Clear the runway - Make another pass
Try one more approach before you're out of gas
--- JONATHAN ---
Friends are getting fatter
Hairs on you head are getting thinner
Feel like a clean up batter
On a team that ain't a winner?
--- MICHAEL ---
Don't freak out, don't strike out
Can't fight it, like City Hall
--- JONATHAN ---
At least you're not alone
Your friends are there too
They're singing, Happy Birthday
--- Unknown ---
JONATHAN and MICHAEL
You just wish you could run away
--- JONATHAN ---
Who cares about a birthday?
But 30/90, hey
--- Unknown ---
Can't you be optimistic?
You're no longer the ingenue
Turn thirty, 1990
Boom! You're passe
--- Unknown ---
JONATHAN and MICHAEL
What can you do?
--- JONATHAN ---
What can you do?
What can you do?
--- Unknown ---
Peter Pan and Tinkerbell
Which way to Never Never Land?
Emerald City's gone to hell
Since the wizard
--- ALL ---
Blew off his command
--- JONATHAN ---
On the streets you hear the voices
Lost children, crocodiles
But you're not into
Making choices, wicked witches,
Poppy fields, or men behind the curtain
Tiger lilies, ruby slippers
--- ALL ---
Clock is ticking, that's for certain
--- JONATHAN ---
They're singing, Happy Birthday
I just wish it all were a dream
It feels much more like doomsday
Fuck
ALL
30/90
--- JONATHAN ---
Seems like I'm in for a twister
I don't see a rainbow, do you?
--- ALL ---
Turn 30 in the 90's
--- JONATHAN ---
Into my hands now
The ball has passed
I want the spoils, but not too fast
--- Unknown ---
The world is calling
It's now or Neverland
Why can't I stay a child forever
and
30/90
30/90
30/90
30/90
30/90
30/90
What can I do?
--- ALL ---
