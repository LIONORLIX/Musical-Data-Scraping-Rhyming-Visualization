------ Sunday ------
--- DINER PATRONS AND WORKERS ---
Straight back and to the left
Pick up those fucking eggs
B...ring! B...ring!
We're out of milk
Who took my rye bread?
Four waters to table seven
I'm sorry, we don't deliver on Sunday
I need table three for two, yesterday
Is there a list?
Harrington? Harrington?
Kaplan, K-a-p-l-a-n for seven
--- JONATHAN ---
Order
--- DINER PATRONS AND WORKERS ---
No, I'm sorry, those people were here first
We don't have tables for seven
Are we in smoking?
--- JONATHAN ---
Tension
--- MAN ---
I'll have the salad Nicoise and some honey bread
--- JONATHAN ---
Balance
--- WOMAN ---
I said, I wanted an omelet with no yolks
That's why you're just a waiter
--- JONATHAN ---
Brunch
Sunday
In the blue, silver chromium diner
On the green, purple, yellow, red stools
Sit the fools
Who should eat at home
Instead, they pay on
--- ALL ---
Sunday
--- JONATHAN ---
For a cool orange juice or a bagel
On the soft, green cylindrical stools
Sit the fools
Drinking cinnamon coffee
Or decaffeinated tea
--- ALL ---
Forever
In the blue, silver chromium diner
--- JONATHAN ---
Drips the green, orange, violet drool
--- ALL ---
From the fools
--- JONATHAN ---
Who'd pay less at home
Drinking coffee
--- ALL ---
Light
And dark
--- MICHAEL ---
And cholesterol
And bums
Bums, bums, bums, bums,
Bums, bums, bums, bums,
Bums,
--- Unknown ---
MAN and WOMAN
People screaming for their toast
In a small, SoHo cafe
--- JONATHAN ---
On an island in
--- JONATHAN, MICHAEL AND SUSAN ---
Two Rivers
On an ordinary
Sunday
Sunday
Sunday
Sunday!
--- MICHAEL ---
