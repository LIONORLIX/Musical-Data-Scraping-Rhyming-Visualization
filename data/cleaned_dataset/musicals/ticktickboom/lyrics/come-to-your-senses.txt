------ Come To Your Senses ------
--- KARESSA ---
You're on the air,
I'm underground
Signal's fading,
Can't be found
I finally open up
For you I would do anything
But you've turned off the volume
Just when I've begun to sing
--- Unknown ---
Come to your senses
Defenses are not the way to go
And you know,
Or at least you knew
--- Unknown ---
Everything's strange,
You've changed and I don't know what to do
To get through
I don't know what to do
--- Unknown ---
I have to laugh
We sure put on a show
Love is passe in this day and age
How can we expect it to grow?
--- Unknown ---
You as the knight
Me as the queen
All I've got tonight
Is static on a screen
--- Unknown ---
Come to your senses
The fences inside are not for real
If we feel as we did, and I do
--- Unknown ---
Can't you recall
When this all began
It was only you and me
It was only me and you
--- Unknown ---
But now the air is filled with confusion
We've replaced care with illusion
--- Unknown ---
It's cool to be cold
Nothing lasts anymore
Love becomes disposable
This is the shape of things
We cannot ignore
--- Unknown ---
Come to your senses
Suspense is fine
If you're just an empty image
Emanating out of a screen
--- Unknown ---
Baby be real,
You can feel again
You don't need a music box melody
To know what I mean
--- Unknown ---
Deep in my eyes,
What do you see
Deep in my sighs,
Listen to me
--- Unknown ---
Let the music commence from inside
Not only one sense, but use all five
--- Unknown ---
Come to your senses
Come to your senses
Come to your senses
