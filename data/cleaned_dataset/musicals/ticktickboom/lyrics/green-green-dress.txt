------ Green Green Dress ------
--- JONATHAN ---
Deep dark velvet
Hugs your silhouette
Black silk stockings,
You're my Juliet
--- Unknown ---
Soft blond hair baby,
Baby blue eyes
Cool me down
Before I jump into your thighs
--- Unknown ---
The green green dress,
Twenty buttons and a strap
The green green dress,
What a pleasure to unwrap
--- Unknown ---
Green dress,
Oh what it can do
What the green green dress
Does to me on you
Me on you
--- SUSAN ---
Let's find a chair
Where we can sit and talk
Or get some fresh air,
Maybe we could take a walk
--- Unknown ---
Tell me what you're thinkin',
Talk about your day
Tell me what to do,
I'll do anything you say
--- JONATHAN AND SUSAN ---

Green dress,
Oh what it can do
What the green green dress

Does to me on you
Me on you
--- SUSAN ---
Can I hear you laugh, babe?
Can you make me smile?
I'll forget what's on my mind
For a while
--- JONATHAN ---
Can I tie you up love?
If you tell me yes
I'll unbutton every button
Down your green green dress - ow!
