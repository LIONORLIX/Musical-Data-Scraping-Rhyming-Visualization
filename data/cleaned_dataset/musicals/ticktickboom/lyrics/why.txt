------ Why ------
--- JONATHAN ---
When I was nine,
Michael and I
Entered a talent show down at the Y
--- Unknown ---
Nine A.M. went to rehearse by some stairs
Mike couldn't sing
But I said, No one cares
--- Unknown ---
We sang "Yellow Bird" and "Let's Go Fly A Kite"
Over and over and over
Till we got it right
--- Unknown ---
When we emerged from the YMCA
Three o'clock sun had made the grass hay
--- Unknown ---
I thought,
Hey, what a way to spend a day
Hey, what a way to spend a day
I make a vow, right here and now
I'm gonna spend my time this way
--- Unknown ---
When I was sixteen,
Michael and I
Got parts in West Side
At White Plains High
--- Unknown ---
Three o'clock went to rehearse in the gym
Mike played Doc, who didn't sing
Fine with him
--- Unknown ---
We sang, "gotta rocket in your pocket"
and the Jets are gonna have their day - tonight
Over and over and over
Till we got it right
--- Unknown ---
When we emerged,
Wiped out by that play
Nine o'clock, stars and moon lit the way
--- Unknown ---
I thought,
Hey, what a way to spend a day
Hey, what a way to spend a day
I made a vow
I wonder now
Am I cut out to spend my time this way?
--- Unknown ---
With only so much time to spend
Don't wanna waste the time I'm given
Have it all, play the game - some recommend
I'm afraid, it just may be time to give in
--- Unknown ---
I'm twenty-nine,
Michael and I
Live on the west side of SoHo, N.Y.
--- Unknown ---
Nine A.M.
I write a lyric or two
Mike sings his song now on Mad Avenue
--- Unknown ---
I sing, "Come to your senses
Defenses are not the way to go
Over and over and over
Till I got it right
--- Unknown ---
When I emerge from B Minor or A
Five o'clock, diner calls, I'm on my way
--- Unknown ---
I think,
Hey, what a way to spend a day
Hey, what a way to spend a day
I make a vow - right here and now
I'm gonna spend my time this way
