------ Boho Days ------
--- JONATHAN LARSON ---
Don't step on Simon, Renaud and Phillipe
They're still on the living room floor, asleep
Flight was delayed
But they got it so cheap
In Amsterdam
--- Unknown ---
The cat jumped off of the fire escape
He's a little shook up
But he don't have a scrape
Climb up to the roof
Let's make a crepe
You bring the jam
--- Unknown ---
This is the life, bo bo, bo bo bo
This is the life, bo bo, bo bo bo
This is the life, bo bo, bo bo bo
Bohemia
--- Unknown ---
Shower's in the kitchen
There might be some soap
Dishes in the sink
Brush your teeth, if you can cope
Toilet's in the closet
You better hope
There's a light bulb in there, bo bo bo
--- Unknown ---
Dino called yesterday
The rent is overdue
Con Ed and New York Telephone are mad too
Better screen the calls for a day or two
Or cough up your share
--- Unknown ---
This is the life, bo bo, bo bo bo
This is the life, bo bo, bo bo bo
This is the life, bo bo, bo bo bo
Bohemia
--- Unknown ---
Revolving door roommates
Prick up your ears
Fourteen people in just four years
Ann and Max and Jonathan
And Jonathan and Kerri
David, Tim, no Tim was just a guest
From June to January
Margaret, Lisa, David, Susie,
Stephen, Joe and Sam
And Elsa, the bill collector's dream
Who is still on the lam
--- Unknown ---
Don't forget the neighbors
Michelle and Gay
More like a family
Than a family, hey
The cat's - Lucy, Mr. Beebe
Bouncer, rest his soul
And Finster, who took one look
And stayed for days down in that hole.
--- Unknown ---
This is the life, bo bo, bo bo bo
This is the life, bo bo, bo bo bo
This is the life, bo bo, bo bo bo
Bohemia

The garbage trucks
Have turned into limousines
Rat infested diners
Now are fancy restaurants
The gallery opens
You know what that means
There goes the neighborhood
Here come the debutantes
--- Unknown ---
But at 508 the halls
Are still that dingy brown
508, the walls are cracked or falling down
508, we all know the day it changes
Is the day we all should blow this town
--- Unknown ---
The time is flying
And everything is dying
I thought by now
I'd have a dog, a kid, and wife
The ship is sort of sinking
So let's start Drinking
Before we start thinking
Is this a life?
--- Unknown ---
Is this a life?, bo bo, bo bo bo
Is this a life?, no no, no no no
Is this a life?, bo bo, bo bo bo
Bohemia
Bohemia
Bo-he-mi-a
