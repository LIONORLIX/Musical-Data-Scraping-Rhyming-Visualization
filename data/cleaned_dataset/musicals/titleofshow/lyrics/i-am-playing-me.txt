------ I Am Playing Me ------
--- HEIDI ---
I’m standing here
Just left of center and
Something ain’t clear
When did I sign
On the line
Of this decree
--- Unknown ---
JEFF (correcting)

Sorry
Stuck in a show where I am playing me
That’s funny
--- JEFF ---
Keep going.
--- HEIDI ---
I’m trapped in a whole
Nowhere to go with my role
Strain in my neck
For an exit that
Sets me free
--- JEFF ---
Free
--- HEIDI ---
Free-ee
Stuck in a show where I am playing me
--- JEFF ---
Let’s hear the bridge
--- HEIDI ---
I insist I could make a misty
Hiding inside miss Ana Christi
And lord knows I could raise the roof
Playing the maid that goofs in Tartouf
And I could be awesome playing a dude
In the title role of the Mystery of Edwin Drood
Ooo? ooo?. Ooo? ooo..

SUSAN (as Heidi's singing)
How’s the writing?
--- HUNTER ---
It’s going. I’m getting nervous that our play is a little doughnuts for dinner.
--- SUSAN ---
Is that a show?
--- HUNTER ---
No, doughnuts for dinner? you know,
it sounds like a good idea but thirty minutes later you’re hungry for something a little meatier.
--- SUSAN ---
A little meatier’ Like, a tiny asteroid is a little meatier?
--- HUNTER ---
Exactly’ no. I mean I don’t want this to be just sketches and novelty songs linked together.
I want there to be substance, not just fluff.
Not that there’s anything wrong with fluff,
but I wanna strive for something that makes people really pay attention.
You know what I mean?
--- SUSAN ---
Uh? I totally stopped listening
--- HEIDI ---
Not a chance
For my career
To advance
And there’s no strait guys
Here for me to romance
I guess I’ll swallow my pride
And make the best of
The rest of
This spree
--- JEFF ---
Spree
--- HEIDI ---
That is the note I’m singing Jeff
Stuck in a show where I am playing me
