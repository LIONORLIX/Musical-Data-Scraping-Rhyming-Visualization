Happy opening, y'all. Hey, naked.

Stop. I'm waiting until the last minute to put on my shirt because
I get sweaty under my left pit when I'm nervous.
--- SUSAN ---
That is specific.
--- HEIDI ---
You should go onstage like that.

I would never go onstage without my shirt. We should have Jeffy take his shirt off.
--- JEFF ---
I'm not taking my shirt off.

Yeah, take your shirt off and we'll start the scene over.
Heidi, you take your top off too.

Hunter, I'm not going to take off my top.

Both of you, take off your fucking shirts so we can sell some tickets to the show!
