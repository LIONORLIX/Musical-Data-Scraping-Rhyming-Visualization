------ The Tony Award Song ------
--- HUNTER ---
What if this show won a Tony?
What if this show won a Tony Award?
Papa, would that change the way you saw your litte boy,
Now he's a man
And he needs you to...
--- JEFF ---
Stop, stop, stop, Hunter
Hunter, we agreed we weren't going to put the Tony Award song on the CD, remember?
--- HUNTER ---
But I like that song.
--- JEFF ---
I like the song too, but a Tony Award joke is too easy.
It's like making a joke about Les Miz, or Phantom of the Opera...
