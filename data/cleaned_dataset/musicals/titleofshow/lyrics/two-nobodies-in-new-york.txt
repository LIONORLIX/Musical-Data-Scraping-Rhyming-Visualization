What if this dialog were set to music?
What if what we?re saying could be said in a song?
--- HUNTER ---
Hey, that?s not a bad idea perhaps we could use it
Music in a musical, how can we go wrong?
--- BOTH ---
We could
Ask significant questions
We could
Get important points across
--- Unknown ---
Like?
--- HUNTER ---
Are we writing for art
--- JEFF ---
And is art a springboard for fame
--- HUNTER ---
And will fame get folks to trust us
--- BOTH ---
But will they trust us
If it's just us
Me and you
Two nobodies in New York
--- HUNTER ---
Hey, I think it's working we're discovering choices
Lots of things to think about when writing a show
--- JEFF ---
Yeah, creating a vehicle to showcase our voices
And I don't mean our vocal cords, I mean what's below
--- HUNTER ---
Uh-huh
--- BOTH ---
We could
Ask significant questions
We could
Get important points across
--- Unknown ---
Like?
--- HUNTER ---
Are we writing for art
--- JEFF ---
And is art a springboard for fame
--- HUNTER ---
And will fame get us a paycheck
--- BOTH ---
But will a paycheck mean that we're sellouts
And if we sell out
Will they yell out
Me and you
Two nobodies in New York
--- HUNTER ---
Key change
--- JEFF ---
Maybe someday our show will get a theater
And if not this festival then somewhere out west
--- HUNTER ---
TV actors in our show, what could be better?
--- Unknown ---
JEFF/HUNTER
Sweeter/ We could?
--- HUNTER ---
What?
--- JEFF ---
Sweeter, we?ve been over this. You know the lyric is sweeter.
--- HUNTER ---
But here's the deal. One of them sounds like it's two syllables
and the other sounds like it's three syllables, so it's
like: sweeter, the-ater. Does that rhyme?
--- JEFF ---
Yes. Sorry, Larry, from the key change. A-five, six, seven, eight!
--- Unknown ---
Maybe someday our show will get a theater
And if not this festival then somewhere out west
--- HUNTER ---
TV actors in our show, what could be swee-ater?
--- JEFF ---
Thanks. Great.
--- Unknown ---
We could get that woman who was on Empty Nest
--- HUNTER ---
Dinah Manoff, she's awesome!
--- JEFF ---
Yeah
--- HUNTER ---
She was in Grease
--- JEFF ---
Yeah!
--- BOTH ---
And Leader of the Pack!
--- Unknown ---
We could
Ask significant questions
We could
Get important points across
--- Unknown ---
Like are we writing for art
And is art a springboard for fame
And will fame get us a sitcom
And will a sitcom get us on Ellen
--- Unknown ---
And will Ellen get folks to like us
And if they like us
Will they mike us
Me and You
