Glory awaits Christian
This is Montmartre
It is a hard life we led
But we have our honor
I've never seen a diamond in the flesh
I cut my teeth on wedding rings in the movies
And I'm not proud of my address,
in the torn up town
No post code envy
But everybody's like Cristal, Maybach,
Diamonds on your timepiece
Steam ships, islands, tigers on a gold leash
We don't care,
We're not caught up in your love affair
And we'll never be royals (royals)
It don't run in our blood
That kind of lux just ain't for us
We crave a different kind of buzz
Let me be your ruler (ruler)
You can call me Queen B
And baby I'll rule (I'll rule I'll rule)
Let me live that fantasy

Now tell me Christian
What do we believe in?
Freedom Beauty Truth Love
Freedom Beauty Truth Love

Well you can bump and grind
See it's good for your mind
You can twist and shout
Let it all hang out
But you won't fool the
Children of the revolution
No you won't fool the
Children of the revolution
--- Unknown ---
Tonight, we are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter than the sun

And we'll never be royals (Tonight)
It don't run in our blood (We are young)
That kind of lux just ain't for us (So let's set the world on fire)
We can burn brighter than the sun
I've never seen a diamond in the flesh
--- Unknown ---
Tonight (But you won't fool the Children of the revolution)
We are young (You won't fool the Children of the revolution)
No you won't fool the Children of the revolution (Tonight)
We are
Freedom
Beauty
Truth
Love
