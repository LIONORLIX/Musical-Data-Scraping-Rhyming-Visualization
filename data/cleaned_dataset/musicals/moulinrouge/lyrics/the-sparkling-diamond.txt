Ladies and Gentlemen
Bohemians and Artists
Coquettes and Boulevardiers!
May I present to you our Sparkling Diamond
The unique, ?the?indomitable, the one?and only!
Satine
--- Unknown ---
Diamonds are forever
They are all?I need to please me
They can stimulate and tease me
They won't leave in the night
I've no fear that they might desert me
--- Unknown ---
Diamonds are forever
Hold one up and then caress it
Touch it, stroke it and undress it
I can see every part
Nothing hides in their heart to hurt me
--- Unknown ---
Diamonds are forever and ever and ever
A kiss on the hand may be quite continental
But diamonds are a girl's best friend
A kiss may be grand
But it won't pay the rental on your humble flat
Or help you feed your pussycat
--- Unknown ---
Men grow cold as girls grow old
And we all lose our charms in the end
But square-cut or pair-shaped
These rocks don't lose their shape
Diamonds are a girl's best friend
--- Unknown ---
Cause we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl

All the single ladies!
All the single ladies!
All the single ladies!
All the single ladies!
All the single ladies!
Now put your hands up!

Gloss on my lips
Man on my hips
Tighter than my Dereon Jeans

Acting up
Drink in my cup
I can't care less what you think
--- Unknown ---
I need no permission
Did I mention?
Don't pay him any attention
--- Unknown ---
'Cause you've had your turn
And now you're gonna learn
What it really feels like to miss me
--- Unknown ---
'Cause if you liked it
Then you should have put a ring on it
If you liked it
Then you should've put a ring on it
Don't be mad once you see that he want it
If you like it then you should've put a ring on it

Whoa uh oh uh uh oh oh uh oh uh uh oh

Diamonds are a girl's best friend
She's a brick house
She's mighty-mighty
Tiffany! No, you're never gonna get it
Cartier! Never, never gonna get it
Black Star! No, you're never gonna get it
Ross Cole! Never, never gonna get it
Talk to me Harry Zidler
Tell me all about it!
The Moulin Rouge is a state of mind
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
The Sparkling Diamond, Satine
Shine bright like a diamond

Whoa uh oh uh uh oh oh uh oh uh uh oh

If you liked it then you should've put a ring on it!
All the single ladies!
Diamonds are forever!
If you liked it then you should've put a ring on it!
All the single ladies!
Diamonds are forever and ever!
He's your guy when stakes are high
But beware when they start to descend
It's then that those louses
Go back to their spouses!
Diamonds!
Are a girl's!
Best!
Friend!
