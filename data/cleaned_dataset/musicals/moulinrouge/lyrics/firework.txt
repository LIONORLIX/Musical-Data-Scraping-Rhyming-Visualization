------ Firework ------
--- Unknown ---
Do you ever feel
Feel so paper thin
Like a house of cards
One blow from caving in
--- Unknown ---
Do you ever feel already buried deep
Six feet under screams
But no one seems to hear a thing
Do you know that there's
Still a chance for you
Cause there's a spark in you
--- Unknown ---
You just gotta ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the Fourth of July
--- Unknown ---
You don't have to feel like a waste of space
You're an original, cannot be replaced
If you only knew what the future holds
After a hurricane comes a rainbow
--- Unknown ---
Maybe the reason why all the doors are closed
So you could open one that leads you to the perfect road
Like a lightning bolt
Your heart will glow
And when it's time
You'll know
--- Unknown ---
You just gotta ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the Fourth of July
--- Unknown ---
'Cause baby you're a firework
Come on show 'em what your worth
Make 'em go Oh, oh, oh!
As you shoot across the sky-y-y
--- Unknown ---
Baby you're a firework
Come on let your colors burst
Make 'em go Oh, oh, oh!
You're gonna leave 'em going Oh,oh,oh!
--- Unknown ---
Do you ever feel
Feel so paper thin
Like a house of cards
One blow from caving in
