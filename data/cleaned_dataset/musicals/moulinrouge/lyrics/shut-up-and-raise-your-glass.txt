------ Shut Up and Raise Your Glass ------
--- Unknown ---
Oh, don't you dare look back
Just keep your eyes on me
She said you're holding back
She said
Shut up and dance with me
--- Unknown ---
This woman is my destiny
She said
Ooh, ooh
Shut up and dance with me
--- Unknown ---
So raise your glass if you are wrong
In all the right ways
All my underdogs
We will never be, never be
Anything but loud
And nitty gritty
Dirty little freaks
--- Unknown ---
Won't you come on and, come on and
Raise your glass
Just come on and, come on
Raise your glass
--- Unknown ---
We were victims of the night
The chemical, physical
Kryptonite
Helpless to the bass and the fading light
Oh, we were bound to get together
Bound to get together
--- Unknown ---
She took my arm
I don't know how it happened
We took the floor and she said
--- Unknown ---
Oh, don't you dare look back
Just keep your eyes on me
She said you're holding back
She said shut up and dance with me
--- Unknown ---
This woman is my destiny
She said
Ooh, ooh
Shut up and dance with me
Ooh, ooh
Shut up and dance with me
--- Unknown ---
Slam, slam
Oh, hot damn
What part of party don't you understand
We should just freak out
--- Unknown ---
Can't stop
Coming in hot
I should be locked up right on the spot
Why so serious?
--- Unknown ---
Oh, don't you dare look back
Just keep your eyes on me
She said you're holding back
She said shut up and dance with me
--- Unknown ---
This woman is my destiny
She said (Right on the spot)
Ooh, ooh (It's so on right now)
Shut up and dance with me
Ooh, ooh
Shut up and dance with me
--- Unknown ---
Well done Christian
We are mere moments from victory
This is our night
We are young
We are brave
We are
Bohemians
--- Unknown ---
Oh, don't you dare look back (Oh)
Just keep your eyes on me
I said you're holding back
She said shut up and dance with me
--- Unknown ---
This woman is my destiny
She said
Ooh, ooh
Shut up and dance with me
