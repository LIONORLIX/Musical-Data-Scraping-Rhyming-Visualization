------ Crazy Rolling ------
--- Unknown ---
I remember when, I remember
I remember when I lost my mind
There was something so pleasent about that place
Even you emotions have an eco
So mucho space
--- Unknown ---
Mmm
When yo're out there with out care
Yeah, I was out of tocuh
But beacuse I didn't know enough
I just need to much
--- Unknown ---
Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy?
Possibly
--- Unknown ---
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark
Finally I can see you crystal clear
So go 'head and sell me out and I'll lay your ship bare
--- Unknown ---
See how I leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and its bringing me out the dark
--- Unknown ---
The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
The scars of your love they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling
--- Unknown ---
We could have had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
And you played it to the beat
--- Unknown ---
Baby I have no story to be told
But I've heard one on you
And I'm gonna make your head burn
Think of me in the depths of your despair
Making a home down there
'Cause mine sure won't be shared
--- Unknown ---
The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
The scars of your love they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling
--- Unknown ---
We could have had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
And you played it to the beat
--- Unknown ---
My heroes had the heart
To lose their lives out on a limb
And all I remember, is thinking
I wanna be like them
Mmhmm ever since I was little
Ever since I was little it looked like fun
And it's no coincidence I've come
And I can die when I'm done
--- Unknown ---
Throw your soul through every open door
Count your blessings to find what you look for
Turned my sorrow into treasured gold
You pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow
--- Unknown ---
We could've had it all
We could have had it all
It all, it all, it all
--- Unknown ---
Maybe I'm crazy
Maybe I'm crazy
You had my heart inside your hand
But you played it, you played it, you played it, you played it
You played it, you played it, you played it
To the beat
