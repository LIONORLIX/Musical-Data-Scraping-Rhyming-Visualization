------ Come What May (Reprise) ------
--- Unknown ---
Truth, Beauty, Freedom
Love
--- Unknown ---
Never knew I could feel like this
Like I've never seen the sky before
I want to vanish inside your kiss
Every day I love you more and more
Listen to my heart
Can you hear it sing?
Telling me to give you everything
Season may change, winter to spring
But I love you until the end of time
--- Unknown ---
And there is no mountain too high
No river too wide
Sing out this song
I will be there by your side
Storm clouds may gather, stars may collide
--- Unknown ---
But I love you until the end of time
Come what may
Come what may
--- Unknown ---
I will love you until my dying day
Come what may
Hey sister go sister soul sister flow sister
