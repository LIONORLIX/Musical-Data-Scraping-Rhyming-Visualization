------ El Tango De Roxanne ------

Roxanne
--- Unknown ---
His eyes upon your face
His hand upon your hand
His lips caress your skin
It's more than I can stand
--- Unknown ---
Roxanne
You don't have to put on that red light
Walk the streets for money
You don't care if it's wrong or if it is right
--- Unknown ---
Roxanne
You don't have to wear that dress tonight
Roxanne
You don't have to sell your body to the night
--- Unknown ---
(Roxanne)
Why does my heart cry?
Feelings I can't fight
You're free to leave me, but just don't deceive me
And please believe me when I say I love you
--- Unknown ---
(Roxanne, you don't have to put on that red light)
Why does my heart cry?
Feelings I can't fight
Roxanne (screaming)
Roxanne (screaming)
