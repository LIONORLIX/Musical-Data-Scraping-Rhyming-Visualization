------ Come What May ------
--- CHRISTIAN ---
Never knew I could feel like this
Like I've never seen the sky before
Want to vanish inside your kiss
Every day I love you more and more
Listen to my heart, can you hear it sing?
Telling me to give you everything
Seasons may change, winter to spring
But I love you until the end of time
--- Unknown ---
And there's no mountain too high
No river too wide
Sing out this song and I'll be there by your side
Storm clouds may gather
And stars may collide
But I love you
Until the end of time
--- Unknown ---
Come what may
Come what may
I will love you until my dying day
Come what may
