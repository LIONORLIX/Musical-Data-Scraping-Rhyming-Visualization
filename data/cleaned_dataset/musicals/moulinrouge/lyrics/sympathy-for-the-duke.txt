------ Sympathy For The Duke ------
--- THE DUKE ---
Please allow me to introduce myself
I'm a man of wealth and taste
I've been around?for?a long long?years
Stole many a girl's soul to?waste
Please to meet you hope you guessed my name
But whats puzzling you is the nature of my game
--- Unknown ---
Well I saw you today at the reception
A glass of wine in your hand
--- SATINE ---
I knew I would meet my connection
--- THE DUKE ---
Well at your feet is this footloose man
But you can't always get what you want
--- SATINE ---
No you can't always get what you want
--- BOTH ---
You can't always get what you want
But if you try sometimes
Well you just might find you get what you need
--- THE DUKE ---
Let me please introduce myself
I'm a man of wealth and taste
And I lay traps for troubadours
Who get killed if they cut your ways
--- Unknown ---
So if you need me
Have some courtesy
Have some sympathy and some taste
Use all you're well-learned politesse
Or I'll lay your soul to waste
--- THE DUKE & MEN ---
Love sister

--- THE DUKE, MEN & SATINE ---

It's just a kiss away
It's just a kiss away

It's just a kiss away It's just a kiss away
