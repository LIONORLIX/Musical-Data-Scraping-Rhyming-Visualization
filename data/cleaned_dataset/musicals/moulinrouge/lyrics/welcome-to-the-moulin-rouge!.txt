The best things in life are free
But you can keep them for the birds and bees

Your love is such a thrill
But your love won't pay my bills

Why must I live this way?

ZIDLER: (spoken)
But there is another Paris, yes?
These are the rats of the latin quarter
The starving artists and thieves of Montmartre
Our own
Beloved
Bohemians!

Watch out you might get what you're after
Rouge, baby
Strange but not a stranger
I'm an ordinary guy
Burning down the house
--- Unknown ---
My house! out of the ordinary
That's right! Don't wanna hurt nobody
Some things sure can sweep me off my feet
Burning down the house
--- Unknown ---
Here's your ticket pack your bag
Time for jumpin' overboard
Transportation is here
Close enough but not too far
Maybe you know where you are
Fightin' fire with fire
--- Unknown ---
Let’s dance
Let’s sway
Let’s dance
Let’s sway
--- ZIDLER ---
And now it’s time for the breakdown
--- BOHEMIANS ---
Watch out you might get what you're after
Shakedown! Dreams walking in broad daylight
Hold tight wait till the party's over
Burning down the house (burnin’)
Burning down the house (burnin’)
Burning down the house (burnin’)
Burning down the house (burnin’)
