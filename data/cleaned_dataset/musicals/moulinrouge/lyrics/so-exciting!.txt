------ So Exciting! ------
--- Unknown ---
Oh, the story! Ah! Yes, uh
--- Unknown ---
There'll be
Lovers
--- Unknown ---
And singers
--- Unknown ---
And entrepreneurs
--- Unknown ---
Depravity
--- Unknown ---
Ecstasy
--- Unknown ---
And love that endures
--- Unknown ---
Worthy of even the best rock on tour
A tale in the shadows of dear sacr√©-coeur
We! See!
Along the seine
Upon it's filthy shore
The bloated corpses of those
Kill the knight before
--- Unknown ---
But it's a family show
With art both high and lows
--- Unknown ---
A tale of love
--- Unknown ---
And death
--- Unknown ---
And sex
--- Unknown ---
And money
--- Unknown ---
Dancing and away we go
--- Unknown ---
Sweet satine
Who plays our ingenue
A sparrow singing up and
Down each avenue
--- Unknown ---
She wears a thin black dress
And tells a tale of woe
Of pain and loneliness
--- Unknown ---
But that's not all, as these things go!
She's rather sick
With some obscure malaise
No doubt a crueler trick from
Wilder desperate days
--- Unknown ---
But one day
Singing through her pain
The song kicks out the rain
And there he stands
A lover
--- Unknown ---
Yes
One day, everything changes
When she meets a man
--- Unknown ---
A man
Unlike any she has known
He's uh
--- Unknown ---
A ventriloquist
--- Unknown ---
No! He's a matador
Striding across the sands of destiny
--- Unknown ---
No no no
He's a sailor
--- Unknown ---
Yes! A sailor! That's it
A man who has spent his life voyaging across the turbulent seas
--- Unknown ---
He's been searching for a mate
And now it seems like fate
A gift from God above
--- Unknown ---
A love divine forevermore
Their bodies intertwined
--- Unknown ---
But fate has many other things in store
--- Unknown ---
There's a man who already claims her
An evil gangster who runs this town
--- Unknown ---
She's unhappy and no one blames her
The most lascivious racketeer around
--- Unknown ---
He buys her love
--- Unknown ---
He buys her clothes
--- Unknown ---
He's rough but this is all the poor girl knows
--- Unknown ---
He buys her love
--- Unknown ---
There's no escape
But now a triangle has taken shape
--- Unknown ---
And so the sailor, driven mad
Determined to unseat this cad
Swears to risk his life for love
And there's our show
All of the above
--- Unknown ---
A spectacle of savagery
--- Unknown ---
A testament to lunacy
--- Unknown ---
Fun for the whole family
--- Unknown ---
And all of it designed by me
--- Unknown ---
So exciting
--- Unknown ---
The audience will stomp and cheer
--- Unknown ---
So delighting
--- Unknown ---
It will run for fifty years
--- Unknown ---
So exciting
--- Unknown ---
Make them laugh or make them cry
--- Unknown ---
So delighting
--- Unknown ---
And in the end should someone die?
--- Unknown ---
So exciting
--- Unknown ---
Make our dream reality
--- Unknown ---
So delighting
--- Unknown ---
Make it happen just for me
--- Unknown ---
Make it happen just for me
