------ Looking for a Boy ------
--- Estonia ---
I am just a little girl
Who's looking for a little boy
Who's looking for a girl to love.
--- Unknown ---
Tell me, please, where can he be,
The loving he who'll bring to me
The harmony I'm dreaming of?
It'll be goodbye, I know, to my tale of woe
When he says, hello!
--- Unknown ---
Oh, I am just a little girl
Who's looking for a little boy
Who's looking for a girl to love.
--- Cookie ---
You are just a little girl
Who's looking for a little boy
Who's looking for a girl to love.
--- Estonia ---
Tell me, please, where can he be,
The loving he who'll bring to me
The harmony I'm dreaming of?
--- Unknown ---
It'll be goodbye, I know, to my tale of woe
When he says, hello!
I am just a little girl
Who's looking for a little boy
Who's looking for a girl to love!
