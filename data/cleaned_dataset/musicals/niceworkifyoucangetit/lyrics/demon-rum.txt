Demon rum,
We'll efface you!
Demon rum,
You disgrace, you!
You're an evil too many men crave!
--- Unknown ---
Devil's brew!
Satan's nectar!
Soon shall you
Be a specter!
For we're digging your liquory grave!
--- Unknown ---
Down with sin
Alcohol we'll throttle!
When we win
The battle of the bottle!

You're a goner!
Demon rum,
On my honor --
Lips that taste of wine
Shall never touch mine!

Down with demon rum!
