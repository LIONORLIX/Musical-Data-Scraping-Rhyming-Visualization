------ Hangin' Around With You ------
--- Unknown ---
What's the use of hangin' around with you,
Hangin' around with you,
Hangin' around with you, dearie.
I never know,
I never know just where I stand!
--- Unknown ---
What's the use of bangin' around with you,
Bangin' around with you,
Bangin' around with you, dearie.
You got to give,
This little girl a bigger hand.
--- Unknown ---
You're not acting the beau,
That I once used to know.
I'm beginning to see,
That I'm likely to be,
On the shelf
--- Unknown ---
If you want me hangin' around with you,
Hangin' around with you,
Hangin' around with you, dearie
You got to learn,
You got to learn to be yourself!
