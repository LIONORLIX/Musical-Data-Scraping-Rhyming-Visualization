------ Treat Me Rough ------
--- Unknown ---
Treat me rough,
Muss my hair,
Don't you dare to handle me with care.
I'm no innocent child, baby,
Keep on treating me wild.
--- Unknown ---
Treat me rough,
Pinch my cheek,
Kiss and hug and squeeze me,
`Till I'm weak.
--- Unknown ---
I've been pampered enough, baby
Keep on treatin' me rough

--- Unknown ---
I've been pampered enough, baby
Keep on treatin' me rough,
rough, rough, rough,
Keep on treatin' me-
Keep on treatin' me rough.
