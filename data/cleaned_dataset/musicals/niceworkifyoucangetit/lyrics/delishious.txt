------ Delishious ------
--- Unknown ---
What can I say
To sing my praise of you?
I must reveal the things I feel.
What can I say
Each lovely phase of you
Just seems to baffle my descriptive powers
Four-and-twenty hours of ev'ry day
What can I say?
What is the thing I'd love to sing?
They've said you're marvelous
They've said you're wonderful;
And yet that's not it.
Now let me see; I think I've got it!
--- Unknown ---
I'm so delishious
And so caprishious;
I grow ambishious
To have you care for me.
--- Unknown ---
In that connecshion,
You're my selecshion
For true affecshion
For all the time to be.
--- Unknown ---
Oh, he's had one, two, three, four, five
Six, seven, eight, nine, ten girls before;
But now there's one, and I'm the one
The one he does adore
--- Unknown ---
'Cause I'm so delishious
And so caprishious;
If I'm repetishious,
It's cause I'm so delishious.
--- Chorus ---
You're so delishious
And so caprishious;
I grow ambishious
To have you care for me.
--- Unknown ---
In that connecshion,
You're my selecshion
For true affecshion
For all the time to be.
--- Unknown ---
Oh, he's had one, two, three, four, five
Six, seven, eight, nine, ten girls before;
But now there's one, and I'm the one
The one he does adore
--- Unknown ---
'Cause you're delishious
And so caprishious;
If I'm repetishious,
It's cause I'm so delishious!
