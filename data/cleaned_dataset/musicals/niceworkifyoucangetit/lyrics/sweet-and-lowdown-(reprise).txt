[Cookie] (simultaneously)
My advice is,
Grab a cab and go
Where the band is playing;
Milk and honey flow
Everyone is saying:
Blow, that sweet and low-down!
Low-down!

Four quarter!
Four-quarter!
Four-quarter!
Four-quarter!
Four-quarter time!
--- Unknown ---
By jo, by jing!
Zing!
Ha-cha-cha-cha-cha!
Ha-cha-cha-cha!
Go on and blow,
That sweet and lowdown
Lowdown, lowdown, lowdown, lowdown, lowdown
Grab a cab and go
Where the band is playing;
Milk and honey flow
