Life has just begun;
Jack has found his Jill;
Don't know what you've done,
But I'm all a-thrill.
--- Unknown ---
How can words express
Your divine appeal?
You can never guess
All the love I feel.
From now on, lady, I insist,
For me no other girls exist.

'S wonderful! 'S marvelous --
You should care for me!
'S awful nice! 'S paradise --
'S what I love to see!
--- Unknown ---
You've made my life so glamorous,
You can't blame me for feeling amorous.
Oh, 'S wonderful! 'S marvelous --
That you should care for me!
--- Unknown ---
Don't mind telling you
In my humble fash
That you thrill me through
With a tender pash.
When you said you care
'Magine my emosh;
I swore, then and there,
Permanent devosh.
You made all other boys seem blah;
Just you alone filled me with ahh!

Oh, 'S wonderful! 'S marvelous --
You should care for me!
'S awful nice! 'S paradise!
'S what I love to see!

My dear, it's four-leaf clover time
From now on my heart's working overtime
Oh! 'S wonderful! 'S marvelous!
That you should care for me!
--- Unknown ---
You've made my life so glamorous,
You can't blame me for feeling amorous.
'S wonderful! 'S marvelous --
That you should care for--
