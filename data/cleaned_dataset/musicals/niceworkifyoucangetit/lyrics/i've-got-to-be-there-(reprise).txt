------ I've Got to Be There (Reprise) ------
--- Unknown ---
When music is playing
And couples are swaying --
Say! I've got to be there!
I've got to be there!
--- Unknown ---
When joy's in the making
And ceilings are shaking
And there's never a care --
I've got to be there!
--- Unknown ---
Check my hat
And throw the stub away!
I'm a lamb
Who's gone astray!
--- Unknown ---
When bottles are popping
And dignity's dropping
And the women are fair --
We've got to be there!
--- Unknown ---
We've got to be there!
You've got to be there!
You've got to be there!
