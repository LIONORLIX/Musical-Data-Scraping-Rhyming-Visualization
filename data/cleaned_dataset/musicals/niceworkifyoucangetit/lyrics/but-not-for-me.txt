------ But Not for Me ------
--- Unknown ---
Old Man Sunshine, listen, you,
Never tell me dreams come true,
Just try it, and I'll start a riot,
Beatrice Fairfax don't you dare,
Ever tell me he will care,
I'm certain, It's the final curtain.
--- Unknown ---
Don't want to hear from and cheerful Pollyannas,
Who'll tell you fate supplies a mate, it's all bananas.
--- Unknown ---
They're writing songs of love, but not for me,
A lucky star's above, but not for me,
With love to lead the way,
I found more clouds of grey,
Than any Russian play could guarantee.
--- Unknown ---
I was a fool to fall, and get that way,
Hi ho! Alas! And also Lack-a-day!
Although I can't dismiss,
The memory of his kiss,
I guess he's not for me.
--- Unknown ---
I know that love's a game,
I'm puzzled just the same,
Was I the moth or flame?
I'm all at sea.
--- Unknown ---
It started off so swell,
This let's pretend,
It all began so well,
But what an end.
--- Unknown ---
The climax of the plot,
Should be the marriage knot,
------ fin ------
