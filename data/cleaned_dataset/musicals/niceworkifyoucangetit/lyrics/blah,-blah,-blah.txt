------ Blah, Blah, Blah ------
--- Unknown ---
I've written you a song
A beautiful routine.
I hope you like it.
--- Unknown ---
My technique can't be wrong;
I learned it from the screen.
I hope you like it.
--- Unknown ---
I studied all the rhymes that all the lovers sing.
Then just for you I wrote this little thing:
--- Unknown ---
Blah, blah, blah, blah, moon,
Blah, blah, blah, above
Blah, blah, blah, blah, croon
Blah, blah, blah, blah, love.
--- Unknown ---
Tra la la la, tra la la la la,
merry month of may;
Tra la la la, tra la la la la,
'neath the clouds of gray.
--- Unknown ---
Blah, blah, blah, your hair,
Blah, blah, blah, your eyes;
Blah, blah, blah, blah, care,
Blah, blah, blah, blah, skies.
--- Unknown ---
Tra la la la, tra la la la la,
cottage for two—
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,
darling with you.
--- Unknown ---
Blah, blah, blah, your hair,
Blah, blah, blah, your eyes;
Blah, blah, blah, blah, care,
Blah, blah, blah, blah, skies.
--- Unknown ---
Tra la la la, tra la la la la,
cottage for two—
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, darling with you.
