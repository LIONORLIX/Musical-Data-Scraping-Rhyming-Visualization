------ Nice Work If You Can Get It ------
--- Unknown ---
The man who only lives for making money
Lives a life that isn't necessarily sunny
Likewise the man who works for fame
There's no guarantee that time won't erase his name
--- Unknown ---
The fact is, the only work that really brings enjoyment
Is the kind that is for girl and boy meant
Fall in love and you won't regret it
That's the best work of all, if you can get it.
--- Unknown ---
Holding hands at midnight
'neath a starry sky
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try.
--- Unknown ---
Strolling with the one girl
Sighing sigh after sigh
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try
--- Unknown ---
Just imagine someone
Waiting at the cottage door
Where two hearts become one
Who could ask for anything more?
--- Unknown ---
Loving one who loves you
And then taking that vow
It's nice work if you can get it
And if you get it, won't you tell me how?
--- Unknown ---
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try.
--- Unknown ---
Loving one who loves you
And then taking that vow
It's nice work if you can get it
