------ I've Got to Be There ------
--- Jimmy ---
When I keep seeing things and going places,
My life has color;
Without new songs,
Without new friends and faces,
'Twould be much duller.
--- Unknown ---
Whenever people step up
To say, let's step tonight,
If I've been low, I pep up;
Again the future's bright!
Whenever there's a party I can go to
It makes the world seem right!
--- Unknown ---
When music is playing
And couples are swaying --
Say! I've got to be there!
I've got to be there!
--- Unknown ---
When joy's in the making
And ceilings are shaking
And there's never a care --
I've got to be there!
--- Unknown ---
Check my hat
And throw the stub away!
I'm a lamb
Who's gone astray!
--- Unknown ---
When bottles are popping
And dignity's dropping
And the women are fair --
I've got to be there!
--- Unknown ---
I've got to be there!
I've got to be there!
--- Unknown ---
When bottles are popping
And dignity's dropping
And the women are fair --
I've got to be there!
--- Chorus ---
Check his hat, just his hat
And throw the stub away!
He's a lamb, just a little lamb
Who's gone astray!
--- Jimmy ---
When bottles are popping
And dignity's dropping
And the women are fair --
I've got to be there!
I've got to be there!
I've got to be there!
I've got to be there!
