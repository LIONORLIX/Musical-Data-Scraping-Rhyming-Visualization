------ Fascinating Rhythm ------
--- Unknown ---
Got a little rhythm, a rhythm, a rhythm
That pit-a-pats through my brain;
So darn persistent
The day isn't distant
When it'll drive me insane.
--- Unknown ---
Comes in the morning
Without any warning,
And hangs around me all day.
--- Unknown ---
Someday I'll sneak up to it
And then I'll speak up to it
I hope it listens when I say;
--- Unknown ---
Fascinating rhythm
You've got me on the go!
Fascinating rhythm,
I'm all a-quiver.
--- Unknown ---
What a mess you're making
The neighbors want to know
Why I'm always shaking
Just like a flivver.
--- Unknown ---
Each morning I get up with the sun --
Start a-hopping
Never stopping --
To find at night no work has been done.
--- Unknown ---
I know that
Once it didn't matter --
But now you're doing wrong;
When you start to patter
I'm so unhappy.
--- Unknown ---
Won't you take a day off?
Decide to run along
Somewhere far away off --
And make it snappy!
--- Unknown ---
Oh, how I long to be the man I used to be!
Fascinating rhythm
Oh won't you stop picking on me?
--- Unknown ---
Oh, how I long to be the man I used to be!
Fascinating rhythm
Oh won't you stop picking on me?
--- Unknown ---
Rhythm!
It's got that rhythm!
It's got that rhythm!
