------ Lady Be Good ------
--- Unknown ---
Listen to my tale of woe,
it's terribly sad but true,
All dressed up, no place to go
Each ev'ning I'm awf'ly blue.
--- Unknown ---
I must win some handsome guy
Can't go on like this,
I could blossom out I know,
With somebody just like you. So...
--- Unknown ---
Oh, sweet and lovely lady, be good
Oh, lady, be good to me
I am so awf'ly misunderstood
So lady, be good to me
--- Unknown ---
Oh, please have some pity
I'm all alone in this big city
--- Unknown ---
I tell you I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood,
So lady be good to me.
--- Unknown ---
Oh, please have some pity
I'm all alone in this big city
--- Unknown ---
I tell you I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood,
So lady be good to me.
--- Unknown ---
Oh lady be good to me.
