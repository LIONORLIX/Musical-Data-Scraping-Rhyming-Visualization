------ I've Got a Crush on You ------
--- Unknown ---
How glad a million laddies
From millionaires to caddies,
Would be,
To capture me.
--- Unknown ---
But you had such persistence
You wore down my resistance;
I fell --
And it was swell.
You're my big and brave and handsome romeo.
How you won me I shall never, never know.
--- Unknown ---
It's not that you're attractive --
But oh, my heart grew active
When you
Came into view ...
--- Unknown ---
You've got a crush on me, sweetie pie.
All the day and nighttime, hear you sigh.
I never had the least notion
That you could fall with so much emotion.
--- Unknown ---
Could you coo, could you care
For a cunning cottage we could share?
The world will pardon your mush
'cause you've got a crush,
My baby, on me!
