------ Do, Do, Do ------
--- Unknown ---
I remember the bliss
Of that wonderful kiss
I knew that a boy
Could never have more joy
From any little miss.
--- Unknown ---
I remember it quite
'twas a wonderful night.
Oh, how I'd adore it
If you would encore it.
--- Unknown ---
Do, do, do
What you've done, done, done
Before, baby.
Do, do, do
What I do, do, do
Adore, baby.
--- Unknown ---
Let's try again,
Sigh again
Fly again to heaven.
Baby, see,
It's a b c --
I love you and you love me.
--- Unknown ---
I know, know, know
What a beau, beau, beau
Should do, baby;
So don't, don't, don't
Say it won't, won't, won't
Come true, baby.
My heart begins to hum --
Dum de dum de dum-dum-dum,
So do, do, do
What you've done, done, done
Before.
--- Unknown ---
You dear, dear, dear
Little dear, dear, dear
Come here --
Snappy!
--- Unknown ---
And see, see, see
Little me, me, me make you
Happy!
--- Unknown ---
My heart begins to sigh --
Di de di de di-di-di
So do, do, do
What you've done, done, done
