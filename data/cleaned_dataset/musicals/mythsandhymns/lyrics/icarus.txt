------ Icarus ------
--- Unknown ---
Icarus was not an achiever.
Always resented what his father could do,
Was sick and tired of the hullabaloo;
When would he ever make his mark?
Icarus was not a believer,
His father trusted him and took it for granted
That he would turn out to be just as enchanted;
That all he needed was some help getting off the ground.
--- Unknown ---
Put these on and learn to fly
A course above the ocean.
Test your strength,
Learn to change the angle of your wing.
But, Icarus, fly beneath me, shaded from the sun.
Unlimited altitude will heat up your wings and they'll come unglued.
Of the sun, you must beware
When you're gliding through the air.
You have to try to stay in my shadow.
--- Unknown ---
Icarus could see the potential
Aerodynamic mythological coup
Of being the only flying demi-go who
Dared to land on the sun.
Icarus could see the credential
And taste the glory of the journey ahead.
The light reflected off his wings when they spread.
He started singing when his feet only found air.

Look at me.
I'm going to be the stuff that myths are made of.
Divine event;
The kind of myth that makes a masquerade of a father.
Over him, I'll cast a shadow broader than the sun.
Unlimited altitude;
I like to navigate in the nude.
Breezes blowing through my hair
While I ride the dunes of air.
I think I'll let him fly in my shadow.
--- Unknown ---
He didn't try to get his ears to pop.
He liked the atmospheric pressure drop
The sky around him and the earth below.

Look at me.
I'm going to be the stuff that myths are made of.
Divine event;
The kind of myth that makes a masquerade of a father.
Over him I'll cast a shadow broader than the sun.
Unlimited altitude;
The ozone layer is rainbow hued.
Nimbus cloud about my head-
I think I'll wear it in my father's stead.
--- Unknown ---
I think the air is getting thin.
--- Unknown ---
Look at me.
I'm going \to be the stuff that myths are made of.
Divine event;
The kind of myth that makes a masquerade of a father.
Over him I'll cast a shadow broader than the sun.
