------ Migratory V ------
--- Unknown ---
We sail above the weather
We search the ocean floor.
We rival our creation,
Still yearning for more.
But can we fly together-
A migratory V?
How wonderful if that's what God could see.
--- Unknown ---
A single voice in whispered prayer
Can only pray to travel there.
But all as one,
We sound the everlasting sound
And sing our salvation.
--- Unknown ---
Aloft and in formation,
A migratory V.
