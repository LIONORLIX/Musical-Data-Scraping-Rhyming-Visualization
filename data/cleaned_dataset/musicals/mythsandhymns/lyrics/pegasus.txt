------ Pegasus ------
--- Bellerophon ---
Pegasus,
It's all I wanted, you know:
Heaven like you got,
Heaven like you got.
Pegasus,
I meant to glow like you glow:
Up in heaven too,
Heaven like you got.
In the wind your flying mane,
In my hand your golden rein,
Higher, higher and never too high
And never enough.
You know me 'cause I was your rider.
--- Unknown ---
Pegasus,
--- Pegasus ---
Yes?
--- Bellerophon ---
Is it as good as I said?
--- Pegasus ---
What?
--- Both ---
Living in the sky,
--- Bellerophon ---
Living I nthe sky.
--- Pegasus ---
Well:
--- Bellerophon ---
Pegasus,
--- Pegasus ---
Uh-huh?
--- Bellerophon ---
There was a dance on your head.
--- Pegasus ---
What dance?
--- Both ---
Heaven like you got
Ain't livin' in the sky.
--- Unknown ---
After rising from the blood:pretty!
After drinking from the flood
Higher, higher, and never too high
And never enough.
--- Bellerophon ---
Tell them how you threw your rider
--- Gadfly ---
Brrip bu bu brrip bu bu bu b u bu bu bzzip
Bu bu bu bu bu bu brrip brrip bu bu bu bu bzip bzzip bzzip, bzzip.
--- Pegasus: Bellerophon: Gadfly ---
You kept throwing it up to me. Way up Bzzip, bzzip
How I'm up here and you're way up, way down Bu bu bu
Down there, Briip, brrip, bzzip
As though I did this to you You did this to me Brrip, bu bu bu bzzip.
Gadfly:
A gadfly doesn't much deal in regret,
For a gadfly there is no remorse.
A gadfly doesn't much question her God
When her God says: Go bite that flying horse!
She bites.
That's it.
I bit.
Brrip bu bu brrip bu bu bu bu bu bu bzzip.
--- Gadfly Pegasus: Bellerophon ---
Now I hear I think
This one blames You must've pinched
I pinched?
My flank,
And that one blames. Somehow pinched me, I pinched?
They each make claims and, And I flinched. You bucked.
Counter-claims. Flinched.
They seize upon the incident,
Look for implications.
When it was only Zeus again
Venting his frustrations.
I didn't throw you. You threw me.
You lie! You lie!
Why this?
Pegasus
Why this? That's my name. We broke in two.
Broke in two.
After such a friendship? -All because of you-
After such a bond, -All because of you-
A fusing.
Why this? Pegasus, just say it's
True,
Say it's true
More than a friendship -I say it was you,-
More than a bond. -I say it was you.-
--- Unknown ---
Rider and the horse in flight You and I we still
Could go:
No, we won't,
We'll never go.
Welded to the other tight.
Say it, say it, say it
Will be so.
Never will be so.
--- All ---
Higher, higher, and never too high,
And never enough.
--- Bellerophon ---
Olympians, please make this pox be gone.
--- All ---
Or must winged Pegasus and
Downward-bounce Bellerophon
Go on?
--- Gadfly ---
That's it.
