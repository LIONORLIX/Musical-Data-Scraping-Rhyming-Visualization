------ At The Sounding ------
--- Unknown ---
At the sounding of the trumpet,
When the saints are gathered home,
We will greet each other by the crystal sea.
With the friends and all the loved ones
There awaiting us to come,
What a gathering of the faithful that will be!
What a gathering, gathering it will be
At the sounding of the glorious jubilee!
What a gathering, gathering it will be!
What a gathering of the faithful that will be!
At the sounding of the trumpet,
When the saints are gathered home,
When the golden harps are sounding,
And the angel bands proclaim,
