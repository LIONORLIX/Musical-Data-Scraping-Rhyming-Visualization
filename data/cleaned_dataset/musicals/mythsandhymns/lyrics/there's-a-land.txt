------ There's A Land ------
--- Unknown ---
There's a land of pure delight
Where saints immortal reign.
Eternal day excludes the night
And pleasures banish pain.
There, everlasting spring abides
And never withering floers.
Death, like a narrow sea, divides
This heavenly land from ours.
--- Unknown ---
But a little divide,
But a narrow sea.
There is a land
Awaiting me
But a blink beyond our worldly care
On joyful wing I'll travel there.
