------ Awaiting You ------
--- Unknown ---
Shining in the eyes of every child,
And in the flame of dawn reflecting on the open sea.
In every fury and every love,
You are awaiting me.
--- Unknown ---
But what about the child who cannot breathe,
Or the gentle sage who won't see the age of thirty-two?
I am awaiting,
I am awaiting you.
--- Unknown ---
Light it all and burn it to the ground!
Go ahead and let your thunder sound!
Let me watch my loves and my teachers slowly fade away.
I'll just have to wait another day.
--- Unknown ---
Maybe in God we trust just a lucky charm,
Maybe faith is only hoping that we can rise anew.
And so I rise and so I stand.
I am awaiting you, oh,
I will still be standing here awaiting you.
--- Unknown ---
Light it all and burn it to the ground!
Go ahead and let your thunder sound!
Let me watch my loves and my teachers slowly fade away.
I'll just have to wait another day.
--- Unknown ---
And so I rise and so I stand.
I am awaiting,
I am awaiting you.
Awaiting you, oh,
I will still be standing here awaiting you.
