------ Hero And Leander ------
--- Unknown ---
Could I be Leander?
On a wave am I borne?
Borne to a new home across this lonely sea?
--- Unknown ---
Could you be my Hero, heart afire?
My lighthouse on the shoreline-
Could you be that to me?
--- Unknown ---
Oh, I need you-
I need the rise and fall of your voice.
Oh, I love you,
And now I have a love to rejoice.
--- Unknown ---
Hero and Leander, how your passion is brave.
Even if I drown here inside this wave,
My lighthouse on the shoreline,
My passion on this lonely sea,
