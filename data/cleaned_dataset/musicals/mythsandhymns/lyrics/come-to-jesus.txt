------ Come To Jesus ------
--- Emily ---
Dearest Matthew,
I am writing you from the waiting room. I'm next.
Doctor Mujit says I'll barely feel a thing- ninety seconds.
There's a vintage ad for jello on the wall. Real quaint.
I know we'd laugh if you were here in spite of everything.
Oh Matthew, let's not let this tear us apart.
I believe this little soul will cradle;
cradle in heaven until the day we can accept him together. Together.
For you and for me and for the child, I pray.

Come to Jesus
Come to Jesus
Come to Jesus just now
Just now come to Jesus
Come to Jesus just now
--- Unknown ---
He will save you
He will save you
He will save you just now
Just now He will save you
He will save you just now
--- Unknown ---
Oh, believe Him
He is able
He is willing
He'll receive you
Flee to Jesus
Call unto Him
--- Matthew ---
Dear Emily,
I write from the airport. Going away for a while.
I couldn't love you like you wanted, but I did love you. I do.
It's just that after what has happened something's ruined.
You feel it too, dying, and I can't look anymore.
To love its to be accompanied, guided by an angel.
But I've driven it away. And we are alone now. Maybe you're right:Maybe
that soul will cradle in heaven, and will come to you one day.
For that and for forgiveness I ray.
