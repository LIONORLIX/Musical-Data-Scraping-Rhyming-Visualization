------ Nelly was a Lady ------
--- Unknown ---
Down on the Mississippi floating,
Long time I travel on the way.
All night the cottonwood a-toting,
Sing for my true love all the day.
--- Unknown ---
Now I’m unhappy, and I’m weeping,
Can’t tote the cottonwood no more;
Last night, while Nelly was a-sleeping,
Death came a-knocking at the door.
--- Unknown ---
Nelly was a lady.
Last night, she died.
Toll the bell for lovely Nell,
My dark Virginny bride.
--- Unknown ---
When I saw my Nelly in the morning,
Smile till she opened up her eyes,
Seemed like the light of day a-dawning,
Just ‘fore the sun begin to rise.
--- Unknown ---
Down in the meadow, ‘mong the clover,
Walk with my Nelly by my side;
Now all them happy days are over,
Farewell, my dark Virginny bride.
--- Unknown ---
Nelly was a lady.
Last night, she died.
Toll the bell for lovely Nell,
My dark Virginny bride.
