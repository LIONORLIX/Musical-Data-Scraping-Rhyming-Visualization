------ Ring, Ring de Banjo ------
--- Unknown ---
(Verse 1)
De time is nebber dreary
If de darkey nebber groans
De ladies nebber weary
Wid de rattle ob de bones
Den come again Susanna
By de gaslight ob de moon
We'll tum de old Piano
When de banjo's out of tune
--- Unknown ---
(Chorus)
Ring, ring de banjo!
I like dat good old song
Come again, my true lub
Oh, what you been so long?
--- Unknown ---
(Verse 2)
Oh nebber count de bubbles
While dere's water in de spring
De darkey hab no troubles
While he's got dis song to sing
De beauties ob creation
Will nebber lose der charm
While I roam de old plantation
Wid my true lub on my arm
Ring, ring de banjo!
I like dat good old song
Come again, my true lub
Oh, what you been so long?
--- Unknown ---
(Verse 3)
Once I was so lucky
My massa set me free
I went to old Kentucky
To see what I could see
I could not go no farder
I turn to massa's door
I lub him all de harder
I'll go away no more
--- Unknown ---
(Chorus)
Ring, ring de banjo!
I like dat good old song
Come again, my true lub
Oh, what you been so long?
--- Unknown ---
(Verse 4)
Early in de morning
Ob a lubly summer day
My massa send me warning
He'd like to hear me play
On de banjo tapping
I come wid dulcem strain
Massa fall a-napping
He'll nebber wake again
Ring, ring de banjo!
I like dat good old song
Come again, my true lub
Oh, what you been so long?
--- Unknown ---
(Verse 5)
My lub, I'll hab to leabe you
While de ribber's running high
But I nebber can deceibe you
So don't you wipe your eye
I's guine to make some money
But I'll come anodder day
I'll come again my honey
If I have to work my way
--- Unknown ---
(Chorus)
Ring, ring de banjo!
I like dat good old song
Come again, my true lub
Oh, what you been so long?
