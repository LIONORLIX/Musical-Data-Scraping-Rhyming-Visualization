------ Ah! May the Red Rose Live Alway! ------
--- Unknown ---
Ah! May the red rose live alway
To smile upon the earth and sky
Why should the beautiful ever weep?
Why should the beautiful die?
--- Unknown ---
Lending a charm to every ray
That falls on her cheeks of light
Giving the zephyr kiss for kiss
And nursing the dewdrop bright
--- Unknown ---
Ah! May the red rose live alway
To smile upon the earth and sky
Why should the beautiful ever weep?
Why should the beautiful die?
--- Unknown ---
Long may the daisies dance the field
Frolicking far and near
Why should the innocent hide their heads?
Why should the innocent fear?
--- Unknown ---
Spreading their petals in mute delight
When morn in its radiance breaks
Keeping a floral festival
Till the night-loving primrose wakes
--- Unknown ---
Long may the daisies dance the field
Frolicking far and near
Why should the innocent hide their heads?
Why should the innocent fear?
Lulled be the dirge in the cypress bough
That tells of departed flowers
Ah! that the butterfly's gilded wing
Fluttered in evergreen bowers!
--- Unknown ---
Sad is my heart for the blighted plants
Its pleasures are aye as brief
They bloom at the young yearâ€™s joyful call
And fade with the autumn leaf
--- Unknown ---
Ah! May the red rose live alway
To smile upon the earth and sky
Why should the beautiful ever weep?
Why should the beautiful die?
