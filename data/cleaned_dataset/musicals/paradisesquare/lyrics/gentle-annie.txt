------ Gentle Annie ------
--- Unknown ---
(Verse 1)
Thou wilt come no more, gentle Annie
Like a flower thy spirit did depart;
Thou are gone, alas! like the many
That have bloomed in the summer of my heart
--- Unknown ---
(Chorus)
Shall we never more behold thee;
Never hear thy winning voice again
When the Spring time comes, gentle Annie
When the wild flowers are scattered o’er the plain?
--- Unknown ---
(Verse 2)
We have roamed and loved mid the bowers
When thy downy cheeks were in their bloom;
Now I stand alone mid the flowers
While they mingle their perfumes o’er thy tomb
--- Unknown ---
(Chorus)
Shall we never more behold thee;
Never hear thy winning voice again
When the Spring time comes, gentle Annie
When the wild flowers are scattered o’er the plain?
--- Unknown ---
(Verse 3)
Ah! the hours grow sad while I ponder
Near the silent spot where thou are laid
And my heart bows down when I wander
By the streams and the meadows were we strayed
Shall we never more behold thee;
Never hear thy winning voice again
When the Spring time comes, gentle Annie
When the wild flowers are scattered o’er the plain?
