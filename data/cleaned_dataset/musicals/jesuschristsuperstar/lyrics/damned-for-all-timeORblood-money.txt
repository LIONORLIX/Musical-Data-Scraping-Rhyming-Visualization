------ Damned For All Time/Blood Money ------

--- Unknown ---
Now if I help you, it matters that you see
These sordid kinda things are coming hard to me.
It's taken me some time to work out what to do.
I weighed the whole thing out before I came to you.
I have no thought at all about my own reward.
I really didn't come here of my own accord.
Just don't say I'm ... damned for all time.
I came because I had to; I'm the one who saw.
Jesus can't control it like he did before.
And furthermore I know that Jesus thinks so too.
Jesus wouldn't mind that I was here with you.
I have no thought at all about my own reward.
I really didn't come here of my own accord.
Just don't say I'm ... damned for all time.
Annas, you're a friend, a worldly man and wise.
Caiaphas, my friend, I know you sympathise.
Why are we the prophets? Why are we the ones
Who see the sad solution - know what must be done?
I have no thought at all about my own reward.
I really didn't come here of my own accord.
Just don't say I'm damned for all time.

Cut the protesting, forget the excuses.
We want information. Get up of the floor.
--- CAIAPHAS ---
--- Unknown ---
We have the papers we need to arrest him.
You know his movements. We know the law.
--- ANNAS ---
--- Unknown ---
Your help in this matter won't go unrewarded.
--- CAIAPHAS ---
--- Unknown ---
We'll pay you in silver, cash on the nail.
We just need to know where the soldiers can find him.
--- ANNAS ---
--- Unknown ---
With no crowd around him.
--- CAIAPHAS ---
--- Unknown ---
Then we can't fail.
--- JUDAS ---
--- Unknown ---
I don't want your blood money!
--- CAIAPHAS ---

Oh, that doesn't matter, our expenses are good.
--- JUDAS ---

I don't need your blood money!
--- ANNAS ---
--- Unknown ---
But you might as well take it. We think that you should.
--- CAIAPHAS ---
--- Unknown ---
Think of the things you could do with that money,
Choose any charity - give to the poor.
We've noted your motives.
We've noted your feelings.
This isn't blood money - it's a ...
--- ANNAS ---
--- Unknown ---
A fee.
--- CAIAPHAS ---
--- Unknown ---
A fee nothing more.
--- JUDAS ---

On Thursday night you'll find him where you want him.
Far from the crowds, in the Garden of Gethsemane.
