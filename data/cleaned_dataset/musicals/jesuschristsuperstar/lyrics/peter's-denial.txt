------ Peter's Denial ------
--- MAID BY THE FIRE ---
--- Unknown ---
I think I've seen you somewhere.
I remember.
You were with that man they took away.
I recognize your face.
--- PETER ---
--- Unknown ---
You've got the wrong man lady.
I don't know him,
And I wasn't where he was tonight
Never near the place.
--- SOLDIER ---
--- Unknown ---
That's strange, for I am sure I saw you with with him.
You were right by his side, and yet you denied.
--- PETER ---
--- Unknown ---
I tell you I was never with him.
--- OLD MAN ---
--- Unknown ---
But I saw you too.
He looked just like you.
--- PETER ---
--- Unknown ---
I don't know him!
--- MARY MAGDALENE ---
--- Unknown ---
Peter, don't you know what you have said.
You've gone and cut him dead.
--- PETER ---
--- Unknown ---
I had to do it, don't you see?
Or else they'd go for me.
--- MARY MAGDALENE ---
--- Unknown ---
It's what he told us you would do.
