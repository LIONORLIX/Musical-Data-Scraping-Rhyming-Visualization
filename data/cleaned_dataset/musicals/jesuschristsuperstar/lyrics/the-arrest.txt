Tell me Christ how you feel tonight.
Do you plan to put up a fight?
Do you feel that you've had the breaks?
What would you say were your big mistakes?
Do you think that you may retire?
Did you think you would get much higher?
How do you view your coming trial?
Have your men proved at all worth while?
Come with us to see Caiaphas.
You'll just love the High Priest's house.
You'll just love seeing Caiaphas.
You'll just die in the High Priest's house.
Come on God this is not like you.
Let us know what you're going to do.
You know what you're supporters feel;
You'll escape in the final reel.
Tell me Christ how you feel tonight.
Do you plan to put up a fight?
Do you feel that you've had the breaks?
What would you say were your big mistakes?
Come with us to see Caiaphas.
You'll just love the High Priest's house.
You'll just love seeing Caiaphas.
You'll just die in the High Priest's house.
