Blowin’ like it’s gonna sweep my world away
I’m gonna stop in Carbondale and keep on going
That Duquesne train gonna ride me night and day

You say I’m a gambler, you say I’m a pimp
But I ain’t neither one

Sound like it’s on a final run

Blue light blinking, red light glowin’
Blowin’ like she’s at my chamber door
--- Unknown ---
You smiling through the fence at me
Just like you always smiled before

Blowin’ like she ain’t gonna blow no more

Can’t you hear that Duquesne whistle blowin’
Blowin’ like the sky’s gonna blow apart

You’re like a time bomb in my heart

I can hear a sweet voice gently calling
Must be the Mother of our Lord

I wake up every morning with that woman in my bed
Everybody telling me she’s gone to my head

Can’t you hear that Duquesne whistle blowin’
Blowin’ through another no-good town
The lights of my native land are glowin’
I wonder if they’ll know me next time around
--- Unknown ---
I wonder if that old oak tree’s still standing
That old oak tree, the one we used to climb
--- Unknown ---
Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowin’
Blowin’ like she’s blowin’ right on time
