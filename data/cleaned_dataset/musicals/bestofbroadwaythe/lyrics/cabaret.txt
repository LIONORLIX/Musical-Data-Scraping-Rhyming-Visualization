------ Cabaret ------
--- Musical "Cabaret" ---
--- Unknown ---
What good is sitting alone in your room?
Come hear the music play.
Life is a Cabaret, old chum,
Come to the Cabaret.
--- Unknown ---
Put down the knitting,
The book and the broom.
Time for a holiday.
Life is Cabaret, old chum,
Come to the Cabaret.
--- Unknown ---
Come taste the wine,
Come hear the band.
Come blow your horn,
Start celebrating;
Right this way,
Your table's waiting
--- Unknown ---
No use permitting
soem prophet of doom
To wipe every smile away.
Come hear the music play.
Life is a Cabaret, old chum,
Come to the Cabaret!
--- Unknown ---
I used to have a girlfriend
known as Elsie
With whom I shared
Four sordid rooms in Chelsea
--- Unknown ---
She wasn't what you'd call
A blushing flower...
As a matter of fact
She rented by the hour.
--- Unknown ---
The day she died the neighbors
came to snicker:
Well, thats what comes
from to much pills and liquor.
--- Unknown ---
But when I saw her laid out like a Queen
She was the happiest...corpse...
I'd ever seen.
--- Unknown ---
I think of Elsie to this very day.
I'd remember how'd she turn to me and say:
What good is sitting alone in your room?
Come hear the music play.
Life is a Cabaret, old chum,
Come to the Cabaret.
--- Unknown ---
And as for me,
I made up my mind back in Chelsea,
When I go, I'm going like Elsie.
--- Unknown ---
Start by admitting
From cradle to tomb
Isn't that long a stay.
Life is a Cabaret, old chum,
Only a Cabaret, old chum,
