------ Swanee ------
--- Al Jolson ---
--- Unknown ---
I've been away from you along time
I never thought I'd miss 'ya so
Somehow I feel, your love is real
Near you I wanna be.
--- Unknown ---
The Birds are singing it is songtime
The banjos strumming soft and low
I know that you yearn for me to swanee you're calling me
--- Unknown ---
Chorus
Swanee - how I love ya, how I love ya
My dear old swanee.
I'd give the world to be among the folks in D-I-X-I-E-ven though my mammy's waiting for me,
praying for me down by the swanne.
The folks up north will see me no more when I get to that swanee shore
--- Unknown ---
(he whistles like a bird)
--- Unknown ---
I love the old folks at home
Swanee - how I love ya, how I love ya
My dear old swanee. I'd give the world to be among the
folks in D-I-X-I-E-ven though my mammy's waiting for
me, praying for me down by the swanee.
