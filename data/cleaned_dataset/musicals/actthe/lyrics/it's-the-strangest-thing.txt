------ It's The Strangest Thing ------
--- Unknown ---
I'll have my back to the door
I'll be standing with my back to the door,
yet I'll know when he walks in
It's the strangest thing
I'll hear the laugh of the crowd,
though standing well apart from the crowd
And I'll know when he walks in
It's the strangest thing
What do you suppose it is
that's mine and his
What would you call that?
I would call it something mystical
if I believed in all that
Just the same
I know when I enter a room,
from the moment I enter the room,
if it's some room he's been in
It's the strangest thing
What do you suppose it is
that's mine and his
What would you call that?
I would call it something magical
if I believed in all that
Just the same
When I hear the telephone ring,
as I hurry to answer the ring
If I know it's him, it's him
It's the strangest thing
