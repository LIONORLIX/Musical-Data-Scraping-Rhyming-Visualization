------ Bobo's ------
--- Unknown ---
Outside of Town Hall
There's a small piano bar
Where a neon sign
Keeps flashin', Bobo's
--- Unknown ---
Jessie plays a Yamaha
Underneath the mirrored star
And that neon sign
Keeps flashin', Bobo's
--- Unknown ---
Oh, Bobo's not around today
But still it's Bobo's anyway
He left that stipulation
In his will
--- Unknown ---
And when you look around, it's clear
All us steadies love it here
At Bobo's
Bar and Grill
--- Unknown ---
Look at Mr. Miller
Shootin' pool with Bobby
Bankin' off the corners
We love that sound
--- Unknown ---
Look at Peg and Mabel
Winkin' from a table
Waitin' for a sucker
To buy a round
--- Unknown ---
Look at Mr. Johnson
From the fillin' station
Pouring out his troubles
To Ruth McGore
--- Unknown ---
Jacoby McGuire
Talks about the fire
He caught a drifter settin'
At the Pac N' Store
--- Unknown ---
Ha ha ha, ha ha ha, woo
Tell your story honey
--- Unknown ---
Bobo's
Well the swells
Down in Fair Acres
Would never care to
Venture near it,
Bobo's
--- Unknown ---
So noisy that a heart could break
But a bug could never hear it
Bobo's
--- Unknown ---
Ford's and Chevy's backin' up
Hey, don't smack my pickup truck
And that neon sign
Keeps flashin', Bobo's
--- Unknown ---
Coffee for a dime a cup
Pecan pie, a half a buck
While that neon sign
Keeps flashin', Bobo's
--- Unknown ---
So if you wanna run and hide
From what's not happening outside
The atmosphere at Bobo's fills the bill
--- Unknown ---
Yeah, yeah, woo
--- Unknown ---
Come on inside and have a beer
Spend the happy hour here
At Bobo's
Bar and Grill
--- Unknown ---
Look at Mr. Bradley
Hockin' his insurance
Not a sole's listenin'
They never do
--- Unknown ---
Sammy full of Bud now
Rythym in his what now
Sings another chorus of
Babaloo
Go Sammy, baby!
--- Unknown ---
Ha ha ha ha
--- Unknown ---
Bobo's
When all the pain of failin'
Gets so bad
You think you'll never shake it
Bobo's
--- Unknown ---
I lost my job
My kid is sick
Jesus, God, how can I take it?
Bobo's
--- Unknown ---
The laughters much too loud
To let you think of how
You'll never make it
You'll never make it
You'll never make it!
