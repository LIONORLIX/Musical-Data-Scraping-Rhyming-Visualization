------ There When I Need Him ------
--- Unknown ---
There when I need him
There when I need him
That's all that matters
There when I'm fed up
Holding my head up
When everything shatters
--- Unknown ---
Someone to lean on
Really rely on
A shoulder to cry on
No muscled Adonis
With vine leaves in his hair
But there when I need him
There
--- Unknown ---
To determine what I've left
Is Juno all alone?
If the sole communication
Was by mail or telephone
--- Unknown ---
Delilah might have been
No friend of Sam's
If he always had
To send her telegrams
--- Unknown ---
The workable relationship
Must be with someone you can
Touch, and hold, and see
And so I found
The perfect man for me
--- Unknown ---
For, he is there when I need him
There when I need him
That's all that matters
There
--- Unknown ---
Someone to lean on
Really rely on
A shoulder to cry on
No muscled Adonis
With vine leaves in his hair
--- Unknown ---
But, love when I need him
Love when I need him
Love when I need him
