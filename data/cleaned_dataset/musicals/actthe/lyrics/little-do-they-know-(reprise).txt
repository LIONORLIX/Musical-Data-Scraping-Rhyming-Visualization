------ Little Do They Know (Reprise) ------
--- Chorus ---
So the star needs a stage
To change her clothes
And the natives are restless
Their anxiety shows
--- He ---
And their hostile posture
Seems to say
--- She ---
When will she be back?
--- He ---
Who the hell are they?
--- Chorus ---
But the knowledgable gypsy knows
It's ridiculous to throw a fit
That's the way things are
When they pay to see a star
--- He ---
But...
--- Chorus ---
Little do they know
And little do they see
Without us paying court
Without us in support
How lousy she might be
--- She ---
When we go...
[Music plays]
--- He ---
They don't even stir
--- Chorus ---
When we go...
[Music plays]
--- Chorus ---
They only look at her
--- Girls ---
Such inequality
--- Men ---
Little do they know
--- Girls ---
Ooh-wah, ooh-wah
--- Men ---
That we are even there
--- Girls ---
Ooh-wah, ooh-wah
--- Chorus ---
Yes, that's the gypsy's curse
And what is even worse
Little do they care
--- Men ---
Mornings at the bar
--- Women ---
Mornings at the bar
--- Men ---
Sweating through the class
--- Girls ---
Sweating through the class
--- Girl #1 ---
Yet she's the one they spot
--- Girl #2 ---
No matter what you got
--- Girl #3 ---
On how you posturesque
--- Chorus ---
If the like...
[Music plays]
--- Chorus ---
We didn't hear the proof
Yet she goes...
[music plays]
--- Chorus ---
And hear them raise the roof
Talk about equity
Gotta have a dream
--- Girls ---
Ah ah ah ah
--- Men ---
That isn't mine alone
--- Girls ---
Ah ah ah
--- Chorus ---
Each gypsy that you see
Is just the same as me
The fact is why we know
Someday I'll go so far
That I'll become a star
