------ My Own Space ------
--- Unknown ---
I won't need much
Just my own space
A little time
With my own thoughts
And my own space
--- Unknown ---
Some place to run
Some place to hide
Where there is no one else
But me, to meet inside
--- Unknown ---
I love you more
Than I can ever say
I love you more, and more, and more
With every passing day
--- Unknown ---
Allow me light
A breath of air
Leave me the only thing
I own, we cannot share
--- Unknown ---
Just leave me that
Sweet love of mine
Just leave me that
Just my own space
And we'll be fine
--- Unknown ---
I love you more
Than I could ever say
I love you more, and more, and more
With every passing day
--- Unknown ---
Allow me light
A breath of air
Leave me the only thing
I own, we cannot share
--- Unknown ---
Just my own space
Sweet love of mine
Just leave me that
Just my own space
