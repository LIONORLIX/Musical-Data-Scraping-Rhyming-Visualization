My name is Mandy
Mandy Child Patinkin
and I've been thinkin
that I might be known more -
as a male Chanteuse
--- Unknown ---
So if you like my 20 songs on CD
you should come and see me
every night
Dressing casual and loose
AND TURNING ON THE JUICE....
while emoting like a goo-oose
--- Unknown ---
Somewhat Overindulgent
Like I'm high,
I in-terpret a lyr-ic
like - I'm about - to die.

Somewhat Overindulgent
I sing blue
and you won't recognize the tune -
after I get through.
--- Unknown ---
Someday I'll do a one-man show
and sing Jolson songs like Ole Black Joe
and Matamee.
--- Unknown ---
I'll emphasize most every word
and twitter like a little bird
to prove I'M HAMMY.
--- Unknown ---
SOMEWHAT OVERINDULGENT -
watch me cry (Are you watchin' me cry, mama?)
Barbra did in Yentl
Why then, oh why, can't I?
--- Unknown ---
If Barbra Streisand gets to be -
Beyond Indulgent
