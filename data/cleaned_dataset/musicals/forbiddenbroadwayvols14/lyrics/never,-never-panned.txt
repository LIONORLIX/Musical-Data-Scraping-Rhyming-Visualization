------ Never, Never Panned ------
--- Unknown ---
My name is Mary Martin
And as Peter Pan I'm grand
Some critics hesitate
But always think I'm great
I'm never never panned
--- Unknown ---
To be a critic's darling
Sing impeccably, but bland
Just keep an open throat
And then scoop on every note
You're never never panned
You'll win a Tony if you're coy-like
More precious far than gold
And if you dress up boy-like
Your auto-bio's pre-sold
--- Unknown ---
So come with me where critics rave
And meanies understand
You too can be a star
Like my son who plays J.R. on Ellis
We're never never panned!
