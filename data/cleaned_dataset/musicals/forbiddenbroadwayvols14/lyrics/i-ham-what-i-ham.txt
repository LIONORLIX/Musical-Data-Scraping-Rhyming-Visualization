------ I Ham What I Ham ------
--- Unknown ---
And now... presenting the Tony Award-winning star of La Cage Au Falles, Mr. George Hearn!
--- Unknown ---
GEORGE: I ham what I ham
And when I ham, I get ovations
Though I make a guy dressing in drag
Vent my frustrations
It's my chance to dress myself
In pearls and Herman
My chance to become the world's next Ethel Merman
In pants I am a lamb
But in a dress --
Hey world, I ham what I ham!
--- Unknown ---
I ham what I ham
And when I ham
I am a phony
Who cares if I swish
It's worth a dish to win a Tony!
It's MY PART!
So I'll rant and rave like Mussolini
So what if I play it like a queenie sweetie?
This wig is a sham
Likewise, I am
That's why I ham what I ham!
