------ Hey, Bob Fosse ------
--- Unknown ---
The minute we walk on the stage
You can tell we have a style of distinction
A good director
Bob Fosse, you're our guy
--- Unknown ---
Say wouldn't you like to know what's going on in my thigh
Your dances get right to the point
And although they've got that razzle-dazzle look
--- Unknown ---
Hey Bob Fosse
Spend a little time on the book
--- Unknown ---
(Each singer keeps repeating the last word of the line)
--- Unknown ---
Don't you want a good plot?
Don't you care about laughs?
You forgot them in
--- Unknown ---
Plot
Laughs
Big deal!

Plot
Laughs
Big deal!
--- Unknown ---
Plot, laughs, big deal
--- Unknown ---
(Spoken) Yeah, the lights are cool, but how about turning them on so we can see the -- Plot
All those sexy bods, but we're ready for some -- Laughs
Why don't you use an original score that has something to do with the -- Story
--- Unknown ---
You got something against Italians, son?
--- Unknown ---
Instead of Sweet Charity, let's revive -- Damn Yankees!
--- Unknown ---
(Sung) And forget about -- big deal
--- Unknown ---
The minute we walk on the stage
You start changing lights
And raising smokescreens
And spinning scenery
So clever, so refined
But everything's so wild you'll leave the actor behind!
--- Unknown ---
The story gets way off the point
And you have to do a rewrite, hook, or crook!
Hey Bob Fosse!
Hey Bob Fosse!
Hey Bob Fosse!
--- Unknown ---
Spend a little time on the book!
--- Unknown ---
Plot, laughs, story
Plot, laughs, story
Plot, laughs, story
--- Unknown ---
How's about it Bobby?
Yeah
