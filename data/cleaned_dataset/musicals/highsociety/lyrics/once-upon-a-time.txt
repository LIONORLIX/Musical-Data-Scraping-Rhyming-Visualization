------ Once upon a Time ------
--- Unknown ---
Once upon a time,
Or so the story goes,
There lived a little well-read girl just perfect I suppose,
Lucky little princess in her hand-embroidered dress,
Called out Am I a princess?
And the whole world answered Yes
--- Unknown ---
See how well she rides,
See how boys adore her,
Who would not rush to turn the tides and stop the planets for her,
No wonder she grew up believing she was utterly sublime,
But that was once upon a time.
--- Unknown ---
Life was so much fun,
Love was better still,
But fairytales don't seem to end the way you think they will,
Happily ever after isn't as it looks,
For happily ever after is for princesses in books.
--- Unknown ---
All at once the air,
Feels a little colder,
As if the world had turned it's back and somehow no-one told her,
In fact until she was this morning life was absolutely prime,
