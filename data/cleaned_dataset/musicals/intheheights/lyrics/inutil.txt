------ Inutil ------
--- KEVIN ---
This isn't happening
Inutil.
Useless.
Just like my father was before me
Inutil.
Useless.
And everyday he cut the cane
He came home late and prayed for rain, prayed for rain
And on those days when nothing came
My father's face was lined with shame
He'd sit me down beside him and he'd say,
My father was a farmer,
His father was a farmer,
And you will be a farmer.
But I told him,
Papi, I'm sorry, I'm going farther.
I'm getting on a plane
And I'm gonna change the world someday.
And he slapped my face
He stood there, staring at me
Useless.
Today my daughter's home and I am
Useless
And as a baby she amazed me with the things she learned each day
She used to stay on the fire escape while all the other kids would play
And I would stand beside her and I'd say,
I'm proud to be your father
Cuz you worked so much harder
And you are so much smarter
Then I was at your age.
And I always knew
That she would fly away
That she was gonna change the world someday
I will not be the reason that my family can't succeed
I will do what it takes
They'll have everything they need
Or all my work, all my life
