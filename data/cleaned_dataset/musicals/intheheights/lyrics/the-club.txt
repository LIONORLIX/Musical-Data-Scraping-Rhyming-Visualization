Relax? Que relax? I'm relaxed.

Wepa Vanessa!
--- USNAVI ---
So you've been here before
I don't go out I get so busy with the store
Y cada dia it's a brand new chore
My arms are sore
No time for the dance floor
But maybe you and me should hang out some more
I'm such a dork, but I-

Vanessa, let me get the next one
Vanessa, let me interject some
The way you sweat, the way you flex on the floor it makes me want you more
Vanessa, let me get the next one
Vanessa, let me interject some

Bartender!
Let me get an Armaretto Sour
For this ghetto flower
How are you so pretty?
You complete me
You had me at hello,you know you need me
Truly, madly, deeply, let's get freaky
Oh I get it you're the strong and silent type
Well, I'm the Caribbean Island type
And I can drive you wild all night
But I digress
Say something so I don't stress
