------ When You're Home ------
--- NINA ---
I used to think we lived at the top of the world
When the world was just a subway map
And the 1 slash 9 climbed a dotted line to my place
--- BENNY ---
There's no 9 train now
--- NINA ---
Right
I used to think the Bronx was a place in the sky
When the world was just a subway map
And my thoughts took shape
--- Unknown ---
NINA/BENNY
On that fire escape
--- NINA ---
Can you remind me of what it was like
At the top of the world?
--- BENNY ---
Come with me
We begin July with a stop at my corner fire hydrant
--- NINA ---
You would open it every summer
--- BENNY ---
I would bust it with a wrench till my face got drenched
Till I heard the sirens
Then I ran like hell
--- NINA ---
You ran like hell
--- BENNY ---
Yeah I ran like hell
--- NINA ---
I remember well
--- BENNY ---
To your father's dispatch window,
Hey, let me in, yo
They're coming to get me!
--- NINA ---
You were always in constant trouble-
--- BENNY ---
Then your dad would act all snide
But he let me hide
You'd be there inside
--- NINA ---
Life was easier then
--- BENNY ---
Nina, everything is easier when you're home
The street's a little kinder
When you're home
Can't you see
That the day seems clearer
Now that you are here or is it me
Maybe it's just me
We gotta go I gotta show you all I know
The sun is setting and the light is getting low
--- NINA ---
Are we going to Castle Garden?
--- BENNY ---
Maybe, maybe not, but way to take a shot, when the day is hot
I got a perfect shady spot a little ways away that oughta cool us down
--- NINA ---
Cool us down-
--- BENNY ---
Welcome back to town
--- NINA ---
Now, back in high school when it darkened
You'd hang out in Bennett Park and
--- BENNY ---
Usnavi would bring his radio...
--- NINA ---
As I walked home from Senior Studies
I'd see you rapping with your buddies
--- BENNY ---
With the volume high
--- NINA ---
I walked on by
--- BENNY ---
You walked on by-
--- RAPPERS ---
No pare, sigue sigue! (x7)
--- Unknown ---
BENNY/COMMUNITY
When you're home
--- BENNY ---
Oh, the summer night are cooler
--- Unknown ---
BENNY/COMMUNITY
When you're home
--- NINA ---
Now that you're here with me
--- BENNY ---
And that song you're hearing is the neighborhood just cheering you along
--- NINA ---
Don't say that
--- BENNY ---
What's wrong?
--- NINA ---
Don't say that!
When I was younger I'd imagine what would happen if my parents had stayed in Puerto Rico
Who would I be if I had never seen Manhattan
If I lived in Puerto Rico with my people?
My people...
I feel like all my life I've tried to find the answer
Working harder, learning Spanish, learning all I can
I thought I might find the answers out at Stanford
But I'd stare out at the sea
Thinking, Where am I supposed to be?
So please don't say you're proud of me, when I've lost my way
--- BENNY ---
Then can I say:
I couldn't get my mind off you all day
Now listen to me
That may be how you perceive it
But Nina please believe that when you find your way again
You're gonna change the world and then
We're all gonna brag and say
We knew her when
This was your home
--- NINA ---
I'm home-
--- BENNY ---
Welcome home-
--- NINA ---
When you're here with me-
--- BENNY ---
Welcome home-
--- NINA ---
I used to think we lived at the top of the world
--- BENNY ---
Welcome home-
--- NINA ---
I'm home-
--- Unknown ---
(at the same time)
BENNY
You're finally home-
You're home!
--- NINA ---
I'm home
I'm home
