This is my street
I smile at the faces I've known all my life
They regard me with pride
And everyone's sweet
They say, You're going places!
So how can I say that while I was away, I had so much to hide!
Hey guys, it's me!
The biggest disappointment you know
The kid couldn't hack it, she's back and she's walkin real slow
Welcome home
Just breathe

As the radio plays old forgotten boleros
I think of the days when this city was mine
I remember the praise
Ay, te adoro, te quiero
The neighborhood waved, and said
Nina, be brave, and you're gonna be fine
And maybe it's me,
But it all seems like lifetimes ago.
So what do I say to these faces that I used to know?
Hey, I'm home?

Mira, Nina

No me preocupo por ella

They're not worried about me

Mira, alli esta nuestra estrella

They are all counting on me to succeed
I am the one who made it out
The one who always made the grade
But maybe I should've just stayed home...
When I was a child I stayed wide awake, climbed to the highest place,
on every fire escape, restless to climb

I got every scholarship
Saved every dollar
The first to go to college
How do I tell them why
I'm coming back home
With my eyes on the horizon
Just me and the GWB,
Asking 'Gee Nina, what'll you be?'
Straighten the spine
Smile for the neighbors
Everything's fine
Everything's cool
The standard reply
Lots of tests, lots of papers
Smile, wave goodbye
And pray to the sky, Oh, God
And what will my parents say?
