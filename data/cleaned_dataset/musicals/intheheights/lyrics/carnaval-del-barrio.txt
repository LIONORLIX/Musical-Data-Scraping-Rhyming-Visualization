------ Carnaval del Barrio ------
--- DANIELA ---
Hey... Hey...
What's this tonteria that I'm seeing on the street?
I never thought I'd see the day...
Since when are Latin people scared of heat?
When i was a little girl
growing up in the hills of Vega Alta
my favorite time of year was Chrstmas time!
Ask me why!
--- CARLA ---
Why?
--- DANIELA ---
There wasn't an ounce of snow
But, oh, the coquito would flow
As we sang the aguinaldo
The carnaval would begin to grow!
Business is closed, and we're about to go...
Let's have a carnaval del barrio!

Lai le lo lai lo le lo lai
You can sing anything

Just so long as you sing

Yo!
Why is everyone so happy?
We are sweating and we have no power
I've gotta get out of here soon
This block's getting worse by the hour!
You can't even go to the club with a friend
Without having somebody shove you!
--- DANIELA ---
Ay, por favor
Vanessa don't pretend that Usnavi's your friend
We all know that he love you!
--- COMMUNITY ---
Ohhhh!!!

Wow,now that you mention that sexual tension, it's easy to see!

Yo, yo, yo y-y-yo-yo
Now, now, everyone gather 'round, sit down, listen,
I got an announcement
Wow, it involves large amounts, it's
Somewhere in the range of 96,000
Atencion, I'm closing shop
Sonny, grab everybody a soda pop!
Yo, grab a bottle, kiss it up to God,
Cuz Abuela Claudia just won the lotto!
Abuela Claudia won the lotto
We're bookin a flight for D.R. tomorrow

--- SONNY ---
Listen up, this is what ya'll want?
We close this bodega,
The neighborhood is gone!
They selling the dispatch,
They closing the salon
And they'll never turn the lights back on cuz-
--- WITH VANESSA ---
We are powerless,
We are powerless!
--- SONNY ---
But ya'll keep dancin' and singin' and celebratin'
But it's gettin' late and this place is disintegratin' and-
--- WITH VANESSA ---
We are powerless,
We are powerless!
--- USNAVI ---
Alright we are powerless, so light up a candle!
There's nothing going on here that we can't handle!
--- SONNY ---
You don't understand, I'm not trying to be funny!
--- USNAVI ---
We're gonna give a third of the money to you, Sonny!
--- SONNY ---
What?
--- USNAVI ---
Yeah, yeah...
--- SONNY ---
For real?
--- USNAVI ---
Yes!
Maybe you're right, Sonny.
Call in the coroners
Maybe we're powerless, a corner full of foreigners.
Maybe this neighborhood's changing forever
Maybe tonight is our last night together, however!
How do you wanna face it?
Do you wanna waste it, when the end is so close you can taste it?
Y'all could cry with your head in the sand
I'm a fly this flag that I got in my hand!
