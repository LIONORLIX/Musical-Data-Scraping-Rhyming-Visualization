------ I Love What I'm Doing ------
--- DOROTHY ---
You boys play
For the love of the game.
You get no pay,
And I'm just the same.
I have my fun
Though my funds are low,
But come what may,
I won't turn pro.
--- Unknown ---
I love what I'm doing
When I'm doing it for love,
The kick that I get is my reward.
If the lad is not a spender,
I'm inclined to be more tender,
And believe you me, I'm never bored.
I get more thrills spending my evenings
In a quiet spot for two
Than up in a penthouse high above.
If I had a palm that itches,
I could go from rags to riches,
But I love what I'm doing
When I'm doing it for love.
--- Unknown ---
I love what I'm doing
When I'm doing it for love,
I know ev'ry bench in Central Park.
If the lad who comes a-wooing
Wants to take me out canoeing,
It's the greatest thing since Noah's Ark.
And if a guy takes me out driving
And his motorcar breaks down,
I roll up my sleeves and help him shove.
But I'm really in my heyday
If he wants ten bucks till payday,
'Cause I love what I'm doing
