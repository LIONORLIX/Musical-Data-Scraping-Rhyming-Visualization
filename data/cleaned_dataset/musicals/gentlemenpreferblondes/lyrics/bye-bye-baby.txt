------ Bye Bye Baby ------
--- GUS ---
I'll be in my room alone
Ev'ry post-meridian.
--- LORELEI ---
And I'll be with my diary
And that book by Mr. Gideon.
--- GUS ---
Bye bye, baby,
Remember you're my baby
When they give you the eye.
Although I know that you care,
Won't you write and declare
That though on the loose,
You are still on the square.
I'll be gloomy,
But send that rainbow to me,
Then my shadows will fly.
Though you'll be gone for a while,
I know that I'll be smiling
With my baby, bye and bye,
With my baby, bye and bye.

Bye bye, baby,
Remember you're my baby
When they give you the eye.
Although I know that you care,
Won't you write and declare
That though on the loose,
You are still on the square.
I'll be gloomy,
But send that rainbow to me,
Then my shadows will fly.
Though you'll be gone for a while,
I know that I'll be smiling
With my baby, bye and bye,
Don't be a cry baby,
Just say bye bye, baby,
We'll be together
