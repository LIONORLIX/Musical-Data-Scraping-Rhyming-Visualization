------ Just A Kiss Apart ------
--- HENRY ---
While the violins play
In a little French cafe,
How near to me you are.
It's a timeworn cliche,
But I simply have to say:
So near and yet so far.
--- Unknown ---
We're just a kiss apart,
And yet we dance
On and on.
We're just a kiss apart,
But soon our chance
Will be gone.
Now you're beside my heart,
Your eyes have started
To shine.
Oh, but I know too well
Daybreak may break the spell,
So while we're just a kiss apart,
------ fin ------
