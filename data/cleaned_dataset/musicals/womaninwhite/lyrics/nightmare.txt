(Marian starts to toss and turn in her drugged sleep)
--- Tous (off) ---
The day is past and over:
All thanks, oh Lord to thee,
I pray thee now that sinless the hours of dark may be:
Though many are the perils through which I have to go
Oh Lord, keep me in thy sight
And guard me through the coming night.
--- Unknown ---
The holly and the ivy
When they are both full grown
Of all the trees that are in the wood,
The holly bears the crown
O the rising of the sun
--- Unknown ---
And the running of the deer
The playing of the merry organ,
--- Unknown ---
Sweet singing in the choir
Sweet singing in the choir
Sweet singing in the choir
Sing for it's Lammastide
Sing for it's Lammastide
Dance for who knows
--- Unknown ---
If we'll live till the spring
Dance for who knows
--- Unknown ---
If we'll live till the spring
--- Unknown ---
What will protect us? A doll made of corn.

During this, events become gothic and unreal we hear ironic echoes of the story so far - voices swirling and overlapping. Anne Catherick, Laura, Hartright,
Glyde and Fosco all appear to her as if in a dream
--- Anne ---
I can trust you.
--- Laura ---
So strange and yet so true
I see myself?
--- Marian ---
It's true.
--- Glyde ---
I will not stand for it? I will not.
--- Fosco ---
You'll be fine Lady Glyde.
--- Laura ---
I don't trust him or anyone.
--- Hartright ---
Are you happy now?
--- Marian ---
Laura, you know you can trust me.
--- Laura ---
Trust you, now why should I trust you?
--- Anne ---
You have betrayed me.
--- Glyde ---
Take her back to the asylum.
--- Fosco ---
You will not be harmed.
--- Laura ---
Marian wake up!
--- Anne ---
I'll haunt you.
--- Hartright ---
She had a secret she would tell.
--- Anne ---
I'll haunt you till you die.
--- Laura ---
Wake up, help me!
--- Hartright ---
Perhaps I'm not the only one
With secrets.
--- Fosco ---
I'm a doctor. Trust me.
--- Anne ---
They've come to lock me up. No, no!
--- Glyde ---
You must be confined.
--- Laura ---
Marian, what have they done to you?
--- Fosco ---
And I never lie.
--- Marian ---
I would wake and find her
Wake and find her
Find her?
