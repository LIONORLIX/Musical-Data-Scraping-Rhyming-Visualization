------ If I Could Only Dream This World Away ------
--- Unknown ---
If I could only dream this world away
I'd awake in your arms
If I could keep this bitter life at bay
Wide awake, in your arms
The vow that keeps me from you
I cannot undo
I'm lost
Lost in a fantasy that can't come true.
--- Unknown ---
If I could only dream this world away
I'd awake in your arms
I'd long to sleep forever
Dreaming of only you
I'm lost
How many nights like this
