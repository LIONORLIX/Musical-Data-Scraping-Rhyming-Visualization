------ Holly and the Ivy ------
--- CHORUS ---
--- Unknown ---
The Holly and the Ivy
When they are both full grown
Of all the trees that are in the wood
The Holly bears the crown
The holly bears a berry
As red as any blood
And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ
To do poor sinners good
--- Unknown ---
The holly bears a prickle
As sharp as any thorn
And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ
On Christmas Day in the morn
The holly bears a bark
As bitter as any gaul
And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ
For to redeem us all
--- VOICE ---
--- Unknown ---
NO!
--- CHORUS ---
--- Unknown ---
The Holly and the ivy
When they are both full grown
Of all the trees that are in the wood
The holly bears the crown
Oh the rising of the sun
And the running of the deer
The playing of the merry women
Sweet sleeping in the cloud
--- Unknown ---
Forever husband and wife
Dance of your life
Merrily Merrily
She is a source of pride in his arms
Pride in his arms
Merrily Merrily
--- Unknown ---
Time for Rejoice and Time for Bliss
Dance to the bridge and groom!
Cheers to the Bride and Groom!
Here's to the Bride and Groom!

Lady Laura Glyde
Lady Laura Glyde
The church bells are ringing
They call out to warn you
But even my warnings were too late to save you
Now your fate is sealed
How can he be stopped?
You'll be the lady of Black Water House
All the rooms filled with sorrow
The lake filled with tear drops
Where you're at his mercy and he knows no mercy
I can't let this come to pass
I can't let you suffer as I did
I must journey to your side
So, unlike me,
You won't be friendless
So, unlike me, you won't be friendless

Welcome to your new home Lady Glyde!

Laura you know you can trust me
Please let me know what is wrong
We seem so far apart and it breaks my heart!
--- LAURA ---
--- Unknown ---
Trust you? Now why should I trust you?
When your advice led me here
Straight from the wedding prayer to complete despair!
He only wants my money!
That's all he wants from me!
Though he's a barronet
He is steep in debt
I'll show you how he loves me!
I think you'd want to see
His love is on display
A mark for every day'
