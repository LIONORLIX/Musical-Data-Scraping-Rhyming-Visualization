------ Gift for Living Well ------
--- Unknown ---
Fosco:  No, no, no! Well, if you insist.
--- Unknown ---
Fosco:  I am a man
Of medicine
No opera star,
(with passion) My voice is thin
Though I play cards
And violin
At none of these do I excel.
--- Unknown ---
The talent that
I have in spades
Is one for fun
And escapades
A gift for living well
Attracted to the lively arts
Breaking bread, breaking hearts.
--- Unknown ---
(He looks at Marian)
--- Unknown ---
Making love, when love has me spellbound.
--- Unknown ---
(He takes some wine from a servant, fills his glass)
--- Unknown ---
Italian food
The wines of France
I never walk when I can dance
--- Unknown ---
(A small pirouhette for the ladies)
--- Unknown ---
A gift for living well
--- Unknown ---
A one man band
I sing the lead
Alwasy self-accompanied
--- Unknown ---
(He plays a few chords on the piano)
--- Unknown ---
I concede probably I'm hellbound
--- Unknown ---
A bon vivant
As you can see
A lust for life as big as me!
A gift for living well.
--- Unknown ---
Fosco: But enough about me! Raise your glasses
--- Unknown ---
(Fosco raises his glass to the bride and groom)
--- Unknown ---
Fosco: Sir Percival Glyde!
--- Unknown ---
All: (raising their glasses) Oh what a joyous occasion this is!
Sir Percival Glyde!
--- Unknown ---
Fosco: Dolce vita to you and your Mrs.!
--- Unknown ---
Glyde: This is the moment I've longed for.
--- Unknown ---
Marian: Everything's for the best now.
--- Unknown ---
Mr. Fairlie:  I'll have an empty nest now.
--- Unknown ---
All: And here's to the bride!
Cheers for the life they will lead from now...
--- Unknown ---
(Hartright suddenly interrupts the toast - addresses Sir Percival Glyde)
--- Unknown ---
Hartright:  Please let me speak
And forgive my interruption
Please hear me out
On a very pressing matter
One that concerns a girl
Her name is Anne, Anne Cath'rick
She says you've done her wrong
Have you an explanation?
--- Unknown ---
Mr. Fairlie: What impertinence! Mr. Hartright, know your place sir!
--- Unknown ---
Glyde: No, no, Mr. Fairlie, I am glad that he asked this. Please, please.
I am happy to clear up the matter of Anne Catherick...
--- Unknown ---
Glyde: Her tale is truly sorrowful
And some would say a tragedy
Her story breaks my heart
I don't know where to start
Her mother was in my employ
(to Mr. Fairlie) Your brother recommended her
Recall, she worked here too?
--- Unknown ---
Mr. Fairlie: Catherick? I'm not sure that I do.
--- Unknown ---
Glyde: Anne was so sweet as an infant
She used to laugh all the time
She sparkled like the sun
Such a pretty one
Yet she grew up so unhappy
Sullen and angry and sad
She was a troubled child
Acting strange and wild
She once attacked her mother
When she was just sixteen
A fury with no pause
No one knew the cause
To help her grieving mother
And rescue Anne herself
I undertook her care
I tried to see her through
It was the Christian thing to do
--- Unknown ---
When no physician could treat her
I found a haven that would
A trusted private place
To embrace her case
Anne thinks of me as her captor
When I am truly her friend
For all her care I pay
Still she runs away.
--- Unknown ---
(Fosco who appears moved by the story shakes Glyde by the hand)
--- Unknown ---
Fosco: I'm touched by your compassion
Your kindness knows no bounds.
--- Unknown ---
Glyde: I've done the best I can
I've done my best for Anne.
--- Unknown ---
(Once again Hartright speaks up)
--- Unknown ---
Hartright: She spoke sir of a secret
A secret she would tell.
--- Unknown ---
Glyde: Her world has come to be utter fantasy
But her safe return
Is my great concern
And I am grateful for
Your help.
--- Unknown ---
Laura: Poor Anne.
Her story saddens me.
--- Unknown ---
Marian: Yet it explains the mystery.
--- Unknown ---
Fosco: Had it not been for Glyde
I'm sure she would have died.
--- Unknown ---
Mr. Fairlie: No more please!
Neither Anne Catherick nor her silly mother are any of your business, sir.
And once more, my nerves are quite shot.
--- Unknown ---
Fosco: Then a shot of brandy is what I prescribe, Signor!
--- Unknown ---
Mr. Fairlie: Yes, let us retire at once to my study, gentlemen.
--- Unknown ---
(Glyde, Fosco, and Mr. Fairlie leave.  Glyde bows his thanks again to Hartright)
--- Unknown ---
Glyde: Thank you, sir.
--- Unknown ---
(Hartright is left with the two women)
--- Unknown ---
Hartright: I don't believe him
Can't you see he's clearly lying
As for your uncle
It's the truth that he's denying.
--- Unknown ---
Marian: Sir, you must leave at once.
You must go right away.
--- Unknown ---
Laura: But, Marian-
--- Unknown ---
Marian: What reason has he to lie?
How can you hope to stay here?
--- Unknown ---
Laura: Please Marian-
--- Unknown ---
Marian:  Laura our future is settled
Soon you'll be Lady Glyde
You'll have a perfect life
As that fine man's wife
He is a man of compassion
Look how he helped that poor girl
He has integrity
He's all a man should be!
--- Unknown ---
(Laura looks to Hartright)
--- Unknown ---
Hartright: I clearly don't belong here
Your sister is quite right
I leave for London now!
--- Unknown ---
(Laura runs out, upset)
--- Unknown ---
Hartright: (to Marian) Are you happy now?
--- Unknown ---
(He exits.  Marian left alone crumples, begins to cry)
--- Unknown ---
Marian: I close my eyes and I still see his face.
--- Unknown ---
(She exits)
--- Unknown ---
The Tryst
--- Unknown ---
(Hartright is there with his bags and easel, departing.
Laura enters in haste, wearing a white nightdress)
--- Unknown ---
Laura: Tell me this isn't happening.  Tell me I'm walking in my sleep.
--- Unknown ---
Hartright: I'm sorry.
--- Unknown ---
Laura: I believe my heart
It believes in you
--- Unknown ---
Laura and Hartright: Ev'ry part of ev'ry thought leads me straight to you.
--- Unknown ---
(She gives him the sketch that he gave to her in the drawing lesson)
--- Unknown ---
Laura: Take this...something to remember me by.
