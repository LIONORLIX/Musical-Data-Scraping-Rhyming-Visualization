------ If Not for Me for Her ------
--- MARIAN ---
--- Unknown ---
Can you find it in your heart
To overlook what i've done
And make another start
Once again
As we were
--- Unknown ---
I am overcome with shame
Will you let me rebuild the bridge I've set aflame
Can we be as we were
If not for me for her
--- Unknown ---
I know that I've wronged you
And that I can't defend
I hope I haven't
That you're my one true friend
--- Unknown ---
With such sadness
We both live
Though it's unpardonable
I ask you to forgive
Can't we be
As we were?
If not for me
