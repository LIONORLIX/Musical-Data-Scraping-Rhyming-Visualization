--- Laura ---
She's not here!
--- Marian ---
Have faith! She will come.
--- Laura (startled) ---
What's that?
--- Marian ---
Hush! Be calm.
--- Unknown ---
(Anne appears to them. Laura and Anne gaze in awe at each other)
--- Laura ---
I look at you and see myself
--- Anne ---
I look at you and see myself
--- Laura and Anne ---
So strange and yet so true
I see my soul in you
--- Laura ---
Almost my living replica
--- Marian ---
It's true!
--- Anne ---
Our every move so similar
--- Marian ---
So much like you!
--- Laura ---
My face but with years of strain
--- Laura and Anne (to one another) ---
Your eyes reveal such pain
--- Trio ---
It's like I've known you all my life
At last it's safe to hope again
--- Unknown ---
Somehow you complete me
I know I can trust you
Here with you
I am safe at last
You were there
You were always there
Like your heart
Beats within my heat
And the truth
It can set us free
--- Unknown ---
Now that we're together
We must help each other
--- Unknown ---
(Suddenly gunshots are heard and the strange sound of hunting horns)
--- Anne ---
I hear them coming
They've come to lock me up!
Don't let them catch me!
Don't let them take me back!
--- Unknown ---
(She starts to run. The women follow her.)
--- Marian and Laura ---
Wait! Anne- Anne we will help you!
--- Unknown ---
(Sir Percival appears with servants)
--- Men ---
The one in white!
She must not get away again.
--- Glyde (to Laura and Marian) ---
I thank you both
For having led me straight to her!
--- Unknown ---
(Men try to capture Anne. She turns on Laura)
--- Anne ---
You have betrayed me!
You have set a trap here!
--- Laura ---
No, no believe me!
--- Anne ---
Curse you, Lady Glyde!
--- Glyde ---
Take her back to the asylum!
--- Unknown ---
(The men grab for her. She tries to escape, but is caught again.)
--- Anne (to Glyde) ---
You may lock me up forever
But I will set my secret free!
You can't stop me
Now I'll tell the whole world what you did to me!
--- Glyde ---
Shut up her mouth and her horrible lies!
--- Unknown ---
(The men try to gag her.)
--- Laura ---
Let her go!
--- Marian ---
Count Fosco, you've got to help us!
--- Unknown ---
(Fosco goes to Anne. She struggles, screaming. He injects her with a sedative. She faints into the arms of the men- her captors.)
--- Fosco ---
I'm sorry, but the woman was a danger to herself.
I had no choice. It is the best way. I am a doctor
--- Unknown ---
(Sir Percival and Fosco exit with Anne and the other men. The two women are left, shivering and afraid.)
--- Laura ---
We are powerless at the hands of these men!
--- Unknown ---
(Marian puts her arms round her sister)
--- Marian ---
We will not be victims, Laura.
We will right this wrong.
