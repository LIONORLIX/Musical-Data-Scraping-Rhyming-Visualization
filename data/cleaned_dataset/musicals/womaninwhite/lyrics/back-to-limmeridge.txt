------ Back to Limmeridge ------
--- PERCIVAL GLIDE ---
--- Unknown ---
Here use this pen
Sign here and here
And we'll be done
--- UNCLE ---
--- Unknown ---
There is just the small question of my future
Limmeridge house has been my home for many years
You have no plans to sell, Sir?
--- PERCIVAL GLYDE ---
--- Unknown ---
No immediate plans
--- UNCLE ---
--- Unknown ---
Then my future here is assured?
I'm old sir and infirmed
--- PERCIVAL GLYDE ---
--- Unknown ---
I am well aware of that
--- UNCLE ---
--- Unknown ---
So you have no plans?
--- PERCIVAL GLYDE ---
--- Unknown ---
I leave straight from here for a long sanget on the continent. My seat on the train is booked.
Sir, your signature.
--- UNCLE ---
--- Unknown ---
Her estate is yours
Spend it wisely Glyde
--- PERCIVAL GLYDE ---
--- Unknown ---
Thank you kindly sir
--- UNCLE ---
--- Unknown ---
Tragic that she died
Stay and have one drink
In memory of my niece
--- PERCIVAL GLYDE ---
--- Unknown ---
I have to catch my train
--- UNCLE ---
--- Unknown ---
May she rest in peace
--- PERCIVAL GLYDE ---
--- Unknown ---
But sir
I can't miss the train
--- UNCLE ---
--- Unknown ---
Don't haunt me in this way
Brother I have done your dirty work for far too long
For years i've kept your secrets
I've brought up your children
They weren't mine
This has brought me ill health, unhappiness
That's your legacy!
I wanted no part of this
--- SERVANT ---
--- Unknown ---
You can't go in there!
--- HARTRIGHT ---
--- Unknown ---
We have some pressing questions!
--- UNCLE ---
--- Unknown ---
Explain this rude intrusion!
--- HARTRIGHT ---
--- Unknown ---
You must tell us who's Anne Cattrick!
--- MARIAN ---
--- Unknown ---
Uncle you have got to help us!
--- UNCLE ---
--- Unknown ---
I don't know what you speak of
--- HARTRIGHT ---
--- Unknown ---
There's no more time for secrets
--- MARIAN ---
--- Unknown ---
Long ago her mother worked here
--- HARTRIGHT ---
--- Unknown ---
We won't leave without an answer
--- UNCLE ---
--- Unknown ---
What presumption! Know your place sir!
--- HARTRIGHT ---
--- Unknown ---
ALl along you've known the truth sir
--- MARIAN ---
--- Unknown ---
Good God Anne Cattrick is dead sir!
She lies in Laura's grave
--- UNCLE ---
--- Unknown ---
What nonsense you speak of!
It is Laura who is dead
God rest her soul!
My niece is dead
--- Unknown ---
(Music begins to play on the piano. It is Laura's song)
--- Unknown ---
What witchcraft is this?
--- LAURA ---
--- Unknown ---
Come believe your eyes Uncle
I was placed in the asylum
Anne went to my grave
If you ever loved me Uncle tell me who she was
--- UNCLE ---
--- Unknown ---
Your father loved the ladies
Anne's mother was a pretty one
You can guess the rest
Though you and Anne were born a year apart
You could easily have passed for twins
Save you were wanted
And she was not
--- LAURA ---
--- Unknown ---
She was my sister?
--- UNCLE ---
--- Unknown ---
Yes
--- LAURA ---
--- Unknown ---
And Glyde killed her
--- UNCLE ---
--- Unknown ---
What?
--- HARTRIGHT ---
--- Unknown ---
He won't get away with this
--- UNCLE ---
--- Unknown ---
I'm afraid he already has
He's on his way to the Continent
Your estate has already passed to him
He left just before you arrived
--- LAURA ---
--- Unknown ---
What is this secret my sister spoke of?
Uncle do you know?
--- UNCLE ---
--- Unknown ---
I assure you
I know nothing more
I'm sorry
--- LAURA ---
--- Unknown ---
Then it is over
Glyde has won
--- HARTRIGHT ---
--- Unknown ---
We can catch him
We can hit him off
He'll need to take the London train
--- MARIAN ---
--- Unknown ---
I'll go with you
Laura you rest here
--- LAURA ---
--- Unknown ---
No! I'll never rest again
We can stop him
I have a plan!
Anne shall haunt him
