------ The Document ------
--- Laura ---
You wanted me?
--- Glyde ---
I have a document for you to sign
--- Laura ---
A document?
--- Glyde ---
Sit here, use my pen.
--- Laura ---
A document, what kind of document?
--- Glyde ---
Just sign it here, and here, and we'll be done
--- Laura ---
Now?
--- Glyde ---
It's a formality
Sign your name Lady Glyde
Here, on the line.
--- Laura ---
What are you asking me to sign?
--- Unknown ---
(Fosco enters, all civility)
--- Fosco ---
Percival, you said you needed me
I am at your service
Ah, Buongiorno, ladies
I trust you slept well?
--- Glyde ---
I need a witness to Laura's signature
--- Laura ---
Again, what is this document?
--- Glyde ---
Sign your name Lady Glyde
--- Marian ---
Sir! She has a right to know
--- Glyde ---
It pertains, Miss Halcombe,
To a man and his wife
--- Laura ---
Then let me read it first
That isn't asking much
--- Glyde ---
Sign, I have a carriage waiting!
--- Marian (to Count Fosco) ---
Do you know what's in these papers?
--- Fosco ---
I'm as ignorant as you and Lady Glyde
--- Glyde ---
Sign!
--- Laura ---
But I cannot sign
What I haven't read
--- Glyde ---
It is too involved
For your pretty head
As a sign of trust
Please pick up the pen
--- Laura ---
I will read it first
I will trust you then
--- Marian ---
Let our lawyer bless
What you want from her
And she'll acquiesce
With her signature
--- Glyde ---
You've a pointed tone
That I will not bear
--- Marian ---
That's a point of view
I completely share
--- Glyde ---
Sign your name Lady Glyde
Infernal women,
You know nothing about business!
--- Fosco ---
Calmly my dear friend
Lady Glyde's upset
So is her sister
Can't the papers wait another day?
--- Glyde ---
This is a timely matter
And it will not wait
--- Laura ---
I will gladly sign when I know what it is.
--- Fosco ---
Forget about the signature.
I'm urging you, please,
As a man of honor. Be patient.
--- Marian ---
Send the carriage away
--- Fosco ---
In all good conscience
I could not be a witness now.
--- Glyde ---
For God's sake, woman, sign!
I will not stand for it. I will not!
--- Unknown ---
(Sir Percival goes to strike his wife. He is prevented by Fosco and Marian)
--- Marian ---
Stop it! Stop it!
--- Glyde ---
She is still my wife!
She'll do as I say!
--- Fosco ---
Keep your temper, sir!
--- Glyde ---
Stay out of my way!
You must be confined
Till you see the light
--- Marian ---
This is not a jail!
--- Fosco ---
Sir, this is not right!
--- Glyde ---
She should gladly do
Anything I say
She's a willful child
Who must have her way
--- Fosco (firmly) ---
Glyde! You must hold your tongue!
You must not react
You must leave at once
-your good name intact
--- Unknown ---
(Sir Percival leaves)
--- Fosco (reaching out to Laura) ---
You'll be fine Lady Glyde
--- Laura ---
Don't touch me
--- Fosco ---
You are safe my dear
You'll be all right
His bark is far worse
Than his spite
His temper flares
Don't be alarmed
He will calm down
You will not be harmed
--- Marian ---
Without your aid
Where would we be?
--- Fosco ---
How could I not?
--- Laura ---
Don't come near me!
--- Marian ---
He's our friend!
Look what he's done.
--- Laura ---
I don't trust him-
Or anyone.
--- Fosco ---
