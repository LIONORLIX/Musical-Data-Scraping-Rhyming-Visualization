(The conservatory. Marian enters)
--- Marian ---
Is she not the way that I described her?
We're as unalike as black and white
--- Laura ---
Still we are insep'rable
--- Marian ---
Joined as day to night,
Very clearly of a diff'rent feather-
We're an odd but merry pair of birds!
She'd say I'm verbose and garrulous-
--- Laura ---
But in fewer words!
--- Marian ---
Laura!
--- Laura (to Hartright) ---
I fear your journey here was tedious?
--- Hartright ---
My journey was filled with drama!
First I met the local Signal Man- a strange and
Unearthly man. He told me he'd had a vision that I
Would come and that I would bring tragedy in my wake.
--- Laura ---
Heavens!
--- Hartright ---
Indeed!
But he said: ?You'll mark my words!
When a year to this day
The dead lie on the tracks!
The dead lie on the tracks!?
--- Marian ---
How strange!
--- Hartright ---
What happened next was stranger still
A woman breathless and afraid
Appeared out of the night!
Completely dressed in white
She had a secret she would tell
Of one who had mistreated her.
Her face and frightened gaze
My mind cannot erase?
But then she ran from view.
(to Laura) She looked so much like you.
--- Laura ---
Perhaps you saw a ghost?
--- Hartright ---
Ghost or not, she haunts me still.
She looked so much like you?
Marian:
We must clear up this mystery!
--- Hartright ---
But first, ladies, we must take
Advantage of this wonderful light!

(A beautiful summer's day for their first drawing lesson.
They are outside in the formal gardens of Limmeridge House with a couple of servants, all three
before their easels, drawing. We hear both what they express openly and their inner thoughts)
--- Marian ---
Nothing's duller than my watercoloring
I've next to no technique at all
--- Laura ---
My pen and ink are passable
--- Marian ---
My pen and ink appall.
All my sketching soon will have you retching.
I'm a notch below a chimpanzee.
--- Laura ---
But we're highly trainable.
--- Marian ---
We shall wait and see.
--- Hartright ---
You can capture shade and light
Best of all perspective
--- Unknown ---
Marian: All I ever do is tright
--- Hartright ---
Beauty is subjective
You'll develop your own style
--- Marian ---
He has such a winning smile
--- Hartright ---
You will know when it feels right
--- Laura ---
I could trust him at first sight
--- Hartright ---
Be observant, be a humble servant
Solely dedicated to your art
--- Laura ---
I can hardly concentrate
--- Marian ---
What a shaky start.
--- Hartright ---
Don't conceal the things you think and feel
Get your emotion flowing through your brush
--- Marian ---
If I follow your advice
You would surely blush
--- Laura ---
If I practiced what you preach
I'd be more effective
--- Hartright (gazing at Laura) ---
She's so clearly out of reach
Seen from my perspective
--- Marian ---
He's a breath of summer air
--- Hartright ---
See the sunlight in her hair
--- Laura ---
I must disregard his charms
--- Laura and Marian ---
And his manly rugged arms
--- Marian ---
Give me people not a tree or steeple
Not a slice of apple and a knife
Still life's not as int'resting
As a slice of life
--- Hartright (looking at Marian's drawing) ---
You're improving, this is very moving,
That's a cocker spaniel clear and true.
--- Marian ---
Thank you for the compliment
I was sketching you!
--- All Three ---
What's the reason I am here?
What is my objective?
What a stirring atmosphere!
But where is my perspective?
--- Unknown ---
Can you get a dizzy thrill?
While the world is standing still?
Yet the summer's drifting by
