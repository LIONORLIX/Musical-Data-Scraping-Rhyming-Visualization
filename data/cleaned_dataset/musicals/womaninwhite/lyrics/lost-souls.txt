------ Lost Souls ------
--- Unknown ---
Lost souls, all of us searching,
Never finding, what we are seeking.
All hope, long ago buried,
Here in London, in a sea of strangers.
--- Unknown ---
We're pris'ners, in darkness,
Rats in a cage,
With anger, and hunger to fuel our rage.
More of the same each bloody day,
Best you should stay, out of our way.
--- Unknown ---
We drink to let go of the life that we know.
It's hopeless, we're caught in the undertow.
Drowning in gin each endless night,
Endlessly spoiling, for a fight.
--- Marian ---
Can you help me? There's a man I'm searching for.
Can you help me? Walter Hartwright is his name.
--- Unknown ---
Questions, all without answers,
And our business, is to forget them.
Lost souls, all of us searching,
Here in London, in a sea of strangers.
--- Unknown ---
We're here to let go of our worries,
Fill your bitter cup.
No need to look forwards or backwards,
Only bottoms up.
--- Marian ---
Please sir help me? There's a man that I must find.
Can you help me? Walter Hartwright is his name.
--- Conman ---
Hartwright? Did you say Walter Hartwright?
Yes I know him, I'll take you to him.
I know him, I'll take you to where he will be,
Delighted to help you, believe you me.
--- Unknown ---
Here among the missing,
A city with no answers,
We're looking for salvation,
In endless desperation,
With gin to dull our senses,
And chase away our demons,
And though we'll never find it,
We'll drink until we're blinded.
