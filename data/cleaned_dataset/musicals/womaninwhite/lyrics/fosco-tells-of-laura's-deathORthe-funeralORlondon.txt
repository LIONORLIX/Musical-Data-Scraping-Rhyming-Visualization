------ Fosco Tells of Laura's Death/The Funeral/London ------
--- COUNT FOSCO ---
--- Unknown ---
Miss Halcombe
It is behatch
I'm so terribly sorry
There is no easy way to say this
Your sister
She is dead
She was walking in her sleep
--- MARIAN ---
--- Unknown ---
What are you saying! (sobbing)
--- COUNT FOSCO ---
--- Unknown ---
She had sent her maid away
As is her custom I understand
She walked to her window
And she fell from a great height you see
It's a tragic accident
I am so deeply sorry
I am leaving for London today
If you need anything
Anything at all
This is where you'll find me
--- Unknown ---
PRIEST (At the graveyard)
--- Unknown ---
I am the life and the resurrection
Said The Lord
Who so ever liveth and believeth in me
Shall never die
--- SIR PERCIVAL GLYDE ---
--- Unknown ---
How can the good Lord take my love away
Far too young
Far too good
I have to face forever
All without my love
There's no describing my sadness
She was the light of my life
And life is so unfair
Such a cross to bear
Still there's the will to contend with
All kinds of papers to sign
I can't believe she's gone
Yet we must go on
--- Unknown ---
LAURA's UNCLE
--- Unknown ---
How can you talk of business!
Good God it's much too soon!
--- SIR PERCIVAL GLYDE ---
--- Unknown ---
Of course we'll wait a bit
That's appropriate
--- Unknown ---
LAURA'S UNCLE
--- Unknown ---
I'm much too overcome now
My nerves are simply flayed
Why don't you come to me
In June
--- SIR PERCIVAL GLYDE ---
--- Unknown ---
Marian
I hope you still think of me as your brother
--- MARIAN ---
--- Unknown ---
I don't believe a word
Everything he utters is a lie
I was powerless
Just a woman!
Too weak to save you!
I have no doubt he murdered you!
Laura!
You were all I had
I can't believe your gone
Where is Walter
He's the only one
You and I can count upon
All for Laura
I will be strong
I will live to right
This wrong
--- Unknown ---
(On the Streets of London. Walter Hartright passes by a man begging on the streets)
--- BEGGAR ---
--- Unknown ---
Spare me a penny
Sir
--- HARTRIGHT ---
--- Unknown ---
This is my last one
--- BEGGAR ---
--- Unknown ---
Then I won't deprive you
--- HARTRIGHT ---
--- Unknown ---
Please take it
It's yours
--- WHORE ---
--- Unknown ---
It takes some comfort
It'll help you forget sir
--- HARTRIGHT ---
