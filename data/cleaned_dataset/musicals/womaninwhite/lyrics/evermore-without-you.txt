------ Evermore Without You ------
--- Unknown ---
Ever on my mind
Evermore without you
I'll never know a thought or feeling That isn't about you
Nevermore alone
Never to forget you
Not when my life was changed forever The first time I met you
You're all I know
And though I've lost you,
You're someone I can't let go
--- Unknown ---
Every living day
Ever filled with sorrow
How can I face a life without you
Or even tomorrow?
Evermore without you
Were we never meant to be?
--- Unknown ---
Nevermore alone

Not when my life was changed the first Time I met you
You're all I know
And though I've lost you,
You're someone I can't let go
--- Unknown ---
Every living day
Ever filled with sorrow
How can I face a life without you
Or even tomorrow?
Evermore without you
Were we never meant to be?
--- Unknown ---
Every living day
Ever filled with sorrow
How can I face a life
without you...
--- Unknown ---
Evermore without you
We were never meant to be.
