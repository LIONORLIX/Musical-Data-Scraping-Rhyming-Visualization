------ Asylum ------
--- WOMAN ---
--- Unknown ---
Yes?
What's your business here?
--- HARTRIGHT ---
--- Unknown ---
We are representatives of Sir Percival Glyde
We're here to see Anne Cattrick.
--- MARIAN ---
--- Unknown ---
I feel so nervous
--- HARTRIGHT ---
--- Unknown ---
You've been so brave
--- MARIAN ---
--- Unknown ---
There is something
I must say to you
Something i've held deep inside for so long
--- WOMAN ---
--- Unknown ---
Only one of you
--- Unknown ---
(the woman leads marian through the patients in the asylum to Anne)
--- Unknown ---
Cattrick
You can have five minutes
Not that you'll get much sense from her
--- MARIAN ---
--- Unknown ---
Anne?
Anne Cattrick
--- Unknown ---
(Marian realizes that it is infact her sister Laura and not Anne Cattrick)
--- MARIAN ---
--- Unknown ---
Laura?
--- LAURA ---
--- Unknown ---
Marian? MARIAN!
--- HARTRIGHT ---
--- Unknown ---
How can this be?
--- LAURA ---
--- Unknown ---
They held me down and drugged me
They dressed me in Anne's clothing
--- MARIAN ---
--- Unknown ---
I was sure I heard some screaming
But they told me I was dreaming!
--- LAURA ---
--- Unknown ---
They brought me here that evening
Underneath a cloud of darkness
Though I told them who I was
There was no one who believed me!
--- MARIAN ---
--- Unknown ---
Then it was Anne they buried
Claiming it was you!
--- LAURA ---
--- Unknown ---
What?
--- HARTRIGHT ---
--- Unknown ---
There isn't time now
We must get out of here!
We've got to stop Glyde before he gets away!
--- Unknown ---
I will redeem this pledge
--- LAURA ---
--- Unknown ---
Marian I don't understand!
What have they done to Anne!
Tell me!
--- MARIAN ---
--- Unknown ---
Oh Laura I am so sorry!
Anne Cattrick is dead!
--- LAURA ---
--- Unknown ---
What?
--- MARIAN ---
--- Unknown ---
I believe they killed her
--- HARTRIGHT ---
--- Unknown ---
And put you in this asylum in her place
--- LAURA ---
--- Unknown ---
Please God No!
--- MARIAN ---
--- Unknown ---
Laura I am so sorry
--- LAURA ---
--- Unknown ---
Then her secret has gone with her to the grave!
--- MARIAN ---
--- Unknown ---
We musn't think about this now
We have to get you to safety
--- LAURA ---
--- Unknown ---
But we must know her secret
--- HARTRIGHT ---
--- Unknown ---
She's right
We have to go to Limmeridge
--- MARIAN ---
--- Unknown ---
Limmeridge?
--- HARTRIGHT ---
--- Unknown ---
We are but three miles away
And your uncle knows more than he's admitting
