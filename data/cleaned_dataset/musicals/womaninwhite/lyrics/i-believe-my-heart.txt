Whenever i look at you
The world disappears
All in a single glance so revealing
You smile and i feel as though
I've known you for years
How do i know to trust what i'm feeling?
--- Unknown ---
I believe my heart
What else can i do
When ev'ry part of ev'ry thought
Leads me straight to you
--- Unknown ---
I believe my heart
There's no other choice
For now whenever
My heart speaks
I can only hear your voice

The lifetime before we met
Has faded away
How did i live a moment without you?
You don't have to speak at all
I know what you'd say
And i know every secret about you
--- Unknown ---
I believe my heart
It believes in you
It's teling me
That what i see
Is completely true
I believe my heart
How can it be wrong
It says that what i feel for you
I will feel my whole life long
--- Unknown ---
Both
--- Unknown ---
I believe my heart
And it believes in you
It's telling me
That what i see
Is completely true
--- Unknown ---
And with all my soul
I belive my heart
The portrait that it paints of you
Is a perfect work of art
