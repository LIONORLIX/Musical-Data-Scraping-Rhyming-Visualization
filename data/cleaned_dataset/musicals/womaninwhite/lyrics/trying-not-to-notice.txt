------ Trying Not to Notice ------
--- Unknown ---
(We are now in wilder couldtryside. It is hot.
Collars are undone, shawls are abandoned.
Hartright starts to sketch laura)
--- Unknown ---
Marian
--- Unknown ---
Sweet tension fills the air
Which i know i ought not dwell upon
I look away and still see him there
I'm trying not to notice him
Yet i can't help but stare
--- Unknown ---
Hartright
--- Unknown ---
No gazing!
Know your place
Words that i'd be wise to tell myself!
I close my eyes and i still see her face
I'm trying not to notice her
But i don't stand a chance
--- Unknown ---
Laura
--- Unknown ---
I'm trying not to notice him
Yet i return each glance
A thousand contradictions
Are stirring in my soul
They seem to grow in me
Overflow in me
--- Unknown ---
Hartright
--- Unknown ---
In spite of my convictions
I'm losing my control
--- Unknown ---
Marian
--- Unknown ---
I'm slightly shocked inside
Keep it locked inside
--- Unknown ---
All three
--- Unknown ---
Unspoken
Unexpressed
Still it's louder than a symphony
Can no one hear what my heart seems to shout?
Perhaps they do not notice it
Though it's as plain as day
I'm trying not to notice it
But it won't go away

(the end of the lesson... Marian and laura gather up their brushes and paints.
They go to exit-laura realizes that she has forgotten something.
She returns to where hartright is. They both linger for a moment)
