--- SIR PERCIVAL GLYDE ---
--- Unknown ---
Hello!
You there!
Signalman!
Where in hell in the damn London train!
--- SIGNALMAN ---
--- Unknown ---
I've heard reports there's trouble on the line!
--- SIR PERCIVAL GLYDE ---
--- Unknown ---
That isn't expected!
My business here is over
I must make my connection
And why do you look at me in that way?
I've done nothing wrong!
What is that infernal noise!
--- SIGNALMAN ---
--- Unknown ---
It's the wires singing in the wind
They're calling me with news sir
There's danger on the line!
--- SIR PERCIVAL GLYDE ---
--- Unknown ---
This terrible nosie in my head!
Aahh!
Oh God, Anne Cattrick?
This isn't real
This cannot be
You do not exist
Get away from me!
--- ANNE CATTRICK ---
--- Unknown ---
You know why I'm here
And what you must say
So you must confess
--- SIR PERCIVAL GLYDE ---
--- Unknown ---
Woman Stay away
--- ANNE CATTRICK ---
--- Unknown ---
Tell the truth Percival Glyde!
You'll hear my voice inside your head
For all you're life and when you're dead
You won't be free until you express what you have done
Till you confess
You cannot hide!
You can't go far!
Everywhere you go i'll be where you are!
I know what you've done!
We both know it's true!
Secrets must be told
--- SIR PERCIVAL GLYDE ---
--- Unknown ---
I'm not afraid of you.
--- ANNE CATTRICK ---
--- Unknown ---
Everything you did
Every one will know!
--- SIR PERCIVAL GLYDE ---
--- Unknown ---
That's all in the past buried long ago
--- ANNE CATTRICK ---
--- Unknown ---
Tell the truth Percival Glyde!
Didn't you use me and hurt me!
--- SIR PERCIVAL GLYDE ---
--- Unknown ---
You were a beautiful girl
Like none i'd ever seen
You were just fifteen
--- ANNE CATTRICK ---
--- Unknown ---
You and I both know the secret
--- SIR PERCIVAL GLYDE ---
--- Unknown ---
Something that no one could prove
And who'd believe it's true
From the likes of you
You told me you were pregnant
You told me it was mine
It could have been alive
It deserved to die
I had to drown your bastard
I had no other choice
Before the child was due
I'd had enough of you
All that remains of your secret
Is buried in Black Water Lake
I watched as your disgrace
Sank without a trace
--- ANNE CATTRICK ---
--- Unknown ---
You beat me and you raped me
And then you drowned my child!
When I was mad from grief you imprisoned me!
My precious little baby
My heart within my heart
The child I never knew
All because of you!
And then you threw away my life!
--- SIR PERCIVAL GLYDE ---
--- Unknown ---
Your precious secret's meaningless
No one alive remembers you
And you can save your prayers
For no one truly cares
It's just like you were never born
And no one ever mourned for you!
--- Unknown ---
('Anne Cattrick' takes off the white veil shielding her face and reveals
that it is truly Laura and not Anne Cattrick)
--- LAURA ---
--- Unknown ---
You're wrong!
I mourned for Anne! Anne Cattrick!
And the child of yours that you destroyed!
--- SIR PERCIVAL GLYDE ---
--- Unknown ---
Laura!
--- LAURA ---
--- Unknown ---
This secret seals your fate forever!
And the charge that you can't avoid!
You have kept us both a prisoner!
But the truth has set us free
It will lock you up and damn your soul
For all of eternity!
--- SIR PERCIVAL GLYDE ---
--- Unknown ---
You little witch
You think you can trick me?
Come here!
I killed her
And I can kill you too
And the beauty of it is
No one will ever know
Because you're dead!
You're already dead!
--- Unknown ---
(Walter Hartright emerges from his hiding spot and he fights with Percival Glyde)
--- CHORUS ---
--- Unknown ---
He's over there!
We know exactly what you've done!
--- HARTRIGHT ---
--- Unknown ---
You see Glyde we all know what you've done!
You've found your own confession!
The game is over!
--- SIR PERCIVAL GLYDE ---
--- Unknown ---
The game is never over!
--- HARTRIGHT ---
--- Unknown ---
Don't go in there!
He said there's danger on the line!
--- Unknown ---
(Sir Percival Glyde runs into the dark tunnel where an oncoming train hits and kills him)
--- SIGNALMAN ---
--- Unknown ---
And a year to the day
The dead lie on the tracks
The dead lie on the tracks
--- MARIAN ---
--- Unknown ---
You were so brave and now we're free
--- LAURA ---
--- Unknown ---
It seemed like Anne was there with me
Her spirit was my guide
My sister by my side
--- Unknown ---
MARIAN/LARUA
--- Unknown ---
Within I know we'll never part
Her heart beats on within my heart
--- MARIAN ---
--- Unknown ---
Go to her right away
That it where to belong!
--- HARTRIGHT ---
--- Unknown ---
How can I ask your blessing
With all that we've been through
Our world has changed
--- MARIAN ---
--- Unknown ---
You must find it in your heart
To over look what we've done
And make another start
Once again
As we were
If not for me
For Her
--- HARTRIGHT ---
--- Unknown ---
Everypart of every thought
Leads me straight to you
--- Unknown ---
HARTRIGHT/LAURA
--- Unknown ---
And with all my soul
I believe my heart
The portrait that it paints of you
Is a perfect work of art
--- MARIAN ---
--- Unknown ---
I close my eyes!
And I still see his face!
