------ By My Side ------
--- Unknown ---
Where are you going?
Where are you going?
Can you take me with you?
For my hand is cold
And needs warmth
Where are you going?
--- Unknown ---
Far beyond where the horizon lies
Where the horizon lies
And the land sinks into mellow blueness
Oh please, take me with you
--- Unknown ---
Let me skip the road with you
I can dare myself
I can dare myself
I'll put a pebble in my shoe
And watch me walk (watch me walk)
I can walk and walk!
--- Unknown ---
I shall call the pebble Dare
I shall call the pebble Dare
We will talk, we will talk together
We will talk (chorus) about walking
Dare shall be carried
And when we both have had enough
I will take him from my shoe, singing:
Meet your new road!
Then I'll take your hand
Finally glad
Finally glad
That you are here
By my side
--- Unknown ---
By my side

(Spoken- Judas)
Then the man they called Judas Iscariot
Went to the chief priests, and said
What will you give me to betray Him to you?
They paid him thirty pieces of silver.
And from that moment, he began to look out for an opportunity
To betray Him.
