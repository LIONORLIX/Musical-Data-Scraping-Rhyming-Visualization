------ One of the Great Ones ------
--- SONNY ---
There's a kind of a girl who can sends you heart whirling away
But those are the kind you don't happen to find everyday
You'll meet smart ones and though ones.
Just good enough ones.
They're fine kid go out there, enjoy
But in all of your life you get only three shots at the real McCoy
--- Unknown ---
And this one could be one of the great ones
This one could be one of the ones you won't forget
If the stars in her eyes make your confidence rises like a rocket
that's ready to blow
Then she might be one of your great ones
Don't let her go
--- Unknown ---
Now you know instantly when one of your three comes along
'Cause she gazes at you and it's like you can do nothing wrong
All the sweet ones, the slight ones, the close but not quite ones
With them, you just get what you see
But the great one kid,
What they're showing you is,
The man you could be
--- Unknown ---
And this girl could be one of the great ones
This one could be one of the ones on who you bet
Do you fly off the rails with the wind in your sails whenever
she sends you a glance
Then she might be one of your great ones
Don't blow your chance
--- Unknown ---
Yeah This one could be one of the great ones
Yeah This one could be one of the ones you won't regret
If she's smiling at you like she knows
you'll come through and make you believe it somehow
Then kid you found one of those great ones,
Go to her now
Go to her now
Kid, go to her now
--- Unknown ---
Yeah this one could be one of those great ones
This one could be one of the ones you won't regret
Let your three slip away and you'll wonder one day
If maybe
If only
But oh
You don't forget one of your great ones
Trust me I know
