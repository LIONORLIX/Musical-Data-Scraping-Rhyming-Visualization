------ Out of Your Head (Reprise) ------
--- Unknown ---
my knees
Don't look at her
They find out they'll laugh at you for sure
What's it matter
She's not one of us
And you're just
Out of your head if you think that this ever could be
You're dreaming
Go back to bed you're out of your head
Girls like her don't happen to guys like me
--- Jane ---
That boy right there
I see him everywhere I go
He smiles, I stare
Could it be more I just don't know
--- Chorus ---
No
Don't be stupid
--- Jane ---
Told myself a million times before
--- Chorus ---
Don't be foolish
He is not your kind
--- Jane ---
And you're just out of your head if you think that this ever could be
You're dreaming
Go back to bed you're out of your head
Boys don't like him don't happen
--- Jane and Cologero ---
And you're just out of your head if you think that this ever could be
You're dreaming
Go back to bed you're out of your head
--- Jane ---
Boys don't like him don't happen to girls like me
--- Cologero ---
Girls like her don't happen to guys like me
--- Jane and Cologero ---
Things like this don't happen
--- Cologero ---
And then she's there
The chance would never come again
I say a prayer
Take one deep breath
And count to ten
Then I know it
Something tells me she much feel the same
Don't blow it
Simply ask her name
I must be out of my head
But I've got it as bad as can be
God help me
She is so fine but it's crossing a line
Girls like her don't happen
Girls like her can't happen
