------ Talent (Reprise #1) ------
--- Unknown ---
Sylvia.
She'll look every inch the star
In what i bought her
Now if she just remembers
All Iâ€™ve taught her...
Tonight we launch a new career
It won't be long before they cheer
And give her a standing ovation
First comes fortune then comes fame
Then the Tina doll and the Tina game,
She's going to become a corporation!

Judy. Stop it, Sylvia! (Doubles over in pain.) What am 1going to do?
--- Unknown ---
Sylvia. What's the matter, dear? (Catches on.) Oh. Are you having your ladies?
