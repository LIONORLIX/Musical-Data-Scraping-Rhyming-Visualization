------ Angel Mom ------
--- Unknown ---
When was a little girl.
A little girl of seven
My mommy unexpectedly
Went on a trip to heaven
And daddy dear would kiss my tear
When I would start to cry
--- Unknown ---
Judy. (Suddenly, as if possessed.) It’s too big, Sylvia!
--- Unknown ---
Sylvia. I beg your pardon?
--- Unknown ---
Judy. (Slowly, intuitively.) It’s...too big. You want the audience to come to you. (Mystified by her own words.)
--- Unknown ---
Sylvia. Excuse me, Judy Denmark, but what would you possibly know about it?
--- Unknown ---
Judy. (Slowly gaining confidence.) | know enough to see you're pushing for results. You're not in the moment. You have no subtext. You don't know the first thing about Pippi Longstocking. (Self-assured.) You're not even acting. I see what you're doing.
--- Unknown ---
Sylvia. You wouldn't dare.
Judy. (in her face.) You're indicating!
--- Unknown ---
(Sylvia indicates being mortified, turns away, taggers upstage.)
--- Unknown ---
Tina. Mama? Will you show me how it’s done?
--- Unknown ---
(Judy slowly removes her apron and tosses it aside, just as she’s about to sing, she falters.)
--- Unknown ---
Judy. I can’t. (turns away.)
Sylvia. (turns to her.) Yes. You can.
--- Unknown ---
Judy. (Instantly turns back, sings, remaining perfectly still.)
--- Unknown ---
When i was a little girl
A little girl of seven
My mommy unexpectedly
Went on a trip to heaven
And daddy dear would kiss my tear
When i would start to cry
And say though mommy's dead
She's overhead
An angel in the sky
--- Unknown ---
(Slowly, her arms start moving. She looks at her hands in wonder.)
--- Unknown ---
Mama? (Looks to heaven.) M...m...mama?
--- Unknown ---
(Remaining in place, she sings, gesturing expressively with her arms and hands.)
--- Unknown ---
Now when I lay me down to sleep
I don't turn off the light
So mom can find me when she comes
To kiss my cheek good night
Of course i raise my window now
Before I get in bed
It wouldn't want my angel mom.
To bang her angel head
--- Unknown ---
(She owns it.) I’m a talented girl, mama!
--- Unknown ---
(Takes the stage with confidence.)
--- Unknown ---
You may say I’m mother-less
But I must disagree
I live for my mother
And my mother lives in me
Now everything I’ll ever do
And everything I’ll be
I’ll be because of mommy dear
My mother lives in me!
--- Unknown ---
Tina! Take the third chorus! (Coaching her brusquely.)
--- Unknown ---
Tina.
You may say i'm mother-less
But i must disagree
--- Unknown ---
Judy.
Arms!
--- Unknown ---
Tina.(throws arms open.)
I live for my mother
And my mother lives in me
--- Unknown ---
Judy. Smile, baby!
--- Unknown ---
(Sylvia watches with tears in her eyes as mother and daughter perform side by side, the mirror image of one another.)
--- Unknown ---
Judy & Tina.
Now everything I ever do
And everything I’ll be
I'll be because of mommy dear
Mommy's here!
My mother lives in me!
