--- Sylvia St. Croiz ---
Talent!
Where does it come from?
My name is Sylvia St. Croix
Where does talent come from?
Is it?a?product of one's?environment, something you pick up off?the street?
Or is talent something you're born with, something passed down from generation to generation?
Something in the blood?
I wonder, meet Judy Denmark
Pretty, isn't she?
A wife and mother, leading an idyllic suburban life
