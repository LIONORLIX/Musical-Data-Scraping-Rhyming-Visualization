Remember the night
Won my first tony
Thanked my producers
Sonoco and sonny
I thanked my director
My hairdresser, Paul
I thanked all the people,
Both little and small
And assure you
The tears that i dabbed
Were not for the backs
That i stabbed
Be ruthless
Take a gander at me... Ruthless
Unconditionally... Ruthless
That's the game you must play
To hit the heights
