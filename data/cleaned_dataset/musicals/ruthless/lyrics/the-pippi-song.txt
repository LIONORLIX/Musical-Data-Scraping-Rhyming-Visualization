Louise.
Oh.
Howdy-do
My name is Pippi
P-l-p-p-o!
I betcha think that I’m a fool,
Cause i don't go to school
So tm not smart, i'm not bright
That's okay, that's all good
Anyone as cute as me
Don't need a phd
In bora bora no one's bored.
This island's all the rage
It's full. O’ hula dancers,
And there's no stinkin’ drinkin’ age
Our adventure's just begun
And now that you all met me,
Meet my water gun
