------ Let's Go To London ------
--- Monica ---
Let’s go to London
--- Ian ---
I knew you were going to say that
--- Monica ---
Let’s go right now
--- Ian ---
I’ve only known you a week!
--- Monica ---
Let’s pack a bag, grab a bus without fuss
And get out of this town, just the two of us!
--- Ian ---
Monica, please.
--- Monica ---
Let’s go to London
London is drunk on punk
It’s the queen’s jubilee and as far as the eye can see
The whole world is watching
Something’s going on there
Something no one’s ever seen before
London, London
Let’s get there now
--- Ian ---
We got nowhere to stay!
--- Monica ---
I got this cousin
He manages bands
He knows the scene, we can stay at his place in Goldiers Green
You know what I mean?
--- Ian ---
What about your Daddy?
What about the university?
--- Monica ---
London, London
Let’s get there now
--- Unknown ---
Lovely London, let’s take a hike
Let’s go spare in Lester’s Square, see what it’s like
--- Ian ---
On your bike?
--- Monica ---
Are you in or are you not?
I hear that Piccadeli’s got a new wave crashing
Everyone’s forming bands
--- Ian ---
Can’t.
--- Monica ---
Won’t!
--- Ian ---
Musn’t.
--- Monica ---
Must!
--- Ian ---
No.
--- Monica ---
No?
--- Ian ---
Yes.
--- Monica ---
Yes!
--- Ian ---
No!
--- Monica ---
I love London
London’s a smash
Guess where I was’ I was just at the Roxie
Seeing The Clash
--- Ian ---
You saw The Clash?
--- Monica ---
I met Joe Strummer
--- Ian ---
You met Joe Strummer?
--- Monica ---
Joe said, ‘Mon’?
--- Ian ---
He called you Mon?
--- Monica ---
‘Get out of your head, write a new wave song
Before the money is gone.’
Everywhere you look, there’s record companies with big fat checks!
Sign here, punk boy, next to the x
--- Ian ---
What’s this?
--- Monica ---
It’s a contract from Percy Parker at Rip-Off Records.
--- Ian ---
For you and me?
--- Monica ---
Yeah, only we’re not you and me anymore. I’m Lillian Filth, and you’re?
--- Ian ---
Perry Como-toast? That’s diabolical!
--- Monica ---
Exactly!
--- Both ---
I love London’s ranting rage
Let’s write the press with the best of invader
God save the new wave!
--- Announcer ---
Take one: The Diabolicals, All I Want is Everything’ooh, don’t we all’ Let’s go, my stinking lovelies.
