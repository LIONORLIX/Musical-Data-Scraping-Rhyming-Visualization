------ All I Want Is Everything ------
--- Monica ---
One, two, three, four!
--- Both ---
Ahh
I’m a danger to society
And I’m a stranger to sobriety
But to the left and to the right of me
I am gaining a variety
Can you hear the radio’
Everybody loves a nineteen hero
--- Ian ---
I am horrible
--- Monica ---
Absolutely diabolical
--- Ian ---
Above eccentricity
--- Monica ---
Is great publicity!
You put me in the paper
--- Ian ---
Spin me on your stereo
--- Both ---
Round and around and away we go!
All I want is everything
All I want is more
I was born for everything
That’s what I live for
--- Announcer ---
This Roger Hartby, Radio 1, with The Diabolicals.
--- Monica ---
You’re ugly!
--- Announcer ---
Lillian Filth, how does it feel to be number 29 on the charts’
--- Monica ---
Bollocks! It’s great.
--- Ian ---
We’re number 28.
--- Monica ---
With a bullet.
--- Ian ---
We’re number 17.
--- Monica ---
We’re looking good.
--- Both ---
We’re 10,
Wait, 7’
No, 6, 5, 4
--- Monica ---
Well, lick my bum.
--- Ian ---
We’re number one.
--- Both ---
Maintain velocity, that’s our philosophy
--- Ian ---
I’m a genuine atrocity
--- Monica ---
And that’s a mighty curiousity!
It’s a ticket to the South of Record, Hollywood
--- Ian ---
You may not like us
--- Monica ---
But you should!
--- Ian ---
Cause we’re good!
--- Both ---
We’re really bloody good, oh
All I want is everything
All I want is more
I was born for everything
That’s what I’m here for
Everything, everything
E-e-e-e-e-e-e
All I want is everything
Fuck you!
