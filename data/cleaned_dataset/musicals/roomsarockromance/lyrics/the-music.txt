------ The Music ------
--- Ian ---
I’ve got everything I need right here. My records, my amp, my lava lamp, and my guitar.
It’s my best friend in the whole wide world. She never lets me down.

A bit anti-social, aren’t you’
--- Ian ---
Hey well can you blame me’
Have u seen the public lately’
What a total shambles
Blindly ambling into oblivion
Grasping at straws with their muddy little paws
I prefer it inside my room
There’s a safety level to this womb
Where the melodies serenade me
With their harmony parade
And the music gets me
--- Unknown ---
Mama, can you lend me 15 quid
To buy that guitar in Woolworth’s window’
Mama can you lend me’ And she did
15 quid for this guitar in Woolworth’s window
--- Unknown ---
The casual cruelties of man are many
I look for good but I can’t find any
I turn to the rhythm, I bow down to the beat
It helps me keep the outside world outside on the street
It’s psychological
--- Monica ---
It’s pathological
--- Both ---
But sing along, come on
Like my music
Mama can you lend me 15 quid
To buy that guitar in Woolworth’s window
Mama can you lend me, and she did
15 quid for this guitar in Woolworth’s window
--- Ian ---
Live it
Give it
Live it
My music
