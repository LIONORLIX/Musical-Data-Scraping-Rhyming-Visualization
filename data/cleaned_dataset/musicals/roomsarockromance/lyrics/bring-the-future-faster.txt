------ Bring The Future Faster ------
--- Monica ---
It was hard to stay collected
He was so much better than expected
And it might just be a whim
But I think I could go faster with him
--- Unknown ---
Every night I'm pacing in my moon-stroom room
And I think we can all presume
I'm pacing to the pulsing of my heart convulsing
--- Unknown ---
Buzz! Bang! Crash! Wizzle-sizzle!
onomatopoeias all around me
Slum-pup, can't stop my head exploding
I am seriously overloading
--- Unknown ---
Bring the future faster
Bring the future faster
--- Unknown ---
Deep in the dark of the heart of the night
My head is racing, pacing, a nerve and speaking
Relatively speaking
Don't know what I feel, but I know it's real
--- Unknown ---
I'm wearing a hole in the floor
So open up the door and let me out this room
And soon
And soon
--- Unknown ---
Bring the future faster
Bring the future faster
--- Unknown ---
Give me the new thing
The next thing
That's always the best thing
A new view
I have to breakthrough
To something new
To something new
The universe is spinning
With another new beginning
--- Unknown ---
Bring the future faster
Would you bring the future faster
All I want is everything
All I want is me
