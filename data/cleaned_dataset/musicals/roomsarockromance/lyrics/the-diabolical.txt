------ The Diabolical ------
--- Monica ---
Ten past ten, bloody late again
What am I meant to do with all this d’j’ vu’
--- Ian ---
Sorry, I lost track of time
Downtown bars and happy hours
I caught a cab to be with you
I’ll never leave you lonely, superstar
--- Monica ---
Ian’where is your guitar’
--- Ian ---
Oh, Jesus mother of Mary
Holy Virgin Christ, it’s in the taxi!
--- Monica ---
Schmuck!
--- Ian ---
Fuck!
I gotta find it
Wait for me
--- Monica ---
We’re on in three!
--- Ian ---
I’ll be right back!
Trust me, do
--- Monica ---
Me trust you’!
What an epic farce
I’ll be falling on my arse
How allegorical
A solo diabolical
I’ve never been put off before
I never have been spat upon on stage
I’ve never failed, but tonight I might be nailed
--- Announcer ---
CBGB’S welcomes all the way from the U.K’The Diabolicals!
--- Monica ---
All I want is everything
All I want is me
All I want is whatever it takes
Here I go
