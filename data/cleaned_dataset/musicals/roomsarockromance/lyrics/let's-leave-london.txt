------ Let's Leave London ------
--- Monica ---
That was Percy Parker, Rip Off Records just got bought
By E.M.I America, I’m weak at the knees
We’re getting a gig at C.B.G.B’s
--- Unknown ---
We’re leaving London
We’re going to New York
The record company’s paying for the bubbly
So let’s pop that cork
Everything we ever wanted on a silver platter
--- Ian ---
Everything you wanted
--- Monica ---
Everything we wanted
Let’s get there now
--- Ian ---
I’ve been asking myself, ‘Why am I here’’ I don’t care about celebrity and world tours.
--- Monica ---
What do you care about then’
--- Ian ---
Jesus, Monica.
--- Monica ---
Shivers down my spine
--- Ian ---
Time to cross a line
--- Monica ---
Goosebumps on my skin
--- Ian ---
Something’s beginning
--- Monica ---
I’m scared.
--- Ian ---
I’m scared too.
--- Monica ---
You are’
--- Ian ---
Of flying.
--- Monica ---
Metaphorically’
--- Ian ---
Literally. I’m scared of flying.
--- Monica ---
You can hold my hand.
--- Both ---
Just two punks in love
--- Ian ---
Bound for New York City
--- Monica ---
Yes!
--- Both ---
Two young punks in love
In love
--- Monica ---
You go like this
--- Ian ---
You go like that
--- Monica ---
You blow a kiss
--- Ian ---
You tip your hat
--- Monica ---
You rip your shirt
--- Ian ---
Unzip your fly
--- Monica ---
You grab a plane and
--- Both ---
Wave U.K. goodbye
Goodbye
