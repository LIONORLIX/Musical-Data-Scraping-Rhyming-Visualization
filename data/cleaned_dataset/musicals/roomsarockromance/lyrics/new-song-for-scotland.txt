------ New Song For Scotland ------
--- Ian ---
Today I sing a new song for Scotland
A new song to celebrate
The land that I love
--- Monica ---
Today I bring a new song for Scotland
A new song for anyone who?s been dreaming on
--- Ian ---
A misty mountain weather
--- Monica ---
The whiskey southern heaven
--- Ian ---
There?s a brand new day again
--- Both ---
There?s a brand new day beginning
And that?s why I?m singing
A new song for Scotland
A new song for Scotland
Land that I love
