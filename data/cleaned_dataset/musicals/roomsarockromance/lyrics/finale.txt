--- Ian ---
Let’s get out this room
Out into the dawn
New York City
Back where we belong
--- Monica ---
It’s the songs that shape our lives
--- Ian ---
The tune that form our trips
--- Both ---
The melody of memory
That clings and sings and grips
Wherever I may go now
Wherever we may go
The room where you are is the room where I’m home
And when world’s disappear
--- Ian ---
Na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na
--- Both ---
Na-na-na-na
I’ll be waiting right here
I love you for all time
--- Ian ---
Na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na
--- Both ---
I love you for all time
--- Ian ---
Na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na
--- Both ---
I love you for all time
