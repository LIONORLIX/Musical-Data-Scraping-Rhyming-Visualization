She's not a girl, who nurses much
Do do do do do do-Oh yeah
She's well acquainted with the touch of a velvet hand
like a lizard on a window pane

the man in the crowd with the multicolored mirrors and his hobnail boots
Lion  with his eyes while his hands are busy working overtime
a soap impression of his wife which he ate and donated to the national trust

I need a fix 'cause im going down
down to the pits that left uptown
i need a fix 'cause im going down
mother superior jumped the gun
mother superior jumped the gun
mother superior jumped the gun
mother superior jumped the gun
mother superior jumped the gun
mother superior jumped the gun
