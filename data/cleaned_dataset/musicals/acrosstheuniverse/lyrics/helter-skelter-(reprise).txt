------ Helter Skelter (Reprise) ------
--- Unknown ---
When I get to the bottom
I go back to the top of the slide
Where I stop and turn and I go for a ride
Till I get to the bottom and I see you again
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Do you, don't you want me to love him
I'm coming down fast but I'm miles above you
Tell me, tell me, tell me, come on tell me the answer
Well you may be a lover but you ain't no dancer
--- Unknown ---
Look out
Helter skelter
Helter skelter
Helter skelter
Uhhhhh
Will you won't you want me to make you
I'm coming down fast but don't let me break you
Tell me, tell me, tell me, baby tell me the answer
You may be a lover but you ain't no dancer
