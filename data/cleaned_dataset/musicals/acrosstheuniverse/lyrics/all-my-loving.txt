------ All My Loving ------
--- Unknown ---
Close your eyes and I'll kiss you,
Tomorrow I'll miss you;
Remember I'll always be true.
And then while I'm away,
I'll write home ev'ry day,
And I'll send all my lovin'to you.
--- Unknown ---
I'll pretend that I'm kissing
The lips I am missing
And hope that my dreams will come true.
And then while I'm away,
I'll write home ev'ry day,
And I'll send all my lovin'to you.
--- Unknown ---
All my lovin' I will send to you.
All my lovin' darling I'll be true.
