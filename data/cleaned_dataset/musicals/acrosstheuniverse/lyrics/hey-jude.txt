------ Hey Jude ------
--- Unknown ---
Hey Jude, don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better
--- Unknown ---
Hey Jude, don't be afraid
You were made to go out and get her
The minute you let her under your skin
Then you begin to make it better
--- Unknown ---
Anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude refrain
Don't carry the world upon your shoulders
Well, you know that it's a fool who plays it cool
By making it a little colder
Na na na na na na na na na

--- Unknown ---
You have found her now go and get her
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better better better better better better Whooooooooo
