------ If I Fell ------
--- Unknown ---
If I fell in love with you,
Would you promise to be true
And help me understand.
--- Unknown ---
Cause I've been in love before
And I've found that love was more,
Than just holding hands.
--- Unknown ---
If I give my heart to you,
I must be sure from the very start
That you would love me more than her.
--- Unknown ---
If I trust in you,
Oh please, don't run and hide.
If I love you too,
Oh please, don't hurt my pride like her,
--- Unknown ---
Cause I couldn't stand the pain.
And I, would be sad if our new love was in vain,
So I hope you see,
That I would love to love you.
