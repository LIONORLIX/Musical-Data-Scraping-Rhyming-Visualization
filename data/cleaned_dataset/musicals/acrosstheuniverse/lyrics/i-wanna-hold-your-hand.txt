------ I Wanna Hold Your Hand ------

Yeah, I’ll tell you something
I think you’ll understand
When I say that something
I wanna hold your hand
I wanna hold your hand
I wanna hold your hand

Oh, please, say to me
You’ll let me be your man
and please, say to me
--- Unknown ---
You’ll let me hold your hand
Now let me hold your hand
I wanna hold your hand
--- Unknown ---
And when I touch you I feel happy, inside
It’s such a feeling
That my love
I can’t hide
I can’t hide
I can’t hide
--- Unknown ---
Yeah you, got that something
I think you’ll understand
When I feel that something
I wanna hold your hand
I wanna hold your hand
I wanna hold your hand
--- Unknown ---
I wanna hold your hand.
