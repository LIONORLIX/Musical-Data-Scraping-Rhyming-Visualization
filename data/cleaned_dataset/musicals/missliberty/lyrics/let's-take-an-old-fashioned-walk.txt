------ Let's Take an Old Fashioned Walk ------
--- Unknown ---
Some couples go for a buggy ride
When they start caring a lot
Others will bicycle side by side
Out to some romantic spot
But when you haven't a sou
There's only one thing to do
--- Unknown ---
Let's take an old-fashioned walk
I'm just bursting with talk
What a tale could be told
If we went for an old-fashioned walk
--- Unknown ---
Let's take a stroll through the park
Down a lane where it's dark
And heart that's controlled
May relax on an old-fashioned walk
--- Unknown ---
I know for a couple who seem to be miles apart
There's nothing like walking and having a heart to heart
--- Unknown ---
I know a girl who declined
Couldn't make up her mind
She was wrapped up and sold
Coming home from an old-fashioned walk

I used to dream of a millionaire
Handsome and rich from the States
Taking me out for a breath of air
Saying The carriage awaits
But since you haven't a sou
