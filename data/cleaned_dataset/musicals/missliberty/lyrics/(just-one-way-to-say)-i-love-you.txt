------ (Just One Way to Say) I Love You ------
--- Unknown ---
Why search for flowery phrases
Quoting what poets have said
Why talk in circles around it
Why not be simple instead
Let's hit the nail on the head
--- Unknown ---
I love you, I love you
There's no other way
Just one way to say
I love you
--- Unknown ---
I love you, I love you
And try as I may
That's all I can say
I love you
--- Unknown ---
Much more could be said if I thought with my head
But I only can think with my heart
--- Unknown ---
I love you, I love you
And yearn for the day
The day when you'll say
I love you

I could be oh, so indiff'rent
With very little success
I could continue pretending
But I'm afraid you would guess
So why not simply say, Yes?
--- Unknown ---
I love you, I love you
There's no other way
Just one way to say
I love you
--- Unknown ---
I love you, I love you
And try as I may
That's all I can say
I love you
--- Unknown ---
Much more could be said if I thought with my head
But I only can think with my heart
--- Unknown ---
I love you, I love you
And this is the day
The day when we'll say
