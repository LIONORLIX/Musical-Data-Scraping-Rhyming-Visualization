------ Homework ------
--- Unknown ---
I'm so tired of working in an office
And it's making me blue
There is work that don't require an office
That I'm anxious to do
--- Unknown ---
Homework, I want to do homework
Instead of an office, I want to work home
--- Unknown ---
Staying at home and crocheting
And meekly obeying
The guy who comes home
--- Unknown ---
A cozy kitchen to be in there pitchin'
Is the thing I'm longing to do
To be there learning when a steak needs turning
And just what goes into a stew
--- Unknown ---
Homework, I want to do homework
A genius who sits and plans with pots and pans at home
A genius who bakes a pie that keeps a guy at home

Homework, I want to do homework
Instead of an office, I want to work home
--- Unknown ---
Messing around with French dressing
And slightly impressing
The guy who comes home
--- Unknown ---
I long to settle with a steaming kettle
And a frying pan and a pot
And be the keeper of a carpet sweeper
That's the one ambition I've got
--- Unknown ---
Homework, I want to do homework
A genius who has a way that makes him stay at home
A genius who has what takes that makes or breaks a home

Homework, I want to do homework
Instead of an office, I want to work home
--- Unknown ---
Patching his trousers and matching
The part that keeps scratching
The guy who comes home
--- Unknown ---
A table wiper who can change a diaper
Is the thing I'd like to be best
And be the master of a mustard plaster
When the cold goes down to his chest
--- Unknown ---
Homework, I want to do homework
A genius who does her part so he don't start to roam
