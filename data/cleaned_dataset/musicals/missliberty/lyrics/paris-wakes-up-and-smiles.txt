------ Paris Wakes up and Smiles ------
--- Unknown ---
When the sun goes down
Paris wakes up
Fills up her cup
And smiles
--- Unknown ---
When the lights are low
Paris is high
Lights up the sky
For miles
--- Unknown ---
When they stop playing shop on the Rue de la Paix
Count their stock and they lock up their styles
--- Unknown ---
When the busy town
Goes home to sup
Paris wakes up
