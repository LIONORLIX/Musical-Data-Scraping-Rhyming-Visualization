------ Little Fish in a Big Pond ------
--- Horace: ---
A little fish in a big pond has plenty of room to swim
But swimming around are big fish all ready to pounce on him
--- Unknown ---
Back to his little pond he starts to roam
The little fish spreads his fins and begins to swim back home
--- Unknown ---
That's me, a little fish in a big pond, all wrong
That's me, a little fish where a little fish don't belong
--- Unknown ---
A little man in a big town gets butterflies in his dome
I'm ready to spread my fin and begin to swim back home
To the little pond where a little fish and a little man belong
--- Maizie: ---
A little fish in a big pond has gotta have lots of heart
For swimming around are big fish, but if he's the least bit smart
--- Unknown ---
Back to his little pond he doesn't go
The little fish spreads his fins and begins to grow, grow, grow
--- Unknown ---
That's you, a little fish in a big pond, all right
Me too, a little fish, but we gotta stand up and fight
--- Unknown ---
A little man in a big town don't have to get out and roam
Stop taking it on the chin and begin to feel at home
