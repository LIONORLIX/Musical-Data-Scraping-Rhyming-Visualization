------ Most Expensive Statue in the World ------
--- Unknown ---
Citizens of New York, I greet you
With the hundred thousand dollar check
The money that my readers have contributed
For the pedestal of the statue
--- Unknown ---
Citizens of New York, I greet you
With the news that soon our flag will be unfurled
On the most expensive statue in the world
-On the most expensive statue in the world

When it's finally installed, tell us, what will it be called?
-When it's finally installed, tell us, what will it be called?
When we finally install it
What's the diff'rence what we call it?
It's the best that money can buy
And will stand three hundred feet high
And I understand before we're through the cost may not be known
A hundred thousand dollars for the pedestal alone
And our flag will soon be unfurled
On the most expensive statue in the world
-On the most expensive statue in the world

When it finally is claimed, tell us, what will it be named?
-When it finally is claimed, tell us, what will it be named?
When at last we come to claim it
What's the diff'rence what we name it?
What's important is the expense
What it means in dollars and cents
From the French across the ocean it was sent to me and you
And now I'd like to call upon and hear a word or two
From our friend the French ambassador
--- Unknown ---
Your honor, I speak not for my government, but my people
For it is not my government, but my people who give this statue
Creation of the genius of Bartholdi
May it arise in your harbor and give the light of
Liberty, equality, fraternity
--- Unknown ---
Finally, when we install it, why don't we call it "Liberty"?
The Statue of Liberty!
-The Statue of Liberty!
And the most expensive statue in the world!
