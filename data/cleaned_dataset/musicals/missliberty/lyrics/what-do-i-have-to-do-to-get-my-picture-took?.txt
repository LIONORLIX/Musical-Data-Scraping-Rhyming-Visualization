------ What Do I Have to Do to Get My Picture Took? ------
--- Unknown ---
I'd like my picture took
What do I have to do to get my picture took?
Who do I have to be to get my picture took with you?
--- Unknown ---
I'd like to spark with you
Having a plate develop in the dark with you
Nothing I wouldn't do to get my picture took with you
--- Unknown ---
Me sittin' down, you standin' up
Lookin' at the birdie will be fun
Hands in my lap, yours on your chest
Just like Napoleon
--- Unknown ---
And someday we'll take a look
Into a fam'ly album or a mem'ry book
'Stead of a boring evening, we'll be laughing at
