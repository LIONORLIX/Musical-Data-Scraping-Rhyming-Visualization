------ Perspective ------
--- Sipos, spoken ---
I'm an idiot. But at least I'm an idiot with a job.

(sung)
Call me fool,
That's alright with me.
Here's my rule,
Never disagree.
Where's my pride?
Swallowed long ago.
Deep inside,
Where it doesn't show.
Bowing, scraping, nodding, beaming
Always humble
Not an ounce of self respect.
Yes sir, yes sir, you're so right sir
Black is white sir
'Scuse me while I genuflect.
How do I remain so calm and cheerful?
How do I retain my piece of mind?
Let me just explain my rationale
It's all in your perspective.
Listen! Listen!
To an old Hungarian's philosophy.

(singing dialogue)
I am only one of
several in a rather small parfumerie.
Which is only one of several in this city.
Which is one of many cities in this country which
Is only one
Of many countries
Which are on this continent
Which is only one of seven on this not so special planet
Which is one of several in our solar system
Which is only one of many solar systems
In this vast, and inconievable affair, that is the universe
Sooooooo
In this infinite, incomprehensible scheme
If a dot called Maraczek should scream
At a speck called Sipos
What on Earth does it matter?
Sooooo

(regular singing)
Call me fool,
That's alright with me.
Here's my rule,
Never disagree.
Where's my pride?
Swallowed long ago.
Deep inside,
Where it doesn't show.
Just maintain a true perspective
And it's easy to avoid a clash of wills
Just maintain a true perspective.
And make sure you're well supplied with stomach pills.
Let me put it bluntly,
I'm a coward.
With a wife and children to support.
Actually my creed is sort and simple
Five essential words Georg:
Do not
Lose
