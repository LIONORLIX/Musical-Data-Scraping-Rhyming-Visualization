(spoken) Dear Friend
--- Unknown ---
(sung)I am so sorry about last night
It was a nightmare in every way
But together you and I
Will laugh at last night some day
--- Unknown ---
Ice Cream
He brought me Ice Cream
Vanilla Ice Cream
Imagine that
--- Unknown ---
Ice Cream
And for the first time
We were together
Without a spat
--- Unknown ---
Friendly
He was so friendly
That isn't like him
I'm simply stunned
--- Unknown ---
Will wonders never cease
Will wonders never cease
It's been a most peculiar day
Will wonders never cease
Will wonders never cease
--- Unknown ---
(spoken) Oh yes, where was I..
--- Unknown ---
(sung) I am so sorry about last night
It was a nightmare in everyway
But together you and I
Will laugh at last night some day
I sat there waiting at that cafe
And never guessing that you were fat
...that you were near
You were outside looking bald
(spoken) Oh dear..
(sung) I am so sorry about last night
--- Unknown ---
Last Night
I was so nasty
Well he deserved it
But even so
--- Unknown ---
That Georg
Is not like this Georg
This is a new Georg
I just don't know
--- Unknown ---
Somehow
It all reminds me
Of Dr. Jekyll
And Mr. Hyde
--- Unknown ---
Well right before my eyes
A man that I dispise
Has turned into a man I like
It's almost like a dream
And strange at it may seem
He came to offer me
Vanilla Ice Cream
