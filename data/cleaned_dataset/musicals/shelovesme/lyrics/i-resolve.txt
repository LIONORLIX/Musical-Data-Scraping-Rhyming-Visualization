------ I Resolve ------
--- ILONA ---
I resolve not to be so stupid,
I resolve not to play these games,
How often I've been a sitting duck for cupid,
How often I've let him shoot me down in flames,
--- Unknown ---
I resolve not to be so trusting,
It's high time, time that I awoke,
Whatever I've got up here is up here rusting,
My feminine intuition is a joke,
--- Unknown ---
I must be cousin to a cat,
I always wind up with a rat,
I'm through with momentary thrills,
I find I can't afford the bills!
--- Unknown ---
I resolve,
Come what may,
I will not be this girl one more day,
--- Unknown ---
I resolve not be so brainless,
I resolve not to be so dumb,
My usual brush with love is far from painless,
And suddenly I have got to know how come,
--- Unknown ---
I resolve not to blame the others,
Just because I'm an easy mark,
I wanna know why I never meet their mothers,
Where men are concerned I'm always in the dark,
--- Unknown ---
I must stop thinking with my skin,
I will not be a mandolin,
That someone strums and puts away,
Until he gets the urge to play,
--- Unknown ---
I resolve,
Here and Now,
I will be a different girl,
