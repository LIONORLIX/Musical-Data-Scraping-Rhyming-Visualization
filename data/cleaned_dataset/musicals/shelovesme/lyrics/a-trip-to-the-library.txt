------ A Trip To The Library ------
--- Unknown ---
"How did you like the library Ilona?"
--- Spoken ---
--- Unknown ---
You've never seen such a place
So many books
So much marble
So quiet
--- Sung ---
And suddenly all of my confidence dribbled away with a pitiful plop
My head was beginning to swim and my forehead was covered in cold perspiration
I started to reach for a book and my hand automatically came to a stop
I don't know how long I stood frozen a victim of panic and mortification
--- Unknown ---
Oooooh, how I wanted to flee
When a quiet voice, a gentle voice, whispered, Pardon me
--- Unknown ---
"Pardon me?"
--- Unknown ---
Uh huh
--- Unknown ---
And there was this dear, sweet, clearly respectable thickly bespectacled man
Who stood by my side and quietly sad to me - mam', don't mean to intrude,
but I was just ondering are you need of some help,
I said no, yes I am.
--- Unknown ---
The next thing you know I'm sipping hot chocolate and telling my troubles to Paul
Whose tender brown eyes kept sending compassionate looks
A trip to the library has made a new girl of me.
For suddenly I can see, the magic of books!
I have to admit in the back of my mind I was praying he wouldn't get fresh
And all of the while I was wondering why an illiterate girl should attract him
Then all of a sudden he said that I couldn't go wrong with the way of all flesh
Of course it's a novel, but I didn't know or I certainly wouldn't have smacked him!
Well he gave me a smile that I couldn't resist
And I knew at once how much I liked this
Optometrist

"Optometrist?"
--- Unknown ---
Optometrist

You know what this dear, sweet, slightly bespectacled gentlemen said to me next?
He said he could solve this problem of mine
I said, how?
He said, if I'd like he'd willingly read to me some of his favorite things, I said when?
He said now
His novel approach seamed highly suspicious and possibly dangerous too,
I told myself, wait, hing, dare you go up to his flat?
--- Unknown ---
What happens if things go wrong,
It's obvious he's quite strong,
He read to me all night long.
--- Unknown ---
Now how about that!
--- Unknown ---
It's hard to believe how truly domestic and happily hopeful I feel
I picture my Paul there reading aloud as I cook.
As long as he's there to read, there's quite a good chance indeed,
a chance that I'll never eed to open a book.
Unlike someone else
Someone I dimly recall.
I know he'll only have eyes for me
