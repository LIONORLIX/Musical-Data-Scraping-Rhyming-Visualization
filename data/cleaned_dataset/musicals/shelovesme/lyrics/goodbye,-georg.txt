Sorry to see you go

If I can ever help

Unusual perfume?
Something rather chic
But inexpensive.
That will make a
Lovely Christmas gift

Kind that I'm after

Do you have a lipstick
Guaranteed kiss proof?
Coconut oil

Goodbye Georg

What kind of mascara?

Your vanishing cream
And a bottle of your best

And can you wrap it as a gift and
Send it?

And thank you very very much
It's always such a
Pleasure shopping here

I wish there
were time for a proper
farewell

goodbye Georg
So long
So long
Please keep in touch
Do keep in touch
