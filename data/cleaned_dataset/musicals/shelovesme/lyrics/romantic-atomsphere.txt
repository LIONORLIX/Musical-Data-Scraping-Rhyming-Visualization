Think of all the love affairs we assist!
What more noble calling is there than ours?
Tending each new beautiful bud of love,
making sure each delicate seedling flowers.

Treat each trist and rondevouz as your own,
bearing in mind the gravity of your task.
All these lovers want is one shining hour,

That's why we have got to preserve a romantic atmosphere!
