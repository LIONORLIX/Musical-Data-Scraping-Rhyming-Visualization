Amalia: (Spoken) So you've come to see if I'm really sick!  Is that it?
--- Unknown ---
George: (Spoken) No! no
--- Amalia ---
So you can tell everyone there's not a thing wrong with me (no,no,no)
That I just don't care about my job! (No, no..I)
Well Mr. Nowack, you're not going to have that chance!
What time is it? (What?) I won't be very late....
--- Unknown ---
(Sung) Where's my other shoe, help me find my other shoe!
Don't just stand there like that where's my shoe
--- Unknown ---
Help me find my other shoe,
I can't leave until I do.
Will you give me my hat where's my shoe?
I hate to disappoint you, now that you've got your hopes up;
thrilled to be doing something mean! (Miss Balash do be sensible)
Just tell me if it's cold out, come help me pick a sweater,
I can't decide on white or green....
--- Unknown ---
Where'd you put my shoe? That's a sneaky thing to do!
You don't want me to go do you?
I can see right through you!
Where's my shoe?
You shouldn't be on your feet!
Where's my shoe?
Be a good girl and go
My right....
Back To....

If I were a shoe, where would I have gotten to?
Now, if I were a shoe I'd be there! (Please Miss Balash lie down!)
Is it very cold?  Yes, you told me it was cold.
Tell me what kind of dress should I wear? (You've a fever I think)
--- Unknown ---
I couldn't wear a sweater, that wouldn't fit my mood now.
I feel like wearing something gay!
I'm feeling so much better, I feel so gay and giddy!
One shoe and I'll be on my way....
--- Unknown ---
Hahahaha see? There is nothing wrong with me!
I am going you can't stop me! Stop it now please drop me!
--- Unknown ---
Put me down!
Where's my shoe?
