------ Tonight At Eight ------
--- GEORG ---
I'm nervous and upset
Because this girl I've never met
I get to meet
Tonight at eight.
I'm taking her for dinner to
A charming old cafe, but who
Can eat
Tonight at eight?
It's early in the morning,
And our date is not till eight o'clock tonight,
And yet already I can see
What a nightmare this whole day will be.
I haven't slept a wink,
I only think
Of our approaching tete-a-tete,
Tonight at eight.
I feel a combination
Of depression and elation;
What a state!
To wait
Till eight!
Three more minutes, two more seconds, ten more hours to go!
In spite of what I've written,
She may not be very smitten,
And my hopes, perhaps,
May all collapse,
Kaput--tonight at eight.
--- Unknown ---
I wish I knew exact-
Ly how I'll act
And what will happen when we dine
Tonight at eight.
I know I'll drop the sil-
Verware, but will
I spill the water or the wine
Tonight at eight?
Tonight I'll walk right up and sit right down
Beside the smartest girl in town
And then it's anybody's guess.
More and more I'm breathing less and less!
In my imagination
I can hear our conversation
Taking shape
Tonight at eight.
I'll sit there saying absolutely nothing
Or I'll jabber like an ape
Tonight at eight!
Two more minutes, three more seconds, ten more hours to go!
I'll know, when this is done,
If something's ended or begun,
And if it goes
All right,
Who knows?
I might
Propose
Tonight
