------ Dear Freind ------
--- Unknown ---
The flowers, the linen, the crystal I see
Were carefully chosen for people like me.
The silver agleam and the candles aglow...your favorite songs on request.
--- Unknown ---
Each colorful touch in the finest of taste,
and notice how subtly the tables are spaced.
The music is muted, the lighting is low; no wonder I feel so depressed.
--- Unknown ---
Charming, romantic, the perfect cafe
Then as if it isn't bad enough a violin starts to play
Candles and wine, tables for two, but where are you dear friend?
--- Unknown ---
Couples go past me, I see how they look.
So discreetly sympathetic when they see the rose and the book.
I make believe nothing is wrong, how long can I pretend?
Please make it right, don't break my heart, don't let it end, dear friend.
