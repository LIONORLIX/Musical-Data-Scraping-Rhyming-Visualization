------ A Couple of Regular Guys ------
--- MITCH ---
There's a house in my hometown
I already put a payment down
It's not so grand, the perfect size
For a couple of regular guys
--- Unknown ---
I'll make some dough and we'll make do
Give it a paint job: navy blue
I'll even add a patio
For a sexy ex-G.I. I'll know
--- Unknown ---
I know it's difficult to imagine it now
Here in a world that's goping mad
But picture the two fo us
On some lazy day
When bombs away
Is just a game kids play
--- Unknown ---
And late at night when we're alone
Neighbors in houses of their own
We'll thank this goddamn war for having met
As happy and secure and financially set
As a couple of regular guys can get
--- STU ---
Every Saturday we can load up the car
--- MITCH ---
Beach is a simple drive away
--- STU ---
We'll have your family 'round
For cake and Cokes
--- MITCH ---
Though we'll shock my folks
With all our... army jokes
--- Unknown ---
And late some night
As records play
Couple'a dozen years away
We'll laugh about the battles
