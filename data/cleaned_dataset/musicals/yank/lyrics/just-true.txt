------ Just True ------

Don't run away Mitch
You can't outrun this
Run from me if you feel you have to...
You can't run from you
--- Unknown ---
Don't you see?
What he have... is special
What we are is not
--- Unknown ---
We're two of thousands
Hundreds of thousands
I'm surprised as you
It isn't something good... or bad...
Just true
--- Unknown ---
Listen Mitch
We're in a battle we never planned
But we're together
Fighting together, that's what people do
Which isn't right or wrong
Just something true
--- Unknown ---
No going back, not now
Too many know to go back and hide
To go back in disguise
Hundreds of thousands
Who felt lost and alone before
Have found each other in the war
Now we're wise
The freaks are us
Us regular guys!
--- Unknown ---
You can't unlearn what you know is true
I'm glad they see us
If they can see us means that we can too
They'll have to understand
We've earned our due
And that's just true
