------ Something Different (Reprise) ------
--- DINA ---
Is it a hymn?
Is it a love song?
The music is so beautiful
It melts away so quickly
And you're standing in the silence
Standing in the darkness
Singing about wishes
--- Unknown ---
Every day, you stare to the west, to the south
You can see for miles, but it all stays the same
