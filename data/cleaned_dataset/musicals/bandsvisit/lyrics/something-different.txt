------ Something Different ------
--- DINA ---
Is this a hymn?
Is this a love song?
Something ancient by a poet
Maybe Hafiz, maybe Rumi?
--- Unknown ---
Is he singing about two hearts searching in the darkness?
Or is he singing about fishing?
--- Unknown ---
The tune seems sad, but are the words sad?
What's he saying?
Is he praying?
And why do the words get to me?
--- Unknown ---
Is he lonely? Maybe reaching out for someone?
Look at me. Maybe I'm the one who's fishing
--- Unknown ---
Every day you stare to the west, to the south
You can see for miles, but things never change
Then honey in your ears, spice in your mouth
Nothing's as surprising as the taste of something strange
--- Unknown ---
And here's this man
Right here beside me
Kind of deep and kind of cute
In his Sergeant Pepper suit
--- Unknown ---
Is this my sheikh?
Is this my Omar Sharif?
--- Unknown ---
Well, I know it's something different
--- TEWFIQ ---
Itgara'a...
--- They sing together ---
--- DINA ---
Who is this man right here beside me?
Closer by an inch or two, my cheek would touch his ear
What is he thinking? What does he wish for?
Is he singing about wishing?
--- Unknown ---
Something new I've never seen before
Through these walls I build, these gates I protect
Something new I didn't notice I was hoping for
Nothing is as beautiful as something that you don't expect
--- Unknown ---
Look at those hands
Those are not young hands
But they move like they are swimming through the music
Through the music
And I don't know what I feel
And I don't know what I know
All I know is I feel something different
--- TEWFIQ ---
Itgara'a...
