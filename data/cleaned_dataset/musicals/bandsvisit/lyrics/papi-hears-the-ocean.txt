------ Papi Hears the Ocean ------
--- PAPI ---
I don't know, with the girls, I don't know what to do
I don't know where to start
I'm smarter up here than I am down here
And up here, I'm not too smart
--- Unknown ---
They might say one thing or another
They might have smiled at me once or twice
If they have breasts and they're not my mother
Then all I hear is- [he makes an ocean noise]
--- Unknown ---
And the hands get heavy, oh the hands
I don't know what to do with the hands or the feet
Frozen in fear like a deer with the lights
In their eyes in the middle of the street
--- Unknown ---
She might be wanting to get touchy-feely
She might be talking to me really nice
She might as well be speaking Swahili
'Cause all I hear is- [he makes an ocean noise]
--- Unknown ---
And my tongue gets big
And I can't move my knees
And my eyeballs freeze
And all I see's a tunnel
And there's cotton in my head
My legs are full of lead
And my brain goes deader than the Dead Sea
Dead, dead
--- Unknown ---
Dead in the mind and I find that I kind of
Go into an infantile trance
I'm peeing in my - not literally - peeing in my -
But, you know, I may as well be - peeing in my -
--- Unknown ---
Then I lose my wits
And my lights go off
I get all sticky in the pits
And I smell like falafel
And my ears get hot
And I feel real awful
And all I hear is-
--- Unknown ---
Dead, dead, dead!
Belly up, going round
Sinking down, down, down
Like a schmuck
--- Unknown ---
Dead in the head
Dead in the water
Dead in a magical sea
Full of suck!
--- Unknown ---
Go ahead and tell me I should keep on trying
Go ahead and tell me I should break the ice
I'll be standing here, deaf and dying
And all I'll hear is...
--- The sounds of the ocean ---
