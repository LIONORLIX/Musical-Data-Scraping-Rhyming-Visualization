------ Itzik's Lullaby ------
--- ITZIK ---
A great big house there is somewhere
That's filled with sun and lovely things
Inside the house, there is a room
A baby sleeps, a daddy sings
--- Unknown ---
Thank God, he is a lucky man
A busy man, a happy man
Thank God the gift was given him
To finish all the things he plans
--- Unknown ---
I'm sorry, son, I don't know why
This gift has not been given me
It makes no difference how I try
I end up drifting on the sea
--- Unknown ---
We fell in love, your mom and I
We made our plans and started life
But now we fight and back away
A loser and a loser's wife
--- Unknown ---
(CAMAL vocalizes)
--- ITZIK ---
I guess I am a patient man
I guess I am a gift to thee
A quiet room, a sleeping child
You need this gift if you're like me
--- Unknown ---
A great big house there is somewhere
That's full of sun and lovely things
Inside the house, there is a room
