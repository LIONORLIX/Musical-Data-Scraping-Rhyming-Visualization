------ Haled's Song About Love ------
--- HALED ---
Not break the ice
You melt the ice
You melt yourself
And soon you're all one puddle
--- Unknown ---
You talk, she talks
It's not about the conversation
The words are like your lips, are reaching out
To kiss the ear
--- Unknown ---
You're here, she's here
Two drops of water
The pull, the pull
Invisible, but really real
--- Unknown ---
Your eyes, her eyes
And soon, you're looking in a mirror
You realize you can't get nearer
You are both right there
--- Unknown ---
You glow, she glows
Two suns, no shadow
Your skin, her skin
And everything's alight
--- Unknown ---
No edge, no edge
No walls, no border
Two streams of water
That become the sea
--- HALED ---
The dance
--- Unknown ---
The dance
[PAPI]
--- Unknown ---
The dance
--- Unknown ---
The dance
[HALED]
You see the wind that moves the trees is
The algebra that moves your knees
Is written in her eyes
--- HALED ---
Her eyes
--- Unknown ---
Your eyes
[PAPI]
--- Unknown ---
Her eyes
--- Unknown ---
Your eyes
[BOTH]
You're only looking in a mirror
--- HALED ---
You realize you can't get nearer
