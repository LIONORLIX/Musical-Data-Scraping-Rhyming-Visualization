------ Just For Tonight ------
--- SONIA ---
Just for today let me love you
Just for tonight I’ll close my eyes
And when I open them my world will be alright
It couldn’t hurt anyone
It wouldn’t hurt anyone
--- Unknown ---
Just for today I want to hold you
Just for tonight you’ll be my dream
And when the morning comes to wake me that’s alright
It couldn’t hurt anyone
It wouldn’t hurt anyone
--- Unknown ---
Taking just one more chance
Tryin for some fun
Up to now my life’s been too much said too little done
--- Unknown ---
Just for today
I’ll be my feelings
And I know
They’ll lead me home
And if we both come back a little wiser
It couldn’t hurt anyone
It wouldn’t hurt anyone
It shouldn’t hurt anyone
Just for tonight
--- Unknown ---
Taking just one more chance
Tryin for some fun
Up to now my life’s been too much said too little done
--- Unknown ---
Just for today
I’ll be my feelings
And I know
They’ll lead me home
And if we both come back a little wiser
It couldn’t hurt anyone
It wouldn’t hurt anyone
It shouldn’t hurt anyone
Just for tonight
