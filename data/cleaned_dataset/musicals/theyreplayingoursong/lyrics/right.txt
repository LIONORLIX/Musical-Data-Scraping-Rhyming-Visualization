Everything about this feels write
Everything is perfectly fine at this minute
And this time I’m finding that light
Shining on me looking so bright
Feeling alive again
Making me sure that he’s more than alright for me

Telling me my heart wouldn’t lie to me
If I were to say in a word what I’m feeling tonight
