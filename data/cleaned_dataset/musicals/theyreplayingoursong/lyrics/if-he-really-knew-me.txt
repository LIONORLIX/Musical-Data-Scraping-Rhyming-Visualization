------ If He Really Knew Me ------
--- SONIA ---
If he really knew me
If he really truly knew me
Maybe he would see the other side of me I seldom see
--- Unknown ---
If there were no music
If the melodies stopped playing
Would he be the kind of man
I’d want to see tonight
--- Unknown ---
Does the man make the music
Or does the music make this man
And is he everything I thought he’d be
--- Unknown ---
If he really knew me
If he’d take the time to understand
Maybe he could find me
The part I left behind me
Maybe he’d remind me
Of who I am
--- VERNON ---
If there were no music
If my melodies stopped plain’
Would I be the kind of man she’d want to se tonight
What the hell
It’s just a dinner
If this doesn’t work, that’s it
And can I really be so hungry for a hit
--- Unknown ---
If she really knew me
If she’d take the time to understand
Maybe she could find me
The part I left behind me
Maybe she’d remind me
Of who I am
