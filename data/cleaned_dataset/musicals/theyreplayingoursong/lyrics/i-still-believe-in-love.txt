------ I Still Believe In Love ------
--- Unknown ---
After all the tears I’ve cried
You’d think I would give up on love
Get off the slide
Maybe I might get it right this time
--- Unknown ---
I was there as passion turned to pain
Sunshine turned to rainy days
Here I am
Ready to begin once again
--- Unknown ---
All my life I’ve been a dreamer
Dreaming’ dreams that always broke in two
But I still believe in love and love believing
Maybe you can make my dreams hold true
--- Unknown ---
He’s content with who I am
I’m reaching out my hand to him once again
At least I know I’ve made myself a friend
--- Unknown ---
All my life I’ve been a dreamer
Dreaming dreams that never quite came true
But I still believe in love and love believing
I’ll keep on dreaming because I still believe in love
I still believe in love
And me
And you
I still believe in love
