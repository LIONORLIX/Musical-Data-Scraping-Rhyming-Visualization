------ Falling ------
--- Unknown ---
I’m afraid to fly
And I don’t know why
I’m jealous of the people who
are not afraid to die
It’s just  that I recall
Back when I was small
Someone promised that they’d catch me
And then they let me fall
--- Unknown ---
And now I’m fallin’
Fallin’ fast again
Why do I always take a fall
When I fall in Love’
--- Unknown ---
You think by now I’d learn
Play with fire you get burned
But fire can be oh so warm
And that’s why I returned
Turn and walk away
That’s what I should do
My head says turn and walk away
My heart says I love you.
--- Unknown ---
And now I’m fallin’
Fallin’ fast again
Why do I always take a fall
When I fall in Love’
--- Unknown ---
Always turns out the same
Lovin’ someone
Confusin’ myself
Only got me to nlame
Helkp me I’m fallin Fallin
Catch me if you can
Maybe this time I’ll have it all
Maybe I’ll make it after all
Maybe this time I won’t fall
When I fall in love.
