------ All That's Known ------
--- Unknown ---
All that's known
In History, in Science
Overthrown
At school, at home, by blind men
--- Unknown ---
You doubt them
And soon they bark and hound you-
Till everything you say is just another bad about you
--- Unknown ---
All they say
Is Trust in What is Written
Wars are made
And somehow that is wisdom
--- Unknown ---
Thought is suspect
And money is their idol
And nothing is okay unless it's scripted in their Bible
--- Unknown ---
But I know
There's so much more to find-
Just in looking through myself
And not at them
--- Unknown ---
Still, I know
To trust my own true mind
And to say: there's a way through this
--- Unknown ---
On I go
To wonder and to learning
Name the stars and know their dark returning
--- Unknown ---
I'm calling
To know the world's true yearning-
The hunger that a child feels for everything they're shown
--- Unknown ---
You watch me-
Just watch me-
I'm calling
And one day all will know
--- Unknown ---
You watch me-
Just watch me-
I'm calling, I'm calling.
