------ The Song of Purple Summer ------
--- Unknown ---
And all shall fade
The flowers of spring
The world and all the sorrows
At the heart of everything
--- Unknown ---
But still it stays
The butterfly sings
And opens purple summer
With a flutter of its wings
--- Unknown ---
The earth will wave with corn
The grey-fly choir will mourn
And mare will neigh
With stallions that they mate
Foals they've born
--- Unknown ---
And all shall know the wonder of purple summer.....
--- Unknown ---
And yet i wait
The swallow brings
A song too hard to follow
That no one else can sing
--- Unknown ---
The fences sway
The porches swing
The clouds begin to thunder
Crickets wander murmuring
--- Unknown ---
The earth will wave with corn
The grey-fly choir will mourn
And mares with neigh
With stallions that they mate
Foals they've born
--- Unknown ---
And all shall know the wonder
I will sing the song of purple summer.
--- Unknown ---
And all shall know the wonder
I will sing the song of purple summer.
--- Unknown ---
All shall know the wonder of purple summer.....
