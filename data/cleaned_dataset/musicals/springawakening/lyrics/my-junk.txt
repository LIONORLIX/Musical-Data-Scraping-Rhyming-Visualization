------ My Junk ------
--- WENDLA ---
In the midst of this nothing. This miss of a life.
Still there's this one thing just to see you go by.
--- MARTHA ---
It's almost like lovin'. Sad as that is.
--- THEA ---
May not be cool, but it's so where I live.
--- ANNA ---
It's like i'm your lover or more like your ghost.
I spend the day wondering what you do, where you go.
--- THEA ---
I try and just kick it but then what can I do?
We've all got our junk, and my junk is you.
--- ALL GIRLS ---
See us, winter walking after a storm.
It's chill in the wind but it's warm in your arms.
We stop all snow blind, may not be true
We've all got our junk, and my junk is you.
--- GEORG ---
Well, you?ll have to excuse me, I know it?s so off.
I love when you do stuff that?s rude and so wrong.
--- HANSCHEN ---
I go up to my room, turn the stereo on?
Shoot up some you in the you of some song.
--- THEA ---
I lie back just driftin' and play out these scenes
I ride on the rush all the hopes all the dreams.
--- ANNA ---
I May be neglecting the things I should do.
We've all got our junk, and my junk is you.
--- ALL ---
See we still keep talkin' after you're gone.
You still with me then feels so good in my arms.
They say you go blind, maybe it's true.
We've all got our junk, and my junk is you.
--- Unknown ---
It's like we stop time. What can I do?
We've all got our junk, and my junk is you.
My junk is you.
My junk is you.
You. You. You.
