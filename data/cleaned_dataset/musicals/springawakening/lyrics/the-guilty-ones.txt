------ The Guilty Ones ------
--- WENDLA ---
Something’s started crazy
Sweet and unknown
--- Unknown ---
Something you keep
In a box on the street
Now it’s longing for a home
--- ALL ---
And who can say what dreams are?
--- WENDLA ---
Wake me in time to be lonely and sad
--- ALL ---
And who can say what we are?
--- WENDLA ---
This is the season for dreaming
--- Unknown ---
And now our bodies are the guilty ones
Who touch
And color the hours
--- Unknown ---
Night won’t breathe
Oh how we
Fall into silence from the sky
--- Unknown ---
And whisper some silver reply
--- MELCHIOR ---
Pulse is gone and racing
All fits and starts
--- Unknown ---
Window by window
You try and look into
This brave new you that you are
--- ALL ---
And who can say what dreams are?
--- MELCHIOR & WENDLA ---
Wake me in time to be out in the cold
--- ALL ---
And who can say what we are?
--- MELCHIOR & WENDLA ---
This is the reason for dreaming
--- ALL ---
And now our bodies are the guilty ones
Our touch
Will fill every hour
--- Unknown ---
Huge and dark
Oh our hearts
Will murmur the blues from on high
--- Unknown ---
Then whisper some silver reply
--- Unknown ---
And now our bodies are the guilty ones
Our touch
Will color hours
--- Unknown ---
Night won’t breathe
Oh how we
Fall in silence from the sky
--- Unknown ---
Then whisper some silver reply
