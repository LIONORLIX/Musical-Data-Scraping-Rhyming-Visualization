------ There Once Was a Pirate ------
--- Unknown ---
There once was a pirate
Who put out to sea
His mates all around him
No maiden on his knee
Oh sail for a little
A little little litte
Oh sail for a little
Til she finds him
--- Unknown ---
There once was a maiden
Who wandered the mead
To gather blue violets
Her mama would need
A wail through the willows
All hollow through the willows
She’ll wail through the willows
‘Til she finds him
--- Unknown ---
The sea was so violent
The crew went below
They begged him to join them
But he would not go
Oh sail a little little
For just a little little
Oh sail for a little
‘Til she finds him
--- Unknown ---
Her heart was so laden
She fell by a tree
Sang of some pirate
Who haunted the sea
A wail through the willows
All hollow through the willows
She’ll wail through the willows
‘Til she finds him
--- Unknown ---
A wail through the willows
All hollow through the willows
She’ll wail through the willows
‘Til she finds him
--- Unknown ---
He’ll sail for a little
A little little litte
He’ll sail for a little
‘Til she finds him
--- Unknown ---
He’ll sail for a little ‘til she finds him
