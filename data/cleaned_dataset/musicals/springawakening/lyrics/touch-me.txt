------ Touch Me ------
--- Melchior ---
Where I go, when i go there,
No more memory anymore-
Only men on distant ships,
The women with them, swimming with them, to shore...
--- Moritz ---
Where I go, when I go there,
No more whispering anymore-
Only hymns upon your lips;
A mystic wisdom, rising with them, to shore...
--- Ernst ---
Touch me-just like that.
And that-oh, yeah-now, that's heaven.
Now, that I like.
God that's so nice.
Now lower down, where the figs lie...
--- Unknown ---
Moritz: (Spoken)
Still, you must admit, with the two anatomies, it truly is daunting.
I mean how everything might..
--- Unknown ---
Melchior: (Spoken)
Measure up?
--- Unknown ---
Moritz: (Spoken)
Not that I'm saying I wouldn't...I wouldn't want to not...would ever not want to...
--- Unknown ---
Melchior: (Spoken)
Moritz?
--- Unknown ---
Moritz: (Spoken)
I have to go.
--- Unknown ---
Melchior: (Spoken)
Moritz, wait.
--- Otto ---
Where I go when I go there,
No more shadows anymore-
Only men with golden fins;
The rythm in them, rocking with them, to shore...
--- Georg ---
Where I go when I go there,
No more weeping anymore.
Only in and out your lips;
the broken wishes, washing with them, to shore.
--- All ---
Touch me-all silent.
Tell me-please-all is forgiven.
Consume my wine.
Consume my mind.
I'll tell you how, how the winds sigh...
--- Unknown ---
Touch me-just try it.
Now there-that's it-God that's heaven.
Touch me.
I'll love your light.
I'll love you right...
We'll wander down, where the sins lie...
--- Unknown ---
Touch me-just like that.
Now lower down, where the sins lie...
--- Unknown ---
Love me-just for bit...
We'll wander down, where the winds sigh...
Where the winds sigh...
Where the winds sigh...
