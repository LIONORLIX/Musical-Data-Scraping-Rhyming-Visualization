------ The Dark I Know Well ------
--- MARTHA ---
There is a part I can’t tell
About the dark I know well
--- Unknown ---
You say, ‘Time for bed now child,?
Mom just smiles that smile
Just like she never saw me
Just like she never saw me
--- Unknown ---
So, I leave, wanting to hide
Knowing deep inside
You are coming to me
You are coming to me
--- Unknown ---
You say all you want is just a kiss goodnight
And then you hold me and you whisper,
Child, the Lord won’t mind.
It’s just you and me.
Child, you’re a beauty.
--- Unknown ---
God, it’s good  the lovin’  ain’t it good tonight?
You ain’t seen nothing yet  gonna treat you right.
It’s just you and me
Child you’re a beauty.
--- ILSE ---
I don’t scream, though I know it’s wrong
I just play along
I lie there and breathe
Lie there and breathe
--- Unknown ---
I wanna be strong
I want the world to find out
That you’re dreamin’ on me
Me and my ‘beauty’
Me and my ‘beauty’
--- BOTH ---
You say all you want is just a kiss goodnight
And then you hold me and you whisper,
Child, the Lord won’t mind.
It’s just you and me.
Child, you’re a beauty.
--- Unknown ---
God, it’s good the lovin’ ain’t it good tonight?
You ain’t seen nothing yet gonna treat you right.
It’s just you and me
Child you’re a beauty.
