------ Mamma Who Bore Me (Reprise) ------
--- Unknown ---
Mama who bore me
Mama who gave me
Mama the angels
Who made me so sad
--- Unknown ---
Mama who bore me
Mama who gave me
No way to handle things
Who made me so sad
--- Unknown ---
Mama, the weeping
Mama, the angels
No sleep in Heaven, or Bethlehem
--- Unknown ---
Some pray that one day
Christ will come a'-callin'
They light a candle
And hope that it glows
And some just lie there
Crying for him to come and find them
But when he comes they don't know how to go
--- Unknown ---
Mama who bore me
Mama who gave me
Mama the angels
Who made me so bad
--- Unknown ---
Mama, the weeping
Mama, the angels
