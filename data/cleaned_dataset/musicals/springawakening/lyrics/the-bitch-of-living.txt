------ The Bitch of Living ------
--- Moritz ---
God, I dreamed there was an angel
Who could hear me through the wall
As I cried out-like, in Latin
This is so not life at all
Help me out-out-of this nightmare
Then I heard her silver call-
She said: Just give it time, kid
I come to one and all
--- Unknown ---
She said: "Give me that hand, please
And the itch you can't control
Let me teach you how to handle
All the sadness in your soul
Oh, we'll work that silver magic
Then we'll aim it at the wall
She said: Love may make you blind kid-
But I wouldn't mind at all
--- All ---
It's the bitch of living
With nothing but your hand
Just the bitch of living
As someone you can't stand
--- Georg ---
See, each night, it's like fantastic-
Tossing, turning, without rest
'Cause my days at the piano
With my teacher and her breasts;
And the music's like the one thing
I can even get at all
And those breasts!
I mean, God, please
Just let those apples fall
--- All ---
It's the bitch of living
With nothing going on
Just the bitch of living
Asking: what went wrong?
--- Unknown ---
Do they think we want this?
Oh- who knows?
--- Ernst ---
See, there's showering in gym class...
--- Hanschen ---
Bobby Maler, he's the best
Looks so nasty in those khakis
--- Ernst ---
God, my whole life's like some test
--- Otto ---
Then there's Marianna Wheelan
As if she'd return my call
--- Hanschen ---
It's like just kiss some ass, man
Then you can screw 'em all
--- All ---
Alllllllll
--- Melchior ---
It's the bitch of living
--- All ---
It's the bitch of living
--- Melchior ---
And living in your head
--- All ---
In your head
It's the bitch
--- Melchior ---
Of living
And sensing God is dead
--- All ---
It's the bitch of living
--- Melchior ---
You watch me-
Just watch me-
--- All ---
And trying to get ahead
--- Melchior ---
I'm calling you one day
--- All ---
It's the bitch of living
Just getting out of bed
--- Melchior ---
All will know
--- All ---
It's the bitch of living
Living, Living
--- Melchior ---
All will know
--- All ---
And getting what you get
Just the bitch of living
--- Melchior ---
And knowing this is it
--- All ---
God, is this it?
This can't be it
