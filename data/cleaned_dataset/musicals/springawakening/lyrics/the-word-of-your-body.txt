------ The Word of Your Body ------
--- WENDLA ---
Just too unreal, all this
Watching the words fall from my lips
--- MELCHIOR ---
Baiting some girl with hypotheses
--- BOTH ---
Haven’t you heard the word of your body?
--- MELCHIOR ---
Don’t feel a thing, you wish
--- WENDLA ---
Grasping at pearls with my fingertips
--- MELCHIOR ---
Holding her hand like some little tease
--- BOTH ---
Haven’t you heard the word of my wanting?
--- Unknown ---
O, I’m gonna be wounded
O, I’m gonna be your wound
O, I’m gonna bruise you
O, you’re gonna be my bruise
--- Unknown ---
Just too unreal, all this?
--- WENDLA ---
Watching his world slip through my fist
--- MELCHIOR ---
Playing with her in your fantasies
--- BOTH ---
Haven’t you heard the word? How I want you?
--- Unknown ---
O, I’m gonna be wounded
O, I’m gonna be your wound
O, I’m gonna bruise you
O, you’re gonna be my bruise
