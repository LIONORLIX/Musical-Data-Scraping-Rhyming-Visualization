Whispering
Here the ghosts in the moonlight
Sorrow doing a new dance
Through their bone, through their skin
--- Unknown ---
Listening
To the souls in the fool's night
Fumbling mutely with their rude hands
And there's heartache without end
--- Unknown ---
See the father bent in grief
The mother dressed in mourning
Sister crumbles, and the neighbors grumble
The preacher issues warnings
--- Unknown ---
History
Little miss didn't do right
Went and ruined all the true plans
Such a shame. Such a sin.
--- Unknown ---
Mystery
Home alone on a school night
Harvest moon over the blue land
Summer longing on the wind
--- Unknown ---
Had a sweetheart on his knees
So faithful and adoring
And he touched me. And I let him love me.
So let that be my story
--- Unknown ---
Listening
For the hope, for the new life
Something beautiful, a new chance
Hear its whispering
