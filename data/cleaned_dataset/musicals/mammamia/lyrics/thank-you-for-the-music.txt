------ Thank You for the Music ------

Thank you for the music
The songs I'm singing
Thanks for all the joy
They're bringing
Who can live without it
I ask in all honesty
What would life be

HARRY / SOPHIE
Without a song or a dance what are we?
So I say thank you for the music
For giving it to me

Mother says I was
A dancer before I could walk
She says I began
To sing long before I could talk
And I've often wondered
How did it all start?
Who found out that nothing
Can capture a heart
Like a melody can?
Well who ever it was, I'm a fan
--- Unknown ---
SOPHIE / HARRY
So I say
Thank you for the music
The songs I'm singing
Thanks for all the joy
They're bringing
Who can live without it
I ask in all honesty
What would life be
Without a song or a dance what are we?
So I say thank you for the music
For giving it to me
--- SOPHIE ---
I've been so lucky
I am the girl with golden hair
I wanna sing it out to everybody
What a joy
What a life
What a chance

SOPHIE / HARRY / BILL
