------ The Name of the Game ------
--- SOPHIE ---
I've seen you twice
In a short time
Only a week since we started
It seems to me
For every time
I'm getting more open-hearted
--- Unknown ---
Your smile and the sound of your voice
And the way you see through me
Got a feeling, you give me no chioce
But it means a lot to me
So I wanna know
--- Unknown ---
What's the name of the game?
Does it mean anything to you?
What's the name of the game?
Can you feel it the way I do?
Tell me please
'Cause I have to know
I'm a bashful child
Beginning to grow
--- Unknown ---
And you make me talk
And you make me feel
And you make me show
What I'm trying to conceal
If I trust in you
Would you let me down?
Would you laugh at me
If I said I care for you?
Could you feel the same way too?
I wanna know
What's the name of the game
--- BILL ---
I'll talk to your mother tonight
--- SOPHIE ---
Does it mean anything to you?
--- BILL ---
Gotta trust me, I'm doing what's right
And it means a lot
--- SOPHIE ---
What's the name of the game?
--- BILL ---
Your smile and the sound of your voice
--- SOPHIE ---
Can you feel it the way I do?
Tell me please
'Cause I have to know
I'm a curious child
Beginning to grow
--- Unknown ---
And you make me talk
And you make me feel
And you make me show
What I'm trying to conceal
If I trust in you
Would you let me down?
Would you laugh at me
If I said I care for you?
Could you feel the same way too?
I wanna know
The name of the game
--- BILL ---
I'll talk to your mother today
--- SOPHIE ---
Does it mean anything to you?
--- BILL ---
Just give me an hour
And it means a lot
--- SOPHIE ---
What's the name of the game?
Do you feel the way I do?
I wanna know
Oh yes, I wanna know
