------ Gimme! Gimme! ------
--- GIRLS ---
Is there a man out there?
Someone to hear my prayer
--- Unknown ---
Gimme! Gimme! Gimme!
A man after midnight
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away?
Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! A man after midnight
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day
--- SOPHIE ---
Sorry to drag you away
--- SAM ---
Thank God you did, this used to be
a quiet wee island.
--- SOPHIE ---
Regretting you stayed away so long?
--- SAM ---
No, I'm regretting I never knew
what was here.
--- SOPHIE ---
What?
--- SAM ---
This plave - the Taverna. I always
meant to come back and build it
some day, but - she beat me to it.
--- SOPHIE ---
Do you prefer buildings to people?
--- SAM ---
What?!
--- SOPHIE ---
Tell me something about my mum.
--- SAM ---
Your mum was irresistible, a one-off.
We talked and we fought - you
know it was me that brought her to
this island?
--- SOPHIE ---
That wasn't the only thing you did,
was it?
--- SAM ---
Oh right, what has she told you?
--- SOPHIE ---
Nothing. She's never mentioned
you.
--- SAM ---
But you said Mum's always talking
about her friends from the old
days. What's going on? Sophie,
why am I here?
--- GIRLS ---
Is there a man out there

Gimme! Gimme! Gimme!
A man after midnight

--- HARRY ---
Fancy Donna with a grown-up
daughter!
--- SOPHIE ---
Have you got any children, Harry?
--- HARRY ---
No. I haven't put myself in the path
of paternity.
--- SOPHIE ---
It's never too late.
--- HARRY ---
I don't think my other half would
agree.
--- SOPHIE ---
Oh - you don't want children?
--- HARRY ---
No, no, it's not like that. It's just that:
: well, I'd have liked a daughter. I'd
have spoiled her to bits.
--- SOPHIE ---
Lucky thing.
--- HARRY ---
Is your Dad here?
--- SOPHIE ---
I don't know.
--- HARRY ---
What?
--- SOPHIE ---
I don't know who my Dad is.
--- GIRLS ---
Is there a man out there?
Someone to hear my prayer:
--- BILL ---
Can I be nosey, I'm a writer so it
goes with the territory.
--- SOPHIE ---
Go on.
--- BILL ---
How did your mother get this place?
When I knew her
she was singing in a night-club on
the mainland.
--- SOPHIE ---
She was left some money, in a will.
We lived with an old lady when I
was little. Her name was Sophia?
--- BILL ---
What, my Great-Aunt Sophia?
--- SOPHIE ---
I think it must be.
--- BILL ---
But: I always heard her money
went to: family:
Wait a minute - how old are you?
--- SOPHIE ---
Twenty.

Gimme! Gimme! Gimme!
