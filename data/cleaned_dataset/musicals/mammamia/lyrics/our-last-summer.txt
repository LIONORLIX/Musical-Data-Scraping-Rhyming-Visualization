------ Our Last Summer ------
--- HARRY ---
I can still recall
Our last summer
I still see it all
Walks along the Seine
Laughing in the rain
Our last summer
Memories that remain
--- Unknown ---
We made our way along the river
And we sat down in the grass by the Eiffel tower
I was so happy we had met
It was the age of no regret
Oh, yes
Those crazy years
That was the time of the flower-power
But underneath
We had a fear of flying
Of growing old
A fear of slowly dying
We took our chance
Like we were dancing our last dance
--- HARRY & DONNA ---
I can still recall
Our last summer
I still see it all
--- HARRY ---
In the tourist jam
--- DONNA ---
Round the Notre Dame
--- HARRY & DONNA ---
Our last summer
Walking hand in hand
--- DONNA ---
Paris restaurants
--- HARRY & DONNA ---
Our last summer
--- HARRY ---
Morning croissants
--- HARRY & DONNA ---
Living for the day
Worries far away
Our last summer
We could laugh and play
--- DONNA ---
And now you're working in a bank
The family man, a football fan
And your name is Harry
How dull it seems
Yet, you were the hero of my dreams
--- HARRY & DONNA ---
I can still recall
Our last summer
I still see it all
Walks along the Seine
Laughing in the rain
Our last summer
