--- DONNA & THE DYNAMOS ---
Super Trouper
Beams are gonna blind me
But I won't feel blue
Like I always do
'Cause somewhere in the crowd
There's you
--- DONNA ---
I was sick and tired of everything
When I called you last night from Glasgow
All I do is eat, and sleep, and sing
Wishing every show was the last show
So imagine I was glad to hear you're coming
Suddenly it feels alright
And it's gonna be so different
When I'm on the stage tonight
Tonight the
--- DONNA & DYNAMOS & GIRLS ---
Super Trouper
Lights are gonna find me
Shining like the sun
Smiling, having fun
Feeling like a number one
Tonight the
Super Trouper
Beams are gonna blind me
But I won't feel blue
Like I always do
'Cause somewhere in the crowd
There's you
--- DONNA ---
Facing twenty thousand of your friends
How can anyone be so lonely?
Part of a success that never ends
Still I'm thinking about you only
There are moments when I think I'm going crazy
But it's gonna be alright
And it's gonna be so different
When I'm on the stage tonight
Tonight the
--- DONNA & THE DYNAMOS & GIRLS ---
Super Trouper
Lights are gonna find me
Shining like the sun
Smiling, having fun
Feeling like a number one
Tonight the
Super Trouper
Beams are gonna blind me
But I won't feel blue
Like I always do
'Cause somewhere in the crowd
There's you
--- DONNA ---
So I'll be there
When you arrive
The sight of you will prove to me
I'm still alive
And when you take me in your arms
And hold me tight
I know it's gonna mean so much tonight
Tonight the
--- DONNA & THE DYNAMOS & GIRLS ---
Super Trouper
Lights are gonna find me
Shining like the sun
Smiling, having fun
Feeling like a number one
Tonight the
Super Trouper
Beams are gonna blind me
But I won't feel blue
Like I always do
'Cause somewhere in the crowd
There's you
Super Trouper
