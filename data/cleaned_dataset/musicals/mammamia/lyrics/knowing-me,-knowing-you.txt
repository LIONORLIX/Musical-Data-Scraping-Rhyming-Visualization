------ Knowing Me, Knowing You ------
--- SAM ---
No more carefree laughter
Silence ever after
Walking through an empty house
Tears in my eyes
This is how the story ends
This is goodbye
--- Unknown ---
Knowing me, knowing you
There is nothing we can do
Knowing me, knowing you
We just have to face it
This time we're through
Breaking up is never easy, I know
But I have to go
Knowing me, knowing you
It's the best I can do
--- Unknown ---
Memories, good days, bad days
They'll be with me always
In those old familiar rooms
Children would play
Now there's only emptiness
Nothing to say
--- Unknown ---
Knowing me, knowing you
There is nothing we can do
Knowing me, knowing you
We just have to face it
This time we're through
Breaking up is never easy, I know
But I have to go
Knowing me, knowing you
It's the best I can do
Knowing me, knowing you
