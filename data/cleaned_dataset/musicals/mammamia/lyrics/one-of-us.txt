------ One of Us ------
--- DONNA ---
They passed me by
All of those great romances
Because of your
Robbing me
Of my rightful chances
My picture clear
Everything seemed so easy
But the you dealt me the blow
One of us had to go
How you hurt me
I want you to know

One of us is crying
One of us is lying
In her lonely bed
Staring at the ceiling
Wishing she was somewhere else instead
One of us is lonely
One of us is only
Waiting for a call
Sorry for herself
Feeling stupid
Feeling small
Wishing you had
Never left at all
Never left at all

good enough for her?
--- DONNA ---
And that is none of your business

--- SAM ---
Alright, be a bloody martyr, listen,
I've got kids, I know it's hard for
you doing it on your own.
--- DONNA ---
Don't bloody patronise me. I love
doing it on my own - every morning.
I wake up and thank Christ I
haven't got some middle-aged,
menopausal man to bother me - I'm
