------ Chiquitita ------
--- ROSIE ---
Chiquitita, tell me what's wrong
--- TANYA ---
I have never seen such sorrow
--- ROSIE & TANYA ---
In your eyes
and the wedding is tomorrow
--- TANYA ---
How I hate to see you like this
--- ROSIE ---
There is no way you can deny it
--- TANYA ---
I can see
That you're oh so sad, so quiet
--- ROSIE & TANYA ---
Chiquitita, tell me the truth
I'm a shoulder you can cry on
Your best friend
I'm the one you must rely on
You were always sure of yourself
Now I see
You've broken a feather
I hope
We can patch it up together
--- Unknown ---
Chiquitita
You and I know
How the heartaches come and they go
And the scars they're leavin'
You'll be dancin' once again
And the pain will end
You will have no time for grievin'
--- Unknown ---
Chiquitita
You and I cry
But the sun is still in the sky
And shining above you
Let me hear you sing once more
Like you did before
Sing a new song
Chiquitita
--- DONNA ---
Try once more like you did before
Sing a new song
