------ Mamma Mia ------
--- DONNA ---
I was cheated by you
And I think you know when.
So I made up my mind, it must come to an end
Look at me now, will I ever learn?
I don't know how but I suddenly lose control
There's a fire within my soul
Just one look and I can hear a bell ring
One more look and I forget everything
--- Unknown ---
Mamma mia, here I go again
My my, how can I resist you?
Mamma mia, does it show again
My My, just how much I've missed you?
Yes, I've been broken-hearted
Blue since the day we parted
Why, why did I ever let you go?
Mamma mia, now I really know
My my, I should not have let you go
--- Unknown ---
Look at me now
Will I ever learn
I don't know how
But I suddenly loose control
There's a fire within my soul.
Just one look and I can hear a bell ring
One more look and I forget everything

Mamma mia, here I go again
My my, how can I resist you?
Mamma mia, does it show again
My, my, just how much I've missed you?
Yes, I've been brokenhearted
Blue since the day we parted
Why, why did I ever let you go?
Mamma mia, now I really know
My my, I should not have let you go
--- DONNA ---
What the hell are you all doing here?
Well I'd love to stop and chat, but I
have to go and clean out my
handbag: or something
--- BILL ---
Age does not wither her.
--- HARRY ---
I was expecting a rather shout
matron
--- SAM ---
No she's still Donna.

Just one look and I can hear a bell ring
One more look and I forget everything
