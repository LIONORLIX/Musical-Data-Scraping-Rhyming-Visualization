The beginning.
A story about alvin kelby.
My mom passed away
In the summer i turned six
--- Unknown ---
Write that down.
--- Unknown ---
Thomas
Alvin, what's the point’
--- Unknown ---
Alvin
Trust me.
--- Unknown ---
(thomas writes in his notebook.)
--- Unknown ---
Thomas
Alvin's mom passed away in the summer he turned six.
--- Unknown ---
Alvin
Good.
--- Unknown ---
And left a single father and his son.
--- Unknown ---
But dad had the bookstore
With a leaky roof to fix.
So i was on my own
Facing the unknown,
The terrifying prospect of grade one.
--- Unknown ---
But at the time how was i to see
A kind and gentle soul was waiting there for me’
--- Unknown ---
Mrs. Remington, our first grade teacher
Made elementary school a better place.
But her single most disturbing feature
Was the coarse black hair on her face.
--- Unknown ---
Maybe she was menopausal.
Lack of estrogen will cause
A lot of odd conditions,
Some acute!
--- Unknown ---
The irony would never faze her
Namesake of a famous razor.
And to be so facially hirsute.
--- Unknown ---
But mrs. Remington smiled
And she would brighten my day.
Back then a teacher hugged you
To make you feel okay.
--- Unknown ---
Though my face sorta stung
From mrs. Remington’s beard,
When she held me, my problems disappeared.
--- Unknown ---
Mrs. Lynch was an ignoramus,
Mr. Pollack was just plain mean.
Mrs. Remington was nearly famous
For her parties at halloween.
--- Unknown ---
Pumpkin heads of every shape
Were cut out of construction paper.
Each and every one would be displayed.
--- Unknown ---
The highlight for the children was
To make a really special costume
For the yearly halloween parade.
--- Unknown ---
Mrs. Remington smiled
And she was clearly content
As she lovingly presided
Over this, the main event.
--- Unknown ---
So we’d nervously walk
Past her critical eyes
And we’d vie for mrs. Remington’s top prize.
--- Unknown ---
Thomas
There was this one kid wearing cardboard wings,
A coat hanger halo, carrying a bell and a homemade book that said tom sawyer.
Nobody had a clue what he was supposed to be.
--- Unknown ---
Alvin except me.
--- Unknown ---
(alvin becomes his younger self.)
--- Unknown ---
Oh, oh, oh, mrs. Remington!
--- Unknown ---
Pamela koshan thought he was the statue of liberty.
--- Unknown ---
Mrs. Remington, i know!
--- Unknown ---
Thomas
Donnie carter thought he was a thanksgiving turkey.
--- Unknown ---
Alvin
Mrs. Remington, i know. He’s clarence.
The angel from it’s a wonderful life. He was my mother’s favorite.
--- Unknown ---
Thomas
The class laughed.
Alvin
I cried. And mrs. Remington announced that i was next.
--- Unknown ---
But mrs. Remington smiled
In that way that she had.
A smile that made you realize
That things were not so bad.
--- Unknown ---
And i knew from her face
That this feeling would pass.
So i went to take my turn before the class.
--- Unknown ---
Thomas
Those poor kids were still trying to figure out who the heck clarence was...
--- Unknown ---
Alvin
... When i shuffled onto the platform in fuzzy slippers and bathrobe,
With pink sponge curlers in my hair.
alvin kelby, mrs. Remington said, and what are you supposed to be’
--- Unknown ---
I’m a ghost. The ghost of my mother.
--- Unknown ---
Lunch that day was awful lonely
Sitting by myself and only
Wearing fuzzy slippers and chenille.
--- Unknown ---
While all the kids were making fun
In came mrs. Remington
With clarence dragging slowly on her heel.
--- Unknown ---
"clarence," she said, "i’d like you to meet mrs. Kelby. She’s a big fan of yours."
--- Unknown ---
And mrs. Remington smiled
‘Cause mrs. Remington knew
That the battlefield of childhood
Was easier with two.
--- Unknown ---
Mrs. Remington watched,
As the angels do,
And on halloween that year
She saw two masks disappear
When my mother met her angel
And i met you.
