------ Independence Day ------
--- Unknown ---
Alvin
This is it, tom.
This is it.
--- Unknown ---
Thomas
The morning before the big trip.
--- Unknown ---
Alvin
Twenty-four hours and i will be there.
--- Unknown ---
Thomas
All i could think was... Boy this day came fast.
Alvin
To ruffle your feathers and get in your hair.
--- Unknown ---
Thomas
All i could think was... I have things to take care of.
--- Unknown ---
Alvin
The whole town can perish, i don’t even care.
--- Unknown ---
Thomas
But all i could say was... See you tomorrow.
--- Unknown ---
Alvin
This is it, tom.
This is it.
--- Unknown ---
I never thought this day would actually come.
--- Unknown ---
This morning i finally believed it.
I woke up and felt it begin.
--- Unknown ---
"i’m shaking the dust of this
Crummy old town off my feet.
--- Unknown ---
Take that, george bailey!
--- Unknown ---
I'll make up a sign for the bookstore
And hang it where people come in
Saying ‘closing for christmas.
The owner is hitting the street.’
--- Unknown ---
Look, i’ll never be a world traveler.
I just wasn’t built that way.
Still, this could be my independence day.
--- Unknown ---
Thomas
Aren't you blowing this a little out of proportion’
--- Unknown ---
Alvin
I think of the times throughout history
A day unremarkably dawned
Then one man was seized
By the restless desire to explore.
--- Unknown ---
He looked up and scanned the horizon
And wondered what might lie beyond.
Then hoisted his anchor
And sailed for some uncharted shore.
--- Unknown ---
Well now my destiny’s calling,
And i can hear it say
This could be my independence day.
--- Unknown ---
Thomas
It's just a trip to the city, al.
--- Unknown ---
Alvin
Of course you wouldn’t understand.
--- Unknown ---
This is a feeling you must feel every day
As publishing’s latest man-of-the-hour.
--- Unknown ---
Four bestsellers and counting, tom.
--- Unknown ---
I really can’t compete with your resume.
--- Unknown ---
But something deep is stirring
And shifting inside.
The boundaries are blurring
And opening wide.
It's suddenly occurring
That finally i deserve
To stray and reach and yearn
And dare to say
It might just be my turn.
--- Unknown ---
It’s rare that you notice a moment
The moment it’s hurrying by
And instantly frame it
And say that’s when everything changed.
--- Unknown ---
But now, there’s a moment approaching.
I’m staring it straight in the eye.
Prepared for a future
Of moments that aren’t prearranged.
--- Unknown ---
Old george bailey was cheated
He never left his town.
Beaten down and defeated
He even tried to drown.
But look at me, i’ve been treated
To life turned upside-down.
Welcome to my independence day.
--- Unknown ---
This is it, tom.
This is it.
--- Unknown ---
Thomas
All i could think was... I never told ann he was coming.
--- Unknown ---
Alvin
Christmas, the two of us, just like before.
--- Unknown ---
Thomas
All i could think was... I never told alvin i'm engaged.
--- Unknown ---
Alvin
Like back in my living room over the store.
--- Unknown ---
Thomas
All i could think was... Things here have gotten complicated.
--- Unknown ---
Alvin
Who says the holidays have to be more’
--- Unknown ---
Thomas
But all i could say was...
--- Unknown ---
Alvin
This is it, tom.
This is...
--- Unknown ---
Thomas
Al. Don't come.
--- Unknown ---
(silence.)
--- Unknown ---
Alvin
Why not’
--- Unknown ---
Thomas
It's not a good time. Al’ What do you think, al’
--- Unknown ---
Alvin
This is it, tom
Me and you.
--- Unknown ---
Thomas
The next time that we said goodbye
--- Unknown ---
Alvin
If you commit, tom
You see it through.
--- Unknown ---
Thomas
Why is it always goodbye’
--- Unknown ---
Goodbye, al.
--- Unknown ---
Alvin
Goodbye, tom.
--- Unknown ---
Thomas
Relationships thrive or dissolve
Without our knowing why.
And somehow goodbye became easy.
--- Unknown ---
Wait! Let me explain. It really wasn't a good time. I...
