Thomas
In eighteen seventy-six
Cars were not invented.
They didn’t have the radio
Or movies or t.v.
And they had more diseases then
Which now can be prevented
But someone wrote a book that year
That still gets read by kids today like me.
--- Unknown ---
In eighteen seventy-six
There wasn’t indoor plumbing
They didn’t have a ton of things
We take for granted now.
Though every year there seems to be
Some luxury that’s coming
A book like this from way back then
Is still around somehow.
--- Unknown ---
I guess i used to think
That books were only words on paper
But when i’m reading this
It’s like tom sawyer’s really here.
--- Unknown ---
When things are written down
They don’t just disappear like vapor.
They travel on through time
Beyond that one specific year.
--- Unknown ---
And i think writing stuff like that
Would make a neat career.
--- Unknown ---
In eighteen seventy-six
Some guy from missouri
Put all these adventures down
And made them come alive.
And just because that writer
Wrote this one amazing story
Eighteen seventy-six
Was so much better than
Eighteen seventy-five.
