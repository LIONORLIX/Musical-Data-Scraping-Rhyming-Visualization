Alvin
There's gotta be thousands of stories in this head of yours, tom.
Don’t look for one that isn't there.
--- Unknown ---
(alvin looks around at the mess of papers and books strewn about in thomas’s mind.)
--- Unknown ---
This is it tom
This is all there is.
And isn’t it amazing’
--- Unknown ---
Here we sit, tom.
Forever tossing branches off a bridge.
--- Unknown ---
Here we’re frozen at ten.
Here we’re awkward young men.
And you filed away these memories
Bit by bit.
--- Unknown ---
Now look again.
--- Unknown ---
You wanted a story, tom
Well this,
All around you,
This is it.
--- Unknown ---
Admit, tom
You expected more.
But isn’t this refreshing’
This is it, tom.
Sure, it’s nothing like the picture on the box.
--- Unknown ---
And no secrets exist,
In some moment you missed,
Just accept that sometimes pieces
Might not fit.
--- Unknown ---
And that’s okay.
--- Unknown ---
‘Cause all that you needed, tom
Is here.
All around you,
This is it.
--- Unknown ---
Look at them all. Stories about you. Stories about me. Stories about us.
Just waiting for you to pick them and write them down.
--- Unknown ---
You are a writer.
Take what you know.
Here there's a lifetime of moments and details
Now you make them blossom and grow.
--- Unknown ---
Find what’s important.
--- Unknown ---
Thomas
Find what’s important.
--- Unknown ---
Alvin
Help it to thrive.
--- Unknown ---
Thomas
Help it to thrive.
--- Unknown ---
Alvin
When you rearrange them and tell them
You keep all our memories and stories alive.
--- Unknown ---
Thousands of stories
--- Unknown ---
Thomas
Thousands of stories
--- Unknown ---
Both
Constantly new.
--- Unknown ---
Alvin
So our stories remain
--- Unknown ---
Thomas
Stories remain
--- Unknown ---
Alvin
Full of laughter and pain.
--- Unknown ---
Thomas
Mixed with capra and twain.
--- Unknown ---
Alvin
Told by you.
--- Unknown ---
You and me, tom
This is all we get.
And wasn’t it exciting’
But don’t you see, tom
It isn’t really over, after all.
--- Unknown ---
Just like stones in a lake
And the ripples they make
Stories carry on through time
And never quit.
--- Unknown ---
It’s up to you.
--- Unknown ---
This isn’t my story now
It’s yours.
Look around you.
This is it.
--- Unknown ---
This is you.
This is me.
This is love.
This is life.
This is it.
