The greatest gift.
A story about alvin and thomas.
--- Unknown ---
Thomas
Alvin and his father lived on the second floor above his father's bookstore.
--- Unknown ---
Alvin
It was called the writer's block - new and used books.
--- Unknown ---
Thomas
One christmas eve,
Alvin and i made snow angels and watched frank capra's it's a wonderful life.
--- Unknown ---
Alvin
Our annual tradition.
--- Unknown ---
Thomas
Then alvin took me downstairs to the bookstore. We were eleven.
--- Unknown ---
(they take a step into the past.)
--- Unknown ---
Alvin
Trust me.
--- Unknown ---
Thomas
What are we doing’
--- Unknown ---
Alvin
We're going to pick out a book for your christmas present.
--- Unknown ---
Thomas
Cool. Which one’
--- Unknown ---
Alvin
I don't know, but it's somewhere in this mystical place.
--- Unknown ---
Thomas
Mystical place’
--- Unknown ---
Alvin
Mystical place.
--- Unknown ---
Thomas
It’s a bookstore.
--- Unknown ---
Alvin
No. It’s a great and powerful force capable of extraordinary feats.
--- Unknown ---
Thomas
Alvin's father was known for having the uncanny knack
Of finding the perfect book for each of his customers.
Of course, alvin saw things... Differently.
--- Unknown ---
Alvin
Every day
People come into this bookstore.
Never knowing it was built
On sacred hollowed ground.
--- Unknown ---
Thomas
Don't you mean ‘hallowed’’
--- Unknown ---
Alvin
They travel here from all around.
Poor souls looking for stories.
--- Unknown ---
Thomas
Where's my present’
--- Unknown ---
Alvin
These desperate pilgrims enter this shrine. My father says...
--- Unknown ---
‘good afternoon,’
--- Unknown ---
Or ‘morning’ as the case may be.
--- Unknown ---
‘i’m the owner of this bookstore.
Can i help you please?’
And they say, ‘not right now sir, thanks a lot.
But i’ll peruse the books you’ve got.
I’m just looking for stories.’
--- Unknown ---
So dad allows them to search the stacks.
And they hunt and browse
And they read the backs.
--- Unknown ---
But eventually,
Inevitably,
They ask for dad’s advice.
--- Unknown ---
They talk a little.
--- Unknown ---
Then he gets this look all dazed and queer.
And he mumbles things i can't quite hear.
--- Unknown ---
(alvin imitates his father’s mumbling.)
--- Unknown ---
Then, like a shot,
He goes right to the perfect spot
And finds their special book,
The one distinctive book,
The story that will change that person’s life.
--- Unknown ---
You see’
--- Unknown ---
Thomas
See what’
Alvin
This store speaks through my father. He's a conduit. He's an instrument.
He's a vessel. And i am his son. I too hear the prophetic whisper of the bookstore spirit.
I will now attempt to use my ancestral gifts to guide you to your present.
--- Unknown ---
(alvin listens intently for the prophetic whisper.)
--- Unknown ---
Thomas
You couldn’t just get me a model airplane?
--- Unknown ---
Alvin
Shhh!
--- Unknown ---
Speak to me
Noble spirit of the bookstore.
This is alvin here.
--- Unknown ---
Thomas
And thomas.
--- Unknown ---
Alvin
Is there something you can recommend
As a gift for thomas, my best friend?
Can you find him a story?
--- Unknown ---
(alvin listens again.)
--- Unknown ---
Thomas
Do you hear anything yet?
--- Unknown ---
Alvin
No.
--- Unknown ---
Wait! It needs... Something. It needs both of us.
--- Unknown ---
Thomas
What do we do’
--- Unknown ---
Alvin
Now we stand up straight looking shy and meek.
--- Unknown ---
Thomas
Now we stand up straight looking shy and meek.
--- Unknown ---
Alvin
And we humbly wait for the store to speak.
--- Unknown ---
Thomas
And we humbly wait for the store to speak.
--- Unknown ---
Both
Soon we will hear the answer
That we're preparing to receive.
--- Unknown ---
Alvin
Now the next part’s not entirely clear.
It’s the part where dad gets dazed and queer.
--- Unknown ---
Thomas
I think you nailed that part.
--- Unknown ---
Alvin
I see... I see... I see a guy wearing cardboard wings,
A coat hanger halo, carrying a bell and a homemade book...
--- Unknown ---
Wait!
Holy cow!
I know which book to give you now.
--- Unknown ---
Thomas
Well.
--- Unknown ---
Alvin
You’ll be grateful that i interceded.
And found the book you never knew you needed.
--- Unknown ---
Thomas
Come on.
--- Unknown ---
Alvin
The story that will change my best friend’s life.

--- Unknown ---
Thomas

A book report by tommy weaver.
Sixth grade.
--- Unknown ---
(thomas addresses his sixth grade class.)
--- Unknown ---
I got this book from my friend alvin.
It's a really good story but my favorite part is in the pre-face. It goes like this.
--- Unknown ---
(he opens the book and reads.)
--- Unknown ---
‘part of my plan has been to try to pleasantly remind adults of what they once were themselves,
And what queer enterprises they sometimes engaged in. The author. Hartford.
