Thomas
We are gathered to honor the life of alvin kelby. He was my best friend.
--- Unknown ---
(he finds a pen and makes a correction.)
--- Unknown ---
My good friend.
--- Unknown ---
My oldest friend.
--- Unknown ---
My insert-adjective-later friend.
--- Unknown ---
(he tears the page from the book and tries again.)
--- Unknown ---
Hello. My name is thomas weaver.
I?m a multi-award-winning, best-selling author and i have absolutely no idea what to write.
--- Unknown ---
Write what you know, tom.
--- Unknown ---
Write what you know.
--- Unknown ---
(thomas writes.)
--- Unknown ---
We met in first grade.
We were friends for years.
Good friends.
Inseparable.
--- Unknown ---
(he stops writing.)
--- Unknown ---
That much i know.
That much i know.
--- Unknown ---
Write what you know, tom.
Write what you know.
--- Unknown ---
(he resumes writing.)
--- Unknown ---
He was a smart kid.
He was sort of odd.
--- Unknown ---
No. Interesting.
--- Unknown ---
No. Odd.
--- Unknown ---
He worked in his father?s bookstore.
His father got sick.
--- Unknown ---
(he stops.)
That much i know.
That much i know.
--- Unknown ---
But that?s not the story.
This is just fact.
What was the crisis that went undetected?
When was the instant it splintered and cracked?
--- Unknown ---
What was the moment?
I missed it somehow
And if i could narrow it down to a moment,
What good is knowing that now?
--- Unknown ---
What was my responsibility?
What did i owe?
Am i to blame
For all of the details i?ll never know?
--- Unknown ---
But how could i know?
--- Unknown ---
Write what you know, tom.
--- Unknown ---
(he makes another attempt to write.)
--- Unknown ---
I went to college
Alvin stayed behind.
His father passed away.
I left him here alone.
--- Unknown ---
(he stops.)
--- Unknown ---
That much i know.
That much i know.
--- Unknown ---
Some lives hurtle forward
And some never budge
And sometimes a life takes a different direction
With an innocuous innocent nudge.
--- Unknown ---
Did i do the nudging
When his life careened?
Now how do i bounce through a lifetime
To pinpoint when i should have intervened?
--- Unknown ---
Where is that story?
What should i say?
I've gotta do this right, alvin.
I?ve gotta find the piece of the puzzle
That brought me here today.
--- Unknown ---
(as thomas violently tears the page from his notebook,
The funeral chapel fades and thomas finds himself deep inside
His own mind surrounded by endless shelves cluttered
With papers and books - a lifetime?s accumulation of memories and stories.
Seated among them is alvin kelby.)
--- Unknown ---
What is the moment?
What is the story?
Use your own words tom.
Write what you know.
--- Unknown ---
Alvin
There's gotta be thousands of stories in this head of yours, tom.
--- Unknown ---
Thomas
Don't bother me, alvin. I'm writing.
--- Unknown ---
(alvin looks at thomas?s empty notebook.)
--- Unknown ---
Alvin
No you're not. There's nothing there.
--- Unknown ---
Thomas
Writing's a process. Words are just the final step. Now be quiet. I can do this on my own.
--- Unknown ---
Alvin
Really? And when was the last time you actually wrote something, tom?
--- Unknown ---
(this touches a nerve. Alvin starts to collect up loose pages.)
--- Unknown ---
So, here's what we're going to do. We're going to pick a story and you're going to write it down.
Then we'll pick another... And another... And another. You get the idea?
That's all a eulogy is, tom. You tell a bunch of stories, save the tear-jerker for the end and...
--- Unknown ---
(alvin places a large stack of pages in front of thomas.)
--- Unknown ---
... There you have it. My eulogy. The story of my life.
Written by best-selling author thomas weaver.
--- Unknown ---
Thomas
You make it sound so easy.
--- Unknown ---
Alvin
Isn't it? Here's a thought. Why don't you begin with this one?
