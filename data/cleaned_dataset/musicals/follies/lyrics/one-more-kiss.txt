------ One More Kiss ------
--- HEIDI ---
One more kiss before we part,
One more kiss and--farewell,
Never shall we meet again,
Just a kiss and then
We break the spell.
One more kiss to melt the heart,
One more glimpse of the past.
HEIDI and YOUNG HEIDI:
One more souvenir of bliss
Knowing well that this
One must be the last.
Dreamt are a sweet mistake.
All dreamers must awake.
YOUNG HEIDI:
On, then, with the dance,
No backward glance
Or my heart will break.
Never look back.
HEIDI:
Never look back. YOUNG HEIDI:
One more kiss before we part. Ah...ah...
Not with tears or a sigh.
All things beautiful must die. All things beautiful must die.
Now that our love is done,
Lover, give me...
BOTH:
...One
