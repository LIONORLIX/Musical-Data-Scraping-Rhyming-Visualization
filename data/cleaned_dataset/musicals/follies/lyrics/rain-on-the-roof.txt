------ Rain on the Roof ------
--- EMILY and THEODORE WHITMAN ---
Listen to the rain on the roof go
EMILY:
Pit-pitty-pat--
THEODORE WHITMAN:
Pit-pitty-pat--
EMILY and THEODORE WHITMAN:
Pitty--
Sit, kitty cat,
We won't get home for hours.
Relax and
Listen to the rain on the roof go
EMILY:
Plunk-planka-plink-
THEODORE WHITMAN:
Plunk-planka-plink-
EMILY and THEODORE WHITMAN:
Planka-
Let's have a drink
And shelter from the showers.
Rain, rain, don't go away,
Fill up the sky.
Rain through the night.
We'll stay
Cozy and dry.
Listen to the rain on the roof go
Pit-pitty-pat-
Plunk-a-plink-
Plank-
Pity that
It's not a hurricane.
Listen plink to the
------ fin ------
