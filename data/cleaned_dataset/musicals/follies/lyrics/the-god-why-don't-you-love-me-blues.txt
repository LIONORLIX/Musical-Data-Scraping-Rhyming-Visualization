------ The God Why-Don't-You-Love-Me Blues ------
--- BUDDY ---
Hello, folks, we're into the Follies!
First, though, folks, we'll pause for a mo'.
No, no, folks, you'll still get your jollies--
It's just I got a problem that I think you should know.
See, I've been very perturbed of late, very upset,
Very betwixt and between.
The things that I want, I don't seem to get.
The things that I get--you know what I mean!
I've got those
God-why-don't-you-love-me-oh-you-do-I'll-see-you-later
Blues,
That
Long-as-you-ignore-me-you're-the-only-thing-that-matters
Feelin,
That
If-I'm-good-enough-for-you-you're-not-good-enough
and, Thank-you-for-the-present-but-what's-wrong-with-It?

Feelings,
