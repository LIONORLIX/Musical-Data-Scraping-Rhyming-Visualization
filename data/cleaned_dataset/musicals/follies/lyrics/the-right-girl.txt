------ The Right Girl ------
--- BUDDY ---
The right girl--yeah!
The right girl,
She makes you feel like a million bucks
Instead of-what? --like a rented tux.
The right girl-yeah!
The right girl,
She's with you, no matter how you feel,
You're not the good guy, you're not the heel.
You're not the dreamboat that sank-you're real
When you got-yeah!
The right girl-yeah!
And I got--
Hey, Margie, I'm back, babe.
Come help me unpack, babe.
Hey, Margie, hey, bright girl,
I'm home.
What's new, babe? You miss me?
You smell good, come kiss me.
Hey, Margie, you wanna go dancing!
I'm home.
Des Moines was rotten and the deal fell through.
I pushed, babe.
I'm bushed, babe.
I needed you to tell my troubles to--
The heck, babe--
Let's neck, babe.
Hey, Margie.
You wanna go dancing?
You wanna go driving? Or something?
Okay, babe.
Whatever you say, babe--
You wanna stay home!
You wanna stay home!
Hey, Margie. It's day, babe.
My flight goes--no, stay, babe,
You know how you cry, babe--
Stay home.
Be good now, we'll speak, babe,
It might be next week, babe--
Hey, Margie--goodbye, babe--
I gotta go home.
The right girl--yeah!
The right girl--yeah!
She sees you're nothing and thinks you're king,
She knows you've got other songs to sing.
You still could be-hell, well, anything
When you got--yeah!
The right girl-yeah!
And I got...
Hey, Margie, I'm back, babe.
Come help me unpack, babe.
Hey, Margie, hey, bright girl,
I'm home.
You miss me? I knew it.
Hey, Margie, I blew it--
I don't love the right girl.
