------ Falling ------
--- Luisa ---
Did I close my eyes
And dream that I was falling
Did I feel the wind?
Or hear the ocean calling?
--- Unknown ---
Have I turned around
To find the world is spinning?
Have I lost my mind?
Or found a new beginning?
--- Unknown ---
Luisa, it's a man you've never met
So don't fool yourself
Don't take risks that you'll regret.
--- Unknown ---
Take a breath and count to three
Or maybe ten
Ooh, This isn't me
This is absurd
It can't be real
But why be afraid of what you feel?
--- Unknown ---
For I closed my eyes
And dreamed that I was feelnig
And I felt the wind
And heard the ocean calling
--- Unknown ---
Then I turned around
To see the world was spinning
Had I lost my mind
Or found a new beginning?
--- Unknown ---
Silence
All the words we couldn't say
But we understood
Answers end but questions stay
--- Unknown ---
Between the lights we've yet to read
And who can say
Where they may lead?
We take the risk or turn away
--- Unknown ---
For I've learnt that charms
Mean nothing when they're spoken
And I don't need vows
When promises are broken
--- Unknown ---
And I've always learnt
That mystery is revealing
And the truth is hard
If only one worth feeling
--- Unknown ---
He is all I feel
Words are not in lies
Trust what isn't known
Dreams within their eyes, disguse
Take us by surpise
--- Unknown ---
For I closed my eyes
And dreamed that I am falling
And I feel the wind
I hear the ocean calling
--- Unknown ---
Then I turn around
To see the world is spinning
Have I lost my mind
Or found a new beginning?
--- Unknown ---
When I close my eyes
I see open skies
And feel the ocean calling
And dream that I am falling
I hear a stranger calling me
