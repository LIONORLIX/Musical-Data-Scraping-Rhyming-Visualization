How could I believe
One man could destroy
All my father lived for?
--- Unknown ---
This land that I've loved
This land torn apart
Is this what he died for?
--- Unknown ---
I grew among these people
Now their lives are held in chains
And the houses built wih love
Are prison walls
--- Unknown ---
We believed the land was sacred
Now the land is stained with blood
And where the children once sand hymns
The Devil calls
--- Unknown ---
Hope, building a future
Hope, bound us together
Hope, strong as the will to be here
Time, time, brought us closer
Trust making us stronger
Dreams knowing we could be free here
--- Unknown ---
And the day I left these people
I never thought about my past
It was the only way I thought I could survive.
--- Unknown ---
I turned my back on all they gave me
And I've wasted all these years
But I vow to keep my father's dream alive
This I swear!
--- Unknown ---
Now, nothing else matters
Fear, clear as the sunrise
Strong, all that my father prayed for
Lord, let there be justice
Love, let there be mercy
This is what I was made for
--- Unknown ---
Hope, building a future
Hope, we will be stronger
Hope, strong as the will to be here
Truth, truth is our freedom
Faith, making us stronger
Dreams, knowing we could be free here
--- Unknown ---
By my father's love I swear
By my life, I'll free this land!
