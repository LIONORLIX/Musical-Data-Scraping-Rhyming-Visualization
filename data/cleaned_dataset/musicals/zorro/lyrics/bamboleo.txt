--- Inez ---
When times are hard
You're in disgrace
You're stressed
When days are long
You need a place to rest
When night's are cold
You need your face caressed
What you need,
Is a place to drink!
--- Unknown ---
Garcia: [spoken]
I can't drink while I'm in my uniform!
--- Unknown ---
Inez:[spoken]
Well, I'm sure we can do something about that!
--- Unknown ---
A place where men can dance the night away!
A home from home where men will fight to stay.
A bar, where girls will lead you quite astray!
All you need
Is a drink!
--- Unknown ---
Inez: [spoken]
Well, look if the seargent is drinking the cantina must be officailly open!
--- Unknown ---
There's a tale
Rarely told, about a gypsy
Out the city past midnight
Her smiles are full of secrets
Her lips so full of promise
And she calls
You hear her calling your name
--- Unknown ---
If you look
She is there, while you are dreaming
Dancing in the firelight
The light that catch your shadow
Her beauty's any sunset
--- Unknown ---
And she calls, and she calls, and she calls
STOP
When she calls, when she calls
--- Unknown ---
Bamboleo!

Can you hear her, calling, calling?
And so dance!

She's the moon
And the stars
When they are shining
Knowing all the answers
She sees into the shadows
She listens to the silence
--- Unknown ---
And she calls, and she calls, and she calls
STOP
When she calls, when she calls
--- Unknown ---

She will take you deeper than you've ever been
And if you follow,

She will teach you who you are
And all that you mean

You'll feel her cast her spell
Reveal the hidden truth inside
She lives inside your dreams
