Diego: I'm a fool, nothing more
Who's just living a lie

Will I ever know why?

Both: How can (s)he love me?
How can (s)he ever feel
That (s)he can  trust me?
That my love is my real
Is this a gift that we can never give
Is this a love we'll never live?

Luisa: If we live with regrets
We're not living at all.
Will the fear of betrayl ever fade?
--- Unknown ---
Diego: A chance that is lost
For a liftime
Just a moment
--- Unknown ---
Luisa: A choice we never made
Yet will I ever know the heat at night?

Diego: I could be all she dreams
Play the part

Luisa: Right from the start
Tell me how did he know

Diego: Would she believe me?
--- Unknown ---
Luisa: Don't ever leave me
--- Unknown ---
Diego: Am I right? Too late to reach her heart
--- Unknown ---
Luisa: Never too late
--- Unknown ---
Both: Don't keep us apart!

This is a promise we can never make
This is a silence we can never break
A twist of fate
How can our hearts forgive
This is a love we'll never live
--- Unknown ---
For the dream in my heart
I could never forgive
Is a love that we will never live
