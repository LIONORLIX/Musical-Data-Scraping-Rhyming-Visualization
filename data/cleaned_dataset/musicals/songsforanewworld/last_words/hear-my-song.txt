weary
close
longer
stronger
me
knows
sleeping
crossed
keeping
this
lost
song
tomorrow
song
shine
song
time
go
sing
fine
frightened
dry
singing
bringing
why
arms
you
forget
you
hard
get
song
tomorrow
song
shine
song
times
go
sing
fine

on
tight
now
somehow
light
on
fast
some
come
past
mama
last
song
tomorrow
song
pain
song
have
down
sing
heart
bring
grow
shine
sing
me
fine
