------ Flying Home ------
--- Unknown ---
The angel's called you
To leave this land
My work is finished
My work is finished
The angel's command
--- Unknown ---
I'll come to join you
Reach out your hand
And I'll be flying home
Straight into your arms
And I'll be flying home
Carry me on
Carry me on
And I'm flying home
--- Unknown ---
The angel's called me
To shut the door
We're almost touching
Almost touching
Just one minute more
--- Unknown ---
I'll hear you call me
Just like before
And I'll be flying home
Straight into your arms
And I'll be flying home
Carry me on
Carry me on
And I'm flying home
--- Unknown ---
Carry me on
Speak my name
And I'll rise into the sky
Carry me on
And I'll taste the heavens
Carry me on
And my shame and my fear
Will pass me by
I'm rising, rising
--- Unknown ---
Say the words
And I'll lift into the air
Carry me on
And I'll stay forever
I'm ready Father
Take my hand
I'm ready Father
To fly, to fly
Fly
--- Unknown ---
I'm flying home
Straight into your arms
I'm flying home,
Carry me on
Carry me on
Carry me on
Carry me on
Carry me on
Carry me on
--- Unknown ---
I'm flying, how high I'm flying, home
Straight into your arms
I'm flying how
Carry me on
Carry me on
