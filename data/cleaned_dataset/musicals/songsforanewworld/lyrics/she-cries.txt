------ She Cries ------
--- Unknown ---
There's a couple of things I've learned
On the many roads I've taken
Flames are not what get you burned
It's the cold and the ice
Here's a piece of advice
I got from a little bird
The flames can get you
Stirred
It's the cold that leaves you shaken
--- Unknown ---
I don't like to philosophize
I just want to tell a story
Always leave when a woman cries
Never look in a woman's eyes
You'll get stuck with a high and rising fever
And then you can't leave her
Please, don't wait man
It's almost too late man
--- Unknown ---
She cries and you want to hold her
She lies and you want to run away
But just give her a minute
I promise you're in it to stay
--- Unknown ---
She smiles and you'll stay forever
She screams
Well, that's the price you pay
But there's no one can make you
Forget how you feel
For all she can take
You've got more there to steal
So you don't mind a bit of surprise
And she cries
--- Unknown ---
I don't like to admit I'm wrong
I believe in guts and glory
But it's time I should change my song
I've been here just a bit too long
Always thought I was much too strong for hating
And still I keep waiting...
--- Unknown ---
And while I'm resolving
That door keeps revolving
She cries and you want to hold her
She lies and you're half way out the door
But you never can do it
She'll make you go through it once more
--- Unknown ---
She smiles and you'll stay forever
She sings
Oh, she's got you now for sure
And each time that you swear
That you will not give in
She'll throw you a stare
That'll show you can't win
It's amazing how hard each man tries
But she cries
--- Unknown ---
All of a sudden
You fall for her charms
You promise you'll stop all her tears
All of sudden
She's back in your arms
And the holes start closing
And blacking out the lies
And changing all your dreams
And right before your eyes
--- Unknown ---
She cries
And I don't know the answer
She spies
And there's no place I can hide
When I look in the mirror,
There's nothing but fear here inside
I run
And still she is right behind me
I fall
The chasm is too wide
--- Unknown ---
So I'm stuck in this world of her magic mystique
Where I'll never be more than her toy of the week
But each time I prepare my goodbyes
Well, she catches me looking
And she opens the floodgates
