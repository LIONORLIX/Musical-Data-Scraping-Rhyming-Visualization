Murray,
I am out here Murray
And I am not discussing this anymore
--- Unknown ---
You don't want to buy me the fur?
Well, that's just fine Murray
It's not like I'm asking for much
Since you won't buy me the dog
Or the beach house in Quogue
As if you didn't have the money
What else is new?
--- Unknown ---
I'm not gonna fight for a coat
So never mind, Murray
If that's what's important to you
At least I know where I stand
So, Murray, strike up the band
Because the time has come for action
Here's what I'll do
--- Unknown ---
Clearly, I'm not wanted anymore
Now I'm not so young and beautiful
That's okay, I've faced defeat before
I'm not gonna kvetch
And I'm not gonna cry
It's not gonna get me what I wanted
--- Unknown ---
So I'm simply gonna take one step
One tiny step
And Murray
Just one step, I'll be free
One small step
Just so you shouldn't worry
I'll be free
And you'll be rid of me
Isn't that easy, Murray?
Watch me
--- Unknown ---
You think this is maybe a joke
Well, it's no joke, Murray
Murray
--- Unknown ---
It looks like they're forming a crowd
Like eighty-five at the most
Still, front page of the Post
Ma, I think it's Maury Povich
And Connie too
Oh, hi Connie!
--- Unknown ---
Now you'll finally make your mother proud
Since she never liked me anyway
Look, she's throwing diamonds to the crowd!
--- Unknown ---
Just say the word and I'll come back inside
But until then I'll be happy just to know
That I can always go and take
--- Unknown ---
One step
One tiny step, and Murray
One small step, adios
Just one step,
Honey you'd better hurry
Oh, yes sir,
Better give up that fur
Take it from, Old Murray
Here I...
--- Unknown ---
Whoops, almost fell Murray
The mother of your children
Splattered across Fifth Avenue
In a bloody heap, Murray
And it's all your fault
--- Unknown ---
Yes, it's you who made the money
?Cause it's you who owns the store
So if you don't want to spend it
That's your right
But it's you who bought the penthouse
On the fifty- seventh floor
So goodnight, cheapskate, goodnight
--- Unknown ---
You think I don't know about her?
Well, I do, Murray
You think I don't know about that
Or the things that you say
To your friends every day
I'm embarrassing
I'm fat
I'm demanding
And controlling
And whatever
Perhaps it's true
--- Unknown ---
Here's the place where I get what I've earned
Why keep prying?
Why be miserable?
Lookit, Murray
Somebody's concerned
Trust in the wind
And I'll land in the crowd
No more complaining
I'm trashy and loud
What a sensational fucking experience
Finally, Murray, I'm getting attention
--- Unknown ---
And just one step
Look at where one step leads you
One small step takes you high
Hey, just one step
Down from the man who needs you
--- Unknown ---
Fuck the fur
Just send it down to her
Oh, fair thee well
And Murray, watch me fly
--- Unknown ---
Murray,
Oh, I'm serious Murray
