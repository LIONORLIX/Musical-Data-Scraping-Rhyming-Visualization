------ I'd Give It All For You ------
--- Unknown ---
I had a house while you were gone
The week after you left me
I found a couple acres
Near Sarilla Park
I had a house while you were gone
A house with silver shutters
And a driveway laid in marble
And thousands of rooms to fill
And miles of space to fly
And I tried to believe it,
It was better without you
I was safer alone
--- Unknown ---
No, I'd give it all for you
I'd give it all for you by my side once more
Oh, I'd give it all for you
I'd give it all to hold you again
To feel I'm completed
To know there and then
That all that I needed
Was you to fight the fear
And now you're here
--- Unknown ---
I took a trip while I was gone
I cashed in all my savings
And bought an Eldorado
Drove to Tennessee
I took a trip while I was gone
I drove across the country
And I stopped at lots of diners
And stared at a million stars
And thought I could touch the sky
And I tried to believe it,
It was better without you
I was finally free
--- Unknown ---
No, I'd give it all for you
I'd give it all for you by my side once more
Oh, I'd give it all for you
I'd give it ?cause the mountains I climb
Get higher and higher
I'm running from time
And walking through fire
And dreams just don't come true
But now there's you
--- Unknown ---
God knows it's easy to hide,
Easy to hide from the things that you feel
And harder to blindly trust
What you can't understand
--- Unknown ---
God knows it's easy to run,
Easy to run from the people you love
And harder to stand and fight
For the things you believe
--- Unknown ---
Nothing about us was perfect or clear
But when paradise calls me
I'd rather be here
There's something between us
That nobody else needs to see
--- Unknown ---
There were oceans to cross
There were mountains to conquer
And I stood on the shore
And I stood on the cliff
And the second before I jumped
I knew where I needed to be
--- Unknown ---
Oh, I gave it all for you
I gave it all for you by my side once more
Oh, I gave it all for you
I gave it ?cause it's harder to touch
The things that are dearer
I love you too much
To trust something clearer
I know I fell too far
