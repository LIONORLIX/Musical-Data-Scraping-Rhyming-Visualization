------ King Of The World ------
--- Unknown ---
Once upon a time I had tides to control
I had worlds to win
And stars to ignite
And they threw flowers at my feet
When I walked through the town
--- Unknown ---
Once upon a time I had lives to protect
I had rules to change
And wrongs to set right
And there were people at my side
And there were rivers I could guide
I wanted nothing in return
--- Unknown ---
Let me out of here
Give me back all my dreams
Let me out of here
Let please see the sun
Let me out of here
At least tell me what I did wrong
--- Unknown ---
I'm king of the world
Chief of the sea
High in the wind
At least I used to be
And I'm king of the world
Please set me free
Let me remind them of my promise
Live my given destiny
--- Unknown ---
Once upon a time I had fate in my hands
And the confidence of a million regimes
And they said, Brother you're in charge
We'll follow anything you say
--- Unknown ---
Once upon a time Father said to me,
Child you are everything
That you see in your dreams
And I thought, Jesus, that's the key
There are no walls surrounding me
There are no prisons in this life
--- Unknown ---
Let me out of here
Give me back to the wind
Let me out of here
Let me please see my son
Let me out of here
Don't you understand who I am?
--- Unknown ---
I'm king of the world
Chief of the sea
High in the wind
At least I try to be
And I'm king of the world
Please set me free
I had the power and the promise
Give me back my family
--- Unknown ---
Why are we punished for wanting to explore?
Why am I sitting in this cell?
I was not challenging the system
I was working for the people
I just wanted to be better
--- Unknown ---
Why are we punished for wanting to survive?
Why am I locked behind these bars?
Tell the children I'll return to them
Tell them . . . Someone,
Let them know I will be free
--- Unknown ---
I will not be defeated
I will stand like a mountain
And the road will stretch before me
And they'll know it's time to follow
--- Unknown ---
And we'll lift our eyes
And raise our heads
And face the sun
And tell the future
I'm king of the world
Land of the free
High in the sky
The best that I can be
And I'm king of the world
Watch and you'll see
Nothing can stop me from tomorrow,
Keep me from my destiny
--- Unknown ---
I'm king of the world
I'm king of the world
I'm . . . I'm . . .
