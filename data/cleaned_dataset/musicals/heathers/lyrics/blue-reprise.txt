------ Blue Reprise ------
--- VERONICA ---
What threeway? Nothing happened!
--- HEATHER DUKE ---
I remember differently. I seem to remember there was a-
--- KURT & RAM ---
Big sword fight in her mouth!
--- PREPPY STUD ---
And she allowed it?
--- KURT & RAM ---
Big sword fight in her mouth...
--- HEATHER DUKE & MCNAMARA ---
That sure sounds crowded!
--- KURT ---
And then we both went south
--- RAM ---
And planted our flags
--- KURT ---
My big salami
[KURT & RAM]
Bent her over like origami!
--- ALL ---
Woah, Woah, Woah
Wooooaaaahh!
--- KURT & RAM ---
Everybody was
--- ALL ---
Sword fighting in her mouth
--- KURT, RAM, HEATHERS DUKE & MCNAMARA ---
Yes we're convinced it
--- ALL ---
Went down right in her mouth
--- HEATHER MCNAMARA ---
I hope she rinsed it!
--- KURT & RAM ---
She blew and blew and blew
--- ALL ---
Like they were balloons
[KURT]
She lapped us up
--- RAM ---
Like a hearty stew
--- KURT & RAM ---
She bit off more than she could chew...
--- ALL ---
Woah, woah...
--- HEATHER DUKE ---
She'll do the same for you!
--- ALL ---
She blew not one guy but two
She blew and blew and blew
--- HEATHER DUKE ---
Veronica blew two!
--- ALL ---
She blew not one guy but two
She's like some freak in a zoo
[HEATHER DUKE]
If her mother only knew she blew two!
--- ALL ---
And every word is true
Veronica blew two!
--- HEATHER DUKE ---
Yeaaaahhhhh!
