------ Our Love Is God ------
--- J.D. ---
They made you cry,
but that will end tonight.
You are the only thing that's right
about this broken world.
Go on and cry,
but when the morning comes,
we'll burn it down and then
we'll build the world again...
Our love is God.
--- VERONICA ---
Are you okay?
--- J.D. ---
I was alone.
I was a frozen lake,
but then you melted me awake;
See, now I'm crying too.
You're not alone.
--- VERONICA ---
You're not alone...
--- J.D. ---
And when the morning comes,
--- VERONICA ---
When the morning comes...
--- J.D. ---
We'll burn away that tear,
and raise our city here...
--- VERONICA ---
Raise our city here...
--- J.D. & VERONICA ---
Our love is God.

(Veronica's house. J.D. watches as Veronica calls Kurt and Ram on the phone.)
--- KURT ---
Yeah-lo?
--- VERONICA ---
Hi, Kurt, it's Veronica... how did you guys know it was a fantasy of mine to have two guys at once?
--- KURT ---
Wowuhh... lucky guess?
--- VERONICA ---
If you want it to come true, meet me at the cemetery. At dawn.
--- Unknown ---
(Veronica hangs up)
--- KURT ---
Free pussy!
--- RAM ---
And we don't even have to buy it a pizza!
--- Unknown ---
(They punch it in and exit)
--- J.D. ---
We can start and finish wars,
--- J.D. & VERONICA ---
We're what killed the dinosaurs.
We're the asteroid that's overdue.
The dinosaurs choked on the dust,
they died because God said they must.
The new world needed room
for me and you.
--- J.D. ---
I worship you.
I'd trade my life for yours.
They all will disappear,
we'll plant our garden here:
Our love is God.
--- J.D. & VERONICA ---
[Variously, repeats)
Our love is God.
--- Unknown ---
(J.D. opens up a box and pulls out two pistols. Veronica stares in horrified fascination)
--- VERONICA ---
Whoa. Is that real?
--- J.D. ---
Yeah, but we're filling it with Ich Luge bullets.
--- VERONICA ---
Ich Luge...? What?
--- J.D. ---
My grandad scored them in World War II. They contain a powerful tranquilizer. The Nazis used them to fake their own suicides when the Russians invaded Berlin. We will use them to knock out Ram and Kurt long enough to make it look like a suicide pact. Complete with a forged suicide note.
--- Unknown ---
(Lights up on Kurt and Ram embracing)
--- KURT & RAM ---
Ram and I died because we had to hide our gay forbidden love from a disapproving world.
--- J.D. ---
And when the morning comes,
they'll both be laughing stocks...
--- J.D. & VERONICA ---
So let's go hunt some jocks!
--- Unknown ---
(Cemetery at dawn. Kurt and Ram wait for Veronica)
--- KURT ---
Hi... Veronica.
--- RAM ---
Uh... So do we just whip it out or what?
--- VERONICA ---
Take it slow, Ram. Strip for me.
--- KURT ---
What about you?
--- VERONICA ---
I was hoping you'd rip my clothes off me, sport. Count of three.
--- Unknown ---
(KURT and RAM stand awkwardly in their underpants. RAM giggles in anticipation)
--- VERONICA ---
One... two...
--- J.D. ---
Three.
--- Unknown ---
(J.D. steps out and shoots Ram. Veronica fires at Kurt, missing him. Kurt runs)
--- KURT ---
Aaaugh! Holy crap!
--- J.D. ---
Stay there. I'll get him!
--- Unknown ---
(Veronica, suddenly worried, kicks Ram with her foot)
--- VERONICA ---
Ram? You're just unconscious, right?
Ram? Ram!
--- Unknown ---
(J.D. chases Kurt, who tries to escape by scaling a chain-link fence)
--- J.D. ---
Ger off the fence! Get off the damn fence!
--- KURT ---
I don't understand!
--- J.D. ---
We can start and finish wars.
We're what killed the dinosaurs.
We're the asteroid that's overdue.
--- KURT ---
Stop being a dick!
--- J.D. ---
The dinosaurs will turn to dust.
--- KURT ---
What does that mean?!
--- J.D. ---
They'll die because we say they must.
--- Unknown ---
(J.D. fires; Kurt dies. Veronica runs up)
--- VERONICA ---
What the fuck have you done?!
--- J.D. ---
... I worship you.
I'd trade my life for yours.
We'll make them disappear.
We'll plant our garden here.
--- Unknown ---
(J.D. holds out his hand)
--- J.D. ---
Our love is God.
--- Unknown ---
(Repeats. J.D. holds Veronica in his arms as she sobs in shock and horror)
--- VERONICA ---
Our love is God...
--- J.D. ---
Our love is God.
--- VERONICA ---
Our love is God...
--- J.D. AND VERONICA ---
