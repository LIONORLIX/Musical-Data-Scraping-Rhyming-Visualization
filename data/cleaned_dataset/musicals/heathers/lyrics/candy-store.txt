--- HEATHER CHANDLER ---
Are we gonna have a problem?
You got a bone to pick?
You've come so far,
Why now are
you pulling on my dick?
I'd normally slap your face off,
And everyone here could watch -
But I'm feeling nice.
Here's some advice:
Listen up, Byatch.

HEATHER CHANDLER with HEATHERS DUKE AND MCNAMARA
I like looking hot;
buying stuff they cannot.
I like drinking hard;
maxing Dad's credit card.
I like skipping gym;
scaring her, screwing him.
I like killer clothes;
kicking nerds in the nose!
If you lack the balls,
you can go play dolls -
Have your Mommy fix you a snack.
Whoa, whoa!
Or you could  come smoke,
Pound some rum and coke
in my porsche with the quarterback.
Oh, whoa, oh whoa, oh whoa!
Honey, what you waiting for?
--- ALL THREE HEATHERS ---
Step into my candy store!
Time for you to prove you're
not a loser anymore...
Then step into my candy store!
Guys fall
--- DUKE & MCNAMARA ---
At your feet.
--- DUKE ---
Buy you stuff!
--- MCNAMARA ---
Help you cheat!
--- ALL THREE ---
All you
--- DUKE ---
Have to do:
--- CHANDLER ---
Say goodbye to Shamu.
--- ALL THREE ---
That freak's
--- MCNAMARA ---
Not your friend.
I can tell, in the end,
--- ALL THREE ---
If she
--- DUKE ---
Had your shot,
--- ALL THREE ---
She would leave you to rot!
--- MCNAMARA ---
'Course if you don't care,
Fine. Go braid her hair -
Maybe Sesame Street is on.
--- CHANDLER & DUKE ---
Whoa, whoa!
--- MCNAMARA ---
Or forget that creep,
--- DUKE ---
and get in my Jeep...
--- CHANDLER ---
Let's go tear up someone's lawn!
--- DUKE & MCNAMARA ---
Oh whoa, oh whoa, oh whoa!
--- ALL THREE ---
Honey, what you waiting for?
Welcome to my candy store!
You just gotta prove you're
not a pussy anymore...
Then step into my candy store!

(During the preceding, The HEATHERS slip the note onto MARTHA'S lunch tray. She opens it and reads it...)
--- CHANDLER ---
You can join the team...
--- DUKE & MAC ---
Or you can bitch and moan.
--- CHANDLER ---
You can live the dream...
--- DUKE & MAC ---
Or you can die alone.
--- CHANDLER ---
You can fly with eagles,
--- DUKE & MAC ---
Or if you prefer
--- CHANDLER ---
Keep testing me
--- ALL THREE ---
And end up like her!
--- MARTHA ---
Veronica, look! Ram invited me to his homecoming party! This proves he's been thinking about me!
--- VERONICA ---
(Lamely.) ... Color me stoked.
--- MARTHA ---
I'm so happy.
--- HEATHER DUKE ---
Whoa, whoa, whoa -
Honey what you waiting for! -
--- Unknown ---
(CHANDLER shoves DUKE aside)
--- HEATHER CHANDLER ---
Shut up, Heather.
Step into my candy store!
Whoaaaaaaaaa!
--- DUKE & MAC ---
Oh, oh, oh,
time for you
to prove
you're not
a lame-ass
anymore!
--- ALL THREE ---
Then step into my candy store!
It's my candy store, it's my candy. (x2)
