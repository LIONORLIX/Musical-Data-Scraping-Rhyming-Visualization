------ Dead Girl Walking (Reprise) ------
--- VERONICA ---
[sung] I wanted someone strong who could protect me.
I let his anger fester and infect me.
His solution is a lie.
No one here deserves to die except for me and the monster I created.
Yeah!
Yeah!
Heads up, JD, I'm a dead girl walking!
--- ALL BUT VERONICA ---
[chanted] Hey yo Westerberg!
--- VERONICA ---
Can't hide from me, I'm your dead girl walkin'!
--- ALL BUT VERONICA ---
[chanted] Hey yo Westerberg!
--- VERONICA ---
And there's your final bell,
[school bell rings]
It's one more dance and then farewell,
Cheek to cheek in hell with a dead girl walkin'!
--- HEATHER MCNAMARA ---
[chanted] Come on, Westerberg!
Here we go, Here we go now!
--- MS. FLEMING ---
[spoken] Veronica! Jason Dean told us you'd just committed suicide!
--- VERONICA ---
[spoken] Yeah, well, he's wrong about a lot of things.
--- MS. FLEMING ---
I threw together a lovely tribute, especially given the short notice.
--- VERONICA ---
Ms. Fleming, what's under the gym?
--- MS. FLEMING ---
The boiler room.
--- VERONICA ---
That's it!
--- MS. FLEMING ---
Veronica, what's going on?
--- VERONICA ---
[sung] Got no time to talk
I'm a dead girl walkin'!
--- STUDENTS ---
[chanted] Hey yo Westerberg!
Hey yo Westerberg!
Tell me what's that sound?
Here comes Westerberg
Comin' to put you in the ground!
Go go Westernberg!
Give a great big yell!
Westerberg will knock you out
And send you straight to hell!
--- The boiler room. JD is planting a bomb. Veronica enters ---
--- VERONICA ---
[spoken] Step away from the bomb.
--- JD ---
(spoken) This little thing? I'd hardly call this a bomb. This is just to set off the packs of thermals upstairs in the gym. Those are bombs. People are going to look at the ashes of Westerberg and say there's a school that self-destructed not because society didn't care, but because that school was society. The only place Heathers and Marthas can truly get along is in Heaven!
--- VERONICA ---
[sung] I wish your mom had been a little stronger.
I wish she stayed around a little longer.
I wish your dad were good!
I wish grown-ups understood!
I wish we met before they convinced you life is war!
I wish you?d come with meâ€”
--- JD ---
I wish I had more TNT!
--- STUDENTS ---
[chanted] Hey yo Westerberg!
Hey yo Westerberg!
Tell me what's that sound?
Here comes Westerberg
Comin' to put you in the ground!
Go go Westerberg!
Give a great big yell!
Westerberg will knock you out
And send you straight to -
--- BANG! ---
