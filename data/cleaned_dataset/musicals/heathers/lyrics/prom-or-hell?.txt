Dear Diary,
I'm going steady
Mostly he's awesome
If a bit too rock and roll
--- Unknown ---
Lately he's bumped off
Three of my classmates
God, have mercy on my soul
--- Unknown ---
They were just seventeen
They still had room to grow
They could have turned out good
And now we'll never know
--- Unknown ---
Dear Diary,
My teen angst bullshit has a body count.
