------ Hey, Yo Westerberg ------
--- All ---
Woah--
--- Heather McNamara ---
Tomorrow night's the pep rally!
--- All ---
Woah--
--- Heather McNamara ---
Let's get psyched!
--- All ---
Hey yo, Westerburg
tell me what's that sound?
Here comes Westerburg
comin' to put you in the ground!
Go, go, Westerburg
give a great big yell...
Westerburg will knock you out
and send you straight to hell!
--- JD ---
I now know thee, thou clear spirit.
--- Heather Duke ---
That's from Moby Dick.
--- JD ---
I appreciate a well-read woman.
--- Heather Duke ---
What's in the envelope?
Oh crap.
--- JD ---
Just a tangible reminder that at around
age six, I'm guessing, you and Martha
Dunnstock were friends.
--- Heather Duke ---
Where'd you get these pictures?
Did Veronica give them to you?
What do you want? Money?
--- JD ---
A favor.
--- Heather Duke ---
No way.
--- JD ---
Oh, I really love this one of you and
Martha in the bathtub together.
--- Heather Duke ---
These photos are ancient history.
Nobody cares about the past.
Nobody cares about Martha Dumptruck.
