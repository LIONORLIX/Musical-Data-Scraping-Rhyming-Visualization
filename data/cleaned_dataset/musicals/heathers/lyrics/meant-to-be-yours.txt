------ Meant to Be Yours ------
--- JD ---
Our classmates thought they were signing this petition. You gotta come out here and see what they really signed!
--- Unknown ---
(sung) You chucked me out like I was trash,
For that you should be dead—
But! But! But!
Then it hit me like a flash,
What if high school went away instead’
Those assholes are the key!
They’re keeping you away from me!
They made you blind, messed up your mind
But I can set you free!
--- Unknown ---
You left me and I fell apart,
I punched the wall and cried—
Bam! Bam! Bam!
Then I found you changed my heart and set loose all that truthful shit inside!
And so I built a bomb
Tonight our school is Vietnam!
Let’s guarantee they’ll never see their senior prom!
--- Unknown ---
I was meant to be yours!
We were meant to be one!
Don’t give up on me now!
Finish what we’ve begun!
I was mean to be yours!
--- Unknown ---
So when the high school gym goes boom with everyone inside—
Pchw! Pchw! Pchw!
In the rubble of their tomb
We’ll plant this note explaining why they died!
--- JD AND STUDENTS ---
(spoken) We, the students of Westerburg High
Will die. Our burnt bodies may finally get through
To you. Your society churns out slaves and blanks
No thanks. Signed the Students of Westerburg High
‘Goodbye.’
--- JD ---
(sung) We’ll watch the smoke poor out the doors.
Bring marshmallows,
We’ll make s’mores!
We can smile and cuddle while the fire roars!
--- Unknown ---
I was meant to be yours!
We were meant to be one!
I can’t make this alone!
Finish what we’ve begun!
I am all that you need!
You carved open my heart!
Can’t just leave me to bleed!
--- Unknown ---
Veronica, open the—open the door, please’
Veronica, open the door.
Veronica, can we not fight anymore’
Please, can we not fight anymore’
Veronica, sure, you’re scared,
I’ve been there. I can set you free!
Veronica, don’t make me come in there!
I’m gonna count to three!
(spoken) One! Two! Fuck it!
--- Unknown ---
(JD kicks open the closet door. Veronica dangles from an improvised bedsheet noose)
--- JD ---
(spoken) Oh my God! ‘No! ‘Veronica’!
(sung) Please don’t leave me alone’
You were all I could trust’
I can’t do this alone’
--- JD AND STUDENTS ---
Still I will if I must!
