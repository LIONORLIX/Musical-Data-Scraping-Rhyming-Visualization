------ Freeze Your Brain ------
--- J.D. ---
I've been through ten high schools.
They start to get blurry.
No point in planting your roots,
'cause you're gone in a hurry.
My dad keeps two suitcases packed in the den,
so it's only a matter of when.
I don't learn the names,
don't bother with faces.
All I can trust is this concrete oasis.
Seems every time I'm about to despair,
There's a 7-11 right there.
Each store is the same,
from Las Vegas to Boston,
linoleum aisles that I love
to get lost in.
I pray at my altar of slush;
yeah I live for that sweet
frozen rush...

(J.D. takes a hit of his frozen drink and grimaces.)
--- J.D. ---
Freeze your brain.
Suck on that straw,
get lost in the pain.
Happiness comes
when everythings numbs.
Who needs cocaine?
Freeze your brain.
Freeze your brain...

Care for a hit?

Does your mommy know you eat all this crap?
--- J.D. ---
Not anymore.
When mom was alive,
we lived halfway normal,
but now it's just me and my dad,
we're less formal.
I learned to cook pasta,
I learned to pay rent;
learned the world doesn't
owe you a cent.
You're planning your future,
Veronica Sawyer,
you'll go to some college,
and marry a lawyer.
But the sky's gonna hurt
when it falls.
So you better start
building some walls...
Freeze your brain.
Swim in the ice,
get lost in the pain.
Shut your eyes tight, till you vanish
from sight,
let nothing remain -
Freeze your brain,
shatter your skull,
fight pain with more pain.
Forget who you are,
unburden your load,
forget in six weeks you'll be back on
the road.
When the voice in your head
says you're better off dead,
don't open a vein -
just freeze your brain,
freeze your brain,
Go on and freeze your brain...
