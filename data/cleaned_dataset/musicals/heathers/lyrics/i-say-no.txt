[VERONICA] (spoken)
Oh, Martha was right about you!
--- Unknown ---
[J.D] (spoken)
Now, let's have a real conversation
--- Unknown ---
[VERONICA] (spoken)
Martha was right and I broke her heart!
--- Unknown ---
[J.D] (spoken)
Let's talk about Heather Duke
--- Unknown ---
[VERONICA] (spoken)
No! Let's talk about you!
--- VERONICA ---
You are a drug
You are a poison pill
I've got to kick this habit now
Or else I never will
I loved the rush
When you would hold me close
But you will not be satisfied
Until I overdose
--- Unknown ---
This is it
Hit the brake
I am finally awake
Let me be
Let me go
You need help
I can't provide
I am not qualified
This troubled teen is getting clean
I say no
[J.D] (spoken)
Veronica, who else is gonna be-
--- Unknown ---
[VERONICA] (spoken)
No, no, no, no!
--- VERONICA ---
Donâ€™t say a word
You speak and I cave in
You'll twist the truth again
Drill deep down beneath my skin
You said you'd change
And I believed in you
But you're still using me to justify the harm you do
--- Unknown ---
[J.D] (spoken)
Come on!
--- VERONICA ---
This is it
Hit the brake
Call it all my mistake
Long as you let me go
You need help
I can't provide
I'm not Bonnie
You're not Clyde
It's not too late
I'm getting straight
I say no
Blame your childhood, blame your dad
Blame the life you never had
But hurting people? That's your choice, my friend
'Cause I believe that love will win
And hate will earn you nothing in the end
This is the end
--- Unknown ---
[J.D] (spoken)
But I love you!
--- Unknown ---
[VERONICA] (spoken)
Dude-
--- VERONICA ---
This is it
I won't cry
Starting now, I will try
To pay back
All the karma I owe
Start again
Somewhere new
Far from cool guys like you
So goodbye
'Cause now I'm
Saying no
Just in time
I say no
Somehow I'm saying no
Just say no
I say no
No!
