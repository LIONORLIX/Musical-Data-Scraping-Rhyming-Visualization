Fosca
I am writing to you, Signora
Just as soon as I've arrived
With a most unhappy heart.
Giorgio
God, you are so beautiful -
Fosca
I do not wish to cause you pain -
Giorgio
As I remember every night -
Fosca
So please consider what I say -
Giorgio
Clear and beautiful -
Fosca
With calm.
Giorgio
Every night, every day,
Every part of you -
Fosca
My heart -
Clara
You feel so good -
Fosca
My heart belongs -
Clara
As if you'd never been away -
Fosca
My heart belongs to someone else.
Clara
Your breath so warm
Your touch so sure -
Giorgio
Your skin so delicate...
Clara
Your arms so strong...
Fosca
I am in love, hopelessly in love -
Hopelessly in love, and I am loved
Hopelessly in turn, Signora.
Giorgio, Clara
All this happiness -
Fosca
You and I -
Giorgio, Clara
Being here with you in the dark.
Fosca
We're not meant for each other.
Giorgio, Clara
So much happiness -
Fosca
If I seemed to imply
Something more -
Giorgio, Clara
Even more than what I felt before!
Fosca
I apologize.
Giorgio, Clara
To feel your touch again -
Fosca
But since we're forced to be together -
Giorgio, Clara
When so much time has passed -
Fosca
Let us try to face the fact.
Giorgio, Clara
To dream of you and then to be with you again
And have some time at last...
Fosca
Let us both behave with tact.
Giorgio, Clara
How long were we apart -
Fosca
If this letter seems cold- hearted -
Giorgio, Clara
A month, a week, a day?
Fosca
It conceals my own distress.
Nonetheless -
Giorgio, Clara
To feel your touch again -
Fosca
We must end what never started.
Giorgio, Clara
You've never been away.
Fosca
You must recognize -
Clara
Still, I've missed you -
Fosca
There is nothing -
Giorgio
Hush.
Fosca
Between us.
Clara
- so much.
Fosca
Nothing...
Giorgio
Shhh. I'm here now.
Fosca
Nothing, nothing...
Clara
Welcome home...
(Clara and Giorgio embrace passionately as Fosca,
sone-faced remains alone in her drawing room; her
Attendants ever with a shawl, which they wrap about
her, and a needlepoint frame, which she takes and
begins feverishly working at. Fosca's Attendants
