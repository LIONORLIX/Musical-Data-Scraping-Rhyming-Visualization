------ Is This What You Call Love? ------

Giorgio
Is this what you call love?
This endless and insatiable
Smothering pursuit of me.
You think that this is love?
--- Unknown ---
I'm sorry that you're lonely,
I'm sorry that you want me as you do.
I'm sorry that I fail to feel
The way you want me to feel.
--- Unknown ---
I'm sorry that you're ill,
I'm sorry you're in pain.
I'm sorry that you aren't beautiful.
--- Unknown ---
But yes, I wish you'd go away
And leave me alone!
--- Unknown ---
Everywhere I turn, there you are
This is not love
Just some kind of obsession.
--- Unknown ---
Will you never learn when too far is too far,
Have you no concern
For what I want, what I feel?
Love is what you earn and return
When you care for another
So much that the other's set free.
Don't you see?
Can't you understand?
--- Unknown ---
Love's not a constant demand,
It's a gift you bestow
Love isn't sudden surrender
It's tender and slow, it must grow.
--- Unknown ---
Yet everywhere I go,
You appear or I know you are near
This is now love just a need for possession.
--- Unknown ---
Call it what you will
This is not love, this is a reverse
Like a curse, something out of control
I've begun to fear
For my soul...
(Music stops; a loud clap of thunder is heard.
Trembling, Fosca sudders momentarily and crumples
to the ground. Giorgio turns and sees her lying
there; he crosses the stage past her and begins
to exit. He stops, pauses for a moment, then
reluctantly returns to her, covering her with
his coat. He picks her up and carries her offstage
as the lights fade to black.)
