------ Farewell Letter ------
--- Unknown ---
Clara
Giorgio...
Giorgio... Giorgio...
(Suddenly he remembers Clara's letter;
he opens it and begins to read)
--- Unknown ---
I am writing to you, my angel,
Though not long since you've been gone
With a most unhappy heart.
--- Unknown ---
Because, in truth, as time goes on,
I think of nothing else but you -
And us.
--- Unknown ---
Oh, my love, my sweet, you've changed,
I've watched you change,
You're not the man I thought I knew.
--- Unknown ---
At times, these past few days together,
I would wonder whether you were here
Really here with me.
--- Unknown ---
I thought, was I naive to believe
We'd continue year by year?
Is it over forever?
--- Unknown ---
It seems to me the answer rests with you.
Yes, I have obligations at home, Giorgio,
but my heart is yours. When my son is older,
when he goes off to school, there is the
chance for us to be together. I will make
the sacrifice you ask of me then. Please
understand why I can't now. Will you wait
for me, Giorgio? I have to know. We both
have to know.
--- Unknown ---
Giorgio
Just another love story.
Clara
No one is to blame.
Giorgio
A temporary love story.
Clara
But it needn't end the same.
Giorgio
I thought that we had more.
Clara
We had more -
Giorgio
We had something more -
Both
- than any other love story.
Clara
All that happiness -
Giorgio
You think that this is love?
Clara
- we had then -
Giorgio
This logical and sensible
Practical arrangement -
Clara
We can have that happiness -
Giorgio
- this foregone conclusion -
Clara
- once again!
Giorgio
- You think that this is love?
Love isn't so convenient.
Love isn't something scheduled in advance,
Not something guaranteed you need
For fear it may pass you by.
You have to take a chance,
You can't just try it out.
What's love unless it's unconditional?
--- Unknown ---
Love doesn't give a damn about tomorrow
And neither do I!
--- Unknown ---
Clara
All that happiness -
Giorgio
It was fine.
Clara
- in the past -
Giorgio
I was yours, you were mine.
Clara
That was not just happiness,
Love was in that happiness
That's why it will last.
Giorgio
Love is more, I want more.
Both
I thought I knew what love was -
Clara
I didn't know that
Love was a complication.
Giorgio
I do know that it's
not a negotiation.
Clara
We'll take it in our stride.
Giorgio
What we had -
Clara
You decide.
Giorgio
- wasn't bad.
Clara
We could have everything.
I want you more than anything.
Giorgio
How sad -
Clara
To wait is nothing.
We're young and time is nothing.
Giorgio
- that what we have is nothing...
Clara
Nothing...
Both
Nothing...
(She disappears as the Colonel enters,
brandishing a piece of paper)
Colonel
Bachetti, I found this letter at my cousin's bedside.
This is your signature, isn't it?
Giorgio
Yes.
Colonel
You have taken advantage of my cousin's affections.
Giorgio
That was not my intention, sir. Perhaps you should
discuss this matter with Signora Fosca.
Colonel
My Cousin is asleep. And in any event, I wouldn't
subject her to such a question. No one can make me
believe that a man such as yourself would desire a
woman like Signora Fosca. Would ever write
her a letter like this.
Giorgio
Why is that?
Colonel
The reason seems obvious.
Giorgio
Not to me. Forgive me, but you should not read that
letter, nor should you take it from her room.
Colonel
My cousin is at the end of her life! She does not
deserve to be led on in such a manner!
Giorgio
You don't know your cousin. She is not a child!
She is not just a sick person. Signora Fosca is as
responsible for her actions as I am for mine.
Colonel
You have abused my good faith, come into my house
to dishonor it. Your attitude towards me is nothing
short of contemptuous. I must demand a reparation
from you - and mere words will not suffice.
Giorgio
What? A fight? A duel?
Colonel
I confided you. You know that my cousin has been
taken advantage of before.
We will meet tomorrow mornint at eight,
behind the castle steps.
Doctor
Gentlemen, please. Colonel, there is an explanation.
Captain Bachetti, speak up. Say how she forced you -
Giorgio
Not at all. Nothing was forced on me.
Doctor
Oh please, let's come to our senses here.
Colonel
One thing more. My cousin knows nothing of this discovery.
She must know nothing of what is going to happen.
I need your word on that.
Giorgio
She will not hear of this matter from me.
Colonel
Very well. Tomorrow.
Doctor
It's deplorable that that woman should have brought you to
this. Let's not panic. The Colonel will calm down. There's
still time to explain -
Giorgio
You will arrange for me to see Fosca.
Doctor
Are you totally mad?
Giorgio
Whatever the outcome of this duel, I will never see her again.
You will arrange for me to see her as you did before.
Doctor
