------ Loving You ------
--- Unknown ---
Fosca
Loving you is not a choice,
It's who I am.
--- Unknown ---
Loving you is not a choice
And not much reason to rejoice,
But it gives me purpose
Gives me voice to say to the world:
This is why I live
You are why I live.
--- Unknown ---
Loving you is why I do
The things I do
Loving you is not in my control.
But loving you, I have a goal
For what's left of my life...
--- Unknown ---
I would live,
And I would die for you.
Giorgio
Die for me? What kind of love is that?
Fosca
The truest love. Would Clara give her life for you?
Would she? I would. Happily. In time you will come
to see what is beautiful about me. Do you wish me
to move to another compartment?
Giorgio
We're getting off at the next stop and I'm taking
you back. And then I'll go on to Milan.
You must be cold. Here.
Take this. Can't have you getting more ill, can I?
Fosca
The moonlight makes even this landscape look lovely.
Look over there. There seem to be faces in those rocks.
