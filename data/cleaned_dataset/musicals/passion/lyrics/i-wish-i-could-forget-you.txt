------ I Wish I Could Forget You ------

Fosca
My dearest Fosca...
Please.
Giorgio
'My dearest Fosca'
Fosca
I wish I could forget you.
Erase you from my mind.
But ever since I met you,
I find, I cannot leave the thought of you behind.
That doesn't mean I love you...
Giorgio
That doesn't mean I love you...
Fosca
I wish that I could love you...
--- Unknown ---
I know that I've upset you,
I know I've been unkind.
I wanted you to vanish from sight,
But now I see you in a different light.
And though I cannot love you,
I wish that I could love you.
--- Unknown ---
For now I'm seeing love like none I've ever known.
A love as pure as breath, as permanent as death.
Implacable as stone
A love that, like a knife, has cut into a life
I wanted left alone.
A love I may regret, but one I can't forget.
--- Unknown ---
I don't know how I let you so far inside my mind,
But there you are and there you will stay
How could I ever wish you away?
I see now I was blind.
--- Unknown ---
And should you die tomorrow,
Another thing I see.
Your love will live in me.
I remain... Your Giorgio.
Bring it to me.
Thank you, Giorgio. It's getting light.
You better go. Do you have sisters?
Giorgio
Yes.
Fosca
Do you kiss them goodbye?
Giorgio
Occasionally.
Fosca
Would you kiss me goodbye the way you do them?
No, like you kiss her.
(Fosca suddenly pulls Giorgio to her and embraces him
like a lover. Stunned, he pulls himself away; agitated)
Go now! Go quickly! I'm going to scream!
(Giorgio runs from the room. There is a moment of calm
