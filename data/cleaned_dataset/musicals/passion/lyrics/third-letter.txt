Clara
Clara, I'm in hell,
Giorgio
This is hell,
Soldiers
Living hell.
Clara
Living hell.
This godforsaken place -
Soldiers
This godforsaken place -
Clara
This sterile little town, these pompous little men,
Giorgio
This military madness...
Soldiers
This military madness...
This military...
All
Uniforms, uniforms...
Giorgio
Military madness...
Soldiers
Military madness...
Clara, Giorgio
My days are spent in maneuvers...
Soldiers
Uniforms, uniforms
Clara, Giorgio
My evenings in discussing the day -
Soldiers
This is hell -
Clara
My nights are spent in thinking of you.
Giorgio
Don't forget me, Clara...
Doctor
Good afternoon, Captain.
Giorgio
Doctor.
Doctor
Your troops seem to be responding well to your command.
Giorgio
Thank you, sir.
Doctor
How are you enjoying your new post?
Giorgio
I find everyone most hospitable.
Doctor
Good. Your company at meals has certainly been a welcome
change for me.
Giorgio
Thank you.
Doctor
I trust the occasional outburst from Colonel Ricci's cousin
hasn't unsettled you today.
Giorgio
No. What exactly is wrong with her?
Doctor
She is a kind of medical phenomenon, a walking collection of
all possible illnesses. Her diseases are beyond science...
Giorgio
The screams?
Doctor
Hysterical convulsions. One might say that her nerve endings
are exposed, where ours are protected by a firm layer of skin.
Giorgio
Is she in danger of succumbing to this illness?
Doctor
I don't believe so. Her body is so weak, it doesn't have the
strength to produce a mortal disease.
Giorgio
I don't understand
Doctor
The weak protect themselves. The defensive soldier often lives
longer than the brave one.
Giorgio
Is she young?
Doctor
Late twenties, I would venture.
Giorgio
Pretty?
Doctor
That you must decide for yourself.
Giorgio
You don't suppose that she's the Colonel's lover, do you?
Doctor
Captain Bachetti, it's good to see you enjoy an
occasional bit of gossip.
No need for discomfort, Captain. We're all human. Your
curiousity is understandable. No, I'm afraid Signora Fosca's
physical state prevents her from being anyone's lover. Good day.

(He moves off; bugle calls)
Giorgio
Clara, don't forget me.
Keep me close to you, Clara...
(We segue back to the Colonel's dining room; it is morning.
Rizzolli and Barri are finishing their breakfast as Giorgio
joins them and sits.)
Rizzolli
Late for breakfast, Captain.
Giorgio
I decided to accompany my troups at their morning drill.
Before their weekly maneuvers.
Barri
You're a better officer than I am. I let my sergeant oversee the morning drill.
Lombardi
Well, it looks as if Signora Fosca has
disappointed us once again.
Rizzolli
Why keep setting her place?
Barri
Captain Bachetti, I'm afraid you'll
have to take breakfast alone.
Giorgio
We still have dinner to share, gentlemen.
Rizzolli
Indeed.
Barri
Any chance we might interest you in
a game of cards tonight?
Giorgio
No. I'm not a gambling man.
Rizzolli
The boredom of this place will make a gambler of you yet.
Barri
Good day, Captain.
Giorgio
Gentlemen...
