Let's see if I can make it easier
Do - a deer a female deer
Re - a drop of golden sun
Mi - a name I call myself
Fa - a long long way to run
Sol- a needle pulling thread
La - a note to follow so
Ti - a drink with jam and bread
That will bring us back to Do
Oh Oh Oh

But it doesn't mean anything...
--- MARIA ---
So we put in words,
One word for ev'ry note, like this:
When you know the notes to sing
You can sing most anything.
