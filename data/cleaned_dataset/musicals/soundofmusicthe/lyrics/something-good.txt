------ Something Good ------
--- MARIA ---
Perhaps I had a wicked childhood
Perhaps I had a miserable youth
But somewhere in my wicked miserable past
There must have been a moment of truth
For here you are standing there loving me
Whether or not you should
So somewhere in my youth or childhood
I must have done something good
Nothing comes from nothing
Nothing ever could
So somewhere in my youth or childhood
I must have done something good.

MARIA AND CAPTAIN:
Nothing comes from nothing
Nothing ever could
MARIA:
So somewhere in my youth
CAPTAIN:
Or childhood
MARIA:
I must have done something
