------ Sixteen Going on Seventeen ------
--- ROLF ---
You wait little girl on an empty stage
For fate to turn the light on
Your life little girl is an empty page
That men will want to write on.
--- LIESL ---
Do write on.
--- ROLF ---
You are sixteen going on seventeen
Baby, it's time to think
Better beware be canny and careful
Baby, you're on the brink
You are sixteen going on seventeen
Fellows will fall in line
Eager young lads and roues and cads
Will offer you food and wine
Totally unprepared are you to face a world of men
Timid and shy and scared are you
Of things beyond your ken
You need someone older and wiser
Telling you what to do
I am seventeen going on eighteen
I'll take care of you.
--- LIESL ---
I am sixteen going on seventeen
I know that I'm na?ve
Fellows I meet may tell me I'm sweet
And willingly I believe
I am sixteen going on seventeen
Innocent as a rose
Bachelor dandies drinkers of brandies
What do I know of those?
Totally unprepared am I
To face a world of men
Timid and shy and scared am I
Of things beyond my ken
I need someone older and wiser
Telling me what to do
You are seventeen going on eighteen
