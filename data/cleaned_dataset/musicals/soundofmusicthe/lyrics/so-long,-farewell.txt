------ So Long, Farewell ------
--- THE CHILDREN ---
There's a sad sort of clanking
From the clock in the hall
And the bells in the steeple too.
And up in the nursery an absurd little bird
Is popping up to say cukoo!
Cukoo! Cukoo!
Regretfully they tell us
--- Unknown ---
But firmly they compel us
To say goodbye to you.
--- Unknown ---
So long
Farewell
Aufwiedersehn
Goodnight
I hate to go and leave this pretty sight
--- Unknown ---
So long
Farewell
Aufwiedersehn
Adeiu
Adeiu Adeiu
To yieu and yieu and yieu
--- Unknown ---
So long
Farewell
Au 'voire
Aufwiedersehn
I'd like to stay and taste my first champagne
--- Unknown ---
So long
Farewell
Aufwiedersehn
Goodbye
I leave and heave a sigh and say goodbye
--- Unknown ---
Goodbye!
--- Unknown ---
I'm glad to go I cannot tell a lie
I flit I float
I fleetly flee I fly
--- Unknown ---
The sun has gone to bed and so must I
So long Farewell
Aufwiedersehn
Goodbye--
--- Unknown ---
Goodbye...
Goodbye...
Goodbye...
