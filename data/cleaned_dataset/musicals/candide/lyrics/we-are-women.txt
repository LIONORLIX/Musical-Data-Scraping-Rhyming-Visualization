------ We Are Women ------
--- CUNEGONDE, OLDLADY ---
We are women! We are women!
We are women, little women,
Little, little women are we!
--- OLD LADY ---
Not a man ever born ever could resist
A well-turned calf, a slender wrist,
A silhouette as airy as the morning mist,
And a dainty dimpled knee.
--- CUNEGONDE ---
Every male I may meet must acclaim for weeks
My twinkling thighs, my flaxen cheeks,
My memorable mammaries like Alpine Peaks,
High above a wine-dark sea.
--- OLDLADY, CUNEGONDE ---
We've necks like swans, and oh, such sexy legs,
We're so light-footed we could dance on eggs. (They do.)
A pair of nymphs from fairyland
And every day in every way our charms expand!
--- Unknown ---
You may add, if you wish, to that growing list
A mouth so fair it must be kissed
And parts we cannot mention but we know existIn a rich abundancy.
Not a man ever born ever could resist
A pretty little thing like me!

Not a man ever born ever could resist
A well-turned calf, a slender wrist, etc.
--- CUNEGONDE ---
Every male I may meet must acclaim for weeks
My twinkling thighs, my flaxen cheeks, etc.
--- OLD LADY ---
We've Giotto hands, da Vinci smiles,
We are brava divina to balletophiles.
--- CUNEGONDE ---
We've Giotto hands, and Mona Lisa smiles,
We are brava divina to balletophiles. (They dance.)
--- OLDLADY, CUNEGONDE ---
A pair of nymphs from fairyland, etc.
We are women! We are women!
We are little, little women,
Little, little, little women are we!
