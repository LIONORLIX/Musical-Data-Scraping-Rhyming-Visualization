------ My Love ------
--- GOVERNOR ---
Poets have said love is undying,
My love!
Don't be mislead, they were all lying,
My love!
Love's on the wing
But now while it hovers
Let us be lovers!
One soon recovers,
My love!
--- Unknown ---
Soon the fever's fled
For love's a transient blessing
Just a week in bed
And we'll be convalescing!
Why talk of morals when springtime is flying?
Why end in quarrels, reproaches and sighing,
Crying
For love!!!!!!!!
My love!

MAXIMILLIAN (dressed as a female slave)
I cannot entertain
Your shocking proposition.
How could I regain
My virginal condition?
I am so pure that before you may bed me
You must asure me that first you will wed me!
Wed me!
--- GOVERNOR ---
Well, then,
Since you're so pure I shall betrothe you,
My love!
Though I feel sure I'll come to loathe you,
My love!
Still, for the thrill
I'm perfectly willing!
So if we must wed
Before we may bed
Then, come let us wed,
