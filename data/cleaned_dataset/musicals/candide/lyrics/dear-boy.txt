------ Dear Boy ------
--- PANGLOSS ---
Dear boy, you will not hear me speak
With sorrow or with rancor
Of what has shrivelled up my cheek
And blasted it with canker;
--- Unknown ---
Twas Love, great Love, that did the deed,
Through Nature's gentle laws,
And how should ill effects proceed
From so divine a cause?
--- Dear boy ---
Sweet honey comes from bees that sting,
As you are well aware;
To one adept in reasoning,
Whatever pains disease may bring
Are but the tangy seasoning
To Love's delicious fare.
Dear boy.
--- CHORUS ---
Sweet honey comes from bees that sting.
--- PANGLOSS ---
Columbus and his men, they say,
Conveyed the virus hither,
Whereby my features rot away
And vital powers wither;
--- Unknown ---
Yet had they not traversed the seas
And come infected back,
Why, think of all the luxuries
That modern life would lack!
--- Dear boy ---
All bitter things conduce to sweet,
As this example shows;
Without the little spirochete,
We'd have no chocolate to eat
Nor would tobacco's fragrance greet
The European nose.
Dear boy.
--- CHORUSA ---
ll bitter things conduce to sweet.
--- PANGLOSS ---
Each nation guards its native land
With cannon and with sentry,
Inspectors look for contraband
At every point of entry,
Yet nothing can prevent the spread
Of Love's divine disease;
--- Unknown ---
It rounds the world from bed to bed
As pretty as you please.
Dear boy:
Men worship Venus everywhere,
As may be plainly seen;
--- Unknown ---
Her decorations which I bear
Are nobler than the croix de guerre,
And gained in service of our fair
And universal Queen.Dear boy.
--- CHORUS ---
Men worship Venus everywhere.Dear boy!
