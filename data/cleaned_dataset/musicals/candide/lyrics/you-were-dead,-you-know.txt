------ You Were Dead, You Know ------
--- CANDIDE ---
Oh.
Is it true?
Cunegonde! Cunegonde! Cunegonde!
--- CUNEGONDE ---
Oh.
Is it you?
Candide! Candide! Can...
--- CANDIDE ---
Oh.
Is it true?
Cunegonde!
Oh my love, dear love!
--- CUNEGONDE ---
Oh.
Is it you?
Candide!
Dear, my love!
--- CANDIDE ---
Dearest, how can this be so?
You were dead, you know.
You were shot and bayoneted, too.
--- CUNEGONDE ---
That is very true.
Ah, but love will find a way.
--- CANDIDE ---
Then what did you do?
--- CUNEGONDE ---
We'll go into that another day.
Now let's talk of you.
You are looking very well.
Weren't you clever, dear, to survive?
--- CANDIDE ---
I've a sorry tale to tell;
I escaped more dead than alive.
--- CUNEGONDE ---
Love of mine, where did you go?
--- CANDIDE ---
Oh, I wandered to and fro...
--- CUNEGONDE ---
Oh, what torture, oh, what pain...
--- CANDIDE ---
Holland, Portugal and Spain...
--- CUNEGONDE ---
Ah, what torture...
--- CANDIDE ---
Holland, Portu...
--- CUNEGONDE ---
Ah, what torture...
--- CANDIDE ---
I would do it all again
To find you at last!
--- CANDIDE, CUNEGONDE ---
Reunited after so much pain;
But the pain is past.
We are one again!
We are one at last!
One again, one at last!
