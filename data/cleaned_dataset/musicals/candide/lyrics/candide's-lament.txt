------ Candide's Lament ------
--- CANDIDE ---
Cunegonde!
Cunegonde, is it true?
Is it you so still and cold, love?
Could our young joys, just begun,
Not outlast the dying sun?
--- Unknown ---
When such brightness dies so soon
Can the heart find strength to bear it?
Shall I ever be consoled, love? No, I swear it
By the light of this lover's moon.
Though I must see tomorrow's dawn,
My heart is gone where you are gone.
--- Unknown ---
Shall I ever be consoled, love? No, I swear it
By the light of this lover's moon.
Good-bye, my love, my love, good-bye.
