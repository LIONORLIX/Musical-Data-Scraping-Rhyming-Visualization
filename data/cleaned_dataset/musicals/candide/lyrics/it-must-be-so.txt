------ It Must Be So ------
--- Unknown ---
(Candide's Meditation)
CANDIDE
My world is dust now,
And all I loved is dead.
Oh, let me trust now
In what my master said:
There is a sweetness in every woe.
It must be so. It must be so.
The dawn will find me
Alone in some strange land.
But men are kindly;
They'll give a helping hand.
So said my master, and he must know.
It must be so. It must be so.
