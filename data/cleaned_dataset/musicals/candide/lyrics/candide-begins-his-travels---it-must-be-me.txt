------ Candide Begins His Travels - It Must Be Me ------
--- CANDIDE ---
My master told me
That men are loving-kind;
Yet now behold me,
III-used and sad of mind.
--- Unknown ---
Men must have kindness
I cannot see.
It must be me.
It must be me.
--- Unknown ---
My master told me
The world is warm and good;
It deals more coldly
Than I had dreamt it would.
--- Unknown ---
There must be sunlight I cannot see.
It must be me.
It must be me.
