------ Bon Voyage ------
--- CHORUS ---
Bon voyage, dear fellow,
Dear benefactor of your fellow man!
May good luck attend you.
Do come again and see us when you can.
--- VANDERDENDUR ---
Oh, but I'm bad. Oh, but I'm bad,
Playing such a very dirty trick on such a fine lad!
I'm a low cad, I'm a low cad,
Always when I do this sort of thing it makes me so
sad,
Ever so sad! Oh, but I'm bad! Ever so bad!
Bon voyage!
--- CHORUS ---
Bon voyage!
Bon voyage, we'll see ya.
Do have a jolly trip across the foam!
Santa Rosalia,
Do have a safe and pleasant journey home.
Bon voyage, bon voyage.
--- VANDERDENDUR ---
I'm so rich that my life is an utter bore;
There is just not a thing that I need.
My desires are as dry as an applecore,
And my only emotion is greed.
Which is why, though I've nothing to spend it for,
I have swindled this gold from Candide,
Poor Candide!
--- Unknown ---
But I never would swindle the humble poor,
For you can't get a turnip to bleed.
When you swindle the rich you get so much more,
Which is why I have swindled Candide.
Oh dear, I fear
He's going down, he's going to drown!
Ah, poor Candide!
--- CHORUS ---
Bon voyage, dear stranger,
Hope that the crossing will not prove too grim.
You seem to be in danger,
But we expect that you know how to swim.
--- VANDERDENDUR ---
What a dumb goat, what a dumb goat,
Handing me a fortune for a perfect wreck of a boat.
Never did float, never did float.
This is going to make a most amusing anecdote.
Never did float, wreck of a boat. What a dumb goat!
--- ALL ---
Bon voyage!
Bon voyage, best wishes!
Seems to have been a bit of sabotage
Things don't look propitious,
Still from the heart we wish you
Bon voyage, dear fellow, bon voyage!!
