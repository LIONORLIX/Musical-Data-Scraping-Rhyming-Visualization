Rien ne va plus. Le treize...

Banco!
--- OLD LADY ---
I've got troubles, as I've said:
Mother's dying, Father's dead.
All my uncles are in jail.
--- CANDIDE ---
It's a very moving tale.
--- OLD LADY ---
Though our name, I say again, is
Quite the proudest name in Venice,
Our afflictions are so many,
And we haven't got a penny.
--- CANDIDE ---
Madam, I am desolate
At your family's tragic state.
Any help that I can give...
Please do tell me where they live.
I shall look them up tomorrow
And alleviate their sorrow
With a check made out to bearer.
In the meantime, buona sera.

--- CUNEGONDE, OLD LADY ---
Although our name, I say again, is
Quite the proudest name in Venice,
All our uncles are in jail.
It is a very moving tale.
--- CANDIDE ---
Ah, what a tale!
Ah, what a moving tale.
--- PANGLOSS ---
Millions of rubles and lire and francs,
Broke the bank, broke the bank,
Broke the best of all possible banks.
Pieces of gold to the ladies I throw;
Easy come, easy go.
Shining gold to the ladies I throw.
See them on their knees before me.
If they love me, can you blame them?
Little wonder they adore me.
Watch them woo me as I name them:
Lady Frilly, Lady Silly,
Pretty Lady Willy-Nilly,
Lady Lightly, Lady Brightly,
Charming Lady Fly-by-Nightly.
My Lady Fortune found me.
What a joy to have around me
Lovely ladies, six or seven;
This is my idea of Heaven.
Fortune, keep the wheel a-spinning,
They adore me while I'm winning!
Lady Frilly, Lady Silly,
Pretty Lady Willy-Nilly,
Lady Lightly, Lady Brightly,
Charming Lady Fly-by-Nightly.
Fools love only one or two.
Ladies, I love all of you.

She's got troubles, as she said:
Mother is dying, Father's dead.
All her uncles are in jail.
It's a very moving tale.
Although her name, she says again, is
Quite the proudest name in Venice,
All her uncles are in jail.
It's a very moving tale.
