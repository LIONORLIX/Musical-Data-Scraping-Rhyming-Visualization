------ In The Middle Of The Room ------
--- Gordon ---
Here I sit in the middle of the room,
I don't throw a fit,
And I don't start crying.
Nurses flit as they fiddle in the room.
It's a damn charade that I can't abide.
Froggy came, froggy went,
I resent his appearance.
Slicing veins, tricky shit!
That is what he said!
Fact remains I could soon be dead.
In the middle of my gloom, in the middle of my fright,
In the middle of my room, in the middle of the night.
--- Mimi ---
Here I stand in the middle of the road,
--- Gordon ---
In the middle of the room,
--- Mimi ---
And I'm waiting for a car,
--- Gordon ---
And I'm waiting for a shot.
--- Mimi ---
To come along and kill me.
--- Gordon ---
Nurse, please!
--- Mimi ---
People ask why I'm standing in the road
--- Gordon ---
Sitting in the room.
--- Mimi ---
And I say because,
--- Gordon ---
I'm afraid of what I've got.
--- Mimi ---
I'm frightened he will die.
--- Gordon ---
I'll die.
--- Gordon and Mimi ---
Kill me please, straight ahead, make me dead, get it over with.
--- Mimi ---
I just called to tell you every thing's gonna be alright.
--- Gordon ---
Ma, you sound foolish.
--- Mimi ---
Mother will protect, mothers gonna fix things,
anything that's wrecked, mothers gonna make things-
--- Gordon ---
Mother! please, say goodbye, ma a heart to heart.
When I die, you can't fall apart.
--- Mimi ---
What a stupid thing to say, rather stab me with a knife, what an ignorant display,
in the middle of your life, the middle of your, in the middle of your life.
--- Gordon ---
It is not the middle of my life, mother! I'm dying!
--- Mimi ---
