------ Just Go ------
--- GORDON ---
Go
Look at me just go
Don?t say anything just go
I can?t even walk across the room unassisted, so go
Go away, there?s nothing left to say
You won?t have to walk and hold my elbow
Hell no, just go
--- Unknown ---
Don?t
Please don?t touch my skin
Because up to now I?ve been very strong
And so heroic you wouldn?t recognise me, go
Go, goodbye
Cos if you make me cry
Then I?ll probably have to kill you
I will you know
Just go
--- ROGER ---
Sometimes you?re a doozy
Sometimes when you talk
I get so damn woozy
You?re so crazy
--- GORDON ---
I am only a little crazy
--- ROGER ---
Go ahead and use me
Make a pass and I will save you ass

GORDON [ROGER]
Go
Look at me just go [I?m not going nowhere]
Just go [And someone will hold you, later on]
I can?t even walk across the room unassisted, so go
Go, goodbye
Cos if you make me cry [Later on]
Then I?ll probably have to kill you [And I?ll probably have to kill you]
I will you know
Just go
[No]
No
[Shmo]
