Yes, yes
Yes is a very special word

Yes I will do that
Yes I will go there
Yes I will live a good and a true life
Yes I?ll survive

When there?s a moment
Grab it and shake it
Take it in your hand
Yes I will

MR. BUNGEE (spoken as everyone else is singing)
No, no.
No, no, no!
No, no, no!
What is this nonsense about virginity?
It?s a goddamn children?s show!
I never know what the hell you?re writing about (all else is silent) Schwinn.
I want a song! A song, yes.
Yes, I will do my homework. Yes I will work in the garden.
Yes I will go with my grandparents to Israel.
Instead I get this nonsense about somebody
who loses their virginity to those with whom they have no affinity.
Affinity! It?s a goddamn children?s show!
Alright, look. I know you?re in the hospital. You?ve got this brain thing.
And you know what? I?m gonna get my son to write the song.
Where?s my son?!
Where?s my son?!
