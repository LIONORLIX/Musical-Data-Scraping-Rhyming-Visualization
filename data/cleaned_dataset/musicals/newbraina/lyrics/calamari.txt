--- GORDON SCHWINN ---
Sorry I'm late, Rhoda.
--- RHODA ---
You're always late.
--- GORDON SCHWINN ---
I was working on the spring song.
Is he angry that he doesn't have the Spring Song yet?  I bet.
--- RHODA ---
No, he's angry that he doesn't have the yes song.
--- GORDON SCHWINN ---
I hate the Yes Song.
I hate the Spring Song.
I hate Mr. Bungee and his job.
It's bad, working on Mr. Bungee's lilypad.
--- WAITRESS ---
Y'all work for Mr. Bungee?  I love that tv show!
The specials today, though not many, are especially good.
First, the fish of the day- Calamari!
Which isn't a fish, but lives in the sea,
as set in the dish, it happens to be
the fish of the day.
Okay.
Plus there's ziti with a sauce that's meaty.  It's fun!
--- SCHWINN AND RHODA ---
Fun?
--- WAITRESS ---
And there's a lot.
And that's the specials!
Thank you!
--- GORDON SCHWINN ---
I'll have the ziti, and a diet coke.
--- RHODA ---
Uh okay, and I will have the goat cheese salad.  No cheese.
--- GORDON SCHWINN ---
Thank you.
--- RHODA ---
So talk to me.
--- GORDON SCHWINN ---
It's taking up the brunt of my time.
--- RHODA ---
It's called a job.
--- GORDON SCHWINN ---
I don't have time to write my real stuff.
It feels like I can't express what I mean to convey
so of course I didn't write enough today!
--- RHODA ---
If you don't keep writing you'll be shown the door.
You know Mr. Bungee hates you.
--- GORDON SCHWINN ---
I think Mr. Bungee...
--- RHODA ---
...I think he hates you more
--- GORDON SCHWINN ---
Why does Mr. Bungee hate me?
--- RHODA ---
First off:  You've gotta finish a song
You scoff, but damnit, write the Spring Song!
Write the Yes Song
Don't let your career go to the dogs!
--- GORDON SCHWINN ---
As you can tell, I don't write well for frogs.
--- Unknown ---
"Mr. Bungee is aquatic and dispotic."
--- Unknown ---
I'm getting frog hallucinations!
--- Unknown ---
"Mr. Bungee's oceanic and satanic!  ahaha.
Mr. Bungee's said to be tyrannical at times.  But Mr. Bungee always rhymes!
--- Unknown ---
He's not here right now, is he?
--- WAITRESS ---
I love Mr. Bungee, yes indeedy, here's your ziti!
I love Mr. Bungee when he makes his scene.
I love Mr. Bun- did someone order scallopini?
I love Mr. Bungee, here's your diet coke and here's your drinks.
I love Mr. Bungee, I love Mr. Bungee!
--- RHODA ---
First write your song then next you'll write the epic.
First tv then next a Broadway show.
It's a rocky road from lilypad to where you want to get to dear,
but Rhoda always knows.
--- GORDON SCHWINN ---
Inside me I feel washed up and through.
--- RHODA ---
Oh come on...
--- GORDON SCHWINN ---
Writing this shit's killed my talent.
--- RHODA ---
That is not true!
--- GORDON SCHWINN ---
And whatever's left to kill then Bungee will
grind that down to squat!
I used to be..
--- RHODA ---
You still-
--- GORDON SCHWINN ---
I was!
--- RHODA ---
I don't agree-
--- GORDON SCHWINN ---
I once was but I'm not!
--- Unknown ---
Oh my-
--- RHODA ---
Hey come on, sit down.
--- GORDON SCHWINN ---
Something is wrong...
--- RHODA ---
Gordon, are you okay?
--- GORDON SCHWINN ---
Something is wrong...
--- RHODA ---
