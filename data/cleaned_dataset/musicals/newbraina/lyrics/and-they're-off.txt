------ And They're Off ------
--- GORDON ---
Ponies in the sun
The race is soon beginning
My father bet the fam?ly fortune
On a sleek brown horse
My father had a hunch
We gave up lunch
So daddy could make a wager
Ma would scoff
She would scoff
hear her scoff
And they?re off
--- OTHERS ---
La la la la la la la la
--- GORDON ---
Yeah, they?re off
--- OTHERS ---
La la la la la la la la la la la
--- GORDON ---
And they move in a herd
Like a four-letter word
And they?re off
--- OTHERS ---
La la la la
--- GORDON ---
Tickets flow to the ground
And the band starts to play as the horses go round
--- ALL ---
And they?re off
--- GORDON ---
Mommy sat and cried
But dad was unaffected
He said,
?Have you ever had a better two minutes
In the last three years??
we said,
?But dad, the dumb horse lost.?
He said,
?Sometimes joy has a terrible cost.
I know that
Ma would scoff
Woo she would scoff
Hear her scoff
And they?re off
--- OTHERS ---
La la la la la la la la
--- GORDON ---
Yeah, they?re off
--- OTHERS ---
La la la la la la la la la la la
--- GORDON ---
Mommy?s biting his neck
As they roll on the deck
And they?re off
--- OTHERS ---
La la la la
--- GORDON ---
there is blood on the ground
And the band starts to play as the horses go round
--- ALL ---
And they?re off
--- GORDON ---
Isn?t life funny?
People lose money
And have fun
--- Unknown ---
Betting of course is
Hell on the horses
And on families where the betting is done
It?s a joke to believe someone?s won
--- Unknown ---
All they did was fight
Plus they discussed the weather
My father bet the family fortune
?Til it disappeared
We also laughed a lot
That was the thing I often forgot
To tell you
But it?s true
Yes, it?s true
It is true
And he?s off
--- OTHERS ---
La la la la la la la la
--- GORDON ---
Daddy?s off
--- OTHERS ---
La la la la la la la la la la la
--- GORDON ---
We get letters from maine
Where he tries to explain
Why he?s off
--- OTHERS ---
La la la la
--- GORDON ---
What was lost, was not found
And the band starts to play as the horses go round
--- ALL ---
And they?re o-o-o-o-o-off
--- GORDON ---
And they?re off!
--- OTHERS ---
i hear the bell at the starting gate
--- GODON ---
Hey, they?re off
--- OTHERS ---
we're salivating as their moving moving down
--- GORDON ---
And they move in a herd
Like a four-letter word
And they?re off
--- OTHERS ---
Coming down the stretch
--- GORDON ---
Then there?s blood
--- OTHERS ---
Then there?s blood
--- GORDON ---
On the ground
--- OTHERS ---
On the ground
--- GORDON ---
And the band starts to play as the horses go round
And round
--- OTHERS ---
And round
--- GORDON ---
And around
--- OTHERS ---
And around
--- GORDON ---
And around
--- OTHERS ---
And around
--- GORDON ---
And around
--- OTHERS ---
And around
--- GORDON ---
And around?
--- Unknown ---
OTHERS (as Gordon sings)
And round and round and round and round and round and round-
--- ALL ---
And they?re off!
