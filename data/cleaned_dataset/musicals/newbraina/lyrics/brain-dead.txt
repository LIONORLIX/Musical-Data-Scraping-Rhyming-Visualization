Brain dead, thats what i am lying here
i'm brain dead what a mess i've got us into
I'm brain dead everybody's setting off alarms.
Baby mabey lift my head up.
I see, I just pulled a doozey, don't ask why me.
Roger pass the oozi as the MD, lifts me in his cruzy chizzled arms.
Brain dead, stupid and thoughtless is what i am.
Cause i'm brain dead and god damn.

Gordon
Instead scream your accusations, don't be well bred
Life ain't always happiness and plight.
I thought if i could finish a song... or five
I'd be brain dead but alive.

Last scene, everybodys dancing I take codiene.
Oh, lovers start romancing!
There's a bright green, thing between your teeth dear,

Waiter later please we're fighting!
Crash! Bang! At this speed it's stimulating.
Crash! Bang! I'm out here hallucinating!
Crash! Bang! Actually im going out in style!
That said, Please someone kill me if I survive!
