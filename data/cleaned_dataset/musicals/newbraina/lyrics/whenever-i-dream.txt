------ Whenever I Dream ------
--- Unknown ---
Whenever I dream, I dream pornographically explicit
I dream I'm a horse, which is probably a penis, but is it?
is it? I don't know.
Things that I think mean one thing sometimes do sometimes dont
The world is a confusing place to live in
But what I mean is, we get by
In my dreams, I'm always up and walking
Self assured, self decieved, not about to die
But when I wake its gone
And then I carry on
Whenever I dream, I dream I'm not writing something tawdry
I write about how I'm a cow, then I become my cousin Audrey
Tawdry? Yes it is.
Things that I think mean one thing sometimes do sometimes dont
The world is a confu-blah blah live in
But up there no one understands
In my dreams I'm all composed, composing
At the keys, symphonies drip from these two hands
But when I wake, its gone
And then I carry on
Whenever I dream, whenever I laugh, Whenever I scream, Whenever I  eat,
Whenever I spring, Whenever I fart, Whenever I spring, Whenever I  dream, Whenever I
dream, Whenever I dream, Whenever aye-yaye-yaye-yaye-yaye
Whenever I dream, whenever I laugh, whenever I spring, whenever I eat,
whenever I spring, whenever I fart, whenever I spring, whenever I dream, whenever I
dream, whenever I dream, Whenever aye-yaye-yaye-yaye-yah
