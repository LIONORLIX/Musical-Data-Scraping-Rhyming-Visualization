------ Eating Myself Up Alive ------
--- Richard ---
I?m eating myself up alive.
Learning to drink,
bitting my finger,
eat, eat, eat, eat,
eating myself up alive.
--- Unknown ---
I?m eating myself up alive.
Memories stink,
memories linger.
Eat, eat, eat, eat,
eating myself up alive.
--- Unknown ---
Where the hell?s my sense of humor?
--- Nancy,Min.,Doctor&Lisa ---
Oh. Ah.
--- Richard ---
Where the hell?s my drive?
--- Unknown ---
Watching TV,
Tossing in bed,
eating myself up alive.
--- Unknown ---
Tell me the truth,
was it something I said?
--- Unknown ---
Eating and eating and
eating myself up alive.
--- Nancy,Min.,Doctor&Lisa ---
Eat, eat, eat.
Eat, eat, eat.
Eat, eat, eat.
Eat, eat, eat.
--- Richard ---
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh.
Eating myself up alive.
--- Nancy,Min.,Doctor&Lisa ---
Eat, eat, eat.
Eat, eat, eat.
Eat, eat, eat.
Eat, eat, eating myself up alive!
--- Richard ---
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh.
Eating myself up alive.
--- Unknown ---
It?s awful to always be nice.
Sometimes I fail.
Sometimes I?m stinky
Eat, eat, eat, eat,
eating myself up alive.
--- Unknown ---
I?m paying a terrible price.
Biting the nail
off of my pinky.
Eat, eat, eat, eat,
eating myself up alive.
--- Unknown ---
If I?ve lost my sense of humor,
how will I survive?
--- Nancy,Min.,Doctor&Lisa ---
Oh. Ah.
--- Richard ---
Grinding my teeth,
throwing a fit,
eating myself up alive.
--- Nancy,Min.,Doctor&Lisa ---
Eating myself up!
--- Richard ---
Is there a food we adore more than chocolate?
Eating and eating and
eating myself up alive.
--- Nancy,Min.,Doctor&Lisa ---
Eat, eat, eat.
Eat, eat, eat.
Eat, eat, eat.
Eat, eat, eat.
--- Richard ---
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh.
Spell it!
--- Nancy,Min.,Doctor&Lisa ---
Eat, eat, eat.
Eat, eat, eat.
Eat, eat, eat.
Eat, eat, eat.
