------ Poor, Unsuccessful And Fat ------
--- RICHARD ---
Time for your sponge bath
--- GORDON ---
Aw, must I?
--- RICHARD ---
Honey, I don’t wanna be here either
--- Unknown ---
Poor Unsuccessful and Fat
Who would’ve thought I would end like that?
Surely, in no time, you’ll be back to normal
In your evening formal
I’ll be Poor Unsuccessful
Poor Unsuccessful and Fat
And getting older
--- GORDON ---
All right, come on
--- RICHARD ---
Hello
Plus, have you noticed I sweat?
--- GORDON ---
Hello
--- RICHARD ---
I have a list of things I regret
Don’t tell this story to little children
Cause it’s gonna scare them
How I’m Poor Unsuccessful
Poor Unsuccessful and Fat
--- Unknown ---
And getting older, getting greyer
Stop me if you’ve heard this before
Cause if you’ve heard this before
Hell it’s just more of the same
--- GORDON ---
Well
--- RICHARD ---
Help me
I’m a player
Who’ll never make it, I won’t make, I won’t make it
--- GORDON ---
NO NO NO NO NO NO
--- RICHARD ---
Once I was practically thin
--- GORDON ---
OH….
--- RICHARD ---
Now I can eat like I’m Rin Tin Tin
Soon you’ll be back home
A success in training
I’ll be here complaining
That I’m Poor Unsuccessful
Poor Unsuccessful and Faaaaattttt
And getting older
--- GORDON ---
I am not successful
I am not so damn successful
--- RICHARD ---
I’m getting older
--- GORDON ---
I am not successful
I am not so damn successful
--- RICHARD ---
I’m getting older
--- MR. BUNGEE ---
You’re not successful
--- GORDON ---
I am not successful
--- MR. BUNGEE ---
You’re too old to be a failure
--- GORDON ---
I’m too old to be a failure
--- MR. BUNGEE ---
Your futures looking cloudy
--- GORDON ---
My future’s looking cloudy
--- MR. BUNGEE ---
Your sister is a whore
--- GORDON ---
My sister’s a receptionist!
--- MR. BUNGEE ---
Bet your tush you’re unsuccessful
Don’t mean to make this more stressful than it’s already become
But you’re Poor Unsuccessful and Dumb
Poor Unsuccessful and Dumb
and Untalented
Poor Unsuccessful and Dumb
and Untalented
Almost psychotically grim and untalented
That’s what we say about him he’s untalented
