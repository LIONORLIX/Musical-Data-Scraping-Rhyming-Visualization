------ Trouble In His Brain ------

Brain.

Brain?
--- DR. JAFAR BERENSTEINER ---
There's trouble in his brain.
Anneurism, tumor, we don't know.
Catscan told us lots of fluid sits around the brain.
And so, we must operate to drain.
--- MIMI SCHWINN ---
Drain?
--- DR. JAFAR BERENSTEINER ---
Drain the brain.
Put a shunt inside his skull and tube into his stomach
where he'll pee the fluid out.
--- MIMI SCHWINN ---
Pee it out?
--- DR. JAFAR BERENSTEINER ---
And without a doubt, we'll make it so we can say
what's going on inside his brain
Why something is amiss.
