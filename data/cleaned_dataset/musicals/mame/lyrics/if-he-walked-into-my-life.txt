------ If He Walked Into My Life ------
--- Mame ---
Where is that boy with the bugle?
My little love was always my big romance;
Where's that boy with the bugle?
And why did I ever buy him those damn long pants?
Did he need a stronger hand?
Did he need a lighter touch?
Was I soft or was I tough?
Did I give enough?
Did I give too much?
At the moment when he needed me,
Did I ever turn away?
Would I be there when he called,
If he walked into my life today.
Were his days a little dull?
Were his nights a little wild?
Did I overstate my plan?
Did I stress the man?
And forget the child.
And there must have been a million things.
That my heart forgot to say.
Would I think of one or two,
If he walked into my life today.
Should I blame the times I pampered him,
Or blame the times I bossed him;
What a shame!
I never really found the boy,
Before I lost him.
Were the years a little fast?
Was his world a little free?
Was there too much of a crowd?
All too lush and loud and not enough for me.
Though I'll ask myself my whole life long,
What went wrong along the way;
Would I make the same mistakes
If he walked into my life today?
If that boy with the bugle,
If he walked into my life today.

Where is that girl with the promise?
The girl who tried to show me what love could be;
Where is that girl with the promise?
And why do I feel the someone to blame is me?
Did she need a stronger hand?
Did she need a lighter touch?
Was I soft or was I tough?
Did I give enough?
Did I give too much?
At the moment that she needed me,
Did I ever turn away?
Would I be there when she called,
If she walked into my life today.
Did she mind the lonely nights?
Did she count the empty days?
Was I silent, was I cold?
Was I quick to scold?
Was I slow to praise?
And there must have been a million things.
That my heart forgot to say.
Would I think of one or two,
If she walked into my life today.
Should I blame the times I pampered her,
Or blame the times I bossed her;
What a shame!
I never really found the girl,
Before I lost her.
Were the years a little fast?
Was her world a little free?
Was there too much of a crowd?
All too lush and loud and not enough for me.
Though I'll ask myself my whole life long,
What went wrong along the way;
Would I make the same mistakes
If she walked into my life today?
If that girl with the promise,
