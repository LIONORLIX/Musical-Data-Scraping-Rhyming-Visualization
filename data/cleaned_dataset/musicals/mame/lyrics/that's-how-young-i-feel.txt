------ That's How Young I Feel ------
--- Mame and All ---
I have the feeling that time has halted,
I'd like two straws and a choc'late malted,
'Cause that's how young I feel.
I feel like peckin' and bunny huggin'
And Lindy hoppin' and jitterbuggin'
'Cause that's how young I feel.
I'm mad for that big band beat,
Wanna ride in a rumble seat.
Love a faceful of frozen custard,
To have a hot dog with sand and mustard,
And ride the Ferris wheel,
Oh, honey,
'Cause that's how young I feel.
I'm ready to ask my mom,
Can I go to the Junior Prom.
Want a coonskin to knock about with,
To start each mornin' by givin' out
With a Rudy Vallee squeal,
Oh, honey,
'Cause that's how young I feel.
[Instrumental]
I find I'm faced with that old sensation,
Will life go on after graduation,
'Cause that's how young I feel.
I'd love to cheer at a football rally
And swap sorority pins with Sally,
'Cause that's how young I feel.
Love a faceful of frozen custard,
To have a hot dog with sand and mustard,
And ride the Ferris wheel,
Oh, honey,
'Cause that's how young I feel.
Young I feel
Young I feel
Young I feel
That's how young
