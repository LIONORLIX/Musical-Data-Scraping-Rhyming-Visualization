------ The Letter ------
--- Young Patrick ---
Dear Auntie Mame,
In English Lit
I'm in the top ten;
I got a B plus average again.
For me the South's the greatest of
All the crazy places that we've been,
Wait 'til you hear the latest
I think I've got a whisker
On my chin!
Older Patrick:
Dear Auntie Mame,
I find it's getting harder to cram
I flunked my Latin grammar exam.
I'm shaving every morning
And growing like it's going on a style
The dibs all seem to go for me
Give friends a big hello for me,
A hug to Uncle Beau for me.
