------ It's Today ------
--- Mame ---
Light the candles,
Get the ice out,
Roll the rug up,
It's today.
Though it may not be anyone's birthday,
And though it's far from the first of the year,
I know that this very minute has history in it, we're here!
All:
It's a time for making merry,
And so I'm for making hay.
Mame:
Tune the grand up,
Dance your shoes off,
Strike the band up,
It's today!
All:
And we're living
In the world game,
So this whole game's
What we make.
Mame:
Call the cops out,
Raise the rockets,
Pull the stops out,
All:
Pull out the stops,
It's today
Light the candles,
Fill the punch bowl,
Throw confetti,
It's today.
Girls:
Life can also be lived on a weekday,
So don't depend on a holiday date,
If you need New Year's to bubble,
Then order a double and wait.
Doo doo doo doo dah
All:
There's a thank you you can give life,
If you live life all the way.
Pull the stops out,
Hold the roof down,
Mame:
Fellows watch out,
It's today.
All:
It's a time for making merry,
And so I'm for making hay.
Tune the grand up,
Call the cops out,
Strike the band up,
Pull the stops out,
Hallelujah!
