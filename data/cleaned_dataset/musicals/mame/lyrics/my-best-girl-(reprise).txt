------ My Best Girl (Reprise) ------
--- Older Patrick ---
You're my best girl and nothing you do is wrong,
I'm proud you belong to me;
And if a day is rough for me,
Having you there's enough for me.
And if someday when everything turns out wrong,
You're through with the human race,
Come running to me,
For you'll always be
