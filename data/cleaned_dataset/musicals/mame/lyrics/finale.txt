--- Mame ---
Open a new window,
Open a new door,
Travel a new highway,
That's never been tried before;
--- Chorus ---
Dance to a new rhythm,
Whistle a new song,
Toast with a new vintage,
The fizz doesn't fizz too long.
There's only one way to make the bubbles stay,
Simply travel a new high way,
Dance to a new rhythm,
Open a new window ev'ry day!
--- Unknown ---
There's a "thank you" you can give life,
If you live life all the way.
Call the cops out,
Raise the rocket,
Pull the stops out,
It's today!
--- Unknown ---
Haul out the holly;
Put up the tree before my spirit falls again.
Fill up the stocking,
We may be rushing things,
But deck the halls again now.
For we need a little Christmas
Right this very minute,
Candles in the window,
Carols at the spinet.
Yes, we need a little Christmas
Right this very minute.
Need a little Christmas now!
--- Unknown ---
You coax the blues right out of the horn, Mame,
You charm the husk right off of the corn, Mame,
You came, you saw, you conquered
And absolutely nothing is the same.
You're special fascination'll prove to be inspirational,
We think you're just sensational, Mame.
