Beautiful child in razor heels
Sashays into the room
All the boys, they catch their breath
And the mirrors swoon
Now she's running down the hallway
Headscarf and a Hollywood smile
She's got a dagger in your back
And a killer style
Love and hate, it's all the same my way
Just another twisted game to play
Evil, child star, movie queen
Evil, sweet charm, Mabeline
Evil, no one gets the better of me
Your father's rage and a cocktail dress
With a bullet proof heart
Why is your life in such a mess
If you're so damn smart
Judy Garland, Jimmy Dean
You tragedy queen
Give me fat girls, give me rough boys
Give me what I dream
Love and hate, it's all the same my way
Just another twisted game to play
Evil, child star, movie queen
Evil, sweet charm, Mabeline
