------ Church of the Poison Mind ------
--- Unknown ---
Desolate loving in your eyes
You used an made my life so sweet
Step out like a God found child
I saw your eyes across the street
--- Unknown ---
Who would be the fool to take you
Be more than just kind
Step into a life of maybe
Love is hard to find
--- Chorus ---
In the church of the poison mind (x4)
--- Unknown ---
Watch me clingling to the beat
I had to fight to make it mine
That religion you could sink in neat
Just move your feet an youll feel fine
--- Unknown ---
Who would be the fool to maybe
Trick a kiss in time
Who am I to say thats crazy
Love will make you blind
--- Unknown ---
In the church of the poison mind (x3)
--- Unknown ---
Desolate loving in your eyes
You used an made my life so sweet
Step out like a God found child
I saw your eyes across the street
--- Unknown ---
Who would be the fool to take you
Be more than just kind
Step into a life of maybe
Love is hard to find
