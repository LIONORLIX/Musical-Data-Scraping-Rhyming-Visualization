------ Pretty Lies ------
--- KIM ---
I can never get this muck from round my eyes
Dunno why I bother sometimes
Painting my face up, for the kill
A little bit of glitter goes a long, long way
But if you never see my face
How will you know if you feel is real
I've been trying to be something, I'll never be
But I'm nothing special, there's no mystery
I've been hiding from the world, and from myself
Wanting love so desperately, oh so desperately
If you see all the hurt in my eyes
Will you laugh, will you run, will you carry me
If I tell you that I'm weak and I'm scared
Will that seem absurd
I'm the loneliest girl in the world
I can never let you see the girl inside
Won't let my defences slide
I can't let you see my tears
A little bit of fire drives the boys away
But maybe I might let you stay
If you show me that your love is real
I've been trying to be something, I'll never be
But I'm nothing special, there's no mystery
I've been hiding from the world, and from myself
Wanting love so desperately, oh so desperately
If you see all the hurt in my eyes
Will you laugh, will you run, will you carry me
If I tell you that I'm weak and I'm scared
Will that seem absurd
