------ Shelter ------
--- PETAL ---
See me on the street, just a vagabond
I'm a beggar, I'm a thief
But I'm some mother's son
You don't see the hunger
Or the good in me
Just a hand reaching to ya
Wanting something for free
Call me a taker, I've got nothing to give
Call me a loser, I'm just trying to live
With a bit more love, love, love
I could be someone
I could be someone
--- PETAL ---
Isn't that a shame. Boo. Now then... Count me in...
Call me a taker, I've got nothing to give Call me a loser,
I'm just trying to live
With a bit more love, love, love
I could be someone
I could be someone
--- PETAL ---
Did ya like that one? Did ya?
