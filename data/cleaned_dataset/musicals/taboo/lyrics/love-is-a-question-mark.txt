------ Love Is A Question Mark ------
--- BILLY AND KIM ---
--- KIM ---
Who can explain the attraction
I wouldn't know where to begin
Love can be faltered or founded
On the slightest thing
--- BILLY ---
I can't explain the attraction
I don't know where to start
Love's a peculiar feeling
It's a question mark
--- BOTH ---
But if you stick around
You might find me complicated
I'm difficult at times
But I'm worth it
Really worth it
Don't get too close
Don't be afraid
Don't say too much
If you don't mean it
I can be kind
I can be cold
I've got a heart
Haven't you seen it
--- KIM ---
I can't explain the attraction
You're nothing special to me
--- BILLY ---
You've got the kind of beauty
That the eye can't see
--- BOTH ---
But if you stick around
You might find me complicated
I'm difficult at times
But I'm worth it
Really worth it
Don't get too close
Don't be afraid
Don't say too much
If you don't mean it
I can be kind
I can be cold
I've got a heart
Haven't you seen it
Don't get too close
Don't be afraid
Don't say too much
If you don't mean it
I can be kind
I can be cold
I've got a heart
--- BILLY ---
Haven't you seen it...
