------ Talk Amongst Yourselves ------
--- JOSIE ---
Staring my life in the face
Haunted by what could have been
What should have been
What might have been
Was not
You're just a living disgrace
Drag on another cigarette
As you try to forget
You're tired of saving face
I live among these ruins
I've wasted so much breath
As dreams fade into nothing
There's no one there
There's nothing left
Talk amongst yourselves
But I know words won't make it better
You think you know me well
I know my faults down to the letter
Wiping these tears from my face
Wave goodbye to memories
You holding me, you loving me
You've changed
Take me away from this place
Far from all my bitterness
From promises broken everyday
I live among these ruins
I've wasted so much breath
As dreams fade into nothing
There's no one there
There's nothing left
Talk amongst yourselves
But I know words won't make it better
You think you know me well
I know my faults down to the letter
So talk amongst yourselvesBut I know words won't make it better
You think you know me well
I know my faults down to the letter
