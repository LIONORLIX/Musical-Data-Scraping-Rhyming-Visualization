------ I'll Have You All ------
--- LEIGH BOWERY ---
--- LEIGH ---
Mirror, mirror on the wall, who's the biggest freak of all?
--- LEIGH ---
I've had a man or two
In fact I've had a few
In dark and dingy places
I've fallen to my knees
And begged a stranger please
A world of lust and lipstick traces
I've had lawyers, doctors, judges and thugs
And I never, never, never ask their names
Hungry faces in the dark
Dirty deeds in the park
And before you ask
I feel no shame
Fat, thin, old, young, tiny meat, well hung
White, black, half-chat
Did you see the size of that
Rough, shy, Greek, Thai
Hairy, scary, straight or bi
I'll have them all
I'll have you all
--- Unknown ---
I never fall in love
I just can't get enough
Of boys with pretty faces
Warm bed or Russell Square
A cottage here or there
Those charming, old familiar places
I've had lawyers, doctors, judges and thugs
And I never, never, never ask their names
Hungry faces in the dark
Dirty deeds in the park
And before you ask
I feel no shame
--- LEIGH, BILLY AND PHILIP ---
Fat, thin, old, young, tiny meat, well hung
White, black, half-chat
Did you see the size of thatRough, shy, Greek, Thai
Hairy, scary, straight or bi
--- LEIGH ---
I'll have you all
I'll have you all
