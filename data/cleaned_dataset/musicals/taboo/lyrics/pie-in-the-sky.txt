------ Pie In The Sky ------
--- BOY GEORGE ---
Looking at life my friends
I feel confusion
A work in progress or just a mystery
Headless chickens
Sequins dripping
It was all
All about you and me
Now who do we think we are?
Sad old clowns
Two bright shining stars
There was method in our madness
There's a rumour in the truth
There was love
But where's the proof
Ooh, ooh
Looking at you my friend
Silent and watching
I see the humour and the tragedy
Hearts are ticking
Something's missing
It was all
All about you and me
Who do we thing we are?
Sad old clowns
Two bright shining stars
There was method in our madness
There's a rumour in the truth
There was love
But where's the proof
Ooh, ooh
Always together
Always alone
Frightened of silence
Glued to the phone
First you see me
Then you don't
Who's the victim
Where's the joke
Who do we thing we are?
Sad old clowns
Two bright shining stars
There was method in our madness
There's a rumour in the truth
There was love
But what's the use...?
