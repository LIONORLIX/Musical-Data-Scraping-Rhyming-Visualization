------ Safe in the City ------
--- BILLY ---
You think you know me
I don't even know me
I'd screw my head off
and lay it at your feet
So you can tell me please
What's on my mind
My curiosity
My sweet complexity
You crush my spirit and you kill my vanity
And I run, run, run, run
From what I feel inside
If I stay here
I'll be nothing
I'll be no-one
So don't hold me back
Just let me go
It's safe in the city
So safe in the city
If I stay here
I'll be nothing
I'll be no-one
So don't hold me back
Just let me go
It's safe in the city
So safe in the city
I don't wanna bite the hand that feeds me
Send me on a rocket to the moon
The city lights and traffic jams excite me
Maybe I've grown up much too soon
If I stay here
I'll be nothing
I'll be no-one
So don't hold me back
Just let me go
It's safe in the city
So safe in the city
It's safe in the city
So safe in the city

Give me a freak
Any day of the week
I'm comfortable with those you call demented
Give me a freak
Not someone meek
With space between their ears that can be rented
I like noise
Aggressive boys
Hookers, thieves and queers and those confused
If you knew
What I knew
You'd be a freak too

I'm known in all the wrong places
I'm one of those faces
You'll never forget
And those who may not adore me
Could never ignore me
I'm placing a bet
I can be real shallow if I try
But there's so much more to me than meets the eye
My manner can be misconstrued as trite
I'm irrepressible - a creature of the night
I'm known in all the wrong placesI'm one of those faces
You'll never forget
You'll never forget
You'll never forget!
