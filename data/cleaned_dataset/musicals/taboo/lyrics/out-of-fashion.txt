------ Out Of Fashion ------
--- STEVE STRANGE ---
Too much jealousy will make you crazy
I've been walking the streets in shoes that kill my feet
Too much make up, Oh, dream like a lady
Now you're a prisoner of some shallow dream
You're out of fashion
Your moment's over
And yes I loved you
Oh, but you wore me out
You're out of fashion
So just forget it now
A living tragedy
Parody, fits you like a glove
Too much ego makes you ugly, yeah
I've been running away from what I really need
Desperation pushes love away
Now you're a prisoner of your own desire
You're out of fashion
Your moment's over
And yes I loved you
Oh, but you wore me out
You're out of fashion
So just forget it now
A living tragedy
Parody fits you like a glove
There's enough love in this world for you and me
There's enough love for everyone, you wait and see
There's enough love in this world, so why do we hide
What we feel inside?
There's enough love in this world for you and me
There's enough love in for everyone, you wait and see
There's enough love in this world, so why do we hide
What we feel inside?
There's enough love in this world
There's enough love for everyone
There's enough love in this worldSo why do we hide what we feel inside
If there's enough love in this world
If there's enough love for everyone
If there's enough love in this world
Then why do we hide what we feel inside
There's enough love in this world
If there's enough love for everyone
If there's enough love in this world
Then why do we hide what we feel inside
If there's enough love for everyone
