--- GEORGE AND MARILYN ---
We know we're special
It won't be long
Before the universe catches on
--- GEORGE ---
You've got the figure
--- MARILYN ---
You've got the voice
--- BOTH ---
Face it sister we're spoilt for choice
I can see the stars from the gutter
And if it all goes wrong
We've got each other
Don't despair fame is due
I can see a legend in you
--- MARILYN ---
Yeah me too
We know we're gifted
--- GEORGE ---
Yeah gift of the gab

--- BOTH ---
I can see the stars from the gutter
And if it all goes wrong
We've got each other
Don't despair fame is due
I can see a legend in you
--- GEORGE ---
Yeah me too
--- MARILYN ---
I want my name in lights
--- GEORGE ---
I want my own skyscraper
--- MARILYN ---
I wanna be a billionaire
--- GEORGE ---
And not just on paper
--- MARILYN ---

--- BOTH ---

And if it all goes wrong

I can see a future in you
