------ Ich Bin Kunst ------
--- LEIGH BOWERY ---
Ich Bin Kunst, can't you see
Look at you, then look at me
I am art, you're parody
Ich Bin Kunst
Je suis art, tres, tres debonair,
Because you don't, because I dare
I blow you mind, C'est mon plaisir
Ich Bin Kunst
It started when I was only a boy
I couldn't kick a ball, climb a tree, play at war
I took pleasure in the things that make men shudder
I dressed up in the wardrobe of my Mother
My father said Don't panic it's a phase
Phase one I said, and snipped and sewed for days
I dreamed of London town, Ardent fashion was my thing,
I arrived and took a job in Burger King! - It was nothing!
Ich Bin Kunst, can't you see,
Look at you, then look at me, I am art, you're parody
Ich Bin Kunst
Je suis art, tres, tres, debonair,
Because you don't, and because I dare,
I blow you mind, C'est mon plaisir
