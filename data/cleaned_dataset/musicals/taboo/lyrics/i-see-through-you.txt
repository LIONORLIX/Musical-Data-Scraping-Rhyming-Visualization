------ I See Through You ------
--- BILLY ---
There was a time when I believed
That you had power over me
I woke up and the fear was gone
I found the strength to carry on
You twisted my reality and all my possibilities
Now look at you all broke in two
And I'll be moving on
My life out of your hands
Don't need a reason why
Don't have to understand
'Cause it's sweet goodbye
I see through you
And all the tears I cried
I see through you
No, you're not God on high
So goodbye
There was a time when I believed
That you could change the world for me
I woke up and the pain was gone
I found the strength to carry on
You twisted my reality and all my possibilities
Now look at you all broke in two
And I'll be moving on
My life out of your hands
Don't need a reason why
Don't have to understand
'Cause it's sweet goodbye
I see through you
And all the tears I cried
I see through you
No, you're not God on high
I see through you
I see through you
Smoked you like a cigarette
I'll get you out for good
I never thought I could
I see through you
I see through you
