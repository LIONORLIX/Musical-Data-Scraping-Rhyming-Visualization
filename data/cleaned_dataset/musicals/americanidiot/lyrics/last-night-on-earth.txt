------ Last Night on Earth ------
--- ST. JIMMY ---
I text a postcard, sent to you
Did it go through?
Sending all my love to you
You are the moonlight of my life every night
Giving all my love to you
--- WHATSERNAME ---
My beating heart belongs to you
I walked for miles 'til I found you
--- ST. JIMMY and WHATSERNAME ---
I'm here to honor you
If I lose everything in the fire
I'm sending all my love to you
--- HEATHER ---
With every breath that I am worth
Here on Earth
I'm sending all my love to you
So if you dare to second guess
You can rest
Assured that all my love's for you
My beating heart belongs to you
--- ST. JIMMY and WHATSERNAME ---
I walked for miles 'til I found you
--- ST. JIMMY, HEATHER, and WHATSERNAME ---
I'm here to honor you
If I lose everything in the fire
I'm sending all my love to you
--- HEATHER ---
My beating heart belongs to you
--- ST. JIMMY ---
I walked for miles 'til I found you
--- Unknown ---
ST. JIMMY and HEATHER
I'm here to honor you
If I lose everything in the fire
