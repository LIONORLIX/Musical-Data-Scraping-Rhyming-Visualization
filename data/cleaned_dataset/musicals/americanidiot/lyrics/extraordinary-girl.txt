------ Extraordinary Girl ------
--- TUNNY ---
She's an extraordinary girl
In an ordinary world
And she can't seem to get away
--- EXTRAORDINARY GIRL ---
He locks the courage in his mind
Like a child left behind
Like a pet left in the rain
--- TUNNY ---
She's all alone again
Wiping the tears from her eyes
--- EXTRAORDINARY GIRL ---
Some days he feels like dying
--- TUNNY ---
She gets so sikc of crying
--- TUNNY and BEN ---
She sees the mirror of herself
An image she wants to sell
To anyone willing to buy
--- EXTRAORDINARY GIRL and LIBBY ---
He steals the image in her kiss
From her heart's apocalypse
From the one called Whatsername
--- TUNNY ---
She's all alone again
Wiping the tears from her eyes
--- EXTRAORDINARY GIRL ---
Some days he feels like dying
--- TUNNY ---
She gets so sick of crying
--- TUNNY and EXTRAORDINARY GIRL ---
She's all alone again
Wiping the tears from her eyes
Some days he feels like dying
Some days it's not worth trying
Now that they both are finding
--- TUNNY ---
She gets so sick of crying.
--- ALL ---
She'as an extraordinary girl
An extraordinary girl
An extraordinary girl
