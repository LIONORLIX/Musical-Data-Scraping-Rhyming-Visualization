------ Give Me Novacaine ------
--- WILL ---
Take away the sensation inside
Bitter sweet migraine in my head
It;s like a throbbing toothache of the mind
I can't take this feeling anymore
Drain the pressure from the swelling
This sensation's overwhelming
Give me a long kiss goodnight
And everything will be alright
Tell me that I won't feel a thing
So give me novacaine
--- Unknown ---
Out of body and out of mind
Kiss the demons out of my dreams
I get the funny feeling and that’s alright
Johnny says its better than here,
I’ll tell you what
Drain the pressure from the swelling
This sensation's overwhelming
Give me a long kiss goodnight
And everything will be alright
Tell me that I won't feel a thing,
So give me novacaine
--- ALL ---
Aaah, novacaine
--- TUNNY and WILL ---
Drain the pressure from the swelling
This sensation's overwhelming
Give me a long kiss goodnight
And everything will be alright
Tell me thatI won't feel a thing
