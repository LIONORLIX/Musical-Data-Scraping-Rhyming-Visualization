------ Are We the Waiting ------
--- TUNNY ---
Starry nights
City lights coming down over me
Skyscrapers and stargazers in my head
Are we, we are
Are we, we are the waiting unknown
This dirty town was burning down
in my dreams
Lost and found, city bound in my dreams
And screaming
--- ALL ---
Are we, we are
Are we, we are the waiting
--- Unknown ---
TUNNY and JOSHUA
And screaming
--- ALL ---
Are we, we are
Are we, we are the waiting
--- TUNNY ---
Forget-me-nots and second thoughts
Live in isolation
Heads or tails and fairytales in my mind
Are we, we are
Are we, we are the waiting unknown
The rage and love
The story of my life
The Jesus of Suburbia is a lie
--- TUNNY and JOSHUA ---
And screaming
--- ALL ---
Are we, we are
Are we, we are the waiting
--- TUNNY ---
The waiting unknown
--- ALL ---
Are we, we are
Are we, we are the waiting
--- TUNNY and JOSHUA ---
And screaming
--- ALL ---
Are we, we are
Are we, we are the waiting
--- TUNNY ---
The waiting unknown
--- ALL ---
Are we, we are
Are we, we are the waiting
--- TUNNY ---
The waiting unknown
--- ALL ---
The waiting
The waiting
