------ Jesus of Suburbia ------
--- JOHNNY ---
I'm the son of rage and love
The Jesus of Suburbia
(From) the bible of none of the above
On a steady diet of
Soda pop and Ritalin
No one ever died for my sins in hell
As far as I can tell
At least the ones I got away with
But there's nothing wrong with me
This is how I'm supposed to be
In a land of make-believe
That don't believe in me
--- WILL ---
Get my television fix
--- JOHNNY ---
Sitting on my crucifix
--- WILL ---
The living room in my private womb
--- JOHNNY ---
While the moms and Brads are away
--- WILL ---
To fall in love
--- JOHNNY ---
And fall in debt
To alcohol
--- WILL ---
And cigarettes
--- JOHNNY ---
And Mary Jane
--- WILL ---
To keep me insane
--- JOHNNY ---
Doing someone else's cocaine
--- BOTH ---
And there's nothing wrong with me
This is how I'm supposed to be
In a land of make-believe
That don't believe in me
--- Unknown ---
II. City of the Damned
--- TUNNY ---
At the center of the earth
in the parking lot
Of the 7-11 where I was taught
The motto was just a lie
It says: Home is Where Your Heart Is
But what a shame
'Cause everyone's heart doesn't beat the same.
We're beating out of time
--- TUNNY, JOHNNY, AND WILL ---
City of the dead
--- TUNNY ---
At the end of another lost highway
Signs misleading to nowhere
--- TUNNY, JOHNNY, AND WILL ---
City of the damned
--- TUNNY ---
Lost children with dirty faces today
No one really seems to care
I read the graffiti in the athroom stall
--- JOHNNY ---
Like the holy scriptures in a shopping mall
--- TUNNY ---
And so it seemed to confess
--- WILL ---
It didn't say much, but it only confirmed
--- TUNNY ---
That the center of the earth
Is the end of the world
--- TUNNY, JOHNNY, AND WILL ---
And I could really care less
City of the dead
--- TUNNY ---
At the end of another lost highway
Signs misleading to nowhere
--- TUNNY, JOHNNY, AND WILL ---
City of the damned.
--- TUNNY ---
Lost children with dirty faces today
No one really seems to care
--- Unknown ---
III. I Don't Care
--- JOHNNY ---
I don't care if you don't
--- WILL ---
I don't care if you don't
--- TUNNY ---
I don't care if you don't care
--- ALL ---
I don't care if you don't
I don't care if you don't
I don't care if you don't care, etc.
--- JOHNNY ---
Everyone is so full of shit
Born and raised by hypocrites
--- WILL ---
Hearts recycled but never saved
From the cradle to the grave
--- TUNNY ---
We are the kids of war and peace
From Anaheim to the Middle East
--- TUNNY and WILL ---
We are the stories and disciples of
--- ALL ---
The Jesus of Suburbia
Land of make-believe
And it don't believe in me
Land of make-believe and I don't believe
--- Unknown ---
JOHNNY, WILL, and TUNNY
And I don't care!
I don't care
I don't care
I don't care
I don't care
I don't care
--- Unknown ---
IV. Dearly Beloved
--- HEATHER ---
Dearly beloved, are you listening?
I can't rememer a word that you were saying
Are we demented? Or am I disturbed?
The space that's in-between insane and insecure
--- Unknown ---
Oh therapy, can you please fill the void?
Am I retarded or am I just overjoyed?
Nobody's perfect and I stand accused
For lack of a better word, and that's my best excuse
--- Unknown ---
V. Tales of Another Broken Home
--- JOHNNY ---
To live and not to breathe
--- JOHNNY, TUNNY, and WILL ---
Is to die in tragedy
--- JOHNNY ---
To run, to run away
--- JOHNNY, TUNNY, and WILL ---
To find what you believe
And I leave behind
This hurricane of f***ing lies
--- JOHNNY ---
I lost my faith to this
--- JOHNNY, TUNNY, and WILL ---
This town that don't exist
--- JOHNNY ---
So I run
I run away
--- JOHNNY, TUNNY, and WILL ---
To find what I believe
And I leave behind
This hurricane of f***ing lies
And I walked this line
A million and one f***ing times
But not this time
--- HEATHER ---
I don't feel any shame
I won't apologize
When there ain't nowhere you can go
--- ALL ---
Running away from pain
When you've been victimized
Tales from another broken home
--- WILL ---
You're leaving
You're leaving
