------ American Idiot ------
--- Unknown ---
Don't want to be an American Idiot
Don't want a nation under the new media
Hey, can you hear the sound of hysteria?
The subliminal mind f*** America
--- Unknown ---
Welcome to a new kind of tension
All across the alienation
Where everything isn't meant to be O.K.
--- Unknown ---
Television dreams of tomorrow
We're not the ones meant to follow
For that's enough to argue
--- Unknown ---
Maybe I'm the f***** America
I'm not a part of a redneck agenda
Now everybody, do the propaganda!
And sing along to the age of paranoia
--- Unknown ---
Welcome to a new kind of tension
All across the alienation
Where everything isn't meant to be O.K.
Television dreams of tomorrow
We're not the ones meant to follow
For that's enough to argue
--- Unknown ---
Don't want to be an American idiot
One nation controlled by the media
Information age of hysteria
Calling out to idiot America
--- Unknown ---
Welcome to a new kind of tension
All across the alienation
Where everything isn't meant to be O.K.
Television dreams of tomorrow
We're not the ones meant to follow
