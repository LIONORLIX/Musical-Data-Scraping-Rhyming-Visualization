------ Whatsername ------
--- Unknown ---
Thought I ran into you down on the street
Then it turned out to only be a dream
I made a point
To burn all of the photographs
She went away
and then I took a different path
I remember the face
But I can't recall the name
Now I wonder how Whatshername has been
--- Unknown ---
Seems that she disappeared without a trace
Did she ever marry old what's his face
I made a point to burn all of the photographs
She went away
and then I took a different path
I remember the face but I can't recall the name
Now I wonder how whatshername has been...
--- ALL ---
Remember, whatever
It seems like forever ago
Remember, whatever
It seems like forever ago
--- JOHNNY ---
The regrets are useless, in my mind
She's in my head, I must confess
The regrets are useless, in my mind,
She's in my head from so long ago
--- ALL ---
Go! Go! Go!
--- JOHNNY and ALL ---
And in the darkest night
If my memory serves me right
I'll never turn back time
--- JOHNNY ---
