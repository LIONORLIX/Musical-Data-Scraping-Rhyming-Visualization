------ Wake Me Up When September Ends ------
--- JOHNNY ---
Summer has come and passed
The innocent can never last
Wake me up when September ends
Like my father's come to pass
Seven years has gone so fast
Wake me up when September ends
--- WILL ---
Here comes the rain again
Falling from the stars
--- TUNNY ---
Drenched in my pain again
Becoming who we are
--- JOHNNY ---
As my memory rests
--- TUNNY ---
But never forgets
--- TUNNY and WILL ---
What I lost
--- JOHNNY, TUNNY, and WILL ---
Wake me up when September ends
Summer has come and passed
The innocent can never last
Wake me up when September ends.
--- TUNNY ---
Ring out the bells again
--- TUNNY and JOHNNY ---
Like we did when spring began
--- JOHNNY, TUNNY, and WILL ---
Wake me up when September ends
Here comes teh rain again
Falling from the stars
Drenched in my pain again
Becoming who we are
--- TUNNY ---
As my memory rests
--- JOHNNY, TUNNY, and WILL ---
But never forgets what I lost
Wake me up when Spetmber ends
--- TUNNY ---
Summer has come and passed
--- WILL ---
The innocent can never last
--- JOHNNY, TUNNY, and WILL ---
Wake me up when September ends
--- JOHNNY ---
Like my father's come to pass
--- JOHNNY, TUNNY, and WILL ---
Twenty years has gone so fast
Wake me up when Spetmber ends
Wake me up when Spetmber ends
Wake me up when Spetmber ends
--- ALL ---
