------ Too Much Too Soon ------
--- THEO ---
She's always living like she's running out of time
Too much just ain't enough to keep her satisfied
Her plastic card is filled with nothing comes to mind
It's now her occupation that she's overqualified
--- THEO and WILL ---
The looks are always so deceiving
The truth is always misconstrued
To you...
--- THEO ---
Too much too soon
Too little and now your coming unglued
Too much too soon
Too late and now it sucks to be you
--- ALYSHA ---
He's talking shit about how it's better way back when
He lives every waking moment as means to an end
We are we are but I'm not, I never used to be
So god bless your fucking past and to hell with your glory
--- ALYSHA and HEATHER ---
The looks are always so deceiving
--- ALYSHA ---
The truth is always misconstrued
--- ALL FOUR ---
To you
--- ALYSHA ---
Too much too soon
Too little and now you're coming unglued
Too much too soon
Too late and now it sucks to be you
--- ALL FOUR ---
Too!
--- THEO ---
She packs her bags and says goodbye
--- ALYSHA ---
And bon voyage
--- THEO ---
Farewell we'll see you in hell I hope you rest in pieces
--- ALL FOUR ---
F*** you
--- THEO and ALYSHA ---
Too much too soon
Too little and now your coming unglued
--- ALL FOUR ---
Too much too soon
--- THEO and ALYSHA ---
Too late and now it sucks to be you
--- ALL FOUR ---
Too!
--- ALYSHA ---
Woah oh oh oh...
