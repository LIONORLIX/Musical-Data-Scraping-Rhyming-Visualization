Do you know the enemy?

Well, gotta know teh enemy, wa-hey!

Oh-way, oh-way

The insurgency will rise
When the blood's been sacrifice
Don't be blinded by the lise
In your eyes
--- Unknown ---
Silence is the enemy
Against your urgency
So rally up the demons of your soul
--- ALL ---
Oh-way, oh-way
--- ST. JIMMY and ALL ---
Overthrow the effigies
The vast majority
While burning down the foreman of control
--- ALL ---
Oh-way, oh-way
--- WILL ---
And there's nothing wrong with me
This is how I'm supposed to be
In a land of bake-believe
That don't believe in me
--- ST. JIMMY ---
Wah!

Violence is an energy
Against the enemy well
Violence is an energy, wa-hey!

This is how I'm supposed to be

That don't believe in me

Silence is the enemy
