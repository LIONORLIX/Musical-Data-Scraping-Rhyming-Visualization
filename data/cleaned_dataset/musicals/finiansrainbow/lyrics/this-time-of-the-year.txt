------ This Time Of The Year ------

Hear ye, hear ye.
We can't be bothered
with the mortgage man...
--- Unknown ---
This time of the year!
--- Unknown ---
You'll be sorry interfering
with the law.
For spring don’t care
About the mortgage man
--- Unknown ---
This time of the year
--- Unknown ---
I'm giving you your last chance
to get back your land.
The dandelions in the dusky dell
Don’t give a hoot in hell
--- Unknown ---
- They're gonna smell without collateral
- This time of the year
- This time
- This time of the year
- Sweet merry buds and elderberry buds
- Don’t give a good ding-ding-dang
--- Unknown ---
Corn’s shooting up
Fruit trees a-fruitin’ up
Go tell Rawkins to go hang-hang
Don’t mess around here
--- Unknown ---
This time of the year
--- Unknown ---
You'll get it in the rear
--- Unknown ---
This time of the year

Magnolia’s are sentimental
Persimmons are queer
Keep your distance, now.
Give way, there.
You hear me? I said, keep your distance.
Don’t easily skeer
They sprout without real-estaters
--- Unknown ---
This time of the year
--- Unknown ---
That choo-choo’s comin'
And it's mighty clear
Woo, woo, Woody's here
He's up there ridin’ with the engineer
--- Unknown ---
Yes, Woody's here
--- Unknown ---
Just look at that choo-choo puffin’
Let's give it a mighty cheer
Just look at that engine huffin'
Dang blast it all, Woody's here
--- Unknown ---
Woody's here!
--- Unknown ---
Get a load of that whistle blowin'
That whistle is good to hear
It's wantin’ you to be knowin'
Dang blast it all, Woody's here
--- Unknown ---
Woody's here!
