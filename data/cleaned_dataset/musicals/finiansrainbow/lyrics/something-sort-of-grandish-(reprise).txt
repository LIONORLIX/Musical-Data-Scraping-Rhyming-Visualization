------ Something Sort Of Grandish (Reprise) ------
--- OG ---
Children,
if you help me find the little gold crock you can have anything that's made in fairyland.
--- Unknown ---
There'll be things plenty for allish
Wondrish toys and magic tricks
Electrish trains and basket ballish
Mintish drops and licorice stick.
--- Unknown ---
Life will be keenish all halloweenish
And jelly beanish too,
With ice-cream, and cakish
And soda to sup.
And no bellyacheish
To wakeish you up.
--- Unknown ---
There will be such delicious dishes
And will end to this daffyish plot.
We will go from wretch to riches.
When we'll find that goldish pot.
--- Unknown ---
There will be chocolate castish
with hot-dogs, and mustish
but cheers! ev'rybodysh
