------ When The Idle Poor Become The Idle Rich ------
--- SHARON ---
When de idle poor
Become the idle rich
You'll never know
just who is who
or who is which
Won't it be rich
When everyone's poor relative
Becomes a Rockefellative,
and pans no longer itch
What a switch!
--- FEMALE ENSEMBLE ---
When we all have Ermine
And have plastic teeth
How will we determine
Who's who underneath?
--- MALE ENSEMBLE ---
And when all your neighbours
are upper class
- You won't know your 'georges'
from your 'astors'.
--- SHARON ---
Let's toast the day
The day we drink that drinkie up
But with a little pinkie up.
--- COMPANY ---
The day on which
The idle poor
Become the idle rich
--- SHARON ---
When a rich man doesn't want to work
He's a bon vivant.
--- COMPANY ---
Yes, he's a bom vivant.
--- SHARON ---
But when a poor man doesn't want to work,
He's a laughter, he's a lounger
he's a lazier good for nothing
--- COMPANY ---
He's a jerk!
--- SHARON ---
When a rich man looses on a horse
Oh, isn't he the sport!
--- COMPANY ---
Oh, isn't he the sport!
--- SHARON ---
When a poor man looses on a horse
He's a gambler, he's a spender
He's a low life, he's a reason for divorce!
--- Unknown ---
When a rich man chases after dames
He's a man about town,
A man about town.
But when a poor man chases after dames
He's a bounder, he's a rounder
He's a rotter, and a lot of dirty names!
--- COMPANY ---
You'll never know
just who is which.
When de idle poor
Become the idle rich.
--- SHARON ---
When de idle poor
Become the idle rich
--- COMPANY ---
When de idle poor
Become the idle rich
You'll never know
just who is who
or who is which.
--- SHARON ---
No one will see
The Irish or the Slav in you
'cause when you're on Park Avenue
Cornelius and Mike
Look alike
--- FEMALE ENSEMBLE ---
When poor tweedle Doe
This rich tweedle Dee
--- COMPANY ---
This discrimination will no longer be.
--- MALE ENSEMBLE ---
When we leave undone
and out of the nuts
--- SHARON ---
You won't know your banker.
from your but...ler.
Let's make the switch.
With just a few annuities
We'll hide those incongruities
With clothes from Abercrombie Fitch
--- FEMALE ENSEMBLE I ---
Wheeeeeeeeeen de idle poor
--- FEMALE ENSEMBLE II ---
Wheeeeeeen become the
--- MALE ENSEMBLE ---
Wheeeeeeeen idle rich
--- COMPANY ---
When de idle poor
Become the idle rich
