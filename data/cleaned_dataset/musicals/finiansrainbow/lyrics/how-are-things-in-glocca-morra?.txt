------ How Are Things In Glocca Morra? ------
--- Unknown ---
I hear a bird
A Glocca Morra bird
It well may be he's bringin’ me
A cheerin’ word
I hear a breeze
A River Shannon breeze
It well may be
It's followed me across the seas
Then tell me please
How are things in Glocca Morra?
Is that little brook still leaping there?
Does it still run down to Donny cove?
Through Killybegs, Kilkerry and Kildare?
How are things in Glocca Morra?
Is that willow tree still weeping there?
Does that laddie (lassie) with the twinklin' eye
Come whistlin' (smilin') by
And does he (she) walk away,
Sad and dreamy there not to see me there?
So I ask each weepin' willow
And each brook along the way,
And each lad (lass) that comes a-whistlin' (a-sighin')
Tooralay
How are things in Glocca Morra
