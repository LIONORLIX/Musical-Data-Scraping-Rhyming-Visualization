------ Moments to Remember ------
--- Unknown ---
Jinx: January, to December
We'll have moments to remember'
All: Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh; ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
The New Year's Eve we did the town
The day we tore the goal-post down:
We will have these moments to remember
The quiet walks, the noisy fun,
The ballroom prize we almost won:
We will have these moments to remember
Though summer turns to winter,
And the present disappears,
The laughter we were glad to share will echo through the years
When other nights and other days may find us gone our separate ways
We will have these moments to remember
Frankie: The drive-in movie, where we'd go,{ooh-ooh-ohh,ooh-ooh-ooh'}
And somehow never watch the show
All: We will have these moments to remember
Smudge: To see you here, we are deeply glad,{ooh-ooh-ohh,ooh-ooh-ooh'}
Deeply grateful, and deeply Plaid
All: We will have these moments to remember
Though summer turns to winter,
And the present disappears,
The laughter we were glad to share will echo through the years
Through the years!
When other nights and other days may find us gone our separate ways
We will have these moments to remember
We will have these moments to remember!
