Now the time has come honey
won't you please be my wife
I will take good care of you
the rest of your life
I'm gonna spend a lot of money
House built for two
A cottage in the country
For just me and you

After we are married
We will raise a family
All the plans we had before
Will fit to a tee
When we live in humble
In our own little way
If we're to be so fortunate
Could this be the day

Crazy bout you baby, crazy bout you baby
Crazy bout you baby want you all to myself
Crazy, yes I'm crazy
