(spoken): Okay... Let's see.
Yes!
--- Unknown ---
(sung):Heart and soul, I fell in love with you
Lost control, just like a fool would do,
gladly
Because you held me tight
And stole a kiss in the night
--- Unknown ---
Heart and soul, I begged to be adored
Lost control, and tumbled overboard,
gladly
That magic night we kissed
There in the moon mist
--- Unknown ---
Oh! but your lips were thrilling, much too thrilling
Never before were mine so strangely willing
--- Unknown ---
But now I see, what one embrace can do
Look at me, you've got me loving you
madly
That little kiss you stole
Held all my heart and soul
--- Unknown ---
gladly
Because you held me tight
And stole a kiss in the night
--- Unknown ---
gladly
That magic night we kissed
There in the moon mist
--- Unknown ---
Oh! but your lips were thrilling, much too thrilling
Never before were mine so strangely willing
--- Unknown ---
But now I see, what one embrace can do
Look at me, you've got me loving you
madly
That little kiss you stole
Held all my heart and
Madly
that little kiss you stole
Held all my heart and soul
