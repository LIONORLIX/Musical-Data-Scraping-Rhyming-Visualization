------ Peggy Hewitt and Mystery del Gior ------
--- ALL ---
One thing I can say about Peggy Hewitt
She was incredibly loved
And she knew it
--- MAN TWO ---
She was in a children's show
And we were sitting with her girlfriend
The late, great Mysty Del Giorno
Who looked like one of the Borgias
She looked like one of the Borgias
--- Unknown ---
And when Peggy came on stage
Mysty stood up in this sea of children and yelled:
Is my girl gorgeous?
Is my girl gorgeous?
--- ALL ---
Look at the joy
Look at the joy on her face as she emotes
Maybe
She doesn't hit all the notes
But look at the joy
Look at the joy on her face
She is in a place of light
She is in a place of light
She is in a place of light
She is in a place of light
--- MAN ONE ---
One thing I can say about Peggy Hewitt
She was incredibly loved
And she knew it
--- ALL ---
Look at the joy
Look at the joy on her face
She is in a place of light
She is in a place of light
Look at the joy
Look at the joy on her face
She is in a place of light
