------ Infinite Joy ------
--- Unknown ---
Goodness is rewarded
Hope is guaranteed
Laughter builds strong bones
Right will intercede
Things you've said I often find I need
Indeed
--- Unknown ---
I see the world through your eyes
What's black and white is colorized
The knowledge you most dearly prized
I'm eager to employ
You said that life has infinite joy
--- Unknown ---
Your heart
Your glee
Haunt me
Your words strike suddenly
They're obvious but wise
--- Unknown ---
I see the world through your eyes
And possibilities expand
The one thing I don't understand
Is how you kept your poise
When life has infinite joys
Life has infinite joys
Infinite joys
--- Unknown ---
Your face
Your voice
Rejoice
To have you back with me
Is such a fine surprise
--- Unknown ---
I see the world through your eyes
I taste lemon on my lips
I marvel at the sailing ships
Of well-dressed girls and boys
And life--
Life has infinite joys
Has infinite joys
