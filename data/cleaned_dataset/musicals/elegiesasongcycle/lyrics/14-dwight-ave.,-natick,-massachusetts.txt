--- BARBARA FINN ---
I lived at 14 Dwight Ave
Natick, Massachusetts
In a small house on a sloping hill
And the friends I had then
I knew I'd have forever
And the fact is I have them still, I do, I always will
--- Unknown ---
We were raising our children together
Side by side
Life was sweet
Oh, lucky us
For living on that street
--- I love them ---
Charlotte, Sophie, Shirley, Norma, Rue
I love them
Here's why I do:
We made each others' lives feel more complete
A great suburban commune on our tiny street
--- Unknown ---
We lived at 14 Dwight Ave
Natick, splendid Massachusetts
Trees grew taller the more we stayed
As the kids grew, some husbands
Died in Massachusetts
But the women were strong and unafraid and rarely prayed
--- Unknown ---
We were raising our children together
Hopeful arms
Dancing feet
Oh, lucky us
We're living on that street
--- Unknown ---
Things happen
People die despite their age and wealth
Things happen
We die ourselves
My youngest son: the sweetest man alive
Is taking me-I know he knows-for one last ride
At my request
To see the sights
That we love best
To hit the high spot, the pinnacle, the crest
Of everywhere we've been
--- Unknown ---
So with Michael and my oxygen in tow
Let's go,
Says Barbara Finn
Let's go
Let's go!
--- MICHAEL FINN ---
We went to Wilson Junior High
We each once said goodbye
Then we moved on
We went to Natick's field of dreams
Where dad coached summer teams
And won
Some places we had planned on seeing
Already were gone
--- BARBARA ---
We hit the Dairy Queen for Michael
Where he used to cycle
Then moved on
Then moved on
--- Unknown ---
Where Nancy put a ring on her ring finger
--- Unknown ---
We talked of having fun
--- Unknown ---
We traced where he delivered papers every day at dawn
We hit the high spots and the low
--- Unknown ---
Then moved on
Then moved on	[MICHAEL]
--- Unknown ---
Then moved on
Then moved on
The stages Billy used to sing on
--- Unknown ---
We hit the roads
You used to run
--- Unknown ---
We cried
We traced where I delivered papers every day at dawn
--- Unknown ---
We motored to and fro
Then moved on
Then moved on
[MICHAEL]
We stopped by houses of some people
We had barely known
--- BARBARA ---
And then
Before I'm too exhausted
I said
Michael, take me home
Michael
Take me-
--- Unknown ---
To 14 Dwight Ave
Natick, Massachusetts
And the memories come hard as wood
There's Charlotte
My dear, dear Charlotte making [?]
For the whole disbelieving neighborhood
It's so damn good
--- Unknown ---
Sophie's smiling
And Shirley is laughing
Norma's blunt, but never ever shrill
And I'm so
Damn lucky to have lived here
It's a crime we've
So little time to kill
But I'm blessed
By people who have lived here
And I see them still
--- Unknown ---
They lived at 14 Dwight Ave
Natick, Massachusetts
In a small house on a sloping
Hill
