------ Anytime (I Am There) ------
--- Unknown ---
Any time you laugh
Any time you cry
Any time you hear a sound
When you`re on the grass
Lying on the ground
Any time you wash your hands
I`ll be around
--- Unknown ---
I`ll be there on the baseball field
Though I`m well concealed
I`ll be out there cheering
I`ll be there in the books you read
It is guaranteed
I`m not disappearing fast
Any time
No not any time
--- Unknown ---
And I am there each morning
I am there each fall
I am present without warning
And I`m watching it all
Yes I`m watching it all
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
And I am there in music
I am there in sky
I don`t why this thing did happen
But this much is clear
Any time or anywhere
I am there
--- Unknown ---
Any time you pray
Any time you fight
Any time you`ve gained a pound
Any time it`s day
Any time it`s night
Any time the earth moves
I`ll be around
--- Unknown ---
I`ll be there in the maple trees
I`m a summer breeze
On a perfect evening
I`ll be there when you celebrate
When the world seems great
I`ll be waiting by your side
Any time
Yes! Any time
--- Unknown ---
And I am there each morning
I am there each fall
I present without warning
And I`m watching it all
Yes I`m watching it all
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
--- Unknown ---
And I am there in flowers
I am there in snow
I don`t know why this thing happened
But this much is clear
Any time you cry
Any time you sing
For anything
I`ll be there
Each morning
I`ll be there each fall
I don`t why this thing happened
But this much is clear
--- Unknown ---
Be aware
I am there
I am there
I am there
I am there
--- Unknown ---
I am there
I am there
I am there
