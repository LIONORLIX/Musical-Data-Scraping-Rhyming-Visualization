------ When the Earth Stopped Turning ------
--- Unknown ---
I remember what you said
I remember every word
I remember how the earth stopped turning
We were sitting on the bed
And the clock was ticking louder
There's the overwhelming smell of powder in the air
Everything is skewed
Everything is blurred
I remember every word
--- Unknown ---
I remember how we roared
Laughed so hard we almost cried
Laughed so long I felt the earth stop turning
We were never ever bored
And you made us feel amazing
We were blazing through our lives like comets through the sky
Now that you're not here
Everything's awry
--- Unknown ---
The world is good you said
Enjoy its highs you said
The summer flies you said
So make a parade
Of every moment
Now throw away your hate
And focus on what's great instead
I'm dying so there's no time for debate
You said
--- Unknown ---
I remember how you smiled
You were trying not to smile
Then you smiled and the earth stopped turning
All the images are filed
All the images keep flicking
Also all of us are slow at picking up our cues
Nothing left to win
Nothing more to lose
--- Unknown ---
The earth is good she said
Enjoy its shit she said
'Cus this is it she said
So make a parade
Of every moment
Now pull up to the curb
The sign Do not disturb's ahead
The truth is that you made my life superb
She said
--- Unknown ---
On a Sunday night in May
In a very quiet way
I remember how the earth stopped turning
Turning
Turning
Turning!
