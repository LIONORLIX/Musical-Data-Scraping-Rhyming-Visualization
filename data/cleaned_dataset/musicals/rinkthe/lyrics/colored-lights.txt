------ Colored Lights ------
--- Unknown ---
I was sitting on a sand dune in santa cruz
Or monterrey.
Well, anyway,
I could feel the trickle on my cheek of ocean spray.
A perfect day.
Well, anyway.
I remember that i turned to sam and said,
Or was it fred?
Well, anyway.
I should be up and yet i`m down instead.
Something`s missing, sam;
Something`s missing fred.
Something`s missing here.
Where are my colored lights?
Beats and bleachers and colored lights
Passing smiles, `round and `round
Thumping oom-pah-pah organ sound.
Noisy boys, long and lean.
Giggles of girls in the mezzanine.
Filtered through colored lights,
Gold and amber and green.
I was sailing out of long beach on a catamaran
Or fishing scow.
Well, anyhow.
I was leaning, chewing cashews off the starboard bow.
That sunset: wow!
Well, anyhow.
I remember telling joey, god, you`re sweet!`
Or was it pete?...
Well, anyhow.
I wonder why i feel so incomplete.
Something`s missing, joe;
Something`s missing, pete.
Something`s missing here.
Where are my colored lights?
Beats and bleachers and colored lights?
Passing smiles, `round and `round
Thumping oom-pah pah organ sound.
Noisy boys, long and lean.
Giggles of girls in the mezzanine.
Filtered through colored lights,
Gold and amber and green.
And i tried to find the answer in the friends i made,
Or beds i`d share,
Well, anywhere.
But with other people`s music ringing in my ear
I couldn`t sing,
Well, anything.
And i thought if i could just be twelve again,
Or was it ten?
Well, anyway.
It seems to me i knew the secret then.
It`s so simple: twelve.
It`s so simple: ten.
It was simple there.
Passing smiles, `round and `round
Thumping oom-pah-pah organ sound.
Noisy boys, long and lean.
Giggles of girls in the mezzanine
Filtered through colored lights,
Red and orange and gold and amber
And pink and yellow and green.
Leaving home years ago,
What was i looking for?
I don`t know.
I can`t recall well, anyway.
Soon i`ll have my days and nights of
Wonderful, glimmering, beautiful, shimmering
Colored lights!
