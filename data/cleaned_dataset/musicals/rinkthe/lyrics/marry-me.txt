------ Marry Me ------
--- Unknown ---
Marry me.
Come on and marry me.
Why not agree to be my blushing bride?
I know the neighborhood would give its consent, and there's a cutaway
I'm dying to rent the day you marry me
Give in and marry me.
I really love you, see?
We can't go wrong.
That diamond in the store I could pay monthly for.
Come on and marry me.
Marry me
--- Unknown ---
Marry me
So marry me.
Give in and marry me.
Though you don't love me now,
You will in time.
You may not know it yet but I'm the best you'll get.
Wake up and marry me.
Marry me.
