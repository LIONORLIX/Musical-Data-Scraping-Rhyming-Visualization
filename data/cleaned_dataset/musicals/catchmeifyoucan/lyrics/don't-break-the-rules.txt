------ Don't Break The Rules ------
--- Unknown ---
It starts very early once the baby toys are gone
A kid on the playground has to chose what side he's on
It's the bullies or the good guys boy there aint no middle ground
Though hoodlums try to blur the line and twist the truth around
Then they call themselves a winner but they're self-deceiving fools
Cause the game ain't worth winning if you're breaking all the rules

The law is laid upon us when as kids we first ask, "Why?"
Our parents set the rules when Cause I said so! they reply
And though I thought I hated them and screamed with all my might
The next time that I had a choice gee whiz I did what's right
No I never snuck a drink, I never stole a pack of cools
Cause the game ain't worth winning if you're breaking all the rules
--- Unknown ---
Don't break the rules
Or else we're livin in the wild wild west
Don't break the rules
God's keeping score you don't want to fail that test
Don't break the rules
You thumb your nose right at the life for which I strive
But those rules those laws keep us alive

Well it started back with Moses when he led around the Jews
And climed way up that mountain to pick up Gods daily news
He slept up on Mt. Sinai, cried and begged on their behalf
He almost dropped those tablets when he saw that golden calf
Now we teach the ten commandments every Sunday in our schools
Cause the game ain't worth winning if you're breaking all the rules

I guess the constitution boys to some is too complex
They think our founding fathers fought so they can forge some checks
They see themselves as Robin Hood stealing from the rich
Not paying back the things they take well payback is a bitch
Cause the world ain't Sherwood Forest
You can't give away those jewels
And the game ain't worth winning if your breaking all the rules
--- Unknown ---
Don't break the rules
Or else we're livin in the wild wild west
Don't break the rules
Gods keeping score you don't want to fail that test
Don't break the rules
You thumb your nose right at the life for which I strive
But those rules those laws keep us alive

When you steal somebody's money
Screw his daughter or his wife
You don't think of repercussions
As you tap dance through your life
Though you smile like you're a hero
Your an outlet through and through
But the odds are in my favor man
And one day I'll catch you
--- Unknown ---
So go sneak into a movie,
Run the red light, sell some pot
It's all the same to me
You're either guilty or you're not
If we all got what we wanted
Every time we felt the urge,
The world would be in total chaos
It's already on the verge
--- Unknown ---
Yes its laws that keep us human
Cause without them winners lose
And the game ain't worth winning
The game ain't worth winning
The game ain't worth winning
If we're breaking all the rules
--- Unknown ---
Don't break the rules or else we're livin in the wild wild west
Don't break the rules Gods keeping score you don't want to fail that test
Don't break the rules you thumb your nose right at the life for which I strive
But those rules those laws
those rules those laws
those rules those laws
