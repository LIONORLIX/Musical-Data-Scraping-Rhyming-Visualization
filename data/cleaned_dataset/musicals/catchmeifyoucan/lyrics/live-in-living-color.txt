Live in living color
Let me take you for a ride
Yes, I'm live in living color
So sit back and let me be your TV Guide
--- Unknown ---
I've got a story I'd like to tell
But I'm gonna need help to tell it well
I've got a story about fame and money
And it's got more curves than a Playboy bunny
--- Unknown ---
I wanna live, not just survive
I wanna tell my story,
--- Unknown ---
Live in living color (live in living color)
Something special's up tonight
Yes I'm live in living color
Life ain't lived in black and white
--- Unknown ---
I've got a tale of a great romancer
And it's got more moves than a go-go dancer
I've got a story that's fast and slick
And it's got my twists than a peppermint stick
--- Unknown ---
Don't have the time for the nine to five
I've gotta tell my story,
--- Unknown ---
Live and in living color (live in living color)
And it's brought to you by me
Yes I'm live in living color!
This won't fit in your TV
--- Unknown ---
What some name just window dressin'
Everyone knows that it's the clothes that make the man (clothes that make the man)
Play the game, just keep 'em guessin'
Mix and match me, try to catch me
If you can!
--- Unknown ---
I've got a story that's strange but true (ensemble echo)
So come fly with me for a bird's-eye view (ensemble echo)
I've got the world at my command (ensemble echo)
And I'll be your one-man Disney land (ensemble echo)
--- Unknown ---
Don't wanna wait for the cops arrive
I wanna tell my story,
--- Unknown ---
Live and in living color (live in living color)
Tune me in and turn me on
Yes I'm live in living color
Blink your eyes and I'll be gone
--- Unknown ---
Yes I'm live in living color
Tune me in and turn me on
Yes I'm live in living color
--- Unknown ---
Blink your eyes
Blink your eyes
