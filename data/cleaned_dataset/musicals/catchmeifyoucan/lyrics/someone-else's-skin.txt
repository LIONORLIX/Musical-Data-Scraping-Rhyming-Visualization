------ Someone Else's Skin ------
--- FRANK ABAGNALE JR. ---
There?s no phone booth
There?s no cape
There?s no Steve McQueen
To help me make my great escape
--- Unknown ---
How can I fly
Like a hero in the sky?
Be a shooting star
Out in the stratosphere
--- Unknown ---
Where?s the shadow?
He might know
Where?s that searchlight
In the sky to point the way to go?
--- Unknown ---
Through some new cloud
To disappear into the crowd
Though the future?s dark
There?s one thing crystal clear
--- Unknown ---
That there?s no home here
--- JUDGE ---
Son, listen to me. We just need a name. Your mother or your father?
--- FRANK JR. ---
So many voices telling me to choose
--- JUDGE ---
It can get very expensive, people fighting over their children
--- FRANK JR. ---
It?s like a game where either team, I lose
--- PAULA ---
Nobody?s fighting. Frankie, look at me, nobody?s fighting
--- FRANK JR. ---
This kind of noise just makes me want to shout
--- FRANK SR. ---
Frankie, just give him a name and this will all be over. It?s going to be okay
--- FRANK JR. ---
I?d like to buy a one-way ticket out
--- PAULA ---
My brave little soldier, do what you have to do
--- FRANK JR. ---
Rules of the road say don?t look back
Eyes straight ahead, don?t jump the track
Try a new game
--- FRANK SR. ---
I?m sorry, Frank
--- FRANK JR. ---
And pray that I can win
--- FRANK SR. ---
I?ve got no room to move, here
--- FRANK JR. ---
?Cause I just don?t feel at home in mine
So I slip now
Into someone else?s skin
--- Unknown ---
I see the maps from every book I?ve read
The worlds that I have lived inside my head
I thought a love like theirs could never die
If that can fade away, then so can I
--- Unknown ---
At first you see me, then you don?t
Don?t look for me, you know I won?t
Even be there
So let the games begin
--- Unknown ---
?Cause I just don?t feel at home in mine
So I slip now
Into someone else?s skin
Into someone else?s skin
--- Unknown ---
I?m gonna run down the street
Run outta town
I?m gonna run from the home team
And never touch down
--- Unknown ---
Run from the books ?cause it?s all been a fake
I?m gonna run from the choices that I don?t wanna make
School?s not out, but I can?t wait
It?s the perfect time to graduate
--- Unknown ---
Today
I?m gotta run away now
I?ve got to run away
--- Unknown ---
I know they?ll see the truth when I move on
They?ll need each other much more once I?m gone
And then I?m flushed and he?s back on his feet
I?ll pick him up and ride down easy street
--- Unknown ---
No time to cry for all the years
A musty gas tank full of tears
Gets you nowhere
Not the places I want in
--- Unknown ---
?Cause I just don?t feel at home in mine
So I slip now
Into someone else?s skin
Into someone else?s skin
Into someone else?s skin
