------ The Pinstripes Are All That They See ------
--- Frank Sr. ---
When your mother walked into
That dancehall in Mantrichard
What did she see?
Through the haze of champagne
Did she notice my name
Or my college degree?
--- Unknown ---
Kid, what she say... was the uniform!
Through the dirt and debris.
Yes, thoses ladies gave thanks
To us visiting Yanks
'Cause the pinstripes are all that they see.
--- Unknown ---
When a pilot walks onto the plane
All the passengers smile and relax.
Do they know he's still tight
From that party last night
Or the back to back jacks?
--- Unknown ---
No! What they see is the uniform.
How it fits, it fits to a T.
Like the visiting team
That the Yankees will cream
Pinstripes are all that they see.
--- Unknown ---
If you wanna be a someone
You can't act like a bum.
A book's judged by its cover
That's the first rule of thumb.
--- Unknown ---
I wanna see ya take off
Straight to the top floor.
Start dressin' to impress 'em
And son you'll stroll in the front door.
A kid in a man's candy store.
--- Unknown ---
Every lawyer's bespoke to the nines
To a jury he's smart and refined.
--- Unknown ---
Do they see with one look
The defendant's a crook
Or that justice is blind?
--- Unknown ---
What they see is the uniform
As he bargains a plea.
They all cease to desist
He's so hard to resist
'Cause the pinstripes are all that they see.
--- Frank Sr. & Frank Jr. ---
Yes, we're gonna hit the high life
We've only just begun.
We're gunna be together
Frank Sr. and son.
--- Unknown ---
Dine at the Latin quarters
A night cap at Toots Shor
Yeah, we're gonna be at ringside
And life will be better than before
