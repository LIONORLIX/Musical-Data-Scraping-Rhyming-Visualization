------ Willing To Ride ------
--- Rita ---
Change my life. You bet i'm gonna change my life. After all these
Years of moving, i m heading home.
--- Unknown ---
Twelve ocean drive
Right by the shore
Not many rooms
It only has four
--- Unknown ---
But for now
Another marathon
Another dead on my feet
Another time clock to beat
Bruise on my shin
Desperate to win
Just like it's always been
--- Rita ---
Twelve ocean drive
Right by the shore
Is the palace i've been
Longing for
One last marathon
One last marathon
Just one more
--- Unknown ---
Here i go again
I can hear that merry-go-round
And though i never cared much
For the sound
I'm willing to ride
--- Unknown ---
There's the ferris wheel
A miracle, that circle of steel
It's funny how nervous
It's making me feel,
Yet willing to ride
--- Unknown ---
This time
Although i'll do it
I swear it's the last time
I'll ever put myself through it
I have to stop remembering when,
And now must be now and then
Must be then
I'm learning to quiet
That butterfly riot
Inside
I'm willing to ride
--- Unknown ---
(the scene shifts to the entrance of the steel pier.)
--- Unknown ---
But now must be now
And then must be then.
I've struck out before
And i couldn't forget if i tried.
--- Unknown ---
But i'm up to bat again,
Tossing my hat again,
Here i go again,
Willing to ride!
