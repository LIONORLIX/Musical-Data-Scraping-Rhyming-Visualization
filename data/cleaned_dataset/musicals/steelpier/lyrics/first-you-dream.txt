------ First You Dream ------
--- Bill ---
First you dream,
Dream about incredible things
Then you look
And suddenly you have wings.
You can fly you can fly
But first you dream
--- Unknown ---
Now close your eyes- come on. Close your eyes.
Now imagine this: a glorious nighttime sky... A crescent moon...
And the earth is far below as we fly in our plane.
--- Unknown ---
First you dream,
Dream about remarkable times
Close your eyes
And see how your spirit climbs.
You can fly
--- Bill ---
You can soar
Feel the wind
Hear it roar
It's easy now
Imagine that
But first you dream
--- Unknown ---
Now open your eyes.
--- Rita ---
Oh, my god, what's the trick?
--- Bill ---
No trick. Just don't took back. Whenever you're flying, you can never look
Back where you've been. You can only look where you're going. Ever see a
Bird look over its shoulder? No. There's only one way to go. Straight ahead.
--- Unknown ---
Here we are
High above the rooftops
There's a barn
There's a field of corn
And that little white house
Where another you was born
Isn't it fine?
Isn't it fair
Being up here
Looking down there?
--- Bill ---
Take my hand
I promise that i won't let you fall
Don't look back
The looking back could end it all
Off we go to the sky
Straight ahead
You and i
Together now
Together now
But first things first
First you dream
--- Unknown ---
(they kiss.)
--- Rita and bill ---
Off we go
To the sky
Straight ahead
You and i
--- Bill ---
Together now
--- Rita and bill ---
Together now
But first things first
--- Rita and blll ---
First you dream
First you dream
--- Unknown ---
