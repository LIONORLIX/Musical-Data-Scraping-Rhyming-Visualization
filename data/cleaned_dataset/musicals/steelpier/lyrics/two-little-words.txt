------ Two Little Words ------
--- Mick ---
Ladies and gentlemen! This is the moment you've been waiting for.
The moment when a man and a woman make that sacred vow to be faithful forever!
And to start off this evening's ceremony on a high note, let's hear from a new
Discovery - fralinger's littte taffy miss - precious mcguire!
--- Precious ---
Ah!
--- Unknown ---
There are two little words
To lighten up your life
One word is husband
The other is wife
--- Unknown ---
Two little words
To brighten any gloom
One word is bride
The other is groom
--- Precious ---
You can curse the world
You can curse your fate
But you never can disparage
Marriage
--- Unknown ---
And two other words
To tell you what bliss is
One word is mister the other is miss-is
--- Unknown ---
So on the day he gives you the ring
If i were you i'd sing! Sing! Sing!
Ah!
Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!
Ha ha ha ha ha ha
Ah! Ah!
--- Unknown ---
One little song
Keeps bubbling inside
Here comes the groom
Here comes the...
Bride
--- Unknown ---
Thank you very much.

So on the day he gives you the ring
