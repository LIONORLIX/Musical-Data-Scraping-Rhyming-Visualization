--- Shelby ---
Happy - take me with you. We'd make a great team.

Somebody older can teach you things
Somebody older can show you how
Someone who's seen it all
Can help you get through
What you're going through now
--- Unknown ---
Somebody wiser who's been around
Can probably send you safely on your way
Listen and hear what somebody older might say
Someone who'd probably be someone a lot like me
--- Happy ---
Half way there you'd be wondering what you got yourself into.
And once you got there you wouldn't fit in.
--- Shelby ---
Yes, i would
--- Happy ---

--- Happy ---
0h no. You'd he ashamed of me. Good-bye, shelby.
--- Shelby ---
Somebody wiser who's been around
Can probably send you safely on your way
Somebody young needs somebody
Older, it's clear
Someone who'd probably be
Someone a lot like me
