------ Running In Place ------
--- Rita ---
Running in place
All of my life
I'd been running in place
What cuts like a knife
Is the one that i trusted to help me run fast
Has left me behind so i'm finishing
--- Rita ---
And i find that my future's
The same as my past
And i'm running
Running, running, running
--- Unknown ---
Running in place
And struck by the notion
I'm stuck in this space
With no forward motion
After the struggling, the smiling,
The scheming
I'm shaken awake
And i find i've been dreaming
--- Unknown ---
It should be good-bye time
But i'm spending my time
Running, running, running
--- Unknown ---
Why am i stranded here choosing
A life with a man that i'm losing
Why after all that he's done
Don't i know
What to do
How to act
Where to run
--- Unknown ---
Dance
--- Unknown ---
(rita dances, furiously expressing her anger and confusion.)
--- Rita ---
It should be good-bye time
But i'm spending my time
Running, running, running, running
Running, running, running
In place
--- Unknown ---
Scene: the dance floor
