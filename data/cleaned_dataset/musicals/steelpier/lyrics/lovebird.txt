Love bird
I'm feeling blue

We should be two
How can we have love seed to grow

When i'm alone and feeling so low
Solo

Let's make a pair
If you stay away from the world
I'm dreaming of
I'll be a lovebird
With no one to love

With a mate

Love bird

If you stay away
From the world

I'll be a lovebird
A lonely love bird
With no one to love
