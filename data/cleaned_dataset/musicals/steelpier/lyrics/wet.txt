------ Wet ------
--- Unknown ---
Think of all the pleasure you'll get
When you're all wet
Not a trouble you can't forget
When you're all wet
Some folks say that being happy is
Having barrels of cash
But i believe that being happy is
Here a splash
There a splash
--- Unknown ---
Let's get ready, set, and begin
To be all wet
Feel that water lapping your skin
When you're all wet
Come on, let's be a couple of sports
Show your nerve and show your shorts
There's no time for joking
This night could be smoking
--- Unknown ---
Once we both get soaking
Wet
--- Unknown ---
Come on! Take 'em off! All right, i won't look. I promise.

Water games, well,

But she could be
Talking me into them

Start to go down

In her arms,

A nice way to drown

All the rules are broken
When the fire is smokin'
Douse it getting soakin' wet

Let's get ready set and begin
To get
All wet

Come on
Let's be a couple of sports
Show your nerve
And show your shorts
--- Both ---
Come on get ready,
Then let's go
Plunge into that h-2-0
Nothing need be spoken
All taboos are broken
Once we two get soakin' wet
--- Unknown ---
Why be feeling frantic
When you could be all romantic
Having fun in the atlantic
Getting soakin' wet?
