(In The darkness, we hear the sound of a small plane flying overhead.
Bill is lying on the ground; he wears a pilot's uniform. He picks
himself up and finds a raffle ticket in his hand.)
--- BILL ---
All right, I understand. I've got three weeks. Three weeks.

Scene: The beach in front of the Steel Pier in Atlantic City
--- MR. WALKER ---
All marathon dancers, sign up now at the Steel Pier! Sign up now!
--- BILL ---
Excuse me, miss... do you have a partner yet?
--- RITA ---
Do I! You should see who I'm dancing with.
--- BILL ---
I thought you would. After all, you're
Lindy's Lovebird.
--- RITA ---
You remember?
--- MR. WALKER ---
Last call for those without partners. Sign up or sign off.
--- BILL ---
Well, I've got to go. I don't have a partner yet.
--- RITA ---
Good luck, Flyboy. You never know who's waiting for you.
