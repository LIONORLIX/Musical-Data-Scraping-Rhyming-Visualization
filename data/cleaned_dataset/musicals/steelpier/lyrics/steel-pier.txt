Hey what do you need that we don't have right here?
Everything's gonna be all right, rita. You'll see...
--- Unknown ---
Life is a party
Why don't you come
To the steel pier?
--- Unknown ---
No one's ever gloomy or glum
At the steel pier
--- Unknown ---
Dip your toes into the ocean
Rub a little suntan lotion
Pay your dough and ride all the rides
Sit on the boardwalk
Watching the tides...

Mick
Oh how our lovebird's heart must be breaking! Deserted by
The man she loves only moments ago. But she won't let go
Of her dream. No, no. She's going to dance with another
Partner - olympic champion, johnny adel!

(mick signals johnny to start dancing with rita,
But she pushes him away and refuses to move.)
--- Rita ---
Life's a party
Why don't you come
To the steel pier?
--- Mick ---
Come on, rita - dance with johnny.
--- Rita ---
No one's ever
Gloomy or glum
At the steel pier
--- Mick ---
Come on, baby, you don't want to be disqualified, do you?
Dance with johnny. That's a girl.
What a sport, folks! What a sport!
--- Rita ---
Rub a little suntan lotion.
Pay your dough be willing to ride
Sit on the boardwalk
Watching the tide
--- Mick ---
Come on, sweetheart - keep moving now. That a girl.
Dance, rita. You hear me? Dance.
I'm warning you, rita. Dance!
Did you hear me?
I don't know what the hell you think you're doing. Dance!

So watch the joy
Go on and on,
Like this crazy marathon

At the truly uproarious.
Glamorous, glorious...

You just want me to say it? Is that what you want?
Is that the game we're playing now? Fine, i'm gonna say it.
You're out. There. I said it. You're out. You hear me?
You're out.

You're out! You're out!
Everybody dance!
