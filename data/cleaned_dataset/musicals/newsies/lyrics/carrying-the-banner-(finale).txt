Try Bottle Alley or the harbor
Try Central Park, it's guaranteed
Try any banker, bum, or barber ...
They almost all knows how to read!
Summer stinks and winter's waiting
Welcome to New York
Boy, ain't nature fascinating
When youse gotta walk?

It's a fine life
Carrying the banner
It's a fine life
Carrying the banner
It's a fine life
Carrying the banner

You got 'em now, boy!
