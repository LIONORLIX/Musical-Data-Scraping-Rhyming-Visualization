------ Once and for All ------
--- DENTON ---
This is the story you wanted to write,
Well tonight is the night that you can,
--- JACK ---
Just get this done and by dawn's early light
you can finish the fight you began,
--- DAVID ---
This time we are in it to stay,
--- SARAH ---
Think about seising the day,
--- JACK ---
Think of that train as she rolls into old Santa Fe,
Tell em' im on my way,

See old man Pullitzer's snug in his bed
He don't care if we are dead or alive
Three satin pillows are under his head
While we are begging for bread to survive
Joe, if you're still countin' sheep
Wake up and read em' and weep
You got your thugs
With thier sticks and their slugs
Yeah, but we got a promise to keep
--- Unknown ---
Once and for all
Something tells me the tide'll be turnin'
Once and for all
There is a fire inside me
That won't stop burnin'
Now that the choices are clear
Now tomorrow is here
Watch how the mighty will fall
For once and for all
--- MORE NEWSIES ---
This is for kids shinin' shoes in the street
With no shoes on their feet everyday
This is for guys sweatin' blood in the shops
While the bosses and cops look away
This is to even the score
This ain't just Newsies no more
This ain't just kids for some pie in the sky
This is do it or die
This is WAR!
--- Unknown ---
Once and for all
We'll be there to defend one another
Once and for all
Every kid is our friend
Every friend a brother
--- Unknown ---
Five thousand fists in the sky
Five thousand reasons to try
We're goin' over the wall
Better to die then to crawl
Either we stand or we fall
For once
Once and for all
