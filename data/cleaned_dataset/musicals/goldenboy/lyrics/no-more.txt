------ No More ------
--- JOE & CHORUS ---
I gave you my soul --
No more.
Now I'll kiss your eyes
No more.
How I trusted you!
Now I ask what for.
You were life to me --
No more.
--- Unknown ---
Well, you had your chance --
No more.
Now I'll play the fool
No more.
How I needed love,
But you closed the door.
Oh, you'll laugh at me
No more.
--- Unknown ---
How I bled for you!
No more.
Shed my skin for you!
No more.
Oh, I worshipped you,
That you can't ignore,
But I ain't your slave
No more.
--- Unknown ---
Well, you had your way --
No more.
Well, it ain't your day
No more.
Yes, I'm standin' up,
I ain't on the floor,
I ain't bowin' down
No more.
--- Unknown ---
I ain't gonna cry
No more.
No, I ain't gonna cry
No more.
I just wanted love,
Why'd it turn to war?
I ain't bowin' down
------ fin ------
