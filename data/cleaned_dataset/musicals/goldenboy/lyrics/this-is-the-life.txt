------ This Is The Life ------
--- EDDIE ---
This is the life,
Here's where the living is,
This is the life,
Baby, you're there.
This is the life,
You've waited long enough,
Man, you've arrived,
Breathe in that air.
Modern perfume,
Silver and candlelight,
Children, make way,
Joe's here to stay.
Come join the club,
Hear that sweet music start,
This is the life, sweetheart.
--- Unknown ---
Tell them bye-bye,
Get where the action is,
Come have some fun,
I'll lead the way.
This is the life,
They've kept you in a box,
Break down the walls,
Come out and play.
See all the lights,
They're spelling Wellington,
How sweet the song
When you belong.
Top of the heap,
That's how it's got to be,
This is the life, you'll see.
--- JOE & ENSEMBLE ---
Can I be what I wanna be? (Yes, you can!)
Can I get what I wanna get? (Yes, you can!)
Can I have a car with a built-in bar,
Color TV and a Playboy key,
And a hundred shares of AT&T?
Contour chairs, imported booze,
A calendar watch and custom-made shoes,
Photograph in the Daily News,
Ten dollar ties? Yes sir, how many?
You'll get to call Leonard Bernstein Lenny.
Lunch at Shaw's, pick up the tab,
The doorman saying May I get you a cab?
Bartender asking What'll you have?
Charge account at Saks Fifth Ave.
Diamond studs, finest grade,
And every single album Ray Charles ever made.
Polaroid camera, stereo sets,
Season box to see the Mets.
Charcoal grill with a Nathan's frank,
Diner's Club card and money in the bank.
Shave and a haircut --
Me next!
--- JOE & EDDIE ---
This is the life,
Here's where the living is,
This is the life,
Baby, I'm there.
This is for me,
Free, black and twenty-one,
Now I''ve arrived,
Breathe in that air.
This lovely life,
This groovy atmosphere,
Out of my way,
Joe's here to stay.
King of the hill,
That's how it's got to be,
