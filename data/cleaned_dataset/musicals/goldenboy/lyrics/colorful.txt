When I was very young,
Brand new upon the scene,
Had no experience,
That's right, I was green.
Then I grew up a bit,
Found out a thing or two,
Sometimes I'd get unhappy,
In short, I was blue.
As far as politics goes, I never turned red,
I'm smarter than you might think.
And every time I've been told
Boy, you're good as gold,
Say, I'm just tickled pink.
I've tried all kinds of shades
And put them to the test,
But I look at myself
And black suits me best.

Black is chic,
Always correct for the house or yard.
Black is neat,
It goes with everything and doesn't try too hard.
Black is basic, you'll agree.
As the Duchess of Windsor would say, Black is me!

Well, I've been yellow at times, I'm sorry to say,
Yes, I've been afraid to fight.
Drake, I've been scared as can be,
But take it from me,
I ain't never turned white.
So when I'm old and grey,
Heading for my last rest,
Guess I'll still have to say
That black -- not kelly green,
But black -- not tangerine,
