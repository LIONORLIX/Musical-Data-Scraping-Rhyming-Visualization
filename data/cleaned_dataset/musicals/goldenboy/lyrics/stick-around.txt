------ Stick Around ------
--- JOE ---
Stick around, things are gonna happen,
Fireworks, stick around and see.
Watch me in the arena, eat crackerjack
While I'm smackin' some hack for a fee.
Stick around, you can hold the basket
While I shake that money tree.
And of course, in certain cases,
A dark horse may win some races,
Stick around, lady, and see.
--- Unknown ---
Stick around, and you'll see some action,
Who can tell what the kid will do?
Here I go after diamonds, and I'll come back
With a sackful and toss you a few.
Stick around, you can shine my trophies,
Lead the cheers when they shout for me.
And if I come up a winner,
Brotherhood week, take me to dinner,
Stick around, lady, and see the boy who's gonna fight,
See that boy start moving right,
