------ Deep Love ------
--- Elizabeth ---
(spoken) Penny for your thoughts.
You know, until now my life has been nothing but a meaningless world of silly parties.
But I always sensed that something was missing. Love.
And I'm not talkin about puppy love either. A one night stand love or
cheap love. No, what I'm talkin about is-oh, what's the word I'm looking for-ah, yes.
--- Unknown ---
(sung) Deep love. At last I've found deep love.
Been searching for deep love, for all of my life. Long love. Incredibley long
love. A constant and strong love, that rids me of strife. Firm love.
A gentle, but firm love. An unyeilding firm love, for this my heart cries.
Deep love. At last I've found deep love. Now I will keep love forever inside.

Hmmm, well alright. Seven always has been my lucky number.

Wh--what? What is it, what is the matter, is it--is it that music? Oh, forget it.
That's just some poor lonely fool blowin his french horn.
Wh--where are you going? You're walking out on me? Me?!
Oh, you men are all alike.
Five or six quick ones and you're off with the boys to boast and brag.
WELL YOU BETTER KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT!!!
Oh, I think I love him.
(sung) Deep love. At last I found deep love.
Now I will keep love deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper and
