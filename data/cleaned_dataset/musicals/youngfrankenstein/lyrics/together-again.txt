------ Together Again ------
--- IGOR (spoken) ---
Oh, the fantastic things we'll do. It'll be like old time. You and me. Right up there with the world's greatest pairs!
--- Unknown ---
(sung)
Like Laurel and Hardy,
Like Coke and Baccardi
Like Juliet and Romeo,
Ebb and flow,
To and fro,
Together, together again . . .
Together again for the first time,
We've only met in a dream!
Up until now it's been the worst time, But now that you're here,
We're a team!
--- Unknown ---
Together again for the first time,,
Haven't a woe or a care,
No longer a bad and accursed time,
It's easy to see,
You have to agree,
We're destined to be a great pair!
--- Unknown ---
All of my life
I've been stoogin' around,
Nothin' to do, at a loss,
All of my life
I've been stoogin' around
But what good is a stooge
If he ain't got a boss?!
--- Unknown ---
Together again for the first time,
Back on the track to renown,
We're gonna thrill 'em,
We're gonna kill 'em,
--- Unknown ---
You'll be the teacher,
We'll make a new creature,
And scare the bloomin' daylights
Right outta this town!
--- FREDERICK (spoken) ---
No, stop it! Stop it! You don't understand. I'll only be here for a few days, to settle my grandfather's estate, and then
I'm heading straight back to New York. No laboratories, no creatures.
--- IGOR ---
Bet you change your mind, master. C'mon, join in a chorus. It's fun!
--- FREDERICK ---
My dear Igor, I happen to be the Dean of Anatomy at a world-renowned School of Medicine. Although I do sing a bit. And
was, in fact, a Wiffenpoof at Yale.
--- IGOR ---
A Wiffenpoof, wow! C'mon, doc, nobody's around.
--- FREDERICK ---
Well . . . nobody is around . . . what the hell . . .
--- Unknown ---
(sung)
Together again for the first time
Haven't a woe or a care!
--- IGOR ---
Together again for the first time
Haven't a woe or a care!
This is the best time
--- FREDERICK ---
No longer a bad and accursed time,
It's easy to see
--- IGOR ---
You have to agree
--- IGOR & FREDERICK ---
We're destined to be a great pair!
--- FREDERICK (spoken) ---
May I?
--- IGOR ---
Take it!
--- FREDERICK (sung) ---
All of my life
I've been bossing around,
Mean and alone, like a Scrooge,
All of my life
I've been bossing around,
But what good is a boss
If he ain't got a stooge?!
--- Unknown ---
(spoken)
Oh! I'm sorry, I don't wish to embarrass you, but I am a rather brilliant surgeon. Perhaps I could help you with that hump.
--- IGOR ---
What hump?
--- IGOR & FREDERICK (sung) ---
Together again for the first time,
We've only met in a dream
--- FREDERICK ---
Like Ginger and Freddie
--- IGOR ---
MacDonald and Eddy
--- FREDERICK ---
Like San Juan and Teddy
--- IGOR ---
Or meatballs and spaghetti
--- FREDERICK & IGOR ---
But the pair that we cry for
The pair that we sigh for,
Tha pair that we die for,
Is Fron-kon-steen and Eye-gore,
For the first time,
Together again!
--- IGOR (spoken) ---
Walk this way.
No, this way.
Really drag your foot.
Can you go left more?
--- IGOR & FREDERICK (sung) ---
Together again for the first time,
We've only met in a dream
--- FREDERICK ---
Like Gimbel and Macy
--- IGOR ---
Like Hepburn and Tracy
--- FREDERICK ---
Like Lombard and Gable
--- IGOR ---
Like good old Cain and Abel
--- IGOR & FREDERICK ---
For the first time,
Together again!
