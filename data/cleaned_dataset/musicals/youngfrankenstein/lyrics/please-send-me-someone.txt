------ Please Send Me Someone ------
--- Hermit ---
Oh, Lord, please take pity!
I'm blind and oh so lonely!

(sung)
Someone,
Send me someone
I need someone
Who will care
--- Unknown ---
Someone,
Send me someone
A friend to end despair
--- Unknown ---
Someone to comfort my soul,
Someone to make my life whole,
Can you hear me?
--- Unknown ---
Someone,
I'm praying for someone,
I'm saying there's someone
Out there for me!
--- Unknown ---
Each night I'm yearning,
Tossing and turning,
Dreaming my dream comes true!
--- Unknown ---
Someone,
Please send me someone,
I'm so blue.

(spoken)
Oh, lordy. Look down on your poor blind hermit.
It's been so long since I felt the touch of someone's hand,
so long since I heard the sound of someone's voice.
Each night, all I hear is the wind in the trees, and if I'm lucky, an or maybe...a cricket.
Oh, Lord, let's face it, we're talkin' LONELY here.

Can you hear me?
Someone,

Out there for me.

Each night I'm yearning,
Tossing and turning,
Dreaming my dream comes true!
--- Unknown ---
Someone,
Please send me someone,
Dear God, send someone
