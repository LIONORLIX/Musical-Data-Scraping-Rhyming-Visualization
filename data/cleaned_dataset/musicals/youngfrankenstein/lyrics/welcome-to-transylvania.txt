Hmmmmm...
--- Unknown ---
Welcome to Transylvania,
We're very happy that you're here!
Welcome to Transylvania,
We greet you with a mighty cheer!
Chalujnik!
--- Kemp ---
We're considered both a Death and a Tourist Trap
--- All Five ---
Thanks to all the Frankensteins,
You put us on the map!

So...
--- Village Quartet ---
Welcome to Transylvania
--- Kemp ---
Though vampires suck your blood at night,
and werewolves prowl in the pale moonlight
--- All Five ---
And zombies have a tendency to roam,
It's the place that we humbly call Home
