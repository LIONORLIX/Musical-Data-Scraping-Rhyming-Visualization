------ He's Loose ------
--- Three Solo Villagers ---
He's Loose!
He's Loose!
He's Loose, He's Loose, He's Loose!
He's Loose, He's Loose, He's Loose!
He's Loose!
He's Loose!
He's Loose!
--- Igor ---
Aghhh!
--- Kemp ---
They released a horror,
they released a fright!
Lurking in the darkness,
waiting in the night!
--- Unknown ---
For this act of madness
There is no excuse!
Don't you see, he is free
--- The Villagers ---
He's Loose, He's loose, he's loose!
--- Kemp ---
He will sack our village,
He will break our backs!
He will rape and pillage,
stop him in his tracks!
--- The Villagers ---
Catch him by the neck
Put it in a noose!
--- Unknown ---
Can't you see,
He is free!
He's loose!
He's loose!
He's loose!
--- Frau Blucher ---
Here, Creature! I won't hurt you!
--- The Villagers ---
Search the marshes,
ev'ry glade and glen!
Catch the monster before he strikes again!
--- Kemp ---
Bar your windows, lock your dwellings
Hello heartaches, goodbye kvellings
Ev'ryone!
Ev'ryone!
--- The Villagers ---
Search each hill and valley,
find which way he fled!
Comb each street and alley,
or else we'll all be dead!
--- Kemp ---
He's loose!
He's loose!
--- The Villagers ---
He's loose!
He's loose!
He's loose!
He's loose!
He's loose!
He's loose!
