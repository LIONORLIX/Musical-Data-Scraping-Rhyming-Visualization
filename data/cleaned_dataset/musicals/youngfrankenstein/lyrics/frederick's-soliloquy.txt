------ Frederick's Soliloquy ------
--- Kemp ---
Do you have any last words before we string you up, Dr. Fronkensteen?
--- Frederick ---
Just this...
Though my time on earth is done,
Though I face this angry crowd
Though I'm hated and despised
Of one thing I can say I'm proud
This is truly mine
I'm a man who has no shame
I'm shouting out my family name
