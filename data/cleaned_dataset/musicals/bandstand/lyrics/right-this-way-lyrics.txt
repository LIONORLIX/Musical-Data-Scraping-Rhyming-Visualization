------ Right This Way Lyrics ------
--- Unknown ---
There is a train
it leaves the station at a quarter after five
and it’s direct
from union terminal right there at public square
a quarter after five
and where does it arrive?
At Grand Central Station
--- Unknown ---
The Cleveland Limited of New York Central Railroad has first class pullman cars
for big time movie stars
and we’re gonna take one
--- Unknown ---
I see it all
the leather seat
the steak we’ll eat
and then that train conductor’s call
--- Unknown ---
he’ll say right this way
we reserved this just for you
you’ve been waiting for this day
it’s the least that we can do
let me take your bags my friend
you’ve been carrying those far too long
troubled times are at an end
and we’re waiting to hear your song
it’s a privilege sir, may i say?
right this way
--- Unknown ---
and in times square
the hotel Astor stands 11 stories high
a first class grand hotel
the lobby’s in a movie that i saw last month as well
with garland and walker
--- Unknown ---
and on the top
a rooftop garden with a bandstand in the sky
cream of the crop
where Dorsey swings and Ella sings
and I swear someday so will I
--- Unknown ---
they’ll say right this way
we’ve reserved this just for you
you’ve been waiting for this day
it’s the last that we can do
--- Unknown ---
you’ve arrived at last my friend
you’ve been fighting for far too long
--- Unknown ---
after bunks on cargo ships
after trenches in the rain
after running for cover while dodging the flack
and 3 years and 8 months to fight my way back
and losing my faith
while busting my ass
--- SPOKEN ---
I think we’re entitled to travel first class
don’t you?
--- Unknown ---
How?
--- SUNG ---
whatever gigs
whatever dates whatever bookings we can get
we’ll take ‘em all
if there’s a club in town where we can play a set
we are not finished
there’s liquor dives
and party rooms
and VA halls, I bet (Right!)
we fight for ourselves now
--- Unknown ---
and all of the wrongs will be made right this way
--- Unknown ---
we’ll be right this way (right this way)
after all that we’ve been through (what we’ve been through)
we’ve been waiting for this day (been waiting)
its the least that they can do (at last)
we’ve arrived at last my friend (my friend)
we’ve been fighting for far too long (far too long)
troubled times are at an end (are at an end)
and they’re waiting to hear our song
--- Unknown ---
you can bet we intend to stay right this way
