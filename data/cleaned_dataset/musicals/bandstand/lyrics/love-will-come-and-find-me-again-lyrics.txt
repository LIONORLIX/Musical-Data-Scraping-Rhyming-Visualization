------ Love Will Come and Find Me Again Lyrics ------
--- Unknown ---
Once upon a time, I would wake beside a man,
Who would make me feel like nothing could take him from me
Once I thought forever was real,
I thought my life was ideal,
I though that nothing could steal it, you see
--- Unknown ---
Once I learned how wrong I had been,
That sometimes dreams can cave in and what then?
Once I learned the hard way,
Faith in ever after was done,
And I gave up ever wondering when,
Love will come and find me again
--- Unknown ---
And it's almost like time has stood still,
Like a lifetime iced under a frost,
And I don't try to warm from the chill,
Although I know how much I've lost,
--- Unknown ---
Trouble is, the more you deny,
The more you don't even try,
The more the world passes by in a haze,
Soon you find you don't even know how many years you let go,
The chances wasted in so many ways,
--- Unknown ---
Lately I've been thinking it's time
To take a look at what I'm doing then, clinging to if only,
Heaven knows there's more than one man
And maybe I should be planning for when,
Love will come and find me again,
--- Unknown ---
Letting go of what might have been,
And letting something else in only then,
