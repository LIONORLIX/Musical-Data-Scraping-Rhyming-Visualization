------ Who I Was ------
--- Unknown ---
You know what I want even more
Is to be just who I was before
--- Unknown ---
Self-assured, future all secured
That was Julia
Quick to trust, saw the world as just
That was Julia
--- Unknown ---
Full of promise and full of poise
Hardly any of which this shop girl now employs
But I muddle through...
--- Unknown ---
Easy smile, avid cinephile
That was Julia
That was Julia
Before being branded a gold star wife
A distinction that's redefining my whole life
--- Unknown ---
Well, it feels like it does
I feel guilty because
There are days when I just want to be who I was
--- Unknown ---
I'm not saying I'd trade the life that I had with him for a minute
That was once in a lifetime love and I know I was lucky to win it
--- Unknown ---
And I'm told to be proud
All the newsreels and magazines practically shout it
But I'm never allowed
To admit there is nothing remotely heroic about it
--- Unknown ---
And you know I would never be able
To say that away from this dining room table...
--- Unknown ---
Not a doubt how her life played out
That was Julia
All the details of who I am
Made irrelevant with one single telegram
--- Unknown ---
That's what widowhood does
I resent it because
There are days when I just want to be
Momentarily free
