------ Welcome Home 2 ------

Johnny made it home.
Most of him at least.
Had three operations,
but the pain has not decreased.
Nick learned to survive, needs to never trust
Once you see the worst in man then how do you adjust?
Davy cracks a joke, claims to be alright.
Drinks a fifth of vodka in his kitchen every night.
And I stand here trying,
Like Mother Mary with my private burden of grief to carry.
Welcome home my boys
Welcome home my sons
Welcome home my husband
Welcome home my love
Welcome home, welcome home
Welcome home
Wayne is never free, schedules out his day
Filling every minute just to keep the ghosts away
He could never get back the life he had,
Faced with raising kids who did not recognize their dad
Jimmy made it back to town four months ago
Lived to tell of things no one could bear to know
Keeps his guard up now a lot goes undiscussed
Focuses on fighting what he finds unjust
Welcome home my boys
Welcome home my sons
Welcome home my husband
Welcome home my love
Welcome home, welcome home
Welcome home
Donny does his best, trying to pretend
What he doesn’t talk about won’t matter in the end.
Donny made it home but thinks it wasn’t fair
How he made it out but left his buddy there
Donny doesn’t sleep because the nightmares come
Donny wants an answer
Donny looks for absolution
And I would give up anything if I could give him some
If I stand here helpless, my arms extended
Knowing full well, darling, your war’s not ended
Welcome home
Welcome home my husband
Welcome my love
Welcome home, welcome home
Welcome home my boys
Welcome home my sons
Welcome home my husband
Welcome home my love
Welcome home
Welcome home
