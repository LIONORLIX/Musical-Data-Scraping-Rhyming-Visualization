------ All I Need ------
--- Unknown ---
Forgive this fool, my darlin'
--- Unknown ---
Oh, this heart of mine
Carries a heavy load
When I think about
How I've hurt you so
--- Unknown ---
After you've been
Been so good to me
I've been unfaithful, darlin'
I've caused you misery
--- Unknown ---
A feeling of guilt
How it tortures me
And only you, my darlin'
Oh, can set me free and
--- Unknown ---
Darlin', all
All I need
Is just to hear you say
You'll forgive me
Forgive me, baby
All, all I need
To have you touch my hand
Say you'll understand
--- Unknown ---
A moment of weakness, darlin'
Caused me to stray
Your trust in me, dear
I threw away
--- Unknown ---
When I look
Look into your eyes
I can see the hurt, baby
That you feel inside
--- Unknown ---
Although I hurt you, baby
You never once complained
It makes me feel, sweet darlin'
That much more ashamed
Tears of guilt, tears of guilt
Runnin' down my face
Tears that only you, baby
Only you can erase and
--- Unknown ---
Darlin', all
All I need
Is just to hear you say
You'll forgive me
Forgive me, baby
All, all I need
To have you touch my hand
Say you'll understand
--- Unknown ---
Forgive this fool, my darlin'
--- Unknown ---
I know I made a big mistake
When all your love, darlin'
Yes, I did forsake
It's on my mind
It's in my heart
This guilty feeling
Tearin' me apart
--- Unknown ---
With every step I make
Every breath I take
I'll make it up to you
I'll make it up to you
--- Unknown ---
Undo the wrong I've done
Undo the wrong I've done
I've been unfaithful
I know it's true
But I'll make it up to you, baby
--- Unknown ---
All, all I need
Is just to hear you say
You'll forgive me
Forgive me baby
All, all I need
To have you touch my hand
Say you'll understand
