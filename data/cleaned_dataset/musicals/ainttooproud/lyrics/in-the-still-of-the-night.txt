------ In the Still of the Night ------
--- Unknown ---
In the still of the night
I held you
Held you tight
'Cause I love
Love you so
Promise I'll never
Let you go
In the still of the night
--- Unknown ---
I remember
That night in May
The stars were bright above
--- Unknown ---
I'll hope and I'll pray
To keep
Your precious love
--- Unknown ---
Well before the light
Hold me again
With all of your might
In the still of the night
--- Unknown ---
So before the light
Hold me again
With all of your might
In the still of the night
