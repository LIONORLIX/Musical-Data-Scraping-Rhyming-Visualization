------ Get Ready ------
--- Unknown ---
I never met a girl who makes me feel the way that you do
Whenever I'm asked who makes my dreams real
I say that you do
So fee fi fo fum
Look out baby 'cause here I come
And I'm bringing you a love that's true so get ready
So get ready
I'm gonna try to make love to you so get ready
So get ready here I come
I'm on my way
If you wanna play hide and seek with love let me remind you
The loving you're gonna miss and the time it takes to find you
So fiddle-lee-dee fiddle-lee-dum
Look out baby 'cause here I come
And I'm bringing you a love that's true so get ready
So get ready
I'm gonna try to make love to you so get ready
So get ready here I come
I'm on my way
All my friends shouldn't want me to I understand it
I hope I'll get to you before they do the way I planned it
So twiddle-dee-dee twiddle dee dum
Look out baby 'cause here I come
And I'm bringing you a love that's true so get ready
So get ready
I'm gonna try to make love to you so get ready
So get ready here I come
I'm on my way
Get ready 'cause here I come, boy
Get ready 'cause here I come, boy
Get ready 'cause here I come, boy
