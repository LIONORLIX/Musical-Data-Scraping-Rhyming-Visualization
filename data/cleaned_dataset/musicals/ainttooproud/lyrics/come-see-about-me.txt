------ Come See About Me ------
--- Unknown ---
I've been crying, 'cause I'm lonely for you
Smiles have all turned to tears
But tears won't wash away the fears
That you're never ever gonna return
To ease the fire that within me burns
--- Unknown ---
It keeps me crying baby for you
Keeps me sighin' baby for you
So won't you hurry?
Come on boy, see about me
See about you, baby
--- Unknown ---
I've given up my friends just for you
My friends are gone and you have too
No peace shall I find
Until you come back and be mine
No matter what you do or say
I'm gonna love you anyway
--- Unknown ---
Keep on crying, baby for you
I'm gonna keep sighin', baby for you
So come on, hurry
Come on and see about me
See about you, baby
--- Unknown ---
Sometimes up, sometimes down
My life's so uncertain with you not around
From my arms you maybe out of reach
But my heart says you're here to keep
--- Unknown ---
Keeps me crying, baby for you
Keep on, keep on crying, baby for you
So won't you hurry?
Come on boy, see about me
See about you, baby
--- Unknown ---
You know I'm so lonely
I love you only
See about your, baby
