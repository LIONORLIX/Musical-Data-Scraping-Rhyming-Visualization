------ (I Know) I'm Losing You ------
--- Unknown ---
Your love is fading
I can feel your love fading
Girl it's fading
Away from me
Cause your touch, your touch, has grown cold
As if somebody else controls your very self
I've fooled myself... Long as I can...
Can feel the presence... Of another man;
It's there when you speak to me
It's just not the same
Ooooh, Baby,
I'm losing you
It's in the air
It's Everywhere
Ooooh, Baby,
I'm losing you
When I look into your eyes
A refelction of a face I see
I'm hurt, downhearted, and worried girl
Cause that face doesn't belong to me
Oh, it's there on your face;
Someone's taken my place...
Ooooh, Baby,
I'm losing you
You try hard to hide
the emptiness inside
Oooh, child,
I'm losing you
I don't wanna lose you
I can tell when we kiss
Something's just gone amiss
Ooooh, Baby,
I'm losing you
I can feel it in my bones
Any day you'll be gone
Ooooh, Baby,
I'm losing you
