------ You Mean More To Me ------
--- Unknown ---
Bob Cratchit: I don't need a fortune,
Hidden in a shoe,
Many men have fortunes,
But they don't have you.
When I look at you, I'm richer than a king,
Yes, you mean more to me than anything.

Bundled up with string.

Bob Cratchit: How much is it?

You mean more to me,
