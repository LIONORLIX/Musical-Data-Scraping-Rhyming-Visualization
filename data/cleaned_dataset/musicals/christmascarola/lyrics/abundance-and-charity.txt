(The jolly Ghost of Christmas Present appears in Scrooge?s room.)
--- GHOST OF CHRISTMAS PRESENT ---
You call this Christmas dinner?
This measly pot of gruel?!
You aren?t just a sinner,
You?re an outright fool!
Why, the present?s full of pleasures!
Things to see, enjoy, and taste!
And at Christmas no one measures
His wallet or his waist!
So I?ve done you just a teeny tiny favor!
Oh, don?t thank me.
It?s perfectly free.
Just a new experience to savor ?
Some laughter, some magic ? on me!

In your heart!

My fabulous fruit of the fine!

A sweet, sir!
A little indulgence and then,
Abundance!  Charity!
Good will toward men!
