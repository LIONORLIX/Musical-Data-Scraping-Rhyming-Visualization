-GHOST OF JACOB MARLEY-
It is required of every man,
that his spirit travel far.
Lending help to those he can,
no matter who they are.
But if you don't go forth in life,
spreading joy and easing pain,
your spirit will go forth in death,
and you shall wear a chain!
--- Unknown ---
These were coins I hoarded for a rainy day,
now with every jingle I'm distressed!
Locks and keys that helped me keep the poor away...
That's what put these locks and keys around my waist..
--- Unknown ---
Link by link,
my chain was getting longer!
Link by link,
I should've heard a clink!
Link by link,
each year a little stronger..
Link by link by HORRIFYING link!
--- Unknown ---
Stacking up my silver and my bits of gold,
filling up my vault when day was done!
Well, vaults are made of lead
and cash is very cold!
And around your neck they weigh a bloody ton!
--- Unknown ---
Link by link,
You're on the brink.
It's written here,
in blood-red ink.
Unlock your heart!
It's not too late!
For you'll be dragging something more than
twice this weight!

Singing sorry spirits who were once like you!*
Dragging chains are all that we've acquired.
