------ A Place Called Home (Reprise) ------
--- EMILY ---
There’s a place called home
I can almost see
With a red front door
And a roaring fire
And a Christmas tree
Yes, a place called home
Full of love and family
And I’m there at the door
Watching you come home to me
--- YOUNG SCROOGE ---
Through the years
I’ll recall this day
--- YOUNG SCROOGE, EMILY ---
In your arms
When I finally found my way
--- EMILY ---
To a place called home
And a life for two
--- YOUNG SCROOGE ---
You’ll have everything
You could ever want
--- EMILY ---
All I want is you
--- YOUNG SCROOGE, EMILY ---
And a place called home
You and I will always be
--- EMILY ---
In the dark of the night
Let your heart come home to me
--- Unknown ---
(Scrooge watches them with great emotion.)
--- SCROOGE ---
Through the years
I’ve recalled this day
--- YOUNG SCROOGE, EMILY ---
In your arms
--- SCROOGE ---
In your arms
--- YOUNG SCROOGE, EMILY, SCROOGE ---
When I finally found my way
To a place called home
--- YOUNG SCROOGE, EMILY ---
And a life with you
--- EMILY ---
Where the days are long
--- YOUNG SCROOGE ---
And the love is strong
--- YOUNG SCROOGE, EMILY ---
And the dreams are true
SCROOGE
And the dreams are true
--- YOUNG SCROOGE, EMILY ---
Just a place called home
You and I will always be
SCROOGE
Always be
--- EMILY ---
In the dark of the night
Let your heart come home to me
--- YOUNG SCROOGE, EMILY, SCROOGE ---
To the place in my heart
