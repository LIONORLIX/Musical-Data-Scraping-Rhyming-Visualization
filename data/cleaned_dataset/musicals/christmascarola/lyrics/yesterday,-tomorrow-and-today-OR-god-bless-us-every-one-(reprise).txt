------ Yesterday, Tomorrow and Today / God Bless Us Every One (Reprise) ------
--- SCROOGE ---
I have seen a future
Full of darkness,
All the darkness of my heart!
At my door
A world in need of kindess.
From man?s kindness, I departed!
All the hours of my days
And years I?ve wasted!
All the joy and love
I never tasted!
All the errors of the past
Replaced with
Something strange?
Give me time to change!
--- Unknown ---
I can see a future full of beauty,
And my spirit starts to fly!
I can change the world,
Yes, it?s my duty!
God forgive me!
Let me try!
I?ll spend my fortune
On the ones who need me,
Go where kindness
And my conscience lead me,
Give my heart and soul to all!
God speed me on my way,
And to God I pray,
Let the Christmas spirit
Live within me,
Yesterday, tomorrow, and today!
