------ It's All Up To Lady Luck! ------
--- Buck ---
In poker she's the one who helps you draw an inside straight.
--- Conchita ---
Or cause the horse your betting on to never leave the gate.
--- Sherrif Toady ---
In blackjack she decides if you get twenty-one or bust.
--- All Three ---
She's surely not the type f dame that you would want to trust.
It's all up to Lady Luck. It's all up to Lady Luck.
Cause she's the one who's choosing if you're winning or you're loosing.
It's all up to Lady Luck.
--- Buck ---
One minute Lady Luck is with you then she's skipping town.
--- Conchita ---
One day she's got you riding high and than she drops you down.
--- Sherrif Toady ---
Sometimes she let's you win so much your pockets overflow.
--- All Three ---
But just as fast as you can get it she can make it go.
It's all up to Lady Luck. It's all up to Lady Luck.
When she is on your side just tell the dealer, Let it ride! It's all up to Lady Luck.
--- Don Alfredo ---
In gambling I don't got no choice,
I guess that I am stuck with that two timing, double dealing gal called Lady Luck.
I don't know if her luck is good or bad, but what the heck?
Why don't we get it over with? Come on, let's cut the deck!
--- All ---
It's all up to Lady Luck. It's all up to Lady Luck.
--- Don Alfredo ---
Will she decide to smile on me?
Or in a little while will I be left alone to wallow in the muck? It's all up-
--- All ---
It's all up to Lady Luck!
