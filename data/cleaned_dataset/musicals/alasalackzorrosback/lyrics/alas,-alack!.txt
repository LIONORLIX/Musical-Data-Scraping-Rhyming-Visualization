------ Alas, Alack! ------
--- Unknown ---
Alas! Alack!
My poor aching back!
I spend half my life on my knees!
I don't know why I must
Always sweep,scrub and dust
While the others do just as they please.
Alas! Alack!
My future looks black
If there's nothing else I can do
Except cleaning the grime
Until quitting time.
And that's not much to look forward to,
'Cause when work is done
It is not very fun
Going home to my run-
Down shack.
