------ You're Beautiful ------
--- EDWARD ---
You can do this
I'll show you how
It doesn't matter if they were mean to you
We'll go together
--- VIVIAN (spoken) ---
We're going now?
But I'm afraid,
Can't you see it in my face?
--- EDWARD ---
With confidence and attitude
You can walk into any room
Just like you own the place
You're beautiful
You've got style and grace
There's something about your smile that says you're on your way
And you're beautiful
Anyone can see
If you were meant to be anywhere
This is where you're meant to be
You're beautiful
(spoken) I'd like to speak to the manager
--- MR. HOLLISTER (spoken) ---
I'm the manager, Mr. Hollister. How may I help you?
--- EDWARD (spoken) ---
Edward Lewis. You see this lovely young lady?
Do you have anything in this shop as beautiful as she is?
--- MR. HOLLISTER (spoken) ---
Oh, yes.
No, no, no, I'm saying we have many things as beautiful
As she would want them to be
--- EDWARD (spoken) ---
Hollister, we're gonna need a lot of people helping us out
Because we are going to be spending an obscene amount of money in here
--- MR. HOLLISTER (spoken) ---
Mary Pat? Mary Kate? Mary Francis? Quickly
We have an important client to suck up to here
--- MARY PAT ---
You've got that look
--- STORE STAFF ---
You've got that look
--- MARY PAT ---
It really shows
--- STORE STAFF ---
It really shows
--- MARY PAT ---
I can see you walk down Rodeo Drive
--- MARY PAT & STORE STAFF ---
Turning heads everywhere you go
--- MARY PAT:                                                MR. HOLLISTER ---
No looking back                                          No looking back now
Now you've arrived                                     Now you've arrived
--- MARY PAT & MR. HOLLISTER ---
It's time to show them who you are
--- MARY PAT, MR. HOLLISTER & STORE STAFF ---
And no one's gonna stop you now
So hold your head up high
--- STORE STAFF ---
You're beautiful
You've got style and grace
There's something about your smile
That says you're on your way
You're beautiful
--- MR. HOLLISTER (spoken) ---
Now, sir, exactly how obscene an amount of money
Were you talking about?
Just profane, or really offensive?
--- EDWARD (spoken) ---
Really offensive
--- MR. HOLLISTER (spoken) ---
I like him so much!
--- EDWARD ---
The way she walks, the way she smiles
--- STORE STAFF ---
The way she smiles
--- EDWARD ---
She's got the look, she's got the style
--- STORE STAFF ---
Got that style
--- EDWARD & STORE STAFF ---
This is her moment
--- EDWARD ---
Let everyone know
--- STORE STAFF ---
Let 'em know, let 'em know
--- EDWARD ---
I'm liking what I see
--- STORE STAFF ---
She's got the grace, she's got the groove
--- EDWARD ---
I'm starting to believe
--- STORE STAFF ---
There's magic in the way she moves
--- EDWARD ---
In her and me
--- STORE STAFF ---
She can take you with her,
Wherever she goes
Where she goes, where she goes
Where she goes, where she goes
You're beautiful!
--- VIVIAN (spoken) ---
Hang on, there's something I have to do
--- SALESWOMAN #1 (spoken) ---
Hello. May I help you?
--- VIVIAN (spoken) ---
No thank you. Hi, do you remember me?
--- SALESWOMAN #2 (spoken) ---
No, I'm sorry
--- VIVIAN (spoken) ---
I was in here yesterday. You wouldn't wait on me
--- SALESWOMAN #2 (spoken) ---
Oh
--- VIVIAN (spoken) ---
You work on commission, right?
--- SALESWOMAN #2 (spoken) ---
Yes
--- VIVIAN (spoken) ---
Big mistake. Big. Huge.
I have to go shopping now
--- EDWARD & ENSEMBLE ---
You're beautiful
--- VIVIAN ---
I feel a strange
--- EDWARD & ENSEMBLE ---
You've got style and grace
--- VIVIAN, EDWARD & ENSEMBLE ---
There's something about
--- VIVIAN & EDWARD ---

--- ENSEMBLE ---
Your smile

There's something about this
--- EDWARD ---
Girl

If you were meant to be anywhere,
This is where you're meant to be
--- VIVIAN                                                               ENSEMBLE ---
I made the deal, they got me here                        Beautiful
I never thought this could happen to me                Beautiful
It's not the clothes, it's what's inside                     Beautiful
And for the first time I can see                             Beautiful
I'm on my way
I'm on my way
--- EDWARD & ENSEMBLE ---
You're beautiful!
