On a night like tonight, just remember you're right
Where you're meant to be
In a dazzling dress, I'm sure you'll impress
This I guarantee
He's certain to be enchanted by the magic of your smile
Anything's possible on a night like tonight

When you walk in the room, heads will turn, I presume
You'll have style and grace
A tango for two, picture him holding you
In a warm embrace
Dancing on air, without a care to your heart's delight
You'll be unstoppable
