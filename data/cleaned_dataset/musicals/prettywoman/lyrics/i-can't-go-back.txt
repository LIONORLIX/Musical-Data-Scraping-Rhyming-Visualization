------ I Can't Go Back ------
--- VIVIAN ---
You make me happy
You know just what to say
But I ain't Cinderella
Who'd wanna be anyway.
Of all the things I wanted
One thing I never got
Was to be treated like somebody
Just to have one shot
--- Unknown ---
I can't go back
No, I can't go back
--- Unknown ---
But now you've got me thinking
About working on a dream
I'm not quite there yet
I'm somewhere in-between
I hear you talking how
I deserve the best
A voice inside my head keeps sayin'
Don't settle for less
--- Unknown ---
I can't go back
I've seen a different world
I can't go back
I'm a different girl
I can't go back
To who I was before
I can't go back
I always wanted more
--- Unknown ---
I have regrets
But I can't change the past
I want the real thing
Is that too much to ask
For the first time in my life
It gets to be my choice
I feel I've found myself yeah
Now I've found my voice
--- Unknown ---
I can't go back
I've seen a different world
I can't go back
I'm a different girl
I can't go back
To who I was before
I can't go back
I always wanted more
--- Unknown ---
I can see my future
In all my plans
I'm gonna be ok
This is who I am
--- Unknown ---
It's true I sold my body
But I never sold my soul
I learned I don't need anyone
It's me who's in control
They can take away my innocence
But they can't erase my pride
I've seen a better life
I've seen the other side
--- Unknown ---
I can't go back
I've seen a different world
I can't go back
I'm a different girl
I can't go back
To who I was before
I can't go back
I can't go back
No I can't go back
