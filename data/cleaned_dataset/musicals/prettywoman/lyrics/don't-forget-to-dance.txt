------ Don't Forget to Dance ------
--- SCARLETT ---
The world may be your oyster
The best things might be free
But the view from the top
Ain't what it's all cracked up to be
It started with a glance
Yeah, don't forget to dance
--- SCARLETT & HAPPY MAN ---
I see how much you care
And I hope that you will find
A cure for every problem
That guy poses
--- SCARLETT ---
So take some time for you
--- HAPPY MAN ---
*scatting*
--- SCARLETT ---
Things will work out in the end
--- SCARLETT & HAPPY MAN ---
'Cause every now and then
You got to stop and smell the roses

When life delivers lemons (lemons)
Make some lemonade (make some lemonade)
When takin' in the top
Free of all the promises you've made
--- SCARLETT ---
No matter what your circumstance
--- HAPPY MAN & ENSEMBLE ---
What your circumstance
