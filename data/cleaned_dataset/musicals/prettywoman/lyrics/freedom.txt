------ Freedom ------
--- EDWARD ---
What a strange night
And yet it feels right
How was I to know
She would show me
Who I could really be?
I can't keep holdin' on
I've got to let it go
--- Unknown ---
Was that freedom, freedom?
When we were dancin' on the floor
I felt freedom, sweet freedom
Like I've never felt before
And I know that I need more
--- Unknown ---
Meeting big wheels
Makin' big deals
It's all I've ever known
In the boardroom
With a silver spoon
I've got everything I need
But somehow I'm still alone
--- Unknown ---
Give me freedom, freedom
It can all be rearranged
I need freedom, sweet freedom
And I know it might sound strange
I believe that I can change
--- Unknown ---
And when I look into the future
I can see another me, and I'm free
I've got an unfamiliar feelin' now
And it's slowin' over me
--- Unknown ---
Should I come clean?
What I really mean is
I think I need to make things right
Took some wrong turns
But I can still learn
If I try a new direction
I have a feeling I just might
--- Unknown ---
Find some freedom, freedom
If I could do it all again
I want freedom, sweet freedom
And I know it might sound strange
I believe that I can change
