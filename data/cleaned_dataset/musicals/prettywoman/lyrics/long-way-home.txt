------ Long Way Home ------
--- VIVIAN ---
Once, I dared to dream
And then the dream came true
And when it did
I wasn't sure what to do
--- EDWARD ---
When you find someone
Or when someone finds you
It’s then, you see,
It's always love that shines through
--- VIVIAN ---
'Cause I believed in you
And you believed in me
--- VIVIAN & EDWARD ---
And it’s a long way home
--- EDWARD ---
Still, I remember when
The way it used to be
--- VIVIAN & EDWARD ---
And it's a long way home
--- VIVIAN ---
And I'm alone
--- EDWARD ---
When I close my eyes
When the journey ends
There's a warm embrace,
The familiar face of a friend
'Cause I believed in you
--- VIVIAN ---
I believed in you
--- EDWARD ---
And you believed in me
--- VIVIAN ---
And you believed in me
--- EDWARD ---
And it's a
--- VIVIAN & EDWARD ---
Long way home
--- VIVIAN ---
And I remember when
--- EDWARD ---
I remember when
--- VIVIAN ---
The way it used to be
--- EDWARD ---
The way it used to be
--- VIVIAN ---
And it's a
--- VIVIAN & EDWARD ---
Long way home
--- EDWARD ---
And I'm alone
--- VIVIAN & EDWARD ---
There’s so much I miss
Oh, how I wish our lives could be
Extraordinary, extraordinary
Extraordinary, extraordinary
Extraordinary, extraordinary again
--- VIVIAN ---
’Cause
--- VIVIAN & EDWARD ---
I believed in you
--- ENSEMBLE ---
I believed in you
--- VIVIAN & EDWARD ---
And you believed in me
--- ENSEMBLE ---
And you believed in me
--- VIVIAN & EDWARD ---
And it's a
--- COMPANY ---
Long way home
--- VIVIAN ---
And
--- VIVIAN & EDWARD ---
I remember when
--- ENSEMBLE ---
I remember when
--- VIVIAN & EDWARD ---
The way it used to be
--- ENSEMBLE ---
The way it used to be
--- VIVIAN & EDWARD ---
And it's a
--- COMPANY ---
Long way home
--- VIVIAN & EDWARD ---
And I'm alone
--- EDWARD ---
Once, I dared to dream...
