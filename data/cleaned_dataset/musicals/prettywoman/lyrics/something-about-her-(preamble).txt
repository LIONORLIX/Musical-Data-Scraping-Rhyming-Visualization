------ Something About Her (Preamble) ------
--- EDWARD ---
What the hell just happened?
She took me for a ride
She beat me at my own game
She cut me down to size
So now we gotta know her
I'm not sure what to do
Haven't got a clue
--- Unknown ---
There's something about her
She's charming, there's no doubt
There's something about her
I don't know what it is
But I guess that I'll find out
--- HAPPY MAN ---
Maps to the stars
Can't get where you wanna be without a map
It's all written in the stars
So come along, I'll meet you there
I can take you anywhere
