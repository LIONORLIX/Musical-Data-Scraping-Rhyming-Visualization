------ Welcome to Our World (More Champagne) ------
--- ENSEMBLE ---
Champagne and sunshine, ponies and fine wine
Who wouldn't want to be us?
Never a tizzy, we're way too busy being fabulous
So bring on the bubbles, forget all your troubles
'Cause everything's going our way
Welcome to our world
Welcome to our world
The match is on, so come and join us
Welcome to our world, more champagne!

PHILIP STUCKEY: (spoken)
That's the end of the chukka!
Thank you all for your generous support to... whatever charity we dug up this month.
Couples are solo, we all love polo
The sport of kings and queens
Before we continue, we need your assistance
And you know what that means:
It's the age-old tradition, we'll be repositioned
The divots, don't force it
And don't step in the horse!

The match is on, so come and join us
