------ The Prince Of Humbug ------
--- Unknown ---
The Prince of Humbug.
Balderdash.
Fiddle, Faddle, Drivel, Posh
Twiddle, Twaddle, Blather, Bosh.
Bilge and dodge and double-dutch
And Flim-Flam I am!
--- Unknown ---
The King of Hogwash.
Tommyrot.
Jibber, Jabber, Blabber, Bluff
Hocus-Pocus, Gabble, Guff.
Scam and sham and just a touch
Of white lie am I.
--- Unknown ---
Duke of tripe and idle chat.
Earl of oil, Lord of flat.
Emperor of rigmarole.
That I am, Bless my soul.
--- Unknown ---
The Prince of Humbug.
Poppycock.
Piffle, waffle, panner junk
Hokum, Hooey, chatter, bunk.
Wile and guile and trumpery.
That's me.
--- Unknown ---
In a world of sting and shock
This moment we spend.
Down a road of ridge and rot
Toward Lord knows what end.
Through a night as dark as space and cold as the sea.
Someone's got to make it right.
Shoot a rocket, Shine a light.
Tell you who the someone's gonna be!
--- Unknown ---
The Prince of Humbug.
Tongue-in-cheek.
Shilly, Shally, pull the wool,
Blarney, bogus, cock and bull.
Hoax and prank and hanky-pank
And some skullduggery.
--- Unknown ---
I am! And damn, I'll always be!
