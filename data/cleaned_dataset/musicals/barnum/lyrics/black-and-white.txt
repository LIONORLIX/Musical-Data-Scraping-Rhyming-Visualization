Charity: May the 7th, 1851 (Chorus echo)
Day of days for Bridgeport?s favorite son (echo)
Likewise Swedish singing ladies
And the local clockworks he will run (Chorus echo)
Gone those wooly schemes that filled his head (Chorus echo)
Farewell Kelly green and cherry red (Chorus echo)
No more, step right up and see him
Barnum?s closed his last museum
And he?s gonna live his life instead (With Chorus)
--- Unknown ---
Singer: Black and white
The future?s rosy living black and white
Keep both feet on the ground
Don?t let those day dreams spin you round
See things the way they are
You?re gonna tumble if you fly too far
Stay low and hold on tight
Living black and white
--- Unknown ---
Charity: He could run the clockworks Barnum found
In two months he?d run it in the ground
Purchased then 500 shovels
Said men mustn?t live in huddles
And a new utopia I will found
Planned a very modern model town
Elevated roads to stroll around
Grew so high it made you groggy
Built on land a trifle soggy
So as it rose up it started down (echo: down down down down)
--- Unknown ---
Singer: Black and white
He built a city that was black and white
It took no end of spunk
And looked quite splendid as it sunk
Here comes another lurch
There goes the depot and the Baptist church
As they slipped out of sight
They were black and white
So long, ta ta goodnight
Bye bye black and white
Oh ooh oh oh ooh oh oh ooh oh oh
Oh yeah
--- Unknown ---
(Up tempo) Chorus: Heard about your city what a shame
But the truth is politics? your game
Kissing babies making speeches
Posing with the local beeches
Fun, respectability and fame
Charity: You could be an alder man, no wait (echo: no wait)
Congressman I mean U.S not state (echo: not state)
Mayor! Oh that?s easy pickin?s
Senator! Oh what the dickens (echo: senator)
Charity and Chorus: Why not hang a presidential slate
--- Unknown ---
Singer: Black and white
He?s playing politics in black and white
Cold truth and good hard facts
Give all that razzmatazz the axe
No bunting in the streets
You?ll talk of budget cuts and ballot sheets
Statistics day and night
Running black and white
--- Unknown ---
Barnum: Black and white
I?m runnin? politics in black and white
Cold truth and good hard facts
Give all that razzmatazz the axe
No bunting in the streets
I talk of budget cuts and ballot sheets
Statistics day and night?
(Spoken) Chairy, I?m losing ?em.
You gotta let me bring some colour into this campaign or they?ll beat me
--- Unknown ---
Charity (Spoken): Very well, Taylor. Go ahead!
--- Unknown ---
Chorus: Black and white
He?s had his fill of living black and white
So long ta ta good night
Bye bye bye bye black and
