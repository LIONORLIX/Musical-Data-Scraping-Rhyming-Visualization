------ One Brick At A Time ------
--- Chairy ---
The Lord gave each and everyone
The spunk to do what can't be done
The brawn, the brain, the courage and the heart
The strength to bend the strongest bar
The will to reach the farthest star
It's just a case of learning how to start.
To build a tower up so high to a cloud you'll anchor
Build it one tiny brick at a time
Bucks multiply till a bum's a banker
Just begin with a thin silver dime
That empty feild it can yeild miles and miles of flowers
You don't need no magic powers
Just a seed and showers
From the floor to the sky
You can soar if you're wise enough to climb
One brick at a time
--- Men ---
To build a ship that's built to last
--- Chairy ---
You lay the keel than raise the mast
--- Men ---
And ode begins with just a simple rhyme,
an oak with roots a mile beneath
--- Chairy ---
Becomes a stick to pick your teeth
--- Men ---
Just sharpen up your knide and take your time.
--- Chairy & chorus ---
One stalwart chap with a cup and bunch of hours he can scoop all the salt from the sea
Buds open up turning boughs to bowers
all begun by just one bumble bee.
To write with ease symphonies
or at least condati
filled with trills and obblifatti
start with fa sol la ti
leave the rest in the dust
be the best
if you're just content to climb,
one brick at a time.
--- Chairy ---
Just take a brick and place it on the ground
to make it stick pour mortar all around
--- Chairy & One girl ---
A cup of lime then stir it all it's hard
and up she'll climb by inch by foot by yard
--- Chairy & Girls ---
a still, a door, a ledge, a window pane
then drill some more raise up a weather vane
a roof the proof that go'in slow like this
--- Chairy ---
A splendid edifice can climb

A splendid edifice can climb
one brick at a
one brick at a time
one single solitary brick
one brick at a time
one single solitary brick
Ooooo ahhhhh
ooooo ahhhhh
oo oh whee oh
ahhhh
