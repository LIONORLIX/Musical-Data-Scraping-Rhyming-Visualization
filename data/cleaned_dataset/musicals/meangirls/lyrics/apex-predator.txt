------ Apex Predator ------
--- JANIS ---
Don’t be fooled by the pink
She is not playing dolls
She is stalking the halls
For the thrill of the kill
--- Unknown ---
Every person in school
Is aware of her stare
When she tosses her hair
They go perfectly still
--- Unknown ---
All their eyes say, “don’t attack me.”
Watch them sweat and pant and shake
Every food chain has its acme
Regina George eats steak
--- Unknown ---
She’s the queen of the beasts
She can smell your fear
In this biosphere
She’s the apex predator
--- Unknown ---
Like a lionesses
Only with less fur
Do not mess with her
She’s the apex predator
--- CADY ---
At the watering hole
See the girls who weren't nice
Have to scatter like mice
From a jungle cat
--- Unknown ---
And though Janis is great
She does not have this power
People literally cower
Janis can’t do that
--- Unknown ---
See us mark our territory
As I follow in her train
I was victim, I was quarry
Now I shake my mane
--- Unknown ---
She’s the queen of beasts
And I’m in her pride
I have hitched a ride
With the apex predator
--- Unknown ---
And it’s kinda fun
When she bares her claws
When I'm safe because
I'm with the apex predator
--- Unknown ---
Did I think I'd be protected by my new exotic pet
Not a chance if she suspected
I was any kind of reproductive threat
But she doesn't know yet
--- JANIS & CADY ---
No, she doesn't know yet
She's the queen of beasts
At this beastly school
Gotta keep things cool
With the apex predator
--- CADY ---
So I'm kinda friends
--- JANIS ---
But you're kind of prey
--- CADY ---
Jesus, what a day
--- JANIS & CADY ---
With the apex predator
Will she braid your hair
Will she eat your heart
How can you outsmart
The apex predator
