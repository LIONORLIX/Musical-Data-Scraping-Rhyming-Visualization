------ A Cautionary Tale ------
--- JANIS ---
It’s a cautionary tale of fear and lust, and pride
Based on actual events where people died
--- DAMIAN ---
No one died
But how far would you go
To be popular and hot?
Would you resist temptation?
--- JANIS ---
No, you would not!
Just admit it
--- BOTH ---
Sometimes being mean is what you are
Because is easier than nice
And though mean can take you far
Maybe this will make you think twice
--- JANIS ---
This is a cautionary tale
About corruption and betrayal!
--- DAMIAN ---
And getting hit by a bus!
--- JANIS ---
You can’t buy integrity at the mall and it’s not for sale
--- Unknown ---
DAMIAN (spoken): Nice
--- Unknown ---
JANIS (spoken): Thank you
--- BOTH ---
This is a cautionary tale
