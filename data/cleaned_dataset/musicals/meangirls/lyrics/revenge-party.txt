------ Revenge Party ------
--- Unknown ---
JANIS (spoken): No, don’t be sorry. Now you know Regina George is not your friend.
We are your friends. And we are gonna make her pay
--- JANIS ---
You know what friends do?
They’ve got your back
They’re fun to be around
--- DAMIAN ---
Whuh-oh. Whuh-oh. Whuh-oh
--- JANIS ---
When someone hurts you
Then they attack
And grind your foe into the ground
--- DAMIAN ---
Whuh-oh. Whuh-oh. Whuh-oh
--- JANIS ---
Imagine the party with dresses and cake
And singing and dancing and cake
And there’s a magic act
That saws Regina in half
And this time it will take
--- DAMIAN ---
Now that’s a party
--- JANIS ---
A revenge party
A party that ends
With somebody’s head on a spike
--- DAMIAN ---
Whuh-oh. Whuh-oh. Whuh-oh
--- JANIS & DAMIAN ---
It’s a Revenge Party with your two best friends
It’s like a party and revenge it’s what it’s like
--- Unknown ---
JANIS (spoken): I have dreamed of this day for many years,
But I have never had an inside man
--- Unknown ---
DAMIAN (spoken): Ugh, I almost did once as Governor of school, but I got nervous
--- Unknown ---
JANIS (spoken): Alright, if this is gonna work,
You are gonna have to pretend like you still like them, can you do it?
--- Unknown ---
CADY (spoken): Yes. (Gretchen enters) Hey, girl
--- Unknown ---
GRETCHEN (spoken): Hey. Regina wanted me to tell you that she tried to talk to Aaron,
But he just wanted her back and that’s not Regina’s fault
--- Unknown ---
CADY (spoken): No. I get it, I just hope I can still have lunch with you guys
--- Unknown ---
GRETCHEN (spoken): Aw, of course, also Regina wanted me to give you this
--- Unknown ---
DAMIAN (spoken): Ew
--- JANIS & DAMIAN ---
It’s a revenge party
A party that ends with eggshells all over the wall
It’s a revenge party with your two best friends
--- CADY ---
And I end up with Aaron when she’s gone
--- DAMIAN & JANIS ---
Yes, bitch!
--- CADY ---
I end up with Aaron when she’s gone
--- STUDENTS ---
What’s Regina doing?
What is Regina wearing?
Is she dating Aaron?
Regina, Regina she has everything
She gets everything
Regina, Regina, Regina
--- Unknown ---
JANIS (spoken): Now, we take away Regina’s only accomplishments,
Being a hot person
--- Unknown ---
DAMIAN (spoken): Yeah, but how?
--- Unknown ---
CADY (spoken): I know how!
--- Unknown ---
DAMIAN (spoken): Oh, here we go
--- Unknown ---
JANIS, DAMIAN, CADY: KÄLTEEN!
--- Unknown ---
REGINA (spoken): What is that?
--- Unknown ---
CADY (spoken): Ugh, I’m so fat and disgusting.
I just use these Kälteen diet bars when I need to lose weight
--- Unknown ---
REGINA (spoken): I want to lose three pounds. How many calories from fat?
--- Unknown ---
CADY (spoken): Zero. You just cross multiply x over a thousand
And divide it by point three five kilograms
--- Unknown ---
REGINA (spoken): Whatever! Bring me a whole box
--- JANIS & DAMIAN ---
It’s a revenge party
A party that ends with somebody crushed and alone
--- JANIS ---
And ugly crying
--- JANIS & DAMIAN ---
It’s a revenge party with your two best friends
It’s like a party and revenge is what is like
--- STUDENTS ---
What’s Regina eating?
God, look at her figure?
Did her boobs get bigger?
Regina, Regina, Regina, she has everything
She gets everything
Regina, Regina, Regina
--- Unknown ---
JANIS (spoken): We’ve got to go harder.
If we could get Gretchen Wieners to think that Regina is mad at her
--- Unknown ---
CADY (spoken): No. No, I can’t do that, Gretchen is fragile
--- Unknown ---
JANIS (spoken): Exactly, if we crack her she will spill something we could use.
Shh, here she comes
--- Unknown ---
CADY (spoken): Hey, girl, are you sending any candy canes?
--- Unknown ---
REGINA (spoken): I don’t send them, I just get them. Stop pulling it down,
Your hair looks sexy push back. Cady, please tell Aaron that his hair looks sexy push back
--- Unknown ---
CADY (spoken): Your hair looks sexy push back
--- Unknown ---
AARON (spoken): Um, thanks. I’ll see you in Cal
--- JANIS ---
At every party, there might be a low
Where the energy dips
--- DAMIAN ---
WHUH-OH. WHUH-OH. WHUH-OH
You might be thinking it’s late we should go
And they ran out of chips
--- CADY ---
No. No. No
I can’t even watch when she touches his hair
And I’ve watched a snake eat a cow
Regina needs to be taught
Sorry, Gretchen, I swear that I’m parting now
A candy cane, please
--- CADY, DAMIAN, JANIS ---
A revenge party!
A party that ends with lions in a roman arena
--- STUDENTS ---
She has everything
She gets everything
Regina, Regina, Regina
--- Unknown ---
DAMIAN (spoken): Ho, Ho, Ho. One candy cane gram for Shane Omen
--- STUDENTS ---
She gets everything
--- Unknown ---
DAMIAN (spoken): One for Caddy Heron
--- STUDENTS ---
She gets everything
--- Unknown ---
DAMIAN (spoken): Four for Glen Coco, you go Glen Coco
--- STUDENTS ---
Glen Coco. Glen Coco. Glen Coco
--- Unknown ---
DAMIAN (spoken): And none for Gretchen Wieners, bye
--- Unknown ---
GRETCHEN (spoken): Who sent that?
--- Unknown ---
CADY (spoken): Aw. It’s from…
--- STUDENTS ---
Regina! Regina! Regina!
--- Unknown ---
CADY (spoken): Thanks for being a such a great best friend
--- Unknown ---
GRETCHEN (spoken): Caulk! Caulk! Caulk! I mean cute. Gimme it. I mean… okay, well,
If you and Regina are best friends now you can be in charge of keeping all her secrets.
For example, she bought you those high heel shoes just
To make fun of you ‘cause she knew you wouldn’t be able to walk in them.
And she’s not really blonde, her natural color is dark blond,
Also she told me she cheats on Aaron every Thursday she says she has SAT Prep but really,
She’s hooking up with Shane Oman in the North Shore Lion’s Costume
--- Unknown ---
CADY (spoken): She makes him wear the costume?
--- Unknown ---
GRETCHEN (spoken): NO, THEY’RE BOTH IN THE COSTUME!
And I’ve never told anybody because I’m such a good friend
--- JANIS, CADY, DAMIAN ---
