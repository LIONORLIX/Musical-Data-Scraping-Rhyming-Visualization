------ What’s Wrong with Me? ------
--- GRETCHEN ---
(spoken) Regina, let me in. I'm sorry about the car burp
Tell me what's wrong with me
My body, face, my hair
Tell me all my many faults
Tell me like you care
--- Unknown ---
When we both know you're cruel
And we both know you're right
I could listen to you, like a fool all night
--- Unknown ---
What's wrong with me?
How I speak?
How I dress?
What's wrong with me?
--- Unknown ---
You keep me guessing
Mama called me beautiful
Don’t believe her anymore
Now I'm listening to you
--- Unknown ---
What do I do that for?
Please don't ignore me
Mmh. Mmh
--- Unknown ---
Tell me who we hate today
And I will fall in line
Hug me though my shoulders tense
And we’ll pretend we’re fine
--- Unknown ---
Though we both know one day
There’ll be blood on the floor
And which one will betray the other more
--- Unknown ---
CADY: (spoken) I have to go home now
--- GRETCHEN ---
(spoken) Okay. Fun. See you tomorrow!
What’s wrong with me?
Where’s my mind
Where does it end?
Maybe I need to try to get other friends
--- Unknown ---
What’s wrong with you
What can I do
What’s wrong with me
Could it be you
--- Unknown ---
What’s wrong with me
See that, you see
What’s wrong with me
Mmh. Mmh
