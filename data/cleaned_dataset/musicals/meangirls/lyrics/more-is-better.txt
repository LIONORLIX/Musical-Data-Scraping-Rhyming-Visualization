------ More Is Better ------
--- CADY ---
I was alone a lot
Mostly observing things
Like hyenas and migrations
And who cares?
--- Unknown ---
Now I have all these friends
I'm never by myself
I mean, look at all those people downstairs
More is always better
--- Unknown ---
More people know my name
I have more shoes
More is always better
Cause when you have less
You have more to lose
--- Unknown ---
Wait, that’s confusing
--- AARON ---
See, I don't mind alone
Sometimes alone is good
‘Cause time to think is in short supply
--- CADY ---
You haven't been alone
Try Kenya with one phone
Almost no people
Just like animals and sky
--- Unknown ---
Do you know what I had more of?
Stars
So many stars at night
But here there's so much light
I see them less now
--- Unknown ---
Plus, I'm always cold because the air-conditioned air
Though in fairness, that could be how I dress now
Whatever, I look cuter
It worked, like pretending I needed a tutor
--- Unknown ---
AARON: (spoken)
Pretending?
--- Unknown ---
CADY: (spoken)
Yeah, I pretended to be bad at math to get you to talk to me
--- Unknown ---
AARON: (spoken)
Why didn’t you just talk to me?
--- Unknown ---
CADY: (spoken)
Because of Regina. Because you were her property…
--- Unknown ---
AARON: (spoken)
Her property?
--- Unknown ---
CADY: (spoken)
No, shut up, not her property…
--- Unknown ---
AARON, spoken]
Don’t tell me to shut up
You are, like, a clone of Regina
--- Unknown ---
CADY: (spoken)
What? No!
--- Unknown ---
(singing)
I am more, I am better
And no one likes you more
Not anyone, not her
--- Unknown ---
More is always better
Don't look at me that way
What girl would you prefer?
--- AARON ---
I would prefer the girl you were
Not who you're trying to be
You think this works with me?
Well, you thought wrong
--- Unknown ---
Looking at this place
I see you trying to erase
What is best about yourself just to belong
--- Unknown ---
You say more is always better
But there is less of you than there was before
So, if more is always better
Then you should have thought it through a bit more
--- CADY ---
I should have thought it through a bit…
You know what I had more of?
Stars…
