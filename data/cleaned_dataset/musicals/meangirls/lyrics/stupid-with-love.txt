------ Stupid With Love ------
--- CADY ---
When I was five I fell in love
It didn't last
He ran from me
Literally ran from me
And being Kenyan
He ran fast
--- Unknown ---
AARON (spoken): Mrs. Norbury is tough and a little weird but you get to like her eventually
--- Unknown ---
CADY (spoken): Oh, like snake meat
--- CADY ---
When I was ten in love again
This doctor from France
I waited for hours
Inside his candy flower
But was attacked by fire ants
--- Unknown ---
By thirteen I gave up trying
I decided I would be a mathematician
'Cause math is real
I memorized a lot of pi
Because additions and subtractions and division
Would never make me feel
So stupid with love
--- Unknown ---
Like I didn't get it
I didn't get it somehow
Smart at math and stupid with love
I didn't get it
I didn’t get it
'Till now
--- Unknown ---
AARON (spoken): Do you have an eraser?
--- Unknown ---
CADY (spoken): I would love to
--- CADY ---
So, thank you math for being there
To bring me joy
And thank you math
'Cause now brought me this cute boy
--- Unknown ---
AARON (spoken): Is it two?
--- Unknown ---
CADY (spoken): YES! Wee
--- CADY ---
He's like someone from T.V. he's like that guy who give out roses to those women
His clothes is grooming
And he's not that far away from me with silky hair and shiny eyes that I could swim in,
He's livening the room
--- Unknown ---
And I'm stupid with love
I wanna get it I want to get it, but how?
Smart with math, but stupid with love
I wanna get it I didn't get it 'till now
--- Unknown ---
CADY (spoken)
Two over zero is undefined
--- Unknown ---
AARON (spoken)
Two over zero is undefined Jinx.
--- Unknown ---
CADY (spoken)
Ha!
--- CADY ---
I'm astounded and nonplussed
I am filled with calculust
Does this guy work out?
He must get all sweaty at the gym
--- Unknown ---
Could that image be more hot?
Let me just enjoy that thought
School was tough but now it’s not
'Cause now there’s him. It’s all so simple
--- Unknown ---
Stupid with love but I can get it
Watch this girl self-educate
I learned math so I can learn love
--- Unknown ---
You wanna bet it
That I can get it
Just wait
Just wait
Just wait
