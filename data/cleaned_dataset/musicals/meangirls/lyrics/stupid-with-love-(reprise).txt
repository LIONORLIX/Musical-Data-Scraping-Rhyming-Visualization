With her I tried to be somebody cool
--- Unknown ---
CADY: (spoken)
You’re already cool
--- Unknown ---
AARON: (spoken)
Um. Thanks
(sung) That’s love, I guess
You try hard to impress but end up acting like a tool
I find the whole thing so frustrating
--- CADY ---
Sounds frustrating

--- CADY ---
I’ll never get it
--- Unknown ---
AARON: (spoken)
You’ll never get what?

CADY: (spoken)
What? Umm. Eee. This problem

AARON: (spoken)
It’s a factorial, you multiply it
--- Unknown ---
CADY: (spoken)
Ooh, thanks. You’re so smart

Okay, don't sleep on that. She just pretended to be dumb to get a boy to keep talking to her.
And it worked. 'Cause that shit always works

CADY: (spoken)
Grool. I meant to say “great” and then I started to say “cool”
--- Unknown ---
AARON: (spoken)

Stupid with love
But now I get it
Both we finally found a way
Acting dumb times x equals love
--- Unknown ---
