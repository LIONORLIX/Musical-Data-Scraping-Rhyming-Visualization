------ I'd Rather Be Me ------
--- JANIS ---
So your best friend screwed you over
Acted nice when she’s not nice
Well, I have some advice
‘Cause it’s happened to me. Twice
Here’s my secret strategy,
It always works because
The world doesn’t end
It just feels like it does
--- Unknown ---
So raise your right finger
And solemnly swear
Whatever they say about me
I don’t care!
--- Unknown ---
I won’t twist in knots to join your game
I will say, you make me mad.
And if you treat me bad
I’ll say “you’re bad”
And if I eat alone from this moment on
That’s just what I’ll do
‘Cause I’d rather be me, I’d rather be me
I’d rather be me than be with you
--- Unknown ---
We’re supposed to all be ladies
And be nurturing and care
Is that really fair?
Boys get to fight, we have to share
Here’s the way that turns out
We always understand
How to slap someone down
With our underhands
--- Unknown ---
So here’s my right finger
To how girls should behave
'Cause sometimes what’s meant to break you
Makes you brave
--- Unknown ---
So I will not act all innocent
I won’t fake apologize
Let’s just fight and then make up, not tell these lies
Let’s call our damage even
Clean the slate till it's like new
It’s a new life for me
Where I’d rather be me
I’d rather be me than be with you
--- JANIS ---
I'll say, NO!
--- FEMALE STUDENTS ---
NO!
--- JANIS ---
I’ll say, knock it off, with your notes and your rules and your games.
And those sycophants who follow you
I’ll remember all their names
And when they drag you down
Like they inevitably do
I will not laugh along with them
And approve their palace coup, ‘cause that’s not me
--- FEMALE STUDENTS ---
Janis. Janis. Janis. Janis
--- JANIS ---
I don’t need their good opinions
I have plenty of opinions
Everybody has opinions but it doesn’t make them true
What’s true is being me
And I’d rather be me
I’d rather be me than be with you.
--- FEMALE STUDENTS ---
And I’d rather be me
I’d rather be me than be with you.
--- JANIS ---
So raise them high ‘cause playing nice and shy is insulting my IQ
--- FEMALE STUDENTS ---
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah
--- JANIS ---
I'd Rather Be Me
I'd Rather Be Me
I'd Rather Be Me than be with you!
I'd Rather Be Me
I'd Rather Be Me
I'd Rather Be Me than be with you!
