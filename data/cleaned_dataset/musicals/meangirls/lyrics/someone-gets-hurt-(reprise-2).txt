CADY: (spoken)
Janis, I can’t spend every second with you,
It’s not my fault that you’re like in love with me or something
--- Unknown ---
DAMIAN: (spoken)
Oh, no, she didn’t
--- Unknown ---
JANIS: (spoken)
See? That is the thing with you Plastics.
You think that everyone is in love with you when actually everyone hates you
--- Unknown ---
CADY: (spoken)
You made me like this it was your idea for me to pretend to be Plastic
--- Unknown ---
JANIS: (spoken)
No that’s…
Buddy, it’s not pretend
You’re as plastic as they come
You think your shit don't stink
You think the rest of us are dumb
--- Unknown ---
I hate Regina’s guts
But here’s what you can’t comprehend
At least she has the guts to not pretend
To be my friend…
Here have it, it won a prize

CADY: (spoken)
Janis. I…
--- JANIS ---
No. It’s fine
Really fine
We’ll be fine
--- DAMIAN ---
And I want my pink shirt
