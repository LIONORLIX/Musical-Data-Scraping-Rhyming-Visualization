Whose house is this?

--- KEVIN ---
Seriously, whose house is this?
Hear about a party
Here's the procedure
Text all your friends
Tell 'em where to meet you
--- Unknown ---
So you know nobody
That's not what counts
It's someone's house
And they got no bouncer!
--- Unknown ---
Tons of marijuana
And molly and the conahan
Drinking from the neck
Of the bottle, what the heck
--- Unknown ---
We lit up like a torch
Smokin' on your porch
Tryin'a maintain
While the neighbors complain
--- PARTYGOERS ---

Really, this is not-
Really, that's a lot-
Really, is that pot?
--- GRETCHEN ---
Cady, do a shot!
--- PARTYGOERS ---
Shot! Shot! Shot! Shot!
Shot! Shot! Shot! Wooh!
--- CADY ---
Oh wow, that's really strong and
Why's Aaron taking so long and
Put that down!
That's not a bong!
--- KEVIN ---
Spinnin' on the stereo
Of somebody I barely know
Hey, Cady Heron!
Music's blarin'!
--- CADY ---
You seen Aaron?
--- GRETCHEN ---
No!
--- KEVIN ---
Senior jocks and band freaks
Throwin' all of your antiques
Drinkin' till we slur
Hence, hope you got insurance!

It will pass into legend
Music is cranked
Everyone's tanked
Say, Thank you, Gretchen!
--- CADY ---
Really everyone?
--- PARTYGOERS ---
Hey!
