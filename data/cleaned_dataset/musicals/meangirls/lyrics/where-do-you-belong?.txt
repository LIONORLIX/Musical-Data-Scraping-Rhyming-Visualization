My momma used to tell me:
“baby girl don’t ever eat lunch on the john.”
--- Unknown ---
JANIS (spoken): Your mother called you “baby girl”?
--- DAMIAN ---
(spoken) Singing, ha ha
(sung) If the other ducklings think you’re ugly
It’s because they’ve never seen a swan
It takes all kinds of people who need people
So find people you can bare
--- Unknown ---
Go find your group, your herd, your flock
Come talk a walk and answer my small questionnaire
Which I’ll sing to you…
Ahh. Ahhh
--- Unknown ---
Where do you belong?
Where do you belong?
Where do you belong?
Where do you belong?
--- Unknown ---
You’ll be judged on sight
And made to fit
So find a clique and stick with it
Say, where do you belong?
--- Unknown ---
(spoken): Let’s take a walk in the cafeteria, shall we? I’ll show you the world as I see it
--- Unknown ---
Varsity jocks and jv jocks
Will throw you in a locker if you say “Hello.”
The rich stoners hate the gangsta whites
Though they're all smokin' the same oregano
--- Unknown ---
Here’s the sexually active band geeks
I’ve got two words for you:
“embouchure” and “ew”
And if you like blowing and fingering
--- Unknown ---
Sexually active band geeks
This is the group of you!
--- DAMIAN ---
(spoken) Back me up, show choir!
(sung) Cady, where do you belong
Where do you belong
--- STUDENTS ---
We’re dying to tell ya!
--- DAMIAN ---
We all get a box that’s where we go
It’s stifling but at least you know
So, where do you belong?
--- STUDENTS ---
We’re dying to tell ya!
We’re dying to
We’re dying to
We’re dying to!
--- DAMIAN ---
There’s girls that eat their feelings
And girls who don’t eat
I like eating birthday cake around them
(spoken) Makes them crazy
Debate team
--- STUDENTS ---
And dance team
They like to compete
--- DAMIAN ---
And if they don’t win
Their parents ground them
--- Unknown ---
CADY (spoken): Who’s this?
--- DAMIAN ---
Darling those are the mathletes
--- Unknown ---
CADY (spoken): Cool!
--- DAMIAN ---
Joining them is social suicide
--- DAMIAN & STUDENTS ---
It’s all college applications
And doctor who quotations
--- DAMIAN ---
They wear their awkwardness with stubborn pride
(spoken) This is my dance break
--- STUDENTS ---
Where do you belong
Where do you belong
Where do you belong
Where do you belong
--- DAMIAN ---
You’ll be judged on site, voted in or out
‘cause that’s what high school’s all about
--- STUDENTS ---
Where do you belong?
--- Unknown ---
CADY (spoken): Oh, a kenya jacket! Jambo, rafiki!
--- Unknown ---
RACHEL HAMILTON: What did you call me?
--- Unknown ---
DAMIAN (spoken): Nope. Those are the woke seniors. Hey, rachel! You look cute.
I liked your post about intersectional veganism. See? Nothing.
She can tell we’re idiots
(sung) But, who is at this table? Why it’s janis!
--- Unknown ---
JANIS: And damian, too!
--- Unknown ---
STUDENTS: Ooo
--- JANIS & DAMIAN ---
We’re not exactly joiners
But, we’ll be good friends to you
And our friendship means you can skip
--- Unknown ---
JANIS: The geeks and the freaks, and the peaking too soon
--- DAMIAN ---
The strivers, and the survivors, just waiting for june
The junior achievers
--- Unknown ---
JANIS: The christian believers
--- Unknown ---

And shall with us
Come to lunch
And sit with us!
