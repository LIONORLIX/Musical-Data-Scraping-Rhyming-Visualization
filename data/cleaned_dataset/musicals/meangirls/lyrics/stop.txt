Ironically, I need to scare you straight
Because this should not be how we roll
We get these ideas and we just can't wait
But there is a price
--- Unknown ---
You want to do slash have it all
Because you have no impulse control
So before you snap, tag, like, or god forbid call
Here is my advice
Stop
--- Unknown ---
When you send five texts
And you get none back
So you want to send a sixth one
Stop
You gotta stop
--- Unknown ---
Stop
When you’re failing math
‘Cause you think it’s more attractive
To guys if you’re stupid
Stop
--- Unknown ---
Do better and stop
I know it’s hard but try
Don’t instantly gratify
My god, girl, he’s just a guy
You really need to stop
--- Unknown ---
Stop
You’re gonna make a mess
And then who’s going to get the mop?
--- Unknown ---
JANIS: (spoken)
This guy!
--- DAMIAN ---
When you talk
And you talk ‘til you can’t get calm
It keeps coming out like
Word vomit. Stop!
Eat a cracker and stop
--- Unknown ---
JANIS: (spoken)
Cady, we all make bad choices, sometimes. Damian, tell her about Phillip

Oh, at art camp, I played Lumiere
And the Beast and I had a fling
I’d run my fingers through his hair
Well, beast. So, fur

His second show was Anything Goes
And his co-star was some female thing
And when they kissed
Which by the way, gross
I wanted to murder her
--- Unknown ---
But no one told me stop stalking him
And that pasty catholic girl
Who is playing Hope Harcourt
Of course, cause, basic
Stop
--- CHRISTIAN, MARWAN & SHANE ---
STOP! STOP! STOP!
--- DAMIAN ---
I couldn’t stop
--- CHRISTIAN, MARWAN & SHANE ---
Dude, you really need to stop
--- DAMIAN ---
Stop
Posting comments on Youtube
As four different people
That her De-Lovely was pitchy
Stop
--- CHRISTIAN, MARWAN & SHANE ---
STOP! STOP! STOP!
--- DAMIAN ---
I really had to stop
--- CHRISTIAN, MARWAN & SHANE ---
He didn’t stop
--- DAMIAN ---
‘Cause when you feel attacked
That’s a feeling, not a fact
Don’t jump online and react
You really need to stop
Stop
Picking at…
--- DAMIAN, CHRISTIAN, MARWAN & SHANE ---
The emotional zit
That you can’t pop
--- DAMIAN ---
For four whole weeks
I trolled and dissed her
Then I found out
She was his sister! Stop!
Hashtag obsessed, stop
--- CHRISTIAN, MARWAN & SHANE ---
STOP!

And now he won’t talk to me, and he won’t accept my edible arrangements.
Ladies, what have you learned from your worst ideas?
--- TAYLOR WEDELL ---
Oh! Stop
When you think to yourself
Should I get a tattoo
Of the Chinese word for wisdom?
Stop
Check the spelling and stop!
It means bucket
--- CAITLYN CAUSSIN ---
Stop
When you’re babysitting kids
And you make them go to bed
So you can take their mom’s oxy
Stop
Stick to vodka and stop
--- KAREN ---
Stop
When you have a huge crush on a boy
And he asks you to send nude pics
And you’re like “Wow, he likes me”
So you send them
But don’t crop your head off
‘Cause you’re only thirteen
And don’t know any better
And I guess his friends shared them
‘Cause now you’re all over
A porn site called “Amateur Tweens”
--- Unknown ---
Stop!
‘Cause I’m actually a human being a not a prop
--- DAMIAN & GIRLS ---
Think before posting…
--- KAREN ---
Sending…

Tattooing!

Good work, ladies, let’s take a break. A-five-six-seven-eight!
--- DAMIAN & GIRLS ---
Stop
Stop
--- CADY ---
Jesus
--- DAMIAN & GIRLS ---
As right as it might seem
To overshare, troll or meme
That’s just low self esteem
In your brain like a bull in a china shop
--- DAMIAN ---
Stop
Being glued to your phone
Counting followers and likes and ignoring your friends
--- Unknown ---
DAMIAN: (spoken)
She’s leaving just like my dad
--- DAMIAN & GIRLS ---

Stop, stop, stop
We can’t stop
Stop, stop, stop
