(spoken) Hi
(sung) If I could change the world
I’d make it halloween
Every single day
And also have world peace should be first
World peace and then halloween
(spoken) Wait, let me start over
--- Unknown ---
(sung) If I could change the world
I’d make us have world peace
And also halloween
Every single day
On halloween, you can pretend to be someone else
It’s like the internet
Only in person and with candy
When you are the hot one
It’s a full time gig
Looking like what people wanna see
--- Unknown ---
GIRLS: Woah-oh. Woah-oh-oh
KAREN & GIRLS: I can be
KAREN: Who I wanna be and s*xy
--- KAREN & GIRLS ---
I can be
Who I wanna be and hot
Don’t like who you are
Then hit that costume shop
Rock a new and different s*xy look
--- Unknown ---
GIRLS: Woah-oh. Woah-oh-oh
KAREN: (spoken)
Why be so down hearted
And blast some trashy pop
And drop it to this hot and s*xy look
--- Unknown ---
KAREN & GIRLS: I can be
KAREN: Who I wanna be and s*xy
KAREN & GIRLS: I can be
KAREN: Who I wanna be and hot
KAREN & GIRLS: Be somebody new
Do a total transformation!
--- KAREN ---
Animals, or men will do
Or even vegetation!
(spoken) I give you “s*xy corn!”
(sung) I can be, who i want to be
--- Unknown ---
KAREN & GIRLS: S*xy!
KAREN: A s*xy quint from s*xy “jaws,” catching s*xy sharks
GIRLS: Uh-huh!
KAREN: S*xy eleanor roosevelt or s*xy rosa parks!
GIRLS: Uh-huh!
--- KAREN ---
I can be a s*xy pirate
Or a s*xy ballet dancer
I can be a s*xy doctor
And cure some s*xy cancer!
(spoken) That’s not right, is it?
--- Unknown ---
GRETCHEN: No
KAREN: I can s*xy cure some cancer!
GRETCHEN: No!
KAREN: I can cure s*x cancer!
GRETCHEN: (spoken) S*x cancer doesn’t exist
KAREN: (spoken) I did it
GIRLS: Happy halloween!
--- KAREN ---
This is modern feminism talking
I expect to run the world in shoes I cannot walk in
I can be, who I want to be
And s*x…
S*x…
S*xy!
(spoken) I’m a s*xy mouse
