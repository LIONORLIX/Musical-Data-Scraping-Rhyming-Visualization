------ We're Goin' In ------
--- FBI ---
--- Unknown ---
We're goin' in
We're goin' in
We'll ring the bell and
Arrest this felon
We're goin' in!
--- Unknown ---
We're goin' in
We're goin' in
With decoy flowers
We'll catch this coward,
We're goin' in
--- Unknown ---
And everything'll turn out fine
We got here in the nick of time
We'll take him out
That's the job
Save the girl
Hey no problem!
--- Unknown ---
We're goin' in
We're goin' in
His home's surrounded
He's going down, cause
We're goin' in!

FBI!
--- Silence ---
--- FBI ---
--- Unknown ---
There's no one here
There's no one here
Big splashy entry
This house is empty
There's no one here!
--- Clarice ---
--- Unknown ---
I'm Agent Staring, FBI
Have you see this girl?
--- Buffalo Bill ---
--- Unknown ---
No, uh-uh. Why?
--- Clarice ---
--- Unknown ---
This guy is weird
I don't trust him
Hope I've got the guts to bust him.
I'll bet he's kidnapped Catherine
--- Bill ---
--- Unknown ---
Was she a great big fat person?
Could this girl be
Any dumber?
Time is up
I've got her number!
--- Chorus ---
--- Unknown ---
There's no one here
There's no one here
We got it wrong and
Clarice is next
So we better move it along
We'd better finish this song
There's no one here
