Great if so
Don't you lie or else I'll know.

Should I let
Him inside?
Oh my God I'm terrified

If I don't
Catherine dies

Daddy died
I was young
--- Lecter ---
Was he shot? That sounds like fun.
--- Clarice ---
Don't get cute
Else we're done.
--- Lecter ---
I can make you eat your tongue.
--- Clarice ---
Moved away to live on my uncle's ranch.
--- Lecter ---
Did your uncle ever remove your underpants?
--- Clarice ---
Heard a scream one night and I ran downstairs.
--- Lecter ---
Did your uncle ever molest your pubic hair?
--- Clarice ---
Saw them kill
Lots of sheep.
--- Lecter ---
Did your uncle rape you?
--- Clarice ---
No, you creep.
Quid pro quo
Your turn now
Gotta catch him
Tell me how.
--- Clarice ---
You control
Catherine's fate.
--- Lecter ---
All good things to those who wait.
--- Clarice ---
Gotta know
Who he is.
--- Lecter ---
You've been good I'll grant your wish.
--- Clarice ---
Stole a heavy lamb and I ran away.
--- Lecter ---
Louis Friend is Buffalo Bill's real name.
--- Clarice ---
They caught me, took my lamb and they killed her too.
--- Lecter ---
Height five ten and eyes that are pale and blue.
You still hear those poor lambs scream
Every night they haunt your dreams.
--- Clarice ---

--- Lecter ---
Big fat Catherine is your sheep
Save her get a good night's sleep!

--- Clarice ---
Time is short.
--- Lecter ---
Are your panties wet?

Solve the case.
--- Clarice ---
Don't have much more time to waste.
--- Lecter ---
Use your head
You're too slow.
--- Clarice ---
Who is he? I've got to know.

Sodomy, felatio...
