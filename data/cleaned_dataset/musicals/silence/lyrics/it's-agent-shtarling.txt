------ It's Agent Shtarling ------
--- Agent Starling ---
Who would have thought,
I could make it this far,
In so little time?
--- Unknown ---
Look in the car,
There's a head in a jar,
It's the scene of a crime!
--- Unknown ---
Now they can't hold me back,
'Cause I just raised the bar,
I'm on fire, call the press,
Here I am, hold your breath,
I'm a star!
--- Unknown ---
It's Agent Shtarling!
--- Unknown ---
Riddles and anagrams,
Oh how he thrives,
On his cute little games,
--- Unknown ---
Don't really mind,
At the end of the day,
If he's giving me names
--- Unknown ---
And now that I'm making a difference,
The guys won't belittle me back at the base,
Guess it's a good thing that Multiple Miggs,
Shot a load in my face
--- Unknown ---
Crawford's rewarding me,
Now I'm officially,
Part of the chase
--- Unknown ---
All of you bastards,
You'd better keep up,
'Cause I'm setting the pace
--- Unknown ---
I'm excited I confess,
Won't my teachers be impressed?
I'll be Quantico's little darling
--- Unknown ---
There are lives on the line,
And that severed head's a sign,
That this case should be mine!
--- Unknown ---
It's Agent Shtarling!
--- Officer 1 ---
Whenever you're ready, Starling
--- Agent Starling ---
This girl, she wasn't local,
Her ears are pierced three times,
She's purple and she's bloated,
Body's caked in grime.
--- Unknown ---
Diamond shaped incisions,
In the middle of her back,
Lot's of missing tissue,
And her fingernails cracked.
--- Unknown ---
When they found her,
She was lying afloat,
She's the specimen,
I'm taking notes.
--- Unknown ---
Though it might be,
Inappropriate to gloat,
Don't look now,
But I just found a bug in her throat!
--- Officer 2 ---
What kind of maniac would shove a moth down someone's throat?
--- Agent Starling ---
I don't know... But I know who does.
Lord only knows,
What he's thinking behind,
That maniacal stare
--- Unknown ---
He's an expert on perfume,
Accessories, clothes,
Better watch what I wear
--- Unknown ---
He's cooperated great,
Information on a plate,
All the clues are on a slate,
Because I'm starving
--- Unknown ---
Now there's no turning back,
He and I, We're on park,
Let him put me on the track,
No more nonsense, just the facts,
------ fin ------
