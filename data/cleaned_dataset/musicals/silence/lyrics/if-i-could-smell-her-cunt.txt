------ If I Could Smell Her Cunt ------
--- Lecter ---
Now.
What did Miggs say to you?
Multiple Miggs in the next cell, he
Hissed at you.
What did he say?
--- Clarice ---
He said,
'I can smell your cunt.'
--- Lecter ---
I see.
I myself cannot.
--- Unknown ---
(sung)
If I could smell her cunt
She'd help me taste humanity again
And if I promise not to eat her
Then perhaps she'd even be my friend
If I could smell her cunt
If I could smell her cunt.
--- Unknown ---
If I could undo who I am
I'd snap my fingers: brand new man!
I want to smell her bearded clam
I almost can!
Trapped behind this pane of glass
A man who reeks of taste of class
I'm sitting on my bony ass
And now this wo-man:
--- Unknown ---
I'd like to tell her I don't care
But something in her eyes...
I'd like to tell her life's not fair
The smell between her thighs.
--- Unknown ---
Lonely lonely lunatic
I want to know what makes her tick
If only she would let me pick
Her pretty brain.
I want a new relationship
The kind that challenges my wit
The kind that doesn't leave behind
A bloody stain...
--- Unknown ---
If I could smell her cunt
She'd help me find
The man I used to be
And if I promise not to serve her as an entree
She'd be friends with me
If I could smell her cunt
If I could smell her cunt.
--- Unknown ---
If I could help her solve this case
Perhaps they'd let me leave this place
For one that has a bit more space
I want to see a tree!
Lonely lonely lunatic
I'm charming but I'm also sick
I need an audience for my schtick
Perhaps it could be she!
--- Unknown ---
If I could do it all again
I wouldn't harm a fly
Erase the gruesome things I've done
And smell her cherry pie.
--- Unknown ---
If I could smell her cunt
If she would grant my simple little wish
I could reclaim my grasp on sanity
I bet she smells like tuna fish
If I could smell her cunt
If I could smell her cunt.
--- Unknown ---
Am I crazy? I can't tell
Eight years rotting in this cell
Feels a lot like I'm in hell
If only I could smell her cunt
