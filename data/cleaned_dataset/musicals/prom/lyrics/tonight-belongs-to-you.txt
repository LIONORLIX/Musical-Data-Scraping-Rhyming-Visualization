------ Tonight Belongs to You ------
--- BARRY ---
I can tell you're feeling wary
But you can count on uncle Barry
He can turn this butch-y duck into a swan
Your whole look could use a shake-up
You can borrow all my make-up
And the pair of spanks I currently have on
--- EMMA (spoken) ---
I think I'll pass
--- BARRY ---
Treat the whole world like your runway
Make it fierce but in a fun way
Try to flip your hair like Cher
And drag queens do
And I don't mean to be rude, dear
But you could use some attitude, dear
--- Unknown ---
Let's show the school that
Tonight belongs to you
--- Unknown ---
One thing's universal
Live's no dress rehearsal
So why not make some waves before it's through
Go big or you've blown it
It's time that you own it
Let's make it clear that
Tonight belongs to you
--- Unknown ---
(spoken)
Now, whatever we choose, you gotta remember to sell it
--- EMMA (spoken) ---
How do I do that?
--- BARRY (spoken) ---
Allow Miss Glickman to demonstrate
--- Unknown ---
(sung)
You might find this disconcerting
But old Barry's done some flirting
Try to bat your eyes and smize
Each time you grin
--- EMMA ---
I can guess your whole agenda
--- BARRY ---
You be Elphie
I'm Glinda
--- BOTH ---
It's makeover time so why not just give in
--- BARRY ---
Come on
--- BOTH ---
One thing's universal
Live's no dress rehearsal
So why not make some waves before it's through
Go big or you've blown it
--- EMMA ---
It's time that I own it
--- BARRY ---
Yes ma'am!
--- BOTH ---
Let's make it clear that
Tonight belongs to you
--- BARRY (spoken) ---
What?
--- EMMA ---
Belongs to me
--- SHELBY ---
Oh god, I can't believe this is finally happening
--- KAYLEE ---
She almost ruined it for all of us
--- SHELBY ---
Well, what goes around comes around. You look hot
--- KAYLEE ---
You look so hot
--- BOTH ---
Well I hate to sound conceited
But the boys get overheated
When I strike a pose or two like this
--- KAYLEE ---
You have to hand it to me
I mean even I would do me
--- BOTH ---
Let's show the world
Tonight belongs to us
One thing's universal
Live's no dress rehearsal
Excuse me while I state the obvious
--- Unknown ---
Go big or you've blown it
It's time that we own it
Let's make it clear that
Tonight belongs to us
--- MRS. GREENE (spoken) ---
I have worked very hard on this night and I have a right to enjoy it, too.
Now you are going to have a wonderful prom.
Like a normal girl. I made sure of that
--- ALYSSA (spoken) ---
What does that mean?
--- MRS. GREENE ---
I don't like when strangers get in my way
Or anyone who messes with the PTA
Well maybe that's just me
But trust me
Fixing little problems is what I do
Now everyone is happy
I promise you
And I would never miss a night like this, Alyssa
You're my superstar
Now get your ass in the car
--- ENSEMBLE ---
Tonight belongs to us
Tonight belongs to us
--- Unknown ---
One thing's universal
Live's no dress rehearsal
Excuse me while I state the obvious
--- Unknown ---
Go big or you've blown it
It's time that we own it
Let's make it clear that
Tonight belongs to
Make it clear that tonight belongs to
Make it clear that tonight belongs to us
