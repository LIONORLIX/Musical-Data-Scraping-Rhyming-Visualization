EMMA (sung)
Note to self
Don't be gay in Indiana
Big heads up,
That's a really stupid plan
There are places where it's in to be out
Maybe San Francisco or there about
But in Indiana, without a doubt,
If you're not straight,
then guess what's bound to hit the fan
--- Unknown ---
Just breathe, Emma
Not everyone is that repressed
Just breathe, Emma
It wouldn't be high school without a test
Just close your eyes and count to ten
Go to your happy place, and then
Try not to combust
Just breathe

BOY 1 (spoken)
Hey, Emma! So, who is this girl you were gonna bring to the prom, anyway?
Like, I didn't know we had more than one lesbo in town.
--- Unknown ---
EMMA (spoken)
You don't know her. She's new here.
--- Unknown ---
BOY 2 (spoken)
Like an exchange student?
--- Unknown ---
EMMA (spoken)
Maybe.
--- Unknown ---
BOY 1 (spoken)
Whoa! Then why don't you just, like, exchange her...for a guy?
--- Unknown ---
BOY 2 (spoken)
Dude, nice!

Note to self
People suck in Indiana
Leave today
Pray the Greyhound isn’t full
Who knew asking out a girl to the prom
Would go over just like an atom bomb
And make things much worse with your dad and mom
And who'd have ever thought
That could be possible
--- Unknown ---
Just breathe, Emma
Picture a beach with golden sand
Just breathe, Emma
Picture a Xanax in your hand
Try journaling
Or start a blog
Just end this inner monologue
--- Unknown ---
Seethe, if you must
But just breathe

MR. HAWKINS (spoken)
Okay, I just got off the phone with the states attorney.
Like I suspected she thinks this is a civil rights issue.
This is a big deal Emma.
--- Unknown ---
EMMA (spoken)
Oh shit…sorry
--- Unknown ---
MR. HAWKINS (spoken)
We’ll get through it. Take a sec, relax. Come in when you're ready.

EMMA(sung)
Just breathe, Emma
Remember that thing called oxygen
Just breathe, Emma
Look at the crazy state you’re in
Just smile and nod
Although they’re jerks
Say namaste and pray it works
--- Unknown ---
And like we’ve discussed
Just breathe
