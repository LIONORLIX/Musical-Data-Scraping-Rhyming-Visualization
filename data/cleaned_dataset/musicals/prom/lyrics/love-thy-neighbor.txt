------ Love Thy Neighbor ------
--- TRENT (spoken) ---
You can't cherry pick the bible, choosing which part you wanna believe
--- KAYLEE (spoken) ---
We don't do that
--- TRENT (spoken) ---
You don't? What's this?
--- Unknown ---
(sung)
Kaylee has a small tattoo
That tattoo would be taboo
Kaylee guess what waits for you
An eternity in the fiery pits of hell
--- KAYLEE (spoken) ---
Hey!
--- TRENT ---
Shelby, you seem sweet to me
But if it has come to be
You've lost your virginity
We'll be stoning you and your family as well
--- SHELBY (spoken) ---
What?
--- TRENT ---
Or we could use some common sense instead
When you're lost it always helps recalling
Those immortal words that Jesus said
There's one rule that trumps them all
--- Unknown ---
Love Thy Neighbor
Love Thy Neighbor
Love Thy Neighbor trumps them all
Love Thy Neighbor
Love Thy Neighbor
Love Thy Neighbor trumps them all
--- SHELBY (spoken) ---
You know, you make a lot of sense
--- KAYLEE (spoken) ---
What are you talking about?
--- SHELBY (spoken) ---
You don't feel even slightly bad for Emma? You guys used to hang out
--- KAYLEE (spoken) ---
That was before she turned gay
--- SHELBY (spoken) ---
Well, maybe she was always gay
--- TRENT (spoken) ---
Exactly, because that's how God made her, Shelby
--- BOY 1 (spoken) ---
He's just trying to confuse us. My stepdad always says --
--- TRENT (spoken) ---
Woah, stepdad? You mean your parents are divorced?
--- BOY 1 (spoken) ---
Yeah, so?
--- TRENT (spoken) ---
Oh, divorce is a big no-no
--- TRENT ---
Not to oversimplify
But the scripture does imply
That your mom will have to die
How's tomorrow if she's not got any plans?
--- BOY 1 (spoken) ---
Uh
--- TRENT ---
There's no way to separate
Which rules you can violate
Let's hope you don't masturbate
'Cause the scripture says we'll have to cut off your hands
--- Unknown ---
Or we could use some common sense instead
When you're lost it always helps recalling
Those immortal words that Jesus said
--- ALL ---
There's one rule that trumps them all

Drop the hate
Raise your voices

Love Thy Neighbor is the one that trumps them all
