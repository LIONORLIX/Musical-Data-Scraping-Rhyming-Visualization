Since J.V. football, I've been adored
Big man on campus, but you're so bored
My life was perfect but so routine
I prayed for someone to intervene
--- Unknown ---
Then something
You happened
And turned my life around entirely
And that's 'cause
You happened
And look what happened to me
So go to Prom with me, Kaylee!
--- Unknown ---
(spoken)
--- KAYLEE ---
You're such an idiot, yes!
--- GUY ---
Hey Shelby, you're next.

There's not one subject that I could pass
Before you walked into my Spanish class
Was my heart pounding? I won't say no
'Cause life without you was no bueno
--- Unknown ---
Then something
You happened
And turned my life around entirely
And that's 'cause
You happened
And look what happened to me
So go to Prom with me Shelby!
--- Unknown ---
(spoken)
--- SHELBY ---
Si! Si se√±or!
--- Unknown ---
(sung)
--- EMMA ---
And no more hiding how we feel and more
--- ALYSSA ---
I won't hide if you're by my side
--- EMMA ---
Now that the Prom is back on track
And once we walk into that gym hand in hand
--- BOTH ---
It's pretty obvious there's no going back
--- ALYSSA ---
And that's a promise!
--- Unknown ---
Before I met you, I was a mess
Not honest with myself, I confess
--- EMMA ---
I was so lonely, a total wreck
Just sad and hopeless, check, double check
--- BOTH ---
Then something
You happened
And turned my life around entirely
And that's 'cause
You happened
And look what happened to me
--- Unknown ---
Something so
True happened
And soon it's time to share it publicly
And all 'cause
You happened
And said you'd go to prom with
Said you'd go to prom with
Said you'd go to Prom with
Me!
--- Unknown ---
Look what happened to me!
