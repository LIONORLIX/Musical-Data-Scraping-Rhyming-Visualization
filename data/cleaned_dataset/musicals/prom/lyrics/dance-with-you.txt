------ Dance with You ------
--- EMMA ---
I don’t want to start a riot
I don’t want to blaze a trail
I don’t want to be a symbol or cautionary tale
I don’t want to be a scapegoat for people to oppose
What I want is simple as far as wanting goes
--- Unknown ---
I just wanna dance with you
Let the whole world melt away and dance with you
Who cares what other people say?
And when we’re through no one can convince us we were wrong
All it takes is you and me and a song
--- Unknown ---
I don’t need a big production
Streamers hanging in the air
I don’t need to spend the night with confetti in my hair
I don’t need a room of people that I don’t really know
I just want to hold you and never let you go!
--- Unknown ---
I just wanna dance with you
Let the whole world melt away and dance with you
Who cares what other people say?
And when we’re through no one can convince us we were wrong
All it takes is you and me and a song
--- Unknown ---
Two people swaying slowly
Nothing more and nothing less
Why anybody fears that is anybody’s guess
I just wanna dance with you
Let the whole world melt away and dance with you
Who cares what other people say?
And when we’re through no one can convince us we were wrong
All it takes is you and me and a song
