------ Zazz ------
--- ANGIE ---
When a challenge lies ahead
And you are filled with dread and worry
Give it some zazz
--- Unknown ---
If your courage disappears
What'll get your fears to scurry
Give it some zazz
--- Unknown ---
Zazz is style plus confidence
It may seem corny or kitsch
But when scared or on the fence
You’ll find that zazz will soon make fear become your bitch
--- Unknown ---
And if folks say you can't win
What'll stop them in a hurry
Give it some zazz
There’s no contest for a girl who has some zazzmatazz
--- Unknown ---
So call their bluff
And strut your stuff
Like no chick in this hick town has
Instead of giving up
Give it some zazz
--- EMMA (spoken) ---
I just don't think I can do it. The thought of getting up in front of all of those people?
Look at my hands! They're shaking
--- ANGIE ---
If your hands are shaking
Just turn 'em into jazz hands
--- Unknown ---
(spoken)
Doesn't that feel better?
--- EMMA (spoken) ---
No
--- ANGIE (spoken) ---
Close your eyes. Think about Mrs. Greene. Think about that fake prom.
Now, think of finally doing something about it.
Oh, I'm seeing it! I'm seeing your zazz! Now follow me!
--- BOTH ---
Do like the brave and bossy do
And if they tear you apart
--- ANGIE ---
Ask what what would Bob Fosse do?
He'd make the people have a step ball change of heart
--- BOTH ---
Okay!
And if folks say you can’t win
What’ll stop them in a hurry
--- ANGIE ---
Give it some zazz
--- BOTH ---
There's no contest for a girl who has some zazzmatazz
--- ANGIE ---
So call their bluff
--- EMMA ---
Bam!
And strut my stuff
--- ANGIE ---
Bam!
--- BOTH ---
Like no chick in this hick town has
Instead of giving up
Give it some zazz
--- ANGIE (spoken) ---
Now that you’ve found your zazz, it's time to show it to the world.
You think you know how?
--- EMMA ---
Yeah
