------ Unruly Heart ------
--- Unknown ---
Some hearts can conform
Fit in the norm
Flaunting their love for all to see
I tried to change
Thinking how easy life could be
--- Unknown ---
I just kept on failing
I guess that was a sign
That there wasn't much hope
For this unruly heart of mine
--- Unknown ---
Then you came along
And right or wrong
Feelings began to overflow
We had to hide
Thinking that no one else could know
--- Unknown ---
And not having you near me
Was where I drew the line
So I had to conceal
This poor unruly heart of mine
--- Unknown ---
And though I don't know how or when
But somehow I learned to see
No matter what the world might say
This heart is the best part of me
--- Unknown ---
So fear's all in the past
Fading so fast
I won't stay hidden any more
I'm  who I am
And I think that's worth fighting for
--- Unknown ---
And nobody out there
Ever gets to define
The life I'm meant to lead
With this unruly heart of mine
--- spoken ---
Hi Emma, loved your video where do I start
I think my parents always knew
Nothing made sense until him
She’s the best thing in my life
The only good thing
But were always hiding
You’re not the only one
--- sung ---
And though I don't know how or when
But somehow I learned to see
No matter what the world might say
This heart is the best part of me
--- Unknown ---
So fear's all in the past
Fading so fast
I won't stay hidden any more
I'm who I am
And I think that's worth fighting for (that's worth of fighting for)
--- Unknown ---
And nobody out there
Ever gets to define
The life I'm meant to lead
With this unruly heart of mine
Mine
Mine
