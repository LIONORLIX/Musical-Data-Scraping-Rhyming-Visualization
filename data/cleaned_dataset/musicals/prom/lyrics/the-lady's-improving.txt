------ The Lady's Improving ------
--- DEE DEE ---
The lady's improving
So don't give up hope
You'll ask, is she perfect
My answer is nope!
--- MR. HAWKINS (spoken) ---
I know what you're doing
--- DEE DEE ---
Her range needs expanding
Her edges need sanding
But she can become a sure bet!
So I'm begging you sir
Don't give up on her yet
--- MR. HAWKINS (spoken) ---
You're trying to appeal to the fan in me
Well, it won't work
I'm not a fan anymore
--- DEE DEE ---
The lady's improving
So much that she gloats
I know you've got standards
Feel free to give notes
--- Unknown ---
There isn't an issue
And that's why I wish you
Could see there's no reason to fret!
So I'm begging you sir
Don't give up on her yet
--- MR. HAWKINS (spoken) ---
Seriously, Dee Dee, this is unsettling
It's like a fantasy that I don't want to have
--- DEE DEE ---
Everybody thinks that I've got some kinks
That I'll never work out
Even you're inclined
To think I'm unrefined
--- Unknown ---
But I promise with some time
That my aptitude will climb
And you'll leave your doubts
And disbeliefs behind!
--- Unknown ---
The lady's improving
Removing all doubt
She has hidden charms
That are sure to come out
--- Unknown ---
You're bound to discover
This book's not her cover
So don't make a move you'll regret!
So I'm begging you sir
No reneging on her
--- Unknown ---
Don't give up on her yet!
