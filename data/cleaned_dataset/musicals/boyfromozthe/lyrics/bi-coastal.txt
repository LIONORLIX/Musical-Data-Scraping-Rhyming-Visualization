------ Bi-Coastal ------
--- Unknown ---
You used to live in New York City
Then you moved to L.A.
But you still miss the streets
Where you used to play
--- Unknown ---
So you hurry on back there
(Even) Leave your pool and your car
Only to find you no longer belong
Fool don't you know what you are
--- Unknown ---
Hit the streets at midnight
Still dancing after dawn
But something seems to be missing
Just what are you running from
--- Unknown ---
Do you like your love in the dark
Or laid out in the sun
When you just can't make up your mind
Don't you know what you've become
--- Unknown ---
Bi-coastal, miss the natural speed of the city
Bi-coastal, California's fine if you're pretty
--- Unknown ---
Bi-coastal, when both are so much fun
Why do you have to pick one
--- Unknown ---
You can always hear me singing
Oh say can you see
From the towers of Manhattan
To the hills of Beverly
--- Unknown ---
All those girls in TV movies
All those boys on Broadway
When you can't make up your mind
You know you'd go either way
--- Unknown ---
Bi-coastal, miss the natural speed of the city
Bi-coastal, California's fine if you're pretty
Bi-coastal, when both are so much fun
