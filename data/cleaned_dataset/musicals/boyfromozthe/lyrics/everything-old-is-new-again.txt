------ Everything Old Is New Again ------
--- Unknown ---
When trumpets were mellow
And ev'ry gal only had one fellow
No need to remember when
'Cause ev'ry thing old is new again
--- Unknown ---
(Dancin' at) Your Long Island Jazz Age parties
Waiter, bring us more Bacardis
We'll order now what they ordered then
'Cause ev'ry thing old is new again
--- Unknown ---
Get out your white suit, your tap shoes and tails
Let's go backwards when all else(forward) fails
And movie stars you thought were long dead
Now are framed beside your bed
--- Unknown ---
Don't throw the past away
You might need it some rainy day
Dreams can come true again
When ev'ry thing old is new again
--- Unknown ---
Get out your white suit, your tap shoes and tails
Put it in backward when forward fails
But leave Greta Garbo alone
Be a movie star on your own
--- Unknown ---
And don't throw the past away
You might need it some rainy day
Dreams can come true again
When ev'ry thing old is new again
