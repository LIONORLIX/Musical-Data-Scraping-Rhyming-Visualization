------ Come Save Me ------
--- Unknown ---
Come save me
I'm fading fast
Why can't we be together
And maybe I just won't last
If I'm not with you forever
--- Unknown ---
Now I'm touching the stars
And up here on mars
I can rarely breathe
--- Unknown ---
Friends, that's why I smile
'Cause all the while
I've got you up my sleeve
--- Unknown ---
Come take me, I'm ready for
All that I've never tasted
Come wake me, let's make up for
All of the good time we've wasted
--- Unknown ---
Now my heart is at stake
My poor heart could break
I might die if you leave
--- Unknown ---
Friends, ask why I cry
I don't know why
I don't really believe
You'll save me
--- Unknown ---
Come save me
--- Unknown ---
Now I'm touching the stars
And up here on mars
I can rarely breathe
--- Unknown ---
Friends, ask why I smile
'Cause all the while
I've got you up my sleeve
--- Unknown ---
Come save me
Save me, save me, save me
