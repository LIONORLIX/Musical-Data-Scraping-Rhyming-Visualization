------ Love Crazy ------
--- CHRIS ---
Listen to the music in your voice
--- PETER ---
You can hear the music everywhere
--- Unknown ---
Chris
Catch the melody above the noise
--- PETER ---
You can feel it pulsing through the air
--- BOTH ---
The whole world is buzzin'
And the light from the sun
Combined with ev'rything
All makes me
--- Unknown ---
Love crazy
Livin' is a crazy thing
Love crazy
Energy is ev'rything
--- PETER ---
Listen to the music in the water
Don't you see it swim before your eyes
--- CHRIS ---
Try to fill it up and full of wonder
How the sun can set and the moon can rise
--- BOTH ---
The whole world is buzzin'
And the light from the stars
Combined with ev'rything
All makes me
--- Unknown ---
Love crazy
Livin' is a crazy thing
Love crazy
Energy is ev'rything (repeat)
--- ALL ---
Don't cha know the whole world is buzzin'
And the light from the sun
Combined with ev'rything
All makes me
--- Unknown ---
Love crazy
Livin' is a crazy thing
Love crazy
