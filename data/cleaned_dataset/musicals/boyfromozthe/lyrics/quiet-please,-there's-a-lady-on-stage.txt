------ Quiet Please, There's a Lady on Stage ------
--- Unknown ---
Quiet please, there's a lady on stage.
She may not be the latest rage,
But she's singing, and she means it.
And she deserves a little silence.
--- Unknown ---
Quiet please, there's a woman up there,
And she's been honest through her songs
Long before your consciousness was raised.
Now doesn't that deserve a little praise.
--- Unknown ---
So put your hands together, help her along,
All that's left of the singers, all that's left of the song.
Stand for the ovation,
And give her one last celebration.
--- Unknown ---
Quiet please, there's a person up there,
Who's singing of the sins that none of us could bear
To hear for ourselves,
Now give her your respect if nothing else.
--- Unknown ---
So put your hands together, help her along,
All that's left of the singers, all that's left of the song.
Rise to the occasion,
And give her one last celebration.
--- Unknown ---
Quiet please, there's a lady on stage.
Conductor, turn the final page.
When it's over, we can all go home.
She lives on on the stage alone.
--- Unknown ---
So put your hands together, help her along,
All that's left of the singers, all that's left of the song.
Stand for the ovation,
And give her one last celebration.
--- Unknown ---
Put your hands together, help her along,
Let's just stay here all night; let's sing every song.
Won't you rise, rise to the occasion,
