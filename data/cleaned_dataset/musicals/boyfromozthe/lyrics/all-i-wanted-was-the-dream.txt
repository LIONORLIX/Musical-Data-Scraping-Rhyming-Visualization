------ All I Wanted Was the Dream ------
--- Unknown ---
All I wanted was the dream
Just like anybody else
I didn't want it pushed aside
Forgotten on a shelf
--- Unknown ---
I wanted laughs and lots of lovers
And limitless wealth
I just want to say you're better
Than anybody else
--- Unknown ---
All I wanted was the time
To obliterate my past
I didn't know that time can come and go
So terribly fast
--- Unknown ---
It's hard to lose it
When you had it right here
In your grasp
But then you wake up and it seems
The dream that you dream
