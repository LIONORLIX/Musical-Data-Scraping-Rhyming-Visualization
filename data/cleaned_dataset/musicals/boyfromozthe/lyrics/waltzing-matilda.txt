------ Waltzing Matilda ------
--- Unknown ---
Once a jolly swagman camped by a billabong
Under the shade of a coolibah tree,
And he sang as he watched and waited till his billy boiled:
Who'll come a-waltzing Matilda, with me?
--- Unknown ---
Waltzing Matilda, waltzing Matilda
You'll come a-waltzing Matilda, with me
And he sang as he watched and waited till his billy boiled:
You'll come a-waltzing Matilda, with me.
--- Unknown ---
Down came a jumbuck to drink at that billabong.
Up jumped the swagman and grabbed him with glee.
And he sang as he shoved that jumbuck in his tucker bag:
You'll come a-waltzing Matilda, with me.
--- Unknown ---
Waltzing Matilda, waltzing Matilda
You'll come a-waltzing Matilda, with me,
And he sang as he shoved that jumbuck in his tucker bag:
You'll come a-waltzing Matilda, with me.
--- Unknown ---
Up rode the squatter, mounted on his thoroughbred.
Down came the troopers, one, two, and three.
Whose[N 1] is that [N 2]jumbuck you've got in your tucker bag?
You'll come a-waltzing Matilda, with me.
--- Unknown ---
Waltzing Matilda, waltzing Matilda
You'll come a-waltzing Matilda, with me,
Whose is that jumbuck you've got in your tucker bag?
You'll come a-waltzing Matilda, with me.
--- Unknown ---
Up jumped the swagman and sprang into the billabong.
You'll never take me alive! said he
And his ghost may be heard as you pass by that billabong:
Who'll come a-waltzing Matilda, with me?
--- Unknown ---
Waltzing Matilda, waltzing Matilda
You'll come a-waltzing Matilda, with me,
And his ghost may be heard as you pass by that billabong:
