------ When I Get My Name in Lights (Reprise) ------
--- Unknown ---
And soon they'll all know my name
I'll have fortune and fame
When I get my name in lights
It can happen overnight in these modern times
--- Unknown ---
I'll sit on a flag pole
Whatever's the rage
Just to get my picture on the front page
