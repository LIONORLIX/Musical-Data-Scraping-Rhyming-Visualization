------ She Loves to Hear the Music ------
--- Unknown ---
I?ve been listening quietly
Just waiting for my turn
When it comes to music
There aint nothing I can learn
Cuz everything I live and breathe
Is written on an album sleeve
I can tell you who is hot
Who will make it
And who will not
--- Unknown ---
Cuz I love to hear the music
I've got every lyric down
I love to hear them say I?ve got
The greatest ears in town
There at every studio
There aint a pop star I don?t know
And sometimes they take me home
But I always wake up alone
--- Unknown ---
Men that want to marry me they never satisfy
The inner rhythms that I hear are all that keep me high
So they turn around and go
And leave me by my radio
I didn?t love them anyway no tlike the way I love the man who play
--- Unknown ---
I love to hear the music
I've got every lyric down
I love to hear them say I?ve got
The greatest ears in town
I?m there at every studio
The first to come the last to go
Sometimes they take me home
But I always wake up alone, alone, alone, alone!!!
--- Unknown ---
That?s Me
--- Unknown ---
Let me, let me, let me, let me, let me hear the music
Yeah!
--- Unknown ---
I love to hear the music
I've got every lyric down
I love to hear them say I?ve got
The greatest ears in town
I love to hear it
I love to hear the music
The music oh I love it!
