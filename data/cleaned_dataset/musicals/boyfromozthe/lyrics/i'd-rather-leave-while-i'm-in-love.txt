------ I'd Rather Leave While I'm in Love ------
--- Unknown ---
I'd rather leave while I'm in love
While I still believe the meaning of the word
I'll keep my dreams and just pretend
That you and I were never gonna(meant to) end
--- Unknown ---
Too many times I've seen the rose die on the vine
Somebody's heart gets broken
Usually it's mine
I don't wanna take the chance of being hurt again
And you and I can't say goodbye
--- Unknown ---
So if you wake and find me gone
Hey babe, just carry on
You see I need my fantasy
I still believe
It's best to leave while I'm in love
