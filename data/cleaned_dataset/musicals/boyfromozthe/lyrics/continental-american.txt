------ Continental American ------
--- Unknown ---
Once there was a time
When this town was so high
We could never come down
When rules did not apply
We would drink fountains dry
In a club filled with sound
And bands would play to please me
You found a partner easy
The name game was the only game in town
--- Unknown ---
Nights would end at 6 A.M.
Sleep all day
And then start dancing again
The first to see the end
We did the Continental American
--- Unknown ---
All our clothes from France
Soul Train taught us to dance
We had smoke in our eyes
Friends were lost and found
We were Paradise bound
Some got lost, nobody cried
Others took their places
Always strange new faces
Always one more chance to go around
--- Unknown ---
Nights would end at 6 A.M.
Sleep all day
And then start dancing again
The first to see the end
We did the Continental American
--- Unknown ---
Now we're staying in
Let the new dance begin
But those kids look(seem) so young
All dressed up in our clothes
But what none of them knows
Is we really had fun!
When bands would play to please us(me)
You found a partner easy
Scott and Zelda should have seen us then
When nights would end at 6 A.M.
Sleep all day
And then start dancing again
The first to see the end
Manhattan pioneers
