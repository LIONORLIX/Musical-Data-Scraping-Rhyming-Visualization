------ I Still Call Australia Home ------
--- Unknown ---
I've been to cities that never close down
From New York to Rio and old London town
But no matter how far
Or how wide I roam
I still call Australia home
--- Unknown ---
I'm always travelin'
And I love bein' free
So I keep leavin' the sun and the sea
But my heart lies waiting over the foam
I still call Australia home
--- Unknown ---
All the sons and daughters spinning 'round the world
Away from their families and friends
Ah, but as the world gets older and colder
It's good to know where your journey ends
--- Unknown ---
And someday we'll all be together once more
When all the ships come back to the shore
Then I realize something I've always known
I still call Australia home
--- Unknown ---
No matter how far
Or how wide I roam
