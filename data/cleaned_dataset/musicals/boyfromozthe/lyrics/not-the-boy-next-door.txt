------ Not the Boy Next Door ------
--- Unknown ---
Comin' home used to feel(my way is still) so good
I'm a stranger now in my neighborhood
I've seen the world at a faster pace
And I'm comin' now from a diff'rent place
--- Unknown ---
Though I may look the same way to you
Underneath there is somebody new
--- Unknown ---
I am not the boy next door
I don't belong like I did before
Nothin' ever seems like it used to be
You can have your dreams, but you can't have me
--- Unknown ---
I can't go back there anymore
'Cause I am not the boy next door
--- Unknown ---
You've been savin' (all) those souvenirs,
Faded photographs from my(our) foolish years
We made plans, but they're wearin' thin
And they won't work out 'cause I don't(won't) fit in
--- Unknown ---
And those mem'ries will just weigh me down
'Cause I got no place to keep 'em uptown
--- Unknown ---
I am not the boy next door
I don't belong like I did before
Nothin' ever seems like it used to be
You can have your dreams, but you can't have me
--- Unknown ---
I can't go back there anymore
'Cause I am not the boy next door
--- Unknown ---
And I'm sorry for just bein' me
But if you'd look past the past you could see
