------ When I Get My Name in Lights ------
--- YOUNG PETER ---
I'll dance I'll sing I'll do anything
Just to get my name in lights
I've got to try to hit the heights
Now that I'm free as the breeze again
Old nimble knees again
--- Unknown ---
And soon they'll all know my name
I'll have fortune and fame
When I get my name in lights
It can happen overnight in these modern times
--- Unknown ---
So hold that front page
This boy was born to strut the stage
I tap and sing and play the pianuh
Splash my name across a big bright bannuh
--- Unknown ---
And that's why
I won't let go til I'm on the radio
And when they come to see the sights
That will be my name spelt right
Lighting up Times Square
--- Unknown ---
I'll sit on a flag pole
Whatever's the rage
Just to get my picture on the front page
Just to get my name in lights
--- ALL ---
So hold the front page
This boy was born to strut the stage
--- YOUNG PETER ---
I tap and sing and play piannuh
--- ALL ---
Splash his (my) name
------ fin ------
