------ You and Me ------
--- Unknown ---
You and me
We wanted it all
We wanted it all
Passion without pain
Sunshine without rainy days
We wanted it all ways
--- Unknown ---
You and me
We reached for the sky
The limit was high
Never giving in
Certain we would(could) win that prize
I should have seen it in your eyes
--- Unknown ---
Look how all our dreams came true
See how I've got me
And baby(See how) you've got you
And thru it all(And after all)
Just one thing died
A little thing called love
A feeling deep inside(We used to feel inside)
--- Unknown ---
You and me
We're not like the rest
We once were the best
(And) Back when we were dumb
When(How) did we become so smart
And learn(We learned) to break each other's hearts
--- Unknown ---

You and me
We're not like the rest
We once were the best
(And) Back when we were dumb
When(How) did we become so smart
Cause we almost made it
--- Unknown ---
You and me
We're not like the rest
We once were the best
Look what we became
Isn't it a cryin' shame
That we almost made it
But we wanted it all

You and me
