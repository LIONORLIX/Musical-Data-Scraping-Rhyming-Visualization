------ Once Before I Go ------
--- Unknown ---
Once before I go
I want you to know
That I would do it all again
I'm sure I'd make the same mistakes
But I could make it through
The pains and joys and aches
I knew back then
I'd do it all
I'd do it all again
--- Unknown ---
Before I go
I want you to know
That I look back with no regrets
And when our luck was wearing thin
And we were down and out
And still came back to win against all bets
Now when I look back
I still have no regrets
--- Unknown ---
And it's so hard to say good-byes
When there's so much that's left
Unspoken in your eyes
But unless I spread my wings again
I'm afraid I'll never soar
So hang on to the memories
And hold me close once more
--- Unknown ---
Once more
Just once before I go
I want you to know
That I have loved you all along
And even when we're far apart
I only need to feel you're living in my heart
And I'll be strong
Love you just the way
I've loved you all along
--- Unknown ---
And it's so hard to say good-byes
When there's so much that's left
Unspoken in your eyes
But unless I spread my wings again
I'm afraid I'll never soar
So kiss me for the last time
And hold me close once more
--- Unknown ---
Once more
Just once before I go
I want you to know
That I have loved you all along
And even when we're far apart
I only need to feel you're living in my heart
And I'll be strong
--- Unknown ---
You are the light that shines on me
You always were and you'll always be
So I had to let you know
Just this once
Just this once
