------ Love Don't Need a Reason ------
--- Unknown ---
If your heart always did
What a normal heart should do
If you always play a part
Instead of being who you really are
--- Unknown ---
Then(And) you might just miss
The one who's standing there
So instead of passing by
Show him(the someone) that you care
Instead asking why
Why me? And why you?
Why not we two?
--- Unknown ---
'Cause love don't need a reason
Love don't always rhyme
And love is all we have for now
What we don't have is time
--- Unknown ---
If we always believe
All the madness that we're taught
Never questioning the rules
Then we(you)'re living lies we(you) bought so long ago
How are they to know?
--- Unknown ---
It's not who's wrong or right
It's just another way
And I don't wanna fight(It's not about a fight)
But know I'm gonna(It's just I wanna) stay with you till the end
With you my friend
--- Unknown ---
'Cause love don't need a reason
Love don't always rhyme
And love is all we have for now
What we don't have is time
--- Unknown ---
I'll hold you close
Time can't(won't) tear us apart
Forever, I will stand by you
We've(It's) got to start with the beat of one heart
Together, we will(can) see this through
--- Unknown ---
'Cause love don't need a reason
Love's never a crime
And love is all we have for now
What we don't have
