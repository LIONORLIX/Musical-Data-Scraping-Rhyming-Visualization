------ Sandy ------
--- DANNY ---
Stranded at the drive in, branded a fool
What will they say, Monday at school?
--- Unknown ---
Sandy, can't?you?see? I'm in?misery
We made a start, now we're?apart
There's nothin' left for me
Love has flown all alone
I sit?and?wonder?why-yi-yi
Oh why you?left me, oh?Sandy
--- Unknown ---
Oh Sandy, baby someday, when hi-i-igh school is done
Somehow, someway, our two worlds will be one
In heaven forever and ever we will be
Oh please say you'll stay, oh Sandy
--- Unknown ---
(spoken)
Sandy my darlin', you hurt me real bad
You know it's true
But baby, you gotta believe me when I say that
I'm helpless without you
--- Unknown ---
(sung)
Love has flown all alone
I sit, I wonder why-y-y
Oh why you left me, oh Sandy
--- Unknown ---
Oh Sandy
Oh Sandy
Why-y-y-y
