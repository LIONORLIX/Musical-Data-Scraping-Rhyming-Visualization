I solve my problems and I see the light
We got a lovin' thing, we gotta feed it right
There ain't no danger we can go to far
We start believing now that we can be what we are
Grease is the word

They think our love is just a growing pain
Why can't they understand? It's just a cryin' shame
Their lips are lying only real is real
We stop the fight right now, we got to be what feel
Grease is the word

Grease is the word, is the word that you heard
It's got groove it's got meaning
Grease is the time, is the place, is the motion
Grease is the way we are feeling

We take the pressure and we throw away
Conventionalitly belongs to yesterday
There is a chance that we can make it so far
We start believing now but we can be who we are
Grease is the word
