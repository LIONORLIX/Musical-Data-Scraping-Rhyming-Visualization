Summer loving happened so fast

--- DANNY ---
Took her bowling in the arcade
--- SANDY ---
We went strolling, drank lemonade
--- DANNY ---
We made out under the dock
--- SANDY ---
We stayed out till ten o'clock
--- BOTH ---
Summer fling, don't mean a thing
But, uh-oh, the summer nights
--- ALL ---

--- BOYS ---
Tell me more, tell me more
Could she get me a friend?
--- SANDY ---
It turned colder that's where it ends
--- DANNY ---
So I told her we'd still be friends
--- SANDY ---
Then we made our true love vow
--- DANNY ---
Wonder what she's doing now
