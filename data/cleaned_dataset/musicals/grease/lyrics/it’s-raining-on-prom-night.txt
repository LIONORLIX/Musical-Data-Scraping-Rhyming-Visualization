------ Itâ€™s Raining on Prom Night ------
--- CHA-CHA ---
I was deprived of a young girl's dream
By the cruel force of nature from the blue
--- SANDY ---
Instead of a night full of romance supreme
--- CHA-CHA & SANDY ---
All I got was a runny nose and Asiatic flu
--- SANDY ---
It's raining
--- CHA-CHA ---
It's raining
--- SANDY ---
On prom night
--- CHA-CHA ---
On prom night
--- SANDY ---
My hair is a mess
--- CHA-CHA ---
Oh ho my hair is a mess
--- SANDY ---
It's running
--- CHA-CHA ---
It's running
--- SANDY ---
All over
--- CHA-CHA ---
All over
--- SANDY ---
My taffeta dress
--- CHA-CHA ---
Oh ho my taffeta dress
--- SANDY ---
It's wilting
--- CHA-CHA ---
It's wilting
--- SANDY ---
The quilting
[CHA-CHA]
The quilting
--- SANDY ---
In my Maidenform
--- CHA-CHA ---
Oh in my Maidenform
--- SANDY ---
And mascara flows
--- CHA-CHA ---
Mascara flows
--- SANDY ---
Right down my nose
--- CHA-CHA ---
Right down my nose
--- SANDY ---
Because of the storm
--- CHA-CHA ---
Because it's raining
[SANDY & CHA-CHA]
I don't even have my corsage, oh gee
It fell down a sewer with my sister's ID
--- CHA-CHA ---
It's raining
--- SANDY ---
It's raining
--- CHA-CHA ---
On prom night
--- SANDY ---
On prom night
--- CHA-CHA ---
What can I do?
--- SANDY ---
It's raining
--- CHA-CHA ---
It's raining
--- SANDY, ---
Rain from the ski?s
--- CHA-CHA ---
Rain from the skies
--- SANDY ---
It's raining
--- CHA-CHA ---
Tears from my ?yes over you
It's raining
--- SANDY, spoken ---
Oh dear God, let him feel the same way I do right now
--- CHA-CHA ---
On prom night
--- SANDY, spoken ---
Make him want to see me again
--- CHA-CHA ---
What can I do?
--- SANDY ---
Oh, what can I do?
--- SANDY & CHA-CHA ---
It's raining rain from the skies
It's raining tears from my eyes over you
Raining
--- SANDY ---
Ooo
--- CHA-CHA ---
Raining
--- SANDY & CHA-CHA ---
Raining on prom night
