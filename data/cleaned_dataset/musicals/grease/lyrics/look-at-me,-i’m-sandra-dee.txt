------ Look at Me, I’m Sandra Dee ------
--- RIZZO ---
Look at me, I’m Sandra Dee
Lousy with virginity
Can’t go to bed ’til I’m legally wed
I can’t, I’m Sandra Dee
--- Unknown ---
Watch it, hey, I’m Doris Day
I was not brought up that way
Won’t come across, even Rock Hudson lost
His heart to Doris Day
--- Unknown ---
I don’t drink or swear
I don’t, ew, rat my hair
I get ill from one cigarette
Keep your filthy paws off my silky drawers
Would you pull that stuff with Annette?
Bad boy
--- Unknown ---
As for you, Troy Donahue
I know what you wanna do
You've got your crust
I’m no object of lust
I’m just plain Sandra Dee
--- Unknown ---
Elvis, Elvis, let me be
Keep that pelvis far from me
Just keep your cool
Now your starting to drool
