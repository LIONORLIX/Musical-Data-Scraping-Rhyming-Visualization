------ Look At Me, Iâ€™m Sandra Dee (Reprise) ------
--- SANDY ---
Look at me, there has to be
Something more than what they see
Wholesome and pure
Oh so scared and unsure
A poor man's Sandra Dee
--- Unknown ---
When they criticize and make fun of me
Can't they see the tears in my smile
Don't they realize there's just one of me
And it has to last me awhile
--- Unknown ---
(spoken)
Hello, Frenchy, can you come over for a little while?
And bring your makeup case
--- Unknown ---
(Sung)
Sandy, you must start anew
Don't you know what you must do?
Hold your head high
Take a deep breath and cry
