Freddy my love, I miss you more than words can say (Oh-oh-oh)
Freddy my love, please keep in touch while you're away (Oh yeah)
Hearing from you can make the day so much better (Ooo)
Getting a souvenir or maybe a letter (Ooo)
I really flipped over the great cashmere sweater (Ooo)
Freddy my love
--- ALL ---
Freddy my love, Freddy my love, Freddy my love
--- MARTY (GIRLS) ---
Freddy you know, your absence makes me feel so blue (So blue)
That's okay though, your presents make me think of you (Sure they do)
My mom will have a heart-attack when she catches (Ooo)
Those peddle pushers with the black leather patches (Ooo-ahh)
Oh how I wish I had a jacket that matches, Freddy my love (Ooo)
Freddy my love
--- ALL ---
Freddy my love, Freddy my love, Freddy my love
--- MARTY (GIRLS) ---
Don't keep your letters from me (Hey now, hey now)
I quilt to every line (Hey now, hey now)
Your spelling's kinda crummy (Hey now, hey now)
But honey so is mine (Hey now, hey now)
I treasure every gift (Hey now, hey now)
The ring is really nifty (Hey now, hey now)
You say it cost you fifty, so you're thrifty, I don't mind (Ooo ooo)
--- Unknown ---
Whoa - Freddy you see, you'll hold me in your arms someday (Freddy my love)
And I will be wearing your lacy lingerie (Freddy I'm yours)
Thinking about it, my heart's pounding already (Oh yeah, uh-huh)
Knowing when you come home, we're bound to go steady (Ooo-ahh)
And through your service pay around my confetti, Freddy my love (Ooo)

Freddy my love

Freddy my love, Freddy my love - ooh Freddy
Freddy my love, Freddy my love, Freddy my love
Freddy my love, Freddy my love, Freddy my love
Freddy my love, Freddy my love, Freddy my love

Ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo
