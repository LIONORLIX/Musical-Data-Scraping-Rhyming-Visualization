(Sung)
Well before I was born late one night
My poppa said everything's alright
The doctor laughed when ma laid down
With her stomach pouncing all around
Cause the beebop stork was about to arrive
Mamma gave birth to a hand jive, ahh
--- Unknown ---
I could barely walk when I milked a cow
When I was three I pushed a plow
While chopping wood I moved my legs
And I started dancing while I gathered eggs
The townsfolk clapped I was only five
But I'm dancing off, he's born to hand jive
Ah yeah
--- Unknown ---
Here we go let's go
