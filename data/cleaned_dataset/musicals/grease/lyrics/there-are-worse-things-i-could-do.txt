------ There Are Worse Things I Could Do ------
--- RIZZO ---
There are worse things I could do
Than go with a boy or two
Even though the neighborhood thinks I'm trashy and no good
I suppose it could be true
But there’s worse things I could do
--- Unknown ---
I could flirt with all the guys
Smile at them and bat my eyes
Press against them when we dance
Make them think they stand a chance
Then refuse to see it through
That's a thing I'd never do
--- Unknown ---
I could stay home every night
Wait around for Mr. Right
Take cold showers every day
And throw my life away
On a dream that won’t come true
--- Unknown ---
I could hurt someone like me
Out of spite or jealousy
I don't steal and I don't lie
But I can feel and I can cry
A fact I'll bet you never knew
But to cry in front of you
