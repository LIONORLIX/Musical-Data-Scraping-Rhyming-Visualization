Your story, sad to tell
A teenage ne'er do well
Most mixed up, non-delinquent on the block
Your future's so unclear now
What's left of your career now?
Can't even get a trade-in on your smock

Beauty school dropout (Ooo)
No graduation day for you (Ooo-ahh-oo)
Beauty school dropout (Ooo)
Missed your midterms and flunked shampoo (Ooo-ahh-oo)

To wash and clean your clothes up (Ooo)
After spending all that dough to have (Ooo)
The doctor fix your nose up (Ooo-ahh-ooo)

Baby get moving (Ooo-op, doo-wop)
Why keep your feeble hopes alive? (Ah, ah-ah-ah-ah)
What are you proving? (Doo-wop, doo-wop)
You've got the dream, but not the drive (Ah, ah-ah-ah-ah)
If you go for your diploma, you could join a steno pool (Doo-wop, di-doo-wop, di-doo, wa-ooo)
Turn in your teasin' comb and go back to high school (Babababa, babababa)

You think you're such a looker (Ahh)
But no customer would go to you unless she was a hooker (Ahh)
--- Unknown ---
Baby don't sweat it (Ooo-wop, don't sweat it)
You're not cut out to hold a job (Doo-wop, job)
Better forget it (Forget it, forget it)
Who wants their hair done by a slob? (Doo-wop, slob)
--- Unknown ---
Now your bangs are curled, your lashes whirled (Ah-ah-ah-ahhh)
But still the world is cruel (Ooo)
Wipe off that angel face and go back to high school

You put my good advice to shame (Ooo-ahh)
Baby you knew it (Baby you knew it)
Betcha Dear Abby'd say the same (Ooo-ahh)

No matter who may try
