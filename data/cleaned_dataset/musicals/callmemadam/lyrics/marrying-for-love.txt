------ Marrying for Love ------
--- Unknown ---
Ten generations of Constantins
Lived very comf'table lives
They were contented to live in style
Supported by their wives
Daughters of men who were wealthy
Fitted them like a glove
They all married for money
I mean to marry for love
--- Unknown ---
It's an old-fashioned idea, marrying for love
And that old-fashioned idea's what I'm thinking of
--- Unknown ---
Where there's love, poets have said
Two can live as one
That's an old-fashioned idea
But it's being done
--- Unknown ---
When I find the man that I'm crazy about
There's much that I could do without
But I couldn't do without love
--- Unknown ---
Just an old-fashioned romance with a moon above
A romance, one that will end marrying for love
That's the kind of love
That I'm thinking of
--- alternate bridge for male: ---
If she must have gold, let it be in her hair
Rubies, let them be in her lips
