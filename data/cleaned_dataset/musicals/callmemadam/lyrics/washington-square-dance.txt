------ Washington Square Dance ------
--- Unknown ---
Square dance
The Washington Square dance
Republicans make up with the Democrats
Show those foreign diplomats
That you dare dance
The Washington Square dance
--- Unknown ---
No matter which side you're on or where you stand
Take your partner by the hand
And each pair dance
The Washington Square dance
--- Unknown ---
The theme is a get-together policy
Show your friends across the sea
It's a fair dance
The Washington Square dance
--- Unknown ---
The rules are the same as cricket, golf or squash
No fair cheatin' 'cause the Wash-
-ington Square dance is square
--- Unknown ---
-Bow to your partners, bow to your corners
Dance till your cheeks are red as a rose
But try not to step on your partner's toes
-Now, duck for the oyster, dig for the clam
Duck for the oyster, dig for the clam
But do your diggin' for Uncle Sam
-One for the money, two for the show
One for the money, two for the show
Three to make ready for Uncle Joe
-Republicans over to the right
-Democrats over to the left
The left meet the right and don't explode
Try to find the middle of the road
--- Unknown ---
And square dance, the Washington Square dance
Be careful, you'll have to watch your step, by gosh!
No round heels because the Wash-
