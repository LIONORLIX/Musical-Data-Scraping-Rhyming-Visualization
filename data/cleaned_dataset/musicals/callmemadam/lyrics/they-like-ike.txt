The presidential year will soon be drawing near
The people soon will choose their fav'rite son
I wonder what they'll do in nineteen fifty-two
I wonder who they'll send to Washington
--- Unknown ---
They like Ike
And Ike is good on a mike
They like Ike
-But Ike says he don't wanna
--- Unknown ---
That makes Ike
The kind of feller they like
And what's more
They seem to think he's gonna
--- Unknown ---
-But Harry won't get out
-They're in for plenty of fights
-Harry won't get out
-He's got squatter's rights
--- Unknown ---
But there's Ike
And Ike is good on a mike
And they know
The votes that he can carry
-But don't forget there's Harry
But they like Ike

For nearly twenty years we've had the people's cheers
The Democrats continue to advance
Of course, they could arrange to make a sudden change
But none's around who seems to have a chance
--- Unknown ---
Ta, ta, ta, ta, ta, ta
They like Ike
And Ike is good on a mike
They like Ike
-But Ike says he's not bidding
--- Unknown ---
That makes Ike
The kind of feller they like
And what's more
They seem to think he's kidding
--- Unknown ---
-But Harry won't consent
-They'll get a sock on the jaw
-Republican President?
-That's against the law
--- Unknown ---
If it's Ike
Your Chief can go on a hike
And we boys
Will see he doesn't tarry
-Please don't do that to Harry!
But they like Ike

They won't take Saltonstall and Sasscer's chance is small
The same would go for Vandenburg and Taft
And Dewey's right in line with William Jennings Bryan
There isn't anyone that they can draft
--- Unknown ---
Except for the fact that
They like Ike
And Ike is good on a mike
They like Ike
-But Ike says he won't take it
--- Unknown ---
That makes Ike
The kind of feller they like
And what's more
They seem to think he'll make it
--- Unknown ---
-But Harry's on the ground
-And should Republicans win
-When they come around
-He won't let them in
--- Unknown ---
If it's Ike
Your Chief can get on his bike
And his things
A moving van will carry
-They can't do that to Harry!
