Money, money, money, money, money, money
Can you use any dollars today?
Money, money, money, money, money, money
We've so much that it gets in our way
--- Unknown ---
In our Treas'ry there's a mighty sum
Millions we've subtracted from
The envelopes that hold our take home pay
Can you use any money today?
--- Unknown ---
Home in the states underground there's a cave full of gold
Back up a truck and we'll fill it with all it can hold
Take ten million and please don't fuss
If you find it can't be spent
You can lend it right back to us
And we'll pay you seven percent
--- Unknown ---
Money, money, money, money, money, money
Uncle Sam puts it right on the line
And if that feller with whiskers ever should decline
You can have mine
All of mine
