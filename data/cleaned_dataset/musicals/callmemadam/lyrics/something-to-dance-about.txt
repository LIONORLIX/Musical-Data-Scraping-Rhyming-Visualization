------ Something to Dance About ------
--- Unknown ---
An old hand at giving parties I've learned an awful lot
The best reason for a party
And what keeps it boiling hot
An occasion when you've got
--- Unknown ---
Something to dance about
Someone to dance it with
Something to dance it to
To a fox-trot or a waltz
--- Unknown ---
Put on your dancing shoes
Here comes some happy news
Break up in twos and twos
To a fox-trot or a waltz
--- Unknown ---
You and someone have parted
And your lonely heart yearns
While you're there broken hearted
Suddenly he returns
--- Unknown ---
That's something to dance about
With someone to dance it with
Pick something to dance it to
To a fox-trot or a waltz
To a Charleston or a waltz
To a Tango or a waltz
--- Blues tempo: ---
Dance to the blues
Something to dance about
Someone to dance it with
Something to dance it to Blues
--- Rhumba tempo: ---
Dance it to a rhumba
Ah
--- Coda: ---
To a fox-trot, Charleston, Tango or a waltz
