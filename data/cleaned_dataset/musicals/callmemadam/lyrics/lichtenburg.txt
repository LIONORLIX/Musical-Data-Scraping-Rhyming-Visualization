------ Lichtenburg ------
--- Unknown ---
I don't think you know much about us
Except, of course, our famous Lichtenburg cheese
I know very well you enjoy it
And we would enjoy it too
But we can't afford it for we must have money
And so we send it to you
But Lichtenburg won't be offended
We'll manage to stay alive
We're not very touchy
This quaint little duchy
That somehow seems to survive
--- Unknown ---
Too small to be a city
Too big to be a town
Too poor to have an army
And too easy to knock down
--- Unknown ---
Too little to sell across the seas
Babies and cheese are our main industries
--- Unknown ---
Too slow to please the young folk
Too fast to please the old
Too many who have copper pennies
Too few who have gold
--- Unknown ---
But somehow we manage to play the game
While the other lands keep changing hands
Old Lichtenburg stays the same

5.Can You Use Any Money Today?
--- Unknown ---
Money, money, money, money, money, money
Can you use any money today?
Money, money, money, money, money, money
Nice new bills that we're giving away
--- Unknown ---
There are photographs on ev'ry one
Lincoln, Grant and Washington
Or you might like the ones with Henry Clay
Can you use any money today?
--- Unknown ---
Two million, four million, six million, ten
Take what you want, when it's gone you can come back again
--- Unknown ---
Bills that haven't been printed yet
You can have them by the sack
Coins that haven't been minted yet
That you never have to give back
--- Unknown ---
Money, money, money, money, money, money
Uncle Sam puts it right on the line
And if we ever run out of checks for him to sign
You can have mine
All of mine
