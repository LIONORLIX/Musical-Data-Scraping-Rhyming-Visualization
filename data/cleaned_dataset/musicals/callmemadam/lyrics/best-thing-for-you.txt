------ Best Thing for You ------
--- Unknown ---
Please let me say from the start
I don't pretend to be smart
I just suggest what I think best
Having your int'rest at heart
--- Unknown ---
I only want what's the best thing for you
And the best thing for you would be me
--- Unknown ---
I've been convinced after thinking it through
That the best thing for you would be me
--- Unknown ---
Ev'ry day
To myself I say
Point the way
What will it be
--- Unknown ---
I ask myself what's the best thing for you
And myself and I seem to agree
