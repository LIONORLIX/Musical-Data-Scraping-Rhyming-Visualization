------ Ocarina ------
--- Unknown ---
Listen to the ocarina play
Listen, don't you seem to hear it say
--- Unknown ---
Dance to the music of the ocarina
Ocarina, ocarina
Gretchen and Otto, Hans and Wilhelmina
Dance to the ocarina dance
--- Unknown ---
Dance to the music of the sweet potata
Sweet potata, sweet potata
Cheeks gettin' redder than a ripe tomata
Dance to the ocarina dance
--- Unknown ---
Listen and hear the notes escaping
Out of that tiny hole
Doesn't it please your soul?
Doesn't it say, Dance the polka?
--- Unknown ---
Step to the music of the ocarina
Who refuses? Wilhelmina?
Wait till she listens to the ocarina
