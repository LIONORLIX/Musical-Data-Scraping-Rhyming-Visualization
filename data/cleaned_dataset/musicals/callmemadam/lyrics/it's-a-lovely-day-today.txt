------ It's a Lovely Day Today ------

It's a lovely day today
So whatever you've got to do
You've got a lovely day to do it in, that's true
--- Unknown ---
And I hope whatever you've got to do
Is something that can be done by two
For I'd really like to stay
--- Unknown ---
It's a lovely day today
And whatever you've got to do
I'd be so happy to be doing it with you
--- Unknown ---
But if you've got something that must be done
And it can only be done by one
There is nothing more to say
Except it's a lovely day for saying
It's a lovely day

It's a lovely day today
And whatever I've got to do

--- Unknown ---
But perhaps whatever I've got to do
Is something that can be done by two
If it is then you could stay
--- Unknown ---
It's a lovely day today
But you're probably busy too
So I suppose there's nothing we can do
--- Unknown ---
For if you've got something that must be done
And it can only be done by one
There is nothing more to say
Except it's a lovely day for saying
It's a lovely day

It's a lovely day today
If you've something that must get done
Now don't forget two heads are better than just one
--- Unknown ---
And besides I'm certain if you knew me
You'd find I'm very good company
Won't you kindly let me stay?
