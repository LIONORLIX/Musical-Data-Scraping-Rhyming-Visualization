------ Love Me For What I Am ------

(Trina)
I met a man in a can.
Wouldn't you know he was going my way'
Talked till four, he talked more.
I was afraid I'd turn and say,
--- Unknown ---
'Love me for what I am,
Not what I try to be.
Love me for what I am,
I am someone imperfectly me.'
--- Unknown ---
(Miss Goldberg and Sweetheart)
The lights were low.
Oh, oh...
--- Unknown ---
(Trina)
Don't you know
He gave a phony home address'
Then after weeks, guess who speaks.
'Darling', he says, and I say, 'Yes''
--- Unknown ---
'Love me for what I am,
Not what I try to be.
Love me for what I am,
I am
--- Unknown ---
A person who likes to lie too much,
I try too much
To impress other people.
Often my inferiors.'

We lay in bed, he plays dead,
I play a game with sound and light.
Don't need a quiz, I'm all his.
'Darling', he says, 'We might survive the night-'
