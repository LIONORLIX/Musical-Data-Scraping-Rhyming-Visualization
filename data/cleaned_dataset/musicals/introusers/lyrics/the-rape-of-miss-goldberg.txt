In and out of classes
I always liked the way you got angry in your glasses

Don?t touch my goddamn eyes
You little shit
I?ll throw a fit
I?ll beat your head in with a hammer

Your hands are your hands
Just keep your dirty fingers away from my face kid
That?s the only thing Miss Goldberg demands
--- Unknown ---
Now move

Listen I?m a bastard plumber with a penis
And I mean us two to be together
Teacher yes I do I do
I mean us two to screw together
Me together
You together
