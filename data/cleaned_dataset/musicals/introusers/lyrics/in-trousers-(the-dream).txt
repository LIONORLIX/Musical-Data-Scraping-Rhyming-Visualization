------ In Trousers (The Dream) ------
--- MARVIN ---
Four young ladies sat around and said
They?d never lose their love
And then they lost their love
Five good men in trousers banged a table
And they found their voice
It was a ladies choice
The woman sat to mirror
And whistled through their teeth
They gave directions underneath
On legs and knees
These four young ladies sat around and said
They?d never lose their love
And then they lost their love

Jesse wore a bonnet
May a sash without a dash of charm
And Sis read common wheel
Beth was nervous and she picked
A scab from someone else?s arm
Them Jesse blew her meal
They had a laugh
These women laughed their very best
The men in trousers aren?t impressed
Or else they?re lazy
Four young ladies sat around and said
They?d never lose their love
Four young ladies sat around and said
They?d never lose their love
Four young ladies sat around and said
They?d never lose their love
And then they lost their love

Bah dadah badah dadah
Bah dadah badah dadah
Bah dah dah dah
Bah dadah badah dadah
Bah dadah badah dadah
Bah dah dah dah

Women sit like angels
Men like vultures
It?s a trifle crude
It tends to make one think
Same folk acting like from different cultures
As they chew their food completely out of sync
It?s simply this four women and five men won?t meet
They must for love remain discreet
And who?s to blame them

Jesse works the corner near the drugstore
May?s a souvenir left on the bathroom shelf
Beth wears fragrances like eau de wanting more
While Sis drank beer and went and killed herself
I was a young man once in trousers, one of five
I write to keep the pain alive, but ask no questions
Four young ladies sat around and said
They?d never lose their love
Four young ladies sat around and said
They?d never lose their love
Four young ladies sat around and said
They?d never lose their love
And then they lost their love
--- ALL BUT MARVIN ---
Bah dadah badah dadah

Bah dadah badah dadah
Bah dadah badah dadah
Bah dah dah dah (goes on continuously)

Because they?re dreaming in trousers
Laughing in trousers
Playing in trousers
Making music in trousers
Making movies in trousers
Fighting in trousers
Singing and dancing and lighting in trousers
People waiting in trousers
People crying in trousers
People living in trousers
People screwing in trousers
In trousers
In trousers
