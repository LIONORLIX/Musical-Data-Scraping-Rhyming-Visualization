------ Set Those Sails ------
--- Unknown ---
(Miss Goldberg)
The world is round.
There's a key to every door.
That's what our hero found.
Nothing is for nothing
And a new land is a new land to explore.
--- Unknown ---
Not just paths you retrace,
I'm talking mountains and space.

(Girls)
Hey, I love you.
Set those sails.
A good man never fails.
Hey, I love you.
Set those sails.
A good man never fails.

(Miss Goldberg)
Watch me close,
Close your eyes.
I am living proof that cowards still can rise.
You might tell me you're a victim,
You might get what you deserve,
But I won't excuse,
Boy, I can't excuse,
A boy who's lost his nerve!
--- Unknown ---
Oh lord, set sail.
Be preparing for a fall.
Stay clear of love, and jail.
Lovers don't go hungry
And the appetite of young men counts for all.
--- Unknown ---
Lord, it's rough in the sack.
Kids live and learn to attack.

(Girls)
Hey, I love you.
Set those sails.
A good man never fails.
Hey, I love you.
Set those sails.
A good man never fails.
--- Unknown ---
Hey, I love you.
Set those sails.
A good man never fails.
Hey, I love you.
Set those sails.
A good man never fails.
--- Unknown ---
Hey, I love you.
Set those sails.
A good man never,
A good man never fails!
