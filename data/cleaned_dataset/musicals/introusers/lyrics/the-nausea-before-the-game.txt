------ The Nausea Before The Game ------
--- Unknown ---
(Marvin)
It's the nausea before the game,
And the pain that won't subside in winter.
It's the knees that threaten to go bad,
The body that you thought you had,
That lie.
It's the scores that go unanswered
And unsatisfied.
--- Unknown ---
The growing up, the falling down,
The throwing up, the shame,
The silent prayers, the nausea,
The game.
--- Unknown ---
It's anxiety when you recall
Girls who touch you when you're walking down the hall.
Nausea before the game,
Nausea before the game.
--- Unknown ---
(Girls)
It's the promise of a perfect life,
A perfect house! A perfect wife,
She'll be!
--- Unknown ---
(Marvin)
It's the promise of a perfect star.
Who is me.
--- Unknown ---
(All)
The growing up, the falling down,
The throwing up, the shame,
The silent prayers, the nausea,
The game!
--- Unknown ---
(Girls)
Oh, oh!
--- Unknown ---
(Marvin) (overlapping)
The sneaking in, the passing out,
And where to place the blame!
The dying swans, the nausea,
The game!
--- Unknown ---
(All)
Na-na-na-na-na-na-nausea!
Who do you way ah (I can't figure out this line)
Na-na-na-na-na-na-nausea,
Na-na-na-na-na-na-nausea!

(Marvin)
Hut!
--- Unknown ---
(Girls)
Pray for him!
--- Unknown ---
(Marvin)
Hut!
--- Unknown ---
(Girls)
Pray for us all,
--- Unknown ---
(Marvin)
Hut!
--- Unknown ---
(Girls)
But pray for the boy
With the ball!

(Marvin)
There is something lacking in my play.
There are rules I must not be aware of.
If I touch her breast, would she applaud'
Would she protest, appeal to God,
And weep'
If I touch her, would she let me fall
Asleep'
--- Unknown ---
I touch her eyes, her lips are warm,
Her nose is much the same.
We're waiting for the whistle sound,
She zeroes at my head and turns around,
I hear my name-
--- Unknown ---
(All)
The nausea!
--- Unknown ---
(Marvin)
The game.
