Introducing the world's greatest sharpshooter, Mister! Frank! Butler!
--- Unknown ---
(Butler, singing)
The hour is midnight and all is still
We see the stage coach climbing up the hill,
Moving along the mountain trail, carrying passengers and mail,
never suspecting there is something really wrong
The watchful driver is in his seat,
His trusty rifle lying at his feet
Some of the passengers inside
seem to be dozing as they ride,
never suspecting danger as they roll along
Suddenly there's a shout!
--- Unknown ---
(Company)
What is it all about?
--- Unknown ---
(Butler)
What is it all about? you ask
It's Indians!
--- Unknown ---
(Company)

--- Unknown ---
(Butler)
Very notable, cut-your-throatable Indians!
--- Unknown ---
(Company)
Indians?!
--- Unknown ---
(Butler, Dolly, and Davenport)
Just when they've taken everyone by force,
Who makes an entrance on a big, white horse?
Who starts a-shootin' 'till there's noone left to kill?
--- Unknown ---
(Company)
General Grant?
--- Unknown ---
(Butler, Dolly, and Davenport)
No! Colonel Buffalo Bill!
--- Unknown ---
(All)
Who's got the show that made the Wild West wild?
Who pleases every woman, man, and child?
Who does his best to give the customers a thrill?
