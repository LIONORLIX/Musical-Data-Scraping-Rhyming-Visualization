The cowboys, the wrestlers, the tumblers, the clowns
The roustabouts that move the show at dawn
--- ANNIE OAKLEY ---
The music, the spotlights, the people, the towns
Your baggage with the labels pasted on
--- FRANK BUTLER ---
The sawdust and the horses and the smell
--- ANNIE OAKLEY ---
The towel you've taken from the last hotel
--- ANNIE OAKLEY, FRANK BUTLER and CHORUS ---
There's no business like show business
Like no business I know
Everything about it is appealing
Everything the traffic will allow
No where could you have that happy feeling
When you aren't stealing that extra bow
--- Unknown ---
There's no people like show people
They smile when they are low
Even with a turkey that you know will fold
You may be stranded out in the cold
Still you wouldn't change it for a sack o' gold
Let's go on with the show
Let's go on with the show!
--- ANNIE OAKLEY and FRANK BUTLER ---
They say that falling in love is wonderful
It's wonderful, so they say.
And with a moon up above it's wonderful
It's wonderful, so they tell me.
--- ANNIE OAKLEY ---
I can't recall who said it
--- FRANK BUTLER ---
I know I never read it
I only know that falling in love is grand
--- Unknown ---
And to hold a girl in your arms
Is wonderful,
--- ANNIE OAKLEY ---
Wonderful...
--- ANNIE OAKLEY and FRANK BUTLER ---
In every way
