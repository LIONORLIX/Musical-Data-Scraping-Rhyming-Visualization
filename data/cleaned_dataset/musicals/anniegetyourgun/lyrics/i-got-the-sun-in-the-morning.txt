------ I Got the Sun in the Morning ------
--- ANNIE OAKLEY ---
Got no diamond, got no pearl,
Still I think I'm a lucky girl.
I've got the sun in the morning
And the moon at night.
Got no mansion, got no yacht,
Still I'm happy with what I got.
I've got the sun in the morning
And the moon at night
--- Unknown ---
Sunshine gives me a lovely day,
Moonlight gives me the Milky Way.
Got no checkbooks, got no banks,
Still, I'd like to express my thanks.
I've got the sun in the morning
And the moon at night.
And with the sun in the morning
And the moon in the evening
I'm alright.
--- Unknown ---
Got no butler, got no maid.
Still I think I've been overpaid,
I've got the sun in the morning
And the moon at night.
Got no silver, got no gold,
What you've got can't be bought or sold.
I've got the sun in the morning
And the moon at night.
--- Unknown ---
Sunshine gives me a lovely day,
Moonlight gives me the Milky Way.
Got no heirlooms for my kin,
Made no will but when I cash in
I'll leave the sun in the morning
And the moon at night.
And with the sun in the morning
And the moon in the evening
I'm alright.
--- CHORUS ---
Got no mansion, got no yacht,
Still I'm happy with what I got.
I've got the sun in the morning
And the moon at night.
Sunshine gives me a lovely day,
Moonlight gives me the Milky Way.
--- ANNIE OAKLEY ---
Got no checkbooks, got no banks,
Still, I'd like to express my thanks
--- CHORUS ---
We've got the sun in the morning
And the moon at night.
--- ANNIE OAKLEY ---
And with the sun in the morning
And the moon in the evening
