------ Old Fashioned Wedding ------
--- Frank ---
We?ll have an old fashioned wedding
Blessed in the good old fashioned way
I?ll vow to love you forever
You?ll vow to love and honour and obey
Somewhere in some little chapel
Someday when orange blossoms bloom
We?ll have an old fashioned wedding
An simple wedding for an
Old-fashioned bride and groom
--- Annie ---
I want a wedding in a big church
With bridesmaids and flower girls
A lot of ushers in tailcoats,
Reporters, and photographers
A ceremony with a bishop
who will tie the not and say
Do you agree to love and honour,
Love and honour yes, but not obey
I want a wedding that?s surrounded
By diamonds and platinum
A big reception at the Whaldorf
With Champaign and caviar
I want a wedding like the Vanderbilt?s had
Everything big not small
If I can?t have that kind of a wedding
I don?t want to be married at all.
