------ Girl That I Marry ------
--- FRANK BUTLER ---
The girl that I marry will have to be
As soft and as pink as a nursery
The girl I call my own
Will wear satin and laces and smell of cologne
Her nails will be polished
And in her hair she'll wear a gardenia
And I'll be there
Instead of flittin', I'll be sittin'
Next to her I'm cheerful like a kitten
A doll I can carry,
The girl that I marry must be.

Instead of flittin', I'll be sittin'
Next to her I'm cheerful like a kitten
A doll I can carry,
