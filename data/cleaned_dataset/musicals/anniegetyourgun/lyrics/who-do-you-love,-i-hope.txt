------ Who Do You Love, I Hope ------
--- Unknown ---
I've got the question
I've had it for days
You've got the answer, dear
I'll put the question
In one little phrase
Say what I want to hear
--- Unknown ---
Who do you love I hope
Who would you kiss I hope
Who is it going to be
I hope, I hope, I hope it's me
--- Unknown ---
Who do you want I hope
Who do you need I hope
Who is it going to be
I hope, I hope, I hope it's me
--- Unknown ---
Is it the baker who gave you a cake
I saw that look in his eye
Is it the butcher who brought you a steak
Say that it is and I'll die
--- Unknown ---
Who do you love I hope
Who would you kiss I hope
Who is it going to be
I hope, I hope, I hope it's me
--- Unknown ---
Is it the blondie who acted so shy
I heard the things that she said
Is it the redhead who gave you the eye
Say that it is and your dead
--- Unknown ---
Who do you love I hope
Who would you kiss I hope
Who is it going to be
