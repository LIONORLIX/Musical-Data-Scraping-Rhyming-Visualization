------ Moonshine Lullaby ------
--- Annie ---
Behind the hill
There's a busy little still
Where your Pappy's workin' in the moonlight
--- Unknown ---
Your lovin' paw
Isn't quite within the law
So he's hidin' there behind the hill
--- Unknown ---
Bye bye baby
Stop your yawnin'
Don't cry baby
Day will be dawning
--- Unknown ---
And when it does
From the mountain where he wuz
He'll be coming with jug of moonshine
--- Unknown ---
So count your sheep
Mama's singing you to sleep
With the Moonshine Lullaby
--- Trio ---

Dream of Pappy
Very happy
With his jug of mountain rye
--- Annie ---
So count your sheep
Mama's singing you to sleep
