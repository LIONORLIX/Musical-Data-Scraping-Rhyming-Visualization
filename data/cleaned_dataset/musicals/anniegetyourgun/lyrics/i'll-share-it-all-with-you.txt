------ I'll Share It All With You ------
--- Tommy ---
What is mine dear will be yours
When the sunshines and when it pours
Summer winter fall or spring
Fifty-fifty in ev'rything
Haven't got much even that much to my name
Fortune's door shut can't get in
but just the same
--- Unknown ---
My ear for music, my feet for dancing
My lips for kissing
I'll share it all with you
My sense of humor, my disposition
My rosy future
I'll share it all with you
--- Tommy + Ensemble ---
Someday honey I'll (he'll) have money
You know what that brings
Furs and diamond rings
--- Tommy ---
And besides those things there'll be
My (His) Winnie: ear for music
My (His) Winnie: feet for dancing
My (His) Winnie: lips for kissing
I'll share it all with you
--- Ensemble ---
I'll share it all Woo
I'll share it all Woo
