------ Sunday ------
--- Unknown ---
Now that we're going to be married,
I keep imagining things,
Things that can happen to people,
When they are wearing gold rings:
--- Unknown ---
Being together each morning,
Sharing our coffee and toast.
That's only one of the pictures.
Here's what I picture most.
--- Unknown ---
Sunday, sweet Sunday,
With nothing to do,
Lazy and lovely,
My one day with you.
--- Unknown ---
Hazy and happy,
We'll drift through the day,
Dreaming the hours away.
--- Unknown ---
While all the funny papers lie or fly around the place
I will try my kisses on your funny face.
--- Unknown ---
Dozing, then waking,
On Sunday you'll see...
On...ly... me!
--- Unknown ---
Sunday, sweet Sunday,
On Sunday you'll see...
