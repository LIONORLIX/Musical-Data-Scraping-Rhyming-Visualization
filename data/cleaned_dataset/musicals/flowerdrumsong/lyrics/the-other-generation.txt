------ The Other Generation ------
--- Unknown ---
What are we going to do about
The Other Generation?
How will ever communicate
Without communication?
--- Unknown ---
You can't account for what they'll say or do.
And what peculiar thoughts they think
They never reveal to you.
--- Unknown ---
A very discouraging problem is
The Other Generation.
They want to lead a life that's all their own.
Perhaps we ought to let them,
Forsake them and forget them!
But then we'd only find ourselves alone.--With one another!--
I don't believe we'd like to be alone!
--- Unknown ---
What are we going to do about
The Other Generation?
They never take the blame for one mistake.--Oh no!--
Their parents are responsible
For ev'ry mistake they make!
--- Unknown ---
A very discouraging problem is
The Other Generation.
And soon there'll be another one as well!
And when our out of hand sons
Are bringing up our grandsons,
I hope our grandsons give their fathers hell!--Can't wait to see it!--
