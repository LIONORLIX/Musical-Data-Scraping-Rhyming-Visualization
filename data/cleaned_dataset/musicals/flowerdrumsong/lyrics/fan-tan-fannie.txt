------ Fan Tan Fannie ------
--- Unknown ---
Fan Tan Fanny was leaving her man,
Fan Tan Fanny kept waving her fan,
Said Goodbye, Danny, you two-timing Dan,
Some other man loves your little Fanny, Bye Bye!
--- Unknown ---
In the ice box, you'll find in a can
Some leftovers of Moo Goo Gai Pan.
Fan Tan Fanny has found a new guy.
His name is Manny, He's good for Fanny,
So goodbye Danny, Goodbye!
