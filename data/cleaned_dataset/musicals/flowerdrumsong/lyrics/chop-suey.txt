------ Chop Suey ------
--- Unknown ---
Chop suey, chop suey!
Living here is very much like chop suey.
--- Unknown ---
Hula hoops and nuclear war,
Doctor Salk and Zsa Zsa Gabor,
Bobby Darin, Sandra Dee, and Dewey,
Chop suey, --Chop suey!--
--- Unknown ---
Stars are drifting overhead,
Birds and worms have gone to bed.
Men work late in laboratories,
Others read detective stories.
--- Unknown ---
Some are roaming 'round the country,
Others sit beneath just one tree.
Tonight on TV's Late, Late Show
You can look at Clara Bow! --Who?--
--- Unknown ---
Chop suey, chop suey!
Good and bad, intelligent, mad, and screwy.
Violins and trumpets and drums,
Take it all the way that it comes,
Sad and funny, sour and honey dewy,
Chop suey!
--- Unknown ---
Ballpoint pens and filter tips,
Lipsticks and potato chips.
In the dampest kind of heat wave
You can give your hair a neat wave.
--- Unknown ---
Hear that lovely La Paloma,
Lullaby by Perry Como.
Dreaming in my Maid'nform bra,
Dreamed I danced the Cha-Cha-Cha.
--- Unknown ---
Chop suey, chop suey!
Mixed with all the hokum and bally hooey.
Something real and glowing grand.
Sheds a light all over the land.
--- Unknown ---
Boston, Austin, Wichita, and St. Louey,
Chop suey.
Chop suey, chop suey!
