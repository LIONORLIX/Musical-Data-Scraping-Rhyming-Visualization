------ You Are Beautiful ------
--- Unknown ---
Along the Hwang Ho Valley where young men walk and dream,
A flower boat with singing girls came drifting down the stream.
I saw the face of only one come drifting down the stream.
--- Unknown ---
You are beautiful, small and shy.
You are the girl whose eyes met mine
Just as your boat sailed by.
--- Unknown ---
This I know of you, nothing more,
You are the girl whose eyes met mine
Passing the river shore.
--- Unknown ---
You are the girl whose laugh I heard,
Silver and soft and bright;
Soft as the fall of lotus leaves
Brushing the air of night.
--- Unknown ---
While your flower boat sailed away,
Gently your eyes looked back on mine,
Clearly you heard me say,
