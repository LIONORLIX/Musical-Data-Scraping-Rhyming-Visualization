------ Love, Look Away ------
--- Unknown ---
I have wished before,
I will wish no more.
--- Unknown ---
Love, look away!
Love, look away from me.
Fly, when you pass my door,
Fly and get lost at sea.
--- Unknown ---
Call it a day.
Love, let us say we're through.
No good are you for me,
No good am I for you.
--- Unknown ---
Wanting you so,
I try too much.
After you go,
I cry too much.
--- Unknown ---
Love, look away.
Lonely though I may be,
Leave me and set me free,
