------ Paddle Your Own Canoe ------
--- Unknown ---
I've travelled about a bit in me time, of troubles I've seen a few
I found it far better in every clime to paddle me own canoe
Me wants they are small I care not at all, me debts they are paid when due
I drive away strike from the ocean of life and paddle me own canoe
--- Unknown ---
And I have no wife to bother me life, no lover to prove untrue
The whole day long I laugh with the song and paddle me own canoe
--- Unknown ---
So love everybody, trust only the few as the world I go travelling through
And never sit down with a tear and a frown, but paddle your own canoe
I rise with the lark from daylight to dark, I do what I have to do
I'm careless in wealth, I've only me health to paddle me own canoe
--- Unknown ---
And I have no wife to bother me life, no lover to prove untrue
The whole day long I laugh with the song and paddle me own canoe
--- Unknown ---
It's all very well to depend on a friend, that is if you proved him true
You'll find it better by far in the end to paddle your own canoe
To borrow is dearer by far than to buy, a saying though old still true
You never will sigh if you only will try to paddle your own canoe
--- Unknown ---
And I have no wife to bother me life, no lover to prove untrue
The whole day long I laugh with the song and paddle me own canoe
--- Unknown ---
Though England has ruled our small little land and manys the country too
Just take my advice and never think twice to paddle your own canoe
It's better I say to make your own way as the world you go travelling through
You never will sigh if you only will try to paddle your own canoe
--- Unknown ---
And I have no wife to bother me life, no lover to prove untrue
