------ I Dismiss You ------
--- GRACE ---
You are not a man,
You don't have a spine,
Ready to surrender
And put Ireland in chains
Whoring's made you soft
Drink has left you weak
Not a drop of Irish blood
Is left within your veins
--- Unknown ---
You and all your lies,
I've borne all that I must
I can see you clear;
You're a dead weight in a war,
A disgrace to the clan
Near a hundred things more,
What you're not is man!
--- Unknown ---
Get up!
Jesus Christ!
--- DONAL ---
I've had enough of this,
Woman, hold your whist!
Woman, well not quite,
That's always been the joke;
What is the trouble here?
Basic'lly the gist
Is I can't go on being
Married to a bloke
--- Unknown ---
Yes, love, it's true
You've been adm'rably taught
Yes, I'll admit,
You're an ace at your trade,
You're a half-decent shot,
Fairly skilled with a blade...
But a woman you're not!
--- GRACE ---
My father up above,
His very word you flout!
--- DONAL ---
Boots, swords,
And trousers
I've been the
patient one!
--- GRACE ---
Has it been three years?
I can still walk out!
--- DONAL ---
I draw the line,
If you cross it, then
--- GRACE AND DONAL ---
We're done!
--- DONAL ---
You took my rightful place
Through the mad dying words
of a senile old man
--- GRACE ---
Now you've fin'lly said
What is unforgivable
--- Unknown ---
Every day
Discrediting
--- DONAL ---
Every day
regretting
--- BOTH ---
The bargain that we made
--- GRACE ---
Never did I
Have a doubt
--- DONAL ---
Not a doubt ever
--- BOTH ---
That this would
Come to be
--- GRACE ---
Poisonous
And pitiful
--- DONAL ---
Poisoned,
Perverted,
--- BOTH ---
The tune you asked be played
--- GRACE ---
Someone has to
pay the piper;
--- DONAL ---
Someone must
pay up, dear
--- BOTH ---
Better you than me
--- GRACE ---
No!
As allowed me, by our Irish laws,
I say to you now...
I dismiss you!
I dismiss you!
I dismiss you!
--- MEN ---
Stay away from Grania,
You don't matter any more
Hang your sword up, go below - you've
Nothing else to do
Soon as we get into port
We dump you on the shore
Unity of clans is over
All because of you...
All because of you...
All because of you...
