------ Enemy At Port Side ------
--- MAJELLA ---
Grania, Captain
Things look bad
We've English sailors
Come on board!
Donal, Ma'am
The Man's a traitor
Holy God!
Protect us Lord!
Donal, yes, your husband
Wants us to surrender!
--- GRACE ---
Quickly now, I need my sword!
--- MAJELLA ---
No Grania. You can't; you can't move! You are too weak.
--- GRACE ---
I must go up there.
--- MAJELLA ---
No Grania you can't.
--- GRACE ---
Majella, give me my sword.
--- MAJELLA ---
No, you can't.
--- GRACE ---
Give me my sword.
