------ I'll Be There ------
--- Unknown ---
What Do I Say?
What Do I Do?
How Will I Ever Hope To Fare?
How Can I Stay
So Close To You
Knowing Now That Your Place Is
In Another's Embraces,
In Another Man's Care?
--- Unknown ---
I Should Be Gone
Far From This Hell
Till Not A Trace Of You Survives
Yet I'll Stay On
For I Know Well
Though You've Left Me Behind You
One Day Troubles Will Find You
And When That Day Arrives
--- Unknown ---
I'll Be There
For To Me There's No Sorrow
Worse To Bear
Than A Life Lived Apart.
I'll Be There
Come The Mists On The Morrow
I'll Be There
By Your Side
And Deep WIthin Your Heart
--- Unknown ---
He'll Keep His Wife
Dressed Up In Bows
Lavished Eternally With Flow'rs.
But Whatever Life
He Might Propose
Will Be Merely Pretending
To The Dream Never-Ending
That WIll Always Be Ours.
--- Unknown ---
I'll Be There
Though I Know That It's Madness,
Heart Laid Bare,
Stripped Of Pride, Yet Still Proud.
I'll Be There
In The Depths Of My Sadness
I'll Be There
Ever Steeled
Unyielding And Unbowed.
--- Unknown ---
Go And Marry A Man You Don't Love
If That Pleases You.
Throw Away, For A Cause,
All The Joys We Have Known
I Thought Love's More Than Faith,
More Than Clan, More Than Anything
Let His Kiss Keep You Warm
I'll Be Fine On My Own...
--- Unknown ---
Is It Me I'm Deceiving?
--- Unknown ---
Mad Or Not, I'll Stay True.
I'll Be There...
--- Intrumental Measures ---
--- Unknown ---
I'll Be There, Heaven Speed Me,
By Your Side, As You Need Me
