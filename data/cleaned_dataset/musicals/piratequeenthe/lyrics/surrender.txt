------ Surrender ------
--- Unknown ---
Here I stand,
No crown, no land
And yet prepared to tender
My unconditional surrender
To pledge my plight, to reunite
A mother and her son.
--- Unknown ---
This woman you chained,
This woman I love
Know just how brave she can be
And don?t shed a tear, not for me
Her own need is to embrace
A son who?s never seen her face.
--- Unknown ---
And so it is my turn has come,
As ever her defender
With joy as heart I surrender.
Chain me now and set her free
To heed her young sons? ball
--- Unknown ---
Let me trade my life for hers
