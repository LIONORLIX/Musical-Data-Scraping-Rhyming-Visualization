------ Sail To the Stars ------
--- EVLEEN ---
Seol chun farriage
Go Flaitheas de agus
Glor ne heireann
Seol, seol leat
Doite sa tine
O eirigh in eineach le dia
O seol go samh le dia
Chun na realta...
--- ALL ---
Sail to the stars
Off to glory, God
And the grace of Ireland
Go on your way
To your journey's end
In a veil of fire
--- Unknown ---
A chieftan dies
A chieftan's born
As hearts are torn
A new light shines
Upon the morn...
--- Unknown ---
And sail to the stars
Off to glory, God
And the grace of Ireland
Go on your way
To your journey's end
In a veil of fire
And take your place
In Heaven's light
Upon this night...
--- Unknown ---
Go forth to the dawn
In the years ahead
They will tell the tale
Of you, of us all
On this night
