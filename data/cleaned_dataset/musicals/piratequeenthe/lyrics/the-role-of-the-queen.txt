------ The Role Of the Queen ------
--- LADIES ---
White...
--- ELIZABETH ---
The white of virgin skin
Unblemished, powedered, blank
That hides what lies within
The image crowned with
--- ELIZABETH AND LADIES ---
Gold...
--- ELIZABETH ---
The color of my power
The scepter and the orb
Demands of state that flower
My anger flowing
--- ELIZABETH AND LADIES ---
Red...
--- ELIZABETH ---
Blood, lips, and blushing cheeks
This body made of flesh
Confining even me
--- LADIES ---
White, gold, red...
--- ELIZABETH ---
This fortress I create
Made from these pots of paint
No longer serves as it was meant to be
--- Unknown ---
I stand divine
As the monarch clear
Yet on every side
Thund'ring words I hear:
It's time that she
Wed a consort King
To produce an heir
Is in fact the role of the Queen
--- LORDS AND LADIES ---
She stands divine
As the sov'reign soul
Placed by God Himself
In her royal role
In a child, they say,
--- Unknown ---
Crown and flesh convene
--- Unknown ---
To postpone that day
Has become the goal of the Queen
--- ELIZABETH ---
I love my new map.
Knowing better the topography of Ireland.
We've made great advances in the East.
But...
Why is it in the West
I am consistently defied by this...
Female!!!
--- BINGHAM ---
Not for much longer. Things are going according to plan, your majesty.
Soon we'll see the end of this so-called Queen of the
Pirates, this trousered pretender, this aberration of her sex.
--- ELIZABETH ---
This is your last cha-a-a-a-nce!
--- BINGHAM, LORDS AND LADIES ---
She stands divine
As the sov'reign soul
Placed upon the throne
By the hand of God
In sacrifice
She remains serene
In her ev'ry breath
