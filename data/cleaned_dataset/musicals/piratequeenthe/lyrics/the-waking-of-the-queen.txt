------ The Waking Of the Queen ------
--- ELIZABETH ---
Yesterday they crowned my head,
Anointed me as Queen
The girl that I once was is dead
And what is here
Must never be ... seen
--- Unknown ---
Bring our robes
As we leave bed
Do not look, not once,
or it's your head!
--- Unknown ---
Each day at dawn when I choose to arise
For one moment I'll stand here revealed:
Something female men crave and despise
Which must now be concealed
--- Unknown ---
Men in England think a female can't rule
They think women lack the masculine will to lead
If my sex distracts them - I am no fool
