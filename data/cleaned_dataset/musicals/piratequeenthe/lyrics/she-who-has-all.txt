------ She Who Has All ------
--- ELIZABETH ---
What does she have I don't have?
What does she know I
don't know?
I who have all,
I have nothing
compared
to the dreams she holds fast
in her heart
ever so...
--- GRACE ---
What can I do I don't
do?
What can I bear I
don't bear?
Chained in a cell,
stripped of all that I've
known.
In my heart, in my hope,
I have more
than is there
--- Unknown ---
I will carry on.
I will not bow down to
them,
I will survive for the
day
When I see once more
both the man I love
and the child I bore...
I who have naught, I
have all...
--- ELIZABETH ---
I who have all, I have
naught...
--- GRACE ---
I standing humbled and
small...
--- ELIZABETH ---
I who hold nations in
thrall...
--- GRACE ---
All that I've lived
--- GRACE/ELIZABETH ---
Only now do I see
that a woman in love,
it is she,
who has all.
--- Unknown ---
All that I've lived,
only now do I see
that a woman in love,
it is she,
who has all.
