------ The Choice Is Mine ------
--- DUBHDARA ---
All the clans of Ireland
Are bogged down in ancient fueds
--- DONAL ---
Like the feuds your kinsmen once began
--- Unknown ---
CHIEFTAN O'FLAHERTY
Donal!
--- DUBHDARA ---
Yes! And so the Queen of England
Sees us and concludes
We're too weak to fight her empire's plan
--- Unknown ---
And so my friend, we must put old claims asside
And join as one, a course that's never been tried
--- Unknown ---
CHIEFTON O'FLAHERTY
We must, but how?
That would call for trust
No trust have I
--- DUBHDARA ---
Nor I
--- Unknown ---
CHIEFTON O'FLAHERTY
You know, as I,
How this work is done
You have a daughter,
And I have a son
These two must wed
And when there's an heir
Then two warring clans
Will at last be one
--- GRACE ---
Father, I know well what kind of victory this shows
Tell me, was my fate just sealed for me?
If you do accept this marriage union they propose
I must give up Tiernan and the sea
I fought so hard
--- DUBHDARA ---
You are selfless in war
--- GRACE ---
To carve a life that's mine
--- DUBHDARA ---
Give yourself like a man
--- GRACE ---
I love my land
--- DUBHDARA ---
But this fight calls for more
--- GRACE ---
Where Do I draw the line?
--- DUBHDARA AND GRACE ---
Who'll sacrifice
To become one clan?
--- DUBHDARA ---
A man cannot
A woman can
--- GRACE ---
Tiernan; please!
The choice is mine
But I cannot refuse
It's cruel, the path
We are now forced to choose
--- TIERNAN ---
In the name of God!
This you cannot do!
--- GRACE ---
Tiernan - this must be
But my love still is you
--- TIERNAN ---
Grace! You promised yourself to me! Does that mean nothing to you?
--- DUBHDARA ---
Tiernan, it must be so.
--- GRACE ---
In this time of war
Two small lives must yield
--- Unknown ---
Tiernan!
--- Unknown ---
Our clan accepts -
