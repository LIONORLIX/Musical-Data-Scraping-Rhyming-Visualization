------ Once I Was Loved ------
--- Unknown ---
Once I was loved,
I knew I was loved.
I flew through my days
In fanciful ways,
Secure and sure there'd always be
Endless love for me.
Gone is that love.
My fanciful dove
Has tears in her eyes,
She no longer flies.
And yet, my heart will not despair
For it's there,
Just a memory away.
Once I was loved, so always come what may,
Love's happy memory
