------ The Stepsisters' Lament ------
--- Unknown ---
Why would a fellow want a girl like her?
A frail and fluffy beauty?
Why can't a fellow ever once prefer
a solid girl like me?!
--- Unknown ---
She's a frothy little bubble
with a flimsy kind of charm
And with very little trouble
I could break her little arm!
--- Unknown ---
Oh oh why would a fellow want a girl like her?
So obviously unusual?
Why can't a fellow ever once prefer
a usual girl like me?!
--- Unknown ---
Her face is exquisite I suppose,
but no more exquisite than a rose is.
Her skin may be delicate and soft
but not any softer that a doe's is.
--- Unknown ---
Her neck is no longer that a swan's
She's only as dainty as a daisy
She's only as graceful as a bird...
So why is the fellow going crazy?
--- Unknown ---
Oh why would a fellow want a girl like her,
A girl who's merely lovely?
Why can't a fellow ever once prefer
a girl who's merely me?!
--- Unknown ---
She's a frothy little bubble
with a frilly sort of air
and with very little trouble
I could pull out all her hair!! Haha ha ha!
--- Unknown ---
Why would a fellow want a girl like her,
a girl who's merely lovely?
Why can't a fellow ever once prefer
a girl who's merely me?
--- Unknown ---
What's the matter with the man?
What's the matter with the man?
