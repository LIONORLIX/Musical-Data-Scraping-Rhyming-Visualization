------ All Girl Band ------
--- Unknown ---
It was one of those days
When your minds in a maze
I was trapped in the doubt of my life
--- Unknown ---
I was doing a quiz
Found in Cozmo or Ms.
When the music went out of my life
--- Unknown ---
But I?m not the type to face the blues alone
So I dusted off my flute
And slide trombone
--- Chorus ---
I joined an all girl band
Now I jam from the night til? the morn
I joined an all girl band
Now I can blow my own horn
--- Unknown ---
I was fed up with rules
And the room full of fools
And the office was driving me nuts (I hear ya girl, I know what ya mean)
--- Unknown ---
And I needed some peace
Or at least a release
Or I kick in their if?s, ands and  butts
--- Unknown ---
But Id rather punch my clock and not my boss
And Id run home to become Diana Ross
--- Chorus 2 ---
I joined an all girl band
Now the feeling is just what I need
I joined an all girl band
From now on I?m singing the lead
--- Unknown ---
Were shaking our maracas
Were making news, making music that?s rhythm and blues
Together were much better than so-so
Each of us is a virtuoso
--- Unknown ---
I was hitting the skids
I was sick of my kids
Discontented to just be a wife
--- Unknown ---
If I spend one more day
With that damn PTA
I will drown in the carpool of life
--- Unknown ---
So we gave up playing mah john, bridge and gin
Now I play the bass guitar and violin
--- Chorus 3 ---
We joined an all girl band
Now the music inside of us sings
We joined an all girl band
Now look whose pulling the strings
--- Chorus 4 ---
We joined an all girl band
Now the harmony soars to the night
We joined an all girl band
Alice is doing all right
--- Spoken ---
A my name is Alice and my husbands name Alan and we live in Alabama and we sell apples
--- Unknown ---
A my name is Alice and my ex?s name is Albert and I live in Albuquerque and I get alimony
--- Unknown ---
A my name is Alice and I work as an attorney for Applebaum,
Bemshik and Cohen, and do I have anxiety.
--- Unknown ---
A my name is Alice and I live in an apartment,
and I live in it alone, and its kind of antiseptic
and my boyfriends an accountant and he?s kind of antisocial, and I wanted
to be an actress but I couldn?t get an agent so I sell Avon.
--- Unknown ---
A my name is Alice and my husbands name is Adam,
and his girlfriends name is Amy,
and my lovers name is Abby now her husbands name is Arney,
and his boyfriends name is Alan,
my analysts name is Arthur and we?re working on my anger.
--- Chorus 5 ---
We joined an all girl band
Now the harmony soars to the night
We joined an all girl band
Now I can blow my own horn,
Now on I?m singing the lead
Now look whose pulling the stings
Alice is doing all right
