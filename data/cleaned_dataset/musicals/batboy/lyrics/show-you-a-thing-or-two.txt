BAT BOY: I will discuss Copernicus who ruined all our fun,
And showed we're just a ball of dust that limps around the sun.
Which brings me then to Darwin, when he bent us out of shape
As he began to prove that man is nephew to an ape.
We were annoyed when Doctor Freud declared it's not a soul,
It is your blind subconsious mind that's always in control.
But I submit that any twit if he had eyes to see,
Can seize his fate; self-educate; and turn out just like me!
