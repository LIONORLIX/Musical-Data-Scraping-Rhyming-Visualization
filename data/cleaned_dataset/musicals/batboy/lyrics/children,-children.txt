PAN: Children, welcome home
To where we all began.
Alone and face to face
Let us erase the fall of man:
--- Unknown ---
Let the frogs pause in their song,
Let the crickets hold their breath,
Let the trees stand still as death
And tell the mosquitoes not to bite.
Now we've been hoping for so long,
So fill the sky with fireflies.
So they can see into each other's eyes
And then they'll get it right...
--- Unknown ---
Oh, Children, Children don't be scared!
The moon is up and we're all prepared!
Children, take a look around-
We're on sacred ground!
And what we thought we lost at last is found.
--- Unknown ---
Now let the turtle and the dove

ALL: Let the song go on for weeks and weeks
To bless this boy and bless this bride!

Oh, Children, Children
Don't be scared! The moon is up and we're all prepared!
Children, take a look around, hear that joyful song!
For what we thought was lost at last is found.
Sha la la la la la!
The Earth's asleep, time to wake it.
If you have clothing, forsake it.
We want you breathless and naked.
Choose your mate; And then let's see what we create!
HEY!

PAN: Draw near, my dearly beloved,
No preist, No church- but what of it?
Take root, take flight, I command it!
Here we stand-
ALL: Here we stand!
PAN: So no more stalling- take her hand!
Oh, Children, Children
ALL: Children!
PAN: Don't be scared.
ALL: Don't be scared!

PAN: The moon is up and
ALL: -We're all prepared!
Children, take a look around

PAN: We're on sacred ground, and hear that joyful sound!
For what we thought was,
ALL: What we thought was lost at last is found!
Found!
Found!
FOUND!
