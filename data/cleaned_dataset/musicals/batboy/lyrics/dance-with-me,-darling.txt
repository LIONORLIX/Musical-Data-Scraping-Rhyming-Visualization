We have to let him live. I'm begging you. As your wife.
--- DR PARKER ---
You haven't been a wife to me in years.
--- MEREDITH ---
I could be.
--- DR. PARKER ---
... Tonight?
--- MEREDITH ---
Uh...
--- DR PARKER ---
Tonight?
--- MEREDITH ---
... Let me get you a drink dear.

DR PARKER
But there was a time, you know,
When you would dance with me,
Once long ago,
There was love in your eyes.
You were so light in my arms,
We danced five hours or more,
We were the last on the floor,
With the soon still to rise...
The band played one final song,
And you were humming along:
--- Unknown ---
Oh, dance with me, darling
we haven't danced since I don't know when.
--- Unknown ---
(spoken)
Do you remember that song Meredith?
--- Unknown ---
(sang)
Dance with me, darling,
Won't you embrace me?
Kiss me in case we don't meet again.
I've heard a rumour,
Barely a whisper,
Claiming that we were through.
So dance with me, darling
Show them that it's not true.

(spoken)
MEREDITH
So you'll do it?
--- DR PARKER ---
So you'll do it?
--- MEREDITH ---
Yes
--- Unknown ---
DR PARKER [To Bat Boy]
Did you hear that?
I guess that makes us pals
--- Unknown ---
(sang)
'Cause now I can't say no,
Tonight she smiled at me:
I just goes to show,
Someone up there still cares.
I prayed this day would arrive,
When she'd return to my arms;
Now if I keep you alive,
I can join her upstairs.
I see a way to proceed
So we both can get what we need.
Oh:

THE VOICES IN DR. PARKER'S HEAD
Dance with me, darling
Doo dooby doo doo
Doo dooby doo...
--- DR. PARKER ---
Dance with me, darling
La da da da da,
Da da da da da, da da, da da
--- Unknown ---
Oh dance with me, darling
Da da da da da
Da da da da da
Da da da da
--- Unknown ---
Surely it's more than moonlight and music
Surely it's more than wine.
--- DR. PARKER AND VOICES. ---
So dance with me, darling,
Show them that you're still mine!...
--- Unknown ---
[Dr Parker cuts the throat of the goose and pours the blood into a bowl.
He forces Bat Boy's head into the bowl, making him
drink deeply. Lightning. Thunder.]
--- VOICES ---
Ah ah ah ah ah ah,
Ah ah ah ah ah ah...
