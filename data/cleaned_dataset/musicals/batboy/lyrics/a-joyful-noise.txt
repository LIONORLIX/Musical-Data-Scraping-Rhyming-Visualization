REV.HIGHTOWER: Now, I know there's somebody out there. Someone who needs healing. I can feel your distress! You've got a
sin... within. Step forward! Let the holy ghost heal you! He's putting a fire under your seat now. No fear. Who wants the
healing?

BAT BOY: I want to be healed!

REV.HIGHTOWER: Sweet wounded Jesus.

LET ME WALK AMONG YOU/JOYFUL REPRISE
--- Unknown ---
BAT BOY: I know you hate me. But if you could only see me the way I see all of you...
--- Unknown ---
Look at all your faces. Children, husbands, wives.
God, you're all so beautiful. I envy you your lives.
Going to work, building your schools, throwing a football
or swimming in pools.
Out in the sun, living by rules, I could learn how if you'd teach me the tools...
I know I'm strange, so help me change, please.
--- Unknown ---
Let me walk among you. Let me show my face.
I could learn to live with you, I can earn my place.
I will move a mountain; your wish is my command.
And some day you may want to shake my hand.
--- Unknown ---
I will paint your houses. I'll milk your cows at dawn.
I will do your laundry and I will mow your lawn.
Let me file your taxes. I am a CPA!
And maybe then you'll shake my hand someday.
I can grow a champion rose, or teach a yoga class.
I myself designed these clothes. I can do my part.
Must I die then with my nose still pressed against the glass?
But if you'd shake my hand, well, thats a start.
Yes, thats a start. Look in your heart!
--- Unknown ---
And let me join your carpool- No! Let me drive the car!
Let me throw a barbeque or join you at the bar.
Come and watch the ballgame, I'll bake a pecan pie!
And I will shake your hand when you drop by.
Oh, bring me to your churches and met me look inside,
Bring me to your weddings and let me kiss the bride!
--- Unknown ---
Thank you all for listening... thats... all I had to say.
--- Unknown ---
But please will someone shake my hand?
Won't somebody take my hand?
Let just one person shake my hand!
--- Unknown ---
ALL: Okay
BAT BOY: Okay?
ALL: Okay!
BAT BOY: Okay?
ALL: Okay!
BAT BOY: Okay?
ALL: OKAY!
Praise God, the sheep has returned to the fold.
And the prodigal son has come in from the cold!
--- Unknown ---
BAT BOY: So like the prophets were told
--- Unknown ---
ALL: In the days of old! Make a joyful noise, my soul!
Make a joyful noise, my soul!
--- Unknown ---
BAT BOY AND ALL: Make some noise! (Make some noise!)
Make some noise! (Make some noise!)
Hallelujah- my soul is whole!
Sing it loud! (Sing it proud)
Sing it strong- all night long!
--- Unknown ---
ALL: Make a joyful noise- a joyful noise my soul!
A joyful noise my soul!
A joyful noise my soul!
A joyful noise-
my soul!
