------ Bohemian Rhapsody ------
--- Galileo ---
Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head
Pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
--- Unknown ---
Mama, ooo
Didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on, as if nothing really matters
--- Scaramouche ---
Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine
My body's aching all the time
Goodbye everybody - I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
--- Galileo ---
Mama, ooo
--- Chorus ---
Anyway the wind blows
--- Galileo ---
I don't want to die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all
--- Khashoggi ---
I see a little silhouetto of a man
--- Chorus ---
Scaramouche, scaramouche will you do the fandango
Thunderbolt and lightning - very very frightening me
--- Unknown ---
Galileo
--- Galileo ---
Galileo
--- Chorus ---
Galileo
--- Galileo ---
Galileo
--- Chorus ---
Galileo figaro magnifico
--- Galileo ---
I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me
--- Chorus ---
He's just a poor boy, from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity
--- Galileo ---
Easy come, easy go
Will you let me go
--- Chorus ---
Bismillah! No, we will not let you go
Bismillah! We will not let you go, let him go
Bismillah! We will not let you go
--- Galileo ---
Let me go
--- Chorus ---
Will not let you go
--- Galileo ---
Let me go
--- Chorus ---
Never let you go
--- Galileo ---
Let me go
--- Unknown ---
Never let me go
--- Chorus ---
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
--- Galileo ---
Oh mama mia, mama mia
--- Chorus ---
Mama mia let me go
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me
For me, for me
--- Killer Queen ---
So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye
So you think you can love me and leave me to die
--- Chorus ---
Oh baby, can't do this to me baby
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here
--- Galileo ---
Nothing really matters
--- Scaramouche ---
Anyone can see
--- Galileo ---
Nothing really matters
Nothing really matters to me
