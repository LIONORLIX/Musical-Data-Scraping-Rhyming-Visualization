------ Crazy Little Thing Called Love ------
--- Brit ---
(They did it for their babies, of course!
They did it for a crazy little thing called love! Oh yeah!)
--- Unknown ---
This thing called love I just can't handle it
--- Meat ---
This thing called love I must get round to it
--- Brit ---
I ain't ready
--- Both ---
Crazy little thing called love
--- Meat ---
This thing (this thing)
Called love (called love)
It cries (like a baby)
In a cradle all night
--- Brit ---
It swings (woo woo)
It jives (woo woo)
It shakes all over like a jelly fish
--- Both ---
I kinda like it
Crazy little thing called love
--- Brit ---
There goes my baby
She knows how to rock 'n' roll
She drives me crazy
She gives me hot and cold fever
She leaves me in a cool cool sweat
--- Unknown ---
Oh yeah
--- Unknown ---
I gotta be cool, relax, get hip
And get on my tracks
Take a back seat, hitchhike
Take a long ride on my motorbike
Until I'm ready
Crazy little thing called love

I gotta be cool, relax, get hip
And get on my tracks
--- Scaramouche ---
Take a back seat
--- Galileo ---
Hitchhike
--- Scaramouche ---
And take a long ride on my motorbike
--- All ---
Until I'm ready
Crazy little thing called love
--- Unknown ---
This thing called love I just can't handle it
This thing called love I must get round to it
I ain't ready
--- Unknown ---
Crazy little thing called love
Crazy little thing called love
Crazy little thing called love
Crazy little thing called love
Crazy little thing called love
Crazy little thing called love
Crazy little thing called love
Crazy little thing called love
