------ Innuendo ------
--- Unknown ---
While the sun hangs in the sky and the desert has sand
While the waves crash in the sea and meet the land
While there's a wind and the stars and the rainbow
Till the mountains crumble into the plain
--- Unknown ---
Oh yes we'll keep on tryin'
Tread that fine line
Oh we'll keep on tryin yeah
Till the end of time
Till the end of time
