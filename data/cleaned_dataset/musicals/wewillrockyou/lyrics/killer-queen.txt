------ Killer Queen ------
--- Yes Things ---
She keeps her Moet et Chandon
In her pretty cabinet
'let them eat cake' she says
Buying on the internet
A built-in remedy
For Kruschev and Kennedy
At anytime an invitation
You can't decline
--- Unknown ---
Caviar and cigarettes
Well versed in etiquette
Extraordinarily nice
--- Unknown ---
She's a Killer Queen
Gunpowder, gelatine
Dynamite with a laserbeam
Guaranteed to blow your mind
Anytime
Ooh, recommended at the price
Insatiable an appetite
Wanna try?
--- Killer Queen ---
To avoid complications
I never keep the same address
In conversation
I email like a baroness
Met a man from China
Went down to Geisha Minah
But then again incidentally
If you're that way inclined
--- Unknown ---
Perfume came naturally from Paris
For cars I couldn't care less
Fastidious and precise
I'm a Killer Queen
--- Unknown ---
(She's a Killer Queen)
Gunpowder, gelatine
Dynamite with a laser beam
Guaranteed to blow your mind
Anytime
--- Killer Queen ---
Drop of a hat I'm as willing as
Playful as a pussy cat
Then momentarily out of action
Temporarily out of gas
To absolutely drive you wild, wild..
