------ Another One Bites the Dust ------
--- Killer Queen ---
Hey!
--- Unknown ---
She walks warily down the street
With her brim pulled way down low
Ain't no sound but the sound of her feet
Machine guns ready to go
--- Unknown ---
Are you ready, are you ready for this
Are you hanging on the edge of your seat
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
To the sound of the beat
--- Unknown ---
Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
And another one gone and another one gone
Another one bites the dust, eh
Hey, I'm gonna get you too
Another one bites the dust
--- Unknown ---
How do you think I'm going to get along
Without you when you're gone
I took you for everything that you've got
And kicked you out on your own
--- Unknown ---
Are you happy? Are you satisfied?
How long can you stand the heat
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
To the sound of the beat
--- Unknown ---
Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
And another one gone and another one gone
Another one bites the dust
Hey, I'm gonna get you too
Another one bites the dust
--- Unknown ---
Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust, hey hey
Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
--- Unknown ---
There are plenty of ways that you can hurt a man
And bring him to the ground
You can beat him
You can cheat him
You can treat him bad and leave him
When he's down, yeah
But I'm ready, yes I'm ready for you
I'm standing on my own two feet
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
Repeating to the sound of the beat
--- Unknown ---
Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
And another one gone and another one gone
Yes, another one bites the dust
Hey, I'm gonna get you too
Another one bites the dust
--- Unknown ---
Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust, hey hey
Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
