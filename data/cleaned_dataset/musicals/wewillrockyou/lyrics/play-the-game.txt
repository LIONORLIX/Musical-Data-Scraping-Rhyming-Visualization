------ Play the Game ------
--- Killer Queen ---
Open up your mind and let me step inside
Rest your weary head and let your heart decide
It's so easy when you know the rules
It's so easy all you have to do is fall in love
Play the game
Everybody play the game of love
--- Unknown ---
When you're feeling down and your resistance is low
Take a cyber-shopping trip and let yourself go
Give me your life
Don't play hard to get
It's a free world
All you have to do is fall in love
Play the game
Everybody play the game of love
--- Unknown ---
My game of love has just begun
Love runs from my head down to your toes
My love is pumping through your veins
Driving you insane
Come, come, play the game
Play the game, play the game, play the game
--- Unknown ---
This is your life - don't play hard to get
It's a free free world
All you have to do is fall in love
Play the game
Everybody play the game of love
