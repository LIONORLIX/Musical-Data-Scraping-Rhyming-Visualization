------ No-One But You ------
--- Meat ---
--- Unknown ---
A hand above the water
An angel reaching for the sky
Is it raining in Heaven
Do you want us to cry
--- Unknown ---
And everywhere the broken-hearted
On every lonely avenue
No one could reach them
No one but you
--- Unknown ---
One by one
Only the good die young
They're only flying to close to the sun
Life goes on
Without you
--- Unknown ---
Another tricky situation
I get to drowning in the blues
And I find myself thinking
What would you do?
--- Unknown ---
Yes, it was such an operation
Forever paying every due
Hell, you made a sensation (sensation!)
You found a way through (found a way through)
--- All ---
And one by one
Only the good die young
They're only flying too close to the sun
--- Meat ---
We'll remember, forever
--- Unknown ---
And now the party must be over
I guess we'll never understand
The sense of your leaving
Was it the way it was planned?
--- Unknown ---
And so we grace another table
And raise our glasses one more time
There's a face at the window
And I ain't never, never saying goodbye
--- All ---
One by one
Only the good die young
They're only flying too close to the sun
--- Meat ---
Crying for nothing
Crying for no one
