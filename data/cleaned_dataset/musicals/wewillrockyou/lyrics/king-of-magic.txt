------ King of Magic ------
--- Killer Queen ---
One dream, one soul
One prize, one goal
One golden glance of what should be
--- Yes Things ---
It's a kind of magic
--- Khashoggi ---
One shaft of light that shows the way
No mortal man can win the day
--- Yes Things ---
It's a kind of magic
--- Khashoggi ---
The bell that rings inside your mind
Is challenging the doors of time
--- Killer Queen ---
The waiting seems eternity
The day has dawned of sanity
--- Unknown ---
Is this a kind of magic?
--- Yes Things ---
It's a kind of magic
--- Both ---
There can't be only one
This reign will last a thousand years
We will live on
--- Killer Queen ---
This flame that burns inside of me
I'm hearing secret harmonies
--- Yes Things ---
It's a kind of magic
--- Killer Queen ---
There rings a bell inside your mind
--- Both ---
We're challenging the doors of time
--- Yes Things ---
It's a kind of magic
It's a kind of magic
--- All ---
This is (this is) a kind (a kind) of magic (yeah)
There can't be only one
This - - - - that - - - - a thousand years
Will soon be done
