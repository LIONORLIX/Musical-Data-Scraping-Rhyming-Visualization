------ I Want It All ------
--- Brit ---
Adventure seeker on an empty street
Just an alley creeper, light on his feet
A young fighter screaming, with no time for doubt
With the pain and anger I can't see a way out
--- Unknown ---
It ain't much I'm asking, I heard him say
Gotta find me a future move out of my way
I want it all, I want it all, I want it all, and I want it now
--- Both ---
I want it all, I want it all, I want it all, and I want it now
--- Meat ---
Listen all you people, come gather round
I'm gonna get me a game plan
Gonna shake you to the ground
But just give me what I know is mine
People do you hear me, just gimme the sign
--- Unknown ---
It ain't much I'm asking, if you want the truth
Here's to the future hear the cry of youth
--- Both ---
I want it all, I want it all, I want it all, and I want it now
--- Unknown ---
I want it all, I want it all, I want it all
--- Meat ---
And I want it now!
--- Brit ---
I'm a man with a one track mind
So much to do in one lifetime
--- Unknown ---
People do you hear me
--- Meat ---
Not a man for compromise
--- Unknown ---
And wheres and whys and living lies
--- Brit ---
So I'm living it all
--- Meat ---
Yes I'm living it all
--- Brit ---
And I'm giving it all
--- Meat ---
And I'm giving it all
--- Both ---
I want it all, I want it all, I want it all, and I want it now
I want it all, I want it all, I want it all, and I want it now
I want it all, I want it all, I want it all, and I want it now
I want it all, I want it all, I want it all, and I want it
I want it, I want it, I want it now
