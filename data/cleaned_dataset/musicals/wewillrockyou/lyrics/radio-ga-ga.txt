------ Radio Ga Ga ------
--- Teachers and Kids ---
We sit alone and watch your light
Our only friend, through teenage nights
And everything we want to get
We download from the internet
--- Unknown ---
No need to think, no need to feel
When only cyberspace is real
It makes us laugh
It makes us cry
It makes us feel like we can fly
--- Unknown ---
Hope to record our life online
Touch any key, the world is mine
We're lost in space
But we don't care
Without your light our world's not there
--- Unknown ---
Complete control, you are the power
Our lives are programmed by the hour
Globalsoft (Globalsoft)
--- Unknown ---
All we hear is radio Ga Ga
Video Goo Goo
Internet Ga Ga
All we hear is cyberspace Ga Ga
Marketing Blah Blah
--- Unknown ---
Always something new
Globalsoft, all your world loves you
--- Unknown ---
We watch our shows
We watch your stars
Across our screens for hours and hours
We hardly need our eyes or ears
We just log on and dreams appear
--- Unknown ---
We're not alone
We have our friends
On cyber love we can depend
So stick around cos we'd all miss you
We need our graphics
Need our visual
--- Unknown ---
Complete control, you are the power
We use our lives up by the hour

Always something new
