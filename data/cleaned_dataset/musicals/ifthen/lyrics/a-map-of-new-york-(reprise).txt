------ A Map Of New York (Reprise) ------
--- Unknown ---
With everything that you've built
The plans you've drawn
All of those fears that held you back are gone
Isn't there nothing left to prove?
Isn't it time to think of moving on?

You don't want to let yourself get stuck the way you do
So let's make a brand-new map
