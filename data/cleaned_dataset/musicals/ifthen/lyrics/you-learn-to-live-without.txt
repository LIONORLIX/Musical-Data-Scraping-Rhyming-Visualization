------ You Learn to Live Without ------
--- Unknown ---
You learn to take your coffee black
You learn to drink your whiskey neat
You learn to take your shower cold
And sleep on tired feet
--- Unknown ---
You learn to order dinner in
You learn to send the laundry out
You learn to amuse yourself
--- Unknown ---
You learn to live without
--- Unknown ---
You tell yourself you’re rich at last in money and in time
You draw a bath and then unplug the phone
You pour yourself a Pinot Clo Du Val 2003
You sit a spell a queen upon her throne
You go to bed alone
--- Unknown ---
You learn to fall asleep alone
You learn to silence ticking clocks
You learn to turn the shades at night
And double check the locks
--- Unknown ---
You learn to speak so calmly when
Your heart would like to scream and shout
You learn to smile and breathe and smile
--- Unknown ---
You learn to live without
--- Unknown ---
You find the coat and tie you thought you’d given to good will
You stumble along a long lost set of chess
You see him there in corners and in closets and on shelves
And truth be told you’d like to see him less
--- Unknown ---
You stumble through the morning but you waken for the day
You tell yourself that all is going well
But now and then a sense of loss just slams you in the chest
You know that no one else can really tell
You make it all seem swell
--- Unknown ---
You learn to count the quiet winds
An hour with no unprompted tears
And not to count the deadly days
As they fade into years
--- Unknown ---
You learn to stand alone at last
So brave and bold and strong and stout
You learn to somehow like the dark
You even love the doubt
You learn to hold your life inside you
And never let it out
You learn to live and live and die and live
--- Unknown ---
You learn to live without
You learn to live without
You learn to live without
