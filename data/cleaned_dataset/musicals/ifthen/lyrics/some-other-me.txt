------ Some Other Me ------
--- Unknown ---
Somewhere there's a world where you and I are man and wife
We have a child, or three
And it's just fine with me
To love that life
--- Unknown ---
And somewhere there's a world where from the first we never met
We never spoke, or kissed
We don't know what we missed
Or don't know yet
--- Unknown ---
And I didn't go to Vassar, but to Smith or Yale or Brown
I ended up in Boston or some small Alaska town
To practice law or neuter cats or fish the Bering Sea
Those lives are lived somewhere
By some other me
--- Unknown ---
Some other me is homeless
Some other me is queen
Some other me has seen things that no other me has seen
If I met her, I would ask her
That one question we both fear
Some other me, how did we end up here?
--- Unknown ---
Somewhere there's a me who never loved that other you
Who liked you fine, I guess as buddies, more or less
And that would do
--- Unknown ---
And somewhere there's a you who simply worshiped other me
And we were wild and hot and all the things we're not
And we were free
--- Unknown ---
And somewhere I'm the president with plans that never fail
And somewhere I'm a rebel king, and somewhere I'm in jail
I didn't chase my glory days long after they were done
I found myself a woman, or a man, and had a son
--- Unknown ---
Some other me's a rockstar
Some other me's still cool
Some other me does not feel like some tired old fool
--- Unknown ---
And you and I are strangers
Or we're lovers
Or we're not
The other me's live with what they've got
--- Unknown ---
Look down each road left untaken
Trace every turn and twist
The lives that we just let go by
The dreams we might have missed
--- Unknown ---
Now we're old enough to know that
One road ends where one begins
The moment where the what-might-be's turn into might-have-beens
--- Unknown ---
Somewhere there's a world where you and I can still be friends
Not like we were, not yet
We forgive, but don't forget
