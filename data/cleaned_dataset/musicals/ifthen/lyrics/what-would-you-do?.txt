------ What Would You Do? ------
--- Unknown ---
If you met him tomorrow and knew you would lose him
If you saw him and saw all the hurt you would know
Would you hold him while you had him
Or let him go?
--- Unknown ---
If you knew that your laughter would not last forever
But you knew while it did you would breathe it like air
Would you let him make you love him
Would you dare?
Feeling like you feel today
Tell me you'd just walk away
--- Unknown ---
What would you do if you could do it all over?
What would you do if you could start it all new?
If you could go back knowing what you know now
