------ What If? (Reprise) ------
--- Unknown ---
You stop and say hey to a stranger
And where will it lead, who can know
But you learn how to love the not knowing
So here I go
Here I go
Here I go
--- Unknown ---
You choose and then everything changes
Take a breath and then fly off the cliff
And you know that there's no turning back
No turning back
No turning back
--- Unknown ---
And you wonder what if?
