------ The Moment Explodes ------
--- Unknown ---
The engine stops, the plane drops, the moment explodes
A sudden rush, a rude hush, and the moment explodes
The moment explodes
--- Unknown ---
Into thoughts of all the things I've left undone
And flashes from a life I've just begun
Every friend I ever knew or thought I did
The love that I could give, the love I hid
--- Unknown ---
Every stupid life before your eyes, cliche
Could I please go out some less expected way?
But now I'm alive or dying, crack those codes
When the moment explodes
--- Unknown ---
Staircase dips, the foot trips, the moment explodes
The dark world curves, the car swerves, and the moment explodes
And the moment explodes
--- Unknown ---
It reaches to the future and the past
To every moment ever, first or last
And every life I reached, I could not touch
And everyone I loved, or loved too much
--- Unknown ---
And every chance I took or did not take
Connections that I made or did not make
But I'll never take those turns to other roads
Once the moment
When the moment
When the moment
