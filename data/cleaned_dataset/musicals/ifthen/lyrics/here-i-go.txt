------ Here I Go ------
--- Unknown ---
I'm not one for fortunes
Or wishing on a star
And I've studied all the stories
what our chances are
Then my heart starts beating faster
And it makes this disaster worse by far
Still here I go
Oh here I go
--- Unknown ---
Now I know all the motions
And the steps to every dance
And I count cards at the table
I never bet on chance
I leave nothing to the gods
I know all the odds and evens so
Still here I go
Oh here I go
Why I don't know
Oh here I go
--- Unknown ---
You're not some romantic
You know that's no surprise
And you're no good at small talk
Or little loving lies
--- Unknown ---
I'm awkward ungrateful
And sometimes I'm hateful
as you know
--- Unknown ---
Still here we go
--- Unknown ---
Oh here we go
--- Unknown ---
You know deep down I'm a coward
Afraid to let you in
But the only thing more frightening
Is to say what might have been
So here I go
Oh here I go
I love you so
--- Unknown ---
So here I go
