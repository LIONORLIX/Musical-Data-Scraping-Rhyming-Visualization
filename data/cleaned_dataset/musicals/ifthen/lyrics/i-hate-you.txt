------ I Hate You ------

I hate you
I know
I love you
I know
Don't go
Liz
I know
--- Unknown ---
I won't be anywhere near the action, I'll be in some air-conditioned tent miles from everything.
--- Unknown ---
I hate you
I hate you
I love you
I hate you
Don't do it
I need you
Forget it, I know you
My God, how I hate you
Don't leave me, I love you
Don't say that you love me
'Cos what does it matter?
You're going to leave me
So leave me, whatever
It's not like I need you
I need you
Don't leave me
You know I'm not selfish
But me, me, me, I, I, I
Need you to stay
Okay
--- Unknown ---
In my life I haven't made that many promises
Just one to them, and one to you
And you know me like no one has known me before
And so you know what I have to do
And no matter what you say
You want me to
--- Unknown ---
Let's look at this calmly
Discuss how I hate you
The ways that you've hurt me
Though really you haven't
You're clearly about to
Don't touch me!
I hate you
Just leave us, whatever
We'll get on without you
I'm tough and resourceful
I'm steady and sturdy
And freaking the fuck out
I love you
I hate you
So screw you
You're making me crazy
So go!
--- Unknown ---
Wait
No!
--- Unknown ---
In my life, I've always said I don't need anyone
I like our life and I love you
And I swore that I'd love without wanting or needing you
But it's too late
I need you, too
--- Unknown ---
You're the reason I think this life might not be meaningless
You're my North Star, my map to grace
You're my single best decision in a life of many awful ones
My one big yes, my one embrace
With you I never feel I'm out of place

We believe the insurgents intended the RPG attack to reflect the maximum casualties in the medical facility. Your husband was working his second shift that day. The CO wanted you to know the number of lives that he saved on this deployment...
--- Unknown ---
Goddammit, you did it
I knew you would do it
You asshole
I hate you
I totally blame you
And really, how could you?
I hate you
I hate you
I hate that I hate you
I hate that I love you
I love you
I loved you
I loved you
I lost you
I hate you
Goddamn you
You asshole
You motherfucker!
--- Unknown ---
In my life, I haven't made that many promises
Just one to him, Now to you two
That I will never let this world take me away from you
I brought you both here
I'll see you through
Whatever comes, whatever I must do
It's me and you
It's me and you
It's me and you
