------ Best Worst Mistake ------
--- Unknown ---
You can guard your heart forever
Keep it safe and keep it sound
But love won't feel so heavy
If you spread that shit around
--- Unknown ---
What is it that you're afraid of?
Being hurt, let down, destroyed
Well you know, it all can happen
And there's more you can't avoid
--- Unknown ---
You're a die-hard, you're a radical
A fighter through and through
So tell me why you're so afraid of a cause that's new
And true
Like me and you
--- Unknown ---
So man up, break out, dive in
There's no knowing how it ends
Until you got up and begin
--- Unknown ---
Climb in, breathe deep, hold on
You can't know how good it gets
'Til you go or 'til it's gone
--- Unknown ---
Be lost, be wary, be afraid
But don't hideout in the dugout while that final game is played
Make that trade
I'll be the best worst mistake you ever made
--- Unknown ---
Really? Sports metaphors?
Really.
--- Unknown ---
It's not that I don't love you
'Cos I don't not love you
And I'd lie to say I'm never sometimes always thinking of you
--- Unknown ---
But when something's deeply felt
It seems shallow just to say
The thing that's expected
The same dull cliche
--- Unknown ---
Like you're so sweet
You're so fine
You're the one
Please be mine
--- Unknown ---
'Cos you're in love
Love's a bitch
Love's a queen
Love's a witch
Love is joy
Love's a boy
I love you
I love you
For all time
For all time
--- Unknown ---
You tricked me into saying that.
--- Unknown ---
It's too late, it's done, you're through
'Cos I said it, and you said it
And I know you meant it, too
--- Unknown ---
So man up
Break out
Dive in
There's no knowing how it ends
Until at last we both begin
--- Unknown ---
We're lost, we're lonely, we're afraid
But the sun will still be shining
When we come out of the shade
--- Unknown ---
?
I'll be the best worst mistake you ever made
I'll be the best worst mistake you ever made
