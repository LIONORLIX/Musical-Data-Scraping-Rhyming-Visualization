------ You Never Know ------
--- Unknown ---
You never know how badly this could go
I've got disaster written on my cheek
The odds are I'm some two-faced lying freak
Who will whisper pretty things and leave you flat
And steal your cat
It might not be that bad
But even so
You never see the worst that things can be
You think you do because you've been hurt before
Another hurt might hurt you that much more
And odds are I will do what most men do
And hurt you too
Cuz men are men and odds are odds
Although, you never know
You may think you know the end at the beginning
But the truth is, there's no mortal way to tell
And the game's not over till the final inning
And I'm grinning cuz this game might just end well
You never know
If I only want your dough
I might be on the lamb or on the dole
Off my meds or off my nut or on parole
Or even worse, I might be someone who
Is meant for you
And maybe that's the thing to lay you low
You never know
If I'm drunkard or a dullard
Too callous or too clever
Or if I might just be the man
Who's meant to be with you forever
You never know
