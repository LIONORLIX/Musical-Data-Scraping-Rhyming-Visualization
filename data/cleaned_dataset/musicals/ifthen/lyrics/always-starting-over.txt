------ Always Starting Over ------
--- Unknown ---
In my life I never thought I'd get a second chance
I thought I was done then I met you
And though I never dreamed I could learn how to love again
I placed my bet and you came through
I somehow still lost, somehow always do
This time feels new
--- Unknown ---
Thank you for finding me
Thank you for the care
Fuck you for making me think that this life might be fair
You promised to love me
A promised you kept
And I won't be sorry that you said to leap and I leapt
I won't regret what I did then
Though it hurts more than I could imagine back when
All the same even so I would love you all over again
--- Unknown ---
(Chorus)
Am I always starting over in a brand new story
Am I always back at one after all I done
Cause I burned all of my bridges
and learned every last lesson too
So how can I start new
--- Unknown ---
I love our children, both fiercely and well
When they ask about you
Well Lordy the stories I'll tell
And I won't regret the lives I didn't lead
I knew you, I loved you
Let that be all that I need
Say that it's fate, say it's foretold
I'm through with fighting and I'm much too old
What the Gods have to give I'll take and I'll live and be bold
--- Unknown ---
(Chorus)
If we're always starting over every brand new morning
Then we're always starting out with the end in doubt
We can leave life to tomorrow
Or grieve all that we thought we do
Or make each moment new
--- Unknown ---
(Bridge)
All that has happened is happening now
All that might happened is here somehow
All of the choices that made me me
All the accidents yet to be
All that's ahead and all that's behind
It's all in the moment I make up my mind
And open my heart, I'm scarred and start
--- Unknown ---
(Chorus)
Cause we're always starting over every life we're living
Yes we're always just awake every step we take
And my love our life is over but love I'll make one last vow
To start over and over and over somehow
