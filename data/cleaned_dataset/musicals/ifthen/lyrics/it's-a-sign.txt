------ It's a Sign ------
--- KATE ---
Yesterday this woman met this man in Madison Park
Quite by chance, all at random, as it were
But they met again just now
In this tunnel in the dark
Could mere chance have caused these two things to occur?
Or could there be another meaning to infer?
Could the universe have a message for him and her?
--- Unknown ---
You meet a man who is handsome and nice
Quite by chance one day
But then you meet that same handsome man twice - enticing!
That's not chance, no way
--- Unknown ---
The universe has a message for you
And if you're smart, then you'll let it through
Just a gentle shout, signal from above
It's plain to see, it's meant to be
You're destined for love
--- Unknown ---
It's a sign
Oh, it's a sign
Like when clouds open up or the stars align
It's a sudden smile, a nice surprise
So act just like those wisest guys
And follow that North Star and you'll be fine
It's a sign
--- Unknown ---
People? Who's read their signs today?
--- Unknown ---
SUBWAY PASSENGER #1
Today a pigeon shit right on my head
It's still in my hair
--- Unknown ---
SUBWAY PASSENGER #2
The Virgin Mary appeared in my bread, I said
That's her face right there!
--- Unknown ---
SUBWAY PASSENGER #3
I found a sandwich right here on the floor
Now those are signs that you can't ignore
--- KATE ---
It's perfect and it's plain
And rainbows in the rain
One more clue, there for you
Do I have to explain
That it's a sign?
--- Unknown ---
Oh it's a sign
Like the leaves in your tea or the cork in you wine
It's a ladies wink, a poet's rhyme
A train door opened just in time
It isn't just some handsome stranger's line
It's a sign
--- Unknown ---
It's a blue moon on a Monday night
A blue moon on a late-night flight
Patterns in your latte cup
Buttered bread falls butter-up
When a stray dog comes to stay
When a black cat walks your way
That tingle in your fingers, too
Means something good is here for you
--- Unknown ---
Oh it's a sign
Oh it's a sign
--- KATE & PASSENGERS ---
Like when clouds open up or the stars align
--- KATE ---
Read your tea leaves just in case
Read the wrinkles on your face
They're telling you, your life is on the line
The Galaxy has got your grand design
It's perfect, it's profound, it's divine
It's divine
It's divine
