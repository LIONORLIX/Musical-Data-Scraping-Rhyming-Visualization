A Day In Falsettoland,
Dr. Mendel At Work.

(Caroline)
You go out on the streets,
And there are all these people asking for a handout!
You go home, you open up your mail,
And it's full of people asking for a donation!
And you turn on the TV and they want money for starving children in Ethiopia!
I just want to be left alone!
--- Unknown ---
(Mendel) (overlapping) (singing)
I don't get it!
I don't understand!
In the 60s, everyone had heart.
In the 60s, we were all a part of the same team.
In the 60s, we had a new world to start!
Could this- oh God, don't say this-
Could this be the new world we started'
Here I sit, brokenhearted and-
--- Unknown ---
(Caroline) (speaking)
Do I wait for the promotion, or do I take this IBM job'
--- Unknown ---
(Mendel)
Yeah, well, Caroline' Hmm.
I don't get it!
I've been left behind,
Half my patients, yuppie pagans
Modeled on the Ronald Reagans!
Now the world is too pathetic,
And I don't get it at all!
--- Unknown ---
(Caroline) (speaking)
Oh, I'm in a deep quandary about my career.
What do you think I should do'
--- Unknown ---
(Mendel)
Time's up.
--- Unknown ---
(Caroline)
Awww.
--- Unknown ---
(Mendel) (singing)
At least there's Trina at home,
Trina in bed,
Trina obsessing and sort of caressing
My head with her feet.
I once thought it was sweet,
But I don't anymore.
Now I just snore,
--- Unknown ---
Cause I'm so exhausted,
Listening as those yuppie farts complain,
Listening as their shallow hearts explain
Their lives.
--- Unknown ---
(Charlotte) (speaking)
Trina Works It Out.
--- Unknown ---
(Trina) (singing)
Marvin's back with Whizzer,
Just like how it was.
If I don't like Whizzer,
It's because my ex sure does.
--- Unknown ---
Why should that affect me'
Sometimes I'm a lout.
Mendel serenades and Jason calms me.
Why should I be wilting
When their precious love is not in doubt'
Work it out!
--- Unknown ---
(Jason)
The Neighbors Relax!
--- Unknown ---
(Cordelia)
How was your day at the hospital'
--- Unknown ---
(Charlotte)
Unbelieveable!
What is that smell'
--- Unknown ---
(Cordelia)
Nouvelle bar mitzvah cuisine!
I've been practicing cuisine bar mitzvah nouvelle.
Well'

It was terrible.
Did you hear that Marvin's back with Whizzer'
Marvin's back with Whizzer!
--- Unknown ---
(Mendel)
Drop it, sweetheart.
Give it up, you know I love you.
Honey, sweetheart, what's the matter'
I don't get it.
Why don't you let go'
--- Unknown ---
(Trina)
After the first mile, I'll be OK.
I cannot let go until we have this bar mitzvah.
--- Unknown ---
(Mendel)
Isn't it enough I want you every night'
--- Unknown ---
(Trina)
Heh.

(Cordelia)
How was your day at the hospital'
--- Unknown ---
(Charlotte)
It was wonderful.
For the first time in months, nobody died.
There were just heart attacks and gallstones,
Light bulbs up the ass,
Fake appendicitis, which is gas,
Which I diagnosed. People overdosed
And I saved them.
--- Unknown ---
I save the young people, old people,
One priest and one high school principal!
Saving lives, I feel invincible!
Yes, I do!
--- Unknown ---
Do you know how great my life is'
Do you know how great my life is,
Saving lives and loving you'
--- Unknown ---
(Cordelia)
You save lives and I save chicken fat,
I can't fucking deal with that!
--- Unknown ---
(Charlotte)
Do you know how great my life is'
--- Unknown ---
(Cordelia)
Yes, I know how great your life is.
--- Unknown ---
(Charlotte)
Do you know how great my life is'
--- Unknown ---
(Cordelia)
Yes, I know how great your life is.
Do you know how great my life is,
--- Unknown ---
(Cordelia)
Yes, I know how great-
--- Unknown ---
(Mendel and Trina) (overlapping)
Everything will be alright.
Everything will be alright.
Everything will be alright.
--- Unknown ---
(Charlotte)
Saving lives

(Charlotte and Cordelia)
And loving you.

(Marvin and Whizzer are playing racquetball)
--- Unknown ---
(Whizzer)
It bounced twice.
--- Unknown ---
(Marvin)
No, it didn't.
--- Unknown ---
(Whizzer)
Once, then twice.
You know it did.
--- Unknown ---
(Marvin)
That's not nice.
--- Unknown ---
(Whizzer)
No, it isn't,
But you're a pain in the ass!
--- Unknown ---
(Marvin)
You're a beast, but at least
When you play me, you win.
--- Unknown ---
(Whizzer)
You give up.
--- Unknown ---
(Marvin)
I perspire.
--- Unknown ---
(Whizzer)
Where's the heat' Where's the fire'
It used to be you'd desire a fight,
So fight!

--- Unknown ---
(Whizzer)
Something stinks in how you play.
--- Unknown ---
(Marvin)
Don't you think it's a blessing
I'm so pathetically bad'
--- Unknown ---
(Whizzer)
Just stay back, sir, with force.
I'll attack and, of course,
I will win! Just give in to bliss
And kiss!

(Marvin)
Let's go!
Do you know all I want is you'
Anything you do is alright!
Yes, it's alright!
