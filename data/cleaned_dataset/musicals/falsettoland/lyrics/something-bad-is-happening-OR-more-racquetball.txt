------ Something Bad Is Happening / More Racquetball ------
--- Unknown ---
(Charlotte)
People might think I'm very dykish.
I make a big stink when I must, but goddamn!
I'm just professional, never too nonchalant.
If I'm a bitch, well, I am what I am!
--- Unknown ---
Just call me 'Doc', don't call me 'lady'.
I don't like to talk when I'm losing the game.
Bachelors arrive sick and frightened.
They leave weeks later unenlightened.
We see a trend, but the trend has no name.
--- Unknown ---
Something bad is happening.
Something very bad is happening.
Something stinks, something immoral.
Something so bad that words have lost their meaning!
Rumors fly and tales abound,
Stories echo underground!
Something bad
Is spreading, spreading, spreading
'Round!
--- Unknown ---
(Cordelia)
Tell me how it tastes!
Tell me if it's good!
Tell me, dear, if you'd like seconds-

(Cordelia)
You're feeling very sick inside, I can tell.
And it's something I cooked. (Charlotte laughs)
I just knew how you looked.
Look what I've done to my doctor.
--- Unknown ---
She's my doctor,
And I love her!
She's got passion!
She's intelligent and, Jesus Christ,
A doctor!
Very wealthy,
And I love her!
Doctor of internal medicine!
I'm sorry that you're queasy.
--- Unknown ---
(Charlotte)
I'm uneasy.
--- Unknown ---
(Cordelia)
She's got something on her mind that makes her nervous.
--- Unknown ---
(Charlotte)
This is fucking ridiculous! (Cordelia laughs)
--- Unknown ---
(Cordelia)
She's my doctor and I love her!
She's got heart!
--- Unknown ---
(Charlotte) (overlapping)
I scan the mag, very chic tabloid.
The men dressed in drag, next to their moms.
Fashion and passion and filler,
But not a word about the killer.
I like the ballgowns, but Jesus Christ!

She ate the food and she got sick!
Oh, woe is me, oh, woe is me!

Anything you do is alright.
Yes, it's alright.
