They always yell,
Isn't that unfortunate'-
When Marvin's here.
Everyone's yelling about the bar mitzvah.
It's not a wrestling match,
Why are they sweating'
It's not a funeral,
What's so upsetting'

It's a celebration
Where I get presents.
But everybody's yelling and everybody's ruining it,
Everybody's ruining it.
--- Unknown ---
It's a celebration
Where I get richer.
But everybody's yelling and everybody's ruining it,
Everybody's ruining it.

Why, oh, why'
What have I done that they'd ruin my bar mitzvah?
