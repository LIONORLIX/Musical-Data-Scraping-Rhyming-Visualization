Whizzer, kid, you're looking very good today.
You had to see yourself a few days back,
I had a heart attack!

But today you seem to be
On the way to recovery!
Oh, Whizzer, I want to applaud!
It's days like this I almost believe in God,
Days like this I almost believe
In God.

In a kosher morass!
For aches and croup,
Try my chicken soup!

Just like on our second date.

I hyperventilate.
But since I'm parking in the city, I've improved,
Or else the hydrants moved! (Trina laughs)
Yeah, go ahead, be good and pissed.

Gee, you look awful.
