Baruch atoh adonai,
Baruch atoh adonai elohenu,
Meluch haolum.

(Trina)
Jason dear, hello.
Are you packed and waiting?
But before we go,
Let me talk with father alone.
--- Unknown ---
Now as the bar mitzvah nears-
Jason, put your walkerman on and hum.
Since this is the last loving thing we?ll probably ever do together,
Let?s act adult and not go crazy.
--- Unknown ---
(Marvin)
Have you chosen yet who?ll cater?
--- Unknown ---
(Trina)
What about it?
--- Unknown ---
(Marvin)
I know a person who can cater.
Can we consider who?s gonna cater?

(Trina) (overlapping)
It?s a personal opinion who should cater.
Shh!

Please?

(Mendel)
Stop! This is so much crap,
Throw a simple party!
Religion?s just a trap
That ensnares the weak and the dumb.
Stop with the prayers.
--- Unknown ---
(Trina)
How can you ?stop with the prayers? at a bar mitzvah?
--- Unknown ---
(Mendel)
The whole thing?s voodoo,
And I know more than you do!
--- Unknown ---
(Marvin and Trina)
This is the year of Jason?s bar mitzvah!
We?re more excited than we should be.
This is the year of the child
When he spreads out his wings!
There?s music in his heart!
His life?s about to start!
His body?s going wild!
My child?
--- Unknown ---
(Marvin)
My child?
--- Unknown ---
(Trina)
Our child.
--- Unknown ---
(Mendel)
Children, please.
Throw the kid a celebration and relax.
I?ll bring women from the wrong side of the tracks.
We?ll have a ball!
I guess I?ll have to raise this Jason myself.
--- Unknown ---
(Marvin)
Isn?t he annoying?
--- Unknown ---
(Trina)
Yes, he is.
--- Unknown ---
(Marvin)
Isn?t he too much?
--- Unknown ---
(Trina)
Yes, but so are you.
Really, kiddo, so are you.
--- Unknown ---
(Marvin)
Jesus, he?s annoying!
Jason, where?s my hug?
--- Unknown ---
(Trina)
Where?s my hug?
--- Unknown ---
(Mendel) (overlapping)
My own bar mitzvah was
A miserable occasion,
The cause for such abrasion in my family!
It still gives me hives!
--- Unknown ---

This is the year for Jason?s bar mitzvah,

Food that?s from the heart!
