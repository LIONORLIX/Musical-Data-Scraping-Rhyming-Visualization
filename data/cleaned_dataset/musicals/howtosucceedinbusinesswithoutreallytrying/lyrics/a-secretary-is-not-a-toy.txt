------ A Secretary Is Not A Toy ------
--- BRATT ---
Gentlemen! Gentlemen!
--- Unknown ---
A secretary is not a toy,
No my boy;
Not a toy to fondle and dandle
And playfully handle
In search of some puerile joy.
No, a secretary is not,
Definitely not a toy.
--- 3 MALES ---
You're absolutely right, Mr. Bratt!
We wouldn't have any other way, Mr. Bratt!
It's a company rule, Mr. Bratt!
--- MALE ENSEMBLE ---
A secretary is not a toy,
No my boy,
not a toy.
--- Unknown ---
So do not go jumping for joy,
--- MALE ENSEMBLE ---
Boy! A secretary is not...
A secretary is not,
A secretary is not ...a toy,
--- FEMALE ENSEMBLE ---
A secretary is not to be
Used for play therapy.
--- COMPANY ---
Be good to the girl you employ, boy;
Remember, no matter what
Neurotic trouble you've got,
A secretary is not ...a toy.
--- Unknown ---
She's a highly specialized key
Component of operation unity...
A fine and sensitive mechanism
To serve the office community
With a mother at home
She supports.
--- FRUMP ---
And you'll find nothing like her at F.A.O. Schwartz!
--- SMITTY ---
A secretary is not a pet,
Nor an erector set.
--- FRUMP & SMITTY ---
It happened to Charlie McCoy, boy!
They fired him a shot
The day the fellow forgot
A secretary is not... A toy!
--- COMPANY ---
A secretary is not...A toy!
--- Unknown ---
And when you put it to use,
Observe,
When you put her to use:
--- FRUMP ---
That you don't find the name Lionel
on her caboose!
--- FEMALE ENSEMBLE ---
A secretary is not a thing
One buy key, hold by string
--- Unknown ---
Her pad...
Is to write in,
And not spend the night in
If that's what you plan to enjoy.
No!
--- COMPANY ---
The secretary you got,
Is definitely not
Employed to do a gavotte,
Or you know what,
Before you jump for joy,
Remember this my boy,
A secretary is not,
