------ I Believe In You ------
--- FRUMP ---
Hello, Executive Washroom. Oh! Come on down. We're here making plans.
--- COMPANY ---
Gotta stop that man.
I've gotta stop that man cold
Or he'll stop me.
--- Unknown ---
Big deal, big rocket,
Thinks he has the world in his pocket.
Gotta stop, gotta stop.
Gotta stop that man.
--- FRUMP ---
Now! Look at him standing and staring at himself on the mirror!
--- FINCH ---
Now there you are.
Yes, there's that face.
That face that somehow I trust.
It may embrace you, too.
Here me say it.
But say it I must,
Say it I must
--- Unknown ---
You have the cool clear
Eyes of a seeker of wisdom and truth,
--- Unknown ---
Yet, there's that up turned chin
And the grin of impetuous youth.
--- Unknown ---
Oh, I believe in you,
I believe in you.
--- Unknown ---
I hear the sound of good
Solid judgment whenever you talk.
--- Unknown ---
Yet, there's the bold, brave spring
Of the tiger that quickens your walk.
--- Unknown ---
Oh, I believe in you,
I believe in you.
--- Unknown ---
And when my faith in my fellow man
Oh but falls apart,
I've but to feel your hand grasping mine
And I take heart,
I take heart.
--- Unknown ---
To see the cool clear
Eyes of a seeker of wisdom and truth,
--- Unknown ---
Yet with the slam, bang, tang
Reminiscent of gin and vermouth.
--- Unknown ---
Oh, I believe in you,
I believe in you.
--- MALE ENSEMBLE ---
Gotta stop that man.
Gotta stop that man.
--- Unknown ---
Or he'll stop me.
--- Unknown ---
Big will, big beaver
For we won't live in front of this fever
--- Unknown ---
Gotta stop, gotta stop.
Gotta stop that man.
--- FINCH ---
Oh, I believe in you...
--- COMPANY ---
Don't let it be such a hero
--- FINCH ---
You...
You...
You!
--- COMPANY ---
Gotta stop that man!
Gotta stop him!
Stop that man!
Gotta stop him!
