------ Happy To Keep His Dinner Warm ------
--- ROSEMARY ---
New Rochelle, New Rochelle
That's the place where the mansion will be,
For me and the darling bright young man,
I picked out for marrying me.
--- Unknown ---
He'll do well.
I can tell.
So it isn't a moment to soon
To plan on my life in New Rochelle,
The wife of my darling tycoon.
--- SMITTY ---
Honey, you'll be a New Rochelle. Your darling tycoon will be here in the office.
The future Mrs. Finch is in for some lonely nights.
--- ROSEMARY ---
Smitty, I'm prepared for exactly that sort of thing...
--- Unknown ---
I'll be so happy to keep his dinner warm.
While he goes onward and upward.
Happy to keep his dinner warm
'Till he comes wearily home from down town.
I'll be there,
--- Unknown ---
Waiting until his mind is clear,
While he looks through me,
Right through me.
Waiting to say
Good evening dear,
I'm pregnant
What's new with you,
From down town?
--- Unknown ---
I ought to be loved, by a man
I respect,
To bask in a glow
Of his perfectly, understandable neglect.
I ought to belong in the aura on his frown,
Darling busy frown.
Such heaven!
--- Unknown ---
Wearing the wifely uniform
While he goes onward,
And upward.
--- Unknown ---
Happy to keep his dinner warm,
'Till he comes wearily home
