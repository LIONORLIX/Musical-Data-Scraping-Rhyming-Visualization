------ The Company Way ------
--- MR. TWIMBLE ---
When I joined this firm
As a brash young man.
Well I said to myself not brash young man.
Don't get any ideas.
Well, I stuck to that
And haven't had one in years.
--- FINCH ---
You play it safe!
--- MR. TWIMBLE ---
I play it the company way.
Wherever the company puts me
There I stay.
--- FINCH ---
But what's your point of view?
--- MR. TWIMBLE ---
I have no point of view!
--- FINCH ---
Supposing the company thinks that...
--- MR. TWIMBLE ---
I think so too!
--- FINCH ---

--- FINCH ---
Your face is a company face...
--- MR. TWIMBLE ---
