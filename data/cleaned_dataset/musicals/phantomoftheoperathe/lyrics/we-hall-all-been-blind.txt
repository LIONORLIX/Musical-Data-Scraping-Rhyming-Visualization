------ We Hall All Been Blind ------
--- Raoul ---
We have all been blind and yet the answer is staring us in the face.
This could be the chance to ensnare our clever friend.
--- Firmin and Andre ---
We're listening. Go on.
--- Raoul ---
We shall play his game, perform his work, but remember we hold the ace.
For if Ms. Daae sings, he is certain to attend.
--- Firmin/Andre ---
We are certain the doors are barred.
We are certain the police are there.
--- Raoul ---
We are certain they're armed.
--- Firmin/Andre/Raoul ---
The curtain falls, his reign will end.
--- Christine (speaking) ---
Raoul I'm frightened. Don't make me do this. It scares me.
Don't put me through this ordeal by fire.
He'll take me. I know. We'll be parted forever. He won't let me go.
What I once used to dream, I now dread. If he finds me it won't ever end.
And he'll always be there singing songs in my head.
He'll always be there singing songs in my head.
--- Raoul ---
You said yourself he was nothing but a man,
yet while he lives he will haunt us 'til we're dead.
--- Christine ---
Twisted every way, what answer can I give?
Am I to risk my life to win the chance to live?
Can I betray the man who once inspired my voice?
Do I become his prey? Do I have any choice?
He kills without a thought. He murders all that's good.
I know I can't refuse, and yet I wish I could.
Oh God, if I agree what horrors wait for me, in this, the Phantom's opera?
--- Raoul ---
Christine, Christine don't think that I don't care,
but every hope, and every prayer rests on you now.
--- Phantom ---
Seal my fate tonight. I hate to have to cut the fun short.
