Firmin:(Spoken)
Monsieur Andre!
--- Firmin ---
Dear Andre, what a splendid party
--- Andre ---
The prologue to a bright new year
--- Firmin ---
Quite a night, I'm impressed
--- Andre ---
Well, one does one's best
--- Andre and Firmin ---
Here's to us
--- Andre ---
A toast to all the city
--- Firmin ---
I must say all the same it is a shame that phantom fellow isn't here!
--- Chorus/Crowd ---
Maquerade! Paper faces on parade
Masquerade! Hide your face so the world will never find you
Masquerade! Every face a different shade
Masquerade! Look around, there's another mask behind you.
--- Unknown ---
Flash of mauve
Splash of puce
Fool and king
Ghoul and goose
Green and black
Queen and priest
Trace of rouge
Face of beast
Faces!
Take your turn, take a ride
On the merry-go-round
in an inhuman race
Eye of gold
Thigh of blue
True is false
Who is who?
Curl of lip
Swirl of gown
Ace of hearts
Face of clown
Faces! Drink it in, drink it up
Till you've drowned
In the light
In the sound
But who can name the face?
--- Unknown ---
Masquerade! Grinning yellows, spinning reds
Masquerade! Take your fill, let the spectacle astound you
Masquerade! Burning glances, turning heads
Masquerade! Stop and stare at the sea of smiles around you
Masquerade! Seething shadows breathing lies
Masquerade! You can fool any friend who ever knew you
Masquerade! Leering satyrs, peering eyes
Masquerade! Run and hide, but a face will still pursue you.
--- Madame Giry ---
What a night!

What a crowd!
Makes you glad
Makes you proud
All the creme
De la creme
--- Carlotta ---
Watching us, watching them
--- Meg ---
All our fears are in the past

Three months
--- Piangi ---
Of relief!

Of delight!

Of Elysian peace!
And we can breathe at last.
--- Carlotta ---
No more notes
--- Piangi ---
No more ghosts
--- Madame Giry ---
Here's a health
--- Andre/Firmin ---
Here's a toast
To a prosperous year
To our friends who are here

May the splendour never fade!

What a blessed release!
--- Madame Giry ---
And what a masquerade

Think of it
Our secret engagement.
Look, your future bride.
Just think of it.

Raoul:(Spoken)
Why is it secret? What have we to hide?
You promised me.
--- Unknown ---
Christine:(Spoken)
No, Raoul, please don't, they'll see.
--- Unknown ---
Raoul:(Spoken)
Well then let them see.
It's an engagement, not a crime.
Christine, what are you afraid of?

Let's not argue(Let's not argue)
Please pretend (I can only hope)
You will understand in time (I'll understand in time)
--- Chorus/Crowd ---

Masquerade! Grinning yellows, Spinning reds

--- Phantom ---
Why so silent, good monsieurs?
Did you think that I had left you for good?
Have you missed me, good monsieurs?
I have written you an opera.
Here, I bring the finish score.
Don Juan Triumphant!
Fondest greetings to you all
A few instructions just before rehearsal starts
Carlotta must be taught to act
Not her normal trick of strutting 'round the stage
Our Don Juan must loose some weight
It's not healthy in a man of Piangi's age
And my managers must learn that their place is in an office
Not the arts
As for our star, Miss Christine Daae...
--- Unknown ---
No doubt she'll do her best/It's true, her voice is good
She knows, though
Should she wish to excell
She has much still to learn
If pride will let her return to me, her teacher
Her teacher...
