------ Down Once More/Track Down This Murderer ------
--- PHANTOM ---
Say you'll share with me, one love, one lifetime...
Lead me, save me, from my solitude...
Say you want me here beside you...
Anywhere you go let me come too...
Christine, that's all i ask of...
--- Unknown ---
RAOUL: Oh my god, Oh my god
--- MADAME GIRY ---
Monsieur Le Vicomte, come with me
Monsieur Le Vicomte I know where they are.
--- RAOUL ---
But can I trust you?
--- MADAME GIRY ---
You must, but remember your hand atthe level of your eyes...
--- RAOUL ---
Why?
--- MEG ---
I'll come with you
--- MADAME GIRY ---
No Meg you must stay here. Come with me Monsieur, hurry or we shall be too late.
--- PHANTOM ---
Down once more to the dungeon of my black despair!
Down we plunge to the prison of my mind!
Down that path into darkness deep as hell!
Why, you ask, was I bound and chained in this cold and dismal place?
Not for any mortal sin, but the wickedness of my abhorrent face!
--- CHORUS ---
Track down this murderer!
He must be found!
--- PHANTOM ---
Hounded out by everyone!
Met with hatred everywhere!
No kind word from anyone!
No compassion anywhere!
Christine, Christine ...
Why, why ...?
--- MADAME GIRY ---
Your hand at the level of your eyes!
... at the level of your eyes ...
--- CHORUS ---
Track down this murderer he must be found!
Track down this murderer he must be found!
Hunt out this animal, who runs to ground! Too long he's preyed on us, but now we know, the phantom of the opera is here deep
down inside!
He's here the Phantom of the Opera...
He's here the Phantom of the Opera...
--- CHRISTINE ---
Have you gorged yourself at last in your lust for blood?
Am I now to be prey to your lust for flesh?
--- PHANTOM ---
That fate which condemns me to wallow in blood, has also denied me the joys of the flesh ...
This face - the infection which poisons our love ...
This face, which earned a mother's fear and loathing ...
A mask, my first unfeeling scrap of clothing ...
Pity comes too late - turn around
and face your fate: an eternity of this before your eyes!
--- CHRISTINE ---
This haunted face holds no horror for me now ...
It's in your soul that the true distortion lies ...
--- PHANTOM ---
Wait! I think, my dear, we have a guest!
Sir, this is indeed an unparalleled delight!
I had rather hoped that you would come.
And now my wish comes true - you have truly made my night!
--- RAOUL ---
Free her!
Do what you like only free her!
Have you no pity?
--- PHANTOM ---
Your lover makes a passionate plea!
--- CHRISTINE ---
Please Raoul, it's useless!
--- RAOUL ---
I love her!
Does that mean nothing?
I love her!
Show some compassion ...
--- PHANTOM ---
The world showed no compassion to me!
--- RAOUL ---
Christine, Christine...
Let me see her...
--- PHANTOM ---
Be my guest, sir ...
Monsieur, I bid you welcome!
Did you think that I would harm her?
Why should I make her pay for the sins which are yours?
Order your fine horses now!
Raise up your hand to the level of your eyes!
Nothing can save you now - except perhaps Christine...
Start a new life with me -
Buy his freedom with your love!
Refuse me, and you send your lover to his death!
This is the choice -
This is the point of no return!
--- CHRISTINE ---
The tears I might have shed for your dark fate grow cold, and turn to tears of hate!
--- RAOUL ---
Christine, forgive me please forgive me ...
I did it all for you, and all for nothing ...
--- CHRISTINE ---
Farewell my fallen idol and false friend ...
We had such hopes, and now those hopes are shattered!
--- PHANTOM ---
Too late for turning back, too late for prayers and useless pity!
--- RAOUL ---
Say you love him and my life is over
--- PHANTOM ---
All hope of cries for help; no point in fighting!
--- RAOUL/PHANTOM ---
For either way you choose, he has to win/you cannot win!
--- PHANTOM ---
So, do you end your days with me,
or do you send him to his grave?
--- RAOUL ---
Why make her lie to you, to save me?
--- CHRISTINE ---
Angel of Music...
--- PHANTOM ---
Past the point of no return -
--- RAOUL ---
For pity's sake,
Christine, say no!
--- CHRISTINE ---
...who deserves this?
--- PHANTOM ---
... the final threshold...
--- RAOUL ---
Don't throw your life away for my sake!
--- CHRISTINE ---
When will you see reason ...?
--- PHANTOM ---
His life is now the prize which you must earn!
--- RAOUL ---
I fought so hard to free you ...
--- CHRISTINE ---
Angel of Music ...
--- PHANTOM ---
You've passed the point of no return ...
--- CHRISTINE ---
... you deceived me.
I gave my mind blindly.
--- PHANTOM ---
You try my patience - make your choice!
--- CHRISTINE ---
Pitiful creature of darkness...
What kind of life have you known?
God give me courage to show you you are not alone...
--- CHORUS ---
Track down this murderer he must be found!
Hunt out this animal, who runs to ground! Too long he's preyed on us, but now we know, the phantom of the opera is there
deep down inside!
--- PHANTOM ---
Take her - forget me - forget all of this...
Leave me alone - forget all you've seen...
Go now - don't let them find you!
Take the boat - leave me know, swear never to tell, the secrets you know, of the angel in hell
GO NOW!
GO NOW AND LEAVE ME!
Masquerade...
Paper faces on parade...
Masquerade...
Hide your face so the world will never find you...
Christine, I love you...
--- CHRISTINE ---
Say you'll share with me, one love, one lifetime...
Say the word and I will follow you...
--- RAOUL ---
Share each day with me
--- CHRISTINE ---
each night,
--- RAOUL/CHRISTINE ---
each morning...
--- PHANTOM ---
You alone can make my song take flight -
