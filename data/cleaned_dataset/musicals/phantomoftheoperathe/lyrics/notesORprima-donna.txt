------ Notes/Prima Donna ------
--- Unknown ---
Firmin
Mystery after gala night, it says, mystery of sopranos flight.
Mystified, all the papers say, We are mystified. We suspect foul play!
Bad news on soprano scene
First Carlotta, now Christine.
Still at least the seats get sold,
Gossip's worth its weight in gold.
What a way to run a business
Spare me these unending trials
Half your cast disappears
But the crowd still cheers
Opera!
To hell with Gluck and Handel
Have a scandal and you're sure to have a hit!
--- Unknown ---
Andre
Damnable!
Will they all walk out?
This is damnable!
--- Unknown ---
Firmin
Andre please don't shout
It's publicity and the take is vast
Free publicity
--- Unknown ---
Andre
But we have no cast!
--- Unknown ---
Firmin
Andre have you seen the queue
Ah, it seems you've got one too
--- Unknown ---
Andre
Dear Andre what a charming gala,
Christine was in a word sublime
We were hardly bereft when Carlotta left
On that note: The diva's a disaster,
Must you cast her when she's seasons past her prime?
--- Unknown ---
Firmin
Dear Firmin just a brief reminder;
My salary has not been paid
Send it care of the ghost
By return of post
P.T.O No one likes a debter so it's better if my orders are obeyed!
--- Unknown ---
Andre & Firmin
Who would have the gall to send this?
Someone with a puerile brain
These are both signed O.G
Who the hell is he?
Opera Ghost!
--- Unknown ---
Firmin
It is nothing short of shocking
--- Unknown ---
Andre
He is mocking our position
--- Unknown ---
Firmin
In addition he wants money
--- Unknown ---
Andre
What a funny apparition
--- Unknown ---
Andre & Firmin
To expect a large retainer
Nothing plainer
He is clearly quite insane
--- Unknown ---
Raoul
Where is she?
--- Unknown ---
Andre
You mean Carlotta?
--- Unknown ---
Raoul
I mean Miss Daae.
Where is she?
--- Unknown ---
Firmin
Well how should we know?
--- Unknown ---
Raoul
I want an answer
I take it that you sent me this note
--- Unknown ---
Andre
What all this nonsense?
Of course not
--- Unknown ---
Firmin
Don't look at us
--- Unknown ---
Raoul
She's not with you then?
--- Unknown ---
Firmin
Of course not
--- Unknown ---
Andre
We're in the dark
--- Unknown ---
Raoul
Monsieur don't argue
Isn't this the letter you wrote
--- Unknown ---
Firmin
And what is is that we're meant to have wrote?
...Written!
--- Unknown ---
Andre
Do not fear for Miss Daae
The Angel of Music has her under his wing
Make no attempt to see her again.
--- Unknown ---
Raoul
If you didn't write it then who did?
--- Unknown ---
Carlotta
Where is he?
--- Unknown ---
Andre
Ah, welcome back!
--- Unknown ---
Carlotta & Piangi
Where is he?
Your precious patron
Where is he?
--- Unknown ---
Raoul
What is it now?
--- Unknown ---
Carlotta
I have your letter
A letter that which I rather resent
--- Unknown ---
Firmin
And did you send it?
--- Unknown ---
Raoul
Of course not!
--- Unknown ---
Andre
As if he would
--- Unknown ---
Carlotta & Piangi
You didn't send it?
--- Unknown ---
Raoul
Of course not!
--- Unknown ---
Firmin
What going on?
--- Unknown ---
Carlotta
You dare to tell me
That this is not the letter you sent
--- Unknown ---
Raoul
And what is it that I'm meant to have sent?
Your days at the Opera Populaire are numbered.
Christine Daae will be singing on your behalf tonight.
Be prepared for a great misfortune should you attempt to take her place.
--- Unknown ---
Andre & Firmin
Far too many notes for my taste
And most of them about Christine
All we've heard since we came
Is Miss Daae's name
--- Unknown ---
Madame Giry
Miss Daae has returned
--- Unknown ---
Firmin
No worse for wear as far as we're concerned
--- Unknown ---
Andre
Where precisely is she now?
--- Unknown ---
Madame Giry
I thought it best she was alone
--- Unknown ---
Meg
She needed rest
--- Unknown ---
Raoul
May I see her?
--- Unknown ---
Madame Giry
No monsieur she will see no one
--- Unknown ---
Carlotta & Piangi
Will she sing?
Will she sing?
--- Unknown ---
Madame Giry
Here I have a note
--- Unknown ---
All (except Madame Giry and Meg)
Let me see it
--- Unknown ---
Firmin
Please
Gentlemen, I have now sent you several notes of the most aimnable nature detailing how my Opera House is to be run
You have ignored my orders...
--- Unknown ---
Phantom
...I shall give you one last chance
Christine Daae has returned to you
And I am anxious her career should progress
In the new production of Il Muto
You will therefore cast Carlotta as the page boy
And put Miss Daae in the role of Countess
The role which Miss Daae plays calls for charm and appeal
The role of the page boy is silent which makes my casting in a word, ideal
I shall watch the performance from my normal seat in box 5 which will be kept empty for me
Should these commands be ignored a disaster beyond your imagination will occur
I remain, gentlemen, your obedient servant
O.G
--- Unknown ---
Carlotta & Piangi
Christine!
--- Unknown ---
Andre
What ever next?
--- Unknown ---
Carlotta & Piangi
It's all a ploy to help Christine
--- Unknown ---
Firmin
This is insane
--- Unknown ---
Carlotta
I know who sent this
The Viscount, her lover
--- Unknown ---
Raoul
Indeed, can you belive this?
--- Unknown ---
Firmin
Signora
--- Unknown ---
Carlotta
O tradori!
--- Unknown ---
Andre
This is a joke
--- Unknown ---
Firmin
This changes nothing
--- Unknown ---
Carlotta
O mentitori
--- Unknown ---
Firmin
Signora!
--- Unknown ---
Andre
You are our star
--- Unknown ---
Firmin
And always will be
--- Unknown ---
Andre
Signora
--- Unknown ---
Firmin
The man is made
--- Unknown ---
Andre
We don't take orders
--- Unknown ---
Firmin
Miss Daae will be playing the page boy
The silent role
--- Unknown ---
Andre & Firmin
Carlotta will be playing the lead
--- Unknown ---
Charlotta
It's useless trying to appease me
--- Unknown ---
Piangi
Appease her!
--- Unknown ---
Carlotta
You're only saying this to please me
--- Unknown ---
Piangi
Please her!
--- Unknown ---
Carlotta & Piangi
Lasciatemi morire!
O padre mio!
Dio!
--- Unknown ---
Madame Giry
Who scorn his word beware to those
--- Unknown ---
Carlotta
You have reviled me!
--- Unknown ---
Madame Giry
The angel sees, the angel knows
--- Unknown ---
Raoul
Why did Christine fly from my arms?
--- Unknown ---
Carlotta
You have rebuked me!
--- Unknown ---
Andre & Firmin
Sinora, pardon us
--- Unknown ---
Carlotta
You have replaced me
--- Unknown ---
Aandre & Firmin
Please Signora we beseech you
--- Unknown ---
Madame Giry
This hour shall see your darkest fears
--- Unknown ---
Raoul
I must see her
--- Unknown ---
Carlotta & Piangi
Abbandonata!
Deseredata!
O, sventurata!
--- Unknown ---
Madame Giry
The angel sees, the angel hears
--- Unknown ---
Raoul
Where did she go?
--- Unknown ---
Carlotta & Piangi
Abbandonata!
--- Unknown ---
Andre & Firmin
Senora sing for us
--- Unknown ---
Carlotta & Piangi
Disgraziata!
--- Unknown ---
Andre & Firmin
Don't be a matyr
--- Unknown ---
All
What new suprises lie in store
--- Unknown ---
Andre
Your public needs you
--- Unknown ---
Firmin
We need you too
--- Unknown ---
Carlotta
Wouldn't you rather have your precious little ingenue?
--- Unknown ---
Andre & Firmin
Signora no! The World wants you
Prima Donna first lady of the stage
Your devotees are on their knees to implore you
--- Unknown ---
Andre
Can you bow out when they're shouting your name?
--- Unknown ---
Firmin
Think of how they all adore you
--- Unknown ---
Andre & Firmin
Prima donna enchant us once again
--- Unknown ---
Andre
Think of your muse
--- Unknown ---
Firmin
And all your queues 'round the theatre!
--- Unknown ---
Andre & Firmin
Can you deny us the triumph in store?
--- Unknown ---
Andre, Firmin & Piangi
Sing Prima Donna once more
--- Unknown ---
Raoul
Christine spoke of an angel
--- Unknown ---
Charlotta
Prima Donna your song shall live again
--- Unknown ---
Andre & Firmin
Think of your public
--- Unknown ---
Carlotta
You took a snub but there's a public who needs you
--- Unknown ---
Madame Giry
She has heard the voice of the Angel of Music
--- Unknown ---
Andre & Firmin
Those who hear you liken you to an angel
--- Unknown ---
Carlotta
Think of the cry of undying support
--- Unknown ---
Andre
We get her Opera
--- Unknown ---
Firmin
She gets her limelight
--- Unknown ---
Carlotta
Follow where the lime light leads you
--- Unknown ---
Andre & Firmin
Leading ladies are a trial
--- Unknown ---
Carlotta
Prima Donna your song shall never die
You'll sing again and to unending ovation
--- Unknown ---
Raoul
Order, warnings lunatic!
--- Unknown ---
Andre & Firmin
This misacating will invite damnation
Lunatic demands are regular occurences
--- Unknown ---
Carlotta
Think how you'll sing in that final encore
--- Unknown ---
Andre & Firmin
Sing Prima Donna once more
--- Unknown ---
Raoul
I must see these demands are rejected
--- Unknown ---
Andre & Firmin
Who'd believe a diva happy to relieve
A chorus girl whose gone and slept with the patron?
Raoul and the soubrette, entwined in love's duet!
Although he may demur, he must have been with her!
--- Unknown ---
Carlotta
Fortunata!
Non ancor abbandonata!
--- Unknown ---
Andre & Firmin
You'd never get away with all this in a play,
but if it's loudly sung and in a foreign tongue
It's just the sort of story audiences adore, in fact a perfect opera!
--- Unknown ---
Meg & Christine
For if his curse is on this Opera
--- Unknown ---
All
Prima Donna the world is at your feet
A nation waits, and how it hates to be cheated!
Light Up the stage with that age-old rapport,
Sing Prima Donna
Once more!
--- Unknown ---
Phantom
So, it is to be war between us. If these demands are not met,  a disaster beyond imagination will occur!
--- Unknown ---
All
