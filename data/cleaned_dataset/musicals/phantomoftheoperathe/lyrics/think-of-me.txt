------ Think of Me ------
--- CHRISTINE ---
Think of me, think of me fondly,
when we've said goodbye.
Remember me once in a while -
please promise me you'll try.
When you find that, once again, you long
to take your heart back and be free -
if you ever find a moment,
spare a thought for me
--- Unknown ---
We never said our love was evergreen,
or as unchanging as the sea -
but if you can still remember
stop and think of me . . .
--- Unknown ---
Think of all the things
we've shared and seen -
don't think about the way things
might have been . . .
--- Unknown ---
Think of me, think of me waking,
silent and resigned.
Imagine me, trying too hard
to put you from my mind.
Recall those days
look back on all those times,
think of the things we'll never do -
there will never be a day,
when I won't think of you . . .
--- RAOUL ---
Can it be? Can it be Christine?
Bravo!
Long ago, it seems so long ago
How young and innocent we were...
She may not remember me,
but I remember her...
--- CHRISTINE ---
Flowers fade,
The fruits of summer fade,
They have their seasons, so do we
but please promise me, that sometimes
