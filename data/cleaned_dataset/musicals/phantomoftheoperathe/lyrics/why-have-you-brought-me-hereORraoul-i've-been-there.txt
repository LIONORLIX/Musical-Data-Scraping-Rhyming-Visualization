------ Why Have You Brought Me Here/Raoul I've Been There ------
--- RAOUL ---
Why have you brought me here?
--- CHRISTINE ---
Canâ€™t go back there!
--- RAOUL ---
We must return!
--- CHRISTINE ---
He'll kill you!
His eyes will find us there!
--- RAOUL ---
Christine, don't say that.
CHRISTINE
Those eyes that burn!
--- RAOUL ---
Don't even think it
--- CHRISTINE ---
And if he has to kill a thousand men
--- RAOUL ---
Forget this waking nightmare...
--- CHRISTINE ---
The Phantom of the Opera will kill...
--- RAOUL ---
This phantom is a fable
Believe me
--- CHRISTINE ---
...and kill again!
--- RAOUL ---
There is no Phantom of the Opera
--- BOTH ---
My God, who is this man...
--- CHRISTINE ---
...who hunts to kill?
--- RAOUL ---
...this mask of death?
--- CHRISTINE ---
I can't escape from him...
--- RAOUL ---
Whose is this voice you hear...
--- CHRISTINE ---
...I never will!
--- RAOUL ---
...with every breath?
--- BOTH ---
And in this labyrinth,
where night is blind
the Phantom of the Opera is here/there
inside my/your mind...
--- RAOUL ---
There is no Phantom of the Opera...
--- CHRISTINE ---
Raoul, I've been there
to his world of unending night
To a world with the daylight dissolves into darkness...
darkness...
Raoul, I've seen him!
Can I ever forget that sight?
Can I ever escape from that face?
So distorted, deformed, it was hardly a face
in that darkness...
darkness...
But his voice filled my spirit
with a strange, sweet sound...
In that night there was music in my mind...
And through music my soul began to soar!
And I heard as I'd never heard before...
--- RAOUL ---
What you heard was a dream and nothing more...
--- CHRISTINE ---
Yet in his eyes
all the sadness of the world
Those pleading eyes,
that both threaten and adore
--- RAOUL ---
Christine...
Christine...
--- PHANTOM ---
Christine...
--- CHRISTINE ---
