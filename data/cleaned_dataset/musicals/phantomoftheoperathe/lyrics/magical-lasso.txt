------ Magical Lasso ------
--- Unknown ---
Like yellow parchment is his skin ...
A great black hole served as the nose that never grew ...
You must be always on your guard,
Or he will catch you with his magical lasso!

Those who speak of what they know find,
Too late, that prudent silence is wise.
