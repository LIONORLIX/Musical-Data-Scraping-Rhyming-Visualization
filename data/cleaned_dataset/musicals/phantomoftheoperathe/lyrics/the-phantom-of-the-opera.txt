------ The Phantom of the Opera ------
--- CHRISTINE ---
In sleep he sang to me
In dreams he came
That voice that calls to me and speaks my name
And do I dream again for now I find
The Phantom of the Opera is there
Inside my mind
--- PHANTOM ---
Sing once again with me
Our strange duet
My power over you grows stronger yet
And though you turn from me to glance behind
The Phantom of the Opera is there
Inside your mind
--- CHRISTINE ---
Those who have seen your face
Draw back in fear
I am the mask you wear
--- PHANTOM ---
It's me they hear...
--- BOTH ---
Your/My spirit and my/your voice in one combined
The Phantom of the Opera is there
Inside my/your mind
--- BACKGROUND ---
He's there, the phantom of the opera!
--- CHRISTINE ---
He`s there, the phantom of the opera
--- PHANTOM ---
Sing, my Angel of Music
Sing, my Angel
Sing for me
Sing, my Angel!
Sing for me!
