------ Music of the Night ------
--- Unknown ---
Night time sharpens,
Heightens each sensation
Darkness stirs and wakes imagination
Silently the senses
Abandon their defenses
--- Unknown ---
Slowly gently, night unfurls
Its splendour
Grasp it, sense it,
Tremulous and tender
--- Unknown ---
Turn your face away
From the garish light of day,
Turn your thoughts away
From cold unfeeling light
And listen to the music of the night
--- Unknown ---
Close your eyes and
Surrender to your darkest dreams
Purge your thoughts of the life
You knew before
Close your eyes,
Let your spirit start to soar
--- Unknown ---
And you'll live as you've
Never lived before
--- Unknown ---
Softly, deftly
Music shall caress you
Hear it, feel it
Secretly possess you
--- Unknown ---
Open up your mind
Let your fantasies unwind
In this darkness which you know
You can not fight,
The darkness of
The music of the night
--- Unknown ---
Let your mind start a journey
Through a strange new world
Leave all thoughts of the world
You knew before
Let your soul take
You where you long to be
--- Unknown ---
Only then can you belong to me
--- Unknown ---
Floating, falling
Sweet intoxication
Touch me, trust me
Savor each sensation
Let the dream begin
Let your darker side give in
To the power of
The music that I write
The power of
The music of the night
--- Unknown ---
You alone can make
My song take flight
Help me make the
Music of the night
