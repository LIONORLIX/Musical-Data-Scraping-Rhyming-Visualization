------ Wandering Child ------
--- Unknown ---
The PHANTOM emerges from behind the cross)
PHANTOM (very soft and enticing)
Wandering child . . .
So lost . . .
So helpless . . .
Yearning for my
Guidance . . .
--- Unknown ---
(Bewildered, CHRISTINE looks up, and murmurs
breathlessly):
--- CHRISTINE ---
Angel . . . or father . . .
Friend . . . or
Phantom . . . ?
Who is it there,
Staring . . . ?
--- Unknown ---
PHANTOM (more and more hypnotic)
Have you forgotten your Angel . . .?
--- CHRISTINE ---
Angel . . . oh, speak . . .
What endless longings
Echo in this whisper . . .!
--- Unknown ---
(RAOUL appears in the shadows and watches for a moment transfixed)
--- Unknown ---
PHANTOM (now drawing CHRISTINE towards him)
Too long you've wandered in winter . . .
RAOUL (to himself a murmur)
Once again
She is his . . .
--- PHANTOM ---
Far from my far-reaching gaze . . .
--- RAOUL ---
Once again she returns . . .
--- Unknown ---
CHRISTINE (increasingly mesmerized)
Wildly my mind beats against you . . .
--- PHANTOM ---
You resist . . .
--- Unknown ---
PHANTOM/CHRISTINE
Yet your/the soul
Obeys . . .
--- RAOUL ---
. . . to the arms
Of her angel . . .
Angel or demon . . .
Still he calls her . . .
Luring her back, from the grave . . .
Angel or dark seducer . . .?
Who are you, strange
Angel . . .?
--- PHANTOM ---
Angel of Music!
You denied me/I denied you
Turning from true beauty . . .
Angel of Music!
Do not shun me/My protector . . .
Come to your strange
Angel . . .
--- CHRISTINE ---
Angel of Music!
--- Unknown ---
(CHRISTINE moves towards the figure of the
PHANTOM)
--- Unknown ---
PHANTOM (beckoning her)
I am your Angel of Music . . .
Come to me: Angel of Music . . .
--- Unknown ---
RAOUL (suddenly calling out)
Angel of darkness!
Cease this torment!
--- Unknown ---
(Inexorably the PHANTOM continues to beckon
CHRISTINE)
--- PHANTOM ---
I am your Angel of Music . . .
Come to me: Angel of Music . . .
--- Unknown ---
RAOUL (in desperation)
Christine! Christine listen to me!
Whatever you may believe, this man . . .
this thing . . . is not your father!
Let her go! For God's sake, let her go! Christine !
(Coming out of her trance CHRISTINE turns and
mouths the words):
--- CHRISTINE ---
