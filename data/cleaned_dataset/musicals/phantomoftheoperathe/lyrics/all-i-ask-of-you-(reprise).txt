------ All I Ask of You (Reprise) ------
--- PHANTOM ---
I gave you my music . . .
made your song take wing . . .
and now, how you've
repaid me:
denied me
and betrayed me . . .
He was bound to love you
when he heard you sing . . .

--- CHRISTINE/RAOUL (Background) ---
Say you'll share with me,
one love, one lifetime...
Say the word and I will follow you...
Share each day with me
Each night, each morning
--- PHANTOM ---
You will curse the day you did not do!
All of the Phantom asked of you!
