------ My Big Mistake ------
--- Unknown ---
When I was very young,
I had a perfect life.
My Pa a perfect husband and my Ma a perfect wife.
And everyday my life went by so perfectly?
I made a perfect plan,
I dreamed some perfect dreams.
But now I look around, my dreams are splitting at the seams!
I made one big decision and now look at me?
When I do something wrong I do it perfectly?
--- Unknown ---
My big mistake,
Roping you in.
I got my wish,
Now I can?t win.
I thought once I caught you you?d quit your roamin?
But I?m the one who?s caught in a world I?m not at home in!
--- Unknown ---
My big mistake,
Thinking you?d change.
Fancyin? life
Home on the range.
?Cause I like days, I?ll carefully reckon
You live life from second to second
Yet just touch me, and there?s no other choice I?d make
I love my big mistake!
