------ Never Met A Man I Didn't Like ------
--- Unknown ---
Never met a man I didn't like
High fallutten gent or bowery bum
Yes, I've come a long way
down the pike
Never met a man I didn't like
--- Unknown ---
Never shook a hand I didn't like
Royal Prince of Wales or working Joe
Though I know life's one long rocky hike
Never met a man I didn't like
--- Unknown ---
In all of my wanderin'
I've bumped into all kinds of people
Fancy cinema stars, fake evangelist,
politicians, morticians
--- Unknown ---
And I have reached the conclusion
while hiking the pike
Though I try and I try
Never once met a guy that I didn't like
I said I roamed along the Napa Valley,
Shubert Alley, Rue de la Paix,
Oklahoma, and Kalamazoo
And I have reached the conclusion
while hiking the pike
Yes I'll say when I'm done
No I never met one that I didn't like
--- Unknown ---
Met the worst and met the best
Some who put me to the test
Almost made me change my mind
Yet somehow I always find
If you don't expect too much
There's a certain human touch
Homo sapiens have got other animals have not
--- Unknown ---
Try the shoes on that are his
Feel what makes him what he is
What's it like inside his skin
Living in the skin he's in
Just like me a lump of sod
There but for the grace of God
That is the philosophy of this part time Cherokee
--- Unknown ---
President and King or Pat and Mike
Folks can laugh but I can't give up hope
Spun my rope along way down the pike
Never met a man I didn't like
High tone gent, bowery bum
Prince of Wales, working Joe
Pat and Mike
Cherokee, philosophy
