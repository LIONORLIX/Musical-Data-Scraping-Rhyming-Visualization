------ No Man Left For Me ------
--- Unknown ---
Alone again and blue
He's left me alone again - what's new
All I do is sit and stare
At a snapshot and an empty chair
What goods a man who's never there
--- Unknown ---
He's a trav'ling man, He's a flying man,
After dinner speaker, Speachifying man,
He's a one man show on the radio
He's a columnist, Friend of president,
Movie star for the nations residents
Zigfeilds staring man, Walking talking man,
Mr busy bee.
There's no man left for me
--- Unknown ---
Sometimes I tell myself the worms turning
I'll pack a bag and leave him flat
But every time I start
This feeling floods my heart
He needs me to feed the cat
--- Unknown ---
But when I'm by myself I'm so lonesome
A party makes it twice as grim
The people laugh and play
My mind is miles away
Its off on the road with him
--- Unknown ---
Hotel staying man, Suitcase packing man,
When I look around me he's the lacking man
He's most anywhere, Land or sea or air
As an absentee He's a winner man
Out for lunch and won't be home for dinner man
Loop the looping man, Fly the cooping man
Its so plain to see
--- Unknown ---
He wont miss me
He don't need me
Gonna get away from Mr busy bee
I can't make love to a shadow
