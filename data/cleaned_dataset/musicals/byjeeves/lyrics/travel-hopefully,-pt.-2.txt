------ Travel Hopefully, Pt. 2 ------
--- BINGO ---
Sounds sweet
--- BERTIE ---
Goes like a bird. Hold on to your hat.
--- BINGO ---
Hey, this is more like it...
--- BOTH ---
My philosophy's to travel hopefully
And making each day that I survive
An opportunity to share the company
That welcomes me when I arrive
--- BINGO ---
Travel hopefully with me
Let all your thoughts run free
--- BERTIE ---
We can't have come this far...
--- BINGO ---
What's that?
--- BERTIE ---
Nothing
--- BINGO ---
Till with any luck you'll feel
Your inner voice reveal
--- BERTIE ---
Just where the hell we are
--- BOTH ---
