------ Half a Moment ------
--- HAROLD ---
Time, they say, is relative
Infinite as space
This must be eternity
Neither time nor place...
Half a moment
We are together
I shall want
Half a moment
I shall treasure
Keep it locked away
For some future rainy day
Should you leave me
With just this moment
In my mind, I will capture it anew
Like some picture
Taken in my childhood
Half a moment
Spent with you
--- STIFFY ---
Time looks kindly
On fleeting lovers
They can turn
The briefest hour into a day
Turn a moment
To a lifetime
Making it to last
Blending future with the past...
Ev'ry moment
We spend together
I don't care
What they say or try to do
Can't erase it
All that's gone between us
Shared with you
--- BOTH ---
Half a moment
We are together
I shall want
No one else and nothing new
Half a moment
I shall treasure
Keep it locked away
For some future rainy day
We're together
What else can matter?
Even though half a moment
Is too few
I shall save it
Till I have another
Making one whole moment
