Ladies and gentlemen (Lloyd)

Double L-O-Y-D
I ain't gotta think I know they like me
And I ain't even gotta rock a white T
Decatur with them gattas is where you'll find me
Rolled down windows clouds around me
I'm the type that don't even need no ID
Walk up in the club and change VIP
Drinks is on me
Best believe so are you when you leave
Girl I ain't really try'n to game ya
But I swear that look familar
You can find out with these shots of this silver
You saying that you already met me
Your not a groupie so you don't wanna sweat me
I remember your the girl from Miami (allow me to reintroduce my self)
--- Unknown ---
I be that young, fly, flashy
If they in the slow lane I'm passin
Girl anything that you want just ask me
Call me Lloyd, Lloyd, Lloyd
--- Unknown ---
I be that young, fly, flashy
With that old school swagga with me
Girl I need you to get real nasty with me
