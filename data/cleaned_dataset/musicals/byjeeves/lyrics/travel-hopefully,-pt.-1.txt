------ Travel Hopefully, Pt. 1 ------
--- BERTIE ---
I've invariably found
That feet kept on the ground
Allow the grass to grow
Check your mirrors front and rear
Slip smoothly into gear
Then hit the road and go
Feel the pistons steady beat
The camshaft 'neath your feet
That big end start to fly...
--- JEEVES ---
May I advise a modicum of caution, sir...
--- BERTIE ---
He who hesitates is lost
Burn bridges once they're crossed
Don't stop to say goodbye
--- JEEVES ---
There is a blind corner approaching, sir...
--- BERTIE ---
My philosophy's to travel hopefully
And making each day that I survive
An opportunity to share the company
That welcomes me when I arrive
Hark the mistle-thrush's cry
The hedge-rows rushing by
The curlew on the wing
--- JEEVES ---
That is a crow, sir.
--- BERTIE ---
List! Some distant church's bells
'Midst bracing country smells
Those fields of golden - thing...
--- JEEVES ---
Corn, sir.
--- BERTIE ---
My philosophy's to travel hopefully
And making each day that I survive
An opportunity to share the company
That welcomes me when I arrive
Travel's broadened out my mind
Until today you'll find...
--- JEEVES ---
The widest head I know...
--- BERTIE ---
Thank you, Jeeves. You did say wisest, didn't you?
--- JEEVES ---
Oh yes, sir.
--- BERTIE ---
Every traveller I meet
I'll always stop to greet
--- JEEVES ---
Be careful how you go, sir...
--- BERTIE ---
My philosophy's to travel hopefully
And making each day that I survive
An opportunity to share the company
That welcomes me when I arrive
Travel hopefully with me
And I will guarantee
There'll be no pause for doubt
Hit the nearest country track
No time for looking back
