------ Love's Maze ------
--- STIFFY ---
Deep in love's maze
There my heart strays
Caught in a flurry of worry and doubt
Down love's pathways
There my heart plays
Whispering secrets it's longing to shout
All I need's a sympathetic friend
To help me find a way to leave -
Love's maze is a magical labyrinth
Close paths hidden far from gaze
Love's maze is for lovers in jeopardy
Lost there in a rainbow haze
Won't you save me?
Please assist me
Help me decipher its intricate ways?
Love has touched me
Love has kissed me
Holding me prisoner deep in this maze
--- BERTIE ---
Well, you can't blame me. Cupid never pays
You'll saunter round for day's inside love's -
--- STIFFY ---
Love's maze is a mystical wonderland
Conceals what the heart conveys
Love's maze is a puzzle in paradise
Misleads all the eye surveys
--- BERTIE ---
I did warn you
I have sworn to
Steer a wide berth, for I know to my cost
It's predicted
Self-inflicted
People in mazes do tend to get lost
--- STIFFY ---
All I need's a very special friend
To rescue me from here inside
--- STIFFY & MAIDS ---
Love's maze is a crazy kaleidoscope
All roads leading diff'rent ways
Love's maze, like a swaying calliope
One dance where the piper pays
Love's maze is a hatter's mad party time
One feast lasting nights and days
Love's maze is a firework spectacular
Bright skies as the bonfires blaze
All praise as we dance in its corridors
All part of these grand displays
Behold every lover who's ever born
All lost in their own love's maze
--- STIFFY ---
All I need's a little help from you...
--- BERTIE ---
You'll never drag me there inside love's -
--- ALL ---
Love's maze is a crazy kaleidoscope

Love's maze is a firework spectacular
Bright skies as the bonfires blaze
Love's maze is a magical labyrinth
Close paths hidden far from gaze
