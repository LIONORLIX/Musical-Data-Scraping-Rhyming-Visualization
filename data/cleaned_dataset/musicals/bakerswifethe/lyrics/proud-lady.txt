------ Proud Lady ------
--- Unknown ---
Ah, i'm in love
I'm in love at last
I'm in love, i'm in love
And isn't it a crime?
Isn't it a crying shame that the love of my life
Should have to be another man's wife?
But i've finally found the one true love of my life...
--- Unknown ---
She splits my senses at the seams
She sends a shiver up my spine
I see her body in my dreams
And if she's normal, she sees mine
She's all i'm ever thinking of
Her mouth, her hair, and all the rest
I think all women should have love
And one like her should have... The best!
--- Unknown ---
There is no rule or law in heaven or on earth
There is no way to stop this fire once it starts
In lips and hands and hearts
And other moving parts...
--- Unknown ---
And i'm singing
Oh, proud lady
You and i both know
Someday you will be mine
And we'll go to a place where the grass is cool
And shady
And with a smile on your face, you'll come into my
Arms
And love will flow like wine...
--- Unknown ---
Next time i go to get the bread
I know exactly what i?ll wear
A belt that?s tight, a shirt that?s red
And open just enough to show a little hair
No other girl i've ever known
Has looked as hot and kept as cool
I know she can't be made of stone
I know i can't be such a fool
--- Unknown ---
No matter what the pain, no matter what the price
No matter what, i wouldn't stop it if i could
How can a thing be bad
When it feels so good?
--- Unknown ---
And i'm singing
Oh, proud lady
You and i both know
Oh, yes, you will be mine
And we'll go to that place
Where the grass is cool and shady
And with a smile on your face,
You'll come into my arms
And love will flow like wine...
--- Unknown ---
I'm in love
I'm in love, at last
I'm in love, i'm in love
And isn't it a crime?
Isn't it a crying shame that the love of my life
Should have to be another man's wife...?
Well, i'm sorry for the guy
But there's nothing i won't try
To win the one true love of my whole life!
