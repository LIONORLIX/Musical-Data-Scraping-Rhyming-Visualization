------ The One on the Left ------
--- Unknown ---
SOLDIER (to his Companion)
The one on the left is nice and pink.
I’ll tip her a wink.
The one on the right seems charming, too,
Although she does look rather blue …
Well, what shall we do?
--- Unknown ---
CELESTE #2
They’re not paying the least bit attention to us.
--- Unknown ---
CELESTE #1
You really should try using that pole.
--- SOLDIER ---
The one on the left is awfully bold —
I wonder how old.
The one on the right is more demure —
Or less mature,
You can’t be sure.
She isn’t much over seventeen.
She looks pretty clean...
I see what you mean.
--- Unknown ---
CELESTE #2
I told you this would make no difference.
--- Unknown ---
CELESTE #1
Oh! Oh! ...
--- Unknown ---
CELESTE #2
What’s wrong?
--- Unknown ---
CELESTE #1
Just sit there.
--- SOLDIER ---
May we be of some service, Madame?
--- Unknown ---
CELESTE #1
Mademoiselle.
--- Unknown ---
CELESTE #2
She has a fish.
--- Unknown ---
CELESTE #1
He knows.
--- SOLDIER ---
Allow me.
--- Unknown ---
CELESTE #1
Oh. It tugged so...
--- SOLDIER ---
There’s no sign of a fish here.
--- Unknown ---
CELESTE #1
Oh me. My name’s Celeste. And this is my friend.
--- Unknown ---
CELESTE #2
Celeste.
I don’t think he likes me.
--- Unknown ---
CELESTE #1
Certainly he likes you.
You take the other one...
--- Unknown ---
CELESTE #2
That one is peculiar —
--- Unknown ---
CELESTE #1
How is he peculiar?
--- Unknown ---
CELESTE #2
Why’s he so qui —
--- Unknown ---
CELESTE #1 (to Soldier)
Do you have a name?
--- SOLDIER ---
I beg your pardon. Napoleon. Some people feel I should change it.
--- Unknown ---
CELESTE #2
And your friend?
--- SOLDIER ---
Yes. He is my friend.
--- Unknown ---
CELESTE #2
Why is he so quiet?
--- Unknown ---
CELESTE #1
He’s very quiet.
--- SOLDIER ---
Yes. Actually he is. He lost his hearing during combat exercises.
--- Unknown ---
CELESTE #1
Oh. What a shame.
--- SOLDIER ---
He can’t speak, either.
--- Unknown ---
CELESTE #2
Oh. How dreadful.
--- SOLDIER ---
We have become very close, though.
--- Unknown ---
CELESTE #1
So I see.
Both of them are perfect.
--- Unknown ---
CELESTE #2
You can have the other.
--- Unknown ---
CELESTE #1
I don’t want the other.
--- Unknown ---
CELESTE #2
I don’t want the other either.
--- SOLDIER ---
Mademoiselles,
I and my friend,
We are but soldiers!
Passing the time
In between wars
For weeks at an end.
--- Unknown ---
CELESTE #2
Shouldn’t we be going?
--- Unknown ---
CELESTE #1
No, will you be quiet?
--- Unknown ---
CELESTE #2
Something is peculiar —
--- SOLDIER ---
And after a week
Spent mostly indoors
With nothing but soldiers,
Ladies, I and my friend
Trust we will not offend,
Which we’d never intend,
By suggesting we spend —
--- THE CELESTES ---
Oh, spend —
--- SOLDIER ---
— this magnificent Sunday —
--- THE CELESTES ---
Oh, Sunday —
--- SOLDIER ---
— with you and your friend.
--- Unknown ---
CELESTE #2
The one on the right seems quite attached.
--- Unknown ---
CELESTE #1
As well as scratched.
--- SOLDIER ---
Admit it, old man, we’re not badly matched.
--- ALL ---
It’s certainly fine for Sunday
--- Unknown ---
SOLDIER (to Companion)
The one on the left seems quite subdued.
--- Unknown ---
CELESTE #2
I’m not in the mood.
--- Unknown ---
CELESTE #1 (to Celeste #2)
You’re ruining things and we’re being rude —
--- ALL ---
It’s certainly fine for Sunday!
--- Unknown ---
SOLDIER, CELESTE #1
My only advice
Is don’t think twice.
--- Unknown ---
SOLDIER (to Celeste #1)
Would you care for an ice?
--- THE CELESTES ---
Oh, an ice would be nice!
--- Unknown ---
CELESTE #2 (to Celeste #1)
Will they buy us a drink?
--- SOLDIER ---
Are they virgins, you think?
--- ALL ---
It’s certainly fine for Sunday!
--- Unknown ---
CELESTE #2 (to Celeste #1, referring to Companion)
Is that a mustache
Or just a gash?
--- Unknown ---
CELESTE #1 (to Celeste #2)
But just look at the sash!
--- Unknown ---
SOLDIER (to Companion)
Did you bring any cash?
--- Unknown ---
CELESTE #1
The buckles and braid —
--- Unknown ---
CELESTE #2
The gold brocade —
--- Unknown ---
CELESTE #1
The boots —
--- Unknown ---
CELESTE #2
The blade —!
--- SOLDIER ---
Shall we head for the glade?
--- Unknown ---
CELESTE #1
Heading for the shadows —!
--- Unknown ---
CELESTE #2
Anything can happen —
--- Unknown ---
CELESTE #1
Wonder what they’re planning.
--- Unknown ---
CELESTE #2
What they’re planning?
--- Unknown ---
CELESTE #1
What they’re planning later on!
--- Unknown ---
SOLDIER (to Companion)
The one on the right gave you a look —
Let’s hope she can cook.
--- THE CELESTES ---
Taking us to dinner —
Maybe to the follies —!
Anyhow, it’s certainly fine for Sunday!
--- Unknown ---
CELESTE #1
The one on the right is odd, it’s true,
But what can we do?
--- Unknown ---
SOLDIER (to Companion)
The one on the left —
--- Unknown ---
CELESTE #1
You’re odd as he —
--- SOLDIER ---
— has great esprit —
--- Unknown ---
CELESTE #2
I don’t agree —
--- Unknown ---
SOLDIER, CELESTE #1
The one on the left is right for me —
So the one on the right is left for you.
