------ Chromolume #7 / Putting It Together ------
--- Harriet ---
I mean, I don't understand completely-
--- Billy ---
I'm not surprised.
--- Harriet ---
But he combines all these different trends.
--- Billy ---
I'm not surprised.
--- Harriet ---
You can't divide art today
Into categories neatly
--- Billy ---
Oh
--- Harriet ---
What matters is the means, not the ends
--- Billy ---
I'm not surprised
--- Both ---
That is the state of the art, my dear,
That is the state of the art.
--- Greenburg ---
It's not enough knowing good from rotten
--- Redmond ---
You're telling me-
--- Greenburg ---
When something new pops up every day
--- Redmond ---
You're telling me-
--- Greenburg ---
It's only new, though, for now-
--- Redmond ---
Nouveau
--- Greenburg ---
But yesterday's forgotten
--- Redmond ---
And tomorrow is already as pass?
--- Greenburg ---
There's no surprise
--- Both ---
That is the state of the art, my friend,
That is the state of the art
--- Betty ---
He's an original
--- Alex ---
Was
--- Naomi ---
I like the images
--- Alex ---
Some
--- Betty ---
Come on
You had your moment,
Now it's George's turn-
--- Unknown ---
-------Voice Over Voice-------
[[Alex, Betty, & Naomi]]
It's George's turn?
I wasn't talking turns,
Don't you think he's original?
Well, yes...
I'm talking art.
You're talking crap.
But is it really new?
Well, no...
His own collaborator-!
It's more than novelty.
Well, yes...
It's all promotion, but then-
It's just impersonal, but-
That is the state of the art,
Isn't it? Well...

--- Billy ---
Art isn't easy-
--- Harriet ---
Even when you've amassed it-
--- Betty ---
Fighting for prizes-
--- Greenburg ---
No one can be an oracle
--- Redmond ---
Art isn't easy
--- Alex ---
Suddenly-
You're past it
--- Naomi ---
All compromises-
--- Harriet ---
And then when it's allegorical-
--- George ---
Art isn't easy-
--- All ---
Any way you look at it.
--- George ---
All right, George
As long as it's your night, George...
You know what's in the room, George.
Another Chromolume, George.
It's time to get to work...
--- Greenburg ---
George, I want you to meet one of our board members.
This is Harriet Pawling.
--- Harriet ---
What a pleasure.
And this is my friend, Billy Webster.
--- Billy ---
How do you do.
--- Greenburg ---
Well, I'll just leave you three to chat.
--- George ---
Say cheese, George,
And put them et their ease George.
You're up on the trapeze, George.
Machines don't grow on trees, George.
Start putting it together...
--- Harriet ---
This is the third piece of yours I've seen.
They are getting so large!
--- George ---
Art isn't easy-
Even when You're hot.
--- Billy ---
Are these inventions of yours one of a kind?
--- George ---
Advancing art is easy-
Yes.
Financing it is not.
A vision's just a vision
If it's only in your heed.
If no one gets to see it,
It's as good as dead.
If has to come to light!
I put the names of my contributors on the side of each machine.
--- Harriet ---
How clever.
--- George ---
Bit by bit,
Putting it together...
Piece by Piece-
Only way to make a work of art.
Every moment makes a contribution,
Every little detail plays a part.
Having just a vision's no solution,
Everything depends on execution:
Putting it together-
That's what counts!
--- Harriet ---
The Board of the Foundation is meeting next week...
--- George ---
Ounce by ounce,
Putting it together...
--- Harriet ---
You'll come to lunch.
--- George ---
Small amounts,
Adding up to make a work of art.
First of all you need a good foundation,
Otherwise it's risky from the start.
Takes a little cocktail conversation,
But without the proper preparation,
Having just a vision's no solution,
Everything depends on execution.
The art of making art
Is putting it together
Bit by bit...
--- Redmond ---
We haven't met. Charles Redmond, County Museum of Texas.
Wanted you to know we're in the process of giving out some sizable
commissions-I hope you don't mind my bringing up business during a social occasion...
--- George ---
Link by link,
Making the connections...
Drink by drink
Fixing and perfecting the design.
Adding just a dab of politician
Lining up the funds but in addition
Lining up a prominent commission,
Otherwise your perfect composition
Isn't going to get much exhibition.
Art isn't easy.
Every minor detail
Is a major decision,
Have to keep things in scale,
Have to hold to your vision-
Every time I start to feel defensive,
I remember lasers are expensive.
What's a little cocktail conversation
If it gets the funds for your foundation,
Leading to a prominent commission,
And an exhibition in addition?
--- All ---
Art isn't easy-
--- Alex and Betty ---
Trying to make connections-
--- All ---
Who understands it-?
--- Harriet and Billy ---
Difficult to evaluate-
--- All ---
Art isn't easy-
--- Greenburg and Redmond ---
Trying to form collections-
--- All ---
Always in transit-
--- Naomi ---
And then when you have to collaborate!
--- All ---
Art isn't easy,
Any way you look at it...
--- Randolph ---
George, hello. Lee Randolph. I handle the public relations for the museum.
There's a lot of opportunity for some nice press here...
--- George ---
Dot by dot,
Building up the image.
Shot by shot,
Keeping at a distance doesn't pay.
Still, if you remember your objective,
Not give all your privacy away,
A little bit of hype can be effective,
Long as you can keep it in perspective.
After all, without some recognition
No one's going to give you a commission.
Art isn't easy.
Overnight you're a trend,
You're the right combination-
Then the trend's at an end,
You're suddenly last year's sensation.
If you feel a sense of coalition,
Then you never really stand alone.
If you want your work to reach fruition,
What you need's a link with your tradition,
And of course a prominent commission,
Plus a little formal recognition,
So that you can go on exhibit-
So that your work can go on exhibition-
--- Blair ---
There's the man of the hour.
--- George ---
Blair! Hello. I read your piece on Neo-Expressionism-
--- Blair ---
Good for you.
--- George ---
Well, what did you think?
--- Blair ---
George. Chromolume number 7?
--- George ---
Be nice, George...
--- Blair ---
I was hoping it would be a series of three - four at the most.
--- Unknown ---
-------Voice Over Voice-------
[[George]]
You have to pay a price, George...
They like to give advice, George
Don't think about it twice George...
I disagree
--- Blair ---
I have touted your work from
the beginning, you know that.
You were really on to something
with these light machine-once.
Now they're just becoming more
and more about less and less.
------End Voice Over Voice------
--- Blair ---
Now don't get me wrong. You're a talented guy.
But I think you are capable of far more.
Not that you couldn't succeed by
doing Chromolume after Chromolume - but there are new discoveries to be made, George.
--- George ---
Be new, George.
They tell you till they're blue, George:
You're new or else you're through, George,
And even if it's true, George-
You do what you can do...
Bit by bit,
Putting it together.
Piece by piece.
Working out the vision night and day.
All it takes is time and perseverance,
With a little luck along the way,
Putting in a personal appearance,
Gathering supporters and adherents...
--- Harriet ---
But he combines all these different trends...
--- George ---
Mapping out the right configuration,
Starting with a suitable foundation...
--- Betty ---
He's an original...
--- Alex ---
Was...
--- George ---
Lining up a prominent commission-
And an exhibition in addition-
Here a little dab of politician-
--- Unknown ---
There a little touch of publication-
Till you have a balanced composition-
Everything depends on preparation-
Even if you do have the suspicion
That it's taking all your concentration-
--- Unknown ---
-------Voice Over Voice-------
[[Betty and Alex]]
I like those images.
Some
They're just his personal response.
To what?
The painting!
Bullshit. Anyway, the painting's
overrated...
Overrated? It's a masterpiece!
A masterpiece? Historically
important maybe-
Oh, now you're judging Seurat,
are you?
All it is is pleasant, just like
George's work:
It's just your jealousy of
George's work:
No nuance, no response, no relevance-
There's nuance, and there's response,
there's relevance-
There's not much point in arguing.
Besides, it's all promotion, but then-
There's not much point in arguing.
You say it's all promotion, but then-
------End Voice Over Voice------
--- Greenburg ---
It's only new, though. for now,
And yesterday's forgotten.
Today it's all a matter of promotion,
But then-
--- Redmond ---
Nouveau.
And yesterday's forgotten.
Today it's all a matter of promotion,
But then-
--- Harriet ---
You can't divide art today.
Go with it.
What will they think of next?
--- Billy ---
I'm not surprised.
What will they think of next?
--- Others ---
Most art today
Is a matter of promotion, but then-
--- All ---
That is the state of the art,
And art isn't easy...
And that
Is the state
Of the Art!
--- George ---
The art of making art
Is putting it together-
Bit by bit-
Link by link-
Drink by drink-
Mink by mink-
And that
Is the state
Of the
