------ Lesson 8 ------
--- George ---
Charles has a book...
Charles shows them his crayons...
Marie has the ball of Charles...
Good for Marie...
Charles misses his ball...
George misses Marie...
George misses a lot...
George is alone
--- Unknown ---
George looks around
He sees the park
It is depressing
George looks ahead
George sees the dark
George feels afraid
Where are the people
Out strolling on Sunday?
--- Unknown ---
George looks within
George is adrift
George goes by guessing
George looks behind
He had a gift
When did it fade?
You wanted people out
Strolling on Sunday-
Sorry, Marie...
--- Unknown ---
See George remember how George used to be,
Stretching his vision in every direction
See George attempting to see a connection
When all he can see
Is maybe a tree-
The family tree-
Sorry, Marie...
--- Unknown ---
George is afraid
George sees the park
George sees it dying
George too may fade,
Leaving no mark,
Just passing through
Just like the people
Out strolling on Sunday...
--- Unknown ---
George looks around
George is alone
No use denying
George is aground
George has outgrown
What he can do
George would have liked to see
