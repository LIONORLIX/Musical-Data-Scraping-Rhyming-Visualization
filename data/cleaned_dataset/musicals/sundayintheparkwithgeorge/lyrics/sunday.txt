------ Sunday ------
--- All ---
Sunday, by the blue purple yellow red water
On the green purple yellow red grass
Let us pass through our perfect park
Pausing on a Sunday
--- Unknown ---
By the cool blue triangular water
On the soft green elliptical grass
As we pass through arrangements of shadow
Toward the verticals of trees
Forever
--- Unknown ---
By the blue purple yellow red water
On the green orange violet mass of the grass
In our perfect park
--- George ---
Made of flecks of light
And dark
And parasols
Bum bum bum bum bum bum
Bum bum bum
--- Unknown ---
People strolling through the trees
Of a small suburban park
On an island in the river
On and ordinary Sunday
Sunday
