------ The Day Off ------
--- George ---
If the head was smaller...
If the tail were longer...
If he faced the water...
If the paws were hidden...
If the neck was darker...
If the back was curved...
More like the parasol...
--- Unknown ---
Bumbum bum bumbumbum
Bumbum bum...
More shade...
More tail...
More grass!...
Would you like some more grass?
Mmmm...
--- Spot (George) ---
Ruff! Ruff!
Thanks, the week has been rough!
When you're stuck for life on a garbage scow
Only forty feet long from stern to prow
And a crackpot in the bow-wow, rough!
The planks ere rough
And the wind is rough
And the master's drunk and mean and-
Grrrruff! Gruff!
With the fish and scum
And planks end ballast-
The nose gets numb
And the pews Bet callused.
And with splinters in your ass,
You look forward to the grass
On Sunday,
The day off.
Off! Off! Off!
Off!
--- Unknown ---
The grass needs to be thicker. Perhaps a few weeds.
And some ants. if you would. I love fresh ants.
--- Unknown ---
Roaming around on Sunday,
Poking among the roots and rocks.
Nose to the ground on Sunday,
Studying all the shoes and socks.
Everything's worth it Sunday,
The day off.
Bits of pastry...
Piece of chicken...
Here's a handkerchief
That somebody was sick in.
--- Unknown ---
There's a thistle...
That's a shallot...
That's a dripping
From the loony with the palette...
--- Fifi(George) ---
Yap! Yap!
Yap!
Out for the day on Sunday,
Off of my lady's lap at last.
Yapping away on Sunday
Helps you forget the week just past-
Yep! Yep!
Everything's worth it Sunday,
The day off.
Yep!
Stuck all week on a lady's lap.
Nothing to do but yawn and nap.
Can you blame me if I yap?
--- Spot ---
Nope.
--- Fifi ---
There's only so much attention a dog can take.
Being alone on Sunday,
Rolling around in mud and dirt-
--- Spot ---
Begging a bone on Sunday,
Settling for a spoiled dessert-
--- Fifi ---
Everything's worth it
--- Spot ---
Sunday...
--- Fifi ---
The day off.
--- Spot ---
Something fuzzy...
--- Fifi ---
Something furry...
--- Spot ---
Something pink
That someone tore off in a hurry...
--- Fifi ---
What's the muddle
In the middle?
--- Spot ---
That's the puddle
Where the poodle did the piddle.
--- George ---
Taking the day on Sunday,
Now that the dreary week is dead.
Getting away on Sunday
Brightens the dreary week ahead.
Everyone's on display on Sunday-
--- All ---
The day off!
--- George ---
Bonnet flapping.
Bustle sliding,
Like a rocking horse that nobody's been riding
There's a daisy-
And some clover-
And that interesting fellow looking over...
--- Old Lady ---
Nurse!
--- Nurse and George ---
One day is much like any other,
Listening to her snap and drone.
--- Nurse ---
Still, Sunday with someone's dotty mother
Is better then Sunday with your own.
Mothers may drone, mothers may whine-
Tending to his, though, is perfectly fine.
It pays for the nurse that is tending to mine
On Sunday,
My day off.
--- Frieda ---
You know, Franz-I believe that artist is drawing us.
--- Franz ---
Who?
--- Frieda ---
Monsieur's friend.
--- Franz ---
Monsieur would never think to draw us! We are only people he looks down upon.
--- George & Frieda ---
Second bottle...
--- George & Franz ---
Ah, she looks for me...
--- Frieda ---
He is bursting to go...
--- Franz ---
Near the fountain...
--- Frieda ---
I could let him...
--- Franz ---
How to manage it-?
--- Frieda ---
No
--- Franz ---
I should have been an artist. I was never intended for work.
--- Frieda ---
Artists work, Franz. I believe they work very hard.
--- Franz ---
Work!
We work.
--- Unknown ---
We serve their food,
We carve their meat,
We tend to their house,
We polish their
Silverware.
--- Frieda ---
The food we serve
We also eat.
--- Franz ---
For them we rush,
Wash and brush,
Wipe and wax
--- Frieda ---
Franz, relax.
--- Franz ---
While he creates,
We scrape their plates
And dust their knickknacks,
Hundreds to the shelf.
Work is what you do for others,
Liebchen,
Art is what you do for yourself.
--- Celeste #1 ---
Look.
--- Celeste #2 ---
Where?
--- Celeste #1 ---
Soldiers.
--- Celeste #2 ---
Alone.
--- Soldier ---
What do you think?
I like the one in the light hat.
--- Soldier and George ---
Mademoiselles,
I and my friend,
We are but soldiers!
--- Soldier ---
Passing the time
In between wars
For weeks at an end.
--- Celeste #1 ---
Both of them are perfect.
--- Celeste #2 ---
You can have the other.
--- Celeste #1 ---
I don't want the other.
--- Celeste #2 ---
I don't want the other either.
--- Soldier ---
And after a week
Spent mostly indoors
With nothing but soldiers,
Ladies, I and my friend
Trust we will not offend,
Which we'd never intend,
By suggesting we spend-
--- Celestes ---
Oh, spend-
--- Soldier ---
-This magnificent Sunday-
--- Celestes ---
Oh, Sunday-
--- Soldier ---
With you and your friend.
--- Celeste #2 ---
The one on the right's an awful bore...
--- Celeste #1 ---
He's been in a war.
--- Soldier ---
We may get a meal and we might get more...
--- Celestes and Soldier ---
It's certainly fine for Sunday...
It's certainly fine for Sunday...
It's certainly fine for Sunday...
--- George and Boatman ---
You and me, pal,
We're the loonies.
Did you know that?
Bet you didn't know that.
--- Boatman ---
'Cause we tell them the truth!
Who you drawing?
Who the hell you think you're drawing?
Me?
You don't know me!
Go on drawing,
Since you're drawing only what you want to see,
Anyway!
One eye, no illusion-
That you get with two
One for what is true.
One for what suits you.
Draw your wrong conclusion,
All you artists do.
I see what is true...
--- All ---
Taking the day on Sunday
After another week is dead.
--- Old Lady ---
Nurse!
--- All ---
Getting away on Sunday
Brightens the dreary week ahead.
--- Old Lady ---
Nurse!
--- All ---
Leaving the city pressure
Behind you,
Off where the air is fresher,
Where green, blue,
------ fin ------
