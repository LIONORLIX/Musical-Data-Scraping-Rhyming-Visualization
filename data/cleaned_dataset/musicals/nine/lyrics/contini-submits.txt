------ Contini Submits ------
--- Unknown ---
Guido Contini submits that the flops aren?t hits
Because no one is willing
To film a romantic spectacular
That?ll use the vernacular.
And he says furthermore that the present?s a bore,
But historically speaking, more interesting subjects
are myriad in a period.
Period!
Contani contends that the past
Makes the present look dull and half-assed.
Let other directors
Investigate sectors of image and meaning
Once commonly thought of as current,
?Cause they aren?t-and weren?t.
Contani suggests
That today?s not the best,
But that yesterday?s better
And ?longer ago is still betterer.
Et cetera, et cetera.
And now i have found the right location
That perfectly suits this new creation,
A picture so broad and serpentining ,
That it will contain a world of meaning.
And it?s? already here in front of my nose.
This is the answer to what i propose.
Venice by? day-venice by night,
Right where i am is terrific?ly right.
(Speaks) Everybody on the set for rehearsal with
lights!
