------ Be On Your Own ------
--- Unknown ---
Luisa Be on your own.
You?ve? always talked about your need to travel,
Now go off, unravel on your own.
Go find some restaurant attendant,
Go show her how independent you have grown.
Go on...
Be on your way.
There?s not a single reason i can find
To make me want to keep you one more day.
There isn?t any sort of word that you could say.
There isn?t any sort of price that you could pay.
There isn?t any sort of magic
To avoid this tragi-comic little play
We need to play
Be on your way.
Go on...
No need to carry out this masquerade
When all that we?re about?s begun to fade.
I set you free.
There?s not much longer to complain,
I?ll soon relieve you of your pain
When I set you free.
If that is all you wish to have, then I agree.
No need for thanks, your just rewards will be my
fee.
Go off and live your petty fictions
Full of blatant contradictions you can?t see,
And what will be
Is that you?ll leave,
And you?ll take with you all you own
From a to z
... And all of me.
