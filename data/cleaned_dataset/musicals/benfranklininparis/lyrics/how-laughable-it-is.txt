------ How Laughable It Is ------
--- Unknown ---
Oh. How Laughable it is,
that you always adore the very one
You never can live with;
And how laughable it is
when your love's not returned,
You face a fact and that's what you live with
In a lifetime.
What a joke on people is human feeling
That lets them thrill before the kill
That leaves them reeling
How laughable it is
That my heart runs to hug the very love
That never can ever be.
I have ev'rything my life requires,
Except the thing my heart desires;
Someone who can make me dependent and free;
