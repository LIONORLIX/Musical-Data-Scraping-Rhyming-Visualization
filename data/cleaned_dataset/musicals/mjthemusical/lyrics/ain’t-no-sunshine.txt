------ Ainâ€™t No Sunshine ------
--- Unknown ---
You ever want something
That you know you shouldn't have
The more you know you shouldn't have it
The more you want it
And then one day you get it
It is so good too
But it is just like my girl
When she is around me
I just feel so good, so good
But right now I just feel cold, so cold
Right down to my bones
Because ooh
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
It is not warm when she is away
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And she is always gone too long
Anytime she goes away
Wonder this time where she is gone
Wonder if she is going to stay
Ain't no sunshine when she is gone
And this house just is no home
Anytime she goes away
I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, know, know, know, know
I know, I know
Hey I ought to leave
I ought to leave her alone
Ain't no sunshine when she is gone
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
Only darkness every day
Ain't no sunshine when she is gone
And this house just is no home
Anytime she goes away
