------ Johnny Raven ------
--- Unknown ---
Free and untamed
That's how I've grown
Settling down ain't my nature
Roots I'll never own
Oh your smile
Mm, mm
But tell me, angel child
How can you cage a bird
Born to be wild
I'm Johnny Raven
By and by
Oh, I'm going to leave your nest girl
Another nest to try
Ooh Johnny Raven
Girl you know I shouldn't have loved you
Yeah, but I gotta leave you
When my restless heart says goodbye
Look at you little girl
You feel love so deep
Yeah, yeah
If I could change in a second
I'd change for you like that
Stay right here for keeps
But I'm home free for no thrills
Stray I will
Seems I gotta need one girl
Never can feel
Yeah I'm Johnny Raven
By and by
I'm going to leave your nest girl
Another nest to try
Ooh Johnny Raven
Girl you know I shouldn't have loved you
Yeah, but I gotta leave you
When my restless heart says goodbye
Everybody knows my name
I'm Johnny Raven yeah, yeah, by and by
Ooh, I'm gonna fly
When you cry part of me's gonna die
Ooh, I'm Johnny Raven, yeah, yeah
By and by
I'm gonna fly, and when you cry, yeah
A part of me's gonna die
