------ You Rock My World ------
--- Unknown ---
Darkchild, I like that
Oh, oh, oh
My life will never be the same
'Cause girl you came and changed
The way I walk
The way I talk
I cannot explain
These things I feel for you
But girl, you know it's true
Stay with me
Fulfill my dreams
And I'll be all you need
Feels so right (girl)
I've searched for the perfect love all my life
Oh, oh, oh, ooh, feels like I (like I)
Have finally found a perfect love this time (and I finally found)
Come on, girl
You rocked my world, you know you did
And everything I own I give
The rarest love who'd think I'd find
Someone like you to call mine
You rocked my world, you know you did
And everything I own I give
The rarest love who'd think I'd find
Someone like you to call mine
My mind
I knew that love would bring
Such happiness I'm in
I tried to keep my sanity
I've waited patiently
Girl, you know it seems
My life is so complete
A love that's true because of you
Keep doing what you do
Oh, oh, oh, oh, ooh, think that I
Finally found the perfect love I've searched for all my life (searched for all my life)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, ooh, who's think I'd find
Such a perfect love that's awesomely so right
Oh, oh, oh, girl
You rocked my world, you know you did (come on, come on, come on)
Everything I own I give
The rarest love who'd think I'd find (girl)
Someone like you to call mine
You rocked my world, you know you did
And everything I own I give (Girl)
The rarest love who'd think I'd find (Girl, girl)
Someone like you to call mine
You rocked my world, you know you did
And everything I own I give
The rarest love who'd think I'd find
Someone like you to call mine
You rocked my world, you know you did
And everything I own I give
The rarest love who'd think I'd find
Someone like you to call mine
And girl, I know that this is love
I felt the magic's all in the air
And girl, I'll never get enough
That's why I always have to have you here, woo!
You rocked my world, you know you did
Everything I own I give (look what you did to me, baby)
The rarest love who'd think I'd find
Someone like you to call mine (you, you, you, you)
You rocked my world, you know you did (know you did baby)
And everything I own I give ('cause you rock my world)
The rarest love who'd think I'd find
Someone like you to call mine
The way you talk to me
The way you're loving me
The way you, you give it to me
Yeah, yeah
You, you, yeah, yeah, woo
You rock my world
You rock my world,
You rock my world,
Come on, girl,
You rocked my world, you know you did
And everything I own I give
The rarest love who'd think I'd find
Someone like you to call mine
You rocked my world, you know you did
And everything I own I give
The rarest love who'd think I'd find
Someone like you to call mine
