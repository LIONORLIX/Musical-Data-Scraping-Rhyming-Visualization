------ Will You Be There ------
--- Unknown ---
Hold me
Like the River Jordan
And I will then say to thee
You are my friend
Carry me
Like you are my brother
Love me like a mother
Will you be there?
Weary, tell me will you hold me?
When wrong, will you scold me?
When lost will you find me?
But they told me
A man should be faithful
And walk when not able
And fight 'til the end, but I'm only human
Everyone's taking control of me
Seems that the world's got a role for me
I'm so confused will you show it to me
You'll be there for me
And care enough to bear me
Hold me (show me)
Lay your head lowly (told me)
Softly then boldly (yeah)
Carry me there (I'm only human)
Lead me (hold me)
Love me and feed me (lead again)
Kiss me and free me (yeah)
I will feel blessed (I'm only human)
Carry (carry)
Carry me boldly (carry, yeah)
Lift me up slowly (yeah)
Carry me there (I'm only human)
Save me (lift me)
Heal me and bathe me (lift me up, lift me up)
Softly you say to me
I will be there (I will be there)
Lift me (told me, yeah)
Lift me up slowly
Carry me boldly (yeah)
Show me you care (will you be there?)
Hold me (woo)
Lay your head lowly (get lonely sometimes)
Softly then boldly (I get lonely, yeah, yeah)
Carry me there (will you be there?)
Need me (woo)
Love me and feed me (lift me up, hold me up)
Kiss me and free me (lift me up sometimes, up sometimes)
I will feel blessed (oh-yeah)
