------ Dear Michael ------
--- Unknown ---
She wrote "Dear Michael
You'll probably never get this letter
Michael, I wrote you a hundred times before
Knowing how I feel
I'll write a hundred more
Dear Michael, every time your record's on
Michael, I close my eyes and sing along
Dreaming you're singing to me.
And then she wrote,
Michael, I love you
I held the tears back long as I can
I'm sealing my feelings in this envelope
'Cause I want to be more than just your number one fan
I'm gonna answer your letter
I'll start beginning with the ABC's of loving you
Your letter really touched my heart
I've been dreaming of meeting the picture
That you send along, signed with all your love
I'm gonna write you back, ouuh, I promess you that
Girl, I think I love you
Hurry, hurry mister postman, take my letter, tell her I love her
Hurry, hurry mister postman, take my letter tell her I love her
Yeah,
I'm gonna write you back
I promess you that
