------ In the Closet ------
--- Unknown ---
There's something I have to say to you
If you promise you'll understand
I cannot contain myself
When in your presence
I'm so humble
Touch me
Don't hide our love
Woman to man
She's just a lover
Who's doin' me by
Is it worth the giving?
Is it worth the try?
You cannot cleave it
Or put it in the furnace
You cannot wet it
You cannot burn it
She wants to give it
Dare me
She wants to give it
It's just a feeling
You have to soothe it
You can't neglect it
You can't abuse it
It's just desire
You cannot waste It
Then if you want it
Then won't you taste it
She wants to give it
Dare me
One thing in life you must understand
The truth of lust woman to man
So open the door and you will see
There are no secrets
Make your move
Set me free
Aah because
There's something about you baby
That makes me want
To give it to you
I swear there's something about you baby
Just promise me whatever we say
Or whatever we do to each other
For now we'll make a vow
To just
Keep it in the closet
If you can get it
Is it worth the try?
I really want it
I can't deny
It's just desire
I really love it
'Cause if it's aching
You have to rub it
She wants to give it
Just open the door and you will see
This passion burns inside of me
Don't say to me you'll never tell
Touch me there
Make the move
Cast the spell
Aah because there's something about you baby
That makes me want
To give it to you
I swear there's something about you baby
That makes me want
Just promise me whatever we say
Or do to each other
For now we'll make a vow to just
Keep it in the closet
Because there's
Something about you baby
That makes me want
To give it to You
Because there's
Something about you baby
That makes me want
To give it to you
I swear there's
Something about you baby
That makes me want
To give it to you
I swear there's
Something about you baby
That makes me want
To give it to you
I swear there's
Something about you baby
That makes me want
To give it to you
Somethin' about you baby
That makes me want
Just promise me whatever we say
Or whatever we do to each other
For now we'll make a vow
To just
Keep it in the closet
- Dare Me
(She wants to give it) - Dare Me
Keep it in the closet ...
Keep it in the closet
(She wants to give it) - Dare me
