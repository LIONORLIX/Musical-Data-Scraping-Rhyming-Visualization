------ Shall We Dance? ------
--- Bobby ---
Drop that long face!  Come on, have your
fling!
Why keep nursing the blues?
If you want this old world on a string,
Put on your dancing shoes -
Stop wasting time!
Put on your dancing shoes -
Watch your spirits climb.
Shall we dance, or keep on moping?
Shall we dance, and walk on air?
Shall we give into despair -
Or shall we dance with never a care?
Life is short; we're growing older.
Don't you be an also-ran.
You'd better dance, little lady!
Dance, little man!
