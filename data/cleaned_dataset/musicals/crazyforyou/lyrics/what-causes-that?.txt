------ What Causes That? ------
--- Zangler ---
She's so full of trickery,
Life is bitter as chicory,
Bitterness fills my cup.
--- Bobby ---
I'm sorry you brought that up.
Once I thought I'd search around
For the little church around
The corner, but now I see.
--- Both ---
It never was meant to be.
--- Zangler ---
Once she used to praise me.
--- Bobby ---
Why is she so high hat?
--- Zangler ---
Boy, does she amaze me.
--- Both ---
Tell me what causes that?!
--- Bobby ---
When I'm away from her I start despairing.
--- Zangler ---
You ought to know by now what causes that!
I'm growing balder from the hair I'm tearing.
--- Bobby ---
You ought to know by now what causes that!
When she keeps on brushing you aside
Oh gosh, you're all at sea!
You go contemplating suicide --
It's much too much for me!
You're not so dumb that you don't know the answer.
Loving her is what causes that!
--- Zangler ---
If I should climb the Brooklyn Bridge and jump off.
--- Bobby ---
Oh, I suppose you'd ask what causes that?
If I should get a gun and bump this chump off.
--- Zangler ---
Oh, I suppose you'd ask what causes that?
--- Both ---
Really you don't have to mope around
And burn up as you do,
There's a cannon and rope around,
There's lots of poison too!
I'm very blue of late and there's a reason:
--- Zangler ---
Loving her...
--- Bobby ---
Loving her...
--- Both ---
Is what causes that!
I'm very blue of late and there's a reason:
Loving her is what causes that!
...Is what causes that!
...Is what causes that!
