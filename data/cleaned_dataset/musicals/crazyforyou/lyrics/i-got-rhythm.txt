------ I Got Rhythm ------
--- Polly ---
Days can be sunny
With never a sigh,
Don't need what money
Can buy.
Birds in the tree sing
Their dayful of song.
Why shouldn't we sing
Along?
I'm chipper al the day,
Happy with my lot.
How did I get that way?
Look at what I've got.

I got rhythm,
I got music,
I got my man --
Who could ask for anything more?
I got daisies
In green pastures,
I got my man --
Who could ask for anything more?
I got daisies
In green pastures,
I got my man --
Who could ask for anything more?
Old man trouble,
I don't mind him --
You won't find him
'Round my door
I got starlight,
I got sweet dreams,
I got my man --
Who could ask for anything more --
Who could ask for anything more?!
