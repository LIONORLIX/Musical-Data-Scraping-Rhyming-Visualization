------ I Can't Be Bothered Now ------
--- Bobby ---
Bad news go 'way!
Call 'round some day
In March or May -
I can't be bothered now.
My bonds and shares
May falI downstairs -
Who cares, who cares?
I'm dancing and I can't be bothered now!
I'm up among the stars;
On earthly things I frown
I'm throwing off the bars
That held me down.
I'll pay the piper
When times are riper.
Just now I shan't -
Because you see I'm dancing and I can't -
be bothered now!
Music is the magic
That makes ev'rything sunshiny
Dancing makes my troubles all seem tiny
When I m dancing I don't care
If this old world stops turning,
Or if my bank is burning,
Or even if Rumania
Wants to figh Albania!
I'm not upset, And I refuse to fret.

He's not upset
