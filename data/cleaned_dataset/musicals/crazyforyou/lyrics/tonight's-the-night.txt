------ Tonight's the Night ------
--- The Company ---
I've just got a feeling
Tonight's the night!
Let's tear down the ceiling --
Tonight's the night!
Take the chain and ball off,
For now on I'm free;
This is where I fall off
The family tree.
There's no fun in being an angel child --
I hear the call of the wild
If the worst should happen, it serves me right,
------ fin ------
