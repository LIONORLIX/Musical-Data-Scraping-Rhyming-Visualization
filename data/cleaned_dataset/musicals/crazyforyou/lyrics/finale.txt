--- Tess ---
Drop that long face.  Have your fling.
--- Mingo, Wyatt and Billy ---
Why keep nursing the blues?
--- Patsy, Zangler and Tess ---
If you want this old world on a string.
--- Lank, Everett, The Fodors, Irene and Mother ---
Put on your dancing shoes --
Stop wasting time!
Put on your dancing shoes --
--- The Company ---
Watch your spirits climb!
--- The Boys ---
I'm up among the stars;
On earthly things I frown.
--- The Company ---
I'm throwing off the bars
That held me down.
Who could ask for anything more?!
--- The Boys ---
Let me give you the low down:
I'm k-ra-zy for you.
When it comes to show down --
I'm k-ra-zy for you.
And so, though love may not inspire my lingo.
Still it's making my heart go
Bango!  Bingo!
--- The Company ---
Embrace me,
My sweet embraceable you,
Embrace me
You irreplaceable you
Don't be a naughty baby;
--- Polly ---
Come to Polly --
--- Bobby ---
Come to Bobby --
--- Polly and Bobby ---
Do!
--- The Company ---
My sweet embraceable you.
--- Unknown ---
Old man trouble
I don't mind him --
You won't find him
I got starlight
I got sweet dreams,
I got my man/gal --
Who could ask for anything more?
Who could ask for anything more?!
