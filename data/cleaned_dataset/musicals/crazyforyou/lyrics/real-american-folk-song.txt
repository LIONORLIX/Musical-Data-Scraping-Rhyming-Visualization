------ Real American Folk Song ------
--- Mingo, Moose and Sam ---
The real American folk song is a rag,
A mental jag
A rhythmic tonic for the chronic blues
The critics called it a joke song
But now
They've changed their tune
And they like it somehow
For it's inoculated
With a synopated sort of meter,
Sweeter
Than a classic strain
Boy!  You can't remain
Still and quiet
For it's a riot!
The real American folk song
Is like a fountain of youth;
You taste,
And it elates you.
And then, invigorates you.
The real American folk song,
Master stroke song,
Is a rag.
The real American folk song
Is like the fountain of youth;
You taste,
And it elates you,
And then, invigorates you.
