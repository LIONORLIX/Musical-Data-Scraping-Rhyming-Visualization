------ Slap That Bass ------
--- Bobby ---
Zoom - zoom, zoom - zoom,
The world is in a mess.
With politics and taxes
And people grinding axes,
There's no happiness
Zoom - zoom, zoom - zoom,
Rhythm lead your ace!
The future doesn't fret me
If I can only get me
Someone to slap that bass
--- Pete ---
Happiness is not a riddle
When I'm list'ning to that big bass fiddle.

Slap it till it's dizzy.

Dictators would be better off
If they zoom-zoomed now and then;
--- Pete ---
Today you can see that the happiest of men

All got rhythm.

In which case,
If you want to bubble -
--- Bobby ---
Slap that bass;
Slap away your trouble.
