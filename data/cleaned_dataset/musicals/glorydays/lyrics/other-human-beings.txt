------ Other Human Beings ------
--- Jack ---
There are certain things
You never do
To other human beings
That no one needs to learn
Because it's part of who we are
--- Unknown ---
But you don't understand
Do you
I mean other human beings
Cause if you did you'd see
That you just went too far
--- Unknown ---
Cause we have the ability to choose
What we make a person feel
So take responsibility for who you lose
When the pain you inflict
Becomes real
--- Unknown ---
So before you go
You should know
That other human beings
Do not accept
When you talk like that to a friend
--- Unknown ---
So as one of them
Watch what you do
To other human beings
--- Andy ---
Look who's speaking out
Like he knows about
Other human beings
Just put the blame on me
And do whatever you want
--- Jack ---
You had the ability to choose
What you were going to make me feel
Andy:
You don't care how I feel
--- Jack ---
So take responsibility for who you lose
When the pain you inflict becomes real
Andy:
So why should I care what I say to you
--- Jack ---
So before I go
You should know
Andy:
No I think you should know
--- Jack and Andy ---
That other human beings
Don't fuck with each other
--- Jack ---
Unless they want to lose each other
--- Unknown ---
And you
Just lost me
