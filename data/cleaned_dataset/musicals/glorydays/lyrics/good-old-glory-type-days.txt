Look
We are still the boys
Freshman year
We were queer
--- Unknown ---
Sorry
We were different
Forgot you're gay now
--- Jack ---
You weigh the same that you did back then
But you were 5 foot 4
Now you're 5 foot 10
Well at least 5' 9
Well at least you're taller
--- Skip ---
Look whose talking
About being an awkward mess
You were so gangely
Your arms just dangled
They wrapped around twice
When you fold them across your chest
--- Andy ---
I was strong
--- Jack ---
But you were dumb
--- Skip ---
Still are
--- Andy ---
Shut up
--- Will ---
You are
--- Will and Andy ---
Your mom
--- Will, Andy, Jack and Skip ---
See
Man this brings me back to those
Good old glory type days
--- Will ---
We would run from bullies
--- Jack ---
When we would hide in trashcans
--- Skip ---
When all they wanted to do was
--- Will, Andy, Skip and Jack ---
Put us in one
--- Andy ---
And we'd say we had girlfriends
--- Will ---
But nobody could meet them
--- Jack ---
Cause they were online
--- Skip ---
And probably men
--- Will, Andy, Skip and Jack ---
Man this brings me
Back to things I
Haven't thought about
Since those good old glory type days
--- Will ---
Hey what about you
Mr. You-Know-Who
Junior ROTC
--- Skip ---
Yeah that was me
It was my dad's plan
But I got something out of it
I could end your life with my bare hands
--- Will ---
Fuck you bring it on
--- Andy ---
Watch out are you nuts
--- Jack ---
Don't fight come on guys
--- Skip ---
You're mine
--- Will, Andy, Skip and Jack ---
See this is what the
Good old days should be like
--- Jack ---
Football in the lights
--- Will ---
Pizza every night
--- Andy ---
Horse face every night
--- Skip ---
Street Fighter 2
--- Will, Andy, Skip and Jack ---
Are the things that remind me of you
And me
And here
--- Unknown ---
Dreamin' of amazing things
And new ideas that we would bring
To a world that isn't growing
Isn't going where it could be
--- Unknown ---
Life isn't about what is
But what should be
Generation You and Me and Here
--- Will ---
Good old glory days
Always seem to say goodbye
--- Skip ---
And they become the past tense
Which we apply to our lives
--- Andy ---
The good old days
Are only good when you're there
--- Jack ---
And when they're done they're not as fun
Even though you still do care
--- Unknown ---
Man I miss those
--- Skip ---
Ugly gym clothes
--- Andy ---
Will's big Jew nose
--- Will ---
Andy's sister's pantyhose
--- Jack ---
Man I miss those
--- Skip ---
High School dance woes
--- Andy ---
Bathroom peep shows
--- Will ---
Watching us grow
--- Unknown ---
Man I miss those
--- Jack ---
Man I miss those
--- Skip and Andy ---
Man I miss those
--- Will, Andy, Jack and Skip ---
Good old glory type
--- Unknown ---
Man I miss those
Good old glory type days
