------ My Next Story ------
--- Will ---
Look at this field
Look at this perfect field
What really keeps people here
These white lines
No boundaries to hold us here
Except for mine
--- Unknown ---
It might be time to try and find
A different kind of story
Instead of one that I've begun
But can't seem to complete
'Cept this is all I know
And I don't know where else to go
Or what else there is to me
--- Unknown ---
If they're not gonna be
In my next story
--- Unknown ---
They say to write the things you know
Well that I have and there they go
Away from here
No way to sew them back together
I wanna say I'm sorry for
My indiscretions from before
But no one's here to hear anymore
And bring us back together
--- Unknown ---
I didn't want to get it when
Shifting started to occur
I didn't want to let it make us
Who we are from who we were
--- Unknown ---
But there really would be something good
If I could write a story
With no conversions of versions of myself
I hate to be
And this draft that I do
Will be completely true
Which seems quite overdue to me
--- Unknown ---
But that doesn't mean I see
My next story
--- Unknown ---
Let's see
I'm making mistakes
And each one takes me
In a totally different direction
I'm getting lost
And finding out the cost of
Pushing too hard to make a connection
When am I grown up
And when am I still immature
Will I ever be more than just
Unsure
--- Unknown ---
And when am I a man
And when I am
Will I still just be doing the best that  I can
--- Unknown ---
When I was the glue that held us together
Observer, Inventor and Soul documenter
Constantly watching
With constant incentive
To keep moving forward
And always remember
--- Unknown ---
Always remember
--- Unknown ---
I don't know how
But starting now
I vow to tell a story
That takes account of the amount
I don't tell truthfully
But still can find a way
To say this is only who I am today
And there's so much more to see
Right here
--- Unknown ---
In my story
And who knows what that will be
But it will be
