------ Are You Ready? ------
--- Will ---
Are you ready for tonight
Are you ready to make history
Right here on this football field, you and me
--- Unknown ---
And two other guys
Who could show up at any time
Whenever they do get here, I?m hoping you?re ready
--- Skip ---
(Spoken) What are we doing?
--- Will ---
I can?t tell you that
--- Skip ---
Why not?
--- Will ---
?Cause I don?t know if I can trust you
--- Skip ---
Just tell me!
--- Will ---
Not yet!
When the timing is right
We all will be here finally
When we are you?ll finally see
What this highschool means to me
--- Skip ---
How about a hint
--- Will ---
How about we wait for all the guys.
--- Skip ---
I?ll act like I?m still surprised
--- Will ---
Fine, do you like water rides?
--- Skip ---
Like slip and slides?
--- Will ---
Yep!
--- Skip ---
Really?
--- Will ---
No.
--- Skip ---
Come on!
--- Will ---
Don?t even try to guess
You won?t be able to
?Cause what we?re gonna do
Is gonna dumbfound even you
--- Andy ---
Ah, please dude! Batman is so much cooler! He?s got all those gadgets and shit!
--- Jack ---
Andy
--- Andy ---
Will, help me outta here! Batman v. Superman, who wins?
--- Will ---
Superman
--- Andy ---
Fuck that!
--- Skip ---
Jack!
--- Will ---
Are you ready for tonight
--- Jack ---
Can you believe we?re back out here
--- Will ---
It has been the longest year
--- Jack ---
I gotta say, it?s pretty weird
--- Will ---
How is life at school
--- Jack ---
Probably the same as you
--- Will ---
There is no way that?s true
unless you room with Andy too
--- Andy ---
How the hell could you think that Batman
would lose a battle to a guy in tights
Haven?t you seen those gay-red
undies he wears outside of his pants
--- Skip ---
I don?t even know why you ever begin
to argue with me when you know you?ll never win
Batman is human and superman?s not
So who?s gonna die when one of them gets shot
--- Andy ---
What?s your point?
--- Will ---
So! Are you ready for tonight
--- Skip ---
What the hell is going on
--- Will ---
Have I ever steered you wrong
--- Skip ---
I don?t know. It?s been so long
--- Will ---
Just get ready for tonight
What a night it?s gonna be
you and you and you and me
--- All ---
Finally
--- Will ---
Back together
--- Jack ---
I missed you guys
--- Andy ---
You only like Superman ?cause he flies
--- Will:             Other Guys ---
Now are you ready for   Ready for
Ready for               Tonight
--- All ---
Right here!
