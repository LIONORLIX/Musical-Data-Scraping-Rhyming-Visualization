------ After All ------
--- Will ---
When I feel alone
I have these friends of mine
The other halves of me
Who keep me sane in troubled times
And when I lose my way
I have them there in the back of my mind
And then I don't feel lonely after all
--- Unknown ---
When I was young I only had myself
To guide my lifeless action figures
To the floor down from the shelf
My bedroom was my playground
To draw and write and pray
That I would find some real friends
To guide me someday
--- Unknown ---
And now
When I feel alone
I have these friends of mine
The other halves of me
Who keep me sane in troubled times
And when I lose my way
I have them there in the back of my mind
And then I don't feel lonely
--- Unknown ---
So when I lose my way
Would they even care
Since when they went away
They were never there
And when I lose my way
Where are they when I am lonely
Well nobody asked me if we're allowed to change
--- Unknown ---
Maybe I'm the only one
Who stayed the same
--- Unknown ---
And now
I am still alone
With all these friends of mine
The other halves of me
Who ran away in troubled times
And now I feel the shame
Of holding on to what's no longer mine
Maybe things are different
After all
--- Unknown ---
And I just never saw it
At all
