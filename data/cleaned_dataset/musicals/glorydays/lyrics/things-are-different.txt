------ Things Are Different ------
--- Andy ---
Don't look at me that way
I'm not crazy
I don't really care how you'd like me to feel
Now if it doesn't bother you that he's changing, fine
But don't pretend that this is not a bigger deal
Jack is go---
--- Will ---
You are out of line
Just so you know
He's your friend and that's the end of it
--- Andy ---
If you won't let me talk then I should go
--- Will ---
No, I just think that you might have to bend a bit
--- Unknown ---
Why should anything change just cause he's opened up
We should be glad that he's letting us in
It's been a long time
It'll just take some more
To work in our old way,
Okay?
--- Andy ---
He is different, Will
It's kinda hard not to see
Now if you're okay, then that's okay
But don't tell me that I have to be
--- Will ---
Why are you mad
We're gonna be fine
This only changes what you let it change
--- Andy ---
Don't try and act like this problem is mine
--- Will ---
Well everyone else is still acting the same
So why greet that change
By causing him pain
--- Andy ---
I don't want to hurt him
--- Will ---
Can't you see that this will
--- Andy ---
Will you listen to me
--- Will ---
Your his friend you should try to understand him
Andy:
Why don't you understand Me?
--- Will ---
This isn't wrong, Andy
This is just new
You can't right off Jack cause he's different from you
--- Andy ---
Don't make it sound like I'm wrong
I wish we could be what we used to be for so long
--- Unknown ---
But things are different, Will
It's kinda hard not to pay
When Jack is the reason that we
Don't feel the same
Now it's just you and me and Skip
We'll work as three
Will:
You are not wrong
But no way resisting he's growing up
You will be fine if you grow with him
Jack never said that you have to live
Your life one way
Let no one divide us he is your friend
Or this could be
--- Unknown ---
Andy: Not four anymore
Will: Not four anymore
--- Andy ---
What are you asking me to do
--- Will ---
Just let it go
--- Andy ---
Is this for him or for you
--- Will ---
Let it go
--- Andy ---
Why are you putting this on me
--- Will ---
Look I'm not saying I disagree
But please for me
Keep quiet
--- Andy ---
Fine
--- Will ---
Fine
