------ I Still See Elisa ------
--- Unknown ---
I still see Elisa
She keeps on returning
As breathless, young as ever
--- Unknown ---
I still see Elisa
And still feel the yearning
To hold her against me again
--- Unknown ---
Her heart was made of holidays
Her smile was made of dawn
Her laughter was an April song
That echoes on and on
--- Unknown ---
Since I saw Elisa
The shadows are falling
And winter is calling above
But I still see Elisa
