Mariah
Mariah
They call the wind Mariah
--- Unknown ---
Away out here they got a name
For rain and wind and fire
The rain is Tess, the fire Joe,
And they call the wind Mariah
--- Unknown ---
Mariah blows the stars around
And sends the clouds a-flyin?
Mariah makes the mountains sound
Like folks were up there dying
--- Unknown ---
Mariah
Mariah
They call the wind Mariah
--- Unknown ---
Before I knew Mariah's name
And heard her wail and whinin?
I had a girl and she had me
And the sun was always shinin?
--- Unknown ---
But then one day I left my girl
I left her far behind me
And now I'm lost, so gone and lost
Not even God can find me
--- Unknown ---
Mariah
Mariah
They call the wind Mariah
--- Unknown ---
Out here they got a name for rain
For wind and fire only
But when you're lost and all alone
There ain't no word but lonely
--- Unknown ---
And I'm a lost and lonely man
Without a star to guide me
Mariah blow my love to me
I need my girl beside me
--- Unknown ---
Mariah
Mariah
They call the wind Mariah
--- Unknown ---
Mariah
Mariah!
