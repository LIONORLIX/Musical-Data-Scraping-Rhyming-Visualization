------ I Talk to the Trees ------
--- Unknown ---
I talk to the trees
But they don't listen to me
I talk to the stars
But they never hear me
--- Unknown ---
The breeze hasn't time
To stop, and hear what I say
I talk to them all
In vain
--- Unknown ---
But suddenly, my words
Reach someone elses ear
At someone elses heart
Strings too
--- Unknown ---
I tell you my dreams
And while you're listening to me
I suddenly see them
Come true
--- Unknown ---
I can see us some April night
Looking out across a rollin' farm
Having supper in the candlelight
Walking later, arm in arm
--- Unknown ---
Then I'll tell you
How I pass the day
Thinking mainly how
The night would be
--- Unknown ---
Then I'll try to find
The words to say
All the things you
Mean to me
--- Unknown ---
I tell you my dreams
And while you're
Listening to me
I suddenly see them
