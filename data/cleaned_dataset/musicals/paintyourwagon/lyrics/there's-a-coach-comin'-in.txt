------ There's a Coach Comin' In ------
--- Unknown ---
There's a coach comin' in!
There's a coach comin' in!
Comin in!
Comin in!
Comin in!
Comin in!
Comin in!
--- Unknown ---
There's a coach comin' in
If you listen you can hear it
A clip-cloppin' over the hill
And the sound that you hear
Is as good to your ear
As the call of a wild whippoorwill
--- Unknown ---
There's a coach comin' in
You can feel it gettin' near
All at once then it bursts into view
And it looks to your eye
Like it fell from the sky
Like a coach full of dreams come true
--- Unknown ---
For it's bringin' me eyes that are moonlight
And it's carryin' lips that are wine (kiss sound)
And it's comin' with arms that are pillows
And this evening it all will be mine
--- Unknown ---
There's a coach comin' in
And you're smellin' like a steer
Yet the soap tub remains far away
Cut the socks from your feet
Cut the socks from your feet
Rake your hair till it's neat
Rake your hair till it's neat
There's a coach comin' in
There's a coach comin' in today!
--- Unknown ---
There's a coach comin' in
Hurry! Hurry! Do ya hear?
With a cargo of joy from Paree
Drop the tables and chairs
Get them beds up the stairs
And be sure every lock has a key
--- Instrumental ---
--- Unknown ---
For it's coming with girls who buy perfume
Who wear powder and rouge from Paree
Who will have to go somewhere to get them
And that somewhere to go, will be me
--- Unknown ---
There's a coach comin' in
And it's flyin' like a deer
Thank the Lord, there's relief on the way
Thank with all of your hearts
Thank with all of your hearts
For them half dozen tarts
For them half dozen tarts
There's a coach comin' in
There's a coach comin in today!
--- Unknown ---
There's a coach comin' in
If you listen you can hear it
A clip-cloppin' over the hill
And the sound that you hear
Is as good to the ear
As the call of the wild whippoorwill
--- Instrumental ---
--- Unknown ---
For it's bringin' me eyes that are moonlight
And it's carryin' lips that are wine
It's comin' with arms that are pillows
And this evening it all will be mine
--- Instrumental ---
--- Unknown ---
There's a coach comin' in
If you listen you can hear it
A clip, up and over the hill
And the sound that you hear
Is as good to your ear
As the call of the wild whippoorwill
--- Unknown ---
There's a coach comin' in
You can feel it gettin' near
All at once, then it bursts into view
And it looks to your eye
Like it fell from the sky
Like a coach full of dreams come true
--- Unknown ---
For it's bringin' me eyes that are moonlight
And it's carryin' lips that are wine
And it's comin' with arms that are pillows
And this evening it all will be mine
--- Unknown ---
There's a coach comin' in
Now it's flyin' in the clear
And the sun almost closes the day
Now there ain't pots of gold
Now they're all livin' gold
There's a coach comin' in
There's a coach comin' in
