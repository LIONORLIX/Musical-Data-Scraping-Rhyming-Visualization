Mr. Rumson went to town
Riding on a pony
Bought a wife and brought her home
And called it matrimony
--- Unknown ---
Mr. Rumson bought a bride
Out in Californee
He'd of saved alot of money
Staying drunk and horny
--- Unknown ---
Oh, Susanna, he's happy as can be
For he's got him something
Better than a banjo on his knee
--- Unknown ---
Rumson, he got married today
Married today, married today
Rumson, he got married today
What'll he do tomorrow?
--- Unknown ---
Get the soap man water, whoop-ti-ay!
Get the soap man water, whoop-ti-ay!
Got a sweet perfumer
To dry his humor
It's Ben's wedding day
--- Unknown ---
Wash him down and flip him, whoop-ti-ay!
Wash him down and flip him, whoop-ti-ay!
He's got a blue-eyed wonder
To pull him under
--- Unknown ---
It's Ben's wedding
His wedding
His wedding day
