------ The Way Things Are ------
--- L ---
Every fact that I thought I knew
Is subverting me
Deserting me
Every truth I was sure was true
Is on shaky ground
Has come unwound
--- Unknown ---
What if the things I see
Are not as they appear
Are impossible, yet clear
How can I deny it?
--- Unknown ---
Always only believed what was
Right in front of me
What I could see
Shinigami are real because
It's the only way
The only way
--- Unknown ---
When all other explanations
Really don't explain
No matter how insane
You are left with only
--- Unknown ---
The cold, hard truth
Can't shut it down
You can't change it
You can't turn it off
Or turn it 'round
Can't rearrange it
--- Unknown ---
The cold, hard truth
A ragged scar
To remind you never forget
The way things are
--- Unknown ---
I won't let who I used to be
How I used to think
Get me out of sync
I'll turn into a different me
Not so cynical
Not so clinical
--- Unknown ---
Light is willing to risk it all
Defying all the odds
If I must, I'll fight the gods
'Til our war is over
--- Unknown ---
The cold, hard truth
Can't lock it out
You can't change it
True or false, no
Shadow of a doubt
Can't rearrange it
--- Unknown ---
The cold, hard truth
Is my north star
So I know I'll live and I'll die
The way things are
--- Unknown ---
Frame by frame
I see this movie in black and white
Shot by shot
Minute by minute, just me and Light
--- Unknown ---
The cold, hard truth
The way things are
I can't change it
Even if the truth
Seems too bizarre
I can't change it
--- Unknown ---
The cold, hard truth
Is my north star
So no matter what he might try
Shake the heavens
Shatter the sky
I know we must both live and die
