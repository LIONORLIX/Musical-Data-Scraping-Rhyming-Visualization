------ Change the World ------
--- Light ---
It's gotta be a joke, of course
Some fed-up cop who left the force
Or some civilian psychopath
Whose righteous wrath may be the source
--- Unknown ---
(dialogue interlude)
--- Unknown ---
But what would happen if it's true?
Imagine all that I could do
For with such power, I could change
And rearrange the world anew
--- Unknown ---
(dialogue interlude)
--- Unknown ---
If there's the slightest chance it's true
I'll write his name, what else can I do?
--- Chorus (spoken) ---
Forty...
Thirty-nine...
Thirty-eight...
--- Light ---
Now maybe justice sure and swift
Will become my clear-cut gift
To a system ripe for saving
--- Unknown ---
Now let the Death Note play its part
And become a work of art
For the justice we're all craving
--- Chorus (spoken) ---
Four...
Three...
Two...
