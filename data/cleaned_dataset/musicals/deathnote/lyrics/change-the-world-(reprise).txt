------ Change the World (Reprise) ------
--- Aizawa ---
What can I do? What can I say?
How can I go when I should stay?
I have a family I must face
How can I place them in harm's way?
--- Ukita ---
I have a family, just like you
But also Kira to pursue
I can't stop now and walk away
I've got to stay and see it through
--- Ide ---
Why should we make our families pay
Risking all for some clich√©
'Stead of food upon the table?
--- Unknown ---
I have a son who needs his dad
Not a widowed mom too sad
To provide more than a fable
--- Mogi ---
I have a daughter of my own
Who, although she's almost grown
Is the reason I am staying
--- Unknown ---
For, if not us, then who, I ask
Will be equal to the task
And will pay a price worth paying?
--- Matsuda ---
We all must do what we must do
And to our truest selves be true
This will no doubt be my last case
--- Ukita ---
So face to face, let's see it through
--- Ide ---
The choice is ours, you heard the boss
--- Matsuda ---
Go on and leave, it's no big loss!
--- Ide ---
Okay, I will, the choice is mine!
