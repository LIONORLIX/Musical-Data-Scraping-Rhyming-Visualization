------ Where is the Justice? (Reprise) ------
--- Crowd ---
Kira is all the justice
We will ever need
Now it's the criminals
Who tremble, beg, and plead
--- Unknown ---
No lawyers' tricks
Will be of any use to them
Kira is the judge and jury
Who will punish and condemn
--- Unknown ---
Laws are for protecting us
At least, they oughtta be
But instead, they set the bad guys free
--- Unknown ---
Talk about the victims
Fin'ly there's some justice
It's Kira who can give them hope
And change the way things are
--- Light ---
Kira's for the people
The forgotten victims
All the ones the system simply turns away
A little more each day
--- Crowd ---
Kira gives back our justice
Yes, he is our justice
--- L ---
Kira is narcissistic
It's his fatal flaw
He's sure his actions
Somehow supercede the law
--- Unknown ---
His overconfidence
Will help distort his view
I'll out think him 'til I win
If it's the last thing that I do
--- Crowd ---
Kira knows
--- Light ---
I am their justice
--- Crowd ---
Striking blows
--- Light ---
For all the victims
--- Crowd ---
He's our law
Kira is justice
--- L/Light/Crowd ---
What good is law that can't
Punish those who break it?
We deserve some justice
--- L ---
I am the justice
--- Light ---
I am the justice
--- All ---
