------ The Game Begins ------
--- L: Verse 1 ---
Empty your mind of any theories
'Til all the facts are in
Start at the end of all your queries
To learn where things begin
You analyze by working backwards
Effects reveal their cause
For even perfect crimes have perfect flaws
--- Verse 2 ---
The calculus of a solution
While changing, stays the same
The stronger mind of evolution
Determine who wins the game
I poke and prod to find a weakness
Where the bend becomes the break
And make the most of Kira's first mistake
--- Chorus ---
The game begins the same way
I look for patterns on a screen
Connecting bits of data
Until I find out what they mean
The game begins
--- Verse 4 ---
A kilobyte of information
And soon a corner's turned
Anticipate his adaptation (Ha!)
By using all you've learned
Some little thing, some minor detail
Will draw you in, and then
Another one will draw you out again
--- Chorus ---
The game begins the same way
I look for patterns on a screen
Connecting bits of data
Until I find out what they mean
--- Unknown ---
The game begins the same way
The chase is on, the die is cast
I sift a thousand pixels
Until I chase you down at last...
