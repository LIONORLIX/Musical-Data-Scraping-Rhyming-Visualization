------ Secrets and Lies ------
--- L: Verse 1 ---
All of the data has been analyzed
And yet there's something I don't see
The Lind. L Tailor murder televised
Kira killed a man who he thought was really me
What information is eluding me?
With just a name, how can he kill?
What other data does he have to see?
Does he need a face to apply his deadly skill?
--- Soichiro: Verse 2 ---
How can I ever be at ease with L?
His methods lack a moral code
And as for Kira, he can go to hell
Taking L along down this dark and evil road
--- Soichiro, L: Chorus ---
The truth is hard to sort out
Among the secrets and the lies
Familiar faces watch you
But with a perfect stranger's eyes
--- Light: Verse 2 ---
Why give away half of my years to see somebody's name?
I'm smart enough, so it appears, to win this stupid game
I'll rid the world of any criminal who wants to play
And also rid the world of anybody who gets in my way
--- Light, L: Chorus ---
The line is quickly blurring
Between what's right and what is not
I don't care who gets hurt now
As long as I get one more shot
--- Light: Verse 3 ---
Why give away half of my years to see somebody's name?
--- L ---
What information is eluding me?
--- Light ---
I'm smart enough, so it appears, to win this stupid game
--- L ---
What other data does he have to see?
--- Light ---
I'll rid the world of any criminal who wants to play
And also rid the world of anybody who gets in my way
--- L: Chorus ---
The truth is hard to sort out
Among the secrets and the lies
--- Light ---
Familiar faces watch you
But with a perfect stranger's eyes
--- L, Light ---
The line is quickly blurring between what's right and what is not
I don't care who gets hurt now
