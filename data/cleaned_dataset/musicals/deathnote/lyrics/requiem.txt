------ Requiem ------
--- Ensemble ---
Sleep now
Here among your choices
Then drift away
Here now, how the world rejoices
Shades of grey
Gone, who was right or wrong
Who was weak or strong
Nothing left to learn
Feel every gentle breeze
Whisper through the trees
As the seasons turn
Souls sing their oratory
Fading west as they fly (Fading as they fly)
Tales full of fleeting glories
Stories old as the word good
