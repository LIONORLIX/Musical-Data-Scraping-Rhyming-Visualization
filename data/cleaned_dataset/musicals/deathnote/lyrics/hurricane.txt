------ Hurricane ------
--- Light: Verse 1 ---
Did I hear correctly?
Did it really happen?
Was it simply done by writing down his name?
--- Unknown ---
Killing indirectly
Pen and ink and paper
Writing is the gun, I only have to aim
--- Unknown ---
Could this be the hour?
Unimagined power
Waiting to devour who I say?
--- Chorus ---
The hardest rains
The coldest winds
Are waiting for the hurricane
--- Unknown ---
The human stains
And all their sins
Blown away
--- Unknown ---
The earth will shake
The sky will scream
Once they feel the power of the hurricane
--- Verse 2 ---
Finally a chance to
Find a little justice
There's nowhere to run to once the name is penned
--- Unknown ---
Take what fortune grants you
Use it while you've got it
Once you have begun you write it to the end
--- Unknown ---
Elegant solution
Flawless execution
Righteous retribution on the way
--- Chorus ---
I'll bring the rain
I'll bring the wind
I am the mighty hurricane
--- Unknown ---
The human stains
And all their sins
Blown away
--- Unknown ---
I'll bring the pain
So be afraid
I will bring the power of the hurricane
--- Unknown ---
I am the God of a brave new world
Much better than the last
The time for talking is finally in the past
--- Chorus ---
The hardest rains
The coldest winds
Are waiting for the hurricane
--- Unknown ---
The human stains
And all their sins
Blown away
--- Unknown ---
The hardest rains
The coldest winds
Are waiting for the hurricane
--- Unknown ---
The human stains
And all their sins
Blown away
--- Unknown ---
The earth will shake
The sky will scream
