------ I'm Ready ------
--- Misa: Verse 1 ---
Well, they say I'm too young
And they call me a fool
Who can't possibly know my own heart
--- Unknown ---
So they tell me to wait
'Til I'm finished with school
But right now is when love wants to start
--- Unknown ---
And the world may be cold
And the world may be cruel
But this world is all that I've got
--- Unknown ---
So what I'm dreaming of
Is somebody to love
Hope you're ready, 'cause I'm ready
Ready or not
--- Pre-Chorus ---
Because life is too short
And the road is too long
To believe you can walk it alone
--- Unknown ---
But together we might
Find a place to belong
Where together we'll face the unknown
--- Unknown ---
If you're ever afraid
You can just lean on me
And become all the things that you're not
--- Unknown ---
Let me kiss you, and then
Let me kiss you again
If you're ready, 'cause I'm ready
Ready or not
--- Chorus ---
I'm ready! Yes, I'm ready!
And I hope that baby you're ready, too
I'm ready! Yes, I'm ready!
'Cause I feel like I'm falling with you
I'm ready! Yes, I'm ready!
And I hope that baby you're ready, too
I'm ready! Yes, I'm ready!
Baby, ready or not, I'm in love with you
--- Verse2 ---
I don't care where we go
I don't care what we do
I don't care what the world has to say
--- Unknown ---
'Cause the world doesn't know
What I feel about you
And that feeling just grows every day
--- Unknown ---
If it's right or it's wrong
Only love sees you through
And love's really all that we've got
--- Unknown ---
Close your eyes, baby, then
Let me kiss you again
Hope you're ready, 'cause I'm ready
Ready or not
--- Chorus ---
I'm ready! Yes, I'm ready!
And I hope that baby you're ready, too
I'm ready! Yes, I'm ready!
'Cause I feel like I'm falling with you
I'm ready! Yes, I'm ready!
And I hope that baby you're ready, too
I'm ready! Yes, I'm ready!
Baby, ready or not, I'm in love with you
--- Bridge ---
Baby, I can love you, come on over here now
Wait are you ready cuz I'm ready, ready set go boom
Baby you can let me come on over here now
Wait are you ready cuz im ready, ready set go boom
--- Unknown ---
Baby, I can love you, come on over here now
Wait, are you ready cuz I'm ready, ready set go boom
Baby you can let me come on over here now
Wait are you ready cuz I
--- Chorus ---
I'm ready, oh-oh-oh
