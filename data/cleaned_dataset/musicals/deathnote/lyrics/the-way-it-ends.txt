------ The Way It Ends ------
--- L: Verse 1 ---
I'm sitting down and pouring tea as if I do it every day
Go through the motions like the hands upon a clock
Though it feels right a part of me knows that it's wrong
As if another's will had moved me
--- Unknown ---
It's like I'm hitting all my marks, as if I'm acting in a play
So out of character, yet somehow not a shock
I'm like a software program caught in an endless loop
Just bad code that keeps repeating
--- L: Chorus ---
Is this the way it ends now?
How could I not see this coming?
My camera's cloudy lens now
Takes much darker pictures than before
--- Light: Verse 2 ---
I know by now you understand you're but a pawn upon a board
I've won the game but never gave up half my years
Life will continue just the way I've always planned
Let the cold, hard justice crash the system
--- Unknown ---
I've always stayed a step ahead
But you were with me the whole way
Until I played upon a Shinigami's fears
For Misa's love, she wrote your name then left upon a breeze
Into the sands of dust and darkness
--- Light: Chorus ---
This is the way it ends now!
--- L ---
See it flicker, hear it humming
--- Light ---
My power just extends now!
Rem has written, you will write no more!
--- L: Bridge ---
I've seen through you right from the start!
--- Light ---
I've simply let you play your part!
--- L ---
You'll never ever get away!
--- Light ---
Don't you see that you will die today?
--- L: Chorus ---
Is this the way it ends now?
How could I not see this coming?
The message that it sends now
Sounds exactly like a closing door
--- Light ---
This is the way it ends now!
See it blazing, hear it drumming
--- L ---
Like a closing door!
--- Light ---
Feel how a minute spends now
When you wish you had a minute more
--- L ---
Like a closing door
--- Light ---
