------ They're Only Human ------
--- Ryuk ---
Look at how they crawl around
Upon the ground
Like little ants
--- Rem ---
Yes, but how they fascinate
Confusing fate
With what is merely chance
--- Ryuk ---
Isn’t it a laugh?
--- Rem ---
Isn’t it a shame?
--- Ryuk ---
Thinking there is someone in heaven to blame
--- Rem ---
Yes, but even while blaming fate for the lives that they lead
They hope for the lives that they need
--- Ryuk ---
Living every day ‘til the day they die
Never getting answers
--- Rem ---
Yet still asking why
Going through the motions as if there will be a reward
--- Ryuk ---
While we stay eternally bored!
--- Both ---
They’re only human
They don’t see
Who they are is who they’ll always be
Only human, after all
--- Ryuk ---
So they push and they shove
--- Rem ---
With this thing they call love
--- Both ---
‘Til they fall!
--- Ryuk ---
Isn’t it a farce?
--- Rem ---
Isn’t it a waste?
--- Ryuk ---
Struggling to face what can never be faced
--- Rem ---
Yes, but maybe death can release something more than we share
--- Ryuk ---
I really don’t know and don’t care
--- Both ---
They’re only human
Standing still
Doomed to live pushing boulders uphill
Only human, after all
--- Ryuk ---
So they give and they take
--- Rem ---
Hoping someone will help break their fall
--- Ryuk ---
They will pray, curse, live, die
Never knowing their truth is another man’s lie
--- Rem ---
Eat, sleep, love, hate
Like a leaf blowing in the wind
--- Ryuk ---
Watch them all vacillate!
--- Both ---
They’re only human
They can’t see
--- Ryuk ---
All the years they could give you and me
Only human, after all
--- Rem ---
So they give and we take
--- Ryuk ---
‘Til their silly hearts break
--- Rem ---
Looking down from above
I’m intrigued by their love
--- Ryuk ---
So let’s call!
