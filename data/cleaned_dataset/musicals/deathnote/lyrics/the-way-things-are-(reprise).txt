------ The Way Things Are (Reprise) ------
--- L: Verse 1 ---
Finally figured a way to prove
Kira is your name
I win the game
Gotta calculate one last trick
Get you there by ten
The pier, and then
--- Pre-Chorus ---
Into the warehouse where
I'll corner you at last
Bring a gun and end it fast
There is no escaping
--- Chorus ---
The cold, hard truth
Won't disappear
You can't change it
You will face your end
And cringe with fear
You can't escape it
--- Unknown ---
The cold, hard truth
Is my north star
So no matter what you might try
Shake the heavens, shatter the sky
I know that today you will die
