------ I'll Only Love You More ------
--- Misa: Verse 1 ---
You wake me, you take me
Remake me more than anyone
I'll show you, I know you
I owe you, more than anyone
--- Pre-Chorus ---
You rescue me from all my tears
I'd gladly give you half my years
--- Chorus ---
I'd pay any price for finding you
And spend what's left reminding you
My restless life is worth so much more
Because of you worth living for
If I find you maybe love me too
I'll only love you more
--- Verse 2 ---
I'm here now, it's clear now
You're near now, please, please don't run away
I feel you, so will you
Reveal you, don't wanna run away
--- Pre-Chorus ---
I'll read your name and see your face
A kiss away from your embrace
--- Chorus ---
I'd pay any price for finding you
And spend what's left reminding you
My restless life is worth so much more
Because of you worth living for
If I find you maybe love me too
I'll only love you more
--- Bridge ---
My golden temple by the sea
You are my kamakura tree
--- Chorus ---
I'd pay any price for finding you
And spend what's left reminding you
My restless life is worth so much more
Because of you worth living for
If I find you maybe love me too
I'll only love you more
--- Outro ---
I'm hear now, it's clear now
