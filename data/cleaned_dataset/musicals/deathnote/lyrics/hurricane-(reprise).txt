------ Hurricane (Reprise) ------
--- Unknown ---
(As LIGHT talks to HALEY BELLE, a woman's chanting of Kira can be heard for four times as he announces his plan to murder Belle. A clock is ticking in the background.)
--- Light ---
I'll bring the rain
I'll bring the wind
I am the mighty hurricane
--- Unknown ---
The human stains
And all their sins
Blown away
--- Unknown ---
I'll bring the pain
So be afraid
I will bring the power of the hurricane
