------ There Are Lines ------
--- Soichiro: Verse 1 ---
There are lines that can't be crossed
There are thing you shouldn't do
For you pay too high a cost
And you lose a piece of you
--- Unknown ---
You don't justify the means
In the service of an end
Smashing laws to smithereens
Till there aren't any rules left to break or mend
--- Unknown ---
Set a thief to catch a thief
Trap a liar with a lie
But don't traffic in this grief
In the name of eye for eye
--- Unknown ---
Nothing wrong can turn out right
By saying wrong's all right to do
Men of principle must fight
So the truth that's in the man
That you are stays true
--- Chorus ---
You don't kill someone
As a substitute
You don't load a gun
Close your eyes and shoot
You don't kill a man
Just to buy a clue
This is not a plan
Lawmen can pursue
--- Light: Verse 2 ---
Father, you know that I feel as you do
For these lessons I learned at your knee
And I think maybe by working with you
Helping you will be helpful for me
--- Soichiro: Chorus ---
You don't kill someone
--- Light ---
You don't kill someone
--- Soichiro ---
As a substitute!
--- Light ---
As a substitute!
--- Soichiro ---
You don't load a gun
--- Light ---
You don't
--- Soichiro, Light ---
Close your eyes and shoot!
--- Soichiro ---
You don't kill a man just to read the signs
--- Light ---
That's no better than
Bad that good defines
--- Soichiro ---
Never cross these lines
--- Light ---
Never cross these lines
--- Soichiro, Light ---
