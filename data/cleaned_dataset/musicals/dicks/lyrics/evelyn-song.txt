------ Evelyn Song ------
--- Unknown ---
I lead a charmed life, Trevor
Don't you understand?
--- Unknown ---
My life's been quite the wild ride
Intrigue, thrills, romance
I may have reached my twilight years
But it's all still song and dance
--- Unknown ---
Seasons come and seasons go
The years keep flying by
And now I'll sit here in my house until the day I die
--- Unknown ---
I'm an independent woman
I do what I want when I want with whom I want
I am very confused
I'm afraid you simply don't understand
What a gift it is when you get to be my age
--- Unknown ---
I'm ninety-three, no, ninety-four
That can't be right
Just wait, there's more
My back is broke, my tits they sag
I have to pee into a bag
I have three toes, my eyes are coined
A mouse named Pip lives in loins
I smell like milk, way more like cheese
My nipples wink, I never sneeze
--- Unknown ---
I cannot remember the year I was born
I taught all my friends how to play
I've seen every movie and most of them thrice
For breakfast I only eat hay
--- Unknown ---
I don't wear shoes, I can't tell time
I speak in tongues, I like old limes
I sing to frogs, collect the rain
I have spaghetti in my brain
Well, this has been fun, but I gotta be anywhere but here
Woah
I keep all my ice cubes inside of my purse
I have a whole room full of teeth
I only read backwards, I never use spoons
My mother is also my niece
--- Unknown ---
My organs are cotton, I cry melted better
I have no reflection, I bathe in his vessels
The world is a riddle, I might be the Devil
I heard he fell off like the breeze
Hey
--- Unknown ---
Who saw that coming?
