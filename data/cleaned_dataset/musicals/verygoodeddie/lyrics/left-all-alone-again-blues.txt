------ Left All Alone Again Blues ------
--- Unknown ---
I have the blues,
Ev'ry time my hubby leaves me I have the blues
Because it peeves me to be left here flat here
Just like a bump on a log.
I said on a log.
No woman knows if she has a travelin' husband
Just where he goes
Unless she follows on and nails him, trails him
Just like a faithful old dog.
That old song Where has my highland laddie gone?
It says a mouthful
We never do know just where they do go
How they keep us guessin', isn't it distressin'!
I have the blues when my hubby leaves,
Although I wouldn't accuse
Each time he says Good-bye
I get those same old left all alone again blues.
--- Unknown ---
I have the blues,
Ever since he married me, I sure have the blues
Because I used to have a good time, each time,
Every time I might roam, I said when I'd roam.
When first we met, we could render a duet
But now hubby sings I won't be home 'til morning,
Never one short stanza of Home Sweet Home.
I like cats, I'm fond of rabbits
I like dogs and even goldfish
It's lucky maybe for there's a baby
Grand piano comin', then I'll start hummin':
I have the blues only hubby dear can cure my terrible blues
Each time he says Good-bye
I get those doggone left all alone again blues.

Chorus

Oh, where, and oh, where is your highland laddie gone?
Oh, where, and oh, where is your highland laddie gone?
He's gone with streaming banners where noble deeds are done;
