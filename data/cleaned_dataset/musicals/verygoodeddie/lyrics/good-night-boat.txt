------ Good Night Boat ------
--- Unknown ---
When the gentle breeze is blowing across the summer sea
Take a little trip on my little ship.
Is she safe and easy going?
We want a guarantee
Safe as any Ford - right face all aboard!

Good night boat the pretty greenery and scenery you view
Good night boat
And when the river shivers you will shiver too.
And when the good old jug band starts a beatin' it,
You can't help but get your feet in it,
Slip slide with the tide
Cling close Hudson glide!
Good night boat
Then you'll be hailing every sail and every buoy
Oo - oo - oo - oo! Ship ahoy!
You're just as safe as you'd be on land
For she's the sturdiest craft afloat!
