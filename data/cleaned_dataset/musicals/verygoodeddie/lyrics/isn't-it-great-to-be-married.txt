------ Isn't It Great to Be Married ------
--- Georgina and Eddie Kettle, Elsie and Percy Darling ---
This world's all right when someone loves you.
--- Georgina and Eddie ---
'Tis our delight to do as doves do.
--- Percy and Elsie Darling ---
From morn till night we'll coo as doves coo.
--- Georgin and Eddie ---
Pidgy-woo!
--- Percy ---
Pidgy-woo!
--- All ---
Pidgy-woo.
Isn't it great to be happily married to the one you love!
Heigh-ho!
Isn't it great to be somebody's poopsy-woopsy - turtle dove!
Heigh-ho!
Poets may write of their heavenly night
And of their stars and moonlight sea
But living alone, in a home of our own
Is heaven enough for me.
--- Elsie Darling ---
What proof have we of your affection?
--- Percy and Eddie ---
What can we do in that direction?
--- Georgina ---
Give us the vote in next election
--- Percy ---

--- Georgina ---
He'll agree.
--- Eddie ---
I agree]

Isn't it great to be happily married to the one you love!
--- Eddie ---
Heigh-ho!
--- All ---
Isn't it great to be somebody's poopsy-woopsy - turtle dove!
--- Georgina Kettle and Elsie Darling ---
Heigh-ho!
--- All ---
Poets may write of their heavenly night
And of their stars and moonlight sea,
But living alone, in a home of our own
