------ We're On Our Way ------
--- Steward ---
Poughkeepsie! This landing is Poughkeepsie.
The Hudson River Day Line is here for 15 minutes only.
See the steward about renting megaphones for the big boat race.
--- Chorus ---
The simple life for us
We've come aboard this bus
To swap a pitiful city
Full of fashion and fuss.
For that little town
Of fairy tale renown,
That Mr. Rip chose to choose
For his twenty-year snooze!
--- Unknown ---
Every time that whistle blows today,
It seems as though it tries to say
Oh, fair Manhattan isle
Silk-an'-satin-isle,
Good-bye, we're on our way.
--- Unknown ---
No more large nights for me
Absorbing cocktails and cherries
At Maxim's and Sherry's.
No more high flights for me,
My dates are cancelled and called off
--- Unknown ---
At Del's and the Waldorf
Good-bye, Fifth Avenue,
Broadway, I've news for you
They're going to lock you up,
So they say.
Oh, what a chance,
While we're away,
------ fin ------
