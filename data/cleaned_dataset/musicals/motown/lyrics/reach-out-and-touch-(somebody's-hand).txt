------ Reach Out and Touch (Somebody's Hand) ------
--- Unknown ---
Reach out and touch
Somebody's hand
Make this world a better place
If you can
Reach out and touch
Somebody's hand
Make this world a better place
If you can
--- Unknown ---
(Just try)
Take a little time out of your busy day
To give encouragement
To someone who's lost the way
Or would I be talking to a stone
If I asked you
To share a problem that's not your own
We can change things if we start giving
Why don't you
--- Unknown ---
Reach out and touch
Somebody's hand
Make this world a better place
If you can
Reach out and touch
Somebody's hand
Make this world a better place
If you can
--- Unknown ---
(Just try)
If you see an old friend on the street
And he's down
Remember his shoes could fit your feet
Try a little kindness you'll see
It's something that comes very naturally
We can change things if we start giving
--- Unknown ---
Why don't you
Reach out and touch
Why don't you (Why don't you)
Reach out and touch somebody's hand
--- Unknown ---
Reach out and touch
Somebody's hand
Make this world a better place
If you can
Reach out and touch
Somebody's hand
Make this world a better place
