------ Do You Love Me ------
--- Unknown ---
You broke my heart
'Cause I couldn't dance
You didn't even want me around
And now I'm back
To let you know
I can really shake 'em down
--- Unknown ---
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Ah, do you love?
Now that I can dance
--- Unknown ---
Watch me now, oh
Ah, work it all baby
Well, you're drivin' me crazy
With a little bit of soul now
--- Unknown ---
I can mash-potatoe
And I can do the twist
Now tell me baby
Mmm, do you like it like this
Tell me
Tell me
--- Unknown ---
Do you love me?
Now, do you love me?
Now, do you love me?
Now that I can dance
Dance
--- Unknown ---
Watch me now, oh
Ah, shake it up, shake it
Ah, shake 'em, shake 'em down
Ah, little bit of soul now
--- Unknown ---
(Work, work)
Ah, shake it, shake it baby
Ah, you're driving me crazy
Ah, don't get lazy
--- Unknown ---
I can mash-potatoe
And I can do the twist
Well now tell me baby
Mmm, do you like it like this
Tell me
Tell me
--- Unknown ---
Do you love me?
Now, do you love me?
Now, do you love me?
--- Unknown ---
(Work, work)
Ah, I'm working hard baby
Well, you're driving me crazy
And don't you get lazy
--- Unknown ---
(Work, work)
Ah, hey hey baby
Well, you're driving me crazy
And don't you get lazy
