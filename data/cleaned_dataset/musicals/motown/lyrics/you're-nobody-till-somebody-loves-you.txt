------ You're Nobody till Somebody Loves You ------
--- Unknown ---
You're nobody till somebody loves you
You're nobody till somebody cares
--- Unknown ---
You may be king, you may posses the world and it's gold
Gold won't bring you happiness when you're growing old
--- Unknown ---
The world isn't the same, you'll never change it
As sure as the sun shines above you
--- Unknown ---
You're nobody till somebody loves you
So find yourself somebody to love
--- Unknown ---
You're nobody till somebody loves you
You're nobody till somebody cares

You may be king, you may posses the world and it's gold
But gold won't bring you happiness when you're growing old

The world isn't the same, you'll never change it
As sure as the sun shines above you
--- Unknown ---
You're nobody till somebody loves you
So find yourself somebody
You don't need just anybody
