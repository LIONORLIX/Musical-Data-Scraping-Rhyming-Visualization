------ Love Is Here and Now You're Gone ------
--- Unknown ---
Love is here and
Oh, my darling, now you're gone
Love is here and
Oh, my darling, now, now you're gone
--- Unknown ---
You persuaded me to love you
And I did
But instead of tenderness
I found heartache instead
Into your arms I fell
So unaware of the loneliness
That was waiting there
--- Unknown ---
You close the door to your heart
And you turned the key
Locked your love away from me
--- Unknown ---
Love is here and
Oh, my darling, now you're gone
You made me love you
And oh, my darling, now you're gone
--- Unknown ---
You said loving you would make life beautiful
With each passing day
But as soon as love came into my heart
You turned and you walked, just walked away
--- Unknown ---
You stripped me of my dreams
You gave me faith, then took my hope
Look at me now
--- Unknown ---
Look at me
See what loving you has done to me
Look at my face
See how cryin' has left it's trace
--- Unknown ---
After you made me all your own
Then you left me all alone
You made your words sound so sweet
Knowing that your love I couldn't keep
--- Unknown ---
My heart cries out for your touch
But you're not there
And the lonely cry fades in the air
--- Unknown ---
Love is here and
Oh, my darling, now you're gone
Love is here and
Oh, my darling, now you're gone
--- Unknown ---
You made me love you
Oh, my darling, now you're gone
You made me love you
Oh, my darling, now you're gone
