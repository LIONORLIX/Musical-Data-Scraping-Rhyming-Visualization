Sugarpie honeybunch
You know that I love you
I can't help myself
I love you and nobody else
In and out my life
You come and you go
Leaving just your picture behind
And I kissed it a thousand times
--- Unknown ---
When you snap your fingers
Or wink your eye
I come a running to you
I'm tied to you, baby
And there's nothing I can do
Ooh, sugar
--- Unknown ---
Sugarpie honeybunch
I'm weaker than a man should be
I can't help myself
I'm a fool in love you see
Wanna tell you I don't love you
Tell you that we're through
And I've tried
But everytime I see your face
I get up all choked up inside
--- Unknown ---
When I call your name, girl
It starts the flame burning in my heart
Tearin' it all apart
No matter how I try
My love I cannot hide
--- Unknown ---
Sugarpie honeybunch
You now that I'm weak for you
I can't help myself
I love you and nobody else
--- Unknown ---
Sugarpie honeybunch
I'll do anything you ask me to
I can't help myself
I want you and nobody else
--- Unknown ---
Sugarpie honeybunch
You know that I love you
