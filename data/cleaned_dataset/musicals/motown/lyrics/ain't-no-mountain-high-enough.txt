------ Ain't No Mountain High Enough ------
--- Unknown ---
Listen, baby
Ain't no mountain high
Ain't no valley low
Ain't no river wide enough, baby
--- Unknown ---
If you need me, call me
No matter where you are
No matter how far
Don't worry, baby
Just call my name
I'll be there in a hurry
You don't have to worry
--- Unknown ---
'Cause baby,
There ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough
Ain't no river wide enough
To keep me from getting to you
--- Unknown ---
Remember the day
I set you free
I told you
You could always count on me
From that day on I made a vow
I'll be there if you want me
Some way, some how
--- Unknown ---
'Cause baby,
There ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough
Ain't no river wide enough
To keep me from getting to you, baby
--- Unknown ---
Oh no, darling
No wind, no rain
No winter storm can stop me baby
--- Unknown ---
No, no baby
If you were ever in trouble
I'll be there on the double
Just stay for me, oh baby
--- Unknown ---
My love is alive
Way down in my heart
Although we are miles apart
If you ever need a helping hand
I'll be there on the double
Just as fast as I can
--- Unknown ---
Baby
There ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough
Ain't no river wide enough
To keep me from getting to you, baby
--- Unknown ---
Don't you know that
There ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough
Ain't no river wide enough
Ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough
Ain't no river wide enough
Ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough...
