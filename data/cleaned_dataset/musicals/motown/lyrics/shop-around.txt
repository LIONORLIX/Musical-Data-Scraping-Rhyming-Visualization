When I became of age my mother called me to her side,
She said,Son, you're growing up now pretty soon you'll take a bride.
And then she said, Just because you've become a young man now,
There's still somethings that you don't understand now,
Before you ask some girl for her hand now
Keep your freedom for as long as you can now.

My mama told me, "You better shop around, (shop, shop)
Oh yeah, you better shop around. (shop, shop around)

Aha, got some things that I want you to know now.
Just as sure as the winds gonna blow now
The women come and the women gonna go now
Before you tell em that you love em so now.

My mama told me, "You better shop around, (shop, shop)
Oh yeah, you better shop around. (shop, shop around)
