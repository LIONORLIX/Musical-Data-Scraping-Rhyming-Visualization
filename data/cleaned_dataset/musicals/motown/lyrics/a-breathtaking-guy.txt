------ A Breathtaking Guy ------
--- Unknown ---
One night you held me tight
And whispered in my ear
All night sweet words
I never heard
And I believed every word
--- Unknown ---
Next day you came my way
Without a word to say you passed me by
You didn't bat an eye
My darling won't you tell me why
You're acting strange toward me
Why have you changed toward me
--- Unknown ---
Are you just a breathtaking
First sight soul-shaking
One night love-making
Next day heartbreaking guy
--- Unknown ---
That night your love was true
The next day we were through
Your love was gone
And you were moving on
And I was left to cry alone
What have I done to you
Was it just fun to you
--- Unknown ---
Are you just a breathtaking
First sight soul-shaking
One night love-making
Next day heartbreaking guy
--- Unknown ---
Breathtaking, soulshaking,
Lovemaking, heartbreaking guy
Breathtaking, soulshaking,
