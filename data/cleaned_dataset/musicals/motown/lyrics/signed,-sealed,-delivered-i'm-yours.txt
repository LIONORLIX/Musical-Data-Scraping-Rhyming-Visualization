------ Signed, Sealed, Delivered I'm Yours ------
--- Unknown ---
Like a fool I went and stayed too long
Now I'm wondering if your love's still strong
Oo, baby, here I am, signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours!
--- Unknown ---
Then that time I went and said goodbye
Now I'm back and not ashamed to cry
Oo, baby, here I am, signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours!
--- Unknown ---
Here I am baby
Signed, Sealed, Delivered, I'm yours
Here I am baby
Signed, Sealed, Delivered, I'm yours
--- Unknown ---
I've done a lot of foolish things
That I really didn't mean, didn't I?
--- Unknown ---
Seen a lot of things in this old world
When I touch them, they mean nothing, girl
Oo, baby, here I am, signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours!
--- Unknown ---
Oowee baby, you set my soul on fire
That's why I know you're my heart's only desire
--- Unknown ---
Here I am baby
Signed, Sealed, Delivered, I'm yours
Here I am baby
Signed, Sealed, Delivered, I'm yours
