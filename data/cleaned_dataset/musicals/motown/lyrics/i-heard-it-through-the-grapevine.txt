------ I Heard It Through the Grapevine ------
--- Unknown ---
Ooh, I bet you're wondering how I knew
About you plans to make me blue
With some other guy that you knew before.
Between the two of us guys
You know I love you more.
It took me by surprise I must say,
When I found out yesterday.
Don't you know that...
--- Unknown ---
(Chorus:)
I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine.
Oh I heard it through the grapevine,
Oh and I'm just about to lose my mind.
Honey, honey yeah.
--- Unknown ---
I know that a man ain't supposed to cry,
But these tears I can't hold inside.
Losin' you would end my life you see,
'Cause you mean that much to me.
You could have told me yourself
That you love someone else.
Instead...
--- Unknown ---
(Chorus)
--- Unknown ---
People say believe half of what you see,
Son, and none of what you hear.
I can't help bein' confused
If it's true please tell me dear?
Do you plan to let me go
For the other guy you loved before?
Don't you know...
--- Unknown ---
(Chorus)
--- Unknown ---
Honey Honey I know
That you're letting me go
said, I heard it through the grapvine
