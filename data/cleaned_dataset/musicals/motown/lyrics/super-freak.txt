She's a very kinky girl
The kind you don't take home to mother
She will never let your spirits down
Once you get her off the street, ow girl

She likes the boys in the band
She says that I'm her all-time favorite
When I make my move to her room
It's the right time
She's never hard to please

The kind of girl you read about
That girl is pretty kinky

From her head down to her toenails
And she'll wait for me at backstage
With her girlfriends
In a limousine

Room 714, I'll be waiting
When I get there she's got incense
Wine and candles
It's such a freaky scene
