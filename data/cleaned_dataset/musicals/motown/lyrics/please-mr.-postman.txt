Mr. Postman, look and see
If there's a letter in your bag for me
I've been waiting a long long time
Since I heard from that gal of mine
--- Unknown ---
There must be some word someday
From my girlfriend so far away
Please Mr. Postman look and see
If there's a letter, a letter for me
--- Unknown ---
I've been standing here waiting Mr. Postman
So-o-o patiently
For just a card or just a letter
Saying she's returning home to me
Please Mr. Postman

Mr. Postman, look and see
If there's a letter in your bag for me
I've been waiting a long long time
Since I heard from that gal of mine

So many days you passed me by
Trail of tears standing in my eye
You didn't stop to make me feel better
By leaving me a card or a letter
Mr. Postman

Wait a minute, wait a minute, oh yeah
You gotta wait a minute, wait a minute, oh yeah
Check it and see, one more time for me

You gotta wait a minute, wait a minute, oh yeah
Wait a minute, wait a minute, oh yeah

You gotta wait a minute, wait a minute, oh yeah
Wait a minute, wait a minute, oh yeah
You gotta wait a minute, wait a minute, oh yeah
