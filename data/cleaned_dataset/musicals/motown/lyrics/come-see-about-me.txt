------ Come See About Me ------
--- Unknown ---
I've been crying (ooh, ooh)
'Cause I'm lonely (for you)
Smiles have all turned (to tears)
But tears won't wash away the fears
--- Unknown ---
That you're never ever gonna return
To ease the fire that within me burns
It keeps me crying baby for you
Keeps me sighin' baby for you
--- Unknown ---
So won't you hurry
Come on boy, see about me
See about you baby
--- Unknown ---
I've given up my friends just for you
My friends are gone and you have too
No peace shall I find
Until you come back and be mine
--- Unknown ---
No matter what you do or say
I'm gonna love you anyway
Keep on crying baby for you
I'm gonna keep sighin' baby for you
--- Unknown ---
So come on hurry
Come on and see about me
See about you baby
--- Unknown ---
Sometime's up (ooh, ooh)
Sometime's down (ooh, ooh)
My life's so uncertain (ooh, ooh)
With you not around (ooh, ooh)
--- Unknown ---
From my arms you maybe out of reach
But my heart says you're here to keep
Keeps me crying baby for you
Keep on, keep on crying baby for you
--- Unknown ---
So won't you hurry
Come on boy, see about me
See about you baby
--- Unknown ---
You know I'm so lonely
I love you only
--- Unknown ---
See about your baby
Hurry, hurry
