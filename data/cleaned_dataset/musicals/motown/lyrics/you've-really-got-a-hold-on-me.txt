------ You've Really Got a Hold on Me ------
--- Unknown ---
I don't like you, but I love you
Seems that I'm always thinkin' of you
You treat me badly, I love you madly
You've really got a hold on me
You really got a hold on me
--- Unknown ---
Baby, I don't want you, but I need you
Don't wanna kiss you, but I need to
You do me wrong now, my love is strong now
You've really got a hold on me
You really got a hold on me
--- Unknown ---
Baby, I love you and all I want you to do
Is just hold me, hold me, hold me, hole me
Tighter, tighter
--- Unknown ---
I wanna leave you, don't wanna stay here
Don't wanna spend another day here
I wanna split now, I can't quit now
