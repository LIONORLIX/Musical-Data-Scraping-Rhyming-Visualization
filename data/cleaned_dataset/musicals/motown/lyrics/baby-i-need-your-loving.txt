------ Baby I Need Your Loving ------
--- Unknown ---
Baby I need your lovin', baby I need your lovin'
Although you're never near, your voice I often hear
Another day, another night, I long to hold you tight
'Cause I'm so lonely
--- Unknown ---
Baby, I need your lovin'
I got to have all your lovin'
Baby, I need your lovin'
Got to have all your lovin'
--- Unknown ---
Some say it's a sign of weakness for a man to beg
Then weak I'd rather be
If it means havin' you to keep
'Cause lately I've been losin' sleep
--- Unknown ---
Baby, I need your lovin'
I got to have all your lovin'
Baby, I need your lovin'
Got to have all your lovin'
--- Unknown ---
Empty nights echo your name
Oh sometimes I wonder will I ever be the same
--- Unknown ---
Oh yeah, when you see me smile you know, things have gotten worse
Any smile you might see has all been rehearsed
Darlin' I can't go on without you, this emptiness won't let me live without you
This loneliness inside me darlin' makes me feel half alive
--- Unknown ---
Baby, I need your lovin'
I got to have all your lovin'
Baby, I need your lovin'
Got to have all your lovin'
--- Unknown ---
Baby, I need your lovin'
