------ My Girl ------
--- Unknown ---
I've got sunshine on a cloudy day
When it's cold outside I've got the month of May
I guess you'd say
What can make me feel this way?
My girl (my girl, my girl)
Talkin' 'bout my girl (my girl)
--- Unknown ---
I've got so much honey the bees envy me
I've got a sweeter song than the birds in the trees
I guess you'd say
What can make me feel this way?
My girl (my girl, my girl)
Talkin' 'bout my girl (my girl)
--- Unknown ---
Hey hey hey
Hey hey hey
Ooh
--- Unknown ---
I don't need no money, fortune, or fame
I've got all the riches baby one man can claim
I guess you'd say
What can make me feel this way?
My girl (my girl, my girl)
Talkin' 'bout my girl (my girl)
--- Unknown ---
I've got sunshine on a cloudy day
With my girl
--- Unknown ---
I've even got the month of May
