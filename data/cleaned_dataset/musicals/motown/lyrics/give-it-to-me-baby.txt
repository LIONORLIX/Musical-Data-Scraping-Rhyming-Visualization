When I came home last night
You wouldn't make love to me
You went fast asleep
YOu wouldn't even talk to me
said I'm so crazy
Coming home intoxicated
I said I just wanna love ya
Guess that's why I'm so elated (C'mon girl)

Give it to me baby (give to me baby)
Give it to me baby (give to me baby)
Make it hot like you've had enough
Give it to me baby (give it to me baby)
Just give it to me baby
Give it to me baby (give it to me baby)
I'll make you hot like you had enough

When I was high as the sky
Out all night just dancing
You say let's go home (c'mon, I'm tired let's go home)
That's the time I start romancin'
You say how can I love ya?
When your body keeps on moving
I say Wait til I sqeeze you (oh)
Maybe then you'll start to groovin'
