------ Where Did Our Love Go ------
--- Unknown ---
Baby, baby
Baby don't leave me
Ooh, please don't leave me
All by myself
--- Unknown ---
I've got this burning, burning
Yearning feelin' inside me
Ooh, deep inside me
And it hurts so bad
--- Unknown ---
You came into my heart
So tenderly
With a burning love
That stings like a bee
--- Unknown ---
Now that I surrender
So helplessly
You now wanna leave
Ooh, you wanna leave me
--- Unknown ---
Ooh, baby, baby
Where did our love go?
Ooh, don't you want me
Don't you want me no more
Ooh, baby
--- Unknown ---
Baby, baby
Where did our love go
And all your promisses
Of a love forever more
--- Unknown ---
I've got this burning, burning
Yearning feelin' inside me
Ooh, deep inside me
And it hurts so bad
--- Unknown ---
Before you won my heart
You were a perfect guy
But now that you got me
You wanna leave me behind
(Baby, baby) ooh baby
--- Unknown ---
Baby, baby don't leave me
Ooh, please don't leave me
All by myself
--- Unknown ---
Ooh, baby, baby
