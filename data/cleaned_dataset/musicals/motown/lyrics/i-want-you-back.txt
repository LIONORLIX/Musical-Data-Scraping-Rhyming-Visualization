------ I Want You Back ------
--- Unknown ---
Uh-huh huh huhhh
Let me tell ya now
Uh-huh
--- Unknown ---
When I had you to myself, I didn't want you around
Those pretty faces always made you stand out in a crowd
But someone picked you from the bunch, one glance was all it took
Now it's much too late for me to take a second look
--- Unknown ---
Oh baby, give me one more chance
Won't you please let me back in your heart
Oh darlin', I was blind to let you go
But now since I see you in his arms
Yes I do now
Ooh ooh baby
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Na na na na
--- Unknown ---
Trying to live without your love is one long sleepless night
Let me show you, girl, that I know wrong from right
Every street you walk on, I leave tear stains on the ground
Following the girl I didn't even want around
--- Unknown ---
Let me tell ya now
Oh baby, all I need is one more chance
Won't you please let me back in your heart
Oh darlin', I was blind to let you go
But now since I see you in his arms
--- Unknown ---
All I want...
All I need...
All I want!
All I need!
--- Unknown ---
Oh, just one more chance
To show you that I love you
Baby baby baby baby baby baby!
Forget what happened then
And let me live again!
--- Unknown ---
Oh baby, I was blind to let you go
But now since I see you in his arms
Spare me of this cause
Give me back what I lost!
--- Unknown ---
Oh baby, I need one more chance, hah
I tell you that I love you
Baby, oh! Baby, oh! Baby, oh!
I want you back!
I want you back!
[Fade out]
