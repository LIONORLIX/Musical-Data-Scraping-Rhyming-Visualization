When your in arms, darling
When your in my arms
Oohhh

That feeling, feeling
Got me rockin' and a reelin'
Oh, I'm crazy 'bout your love buttercup
Your kind of love, can't get enough
--- Unknown ---
You shake me, break me
Every time your lips meet mine
I feel a pounding, pounding
Ohh I can't stand it, stand it
--- Unknown ---
When you lock me in, your embrace
And breathlessly, you kiss my face
I get a strange sensation
Ohh I can't stand it, stand it

Ohhh, I get a feeling, feeling
Got me rockin' and a reelin'
Oh, I'm crazy 'bout your love buttercup
Your kind of love, can't get enough

You take control,
Of my very soul,
Every time your close to me
You make me quiver and shake
Ohh I can't stand it, stand it

I touch your lips, your fingertips
I get a loving reaction, soul satisfaction
Darling, you know that
I can't stand it, stand it
--- Unknown ---
Feeling, feeling
And it's got me rockin' and a reelin'
Oh, I'm crazy 'bout your love buttercup
Your kind of love, can't get enough

You're earthquakin', soul shakin'
Ever lovin', breath takin'
You're electrifying, ohhh
Soul satisfying

When you walk, in a room
Right away I start to swoon
I'm not sure of what you got,
But what it is, I like alot

Ohhh, I get a feeling, feeling
Got me rockin' and a reelin'
Oh, I'm crazy 'bout your love buttercup
Your kind of love, can't get enough

Shake me, break me
Every time your lips meet mine
I feel a pounding, pounding
Ohh I can't stand it, stand it
--- Unknown ---
Ohhh, I get a feeling, feeling
Got me rockin' and a reelin'
Ohhh, I'm crazy 'bout your love buttercup
