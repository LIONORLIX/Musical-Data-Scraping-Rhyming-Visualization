------ She Was There ------
--- Unknown ---
So many nights I have stood in the moonlight
Watching it fade with the dawn
Wanting her back with me, warm in the moonlight
Knowing that moment was gone
Out of mind, out of sight,
Till the moon rose ronight
All at once, I felt a chill
In a spill of moonlight, she was there
Though we both held very still
There was something pulling in the air
When she whispered through the dark
I tried hard to hold my ground
I believed I had a choice
Till the music in her voice
Turned my whole world around
I would like to understand
But the stars and I begin to blur
If she never touched my hand
Then what filled me with the feel of her?
In between us stood a wall
In a flash it fell apart
Is it possible she heard
Every last unspoken word
Racing out of my heart?
She never turned to me, but suddenly
We had so much to share!
I never took her in my arms, but she was there
Oh, she was there!
No, I never pulled her in
Still her tenderness was everywhere
Oh, she slipped beneath my skin
Just as if she'd always been right there
Has she been there all along?
Was I too far gone to know?
What a fool I must have been
For how could I pull her in
