------ They Seek Him Here ------
--- Unknown ---
They seek him here, they seek him there
Those Frenchies seek him everywhere
Is he in heaven or is he in hell?
That demned elusive Pimpernel
He meddles with the Frenchie Revolution
Popping in and out each week
Spoiling every lovely execution
La, what cheek!
They seek him here, they seek him there
Those Frenchies seek him everywhere
If you should see him, please do give a yell!
That demned elusive Pimpernel
They seek him here, they seek him there
Those Frenchies seek him everywhere
Oh, Pimpy, how the Frenchies do implore you
Simply to stay home in bed
With all your interference
It's a chore to chop a head!
They seek him here, they seek him there
The ladies seek him everywhere!
He give the Frenchies nothing but frustration
Sink me! He's a spoilsport
Each and every demned decapitation
He cuts short
They seek him here, they seek him there
Those Frenchies seek him everywhere
Is he in heaven or is he in hell?
