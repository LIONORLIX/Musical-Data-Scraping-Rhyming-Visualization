------ Into The Fire ------
--- Unknown ---
David walked into the valley
With a stone clutched in his hand
He was only a boy
But he knew someone must take a stand
--- Unknown ---
There will always be a valley
Always mountains one must scale
There will always be perilous waters
Which someone must sail
--- Unknown ---
Into valleys, into waters
Into jungles, into hell
Let us ride, let us ride home again with a story to tell
Into darkness, into danger
Into storms that rip the night
Don't give in, but give up
But give thanks for the glorious fight
--- Unknown ---
You can tremble, you can fear it
But keep your fighting spirit alive boys
Let the shiver of it sting you
Fling into battle, spring to your feet boys
Never hold back your step for a moment
Never doubt that your courage will grow
Hold your head even higher and into the fire we go
--- Unknown ---
Are there mountains that surround us?
Are there walls that block the way?
Knock 'em down, strip 'em back boys
And forward and into the fray
--- Unknown ---
Into terror, into valour
Charge ahead, no, never turn
Yes, it's into the fire we fly
And the devil will burn
--- Unknown ---
Someone has to face the valley
Rush in, we have to rally and win boys
When the world is saying not to
By God, you know you've got to march on, boys
Never hold back your step for a moment
Never doubt that your courage will grow
Hold your head ever higher and into the fire we go
--- Unknown ---
Let the lightning strike
Let the flash of it shock you
Choke your fears away
Pull as tight as a wire
Let the fever strike
Let the force of it rock you
We will have our day, sailing into the fire
--- Unknown ---
Someone has to face the valley
Rush in! We have to rally and win boys
When the world is saying not to
By God, you know you've got to march on, boys
Never hold back your step for a moment
Look alive! Oh, your courage will grow
Yes, it's higher and higher and into the fire we go
Into fire!
