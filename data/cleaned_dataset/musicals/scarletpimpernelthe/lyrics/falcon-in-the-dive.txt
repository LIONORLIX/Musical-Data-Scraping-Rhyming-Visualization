------ Falcon In The Dive ------
--- Unknown ---
Hunt for the man
Comb the city, every street, every grate
You put a guard at every gate
Drag him out, shout the moment that you find him!
Daam!
Knock in the doors, lock up the city
Track him down through this town
And be quick about it...now!
How the devil do I ever prevail when I'm only a man?
But I'll never be duped by this scurrilous phantom again
I wasn't born to walk on water
I wasn't born to sack and slaughter
But on my soul, I wasn't born
To stoop, to scorn, and knuckle under
A man can learn to steal some thunder
A man can learn to work some wonder
And when the guantlet's down,
It's time to rise and climb the sky
And soon the moon will smoulder
And the winds will drive
Yes, a man grows older but his soul remains alive
All those tremulous stars still glitter
And I will survive!
Let my heart grow colder and as bitter as a falcon in the dive
There was a dream, a dying ember
There was a dream, I don't remember
But I will resurrect that dream
Though rivers stream and hills grow steeper
For here in hell where life gets cheaper
Oh, here in hell the blood runs deeper
And when the final duel is near
I'll lift my spear and fly
Piercing into the sky and higher
And the strong will thrive
Yes, the weak will cower while the fittest will survive
If we wait for the darkest hour
Till we spring alive
Then with claws of fire, we devour like a falcon in the dive
These are the days! Yes!
Days of glory, days of rage, and the dream
And the dream of Paris preys on my bones
Gnawing night and day and clawing through my brain and
No, never bend! Never kneel!
Rend him to bits! Bite!
Now, the beauty of the fight
I'm not a man to hunger for blood, but the spirit can cry
To be younger and fiercer and fly
Piercing into the sky and higher
And the strong will thrive
Yes, the weak will cower while the fittest will survive
If we wait for the darkest hour
Till we spring alive
