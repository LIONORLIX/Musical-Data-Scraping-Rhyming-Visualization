------ Mammy ------
--- Unknown ---
Everything seems lovely
When you start to roam
But here's what you'll be sayin'
When you are far from home
--- Unknown ---
Mammy, mammy
The sun shines east, the sun shines west
I know where the sun shines best
Oh, my mammy, my mammy
--- Unknown ---
My heart strings a tangle around, Alabama-ammy
--- Unknown ---
I'm comin', sorry that I made you wait
I'm ma ma comin', I hope and pray I'm not too late
--- Unknown ---
Oh my, mammy, my little mammy
I'd walk a million miles, for one of those smiles from mammy
--- Unknown ---
Mammy, yeah, mammy
Woah, woah, the sun shines east, the sun shines west
But I know where the sun shines best
Oh mammy, my little mammy
--- Unknown ---
I'd walk a million miles for one of those smiles
