------ I Would Never Leave You ------
--- Unknown ---
People that I pass often ask me, "How you been?"
How about this weather? Oh my God, you're looking thin!
Though I am flattered
By complimentary chatter,
We hardly get much farther than Hello.
--- Unknown ---
I'll always tell you
The things that really matter,
The only thing you really need to know.
--- Unknown ---
So,
Why do you ask,
Where have I been
So long?
--- Unknown ---
I've been right here,
Living my life
In song.
--- Unknown ---
I've been around,
I've been lost, I've been found,
But I've never really been gone.
I've had romances,
Put my heart out, took my chances -
I learned when it's time to move on.
--- Unknown ---
Oh, but I never left,
Though I've been left alone.
With every breath,
I'm stronger on my own.

The smoke has cleared,
And look who's here:
The same dame you've always known.
--- Unknown ---
Oh, I never left,
And I would never leave you alone.

Oh, but if I have learned
One thing in life that's true.
You're there for me,
And I am here for you.
--- Unknown ---
The smoke has cleared,
And look who's here:
The same damn dame you've always known.
--- Unknown ---
Oh, I never left,
And I would never leave you.
Where would I go?
Don't you know how much I need you?
--- Unknown ---
I never left,
