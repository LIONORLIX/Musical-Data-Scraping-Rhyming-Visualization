------ New York, New York ------
--- Unknown ---
Start spreading the news, i'm leaving today
I want to be a part of it - New York, New York
These vagabond shoes are longing to stray
And step a round of heart of it - New York, New York
--- Unknown ---
I want to wake up in that city, that doesn't sleep,
To find i'm king of the hill - top of the heap
--- Unknown ---
My little town blues, are melting away
I'll make a brand new start of it - in old New York
If i can make it there, i'll make it anywhere
It's up to you - New York, New York
--- Unknown ---
New York, New York
I want to wake up, in that city that doesn't sleep,
To find i'm a number 1, top of the list
King of the hill, a number 1
My little town blues are melting away
I'm gonna make a brand new start of it, in old new york
And- if i can make it there, i'm gonna make it anywhere
