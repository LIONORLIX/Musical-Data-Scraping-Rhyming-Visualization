It's Liza with a Z
Not Lisa with an S
'Cause Lisa with an S
Goes sss not zzz
It's Z instead of S
Ly instead of Lee
It's simple as can be
See, Liza!
I'll do it again...

Now - if my name were Ada,
I'd be Ada,
Even backwards I'd be Ada
Or if my name were Ruth,
Then I'd be Ruth,
Because with Ruth,
What can you do?
Or Sally, or Margaret, or Ginger or Faye
But when you're a Liza
You always have to say...

Oh! And that is only half of it
There's another way
Fate treats me cruelly.
How often I remember someone saying
There she goes, Lisa Minooli!
Or Minoli, or Miniola, or Minili, or Minelie
So is it a wonder, I very often cry?

It's M-I-Double N,
then-E-Double L-I,
You double up the N, thats nn, not ll
Then E, double the L, end it with an I,
That's the way you say Minnelli...
Liza Minnelli,
It's Italian,
Blame it on papa,
What can I do?

Every Sandra
Who's a Sahndra,
Every Mary who's really Marie
Every Joan
Who is a Joanne
Has got to agree with me
When I've announced
I don't mind being pommelled
Or trampled or trounced
But it does drive you bats
To be miss, Miss pronounced...

Then E, double the L, end it with an I,
That's the way you say... Minnelli...
Liza Minnelli!
It's easy!
It's easy! See, it's Leezy!
