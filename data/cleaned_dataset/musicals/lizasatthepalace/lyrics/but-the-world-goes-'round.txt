------ But The World Goes 'Round ------
--- Unknown ---
Sometimes you're happy, sometimes you're sad
But the world goes 'round
Sometimes you lose every nickel you had
But the world goes 'round
--- Unknown ---
Sometimes your dreams get broken in pieces
But that doesn't alter a thing
Take it from me, there's still gonna be
A summer, a winter, a fall and a spring
--- Unknown ---
And sometimes a friend starts treating you bad
But the world goes 'round
And sometimes your heart breaks with a deafening sound
--- Unknown ---
Somebody loses and somebody wins
And one day it's kicks, then it's kicks in the shins
But the planet spins, and the world goes 'round-
But the world goes 'round
But the world goes 'round
--- Unknown ---
Sometimes your dreams get broken in pieces
But that doesn't matter at all
Take it from me, there's still gonna be
A summer, a winter, a spring and a fall
--- Unknown ---
And sometimes a friend starts treating you bad
But the world goes 'round
And sometimes your heart breaks with a deafening sound
--- Unknown ---
Somebody loses and somebody wins
Then one day it's kicks, then it's kicks in the shins
But the planet spins, and the world goes 'round
And 'round and 'round and 'round and 'round
The world goes 'round and 'round and 'round
