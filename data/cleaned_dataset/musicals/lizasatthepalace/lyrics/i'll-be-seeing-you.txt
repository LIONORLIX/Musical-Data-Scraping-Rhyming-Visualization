------ I'll Be Seeing You ------
--- Unknown ---
I'll be seeing you
In all the old familiar places
That this heart of mine embraces
All day through
--- Unknown ---
In that small cafe
The park across the way
The children's carousel
The chestnut tree
The wishing well
--- Unknown ---
I'll be seeing you
In every lovely summer's day
In everything that's light and gay
I'll always think of you that way
--- Unknown ---
I'll find you in the morning sun
And when the night is new
I'll be looking at the moon
