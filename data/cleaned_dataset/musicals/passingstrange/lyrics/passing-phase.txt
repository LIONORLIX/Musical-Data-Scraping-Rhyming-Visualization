------ Passing Phase ------
--- YOUTH ---
--- Unknown ---
You gotta fill the void with music
Fill the void with song
'Til my cup runneth over all night long
--- Unknown ---
I live in vans crammed with guitars
I'll sleep on floors and play in bars
I dance to my own metronome
'Til chaos feels like home
--- Unknown ---
I grow colder,
I grow bolder,
I grow older
And keep fillin' my cup
I grow colder,
I grow bolder,
I grow older,
But I'll never grow up
--- Unknown ---
And this is not a passing phase!
--- OTHERS ---
--- Unknown ---
It was just a passing phase...
--- YOUTH ---
--- Unknown ---
No, this is not a passing phase!
--- OTHERS ---
--- Unknown ---
It was just a passing phase...
--- YOUTH ---
--- Unknown ---
You see, I'll stay on for so long
--- OTHERS ---
--- Unknown ---
It was just a passing phase...
--- YOUTH ---
--- Unknown ---
'Til chaos feels like home...
--- OTHERS ---
--- Unknown ---
It was just a passing phase...
--- YOUTH ---
--- Unknown ---
Up and down from town to town
'Til van wheels go 'round and 'round
Up and down from town to town
'Til van wheels go 'round and 'round
--- Unknown ---
Every night, play rock 'n' roll,
Get fucked up after the show
In the morning, lock and load
And then leave-!

-Right when it was starting to feel real!
--- Unknown ---
Wish we could talk about how the means will not prepare you for the ends...
How your epiphanies become fair-weather friends...
How death will make you lower your defenses...
The only truth of youth is the grown-up consequences...
--- Unknown ---
See, song is a bong,
But song cannot heal
You believed in it too long,
Now I need something more than real...
I need something more than real...
--- Unknown ---
Someday the chords of age will drown out the life you've been dreaming of,
Then you'll be out on your ass,
And cursing the last:
--- Unknown ---
Your song is just passing for love
My song was just passing for love
And you will never see her again
And I will never see her again
And we will never see her again...
