------ Work the Wound ------
--- NARRATOR ---
--- Unknown ---
Everyday I build a mask
Up to the task
Another song, you see
I live behind the rhyme and verse
I lift my voice 'till I lift the curse
It's all rehearsed, you see
This music always rescues me
There's a melody for every malady:
Prescription song, you see
And should the mask begin to fall
My chorus comes in like a twelve foot wall
So you can't see me
And I'm blessed to entertain
The crowd laughs and swoons
It's loud guitars and champagne
And I sleep well past noon
But I've got a lot to explain
To myself, not to you
Like, who lost track of her pain
While working their wound?
So I finally found a home
Between the clicks of a metronome
And the song, you see
Then I went out on a limb
Oh, but the tree disappeared
And the sky went dim
Then, the song changed key
But then you told me my pain entertained
I heard the applause, thanking God you're sane
But what about me?
'Cause I'm cursed to entertain
The crowd laughs too soon
And all I have is my pain
Sharp and way out of tune
Oh, but you know I feel a bit ashamed
Since I'm still here marooned
And you lose track of her pain
When you're working your wound
And you lose track of her pain
When you're working your wound
And you lose track of her pain
When you're working your wound
And you lose track of her love
And you lose track of her pain
I just hop back  on my train
And keep working
I keep working
I keep working
I keep working
I keep working
I keep working
I keep working
And that's how the song goes
That's how the song goes
Hey, that's how the song goes
But the problem is it never stops.
