--- BAND ---
Amsterdam, spring sunshine...
Amsterdam, spring sunshine...
ahhh,ahhh...
--- NARRATOR ---
So now let's jet the scene of the crime,
and touch down in once upon a time.
As Plasticland gives way
To a new world born today.
--- Unknown ---
Amsterdam, spring sunshine,
and the
Wibe is alive and the girls look
fine
He sits in a cafe, like Baldwin
in the day.
--- Unknown ---
Day-glo walls, incense air
lounging 'round in velvet chairs.
So glad he took the trip
Out of the slave-holder's grip.
--- Unknown ---
He knew his destiny was
looming,
And an epiphany was
blooming,
And the lost was gonna get
profound,
And the real was about to go
down.
--- Unknown ---
And he saw that this whole journey through the bowels of the middle-class coon show had led him to this single moment of
utter crystalline clarity, for the Real was to be revealed right here in this very venue!!!
--- YOUTH ---
There's Hashish on the menu!
--- CHORUS ---
Ahhh!
Ahhh!
Ahhh!
Ahhh!
--- RENATA ---
Like another coffee while you
make up your mind?
--- YOUTH ---
Thank you, yes, excuse me, I'm
still startled by the sign.
--- CHRISTOPHE ---
This one's free, man, it's on me,
you don't have to pay.
--- Unknown ---
RENATA;
How's about a sample of the special of the day.
This your first time?
--- YOUTH ---
Does it show? I'm like an ice cube gone to melt.
--- RENATA ---
I hope you find yourself at home.
--- YOUTH ---
I like the cards that i've been dealt.
--- JOOP ---
And how's your mind?
--- YOUTH ---
oh, its blown...it's a vibe i've never felt.
--- RENATA ---
Welcome to Amsterdam!
Amsterdam!
I'm your flight attendant, Miss Renata Hcholiday.
Welcome to Amsterdam!
Amsterdam!
And i welcome you most
happily to our little cafe...
--- CHRISTOPHE ---
Now if you think you're dreaming,
Pinch yourself and look around.
Miracles are commonplace
When you're on holy ground.
--- JOOP ---
Some worship our ho's,
Some kneel before our hash.
--- RENATA ---
Some pray to our Van Goghs,
All yours for a little cash...
Only in..
--- CHORUS/BAND ---
Amsterdam...Amsterdam...!
--- RENATA ---
If we seem too happy,
It's because we truly are.
--- CHORUS/BAND ---
Welcome to Amsterdam...
Amsterdam...
--- JOOP ---
The enlightened aren't frightened,
We let untamed spirits roam.
--- CHORUS/BAND ---
Amsterdam...Amsterdam...
--- CHRISTOPHE ---
But we're the freedom experts,
man,
So don't try this at home!
--- CHORUS/BAND ---
Amsterdam...Amsterdam...
--- RENATA ---
While there ain't no witch or a yellow brick road...
--- MARIANNA ---
It's an emerald city after two bong loads...
--- CHORUS/BAND ---
Amsterdam...Amsterdam...
--- CHRISTOPHE ---
You can trip all day 'till your mind just melts.
--- Unknown ---
JOOP: Makes Berkeley look like the bible belt!
--- CHORUS/BAND ---
Amsterdam...Amsterdam...
