------ We Might Play All Night ------
--- NARRATOR ---
Now you don't know me,
and I don't know you
So let's cut to the chase,
The name is Stew
And I'll be narrating this gig, so just
sit tight,
We might play all night.
--- Unknown ---
Been on the road, me her and
this band
For ten thousand days of one-
night stands,
And oh, by the way, can we
crash on your couch tonight?
I said Is that alright? Is that
alright?
--- BAND ---
Is that alright?
--- NARRATOR ---
But before we cab it back to
your uptown flat,
We're gonna do a little play
since you came for that.
A play where this band tells
you where it's at,
So just follow along,
just follow along.
--- BAND ---
Just follow along...

NARRATOR/HEIDI
Well if this mic feeds back or
the drums rock out,
Or an amp explodes or the bass
player pouts,
Or if you're ever not sure what
we're all about,
Just ask the song.
--- BAND ---
Just ask the song...
--- NARRATOR ---
Just ask the song.
--- Unknown ---
Now since it's my job, ah'ma
set the scene,
In a big two-story, black middle-
class dream.
With all the mod cons, the
manicured lawns,
Some savings bonds, a Boy and
his Mom...
--- BAND ---
A colored paradise where the
palm trees sway,
A colored paradise where the
palm trees sway...
