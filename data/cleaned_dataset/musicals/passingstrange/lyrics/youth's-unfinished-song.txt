------ Youth's Unfinished Song ------
--- YOUTH ---
--- Unknown ---
She left me out of the blue
I now understand that she never knew what was due from me
Why leave me alone?
Her eyes were red but her heart's stone-cold
But she go from me...
--- Unknown ---
I couldn't be her dream
She focused on things that weren't there in me,
Then she split the scene
--- Unknown ---
She wanted me to change
That's not love in my view
Let's inspect the remains:
Oh, she's alone now, too
What's the point of looking for what's not there in you?
--- Unknown ---
You lose track of...
You lose...
[spoken]
How does this song go?
Da da da da da da da da
Da da da da da...
