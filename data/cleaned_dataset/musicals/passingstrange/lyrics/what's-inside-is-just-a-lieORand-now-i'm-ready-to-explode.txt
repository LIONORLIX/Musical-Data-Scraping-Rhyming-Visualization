What's inside is just a lie
And like a catchy refrain that gets trapped in your head
What's inside is just a lie
Somebody else's desires get lodged in your brain.
What's inside is just a lie
So the only way to become your true self

So the real that I've been searching for
Is in the beauty of these burning streets
It's a song I couldn't write yesterday
Till mayday gave me the courage to bleed
I'll write a song called Revolution
'Cause mayday gave me the courage to bleed
And now I'm ready (Yeah!) (x3)
To explode
And now I'm ready (Yeah!) (x3)
To explode
And now I'm ready (Yeah!) (x3)
