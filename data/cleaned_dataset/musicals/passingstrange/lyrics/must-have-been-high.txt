------ Must Have Been High ------
--- Unknown ---
See, Terry?s folks, they went out of town
So they bought a sheet, and they all got down
Chandelier eyes and electric chairs
Visit your mind and spend two days there
--- Unknown ---
Where every song sounds just like an angel?s choir
The edges get rounded, you?ll have wings of fire
Soaring through the sky, they must have been high
They must have been high
--- Unknown ---
Sitting on the balcony watching the rail rust
Time slips through their fingers
--- Unknown ---
Didn?t she vow to live in a tree
While staring at static on the T.V.?
And when she said ?I am a bird? (I am a bird)
He hung on tight and drank every word
--- Unknown ---
And everything matters, it?s so different now
The ashes were scattered, they moved on somehow
Never asking why, they must have been high
They must have been high
--- Unknown ---
Sitting on the balcony watching the rail rust
Time slips through your fingers like angel dust
--- Unknown ---
Slips through your fingers just like angel dust?
