Ladies and jerks, we are,
THE SCARY-OTYPES!

I' at war with Negro morays
I'm at war with girl norms
My mother stand in doorways making me turn to form
Be a good football player ----

Yeah, Im a sole Brother! Up in the mother fucker! x4
So Roots blew your mind? You didn't think it was that bad?
I learned thta shit in 3rd grade, in Miss Menderas' class.
But you're still a bunch of slaves
And you're driving me insane

1234! 1234!
I'm a sole brother!
