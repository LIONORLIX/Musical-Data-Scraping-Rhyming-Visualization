Don't disobey me
Don't even think about going to that audition
Please
No
Mother
Stop
Stop telling me what to do
Don't
Don't treat me like a child of two
No
I know that you want what's best
Please
But mother please, give it a rest
Stop, don't, no, please
Stop, don't, no, please
Stop, don't, no, please
Mama, I'm a big girl now
Once upon a time when I was just a kid
You never let me do just what the older kids did
But lose that laundry list of what you won't allow
'Cause mama, I'm a big girl now
Once upon a time, I used to play with toys
But now I'd rather play around with teenage boys
So if I get a hicky please don't, have a cow
'Cause mama, I'm a big girl now
Ma, I gotta tell you that without a doubt
I get my best dancing lessons from you
You're the one who taught me how to twist and shout
Because you shout non-stop and you're so twisted too
Once I used to fidget 'cause I just sat home
But now I'm just like Gigget, and I gotta get to Rome
So say arrivederci, toodle-loo, and ciao
'Cause mama, I'm a big girl now
Stop, don't, no, please
Stop, don't, no, please
Stop, don't, no, please
Mama, I'm a big girl now
Hey mama
Say mama
Once upon a time I was a shy young thing
Could barely walk and talk so much as dance and sing
But let me hit that stage, I wanna take my bow
'Cause mama, I'm a big girl now
Once upon a time I used to dress up Ken
But now that I'm a woman I like bigger men
And I don't need a Barbie doll to show me how
'Cause mama, I'm a big girl now
Ma, you always taught me what was right from wrong
And now I just wanna give it a try
Mama, I'm been in a nest for far too long
So please give a push and mama watch me fly
Watch me fly
Hey mama
Say mama
One day I will meet a man you won't condemn
And we will have some kids and you can torture them
But let me be a star before I take that vow
'Cause mama, I'm a big girl now
Mama, I'm a big girl now
Mama, big
Such a big, big girl
I'm a big girl now
Stop, don't, no, please
Stop, don't, no, please
Stop, don't, no, please
Mama, I'm a big girl now
Don't disobey me
