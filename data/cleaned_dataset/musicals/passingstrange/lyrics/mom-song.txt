------ Mom Song ------
--- Unknown ---
Narrator: It's breaking her heart
This questioning of everything
Unannounced, he's flown
Out from under your wing
--- Unknown ---
Mother: I'm hardly afraid
Of your new world's strange design
Why don't you make room for me
As I made room for you in mine?
--- Unknown ---
See i've been running from this world
For far longer than you
But I didn't know where else to go
So I hid from it in you
--- Unknown ---
And for a time the world was yours and mine
And that was only yesterday, you see
Now you've got your own life
And it does not include me
--- Unknown ---
Narrator: It's breaking her heart
She says you seem so distant these days
--- Unknown ---
Mother: Unannounced, you've grown
Into a living thing
Into a living thing
Into a living thing
Into a living thing
--- Narrator (overlapping with above) ---
Into a living thing
Into a living thing
Into a living thing
Into a living thing
--- Unknown ---
Chorus: This is your life and it's the only one you've got!
