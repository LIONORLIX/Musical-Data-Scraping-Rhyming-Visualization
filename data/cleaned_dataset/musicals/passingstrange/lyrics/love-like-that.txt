------ Love Like That ------
--- NARRATOR ---
I remember when I owned everything:
The Sun and the Moon and the rain
My domain
Stretched and yawned along the astral plane
--- Unknown ---
The universe is a toy in the mind of a boy
And life is movie, too
Starring you
Your whole family's the cast and crew
That's a little secret between God and you
--- Unknown ---
But ain't it strange how it all makes perfect sense?
Once your life becomes evidence
The need to feel...
Love is more than Real
--- Unknown ---
Because your mother's love might seem insane
It's 'cause she really knows everything
Too bad it takes so long to see what you've been missing...
--- Unknown ---
(Love like that can't be measured anyway)
Too bad it takes so long to see what you've been missing
Too bad it takes so long to see what you've been missing
Too bad it takes so long...
--- Unknown ---
'Cause the Real is a construct is a construct
It's the raw nerve's private zone
It's a personal sunset,
You drive off into Alone.
