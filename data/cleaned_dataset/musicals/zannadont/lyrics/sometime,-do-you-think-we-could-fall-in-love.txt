------ Sometime, Do You Think We Could Fall In Love ------
--- TANK ---
Hold on..the evenings not quite through
Its seems you've lost this.
May I return it now to you.
Tonight you're music meant much more than you could know.
So,I'd just like to say one thing to you before you go.
--- ZANNA ---
Tank,what are you doing?
--- TANK ---
I thought I'd spent my life alone.
Because my feelings felt so wrong.
But now I got the strength to be myself sine I heard you sing your song.
I'm a sort of charming,somewhat handsome,not to princely guy.
Who wants despretly to be with you if youd only let me try.
So,tell me sometime do you think we could fall in love?
How about this Sunday?
Or is tomorrow soon enough?
How about tonight then?
Although I tell ya I dont see
How I'm gunna last that long if we dont fall in love right now.
I know your heart is in a million broken pieces on the floor.
I'll be happy to collect them all,thats what friends are for.
You;ve taken care of everyone,thats always how its been.
But it's time for someone to take care of you, but you have to let them in.
So tell me,sometime do you think we could fall in love?
How about this Sunday?
Or is tomorrow soon enough?
How about tonight then?
Although I tell ya I dont see
How I'm gunna last that long if we dont fall in love right now.
--- ZANNA ---
There you were,always right in front of me,so close to my heart, I simply couldn't see.
There I was making all sort of mistakes.
--- TANK ---
Hey,that's ok,sometimes that's just what it takes
--- ZANNA ---
You've always played everyones songs,and there on key.
--- T AND Z ---
But maybe now we'll get to play one just for you and me.
So tell me,sometime do you think we could fall in love?
How about this Sunday?
Or is tomorrow soon enough?
How about tonight then?
Although I tell ya I dont see
How I'm gunna last that long cuz' I'm fallin in love right now.
--- TANK ---
I think I like other world better.
--- ZANNA ---
How is it that you're the only one who remembers?
