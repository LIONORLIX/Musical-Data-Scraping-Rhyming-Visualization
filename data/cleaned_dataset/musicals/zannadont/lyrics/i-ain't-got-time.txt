------ I Ain't Got Time ------
--- Roberta ---
No, karla. This is the third time you've cheated on me since lunch. I'm a one-woman woman, and you're
Wastin' my time.
And i ain't got time for nothin' but love,
And it's that time.
I ain't got time for nothin' but love,
So don't be wastin' none of mine.
Oh, i ain't got time for nothin' but love,
'Cuz you know life ain't got enough of time
To be wastin' time on anything but love.
Lord, i know the bible says we should spread our love around.
But my woman was gettin' biblical with every girl in town.
'Forgive', they say at sunday mass and i'm nothing if not devout.
So forgive me, lord, my trespasses, but i kicked her ass right out.
'Cuz i ain't got time for nothin' but love,
And it's that time. (customer #1: can i have my coffee now')
I ain't got time for nothin' but love, (customer #2: blue plate special, please')
So don't be wastin' none of mine.
Oh, i ain't got time for nothin' but love,
'Cuz you know life ain't got enough of time (c1,2,3: side of french fries)
To be wastin' time on anything but love. ('cuz i ain't got time)
Lord, i hate to bug you, but i'd like to ask if i may
Could you someday send me someone who won't dump me the next day'
I'm not askin' for perfection, or a heavenly paragon
Just someone strong enough to rip my head off...
But smart enough to sew it back on.
'Cuz i ain't got time for nothin' but love,
And it's that time. (c1,2,3: oh it's that time.)
I ain't got time for nothin' but love,
So don't be wastin' none of mine. (oh, don't be wastin' none of mine.)
Oh, i ain't got time for nothin' but love, (tick tock)
'Cuz you know life ain't got enough of time (your luck's run out the clock)
To be wastin' time on anything but love. (so don't waste my precious time.)
Padre' you and me are pretty tight now, right'
So i do hope you can appreciate this in the spirit in which it is intended'
I try to lead the good life; i do penance for my misdeeds.
But saturday night, when the moon is right,
Lord i got womanly needs!
(c1,2,3): so you ain't got time for nothin' but love,
I ain't got time for nothin' but love, (oh don't be wastin' none of mine)
So don't be wastin' none of mine.
Oh, i ain't got time for nothin' but love, (tick tock)
'Cuz you know life ain't got enough of time (your luck's run out the clock.)
To be wastin' time on anything but love. (so don't waste my precious time.)
I'm not wastin' time on anything but love!
I'm not wastin' time... On anything...
But...love!
(oh it's that time, oh it's that time, oh it's that time, oh it's that time.
Don't be wastin' none of my love, 'cuz honey i ain't got time.)
