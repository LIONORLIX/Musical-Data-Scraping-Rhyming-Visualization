------ Someday You Might Love Me ------
--- Unknown ---
Once upon a time
You'd all come to me
I'd do anything for you
Whatever it might be
--- Unknown ---
Now you all point and laugh
You seem so amused
But I don't know what I have done
Help me... I'm confused
--- Unknown ---
You clapped and cheered for me
The whole year through
And though so much has changed
I haven't... have you
--- Unknown ---
I taught your hearts how to love
Your souls how to kiss
I taught you all that I know
I didn't teach you this
--- Unknown ---
Someday you might love me
Someday you might care
Someday you might come and find me
And find that I'm not there
--- Unknown ---
We gathered for a moment
And we laughed and cried and played
From now on the magic's gone
This is what it made
--- Unknown ---
How can you look into me
And not see yourselves how
Man, woman, gay, straight
All things in between
I leave no one out
--- Unknown ---
Someday you might love me
Someday you might care
Someday you might come and find me
And find that I'm not there
--- Unknown ---
Someday you might come and find me
