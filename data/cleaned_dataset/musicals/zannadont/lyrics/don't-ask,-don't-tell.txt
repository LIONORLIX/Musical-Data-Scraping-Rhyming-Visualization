STEVE: Am I dead?
KATE: Sshhh!
STEVE: Are you'an angel?
KATE: No. Just a woman.
STEVE: You healed me. How?
KATE: Through an open mind.
STEVE: You are an angel.
KATE: Sshhh...We mustn't?
STEVE: Can I do this?
KATE: Don't ask.
STEVE: Can I think this?
KATE: Don't tell.
STEVE: Can I feel this?
KATE: Don't say anything;
We both know very well.
STEVE: But if I feel this
KATE: Don't ask.
STEVE: I want to tell you.
KATE: Don't tell.
STEVE: I want to say to you
KATE: Don't say anything;
STEVE: Just what this is.
KATE: We both know very well.
If we parachute into battle
and you happen to get stuck in a tree,
then I cut you loose and then run away
without telling you it was me,
that is how I'll kiss you.
STEVE: If we're ever in the same tank or submarine,
and I refuse to share your periscope,
then you'll know what I mean ?
that is how I'll kiss you.
KATE: Don't ask don't tell
STEVE: Don't ask don't tell don't ask
KATE: Here. Take my dog tag. As a memento...
STEVE: ...of a love that could never be.
BOTH: Don't tell.
MIKE: Wow, that was great!
ROBERTA: I'm so proud of you.
MIKE: This show is really going to help fight heterophobia.
ROBERTA: Oh, listen, honey, I've gotta get to the diner.
MIKE: And I've gotta run to chess practice.
ROBERTA: We?ll see you guys later.
MIKE: You two were perfect.
KATE: If I pass you in the hall,
And I turn my eyes away;
if I have to say hello to you
and I don't say your name ?
that is how I'll  kiss you.
STEVE: If I see you, and I sit across the room;
if I meet you in a group of friends
and turn my back on you ?
that is how I'll  kiss you.
KATE: I wish our lives could go on
STEVE: That is how I'll  kiss you.
KATE: within the confines of this song.
STEVE: That is how I'll  kiss you.
KATE: For once it ends, what will be there
STEVE: That is how I'll kiss you.
KATE: Only the silence I can't bear.
STEVE: Can I do this?
KATE: Don't ask.
STEVE: Can I think this?
KATE: Don't tell.
STEVE: Can I feel this?
KATE: Don't say anything;
We both know very well.
STEVE: But if I feel this
KATE: Don't ask.
STEVE: I want to tell you.
KATE: Don't tell.
STEVE: I want to say to you
KATE: Don't say anything
STEVE: Just what this is.
KATE: We both know very well.
