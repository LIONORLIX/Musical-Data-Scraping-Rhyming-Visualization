If it didn't go fast, could rock-n-roll make you wanna twist,
Make you wanna shout, make you wanna dance?
And if it didn't go fast, would a roller coaster make you wanna scream,
Make you wanna gasp, make you wanna wet your pants?
--- Tex ---
And if it didn't go fast, could fast food have ever caught on?
You gotta order fast, eat fast, leave.
You can slow up for the drive through a little bit, but if you gotta do,
You gotta order fast, eat fast, leave.

'Cuz if it didn't go fast, it would never really last, so it better go fast.

Listen up now.
And if it didn't go fast, would kittyhawk have ever taken off,
Would a man have ever made it to the moon?
And if it didn't go fast, could the enterprise enter hyperspace,
Could superman ever catch a goon?

Or how about batman, thing, the flash, or flash gordon,
Spiderman, or supergirl, or thor?

Or how about the x-men, mod squad, josie and the pussycats,
Scooby doo, the fantastic four?

They all went fast, 'cuz they had to go fast, 'cuz they wanted to last.
We fall in love fast, so we can take the rest of life slow;
'Cause once you've gone to love, there ain't no place else to go.
So you better fall in love fast,or someone else just might.
Gentlemen, start your engines; buckle your seatbelts tight!
