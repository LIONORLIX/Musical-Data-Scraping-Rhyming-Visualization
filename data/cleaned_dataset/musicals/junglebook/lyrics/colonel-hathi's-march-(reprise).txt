------ Colonel Hathi's March (Reprise) ------
--- Unknown ---
Oh, we march from here to there
And it doesn't matter where
You can hear us push
Through the deepest bush
With a military air!
With a military air!
--- Unknown ---
We're a cracker jack brigade
On a pachyderm parade
But we'd rather stroll to a water hole
For a furlough in the shade!
