------ Trust In Me (The Python's Song) ------
--- Unknown ---
Trust in me, just in me
Shut your eyes and trust in me
You can sleep safe and sound
Knowing I am around
--- Unknown ---
Slip into silent slumber
Sail on a silver mist
Slowly and surely your senses
Will cease to resist
--- Unknown ---
Trust in me, just in me
