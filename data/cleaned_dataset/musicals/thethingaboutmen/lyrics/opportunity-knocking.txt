------ Opportunity Knocking ------
--- Unknown ---
Tom: He needs a roommate, he’s out of money
I need a room ..hahaha.. isn’t that funny
I hear opportunity knocking . And it’s time to answer the door
There’s a man in my Christmas stocking
Knock knock, welcome to hell. .. I’m your brand new roommate
Yes, I hear opportunity knocking .. knocking him up side of his head
My ship’s come in and baby I’m docking (yeah yeah)
No!  This is depraved and immoral, and one thing that’s for sure,
He’ll find out,   I’m lying
Every second I’ll be Lying, lying, lying
But after all I’m in advertising
So I suppose I know how to lie
I’ll admit I’m rationalizing, so what
He deserves it, I can do it .. I will do it .. screw it, opportunity’s knocking
And I’ve got a plan .. Oh brother if she’s your woman, then baby I’m your man
