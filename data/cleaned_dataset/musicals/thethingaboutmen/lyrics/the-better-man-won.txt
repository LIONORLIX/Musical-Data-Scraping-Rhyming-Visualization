------ The Better Man Won ------
--- Tom ---
Raise a glass, let’s toast a good fight
All things pass, and some turn out right
15 years, it was quite a run
Screw the tears, the better man won
--- Unknown ---
What i did, i did from the heart
But, why kid, i wasn’t too smart
Close the book, the tale has been spawn
Take a look, the better man won
--- Unknown ---
I hope he loves you madly, treats you kindly, takes good care
I hope he pays attention, may he be your every prayer
--- Unknown ---
I hope your days are happy, and you sometimes think of me
I hope he’s everything that i could never be
--- Unknown ---
That’s the game, my friend took the prize
I became a little more wise
Early frost, my summer is done
One man lost, one man lost, the better man won
The better man won
