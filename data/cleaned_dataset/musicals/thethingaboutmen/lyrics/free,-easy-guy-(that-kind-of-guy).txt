------ Free, Easy Guy (That Kind Of Guy) ------
--- Sebastian ---
Some men walk down corporate halls
Swinging their balls, making big dough
Some men spend their lives trading stock
Slaves to the clock, ready to blow
Oh, I’m not a suit, I’m not a tie
Please let me specify
I’m just a very artistic, happy, holistic
Thank God, I’m a free, easy guy

Next time you are stuck at a desk, So Kaufka-esque. Give me a call
You can find me down by a pond, squeezing a blond, having a ball
So let’s get real and let’s not lie, We don’t see eye to eye
You’re just a capitalistic, working statistic, Too bad, you’re not free
Oh you are in some trouble I guess, Drowning in stress, do not despair
I can help you learn how to live, love and forgive, I’ll take you there
Cause I believe the day I die, I’ll thank the lord that I was just a
very artistic, happy, holistic, Real optimistic,  ok, narcissistic,  joyous and healing
With Deep inner feeling, A Thank God, I’m a free easy guy, Ohh’ yeah!

Some men live downtown in a dump, happy to hump, other men’s wives
Romeo has now met his match, batten each hatch
See who survives
I love my suit, I love my tie
And let me clarify
He’s just a semi-artistic, shallow simplistic, Thank god, I’m not him, easy guy
