------ Sleepy Time Gal ------
--- Unknown ---
Sleepy time gal,
You're turning night into day,
Sleepy time gal,
You've danced the evening away.
Before each silvery star
Fades out o' sight,
Just give me one little kiss,
Then let us whisper goodnight.
--- Unknown ---
It's gettin' late and dear, your pillow's waitin'!
--- Unknown ---
Sleepy time gal,
When all your dancin' is through,
Sleepy time gal,
I'll find a cottage for you.
You'll learn to cook and to sew,
What's more, you'll love it I know
When you're a stay at home,
Play at home,
Eight o'clock sleepy time gal.

And "Ten Little Fingers And Ten Little Toes",
Oh What A Pal Was Mary and Margie and Secondhand Rose,
Alice Blue Gown and Sometimes I'm Happy and Do It Again,
And Sweet Georgia Brown and Stouthearted Men.
--- Unknown ---
To continue,
If I Had The Wings Of An Angel and Dinah,
Or Love Me Or Leave Me or Constantinople,
Songs about Susie and Sal,
Not to mention
A stay at home,
Play at home,
