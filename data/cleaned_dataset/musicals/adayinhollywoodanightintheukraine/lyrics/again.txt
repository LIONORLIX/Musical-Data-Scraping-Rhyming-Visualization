------ Again ------
--- Unknown ---
A-gain,
This couldn't happen again,
This is that once in a life-time,
This is the thrill divine.
What's more,
This never happened before,
Though I have prayed for a life-time
That such as you would suddenly be mine.
Mine to hold as I'm holding you now,
And yet ever so near,
Mine to have when the now and the here disappear.
What matters, dear,
For when this doesn't happen
Again,
We'll have this moment forever,
But never, never,
