--- Unknown ---
Wonderful! Oh, it's wonderful
To be in love with you.
Beautiful! You're so beautiful,
You haunt me all day through.
--- Unknown ---
Every little breeze seems to whisper "Louise."
Birds in the trees seem to twitter Louise.
Each little rose
Tells me it knows I love you, love you.
--- Unknown ---
Every little beat that I feel in my heart,
Seems to repeat, What I felt from the start,
Each little sigh
Tells me that I adore you, Louise.
--- Unknown ---
Just to see and hear you
Brings joy I never knew.
But to be so near you,
Thrills me through and through.
--- Unknown ---
Anyone can see why I wanted your kiss,
It had to be But the wonder is this:
Can it be true,
Someone like you could love me, Louise?
--- Unknown ---
Innocent! You're so innocent
And gentle as a dove.
Heaven sent! You were heaven sent,
An angel from above.

Every little breeze seems to whisper "Louise."
Birds in the trees seem to twitter Louise.
Each little rose
Tells me it knows I love you, love you.
--- Unknown ---
Every little beat that I feel in my heart,
Seems to repeat, What I felt from the start,
Each little sigh
Tells me that I adore you, Louise.
--- Unknown ---
Often when I'm gloomy
And in my lonely room.
Thoughts of you come to me,
Like a sweet perfume.
--- Unknown ---
Anyone can see why I wanted your kiss,
It had to be But the wonder is this:
Can it be true,
