DO YOU SEE THIS TREE?
IT IS A FIR TREE.
IT'S CALLED A FIR TREE BECAUSE IT GIVES US FUR FOR COATS.
IT ALSO GIVES US WOOL IN THE WINTER TIME.
--- LINUS ---
I never knew that before, Lucy. That's very interesting.
--- LUCY ---
THIS IS AN ELM TREE.
IT'S VERY LITTLE
BUT IT WILL GROW UP INTO A GIANT TREE...
AN OAK.
YOU CAN TELL HOW OLD IT IS BY COUNTING IT'S LEAVES.
--- LINUS ---
Gosh Lucy, that's fascinating.
--- CHARLIE BROWN ---
Now wait a minute Lucy! I don't mean to interfere, but...

AND WAY UP THERE THOSE FLUFFY LITTLE WHITE THINGS,
THOSE ARE CLOUDS,
THEY MAKE THE WIND BLOW.
AND WAY DOWN THERE,
THOSE TINY LITTLE BLACK THINGS...
THOSE ARE BUGS
THEY MAKE THE GRASS GROW.
--- LINUS ---
Is that so?
--- LUCY ---
That's right! They run around all day,
tugging and tugging on each tiny seedling until it grows into a great tall blade of grass!
--- LINUS ---
Boy, that's amazing!
--- CHARLIE BROWN ---
Oh, good grief!

THE LITTLE STARS AND PLANETS
MAKE THE RAIN THAT OFTEN SHOWERS.

THE SNOW COMES UP!
JUST LIKE THE FLOWERS.
--- CHARLIE BROWN ---
Now Lucy, I know that's wrong! Snow doesn't come up, it comes down!!
--- LUCY ---
After it comes up, the wind blows it around so it looks like it's coming down,
but actually it comes up out of the ground, just like grass. It comes up,
Charlie Brown, snow comes up!
--- CHARLIE BROWN ---
Oh, Good Grief! (He exits, from off stage there is a hollow thumping sound.)
