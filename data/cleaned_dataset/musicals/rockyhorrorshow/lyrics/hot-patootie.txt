------ Hot Patootie ------
--- Unknown ---
Whatever happened to Saturday night
When you dressed up sharp and you felt alright?
It don't seem the same since cosmic light
Came into my life, I thought I was divine...
--- Unknown ---
I used to go for a ride with a chick who'd go
And listen to the music on the radio
A saxophone was blowin' on a rock & roll show.
You climbed in the back seat, you really had a good time.
--- Unknown ---
Hot patootie, bless my soul, I really love that rock 'n' roll.
--- Unknown ---
My head used to swim from the perfume I smelled
My hands kind of fumbled with her white plastic belt
I'd taste her baby pink lipstick and that's when I'd melt
She'd whisper in my ear tonight she really was mine
--- Unknown ---
Get back in front, put some hair oil on
Buddy Holly was singing his very last song.
With your arms around your girl you'd try to sing along.
It felt pretty good, oh, you really had a good time.
