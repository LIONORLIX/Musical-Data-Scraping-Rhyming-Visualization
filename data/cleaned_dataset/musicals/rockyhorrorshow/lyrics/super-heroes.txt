------ Super Heroes ------
--- Unknown ---
I've done a lot, God knows I've tried
To find the truth, I've even lied
But all I know is down inside I'm bleeding.
--- Unknown ---
And Super Heroes come to feast
To taste the flesh not yet deceased
And all I know is still the beast is feeding.
--- Unknown ---
And crawling on the planet's face
Some insects called the human race
Lost in time, lost in space
