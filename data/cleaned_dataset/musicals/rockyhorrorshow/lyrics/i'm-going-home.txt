------ I'm Going Home ------
--- Unknown ---
On the day I went away... goodbye...
Was all I had to say... now I...
I want to come again and stay... Oh my my...
Smile, and that will mean that I may
--- Unknown ---
Cause I've seen blue skies, through the tears
In my eyes
And I realise.. I'm going home.
--- Unknown ---
Everywhere it's been the same... feeling...
Like I'm outside in the rain... wheeling...
Free, to try and find a game... dealing...
Cards for sorrow, cards for pain
--- Unknown ---
Cause I've seen blue skies through the tears
In my eyes
And I realise.. I'm going home.
