------ Once In A While ------
--- Unknown ---
Once in a while she don't want to call you
Speaking on the telephone
And once in your life she won't want to know you
You look around, the one you found she is gone
--- Unknown ---
And that's all the time that it takes
For a heart to turn to stone
The sweeter the wine the harder to make the break
You hear something about someone you thought you'd known
--- Unknown ---
So baby don't cry like there's no tomorrow
After the night there's brand new day
And there'll be no pain and no more sorrow
So wash your face and phone my place, it'll be okay.
--- Unknown ---
And that's all the time that it takes
For a heart to beat again
So give me a sign that a lover makes
------ fin ------
