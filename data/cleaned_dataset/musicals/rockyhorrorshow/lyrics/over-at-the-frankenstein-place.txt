------ Over At The Frankenstein Place ------
--- Unknown ---
In the velvet darkness of the blackest night
Burning bright, there's a guiding star
No matter what or who you are.
--- Unknown ---
There's a light over at the Frankenstein Place
There's a light burning in the fireplace
There's a light, light in the darkness of everybody's life.
--- Unknown ---
I can see the flag fly, I can see the rain
Just the same, there has got to be
Something better here for you and me.
--- Unknown ---
There's a light over at the Frankenstein Place
There's a light burning in the fireplace
There's a light, light in the darkness of everybody's life.
--- Unknown ---
The darkness must go down the river of nights dreaming
Flow morphia slow, let the sun and light come streaming
Into my life, into my life.
--- Unknown ---
There's a light over at the Frankenstein Place
There's a light burning in the fireplace
