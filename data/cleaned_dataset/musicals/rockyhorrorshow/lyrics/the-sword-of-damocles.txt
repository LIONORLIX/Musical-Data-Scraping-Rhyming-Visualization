------ The Sword Of Damocles ------
--- Unknown ---
The sword of Damocles is hanging over my head
And I've got the feeling someone's gonna be cutting the thread
Oh, woe is me, my life is a misery
Oh, can't you see that I'm at the start of a pretty big downer?
--- Unknown ---
I woke up this morning with a start when I fell out of bed
And left from my dreaming was a feeling of unnameable dread
My high is low, I'm dressed up with no place to go
And all I know, is I'm at the start of a pretty big downer...
--- Unknown ---
Sha-la-la-la that ain't no crime
That ain't no crime
--- Unknown ---
Rocky Horror you need peace of mind
And I want to tell you that you're doing just fine
You're the product of another time
And feeling down, well that's no crime...
