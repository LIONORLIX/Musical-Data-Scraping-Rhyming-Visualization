------ Sweet Transvestite ------
--- Unknown ---
How d'you do, I see you've met my faithful handyman
He's just a little brought down because when you knocked
He thought you were the candyman.
Don't get strung out by the way that I look,
Don't judge a book by its cover
I'm not much of a man by the light of day,
But by night I'm one hell of a lover
--- Unknown ---
I'm just a Sweet Transvestite from Transexual, Transylvania.
--- Unknown ---
So let me show you around, maybe play you a sound
You look like you're both pretty groovy
Or if you want something visual that's not too abysmal
We could take in an old Steve Reeves movie.
--- Unknown ---
I'm glad we caught you at home, could we use your phone?
We're both in a bit of a hurry.
We'll just say where we are, then go back to the car
We don't want to be any worry.
--- Unknown ---
So you got caught with a flat, well, how about that?
Well babies, don't you panic.
By the light of the night when it all seems alright
I'll get you a satanic mechanic.
--- Unknown ---
I'm just a Sweet Transvestite from Transexual, Transylvania.
--- Unknown ---
So why don't you stay for the night? Or maybe a bite?
I could show you my favourite obsession.
I've been making a man with blond hair and a tan
And he's good for relieving my tension
--- Unknown ---
I'm just a Sweet Transvestite from Transexual, Transylvania.
--- Unknown ---
So come up to the lab. And see what's on the slab.
I see you shiver with antici... pation!
But maybe the rain isn't really to blame
