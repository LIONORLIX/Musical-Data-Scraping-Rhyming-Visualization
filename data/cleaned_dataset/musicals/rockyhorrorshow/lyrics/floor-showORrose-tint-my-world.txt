------ Floor Show/Rose Tint My World ------
--- Unknown ---
It was great when it all began
I was a regular Frankie fan
But it was over when he had the plan
To start a-working on a muscle man
Now the only that gives me hope
Is my love for a certain dope
Rose tints my world keeps me safe from my trouble and pain.
--- Unknown ---
I'm just seven hours old
Truly beautiful to behold
And somebody should be told
My libido hasn't been controlled
Now the only thing I've come to trust
Is an orgasmic rush of lust
Rose tints my world keeps me safe from my trouble and pain.
--- Unknown ---
It's beyond me, help me Mommy
I'll be good you'll see, take this dream away
What's this, let's see
Oh I feel sexy
What's come over me?
Oh here it comes again...
--- Unknown ---
Oh I feel released
Bad times deceased
My confidence has increased
Reality is here
The game has been disbanded, my mind has been expanded
It's a gas that Frank has landed
