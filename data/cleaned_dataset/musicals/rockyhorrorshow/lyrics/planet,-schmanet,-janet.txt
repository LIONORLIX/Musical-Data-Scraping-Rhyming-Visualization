I'll tell you once, I won't tell you twice.
You'd better wise up Janet Weiss.
Your apple pie don't taste too nice
You'd better wise up, Janet Weiss
--- Unknown ---
I've laid the seed it should be all you need
You're as sensual as a pencil,
Wound up like an E or a first string
When we made it, did you hear a bell ring?
--- Unknown ---
You got a block? Well, take my advice
You better wise up Janet Weiss.
The transducer will seduce ya.
--- Unknown ---
It's something you'll get used to -
A mental mind fuck can be nice.

(You won't find Earth people quite the easy mark you imagine.
This sonic transducer - it is, I suppose,
some kind of audio-vibratory physio-molecular transport device?)
(Yes, Brad, it's something we ourselves have been working on for quite some time.
But it seems our friend here has found a means of perfecting it.
A device which is capable of breaking down solid matter
and then projecting it through space and,
who knows, perhaps even time itself!)

Planet, schmanet, Janet!
--- Unknown ---
You better wise up Janet Weiss.
You better wise up, build your thighs up, You better wise up
--- Unknown ---
(And then she cried out...)
--- Unknown ---
Don't get hot and flustered, use a bit of mustard
--- Unknown ---
You're a hot dog, but you better not try to hurt her,
Frank Furter.
You're a hot dog, but you'd better not try to hurt her,
