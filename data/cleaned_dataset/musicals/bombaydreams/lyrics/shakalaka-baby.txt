Shakalaka baby, shakalaka baby
Shakalaka baby, shakalaka baby
--- Unknown ---
Saw your face and the damage was done
You waked a spell that took me over
A brighter bulb right out of the sun
A lotus scented supernova
--- Unknown ---
Catch the rythem, jump to the beat
The nights are warm and my words are tender
Can't escape, feel the heat
Lose yourself and the sweet surrender
--- Unknown ---
(Woah-oh-oh-oh)
And the planets are colliding
Fantasies are flying
Simply no denying
There you are my Bombay lover...
--- Unknown ---
Shakalaka baby, shakalaka baby
This is how it's really meant to be
Shakalaka baby, shakalaka baby
Come and shakalaka with me
Shakalaka baby, shakalaka baby
Nothing here is ever what it seems
Shakalaka baby, shakalaka baby
Let me take you with me in my dreams
--- Unknown ---
No no no no no no no no no x4
--- Unknown ---
In a trance going out of my mind
You made a flame that keeps me burning
Come on baby, give me a sign
One look from you and the world stops turning
--- Unknown ---
(Woah-oh-oh-oh)
Music gets exciting
I need you here beside me
I know you'll satisfy me
There you are my Bombay lover...
--- Unknown ---
Shakalaka baby, shakalaka baby
This is how it's really meant to be
Shakalaka baby, shakalaka baby
Come and shakalaka with me
Shakalaka baby, shakalaka baby
I just wanna love you everyday
Shakalaka baby, shakalaka baby
Promise me you'll never go away
--- Unknown ---
No no no no no no no no no x4
--- Unknown ---
Secret moon and enchanted dreams
Pray we share many nights like these
Million stars in the sky...
--- Unknown ---
Oh oh, oh oh
--- Unknown ---
Shakalaka baby, shakalaka baby
Shakalaka baby, shakalaka baby
--- Unknown ---

Shakalaka baby, shakalaka baby
This is how it's really meant to be
Shakalaka baby, shakalaka baby
Come and shakalaka with me
Shakalaka baby, shakalaka baby
Loving you is all I need to know
Shakalaka baby, shakalaka baby
Now you're here I'll never let you go
