------ Bombay Dreams ------
--- Unknown ---
Sunrise, burning heat
Nothing is as travelled as a Bombay street
Contradictions, city of extremes
Anything is possible in Bombay dreams
Some live and die in debt
Others making millions on the Internet
Contradictions, city of extremes
Anything is possible in Bombay dreams
--- Unknown ---
This __ is coming! Hip hip hooray!
CNN cameras are here in Bombay
The slums have to be painted right away
Or next year __ will come from L.A.!
--- Unknown ---
We eunuchs bring you luck
Give us money, you will see
I can change your fortune
If you are kind to me
But if you refuse us
You'll face adversity
Even though we're not
The men we used to be
--- Unknown ---
Life's never easy
Every day you struggle through
You lean on me
I lean on you
--- Unknown ---
Life's never easy
Every day's an uphill fight
Prayers are ignored(?)
