------ Closer Than Ever ------
--- Unknown ---
Priya
There'll come a morning
When we'll awaken
Closer than ever
Slowly but surely
Sooner or later
Closer than ever
Breathing the same air
Dreaming the same dreams
Closer than ever before
--- Unknown ---
Priya & Akaash
There'll come a moment
When I will hold you
Closer than ever
Fairy-tale romance
Princess and hero
Closer than ever
Like an old movie
Where strangers end up
Closer than ever before
--- Unknown ---
Akaash
All of a sudden
Just like a shower
Our love will flower
Life will have meaning
--- Unknown ---
Priya
Worth living for
--- Unknown ---
Akaash
Worth living for
--- Unknown ---
Priya
Worth dying for
--- Unknown ---
Akaash
Worth dying for
--- Unknown ---
Both
There'll come a morning
When we'll awaken
Closer than ever before
--- Unknown ---
Priya
Closer than ever
--- Unknown ---
Both
