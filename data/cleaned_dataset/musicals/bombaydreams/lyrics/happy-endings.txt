------ Happy Endings ------
--- Unknown ---
Priya
Happy ending's all you know
Sing and dance your life away
It's time you realized
Real life is black and white
And heroes don't fly
Sometimes they cry
--- Unknown ---
Times are changing for the better
Out there is a new Bombay
Human struggle, gritty drama
Stories with something to say
--- Unknown ---
Your head's been in the clouds
Since I was a little girl
You brought me clothes to wear
But were never there
--- Unknown ---
Madan
Your life has been one big parade
Because of all the deals I made
Yes, it's true, I had to mix
With men who are corrupt
But that's what you do
And so will you

Priya
Educating, stimulating
That's how movies could be
--- Unknown ---
Madan
Gangsters lying, mothers crying
That's how movies should be
--- Unknown ---
Priya
Motivating, penetrating
That's how movies could be
--- Unknown ---
Madan
Heroes flying, villains dying
That's how movies could be
--- Unknown ---
Priya
Happy ending's all you know
--- Unknown ---
Madan
What's so wrong with happy endings?
Chance for people to escape
--- Unknown ---
Priya
There are those who want to learn
There are those who like to think
And not every one
Lives to have fun
