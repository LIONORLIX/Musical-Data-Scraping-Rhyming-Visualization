------ Journey Home ------
--- Unknown ---
Akaash
The journey home
Is never too long
Your heart arrives before the train
The journey home
Is never too long
Some yesterdays always remain
I'm going back to where my heart was light
When my pillow was a ship I sailed through the night
--- Unknown ---
The journey home
Is never too long
When open arms are waiting there
The journey home
Is never too long
There's room to love and room to spare
I want to feel the way that I did then
I'll think my wishes through before I wish again
--- Unknown ---
Not every road you come across
Is one you have to take
No, sometimes standing still can be
The best move you ever make
--- Unknown ---
The journey home
Is never too long
One helps to heal the deepest pain
The journey home
Is never too long
