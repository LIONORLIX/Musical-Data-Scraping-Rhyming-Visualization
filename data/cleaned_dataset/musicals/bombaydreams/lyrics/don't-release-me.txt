------ Don't Release Me ------
--- Unknown ---
Madan
You said I would rot in jail
And you'd throw the key away
I feel safer behind bars
I'll have time to write my memoirs
I'm a monster, I'm a beast
I should never, never be released
I have rigged a mongoose fight
And smoked a cigar on an Air India flight
--- Unknown ---
Don't release me
Don't release me
Don't release me
Don't set me free
Don't release me
Don't release me
Don't release me
Don't set him free
--- Unknown ---
I'm too bad to be let out
There's things you don't know about
Want a passport? Talk to me
I have a warehouse full of duty free
--- Unknown ---
Don't release me
Don't release me
Don't release me
Don't set me free
Don't release me
Don't release me
Don't release me
Don't set him free
--- Unknown ---
Living in this place does suit me
No one here's trying to shoot me
I'll give you movie masterpieces
Like my previous releases
When my next one's in the can
It'll be bigger than Star Wars or Spiderman
--- Unknown ---
Throw away the key
Don't set him free
--- Unknown ---
Don't release me
Don't release me
Don't release me
Don't set me free
Don't release me
Don't release me
Don't release me
