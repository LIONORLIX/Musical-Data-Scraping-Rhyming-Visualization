------ Like an Eagle ------

Akaash
There's a place where I can take you
You will not believe your eyes
It's the journey of a lifetime
Where imagination flies
If you believe
Watch me step into my dream
--- Unknown ---
Like the eagle
Was born to fly
Right across the open sky
I was born
To be seen on a screen
In Bollywood
--- Unknown ---
Everybody has their moment
When their world begins to shine
Got to keep the fire inside you
Everything will turn out fine
If you believe
Watch me step into my dream
--- Unknown ---
Like the eagle
Was born to fly
Right across the open sky
I was born
To be seen on a screen
In Bollywood
--- Unknown ---
Like the eagle
Was born to soar
High above the ocean's roar
I was born
To believe in the dream
Of Bollywood
