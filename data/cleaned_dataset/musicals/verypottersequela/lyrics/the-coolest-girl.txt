------ The Coolest Girl ------
--- Unknown ---
Hermione
--- Unknown ---
All my dreams
I'm chasing after,
They don't need
All this laughter...
--- Unknown ---
I take a grain of salt,
A stiff upper lip.
It's not their fault
I'm not as hip.
Wake up kid, you know you're more than this...
--- Unknown ---
I'm the smartest person
That i've ever met.
So why do i allow myself to
Possibly forget:
--- Unknown ---
There's so much i know how to do,
So much more than all of you.
The only thing i wish i knew
Was how to make them see
The girl that i can be....
--- Unknown ---
I am
The coolest girl in the whole wide world
I know it
But can't show it at all.
--- Unknown ---
I am
Sick and tired
Of low, not higher
Places, where i should belong...
It's about time i proved them wrong...
--- Unknown ---
Give me a shot
To show what i've got!
I'm a hell of a whole lot more
--- Unknown ---
Than this frizzy hair,
These frumpy clothes i wear,
Though i rock 'em like nobody you've seen
Before!
--- Unknown ---
'Cause i am
The coolest girl in the whole wide world
I know it
Below it all.
--- Unknown ---
I am
Done with losin',
On with choosin'
--- Unknown ---
The coolest girl on the face of the planet,
The coolest bitch on earth, goddammit!
The coolest chick you've ever seen or heard!
--- Unknown ---
So you can try to break me down,
But sorry guys, i'm stickin' around!
I've thought about it, and i've found
--- Unknown ---
That i am
The coolest girl!
...yeah!
