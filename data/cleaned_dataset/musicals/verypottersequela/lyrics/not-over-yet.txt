------ Not Over Yet ------
--- Lucius ---
--- Unknown ---
Don't ever tell me what i can't do
I'd watch my tongue if i were you
For all we know, you-know-who
Could be watching us
--- Yaxley ---
--- Unknown ---
[spoken] "he can't be, he's dead!"
--- Lucius ---
--- Unknown ---
That never stopped our plans before
You've no idea what i have in store!
You really think that you'd be at my door
If we had nothing to discuss?
He may be gone, but that is just as well...
--- Unknown ---
So come inside, don't you fret
For it's not over yet!
--- Death eater chorus ---
--- Unknown ---
Evil plans!
We are making evil plans!
Evil deeds with evil hands!
We love making evil plans!
--- Lucius ---
--- Unknown ---
I know it seems impossible, we've been thrown
Off our track.
But if we can't move forward, why shouldn't we
Move back?
--- Friends and companions of evil and sin ---
Think not of loss, but a new way to win.
For what is present without a beginning
To start it all?
--- Yaxley ---
--- Unknown ---
[spoken] "go on..."
--- Lucuis ---
--- Unknown ---
There is a boy that everyone knows;
The plan is simple: i propose that
We choke the weed before it grows
Up and ends it all
--- Unknown ---
Do you follow me?
--- Death eater #1 ---
--- Unknown ---
[spoken] "no."
--- Lucius ---
--- Unknown ---
The dark lord?
Would have survived, had they never met...
--- Death eater #2 ---
--- Unknown ---
[spoken] "so you're saying that he wouldn't
Be destroyed?
--- Lucius ---
--- Unknown ---
He'd be alive, what don't you get?
--- Death eater #3 ---
--- Unknown ---
[spoken] "still not understanding..."
--- Lucius ---
--- Unknown ---
With potter gone, the future will be set!
--- Death eaters ---
--- Unknown ---
[spoken] "aaahhhhhh!"
--- Lucius ---
--- Unknown ---
... So it's not over yet!
--- Death eaters ---
--- Unknown ---
Evil plans!
What a brilliant evil plan!
Malfoy, you're an evil man!
We love making evil plans!
--- All ---
--- Unknown ---
Our history is nothing more
Than what the losers settle for
--- Lucius ---
--- Unknown ---
So look alive, and don't forget
That's it's not over
--- All ---
--- Unknown ---
It's not over,
No, it's not over yet!
