------ Stutter (You Were Never My Lover) ------
--- Umbridge ---
--- Unknown ---
Remember that time?
When you wouldn't talk to me?
No you wouldn't talk to me
Yesterday.
--- Unknown ---
We were gettin' along!
We had that little dance-y thing!
Well here's a song i sing
My way,
--- Unknown ---
It was gonna be fine.
But you didn't wanna be,
Be the man who'd be with me--
No way.
--- Unknown ---
But now you sayin' it's time--
Why you gotta be like that?
I don't like the way you act
'Round me.
--- Unknown ---
So baby come on, come on...
--- Unknown ---
Oh don't you tell me to go,
And say i'm the one,
D-d-do you think i'm dumb?
Sorry- did i just stutter?
--- Unknown ---
Won't tell you what you know,
But this is the end...
You were never my friend,
You were never my--
You were never my lover!
--- Unknown ---
Remember that night?
When i saw you tremblin' there?
I remember; i don't care--
'Bout you.
--- Unknown ---
I'm rememberin' how
You thought you were at the top,
Well i think we're better off
Without you!
--- Unknown ---
And i got your number--
And i don't mean in my phone;
Would've already just thrown it out,
If i'd known about
The way you'd bitch and moan,
--- Unknown ---
You remember that way--
How you were way outta line?
Well now you're way outta time!
So tell me what you want on your tombstone!
--- Unknown ---
Come on, come on...
--- Unknown ---
Well don't you tell me to go,
And say i'm the one,
S-s-s-sorry sir, we done!
'Scuse me, did i just stutter?
--- Unknown ---
Won't tell you what you know,
But this is the end...
You were never my friend,
You were never my--
You were never my lover!
--- Unknown ---
It's too bad you a loser.
Too bad you waste my time.
Good thing that i'm around
To keep your ass in line!
--- Unknown ---
... You were never my--
You were never my lover!
