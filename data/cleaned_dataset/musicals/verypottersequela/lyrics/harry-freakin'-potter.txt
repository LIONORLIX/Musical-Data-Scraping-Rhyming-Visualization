I never thought i'd be a part of such a fate,
An opportunity eleven years late...
I guess it's time for me step up to the plate
And show 'em that i'm something great!
--- Unknown ---
I'm harry freakin' potter!
I'll do what i can
If what you say i am is true!
--- Unknown ---

By my awful past,
I've found at last
Something i can do,
So it's time i knew
Exactly who i am...
