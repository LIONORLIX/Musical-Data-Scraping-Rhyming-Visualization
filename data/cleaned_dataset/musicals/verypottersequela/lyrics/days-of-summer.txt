------ Days of Summer ------
--- Ron ---
We've got these days of summer to,
Remind us of each other!
--- Hermione ---
The time we have to spend apart,
Will keep us in each other's hearts!
--- Harry ---
I'm hoping that the good old days
Are something i will dream about at night.
--- Draco ---
Don't matter if it's sooner or later,
I know that it's gonna be all right!
--- All ---
I don't wanna see you go,
But it's not forever,
Not forever!
--- Unknown ---
Even if it was you know,
That i would never let it get me down!
--- Unknown ---
'Cause you're the part of me,
That makes me better,
Wherever i go!
--- Unknown ---
So i will try,
Not to cry,
But no one needs to say goodbye!
