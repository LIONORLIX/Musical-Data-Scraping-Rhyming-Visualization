------ To Have a Home ------
--- Unknown ---
Home,
I've heard the word before,
But it never meant much more
Than just a thing i've never had.
--- Unknown ---
A "place,"
They say, hey, know your place!
But i've never had a place to even know,
Or a face that i could go to
If i needed someone there...
--- Unknown ---
I'm laughing
It's hard to hide a smile
My god, it's been a while
Since i have had a reason to.
--- Unknown ---
To think
It's been here all along
Somewhere to belong,
And a reason,
A something-to-believe-in
--- Unknown ---
I've finally found it,
A place where i'm wanted...
This must be how it feels to have a home
--- Unknown ---
I used to dream about it
But never schemed or counted
On fantasies or wishes-
It breaks a man to see what he misses
--- Unknown ---
And so many nights i'd pray
For a better life, a better day
But i never thought that it'd come true
It's finally here and i don't know what to do
And i'm trying not to cry
--- Unknown ---
This must be how it feels
To have a home
--- Unknown ---
I've finally made it
I've hoped and i've waited
And for the first time in my life, i don't feel so
Alone
--- Unknown ---
My heart starts to heal
To know this is real.
This is how it must feel
