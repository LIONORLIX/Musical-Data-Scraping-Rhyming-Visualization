------ Our Finest Dreams ------
--- Jo (spoken) ---
Years from now, people will talk about us.
One Christmas Eve,
four penniless and ragged sisters put on an operatic tragedy for all of Concord!
--- Amy (spoken) ---
All of Concord!
--- Meg, Beth (spoken) ---
Oh, Jo, no!
--- Jo (spoken) ---
Filled with blood and guts!
Two massacres, a masked ball and several heart wrenching scenes.
--- Unknown ---
(sung)
We'll dim the lights,
The crowd will hush.
We'll start the overture
And Beth will surely blush.
And when Clarissa starts to plead,
Christmas will exceed our finest dreams.
--- Meg (spoken) ---
Jo, do I die again in this one?
--- Jo (spoken) ---
Yes!
--- Unknown ---
(sung)
Meg you will die
Like none before.
The world will shudder
When your body hits the floor!
For when Rodrigo makes you bleed,
Christmas will exceed our finest dreams!
--- Unknown ---
Now Amy: as Clarissa
Only passion is permissible.
This tragedy depends upon The fire in your eyes.
And Beth: when you?re the mother,
You'll be noble, you'll be pure.
All hearts will melt the moment mother cries.
--- Unknown ---
(spoken)
Let us begin!
--- Meg (spoken) ---
AHA!
--- Beth ---
--- Amy (spoken) ---
Mother, dear mother, do not cry.
--- Jo (spoken) ---
No, no, no. Amy.  Expression! From the heart. Mother! Oh no, dear Mother! Do not cry!
--- Amy (spoken) ---
Mother. Oh no, dear-
Jo, I am teased and ridiculed at school and all that concerns you is your silly little tragedy.
--- Jo (sung) ---
I know you're tired.
I know it's hard.
But we will triumph when Rodrigo yells ?en garde?!
--- Meg, Beth ---
Touche!
--- Jo ---
Our success is guaranteed!
Christmas will be thrilling;
Christmas will be gory!
Christmas will exceed our finest dreams.
--- Unknown ---
(spoken)
I've made an important decision today.
As you all know I've been writing stories forever, with much satisfaction.
And people seem to like what I write.
--- Beth (spoken) ---
We love it, Jo!
--- Jo (spoken) ---
Absolutely! So I've decided, I?m going to become a world renowned writer.
I shall write great books and earn barrels of money and I will give you all
everything you've ever dreamed of!
--- Meg, Amy (spoken) ---
Oh Jo!
--- Beth (spoken) ---
Jo can do anything!
--- Jo (spoken) ---
But we must promise to remain just as we are. Solid like a fortress.
No matter whatever happens,
we must promise that it will always be the four March sisters- forever.
--- All (spoken) ---
Forever!
--- Jo (spoken) ---
Come, let us rehearse!
--- Unknown ---
(spoken overlapping)
--- Amy ---
?Mother, dear mother, do not cry!?
--- Beth ---
?Not my daughter, you wretch!?
--- Meg ---
?You will have me or no one!?
--- Amy ---
?No one!?
--- Unknown ---
Jo (sung in counterpoint)I?ve got my boots and hat,
My moustache is curled.
I?m making my entrance now, With curtains unfurled!
I'll show them all
I'm no little woman
In a dress all buttoned
And pearled.
I'm ready to take a bow.
I've taken a solemn vow.
With all that I am
Somehow.
--- Meg, Beth, Amy (sung in counterpoint w/Jo) ---
Before we're done,
The crowd will roar.
We'll make their
Spirits soar!
Our success is guaranteed!
Christmas will be thrilling!
Yes, Christmas will exceed
Our finest dreams:
When sweet Clarissa beams,
When brave Rodrigo screams,
When the evil villian's
Glassy eyeball gleams!
--- Jo (spoken) ---
My dearest Mama, there will be Christmas after all!
--- Amy (sung) ---
Christmas!
--- Beth (sung) ---
Christmas!
--- Meg (sung) ---
Christmas!
--- Jo (sung) ---
Christmas!
--- All ---
Will exceed our finest dreams!
