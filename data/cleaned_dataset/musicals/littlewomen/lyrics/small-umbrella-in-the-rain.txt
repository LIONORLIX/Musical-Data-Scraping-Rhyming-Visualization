------ Small Umbrella in the Rain ------

Professor Bhaer
Jo. We are not at all alike. We have our differences. May I be blunt?
--- Unknown ---
Jo
Be blunt. By all means.
--- Unknown ---
Professor Bhaer
I think perhaps it looks like rain
--- Unknown ---
Jo
The sky gets bluer by the hour
--- Unknown ---
Professor Bhaer
The water falls in little drops
--- Unknown ---
Jo
That?s why it?s called a sun shower
--- Unknown ---
Professor Bhaer
Ah, not it stops
--- Unknown ---
Jo
You were about to be blunt?
--- Unknown ---
Professor Bhaer
If I say rain, then you sun.
If I say yes, then you say no.
It seems before we start, we?re done.
We even argue at ?hello?
If I say, share with me
This small umbrella
--- Unknown ---
Jo
I say who cares if we get wet?
--- Unknown ---
Professor Bhaer
We are as different as the
Morning and the night
--- Unknown ---
Jo
No, we?re as different as the
Winter and the spring
--- Unknown ---
Professor Bhaer
We always seem to fight
--- Unknown ---
Jo
We disagree on everything
--- Unknown ---
Professor Bhaer
And yet?
You make me smile,
You make me laugh,
You make me care.
How can I explain?
Inside my heart
I feel a pain
When you?re not there.
Though we?re not at all alike,
You make me feel alive.
If we had that in common,
That one small thing in common,
Love could be like a small umbrella,
In the rain.
When people discover passion,
They?ve come upon something rare.
This fervor they have in common,
Will shelter them anywhere.
Though the rest may be rough,
With such passion to share,
I think we have more than enough-
Enough to make a marriage,
If we dare.
--- Unknown ---
Jo
You are proposing?
--- Unknown ---
Professor Bhaer
No. Yes! Yes! I do not mean today.
Or tomorrow, or even next month.
In a year maybe, two years even.
I am a patient man.
--- Unknown ---
Jo
I won?t be sweet, won?t be demure
--- Unknown ---
Professor Bhaer
This I prefer, this I adore
--- Unknown ---
Jo
I?ll speak my mind, you can be sure
--- Unknown ---
Professor Bhaer
I?ll be enchanted to the core.
--- Unknown ---
Jo
If I say, let me share your
Small umbrella.
--- Unknown ---
Professor Bhaer
I?ll say, who cares if we get wet?
--- Unknown ---
Jo
We?ll be as different as a
Husband and a wife
--- Unknown ---
Professor Bhaer
No, we?ll be as different as a
Woman and a man
--- Unknown ---
Jo
We?ll fight our way through life.
--- Unknown ---
Professor Bhaer
We?ll disagree the best we can.
--- Unknown ---
Jo
And yet?
--- Unknown ---
Jo/Professor Bhaer
You make me smile,
You make me laugh,
You make me care.
How can I explain?
Inside my heart
I feel a pain
When you?re not there.
Though we?re not at all alike,
You make me feel alive.
--- Unknown ---
Jo
Yes, we have that in common
--- Unknown ---
Professor Bhaer
That one small thing in common
--- Unknown ---
Jo/Professor Bhaer
Our love is like a small umbrella
