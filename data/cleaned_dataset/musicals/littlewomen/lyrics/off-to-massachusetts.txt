------ Off to Massachusetts ------
--- Beth ---
If you say 'Come with me off to Massachusetts'
Then to Massachusetts we will go
We will buy dishes there
Maybe even two sets
Buy the finest china
Then we'll dine a while on crepe suzettes...
--- Mr. Laurence ---
Well?  Go on!
--- Beth ---
We will build model boats off in Massachusetts
There in Massachusetts by the bay
Put them together and wait until the glue sets...
--- Mr. Laurence ---
What's the matter now?
--- Beth ---
I dont remember the rest, sir.
--- Mr. Laurence ---
While we wait, we'll polka for the folk along the parapets!
--- Beth ---
Off

To where the shops are sweet
--- Beth & Mr. Laurence ---
We will play minuets off in Massachusetts
Boston, Massachusetts, Beacon Street
--- Beth ---
If you say 'Come with me'
Then to Massachusetts we will go
We will buy dishes there
--- Mr. Laurence ---
If you say come with me off to Massachusetts
Then to Massachusetts we will go
