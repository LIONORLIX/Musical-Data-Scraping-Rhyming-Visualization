--- JO ---
Who is he?
Who is he with his marry me?
With his ring and his marry me,
the nerve, the gall.
--- Unknown ---
This is not,
Not what was meant to be.
How could he ruin it all
With those two words?
--- Unknown ---
I thought I knew him
Thought that he knew me
When did it change?
What did I miss?
--- Unknown ---
A kiss,
When I thought all along,
That we were meant to find frontiers,
How could I be so wrong?
--- Unknown ---
And I need,
How I need my sisters here
If I can't share my dreams
What were they for?
--- Unknown ---
I thought our promise
That we would never change and never part.
I thought together,
We'd amaze the world.
How can I live my dreams or even start when everything has come apart.
--- Unknown ---
I thought home was all I'd ever want
My attic all I'd ever need.
Now nothing feels the way it was before
And I don't know how to proceed.
I only know I'm meant for something more
I've got to know if I can be
Astonishing
--- Unknown ---
There's a life
That I am meant to lead
A life like nothing I have known
I can feel it
And it's far from here
I've got to find it on my own
--- Unknown ---
Even now I feel it's heat upon my skin.
A life of passion that pulls me from within,
A life that I am making to begin.
There must be somewhere I can be
Astonishing
Astonishing
--- Unknown ---
I'll find my way
I'll find it far away
I'll find it in unexpected and unknown
I'll find my life in my own way
Today
--- Unknown ---
Here I go
There's no turning back
My great adventure has begun.
I may be small
But I've got giant plans
To shine as brightly as the sun.
--- Unknown ---
I will blaze until I find my time and place
I will be fearless,
Surrendering modesty and grace
I will not disapear without a trace
I'll shout and start a riot
Be anything but quiet
Christopher Columbus
I'll be Astonishing
Astonishing
Astonishing
