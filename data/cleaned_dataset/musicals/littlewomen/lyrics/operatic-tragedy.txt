Spoken: 'It's a mean and stormy night
The moors are bleak and bloody.
Thunder claps! Lightning Strikes!
The fair Clarissa, her clothes in disarray,
races across the wild coastal heath-'
--- Unknown ---
Now she stops!
Now she runs!
Will she escape?
Will she be caught?
--- Unknown ---
Spoken: With bold determination,
the villainous aristocrat Braxton Prendergast, lurches for her-
--- Unknown ---
There's no escape.
She's but a child.
And yet she turns to fight
With eyes ablaze!
This noble girl meets his gaze,
Unafraid.
She will not be defiled!
