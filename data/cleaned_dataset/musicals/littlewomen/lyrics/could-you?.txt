------ Could You? ------

Aunt March: (spoken)
We earn our dreams in this world Josephine. Ha.
It's foolish of me to think you could ever change your ways.
--- Unknown ---
Jo: (spoken)
I could try.
--- Unknown ---
Aunt March: (spoken)
You could never bend your will, you could never follow through.
You could never bite your tongue, though your tongue may split in two.
If you want to live your dreams, these are things you have to do!
How could you change? You can't. Not you.
--- Unknown ---
Jo: (spoken)
I could change if I wanted to.
--- Unknown ---
Aunt March: (spoken)
could you practice self control? Could you possibly be shy?
Could you wear a corset tight in the heat of mid-July?
These are rules you must obey, every one which you defy! You'll never change!
You won't. That's why.
Yet somewhere deep within my heart I do believe, you could captivate the world.
If you could change there is so much you could achieve.
In time you could succeed and travel very far indeed. You could be beguiling!
--- Unknown ---
Jo: (singing)
charming me?
--- Aunt March ---
someone well mannered, a model of grace. Learn the art of smiling!
--- Jo ---
That could be hard.
--- Aunt March ---
It isn't very hard!! For someone full of dreams like you,
if you work you'll find there's nothing you can't do!
--- Jo ---
So if I change we'll go to Paris?
--- Aunt March ---
Change completely or don't waste my time!
--- Jo ---
If I change we'll stop in Antwerp?
--- Aunt March ---
Gracious living will make you sublime.
--- Jo ---
If I change you'll take me to Zurich?
--- Aunt March ---
Every city from Dublin to Kahn!
--- Jo ---
Surely with your guidance I can learn to use feminine wiles with alarm!
I could be beguiling.
--- Aunt March ---
Ah ah ah
--- Jo ---
Ah ah ah
--- Aunt March ---
Ah ah ah ah
--- Jo ---
I could learn to charm a donkey for a chance to see the world.
Learn the art of smiling!
--- Aunt March ---
Ah ah ah, ah ah ah
--- Both ---
Ah ah ah ah ah!
--- Jo ---
I could button up my mind and keep my thoughts perfumed and burned.
Yes I surely think I could.
--- Aunt March ---
If you could that would be good.
--- Jo ---
There's nothing that I wouldn't suffer to see the world!
I can do it if I try. I can do it by sheer will.
--- Aunt March ---
All you have to do is work to acquire any skill.
--- Both ---
These are things a girl must do when she has dreams she must fulfill!
--- Aunt March ---
Change how you walk and how you talk.
Change how you think and how you are.
--- Jo ---
I'll hold my breath and hold my tongue, do what it takes to travel far!
--- Aunt March ---
Could you?
--- Jo ---
Ah ah ah ah ah
--- Aunt March ---
Could you?
--- Jo ---
Ah ah ah ah ah
--- Aunt March ---
Could you?
--- Jo ---
AH ah ah ahaa ah ah ah ah ahhhhh! Yes I could!
--- Aunt March ---
Good!
