------ Fire Within Me ------
--- Unknown ---
How do I go on?
Just an empty room
All I have are memories
I need a task to do
Someone give me a task to do
I need a....
--- Unknown ---
I thought that somehow we would always have forever
I thought the promises we made would have a different end
I thought the love we shared would keep us as we were
It was the fire within me
--- Unknown ---
We dreamed and plotted with abandon in this attic
When we were gathered here the room became our citadel
We were amazing then my sisters and I
They were the fire within me
--- Unknown ---
In this room I knew we were alive
Nothing was too painful to survive
We faced the world together
The four of us forever side by side
Everything I promised was for them
I was theirs no matter where or when
How can that be lost forever
How when I gave everything with all my heart

[It was several days before Christmas.
It was several days before Christmas.
My sisters sat about the parlor and grumbled about their fate.

Meg, the oldest and most romantic said,
It's not fair some girls have pretty things while we have nothing.
--- Unknown ---
"And it won't be Christmas without presents,"
said Amy with her usual pout.
--- Unknown ---
"And we haven't got father to read to us,"
said Jo who yearned to travel and write great books.
--- Unknown ---
Only Beth, sitting contented said, in a tone so sweet,
even angels would have listened, But we've got each other.]
--- Unknown ---
Everything I promised them is here
All of us we used to be
We will always have each other
They will always be the fire in my heart
Here I go, and there's no turning back
My great adventure has begun
I may be small
But I've got giant plans
To shine as brightly as the sun
Here in all the smallest details of the past
Here in this attic suddenly life is something vast
The four of us forever here at last
As unexpected as can be
