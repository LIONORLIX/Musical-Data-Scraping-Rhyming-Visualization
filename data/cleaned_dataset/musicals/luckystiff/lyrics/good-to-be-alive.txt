Harry: Why am I here? What am I doing?
I'm on a trip with a dead man!
What made me think I could get through this?
Why in the hell did I ever do this?
How in the hell will I ever get by?

O! What's that uncle?
You say your eyesight isn't what it used to be?
Well of course, I'd be happy to describe the sights!

You can see the sun, shining on the sea, Uncle Anthony
What a lovely sea, wouldn't you agree, Uncle Anthony
Here it's very hot so I hope you've got something you can swim in
On the beach we'll lie, gazing at the sky
Uncle you will die! Uh- when you see the women
Everything is French, uncle take a look its all 'tres jolie'
Nothing like you've read, not in any book, Uncle Anthony
It's all so new and thanks to you I doubt that I'll survive
O don't you think it's good to be alive?
