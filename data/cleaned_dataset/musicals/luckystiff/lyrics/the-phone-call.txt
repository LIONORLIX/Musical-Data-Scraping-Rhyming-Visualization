Mary Alice?
Can you hear me?
Listen honey, I'm calling to tell you
There's a problem
Are you sitting?
Well, I won't be home for dinner tonight
You know Nicky?
Rita's husband?
Well I think he is planning to kill me!
--- Unknown ---
Mary Alice
It's not funny
And I won't be home for dinner tonight!
Don't hold the meatloaf
Don't toss the salad
Don't talk to strangers
--- Unknown ---
Call all my patients
Break my appointments
Please, Mary Alice just be calm!
--- Unknown ---
Are you finished?
Are you better?
Mary Alice, you're overreacting!
Honey bunny, are you crying?
--- Unknown ---
It's your birthday?!
Gee, I'm sorry.
Mary Alice, it's only a birthday!
So you're fourty
I'm in danger!
And I can't come home for dinner
--- Unknown ---
So blow out the candles
Open the presents
Please, Mary Alice
I'm in Europe
In an airport
With no wallet, no cards, and no money
With my sister- who is crazy
And who's got me in an awful jam!
--- Unknown ---
So the answer, Mary Alice
Is I won't be home for dinner!
Mary Alice-
Mary Alice?
