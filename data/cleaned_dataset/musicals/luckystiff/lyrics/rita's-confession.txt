------ Rita's Confession ------
--- Unknown ---
Rita: Vinnie, you're my brother.
I'm in a little trouble and I didn't know where else to go
Listen to this obituary I just found in the Atlantic City paper
Vinnie: You're holding it upside-down put on your glasses.
R: Oh! Heh heh... ok 'British shoe salesman inherits 6 million dollars
From casino manager uncle.
V: I don't get it
R: Let me start at the beginning.
--- Unknown ---
I was having an affair
V: an affair?
R: an affair, and my lover's name was Tony
V: Tony?
R: Hamden
He managed my husband's casino, he wore a tux
I went crazy for the guy, which is why
V: which is why...?
R: I embezzled from my husband
V: Not your husband
R: We stole from my husband's casino
Six million bucks!
V: no...
R: and all in rocks!
Six million bucks in diamonds in a heart shaped box
--- Unknown ---
Now I've gotta go to Monte Carlo
I've gotta find this man
He inherited the money
I embezzled from my husband
For my lover, who I accidentally shot
V: What!?!
--- Unknown ---
R: Well I went to Tony's place
V: Tony's place?
R: It was dawn. And I saw a woman leaving
V: woman?
R: Leaving. I knew that my Tony was in there
Well I saw red
And the room was very dark
V: Very dark
R: Very dark and I didn't have my glasses
V: What no glasses?
R: And there in the dark accidentally I shot him dead
They found his will
He left his English nephew my entire six mil.
--- Unknown ---
Now I've got to go to Monte Carlo
I've got to find this man
V: He inherited the money
R: I embezzled from my husband
V: For the guy you accidentally shot at dawn
--- Unknown ---
R: and you've got to go to Monte Carlo
V: Me?
R: Just as fast as you can
V: Why?
R: Cause I accidentally mentioned it was you who took the money
When my husband accidentally found it gone
What could I say?
V: What did you say? What did you say?
R: What could I do?
V: What did you do? What did you do?
R: The money was gone, and Nicky caught on so I blamed it
V: No...
R: On you
I said you lost it gambling... I was desperate.
It just came out of my mouth, you know, spontaneously
And now. Well, I think Nicky has a- a contract on your life
--- Unknown ---
V: I've got to go to Monte Carlo. I've got to find this man
I could end up in the river with a bullet in my liver
Or piano wire wrapped around my neck
R: Check
Both: We've got to go to Monte Carlo just as fast as we can
