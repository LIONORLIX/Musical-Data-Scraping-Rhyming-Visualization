Annabel: I have a toast to make.
It's the first one I've ever made.
--- Unknown ---
As long as its goodbye and knowing this is it,
I have a little something to admit.
--- Unknown ---
It was
Nice fighting you, nice hating you
Nice knowing I was aggravating you.
Amazing, but true. It was
--- Unknown ---
A+H: nice

Harry: You were impossible,
A: Unbearable,
A+H: My nerves were almost
H: un-- A: repairable.
A+H: But now that it's through,
It was nice
--- Unknown ---
A: From now on I'll have no one to ruin my day
H: A view won't be a view without you in my way
--- A+H ---
And no sleepless nights,
No heart attacks,
H: No need to bring along your battleaxe
A+H: No way I would do this twice,
H: but once,
A: just once,
A+H: it was nice
--- Unknown ---
From now on I'll have no one to ruin my day
A view won't be a view without you in my way
--- Unknown ---
So nice knowing you, nice meeting you
Nice knowing there'll be no repeating you
And won't life be paradise,
