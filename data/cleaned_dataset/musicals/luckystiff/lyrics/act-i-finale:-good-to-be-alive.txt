------ Act I Finale: Good To Be Alive ------
--- Man ---
Harry, you?re a winner!
--- Harry ---
It?s my uncle?s infallible system! Thank you, thank you!
--- Annabelle ---
How can you do this?
How can you stand there watching that silly ball spin around
when there are world problems that need solving?
You are the most selfish person I?ve ever met!
--- Harry ---
Now, you listen, for the first time in my life I?m on a bloody winning streak- my luck has changed!
And I?m not about to give up the one and only chance I?ve ever had.
Not to a pack of mangy, flea ridden mongrels, and certainly not to you.
I?m in the world
I?m on the spin
From here on out I know I?ll win
--- Man ---
He?s got the touch
--- Woman ---
He?s got the knack
--- Man 2 ---
He?s betting three
--- All ---
He?s hot on black
If this is it, you must admit
It makes a body cry
Oh-
--- Man ---
Mr. Witherspoon, you?ve won!
--- All ---
It?s good to be
Alive
--- Rita ---
Mr. Witherspoon, you?re dead!
