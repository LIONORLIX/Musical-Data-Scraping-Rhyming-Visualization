------ Shoes ------
--- Unknown ---
some shoes go dancing every night
some shoes go living it up left and right
places with music playing
laughter and noise and wine
hundreds of shoes all swaying
not mine
--- Unknown ---
some shoes take cruises far away
the skies are tropical blue never gray
toes up against the railing
watching the water shine
hundreds of shoes gone sailing
--- Unknown ---
right now they're off exploring
some exotic streams
champagne pouring in the moonlight
now they're dancing feet to feet
--- Unknown ---
i see them tiptoe lightly up a winding stair
slipped off nightly in the darkness
next to someone else's pair
--- Unknown ---
you won't catch my shoes on the town
they're sturdy, sensible things: basic brown
not ones to fly away in
dance or make love or cruise
wish i could spend one day in
