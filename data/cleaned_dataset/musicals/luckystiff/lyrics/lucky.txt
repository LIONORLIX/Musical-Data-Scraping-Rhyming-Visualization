HARRY (spoken)
Well, I suppose there are two ways to look at this.
I mean, true, I am here in a foreign country with a dead man in a wheel chair,
trying to pretend that nothing is wrong and having to do all sorts of things I
don't even want to think about.
On the other hand, this is a chance to earn a great deal of money in a very short time.
So for once in my life, I should think positive.
I will!
Think positive!

HARRY(sung)
Everything is fine
Everything is a-okay
I suppose that one might say
I'm lucky
Oh god-
Look at where I am
Think of how I made it through
All of this and all so new
I'm lucky
--- Unknown ---
With you in my life
We'll both find out how living feels
With you in my life my life will be
A hell on wheels
--- Unknown ---
Now my fate is in your hands
And my future's on the line
Glad to know that you're so sure
I'll be fine
But I'll need a lot of luck
Start with luck like mine

HARRY(spoken)
Well, what have you got to say for yourself, uncle?

UNCLE ANTHONY(spoken, recording)
I wanna go gambling one last time!
I wanna go scuba diving!
I wanna feel the wind in my hair, and the sun in my face!
Well, as best I can.
--- Unknown ---
HARRY(sung)
With you by my side
There's nothing we won't see or do
With you by my side I'm unafraid
Are you?
*pause*
--- Unknown ---
Well, no matter what's in store
What can someone do but try?
And if anyone should ask I'll reply-
You're one lucky stiff *laugh*
And so am I!

UNCLE ANTHONY(spoken, recording)
Have I got a red rose in my buttonhole?
--- Unknown ---
HARRY(spoken)
Check!
--- Unknown ---
UNCLE ANTHONY(spoken, recording)
Sunglasses?
--- Unknown ---
HARRY(spoken)
Check!

UNCLE ANTHONY(spoken, recording)
Then we're off!
And Harry, I wanna thank you again. I am about to have the biggest adventure of my life!

HARRY(sung)
And so am I
