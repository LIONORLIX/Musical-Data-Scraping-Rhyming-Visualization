All I have to say is
I am happy to be sitting here
Doing what is meaningful to me
--- Unknown ---
Working on behalf
of the universal dog home
Not barking up a stranger's tree

That melts you with a grin
The kind of eyes that welcome you
The minute you walk in
A tender glance
You simply can't refuse

by chewing up the news
--- Unknown ---
It's things like that
That make you chose...a dog

Well I'm not one

--- Unknown ---
Give me...a quiet night
A stack of books
A tuna melt on rye
A simple walk together
Underneath the starry sky
--- Unknown ---
And, suddenly,
the night is something grand
And all because
There's someone special there
--- Unknown ---
Who's gazing at the view
His head upon...your shoes
--- Unknown ---
At times like this
I sure could use....
