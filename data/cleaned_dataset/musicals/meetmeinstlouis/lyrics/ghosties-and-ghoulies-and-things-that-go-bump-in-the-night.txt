------ Ghosties and Ghoulies and Things That Go Bump in the Night ------
--- KATIE ---
No Hallowe’en is for children.
--- TOOTIE ---
What do you mean?
--- KATIE ---
Well, with your imaginations, you can see things we grown folk can not.
--- TOOTIE & AGNES ---
Why?
--- KATIE ---
Because you little ones are closer to God…
--- Heavenly sting. ---
And the devil.
--- Terror sting segues into the song. ---
FROM GHOSTIES AND GHOULIES
AND THINGS THAT BUMP IN THE NIGHT
DEAR LORD, PLEASE PROTECT THEM!
FROM GOBLINS AND GORGONS
THAT PUT LITTLE GIRLS IN A FRIGHT
PLEASE DRAW YOUR SWORD
AND PROTET THEM
THERE’S A CHILL IN THE NIGHT
AND A CHILL IN OUR HEARTS
WHEN I THINK OF WHAT DEMONS
MIGHT LURK IN THESE PARTS
--- Unknown ---
SO, DEAR LORD, PLEASE PROTECT THEM!
FROM TERRIBLE THINGS THAT GO KLUMP!
HORRIBLE THINGS THAT GO THUMP!
HIDEOUS THINGS THAT GO BUMP!
IN THE NIGHT!
--- TOOTIE ---
FROM GHOSTIE AND GHOULIES
AND THINGS THAT BUMP IN THE NIGHT
DEAR LORD, PLEASE PROTECT ME!
FROM GOBLINS AND GORGONS
THAT PUT LITTLE GIRLS IN A FRIGHT
PLEASE DRAW YOUR SWORD
AND PROTET ME
THERE’S A FIEND OR A WITCH
--- Unknown ---
I’D REALLY KNOW WHICH
WHO IS WAITING TO DRAG ME
RIGHT INTO THE DITCH
--- Unknown ---
SO, DEAR LORD, PLEASE PROTECT ME!
--- Unknown ---
AHHH!
--- Unknown ---
FROM TERRIBLE THINGS THAT GO BAM!
HORRIBLE THINGS THAT GO SLAM!
HIDEOUS THINGS THAT GO WHAM!

[TOOTIE is chased (and entertained)
through a world of her worst visual nightmare in
a modern dance extravaganza involving
the ENSEMBLE dressed up as all of the fiendish creatures
described in the song lyrics.
Twisiting every day life into a childish nightmare.
- A group of scary fighting trees with eyes
- A group of PUMPKINHEADS who can remove their heads
- A group of SKELETONS
- several of TOOTIE’s dead dolls.
AH! My dead dolls!
--- The last to emerge, is probably the most famous, BRIDGET ROCKEFELLER. ---
Bridget Rockefeller!
--- Unknown ---
[TOOTIE
tries to escape and runs through the graveyard to the doorway of MR. BRAUKOFF.
She knocks three times to escape the banshees.
No answer. She knocks again.]
--- MR. BRAUKOFF ---
Well?
--- TOOTIE ---
I--I hate you, Mr. Braukoff.
