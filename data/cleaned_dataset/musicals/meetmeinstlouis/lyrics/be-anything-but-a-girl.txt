------ Be Anything But a Girl ------
--- GRANDPA ---
WHEN I WAS A BOY, I MUST CONFESS
I SECRETLY ENVIED GIRLS.
THEY WERE TREATED WITH RESPECT AND LOVE
BY A VELVET HAND AND VELVET GLOVE
WITH NEVER A SINGLE CHORE
WHILE BOYS HAD TO WORK,
AND THEN WORK SOME MORE
--- AGNES ---
WELL, I’M JUST THE OTHER WAY ROUND,
I GUESS
I’VE ALWAYS ENVIED BOYS!
I WISH I COULD HAVE THEIR CAREFREE WAYS
AROUND THE WORLD IN EIGHTY DAYS
BOYS CAN LEARN, AND GROW, AND FIND THEIR PLACE
AND FEEL LIKE A PART OF THE HUMAN RACE!
--- GRANDPA ---
IF REINCARNATION PERRMITTED YOUR LIFE
TO UNFURL AGAIN
I HOPE YOU DON’T HAVE TO COME BACK,
JUST TO BE A GIRL AGAIN
--- Unknown ---
I hope so too, Grandpa.
--- GRANDPA ---

BUZZIN’ THROUGH THE HOURS

BE A HUMMIN’BIRD OUT TO SPREE

--- AGNES ---
BUT A GIRL
