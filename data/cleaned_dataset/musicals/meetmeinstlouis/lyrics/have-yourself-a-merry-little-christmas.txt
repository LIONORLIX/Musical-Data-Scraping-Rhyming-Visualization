------ Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas ------
--- Esther ---
Have yourself a merry little Christmas.
Let your heart be light.
Next year all our troubles
Will be out of sight.
Have yourself a merry little Christmas.
Make the Yule-tide gay.
From now on our troubles
Will be miles away.
--- Unknown ---
Here we are as in olden days,
Happy golden days of yore.
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Will be near to us once more.
--- Unknown ---
Someday soon we all will be together
If the Fates allow.
Until then we'll have to muddle through somehow.
