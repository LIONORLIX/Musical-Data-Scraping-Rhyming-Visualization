------ The Boy Next Door ------
--- Esther ---
the moment i saw him smile
i knew he was just my style
my only regret is we've never met
though i dream of him all the while
but he doesn't know i exist
no matter how i may persist
so it's clear to see
there's no hope for me
though i live at 5135 kensington avenue
and he lives at 5133
--- Unknown ---
how can i ignore
the boy next door?
i love him more than i can say
doesn't try to please me
doesn't even tease me
and he never sees me
glance his way
and though i'm heartsore
the boy next door
affection for me won't display
i just adore him
so i can't ignore him
the boy next door
i just adore him
so i can't ignore him
