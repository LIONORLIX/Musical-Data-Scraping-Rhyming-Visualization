------ Touch of the Irish ------
--- KATIE ---
AN IRISHMAN IS A FUNNY GUY,
SOMETIMES LOW AND SOMETIMES HIGH,
DECEPTIVE AND EVASIVE,
POETIC AND PERSUASIVE.
--- Unknown ---
THE LASSIES HAVE THE SELF-SAME KNACK,
SO THEY NEVER HAVE A LACK
OF GENTLEMAN HANGIN? AROUND--
AT LEAST, THAT'S WHAT I'VE FOUND.
--- THEY CHARM HIM, DISARM HIM ---
WITH EV?RY FEMININE WILE,
AND STEAL THEM FROM THEIR SISTERS
WITH BRAZEN IRISH GUILE.
--- ESTHER / ROSE ---
IT SOUNDS AS IF,
WHEN IT COMES TO ROMANCE,
A COUPLE OF SMITHS
WOULDN'T STAND A CHANCE.
--- ROSE ---
WE OUGHT TO BE CASEY OR MULLIGAN!
--- ESTHER ---
O'SULLIVAN OR McCULLIGAN!
--- KATIE ---
OH NO, THAT ISN'T TRUE.
THERE ARE JUST A FEW
SIMPLE THINGS YOU OUGHT TO DO . . .
--- IF THE LAD IS SLOW TO SPEAK AND QUICK TO RUN AWAY, ---
IF HIS WALLET'S EMPTY WHEN THEY GIVE ?IM A BILL TO PAY,
IF HE STARTS TO PANIC WHEN YOU MENTION ?WEDDING DAY,?
GIVE ?IM A TOUCH OF THE BLARNEY,
HIS FEET WILL LEAVE THE GROUND
GIVE ?IM A TOUCH OF THE SHAMROCK
AN? WATCH HIM COME AROUND.
--- Unknown ---
IF HE SAYS YOU'RE LUCKY KNOWIN?
SUCH A HANDSOME GENT,
TELL HIM THAT YOU'RE TIRED OF HIM,
YOU'VE GIVEN HIM UP FOR LENT.
DO A BIT OF FLIRTIN?
JUS? TO THROW IF OFF THE SCENT--
GIVE ?IM A TOUCH OF THE BLARNEY
AND SET YOUR LITTLE TRAP,
GIVE ?IM A TOUCH OF THE SHAMROCK?
HE'LL FALL INTO YOUR LAP!
--- Four bars of ?Irish pipes? ---
--- THEN PRAISE HIM, ---
GENTLY DAZE HIM,
SIMPLY AMAZE HIM
WITH COMPLIMENTS
THAT MAKE NO SENSE.
--- Unknown ---
IF HE TELLS YOU YOU'RE THE SWEETEST
LASS HE'S EVER KNOWN,
MAKE SURE THAT THE TWO OF YOU
WILL NEVER BE LEFT ALONE;
WHISTLE THROUGH YOUR TEETH
AND HOLLER FOR THE CHAPERONE,
GIVE ?IM A TOUCH OF SHILLELAGH,
IMPLORE YOU THOUGH HE MAY,
GIVE ?IM A TOUCH OF THE IRISH
AN? YOU WILL WIN THE DAY.
--- Unknown ---
TELL ?IM HE'S WONDERFUL,
TELL ?IM HE'S MARVELOUS,
TELL ?IM HE'S CLEVER AND WISE;
--- Unknown ---
TELL ?IM YOU'RE CAPTURED,
BEWITCHED AND ENRAPTURED
WHENEVER YOU LOOK IN HIS EYES.
--- Unknown ---
IF THAT DOESN'T GET ?IM,
COMPLETELY UPSET ?IM
NO MATTER HOW LOVELY YOU LOOK, WHY,
TELL HIM YOU KNOW HOW TO COOK!
--- AND IF ALL ELSE FAILS ---
AND HE TAKES THE WIND RIGHT OUT OF YOUR SAILS,
LEAD ?IM TO ROMANCE
WITH A GENUINE IRISH DANCE.
--- Unknown ---
[KATIE leads ESTHER and ROSE through a 27-measure Irish jig,
an Irish reel, an Irish Hornpipe, and anything else she can
remember from her childhood in Donegal.]
--- KATIE ---
GIVE HIM A TOUCH OF THE BLARNEY,
--- KATIE / ESTHER / ROSE ---
AND A TOUCH OF KILLARNEY,
GIVE HIM A TOUCH OF THE IRISH . . .
--- The last syllable of ?Irish? is in close harmony and held for several bars. ---
--- Unknown ---
IT ALWAYS WINS THE DAY!
--- KATIE ---
HEY!
