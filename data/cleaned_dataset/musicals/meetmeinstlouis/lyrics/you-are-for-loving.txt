------ You Are for Loving ------
--- JOHN ---
WHEN WE MET, THE SPRING WAS NEARLY SUMMER--
THE LILACS WERE IN BLOSSOM, I RECALL.
LATER ON, WITH SUMMER NEARLY AUTUMN,
I KNEW I'D FALLEN LONG BEFORE THE FALL.
--- AUTUMN HAS TURNED INTO WINTER, ---
SO SPRING CAN'T BE VERY FAR AWAY,
AND I HAVE LEARNED A HEAD CAN BE TURNED
IN A YEAR, IN A MONTH, IN A DAY
--- SONGS ARE FOR SINGING, ---
BOUQUETS ARE FOR BRINGING,
HOPES ARE FOR CLINGING TO,
WHEELS OF FORTUNE ARE FOR SPINNING,
AND GAMES ARE FOR WINNING.
--- TUNES ARE FOR HUMMING, ---
GUITARS ARE FOR STRUMMING,
DREAMS ARE FOR COMING TRUE,
AND YOU ARE FOR LOVING
AND LOVING, AND LOVING, AND LOVING
BY SOMEONE JUST AS WONDERFUL AS YOU,
WHICH MAKES ME WONDER IF I'LL DO.

--- TUNES ARE FOR HUMMING, ---
GUITARS ARE FOR STRUMMING,
DREAMS ARE FOR COMING TRUE,
AND YOU ARE FOR LOVING,
AND LOVING AND LOVING AND LOVING
BY SOMEONE JUST AS WONDERFUL
AS YOU;
--- BUT WHEN WE STAND ---
HAND IN HAND
--- In counterpoint ---
--- ESTHER ---
IN YOUR VOICE,
THERE'S A CLEARNESS,
IN YOUR TOUCH,
THERE'S A NEARNESS,
IN YOUR EYES,
THERE'S A STAR OR TWO
IN YOUR FACE,
A KIND OF GRACE
AND WHEN YOU'RE GRINNING,
YOU'RE WINNING.
--- EVEN WHEN YOU ARE DISTANT ---
YOUR APPEAL IS INSISTENT
ARE YOU REAL?
ARE YOU TRULY TRUE?
YOU ARE FOR LOVING
AND LOVING AND LOVING
AND LOVING
BY SOMEONE JUST AS WONDERFUL
AS YOU;
--- BUT WHEN WE STAND ---
HAND IN HAND
--- BOTH ---
