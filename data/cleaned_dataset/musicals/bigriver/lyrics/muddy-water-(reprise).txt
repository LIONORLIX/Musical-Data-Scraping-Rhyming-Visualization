------ Muddy Water (Reprise) ------
--- Unknown ---
Well, I been down to the pain and sorrow
Of no tomorrows comin' in
But I put my pole to the river bottom
And I've got to hide some place and find myself again
--- Unknown ---
So, look out for me, oh muddy water
Your mysteries are deep and wide
And I got a need for going some place
