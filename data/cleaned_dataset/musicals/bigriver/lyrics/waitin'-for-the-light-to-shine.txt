------ Waitin' for the Light to Shine ------
--- Unknown ---
(spoken) All right, I'll go to hell!
And I'll take up wickedness again, which is my line, bein' brought up to it. For a starter, I'll steal Jim out of slavery again. And, If I can think of somethin' worse, I'll do that too! Cuz as long as I'm in, and in for good, I might as well go whole hog!
--- Unknown ---
I have lived an undirected life
a cloudy way I know
the only way I knew
So the things I've done
In fact each and every one
Are the way that I was taught to run.
--- Unknown ---
Chorus
I am waiting for the light to shine
I'm waiting for the light to shine
have lived in the darkness for so long
I am waitin' for the light to shine
--- Unknown ---
Far beyond horizons I have seen
Beyond the things I've been
Beyond the dreams I've dreamed
Are the things I've done
In fact each and every one
Are the way that I was taught to run
--- Chorus ---
I am waitin' for the light to shine
I am waitin' for the light to shine
I have lived in the darkness for so long
