------ Hand for the Hog ------
--- Unknown ---
Well, I always heard but I ain't too sure
That a man's best friend is a mangy cur
I kinda favor the hog myself
How about a hand for the hog
--- Unknown ---
Ya say, a hog ain't nothin' but a porky thing
Little forked feet with a nosey ring
Pickle them feel folks
How about a hand for the hog
--- Unknown ---
If you took a notion I'll bet
A good hog would moke a hell of a pet
You could teach him to ride and hunt
You could clean him up and let him sit up front
--- Unknown ---
In the scheme of things the way things go
You might get bit by the old Fido
But not by the gentle, porker friend.
How about a hand for the hog

A feller and a hog had a comedy act
The feller was terrible as a matter of fact
That hog was o funny sucker though
How about a hand for the hog
--- Unknown ---
If you took a notion
I'll bet you could teach a hog to smoke a cigarette
Well, it might take a little bit of time
But hell, what's time to a hog
--- Unknown ---
Well, the way I see it, it looks like this
Either you ain't or either you is
A true blue lover of the swine, folks
