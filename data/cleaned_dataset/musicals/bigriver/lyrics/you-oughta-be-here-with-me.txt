------ You Oughta Be Here With Me ------
--- Unknown ---
If you think it's lonesome where you are tonight
Then you oughta be here with me
If you think there's heartaches where you are tonight
Then you oughta be here with me
--- CHORUS ---
Because with you I'm whole, without you I'm cold
So if you think about me where you are tonight
Then you oughta be here with me
--- Unknown ---
If teardrops are falling where you are tonight
Then you oughta be here with me
Loneliness calling where you are tonight
Then you oughta be here with me
--- CHORUS ---
Because with you I'm whole, without you I'm cold
So if you think about me where you are tonight
