------ When the Sun Goes Down in the South ------
--- Unknown ---
When the sun goes down in the south
And the moon comes up in the East
Step right up and see the wonder of the ages
It's guaranteed visual feast
--- CHORUS ---
When the darkness falls on the town
And the North Star's startin' to rise
Well, you can't imagine the menagerie aire
Created by a couple of guys
--- Unknown ---
Well, anybody wonderin' what they're going to see
Gonna have to ante up a dollar for the ticket
Anybody wonderin' who's goin' on
Is gonna find out when they chase us through the thicket
--- Unknown ---
(REPEAT CHORUS)
--- Unknown ---
When the sun goes down in the South
And the hayseeds stand in line
Well, step right up and see the duo bodily do
The do wah ditty on the clothesline
--- Unknown ---
(REPEAT CHORUS)
--- Unknown ---
When the darkness falls on the town
And the North Star's startin' to rise
Oh, you can't imagine the menagerie aire
Created by a couple of guys
--- Unknown ---
(REPEAT 1ST VERSE AND CHORUS)
--- Unknown ---
Well anybody wonderin' what they' re going to see
Gonna have to ante up a dollar for the ticket
Anybody wonderin' who's goin' on
They're gonna find out when they're chasin' us through the thicket
--- Unknown ---
When the sun goes down in the South
And the North Star's startin' to rise
Oh, you can't imagine the menagerie aire
Created by a couple of guys
