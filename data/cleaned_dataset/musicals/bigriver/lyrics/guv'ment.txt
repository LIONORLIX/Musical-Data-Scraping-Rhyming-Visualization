Well, you dad gum guv'ment
You sorry so and so's
You got your damn hands in every pocket
Of my clothes
--- Unknown ---
Well you dad gum, dad gum, dad gum, guv'ment
Oh, don't I you know
Oh, don't you love 'em sometimes
--- Unknown ---
You dad gum guv'ment
You better pay attention
You're sittin' up there like a fool's convention
Well, you dad gum, dad gum, dad gum guv'ment
Oh don't you know
Oh don't you love 'em sometimes
--- Unknown ---
Well, you soul sellin' no good
Sons-of-a dead pan shoe fittin' fire starters
I ought to tear your no good God dang
Preambulatory bone frame
And nail it to your guv'ment walls
All of you, you, bastards
--- Unknown ---
You dad gum guv'ment
You sorry rakafratchits
You got yourself an itch
And you want me to scratch it
Well, you dad gum, dad gum, dad gum guv'ment
Oh, don t you know
Oh don't you love 'em sometimes
--- Unknown ---
You dad gum guv'ment
You sorry sons-of-bitches
You got your damn hands in every pocket of my britches
Well, you dad gum, dad gum, dad gum guv'ment
