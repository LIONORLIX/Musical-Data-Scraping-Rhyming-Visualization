------ How Blest We Are ------
--- Unknown ---
How blest we are
As children of a God so good and true
To understand his moving hand
And, love for me and you
How blest we are
As children of a God
Whose love is real
Enough to touch each one of us
Is part of him I feel
I honor thee
I honor thee
To whom my love is vowed
How blessed be
