------ Waitin' for the Light to Shine (Reprise) ------
--- Unknown ---
Well, I have lived on undirected life
A cloudy way I know, the only way I knew
And so the thing I've done
In fact each and every one
Is the way that I was taught to run
--- Unknown ---
I am waitin' for the light to shine
I am waitin' for the light to shine
I have lived in the darkness for so long
I'm waitin' for the light to shine
--- Unknown ---
Far beyond horizons I have seen
Beyond things I've been
Beyond the dreams I've dreamed
Are the things I've done
In fact each and every one
Are the way that I was taught to run
--- Unknown ---
I am waitin' for the light to shine
I am waitin' for the light to shine
I have lived in the darkness for so long
I'm waitin' for the light to shine
--- Unknown ---
I am waitin' for the light to shine
I am waitin' for the light to shine
I have lived in the darkness for so long
