------ River in the Rain ------
--- CHORUS ---
River in the rain
Sometimes at night you look like a long white train
Winding your way away somewhere
River I love you don't you care
--- Unknown ---
If you're on the run winding some place
Just trying to find the sun
Whether the sunshine, whether the rain
River I love you just the same
--- Unknown ---
But sometimes in a time of trouble
When you're out of hand
And your muddy bubbles roll across my floor
Carryin' away the things I treasure
Hell, there ain't no way to measure
Why I love you more than I did the day before
--- Unknown ---
River in the rain
Sometimes at night you look like a long white train
Winding your way away somewhere
River I love you, don't you care
--- Unknown ---
But sometimes in a time of trouble
When you're out of hand
And your muddy bubbles roll across my floor
Carryin' away the things I treasure
Hell, there ain't no way to measure
Why I love you more than I did the day before
--- Unknown ---
River in the rain
Sometimes at night you look like a long white train
Winding your way away from me
