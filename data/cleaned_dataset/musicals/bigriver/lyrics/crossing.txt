------ Crossing ------
--- Unknown ---
Crossing to the other side
We are pilgrims
On a journey through the darkness of the night
We are bound for other places
Crossing to the other side
I will worry 'bout tomorrow
When tomorrow comes in sight
Until then, Lord, I'm just a pilgrim
Crossing to the other side
Jesus will be there to meet me
He will reach his hand in mine
I will no more be a stranger
