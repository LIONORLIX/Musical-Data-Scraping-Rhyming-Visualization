------ Boys ------
--- Unknown ---
If the bunch of us all stick together
And we all go down as one
We could be highway robbers
We could be killers just out to have fun
--- Unknown ---
And if any of you can't keep a secret
We'll cut your throat if you tell
Then lay down 'neath six feet of ground
'Cause we were born to raise hell
Chorus:
All together now were the boys
All together forever and always
All together now we are the boys
We're together forever and always
--- Unknown ---
If the bunch of us all, now listen,
'Cause here's the part I like the best
--- Unknown ---
If we all got a hold of some horses
We could ride like the boys out West
We could hoot shoot, and we could holler
We could ride like the devil wind
Then go back to the cave and sleep all day
And do it the next night again
--- Unknown ---
(Repeat Chorus)
--- Unknown ---
If the bunch of us all stick together
And we all go down as one
We could be highway robbers
We could be killers just out to have fun
--- Unknown ---
And if the bunch of us all form a circle
And surround all the ladies of the town
I said hey, hey hey we'll take them to the cave
And dance them till they all fall down
