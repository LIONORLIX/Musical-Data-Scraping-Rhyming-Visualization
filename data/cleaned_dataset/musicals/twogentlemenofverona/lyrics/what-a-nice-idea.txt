------ What A Nice Idea ------
--- Unknown ---
Julia
Because he loves her
He despises me
Because i love him
I pity him
--- Unknown ---
If i could be her
Just for a moment
When he was holding her
I would insult him
Then he’d be unhappy
And not know where to run
--- Unknown ---
I could turn back into me
And i would comfort him
What a nice idea
What a sweet idea
But easier said than done.
--- Unknown ---
Wait!
--- Unknown ---
Julia (cont’d)
If i could be him
Just for a moment
I’d hold her so close
And yell insults at her
She’d never speak to him again
--- Unknown ---
I could turn back into me
And i would comfort him
It ends up the same
Either way
--- Unknown ---
All i want to do
Is have someone scold him
Then i’d come on the scene
And gladly hold him
That’s my idea of fun
Chorus
Que bonita idea dit dit dit dit dit di-ah
Que idea mas linda (repeat background
Que idea mas dulce rhythm under solo)
Que idea ams rica
What a nice idea
What a sweet idea
But easier said than done
But easier said than done easier said than done.

(proteus enters from right and
Whistles on the ensemble who enter
All vocalizing and bearing presents
For silvia. Innkeeper follows proteus)

Proteus
Cut! Cut!
--- Unknown ---
Innkeeper
What a terrible noise.

(proteus blows pitch-pipe then
Conducts ensemble)
