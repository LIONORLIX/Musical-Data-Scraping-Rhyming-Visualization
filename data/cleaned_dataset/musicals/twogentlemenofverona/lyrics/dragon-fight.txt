------ Dragon Fight ------
--- Unknown ---
(A chinese dragon enters down right
With lighted eyes and fire and smoke
From its mouth. Eglamour crosses
Down center and leads the assault.
The dragon circles the tent as
Proteus & valentine defend themselves
With swords. Then the dragon turns
On eglamour and chases him off)
--- Unknown ---
Proteus
Forgive me, valentine: if hearty sorrow
Be sufficient ransom for offense,
I tender ‘t here; i do as truly suffer
As e’er i did commit.
--- Unknown ---
Valentine
Then i am paid;
And once again i do not receive thee honest.
Who by repentance is not satisfied
Is nor of heaven nor earth, for these are pleased.
--- Unknown ---
(julia still in disguise enters)
--- By penitence the eternal’s wrath’s appeased ---
And, that my love may appear plain and free,
All that was mine in silvia i give thee.
--- Unknown ---
Proteus
O, thank you.
(proteus crosses to tent.
Julia swoons)
--- Unknown ---
Julia
O me unhappy!
--- Unknown ---
Valentine
Look to the boy.
--- Unknown ---
(launce, lucetta, speed enter down
Left. Silvia comes out of the tent)
--- Unknown ---
Proteus
Why, boy! Why, wag! What’s the matter.
(proteus sees the ring he has
Given to julia)
Why this is the ring i gave to julia
But how camest thou by this ring’ At my depart
I gave this unto julia.
--- Unknown ---
Julia
Julia herself did give it me;
And julia herself hath brought it hither
--- Unknown ---
(julia pulls off her cap. Her
Hair tumbles down)
--- Unknown ---
Proteus
Julia! And pregnant too.
--- Unknown ---
(he sees she is pregnant. He
Feigns innocence)
