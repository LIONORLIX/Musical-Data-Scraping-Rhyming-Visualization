Out a huge string of pearls from
His shoulder bag and puts them
Around julia’s neck. She takes
Proteus’ hand and leads him down
Left, lies on the floor, fixes
The pearls and offers herself to
Him. Proteus takes off his glasses
And looks to the heavens)

(they embrace on the floor as
Music begins and launce enters up
Right to get the luggage. Launce
Sees them, does a take, then
Crosses over to them)
