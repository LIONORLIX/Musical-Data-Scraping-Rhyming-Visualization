------ Mansion ------
--- Unknown ---
You live in the mansion
I call my heart
I keep beneath my doublet
You live there on a permanent lease!
Nothing like a sub-let
--- Unknown ---
You’ve got to move in
You never can let
The property get run down
The thought of you
Moved in this morning
I want you here by sundown
--- Unknown ---
You’ve rent my heart
Now you control it
If this is rent control
Then i extol it
--- Unknown ---
You live in the mansion
I call my heart
I keep beaneath my doublet
You live there on a permanent lease
Nothing like a sub-let
--- Unknown ---
Everybody needs a home
Here is your vacancy
You already are my love
Come live with me
Silvia, silvia
--- Unknown ---
You live in the mansion
I call my heart
I keep beneath my doublet
You live there on a permanent lease
Nothing like a sub-let
Nothing like a sub-let
Nothing like a sub-let
