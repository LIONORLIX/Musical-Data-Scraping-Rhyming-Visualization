------ Love's Revenge ------
--- Unknown ---
Valentine
No appetite
Love took it away
To show me how starved i was
Love’s revenge
--- Unknown ---
Insomnia
Love gave it to me
To show me i didn’t dream
Love’s revenge
--- Unknown ---
The little i sleep
Is just for a nightmare
The little i eat
Is to taste the dregs
Where is my reason’
What is my name’
What is this terrible shake in my legs’
--- Unknown ---
My future plans
Love took them away
To show me i had no future
Love’s revenge
--- Unknown ---
Valentine (cont’d)
I have no future
I have no past
Without love
Nothing can last
--- Unknown ---
Without love
Nothing can last
That’s love
That’s love’s revenge
