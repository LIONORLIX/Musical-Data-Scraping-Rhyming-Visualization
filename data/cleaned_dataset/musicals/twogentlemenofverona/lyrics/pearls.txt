------ Pearls ------
--- Unknown ---
Launce
I leaned down to kiss you
And your pearls got in my mouth
Your pearls got in my mouth
So i brushed back the pearls
And kissed your mouth
--- Unknown ---
I leaned down to love you
And your pearls caught on the sheet,
Your pearls caught on the sheet
So i took off the pearls
And put ‘em in the ashtray
--- Unknown ---
Then you said that you loved me
You said you loved me
And nothing got in the way
--- Unknown ---
Launce
You didn’t choke
You didn’t joke
You just said you loved me
And the pearls came out of your mouth
The pearls came out of your mouth
And made a necklace fit
For the emperor of milan
