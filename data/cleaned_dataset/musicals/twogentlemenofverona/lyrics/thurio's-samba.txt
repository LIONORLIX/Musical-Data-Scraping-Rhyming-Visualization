Duke
She said
His lets bestride the ocean; his reared arm
Crested the world. His voice was propertied
As all the tuned spheres, and that to friends
But when he meant to quail and shake the orb
He was as rattling thunder. For his bounty,
There was no winter in’t. An autumn ‘twas
That grew the more by reaping. His delights
Were dolphin like: they showed his back above
The element they liv’d in. In his livery
Walked crowns and crowntes; reals and island
Were as coins dropped from his pocket
