Valentine & speed
Milan we finally got here
Where’s fame’
How do i apply’
Where’s fortune’
And how do i get it’
The noise
The size
I can’t believe my eyes
--- Unknown ---
(all dance as the duke, silvia, his
Beautiful daughter, and thurio enter
Up center and cross down center. The
Ensemble falls to the floor)
--- Unknown ---
Duke
The duke
I am the boss here
Silvia
This is my little girl
This is thurio
He’s gonna wed her
Don’t miss the boat
Go dance me up some votes
--- Unknown ---
(silvia & thurio begin to waltz
Because that’s the kind of jerk
He is. A dancer cuts in and we
Have a lively dance with silvia
And male ensemble dancers)
--- Unknown ---
Ensemble
Here’s north
Forget the compass
It’s noon
I know the time
I’m here
Call me fortune’s pet
Milan
I’ll lick you yet
--- Unknown ---
(silvia ends her dance. Thurio
Crosses to her, but she’s no dummy
And she snubs him.
--- Unknown ---
The duke appears at the top of the
Stage. Everyone cheers him)
