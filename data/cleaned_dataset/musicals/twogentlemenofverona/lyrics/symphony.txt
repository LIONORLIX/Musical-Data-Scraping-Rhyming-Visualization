--- Unknown ---
Proteus
I’m planning to write a symphony do you mind
If i dedicate this symphony to you’
I’m planning to write a very great book do you mind
If the heroine is very much like you’
Would you mind if i made you immortal’
I naturally ask your permission
I wouldn’t want to make you immortal
Unless you agree to this condition

One girl
Oh, please agree!

Proteus & ensemble
I won’t write a symphony for you
I won’t carve you in stone
If you will not love me forever
Love me forever
Then i will leave you alone.
