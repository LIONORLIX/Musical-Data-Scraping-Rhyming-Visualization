------ Thou Julia, Thou Has Metamorphosed Me ------
--- Unknown ---
Proteus (cont’d)
Thou, julia, thou hast metamorphosed me.
--- Unknown ---
Made me neglect my studies, love my time
War with good counsel, set the world at naught;
Made with good musing, weak, hart sick with thought
Pro-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-te-us.
--- Unknown ---
(proteus signs his name with a
Flourish. Julia and lucetta enter,
Carrying rakes and hoes and burlap
Bales. They stop when they see
Proteus. Proteus is terrified at
Their proximity. He tries to
Speak. He runs off)
