------ Hot Lover ------
--- Unknown ---
Launce & speed
Young folks spend their time lovin’
Rich folks can afford lovin’
I’ve been
A dog catcher, bartender, log roller, truck driver
But not lover
I want to be a hot lover,
A hot, hot lover
Like the kids in the play
--- Unknown ---
Launce
Oh i’ve had lovin’
Oh god ‘- the pain
To be rejected by a poodle
Then by a great dane ‘- oh -- oh ‘- oh
--- Unknown ---
Launce & speed
Oh
Old folks take their time lovin
Poor folks can’t afford lovin’
I’ve been
Hair cutter, house painter, meat chopper, road runner
But not lover
--- Unknown ---
Launce & speed (cont’d)
I want to be a hot lover
A hot, hot lover
Like the kids in the play
