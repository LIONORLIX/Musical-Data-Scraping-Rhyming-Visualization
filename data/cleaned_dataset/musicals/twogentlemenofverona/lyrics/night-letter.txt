Night letter
So divine
Night letter
Come be mine
Nothing better than a
Hot night letter
Night letter
Oh so cool
Night letter
Hear me drool
Nothing wetter than a
Hot night letter

Night letter
Did you remember to slap the flap
Night letter
Did you remember you have to say
S-w-a-k
Night letter
Mail it early
Night letter
Avoid the rush
Hope you get a
Night letter

Oh, my father would enforce me to marry a vain and foolish
Suitor of fabulous great wealth to stuff the coffers
Of his government and pay for the vain and foolish
War my father uses for his own ends.
Help me...
