------ What Will Become of Our England? ------
--- Waiter ---
From the ladies dining at the Berkeley
To the Lizas ippling in the pubs,
From the girls who frighten
The kippers down at Brighton
To the dowagers rippling in their tubs,
From the girls who b'lieve that life is rosy
To their sisters harder to convince,
From the gayer set to the glummer set,
From the great soubrettes in London's mummer set,
To the girls even dumber down in Somerset,
They're all in love with the prince.
--- Girls ---
Oh, we're all so in love with the Prince.
--- Waiter ---
So what will become of our England
When the Prince of Wales finds a wife?
Who's going to dance with our debutantes,
Who's going to worry our maiden aunts?
What will become of our fair sex
When Prince Charming furls his sails?
What will become of our England?
And what will become of our Prince of Wales
--- Girls ---
What will become of our England
When the Prince of Wales finds a wife?
Who's going to dance with our debutantes,
Who's going to worry our maiden aunts?
What will become of our fair sex
When Prince Charming furls his sails?
As a lover he charms, as a husband he'll bore,
As a lover he's dovoted, as a husband - no more,
As a lover he loves you, as a husband he'll snore,
