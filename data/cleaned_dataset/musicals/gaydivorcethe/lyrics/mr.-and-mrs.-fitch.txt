------ Mr. and Mrs. Fitch ------
--- VERSE ---
On a farm far from pleasant,
No pair was more peasant
Than Mister and Missus Fitch
Their days, each one duller,
Were so lacking in color
They didn't know which was which.
When suddenly tilling the soil
Mister Fitch struck oil.
--- Unknown ---
Mister and Missus Fitch one day
Hit town, determined to play.
Mister and Missus Fitch were green,
Ambitious, but rich.
And soon the crowd they call elite
Were fighting madly to meet
The young, attractive, and rich,
Mister and Missus Fitch.
When they called for champagne,
Champagne arrived.
An aeroplane,
The plane arrived.
A private train,
The train arrived.
But when they called for cash
The crash arrived.
--- Unknown ---
Now men who once knew Missus Fitch
Refer to her as a bitch.
While the girls who once loved Mister Fitch
Say he always was a son of a bitch.
So love and kisses,
Mister and Missus Fitch.
--- ALTERNATIVE VERSION FOR THE LAST VERSE ---
Now men who once knew Missus Fitch
Refer to her as a witch.
While the girls who once loved Mister Fitch
Say he always was a son of the rich.
So love and kisses,
