------ How's Your Romance? ------
--- Tonetti ---
In Italia the signori are so very amatory,
That their passion, a priori, is l'amor.
--- Girls ---
Is it always l'amor?
--- Tonetti ---
Si` sempre l'amore.
And from Napoli to Pisa,
Ev'ry man has
On his knees a
Little private Mona Lisa
To adore.
--- Girls ---
And he once said before,
It's always l'amore,
--- Tonetti ---
The result is,
When Italians meet a friend who's been away,
Instead of sayin' How's your health?
They say--
--- Unknown ---
How's your romance?
How is it going?
Waning or growing,
How's your romance?
Does she or not love you an awful lot?
Cold, tepid, warm, or hot,
How's your romance?
Do you from the moment you met her
Never, never, never forget her?
Do you when she sends you a letter,
Begin to go into a dance,
Break me the news,
I'm with you win or lose,
So tell me how's and who's your romance?
--- Girls ---
Do you from the moment you met him
Never, never, never forget him?
Do you when he wants you to let him,
Begin to go into a dance?
--- All ---
Break me the news,
I'm with you win or lose,
