------ I've Got You on My Mind ------
--- She ---
You can't be much surprised to hear
I think you are sweller than swell,
--- He ---
But granting all your virtues, dear,
You've certain failings as well.
--- She ---
You don't sing enough, you don't dance enough,
--- He ---
You don't drink the great wines of France enough!
--- She ---
You're not wild enough,
--- He ---
You're not gay enough,
--- She ---
You don't let me lead you astray enough.
--- He ---
You don't live enough, you don't dare enough,
You don't give enough,
--- She ---
You don't care enough,
--- He ---
You don't make my sad life sunny enough.
--- She ---
Yet, sweetheart, funny enough--
--- Unknown ---
I've got you on my mind
Although I'm disinclined,
You're not so hot, you,
But I've got you on my mind.
--- He ---
I'd thank the gods above
If I could only love
Somebody not you
But I've got you on my mind.
--- She ---
Let my poor upset leisure be
Otherwise my pet treasure be
--- He ---
And arrange to let pleasure be
A bit less refined.
--- Both ---
For, darling, not until
I get thet famous thrill
Will I be resigned.
