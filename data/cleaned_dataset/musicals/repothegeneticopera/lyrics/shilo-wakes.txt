You could of-you
You scare me to death

That took your dear mother from us
Past from her and into your veins
I'd be lost if i were to lose you
I will stop at nothing to keep you safe
--- Shiloh ---
I'll take my meds dad
Don't you worry
--- Nathan ---
Just until i find a cure
Your mother rest her soul
Would be so proud of you
Though you cannot see her
She is here with you
We will always be there for you
In your time of need
--- Unknown ---
Shiloh your the world to me
