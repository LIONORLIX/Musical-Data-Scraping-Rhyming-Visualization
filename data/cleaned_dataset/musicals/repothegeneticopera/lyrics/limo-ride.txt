Shilo
Thanks for coming
It's nice to see young talent brewing
My kids have been...well disappointing
I'm rotti largo
--- Shiloh ---
I know
--- Rotti ---
I own geneco
--- Shiloh ---
Please let me go
--- Rotti ---
Sorry to be so difficult
But i had no choice
You're a tough one to find
Climbing through holes
Tell me why do you hide
Your pretty face
--- Shiloh ---
I cannot be outside
I have a blood disease
--- Rotti ---
But there is hope an antidote
And you could be the first to sample it
The geneco fix to a blood diseases
And i could use someone like you
The poster child of progress
It's the cure you sought shiloh
Your chance to see the world shiloh
It's in our grasp
--- Shiloh ---
I-i don't
--- Rotti ---
A function awaits
Will you be my date?
--- Shiloh ---
I-i can't
--- Rotti ---
Blind mag will be there
--- Shiloh ---
Mag?
--- Rotti ---
You two should meet
--- Shiloh ---
No
I must leave
My dad will worry
--- Rotti ---
Who says that daddy needs to know everything?
