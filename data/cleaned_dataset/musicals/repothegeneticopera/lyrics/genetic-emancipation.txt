------ Genetic Emancipation ------
--- Unknown ---
Years.
It's been so many years.
Resenting the years in my heredity.
--- Unknown ---
Oh, I have hated and loved you
I have hidden behind you
but I finally see.
--- Unknown ---
You, I've mistaken for destiny
but the truth is my legacy is not up to my genes.
True, though the imprint is deep in me
it will always be up to me.
Up to me.
--- Unknown ---
Oh, ohhhhhhhhhhh, ohhhhhhh.
Free at last.
Oh, ohhhhhhhhhhh, ohhhhhhh.
