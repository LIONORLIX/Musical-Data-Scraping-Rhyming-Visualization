------ Aching Hour ------
--- Mag ---
In my aching hour
As I stand to face myself
In this final hour
Bitter fate I accept
--- Unknown ---
This must be my - my aching hour
This must be my - my aching hour
--- Unknown ---
Tonight I will settle all my debts
Tonight I will sever ties
Tonight I am coming to collect
Tonight I will sing my life
--- Unknown ---
I've made my peace
All debts are paid
------ fin ------
