------ Shilo Turns Against Rotti ------
--- Shilo ---
I am not a murderer!
--- Rotti ---
But you share your dad's genetics! What if he passed this to you?
--- Shilo ---
I don't have to share his choices
--- Rotti ---
Didn't you say you were infected,
didn't you? Didn't you?
--- Nathan ---
I poisoned you, I'm worse than Rotti...
imprisoned you, I couldn't lose you
what have I done?
Forgive me Shilo, I drugged your blood,
oh God, what have I done?
--- Shilo ---
You used my mother's death to use my father, you used my father's debt to use me too!
--- Rotti ---
Your dad deserved whatever happened to him! He needed me, and so do you!
--- Nathan and chorus ---
I remember!
--- Nathan ---
Remember my mistakes,
remember you can change,
remember that I love you!
I'm sorry that I failed you!
Remember that it's up to you...
to go and shape your life into
one that's worth of remembering....
--- Shilo ---
No!
