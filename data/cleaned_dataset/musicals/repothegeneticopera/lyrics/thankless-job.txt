------ Thankless Job ------
--- Chorus ---
Reeepo maaan! Reeepo maaan!
--- Repo man ---
It's a thankless job,
But somebody's got to do it...
Peelin' off the tissue inch-by-inch,
Skinnin' off the muscles, too.
Harvesting the kidneys for the fall.
Savin' up the livers in the fridge.
No one ever thanks me when i'm done.
How self-absorbed people can be!
--- Unknown ---
With a slice, or a snip,
Eenie-meenie-minie-moo...
With a cut, and a stitch,
Returning organs good as new!
--- Unknown ---
It's a thankless job!
But somebody's got to do it!
Like a mop!
And a broom!
