------ Happiness Is Not A Warm Scalpel ------
--- Amber ---
I've never been so surgically maimed!
--- Rotti ---
Amber, please, it's not that bad.
--- Amber ---
I'll be the laughingstock of the stage!
--- Rotti ---
Daughter, please, it's not so bad.
--- Amber ---
This is your fault!
I asked you to help me!
--- Rotti ---
Now, amber, please.
I warned you about this.
Happiness is not a warm scalpel.
--- Amber ---
I don't care! It's not fair!
--- Rotti ---
Baby, baby, baby, don't do this.
--- Amber ---
I will never sing again!
--- Rotti ---
I gave you the life i wished i'd had.
--- Amber ---
I look like a crime scene, dad.
--- Rotti ---
All you ever do is take, take, take. All i ever do is give.
I said nothing when you came to me
Asking, can i be asian?
--- Amber ---
That surgery was only $90 grand!
--- Rotti ---
I did not complain
When you changed your name
From largo to sweet.
--- Amber ---
I need a stage name!
--- Rotti ---
You are a disgrace!
