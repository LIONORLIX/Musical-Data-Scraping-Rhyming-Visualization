------ Cut the Ties ------
--- Rotti ---
Your mother once promised her love to me.
Had she never fled, you'd be mine.
Deny your father now
For the world to see!
Kill him.
--- Luigi ---
Kill him!
--- Rotti ---
And I leave you GeneCo!
--- Luigi ---
What!?
--- Pavi ---
All of it?
--- Rotti ---
Oh, yes!
--- Pavi ---
Oh, no!
--- Rotti ---
So, witness it people!
All I have to do is sign the paper!
All you have to do is pull the trigger!
--- Luigi ---
Don't leave it to her!
Leave it to me!
--- Pavi ---
Leave it to me!
Don't leave it to her!
--- Shilo ---
You want to pay me to kill my father?
Kill my father!?
You want me to kill!
--- Rotti ---
I want you to do what is right!
This man killed your mother, your mother!
He betrayed you both, he's a liar!
And he poisoned you!
--- Shilo ---
I am not a murderer!
--- Rotti ---
But you share your dad's genetics! What if he passed this to you?
--- Shilo ---
I don't have to share his choices
--- Rotti ---
Didn't you say you were infected,
didn't you? Didn't you?
--- Nathan ---
I poisoned you, I'm worse than Rotti...
imprisoned you, I couldn't lose you
what have I done?
Forgive me Shilo, I drugged your blood,
oh God, what have I done to you?
--- Shilo ---
You used my mother's death to use my father,
you used my father's debt to use me too!
--- Rotti ---
Your dad deserved whatever happened to him!
He needed me, and so do you!
--- Nathan and chorus ---
I remember!
--- Nathan ---
Remember my mistakes,
remember you can change,
remember that I love you!
I'm sorry that I failed you!
Remember that it's up to you...
to go and shape your life into
one that's worth of remembering....
--- Shilo ---
No!
