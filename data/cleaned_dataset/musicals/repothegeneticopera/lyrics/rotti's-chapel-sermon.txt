------ Rotti's Chapel Sermon ------
--- Rotti ---
Shilo, the past can be dreadful.
There are those who kept you in the dark to protect you.
You're old enough, i think -
Though they'd disagree -
To know the truth,
And choose who you will be.
--- Unknown ---
To get your cure,
You'll need to light up that dark place.
This grave-robber here can help you dig the way.
But you'll have to earn it.
Nobody deserves shit.
I gave my kids the world.
They repaid me with spit.
You'll need to bring illumination
To the situation
