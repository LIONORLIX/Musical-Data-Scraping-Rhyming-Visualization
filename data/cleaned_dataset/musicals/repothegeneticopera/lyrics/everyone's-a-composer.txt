--- Mag ---
I'd be present in shilo's life.
--- Nathan ---
Please!
--- Nathan ---
Mag, shilo is very ill.
It's not safe for her to see people.
I need to give her her medication.
--- Shilo ---
Dad, let her stay in here.
--- Nathan ---
No, she's leaving.
--- Shilo ---
Please, hide her here.

Nathan, what has
Become of you?
You've turned this
House into a tomb.
Marni wouldn't want
This for her!

She is sick.
You've upset her.
I can't have this.
I'm not going to ask
Again!
--- Mag ---
Set her free!
Set her free!
Shilo:
Mag, don't leave!
Please, don't leave!
Nathan:
Leave our house!
