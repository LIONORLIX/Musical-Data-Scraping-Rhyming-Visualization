------ Epitaph ------
--- Graverobber ---
Goth opera
Blood saga
Sometimes i wonder how we ever got here
Old grudges
Scorn lovers
Sometimes i wonder why we all don't move on
--- Unknown ---
Cause we all end up in a tiny pine box
A mighty small drop in a mighty dark plot
And the mighty fine print hastens the trip to our epilogue (epilogue!)
But the little girl fled and the king is dead
And the castle is left for the taking
But geneco may survive if it undergoes surgery, surgery?
--- Unknown ---
(surgery surgery)
