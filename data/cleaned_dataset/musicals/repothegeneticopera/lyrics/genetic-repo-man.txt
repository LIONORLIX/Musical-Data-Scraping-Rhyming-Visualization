Reeepo maaan! Reeepo maaan!
--- Graverobber ---
Out from the night, from the mist, steps the figure.
No one really knows his name for sure.

But he always has a way of finding you.
He will come at your weakest hour,
When no one is around who might rescue you.
--- Chorus ---
Reeepo maaan! Reeepo maaan!
--- Graverobber ---
And none of us are free from this horror,

And until our debts are clear,
We will live in fear of the...
--- Chorus ---
Reeepo maaan! Reeepo maaan!
