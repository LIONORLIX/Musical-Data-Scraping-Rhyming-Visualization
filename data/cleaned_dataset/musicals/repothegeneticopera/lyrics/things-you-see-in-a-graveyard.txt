Things you see in a graveyard.

Maggots, vermin,
You want the world for nothing.
Commence your groveling.
Rotti, your king, is dying.
Even rotti largo
Cannot prevent this passing.
Who will inherit geneco’
I’ll keep those vultures guessing.

Ashes (ashes). Dust (dust).
My children were a bust.
They shall inherit nothing.
No, my legacy is too great
To throw away on ingrates.
Nathan wallace had potential,
‘til he stole my marni away.
In denial, nathan blamed himself
For marni’s sudden death,
And never once thought to suspect
The man who wrote his checks.
I guess, i’ll take it to my death.

--- Rotti ---
I’ll take it to my death’
Marni, it’s rotti.
You never should have left me.
I would’ve given you the world.
It’s been difficult to see you,
After what you put me through.
You forced my hand and made me do...
Well...it looks like i’ll be joining you.
It seems the man who cured the globe
Cannot stop his own extinction...
But i can go out with a bang!
