I'm...infected
I'm infected

Shilo, I'm the doctor
Shilo, I'm your father
Oh, Shilo, that was close!
Take your medicine
--- Unknown ---
I'm infected by your genetics
Shilo, you're my patient
Shilo, be more patient
You have limitations, don't go chasing flies
I must be protective
You cannot be reckless
That's what is expected when you are infected
--- Unknown ---
I'm infected by your genetics
I'm infected by your genetics
And I don't think that I can be fixed
No, I don't think that I can be fixed
Tell me why, oh why are my genetics such a bitch?

It's this blood condition
Damn this blood condition!
Mother can you hear me?
Thanks for the disease!
Now I am sequestered
Part of the collection
That's what is expected when you are infected

That's what is expected when you are infected
That's what is expected when you are infected

How much of it is fate?

Is heredity the culprit?
Can I stop it, or am I a slave?

I'm infected by your genetics
I'm infected by your genetics
What hope has a girl who is sick?
My dream of a life past this fence
It really makes no difference
'Cause I know that I'll never be fixed
Tell me why, oh why are my genetics such a bitch?
--- Unknown ---
Oh, I want to go outside
Outside
Oh, I want to go outside
Outside
