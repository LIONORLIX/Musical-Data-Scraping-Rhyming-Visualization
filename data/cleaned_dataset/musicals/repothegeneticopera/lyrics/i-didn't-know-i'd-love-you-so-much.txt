------ I Didn't Know I'd Love You So Much ------
--- Shilo ---
Dad be still,
there is nothing you need say,
it can wait.
--- Nathan ---
Shi, your mother's calling me.
--- Shilo ---
Sometimes I wanted to cry
when the people on TV were not quite the way we were
somehow I guess I just knew.
But I didn't know I'd love you so much
I didn't know I'd love you so much
I didn't know I'd love you so much
but I do.
--- Nathan ---
Sometimes I'd stay up all night
wishing to God that I was the one who died.
Sometimes it's not enough time.
But I didn't know I'd love you so much
I didn't know I'd love you so much
I didn't know I'd love you so much
but I do.
--- Shilo ---
Didn't know I'd love you so much.
--- Nathan ---
Didn't know I'd love you so much.
--- Both ---
Didn't know I'd love you so much
but I do.
--- Nathan ---
Shilo, go.
--- Shilo ---
Dad, I will not leave you here
you will live.
--- Nathan ---
But you've already saved me, dear.
Go and change the world for me.
--- Both ---
We will always have each other
in our time of need
(Shilo) Daddy, you're the world to me.
