(You Can't Stop the Beat)
--- Unknown ---
You can't stop the trendy trends
Pop culture brings today.
And in Hairspray no one here pretends
We got something deep to say.
So don't you try to stop our dancin' feet,
Or our racial expose.
--- Unknown ---
Cause the sets keep spinnin' round and round,
And our volume is pumped to a blarin' sound,
But HAIRSPRAY will still astound
As the good time champ,
And you can't stop the camp!
You can't stop the camp!
--- SPOKEN ---
And to prove my point, let me introduce you to the greatest diva of the century!
--- SUNG ---
I am Harvey Fierstein and I LIKE the way I am!
When I did Torch Song Trilogy I didn't give a damn!
And so they've taken back my Pulitzer,
Because now I am a ham.
I did serious drama in my day,
But it wasn't much fun and it didn't pay!
So I descended to drag, and now I play a FEM!
--- Unknown ---
You can't stop the camp!
Ever since this great art began,
An actor found out he could shake it up
By shaking his can!
And so I'm gonna shake and shimmy it
And mug all i can today!
--- Unknown ---
And you can't stop the-
Tacky, silly, wacky shows from playing today
And it's drama doing drama or a serious play
So let's bring the theater down
Because this kitchy cliche is champ
And you can't stop the camp
--- Unknown ---
AHMIGAWD!
I am Laura Bundy and of broadness I am fond
And on any night but monday night
I'm illegally bleach blonde!
Cause I'm a wannabe Reese Witherspoon
So you might feel just a little conned
But big flashy sets slide in and out
And I prance in the pink
And I pose and I pout
And my volume is so pumped up
I blow out an amp
And you can't stop the camp!
--- SPOKEN ---
Ooh... who are you?
--- SUNG ---
--- Unknown ---
Don't you recognize me from Pulp Fiction
And from Grease?
Can't you see I'm John Travolta and
I always pack a piece!
But in the brand new film of Hairspray,
I'm packed to be obese!
And now I'm getting campy too
Maybe next I'll appear in Xanadu
Every musical carries a cute and cuddly stamp
--- Unknown ---
And you can't stop the-
Tacky, silly, wacky shows from playing today
And it's drama doing drama or a serious play
And bursting into song is unacceptable
And so gay!
--- Unknown ---
You can't stop the-
Mighty mega musicals
From hitting the screen
And even John Travolta is a big old queen!
We're sick of musicals so kitchy cliche is champ
And you can't stop the camp!
You can't stop the camp!
You can't stop the camp!
YOU CAN'T STOP THE CAMP!!!!
