------ Who's Sorry Now? ------
--- Unknown ---
Who's sorry now, who's sorry now?
Whose heart is aching for breaking each vow?
Who's sad and blue, who's crying too?
Just like I cried over you...
--- Unknown ---
Right to the end, just like a friend,
I tried to warn you, somehow,
Aaaaaaaaahhh!
You had your way, now you must pay,
