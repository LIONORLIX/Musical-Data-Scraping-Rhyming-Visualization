------ I Gotcha ------
--- Unknown ---
I gotcha, ahh-ha-hah
You thought I didn't see you now, didn't you? Ahh-ha-hah
You tried to sneak by me now, didn't you? Ahh-ha-hah
Now give me what you promised to me, give it to me, come on
--- Unknown ---
You promised me the day that you quit your girlfriend
That I'd be the next one to move on in
You promised me it would be just us two
And I'd be the only one kissin' on you
--- Unknown ---
Now kiss me, hold it a long time, hold it
Oh, don't turn me loose now hold it
A little bit longer now hold it, come on hold it
Hold it, hold it, hold it, don't be greedy now, get back
--- Unknown ---
You made me a promise and you're gonna stick to it
You should'nt promised if you wasn't gonna do it
You saw me and ran in another direction
I'll teach you to play with my affection
--- Unknown ---
Now give it here, you never should've promised to me
Give it here, don't hold back, now give it here
Don't say nothin' just give it here, come on
Give it, give it, give it, give it, come on, give it to me
