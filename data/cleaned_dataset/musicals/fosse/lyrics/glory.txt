Blood!
--- Unknown ---
Blood is red as sunset
Blood is warmer than wine
The taste of salty summer brine
Uh huh
--- Unknown ---
Steel!
--- ALL ---
Steel is cold as moonlight
Steel as sharper than sight
The touch of bitter winter white
--- SOLDIERS ---
Shout it out from the highest tower
shout it out in the darkest hour
Charlemagne, you lead us on to
--- ALL ---
Power!
