------ There'll Be Some Changes Made ------
--- Unknown ---
You better change your way of livin'
And if that ain't enough
You better change your way you strut your stuff
'Cause nobody wants you when you're old and gray
You better change your way today
You better change your way...

- Can you hear me ? I'm talking to ya!
- You gotta lay off the boose!
- abstain and vitamins!
- You better stop screwing around!
--- Unknown ---
You better stop
You better change
You better stop
You better change
You better stop
You better change
You better stop
You better change
You better stop
You better change and change your way today!
I said stop, change, stop, please!
