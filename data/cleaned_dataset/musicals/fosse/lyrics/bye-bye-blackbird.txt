------ Bye Bye Blackbird ------
--- Unknown ---
Pack up all my care and woe,
Here I go,
Singing low,
Bye bye blackbird,
Where somebody waits for me,
Sugar's sweet, so is she,
Bye bye
Blackbird!
--- Unknown ---
No one here can love or understand me,
Oh, what hard luck stories they all hand me,
Make my bed and light the light,
I'll be home late tonight,
Blackbird bye bye.

Bye (bye) bye (bye) blackbird.
Where somebody waits for me,
Sugar's sweet, so is she,
Bye (bye) bye (bye) blackbird.

No one here can love or understand me,
Oh, what hard luck stories they all hand me,
Make my bed, light that light,
I'll be home late tonight,
Blackbird...

Make my bed and light the light,
I'll be home late tonight,
Leave you bird jet in the sky
Toodle oo!
Farewell!
Bye bye!
