I got a song been on my mind
And the tune can be sung and the words all rhyme
Deedle-ee deet deet deet deet deet deet deet dee deedle-ee doo
--- Unknown ---
Though it don't say much and it won't offend
If you sing it in school then they're liable to send you home
Never knowing what you're showin'
Think you're growin' your own tea
Good lord!
--- Unknown ---
Let me hear that!
Let me hear that!
Crunchy granola's suite
Sing it out
Alright

I know a man was outta touch
And he'd hide in a house and he didn't say much
Deedle-ee deet deet deet deet deet deet deet deedle-ee doo
--- Unknown ---
And like a man with a tiger outside his gate
He not only couldn't relax but he couldn't relate
Now he can
Family man
Tried my brand
Dig
--- Unknown ---
Let me hear that!
Let me hear that!

Drop your shrink and stop your drinkin'
