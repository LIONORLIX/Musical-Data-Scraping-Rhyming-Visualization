------ Life Is Just A Bowl Of Cherries - Reprise ------
--- Unknown ---
Life is just a bowl of cherries
Don't take it serious,
Life's too mysterious
You work,
You save,
You worry so
But you can't take your dough
When you go, go, go
--- Unknown ---
So keep repeating "It's the berries."
The strongest oak must fall
The sweet things in life
To you were just loaned
So how can you lose
What you've never owned
--- Unknown ---
Life is just a bowl of cherries
So live and laugh,
Laugh and love
Live and laugh at it all!

The strongest oak must fall
The sweet things in life
To you were just loaned
So how can you lose
What you've never owned
--- Unknown ---
Life is just a bowl of cherries
So live and laugh, aha!
Laugh and love
Live and laugh,
Laugh and love,
