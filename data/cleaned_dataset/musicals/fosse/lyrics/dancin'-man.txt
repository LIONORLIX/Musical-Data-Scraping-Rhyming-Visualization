------ Dancin' Man ------
--- Unknown ---
I wanna be a dancin' man,
While I can,
Gonna leave my footsteps on the sands of time,
If I never leave a dime.
Never be a millionaire,
I don't care,
I'll be rich as old King Midas might have been
Least until the tide rolls in
Let other men build the mighty nations,
Or stairways to the sky,
I'll leave a few creations
To show that I was a dancin' by.
--- Unknown ---
I wanna be free as any bird can be, yes siree,
I wanna leave my footsteps on the sands of time,
If I never leave a dime, dime.
A dancin' man
With footsteps
On the sands...
Of rhythm....and rhyme.
