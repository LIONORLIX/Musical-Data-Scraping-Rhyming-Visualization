Take off with us
Take off with us
We want an up so
We want an up - with us
We want to relate
Going all the way
Wan't you climb aboard to ride us
Do dus (glide with us, glide with us)
Meet our friendly eager crew
They only live to service you ? service, service, service, service
This right ? this right comes from these?
With your choice of seat
And any seat you'll grab will
Be first (fly with us)
Up there where the clands are billowing
And you are so close to heaven as
You'll ever be, clean back, relax
Here come the snacks
Drop your ties
Have a ball
Don't stop don't stop don't stop with one
Trying more, trying more. (yeah,yeah,yeah)
Music is ready to begin
Take out your headset
That's all you need
What's your answer choice
Are you gonna come
On the coolest hottest, coolest, hottest, coolest, hottest
Trip that's ever been .(And you are so close to heaven as you'll ever be)
