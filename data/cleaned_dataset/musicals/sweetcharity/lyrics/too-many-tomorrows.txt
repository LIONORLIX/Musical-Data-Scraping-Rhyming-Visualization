------ Too Many Tomorrows ------
--- Vittorio ---
Please don't go, my love,
I'm frightened of
Too many tomorrows
Around this haunted place.
If I set you free what's left for me,
Too many tomorrows
I simply cannot face.
Those passionate words we find
To grieve each other
Do not mean we'll leave each other.
So come fill my arms
And we'll forget the meaningless sorrows
Each time we say we're through.
Darling, can't you see
There can't ever be
Too many tomorrows
If you stay with me...
So come fill my arms
And we'll forget the meaningless sorrows
Each time we say we're through.
Darling, can't you see
There can never be
Too many tomorrows
