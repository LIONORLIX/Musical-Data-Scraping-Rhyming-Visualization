------ I'm a Brass Band ------
--- Charity ---
Someone loves me!
Someone loves me!
Someone loves me,
My heart is beating so fast.
All kinds of music is pouring out of me,
Somebody loves me at last!
Now...
I'm a brass band,
I'm a harpsichord;
I'm a clarinet!
I'm the Philadelphia Orchestra,
I'm the Modern Jazz Quartet!
I'm the band from Macy's Big Parade.
A wild Count Basie blast!
I'm the bells from Saint Peter's in Rome
I'm tissue paper on a comb...
And all kinds of music
Is pouring out of me 'cause...
Somebody loves me...at last!
Chorus:
She's a brass band,
She's a harpsichord,
She's a clarinet!
Charity:
That's me!
Chorus:
She's the Philadelphia Orchestra,
She's the Modern Jazz Quartet!
She's a brass band,
She's a harpsichord,
She's a clarinet!
She's the Philadelphia Orchestra,
She's the Modern Jazz Quartet!
She's the band from Macy's Big Parade
A wild Count Basie blast!
She's the bells from Saint Peter's in Rome
She's tissue paper on a comb...
