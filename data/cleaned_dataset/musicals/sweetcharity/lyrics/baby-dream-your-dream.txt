------ Baby Dream Your Dream ------
--- Girls ---
Baby,
Dream Your Dream.
Close your eyes and try it.
Dream of furniture;
Dream that I can buy it.
That fancy bed you prayed for,
Not only bought but paid for.
Dream we sign the lease,
Leave a small deposit;
Three and one-half rooms
With a walking closet.
We'll ask the local Jet-set
To dine on our dinette-set
Right across the street,
There's a friendly bank.
You make a friendly loan,
And the bank says: Thank you.
Ev'ry Saturday,
We'll spend all our money.
Join the P.T.A.;
They will love you, honey.
Life will be frozen peaches and cream.
