------ Where Am I Going? ------
--- Charity ---
Where am I going?
And what will I find?
What's in this grab-bag that I call my mind?
What am I doing alone on the shelf?
Ain't it a shame,
No one's to blame, but myself...
Which way is clear?
When you've lost your way year after year?
Do I keep falling in love
For just the kick of it?
Staggering through the thin and thick of it,
Hating each old and tired trick of it.
Know what I am,
I'm good and sick of it!
Where am I going?
Why do I care?
Run to the Bronx, or Washington Square,
No matter where I run I meet myself there,
Looking inside me, what do I see?
Anger and hope and doubt,
What am I all about?
And where am I going?
You tell me!
Where am I going?
Why do I care?
Run to the Bronx, or Washington Square,
No matter where I run I meet myself there,
Looking inside me, what do I see?
Anger and hope and doubt
What am I all about?
And where am I going?
