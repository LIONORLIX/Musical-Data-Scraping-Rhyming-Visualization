------ There's Gotta Be Something Better Than This ------
--- Girls ---
There's gotta be something better than this,
There's gotta be something better to do.
And when I find me something better to do,
I'm gonna get up, I'm gonna get out
I'm gonna get up, get out and do it!
There's gotta be some respectable trade,
There's gotta be something easy to learn.
And if I find me something I halfwit can learn,
I'm gonna get up, I'm gonna get out
I'm gonna get up, get out and learn it!
All these jokers, how I hate them
With their groping, grabbing, clutching, clinching,
Strangling, handling, bumbling, pinching
There's gotta be some life cleaner than this,
There's gotta be some good reason to live.
And when I find me some kind of life I can live,
I'm gonna get up, I'm gonna get out,
I'm gonna get up, get out and live it!
Right!
Nickie:
I got it! I got it!
I'm gonna be a receptionist
In one of those glass office buildings
Nine to five, I'm gonna have my own typewriter,
And water cooling and office parties...
Ooooh, and coffee breaks...wow!
Then I sit on my desk on the forty-first floor
In my copy of a copy of a copy of Dior!
I'll receive VIP tycoons
And I'll point to a chair
I'll say: honey, what you're waiting?
How would you like to put it down over there?
All:
Yeah!
There's gotta be something better than this,
There's gotta be something better to do,
And when I find me something better to do.
I'm gonna get up, I'm gonna get out
I'm gonna get up, get out and do it!
Helene:
Me too...Me too!
I'm gonna get a year to go right to the top
I'm gonna be a hat chat girl
At one of the East Side, high class restaurants
You know, a tray of cigarettes,
Costing 66 cents a pack and keep the change?
And all those hats coming in
Dirbies, humbirds...
Ooooh! And that cute little checked number
With that skinny brim and a feather
Take your hat, sir!
Take your coat, sir!
Take your vest, sir!
Take your pants!
Take your socks, sir!
Take your shoes, sir!
I can hold them while you dance
Take your eyes, sir!
Take your ears, sir!
Take and see if you are free
How about it after hours
I'll take you and you'll take me!
Charity:
Me too...I'm gonna get out too!
Nickie:
But, baby, what would you do?
Charity:
I don't know...Just get me out of here and I'll figure out later!
There's gotta be some life cleaner than this
There's gotta be some good reason to live
All:
And when I find me some kind of life I can live
I'm gonna get up...
I'm gonna get out...
La la la la la la ...
How wow how wow
And when I find me some kind of life I can live
I'm gonna get up...
I'm gonna get up...
