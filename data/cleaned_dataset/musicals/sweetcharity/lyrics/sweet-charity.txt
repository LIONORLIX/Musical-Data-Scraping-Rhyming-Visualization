------ Sweet Charity ------
--- Oscar ---
Here was a man
With no dream and no plan,
And one lovely night I found
Sweet Charity.
You made life fun for me,
Oh, what it's done for me,
Having you around,
Sweet Charity.
Warm words
I've never said lately
Pop off the top of my head,
It's incredible.
Suddenly I'm the guy
I never dared to be,
Watch me touch the sky
Quite easily.
So, if you are free,
Sweet Charity,
Please belong to me,
Sweet, Sweet Charity,
Warm words
I've never said lately
Pop off the top of my head,
Incredible.
If by and by
You and I should be we
I could touch the sky
Quite easily.
So, if you are free,
Sweet Charity,
Please belong to me,
Sweet Charity,
