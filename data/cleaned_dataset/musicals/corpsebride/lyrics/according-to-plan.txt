It's a beautiful day.

It's a rather nice day.
--- Unknown ---
Mrs. VanDort
A day for a glorious wedding.
--- Unknown ---
Mr. VanDort
A rehearsal, my dear, to be perfectly clear.
--- Unknown ---
Mrs. VanDort
A rehearsal for a glorious wedding.
--- Unknown ---
Mr. VanDort
Assuming nothing happens that we don't really know,
--- Unknown ---
Mrs. VanDort
That nothing unexpected interferes with the show.
--- Unknown ---
Mr. And Mrs. VanDort
And that's why everything, every last little thing,
every single tiny microscopic little thing must go...
--- Unknown ---
Mrs. VanDort
According to plan,
--- Unknown ---
Mr. VanDort
Our son will be married.
--- Unknown ---
Mrs. VanDort
According to plan,
--- Unknown ---
Mr. VanDort
Our family carried,

Mrs. VanDort
Rubbing elbows with the finest.

Mr. VanDort
Having crumpets with her highness.
--- Unknown ---
Mr. And Mrs. VanDort
We'll be there, we'll be seen, having tea with the queen.
We'll forget everything...that we've ever ever been.

Mrs. Everglot
It's a terrible day
--- Unknown ---
Mr. Everglot
Now don't be that way
--- Unknown ---
Mrs. Everglot
It's a terrible day for a wedding.
--- Unknown ---
Mr. Everglot
It's a sad, sad state of affairs we're in,
--- Unknown ---
Mrs. Everglot
That has led to this ominous wedding.
--- Unknown ---
Mr. Everglot
How could our family have come to this?
--- Unknown ---

To marry off our daughter to the noveaux-rich.
--- Unknown ---
Mrs. Everglot
They're so common,

Mr. Everglot
So coarse.
--- Unknown ---
Mrs. Everglot
Oh, it couldn't be worse!
--- Unknown ---
Mr. Everglot
It couldn't be worse? I'm afraid I disagree.
It could be land-rich bankrupt aristocracy,
without a penny to their name...just like you...and me.

--- Unknown ---
Mr. Everglot
of an otter in disgrace,

Would provide our ticket to our rightful place?
--- Unknown ---
Victoria (speaking)
What if Victor and I don't...like each other?
--- Unknown ---
Mrs. Everglot (speaking)
Do you suppose your father and I like each other?
--- Unknown ---
Victoria (speaking)
Surely you must...a little...
--- Unknown ---
Mr. and Mrs. Everglot (speaking)
Of course not!
--- Unknown ---
Mrs. Everglot (speaking)
Get those corsets laced properly...I can hear you speak without gasping.
Marriage is a partnership. A little tit-for-tat.
You'd think a lifetime watching us (singing) might have taught her that.
Might have taught her that.
