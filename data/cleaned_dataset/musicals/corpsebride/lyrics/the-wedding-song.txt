------ The Wedding Song ------
--- Group Chorus ---
Wedding, a wedding, we're going to have a wedding, a wedding! (repeats)
--- Spider Chorus ---
The spiders think you're very cute, but goodness knows you need a suit.
But have no fears, we're quite adept, we'll have you looking lovely(7Xs)yet.
A little stitch, a little tuck, some tender loving care.
A little thread will fix you up and we've got plenty as you see,
And personally guarantee our quality repairs.
A little here, a fix of this, We're going to do our best.
When everybody sees you, they will all be quite impressed.
They will all be quite impressed.

On her glorious day of days.
