My dearest husband,
I have resolved to run away and meet you.
A coloured man named Reynolds has come round and says he can take me north by way of the river.
I know God loves us, and He will help me find you.

We break our backs for the master's pleasure
Waitin' for that sweet old by and by
And singin' Go Down Moses at the levee
Until we lay our burden down and die
But they say there's a new wind that's blowin'
Down the mighty Mississippi dressed in blue
Shakin' loose these chains that bind me
Until this endless night is finally through
--- Unknown ---
So meet me by the River Jordan
Knee-deep in a risin' tide
And we'll climb aboard that boat called freedom
And we will all sail over to the other side
Sail on
Sain on
I said sail on
Sail on over to the other side
I said sail on
Sail on
Sail on over to the other side
--- Unknown ---
So come on, meet me by the River Jordan
Knee-deep in a risin' tide
We'll climb aboard that boat called freedom
And we'll all sail on over to the other side
We'll be singin' Halleluja
When this mis'ry sure 'nough be passed
We'll be singin' Halleluja
Halleluja, 'cause we are free at last
Hold on, hold on
When you live in the east of Eden you've
Got to pray
That you'll find yourself in paradise one day

And we'll all sail right on over to the
Other side.
