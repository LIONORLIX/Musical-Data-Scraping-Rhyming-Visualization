------ Candle in the Window ------
--- Unknown ---
Harriet Jackson
First door on the right
In a lonely window
Shines a solitary light
Burning in the window
Near a figure in a chair
Always sitting there
Quiet as a prayer
--- Unknown ---
Does he close his eyes?
Weary with the weight of being
Suddenly so wise
Tired of the demons
He must sit up there and fight
Deep into the night
Praying that he's right?
--- Unknown ---
Every evening I can see his shadow on the shade
And I don't feel so alone or so afraid
There's a candle in the window every night
Reflecting all our hopes and dreams
Or so it seems to me as I look up to see
That candle in the window every night
Burning like the yearning to be free
Far away and dim
Kept alive by him
