Bessie Toler
That man over there says that women need to be helped into
carriages and lifted over ditches, and to have the best place wherever.
Nobody ever helps me into carriages or over mud puddles,
or gives me any best place.
And ain't I a woman?
Look at me! I have ploughed and planted and gathered into
barns and no man could best me ever. But ain't I a woman?
I could work as much and eat as much as a man-
when I could get it-and bear the lash as well.
And ain't I a woman?
I have borne thirteen children and seen most all sold off into
slavery, and when I cried out with my mother's grief, ain't
nobody but Jesus heard me. And ain't I a woman?

Listen to me sister, when you feel all hope is gone
And darkness is the only thing you see
Night time ain't forever
There will be another dawn
Tomorrow all of us will be free
--- Unknown ---
Bessie Toler
I'm worn out prayin'
It's like shouting down a well
--- Unknown ---
Harriet Jackson
Hush now, girl, and hear the Good Lord call
--- Unknown ---
Bessie Toler
I try to hear him whisper
Over all this crazy hell
--- Unknown ---
Harriet Jackson
He's promising a heaven for us all
Someday

The Enslaved
Someday
Mighty pharaoh couldn't hear
What ol' Moses heard
Through the desert loud and clear
Freedom was the word
Stronger than the oak tree
When the hard winds blow
Tellin' Pharaoh let my people go
--- Unknown ---
So listen to the nightingale
Listen to his song
Hear the mighty river's tale
As she rolls along
Every time the sun comes up
Shoutin' down the day
You can almost hear the good Lord say:
Someday
We will all be free
Someday
From sea to shinin' sea
When freedom shines, shines on me
Father, Son and Holy Ghost
All of them are free Gonna break these chains and walk the walk
Gonna free the sparrow from the hawk
Gonna celebrate our independence day
Someday
--- Unknown ---
Through the deepest wilderness
Through the darkest night
You gotta keep on movin' towards the light
We'll all sit down at table
And bow our heads and pray
And all of us will find
You gotta dream the dream
That God is colorblind
You gotta keep the faith
And finally mankind
Is gonna be what it should be
Someday
We will all be free
Someday
No more misery
We will all be justified
At that jubilee
--- Unknown ---
Gonna raise our voices long and loud
Gonna hold our heads up strong and proud
Gonna break these chains and walk the walk
Gonna free the sparrow from the hawk
Gonna celebrate our independence day
Someday
Someday
Someday
