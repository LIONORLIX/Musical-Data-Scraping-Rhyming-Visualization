Five boys
Ever will they have each other
Brother ever there for brother
Safe at last and ever free
--- Unknown ---
Five boys
Playing in a field with angels
When I close my eyes I see them waiting for me
In his grace I know that their souls will find shelter
Far away from all of the madness out there
My heart and I will share a mother's one last prayer

Five boys
Playing in field with angels
Running with the wind forever
