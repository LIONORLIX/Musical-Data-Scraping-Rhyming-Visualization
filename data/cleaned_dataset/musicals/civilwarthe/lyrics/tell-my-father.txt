------ Tell My Father ------
--- Unknown ---
Private Sam Taylor
Tell my father that his son
Didn't run or surrender
That I bore his name with pride
As I tried to remember
You are judged by what you do
While passing through
--- Unknown ---
As I rest 'neath fields of green
Let him lean on your shoulder
Tell him how I spent my youth
So the truth could grow older
Tell my father, when you can
I died a man
--- Unknown ---
Tell him we will meet again
Where the angels learn to fly
Tell him we will meet as men
For with honour did I die
--- Unknown ---
Tell him I fought the blue
Proud and true, through the fire
Tell my father so he'll know
I love him so
--- Unknown ---
Tell him how I wore the gray
Just the way that he taught me
Tell my father not to cry
