------ Virginia ------
--- Unknown ---
Captain Billy Pierce
There was a time
A time of splendour and grace
When the world moved by
At a kinder pace
There was a land
A land to pleasure the eyes
Where the old was new
And the foolish wise
I can hear Virginia
When the south wind sings
And I see her shining
On a blackbird's silver wings
And I can feel Virginia
Runnin' through my soul
When the flags unfurl
And the drummers start their long, long roll
--- Unknown ---
Oh, sacred ground
For which so many have died
Let us take our turn
For our country's pride
Oh, blessed place
Remember all of your sons
Who will stand and fall
'Neath the ceaseless guns
I can hear Virginia
When the south wind sings
And I see her shining
On a blackbird's silver wings
And I can feel Virginia
Runnin' through my soul
When the flags unfurl
And the drummers start their long, long roll
--- Unknown ---
And by God I'll see her rise again
As in days gone by
May her flags all fly
I will fight until I fall and then
Fight again
--- Unknown ---
I can hear Virginia
Through the cannon roar
And I see her shining
Just beyond this bloody war
So I search for courage
In my restless soul
When the flags unfurl
And the drummers start their long, long roll
