------ If Prayin' Were Horses (reprise) ------

I don't want that kind of help, from them that can't see
They can't stop tomorrow with their fury
I've already paid in full, for what they call free
The scars on my back can be my jury
--- Unknown ---
We'll build us a new world, one that can be free
A place where they'll just let us be
If prayin' were horses, all of us would ride
Oh, Bessie, please find me some how
--- Unknown ---
Bessie Toler
I'll find you, or else I'll die. I'll find you I swear
I won't spend another day without you
Tonight there's a moonlit sky, so just say a prayer
