Oh, my God! It isn't true.
What did somebody do?
This isn't me!
What's this foot?
I know my foot.
And this is not my foot,
This isn't me!
I'm too tall to fit my bunk
And my favorite shirt has shrunk
What I'm looking at is grosse!
This isn't me!
--- Unknown ---
Oh, my God! There's nothing here that I can wear.
And where did I get all this...HAIR!
I've gotten BIG!
Everything I see
My arm, my hand, my wrist, my knee
Look every part of me has gotten... oh!
--- Unknown ---
There is something here that's wrong
It's a joke going on too long
How'd this nightmare come to be?
This isn't me!
--- Unknown ---
Zoltar!

I didn't mean it!
