------ A Quiet Thing ------
--- Unknown ---
When it all comes true
Just the way you'd planned
It's funny but the bells don't ring
It's a quiet thing
--- Unknown ---
When you hold the world
In your trembling hand
You'd think you'd hear a choir sing
It's a quiet thing
--- Unknown ---
There are no exploding fireworks
Where's the roaring of the crowds
Maybe it's the strange new atmosphere
Way up here among the clouds
--- Unknown ---
But I don't hear the drums
And I don't hear the band
The sounds I'm told
Such moments bring
--- Unknown ---
Happiness comes in on tip-toe
Well, what'd'ya know
It's a quiet thing
A very quiet thing
