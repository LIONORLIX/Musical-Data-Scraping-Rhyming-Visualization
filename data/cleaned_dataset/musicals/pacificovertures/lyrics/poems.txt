------ Poems ------
--- KAYAMA ---
Rain glistening
On the silver birch,
Like my lady's tears.
Your turn.
--- MANJIRO ---
Rain gathering,
Winding into streams,
Like the roads to Boston.
Your turn.
--- KAYAMA ---
Haze hovering,
Like the whisper of the silk,
As my lady kneels.
Your turn.
--- MANJIRO ---
Haze glittering,
Like an echo of the lamps
In the streets of Boston.
Your turn.
--- KAYAMA ---
Moon,
I love her like the moon,
Making jewels of the grass
Where my lady walks,
My lady wife.
--- MANJIRO ---
Moon,
I love her like the moon,
Washing yesterday away
As my lady does,
America.
Your turn.
--- KAYAMA ---
Wind murmuring.
Is she murmuring for me
Through her field of dreams?
Your turn.
--- MANJIRO ---
Wind muttering.
Is she quarreling with me?
Does she want me home?
Your turn.
--- KAYAMA ---
I am no nightingale,
But she hears the song
I can sing to her,
My lady wife.
--- MANJIRO ---
I am no nightingale,
But my song of her
Could outsing the sea.
America.
--- KAYAMA ---
Dawn flickering,
Tracing shadows of the pines
On my lady sleeping.
Your turn.
--- MANJIRO ---
Dawn brightening
As she opens up her eyes,
But it's I who come awake.
Your turn.
--- KAYAMA ---
You go.
--- MANJIRO ---
Your turn.
--- BOTH ---
Leaves,
I love her like the leaves,
Changing green to pink to gold,
And the change is everything.
--- Unknown ---
Sun,
I see her like the sun
In the center of a pool,
Sending ripples to the shore,
Till my journey's end.
--- MANJIRO ---
Your turn.
--- KAYAMA ---
Rain.
--- MANJIRO ---
Haze.
--- KAYAMA ---
Moon.
--- MANJIRO ---
Wind.
--- KAYAMA ---
Nightingale.
--- MANJIRO ---
Dawn.
--- KAYAMA ---
Leaves.
--- MANJIRO ---
Sun.
--- BOTH ---
