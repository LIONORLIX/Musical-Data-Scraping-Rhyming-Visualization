------ Welcome to Kanagawa ------
--- MADAM ---
I own a small commercial venture
With a modest clientele
In Kanagawa.
--- GIRLS ---
I think I see one over there behind the trees!
--- MADAM ---
Sh!
It's been my family's for centur-
Ies and doing very well ?
For Kanagawa.
--- GIRLS ---
I hear they're covered all with hair, like some disease.
--- MADAM ---
Sh!
--- FOURTH GIRL ---
Except their knees.
--- MADAM ---
Sh!
The arrival of these giants
Out of the blue,
Bringing panic to my clients,
Alters my view.
With so many of them fleeing,
Conferring, decreeing,
I find myself agreeing
With the ancient haiku:
--- RECITER ---
The nest-building bird,
Seeking the tree without twigs,
Looks for new forests.
--- MADAM ---
Exactly.
Welcome to Kanagawa.
--- GIRLS ---
Welcome to Kanagawa!
--- MADAM ---
No ?
Welcome to Kanagawa.
--- GIRLS ---
Oh ?
Welcome to Kanagawa.
--- MADAM ---
So ?
With all my flowers disappearing
In alarm,
I've been reduced to commandeering
From the farm.
But with appropriate veneering,
Even green wood has its charm.
--- GIRLS ---
Yo-ho!
Yo-ho!
--- MADAM ---
Yo-ho!
That you'll have to bend for ?
Can yo see why?
--- FIRST GIRL ---
Yo-ho!
--- MADAM ---
That you'll need a friend for ?
Still, you might try.
--- SECOND GIRL ---
Yo-ho!
--- MADAM ---
That you do through the kimono ?
Not very much.
--- THIRD GIRL ---
Yo-ho!
--- MADAM ---
That you use glue, then you ?
No, no, no, no,
Those you don't touch!
--- ALL ---
Welcome to Kanagawa,
Music and food for twenty yen ?
Music and food ?
--- MADAM ---
And maybe then ?
--- ALL ---
Welcome!
--- Unknown ---
Welcome to Kanagawa!
Music and food and company!
Music and food ?
--- MADAM ---
? And for a fee ?
--- ALL ---
Welcome!
--- MADAM ---
When a country is in trouble,
Choices are few.
And apart from charging double,
What can you do?
With my clients off defending,
And strangers descending,
I find myself depending
On the ancient haiku:
--- RECITER ---
The bird from the sea,
Not knowing pine from bamboo,
Roosts on anything.
--- MADAM ---
Exactly.
--- GIRLS ---
Welcome to Kanagawa!
--- MADAM ---
Glow!
--- GIRLS ---
Welcome to Kanagawa!
--- MADAM ---
Low!
--- GIRLS ---
Welcome to Kanagawa!
--- MADAM ---
Grow!
--- GIRLS ---
Welcome to Kanagawa!
--- MADAM ---
Go!
--- Unknown ---
(as they all move into the "forest")
GIRLS
Yo-ho!
Yo-ho!
--- MADAM ---
Yo-ho! ?
