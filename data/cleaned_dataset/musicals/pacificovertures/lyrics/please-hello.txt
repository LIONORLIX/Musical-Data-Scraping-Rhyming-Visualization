Port for commercial intention,
Harbor with ample dimension.

Little port
For a freighter.

Just for fun,
Be a sport.

A machine

Hello, I come with letters from Her Majesty Victoria
Who, learning how you're trading now, sang Hallelujah, Gloria!
And sent me to convey to you her positive euphoria
As well as little gifts from Britain's various emporia.
--- ABE ---
Tea?
--- BRITISH ADMIRAL ---
For drink.
--- ABE ---
I see.
I thank you
--- BRITISH ADMIRAL ---
I think
Her letters do contain a few proposals to your Emperor
Which if, of course, he won't endorse, will put in her in a temper or,
More happily, should he agree, will serve to keep her placid, or
At least till I am followed by a permanent ambassador.
--- RECITER ---
A treaty port and, from the court, a permanent ambassador.
A treaty port and, from the court, a permanent ambassador.
A treaty port and, from the court, a permanent ambassador
And more.
--- BRITISH ADMIRAL ---
Her Majesty considers the arrangements to be tentative
Until we ship a proper diplomatic representative.
We don't foresee that you will be the least bit argumentative,
So please ignore the man-of-war we brought as a preventative.
--- Unknown ---
(explosion)
--- RECITER ---
Yes, please ignore the man-of-war
That's anchored rather near the shore,
It's nothing but a metaphor
That acts as a preventative.
--- Unknown ---
(explosion)
--- BRITISH ADMIRAL ---
All clear?
Just so.
Sign here.
--- AMERICAN ADMIRAL ---
Hello, hello, objection resent!
President Pierce say Moment's pause.
British get ambassador sent,
President Pierce get extra clause.
--- DUTCH ADMIRAL ---
Wait! Please hello!
Don't forget the Dutch!
Like to keep in touch!
Thank you very much!
Tell them to go,
Button up the lips.
What do little Nips
Want with battleships?
--- Unknown ---
Hold everything!

Chocolate!
Wouldn' you like to lease
A beautiful little piece
Of chocolate?
Listen, that's not to mention
Wonderful ? pay attention! ?
Windmills
Und tulips,
Und wouldn' you like a wooden shoe?
There ? can you read?
Good! We will need
Two ports,
One of them not to rocky
How about Nagasaki?
Two ports,
One of them for the cocoa
What do you call it? ? Yoko
Hama! Ja!
Und Nagasaki! Ja!
Sign here!
--- AMERICAN ADMIRAL ---
Wait please, objection again!
Dutch getting to many seaports.
President now wanting three ports
--- BRITISH ADMIRAL ---
Great Britain wishes her position clear and indisputable:
We're not amused at being used and therefore stand immutable.
And though you Japs are foxy chaps and damnably inscrutable ?
--- RUSSIAN ADMIRAL ---
Please hello ?
--- DUTCH ADMIRAL ---
Wait please hello!
Comes the monkey wrench!
Smell that awful stench:
Probably the French.
--- AMERICAN ADMIRAL ---
? Also insist giving free ports ?
--- BRITISH ADMIRAL ---
? Reviewing it from where we sit, the facts are irrefutable ?
--- RUSSIAN ADMIRAL ---
Please hello ?
--- DUTCH ADMIRAL ---
Ach, nein, of course,
My mistake, the Czar.
Smell the caviar ?
Leave the door ajar.
--- AMERICAN ADMIRAL ---
? Also want annual reports ?
--- BRITISH ADMIRAL ---
? And thus, in short, a single port is patently unsuitable!
--- RUSSIAN ADMIRAL ---
Please hello,
Is bringing Czar's request,
Braving snow
With letter to protest:
Since we know
You trading with the West,
You might at least
Start looking East ?
? Or closer West ?
? Well, farther North ?
Are we the fourth?
I feel depressed.
--- Unknown ---
Coming next
Is extraterritoriality.
Noting text
Say extraterritoriality.
You perplexed
By extraterritoriality?
Just noting clause
Which say your laws
Do not apply
When we drop by ?
Not getting shot,
No matter what:
A minor scrape,
A major rape,
And we escape
That's what is extraterritoriality.
--- Unknown ---
Fair is fair ?
You wish to vote?
What we care
You liking what we wrote?
Sitting there
Is finest fleet afloat.
Observing boat?
Don't touch the coat.
Just sign the note.
--- BRITISH ADMIRAL ---
The British feel these latest dealings verge on immorality.
The element of precedent imperils our neutrality.
We're rather vexed, your giving extraterritoriality.
We must insist you offer this to every nationality!
--- DUTCH ADMIRAL ---
We want the same
What the Russkies claim!
Why you let them came?
Dirty rotten shame!
--- AMERICAN ADMIRAL ---
U.S.A. extremely upset!
President Pierce say solid No!
--- FRENCH ADMIRAL ---
'Allo! ?
Please 'allo!
Please 'allo!
'Allo! 'Allo! 'Allo!

When you're always busy making wiz ze
Mutual d?tente!
A d?tente! A d?tente
Is ze only thing we wish!
Same as zem, except additional
Ze rights to fish!
You'll be paid, you'll be paid
And we'll 'ave ze big parade
If we somehow can persuade
You to accept our aid.
It is not to be afraid ?
As we merely wish to trade ?
A d?tente! Oui, d?tente!
Zat's ze only thing we want!
Leave ze grain, leave ze train,
Put champagne among your imports!
Tell each man zat Japan

--- ABE ---
It is late,
And I fear ?
Well, you see,

(Everybody sings simultaneously, squabbling with each other.)
--- ABE ---

Er, I fear.
There's a drought
And a famine ?

For a year,
Then no doubt
We'll examine
It, but we've
Had a quake
And a flood
And a famine ?
Please believe

Y, examine

Zere's no time for making warfare.
Why discuss, make ze fuss,
Since ze West belongs to us?
And ze East we have leased for ze French administration.
If you want force in ze Norce,
Zen we burn ze Dutch legation.
--- DUTCH ADMIRAL ---
Wait please hello!
Don't forget the Dutch!
We want just as much
Fishing rights and such!
Tell them to go,
Otherwise we post
Battleships at most
Ports along the coast.
You can have the West,
We will take the rest.
--- BRITISH ADMIRAL ---
One moment, please, I think that these assure us exclusivity
For Western ports and other sorts of maritime activity,
And if you mean to intervene, as is the Dutch proclivity,
We'll blow you nits to little bits, with suitable festivity.
--- AMERICAN ADMIRAL ---
Wait please, hello, West is ours.
Wait please, the East is the best coast.
We'll trade you two on the West coast.
--- RUSSIAN ADMIRAL ---
Please hello, no seaports on the West.
United States too near to Czar,
Is tempting fates, is go too far ?
--- ALL THE ADMIRALS ---
Ah, d?tentes! Ah, d?tentes!
They're what everybody wants!
You should want a d?tente ?
Makes a nation like a brother!
We'll be here every year
To protect you from each other
And to see you aren't
Signing foreign
Treaties and d?tentes!
--- Unknown ---
Please hello! We must go,
But our intercourse will grow
Through d?tente, as d?tente
Brings complete cooperation.
By the way, we must say
We adore your little nation,
And with heavy cannon
Wish you an un-
