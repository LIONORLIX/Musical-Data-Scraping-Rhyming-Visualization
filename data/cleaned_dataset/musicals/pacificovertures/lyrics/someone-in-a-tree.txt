------ Someone in a Tree ------
--- OLD MAN ---
Pardon me, I was there.
--- RECITER ---
You were where?
--- OLD MAN ---
At the treaty house.
--- RECITER ---
At the treaty house?
--- OLD MAN ---
There was a tree ?
--- RECITER ---
Which was where?
--- OLD MAN ---
Very near.
--- RECITER ---
Over here?
--- OLD MAN ---
Maybe over there,
But there were trees then, everywhere.
May I show you?
--- RECITER ---
If you please.
--- OLD MAN ---
There were trees
Then, everywhere.
--- RECITER ---
But you were there.
--- OLD MAN ---
And I was there!
Let me show you.
--- RECITER ---
If you please.
--- OLD MAN ---
I was younger then ?
I was good at climbing trees ?
I was younger then ?
I saw everything! ?
I was hidden all the time ?
It was easier to climb ?
I was younger then ?
I saw everything! ?
Where they came and where they went ?
I was part of the event.
I was someone in a tree!
I was younger then!
--- Unknown ---
(Suddenly, a Young Boy appears, scurries across the stage, and up the tree.)
--- BOY ---
Tell him what I see!
--- OLD MAN ---
I am in a tree.
I am ten.
I am in a tree.
--- BOY ---
I was younger then.
--- OLD MAN ---
In between the eaves I can see ?
Tell me what I see.
I was only ten.
--- BOY ---
I see men and matting.
Some are old, some chatting.
--- OLD MAN ---
If it happened, I was there!
--- BOTH ---
I saw/see everything!
--- OLD MAN ---
I was someone in a tree.
--- BOY ---
Tell him what I see!
--- OLD MAN ---
Some of them have gold on their coats.
--- BOY ---
One of them has gold.
He was younger then.
--- OLD MAN ---
Someone crawls around passing notes ?
--- BOY ---
Someone very old ?
--- OLD MAN ---
He was only ten.
--- BOY ---
And there's someone in a tree ?
--- OLD MAN ---
? Or the day is incomplete.
--- BOTH ---
Without someone in a tree,
Nothing happened here.
--- OLD MAN ---
I am hiding in a tree.
--- BOY ---
I'm a fragment of the day.
--- BOTH ---
If I weren't, who's to say
Things would happen here the way
That they happened here?
--- OLD MAN ---
I was there then.
--- BOY ---
I am here still.
It's the fragment, not the day.
--- OLD MAN ---
It's the pebble, not the stream.
--- BOTH ---
It's the ripple, not the sea.
Not the building but the beam,
Not the garden but the stone,
Not the treaty house,
Someone in a tree.
--- WARRIOR ---
Pardon me, I am here ?
If you please, I am also here ?
--- OLD MAN ---
They kept drinking cups of tea.
--- BOY ---
They kept sitting on the floor.
--- BOTH ---
They drank many cups of tea.
No, we told him that before.
--- WARRIOR ---
If you please, I am here.
--- RECITER ---
You are where?
--- WARRIOR ---
In the treaty house.
--- RECITER ---
In the treaty house?
--- WARRIOR ---
Or very near.
--- RECITER ---
Can you hear?
--- WARRIOR ---
I'm below.
--- RECITER ---
So I notice.
--- WARRIOR ---
Underneath the floor,
And so I can't see anything.
I can hear them,
But I can't see anything.
--- RECITER ---
But you can hear?
--- WARRIOR ---
But I can hear.
Shall I listen?
--- RECITER ---
If you please.
--- WARRIOR ---
I can hear them now ?
I shall try to shift my knees ?
I can hear them now ?
I hear everything ?
I'm the part that's underneath,
With my sword inside my sheath.
I can hear them now ?
One is over me ?
If they knock, then I appear.
I'm a part of what I hear.
I'm the fragment underneath.
I can hear them now!
--- RECITER, OLD MAN, BOY ---
Tell us what you hear!
--- WARRIOR ---
First I hear a creak and a thump.
Now I hear a clink ?
Then they talk a bit ?
Many times they shout when they speak.
Other times they think.
Or they argue it ?
I hear floorboards groaning ?
Angry growls ? Much droning ?
Since I hear them, they are there,
As they argue it.
I'm the listener underneath.
--- BOY ---
Someone reads a list
From a box.
--- WARRIOR ---
Someone talks of laws.
--- OLD MAN ---
Then they fan a bit.
--- BOY ---
Someone bangs a fist.
--- WARRIOR ---
Someone knocks.
--- OLD MAN ---
Now there was a pause.
--- ALL ---
Then they argue it:
--- WARRIOR ---
But we want ?
No, you can't
And we won't ?
But we need it,
And we want ?
Will you grant ? ?
If you don't ?
We concede it ?
--- OLD MAN WARRIOR ---
And they sat I can hear
Through the night Them.
And they lit
Yellow tapers. BOY
I was I'm a And they
There Fragment of the Chat
Then. Day. And they fight
And they sit
Signing papers.
If I If I I am
Weren't, who's to Weren't, who's to There
Say Say Still.
Things would Things would If I
Happen here the Happen here the Weren't who's to
Way Way Say
That they're That they're That they're
Happening? Happening? Happening?
--- ALL ---
It's the fragment, not the day.
It's the pebble, not the stream.
It's the ripple, not the sea
That is happening.
Not the building but the beam,
Not the garden but the stone,
Only cups of tea
And history
