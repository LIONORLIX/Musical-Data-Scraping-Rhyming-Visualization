------ Pretty Lady ------
--- SAILOR III ---
Pretty lady in the pretty garden, can't you stay?
Pretty lady, we got leave and we got paid today.
Pretty lady with a flower,
Give a lonely sailor 'alf an hour.
Pretty lady, can you understand a word I say?
Don't go away.
--- SAILOR I ---
Pretty lady, you're the cleanest thing I've seen all year.
Pretty lady, you're enough to make me glad I'm here.
--- SAILOR II ---
Pretty lady, could I hear you laugh?
I ain't heard a lady laugh for I don't know how long.
I'll sing a song for you,
Tell you tales of adventuring, strange and fantastical.
Pretty lady, I ain't never been away from home.
Pretty lady, beg your pardon,
Won't you walk me through your pretty garden?
--- SAILOR III ---
Pretty lady, I'm a million miles from Stepney Green.
You are the softest thing I ever seen.
Stay with me please, I been away so long.
Don't be afraid ? Hey,
No, listen, pretty lady, beg your pardon,
Won't you walk me through your pretty garden?
--- SAILOR I ---
Pretty lady, how about it?
Don't you know how long I been without it?
Pretty lady in the garden, what you say?
Can't you stay? ? Hey. wait, don't go yet.
Pretty lady with the pretty bow,
Please don't go, it's early.
Won't you walk me through your pretty garden?
--- ALL SAILORS ---
Pretty lady, look, I'm on my knees,
Pretty please.

Pretty lady with a flower,

Give a lonely sailor 'alf an hour!
