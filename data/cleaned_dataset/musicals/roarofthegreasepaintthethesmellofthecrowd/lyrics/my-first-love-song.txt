------ My First Love Song ------
--- Unknown ---
My first love song -
This is my first love song;
But it takes a poet to make a rhyme.
--- Unknown ---
I'm not clever!
I could never ever
Think of phases worthy of you.
Each endeavor
I may make to sing your praises
May not sound as it should do.
--- Unknown ---
But I love you -
Please believe I love you -
And I'd love the way poets do - to
Bring my love song
And sing my love song to you.
--- Unknown ---
My first love song;
This is my first love song.
No one's ever needed my love before.
--- Unknown ---
You're like I am -
All alone like I am
And in need of someone to care.
--- Unknown ---
Poor like I am -
Like the lonely souls you read of,
You and I, we're a fine pair.
--- Unknown ---
If you love me
I really love you
As you say you love me
I really care for you, dear.
I will be so happy to see you
Bring your love song
And sing your love song to me.
--- Unknown ---
My first love song.
