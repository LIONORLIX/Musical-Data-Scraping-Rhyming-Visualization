------ The Joker ------
--- Unknown ---
There's always a joker in the pack -
There's always a cardboard clown.
The poor painted fool falls on his back
And ev'ryone laughs when he's down.
--- Unknown ---
There's always a funny man in the game;
But he's only funny by mistake;
But ev'ryone laughs at him just the same -
They don't see his painted heart break.
--- Unknown ---
They don't care as long as there is a jester -
Just a fool - as foolish as he can be.
There's always a joker, that's a rule
But Fate deals the hand and I see -
