------ Sweet Beginning / The Beautiful Land (Reprise) ------
--- Unknown ---
This, my friend, is only the beginning -
Such a sweet beginning, too.
Now, at last, I see a chance of winning -
See a chance of breaking through.
--- Unknown ---
Who can say? Today may live in hist'ry
As long as there's a hist'ry book.
Yesterday the world was still a myst'ry;
Today it has a new and diff'rent look.
--- Unknown ---
So, my friend, let's send the old world spinning;
Change is what I recommend.
Come on, my friend, let's see this sweet beginning
Through to the bitter end!
