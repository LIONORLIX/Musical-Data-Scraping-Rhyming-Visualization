------ My Way ------
--- Unknown ---
From now on, we're gonna do things my way.
My way, or not at all.
We're gonna do what I wanna to when I say
Not when you say, but when I say.
--- Unknown ---
And I say that my way is the sure way.
My way will work out fine;
And if you still prefer to do things your way,
You go your way and I'll go mine.
--- Unknown ---
From now on we're gonna do things my way!
No, we're not!
We're gonna do things my way
Or not at all!
If we leave it up to you we're gonna rue things
--- Unknown ---
We're gonna do what I wanna do
When I say!
I say!
Not when you say!
I say!
But when I say!
Now let me have my say:
--- Unknown ---
I say that my way is the sure way
We'd be better off to do things...
My way will work out fine
If we leave it up to you
You're gonna screw things
--- Unknown ---
If you'd still prefer to do things your way
I would
Then you go your way
Good.
And I'll go mine.
Good, and I'll go mine.
Good, and I'll go mine.
--- Now, let me have my say ---
From now on we're gonna see some changes;
Changes - that's what we need!
I'm gonna play what I wanna play when I say -
Not when you say - but when I say.
--- Unknown ---
And I say that your game is a sly game.
Your game could lead to wars;
And if you're not prepared to play at my game,
Then I'll pay my game.
And you play yours!
And you play yours!
And you play yours!
And you play yours!
