------ It Isn't Enough ------
--- Unknown ---
It isn't enough to hope.
It isn't enough to dream
It isn't enough to plot and plan and scheme.
--- Unknown ---
It isn't enough to stand here,
Saying that life is grand here,
Waiting for something good to turn up.
--- Unknown ---
It isn't enough to sit here,
Having a purple fit here,
Worried to death the world will burn up.
--- Unknown ---
It isn't enough to hope.
It isn't enough to dream.
I've got a better answer.
I've got a better scheme.
--- Unknown ---
Why not wish upon a wishbone,
Pick a four-leaf clover,
Rub a rabbit's foot and
Throw a horse shoe over
Your lucky shoulder?
--- Unknown ---
You'll find before you're very much older
A bit of luck will come your way.
