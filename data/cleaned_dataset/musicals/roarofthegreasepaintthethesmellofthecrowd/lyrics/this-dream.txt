------ This Dream ------
--- Unknown ---
This dream -
I have this wonderful dream where I win -
Where I win ev'ry battle I fight,
And I kill ev'ry dragon in sight.
--- Unknown ---
Each night I lie awake
And I wait for this dream.
What a world I create when I dream
I'm not lonely -
A pity it's only a dream;
--- Unknown ---
But such a fabulous dream
That I feel
That the real world is really unreal,
While the wildest of dreams
Can come true. They do;
