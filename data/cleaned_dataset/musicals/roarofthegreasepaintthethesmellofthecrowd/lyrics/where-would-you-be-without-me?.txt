------ Where Would You Be Without Me? ------
--- Unknown ---
Where would you be without me, Cocky,
Just tell me, where would you be?
Look at yourself - you are so dreary -
Oh dearie, oh me!
--- Unknown ---
How could you cope without my friendship
And my kindly old face?
Don't you know money can't buy friendship?
It's so hard to replace...money.
--- Unknown ---
Where would you be without my courage?
I am as fearless as three.
Faithful, if you should flag,
Strong if you start to sag.
Cocky, you've got to agree.
Tell me, frankly,
Where would you be without me?
--- Unknown ---
I dunno, Sir. The trouble with you, Sir, is you're too good to me.
I don't deserve the way you treat me.
Oh, Cocky!
No, really:
--- Unknown ---
Where would I be without you, Guv'nor?
Gawd only knows where I'd be!
Look at my life - it has no magic!
It's tragic to see!
--- Unknown ---
I mean I couldn't live without your friendship
And your expert advice.
Yours is a lasting and sure friendship
And what's more - you're so nice!
Aren't I?
--- Unknown ---
Where would I be without your goodness
Helping to carry me through?
People just pass me by;
Whether I live or die,
They wouldn't care -
But I do!
--- Unknown ---
Tell me, frankly,
Where would I be -
Where would you be?
Where would I be
Without you?
--- Unknown ---
Where would I be without you, Guv'nor?
You've got no style -
You've got no class -
Without me, you'd be on your...
Ask yourself, Sir, just where would I be?
You can scarcely read or write or spell.
For my part, you can go to...
--- Unknown ---
Well, Sir,
I try to do my best.
Cockius useless est.
Know what that means, you pest?
No!
Hah! There, you see? Frankly,
--- Unknown ---
Where would you be?
I'd be up a tree.
And what would you do?
I'd throw things at you!
--- Unknown ---
You're up a tree without...
Can't picture me without...
Where would you be without me?
