------ Who Can I Turn To (When Nobody Needs Me) ------
--- Unknown ---
Who can I turn to
When nobody needs me?
My heart wants to know
And so I must go
Where destiny leads me.
--- Unknown ---
With no star to guide me
And no one beside me,
I'll go on my way
And after the day
The darkness will hide me.
--- Unknown ---
And maybe tomorrow
I'll find what I'm after.
I'll throw off my sorrow -
Beg, steal or borrow
My share of laughter.
--- Unknown ---
With you I could learn to;
With you on a new day.
But who can I turn to
