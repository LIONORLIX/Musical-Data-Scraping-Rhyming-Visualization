------ Put It In The Book ------
--- Unknown ---
Put it in the book!
Jump about a bit!
Put it in the book for me!
Put it in the book!
Don't get out of it.
Mustn't cook the book, tee hee.
--- Unknown ---
Put it in the book!
Put it in the book!
Put it in the book!
And do it nicely.
Put it in the book!
You're a bit of a crook!
To put it precisely!
--- Unknown ---
Put it in the book!
When it's in the book,
Let us have a look - let's see!
Now it's in the book
And the job is done.
Cor, you are a one - two, three.

Put it in the book!
Put it in the book!
Put it in the book!
Put it in the book!
