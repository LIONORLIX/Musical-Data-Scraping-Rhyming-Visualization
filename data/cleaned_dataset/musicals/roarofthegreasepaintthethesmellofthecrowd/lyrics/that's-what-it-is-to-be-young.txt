------ That's What It Is To Be Young ------
--- Unknown ---
And now poor Bertie's dead
And his requiem's been sung
We must admit we're bloody glad
To be alive and young. Alive and young.
--- Unknown ---
Fresh as an April morning,
Soft as a tulip's tongue,
Clear as the gleam of a mountain stream;
That's what it is to be young.
--- Unknown ---
Warm as a summer sunrise,
Sweet as an evening breeze,
Pure as a note from a songbird's throat,
Rich as the green of the trees,
--- Unknown ---
Strong as the bite of a frosty night,
Bold as a big brass band,
Keen as a bean or a young sardine --
Not very keen to be canned,
--- Unknown ---
Bright as a newborn bluebell,
New as a song unsung,
Free as the breeze on the seven seas;
