------ On the Road ------
--- Unknown ---
JOE's car noses into one of the main boulevards near Paramount;
but the FINANCEMEN come roaring up in pursuit.
JOE hits the gas and a high-speed chase ensues.
Finally, after a hair-raising dash through the Holmby Hills,
JOE's car turns onto Sunset, gains some distance with an enterprising U-turn
and then suffers a sudden blow-out. With some difficulty,
JOE manages to control the car and turns into an open driveway,
which then curves away from the street
