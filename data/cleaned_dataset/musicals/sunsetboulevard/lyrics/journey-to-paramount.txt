------ Journey To Paramount ------
--- NORMA ---
There's been a call
What did I say
They want to see me right away
Joe, Paramount, they love our child
Mr. DeMille is going wild
--- JOE ---
Well, that's wonderful, Norma.
--- NORMA ---
But it was some fool assistant
Not acceptable at all
It he wants me, then Cecil B.
Himself must call
--- JOE ---
I don't know if this is the time to stand on ceremony.
--- NORMA ---
I've been waiting twenty years now
What's a few more days, my dear?
It's happened, Joe
I told you so
The perfect year
--- Unknown ---
Now, let's go upstairs
--- JOE ---
Shouldn't you at least call back?
--- NORMA ---
No; they can wait until I'm good and ready.
--- Unknown ---
JOE (V.O.)
It took her three days and she was ready
She checked with her astrologer
Who sacrificed a chicken
She dressed up like a pharaoh
Slapped on a pound of make-up
And set forth in her chariot
Poor Norma
So happy
Re-entering her kingdom
--- Unknown ---
MAX (V.O.)
If you will pardon me, Madame, the shadow over the left eye is not quite balanced.
--- Unknown ---
NORMA (V.O.)
Thank you, Max.
--- GUARD ---
Hey, that's enough of that.
--- MAX ---
To see Mr. DeMille. Open the gate.
--- GUARD ---
Mr. DeMille is shooting. You need an appointment.
--- MAX ---
This is Norma Desmond. No appointment is necessary.
--- GUARD ---
Norma who?
--- NORMA ---
Jonesy?
--- JONES ---
Why, if it isn't Miss Desmond. How have you been, Miss Desmond?
--- NORMA ---
Fine, Jonesy. Open the gate.
--- JONES ---
You heard Miss Desmond.
--- GUARD ---
They don't have a pass.
--- JONES ---
Stage 18, Miss Desmond.
--- NORMA ---
Thank you, Jonesy. And teach your friend some manners.
Tell him without me, there wouldn't be any Paramount Studio.
--- JONES ---
Get me Stage 18. I have a message for Mr. DeMille.
--- HEATHER ---
Mr. DeMille?
--- DEMILLE ---
What is it?
--- HEATHER ---
Norma Desmond is here to see you, Mr. DeMille.
--- DEMILLE ---
Norma Desmond?
--- HEATHER ---
She's here at the studio.
--- DEMILLE ---
It must be about that appalling script of hers. What shall I say?
--- HEATHER ---
Maybe I could give her the brush.
--- DEMILLE ---
Thirty million fans have given her the brush. Isn't that enough? Give me a minute.
--- NORMA ---
Won't you come along, darling?
--- JOE ---
It's your script. It's your show. Good luck.
--- NORMA ---
Thank you, darling.
--- HEATHER ---
Miss Desmond.
--- DEMILLE ---
Well, well, well.
--- NORMA ---
Hello, Mr. DeMille.
The last time I saw you, we were someplace terribly gay. I was dancing on the table.
--- DEMILLE ---
A lot of people were. Lindbergh had just landed.
--- NORMA ---
You read the script, of course.
--- DEMILLE ---
Well, yes...
--- NORMA ---
Now, I know how busy you are during shooting,
but I really think you could have picked up the phone yourself,
instead of leaving it so some assistant.
--- DEMILLE ---
I don't know what you mean, Norma.
--- NORMA ---
Yes, you do.
--- DEMILLE ---
