------ Too Much In Love To Care ------
--- BETTY ---
When I was a kid, I played on this street
I always loved illusion
I thought make-believe was truer than life
But now it's all confusion
Please, can you tell me what's happening?
I just don't know anymore
If this is real, how should I feel?
What should I look for?

If you were smart, you would keep on walking
Out of my life as fast as you can
I'm not the one you should pin your hopes on
You're falling for the wrong kind of man
This is crazy! You know we should call it a day
Sound advice, great advice
Let's throw it away
--- Unknown ---
I can't control all the things I'm feeling
I haven't got a prayer
If I'm a fool, well
I'm too much in love to care
--- Unknown ---
I knew where I was, I'd given up hope
Made friends with disillusion
No one in my life, but I look at you
And now it's all confusion
--- BETTY ---
Please, can you tell me what's happening?
I just don't know anymore
If this is real, how should I feel?
What should I look for?
--- Unknown ---
I thought I had everything I needed
My life was set, my dreams were in place
My heart could see way into the future
All of that goes when I see your face
--- Unknown ---
I should hate you
There I was, the world in my hand
Can one kiss, kiss away
Everything I planned?
--- Unknown ---
I can't control all the things I'm feeling
I'm floating in mid-air
I know it's wrong, but,
I'm too much in love to care

Great advice

Let's throw it away...
I can't control all the things I'm feeling
We're floating in mid-air
If we are fools, well,
We're too much in love to care
If we are fools, well,
