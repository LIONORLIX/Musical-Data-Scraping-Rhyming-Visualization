------ New Ways To Dream (Reprise) ------
--- JOE ---
What's the matter there, Max? You waiting to wash the car?
--- MAX ---
Please be careful when you cross the patio. Madame may be watching.
--- JOE ---
Suppose I tiptoe up the back stairs and get undressed in the dark, will that do it?
--- MAX ---
It's just that I am greatly worried about Madame.
--- JOE ---
Well, we're not helping any, feeling her lies, more lies.
What's going to happen when she finds out they're not going to make her picture?
--- MAX ---
She never will. That is my job.
I made her a star and I will never let her be destroyed.
--- JOE ---
You made her a star?
--- MAX ---
I directed all her early pictures. In those days,
there were three young directors who showed promise: D.W. Griffith, Cecil B. DeMille and --
--- JOE ---
Max von Mayerling.
--- MAX ---
That's right.
--- Unknown ---
When we met, she was a child
Barely sixteen
Awkward and yet, she had an air
I've never seen
I knew I'd found my perfect face
Deep in her eyes
New ways to dream
And we inspired
New ways to dream
--- Unknown ---
Talkies came; I stayed with her, took up this life
Threw away fame
Please understand
She was my wife
--- Unknown ---
We had achieved far more than most
We gave the world new ways to dream
Everyone needs new ways to dream
--- JOE ---
Are you saying you were married to her?
--- MAX ---
I was the first husband.
--- Unknown ---
So I play this game
Keeper of the flame
Sharing with her one last dream
Don't you think I knew it never could come true?
She'll be the very last one to surrender
