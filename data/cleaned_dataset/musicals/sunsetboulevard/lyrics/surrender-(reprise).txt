------ Surrender (Reprise) ------
--- BETTY ---
Well, Hello Mr. Gillis
Where have you been keeping yourself?
--- JOE ---
Someone's been doing it for me
--- BETTY ---
And meanwhile Blind Windows
Is stuck on the shelf
You said we'd work together
--- JOE ---
New Year's crisis, what can I say?
--- BETTY ---
Always full of excuses
--- JOE ---
Promise I'll call you later today
--- BETTY ---
You said that last time.
--- JOE ---
Look, Betty, I won't let you down.
--- BETTY ---
I guess I'll just have to trust you.
--- SHELDRAKE ---
You're Miss Desmond's German Shepherd?
I'm the one who's been calling
--- Unknown ---
The name is Sheldrake. A couple of weeks ago,
I was looking out my office window, I saw you drive onto the lot.
And I said, that's exactly the car I've been looking for.
Great for my new Crosby picture. So, I made a few inquiries. I've been calling for two weeks.
Doesn't she ever pick up the phone? You know, outside a museum, you don't see
that kind of quality anymore. We're willing to pay, at least a hundred dollars a week...
--- MAX ---
It's outrageous
You insult her
How can you be so cruel?
I forbid you to approach her
--- SHELDRAKE ---
You're insane
--- MAX ---
Go away.
Go away!
--- NORMA ---
Did you see how they all came
Crowding around?
They still love me, and soon we'll be
Breaking new ground
Brave pioneers
--- DEMILLE ---
Those were the days
--- NORMA ---
Just like before
--- DEMILLE ---
We had such fun
--- NORMA ---
We gave the world
New ways to dream
--- BOTH ---
We always found new ways to dream
--- DEMILLE ---
Let's have a good long talk one day.
--- NORMA ---
The old team will be back in business
--- DEMILLE ---
Sorry, my next shot's ready
--- MAX ---
Mr. Gillis...
--- JOE ---
What's the matter, Max?
--- MAX ---
I just found out the reason for all those phone calls from Paramount.
It's not Madame they want. It's her car.
--- JOE ---
Oh, my God.
--- NORMA ---
Now, you remember, don't you? I don't work before 10 or after 4:30 in the afternoon.
--- DEMILLE ---
It isn't entirely my decision, Norma. New York must be consulted.
--- NORMA ---
That's fine. Ask any exhibitor in the country. I'm not forgotten.
--- DEMILLE ---
Of course you're not.
Goodbye, young fellow. We'll what we can do.
--- NORMA ---
I'm not worried. It's so wonderful to be back.
--- BETTY ---
Was that really Norma Desmond?
--- DEMILLE ---
It was.
--- HEATHER ---
She must be about a million years old.
--- DEMILLE ---
I hate to think where that puts me. I could be her father.
--- HEATHER ---
Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. DeMille.
--- DEMILLE ---
If you could have seen
Her at seventeen
When all of her dreams were new
Beautiful and strong
Before it all went wrong
She's never known the meaning of surrender
