------ Completion Of The Script ------
--- JOE ---
In December, the rains came. One great big package, over-sized,
just like everything else in California;
and it came right through the roof of my room above the garage.
So she had me moved into the main house.
Into what Max called the room of the husbands.
And on a clear day, the theory was, you could see Catalina.
And little by little I worked through to the end of the script.
At which point I might have left:
only by then those two boys from the finance company had traced my car and towed it away,
and I hadn't seen one single dollar of cash money since I arrived.
--- NORMA ---
Stop that!
Today's the day.
--- JOE ---
What do you mean?
--- NORMA ---
Max is going to deliver the script to Paramount.
--- JOE ---
You're really going to give it to DeMille?
--- NORMA ---
I've just spoken with my astrologer. She read DeMille's horoscope; she read mine.
--- JOE ---
Did she read the script?
--- NORMA ---
DeMille is Leo; I'm Scorpio.
Mars is transiting Jupiter and today is the day of closest conjunction.
--- JOE ---
Oh well, that's all right, then.
--- NORMA ---
Max.
--- MAX ---
Yes, Madame.
--- NORMA ---
Make sure it goes to Mr. DeMille in person.
--- JOE ---
Well...
--- NORMA ---
Great day.
--- JOE ---
It's been real interesting.
--- NORMA ---
Yes...hasn't it?
--- JOE ---
I want to thank you for trusting me with your baby.
--- NORMA ---
Not at all, it is I who should thank you.
--- JOE ---
Will you call and let me know as soon as you have some news?
--- NORMA ---
Call? Where?
--- JOE ---
My apartment.
--- NORMA ---
Oh, but you couldn't possibly think of leaving now, Joe.
--- JOE ---
Norma, the script is finished.
--- NORMA ---
No, Joe. No. It's just the beginning, it's just the firt draft.
I couldn't dream of letting you go, I need your support.
--- JOE ---
Well, I can't stay.
--- NORMA ---
You'll stay on with full salary, of course...
--- JOE ---
Oh, Norma, it's not the money
Yes, of course, I'll stay until we get some sort of news back from Paramount.
--- NORMA ---
Thank you. Thank you, Joe.
--- JOE ---
So, Max wheeled out that foreign bus
Brushed the leopardskin upholstery
He trundled along to Paramount
To hand Cecil B. our hopeless opus
My work was over
I was feeling no pain
