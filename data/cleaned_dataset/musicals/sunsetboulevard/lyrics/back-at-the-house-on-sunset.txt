------ Back At The House On Sunset ------
--- MAX ---
Where have you been?
--- JOE ---
Out. I assume I can go out when I feel like it.
--- MAX ---
Madame is quite agitated.
Earlier this evening, she wanted you for something and you could not be found.
--- JOE ---
Well, that's tough.
--- MAX ---
I don't think you understand, Mr. Gillis. Madame is extremely fragile.
She has moments of melancholy. There have been suicide attempts.
--- JOE ---
Why? Because of her career? She's done well enough.
Look at all the fan mail she gets every day.
--- MAX ---
I wouldn't look too closely at the postmarks if I were you.
--- JOE ---
You mean you write them?
--- MAX ---
Will you be requiring some supper this evening, sir?
--- JOE ---
No. And Max?
--- MAX ---
Yes, sir?
--- JOE ---
Who the hell do you think you are,
bringing my stuff up from my apartment without consulting me?
I have a life of my own - now you're telling me I'm supposed to be a prisoner here.
--- MAX ---
I think, perhaps, sir, you will have to make up your mind to abide by the rules of this house.
That is, if you want the job.
--- JOE ---
I started work on the script
I hacked my way through the thicket
A maze of fragmented ramblings
By a soul in limbo
She hovered there like a hawk
Afraid I'd damage her baby
--- NORMA ---
What's that?
--- JOE ---
I thought we might cut away from the slave market...
--- NORMA ---
Cut away from me?
--- JOE ---
Norma, they don't want you in every scene
--- NORMA ---
Or course they do. What else would they have come for?
Put it back.
--- JOE ---
I'd made my first big mistake
I'd put my foot in the quicksand
It wouldn't be a few days
Paste and scissors
This would take weeks
--- Unknown ---
The house was always so quiet
Just me and Max and that organ
No one phoned and nobody ever came
And there was only one kind
of entertainment on hand
--- Unknown ---
Max, what's on this evening?
I hope it's not one of her weepy melodramas
--- MAX ---
We'll be showing
One of Madam's enduring classics
The Ordeal of Joan of Arc
--- JOE ---
Oh, God.
We saw that last week.
--- MAX ---
A masterpiece can never pall
