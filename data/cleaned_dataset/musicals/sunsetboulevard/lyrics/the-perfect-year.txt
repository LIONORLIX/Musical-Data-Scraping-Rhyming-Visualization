------ The Perfect Year ------
--- NORMA ---
Ring out the old
Ring in the new
A midnight wish
To share with you
Your lips are warm
My head is light
Were we alive before tonight?
--- Unknown ---
I don't need a crowded ballroom
Everything I want is here
If you're with me
Next year will be
The perfect year
--- JOE ---
Before we play
Some dangerous game
Before we fan
Some harmless flame
We have to ask if this is wise
And if the game is worth the prize
--- Unknown ---
With this wine and with this music
How can anything be clear?
Let's wait and see
It may just be
The perfect year
--- NORMA ---
It's New Year's Eve
And hopes are high
Dance one year in
Kiss one goodbye
Another chance, another start
So many dreams to tease the heart
--- Unknown ---
We don't need a crowded ballroom
Everything we want is here
And face to face
We will embrace
The perfect year
--- Unknown ---
We don't need a crowded ballroom
Everything we want is here
And face to face
We will embrace
The perfect year
--- JOE ---
So, what time are they supposed to get here?
--- NORMA ---
Who?
--- JOE ---
The other guests.
--- NORMA ---
There are no other guests. Just you and me.
I'm in love with you. Surely you know that
--- JOE ---
Norma...
--- NORMA ---
We'll have a wonderful time next year. I'll have the pool filled up for you.
I'll open up my house in Malibu, and you can have the whole ocean.
I have enough money to buy us anything we want.
--- JOE ---
Cut out that us business.
--- NORMA ---
What's the matter with you?
--- JOE ---
What right do you have to take me for granted?
--- NORMA ---
What right? Do you want me to tell you?
--- JOE ---
Norma, what I am trying to say is that I am the wrong guy for you.
You need a big shot, someone with polo ponies, a Valentino...
--- NORMA ---
What you're trying to say is, you don't want me to love you. Say it! Say it!
--- JOE ---
Max. Get me a taxi.
--- Unknown ---
I had to get out
I needed to be with people my own age
To hear the sound of laughter
And mix with hungry actors
Underemployed composers
Nicotine-poisoned writers
Real people
Real problems
