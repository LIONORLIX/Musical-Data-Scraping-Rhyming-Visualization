------ The Lady's Paying ------
--- NORMA ---
Hurry up, the birthday boy is on his way
This is a surprise celebration
I hope you've remembered everything I've said
I want to see a total transformation
--- JOE ---
What's all this?
--- NORMA ---
Happy birthday, darling. Did you think we'd forgotten?
--- JOE ---
Well, I ... I don't know.
--- NORMA ---
These people are from the best men's shop in town. I had them close it down for the day.
--- JOE ---
Norma, now listen!
--- NORMA ---
I'll leave you boys to it.
--- MANFRED ---
Happy birthday, welcome to your shopathon!
--- JOE ---
What's going on?
--- MANFRED ---
Help yourself, it's all been taken care of
Anyone who's anyone is dressed by me
--- JOE ---
Well, golly gee
--- MANFRED ---
Pick out anything you'd like a pair of
You just point, I'll do the rest
I've brought nothing but the best
You're a very lucky writer
Come along now, get undressed
Unless I'm much mistaken
That's a 42-inch chest
--- JOE ---
I don't understand a word you're saying
--- MANFRED ---
Well, all you need to know's the lady's paying
It's nice to get your just reward this time of year
--- JOE ---
Get outta here!
--- MANFRED ---
And all my merchandise is strictly kosher
When you've thrown away all your old worn-out stuff
--- JOE ---
Hey, that's enough
--- MANFRED ---
Perhaps you'd like to model for my brochure
I have just the thing for you
Chalk-stripe suits
--- Unknown ---
SALESMAN 1
In black
--- Unknown ---
SALESMAN 2
Or blue
--- Unknown ---
SALESMAN 3
Glen plaid trousers
--- Unknown ---
SALESMAN 4
Cashmere sweaters
--- Unknown ---
SALESMAN 5

--- Unknown ---
SALESMAN 6
Here's a patent leather lace-up
--- Unknown ---
SALESMAN 7
It's a virtuoso shoe
--- MANFRED ---
And a simply marvelous coat made of vicuna
--- JOE ---
You know what you can do with your vicuna
--- NORMA ---
Come on Joe, you haven't even started yet
--- JOE ---
You wanna bet?
--- NORMA ---
I thought by now he'd look the height of fashion
He always takes forever making up his mind
Don't be unkind
I thought you writers knew about compassion
--- Unknown ---
I love flannel on a man
--- MANFRED ---
This will complement his tan
--- NORMA ---
We'll take two of these and four of those
--- MANFRED ---
I'm still your greatest fan!
Very soon now we'll have stopped him
Looking like an also-ran
--- JOE ---
You're going to make me sorry that I'm staying
--- NORMA ---
Well, all right, I'll choose, after all, I'm paying!
--- MANFRED ---
Evening clothes?
--- NORMA ---
I want to see your most deluxe
--- JOE ---
Won't wear a tux
--- NORMA ---
Of course not, dear, tuxedos are for waiters
--- MANFRED ---
What we need are tails, a white tie and top hat
--- JOE ---
I can't wear that
--- NORMA ---
Joe, second-rate clothes are for second-raters
--- JOE ---
Norma, please...
--- NORMA ---
Shut up, I'm rich
Now some platinum blonde bitch
I own so many apartments
I've forgotten which is which
--- JOE ---
I don't have to go to premieres
I'm never on display
You seem to forget that I'm a writer
Who cares what you wear when you're a writer?
--- NORMA ---
I care, Joe, and please don't be so mean to me.
--- JOE ---
O.K., all right.
--- NORMA ---
You can't come to my New Year's Eve party in that filling-station shirt.
--- JOE ---
I've been invited somewhere else on New Year's Eve.
--- NORMA ---
Where?
--- JOE ---
Artie Green. He's an old friend of mine.
--- NORMA ---
I can't do without you, Joe, I need you.
I've sent out every single invitation
--- JOE ---
All right, Norma, I give in
--- NORMA ---
Of course you do
And when they've dressed you
You'll cause a sensation
--- SALESMEN ---
We equip the chosen few of Movieland
--- MANFRED ---
--- SALESMEN ---
We dress every movie star and crooner
From their shiny toecaps to their hatband
--- MANFRED ---
You won't regret selecting the vicuna
--- SALESMEN ---
If you need a hand to shake
If there's a girl you want to make
If there's a soul you're out to capture
Or a heart you want to break
If you want the world to love you
--- MANFRED ---
You'll have to learn to take
--- SALESMEN ---
And gracefully accept the role you're playing
--- MANFRED ---
You will earn every cent the lady's paying
--- SALESMEN ---
So why not have it all?
--- MANFRED ---
Now that didn't hurt, did it?
--- SALESMEN ---
