------ Wonderful Guy ------
--- Nellie ---
I expect everyone of my crowd to make fun
Of my proud protestations of faith in romance,
And they'll say I'm naive as a babe to believe
Every fable I hear from a person in pants.
--- Unknown ---
Fearlessly I'll face them and argue their doubts away,
Loudly I'll sing about flowers in spring,
Flatly I'll stand on my little flat feet and say
Love is a grand and a beautiful thing!
I'm not ashamed to reveal
The world famous feelin' I feel.
--- Unknown ---
I'm as corny as Kansas in August,
I'm as normal as blueberry pie.
No more a smart little girl with no heart,
I have found me a wonderful guy!
--- Unknown ---
I am in a conventional dither,
With a conventional star in my eye.
And you will note there's a lump in my throat
When I speak of that wonderful guy!
--- Unknown ---
I'm as trite and as gay as a daisy in May,
A cliche' comin' true!
I'm bromidic and bright
As a moon-happy night
Pourin' light on the dew!
--- Unknown ---
I'm as corny as Kansas in August,
High as a flag on the Fourth of July!
If you'll excuse an expression I use,
I'm in love, I'm in love,
I'm in love, I'm in love,
I'm in love with a wonderful guy!

I'm as trite and as gay as a daisy in May,
A cliche' comin' true!
I'm bromidic and bright
As a moon-happy night
Pourin' light on the dew!
