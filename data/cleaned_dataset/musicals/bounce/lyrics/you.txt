--- Addison ---
Give them just an inch or so,
Till they feel fulfilled.
Ask a little quid pro quo--
Then you'll get your guild.
--- That's the way it has to go ---
Artists, yes, need patrons.
Patrons, though, need matrons
Yearning to be thrilled.
Wait and see the house I'm going to build.
--- Mrs. Stotesbury ---
Look at it!
--- Aristocrats ---
Oooohhh!
--- Matrons ---
Look at it! Look at it!
--- Mrs. Stotesbury ---
Hollis, darling, you may put me at the head of the
list of sponsors for your artists' colony-- if Mr.
Mizner will design it, of course.
--- Addison ---
Just as soon as my schedule permits.
--- Hollis ---
You--where have you been all my life?
--- Mr. and Mrs. Stotesbury ---
Look at it!
--- Four Aristocrats ---
Look at it!
--- All the Aristocrats ---
Look at it!
--- Hollis ---
You--you're the answer to my prayers.
--- Mrs. Stotesbury ---
Notice the details!
--- Aristocrats ---
Ahhh...
--- Hollis ---
You--you're one in a million.
--- Mr. Stotesbury ---
What's that? It's enormous!
--- Addison ---
Remember the breakfast nook?
--- Hollis ---
You--where have you been all my life?
--- Mrs. Stotesbury ---
Wait til Lily Wanamaker sees it.
--- Aristocrat #1, Mrs. Geist ---
James, I want a house.
--- Mr. Geist ---
We have a house.
--- Mrs. Geist ---
I mean I want a house like hers.
--- Mr. Geist ---
Like that?
--- Mrs. Geist ---
LIke that, only different.
--- Aristocrat #2, Mrs. Trumbauer ---
Edgar,

George, I want a house.
--- Mrs. Trumbauer ---
Write out a check.
--- Mrs. Dupont ---
I know we have a house,
I mean a winter house,
A house like Eva's
Only maybe with a swimming pool.
--- Aristocrat #4, Mr. Wanamaker ---
Lovey,
Let's build a house.
--- Mrs. Dupont ---
Write out a check.
--- Mrs. Wanamaker ---
Why build a house?
--- Mr. Wanamaker ---
Why not?
Jim is building,
Edgar's building,
Everybody--
--- Addison ---
You--
--- Mrs. Wanamaker ---
I'll write a check.
--- Mrs. Stotesbury ---
I hate hotels.
--- Addison ---
--where have you been all my life?
--- Mrs. Stotesbury ---
We'll never have to stay at this hotel again.
--- Mrs. Wanamaker ---
I hate hotels.
--- Addison ---
You--?
--- Mrs. Wanamaker ---
Hotels are boring.
--- Addison ---
You're the answer to my prayers.
--- Mrs. Trumbauer ---
I hate hotels.
--- All the Aristocrats ---
I want a house!
--- Mrs. Wanamaker ---
Lovey, what's the man's name?
--- Addison ---
You--
--- Mr. Wanamaker ---
Misner.
--- Addison ---
You're one in a million!
--- Mrs. Wanamaker ---
Mr. Misner--
--- Hollis ---
Mizner.
--- Addison ---
You--
--- Hollis ---
You--
--- Both ---
Where have you been all my life?
--- Hollis ---
You--
--- Addison ---
You--
--- Hollis ---
You have the vision--
--- Addison ---
They have the money--
--- Hollis ---
We--
--- Addison ---
We--
--- Both ---
Both have a dream.
--- Hollis ---
Me,
I'd say we're a team.
--- Addison ---
Me, too.
--- Both ---
Who knew that you'd come into my life?
Where have you been?
--- Aristocrats ---
Ooh! Look at it!
Ooh! Look at it! Look at it! Look at it!
Mr. Mizner...
Mr. M..
Addie...
Addie darling...
--- Mrs. Geist ---
You understand, we'll need
A cottage for the staff.
--- Addison ---
Of course.
--- Mr. Trumbauer ---
My wife insists we build
The house around a courtyrad.
--- Addison ---
Understood.
--- Aristocrats ---
We'll want a ballroom...
Include a bowling alley...
A conservatory...
A garage for the cars...
Could you add a guest house?...
Don't forget the wine cellar...
How about a breezeway?...
And there has to be a tennis court--
--- Hollis ---
Ladies and gentleman, I assure you that Mr. Mizner
will build each of you the precise house that you desire.
--- Addison and Hollis ---
You--
Where have you been all my life?
--- Mrs. Dupont ---
The ambiance--!
--- Mrs. Wanamaker ---
The travertine--!
--- Mrs. Trumbauer ---
The cupola--!
--- Addison, Hollis, and Aristocrats ---
You--
--- All the Matrons ---
Addie--!
--- Addison and Hollis ---
--you're the answer to my prayers...
--- Mrs. Stotesbury ---
I'm so proud that ours was the first of his houses--
--- All ---
You, you're one in a million--
--- Addison ---
And with your commission--
--- Hollis ---
And your ambition--
--- Both ---
And their tradition
Of acquisition,
We'll build
--- All ---
A place
For a brand new world to play.
Where have you been all my life?
Don't go away!
