Boca Raton,
Come down to Boca Raton,
Where every sky's the bluest you've seen,
Where all year long the grass remains green,
Where every beach is clean and pristine.
--- Unknown ---
Buy a lot
Or even two.
Have we got
A lot for you!

Boca Raton,
Come down to Boca Raton,
Where every vista sparkles and gleams,
Soon a city to feed your dreams!
--- Yacht Club Boys ---
The city beautiful,
A work of art in itself,
The city beautiful,
Could be displayed on a shelf.
A picture-perfect place,
A place of grace and space,
A world of seaside sports
And leafy malls,
A world of jai alai courts
And concert halls,
A world of boating, hot springs,
Golf links, tennis--
Newport, Saratoga, Venice...

My friends, when our forefathers first set
foot on these shores, they were given a great
gift. A New World, pristine and unspoiled, where
anything was possible.
--- Unknown ---
A land of limitless frontiers. A home for enterprising pioneers.
--- Unknown ---
And we're still heading west,
Crossing mountains and plains,
Planting roots, building town as we go.
--- Women ---
Pressing on as we're pressed,
Through the winds and the rains,
--- All ---
Taking risks, tempting fate,
Till we open every gate--
That's what makes this country great!
--- Wilson ---
America, my friends! A land of opportunities!
And here it is! The land itself--
--- Unknown ---
Land--yes! Land to build a future on!
Dirt--yes! Dirt, as in pay dirt!
Filth--yes! Filth, as in filthy lucre!
--- Chorus ---
Yes!
--- Wilson ---
Up in the Klondike we shoveled it aside to
get at the wealth which it contained. Down
here, it is the wealth!
--- Unknown ---
Buy it now,
Sell it later
And get rich guick!
Pick a spot,
Buy a plot,
When the spot gets hot,
Sell the lot.
My friends, you know what
You just got?
You got really rich--!

Really quick!

Bound to make a bundle! Sure thing!

Bound to make a bundle--!

Bound to make a bundle,
Just a matter of time...

Where once again he's killing your dreams
Because he keeps on cooking up schemes
Until they fall apart at the seams.
