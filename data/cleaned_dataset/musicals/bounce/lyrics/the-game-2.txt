------ The Game 2 ------
--- Addison ---
To hell with him.
--- Nellie ---
The hell with him.
--- Wilson ---
The hell with them.
--- All Three ---
What's next?
--- Wilson ---
It all comes down to staying in the game.
--- Addison ---
The thing that really matters is the game.
--- Nellie ---
You win, you lose,
There's no one but yourself
That you can blame.
--- All Three ---
The only thing that matters is the game.
--- Nellie ---
Just a bad bet.
--- Wilson ---
Just a slight dent.
--- Addison ---
Slam the door shut
On what
You spent.
--- All Three ---
Every exit is an entrance into something
else!
--- Unknown ---
The only thing you hvae to bear in mind
Is close the book
And never look
Behind.
--- Wilson and Addison ---
Straight ahead, Papa said.
--- Nellie ---
Take a chance or else you're dead.
--- All Three ---
You find a new frontier and stake a claim.
The thing that really matters is the game.
--- Wilson ---
Cut a new deck.
--- Nellie ---
Make a new move.
--- Addison ---
When you've got nothing left to prove--
--- All Three ---
Doesn't take long to see that you've
Got to go somewhere else!
--- Willson and Nellie ---
You were the best thing that ever has happened
to me--
Still are.
The best and worst thing that ever has happened
to me,
So far.
--- Unknown ---
We missed the boat, my friend.
It sailed, forget it.
We let it
Pass right in front of our eyes.
What a suprise.
--- Unknown ---
Sometimes I wish that you never has happened
to me--
Sometimes.
You were the best thing that ever had happened
to me--
Sometimes.
--- Unknown ---
But if I'm lucky, pal,
You shortly will be
The second-best thing that has happened to me.
--- Nellie ---
The hell with him.
--- Wilson ---
The hell with her.
--- Addison ---
The hell with it.
--- All Three ---
What's next?
--- Real Estate Promoter ---
Land boom!
With a double whammy, boy!
Land boom!
Profits this thick!
Land boom!
Down around Miami, boy--
The weather's kind of clammy,
But it's get rich quick!
--- Unknown ---
Brand new communities,
Just take your pick.
Lots of opportunities--
All you need is capital,
A little does the trick.
Beg or steal or borrow,
It'll double by tomorrow.
Only get your ass to Florida
And get rich quick!
--- Addison ---
The thing that really matters is the game.
--- Nellie ---
The trick is getting back into the game.
--- Wilson ---
You lose the pot, it's over with.
Don't stick with it, it's gone.
--- Nellie ---
Just stop.
--- Wilson ---
Close shop.
--- Addison ---
Move on.
--- All Three ---
To lose the hand you're sure of is a shame,
But life without the strife is pretty tame.
When you've lost all you've got,
Go and find another pot:
Switch tables,
Raise the stakes,
Adjust your aim.
The only thing that matters is the game.
--- Nellie ---
Where's the next bar?
--- Wilson ---
Where's the next ounce?
--- Addison ---
Where's the next chance for me to bounce?
--- All Three ---
Winning may be what really counts,
But all the same--
--- Wilson ---
The only thing that matters is the game...
--- Nellie ---
The only thing that matters is the game...
--- Addison ---
The only thing that matters is the game...
