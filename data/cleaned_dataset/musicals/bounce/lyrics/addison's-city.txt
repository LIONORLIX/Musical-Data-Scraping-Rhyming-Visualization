------ Addison's City ------
--- Hollis ---
That's what I wanted, a city for artists,
Versailles by the Florida sea.
A kind of haven for hundreds of artists,
And their great patron saint would be me!
And then I meet Willie--
And he says to me,
Look what Addie's done,
And he's just begun!
Why be saint to hundreds?
Be saint to one!
Think what he can do--!
Think what we can do.
--- Unknown ---
You'll design a city, Addie,
Like no city ever seen before.
Think of it: a city, Addie,
Every single window, every door--
You could build a Paris, Addie,
But Paris made anew,
A Paris for today.
--- Wilson ---
Paris, U.S.A.--
--- Hollis ---
A Paris made by you--
Addison's city.
--- Wilson ---
Venice and jazz combined--
--- Hollis ---
Addison's city.
--- Wilson ---
Every last stick and stone designed
By the same screwy, brilliant mind--
--- Both ---
Addison's city.
--- Hollis ---
Newport with fizz--
--- Wilson ---
Rio with shade--
--- Hollis ---
Capri as it is,
But not so staid.
--- Wilson ---
Not so much a city--a parade!
--- Both ---
Addison's city!
--- Wilson ---
The time is now,
The place isnow,
Your chance to do what you
Were born to do
Is now.
A chance like this will never come again,
Believe me,
Embrace it now.
--- Hollis ---
Come on, what do you think?
--- Addison ---
I think my brother would say anythin to get what
he wants.
--- Hollis ---
Addie, he's not--
--- Addison ---
All right, don't push me.
--- Wilson ---
The moment's now.
The door is wide.
An opportunity
That mustn't be
Denied.
Don't muff it now.
--- Nellie ---
What's there to muff? He's got everything he wants as it is.
--- Wilson ---
Then it's time to want something else.
--- Unknown ---
He should build a city, Countess.
Not just fancy forts for rich old farts.
--- Hollis ---
Much more than a city, Countess,
More like an amalgam of the arts.
Something international but bold--
--- Wilson ---
Everything too much.
--- Hollis ---
European verve--
--- Wilson ---
New York City nerve--
--- Hollis ---
Only with the Mizner touch--
--- Both ---
Addison's city!
--- Hollis ---
It really is a marvelous idea!
--- Nellie ---
Yeah? Consider the source.
--- Wilson ---
You too, Countess.
--- Unknown ---
Your chance is now.
You hear that sound?
I mean your chance to bounce,
Not merely bounce around.
You think it's all just men
And money and martinis.
You know what you need?
--- Nellie ---
What?
--- Wilson ---
Boca Raton--
--- Unknown ---
Six hundred acres of prime, undeveloped real estate
wrapped around an inlet up the coast. An adventure, boys
and girls. And it's a perfect fit--
--- Unknown ---
You make it up--
You make it real.
You make us a sweetheart of a deal.
Everybody gets to spin the wheel!
--- Nellie ---
Yeah? What do you get?
--- Wilson ---
A chance for now,
To make amends.
--- Addison ---
Oh, God.
--- Wilson ---
A chance to ditch the blues
And pay my dues
To friends.
And if I chance to make a buck or two
Along the way, and so do you,
Why not?
--- Hollis ---
Why not?
--- Nellie ---
Why not?
--- Addison ---
Why not?!
--- Wilson ---
Oh, come on, Addie--
The four of us together, what fun!
--- Hollis ---
Say yes!
--- Wilson ---
You and me against the world, brother,
You and me against the world!
You and me together,
But in very different weather--
Now it's pretty.
--- Wilson and Hollis ---
Don't you want to build a city?
--- Unknown ---
Your chance is now.
Don't settle in.
--- Hollis, Wilson and Nellie ---
You're wasting time
When what you are
Is what you've been.
This city's something new,
A door into
The future--
The future's now.
--- Wilson ---
Gotta make tracks!
--- Nellie ---
Gotta make hay!
--- Hollis ---
Gotta take a risk and seize the day!
--- All Three ---
Gotta travel on--
--- Addison ---
All right, okay!
--- Wilson, Hollis and Nellie ---
The time is now,
The place is here,
This is our chance to open up a new frontier,
--- All ---
And if there was a time to pioneer,
The time is now!
