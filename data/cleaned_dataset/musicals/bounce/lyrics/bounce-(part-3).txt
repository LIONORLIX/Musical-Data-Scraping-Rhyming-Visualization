------ Bounce (Part 3) ------
--- Voices ---
Look at it!
Look at it! Look at it!
--- Wilson ---
Addie, look at it--!
You see what's ahead?
--- Addison ---
I thought we were done.
--- Wilson ---
Get ready to bounce.
--- Addison ---
You'd think, once you're dead--
--- Wilson ---
Come on, we'll have fun!
What's happened to your bounce?
--- Addison ---
A road without end--
I can wait.
--- Wilson ---
'Round the bend,
There's something great
To take by the throat--
That's a quote--
--- Both ---
When you see it, pounce.
--- Addison ---
Right, you're right,
And Papa was right, you're right--
--- Both ---
We're still on our way--
That's what we do best--
Improving our bounce.
As Papa would say,
We're still heading west,
And that's the thing that counts.
--- Wilson ---
We're still pioneers,
Like before--
--- Both ---
A lot of frontiers
To explore.
Ready, set, go,
Bro--!
--- Wilson ---
You know what that is, don't you? It's the
road to opportunity.
--- Addison ---
It's the road to eternity.
--- Wilson ---
The greatest opportunity of all! Sooner or
later we're bound to get it right.
