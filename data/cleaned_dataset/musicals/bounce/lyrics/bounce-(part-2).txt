------ Bounce (Part 2) ------
--- Addison ---
Up then down, what else is new?
That was Papa's song.
Mama, what he said was true--
I just heard it wrong.
Willie's been the wise on all along.
--- Unknown ---
I'm fine, it's okay,
The past is the past,
I know how to bounce.
As Papa would say,
You have to learn fast--
Well, Mama, watch me bounce.
--- Unknown ---
The ones you love die
Or move on.
No goodbye.
Just bang! They're gone.
Whatever's been said,
Dead is dead.
Isn't that what counts?
--- Unknown ---
From years on the side
As second in line,
I bounce pretty well.
All right, I can't glide.
But, Mama, I'm fine,
And you can go to Hell!
--- Unknown ---
Whenever there's change
In the text,
You're bound to feel strange
And perplexed.
On to what's new,
On to what's next--
--- Unknown ---
Bounce...
Bounce...
Bounce...
Bounce!
