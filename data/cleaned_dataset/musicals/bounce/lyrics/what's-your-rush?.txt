------ What's Your Rush? ------
--- Dance Hall Girl ---
What's your rush?
Too bad you're in such a rush--
Honey,
Stick around,
Relax and get warm.
--- Unknown ---
What's out there?
A lot of lousy weather.
What's in here?
A chance for you and me to be together...
--- Unknown ---
Celebrate.
Believe me, kid, the gold will wait.
I won't.
Getting late,
And listen to that storm...
--- Unknown ---
What's out there?
Snow and slush.
If you're so determined, though,
Mush, boy, mush.
Otherwise--
--- Unknown ---
Ooh, those eyes--
I mean, what's your rush?
--- Unknown ---
My name's Nellie.
--- Wilson ---
Willie.
--- Nellie ---
I like that. You new to these parts, Willie?
--- Wilson ---
Uh-huh. And you?
--- Nellie ---
I've been here long enough to learn a thing or two.
--- Wilson ---
Like what?
--- Nellie ---
Like when something good comes by, you grab it.
Because up here, good things have a habit of not coming
by...
--- Unknown ---
When you're through,
There's lots of things I'd like to do--
Bad things.
Maybe you
Could help me to reform.
--- Unknown ---
I could get
Such a crush...
What's the matter, baby?
Is that a blush?
Trust me, hon...
Just for fun...
Come on, what's your rush?
