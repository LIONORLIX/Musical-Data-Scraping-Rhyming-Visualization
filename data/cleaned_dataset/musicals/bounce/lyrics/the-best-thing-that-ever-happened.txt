------ The Best Thing That Ever Happened ------
--- Nellie ---
Life is pretty smooth.
--- Wilson ---
Indeed.
--- Nellie ---
If a little dull.
--- WIlson ---
I bet.
--- Nellie ---
Still, it isn't bad.
--- Wilson ---
Or it isn't bad enough.
--- Nellie ---
Oh, badder than you think.
Though nothing like Alaska.
--- Wilson ---
Would you care to dance?
--- Nellie ---
Right now?
--- WIlson ---
I don't see why not.
--- Nellie ---
In here?
Everyone will stare.
--- Wilson ---
I can only hope they do.
--- Nellie ---
Well, let me have a drink.
Right.
Dance me to Alaska.
--- Wilson ---
Funny, running into you this way.
--- Nellie ---
Why's that?
--- Wilson ---
Well, I came to the track today because I felt lucky. I was right.
--- Nellie ---
Oh?
--- Wilson ---
You're still the best thing that ever has happened to me.
--- Nellie ---
Bullshit.
--- Wilson ---
Okay, the best thing that could ever happen to me.
--- Nellie ---
Bullshit.
--- Wilson ---
How could I realize
What rich was really?
Ideally,
Somewhere I should have been told,
Kid, you've struck gold.
--- Nellie ---
--you've struck gold.
You were the best thing that ever had
happened to me--
Back then.
Of course not much very good ever happened
to me back then.
--- Wilson ---
Things change as time goes by.
You never know when
The best that happened can happen again.
--- Unknown ---
Which brings me to an interesting point--
--- Nellie ---
What's that?
--- Wilson ---
Well, the way I understand it, you used my money to make
your money. In fact, from where I'm sitting, your money
is my money.
--- Nellie ---
You know, for a gatecrasher with a soup stain on his
necktie, you've got a lot of nerve.
--- Wilson ---
How 'bout this? We split it fifty-fifty?
--- Nellie ---
How 'bout this? I call the bouncer and get you
thrown out on your ass.
--- Wilson ---
Okay, forget the money. I've got a better way for you
to pay me back--
--- Nellie ---
Why do I feel a proposition coming on?
--- Wilson ---
Try to think of it as a proposal.
--- Unknown ---
I'd like to still be the best thing
That's happened to you.
--- Nellie ---
Really?
--- Wilson ---
Another moment like this
May not happen to you.
--- Nellie ---
Really?
--- Wilson ---
To think I'd meet someone
Who could surprise me
And size me
Up without cutting me down--
--- Both ---
Ain't this a town?
--- Unknown ---
With all the best and the worst
That have happened to us,
Why not?
We just might be the best thing
That has happened to us.
Why not?
--- Unknown ---
When all is said and done--
You happen to be
The best thing ever that's happened to me.
--- Nellie ---
You're good.
--- WIlson ---
You're great.
--- Both ---
Let's see.
--- Hollis ---
Eleanor, your horse came in!
--- Nellie ---
You're telling me...
--- Both ---
All the way from Alaska...
