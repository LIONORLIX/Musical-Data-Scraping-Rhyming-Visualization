------ Gold! ------
--- Wilson ---
Addie, look what it says in this newspaper...
--- Prospector ---
Yee-haw!
--- Wilson ---
Gold!
--- Addison ---
Gold?
--- Prospector ---
Bet your little titty, boys!
--- Wilson ---
Gold!
--- Mama ---
Gold!
--- Prospector ---
Nuggets this thick!
--- Wilson ---
Gold!
--- Prospector ---
Gold! Go to Dawson City, boys!
It isn't very pretty,
But it's get rich quick!
--- Wilson ---
They found gold in the Yukon!
--- Addison ---
The Yukon? Where's the Yukon?
--- Mama ---
Who cares?!
--- Wilson ---
It's in Alaska--
--- Prospector ---
Found me a mother lode,
Warn't no trick!
Wanna find another lode?
Dig in any mountain,
Pan in any crick!
Grab yourself a bucket
And a shovel and a pick
And with a little bit of luck it
Means you get rich quick!
--- Wilson ---
Let's go--
--- Addison ---
Where? To Alaska?
--- Mama ---
Haven't you been listening?
Gold!
Sitting there and glistening!
Gold just
Lying around!
--- Wilson ---
Gold dust
Glittering and littering the goddamn ground!
--- Addison ---
In Alaska? Way up in Alaska?
--- Mama ---
Oh, go on, Addie,
The two of you together--!
What fun!
--- Addison ---
But what about you, Mama? You need us here at home.
--- Mama ---
Home's gone. The bank just took it.
--- Wilson ---
You and me against the world, Addie,
You an me against the world!
You and me together,
Weathering the weather,
Fording the crevasses--
--- Addison ---
Freezing off our asses--
--- Wilson ---
We'll never make our fortune
Just by sitting on the porch 'n'
Looking wistful,
When there are nuggets by the fistful...
--- Mama ---
Nuggets by the fistful--!
Time to leave the nest.
--- Wilson and Mama ---
Time to venture forth--
Can't go further west,
Might as well go north,
Where there's all that--
--- Addison ---
Cold.
--- Wilson and Mama ---
Gold!
--- Mama ---
Remember what your Papa did:
Be bold!
--- Wilson ---
Exactly!
--- Addison ---
I don't know...
--- Mama ---
Grab the opportunity!
--- Addison ---
How would we even get there?
--- Mama ---
That's what Papa said.
--- Addison ---
The whole thing might be over by the time--
--- Mama ---
Grab the opportunity
And take the road ahead!
--- Addison ---
I don't think he meant any oppor--
--- Mama ---
Never be content with what you are
But think of what you can become!
--- Wilson ---
Listen to Mama. She knows best.
Not to grab the chance,
Wouldn't that be dumb?
--- Mama ---
Papa said to grab,
And the world's your plum!
--- Addison ---
Did he? Well I suppose so, in a way...
--- Denizens ---
Gold!
--- Wilson ---
Okay, if you won't go--
--- Denizens ---
Gold!
--- Wilson ---
Then how about you?
--- Denizens ---
Gold! Gold!
--- Mama ---
If only I could!
--- Addison ---
Hey!
--- Wilson ---
Joke! I can't go without you. We're a team!
--- Denizens ---
Gold!
--- Addison ---
A team. We would be, wouldn't we?
--- Wilson ---
You bet we would!
--- Denizens ---
Gold! Gold!
--- Addison ---
And you really think we'll strike it rich?
--- Wilson ---
It won't be easy, but, brother, I see us coming through
that door--
--- Denizens ---
Gold!
--- Wilson ---
--our knapsacks filled with nuggets--
--- Denizens ---
Gold!
--- Wilson ---
--our purses stuffed with dust, our pockets bulging--
--- Mama ---
Stop, I'm going to faint!
--- Addison ---
Okay, we'll do it. Me and you.
--- Wilson ---
A century's beginning--
Gold will make it tick!
A century of enterprise
For you and me to lick!
That's what Papa meant. You're
Gonna miss the big adventure--
It's the dawning of the century
Of get rich quick!
--- Addison ---
A century's beginning,
Gold will make it tick!
--- Wilson ---
You and me against
The world, Addie!
--- Addison ---
A century of enterprise
For you and me
To lick!
--- Addison ---
That's what Papa
Meant, you're
Right, we're off on an
Adventure.
Just a shovel and a
Tent, you're
Right, we're ending our
Indenture
As we're
Entering the
Century
Of
--- Wilson ---
You and me
Against
The world!
--- Unknown ---
You and me
Together,
Weathering
The weather
As we're
Entering the
Century
Of
--- Mama ---
Time to
Leave the nest,
Time to
Venture forth,
Can't go
Further west,
Might as well go
North!
--- All ---
Get rich quick!
--- Mama ---
