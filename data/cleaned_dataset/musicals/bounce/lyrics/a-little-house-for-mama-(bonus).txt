------ A Little House for Mama (Bonus) ------
--- Addison ---
A pink and yellow skylight
To let the sun come streaming in,
A Chinese courtyard filled with trees
and flowers.
A little house for Mama.
--- Unknown ---
A terra cotta kitchen,
A paneled den for dreaming in,
An open porch to while away the hours.
A little house for Mama.
--- Unknown ---
No,
A nice big house for Mama.
--- Unknown ---
"M" is for the mullioned windows,
O is for the oriels,
T is for the terrace made of tile,
H is for the--uh--
H is for the hearthstone.
Put them all together they spell moth.
--- Unknown ---
A fireplace in every room
To keep her warm and cheerful
If she gets a chill,
A bedroom facing south
So she can look at the ocean
When she awakens.
A place to rest for Mama.
--- Unknown ---
A cozy nook, to read a book,
With wallpaper from France.
Mama likes to dance.
So, a mirrored ballroom not too large,
A sitting room I'll make my most exquisite
Yet.
--- Unknown ---
A shady trellis breezeway
When summer heat comes steaming in,
To keep her cool to shield her from
the showers.
A little gift from Addie
To Mama.
