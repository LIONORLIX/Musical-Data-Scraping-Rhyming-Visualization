------ Seconds and Years ------
--- DR. MADDEN ---
A little loss of memory is normal
And helpful in forgetting all her fears
--- DAN ---
I couldn't give a flying fuck what's normal
We haven't had a normal day in years
--- DR. MADDEN ---
Diana, are things becoming clearer with the treatment
--- DIANA ---
Well yes
--- DR. MADDEN ---
Is life less cloudy than it was before
--- DIANA ---
Yes
--- DR. MADDEN ---
Do you still feel your head is filled with concrete
--- DIANA ---
No, and you're not a scary rock star anymore
--- DR. MADDEN ---
Okay. Great.
--- DAN ---
What about her memory?
