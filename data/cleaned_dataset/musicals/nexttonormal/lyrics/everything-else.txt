------ Everything Else ------
--- Natalie ---
Mozart was crazy.
Flat fucking crazy.
Bat* shit, I hear.
--- Unknown ---
But his music's not crazy,
It's balanced, it's nimble,
It's crystalline clear.
--- Unknown ---
There's harmony, logic,
You listen to these.
You don't hear his doubts,
Or his debts or disease.
--- Unknown ---
You scan through the score,
And put fingers on keys,
And you play.
And everything else goes away.
Everything else goes away.
--- Unknown ---
And you play 'til it's perfect,
You play 'til you ache,
You play 'til the strings or your fingernails break.
--- Unknown ---
So you'll rock that recital,
And get into Yale.
So you won't feel so sick,
And you won't look so pale.
--- Unknown ---
'Cause you've got your full ride,
And you're early admit.
So you're done with this school,
And with all of this shit.
--- Unknown ---
And you graduate early,
You're gone as of May,
And there's nothing your paranoid parents can say.
--- Unknown ---
And you know that it's just a sonata away,
And you play,
And you play.
And everything else goes away,
Everything else goes away.
Everything else goes away.
