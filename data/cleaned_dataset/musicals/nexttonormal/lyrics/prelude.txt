------ Prelude ------
--- DAN ---
Let there be light
Now at last let there be light
We've been living in the dark for far to long
An endless night.
--- DAN and NATALIE ---
Let there be light
Sun and moon a million beams
Let it shake me shake me from these dreams
And wake me to what's real
Let us begin to heal
Let there be light
