DR. MADDEN
Diana it's been 2 weeks and we've yet to break through to the roots of your depression.
I'd like to try something new today.
Sometimes when these stories are hard to tell hypnosis can be helpful.
--- DIANA ---
I don't think I could be hypnotized, I mean it's fine, I'm just not the type.
--- DR. MADDEN ---
Put your feet on the floor.  And your hands in your lap.  Now breathe.
--- Unknown ---
(sung)
Walk with me
Walk with me

DIANA (spoken)

Go all the way the down
Down a long flight of stairs
--- Unknown ---
DIANA (spoken)
Stairs?
--- DR.MADDEN ---
Go step by step into the darkness down there
--- Unknown ---
DIANA (spoken)
Should we turn on a light?  You know, with the stairs.
--- DR. MADDEN ---
Walk with me, down a hall
A hall with blue light
At the end of there's a door
It's a door that you've never laid eyes on before
Open the door
Open the door

For what sorrows may last
Then make up your mind to be well

DAN
Di, you come home form these sessions in tears.  Is this helping?  Di? Di?
--- DIANA ---
We were both undergrads, architecture.
The baby wasn't planned, neither was the marriage.
I had always expected to be too busy but when the baby
came it all seemed to make sense until...until...
--- DR. MADDEN ---
Until?
--- Unknown ---
(sung)
DAN
He's not here, he's not here
Love I know you know
--- DR. MADDEN ---
Make up your mind to live stronger now
Make up your mind let the truth be revealed
Admit what you've lost and live with the cost
At times it does hurt to be healed

DR. MADDEN (spoken)
Unresolved loss can lead to depression and a fear of loss to anxiety.
The more you hold to something you've lost the more you fear losing it.
Depression, anxiety, depression, anxiety, one leads to the next, then the other, it's a vicious cycle.
--- Unknown ---
Wouldn't you like to be free from all that finally?
Wouldn't you like to go home clear out his room, maybe
spend some time with your daughter, and let your son go at last?
--- Unknown ---
HENRY (spoken)
Should we go?
--- Unknown ---
DIANA and NATALIE (spoken)
Yes.
