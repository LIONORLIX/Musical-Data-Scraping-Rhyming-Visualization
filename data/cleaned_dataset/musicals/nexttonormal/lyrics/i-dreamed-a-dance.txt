------ I Dreamed A Dance ------
--- DIANA ---
I saw you light the ballroom
With your sparkling eyes so blue
Graceful as an angel's wing
I dreamed a dance with you
--- Unknown ---
You whispered slyly, softly
You told me you would be true
We spun around a thousand stars
I dreamed a dance with you
--- Unknown ---
I know the night is dying dear
I know the day will dawn
--- Unknown ---
Both
The dancers may disappear
Still the dance goes on
--- Unknown ---
Gabe
And on
--- DIANA ---
I'll wake alone tomorrow
The dream of our dance is through
But now until forever love
I'll live to dance with you
I'll dream my love
I'll live my love
