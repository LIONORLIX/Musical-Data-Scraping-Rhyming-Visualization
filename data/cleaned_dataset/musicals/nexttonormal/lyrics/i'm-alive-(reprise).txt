------ I'm Alive (reprise) ------
--- Unknown ---
I am more than memory
I am what might be I am mystery
Come closer
Come closer
--- Unknown ---
I am old as time
I'm forever young
I am every song that will stay unsung I'll find you
Remind you
--- Unknown ---
Until you name me
you can't tame me
This is one old game
I can play so well
--- Unknown ---
I'm alive I'm alive
I am so alive
And the medicines failed
And the doctors lied
--- Unknown ---
I'm alive I'm alive
I am death defied
--- Unknown ---
I'm alive
So alive
--- Unknown ---
I'm alive
--- Unknown ---
I'm alive
--- Unknown ---
I'm alive
