------ Maybe ------
--- DIANA ---
Maybe I’ve lost it at last
Maybe my last lucid moment has past
I’m dancing with death, I suppose.
But really, who knows?
Could be I’m crazy to go.
They say you should stay with the devil you know
But when life needs a change
And the one devil won’t
You fight to the devil you don’t
--- Unknown ---
Maybe I’m tired of the game
Of coming up short of the rules, of the shame
And maybe you feel that way too.
I see me in you
A girl full of anger and hope
A girl with a mother who just couldn’t cope
A girl who felt caught
And thought no one could see
That maybe one day she’ll be free.
--- NATALIE ---
It’s so lovely that you’re sharing
No, really, I’m all ears
But where has all this caring been
For sixteen years
For all those years I’d pray that
You’d go away for good
Half the time afraid that you really would
When I thought you might be dying
I cried for all we’ve never be
But there’ll be no more crying
Not for me
--- DIANA ---
Things will get better you’ll see
--- NATALIE ---
Not for me
--- DIANA ---
You’ll see.
--- NATALIE ---
Not for me
--- DIANA ---
You’ll see
--- NATALIE ---
Not for me
--- DIANA ---
You’ll see
--- NATALIE ---
Not for me
--- DIANA ---
You’ll see
--- Unknown ---
Maybe we can’t be okay
But maybe we’re tough and we’ll try anyway
We’ll live with what’s real
Let go of what’s past
And maybe I’ll see you at last
--- Unknown ---
We tried to give you a normal life. I realize now, I have no clue what that is.
--- NATALIE ---
I don’t need a life that’s normal
That’s way too far away
But something next to normal
Would be okay
Yeah, something next to normal
That’s the thing I’d like to try
Close enough to normal
To get by
--- DIANA ---
We’ll get by
