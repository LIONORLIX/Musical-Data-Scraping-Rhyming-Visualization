------ I Am the One (reprise) ------
--- DAN ---
I am the one who loved you.
I am the one who stayed.
I am the one and you walked away.
I am the one who waited
And now you act like you just don't give a damn.
Like you never knew who I am.
--- GABE ---
I am the one who knows you.
--- DAN ---
I am.
--- GABE ---
I am the one you fear.
--- DAN ---
I am.
--- GABE ---
I am the one...
--- GABE ---
...who's always been here.
--- DAN ---
I?ve always been here
--- GABE ---
I am the one who'll heal you.
--- DAN ---
I am
--- GABE ---
I know you told her that I'm not worth a damn,
But I know you know who I am.
--- DAN ---
No.
--- GABE ---
I know you know who I am.
--- DAN ---
Can't you just leave me alone?
--- GABE ---
I know you know who I am.
--- DAN ---
Why didn't you go with her?
--- GABE ---
'Cause I'm holding on
--- DAN ---
Let me go...
--- GABE ---
And I won't let go
--- DAN ---
Let me go!
--- GABE ---
And I want you to know
--- DAN ---
Yeah, you don?t know
--- BOTH ---
I am the one who held you
I am the one who cried
I am the one who watched while you died.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I am the one who loved you
I tried pretending that I don't give a damn,
--- GABE ---
But you've always known who I am.
--- DAN ---
