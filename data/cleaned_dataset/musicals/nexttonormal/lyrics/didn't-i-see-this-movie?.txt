Didn't I see this movie, with McMurphy and the nurse?
That hospital was heavy, but this cuckoo's nest is worse.
Isn't this the one where in the end the good guys fry?
Didn't I see this movie, and didn't I cry?
Didn't I cry?

Like, compared to what?

What makes you think I'd lose my mind for you?

I ain't no Francis Farmer, I don't fight for you

NATALIE (spoken)
Go away!

So stay out of my brain
I'm no princess of pain
Didn't I see this movie, where the doctor looks like you?
Where the patient for impatient and said, Sorry, doc, I'm through?
I know where this is going, and I know what you're about.
Cause I have seen this movie and I walked out
I walked out
I'm walking...
