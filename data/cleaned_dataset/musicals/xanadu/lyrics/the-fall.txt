------ The Fall ------
--- Unknown ---
I see the early glow
I hear you say hello
I watch the shadows fall
I don't see you at all
--- Unknown ---
It's a lie
It's a lie
--- Unknown ---
I see the autumn rain
Falling on my window pane
I hear you say goodbye
I see a tear in your eye
--- Unknown ---
It's a lie
It's a lie
Our love couldn't go wrong
How could I know I was only dreaming
And now, now that you're gone
I will go on really believing
I take the fall
--- Unknown ---
I see you slip away,
Into another day
There's no-one else around
I watch the sun go down
--- Unknown ---
It's a lie
It's a lie
Our love couldn't go wrong
How could I know I was only dreaming
And now, now that you're gone
I will go on really believing
I take the fall
--- Instrumental ---
--- Unknown ---
I take the fall
--- Unknown ---
I see you in a dream
You turn and start to go
I call to you once more
Guess that I'm takin' the fall
--- Unknown ---
It's a lie
It's a lie
Our love couldn't go wrong
How could I know I was only dreaming
And now, now that you're gone
I will go on really believing
I take the fall
--- Unknown ---
Our love couldn't go wrong
How could I know I was only dreaming
And now, now that you're gone
I will go on really believing
