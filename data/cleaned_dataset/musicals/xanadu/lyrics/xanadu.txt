------ Xanadu ------
--- OLIVIA NEWTON-JOHN ---
A place where nobody dared to go
The love that we came to know
They call it Xanadu
--- Unknown ---
And now
Open your eyes and see
What we have made is real
We are in Xanadu
--- Unknown ---
A million lights are dancing
And there you are
A shooting star
An everlasting world
And you're here with me
Eternally
--- Unknown ---
Xanadu, Xanadu,
In Xanadu
Xanadu, Xanadu,
In Xanadu
--- Unknown ---
Xanadu, your neon lights will shine
For you, Xanadu
--- Unknown ---
The love
The echoes of long ago
You needed the world to know
They are in Xanadu
--- Unknown ---
The dream
That came through a million years
That lived on through all the tears
It came to Xanadu
--- Unknown ---
A million lights are dancing
And there you are
A shooting star
An everlasting world
And you're here with me
Eternally
--- Unknown ---
Xanadu, Xanadu,
In Xanadu
Xanadu, Xanadu,
In Xanadu
--- Unknown ---
Now that I'm here
Now that you're near in Xanadu
Now that I'm here
Now that you're near in Xanadu
