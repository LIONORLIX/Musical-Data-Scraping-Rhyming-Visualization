------ Don't Walk Away ------
--- Sonny ---
Why do I say
Don't walk away
You'll be the way you were before
When you don't want me anymore
--- Unknown ---
Don't turn around
Don't ever leave
A lonely room where empty days
Are gathering to meet me when you're

Is it a dream,
When will it end
When everything we've ever known
Has ended and I'm all alone
--- Unknown ---
Where will I go

Where will I be
The feelings that I've never shown
Maybe I'll find the answer when you're
