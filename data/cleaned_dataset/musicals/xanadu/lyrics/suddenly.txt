Kira:  If only there were a book.  A magic book!
That listed all the locations in Los Angeles and had their phone numbers next to it.
--- Unknown ---
Sonny:  Yeah!
--- Unknown ---
Kira:  And if that book had pages the color of amber!
--- Unknown ---
Sonny:  I know!  I?ll look it up in the phone book!
--- Unknown ---
Kira:  My god!  You?re brilliant!
--- Unknown ---
Sonny:  It?s ringing!
She walks in, I'm suddenly a hero
I'm taken in, my hopes begin to rise
--- Kira ---
Look at me, can't you tell I'd be so
Thrilled to see the message in your eyes
--- Sonny ---
You make it seem I'm so close to my dream
And then suddenly it's all there
--- Kira ---
Suddenly--
--- Both ---
The wheels are in motion
And I, I'm ready to sail any ocean
Suddenly I don't need the answers
'Cos I, I'm ready to take all my chances with you
--- Sonny ---
Oh, hi.  My name is Sonny Malone and
I?d like to rent this large auditorium for an event I?m planning.
Yeah, I can be there in five minutes.  Where are you?  Got it.
Ok, so take Melrose, uh-huh, past La Cienega.  Uh-huh, then past La Brea
. . .
--- Unknown ---
And how can I feel you're all that matters
I'd rely on anything you say
--- Kira ---
I'll take care that no illusions shatter
If you dare to say what you should say
--- Sonny ---
You make it seem I'm so close to my dream
And then suddenly it's all there
--- Kira ---
Suddenly--
--- Both ---
The wheels are in motion
And I, I'm ready to sail any ocean
Suddenly I don't need the answers
'Cos I, I'm ready to take all my chances with you
--- Unknown ---
Sonny:  Kira, let?s go talk to the landlord of this place.
He has an office in Downtown, L.A.
--- Unknown ---
Kira:  Downtown, L.A.?
--- Unknown ---
Sonny:  Don?t worry!
You make me feel so invincible I feel like I could go into Downtown, L.A. without a weapon!
--- Unknown ---
Why do I feel so alive when you're near,
There's no way any hurt can get
--- Both ---
Longing to spend
Every moment of the day with you--
With you
--- Kira ---
Suddenly--
--- Both ---
The wheels are in motion
And I, I'm ready to sail any ocean
Suddenly I don't need the answers
'Cos I, I'm ready to take all my chances with you
