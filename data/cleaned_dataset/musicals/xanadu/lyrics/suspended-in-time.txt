------ Suspended In Time ------
--- OLIVIA NEWTON-JOHN ---
A child and a fool in one
So sure I could need no one
My heart always on the run to nowhere
Now as you're holding me
My heart is reminding me
That now I could never be without you
--- Unknown ---
But how can our love succeed
A miracle is what we need
And so I appeal to you
To keep me suspended in time with you
Don't let this moment die
I get a feeling when I'm with you
None of the rules apply
But I know for certain
Goodbye is a crime
So love if you need me
Suspend me in time
--- Unknown ---
Wasted the time away
Holding our love at bay
Now I can't last a day without you
Your smile is a thrill to see
Eyes hold me tenderly
They'll shine in my memory forever
--- Unknown ---
But how can our love succeed
A miracle is what we need
And so I appeal to you
To keep me suspended in time with you
Don't let this moment die
I get a feeling when I'm with you
None of the rules apply
But I know for certain
Goodbye is a crime
So love if you need me
Suspend me in time
