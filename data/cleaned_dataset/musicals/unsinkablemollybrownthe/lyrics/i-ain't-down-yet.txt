------ I Ain't Down Yet ------
--- Unknown ---
I'm goan' to learn to read and write,
I'm goan' to see what there is to see,
So if you go from nowhere
On the road to somewhere
And you meet anyone
You know it's me.
--- Unknown ---
You'll see me carried shoulder high,
By famous people I've never met,
But till I leave the rear,
It's from the rear you'll hear,
I ain't down yet.
To show that you know,
You got to show you know you know!
--- Unknown ---
I'm goan' to move
From place to place
To find a house
With a goldn stair
And if that house is red
And has a big brass bed
I'm liiiivin' there.
--- Unknown ---
You'll see me carried shoulder high,
By famous people I've never met,
But till I leave the rear,
It's from the rear you'll hear,
