I want you to know, that I am happy for you
I wish nothing but the?best?for you both
--- Unknown ---
The?perfect version of me
Is he perverted?like me?
Would he go down on you in a theater?
So he speaks eloquently
And you can have his baby?
I'm sure you'd make a really excellent mother
--- Unknown ---
'Cause the love that you gave that we made
Wasn't able to make it enough for you
To be open wide, no
And every time you speak his name
Does he know why you told me
You'd be there until you died
'Til you died, but you're still alive
--- Unknown ---
And I'm here, to remind you
Of the mess you left when you went away
It's not fair, to deny me
Of the cross I bear that you gave to me
You, you, you oughta know
--- Unknown ---
You seem very well, things look peaceful
I'm not quite as well, I thought you should know
Did you forget about me, Mrs. Duplicity?
I hate to give him so much to live up to
It was a slap in the face
How quickly I was replaced
And are you thinking of me when he fucks you?
--- Unknown ---
'Cause the love that you gave that we made

And I'm here, to remind you
Of the mess you left when you went away

Of the cross I bear that you gave to me
You, you, you oughta know
--- JO & COMPANY ---
Ohh...
--- Unknown ---
'Cause the joke that you laid in the bed, that was me
And I'm not gonna fade as soon as you close your eyes
And you know it (and you know it)
And every time I scratch my nails
Down someone else's back, I hope you feel it
Well, can you feel it?
--- Unknown ---
And I'm here, to remind you
Of the mess you left when you went away
It's not fair (it's not fair), to deny me
Of the cross I bear that you gave to me
You (you), you (you), you (you) oughta know
And I'm here, to remind you
Of the mess you left when you went away
It's not fair, to deny me
Of the cross I bear that you gave to me
--- JO ---
You, you, you oughta know
