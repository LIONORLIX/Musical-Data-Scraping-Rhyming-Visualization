------ Entrâ€™Acte/Hands Clean ------
--- Chorus ---
Ooh, this could get messy
But you don't seem to mind
--- Unknown ---
Ooh, don't telling everybody
And overlook this?obvious?crime
--- Unknown ---
What part of?our history's reinvented and under rug?swept?
What part of your memory is selective and tends to forget?
--- Unknown ---
What with this distance it seems so obvious
