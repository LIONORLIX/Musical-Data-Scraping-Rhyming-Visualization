------ Mary Jane ------
--- STEVE ---
What's the matter, Mary Jane? You had a hard day
As you place the don't disturb?sign?on the door
You?lost your place in line again,?what a pity
You never seem to want to dance anymore
--- Unknown ---
Well it's full speed, baby
In the wrong direction
There's a few more bruises
If that's the way
You insist on heading
--- Unknown ---
Please be honest, Mary Jane
Are you happy
Please don't censor your tears
--- STEVE AND Chorus ---
You're the sweet crusader
And you're on your way
You're the last great innocent
--- STEVE ---
And that's why I love you
--- Unknown ---
So take this moment, Mary Jane, and be selfish
Worry not about the cars that go by
'Cause all that matters, Mary Jane, is your freedom
So keep warm my dear, keep dry
--- STEVE AND Chorus ---
What's the matter, Mary Jane?
Tell me
Tell me
What's the matter, Mary Jane?
Tell me
Tell me
Please be honest, Mary Jane
Tell me
