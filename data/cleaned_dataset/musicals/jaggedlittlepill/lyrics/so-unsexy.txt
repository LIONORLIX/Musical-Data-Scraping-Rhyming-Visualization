------ So Unsexy ------
--- STEVE ---
Oh, these little rejections, how they add up quickly
One offhanded word and I feel so?ungood?and
Somewhere along the?way, I think I gave you?the power to make
Me feel the way I thought only my mother could
--- Unknown ---
I can feel so unsexy for someone so beautiful
So unloved like I'm not on your mind
I can feel so boring
Feel so uninteresting
I can feel so lonely, but I say that I'm just fine
--- MARY JANE ---
Oh, these little protections, how they fail to serve me
One last minute phone call and I'm deflated
--- STEVE ---
How these little abandonments
Seem to sting so easily
Your hand pulling away and I'm devastated
--- MARY JANE, STEVE AND Chorus ---
I can feel so unsexy for someone so beautiful
So unloved like I'm not on your mind
I can feel so boring
Feel so uninteresting
So lonely, but I say that I'm just fine
--- MARY JANE ---
When will you stop leaving me, baby?
--- STEVE ---
When will you stop deserting me, baby?
--- MARY JANE AND Chorus ---
Am I just living with myself?
--- MARY JANE ---
Oh, these little rejections, how they disappear quickly
The moment I decide not to abandon me
