I'm broke, but I'm happy
I'm poor, but I'm kind
I'm short, but I'm healthy, yeah
--- Unknown ---
I'm high,?but?I'm grounded
I'm sane,?but I'm overwhelmed
I'm lost, but I'm?hopeful, baby
--- Unknown ---
And what it all comes down to
Is that everything's gonna be fine, fine, fine
'Cause I've got one hand in my pocket
And the other one is giving a high five
--- Unknown ---
I feel drunk, but I'm sober
I'm young and misunderstood
I'm tired, but I'm working, yeah
--- Unknown ---
I care, but I'm restless
I'm here, but I'm really gone
I'm right and I'm sorry, baby
--- Unknown ---
And what it all comes down to
Is that everything's gonna be quite alright
'Cause I've got one hand in my pocket
And the other one is flicking a cigarette
--- Unknown ---
And what it all comes down to
Is that I haven't got it all figured out just yet
But I've got one hand in my pocket
And the other one is giving a peace sign
--- Unknown ---
I'm free, but I'm focused
I'm green, but I'm wise
I'm hard, but I'm friendly, baby
--- Unknown ---
I'm sad, but I'm laughing
I'm brave, but I'm chicken shit
I'm sick, but I'm pretty, baby
--- JO & FRANKIE ---
And what it all boils down to
Is that no one's really got it figured out just yet
But I've got one hand in my pocket (one hand in my pocket)
And the other one is playing a piano
--- Unknown ---
And what it all comes down to my friends, yeah
Is that everything is just fine, fine, fine
'Cause I've got one hand in my pocket
And the other one is hailing--
Shit
