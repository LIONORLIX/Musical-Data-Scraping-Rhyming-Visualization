------ Your House ------
--- Unknown ---
I went to your house
Walked up the stairs
And I opened your door without ringing the bell
Walked down the hall
Into your room where I could smell you
And I shouldn't be here
Without permission
Shouldn't be here
Would you forgive me, love, if I danced in your shower?
Would you forgive me, love, if I laid in your bed?
Would you forgive me, love, if I stay all afternoon?
I took off my clothes
Put on your robe
And I went through your drawers
And I found your cologne
Went down to the den
Found your CDs
And I played your Joni
And I shouldn't stay long
You might be home soon
Shouldn't stay long
Would you forgive me, love, if I danced in your shower?
Would you forgive me, love, if I laid in your bed?
Would you forgive me, love, if I stay all afternoon?
I burned your incense
I ran a bath
I noticed a letter that sat on your desk
It said, Hello, love
I love you so, love
Meet me at midnight
And no, it wasn't my writing
I'd better go soon
It wasn't my writing
So forgive me, love, if I cry in your shower
So forgive me, love, for the salt in your bed
So forgive me, love, if I cry all afternoon
