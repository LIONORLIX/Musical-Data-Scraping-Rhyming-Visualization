------ Predator ------
--- Unknown ---
First I am spotted across the room
Sussed out for a degree of naiveite
When I make the cut then all systems go
And you take your first step toward me
--- Unknown ---
My eyes are invitations
My welcome sign is bright
My armor is porous enough to be worked by your design
My goodness is commendable but won’t pull your heart strings
This magnet for predators is dying to be discerning
--- Unknown ---
Your system of madness to mimic connection
Then you engender my trust as you pounce
You isolate and then divert attention
Distract from deception, keep me in the dark
--- Unknown ---
You kept me off balance with your charming deflection
You kept me distracted, couldn’t pick this apart
What started as union turned to isolation
And you are obsessed with your prey
--- Unknown ---
My eyes are invitations
My welcome sign is bright
My armor is porous enough to be worked by your design
My trust is commendable but won’t pull your heart strings
This magnet for predators is learning to be discerning
