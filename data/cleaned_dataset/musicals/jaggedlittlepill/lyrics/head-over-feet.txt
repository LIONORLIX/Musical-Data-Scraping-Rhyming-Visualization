------ Head Over Feet ------
--- STEVE ---
I had no choice
--- PHOENIX ---
But to hear you
--- STEVE ---
You stated your case
--- PHOENIX ---
Time and again
--- STEVE AND PHOENIX ---
I thought about it
--- MARY JANE ---
You?treat?me like
--- FRANKIE ---
I'm a?princess
--- MARY JANE ---
I'm not used to
--- FRANKIE ---
Liking that
You ask?how my day was
--- Unknown ---
You've already won me over in spite of me
--- FRANKIE AND MARY JANE ---
And don't be alarmed if I fall
--- FRANKIE ---
Head over feet
--- FRANKIE AND STEVE ---
And don't be surprised if I love you
--- FRANKIE ---
For all that you are
--- FRANKIE, MARY JANE, STEVE, AND PHOENIX ---
I couldn't help it
It's all your fault
--- PHOENIX ---
Your love is thick and it swallowed me whole
You're so much braver than I gave you credit for
That's not lip service
--- FRANKIE ---
You're the best listener that I've ever met
--- PHOENIX ---
Let's be best friends
Best friends with benefits
What took me so long
--- FRANKIE ---
I've never felt this healthy before
I've never wanted something rational
I am aware now
--- FRANKIE AND PHOENIX ---
I am aware now
--- Unknown ---
You've already won me over in spite of me
And don't be alarmed if I fall head over feet
And don't be surprised if I love you for all that you are
I couldn't help it
It's all your fault
--- Unknown ---
You've already won me over in spite of me
And don't be alarmed if I fall head over feet
And don't be surprised if I love you for all that you are
I couldn't help it
It's all your fault
--- FRANKIE ---
Knot in my stomach and
--- PHOENIX ---
Lump in my throat
--- JO ---
I went to your house
I walked up the stairs
I opened your door without ringing the bell
I walked down the hall
Into your room
Where I could feel you
And I shouldn't be here without permission
I shouldn't be here
