------ Forgiven ------
--- MARY JANE ---
You know how us Catholic girls can be
I, I.....
We make up for so much time?a?little too late
--- Unknown ---
I?never forgot it, confusing as it?was
No fun with no guilt feelings
The sinners, the saviors, the lover-less priests
I'll see you next Sunday
--- Unknown ---
I sang Alleluia in the choir
--- MARY JANE and Chorus ---
Oh, Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia...
--- MARY JANE ---
I confessed my darkest deeds
--- MARY JANE and Chorus ---
To an envious man
--- MARY JANE with (Chorus) ---
My brothers (no)
They never (no)
Went blind for what they did
But I may as well have (I)
In the name of (Oh)
The Father (Oh)
The Skeptic and the Son
I have one more (one more)
Stupid question (Sinner)
I have my reasons to be here (Witch)
I still have a thing or two to learn (Whore)
I still need something to cling to (ooh)
So I will (you will)
--- MARY JANE and Chorus ---
What I learned I rejected
--- MARY JANE ---
But I believe again
--- MARY JANE and Chorus ---
I will suffer the consequence
--- MARY JANE ---
Of this inquisition
--- MARY JANE and Chorus ---
If I jump in this fountain
--- MARY JANE and (Chorus) ---
Will I be forgiven (forgiven...)
--- Chorus ---
Ooh...
Ooh...
Ooh...
--- MARY JANE ---
We all had our reasons to be there
We all have a thing or two to learn
We all need something to cling to
So we did
--- NICK and Chorus ---
So we did... (so we did)
We all have delusions in our head
We all have our minds made up for us
We have to believe in something
--- FRANKIE and (Chorus) ---
So I will (so I will)
--- ANDREW Chorus ---
We all had our reasons to be there Ave Maria
--- ANDREW AND BELLA ---
We all had our pain to learn Ave Maria
--- ANDREW, BELLA AND PHOENIX ---
We all needed something to cling to Ave Maria
So we did
--- Chorus and (MARY JANE) ---
We all had our reasons to be here (So we did)
We all had a thing or two to learn
We all needed something to cling to
So we did
--- Unknown ---
Amen
