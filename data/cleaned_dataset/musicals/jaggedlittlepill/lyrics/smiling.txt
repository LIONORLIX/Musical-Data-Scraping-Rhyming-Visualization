------ Smiling ------
--- MARY JANE ---
This is a life of extremes
Both sides are slippery and enticing
Here in my places off?the?rails
--- Unknown ---
This loose recollection?of a fallen
Barely remember who I?felt
I was just trying to keep it together
--- Unknown ---
This is the first wave of my white flag (Ah)
This is the sound of me hitting bottom (Ah)
This, my surrender, if that's what you call it
And the anatomy of my crash (Ah)
--- Unknown ---
And I keep on smiling
Keep on moving
Can't stand still
--- Unknown ---
Me, the ceilingless great achiever
Me the notorious perfect mother
Lord to ends of overwhelm
--- Unknown ---
This is the first wave of my white flag (Ah)
This is the sound of me hitting bottom (Ah)
This, my surrender, if that's what you call it
And the anatomy of my crash (Ah)
--- Unknown ---
And I keep on smiling
Keep on moving
Can't stand still
--- Unknown ---
Such pretty forks in the road
On this continuum I've been bound to
Life flashing promise before my eyes
--- Unknown ---
This is the first wave of my white flag (Ah)
This is the sound of me hitting bottom (Ah)
This, my surrender, if that's what you call it (Ah)
And the anatomy of my crash (Ah)
--- Unknown ---
And I keep on smiling
Keep on moving
Can't stand still
Can't stand still
