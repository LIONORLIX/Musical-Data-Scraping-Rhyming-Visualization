------ Overture ------
--- Chorus ---
Swallow it down
--- Unknown ---
It feels so good
--- Unknown ---
What goes around?never?comes around
Wake up
--- Unknown ---
And?all I really want
Is deliverance
A way?to calm the angry voice
--- Unknown ---
These are my words
This is my voice
This is my taste of which you have no part of
--- Unknown ---
(you, you, you, you, you...)
And I'm here to remind you
Of the mess you left when you went away
--- Unknown ---
It's not fair to deny me
Of the cross I bear that you gave to me
--- Unknown ---
You
You
You
You...
