------ Uninvited ------
--- MARY JANE ---
Like anyone would be
I am disturbed by my fascination with you
Like any flesh and a?human
I?have simply found?an object to crave
--- Unknown ---
But you, you're?not allowed
You're uninvited
An unfortunate slight
--- MARY JANE AND BELLA ---
Must be strangely exciting
To watch the stoic squirm
Must be somewhat heartening
To watch the flawless fall from grace
--- MARY JANE ---
But you, you're not allowed
You're uninvited
An unfortunate slight
--- MARY JANE AND BELLA ---
Like any uncharted territory
This must seem greatly intriguing
You speak of my want like
You have experienced want like mine before
--- MARY JANE ---
But this is not allowed
You're uninvited
An unfortunate slight
--- Unknown ---
Though, I found this unnerving
I've had my moment to deliberate
