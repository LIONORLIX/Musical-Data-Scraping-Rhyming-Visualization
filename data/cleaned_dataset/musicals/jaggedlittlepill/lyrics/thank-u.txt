------ Thank U ------
--- Chorus ---
How about me not blaming you for everything?
I'm reaching out to make amends
--- Unknown ---
How about me?enjoying?a moment for?once?
No pressure for you to let?me in
--- FRANKIE ---
How about how good it feels to finally forgive you?
--- Chorus ---
These are no times for the weak of heart
One step, one prayer, I soldier on
--- Unknown ---
Thank you, frailty
Thank you, providence
Thank you, disillusionment
--- Unknown ---
Thank you, clarity
Thank you, consequence
Thank you, thank you silence
--- Unknown ---
The moment I let go it
Was the moment I got more than I could handle
The moment I jumped off of it
Was the moment I touched down
--- Unknown ---
Thank you for seeing me
Thank you for getting me
--- Unknown ---
I see you
