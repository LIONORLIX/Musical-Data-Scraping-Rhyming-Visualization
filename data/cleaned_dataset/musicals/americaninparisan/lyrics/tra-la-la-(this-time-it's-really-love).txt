------ Tra-la-la (This Time It's Really Love) ------
--- JERRY MULLIGAN ---
This time it's really love
Tra-la-la-la
I'm in that blue above
Tra-la-la-la
She fills me full of joy
Tell me, papa.
Am I not a lucky guy?
Just listen to my heart
Go pitterpatter
It's started from the start
I've fallen like that [snap!]
Humming, strumming, singing, drumming
What a thrill
I'm getting from it all
La-la-la
La-la-la
This time it's really love!
--- ADAM COOK ---
To me you're fu-full of bla-bla-bla-bla!
--- JERRY MULLIGAN ---
I've got the grandest love,
Dit moi, papa!
--- ADAM COOK ---
Cherchez la femme toujours.
Ooh-la-la!
--- JERRY MULLIGAN ---
She's got but ev'rything-
--- ADAM COOK ---
Is there a doury?
--- JERRY MULLIGAN ---
She's like a breath of spring-
--- ADAM COOK ---
Wow, you'll be soury!
--- JERRY MULLIGAN ---
Humming, strumming, singing, drumming.
--- ADAM COOK ---
Nothing good to happen from the start!
--- JERRY MULLIGAN AND ADAM COOK ---
Tra-la-la-la
La-la-la
--- ADAM COOK ---

Look, one hand!
--- JERRY MULLIGAN AND ADAM COOK ---
[Singing]
What a thrill
I'm getting from it all
Tra-la-la-la
