------ By Strauss ------
--- HENRI BAUREL ---
The waltzes of Mittel Europa
They charm you and warm you within
While each day discloses
What Broadway composes
Is emptiness pounding on tin.
--- JERRY MULLIGAN: ADAM COOK ---
Mein Herr!
Mein Herr!
Bitte, bitte!
Denke, danke!
Aufwiedersehen! Aufwiedersehen!
--- HENRI BAUREL ---
How can I be civil
When hearing this drivel?
It's only for night-clubbing souses.
Oh give me the free 'n easy
Waltz that is Viennes-y
And go tell the band
If they want a hand
The waltz must be Strauss's
--- ALL ---
Ya ya ya
Give me oom pah pah...
--- HENRI BAUREL ---
When I want a melody
Lilting through the house
Then I want a melody
By Strauss
It laughs, it sings
The world is in rhyme
--- ALL ---
Swinging to three-quarter time
--- HENRI BAUREL ---
Let the Danube flow along
And The Fledermaus!
Keep the wine and give me song
--- ALL ---
By Strauss
By Jo, By Jing!
By Strauss is the thing
--- HENRI BAUREL ---
So I say to ha cha cha
Heraus!
Just give me an oom pah pah
By Strauss!

When I want a melody
Lilting through the house
Then I want a melody
By Strauss
It laughs,
--- JERRY MULLIGAN ---
Ah, ah, ah, ah.
--- HENRI BAUREL ---
It sings
--- JERRY MULLIGAN ---
La, la, la, la, la, la, la.
--- HENRI BAUREL and JERRY MULLIGAN ---
La, la, la, la, la, la, la.
La, la, la, la, la, la, la.
La, la, la!
--- HENRI BAUREL ---
Let the Danube flow along
And The Fledermaus
Keep the wine and give me song
By Strauss
By Jo, By Jing!
--- ADAM COOK ---
Gentlemen, the Emperor!
--- Waltz ---

La, la, la, la, la, la, la.
La, la, la, la, la, la, la...
