------ Nice Work If You Can Get It ------
--- Unknown ---
Holdin' hands at midnight
'neath a starry sky
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try
--- Unknown ---
Strollin' with the one girl
Sighin' sigh after sigh
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try
--- Unknown ---
Just imagine someone
Waiting at the cottage door
Where two hearts become one
Who could ask for anything more?
--- Unknown ---
Loving one who loves you
And then takin' that vow
Nice work if you can get it
And if you get it won't you tell me how?

Sighing sigh after sigh

Where two hearts become one
Who could ask for anything more?

Loving one who loves you
And then takin' that vow
Nice work if you can get it
