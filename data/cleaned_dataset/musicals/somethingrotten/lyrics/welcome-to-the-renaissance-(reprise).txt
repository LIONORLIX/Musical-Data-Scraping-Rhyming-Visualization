Welcome to the Renaissance
Now the stage is set for a huge response
Or an epic failure
And Nick and Nigel Bottom are starting to sweat
Cause they don't have the story written yet

But it's not that easy
And if you're William Shakespeare
You're feeling the heat
To still be new

Welcome to the Renaissance
What's a famous bard to do
