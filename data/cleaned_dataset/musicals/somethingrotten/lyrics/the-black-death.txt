------ The Black Death ------
--- Troupe ---
What's that coming up the Silk Road
Out of China?
The Black Death, Black Death, woo!
--- Unknown ---
What's that creeping round your peepee
And your vagina?
The Black Death, Black Death, woo!
--- Unknown ---
The Black Death,
It's gonna get ya
It's the Black Death,
It's gonna hit ya with those blisters,
Oozing like syrup
That pesty little pestilence is killing half of Europe
It's the Black Death
And it's coming for you
--- Unknown ---
Mmmmmm, mmmmm
The Black Death, Black Death, woo!
Mmmmmm, mmmmm
The Black Death, Black Death, woo!
--- Unknown ---
The Black Death
It's getting closer
It's the Black Death
It's getting grosser
And it's making its way across England
Soon everything that's dangling won't be any good for dingling
--- Unknown ---
It's the Black Death
And it's coming for you
Black Death!
