------ It's Eggs! ------
--- Troupe ---
What's that cooking on the griddle
Whipped up and beaten?
It's eggs, it's eggs, woo!
--- Unknown ---
Throw some fixings in the middle
So good for eating
It's eggs, it's eggs, woo!
--- Nick ---
I see within this fluffy form
The scrambled nature of my soul
I'm cracking up as I begin
To see the bits of me within this

Om-om-om
Omelette!
