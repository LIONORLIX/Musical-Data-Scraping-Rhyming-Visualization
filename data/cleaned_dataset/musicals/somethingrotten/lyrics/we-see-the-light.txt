------ We See the Light ------
--- Portia ---
I'm tired of listening to the same sad story
How lovers fail because it's written in the stars
The feuding family plot is starting to bore me
I'm thinking we can show them that's not who we are
--- Unknown ---
It may take a little more persuading
For those who think it's better that we are apart
I have no doubt their doubts will soon be fading
We'll show them how true love finds a way
Even though I know what they'll say
--- Ensemble ---
No, no that won't do
God has plans for you
If you live in sin
You let the devil win
No, no that won't do
--- Portia ---
But then they'll hear the words of truth that you've written from your heart
--- Nigel ---
If love is a sickness
Then find me no cure
For tis only love
That I know to be pure
--- Ensemble ---
Aww
--- Portia ---
Then they'll think about it
And pray about it
Then their hearts will open
Then they'll be singing a different tune
--- Ensemble ---
We see the light
You changed how we're thinking
Cause we were blind
You showed us the way
We're wrong
You're right
Salvation is yours if you do what is true to you
And you do it with love
Do it with love
Yeah, oh
--- Nigel ---
Your father
--- Portia ---
Yeah
He's a hard man to be moved
And he'll say
--- Brother Jeremiah ---
This is unacceptable
I do not approve
--- Portia ---
But I know you'll win him over
His heart is gonna sing
And he'll love you
When you do your thing
--- Nigel ---
If love is love purely
Then let me opine
That all love is surely divine
--- Brother Jeremiah ---
Good God, y'all
I see the light
You changed how I'm thinking
Cause I was blind
And you've shown me the way
I'm wrong
You're right
--- All ---
Salvation is yours if you do what is true to you
And you do it with love
Do it with love
--- Brother Jeremiah ---
Brethren (Yes)
I say unto you (Say what)
I say who are we to judge these two (So true, preach it)
He's a writer doing what he can (What he can)
She's a daughter of a preacher man (Woo!)
And they got the right to
--- All ---
They got the right
They got the right to be together
--- Brother Jeremiah ---
I need no further proof
These words, they speak the truth (The truth will set you free)
Set you free when you
--- All ---
Do what is true to you
And you do it with
--- Nick ---
Wait
--- Nigel ---
Read
--- Nick ---
Aww
--- Nigel & Portia ---
Yay
--- All ---
Love
Do it with love
Yeah
We see the light
You changed how we're thinking
Cause we were blind
You showed us the way
We're wrong
You're right
Salvation is yours if you do what is true to you
And you do it with love
Do it with love
Love
Do it with love
We see the light
