------ God, I Hate Shakespeare (Reprise) ------
--- Nick ---
God, I hate Shakespeare
But when I sit and really contemplate Shakespeare
I guess I hate the fact that he is everything I ever dreamed that I could be
I mostly hate the way he makes me feel about me
Cause the truth is
--- Unknown ---
It wouldn't be that bad to be Shakespeare
In fact, I'd give my left gnad to be Shakespeare
If I could only have one tiny little smidgen of his notoriety
It would relieve me of these pressures of responsibility
--- Unknown ---
I've gotta make it happen
Gotta find that pot of gold
If there was just some way to know just what the future holds
