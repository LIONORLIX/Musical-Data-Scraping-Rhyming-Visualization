------ Right Hand Man (Reprise) ------
--- Bea ---
What stops us from walking out on him? I think it's because you know like I know.
--- Unknown ---
(Sung)
If you ever got in trouble
He would be there on the double just to bail you out
If there's anything you lack
You know he's always got your back
That's what he's all about
--- Unknown ---
He has his faults but he means well
And he always does the best that he can
But it should be understood
I wouldn't change him if I could
Cause I know his heart is good
--- Unknown ---
And he'll always be your right hand man
--- Unknown ---
(Spoken)
He can't do this without you, maybe it's time you carry him for a bit.
--- Nigel ---
Okay, I will
--- Bea ---
Good and I'm sure you'll give them a show they'll never forget!
