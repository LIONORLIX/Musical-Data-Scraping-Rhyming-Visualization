------ Right Hand Man ------
--- Unknown ---
If you ever got in trouble
I would be there on the double
Just to bail you out
--- Unknown ---
If there's anything you lack
You know I've always got your back
Thats what its all about
--- Unknown ---
Think of me as your sidekick
Helping you whenever I can
I'm more than just a woman, baby
When the pressure's coming baby
Let me be your right hand man
--- Unknown ---
(But your not a man, I'm the man)
UGH,  your not hearing me
--- Unknown ---
If you're ever in a pickle
You can call for me and quick'll
Be how fast I run
--- Unknown ---
(I'm not in a pickle)
--- Unknown ---
You and me should be a team
For any dream or any scheme
That's how it should be done
--- Unknown ---
Sure I could stay in the background
Just smiling every now and again
But just to be a pretty lady
That would be a pity baby
Let me be your right hand man
--- Unknown ---
(You should listen to her, she's usually right)
--- Unknown ---
I am stronger than you think
Don't be thinking I ain't tough
I am where you oughta go
When the goings getting rough
--- Unknown ---
So when things are going badly
But if they weren't
Love (what) UGHHH
Quit trying to protect me
--- Unknown ---
Not until I know that
--- Unknown ---
If you're ever in a fix
And its a fix you need to nix
Then I'm your go to guy
Don't be so literal
--- Unknown ---
And don't forget I'm not a shrinking violet
A solid rock am I
So don't be thinking I'll crumble
When the you know what hits the fan
--- Unknown ---
There's no problem thats to big
When your married thats the gig
So don't be a sexist pig
--- Unknown ---
Is it asking to much of you
It's only cuz I love you
Let me be your right
In fact I'll show you that I'm right
--- Unknown ---
(What are you doing now?)
I'm going to get you boys some meat
--- Unknown ---
