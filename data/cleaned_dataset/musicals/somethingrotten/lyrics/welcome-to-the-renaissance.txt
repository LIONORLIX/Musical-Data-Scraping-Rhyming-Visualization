------ Welcome to the Renaissance ------
--- Lyrics ---
War of the roses chaucer’s tales
The brutal feudal system
Holy crusades
Bubonic plague
Can’t say that we’ve really missed them
--- Unknown ---
So dark and barbaric,
So dull and mundane
That was so middle ages
That was so charlemagne
--- Unknown ---
Welcome to the renaissance
With poets, painters and bon vivants
And merry minstrels, who
Stroll the streets of london
A-strumming their lutes
And puffy pants and pointy leather boots
--- Unknown ---
Welcome to the renaissance
Where we ooh and aah here
With ambiance
We’re so progressive
The latest and the greatest
We bring it to you
With much ado
Welcome to the renaissance
Where everything is new
--- Unknown ---
Here we’ve made advances in the sciences
We have the latest gadgets and appliances
Our mugs are made of pewter
Our houses all are tudor
Decorated with a modern flair
--- Unknown ---
See us in our petticoats and farthingales
Our trendy beards we trim to look like swallow tails
--- Unknown ---
We’re called elizabethans
They’re all a bunch of heathens
Heathens heading straight for you-know-where
--- Unknown ---
While witches are burning and wars tend to start
We bring you moments of culture and art
--- Unknown ---
Welcome to the renaissance
Where our printing press has the fancy fonts
That’s right we’re fancy
And very literary
Theatrical too
It’s what we do
Welcome to the renaissance
Where everything is new
--- Unknown ---
Hey look it’s francis bacon with a chicken
What’s he makin’?
Well i think he’s found a way of freezing meat
That’s new
--- Unknown ---
Hey look it’s walter raleigh
Found a new world, by golly,
And he’s brought us all tobacco, what a treat
Also new
--- Unknown ---
And we have a list of writers who
Are always writing something new
It’s true we do
Like who?
Like who?!
--- Unknown ---
Like dekker
John webster
Ben jonson
And christopher marlowe
--- Unknown ---
Thomas kyd
Thomas middleton
Thomas more
--- Unknown ---
And our brightest star yo
He’s the bomb
The soul of the age
The wiz of the elizabethan stage
He’s incredible
Unforgettable
He’s just so freakin’ awesome
Shakespeare
Shakespeare
--- Unknown ---
We love him (x8)
--- Unknown ---
His brains are so brilliant
His writing’s first rate
His acting’s is incredible
Isn’t he great
--- Unknown ---
We love him (x4)
We love him (x2)
We love him
--- Unknown ---
Welcome to the renaissance
Not the one in italy or in france
No one in england
The one where william shakespeare
Is cream of the crop
The one where william shakespeare is the top
--- Unknown ---
Welcome to the renaissance
The 16th century experience
The age that’s golden
The olden days are over
We bid them adieu
Well hallelu-
--- Unknown ---
Welcome to the renaissance
Where everything is new
Where everything is new
Welcome to the renaissance
Where everything is new
