------ Hard to Be the Bard ------
--- SHAKESPEARE ---
My days are so busy it's making me dizzy
There's so much I gotta do
There's lunches and meetings and poetry readings
and endless interviews
Gotta pose for a portrait
and how I deplore sitting there for eternity
Then it's off to the inn
Where my innkeeper friend
Wants to name a drink after me
Then it's back to my room, where I resume
My attempt to write a hit
Just me and my beer and the terrible fear
That I might be losing it
--- Unknown ---
And it's hard,
--- MAN SERVANTS ---
It's hard
--- SHAKESPEARE ---
It's hard,
--- MAN SERVANTS ---
It's hard
--- SHAKESPEARE ---
It's really hard
So very very hard
--- MAN SERVANTS ---
It's really hard
Very very hard
--- SHAKESPEARE ---
I make it look easy but honey believe me
It's hard
--- MAN SERVANTS ---
It's hard
--- SHAKESPEARE ---
It's hard,
--- MAN SERVANTS ---
It's hard
--- SHAKESPEARE ---
It's so
--- SHAKESPEARE & MAN SERVANTS ---
Incredibly hard
So inconceivably, unbelievably hard
--- SHAKESPEARE ---
It's hard to be the bard
--- Unknown ---
Honestly, I don't know how I do it. There's only so much of me to go around.
--- Unknown ---
I've got so many fans
With so many demands
I can hardly go take a piss
--- MAN SERVANTS ---
He can't pee
--- SHAKESPEARE ---
Be it theater-freak or
The autograph-seeker
They all want a piece of this
--- MAN SERVANTS ---
Gimme, Gimme
--- SHAKESPEARE ---
It's a cross that I bear,
I'm like Jesus, I swear
It's a burden but I suffer through it
--- MAN SERVANTS ---
He is suffering
--- SHAKESPEARE ---
It's all part of the game,
The trappings of fame
But somebody's gotta do it
--- MAN SERVANTS ---
So he does it
--- SHAKESPEARE ---
And I know, I know, I gotta go
And get back to my pen and ink
Oh don't make me do it,
Don't make me go through it
Can somebody get me a drink!
--- Unknown ---
'Cause it's hard
--- MAN SERVANTS ---
It's hard
--- SHAKESPEARE ---
It's hard,
--- MAN SERVANTS ---
It's hard
--- SHAKESPEARE ---
It's really really hard
It's sexy but it's hard
--- MAN SERVANTS ---
It's really hard
Sexy but it's hard
--- SHAKESPEARE ---
This bar that I'm
Raising to be this amazing!
It's hard,
--- MAN SERVANTS ---
It's hard
--- SHAKESPEARE ---
It's hard,
--- MAN SERVANTS ---
It's hard
--- SHAKESPEARE ---
It's so
--- SHAKESPEARE & MAN SERVANTS ---
Annoyingly hard
So unavoidably, unenjoyably hard
--- SHAKESPEARE ---
It's hard to be the bard, baby
--- Unknown ---
I know writing made me famous, but being famous is just so much more fun. You see...
--- Unknown ---
What people just don't understand
Is that writing's demanding
It's mentally challenging and it's a bore
It's such a chore
TO sit in a room by yourself
--- Unknown ---
Oh my god, I just hate it!
--- Unknown ---
And you're trying to find
An opening line or a brilliant idea
And you're pacing the floor
And hoping for just a bit of divine intervention
That one little nugget that one little spark
Then Eureka! You find it you're ready to start
So now you can write, right? Wrong!
You're not even close, you remember that damn it,
Your play's gotta be in iambic pentameter!
So you write down a word but it's not the right word,
So you try a new word but you hate the new word
And you need a good word but you can't find the word
Oh where is it, what is it, what is it, where is it!
Blah-blah-blah, ha ha, ah-ha -UGHHHHHHHH!
--- VALET ---
Sir.
--- SHAKESPEARE ---
Hello.
--- VALET ---
You asked for information on what Nicholas Bottom is writing. Our spy is here with the news.
--- SHAKESPEARE ---
Did he see me losing it?
--- VALET ---
He's half blind, sir.
--- SHAKESPEARE ---
Oh, good. Then he only saw half of it. You see what I did? Ha ha. Speak, man. What news?
--- EYEPATCH MAN ---
I saw Nick Bottom, I did. He paid a soothsayer to foresee what Shakespeare's greatest play would be.
--- SHAKESPEARE ---
That sneaky little thief! Why doesn't he come up with his own ideas!?
--- MAN SERVANTS ---
It's hard
--- SHAKESPEARE ---
No. It is, isn't it?
It's really the worst
--- MAN SERVANTS ---
It's hard
--- SHAKESPEARE ---
Makes me wonder why I didn't think of that first
--- MAN SERVANTS ---
It's hard
--- SHAKESPEARE ---
Hard to alleviate the pressure to create
--- MAN SERVANTS ---
It's hard
--- SHAKESPEARE ---
Hard to do something as good as the last thing I did that was already great
--- MAN SERVANTS ---
It's hard
--- SHAKESPEARE ---
It's hard,
--- MAN SERVANTS ---
So hard that he is stealing from the bard
--- SHAKESPEARE ---
Well I'll hoist him by his petard
All I need is a clever disguise
--- MAN SERVANTS ---
Clever disguise
--- SHAKESPEARE ---
I'll make him pay for those devious lies
--- MAN SERVANTS ---
Devious lies
--- SHAKESPEARE ---
Let him do all the tedious stuff
The work that's terribly and unbearably hard
Cause it's hard
--- MAN SERVANTS ---
It's totally hard
--- SHAKESPEARE & MAN SERVANTS ---
It's hard
--- MAN SERVANTS ---
It's totally hard
--- SHAKESPEARE & MAN SERVANTS ---
It's hard
--- MAN SERVANTS ---
It's totally hard
--- SHAKESPEARE ---
I've got fortune and fame
Everyone knows my name
I can't help it if it's so freakin' hard
