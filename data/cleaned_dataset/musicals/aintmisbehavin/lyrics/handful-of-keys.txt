------ Handful Of Keys ------
--- Unknown ---
I like to tinkle on an old piana.
I like to play it in a subtle mannah.
I get a lot o' pleasure
With a spano' keys
Underneath my finger tips.
Tricklin' off o' my lips.
A handful o' keys
And a song to sing,
Now how could you ask for more?
Than ticklin' the ivory,
Singin' jive,
I repeat what I said before.

I like to sing a little tune that's mellah.
I like to vocalize,
There's nothin' swellah.
I love to have a supple melody
Just tricklin' off o' my lips.
A handful o' keys
And a song to sing,
Now how could you ask for more?
Than ticklin' the ivory,
Singin' jive,
I repeat what I said before.

I like to tinkle on an old piana.
I like to play it in a subtle mannah.
I know I'll always be the top banana
