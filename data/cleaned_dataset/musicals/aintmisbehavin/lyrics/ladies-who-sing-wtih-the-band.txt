------ Ladies Who Sing wtih the Band ------
--- Unknown ---
There's an inn in Indiana with a very goodly clientele
Of junior jerks from the boiler works who thought her singin' swell
She'd a voice so sweet an' low, I guess her dress was even lower still
--- Unknown ---
Sellin' vocals,
Hmm,
To those yokels
HMMM! Hmm...mmmm
Was her first important thrill
Important thrill
--- Unknown ---
Should your career need a springboard
Here is the best in the land
Rise and rejoice, for you don't need a voice
Join the ladies who sing with the band
--- Unknown ---
Who's in the hollywood spotlight (who?)
Who do producers demand?
There making Duses of all the chanteuses,
The ladies who sing with the band
--- Unknown ---
Flat tone, that tone (wah?)
Can never hurt a singer with curves
You'll see fans stand, around your band stand
--- Unknown ---
If you've a tropical torso,
And your digestion is grand
You may do finer than Ginny or Dinah,
The ladies who sing with the band
--- Spoken ---
--- Unknown ---
Say, cat
Yeah?
Who was that singer I saw you with last night
Oh, 'dat wasn't no singer
Wait a minute!
You mean to tell me you didn't admire that girls beautifully-rounded toes
Ha Ha! I was surprised to see her up there
I didn't know she could sing that way
Never could!
Well, how'd she get that job
One never knows, do one?

If you've a tropical torso, (if you've a tropical torso)
And your digestion is grand (and your digestion is)
You may do finer than Ginny or Dinah, or Dottie, or Janet or Helen or Ina
They don't to know from a major or minor
