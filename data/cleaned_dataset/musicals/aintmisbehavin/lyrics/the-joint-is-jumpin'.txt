------ The Joint Is Jumpin' ------
--- Unknown ---
They have a new expression,
along ol' Harlem way.
That tells you when a party
is ten times more than gay
To say that things are jumpin'
leaves not a single doubt.
That everything is in full swing
when you hear someone shout Here 'tis:
--- Unknown ---
This joint is jumpin',
It's really jumpin',
Come in cats an' check your hats,
I mean this joint is jumpin'.
The piano's thumpin',
The dancers bumpin'.
This here spot is more than hot,
In fact the joint is jumpin',
--- Unknown ---
Check your weapons at the door,
Be sure to pay your quarter.
Burn your leather on the floor,
Grab anybody's daughter.
The roof is rockin',
The neighbor's knockin'.
We're all bums when the wagon comes.
I mean this joint is jumpin'.
--- Spoken ---
Let it be! Yas!
Burn this joint, boy!
Yas!
Oh, my! Yas!
Don't you hit that chick, that's my broad!
Where'd you get that stuff at?
Why, I'll knock you to your knees!
What?
Put this cat out of here!
What?
Get rid of that pistol! Get rid of that pistol! Yeah! Get rid of it, yas!
Yeah!
That's what I'm talkin' about! Ha, ha! Yas!
Now it's really ready!
No, baby, not now, I can't come over there right now.
Yeah, let's do it!
[Party noises and shouting]
--- Unknown ---
The joint is jumpin',
It's really jumpin',
Ev'ry mose is on his toes,
I mean this joint is jumpin'.
No time for talkin',
It's tim for walkin'
Grab a jug an' cut the rug,
I mean this joint is jumpin'.
Get your pig feet, beer an' gin,
There's plenty in the kitchen.
Who is that that just came in?
Just look at the way he's switchin'.
Don't mind the hour,
'Cause I'm in power.
I got bail if we go to jail.
I mean this joint is jumpin'.
This joint is jumpin',
It's really jumpin',
We're all bums when the wagon comes.
I mean this joint is jumpin'.
Don't give your right name.
No, no, no!
