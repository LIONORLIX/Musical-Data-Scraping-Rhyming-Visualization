I`d work for you, I`d even slave for you
I`d be a beggar or a knave for you (whatever that is)
And if that isn`t love, it`ll have to do
Until the real thing comes along
--- Unknown ---
I`d gladly move the earth for you
To prove my love, dear, and its worth for you
If that isn`t love, it will have to do (gotta do)
Until the real thing comes along
--- Unknown ---
With all the words, dear, at my command
I just can`t make you understand
I`ll always love you, darling, come what may
My heart is yours, what more can I say?
--- Unknown ---
I`d sigh for you, yes, I`d even cry for you, yes
I`d tear the stars down from the skies for you
If that isn`t love, well skip it, it`ll have to do
Until the real thing comes along
--- Unknown ---
Listen baby
I`d even sigh for you, I`m `bout ready to cry for you
I`d tear the stars down from the skies for you
If that isn`t love, it`ll have to do, baby, yes
Until the real thing comes along
