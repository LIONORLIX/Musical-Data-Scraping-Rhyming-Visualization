------ I'm Gonna Sit Right Down & Write Myself a Letter ------
--- Unknown ---
I'm gonna sit right down and write myself a letter
And make believe it came from you
--- Unknown ---
I'm gonna write words, oh, so sweet
They're gonna knock me off my feet,
A lotta kisses on the bottom,
I'll be glad I got 'em
--- I'm gonna smile and say ---
Gee, I hope you're feeling better.
And close with love the way you .
I'm gonna sit right down and write myself a letter
And make believe it came,
