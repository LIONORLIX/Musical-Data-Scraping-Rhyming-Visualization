------ Black And Blue ------
--- Unknown ---
Cold, empty bed,
Springs hard as lead,
Pains in my head,
Feel like old Ned.
What did I do
To be so black and blue?
--- Unknown ---
No joys for me,
No company,
Even the mouse
Ran from my house,
All my life through
I've been so
Black and blue.
--- Unknown ---
I'm so forlorn,
Life's just a thorn,
My heart is torn,
Why was I born?
What did I do to be so
Black and blue?
--- Unknown ---
I'm white inside,
But that don't help my case.
'Cause I can't hide
What is on my face,
Oh!
--- Unknown ---
[Alternative lyrics
for the last verse]
I'm sad inside,
But it don't help my case
'Cause I can't hide
All the sorrow
