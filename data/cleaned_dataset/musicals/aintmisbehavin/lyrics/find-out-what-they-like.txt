I used to wonder right along, I mean why I couldn't hold a man
I used to wonder too
Every love affair went wrong, until I changed my plan
We're having no more trouble now
My daddies nice as he can be, oh sweetheart mine's better, hahaha
Ladies, I will tell you how, that's if you'll take a tip from me
--- Unknown ---
Find out what they like, and how they like it, and let him have it just that way
Give them what they want, and when they want it, without a single word to say
--- Unknown ---
You got to cater to a man and if you don't, day and night,
he'll find some other gal to do the things you won't, whoo hoo
--- Unknown ---
Find out what they like, and how they like it, and let him have it just that way
Find out what they like, and how they like it, and let him have it just that way
Give em what they want, and when they want it, without a single word to say
--- Unknown ---
Just use some more suger if he says your jam ain't sweet,
trust him, or he will seek for his dessert across the street
So, find out what they like, and how they like it, and let him have it just that way
--- Unknown ---
Hey McQueen, how'd you get that man you were with last night?
Well I stole him.
Oh stop, his girlfriends pretty
And skinnyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
--- Unknown ---
Find out what they like, and how they like it, and let him have it just that way
Give them what they want, and when they want it, without a single word to say
--- Unknown ---
Now you will lose him if you give him lollipops,
when you know he's crazy just to have some chops
--- Unknown ---
Find out what they like, and how they like it, and let him have it just that way
--- Unknown ---
Find out what they like, and how they like it, and let him have it just that way
Give them what they want, and when they want it, without a single word to say
--- Unknown ---
Now if he claims his lodge is meeting every night,
that means you don't handle all your business right
--- Unknown ---
So......find out what they like, and how they like it, and let him have it just that way
and let him have it just that way
and let him have it just that way
Way!!!!!!!!!!
