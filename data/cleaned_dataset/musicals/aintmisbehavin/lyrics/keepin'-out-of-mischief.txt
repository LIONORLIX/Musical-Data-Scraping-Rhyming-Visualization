------ Keepin' Out Of Mischief ------
--- Unknown ---
Keepin' out of mischief now
I really am in love and how
I'm through playin' with fire
It's you whom I desire
--- Unknown ---
All the world can plainly see
You're the only one for me
I have told them in advance
They can't break up our romance
Livin' up to all my vows
'Cause I'm keepin' out mischief now

Keepin' out of mischief now

They can't break up our romance
Livin' up to all my vows
'Cause I'm keepin' out mischief
Oh, yeah!
Keepin' out of mischief
Oh, yeah!
Keepin' out of mischief now!

5.The Joint Is Jumpin'
Lyrics by Andy Razaf and J. C. Johnson
Music by Thomas Fats Waller
--- Unknown ---
The joint is jumpin',
It's really jumpin',
Come in cats an' check your hats,
I mean this joint is jumpin'.
The piano's thumpin',
The dancers bumpin'.
This here spot is more than hot,
In fact the joint is jumpin',
--- Unknown ---
Check your weapons at the door,
Be sure to pay your quarter.
Burn your leather on the floor,
grab aybody's daughter.
The roof is rockin',
The neighbor's knockin'.
We're all bums when the wagon comes.
I mean this joint is jumpin'.
Let it beat!
--- Unknown ---
The joint is jumpin',
It's really jumpin',
Ev'ry mose is on his toes,
I mean this joint is jumpin'.
No time for talkin',
It's tim for walkin'
Grab a jug an' cut the rug,
I mean this joint is jumpin'.
Get your pig feet, beer an' gin,
There's plenty in the kitchen.
Who is that that just came in?
Just look at the way he's switchin'.
Don't mind the hour,
'Cause I'm in power.
I got bail if we go to jail.
I mean this joint is jumpin'.
This joint is jumpin',
It's really jumpin',
We're all bums when the wagon comes.
I mean this joint is jumpin'.
Don't give your right name.
