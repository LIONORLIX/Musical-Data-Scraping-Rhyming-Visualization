Lookin' Good But Feelin' Bad
From grievein' over you,
Lookin' good to hide those bitter blues.
--- Unknown ---
Weary days and lonely nights
I'm waiting here for you,
Hopin' that my love you won't refuse.
Roh doh doh doh doh doh doh
Roh doh doh doh doh
Roh doh doh doh doh doh doh
Bah bah bah bah bah bah bah

When I'm feelin' blue
