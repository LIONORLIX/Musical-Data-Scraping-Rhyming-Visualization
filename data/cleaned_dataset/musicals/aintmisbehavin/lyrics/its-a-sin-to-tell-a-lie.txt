------ Its A Sin To Tell A Lie ------
--- Unknown ---
Be sure it's true when you say
I love you
It's a sin to tell a lie
Millions of hearts have been broken
Just because these words were spoken
--- Unknown ---
I love you
Yes I do
I love you
If you break my heart I'll die
So be sure that it's true when you say
I love you
