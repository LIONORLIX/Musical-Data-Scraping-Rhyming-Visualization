------ Fat And Greasy ------
--- Unknown ---
Watch Him while he's Sitting There
Chunks Of Fat Hanging Over His Chair
Oil Just Oozing From his Hair
Fat And Greasy as a Grizzly Bear
--- Unknown ---
They Say That Sweet Perfumes Are Made From Fat
But Not The Kind That comes From This Greasy Cat
There's Fragrance In His Clothes
Seems Like Nothing you Ever smelled in a Rose
--- Unknown ---
Man That Fool Is Fat and Greasy
Hot or Cool He's Fat And Greasy
Here To Here He's Fat and Greasy
Oh A Big Fat Greasy Fool
--- Unknown ---
He's Got Big fat Liver Lips
Shakes like Jelly 'Round His Hips
He's a Waddlin' Wiggling Shame
And his Big Fat Whats It's Name
Ha Ha ! Look at That Guy Up There in the Spotlight
Look Who's Calling Names
When she Got Through Dancing with This Fool
Man She Didn't Smell The Same
