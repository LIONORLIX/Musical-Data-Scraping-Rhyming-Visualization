------ Honeysuckle Rose ------
--- Unknown ---
Ev'ry honey bee fills with jealousy
When they see you out with me.
I don't blame them, goodness knows,
Honeysuckle Rose.
--- Unknown ---
When you're passin' by flowers droop and sigh,
And I know the reason why.
You're much sweeter, goodness knows,
Honeysuckle Rose.
--- Unknown ---
Don't buy sugar,
You just have to touch my cup,
You're my sugar,
It's sweet when you stir it up.
--- Unknown ---
When I'm takin' sips from your tasty lips,
Seems the honey fairly drips,
You're confection, goodness knows,
