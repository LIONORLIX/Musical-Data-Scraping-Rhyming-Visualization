------ That Ain't Right ------
--- Girl ---
Baby, Baby, What is the matter with you?
Oh, Oh, Baby, Baby, What is the matter with you?
You've got the world in your arms, and you've got nothin to lose.
Well, you know I always told ya, that you'd be the death of me?
And when I'm always with ya, I get the third degree!
Now that a'int right, no that a'int right at all.
That you're takin all my money, and goin out, havin yourself a ball.
--- Boy ---
Last night I called your number,
and I got this big hello.
Now, I know you got a big voice,
but I swear it a'int that low!
That a'int right,
no, that a'int right at all.
That you're takin all my lovin',
and goin out, havin yourself a ball.
--- Girl ---
I went to a frtune teller,
and I had my fortune told.
She said you didn't love me!
You just want me for my gold.
That a'int right,
no, that a'int right at all.
That your takin all my money,
and goin aout, havin yourself a ball.
