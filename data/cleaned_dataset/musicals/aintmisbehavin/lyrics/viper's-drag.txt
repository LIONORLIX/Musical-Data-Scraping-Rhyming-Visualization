------ Viper's Drag ------
--- Unknown ---
I dreamed about a refer, five feet long.
A might immense, but not to strong.
You'll be high, but not for long.... if you're a viper.
--- Unknown ---
I'm the king, of everything.
I've got to get high before I swing.
Your bell will be ringing, ding dong ding....if you're a viper.
