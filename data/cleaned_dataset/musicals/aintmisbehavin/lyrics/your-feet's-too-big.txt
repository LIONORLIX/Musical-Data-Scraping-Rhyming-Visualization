------ Your Feet's Too Big ------
--- Fats Waller Version of Lyrics ---
--- Unknown ---
Who's that walkin' round here, Mercy
Sounds like baby patter, baby elephant patter thats what I calls it
Say up in Harlem at a table for two
There were four of us,
me, your big feet and you
From your ankles up, I'd say you sure look sweet
From there down there's just too much feet
Yes, your feets too big
Don't want ya, cause ya feets too big
Can't use ya, cause ya feets too big
I really hate ya, cause ya feets too big
Do wahs etc
Where did ya get em
Your girl she likes you, she thinks you're nice
Got what it takes to be in paradise
She likes your face
She likes your (???)
Man oh man those things are too big
Your feets too big
Don't want cha, cause ya feets too big
Mad at you, cause your feets too big
I hate you, cause your feets too big
----my goodness (words missing) ----shiff shiff shiff
Oh your (peddelick ???) extremities are colossal
To me you look just like a fossil
Got me walkin', talkin' and squarkin''
Cause your feets too big
Yeah, Come on and walk that thing
Oh I've never heard of such walkin', Mercy
Your (???) extremities really are obnoxious
one never knows do one

Who's that walkin' round here, Mercy
Say at a diner at a table for two
There are four of us,
me, your big feet and you
From your ankles up, you sure look sweet
From there down there's just too much feet
Yeah, your feets too big
Don't want ya, cause ya feets too big
Can't use ya, cause ya feets too big
I really hate ya, cause ya feets too big
Yeah, let's hear it now
Where did ya get em
Your baby she likes you, she thinks you're nice
Got what it takes to be in, ar paradise
She likes your face
She likes your (???)
Man oh man them things are too big
Oh your feets too big
Can't Twist, cause ya feets too big
Can't Shake it, cause your feets too big
You just don't make it, cause your feets too big
Come on walk that thing
Never heard such walkin' Mercy
Where'd ya get em
Oh your (???) extremities are colossal
To me you look just like a fossil
You've got me walkin', talkin' and squarkin''
Your feets too big, too big, too large
Yeah, your feets too big
Don't want cha, cause your feets too big
I can't stand ya, cause your feets too big
I'm mad at cha, cause ya feets too big
Hey,
Where'd ya get em
Your (???) extremities really are obnoxious
