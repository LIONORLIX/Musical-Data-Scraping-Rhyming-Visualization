------ 'Tain't Nobody's Bizness if I Do ------
--- Unknown ---
There ain't nothin' I can do
Or nothing I can say
That folks don't criticize me
But I'm gonna do what I want to anyway
And I don't care just what people say
If I should take a notion to jump into the ocean
'T ain't nobody's bizness if I do
If I go to church on Sunday then cabaret all day Monday
'T ain't nobody's bizness if I do
If my man ain't got no money and I say take all mine honey
'T ain't nobody's bizness if I do
If I give him my last nickel and it leaves me in a pickle
'T ain't nobody's bizness if I do
I'd rather my man would hit me
Than for him to jump up and quit me
'T ain't nobody's bizness if I do
I swear I won't call no coppa if I'm beat up by my poppa
'T ain't nobody's bizness if I do
Nobody's bizness, ain't nobody's bizness
