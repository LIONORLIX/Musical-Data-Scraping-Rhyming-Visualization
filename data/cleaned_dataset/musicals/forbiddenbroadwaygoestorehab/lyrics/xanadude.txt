------ Xanadude ------
--- WOMAN ---
A show
That nobody thought would last
Left all New York aghast
They called it Xanadu
And now
We're up there with the best
What a fun retrofest
How better can you do?
Some fancy roller skating
And here we are
A hit so far
And yet our shining star
Is our leading man
So meet Cheyenne
Xanadude
--- CHEYENNE ---
I'm the gay Elvis
--- WOMAN ---
Xanadude
--- CHEYENNE ---
Look at my thighs
--- WOMAN ---
What attitude
Xanadude
The singing Rock Hudson
Xanadude
Please fertilize
Each blue-haired prude
Cheyenne Jackson please do something rude
Go nude
Xanadude
--- CHEYENNE ---
Who cares
If I sing like John Raitt
My big blue eyes look great
When I smile and look out
And man
You'll love my perfect tan
Likewise my perfect pan
Will get you all shook up
--- WOMAN ---
Have you never been hetero?
--- SHIAN (spoken) ---
No?
--- WOMAN ---
Have you never tried
To touch that feeling deep inside you
--- BOTH ---
Xanadude
--- CHEYENNE ---
Don't run away girl
--- BOTH ---
Xanadude
--- CHEYENNE ---
Perfect for play girl
--- WOMAN ---
One sexy dude
--- BOTH ---
No aptitude
A little rude
He's/I'm Xanadude
--- WOMAN ---
Nothing subdued
It's like fast food
--- BOTH ---
He's/I'm Xanadude
Xanadude!
