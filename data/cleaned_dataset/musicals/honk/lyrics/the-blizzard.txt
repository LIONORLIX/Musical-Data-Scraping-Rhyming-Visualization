------ The Blizzard ------
--- Unknown ---
SOLOIST 1
The sun is cold and watery.
The ponds are deeply frozen.
Of all the times for traveling,
It's not one we'd have chosen.
--- Unknown ---
SOLOIST 2
The sky is grey and menacing.
A blizzard would seem certain.
Even good King Wenceslas
Would not draw back his curtain.
--- ALL ---
Aha-ah-aha-ah-aha-ah-ah
Aha-ah-aha-ah-aha-ah-ah
Ah-ah-aha!
--- Unknown ---
The weather's turned out nice again
But sadly for our hero,
The wind chill factor tends to keep
The temperature sub-zero.
--- Unknown ---
The biting cold,
The swirling snow,
It's hard tp catch a breath
And though we hate to say the word,
They're facing certain-
Facing certain-
Facing certain-
--- Unknown ---
The wind has blown the snow in drifts,
To beautiful for words.
It my look good for Christmas cards
But not for cats and birds.
