------ Play With Your Food ------
--- Cat ---
You can scratch the antique furniture
To sharpen up your claws
You can lacerate the cusions if your ever stuck indoors
You can dig up all the flowers from the freshly planted beds
And with articles of clothing it's ok to pull some threads
But I remember as a kindergarden kitten
One phrase that left me singularly smitten
--- Unknown ---
You can play with your food before you eat it
You can chivvy your chow before you chew
You can play with your food you can't beat it
So ducky let me play with you
You can play with your food before you bite it
You can toy with your tuck before the crunch
You can play with your food why fight it
It's a crazy little game called lunch
So tell me ducky, what would you like to play?
It can be anything, I wont tell your mother...

Ugly: Well, I'd like to paddle in the puddles
Dabble in the mud
Tickle stickle becks in the shallows
Then maybe if theres time go sliding in the slime
To the marsh where you find marshmallows
I'll go and slay a dragonfly
Watch water boatmen race
To say that cats are dangerous is clearly not the case
--- Unknown ---
Cat: I'd rather play a game thats sharp and witty
And preferrably with something in the kitty
Oh, you wanna play hide'n'seek do you? Where are you?
Am I getting warmer?
(very fast) You can play with your food before you eat it
You can chivvy your chow before you chew
You can play with your food you can't beat it
So ducky ducky ducky ducky ducky ducky ducky ducky
Ducky let me play with you
You can play with your food before you bite it
You can toy with your tuck before the crunch
You can play with your food why fight it
It's a crazy little game...
(to ugly) Do you like oranges?
Ugly: I dunno, I've never tried one.
Cat: Well suck on this!
It's a crazy little game called lunch
