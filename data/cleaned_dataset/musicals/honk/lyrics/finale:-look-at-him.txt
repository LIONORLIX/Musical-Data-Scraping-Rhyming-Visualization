------ Finale: Look At Him ------
--- All ---
Look at him,
Did you ever see a finner bird?
Hark at him,
'Cause his honking is the best we've heard.
--- Unknown ---
We are feeling rather small,
In this whole sha-bang.
Maybe you'll forgive us all,
And we hope, with enough soft soap, lead our gang
---  NOT SUNG  ---
--- Ugly ---
Of course I forgive you. I'm just happy to see you all again,
and to introduce you to someone. This is Penny.
--- Penny ---
Hello.
--- Grace ---
Welcome home, my dear. I've been thinking,
I'm getting very long in the bill,
and I feel the time is right for me to relinquish the Red Band...
Wear it with pride, my dear, for you are indeed the finest bird on the lake,
as I know I was in my day.
And! let it it be known that from this day forth,
the Red Band shall be known as the Cygnet Rings!
---  ALL APPLAUD, SINGING CONTINUES  ---
--- All ---
Look at him,
Look at us,
See the difference.
--- Unknown ---
Why did we every think him a dud?
Drake:
I always knew that my family was blessed with royal blood.
---  NOT SUNG  ---
--- Turkey ---
Yes! YES!! YES!!!
--- All ---
What?!
--- Turkey ---
I made it through Christmas!
---  CHEERS AND CLAPS  ---
--- Unknown ---
All: Look at him
All the splendour of a noble swan
Look at him
From a duckling to a paragon
--- Unknown ---
Now that you're back on the lake
Promise you won't leave
You're example's there to take
Just believe in yourself
Don't be left on the shelf
Feeling that all hope is dead and gone
And you may find in your own way
You're a swan,
