------ Now I've Seen You ------
--- Ugly ---
I've seen butterflies on blue bells
Drinking in the dew.
Cobwebbs in the sunlight
Shining, I've seen them too.
I've seen woodlands in the autumn,
Falling leaves of every shade and hue.
I thought I knew what beautiful was
But now I've seen you.....
--- Unknown ---
I've seen waterfalls cascadeing
Sparkling in the light.
Damsel flies that dance their
Dance from morning 'til night.
I've seen rainbows reaching skyward
Passing through the clouds then fade from view.
I though I knew what beautiful was
But now I've seen you....
--- Unknown ---
And though I've seen
The willow's weeping branches,
The misty morning air,
A clear and starry night
Has nothing to compare with you....
--- Unknown ---
I've seen swallows in the summer
Wheeling over head.
I have seen the silk worm
Spinning gossamer thread.
I have seen the golden sunset
Over the horizon painting sky.
Of pinks and blues!
--- Unknown ---
I thought I knew what beautiful was
But now I've seen you,
Now I've seen you,
Oh!  Now I've seen you!
