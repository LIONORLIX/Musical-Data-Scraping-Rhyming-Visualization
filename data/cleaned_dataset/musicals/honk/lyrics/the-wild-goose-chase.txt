------ The Wild Goose Chase ------
--- Unknown ---
Greylag
We're off on a wild goose chase
We will be no stranger to danger the squadron will show no fear
--- Unknown ---
Dot
We're off and no matter where we roam
Although the mind boggles this gaggle in goggles
Is sure to find your home
--- Unknown ---
Greylag
Runway's clear
Prepare for takeoff dear
We must
Play our
Part
--- Unknown ---
Dot
Hark at him
I fear his cabin lights are rather dim
--- Unknown ---
Greylag
Chocks away
Our air display
Must start
--- Unknown ---
Greylag, dot
We're off on a wild goose chase
And our simple mission position the whereabouts of your farm
We're off and unless we're blown into kingdom come
We won't be back until we've found your mum
--- Unknown ---
Dot (spoken)
But we don't even know where his farm is,
Dear, how are we going to plan the route?
--- Unknown ---
Greylag (spoken)
Dont worry dear i'll navigate!
--- Unknown ---
Dot (spoken)
Thats what i was afraid of
--- Unknown ---
Greylag, dot, squadron
We're off on a wild goose chase
It's a thankless task but we ask
Who could do it as well as we
We're off, need to solve this problem's crux
For what could be grander
Than having a gander
For A-WOL missing ducks
--- Unknown ---
Cat (spoken)
Hello ducky! I thought i lost you!
--- Unknown ---
Greylag (spoken)
Stand back or i'll peck!
--- Unknown ---
Cat (spoken)
Ooh, be still my quaking legs, i'm going to be goosed!
--- Unknown ---
Ugly (spoken)
What are you doing here?
--- Unknown ---
Cat (spoken)
Your mother sent me to fetch you- special envoy
--- Unknown ---
Greylag (spoken)
Listen here, cat. I am in command around here,
And i have taken personal charge of the duckling's
Safe return to his mother
--- Unknown ---
Cat (spoken)
Well i wouldn't try flying at the moment,
Haven't you heard the guns?
--- Unknown ---
Greylag (spoken)
We will commence maneuvers as soon as the shooting party is over
--- Unknown ---
Cat (spoken)
Well, maybe i could be of assistance. I'll go over to the shoot,
And let you know when the're packing up for the day
--- Unknown ---
Greylag (spoken)
Very well, but no funny business,
I know several ways to skin your type
--- Unknown ---
Cat (spoken)
It's like taking candy from a baby
--- Unknown ---
Greylag, dot, squadron
We're off on a wild goose chase
--- Unknown ---
Dot
You may think it odd
That a squad
Such as ours
Can perform this role
--- Unknown ---
Greylag, dot, squadron
We're off,
And we'll prove that's not the case
--- Unknown ---
Greylag
Avioding the ack-ack
We'll search for this quack-quack
And then return to base
--- Unknown ---
Greylag (spoken)
We're about to face the most perilous mission to date.
I need hardly to tell you of the risks involved,
Or of the ultimate
Price we may have to pay. As we fly on to glory,
I want you to know how very proud i am of this squad.
Keep a stiff upper beak men, and remember out motto.
siempre victorium non patte de foi gras
--- Unknown ---
Dot (spoken)
Good afternoon ladies and gentelmen, my name is dot,
And i am your senior flight attendant,
And on behalf of captain greylag,
I would like to welcome you to this afternoon's flight
From a boggy marshland to some...far flung farm. We will be
Cruising at an altitude of several feet
And flying in a rather attractive v-formation.
In the unlikely event of an emergency landing,
We ask that you observe the safety procedures we've been through so many,
Many times before.
We hope that you have a pleasant journey,
And thank you for choosing goose air- the fluffy skies
--- Unknown ---
Greylag, dot, squadron
We're off to ensure this duckling is not so glum,
We won't be back until we've found your-
--- Unknown ---
Cat (spoken)
The coast is clear- they're putting away their guns!
--- Unknown ---
Greylag (spoken)
Are you sure?
--- Unknown ---
Cat (spoken)
On one of my lives
--- Unknown ---
Greylag (spoken)
Alright men, final check. Oh, and here's the cat's parachute
--- Unknown ---
Cat (spoken)
F-f-for me?
--- Unknown ---
Greylag(spoken)
You don't think i was going to leave you here with the duckling so you?
Oh no, puss, you're coming with us!
--- Unknown ---
Cat (spoken)
Oh cat litter!!!
--- Unknown ---
Greylag, dot, squadron
Our wings are spread
--- Unknown ---
Ugly
So don't delay
--- Unknown ---
Greylag, dot, squadron
Our excess bags are stowed away
It's time
To fly
--- Unknown ---
Greylag, dot, squadron (simultaneous w/ ugly)
We're off on a wild goose chase
With a happy ending impending
If we can locate his nest
--- Unknown ---
Ugly (simultaneous w/ greylag, dot, squadron)
They're off to try and find the farm
And when they find the farm they'll find my mum
And then she'll be there forever every day
--- Unknown ---
Greylag, dot, squadron
We're off cheerio, goodbye, toodlepip old chum,
We won't be back until (we won't be back until [wont be back])
We won't be back until we've found (found [found])
