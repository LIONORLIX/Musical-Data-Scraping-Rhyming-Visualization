------ Look At Him ------
--- DUCKLINGS ---
look at him!
--- IDA ---
now then, children,
let's not make a fuss
--- DUCKLINGS ---
look at him!
--- DRAKE ---
are you sure he's really one of us?
--- IDA ---
family likeness isn't strong,
still you won't poke fun.
all of you must get along--
he's a special son.
--- Unknown ---
(IDA, spoken:)
Come along, all of you now, follow me.
But stay close to me at all times or you may get trodden on...and beware of the cat!
--- DUCKLINGS ---
look at him--
legs are bandy
and the knees are knocked.
look at him
--- BILLY ---
dad was obviously egg-shell-shocked
--- DUCKLINGS ---
bet the neighbors scream and howl
when they see our brood.
he's the foulest waterfowl
--- UGLY ---
why are you so rude?
--- DOWNY (spoken) ---
Ooh, touchy!
--- MAUREEN ---
look at him!
come on, Ida, tell me what went wrong?
look at him!
did you leave him in the egg too long?
--- IDA ---
I admire you for your pluck
srictly entre nous
he may be no pin-up duck...
neither, dear, are you!
--- UGLY ---
look at you, look at me
what's it matter?
--- DOWNY (spoken) ---
isn't it obvious?
--- UGLY ---
why do I make you all laugh and scoff?
--- BEAKY (spoken) ---
have you seen your reflection?
--- UGLY ---
why don't we play with the fishes?
--- DUCKLINGS ---
because you'd scare them off!
--- DRAKE ---
look at him
you admit he is a bit extreme?
--- DUCKILNGS ---
now our parents will start quibbling
--- IDA ---
look at him
just a variation on a theme
--- DUCKLINGS ---
he's a truly ugly sibling
--- IDA ---
I don't want to see my son
left out on a limb
why is it that everyone has to jeer?
--- DRAKE ---
there's your answer, dear...
--- ALL ---
look at him!
--- HENRIETTA ---
peck, peck, peck, peck!
I hate to be picky
but the duck--peck, peck--
looks a little bit dicky!
look at him--sqwuak!--
did you ever see a pig with wings?
look at him--sqwuak!--don't genetics do the strangest things?
though the thought may not appeal
break the ties that bind
if you gave the cat a meal...
nobody would mind
--- TURKEY ---
look at him
he's an ugly one, there is no doubt
look at him
does he have his giblets inside-out?
what else would explain his looks
being quite so rough?
how on earth would gourmet cooks
know which end to stuff?!
--- ALL ---
look at him, look at us
see the difference
look at him, look at us
where's the match?
--- TURKEY & HENRIETTA ---
sometimes we find it is kinder
if some eggs never hatch
--- CAT ---
look at him!
still a duckling
but there's so much more...
look at him!
finest cat food that I ever saw
better still he won't be missed--
they think he's a flop
maybe they'll let me assist
giving him the chop!
--- TURKEY (spoken) ---
now in a moment you will be presented to Her Grace...she is looked up to by both men and animal.
--- IDA (spoken) ---
Now, don't turn your toes in, just bow your head politely and say Quack
--- Unknown ---
DUCKLINGS (individually)
quack! quack! quack! quack!
--- UGLY ---
Honk!
--- DUCKLINGS ---
look at him
now he's ruining our photograph
--- IDA ---
just imagine how he's feeling
--- GRACE ---
look at him
mother nature must have had a laugh
--- IDA ---
in a way he's quite appealing
--- DRAKE/TURKEY/MAUREEN/HENRIETTA ---
look at him
--- DUCKLINGS ---
look at him
na na na na na na na na na
--- GRACE ---
a relation one should sever
--- DRAKE/TURKEY/MAUREEN/HENRIETTA ---
a relation one should sever
look at him!
--- DUCKLINGS ---
look at him
na na na na na na na na na
--- ALL ---
he is gawky in whatever he does, oh
he really is an ugly oiseau
--- IDA ---
he's my son and I love him
do you see what you've done?
you're to blame
this duckyard would be so boring
if we all looked the same
--- DRAKE/TURKEY/MAUREEN/HENRIETTA ---
look at him
--- DUCKLINGS ---
look at him
--- DRAKE/TURKEY/MAUREEN/HENRIETTA ---
and be thankful that he's not your kid
--- DUCKLINGS ---
but we've got him as a brother
--- DRAKE/TURKEY/MAUREEN/HENRIETTA ---
look at him
--- DUCKILINGS ---
look at him
--- DRAKE/TURKEY/MAUREEN/HENRIETTA ---
bound to go the way the dodo did
--- DUCKLINGS ---
and he's worse than any other
--- DRAKE/TURKEY/MAUREEN/HENRIETTA ---
bodywork designed to shock
--- DUCKLINGS ---
la la la la la
--- DRAKE/TURKEY/MAUREEN/HENRIETTA ---
prospects pretty dim
--- DUCKLINGS ---
la la la la la
--- DRAKE/TURKEY/MAUREEN/HENRIETTA ---
he should form a solo flock
--- CAT ---
look at him little thing
his neck just made to wring
--- ALL ---
look at him,
look at me,
look at you,
you'll agree
anywhere you look will be less grim
than a glimpse of this wimp of wimps...
look at him!!!
