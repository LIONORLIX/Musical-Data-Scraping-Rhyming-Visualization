------ Warts And All ------
--- Bullfrog ---
You mark my words, feathers, one day ugly we'll be in
--- Unknown ---
If you just sit tight on your lilypad
Each silly fad will pass
Then those who sport this seasons look
Will fall flat on their ask your mother what its called
For fashion is a fickle thing
But just you wait and see
The day will come when we're in style
And then i guarantee
--- Unknown ---
Out there someones gonna love ya
Someones gonna love ya
Warts and all
Out there just around the corner
In amongst the fauna
Someones gonna fall for you
--- Unknown ---
Though im tyrannasaurus- rexy
Some will find me sexy
In my way
Though it may take some time to find em
When you do you'll have a ball
Cause out there somewhere someones gonna love ya
Warts and all
--- Ugly ---
Do you really believe that?
--- Bullfrog ---
Of course, if i didn't i might as well just jack it all in an donate my legs to gastronomic reasearch,
I'm telling you feathers you got to look on the sunnyside of the lilypad
--- Unknown ---
The ugliest of creatures
Have a few redeeming features
Some why not let your better point
Shine forth
--- Ugly ---
A mount that runs from east to west
Is bound to make you look depressed
Its better if the corners both point north
--- Bullfrog ---
Now that's the idea!
--- Unknown ---
So don't go into hidin'
Theres no need for disguise
Even some potatoes
Have got nice eyes
--- Unknown ---
I'm telling you feathers!
--- Unknown ---
Out there someones gonna love ya
Someones gonna love ya
--- Ugly ---
Warts and all
--- Bullfrog ---
Now you're croaking my language!
--- Ugly ---
Out there in a muddy puddle
Someone needs a cuddle
Though the chance is small
--- Bullfrog ---
Its true
Just think whenever you need boosting
One day you'll be roosting
With a mate
Though it may take some time to find em
When you do you'll have a ball
--- Both ---
Cause out there somewhere
Someones gonna love ya
Warts and all
--- Bullfrog ---

Somewhere out there
We don't know where
Someone will care

Warts and all
Somewhere out there
We cant say where
But someone is gonna fall for you

In my way
