------ Hold Your Head Up High ------
--- Ida ---
Hold your head up high
Like the most happy fella
While down below each thigh
Apropos a propeller
Must keep paddling like the clappers
You keep paddling with your flappers
While seeming to be dreaming and calm
--- Ugly ---
Like this?
--- Ida ---
That's the way
Bend your knees
No splashing please
--- Ugly ---
Sorry
--- Ida ---
And steady watch that eddy to your right
Danger sign
--- Ugly ---
Danger sign?
--- Ida ---
That's fishing line
--- Ugly ---
Fishing line?
--- Ida ---
Which strangles if it tangles you up tight
He's a natural in a class of his own
--- Ugly ---
This is wonderful, I am feeling full grown
--- Ida ---
Look at you
You have every reason to
--- Both ---
Hold your head up high
--- Ida ---
As if free from all troubles
Your back stays nice and dry
--- Ugly ---
But my bottom's in bubbles
--- Both ---
You keep paddling like the clappers
just keep paddling with your flappers
while seeming to be dreaming and calm
--- Ida ---
Just beneath the surface
You may struggle to get by
--- Ugly ---
But nothing can deter you
Both: If you hold your head up high
