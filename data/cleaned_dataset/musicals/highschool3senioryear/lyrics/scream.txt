------ Scream ------
--- Unknown ---
The day your door is closed
The echoes fill your soul
It won't say which way to go
Just trust your heart
--- Unknown ---
To find what you're here for
Open another door
But I'm not sure anymore
It's just so hard
--- Unknown ---
Voices in my head
Tell me they know best
Gotto keep me on the edge
They're pushin', pushin', they're pushin'
--- Unknown ---
I know they've got a plan
With the balls in my hands
This time it's man to man
I'm droppin', fightin' inside of (oh, that's upside down)
I'm spinnin' faster
What do I do now?
Without you
--- Unknown ---
I don't know where to go
What's the right team?
I want my own thing
So bad I'm gonna scream!
--- Unknown ---
I can't choose
So confused
What's it all mean?
I want my own dream
So bad I'm gonna scream!
--- Unknown ---
I'm kicking down the walls
I gotta make them fall
Just break through them all
I'm pushin', crushin', upon a freight
--- Unknown ---
To find myself
Me and no one else
Which way? I can't tell
I'm searchin', searchin', can't find a (no, man, I should turn)
I should to right or left is
It's like nothing works
Without you
--- Unknown ---
I don't know where to go
What's the right team?
I want my own thing
So bad I'm gonna scream!
--- Unknown ---
I can't choose
So confused
What's it all mean?
I want my own dream
So bad I'm gonna scream!
--- Unknown ---
Yeah
The clock's running down
Hear the crowd gettin' loud
I'm consumed by the sound
Is it her?
Is it love?
Can the music ever be enough?
Got to work it out
Got to work it out
You can do it
You can do it!
--- Unknown ---
I don't know where to go
What's the right team?
I want my own thing
So bad I'm gonna scream!
--- Unknown ---
I can't choose
So confused
What's it all mean?
I want my own dream
So bad I'm gonna scream!
--- Unknown ---
I don't know where to go
What's the right team?
I want my own thing
I want my own thing
--- Unknown ---
I can't choose
So confused
What's it all mean?
I want my own dream
So bad I'm gonna scream!
--- Unknown ---
Oh!
