------ Walk Away ------
--- Unknown ---
Oooh
--- Unknown ---
I guess I shoulda known better
To believe I'm a lucky change (lucky change), ooh
I lent my heart out forever
And finally learned each other's names (others names)
--- Unknown ---
I tell myself this time is different
No goodbyes, cause I can't bear to say it
I'll never survive the one that's coming
If I stay, oh no!
--- Unknown ---
Just walk away
Oh, and don't look back
Cause if my heart breaks, it's gonna hurt so bad
You know I'm strong, but I can't take this
Before it's too late (ooh), oh
Just walk away (walk, walk, walk away)
Ooh, just walk away (walk, walk, walk away)
eah, ya-eah
--- Unknown ---
I really wish I could blame you
But I know that it's no one's fault (yeah, no one's fault), no no, no no
Cinderella with no shoe
And the Prince is gonna know he's lost (know he's lost)
He says these mistakes are so familiar
Each goodbye is just the same old stuff
But this time I will not surrender
Cause I'm done (no, oh)
--- Unknown ---
Just walk away
Oh, and don't look back
Cause if my heart breaks, it's gonna hurt so bad
You know I'm strong, but I can't take this
Before it's too late
Oh, just walk away (walk, walk, walk away)
Oh, just walk away (walk, walk, walk away) oh
Just walk away
--- Unknown ---
I've got to let it go, oh
Start protecting my heart and soul
Cause I don't think I'll survive
A goodbye again, not again
--- Unknown ---
Just walk away
Oh, and don't look back
Cause if my heart breaks, it's gonna hurt so bad
You know I'm strong, but I can't take this
Before it's too late (before it's too late) oh
Just walk away (walk, walk, walk away)
Walk away, walk away, yeah (walk, walk, walk away)
Walk away, walk away, oh (walk, walk, walk away)
Walk away, walk away (walk, walk, walk away)
Walk away, walk away, oh
