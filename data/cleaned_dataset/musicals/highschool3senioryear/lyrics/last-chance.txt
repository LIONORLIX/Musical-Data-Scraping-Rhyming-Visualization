------ Last Chance ------
--- All ---
Because it's our last chance
to share the stage
Before we go our separate ways
We should spend these final days together
--- Unknown ---
It's our last chance for us to shine
and make some music one more time
--- Unknown ---
So come on,
come on, come on
come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on
come on, come on, come on
Let's dance!
Let's dance!
--- Unknown ---
Because this is our last chance
it's our last chance!
