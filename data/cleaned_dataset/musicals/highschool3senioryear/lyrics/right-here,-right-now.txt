------ Right Here, Right Now ------
--- Troy ---
Can you imagine, what would happen
if we could have any dream.
I'd wish this moment, was ours to own it
and that it would never leave.
Then I would thank that star,
that made our wish come true (come true)
Oh, yeah
Cause he knows that where you are, is where I should be too.
Right Here, Right Now
I?m looking at you, and my heart loves the view
Cause you mean everything
Right Here, I promise you somehow
That tomorrow can wait, some other day to be (to be)
But right now there's you and me.
--- Gabriella ---
It feels like forever, what could be better?
We've already proved it was.
That two thousand words, twenty three hours, have blended the universe.
Its gonna be, everything (everything)
in our whole world changed
and do know that when we are, (when we are)
our memory's the same
oh no,oh no
--- Troy & Gabriella ---
Right Here, Right Now (right now)
Im looking at you,and my heart loves the view
Cause you mean everything (everything)
Right Here, I promise you somehow (somehow were gonna)
That tomorrow can wait, some other day to be (to be)
But right now there's you and me.
Oh we know its coming (coming)
Oh its coming fast
Its always you and me, oh yeah
So lets make this second last
make it last.
