------ A Night To Remember ------
--- Unknown ---
Guess now it's official
Can't back out, can't back out,
No!
--- Unknown ---
Gettin ready (gettin ready, oh)
For the night of nights (uh-huh)
The night of nights (all right)
--- Unknown ---
Don't panic.
Panic!
--- Unknown ---
Now do we have to dress up for the Prom?
Dude, I don't think we have the choice.
--- Unknown ---
Yeah it's the night of all nights
Got to look just right
Dressing to impress the boys
--- Unknown ---
Do I want classic or vintage or plaid?
Where's the mirror?
I think this tux is too baggy
Too tight, it makes me look weird
--- Unknown ---
Should I go movie star, glamorous, sassy or sweet?
Don't know, but no one better wear the same dress as me!
--- Unknown ---
It's the night of our nightmares (it's the night of our dreams)
It's too late to back out of this (hey!)
Makeovers, massages
Don't know what a corsage is
Been waiting all our lives for this
--- Unknown ---
It's gonna be a night (can't wait)
To remember (aw man)
Come on now!
Big fun (all right)
--- Unknown ---
It's gonna be the night (I guess)
To last forever (lucky us)
--- Unknown ---
We'll never ever ever forget!
--- Unknown ---
Gettin' ready (get ready)
Gettin', gettin' ready, ready (get ready)
Gettin' ready,
Gettin', gettin' ready, oh!
--- Unknown ---
Hey you been in there an hour, man!
So what should I do with my hair?
Where's my shaver? (ooh I love it!)
I look like a waiter! (should I fluff it?)
It's gettin' later already should be there
--- Unknown ---
Her mother opens the door
I'm shaking inside
He's here! It's time! The hour's arrived!
Don't know why her father's staring me down
Where's my purse? Lip gloss? Now I'm really freaking out!
--- Unknown ---
Then something changes my world
The most beautiful girl right in front of my eyes
--- Unknown ---
It's gonna be a night (oh yeah)
To remember (that's for sure!)
Come on now!
Big fun (all right!)
--- Unknown ---
It's gonna be the night (yeah tonight)
To last forever (forevermore)
We'll never ever forget!
--- Unknown ---
Who's that girl?
She's so fine
Who's that guy?
I don't recognize, no
Who's that girl?
She looks so good, yeah
Guess you never really noticed but you probably should!
Big fun!
--- Unknown ---
On the night of nights, (all right)
The night of nights, tonight
Let's dance!
On the night of nights, you know we're gonna do it right
--- Unknown ---
It's gonna be a night
To remember
It's gonna be the night
To last forever
--- Unknown ---
It's gonna be our night (yeah)
To remember
It's gonna be the night
To last forever (forever)
--- Unknown ---
It's gonna be our night (you know it)
To remember (for all time)
Come on now
Big fun (to remember)
--- Unknown ---
It's gonna be the night (to love it)
To last forever (the rest of our lives)
We'll never ever ever forget!
--- Unknown ---
It's gonna be our night (oh yeah)
All together (say it loud!)
Come on now, everyone (that's right)
--- Unknown ---
It's gonna be a night (yeah tonight)
To remember (hear the crowd)
--- Unknown ---
And never ever ever never ever ever never ever never ever ever forget!
