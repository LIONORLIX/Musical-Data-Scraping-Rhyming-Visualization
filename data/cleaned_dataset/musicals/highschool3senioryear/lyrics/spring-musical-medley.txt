It's our last chance to share the stage
Before we go our separate ways
High school wasn't meant to last forever
It's our last chance for us to shine
To bring you music one more time
So come on, come on, come on (come on, come on, come on)
Come on, come on, come on,
--- Unknown ---
W-I-L-D Wildcats!
You know! Come on!
W-I-L-D Wildcats!
Come on, come on!
--- Unknown ---
East High Boys, let's make some noise! (oh yeah)
W-I-L-D Wildcats!
Now's the time!
--- Unknown ---
(Wildcats!) This is the last time to get it right (Go Wildcats!)
This is the last chance to make it our night (Wildcats!)
We gotta show what we're all about (Go Wildcats!)
Work together!
This is our last chance to make our mark
History will know who we are
This is the last chance to make it count
It's now or never, yeah
--- Unknown ---
I want it (all!) I want it, want it, want it
The fame and the fortune and more
I want it all! I want it, want it, want it
I gotta have my star on the door!
--- Unknown ---
I want the world, nothing less
All the glam, and the press
Only giving me the best reviews

I want it all, I want it all,
I want it all, I want it all
I want it all

Kick it girls!

We want it (we want it) all!
Rugband! Thank you, East High! You're amazing! Good night!
--- Unknown ---
ooh, yeah, yeah

I got a lot of things
I have to do
All these distractions
Our future's coming soon
--- Unknown ---
We're being pulled
A hundred different directions
But whatever happens
I know I've got you
--- Unknown ---
You're on my mind, you're in my heart
It doesn't matter where we are
We'll be all right
Even if we're miles apart
Even if we're miles apart
Even if we're miles and miles and miles apart
--- Unknown ---
All I wanna do
Is be with you, be with you
There's nothing we can't do (ew)
Just wanna be with you, only you
--- Unknown ---
No matter where life takes us
Nothing can take us apart (achoo!)
I just wanna be with (ew) you
--- Unknown ---
You know how life can be
It changes overnight
It's sunny then raining
But it's all right
--- Unknown ---
A friend like you
Always makes it easy
I know that you get me
Every time
--- Unknown ---
Through every up through every down
You know I'll always be around
Through anything you can count on me
--- Unknown ---
All I wanna do
Is be with you, be with you
There's nothing we can't do
Just wanna be with you, only you
--- Unknown ---
No matter where life takes us
Nothing can break us apart (you know it's true)
I just wanna be with you, you
I just wanna be with you
--- Unknown ---
The sun will always shine
That's how you make me feel
We're gonna be all right
Cause what we have is real
We will always be together
--- Unknown ---
All I wanna do
Is be with you, be with you
There's nothing we can't do
Just wanna be with you, only you
--- Unknown ---
No matter where life takes us
Nothing can break us apart (you know it's true)

All that I wanna do
Just be with you

On the night of nights, the night of nights, tonight
Let's dance!

And never ever ever never ever ever never ever never ever ever forget!
