------ Just Wanna Be With You ------
--- Unknown ---
I got a lot of things
I have to do..
All these distractions
Our futures coming soon
We're Being pulled a hundred different directions
But whatever happens I know I've got you
--- Unknown ---
Your on my mind your in my heart
It doesn't matter where we are
It'll be alright
Even if we're miles apart
--- Unknown ---
All I wanna do, Is be with you be with you
There's nothing we can do Just wanna be with you
Only you
No matter where life takes us nothing can break us apart..
You know its true
I just wanna be with you
--- Unknown ---
(Be with you)
--- Unknown ---
You know how life can be
It changes over night
Its sunny but raining, but its alright
A friend like you..
Always makes it easy
I know that your kidding me every time.
--- Unknown ---
Through every up through every down
You know I'll always be around
Through everything you can count on me..
--- Unknown ---
All I wanna do, Is be with you be with you
There's nothing we can do Just wanna be with you
Only you
No matter where life takes us nothing can break us apart..
You know its true
I just wanna be with you
