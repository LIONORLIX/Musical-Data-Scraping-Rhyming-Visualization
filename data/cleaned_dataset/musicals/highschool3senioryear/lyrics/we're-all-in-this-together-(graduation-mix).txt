Together, together, together everyone

Here and now it's time for celebration
We finally figured it out (yeah yeah)
That all our dreams have no limitations
That's what it's all about

Everyone is special in their own way
We make each other strong (make each other strong)
We're not the same
We're different in a good way
Together's where we belong
--- Unknown ---
We're all in this together
Once we know
That we are
We're all stars
And we see that
We're all in this together
And it shows
When we stand
Hand in hand
Make our dreams come true.. (Make our dreams come true..)
