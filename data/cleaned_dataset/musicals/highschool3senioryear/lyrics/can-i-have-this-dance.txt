------ Can I Have This Dance ------
--- Unknown ---
Take my hand
Take a breath
Pull me close
And take one step
Keep your eyes
Locked on mine
And let the music be your guide.
--- Unknown ---
Won't you promise me (Now won't you promise me)
That you'll never forget (We'll keep dancing)
To keep dancing
Wherever we go next
--- Unknown ---
It's like catching lightning
The chances of finding someone
Like you
It's one in a million
The chances of feeling the way
We do
--- Unknown ---
And with every step together
We just keep on getting better
--- Unknown ---
So can I have this dance? (Can I have this dance?)
Can I have this dance?
--- Unknown ---
Take my hand
I'll take the lead
And every turn
Will be safe with me
--- Unknown ---
To be afraid
Afraid to fall
You know I'll catch you
Through it all
--- Unknown ---
And you can't keep (even a thousand miles)
Us apart (can keep us apart)
Cause my heart (cause my heart)
Is wherever you are
--- Unknown ---
It's like catching lightning
The chances of finding someone
Like you
It's one in a million
The chances of feeling the way
We do
--- Unknown ---
And with every step together
We just keep on getting better
--- Unknown ---
So can I have this dance? (Can I have this dance)
Can I have this dance?
--- Unknown ---
Oh,
No mountain's too high enough
Oceans too wide
Cause together or not
Our dance won't stop
--- Unknown ---
Let it rain, let it pour
What we have is worth fighting for
You know I believe
That we were meant to be,
Yeah,
--- Unknown ---
It's like catching lightning
The chances of finding someone
Like you (Like you)
It's one in a million
The chances of feeling the way
We (we do) do
--- Unknown ---
And with every step together
We just keep on getting better
--- Unknown ---
So can I have this dance? (Can I have this dance?)
Can I have this dance?
--- Unknown ---
Can I have this dance?
Can I have this dance?
