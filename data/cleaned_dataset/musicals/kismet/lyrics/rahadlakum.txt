------ Rahadlakum ------
--- Unknown ---
On days when my lord feeleth restless
And bored with his sword and his plume
His handmaiden hath what he needeth
And what doth he need?
--- Unknown ---
Rahadlakume!
--- Unknown ---
On nights when my lord looketh listless
And black is the hue of his gloom
His handmaiden hath what he lacketh
And what doth he lack?
--- Unknown ---
Rahadlakume!
--- Unknown ---
Tis sweet with the meat of a lichee nut
Combined with a kumquat rind
The kind of confection to drive a man out of his Mesopotamian mind
--- Unknown ---
And lo, if my lord feeleth faithless
And wanders by night from his room
His handmaiden fanneth her fires
And out of the pan rises a tantalizing perfume
--- Unknown ---
He scenteth the scent
He turneth his face
His previous place, in her embrace
He does resume
--- Unknown ---
And love is in bloom
The while they consume
