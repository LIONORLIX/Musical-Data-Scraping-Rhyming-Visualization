------ Stranger In Paradise ------
--- She ---
Oh why do the leaves
Of the Mulberry tree
Whisper differently now
And why is the nightingale singing
At noon on the Mulberry bow
For some most mysterious reason
This isn't the garden I know
No it's paradise now
That was only a garden
A moment ago
--- He ---
Take my hand
I'm a stranger in paradise
All lost in a wonderland
A stranger in paradise
If I stand starry-eyed
That's a danger in paradise
For mortals who stand beside
An angel like you
--- Unknown ---
I saw your face
And I ascended
Out of the commonplace
Into the rare
Somewhere in space
I hang suspended
Until I know
There's a chance that you care
--- Unknown ---
Won't you answer the fervent prayer
Of a stranger in paradise
Don't send me in dark despair
From all that I hunger for
But open your angel's arms
To the stranger in paradise
And tell him
That he need be
A stranger no more
--- She ---
I saw your face
And I ascended
Out of the commonplace
Into the rare
--- Both ---
Somewhere in space
I hang suspended
--- She ---
Until I know
--- He ---
Till the moment I know
--- She ---
There's a chance that you care
--- He ---
There's a chance that you care
--- She ---
Won't you answer the fervent prayer
Of a stranger in paradise
--- He ---
Don't send me in dark despair
From all that I hunger for
--- Both ---
But open your angel's arms
To the stranger in paradise
And tell me that I may be
