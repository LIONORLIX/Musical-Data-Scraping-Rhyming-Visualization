------ Fate ------
--- Unknown ---
I sat down, feeling desolated, bowed my head and crossed my knees--Is fortune really predicated upon such tiny turns as these? Then Fate's a thing without a head. A puzzle never understood, and man proceeds where he is led, unguaranteed of bad or good.

Fate!
Fate can be a trap in our path,
The bitter cup of your tears,
Your wine of wrath!
--- Unknown ---
Fate can be shade of the desert blaze,
Sudden food in a famine found,
The sound of praise!
Incomprehensible and strange,
Fate can play a trick with the twine
To weave the evil and good
In one design!
And so, my Destiny,
I look at you and cannot see
Is it good, is it ill?
Am I blessed, am I cursed?
Is it honey on my tongue or brine?
