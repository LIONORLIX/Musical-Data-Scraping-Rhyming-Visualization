------ Was I Wazir? ------
--- Unknown ---
When we caught the seven hundred men
And hung them in their prison pen,
Who said, Suspend them by their fuzz?
Was I Wazir? I was!
--- Unknown ---
When the keeper of the royal zoo
Was short a cockatoo or two,
Who sealed him in a pot of glue?
Was I Wazir? I was!
--- Unknown ---
(Was he Wazir? He was!
He has a way of learning what he wants to know,
Delicate, but to the point!)
--- Unknown ---
They always seem to remember
When I begin to dismember them
Arm by arm and ear by ear and joint by joint!
--- Unknown ---
When the court musician lost his grasp
And let his lute begin to rasp,
Who had him bitten by an asp?
Was I Wazir?
Was I Wazir?
I was!
--- Unknown ---
The time we caught the man who said I wasn't nice
(Joy oh joy,
That was a time!)
I confiscated his mother
And then did something or other
Involving her dissolving
In a vat of lime!
--- Unknown ---
When at last, in manner neat and deft,
I've hacked and hatcheted and cleft,
Until no-one but me is left,
I want it clear-
I WAS Wazir!
--- Unknown ---
(And IS Wazir
In every single charming and disarming
Thing he does!)
Was I Wazir?
