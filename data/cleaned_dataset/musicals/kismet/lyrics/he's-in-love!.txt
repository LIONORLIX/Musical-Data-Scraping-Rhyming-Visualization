------ He's In Love! ------
--- Unknown ---
See him smiling,
Hear him humming,
He's in love!
Joyful, jaunty,
Dreaming dazzled
He's in love!
Stars have invaded his eyes.
Silver bells in his voice
Sing a hymn to the her he dreams of!
Watch him wooing,
Purring, cooing,
He's a dove!
Sighing, doting,
Flying, floating,
High a bove!
Though you're suspecting
It's April affecting him so,
No.
Can't be, can't be,
Not him, not he,
He's in love,
and it's really love,
