------ And This Is My Beloved ------
--- Unknown ---
Dawn's promising skies
Petals on a pool drifting
Imagine these in one pair of eyes
And this is my beloved
--- Unknown ---
Strange spice from the south
Honey through the comb sifting
Imagine these in one eager mouth
And this is my beloved
--- Unknown ---
And when s/he speaks and when s/he talks to me
Music! Mystery!
And when s/he moves And when s/he walks with me
Paradise comes suddenly near
--- Unknown ---
All that can stir All that can stun
All that's for the heart's lifting
Imagine these in one perfect one
--- Unknown ---
And this is my beloved
