------ Love Was A Song ------
--- TAYLOR ---
Love was a song once, tender and warm, like the breath of a cool summer morning.
And life was a dance once, graceful and sweet, like a tumbling leaf, a tumbling leaf.
--- Unknown ---
Then fate like the wind swept it away, and left me with nothing to sing or to play.
Is it all by design, or simply by chance?
Love was a song once and life was a dance...Faith?
--- Unknown ---
Love was a song, like mist in the spring.
My fingers were young, and could dance on these strings.
And life was a dance, an endless ballet, suspended in time and then swept away.
--- Unknown ---
Fate, like the wind, wild, untamed, left me with nothing but shame!

Is it all by design, or simply by chance?
Love was a song once and life was a dance.
