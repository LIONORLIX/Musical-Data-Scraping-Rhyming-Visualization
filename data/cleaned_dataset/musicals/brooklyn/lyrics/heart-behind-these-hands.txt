------ Heart Behind These Hands ------
--- Streetsinger ---
Ooohhh....yea...yea...yea...
There's a heart behind these hands
There's a soul beneath these clothes
There's a story behind these empty eyes
That no one wants to know
So if you have the time to listen
Then you just might understand
That your very life
Lies in the very hands of fate
Like the heart behind these hands
Like the heart behind these hands
--- Unknown ---
I once had me a fortuneteller tell me about my life
--- Raven ---
She said if no one's ever loved you child
Then everyone pays the price
--- Brooklyn ---
She said love is all we live for
--- Faith ---
It's gods one and only plan!!
--- Taylor ---
But even god may still abandon you
Like the heart behind these hands
--- Streetsinger ---
No no brother he's the one that's gonna pull you through
His love is fdo command!! yea!!
--- Company ---
There's a heart behind these hands
There's a sould beneath these clothes
--- Streetsinger ---
There's a story behind these empty eyes
That no one wants to know
--- Paradice ---
And do if the spirit moves you
--- Taylor ---
Give only what you can
--- Brooklyn ---
And i'll sing my song
Good and strong
I'm gonna sing it
--- Streetsinger ---
Go ahead and sing it!!
--- Paradice ---
I'm gonna sing it! sing it!! sing it!!
--- Streetsinger ---
Sing your heart!!
--- Taylor ---

--- Faith ---
Hoowahooo!!

From the heart behind these hands!!
