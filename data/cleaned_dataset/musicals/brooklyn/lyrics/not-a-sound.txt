------ Not A Sound ------
--- Brooklyn ---
Mommy!
--- Company ---
Ah.......
--- Faith ---
A beautiful little girl
--- Paradice ---
Born of music, made of dreams
--- Streetsinger ---
Her world, just five years old
--- Faith ---
Unraveling
--- Taylor ---
And as the snow falls down
--- Paradice ---
On the cold, hard, ground
--- Taylor ---
There's not a word, not a whisper, not a sound.
--- Company ---
And as the snow falls down on the cold hard ground
--- Brooklyn ---
There's not a word, not a whisper, not a sound
--- Streetsinger ---
Motherless and fatherless, little Brooklyn was sent off to an orphanage,
The Sisters of Charity
--- Paradice ---
Guess who's the sister
--- Streetsinger ---
Then two years to the day her mother died,
seven year old Brooklyn walked into the orphanage chapel,
and though her hands had never touched the church organ before, she began to play.
She began to sing the Unfinished Lullabye
--- Brooklyn ---
La la la la, la la, la la la la, let our fate write words to this!
