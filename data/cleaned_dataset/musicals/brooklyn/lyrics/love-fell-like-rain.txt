She came to America looking for the lyric to her life.
And so tonight, Madison Square Garden is proud to bring to you the
olng awaited, much anticipated union of father and daguther.
Performing tonight for the very first time on this stage,
the greatest stage on earth,
I give you Paris' amazing grace, Brooklyn.

She waited tables
In a small cafe
In paris, 1969

He was a singer
From Brooklyn, USA
I hear it was a special time
--- Unknown ---
Love fell like rain
From the warm Paris sky
The song he sang
As he kissed her goodbye
--- Unknown ---
La, la, la, la
La, la
La, la, la, la...
--- Unknown ---
Ladies and gentlemen,
My father!!
--- PARADICE ---
Ooo, do I smell a forfeit?
Isn't this rich, the phantom daddy is M.I.A.
