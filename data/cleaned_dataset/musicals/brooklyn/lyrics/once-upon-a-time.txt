------ Once Upon A Time ------
--- Brooklyn ---
Has anyone ever read you a fairytale
And taken you to places magical
Where homes are made of gingerbread and skies are always blue
Where pumpkins turn to coaches and wishes all come true
--- Unknown ---
Has anyone ever sung you a lullaby?
You can fly above the rain clouds
Close your eyes
Let the melody carry you
Leave all your fears behind
You can float across a rainbow sky to once upon a time
--- Unknown ---
I believed in miracles (once upon a time)
I believed love would conquer all (once upon a time)
I believed anything was possible
And i believed again the moment when
I saw you here tonight
Now once upon a time has never felt more right
(Once upon a time) I believed in miracles
(Once upon a time) I believed that love would conquer all
I believed anything was possible
Once upon a time (we believed in miracles)
Once upon a time (we believed that love would conquer all)
Oh yes I believed that anything was possible
And I believed again the moment when
I saw you here tonight
Now once upon a time
Has never felt more right
