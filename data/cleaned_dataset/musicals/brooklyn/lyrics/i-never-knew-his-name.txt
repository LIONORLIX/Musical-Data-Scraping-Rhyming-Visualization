------ I Never Knew His Name ------
--- Brooklyn ---
Taylor Collins. I never knew his name,
But I imagined what he looked like, imagined how he'd smile.
A hug tight, a kiss goodnight, the way a father holds his child.
--- Unknown ---
I never knew his name.
But I imagined him a hero, a bright and shining knight.
And daddy's eyes would stop my cries and make everything alright.
--- Unknown ---
Oh, daddy's eyes would stop my cries, and make everything alright.
