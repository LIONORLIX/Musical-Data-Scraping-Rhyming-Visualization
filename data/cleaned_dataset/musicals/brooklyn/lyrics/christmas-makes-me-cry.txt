Brooklyn: (spoken)
Mommy, look! It's snowing!
--- Unknown ---
Faith: (sung)
People out there, giving. Celebration in the air.
Midnight bells are ringing, it's snowing everywhere.
--- Unknown ---
Brooklyn: (spoken)
Do you think it's snowing where daddy is?
--- Unknown ---
Faith: (sung)
Everyone's with someone, but for you and I, I couldn't wait for Christmas.
Now Christmas makes me cry.

Streetsinger: (spoken)
But far from Paris, in the land of the free and the home of the brave, another voice cries out
--- Unknown ---
Taylor: (sung)
Santa Claus is just a man wearing funny clothes.
Rudolph's just a song somebody has composed.
People are caroling, but I won't even try.
I used to sing at Christmas, now Christmas makes me cry.
Cause everyone's with someone who they love.
--- Faith ---
Everyone's with someone who they love.
--- Taylor and Faith ---
Everyone's with someone, but for you and I. I used to laugh at Christmas.

Taylor: Now Christmas makes me cry.

Madame and monsieur,
we are proud to present The Parisian Butterfly in her Tour de France,
The Unfinished Lullabye
--- Unknown ---
Taylor: (sung) Oh.....
--- Streetsinger ---
The only prop on stage, a hangless noose.
Placing the corse rope around her neck, she would ascend to unknown heights.
Suddenly she would drop from the rafters, swaying in dance at the end of the noose,
then floating to the stage like a summer butterfly.
Audiences would cheer, Bravo, Magnific!
--- Company ---
Bravo! Magnific!
--- Streetsinger ---
But all that love and adulation could not fill the hole in Faith's young soul,
a soul left empty by Taylor Collins.
--- Unknown ---
Taylor: (sung)
I used to laugh at Christmas, now Christmas makes me cry.
--- Unknown ---
Streetsinger: (spoken)
So, on a cold, snowy Christmas night, Faith, The Parisian Butterfly, ended her dance...
--- Brooklyn ---
Mommy?
--- Streetsinger ---
In death
