------ The Cigarette ------
--- NOAH ---
In our basement, where she?ll let
me light her daily cigarette.
--- CAROLINE ---
Light me up.
Don?t suck in!
Shouldn?t let you do that. Boy
when you grow up don?t smoke these things.
--- NOAH ---
Blow me smoke rings, smoke rings, smoke rings!
--- CAROLINE ---
Not today, I got to work.
--- NOAH ---
Caroline never tells me so but
I know daddy musn?t know.
A secret her and me can share:
Our daily cigarette?
--- CAROLINE ---
Now muse yourself,
I got no use for you.
This basement too darn hot for two.
--- THE WASHING MACHINE ---
Hum hum hum hum.
Smoke you daily cigarette.
--- CAROLINE ---
Only ever smoke but one.
