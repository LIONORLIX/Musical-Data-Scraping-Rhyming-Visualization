------ Santa Comin' Caroline ------
--- RADIO ---
Santa comin? Caroline!
Hark the Herald Joy Divine!
Jingle bells driftin through the pine!
Way down South it don?t snow
so you know
it?s a Sign!
--- Unknown ---
Loose change in the laundry
ring like Santa?s sleigh!
Should you leave ?em in the bleach cup?
Should you take them jinglin coins away?
--- Unknown ---
Season?s greetings Caroline!
Take the change! Why you disincline?
Does it taste like a bitter wine?
Mistletoe hangin low?
Go on,
bend your spine!
--- Unknown ---
Ain?t right to take his pennies.
They ain?t Santa?s sleigh.
Yeah but Christmas is expensive
You got gifts to buy and bills to pay.
--- Unknown ---
So Noel, baby, auld lang syne!
You been good, baby, toe-d the line.
Now go on, berry?s on the vine!
Jing-a-ling,
money bring
caroling?
