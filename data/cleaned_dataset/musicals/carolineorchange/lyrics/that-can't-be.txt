------ That Can't Be ------
--- CAROLINE & DOTTY ---
That can?t be.
--- BUS ---
Some man kill him,
Dead in Dallas.
--- ROSE ---
Noah darling look
I found change
in your pants pockets again.
--- THE BUS ---
News come slow here,
change come slow,
light gone out now, darkness come
Step on board;
time for departing?
--- ROSE ---
Noah please come here?
--- BUS ---
Into the nighttime,
toward what lies ahead.
--- ROSE ---
I need to speak to you!
