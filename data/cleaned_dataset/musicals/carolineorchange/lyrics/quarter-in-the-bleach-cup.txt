------ Quarter In The Bleach Cup ------
--- NOAH ---
Caroline took my money home!
My money home in her pocket book!
I leave a quarter to see what will happen.
--- CAROLINE ---
Quarter in the bleach cup, take it home.
--- NOAH ---
I leave two more quarters to see what she?ll do.
--- CAROLINE ---
Quarters in the bleach cup, take them home.
--- NOAH ---
Then I left a dollar bill
in my pocket
by mistake.
--- CAROLINE ---
He left a dollar in his pocket.
A dollar bill.
--- CAROLINE ---
Left this dollar
in your pocket!
Mind your money!
Lucky for you I didn?t take it.
--- NOAH ---
Can I light your cigarette?
--- CAROLINE ---
No you can?t! Now go on get!
You ain?t lighting no more cigarettes
never again no more. And if I catch you
playing with matches, I tell your mamma!
--- NOAH ---
My mama?s dead!
--- CAROLINE ---
You hear what I said?!
Spend your money on them funny books
and don?t try out your dirty looks!
Take your dollar, get upstairs!
Out my basement!
--- NOAH ---
I don?t want a cigarette! Who cares!
I leave another quarter.
--- CAROLINE ---
I leave it in the bleach cup.
--- NOAH ---
I leave another quarter.
--- CAROLINE ---
Two quarters in the bleach cup,
I leave ?em be.
--- NOAH ---
I leave another quarter.
Seventy-five cents?
--- CAROLINE ---
And I am mean and I am tough
but thirty dollars ain?t enough.
Thirty dollars and
seventy-five cents?
