------ The Dryer ------
--- THE DRYER ---
And the pit of your abasement
looks a bit like this old basement:
Time has come,
time has come,
time has come,
turn on the dryer!
Roasty, toasty, lectric fire!
Making my groans, making my moans,
shivering rumbling basemental tones,
cooking the meat
right off your bones!
Laundry mine now!
You know the story:
let?s make this basement
a purgatory.
Time has come
time has come
time has come to suffer heat!
