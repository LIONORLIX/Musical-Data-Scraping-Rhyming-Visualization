------ Mr. Stopnick And Emmie ------
--- MR. STOPNICK ---
Yes I know it worked just dandy
for that Indian Mister Ghandi
but with respect for Martin Luther King?
--- EMMIE ---
I think it?s a negro thing,
a southern thing,
a Christian thing;
mister, you don?t understand
how Dr. King has got things planned.
--- MR. STOPNICK ---
Oh Jews can be nonviolent too.
There?s nothing meeker than a Jew!
Listen girlie, we have learned:
nonviolence will get you burned.
--- EMMIE ---
No I?m sorry that ain?t so.
Listen to the radio.
What we?re trying?s already working!
Segregation?s already dying!
--- MR. STOPNICK ---
I been on the earth a while?
--- ROSE ---
Papa, this is Emmie
Emmie this is Mr. Stopnick, he--
--- MR. STOPNICK ---
?your optimism makes me smile.
Good for you you?re optimistic!
But I think it ain?t realistic.
--- EMMIE ---
I?d like to know how you come to feel
you know so much about what is real,
sitting safe and high and pretty,
way up north in New York City?
I?d like to know!
--- CAROLINE ---
Emmie!
--- EMMIE ---
Mama?
--- CAROLINE ---
I said quit!
--- EMMIE ---
He the one that started it!
--- ROSE ---
You know I was reading in the paper just the other day?
--- EMMIE ---
I?d like to know how
some guy just off a plane
marchin in to explain,
guess you seen it all plain
from the air?
It our
affair
Now our resistance
start to make a difference
here come your ?assistance.?

MR. STOPNICK (with Emmie)
Is that so?
Why?s it so impossible to know,
white or Jew or negro
if the boss?s boot?s in your face
what do you do? Shed a tear?
Keep lying there?
A face knows it?s no footrest
regardless of religion or race!
--- CAROLINE ---
Child you hear me?! Hush your mouth!
March that tray back to the kitchen!
--- MR. STOPNICK ---
Lady, please, since I come south,
she?s my first real conversation.
Let her stay!
--- CAROLINE ---
It?s past her bed.
--- ROSE ---
It?s good that she?s high-spirited!
--- CAROLINE ---
Yes?m. Thank you. We?ll start cleaning
in the kitchen, then go home.
