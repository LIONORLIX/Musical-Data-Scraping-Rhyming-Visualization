------ Stuart And Noah ------
--- ROSE ---
Please, Caroline, keep the change.
--- STUART ---
Noah, you?re nine years old.
--- NOAH ---
No I?m not I?m eight.
--- STUART ---
Eight? Only eight?
But you?re in fourth grade now.
--- NOAH ---
No, I?m in third.
--- STUART ---
Really, you?re sure?
Isn?t that weird.
It?s like a whole year just?
I don?t know, just disappeared.
I have to get back to the clarinet.
practice the cello.
--- NOAH ---
I gave up the cello, dad.
--- STUART ---
Oh right. You did.
I remember. You?re a funny kid.
Your mother loved the cello.
--- NOAH ---
Can I go?
--- STUART ---
It?s time that you should demonstrate
more responsibility.
Help Rose with the groceries,
that kind of thing.
In return I?m giving you
a dollar fifty every week
allowance. You can use it as you like but I?
--- NOAH ---
Buy buy
buy buy buy!
--- STUART ---
?I hope you?ll save it
till you?re older
buy yourself
a chemistry set.
--- NOAH ---
Bubblegum, cigarettes
sea monkeys,
comic books,
Barbie Doll dresses on the sly!
Buy buy
buy buy buy!
--- STUART ---
That?s what I wanted back when I
was a boy,
a great big shiny chemistry set.
--- CAROLINE ---
There?s almost a dollar
some weeks in the bleach cup.
My kids could go down to the dime store and get
the shiny junk they make to catch a kid?s eye.
And what they sees and what they wants
they could buy.
Stuff I can?t buy em now,
always in the lurch.
Some weeks I could even tithe at Church.
--- Unknown ---
STUART (with CAROLINE)
A great big shiny chemistry set!
With test tubes, a spirit lamp,
powders, and flame.
Do you want a chemistry set?
--- NOAH ---
No.
--- STUART ---
Oh. Well, that?s a shame.
It?s your money Noah, so please
keep in mind?
--- ROSE ---
Caroline keeps what Caroline finds.
--- NOAH ---
That night I leave a dime and a nickel
in my pants pocket
to see what will happen;
Caroline finds them.
--- CAROLINE ---
They go in the bleach cup.
--- NOAH ---
They sit there all week,
fifteen cents, fifteen cents,
five jawbreakers,
a big bag of red hots,
a Daredevil comic book,
fifteen cents!
--- Unknown ---
CAROLINE (with Noah)
They sit there all week.
Fifteen cents, fifteen cents,
a bag of sugary things
stain the mouth orange
stain the teeth green
that upset the stomach?
A grown woman got no business
taking pennies from a baby.
