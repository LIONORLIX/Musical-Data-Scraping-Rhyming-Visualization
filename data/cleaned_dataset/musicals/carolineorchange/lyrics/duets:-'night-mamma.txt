------ Duets: 'Night Mamma ------
--- EMMIE ---
Night mama!
Night God!
Night Radio!
Night cheap beautiful music!
Night frogs in autumn,
night unseasonable frogs!
Night barking dogs
and mice-hunting cats
and cicadas in the pecan trees
and everything that dies
when winter comes!
Night lightning bugs!
Good night!
--- NOAH ---
President Caroline!
President Caroline Thibodeaux!
--- CAROLINE ---
Right here, right here.
--- NOAH ---
What are you gonna do now
that President Kennedy?s dead?
Now you?re the only President
in the United States!
