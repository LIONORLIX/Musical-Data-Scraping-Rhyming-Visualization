------ Duets: Gonna Pass Me A Law ------
--- CAROLINE ---
Gonna pass me a law
that night last longer.
Gonna pass me a law
Larry come home from Vietnam
wherever that is
gonna pass me a law
no woman can be my age
and not know enough
to read a map.
Gonna pass me a law
that my heathen daughter
don?t never get hurt
nor learn how to mind me,
nor learn how to mind
nobody cept herself.
Gonna pass me a law
say Nat King Cole
gotta come over my house
come over my house
come over every night
and stroke my soul.
--- NOAH ---
Wish me goodnight?
--- CAROLINE ---
That not my job.
--- NOAH ---
How come?
How come you?re so sad
and angry all the time?
--- CAROLINE ---
that ain?t your business, it just ain?t your business.
You?s a nosey child.
How come you like me, I ain?t never nice to you.
--- NOAH ---
That isn?t true! The cigarette.
--- CAROLINE ---
Right. The cigarette.
--- NOAH ---
My mama liked you.
I do too.
You?re implacable,
indestructible, mama said.
I?m always sad.
I like it that you?re always mad.
And I can tell you like me to.
At least I think you do.
