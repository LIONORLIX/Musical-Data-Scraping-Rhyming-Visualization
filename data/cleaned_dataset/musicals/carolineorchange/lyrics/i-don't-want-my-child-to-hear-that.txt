I don?t want my child to hear that.
--- MR. STOPNICK ---
Now I say this with due respect?
--- CAROLINE ---
Negroes stealin white folk statues.
We are asking for disaster,
we?ll be ruint fore this is over.
--- MR. STOPNICK ---
?they got to stop looking for martyrdom
blow the bastards to kingdom come, like the Wobblies used to do!
Show these rednecks a thing or two!
--- GRANDMA & GRANDPA GELLMAN ---
Such a shonde such a tsimmes!
Noah look! Here come the latkes!
And golden may our blessings be!
Just like these lovely latkes we?
--- MR. STOPNICK ---
I been waiting since the 30s,
selling goddam hats for Macys
waiting for the revolution,
for the fight against oppression,
for the worker to take over,
for the poor to rise in fury.
Now the Negro leads the way!
Comes at last the freedom day!
But this martyr business is a ruse!
--- ROSE ---
Hallelujah! Here?s the goose!
Papa, look we saved the pupick
just for you! The pupick, papa!
