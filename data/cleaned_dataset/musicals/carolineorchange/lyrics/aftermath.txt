--- ROSE ---
Hello I?m back!
Back from shopping!
Caroline? Noah! Is anyone home?
Noah, help grandpa with the groceries.
Where?s Caroline, darling?
--- NOAH ---
Caroline left.
--- ROSE ---
She left?
--- NOAH ---
Yes.
--- ROSE ---
Why? Is anything wrong?
--- NOAH ---
No, she just left.
--- ROSE ---
?with the laundry still on?
Noah is there something you aren?t telling me?
--- NOAH ---
And the next day day day Caroline stayed away ?way-way
And she didn?t come back back back
And she didn?t come back back back.
And the next day day day Caroline stayed away ?way-way
And she didn?t come back back back
And she didn?t come back back back.
And the next day day day Caroline stayed away ?way-way
And she didn?t come back back back
And she didn?t come back back back.
--- ROSE ---
Stuart, I?m worried,
she left in a hurry,
I call her at home,
she won?t come to the phone,
her kids say she?s out,
but I have my doubts.
I think she?s there;
this isn?t like her.
Stuart!
--- STUART ---
Maybe she?s ill.
--- ROSE ---
And look, in the bleach cup:
A twenty dollar bill.
--- ROSE AND STUART ---
Noah, please, no monkey biz:
Tell us whose this twenty is.
--- STUART ---
Noah?
--- ROSE ---
Did Caroline find this money in your patns?
--- MR. STOPNICK ---
No, Rose, I think the twenty is mine.
I thought I?d lost it.
Now everything?s fine.
--- NOAH ---
And the fourth day day day Caroline stayed away ?way-way
And she didn?t come back back back
And she didn?t come back back back.
I did it. I killed her. I did it. She died.
--- ROSE ---
Dotty? Rose Gellman.
Is Caroline?oh.
Well why didn?t she call and tell me so?
I?m glad she?s fine, but?
I?ve been worried, a lot,
I couldn?t imagine,
for five days and not?
If she needed time off,
if it?s family stuff,
and things around here have been
sort of tough,
well, not tough, more like tense,
but it doesn?t make sense,
to just up and vanish without an adieu,
I thought maybe she?d gotten the Spanish flu.
Tell her to call.
That?s all that I ask.
I won?t take her to task,
just tell me what?s what.
I worry a lot.
Thanks, Dotty,
You?re swell.
--- Unknown ---
You can all go to Hell!
I?m not the enemy!
--- MR. STOPNICK ---
No, you?re the boss.
--- ROSE ---
Oh, shut up, papa. Forget it. Her loss.
--- STUART ---
I have to go practice.
--- ROSE ---
Great. Thanks a lot, Stu.
--- STUART ---
No, really. I do.
--- MR. STOPNICK ---
So what else is new?
Here?s how I see it:
--- ROSE ---
I didn?t ask.
--- MR. STOPNICK ---
Nonetheless. You want that boy to love you.
--- ROSE ---
I guess, yes of course. And I?ve tried!
At bedtime he?ll only let Stu tuck him in,
if I try to do it ? well, somehow I blew it!
--- MR. STOPNICK ---
And his mother is dead?
--- ROSE ---
Forget it!
--- MR. STOPNICK ---
And everything?s wrong.
--- ROSE ---
No-win.
--- MR. STOPNICK ---
Then you marry his father but you don?t belong.
--- ROSE ---
But how he misses Caroline?
Caroline!
--- MR. STOPNICK ---
Caroline.
Given the givens she?s in perfect position
for the boy to adore her.
She?s competition.
--- ROSE ---
Competition! Oh, yes! And I mean to destroy
the silly attachment of that little boy
for the maid.
Oh I?m the oppressor, right? I?m the employer!
--- MR. STOPNICK ---
I don?t mean you consciously planned to destroy her
in Noah?s affections?
--- ROSE ---
OK fine.
--- MR. STOPNICK ---
Well, not by design.
But maybe you had to?
one way or another.
It?s hard, but not mean.
You got in between.
Maybe Rosie, now you can be his mother.
--- ROSE ---
It figures you figure in three seconds flat
how to make me the villain?
--- MR. STOPNICK ---
I didn?t say that.
--- ROSE ---
I?m glad you came down, now go home, keep in touch,
you?ve made me feel awful, thanks ever so much!
And while you were giving me this third degree
perhaps you neglected to notice that he still won?t let me near him ? so I?ve failed.
--- MR. STOPNICK ---
Wait and see.
--- ROSE ---
Just stop it Papa, stop picking a fight!
--- MR. STOPNICK ---
I didn?t mean to upset you, Rosie. Honor bright.
--- ROSE ---
I?m not the boss.
Her loss.
Leave it be and let it end.
It?s just no way to treat a friend.
