------ Caroline Take My Money Home ------
--- NOAH ---
Caroline takes my money home!
Now I know what they talk about
at the Thibodeaux house, at suppertime.
Before it was a mystery.
Now they count my quarters and
they talk about me!
--- CAROLINE ---
Emmie!
--- EMMIE ---
Mama?
--- CAROLINE ---
Jackie!
--- JACKIE ---
Yes?m?
--- CAROLINE ---
You too, Joe.
--- JOE ---
We done somethin? bad?
--- CAROLINE ---
Hold your hand out.
Go on, now close your eyes:
--- Unknown ---
Open sesame!
Tell me what you see!
something silver shiny all your own now,
all your own.
--- EMMIE, JACKIE, JOE ---
