------ I Hate the Bus ------
--- Unknown ---
I hate the bus
I want my own car
A car with a heater
I want a TV set and more
A big old house
--- Unknown ---
Like this one
But everything new
And cant nobody ever
Can't nobody ever tell me what to do
--- Unknown ---
Go out when I want to
When I don't then I stay
Got magical bracelets
Some bullets bound someway
--- Unknown ---
In every room a TV and my own telephone
And ill live in my house
And ill live in my house by myself all alone
And if I'm lonely it doesn't matter
--- Unknown ---
I think there worse than being lonely
There's people who freeze while they wait on their knees
And they don't know for what
And they just been forgotten
--- Unknown ---
I aint waiting no more
You just wait forever
If you cant say what for
The day comes soon
--- Unknown ---
Ill pack up the nothing I own
And ill live in my house
And ill make it ok by myself
