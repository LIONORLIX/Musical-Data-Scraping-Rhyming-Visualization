------ I Saw Three Ships ------
--- DRYER ---
Small domestic tragedies
bring strong women to their knees?
--- JACKIE AND JOE ---
?I saw three ships come sailing by
on Christmas day, on Christmas day,
I saw three ships come sailing by
on Christmas day in the morning.?

Mama there?s money
down in the laundry!
Dig for the money
down in the laundry!
mama come home.
Jackie got a cavity,
eating the candy you always buying now,
he needs a dentist, and I need five dollars
to go to Beaumont,
to see the Live Nativity,
and Christmas is coming,
and money wanting.
Mama there?s money
down in the laundry!
Dig for the money
down in the laundry!
Mama come home.
