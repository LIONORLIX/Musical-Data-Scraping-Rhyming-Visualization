------ JFK ------
--- GRANDMA & GRANDPA GELLMAN ---
JFK, JFK,
beat the Russians, saved the day,
stopped the Jew-haters and their bomb,
stopped their nuclear pogrom.
Dedicated to undo
American anti-Semites too!
Friend to the colored, friend to the Jew,
?Ask not what your country
can do for you!?
--- DOTTY ---
JFK, JFK,
swore to help black folk some day.
Sure he was a little slow,
getting round to doing so,
but he swore it and I know
he was set to help our cause,
meant to pass some proper laws.
--- DOTTY, GRANDMA AND GRANDPA ---
Toleration for all men!
We shall not see his like again.
He is gone now, JFK?
--- DOTTY ---
Our almost-friend is gone away.
--- NOAH ---
Dimes and quarters
underwater?
--- NOAH & THE MOON ---
?where the moon can?t send her beams.
--- MOON ---
Moon change, moon change?
--- NOAH ---
Bedtime them?
--- NOAH & THE MOON ---
?it?s time for dreams.
