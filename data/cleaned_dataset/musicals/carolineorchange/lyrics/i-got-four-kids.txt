It nineteen-sixty-three and I
I wish every afternoon I die:
cook and clean and mind that boy,
doing housework doing laundry
sixteen feet below the sea.
Thought for sure by now I be?
Someplace cooler, someplace high,
someplace where there?s something dry
don?t come from no lectric dryer,
doing something finer,
something not as meek,
as getting hit
and turning cheek;
hit! and turn the other cheek.
Hit! and turn the other cheek,
doing laundry underground
for thirty dollars every week.
Thirty dollars every week.
And I am mean and I am tough but?

Thirty dollars ain?t enough.
Thirty dollars ain?t enough.

Nothing happen underground
in Louisiana.
Cause there ain?t no underground
in Louisiana.
There is only
underwater.
