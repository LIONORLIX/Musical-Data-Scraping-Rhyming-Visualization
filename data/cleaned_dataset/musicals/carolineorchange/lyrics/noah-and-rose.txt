------ Noah And Rose ------
--- ROSE ---
Why do you leave
change in your pockets?
Especially when I have asked you not to?
--- NOAH ---
I forget.
--- ROSE ---
You?ve got to remember!
Look! In the bleach cup,
it?s more than a dollar!
Think of the things you can buy
for a dollar.
Think of what Caroline thinks,
working all day in this horrible basement.
--- NOAH ---
Caroline likes it, the basement, it?s hers?
--- ROSE ---
Working for peanuts
and?likes it?
I doubt that!
Don?t be a baby!
She?s poor!
--- NOAH ---
She is not!
--- ROSE ---
Oh Noah, of course she is.
She?s poor, it?s embarrassing
to have her find money
just left in the laundry:
think of the things she could do with these quarters,
these nickels and pennies?
--- NOAH ---
Caroline is king
and Caroline is queen
and Caroline is stronger than my dad;
it isn?t true,
she doesn?t hate it,
she?s a lot stronger
