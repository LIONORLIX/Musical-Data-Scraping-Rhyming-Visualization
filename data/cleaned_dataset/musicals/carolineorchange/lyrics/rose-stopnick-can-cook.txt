------ Rose Stopnick Can Cook ------
--- GRANDMA AND GRANDPA GELLMAN ---
In Nineteen-Sixty-Three
our widowed son
a tragedy, tragedy
married a friend
from New York City
a pity, a pity.
--- STUART ---
Wonderful things
come to an end.
Marry a friend.
Make a new start.
--- GRANDMA AND GRANDPA GELLMAN ---
Rose Stopnick can cook.
Rose Stopnick is lovely.
Rose Stopnick doesn?t smoke.
Or play the bassoon.
--- CAROLINE ---
I?m going home, Mrs. Gellman,
I don?t wash the clothes.
--- ROSE ---
Please, call me Rose.
--- CAROLINE ---
I put up the shrimps,
I wash the floor upstairs,
I dusted the World Book Encyclopedia,
I ironed the linens?
--- ROSE ---
And please take some cabbage
home to your kids.
--- CAROLINE ---
Don?t like the smell. Night, Mrs. Gellman.
--- NOAH & GRANDMA & GRANDPA GELLMAN ---

--- STUART ---
Make a new start.
--- NOAH ---
Rose Stopnick is nice to me.
--- STUART ---
Make a new start.
--- ROSE ---
Noah, darling, look!
You left change in your pants pockets again!
--- NOAH & GRANDMA & GRANDPA GELLMAN ---
Rose Stopnick doesn?t smoke.
--- STUART ---

--- NOAH ---
I hate her
I hate her
