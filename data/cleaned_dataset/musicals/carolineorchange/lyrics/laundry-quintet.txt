Nothing happens underground
in Louisiana. Cept in this house,
cept here, cept here:
At nine-thirteen Saint Anthony Street
in Lake Charles Louisiana:
This house got
a basement.
--- THE WASHING MACHINE ---
This house got
a basement.
True.
No other house round here gots one.
This one
this one
this one
do.
--- CAROLINE ---
Ain?t very deep for a basement but still
it planted in the swampy soil,
sunk in the mud and the marsh and the mire,
down with the snakes and the snails and the bracken,
root to the bayou
root to the ooze?
--- THE RADIO ---
?singing them sediment topsoil blues,
alluvial delta-silt saltwater ooze.
--- THE WASHING MACHINE ---
Hum hum hum hum
round and round I agitates
while them what does the clothes awaits,
they contemplates and speculates,
in the peace my one-horsepower
lectric motor?s hum creates:
--- RADIO AND WASHING MACHINE ---
What shall be? What lies in store
