------ The Chanukah Party ------
--- THE GELLMANS & MR. STOPNICK ---
Chanukah or Chanukah,
oh Dreydl and Menorah!
We celebrate it even though
it isn?t in the Torah!
Talmud barely mentions it,
the way they kept their candle lit;
sages in their colloquies
say bupkes bout the Maccabees
and how with very little fuss
they routed King Antiochus.
Antiochus! Pooh!
Who cares what all the sages say?&#8232;We celebreate it anyway!
Chanukah oh Chanukah,
from Astrakhan to Panama,
all along that isthmus,
we?re celebrating Chanukah,
especially in America!
--- GRANDMA GELLMAN ---
A whole week more than Christmas!
--- ROSE ---
You may think it?s December,
but Noah, dear, remember,
tonight is Kislev Twenty-Five!
--- THE ADULT GELLMANS & MR. STOPNICK ---
And every single Jew alive,
Oy Noahleh, oy bubaleh,
oy vontzeleh oy pishkeleh,
sings happy happy Chanukah,
especially in America!
American American God shed His grace on thee,
where every Jew?s a Maccabee
and crown?d thy good with brotherhood?
and bade our blessings multiply:
--- NOAH ---
Boruch ata adonai eloheinu melech ha?olam
asher kidshanu b?mitzvotav vitzivanoo
l?hadlich ner shel Chanukah.
--- THE ADULT GELLMANS & MR. STOPNICK ---
Mi kamocha ba-eilim Adonai?
Mi kamocha ne-e-dar ba-ko-desh?
No-ra t?hilot o-se fe-le,
No-ra t?hilot o-se fe-le.
Omayn.
--- CAROLINE ---
Give that liver salad a toss
and watch the goose don?t let it dry.
Spoon them jars of applesauce
and put them pancakes in the fry!
If you don?t fry ?em right away
they start turning grey.
--- NOAH ---
Know why they?re fried in chicken fat?
--- EMMIE ---
To crisp ?em up.
--- CAROLINE ---
Noah, scat!
You?s bothering us, you?s underfoot.
--- NOAH ---
To symbolize the Temple Oil.
--- CAROLINE ---
Dot, don?t let the gravy boil!
Noah, scoot, I got no use
for you tonight.
--- EMMIE ---
How about the goose?
Does that mean something?
--- NOAH ---
That?s just food.
--- ROSE ---
Noah, out! It?s very rude
to bother people when they?re busy.
You aren?t needed in here. Is he?
--- CAROLINE ---
No he ain?t.
--- ROSE ---
Go on, don?t pout.
Go on out, and see our friends, he
never listens!
--- MR. STOPNICK ---
The South is in a mighty frenzy!
--- ROSE ---
Time to bring the latkes out!
Noah tell them food is coming.
--- MR. STOPNICK ---
Wait and see!
The old world?s ending!
Negroes marching!&#8232;Change is coming!
Down with the filthy capitalist chazzerim!
--- ROSE ---
Come and visit with Grandpa Stopnick, all the way from New York City!
--- MR. STOPNICK ---
Just like we predicted back in the 30s,
all the negroes got to do now
is stop this nonsense about nonviolence!
--- GRANDMA & GRANDPA GELLMAN ---
Scary scary such a tsimmes,
negroes in Louisiana
aren?t like in Mississippi,
not as mad as Alabama.
Anyway is this the way
to talk on Erev Chanukah?
Let?s not dwell on ugly things!&#8232;Let?s thank God for the joys He brings!
Watch the colored candles melt!
Spin the dreydl for Chanukah Gelt!
Let?s be merry, let?s be funny!
--- GRANDMA GELLMAN ---
Noah, look!
--- GRANDPA GELLMAN ---
It?s chocolate money!
--- GRANDMA AND GRANDPA GELLMAN ---
Let?s wish our negro neighbors well!
--- MR. STOPNICK ---
And may Bull Connor roast in hell!
--- THE GELLMANS AND MR. STOPNICK ---
Bull Connor! Pooh!
--- GRANDMA & GRANDPA GELLMAN ---
But tonight let?s just forget!
--- GRANDMA GELLMAN ---
Stuart! Play your clarinet!
