------ The Best Night of My Life ------
--- Unknown ---
The best night of my life,
Is here, is now,
knowing you has got to be the greatest thing that ever happened to me
--- Unknown ---
If I could freeze this moment,
and take it home with me,
I would, I would, but time goes by
And oh,
I know that I never can live this moment again, this moment again
--- Unknown ---
The best night of my life,
Don't go, don't go
--- Unknown ---
There's no way to say, "Thank you"
It wouldn't come out right
