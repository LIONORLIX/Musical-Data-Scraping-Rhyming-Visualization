------ Real Love ------
--- Unknown ---
All my little plans and schemes
Lost like some forgotten dream
Seems like all I really was doing
Was waiting for you
--- Unknown ---
Just like little girls and boys
Playing with their little toys
Seems like all they really were doing
Was waiting for you
--- Unknown ---
Don't need to be alone
No need to be alone
--- Unknown ---
It's real love
It's real, yes it's real love
It's real
--- Unknown ---
From this moment on I know
Exactly where my life will go
Seems that all I really was doing
Was waiting for love
--- Unknown ---
Don't need to be afraid
No need to be afraid
--- Unknown ---
It's real love
It's real, yes it's real love
It's real
--- Unknown ---
Thought I'd been in love before,
But in my heart I wanted more
Seems like all I really was doing
Was waiting for you
--- Unknown ---
Don't need to be alone
No need to be alone
--- Unknown ---
It's real love
Yes it's real, yes it's real love
