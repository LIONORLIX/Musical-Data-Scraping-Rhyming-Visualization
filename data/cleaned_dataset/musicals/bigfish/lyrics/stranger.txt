------ Stranger ------

(Will Bloom)
--- Unknown ---
Stranger
--- Unknown ---
I’m feeling stranger
--- Unknown ---
Than I’ve ever felt before
--- Unknown ---
And so much more
--- Unknown ---
Different
--- Unknown ---
Like something old has joined
--- Unknown ---
With something new
--- Unknown ---
But still feels true
--- Unknown ---
I’m passing through a rite that every parent does
--- Unknown ---
I’m walking on some shared familiar ground
--- Unknown ---
Yet every step I take
--- Unknown ---
Is not a step that was
--- Unknown ---
And I’ve found
--- Unknown ---
I like the sound of
--- Unknown ---
Stranger
--- Unknown ---
A child I’ve yet to meet
--- Unknown ---
Becomes my everything
--- Unknown ---
My song to sing
--- Unknown ---
Father
--- Unknown ---
And suddenly the weight of it is real
--- Unknown ---
What do I feel’
--- Unknown ---
I feel connected
--- Unknown ---
In a way I’ve never known
--- Unknown ---
A line from dad to me to new-born son
--- Unknown ---
So from today
--- Unknown ---
I’ll never make a choice alone
--- Unknown ---
One for all
--- Unknown ---
All for one
--- Unknown ---
And when he’s born
--- Unknown ---
I’ll teach him how to use his common sense
--- Unknown ---
He’ll listen and he’ll learn and he’ll excel
--- Unknown ---
I’ll tell my son
--- Unknown ---
That life is lived in clear and present tense
--- Unknown ---
Not only in the stories we can tell
--- Unknown ---
My father told me stories
--- Unknown ---
I could never comprehend
--- Unknown ---
In every tale he’d claim to be the hero
--- Unknown ---
I’ve tried to understand him
--- Unknown ---
But I wonder if I can
--- Unknown ---
Because after almost thirty years
--- Unknown ---
I still don’t know the man
--- Unknown ---
I wish I knew the man
--- Unknown ---
But he’s a stranger
--- Unknown ---
My father is a stranger I know very well
--- Unknown ---
A puzzling shell
--- Unknown ---
Hopeful
--- Unknown ---
What’s on its way may help us both to grow
--- Unknown ---
But I don’t know
--- Unknown ---
I don’t know when I’ll understand
--- Unknown ---
What made him wild
--- Unknown ---
I don’t know why he has the urge to fly
--- Unknown ---
I want to face him like a man and not a child
--- Unknown ---
So I’ll try
--- Unknown ---
I’ll really try
--- Unknown ---
And in time, my boy is sure to see
--- Unknown ---
Brighter days for dad and me
--- Unknown ---
We can do things better than before
--- Unknown ---
So that strangers we will be no more
