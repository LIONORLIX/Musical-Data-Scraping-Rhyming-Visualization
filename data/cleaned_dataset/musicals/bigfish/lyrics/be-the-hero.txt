------ Be the Hero ------
--- Unknown ---
(Edward Bloom)
--- Unknown ---
What if I told you
--- Unknown ---
You could change the world
--- Unknown ---
With just one thought
--- Unknown ---
What if I told you
--- Unknown ---
You could be a king
--- Unknown ---
Anything you desire, boy
--- Unknown ---
Anything on a plate
--- Unknown ---
All within your power to create
--- Unknown ---
I know somewhere in the darkness
--- Unknown ---
There’s a story meant for me
--- Unknown ---
Where I’ll always know exactly what to say
--- Unknown ---
I know somewhere some surprising ending
--- Unknown ---
Waits for me to tell it my own way
--- Unknown ---
Be the hero of your story, if you can
--- Unknown ---
Be the champion in the fight-
--- Unknown ---
Not just the man
--- Unknown ---
Don’t depend on other people
--- Unknown ---
To put paper next to pen
--- Unknown ---
Be the hero of your story, boy, and then
--- Unknown ---
You can rise to be the hero once again
--- Unknown ---
Now the best part of an adventure is the people you meet.
--- Unknown ---
What if I said
--- Unknown ---
I met a witch
--- Unknown ---
When I was very young
--- Unknown ---
What if I said
--- Unknown ---
She showed me how I die
--- Unknown ---
Powerless in the face of it
--- Unknown ---
Terrified in the wood
--- Unknown ---
That was where my life was
--- Unknown ---
Changed for good
--- Unknown ---
Hey!
--- Unknown ---
What if I said
--- Unknown ---
I met a giant,
--- Unknown ---
Wasting in a cave
--- Unknown ---
What if I claimed I rose
--- Unknown ---
To be far braver
--- Unknown ---
Than the brave
--- Unknown ---
All my life of stories, son
--- Unknown ---
And every one is true
--- Unknown ---
So believe me
--- Unknown ---
As I’m telling you
--- Unknown ---
To be the hero of your story
--- Unknown ---
While you may
--- Unknown ---
Be the guy who gets the girl
--- Unknown ---
And saves the day
--- Unknown ---
You don’t need
--- Unknown ---
A book of Greeks
--- Unknown ---
To teach you how
--- Unknown ---
To stay alive
--- Unknown ---
Be the hero of each story
--- Unknown ---
You derive
--- Unknown ---
Then forever you’re
--- Unknown ---
The story who’ll survive
--- Unknown ---
Every tale that you invent
--- Unknown ---
Can be a life
--- Unknown ---
That you make real
--- Unknown ---
Where each character
--- Unknown ---
You meet
--- Unknown ---
Becomes your friend
--- Unknown ---
You don’t need to be
--- Unknown ---
A novelist
--- Unknown ---
To make believe what’s
--- Unknown ---
Waiting ‘round the bend
--- Unknown ---
(Edward & Company)
--- Unknown ---
Be the hero of your story
--- Unknown ---
'Til it's done
--- Unknown ---
Why go promenade when you
--- Unknown ---
Were born to run
--- Unknown ---
(Edward Bloom)
--- Unknown ---
If you understand
--- Unknown ---
This premise
--- Unknown ---
You will never be alone
--- Unknown ---
(Edward & Partial Cast)
--- Unknown ---
You can conquer
--- Unknown ---
Every challenge
--- Unknown ---
You can face each
--- Unknown ---
Stepping stone
--- Unknown ---
(Edward & All)
--- Unknown ---
Be the hero of your story
--- Unknown ---
(Edward Bloom)
--- Unknown ---
What if I swore
--- Unknown ---
I saw a mermaid swimming
--- Unknown ---
In the mist
--- Unknown ---
What if I told you
--- Unknown ---
She would be the first girl
--- Unknown ---
That I kissed
--- Unknown ---
Out there in the water
--- Unknown ---
Filled with eagerness and fear
--- Unknown ---
Here is what she whispered
--- In my ear ---
--- Unknown ---
(Edward & Company)
--- Unknown ---
Be the hero of your story
--- Unknown ---
Be the hero of your story
--- Unknown ---
Be the hero of your story
--- Unknown ---
(Edward Bloom)
--- Unknown ---
Now listen, son: Now one day I met this fisherman, see’
--- Unknown ---
(Frustrated Fisherman)
--- Unknown ---
Oh you gotta help me! If I don’t catch a fish, my family’s gonna starve!
--- Unknown ---
(Edward Bloom)
--- Unknown ---
The fish are sleepin’! You gotta get ‘em movin’. Try the Alabama Stomp!
--- Unknown ---
Works every time!
--- Unknown ---
Something about this rythym really gets their fins movin’. Give a man a fish, you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish, you feed him for a lifetime. Teach a man the Alabama Stomp, you feed his soul!
--- Unknown ---
I know somewhere in the future
--- Unknown ---
There’s adventure waits for me
--- Unknown ---
Filled with mystery and people
--- Unknown ---
I can love
--- Unknown ---
I know out there
--- Unknown ---
On the road of life
--- Unknown ---
I’ll live the story I’ve been
--- Unknown ---
Dreaming of
--- Unknown ---
(Company)
--- Unknown ---
Live the story I’ve been
--- Unknown ---
Dreaming of!
--- Unknown ---
Be the hero every time
--- Unknown ---
You get the chance
--- Unknown ---
If the music stops
--- Unknown ---
Continue with the dance
--- Unknown ---
(Edward Bloom)
--- Unknown ---
On a wing or on a prayer
--- Unknown ---
You get there
--- Unknown ---
Only with your voice
--- Unknown ---
(All)
--- Unknown ---
Be attentive
--- Unknown ---
Be inventive
--- Unknown ---
Be the first one to rejoice
--- Unknown ---
With the story in your heart
--- Unknown ---
You won’t need
--- Unknown ---
Any other choice
--- Unknown ---
You’re a hero,
--- Unknown ---
Fighting dragons, winning wars
--- Unknown ---
Be the hero
--- Unknown ---
And the world will soon be yours!
