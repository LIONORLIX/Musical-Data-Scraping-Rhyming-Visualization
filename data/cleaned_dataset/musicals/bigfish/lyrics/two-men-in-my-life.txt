------ Two Men in My Life ------
--- Unknown ---
(Sandra Bloom)
--- Unknown ---
There are two men in my life
--- Unknown ---
Him and you
--- Unknown ---
There are two men who’ll be speaking
--- Unknown ---
When I’m through
--- Unknown ---
There are few men like your dad
--- Unknown ---
Not easy to define
--- Unknown ---
I know he isn’t perfect
--- Unknown ---
But he’s mine
--- Unknown ---
There are two men in my life
--- Unknown ---
Him and you
--- Unknown ---
And I never want to choose between the two
--- Unknown ---
He distorts and he invents
--- Unknown ---
Some stories don’t make sense
--- Unknown ---
But why should that confuse you
--- Unknown ---
Why not let the man amuse you’
--- Unknown ---
He tells a harmless tale
--- Unknown ---
That always drives you mad
--- Unknown ---
But aren’t you telling stories too
--- Unknown ---
Your point of view
--- Unknown ---
Just different from your dad
--- Unknown ---
There are two men in my life
--- Unknown ---
Him and you
--- Unknown ---
And the stories I believe in
--- Unknown ---
All come true
--- Unknown ---
He can give you what you need
--- Unknown ---
But you should take the lead
--- Unknown ---
There is magic in the man
--- Unknown ---
Please find it while you can
