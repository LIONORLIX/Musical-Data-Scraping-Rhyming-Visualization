------ Showdown ------
--- Will Bloom ---
You see this man?
This tired man?
He's a liar and scoundrel to the core!
--- Edward Bloom ---
You see this boy?
Ungrateful boy?
Knockin' on some long forgotten door.
--- Will ---
Now I know,
I know,
Something he's been hidin'
Something that his pride will not reveal.
--- Edward ---
He wastes his time
Accusing me
What exactly does this fellow feel?
--- Will ---
I feel like there's gonna be a hangin' tonight!
There's gonna be a hangin' tonight!
There's gonna be
We're soon to see
A hell of a fight
There's gonna be a hangin' tonight!
--- Dance/Instrumental Break ---
--- Will ---
There's gonna be a hangin' tonight!
--- ALl ---
That's right!
Yes, there's gonna be a hangin'
Tonight!
--- Will ---
You see this folder
In my hand
You know exactly what it is
--- Edward ---
Do I?
--- Will ---
Who'll be the first to tell us?
--- Edward ---
Tell all you want but you will never understand
--- Will ---
So what comes next?
--- All [Overlapping] ---
What comes next?
Comes next?
Abide the law.
Abide the law.
You get a trial
A trial
A trial
--- Edward [Spoken] ---
Friends!
Life is a trial!
--- Will [Spoken] ---
No! You-
--- Edward [Spoken] ---
Son!
[Sung]
You can't go back to what you were
Your life won't re-run
And you can't undo the things
That you prefer be undone
You can never change the past
Though it may haunt every breath
You can drown but be reborn
If you're not frightened of death!
--- Unknown ---
You're so sure that I'm a rotten father
Absent and lame
Never interested in staying home
Or homecoming game
--- Unknown ---
But maybe you're the one
Imperfect son
Who overreacts
Better check with all your sources
Before twisting the facts!
--- Will ---
So by no means did you visit Ashton?
--- Edward ---
Back in my youth.
--- All ---
Can you please explain precisely
Why you're hiding the truth?
--- Edward ---
I'm not hiding the truth!
--- Unknown ---
Will [spoken]: Your Honor!
[sung]
I would like to submit
One more major piece of evidence
--- All ---
And then you'll acquit!
--- Will ---
Would you kindly tell the jury
What you hold in the air?
--- Edward ---
It says right here that it's a deed.
--- All ---
To what?
--- Edward ---
A house.
--- Will ---
Tell me where.
--- Edward ---
Really son,
I don't know what you think
You're tryin' to prove.
--- All ---
Where's the house?
--- Edward [Overlapping] ---
It says in Ashton.
Give me that!
--- Will [Overlapping] ---
And that's somewhere that you've
Never been to since your boyhood
But this deed spells it out!
There is someone living in this house
--- Edward ---
Now what's this about?
--- Will ---
You insist you've never been there!
--- Edward ---
Well, that might be the case!
--- Will ---
Ahh! You're lyin'!
--- Edward [yelling] ---
That's enough!
--- Will ---
You're lyin' right to my face!
--- Judge [Spoken] ---
Who is Jenny Hill?
--- Edward ---
Oh, come on Doc,
How long have you and me been friends, huh?
--- Judge [spoken] ---
Take him away!
--- Edward [spoken] ---
Oh come on! No!
--- All ---
Now there's gonna be a hangin' tonight!
There's gonna be a hangin' tonight!
There's gotta be a sturdy scene
At the end of the line
'Cause there's gonna be a hangin'
Gonna be a hangin'
There's gonna be a hangin'
Gonna be a hangin'
A hangin'!
A hangin'!
A hangin'!
A hangin'!
