------ What's Next ------
--- WILL ---
--- First things first ---
We're in this prison cell
Have to find a way
To break out
Find another place
To stake out
--- Unknown ---
Look around
Be sure we aren't seen
Slowly check the door
Before we're spotted
Were we spotted?
--- Unknown ---
I know
You've been
A secret double agent
But we can turn the page
Into another kind of tale
--- Unknown ---
Let's go
The door
Is just our first opponent
So step out of your
State of shock
We only need to
Pick this lock...
--- EDWARD ---
--- Unknown ---
(reveals Key to the City)
No need!
--- WILL ---
--- Unknown ---
"What's next" is all
Anyone needs to begin
What's next
Has been a friend to you
What's next to do?
One word and then
Suddenly one more again
Just like a pen
Writing a perfect tale
--- Unknown ---
Out the door
And pray the coast is clear
--- DR. BENETT ---
--- Unknown ---
Edward?
--- WILL ---
--- Unknown ---
Noses to the ground
Before we're spotted
--- EDWARD ---
--- Unknown ---
We were spotted!
--- WILL ---
--- Unknown ---
So, now we face
The ultimate decision Relinquish our control
As we surrender up the fight
Or else we say
Hello to the collision
Just do our job and do it well
--- EDWARD ---
--- Unknown ---
Or better yet
Let's run like hell!
--- WILL ---
--- Unknown ---
"What's next" is all
Anyone needs to begin
What's next
Has been a friend to you
What's next to do?
One word and then
Suddenly one more again
Just like a pen
Writing a perfect tale
--- EDWARD ---
--- Unknown ---
Will, look! My old Chevy!
--- WILL ---
--- Unknown ---
Edward Bloom
How did you swim through
Danger in the world
What was in the heart that
Beats inside you?
Were you simply wetter than
The ordinary average man
Or was it just your fins and
Scales to guid you to:
--- Unknown ---
What's next
--- EDWARD ---
--- Unknown ---
We start the car
--- WILL ---
--- Unknown ---
What's next?
--- EDWARD ---
--- Unknown ---
We hit the road!
--- WILL ---
--- Unknown ---
What's next?
--- EDWARD ---
--- Unknown ---
We find the river
--- WILL ---
--- Unknown ---
What's next? What's next?
--- EDWARD ---
--- Unknown ---
I don't, I don't know...
--- WILL ---
--- Unknown ---
And who do we see
At the river
To greet you
Everyone there at the river
To meet you
Everyone you ever knew
Ever spoke of
Waiting for you to arrive
--- Unknown ---
Now, can you see Karl
By the tree in the distance
Amos arrives with his usual flair
Zacky and Don
Gathered 'round, cherring on
Yes, even the Witch is there
She is there!
--- WILL ---
--- Unknown ---
"What's next" is all
Anyone needs to begin
What's next
Has been a friend to you
What's next to do?
--- Unknown ---
EDWARD'S FRIENDS
--- Unknown ---
Edward Bloom
We've come to say goodbye
Come to tell you why
We've always loved you
Yes, we loved you
--- WILL ---
--- Unknown ---
Only one dad
Only inspiring one son
Edward, you're done
Writing your perfect tale
Telling the perfect tale
--- Unknown ---
EVERYONE but EDWARD
