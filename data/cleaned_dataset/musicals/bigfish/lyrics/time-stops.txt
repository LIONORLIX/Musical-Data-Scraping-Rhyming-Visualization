------ Time Stops ------
--- Edward: ---
Time stops when suddenly you see her
Time stops and what you thought you knew changes
and life beyond this moment is better, bigger
--- Unknown ---
Time stops but still your heart is beating
Time stops though you don't take a breathe
She's there and all you've ever wanted is nearer, clearer
--- Unknown ---
I used to think the world was small
Now I don't think that way at all
--- Unknown ---
Time stops when dreams come true before you
Time stops when fantasy is real
I knew this moment was expected
But this good, who could?
--- Sandra: ---
That boy is staring and I feel a chill
I don't know why
That boy is staring and the world is still
Not tumbling by, there's no one talking
But I can hear a thousand voices
What's going on inside me?
That boy is staring is it me he sees?
I can't be sure
If he is staring, should I try to please?
or be demure?
My hand is trembling, but in this moment nothing scares me
What's going on?
--- Edward and (Sandra): ---
I used to see what lies ahead
Now I just see this girl instead
--- Unknown ---
Time stops (and troubles are abandoned)
Time stops the minute (s)he arrives
I see the future in this instant
Subversive. Sublime.
--- Unknown ---
I'd live forever in this moment
If I could stop, stop time
--- Sandra: ---
That boy is staring and I feel a chill
I don't know why
