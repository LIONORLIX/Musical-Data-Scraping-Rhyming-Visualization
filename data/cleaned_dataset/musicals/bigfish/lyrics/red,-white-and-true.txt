What are the colors of the only man I love?
Red, white, and true!
Who is the guy for me announcing victory?
Red, white, and true!
Wherever tension seems to flare,
He is the one who's standing there
And when he leads the way we can stand and say,
Red, white, and true!

What are the colors of the only man I love?
Red, white, and true!
Who is the guy for us, forever glorious?
Red, white, and true!
Whenever evil comes to town,
He is the one who brings it
He's the one who brings it down!
So let him lead the way
As we shout hooray!
Red, he's red white and

Wherever tension seems to flare
He is the one who's standing, standing there

And when he leads the way, we can stand and say
Red (Red, red)
Red (Red, red)
Red (Red, red)
He's red white and true
