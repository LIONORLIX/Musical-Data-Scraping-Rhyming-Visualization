------ One More Opponent ------
--- Anatoly ---
But why is he really here?
A whole year of silence and suddenly here he is
--- Unknown ---
Florence: (Spoken)
He's workking for Global, it's big money!
--- Anatoly ---
So that's all it is then
He has no desire to see you anymore?
--- Florence ---
Who cares what he's up to, you're not playing him
--- Anatoly ---
Although I have a feeling I am
Why is he here?
--- Florence ---
Don't talk yourself out of form
Vegan's the one
You have to meet
--- Anatoly ---
He's a fine player
--- Florence ---
Predictable, he's a machine
--- Unknown ---
Anatoly: (Spoken)
Yes, a very fine machine
--- Florence ---
So are you
So are we
But there is one other thing
--- Unknown ---
Anatoly: (Spoken)
What?
--- Florence ---
I gather Svetlana is planning to come out here
--- Unknown ---
Anatoly: (Spoken)
My wife? Come to Bangkok? No
--- Unknown ---
Florence: (Spoken)
You must know about it
It's been in the paper they might let her out
--- Anatoly ---
This has to be Molokov right up his street
--- Florence ---
So now you've got one more opponent to beat
Surely you knew
--- Anatoly ---
I did not
--- Florence ---
Well this is a problem we knew we'd be facing soon
--- Anatoly ---
But not now
Not now
