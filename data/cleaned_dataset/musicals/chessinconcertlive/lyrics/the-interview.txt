------ The Interview ------
--- Walter ---
We all want times in our careers,
When we make a little history.
Receive the plaudits of our peers,
Perhaps that time is here right now for me.
Ah Anatoly, if I may, let me say right away,
You will be thrilled, because the other seat is filled
By a long-standing friend of yours.
Action!
--- Frederick ---
Well, here we are face to face once again.
--- Anatoly ---
By any standards, a bizarre reunion!
--- Frederick ---
Is being homeless affecting your game?
--- Anatoly ---
I wouldn't know, as I have a home in England.
--- Frederick ---
No, by a home I mean real home--the place where your family is.
--- Unknown ---
Anatoly: [Spoken]
England is my real home.
--- Frederick ---
What are your latest political aims?
--- Anatoly ---
What are you saying?
--- Frederick ---
Your anti-Russian crusade, has it worked?
--- Anatoly ---
I am no crusader.
--- Frederick ---
What is your true motivation?
That is something we all want to know.
--- Unknown ---
Anatoly: [Spoken]
You know damn well what my motivation is, okay?
--- Frederick ---
Here we see a man under great pressure--
Two fights to fight, yet he could not look fresher.
Chess and politics, I take my hat off.
To any champion, who can pull that off?
--- Unknown ---
I hear your second controls everything.
--- Anatoly ---
Chess is her passion.
--- Frederick ---
But her obsession is East versus West.
--- Anatoly ---
Chess is her passion.
--- Frederick ---
I know a little about her,
And she has got her own ax to grind.
--- Unknown ---
Anatoly: [Spoken]
That is not true.
--- Frederick ---
Aren't you concerned that why your wife is not here?
--- Anatoly ---
I don't discuss my private life in public.
--- Frederick ---
But don't you care that she is not by your side?
--- Anatoly ---
I think I've had enough of this discussion!
--- Frederick ---
Well, we've a little surprise.
We've got your wife on the video.
--- Unknown ---
Walter: [Spoken]
Run the video!
--- Frederick ---
Let her talk to you, give you her version--
How married life has changed, since your desertion.
Hey come back, my friend, we are only showing
Home movies--nothing more, where are you going?
--- Unknown ---
Walter: [Spoken]
Great interview!
--- Unknown ---
Molokov: [Spoken]
Bravo, Mr, de Courcy--Walter!
--- Unknown ---
Walter: [Spoken]
Ah, Alexander!
--- Unknown ---
Molokov: [Spoken]
I am glad that old film did the trick.
We are going to be able to help each other.
--- Unknown ---
Walter: [Spoken]
Heartwarming international cooperation.
--- Unknown ---
Molokov: [Spoken]
I have good news about Anatoly's lady friend.
Florence Vassy's father is alive.
--- Unknown ---
Walter: [Spoken]
Really? Well, this is good news. Have you told her yet?
--- Unknown ---
Molokov: [Spoken]
No, I was going to leave that pleasure to you.
However, my friend, there is one thing-
--- Unknown ---
Walter: [Spoken]
Yes, of course there is.
--- Unknown ---
Molokov: [Spoken]
I think Mr. Sergievsky must lose the match and come home.
Do you not agree?
--- Unknown ---
Walter: [Spoken]
Sure, but there are others beside Vassy we wish to see come home.
--- Unknown ---
Molokov: [Spoken]
That should not be a problem. Do we have a deal?
--- Unknown ---
Walter: [Spoken]
We have a deal, and everybody wins.
--- Unknown ---
Molokov: [Spoken]
Except Anatoly.
--- Unknown ---
Walter: [Spoken]
