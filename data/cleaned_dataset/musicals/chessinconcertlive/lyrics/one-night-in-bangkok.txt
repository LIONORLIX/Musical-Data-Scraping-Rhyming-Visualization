------ One Night In Bangkok ------
--- Unknown ---
Bangkok, Oriental city
And the city don't know that the city is getting
The creme de la creme of the chess world in a
Show with everything but Yul Brynner
--- Unknown ---
Time flies, doesn't seem a minute
Since the tiralinan spa had the chess bars in it
All change, don't you know that when you
play at this level there's no ordinary venue
--- Unknown ---
Like Iceland -- or the Philippines -- or
Hastings -- or -- or this place!
--- Unknown ---
One night in Bangkok and the world's your oyster
The bars are temples but the pearls ain't free
You'll find a god in every golden cloister
And if you're lucky then the god's a she
I can feel an angel sliding up to me
--- Unknown ---
One town's very like another
When your head's down over your pieces, brother
--- Unknown ---
It's a drag, it's a bore, it's really such a pity
To be looking at the board, not looking at the city.
--- Unknown ---
Whaddya mean? Ya seen one crowded,
polluted, stinking town,ya seen 'em  all.
--- Unknown ---
Tea, girls, warm and sweet
Some are set up in the Somerset Maugham suite
--- Unknown ---
Get Thai'd! You're talking to a tourist
Whose every move's among the purest.
--- Unknown ---
I get my kicks above the waistline, sunshine
--- Unknown ---
One night in Bangkok makes a hard man humble
Not much between despair and ecstasy
One night in Bangkok and the tough guys tumble
Can't be too careful with your company
I can feel the devil walking next to me
--- Unknown ---
Siam's gonna be the witness
To the ultimate test of cerebral fitness
This grips me more than would a
Muddy old river or reclining Buddha.
--- Unknown ---
Thank God I'm only watching the game,
Controlling it.
--- Unknown ---
I don't see you guys rating
The kind of mate I'm contemplating
I'd let you watch, I would invite you
But the queens we use would not excite you.
--- Unknown ---
So you better go back to your bars, your
temples, your massage parlours...
--- Unknown ---
One night in Bangkok and the world's your oyster
The bars are temples but the pearls ain't free
You'll find a god in every golden cloister
A little flesh, a little history
I can feel an angel sliding up to me.
--- Unknown ---
One night in Bangkok makes a hard man humble
Not much between despair and ecstasy
One night in Bangkok and the tough guys tumble
Can't be too careful with your company
I can feel the devil walking next to me
