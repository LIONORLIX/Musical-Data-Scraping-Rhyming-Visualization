------ Talking Chess ------

Anatoly: [Spoken]
What are you doing here?
--- Frederick ---
This is the one situation,
I wanted most to avoid.
--- Anatoly ---
Then what on earth are you doing?
You could be better employed.
--- Frederick ---
No, please hear me out. I think I can help.
--- Anatoly ---
If it is about Florence, I am warning you!
--- Frederick ---
No, it is not about her, your wife or your kids;
Or money, or Walter, or Molokov.
--- Anatoly ---
What the hell is it?
--- Frederick ---
I want to talk chess!
--- Unknown ---
Anatoly: [Spoken]
Chess?
--- Frederick ---
Something I've noticed in Viigand,
It is his King's Indian Defense.
One of the lines he's been trying,
Doesn't completely make sense.
--- Anatoly ---
I--I don't understand.
--- Frederick ---
I told you, his King's Indian--
--- Anatoly ---
No, I don't understand why you are helping me.
--- Frederick ---
Because I love chess. Does nobody else?
Jesus! Sometimes I think I am the only one.
How can you let mediocrity win?
--- Anatoly ---
What about Florence's father?
My wife and my children?
--- Frederick ---
You've let them all down already. Win or betray yourself too.
You don't want those shits to get what they want.
--- Anatoly ---
They'll get what they want. They always do.
--- Frederick ---
No, they won't, if you win. Be true to the game.
The one thing you know you can count upon--
--- Anatoly ---
What about Florence?
--- Frederick ---
The one thing is chess!
--- Unknown ---
Anatoly: [Spoken]
Chess?
--- Unknown ---
Frederick: [Spoken]
How can you let mediocrity win? You have one chance left.
Win for chess! You were five-one up. Now it's five all.
Get a grip!
