------ Pity The Child 1 ------
--- Frederick ---
I'm not the kind
To be vindictive--
Holding some childish grudge.
How could I be?
I'm in the spotlight--
Half of the world my judge.
--- Unknown ---
All I demand
Is those I work for,
Those I give all my skills
All my time, and pain,
Those that I entertain.
Give me the same
Compassion in return
