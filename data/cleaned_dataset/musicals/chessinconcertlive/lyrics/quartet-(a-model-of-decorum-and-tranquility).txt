------ Quartet (A Model Of Decorum And Tranquility) ------
--- MOLOKOV ---
We wish, no, must, make our disgust
With this abuse perfectly clear
We're here for chess --
Are the U.S.?
If so, why foul the atmosphere?
--- FLORENCE ---
I must protest -- our delegation
Has a host of valid points to raise.
--- ARBITER ---
It's not just black and white
If I may coin a phrase
As any neutral would attest.
--- FLORENCE ---
But we concede
The fact his masters bend the rules is not your fault
We?ll overlook your crude political assault
Then under protest he'll proceed.
--- MOLOKOV ---
If your man's so sweet
Then why his fighting talk?
If he says we cheat
Then why on earth did he go take a walk?
--- FLORENCE ---
I am not surprised he wanted fresher air
Once he realized there was no hope
Of your guys playing fair.
--- FLORENCE & ANATOLY ---
How sad
To see
--- MOLOKOV & ARBITER ---
It's very sad to see
The ancient and distinguished game that used to be
--- ALL ---
A model of decorum and tranquility
Become like any other sport
A battleground for rival ideologies
To slug it out with glee.
--- ANATOLY ---
I would say with regard to
Him it is hard to
Rebut
Ever-growing suspicions
My opposition's
A nut.
--- FLORENCE ---
I would have said
You'd understand the strain and pressure getting where he's got
For then you'd simply call him highly strung and not
Imply that he was off his head.
--- ANATOLY ---
But how on earth can someone even
Half as civilized and nice as you
Be part of such a self-destructive
Point of view?
I hope he pays you
What you're worth.
--- FLORENCE ---
I'm not getting rich
My only interest
Is in something which
Gives me the chance
Of working with the best.
--- ANATOLY ---
I can only say
I hope your dream comes true
Till that far-off day
I hope you cope
With helping number two.
--- FLORENCE & ANATOLY ---
How sad
To see
--- MOLOKOV & ARBITER ---
It's very sad to see
The ancient and distinguished game that used to be
--- ALL ---
A model of decorum and tranquility
Become like any other sport
A battleground for rival ideologies
To slug it out with glee.
