------ You And I ------
--- Florence ---
This is an all too familiar scene
--- Anatoly ---
Life inperceptivly coming between
--- Both ---
Those whose love is as strong as it should or could be
--- Anatoly ---
Nothing has altered
--- Florence ---
Yet everything's changed
--- Anatoly ---
No one stands still
--- Both ---
Still I love you completly and hope I always will
Each day we get through means one less mistake
Left for the making
--- Anatoly ---
And there's no return
As we slowly learn
Of the chances we're taking
--- Florence ---
I'd give the world to stay just as we are
It's better by far
Not to be too wise
--- Both ---
Not to realize
Where there's truth there will be lies
--- Florence ---
You and I
We've seen it all
Been down this road before
Yet we go on believing
--- Both ---
You and I
We've seen it all
Chasing our hearts desires
Yet I still think I'm certain
This time it will be
My happy ending
