Walter: [Spoken]
So in the end our hero won brilliantly. Surprised us all.
He's played as well as he's ever done.
--- Unknown ---
Florence: [Spoken]
No surprise.
--- Unknown ---
Walter: [Spoken]
Well this is--
He's just announced he's going back to the soviet union.
He seems unable to win without the added thrill of changing sides.
Don't you have a single word to say?
--- Unknown ---
Florence: [Spoken]
No... No.
[Sung]
No, you wouldn't listen anyhow,
And what I'm feeling now
Has no easy explanations.
Hasn't this been a great achievement?
Losing you man and nothing in return.
--- Unknown ---
Walter: [Spoken]
Well, not my man, it's your man. Anyway, Anatoly's
return to the soviet union is a very descent gesture.
It's vertualy assured us some very important collateral--
Including you father. He must have done it for you.
He wouldn't have done it for me. We'll get your father out--
