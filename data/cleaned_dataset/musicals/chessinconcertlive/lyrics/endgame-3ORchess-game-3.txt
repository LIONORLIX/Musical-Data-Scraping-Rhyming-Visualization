------ Endgame 3/Chess Game 3 ------
--- Anatoly ---
They all think
They see a man
Who doesn't know
Which move to make,
Which way to go,
Whose private life
Caused his decline,
Wrecked his grand design.
--- Unknown ---
Some are vicious,
Some are fools,
And others blind
To see in me
One of their kind.
--- Unknown ---
Anyone can be
A husband, lover--
Sooner them than me,
When they discover
Their domestic bliss is
Shelter for their failing.
--- Unknown ---
Nothing could be worse
Than self-denial--
Having to reverse
This endless trial
Of a partner's rather
Sad demands prevailing.
--- Svetlana ---
As you watch
Yourself caring
About a minor
Sporting triumph,
Sharing
Your win with esoterics,
Paranoids, hysterics
Who don't pay attention
To what goes on
Around them--
--- Unknown ---
They leave the ones
They love the way
They found them.
A normal person must
Dismiss you with disgust
And weep for those
Who trusted you.
--- Anatoly ---
Nothing you have said
Is revelation--
Take my blues as red.
My consolation's
Finding out at last
My one true
Obligation.
--- Florence ---
Since you seem to
Have shut out
The world at large,
Then maybe I
Should cut out
Your tiny inessential
World-- inconsequential
In the kind of game
You're playing.
--- Unknown ---
How do you do it?
I tried to be that
Cynical but blew it--
I only changed your life--
You left your
Home, your wife--
I'm not surprised
I slipped your mind.
--- Anatoly ---
Nothing you have said
Is revelation--
Take my blues as red.
My consolation--
Finding out at last
My one true
Obligation.
--- Florence, Svetlana & Soloists ---
Listen to them shout--
They saw you do it,
In their minds, no doubt,
That you've been through it,
Suffered for your art,
But in the end a winner.
--- Unknown ---
We have never heard
Such an ovation.
Who could not be stirred?
Such dedication,
Skill and guts--
A model for the young
Beginner.
--- Unknown ---
They're completely
Enchanted,
But they don't take your
Qualities for granted.
It isn't very often
That the critics soften,
Nonetheless you've
Won their hearts.
--- Unknown ---
How can we begin to
Appreciate the work
That you've put into
Your calling through
The years,
The blood, and sweat,
And tears
The late, late nights,
The early starts?
--- Unknown ---
There they go again!
Your deeds inflame them
Drive them wild, but then
Who wants to tame them?
If they want a part of you
Who'd really blame them?
--- Anatoly ---
And so you're
Letting me know--
--- Florence ---
You're the only one
Who's never suffered
Anything at all!
--- Anatoly ---
How you've hated
My success!
--- Svetlana ---
Well, I won't crawl,
And you can slink back
To your pawns,
And to your tarts.
--- Anatoly ---
And every poison word
Shows that you never         Svetlana:                  Soloists:
Understood!                       Liar!                         Check.
Never!                                Liar!                         Check.
Florence:
Never!                               Liar!                          Check.
Never!                               Liar!                          Check.
Never!
Never!
--- Florence, Svetlana & Soloists ---
Nothing you have said
Is revelation--
Take my blues as red.
My consolation--
Finding out that
I'm my only
Obligation.
--- Anatoly ---
Is there no one in my life
Who will not claim
My right to steal,
My work, my name,
My success,
My fame,
And my freedom?
--- Unknown ---

--- Crowd applauds ---
--- Unknown ---
Florence: [Spoken]
So, you've done it. You're still the champion.
--- Unknown ---
Anatoly: [Spoken]
I had to win to be free.
--- Unknown ---
Florence: [Spoken]
Free for what?
--- Unknown ---
Anatoly: [Spoken]
Free to help your father-- if I go back. Free to play chess--
