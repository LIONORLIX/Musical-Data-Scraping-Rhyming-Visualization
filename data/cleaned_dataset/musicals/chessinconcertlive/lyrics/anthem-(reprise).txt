------ Anthem (Reprise) ------
--- Unknown ---
No man, no madness
Though their sad power may prevail
Can possess, conquer, my country's heart
They rise to fail
--- Unknown ---
She is eternal
Long before nations' lines were drawn
When no flags flew, when no armies stood
My land was born
--- Unknown ---
And you ask me why I love her
Through wars, death and despair
She is the constance, we who don't care
And you wonder will I leave her - but how?
I cross over borders but I'm still there now
--- Unknown ---
How can I leave her?
Where would I start?
Let men's petty nations tear themselves apart
