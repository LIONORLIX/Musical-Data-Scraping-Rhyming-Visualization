Reporter #3: [Spoken]
Excuse me, Mr. Sergievsky, why are you leaving
Russia? What about your wife and family?
--- Reporters ---
How long was this planned?
What made you defect?
Did anyone help you?
And do you expect
To be joined in your exile
By loved ones, e.g. your wife?
Or are you starting again
In all aspects of life?
