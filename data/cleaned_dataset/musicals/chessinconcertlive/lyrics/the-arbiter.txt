--- The Arbiter ---
I've a duty as a referee
At the start of a match--
On behalf of all our sponsors
I must welcome you
Which I do-- there's a catch:
I don't care if you're a champion,
No one messes with me.
I am ruthless in upholding
What I know is right,
Black or white, as you'll see.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^Soloists:
I'm on the case,^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^I'm on the case,
Can't be fooled.^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^Can't be fooled.
Any objection^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^Any objection

And I know best.

Don't push him,

Oh, I'm the Arbiter,

--- The Arbiter & Soloists ---
From square one
I'll be watching all 64.
--- The Arbiter ---
If you're thinking
Of the kind of thing
That we've seen in the past
Chanting gurus, walkie-talkies,
Walkouts, hypnotists,
Tempers, fists,
Not so fast.
--- Unknown ---
This is not the start
Of World War Three--
No political ploys.
I think both your
Constitutions are terrific,
So know you know,
Be good boys.
