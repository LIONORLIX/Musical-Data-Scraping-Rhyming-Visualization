Gentlemen, the score is five games each.

Frederick: [Spoken]
All eyes in the world of chess and indeed many eyes outside
Are turned towards Bangkok, Thailand today,
Where what many here expect to be
The final game of the match in this gripping encounter,
Has just been launched with the ceremonial splendor.
And all the talk is of the recent sensational loss of form
Of world champion Sergievsky,
Who seems certain to surrender his title here today
