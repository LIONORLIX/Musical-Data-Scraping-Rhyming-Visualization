------ Hymn To Chess ------
--- Unknown ---
The Arbiter: [Spoken]
And now let us dedicate ourselves to the spirit
of chess.
--- Chorus ---
We are one united family,
Black and white.
The game--
Our one true guiding light,
Sweeping through
The darkest corners
To express
Countries, classes,
Creeds as one,
In love of chess.
