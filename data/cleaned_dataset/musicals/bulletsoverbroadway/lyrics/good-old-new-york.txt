------ Good Old New York ------
--- Unknown ---
Good old New York, it's never down
We're gonna have a good time
Lovely, and the weather's fine
Knife and fork, a bottle and a cork
That's the way to spell New York
--- Unknown ---
I will be there
In my easy chair
We'll have a good time, baby
I don't mean maybe
