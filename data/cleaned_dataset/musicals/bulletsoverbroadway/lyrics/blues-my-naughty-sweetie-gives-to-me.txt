------ Blues My Naughty Sweetie Gives to Me ------
--- Unknown ---
There are blues that you get from worry.
There are blues that you get from pain.
And there are blues when you're lonely
--- Unknown ---
For your one and only.
The blues you can never explain.
--- Unknown ---
There are blues that you get from longing.
But the bluest blues that be.
Are the sort of blues that's on my mind,
--- Unknown ---
They're the very meanest kind.
