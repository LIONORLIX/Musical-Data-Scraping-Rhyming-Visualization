------ Up a Lazy River ------
--- Unknown ---
Up a lazy river by the old mill run
The lazy, lazy river in the noon day sun
Linger in the shade of a kind old tree
Throw away your troubles
Dream a dream with me-ee
--- Unknown ---
Up a lazy river where the robin's so-ong
Awakes the bright new morning
Where we can move along
Blue skies up above, everyone's in love
Up a lazy river, how happy you could be
Up a lazy river-er with me
--- Unknown ---
Up a lazy river by the old mill run
The lazy, lazy river in the noon day sun
Linger in the shade of a kind old tree
Throw away your troubles
Dream a dream with me
--- Unknown ---
Up a lazy river where the robin's song
Awakes the bright new mornin'
Where we can move along
Blue skies up above, everyone's in love
Up a lazy river, how happy you could be
Up a lazy river-er with me
--- Unknown ---
Woh, up a lazy river by the o-old mill run
The lazy, lazy river in the noo-oon day sun
Linger in the shade of a kind old tree
Throw away your-our troubles
Dream a dream with me
--- Unknown ---
Up a lazy river where the robi-in's song
Awakes the bright new morning
Where we can move along
Blue skies up above, everyone's in love
Up a lazy river, how happy you could be
Up a lazy river-er with me-ee-ee-ee
