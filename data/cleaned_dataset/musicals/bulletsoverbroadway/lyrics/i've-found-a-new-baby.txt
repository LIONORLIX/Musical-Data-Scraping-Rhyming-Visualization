------ I've Found a New Baby ------
--- Ellen ---
I found a new baby,
I found a new boy!
That sweet talkin' baby
Has filled me with joy!
--- Unknown ---
His new way of lovin'
Is all that I crave!
His sweet turtle dovin'
Has made me his slave!
--- Unknown ---
Sweetest kiss, what a kiss!
Full of bliss, can't resist, somehow!
Tells me lies, but he's wise!
Naughty eyes mesmerize, I vow, and how!
--- Unknown ---
I don't mean maybe!
I just had to fall!
I found a new baby!
New baby, that's all!
--- David ---
But, Sheldon Flender -
--- Ellen ---
Everybody looks at me,
Hapiness is what they see!
It is awfully nice to be
On solid ground!
--- Unknown ---
He is charming, I confess!
Oh, more than you, but I digress
Tell me, darling, can you guess
Just what I have found?
--- David ---
You found a new baby!
--- Ellen ---
I found a new baby!
--- David ---
You found a new boy!
--- Ellen ---
I found a new boy!
--- David ---
That sweet talkin' baby!
--- Ellen ---
That sweet talkin' baby!
--- David ---
Has filled you with joy!
--- Ellen ---
Has filled me with joy!
--- David ---
His new way of lovin'!
--- Ellen ---
He has a brand new way of lovin'!
--- David ---
Is all that you crave!
--- Ellen ---
It's everything that I might crave!
--- David ---
He's hot as an oven!
--- Ellen ---
Overheated like an oven!
--- David ---
He's made you his slave!
--- Ellen ---
He's made me his slave!
--- David ---
You found a new baby!
--- Ellen ---
Loves me good, oh so good,
And I should knock on wood,
That's right!
--- David ---
Found a new baby!
--- Ellen ---
I just sigh, I just cry,
When a guy makes me fly my kite,
That's right!
I found a new baby!
Go on, ask me why!
--- David ---
Why?!
--- Ellen ---
You found a new baby,
So baby, why can't I?
--- Ellen & David ---
Who found a new baby?
You found a new baby!
True, you found a new baby!
So say bye-bye to me!
--- Unknown ---
We're through!
You found a new baby!
On cue!
You found a new baby!
Boo-who!
You found a new baby!
So say bye-bye to me!
--- Ellen ---
I found a new baby!
I just had to fall!
I found a new baby!
New baby, that's all!
--- Unknown ---
I found a new baby, yeah!
And baby, that's all!
That's all!
