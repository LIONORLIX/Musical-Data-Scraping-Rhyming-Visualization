------ There's a New Day Comin'! ------
--- Unknown ---
New Day's coming,
As sure as you're born,
There's a new day coming,
start tooting your horn!
--- Unknown ---
See that new day dawning,
let's all knock on wood,
Never say Good morning,
It's BOUND to be good!
--- Unknown ---
New world singing,
It's going to be fine,
New clothes swinging
on everyone's line,
Joy bells ringing,
For your folks and mine,
------ fin ------
