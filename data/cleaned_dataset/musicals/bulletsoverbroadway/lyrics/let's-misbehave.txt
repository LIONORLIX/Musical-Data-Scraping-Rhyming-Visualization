------ Let's Misbehave ------
--- Unknown ---
We're all alone; no chaperone can get our number...
The world's in slumber; let's misbehave.
--- Unknown ---
There's something wild about you, child, that's so contangious...
Let's be outrageous; let's misbehave.
--- Unknown ---
When Adam won Eve's hand, he wouldn't stand for teasin'...
He didn't care about those apples out of season.
--- Unknown ---
They say the spring means just one thing to little love birds.
We're not above birds; let's misbehave.
--- Unknown ---
(Chorus)
--- Unknown ---
If you'd be just so sweet and only meet your fate, dear,
It would be the great event of nineteen twenty-eight, dear.

(Chorus)
