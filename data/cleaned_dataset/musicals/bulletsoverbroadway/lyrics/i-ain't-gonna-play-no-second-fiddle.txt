------ I Ain't Gonna Play No Second Fiddle ------
--- Unknown ---
Let me tell you daddy,
Mama ain't gonna sit in and grieve,
Pack up your stuff
And get ready to leave.
--- Unknown ---
I stood your foolishness long enough,
So now I'm gonna call your bluff,
On certain things I'm gonna call your hand,
So now daddy, here's my plan;
--- Unknown ---
I ain't gonna play no second fiddle,
I'm used to playin' lead.
You must think that I am blind,
You've been cheatin' me all the time!
--- Unknown ---
Why did you still flirt,
And you notice I is hurt?
You see you with my chum,
Do you think that I am dumb?
--- Unknown ---
You cause me to drink,
When I sat down and think,
And see that you never take heed!
--- Unknown ---
I called to your house the other night,
Caught you and your good girl havin' a fight!
I ain't gonna play no second fiddle,
'Cause I'm used to playin' lead.
--- Unknown ---
I caught you with your good time vamp,
So now papa I'm gonna put out your lamp!
And papa, I ain't sore,
You ain't gonna mess with me no more!
--- Unknown ---
I'm gonna flirt with another sheik,
And you're gonna hang your head and weep!
I ain't gonna play no second fiddle,
