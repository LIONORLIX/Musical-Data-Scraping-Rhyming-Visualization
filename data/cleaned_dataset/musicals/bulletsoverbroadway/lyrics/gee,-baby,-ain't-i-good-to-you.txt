------ Gee, Baby, Ain't I Good to You ------
--- Unknown ---
Love makes me treat you the way that I do
Baby, ain't I good to you
Nothing in this world too good for a girl so good and true
Whoa, baby, ain't I good to you
--- Unknown ---
I bought you a fur coat for Christmas
And a diamond ring, yes I did
And a big Cadillac car, and everything
--- Unknown ---
What makes me treat you the way that I do
It must be love baby
That's why I'm so good to you

I bought you a fur coat for Christmas
And a diamond ring,
And a great big Eldorado, and everything

It must be love that makes me treat you the way that I do
Gee,
