------ Two People in Love ------
--- Unknown ---
(Lizzie)
I'm having a vision
I suddenly see it the magnitude of two people in love
How could I have missed it, it had to have been there but I needed you
to show me
We have so much power that's locked inside us
Every time I touch you, it flows
The energy of, capacity of, the infinite sweep of two people in love
in love
Our scale is enormous
Our size is gigantic
There's nothing our minds cannot contain
No walls can enclose us
Our lives have no boundaries
If we can unleash what's in us
That's why it's alright that we fuse together
We know what the universe knows
The potency of, vitality of, emencity of, intensity of the great quantum leap
of people, two people in love
in love
My God it's so scary
You think I'm not frightened
A cosmic invader's on his way
Look at this apartment, he's already changed it and he isn't even here yet
But we will be saved by the laws of science
Einstein proved what everyone knows
When two separate lives are fused into one
The energy's free surpasses the sun and we fill the universe we are
two people in love? in love?
The energy of, capacity of, the infinite sweep people two people two
people in
That's why it's alright that we fuse together
We know what the universe knows
When two separate lives are fused into one
The energy freed surpasses the sun and we fill the universe we are
two people two people two people two people in love ( la la la ahhh
