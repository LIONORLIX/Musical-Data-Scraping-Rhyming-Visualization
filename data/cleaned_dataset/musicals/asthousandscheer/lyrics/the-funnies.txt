------ The Funnies ------
--- VERSE: ---
Sunday is Sunday to my family
But Sunday is not simply Sunday for me
For Sunday's the one day when I love to see the funnies
Breakfast is nothing of which you can boast
But breakfast to me isn't coffee and toast
It's coffee and toast and what I love the most, the funnies
--- REFRAIN: ---
Oh, I love the funnies
I couldn't go without the funnies
A cup o' coffee to my lips and in between the sips
The papers with the capers that are in the comic strips
Which means I'm simply mad about
I mean I couldn't do without the funnies
--- Unknown ---
Oh, in my pajamas
I love to read the Katzenjammers
A little coffee in a cup and Bringing Father Up
I'm dippy over Skippy and his little yellow pup
Which means I'm simply mad about
I mean I couldn't do without the funnies
--- Unknown ---
I'm not concerned with the news of the day
The stories of who murdered who
And for the columns what they have to say
I have no need of
I don't want to read of
--- Unknown ---
The guys and all their honeys
The wealthy daughters or the sonnies
The news about the lovely trips that people take in ships
I'd rather read about the people in the comic strips
Which means I'm simply mad about
I mean I couldn't do without the funnies

And as for what Mister Hearst has to say
