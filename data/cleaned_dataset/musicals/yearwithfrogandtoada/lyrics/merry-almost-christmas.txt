------ Merry Almost Christmas ------
--- Toad ---
Felt as thought there’d be no Christmas
Even though it’s Christmas Eve.
No, it wouldn’t feel like Christmas
Not without you, I believe.
Christmas wouldn’t come without you
Only winter’s cold, I fear
But it really feels like Christmas now that you are here
Sure, it’s cold, but we’ve hot chocolate
And a fire burning away
--- Frog ---
By the fire see the clock lit
--- Both ---
Now it’s almost Christmas Day!
Merry Almost-Christmas, happy that you’re here
Merry Almost-Christmas, Happy Almost-New Year
Christmas feels like Christmas now that you are here
Merry Almost-Christmas, Happy Almost-New Year
--- Frog ---
I could not imagine Christmas
Couldn’t do it if I tried
No, I can’t imagine Christmas,
Not without you at my side
I’ll be with you every Christmas
We both know that’s understood
Many, many night like this one
If we’re lucky, knock on wood!
--- Toad ---
Sure, it’s cold, but we’ve hot chocolate
And a fire burning away
--- Both ---
By the fire see the clock lit
Now it’s almost Christmas day!
--- Birds ---
Merry Almost-Christmas, happy that you’re here
--- All ---
Merry Almost-Christmas, Happy Almost-New Year
Christmas feels like Christmas now that we are here
Merry Almost-Christmas, Happy Almost-New Year
Frog (spoken):
It’s midnight!
--- Toad (spoken) ---
Merry Christmas, Frog.
--- Frog (spoken) ---
Merry Christmas, Toad.
--- Birds ---
Happy Almost New Year!
