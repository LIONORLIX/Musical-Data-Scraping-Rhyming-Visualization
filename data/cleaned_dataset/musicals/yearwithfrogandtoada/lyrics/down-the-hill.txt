------ Down The Hill ------
--- Frog (spoken) ---
Well, here we are at the top of the hill. Look at that view!
--- Toad (spoken) ---
The snow is lovely, but it?s an awfully long way down.
--- Frog (spoken) ---
It will be easy on my sled.
--- Toad (spoken) ---
Oh, I don?t know, Frog.
--- Frog (spoken) ---
Don?t be nervous, Toad! I?ll be behind you the whole time!
--- Toad (spoken) ---
Very well, Frog.
--- Frog (spoken) ---
You?ll see. It?s pleasant. Sledding down the hill. Here we go!
--- Both ---
Down the hill we are sliding
Down the hill gently gliding
Down the hill!
What a thrill, so exciting
It?s a thrill to be riding down the hill!
Oh, to see the scenery
Such a lovely sight!
Don?t you love the greenery
Frosted all in white?
--- Toad ---
This is rather pleasant, Frog!
--- Frog ---
I told you!
--- Toad ---
You were right!
--- Both ---
It?s pleasant sledding down the hill!
--- Frog ---
Now we go where it?s steeper
And the snow somewhat deeper
Down the hill!
--- Toad (spoken) ---
Is it safe, Frog?
--- Frog (spoken) ---
Absolutely, Toad.
There?s a bump up a head there
Which we?ll jump with our sled there
Down the hill!
--- Toad ---
Whoa!!!
My, that was inspiring
Riding through the air
Though, I must admit to you
It gave me quite a scare!
Why are you so quiet, Frog?
Oh, you?re no longer there!
It?s pleasant sledding down the?
AHHHHHHH!!!!!!
--- Mole 1 (spoken) ---
Hello Frog. What are you doing here?
--- Frog (spoken) ---
Hello, moles. I was thrown from the sled, and now Toad is going down the hill alone!
--- Mole 1 (spoken) ---
Oh, he?ll be fine, as long as he doesn?t take the path on the left.
(yelling to Mole 2)Which path did he take??
--- Mole 2 (spoken) ---
The path on the left.
--- Moles ---
Down the hill, going faster
Heading straight for disaster
Down the hill!
--- Mole 1 ---
Watch the trees!
--- Mole 2 ---
Watch the boulders!
--- Moles ---
Tuck your knees to your shoulders
Down the hill!
--- Toad ---
WHAAAAA!!!
I have never been brave,
I have never known how
And chances are slim I?m gonna start now
I?m a terrified toad on a runaway sled
And soon I am going to be dead
I?l be smashed on the side of a rock
So I doubt I?ll be needing that clock!
--- Moles and Frog ---
Down the hill, going faster,
Down the hill, going faster
Down the hill, going faster
Down the hill, going faster
