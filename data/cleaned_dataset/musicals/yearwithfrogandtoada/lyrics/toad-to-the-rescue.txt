------ Toad To The Rescue ------
--- Toad (spoken) ---
It’s Christmas Eve. The fire is burning. The hot chocolate is ready.
But Frog is late. Maybe something has happened to him!
Maybe something bad. Maybe something TERRIBLE!
I must do something! I must help my friend! Frog! Frog! Don’t worry, I’ll save you!
I am prepared for any situation!
If you are lost in the dark,
You are lost in the dark
And your fingers are starting to freeze
I have the light that will cut through the night
So you won’t bump your head on the trees!
Or if you are deep in a hole
You are stuck in a hole
And no one can hear as you shout
I’ll bring a rope
A thick piece of rope
And use it to help pull you out!
I am not afraid! ‘well I am,
But I’ll be brave
Frog! Frog, Frog, Frog, Frog!
You are the one I’m going to save!
If there’s a wolf at your heels
Giant wolf at your heels
And you’re running as fast as you can
I’ll stop the wolf
I’ll, in face, bop the wolf
On the head with a big frying pan!
I am not afraid! ‘well, I am,
But I’ll be brave
Frog! Frog, Frog, Frog, Frog!

Hello, Toad.

You are the one I’m going to?
Frog! You’re here! You’re not lost in the woods?
--- Frog (spoken) ---
No?
--- Toad (spoken) ---
You’re not stuck in the bottom of a hole?
--- Frog (spoken) ---
No?
--- Toad (spoken) ---
You’re not being chased by a wolf’!
--- Frog (spoken) ---
‘no.
--- Toad (spoken) ---
Well, where have you been?
