------ The Kite ------
--- Frog (spoken) ---
Toad?
--- Toad (spoken) ---
Yes Frog?
--- Frog (spoken) ---
We are in luck. There is a nice breeze today. Our kite will fly up and up into the sky.
--- Toad (spoken) ---
Really, Frog? You think so?
--- Frog (spoken) ---
I’m sure of it. Now, I will hold the ball of string, and you will hold the kite and run and RUN!
--- Toad (spoken) ---
Alright. Here I go!
--- Birds(spoken) ---
--- Toad (spoken) ---
What is so funny?
--- Lady Bird 1 (spoken) ---
That kite won’t fly.
--- Lady Bird 2 (spoken) ---
Not in a million years.
--- Boy Bird (spoken) ---
You might as well give up.
--- Toad (spoken) ---
This kite will fly, way up into the air!
--- Birds ---
Look up there in the air
I don’t see it anywhere
I guess it must be on the ground
Boo, boo, boo, in the blue
I don’t see a kite, do you?
I wonder where it could be found!
The weather is lovely, sunny and bright
An absolutely perfect day to go outdoors and DRAG a kite!
Way up high in the sky
That piece of junk will never fly
You’ll never get it off the ground!
--- Toad (spoken) ---
Frog, I give up. This kite will not fly!
--- Frog (spoken) ---
This kite WILL fly!
By and by, it’ll fly
We must make another try
No matter what those birds have said
This time though, when you go
Here’s a trick you need to know
Keep the kite above your head!
--- Toad ---
Way up high in the sky
Now this kite is gonna fly
I’m gonna get it off the ground!
--- Frog (spoken) ---
That’s right!
--- Toad (spoken) ---
I will run and hold the kite above my head, and then you birds will see some real flying!
--- Lady Bird 1 (spoken) ---
Oh, we believe you, Toad.
--- Lady Bird (spoken) ---
We can’t wait to see some real flying.
--- Birds ---
Holy Smokes, Holy Cow!
He’s really got it flyin’ now!
We thought it might have been a dud
We were wrong, you were right.
That’s a mighty kind of kite!
It’s difficult to fly through MUD!
--- Toad (spoken) ---
Frog, this kite is a piece of junk!
--- Frog (spoken) ---
It is NOT a piece of junk!
--- Birds ---
You’ll never get it off the ground!
--- Frog ---
Our kite is a dandy
Superior string
You ran fast and held it high,
But there is just one other thing
--- Toad (spoken) ---
What’s that?
--- Frog (spoken) ---
While you’re running and holding it high, you must jump and wave your arms!
--- Toad (spoken) ---
Very well, Frog. But I’m warning you;
This is my final try
This time, if it doesn’t fly
I’m gonna leave it on the ground
--- Lady Bird 2 (spoken) ---
Yes Toad, wave your arms. That’ll make all the difference.
--- Boy Bird (spoken) ---
I can’t believe he’s gonna try it again!
--- Lady Bird 1(spoken) ---
Toad never learns?
--- Lady Bird 2(spoken) ---
Hey wait a minute?.Look at that!!
--- Boy Bird ---
Could it be?
--- Lady Bird 2 ---
Yup, yup, yup! It looks like it’s
--- Lady Birds ---
Goin’ up!
--- Birds ---
Holy smokes!
--- Boy Bird (spoken) ---
Holy cow!
--- Birds ---
He’s really got it flyin’ now!
Oh my gosh! Golly gee!
That looks mighty high to me!
That kite is really flyin!!
--- Frog and Toad ---
Our kite is really flyin’!
--- All ---
That kite is really off the ground!
