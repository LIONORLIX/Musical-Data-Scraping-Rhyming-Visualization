I love the spring, it?s an excellent season
Wonderful things to see and to do

Spring isn?t?.springy

What is it?
--- Toad (spoken) ---
You know I was thinking, that extra month of sleep really makes a difference!
Smell the flowers, see the plants
--- Both ---
Hear the marching of the ants!
Feel the sun shine, feel the breeze!
--- Toad ---
Look out, Frog, here comes some bees!
--- Both ---
Listen to the birdies sing!
--- Birds ---
Tweet, tweet, tweet, let?s greet the spring!
Let?s greet the spring!
