We flew south for the winter
South for the winter
Just like at the opening of the show.
Tra-la-la-la-la
Tra-la-la-la-la-la
And then of course, the problem with the snow
But the winter now is over!
The snow has all been snowed!
Spring is here, which starts a year
With Frog and Toad!
--- Boy Bird (spoken) ---
Ya know folks’ Through the years, some things change.
And that’s good. And some things don’t change. And that’s good too.
--- Unknown ---
Lady Birds: Chirp Chirpety Chirp!
--- Unknown ---
Boy Bird (spoken): I’ll tell you one thing that will never change.
Frog and Toad will always be good friends.
--- Frog ---
I’d like to sing a little ode
About my good friend Toad
Toad with whom I frequently take tea
He’s not so good at sports
And of course, he’s got those warts, but
Toad has been a lovely friend to me
Toad I feel is vastly under rated
And furthermore I think misunderstood
And in conclusion, I will add
He is the finest friend of all the critters
In the neighborhood
--- Toad ---
I love a lively dialogue
With my good friend Frog
Chatting over cozy cups of tea
He knows just the thing to say
That will brighten up my day, oh
Frog has been a lovely friend to me
Frog is very kindly in his nature
Magnanimous whenever playing host
Of all the creatures in my sphere of influence
I’m found to stop at Frog the most
--- Toad (spoken) ---
Hello, Frog!
--- Frog (spoken) ---
Hello, Toad! Are you hibernating’
--- Toad (spoken) ---
Why, yes, I am! And you’
--- Frog (spoken) ---
Oh, yes, most definitely. And I have had many, many dreams!
--- Toad (spoken) ---
So have I!
--- Frog (spoken) ---
Have they been pleasant dreams’
--- Toad (spoken) ---
Some have been pleasant, and some have been not so pleasant.
But you have been in every one.
--- Frog (spoken) ---
Funny, you’ve been in all my dreams, too!
--- Toad (spoken) ---
I had one not so pleasant dream where we went swimming
--- Frog (spoken) ---
Really’ So did I! And I had a dream that you made the most wonderful cookies.
--- Toad (spoken) ---
Really’ So did I! And I had a dream that we went down a hill on a sled.
--- Frog (spoken) ---
Really’ So did I!
--- Toad (spoken) ---
Well, this is uncanny!
--- Frog (spoken) ---
Remarkable! Well, I’m getting ready to wake up, so you’d better get back to your own dream.
I’ll see you when you wake up!
--- Toad (spoken) ---
Yes, I’d better get back to hibernating. Spring is nearly here!
--- Frog (spoken) ---
Oh, I think it’s just around the corner. Birds’
--- Birds ---
The sun is out
The sky is clear
We came back
Spring must be here
So let’s begin another year
--- All ---
A year with Frog and Toad!
A year with Frog and Toad!
