--- Toad (spoken) ---
Frog, taste these cookies that I have made.
Well?
--- Frog ---
This is a marvelous cookie
Sweet, with an excellent crunch
Perfect to follow a dinner
--- Toad ---
Or just after breakfast
--- Both ---
And prior to lunch
--- Frog ---
Crisp, but not overly brittle
Just a scintilla of spice
Cunningly soft in the middle
--- Toad ---
Let’s have another
--- Both ---
These cookies are nice!
Eating cookies, eating cookies
We’re so happy eating cookies!
Cookies, cookies, cookies we adore!
Cookies, cookies, cookies, cookies
We go kooky eating cookies!
--- Frog ---
Maybe we should stop.
--- Toad ---
Let’s have more!
--- Frog (spoken) ---
Toad, we must stop eating these cookies. I know! Get me a box and some string!
--- Toad ---
Eating cookies, eating cookies
I’m so happy eating cookies!
Cookies, cookies, cookies I adore!
Cookies, cookies, cookies, cookies
I go kooky eating cookies!
--- Frog ---
Maybe you should stop.
--- Toad ---
Just one more!
--- Frog (spoken) ---
Now I will put these cookies in the box and tie it up with the string.
Then we shall no more cookies!
--- Toad (spoken) ---
What an excellent plan. However,
there is a problem with the plan.
--- Frog (spoken) ---
What plan?
--- Toad ---
The no more eating cookies plan.
--- Frog (spoken) ---
What is it?
--- Toad ---
The problem with the plan
--- Frog ---
The no more eating cookies plan
--- Toad ---
Is if we want to eat more cookies, then, in fact, we can!
We could untie the string and open it
--- Frog ---
That’s true
--- Toad (spoken) ---
How ‘bout a cookie?
--- Frog (spoken) ---
Don’t mind if I do!
--- Both ---

--- Frog (spoken) ---
Toad, we have to do something!
--- Toad (spoken) ---
You’re right! I’ll get us some MILK!
--- Frog (spoken) ---
No! No! No! We must stop eating the cookies!
I know, we’ll give them to the birds.
Hey, birds!!
--- Birds ---
What?
--- Frog(spoken) ---
D’you want some cookies?
--- Boy Bird(spoken) ---
Sure! Bring ‘em on!
--- Lady Birds ---
Wait! Should we be eating these cookies?
Or should we rather have worms?
Worms are a product of nature
Toad did the baking.
Think of the germs!
--- Toad (spoken) ---
Well, I never?
--- Boy Bird ---
Toad makes the tastiest cookies.
Go on and try one!
--- Lady Birds ---
They’re great!
--- Boy Bird ---
If you eat one of these cookies,
I’m here to tell you
You’re gonna eat eight!
