------ Find Anatole ------
--- PIERRE ---
Anatole, find Anatole
Anatole, find Anatole
The blood rushes to my heart
It's difficult to breathe
Anatole, find Anatole
Anatole, find Anatole
Not at the ice hills
Not at the gypsies'
Not at Komoneno's
Anatole, find Anatole
Anatole, find Anatole
To the Club
--- Unknown ---
And at the Club all is going on as usual
The members eat their dinners
And gossip in small groups
--- PIERRE & CHORUS ---
Have I heard of Kuragin's abduction?
Is it true Natasha is ruined?
--- PIERRE ---
Nonsense, nonsense
Nothing has happened
Everything is fine
--- Unknown ---
(Pierre's house)
--- ANATOLE ---
Natasha
Natasha
It is essential that I see Natasha
How can I see her?
--- HELENE ---
Anatole, come Anatole
Anatole, hush Anatole
--- Unknown ---
(Marya D.'s house)
--- NATASHA ---
What? What?
I don't believe that he is married
I don't believe you
And I stare like a hunted wounded animal
He can't be married!
--- Unknown ---
(Pierre's house)
--- Unknown ---
SERVANT (to Pierre)
Good evening sir
Prince Anatole is in the drawing room with the Countess
--- HELENE ---
Ah, Pierre
Sweet husband
You don't know what a plight our Anatole has had
--- PIERRE ---
Be quiet
I will not greet you
At this moment you are more repulsive to me than ever
--- Unknown ---
Anatole, come Anatole
Anatole, must speak to you
--- ANATOLE ---
Anatole followed with his usual jaunty step
But his face betrayed anxiety
