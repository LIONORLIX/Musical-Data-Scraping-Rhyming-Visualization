Welcome
Welcome to Moscow
Where faded and fading princesses live
I'll take you where you must go
Pet you a bit
And I'll scold you a bit
My goddaughter, my favorite, Natasha
I will touch you on the cheek
--- NATASHA & SONYA ---
My cousin and I
Are so pleased to be with you
While we wait on our fiancees
Fighting in the war
--- MARYA D. ---
Bright in their things!
What are you dawdling for?
Get the samovar ready!
Bring some rum for the tea!
Sonyushka bonjour
And Natasha my darling
You've grown plumper and prettier
--- NATASHA ---
My cheeks are glowing from the cold
--- SONYA ---
She said
Gazing at Marya with kind, glittering eyes
--- MARYA D. ---
Welcome
Welcome to Moscow
Scruffy and cozy
Like an old dressing gown
--- SONYA ---
Countess Natalya
--- NATASHA ---
Sofia Alexandrovna
--- SONYA ---
How beautiful you looked in the snow
--- NATASHA ---
Cousin dear I love you
Trust no one but you
But I can't bear this waiting
I cry and I cry
Audrey where are you?
I want him now, at once
To embrace him and cling to him
No one can understand
--- Unknown ---
I love him
I know him
He loves me only
He'll come home one day
And take me away
I want nothing more
I want nothing more
--- Unknown ---
Hmmm...
--- MARYA D. ---
First thing tomorrow to Madame Chambord's
Dresses, dresses, we'll buy what we can afford
Then dinner and a game of Boston
Then you'll read to me while I knit!
How wonderful to have you here
Instead of these gossips and crybabies
--- NATASHA & SONYA ---
You'll take us where we must go
Pet us a bit
And scold us a bit
--- SONYA ---
Her goddaughter, her favorite, Natasha
She will touch you on the cheek
--- Unknown ---
(Sonya leaves)
--- MARYA D. ---
Well, now we'll talk
I congratulate you and Audrey
You've hooked a fine fellow!
One of the finest matches in all of Russia
I am glad and relieved,
He'll be the family's saving grace
--- NATASHA ---
I blush happily
--- MARYA D. ---
But his father, Prince Bolkonsky, much dislikes his son's marrying
The old fellow's crotchety!
Of course Prince Andrey's not a child
But it's not nice to enter a family against a father's will
One wants to do it peacefully and lovingly
But you're a clever girl
Just be kind to Andrey's sister
And when the sister loves you,
So will the father
