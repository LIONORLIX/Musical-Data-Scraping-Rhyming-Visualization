------ Pierre & Andrey ------
--- Unknown ---
(Pierre visits Andrey)
--- ANDREY ---
Well, how are you?
Still getting stouter?
--- PIERRE ---
There's a new wrinkle
On your forehead old friend
--- ANDREY ---
It's good to see you
It's been way too long
--- PIERRE ---
My friend, you are in need
Your face is gloomy
--- ANDREY ---
No, I am well
There's a war going on
--- Unknown ---
Forgive me for troubling you;
I have received a refusal from Countess Rostova and have heard reports of your brother-in-law having sought her hand, or something of that kind
--- Unknown ---
Here are her letters
Please give them to the Countess
--- PIERRE ---
Natasha is ill
She has been at death's door
--- ANDREY ---
I much regret her illness
--- PIERRE ---
And he smiled like his father
Coldly, maliciously
--- ANDREY ---
Well, it doesn't matter
--- PIERRE ---
You told me once
A fallen woman should be forgiven
--- ANDREY ---
But I didn't say that I could forgive
I can't
--- Unknown ---
Yes, ask her hand again, be magnanimous, and so on?
Yes, that would be very noble
But I can't be that man
If you wish to be my friend
Never speak of that again
--- Unknown ---
Well, goodbye
