------ In My House ------
--- MARYA D. ---
You shameless good-for-nothing!
You vile, shameless girl!
In my house!
In my house!
A nice girl! Very nice!
--- Unknown ---
You dirty nasty wench of a thing
Now don't you say one word
In my house!
In my house!
Horrid girl, hussy!
--- Unknown ---
It's lucky for him he escaped, but I'll find him!
Now you listen to me when I speak to you!
Now you listen to me when I speak to you!
In my house!
In my house!
Do you hear what I am saying or not?
--- SONYA ---
Natasha's whole body shook
With noiseless, convulsive sobs
Marya touched her hand to her face
--- NATASHA ---
Don' touch me!
Let me be! What is it to me? I shall die!
--- MARYA D. ---
What are we to tell your father? Eh?
In my house!
In my house!
What are we to tell Prince Andrey? Eh?
Oh what do we tell your betrothed?
--- NATASHA ---
I have no betrothed, I have refused him!
--- SONYA ---
Natasha, come here, kiss me
Press your wet face to mine
--- NATASHA ---
Don't touch me!
--- MARYA D. ---
Why didn't he come to the house,
Why didn't he openly ask for your hand?
You were not kept under lock and key!
Carrying you off like some gypsy girl!
And if he had carried you off, don't you think your father would have found him?
Your father, I know him,
He will challenge him to a duel and what then? Will that be all right? Eh?
He's a scoundrel, he's a wretch! That's a fact!
--- NATASHA ---
He is better than any of you I say
He is better than any of you I say
Why did you interfere! Oh God, what is it all?!
What is it?
Who are you to tell me anything?
Sonya, why?
Go away!
Everyone, go away!
--- Unknown ---
Marya Dmitryevna tried to speak again but Natasha cried out
Go away! Go away! You all hate and despise me!
And she threw herself down on the sofa
--- MARYA D. ---
Natasha!
Natalya...
--- Unknown ---
I put a pillow under her head
Covered her with two quilts
Brought her a glass of lime-flower water
But Natasha did not respond
Well, let her sleep
Let her sleep
--- Unknown ---
(Marya D. leaves)
--- NATASHA ---
But Natasha was not asleep
Her face was pale
Her eyes wide open
All that night she did not sleep or weep
She sat at the window
