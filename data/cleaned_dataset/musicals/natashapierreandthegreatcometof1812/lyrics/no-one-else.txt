------ No One Else ------

The moon -
First time I heard your voice
Moonlight burst into the room
And I saw your eyes
And I saw your smile
And the world opened wide
And the world was inside of me
--- Unknown ---
And I catch my breath
And I laugh and blush
And I hear guitars
You are so good for me
--- Unknown ---
I love you I love you I love you I love you I love you
--- Unknown ---
Oh the moon
Oh the snow in the moonlight
And your childlike eyes
And your distant smile
I'll never be this happy again
You and I
And no one else
--- Unknown ---
We've done this all before
We were angels once
Don't you remember?
Joy and life
Inside our souls
And nobody knows
Just you and me
It's our secret
--- Unknown ---
This winter sky
How can anyone sleep?
There was never such a night before!
I feel like putting my arms round my knees
And squeezing tight as possible
And flying away
Like this...
--- Unknown ---
Oh the moon
Oh the snow in the moonlight
And your childlike eyes
And your distant smile
I'll never be this happy again
You and I
You and I
You and I
And no one else
--- Unknown ---
Maybe he'll come today
Maybe he came already
And he's sitting in the drawing room
