------ The Ball ------
--- ANATOLE ---
Waiting at the door
Waiting at the door
Waiting
--- Unknown ---
Waiting at the door
Waiting at the door
Waiting
--- Unknown ---
Waiting at the door
Waiting at the door
Waiting
And there she is
--- Unknown ---
(The ball begins; they dance)
--- NATASHA ---
I am seized by feelings of vanity and fear
There is no barrier between us
Whispers and moans and ringing in my ear
There is no barrier between us
Divine, delicious
But I do not see or hear anything
I'm borne away to a senseless world
So strange, so remote
I don't know good from bad
Anatole
Anatole
I'm so frightened
--- ANATOLE ---
You are enchanting
--- NATASHA ---
And as we danced he pressed my waist and hand
And told me I was
--- NATASHA & ANATOLE ---
Bewitching
--- ANATOLE ---
And I love you
--- NATASHA & ANATOLE ---
Bewitching
--- ANATOLE ---
And I love you
--- NATASHA ---
And during the ecossaise, he
--- NATASHA & ANATOLE ---
Gazed in my eyes
--- NATASHA ---
My frightened eyes
--- Unknown ---
Such confident tenderness
I could not say what I had to say
--- ANATOLE ---
Don't lower your eyes
I love you
I am in love dear
I am in love
--- Unknown ---
Gaze in my eyes
I love you
You are bewitching
What can I do
Darling what can I do
--- NATASHA ---
Don't say such things
I am betrothed
I love another
--- ANATOLE ---
Don't speak to me of that!
When I tell you I am madly, madly, in love with you!
Is it my fault that you're enchanting?
--- NATASHA ---
I'm so frightened
I don't understand anything tonight
--- ANATOLE ---
I'm here now
--- Unknown ---
(Natasha breaks away)
--- ANATOLE ---
Natalie!
--- NATASHA ---
I can feel your eyes upon me
--- ANATOLE ---
Blocking her path, I bring her face close to mine
--- NATASHA ---
His large, glittering, masculine eyes are so close to mine
That I see nothing else
--- ANATOLE ---
Is it possible that I should never see you again?
I love you madly!
Can I never?
Natalie?
--- NATASHA ---
You press my arm
You press my arm
--- ANATOLE ---
Natalie?
--- NATASHA ---
You're hurting my hands
--- ANATOLE ---
Natalie?
--- NATASHA ---
I don't understand
I have nothing to say
--- Unknown ---
(They kiss)
--- NATASHA ---
Burning lips press to mine
Tell me what just happened
--- Unknown ---
I'm trembling
So frightened
--- Unknown ---
Andrey
--- Unknown ---
But I love you
Of that there is no doubt
How else could all of this have happened?
How else could we have kissed?
It means that I have loved you from the first
It means that you are kind, noble, and splendid
And I could not help loving you
--- Unknown ---
I will love you Anatole
I'll do anything for you
--- NATASHA & ANATOLE ---
