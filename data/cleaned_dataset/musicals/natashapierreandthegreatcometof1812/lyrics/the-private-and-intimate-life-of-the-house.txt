------ The Private and Intimate Life of the House ------
--- BOLKONSKY ---
I've aged
I've aged so very much
I fall asleep at the table
My napkin drops to the floor
--- Unknown ---
I'm full of childish vanities
I forget things
And I love in the past
I've aged so very much
--- Unknown ---
People enjoy me though
I come in for tea in my old-fashioned coat and powered wig
And I tell stories
And utter scathing critiques
--- Unknown ---
This old-fashioned house
With its gigantic mirrors and powered footmen
And this stern, shrewd old man
A relic of the past century
With his gentle daughter
Is a majestic and agreeable spectacle
--- MARY ---
But besides the couple hours during which we have guests
There are also twenty-two hours in the day
During which the private and intimate life of the house continues
--- BOLKONSKY ---
Bring me my slippers
--- MARY ---
Yes father yes father
--- BOLKONSKY ---
Bring me my wine
--- MARY ---
Yes father yes father
Oh father
--- Unknown ---
And I never go anywhere
Never invited
For who would take care of him
Who would take care
--- MARY & BOLKONSKY ---
And I have no friends
No no no
--- BOLKONSKY ---
Girl, all my friends are dead
--- MARY ---
No one
--- BOLKONSKY ---
All my friends are dead
--- MARY ---
Time is moving
It's now or never
My fate is slipping past me
--- BOLKONSKY ---
Silence! Silence!
--- MARY ---
Yes father yes father
--- BOLKONSKY ---
Shut your damn mouth girl
Shut your damn mouth
I can hurt you
--- MARY & BOLKONSKY ---
I can hurt you
--- MARY ---
But I never ever ever ever would
This is just how it is
It's just how he is
I'm always to blame
--- Unknown ---
He could beat me
Or treat me like a dog
Make me fetch wood or water
And that's just how it is
Oh father
I love you father
--- Unknown ---
Time is moving
It's now or never
I've abandoned the hope of getting married
--- BOLKONSKY ---
Ah! What's this, a young suitor?
Ah, come in come in
--- Unknown ---
But don't sit down
Don't sit down
I'm cold to you
Yes I'm mean to you
Now be gone be gone be gone
And don't come back!
--- Unknown ---
Maybe I'll marry someone myself
Some cheap French thing
Oh that offends you does it?
Ah, come in my dear, come in my dear, come in
--- MARY ---
And he draws her to him
And he kisses her hand
Embraces her affectionately
And I flush and run out of the room
--- BOLKONSKY ---
Come back here
Let an old man have his fun
Wipe away your tears girl
I don't want your tears
--- MARY ---
On that horrible woman
Vile and inhuman
She's using you, Papa
Wants your money Papa
To take advantage of your weakness like that
It's disgusting
My voice breaks
--- BOLKONSKY ---
It's my money
And I'll throw it where I want
Not at you!
And not at Andrey's harlot!
It's my money, my money,
Mine all mine!
--- Unknown ---
Insolent girl!
Insolent girl!
Where-
Where-
--- Unknown ---
Where are my glasses?
Where are, where are they?
Where are my glasses?
Where are-
Where-
--- Unknown ---
Oh God-
Oh God I'm frightened
Oh God I've-
I've aged, I've aged so very much
Oh God I'm frightened
Where-
Where are my glasses?
Where are my, where are my-
Where are my glasses?
--- MARY ---
There are there upon his head
They are there upon his head
The pride of sacrifice
Gathers in my soul
They are there upon his head
--- Unknown ---
And he forgets things
He lives in the past
He falls asleep at the table
His napkin drops to the floor
His shaking head
Sinks over his plate
--- Unknown ---
He is old and feeble
And I dare to judge him
I disgust myself
