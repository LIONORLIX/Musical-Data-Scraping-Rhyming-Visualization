------ Natasha & Bolkonskys ------
--- NATASHA ---
I know they'll like me
They can't help but like me
Everyone has always like me
His father, my Andrey's father
His sister, my Andrey's sister
There in no reason for them not to like me
--- Unknown ---
Are the Prince and Princess at home?
--- SERVANT ---
The Prince in not receiving,
But the Princess begs you to walk up
--- MARY ---
Oh
Oh, hello
Won't you come in
--- NATASHA ---
Hello
--- Unknown ---
(Natasha and Mary awkwardly move to a table in silence)
--- MARY ---
And from the first glance I do not like Natasha
Too fashionably dressed
Frivolous and vain
Her beauty, youth, and happiness
My brother's love for her
--- Unknown ---
And my father -
--- BOLKONSKY ---
I do not wish to see her!
--- MARY ---
I know at any moment he might indulge in some freak
--- NATASHA ---
I'm sorry the Price is still ailing
--- BOLKONSKY ---
Songstress!
--- NATASHA ---
I am not afraid of anyone
--- Unknown ---
But such hesitation
Such unnatural manners
--- Unknown ---
And from the first glance I do not like Princess Mary
Too plain and affected
Insolent and dry
I shrink into myself
Assume an offhand air
--- MARY ---
Which alienates me still more
--- NATASHA & MARY ---
Constrained and strained
Constrained and strained
Constrained and strained
Irksome
Irksome
--- Unknown ---
(The Prince enters in his dressing gown)
--- BOLKONSKY ---
Ah! Ah Madam!
Countess Rostova, if I am not mistaken-
Oh! Oh I beg you to excuse me, excuse me, my costume, this dressing gown-
I did not know, my poor girl
God is my witness, I did not know you had honored us with a visit
I came in such a costume only to see my daughter
God is my witness, I didn't know
My poor girl
--- MARY ---
And he looked at her once
Head to toe
And left muttering
--- NATASHA ---
I must take my leave
--- MARY ---
Please wait -
--- Unknown ---
Dear Natalie
I want you to know how glad I am my brother has found happiness
--- NATASHA ---
Is that the truth?
I think it is not convenient to speak of that now
Dear Princess
--- MARY ---
She said
With such dignity and coldness
--- NATASHA ---
Though I felt tears choking me
--- Unknown ---
What have I said, what have I done?
Crying like a child
Oh, they were so awful!
Oh, it all hurts so terribly
Andrey
