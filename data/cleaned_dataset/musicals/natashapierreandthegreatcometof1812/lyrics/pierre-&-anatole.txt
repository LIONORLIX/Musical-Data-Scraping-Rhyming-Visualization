------ Pierre & Anatole ------
--- Unknown ---
(During this scene, Natasha prepares to poison herself)
--- PIERRE ---
You promised Countless Rostova to marry her and were about to elope, is that so?
--- ANATOLE ---
Mon cher
I don't consider myself bound to answer questions put to me in that tone
--- PIERRE ---
My face, already pale
Becomes distorted by fury
I seize you by the collar with my big big hands
And I shake you from side to side
Until your face shows a sufficient degree of terror
When I tell you I must talk to you!
--- ANATOLE ---
Come now, this is stupid!
What what don't don't!
--- PIERRE ---
You're a scoundrel and a blackguard
And I don't know what deprives me of the pleasure
Of smashing your head in with this!
--- Unknown ---
(He takes a heavy paperweight and lifts it threateningly, but at once puts it back in its place)
--- Unknown ---
Did you promise to marry her?
--- ANATOLE ---
I didn't think of it. I never promised, because -
--- PIERRE ---
Have you any letters of hers?
Any letters?
--- Unknown ---
I shan't be violent, don't be afraid
--- Unknown ---
(Anatole hands Pierre a pack of letters)
--- Unknown ---
First, the letters
Second, tomorrow you must get out of Moscow
--- ANATOLE ---
But how can I?
--- PIERRE ---
Third
You must never breathe a word of what has happened between you and the Countess
Now I know I can't prevent your doing so
But if you have a spark of conscience
--- Unknown ---
Pierre paces the room several times in silence
--- ANATOLE ---
Anatole sits at a table frowning and biting his lips
--- PIERRE ---
After all, you must understand
That besides your pleasure
There is such a thing as other people, and their happiness and peace
And that you are ruining a whole life
For the sake of amusing yourself!
Amuse yourself with women like my wife
With them you're within your rights
But to promise a young girl to marry her
To deceive, to kidnap
Why don't you understand that that's as cruel as beating an old man or a child?
--- ANATOLE ---
Well I don't know about that, eh?
I don't know that and I don't want to
But you have used such words to me
'Scoundrel' and so on
Which as a man of honor I will not allow anyone to use
--- PIERRE ---
Is it satisfaction you want?
--- ANATOLE ---
You could at least take back your words, eh?
If you want me to do as you wish?
--- Unknown ---
(Natasha drinks the poison)
--- PIERRE ---
Fine I take them back, I take them back!
And I ask you to forgive me
And if you require money for your journey -
--- ANATOLE ---
Anatole smiled
The reflection of that base and cringing smile
Which Pierre knew so well in his wife
Revolted him
--- PIERRE ---
Oh, vile and heartless brood!
--- ANATOLE ---
Next day Anatole left
