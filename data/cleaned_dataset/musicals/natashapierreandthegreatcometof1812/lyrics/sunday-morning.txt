------ Sunday Morning ------
--- NATASHA ---
Has Andrey arrived?
Has Andrey arrived?
He has not arrived
He will never come
Or something will happen to me before he does
--- MARYA D. ---
Come to church dear
--- SONYA ---
Marya Dmitryevna likes Sundays and knows how to keep them
The whole house has been scrubbed and cleaned
Roast goose and suckling pig filled our noses with glee
We wear holiday dresses
Travel by troika to church
--- MARYA D. ---
God is everywhere
--- NATASHA ---
I suffer more now than before
The theater and Anatole
That man who aroused such terrible feelings
I don't understand
Have I broken faith with Andrey?
Am I guilty?
--- SONYA ---
After church, Marya left for Prince Bolkonsky's
--- MARYA D. ---
The rudeness of that man!
I'll straighten him out!
--- NATASHA ---
That terrible old Prince
--- SONYA ---
There, there Natasha
It's not your fault
Here, kiss me
--- NATASHA ---
I can't bear to think of it
I'll shut myself in my room
And try on new dresses
--- SONYA ---
And just after Marya left
There was a knock at the door
Natasha had just turned her head to the glass
