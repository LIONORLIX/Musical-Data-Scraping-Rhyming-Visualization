------ The Abduction ------
--- ANATOLE ---
Everyone raise a glass! Whoa!
--- Unknown ---
Well, comrades
We've had our fun
Lived, laughed and loved
Friends of my youth,
When shall we meet again?
I'm going abroad
--- Unknown ---
Goodbye my gypsy lovers
All my revels here are over
Well goodbye, Matryosha
Kiss me one last time, whoa
Remember me to Steshka
There, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Wish me luck my gypsy lovers
Now goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
--- ALL ---
Goodbye my gypsy lovers
All my revels here are over
Well goodbye, Matryosha
Kiss me one last time, whoa
Remember me to Steshka
There, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Wish me luck my gypsy lovers
Now goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
--- Unknown ---
Hurrah!
Smash the glasses on the floor!
Let's go! Let's go!
--- Unknown ---
(They start to leave.)
--- ANATOLE ---
No, wait, wait, wait!
Shut the door!
First we have to sit down!
That's the way
--- Unknown ---
It's a Russian custom
--- Unknown ---
(They shut the door and all sit down for a moment.)
--- Unknown ---
All right
--- Unknown ---
(They start to leave)
--- DOLOKHOV ---
Wait, wait, wait!
Where's the fur cloak?
--- Unknown ---
I have heard what elopements are like
She'll rush out more dead than alive
Just in the things she's wearing
If you delay at all, there'll be tears and 'Papa' and 'Mama'
And she's frozen in a minute and must go back
But you wrap the fur cloak round her
And you carry her to the sleigh
That's the way
That's the way
--- ALL ---
That's the way
That's the way
--- BALAGA ---
Let's get outta here!
And the troika tore down Nikitski Boulevard
Whoa! Giddyup, now! Whoa! Whoa!
--- ALL ---
Hey Balaga
Ho Balaga
Hey hey ho Balaga
Hey hey Balaga
The famous troika driver
--- Unknown ---
Hey Balaga
Ho Balaga
Hey hey ho Balaga
Hey hey Balaga
The famous troika driver
--- DOLOKHOV ---
When they reached the gate Dolokhov whistled
The whistle was answered, and a maidservant ran out
--- MAIDSERVANT ---
Come in through the courtyard or you'll be seen; she'll come out directly
--- DOLOKHOV ---
Dolokhov stayed by the gate
Anatole followed the maid into the courtyard
Turned the corner, ran up to the porch
--- Unknown ---
(Anatole is stopped by Marya D.)
--- MARYA D. ---
You will not enter my house, scoundrel!
--- DOLOKHOV ---
Anatole, come back!
Betrayed! Betrayed!
Betrayed, Anatole!
Come back!
Betrayed! Betrayed! Betrayed!
