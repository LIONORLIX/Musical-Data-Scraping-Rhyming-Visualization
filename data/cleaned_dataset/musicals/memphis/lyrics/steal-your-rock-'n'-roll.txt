------ Steal Your Rock 'N' Roll ------
--- HUEY ---
I listened to advice from folks smarter than me,
And I ignored it.
I listened to hatred from folks richer than me,
And I deplored it.
I listened to music from folks darker than me,
And you know I adored it!

First come's a point in everybody's life
When they gotta stand up and face a fight.
There comes a point in everybody's life,
When they gotta wonder if they done right.
I swallowed my fear, followed my heart right here,
And through it all one almighty thought stood clear-
Listen to the beat, listen to the beat
Play it, obey it, love it with, love it with your feet.
--- HUEY ---
Oooh oh oh
Listen to your soul, listen to your soul,
Heed it,
--- FELICIA ---
Heed it
--- HUEY ---
Ya need it
--- FELICIA ---
Ya need it,
--- HUEY ---
Let it make/ let it make you whole.
And if ya listen to the beat
And hear what's in your soul-
You'll never let anyone steal your rock 'n roll!
--- HUEY/FELICIA/COMPANY ---
Listen to the beat, listen to beat

And if ya listen to the beat and hear what's in your soul-
You'll never let anyone steal your rock 'n roll!
Listen to the beat and hear what's in your soul-
