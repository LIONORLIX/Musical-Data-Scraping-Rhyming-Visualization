------ Scratch My Itch ------
--- WAILIN' JOE ---
Woo! Come on, baby now, won't you scratch my itch!
You got me boiling at a burnin' fever pitch!
I tried some love cream, put some honey on it too!
But the only thing that can cure my itch is you!
--- COMPANY ---
Come on, scratch/scratch/scratch/scratch/scratch my itch!
Scratch/scratch/scratch/scratch/scratch my itch!
--- WAILIN' JOE ---
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, babe,
Baby, babe, you're givin' me a twitch,
So scratch my itch!
