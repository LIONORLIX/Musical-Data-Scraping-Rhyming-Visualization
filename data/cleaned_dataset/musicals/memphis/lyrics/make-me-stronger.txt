Pick me up, lift me higher,
Give me strength, I never had!
For I can't be weak, too much longer-
Oh Lord, Lord, Lord, make me stronger!
Oh Lord, Lord, Lord, make me stronger!

Oh Mama, listen to me,
They're too blind and they just can't see!
I'm buying you a home,
I swear right now, I swear right here,
I'm gonna make this poverty disappear!
I'm gonna make this poverty disappear!

Pick me up, lift me higher,
Give me strength I never had-
--- MAMA ---
All my life, I done what's proper.
And here we are, still poor as dirt.
Oh I just can't take this too much longer,
Oh Lord, Lord, Lord make me stronger!

Feel his love, feel his power,
Move a mountain, change the world!
For I can't be weak too much longer,
Oh Lord, Lord, Lord, make me stronger!
Feel his love, feel his power,
Move a mountain, change the world!
For I can't be weak too much longer,
Oh Lord, Lord, Lord, make me stronger!
