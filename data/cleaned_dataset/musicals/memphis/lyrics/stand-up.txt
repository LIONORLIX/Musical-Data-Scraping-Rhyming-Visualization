------ Stand Up ------
--- Unknown ---
You see that fool just standin' there.
He's as fool as a fool can be.
But that crazy fool is the man I love,
So that fool is comin' with me.
All of these years you've looked after me
And I thank you from deep down in my soul.
But today is the day I worked for all my life-
Step aside, yeah, I'm takin' control!
Unroll the red carpet, and uncork the champagne,
We're flyn' to New York on a big ol' areoplane!
It's time we stand up-
--- DELRAY ---
Stand up, and make New York hear our song.
--- FELICIA ---
Don't you know it's time to stand up-
--- HUEY ---
Stand up!
--- HUEY/FELICIA ---
Time to prove that we belong.
--- DELRAY ---
I'll get respect I never had, be a music makin' VIP!
--- HUEY ---
And I'll be the first to play that underground sound,
I'll rock and roll your black 'n white T.V.!
--- FELICIA ---
You're the man I love and the brother I need,
But ya both been gettin' on my nerve.
--- DELRAY ---
So we go up north,
--- HUEY ---
To where the Yankees live
--- TRIO ---
And live the life that we deserve!
--- BOBBY ---
Ol' Bobby Dupree, was just pushin' a broom!
Now I'm on your T.V., tearin' up the room!
I met me a girl and I make her go-
--- ALL ---
Wow!
--- ETHEL ---
He's my cool cat!
--- BOBBY ---
Ans she's the cat's meow!
--- GATOR/DANCERS ---
Now it's time we stand up! Stand up!
Make 'em all hear our song!
Don't you know it's time to stand up! Stand up!
Gonna prove that we belong!
We talkin' non-stop be-bop do-wop
Slipslopa, flip-flopa tip-top, baby!
Time to get down! Time to get down!
--- FELICIA/DANCERS ---
Stand up in the name of rock!
Gonna roll you with my song!
Can't ever let this music stop!
This train is rollin' on.
Don't you know it's time to stand up!
Make 'em all hear our song!
It's our time to stand up!
Gonna prove that we belong!
Don't you know it's time to stand up! I say it's time to stand up!
It's our time to stand up! Stand up!
It's our time to stand up! I say it's time to stand up!
Don't you know it's time to stand up! Stand up!
