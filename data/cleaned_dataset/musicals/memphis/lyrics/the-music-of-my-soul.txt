------ The Music of My Soul ------
--- HUEY ---
When I was a young boy my daddy sat me down,
He said Son, don't you never go to the dark side of town. I'm talkin' downtown Memphis, see that's where the black folk
play
An' I said Yes sir, Daddy, and then I snuck down anyway!
See, never was taught to read none, no, never taught to write.
The only thing my Daddy taught was white should stay with white.
But I heard it through the alleys, it floated on the breeze,
It burst out through the doorways and it knocked me to my knees!
It broke down all my senses, yet made me feel so whole,
See, I was lost until I found the music of my soul,
The music of my soul.
Then one day my Daddy died, and we laid him in his grave
And my Mama, she cried and cried and cried, and prayed that he'd be saved.
But all I felt was pity for he never understood-
How could people be so bad that make me feel so good?
It whipped right through my body, it grabbed me by my heart.
--- FELICIA ---
It shot up from my fingertips and tore me right apart!
--- HUEY AND FELICIA ---
It broke down all my senses, yet made me feel so whole
And I will love it till the day I die-
The music of my soul!
--- COMPANY ---
It broke down all my senses, yet made me feel so whole.
See, I was lost until I found, I was deaf until I heard-
--- HUEY ---
I'll make this world come around to
--- COMPANY ---
