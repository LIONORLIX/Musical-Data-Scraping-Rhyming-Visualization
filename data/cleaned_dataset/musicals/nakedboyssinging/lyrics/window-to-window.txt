------ Window to Window ------
--- Unknown ---
There you are again.
Passing by your window.
Will you look out and see me standing here?
Here I am again.
Standing at my window.
Will we play the same old game, so far, so near?
The accidental glance where we discover one another,
Then we'll make up an excuse to look again.
And finally, we fix our gaze from behind our windowsills,
Where we finally agree, we both like what we see.
And here we are again.
Slowly rising passion.
Will this be the night you beckon me to come to you?
--- Unknown ---
Cause if you send for me I will touch you and caress you.
And if you send for me I will tell you all the things I dream.
And how everything with you feels so right.
And make sweet love until the morning light.
--- Unknown ---
Here we go again.
Taking off our shirts.
And teasing with the way we slide our pants down.
And in our underwear,
How we stop and stare.
The things that we go through to let our guards down.
A connection that was made from window to window.
There's magic in that alone.
A moment by itself that can't be taken lightly.
At last, someone to call my own!
--- Unknown ---
And if you send for me, I will feel and kiss and hold you,
And if you send for me, I will share my beating heart,
Knowing everything with you will be alright,
And make sweet love until the morning light.
--- Unknown ---
I see the way you want me.
It's the way that I want you.
I want you. I want you. I want you.
--- Unknown ---
Please won't you send for me?
We can start our lifetime of caring.
Come on, send for me.
Take a risk. Be daring.
I know everything for us will turn out right.
--- Unknown ---
No, don't pull down the shade,
And don't turn out your light.
Let's end this silly game.
Don't lose sight.
Please, just one last peek.
I'm the one you seek.
