Six AM. The sun is gone and my eyes all droopy. I'm yawnin.
everybody's looking all mean and grim.
Why the hell do I come to the gym?
My eyes say no. My lips say no. My head says no.
But Willie says yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah.
You've gotta be a pumpy junkie boy
if you wanna be a humpy hunky boy.
And you've gotta be a pumpy junkie boy
if you wanna be a humpy hunky muscleman.
My muscles shake and I'm soaking wet.
And I'm just finishing my first set.
I look in the morror and I'm showing some pride.
Then a big boy comes and stands by my side.
I feel like a stick standing next to him.
Why the hell do I come to the gym?
Biceps say no. Triceps say no. My pecs say no.
But Willie says yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah.
You've gotta be a pumpy junkie boy
if you wanna be a humpy hunkie boy.
Then you gotta be a pumpy junkie boy
if you wanna be a humpy hunky muscleman.
Run on the treadmill. I'm outta air. Run in place and I get nowhere.
Pant and wheeze and growing dim.
Why the hell do i go to the gym?
My lungs say no. My legs say no. My heart says no.
But Willie says yeah.
It's true for you and it's true for me.
Gay mans got to be fat free.

Arch your back.
Turn. Pose. Head for the shower.
Slowly peel your sweaty clothes.
Pout, brood, sulk, scowl.
Slowly slip into a scimpy towel.
And as you step beneath the steamy spray.
Pretend you don't notice you're on display.
Keep on soaping, groping too.
Because everybody's secretly scoping you.

Fire. Steam. Like a sweaty dream.
The figure shift is straining your eyes.
Feel the tension rise and rise.
--- Unknown ---
Cruising. Floozing. Oozing.
And my arms say Aahh.
And my legs say Aahh.
And my back says Aahh.
and Willie?
Willie says hi. Hi.
Later? Yeah.
Romeo and Juliet it ain't.
So get out of the steamroom. (out of the steamroom, out of the steamroom)
Before you faint.

If god made his angels with his muscley grace.
Then heaven (heaven, heaven) must be a hot and sweaty place.

This may sound dumb and this may sound silly.
But I'm pretty sure I'm working out for Willie.
Getting big and buff should go.
Does it matter which head is in control?
Who cares if the little heads the one?
As long as you get your workout done.
Yes I'm doing it all for him.
Now I know why I go to the gym.
And Willie says yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah.
You gotta be a pumpy junkie boy
if you wanna be a humpy hunky boy.
You gotta be a pumpy junkie boy
