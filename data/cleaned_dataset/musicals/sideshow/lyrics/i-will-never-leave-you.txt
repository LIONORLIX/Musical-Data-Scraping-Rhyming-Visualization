------ I Will Never Leave You ------
--- Violet ---
What have we done?
--- Daisy ---
Learned the truth
--- Violet ---
Closed a door
--- Daisy ---
Opened more
--- Violet ---
I'm scared, Daisy
--- Daisy ---
Of what?
--- Violet ---
Being alone
--- Daisy ---
But you're not
You never have been
If we stood on our tiptoes
We could peek over the sill
And once in a while we would see a girl
Slowly walking up the hill
--- Violet ---
And we'd think what a sad situation
To be outside on your own
--- Daisy ---
To go through the town with no playmate
--- Violet ---
To go through life all alone
--- Daisy & Violet ---
I will never leave you
I will never go away
We were meant to share each moment
Beside you is where I will stay
Evermore and always
We'll be one though we're two
For I will never leave you
--- Daisy ---
When the day is filled with shadows
That stretch into the night
--- Violet ---
I am filled with your sweet comfort
Like morning fills with light
--- Daisy & Violet ---
I will never leave you
I will never go away
We were meant to share each moment
Beside you is where I will stay
Evermore and always
We'll be one though we're two
For I will never leave you
--- Daisy ---
No, I will never leave you
--- Violet ---
I will never leave you
--- Daisy & Violet ---
I will never go away
We were meant to share each moment
--- Daisy ---
Beside you is where I will stay
--- Violet ---
That's where I will stay
--- Daisy ---
Evermore and always
--- Violet ---
Evermore
--- Daisy & Violet ---
We'll be one though we're two
--- Daisy ---
One though we're two
--- Daisy & Violet ---
For I will never
I will never
I will never leave you
