------ When I'm By Your Side ------
--- Daisy & Violet ---
You are my favorite new playmate
I love the fun you provide
A song and a laugh
Are better by half
When I'm by your side
Happy to be your companion
Glad that I qualified
I feel as grand as the canyon
When I'm by your side
People stop dead when they've seen us
We take their staring in stride
Can't fit a needle between us
When I'm by your side
We're an unusual duo
Don't always swim with the tide
But who needs a boat?
I'm always afloat
When I'm by your side

They do a dance that Buddy taught to them...
--- Daisy & Violet ---
I like what I duo can do
The combination is greater
Than the sum of its parts
Should we cement this arrangement?
Now that it's tested and tried
We're such a tight weave
I don't want to leave
We make a matched set
A perfect duet
Like eggs on a ham
Like twins to Siam
I'm by your side

Their friends applaud wildly, but The Boss hears them...
--- The Boss ---
What the hell is all this racket?!
I might have known.
What are you all doing here?
--- Daisy ---
They came to hear us sing.
--- The Boss ---
Sing?
--- Violet ---
We can sing
We did sing
--- The Boss ---
You girls back to your trailer!
--- Daisy ---
Don't tell us what to do
--- The Boss ---
You girls are asking for it!
--- Violet ---
We're not asking for anything
--- Daisy ---
We're leaving the sideshow
--- The Boss ---
Well, we'll see about that.
Get out of my way, Jake!
Jake!
You get out of my way or you get out of this sideshow!
Have you all lost your minds?
I will fire the lot of you!
--- Jake ---
And put yourself on display?
--- The Boss ---
So this is the thanks I get?
Giving you food and shelter in this depression.
--- Roustabout #4 ---
Shelter?
--- Roustabout #3 ---
Ramshackled trailers
--- Roustabout #2 ---
Food?
Stale bread and slop
--- Roustabout #1 ---
And you charge us for those
Take it our of our pay
--- The Boss ---
I give you jobs!
--- Roustabout #3 ---
We do our jobs
You take the gates
--- Roustabout #1 ---
We hold our tounges
--- Roustabout #2 ---
While you berate and scorn
--- Roustabout #4 ---
And treat us wrong
--- All ---
We've had enough
We won't go on
You better change
Or we'll be gone
And leave you high and dry
--- Sheik ---
Or do you want to say goodbye?
--- All ---
Say goodbye to the freak show
To your singular source of dough
If you push too hard
While you hit too low
Say goodbye to the freak show
Goodbye
--- The Boss ---
I've spent a lifetime in sideshows
I can spot a con a mile away
When that snake in a suit sheds his skin
All they'll have is hell to pay
I'm one of you
And now our enterprise
Is less than before
So we need each other more
Down the road we've got a show to do
Tomorrow we play a new site
All of us could use some rest
So I will say goodnight
