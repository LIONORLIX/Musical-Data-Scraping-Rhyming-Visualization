------ Come Look At The Freaks ------
--- Company ---
Come look at the freaks
Come gape at the geeks
Come examine these aberrations
Their malformations
Grotesque physiques
Only pennies for peeks
Come look at the freaks
Come look at the freaks
They'll haunt you for weeks
Come explore why they fascinate you
Exasperate you
And flush your cheeks
Come hear how love speaks
Come look at the freaks
--- The Boss ---
Ladies and gentlemen
Step right up
Right this way
There is no wait
We don't waste your time
So little to pay
Just one thin dime
Gains you admission
To my odditorium
Never have you seen
A comparable emporium
Of wonders under one tent
Your dime could not be better spent
Come see a curious gal
The Bearded Lady
See a man
Turned into a reptile
As punishment for his sins
Come hear the haunting song
Of the Siamese twins
Come see our elegant geek
Refined but deadly
Chicken necks delight his incisors
Their heads decorate the mud
His favorite cocktail drink?
It's warm chicken blood!
From the barren desert
Of the heathen camel trade
For our gentlemen friends
The seraglio of a Hashemite sheik
His harem was freed
And we have found it quite unique
For these girls are virgins still
Had I arrived but an hour late
That old sheik would have had his fill
--- All ---
Come see God's mistakes
The freaks God forsakes
Take a look at the monster babies
Dog men with rabies
A bride of snakes
--- The Boss ---
And we don't harbor fakes
--- All ---
Come see God's mistakes
--- The Boss ---
From the inky jungles
Of the darkest continent
You will witness first hand
The ferocity of the Cannibal King
We keep him chained up
Because we know he's hankering
From a taste of one of you
And you are here for enlightenment
Not as stock for cannibal stew
Come look at the freaks
Come gape at the geeks
Come examine these aberrations
Their malformations
Grotesque physiques
Only pennies for peeks
--- Attractions ---
Come inside
Curiosity satisfied
Come!
See the underside
Inside!
--- The Boss ---
Won't you please forgive me
If I seem emotional
For the stars of our show
I am speaking of course
Of the Siamese twins
I adopted these girls
And gave them moral disciplines
Taught them standards
Right from wrong
I nurtured their musicality
Let them charm you with their song
--- Daisy & Violet ---
Ah, ah, ah...
--- The Boss ---
Ladies and gentlemen, step right up!
Right this way!
See the freaks!
They are here!
They are real
They are all alive!
Inside!
--- Buddy ---
This way, Mr. Conner.
Over here.
--- Terry ---
Where are we going?
--- Buddy ---
To a showing of the Siamese twins
--- Terry ---
Siamese twins?
--- Buddy ---
I want you to hear them sing
--- Terry ---
Siamese twins?
--- Buddy ---
We're just in time
Let's go inside
--- Terry ---
Is this some kind of joke?
--- Buddy ---
Not at all
--- Terry ---
Good.
Because I'm a very busy man
--- Buddy ---
You won't be disappointed
This could pay off big
For both of us
--- Terry ---
How?
--- Buddy ---
First you have to see them
--- Terry ---
I don't like this place.
--- Buddy ---
But we're here
We might as well stay
I'll even pay
--- Terry ---
Ok, I'll help you spend your hard earned dough
But this is not my kind of show
--- The Boss ---
Let me delay your fright
The attractions don't bite
Come inside
--- Unknown ---
The Boss takes Buddy and Terry into the sideshow tent and they
view the attractions - A sheik with 3 harem girls, a chicken-eating
geek, a fortune teller, a bearded lady, a fakir with a snake girl, a
reptile man, the odd 6th exhibit, Dolly Dimples, and the Cannibal King.
--- The Boss ---
Train the savage!
Ladies and gentlemen, there is no cause for alarm!
The Cannibal King has been subdued and is under our control!
There is nothing to fear!
Please remain in your seats!
To experience our premiere attraction in its most revealing display.
Scientists believe that Siamese twins come from the same life.
And that their complete separation was retarded in some way.
Perhaps while pregnant their mother
witnessed dogs stuck together copulating
They're called Siamese because Chang and Eng,
the first widely known specimans, came from Siam.
Siamese twins share everything.
Yet remain completely separate in their minds,
bodily functions and presumebly their souls.
But enough about science.
Sing girls, sing!
--- Daisy & Violet ---
Ah, ah, ah...
--- The Boss ---
Come look at the freaks
--- Attractions ---
Come inside
--- The Boss ---
Come gape at the geeks
--- Attractions ---
Curiosity satisfied
--- All ---
Come examine these aberrations
Their malformations
Grotesque physiques
Only pennies for peeks
Come look at the freaks!
--- Buddy ---
I'm dying to know what you think!
--- Terry ---
I'm intrigued.
--- Buddy ---
Great!
--- Terry ---
Why did you bring me here?
--- Buddy ---
Those twins
They have something
--- Terry ---
Something I'll never forget
--- Buddy ---
I can help them create an act
And you could get them to vaudeville
--- Terry ---
What kind of act?
--- Buddy ---
Singing Siamese twins
--- Terry ---
You call that singing?
--- Buddy ---
Not exactly, but I could teach them.
Look what I did with the Nubian Nightengale.
--- Terry ---
She needed help.
--- Buddy ---
I could really help the girls
Teach them to sing
Maybe to dance
--- Terry ---
Dance? Boy, you sure don't lack confidence.
--- Buddy ---
I like a challenge.
You wouldn't believe some of the acts I've helped.
--- Terry ---
Yeah, I know.
You're very ambitious, for an usher.
--- Buddy ---
But I can do a lot more
And you can give me my break
--- Terry ---
But those twins!
--- Buddy ---
Exactly
--- Terry ---
Well I have to admit
There's something those girls
--- Buddy ---
Let's meet them.
--- Terry ---
Ok.
--- Buddy ---
Great!
But there is one problem.
--- Terry ---
One?
--- Buddy ---
The owner.
He keeps them under lock and key.
--- Terry ---
Leave him to me.
--- Buddy ---
Gladly.
--- Terry ---
And if we get to meet them, let me do the talking.
--- Buddy ---
Whatever you say
--- The Boss ---
That was our last show today
But would you gentlemen like to see more?
--- Terry ---
More?
--- The Boss ---
More of the Siamese twins
They might be convinced to display their connection
Up close and private for a small consideration
--- Terry ---
Consideration?
--- The Boss ---
Two bucks for ten minutes
Total exposure of the fleshy link
No touching.
You're in for the experience of a lifetime
Right this way.
--- Unknown ---
Meanwhile, the sideshow attractions celebrate the twins birthday...
--- Geek ---
Attention
Ladies and gentlemen
Your attention please
The Cannibal King
Who, being the only royalty around
--- Bearded Lady ---
Says who?
--- Geek ---
His poster!
His billing says he's a king.
--- Bearded Lady ---
Mine says I'm a lady.
--- Reptile Man ---
Well they have to call you something.
--- Geek ---
As I was saying...
The Cannibal King wishes to make a proclamation
All Hail the Cannibal King
--- Jake ---
I, being the only available king
Hereby declare today a holiday
To honor the most beautiful maidens in the land
On the birthday they share
Along with everything else
Including our love
--- All ---
Happy birthday to you and to you
Here's a big happy birthday times two
Happy birthday from the whole damned crew
Happy birthday to you and to you
--- Boss ---
Ok, ok, party's over.
The twins have a private appointment
--- Geek ---
But it's their birthday!
--- The Boss ---
Says who?
--- Fortune Teller ---
We've always had a little celebration...
--- The Boss ---
I'm trying to run a business here!
We've got a customer who wants a private show
And the customer's always right
The rest of you out of my sight!
--- Jake ---
Boss, the day's receipts are in the tin
And I got you a brand new bottle of gin
--- The Boss ---
Good. You stay here Jake.
Mister, you've got ten minutes!
--- Daisy ---
Happy birthday.
--- Violet ---
Happy birthday.
--- Terry ---
Wait.
You don't have to show me anything, I just want to talk.
--- Jake ---
You made a deal to look, not talk.
--- Terry ---
Here, I'll give you all the cash I've got on me.
--- Jake ---
Mister, I like money as much as anybody
But in this depression, I like my job even more
--- Terry ---
They have nothing to fear from me.
--- Jake ---
Good.
Because even more than my job
I like these girls
--- Terry ---
Well then you'll like what I can do for them.
I only want a few minutes of private conversation.
--- Jake ---
If the boss come back...
--- Terry ---
Over there.
You can keep an eye out for him and
an eye on me at the same time.
--- Daisy ---
He seems ok, Jake
--- Violet ---
You'll be near by
--- Jake ---
I don't like this
--- Violet ---
For me, Jake?
--- Jake ---
I can't say no to you
--- Daisy ---
Who are you?
--- Terry ---
Name's Terry Connor
I have business to discuss
--- Violet ---
Are you sure you mean with us?
--- Terry ---
Yes.
And let me assure you I have honorable aims
But first, what are your names?
--- Daisy ---
I'm Daisy
--- Violet ---
I'm Violet
--- Daisy & Violet ---
We're Siamese Twins
--- Terry ---
So I've noticed. What's that like?
--- Daisy ---
What's it like being handsome?
--- Violet ---
Stop it, you're being rude!
--- Daisy ---
Am not!
--- Terry ---
I was rude to ask.
--- Violet ---
Everyone does.
--- Terry ---
But you must be very similar, right?
I'm sorry, which one is who?
--- Daisy ---
I'm Daisy
--- Violet ---
I'm Violet
--- Daisy & Violet ---
We're nothing alike
--- Violet ---
I'm to your right as you watch our show
--- Daisy ---
She thinks she's always right
Not so
I'm Daisy
--- Violet ---
I'm Violet
--- Daisy & Violet ---
What else would you like to know
--- Terry ---
Who makes the most decisions?
--- Daisy ---
I do.
--- Violet ---
I do.
--- Daisy and Violet ---
We both make our own decisions
--- Terry ---
There must be times you don't agree
--- Daisy ---
Not me
--- Violet ---
Not me
--- Terry ---
Or times you want to be alone?
--- Violet ---
Then we close a door inside and hide
--- Terry ---
Where?
--- Violet ---
In a secret place we know
Where nobody else can go
--- Terry ---
How?
--- Daisy ---
Haven't you ever been in conversation
And your mind drifted somewhere else?
--- Violet ---
Or been in a room surrounded by people
And yet, felt a million miles away?
--- Terry ---
I guess I have.
--- Daisy ---
Well, that's where we go
When we want to be alone
--- Violet ---
We could go there right now
If you wanted us to
--- Daisy ---
But we'd rather stay with you
--- Terry ---
I was taken by your singing
You have talent
Potential to do much more
--- Daisy ---
But we're freaks.
--- Terry ---
You are unusual
Exotic, different, unique
But my time's almost up
So will you allow one question more?
What are your dreams?
