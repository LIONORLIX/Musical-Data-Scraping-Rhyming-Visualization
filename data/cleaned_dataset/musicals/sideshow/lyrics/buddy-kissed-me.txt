------ Buddy Kissed Me ------
--- Unknown ---
Violet
Buddy kissed me
He kissed me for the first time
--- Unknown ---
Daisy
Didn't you hear what he said?
--- Unknown ---
Violet
There's only one thought
Running through my head
He kissed me
--- Unknown ---
Daisy
And then they both denied
Any thought of romance
--- Unknown ---
Violet
But he kissed me
Words can lie
But kisses don't
--- Unknown ---
Daisy
You can lie to yourself
I won't
No one could love a Siamese twin
Nobody wants us
No one ever has
No one ever will
--- Unknown ---
Violet
Why are you trying
To kill my dream?
--- Unknown ---
Daisy
It's not a dream
It's a nightmare
Wake up
Look around you
We are freaks
Stuck together
And we'll always be alone
--- Unknown ---
Violet
But I want to wake up
To what I'm dreaming of
Dreaming that some day
Some night
I could find love
