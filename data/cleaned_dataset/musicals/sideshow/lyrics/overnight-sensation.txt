------ Overnight Sensation ------
--- Terry ---
Thank you, my friends
From the fourth estate
For coming tonight
--- Reporter ---
This better be good
Because vaudeville is fading
--- Reporter ---
Our readers have more interest
In pictures than talk
--- Reporter ---
Give the man a chance, guys
He always comes through
--- Reporter ---
His stories are great
And some of them are true
--- Terry ---
Have I ever lied to you?
--- All Reporters ---
Well, maybe not lied
Exaggerated here and there
--- Terry ---
I'm giving you the chance to jump the gun
And run this story in your publications
Of these double duty sensations
--- Reporter ---
Double Duty?
--- Reporter ---
What the hell are they?
--- Terry ---
They are Daisy and Violet Hilton
The most talented, lovely
And charming of heroines
Who happen to be Siamese twins
--- Reporter ---
Siamese twins?
--- Reporter ---
Terry, have you sunk so low?
--- Reporter ---
You need clients from the freak show
--- Terry ---
No, no, no!
My clients will be
An overnight sensation
Wait till you see them on stage
Wait till your doubt
Turns into fascination
Their story will leap off the page
You'll engage
In manic speculation
About this overnight sensation
--- Unknown ---
The reporters leave and the twins are in the middle of a photo shoot...
--- Buddy ---
Violet, don't be afraid of the camera
Just relax
--- Violet ---
I don't know how
--- Buddy ---
Look into the camera
Like you're looking in the eyes
Of the one you love
--- Daisy ---
That shouldn't be too hard
--- Violet ---
Watch it, Daisy
--- Daisy ---
I love the camera
I feel like a movie star
What do you think, Terry?
Could I be a goddess of the silver screen?
--- Terry ---
After tonight, the world's your oyster
You're gonna be an overnight sensation
I brought the press and their primed
Talk of the town
And then talk of the nation
After the hurdles we've climbed
We have timed
This evening's presentation
To make on overnight sensation
--- Buddy ---
And after your act tonight
When your interview's through
We've got a surprise
A room with a view
--- Terry ---
To host our triumphant two
The finest hotel
--- Buddy ---
It'll be swell
Like you
--- Terry ---
You're gonna be an overnight
--- Buddy ---
Overnight
--- Buddy & Terry ---
You're gonna be an overnight sensation
--- Buddy ---
