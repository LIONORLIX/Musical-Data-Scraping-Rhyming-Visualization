------ Crazy, Deaf and Blind ------
--- The Boss ---
Stop!
Can I ask you a question?
--- Terry ---
Of course.
--- The Boss ---
Are you deaf?
--- Terry ---
No.
--- The Boss ---
If you think these girls are singers
Then you must be hard of hearing
They do a little yowling
Dogs baying at the moon
But the sound they make is screeching
And you're really overreaching
If you think these lousy honkers could ever learn a tune
One more question
Are you blind?
Is that why you didn't notice
That these two are joined together?
With a little flesh between them
Making it impossible to go in two directions
Or into different sections of the room
I don't know what weird perversion
Makes you find these dregs a sight
But I protect them from vermin like you
So let me save your breath and my valuable time
They are freaks
They are monsters
They will never leave the sideshow
And there are other play things
That I'm sure that you can find
So why don't you start looking through the slime and muck
Get in it
I can't spend another minute
With someone crazy, deaf and blind
--- Terry ---
I appologize.
I'm sorry to intrude.
--- Daisy ---
No, please don't go!
--- The Boss ---
You shut your mouth!
--- Terry ---
I didn't mean to cause you any trouble.
--- The Boss ---
Well, you have.
Jake will show you off the grounds.
--- Terry ---
So lovely to meet you, ladies.
--- Daisy ---
Lovely
--- Violet ---
Goodbye
--- The Boss ---
Jake, you make sure he gets gone.
You girls, out of my sight.
--- Unknown ---
The Boss leaves, but Buddy and Terry stay...
--- Terry ---
I'm right, aren't I, Jake?
They can sing.
--- Jake ---
Yes, they can
--- Terry ---
Help me prove that
--- Violet ---
Help us, Jake
--- Daisy ---
Give us a chance to learn
--- Jake ---
You girls will be the death of me
You heard the Boss
--- Violet ---
Oh, what does he know
--- Daisy ---
He's a mean, old drunk
--- Terry ---
We can change his tune
--- Daisy ---
Please, Jake
--- Violet ---
We'll be very careful
--- Daisy ---
He doesn't need to know
--- Violet ---
For me, Jake?
--- Jake ---
I can't say no to you
--- Terry ---
Good man.
So Buddy will teach you girls a song.
--- Daisy ---
Oh, I'm a quick learner!
--- Terry ---
Great!
My kind of girl
--- Violet ---
I'm afraid you'll have your work cut out with me
--- Buddy ---
All you need is a little help
--- Violet ---
What if I can't do that?
--- Buddy ---
I know you can
--- Terry ---
There's no pressure.
Just sing a song for us,
and maybe some of your friends.
Buddy will meet you here tomorrow night.
--- Violet ---
What about the Boss?
--- Jake ---
I'll take care of him
--- Daisy ---
We're very grateful, Jake
Will you be here tomorrow night, Mr. Connor
--- Terry ---
Call me Terry
And I'll be back in a couple of weeks
But I'll be thinking of you while I'm gone
Now will you girls work very hard
And do as we tell you?
--- Violet ---
Oh yes, we will
--- Daisy ---
Anything you say
--- Terry ---
Say goodbye to the freak show
Let me show you a place I know
--- Buddy ---
Where only daisys and violets grow
--- Buddy & Terry ---
Say goodbye to the freak show
Goodbye
--- Unknown ---
Buddy and Terry leave...
--- Daisy ---
What brought him here
That handsome guy?
--- Violet ---
I wonder what
I wonder why
--- Daisy ---
Do you think he could make our dreams come true?
--- Violet ---
He sure would have a lot of work to do
--- Fortune Teller ---
He's the one to do it
I can see it all
See it in my crystal ball
--- Daisy ---
Oh, you heard what he said?
--- Fortune Teller ---
Every word.
--- Roustabout #4 ---
We all did.
--- Bearded Lady ---
Daisy and Violet, please don't go with them
--- 6th Exhibit ---
No, give them a try
--- Daisy ---
We already agreed to
--- Violet ---
Agreed to learn a song
Not to leave you
--- Bearded Lady ---
Not yet
We heard what they said
Say goodbye to the freak show
--- Violet ---
I would never do that
--- Daisy ---
I would
But not because I want to leave you
But to play vaudeville
To make something of our lives
--- Sheik ---
This life isn't good enough for you
--- Roustabout #4 ---
You call this a life?
--- Geek ---
I call this the only home the girls have ever known
--- Fakir ---
Predators will target them out there on their own
--- Harem Girl #3 ---
Well, I think they should go
--- Jake ---
That's enough
This is not about any of us
