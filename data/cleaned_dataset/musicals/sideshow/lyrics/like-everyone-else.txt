------ Like Everyone Else ------
--- Violet ---
I want to be like everyone else
So no one will point and stare
To walk down the street not attracting attention
No notice, no mention, no hint of dispare
A normal reaction
A standard response
The same as everyone wants
--- Daisy ---
I want to be like everyone else
But richer and more acclaimed
Worshiped and celebrated
Pampered and loved
To see those who've laughed
Feeling ashamed
A glorious frantic
Adoring response
The same as everyone wants
I'd go abroad
See all the sights
Hear folks applaud
Bow to the lights
--- Violet ---
I'd settle down
Never to roam
Find a nice husband and home
--- Daisy ---
I want to be
--- Violet ---
I want to be
--- Daisy & Violet ---
Like everyone else
But not like my sister says
--- Daisy ---
She wants stability
--- Violet ---
She would like fame
I'd like serenity
--- Daisy ---
Frenzied acclaim
--- Daisy & Violet ---
Though we can't agree on a single response
We want what everyone wants
Only what everyone wants
The same as everyone wants
--- Jake ---
Ok, time's up!
Mister, you better get outta here
--- Daisy ---
No, don't make him go
--- Jake ---
If the boss comes back
--- Terry ---
Go get him. I'd like to talk to him.
--- Jake ---
You don't know what you're getting into.
--- Terry ---
I always know
--- Violet ---
Please, Jake
--- Jake ---
You two are gonna loose me my job
--- Daisy ---
This is fun!
Anymore questions?
--- Terry ---
Not right now.
--- Violet ---
Then can we ask you one?
--- Terry ---
Of course.
--- Daisy & Violet ---
Why are you here?
--- Terry ---
Well, I admit I never expected to be,
but a certain you man insisted I see you.
Buddy, come here.
This is Buddy Foster, a very talented musician.
--- Buddy ---
I sing, too.
--- Terry ---
Yes, he does.
--- Buddy ---
And dance.
--- Terry ---
All of that.
Skip the resume.
