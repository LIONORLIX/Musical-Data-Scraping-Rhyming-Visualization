------ The Interview ------
--- Buddy ---
I knew they were meant to sing
But tonight they did more
--- Jake ---
Did you hear that crowd?
They hollered so loud
I bet their throats are sore
--- Buddy ---
This isn't a dream
Did you hear them scream
'Encore'
--- Buddy & Jake ---
You're gonna be an overnight
--- Terry ---
Overnight
--- Buddy, Jake, Terry ---
You're gonna be an overnight sensation
--- Terry ---
Magnificent!
--- Buddy ---
Wonderful!
--- Violet ---
I actually enjoyed myself
--- Buddy ---
Oh Violet, I'm so happy to hear that
--- Daisy ---
If we always get kisses
I'll try even harder
--- Terry ---
Kisses are a tiny reward
--- Violet ---
Not for us
--- Buddy ---
Then get ready for another
--- Terry ---
And another
--- Buddy ---
And another
--- Buddy & Terry ---
Here's to a wonderful show
--- Unknown ---
The reporters enter to meet the twins...
--- Reporters ---
Where can we meet this overnight sensation?
When can we talk to the stars?
We want the facts
Without exaggeration
This story will win us cigars
Certain bars
Await our visitation
To toast this overnight sensation
--- Terry ---
Gentlemen - The Hilton sisters
--- Reporters ---
We've got a million questions for you
--- Reporter ---
Would you start by reminding us
Which one is who
--- Daisy ---
I'm Daisy
--- Violet ---
I'm Violet
--- Daisy & Violet ---
We're Siamese twins
--- Violet ---
I'm to your right
As you watch our show
--- Daisy ---
She thinks she's always right
Not so
I'm Daisy
--- Violet ---
I'm Violet
--- Daisy & Violet ---
What else would you like to know?
--- Reporter ---
Could you be separated?
--- Reporter ---
Have doctors examined you?
--- Daisy ---
In hundreds of ways
--- Violet ---
From our earliest days
--- Daisy ---
Some think we could be separated
--- Violet ---
Some would love to try
--- Daisy & Violet ---
Some think we would die
--- Reporter ---
How do you sleep?
--- Daisy & Violet ---
In a bed
--- Reporter ---
But does one ever keep the other awake?
--- Daisy ---
Well, it does take a bit of doing
--- Violet ---
If one of us wants to roll over
--- Daisy & Violet ---
But whose life is a bed of clovers
--- Terry ---
Certainly not yours.
--- Reporter ---
What about romance?
--- Reporter ---
What about love?
--- Reporter ---
What about those?
--- Violet ---
Oh, those
I suppose it's bound to happen
--- Daisy ---
Someday
--- Violet ---
Some night
When the moon is just right
--- Daisy ---
When the universe hums
--- Violet ---
When the guy comes along
Who hears the singer more than the song
--- Daisy ---
Someday
--- Violet ---
Some night
--- Daisy & Violet ---
Love will feel right
--- Unknown ---
Daisy and Violet's thoughts leave the room for a moment...
--- Violet ---
Buddy kissed me
He kissed me for the first time
--- Daisy ---
I forced a kiss before the show
But not the kisses that followed
--- Violet ---
The lips prove we're sharing
The warmth that I felt
The frost on my heart
Is beginning to melt
--- Daisy ---
You can't minimize
The heat in your eyes
Your passion is not a surprise
--- Unknown ---
They continue with the interview...
--- Reporter ---
You're working with several men.
--- Reporter ---
Like Terry.
--- Reporter ---
That Foster kid.
--- Reporter ---
The colored guy.
--- Reporter ---
How close are all of you?
--- Reporter ---
Very close?
--- Violet ---
We wouldn't be here without their help
--- Daisy ---
We share the applause with them
--- Reporter ---
Anything else?
--- Reporter ---
Your room?
--- Reporter ---
Your bed?
--- Terry ---
Not to pour cold water on your sick fantasizing,
But this is business.
There's no romance involved.
--- Buddy ---
We'd never take advantage of these girls
--- Terry ---
The suggestion is absurd.
I have a sweetheart at home
--- Reporter ---
Not only there, so I've heard
--- Reporter ---
So none of you have interest
In a double-header?
--- Jake ---
No one talks to them that way!
--- Terry ---
All right, Jake.
I'll handle this.
--- Unknown ---
Daisy and Violet go back to their thoughts...
--- Violet ---
I'm not really here
Nothing they're saying is catching my ear
And I'm virtually blind
No more room in my mind
He kissed me
--- Daisy ---
One minute bliss
Because of his kiss
Then crippling doubt
When the truth comes out
All that I felt was a lie
--- Violet ---
I felt love within you
--- Daisy ---
How can we continue?
--- Violet ---
The seeds we have planted will bloom
--- Daisy ---
Enough of these questions
--- Violet ---
I can't hear the questions
--- Daisy & Violet ---
I can't keep my mind in the room
--- Unknown ---
Back to the interview...
--- Reporter ---
Don't you need a man?
--- Reporter ---
Don't you want to get married?
--- Reporters ---
Husbands?
Children?
Families?
--- Reporter ---
Don't you feel like nuns?
--- Reporter ---
Will you always be virgins?
--- Reporters ---
Always spinsters?
Barren?
--- Violet ---
Like any girls our age
We dream of getting married
A wedding
--- Daisy ---
A husband
--- Violet ---
A family to come home to
--- Reporters ---
How would that work?
With your condition
--- Daisy ---
Anything's possible
--- Violet ---
When everything's right
--- Daisy ---
I'm Daisy
--- Violet ---
I'm Violet
--- Terry ---
Goodnight
--- Unknown ---
Buddy, Jake, Terry and the reporters leave Daisy and Violet alone
--- Violet ---
Buddy kissed me
He kissed me for the first time
--- Daisy ---
Didn't you hear what he said?
--- Violet ---
There's only one thought
Running through my head
He kissed me
--- Daisy ---
And then they both denied
Any thought of romance
--- Violet ---
But he kissed me
Words can lie
But kisses don't
--- Daisy ---
You can lie to yourself
I won't
No one could love a Siamese twin
Nobody wants us
No one ever has
No one ever will
--- Violet ---
Why are you trying to kill my dream?
--- Daisy ---
It's not a dream
It's a nightmare
Wake up
Look around you
We are freaks
Stuck together
And we'll always be alone
--- Violet ---
But I want to wake up to what I'm dreaming of
Dreaming that some day
Some night
I could find love
