------ One Plus One Equals Three ------
--- Buddy ---
I never sought the spotlight
I stayed behind the scenes
But then I met a sweetheart
Who changed my old routines
She put me in the spotlight
Now I'm a happy pup
And when I count my blessings
I find they all add up to
One plus one equals three
My baby, her sister and me
This is not what I expected
But my baby is well-connected
You can see why I elected
This arithmetic with an odd key
Where one plus one equals three
Some guys wonder how it'll work
Some women titter and smirk
All their questions will be resolved
I've got the problem solved
'Cause one plus one
One plus one
One plus one
--- Daisy & Violet ---
We've always been a duo
--- Daisy ---
A twosome who's compact
--- Daisy & Violet ---
But we're happy to welcome
--- Violet ---
An addition to our act
--- Daisy ---
He's Violet's intended
--- Buddy ---
I'm the lucky one
--- Violet ---
I'm the one who's lucky
--- Buddy, Daisy, Violet ---
Ain't we having fun
--- Buddy ---
We're planning a big wedding
For each and every friend
Consider this your invitation
--- Daisy & Violet ---
Hope you will attend
--- Buddy, Daisy, Violet ---
Big day will be coming up soon
Big wedding
--- Buddy & Violet ---
Small honeymoon
--- Buddy, Daisy, Violet ---
For the moment
We thought we'd do
This preview just for you
--- Vale Sisters ---
Ooo-ooo-ooo
Ooo-ooo-ooo
Ooo-ooo-ooo
--- Daisy, Violet, Vale Sisters ---
Hey there, professor
Won't you answer, yes sir
How's about a lesson in your new kind of math
--- Buddy ---
Well, one plus one equals
--- Daisy, Violet, Vale Sisters ---
That's gonna be
Gonna be three
--- Violet ---
His baby
--- Daisy ---
Her sister
--- Buddy ---
And don't forget me
--- Vale Sisters ---
With a little persuasion
How hap-hap-hap-hap-happy we'll be
When one plus one
--- Daisy, Violet, Vale Sisters ---
Plus one
--- Buddy ---
One plus one
--- Daisy, Violet, Vale Sisters ---
What fun
--- Buddy ---
One plus one
Means my baby
--- Violet ---
I'm his baby
--- Vale Sisters ---
His baby
--- Buddy ---
Her sister
--- Daisy ---
I'm his baby's sister
--- Vale Sisters ---
His baby's sister and
--- Buddy ---
And me
--- Vale Sisters ---
That equals
--- Violet ---
And me
--- Vale Sisters ---
That equals
--- Daisy ---
And me
--- Vale Sisters ---
That equals
--- Buddy, Daisy, Violet, Vale Sisters ---
Equals three
--- Unknown ---
The song ends, and everyone gets ready to leave...
--- Violet ---
Buddy, you're a wonderful performer
You've become the star I knew you'd be
--- Buddy ---
You give me confidence out there
--- Violet ---
You get so nervous before the show
You remind me of me
--- Terry ---
Good work, everyone!
Now I am expecting a phone call up in the office
And then I'm taking us all to dinner.
--- Buddy ---
I'll come with you.
--- Unknown ---
Buddy and Terry leave...
--- Violet ---
Before long you'll be getting married,
And I'll be the bridesmaid.
--- Daisy ---
Don't hold your breath.
I'm not feeling well, I want to go home.
--- Violet ---
Anything I can do?
--- Daisy ---
I don't think so.
--- Violet ---
Jake, could you tell Terry and Buddy to go ahead without us?
We'll wait here for you.
--- Unknown ---
Jake goes to tell Terry and Buddy, but overhears their conversation...
--- Buddy ---
I need to talk to you.
--- Terry ---
Is something wrong?
--- Buddy ---
I'm worried about Daisy
The questions people ask
She's bound to feel left out
--- Terry ---
She's getting more attention then ever
--- Buddy ---
But Violet's the focus
--- Terry ---
They're used to sharing
--- Buddy ---
But how about that double wedding?
--- Terry ---
Will you stop with that?
I could never marry a Siamese twin
--- Buddy ---
I don't see her as a Siamese twin
I got over that long ago
--- Terry ---
You're a better man than I
--- Buddy ---
Now I'm making her dream come true
And that makes me happy
--- Terry ---
Not to mention famous
--- Buddy ---
An unexpected benefit
Which I admit, I really like
--- Terry ---
You know, she really loves you
--- Buddy ---
And I love her
--- Terry ---
Is it love
Or pity?
Whatever your reason for proposing, there is a lot riding on this wedding.
And nothing's gonna stop it.
Not Daisy, not Violet, not you.
--- Buddy ---
This is my chance to do something important
To be remembered
To make a big splash
--- Terry ---
Then I'm depending on you to keep this on track
Keep playing your part
Keep Violet content
Keep the happy couple happy
--- Buddy ---
That's not a problem
But Daisy could be
--- Terry ---
I'll take care of her
--- Buddy ---
On the honeymoon?
--- Unknown ---
Terry leaves...
--- Buddy ---
You act like you know what's behind every door
I only hope that I'm not getting more
Than I bargained for
--- Unknown ---
Daisy and Violet wait for Jake to return...
--- Violet ---
Oh, Daisy, how can I make this easier for you?
--- Daisy ---
You can't
I can barely get through the songs
How will I get through your wedding?
Or honeymoon?
--- Violet ---
You will close a door inside
--- Daisy ---
I can't
When Buddy holds your hand
I tingle all over
When he pecks you on the cheek
I feel it on mine
--- Violet ---
We have always learned to adjust
We can learn
--- Daisy ---
You're the bride
You'll be preoccupied
--- Violet ---
If I were you
--- Daisy ---
You're not
--- Violet ---
You're just jealous
--- Daisy ---
Of course I am
--- Unknown ---
Jake enters...
--- Jake ---
There's nothing to be jealous about
--- Violet ---
What do you mean?
--- Jake ---
Don't go through with this wedding
--- Violet ---
Jake, what's gotten into you?
--- Jake ---
I feel things
I know things
--- Violet ---
So do I
Buddy will make me happy
--- Jake ---
I want your happiness more than anything
But I don't trust this
--- Violet ---
What do you know about it?
--- Jake ---
I know plenty
I know how someone should love you
--- Violet ---
