------ Who Will Love Me As I Am? ------
--- Violet ---
Like a fish plucked from the ocean
Tossed into a foreign stream
Always knew that I was different
Often fled into a dream
I ignored the raging current
Right against the tide I swam
But I floated with the question
Who will love me as I am?
--- Daisy ---
Like an odd exotic creature
On display inside a zoo
Hearing children asking questions
Makes me ask some questions too
Could we bend the laws of nature?
Could a lion love a lamb?
Who could see beyond this surface?
Who will love me as I am?
--- Daisy & Violet ---
Who will ever call to say I love you?
Send me flowers or a telegram?
Who could proudly stand beside me?
Who will love me as I am?
--- Daisy ---
Like a clown whose tears cause laughter
Trapped inside the center ring
--- Violet ---
Even seeing smiling faces
I am lonely pondering
--- Daisy & Violet ---
Who would want to join this madness?
Who would change my monogram?
Who will be part of my circus?
Who will love me as I am?
Who will ever call to say I love you?
Send me flowers or a telegram?
Who could proudly stand beside me?
Who will love me as I am?
--- Company ---
Who could proudly stand beside me?
