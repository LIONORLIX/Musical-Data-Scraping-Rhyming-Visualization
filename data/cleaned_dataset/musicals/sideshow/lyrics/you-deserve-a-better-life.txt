------ You Deserve a Better Life ------
--- Buddy ---
When I happened upon this sideshow
I said, 'They need a more dignified show'
I felt the way you were presented
Was completely wrong
And when I heard your voices
I said, 'They need a song'
You deserve a better life
No more worry
No more strife
For you possess a gift to cherish
In this jungle you could perish
We'll cut through it like a knife
You deserve a better life
--- The Boss ---
You should be long gone.
That was our deal.
--- Terry ---
I'd like to make you a new and better one.
I'm impressed by your operation
And let me say
My appreciation of your hard work
And business know-how
Comes from years myself
In low brow situations
Trying to make a buck
--- The Boss ---
Low brow?
--- Terry ---
You deserve a better life
No more worry
No more strife
For you possess a gift to cherish
In this jungle they could perish
I'll cut through it like a knife
You deserve a better life
I could make you a lot of money.
--- The Boss ---
How?
--- Terry ---
I'm a talent scout and a press agent
from the Orpheum Circuit
Your girls could play vaudeville.
--- Daisy ---
Vaudeville?!
--- The Boss ---
They're freaks.
--- Terry ---
But they sing.
--- The Boss ---
Caterwauling.
--- Terry ---
Let me work with them.
--- Daisy ---
Oh, please let us!
--- Violet ---
Maybe we could learn something
--- Terry ---
This fellow here,
He's very good at teaching how to sing.
