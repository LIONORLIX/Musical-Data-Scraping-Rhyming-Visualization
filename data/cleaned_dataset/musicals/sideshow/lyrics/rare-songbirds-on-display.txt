------ Rare Songbirds On Display ------
--- Daisy & Violet ---
We're singing sweet bird songs of love
As we float and flutter above
And each little sparrow and dove
Wants to play
Our love songs are music for mating
But these little lovebirds are waiting
Will someone find us captivating prey?
--- Daisy, Violet, Company ---
Till that day
They're songbirds on display
--- Company ---
Two birds in flight
Delighting far above the fray
They're winging
They're singing
They're bringing melodies our way
Ah - what a feather spray
Rare songbirds on display
--- Buddy ---
Good show, you two!
--- Violet ---
Remember when the compliments came with kisses?
--- Daisy ---
Not anymore
People might talk
--- Violet ---
Imagine what they'd say
--- Buddy ---
That's not fair
The tabloids keep trying to link you to us
Why add fuel to the fire?
--- Daisy ---
Why not?
They write whatever they want
--- Violet ---
God forbid they should mention you in connection with us
--- Buddy ---
Violet, nothing makes me prouder than working with you
And you know it
--- Violet ---
Sometimes I do
--- Jake ---
Let's get cracking, you two
We're gonna be late for the party
--- Buddy ---
What an exciting night
New York's society coming to meet you
--- Daisy ---
I can't wait
--- Violet ---
I can
--- Daisy ---
Being the toast of the town
Is such a hardship for her
--- Violet ---
People point and stare
--- Buddy ---
But this crowd does it with flair
--- Daisy ---
And we've got beautiful gowns to wear
--- Jake ---
Wait till you see them
Take it from a cannibal
Good enough to eat
--- Violet ---
You're very sweet
But stop fussing over me
--- Daisy ---
We want you to have fun
--- Buddy ---
I'll see to that
--- Jake ---
So will I
--- Violet ---
All right, I'll try
--- Buddy ---
That's all we ask.
Now hurry up and change, you two
--- Unknown ---
Daisy and Violet leave to get ready for the party...
--- Buddy ---
Does Violet seem unhappy to you?
--- Jake ---
Maybe so
--- Buddy ---
Do you know why?
--- Jake ---
Maybe so
--- Buddy ---
You know I'd do anything to help her
--- Jake ---
Only guessing
But remember when remember when you first met the girls?
And they told you their dreams?
--- Buddy ---
Like it was yesterday
--- Jake ---
Well, Daisy's dream has come true
They're famous now
--- Buddy ---
But Violet doesn't have a husband
--- Jake ---
She could
--- Buddy ---
Of course
She's a wonderful woman
But she is a Siamese twin
--- Jake ---
That wouldn't matter to me
--- Buddy ---
To you?
--- Jake ---
I mean, it wouldn't matter to someone who loved her
--- Terry ---
Well, gentlemen, if you had any doubts,
tonight is proof that we have arrived.
--- Buddy ---
We're dressed for the occasion.
--- Jake ---
Not bad for some bums from the sideshow.
--- Buddy ---
Speak for yourself.
--- Terry ---
And I am so confident about our future,
that I have resigned from the Orpheum Circuit.
--- Buddy ---
You're kidding.
--- Terry ---
I can't stand to be away from our girls.
