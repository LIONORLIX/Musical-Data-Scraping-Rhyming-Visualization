------ Leave Me Alone ------
--- Daisy ---
Terry, how about a good luck kiss?
--- Terry ---
Well-deserved
Break a leg
Have fun
--- Daisy ---
I always have fun when you're around
--- Terry ---
Likewise
You're a good-time girl
--- Unknown ---
Terry leaves...
--- Violet ---
You are shameless
A shameless flirt
--- Daisy ---
Showing some interest couldn't hurt
--- Violet ---
Some?
You show the maximum
--- Daisy ---
And you'd prefer I act like you?
Afraid to show interest
Afraid it's taboo
How will your Buddy
Ever have a clue
That you love him through and through?
--- Violet ---
Don't say that
He might overhear
--- Daisy ---
So what
Why live in fear?
He might feel the same but he's shy
--- Violet ---
So am I
I despise the way you advertise
--- Daisy ---
I hate your coy little act
--- Violet ---
Is that a fact?
--- Daisy ---
Leave me alone
This is none of your business
You don't need to judge
Or offer advice
You're not my mother
You're not my warden
Don't need a strict chaperone
Why don't you leave me alone?
--- Violet ---
Leave you alone?
I am trying to help you
Your blatant behavior
Embarrasses me
If you could see you
From my perspective
You wouldn't like what you were shown
No, I won't leave you alone
--- Daisy ---
Leave me alone
--- Violet ---
And how would I do that?
--- Daisy ---
Leave me alone
--- Violet ---
Tell me where would I go?
--- Daisy ---
Leave me alone
--- Violet ---
Believe me I'd love to
--- Daisy ---
I need some time on my own
Leave me alone
You don't know what you're saying
You'll never find love
By playing it shy
Don't need the wisdom or the opinion
You grandly dispense from your throne
Why don't you leave me alone?
--- Violet ---
Leave you alone?
Can you hear what you're saying?
You won't find love
By chasing a guy
I don't have wisdom just an opinion
My throne? Oh no, I won't
Leave you alone?
--- Daisy ---
That's what I'm asking
--- Violet ---
Leave you alone?
--- Daisy ---
It's a simple request
--- Violet ---
Leave you alone?
--- Daisy ---
I'd be fine without you
I need some time on my own
--- Violet ---
I don't like your tone
--- Daisy ---
Why don't you
--- Violet ---
How could I
--- Daisy ---
I hate you
--- Violet ---
So do I
--- Daisy & Violet ---
