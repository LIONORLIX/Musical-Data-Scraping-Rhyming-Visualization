------ The Devil You Know ------
--- Jake ---
I'm not gonna tell you
You're making a mistake
Tell you not to go
No I won't
I'll only say
What I've learned along my way
The devil you know
Beats the devil you don't
We don't work
In the best of situations
We don't live very well
We don't live in the neighborhood of heaven
We live somewhere closer to hell
Now we have learned
To work around the situation
Learned to hide
Till the heat has passed
You will learn a promise of salvation
Can mask another inferno's blast
The devil you know
Beats the devil you don't
That promised land
Could turn out to be dry
Once you're gone
You might ask yourselves why
Maybe you will
Or maybe you won't
But the devil you know
Beats the devil you don't
Oh yeah

Here you've got
The best home you'll ever find
--- Bearded Lady ---
Other folk
Don't know how to take us
--- Jake ---
The world out there can be so unkind
The devil you know
Beats the devil you don't
His game of chance
Just might be a scam

Devil you know

Beats the devil
The devil you don't
--- Sheik ---
Don't take that chance
--- Harem Girl #2, Sheik, Snake Girl ---
It's just a scam
--- Jake, Roustabout #3 ---
You can't play
Then decide you should scram
--- Jake, Roustabout #1, Roustabout #3, Sheik ---
Maybe you'll win
Or maybe you won't
But the devil you know
--- Bearded Lady, Harem Girl #2, Roustabout #2 ---
Devil you know

Promising more heaven
Than they've ever had
--- Fortune Teller ---
I'm a fortune teller
I can see the future
I can look at people
See what's lying ahead
Violet and Daisy
I see you're bound for glory
That man who was here
Will do all that he said
That man's not a devil
No - Believe it I won't
He's not a devil
No - And miss this chance
I hope that they don't
No don't
No don't
No don't

--- Jake ---
Jealous of what?
--- All ---
That Violet and Daisy
Might give him a shot
--- The "No" Group ---
The devil you know
Beats the devil you don't
That promised land
Could turn out to be dry
So dry
Once you're gone
You might ask yourselves why
Maybe you will
But the devil you know
But the devil you know
But the devil you know
--- The "Yes" Group ---
He's not a devil
I won't believe it
Believe it I won't
Understand
He could be a good guy
Why?
Or maybe you won't
No, no, he's not a devil
No, no, he's not a devil
No, no, he's not a devil
--- Jake ---
Alright
Now we could argue all night
Because we care about you two
Maybe you will go
Or maybe you won't
But I hope you will remember
That that mean old
Money-grubbin'
Gin-guzzlin'
Name-callin'
Devil you know
Might be better than
That smooth talkin'
Fine-lookin'
Dream-spinnin'
Promise makin'
Devil you don't
--- The "Yes" Group ---
No, no, no
Don't call him a devil
No, no, no
Don't call him a devil
No, no, no
Don't call him a devil
--- The "No" Group ---
Beats the devil you don't
Beats the devil you don't
Beats the devil you
--- All ---
Don't
