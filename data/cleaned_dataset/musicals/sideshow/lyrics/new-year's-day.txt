--- Terry ---
We've got rosy red days ahead
Under dreamy blue cloudless sky
--- Buddy ---
We were making due
--- Jake ---
Now we're making hay
--- Terry ---
Let's make the most of
--- Buddy, Jake, Terry ---
This New Year's Day
--- Buddy ---
Everything's new
--- Jake ---
New life
--- Terry ---
New York
--- Buddy, Jake, Terry ---
New Year's Eve
--- Unknown ---
They enter the party with the New York crowd...
--- Terry ---
Thanks for attending our party
We'll cheer as the New Year begins
Let's hear one now, make it hearty
Here they are
The Hilton twins
--- Daisy & Violet ---
We have had an amazing year
We're so glad our new friends are here
--- Daisy ---
You could be in Rome
--- Violet ---
Madrid or St. Tropez
--- Daisy & Violet ---
We're pleased you've joined us
For New Year's Day
--- Party Guest ---
Which Siamese twin is which?
--- Daisy ---
I'm Daisy
--- Violet ---
I'm Violet
--- Daisy & Violet ---
We're not Siamese
--- Party Guest ---
Then what are you?
--- Daisy & Violet ---
Twins
Who are conjoined
--- Party Guest ---
Whatever you are
Don't you want to be normal?
--- Violet ---
Whoever you are
Don't you?
--- Party Guest ---
Don't you want husbands?
--- Daisy ---
Is that a proposal?
--- Party Guest ---
What if it is?
--- Daisy ---
Sorry, I'm already attached
--- Party Guest ---
Could you have children?
--- Violet ---
Not with you
--- Party Guest ---
But could you?
With your condition
--- Violet ---
The so-called Siamese twins
Chang and Eng had wives
And twenty two kids
--- Daisy ---
But now we're much too busy with our career
--- Violet ---
As we celebrate a brand new year
--- Daisy ---
The party's just begun
--- Violet ---
Enjoy yourselves
--- Daisy & Violet ---
Have fun
--- Unknown ---
The party guests go off to dance...
--- Buddy ---
Violet, what's wrong?
I can tell you're not happy
--- Violet ---
It's New Year's Eve
Doesn't everyone get blue?
--- Buddy ---
Not me
I'm with my favorite girl
--- Violet ---
You mean business associate
--- Buddy ---
Violet!
--- Violet ---
That's what you tell reporters
--- Buddy ---
Those idiots
They don't deserve the truth
--- Violet ---
What is the truth?
--- Buddy ---
Our friendship goes deeper
Than working together
--- Violet ---
Deeper?
--- Buddy ---
A bottomless well of love
--- Violet ---
Love?
--- Buddy ---
What else could it be?
Have you ever felt this way
With anyone before?
--- Violet ---
I haven't
Have you?
--- Buddy ---
You're the family I've never had
The friend I've always wanted
--- Violet ---
I'm glad
--- Buddy ---
Good. Could I see a smile please?
--- Violet ---
I guess so.
--- Buddy ---
What do I have to do?
Get down on my kness for you
I'm getting down on my kness
Begging you to smile
--- Violet ---
You're embarrassing me.
--- Buddy ---
I'm making you laugh a little.
--- Terry ---
Buddy, what's going on over there?
You look like you're proposing.
--- Violet ---
He's not. He's making fun of me.
--- Buddy ---
I am not! Violet refuses to believe I love her.
--- Daisy ---
You do?
--- Buddy ---
Of course.
--- Terry ---
Well, then you are proposing.
--- Violet ---
He's not.
--- Buddy ---
Would that make you happy?
--- Daisy ---
Couldn't hurt!
--- Violet ---
Daisy!
--- Terry ---
What a story that would make.
--- Daisy ---
Hey, can I be the made of honor?
--- Violet ---
Stop it! All of you!
Stop making fun of me.
--- Buddy ---
Oh, please don't cry!
That's the last thing I want.
--- Violet ---
I'm sorry. I can't joke about this.
--- Buddy ---
This isn't a joke.
Violet, I love you
I don't know how else to say it
I want you to be my wife
I dream of you sharing my life
Violet Hilton, you make me so happy.
Allow me to do the same.
Marry me?
--- Daisy ---
If you don't say yes,
I'm going to have a heart attack that will kill us both!
--- Buddy ---
What are you waiting for
What's so hard?
--- Violet ---
I'm caught by surprise
Caught off-guard
Never trusted good times or success
Now I'm trusting my heart
I'm saying yes, Buddy
I'll marry you
--- Buddy ---
We've got heavenly nights to share
--- Violet ---
Heavenly nights to share
--- Buddy ---
Shooting stars to outshine
--- Violet ---
Shooting stars
--- Buddy & Violet ---
And our shot at the moon
Can't miss or ricochet
--- Terry ---
Let's make it public
For New Year's Day
--- Buddy ---
What about a big double wedding?
--- Violet ---
Oh, what a splendid display
--- Daisy ---
Could it be that's where we're heading?
--- Terry ---
Time to welcome New Year's Day
--- Buddy, Daisy, Terry, Violet ---
We've got rosy red days ahead
Under dreamy blue cloudless sky
We've got years of bliss
To kiss away each day
Here's to the good times
We're on our way
--- Terry ---
Love is the lead-in
For New Year's Day
Ladies and gents, the hour is upon us
And I have big news
With which the celebrate the New Year.
The lovely Violet Hilton
Has accepted a marriage proposal
From Mr. Buddy Foster!
--- Company ---
We've got rosy red days ahead
Under dreamy blue cloudless sky
As the old year wanes
Love will lead the way
Here's to a new love
May it be true love
One-made-from-two love
For New Year's Day
For New Year's Day
For New Year's Day
--- Daisy ---
Happy New Year.
--- Violet ---
Happy New Year.
Jake, I'm finally getting married!
--- Jake ---
Buddy's a lucky guy.
--- Terry ---
Our guests are leaving.
You girls go make your goodbyes.
--- Unknown ---
Daisy, Violet and Jake leave...
--- Buddy ---
What do you mean?
--- Terry ---
Getting Violet to marry you.
That is the story of the year, the decade!
--- Buddy ---
That's not why I did it!
--- Terry ---
Of course not.
--- Buddy ---
I can't stand to see her unhappy
And now she won't be.
--- Terry ---
Everyone benefits.
--- Buddy ---
Hey, why don't you marry Daisy,
Since there's such an obvious connection between you two.
--- Terry ---
What do you mean obvious connection?
Maybe to her way of thinking.
--- Buddy ---
Only hers?
--- Terry ---
Go on, I gotta get some air.
