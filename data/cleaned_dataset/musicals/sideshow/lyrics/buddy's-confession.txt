Buddy
I've tried
But I'm playing a part
I've tried
And it's breaking my heart
--- Unknown ---
Violet
You don't love me?
--- Unknown ---
Buddy
I do, Violet
But not the way you want
I'm not that strong of a man
--- Unknown ---
Violet
But you're the man I love
--- Unknown ---
Buddy
You should be loved
By someone like Jake
Somebody strong
Who's able to take
Whatever comes alon

Sharing life with two
Is more than I can do
If only I'd known that before
Loving you is more
Than I bargained for
