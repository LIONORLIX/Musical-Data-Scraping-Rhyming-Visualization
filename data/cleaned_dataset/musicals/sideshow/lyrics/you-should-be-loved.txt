------ You Should Be Loved ------
--- Jake ---
You should be loved
By someone who knows you
Wants you to blossom
Always is true
You should be cherished
Like the first sign of springtime
You should be loved
You should be loved
With constant devotion
Heart-pounding passion
Flooding you through
You should be treasured
Like a ruby or a diamond
You should be loved in the way
I love you
All through the years I've held oceans inside
Held back the tears
And the waves and the tide
The dam had to burst
And the currents collide
With the flood of emotion I can no longer hide
We should be close
As stars are to heaven
Shoreline to ocean
Birds to the blue
We should be coupled
With a lifetime connection
We should be joined
Like we're one and not two
Yes, you should be loved
In the way I love you
--- Violet ---
Jake, of course we love each other
Like a brother and sister
Or mother and child
Not in a way that is wild like
--- Jake ---
Haven't you heard what I'm saying?
I am in love with you
--- Violet ---
Oh, Jake
Oh no
I never thought
Never felt
--- Jake ---
What I felt?
--- Violet ---
I never knew
--- Jake ---
Well now you do
--- Violet ---
You know me better than anyone
Except Daisy
You've always been more than a friend
You know I don't long to see Paris or Rome
All that I want is a husband and home
--- Jake ---
I could be both
--- Violet ---
The world won't let you
--- Jake ---
I don't care about them
Only you
With love
We could rise above the whispers and stares
We could challengee the powers of fate
We could master a bad circumstance
If you give me a chance
We should be close
--- Violet ---
We are close
Like a brother and sister
Mother and child
--- Jake ---
As stars are to heaven
Shoreline to ocean
Birds to the blue
We should be coupled
With a lifetime connection
--- Violet ---
The world won't let us
--- Jake ---
We should be joined
Like we're one and not two
--- Violet ---
I know what people do
--- Jake ---
Yes, you should be loved
--- Violet ---
I am loved
And in my way I love you
--- Jake ---
In the way I love you
--- Violet ---
I want to be like everyone else
I couldn't bear what they would say
If I loved you that way

Buddy and Terry enter...
--- Terry ---
Hey, great news!
Texas has come through!
--- Buddy ---
And not only with a marriage license!
--- Terry ---
Tell them, Buddy.
--- Buddy ---
Violet, our wedding is going to be the grand finale
Of the Texas Centennial!
Can you believe it?
--- Terry ---
Right there on the fifty yard line of the Cotton Bowl,
In front of thousands of people.
You'll be on every front page in the country.
--- Daisy ---
Oh, really?
--- Terry ---
Let's go celebrate.
--- Buddy ---
Jake, you come, too.
You're part of the family.
--- Daisy ---
That's right, Jake.
You're family, and always will be.
--- Unknown ---
Buddy, Terry, Daisy and Violet leave...
--- Jake ---
If I can see past your affliction
Why can't you see past mine?
Why do you care what people might say?
Why try to fit into their design?
If I had told you your love was a lie
Would you have kissed it goodbye?
One of these days
You will look back in shame
After you've learned
That a spark's not a flame
You will regret how you pushed love aside
When you're married to nothing
When you're misery's bride
You should be loved
By someone who wants you
Tries to protect you
Always comes through
You should have chosen
The one who supports you
Always supports you whatever you do
Yes, you should be loved
In the way I love you

The group arrives in Texas the day before the wedding...
--- Terry ---
Just look at that!
--- Violet ---
That's the biggest billboard I've ever seen!
--- Buddy ---
Well, we're in Texas.
Everything's the biggest.
--- Daisy ---
Well, I don't see our names.
--- Terry ---
Oh, believe me, a mammouth sign that reads
'The wedding of a Siamese twin',
People will know it's referring to you.
--- Daisy ---
Me? I didn't know I was getting married.
--- Buddy ---
Are you gonna start again?
--- Daisy ---
What if I am?
--- Terry ---
Buddy, stay out of this.
--- Buddy ---
Terry, are you gonna let her pout all through the wedding tomorrow?
--- Violet ---
Buddy, Daisy's under a lot of strain.
--- Buddy ---
Well so am I.
--- Terry ---
So be a man and deal with it.
--- Buddy ---
All right, geez.
--- Terry ---
Daisy, I know this is difficult,
But in the bigger picture it is helping you realize your dream.
--- Daisy ---
Is it?
--- Terry ---
Well, the whole country's talking about you.
--- Daisy ---
About me?
--- Terry ---
Look, it's understandable that you're feeling a little neglected,
And I know I've been too busy to give you the attention you deserve.
I think we need some time alone.
Just the four of us.
