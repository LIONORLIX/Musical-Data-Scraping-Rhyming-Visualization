--- Violet ---
Daisy, can you hear what I'm thinking?
--- Daisy ---
Yes, clearly as though you spoke
--- Violet ---
Give me strength
I feel my spirits sinking
--- Daisy ---
Try to laugh
This is the biggest joke
We have seen the world
--- Violet ---
And it's seen us
--- Daisy ---
We have caused a scene
--- Violet ---
We have made a fuss
Are we ever to learn why we lived as two?
--- Daisy ---
Probably not
But I'm thankful
--- Daisy & Violet ---
It's been with you
--- Daisy ---
Come look at the freaks
--- Violet ---
Before they're antiques
--- Daisy & Violet ---
Come and give them a stong ovation
An acclamation
But no critiques
--- Daisy ---
See what Hollywood seeks
--- Daisy & Vioet ---
Come look at the freaks
--- The Boss ---
Good people, we are gathered here today to join two souls as one.
If there be anyone present who knows of a reason these two should
Not be joined together, let him speak now or forever hold his peace
Come look at the freaks
--- Company ---
See the bride
Curiosity satisfied
Come and give them a strong ovation
An acclamation
But no critiques
See love glorified
See love glorified
See love glorified
See love glorified
Come hear how love speaks
Come look at the freaks!
