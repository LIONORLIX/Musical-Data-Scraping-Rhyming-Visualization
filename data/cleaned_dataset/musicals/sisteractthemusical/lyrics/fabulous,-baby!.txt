Look at my style, could it be more glam?
Lood at my look, can you say, hot damn?
Look, an' at once, you know what i am:
Me, i'm fabolous baby!

Look at my moves, don't they blow your mind?
Drama, and talent, and sex - combined!
Hell, you could tell even if you're blind!
See? I'm fabolous, baby!
--- Unknown ---
I'm meant to be where the spotlight shines!
Born to be on display!
Built to be dressed to the ninety-nines,
And ready to stand and say - hey.

Look at me!
Can'tcha see,
I'm fabolous, baby!
Look right here,
Ain't it clear,
Where i'm heading to?
And look at the time -
Honey, i can't stay!
Look while you can,
'Cause i'm on my way!
Me, i'm fabolous baby.
I got fabolous things to do!

Deloris/kt/larosa
Can'tcha see me lit up on a stage
As the cameras adore me! (ah!)
Can'tcha see me out walkin' red carpets - or doin' tv? (ooo!)
Can'tcha see all my millions of fans
Screamin' desp'rately for me?
--- Unknown ---
I'm a diva, a goddess,
A star on the brink!
A house-rocking vision
In hot shocking pink!
A party! A riot!
The whole kitchen sink!
It's time for the world to find out,
Don'tcha think? Wo-ho-ho
Look at me,
Can'tcha see!

She's fabolous, baby!

Feast your eyes,
Can't disguise
My star quality!
So laugh all you want,
I won't be denied.
What i have got is too hot to hide!
I am fabolous, baby!
So damn fabolous, baby!
I'll do fabolous, guarantee!
I'll be fabolous, baby,
Fresh, free, fabolous, baby!
Fine and fabolous,
Wait and see!
