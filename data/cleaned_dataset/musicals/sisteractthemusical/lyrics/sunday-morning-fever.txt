Until it makes you a believer.

But lord, you're killing us with
The cure!

Sanctuary overflows with your fabulous
Devotion! So, get down, get

Until you pull your pelvic muscle!

Just brings more attention.
And you won't be so fabulous if
You're dead.

Now, put your hands in the air!
And wave 'em all around in prayer!
Let your funky behavior
Show that you and the savior
Got each other like sonny and cher!
--- Mary lazarus ---
A hip, hop. A hippity a hippity
A ding dong dippity dee!
I'm a celibate sister,
But i'm hot as a blister
So hang onto your rosary!
Now i may be a fossil,
But my skills
Are colossal,
And i rock the mig just like an apostle,
And i don't stop
'Til your doubts go pop.
And i take you over the top!
