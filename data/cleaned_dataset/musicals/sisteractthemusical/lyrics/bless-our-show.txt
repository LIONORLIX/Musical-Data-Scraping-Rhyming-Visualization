------ Bless Our Show ------
--- Deloris ---
Bless our show,
Bless our music,
Bless the songs we?re gonna sing.
Bless the stage that we?ll stand on
When we stand and do our thing.
Bless each line, every number,
All the steps that we?ve rehearsed.
And allow us, somehow to be great,
At the worst.
Bless each note,
And each lyric,
Help us try to stay on key.
Bless the lights
And the soundboard,
Bless our choreography.
From the top of the downbeat
'Till the final curtain call -
Bless the day,
Bless our show,
Bless it all!
