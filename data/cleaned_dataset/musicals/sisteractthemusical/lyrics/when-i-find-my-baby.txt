------ When I Find My Baby ------
--- Shank ---
I know the way that she thinks,
I know her habits and kinks.
I know the staff she’s all about.
I know the people she knows
At all the places she goes.
I know her up, down, inside out.
I know the needs that she’s got,
I know what gets the girl hot.
I know i’ve got the inside track.
And yeah, i know she’s upset
Well, let her play hard-to-get.
‘cause if i know one thing,
I’m gettin’ her back!
--- Unknown ---
Because i know that girl!
I mean, i feel that girl!
I understand that girl!
And if i want that girl!
I’m gonna get that girl!
Ain’t gonna let that girl get away!
No way!
And when i find that girl,
I’m gonna kill that girl!
I’m gonna wham! Bam! Blam!
And drill that girl!
Won’t rest until that girl
Is safe and sound six feet below’ no!
When i find my baby,
I ain’t lettin’ her go!
--- Shank/goons ---
I bet wherever she’s at
I bet she’s trapped like a rat
And pacin’ up, down, ‘round
The floor. (sure, sure.)
I bet she’s startin’ to sweat.
That gir is buggin’, i bet.
Bet she’s got one eye on the door.
I bet she’s missin’ her gigs.
I bet she’s missin’ her booze,
I bet she’s tearin’ out her hair.
I bet she’s missin’ her fun,
And gettin’ ready to run.
And when she does,
You bet i’m gonna be there.
--- Guys/shank ---
Because you know that girl!
You she right through that girl!
You understand that girl!
And when you get that girl,
You’re gonna waste that girl,
‘cause you can’t let that girl
Go and squeal. (squeal for real.)
--- Shank/goons ---
I’m gonna shoot that girl!
And then i’ll stab that girl,
And then i’ll take her
And shake her,
And make her meet her maker!
Let ‘em hide that girl
Sure as the tide, that girl
Will show
oh! (oh!)
When i find my baby,
I ain’t lettin’ her go!
--- Unknown ---
Yeah, yeah.
Oh yes, i know that girl!
And man, i need that girl!
I gotta have that girl!
So i can snuff that girl!
If i know my baby! (ahhhh!)
She’s already runnin’! (ahhhh!)
That’s how my baby
Is gonna be done in!
--- Unknown ---
I’m gonna drown that girl!
Or disembowel that girl!
Or give her skull a big dent
With a blunt instrument!
I tell ya, soon that girl
Is lookin’ at a world of woe!
Wo, (wo, wo ,wo!) Wo, wo!
When i find my baby,
I ain’t lettin’ her go! (no!)
I know she ain’t gone too far! (oh!)
Go and check
Each discothecque,
Tavern and bar!
Go and find my baby
‘cause i ain’t lettin’ her go!
Oh no!
