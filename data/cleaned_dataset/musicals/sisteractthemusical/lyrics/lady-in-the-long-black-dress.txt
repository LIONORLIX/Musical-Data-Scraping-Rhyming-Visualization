To you. My name's bones. I'm a libra, a dig
Sunsets, strolling on the beach, and loving
My neighbor as myself. And right now,
Baby, i'm standing next door to you.]

Picture you and me one
Sweet, sweet night
In a pool of votive candlelight.
Just one thing could make the
Mood more right ?
God droppin' in to sing like
Barry white.
Hey, lady in the long black dress,
Let's give you something to confess.
Wo oh oh! Hey lady, take a good long glance.

Girl, 'cause i'm here to sweep you off
Your knees and take you to a place i like
To call tj town. So?]

Vows permit ?
