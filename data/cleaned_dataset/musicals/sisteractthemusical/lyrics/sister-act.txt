------ Sister Act ------
--- DELORIS ---
I don’t need a spotlight,
I don’t need a crowd,
I don’t need the great wide world
to shout my name out loud.
Don’t need fame or fortune,
nice as those things are,
I’ve got all I need
to feel like I’m a star.
--- Unknown ---
I’ve got my sisters by my side.
I’ve got my sisters' love and pride.
And in my sisters' eyes
I recognize the star I want to be.
--- Unknown ---
And with my sisters standing strong,
I’m on the stage where I belong.
And nothing’s ever gonna change that fact.
I’m part of one terrific sister act.
--- Unknown ---
And yes, I love that spotlight!
Yes I crave acclaim!
I’ll admit I love the sound
when strangers scream my name.
All that glitz and glamour,
they’re all right no doubt.
But what are you left with
when the lights go out’
--- Unknown ---
I’ll have my sisters with me still,
I’ll have my sisters, always will.
And with my sisters' love,
no star above will shine as
bright as me.
--- Unknown ---
And as a sister and a friend,
I’ll be a sister ‘til the end,
and no one on this earth can
change that fact -
I’m part of one terrific sister act.
