------ Where, Oh, Where? ------
--- CHLOE ---
I often ask because I feel
I've every right to ask
Will time take on the task  to reveal
Yes or no,
My beau ideal?
--- Unknown ---
For even though when I'm abed
I dream he holds me tight
Awake, I never light on the man
I plan one day to wed.
--- Unknown ---
Where, oh where
Is that combination so rare?
The cute night in armor,
Completely a charmer,
Who'd still be a millionare?
--- Unknown ---
Where, oh where
Is that combination so rare?
A youth who is able to wrap me in sable,
Who'd still be a love affair?
--- Unknown ---
I could accept a cottage small by a roaring waterfall,
Yet I'd much prefer a castle cool by a marble swimming pool.
--- Unknown ---
But where, oh where
Is that combination so rare?
A highly admissable, kissable boy
To fill me with, practically kill me with joy?
Who'd still be a millionare?
Tell me, where, oh where, oh where?
