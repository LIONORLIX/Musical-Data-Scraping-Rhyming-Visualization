------ From This Moment On ------
--- HELEN ---
Now that we are close
No more nights morose
--- ART ---
Now that we are one
The beguine has just begun
--- HELEN ---
Now that we're side by side
The future looks so gay
--- ART ---
Now we are allbied when we say
--- HELEN AND ART ---
From this moment on
You for me, dear
Only two for tea, dear
From this moment on
--- Unknown ---
From this happy day
No more blue songs
Only whoop-dee-doo songs
From this moment on
--- HELEN ---
For you've got the love
I need so much
--- ART ---
Got the skin
I love to touch
--- HELEN ---
Got the arms to hold me tight
--- ART ---
Got the sweet lips to kiss me goodnight.
--- HELEN AND ART ---
From this moment on
You and I, babe
We'll be riding high, babe
Every care is gone
From this moment on.

You for me, dear
Only two for tea, dear
From this moment on.

From this happy day
No more blue songs
Only whoop-dee-doo songs
From this moment on.

For you've got the love I need so much

Got the arms to hold me tight
