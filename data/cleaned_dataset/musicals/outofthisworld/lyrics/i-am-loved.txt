------ I Am Loved ------
--- HELEN ---
Yesterday was a dull day
Yesterday was a gray day
But, ah, today
Today's a May Day.
You ask me why, and I answer:
I am loved.
I am loved.
I have what I love in every way.
I am loved
Absolutely loved
What a wonderful thing to be able to say.
I'm adored
I'm adored
By the one who first led my heart astray.
I'm adored
Absolutely adored
What a wonderful thing to be able to say.
So ring out the bells
And let the trumpets roar
And beat on the drums
I am loved
I am loved.
What a wonderful thing
What a glorious thing
What a beautiful thing
To be able to say.
