------ Climb Up The Mountain ------
--- GODS AND GODDESSES ---
Climb up the mountain
Climb up the mountain
Climb up the mountain
And lay your burden down.
Yes, yes, yes
Here's where  the gods receive
You'd think that each night was New Year's Eve
Oh, climb up the mountain
And lay your burden
Lay your burden down!
Lay it down.
--- JUNO ---
Stop!
Who e'er ye be.
Stop, look and listen to me.
I've got an invite for everyone.
--- GODS AND GODDESSES ---
Climb up the mountain.
--- JUNO ---
If you've a hanker to have some fun
--- GODS AND GODDESSES ---
Climb up the mountain.
--- JUNO ---
Instead of beginning to beef and bawl
Instead of frequenting the wailing wall
On gay Mount Olympus come pay a call.
--- GODS AND GODDESSES ---
Climb up the mountain.
Oh,
--- JUNO ---
Climb up the mountain
Climb up the mountain
Climb up the mountain
And lay your burden down.
--- GODS AND GODDESSES ---
Yes, yes, yes
--- JUNO ---
Here in this lovely land
Cupie and Whoopy go hand in hand.
Oh, climb  up the mountain
And lay your burden down.
--- GODS AND GODDESSES ---
Yes, yes, yes
--- JUNO ---
Here, when try to please
Falsies are also necesseties
--- GODS AND GODDESSES ---
Oh, climb up the mountain
And lay your burden,
Lay your burden down.
Lay it, lay it, lay it, lay it, lay it, lay it, lay it down!
