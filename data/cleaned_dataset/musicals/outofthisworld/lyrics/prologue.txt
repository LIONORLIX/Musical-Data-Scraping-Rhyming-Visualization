------ Prologue ------
--- MERCURY ---
Ladies and gentlemen:
This costume may strike you as odd.
But how can you wonder why
If bizarrely dressed am I?
I'm a god, I'm a god, I'm a god!
--- Unknown ---
My name is Mercury,
The son of Jupiter, and Juno, his wife.
And though seas are never calm
Since I shipped with Pop and Mom,
Still, at least I lead an interesting life.
--- Unknown ---
Now, as Mercury, I beg of thee,
Every now and then to chortle
At the crazy tale we're about to unveil
'Tis the tale of my sire and his sudden desire
For a fair American mortal.
--- Unknown ---
He's getting mighty impatient today.
Just listen to what he has to say.
