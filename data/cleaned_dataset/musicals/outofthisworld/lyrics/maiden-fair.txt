--- CHLOE ---
Maiden fair, maiden fair
Best beware, best beware
Keep thy charms well out of sight
Lock thee in thy chamber right
For this is midsummer night.
Jupiter is coming down.
Jupiter is coming

Jupiter is coming down.
Beware, beware, beware.
Beware, beware.

And lock thee tonight
In thy chamber tight.
--- CHLOE AND GIRLS ---
Beware, beware, beware.
--- CHLOE ---
For Jupiter is coming
