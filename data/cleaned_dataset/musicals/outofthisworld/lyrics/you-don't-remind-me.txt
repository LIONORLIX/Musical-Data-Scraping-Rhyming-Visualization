------ You Don't Remind Me ------
--- JUPITER ---
You don't remind me
Of the iris in spring
Or of dawn up the mountain
When the bluebird starts to sing.
--- Unknown ---
You don't remind me
Of the breeze of the day
Or of stars in the fountain
Where the silver fishes play.
--- Unknown ---
To the moon in September
You relive nor resemble this.
Of the first snow in November
You're not even a similar bliss.
--- Unknown ---
No, you don't remind me
Of the wold aroun or behind me
For so much does my love blind me
That my darling, you only remind me
Of you, of you
Of you.
