------ No Lover (For Me) ------
--- HELEN ---
No lover,
No lover for me.
My husband suits me to a T.
No lover,
No fiddle-dee-dee
My husband is but heavenly
Since the moment his kisses
Upon me were hurled
It's been all hits,
No misses
For he's just out of this world.
Yes, my husband suits me to a T
So no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
No lover for me.
--- Unknown ---
So many wives i meet today
Complain because theirs husbands won't play
So many wives to find romance
Dash off to Paris
But for carresses made in France.
Let them live their lives.
I'm the most contented of wives.

No lover,
No lover for me.
My husband suits me to a T.
No lover,
No fiddle-dee-dee.
My husband is but heavenly.
There is something about him,
With glamour so glossed,
That each moment without him
Is just paradise lost.
Yes, my husband suits me to a T.
So no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
No lover for me.
