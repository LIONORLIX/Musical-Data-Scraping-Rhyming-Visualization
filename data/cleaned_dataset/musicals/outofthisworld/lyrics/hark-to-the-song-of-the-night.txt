------ Hark To The Song Of The Night ------
--- JUPITER ---
Come out, oh my beloved,
Come out.
Come out, oh my beloved,
Come out.
come out, oh my beloved,
The stars sing in the skies.
Come  out, of my beloved,
That I may gaze in your eyes.
Hark, hark
Hark to the song of the night, sweetheart,
Oh, hark to the song of the night.
'Tis a soft serenade
And the words all are true
For they tell of my love
And my longing for you.
So hark to the song of the night, sweetheart,
And yield me your infinite charms
Lest the song die away
There you whisper,
I swear to stay
Forevermore in your arms
Forevermore, forevermore
In your arms.
