------ Use Your Imagination ------
--- HELEN ---
Use your imagination
Just take this motto for your theme.
And soon every night
Will be crowded with delight
And every day will be a dream.
--- Unknown ---
Use your imagination
You'll see such wonders if you do.
Around you there lies
Pure enchantment in disguise
And endless joys you never knew.
--- Unknown ---
Behind every cloud
There's a so-lovely star.
Behind every star,
There's a lovelier one by far.
--- Unknown ---
So use your imagination
Just take this motto for your theme.
And soon you will dance
On the road to sweet romance
And every day will be a dream.
And every day will be a perfect dream.
