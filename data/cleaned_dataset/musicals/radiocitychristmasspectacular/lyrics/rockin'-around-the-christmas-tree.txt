------ Rockin' Around The Christmas Tree ------
--- Unknown ---
Rocking around the christmas tree
At the christmas party hop
Mistletoe hung where you can see
Ev'ry couple tries to stop
--- Unknown ---
Rocking around the christmas tree
Let the christmas spirit ring
Later we'll have some pumpkin pie
And we'll do some caroling
--- Unknown ---
You will get a sentimental feeling when you hear voices singing
let's be jolly; deck the halls with boughs of holly rocking around the christmas tree
Have a happy holiday
Everyone's dancing merrily
In a new old fashioned way
