------ You Two ------
--- Caractacus ---
Do you think I'm a lunatic? Wasting my time on a lot of silly inventions?
--- Jemima ---
But they aren't silly--they're wonderful!
--- Jeremy ---
Nobody else could think of them!
--- Caractacus ---
That's right! That is right--nobody else could think of
them!--yeah--after all...
What makes the battle worth the fighting?
What makes the mountain worth the climb?
What makes the questions worth the asking?
The reason worth the rhyme?
--- Caractacus ---
To me the answer's clear;
it's having someone near; someone dear
Someone to care for; to be there for.
I have You Two!
Someone to do for; muddle through for.
I have You Two!
Someone to share joy or despair with;
whichever betides you.
Life becomes a chore, unless you're living for
someone to tend to be a friend to.
I have You Two!
Someone to strive for, do or die for
I have You Two!
Could be, we three get along so famously,
'cause you two have me, and I have You Two too.

Someone to care for; to be there for.
--- Caractacus ---
I have You Two!
--- Kids ---
Someone to do for; muddle through for
--- Caractacus ---
I have You Two!
Someone to smile once in awhile with;
whenever you're lonesome
I've a happy lot,
considering what I've got.
But, I couldn't do more
Than you do for your poor Father.

(Kids: Daddy!)
--- Unknown ---
Things go asunder
and I wonder why you bother.
All:
Could be, we three get along so famously
'cause
--- Kids ---
we two have you,
--- Caractacus ---
and I have You Two
--- All ---
