------ Doll on a Music Box/Truly Scrumptious ------
--- Unknown ---
What do you see
You people gazing at me
You see a doll on a music box
That's wound by a key
How can you tell
I'm under a spell
I'm waiting for love's first kiss
You cannot see
How much I long to be free
Turning around on this music box
That's wound by a key
Yearning
Yearning
While
I'm turning around and around
What do you see
You people gazing at me
You see a doll on a music box, that's wound by a key
How can you tell I'm
Under a spell I'm
Waiting for love's first kiss
You cannot see
How much I long to be free
Turning around on this music box that's wound by a key
Yearning
Yearning
While I'm turning around and around)
