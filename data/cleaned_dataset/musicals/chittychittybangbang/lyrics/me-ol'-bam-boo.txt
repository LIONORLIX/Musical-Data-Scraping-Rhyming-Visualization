------ Me Ol' Bam-Boo ------
--- All ---
A gentleman's got a walking stick.
A seaman's got a gaff.
And the merry men of Robin Hood
They used a quarterstaff.
On the Spanish plains inside their canes
They hide their ruddy swords.
But we make do with an old bam-boo
And everyone applauds!
1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5 - 6 - 7 - Hey!
Me ol' bam-boo, me ol' bam-boo
You'd better never bother with me ol' bam-boo.
You can have me hat or me bum-ber-shoo
But you'd better never bother with me ol' bam-boo.
--- Chorus ---
When punting on the beautiful Thames
--- Caractacus ---
You use a sturdy pole.
--- Chorus ---
To protect their fair complexion
--- Caractacus ---
Ladies use a parasol.
--- Chorus ---
It's useful in the underbrush
--- Caractacus ---
To have a hefty spear.
--- Chorus ---
Right!
--- All ---
But what we do with an old bam-boo
Makes everybody cheer!
1 - 2 - 3 - HO!
Me ol' bam-boo, me ol' bam-boo
You'd better never bother with me ol' bam-boo
You can have me hat or me bum-ber-shoo
But you'd better never bother with me ol' bam-boo
'Ere we go, mate . . .
--- Caractacus ---
A flyer in an air-e-o-plane
--- Chorus ---
He steers it with a stick
--- Caractacus ---
He does?
--- Caractacus ---
A collier in the pits o' Wales
--- Chorus ---
He leans upon his pick
--- Caractacus ---
That's right!
--- All ---
Now every wheel of an automobile
Revolves around a shaft (HEY!)
But what we do with an old bam-boo
Makes every one go daft.
And 1 - 2
Me ol' bam-boo, me ol' bam-boo
You'd better never bother with me ol' bam-boo.
You can have me hat or me bum-ber-shoo
But you'd better never bother with me ol' bam-boo.
1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5 - 6 - 7 - HEY!
And a 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - and a 5 and a 6 and a 7 HO!
Me ol' bam-boo, me ol' bam-boo
You'd better never bother with me ol' bam-boo.
You can have me hat or me bum-ber-shoo
But you'd better never bother with me ol' bam-boo.
