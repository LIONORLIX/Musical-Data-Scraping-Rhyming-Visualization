------ Dancing ------
--- Unknown ---
Dolly
Put your hand on her waist and stand
With her right in your left hand
And one two three, one two three, one two three
Cornelius
Look I'm dancing!
Well, I was.
Dolly
Of course you were, Mr. Hackl!
Take the someone whose arms you're in
Hold onto her tight and spin
And one two three, one two three, one two three
Cornelius
Wow, I'm dancing!
Dolly
Turn around and turn around, try floating through the air
Can't you be a little more aesthetic?
Cornelius
Don't you think my dancing has a polish and a flair?
Dolly
The word I think I'd use is athletic!
Cornelius
Well my heart is about to burst
My head is about to pop
And now that I'm dancing who cares if I ever stop!
...Look at lne, everybody! I, Cornelius Hackl...Sport
...Am dancing!
Dolly
You're next, Mr. Tucker!
Glide and step and then step and glide
Barnaby
And everyone stand aside!
Cornelius
He's dancing!
Dolly
You could learn to polka if you worked a week or so
Or the tango filled with passion seething
Barnaby
I might join the chorus of the castle garden show
Dolly
Whatever you do for gosh shakes keep breathing
Barnaby, Dolly and Cornelius
For my heart is about to burst
My head is about to pop
And now that I'm dancing who cares if I ever stop!
Mrs. Molloy
When there's someone you hardly know
But wish you were closer to
Remember that he can be near to you
While you're dancing
Though you've only just said hello
He's suddenly someone who
Can make all your daydreams appear to you
While you're dancing
Make the music weave a spell
Whirl away your worry
Things look almost twice as well
When you're slightly blurry
Dolly
As around and around you go
Your spirits will hit the top
Dolly, Cornelius, & Mrs. Molloy
And now that we're dancing
Who cares if we ever stop
Mrs. Molloy, Barnaby, Dolly and Cornelius
One-two-three
One-two-three
One-two
And now that we're dancing
