------ Ribbons Down My Back ------
--- Unknown ---
Irene Molly
I'll be wearing ribbons down my back this summer
Blue & Green and streaming in the yellow sky
So if someone special comes my way this summer
He might notice me passing by
And so I'll try to make it easier to find me
In the silliness of July
Because a breeze might stir a rainbow up behind me
That might happen to catch the gentleman's eye
And he might smile and take me by the hand
This summer
Making me recall how lovely love can be
And so I will proudly wear
Ribbons down my back
Shining in my hair
