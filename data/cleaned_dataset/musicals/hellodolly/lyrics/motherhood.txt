Dolly
I know what I stand for! Important things! Like...like...
Motherhood,
America,
And a hot lunch for orphans
Take off your hat, sir
While your country's flag is passing
Do you see him
On the hill at Gettysburg
'Neath that great triumphal arch?
If you see him as he's trampling through the grapes of wrath
Stand up and march, march, march!

Mrs. Molloy
I stand for motherhood,
America,
And a hot lunch for orphans
Take off your hat, sir
There's a tear-stained eagle passing
Do you see him
On the field at Waterloo
'Neath that great triumphal arch?
--- Unknown ---
Mrs. Molloy & Mianie
If you hear him singing Dixie in the sugar cane
Stand up and march, march, march!

Alamo!
Remember the Alamo!
I regret that I've one
Life to give for my
Country
In the words of Lincoln
One if by land
And two if by sea
Yes Dad I chopped
That cherry tree down
