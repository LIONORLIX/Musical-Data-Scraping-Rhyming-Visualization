Hello, Harry
Well, Hello Louie
It's so nice to be back home where I belong
You're looking swell, Manny
I can tell, Danny
You're still glowin', you're still crowin'
You're still goin' strong
For the band's playin'
One of my old favorite songs from way back when
So bridge that gap, fellas
Find me an empty lap, fellas
Dolly'll never go away again
