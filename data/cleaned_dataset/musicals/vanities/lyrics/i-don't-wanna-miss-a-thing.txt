------ I Don't Wanna Miss A Thing ------
--- Unknown ---
Isn't it amazing
I can feel this great like the whole worlds waiting on me
--- Unknown ---
When I snap my fingers people all count out
And I guess thats how it was meant to be
--- Unknown ---
My futures near so I'm aiming straight ahead
Cause it's all garenteed I will get what I need
Like my parents always said
--- Unknown ---
I'm telling you (uh oh)
I don't wanna miss a thing (no)
I know I can have it all (whoa)
I want the american dream
My mom and dad both promised
That I'll have it on a string
I'll be living in bliss
And I don't wanna miss a thing
--- Unknown ---
Everyday is Christmas
The whole year long and theres nothing wrong about that
--- Unknown ---
I get all I ask for
From a teddy bear to a troll doll wearing a pill box heat
--- Unknown ---
As for my goals theres no secret in my search
Be a mother and wife for the rest of my life
With a few short breaks for church
--- Unknown ---
So sing it now (uh oh)
I don't wanna miss a thing (no)
I'm not gunna be denied (whoa)
I want the american dream
And I'll have the perfect husband
And the perfect diamond ring
Moving on with a kiss
And I don't wanna miss a thing
--- Unknown ---
I wanna have a couple kids
I wanna join a country club
I wanna live just like a queen
I'm Miss America
--- Unknown ---
I wanna bake a casserole
I wanna make a jello mold
I wanna cook but never clean
I wanna have the perfect house
I wanna aford the perfect Tv set
i wanna look like Doris Day
--- Unknown ---
I wanna man to cherish me
I wanna man whos organized
I wanna man who listens when I say
Now listen to me baby
--- Unknown ---
(Uh oh)
I don't wanna miss a thing (no)
I don't wanna miss the bus (whoa)
I want the american dream
And together we will grab it
And together we will sing
--- Unknown ---
Nothings better than this
Nothings better than this
I don't wanna miss
I don't wanna miss no
