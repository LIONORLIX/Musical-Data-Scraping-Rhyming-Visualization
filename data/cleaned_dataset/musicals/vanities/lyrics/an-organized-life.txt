------ An Organized Life ------
--- Unknown ---
Everything in life depends on good preperation
Cheerlearders need to live up to demands
If we're not afective then we have to work harder
Know our routines like the back of our hands
We need to drill them all
So that the job gets done
We need to run these cheers
So we can cheer each one
We need to rouse the crowd
But never crowd the team
And then the team will love us
And the crowd will cheer us
And the world will know
We're as perfect as we seem

Hey you gotta organize friday evening
You got your varsity game of football
You gotta stair on the sidelines
Helping them win
--- Unknown ---
Then we'll go with our guys to some perfecrt setting
Finish them out with a little petting
And that's how you begin to have an organized life
--- Unknown ---
Now we got to decide the theme for the football dance
It's less than a mile away
Themes for the football dance are always so corney
Well I was thinking about over the rainbow
I think that sounds more like the prom
ShouldnIt the football dance have something to do with football
--- Unknown ---
Yes now I'm sorry but I know what I'm doing
Over the rainbow is what it will be
I don't know I sorta think we need something better
Well over the rainbow sounds perfect to me
We'll need some big balloons
No I think balloons are squear maybe
We'll decorate the gym in lots of colors
I know what shoes I'll wear... what are you gunna wear?
I'll buy a tight nit dress
I'll get a new hair style
I'll make a big huge rainbow and use chicken wire
And stuff it full of tisue colored by the mile
--- Unknown ---
And we'll have an organized night of dancing
We'll have our over the rainbow outfits
Be in charge of the punch bowl
Starting the trends
We'll be girls to the rest of the mires
Some planing and chicken wire
We're 3 best friends live an organized organized life
--- Unknown ---
Life is full of drama
Life is full of dreams and promises
But its up to you to make it through and pass each test
You can make it
--- Unknown ---
I know we can run this house show
So simply follow me
And we can be the best
--- Unknown ---
Now when the dance is done they pick the football queen
I really hope its you
I'm sure you get it marry
I don't know what you mean
I hope you get it
No I hope it's you
Now come on
If not I'll slit my throught
There's only one thing certain
One of us will get it
But to just make certain
We should maybe fix the vote and so we need to organize all of our boyfriends
We need to infulence all of there team mates
We need to through them a party
That's how this goes
Since we know that the team controls all the inputing
Nothing is wrong with some self promoting
Let's just go to those who have an organized organized life
--- Unknown ---
So now we have an organized plan of action
Most organized to our advantage
Taking charge of our class mates
Pulling some strings
Popularity's yours if you go and win it
Power begins with how you get it
And preparation wins when you have an organized life
Take care of little things
You'll have an organized
