------ Cute Boys With Short Haircuts ------
--- Unknown ---
Seems like one of those "where did I go wrong?" days
Cant stop crying and I guess I'm not so strong days
Lost the only guy I ever had
It's been one of those seems like I've been scared years
Cant get out of bed and life is kinda hard years
No one ever made me feel so sad
--- Unknown ---
Now all I see are cute boys
With short haircuts walking by in a blur
And all I see is him and me
The way we always were
Thats how it goes when cute boys with short haircuts
Set your senses astir
He says he's true and ditches you for her
--- Unknown ---
When you find a man you don't wanna share him
But there's someone always thinking she can spare him
Laying out the perfect little trap
You can play it safe sure you got a smart plan
Soon it's just another love can fall apart plan
Guess sometimes we all could use a map
Just stear us through
--- Unknown ---
The cute boys with short haircuts
In a maze of their own
And here I am a little lamb so lost and all alone
--- Unknown ---
Out numbered by the cute boys with short haircuts
Sitting high on some thrown
I'm here below unseen and so unknown
--- Unknown ---
There was a time when everyone would notice me
Before whatever strength I had was gone
I want the things to be the way they used to be
But nothing stops the world from moving on
--- Unknown ---
And nothing stops the cute boys with short haircuts
Who surround me each day
Not so grand we're in demand
But pretty like they say
Not pretty like the cute boys with short haircuts
With the games that they play
The games of all the cute boys with broud shoulders
Lovin' all they survey and loving all these cute boys
With low voices and no morals and no interest
--- Unknown ---
Cute boys with short haircuts
Never looking my way
So here I sit and thats how it will stay
Thanks to shaterd trust and some slight disgust
no more cute boys with short haircuts
And I guess thats just okay
