------ Friendship Isn't What It Used To Be ------
--- Unknown ---
Three pretty girls in a schoolyard
Playin' games and makin' noise
You would think they had been best friends forever
Talkin' algebra and boys
--- Unknown ---
They were each of them after the big brass ring
So they swore they'd never be apart
And if it rang a little false...
Still, it was said with all their heart
--- Unknown ---
Laughing, dancing,
Off on a spree!
No one knew that none of it meant a thing...
But friendship isn't what it used to be
--- Unknown ---
Three college girls at the movies
Falling hard for Steve McQueen
You would think that they had so much in common
If you stumbled on the scene
--- Unknown ---
Then you peel back the layers of teenage ties
And a lot of what they shared is gone
We left each other far behind
And never noticed we moved on
--- Unknown ---
Life flows, time flies
Spirits roam free
No one says it and nothing dies
But friendship isn't what it used to be
--- Unknown ---
Wouldnt you know some of us grow
Some of us stay the way we are
And love burns out after making it so far
--- Unknown ---
Three women stuck at a crossroads,
At a loss to reconnect...
You would think them a mess of contradictions,
And for once you'd be correct
--- Unknown ---
It's apparent that none of us made the grade
But at least not in the way we planned
But how we lost our common ground
Is what I'll never understand
--- Unknown ---
Years race, lives change,
Makes sense to me...
Why the hell should it feel so strange?
All relationships rearranged!
And the fact is, some friends don't fade
Some... You never see.
--- Unknown ---
Make your peace with the choices made,
Swallow hard at the price you've paid...
--- Unknown ---
But friendship...
