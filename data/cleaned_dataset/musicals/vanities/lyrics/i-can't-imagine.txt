------ I Can't Imagine ------
--- Unknown ---
I can't stand the idea of a new school with new people
What if they all hate us
I'd die
What if Gary, Jim and Ted don't wanna go with us
I would just die
What if we don't get in the same sorority
Oh my god I would really die
--- Unknown ---
Since we started senior year
Theres one thing on my mind
What happens when the tree of us leave high school far behind
--- Unknown ---
What if I don't get admited but both of you do
What if all the got left is a dorm room for two
I would not get by no I think I would die
If I can't share collage with you
I can't imagine I can't imagine
Not having both of you there at my side
I can't imagine no I cant imagine
Not being with you the rest of the ride
Yes I know I still have Ted who's in my head and heart
But you are the most important thing in my life
I can't imagine us ever being apart
--- Unknown ---
Maybe Jim and I will live together
You can't do that it's not right
Besides the collage won't let you
Freshman stay in the dorm
We got to have a plan
So much to think about sororities our boyfriends
--- Unknown ---
One thing just occurred to me
That fills me up with fear
What happens if that brend up there is still around next year
What if every girl is pretty and looks like a star
What if every girl has money and drives her own car
Can we play the game when its not the same as it is right here where we are
--- Unknown ---
I can't imagine I can't imagine
Not being popular part of that group
I can't imagine no I cant imagine
People won't love us whatever we do
--- Unknown ---
All life long we've been adored
Which makes me sort of proud
Cause that is the most important thing in this life
I can't imagine us being one of the crowd
--- Unknown ---
Right now we're fine right here we're great
Our world is how it's supposed to be
I keep in line my path is straight
As I hold both of you close to me
--- Unknown ---
Hurrying into the future
But not letting go of the past
Taking account of what matters and making it last
--- Unknown ---
Imagine where we are
Imagine what comes next
--- Unknown ---
I can't imagine uh huh I cant imagine
Everything's perfect the way it is here
I can't imagine no I cant imagine
How we will be In a year next year
Who we are the things we do
Took four years to maintain
Now this is the most important time in my life
I can't imagine oh I cant imagine
