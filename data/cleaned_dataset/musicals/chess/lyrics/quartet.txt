--- MOLOKOV ---
We wish, no must, make our disgust
at this abuse perfectly clear.
We're here for chess -- are the U.S.?

Our player's sporting attitude's beyond all praise,
as any neutral would attest

a player's fault --
We'll overlook their crude political assault
and under protest will proceed
--- MOLOKOV ---
We wish, no must, make our disgust
at this abuse perfectly clear
we're here for chess -- are the U.S.?
How can you make such a
claim?
--- MOLOKOV ---
--- Unknown ---
If your man's so sweet
Then why his fighting talk?
If he's not a cheat

Once he realized
There was no hope
Of your lot playing fair
How sad

Become like any other sport
A battleground for rival ideologies
To slug it out with glee

disgust
Of this compelling dispute
clear
Comes the ghastly suspicion
are the U.S.?
My opposition's a fruit

I don't suppose
You'd understand the strain and pressure
getting where he's got
For then you'd simply call him
highly strung and not
Imply that he was one of those

Point 23
The board will be
Made in Sweden
Non-aligned wood

In short we rise
Above your guy's
Tantrums, dramas,
