--- FLORENCE ---
I would have thought in the average affair
That the first hint of trouble would be
Oh so small; barely perceptible, easy to miss
Why is ours on TV?
--- THE RUSSIAN ---
Listen -- you know as I do
Nothing's altered at all
I have no intention --
--- FLORENCE ---
Your personal life's
The lead on the news!
How do we ignore that?
--- THE RUSSIAN ---
I do and I must because otherwise I say
Goodbye to my hopes of retaining my title
If I should succumb to emotional blackmail I'm done --
--- FLORENCE ---
Looking after number one!
--- THE RUSSIAN ---
What do you mean?
--- FLORENCE ---
I mean it's always I this and I that
What happened to us?
--- THE RUSSIAN ---
All that I'm saying is I must make certain
That nothing distracts me from chess
When I've won
Then I'll attend to the secondary things --
--- FLORENCE ---
Things like me I suppose!
--- THE RUSSIAN ---
No, no -- you're reacting
Exactly the way that they want
--- FLORENCE ---
It's the way I have to
If I feel concerned I can't put it off
And come back to it later
--- THE RUSSIAN ---
Well if you're determined to jump when they tell you
Then maybe it's best that you do it alone
Watch TV, read the papers, have the miserable time of your life
