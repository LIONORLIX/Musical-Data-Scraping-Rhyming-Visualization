--- THE AMERICAN ---
So you got what you want
What a nasty ambition!
Set me up, pull me down
Then exploit my condition
I should have guessed, woman
That if pressed, woman
You're on nobody's side but your own
And you're behaving
Like a mere woman
It's so clear, woman --
It's your sex!
Once they start getting old and getting worried
They let fly, take it out
On the one who supports them --
That's you I'm talking about
--- THE AMERICAN & FLORENCE ---
Who'd ever think it?
Such a squalid little ending
Watching you descending
Just as far as you can go
I'm learning things I didn't want to know
Who'd ever guess it?
This would be the situation --
One more observation --
How'd we ever get this far
Before you showed me what you really are?
--- FLORENCE ---
You'll be lost without me
To abuse like you're used to
--- THE AMERICAN ---
Go away!  Just get out!  Be someone else's parasite!
--- Unknown ---
I'm not the kind to be vindictive
Holding some childish grudge
How could I be?  I'm in the spotlight
Half of the world my judge
--- Unknown ---
All I demand is those I work for
Those I give all my skills
All my time and pain
Those that I entertain
Give me the same compassion in return
