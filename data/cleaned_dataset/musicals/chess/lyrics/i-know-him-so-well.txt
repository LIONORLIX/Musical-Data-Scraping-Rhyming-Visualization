------ I Know Him So Well ------
--- FLORENCE ---
Nothing is so good it lasts eternally
Perfect situations must go wrong
But this has never yet prevented me
Wanting far too much for far too long.
Looking back I could have played it differently
Won a few more moments who can tell
But it took time to understand the man
Now at least I know I know him well
--- FLORENCE ---
Wasn't it good?
Wasn't he fine?
Isn't it madness
He can't be mine?
--- SVETLANA ---
Oh so good
Oh so fine
--- Unknown ---
He can't be mine?
--- FLORENCE ---
But in the end he needs
A little bit more than me --
More security
--- SVETLANA ---
He needs his fantasy
And freedom
--- FLORENCE ---
I know him so well.
--- SVETLANA ---
No one in your life is with you constantly
No one is completely on your side
And though I move my world to be with him
Still the gap between us is too wide.
--- FLORENCE ---
--- Unknown ---
Looking back I could
Have played things
Some other way
--- SVETLANA ---
--- Unknown ---
Looking back I could
Have played it
Differently
--- Unknown ---
Learned about the man
Before I fell
--- FLORENCE ---
I was just a little
Careless maybe
--- SVETLANA ---
But I was
Ever so much
Younger then
Now at least
--- FLORENCE ---
Now at least
I know him well
--- BOTH ---
I know I know him well
--- SVETLANA ---
--- Unknown ---
Wasn't it good?
Wasn't he fine?
Isn't it madness
--- FLORENCE ---
--- Unknown ---
Oh so good
Oh so fine
--- BOTH ---
He won't be mine?
Didn't I know
How it would go?
If I knew from the start
Why am I falling apart?
--- SVETLANA ---
--- Unknown ---
Wasn't it good?
Wasn't he fine?
--- FLORENCE ---
--- Unknown ---
Isn't it madness
He won't be mine?
--- SVETLANA ---
He won't be mine?
--- FLORENCE ---
But in the end he needs a
Little bit more than me --
More security
--- SVETLANA ---
He needs his
Fantasy and freedom
--- FLORENCE ---
I know him so well
--- SVETLANA ---
It took time to understand him
--- BOTH ---
