------ Purple Hearted Soldiers ------
--- Unknown ---
(Nikki Pagniano - as - Delores)
--- PURPLE HEARTED SOLDIERS STANDING IN A ROW ---
WOUNDED IN A BATTLE OF LOVING LONG AGO
THEY LOVED SOMEONE UNTRUE, UNKIND
WHO DIDN'T LOVE THEM BACK
UNREQUITED LOVE IS A FORM OF AN ATTACK
--- Unknown ---
WASN'T I GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU
JUST WHAT DID I LACK
FOR ALL THE TIMES YOU SHOT ME DOWN
I ALWAYS TOOK YOU BACK
MY PURPLE HEAT MEANS I'VE SURVIVED
THOUGH COUNTLESS NIGHTS I'VE DIED
PURPLE HEARTED SOLDIERS
HAVE LOVED AND LOST AND CRIED
LOVED AND LOST AND CRIED
--- YOU SAID THAT I WAS WONDERFUL ---
YOU SAID THAT I WAS WISE
YOU SAID YOU LOVED TO GAZE INTO
THE GALLERIES OF MY EYES
YOU SAID I TREATED YOU
THE WAY A LOVER ALWAYS SHOULD
YET YOU WOULDN'T LOVE ME
THE WAY A LOVER SHOULD
--- LOVING SOMEONE COST TOO MUCH ---
YOU PAY IT BACK IN PAIN
FOR ALL THE OATHS AND ALL THE VOWS
WON'T KEEP YOUR LOVER CHAINED
IT'S BETTER TO HAVE LOVED AND LOST
THAN NEVER LOVED AT ALL
THOSE WORDS WERE WRITTEN BY SOME SAGE
WHO NEVER TOOK THE FALL
--- ALL OF US HAVE TRIED TO LOVE ---
MOST OF US HAVE LOST
SOME TIMES WE'RE THE VICTIM
SOME TIMES WE'RE THE COST
LOVE COSTS --------------------------------------------------------
