WE'RE TAKING CHANCES
TO CHANGE SOME CONCEPTS
AND GIVE THE WORLD A CHANCE
TO CHANGE IT'S ATTITUDE
WE'LL USE SOME COSTUMES, SETS & LIGHTS
TO GIVE THE MOOD
AND CHANGE THE WAY IN WHICH
THESES BEAUTIES HAVE BEEN VIEWED
--- MONIQUE ---
--- WHAT IS TRUE BEAUTY ---
WHAT'S TRULY LOVELY
IS THE SEED OF PRIDE WE NOURISH DEEP INSIDE
TO BE HAPPY WITH OURSELVES AND NEVER HIDE
AND SEIZE THE MOMENT WHEN IT COMES
TO TURN THE TIDE
--- GIRLS ---
--- Unknown ---
SOME HOW THIS STILL DOESN'T SEEM REAL
HALF THE WORLD THINKS WE'VE NO SEX APPEAL
RUDE REMARKS ARE THE USUAL DEAL
WILL THIS SHOW CHANGE HOW ANYONE FEELS
--- CARTER ---
--- Unknown ---
WE'RE TAKING CHANCES
TO CHANGE A CONCEPT
WE'D LIKE TO GIVE THE WORLD ANOTHER CHANCE TO SEE
OTHER IMAGES OF FEMININITY
AND SEIZE THE MOMENT TO BE ALL THAT WE CAN BE
--- MONIQUE ---
--- AS I LAY MY CAREER ON THE LINE ---
ALL MY DOUBTS AND THE FEARS UNDERMINE
ALL THE WORK AND THE STRAIN AND THE GRIND
CAN I REALLY CHANGE ANY ONES MIND
--- CARTER ---
--- Unknown ---
THEY'VE ALL BEEN DAMSELS
IN REAL DISTRESS
SOON EACH WILL BE A BEAUTY IN A GORGEOUS DRESS
--- COMPANY ---
--- OPEN YOUR HEARTS ---
OPEN YOUR MINDS

WE'RE TAKING CHANCES
TO CHANGE CONCEPTIONS
TO SHOW YOU BEAUTY
IN MANY DIFFERENT SHAPES
