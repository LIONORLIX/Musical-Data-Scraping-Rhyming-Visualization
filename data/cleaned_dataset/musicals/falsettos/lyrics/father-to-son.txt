------ Father to Son ------
--- JASON ---
My father says that love
Is the most beautiful thing in the world.
I think girls are,
I think girls are the most
Beautiful thing,
Not love.
--- MARVIN ---
Kid, be my son.
What I've done to you is rotten.
Say I was scared.
I kept marching in one place,
Marching in time
To a tune I'd forgotten.
--- Unknown ---
I loved you, I love you.
I meant no disgrace.
This here is love,
When we're talking
Face to face.
--- Unknown ---
Father to son,
I, for one, would take love slower.
I've made my choice,
But you can sing a different song.
Watch as you sing,
How your voice gets much lower.
--- Unknown ---
You'll be, kid, a man, kid,
If nothing goes wrong.
Sing for yourself
As we march
Along.
--- Unknown ---
A man, kid, you'll be, kid,
Whatever the song.
Sing for yourself
As we march
