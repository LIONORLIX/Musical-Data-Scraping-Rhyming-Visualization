MARVIN: Whizzer, kid, you're looking very good today.
You had to see yourself a few days back,
I had a heart attack!
Jesus'
But today you seem to be
On the way to recovery!
Oh, Whizzer, I want to applaud!
It's days like this I almost believe in God,
Days like this I almost believe
In God.

In a kosher morass!
For aches and croup,
Try my chicken soup!

But since I'm parking in the city, I've improved,
