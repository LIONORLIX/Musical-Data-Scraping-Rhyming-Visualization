------ A Marriage Proposal ------
--- Unknown ---
JASON: (speaking) This is how you make a marriage proposal.
--- Unknown ---
MENDEL: (singing)
I love you dear.
I think you're swell.
You're never near me close enough to tell
If I'm delightful or not.
--- Unknown ---
I need your wrist.
I praise your thigh.
There's not a guy,
There's not a piece of paper,
There's not a man in pants
Who could love you the same as I!
--- Unknown ---
Oftentimes, lovers are crazy people.
Sometimes they kill each other.
Just like a biblical brother
Did to his biblical brother
Back in biblical times.
--- Unknown ---
TRINA: Biblical times?
--- Unknown ---
MARVIN: (speaking) Biblical times?
--- Unknown ---
MENDEL: Uh, biblical times. (singing) Oh, those' biblical times!
--- Unknown ---
I love your eyes.
I love your face.
I want you by my side to take my place
If I get sick or detained.
--- Unknown ---
Don't brush your hair, you?re perfect.
Don't start to cry.
There's not a guy,
There's not a horse or zebra,
There's not a giant man
Who could love you the same as I!
--- Unknown ---
Forget that giant man,
He won't love you the same as I!
I'm not a giant man,
But I'll love you until,
Love you until,
