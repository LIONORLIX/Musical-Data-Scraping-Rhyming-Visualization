WHIZZER: Late for dinner, late again
--- WHIZZER, MARVIN, AND TRINA ---
Late for dinner, late again
Late for dinner, late again
Late for dinner, late, late, late, late
MARVIN:
Whizzer's supposed to always be here
Make the dinner, set to screw
That's what pretty boys should do
Check their hairlines, make the dinner
And love me
--- Unknown ---
This is going nowhere and fast, Whizzer
This little thing that we have will not last
Don't feel responsible, after all it's through
--- Unknown ---
WHIZZER: I'm not responsible
--- MARVIN ---
Life can be wonderful
Isn't this wonderful?
And this had better come to a stop, Whizzer
Now, Whizzer, ciao Whizzer, bend
This had better come to an end
--- TRINA ---
I was supposed to make the dinner
Make it pretty on his plate
Every wife should pull her weight
Have it ready, make it tasty
And love him
--- Unknown ---
This had better come to a stop doctor
This has been a lousy and horrible flop
--- Unknown ---
MENDEL: Don't feel responsible, after all it's through

Don't ask me questions!
I'm frightened of questions
But grateful that it's come to a stop, Trina
Smile, Trina, I'll help you mend
--- WHIZZER AND TRINA ---

Brains or money?

WHIZZER AND TRNA: This is all very smart

This had better come to a stop, Mendel
Don't touch me, don't condescend
This had better come
This had better come to a
This, this, this, this
This had better come to an end

Chop, chop, chop, chop, chop
I chopped it and served his food
The asshole forced me

WHIZZER: Why is it always ourselves who have to change?
--- Unknown ---
MARVIN: This is incredibly boring
--- WHIZZER, TRINA, MENDEL, AND JASON ---
You've got a temper that redefines temper
And this had better come to a stop, Marvin
Now, Marvin, ciao Marvin, bend
This had better come
This had better come to a
This, this, this
This had better come to an end
--- Unknown ---
MARVIN: This had better come to an end
