------ Marvin Goes Crazy ------
--- MARVIN ---
Hello, Trina, thank you for coming here
Goodness, Trina, I am relieved
Frankly, Trina, nice of you coming here
Thank you, Trina, I have received
Your new-sent wedding invitations!
They are
--- MARVIN, WHIZZER, MENDEL, AND JASON ---
Pseudo-romantic and sick!
MARVIN
You say you'll
--- MARVIN, WHIZZER, MENDEL, AND JASON ---
Love him until you both die!
--- MARVIN ---
You die on
--- MARVIN, WHIZZER, MENDEL, AND JASON ---
May 27th at eight!
--- WHIZZER ---
He has lost his mind
Marvin is not so uncouth
Marvin is not so unkind
--- TRINA ---
Mendel plans to rub my back
Mendel?s not a maniac
And he's sweet
And he's warm
And he loves me so
--- MARVIN ---
Tell me, Trina, what was the impetus?
Sorry, Trina, look in my eyes
Really, Trina, this is ridiculous
Jesus, Trina, how I despise
Your need for stupid conversation!
--- MARVIN ---
You are
--- MARVIN, WHIZZER, MENDEL, AND JASON ---
Trying to ruin my sleep!
--- MARVIN ---
I'm sure you
--- MARVIN, WHIZZER, MENDEL, AND JASON ---
Chose him to make me look bad!
--- MARVIN ---
How could you
--- MARVIN, WHIZZER, MENDEL, AND JASON ---
Ever deny what we had?
--- TRINA AND WHIZZER ---
We had fights and games
Marvin called us funny names
Marvin always played the clown
--- MENDEL ---
Marvin acts like he's untrained
Marvin, I am so ashamed
--- TRINA AND WHIZZER ---
And he's sweet
And he's mean
--- WHIZZER ---
Do I love him?
No
--- MARVIN ---
I am so dumb
--- WHIZZER, TRINA, MENDEL, AND JASON ---
Dumb
Dumb
Dumb!
Dumb!
--- MARVIN ---
