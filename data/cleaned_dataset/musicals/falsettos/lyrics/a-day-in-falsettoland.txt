CAROLINE: You go out on the streets,
And there are all these people asking for a handout!
You go home, you open up your mail,
And it's full of people asking for a donation!
And you turn on the TV and they want money for starving children in Ethiopia!
I just want to be left alone!
--- Unknown ---
MENDEL: (overlapping) (singing)
I don't get it! I don't understand!
In the 60s, everyone had heart.
In the 60s, we were all a part of the same team.
In the 60s, we had a new world to start!
Could this- oh God, don't say this-
Could this be the new world we started'
Here I sit, brokenhearted and-
--- Unknown ---
CAROLINE: (speaking) Do I wait for the promotion, or do I take this IBM job'
--- Unknown ---
MENDEL: Yeah, well, Caroline' Hmm.
(singing) I don't get it!
I've been left behind,
Half my patients, yuppie pagans
Modeled on the Ronald Reagans!
Now the world is too pathetic,
And I don't get it at all!
--- Unknown ---
CAROLINE: (speaking) Oh, I'm in a deep quandary about my career. What do you think I should do'
--- Unknown ---
MENDEL: Time's up.
--- Unknown ---
CAROLINE: Awww.
--- Unknown ---
MENDEL: (singing) At least there's Trina at home,
Trina in bed, Trina obsessing and sort of caressing
My head with her feet.
I once thought it was sweet,
But I don't anymore.
Now I just snore,
--- Unknown ---
Cause I'm so exhausted,
Listening as those yuppie farts complain,
Listening as their shallow hearts explain
Their lives.
--- Unknown ---
CHARLOTTE: (speaking) Trina Works It Out.
--- Unknown ---
TRINA: (singing) Marvin's back with Whizzer,
Just like how it was.
If I don't like Whizzer,
It's because my ex sure does.
--- Unknown ---
Why should that affect me'
Sometimes I'm a lout.
Mendel serenades and Jason calms me.
Why should I be wilting
When their precious love is not in doubt'
Work it out!
--- Unknown ---
JASON: The Neighbors Relax!

I don't get it. Why don't you let go'

CHARLOTTE: It was wonderful.
For the first time in months, nobody died.
There were just heart attacks and gallstones,
Light bulbs up the ass,
Fake appendicitis, which is gas,
Which I diagnosed. People overdosed
And I saved them.

I save the young people, old people,
One priest and one high school principal!
Saving lives, I feel invincible!
