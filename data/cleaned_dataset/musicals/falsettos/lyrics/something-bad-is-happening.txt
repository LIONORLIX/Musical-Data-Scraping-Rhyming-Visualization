------ Something Bad Is Happening ------
--- CHARLOTTE ---
People might think I'm very dykish.
I make a big stink when I must, but goddamn!
I'm just professional, never too nonchalant.
If I'm a bitch, well, I am what I am!
--- Unknown ---
Just call me 'Doc', don't call me 'lady'.
I don't like to talk when I'm losing the game.
Bachelors arrive sick and frightened.
They leave weeks later unenlightened.
We see a trend, but the trend has no name.
--- Unknown ---
Something bad is happening.
Something very bad is happening.
Something stinks, something immoral.
Something so bad that words have lost their meaning!
Rumors fly and tales abound,
Stories echo underground!
Something bad
Is spreading, spreading, spreading
'Round!

She's my doctor,
And I love her!
She's got passion!
She's intelligent and, Jesus Christ,
A doctor!
Very wealthy,
And I love her!
Doctor of internal medicine!
I'm sorry that you're queasy.

CORDELIA: She's my doctor and I love her! She's got heart!
--- Unknown ---
CHARLOTTE: (overlapping)
I scan the mag, very chic tabloid.
The men dressed in drag, next to their moms.
Fashion and passion and filler,
But not a word about the killer.
I like the ballgowns, but Jesus Christ!
