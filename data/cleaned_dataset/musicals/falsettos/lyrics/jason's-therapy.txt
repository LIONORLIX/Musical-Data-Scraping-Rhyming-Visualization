JASON'S THERAPY LYRICS
JASON
Mr. Mendel
I get apoplexy thinking of my father
I resemble him in far too many ways
His sad demeanor
The way he acts the swine
At least his room is cleaner than mine
Is it fatal?
Do you see real similarities between us?
He and Whizzer live like...
Well, I think it's clear
What do I do?
What do I say?
How do I ask?
What do I hope for?
Is it my mind?
Love isn't free
If love isn't blind
What do I see?
--- MENDEL ---
Stop!
Look around you
No one's screaming at you
So you feel alright for about ten minutes
If you feel alright for about ten minutes
Why don't you feel alright for about twenty minutes?
Feel alright for about forty minutes?
Drop it and smile
--- Unknown ---
Why don't you feel alright for the rest of your life?
Why don't you feel alright for the rest of your life?
Why don't you feel alright for the rest of your life?
--- JASON ---
Is this therapy?
--- TRINA ---
Chop chop chop chop chop
I chopped it
It's a gourmet version of chicken merengo
Took me all day
I'll say 'twas worth the time
I lie
--- MARVIN ---
Why is he always here?
--- WHIZZER ---
The psychiatrist returning
Returning
Five sessions later
--- MENDEL ---
Try to forget all things homely
Try to forget all things snide
Nothing's as good as you recall
Count what's good, then divide
--- Unknown ---
If you can count, it's alright
You can figure out the world
You can add and subtract at will
You can cover up the past
You can kill the pain
Very easily
--- JASON ---
Is this therapy?
--- MARVIN, TRINA, WHIZZER, AND MENDEL ---
Right, this is therapy!
--- JASON ---
So scram
Mr. Mendel
As regarding your intentions to my mother
Are they everything a woman would desire?
Her hand is ready
It only needs a ring
I'd buy confetti
And sing
I'm embarrassed
It's not my responsibility to ask you
But I wonder if it ever crossed your mind?
--- MENDEL ---
What do I say?
Where do I look?
Why do I laugh?
How do I answer?
Is it my mind?
Love isn't free
If love isn't blind
What do I see?
--- JASON ---
Stop!
Look around you
A lot of nice furniture
Someone's bringing you dinner
Someone brought you your lunch
Someone's washing your laundry
Washing your socks
Jesus Christ!
Why don't you feel alright for the rest of your life?
Why don't you feel alright for the rest of your life?

JASON/MENDEL
Why don't you/I feel alright for the rest of your/my life?
Whoo!
--- MARVIN, TRINA, WHIZZER, JASON, AND MENDEL ---
Why don't you feel alright for the rest of your life?
Why don't you feel alright for the rest of your life?
Why don't you feel alright for the rest of your life?
Feel, feel, feel, feel alright
Feel, feel, feel, feel alright
Feel, feel, feel, feel alright
Feel alright for the rest of your
Rest of your
