------ Jason's Bar Mitzvah ------
--- JASON ---
Whizzer, hey!
Suddenly it all came clear:
I said, let's have my bar mitzvah here!
--- MARVIN, TRINA, MENDEL, JASON, CHARLOTTE, CORDELIA ---
Surprise!
--- MARVIN ---
This was Jason's first-rate idea!
And I brought the prayer shall
--- MARVIN, TRINA, MENDEL, JASON, CHARLOTTE, CORDELIA ---
Ooo
It's Jason's bar mitzvah!
--- MENDEL ---
Don't you move
Everything will soon be great
Close your eyes
While we redecorate
--- CORDELIA ---
I'll unwrap the billion hors d'oeuvres
And someone, eat them, please
--- TRINA ---

--- ALL ---
Ooo
It's Jason's bar mitzvah!
--- TRINA ---
Lovely, flowers make things lovely
Champagne makes things lovely, too
Everything's amiss
--- MENDEL ---
Drink up!
Anyone for bubbly?
--- TRINA ---
Probably, it's doubly
Useful at a time like this
Cheers
--- MENDEL AND WHIZZER ---
Cheers
--- TRINA ---
And aren't things lovely?
I feel more helpless than I have in years
--- MARVIN ---
Try this on
Mendel, get this in gear
--- WHIZZER ---
Please excuse me
If I interfere
But I feel that, since I'm the host
It's me who should toast him
--- MARVIN, WHIZZER, TRINA, MENDEL, CHARLOTTE, CORDELIA ---
Ooo, ooo
--- WHIZZER ---
To Jason's bar mitzvah!
--- Unknown ---
(the men depart to help Jason get ready)
--- CHARLOTTE ---
I notified the nurses
Told them please to not intrude
--- CORDELIA ---
I passed around the food
And dumped some extra food
'Cause, Lord knows, we've got plenty
--- CHARLOTTE ---
She's cooked for some 200 guests
--- CORDELIA ---
We number not that many
Actually..., we're seven
--- CHARLOTTE ---
Maybe it's not dumb
The way this whole thing ends
The food tastes really yummy
--- TRINA ---
It does
--- CORDELIA ---
Oh, mummy
--- TRINA ---
Lovely
--- CHARLOTTE AND CORDELIA ---
The flowers seem to sparkle
The candelabra sets the tone
--- TRINA ---
I must make things
--- CHARLOTTE AND CORDELIA ---
The wine is very soothing
--- TRINA ---
Lovely
--- CHARLOTTE AND CORDELIA ---
Soothes the something, something
Someone needed soothing
--- TRINA ---
Put everything
--- CHARLOTTE ---
I think, perhaps, I'm overdressed
--- TRINA ---
In its place
--- CORDELIA ---
I think, perhaps, it doesn't matter
--- TRINA ---
Ready for the
--- CORDELIA ---
That you are
--- TRINA ---
Band
--- CHARLOTTE AND CORDELIA ---
Here we are
Jason's bar mitzvah looks
Like the books
Say it should
--- TRINA, CHARLOTTE, AND CORDELIA ---
Cheers
--- TRINA ---
And aren't things lovely?
--- CHARLOTTE AND CORDELIA ---
Everything is lovely
--- TRINA, CHARLOTTE, AND CORDELIA ---
I feel more helpless than I have in years

(Whizzer and Mendel enter, followed by Marvin and Jason)
--- MENDEL AND WHIZZER ---
Here he comes
--- MENDEL ---
Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun
Fix his tie
Trina, try
To make him smile more
--- WHIZZER, TRINA, MENDEL, CHARLOTTE, CORDELIA ---
Don't know why
But he looks like Marvin
--- MARVIN ---
How did you turn out so great?
Who do I thank for the man you've turned into?
Kid, do you know
How proud I am?
If I don't show
How proud I am...
You hold my dreams
Kid, I burst at the seams
'Cause of you
--- MENDEL ---
Son of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob
Son of Marvin, Son of Trina, Son of Whizzer, Son of Mendel
--- MARVIN, WHIZZER, TRINA, JASON, CHARLOTTE, CORDELIA ---
And godchild to the lesbians from next door
--- MENDEL ---
Sing
Oh, sing
Oh, sing
--- JASON ---
Vie-eme-low yea-o-leh
Heh-oh-non vi-low
Ah-yis-is-ooh ay-ysi-ro-ale
