------ I Never Wanted to Love You ------
--- TRINA ---
I never wanted to love you.
I only wanted to love and not be blamed.
Let me go, you should know
I'm not ashamed
To have loved you.
--- MENDEL ---
I loved you more than I meant to.
In my profession, one's love stays unexpressed.
Here we stand, take my hand.
God, I'm distressed.
How I love you.

I never wanted to love you.
I never wanted, 'till death do we two part.'
Condescend, stay my friend.
How do I start,
Not to love you'
--- TRINA ---
I'm everything he wanted.
It's time I put it all together.
My hands were tied.
My father cried,
'You'll marry!'
I married!

TRINA & JASON: (overlapping) He's mine! He's mine!

I never wanted to love you.
I only wanted to see my face in yours.
Jason smiled, save this child.
How he adores, and hates me-
--- Unknown ---
It really killed me when you took those vows.
Don't misunderstand, I'm in command!
Anyhow, we're through!
I never wanted,
I wanted-
I never, never, never, never,
Never, never wanted to love you!
I never wanted to love you!
I never wanted to love you!
I never wanted to love you!
