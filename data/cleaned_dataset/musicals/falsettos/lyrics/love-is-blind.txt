------ Love is Blind ------
--- MENDEL ---
Sit down, my dear
I hear you have a problem
I'm sure you're not disgusting or indiscreet
Take a load off your feet-
--- TRINA ---
Love is a mess
So's my son, expressly to hurt me
Marvin, my ex-
You've seen him for years-
Told me over the phone to tell you my fears
Do you only treat queers?
--- MENDEL ---
Breathe deep, my dear
You'll find me understanding
Your pain is a priori
Unfold you untold story
Now to break bread
Loosen your glands
Put your head in my hands
--- TRINA ---
I'm everything he wanted
It's time I put it all together
The date was set
My father let my marry
I married. I?
Then Marvin came from work
Sat me down on the bed
He told me how he loved me
How needed, that thought valued me
I have?

MENDEL: My name is Mendel
I treat her husband
I think she's very insecure
But so am I
I've never married
Work, work is my passion
Or perhaps that's an alibi
--- Unknown ---
(speak) I don't care to discuss it.
--- Unknown ---
(sing) I think she's charming
I think she's eager
That's unprofessional and mean
But still it's true
--- Unknown ---
ALL: His name is Mendel
--- Unknown ---
WHIZZER: Ah-ah
