------ What Would I Do? ------
--- Unknown ---
MARVIN (left alone): What would I do
If I had not met you?
Who would I blame my life on?
Once I was told
That all men get what they deserve.
Who the hell then threw this curve?
There are no answers.
But who would I be
If you had not been my friend?
--- Unknown ---
You're the only one,
One out of a thousand others,
Only one my child would allow.
When I'm having fun,
You're the one I wanna talk to.
Where have you been?
Where are you now?
--- Unknown ---
(WHIZZER appears behind MARVIN, dressed as we first saw him.
MARVIN turns around, sees WHIZZER and catches his breath.)
--- Unknown ---
What would I do
If I had not loved you?
How would I know what love is?
God only knows, too soon
I'll remember your faults.
Meanwhile, though, it's tears and schmaltz.
--- Unknown ---
There are no answers.
But what would I do
If you had not been my friend?
--- WHIZZER ---
All your life you've wanted men,
And when you got it up to have them,
Who knew it could end your life?
--- MARVIN ---
I left my kid and left my wife
To be with you,
To be insulted by such handsome men.
--- Unknown ---
(They face each other.)
--- Unknown ---
WHIZZER: Do you regret--?
--- MARVIN (stopping him) ---
I'd do it again.
I'd like to believe that I'd do it again
And again and again...
And
What more can I say?
--- Unknown ---
WHIZZER: What more can I say?
--- Unknown ---
MARVIN: How am I to face tomorrow?
--- Unknown ---
BOTH: After being screwed out of today. Tell me what's in store.
--- Unknown ---
MARVIN: Yes, I'd beg or steal or borrow
If I could hold you for
One hour more.
--- Unknown ---
WHIZZER: One hour more.
--- Unknown ---
MARVIN: One hour more.
--- Unknown ---
WHIZZER: One hour more.
--- Unknown ---
BOTH: One hour, one hour more.
--- Unknown ---
MARVIN: What would I do
--- Unknown ---
WHIZZER: What would I do
--- Unknown ---
MARVIN: If I had not seen you?
--- Unknown ---
WHIZZER: If I had not seen you?
--- Unknown ---
BOTH: Who would I feast my eyes on?
Once I was told
That good men get better with age.
--- Unknown ---
MARVIN: Were just gonna skip that stage.
--- Unknown ---
There are no answers.
But what would I do
If you hadn't been my friend?
--- Unknown ---
WHIZZER: There are no answers. But what would I do...
--- Unknown ---
(WHIZZER exits)
--- Unknown ---
MARVIN: No simple answers.
But what would I do
If you had not been
My friend. My friend. My friend.
--- Unknown ---
(First JASON, then everyone else gathers around MARVIN.)
--- Unknown ---
MENDEL: Homosexuals.
Women with children.
Short insomniacs.
We're a teeny tiny band.
Lovers come and lovers go.
Lovers live and die fortissimo.
This is where we take a stand.
Welcome to Falsettoland.

(DR. CHARLOTTE walks in and joins the circle at the same time as MENDEL. TRINA consoles MARVIN.)
