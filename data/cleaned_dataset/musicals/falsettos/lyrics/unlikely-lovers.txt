One old horny lover

Slap my face or hold me till winter
Oh, baby, please do
I love you too
My lover

Marvin, just go home and turn on TV
Drink a little something till you're 'dead'
Think of me around
Sleeping soundly in our bed
Marvin, did you hear what I said?

Shut your mouth, go to sleep
Time I met a sailor
Are you sleeping yet or...?

Let's be scared together
Let's pretend that nothing is awful
