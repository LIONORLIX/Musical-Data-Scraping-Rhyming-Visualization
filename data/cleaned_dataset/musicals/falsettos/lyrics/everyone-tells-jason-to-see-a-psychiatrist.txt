------ Everyone Tells Jason to See a Psychiatrist ------
--- TRINA ---
Darling, please see a psychiatrist.
He doesn't bite, and he might
Help you understand
Why you are so angry and despised
By all those guys
Who have not been, they have not been analyzed.

Yet, sweetheart, please do not get hysterical.
Reason will win the day, trust me!
Mother never lies.
No one is saying you're a sick neurotic,
But you could find some help.
Hear me out, please.
Yes, you could find some help,
He could help you realize

Make no commotions.
