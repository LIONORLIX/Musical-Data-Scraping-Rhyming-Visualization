And somebody called?

Norma
There he is, the Count! And he's Mr. Tod, the Count's former lover, you
know? You want the truth, ask the count!

Sal
You ask him...
--- Unknown ---
Norma
I already know the answer.
--- Unknown ---
Sal
Norma!
--- Unknown ---
Norma
Are you King's lover?
--- Unknown ---
King
I love him very much!
--- Unknown ---
Norma
Oh, God!
--- Unknown ---
Sal
I'm gonna throw up!
Here, sign this... Since that I don't like being in business with homos,
I'm buying you out!
--- Unknown ---
Victoria
Oh, darling, don't do it!
--- Unknown ---
King
Ok, sweetheart!

Sal
Jesus, King, That's disgusting!

Victoria
[Pushing Norma]
That's it!

Norma
Take your hands off me!

Victoria
Go on, go on upstairs on the bed!

Norma
Wait! Lock the door...

Victor
I've got a surprise for you...Dah daaah!
--- Unknown ---
Norma
[Screams]
You no good two-timing son of a bitch...He's a woman!
--- Unknown ---
Victor
Yes, yes
Yes...
The more I leer
The more I seek
The more I find
The more I care
The more the world is kind
One thing I can tell you
Life should be your lover
Help you to discover your reason for being
Soon you will be seeing
What you're all about
Living in the shadows
You'll never find out
Push away the shadows
