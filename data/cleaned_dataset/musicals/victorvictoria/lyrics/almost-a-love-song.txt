------ Almost a Love Song ------
--- Unknown ---
Victor
So, what do we do?
--- Unknown ---
King
You want me to be honest?
--- Unknown ---
Victor
Always!
--- Unknown ---
King
I could never live with you this way.
--- Unknown ---
Victor
Because you are frightened that people will think that you're in love
with a man?
--- Unknown ---
King
Right!
--- Unknown ---
Victoria
So we have a problem...
--- Unknown ---
King
I guess we have!
--- Unknown ---
Victoria
What we have here is almost a love song.
I'm perfect for you , you're perfect for me.
Ev'rything they sing about we have in profusion;
The same sense of humor, a romance more than mere illusion.
--- Unknown ---
King
So why are we almost a love song?
Why aren't we the song of the year? Does the moment go by?
--- Unknown ---
Victoria
Are we frightened to try?
--- Unknown ---
King
If we are, more's the pity,
--- Unknown ---
Victoria
For the idea seems so pretty...to be almost a love song.
--- Unknown ---
King
You owe me a love song.
--- Unknown ---
Both
So where is my love song, my dear?
--- Unknown ---
Victoria
Seriously, maybe it's for the best, sooner or
later I'd probably ask you to stop being a gangster,
because I was worried about everybody thinking that
I was your mole.
--- Unknown ---
King
I'm not a gangster, I'm a businessman!
--- Unknown ---
Victoria
A business doing business with gangsters claiming
he's not a gangster; sounds a lot like the kind of
act I do! I think we're both pretenders and I guess
this is not a really good basis for a relationship,
but it was fine while it lasted...

King
One thing's clear here:
--- Unknown ---
Victoria
It's clear
--- Unknown ---
King
We're almost a love song.
--- Unknown ---
Victoria
We're almost a love song.
--- Unknown ---
King
She's so good for me,
--- Unknown ---
Victoria
I'm no good for him,
--- Unknown ---
King
I'm no good for her.
--- Unknown ---
Victoria
He's so good for me...I imagined somebody...
--- Unknown ---
King
I saw someone...
--- Unknown ---
Victoria
Who looks at things my way.
--- Unknown ---
King
We'll travel life's highway.
--- Unknown ---
Victoria
Whatever the weather,
--- Unknown ---
King
But I wonder whether
--- Unknown ---
Both
The two of us should be together.
--- Unknown ---
Victoria
So, why are we almost a love song,
--- Unknown ---
King
Are we a love song?
--- Unknown ---
Victoria
Instead of the song of the year?
--- Unknown ---
King
Not a good one, I fear ... Will the moment go by?
--- Unknown ---
Victoria
Will I lose him? Are we frightened to try?
--- Unknown ---
King
Mustn't lose her...if I do...
--- Unknown ---
Victor
If we are...
--- Unknown ---
Both
Then it's tragic; he and I have too much magic
--- Unknown ---
Victoria
Then it's tragic; she and I have too much magic.
--- Unknown ---
Both
To be almost a love song ...
--- Unknown ---
King
Hell, I might as well face it.
--- Unknown ---
Victoria
You owe me a love song...
--- Unknown ---
King
I could never replace it.
--- Unknown ---
Victoria
So, where is our love song, my dear?
--- Unknown ---
King
