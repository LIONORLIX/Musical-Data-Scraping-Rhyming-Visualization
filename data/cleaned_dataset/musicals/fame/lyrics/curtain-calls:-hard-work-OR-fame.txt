------ Curtain Calls: Hard Work / Fame ------
--- Unknown ---
I'm alive and I will survive
Show the world that I can take it
When I hit the heights
Put my name in lights
--- Unknown ---
Show the world that I can
Make it by doin'
doin', doin' doin'
By doin' hard work
--- Unknown ---
Baby look at me
And tell me what you see
You ain't seen the best of me yet
Give me time I'll make you forget the rest
--- Unknown ---
I got more in me
And you can set it free
I can catch the moon in my hands
Don't you know who I am
--- Unknown ---
Remember my name
Fame
--- Unknown ---
I'm gonna live forever
I'm gonna learn how to fly
High
--- Unknown ---
I feel it coming together
People will see me and cry
Fame
--- Unknown ---
I'm gonna make it to heaven
Light up the sky like a flame
Fame
--- Unknown ---
I'm gonna live forever
Baby remember my name
--- Unknown ---
Remember
Remember
Remember
Remember
Remember
Remember
Remember
