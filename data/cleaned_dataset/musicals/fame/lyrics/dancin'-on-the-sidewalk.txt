------ Dancin' on the Sidewalk ------
--- Unknown ---
Everyday, I'll wake up in the mornin'
Splash my face to keep myself from yawnin'
Get dressed and get my bones together
Open the window to check out the weather
--- Unknown ---
Then like I seen a ghost, man
I'll be movin' my feet
Just like the postman in the cold or the heat
No time to talk and I go dancin' on the sidewalk
--- Unknown ---
Dancin' on the sidewalk
Dancin' on the sidewalk
Dancin' on the sidewalk
--- Unknown ---
Lunchtime is music to my ears
I'm down on Wallstreet with all the financiers
South Street Seaport I am the action
The number one tourist attraction
--- Unknown ---
Hip hop to the West Side
Where I do myself proud
The West Side is the best side for drawin' a crowd
The cabbies squawk when I go dancin' on the sidewalk
--- Unknown ---
Dancin' on the sidewalk
Dancin' on the sidewalk
Dancin' on the sidewalk
--- Unknown ---
Dancin' on the sidewalk
Dancin' on the sidewalk
Dancin' on the sidewalk
--- Unknown ---
Uptown I do my boogaloo
Stoppin' traffic on Seventh Avenue
Nighttime the corner to be on
Times Square under the neon
--- Unknown ---
For my finale
I'll be doin' my thing
In Shubert Alley
They're gonna crown me the king
Of all New York
--- Unknown ---
Because I'm dancin', dancin', dancin' woo
Dancin' on the sidewalk
--- Unknown ---
Dancin' on the sidewalk
Dancin' on the sidewalk
Dancin' on the sidewalk
