------ Teacher's Argument ------
--- MISS BELL ---
Artists are special celestial fools
first with the talent for breaking the rules
unfit for confinement in cubicle schools
artists are special
--- MISS SHERMAN ---
Artists are people not primitive fools
they learn what to do before breaking the rules
they know that the brain is the finest of tools
artists are people
--- BOTH ---
Whether in theatre or music or dance
they have to be given the chance
--- MISS BELL ---
to fly by the seat of their pants
--- MISS SHERMAN ---
to develop their minds and be nurtured
--- BOTH ---
like plants
--- MISS SHERMAN ---
Artists are part of the same human race
as everyone else in the same bloody place
you learn to survive or you fall on your face
artist or not
artist or not

Greta, you know that 90% of these kids
will never make a living in the arts
we have to prepare them for life
or what's Tyrone gonna do if he can't make it as a dancer
mop floors?
--- MISS BELL ---
Tyrone will make it
--- Unknown ---
(sung)
I've seen them come and go for all these years
kids with no talent for anything more than carrying spears
another year another shipment
lacking the drive or the style or the basic eqipment
this one is different.
--- Unknown ---
And i can see me there unremarkable me
the kid in the ballet class
the princess i wanted to be
tutu and point shoes
hair in a bun
completely unnoticed as if i were no-one
--- Unknown ---
this one is different i tell you
this one can dance
this one is virtual i tell you
give him a chance
--- Unknown ---
(spoken)
Tyrone will make it, he will
--- MISS SHERMAN ---
Fine, and i wish him luck
but this is an academic institution with academic standards
Oh i know,
we're the fame high school now
ever since that movie came out
they come here expecting to become stars
and you people think you run the show here
oh teach them to perform and who cares if they can read or write
who needs to write anyway
as long as they can sign their name on a contract
--- MISS BELL ---
and who are you?
defender of the true faith
--- MISS SHERMAN ---
Exactly!
--- Unknown ---
(sung)
What did they tell me when i was a girl
Learn...
Day after day when i was a girl
Learn...
The land of dreams waits over the meadow
if you can find a way
out of the ghetto
learn, learn
put your faith in books
that will protect you
put your faith in books
and a mind of your own
neither charm or looks
will make them respect you
you must learn to stand
you must learn to stand alone
--- Unknown ---
picture a little girl
in glasses and brace
a little starch dress at the end of the corridor
shes holding to walk waiting for the bell ring
parying for the day to end
forcing herself to go back to her class again
hearing her mamas words
&#65533;put your faith in books&#65533;
--- MISS BELL ---
this one is different
--- MISS SHERMAN ---
put your faith in books
--- MISS BELL ---
this one can dance
--- MISS SHERMAN ---
put your faith in books
--- MISS BELL ---
artists are special
--- MISS SHERMAN ---
artists are people
--- BOTH ---
this one must have the chance
this one must have the chance.
