------ Let's Play a Love Scene (Reprise) ------
--- Unknown ---
You were the honest friend
I was the great pretender
I hid my feeling to the end
--- Unknown ---
Now I want to say
What it means to me
How I could ever be the same
Without you
--- Unknown ---
The way I know I really feel about you
The way I know I'll always feel about you
Why can't we
Why can't we
Why can't we try to play a love scene
--- Unknown ---
We don't need the violins to play a love scene
Where we see how love begins
Find a way to start and learn to play the part
A perfect scene from a play unknown
--- Unknown ---
Let's play a love scene
Let's play a love scene
We don't need the violins to play a love scene
Where we see how love begins
Find a way to start and learn to play the part
A perfect scene from a play unknown
--- Unknown ---
Let's play a
Let's play a
