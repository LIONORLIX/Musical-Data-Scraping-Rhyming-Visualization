This ain't no
Movie show
Playin' in the theater
Or a video
--- Unknown ---
Fantasy
I was always hot to see
On the T.V.
--- Unknown ---
I'm so hot, hot to trot
I can hardly wait to show them what I got
Wonder who'll come out shinin' like a jewel
In the 'Fame' school
--- Unknown ---
Here we are
So bizarre
This is where they show you
How to be a star
--- Unknown ---
I can't wait
I can't even concentrate
I just pulsate
--- Unknown ---
Class to class, try'n' to pass
Learnin' who the teachers are who bust your ass
Feelin' small, feeling up against the wall
During roll call
--- Unknown ---
I'm alive and I will survive
Show the world that I can take it
When I hit the heights
Put my name in lights
--- Unknown ---
Show the world that I can
Make it by doin'
doin', doin' doin'
By doin' hard work
--- Unknown ---
By doin' hard work
By doin' hard work
