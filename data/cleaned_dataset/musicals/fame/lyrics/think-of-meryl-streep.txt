------ Think of Meryl Streep ------
--- Unknown ---
Think of how to use it
Use it on the stage
Think of Katherine Hepburn
Think of Gerry Page
--- Unknown ---
Think of all the feelings
Wasted on this creep
Think of how you could use them
Think of Meryl Streep
--- Unknown ---
Why should I be crazy
Spilling out my guts
Make a big explosion
Go completely nuts
--- Unknown ---
These are my emotions
Mine alone to keep
I know I could use them
Think of Meryl Streep
--- Unknown ---
Inside me there's a world of color and light
Nothing has to be wrong
Nothing has to be right
Inside me are treasures that glow
--- Unknown ---
An actress's job is to know what she's willing to show
And then hide all the rest so no-one's the wiser
Save up all the best, like Midas the miser
Keep every moment under control
Always in charge, playing a role
--- Unknown ---
Smile and shrug your shoulders
Make believe it's fine
Come up with an answer
Or a witty line
--- Unknown ---
Though your heart is breaking
Never start to weep
Someday you can use it
Someday you can use it
Someday you can use it
