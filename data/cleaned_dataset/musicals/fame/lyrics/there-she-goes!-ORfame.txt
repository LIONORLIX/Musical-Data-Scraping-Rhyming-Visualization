------ There She Goes! /Fame ------
--- Unknown ---
There she goes
Ain't she the picture of a real live star?
You want to follow her whoever you are
And there she goes
--- Unknown ---
She's passin' you
You better hurry if you wanna look
Maybe you'll get her in your autograph book
She's passin' you
--- Unknown ---
Reach out to touch, don't be shy
There ain't no reason to be scared
No it's too much I can't look her in the eye
No I'm not prepared
--- Unknown ---
I'm on top of the charts
I'm on top in their hearts
Look at them all
Look at the crowds
Everything is beautiful up here in the clouds
--- Unknown ---
Fame
I'm gonna live forever
I'm gonna learn how to fly
I feel it comin' together
People will see me and cry
--- Unknown ---
Fame
I'm gonna make it to heaven
Light up the sky like a flame
--- Unknown ---
Fame
I'm gonna live forever
Baby remember my name
--- Unknown ---
Remember
Remember
Remember
Remember
Remember
Remember
--- Unknown ---
Voy a vivir pa' siempre
Voy allegar a volar
Fame
estrella en todo'el cielo
que em pe zara a brillar
--- Unknown ---
Voy a vivir pa' siempre
Voy allegar a volar, volar
estrella en todo'el cielo
Mira, Mira
Quiero brillar
--- Unknown ---
I'm on top of the charts
I'm on top in their hearts
Look at the crowds
Look at them all
Ay mamacita mia, I'm havin' a ball
--- Unknown ---
There she goes
There she goes
There she goes
There she goes
Now wouldn't anybody wish they were her
Wish they were her
And there she goes
--- Unknown ---
Remember
Remember
Remember
Remember
