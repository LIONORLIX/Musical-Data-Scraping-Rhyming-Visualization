------ Bring on Tomorrow (Reprise) ------
--- Unknown ---
We Have Arrived, At A Moment In Our Lives
When The Future Passes Into Our Hands
We Can Find Out Are We Really Strong Enough
To Fulfill What The Future Demands
--- Unknown ---
We Can Stand On The Edge And Look Out Into Space
And Be Awed By The Wonders We See
--- Unknown ---
We Can All Make A Pledge That The Whole Human Race
Will Become What We Want It To Be
--- Unknown ---
Bring On Tomorrow, Let It Shine
Like The Sun Coming Up On A Beautiful Day
It's Yours And Mine, We Can Make A Difference
It's Not Too Late
Bring On Tomorrow, We Can't Wait
--- Unknown ---
Long Long Ago, In A World We Never Made
We Were Children Who Were Making Belief
Closing Our Eyes, We Were Travelers In Heir
To A Land We Would Not Want To Leave
--- Unknown ---
But This Fairy Tale Land (Fairy Tale Land)
Fades Away As We Grow (As We Grow)
And We All Have To Say Our Goodbyes (Bye, Bye)
--- Unknown ---
And We Now Understand
That This World That We Know
Can Be Ours, If We Open Our Eyes
--- Unknown ---
Bring On Tomorrow, Let It Shine
Like The Sun Coming Up On A Beautiful Day
It's Yours And Mine, We Can Make A Difference
It's Not Too Late
Bring On Tomorrow, We Can't Wait
--- Unknown ---
Bring On Tomorrow, We Can't Wait
Bring On Tomorrow, It's Not Too Late
Bring On Tomorrow, We Can't Wait
Bring On Tomorrow, We Can't Wait
--- Unknown ---
Bring On Tomorrow, Let It Shine
Like The Sun Coming Up On A Beautiful Day
It's Yours And Mine, We Can Make A Difference
It's Not Too Late
Bring On Tomorrow, We Can't Wait
