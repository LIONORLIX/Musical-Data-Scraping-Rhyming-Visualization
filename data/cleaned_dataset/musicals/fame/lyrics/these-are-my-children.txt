------ These Are My Children ------
--- Unknown ---
In times of trouble
When all the world seems, oh, so dark
And I can't find a way to cope
--- Unknown ---
When deep down inside me
I can no longer feel the spark
When I can see no ray of hope
--- Unknown ---
When I am lost
What makes it all worthwhile
One simple thought to make me smile
--- Unknown ---
These are my children
My saving grace
I see my calling
In every face
--- Unknown ---
These are my children
And I thank God
For choosing me, for choosing me
--- Unknown ---
I wasn't blessed
As other women in this life
To have my own, to be mother and wife
--- Unknown ---
But I was blessed
Beyond where wildest dreams can reach
For I have the privilege
Yes, the privilege to teach
--- Unknown ---
These are my children
My saving grace
I see my calling
In every face
--- Unknown ---
These are my children
My family tree
And I thank God
And I thank God
--- Unknown ---
Yes, I thank God
For choosing me
For choosing me
