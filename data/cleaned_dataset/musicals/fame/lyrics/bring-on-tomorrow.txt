------ Bring on Tomorrow ------
--- Unknown ---
We have arrived at a moment in our lives
When the future passes into out hands
We can find out, are we really strong enough
To fulfill what the future demands
--- Unknown ---
We can stand on the edge
And look out into space
And be awed
By the wonders we see
--- Unknown ---
We can all make a pledge
That the whole human race
Will become what we want it to be
--- Unknown ---
Bring on tomorrow
Let it shine
Like the sun coming up on a beautiful day
It's yours and mine
--- Unknown ---
We can make a difference
It's not too late
Bring on tomorrow
We can't wait
--- Unknown ---
Long, long ago in a world we never made
We were children who were making believe
Closing our eyes
We were travelers in air
To a land we would not want to leave
--- Unknown ---
But the fairy tale land, fades away as we grow
And we all have to say our goodbyes
And we now understand, that this world that we know
Can be ours if we open our eyes
--- Unknown ---
Bring on tomorrow
Let it shine
Like the sun coming up on a beautiful day
It's yours and mine
--- Unknown ---
We can make a difference
It's not too late
Bring on tomorrow
We can't wait
--- Unknown ---
Bring on tomorrow
We can't wait
Bring on tomorrow
It's not too late
--- Unknown ---
Bring on tomorrow
We can't wait
Bring on tomorrow
We can't wait
--- Unknown ---
Bring on tomorrow
Let it shine
Like the sun coming up on a beautiful day
It's yours and mine
--- Unknown ---
We can make a difference
It's not too late
Bring on tomorrow
We can't wait
--- Unknown ---
Bring on tomorrow
