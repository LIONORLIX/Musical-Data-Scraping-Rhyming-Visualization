------ Let's Play a Love Scene ------
--- Unknown ---
We always seem to be
Sister and brotherly
It's such a lovely way to be
--- Unknown ---
And I want to say
What it means to me
How I could never be the same without you
--- Unknown ---
And something more that I know
Though I never could show
How it kept right on growing
--- Unknown ---
The way I know I really feel about you
The way I know I'll always feel about you
Why can't we, why can't we, why can't we try
--- Unknown ---
To play a love scene
We don't need the violins to play a love scene
Where we see how love begins
--- Unknown ---
If we could find a way to start
And learn to play the part
A perfect scene from a play unknown
Let's play a love scene, of our own
--- Unknown ---
And I want to say what it means to me
How I could never be the same without you
And something more that I know
Though I never could show
How it kept right on growing
--- Unknown ---
The way I know I really feel about you
The way I know I'll always feel about you
Why can't we, why can't we, why can't we try
--- Unknown ---
To play a love scene
We don't need the violins to play a love scene
Where we see how love begins
--- Unknown ---
Find a way to start and play it from the heart
A perfect scene from a play unknown
Let's play a love scene
