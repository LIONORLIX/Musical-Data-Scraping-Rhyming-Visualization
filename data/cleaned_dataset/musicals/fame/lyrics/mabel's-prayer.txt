------ Mabel's Prayer ------

Oh Lord give me a sign
Give me a call on your heavenly line
Tell me, oh Lord, what it is that you want of me
Keep me from eatin' whatever's in front of me
--- Unknown ---
Oh Lord give me a sign
Oh Lord give her a sign
Give her a call on your heavenly line
Call me up, call me up on your heavenly line
--- Unknown ---
Tell her oh Lord, what it is that you want of her
Tell me oh save me
Keep her from eatin' whatever's in front of her
Save me from eatin' whatever's in front of me
--- Unknown ---
Oh Lord, give me the answer
Ooh, ah
Save me from being the world's fattest dancer
