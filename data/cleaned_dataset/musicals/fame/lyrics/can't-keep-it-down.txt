------ Can't Keep It Down ------
--- Unknown ---
You know what it's like
When you wake up in the mornin' and it's hard,
Standin' up straight at attention
Like the changin' of the guard?
Or how it is in a porno shop
When you put you quarter in the slot,
And you try to look cool
So nobody knows that you're hot?
You go to a club and you're high
On some fine marijuana
And the singer of the band
Copped all of her moves from Madonna .... and you wanna
Or late at night, you're home in bed alone,
And it's cold out,
And put your hand where it's warm
While you open up Miss January's fold-out
--- Unknown ---
Well, that's how it is, when she's around,
And I can't, no I can't
I can't keep it down!
--- Unknown ---
I can't keep it down when that girl's around
I can't keep it under my control
I can't k-k-keep it down, no, no I can't!
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna rock and roll!
--- Unknown ---
I'm thinkin' 'bout the time in my life
When I first learned what cryin' was,
The first time I ever had to come face to face
With what dyin' was,
The relatives gathered all in black
To mourn for my great aunt Juanita,
When who comes through the door to pay her respects
But our cousin Conchita,
The tears in her eyes only made them look
Even more Spanish,
As I watched her I swear I could feel the floor
Under me vanish,
She goes to them all, then she fin'ly
Comes over to me,
And she kisses my cheek and I lower my eyes,
I can hardly believe what I see!
--- Unknown ---
'Cause I'm lookin' down the front of her gown,
And I can't, no, I can't
I can't keep it down!
--- Unknown ---
I can't keep it down when that girl's around
I can't keep it under my control
I can't k-k-keep it down, no, no I can't!
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna rock and roll!
