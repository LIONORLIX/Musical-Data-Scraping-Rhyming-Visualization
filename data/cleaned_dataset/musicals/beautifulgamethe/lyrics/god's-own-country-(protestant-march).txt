------ God's Own Country (Protestant March) ------
--- Unknown ---
Mob
Stand up lads and fight for god's own country.
We'll take the battle to the enemy.
We are young and we are strong.
And we must right an ancient wrong.
--- Unknown ---
For the land of our fathers we'll make ourselves martyrs
We're happy to die that our people may be free.
It is our generation that must cleanse the nation
For our cause is just and we'll answer to history.
--- Unknown ---
Pack up and get out of god's own country!
Raise your women and your children up and flee.
Or you'll be buried in the dust,
For if you're not you'll bury us.
