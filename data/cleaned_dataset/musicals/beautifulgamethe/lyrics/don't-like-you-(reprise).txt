Ginger
I was wondering if there's
Any chance that you'd be my bird?
Or if you want, i'll bugger off, just give me the word.

Bernadette
Not at all, i'd really like to see you again.
If you think it wouldn't be too much of a pain.

Ginger
Bloody hell, it's taken me a year to ask this.
--- Unknown ---
Bernadette
If that's the case, why don't we
Celebrate with a kiss?
--- Unknown ---
Both
'Cos i'm quite sure that i like you.

Ginger
I like you.

Bernadette
I like you.

Both
Oh dear, i think i love you.
It's strange but things have changed.
'Cos now i've found my boy/girl.
