Christine
Dream about a day when we'll be
Calm, serene, completely carefree.
Just for fun. Think of one. Ordinary day.
--- Unknown ---
Ask yourself what it would feel like.
Dream the dream with all of your might.
Close your eyes. Visualise. Just one normal day.

Time to find out who we are.
Time to find our lucky star.
Time for all our pain to cease.
We'll love in peace.

Just imagine no more violence.
No more bombs. The sound of silence.
Time to be. You and me. Time to love in peace.

Both
Days of hope so calm and tranquil.
Private moments to be thankful.
On our own. Left alone. Free to love in peace.

Then we'll be free
To love in peace.
