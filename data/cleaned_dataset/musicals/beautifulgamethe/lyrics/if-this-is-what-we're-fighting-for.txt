------ If This Is What We're Fighting For ------
--- Unknown ---
Mary
If this is what we are fighting for, if this is the way we begin,
With the innocent dying, the whole nation crying,
If this is how we fight our war, i don't want to win.
--- Unknown ---
We say that justice is our aim, but what does that justice mean?
Condemned without trial, no chance of denial.
To cripple men in freedom's name is utterly obscene.
--- Unknown ---
If men must die, we must ask why
Their murder is not a sin?
Though our cause is just we've betrayed its trust.
If this is what we're fighting for i don't want to win.
--- Unknown ---
If unity's the thing we crave, then who will be unified?
The bitter and grieving, no cause to believe in.
There'll be one nation in the grave, uniting those who've died.
--- Unknown ---
Holy wars. Settling scores.
Ancient debts to call in.
We just loved to kill and we always will.
If hatred's all we're fighting for then i don't want to win.
I don't want to win.
