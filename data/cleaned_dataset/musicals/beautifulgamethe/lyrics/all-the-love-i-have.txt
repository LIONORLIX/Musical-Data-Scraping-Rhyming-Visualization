------ All The Love I Have ------
--- Unknown ---
John
You know that our parting breaks my heart.
I have never felt such sorrow.
All the love i have i leave with you.
--- Unknown ---
I once promised 'til death do us part
And yet i'll be gone tomorrow.
Please believe me what i said was true.
--- Unknown ---
But when i go, i'm on my own. The path i walk, i walk alone.
I face a bitter world with only memories to guide me.
--- Unknown ---
I care more than i have ever cared.
Yet i know that i am leaving.
You'll be in my heart my whole life through.
And all the love i have i leave with you.

Mary
You're a father, you've a family.
Your son needs you, don't ignore him.
Just to fight a war you cannot win.
--- Unknown ---
John
I hope my son will be proud of me.
When i fight i'm fighting for him.
Share the love i leave for you with him.
--- Unknown ---
Mary
And so we all must pay the price, for such a stupid sacrifice.
Don't you understand that this won't end 'til we let it.
--- Unknown ---
John
When i'm gone you know i won't be back.
Mine's a path that has no turning.
Please believe me what i said was true.
That all the love i have i leave with you.
--- Unknown ---
Mary
And all the love i have, you take with you.
