------ The Craic ------
--- Unknown ---
All
Are you
Up for the craic?
Do you know how to party?
--- Unknown ---
Here's the
Plan of attack
Give me a drink and start me.
--- Unknown ---
Are you quite sure that you've got the stomach for it?
Once the craic's started there's no way to ignore it.
Free your wild side then let it all out, don't fear it.
Don't just dance with your feet, dance with your very spirit.
--- Unknown ---
We're all
On for the craic.
Everyone's made their minds up.
There'll be
No looking back.
Nobody shouting time's up.
--- Unknown ---
We're all up for the craic,
Partying's what we're made for
Don't be boring or slack,
Dance 'til it makes your feet sore.
--- Unknown ---
We won't stop now that it's really getting going.
What the night promises there's no way of knowing.
Girl, boy. Boy, girl. We can lose our inhibitions.
Dance close, hold tight, come on really make some friction.
--- Unknown ---
We all live for the craic.
Everyone's on the dance floor
End up, flat on your back.
Good times have to be paid for.
