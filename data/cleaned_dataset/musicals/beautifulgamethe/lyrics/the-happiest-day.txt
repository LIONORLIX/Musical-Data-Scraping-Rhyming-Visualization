------ The Happiest Day ------
--- Unknown ---
Mary
God i hope i've made the right decision.
Do i want to be somebody's wife?
Will this be the day i go to prison?
Or is it the happiest day of my life?

John
I had fifteen pints of guinness last night.
Vindaloo with prawns and pilau rice.
Tell the priest to just perform the last rites.
Is this the happiest day of my life?

Father o'donnell
We're gathered here together,
To join these two for ever,
And put asunder never,
Until death do them part.
Our holy saviour jesus
Is watching now and sees us,
Binding these two as
One single beating heart.
