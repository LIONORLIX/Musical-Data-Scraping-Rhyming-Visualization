------ God's Own Country ------

Mary
Where we live is god's own country,
Though it's dirtier and poorer than he planned.
Broken windows, broken lives.
Jobless husbands, weeping wives.
--- Unknown ---
It may not look like god's own country.
But god is love and i know he loves this land.
Though it's ragged and it's worn
It's the place where i was born.
--- Unknown ---
The beauty lies within in god's own country.
It sleeps beneath the soil and 'neath the sand.
It's our mothers and fathers, our heroes and martyrs,
For god's in the people and people are the land.
Each new generation will rebuild the nation,
That's how it's been since our history began.

Other girl
In the darkness of the night i hear it singing.
The whispering of the wind and rain, it's song.
--- Unknown ---
Both
A sublime eternal tune,
To the rhythms of the moon.
These ancient chords were formed in the beginning,
And they sing to me my country right or wrong.
These are songs we always sang,
No one knows when they began.

Mary
This fair land is god's own country,
And it's catholic and republican and free

Other girl
It's a protestant land made by god's perfect hand,
And a protestant country it will always be.

Both girls
For ireland is mine and is so for all time,
From the atlantic ocean unto the irish sea.
--- Unknown ---
Where i live is god's own country.
I was born here and this land belongs to me.
It's in our blood and in our bones.
It's the place that we call home.
