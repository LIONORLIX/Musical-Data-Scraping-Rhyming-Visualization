Us
This is it, what a blast, in the final at last.
We're a dream of a team, we're just totally excited.
What a thrill, twenty nil, we'll go in for the kill.
On a roll for a goal we could take on man united.
--- Unknown ---
Them
Try a pass, shift your arse, come on show us some class.
Get stuck in, play to win 'til the very final minute.
Knock it back, then attack, come on lads it's a crack.
If in doubt, kick it out 'cos we're really going to win it.

John
Oh what a lovely little move i would say.
This boy has not got a lot to prove on the day,
Must be on some sort of potion.
--- Unknown ---
He doesn't need any other men. What a run.
Let's take a look at that move again. Just for fun.
This time let's watch in slow motion.
--- Unknown ---
All the boys
Oh what a lovely little move i would say.
This boy has not got a lot to prove on the day,
Must be on some sort of potion.

We're the team that rocks
We're the dog's bollocks.

Crowd
You fat bastard, you're rubbish.
You ginger git, look his gut's double size.
What a useless tub, what a lard arse.
Christ now we know who ate all of the pies.
--- Unknown ---
He goes in for the kill and he makes it one nil!
What a fabulous goal, it enraptures the soul.
The boy's magic.

Father o'donnell
My god this looks tense.
They've got past our defence.
Slide in low, on the toe, get stuck in, have a go, risk a booking.
Bring him down to the ground, don't just piddle around
Chance your luck, chop him up, you can see that the ref's
Not looking.

Thomas
I clearly played straight for the ball, did you see?
That dozy prat took a fall right in front of me.
Any sane ref would agree it.
--- Unknown ---
Ref
Out comes the book and a red card. Off you go
You like to think that you're so dead hard, now you know.
They get a direct free kick.

All
Take the hero's role!
Score the winning goal!

Green is the colour
Soccer the game.

A thousand more for

We're bloody magic.
Just fucking magic.
