------ Our Kind Of Love ------

Christine
Our kind of love.
Our kind of passion.
Burns with a heat so
Hard to bear.
--- Unknown ---
It's not a game.
No fad or fashion.
Our kind of love's for
Those who dare.
--- Unknown ---
I must be strong.
I must be bolder.
Cling to my dream and
Never tire.
--- Unknown ---
Each love denied
Leaves people colder.
New love rekindles
Every fire.
I shan't betray my
Heart's desire.
--- Unknown ---
Even though we come from different sides,
We won't hide.
--- Unknown ---
I am in love.
No one can blame me.
Such is my story,
And my fate.
--- Unknown ---
My kind of love
Will never shame me.
My love is stronger
Than their hate.
My love is stronger
Than their hate.
--- Unknown ---
I shall cling to him with all my might,
It's my right.
--- Unknown ---
All kinds of love
Bring us together.
Causes the broken
Hearts to mend.
--- Unknown ---
People must love,
Now and forever.
There's only one love in the end.
There's only one love in the end.
