------ Let Us Love In Peace (Reprise) ------

Bernadette
Just imagine no more violence.
No more bombs. The sound of silence.
Time to be
Young and free.
Time to love in peace.
--- Unknown ---
Days of hope so calm and tranquil.
Private moments to be thankful.
On our own,
Left alone,
Free to love in peace.
--- Unknown ---
All three girls
Time to simply sit and breathe,
Time to learn how to believe,
And give thanks for our release,
To love in peace.
--- Unknown ---
Bernadette
Time to dance and time to grow.
Time to learn and time to know.
Time to prosper and increase.
Make love in peace.

On my knees and pray
For that one
Ordinary day

Bernadette
Then we'll be free
To love in peace.

Thanks for the life of gregory o'shaugnessy.

All
Sometimes i get
On my knees and pray
For that one
Ordinary day
When all the pain will fin'lly cease.
Then we'll be free
To love in peace.
