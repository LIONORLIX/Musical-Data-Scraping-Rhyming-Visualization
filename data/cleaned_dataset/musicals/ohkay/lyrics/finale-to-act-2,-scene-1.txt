------ Finale to Act 2, Scene 1 ------
--- GIRLS ---
On single life today
The curtain's falling:
And oh! We've got to say
It's most enthralling.
They'll honeymoon away -
Niag'ra's calling.
Don't you just adore it!
They've a nice day for it!
Bachelor boy and bachelor girl-goodbye!
--- BRIDESMAIDS ---
It's never too late to Mendelsshon
It doesn't matter how long you have tarried.
Two hearts are at Journey's Endelssohn
And we have all come here to see them married.
--- ENSEMBLE ---
And now
We'll hear them take their vow -
The happy bride and groom.
They're through
When they have said I do! -
The happy bride and groom.
One thing!
Please don't forget the ring -
Oh, happy bride and groom.
Be gay -
This is your wedding day -
Be happy! Happy happy bride and groom!

Though I'm patiently waiting,
He is long overdue.
If he keeps hesitating,
Tell me, what can I do?
Someday he will appear -
Perhaps he's near.
I'm not going to worry
But I do wish he'd hurry.
--- ENSEMBLE ---
Soon or late-maybe -
If you wait-maybe -
Paradise will open its gate
