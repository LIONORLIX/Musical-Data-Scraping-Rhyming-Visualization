1st Verse
--- JIMMY ---
It's good to See familiar faces -
Rosie, Posie, Josie, Polly, Molly, May.
I've thought of you in far-off places -
Hilda, Gilda, Tilda, Billie, Lily, Fay.
Without you, dear old pals, I've known some
Days that were awf'ly lonesome.

Refrain
I hope you've missed me as I missed you,
Dear little girl.
I was lonesome; were you lonesome, too,
Dear little girl?
--- Unknown ---
Now that I am here again,
I could jump for joy;
With such friends it's clear again
I'm a lucky boy.
Make me happy, tell me this is true,
Dear little girl;
Say you missed me much as I missed you,
Dear little girl.

Say you missed me much as I missed you,
