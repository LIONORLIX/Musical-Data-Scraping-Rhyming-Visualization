--- JIMMY ---
I remember the bliss
Of that wonderful kiss.
I knew that a boy
Could never have more joy
From any little miss.
--- KAY ---
I remember it quite;
'Twas a wonderful night.
--- JIMMY ---
Oh, how I'd adore it
If you would encore it.

Do, do, do
What you've done, done, done
Before, Baby.
Do, do, do
What I do, do, do
Adore, Baby.
Let's try again,
Sigh again,
Fly again to heaven.
Baby, see
It's A B C -
I love you and you love me.
I know, know, know
What a beau, beau, beau
Should do, Baby;

So don't, don't, don't
Say it won't, won't, won't

Dum de dum de dum-dum-dum,
So do, do, do
What you've done, done, done
Before.

2nd Verse
--- KAY ---
Sweets we've tasted before
Cannot stand an encore.
You know that a miss
Who always gives a kiss
Would soon become a bore.
--- JIMMY ---
I can't see that at all;
True love never should pall.
--- KAY ---
I was only teasing;
What you did was pleasing.
