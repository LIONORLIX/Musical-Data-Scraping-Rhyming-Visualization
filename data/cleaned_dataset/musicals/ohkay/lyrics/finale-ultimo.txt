------ Finale Ultimo ------
--- KAY ---
I hope you've missed me as I missed you,
Dear little boy.
I was lonesome; were you lonesome, too,
Dear little boy?
Now that you are here again,
My head's in a whirl.
Dear old pal, it's clear again
I'm a lucky girl.
--- JIMMY ---
Oh do, do, do
What you've done, done, done
Before, Baby.
--- KAY ---
Do, do, do
What I do, do, do
Adore, Baby.
--- POTTER ---
Let's try again,
Sigh again,
Fly again to heaven.
--- PHIL ---
Baby, see
It's ABC -
--- POTTER a PHIL ---
I love you and you love me.
--- DUKE ---
I know, know, know
What a beau, beau, beau
Should do, Baby.
--- DOLLY ---
So don't, don't, don't
Say it won't, won't, won't
Come true, Baby.
--- ALL SIX ---
My heart begins to hum -
--- SHORTY ---
Dum de dum de dum-dum-dum.
--- ENTIRE COMPANY ---
So do, do, do
What you've done, done, done
