------ Heaven on Earth ------

Verse
--- JIMMY ---
At a very early age I decided
That worry doesn't get you anywhere;
And it's very lucky for me that I did,
For of trouble I've had much more than my share.
If you give in when breaks are bad, you're gone;
Here's the only way to carry on:

Refrain
--- Unknown ---
Reach up high-pull down the sky -
Make this a heaven on earth.
Can't go wrong singing a song -
Make this a heaven on earth.
This is the advice I'm giving:
Start loving and living
For all that you're worth.
Oh, reach up high-pull down the sky -
