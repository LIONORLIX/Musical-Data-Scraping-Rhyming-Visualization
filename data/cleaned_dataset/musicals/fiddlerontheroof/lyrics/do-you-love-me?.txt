------ Do You Love Me? ------

(Tevye)
Golde, I have decided to give Perchik permission to become engaged to our daughter, Hodel.
--- Unknown ---
(Golde)
What??? He's poor! He has nothing, absolutely nothing!
--- Unknown ---
(Tevye)
He's a good man, Golde.
I like him. And what's more important, Hodel likes him. Hodel loves him.
So what can we do?
It's a new world... A new world. Love. Golde...
--- Unknown ---
Do you love me?
--- Unknown ---
(Golde)
Do I what?
--- Unknown ---
(Tevye)
Do you love me?
--- Unknown ---
(Golde)
Do I love you?
With our daughters getting married
And this trouble in the town
You're upset, you're worn out
Go inside, go lie down!
Maybe it's indigestion
--- Unknown ---
(Tevye)
Golde I'm asking you a question...
--- Unknown ---
Do you love me?
--- Unknown ---
(Golde)
You're a fool
--- Unknown ---
(Tevye)
I know...
--- Unknown ---
But do you love me?
--- Unknown ---
(Golde)
Do I love you?
For twenty-five years I've washed your clothes
Cooked your meals, cleaned your house
Given you children, milked the cow
After twenty-five years, why talk about love right now?
--- Unknown ---
(Tevye)
Golde, The first time I met you
Was on our wedding day
I was scared
--- Unknown ---
(Golde)
I was shy
--- Unknown ---
(Tevye)
I was nervous
--- Unknown ---
(Golde)
So was I
--- Unknown ---
(Tevye)
But my father and my mother
Said we'd learn to love each other
And now I'm asking, Golde
Do you love me?
--- Unknown ---
(Golde)
I'm your wife
--- Unknown ---
(Tevye)
I know...
But do you love me?
--- Unknown ---
(Golde)
Do I love him?
For twenty-five years I've lived with him
Fought him, starved with him
Twenty-five years my bed is his
If that's not love, what is?
--- Unknown ---
(Tevye)
Then you love me?
--- Unknown ---
(Golde)
I suppose I do
--- Unknown ---
(Tevye)
And I suppose I love you too
--- Unknown ---
(Both)
It change a thing
But even so
After twenty-five years
