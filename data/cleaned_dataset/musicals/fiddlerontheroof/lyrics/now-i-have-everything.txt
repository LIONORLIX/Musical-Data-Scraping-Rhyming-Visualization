------ Now I Have Everything ------
--- Unknown ---
(Perchik)
I used to tell myself,
That i had everything,
But that was only half true,
I had an aim in life,
And that was eveyrthing,
But now i even have you.
--- Unknown ---
I have,
Something that i would die for,
Something that i would live for too-
Yes!
--- Unknown ---
Now i have everything,
Not only everything,
I have a little bit more
Besides haviing everything,
I know what everything's for.
--- Unknown ---
I used to wonder "could there be a wife?"
To share such a difficult,
Wand'ring kind of life.
--- Unknown ---
(hodel)
I was only out of sight,
Waiting right here.
--- Unknown ---
(perchik)
Who knows tomorrow where our home will be.
--- Unknown ---
(hodel)
I'll be with you and that's home enough for me.
--- Unknown ---
(perchik)
Everything is right at hand.
--- Unknown ---

Simple and clear.

Someone that i would live for too!

Not only everything,
