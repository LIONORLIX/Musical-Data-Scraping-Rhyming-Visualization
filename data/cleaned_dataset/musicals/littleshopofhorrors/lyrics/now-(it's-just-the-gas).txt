------ Now (It's Just the Gas) ------
--- SEYMOUR ---
Now, do it now
While he's gassing himself to a palpable stupor
The timing's ideal and the moment is super
To ready and fore and blow the sick bastard away
--- Unknown ---
Now, do it now
Just a flicker of pressure right here, right here on the trigger
And Audrey won't have to put up that oig for another day
Now- for the girl, now- for the plant
Now- yes I will... but I can't
--- ORIN ---
Don't be fooled if I should giggle
Like a sappy, happy dope
It's just the gas, it's got me high
But don't let that fact deceive you
Any moment I could die
Though I giggle and I chortle,
Bear in mind I'm not immortal
Why this whole thing strikes me funny
I don't know- 'cause it really is a rotten way to go
--- SEYMOUR ---
What we have here is an ethical dilemma
'Less I help him get the mask removed,
He doesn't have a prayer
True the gun as never fired,
But the way events transpired,
I could finish him with simple laisssez faire
--- ORIN ---
Don't be fooled if I should chuckle
Like hyenas in a zoo
It's just the gas, it turns me on
But don't let my mirth deceive you
Any moment I'll be gone
All my vital signs are failing
'Cause the oxide I'm inhaling
Makes it difficult as hell to catch my breath
Are you dumb or hard of hearing?
Or relieved my end is nearing?
Are you satisfied? I laughed myself to...
