We're closed for renovation
For spiffing-up and grooming
'Cause customers are flocking
And business has been booming
We need refrigeration
In our new, improved display
So we're closed for removation
Today

We're closed for decoration
'Cause fortune has been smiling
So now we're due for painting
New plumbing and re-tiling
We'll make a ship-shape showplace
Of a little shop and then
Tomorrow we'll be open
Again
--- Unknown ---
We're closed for renovation
For swabbing-down and brooming
'Cause business has been thriving
Since Audrey Two's been blooming
The phones have not stopped ringing
With the customers who say
--- SEYMOUR ---
Another bunch of peonies
--- AUDREY ---
Another dozen daisies please

Geraniums, anemones

Forget-me-nots and fleur-de-lis

With gratis home deliveries
