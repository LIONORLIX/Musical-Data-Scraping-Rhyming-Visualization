------ Finale (Don't Feed the Plants) ------
--- CRYSTAL, RONETTE, CHIFFON ---
Subsequent to the events you have just witnessed
Similar events in cities across America
Events which bore a striking resemblance
To the ones you have just seen- began occurring
Subsequent to the events you have just witnessed,
Unsuspecting jerks from Maine to California
Made the acquaintance of a new breed of flytrap
And got sweet-talked into feeding it blood.
--- Unknown ---
Thus the plants worked their terrible will
Finding jerks who would feed them their fill
And the plants proceeded to grow and grow- and grow
And begin what they came here to do
Which was essentially to
Eat Cleveland and Des Moines
And Peoria and New York
and where you live!
--- COMPANY ---
They may offer you fortune and fame
Love and money and instant acclaim
But whatever they offer you
Don't feed the plants
--- Unknown ---
They may offer you lots of cheap thrills
Fancy condos in Beverly Hills
But whatever they offer you
Don't feed the plants
--- Unknown ---
Look out!  Here comes Audrey Two!
Look out!
--- AUDREY II ---
Here I come for you!
--- COMPANY ---
Hold your hat and hang on to your soul
Something's coming to eat the world whole
If we fight it we've still got a chance
But whatever they offer you
Though they're slopping the trough for you
Please, whatever they offer you
Don't feed the plants
--- AUDREY II ---
We'll have tomorrow
--- COMPANY ---
Don't feed the plants!
