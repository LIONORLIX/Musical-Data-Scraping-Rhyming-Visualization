When I was younger, just a bad little kid
My mama noticed funny things I did
Like shooting puppies with a B.B. gun
I'd poison guppies and when I was done
I'd find a pussycat and bash in its head
That's when my mama said
--- CRYSTAL, RONETTE, CHIFFON ---
What did she say?
--- ORIN ---
She said, My boy, I think someday
You'll find a way to make your natural tendencies pay
--- Unknown ---
You'll be a dentist
You have a talent for causing things pain
Son, be a dentist
People will pay you to be inhumane
Your temperament's wrong for the priesthood
And teaching would suit you still less
Son, be a dentist
You'll be a success
--- CRYSTAL, RONETTE, CHIFFON ---
Here he is, folks the leader of the plaque!
Watch him suck up that gas!
Oh, my god!
He's a dentist and he'll never ever be any good
Who wants their teeth done by the Marquis de Sade?
Oh that hurts!
I'm not numb!
--- ORIN ---
Oh, shut up.  Open wide.  here I come!
I am your dentist
--- CRYSTAL, RONETTE, CHIFFON ---
Goodness gracious!
--- ORIN ---
And I enjoy the career that I picked
I am your dentist
--- CRYSTAL, RONETTE, CHIFFON ---
Fitting braces
--- ORIN ---
And I get off on the pain I inflict
When I start extracting those molars
You girls will be screaming like holy rollers
--- CRYSTAL, RONETTE, CHIFFON ---
Dentist!
--- ORIN ---
And though it may cause my patients distress
Somewhere in heaven above me, I know that my mama's proud of me
'Cause I'm a dentist- and a success
