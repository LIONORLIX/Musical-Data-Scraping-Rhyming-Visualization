------ Feed Me (Git It) ------
--- AUDREY II ---
Feed me!  Feed me! Feed me!
Feed me, Seymour
Feed me all night long
That's right, boy
You can do it
Feed me, Seymour
Feed me all night long
'Cause if you feed me, Seymour
I can grow up big and strong
--- Unknown ---
Would you like a Cadillac car?
Or a guest shot on Jack Paar?
How about a date with Hedy Lamarr?
You gonna git it.
--- Unknown ---
Would you like to be a big wheel,
Dinin' out for every meal?
I'm the plant that can make it all real
You gonna git it
--- Unknown ---
I'm your genie, I'm your friend
I'm your willing slave
Take a chance, just feed me and
You know the kinda eats,
The kinda red hot treats
The kinda sticky licky sweets
I crave
--- Unknown ---
Come on, Seymour, don't be a putz
Trust me and your life will surely rival King Tut's
Show a little 'nitiative, work up the guts
And you'll git it
--- SEYMOUR ---
I don't know.  I don't know
I have so, so many strong reservations
Should I go and perform mutilations?
--- AUDREY II ---
Think about a room at the Ritz
Wrapped in velvet, covered in glitz
A little nookie gonna clean up your zits
And you'll git it
--- SEYMOUR ---
Gee I'd like a Harley machine,
Toolin' around like I was James Dean,
Makin' all the guys on the corner turn green
--- AUDREY II ---
So go git it
If you wanna be profound
And you really gotta justify
Take a breath and look around
A lot of folks deserve to die
--- SEYMOUR, AUDREY II ---
If you want a rationale
It isn't very hard to see
Stop and think it over, pal
The guy sure looks like plant food to me.
--- SEYMOUR ---
He's so nasty, treatin' her rough,
--- AUDREY II ---
Smackin' her around and always talkin' so tough.
--- SEYMOUR, AUDREY II ---
You (I) need blood and he's got more than enough
