------ Everybody Fits ------
--- Abe ---
Somedays, you just can't begin
You feel, outside looking in
It's like, you're the odd man out
--- Mark, Matthew, Luke, Juan ---
Let me, help you
End your doubt
--- All ---
It doesn't matter
If you're different and out of place
It doesn't matter
If there's acne upon your face
It doesn't matter
Take my hand and then
You will see
Everybody fits in God's great
--- Abe ---
Fam-a-laay
--- Mark, Mattew, Luke, Juan ---
Strangers
--- Abe ---
Seem to, stop and stare
--- Mark, Matthew, Luke, Juan ---
Wonderin'
--- Abe ---
Why you're, even there
--- Mark, Matthew, Luke, Juan ---
Feeling
--- Abe ---
So left out and wrong
--- Mark, Matthew, Luke, Juan ---
I'll show
--- Abe ---
You that
--- All ---
You belong
--- All ---
It doesn't matter
If you have a gigantic nose
It doesn't matter
If you're born with eleven toes
It doesn't matter
You can trust and
Believe in me
Everybody fits in God's great
--- Abe ---
Fam-a-laay
--- Mark ---
In the family of God you'll learn
That there is no such thing as others
All the woman and men on Earth
Can be your
--- Mark, Matthew, Luke, Juan ---
Sisters and your brothers
--- Abe ---
Sisters and your brothers!
--- All ---
It doesn't matter
If you're wrinkled and old and grey
It doesn't matter
If you face Mecca when you pray
It doesn't matter
Won't you listen and
Here my plea, everbody fits
It doesn't matter
If you're yellow or white or red
It doesn't matter
If you're pregnant and you're unwed
It doesn't matter
'Cause the truth it can
Set you free, everbody fits
--- Abe ---
Everybody fits!
--- Mark, Matthew, Luke, Juan ---
It doesn't matter
--- All ---
Every murderer on death row
It doesn't matter
Every prostitute that you know
It doesn't matter
Welcome to the
Fraternity, everybody fits in God's great
--- Abe ---
Fam-a-laay, you and maay
