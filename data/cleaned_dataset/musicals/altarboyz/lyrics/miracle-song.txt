John: 2
Mother Mary got invited to a wedding
Everybody's drinking, excited
When all of a sudden
The wine gave out
Mary on the QT gave JC a shout (Hey!)
Jesus said
Woman what do I have to do with you?
He was only there to party with his twelve member crew
But Mary was his mama so He said
Fill up those cups with water.
And they did thinkin' it was worth a shot
Jesus said
Take some out and give it to the waitah
He drank it said,
Why'd you save the good stuff for latah?
The weddin' was a hit
and everything turned out fine
But how'd he make the water turn into wine?
--- Unknown ---
Christ how'd you do that?
How'd ya make it happen?
Christ how'd you do that?
How'd you make it go down?

Mark: 1
Galilee was where he was
Castin' out demons and preachin' like he does
When a leper showed up
And begged the Big Man
Make me clean! If you're willing you can!
JC feeling sorry 'cause he knew that leprosy is
A whack disease that makes a homie go to pieces
Reached out his hand and touched him (eww)
And I will him be cleansed
He said
And it worked too!
--- Unknown ---
The man was aiight 'cause he came to my boy
Not since Second Kings had anybody heard this noise
And all He had to do was give that guy one little touch
So amazin' I wanna know so much!
--- Unknown ---
Christ how'd you do that?
How'd ya make it happen?
I just gotta ask Jesus Christ
How'd you do that?

Matt:14
His posse's in the water
Rowin' all night
While Jesus prayed to his father
They were hellah far from shore
And the sea was wicked rough
When they saw a ghost just walkin' on the water (scary stuff!)
--- Unknown ---
They all cried out in fear
Thinkin' things were pretty bleak
Floating on the ocean but up a creek
It was I
Jesus said
Don't be afraid
But they had doubt
So Jesus said to Peter
Stand up and get out o' the boat and come to me
And Pete was walkin' like a pro
But the wind kicked up
And he was sinkin' like a stone
So back into the boat Pete n' Jesus hopped
But when they sat down
The wind just... stopped

Seein' is believin' (ooh)
Seein' is believin' (ohoooh)
Seein' is believin' (whoooa)
Seein' is believing (ooh)

He coulda laid low (Seein' is believin')
In a carpenter shop
Just hammerin' away (Seein' is believin')
With the surrogate pop
But He took it to the streets
And kept it real
A lotta folk's sayin'
This guy's the real deal!
--- Unknown ---
They aksed for His help (Seein' is believin')
And He did-n't avoid 'em
Rolled up His sleeves (Seein' is believin')
And Siegfried and Roy'd 'em
no hat, no wand, no abra cadabra (Seein' is believin')
Pretty fly stuff to this
Lowly rapper
--- Unknown ---
But some dude said (Seein' is believin')
That was a long time ago
When's the last time He did a magic show? (Seein' is believin')
Well if your eyes ain't shut (Seein' is believin')
And your heart ain't (iced?)
You might find yourself sayin'
Jesus...
--- Unknown ---
Christ how'd you do that? (nah nah nah nah nah naaah)
How'd ya make it happen?
Christ how'd you do that?
How'd you make it go down?
--- Unknown ---
Christ how'd you do that? (nah nah nah nah nah naaah)
How'd ya make it happen?
Christ how'd you do that?
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus! Christ!
--- Unknown ---
Jesus Christ!
