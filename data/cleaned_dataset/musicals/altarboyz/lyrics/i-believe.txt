------ I Believe ------
--- Abe ---
One beam of light, is enough to see where you're going
One wrong turn, is enough to loose your way
One choice, is all you have to make
One ounce of faith could save the day
I believe, that I came to know you for a reason
I believe, that the things that you say will come true
I believe that with you in my life I'll make it
I believe in you .stlyrics

One Mistake, doesn't have to mean that it's over
--- Luke ---
One bad day, only means there's work to do
--- Mark ---
One night, is sometimes all it takes
--- All ---
To realize one thing is true
I believe, that I came to know you for a reason
I believe, that the things that you say will come true
I believe that with you in my life I'll make it
I believe in you
--- Matthew ---
Take a picture of me now, take a look at who I am
Yesterday I wasn't half as strong
--- Abe, Juan, Luke, and Mark ---
Take a picture of us all, what we've been and what we are
Look at that, and tell me I'm wrong
--- Matthew ---
I BELIEVE!
--- Abe, Juan, Luke, Mark ---
That I came to know you for a reason
--- All ---
I believe, that the things that you say will come true

[Matthew}
Oooohhh

I believe in you
I believe in
