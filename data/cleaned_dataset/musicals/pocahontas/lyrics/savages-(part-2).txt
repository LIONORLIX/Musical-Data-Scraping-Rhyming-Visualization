------ Savages (Part 2) ------
--- Pocahontas ---
Is there nothing I can do?
Will this really be the end?
Is it only death that waits
Just around the riverbend?
[Ratcliffe]
This will be the day ...
[Powhatan]
This will be the morning ...
[English Settlers and Native Americans]
We will see them dying in the dust
[Pocahontas]
I don't know what I can do
Still, I know I've got to try
[English Settlers]
Now we make 'em pay
[Pocahontas]
Eagle, help my feet to fly
[Native Americans]
Now without a warning ...
[Pocahontas]
Mountain, help my heart be great
[English Settlers and Native Americans]
Now we leave 'em blood and bone and rust
[Pocahontas]
Spirits of the earth and sky ...
[English Settlers and Native Americans]
It's them or us
[Pocahontas]
Please don't let it be to late ...
[English Settlers and Native Americans]
They're just a bunch of
Filthy, stinking
[English Settlers]
Savages!
[Native Americans]
Savages!
[English Settlers]
Demons!
[Native Americans]
Devils!
[Ratcliffe]
Kill them!
[Native Americans]
Savages!
[English Settlers]
Savages!
[Ratcliffe]
What are we waiting for?
[All]
Destroy their evil race
Until there's not a trace left
[Pocahontas]
How loud are the drums of war
[English Settlers and Native Americans]
We will sound the drums of war
Now, we sound the drums of war
[Ratcliffe]
Now we see what comes
Of trying to be chums
[Native Americans]
Now we sound the drums ... of ... war!
[English Settlers]
Of course it means the drums ... of ... war!
[Pocahontas]
Is the death of all I love
