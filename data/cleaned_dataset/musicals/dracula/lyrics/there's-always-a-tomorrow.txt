------ There's Always a Tomorrow ------

Mina
I step across the line for you
I plunge myself in mortal sin
I sacrifice my soul to be your bride
I?ve give in to the feelings I can?t hide
I leap with you  behind
Who cares if love is blind?
The certainty is bliss
At last I know my mind
--- Unknown ---
Mina & Dracula
We?ll live our lives and then
We?ll live them once again
There?s always a tomorrow
There?s always a tomorrow
There?s always one more night
--- Unknown ---
Mina
I hear you befor you speak
I?m with you wherever you are
--- Unknown ---
Dracula
When you sleep I?m in your dreams
I can read your thoughts from afar
--- Unknown ---
The first time I saw your face
I knew I would make you mine
I felt a quickening of the pulse
I felt a shiver down my spine Mina,
you?re the chosen one out of all the loves I?ve known
And all my centuries alone
--- Unknown ---
Mina (overlapping)
--- Unknown ---
Mina
Ever since I saw your face
I?ve been trying to deny that I was hopelessly in love
That I could ever say good-bye
Now I know this can?t be done
No I?ll turn away from light
And embrace your endless night
--- Unknown ---
Dracula (Overlapping)
--- Unknown ---
Dracula
But every time I see your face
I?m tormented by this doubt
Can I deprive you of your death?
Can I condemn you to live without this circle of despair?
Or should I not set you free and let you do the same for me?
--- Unknown ---
Mina
I was born to love you
I was born to need you
These are simple truths that I try to betray
--- Unknown ---
Dracula
If you truly love me
Prove to me you love me
Free me and go back to the beauties of day
--- Unknown ---
I can?t poison your life
I can?t drive you insane
I can?t drag you into my world of bloodlust and pain
--- Unknown ---
My life is no life at all, it is bleak and unforgiving
Feeding on a stranger?s blood
Imprisoned by the night
What?s the use for longing life
When life is not worth living?
If you love me set me free and let me touch the light
--- Unknown ---
Mina
Please don?t make me end this before it?s begun
--- Unknown ---
Dracula
Give me the true nightfall
Give me back to darkness
Give me back my soul
And step into the sun
--- Unknown ---
Both
I was born to love you
--- Unknown ---
Dracula
Lived and died to love you
--- Unknown ---
Both
