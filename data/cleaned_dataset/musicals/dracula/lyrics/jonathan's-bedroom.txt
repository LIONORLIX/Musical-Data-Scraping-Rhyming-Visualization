------ Jonathan's Bedroom ------
--- Harker ---
I start to feel that I'm a prisoner here!
Mina, God knows I have just cause for fear
In this curs'ed place!
--- Unknown ---
Will this strange being who exists by night
Let me go free,
Or must I stand and fight?
Will I ever see your face?
--- Unknown ---
No where to hide
No friendly hand
I'm in a spider's web
I twist in vain,
As hope begins to end!
--- Unknown ---
I hear strange voices drifting through the air!
I hear wild laughter, but there's no one there!
I'm under some evil spell!
--- Unknown ---
I'm writing letters to you ev'ry day
But, I have a feeling they're just thrown away!
