------ Modern World / A Perfect Life ------
--- MODERN WORLD ---
--- Seward ---
Taxis to Houston and steamships to Rio
--- Arthur ---
Biograph pictures in Wiltons all day
--- Quincey ---
Specials to Paris and hot air ballooning
--- Mina and Lucy ---
Phonograph Cylinders ready to play
--- Unknown ---
(Sing the next in rounds)
Camera's with shutters, internal combustion.
Phone up your uncle in Shorham-by-Sea.
Cross the Atlantic and be there by Thursday
Jump on a trolley and be home by three.
--- Seward ---
Somewhere in Vienna, there's a chap called Freud who's sure
That it's useless to chain up madmen
He gets better results with his talking cure
--- Quincey ---
Winchester repeaters gonna have to watch their backs
They've got the bolt action Hotchkiss
But the Hun's got a gun gives ya three more cracks
--- All ---
Here comes the modern world
The wonderful modern world
Off to old fashioned thinking
On with the new
Hello to the modern world
The breathtaking modern world
There's nothing today that you can't do
--- Arthur ---
My old four speed Daimler
I'm afraid will have to go
And it's time to replace my steam yacht
There's no earthly excuse for going slow
--- Lucy ---
We're delighted to hear this progressive note
--- Mina ---
And we might feel the same way when we get the vote
--- All ---
Here comes the modern world
The wonderful modern world
Off to old fashioned thinking
On with the new
Hello to the modern world
The breathtaking modern world
There's nothing today that you can't do
--- A PERFECT LIFE ---
--- Unknown ---
A perfect life,
The kind you dream of,
Waits for me,
And yet, and yet?
I can?t shut out
The sense of dread,
This haunting doubt.
--- Unknown ---
I found a man who truly loves me,
I love him,
And yet, and yet?
On this bright day,
A shadow falls
Across my way.
--- Unknown ---
I should hate myself for these irrational ideas,
I should pull myself together,
Cast away my fears.
Part of me is saying,
I?ll soon be where I belong.
Part of me is saying,
Something?s wrong.
--- Unknown ---
A perfect life,
The kind you dream of,
Waits for me,
And yet, and yet?
I fear I might
Be sailing into
Endless night.
--- Unknown ---
Part of me is saying I?ll soon be where I belong.
Part of me is saying, something?s wrong.
--- Unknown ---
A perfect life,
The kind you dream of,,
Waits for me,
And yet, and yet?
I fear I might
Be sailing into
Endless night.
--- Unknown ---
We?ll soon have a perfect life.
