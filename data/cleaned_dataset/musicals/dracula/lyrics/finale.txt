------ Finale ------
--- Mina ---
I step across the line for you,
I plunge myself in mortal sin.
I sacrifice my soul to be your bride
I give into the feelings I can't hide.
I leave my guilt behind;
Who cares if love is blind?
This certainty is bliss,
At last I know my mind.
--- Unknown ---
Both: (Dracula & Mina)
We'll live our lives, and then,
We'll live them once again.
There's always a tomorrow...
There's always a tomorrow,
There's always one more night.
--- Mina ---
I hear you before you speak;
I'm with you wherever you are.
--- Dracula ---
When you sleep I'm in your dreams,
I can read your thoughts from afar.
--- Mina ---
I hear you before you speak;
I'm with you wherever you are.
--- Dracula (overlapping with above) ---
The first time I saw your face
I knew I would make you mine. I felt a quickening of the pulse;
I felt a shiver down my spine.
Mina you're the chosen one,
out of all the loves I've known
in all my centuries alone.
--- Mina ---
Ever since I saw your face,
I've been trying to deny
that I was hopelessly in love,
that I could ever say goodbye.
Now I know that can't be done,
now I'll turn away from light
and embrace your endless night.
--- Dracula (overlapping with above) ---
When you sleep I'm in your dreams,
I can read your thoughts from afar.
--- Dracula ---
But every time I see your face,
I'm tormented by this doubt;
can I deprive you of your death,
can I condemn you to live out this dark circle of despair?
Or should I not set you free
and let you do the same for me?
--- Mina ---
I was born to love you,
I was born to need you,
these are simple truths
that I tried to betray.
--- Dracula ---
If you truly love me,
prove to me you love me,
free me and go back to the beauties of day.
--- Unknown ---
(We hear Vampire Brides screaming off-stage).
--- Unknown ---
Dracula: You want me to risk that happening to you?
--- Unknown ---
Mina: I am prepared to take my chances.
--- Unknown ---
Dracula: The hunted animal's only luxury is to choose the hour of his death.
--- Unknown ---
(We hear a second off-stage scream.)
--- Unknown ---
Mina: Let's escape together.
--- Unknown ---
Dracula: Dawn is breaking.
I can't poison your life,
I can't drive you insane,
I can't drag you into my world of bloodlust and pain!
--- Unknown ---
(We hear third off-stage scream).
--- Dracula (singing) ---
My life is no life at all,
it's bleak and unforgiving.
Feeding on a stranger's blood, imprisoned by the night.
What's the use prolonging life
if life is not worth living?
If you love me, set me free,
and let me touch the light!
--- Mina ---
Please don't make me end this before it's begun...
--- Dracula ---
Give me a true nightfall.
Give me back to darkness.
Give me back my soul and step into the sun.
--- Both ---
I was born to love you.
--- Dracula ---
Lived and died to love you.
--- Both ---
I was born to love you and
