------ The Longer I Live ------
--- Dracula ---
I`ve seen so many sunsets in my life;
I should know everything there is worth knowing.
But since I saw her face
I don`t know where I am,
there`s no map that can show me where I`m going.
The longer I live the more I wonder
if I know anything at all.
If I`ve ever been in love, I can`t recall.
--- Unknown ---
The longer I live the less I`m certain,
that I have all the answers right.
I`d give all my yesterdays to touch the light.
--- Unknown ---
It`s hard to make each moment count when you`re alone,
maybe that`s all I need to know.
--- Unknown ---
The longer I live without her near me,
the longer my empty years will be.
The world will not turn until she turns to me.
--- Unknown ---
The world will not turn until she turns to me!!
