------ Prelude ------
--- Harker ---
To think its taken me a mere two weeks
From London`s smoke to these Carpathian peaks
Where night seems so much more dark
What grim adventures lie in wait for me`
It`s far from what one might expect to be
The life of a lawyers Clerk.
I hear the wolves, I see the mist
Cut through the jagged hills
I feel so cold; it`s not the wind that chills...
--- Unknown ---
Have we arrived` Is this...`
