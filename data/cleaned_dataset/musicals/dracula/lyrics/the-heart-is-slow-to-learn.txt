------ The Heart Is Slow to Learn ------
--- Mina ---
Why do we risk all we have, w
hy give into the lure that calls
from everything forbidden.
What attracts us to the night,
and captures us however hard we fight.
--- Unknown ---
It seems the heart is slow to learn, no one can tell it what to do,
it never learns from its mistakes, what twists and turns it puts us through.
--- Unknown ---
Oh yes the heart is slow to learn,
so every lesson is in vain,
it goes the way it wants to go, regardless of the pain.
--- Unknown ---
And so, I foolishly go on,
ignoring all the signs,
dismissing all the doubt inside me.
--- Unknown ---
For the heart is slow to learn,
no one can tell it what to do,
it never learns from its mistakes, that's why it finally breaks
and overpowers you.
--- Unknown ---
Some passions never let you go,
some fires never cease to burn,
it shouldn't come as a surprise
that the heart is slow to learn.
--- Unknown ---
The heart is slow to learn.
The heart is slow to learn.
