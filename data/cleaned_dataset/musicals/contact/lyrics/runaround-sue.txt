------ Runaround Sue ------
--- Unknown ---
Here’s my story it’s sad but true
It’s about a girl that I once knew
She took my love then ran around
With every single guy in town.
--- Chorus ---
Hayp hayp
Bumda hady hady, hayp hayp
Bumda hady hady, hayp hayp
Bumda hady hady hayp.

Chorus
--- Unknown ---
Ah, I should have known it from the very start,
This girl will leave me with a broken heart.
Now listen people what I'm telling you
A-keep away from-a Runaround Sue.
--- Unknown ---
I miss her lips and the smile on her face,
The touch of her hair and this girl's warm embrace.
So if you don't wanna cry like I do
A-keep away from-a Runaround Sue.

Chorus
--- Unknown ---
Ah, she likes to travel around,
She'll love you but she'll put you down.
Now people let me put you wise,
Sue goes out with other guys.
--- Unknown ---
Here's the moral and the story from the guy who knows,
I fell in love and my love still grows.
Ask any fool that she ever knew, they'll say
------ fin ------
