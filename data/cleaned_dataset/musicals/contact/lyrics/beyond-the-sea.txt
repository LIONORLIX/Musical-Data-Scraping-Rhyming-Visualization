------ Beyond the Sea ------
--- Unknown ---
Somewhere beyond the sea
somewhere waiting for me
my lover stands on golden sands
and watches the ships
that go sailing in.
--- Unknown ---
Somewhere beyond the sea
she's there watching for me
if I could fly like birds on high
then straight to her arms i'd go sailing in.
--- Unknown ---
It's far beyond the stars
It's near beyond the moon
--- Unknown ---
I know beyond the doubt
my heart will take me there
soon, we'll meet beyond the shore
we'll kiss just as before
--- Unknown ---
Happy we'll be beyond the sea
oh and never again
i'll go sailing in.

--- Unknown ---
I know, beyond the doubt
my heart will take me there soon
we'll meet just beyond the shore
we'll kiss just as before.
--- Unknown ---
Oh! Happy we'll be beyond the sea
and never again
I'll go sailing in!
--- Unknown ---
Together we'll be
Just you and me
