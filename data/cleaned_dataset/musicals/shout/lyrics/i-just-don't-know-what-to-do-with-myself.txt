------ I Just Don't Know What To Do With Myself ------
--- Unknown ---
I just don't know what to do with myself
I don't know what to do with myself
planning everything for two
doing everything with you
and now that we're through
I just don't know what to do
--- Unknown ---
I just don't know what to do with myself
I don't know what to do with myself
movies only make me sad
parties make me feel as bad
cause I'm not with you
I just don't know what to do
--- Unknown ---
like a summer rose
needs the sun and rain
I need your sweet love
to beat love away
--- Unknown ---
well I don't know what to do with myself
just don't know what to do with myself
planning everything for two
doing everything with you
and now that we're through
I just don't know what to do
--- Unknown ---
like a summer rose
needs the sun and rain
I need your sweet love
to beat love away
--- Unknown ---
I just don't know what to do with myself
just don't know what to do with myself
just don't know what to do with myself
I don't know what to do with myself
