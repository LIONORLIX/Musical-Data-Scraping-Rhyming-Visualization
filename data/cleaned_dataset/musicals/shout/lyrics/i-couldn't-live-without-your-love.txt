------ I Couldn't Live Without Your Love ------
--- Unknown ---
You're the only one that I rely on
A shoulder there for me to cry on
And the hours alone that I'm without you
All I ever do is think about you
--- Unknown ---
No one knows that you're so understanding
Even though my love is so demanding
Every time you look at me
Then you'll know we'll both agree
That no other love for me
--- Unknown ---
I couldn't live without your love
Now I know you're really mine
Gotta have you all the time
--- Unknown ---
Didn't like you much when I first met you
But somehow I couldn't quite forget you
Said you didn't want a friend or lover
That your life was happy with another
--- Unknown ---
But as time went by my love grew stronger
Knew that I just couldn't wait any longer
For I couldn't let you go and I had to tell you so
That I love you, then you know
--- Unknown ---
I couldn't live without your love
Now I know you really mine
Gotta have you all the time
--- Unknown ---
Now the tears are gone and I'm not crying
When you say you love me you're not lying
So when people want to stare
I know I don't really care
Just as long as you are there
--- Unknown ---
I couldn't live without your love
Now I know you really mine
I gotta have you all the time
--- Unknown ---
Now I couldn't live without your love
Now I know you really mine
