Downtown!
Where all the lights are bright
Downtown!
Waiting for you tonight
Downtown
You?re gonna be alright now

England swings like a pendulum do,
Bobbies on bicycles, two by two,
Westminster Abbey the tower of Big Ben,
The rosy red cheeks of the little children
--- Unknown ---
England swings like a pendulum do?
--- Unknown ---
Round every corner, round every corner
Round every corner, round every corner
Round every corner, round every corner
--- Unknown ---
Stop feeling sad now
Life ain't so bad now
Round every corner (round every corner)
While you're debating,
Something's a-waiting
Round every corner (round every corner)
When Columbus sailed away to other shores,
How could he imagine all that waited for him?
Round every corner (round every corner)
Round every corner (round every corner)
--- Unknown ---
You've gotta stop a-sittin' there on the shelf
You've gotta start lookin' out for yourself
--- Unknown ---
Every day when the work is behind you
And the shop and the store put the lock on the door
Just get away where your worries won't find you
If you like, well I'll tell you more
--- Unknown ---
Don't let the day get the better of you
When the evening comes there's so much to do
You better put on your best and wear a smile
Just come along with me awhile
--- Unknown ---
I know a place where the music is fine
And the lights are always low
I know a place where we can go
--- Unknown ---
Ba ba ba ba da ba, smashing
Ba ba ba da ba ba, hip
Ba ba ba bad a ba?
Groovy, fab, cosmic, swingin?!
--- Unknown ---
At the door there's a man who will greet you
Then you go downstairs to some tables and chairs
Soon I'm sure you'll be tappin' your feet
Because the beat is the greatest there
--- Unknown ---
All around there are girls and boys
It's a swingin' place, a cellar full of noise
It's got an atmosphere of its own somehow
You gotta come along right now cuz I tell you
--- Unknown ---
I know a place where the music is fine
And the lights are always low
I know a place where we can go
--- Unknown ---
Oh? I know a place where the music is fine (I know a place)
And the lights are always low (I know a place)
I know a place where (I know a place)
England swings (yea, yea)
England swings (yea, yea)
England swings (yea, yea)
England swings (yea, yea, yea, yea!)
England swings!
