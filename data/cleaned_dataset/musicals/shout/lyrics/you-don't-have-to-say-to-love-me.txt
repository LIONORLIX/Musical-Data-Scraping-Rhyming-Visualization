------ You Don't Have To Say To Love Me ------
--- Unknown ---
When I said I needed you
You said you would always stay
It wasn't me who changed but you
And now you've gone away
--- Unknown ---
Don't you see
That now you've gone
And I'm left here on my own
That I have to follow you
And beg you to come home?
--- Unknown ---
You don't have to say you love me
Just be close at hand
You don't have to stay forever
I will understand
Believe me, believe me
I can't help but love you
But believe me
I'll never tie you down
--- Unknown ---
Left alone with just a memory
Life seems dead and so unreal
All that's left is loneliness
There's nothing left to feel
--- Unknown ---
You don't have to say you love me
Just be close at hand
You don't have to stay forever
I will understand
Believe me, believe me
--- Unknown ---
You don't have to say you love me
Just be close at hand
You don't have to stay forever
I will understand
