------ To Sir With Love ------
--- Unknown ---
Those school girl days of telling tales
And biting nails are gone
But in my mind I know
They will still live on and on
--- Unknown ---
But how do you thank someone
Who has taken you from crayons to perfume?
It isn't easy, but I'll try
--- Unknown ---
If you wanted the sky
I would write across the sky in letters
That would soar a thousand feet high
To Sir, with love
--- Unknown ---
The time has come for closing books
And long last looks must end
And as I leave I know
That I am leaving my best friend
--- Unknown ---
A friend who taught me right from wrong
And weak from strong
That's a lot to learn, what
can I give you in return?
--- Unknown ---
If you wanted the moon
I would try to make a star
But I, would rather you let me give my heart
