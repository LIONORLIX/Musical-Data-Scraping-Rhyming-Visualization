------ How Can You Tell ------
--- Unknown ---
My love says the sweetest things
Everyone who knows him tells me
That he brings me true loving
But I don't really know 'cause
--- Unknown ---
How can you tell if somebody loves you
How d'you know they mean it
How can you tell if somebody loves you
Maybe he's just playing games with me
O woah woah woah
--- Unknown ---
He smiles when I take his hand
Then he'll kiss me and I just don't understand
Why I doubt it
When he tells me he loves me
How can you tell if somebody loves you
How d'you know they mean it
How can you tell if somebody loves you

Maybe he's just playing games with me
O woah woah woah
--- Unknown ---
I treasure every moment
He and I spent together
Sharing kisses
I wish it would last for ever and ever
--- Unknown ---
Maybe I shouldn't speak of love
But since I met him it's the one thing I think of
And he tells me he feels the same way
--- Unknown ---
And yet how can you tell if somebody loves you
How d'you know they mean it
How can you tell if somebody loves you
Maybe he's just playing games with me
