------ Son Of A Preacher Man ------
--- Unknown ---
Billy-Ray was a preacher's son
And when his daddy would visit he'd come along
When they gathered around and started talkin'
That's when Billy would take me walkin'
Out through the back yard we'd go walkin'
Then he'd look into my eyes
Lord knows to my surprise
--- Unknown ---
The only one who could ever reach me
Was the son of a preacher man
The only boy who could ever teach me
Was the son of a preacher man
Yes he was, he was, ooh, he was
--- Unknown ---
Bein' good isn't always easy
No matter how hard I try
When he started sweet-talkin' to me
He'd come and tell me everythings alright
He'd kiss and tell me everything is alright
Can I get away again tonight?
--- Unknown ---
The only one who could ever reach me
Was the son of a preacher man
The only boy who could ever teach me
Was the son of a preacher man
Yes he was, he was, ooh,lord no's he was
--- Unknown ---
How well I remember
The look that was in his eyes
Stealin' kisses from me on the sly
Takin' time to make time
Tellin' me that he's all mine
Learnin' from each other's knowin'
Lookin' to see how much we're growinâ€™

An the only one who could ever reach me was
A son of a preacher man
The only boy who could ever teach me
Was the son of a preacher man
Yes he was, he was, oh yes he was
The only one who could ever reach me
he was a sweet talkin'son of a preacher man
The only boy who could ever teach me
I guess he was the son of a preacher man
the only one was a sweet talkin' son of a preacher man
