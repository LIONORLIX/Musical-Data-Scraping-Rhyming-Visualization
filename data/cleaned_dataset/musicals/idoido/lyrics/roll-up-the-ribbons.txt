------ Roll Up the Ribbons ------
--- Unknown ---
He-Roll up the ribbons, fold up the papers
Stow all these things away!
This day is done, and another is on its way.
She-Pack up the present; look to the future.
One thing I know is true.
The best day of all is the day that is on its way.
Both-Waiting for you.
The best day of all is the day that is on its way.
She-Waiting for you.
He-Waiting for you.
