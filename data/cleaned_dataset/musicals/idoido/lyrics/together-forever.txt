From this moment forward, I promise to love thee;
I promise to love thee the rest of my life.
Both-Together forever, forever together.

ogether forever, forever together.
Through all of the sorrow - and happiness.

Forsaking all others, I offer my heart.
For richer, for poorer, to love and to comfort, to love and to comfort till death do us part.
