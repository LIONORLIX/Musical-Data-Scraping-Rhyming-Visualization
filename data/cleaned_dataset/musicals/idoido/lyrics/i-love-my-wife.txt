------ I Love My Wife ------
--- Unknown ---
I love my wife, what should I do?
I've been to see a specialist,
but when he was through -
he told me it's hopeless I'm stricken for life.
My son, He said,
Get back to bed, you happen to love your wife!
Other men love famous stars; but not I.
The sort you worship from afar; and I try.
Other men love femme fatales, sveltely dressed.
But when I'm with those femme fatales, I get depressed.
Cause - I love my wife.
How will it end?
I love her as a lover, and not just as a friend.
I may be abnormal, with drama it's rife -
But nevertheless - I confess - I - love - my wife!
