------ What Is a Woman? ------
--- Unknown ---
This is very strange.
Everything is changing.
Suddenly a door
Can slam.
--- Unknown ---
This is very strange.
Suddenly we're strangers.
And I start to wonder
Who I am.

What is a woman?
What is she made of?
Why is a woman afraid of
Not being in love?
--- Unknown ---
What is a woman?
What does she long for?
Why is it wrong for a woman
To be all alone?

Young girls are April
With rainbows and changes.
One day they grow up
And April is over forever
--- Unknown ---
To be a woman
Means being lonely.
That's why a woman is only
Alive when in love.
