------ The Honeymoon Is Over ------
--- Unknown ---
She-When your husband treats you like a piece of dirt -
When you find the purple lipstick on his shirt -
Then, my dear, it's clear the honeymoon is over,
And you'd better be on the alert!
He-When your wife decides that she should wear the pants -
When she gets your goat each time she gets the chance.
Then, my dear, it's clear the honeymoon is over,
And you'd better search for some romance!
Both-Time you saw your old, trusty lawyer.
As him whether you should find another nest to feather!
She-When you husband suddenly becomes the swell-
He-When you wife is bored by every joke you tell -
Both-Then, my dear, it's clear the honeymoon is over;
And you may as well; pack up, move out.
Tell him (her) Darling, fare thee well!
Time you saw your old, trusty lawyer.
As him whether you should find another nest to feather!
She-When your husband starts to play cherchez la femme -
He-When you wife is always ready to condemn -
Both-Then, my dear, it's clear the honeymoon is over -
And you may as well!
He-Play the scene out;
She-Make you exit;
He-Hit the climax;
She-Pull the curtain;
He-Pack up;
She-Move out;
Both-Tell him (her), Darling!
Together forever!
Looks more like it's never!
Fare- Thee- Well!
