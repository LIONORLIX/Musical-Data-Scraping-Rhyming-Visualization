------ Something Has Happened ------
--- Unknown ---
Something has happened.
Something new, as you can plainly see.
All at once there is someone else,
where once there was only me.
If I hold so still that my heart doesn't beat
He will sometimes kick me gently with his feet.
Oh - something has happened.
Something old.
But to me it is still so new.
