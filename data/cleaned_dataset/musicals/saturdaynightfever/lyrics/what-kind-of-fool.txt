------ What Kind Of Fool ------
--- Unknown ---
There was a time when i was
Down and out
There was a place when i was
Starting over
I let the bough break
I let the heartache in
Who's sorry now
--- Unknown ---
There was a world when i was
Standing still
And for a while was
Infatuated
And then he found me
I let the stranger in
Who's sorry now
--- Unknown ---
What, what kind of fool
Tears it apart
Leaving me pain and sorrow
Losing him know
Wondering why
Where will i be tomorrow
I'll be remembering when

What, what kind of fool
Tears it apart
Leaving me pain and sorrow
Losing him know
Wondering why

--- Unknown ---
Was there a moment
When i cut him down,
Played around
What have i done
I only apologise
For beeing as they say
The last to know
It has to show
When someone is in your eyes

What kind of fool
Tears it apart
Leaving me pain and sorrow
Losing him know
Wondering why
Where will i be tomorrow
What have i done
Who's sorry now
I've torn it apart
What kind of fool
Who's sorry now
