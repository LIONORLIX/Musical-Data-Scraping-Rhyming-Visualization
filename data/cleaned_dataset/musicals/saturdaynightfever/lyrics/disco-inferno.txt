To mass fires, yes! One hundred stories high
People gettin' loose y'all gettin' down on the roof - Do you hear?

It was so entertainin' - when the boogie started to explode
I heard somebody say

Satisfaction (uhu hu hu) came in the chain reaction
(burnin') I couldn't get enough, (till I had to self-destroy)so I had to
self destruct, (uhu hu hu)
The heat was on (burnin'), rising to the top, huh!
Everybody's goin' strong (uhu hu hu)
And that is when my spark got hot
I heard somebody say
