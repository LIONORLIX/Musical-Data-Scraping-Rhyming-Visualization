------ More Than a Woman ------
--- Unknown ---
Oh, girl Ive known you very well
Ive seen you growing everyday
I never really looked before
But now you take my breath away.
--- Unknown ---
Suddenly you're in my life
Part of everything I do
You got me working day and night
Just trying to keep a hold on you.
--- Unknown ---
Here in your arms I found my paradise
My only chance for happiness
And if I lose you now I think I would die.
--- Unknown ---
Oh say you'll always be my baby
We can make it shine, we can take forever
Just a minute at a time.
--- Unknown ---
More than a woman, more than a woman to me
More than a woman, more than a woman to me
More than a woman, oh, oh, oh.
--- Unknown ---
There are stories old and true
Of people so in love like you and me
And I can see myself
Let history repeat itself.
--- Unknown ---
Reflecting how I feel for you
Thinking about those people then
I know that in a thousand years
Id fall in love with you again.
--- Unknown ---
This is the only way that we should fly
This is the only way to go
And if I lose your love I know I would die.
--- Unknown ---
Oh say you'll always be my baby
We can make it shine, we can take forever
Just a minute at a time.
--- Unknown ---
More than a woman, more than a woman to me
More than a woman, more than a woman to me
