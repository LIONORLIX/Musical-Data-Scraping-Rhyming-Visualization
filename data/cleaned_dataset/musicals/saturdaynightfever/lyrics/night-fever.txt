------ Night Fever ------
--- Listen to the ground ---
There is movement all around
There is something goin' down
And I can feel it
--- Unknown ---
On the waves of the air
There is dancin' out there
If it's somethin' we can share
We can steal it
--- Unknown ---
And that sweet city woman
She moves through the light
Controlling my mind and my soul
When you reach out for me
Girl, and the feelin' is right
--- Unknown ---
Then I get night fever, night fever
We know how to do it
Gimme that night fever, night fever
We know how to show it
--- Unknown ---
Here I am
Prayin' for this moment to last
Livin' on the music so fine
Borne on the wind
Makin' it mine
--- Unknown ---
Night fever, night fever
We know how to do it
Gimme that night fever, night fever
We know how to show it
--- Unknown ---
In the heat of our love
Don't need no help for us to make it
Gimme just enough to take us to the mornin'
I got fire in my mind
I get higher in my walkin'
And I'm glowin' in the dark
I give you warnin'
--- Unknown ---
And that sweet city woman
She moves through the light
Controlling my mind and my soul
When you reach out for me
Girl, and the feelin' is right
--- Unknown ---
Then I get night fever, night fever
We know how to do it
Gimme that night fever, night fever
We know how to show it
--- Unknown ---
Here I am
Prayin' for this moment to last
Livin' on the music so fine
Borne on the wind
Makin' it mine
--- Unknown ---
Night fever, night fever
We know how to do it
Gimme that night fever, night fever
