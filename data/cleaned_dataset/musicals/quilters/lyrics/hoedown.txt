Here's a little bit of old school for ya,
That goes a little something like this...
--- Unknown ---
I always tried to be the flyest kid in the block
The popular one with the rising stocks
So that's when I had this bright idea
Throw the party of the month
No, the party of the year
--- Unknown ---
All the fine girls couldn't turn it down
Now all I gotta do is get my parents out
Should I send them to a movie
No, send them to a show
Let me think, hmmmmmm
It's gotta be long though
