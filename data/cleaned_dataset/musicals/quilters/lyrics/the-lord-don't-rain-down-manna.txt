------ The Lord Don't Rain Down Manna ------
--- Unknown ---
The lord don't rain down manna in my yard
Praise God from whom all blessings flow
The lord don't rain down manna, manna in my yard
Praise him all creatures here below
Praise him above ye heavenly host
Don't it though
Muddy waters overflow
The lord don't rain, don't rain down manna, it don't rain manna in my yard
