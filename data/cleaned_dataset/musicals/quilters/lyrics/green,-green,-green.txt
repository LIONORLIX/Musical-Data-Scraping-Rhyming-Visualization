------ Green, Green, Green ------
--- Unknown ---
Where I was born
Was... North Carolina
In a big, white house
With ivory pillars
--- Unknown ---
'Bout four of five chimneys
Keeping us warm
And acres and acres
*And hundreds
And thousands of acres
Of rolling green lawns
Oh the green, green green, of the rolling green lawns
--- Unknown ---
Where I was born
We had white picket fences
And the hills went rolling clear down to the road
And disappeared
And that great wooden house
Was like a ship on an ocean of green
And there's no green quite like it out here
Oh the green, green green, of the rolling green lawns
Oh the green, (Oh the green) of the rolling green lawns
