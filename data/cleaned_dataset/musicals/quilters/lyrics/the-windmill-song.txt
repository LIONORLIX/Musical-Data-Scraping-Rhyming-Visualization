------ The Windmill Song ------
--- Unknown ---
Wheel in the wheel in the wheel in the wheel, way in the middle of the air
Wheel in the wheel in the wheel in the wheel, way in the middle of the air
Wheel in the wheel in the wheel in the wheel, way in the middle of the air
Wheel in the wheel in the wheel in the wheel in the wheel
--- Unknown ---
Daddy's hand made a circle that cut a circle in the sky
Daddy's hand made a windmill
And up in the attic where we'd lie
--- Unknown ---
It seemed bigger than the moon
Or a wagon wheel
What a sight for our sore eyes
And we would drift to sleep
To the whirring lullabies
--- Unknown ---
Wheel in the wheel in the wheel in the wheel, way in the middle of the air
--- Unknown ---
Come on in, I'll spin you in a dream
Little prairie girl
--- Unknown ---
Wheel in the wheel in the wheel in the wheel, way in the middle of the air
--- Unknown ---
Daddy's mill made a circle
That joined the wind to the earth below
Giving life, pumping water
And causing all living things to grow
--- Unknown ---
Now me and June
Snuggling spoons
And oh, how many tunes it played
And we would drift to sleep
To the whirring of the blades
--- Unknown ---
Wheel in the wheel in the wheel in the wheel in the wheel

Come on Come on in,
I'll spin you in
A dream Let me spin
you in my
wooden arms
Ooh-ooh All around the
Ooh- wah world
Ooh-ooh Way in the
wah ooh middle of Daddy's hands
the air
Ooh-ooh
Ooh-wah
Ooh-ooh Way in the
wah ooh middle of Daddy's hands
the air
Ooh-ooh
Ooh-wah
Ooh-ooh Way in the
wah ooh middle of Daddy's hands
the air
