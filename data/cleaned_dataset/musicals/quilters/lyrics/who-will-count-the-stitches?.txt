------ Who Will Count the Stitches? ------
--- Unknown ---
Twenty-five years to make a comfort
That is longer lasting than a life
Twenty-five years I labored gladly
Who will count the stitches?
--- Unknown ---
Sarah the child and child bearer
The wife and woman I was taken for
--- Unknown ---
The stitches tell of all these and many Sarah's more
