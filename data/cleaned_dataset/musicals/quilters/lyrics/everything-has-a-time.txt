------ Everything Has a Time ------
--- Unknown ---
Every log in my house...
--- Unknown ---
Everything has a time
And early in the morning I
Am tending my flowers and grapevines
And when everything's properly done
It puts me in mind
To get to my quilting
And let the light shine
--- Unknown ---
Every log in my house, straight as a pine
Can grow...
--- Unknown ---
I've done my portion of creating
Trimming and weaving and cultivating
When everything within it's time
Is mended and tended
Then it puts me in mind
To get to my quilting
And let the light shine...
Dandelion carpet
Dandelion carpet
And let the light shine...
Dandelion...
