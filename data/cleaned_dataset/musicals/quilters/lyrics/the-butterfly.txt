------ The Butterfly ------
--- Unknown ---
There's a certain yellow light
And suddenly everything's quiet
And the dust came toward you
Rising and rolling
Wanting to wrap you inside it
--- Unknown ---
It was dark and cold when the sand hit
And you'd wake up buried alive
It was just like being dead
If not for my butterfly
--- Unknown ---
If not for my butterfly
--- Unknown ---
Aah, aah
Aah, aah
--- Unknown ---
Aah, aah
Aah, aah
--- Unknown ---
Out of the belly of Sheol to the sky
--- Unknown ---
