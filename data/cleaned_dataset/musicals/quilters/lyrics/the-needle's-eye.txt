------ The Needle's Eye ------
--- Unknown ---
A circle spinning faster
And getting larger all the time
A whirlpool spelled disaster
For all the people who don't rhyme
--- Unknown ---
Him who don't fit through the needle's eye
Him who just don't understand
Understand, understand, understand
--- Unknown ---
A brand new sense of freedom
A brand new sense of time
Him may go and stand alone now
And leave the hate and fear behind
--- Unknown ---
All the millions spent for killing
Seems the whole world must be dying
All the children who go hungry
How much food we could be buying
--- Unknown ---
Him who don't fit through the needle's eye
Him who just don't understand
Understand, understand, understand
--- Unknown ---
A brand new sense of freedom
A brand new sense of time
Him may go and stand alone now
And the leave the hate and fear behind
--- Unknown ---
People wake up every morning
And simply push their lives aside
They seem to carry all their feelings
Crushed and crumbled up inside
Inside, inside, inside
--- Unknown ---
Him who don't fit through the needle's eye
Him who just don't understand
--- Unknown ---
So I went to see my father
Many questions on my mind
But he didn't want to answer me
God, the whole world must be blind
--- Unknown ---
Him who don't fit through the needle's eye
Him may someday go insane
Insane, insane, insane
--- Unknown ---
Without a brand new sense of freedom
A brand new sense of time
Him may go and stand alone now
