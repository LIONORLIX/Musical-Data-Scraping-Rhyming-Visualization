------ Quiltin' and Dreamin' ------
--- Unknown ---
Settin' there under the quilting arbor
Of an afternoon in the spring
It was the fourteenth day of April
And the meadow larks did sing
--- Unknown ---
Thinking while quilting through blue, pink and purple
All the happy colors of my design
I must have had the wild prairie flowers
Somewhere in the back of my mind
--- Unknown ---
Quilting and dreaming a dream
On every stitch
Conjuring up a cowboy for my husband to be
Longing for to see him the one
Who'd lie dreaming underneath my lone star
With me
--- Unknown ---
Settin' there under the quilting arbor
Of an afternoon in the spring
--- Unknown ---
Laughing and blushing and pricking my fingers
Ripping out some crazy seams
--- Unknown ---
Quilting and dreaming a dream
On every stitch
--- Unknown ---
Conjuring up a cowboy strumming on a guitar
--- Unknown ---
Dreaming about the caring when two become one
Sharing life beneath my lone star
