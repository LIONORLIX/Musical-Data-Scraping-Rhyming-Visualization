------ Hands Around ------
--- Unknown ---
Hands, all hands around
Now lay on the healing hands
With no cross there is no crown
Oh sisters, sisters, spread the healing hands around
--- Unknown ---
Hands, all hands around
Blest be the tie that binds
Let all the hope in your working hands
Bring you sisters, sisters bring you peace of mind.
--- Unknown ---
Stretch them out (Stretch them out)
O'er troubled waters
Gather your strength
Daughters of Zion
Hold fast
Hold tight

At evening time there shall be light
*At evening time
At evening time
At evening time there shall be light
At evening time there shall
Be light!
Light! Light! Light!
