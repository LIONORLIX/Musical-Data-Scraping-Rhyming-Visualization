------ Land Where We'll Never Grow Old ------
--- Unknown ---
I have heard of a land
On a far away strand
It's a beautiful home of the soul
--- Unknown ---
Built by Jesus on high
Where we never shall die
It's a land where we'll never grow old
--- Unknown ---
Never grow old (where we'll)
Never grow old
In a land where we'll never grow old
Never grow old (where we'll)
Never grow old
In a land where we'll never grow old.

In that beautiful home
Where we'll nevermore roam
We shall be in that sweet by and by

Happy praise to the king
To eternity sing
