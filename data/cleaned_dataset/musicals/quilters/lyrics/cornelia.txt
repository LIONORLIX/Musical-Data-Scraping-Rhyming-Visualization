--- Unknown ---
For my Cornelia corncob doll
I found the longest cornsilk strands
And made her a right pine head of hair
And from the husks I made her floppy hands
*Whaddya think?
*It's good!
--- Unknown ---
I'd sit and pretty her up
'Till she's be sitting pretty
It was the morning and the evening of the first day.
--- Unknown ---
For my Cornelia corncob doll
I made a hat of dried sunflower
And then I'd gussie it up
With chicken feathers
I'd be hunting them for hours
*Whaddya think?
*It's good!
--- Unknown ---
Then I'd be painting her face
'Till she'd be quite the lady
It was the morning and the evening of the second day
It was the morning and the evening of the second day
--- Unknown ---
And then I'd fix up a frock from the piecing bag
From the scraps of my Sunday best
And then I'd quick
Whip up a Cornelius doll
And on the third day I'd get them wedded and blessed
--- Unknown ---
And come the morning and the evening of the
Fourth day
And of the
Fifth day
And of the
Sixth day
--- Unknown ---
There'd be dozens of nubbins for corncob babies
And come the seventh day they'd rest
--- Unknown ---
*So much begaggin'!
Ay, yi yi yi yi yi yi
--- Unknown ---
A new Cornelia corncob doll
Would be created every fall
And I could pretty much make her up pretty
From almost nothing
Nothing at all (From almost nothing at all)
--- Unknown ---
And I'd be primping her up
'Till she'd be tired of primping
Throughout the mornings and the evenings Every morning, every evening
Every morning, every evening
Every morning, every evening
Of the winter's day

La, la, la, la, la,
