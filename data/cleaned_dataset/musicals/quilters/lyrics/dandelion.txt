------ Dandelion ------
--- Unknown ---
Dandelion, why so late with your golden crown, with your golden crown?
All your comrades long ago laid their splendor down
Though your face smiles bravely up from the grasses dead, from the grasses dead,
Watching you, my heart forgets
Summer's wealth is fled
Blessings, blessings, little flower
For your shining grace
Doubly welcome that you deck
Autumn's furrowed face
Dandelion, like the dauntless heart you seem beneath privation's power
Smiling bravely though above the threatening tempests lower
Blessings, blessings, sunny flower,
For your shining grace
Doubly welcome that you deck
