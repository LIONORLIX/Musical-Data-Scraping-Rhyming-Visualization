------ Story of the Man in the Yellow Suit ------
--- The Man In The Yellow Suit ---
(spoken) Hold it right there, seventeen!
--- Jesse ---
(spoken) You.
--- The Man In The Yellow Suit ---
(spoken) Me! Where's your little friend?
Oh, who am I fooling? This wood is now mine.
--- Jesse ---
(spoken) What?
--- The Man In The Yellow Suit ---
(spoken) Why don't you show me what you've been hiding?
--- Jesse ---
(spoken) I have no idea what you're talking about.
--- The Man In The Yellow Suit ---
(spoken) That simply is not true.
(sung) Once upon a time, once upon a time
Started just like that!
My granny told me a story
How that woman loved to gab!
--- Jesse ---
(spoken) What does this have to do with me?
--- The Man In The Yellow Suit ---
(spoken) Only everything.
(sung) Said there was a man
With a wife and sons
And the story goes
Their beauty froze
Sound like anyone familiar?
Or should I take a stab?
--- Jesse ---
(spoken) You don't know a thing about me.
--- The Man In The Yellow Suit ---
(spoken) I know you know where
the spring is so why don't you show it to me?
--- Jesse ---
(spoken) Miles! It's him! This is the man!
--- Miles ---
(spoken) Hold it right there!
--- Mae ---
(spoken) Miles, no!
--- The Man In The Yellow Suit ---
(spoken) Oh my god.
It's all of ya! The tale's come to life,
Just like my granny said!
--- Jesse ---
(spoken) Ma, he knows the secret!
--- The Man In The Yellow Suit ---
(spoken) And I've been guarding it with my life!
(sung) My lips are sealed
Granny didn't raise a snitch!
I can make you filthy rich!
We'll bottle the water and sell it for a fee
Split the profit equally
--- Angus ---
(spoken) You're mad! We would never!
--- Mae ---
(spoken) We just want to live our lives in peace!
--- The Man In The Yellow Suit ---
(spoken) What is wrong with you people?!
(sung) You could be sultans!
You could have kingdoms!
Did you not think of this before?
If you could put a price on eternal life,
They'd pay anything and more!
(spoken) Just lead me to the water!
--- Jesse ---
(spoken) Here! Take this vial! Just let her go!
--- The Man In The Yellow Suit ---
(spoken) Oh my god. There it is.
(sung) Today is the day...
--- Jesse ---
(spoken) You take this...
--- The Man In The Yellow Suit ---
(sung) The waiting is over...
--- Jesse ---
(spoken) And, I'll show you the spring...
--- The Man In The Yellow Suit ---
(sung) The answer's so simple.
So perfectly pure...
--- Jesse ---
(spoken) Please, let her go.
--- The Man In The Yellow Suit ---
(sung) The secret to eternal life
And now, I'll never-
--- Mae ---
