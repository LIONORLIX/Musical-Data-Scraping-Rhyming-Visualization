------ Time ------
--- Miles ---
I had a farm house with a grandfather clock
Where I would teach time to my son
Our lessons began at twelve o'clock sharp
When the hands would come in as one
--- Unknown ---
I'd say the big hand counts minutes
It's so tightly wound
It chases the small hand
To make hours go round
--- Unknown ---
I taught Thomas constellations in the sky
To tell a silver maple from a cotton wood
I taught Thomas to divide and multiply
But one he never understood was time
--- Unknown ---
As I watched him grow, time
He would never know time
For my regret resides time
If I only knew the what and how and who
That time truly divides
--- Unknown ---
There was a farmhouse with a grandfather clock
Where one day I woke up alone
They feared I was magic
They feared I was cursed
But mostly they feared the unknown
--- Unknown ---
The big hands the father
The small hands the son
And there never came a time
When they came back as one
--- Unknown ---
I taught Thomas how to catch a firefly
How to make a pebble skip and rowboat skim
She took Thomas and never said goodbye
The one thing I could never give to him
--- Unknown ---
Was time, time
I'm left with nothing
Nothing but time
--- Winnie ---
Miles, I don't have a father anymore
--- Miles ---
You don't?
--- Winnie ---
No. But i will always love him. For the rest of my life.
And I promise Thomas will love you for the rest of his.
