------ Top of the World ------
--- JESSE ---
Watch my every step
Find a sturdy branch
Don't you dare look down
Pull your body up
Dig in your heels
Let's see what this tree reveals!
Just a few more feet
Almost at the top
Watch the robins nest
Pull your body up 'till you've broken through
Let's see if this tree has a view!
At the top, at the top,
At the top of the world you're drawing back a curtain
At the top, at the top,
At the top of the world there you know for certain
You're alive and you are free,
So follow me to the top of the world
Mountains to the west,
An ocean to the east,
Storm clouds to the north ready to pour
Every sycamore leaves me wanting more and more
At the top, at the top,
At the top of the world my head and heart are pounding
At the top, at the top,
At the top of the world I hear my voice resounding
I'm alive and I am free so look at me,
WINNIE:
but you gotta see it to believe it
--- JESSE ---
And believe me I've seen it
The frontier of the upper atmosphere
--- WINNIE ---
a wonder to behold it
--- JESSE ---
A story yet untold it's up here,
--- WINNIE ---
up here,
--- JESSE ---
up here!
--- Both ---
Up here!
--- JESSE ---
I'll go out on a limb,
Walk a tightrope wire for the highest height
Yes I'll risk it all
Give me a barrel
Guess who'll find a waterfall
--- JESSE & WINNIE ---
At the top, at the top,
At the top of the world my head and heart are pounding
At the top, at the top,
At the top of the world I hear my voice resounding
Iâ€™m alive and I am free so look at me at the TOP of the world!
