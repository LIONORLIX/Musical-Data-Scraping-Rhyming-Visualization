------ Join the Parade ------
--- The Man in the Yellow Suit and Carnies ---
Join the parade, fall in line for the fair.
Before the sun sets, before we roll on.
Ladies and gents, our Midway presents
A tonic for the woebegone!
--- The Man in the Yellow Suit ---
Come to the fair, the best day of the year.
They say it won't last, and sonny, they're right!
A merriment maker, fill in an acre -
--- The Man in the Yellow Suit and Carnies ---
