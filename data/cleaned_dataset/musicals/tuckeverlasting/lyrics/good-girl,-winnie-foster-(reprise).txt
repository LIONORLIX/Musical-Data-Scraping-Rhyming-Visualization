------ Good Girl, Winnie Foster (Reprise) ------
--- Winnie ---
With a cage for a yard you can only mope in
When a front door shuts,
Should a gate open?
If I don't leave now I'll only wish I had
How can I know good without trying bad?
To think I'd never seem I would,
I've gotta get out,
While the getting's good.
