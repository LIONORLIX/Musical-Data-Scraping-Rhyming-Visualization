------ My Most Beautiful Day ------
--- (MAE) ---
Every grown woman
who stands at a mirror
remembers one beautiful day
--- Unknown ---
every girl past her prime
knows the date and the time
she looked most exquisite
and she will revisit, revisit, revisit that day
--- Unknown ---
her most beautiful day
for the rest of her life
--- Unknown ---
my most beautiful day
pa took me dancing
everything fell into place
--- Unknown ---
my hair tied like so
with a blackberry bow
a night in november
that i will remember, remember, remember that day
--- Unknown ---
my most beautiful day
for the rest of my life
--- Unknown ---
each memory
a sweet melody
the heart clings to
each passing day
what time takes away
the heart makes new
looking back
looking back is something to look forward to
--- Unknown ---
your most beautiful day
for the rest of your life
--- Unknown ---
love unlike beauty
or dresses
or dances
won't wrinkle or thicken with time
--- Unknown ---
to be loved you will learn
is to love in return
find someone you care for
--- Unknown ---
and winnie prepare for
prepare for, prepare for that day
--- Unknown ---
your most beautiful day, for the rest of your life
--- Unknown ---
your most beautiful day
for the rest of your
life
