------ It's Alive ------
--- Jonny ---
Now i'm back and boy i'm ready.
Ev'rything is crystal clear.
Gonna get me my diploma
And complete my senior year!
--- Unknown ---
Gonna come back to my senses,
Smell the roses, mend the fences.
Make the world think better of me.
All i need is someone to love me.
Toffee, take me back!
Toffee, take me back!
--- Miss strict ---
Good heavens!
Jonny warner --
Back from the dead!
It's alive!!
--- Kids ---
Uh-huh!
--- Miss strict ---
Lord, would you look at this creature feature.
What a disgusting display.
Check out this nightmare that rose with the moon,
Straight from the depths of the black lagoon.
Cover your popcorn and duck!
Frankenstein's running amok!
--- Kids ---
It's alive!
It's alive!
--- Jonny ---
Who'd have ever guessed
I had a soul to revive?
My body falls to pieces,
But my spirit starts to thrive.
For the first time in my life --
--- Kids ---
It's alive!
--- Miss strict ---
Now, listen to me, jonny warner,
Lord knows why you've come.
But whatever it is, you'd better leave.
I've no patience for zombie scum.
--- Jonny ---
Tell you miss strict, i used to hate you.
I could not be reached.
But now that i'm back, i see the wisdom
In all you taught and preached.
--- Unknown ---
Now i'm back
And i'm right on track,
Got my head on straight.
Went astray
Then i saw the way.
I'm set to graduate-ate-ate!
Went astray,
Then i saw the way.
I pray i'm not too late!
