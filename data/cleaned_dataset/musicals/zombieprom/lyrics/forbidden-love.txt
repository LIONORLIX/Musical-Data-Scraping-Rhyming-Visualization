------ Forbidden Love ------
--- Toffee ---
Forbidden love.
Let them all stare
I haven't a care, since i found you,
My forbidden love.
How could i not be true?
You gave me my freedom,
Then sent me off flying.
There's no denying
Our forbidden love....
--- Jonny ---
...forbidden love.
Let them all laugh,
They'll never know half the love we know,
My forbidden love.
Where would you have me go?
I'd follow you blindly.
Toffee:
Now and forever.
Jonny:
Straight past the sunrise.
Toffee:
And onward till morning.
Both:
All my dreams come...
--- Kids ---
Let 'em come cause we'll be ready,
Hangin' tight and holdin' steady.
True love cannot be hidden.
Let 'em try to sway and sell us.
Doesn't matter what they tell us.
--- Jonny & toffee ---
They're only jealous
Of...
--- Unknown ---
Our forbidden love.
Let them all laugh,
They'll never know half the love we know,
My forbidden love.
Toffee:
Where would you have me go?
Jonny:
Where would you have me go?
Toffee:
I'd follow you blindly.
Jonny:
Now and forever.
--- Toffee ---
Straight past the sunrise.
Jonny:
And onward till morning.
Both:
All of my dreams come true.
Jonny:
All my dreams...
Toffee:
To the dawn...
Jonny:
Evermore...
Toffee:
On and on...
Both:
My forbidden love.
