------ Good as It Gets ------

--- Unknown ---
Isn't it great to be a senior?
Isn't it cool to be high strung?
Isn't it hot to have a steady?
Isn't it tops just being young?
Bein' a kid is havin' it easy,
No hassles, no regrets.
Isn't it great, cool, hot, tops, hip?
Yeah, this is as good as it gets!

(toffee enters, dressed in black.)
--- Boys ---
There goes toffee,
--- Girls ---
Dressed in black again.
--- Kids ---
Hoping against all hope
That jonny comes back again....
She's a teen-
Teen-
Teen-
Teen-ager in mourning,
From the morning light
To that last dismissal bell.
Just a teen-
Teen-
Teen-
Teen-ager in mourning.
--- Unknown ---
Where once the girl was effervescent,
She's now a poster-child depressant,
A problematic post-pubescent,
A convalescing adolescent,
A teenager in hell!
--- Candy ---
Hey, look, toffee.  The senior prom.  Ain't it swell?
--- Toffee ---
I won't be going to my senior prom.
--- Coco ---
Why not toffee?
--- Toffee ---
Because i haven't got a boyfriend...anymore!
--- Joey ---
Jeez, toffee.  Lighten up.
--- Josh ---
It's been three whole weeks.
--- All ---
Isn't it great?
Isn't it cool?
Isn't it hot?
Isn't it tops?
--- Toffee ---
I've got no boyfriend.
That's my fate.
I've got no future.
I've got no date!
--- Kids ---
Bein' a kid is havin' it easy,
No hassles, no regrets.
--- Girls ---
Isn't it great, cool, hot, tops, hip...?
--- Boys ---
And isn't it swell, neat, keen, wild, fab...?
--- Kids ---
Yeah!
--- Toffee ---
Is this as good as it...?
--- Kids ---
This is as good as it gets!
