------ Blast from the Past ------
--- Kids ---
Holey moley!
Jonny:
Lazarus has risen
From a sea-bound sunken cage!
Kids:
Heaven help us!
Jonny:
Fresh from the atom
And the modern age...!
--- Unknown ---
I'm a blast from the past.
I'm a force for the future.
A teen-age zombie, an acquired taste,
Oxy-clear and toxic waste.
I'm a blast, blast, blast --
From the all too recent past!
--- Kids ---
Tales of terror!
Jonny:
Let's hear it for the mutant,
I'm a living proton boom!
Kids:
House of horrors!
Jonny:
Back like a demon
From beyond the tomb...!
--- Unknown ---
I'm a blast from the past.
I'm the fire from the fusion.
A toxic student with a shocking tale,
Shaking up the geiger scale.
I'm a blast, blast, blast --
Kids:
From the all too recent past!
--- Jonny ---
Did you miss your buried boyfriend?
Cry yourself to sleep at night?
Come and kiss your monster mister.
Plug me in a watch me light!
--- Jonny ---
Step right up and see me ladies;
Now appearing straight from hades!
Get dolled up and haute cuisine me,
Hold me tight and carbon fourteen me!
--- Unknown ---
I'm a blast from the past.
--- Unknown ---
I'm a ghost from the graveyard.
--- Unknown ---
A senior riding the atomic tide
Of root beer floats and formaldehyde.
I'm a blast, blast, blast ---
--- Kids ---
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
Blast from the past.
Ghost from the graveyard.
Ooh!
Aah!
--- Kids ---
He's a blast from the past.
He's a force for the future.
A teenage zombie, an acquired taste,
Oxy-clear and toxic waste.
He's a blast, blast, blast ---
Aah, aah, aah, aah --
--- Jonny ---
From the all too recent past!
