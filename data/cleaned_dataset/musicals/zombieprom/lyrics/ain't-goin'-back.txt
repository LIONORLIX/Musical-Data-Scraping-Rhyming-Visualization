Jonny
Toffee, toffee...
--- Unknown ---
Josh
C'mon, jonny. All fours!
--- Unknown ---
Toffee
Jonny, jonny...
--- Unknown ---
One moment with you
And i suddenly know
The difference one moment can make.
Jonny
The rush of the lunchroom,
The sirens, the glow,
The smell of the...sal'sbury steak.
Both
Magic surrounds us.
Don't you see?
This love is destined to be.
--- Unknown ---
Kids
It's another day,
It's just another day....
--- Unknown ---
Toffee
Homecoming dance coming up, jonny.
--- Unknown ---
Jonny
I don't know, toffee. I've never been to a dance before. I wouldn't know how.
--- Unknown ---
Toffee
And i would? I just...i just want everyone to know you're with me...
--- Unknown ---
The days turn to weeks,
Still our love doesn't stop.
The months turn from summer to fall.
Jonny
We pour out our hearts
In the notes that we swap,
In glances exchanged in the hall.
--- Unknown ---
Both
Magic surrounds us.
Don't you see?
This love is destined to be.
--- Unknown ---
Kids
It's another day,
Another day...
--- Unknown ---
Toffee
And i know we said we wouldn't exchange gifts...but i want you to have this.
--- Unknown ---
Jonny
You shouldn't have. Oh, but i'm glad you did. 'Cause i want you to have this.
(holding out his jacket to her) go on. Take it.
--- Unknown ---
Toffee
Jonny! It's your no h jacket! Are you asking me to go steady?
--- Unknown ---
Jonny
I'm not good with speeches, toffee. I grew up an orphan.
I didn't have all the things the other kids had.
No mom, no dad...no fancy birthday parties with ice cream and cake....
--- Unknown ---
Toffee
Oh, jonny...
--- Unknown ---
Jonny
You're the first person who's ever loved me. It would kill me to think this wasn't forever.
--- Unknown ---
Toffee
Oh, jonny. Of course i'll go steady with you.
I love you! And there's nothing that can ever change
That!
--- Unknown ---
Both
As boundless as the heavens,
Eternal as the soul,
As destined as the sunset
When the credits start to roll.
As certain as the starlight
When the day has gone to black.
Yes, it's said and done.
Our souls are one.
And there ain't no goin' back,
No, no, there ain't no goin' back.
There ain't no goin' back!
--- Unknown ---
Kids
It's another day...
--- Unknown ---
Candy
Oh, gosh, toff! Couldn't you die?! One more semester and we're out for good.
I'm holding on by my fingernails, toffee! By my fingernails! Wanna see?
--- Unknown ---
Jonny and toffee
As boundless as the heavens,
--- Unknown ---
Eternal as the soul,
--- Unknown ---
As destined as the sunset
--- Unknown ---
When the credits start to roll.
--- Unknown ---
As certain as the starlight
--- Unknown ---
When the day has gone to black.
Yes, it's said and done.
Our souls are one.
--- Unknown ---
And there ain't no goin' back, no, no, there
Ain't no goin' back.
There ain't no goin' back,
No, no there ain't no goin' back.
There ain't no goin back...!
Kids
--- Unknown ---
D'you hear the latest?
--- Unknown ---
Jonny and toffee...
--- Unknown ---
They're goin' steady!
--- Unknown ---
Over a month now!
--- Unknown ---
Ain't it the greatest?
Oh,
Yes, it's said and done.
Their souls are one.
--- Unknown ---
Ain't no goin' back.
Ain't no goin' back.
Ain't no goin' back.
Ain't no goin' back.
Ain't no goin' back...!
