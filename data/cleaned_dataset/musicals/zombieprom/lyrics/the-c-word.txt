------ The C Word ------
--- Voice ---
Toffee, toffee....
--- Ginger ---
Study hall, toff.
Get your homework.
--- Coco ---
Whatcha got today?
--- Toffee ---
Nothin' but math.
What's the whoop?
I mean, who uses math anyway?
--- Candy ---
But i thought you wanted to be
A nuclear whatsits crackerjack.
--- Toffee ---
What does it matter?
Nothing i do
Will ever bring jonny back.
Nothing will bring my jonny back....
--- Girls ---
Life is rough,
But enough's enough.
More's in store for you.
You loved jon
But he's come and gone,
And you still are goin' boo-hoo-hoo.
You loved jon,
But you must move on.
You know he'd want you to.
--- Voice ---
Toffee, toffee...
--- Toffee ---
What was that?
--- Ginger ---
Toffee?
--- Candy ---
What's the matter with you?
--- Toffee ---
Ev'ry now and then
I hear his voice,
Hear my darlin' jon.
Ev'ry now and then
I see his face.
Yeah, he's dead but he ain't gone....
--- Jake ---
Toffee, i know,
We all miss jonny.
But come back to the ground....
--- Joey ---
Gotta cheer up,
He only died....
--- Josh ---
Hey, it's not like he's screwing around...
--- Candy ---
Josh!  Honestly!!
--- Ginger ---
What kind of thing is that to say to someone who just drove her boyfriend to suicide?
--- Coco ---
Ginger's right.  Jonny's a dead subject.
--- Candy ---
Besides who can think of anything else with the prom just around the corner?
--- Toffee ---
Listen to you all!  Someone died, and all you're worrying about is who to take to the stupid old prom!
As if any of that matters!
--- Candy ---
Oh, toffee, you're just upset.  You can't mean that.
--- Jake ---
We've gotta keen theme this year.
--- Joey ---
An evening of miracles and molecules...
--- Coco ---
What could be more important than the prom?
--- Ginger ---
And you'll be a shoo-in for prom queen, toffee.
--- Josh ---
You'll get the sympathy vote!
--- Kids ---
Ugh!
--- Josh ---
What?!
--- Toffee ---
Life's a trap
Of the same old crap.
No such thing as new.
--- Ginger ---
The c word.  She said the c word.
--- Toffee ---
Moms and pops,
And senior hops,
And who is dating who-who-who.
Fall to spring,
It's the same old thing --
It's crap the whole year through!
--- Ginger ---
Twice!  She said it twice!
--- Toffee ---
It's crap the whole year....
--- Ginger ---
Three times!
--- Unknown ---
(miss strict who has entered behind them and heard the whole discussion, blows her whistle.)
--- Miss strict ---
That will be quite enough out of you, missy!
--- Ginger ---
She used the c word, miss strict.  The really bad one:  rhymes with map.
--- Miss strict ---
Thank you, ginger.
--- Toffee ---
Snitch!
--- Miss strict ---
Toffee!  Child!  What sort of insanity is this?!
Perhaps, what you need is a little reminder of what enrico fermi high is all about!
The school motto, children...?!
--- Boys ---
Rules!
--- Girls ---
Regulations!
--- Miss strict ---
And...?
--- All ---
Respect!!
