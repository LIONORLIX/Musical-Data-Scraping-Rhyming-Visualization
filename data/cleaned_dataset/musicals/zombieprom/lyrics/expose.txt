--- Eddie ---
Delilah strict...!
--- Miss strict ---
Oh god, not you again....
--- Eddie ---
You're looking scrumptious tonight....
--- Unknown ---
(she walks over to him.  Then slaps him.  Hard.)
--- Miss strict ---
Are you satisfied, flagrante?
Have you got what you desired?
You're destroying all i've worked for
With this frenzy you've inspired!
--- Eddie ---
Ain't it funny how things happen?
Can this really be by chance?
After all the time gone by...
...we fin'lly made it to the dance.
--- Miss strict ---
Too little, too late, flagrante!
--- Eddie ---
You know i do believe the last time we were together was in a high school, very much like this.
--- Miss strict ---
Correction.  The last time we were together was in the back seat of your father's studebaker.
You were such a bad boy...
--- Eddie ---
And you were such a good girl -- on the outside.
But i always knew there was a blazing inferno beneath the icy exterior.
One day you were bound to melt, and when you did, i wanted to be there to lick up the puddle...
--- Unknown ---
I enjoyed the constant battles,
Though the odds were none to slim.
And i still recall those tussles
'Neath the bleachers in the gym.
--- Unknown ---
All the steam...
All the sweat...
--- Miss strict ---
There are some things we'd be better to forget....
--- Eddie ---
Do you remember french class, mon cher?
Miss strict:
Yes, i recall that french class affair.
Eddie:
Oh, to be wild and young.
Miss strict:
Exploring a foreign tongue.
Eddie:
I left ev'ry day from french class
More certain than before,
That under your je ne sais quoi --
I'd find l'amour!
--- Unknown ---
Tell me my love, does glee club ring a bell?
Miss strict:
Yes, i remember glee club, too well.
Eddie:
Reason gave way to rhyme.
Miss strict:
Rapture in four/four time.
Eddie:
There in the heat of glee club,
Passions were expressed.
For music, it never quite soothed --
Your savage breast!
--- Unknown ---
Expose', my love,
Expose'.
I remember it well;
It was heaven and hell,
The games that we'd play.
Expose', my love,
Expose'.
Miss strict:
You tore me apart.
Eddie:
You stomped on my heart.
Both:
Then cast me away.
Expose'!
--- Eddie ---
Then came the joys of art class at noon.
Miss strict:
Just hearing you speak of art class, i swoooooon.
Eddie:
There we knew no restraints.
Miss strict:
Dripping in temp'ra paints.
Eddie:
Surrounded by works romantic,
Secrets were disclosed.
Leaving your feelings stripped bare --
And you exposed!
--- Miss strict ---
You liked to neck during football games.
Eddie:
One little pass and you'd blush.
Miss strict:
You tried so hard for a touchdown.
Eddie:
You longed for the offensive rush.
Both:
And oh, the excitement,
The thrill of the scene.
Eddie:
The sight of your pom-poms!
Miss strict:
And the smell of brilliantine!
--- Both ---
Expose', my love,
Expose'.
I remember it well;
It was heaven and hell
The games that we'd play.
Expose'
My love,
Expose'.
Miss strict:
You tore me apart!
Eddie:
You stomped on my heart!
Both:
Then cast me away!
Expose'!
Expose'!
Expose'!
