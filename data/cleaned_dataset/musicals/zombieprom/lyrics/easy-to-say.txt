------ Easy to Say ------
--- Toffee ---
Finding the slope of x and y,
And jonny's there.
Adding the root of z times pi,
And jonny's there.
Finals approaching,
But what's the use?
How can find the hypotenuse,
Mixed up as i am
With thoughts of you?
Oh, what am i going to do?
What am i going to do?
--- Unknown ---
Easy to say,
I should leave him behind,
Open my eyes,
Sever the ties,
And try to unwind.
Ev'ry one says
I should make up my mind.
Easy to say,
But, oh --
Jon without a h,
You're a hard one to let go.
--- Unknown ---
Easy to say,
That we're done with the dance.
Let the curtain descend,
And bring to an end
This one-act romance.
Easy to know,
There was never a chance.
Time to let go,
And yet --
Jon without an h,
You're a hard guy to forget.
--- Unknown ---
How can you study for this exam?
Is there an answer to love?
Is it a, what i know, or b, what i feel?
Why can't it be all the above?

Did i see it?  How could i miss it?  He was on all three channels.
Oh, what's a girl to do when her dead ex-boyfriend asks her to the prom...??
--- Girls ---
You left jonny,
Now, you're feeling low,
'Cause whether he's dead or not,
He certainly loves you so.
How he loves you,
Oh, it's a...

Though it's plain to see
That it's you he's dreaming of.

Toffee:
Who will my escort for the prom be,
Now that the boy-next door's a zombie?
Girls:

But even death can't steal the thunder
Toffee & girls:

Oh, and he really does love me, doesn't he?

Girls:
Easy to say,
Toffee:
I should give up the ghost.

You will always...
