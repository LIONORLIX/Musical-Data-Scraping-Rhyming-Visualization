------ Trio (Case Closed) ------
--- Eddie ---
Ok, zombie boy!  Time to face the press....
--- Miss strict ---
And another thing, mr. Warner....
--- Unknown ---
(eddie and miss strict spot each other and are thunderstruck.)
--- Eddie ---
Delilah strict!?
Miss strict:
Eddie flagrante!?
Both:
It's been a very long time...!
--- Unknown ---
(oblivious of everything, they begin to move toward each other as if in a trance, when...)
--- Josh ---
You two know each other?
--- Miss strict ---
Get to class!  All of you!
--- Eddie ---
It's been many years, delilah.
Always knew we'd meet again.
Never knew exactly where
And not a clue as to the when.
--- Miss strict ---
After all you put me through,
The tragic scene that came to play,
After all that happened then....
Eddie:
What?
Miss strict:
Well, i...
I don't have time for this today!
--- Eddie ---
So i see.
What's the scoop?
There's no limit to the depths to which i'll stoop!
--- Miss strict ---
What we have here is an issue
With a controversial bent.
If i break once with tradition
I'll have set a precedent.
--- Unknown ---
If we let him come to roost here
Then this zombie clique will thrive.
And he wasn't all that special
Even when he was alive.
--- Unknown ---
Case is closed,
Shut air tight.
It's all there as plain as day in black and white!
--- Eddie ---
Well, i hate to disagree, love,
But this stinks to holy heights.
You're denying him his due.
This is a case of civil rights!
--- Unknown ---
He belongs!
Miss strict:
Don't be dense!
Eddie:
God, you're gorgeous when you're tense....
Jonny:
May i speak in my defense...?
--- Unknown ---
Here's the situation, ma'am,
I'm talking honest pool.
I just want an education, ma'am.
I want to go to school.
Looks can be deceiving, ma'am,
Well, what with all i did.
Beneath all the trauma
I'm still just a kid.
Eddie:
Beneath all the trauma
He's still just a kid.
--- Jonny ---
One more point concerning
How my character's in doubt;
I'm planning on returning,
While the norm is dropping out.
I have no hope of leaving, ma'am,
I thought you understood.
Beneath all the gangrene
I'm basically good.
Eddie:
Beneath all the gangrene
He's basically good.
--- Miss strict ---
Rule number 7,
Subsection 9,
Of the handbook of student life says --
No zombies!
No zombies!
Get that through your head.
No monsters!
No mutants!
No satanic walking dead!
--- Eddie ---
Deli...
Miss strict:
Hey!
Eddie:
miss strict, i mean,
Let's be honest here.
Put our cards out on the table.
Let us persevere.
Jonny:
I want to come back!
Miss strict:
And i won't let you!
Eddie:
Well, that's clear.
--- Unknown ---
(to himself)
What we have here is a candidate
For hero of the day.
He could eas'ly be the cover-boy
For next week's expose'.
--- Unknown ---
But beyond the fame and glory
There's a point here to be made.
Equal rights for the undead
Could be a national crusade!
--- Unknown ---
I'm the match.
He's the fuse.
Put together, we could make the network news!
--- Miss strict ---
Heaven knows how first he got here,
But he's leaving through that door.
If this freak wants his diploma
That's what cath'lic schools are for.
--- Jonny ---
All i want
Is a break.
After all i've got my afterlife at stake...
--- Unknown ---
(all sung simultaneously)
--- Jonny ---
Here's the situation, ma'am,
I'm talking honest pool.

--- All ---
Heaven only knows where this will
Lead to when exposed --
Eddie:
Top story!
Jonny:
My future!
Miss strict:
No zombies!
All:
Case closed!!
