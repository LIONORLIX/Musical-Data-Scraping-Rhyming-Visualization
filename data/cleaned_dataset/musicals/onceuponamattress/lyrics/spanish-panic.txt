(At the end of the dance everyone collapses except Winnifred. "Let's do it again,"
she announces. Afterwards, she asks Dauntless for a clue about what the test might be.
He doesn't know, but he knows (hopes) she will pass)

Winnifred: By the way, Dauntless, I don't think I ever told you?
my full name is Winnifred the Woebegone. But Winnifred's too formal.
You can call me by my nickname.
Dauntless: Winnie?
Winnifred: Fred.
