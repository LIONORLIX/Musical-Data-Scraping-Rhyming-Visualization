------ I Cain't Say No ------
--- Annie ---
It ain't so much a question of not knowin' what to do
I knowed what's right an' wrong since I been ten.
I heared a lot of stories an' I reckon they are true
About how girls are put upon by men.
I know I mustn't fall into the pit
But when I'm with a feller, I fergit!
--- Unknown ---
I'm just a girl who cain't say 'No'
I'm in a terrible fix!
I always say 'Come on, let's go'
just when I oughta say 'Nix.'
When a person tries to kiss a girl
I know she oughta give his face a smack!
But as soon as someone kisses me
I somehow sorta wanna kiss him back!
I'm just a fool when lights are low
I cain't be prissy an' quaint
I ain't the type that can faint
How can I be what I ain't?
I cain't say 'No!'

Whatcha gonna do when a feller gets flirty
An' starts to talk purty
Whatcha gonna do?
Sposin' that he says
That your lips are like cherries,
Or roses, or berries?
Whatcha gonna do?
Sposin' that he says
That yer sweeter 'n cream
and he's gotta have cream or die?
Whatcha gonna do when he talks that way?
Spit in his eye?

I'm jist a girl who cain't say 'No',
Cain't seem to say it at all
I hate to disserpoint a beau
When he is payin' a call!
Fer a while I ack refined and cool,
A settin on the velveteen setee
Nen I think of thet ol' Golden Rule,
And do fer him what he would do fer me!
I cain't resist a Romeo
In a sombrero and chaps
Soon as I sit on their laps
Somethin' inside of me snaps
I cain't say 'No'!
--- Additional Verse ---
I'm jist a girl who cain't say 'No'
Kissin's my favorite food!
With or without the mistletoe
I'm in a holiday mood!
Other girls are coy an' hard to catch
But other girls ain't havin' any fun!
Ev'ry time I lose a wrastlin' match
I have a funny feelin' that I won!
Though I can feel the undertoe
I never make a complaint
Till it's too late for restraint
Then when I want to, I cain't
