------ Many a New Day ------
--- Laurey ---
Why should a woman who is healthy and strong
Blubber like a baby if her man's goes away?
A weepin' an' a whalin' that he's done her wrong
That's one thing you'll never hear me say!
Never gonna think that the man I lose is the only man among men!
I'll snap my fingers to show I don't care
I'll buy me a brand new dress to wear
I'll scrub my neck
And I'll brush my hair
And start all over again!

Many a new face will please my eye
Many a new love will find me
Never have I once looked back to sigh
Over the romance behind me
Many a new day will dawn before I do!
--- Unknown ---
Many a like lad may kiss and fly
A kiss gone by is bygone.
Never have I asked an August sky
Where has last July gone?
Never have I wandered through the rye
Wondering where has some guy gone?
Many a new day will dawn before I do.

Many a new face will please my eye
Many a new love will find me
Never have I once looked back to sigh
Over the romance behind me
Many a new day will dawn before I do!

Never have I chased the honeybee
Who carelessly cajoled me
Somebody jist as sweet as he
Cheered me and consoled me.
Never have I wept into my tea
Over the deal someone doled me
--- Girls ---
Many a new day will dawn
--- Laurey ---
Many a red sun will set
Many a blue moon will shine
Before I do!

Many a new face will please my eye
Many a new love will find me
Never have I once looked back to sigh
Over the romance behind me
Many a new day will dawn before I do!
