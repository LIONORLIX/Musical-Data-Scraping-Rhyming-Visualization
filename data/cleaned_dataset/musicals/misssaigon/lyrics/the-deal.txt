My friend
We had a deal for Kim, but that's on ice
I'm sorry, sergeant, but I've changed the price
I need a visa from your embassy
You get me that, you'll get the girl for free
--- CHRIS ---
Cut the crap, this money's all I got
I don't give visas out.
Is this a deal or not?
You tell me
--- CHRIS draws his revolver and aims at the ENGINEER ---
--- ENGINEER ---
Okay, okay, the money...it will do
Too bad, I had a Rolex watch for you
I'll get my papers in another way
I'll make a rich man of some attache
--- CHRIS leaves ---
--- Unknown ---
With little shits like him, you take the bucks and run
