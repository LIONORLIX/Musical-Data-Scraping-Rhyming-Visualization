John: I'm not as a friend. I have a job to do.
It's strange to find my work should lead me here to you.
Chris know all anout you, I have shown him all this.
But I think that it's time you know all about Chris.
--- Unknown ---
Kim: Please, don't you see that's all I live for. I have him, and nothing more.
Every night, evrything that's not him, disappears behind my door.
--- Unknown ---
John: Please, he went crazy when he lost you. Spoke to no one for a year.
Then he finally said, I'm home now. My life has to go one here.
Please, let me finish talking please. This was three whole years ago.
--- Unknown ---
Kim: Yes. Yes, I know.
I know how pain can grow when the rock you hold onto is a love miles away.
Listen, please, I already know this story. Take us to the USA.

John: When we're finished here you'll see him. Chris arrived with me today.
--- Unknown ---
Kim: Oh, Tam, he's here! He's here,
he's so near we might breathe the same air tonight!
Your father's here!
O Tam it's true. My dream was right. You'll see him soon.
Please, can't you see we've been watched over as we've crossed the wildest seas.
Even God wants us together, can I end this journey, please?

John: I can't tell her like this.
I should not be the one.
Chris must come see his son.
Please, they don't say in the files there's a woman in love here. What
sustained her for miles Chris still knows nothing of.
