--- KIM ---
now Tam, my brave boy
our long wait has ended
smile Tam
for you have a father at last
--- Unknown ---
he has come
to take you home
all I dreamed for you
he'll do
you're still mine
but I can't go along
don't be sad
though I'm far away
I'll be watching you
--- Unknown ---
this is the hour
I swore I'd see
I alone can tell now
what the end will be
they think they'll decide your life
no, it will be me
--- Unknown ---
look at me one last time
don't forget what you see
one more kiss
and then say goodbye
--- CHRIS ---
Kim! Kim!
--- CHRIS ---
what have you done, Kim? Why?
--- KIM ---
the gods have guided you to your son
--- CHRIS ---
please don't die
--- KIM ---
hold me one more time
--- KIM ---
how in one night have we come... so far?
