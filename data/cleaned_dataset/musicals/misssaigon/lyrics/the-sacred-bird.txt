(In KIM'S room she has dressed TAM in his best clothes. She lights
candles at her family's shrine, then picks up the photo of her parents.)
--- KIM ---
from this picture I keep
you, my parents, look out
and your smiles show no scorn
I am happy today
for I know what to do
and my heart is not torn
spirits know when to fly
when it's time
there's no reason to mourn
for the great sacred bird is reborn
--- Unknown ---
from the ashes he'll rise
and upon his wide wings
I'll watch you from above
I will never be far
but my son, it's your turn
to know your father's love
I know now why I came to this earth
it's so you find your place
but for that I must leave your embrace
--- Unknown ---
you will be with your father now
give all your love to him when I am gone
take one last look at me
don't forget what you see
for now you must move on
--- Unknown ---
you will be who you want to be, you
can choose whatever heaven grants
as long as you can have your chance
I swear I'll give my life for you
no one will stop what I must do
my son, I'll give my life for you

CHRIS, JOHN and ELLEN into the little room where TAM is playing on
