------ Now That I've Seen Her ------
--- ELLEN ---
I don't want this
don't want to fight her
what did I do
I didn't come here
to meet a girl
who loves my husband
Chris has a son
he has to see him
but if he does
she'll be there with him
--- Unknown ---
I came here to help, but what do I do?
now, after this, what can I do?
--- Unknown ---
there are days
there are days when your life clouds over
and the world gets so dark
that all at once you can't tell night from day
--- Unknown ---
there are times
when your heart cries this isn't happening
but the truth is cold and real
and I know this storm won't go away
--- Unknown ---
it's her or me
now there's no way to hide
she is not some fling
from long ago
it's her or me
now I know why he lied
and I think it was better when I didn't know
--- Unknown ---
in her eyes, in her voice
in the heat that filled the air
part of him still lingers there
I know what pain her life today must be
but if it all comes down to her or me
I won't wait, I swear, I'll fight
--- Unknown ---
it's her or me
and it's me he must choose
I don't hate this girl even so
it's her or me
it's a fight I can't lose
I can't live wondering where his heart is
now I have to know
