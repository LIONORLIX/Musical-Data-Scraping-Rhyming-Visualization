------ Sun And Moon ------
--- KIM ---
You are sunlight and I moon
Joined by the gods of fortune
Midnight and high noon
Sharing the sky
We have been blessed, you and I
--- CHRIS ---
You are here like a mystery
I'm from a world that's so different
From all that you are
How in the light of one night
Did we come so far?
--- KIM ---
Outside day starts to dawn
--- CHRIS ---
Your moon still floats on high
--- KIM ---
The birds awake
--- CHRIS ---
The stars shine too
--- KIM ---
My hands still shake
--- CHRIS ---
I reach for you
--- BOTH ---
And we meet in the sky!
--- KIM ---
You are sunlight and I moon
Joined here
Bright'ning the sky
With the flame
Of love
--- BOTH ---
Made of
Sunlight
Moonlight
--- KIM ---
Tomorrow will be the full moon
I can bring friends to bless our room
With paper unicorns and perfume
If you want me to
--- CHRIS ---
