------ This Is The Hour ------
--- Unknown ---
(The ENGINEER, in a peasant clothes,
is brought back to the city from a re-education camp by THUY's soldiers.
THUY instructs him to find KIM in exchange for his freedom)
--- Unknown ---
(The ENGINEER tracks down KIM and leads THUY to her.
Once more, she rejects his love declaring that she's sworn herself
to CHRIS; the enraged THUY, now the people's commissar,
orders his soldiers to attack.
They wreck the room and beat up the ENGINEER)
--- ENGINEER ---
Are you waiting for them to kill me?
Did you not get what he said?
There's a big screw loose inside you
I will rip it out of your head
That's a mad dog on the rampage
If you think he'll change - save your
Breath
Just say Yes - I don't care if you love Him
Princess, life has it all over death!
--- KIM ---
I have a husband
Real as the sun in the sky
I cannot live with a lie
--- THUY ---
Do you see now who has power
Do you still think crazy things?
--- KIM ---
Chris will come to me like the phoenix
and he'll take me off on his wings
--- THUY ---
You're a traitor to your country
--- KIM ---
If I am, then let it be
--- KIM, THUY AND THE ENGINEER ---
I am talking of life or death now
I am talking of staying free
--- ENGINEER ---
So there it is now - it's time to move on
If you don't need me, I'd rather be gone
Two kids in love don't need strangers around
--- THUY ---
Just get out
--- ENGINEER ---
Right! I won't make a sound
--- Unknown ---
(grabs his sack and leaves)
--- THUY ---
And as for you
Come with me
--- KIM ---
NO
--- Unknown ---
There is a secret
That you don't know
There is a force here
I never show
You say it's treason
To keep my vow
Season after season
I survived somehow
If you want a reason
I will show you now
--- Unknown ---
(KIM pulls back the curtain and out runs a scared two year old boy.
KIM hugs him.)
--- Unknown ---
Look, Thuy, this is my son
He has kept me alive
Now you see why
I must tell you No
--- THUY ---
No one must ever see
This thing you're showing me
Your bastard fouls our name
--- KIM ---
My baby's not to blame
For what I've done
--- THUY ---
You must decide upon
Which side you're really on
You whored to make this kid
--- KIM ---
That isn't what I did
Don't touch my son
--- THUY ---
You must see how it is
When you're my wife
Having that child of his
Brands us for life
No alternative!
The child cannot live
--- Unknown ---
(THUY pulls a knife, threatening the boy)
--- KIM ---
No
You will not touch him
Don't touch my boy
He's what I live for
He's my only joy
--- KIM ---
You will not touch
him
--- THUY ---
He is my enemy
It's he turns you from me
--- KIM ---
Don't touch my boy
--- THUY ---
Erase him from your life
Even your memory
--- KIM ---
He's what I live for
--- THUY ---
He's one drop in a flood
Left here to taint our blood
--- KIM ---
He's my only joy
--- THUY ---
Our marriage bond was sworn
Forget that he was born
--- Unknown ---
(KIM pulls out a gun)
--- THUY ---
Of course you have a gun
And now you'll shoot your cousin'
And it's a U.S. gun
--- KIM ---
Don't touch my
little boy
--- Unknown ---
And do not test
--- Unknown ---
A gun that lost the war
my will
--- THUY ---
You're the corrupted one Go on and shoot - don't wait
To save your bastard son You must not hesitate
--- KIM ---
Im warning you,
for him
I'll kill
--- KIM ---
The earth moves where I stand
I feel the turning of a wheel
I feel nothing in my hand
Not even the feel of steel
You will not take my child...
--- THUY ---
You don't know how to kill
--- KIM ---
I have no other choice
What I must do I will
--- Unknown ---
(She shoots THUY - and at the same moment,
the street pageant continues in the street outside)
--- CROWD ---
This is the hour
This is our land
We found the power
In our brother's hand
And from a storm
Pierced with light
Fierce and white
The lightning came
A bright'ning flame
To end the night
--- Unknown ---
(A gigantic statue of Ho Chin Mihn is raised in the square outside)
--- Unknown ---
One man to heed us -
Each girl, each boy
One voice to lead us
In a song of joy
--- Unknown ---
This is the hour
This is our land
--- Unknown ---
(In the room, KIM stares and THUY's body)
--- Unknown ---
(KIM puts the gun, her family shrine and a few valuables in a sack,
