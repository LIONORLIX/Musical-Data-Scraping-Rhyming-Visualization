------ Kim's Nightmare ------
--- THUY ---
did you think I'd gone away
this is the face you saw that day
staring at you with open eyes
you're safe in the daylight
but in the dark I rise
--- Unknown ---
I'm the crime that you hid
for you want yo forget that you killed, but you did!
you will never be free
not as long as there's me
--- Unknown ---
did you think you would escape the judgement that was planned?
did you think you would escape the truth's avenging hand
just because you have escaped the bound'ries of your land
I'm here! I'm here! I'm never dead
I'm here! I am the guilt inside your head!
--- Unknown ---
You think your marine's not like other men?
he betrayed you once
and he will again
think about that night
where was he back then
--- CHRIS ---
I'm getting you out!
--- CAPTAIN SCHULTZ ---
sorry, sergeant, as things degenerate
all I'm giving her is her emigration papers
without the wait, sign here
--- CHRIS ---
that's not good enough. . .
--- CAPTAIN SCHULTZ ---
this will get her on board the carrier
you're declaring that you will marry her
when you get back to the states, sign here.
--- SOLDIERS ---
by order of the old man
the embassy will close according to plan
--- CAPTAIN SCHULTZ ---
I'll stretch a couple rules to issue her pass
that's it, you're ready. nice ass. who's next?
--- SOLDIERS ---
by order of the old man
we're processing the gooks as fast as we can
--- CAPTAIN SCHULTZ ---
I mean Vietnamese, hey don't get me wrong
can't leave these looks for the Cong - right?
--- CHRIS ---
Christ, I am due at the embassy
no time to lose
--- KIM ---
I don't want you to leave me today
--- CHRIS ---
well at least Uncle Sam bought our honeymoon cruise
--- KIM ---
if you're going I don't want to stay
--- CHRIS ---
look I'm leaving my gun
we got time
stay and pack
--- KIM ---
well I will do whatever you say
--- CHRIS ---
we'll get plenty of word when the VC attack
I want you in that bed waiting when I get back
--- DOC ---
sorry, sergeant, we must accelerate
state department says we evacuate
the word is, we must be out by dawn
--- CHRIS ---
but my girl is out there!
--- REEVES ---
sorry, sergeant, it's straight from Washington
no one leaves the grounds now, not anyone
as fast as we load the planes, we're gone
--- GIBBONS ---
okay! Keep quiet! don't shout!
the Ambassador won't leave till everyone's out
the choppers're on their way, there's room for you all
--- TROY ---
they're climbing over the wall!
get back!
--- MORE MARINES ---
get back! I tell you, don't shout
the Ambassador won't leave till everyone's out
--- NOLAN ---
the Ambassador just sent an order to freeze
--- HUSTON ---
that's it! No more Vietnamese! Get in!
--- KIM ---
I'm the wife of a soldier
please, let me through!
help me, who must I pay?

--- CHRIS ---

--- KIM ---

--- CHRIS ---

I can't get there
please be home
--- KIM ---

--- BOTH ---
please, get me through, I don't care how

--- KIM CHRIS ---

--- CHRIS ---
Oh Kim

--- FRYE ---

--- CHRIS ---

--- JOHN ---

--- ONE VIETNAMESE ---

--- ANOTHER ---
I have a letter, look!
--- ANOTHER ---

--- CROWD ---

don't leave us behind here!
--- A VIETNAMESE ---

--- ANOTHER ---

--- ANOTHER ---

--- CROWD ---

--- KIM ---
I must get in there, listen, anyone!
please tell my husband... look! I have his gun!
--- A VIETNAMESE ---
out of my way, if that's all that you've got!
--- CROWD ---
if I am here when they come, I'll be shot!
--- CHRIS ---
let me go, John, I can't leave her
why in the world should I be saved instead of her?
--- CROWD ---
they'll kill who they find here!
don't leave us behind here!
--- JOHN ---
it's not you, it's the war that's cruel
and if some dreams get smashed, perhaps it's best they were
--- Unknown ---
CROWD and KIM
there is no one to find here!
they have left us behind here!
--- JOHN ---
wake up, my friend, your mercy trip has failed
there's nothing you can do, that ship has sailed
she's not the only one we'll have betrayed
--- CROWD ---
get to the roof, or else we are betrayed!
--- KIM ---
oh, Chris
I still believe
the heart of you
is here with me
my heart, against all odds
holds still
--- KIM ---
you are sunlight and I moon
joined by the gods of fortune
midnight and high noon
that's what we are
how in one night have we come so far
outside, day starts to dawn
one long night time is gone
I feel you near
I cry no more
I know you're here
I reach your door
and our love is reborn!
bright'ning the sky
with the flame
of love
made of sunlight
moonlight
--- ENGINEER ---
Kim! Kim! Chris isat this hotel! Go quickly!
--- KIM ---
take care of Tam!
