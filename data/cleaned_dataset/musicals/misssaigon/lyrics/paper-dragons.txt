--- Engineer ---
Come on, come on, your recitation
Describe your reconciliation
I hope before his stimulation
He bought our little group vacation
--- Kim ---
In all his dreams he saw our baby
And he's teaching him to fly
Paper dragons in the sky
--- Engineer ---
Yes, papers, what's the situation?
We'll need our cards for immigration
No tricks, I've got my reputation
Don't want no phony complications
--- Kim ---
No, no
He's coming to us tonight
Pack your things
Get yourself arranged
While I change for my last performance
--- Engineer ---
Me, Chris and you
What a menage!
Bangkok can screw!
Bon voyage!
