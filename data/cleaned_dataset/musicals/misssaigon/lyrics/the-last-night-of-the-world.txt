------ The Last Night Of The World ------
--- Unknown ---
Chris
In a place that won't let us feel
In a life where nothing seems real
I have found you
I have found you
Kim
In a world that's moving to fast
In a world where nothing can last
I will hold you
I will hold you
Chris
Our lives will change when tomorrow comes
Kim
Tonight our hearts drown the distant drums
Chris
And we have music alright
tearing the night
Chris and Kim
A song
played on a solo saxophone
a crazy sound
a lonely sound
a cry that tells us love goes on and on
played on a solo saxophone
Its telling me to hold you tight
and dance like its the last night of the world
Chris
On the otherside of the the earth
there's a place where life still has worth
I will take you
Kim
I'll go with you
Chris
You wont believe all the things you'll see
I know cause you'll see them all with me
Chris and Kim
If we're together that's when
We'll here it again
A song
played on a solo saxophone
a crazy sound
a lonely sound
a cry that tells us love goes on and on
played on a solo saxophone
Its telling me to hold you tight
and dance like its the last night of the world
Kim
Dreams were all I ever knew
Chris
Dreams, you wont need when I'm through
Chris and Kim
Anywere
we may be
I will sing with you, a song...
So stay with me and hold me tight
