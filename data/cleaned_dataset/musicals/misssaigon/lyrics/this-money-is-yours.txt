------ This Money Is Yours ------
--- CHRIS ---
This money's yours
Please take it all
Hey, you want more?
--- KIM ---
No, no, I don't want anything
--- CHRIS ---
Hey, what's wrong with you?
--- KIM ---
I've not done this before
--- CHRIS ---
That can't be true!
--- KIM ---
Why would I lie?
--- CHRIS ---
All the girls lie!
They just want to get out of here
Maybe you're not like that
But I don't know who you are
--- KIM ---
Do you want one more tale of a Vietnam girl?
Want to know I was bound to a man I don't love?
Do you want to be told how my village was burned?
Want to hear how my family was blasted away?
How I ran from the rice field and saw them in flames?
How my parents were bodies whose faces were gone?
I have had my fill of pain
I will not look back again
I would rather die
--- CHRIS ---
Can I see you tonight?
--- KIM ---
Well, I'll be at the club
Selling beaucoup amour
--- CHRIS ---
No, you won't
How would you like...
--- KIM ---
How would I like...?
--- CHRIS ---
How would you like
Living with me?
It feels good like this
So that's how we should be
So would you like?
--- KIM ---
Yes, I would like!
--- CHRIS ---
Okay, it's set
No more to say
Screw the Engineer
You're the one good thing
