--- A Friday night in April 1975. ---
[Backstage at an after-hours club in Saigon.]
[Vietnamese bar-girls are getting into costumes.]
--- GIRLS ---
One of us will be Miss Saigon
--- ENGINEER ---
I spread the word - it's Miss Saigon
--- GIGI ---
Who's left to screw who hasn't gone
--- ENGINEER ---
Shut up! and get your hot pants on
--- GIGI ---
Each day more GI's disappear
--- ENGINEER ---
There's still some left and they'll all be here
--- ALL GIRLS ---
A girl can trust an engineer
--- THE ENGINEER brings in a new girl, KIM ---
--- ENGINEER ---
Surprise!
I found this new girl, get her dressed
From the country untouched
--- GIGI ---
Just give that virgin act a rest
--- ALL GIRLS ---
You are my first American
--- they laugh ---
--- ENGINEER ---
Allez! allez! allez!
Why does it take all day?
Get your asses on stage... I'm raising cash tonight
--- GIRLS ---
Tonight I will be Miss Saigon
--- ENGINEER ---
They say Saigon has weeks
I say it's time to pack
--- GIRLS ---
Tonight I will be Miss Saigon
--- ENGINEER ---
Each day these little buns of theirs are worth less and less
I need a visa fast, and I'm not looking back
--- the ENGINEER looks through the door into the club. ---
--- ENGINEER ---
Son of a bitch, they're here!
I can still engineer
It's like the old days, my little gamines
--- GIRLS ---
Oh sure!
--- ENGINEER ---
You know who's out here? a gang of marines!
--- GIRLS ---
They're here?
--- ENGINEER ---
We'll pick 'em clean that's what this contest's about
--- GIRLS ---
Yes, sir!
--- ENGINEER ---
One of these boys might be your ticket out
--- turns to KIM ---
--- Unknown ---
Why is she in that dress?
Ah! it's my new princess
Ah, yes!
A bride will give the guys a treat
Lower your eyelids and play sweet
Men pay the moon to get fresh meat
--- Unknown ---
Allez! allez! allez!
Get out and do your song!
Don't make the show too long
--- Unknown ---
Voila'! on stage all! welcome to...
