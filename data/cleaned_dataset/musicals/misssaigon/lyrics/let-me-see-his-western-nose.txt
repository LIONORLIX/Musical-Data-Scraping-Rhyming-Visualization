------ Let Me See His Western Nose ------
--- Unknown ---
(KIM bursts into the ENGINEER'S shack, carrying TAM)
--- KIM ---
Engineer!
Thuy is dead!
he was going to kill my baby and I shot
--- ENGINEER ---
you did what?
who is that?
you'll be followed! Get him out of here! Good-bye!
--- KIM ---
we must leave!
Tam and I!
we must set off for America tonight
--- ENGINEER ---
oh right!
just like that!
tell me how, and while you're at it, tell me why
--- KIM ---
I hear the voice of my soldier
telling me to bring... his son
--- ENGINEER ---
you're telling me this half-breed brat
is born the son of a marine?
--- Unknown ---
let me see his western nose
this bastard is... the most beautiful sight I've ever seen!
a passport in my hand
my new life can begin
your brat's American
so they must let us in!
in!
the playground of mankind!
the movie in my mind!
--- Unknown ---
I'm your dear brother from now on
and all our family is gone
boy, kiss your brand-new uncle Tran
this kid is okay
he is our entree
to the U.S.A.
--- Unknown ---
with these two little diamonds to bait my hooks
I'll book us on a cruise boat-people deluxe
don't worry 'bout the sharks out in the Mekong bay
the pirates taking us are more scary any day
--- Unknown ---
you just stay here and hide
don't show your face outside
take care of our little dear
I will go engineer
--- Unknown ---
(He runs out.)
--- Unknown ---
(In the street)
--- ENGINEER ---
if you want to die in bed
don't care too much for country
hit the open sea instead
and float there like a cork
uncle ho, ho ho ho ho!
