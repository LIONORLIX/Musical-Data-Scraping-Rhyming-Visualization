------ Mr. Right ------

Give me a man
Who can rise
To the moment at hand
I mean my kind of man
just need to look
in his eyes
and you know where he'll stand
--- Unknown ---
No sweet forevers,
No ties
Nothing promised or planned
No,no,no,
no, gold band!
Just want a guy
who supplies what these moments demand
--- Unknown ---
Mister right

Handsome brute,
Heart's delight!

Connoisseurs of carnal pleasure,
Call me skilled beyond all measure,
Like the casanova of their dreams
Veritable Virtuoso, not a move I make is So-So,
Just what you are seeking, so it seems
