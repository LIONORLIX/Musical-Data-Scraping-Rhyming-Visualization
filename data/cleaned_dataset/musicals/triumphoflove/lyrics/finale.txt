This is love,
Now we can this say is it.
Love, now we can
Yes, say this it is love a sit should this be.
Is love as it should be.
Knowing I will love you till I die,
And knowing you love me.
Issue in question, a joy triumphant,
Difficult to suppress.
Simple suggestion, enjoy the moment,
Agonizeless.
Logical premise from the start,
Marrying both the mind and heart,
Issue in question,
Issue in question,
No question,
