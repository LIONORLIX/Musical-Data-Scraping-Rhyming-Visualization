------ Henchmen Are Forgotten ------

You'd think we'd get applause at least
A thank you note a gift
Awe'd be lost without you speech
Araise, you get my drift
But let me set you straight, old pal,
The way the world is run
Henchmen are forgotten
Once the dirty work is done.
Henchmen are forgotten
Henchmen are forgotten and it's not a lot of fun.
Me, I say it's rotten
Like day old peas-au-gratin.
But henchmen are forgotten once the dirty work is done.
The man who is devoted to the family he serves,
Who puts them first his whole life through,
Gets just what he deserves.
But let me say 'twas ever thus,
And ever will be, son.
Henchmen are forgotten once the dirty work is done.
Henchmen are forgotten
Henchmen are forgotten
Henchmen are forgotten
I mean each and everyeryone.
Yes, I know you're shattered,
But no, you never mattered.
True, you gave your all for,
But now there is no call for.
No one ever better,
I'll write aglowing letter.
Sure, you stood behind me.
Uhh... What's your name, remind me.
Like we said, said,
It's rotten,
The way they keep us trottin',
Then Whammo!
Out of nowhere,
Like your av'rage' hit and run.
Henchmen are forgotten
Henchmen are forgotten
Henchmen are forgotten
