------ The Bond That Can't Be Broken ------
--- Princess Leonide, Agis ---
--- Unknown ---
Swear!
You will do anything I ask.
Swear! For it may be no simple task.
You'll seek him out this very day,
And beg Hermocrates to let me stay.
Swear! You will not hesitate to plead.
Swear! You can, you will, you must succeed.
Swear! I will not stint in my campaign,
Nor rest till he agrees you may remain.
When friends do their affection prove,
As brother would for broother,
All earthly doubt they thus remove
And cleave to one another
Of all the wealth that they possess,
Of all the words they've spoken,
There is no greater bond, I vow,
No greater gift the gods endow,
Than this the bond between them now,
The bond that can't be broken.
The bond that can't be broken.
Swear! That you are not afraid to kill.
Swear! Say Yes, I promise, yes I will
Swear...You will not heed her fearful cries,
But see that she, the princess dies!
Swear! The sight of blood won't make you flinch.
Swear! That you will never give an inch.
When she clutches at your sleeve,
And looks you in the eye,
Then whimpers with the pain and whispers
Why? Why? I... I... Swear! I swear.
When friends do their affection prove,
As brother would for broother,
All earthly doubt they thus remove
And cleave to one another
Of all the wealth that they possess,
Of all the words they've spoken,
There is no greater bond, I vow,
No greater gift the gods endow,
Than this the bond between them now,
The bond that can't be broken.
