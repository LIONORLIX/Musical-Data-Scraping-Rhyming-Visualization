------ Teach Me Not to Love You ------

--- Unknown ---
So much for "Plan B"
Arousing success it's not.
You're angry with me.
I guess you might say alot.
I thought I was doing so well.
I'm so perceptive
Can't you tell?
I wish I were not so aware
Of how much or how deeply I care.
Teach me not to love you,
Help me close that hopeless door.
Show me how it's done.
How I came to love
Doesn't matter anymore.
Back to chapter one.
Turn my heart to ice so I don't feel it.
If not, then tell me now
How else to heal it.
Tell me to leave you
And I'll turn around and walk away,
Even take one fleeting, final bow.
But loving you is all I know.
How am I supposed to go,
If I can't deflect the blow somehow?
Oh, how well you taught me ev'ry word of love you disavow.
Teach me not to love you now.
Turn my heart to ice, so I won't feel it.
If not then tell me now, else to heal it.
Tell me how to leave you,
And I'll turn around and walk away,
Walk instead of dying by degrees.
But loving you is all I know.
Loving you is all I now know.
Am I supposed to go?
How am I to let you one go?
Of love's unlucky
Love's refugees.
If I cannot have you, you,
I don't want to have the memories
Teach me not to love you
Teach me how to love you,
