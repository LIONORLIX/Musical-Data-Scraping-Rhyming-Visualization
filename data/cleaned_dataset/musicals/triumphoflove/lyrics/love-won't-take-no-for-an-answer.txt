------ Love Won't Take No for an Answer ------
--- Hermocrates, Hesione, Agis ---
--- Unknown ---
Who would have thought at my age,
Who would have thought at all,
I would be sitting here, heart in hand,
Watching my fortress fall.
I, who was taught to reason,
Stripped of the wherewithal!
Not that I'meager to understand
How my intelligence lost command
Not for a moment was this thing planned,
Love won't take no for an answer.
Something went wrong
I promise.
Somehow my fate was sealed.
I who was always remote before,
Suddenly stood revealed.
I, who had strong convictions,
I, who would never yield,
Sat here and silently lost the war,
Practically ushered her through the door,
Now she's all
I think about anymore.
Love won't take no for an answer.
Ahh how sweet the ache of it, delirium
Divine! It's love's perfume, partake of it,
Cries this old heart of mine!
Who really cares what happened,
Suddenly I'm alive.
Given to singing a bit too loud,
Shedding my Aristotelian shroud,
Scrapping the various vows I vowed,
And quivering head to toe.
Wanting it so,
Needing it so,
