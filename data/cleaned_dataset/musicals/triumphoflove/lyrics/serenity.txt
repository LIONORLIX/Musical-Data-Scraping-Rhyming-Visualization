--- Unknown ---
The summer that I was seventeen,
My heart was an open door.
It welcomed all comers, sight unseen
And trusted the smiles they wore.
They came in a whirl of want and words,
Those feckless and false young men.
They tore at my heart like hungry birds
And never came back again.
Serenity, Serenity,
I never knew any then.
--- Unknown ---
I longed for a place where reason rules
And appetites are denied,
Where blood that is heated quickly cools
Away from the world outside.
Serenity, Serenity,
A haven where I could hide.
--- Unknown ---
I found it at last
Amid the manuscripts here.
So thankfully tranquil,
Time drifted past my safe,
Sweet harbor of harmony,
So enchantingly austere.
--- Unknown ---
And now without warning, you appear
So passionate, young and fair,
Assaulting the thing I hold most dear,
With a toss of your sunlit hair.
Your hint of a smile, your almost arrogant grace
So carelessly carried, cannot beguile the cruel and Terrible tyranny and that oh so heartless face.
--- Unknown ---
And all that I once had yearned to be,
Whatever I did not dare is everything I can sense and see in your at this moment there.
And suddenly, serenity,
