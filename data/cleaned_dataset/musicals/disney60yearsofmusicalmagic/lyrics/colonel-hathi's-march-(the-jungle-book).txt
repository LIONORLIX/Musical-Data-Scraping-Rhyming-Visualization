------ Colonel Hathi's March (The Jungle Book) ------
--- Unknown ---
Hup two three four
Keep it up two three four
Hup two three four
Keep it up two three four
Company sound off!
--- Unknown ---
Ho, the aim of our patrol
Is a question rather droll
For to march and drill
Over field and hill
Is a military goal!
Is a military goal!
--- Unknown ---
Hup two three four
Dress it up two three four
Hup two three four
Dress it up two three four
--- Unknown ---
By the ranks or single file
Over every jungle mile
Oh we stamp and crush
Through the underbrush
In a military style!
In a military style!
--- Unknown ---
Hup two three four
