------ He's a Tramp (Lady and the Tramp) ------
--- Unknown ---
He's a tramp
But they love him
Breaks a new heart
Ev'ry day
--- Unknown ---
He's a tramp
They adore him
And I only hope
He'll stay that way
--- Unknown ---
He's a tramp
He's a scoundrel
He's a rounder
He's a cad
--- Unknown ---
He's a tramp
But I love him
Yes, even I
Have got it pretty bad
--- Unknown ---
You can never tell
When he'll show up
He gives you
Plenty of trouble
I
guess he's just a
No 'count pup
But I wish that he
Were double
--- Unknown ---
He's a tramp
He's a rover
And there's nothing
More to say
--- Unknown ---
If he's a tramp
He's a good one
And I wish that I
Could travel his way(x3)
