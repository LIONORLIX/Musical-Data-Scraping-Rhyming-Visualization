------ Feed the Birds (Mary Poppins) ------
--- Unknown ---
Early each day to the steps of Saint Paul's
The little old bird woman comes.
In her own special way to the people she calls,
Come, buy my bags full of crumbs.
--- Unknown ---
Come feed the little birds, show them you care
And you'll be glad if you do.
Their young ones are hungry,
Their nests are so bare;
All it takes is tuppence from you.
--- Unknown ---
Feed the birds, tuppence a bag,
Tuppence, tuppence, tuppence a bag.
Feed the birds, that's what she cries,
While overhead, her birds fill the skies.
--- Unknown ---
All around the cathedral the saints and apostles
Look down as she sells her wares.
Although you can't see it, you know they are smiling
Each time someone shows that he cares.
--- Unknown ---
Though her words are simple and few,
Listen, listen, she's calling to you:
Feed the birds, tuppence a bag,
