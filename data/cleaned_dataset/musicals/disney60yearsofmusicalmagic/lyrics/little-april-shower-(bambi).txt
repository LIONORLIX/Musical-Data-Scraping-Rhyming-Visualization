------ Little April Shower (Bambi) ------
--- Unknown ---
Drip, drip, drop
Little April shower
Beating a tune
As you fall all around
--- Unknown ---
Drip, drip, drop
Little April shower
What can compare
To your beautiful sound
--- Unknown ---
Drip, drip, drop
When the sky is cloudy
Your pretty music
Can brighten the day
--- Unknown ---
Drip, drip, drop
When the sun says howdy
You say goodbye right away
--- Unknown ---
Drip, drip drop
Little April shower
Beating a tune
Ev'rywhere that you fall
--- Unknown ---
Drip, drip drop
Little April shower
I'm getting wet
And I don't care at all
--- Unknown ---
Drip, drop, drip, drop
I'll never be afraid
Of a good little
Gay little
