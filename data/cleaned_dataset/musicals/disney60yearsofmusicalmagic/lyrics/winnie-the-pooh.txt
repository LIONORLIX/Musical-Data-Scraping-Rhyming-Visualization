------ Winnie the Pooh ------
--- Unknown ---
Deep in the Hundred Acre Woods,
Where Christopher Robin plays.
You'll find the enchanted neighborhood,
of Christopher's childhood days.
--- Unknown ---
A donkey named Eeyore is his friend.
And Kanga and Little Roo.
There's Rabbit and Piglet.
And there's Owl.
But most of all Winnie the Pooh!
--- Unknown ---
Winnie the Pooh, Winnie the Pooh,
A tubby, little cubby all stuffed with fluff.
He's Winnie the Pooh, Winnie the Pooh,
A willy, really, silly old bear.
