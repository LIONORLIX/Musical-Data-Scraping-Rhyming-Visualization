------ Are We Dancing (The Happiest Millionaire) ------
--- Unknown ---
Are we dancing
are we really here
is this feeling something real
or will it disappear
--- Unknown ---
are we dancing
does the music soar
was this lovely song I hear
ever heard before
--- Unknown ---
Are you're eyes confessing things
I alone can see
or is my imagination
flying away with me
--- Unknown ---
Are we dancing
say we really are
than I'll know that I reached into the sky
I reached into the sky and touched a star
--- Unknown ---
Is this feeling something real
or will it disappear
--- Unknown ---
was this lovely song I hear
ever heard before

Are you're eyes confessing things
I alone can see
or is my imagination
flying away with me
--- Unknown ---
Are we dancing
say we really are
then I'll know that I reached into the sky
