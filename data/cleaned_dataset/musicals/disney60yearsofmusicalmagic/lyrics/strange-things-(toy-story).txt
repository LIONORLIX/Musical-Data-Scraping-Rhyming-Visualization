------ Strange Things (Toy Story) ------
--- Unknown ---
I was on top of the world
it was right in my pocket
I was living the life
things were just the way they should be
When from out of the sky like a bomb comes some little punk in a rocket
now all of a sudden some strange things are happening to me
--- Unknown ---
I had friends,
I had lots of friends
Now all my friends are gone
And I'm doing the best I can to carry on
--- Unknown ---
I had power (power)
I was respected (respect)
But not any more
And I've lost the love to the one whom I adored
--- Unknown ---
Let me tell you about the strange things are happening to me
Strange things
Strange things are happening to me...
Ain't no doubt about it
--- Unknown ---
You got someone you think you know well
It turns out a stranger
The minute you turn your back
You're in it all by yourself
--- Unknown ---
They laugh at your jokes,
You think you're doing well
But you're in danger, boy
You end up alone, forgotten, way up on the shelf
--- Unknown ---
Strange things are happening to me
Strange things
Strange things are happening to me
Ain't no doubt about it
--- Unknown ---
Strange things are happening to me
Strange things
Strange things are happening to me
--- Unknown ---
