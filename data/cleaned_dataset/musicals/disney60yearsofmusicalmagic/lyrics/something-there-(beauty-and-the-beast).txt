------ Something There (Beauty And the Beast) ------
--- Belle: ---
There's something sweet
And almost kind
But he was mean and he was coarse and unrefined
And now he's dear
And so I'm sure
I wonder why I didn't see it there before
--- Beast: ---
She glanced this way
I thought I saw
And when we touched she didn't shudder at my paw
No it can't be
I'll just ignore
But then she's never looked at me that way before
--- Belle: ---
New and a bit alarming
Who'd have ever thought that this could be?
True that he's no Prince Charming
But there's something in him that I simply didn't see
--- Lumiere: ---
Well, who'd have thought?
--- Mrs Potts: ---
Well, bless my soul
--- Cogsworth: ---
Well, who'd have known?
--- Mrs Potts: ---
Well, who indeed?
--- Lumiere: ---
And who'd have guessed they'd come together on their own?
--- Mrs Potts: ---
It's so peculiar. Wait and see
--- Lumiere and Cogsworth: ---
We'll wait and see
--- All three: ---
A few days more
There may be something there that wasn't there before
--- Cogsworth: ---
You know, perhaps there's something there that wasn't there before
--- Mrs Potts: ---
