------ A Guy Like You (The Hunchback of Norte Dame) ------
--- Hugo ---
Paris, the city of lovers
Is glowing this evening
True, that's because it's on fire
But still, there's l'amour
Somewhere out there in the night
Her Heart is also alight
And I know the guy she just might
Be burning for
--- Unknown ---
A guy like you
She's never known, kid
A guy like you
A girl does not meet ev'ry day
You've got a look
That's all your own, kid
Could there be two?
--- Victor and Laverne ---
Like you?
--- All Three ---
No way!
--- Hugo ---
Those other guys
That she could dangle
All look the same
From ev'ry boring point of view
You're a surprise
From ev'ry angle
Mon Dieu above
She's gotta love
A guy like you
--- Victor ---
A guy like you
Gets extra credit
Because it's true
You've got a certain some thing more
--- Hugo ---
You're aces, kid
--- Laverne ---
You see that face
You don't forget it
--- Victor and Laverne ---
Want something new?
--- Hugo ---
That's you
--- All Three ---
For sure!
--- Laverne ---
We all have gaped
At some Adonis
--- Victor ---
But then we crave a meal
More nourishing to chew
--- Hugo ---
And since you've shaped
Like a croissant is
--- All Three ---
No question of
She's gotta love
A guy like you!
--- Laverne ---
Call me a hopeless romatic
But Quasi, I feel it
--- Victor ---
She wants you so
Any moment she'll walk through that door
--- All Three ---
For
--- Hugo ---
A guy so swell
--- Victor and Laverne ---
A guy like you
--- Hugo ---
With all you bring her
--- Victor and Laverne ---
I tell you Quasi
--- Hugo ---
A fool could tell
--- Victor and Laverne ---
There never was
--- Hugo ---
It's why she fell
--- Victor and Laverne ---
Another, was he?
--- Hugo ---
For you-know-who
--- Victor and Laverne ---
From king to serf
To the bourgeoisie
--- Hugo ---
You ring the bell
--- Victor and Laverne ---
They're all a second-stringer
--- All Three ---
You're the bell ringer!
When she wants oo-la-la
Then she wants you la-la
She will discover, guy
You're one heckuva guy
Who wouldn't love a guy
Like you?
--- Hugo ---
You got a lot
The rest have not
So she's gotta love
A guy like you!
