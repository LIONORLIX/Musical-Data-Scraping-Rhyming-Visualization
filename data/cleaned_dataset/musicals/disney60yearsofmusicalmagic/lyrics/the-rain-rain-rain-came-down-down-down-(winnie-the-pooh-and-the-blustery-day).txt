------ The Rain Rain Rain Came Down Down Down (Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day) ------
--- Unknown ---
The rain rain rain came down down down
In rushing, rising riv'lets,
'Til the river crept out of it's bed
And crept right into Piglet's!
Poor Piglet, he was frightened,
With quite a rightful fright.
And so, in desperation
A message he did write.
He placed it in a bottle
And it floated out of sight.
--- Unknown ---
And the rain rain rain came down down down
So Piglet started bailing.
He was unaware, atop his chair,
While bailing he was sailing!
--- Unknown ---
And the rain rain rain came down down down
And the flood rose up up upper.
Pooh, too, was caught and so he thought,
I must rescue my supper!
Ten honey pots he rescued,
Enough to see him through,
But as he sopped up his supper,
The river sopped up Pooh!
And the water twirled and tossed him
In a honey pot canoe!
The rain rain rain came down down down...
