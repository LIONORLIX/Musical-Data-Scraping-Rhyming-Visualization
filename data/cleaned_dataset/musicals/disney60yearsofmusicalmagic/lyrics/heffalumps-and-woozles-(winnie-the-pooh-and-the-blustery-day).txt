------ Heffalumps and Woozles (Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day) ------
--- Unknown ---
They're black, they're brown
They're up, they're down
They're in, they're out
They're all about
They're far, they're near
They're gone, they're here
They're quick and slick
They're insincere
--- Unknown ---
Beware, beware
Be a very wary bear
--- Unknown ---
A heffalump or woozle
Is very confuzle
A heffalump or woozle's very sly, sly, sly, sly
They come in ones and twoozles
But if they so choozles
Before your eyes you'll see them multiply, ply, ply, ply
--- Unknown ---
They're extraordinary, so better bewary
Because they come in every shape and size, size, size, size
If honey's what you covet
You'll find that they love it
Because they'll guzzle up the thing you prize!
