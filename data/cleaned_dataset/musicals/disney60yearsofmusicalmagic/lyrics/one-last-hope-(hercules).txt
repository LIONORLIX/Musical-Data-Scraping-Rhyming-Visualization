------ One Last Hope (Hercules) ------
--- Unknown ---
So, ya wanna be a hero, kid?
Well, whoop-de-do!
I have been around the block before
With blockheads just like you
--- Unknown ---
Each and ev'ryone a disappointment
Pain for which there ain't no ointment
So much for excuses
Though a kid of Zeus is
Asking me to jump into the fray
My answer is two words -
O.K.
You win
Oh gods
Oy vay!
--- Unknown ---
I'd given up hope that someone would come along
A fellow who'd ring the bell for once
Not the gong
The kind who wins trophies
Won't settle for low fees
At least semi-pro fees
But no - I get the greenhorn
--- Unknown ---
I've been out to pasture pal, my ambition gone
Content to spend lazy days and to graze my lawn
But you need an advisor
A satyr, but wiser
A good merchandiser
And oohh!
There goes my ulcer!
--- Unknown ---
I'm down to one last hope
And I hope it's you
Though, kid, you're not exactly
A dream come true
I've trained enough turkeys
Who never came through
You're my one last hope
So you'll have to do
--- Unknown ---
Demigods have faced the odds
And ended up a mockery
Don't believe the stories
That you read on all the crockery
--- Unknown ---
To be a true hero, kid, is a dying art
Like painting a masterpiece, it's a work of heart
It takes more than sinew
Comes down to what's in you
You have to continue to grow
Now that's more like it!
--- Unknown ---
I'm down to one last shoot
And my last high note
Before that blasted Underworld
Gets my goat
My dreams are on you, kid
Go make 'em come true
Climb that uphil slope
Keep pushing that envelope
You're my one last hope
