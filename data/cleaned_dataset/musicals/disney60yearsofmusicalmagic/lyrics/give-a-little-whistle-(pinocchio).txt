------ Give a Little Whistle (Pinocchio) ------
--- Unknown ---
When you get in trouble and you don't know right from wrong
Give a little whistle!  Give a little whistle!
When you meet temptation and the urge is very strong
Give a little whistle!  Give a little whistle!
--- Unknown ---
Not just a little squeak, pucker up and blow
And if your whistle's weak, yell, Jiminy Cricket!
Right!
--- Unknown ---
Take the straight and narrow path
And if you start to slide
Give a little whistle!  Give a little whistle!
