------ Looking for Romance / I Bring You A Song (Bambi) ------
--- Unknown ---
I bring you a song
And I sing as I go
For I want you to know
That I'm looking for romance
--- Unknown ---
I bring you song
In the hope that you'll see
When you're looking at me
That I'm looking for love
--- Unknown ---
I'm seeking that glow
Only found when you're young and it's May
Only found on that wonderful day
When all longing is through
--- Unknown ---
I'm seeking that glow
Only found when a thrill is complete
Only found when two hearts gently beat
To the strains of a waltz that's both tender and new
--- Unknown ---
I bring you a song
For I'm seeking romance
--- Unknown ---
You're by my side
There's a moon up above
It shines with a light that's so mellow and bright
It's easy to see
That tonight we shall fall in love
--- Unknown ---
I bring you a song
For I'm seeking romance
