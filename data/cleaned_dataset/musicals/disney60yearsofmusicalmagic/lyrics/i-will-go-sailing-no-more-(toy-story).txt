------ I Will Go Sailing No More (Toy Story) ------
--- Unknown ---
Out among the stars I sail
Way beyond the moon
In my silver ship I sail
The dream that ended too soon
But now I know
Exactly who
I am, what I'm here for
And I will go sailing no more
--- Unknown ---
All the things I thought I knew
All the brave things I've done
Vanished like a snowflake
With the rising of the sun
Nevermore
To sail my ship
Where no man has gone before
And I will go sailing no more
--- Unknown ---
But no
It can't be true
I could fly if I wanted to
Like a bird in the sky
If I believe I can fly
Boy I'll fly
