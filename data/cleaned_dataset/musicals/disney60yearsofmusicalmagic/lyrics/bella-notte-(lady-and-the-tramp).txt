------ Bella Notte (Lady and the Tramp) ------
--- Unknown ---
Oh this is the night,
it's a beautiful night
And we call it bella notte.
--- Unknown ---
Look at the skies,
they have stars in their eyes
On this lovely bella notte.
--- Unknown ---
Side by side with your loved one,
You'll find enchantment here.
The night will weave its magic spell,
When the one you love is near!
--- Unknown ---
Oh this is the night,
and the heavens are right!
