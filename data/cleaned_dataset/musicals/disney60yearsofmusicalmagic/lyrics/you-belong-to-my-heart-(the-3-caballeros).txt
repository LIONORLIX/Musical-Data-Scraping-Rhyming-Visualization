------ You Belong to My Heart (The 3 Caballeros) ------
--- Unknown ---
You belong to my heart
Now and forever
And our love had its start
Not long ago
--- Unknown ---
We were gathering stars while a million guitars played our love song
When I said, I love you, every beat of my heart said it, too
--- Unknown ---
'Twas a moment like this
Do you remember?
And your eyes threw a kiss
When they met mine
--- Unknown ---
Now, we own all the stars, and a million guitars are still playing
Darling, you are the song, and you'll always belong to my heart
