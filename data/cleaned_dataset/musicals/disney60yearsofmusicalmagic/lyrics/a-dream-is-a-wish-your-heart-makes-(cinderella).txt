------ A Dream is a Wish Your Heart Makes (Cinderella) ------
--- Unknown ---
A dream is a wish your heart makes
When you're fast asleep
In dreams you lose your heartaches
Whatever you wish for, you keep
--- Unknown ---
Have faith in your dreams and someday
Your rainbow will come smiling through
No matter how your heart is grieving
If you keep on believing
the dream that you wish will come true

The dreams that i wish will come true
No matter how your heart is grieving
If you keep on believing
the dream that you wish will come true
