Steady as the beating drum
Singing to the cedar flute
Seasons go and seasons come
Bring the corn and bear the fruit
--- Unknown ---
By the waters sweet and clean
Where the mighty sturgeon lives
Plant the squash and reap the bean
All the earth our mother gives
--- Unknown ---
O Great Spirit, hear our song
Help us keep the ancient ways
Keep the sacred fire strong
Walk in balance all our days
--- Unknown ---
Seasons go and seasons come
Steady as the beating drum
Plum to seed to bud to plum
Steady as the beating drum
--- Unknown ---
Hega hega ya-hi-ye-hega
