------ Stop, Look, and Listen/I'm No Fool (Mickey Mouse Club) ------

Stop, look and listen
And always use your head
Look at the signal
Is it green or red
--- Unknown ---
First, you stop, then you look
Then you listen hard
You can make just any street
As safe as your backyard
--- Unknown ---
Stop, look and listen
Your eyes will tell your feet
When you can safely
Walk across the street
--- Unknown ---
First, you stop, then you look
Then you listen hard
You can make just any street
As safe as your backyard
--- Unknown ---
Stop, look and listen!

(spoken) "That's very good advice, huh, and I always follow it because..."
--- Unknown ---
I'm no fool! No sirree!
I want to live to be seventy-three
I play safe for you and me 'cause
I'm no fool!
--- Unknown ---
Any fool play's in the street
As though it were a field
A bumper throws him for a loss
Against the car's windshield
--- Unknown ---
Oh, I'm no fool! No sirree!
I want to live to be eighty-three
I play safe for you and me 'cause
I'm no fool!
--- Unknown ---
Any fool gets out of cars
The wrong side only once
And if he lives to tell the tale
He's crowned a stupid dunce
--- Unknown ---
Oh, I'm no fool! No sirree!
I want to live to be ninety-three
I play safe for you and me 'cause
I'm no fool!
--- Unknown ---
Stop, look and listen
And always use your head

As safe as your backyard
