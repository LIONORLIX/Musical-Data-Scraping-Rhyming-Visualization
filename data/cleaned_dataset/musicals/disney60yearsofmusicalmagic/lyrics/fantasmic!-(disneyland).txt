See it... in your mind, and you will find, in your imagination...
mysteries and magic, visions fantastic,
leading to strange and wondrous dreams.
Dreams, of make believe, but will they all come true...
--- CHORUS ---
In your imagination...
in your imagination...
deep in your mind it's magic you'll find,
when out of the night dark forces ignite,
to blind you with frightening schemes;
you use your might to fight in the light,
creating a night of wondrous dreams...
