------ What's This? (The Nightmare Before Christmas) ------
--- Unknown ---
What's this? What's this?
There's color everywhere
What's this?
There's white things in the air
What's this?
I can't believe my eyes
I must be dreaming
Wake up, jack, this isn't fair
What's this?
--- Unknown ---
What's this? What's this?
There's something very wrong
What's this?
There are people singing songs
--- Unknown ---
What's this?
The streets are lined with
Little creatures laughing
Everybody seems so happy
Have I possibly gone daffy?
What is this?
What's this?
--- Unknown ---
There are children throwing snowballs here
instead of throwing heads
They're busy building toys
And absolutely no one's dead
--- Unknown ---
There's frost on every window
Oh, I can't believe my eyes
And in my bones I feel the warmth
That's coming from inside
--- Unknown ---
Oh, look
What's this?
They're hanging mistletoe, they kiss
Why that looks so unique, inspired
They're gathering around to hear a story
Roasting chestnuts on a fire
What's this?
What's this?
--- Unknown ---
In here they've got a little tree, how queer
And who would ever think
And why?
--- Unknown ---
They're covering it with tiny little things
They've got electric lights on strings
And there's a smile on everyone
So, now, correct me if I'm wrong
This looks like fun
This looks like fun
Oh, could it be I got my wish?
What's this?
--- Unknown ---
Oh my, what now?
The children are asleep
But look, there's nothing underneath
No ghouls, no witches here to scream and scare them
Or ensnare them, only little cozy things
Secure inside their dreamland
What's this?
--- Unknown ---
The monsters are all missing
And the nightmares can't be found
And in their place there seems to be
Good feeling all around
--- Unknown ---
Instead of screams, I swear
I can hear music in the air
The smell of cakes and pies
Is absolutely everywhere
--- Unknown ---
The sights, the sounds
They're everywhere and all around
I've never felt so good before
This empty place inside of me is filling up
I simply cannot get enough
--- Unknown ---
I want it, oh, I want it
Oh, I want it for my own
I've got to know
I've got to know
What is this place that I have found?
What is this?
