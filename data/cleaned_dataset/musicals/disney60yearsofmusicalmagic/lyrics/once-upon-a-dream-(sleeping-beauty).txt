------ Once Upon a Dream (Sleeping Beauty) ------
--- Unknown ---
I know you
I walked with you once upon a dream
I know you
That gleam in your eyes seems so familiar to me
And I know its true
That visions are seldom what they seem
But if I know you
I know what you'll do
You'll love me at once
The way you did once
Upon a dream
--- Unknown ---
(vocalizing)
--- Unknown ---
But if I know you
I know what you'll do
You'll love me at once
Princess Rose and Prince
The way you did once
Upon a dream

Prince
I know you
I walked with you once upon a dream
I know you
The gleam in your eyes seems so familiar to me

chorus
And I know its true
That visions are seldom what they seem
But if I know you
I know what you'll do
You'll love me at once
The way I did once
