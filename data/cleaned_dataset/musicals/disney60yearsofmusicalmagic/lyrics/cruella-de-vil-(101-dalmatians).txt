Cruella De Vil
Cruella De Vil
If she doesn't scare you
No evil thing will
To see her is to take a sudden chill
Cruella, Cruella De Vil
--- Unknown ---
The curl of her lips, the ice in her stare
All innocent children had better beware
She's like a spider waiting for the kill
Look out for Cruella De Vil
--- Unknown ---
Cruella, Cruella De Vil
If she doesn't scare you, no evil thing will
Cruella, Cruella De Vil
To see her is to take a sudden chill
Cruella De Vil

This vampire bat, this inhuman beast
She ought to be locked up and never released
The world was such a wholesome place until
Cruella, Cruella De Vil
--- Unknown ---
Cruella, Cruella De Vil
If she doesn't scare you, no evil thing will
Cruella, Cruella De Vil
To see her is to take a sudden chill
Cruella De Vil

At first you think Cruella is the devil
But after time has worn away the shock
You've come to realize
You've seen her kind of eyes
Watching you from underneath a rock
--- Unknown ---
Cruella, Cruella De Vil
If she doesn't scare you no evil thing will
Cruella, Cruella De Vil
To see her is to take a sudden chill
Cruella, Cruella De Vil
If she doesn't scare you no evil thing will
Cruella, Cruella De Vil
To see her is to take a sudden chill
Cruella De Vil
