Why cry about bad weather? Enjoy it!
Each moment is a treasure, enjoy it!
We are travelers on life’s highway, enjoy the trip
Each lovely twist and byway is bum and dip
--- Unknown ---
If there’s a complication, enjoy it!
You’ve got imagination, employ it!
And you’ll see roses in the snow,
Joie de vivre will make them grow,
Voila, that’s life, enjoy it!

Ta-e-da-di-da-ya-da, Enjoy it!
Ta-e-da-di-da-ye-da, Enjoy it!

Hurricane comes your way, enjoy the breeze
Your stranded in the jungle, enjoy the trees.

If there’s a complication, enjoy it!
You’ve got imagination, employ it!
This world’s a cornucopia,
Why it could be, Utopia?
Voila, that’s right, enjoy it!
