------ I'm Wishing/One Song (Snow White & the 7 Dwarfs) ------
--- Unknown ---
Want to hear a secret?
Promise to never tell?
We are standing by a wishing well.
Make a wish into the well
That's all you have to do
And when you hear it echoing
You're wish will soon come true.
I'm wishing (I'm wishing)
For the one I love
To find me (To find me)
Today (Today)
I'm wishing (I'm wishing)
And I'm dreaming of
The nice things (The nice things)
He'll say.
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah (repeat)

One Song
I have but one song
One song
Only for you
One heart
Tenderly beating
Ever entreating
Constant and true
One love
That has possessed me
One love
Thrilling me through
One song
My heart keeps singing
Of one love
Only for you
