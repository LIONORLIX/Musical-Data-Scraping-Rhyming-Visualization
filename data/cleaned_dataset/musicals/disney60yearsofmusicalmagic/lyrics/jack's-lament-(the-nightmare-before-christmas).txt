------ Jack's Lament (The Nightmare Before Christmas) ------
--- Unknown ---
There are few who deny at what I do I am the best
For my talents are reowned far and wide
When it comes to surprises in the moonlit night
I excel without ever even trying
--- Unknown ---
With the slightest little effort of my ghostlike charms
I have seen grown men give out a shriek
With the wave of my hand and a well-placed moan
I have swept the very bravest off their feet
--- Unknown ---
Yet year after year it's the same routine
And I grow so weary of the sound of screams
And I Jack the PUMPKIN KING!
Have grown so tired of the same old thing...
--- Unknown ---
Oh somewhere deep inside of these bones
And emptiness begins to grow
There's something out there far from my home
A longing that I've never known
--- Unknown ---
I'm a master of fright and a demon of light
And I'll scare you right out of your pants
To a guy in Kentucky I'm Mister Unlucky
And I'm known throughout England and France
--- Unknown ---
And since I am dead I can take off my head
To recite Shakespearean quotations
No animal or man can scream like I can
With the fury of my recitations
--- Unknown ---
But who here would ever understand
That the Pumpkin King with the skeleton grin
Would tire of his crown- if they only understood
He would give it all up if he only could
--- Unknown ---
Oh there's an empty place in my bones
That calls out for something unknown
The fame and praise come year after year
