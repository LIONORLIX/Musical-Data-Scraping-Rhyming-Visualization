------ A Whole New World (Alladin) ------
--- Aladdin ---
I can show you the world
Shining, shimmering, splendid
Tell me, princess, now when did
You last let your heart decide?
--- Unknown ---
I can open your eyes
Take you wonder by wonder
Over, sideways and under
On a magic carpet ride
--- Unknown ---
A whole new world
A new fantastic point of view
No one to tell us no
Or where to go
Or say we're only dreaming
--- Jasmine ---
A whole new world
A dazzling place I never knew
But when I'm way up here
It's crystal clear
That now I'm in a whole new world with you
--- Aladdin ---
Now I'm in a whole new world with you
--- Jasmine ---
Unbelievable sights
Indescribable feeling
Soaring, tumbling, freewheeling
Through an endless diamond sky
--- Unknown ---
A whole new world
Jasmine: A hundred thousand things to see
--- Jasmine ---
I'm like a shooting star
I've come so far
I can't go back to where I used to be
--- Unknown ---
Aladdin: A whole new world
Aladdin: With new horizons to pursue
--- Both ---
I'll chase them anywhere
There's time to spare
Let me share this whole new world with you
--- Unknown ---
Aladdin: A whole new world
Aladdin: That's where we'll be
Aladdin: A thrilling chase
Jasmine: A wondrous place
