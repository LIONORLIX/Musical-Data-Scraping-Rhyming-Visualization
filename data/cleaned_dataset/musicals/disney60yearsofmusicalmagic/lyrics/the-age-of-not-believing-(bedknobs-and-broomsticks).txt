------ The Age of Not Believing (Bedknobs and Broomsticks) ------
--- Unknown ---
When you rush around in hopeless circles,
searching everywhere for something true,
you’re at the age of not believing,
when all the make-believe is through.
--- Unknown ---
When you’ve set aside your childhood heroes
and your dreams are lost upon a shelf,
you’re at the age of not believing
and, worst of all, you doubt yourself.
--- Unknown ---
You’re a castaway where no one hears you
on a barren isle in a lonely sea.
Where did all the happy endings go?
Where can all the good times be?
--- Unknown ---
You must face the age of not believing,
doubting everything you ever knew,
until at last you start believing
there’s something wonderful in you.
