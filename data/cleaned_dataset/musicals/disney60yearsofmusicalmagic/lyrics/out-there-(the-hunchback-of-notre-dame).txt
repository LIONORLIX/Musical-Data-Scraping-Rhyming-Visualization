------ Out There (The Hunchback of Notre Dame) ------
--- Frollo ---
The world is cruel
The world is wicked
It's I alone whom you can trust in this whole city
I am your only friend
I who keep you, teach you, feed you, dress you
I who look upon you without fear
How can I protect you, boy, unless you
Always stay in here
Away in here
Remember what I taught you, Quasimodo
You are deformed
--- Quasimodo ---
I am deformed
--- Frollo ---
And you are ugly
--- Quasimodo ---
And I am ugly
--- Frollo ---
And these are crimes
For which the world
Shows little pity
You do not comprehend
--- Quasimodo ---
You are my one defender
--- Frollo ---
Out there they'll revile you
As a monster
--- Quasimodo ---
I am a monster
--- Frollo ---
Out there they will hate
And scorn and jeer
--- Quasimodo ---
Only a monster
--- Frollo ---
Why invite their calumny
And consternation?
Stay in here
Be faithful to me
--- Quasimodo ---
I'm faithful
--- Frollo ---
Grateful to me
--- Quasimodo ---
I'm grateful
--- Frollo ---
Do as I say
Obey
And stay
In here
--- Quasimodo ---
I'll stay
In here
--- Quasimodo ---
Safe behind these windows and these parapets of stone
Gazing at the people down below me
All my life I watch them as I hide up here alone
Hungry for the histories they show me
All my life I memorize their faces
Knowing them as they will never know me
All my life I wonder how it feels to pass a day
Not above them
But part of them
--- Unknown ---
And out there
Living in the sun
Give me one day out there
All I ask is one
To hold forever
--- Unknown ---
Out there
Where they all live unaware
What I'd give
What I'd dare
Just to live one day out there
--- Unknown ---
Out there among the millers and the weavers and their wives
Through the roofs and gables I can see them
Ev'ry day they shout and scold and go about their lives
Heedless of the gift it is to be them
If I was in their skin
I'd treasure ev'ry instant
--- Unknown ---
Out there
Strolling by the Seine
Taste a morning out there
Like ordinary men
Who freely walk about there
Just one day and then
I swear I'll be content
With my share
Won't resent
Won't despair
Old and bent
I won't care
I'll have spent
One day
