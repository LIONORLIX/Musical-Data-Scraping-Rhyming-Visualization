------ My Own Home (The Jungle Book) ------
--- Unknown ---
My own home, my own home
My own home, my own home
--- Unknown ---
Father's hunting in the forest
Mother's cooking in the home
I must go to fetch the water
'Til the day that I'm grown
'Til I'm grown, 'til I'm grown
I must go to fetch the water
'Til the day that I'm grown
--- Unknown ---
Then I will have a handsome husband
And a daughter of my own
And I'll send her to fetch the water
I'll be cooking in the home
Then I'll send her to fetch the water
