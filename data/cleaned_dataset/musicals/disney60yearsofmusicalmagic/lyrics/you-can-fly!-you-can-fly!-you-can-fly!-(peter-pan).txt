------ You Can Fly! You Can Fly! You Can Fly! (Peter Pan) ------
--- Spoken ---
But, Peter, how do we get to Never Land?
Fly, of course!
Fly!
It's easy! All you have to do is to...is to...is to--
Huh. That's funny!
What's the matter?
Don't you know?
Oh sure, it's, it's just that I never thought about it before.
Say, that's it! You think of a wonderful thought!
Any happy little thought?
Uh-huh
Like toys at Christmas? Sleight bells? Snow?
Yep! Watch me now--here I go!
It's easier than pie!
--- Unknown ---
He can fly! He can fly! He flewed!
Now, you try
I'll think of a mermaid lagoon
Oh--underneath a magic moon
I'll think I'm in a pirate's cave
I'll think I'll be an Indian brave
Now, everybody try--one, two, three!
We can fly! We can fly! We can fly!
This won't do--what's the matter with you?
All it takes is faith and trust...oh!
And something I forgot--Dust!
Dust? Dust?
Yep! Just a little bit of pixie dust
--- Unknown ---
Now, think of the happiest things.
It's the same as having wings
Let's all try it, just once more
Look! We're rising off the floor
Jiminy! Oh my! We can fly!
You can fly! We can fly!
Come on, everybody, here we go!
Off to Never Land!
--- Unknown ---
Think of a wonderful thought
Any merry little thought
Think of Christmas, think of snow
Think of sleigh bells - off you go!
Like a reindeer in the sky
You can fly! You can fly! You can fly!
--- Unknown ---
Think of the happiest things
It's the same as having wings
Take the path that moonbeams make
If the moon is still awake
You'll see him wink his eye
You can fly! You can fly! You can fly!
--- Unknown ---
Up you go with a heigh and ho
To the stars beyoond the blue
There's a Never Land waiting for you
Where all your happy dreams come true
Every dream that you dream will come true
--- Unknown ---
When there's a smile in your heart
There's no better time to start
Think of all the joy you'll find
When you leave the world behind
And bid your cares good-bye
You can fly! You can fly! You can fly!
--- Spoken ---
There it is, Wendy, second star to the right
and straight on 'til morning
