------ I Just Can't Wait to Be King (Lion King) ------
--- YOUNG SIMBA ---
I'm gonna be a mighty king, so enemies beware!
--- ZAZU ---
[spoken] Well I've never seen a king of beasts
With quite so little hair
--- YOUNG SIMBA ---
I'm gonna be the mane event
Like no king was before
I'm brushing up on looking down
I'm working on my roar
--- ZAZU ---
[spoken] Thus far, a rather uninspiring thing
--- YOUNG SIMBA ---
Oh, I just can't wait to be king!
--- Unknown ---
No one saying do this
--- YOUNG NALA ---
No one saying be there

--- YOUNG NALA AND YOUNG SIMBA ---

Kings don't need advice
From little hornbills for a start
--- ZAZU ---

I wouldn't hang about
This child is getting wildly out of [sung] wing
--- YOUNG SIMBA ---
Oh, I just can't wait to be king
Everybody look left
--- YOUNG NALA ---
Everybody look right
--- YOUNG SIMBA ---
Everywhere you look I'm
--- YOUNG NALA AND YOUNG SIMBA ---
Standing in the spotlight
--- ZAZU ---
[spoken] Not yet!
--- YOUNG NALA, YOUNG SIMBA AND CHORUS ---
Let every creature go for broke and sing
Let's hear it in the herd and on the wing
It's gonna be King Simba's finest fling
--- YOUNG SIMBA ---
Oh, I just can't wait to be king!
--- YOUNG NALA ---
Oh, he just can't wait to be king!
--- YOUNG SIMBA ---
Oh, I just can't wait...
--- YOUNG NALA ---
Just can't wait...
--- YOUNG SIMBA AND YOUNG NALA ---
