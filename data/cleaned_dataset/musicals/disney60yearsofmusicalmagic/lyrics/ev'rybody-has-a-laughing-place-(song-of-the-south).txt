------ Ev'rybody Has a Laughing Place (Song of the South) ------
--- Unknown ---
Hee, hee, hee, hee, ha, ha, ha!
Boy am I in luck!
I think about my laughin' place,
Yuk, yuk, yuk, yuk, yuk! Ha-yuk, yuk!
--- Unknown ---
Everybody's got a laughin' place,
A laughin' place, to go ho-ho!
Take a frown, turn it upside-down,
And you'll find yours I know ho-ho!

Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!
Boy am I in luck!
I think about my laughin' place,
Ha-yuk, yuk, yuk, yuk, yuk!
--- Unknown ---
Everybody's got a laughin' place,
A laughin' place, to go ho-ho!
Take a frown, turn it upside-down,
