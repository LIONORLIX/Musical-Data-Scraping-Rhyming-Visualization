------ The Work Song (Cinderella) ------
--- Unknown ---
Every time she'd find a minute
That's the time that they begin it
Cinderelly, Cinderelly
Cinderella
--- Unknown ---
Cinderelly, Cinderelly
Night and day it's Cinderelly
Make the fire, fix the breakfast
Wash the dishes, do the mopping
And the sweeping and the dusting
They always keep her hopping
She goes around in circles
Till she's very, very dizzy
Still they holler
Keep a-busy Cinderelly
--- Unknown ---
We can do it, we can do it
We can help our Cinderelly
We can make her dress so pretty
There's nothing to it, really
We'll tie a sash around it
Put a ribbon through it
When dancing at the ball
She'll be more beautiful than all
In the lovely dress we'll make for Cinderelly
--- Unknown ---
Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry
Gonna help our Cinderelly
Got no time to dilly-dally
We gotta get a-goin'
--- Unknown ---
I'll cut it with these scissors
And I can do the sewing
Leave the sewing to the women
You go get some trimmin'
--- Unknown ---
And we'll make a lovely dress for
Cinderelly
We'll make a lovely dress for
