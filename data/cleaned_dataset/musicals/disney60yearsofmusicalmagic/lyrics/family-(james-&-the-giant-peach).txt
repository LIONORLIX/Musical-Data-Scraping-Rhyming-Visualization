------ Family (James & The Giant Peach) ------

Take a little time
Just look where we are
We´ve come very very far together
And if I mind say so
And if I mind say so too
We wouldnt have got anywhere
If werent for you, boy
--- Unknown ---
Love is the sweetest thing
Love have come just when you think well
Love is the way we feel for you
Well poundelly
We´re family
We´re family
All of us and you
--- Unknown ---
Take of where I´ll be
If we were on our own
Would be dead
Yeah but us are all together
And if I mind say so
And if we mind say so too
We never put love anyone
Like we love you
--- Unknown ---
Love is the strangest thing
Love does exectally what its want to do
Love... Boy you know it´s true
We´re family
We´re family
We´re family

--- Unknown ---
Ashes to ashes,and dust to dust
We are to that you know

Love is the sweetest thing
Love does exectally what its want to do
Love is the way we feel for you
We´re family
We´re family
