--- Unknown ---
My name is James
thats what mother called me
my name is James
so its always been
--- Unknown ---
sometimes I forget
when I'm lonely or afraid
and I'll go inside my head
and look for James
--- Unknown ---
There's a city that I dreamed of
very far from here
very very far away from here
very far away
--- Unknown ---
there are people in the city
and they come to me
but it's very very far away you know
very far away
--- Unknown ---
They'll say James, James, James how are ya ?
Isn't it a lovely day
James, James, James
were so glad you came here where we are
from so very very very far
