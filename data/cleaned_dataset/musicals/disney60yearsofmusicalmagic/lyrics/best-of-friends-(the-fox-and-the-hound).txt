------ Best of Friends (The Fox and the Hound) ------
--- Unknown ---
When you'er the best of friends,
Having so much fun together,
You're not even aware you're such a funny pair,
You're the best of friends.
--- Unknown ---
Life's a happy game,
You could clown around for ever,
Neither one of you sees your natural boundaries,
Life's one happy game.
--- Unknown ---
If only the world wouldn't get in your way,
If only people would just let you play,
They'd say you're both being fools,
You're breaking all the rules,
They can't understand,
The magic of your wonderland.
--- Unknown ---
When you're the best of friends,
Sharing all that you discover,
When these moments have passed,
Will that friendship last?
Who can't say there's a way?
Oh I hope,
I hope it never ends,
