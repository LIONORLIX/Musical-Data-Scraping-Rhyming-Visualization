The Rum Tum Tugger is a curious cat
--- TUGGER ---
If you offer me pheasant I'd rather have grouse
If you put me in a house I would much prefer a flat
If you put me in a flat then I'd rather have a house
If you set me on a mouse then I only want a rat
If you set me on a rat then I'd rather chase a mouse
--- ALL ---
The Rum Tum Tugger is a curious cat
--- TUGGER ---
And there isn't any call for me to shout it
--- ALL ---
For he will do as he do do
--- TUGGER ---
And there's no doing anything about it!

The Rum Tum Tugger is a terrible bore
--- TUGGER ---
When you let me in, then I want to go out
I'm always on the wrong side of every door
And as soon as I'm at home, then I'd like to get about
I like to lie in the bureau drawer
But I make such a fuss if I can't get out
--- ALL ---
The Rum Tum Tugger is a curious cat
--- TUGGER ---
And it isn't any use for you to doubt it
--- ALL ---
For he will do as he do do
--- TUGGER ---
And there's no doing anything about it!

The Rum Tum Tugger is a curious beast
--- TUGGER ---
My disobliging ways are a matter of habit
If you offer me fish, then I always want a feast
When there isn't any fish, then I won't eat rabbit
If you offer me cream, then I sniff and sneer
For I only like what I find for myself.. no
So you'll catch me in it right up to my ears
If you put it away on the larder shelf
--- ALL ---
The Rum Tum Tugger is artful and knowing
The Rum Tum Tugger doesn't care for a cuddle
--- TUGGER ---
But I'll leap in your lap in the middle of your sewing
For there's nothing I enjoy like a horrible muddle!
--- ALL ---
The Rum Tum Tugger is a curious cat
The Rum Tum Tugger doesn't care for a cuddle
The Rum Tum Tugger is a curious cat
--- TUGGER ---
And there isn't any need for me to spout it
--- ALL ---
For he will do as he do do
--- TUGGER ---
