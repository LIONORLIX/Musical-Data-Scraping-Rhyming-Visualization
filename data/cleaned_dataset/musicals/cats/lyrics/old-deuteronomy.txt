Old Deuteronomy's lived a long time
He's a cat who has lived many lives in succession
He was famous in proverb and famous in rhyme
A long while before Queen Victoria's accession

Old Deuteronomy's buried nine wives
And more - I am tempted to say ninety-nine
And his numerous progeny, prospers and, thrives
And the village is proud of him in his decline

At the sight of that placid and bland physiognomy
When he sits in the sun on the vicarage wall

My mind may be wandering, but I confess
I believe it is Old Deuteronomy!
