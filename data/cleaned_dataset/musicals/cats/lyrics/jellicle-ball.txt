------ Jellicle Ball ------
--- Unknown ---
Jellicle Cats come out tonight
Jellicle Cats come one, come all
The Jellicle Moon is shining bright
Jellicles come to the Jellicle Ball
--- Unknown ---
Jellicle Cats are black and white
Jellicle Cats are rather small
Jellicle Cats are merry and bright
And pleasant to hear when we caterwaul
--- Unknown ---
Jellicle Cats have cheerful faces
Jellicle Cats have bright black eyes
We like to practice our airs and graces
And wait for the Jellicle Moon to rise
--- Unknown ---
Jellicle Cats develop slowly
Jellicle Cats are not too big
Jellicle Cats are rolly poly
We know how to dance a gavotte and a jig
--- Unknown ---
Until the Jellicle Moon appears
We make our toilette and take our repose
Jellicles wash behind their ears
Jellicles dry between their toes
--- Unknown ---
Jellicle Cats are white and black
Jellicle Cats are of moderate size
Jellicles jump like a jumping jack
Jellicle Cats have moonlit eyes
--- Unknown ---
We're quiet enough in the morning hours
We're quiet enough in the afternoon
Reserving our terpsichorean powers
To dance by the light of the Jellicle Moon
--- Unknown ---
Jellicle Cats are black and white
Jellicle Cats (as we said) are small
If it happens to be a stormy night
We will pracitce a caper or two in the hall
--- Unknown ---
If it happens the sun is shining bright
You would say we had nothing to do at all
We are resting and saving ourselves to be right
For the Jellicle Moon and the Jellicle Ball
--- Unknown ---
Jellicle Cats come out tonight
Jellicle Cats come one, come all
The Jellicle Moon is shining bright
