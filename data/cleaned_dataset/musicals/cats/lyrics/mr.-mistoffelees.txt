--- Unknown ---
You ought to ask Mr. Mistoffelees
The original Conjuring Cat
The greatest magicians have something to learn
From Mr. Mistoffelees's conjuring turn
--- Unknown ---
Presto!
--- And you'll all say ---
Oh! Well I never! Was there ever
A cat so clever as magical Mr. Mistoffelees!
--- Unknown ---
Oh! Well I never! Was there ever
A cat so clever as magical Mr. Mistoffelees!
--- Unknown ---
He is quiet and small
He is black
From the ears to the tip of his tail
He can creep through the tiniest crack
He can walk on the narrowest rail
--- Unknown ---
He can pick any card from a pack
He is equally cunning with dice
He is always decieving you into believing
That he's only hunting for mice
--- Unknown ---
He can play any trick with a cork
Or a spoon and a bit of fish paste
If you look for a knife or a fork
And you think it was merely misplaced
--- Unknown ---
You have seen it one moment, and then it is gone!
But you find it next week lying out on the lawn!
--- And we all say ---
Oh! Well I never! Was there ever
A cat so clever as magical Mr. Mistoffelees!
--- Unknown ---
Oh! Well I never! Was there ever
A cat so clever as magical Mr. Mistoffelees!
--- Unknown ---
His manner is vague and aloof
You would think there was nobody shyer
But his voice has been heard on the roof
When he was curled up by the fire
--- Unknown ---
And he's sometimes been heard by the fire
When he was about on the roof
Which is uncontestable proof
--- Unknown ---
Of his singular magical powers
And I've known the family to call
Him in from the garden for hours
When he was asleep in the hall
--- Unknown ---
And not long ago this phenomenal cat
Produced seven kittens right out of a hat!
--- And we all say ---
Oh! Well I never! Was there ever
A cat so clever as magical Mr. Mistoffelees!
--- Unknown ---
Oh! Well I never! Was there ever
A cat so clever as magical Mr. Mistoffelees!
--- Unknown ---
Ladies and gentlemen
I give you the marvelous
Magical Mr. Mistoffelees!
