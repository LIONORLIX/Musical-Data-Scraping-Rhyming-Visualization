------ Prologue: Jellicle Songs for Jellicle Cats ------
--- Unknown ---
Are you blind when you're born?
Can you see in the dark?
Can you look at a king? Would you sit on his throne?
Can you say of your bite that it's worse than your bark?
Are you cock of the walk when you're walking alone?
--- Unknown ---
Because Jellicles are and Jellicles do
Jellicles do and Jellicles would
Jellicles would and Jellicles can
Jellicles can and Jellicles do
--- Unknown ---
When you fall on your head, do you land on your feet?
Are you tense when you sense there's a storm in the air?
Can you find your way blind when you're lost in the street?
Do you know how to go to the Heaviside Layer?
--- Unknown ---
Because Jellicles can and Jellicles do
Jellicles do and Jellicles can
Jellicles can and Jellicles do
Jellicles do and Jellicles can
Jellicles can and Jellicles do
--- Unknown ---
Can you ride on a broomstick to places far distant?
Familiar with candle, with book and with bell?
Were you Whittington's friend? The Pied Piper's assistant?
Have you been an alumnus of heaven or hell?
--- Unknown ---
Are you mean like a minx?
Are you lean like a linx?
Are you keen to be seen when you're smelling a rat?
Where you there when the pharaohs commissioned the Sphinx?
If you were and you are, you're a Jellicle Cat

We can dive through the air like a flying trapeze
We can turn double somersaults, bounce on a tire
We can run up the wall, we can swing through the trees
We can balance on bars, we can walk on a wire

Jellicles can and Jellicles do
Jellicles can and Jellicles do
Jellicles can and Jellicles do

Can you sing at the same time in more than one key
Duets by Rossini and waltzes by Strauss
And can you (as cats do) begin with a C
That always triumphantly brings down the house

Singing at astronomical heights
Handling pieces from the Messiah
Hallelujah, angelical choir

There's a man over there with a look of surprise,
As much as to say, Well now how about that!
Do I actually see with my own very eyes
A man who's not heard of a Jellicle Cat?
What's a Jellicle cat?
