------ Grizabella: The Glamour Cat ------
--- Unknown ---
Remark the Cat who hesitates towards you
In the light of the door which opens on her like a grin
--- Unknown ---
You see the border of her coat is torn and stained with sand
And you see the corner of her eye twist like a crooked pin
--- Unknown ---
She haunted many a low resort
Near the grimy road of Tottenham Court
She flitted about the no man's land
From the rising sun to the friend at hand
And the postman sighed as he scratched his head
You merely have thought she ought to be dead
And who would ever suppose that cat was Grizabella, the Glamour cat
--- Unknown ---
Grizabella the Glamour Cat
Grizabella the Glamour Cat
Who would ever suppose that that
