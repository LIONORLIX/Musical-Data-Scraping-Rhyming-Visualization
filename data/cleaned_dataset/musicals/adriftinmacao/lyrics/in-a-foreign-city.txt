------ In A Foreign City ------
--- Unknown ---
In a foreign city
In a slinky dress
The weather's looking stormy,
My hair is quite a mess
I lost my lover Billy
Unlucky me, I guess
Now I'm in a foreign city
In a slinky dress
--- Unknown ---
My other clothes are gone now
The hotel kept them all
'Cause Billy took our money
I guess I took a fall
When Billy said to kiss him
Oh why did I say yes?
Now I'm in a foreign city
In a slinky dress
--- Unknown ---
Got bad taste choosing a lover
I sure can't pick 'em
It's simply insane
When it's time to run for cover
I'm like a fool who thinks it's sunny
When it's pouring rain
--- Unknown ---
I'm in a foreign city
In a slinky dress
The rickshaw boys ignore me
So what? I could care less
I need a job tomorrow
I'm scared, I must confess
Scared to be in a foreign city
In a slinky dress
A slinky dress
