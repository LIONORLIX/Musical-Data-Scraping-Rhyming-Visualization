------ They Were You ------
--- Unknown ---
When the moon was young,
When the month was May,
When the stage was hung for my holiday,
I saw shining lights
But I never knew:
They were you.
They were you.
They were you.
--- Unknown ---
When the dance was done,
When I went my way,
When I tried to find rainbows far away,
All the lovely lights
Seemed to fade from view:
They were you.
They were you.
They were you.
--- Unknown ---
Without you near me,
I can't see.
When you're near me,
Wonderful things come to be.
--- Unknown ---
Every secret prayer,
Every fancy free,
Everything I dared for both you and me.
All my wildest dreams
Multiplied by two
They were you.
They were you.
They were you.
--- Unknown ---
They were you.
They were you.
