------ I Can See It ------

Beyond that road lies a shining world.
Beyond that road lies despair.
Beyond that road lies a world that's gleaming.
People who are scheming.
Beauty!
Hunger!
Glory!
Sorrow!
Never a pain or care.
He's liable to find a couple of surprises there.
--- Unknown ---
There's a song he must sing;
It's a well-known song.
But the tune is bitter
And it doesn't take long to learn!
--- Unknown ---
I can learn!
That pretty little world that beams so bright.
That pretty little world that seems delightful
Can burn! Burn! Burn!
Let me learn! Let me learn!
--- Unknown ---
For, I can see it!
Shining somewhere!
Bright lights somewhere invite me to come there
And learn!
And I'm ready!
--- Unknown ---
I can hear it!
Sirens singing!
Inside my ear I hear them all singing
Come learn!
--- Unknown ---
Who knows, maybe
All the visions I can see
May be waiting just for me
To say take me there, and
--- Unknown ---
Make me see it!
Make me feel it!
I know it's so
I know that it really
May be!
Let me learn!
--- Unknown ---
I can see it!
Shining somewhere!
--- Unknown ---
Those lights not only glitter
But once there they burn!
--- Unknown ---
I can hear it!
Sirens singing!
--- Unknown ---
Don't listen close
Or maybe you'll never
Return!
--- Unknown ---
Who know, maybe
All the visions that I (he) sees
May be waiting just for me (him) to
Say
--- Unknown ---
I can see it!
Say
Shining somewhere!
Say
Let me see it!
Say
Take me there
And make me a part of it!
--- Unknown ---
Make me see
Those shining sights inside of me!
--- Unknown ---
Make me feel
Those lights inside
Don't lie to me!
--- Unknown ---
I (he) know(s) it's so --
I (he) know(s) that it really may be!
--- Unknown ---
Just what I always waited for!
This is what my life's created for!
