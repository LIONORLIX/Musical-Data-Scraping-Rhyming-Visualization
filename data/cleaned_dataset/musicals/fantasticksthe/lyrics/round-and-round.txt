Round and round,
Till the break of day.
Candles glow,
Fiddles play.
Why not be wild if we feel that way?
Reckless and terribly gay!
--- Unknown ---
Round and round,
'Neath a magic spell.
Velvet gown,
Pink lapel.
Life is a colorful carousel.
Reckless and terribly gay!
--- Unknown ---
I'm ready anytime.
If you'll take me, I'm
Ready to go!
--- Unknown ---
So show the way to me.
I will try to be
Ready to go!

We're on a lagoon.
A gondolier's crooning
A gondola tune.

I seem to see Athens, it's terribly chic.
Atop the Acrop'lis, it's terribly Greek.
There's Venus, Adonis, 'n us
Cheek to cheek.
--- Unknown ---
Oh how chic!

To be Greek cheek to cheek!
