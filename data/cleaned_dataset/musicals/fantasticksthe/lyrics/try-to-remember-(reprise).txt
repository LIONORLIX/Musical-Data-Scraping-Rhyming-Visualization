------ Try To Remember (Reprise) ------
--- Unknown ---
Love! You are love!
Better far than a metaphor
Can ever, ever be.
Love! (Love!)
You are love! (You are love!)
My mystery (My mystery)
Of love!

Deep in December,
It's nice to remember,
Although you know the snow will follow.
Deep in December,
It's nice to remember,
Without a hurt the heart is hollow.
Deep in December,
It's nice to remember,
The fire of September that made us mellow.
Deep in December,
Our hearts should remember
