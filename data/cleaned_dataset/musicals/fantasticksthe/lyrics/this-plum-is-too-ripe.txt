------ This Plum Is Too Ripe ------
--- Unknown ---
This plum is too ripe!
- Sorry!
Take away the golden moonbeam.
Take away the tinsel sky.
What at night seems oh so scenic
May be cynic by and by.
--- Unknown ---
Take away the painted sunset.
Take away the blue lagoon.
What at night seems oh so scenic
May be cynic much too soon.
--- Unknown ---
Take away the sense of drama.
Take away the puppet play.
What at night seems oh so scenic
May be cynic by today.
--- Unknown ---
Take away the secret meetings.
Take away the chance to fight.
What at night seems oh so scenic
May be cynic in the light.
--- Unknown ---
So take it away and paint it up right!
So take it away and decorate it!
So take it away; that sun is too bright!
I say that it really is a pity.
It used to be so pretty.
