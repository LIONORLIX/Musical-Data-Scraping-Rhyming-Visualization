------ Every Night ------
--- NIKKI ---
How does she do this to me?
How did I let her in?
When I should know by now to beware
--- HELEN ---
Why does she do this to me?
How can I ever win?
And though I tell myself I don?t care
--- BOTH ---
She?s always there?
--- NIKKI ---
Every night I see her
The moment I close my eyes to sleep
She?s there in the dreams I keep
In my heart
--- HELEN ---
Every night I see her
Somehow she?s always on my mind
And maybe I?ve just been blind
From the start
--- BOTH ---
All my defenses
Lie here broken in two
I try to wake up and come to my senses
But there?s no way through
What else can I do?
--- Unknown ---
Every day I see her
Daring my heart to cross that line
Ignore every danger sign
And fail
Hopelessly lost
To risk it all
Whatever the cost
But inside I know
I am only falling apart
--- HELEN ---
Every night I see her
--- NIKKI ---
Every night I see her
--- HELEN ---
The moment I close my eyes to sleep
--- NIKKI ---
She?s in my dreams
--- HELEN ---
This secret is burning deep
--- NIKKI ---
Burning deep
--- BOTH ---
In my heart
--- Unknown ---
But this is crazy
What am I thinking?
I?m losing my way in the dark
--- HELEN ---
It?s just too much
--- NIKKI ---
It?s not enough
--- HELEN ---
To see her face every day
--- NIKKI ---
When there?s so much to say
--- HELEN ---
To feel her so close yet so far
--- NIKKI ---
To feel her so close yet so far
--- HELEN ---
When nothing can change
Who we are
--- NIKKI ---
When nothing can change
Who we are
But I can?t let her go
--- HELEN ---
But I can?t let her know
--- BOTH ---
Every night I see her
The moment I close my eyes to sleep
The secret is burning deep
In my heart
