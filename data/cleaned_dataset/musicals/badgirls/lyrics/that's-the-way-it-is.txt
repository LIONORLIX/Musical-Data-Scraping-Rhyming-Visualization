------ That's the Way It Is ------
--- PRISONERS ---
Now we know where we stand
There is no no-man?s land
Trust is torn a line is drawn
And that?s the way it is!
--- Unknown ---
Make your move, take your side
There is no place to hide
You?re out on a limb, now sink or swim
?Cos that?s the way it is!
--- HELEN ---
What the hell?s the commotion? Well?
--- SYLVIA ---
We?ve got a swinger. Ma?am. Rachel Hicks.
--- HELEN ---
Oh no?
--- SYLVIA ---
Mr Fenner?s cutting the corpse down now, if you want to take a look?
Right you lot ? back to your cells. Now. Move it!
--- YVONNE ---
We?re not going anywhere.
--- SHELL ---
Ain?t our fault poor Rachel?s dead, is it?
--- HELEN ---
Listen. I know you?ve all had a terrible shock.
But you?re not going to solve anything by kicking off.
--- NIKKI ---
What do you expect? Rachel?s dead.
--- YVONNE ---
That kid was right as rain last night. Why would she suddenly go and top herself?
--- HELEN ---
I assure you ? there will be a full investigation into how and why this happened.
--- NIKKI ---
It happened because she was banged up in prison. (pointing at Jim)
With bastards like him on the loose.
--- JULIE J ---
His last one ended up down the muppet wing.
--- JULIE S ---
Yeah. He?s the one should be swinging!
--- PRISONERS ---
No matter how you try to sweep us out of sight
We will not let this day go by
All of your might
Cannot fight what is right
And that?s the way it is now
Bring it on down
--- HELEN ---
I want you all to go back to your cells. Quietly and calmly.
--- THE NUMBER ONE ---
What is going on here?
--- YVONNE ---
A bloody crime. And you?re not going to get away with it.
--- JIM ---
Miss Stewart?s given you a Governor?s order here.
Return to your cells now or the riot team?s coming in.
--- HELEN ---
Wait. Wait. Nikki ? can I talk to you, please?
--- SHELL ---
Oi, bitch. Who?s side you on?
--- HELEN ---
I?m asking to talk to Nikki on behalf of you all!
--- YVONNE ---
Then talk to us all. Explain to us why Rachel?s dead.
--- PRISONERS ---
?Cos if you think we?ll walk away
As if nothing really matters
Then there is nothing more to say?
--- JIM ---
Ask Wade. That?s who Rachel was scared of.
--- NIKKI ---
Go screw yourself, Fenner!
--- PRISONERS & OFFICERS ---
That?s the way it is!
Come on, come on.
That?s the way it is!
Come on, come on.
That?s the way it is!
Come on, come on.
That?s the way it is!
--- Unknown ---
Bring it on down
That?s the way it is!
Come on, come on.
Bring it on down
That?s the way it is!
Come on, come on.
Bring it on down
That?s the way it is!
Come on, come on.
That?s the way it is!
That?s the way it is!
--- PRISONERS ---
Come on, come on
Come on, come on
Come on, come on
Come on, come on
--- JIM ---
Get to your cells now! Stay back!
--- SYLVIA ---
Move it!
--- HELEN ---
Please don?t do this.
--- YVONNE ---
Better tool up, girls!
--- THE NUMBER ONE ---
