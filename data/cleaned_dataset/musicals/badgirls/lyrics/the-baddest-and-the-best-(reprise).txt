------ The Baddest and the Best (Reprise) ------
--- SHELL ---
If you?re gonna be bad
You gotta be the baddest and the best
When you?ve been messed around and trampled down
Get it off your chest
No you don?t get mad
You just get badder than all the rest
Who?s the baddest girl in town?
The baddest and the best!
