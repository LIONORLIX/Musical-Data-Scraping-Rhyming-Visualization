------ A-List ------
--- YVONNE ---
When you?re all dolled up with no place to go
Hey! Don?t make a fuss
If we can?t get out to the party
The party can come to us!
--- Unknown ---
It?s strictly A-List
This?ll be the hottest spot in town
Sun-kissed celebrities with style
Call OK and Hello!
Now we?re all set to go
We?re gonna make a splash
Get ready to flash that smile
--- Unknown ---
It?s strictly A-List
Everyone who?s anyone is here
Hey sister, your name is on the door
Roll the red carpet out
?Cos tonight there?s no doubt
We?re having a girls? night in
Like there?s never been before
--- Unknown ---
I?m gonna be the party queen
Giving it up all night
Cruising and schmoozing with the best
Take a look around this exclusive scene
So much flesh to be pressed
Oh yes
--- Unknown ---
It?s strictly A-List
Listen to the word out on the street
Don?t miss the party of the year
No ?B?s, no ?C?s
And darling please, no ?D?s
No has-beens, would be?s
Wannabes, could be?s
I absolutely must insist
Strictly ?A?s on the list
--- Unknown ---
We need jhoojh and pizzazz
And some glamour in our lives
Out of the razz
Like we?re Footballer?s Wives
--- Unknown ---
Low cut
Uplift
You are
God?s gift
Go strut your stuff on the floor
--- PRISONERS ---
Go strut your stuff
--- YVONNE ---
Big hair
Bling bling
Hot air
Mingling
This is the life I adore
--- PRISONERS ---
Can?t get enough!
--- YVONNE & PRISONERS ---
It?s strictly A-List
Listen to the word out on the street
Don?t miss the party of the year
No ?B?s, no ?C?s
But maybe I could squeeze some ?E?s
No has-beens, would be?s
Wannabes, could be?s
--- PRISONERS ---
No has-beens, would be?s
Wannabes, could be?s
--- YVONNE ---
I absolutely must insist?
--- YVONNE & PRISONERS ---
We?re on the A-List
Come out and play list
Won?t stop till we drop
?Cos we?re on the top tonight
Hey, mister!
Hey, mister!
Hey, mister!
Don?t turn out that light!
--- Unknown ---
Party all night
Bad Girls party all night
Party all night
Bad Girls party all night
Party all night
Bad Girls party on
Party all night!
