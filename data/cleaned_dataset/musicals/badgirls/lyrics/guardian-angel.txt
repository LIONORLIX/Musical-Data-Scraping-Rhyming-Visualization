------ Guardian Angel ------
--- SHELL ---
Look at me
Look at how I turned out
Used to be a scaredy-cat until
I learned how
To stand up for myself
?Cos ain?t nobody else
Who?s gonna make your life worthwhile
--- Unknown ---
Look at you
--- DENNY ---
The girl can?t take it
--- SHELL ---
Everything about you says
You?ll never make it
And grassing to a screw
Ain?t a clever thing to do
Unless you suit a Chelsea smile
--- Unknown ---
Such a pretty little thing
I wouldn?t linger in the showers
Every lezzer on the wing
Will want their go
--- DENNY ---
You?ll be stuck in there for hours
--- SHELL ---
The days are long and the nights are scary
--- DENNY ---
Them girls are strong and some quite hairy
--- DENNY ---
Most nights the screaming never ends
That?s when you need to know
That you?ve got friends?
--- SHELL ---
And I?ll be watching over you
--- DENNY ---
We?ll be watching over you
--- SHELL ---
Like a Guardian Angel
Anytime you look behind you
--- DENNY ---
Don?t look now
--- SHELL ---
You know I?ll always find you
I?ll know everything you do
--- DENNY ---
Everything you do
--- SHELL ---
I?m your Guardian Angel
Nothing happens here I don?t see
Nothing?s said that won?t get back to me
Lucky you that I?m gonna be your Angel
--- Unknown ---
It?s a fact
Prison is depressing
--- DENNY ---
Better just accept it there?s no point in stressing
--- SHELL ---
The only way to cope
Instead of losing hope
Is get completely off your face
--- Unknown ---
Now I?m a mate
Who believes in sharing
--- DENNY ---
People don?t appreciate that Shell?s so caring
--- SHELL ---
A little Billy Whiz
Will really do the biz
And then it?s gone without a trace
--- Unknown ---
When you?re crawling up the wall
You just call and I?ll come flying
--- SHELL & DENNY ---
Take your pick ? we?ve got it all
--- SHELL ---
Just let me know
--- DENNY ---
We do regular supplying
--- SHELL ---
Have a wrap
--- DENNY ---
No one?s touched it
--- SHELL ---
Except perhaps the girl who crutched it
Just pay your bills and you?ll be fine
--- DENNY ---
Can I have that necklace, Shell?
--- SHELL ---
Help yourself, Den.
--- Unknown ---
And remember now ? what?s yours is mine
--- Unknown ---
?Cos I?ll be watching you
--- DENNY ---
We?ll be watching over you
--- SHELL ---
Like a Guardian Angel
Anytime you look behind you
--- DENNY ---
Don?t look now
--- SHELL ---
You know I?ll always find you
I?ll know everything you do
--- DENNY ---
Everything you do
--- SHELL ---
I?m your Guardian Angel
Nothing happens here I don?t see
Nothing?s said that won?t get back to me
Lucky you that I?m gonna be your Angel
--- Unknown ---
Your Guardian Angel
