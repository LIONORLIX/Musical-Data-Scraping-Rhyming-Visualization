------ Wild Party ------

(we see Queenie lying in bed.
Though the domestic «drama» which unfolds
Is informed by real emotions- it is
Performed stylistically, as if it were a vaudeville skit)
--- Unknown ---
Queenie
Queenie is so»(yawn)»ah well.
She»s awful awful tired.
She needs her cup of java
So Queenie can get wired.

Can»t lift a singly toe.

Mama needs her cuppa joe.

Burrs
A woman who sleeps till half past two
Then wakes up tired
Whadddya do with a woman who sleeps
Like the stone-deaf dead---
Needs a kick in the ass
Or a smack in the head---
--- Unknown ---
Queenie
Burrsie! Pour me a cup of coffee.

Burrs

You think you»re the Prince of Whales» Or what»
--- Unknown ---
(Queenie ignores Burrs)
--- Unknown ---
Well»! Queenie! QUEENIE.
--- Unknown ---
(as music blares, Burrs grabs
Queenie and pulls her into her bed,
Kissing her. A struggle ensues. Queenie
Breaks free, he goes chasing after her
with a shoe, she grabs a knife.
All motion abruptly stops- the vaudeville
Of their marriage has turned into something
Dangerous, deadly)
--- Unknown ---
Queenie
You touch me- I»ll kill you, you filthy bastard.

Don't I know what»s best for you?
Sure I know what»s best for you.
