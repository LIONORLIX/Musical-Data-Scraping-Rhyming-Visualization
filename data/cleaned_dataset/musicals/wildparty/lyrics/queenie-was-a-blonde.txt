------ Queenie Was A Blonde ------
--- Queenie ---
Queenie was a blonde,
And her age stood still,
And she danced twice a day
In vaudeville.
Queenie was a blonde,
And if looks could kill,
She would kille twice a day,
In vaudeville.
She had grey eyes,
Lips like coals aglow.
And her face was a tinted
mask of snow.
With those shoulders,
What a back she had.
Her legs were built to drive men crazy.
--- Unknown ---
And she did.
--- Unknown ---
She would skid.
--- Men ---
She had grey eyes,
Lips like coals aglow.
And her face was a tinted
mask of snow.
--- Queenie ---
With those shoulders,
What a back she had.
Her legs were built to drive men --
--- Men ---
Her legs were built...
Her legs were built to drive men --
--- Queenie ---

But how was she to love them?
There were far too many of them.
--- Men ---
She never got tired
of the men she desired.
She never inquired of the men
she desired.

She never inquired
of the men she desired
Of their status or their wealth,
They were all in perfect health.
--- Queenie ---
True so true

Queenie was
a blonde and her
age stood still.
--- Queenie ---
And Queenie
knew
--- Men ---
True,
She knew.
--- Queenie & Men ---
That she liked her lovers violent.
And she likes her lovers vicious.
But until she found the one man
Who could answer all her wishes
--- Men ---
Queenie was sexually ambitious.
Capricious.
--- Queenie ---
So delicious.

Are you ready to smile?
Are you ready to sing?
and dance for a while?
Before too long

They shouted out his name
Proclaiming he was grand

He was mean
and rough

He was made
of vile and violent
stuff

They likes him
tough.
--- Girls ---
Get in his way
And he would

--- Burrs ---
He was a very scary clown!
He didn't want to be bad. He was
bored. He was sore. He was dying
for me.
