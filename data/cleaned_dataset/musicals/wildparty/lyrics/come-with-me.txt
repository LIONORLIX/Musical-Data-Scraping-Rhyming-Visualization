------ Come With Me ------
--- BLACK ---
Like a tiger in a cage
I'm prowling
Like an actor on a stage
I'm howling
Wishing
Wanting
Waiting for the drum
Set me free
--- ENSEMBLE ---
Come with me.
--- QUEENIE ---
Like an eagle in the sky
I'm screaming
Like an angel passing by
I'm dreaming
Holy
Hungry
Hoping for a crumb
Set me free
--- ENSEMBLE ---
Come with me.
--- BLACK ---
I'll be waiting forever for you
--- ENSEMBLE ---
Come with me.
--- BLACK ---
Celebrating the magic of two
--- ENSEMBLE ---
Come with me.
--- BLACK ---
Only do what the animals do
And all will be righted
Our passion ignited
Tonight.
--- ENSEMBLE ---
Come with me.
--- BLACK MEN ---
Like a preacher at the book Don't you want to be the life of the party?
I'm chanting
WOMEN
Come with,
Come with
Like a farmer and his hook Come with,
I'm planting Come with me
--- ALL ---
Spread the seed
Sowing And feed
The hunger
Growing
Knowing you can hum Hum...
--- Unknown ---
Set me free Don't you wanna be
Footloose and free?
--- BLACK & ENSEMBLE ---
Come with me.
--- QUEENIE ALL ---
Like a member of the pack
I ramble
Like a member of the pack
I ramble
Like a ledger in the black
I gamble
Like a ledger in the black
I gamble
--- Unknown ---
Add the columns TWO MEN
Roll the dice,
Calculate the sum Then throw the rice
And rhumba to the sea
Set me free
--- ENSEMBLE ---
Come with me.
BLACK
Always knew that
This day would arrive
Come with me.
QUEENIE
Good for me
That you made it alive
--- BLACK ---
Come with me. Just remember,
The fittest survive
--- ALL ---
And all will be righted
Our passion ignited
Tonight
--- QUEENIE BLACK ---
Come with me. I can lead but
I can't make you drink
--- ENSEMBLE QUEENIE ---
Come with me. I'll concede
You've got more than I think
--- Unknown ---
Come with me.
--- BLACK ---
And the mood may be gone in a wink
So let's get this started
Before I've departed
Don't want to leave empty -
Or worse, broken-hearted
I know you're the one
And before the night's done
We'll be free
Come with me.
--- BLACK, QUEENIE & ENSEMBLE ---
Come with me!
Come with me!
