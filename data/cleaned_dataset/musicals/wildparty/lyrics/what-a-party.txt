------ What A Party ------
--- OFFSTAGE VOICES ---
And the gang took wing,
And the shadows leapt,
Any fool could see -
What a party.
--- ENSEMBLE ---
And the gang took wing,
And the shadows leapt,
Any fool could see -
What a party.
--- Unknown ---
While the candles glared
And the neighbors wept
Any swell could be
At a party.
--- Unknown ---
Lightly,
Quickly,
Slightly sickly
Pasty,
Tasty,
Like birds of prey
'Round the hors d'oeuvre tray.
--- Unknown ---
When the laughter starts
And the game begins
You can guarantee
That's how to blow
That's how to grow
That how to throw a party!

Crowded,
Smartly shrouded.
Drinking,
Stinking,
Till by and by
They began to fly.

Oooh:
And the gang took wing,
And the clock ticked on
Any fool could see,
What a party.
--- Unknown ---
For the mood could swing
When the blues got gone
While the booze was free
At a party.
--- Unknown ---
Panting,
Prying,
Loudly lying,
Raving,
Craving
Like birds of prey
'Round the hors d'oeuvre tray -
--- Unknown ---
(Queenie appears, dressed all in white.)
--- BURRS ---
But tonight,
Queenie surpassed them all,
And tonight,
Queenie stood firm and tall.
--- ENSEMBLE ---
With a face of ivory,
And gold for hair.
--- BURRS ---
She was something
To kneel before in prayer.
My God,
Queenie,
You're looking swell.
