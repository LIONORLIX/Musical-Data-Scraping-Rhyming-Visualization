------ After Midnight Dies ------
--- Unknown ---
Sally
Down goes the wall
Down goes the guard
After midnight dies
It ain’t so hard
To see the truth.
No need for lies.
What we are is all we are
After midnight dies.

(Sally wanders around the party. A
Disheveled Eddie crosses to Mae, who
Sits alone. On the other side of the room,
Oscar crosses to Phil, who’s asleep at
The piano)
