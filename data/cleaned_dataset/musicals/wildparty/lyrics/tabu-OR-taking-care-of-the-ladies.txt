Tabu!
When you’re forbidden your desire.
Tabu!
You yearn to play with fire?
--- Unknown ---
Queenie
So, mister black, show me.
--- Unknown ---
Black
Show you what?
--- Unknown ---
Queenie
The game, the hustle. Or is this it?
--- Unknown ---
Black
Believe me, if black was running the
Mooch, you’d be in his arms begging him
To never leave you.
--- Unknown ---
Queenie
So go on, mooch me.
--- Unknown ---
Black
Right here? Right now?
--- Unknown ---
Queenie
Umhm.
--- Unknown ---
Black
You sure you’re ready? Cause if you melt or swoon or-
--- Unknown ---
Queenie
The mooch?
--- Unknown ---
Black
Black likes the way that you
look tonight
Elegant, sleek and cool
Black likes the way that you
shake the moves:
So beautiful  but watch it-
A panther’s trapped inside:
tell me- who rolls your cigarettes
--- Unknown ---
And keeps you satisfied?
Taking care of the ladies
I take care of myself.
Black’s glad to send you
Where you wanna go
And baby it’s your party
What more ya wanna know?
What more ya wanna know?
What more?
--- Unknown ---
Queenie
I can see how that might work on some
Women-desperate, lonely.
--- Unknown ---
Black
But not you.
--- Unknown ---
Queenie
Nope.
--- Unknown ---
Black
O.k. Here’s another mooch. It’s sunday
Night and this woman i know, let’s call
Her kate, an acquaintance, is invited to
This party and she drags me along.
--- Unknown ---
Queenie
Drags you?
--- Unknown ---
Black
‘And the second i walk in i see this
Other woman; blonde, beautiful-and the
Way she holds her cigarette, the way her
Hand folds on her hip?
--- Unknown ---
Black likes the way that
She burns tonight
Ginger and smoke and sex
Black likes the way that she likes him back:
--- Unknown ---
Everything about her
Says ‘danger-run away’
But something in her eyes seems to
Be begging me to stay?
Taking care of the ladies
I take care of myself
Everything about her says ‘danger - stay away’
But danger and a woman
More i gotta say
What more
What more.
--- Unknown ---
For a guy i talk a lot
We oughta just listen to the music
We oughta just dance
--- Unknown ---
Oscar
