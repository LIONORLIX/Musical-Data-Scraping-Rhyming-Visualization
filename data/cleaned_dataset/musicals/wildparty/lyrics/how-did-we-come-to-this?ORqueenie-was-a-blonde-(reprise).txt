------ How Did We Come To This?/Queenie Was A Blonde (Reprise) ------
--- QUEENIE ---
We're all so sure
We're all so wise
No limits
No boundaries
No compromise.
Laughing at our neighbor
Smiling through a hiss
How did we come to this?
--- Unknown ---
We're all amuse
We're al inspired
So cunning
So clever
And so admired
Easy to be angry
Easy to dismiss
How did we come to this?
--- Unknown ---
Maybe I've been living in a daydream
Maybe I've been talking in my sleep
If I've been awake
Pardon my mistake
But time is running low
And talk is growing cheap.
--- Unknown ---
We play our games
We place our bets
No witness
No weakness
And no regrets.
Filling up with frenzy
Killing with a kiss
How did we all come to this?
--- Unknown ---
Time goes by
Plans grow stale
People die
And parties fail
How did we come to this?
--- ENSEMBLE ---
She had grey eyes,
Lips like coals aglow.
And her face was a tinted mask of snow.
--- Unknown ---
A fascinating woman
