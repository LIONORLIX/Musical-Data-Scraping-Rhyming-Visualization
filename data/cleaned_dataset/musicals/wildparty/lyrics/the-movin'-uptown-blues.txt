Gold & Goldberg
Walked in that door tonight and wham ‘

Don’t got a past
Don’t got a name
Can’t go back to
From wherever I came
Whole room’s spinning crazy
Someone make it stop

A promise made in the throes of passion
Is a promise to be kept. Violate that
Promise and the terrible things can happen.
Hell hath no fury like a woman’per-
