Kate
Loverman’s in love’
Go on- be ‘in love’ ‘ ain’t it sweet’
Come morning she’ll be back
In the arms of that clown
And loverman, you ass will be
Out in the street
And then what’
Back to peddling that old mooch’
‘black likes the way that you
Look tonight:
Elegant, sleek and cool.’
It’s getting old. You’re getting old ‘
There are younger men out there now. Mister black.
I’m gonna tell you something:
Something i learned long ago:                           [‘too long ago’ ]
Love ain’t nothin’ but a whole lotta nothing’
And you know what it’s really about’
It’s about comfort, not love, loverman
It’s about comfort
And keepin’ hold of it, hangin’ on to it
And doin’ whatever it takes
To get more
Love ain’t nothin’ but a whole lotta nothin’
A whole lotta nothin’!
