------ When The Golden Boy Goes Down ------

Eddie
When the Golden Boy goes down
Hell, the crowd they get mean,
Can’t believe what they’ve seen,
Can’t be true.
When the Golden Boy goes down
Fate steps up with a crunch
Lands a dirty left punch
And you’re lunch for the newspapers ‘
Give us a smile boy!
You’re the pride of your race!
- Hey wait, use the back door.
Remember your place.
You can look at the white girls, sure;
But Champ, don’t you touch.
When the Golden Boy went down,
Did I feel like a hero’
Not much’

And we’ll both be back in each other’s arms
Come morn
M-m-m-m-m-m-m-m

Eddie
When the Golden Boy went down
Did I feel like a hero’
Not much’
Not much’

(as Eddie/Mae and Oscar/Phil kiss,
Sally wanders until she finds Gold and
Goldberg sitting at the kitchen table, in
Partial status if undress, very drunk and
Very lost)
