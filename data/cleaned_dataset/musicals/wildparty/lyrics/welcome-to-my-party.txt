Who the hell invited you?

You’re here because you love me.
Don’t I know it? Yeh I know.
You’re here because you love me

And the lowdown’s  low.

Welcome to my party.
You know what I need
Queenie’s up for jazzin’
Queenie’s up for anything
Tonight!
--- Unknown ---
I gotta get my engines smokin’
I need it bad and God I need it
More
I needa lot of friendly strokin’
There ain’t no heaven
And there ain’t no hell
No turnin’ back
Daddy lock the door!
Welcome!

The traffic roar-!

The creatures of the night
Have come here to play
We don’t need the light
And we don’t like the day
People like us
Gotta jazz till we drop
Cuz people like us
We don’t know when to stop-

Queenie’s guarantee
Welcome to my party
Wanna get creamed?
Wanna get juiced?
Wanna get wild?
Follow me!
