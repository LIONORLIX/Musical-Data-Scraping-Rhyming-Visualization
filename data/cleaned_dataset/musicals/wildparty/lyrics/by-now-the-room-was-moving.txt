------ By Now The Room Was Moving ------
--- PHIL & OSCAR ---
By now the room was moving
--- MAE ---
And Queenie set to pounce
--- ENSEMBLE ---
The gang at last
Was grooving fast
--- OSCAR ---
Progressing ounce by ounce.
--- BURRS ---
She knew that Burrs could harm her
--- EDDIE ---
But she was feelin' strange
--- ENSEMBLE ---
So through the wine
She drew the line and said
--- QUEENIE ---
Time to make a change
--- ENSEMBLE ---
Queenie
Kate
Burrs
Black
The night was moving forward
Not back
Not back
--- MAX ---
Then with no inhibition
--- SAM ---
Went Kate to conquer all
--- KATE ---
She fought to win
--- ENSEMBLE ---
She zeroed in
--- KATE ---
To see who'd bag the ball.
--- ENSEMBLE ---
And Black took his position
To swiftly take the floor
--- BLACK ---
They'd start the dance
He'd get his chance
In just one minute more
--- ENSEMBLE ---
Queenie
Burrs
Black
Kate
And what was the order of business?
Some love
Some hate
--- Unknown ---
They formed the figuration
They poured it down the hatch
And one wrong turn
The whole place would burn
--- BURRS ---
But who would strike the match?
--- QUEENIE ---
Who would strike the match?
--- QUEENIE, BURRS, BLACK, KATE ---
Who's it gonna be?
Who's it gonna be?
Who's it gonna be?
--- ALL ---
Who's it gonna be?
--- Unknown ---
QUEENIE (approaching Black, seductively)
I don't know you, we've hardly spoken but
I was wondering -
Are you available?
--- Unknown ---
While you're waiting for Kate to hurry back
I was hoping that Maybe we'd dance a while.
--- BLACK ---
I'm available and I'd love to dance
Won't you offer your hand to me, Queenie?
Let's dance.
--- Unknown ---
(They dance.)
--- KATE ---
Won't you tell me, Burrs
After seven years
Why we've never been into the sack before?
--- BURRS ---
Kate, don't bother me
--- KATE ---
I've just asking why:
--- BURRS ---
When we met you were less than a dirty whore.
--- KATE ---
Yes, but that was before I got smart
Now my whoring has turned into art.
--- BURRS ---
Maybe true, but I'll be the judge of that.
--- KATE ---
Let's forget it and tear up the carpet mat.
--- Unknown ---
(They dance. Burrs leaves her to break up Queenie and Black.
Kate pushes ahead of him.)
--- Unknown ---
KATE (to Black)
Do you think I could have this dance?
Queenie, darling, we've hardly talked
Black, why don't you go get a drink?
Wink, wink, I know what you're thinking.
--- Unknown ---
We girls need just a quiet pause
Burrs, I'll join you in just a mo',
Look, they're starting to juggernaut
Let's join in
