------ Tell Me Something ------
--- QUEENIE ---
I know nothing about you
Where you live
Where you're from
What you do
Where you go.
--- Unknown ---
Tell me something about you
Why you're here
What you want
Who you know
(spoken) Who are you?
--- BLACK ---
I live uptown
I live alone
I came from Chicago two months ago.
I work at a club
Hold the door
Nothing more
--- Unknown ---
Then I met Kate
And I met you
And what I wanted when I entered
Shouldn't be a big surprise
--- Unknown ---
I wanted change
I wanted something to excite me
Wanted change
I wanted someone who would need me
--- Unknown ---
Wanted softness and seduction
Passion and attention
Someone to believe in.
--- Unknown ---
Then I looked into your eyes
Your heavenly eyes
And I knew
Wishes can come true
Now I believe in you.
--- QUEENIE ---
Out of the blue
Out of the blue
You came and saved me
When I was running blind
--- Unknown ---
I was a fool
I was afraid
And when I met you
I had other plans in mind.
--- Unknown ---
But now, I hear it
Now I feel it
I feel it flowing inside me
Something growing inside me
Pushing me to it
Tell me
--- QUEENIE & ALL ---
Do it!
--- QUEENIE ---
Can this be what I've waited for?
Can this be what I've heard?
Something stirring is being said
But without a single word.
--- Unknown ---
This is what I was born to do
So there's nothing to fear
Touch me now.
