Gentlemen:

You are looking at a woman who invented ‘The Walk’.
You know ‘The Walk.’

These legs were built to drive men mad-
would you like to dance’
But first-

I’ll move with you
I hear your taking talent
Talent I do. I do
I’ve headlined with the best
I can still pack them in
You need help moving uptown!

When you look around the room- look’
Tell me what do you see
Imitations of imitations
I invented myself!
I’m a creature who sacrificed love for her art
Why, you may ask
With these smoldering lips:
Do you know what it’s like to kiss
such smoldering lips’
--- Unknown ---
Would you like to find out’
--- But first ---
I hear you’re movin’ uptown
Let’s go, you lead
I’m ready for the big times
That’s what I need, I need
I need to return to the place
Where I used to belong
I hear you’re moving uptown
