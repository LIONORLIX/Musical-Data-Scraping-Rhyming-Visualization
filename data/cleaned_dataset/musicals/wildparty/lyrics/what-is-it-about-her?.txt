------ What Is It About Her? ------
--- BURRS ---
What is it about her
That makes me want her?
What is it about her
That turns me pale?
Something in her smile
Something that I'll never understand
Her wild abandon.
--- BURRS QUEENIE ---
What is it about her
I know it's wrong
That parts the waters?
I know he's rough
What is it about her
That hoists the sail?
I don't know what to do
But we've been through enough
--- BURRS ---
Something in her hair
Instructing where to touch
Why do I need her so much?
--- Unknown ---
This woman makes me cry
This woman makes me burn
This woman's eye can cut me to the core
--- Unknown ---
The hatred that I see
Has been reserved for me
Yet I want more
And more
And more
--- Unknown ---
And what is it about her
--- BURRS QUEENIE ---
Oooh...
That pulls me closer?
That way he's always there
What is it about her
That tips the scale?
His strange and silent stare.
--- BURRS ---
This girl is all I have
So soft so fair, so fine
And she's forever mine.
--- Unknown ---
This woman builds me up
This woman tears me down
This woman speaks and I can break apart
--- Unknown ---
Now comes another man
Pretending he can win her heart
Well, let him start.
--- Unknown ---
What is it about her
So slight, so secret?
Something in the way she catches light
--- BURRS QUEENIE ---
Who's wrong?
Who's right?
I've never known.
Should I hold my own
Now -
Or be alone
We fall
Tonight?
We fight.
What is it about her
What is it about him?
That jumbles feelings inside?
So coarse, so queer
What is it about her
What is it about him...
That mixes passion with pride?
That holds me here?
--- BURRS ---
Could I live without her
And let her go?
--- Unknown ---
How loud must I scream
