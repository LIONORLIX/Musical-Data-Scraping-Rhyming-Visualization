------ Look At Me Now ------
--- KATE ---
Prohibition!
They can shove it.
Revolution!
Rise above it.
My solution:
Time to covet
Love it before it's too late.
--- MAX ---
Who's that?
--- ENSEMBLE ---
That's Kate!
--- KATE ---
I was born in a ditch in West Virginia
Ran away from home at ten
Crawled right out of that ditch
And holy cow
Just take a look at me now
I've been learning a trade
I've slung the hash
For more than just a couple men
I've been pillowed and paid
For Wah-Wah-Wow
But won't you look at me now!
--- Unknown ---
Look at me now
Taking a bow
I've been to Hell and back
Look at me now
Happy and how
I met a swell named Mr. Black.
--- BLACK ---
Sorry, Kate, I had to pay for the hack.
--- KATE ---
Welcome back.
--- BLACK ---
Are you all right?
--- KATE ---
Me? Give me a bottle of bourbon and half a chicken
And I'll conquer the world!
I got life in me yet
So let me tell you
The south is gonna rise again
When you start in a ditch
You quickly learn to plow
So, darling, darling, darlings,
Take a damn good look
