------ This Is What It Is ------
--- Unknown ---
Queenie
The stars are gone
Slipped outta sight
I oughta follow them
Into the night.
--- Unknown ---
But here is good
Feels almost right
Don’t call it love, yet
Just call it:
Light.
--- Unknown ---
This is what it is
To wake up, yeah
This is what it is
To feel warm, yeah
This is what it is
To be filled, sure
This is what it is
To be lost ‘ Help
This is what it is
--- Unknown ---
To be scared ‘ God
This is what it is ‘
This is what it is ‘
To know the day
And meet the sun
And find that i am not
The only one
I am not
The only one
Who’s afraid of a world too big
And bright
--- Unknown ---
This is what it is
To live in’
