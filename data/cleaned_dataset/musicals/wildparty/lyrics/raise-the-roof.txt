Ya ya!

Brrrrrrrrrrr! Ooh!
Lock the door and stop complaining
Gather 'round and listen well
From now on we're entertaining
How to hotten up this hell.
--- Unknown ---
Hold your mood and hold your bladder
Skip the food and stop the chatter
Can't you hear the pitter-patter?
We're not here to eat.
We came for the heat!
--- Unknown ---
Let's raise the roof
Let's make a scene
Let's hop the gods of love
Will shine above
And show the way.
Let's call the shots
Let's roll the dice
Take my advice
It always pays to
Raise the roof!
--- Unknown ---
Crush the ice and shake forever
Tell the evening where to go
If you need a new endeavor
I can teach you what I know
--- Unknown ---
Grab your partner by the collar
Bribe the barman with a dollar
Just ignite a mighty holler
Lead me to the trough
Till the clock goes off!
--- QUEENIE ENSEMBLE ---
Let's raise the roof
Let's raise the roof
Let's make a scene
Let's make a scene
Let's hop the gods of love
Will shine above Ooohhh...
And show the way.
Let's raise the roof!
Let's call the shots
Let's call the shots
Let's roll the dice
Let's roll the dice
--- QUEENIE ---
Take my advice
It always pays to
Raise the roof!
--- Unknown ---
Let the neighbors scream and shout
Who cares if they do?
--- Unknown ---
If they can't see the light
We'll keep them up all night
--- ENSEMBLE ---
All right!
All right!
--- QUEENIE ---
Sooooo:.
Cut the strings and set the table
Gather roses on your way
Welcome to our Tower of Babel
Learn the language, come what may.
--- Unknown ---
Spare me how the wind is blowing
When you keep the whiskey flowing
You can reap what you've been sowing
If you walk the plank
You've got me to thank
--- QUEENIE ENSEMBLE ---
Let's raise the roof
Let's raise the roof
Let's make a scene
Let's make a scene
Let's hop the gods of love
Will shine above Ooohhh...
And show the way.
Let's raise the roof!
Let's call the shots
Let's call the shots
Let's roll the dice
Let's roll the dice
--- QUEENIE ---
The time for playing nice is done
Before the big hand hits the one
We've got to do what must be done
So put away that smoking gun
--- QUEENIE ENSEMBLE ---
And raise the roof!
Time to have some fun!
Go raise the roof!
Time to beat the sun!
Let's raise the roof!
--- QUEENIE ---
