------ I'll Be Here ------
--- BLACK ---
When you cry
I can hold you
When you fall
Shed no tear
--- Unknown ---
When you lose your light
In the naked night
I'll be here
I'll be here
--- Unknown ---
When you fail
I can soothe you
No more harm
No more fear
On the coldest climb
To the end of time
I'll be here
I'll be here
--- Unknown ---
I'll be standing by
Trying to comfort
Hoping I am enough
I'll be flying high
Crying myself into happiness
I've never known
A life I thought I'd never own.
--- Unknown ---
Maybe I've been dreaming
And this moment isn't real.
How else can I explain
This power that I feel?
--- Unknown ---
You can run
I'll forgive you
I'm the one
You can call
--- Unknown ---
I will need you
I will feed you
I will lead you to the clear
I'll be here
