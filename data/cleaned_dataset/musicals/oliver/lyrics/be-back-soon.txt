You can go,
But be back soon
You can go,
But while you're working.
This place,
I'm pacing round...
Until you're home,
...Safe and sound
--- Unknown ---
Fare thee well,
But be back soon
Who can tell
Where danger's lurking?
Do not forget this tune
Be back soon.
--- BOYS ---
--- Unknown ---
How could we forget
How could we let
Our dear old Fagin worry?
We love him so.
We'll come back home
In, oh, such a great big
Hurry
--- DODGER ---
--- Unknown ---
It's him that pays the piper.
--- BOYS ---
--- Unknown ---
It's us that pipes his tune
So long, fare thee well
Pip! Pip! Cheerio!
We'll be back soon.
--- FAGIN ---
--- Unknown ---
You can go
But be back soon
You can go,
But bring back plenty
Of pocket hankerchiefs
And you should be clever thieves.
Whip it quick,
and be back soon
There's a sixpence here for twenty
Ain't that a lovely tune?
Be back soon.
--- DODGER ---
--- Unknown ---
Our pockets'll hold
A watch of gold
That chimes upon the hour
--- BOYS ---
--- Unknown ---
A wallet fat
An old man's hat
--- DODGER ---
--- Unknown ---
The crown jewels from the tower
We know
The Bow Street Runners,
--- ALL ---
--- Unknown ---
But they don't know this tune.
So long, fare thee well.
Pip! Pip! Cheerio!
We'll be back soon.
--- FAGIN ---
--- Unknown ---
Cheerio, but be back soon.
I dunno, somehow I'll miss you
I love you, that why I
Say, Cheerio...
Not goodbye.
--- Unknown ---
Don't be gone long
Be back soon.
Give me one long,
Last look...
Bless you.
Remember our old tune...
Be back soon!
--- BOYS ---
--- Unknown ---
We must disappear,
We'll be back here,
Today...
...Perhaps tomorrow.
We'll miss you too
--- FAGIN ---
--- Unknown ---
It's sad but true
That parting is such sweet sorrow.
--- ALL ---
--- Unknown ---
And when we're in the distance
You'll hear this
Whipered tune...
So long, fare thee well
Pip! Pip! Cheerio!
We'll be back soon
--- Unknown ---
And when we're in the distance
You'll hear this
Whipered tune...
So long, fare thee well
Pip! Pip! Cheerio!
We'll be back soon

Last look...
