------ As Long as He Needs Me ------
--- NANCY ---
--- Unknown ---
As long as he needs me...
Oh, yes, he does need me...
In spite of what you see...
...I'm sure that he needs me.
--- Unknown ---
Who else would love him still
When they've been used so ill?
He knows I always will...
As long as he needs me.
--- Unknown ---
I miss him so much when he is gone,
But when he's near me
I don't let on...
--- Unknown ---
...The way I feel inside.
The love, I have to hide...
The hell! I've gone my pride
As long as he needs me.
--- Unknown ---
He doesn't say the things he should.
He acts the way he thinks he should.
But all the same,
I'll play
This game
His way.
--- Unknown ---
As long as he needs me...
I know where I must be.
I'll cling on steadfastly...
As long as he needs me.
--- Unknown ---
As long as life is long...
I'll love him right or wrong,
And somehow, I'll be strong...
As long as he needs me.
--- Unknown ---
If you are lonely
Then you will know...
--- Unknown ---
When someone needs you,
You love them so.
--- Unknown ---
I won't betray his trust...
Though people say I must.
--- Unknown ---
I've got to stay true, just
