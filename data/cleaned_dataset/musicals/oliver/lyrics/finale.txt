Food, glorious food!
Hot sausage and mustard!
While we're in the mood
Cold jelly and custard!
Pease pudding and saveloys
What next? is the question
Rich gentlemen have it boys
Indigestion!

Consider yourself at home
Consider yourself one of the family
We've taken to you so strong.
It's clear we're going to get along.
Consider yourself well in
Consider yourself part of the furniture
There isn't a lot to spare
Who cares what ever we've got we share
If it should chance to be we should see some harder days
Empty larder days.
Why grouse?
Always a chance we1ll meet somebody to foot the bill
Then the drinks are on the house.
Consider yourself our mate
We don't want to have no fuss.
For after some consideration we can state
Consider yourself one of us!

I'd do anything
For you, dear, anything
For you mean ev'rything to me.
I know that I'd go anywhere
For your smile, anywhere
For your smile ev'rywhere I'd see.
Let the clouds of grey come along
Never mind if they come along
Surely they won't stay very long
If you'll only say
You're mine alone.
I'd risk ev'rything
For this bliss ev'rything
