------ Where Is Love? ------

(spoken) Right then, Oliver Twist, your bed's underneath the counter.
You don't mind sleeping among coffins I suppose?
It don't much matter whether you do or you don't cause you
can't sleep nowhere else!

Where is love?
Does it fall from skies above?
Is it underneath the willow tree
That I've been dreaming of?
Where is she?
Who I close my eyes to see?
Will I ever know the sweet hello
That's only meant for me?
Who can say where she may hide?
Must I travel far and wide?
'Til I am bedside the someone who
I can mean something to ...
Where...?
Where is love?
--- Unknown ---
Who can say where...she may hide?
Must I travel...far and wide?
'Til I am beside...the someone who
I can mean...something to...
Where?
