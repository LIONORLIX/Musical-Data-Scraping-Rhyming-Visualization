Without any bannister
Which we'll throw him down, and feed him on
Cockrouches served in a canister

What will he do when he's turned black and blue?
He will curse the day
Somebody named him

Long overdue for a sweeping out
Which we'll push him up,
And one day next year with the rats he'll be creeping out.

For the highest bid
Glad to be rid
Of
