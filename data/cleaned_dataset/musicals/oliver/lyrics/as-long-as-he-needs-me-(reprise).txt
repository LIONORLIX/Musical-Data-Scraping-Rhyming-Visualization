------ As Long as He Needs Me (Reprise) ------
--- MR. BROWNLOW ---
--- Unknown ---
(spoken) Who is this man? Perhaps we can...
--- NANCY ---
--- Unknown ---
(spoken) No! We can't! Whatever else I do, I won't turn on him!
--- MR. BROWNLOW ---
--- Unknown ---
(spoken) But, a man who might kill you?
--- NANCY ---
--- Unknown ---
(spoken) Yeah, but he's mine, and I'm his.
I've got to go back. I want to go back.
--- Unknown ---
(Sung) He doesn't act as tho' he cares.
But deep inside I know he cares.
And that is why I'm tied
Right by his side.
--- Unknown ---
As long as he needs me...
I know where I must be
But, will he never see
That someone else needs me?
--- Unknown ---
As long as life is long...
I'll love him...right or wrong...
But, something just as strong
Says someone else needs me...
--- Unknown ---
A child
With no one to take his part.
I'll take his part, Bill...
..But cross my heart!
--- Unknown ---
I won't betray your trust
Tho' people say I must.
My heart will stay true..just..
