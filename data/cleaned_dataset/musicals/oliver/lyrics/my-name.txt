------ My Name ------
--- SIKES ---
--- Unknown ---
Strong men tremble when they hear it!
They've got cause enough to fear it!
--- Unknown ---
It's much blacker than they smear it!
Nobody mentions...
My name!
--- Unknown ---
Rich men hold their five-pound notes out --
Saves me emptying their couats out.
They know I could tear their throats out
Just to live up to...
My name!
--- Unknown ---
Wiv me
Jemmy in me hand,
Lemme see the man who dares
Stop me.
Taking what I may
He can start to say his prayers!
--- Unknown ---
Biceps like an iron girder,
Fit for doing of a murder,
If I just so much as heard a
Bloke even whisper...
(spoken) My name! Bill Sikes...
--- Unknown ---
(sung) Some Toff, slumming wiv his valet,
Bumped into me in the alley
Now is eyes'll never tally
He'd never heard of ...
My name!
--- Unknown ---
One bloke
Used to boast the claim
He could take my name in vain...
Poor bloke...
Shame 'e was so green
Never was 'e seen again!
--- Unknown ---
Once bad -- What's the good of turning?
In hell, I'll be there-a-burning
Meanwhile, thing of what I'm earning
All on account of...
My name!
--- Unknown ---
What is it? What is it? What is it?
