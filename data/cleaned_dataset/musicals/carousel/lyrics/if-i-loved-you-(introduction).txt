------ If I Loved You (Introduction) ------

Billy
Ain't you scared of me? I mean, after what that cop said about me
takin' money from girls?
--- Unknown ---
Julie
I ain't scared!
--- Unknown ---
Billy
Is that your name Julie, Julie, hmm hmm, somethin'?
--- Unknown ---
Julie
Julie Jordon-
--- Unknown ---
Billy
You're a queer one, Julie Jordan,
Ain't you sorry that you didn't run away?
You can still go if you wanna,
--- Unknown ---
Julie
I reckon that I care to choose to stay!
You couldn't take my money if I didn't have any
And I don't have a penny, that's true.
And if I did have money,
You couldn't take any
'Cause you'd ask an' I'd give it to you!
--- Unknown ---
Billy
You're a queer one, Julie Jordan,
Have you ever had a fella you give money to?
--- Unknown ---
Julie
No!
--- Unknown ---
Billy
Ain't you ever had a fella at all?
--- Unknown ---
Julie
No!
--- Unknown ---
Billy
Well, you must have a fella you went walkin' with
--- Unknown ---
Julie
Yes!
--- Unknown ---
Billy
Where'd you walk?
--- Unknown ---
Julie
Nowhere special I recall-
--- Unknown ---
Billy
In the woods?
--- Unknown ---
Julie
No!
--- Unknown ---
Billy
On a beach?
--- Unknown ---
Julie
No!
--- Unknown ---
Billy
Did you love him-
--- Unknown ---
Julie
No, I've never told you anyone, I told you that.
--- Unknown ---
Billy
Aha! You're-Your're a funny kid!
Hey, you wanna go to town dance maybe or...
--- Unknown ---
Julie
No! I have to be careful!
--- Unknown ---
Billy
Of what!
--- Unknown ---
Julie
Of my character... You see, I'm never gonna marry.
--- Unknown ---
I'm never gonna marry if I was gonna marry,
I wouldn't have to be such a stickler.
But I'm never gonna marry,
And a girl who don't marry
Has got to be much more partic'lar
--- They Laugh ---
--- Unknown ---
Billy
Ah ah ah-
Hey s'ppose- s'ppose I was to say that I would marry you, hmm?
--- Unknown ---
Julie
You!?!
--- Unknown ---
Billy
Oh, that scared you, hmm?
Then you are thinkin' 'bout what the cop said!
--- Unknown ---
Julie
No, I ain't, I never paid no mind of what he said!
--- Unknown ---
Billy
But you wouldn't marry a smear like me, would you?
--- Unknown ---
Julie
Yes, I would!
If I loved you... It wouldn't make no difference what you'd-
Even if I died for it.
--- Unknown ---
Billy
Well, how you know what you'd do if you loved me?
How you'd feel or anythin'?
--- Unknown ---
Julie
I don't know how I know. Just the same I know how it'd be...
If I loved you.
When I work in the mill weaving at the loom
I gaze absent-minded at the roof
And half the time the shuttle get tangled in the threads
And the warp get mixed with the woof
If I loved you...
--- Unknown ---
Billy
But you don't!
