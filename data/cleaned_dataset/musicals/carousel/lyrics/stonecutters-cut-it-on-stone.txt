Jigger
I've never seen it yet to fail
I'll never see it fail
A girl who's in love with a virtuous man
Is doomed to weep and wail
Stonecutters cut it on stone
Woodpeckers peck it on wood
There's nothin' so bad for a woman
As a man who thinks he's good!
--- Unknown ---
Nice talk!

My mother used to say to me
When you grow up, my son
I hope you're a bum like your father was
'Cause a good man ain't no fun!

Jigger and Men
Stonecutters cut it on stone
Woodpeckers peck it on wood
There's nothin' so bad for a woman
As a man who thinks he's good!

I've never seen it yet to fail

The clock just takes your life away
There's no relief in sight
It's cookin' an' it's scrubbin'
An' it's sewin' all day
An' God knows what in all night!
