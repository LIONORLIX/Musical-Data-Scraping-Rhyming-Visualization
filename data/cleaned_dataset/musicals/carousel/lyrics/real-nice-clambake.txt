------ Real Nice Clambake ------
--- Nettie ---
Dunno as I should've ate those last four dozen clams!
--- A girl ---
Now look here, Orin Peasley,
you just keep your hands in your own pockets if you're so cold!
--- All ---
This was a real nice clambake,
We're mighty glad we came.
The vittles we et
Were good, you bet,
The company was the same.
Our hearts are warm, our bellies are full,
And we are feeling prime.
This was a real nice clambake,
And we all had a real good time.
--- Nettie ---
Fust come codfish chowder
Cooked in iron kettles,
Onions floating on the top,
Curlin' up in pettals.
--- Julie ---
Throw'd in ribbons of salted pork,
--- Men ---
An old New England trick.
--- Julie ---
And lapped it all up with a clamshell,
Tied onto a bayberry stick.
--- All ---
Oh, this was a real nice clambake,
We're mighty glad we came.
The vittles we et
Were good, you bet,
The company was the same.
Our hearts are warm, our bellies are full,
And we are feeling prime.
This was a real nice clambake,
And we all had a real good time.

Remember when we raked them red hot lobsters
Out of the driftwood fire?
They sizzled and crackled and sputtered a song
Fittin' for an angels' choir.
--- Girls ---
Fittin' for an angels,
Fittin' for an angels,
Fittin' for an angels choir.
--- Nettie ---
We slit 'em down the back and peppered 'em good,
And doused 'em in melted butter.
--- Carrie ---
Then we tore away the claws and cracked 'em with our teeth
Cuz we weren't in the mood to putter.
--- Girls ---
Fittin' for an angels,
Fittin' for an angels,
Fittin' for an angels choir.
--- A guy ---
Then at last come the clams.
--- Guys ---
Steamed under rockweed and poppin' from their shells.
--- All ---
Just how many of 'em galloped down our gullets,
We couldn't say ourselves, oh,
--- Unknown ---
This was a real nice clambake,
We're mighty glad we came.
The vittles we et
Were good, you bet,
The company was the same.
Our hearts are warm, our bellies are full,
And we are feeling prime.
This was a real nice clambake,
And we all had a real good time.
We said it 'afore and we'll say it again,
