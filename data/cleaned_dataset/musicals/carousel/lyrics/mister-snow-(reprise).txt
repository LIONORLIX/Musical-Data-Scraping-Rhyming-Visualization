------ Mister Snow (Reprise) ------
--- Girls ---
When you walk down the isle all the heads will turn,
What a rustlin' of bonnets there'll be.
And you'll try to smile, but your cheeks will burn,
And your eyes'll get so dim you can hardly see.
--- Unknown ---
With your orange blossoms quiverin' in your hand,
And you'll stumble to the spot where the parson is,
Then your finger will be ringed with a golden band,
And you'll know the feller's yours,
And you are his.

When I marry Mister Snow,
The flowers'll be humming with the hum of bees,
The birds'll make a racket in the churchyard trees.
When I marry Mister Snow.
--- Unknown ---
Then it's off to home we'll go,
And both of us'll look a little dreamy-eyed,
A drivin' to a cottage by the oceanside
Where the salty breezes blow.
--- Unknown ---
He'll carry me across the threshold,
And I'll be as meek as a lamb.
Then he'll set me on my feet,
And I'll say kind of sweet,
Well Mister Snow, here I am!
--- Mister Snow ---
Then I'll kiss her show she'll know
That ev'rything'll be as right as right can be,
A livin' in a cottage by the sea with me
Where the salty breezes blow.
I love Miss Pipperidge,
And I aim to
Make Miss Pipperidge
Changer her name to
------ fin ------
