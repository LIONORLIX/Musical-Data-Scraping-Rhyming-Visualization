Men
Blow high, blow low,
A-whalin' we will go
We'll go a-whalin', a-sailin' away
Away we'll go
Blow me high an' low,
For many an' many a long long day.
For many an' many a long long day!

The people who live on land
Are hard to understand
When you're lookin' for fun
They clap you into jail!
So I'm shipping off to sea
Where life is gay an' free.
An' a fella can flip a hook
In the hip of a whale.

Blow high, blow low,
A-whalin' we will go
We'll go a-whalin', a-sailin' away
Away we'll go
Blow me high an' low,
For many an' many a long long day.
For many an' many a long long day!

It's wonderful just to feel
Your hands upon the wheel,
An' listen to wind a-whistlin' in the sail
But I'm climbin' off to be
The very first to see
A chrysanthemum spout come out of the snout of a whale

Blow high, blow low,
A-whalin' we will go
We'll go a-whalin', a-sailin' away
Away we'll go
Blow me high an' low,
For many an' many a long long day.
For many an' many a long long day!

A-rockin' upon the sea, your boat'll seem to be
Like a dear little baby in her bassinet.
For she hasn't leaned to walk,
An' she hasn't learned to talk,
An' her little behind is kind of inclined to be wet.
