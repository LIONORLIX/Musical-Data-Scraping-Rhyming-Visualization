------ What's the Use of Wond'rin' ------

Girls:    Tell it to her good, Julie, tell it to her good.

What's the use of wond'ring
If he's good or if he's bad,
Or if you like the way he wears his hat?
Oh, what's the use of wond'ring
If he's good or if he's bad?
He's your feller and you love him,
That's all there is to that.
--- Unknown ---
Common sense may tell you
That the ending will be sad,
And now's the time to break and run away.
But what's the use of wond'ring
If the ending will be sad?
He's your feller and you love him,
There's nothing more to say.
--- Unknown ---
Something made him the way that he is,
Whether he's false or true,
And something gave him the things that are his,
One of those things is you, so
--- Unknown ---
When he wants your kisses,
You will give them to the lad,
And anywhere he leads you, you will walk.
And anytime he needs you,
You'll go running there like mad.
You're his girl and he's your feller,
And all the rest is talk.
--- Unknown ---
Billy, Billy, where you going?
Billy:    Where we going?
Jigger:    We're going to look for the treasure.
Julie:    I don't want you to, Billy, let me come with you.
Jigger:    No!
Julie:    (feels the knife under his shirt) Billy!
Billy:    I ain't got time to fool with women tonight.  Come on, Jigger.
Julie:    Let me have that.  Oh, Billy, please!
