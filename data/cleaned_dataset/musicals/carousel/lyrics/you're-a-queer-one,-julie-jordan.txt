Carrie
Julie, Julie! Do you like him?
--- Unknown ---
Julie
I don't know.
--- Unknown ---
Carrie
Did you like it when he talked to you today,
When he put you on the carousel that way, mm mm mm
Did you like that?
--- Unknown ---
Julie
I'd rather not say.
--- Unknown ---
Carrie
You're a queer one, Julie Jordan,
You were quieter and deeper than a well
An' ye never tell me nuthin'!
--- Unknown ---
Julie
There's nuthin' that a keer to choose to tell.
--- Unknown ---
Carrie
You been acting most peculiar,
Every morning you're awake ahead of me,
Always settin' by the winder.
--- Unknown ---
Julie
I like to watch the river meet the sea.
--- Unknown ---
Carrie
When we work in the mill, weavin' at the loom
You gaze absent-minded at the roof
And half the time your shuttle gets twisted in the threads,
'Till you can't tell the warp from the woof.
--- Unknown ---
Julie
'Taint so.
--- Unknown ---
Carrie
You're a queer one, Julie Jordan,
You won't ever tell a body what you think.
You're as tight-lipped as an oyster,
And as silent as an old Sahara spink!
Julie, I've been busted to tell you something lately...
--- Unknown ---
Julie
You have?!
--- Unknown ---
Carrie
The reason I didn't care to tell you before is 'cause
you didn't have a fella of your own. Hmm hmm...
But now that you got one, I can tell you about mine!
