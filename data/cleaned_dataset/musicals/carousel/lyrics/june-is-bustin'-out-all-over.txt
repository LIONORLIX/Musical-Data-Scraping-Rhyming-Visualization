March went out like a lion
A whippin up the water in the bay
Then April cried and stepped aside,
And along come pretty little May!
May was full of promises
But she didn't keep 'em quickly enough for some
And a crowd of doubtin' Thomas's
Was predictin' that the summer'd never come
--- Unknown ---
Men
But it's comin, by gum,
We can feel it come,
You can feel it in your heart
You can see it in the ground
--- Unknown ---
Girls
You can see it in the trees
You can smell it in the breeze
--- Unknown ---
All
Look around! Look around! Look around!

June is bustin' out all over
All over the meadow and the hill!
Buds're bustin' outa bushes
And the rompin' river pushes
Ev'ry little wheel that wheels beside the mill!
--- Unknown ---
June is bustin' out all over
The feelin' is gettin' so intense,
That the young Virginia creepers
Hev been huggin' the bejeepers
Outa all the mornin' glories on the fence!
Because it's June...
--- Unknown ---
All
June, June, June
Just because it's June, June, June!

Fresh and alive and gay and young
June is a love song, sweetly song

The saplin's are bustin' out with sap!
Love hes found my brother, Junior,
And my sister's even loonier!
And my Ma is gettin' kittenish with Pap!
June in bustin' out all over

To ladies and men are payin' court.
Lotsa ships are kept at anchor
Jest because the captains hanker
Fer the comfort they ken only get in port!

June makes the bay look bright and blue,
Sails gleaming white on sunlit booms.

June is bustin' out all over
The ocean is full of Jacks and Jills,
With her little tail a-swishin
Ev'ry lady fish is wishin'
That a male would come
And grab 'er by the gills!

June is bustin' out all over!
The sheep aren't sheepish anymore!
All the rams that chase the ewe sheep are determined there'll be new sheep
And the ewe-sheep aren't even keepin' score!

All
On acounta it's June! June, June, June
Just because it's June, June, June!
