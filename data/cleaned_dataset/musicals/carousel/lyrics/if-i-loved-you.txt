------ If I Loved You ------
--- Unknown ---
Julie
But somehow I can see
Just exactly how I'd be-
--- Unknown ---
If I loved you,
Time and again I would try to say
All I'd want you to know.
If I loved you,
Words wouldn't come in an easy way
Round in circles I'd go!
Longin' to tell you,
But afraid and shy,
I'd let my golden chances pass me by!
Soon you'd leave me,
Off you would go in the mist of day,
Never, never to know how I loved you
If I loved you.
--- Unknown ---
Billy
Well, anyway, you mean you don't love me.
That's what you said, isn't it?
--- Unknown ---
Julie
Yes!
I can smell 'em, can you, ah?
The blossoms. The wind brings 'em down!
--- Unknown ---
Billy
There ain't much wind tonight... Hardly any.
You can't hear a sound, not the turn of a leaf
Nor the fall of a wave hittin' the sand.
The tide's creepin' up on the beach like a thief,
Afraid to be caught stealin' the land!
On a night like this I start to wonder
What life is all about.
--- Unknown ---
Julie
And I always say two heads are better than one to
figure it out.
--- Unknown ---
Billy
[spoken]
I don't need you, I don't need anybody helpin' me.
Well, I got it figured out for myself.
We're not important. What are we?
A couple o' specks with nothin'
Look up there...
--- sung ---
There's a hell of a lotta stars in the sky,
And the sky's so big the sea looks small,
And two little people, you and I
We don't count at all.
--- spoken ---
You're a funny kid, you know?
I don't remember meetin' a girl like you.
Hey, you're tryin' to get me to marry you?
--- Unknown ---
Julie
No!
--- Unknown ---
Billy
Then what's puttin' into my head, babe?
You're diff'rent, alright! I know what it is...
You have doped me with that little kid's face, right?
You've adjusted me!
I wonder what it'd be like...
--- Unknown ---
Julie
What?
--- Unknown ---
Billy
Nothin'.
No, I know what it'd be like.
It'd be awful! I can just see myself-
--- Unknown ---
Kinda scrawny, and pale
Picking at my food,
And love-sick like any other guy.
I'd throw away my sweater, and dress up like a dude
In a dicky and a collar and a tie.
If I loved you.
--- Unknown ---
Julie
[spoken]
But you don't!
--- Unknown ---
Billy
No, I don't!
[sung]
But somehow I can see
Just exactly how I'd be
If I loved you,
Time and again I would try to say
All I'd want you to know.
If I loved you,
Words wouldn't come in an easy way
Round in circles I'd go!
Longin' to tell you,
But afraid and shy
I'd let my golden chances pass me by!
Soon you'd leave me,
Off you would go in the mist of day,
Never, never to know
How I loved you
If I loved you.
--- spoken ---
Aha...I'm not the kinda fella to marry anybody!
No, even if a girl was foolish enough to want me to,
I wouldn't!
--- Unknown ---
Julie
Don't worry about it, Billy!
--- Unknown ---
Billy
Who's worried?
--- Unknown ---
Julie
You were right about there bein' no wind.
The blossoms are comin' down by theirselves.
