------ When Children Are Asleep ------
--- Unknown ---
Enoch
I own a little house and I sail a little boat
And the fish I catch I sell
And in a manner of speakin'
I'm doin' very well.
--- Unknown ---
I love a little girl and she's in love with me
And soon she'll be my bride.
And in a manner of speakin'
I should be satisfied.
--- Unknown ---
Carrie
Well, ain't you?
--- Unknown ---
Enoch
If I told you my plans and the things I intend
It'll make ev'ry curl on your head stand on it
--- Unknown ---
When I make enough money out of one little boat.
I'll put all of my money in another little boat.
I'll make twice as much outa two little boats,
An' the first thing you know, I'll have four little boats;
And then eight little boats, then a fleet of little boats.
Then a great big fleet of great big boats.
All catchin' herring, bringin' into shore;
Sailin' out again, an' bringin' more.
An' more, an' more, an' more!
--- Unknown ---
Carrie
Who's gonna eat all that herring?
--- Unknown ---
Enoch
[Spoken]
They ain't gonna be herring. I'm gonna put 'em in cans
an' call 'em sardines. Aha... Gonna build a little sardine
cannery. Then a big one, then the biggest one in the whole
country. Oh, Carry, I'm gonna get rich on sardines. Ah!
I mean, we're gonna get rich. You an' me an' all of us...
--- Sung ---
The first year we're married,
We'll have one little kid.
The second year we're goin'
Have another little kid.
You'll soon be darnin' socks
For eight little feet-
--- Unknown ---
Carrie
I am not enough to another fleet!
--- Unknown ---
Enoch
We'll build a lot more rooms,
Our dear little house will get bigger,
Our dear little house will get bigger-
--- Unknown ---
Carrie
An' so will my figure!
--- Unknown ---
Enoch
[Spoken]
Oh Carrie, can you imagine how it'll be when all the little
kids are upstairs in their beds, and you and me sit alone
by the firelight. Me in my armchair, and you on my knee-
--- Unknown ---
Carrie
Maybe...Maybe...
--- Unknown ---
Enoch
[Sung]
When the children are asleep we sit and dream,
The things that every other dad and mother dream.
When the children are asleep and lights are low,
If I still love you the way I love you today,
You'll pardon my sayin', I told you so...
When the children are asleep, I'll dream with you
We'll think what fun we have had and be glad
That it's all came true
--- Unknown ---
Carrie
When the children are asleep we sit and dream,
--- Unknown ---
Enoch
Dream all alone...
--- Unknown ---
Carrie
The things that every other dad and mother dream
--- Unknown ---
Enoch
Dreams that won't be interrupted...
When the children are asleep and lights are low
--- Unknown ---
Carrie
Hold and behold... If I still love you
The way I love you today,
You'll pardon my sayin', I told you so...
When the children are asleep, I'll dream with you
--- Unknown ---
Enoch
You'll dream with me...
--- Unknown ---
Carrie
We'll think what fun we have had and be glad
That it's all came true!
--- Unknown ---
Enoch
When today is a long time ago...
--- Unknown ---
Both
You'll still hear me say
That the best dream I know is you
--- Unknown ---
Carrie
When the children are asleep I dream with you!
