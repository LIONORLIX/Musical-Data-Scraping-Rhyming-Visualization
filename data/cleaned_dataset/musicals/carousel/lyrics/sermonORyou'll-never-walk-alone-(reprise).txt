Dr. Seldon
[Spoken]
The world belongs to you as much as to the next fella.
Don't give it up, an' try not to be scared of people not
liking you, just try likin' them. Just keep your faith an'
courage an' you'll come out right. It's-It's like what
we used to sing ev'ry mornin' when I went to school, maybe
it's still the same, I don't know...

When you walk through a storm

Company
Keep your chin up high
And don't be afraid of the dark.
At he end of the storm
Is a golden sky
And the sweet silver song of a lark.
--- Unknown ---
Walk on through the wind,
Walk on through the rain,
Tho' your dreams be tossed and blown.
--- Unknown ---
Walk on, walk on
With hope in your heart
And you'll never walk alone,
