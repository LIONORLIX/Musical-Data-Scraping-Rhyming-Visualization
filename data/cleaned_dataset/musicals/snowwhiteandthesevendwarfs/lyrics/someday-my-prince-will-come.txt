------ Someday My Prince Will Come ------
--- Unknown ---
Some day my prince will come
Some day I'll find my love
And how thrilling that moment will be
When the prince of my dreams comes to me
--- Unknown ---
He'll whisper "I love you"
And steal a kiss or two
Though he's far away
I'll find my love some day
Some day when my dreams come true
--- Unknown ---
Some day I'll find my love
Someone to call my own
And I'll know him the moment we meet
For my heart will start skipping a beat
Some day we'll say I do
Things we've been longing to
Though he's far away I'll find my love some day
Some day when my dreams come true.
--- Unknown ---
Somewhere waiting for me
There is someone I'm longing to see
Someone I simply can't help but adore
Someone who'll thrill me forever
--- Unknown ---
Someday my prince will come
Someday I will find the one
Though he's far away
He'll find my love someday
Someday when my dreams come true
