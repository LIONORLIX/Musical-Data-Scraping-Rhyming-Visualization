------ You're Never Too Old To Be Young ------
--- Yodel ---
Yodel-ay-ee-hoo (etc.)
Chorus
You're never too old to be young
You're never too old to be young
When you start to lose your figure
And your hips are gettin' bigger
Your chest may slip
But don't you fret
No matter how weak your knees may get
Though your teeth are out
And your whiskers sprout
And your arches give away
You're never too old to be young and gay
When ya ain't got any fuzz upon your dome
When ya ain't got any fuzz upon your dome
Why the dickens should you care
If you ain't got any hair
'Cuz you never have to use a brush and comb
When you know your legs are gonna give out soon
When you know your legs are gonna give out soon
When your joints begin to squeak
If you practice for a week
You can walk around and play yourself a tune
Your voice may crack when you try to sing
But you can't be good at everything
