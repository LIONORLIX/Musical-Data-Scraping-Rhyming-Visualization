------ I'm Wishing/One Song ------
--- Unknown ---
Make a wish into the well
That's all you have to do
And if you hear it echoing
Your wish will soon come true
--- Unknown ---
I'm wishing (I'm wishing) for the one I love
To find me (to find me) today
I'm hoping (I'm hoping)
And I'm dreaming of
The nice things (the nice things) he'll say (he'll say)
--- Unknown ---
Ha ha ha ha ha (ha ha ha ha ha)
Ha ha ha ha ha (ha ha ha ha ha)
Ha ha ha ha ha (ha ha ha ha ha)
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
--- Unknown ---
I'm wishing (I'm wishing) for the one I love
To find me (to find me) today
Prince: Today!

One Song
I have but one song
One song
Only for you
One heart
Tenderly beating
Ever entreating
Constant and true
One love
That has possessed me
One love
Thrilling me through
One song
My heart keeps singing
Of one love
