------ One Small Girl ------
--- STORYTELLERS ---
One small girl
In a tree
Torn from her mother
Crying in fright
One small girl
Tossed by sea
And left to face
The stormy night
Once small girl
Holding tight
--- Unknown ---
STORYTELLERS(Spoken in rhythm)
At last the storm subsided.
And the morning sun glowed.
And two old peasants
came cautiously
down the road.
--- TONTON JULIAN ---
Mama Euralie!
--- MAMA EURALIE ---
Tonton Julian!
--- Unknown ---
MAMA(spoken)
Asaka is smiling again, Julian.
--- TONTON ---
This morning she smiles. Last night  she tried
to blow our heads off.
--- MAMA ---
Ah, Julian, just listen to those birds.
--- BIRDS ---
Coo coo coo coo coo
Coo coo coo coo coo
--- LITTLE TI MOUNE ---
Aaaahh!
--- TONTON ---
What kind of bird is that?
--- MAMA ---
Look! There!
--- MAMA ---
One small face
Two small knees
--- TONTON ---
Why are you up there?
--- MAMA ---
What is your name?
--- MAMA ---
The girl can't speak
--- Unknown ---
TONTON(Gesturing up)
And they're to blame
Agwe probably meant to kill her
--- Unknown ---
MAMA(spoken in rhythm)
The she'd be dead
--- TONTON ---
It's possible he forgot
--- MAMA ---
The god's don't forget
--- TONTON ---
Then they had some reason to spare
Her life
--- BOTH ---
It's best that we don't know what
One small girl...
Better not.
--- Unknown ---
TONTON(spoken)
But we are too old for children
--- MAMA ---
We have no room, and no food...
--- ERZULIE ---
And not knowing why, they followed
their hearts back to the tree, gently lifted
the terrified child down...
--- LITTLE TI MOUNE ---
Noo!!!
--- ERZULIE ---
And discovered that she could speak after all.

--- WOMEN ---
In the way
--- MAMA ---
Constantly hungry
--- TONTON ---
Learning too quick
--- Unknown ---
ALL(but little Ti Moune)
One small girl
Hard at play
--- TONTON ---
She makes me smile
--- MAMA ---
She scares me sick!
--- ERZULIE ---
And they scolded and teased
And held her
And mended the clothes she tore
--- Unknown ---
ALL(but Mama, Tonton and Little Ti Moune)
And the hut was crowded
And food was scarce
And somehow, their lives held more
One small girl
To live for.
--- A STORYTELLER ---
They named her Desiree Dieu-Donne or
God-Given Desire. But in their affection, they
simply called her Ti Moune.
--- LITTLE TI MOUNE ---
What does Ti Moune mean, Mama?
--- MAMA ---
It means little orphan. Saved by the gods for
something special!
--- LITTLE TI MOUNE ---
What is it?
--- MAMA ---
Ti Moune, if we knew why the gods did the
things they do, we would be gods ourselves!
--- LITTLE TI MOUNE ---
Someday I'm going to ask them, Mama!
--- Unknown ---
ALL(but Mama, Tonton and Little Ti Moune)
Sweet as a eucalyptus
And terrible as a tempest
Banging a drun
And humming a tune...
Ti Moune
Falling
And running
And calling
And growing
And growing
And growing
And growing...up too soon...
--- TONTON ---
One small girl
--- MAMA ---
Not so small
--- TONTON ---
Lost in those daydreams
--- MAMA ---
Day after day
--- STROYTELLERS ---
Ooh way ooh
--- TONTON ---
Call her name
--- MAMA ---
No, don't call
--- Unknown ---
Ooh way ooh
--- BOTH ---
Her ears
Don't hear
She's far away
--- TONTON ---
And I know that
She's getting older
--- MAMA ---
I know that it's
Meant to be
--- BOTH ---
And my arms
Can't hold her
And keep her small
But all that my
Heart can see...
--- Unknown ---
Aaahhh
