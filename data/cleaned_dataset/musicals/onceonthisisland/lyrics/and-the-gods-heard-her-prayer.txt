------ And the Gods Heard Her Prayer ------
--- A STORYTELLER ---
And the gods heard her prayer.
--- ASAKA (Spoken) ---
The peasant girl wants a grand homme to carry
carry her away!
[sung]
I should...
Find a tree all covered with mangos
Juicy mangos, fat and well-fed
Pick a mango
--- AGWE ---
A juicy mango
--- ERZULIE ---
A lovely mango
--- PAPA GE ---
A poison mango
--- ASAKA ---
Drop the mango...
--- ALL ---
BOOM!
--- ASAKA ---
And knock some sense in her head!
--- ALL GODS ---
Knock some sense in her head!
--- AGWE ---
Splash her with a wave!
--- PAPA GE ---
Scare her half to death!
--- ERZULIE ---
Give her what she wants?
--- ASAKA, AGWE, PAPA GE ---
Give her what she...?
--- ERZULIE ---
give her what she wants
--- Unknown ---
Love has many powers
If the love is true
--- Unknown ---
It can cross the earth [To Asaka]
And withstand the storm [To Agwe]
It can conquer even you [To Papa Ge]
--- PAPA GE (Spoken) ---
Hah! Love conquer death? Why, I could stop
her heart like that!
--- ERZULIE (Spoken) ---
Stop her heart from beating, yes. But not
from loving. Not if love is what she chooses.
--- PAPA GE ---
Ridiculous!
--- AGWE ---
Interesting!
--- ASAKA ---
More amusing than mangos!
--- ALL ---
A journey!
--- ERZULIE ---
I will give her strength
When the time is right
--- ASAKA ---
I will guide her way
--- PAPA GE ---
I will make her choose!
--- AGWE ---
And I'll provide the place
Where two different worlds
will meet Tonight.
