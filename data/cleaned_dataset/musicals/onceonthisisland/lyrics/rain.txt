------ Rain ------
--- AGWE ---
Let there be no moon
Let the clouds race by
Where the road meets the sea
Let the tide be high
--- Unknown ---
Let there be a girl
Walking by the sea
And let there be... Rain!
--- ALL/AGWE & STORYTELLERS ---
Rain!
--- AGWE ---
Listen to her prayers
Full of hope and pain
As she stares down the road
In the pouring rain
--- Unknown ---
Rain on the road
Rain on her face
Rain makes the road such
A dangerous place...
--- AGWE ---
Let there be
A car
Racing through
The night
Where the road
Meets the sea
Let her wait!
Where the road
Meets the sea
Let him spin!
Where the road
Meets the sea
Let their fate
Begin... in...
The rain...
--- STORYTELLERS ---
Let there be
A car
Racing through
The night
Where the road
Meets the sea
--- Unknown ---
Where the road
Meets the sea
--- Unknown ---
Where the road
Meets the sea
--- Unknown ---
Rain...
Rain...
--- ALL (But Ti Moune & Daniel) ---
Rain!!!
--- TI MOUNE (Spoken) ---
Help! Someone come quickly!
A car has crashed!
Hello? Can you hear me?
--- WOMAN ---
His skin is so pale, she thinks
--- TI MOUNE ---
Can you see me?
--- MAN  ---
His eyes open for a moment
--- ALL WOMEN ---
Eyes from another world
--- STROYTELLERS ---
Gray as the sky
--- TI MOUNE ---
Oh gods, oh gods,
You saved my life for a reason
