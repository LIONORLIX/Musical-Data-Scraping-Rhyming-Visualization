------ Forever Yours ------
--- TI MOUNE ---
Sure as a wave
Needs to be near the shore
You are the one
I was intended for
Deep in your eyes
I saw the god's design
Now my life is forever yours
And you are mine
--- Unknown ---
I am a tree
Holding away the storm
Here in my arms
I'll keep you safe and warm
Even the gods
Won't dare to cross this line
Where my life is forever yours
--- TI MOUNE ---
And you are mine
[DANIEL]
And you are mine
--- BOTH ---
Mine...
We'll race away in a car
As silver as the moon
And the storn will turn to sun
On an island where the earth and sea
Are one...
--- Unknown ---
Sure as the night
Leasds to a sky of blue
Sure as my heart
Leads me to be with you
Surely the gods
Meant this to be
A sign
That my life is
Forever yours
And you are mine
--- PAPA GE ---
Mine!
--- PAPA GE ---
Mine!
Arrogant fool
Think you can hold back death!
--- TI MOUNE ---
Stay Away!
--- PAPA GE ---
This boy is mine
I am his dying breath
--- TI MOUNE ---
I won't let you have him!
--- PAPA GE ---
Sure as the grave
You must accept what is
Now his life is forever mine...
--- TI MOUNE ---
Take mine for his!
--- PAPA GE ---
What?
--- TI MOUNE ---
Take my life...
My soul... for his
--- PAPA GE ---
I am the road
Leading to
No return
--- TI MOUNE ---
I would die for him!
--- PAPA GE ---
Secret of life
Nobody wants to
Learn
I am the car
Racing toward
Distant shores
--- TI MOUNE ---
Now his life is forever mine...
--- PAPA GE ---
Your life is forever mine...
--- TI MOUNE ---
And I am yours
