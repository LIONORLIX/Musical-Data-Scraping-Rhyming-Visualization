Now what can he want
With a woman like her?
Blacker than coal and low as dirt
He could have the world
But takes a peasant!
Perhaps his brain was hurt!
Look how she holds him
And touches and attends him
The believes
She can make him well
--- ALL ---
And she has him in a spell.
--- DANIEL ---
You are my charm. Without you, I could never
be whole again.
--- TI MOUNE ---
I will never leave you, Daniel.

GOSSIPERS (Solos)
Now, what do you make
Of a peasant like her?
Putting on airs without a doubt
When the boy is well
And does not need her
--- ALL ---
How soon he'll throw her out.
--- DANIEL ---
Soon, I'll be dancing!
--- TI MOUNE ---
But for now, walk slowly, Daniel.
--- DANIEL ---
The you must wlak even more slowly,
Ti Moune.
--- TI MOUNE ---
Why?
--- DANIEL ---
So that I can catch you!
--- FATHER ---
Daniel!
--- DANIEL ---
Papa.
--- FATHER ---

You'll be playing this game?
--- DANIEL ---
This is no game.
--- FATHER ---
Surely you can't believe it's real?
--- DANIEL ---
I'm in love with Ti Moune!
--- FATHER ---
You are not the first
To want a peasant
I, too, know their appeal
But you are my son
You'll do what must be done
No matter what you feel
--- GOSSIPER ---
I know what he sees
In a peasant like her
--- GOSSIPER ---
Probably makes him rise like yeast
--- TWO PEOPLE ---
Well, the girl may think
She's very clever
--- FOUR PEOPLE ---
The boy may keep her here forever
--- ALL ---
But I can tell you this: They'll never
