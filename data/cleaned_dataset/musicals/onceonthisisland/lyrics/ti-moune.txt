------ Ti Moune ------
--- MAMA ---
What can I say to stop you now
Now that you've heard your drums
And seen your dancers
Now that you think your heart has
All the answers...
--- Unknown ---
Who knows how high
Those mountains climb
Who knows how deep
Those rivers flow
Who knows how wrong
A dream can go
Ti Moune
--- TONTON ---
I won't be there to guide your way
--- MAMA ---
To braid your hair or dry your tears
--- BOTH ---
As we have done these many years
Ti Moune
Ti Moune
--- TONTON ---
What you are, we made you
What we gave, you took
Now you run without
One backward look
--- MAMA ---
You'll find some other boy to save
Some other life that you can share
Your heart is young
New dreams are everywhere
Choose your dreams with care
Ti Moune
--- TI MOUNE (Spoken) ---
But I have chosen, Mama, I'm not a child
any longer.
--- Unknown ---
What I am, you made me
What you gave, I owe
But, if I look back, I'll never go
--- Unknown ---
Who knows how high
Those mountains climb
--- MAMA, TONTON ---
Who knows how high
Those mountains climb
--- TI MOUNE ---
Who knows how deep
Those rivers flow
--- MAMA, TONTON ---
Who knows how deep
Those rivers flow
--- TI MOUNE ---
I know he's there
That's all I need to know...
--- TONTON ---
Go and find your love
--- MAMA ---
Go and swim the sea
--- BOTH ---
You know where we'll be
--- TI MOUNE ---
Always there with me...
--- ALL THREE ---
Ti Moune
