------ If The World Should End ------
--- Unknown ---
Don't think about tomorrow
We've only got today
There's nothing that I want from you
Not a word you have to say
You are all I need
And all I can defend
All I need to hold on to
If the world should end
--- Unknown ---
In my imagination
I could not have made this up
In a world stranger than fiction
Ours is no fictional love
I can see the you
Under your second skin
I can feel your hear beat quicken
Quicken and then slow
There's nothing else I need to know
And there's nothing you need to pretend
If the world should end
--- Unknown ---
And the sky tonight is luminous
For all the wrong reasons
And every doorway is hiding something
And if this world should all
Come crashing down
I wouldn't care at all
--- Unknown ---
And if there's no tomorrow
I'll have today again
There's no time for sorrow
When there's no such thing as time
And if the darkness will descend
Don't need a savior or a friend
I can say I've really loved
