(Spoken)

I am the queen of dreams
Banished to a shadow prison
But I've watched and waited
As your powers have risen
And now my lonlieness can be undone
For the fates had delievered you my one
With me alone you have nothing to hide
Confide in me
Inside of me the universe awaits
Unwind
we'll eclipse this mortal mind
The gift you've been given binds you to me
With spider silk threads
