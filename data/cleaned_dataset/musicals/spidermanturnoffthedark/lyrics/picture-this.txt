Picture this
Open the iris, open it up wide
The world changes shape
With the colour of your eyes
--- Unknown ---
Picture this
You are already where you wanna be
Now close your eyes
What does it look like
--- Unknown ---
Picture this
The world is spinning on a tiny pin
Nobody knows the danger we're in
--- Unknown ---
On this sunny day
Let your imagination run away
On this sunny day
Sunny days
See the future through the haze
--- Unknown ---
Picture this
I wanna believe you and I'm gonna try
But I find it hard to see me
Through your eyes
--- Unknown ---
Picture us
Realize this is a dizzy high
And we could fall and fall and fall and fall
--- Unknown ---
On this sunny day
Let your imagination run away
On this sunny day
Sunny days
See the future through the haze
--- Unknown ---
Love, is this love
--- Unknown ---
Just crimes, peace wars, true lies. I can see a noble shame. I can see a living death. I can see a healing pain, a pure decay, a
helping hurt, a freeing jail.

On this sunny day
On this sunny day
On this sunny day
Hate, war, hurt, shame, death, pain
Hate, war, hurt, shame, death, pain
On this sunny day
Hate, war, hurt, shame, death, pain
Hate, war, hurt, shame, death, pain
Hate, war, hurt, shame, death, pain
