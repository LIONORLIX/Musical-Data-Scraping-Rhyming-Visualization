------ Rise Above 2 ------
--- Unknown ---
When the ones who run the firehouse are the ones who start the fire
And the lawyers make the laws
And every preacher is a liar
And the ones that damn the innocent
While they own the nightly news
And front page
An old man said to me
Its not who but what you love
And knowledge isn't wisdom with our control
But still to be the changes that you want to see
They come slow
I know
--- Unknown ---
And you said rise above
Open your eyes up
And you said rise above
But I can't
I can't
--- Unknown ---
For every heart that bleeds
Will color your world red
And the sorrow in the night
Will be the blue you cannot shed
But your strength will be a vision
Beyond visibility
And the gift you have within
Will give you new eyes to see
--- Unknown ---
And you can rise above
Swing through the skies above
And you shall rise above
Yourself
--- Unknown ---
Know that I'll be watching
Know that I'll waiting
Standing on the precipice
I can't soar away from this
--- Unknown ---
And you can rise above
Open your eyes up
And you can rise above
Yourself
--- Unknown ---
And you can rise above
Open your eyes up
And you can rise above
Yourself
--- Unknown ---
And you can rise above
Open your eyes to love
And you can rise above
Yourself
--- Unknown ---
And every heart that bleeds
Will color your world red
And the sorrow in the night
Will be the blue you cannot shed
And your strength will be a vision
Beyond visibility
And the gift you have before you
