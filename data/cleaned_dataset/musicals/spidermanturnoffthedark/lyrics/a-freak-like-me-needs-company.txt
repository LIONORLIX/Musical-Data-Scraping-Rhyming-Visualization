------ A Freak Like Me Needs Company ------
--- Unknown ---
If you're looking for a night out on the town
You just found me
I'm a sixty five million dollar circus tragedy
--- Unknown ---
I'm not rolling, baby
Rolling in the green but I'm you need
A freak
--- Unknown ---
I'm the new Coney Island
And all the rides are open and free on mee
--- Unknown ---
All the weirdos in the world are here right now
In New York city
All the braves and boys and girls are dressed to kill
Without pity
--- Unknown ---
All the weirdos from out of town
And all the freaks always around
All the weirdos in the world are
Here in New York city
Here in New York city
--- Unknown ---
I got a crew of party animal mutants by my side
Demon hairdo, evil dresses, who just won't be denied
--- Unknown ---
The crossroads of the world does need a little tweak
From a freak
I said goodbye to my straight life 'cause I, I'm a freak
--- Unknown ---
All the weirdos in the world are here right now
In New York city
All the braves and boys and girls [incomprehensible]
Show no pity
--- Unknown ---
All the weirdos from out of town
And all the freaks always around
All the weirdos in the world are
Here in New York city
Here in New York city
--- Unknown ---
Oh yeah
That's the boys
And the ladies sing
