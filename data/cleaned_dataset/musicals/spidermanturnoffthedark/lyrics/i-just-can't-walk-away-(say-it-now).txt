------ I Just Can't Walk Away (Say It Now) ------
--- Unknown ---
Say it now, say it now
Explain to me
Why this happens to me every time
Give me any kind of sign
'Cause I just can't walk away
--- Unknown ---
You wait
I won't
I leave
I don't
I memorize what I have to say
But he doesn't say it anyway
--- Unknown ---
Say it now, say it now
Explain to me
Why this happens to me every time
Give me a clue or tell me why
I just can't walk away
--- Unknown ---
Walk, walk away
Walk, walk away
--- Unknown ---
Needing, aching, lying awake
In a room in my heart
A heartbeat away
Yet we're miles apart
--- Unknown ---
You know that love can't live
Without honesty
But there are dangers in the daylight
And the shadows with me
--- Unknown ---
Say it now, I wish I could say it now
Say to me the words I need to hear
Why you just don't disappear
And why I just can't walk way
--- Unknown ---
Say it now, say it now
Say to me the simple words I fear
I know why I'm here
'Cause I just can't walk away
--- Unknown ---
Walk, walk away
Walk, walk away
Walk, walk away
Walk, walk away
Walk, walk away
Walk, walk away
Walk, walk away
