(Peter)
--- Unknown ---
Don't talk
Just walk
--- Unknown ---
Going nuts
Hate my guts
--- Unknown ---
Get good grades
Another shove
--- Unknown ---
Stop being a loser
Stop being unloved
--- Unknown ---
And why do I need these stupid glasses
I'd give my life to be
--- Unknown ---
Anyone but me (yeah)
Anyone but me
--- Unknown ---
I wanna be
Anyone but me (yeah)
--- Unknown ---
(Mary Jane)
--- Unknown ---
This isn't home just a house
Broken door broken glass
--- Unknown ---
Dad'll yell
Tune him out
--- Unknown ---
He's drunk by now
He has to shout
--- Unknown ---
Keep on walking
Just ignore
--- Unknown ---
Just get to your room
And shut the door
--- Unknown ---
Let me disappear
Or just be
--- Unknown ---
Anywhere but here (yeah)
Anywhere but here
--- Unknown ---
I wanna be
--- Unknown ---
(Peter)
--- Unknown ---
Everyday it's like a war and I'm losing it
I'm taking hits from every side, every side that there is
--- Unknown ---
(Mary Jane)
--- Unknown ---
Evryday I feel the walls are closing in
When can I begin?
--- Unknown ---
To get myself right out of this place
--- Unknown ---
(Peter and Mary Jane)
--- Unknown ---
Anyone but me (I count the class as it grows)
Anywhere but here (I go to sleep in my clothes)
--- Unknown ---
The shoes don't fit
Not am not what I am told (where do I wake?)
Not am not what I've been sold (what do I take?)
--- Unknown ---
I'm at the point of possibility (Who will I find?)
I can almost answer famility (what answers fine, when is my time?)
Not am not what I've been wrong (Is it now?)
--- Unknown ---
(Peter and Mary Jane)
--- Unknown ---
And I can see an open door
And I can't live like this no more
--- Unknown ---
I can't live like this no more
I can't live like this no more
