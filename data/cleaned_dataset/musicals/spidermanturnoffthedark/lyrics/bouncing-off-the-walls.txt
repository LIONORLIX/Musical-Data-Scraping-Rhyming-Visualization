------ Bouncing Off The Walls ------
--- Unknown ---
Someone else has woken up inside of me
Something has just turned on a light in me
I feel a force flow trough every artery now
--- Unknown ---
I can't get down, I woke up one the roof again
Round and round, spinning on the spot again
I can't explain the who, the where, the why
Or the when, how
--- Unknown ---
And I feel it in my veins
It's a feeling I can't tame
Can anyone please explain
Why, why, why
--- Unknown ---
Why I'm bouncing off the walls
Bouncing off the walls
Bouncing off the walls
Bouncing off the walls
--- Unknown ---
A sun spot, I'm atomic energy
The atom split but left the best part of me
It's not static just electricity
Wow, wow, wow, wow
--- Unknown ---
Bouncing off the walls
Bouncing off the walls
Bouncing off the walls
Bouncing off the walls
--- Unknown ---
Bouncing off the walls
Bouncing off the walls
Oh
Oh
--- Unknown ---
And I feel it in my soul
What I need to control
And I feel it in my bones
Let's rock and roll
Roll, roll, roll, roll
--- Unknown ---
Bouncing off the walls
Bouncing off the walls
Bouncing off the walls
Bouncing off the walls
--- Unknown ---
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, alright
