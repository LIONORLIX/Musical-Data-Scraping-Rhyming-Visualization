------ Sinistereo ------
--- Unknown ---
Now come thoughts that you shall not banish
Secret fears, visions never to vanish
Crawling shapes now come writhing out
To cast their shadows over this human rout
--- Unknown ---
You set yourself on fire
You set yourself on fire
You set yourself on fire
--- Unknown ---
Breath of our breath with no blood or bone
Never grows weary, never grows old
Mutters and mumbles in infinite ways
Ever the tyrant to the willing slaves
--- Unknown ---
You set yourself on fire
You set yourself on fire
You set yourself on fire
--- Unknown ---
Much of madness and more of sin
No government of this vast, formless thing
--- Unknown ---
You set yourself on fire
You set yourself on fire
You set yourself on fire
