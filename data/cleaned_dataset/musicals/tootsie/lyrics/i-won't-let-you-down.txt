------ I Won't Let You Down ------
--- DOROTHY MICHAELS ---
I've always imagined that you are the flower
And I am the Dirt
My world spins around you
Whenever you fall I'm the one who gets hurt
--- Unknown ---
I give you all I have
Give me one thing in return
--- Unknown ---
Have me help you, to help me
To help you, to help me
To help you to learn
--- Unknown ---
That I won't let you down
I'll give you my heart and soul
I'll be here to play any role
You need me to play
--- Unknown ---
I won't let you down
Whatever you want me to be
You give me your trust
I give you my word
I won't let you down
--- Unknown ---
Nobody sees me, and nobody listens
And nobody cares
But you know what's in here
Love and Devotion that needs to be shared
--- Unknown ---
(spoken): Pick it up!
--- Unknown ---
I won't let you down
--- Unknown ---
(spoken): That's Good, Thank You!
--- Unknown ---
Because you believe in me
Because you're the one who can see
I'm here and alive!
--- Unknown ---
I won't let you down
Cause when I felt empty inside
You filled up my cup
You lifted me up
And I won't let you down
--- Unknown ---
(spoken): Up a whole step!
--- Unknown ---
I'll never let you down
I'll do what you need me to do
I promise I'll always come through
Just call and I'm there
--- Unknown ---
I won't let you down
Whoever you want me to be
You give me your trust
I'll give you my word
And I won't let you down
--- Unknown ---
Please make the right choice
Remember my voice
I won't let you down
--- Unknown ---
Just give it some thought
I love you a lot
I won't let you down
I won't let you down!
