------ Whaddya Do (Reprise) ------
--- JEFF SLATER ---
Whaddaya do when everything is happening
But everything that's happening
Has got you in distress
--- Unknown ---
Whaddaya do when you're future calls
So grow yourself a pair of balls
And take those balls and put them in this dress
--- Unknown ---
So your life is a joke
You think everything is ?
Well grab a roll of duct tape and some glue
--- Unknown ---
Whaddaya gonna do
You're gonna fix your hair
And go out there
And be the man and woman that you are
--- MICHAEL DORSEY ---
That's the only way to win
You gotta go all in
--- MICHAEL DORSEY & JEFF SLATER ---
Well I'm all in (You're all in)
