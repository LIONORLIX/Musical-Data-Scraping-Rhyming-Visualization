------ Gone, Gone, Gone ------
--- JULIE ---
I woke up this morning
Out of my brain
An unfamiliar feeling
Like I’m gonna go insane
Screaming like a banshee
Barking like a dog
--- Unknown ---
Like black is white
Like day is night
Like I’m walking in a total fog
--- Unknown ---
And I’m feeling like a fool
Someone’s changing all the rules
Bats in the attic
Fire in the hole
I can’t breathe, I can’t sleep, I can’t think
Baby, I’m gone, gone gone
--- Unknown ---
Bees in the bonnet
I’m gonna lose control
Baby, I’m gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
--- Unknown ---
I keep hearing voices
Don’t know if they’re mine
Brain’s on vacation
Heart is working overtime
Beatin’ like a demon
And I can’t make it stop
My mind is bruised, I’m so confused
Waiting for the other shoe to drop
--- Unknown ---
And it’s all because of you
‘Cause you’re changing all the rules
Bat in the attic
Fire in the hole (Oh)
Can’t tell exactly where I am
‘Cause baby, I’m gone, gone, gone
--- Unknown ---
Bees in the bonnet (Oooh)
I’m gonna lose control (Got no control)
Baby, I’m gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
--- Unknown ---
I’m a runaway train and I’m off the track
Ten pounds of crazy in a five pound sack
If six were nine, that’s how I feel
Three fries short of a Happy Meal
I’m back, I’m broke, I’m dizzy, I’m doped, I’m fried
I think I’m-
--- Unknown ---
Bats in the attic (She’s losing it, I tell you)
Fire in the hole (She’s cracking up)
Baby lost her rattle (Wawawawa)
Yeah, I’m gone, gone, gone
--- Unknown ---
Out of the saddle (Yippee yi yippee yi ki yay)
Out of control (She’s lost her soul)
Yeah, I’m gone, gone, gone, gone
--- Unknown ---
Bees in the bonnet (Zzz-zzz-zzz)
Bombs in the dome
Not sure I’m coming back
‘Cause baby, I’m gone, gone, gone
--- Unknown ---
Lights in the windows
When nobody’s home
Baby, I’m gone, gone, gone
Baby, I’m gone, gone, gone
Baby, I’m gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
