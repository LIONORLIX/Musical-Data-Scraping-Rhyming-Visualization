------ I Like What She's Doing ------
--- RITA MARSHALL ---
I like what she's doing
This might be a thing
She's giving it feeling
She's making it sing
She's fun but profound
Let's not shove this down
I like what she's doing
--- Unknown ---
What she's selling
I'm buying
It's something we need
I love that she's trying
Let's follow her lead
We were flat on our back
But now we're on track
She'll polish this turd
Into treasure somehow
Just maybe if Dorothy keeps doing
What she's doing now
--- Unknown ---
(spoken)
Well, we got work to do
God knows how we got this far
But ready or not
We move into the theater tomorrow
--- Unknown ---
CARL: (spoken)
Alright kiddos
It's your favorite stage manager, Carl
Break's over!
We're gonna rehearse
The new Juliet-Nurse scene
Everyone else, there is a revised
Schedule on the board
Don't forget to sign back in!
Dorothy, July, the stage is yours!
--- Unknown ---
JULIE HALSTON: (spoken)
He saw your motionless hair
And your avocado figure
And I lost the man I loved
--- Unknown ---
DOROTHY MICHAELS: (spoken)
To be fair, dear
You did kill the last one
Juliet, don't I deserve a chance
At a future that celebrates me?
--- Unknown ---
Oh, this is really good!
Are you okay with all this?
--- Unknown ---
JULIE HALSTON: (spoken)
Are you kidding?
--- Unknown ---
(sung)
I love what we're saying
I'm smiling at last
It's great how we're playing
I'm having a blast
I trust you completely
So does the whole cast
We like what you're doing
--- Unknown ---
She's got something special
That makes you engaged
--- JULIE HALSTON ---
It's almost electric
When she hits the stage
--- RITA MARSHALL ---
And I can't explain it
She's taking this turkey
And making it work
--- RITA MARSHALL & JULIE HALSTON & ? ---
And I can't tell you how
But, honey, I hope she keeps doing
What she's doing now
--- Unknown ---
DOROTHY MICHAELS: (spoken)
Rita, oh forget the renaissance
I'm thinking all new costumes
50's, feline, fabulous
--- Unknown ---
RITA MARSHALL: (spoken)
Dorothy, I love it
--- RON CARLISLE ---
She won't take directions
She's changing the play
She's like an infection
That won't go away
--- Unknown ---
She just wants to fight me
She doesn't despise me
I hate what she's doing
--- Unknown ---
It's very traumatic
I'm really upset
She's bringing up memories
I need to forget
--- Unknown ---
She's stealing my girl
She's stealing my show
And I'm ready to blow
All because of that cow
--- Unknown ---
Goddamnit!
She's gotta stop doing
What she's doing now
--- Unknown ---
MAX VAN HORN: (spoken)
Ok, Max
New clothes, New lines
You got this!
--- Unknown ---
JULIE HALSTON: (spoken)
If you take her
You better take care of her!
--- Unknown ---
MAX VAN HORN: (spoken)
I will devote my life to her happiness
I love her
--- Unknown ---
DOROTHY MICHAELS: (spoken)
Mean it!
--- Unknown ---
MAX VAN HORN: (spoken)
I will devote my life to her happiness
I love her
--- Unknown ---
DOROTHY MICHAELS: (spoken)
I don't believe it!
--- Unknown ---
MAX VAN HORN: (spoken)
I will devote my life to her happiness
I love her!
--- Unknown ---
DOROTHY MICHAELS: (spoken)
Well done max
--- Unknown ---
MAX VAN HORN: (spoken)
Hey, I like what she's doing
She's got so much heart
She's so friggin sexy
And so frickin' smart
--- Unknown ---
She's made me an actor
She's built like a tractor
I like what she's doing
--- ENSEMBLE ---
We totally need her
I love her because
She's always a leader
Whatever she does
--- Unknown ---
Something was missing
And she's what it was
I mean everyone's standing
When she takes her bows
--- Unknown ---
God, really
I hope she keeps doing
What she's doing now
--- Unknown ---
JULIE HALSTON: (spoken)
How will I live without you here?
--- Unknown ---
DOROTHY MICHAELS: (spoken)
Happily, Juliet
Departing is such sweet sorrow
--- Unknown ---
JULIE HALSTON: (spoken)
Then let's gather by the fountain
So we can all say arrivederci!
--- Unknown ---
RITA MARSHALL: (spoken)
Dorothy, You have turned this show
Into a joyous anthem for all women
So, I am officially changing the title
From Juliet's Curse to Juliet's Nurse
--- DOROTHY MICHAELS ---
I won't let you down
Because you believed in me
And now anybody can see
I'm really alive
--- Unknown ---
I'll never let you down
I'm no longer empty inside
I filled up my cup
I never gave up
--- Unknown ---
And now I can soar
To the heavens and higher
--- ENSEMBLE ---
I hope she keeps doing
What she's doing right
Removing our tears
Relieving our fears
--- Unknown ---
And when the smoke clears
We'll still have careers
--- Unknown ---
So what's not to love?
--- DOROTHY MICHAELS ---
I give you my word
I won't let you...
--- ENSEMBLE ---
I like what she's doing
--- DOROTHY MICHAELS ---
...down
--- ENSEMBLE ---
I like what she's doing
What she's doing
