--- MICHAEL DORSEY ---
Michael Dorsey the man
With the scheme
And the master plan
Couldn't beg, buy, or borrow his dream
But now Dorothy can
--- Unknown ---
'Cuz she's got me flying like a bird
So how to describe it
Only one word
Unstoppable!
--- Unknown ---
Stand aside 'cause this girl's on a roll
She's unstoppable!
Admiration, respect, and Control
She's unstoppable!
--- Unknown ---
Half-cocked and down on my knees
Doors Locked
But suddenly she's
Right there beside me
And hands me the keys
She's unstoppable!
Unstoppable!
--- Unknown ---
We got the role!
We got the gig!
We got control!
We're getting big!
We took the chance!
We took this town!
Told you before
Show me the door
I'll kick it down
--- Unknown ---
When I put on the wig
And the dress I'm unflappable
You can't start to chime
Dorothy's success
It's unmappable!
--- ENSEMBLE ---
Don't try to slow her down!
--- MICHAEL DORSEY ---
Like the thrusts a hummingbird's tongue
Like a Bearcat that's blown out its bum
Like a hippo protecting her young
Unstoppable!
--- ENSEMBLE ---
Unstoppable!
Unstoppable!
Unstoppable!
--- Unknown ---
Look out world
Cuz this girl's on a roll
She's unstoppable!
Admiration, respect, and control
She's unstoppable!
--- Unknown ---
Anywhere
Hollywood
Or Broadway
Any part
Any scene
Any play
--- Unknown ---
Nothing and no one not anything
Anyone ever can do or say can stop her
Unstoppable!
Unstoppable!
Unstoppable!
--- DOROTHY MICHAELS ---
I'll be taking the world over soon
Unstoppable!
No use trying to burst my balloon
Unpopable!
No more waiting
Cuz this is my time
There's no mountain
These hills can't climb
Nothing on earth can stop me
Cuz I'm
Unstoppable!
--- ENSEMBLE ---
Unstoppable!
Unstoppable!
