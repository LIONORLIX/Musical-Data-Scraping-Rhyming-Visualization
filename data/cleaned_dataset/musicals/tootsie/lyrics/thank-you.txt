------ Thank You ------
--- MICHAEL ---
There's you and there's me
With a heart you discovered
These hands so familiar and warm to the touch
I love you, you know that
However you want it
Thank you, thank you, thank you so much

Julie, I was a better man with you as a woman,
Than I ever was with a woman as a man
