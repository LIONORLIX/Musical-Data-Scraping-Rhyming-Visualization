------ Confide in Me ------
--- Unknown ---
I stand in the distance
I view from afar
Should I offer some assistance
Should it matter who you are
--- Unknown ---
We all get hurt by love
And we all have our cross to bear
But in the name of understanding now
Our problems should be shared
--- Unknown ---
Confide in me, confide in me
--- Unknown ---
I can keep a secret
And throw away the key
But sometimes to release it
Is to set our children free
--- Unknown ---
We all get hurt by love
And we all have our cross to bear
But in the name of understanding now
Our problems should be shared
--- Unknown ---
Confide in me, confide in me
Confide in me, confide in me
--- Unknown ---
Stick or twist the choice is yours
Hit or miss what's mine is yours
Stick or twist the choice is yours
Hit or miss what's mine is yours
--- Unknown ---
We all get hurt by love
And we all have our cross to bear
But in the name of understanding now
Our problems should be shared
--- Unknown ---
Confide in me, confide in me
Confide in me, confide in me
--- Unknown ---
Confide in me, confide in me
