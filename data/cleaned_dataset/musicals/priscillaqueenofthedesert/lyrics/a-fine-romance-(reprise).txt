------ A Fine Romance (Reprise) ------
--- Unknown ---
A fine romance with no kisses
A fine romance, my friend this is
We should be like
A couple of hot tomatoes
But you're as cold
As yesterday's mashed potatoes
--- Unknown ---
A fine romance with no clinches
A fine romance with no flinches
I've never mussed the crease
In your blue serge pants
I never get the chance
This is a fine romance
--- Unknown ---
A fine romance, my good fellow
You take romance, I'll take jello
You're just as hard to land as the Ille de France
I haven't got a chance
My heart's not made of plastic
You're the reason I'm sarcastic
