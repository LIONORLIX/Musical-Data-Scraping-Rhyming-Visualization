------ MacArthur Park ------
--- Unknown ---
Spring was never waiting for us, girl
It ran one step ahead
As we followed in the dance
--- Unknown ---
Between the parted pages and the prayers
Still love's hot, fevered iron
Like a striped pair of pants
--- Unknown ---
MacArthur's Park is melting in the dark
All the sweet, green icing flowing down
Someone left the cake out in the rain
--- Unknown ---
I don't think that I can take it
'Cause it took so long to bake it
And I'll never have that recipe again, oh noooooo
--- Unknown ---
I recall the yellow cotton dress
Foaming like a wave
On the ground around your knees
Birds like tender babies in your hands
And the old men playing checkers, by the trees
--- Unknown ---
MacArthur's Park is melting in the dark
All the sweet, green icing flowing down
Someone left the cake out in the rain
--- Unknown ---
I don't think that I can take it
'Cause it took so long to bake it
And I'll never have that recipe again, oh noooooo
--- Unknown ---
(Short instrumental interlude)
--- Unknown ---
There would be another song for me
For I will sing it
There would be another dream for me
Someone will bring it
--- Unknown ---
I will drink the wine while it is warm
And never let you catch me looking at the sun
And after all the loves of my life
After all the loves of my life, you'll still be the one
--- Unknown ---
I will take my life into my hands and I will use it
I will win the worship in their eyes and I will lose it
I will have the things that I desire
And my passion flow like rivers through the sky
--- Unknown ---
And after all the loves of my life
Oh, after all the loves of my life
I'll be thinking of you - and wondering why
--- Unknown ---
(Longer instrumental interlude)
--- Unknown ---
MacArthur's Park is melting in the dark
All the sweet, green icing flowing down
Someone left the cake out in the rain
--- Unknown ---
I don't think that I can take it
'Cause it took so long to bake it
And I'll never have that recipe again
Oh noooooo, o-oh no-ooooo
