------ I Love The Nightlife ------

Ooh I, I love the night life
I got to boogie on the disco 'round, oh yeah
Oh, I love the night life
I got to boogie on the disco 'round, oh yeah

Please don't talk about love tonight
Please don't talk about sweet love
Please don't talk about being true
And all the trouble we've been through
--- Unknown ---
Ah, please don't talk about all of the plans
We had for fixin' this broken romance
I want to go where the people dance
I want some action, I want to live, action, I got so much to give
I want to give it, I want to get some too
--- Unknown ---
Ooh I, I love the night life
I got to boogie on the disco 'round, oh yeah
Oh, I love the night life
I got to boogie on the disco 'round, oh yeah

Please don't talk about love tonight
Your sweet talking won't make it right
Love and lies just bring me down
When you've got women all over town
--- Unknown ---
You can love them all and when you're through
Maybe that'll make, huh, a man out of you
I got to go where the people dance
I want some action, I want to live, action, I got so much to give
I want to give it, I want to get some too
--- Unknown ---
Oh I, I love the night life
I got to boogie on the disco 'round, oh yeah
Oh, I love the night life
I got to boogie on the disco 'round, oh yeah

Oh, I love the night life
I got to boogie on the disco 'round, oh yeah
Oh, I love the night life
