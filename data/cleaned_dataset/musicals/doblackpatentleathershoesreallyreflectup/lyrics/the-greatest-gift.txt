------ The Greatest Gift ------
--- Sister helen & kids ---
It`s a good thing to be pure
It`s a good thing to be innocent
--- Sister helen ---
It`s the good lord`s way
And if you don`t stray
You`ll be happy every day

Faith`s a great gift to be sure
It`s a great gift and it`s heaven-sent
It`s the way through life
He gave us to follow
It grants peace every way

So we must all keep his word

And we must all live our lives his way
It`s the lord`s way
To guide us, to keep us
In his hands each day
