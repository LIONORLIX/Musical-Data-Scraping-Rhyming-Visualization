------ Thank God ------
--- Unknown ---
Sometimes I reflect on what might have been
If only I knew then what I know now
But the rules of the game, they have always been the same
We're no wiser than our string of years allow
--- Unknown ---
Thank God I will never be that young again
I will never feel so foolish
Wishing I were grown up, never owning up to innocence
Thank God it's a song that won't be sung again
--- Unknown ---
Yet the feelings, they come tumbling and remind me of my youth
Back when kids believed in magic every time they lost a tooth
When right and wrong were black and white and parents told the truth
A simpler time
--- Unknown ---
Thank God that our school days can be left behind
All the cruelties forgotten
Misdirection, misconceptions, fables of a dozen years
Thank God we can smile when they are brought to mind
--- Unknown ---
For the memories all amuse me now that used to just annoy
I was slowly growing wiser, it was torture mixed with joy
With respect and understanding for the man inside the boy
A special time
--- Unknown ---
Sometimes looking back it's like yesterday
And all our growing up comes into view
Though the days went so fast, in my heart they'll always last
From now on I'll share these memories with you
--- Unknown ---
Thank God we can reminisce without regret
We can linger on the good things
Hope and faith still hold
We've learned that love will make it all unfold
Thank God these are things we won't forget
It's a song that must be sung
And we'll never be that young
