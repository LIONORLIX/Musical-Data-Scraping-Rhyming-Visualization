------ What A Woman Wants ------
--- Unknown ---
Stand back, let me tell you something
What a woman wants to see
Stand back, Mr. I-Know-Everything
But it's what you blindly see
--- Unknown ---
What a woman wants
Masculinity
Sensitivity
In a fantasy
What a woman wants
A muffin to clutch
--- Unknown ---
Just a tender touch
You don't get out too much
To know the smoothness of her skin with a gentle caress
Feel the feathery quality of her dress
What separates a man like you from a man like me
--- Unknown ---
I'm a reflection,
Her protection
I'm her curious mystery
What a woman
What a woman wants
What woman wants
What woman
What a woman
What a woman wants
--- Unknown ---
C'mon we all know what a bird really wants is a rock solid
Mmhmm
--- COMMITMENT ---
Look at me, devilishly debonair
Look at you divinely dull, drab and dumpy
A woman wants a man to give as much as she can take
Just like me
A libidinous Lothario on the make
Oh piss off
--- SPOKEN ---
Oh I have a challenge for you.
Write down what you think
I need to do to be a real man and
I'll do the same for you.
Whatever you tell me to do
I will have to do.
But you will have to do the same for me.
Deal?
--- Unknown ---
I ain't wearing no poufy dress.
Chickening out already?
--- REPEATS ---
What a woman wants
What a woman wants
What a woman wants
What a woman
What a woman
What a woman wants is me
What a woman wants
What a woman wants
