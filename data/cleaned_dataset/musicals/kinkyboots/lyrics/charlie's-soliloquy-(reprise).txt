------ Charlie's Soliloquy (Reprise) ------
--- Charlie ---
Who was I kidding
This scheme was skidding
My fractured attempt at
Taking control.
--- Unknown ---
I tried in vain, now
I'm to blame
Now I'm left with a
Deep dark hole.
--- Unknown ---
So confident
So collected and so cool
Hey, look at me now
