In this corner lean and brown
Weighing in in a gold lama gown.

In the cradle of a bright white light
Hit him in his big mouth Hit him in his insecurities.

Breathing heavy like a butter milk cake
Can a real man ever confess
He was beaten by a guy in a dress
Oh hit him in the lipstick
Hit him in the wind beneath his feet.
