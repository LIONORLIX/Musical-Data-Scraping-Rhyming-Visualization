------ Dividing Day ------
--- Margaret ---
Dashing as the day we met,
Only there is something I don't recognize.
Though I cannot name it yet, I know it.
--- Unknown ---
Beautiful is what you are,
Only somehow wearing a frightening disguise.
I can see the winter in your eyes, love, telling me:
--- Unknown ---
“Thank you, We're done here, Not much to say.
We are together but I have had Dividing Day.”
--- Unknown ---
So when, when was this day?
Was it on the church step?
Suddenly you're out of love.
Does it go creeping slowly?
When was your Dividing Day?
--- I can see the winter in your eyes, love, telling me ---
--- Unknown ---
“Margaret, we didn't, You courtesed, I bowed.
We are together, but no more love, no more love allowed.”
--- Unknown ---
When was dividing day?
Was it on the church step?
Did it happen right away?
Were you lying next to me,
Hiding what you couldn't say?
How could I have guessed?
Was my cheek upon your chest?
An ocean away…
--- Unknown ---
When was, when was, when was Dividing Day?
