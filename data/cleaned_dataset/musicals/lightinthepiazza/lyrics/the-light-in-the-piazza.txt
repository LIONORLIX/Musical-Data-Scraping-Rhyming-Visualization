------ The Light in the Piazza ------
--- Unknown ---
I don't see a miracle shining from the sky
I'm no good at statues and stories
I try
--- Unknown ---
That's not what I think about
That's not what I see
I know what the sunlight can be
--- Unknown ---
The Light, the Light in the Piazza
--- Unknown ---
Tiny sweet
And then it grows
And then it fills the air
Who knows what you call it?
I don't care
Out of somewhere I have something I have never had
And sad is happy
That's all I see
--- Unknown ---
The Light in the Piazza
The Light in the Piazza
--- Unknown ---
It's rushing up
It's pouring out
It's flying through the air
All through the air
Who knows what you call it?
But it's there
It is there
--- Unknown ---
All I see is
All I want is tearing from inside
I see it
Now I see it everywhere
It's everywhere
It's everything and everywhere
