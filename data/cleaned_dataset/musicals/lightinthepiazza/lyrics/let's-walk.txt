------ Let's Walk ------
--- Signor ---
--- Unknown ---
I look at him and that was me
The blindness and the energy
I want to say
Here, come this way
--- Margaret ---
--- Unknown ---
When we are at a certain age
We almost fall on purpose
Fall with all our might
And then it is alright
But what do I know
Of the road to be taken for happiness
--- Signor ---
--- Unknown ---
Let's walk
--- Margaret ---
--- Unknown ---
Let's walk
--- Signor ---
--- Unknown ---
Let's walk
--- Margaret ---
--- Unknown ---
Let's walk
--- Signor ---
--- Unknown ---
Let's walk
--- Margaret ---
--- Unknown ---
Let's see
--- Both ---
--- Unknown ---
The rest will be
Ah...
And after that
We might as well walk
--- Margaret ---
--- Unknown ---
When I was younger I was she
The innocence the fantasy
But it's okay
That goes away
--- Signor ---
--- Unknown ---
That's how I was the way they are
The way they love to worry so
All through the night
When everything's alright
--- Both ---
--- Unknown ---
But what can we say
The are made of tomorrow and yesterday
--- Unknown ---
Let's walk
Let's walk
It's true
Let's see
Let's walk beyond our vanity
--- Unknown ---
No one knows
We only guess
Just a leap for happiness
For happiness
Happiness
--- Signor ---
--- Unknown ---
You never know
We might as well walk
--- Margaret ---
--- Unknown ---
We might as well walk
We might as well
--- Both ---
