--- Priest ---
Et quatenus masculinum et feminam sese mutuo complent
--- Clara ---
Et quatenum masculinus
--- Priest ---
No. Et quatenus masculinum.
--- Clara ---
Et quatenus masculinum
--- Priest ---
Si! Bene.
Ecco.
--- Clara/Priest ---
Et quatenus masculinum
Et femininam sese mutuo complent
Unitas duorum
--- Signora ---
You can almost hear what everyone's feeling
--- Signor/Franca ---
The shock of winter
Or coming on of spring
New spring
--- Franca ---
Suspended summer nights
The inner flights
That only fall can bring
--- Signor/Signora/Franca ---
I am suddenly alive
I would sail across the world
For just the color of your eyes
--- Fabrizio/Franca/Singor/Singora ---
You appear, appear to me
Unam carnem
Vir et mulier
Simul creati, creati
Voliti sunt a deo ut alliis pro alio
--- Clara/Priest ---
Aliis pro alio
--- Priest ---
Alliis, alliis!
--- Clara ---
Olly olly oxen free!
--- Margaret ---
The reappearing
Every now and then
--- Priest ---
Che ha detto?
--- Clara ---
Sorry
--- Clara/Priest ---
Os ex ossibus meis
Et caro de carne mea
--- Fabrizio/Franca/Signor/Signora/Margaret/Clara ---
And then
The diving underneath
The diving down
And surfacing again
--- Signora/Franca ---
I am suddenly alone
--- Signor/Signora/Franca ---
Hmm...
--- Clara/Priest ---
Vitam humanam
--- Signora/Signor/Margaret/Fabrizio/Franca/Giuseppe ---
I would sail across the world
To know the harbor of your arms
--- Clara/Priest ---
Non est bonum esse hominem solum
--- All ---
You appear
Appear to me
--- Clara ---
Mulier quam deus excosta efformat
De viro sublata quamque
Ipse ad virum adduxit
Admirationis ex parte viri provocat clamorem
Amoris et communionis exclamationem
Hey!
--- Unknown ---
(Franca kisses Fabrizio on the lips provocatively, to infuriate Giuseppe. Clara sees)
--- Clara ---
You stop!
You stop right now!
You move! You move away from him!
Oh, I see you stealing
--- Margaret ---
Darling, you
--- Clara ---
You! You're a theif!
You're a rotten theif!
You want to steal him away from me!
--- Margaret ---
Franca's merely
--- Clara ---
You stand over there!
--- Margaret ---
He's her brother
--- Clara ---
He is mine! He'll always be mine!
--- Margaret ---
Clara, you mustn't speak to Franca that way, she's family now!
--- Clara ---
No!
I will!
She can't!
He's mine!
You're not in charge of me!
Why? Because I say so!
--- Margaret ---
Please don't
--- Clara ---
No!
You saw!
And I know you saw
Her kiss him like he kisses me!
Go ahead and stare!
Jesus this is so unfair!
--- Fabrizio ---
She's joking
--- Clara ---
Joking? I'm not joking!
You love me
You love me
Why were you just sitting
Sitting there!
--- Unknown ---
Now. Here is your husband
Here is your wife
You should be standing side by side
Don't you have a house?
Where are your babies?
There's a way to behave
There's a nice way to behave
It's what nice people do and that's how it should be
That's how people meet and fall in love and how it should be
Forever
You go near him one more time
You're dead!
--- All ---
Ah...
Ah...
Ah...
--- Unknown ---
The shock of winter
The coming on of spring
That melting air
The sun gone red
An empty bed
A scent, a sound, a gesture triggering
I am suddenly alive
I am suddenly alone
Knowing I will be alone till I can be alone with you
That is what you do
You appear, you appear
