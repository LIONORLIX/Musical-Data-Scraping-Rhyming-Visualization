------ Say It Somehow ------
--- Clara ---
Why don't you trace it on my hand
Or make a song
Do anything
--- Unknown ---
Say it somehow
I will understand
I know you
--- Unknown ---
You are good
--- Fabrizio ---
There's something inside you
This I know
It's like a melody
Like there you go just now
--- Unknown ---
Say it somehow
Somehow you can show me
--- Both ---
Say it somehow
Anyway you can
You know me
You are good
Oh, you are good
You are good to me
--- Unknown ---
I know this sound
Oh, touch me (? Of..?)
I think I hear
The sound of love
Your arms around me
--- Unknown ---
Ah
--- Unknown ---
Shout and dance
With means (?)
--- Clara ---
Or say it silently
--- Fabrizio ---
Tell me things
--- Both ---
Oh
--- Unknown ---
We'll play a game (again?)
You'll trace it on my skin
Do it anyway
But let's begin
Do it somehow
Somehow you can show me
I know that you know me
--- Unknown ---
Ah
--- Clara ---
Will you marry me?
--- Fabrizio ---
No, no, no
No, no, no, no
It must be mine to ask it
--- Clara ---
Ask it then!
--- Fabrizio ---
I wish to be the one to decide!
--- Clara ---
Decide, decide!
--- Fabrizio ---
Will you--
--- Clara ---
Yes!
--- Fabrizio ---
Will you marry me?
--- Clara ---
Yes! Yes!
--- Both ---
You are good to me
I know this sound
Oh, touch me (? Of..?)
--- Unknown ---
I think I hear the sound of love
Your arms around me
--- Unknown ---
Ah
--- Unknown ---
Tell me things
--- Unknown ---
Ohh
