------ Fable ------
--- Unknown ---
You can look in the forest
For a secret field
For a golden arrow
For a prince to appear
For a fable of love that will last forever
--- Unknown ---
You can look in the ruins
For a wishing well
For a magic apple
For a charioteer
For a fable of love that will carry you
--- Unknown ---
To a moon on a hill
To a hidden stream
A lagoon and a red horizon dream
Silhouette set away from time forever
--- Unknown ---
To a valley beyond the setting sun
Where waters shine and horses run
Where there's a man who looks for you
--- Unknown ---
But while you look you are changing, turning
You're a well of wishes
You're a fallen apple
--- Unknown ---
No!
No!
Love's a fake
Love's a fable
--- Unknown ---
Just a painting
On a ceiling
Just a children's fairy tale
Still you have to look
And look (x8)
--- Unknown ---
For the eyes
On a bridge in a pouring rain
Not the eyes but the part you can't explain
For the arms you could fall into forever
--- Unknown ---
For the joy that you thought you'd never know
For here at last away you go
To a man who looks for you
--- Unknown ---
If you find in the world
In the wide, wide world
That someone sees
That someone knows you
Love
Love
Love if you can, Oh, my Clara
Love if you can
And be loved
--- Unknown ---
May it last forever
--- Unknown ---
Clara
