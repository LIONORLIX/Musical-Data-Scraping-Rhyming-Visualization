------ Let's Build A Snowman! ------
--- Unknown ---
Sometimes, the world is black.
And tears run from your eyes.
And maybe we'll all get really sick.
And maybe we'll all die.
So...
--- Unknown ---
Let's build a snowman!
We can make him our best friend.
We can name him Tom or we can name him George!
We can make him tall, or we can make him not so tall.
Snowman!
--- Unknown ---
He'll have a happy face, a happy smile, a happy point of view.
If you build me a snowman, then I'll build one for you.

So, let's build a snowman!
We can make him our best friend.
We can name him Bob or we can name him Beowulf!
We can make him tall, or we can make him not so tall.
Snowman!

Hey!

He'll have a happy face, a happy smile, a happy point of view.
If you build me a snowman, then I'll build one for you.
