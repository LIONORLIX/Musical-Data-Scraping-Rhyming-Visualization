------ That's All I'm Asking For! ------
--- Unknown ---
[Noon] I know that there's more to life than women.
I just can't seem to figure out what else there is.
I don't need it every night, every morning would be just fine.
A little sex, that's all I'm askin' for.
That's all I'm askin' for!
--- Unknown ---
[Miners] That's all he's askin' for!
--- Unknown ---
[Noon] Something I can test, a gal would suit me best.
I got a thing to use, I know what to use it for.
A girl I can love, and kiss, and hold, and fu...
That's all I'm askin' for!
--- Unknown ---
[Bell] Now I don't wanna be rich for the sake of women.
I wanna be rich for the sake of our lord.
Enough to build a church where everyone can come.
Enough for the lord, that's all I'm askin' for.
That's all I'm askin' for!
--- Unknown ---
[Miners] That's all he's askin' for!
--- Unknown ---
[Humphrey] It ain't a lot to ask.
I'm sure we'll get it fast.
A friend of mine was mining and he made a lot of cash.
He made a gazillion dollars, how is that!
That's all I'm askin' for!
--- Unknown ---
[Miller (intervenes shouting)] He did not make a gazillion dollars!
[Humphrey] You wanna ask him?! I'll tell you where he lives!
--- Unknown ---
[Miners] That's all he's askin' for.
[Humphrey] That's all I'm askin' for.

[Swan] We're tired of being sick.
We're sick of being poor.
We've had a little luck,
Now we want a little more.
--- Unknown ---
[Miners] Enough so we'd never do anything anymore.
That's all we're askin' for!
--- Unknown ---
[Swan] Hey, what about you Mr. Miller, what are you askin' for?
[Miller] No, no, I don't sing.
[Bell] Aw come on, if you can talk, you can sing.
--- Unknown ---
[Miller] I just wanna make enough so I can open up a shop of my own and go on with my family trade.
[Bell] Well there, that's great. What is it you do?
[Miller] I'm a butcher.
[Noon] You're a butcher?!
[Miller] Yeah.
--- Unknown ---
[Packer] I've never had much in the way of friends or fam'ly.
My horse is the only pal I've ever known.
I'd like to build a ranch in the Rocky Mountain air.
A home for us, that's all I'm askin' for!
--- Unknown ---
[Miners] That's all we're askin' for! That's all we're askin' for!
We're tired of being sick. We're sick of being poor.
We've had a little luck, now we want a little more.
[Noon] A girl I can love!
[Bell] A church!
[Packer] A ranch!
[Miller] A store.
[Miners] That's all we're askin', that's all we're askin', that's all we're askin' for!
