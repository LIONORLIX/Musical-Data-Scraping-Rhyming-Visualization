------ This Side Of Me ------
--- Unknown ---
What is this magic I feel?
Seems no matter where I am, it finds me.
Puts the memories of hope inside me.
Makes me warm once more.

He's just a quiet man,
But his eyes can see right through me.
Is it only that I feel pity?
Could it be something more?
--- Unknown ---
Safe as an island,
Far off to sea.
I'd almost forgotten
This side of me.
--- Unknown ---
What is this magic I feel?
Thought this mushy stuff was below me.
Could it be he is the one to show me
What compassion is for?
--- Unknown ---
Safe as an island,
Far off to sea.
I'd almost forgotten
This side of me.
Perhaps I'm not the cold bitch
I pretended to be.
