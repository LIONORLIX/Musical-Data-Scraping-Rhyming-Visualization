------ Dangerous Game / Facade (Reprise 3) ------
--- Unknown ---
Dangerous Game
--- LUCY ---
I feel your fingers -
Cold on my shoulder -
Your chilling touch,
As it runs down my spine -
Watching your eyes
As they invade my soul -
Forbidden pleasures
I'm afraid to make mine.
--- Unknown ---
At the touch of your hand -
At the sound of your voice -
At the moment your eyes meet mine -
I am out of my mind -
I am out of control -
Full of feelings I can't define!
--- HYDE ---
It's a sin with a name -
--- LUCY ---
Like a hand in a flame -
--- HYDE ---
And our senses proclaim
--- HYDE/LUCY ---
It's a dangerous game!
--- HYDE ---
A darker dream -
That has no ending -
That's so unreal
You believe that it's true!
A dance of death -
Out of a mystery tale -
The frightened princess
Doesn't know what to do!
Will the ghosts go away? -
--- LUCY ---
No -
--- HYDE ---
Will she will them to stay? -
--- LUCY ---
No -
--- HYDE ---
Either way, there's no way to win!
--- LUCY ---
All I know is' I'm lost -
And I'm counting the cost -
My emotions are in a spin!
I don't know who to blame...
--- HYDE ---
It's a crime and a shame!
--- LUCY ---
but it's true all the same
--- HYDE/LUCY ---
It's a dangerous game!
--- Unknown ---
No one speaks -
Not one word -
But what words are in our eyes
Silence speaks -
Loud and clear -
--- Unknown ---
All the words we (don't) want to hear!
--- Unknown ---
At the touch of your hand -
At the sound of your voice -
At the moment your eyes meet mine -
--- Unknown ---
I am losing my mind -
I am losing control -
Fighting feelings I can't define!
--- LUCY ---
It's a sin with a name -
--- HYDE ---
No remorse and no shame -
Fire, fury and flame -
--- LUCY ---
Cos the devil's to blame
--- HYDE/LUCY ---
And the angels proclaim
It's a dangerous game!
--- Unknown ---
Facade (Reprise 3)
--- THE SPIDER WITH ENSEMBLE ---
If you live around here,
Lotsa people, I fear,
Will make promises
They will not honour, my dear,
An' the truth is,
You end up getting scarred!
--- Unknown ---
There's a beast at the door,
An' he's wild an' he's free,
But we don't let him in,
'Cause we don't want to see
what is lurking
