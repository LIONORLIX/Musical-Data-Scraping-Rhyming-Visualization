------ The Way Back ------
--- JEKYLL ---
Somehow I have to get back
To the place where my journey started,
Find the course I charted,
When I first departed!
--- Unknown ---
Somehow I have to hang on
To the vision that first inspired me,
To the hope that fired me,
When the world admired me!
--- Unknown ---
I'll find a way back to the higher ground,
And see the view I saw before!
I'll search the world
Until the answer's found -
Turn my despair around
Forevermore!
--- Unknown ---
Somehow I've got to rebuild
All the dreams that the winds have scattered,
From what fate has shattered -
I'll retrieve what mattered!
--- Unknown ---
Somehow I've got to go on,
Till the evil has been defeated -
Till my works completed -
I will not be cheated!
--- Unknown ---
God, you must help me carry on!
When it seems all hopes has gone,
