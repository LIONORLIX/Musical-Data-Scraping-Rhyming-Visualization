------ No One Knows Who I Am ------
--- LUCY ---
Look at me,
And tell me who I am.
Why I am
What I am.
--- Unknown ---
Call me a fool,
And it's true I am.
I don't know
Who I am.
--- Unknown ---
It's such a shame,
I'm such a sham.
No one knows
Who I am.
--- Unknown ---
Am I the face of the future?
Am I the face of the past?
Am I the one who must finish last?
--- Unknown ---
Look at me,
And tell me who I am,
Why I am
What I am.
--- Unknown ---
Will I survive?
Who will give a damn,
If no one knows
Who I am?
--- Unknown ---
Nobody knows -
Not even you -
