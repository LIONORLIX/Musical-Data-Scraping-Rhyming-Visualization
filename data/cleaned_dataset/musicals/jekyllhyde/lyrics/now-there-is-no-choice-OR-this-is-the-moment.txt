------ Now There Is No Choice / This Is The Moment ------

Now There Is No Choice
--- JEKYLL ---
Now there is no choice:
I must put aside
The fears I feel inside...
There's no place to hide!
--- So it comes to this ---
One great golden chance
That only I can take,
When everything I fought for
Is at stake!...
To make the mark
That only I can make!
--- Unknown ---
This Is The Moment
--- JEKYLL ---
This is the moment!
This is the day,
When I send all my doubts and demons
On their way!
--- Unknown ---
Every endeavor,
I have made - ever -
Is coming into play,
Is here and now - today!
--- Unknown ---
This is the moment,
This is the time,
When the momentum and the moment
Are in rhyme!
--- Unknown ---
Give me this moment -
This precious chance -
I'll gather up my past
And make some sense at last!
--- Unknown ---
This is the moment,
When all I've done -
All the dreaming,
Scheming and screaming,
Become one!
--- Unknown ---
This is the day -
See it sparkle and shine,
When all I've lived for
Becomes mine!
--- Unknown ---
For all these years,
I've faced the world alone,
And now the time has come
To prove to them
I've made it on my own!
--- Unknown ---
This is the moment -
My final test -
Destiny beckoned,
I never reckoned,
Second Best!
--- Unknown ---
I won't look down,
I must not fall!
This is the moment,
The sweetest moment of them all!
--- Unknown ---
This is the moment!
Damn all the odds!
This day, or never,
I'll sit forever
With the gods!
--- Unknown ---
When I look back,
I will always recall,
Moment for moment,
This was the moment,
The greatest moment
