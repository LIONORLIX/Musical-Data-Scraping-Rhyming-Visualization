------ Lost In The Darkness ------
--- JEKYLL ---
Lost in the darkness,
Silence surrounds you.
Once there was morning,
Now endless night.
--- Unknown ---
If I could reach you,
I'd guide you and teach you
To walk from the darkness
Back into the light.
--- Unknown ---
Deep in your silence,
Please try to hear me;
I'll keep you near me
Till night passes by.
--- Unknown ---
I will find the answer.
I'll never desert you
I promise you this
