------ The Engagement Party ------
--- SIR DANVERS ---
My dear Simon,
You're so gracious
To wish Lisa and Henry both well!
--- STRIDE ---
Dear Sir Danvers
As you know, Sir
I wish Lisa the sun and the moon!
But I have to confess
That I wish Henry Jekyll in hell!
--- UTTERSON ---
Henry! At last.
What could possibly be more important than your own engagement party?
--- JEKYLL ---
John, I am close to a breakthrough discovery!
Something spectacular, something sublime!
Finally, a light in the darkness has come to me!
Now it is only a matter of time!

1ST YOUNG MAN
Henry Jekyll, you're a devil!
You have robbed us of London's most lovely girl.
--- Unknown ---
2ND YOUNG MAN
I could turn to drink when I stop to think
Lisa's marrying a doctor instead of an earl!
Poor girl!
--- STRIDE ---
Doctor Jekyll, may I be the first to wish you and your bride-to-be
Peace and prosperity?
--- JEKYLL ---
Mr. Stride, it's most civil of you to say that, as you do,
With such patent sincerity!
