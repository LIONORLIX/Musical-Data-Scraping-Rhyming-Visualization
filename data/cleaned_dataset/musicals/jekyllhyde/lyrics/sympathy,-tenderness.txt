------ Sympathy, Tenderness ------
--- LUCY ---
Sympathy, tenderness,
Warm as the Summer,
Offer me their embrace.
--- Unknown ---
Friendliness, gentleness,
Strangers to my life,
They are there in his face.
--- Unknown ---
Goodness and sweetness
And kindness
Abound in this place
--- Unknown ---
I am in love
With the things
That I see in his face -
It's a memory I know
