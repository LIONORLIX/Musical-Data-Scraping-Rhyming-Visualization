------ Someone Like You ------
--- LUCY ---
I peer through windows,
Watch life go by,
Dream of tomorrow,
And wonder why?
--- Unknown ---
The past is holding me,
Keeping life at bay,
I wander lost in yesterday,
Wanting to fly -
But scared to try.
--- Unknown ---
But if someone like you
Found someone like me,
Then suddenly
Nothing would ever be the same!
--- Unknown ---
My heart would take wing,
And I'd feel so alive -
If someone like you
Found me!
--- Unknown ---
So many secrets
I've longed to share!
All I have needed
Is someone there,
--- Unknown ---
To help me see a world
I've never seen before -
A love to open every door,
To set me free,
So I can soar!
--- Unknown ---
If someone like you
Found someone like me,
Then suddenly
Nothing would ever be the same!
--- Unknown ---
There'd be a new way to live,
A new life to love,
If someone like you
Found me!
--- Unknown ---
Oh, if someone like you
Found someone like me,
Then suddenly
Nothing would ever be the same!
--- Unknown ---
My heart would take wing,
And I'd feel so alive -
If someone like you
Loved me...
Loved me...
