------ Alive (Reprise) ------
--- HYDE ---
Animals trapped behind bars at the zoo
Need to run rampant and free!
Predators live on the prey they pursue!
This time the predator's me!
--- Unknown ---
Lust, like a raging desire,
Fills my whole soul with it's curse!
Burning with primitive fire,
Berserk and perverse!
--- Unknown ---
Tonight I'll plunder heaven blind,
Steal from all the gods!
Tonight I'll take from all mankind,
Conquer all the odds!
--- Unknown ---
And I feel I'll live on forever,
With Satan himself by my side!
And I'll show the world
That tonight and forever,
The name to remember's
The name Edward Hyde!
--- Unknown ---
What a feeling to be so alive!
I have never seen me so alive!
Such a feeling of evil inside -
That's the feeling
Of being
