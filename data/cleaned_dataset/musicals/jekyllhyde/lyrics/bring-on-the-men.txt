------ Bring On The Men ------
--- LUCY ---
There was a time - I don't know when -
I didn't have much time for men.
But this is now - and that was then -
I'm learning!
--- Unknown ---
A girl alone, all on her own
must try to have a heart of stone.
So I try not to make it known,
my yearning!
--- Unknown ---
I try to show I have no need,
I really do - I don't succeed!
--- Unknown ---
So let's bring on the men
and let the fun begin!
A little touch of sin,
why wait another minute?
Step this way!
It's time for us to play!
They say we may not pass this way again -
so let's waste no more time -
bring on the men!
--- Unknown ---
I always knew, I always said
that silk an' lace, in black an' red
will drive a man right off his head -
it's easy!
--- Unknown ---
So many men, so little time -
I want 'em all - is that a crime?
I don't know why they say that I'm
too easy!
--- Unknown ---
They make me laugh - they make me cry,
they make me sick - so God knows why
--- LUCY & THE GIRLS ---
We say bring on the men
and let the fun begin!
A little touch of sin
why wait another minute?
Step this way!
It's time for us to play!
They say we may not pass this way again,
so let's waste no more time -
bring on the men!
--- LUCY ---
They break your heart,
they steal your soul,
take you apart
and yet they somehow make you whole.
So what's their game?
I 'spose a rose by any other name,
the perfume and the prick's the same.
--- Unknown ---
I like to have a man for breakfast each day.
I'm very social and I like it that way.
By late mid-morning, I need something to munch ...
So ask over two men for lunch!
--- Unknown ---
And men are mad about my afternoon teas,
they're quite informal, I just do it to please.
Those triple sandwiches are my favourite ones.
I'm also very partial to buns!
--- Unknown ---
My healthy appetite gets strongest at night
My at-home dinners are my men-friends' delight!
When I invite the fellers over to dine,
they all come early an' we're in bed by nine!
--- ALL ---
So let's bring on the men
and let the fun begin!
A little touch of sin
why wait another minute?
Step this way!
It's time for us to play!
They say we may not pass this way again
so let's waste no more time
--- LUCY ---
Bring on the men!
--- GIRLS ---
Big men, small men,
short men, tall men -
I guess that means
almost all men!
I'm a player
Long as they are men!
