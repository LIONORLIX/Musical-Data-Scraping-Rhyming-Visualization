------ Lucy Meets Hyde ------
--- LUCY ---
I know you, don't I?
--- HYDE ---
After tonight, my little love,
You will never forget me.
I am destined to be your guardian Angel
Your guide to salvation
In this world of madness.
--- LUCY ---
So what's yer name then, sweet'eart ?
--- HYDE ---
Hyde... Edward Hyde.
A toast to the night!
A toast to romance!
To those unafraid
Of taking a chance!
--- LUCY ---
I must admit that I like yer approach!
It's one that I've not seen before!
--- HYDE ---
Why should you settle for less, dear,
When there's more!
--- Unknown ---
I am the man
Fate has decreed
Destined to be
All that you need!
I can give you everything you desire
You can give me all I need!
--- LUCY ---
Sounds like a nice bit of business
Yes, indeed!
--- HYDE ---
I am the man
Mark my words well
With whom you'll share
Heaven or hell!
--- LUCY ---
'eaven I fancy, 'as no place for me!
And I can find hell on my own!
--- HYDE ---
Like it or not,
You will never be alone!
