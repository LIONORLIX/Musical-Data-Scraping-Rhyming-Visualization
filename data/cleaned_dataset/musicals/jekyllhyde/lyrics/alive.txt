------ Alive ------
--- HYDE ---
What is this feeling
Of power and drive
I've never known?
I feel alive!
--- Unknown ---
Where does this feeling
Of power derive,
Making me know
Why I'm alive?
--- Unknown ---
Like the night, it's a secret,
Sinister dark and unknown.
I do not know what I seek,
Yet I'll seek it alone!
--- Unknown ---
I have a thirst
That I cannot deprive.
Never have I felt so alive!
--- Unknown ---
There is no battle
I couldn't survive -
Feeling like this -
Feeling alive!
--- Unknown ---
Like the moon, an enigma,
Lost and alone in the night
Damned by some heavenly stigma,
But blazing with light!
--- Unknown ---
It's the feeling of being alive!
Filled with evil, but truly alive!
It's the truth that cannot be denied!
It's the feeling of being
