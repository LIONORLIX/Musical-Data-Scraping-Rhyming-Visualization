------ In His Eyes ------
--- EMMA ---
I sit and watch the rain,
And see my tears run down the windowpane...
--- LUCY ---
I sit and watch the sky.
And I can hear it breathe a sign...
--- EMMA ---
I think of him,
How we were...
--- LUCY ---
And when I think of him,
Then I remember...
--- LUCY/EMMA ---
Remember...
--- EMMA ---
In his eyes I can see
Where my heart longs to be!
--- LUCY ---
In his eyes I see a gentle glow,
And that's where I'll be safe, I know!
--- EMMA ---
Safe in his arms, close to his heart...
--- LUCY ---
But I don't know quite where to start...
--- EMMA ---
By looking in his eyes,
Will I see beyond tomorrow?
--- LUCY ---
By looking in his eyes,
Will I see beyond the sorrow
That I feel?
--- EMMA ---
Will his eyes reveal to me
Promises or lies?
--- LUCY ---
But he can't conceal from me
The love in his eyes!
--- EMMA ---
I know their every look,
His eyes!
--- LUCY ---
They're like an open book,
His eyes!
--- LUCY/EMMA ---
But most of all the look
That hypnotized me!
--- EMMA ---
If I'm wise,
I will walk away,
And gladly...
--- LUCY ---
But, sadly,
I'm not wise,
It's hard to talk away
The mem'ries that you prize!
--- EMMA ---
Love is worth forgiving for!
--- LUCY ---
Now I realize -
--- LUCY/EMMA ---
Everything worth living for
Is there, in his eyes!
--- EMMA ---
Love is worth forgiving for!
Now I realize -
--- LUCY ---
Now I realize -
--- LUCY/EMMA ---
Everything worth living for
