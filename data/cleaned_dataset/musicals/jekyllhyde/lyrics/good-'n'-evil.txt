------ Good 'N' Evil ------
--- LUCY ---
Good and evil -
And their merits -
Men have argued through history -
As well they should!
My philosophy
Any child can see -
Good is evil -
And therefore
All evil is good
--- Unknown ---
How do you tell evil from good?
Evil does well - good not so good!
Evil's the one that is free everywhere -
Good is the one that they sell!
You must decide which is heaven -
Which is hell!
--- Unknown ---
Good maintain evil's a curse! -
But it is plain good's even worse!
Evil's the one that they tell you to shun -
Good is the one to embrace
Say that and Satan will laugh right in your face!
--- Unknown ---
The battle between good and evil
Goes back to the start -
Adam and Eve and the apple tore Eden apart!
The key thing about good 'n' evil -
Each man has to choose! -
Heaven 'n' hell
Is a helluva gamble to lose! -
But as I peruse
This world we abuse -
It's hell that we choose -
And heaven must lose!
--- Unknown ---
Evil is everywhere -
Good doesn't have a prayer!
Good is commendable -
Evil's dependable!
Evil is viable
Good's unreliable!
Good may be thankable!
Evil is bankable!
--- Unknown ---
Evil's for me - you can have good!
Doesn't suit me to be Robin Hood!
S'easier by far, from the way that things are,
To remain good 'n' evil
