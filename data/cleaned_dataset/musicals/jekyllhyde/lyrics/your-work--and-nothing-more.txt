------ Your Work- And Nothing More ------
--- UTTERSON ---
You have your work
And nothing more!
You are possessed -
What is your demon?
--- Unknown ---
You've never been
This way before -
Where is the fire
You built your dream on?
--- Unknown ---
There's something strange,
There's something wrong.
I see a change -
It's like when hope dies.
--- Unknown ---
I, who have known
You for so long,
I see the pain
In your eyes!
--- UTTERSON JEKYLL ---
There was a time Have
You lived your life, I
And no one lived Become -
The way that you did!

You had a plan, My work
You chose a wife, And nothing
You saw the world More?
As very few did!

A single word I've said!
My fear is, he's in over his head.

They say he's gone too far.
He's locked himself away
In his own world,
Pursuing the insanity -!

It is his work!

It's more than work -
He is obsessed!
The man is driven!

His work's a crime
To be forgiven!
