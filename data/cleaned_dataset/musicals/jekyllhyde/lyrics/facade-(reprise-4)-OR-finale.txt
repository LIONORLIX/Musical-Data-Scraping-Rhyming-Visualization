Facade (Reprise 4)
--- ENSEMBLE ---
there's a beast at the door
And he's wild and free!
But we don't let him in,
'Cause we don't want to see -
what is lurking right behind the fa?ade!
--- Unknown ---
Man is not one, but two!
He is evil and good!
And he walks the fine line
That he'd cross, if he could,
He's just waiting...!

Finale
--- EMMA ---
You are free now...
You're with me now...
