------ Lucy Meets Jekyll/ Heres to the Night ------
--- LUCY ---
S' not every day me friends and I
'as gents like you just droppin' by.
Before you go,
you'll know just why you came here!
--- JEKYLL ---
Of that, my dear, I've little doubt.
One only has to look about.
It's not too hard to figure out
the game here!
And yet I sense: there's more to you
--- LUCY ---
You flatter, sir, you really do!
With half a chance ...
--- JEKYLL ---
... what would you do?
--- LUCY ---
Don't ask me!
--- Unknown ---
Here's to the night! Here's to romance!
To those unafraid of taking a chance!
--- JEKYLL ---
I think I've taken enough for one day!
And I have learned to my cost
It's not the fun that it might be
once you have lost!
--- LUCY ---
Oh, what a shame! If you only knew
the games we could play, the things we could do!
Yet I can see you're not up to the chase!
But, if you're ever in need:
I am the girl, and this is the place.
Come to me!
--- JEKYLL ---
It's getting late - I have to go.
If any time - you never know -
you need a friend ...
--- LUCY ---
Doctor Henry Jekyll, 46, Harley Street ...
If any time ... you never know ...
you need a friend ...
