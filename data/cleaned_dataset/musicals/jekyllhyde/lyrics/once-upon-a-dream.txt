------ Once Upon A Dream ------
--- EMMA ---
When it's all began,
We knew there'd be a price...
--- Unknown ---
Once upon a dream,
I was lost in love's embrace.
There I found a perfect place,
Once upon a dream.
--- Unknown ---
Once there was a time,
Like no other time before,
Hope was still an open door,
Once upon a dream.
--- Unknown ---
And I was unafraid,
The dream was so exciting!
But now I see it fade...
And I am here alone!
--- Unknown ---
Once upon a dream,
You were heaven-sent to me,
Was it never meant to be?
Was it just a dream?
--- Unknown ---
Could we begin again!...
