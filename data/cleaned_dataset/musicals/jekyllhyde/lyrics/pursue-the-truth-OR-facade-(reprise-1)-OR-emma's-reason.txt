Pursue The Truth
--- JEKYLL ---
How can I pursue the truth,
When they can block each step I take?
--- UTTERSON ---
Henry, you have come too far -
Remember what you have at stake!
--- JEKYLL ---
John, I know I'm right!
I must let my vision guide me!
I'm so weary of the fight!
There's so little left inside me!
--- UTTERSON ---
If you know that you are right,
Then you've got to see it through,
You've got to see it through!
--- JEKYLL ---
Seven years ago,
I started out on this alone,
And it's alone I'll see it through
To its conclusion!
--- Unknown ---
Who are they
To judge what I am doing?
They know nothing
Of the endless possibilities I see!
It's ludicrous I'm bound by their decision!
--- UTTERSON ---
Seems vision
Is a word
They never heard!
--- JEKYLL ---
If it mattered less,
I'd treat them with derision -
It's absurd!
--- UTTERSON ---
And yet, the fact remains,
Those bastards hold the reins!

Facade (Reprise 1)
--- ENSEMBLE ---
If you live around here,
You need cash in the bank,
'Cause the houses 'round here
Are all flashy and swank,
An' the front bit
Is what's called a facade!
--- Unknown ---
If you live around here,
You need lots of panache!
If you live in town, dear,
Then you must cut a dash!
'Tisn't hard, dear,
To create a facade!
--- Unknown ---
Here tonight it's festive -
But the guests are getting restive -
'Cause the guest of honour's
Causing a dilemma!
--- Unknown ---
Doctor Jekyll Tardy
For his own engagement party -
His betrothal
To sir Danvers' daughter, Emma!
--- Unknown ---
Emma's Reason
--- STRIDE ---
Emma Carew,
Can this be you?
What kind of man
Is this you've taken?
--- Unknown ---
Can you not see
The kind of life
That this would be?
You are mistaken!
Time to awaken,
Before it's too late,
Before you forever
Determine your fate!
--- EMMA ---
But, Simon, you knew
I had to be free.
What I choose to do
Is decided by me!
--- Unknown ---
From the day my mother died,
My father , full of good intentions,
Treated me as though I were a young child.
Maybe his idea was just to wait
Until I grew up,
And then look at me
And hope that I'd be her.
--- Unknown ---
It's easy to accept that
From a father
He'd rather
Things remained the way they were.
But when it comes to marriage,
I must pick whom I prefer!
I am not the weak young thing
You're seeking, Simon,
Someone seventeen, obedient and sweet.
I am not the prot?g?e
To waste your time on.
I'm complete -
In Henry's eyes I see
