------ Wrapped ------
--- Unknown ---
I keep every tear like an ocean
For every day that my fortune
Kept me from being with you
I cradle your faith that reveals me
Grows like a flower then heals me
Fills me with promise anew
--- Unknown ---
I carry your worn disillusion
When my pathetic confusion
Kept me from speaking the truth
I'm simply a coin in your fountain
Lost like the seconds I'm counting
Till I am closer to you
--- Unknown ---
I cherish every morning that found us
With the night scattered around us
faded and painting me blue
I carry your joy in my footsteps
Making my way to your harbor
Don't need to go any farther
You are my sun and my moon
--- Unknown ---
Wrapped in your arms where it's a peaceful
Back in your arms where I'm happy
I would do anything gladly
Only to see you again
--- Unknown ---
Wrapped in your arms I can wander
Out to the heavens above me
Hearing you say that you love me
Back in your arms where I'm free
--- Unknown ---
I keep every phrase barely spoken
That from your lips may have broken free
As you give me your love
My yearing in constant and steady
When I'm with you I'm already
Everything I can become
--- Unknown ---
I cherish every morning that found us
With the night scattered around us
faded and painting me blue
I carry your joy in my footsteps
Making my way to your harbor
Don't need to go any farther
You are my sun and my moon
--- Unknown ---
Wrapped in your arms where it's a peaceful
Back in your arms where I'm happy
I would do anything gladly
Only to see you again
--- Unknown ---
Wrapped in your arms I can wander
Out to the heavens above me
Hearing you say that you love me
Back in your arms where I'm free
--- Unknown ---
Wrapped in your arms where it's a peaceful
Back in your arms where I'm happy
I would do anything gladly
Only to see you again
--- Unknown ---
Wrapped in your arms I can wander
Out to the heavens above me
Hearing you say that you love me
