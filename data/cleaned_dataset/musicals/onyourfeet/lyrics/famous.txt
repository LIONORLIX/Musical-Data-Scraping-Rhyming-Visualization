What in this world, feels so alive
Makes us then breaks us
Then helps us survive
Buries our hopes, then revives
Our desire to succeed
We're all greed
--- Unknown ---
Who in this world, see's when i cry
Throws me then shows me
That i'm justified
Measure my worth then decide
That i'm not what they need
They've agreed
--- Unknown ---
Where in this world can i hide
Where can i find
Someone that see's me inside
To confide
--- Unknown ---
How in this world, can i go on
Wondering if you'll think
Of me when i'm gone
Shielding my eyes from
The pityless light of the glare
Should you care
--- Unknown ---
When in this world is it enough
I never thought
It could be quite this rough
Living my life as if
Millions of people don't stare
They're not there
--- Unknown ---
Why should i have to defend
Or derive
Most of the rules of the game,
I've defied
Though it's been hard on my pride
It's been one hell of a ride
Curiously..
I didn't set out to be..
