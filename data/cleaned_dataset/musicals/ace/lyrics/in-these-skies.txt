------ In These Skies ------
--- Unknown ---
There's a bang, then a rumble
Then the engine starts and it stumbles
One more tug
Now she?s going
There?s a strong propeller wind blowing
And she spits
And she sputters
As I check the tail and the rudders
And she jumps
Like she?s proving
Like she just can?t wait to get moving now
Down the field
Gaining speed
Pull her up
There she goes
There she goes
Oh
--- Unknown ---
All my life
There?s been one desire
Just to fly like the birds I see
With these wings I am climbing higher
In these skies I am free
--- Unknown ---
There?s a shick, then a rattle
I can tell she?s ready for battle
With a roar
It?s like thunder
How she even flies is a wonder
Made of wood and of wire
With a chance of catching on fire
All the risks are worth taking
As she leaves the crowd and I?m breaking free
Oh
--- Unknown ---
Look above
Not a road to guide me
Thorough these clouds
I am free to roam
With this thrill
And this joy inside me
In these skies I am home
--- Unknown ---
Now I see these folks below me
And I wonder if they know
Just like being there
They?re showing me
Just how far a simple man like me can go
--- Unknown ---
All my life
There?s been one desire
Just to fly like the birds I see
With these wings I am climbing higher
In these skies I am free
Oh
--- Unknown ---
In these skies
I have found my calling
More complete than a man should be
Let me rise without fear of falling
In these skies
In these skies
In these skies
I am free
I am free
I am free
