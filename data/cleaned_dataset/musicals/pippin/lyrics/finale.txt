Rivers belong where they can ramble
Eagles belong where they can fly

I'm not a river or a giant bird
That soars to the sea
And if I'm never tied to anything
I'll never be free
--- Unknown ---
I wanted magic shows and miracles
Mirages to touch
I wanted such a little thing from life
I wanted so much
I never came close, my love
We never came near
It never was there
I think it was here
--- Unknown ---
They showed me crimson, gold and lavender
A shining parade
But there's no color I can have on earth
That won't finally fade
When I wanted worlds to paint
And costumes to wear
I think it was here
'Cause it never was there
--- Unknown ---
I wanted magic shows and miracles
Mirages to touch
I wanted such a little thing from life
