------ With You ------
--- PIPPIN ---
My days are brighter than morning air
Evergreen pine and autumn blue
But all my days are twice as fair
If I could share
My days with you
--- Unknown ---
My nights are warmer than firecoals
Incense and stars and smoke bamboo
But nights were warm beyond compare
If I could share
My nights with you
--- Unknown ---
To dance in my dreams
To shine when I need the sun
With you
To hold me when dreams are done
--- Unknown ---
And oh....
My dearest love
If you will take my love
Then all my dreams are truly begun
--- Unknown ---
And time weaves ribbons of memory
To sweeten life when youth is through
But I would need no memories there
If I could share
My life with you
