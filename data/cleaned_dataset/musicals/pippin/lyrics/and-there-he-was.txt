------ And There He Was ------
--- CATHERINE ---
There he was
He didn't know where he was
And he looked so lost and exhausted
You'd almost swear he was dead
So I said:
Pick him up, put him to bed
See that he's bathed and clothed and fed
As I said, how could I foretell
He'd clean up, oh, so very well
Imagine my surprise
When I raised my eyes
And there he was
