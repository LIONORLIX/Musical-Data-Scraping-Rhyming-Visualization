------ Spread A Little Sunshine ------
--- FASTRADA ---
Back in my younger days, when things were going wrong
I might sulk, I might pout
Now I've learned if I just pitch in and do what's right
Things will always work out
And if we all could spread a little sunshine
All could light a little fire
We all would be a little closer
To our heart's desire
--- Unknown ---
Lord know's we've seen enough troubles already, we've
Had our fill of grey skies
So put down the vinegar, take up the honey jar
You'll catch many more flies
And if we all could spread a little sunshine
All could think before we strike
We all would be a little closer
To the world we'd like
--- Unknown ---
I know the parables told in the holy book
I keep close on my shelf
God's wisdom teaches me when I help others, I'm
Really helping myself
And if we all could spread a little sunshine
All could lend a helping hand
We all would be a little closer
To the promised land.
