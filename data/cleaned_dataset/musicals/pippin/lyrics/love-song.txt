------ Love Song ------
--- PIPPIN ---
Sitting on the floor and talking till dawn
--- CATHERINE ---
Candles and confidences
--- PIPPIN ---
Trading old beliefs and humming old songs
--- CATHERINE ---
And lowering old defenses
--- PIPPIN ---
Singing a
--- BOTH ---
Love song-- La la la la la la la la la la
Love song-- La la la la
--- PIPPIN ---
Private little jokes and silly pet names
--- CATHERINE ---
Lavender soap and lotions
--- PIPPPIN ---
All of the cliches and all of the games
--- CATHERINE ---
And all of the strange emotions
--- PIPPIN ---
Singing a
--- BOTH ---
Love song-- La la la la la la la la la la
Love song-- La la la la la
--- PIPPIN ---
They say the whole is greater
--- BOTH ---
Than the sum of the parts it's made of
--- PIPPIN ---
Well if it's true of anything
--- BOTH ---
It's true of love
--- PIPPIN ---
'Cause how can you define a look or a touch?
--- CATHERINE ---
How can you weigh a feeling?
--- PIPPIN ---
Taken by themselves now they don't mean much
--- BOTH ---
Together they send you reeling
--- PIPPIN ---
Into a
--- BOTH ---
Love song-- La la la la la la la la la la
Love song-- La la la la la
--- Unknown ---
La la la la la la la la la la
