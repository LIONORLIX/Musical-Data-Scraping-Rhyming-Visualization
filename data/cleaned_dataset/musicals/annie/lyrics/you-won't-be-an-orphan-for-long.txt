------ You Won't Be an Orphan for Long ------
--- GRACE ---
If he should need the F.B.I.
Then he will have the F.B.I.
--- ALL ---
With all the favors that he's done
J. Edger Hoover owes him one.
--- CECILLE AND ANNETTE ---
'Till not a stone is left unturned
--- Unknown ---
[ALL
He will search everywhere
And he'll find them, I swear.
--- GRACE ---
Oh, you won't be an orphan for long!
--- ALL ---
Where other men would call it quits
And disappear
He'll use his fortune and his wits.
So never fear
Cross the street
Or cross the sea
Annie, sweet
We guarantee
That you won't be an orphan...
--- GRACE AND THE SERVANTS ---
Tomorrow morning it begins
You're with a man who always wins
Trust him and he'll prove
Mountains easily move
Oh, you won't be an orphan --
