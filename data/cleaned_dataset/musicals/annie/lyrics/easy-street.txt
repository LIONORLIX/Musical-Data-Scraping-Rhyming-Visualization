------ Easy Street ------
--- ROOSTER ---
I remember the way
Our sainted mother
Would sit and croon us
Her lullaby
--- MISS HANNIGAN ---
She'd say, kids, there's a place
That's like no other
You got to get there before you die
--- ROOSTER ---
You don't get there
By playing from the rule book
--- MISS HANNIGAN ---
You stack the aces
--- ROOSTER ---
You load the dice
--- MISS HANNIGAN AND ROOSTER ---
Mother dear
Oh, we know you're down there listening --
How can we follow
Your sweet
Advice
To
--- ROOSTER ---
Easy street
Easy street
Where you sleep till noon
--- MISS HANNIGAN ---
Yeah, yeah, yeah
--- ROOSTER AND MISS HANNIGAN ---
She'd repeat
Easy street
Better get there soon.
--- ROOSTER, MISS HANNIGAN, AND LILY ---
Easy street
Easy street
Where the rich folks play
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Move them feet
--- MISS HANNIGAN ---
Move them ever-lovin' feet
--- ROOSTER, MISS HANNIGAN, AND LILY ---
To easy street
--- MISS HANNIGAN ---
Easy street
--- ROOSTER, MISS HANNIGAN, AND LILY ---
When you get there stay
--- ROOSTER ---
It ain't fair
How we scrounge
For three of four bucks
While she gets
Warbucks
--- MISS HANNIGAN ---
The little brat!
It ain't fair this here life
Is drivin' me nuts!
While we get peanuts
She's livin' fat!
--- ROOSTER ---
Maybe she holds the key
That little lady
--- MISS HANNIGAN ---
To gettin' more bucks
--- ROOSTER ---
Instead of less
Maybe we fix the game
With something shady
--- LILY ---
Where does that put us?
--- MISS HANNIGAN ---
Give you one guess
--- ROOSTER, MISS HANNIGAN, AND LILY ---
Yes!
--- Unknown ---
Easy street
Easy street
Annie is the key
Yes sirree
Yes sirree
Yes sirree
Easy street
Easy street
That's where we're gonna --
Be!
