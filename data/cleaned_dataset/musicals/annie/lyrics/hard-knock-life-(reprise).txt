Lucky kid, she's out there free

Runnin' free in N.Y.C.

--- ALL ---
Like that

Right off the bat

Gonna get our faces slapped

Gonna get our knuckles rapped

It's the hard-knock life
--- MOLLY ---
Yes, it is.
--- ALL (EXCEPT MOLLY) ---
It's the hard-knock life
--- MOLLY ---
Yes, it is.
--- ALL (EXCEPT MOLLY) ---
It's the hard-knock life
--- MOLLY ---
Yes, it is.
