------ Something Was Missing ------
--- WARBUCKS ---
I've made me a fortune
Been headlined
And profiled
Again and again
But something was missing
That something was someone --
But who?
--- Unknown ---
My speeches are greeted
With thunderous acclaim
At two universities
Bearing my name
Yes, something was missing
Each timeI got through
That something was someone --
But who?
--- Unknown ---
Who could that someone be?
How could she make it known?
Who would need me for me?
Need me for me alone?
he world was my oyster --
But where was the pearl?
Who dreamed I could find it
Yes something was missing --
But dreams can come true
That something
Is no one
But you
--- Unknown ---
Who would need me for me ?
Need me for me alone
The world was my oyster
But where was the pearl ?
Who'd dream I would find it
In one little girl ?
Yes, something was missing
But dreams do come true
