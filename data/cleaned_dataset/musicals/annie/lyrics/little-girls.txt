------ Little Girls ------
--- MISS HANNIGAN ---
Little girls
Little girls
Everywhere I turn I can see them
Little girls
Little girls
--- Unknown ---
Night and day
I eat, sleep and breathe them
I'm an ordinary woman
With feelings
I'd like a man to nibble on my ear
But I'll admit no man has bit
So how come I'm the mother of the year?
--- Unknown ---
Little cheeks
Little teeth
Everything around me is little
If I wring
Little necks
Surely I will get an acquittal
--- Unknown ---
Some women are dripping with diamonds
Some women are dripping with pearls
Lucky me! Lucky me!
Look at what I'm dripping with
--- Unknown ---
Little girls
How I hate
Little shoes
Little socks
And each little bloomer
I'd have cracked
Years ago
If it weren't for my
Sense of humor
Some day
I'll step on their freckles
Some night
I'll straighten their curls
Send a flood
Send the flu
Anything that You can do
To little girls
Some day I'll land in the nut house
With all the nuts and the squirrels
There I'll stay
Until the prohibition of
