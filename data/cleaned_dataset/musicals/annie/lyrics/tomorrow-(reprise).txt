------ Tomorrow (Reprise) ------
--- ANNIE ---
Just thinkin' about
Tomorrow
Clears away the cobwebs,
And the sorrow
Till there's none!
--- Unknown ---
When I'm stuck a day
That's gray,
And lonely,
I just stick out my chin
And grin,
And say,
--- Unknown ---
Oh, the sun'll come out
Tomorrow
So ya gotta hang on
'Til tomorrow
Come what may
Tomorrow!
Tomorrow!
I love ya Tomorrow!
--- IKES ---
The sun'll come out
Tomorrow
Bet your bottom dollar
That tomorrow
There'll be sun!
--- PERKINS AND IKES ---
Just thinking about
Tomorrow
--- ANNIE, PERKINS AND IKES ---
Clears away the cobwebs
And the sorrow
'Til there's none!
--- ROOSEVELT ---
[spoken] Solo for the President .....!
[singing] When I'm stuck with a day
That's gray and lonely
I just stick out my chin
And grin, and say--
--- ALL ---
The sun'll come out
Tomorrow
So ya gotta hang on
'Til tomorrow
Come what may
Tomorrow!
Tomorrow!
I love ya
Tomorrow!
You're always a day away
Tomorrow! Tomorrow! I love ya, tomorrow
