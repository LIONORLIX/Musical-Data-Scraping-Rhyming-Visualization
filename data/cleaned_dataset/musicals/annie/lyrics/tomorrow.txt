------ Tomorrow ------
--- ANNIE ---
The sun'll come out
Tomorrow
Bet your bottom dollar
That tomorrow
There'll be sun!
--- Unknown ---
Just thinkin' about
Tomorrow
Clears away the cobwebs,
And the sorrow
'Til there's none!
--- Unknown ---
When I'm stuck with a day
That's gray,
And lonely,
I just stick out my chin
And Grin,
And Say,
Oh!
--- Unknown ---
The sun'll come out
Tomorrow
So ya gotta hang on
'Til tomorrow
Come what may
Tomorrow! Tomorrow!
I love ya Tomorrow!
You're only
A day
A way!
