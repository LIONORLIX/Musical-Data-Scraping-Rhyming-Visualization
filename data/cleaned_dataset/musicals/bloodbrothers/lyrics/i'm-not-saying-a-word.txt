------ I'm Not Saying a Word ------

Edward
If i could stand inside his shoes i'd say
How can i compare thee to a summer's day
--- Unknown ---
Linda
Oh go away..
--- Unknown ---
Edward
I'd take a page in all the papers
I'd announce it in the news
If it was the guy, if i was in his shoes
--- Unknown ---
Linda
I'm not with you.
--- Unknown ---
Edward
If i was him i'd bring you flowers
And ask you to dance
We'd while away the hours making
Future plans
For rainy days in country lanes
And trips to the sea
I'd just tell you that i love you
If it was me
--- Unknown ---
But i'm not saying a word,
I'm not saying i care,
Though i would like you to know
--- Unknown ---
That i'm not saying a word,
I'm not saying i care,
Though i would like you to know
If i was him i'd have to tell you
What i've kept in my heart
That even if we had to live
Some worlds apart
There would not beaday
In which i'd not think of you
If i was him, if i was him
That's what i do
--- Unknown ---
But i'm not saying a word
I'm not saying i care
Though i would like you to know
That i'm not saying a word
I'm not saying i care
Though i would like you to know
--- Unknown ---
Edward
But i'm not.
--- Unknown ---
Linda
What?
