The house we got was lovely,
The neighbours are a treat,
They sometimes fight on saturday night,
But never in the week

The milkman insists i call him joe.

He brings me bread and eggs,
Says i've got legs
Like marilyn monroe
Sometimes he takes me dancing
Even takes me dancing
I know our sammy burnt the school down
But it's very easily done.
If the teacher lets the silly gets
Play with magnesium.
Thank god he only got probation
The judge was old and slow
Though it was kind of him,
Said i reminded him of marilyn monroe
--- Unknown ---
Judge
And could i take you dancing?
I'd love to take you dancing young lady

Mrs johnstone
Our mickey's just turned fourteen
Y' know he's at that age
When you mention girls, or courting,
He flies into a rage
--- Unknown ---
Mickey
Shut up talking about me, mother.
--- Unknown ---
Mrs johnstone
He's got a thing for taking blackheads out,
And he thinks that i don't know,
That he dreams all night of girls who look like marilyn monroe
He's even started dancing, secret dancing
And as for the rest, they've flown the nest
Got married or moved away
Our donna marie's already got three
--- Unknown ---
Donna marie
Hello mam.
--- Unknown ---
Mrs johnstone
She' a bit like me.
And that other child of mine,
I haven't seen for years, although
Each day i pray he'll be ok,
Unlike poor marilyn monroe
