------ Tell Me It's Not True ------
--- Unknown ---
Mrs. Johnstone
Tell me it's not true,
Say it's just a story,
Something on the news.
--- Unknown ---
Tell me it's not true,
Though it's here before me,
Say it's just a dream,
Say it's just a scene,
From an old movie of years ago,
From an old movie of marilyn monroe,
--- Unknown ---
Say it's just some clowns,
Two players in the limelight,
And bring the curtain down.
--- Unknown ---
Say it's just two clowns,
Who couldn't get their lines right,
Say it's just a show on the radio,
That we can turn over and start again,
That we can turn over; it's just a game.

Mrs. Johnstone and company
Tell me it's not true,
Say i only dreamed it,
And morning will come soon.
--- Unknown ---
Say you didn't mean it,
Tell me it's not true,
Say it's just pretend,
Say it's just the end,
Of an old movie from years ago,
From an old movie of marilyn monroe.

From an old movie with marilyn monroe.
