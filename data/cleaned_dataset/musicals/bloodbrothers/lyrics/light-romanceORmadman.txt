------ Light Romance/Madman ------
--- Unknown ---
Narrator
There's a girl inside the woman
Who's waiting to get free
She's washed a million dishes
She's always making tea
--- Unknown ---
They think she's just a mother
With nothing left inside
Who swapped her dreams for drudgery
The day she was a bride
But the dreams were not forgotten
Just wrapped, and packed away
In the hope that she could take them out
And dust them off one day
--- Unknown ---
Linda

There's a girl inside the woman
And the mother she became
And half-remembered song comes to her lips again
--- Unknown ---
Linda
Eddie, could i talk to you? Yeh, i remember.
--- Unknown ---
Narrator
The girl would sing the melody
But the woman stands in doubt
And wonders what the price would be
For letting the young girl out
--- Unknown ---
Mrs johnstone
It's just a light romance
It's nothing cruel
They had no plans
How it came
Who can explain?
They just said hello
And foolishly gazed
They should have gone
Their separate ways
--- Unknown ---
It's just the same old song
Nothing cruel, nothing wrong
It's just two fools
Who know the rules
But break them all
And grasp at half a chance
To play their part
In a light romance
--- Unknown ---
Living on the never never,
Constant as the changing weather,
Never sure
Who's as the door,
Or the price
You're gonna have to pay
--- Unknown ---
Mrs johnstone
It's just a secret glance
Across a room
A touch of hands
That part too soon
That same old tune
That always plays
And lets them dance as friends
Then stand apart
As the music ends
--- Unknown ---
Loving on the never never
Constant as the changing weather
Never sure
Who's at the door
Or the price you're gonna have to pay
Mickey...
