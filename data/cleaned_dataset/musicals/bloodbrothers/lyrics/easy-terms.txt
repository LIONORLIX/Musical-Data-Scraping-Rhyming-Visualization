------ Easy Terms ------
--- Unknown ---
Mrs johnstone
Only mine until
The time comes round
To pay the bill.
Then i'm afraid.
What can't be paid
Must be returned.
You never, ever learn,
That nothing's yours,
On easy terms.
--- Unknown ---
Only for a time,
I must not learn,
To call you mine.
--- Unknown ---
Familiarise
That face, those eyes
Make future plans
That cannot be confirmed
On borrowed time,
On easy terms.
--- Unknown ---
Living on the never never,
Constant as the changing weather,
Never sure
Who's at the door
Or the price i'll have to pay
Should we meet again
I will not recognise your name.
You can be sure
What's gone before
Will be concealed.
Your friends will never learn
That once we were
On easy terms.
--- Unknown ---
Living on the never never,
Constant as the changing weather,
Never sure
Who's at the door
Or the price i'll have to pay...

A bargain. You swore on the bible.

Mrs johnstone
No. Don't tell me which one. Just take him,

--- Unknown ---
Living on the never never,
Constant as the changing weather,
Never sure
Who's at the door
Or the price i'll have to pay,
Should we meet again...
