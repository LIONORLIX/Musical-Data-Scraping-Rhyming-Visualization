------ Marilyn Monroe 3 ------
--- Unknown ---
Mrs johnstone
The jury found him guilty
Sent him down for seven years
Though he acted like they gave him life,
He couldn't stop the tears.
And when we went to visit him
He didn't want to know,
It seems like jails sent him off the rails.
Just like marilyn monroe
His mind's gone dancing
Can't stop dancing
--- Unknown ---
They showed him to a doctor
And after routine test
A prescription note the doctor wrote
For the chronically depressed.
And now the tears have stopped
He sits and counts the days to go
And treats his ills with daily pills
Just like marilyn monroe
--- Unknown ---
They stop his mind from dancing
Stop it dancing

Linda

Mickey

You'll be home soon, mickey, and you should
Come off them.
--- Unknown ---
Mickey

--- Unknown ---

--- Unknown ---
Linda

--- Unknown ---
Mickey
He said, about me nerves an' how i get
Depressed an' i need to take these cos they
Make me better...
--- Unknown ---
Linda
I get depressed but i don't take those. You
Don't need those, mickey
--- Unknown ---
Mickey
Leave me alone, will y'? I can't cope with this.
I'm not well. The doctor said, didn't he, i'm not
Well... I can't do things. Just leave me alone linda.
--- Unknown ---
Mrs johnstone
With grace for good behaviour
He got out before his time
The family and the neighbours told him
He was lookin' fine.
But he's feelin' fifteen years older
And his speech is rather slow
And his neighbours said
You'd think he was dead
Like marilyn monroe
No cause for dancing
No more dancing...
--- Unknown ---
Mickey
Where's me tablets gone, linda?
--- Unknown ---
Linda
Mickey you promised.
--- Unknown ---
Mickey
I know i promised but i can't do without them.
--- Unknown ---
Linda
Look. We've... We've managed to sort ourselves
This far but what's the use if
--- Unknown ---
Mickey
Have we sorted ourselves out? Do you think i'm
Really stupid?
--- Unknown ---
Linda
What?
--- Unknown ---
Mickey
You sorted it out. You an' councillor eddie lyons.
Now give me tablets...i need them.
--- Unknown ---
Linda
An' what about what i need? I need you.
I love you.
