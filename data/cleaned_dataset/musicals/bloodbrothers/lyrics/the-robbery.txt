------ The Robbery ------
--- Unknown ---
Narrator
There's a full moon shining
And a joker in the pack
The dealer's dealt the cards,
And he won't take them back
There's a black cat stalking
And a woman who's afraid
That there's no getting off
Without the price being paid

Sammy
Don't mess about with me, pal... I said give!
Listen, it's not a toy y' know. We're not playin'
Games. Y' don't get up again if one of these hits
Y' ... What are you doin'? I said listen to me, i said...
Don't you touch that.. Listen.

And maybe, if you counted ten and kept your
Fingers crossed
It would all be just a game and then no-one
Would have lost
