The wobbly wardrobe,
Chest of drawers that never close.
The two legged chair, the carpet so bare.

Now that we're movin'

For it's no longer fitting, for me to be sitting
On a sofa, i know for a fact was knocked off

Be all'lardie dah',
An' go drivin' out to the sands.

Mrs johnstone
At the weekend,
A gentleman friend,
Might take me dancing
To the local bands
We'll have a front room
And then if it should happen,
That his holiness flies in from rome,
He can sit there with me,
Eating toast, drinking tea
In the sort of surroundings
That remind him of home
--- Unknown ---
Mickey
It's like the country isn't it, mam?
--- Unknown ---

The muck an' the dirt an' the bloody trouble
