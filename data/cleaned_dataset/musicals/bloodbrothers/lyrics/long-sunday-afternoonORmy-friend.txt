No kids out on the street today.
You could be living on she moon.
Maybe everybody's packed their bags
And moved away
Gonna bea long. Long. Long
Sunday afternoon
--- Unknown ---
Just killing time ano kicking cans around
Try to remember jokes i knew,
I tell'em to myself,
But they're not funny since i found
It's gonna be a long, long, long
Sunday afternoon
--- Unknown ---
My best friend
Always had sweets to share,
Knew every word in the dictionary
He was clean, neat and tidy
From monday to friday,
I wish that i could be like
Wear clean clothes, talk properly like
Do sums and history like

Edward
My best friend
He could swear like a soldier
You would laugh till you died
At the stories he told y'
He was untidy
From monday to friday
I wish that i could be like
Kick a ball and climb a tree like
Run around with dirty knees like

Feels like everybody stayed in bed
Or maybe i woke too soon.
Am i the last survivor
Is everybody dead?
On this long, long, long
Sunday afiernoon
