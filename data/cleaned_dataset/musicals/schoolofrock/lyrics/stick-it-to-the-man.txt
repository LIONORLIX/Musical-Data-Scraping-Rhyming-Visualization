------ Stick It to the Man ------
--- Unknown ---
When the world has screwed you,
And crushed you in it’s fist.
When the way your treated,
Has got you good and pissed.
There's been one solution,
Since the world began.
Don’t just sit and take it,
Stick it to the man.
Rant and rave
and scream and shout.
Get all of your aggression out.
They try to stop you,
let ‘em know
exactly where they all can go.
And do it just as loudly as you can!
Stick it to the man.
Parents overwork ya,
Stick It To The Man!
Hate The Way They Jerk Ya!
Tired of the system!
Stick it to the man!
Rise up every system!
Stick it to the man!
Break the rules,
Ignore the signs!
And color way outside the line!
Go off the script!
Do what you like!
They hate it, they can take a hike.
And do it just as loudly as you can!!
Stick it to the man!
“If you're feeling angry,
then put into your music!!!
Failing MP Sessions!
Stick it to the man!
Parents all up in your face yes!?
Stick it to the man!
Bullied for eating good snack foods!
Stick it to the man!
Rock the house and make a scene
And cranks the amps to 17.
And scream until their ears are shot
They all can kiss your you know what.
Do everything they ever tried to ban!!
Stick it to the man!
When the world has screwed you,
And crushed you in it’s fist.
When the way your treated,
Has got you good and pissed.
There’s been one solution,
Since the world began.
Don’t just sit and take it,
Stick it to the man!
Rant and rave and scream and shout!
Stick your middle finger out!
Just be rude,
And rip your jeans.
And show ‘em what rebellion means.
Let’s barge in someone else’s camera van!
Especially those we’re SO much cooler than!
It’s time to throw some shit against a fan!
There's no way you can stop,
The School Of Rock!!!!!!!!!!!
