------ In the End of Time (A Cappella Version) ------
--- Unknown ---
*It starts off...a dark stage and then a beam of light, and you can see me and my guitar*
--- Unknown ---
In the end of time
There was a man who knew the road
And the writing, was written on the stone
--- Unknown ---
*And then a thin layer of fog comes in around my ankles
Roadies that means dry ice we're gonna talk about this later*
--- Unknown ---
In the ancient time
An artist led the way
But no one, seemed to understand
--- Unknown ---
*Chimes, Freddy*
--- Unknown ---
In his heart he knew
The artist must be true
But the legend, of the rent was way past due
--- Unknown ---
*And then Katie you come in with the bass*
--- Unknown ---
Well you think you'll be just fine...without me, but your mine!
You think you can, kick me out of the band
--- Unknown ---
*And then Zach you come in with the face melter*

Well there's just one problem there
The band is mine
How can you kick me out...of what is mine
--- Unknown ---
*And then...Hawaii 5-0, you ever see that show? O.K. well there's a drum solo in there...

You?re not hardcore
Unless you live hardcore
--- Unknown ---
*And then... that's where I want the back-up singers to be like*
--- Unknown ---
Well you?re not hardcore
Unless you live hardcore
But the legend of the rent was way hardcore
--- Unknown ---
*Boom! Big ol' explosion...some like confetti comes down
Anyway, that's all I got so far, it's a work in progress*
