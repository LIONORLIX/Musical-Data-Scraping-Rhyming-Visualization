------ If Only You Would Listen ------
--- Unknown ---
You always talk, talk, talk all the time.
You never let me get in a word.
I wish i had, i had a dime
For ev’ry thought i’ve swallowed unheard.
No matter what it is that i do,
It’s like i just can’t seem to get through.
--- Unknown ---
I’ve got so much to say,
If only you would listen.
I’ve tried ev’ry which way,
And still you never listen.
Can’t you see i’m hurting?
I couldn’t be more clear.
But i promise,
One day i’ll make you hear.
--- Unknown ---
You know i try, try, try to explain--
I’m not the kid you want me to be.
And yet it’s all, it’s all in vain--
You just don’t wanna see the real me.
You think you know what i’m all about--
And yet you just keep shutting me out!
--- Unknown ---
I’ve got so much to share,
If only you would listen.
You could prove that you care,
If only you would listen.
I’m not gonna beg you--
You’ll never see a tear.
But i promise, one day, i’ll make you hear.
--- Unknown ---
Yeah, you’ll see one day,
I’m gonna make you hear me.
Gotta find a way,
But you are gonna hear me.
Got so much to say
And i’m gonna make you hear me.
--- Unknown ---
Maybe then you’ll listen!
You gotta listen!
You need to listen!
You better listen!
--- Unknown ---
I’ve got so much inside,
If only you would listen!
Joy and anger and pride,
If only you would listen!
It’s not much i’m asking
I only want your ear.
Yeah, i promise, one day i’ll make you hear.
It’s not much i’m asking,
I only want your ear.
--- Unknown ---
And i promise, one day i’ll shake you,
So damn hard that at last i’ll wake you,
Yeah, i promise, one day i’ll make you hear!
