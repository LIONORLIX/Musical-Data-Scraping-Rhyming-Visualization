------ School Of Rock (Teacher's Pet) ------
--- Unknown ---
Baby, we was makin' straight A's
But we were stuck in a dumb daze
Don't take much to memorize your lies
I feel like I've been hypnotized
--- Unknown ---
And then, that magic man, he come to town.
Woo-Wee! He come n spun my head around
He said Recess is in session,
Two and two make five.
And now, baby, oh, I'm alive.
Ah Yea! I am alive.
--- Unknown ---
And if you wanna be the teacher's pet
Well, baby, you just better forget it.
Rock got no reason, rock got no rhyme
You better get me to school on time.
--- Unknown ---
Oh, you know I was on the Honor Roll
Got good grades, and got no soul
Raise my hand before I can speak my mind
I've been biting my tongue too many times
--- Unknown ---
And then that magic man took to obey (uh huh)
Do what magic man do, not what magic man say
Now, can I please have the attention of the class.
Today's ass-ignment... (hem hem)
KICK SOME ASS!

Now ya'll know who I am
I might not be that perfect son
