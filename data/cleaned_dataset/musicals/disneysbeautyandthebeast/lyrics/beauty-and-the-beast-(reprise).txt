------ Beauty and the Beast (Reprise) ------
--- Belle/Prince ---
Two lives have begun now
Two hearts become one now
One passion, one dream
One thing forever true
All:
I love you!
Certain as the sun
Rising in the east
Tale as old as time
Song as old as rhyme
Beauty and the Beast.
--- Unknown ---
Tale as old as time
Song as old as rhyme
Beauty and the Beast.
