Mmmm:.
--- HARLEM MAN ---
Mmmmm:.
--- HARLEM MAN ---
Here he comes again - that cracker who doesn't know he's a cracker.
We should have kicked his ass the first
time he came looking for Coalhouse.
--- HARLEM WOMAN ---
They must think we're fools.
--- YOUNGER BROTHER ---
Good evening. I would still very much like to talk to Mr. Coalhouse Walker, Jr.
--- HARLEM WOMAN ---
This is still Harlem and this is still a private thoroughfare, cracker.
--- YOUNGER BROTHER ---
I told you: I shall come here every evening until he is satisfied that it is safe to receive me.
--- HARLEM MAN ---
And that time will be never!
--- YOUNGER BROTHER ---
But Mr. Walker knows me. I'm his friend.
--- HARLEM WOMAN ---
Try that pestilent pond where they sank his car.
--- YOUNGER BROTHER ---
I've been there.
--- HARLEM WOMAN ---
Try that cemetery where he buried his Sarah like a queen.
--- YOUNGER BROTHER ---
I've been there, too.
--- HARLEM MAN ---
Then try the Gates of Justice where they are deaf to his misery and anger.
--- YOUNGER BROTHER ---
I understand how you feel.
--- COALHOUSE FOLLOWER ---
You got a dime?
--- COALHOUSE FOLLOWER ---
You seem to have a lot of change there. Could you manage a quarter?
--- COALHOUSE FOLLOWER ---
What about a silver dollar?
