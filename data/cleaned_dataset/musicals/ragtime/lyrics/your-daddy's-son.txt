------ Your Daddy's Son ------
--- SARAH ---
Ooh...
--- Unknown ---
Daddy played piano,
Played it very well.
Music from those hands could
Catch you like a spell.
He coul dmake you love him
'Fore the tune was done.
You have your daddy's hands.
You are your daddy's son.
--- Unknown ---
Ooh...
--- Unknown ---
Daddy never knew
That you were on your way.
--- Unknown ---
He had other ladies
And other tunes to play.
When he up and left me,
I just up and run.
--- Unknown ---
Only thing in my head-
You were your daddy's son.
--- Unknown ---
Couldn't hear no music,
Couldn't see no light.
Mama, she was frightened,
Crazy from the fright.
Tears without no comfort,
Screams without no sound.
Only darkness and pain,
The anger and pain,
The blood and the pain!
I buried my hear in the ground!
In the ground-
When I buried you in the ground.
--- Unknown ---
Daddy played piano.
Bet he's playin' still.
Mama can't forget him.
Don't suppose I will.
God wants no excuses.
I have only one:
You had your daddy's hands.
Forgive me.
You were your daddy's son.
