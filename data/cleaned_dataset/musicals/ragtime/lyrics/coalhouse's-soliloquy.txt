------ Coalhouse's Soliloquy ------
--- COALHOUSE ---
Say goodbye to music.
Say goodbye to light.
Anything i care for
Take it from my sight.
Let me see no future.
Let me hear no sound.
Only darkness and pain,
The anger and pain,
The blood and the pain.
They buried my heart in the ground,
In the ground.
When they buried you in the ground.
--- Unknown ---
Sarah, my life has changed.
Sarah, the world has changed...
--- Unknown ---
I see his face
And he will ride
On the wheels of a new dream, sarah,
A new day, sarah, now,
I'll play them the music
Of something beginning,
An era exploding,
A century spinning.
My law and my justice
In rhythm and rhyme!
Listen to that ragtime!
