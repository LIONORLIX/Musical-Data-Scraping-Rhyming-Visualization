------ Atlantic City ------
--- EVELYN ---
Whee!
Let's run away to Atlantic City
Let's feel the wind in our hair...
--- FATHER ---
Atlantic City is only a temporary answer, Mother, but I can't think of a better one.
They can't take the child away from you if we're in residence down there
and it's close enough to come and go as business dictates.
--- EVELYN ---
Sharing a grand and romantic city.
--- HOUDINI ---
Sea and salty air.
--- FATHER ---
Besides, the change of air will do everyone good. Did you pack my razor?
--- MOTHER ---
Yes.
--- FATHER ---
I hope you reserved us a parlour car?
--- MOTHER ---
I did.
--- EVELYN ---
Train's gonna take us to the sunniest hideaway.
--- HOUDINI ---
Troubles will slide away
--- EVELYN & HOUDINI ---
Just a ride away...
--- FATHER ---
It was clear to Father that the crisis was driving the spirit from their lives.
He had always secretly believed that as a family they were touched by an extra light.
He felt it going now.
--- Unknown ---
Mother, I...
--- MOTHER ---
There's the cab.
--- FATHER ---
Where have I been?
How did we change
Caught in this strange new music
Say, was I away too long?
Say, when they did they change the song?
--- VACATIONERS ---
Let's run away to Atlantic City
Let's feel the win in our hair
Sharing a grand and romantic city
Sea and salty air
Train's gonna take us
To the sunniest hideaway
Troubles will slide away.
--- WOMEN VACATIONERS ---
Just a ride away.
--- VACATIONERS ---
So let's run away to Atlantic City
No one will find us there.
--- VACATIONERS ---
Down on the sand
There's a Ragtime band
--- BAND MEMBERS ---
With a brand-new
Ragtime tune.
--- ALL ---
And up in the sky
There's a grand New Jersey moon!
Let's go there soon...
--- EVELYN ---
Whee!!!
I was once the lady friend of Stanford White
Made me a celebrity overnight!
Well, overnight things change I guess.
I'm in New Jersey--wearing even less!
Ladies, there's a lesson in my tawdry tale
Beware the path you choose
Oh! Oh! Justice is never fair.
Bang! Bang! There goes your millionaire
Boo hoo! No money, no ring
And you could end up on a swing
And it's a crime...
--- HARRY ---
Harry Houdini Master escapist. Buried and chained and tied.
Reaching for danger, darker and stranger now that his mama's died.
Conquering fear in hopes he will hear a voice from the other side...
--- EVELYN ---
Oh, justice can be so unfair! Bang! There goes your millionaire! Whee!
--- HARRY ---
Come see Houdini's daring display
--- EVELYN ---
Come see Miss Nesbit do four shows a day
--- EVELYN & HARRY ---
Thrilling the crowd and making 'em say...
--- HOUDINI ---
Let's run away
--- ALL ---
Let's run away to Atlantic City
--- EVELYN ---
Let's run away
--- EVELYN, HARRY, ALL ---
My honey...
--- Unknown ---
Why should we stay in the frantic city
Laden with worry and care?
Oh, let's run away to Atlantic City
No one will find us
--- EVELYN ---
No one will find us
--- ALL ---
No one will find us there!
