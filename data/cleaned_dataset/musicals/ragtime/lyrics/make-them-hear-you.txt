------ Make Them Hear You ------
--- COAL HOUSE ---
Go out and tell our story.
Let it echo far and wide.
Make them hear you.
Make them hear you.
--- Unknown ---
How that justice was our battle and how justice was denied.
Make them hear you.
Make them hear you.
--- Unknown ---
And say to those who blame us
For the way we chose to fight
That sometimes there are battles
That are more than black or white.
--- Unknown ---
And I could not put down my sword
When justice was my right
Make them hear you
Make them hear you
--- Unknown ---
Go out and tell our story
To your daughters and your sons.
Make them hear you.
Make them hear you.
--- Unknown ---
And tell them in our struggles
We were not the only ones
Make them hear you.
Make them hear you.
--- Unknown ---
Your sword can be a sermon
or the power of the pen
Teach every child to raise his voice
and then my brothers, then
--- Unknown ---
Will justice be demanded
By ten million righteous men.
Make them hear you.
When they hear you
I'll be near you, again.
