------ Look What You've Done ------
--- WOMEN AT VIGIL ---
A day of peace.
A day of pride.
A day of justice.
We have been denied.
Let the new day dawn,
Oh, Lord, I pray!
--- WHITMAN ---
Mr. Walker. This is This is District Attorney Charles S. Whitman.
Do you hear me? I have Fire Chief Willie
Conklin with me. He is restoring your car. Will you come out, sir?
--- WILLIE CONKLIN ---
You gonna let me be a martyr!
--- WHITMAN ---
Mr. Conklin will receive due process. You both will.
--- MORGAN ---
How much longer are you going to stand for this?
Give him his car and then hang the savage!
--- WHITMAN ---
I'm doing my best, Mr. Morgan.
--- CONKLIN ---
This is a conspiracy of nigger lovers, that's all it is.
--- FATHER ---
Sir, if I might suggest.
--- WHITMAN ---
Who the hell are you?
--- FATHER ---
You sent for me. I know Mr.
Walker and I believe there's one man he'll listen to.
Mr. Booker T. Washington.
--- VIGIL WOMEN ---
Justice! Ah!
--- BOOKER T. WASHINGTON ---
For the sum of my life I have lived in hope we might all be Christian brothers.
I have worked to persuade every white-skinned man
that he need not fear our race.
What has your selfish recklessness cost us,we who
work so hard to still the white man's hate.
Look what you've done.
--- VIGIL WOMEN ---
Day of peace...Day of pride...
Justice! Justice!
--- WHITMAN ---
You are surrounded by militia. they are cutting off your water even as I speak.
--- J.P. MORGAN ---
Four Shakespeare folios! A Gutenberg bible on vellum.
The treasures of civilization are at stake!
You've got to do something!
--- WILLIE CONKLIN ---
White people should be grateful for what I done!
--- EMMA GOLDMAN ---
I deplore the taking of human life, nut I applaud Mr.
Walker's capture of the Morgan library.
His actions speak for all oppressed people.
It is the cry of revolution.
--- VIGIL WOMEN ---
Justice!
--- BOOKER T. WASHINGTON ---
With guns and dynamite, you are destroying everything I have fought for, sir.
--- COALHOUSE ---
Despite the respect I have for you, Mr. Washington, you have come in vain.
--- WASHINGTON ---
Had you been ignorant of the tragic struggle of our people,
I could have pitied you this adventure.
But you are a trained musician, an educated man.
--- COALHOUSE ---
It is true, sir.
But I hope that I might suggest to you the solemn calculation of my mind.
We are both men of colour who insist on the truth of our manhood,
and the respect it demands!
--- Unknown ---
MEN, FATHER: Hours passing by and not a sign from Coalhouse!
Hours passing by, the situation hopeless!
Hours passing by...Hours passing by...
--- WOMEN ---
Hours passing by and not a sign from Coalhouse!
Hours passing by, the situation hopeless! Hours passing by...
--- WASHINGTON ---
Your situation is hopeless.
And you will be responsible for the death of these young men.

COALHOUSE FOLLOWER #1
Don't listen to him, Coalhouse.
--- Unknown ---
COALHOUSE FOLLOWER #2
They're using him to get to you.
--- Unknown ---
COALHOUSE FOLLOWER #3
We're not giving up.
--- WASHINGTON ---
And you dare to teach your lessons
To these wild, unthinking youths.
Yet your own son, you abandon
To be raised on white men's truths.
Look what you've done.
Think of your son.
--- Unknown ---
SARAH (offstage)
Oooh...
--- WASHINGTON ---
Is this the legacy you would bestow upon him?
Are these the shoulders you would have him stand upon?
Let him be the son of a man who had the courage to tell the truth in a court of law.
Make your case, and if the verdict is death, go to it proudly,
knowing that you have been heard.
The truth is all. If you do this, you
will have the thanks and respect of every decent man of colour
and of all those children of our race whose way is hard and whose journey is long.
Think of your son.
--- COALHOUSE ---
I would need a hostage and safe passage for my men.
--- WASHINGTON ---
It is done.
--- YOUNGER BROTHER ---
You can't change your demands. You are betraying us.
You said we would all go free or we all would die!
--- COALHOUSE ---
And the promise of a fair trial.
--- YOUNGER BROTHER ---
No!
--- WASHINGTON ---
You have my word. I am their mediator, sir, not their fool.
--- COALHOUSE ---
Then they will see me come out with my hands raised,
and no further harm will come to any man from Coalhouse Walker, Jr.
--- WASHINGTON ---
God bless you sir.
--- Unknown ---
FOLLOWER #1
You said we'd fight to the finish.
--- Unknown ---
FOLLOWER #2
Yeah, you can go out there, man. We ain't.
--- Unknown ---
FOLLOWER #3
We're all ready to die as Coalhouse.
--- FOLLOWER ---
Push the plunger! Blow it all up!
--- COALHOUSE ---
I will not trade your precious lives for anything in this world.
--- YOUNGER BROTHER ---
Is a goddamn Model T your justice then?
--- COALHOUSE ---
Is your execution yours?
--- FATHER ---
Coalhouse. Mr. Coalhouse Walker, Jr. It is I, sir, the hostage you demanded.
--- FATHER ---
Your car is ready, Mr. Walker. I think you will be satisfied.
--- FATHER ---
You!
--- YOUNGER BROTHER ---
Yes.
--- FATHER ---
I myself require nothing from you.
But don't you feel your sister deserves an explanation?
--- YOUNGER BROTHER ---
You may tell my sister that she will always be in my thoughts.
You may tell her that I have always loved and admired her.
--- COALHOUSE ---
Are you ready?
--- FOLLOWER ---
We're not going. You've lost, Coalhouse. We've all lost.
--- COALHOUSE ---
I don't believe that.
