--- TATEH ---
I promised you America
And little one, we're there.
--- IMMIGRANTS, LITTLE GIRL ---
America!
--- TATEH ---
Out feet are on the solid ground
And hope is in the air!
--- IMMIGRANTS, LITTLE GIRL ---
America!
--- TATEH ---
You'll soon be eating apple pie
From off a china plate.
Pretty dresses, pretty dolls,
Just wait!
For shining in your Tateh's eye
And just beyond this gate-
--- ALL ---
America!
--- TATEH ---
Here in America
Anyone at all can succeed.
--- IMMIGRANTS ---
America! Here in America!
--- TATEH ---
Do what you do,
And the world will come to you
Guranteed!
--- IMMIGRANTS ---
America! Here in America!
--- TATEH ---
I may be just a maker of art,
But here you can start with less
And make a success!
--- TATEH ---
Step right up and have a silhouette made by
a real artist! With ordinary paper, a pair of scissors
and some glue I will give you a thing of such
beauty! A life-like portrait of someone you love.
Silhouettes of your favorite celebrity.

Evelyn Nesbit. Hey look!
She's on her Vaudeville stage.
harry Houdini. He practically escapes
From the page.
Only a nickel.
Don't walk away!
Someday these will impress
When I'm a success!
--- IMMIGRANTS (2 groups) ---
America, America.
--- TATEH ---
Look at the silhouettes
Here in the tenements,
Bent over sewing
Or dancing or arguing
Thouands of silhouettes,
Thousands of stories to tell.
--- Unknown ---
Look at them, little one,
Such opportunity!
Right on the corner of
Orchard and Rivington.
We'll make our silhouettes,
Think how they'll sell.
We'll join the parade
or Americans all doing well!
--- IMMGRANTS ---
Success!
Success!

The wealthiest man on this earth!

And you'll see what money is worth!

One day your immigrant sweat
Might get you the whole U.S.!
--- HOUDINI ---
And if you're trapped
And failure seems imminent,
Think of Houdini,
That fabulous immigrant!
Break those chains with all you possess!
--- MORGAN, IMMIGRANTS ---
This is America!
This is the land of success!
--- SAME & TATEH ---
Success!
--- EMMA GOLDMAN ---
The angry, fetid tenements of the Lower East Side were
worse than anything Tateh and his wife suffered in Latvia.
The Little Girl was often sick now.
Tateh wrapped her in his prayer shawl.
What rabbi would disapprove?
--- IMMIGRANTS ---
America!
--- TATEH ---
Look at my daughter, God.
Why have you brought us here?
How can I feed her or clothe
Or protect her here?
Where's the America
We were supposed to get?
Was it a silhouette?
hey, mister,
Here in America
Anything you want, you can be!
--- Unknown ---
Sucker, step up,
And I'll cut you out your own guratee!
Come see the artist!
Big shot, oh yes!
red, white and blue!
Hoorau and God bless!
I'm a success!
I'm a success!
Success!
Success!
--- HOUDINI ---
And if you're trapped
And failure seems imminent,
Think of Houdini,
That fabulous immigrant!
Break those chains with all you possess!
--- TATEH ---
I promised you America,
And little one...
We will find it.
