------ President ------
--- SARAH ---
I'll tell him...
President, I am coming to you
On behalf of Coalhouse Walker
He don't know I'm here...
He's much too proud!
And I ain't much of a talker
But President, he needs your help, sir
You're the only one
'Cause Coalhouse, he won't marry me
Till this thing is done
And President, we got a son!

(The march music is suddenly very loud, very real.
SARAH breaks through the police barricade and rushes
towards him, her arm outstretched to him.)
--- SARAH ---
President! President!!
--- MORGAN ---
She's got a gun!
--- Unknown ---
(The police officers club SARAH with their nightsticks. She falls to the ground.)
