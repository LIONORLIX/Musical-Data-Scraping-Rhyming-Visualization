------ New Music ------
--- FATHER ---
Where have I been?
How did we change,
Caught in this strange
New music?
Say,
Was I away too long?
--- MOTHER ---
Just like that tune,
Simple and clear,
I've come to hear
New music.
--- FATHER ---
New music.
--- Unknown ---
Why,
Why can't you hear the song?
--- YOUNGER BROTHER ---
His fingers stoke those keys,
And every note says Please,
And every chord says Turn my way.
--- MOTHER, FATHER ---
I thought I knew
What love was but these lovers play...
--- MOTHER, FATHER, YOUNGER BROTHER ---
New music!
Haunting me,
And somehow taunting me-
My love was never half as true.
--- FATHER ---
And I as myself,
Why can't I sing it too?
--- WORKERS, NEIGHBORS ---
His fingers stoke those keys,
And every note says Please,
And every chord says Turn my way.
--- WORKERS, NEIGHBORS, FAMILY ---
I thought I knew
What love was
but these lovers play
New music!
--- ALL ---
Haunting me,
And somehow taunting me-
My love was
Never half as true.
--- COALHOUSE ---
Sarah, my life has changed.
Sarah, you've got to see.
Sarah, we got a son!
Sarah, come down to me...
--- SARAH ---
You and your music
Singing deep in me,
Making nice to me,
Saying something so new-
--- COALHOUSE ---
New
--- SARAH ---
Changing everything,
Meaning everything,
--- COALHOUSE ---
Music
--- SARAH ---
Calling my heart to you...
--- COALHOUSE ---
All for you, girl.
You, Sarah.
--- SARAH ---
Play that melody,
Your sweet melody,
Calling my heart to you.
--- COALHOUSE ---
You.
--- ALL (except Coalhouse & Sarah) ---
Just like that tune,
Simple and clear,
I've come to hear
New music-
Breaking my heart,
Op'ning a door,
Chamging the world!
New music!
I'll
Hear it forevermore!
