------ Sarah Brown Eyes ------
--- COALHOUSE ---
What's your name?
--- SARAH ---
Sarah.
--- COALHOUSE ---
I'm Coalhouse.
--- SARAH ---
I know.
--- COALHOUSE ---
There was no music
In my heart tonight.
Melodies kept refusin' to flow.
One look at you,
Now every note feels right.
Comin' out all sweet and slow.
--- SARAH ---
You tell stories
Like your hands play tunes.
--- COALHOUSE ---
Sweetest tune I know
Is Sarah Brown Eyes.
Don't be shy, now.
Sarah Brown Eyes
Oughta take a chance.
The stars are
Silver notes
Across that sky now.
Sarah Brown Eyes.
Come, let's dance.
--- SARAH ---
I never heard no music
Quite like yours.
Where'd you learn
How to play it that way?
Was I smart,
I'd walk right out those doors.
--- COALHOUSE ---
Then I've got to make you stay.
--- BOTH ---
Nothin' for it but a ragtime tune
On that piano...
Sarah Brown Eyes,
Don't be shy now.
Sarah Brown Eyes,
Oughta take a chance.
The stars are
Silver notes
Across that sky now.
Sarah Brown Eyes,
Come, let's dance...
Silver notes
Across that sky now.
Sarah Brown Eyes,
Come, let's...
--- SARAH ---
Dance...
