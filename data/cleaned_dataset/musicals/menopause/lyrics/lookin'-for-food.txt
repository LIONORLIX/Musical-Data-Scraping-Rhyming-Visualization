------ Lookin' for Food ------
--- Unknown ---
I chew lettuce in the set.
But the moment I set on the door.
Anything I can get my claws on
--- Unknown ---
I spent a lifetime looking so thin.
Salad bars with no fat dressing were really in.
Playing the diet game hoping to win.
Hiding the candy and lying again.
--- Unknown ---
Now I'm packing up pounds where I didn't have spaces.
Looking for food in too many places.
Stacking the shelves, buying by cases of food I dream about.
Sucking my gut to zip by blue jeans.
Elastic waist you know what I mean.
Looking for food.
Looking for food.
--- Unknown ---
Now when I'm starving when no fries in sight.
A quarter of rocky road will get me through the night.
--- Unknown ---
Don't know when it started and when it might end.
I turned to milk shake and call it my first.
