------ I'm Flashing ------
--- Unknown ---
I'm flashing
just flashing
and the glow is not my jewels
I didn't know.. the change could be so crewl
--- Unknown ---
ohhh yes
--- Unknown ---
They tell me, feeling flushed
is part of passing through
But I just soaked
another blouse thats new
--- Unknown ---
ohhh yes
--- Unknown ---
(She's Flashing) I'm flashing
(Just Flashing) Just Flashing
Please accept my apology,
but estrogens gone
and I'm on my own, you see.
