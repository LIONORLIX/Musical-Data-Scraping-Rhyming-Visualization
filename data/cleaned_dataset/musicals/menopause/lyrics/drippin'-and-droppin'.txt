------ Drippin' and Droppin' ------
--- Unknown ---
Drippin' and droppin' and plinkin' and ploppin', tricklin' and ticklin'
Runnin' a race to my chest from my face
Although I'm lookin' to find ways to seem composed..what I gotta do is
fan it and dab it and wipe it
from the tip of my nose.

When my hair is stuck to my brow
mascara runs down my cheek;
I want to stand up and strip;
But all I can do is
fan it and dab it, blot it and wipe it.
Just Drippin' and droppin' and plinkin' and ploppin', tricklin' and ticklin'
Runnin' a race to my chest from my face
Although I'm lookin' to find ways to seem composed..what I gotta do is
fan it and dab it and blot it and wipe it yeah and do it and smile as I do so no one knows.
