------ Finale/Thank Heaven For Little Girls (Reprise) ------
--- GRANDMAMA ---
Thank heaven-
HONOR AND CHORUS:
For little girls
For little girls get bigger everyday
Thank heaven for little girls,
They grow up in the most delightful way.
CHORUS:
Those little eyes so helpless and appealing,
One day will flash and send you crashing
Through the ceiling.
Thank heaven for little girls,
Thank heaven for them all,
No matter where, no matter who,
Without them, what would little boys do?
HONOR AND CHORUS:
Thank heaven (Thank heaven)
Thank heaven (Thank heaven)
Thank heaven (Thank heaven)
