------ The Earth and Other Minor Things ------
--- Unknown ---
The Postman or mama or Aunt Alicia
That`s all it seems to be a question of.
--- Unknown ---
A pauper or a slave or Aunt Alicia
But not a mention anywhere of love.
--- Unknown ---
What is there than anyone can teach?
If everything I want is out of reach?
--- Unknown ---
I know about the earth and other minor things
Why caterpillars smile and summertime has wings
How if somewhere there?s always a dawn
The earth must be worth being on
But there`s something that makes a continual riddle of it
Why oh why I`m here in the middle of it all.
I don`t belong where the crowds are
Why don`t I go where the clouds are
--- Unknown ---
I know about the leaves that fall and then are gone
How small a kite becomes with no one holding on
And I can`t be a cloud in a storm with no where to go to be warm
But as long as I can?t find a clue to the riddle of it
What am I to do in the middle of it all?
--- Unknown ---
I don`t belong where the crowds
I don`t belong where the clouds are
Then where do I belong?
