------ Thank Heaven for Little Girls ------
--- Lachaille ---
Each time I see a girl of five or six or seven
I can't resist the joyous urge to smile and say thank heaven for little girls
For little girls get bigger everyday!
Thank heaven for little girls
They grow up in the most delightful way
Those little eyes so helpless and appealing
One day will flash and send you crashing through the ceiling
Thank heaven for little girls
Thank heaven for them all no matter where no matter who
Without them, what would little boys do?
Thank heaven,
Thank heaven,
Thank heaven for little girls!
