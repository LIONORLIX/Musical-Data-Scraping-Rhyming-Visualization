------ A Parade in Town ------
--- CORA ---
Hi!... Hey!... Wait!... Voters!...
I see flags, I hear bells,
There's a parade in town.
I see crowds, I hear yells,
There's a parade in town!
I hear drums in the air,
I see clowns in the square,
I see marchers marching,
Tossing hats at the sky.
Did you hear? Did you see?
Is a parade in town?
Well, they're out of step, the flutes are squeaky,
The banners are frayed.
Any parade in town without me
Must be a second-class parade!
So!... Ha!...
--- BOTH GROUPS ---
Hapgood has no answers or suggestions,
Only a lot of questions.
We like questions!
What's the use of answers or suggestions?
As long as we're told where to go,
There isn't a thing we need to know!

There's a parade in town!
I hear drums in the air,
I see clowns in the square,
I see marchers marching,
Tossing hats at the sky.
Did you hear? Did you see?
Was a parade in town?
Were there drums without me?
Was a parade in town?
'Cause I'm dressed at last,
at my best, and my banners are high.
Tell me, while I was getting ready,
