There's water in a lake, water in a river,
Water in the deep blue sea.
But water in a rock - Lord! That's a miracle!
Who's got the miracle?
--- TOWNSPEOPLE ---
We!
--- ALL ---
There's water that you part,
Water that you walk on,
Water that you turn to wine!
But water from a rock - Lord!
What a miracle!
This is a miracle that's divine,
Truly divine!
--- CORA ---
Really divine!
--- TOWNSPEOPLE ---
The Lord said,
--- CORA ---
Let there be water!
--- TOWNSPEOPLE ---
The Lord said,
--- CORA ---
Turn on the front!
--- TOWNSPEOPLE ---
The Lord said,
--- CORA ---
Let there be Pilgrims,
And let them all think whatever they want.
--- TOWNSPEOPLE ---
Blessed be the child,
--- CORA ---
Blessed be the tourist,
--- TOWNSPEOPLE ---
Blessed it's its own reward,
Water is a boon, we'll soon be in clover!
--- CORA ---
Better issue stock, my rock runneth over!
