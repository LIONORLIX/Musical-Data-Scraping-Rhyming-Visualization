------ Tryouts ------

I remember my first tryout
And my second and third too
All the fear and holy hell the judges put me through
I felt so belittled
Man, they put me on the rack
And now that I'm a senior, this is my chance to give back
--- Unknown ---
I'll uphold the great tradition
With these young lives on my watch
Let's set the stage, I've come of age
To be a raging, castrating
