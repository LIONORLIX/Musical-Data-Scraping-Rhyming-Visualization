I'm a stud now, its clear.
So it'll shock you to hear
That i was a total dork
My freshman year --
--- Campbell ---
You?
--- Randall ---
Right?
I was a loser, a mess,
A loner, depressed
That every day i had to be me
Walked around hoping no one
Would see me
--- Unknown ---
I'd lock myself in the guys room
And let the tears fall,
Til one day this custodian
Knocked on my stall
And asked if i'd heard
Of the band
The grateful dead --
And i thought he might not be
Quite right in the head,
But he changed my life around
When he said
--- Unknown ---
"right now everything seems
So important,
But time rushes by at a clip
And when you look back,
These high school years
Will be nothing more than a blip
So you might as well -- enjoy
The trip.
--- Campbell ---
But its such a long blip!
--- Randall ---
Thats what i said! And he said:
--- Unknown ---
"trust me on this, when you're older
And wiser and balder and fatter
And you look back on this
Moment in time
The only things thats gonna
Matter is
Did you only do what you
Thought you should do?
Did you dance monkey dance
Cause the man told you to?
Or did you spend your time doing
What brings joy to you?
--- Unknown ---
"all you see is this dude
With a broom in his hand,
But i\'ve followed my dreams
And my favorite band.
--- Unknown ---
So dont sit on your ass
Waiting for life to begin
If you do what you love
With your time, then you win!
What a long, strange,
Wonderful trip it's been!
--- Unknown ---
Right now everything seems
So important
But time rushes by at a clip
And when you look back,
These high school years
Will be nothing more than a blip
Just a tale to tell!
--- Randall & campbell ---
That rings a bell
So what the hell!
We might as well enjoy the trip!
