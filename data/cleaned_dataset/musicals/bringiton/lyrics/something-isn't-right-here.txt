------ Something Isn't Right Here ------
--- Campbell (sang) ---
I put her on the team she was green as she could be,
I took a lot of heat no one wanted her but me,
All my dreams were coming true, i was captain it was cool,
Then im suddenly redist-... redis.. sent to another school,
So skylers next in line but somehow skyler flunks!
So kyler should be captain but kylers blowing chunks,
Is this all coninscidence to some related incident that happened to occur,
Miraculusly making way for her
--- Unknown ---
Something isnt right here, i dont know what it is, none of this should be happening ,
But it is, oh but it is, its like hearing a ticking sound coming from unmarked packages
--- Campbell(Spoken) ---
Hang on just one second, ill be right there.

She did it, she did it, she came up with a plan to take all that she took,
My team, my school, my man, next she\'ll win the lotto,
Or crap a four leaf clover, can i just eb me who sees how she screwed us over!
