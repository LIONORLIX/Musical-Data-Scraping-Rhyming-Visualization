Oh yeah
Well whoopee do you caught me, ok everything is true
I'll still wake up a winner, and you'll still wake up you
Go and judge me all you want, to ignore me in the halls
I just did what wished you could but you don't have the balls
Paint me as the villain, but by the time this ends,
I'll have the trophy in my hands and all you'll have is friends
You're all a bunch of losers, I'm here to represent
I'm dazzling, magnificent! I'm the one percent!!!
