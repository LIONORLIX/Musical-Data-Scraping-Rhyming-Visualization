------ Waiting For You ------
--- Ellie ---
A murmur on the hillside, a whisper through the trees
A message someone’s sending, a secret on the breeze
A voice that’s full of magic, a voice I’ve never heard.
A feeling, no, a knowing, I know it sounds absurd.
--- Unknown ---
A conversation in the air,
A story carried by the Sea.
A strange and unfamiliar language
That knows, yes it knows,
You’re coming back to me.
--- Unknown ---
My boy, you see, there’s a knowing inside of me.
A growing sense that soon you’ll return.
My boy, you see, there’s a voice here that’s guiding me.
My choice to wait, to listen & learn.
Makes no sense, don’t ask why,
Can’t explain, can’t even try.
I just know it’s true.
And when you do, I’ll be waiting,
Be waiting for you.
--- Mrs. D ---
People passing by can’t hear it, too busy rushing on.
Frowning, saying softly ‘Ellie, listen now, your boy has gone.’
--- But lately she’s heard better stories ---
Fairies whispering in her ear,
Singing songs that lift her heart.
She knows, yes she knows,
That soon, you’ll be near.
--- Unknown ---
Now boy, it’s true, feel the knowing inside of you.
A growing sense that soon you’ll return.
Now boy, it’s true, there’s a voice here that’s guiding you.
Your choice to wait, to listen & learn.
Makes no sense, don’t ask why,
Can’t explain, can’t even try,
But you know it’s true.
And when you do, she’ll be waiting,
Be waiting for you.
--- Ellie ---
The summer night seems quiet,
The truth is that’s a lie.
The whole world’s passing on
The news that you’re nearby.
--- Both ---
The Sea, the Stars, the Moonlight,
The Wind, the Trees, the Birds,
Humming, chanting, singing, shouting,
Can’t you hear their magic words’
--- Ellie ---
My boy, you see,
There’s a knowing inside of me.
A growing sense.
That soon you’ll return
My boy, you see,
There’s a voice here that’s guiding me.
My choice to wait,
To listen & learn.
Mrs. D:
My boy, you’ll see,
There’s a knowing,
A growing sense,
Soon you’ll return.
My boy, you’ll see,
There’s a voice here,
Her choice to wait,
Listen & learn.
Both:
Makes no sense, don’t ask why,
Can’t explain, can’t even try.
--- Ellie ---
I just know it’s true.
I’ll be waiting,
Be waiting for
Mrs. D:
And when you do
Waiting
--- Both ---
A murmur, a whisper, a secret,
A feeling that’s growing, a knowing.
Makes no sense, don’t ask why,
Can’t explain, can’t even try,
--- Ellie ---
I just know it’s true.
I’ll be waiting,
Be waiting for you.
I’ll be waiting for you.
Mrs. D:
And when you do,
Waiting,
For you,
For you.
