------ Happy Harvest ------

Come on along and take a ride
And look at life from the cheery side!

Howdy neighbor? Happy harvest!
May your forty acres soon be fields of clover!
Yes, indeed and plant a wish with every seed and by and by
The sun and rain will make an etching
Of a million little green fingers stretching to the sky

Howdy neighbor? Happy harvest!
Get your rocking chairs for all your cares are over
Clap your hands and lick your chops
Your bumper crops are on the climb
Hey we're gonna roll in plenty spend a 5 or 10 or 20
And those happy harvest bells are gonna chime
--- Unknown ---
Remember neighbor
When you work for Mother Nature
You get paid by Father Time
--- Unknown ---
Chicks are gonna cackle
And every burlap sack'll be full of 'tatoes and tobaccos
And dozens of different good and healthy greens
And if the weather man won't upset us
Mister you can bet us
They'll be lots of crispy lettuce in your jeans
If you're into livin' find out just what livin' means
--- Unknown ---
Howdy neighbor? Happy harvest!
May your forty acres soon be fields of clover
Go on puff your corn cob pipes
And no more gripes and no more groans
No mortgages or loans
And you won't see a trace of worrying
On the face of Farmer Jones
