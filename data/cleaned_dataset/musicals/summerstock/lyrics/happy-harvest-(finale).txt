(Howdy Neighbor)
--- Verse ---
--- Unknown ---
Oh, things are gonna jell
For the farmer in the dell
And how, and how!
Keep the roads a-clear,
It's a go to market year,
And how, and how!
There'll be a prosperous swish to the tail of ev'ry cow,
We'll sow and plow and hoe and how, how, how!
--- Chorus 1 ---
--- Unknown ---
Howdy neighbor, happy harvest,
May your forty acres soon be fields of clover!
Yes indeed 'n plant a wish with ev'ry seed 'n bye and bye,
The sun and rain will make an etching
Of a million little green fingers stretching to the sky.
Howdy neighbor, happy harvest!
Get your rocking chairs, for all your cares are over.
Clap your hands and lick your chops,
Your bumper crops are on the climb;
Hey! We're gonna roll in plenty,
Spend a five or ten or twenty,
And those happy harvest bells are gonna chime.
Remember, neighbor, when you work for Mother Nature,
You get paid by Father Time.

Howdy neighbor, happy harvest,
May your forty acres soon be fields of clover!
Yes indeed 'n plant a wish with ev'ry seed 'n bye and bye,
The sun and rain will make an etching
Of a million little green fingers stretching to the sky.
Howdy neighbor, happy harvest!
Get your rocking chairs, for all your cares are over.
Clap your hands and lick your chops,
Your bumper crops are on the climb;
And in crowded country chapels
Ev'ry farmer will be ???,
And those happy harvest bells are gonna chime.
Remember, neighbor, when you work for Mother Nature,
You get paid by Father Time.

Chicks are gonna cackle
And ev'ry burlap sack'll
Be full of 'taters and tobaccos,
And dozens of diff'rent young and healthy greens;
And if the weatherman won't upset us,
Mister, you can bet us,
There'll be lots of crispy lettuce in your jeans!
