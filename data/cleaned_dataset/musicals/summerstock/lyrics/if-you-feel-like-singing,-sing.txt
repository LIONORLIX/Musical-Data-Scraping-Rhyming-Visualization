------ If You Feel Like Singing, Sing ------
--- Unknown ---
If you feel like singing, sing,
Tra-la-la your cares away,
There's something about giving out with a song,,
Makes you belong,
Helps you to find a peace of mindful day.
If you feel like humming, hum,
Fiddle-dee dee da dee dum,
Supposin' you do-re-mi slightly off key,
Ev'ryone can't be a Bing,
Tell your friends to go places
If they start making faces
If you feel like singing, sing.
If you feel like singing, sing,
Tra-la-la your cares away,
There's something about giving out with a song,,
Makes you belong,
Helps you to find a peace of mindful day.
If you feel like humming, hum,
Fiddle-dee dee da dee dum,
Just look in the mirror and do a duet,
And raise your voices aloft.
Don't move out of your dwelling
If your neighbors start yelling,
If you can't sing good, sing soft.
La-dee-da, la-dee-da,
When your luck is in need of repair,
La-dee-da, don't you care?
Where you are or what time it is
Whose tune or whose rhyme it is,
It mustn't necessarily be any anniversary
Or be an extra-special event,
If you feel like singing, sing,
Tra-la-la, fiddle-dee, la-dee-da
Sing to your heart's content.

La-dee-da, la-dee-da,
Toss that note in your throat in the air,
La-dee-da, don't you care,
Anyone who feels chipper will
Chirp out like a whippoorwill,
It mustn't necessarily be any anniversary
Or be an extra-special event,
If you feel like singing, sing,
Tra-la-la, fiddle-dee, la-dee-da
