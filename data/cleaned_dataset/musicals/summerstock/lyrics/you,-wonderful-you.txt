------ You, Wonderful You ------
--- Unknown ---
I'm glad I met you
You wonderful you
I can't forget you
You wonderful you
You're like a breath of spring
A whole new thing that's happened
And without much adue
I look at you and
There stands love
My arms around you
That's wonderful too
So glad I found you
You wonderful you
Remember
Finders' keepers
Loosers weepers
And because it's true
You're mine now
