------ Friendly Star ------
--- Unknown ---
There's a star for everyone
Brightly shining in the sky
It seems to be a part of our destiny
--- Unknown ---
Ev'ry night I eagerly,
Watch them all go twinkling by
But I can't seem to find the one the heavens
Assigned to me...
--- Unknown ---
Friendly star, where could you be hiding
Smile for me from out of the lonely night
Friendly star, my fate needs deciding
How I need the glow of your guiding light
--- Unknown ---
I know that you are near, for I am strangely dreamy
And so if you can see me from afar
Won't you kindly, light my way
--- Unknown ---
Lead me to my lover, Just point him out, And whisper,
there you are, there you are
Then my love, you will be
Standing here, close to me
