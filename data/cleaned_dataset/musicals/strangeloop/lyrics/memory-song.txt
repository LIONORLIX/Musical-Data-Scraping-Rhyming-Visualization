------ Memory Song ------
--- USHER ---
Five foot four, high school gym
Sneaking a cupcake
These are my memories
These are my memories
--- Unknown ---
Shooting hoops?off?the rim
Slow on?the uptake
These are my memories
These are?my memories
After gym, the locker room, my eyes photographing
Naked me measures in a four and a half inches
These are my memories
These are my memories
Of one lone black gay boy I knew who chose to turn his back on the Lord
One lone black gay boy I knew who chose to turn his back on the Lord
--- Unknown ---
Guilt and shame, Jesus's name
Church every Sunday
These are my memories
These are my memories
Eat His body, drink His blood
Communion buffet
These are my memories
Sweet, sour memories
--- Unknown ---
After church we're driving home to radio crackle
Jazz, muzak or Motown blues and skin is a shackle
For one lone black gay boy I knew who chose to turn his back on the Lord
One lone black gay boy I knew who chose to turn his back on the Lord
--- Unknown ---
These are my memories
Sweet, sour memories
This is my history
This is my mystery
[THOUGHTS]
Hmm...
--- USHER ---
Mom is napping on the couch, and dad cuts the grass
While I watch TV all day long, Young & the Restless
Like one lone black gay boy I knew who chose to turn his back on the Lord
One lone black gay boy I knew who chose to turn his back on the Lord
--- Unknown ---
Dad is drunk and on the couch while mom eats a pork chop
Daily bread mill, daily treadmill won't ever stop
One lone black gay boy I knew who chose to turn his back on the Lord
One lone black gay boy I knew who chose to turn his back on the Lord
--- Unknown ---
I am lying on the couch, I dream that I'm flying
Flapping both my wings so hard to keep me from dying
With a crown of godforsaken thorns on my head
Like all those black gay boys I knew who chose to go on back to the Lord
And all those black gay boys I knew who chose to go on back to the Lord
All those black gay boys I knew who chose to go on back to the Lord
--- Unknown ---
I'm one of those black gay boys I knew who chose to turn his back on the Lord
