Usher's walk of shame from Inwood takes him deeper into a strange loop, which is?precisely?the moment he?gets his annual birthday voicemail from?Mom.
--- MOM ---
I just like to remind you
Periodically
That I love you son
If you ever should find you
Need encouragement
Then you call me, son
I am your mama, and I've always loved you
Even when you be doing me wrong
I went through labor, hours of labor
To bring you along
--- Unknown ---
And you mean all the world to me
You mean all the world to me
You're the reason I'm singing this song
--- Unknown ---
This is the day, this is the day
This is the day that the Lord has made, that the Lord has made
He has a milestone in my baby's life
You turn 26 on the 26th
And this will never happen again
So, enjoy your day!
--- Unknown ---
(spoken)
You were born at 8:31 this morning, my love! Ma loves you! You turn 26 on the 26th! I hope I'm the first one to call you, but even if I'm not, with the exception of our dear Heavenly Father, I am the one that loves you the most!
--- Unknown ---
(sung)
I just like to remind you
Periodically
Read your Bible, son
Don't put Jesus behind you
Periodically
Read your Bible, son!
One: Honor thy father and thy mother
That thy days on the earth will be long
Two: Be encouraged, ye may feel helpless
But Jesus is strong
And three, and most importantly, most importantly
It's the reason I'm singing this song
--- Unknown ---
(spoken)
Listen on me, now
--- Unknown ---
(sung)
Man is for woman
And woman for man
The rest is confusion
And not in God's plan
--- Unknown ---
All of these Hollywood homosexuals
Wavin' gay flags all day and night
Stickin' their things up each other's buttholes
I'm tellin' you, son, that it just ain't right!
--- Unknown ---
It ain't right, it ain't right, it ain't right with God!
It ain't right, it ain't right, it ain't right with me!
And I just need to call up my baby boy
And remind him of that periodically
[MA & USHER]
Cause I love you
And I don't want your soul to be wasted
It hurts me so bad sometimes I can taste it
Hell is real
Sinners burnin'
Sinners churnin' in rivers of fire
Because of filthy, unholy desire
--- Unknown ---
Hell is real
Though we love you
Don't repent cause you know it would please us
Son, you should do it so you can see Jesus
--- Unknown ---
He is real
And He loves you
And He don't want your soul to be wasted
Because the pain of the world, he done faced it
--- Unknown ---
He is real
And I love Him
So despite all my pain and my strife, I'll
Just keep on praying your reprobate lifestyle
