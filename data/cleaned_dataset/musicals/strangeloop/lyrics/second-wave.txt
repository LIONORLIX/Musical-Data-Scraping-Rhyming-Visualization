------ Second Wave ------
--- USHER ---
I don't have AIDS
And I don't care about marriage
And I will never be pushing
A loud-ass?baby?around in a?carriage
--- Unknown ---
No, I'll just walk around with?a scowl on my face
Like I'm Betty Friedan
Because the second wave feminist in me
Is at war with the dick-sucking black gay man
Who's not looking for now
As much as fifteen years later
And so the Grindr crowd
Turns me into a chronic stay-at-home masturbator
--- Unknown ---
When I wanna go out on a Saturday night
I don't feel that I can
Because the second wave feminist in me
Is at war with the dick-sucking black gay man
--- Unknown ---
So I fall outside of the norm
Cause I burn my bra to keep warm
While most of my brethren swarm
To Beyonce and Rihanna
And bareback and felching and so on
--- Unknown ---
But they won't get AIDS
Cause now they're taking Truvada
And I don't know what to say
So I stay in my corner, and I just say nada
--- Unknown ---
And watch them all do what they want
Without fear, without having a plan
Meanwhile, the second wave feminist in me
Is at war with the dick-sucking black gay man
So nobody cums on my chest
And I come off sounding repressed
But maybe that's all for the best
If I want something deeper
And someone who thinks I'm a keeper
--- Unknown ---
And who can understand
My long hesitation
And who will take my hand
And help me undo this polarization
--- Unknown ---
And lets me curl up with Charlene, Mary-Jo, Julia and Suzanne
Until the second wave feminist in me
