--- INWOOD DADDY, spoken ---
Usher! Jesus, it sure took you long enough. It's almost midnight!
--- USHER, spoken ---
Sorry, the MTA sucks, and?Inwood?is never as?easy to navigate as I think?it's gonna be
--- INWOOD DADDY, spoken ---
It's fine, beggars can't be choosers or complainers, and who knows the next time I'll be able to get away from my wife or one of my little New York City rendezvous like this? So, let's get this party started
--- USHER ---
I always say I plan to change my life today
But the only thing I ever seem to do
Is write a song, is write a song, is write a song
But tonight, I get attracted to-
[THOUGHTS]
Inwood Daddy, sucking cock all Saturday morning
Inwood Daddy, sucking cock all Saturday morning
--- USHER ---
He posted-
--- INWOOD DADDY ---
It's my guarantee you'll have the time of your life, bro!
Wanna give out some dick I don't even give to my wife, so
All blacks and latinos to the front of the line
If you give me that fat bubble butt, I'll treat it just like a shrine!
--- Unknown ---
(spoken)
How old are you?
--- USHER, spoken ---
Twenty-five, I turn twenty-six tomorrow, actually
--- INWOOD DADDY, spoken ---
Well, let's get you into that birthday suit so we can celebrate then, big guy
--- USHER ---
I always say I plan to change my life today
And that's exactly what I'm about to do
But is it wrong? And am I wrong? Is it wrong?
Am I wrong to be attracted to
The white, male indifference crossed with fetishization
Which is easy to do when you're feeling such desperation?
Cause you're just a dumb monkey, and the pain of it haunts you
[THOUGHTS]
So just do what he says
Because at least someone wants you
--- Unknown ---
(underneath INWOOD DADDY and USHER's dialogue)
White, white, white, white...
--- INWOOD DADDY, spoken ---
You, uh, like my white cock in your ass, don't you, nigga?
--- USHER, spoken ---
Yes, I want it
--- INWOOD DADDY, spoken ---
The niggers always love it when I give them a little police brutality up their ol' Hershey highway!
--- Unknown ---
(USHER gasps as INWOOD DADDY enters him)
--- Unknown ---
Open up for me, blackie! Open up for me
--- USHER, spoken ---
Fuck me (???)
--- INWOOD DADDY, spoken ---
Oh, Kunta Kinte, those aren't tears in your eyes, are they?
[USHER, spoken]
No!
--- INWOOD DADDY, spoken ---
Is Massa making you cwy?
--- USHER, spoken ---
No
--- INWOOD DADDY, spoken ---
Good, cause I like it rough, and now Massa's gonna fuck you until you learn to be a good little boy! Take my dick, take my dick, take my dick!
--- USHER ---
It's the only thing I ever seem to do
It's the only thing I ever seem to do
It's the only thing I ever seem to do
It's the only thing I ever seem to do
Being his nigga
