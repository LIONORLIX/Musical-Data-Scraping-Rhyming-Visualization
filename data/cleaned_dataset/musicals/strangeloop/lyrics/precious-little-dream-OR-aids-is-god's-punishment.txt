------ Precious Little Dream / AIDS Is God's Punishment ------
--- MOM, spoken ---
Why do you hate us?
--- USHER, spoken ---
I don't hate you
--- MOM, spoken ---
Gettin' up in front of all of these?people?and showing them?how much you hate us!
--- USHER, spoken ---
Mom, I?don't hate you. I don't hate you!
[MOM, spoken]
Then why would you write about us like this?
--- USHER, spoken ---
Because I love you!
--- MOM, spoken ---
You don't love me. If you loved me, you wouldn't have made your daddy run out of here with tears in his eyes. If you loved me, you would've found you a church home in New York. If you loved me, you would've brought me home a daughter-in-law and a grandbaby by now! If you loved me, you'd be able to fly me around the world like Tyler Perry!
--- THOUGHTS ---
Her precious little dream
--- MOM, spoken ---
But oh, no, you are frightened about life
--- THOUGHTS ---
Came tumbling down
--- MOM, spoken ---
Never mind Doodoo Bank Student Loans calling my house, looking for your black butt
--- THOUGHTS ---
After all the time she spent building it up
--- MOM, spoken ---
Just lollygagging there in New York, ain't doin' nothin'!
[THOUGHTS]
And after all of the things that she's been through
--- MOM, spoken ---
Probably up there dressin' and pretendin' like you was a white woman!
--- THOUGHTS ---
You come along and crush it
--- MOM, spoken ---
Talking 'bout you want a black man, hah!
--- THOUGHTS ---
In the palm of your hand
--- MOM, spoken ---
Like a real black man would want to kiss you!
--- THOUGHTS ---
The Bible says homosexuality is worse than murder!
--- THOUGHTS ---
Flush it
Down...
--- MOM ---
My precious little dream
[USHER, spoken]
It never ends with you
--- MOM ---
My little boy
--- USHER, spoken ---
(???) repeat, repeat, repeat
--- Unknown ---
(sung)
God, after all this time
Why can't you give it up?
--- MOM, spoken ---
Oh no, you not gonna turn this on me, I know I'm a good mama!
--- USHER ---
Cause if you knew all the things that I've been through
--- MOM, spoken ---
They had to cut me open to get you, did you know that? I bled and bled to get your black butt out of my stomach!
--- USHER ---
You'd rue the ways you attack me
--- MOM, spoken ---
You said your homosexuality was just a phase
--- USHER ---
You'd rue the ways you fought
--- MOM, spoken ---
But you're 26 years old, and you still kissing on men!
--- USHER ---
You run until you've tracked me down
--- MOM, spoken ---
Why couldn't you just be the daughter I always wanted? I'll tell you why, it's because you're selfish!
--- USHER ---
Mama, I can't suck your titties again
I can't crawl back up inside your womb
--- MOM, spoken ---
Your nasty little mouth
--- USHER ---
You wonder why it's like a graveyard
In your living room
--- MOM, spoken ---
And all I can do is cry
--- USHER ---
You wanna cry, Mama?
Go right ahead
--- MOM, spoken ---
My stumps are growing short on this earth, son
--- USHER ---
But I won't cry, Mama
Cause I'm not dead
--- MOM, spoken ---
And one day, you won't have me at all
--- USHER ---
And you're not dead!
--- MOM, spoken ---
Then you'll be all alone!
--- USHER ---
Time just has this way of tearing
Down the dreams we think we live in
Spinning wheels and motor [?]
So effed up and so run down
An overblown and false display
Just like in a gospel play!
--- ANCESTORS ---
Who the fuck is you, nigga?
Who the fuck is you?
Ooh...
Ooh...
--- PREACHER, spoken ---
Sister Serabe, the Lord done put it on my heart to sing this selection in honor of Brother Darnell, who was an abomination just like me. And I can't help but reflect on your husband's words to me at the age of seventeen, that if I ever acted on my lust for another man, that I would meet the same fate as Darnell, lying in that there box. And those words have kept me HIV-free but completely terrified ever since, because I realized then and there that the only thing worse than dying of AIDS was living with it, and hearing the people you love most say I told you so, I told you so, I told you so! Can I get a witness out there, choir?
--- CHOIR, spoken ---
Yas!
--- PREACHER, spoken ---
And so, on today, as we prepare to bury yet another un-HBO special, un-Oscar Award winning, abnormal-hearted, un-Angel in American black queer in the ground, it is very important that we remember what God's word, your word, Tyler's word, and every-fucking-body else's word tells us:
--- USHER ---
AIDS is God's punishment
--- PREACHER, spoken ---
Sing your song, brother, sing your song
--- USHER ---
For the man who ain't living right
--- THOUGHT, spoken ---
You hear that, Curtis?
--- USHER ---
AIDS is God's punishment
--- THOUGHT, spoken ---
I love the Lord, you heard my piety and pity's ever-growing
--- USHER ---
For he who sins in the night
--- THOUGHT, spoken ---
Let 'em know, let 'em know, let 'em know!
--- USHER ---
AIDS is God's punishment
But all darkness (all darkness), all darkness (all darkness), all darkness (all darkness) comes to light
--- THOUGHT, spoken ---
Speak on it!
--- USHER ---
He gonna knock them dicks up out your mouth
And then, (spoken) and this is what I like about him
Di-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-di
He shall smite
Cause-
