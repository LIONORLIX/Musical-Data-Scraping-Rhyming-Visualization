------ The Coming of The Dawn ------
--- Frankenstein ---
--- Unknown ---
I have searched across the years
for a glimpse beyond the tears.
Not caring once for those I left behind.
--- Unknown ---
Having strayed so far from home
I deserve to stand alone
While I chase the secrets of the night
I never saw the beauty in the light!
--- Unknown ---
The sun that never rose
the dawn that never came!
My morning has deserted me
with no one left but me to blame!
--- Unknown ---
None are blind as those who will not see
And now the light is here
and everything is clear,
but now I fear the coming of the dawn
has come too late for me.
--- Unknown ---
In the theatre of my mind,
though the shadows intertwine
it seemed my every step was strong and true
and I acted just for me
on my stage of fantasy
for no one fears the morning's gentle beams
except the fool who lives inside his dreams!
--- Unknown ---
The sun that never rose
the dawn that never came
my morning has deserted me
to bear the darkness of my shame
reaching for tomorrow
I have lost today.
And now that all that's gray
is fading into day
I only pray the coming of the dawn
has come to light the way!
--- Unknown ---
Is this the great discovery
for which I've waited?
Is this how a man is truly created?
--- Unknown ---
A sun that never rose
the dawn that never came
Why do the things we have seem precious
only once they've slipped away?
Dreams of glory have their price to pay
But far beyond the night
Lie promises of light
and maybe with the coming of the dawn
there comes another day!
--- Unknown ---
Maybe with the coming of the dawn
