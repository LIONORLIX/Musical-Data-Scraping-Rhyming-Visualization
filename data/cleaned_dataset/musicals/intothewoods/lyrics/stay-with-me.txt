------ Stay With Me ------
--- WITCH ---
What did I clearly say?
Children must listen.
--- RAPUNZEL ---
No, no, please!
--- WITCH ---
What were you not to do?
Childrem must see-
--- RAPUNZEL ---
No!
--- WITCH ---
And learn.
--- Unknown ---
Why could you not obey?
Children should listen.
What have I been to you?
What would you have me be?
Handsome like a Prince?
--- Unknown ---
Ah, but I am old.
I am ugly.
I embarass you.
--- RAPUNZEL ---
No!
--- WITCH ---
You are ashamed of me.
--- RAPUNZEL ---
No!
--- WITCH ---
You are ashamed.
You don't understand.
--- RAPUNZEL ---
It was lonely atop that tower.
--- WITCH ---
I was not company enough?
--- RAPUNZEL ---
I am no longer a child. I wish to see the world.
--- WITCH ---
Don't you know what's out there in the world?
Someone has to shield you from the world.
Stay with me.
--- Unknown ---
Princes wait there in the world, it's true.
Princes, yes, but wolves and humans, too.
Stay at home.
I am home.
--- Unknown ---
Who out there could love you more than I?
What out there that I cannot supply?
Stay with me.
--- Unknown ---
Stay with me,
The world is dark and wild.
Stay a child while you can be a child.
