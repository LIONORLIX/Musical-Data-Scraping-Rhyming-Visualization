------ It Takes Two ------
--- BAKER'S WIFE ---
You've changed.
You're daring.
You're different in the woods.
More sure.
More sharing.
You're getting us through the woods.
--- Unknown ---
If you could see-
You're not the man who started,
And much more openhearted
Than I knew
You to be.
--- BAKER ---
It takes two.
I thought one was enough,
It's not true:
It takes two of us
You came through
When the journey was rough.
It took you.
It took two of us.
--- Unknown ---
It takes care.
It takes patience and fear and despair
To change.
Though you swear
To change,
Who can tell if you do?
It takes two.
--- BAKER'S WIFE ---
You've changed.
You're thriving.
There's something about the woods.
Not just
Surviving.
You're blossoming in the woods.
--- Unknown ---
At home I'd fear
We'd stay the same forever.
And then out here-
You're passionate
Charming,
Considerate,
Clever-
--- BAKER ---
It takes one
To begin, but then once
You've begun,
It takes two of you.
--- Unknown ---
It's no fun,
But what needs to be done
You can do
When there's two of you.
--- Unknown ---
If I dare,
It's because I'm becoming
Aware of us
As a pair of us,
Each accepting a share
Of what's there.
--- BOTH ---
We've changed.
We're strangers.
I'm meeting you in the woods.
Who minds
What dangers?
I know we'll get past the woods.
And once we're past,
Lets' hope the changes last
--- Unknown ---
Beyond woods,
Beyond witches and slippers and hoods,
Just the two of us-
Beyond lies,
Safe at home with our beautiful prize,
Just the few of us.
--- Unknown ---
It takes trust.
It takes just
A bit more
And we're done.
We want four,
We had none.
We've got three.
We need one.
