------ Agony (Reprise) ------
--- Unknown ---
[CINDERELLA'S PRINCE
High in a tower-
Like yours was, but higher-
A beauty asleep.
All round the tower
A thicket of briar
A hundred feet deep.
--- Unknown ---
Agony!
No frustration mor keen,
When the one thing you want
Is a thing that you've not even seen.
--- Unknown ---
RAPUNZEL'S PRINCE
I found a casket
Entirely of glass-
No, it's unbreakable.
Inside- don't ask it-
A maiden, alas,
Just as unwakable-
--- BOTH ---
What unmistakable agony!
Is the way always barred?
--- Unknown ---
RAPUNZEL'S PRINCE
She has skin white as snow-
--- Unknown ---
CINDERELLA'S PRINCE
Did you learn her name?
--- Unknown ---
RAPUNZEL'S PRINCE
No,
There's a dwarf standing guard.
--- BOTH ---
Agony!
Such that Princes must weep!
Always in thrall most
To anything almost,
Or something asleep.
--- Unknown ---
CINDERELLA'S PRINCE
If it were not for the thicket-
--- Unknown ---
RAPUNZEL'S PRINCE
A thicket's no trick.
Is it thick?
--- Unknown ---
CINDERELLA'S PRINCE
It's the thickest.
--- Unknown ---
RAPUNZEL'S PRINCE
The quickest
Is pick it
Apart with a stick-
--- Unknown ---
CINDERELLA'S PRINCE
yes, but even one prick-
It's my thing about blood.
--- Unknown ---
RAPUNZEL'S PRINCE
Well, it's sick!
--- Unknown ---
CINDERELLA'S PRINCE
It's no sicker
Than you thing with dwarves.
--- Unknown ---
RAPUNZEL'S PRINCE
Dwarfs.
--- Unknown ---
CINDERELLA'S PRINCE
Dwarfs...
--- Unknown ---
RAPUNZEL'S PRINCE
Dwarfs are every upsetting.
--- BOTH ---
Not forgetting
The tasks unacheivable,
Mountains unscalable-
If it's conceivable
But unavailable,
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh-
--- Unknown ---
Agony!
--- Unknown ---
CINDERELLA'S PRINCE
Misery!
--- BOTH ---
Not to know what you miss.
--- Unknown ---
CINDERELLA'S PRINCE
While they lie there for years-
--- Unknown ---
RAPUNZEL'S PRINCE
And you cry on their biers-
--- BOTH ---
What unbearable bliss!
Agony
That can cut like a knife!
