------ Lament ------
--- WITCH ---
This is the world I meant.
Couldn't you listen?
Couldn't you stay content,
Safe behind walls,
As I
Could not?
--- Unknown ---
Now you know what's out there in the world.
No one can prepare you for the world,
Even I.
How could I, who loved you as you were?
How could I have shielded you from her
Or them...
--- Unknown ---
No matter what you say,
Children won't listen.
No matter what you know,
Children refuse
To learn.
--- Unknown ---
Guide them along the way,
Still they won't listen.
Children can only grow
From something you love
To something you lose...
