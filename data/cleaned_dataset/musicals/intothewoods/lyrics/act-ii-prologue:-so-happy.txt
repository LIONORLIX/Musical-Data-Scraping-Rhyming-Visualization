Always thinking of yourself! Look at my garden.

Destroyed!

Into the woods,
It's always when
You think at last
You're through, and then
Into the woods you go again
To take another journey
--- Unknown ---

Into the woods,
The weather's clear,
We've been before,
We've naught to fear...
Into the woods, away from here-

Into the woods,
The path is straight,
No reason then
To hesitate-

BAKER'S WIFE
Into the woods,
It's not to late,
It's just another journey...

But not too long:
The skies are strange,
The winds are strong.
Into the woods to see what's wrong...
--- JACK ---
Into the woods-
To slay the giant!
