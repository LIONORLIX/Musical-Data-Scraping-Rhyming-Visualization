------ Do I Hear A Waltz? ------
--- Unknown ---
Do I hear a waltz?
Very odd, but I hear a voice.
There isn't a band
And I don't understand it at all.
I can't hear a waltz,
Oh, my Lord, there it goes again!
Why is nobody dancing in the street?
Can't they hear the beat?
Magical, mystical, miracle,
Can it be?
Is it true?
Things are imposibly lyrical.
Is it me?
No, it's you!
I do hear a waltz
I see you and I hear a waltz!
It's what I've been waiting for all my life to hear a waltz!

Do I hear a waltz?
Oh, my dear, don't you hear a waltz?
Such love Blue Danubey music,
How can you be still?
You must hear a waltz!
Even strangers are dancing now:
An old lady is waltzing in her flat,
Waltzing with her cat.
Roses are dancing with peonies.
Yes, it's true!
Don't you see?
Ev'rything's suddenly Vienese,
Can't be you!
Must be me!
Do I hear a waltz?
I want more than to hear a waltz:
I want you to share it 'cause
