------ What Do We Do? We Fly! ------
--- EDITH ---
Lloyd tells me:
Never go by plane.
I tell Lloyd:
Flying is insane.
We agree
We would rather die.
We see a brochure
And sign for a tour,
And what do we do? We fly!
--- Unknown ---
It starts the minute you check in,
Departure time is at noon,
A cup of tea and a schnecken,
And quick, it's leaving soon!
One o'clock and you're at the gate,
Two o'clock and the flight's still late,
When you finally leave, it's eight,
And what do we do? We fly!
--- LLOYD ---
We fly!
--- EDITH ---
What do we do? We fly!

| EDITH
| I hate planes,
| Sitting three abreast.
| I hate planes,
| Never get a rest.
| I hate planes.
|
| LEONA
| I agree.
| You're like me.
| I do too.
| What about you?
--- LLOYD ---
I hate
Every single one.
The crossing was rough,
Which wasn't enough,
The fun hadn't yet begun.
--- Unknown ---
The seat was throwing my back out,
But there I was with a book,
When suddenly there's a blackout
And everywhere I look
Is a close-up of Doris Day,
Ninety minutes of Doris Day,
There was nothing to do but pray,
And how do we go? We fly!
Why?
How do we go? We fly!
--- Unknown ---
| LLOYD, EDITH
| I hate planes,
| Most of all the sound.
| I hate planes,
| Even on the ground.
| Can't stand planes.
|
| LEONA
| I agree.
| You're like me.
| Have a drink.
| What do you think?
--- JENNIFER ---
I hate
Even more than those,
The kids in the aisle
Surrounding you while
Their parents pretend to doze!
--- Unknown ---
The kid I noticed the first was
The one who stood on my feet.
The kid I hated the worst was
The one who kicked my seat.
There was one on the right who spit,
There was one on the left who bit,
There was one in the back I hit,
But what did we do? We flew!
Ooh!
What did we do? We flew!

| EDITH, LLOYD, JENNIFER
| I hate planes,
| Most of all the sound.
| I hate planes,
| Even on the ground.
| Can't stand planes.

| LEONA
| I agree.
| You're like me.
| I'm that way.
| What do you say?
--- EDDIE ---
I hate
Most of all the chow.
To know what is what
Is difficult, but
I think I've discovered how.
--- Unknown ---
The shiny stuff is tomatoes,
The salad lies in a group,
The curly stuff is potatoes,
The stuff that moves is soup.
Anything that is white is sweet,
Anything that is brown is meat,
Anything that is grey, don't eat,
But what do we do? We fly!
Why?
What do we do? We fly!
--- ALL ---
You're zooming up like a comet,
Your ears are starting to ring,
Your neighbor's starting to vomit,
There's ice along the wing.
As you wait for your palms to dry,
You can see your whole life pass by,
And they tell you it's fun to fly!
Your chance of survival's so remote,
You're far better off to cut your throat,
But who has the time to take a boat?
