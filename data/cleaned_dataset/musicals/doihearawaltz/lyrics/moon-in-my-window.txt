------ Moon In My Window ------
--- JENNIFER ---
Moon in my window,
See that little dome?
By the time you reach it,
Eddie will be home.
Moon in my window,
Play this little game:
By the time he's reached me,
Things will be the same.
Moon, take heart and take pity,
Shine and change the scene,
Shine and wash the city
Clean.
Moon in my window,
Passing by that dome,
When you reach that cloud there,
He'll be home.
--- FIORIA ---
Moon in my window,
I am not impressed.
Waken other lovers,
Let me have my rest.
Moon in my window,
Make the lovers smile,
Let them have their dreamings
For this little while.
Glow, pass by and diminish,
So romantic moon.
All adventures finish
Soon.
Moon in my window,
It is getting late.
You'll be back tomorrow;
I can wait.
--- LEONA ---
Moon in my window,
How are you so bright?
Guess I've never seen you,
Not before tonight.
Moon in my window,
Going by so slow,
Are you giving lessons?
Thank you, but I know.
--- LEONA, JENNIFER ---
Moon, your light can be blinding,
But the night will end.
I don't need reminding,
Friend.
--- LEONA, JENNIFER, FIORIA ---
Moon in my window,
As you disappear,
Come again tomorrow,
I'll be here.
--- JENNIFER ---
Oh, moon!
--- FIORIA ---
Ah, moon!
--- LEONA ---
