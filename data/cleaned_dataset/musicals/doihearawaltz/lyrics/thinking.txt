LEONA: What are you thinking?
--- RENATO ---
I was thinking,
All of that Puccini
Going to waste.
--- LEONA ---
I was thinking,
Coffee and Puccini
Isn't my taste.
--- Unknown ---
(Pause)
--- RENATO ---
I keep thinking,
Such a fine beginning,
Such a lovely evening we could spend.
--- LEONA ---
Such a fine beginning,
I keep thinking
More about the end.
--- Unknown ---
(Pause)
--- Unknown ---
I was thinking,
Wonder what he's thinking?
Not what he should.
--- RENATO ---
I was thinking,
All this heavy thinking,
This is not good.
--- Unknown ---
(Pause)
--- Unknown ---
But think of coffee cups clinking
To a duet,
We could sit drinking,
See the sun set.
What are you thinking?
--- LEONA ---
I was just thinking,
What you are thinking, forget!
--- Unknown ---
(Pause)
--- Unknown ---
I was thinking,
Tete-a-tetes for two
So often fall flat.
--- RENATO ---
I was thinking,
Tete-a-tetes for one
Are flatter than that.
--- Unknown ---
(Pause)
--- Unknown ---
I am thinking,
This is very awkward,
Frankly, you prefer that I should go?
--- LEONA ---
This is very awkward,
I am thinking,
Very frankly, no!
--- Unknown ---
(Pause)
--- Unknown ---
I was thinking,
Wonder why I get
So easily hurt?
--- RENATO ---
I was thinking,
Has she noticed yet
The spot on my shirt?
--- Unknown ---
(Pause)
--- Unknown ---
But think of two of us linking
Arms in the square,
Sit as stars, winking,
Fill the night air.
What are you thinking?
--- LEONA ---
I was just thinking,
What am I going to wear?
--- RENATO ---
And as the sun begins sinking,
Night starts to fall,
--- LEONA ---
Stars appear blinking,
Gondoliers call,
--- RENATO, LEONA ---
What am I thinking?
I should be thinking
Not what I'm thinking
