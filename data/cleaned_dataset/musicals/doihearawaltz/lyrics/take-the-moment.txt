------ Take The Moment ------
--- RENATO ---
Take the moment,
Let it happen,
Hug the moment,
Make it last.
Hold the feeling
For the moment
Or the moment
Will have passed.
All the noises
Buzzing in your head,
Warning you to wait,
What for?
Don't listen!
Let it happen,
Take the moment,
Make the moment
Many moments more!
