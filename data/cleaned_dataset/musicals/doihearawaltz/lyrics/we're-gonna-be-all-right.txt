------ We're Gonna Be All Right ------
--- EDDIE ---
It may not all be bliss,
But every wound is treatable.
We won't go under,
We're gonna be all right.
Don't see how we can miss,
Our team is undefeatable.
I wouldn't wonder,
We're gonna be all right.
We may have had
Unhappy landings,
Misunderstandings,
We're still growing.
Some years are bad,
We're hale and hearty,
We'll keep the party
Going.
Hey, babe, let's have a kiss,
Remember, we're unbeatable.
We're gonna blunder,
We're gonna hold on tight,
Heigh-ho,
We're gonna be all right.
