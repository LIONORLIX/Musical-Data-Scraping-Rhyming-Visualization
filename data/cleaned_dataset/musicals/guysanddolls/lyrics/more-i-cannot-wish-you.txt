------ More I Cannot Wish You ------
--- Unknown ---
Velvet I can wish you
For the collar of your coat
And fortune smiling all along your way
But More I Cannot Wish You
Than to wish you find your love
Your own true love this day
--- Unknown ---
Mansions I can wish you
Seven footmen all in red
And calling cards upon a silver tray.
But More I Cannot Wish You
Than to wish you find your love
Your own true love this day
--- Unknown ---
Standing there
Gazing at you
Full of the bloom of youth
--- Unknown ---
Standing there
Gazing at you
With a sheep's eye
And a licorice tooth.
--- Unknown ---
Music I can wish you
Merry music while you're young
And wisdom when your hair has turned to gray.
But More I Cannot Wish You
Than to wish you find your love
Your own true love this day
With a sheep's eye
And a licorice tooth
And a strong arms
------ fin ------
