------ Adelaide's Lament (Reprise) ------
--- Unknown ---
In other words
Just from sitting alone at a table reserved for two
A person can develop the flu.
You can bundle her up in her woolies
And I mean the warmest friend
You can wrap her in sweaters and coats
Till its more than her brain can stand
If she still gets the feeling she's naked
From looking at her left hand
A person can develop the flu, the flu
A hundred and three point two
So much virus inside
That her microscope slide
Looks like a day at the zoo
Just from wanting her memories in writing
And a story her folks can be told
