------ I've Never Been in Love Before ------
--- Unknown ---
I've never been in love before
Now all at once it's you
It's you forever more.
--- Unknown ---
I've never been in love before
I thought my heart was safe
I thought I knew the score
But this is wine that's all too strange and strong
I'm full of foolish song
And out my song must pour
So please forgive this helpless haze I'm in
I've really never been
In love before.
