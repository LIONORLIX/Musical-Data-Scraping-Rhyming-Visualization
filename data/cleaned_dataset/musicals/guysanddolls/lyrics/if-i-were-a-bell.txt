------ If I Were a Bell ------
--- Unknown ---
Ask me how do I feel
Ask me now that we're cosy and clinging
Well sir, all I can say, is if I were a bell I'd be ringing!
--- Unknown ---
From the moment we kissed tonight
That's the way I've just gotta behave
Boy, if I were a lamp I'd light
And If I were a banner I'd wave!
--- Unknown ---
Ask me how do I feel, little me with my quiet upbringing
Well sir, all I can say is if gate I'd be swinging!
And if I were a watch I'd start popping my springs!
Or if I were a bell I'd go ding dong, ding dong ding!
--- Unknown ---
Ask me how do I feel from this chemistry lesson I'm learning.
--- Unknown ---
SKY (spoken) Uh, chemistry?
SARAH (spoken) Yes, chemistry!
--- Unknown ---
Well sir, all I can say is if I were a bridge I'd be burning!
--- Unknown ---
Yes, I knew my moral would crack
From the wonderful way that you looked!
Boy, if I were a duck I'd quack!
Or if I were a goose I'd be cooked!
--- Unknown ---
Ask me how do I feel, ask me now that we're fondly caressing
Well, if I were a salad I know I'd be splashing my dressing
Ask me how to describe this whole beautiful thing
