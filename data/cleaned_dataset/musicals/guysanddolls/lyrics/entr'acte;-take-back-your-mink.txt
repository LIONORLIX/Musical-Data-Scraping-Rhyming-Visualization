------ Entr'acte; Take Back Your Mink ------
--- Unknown ---
He bought me the fur mink five winters ago
And the gown the following fall
Then the necklace, the bag, the gloves, and the hat,
That was late '48 I recall
Then last night in his apartment
He tried to remove them all
And I said as I ran down the hall.
--- Unknown ---
Take back your mink
Take back your pearls
What made you think
That I was one of those girls?
Take back the gown
The gloves and the hat
I may be down
But I'm not flat as all that.
--- Unknown ---
I thought that each expensive gift you'd arranged
Was a token of your esteem
But when I think of what you want in exchange
It all seems a horrible dream
Eek.
--- Unknown ---
So take back your mink.
To from whence it came
And tell them to alter and rise it
For some other dame
--- Unknown ---
Take back your mink
Take back your pearls
What made you think
That I was one of those girls?
I'm screaming:
Take back the gown
The gloves and the hat
I may be down
But I'm not flat as all that.
--- Unknown ---
I thought that each expensive gift you'd arranged
Was a token of your esteem
But when I think of what you want in exchange
It all seems a horrible dream
Eek!
--- Unknown ---
Take back your mink
Those old worn out pelts
And go shorten the sleaves
For somebody else.
