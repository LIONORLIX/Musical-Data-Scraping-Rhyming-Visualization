------ My Time of Day ------
--- Unknown ---
My time of day is the dark time
A couple of deals before dawn
When the street belongs to the cop
And the janitor with the mop
And the grocery clerks are all gone.
--- Unknown ---
When the smell of the rainwashed pavement
Comes up clean, and fresh, and cold
And the streetlamp light
Fills the gutter with gold
--- Unknown ---
That's my time of day
My time of day
