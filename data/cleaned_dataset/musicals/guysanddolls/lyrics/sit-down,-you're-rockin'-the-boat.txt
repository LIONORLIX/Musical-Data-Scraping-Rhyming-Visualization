------ Sit Down, You're Rockin' the Boat ------
--- Unknown ---
I dreamed last night I got on the boat to heaven
And by some chance I had brought my dice along
And there I stood
And I hollered Someone SAVE me
But the passengers, they knew right from wrong.
For the people all said sit down, sit down, you're rockin' the boat
--- Unknown ---
People all said sit down
Sit down you're rockin' the boat.
--- Unknown ---
And the devil will drag you under
By the sharp lapel of your checkered coat,
Sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down,
--- Unknown ---
Sit down you're rockin' the boat.
--- Unknown ---
I sailed away on that little boat to heaven
And by some chance found a bottle in my fist
And there I stood,Nicely passin' out the whiskey
But the passengers were bound to resist
For the people all said beware
You're on a heavenly trip
People all said beware
Beware, you'll scuttle the ship.
And the devil will drag you under
By the fancy tie 'round your wicked throat
Sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down
Sit down, you're rockin' the boat
--- Unknown ---
And as I laughed at those passengers to heaven (laughs)
(gasps!) A great big wave came and washed me over board!
And as I sank And I hollered someone save me!
That's the moment I woke up Thank the lord
And I said to myself, sit down, sit down,
You're rockin' the boat!
Said to myself sit down, sit down, you're rockin' the boat
And the devil will drag you under With a SOLE so heavy you'd never float,
Sit down, sit down, sit down
