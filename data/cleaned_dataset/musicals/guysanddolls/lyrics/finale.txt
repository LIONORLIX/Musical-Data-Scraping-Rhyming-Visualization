------ Finale ------
--- Unknown ---
When you see a guy reach for stars in the sky
You can bet that he's doing it for some dolls
When you spot a John waiting out in the rain
Chances are he's insane as only a John can be for a Jane.
--- Unknown ---
When you meet a gent paying all kinds of rent
For a flat that could flatten the Taj Mahal.
Call it sad, call it funny
But it's better than even money
