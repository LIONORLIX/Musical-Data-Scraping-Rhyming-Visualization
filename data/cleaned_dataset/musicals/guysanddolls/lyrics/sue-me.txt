------ Sue Me ------
--- Unknown ---
You promise me this, you promise me that
You promise me anything under the sun
Then you give me a kiss,
And your grabbing your hat
And your off to the races again
When I think of the time gone by
--- Unknown ---
Adelaide, Adelaide!
--- Unknown ---
And I think of the way I tried!
--- Unknown ---
Adelaide!
--- Unknown ---
I could honestly die.
--- Unknown ---
Call a lawyer and sue me,
Sue me
What can you do me,
I love you.
Give a holler and hate me
Hate me
Go ahead, hate me!
I LOVE YOU
--- Unknown ---
The best years of my life, I was a fool to give you you
--- Unknown ---
Alright, already, I'm just a no-goodnick!
Alright, already, it's true.
So new.
So sue me, sue me
What can you do me?
I love you
--- Unknown ---
You gamble it here,
You gamble it there
You gamble on everything, all except me
And I'm sick of you keeping me up in the air
Till your back in the money again
When I think of the time gone by
--- Unknown ---
Adelaide, Adelaide!
--- Unknown ---
And I think of the way I tried!
--- Unknown ---
Adelaide!
--- Unknown ---
I could honestly die.
--- Unknown ---
Serve a paper and sue me, sue me
What can you do me,
I love you.
Give a holler and hate me,
Hate me,
Go ahead, hate me!
--- Unknown ---
When you wind up in jail
Don't come to me to bail you out!
--- Unknown ---
Alright, already, so call a policeman!
Alright, already, it's true
So new
So sue me, sue me
What can you do me
I love you!
--- Unknown ---
You're at it again,
You're running the game
I'm not gonna play second fiddle to that.
And I'm telling you now that we're through!
When I think of the time gone by
--- Unknown ---
Adelaide, Adelaide!
--- Unknown ---
And I think of the way I tried!
--- Unknown ---
Adelaide!
--- Unknown ---
I could honestly die.
--- Unknown ---
Sue me, sue me
Shoot bullets through me
