One
Singular sensation
Ev'ry little step she takes.
One
Thrilling combination
Ev'ry move that she makes.
One smile and suddenly nobody else will do.
You know you'll never be lonely
With you-know-who.
One moment in her presence
And you can forget the rest,
For the girl is second best to none, son.
Ooh! Sigh! Give her your attention.
Do I really have to mention
She's the one?
GIRLS
One

ALL
One, two, shoulder up
Singular sensation
Point an' point
Leap, step, kick
Hat to the head
Three, four
Leap with the hip
Follow through
Up, down
Feel the phrase
Elbow right, down, point
Step, brush,
Three, four, suddenly nobody
Step, flick, step, up
Step an' step, slow
Three, four, five, six,
Hat, kick, step, brush, Five, six...
Back, back!
For the girl is second best to none, son.
Ooh! Sigh! Give her your attention.
Do I really have to mention
She's the one?
One singular sensation
Ev'ry little step she takes
One thrilling combination
Ev'ry move that she makes
