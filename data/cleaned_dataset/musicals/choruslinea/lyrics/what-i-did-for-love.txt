------ What I Did for Love ------
--- Diana ---
Kiss today goodbye,
The sweetness and the sorrow.
Wish me luck, the same to you.
But I can't regret
What I did for love, what I did for love.
Look my eyes are dry.
The gift was ours to borrow.
It's as if we always knew,
And I won't forget what I did for love,
What I did for love.
Gone,
Love is never gone.
As we travel on,
Love's what we'll remember.
Kiss today goodbye,
And point me t'ward tomorrow.
We did what we had to do.
Won't forget, can't regret
What I did for
Love
[All]
What I did for
Love
[Diana]
What I did for...
[All (adding more voices each phrase)]
Love
Love is never gone
As we travel one
Love's what we'll remember
Kiss today goodbye.
[Diana]
And point me t'ward tomorrow.
[All]
Point me t'ward tomorrow
We did what we had to do.
Won't forget, can't regret
What I did for love.
What I did for love.
[Diana]
What I did for love
[All]
