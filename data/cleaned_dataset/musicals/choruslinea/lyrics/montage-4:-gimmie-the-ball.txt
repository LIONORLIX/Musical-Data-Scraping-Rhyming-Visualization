------ Montage 4: Gimmie the Ball ------

(Greg)
The worst thing in school was that everytime the teacher called on me
I?d be hard! I?d be hard!
Really!
I mean, I had to lean against the desk, like this. And the teacher would say
Stand up straight!
I can?t I have a pain in my... side!
Stand up straight!
Or walking down the halls, you?d have to walk, like this,
With all your books stacked up in front of you.
Yeah, I did too. I thought I was a sex maniac!
You are!!
Me too. It didn?t go down for three years.
Oh, and the bus. The bus was the worst. I?d take even one look at a bus and
Bingo!
And then there was the time
I was making out with Sally Ketchum in the back seat of the car.
We were kissing and necking and
I was feeling her boobs. And after about an hour or so,
she said,
Ohhh, don?t you wanna feel anything else?
And I suddenly thought to myself, ?No, I don?t.?
Well, I guess yeah, because it was the first time I realized I was homosexual.
And I got so depressed,
because I thought being gay meant being a bum all the rest of my life.
Goodbye twelve, goodbye thirteen,
