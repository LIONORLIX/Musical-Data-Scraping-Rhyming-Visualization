------ I Can Do That ------
--- MIKE ---
I'm watchin' Sis
Go pitterpat.
Said,
I can do that,
I can do that.
--- Unknown ---
Knew ev'ry step
Right off the bat.
Said,
I can do that,
I can do that.
--- Unknown ---
One morning Sis won't go to dance class
I grabbed her shoes and tights and all,
But my foot's too small,
So,
I stuff her shoes
With extra socks,
Run seven blocks
In nothin' flat.
Hell,
I can do that,
I can do that.
--- Unknown ---
I got to class
And had it made,
And so I stayed
The rest of my life.
All thanks to Sis
(Now married and fat),
--- Unknown ---
I can do this.
--- Unknown ---
That I can do!
