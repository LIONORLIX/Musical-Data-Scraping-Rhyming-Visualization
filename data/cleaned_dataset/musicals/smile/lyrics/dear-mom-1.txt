This is my first contest since we moved to California,you know?
Contests are better here, more of 'em, stiffer competition
But, if you win it really means something
I've been checking into it
There's Miss California Fruits, Miss Wine-Country, Miss Golden Gate, Miss Marine Land...

Dear Mom,
I'd like to see this while I'm here, mom
It's a picture of the house of Luther Burbank
It's where he's buried
Those are his gardens, pretty hot
--- Doria ---
And of Course everywhere there's Miss Teen-aged America, Miss Universe, Miss World
--- Robin ---
Well Mom, haven't got a lot to tell, mom
Nothing's happened yet
My roommates very friendly
Love to Phil and Jean
Yes,
Didn't Luther Burbank invent the nectarine?
Love, Robin
