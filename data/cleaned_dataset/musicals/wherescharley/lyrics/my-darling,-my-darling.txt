My Darling, My Darling
Till a moment ago we were Mister and Miss
Discussing the weather,
Avoiding each other's eye.
Till a moment ago when we happened to kiss
And we kissed the Mister and Miss gooodbye.
Now at last I can sigh,
--- Unknown ---
My darling, my darling,
I've wanted to call you my darling
For many and many a daay.
My darling, my darling,
I fluttered and fled like a starling;
My couurage just melted away.
Now all at once you've kissed me
And there's not a thing
I'm sane enough to say
Except, my darling, my darling,
Get used to that name of
------ fin ------
