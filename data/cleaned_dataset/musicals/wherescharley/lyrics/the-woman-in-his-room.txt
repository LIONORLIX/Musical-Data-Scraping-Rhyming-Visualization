------ The Woman In His Room ------
--- Unknown ---
Charley's a nice boy
A dear boy,
A sweet boy,
A fine boy,
A good boy
Through and through.
Charley's a nice boy,
A sweet boy,
A fine boy,
A good boy,
So loyal and so true.
I am his one girl,
The one girl,
The one girl,
The one girl
No other can replace.
So when my Charley's far form me
I'm content as I can be
Just to close my eyes
And picture his face
And picture his face
And picture-picture!
--- Unknown ---
That picture, That picture
That picture of that woman
That picture of that woman on the piano in his room.
That picture, That picture
That picture of that woman wearing tights
And a vulgar ostrich plume.
That woman, That woman
That hussy of a woman
That woman in the picture
That woman in his room!
Oh! The shock of it!
A woman in his room.
--- Unknown ---
That woman, that woman
I wonder if he's kissed her
I wonder if he's kissed her
--- Unknown ---
(spoken) Of course, of course
I'm such a fool
--- Unknown ---
She's probably his sister
Just a photograph taken at a masquerade.
What a terrible, terrible mistake I've made.
Charley's a nice boy,
A dear boy,
A sweet boy,
A fine boy,
A good boy
Through and through
Charley's a nice boy,
A sweet boy,
A fine boy,
A good boy
So loyal and so true.
I am his one girl
The one girl
The one girl
The one girl no other can replace.
--- Unknown ---
(spoken) No other.
--- Unknown ---
No other living relative. That's exactly what he said
No other living relative except his aunt.
For all the rest are dead
--- Unknown ---
(spoken) He has no sister! Then exactly who is
--- Unknown ---
That woman, that woman
That woman in the picture
That woman in the picture on the piano in his room.
That woman, That woman
That woman who I have no doubt
Is drenched in a hideous French perfume.
That woman, That woman
That gaudy, bawdy Venus
That woman's come between us
That woman in his room
Oh! The gall of it.
A woman in his room.
--- Unknown ---
That woman, that woman
For this he'll have to answer
For this he'll have to answer.
--- Unknown ---
(spoken) Oh, why am I so suspicious.
--- Unknown ---
She's probably some dancer.
Just a lady my Charley doesn't even know.
Just the cover of a program
Of some London show.
--- Unknown ---
Charley's a nice boy,
A dear boy,
A sweet boy,
A fine boy,
A good boy through and through
I shall be patiently waiting
When Charley returns from that urgent
Rendezvous.
--- Unknown ---
(spoken) A French word. I've seen it in a novel. Rendezvous. Meaning...
--- Unknown ---
That woman, That woman
I know he's with that woman
I'm sure he's with that woman on the piano in his room.
That woman, That woman
That monster of a woman
Cast a spell over my intended groom.
It's ended, all ended.
They're up there sweetly sighing
And I thought love undying
Had just begun to bloom.
Oh! The shame of it.
A woman in his room.
