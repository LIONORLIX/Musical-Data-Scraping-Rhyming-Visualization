------ My Heart Stood Still ------
--- He ---
--- Unknown ---
I laughed at sweet-hearts
I met at schools;
All indiscreet hearts
Seemed romantic fools.
A house in Iceland
Was my heart's domain.
I saw your eyes;
Now Castles Rise in Spain!
She:
--- Unknown ---
Through all my school days
I hated boys;
Those April Fool days
Brought me Loveless joys.
I read my Plato.
Love, I thought a sin;
But since your kiss,
I'm reading Missus Glynn!
Refrain
--- Unknown ---
I took one look at you,
That's all I meant to do;
And then my heart stood still!
My feet could step and walk,
My lips could move and talk,
And yet my heart stood still!
Though not a single word was spoken,
I could tell you knew,
That unfelt clasp of hands
Told me so well you knew.
I never lived at all
