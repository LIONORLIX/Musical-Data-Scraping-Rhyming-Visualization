------ I Feel At Home With You ------

This used to be a grump-y crab-bed old lad;
Look at your beam-ish boy now.
This used to be a jump-y;
silly and sad,
What is sim-ply joy now.
Life was a canyon too dark to view
Till a companion was found like you.

I used to be a hoy-den,
Boys were my hate,
I was a la-dy her- -mit
I could-n't be an-noyed in mak-ing a date;
Silly I would term it.
You seemed so dar-ing my heart grew frail,
Now I like wear-ing my coat of male.

I feel at home with you,y ou always fit on the knees that you sit on;
That's why I feel at home with you.
I love to roam with you. Each place that we go
You flatter my ego That's why I feel at home with you.
--- Unknown ---
I've a sensible, comprehensible great respect for you.
There's a dash in it of a passionate tender feeling too.
You are a part of me,
Something that's giving me reason for living;
That's why I feel at home with you.
--- Unknown ---
I feel at home with you;
Your brain is dumber than that of a plumber;
That's why I feel at home with you.
I'll match my dome with you.
Your brain needs a tonic. It's still embryonic,
That's why I feel at home with you.
--- Unknown ---
Our minds are featherweight, their together weight can't amount to much;
You use no better words, than three letter words:
Dog and Cat and such.
You have no head at all,
Something like your knob is used as a door knob;
