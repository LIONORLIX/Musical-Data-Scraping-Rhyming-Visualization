------ What I've Been Looking For ------
--- Ryan ---
It's hard to believe
That I couldn't see
--- Together ---
You were always there beside me
Thought I was alone
With no one to hold
But you were always right beside me
--- Sharpay ---
This feelings like no other
--- Together ---
I want you to know
I've never had someone that knows me like you do, the way you do
I've never had someone as good for me as you, no one like you
so lonely before I've finally found
what I've been looking for
--- Sharpay ---
So good to be seen
So good to be heard
--- Together ---
Don't have to say a word
--- Ryan ---
For so long I was lost
So good to be found
--- Together ---
I'm loving having you around
--- Ryan ---
This feeling's like no other
--- Together ---
I want you to know
--- Unknown ---
I've never had someone that knows me like you do
The way you do
I've never had someone as good for me as you
No one like you
So lonely before, I finally found
what I've been looking for
--- Together ---
Doo Doo DooDoo
Doo Doo DooDoo
Do Do
--- Unknown ---
Woa-ah-ah-oh
