------ Counting on You ------
--- Chad ---
There's a choice
that you have to make
--- Taylor ---
And it's pretty plain to see
--- Zeke ---
You're either out or in
--- Martha ---
You either lose or win
--- All ---
Are you gonna turn your back on history
--- Taylor ---
on the legend that your a part of
--- Chad ---
On the job that you were born to do?
--- All ---
Don't let us down
You gotta come through
'Cause we're counting on
Counting on, counting on you
--- SPOKEN ---

Gabriella:  What History?
Troy:  What legend?
Chad: Spider Bill Natrine
Taylor:  Harriet Tubman
Zeke:  Sam Slamma-Jamma Netletter
Martha:  Madame Curie
Jason:  Thunderclap Hap Haddon
Kratnoff:  Eleanor Roosevelt
Chad:  Do you think these Wildcat legends won championships
by worrying about some brainiac chick or auditioning for musicals?
Taylor:  Do you think these paragons of education
and accomplishement concerned themselves with jocks or auditions for musicals?
All:  I don't think so!
--- SUNG ---
--- Jocks ---
Check out the champions
Who came before
Hail the hero that you could be
--- Brainiacs ---
And put away that dream,
'Cause there's no I in TEAM
--- ALL ---
And the sacrifice is worth it
we all agree
--- Jocks ---
You just have to keep your focus
--- Brainiacs ---
Forget about you-know-who
--- All ---
Don't let us down
You gotta come through
'Cause we're counting on
Counting on, counting on you
--- Spoken ---

Troy:  That's my dad!
Gabriella:  That's Troy!
Chad:  Heartbreak Bolton.  Missed the last basket of the 1981 Championships.
Do it for him, Troy.  Give him the championship he always dreamed of.
Taylor:  Heartbreak Bolton.  Another lost-cause, bonehead jock.
But you...you're the future of civilization.
--- Sung ---
--- Jocks ---
You're next in line
You're part of the chain
and now that we can make it
Don't break it!
--- Martha ---
You're the heir apparent
--- Taylor ---
That's what everyone says
--- Brainiacs ---
From Frida Kahlo, Indira Gandhi
Rosa Parks, Amelia Earheart
To Gabriella Montez
--- Unknown ---
(overlapping)
--- Jocks ---
Bolton! Bolton! Bolton! Bolton! Bolton!
--- All ---
Now the pressure is way up high
Which way are you gonna go?
You gonna sing a song
Or are you gonna be strong
Trade your fantasies in
for the thing you know
The destiny you've been handed
The only thing that you can do?
--- Unknown ---
Don't let us down
You gotta come through
'Cause we're counting on
Counting on, counting on you
--- Unknown ---
Yeah we're counting on you
We're counting on you
So don't let us down
You gotta come through
--- Unknown ---
We're counting on,
counting on,counting on,counting on...
