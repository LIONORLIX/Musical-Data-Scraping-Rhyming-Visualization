------ Stick to the Status Quo ------
--- Zeke (Spoken) ---
Dude, you are so totally awesome!
--- Troy (Spoken) ---
Uhm, thanks. Why?
--- Zeke (Spoken) ---
If you can come out in the open about singing, then I can tell my secret, too. I love to bake.
--- Jocks/Cheerleaders (Spoken) ---
What?!
--- Zeke ---
You can bet there's nothing but net
When I am in the zone and on a roll.
But I've got a confession, my own secret obsession
And it's making me loose control!
--- Jocks/Cheerleaders ---
Everybody, gather 'round!
--- Zeke (Spoken) ---
Scones, strudel, even apple pan-dowdy.
--- Jocks/Cheerleaders ---
Not another sound!
--- Zeke (Spoken) ---
I dream of making the perfect creme brulee.
--- Jocks/Cheerleaders ---
No, no, no, no! No, no, no!
Stick to the stuff you know. If you wanna be cool
follow one simple rule - don't mess with the flow
oh, no! Stick to the status quo!
--- Martha (Spoken) ---
Gabriella, you've changed my entire life!
--- Gabriella (Spoken) ---
I did?
--- Martha ---
Look at me and what do you see?
--- Gabriella/Taylor ---
Intelligence beyond compare!
--- Martha ---
But inside I am stirring, something strange is occuring. It's a secret I need to share!
--- Brainiacs ---
Open up, dig way down deep!
--- Martha (Spoken) ---
Hip hop is my passion! I love to pop, lock, jam, and break!
--- Kratnoff (Spoken) ---
Is that legal?
--- Brainiacs ---
Not another peep!
--- Martha (Spoken) ---
It's just dancing. And the truth is, sometimes I think it's even cooler than homework!
--- Brainiacs ---
No, no, no, no! No, no, no!
Stick to the stuff you know. It is better by far
to keep things as they are. Don't mess with the flow
oh, no! Stick with the status quo!

(Ripper rushes over to Troy and Gabriella)
--- Troy/Gabriella (Spoken) ---
Not you too!
--- Ripper ---
Listen well, I'm ready to tell...
--- Troy/Gabriella/Skater Dudes ---
About a need that you cannot deny.
--- Ripper ---
Dude, there's no explanation for this awesome sensation but I'm ready to let it fly!
--- Skater Dudes ---
Speak your mind and you'll be heard!
--- Ripper (Spoken) ---
If Troy can be in a show, then I'm coming clean. I play the cello.
--- Mongo (Spoken) ---
Awesome. What is it?
--- Unknown ---
(Ripper plays a wild air-cello solo)
--- Skater Dudes ---
Not another word!
--- Mongo (Spoken) ---
Do you have to wear a costume?
--- Ripper (Spoken) ---
Jacket and tie.
--- Mongo (Spoken) ---
That's uncalled for!
--- Troy/Gabriella ---
No, no, no, no!
--- Skater Dudes ---
No, no, no!
--- Troy/Gabriella ---
Don't stick to the stuff you know.
If you wanna go far, gotta reach for your star. Just follow your dreams and go!
Don't stick with the status quo!
--- Rebels ---
Don't stick to the status quo!
--- Troy/Gabriella/Rebels ---
No, no, no! Don't stick to the stuff you know!
No, you got to be true to the thing that you do.
No, don't be afraid to show
you won't stick to the status quo!
--- Unknown ---
(Sharpay and Ryan enter and witness the chaos)
--- Sharpay ---
This is not what I want. This is not what I planned.
And I just got to say, I do not understand.
--- Rebels (Simultaneous to Sharpay and Ryan) ---
Something is changing. Something is happening.
Somehow I finally belong!
--- Sharpay ---
Something is really...
--- Ryan ---
Something's not right -
--- Sharpay ---
... Really wrong!
--- Both ---
And we gotta get things back where they belong!
--- Rebels ---
We can do it!
--- Ripper (Spoken) ---
Gotta Play!
--- Cliques ---
Stick with what you know.
--- Rebels ---
We can do it!
--- Martha (Spoken) ---
Hip-hop hooray!
--- Sharpay ---
She has got to go!
--- Rebels ---
We can do it!
--- Zeke (Spoken) ---
Creme brulee!
--- Cliques ---
Keep your voice down low!
Not another peep!
--- Rebels ---
No!
--- Cliques ---
Not another word!
--- Rebels ---
No!
--- Cliques ---
Not another sound!
--- Rebels ---
No!
--- Sharpay ---
Everybody quiet!
--- Cliques/Rebels (Throughout dialogue) ---
No No. No No. No No. No No. No No.
No No. No No. No No. No No. No No.
--- Gabriella (Spoken) ---
It's just a callback. I mean, is Sharpay really mad?
--- Taylor (Spoken) ---
Let's put it this way: no one has beaten out Sharpay for a musical since kindergarten.
--- Zeke (Spoken) ---
Troy, because of you I'm finally going to give Sharpay a token of my love. Look!: (reveals a cake)
--- Troy (Spoken) ---
I don't know that this is the best time to give Sharpay a cake.
--- Cliques ---
Oh! No! No, no, no!
--- Rebels ---
No, no, no!
--- Sharpay/Ryan/Cliques ---
Stick to the stuff you know. If you wanna be cool
follow one simple rule - don't mess with the flow oh, no! Stick with the status quo! No, no, no!
Stick with the stuff you know. It is better by far
to keep things as they are. Don't mess with the flow oh, no! Stick to the status quo!
Stick to the status quo!  Stick to the status quo!
--- Troy/Gabriella/Rebels (Simultaneously) ---
Follow your dream and go! Go! Go!
Gotta live, gotta grow! Oh, no!:
Don't stick with the status quo! No, no, no, no!
Follow your dreams and go! Go! Go!
Gotta live, gotta grow! Don't stick to the status quo!
Don't stick to the status quo! Don't stick to the status quo!
--- All ---
Quo! Quo! Quo!
