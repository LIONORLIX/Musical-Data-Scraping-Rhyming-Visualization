Looking from the outside
I'm standing here but all I want
Is to be over there
Why did I let myself believe
Miracles could happen?

I thought you were my fairytale
A dream when I'm not sleeping

GABRIELLA & TROY: Now I know you?re not a fairytale
And dreams were meant for sleeping
And wishes on a star
