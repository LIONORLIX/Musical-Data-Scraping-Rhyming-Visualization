------ Start of Something New (Reprise) ------

TROY: It feels so right to be here with you
And now, looking in your eyes
I feel in my heart
The start of something new
Living in my own world
Didn't understand
That anything can happen
When you take a chance

GABRIELLA: I never believed in
What I couldn't see
I never opened my heart
To all the possibilities
--- Unknown ---
BOTH: Oh, I know that something has changed
Never felt this way
--- Unknown ---
GABRIELLA: I know it's for real
--- Unknown ---
BOTH: This could be the start of something new
--- Unknown ---
TROY: It feels so right
--- Unknown ---
GABRIELLA: To be here with you
--- Unknown ---
BOTH: Oh, and now, looking in your eyes
I feel in my heart
