What's new Buenos Aires?
I'm new, I wanna say I'm just a little stuck on you
You'll be on me too
--- Unknown ---
I get out here, Buenos Aires
Stand back, you oughta know whatcha gonna get in me
Just a little touch of star quality
--- Unknown ---
Fill me up with your heat, with your noise
With your dirt, overdo me
Let me dance to your beat, make it loud
Let it hurt, run it through me.
Don't hold back, you are certain to impress
Tell the driver this is where I'm staying
--- Unknown ---
Hello, Buenos Aires
Get this, just look at me dressed up, somewhere to go
We'll put on a show
--- Unknown ---
Take me in at your flood, give me speed
Give me lights, set me humming
Shoot me up with your blood, wine me up
With your nights, watch me coming
All I want is a whole lot of excess
Tell the singer this is where I'm playing
--- Unknown ---
Stand back, Buenos Aires
Because you oughta know whatcha gonna get in me
Just a little touch of star quality
--- Unknown ---
And if ever I go too far
It's because of the things you are
Beautiful town, I love you
And if I need a moment's rest
Give your lover the very best
Real eiderdown and silence.

You're a tramp, you're a treat
You will shine to the death, you are shoddy
But you're flesh, you are meat
You shall have every breath in my body
Put me down for a lifetime of success
Give me credit, I'll find ways of paying

Stand back, Buenos Aires
Because you oughta know whatcha gonna get in me
Just a little touch of
