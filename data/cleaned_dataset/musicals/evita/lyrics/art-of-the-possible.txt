------ Art of the Possible ------
--- OFFICERS ---
One has no rules
Is not precise
One rarely acts
The same way twice
One spurns no device
Practicing the art of the possible
--- Unknown ---
One always picks
The easy fight
One praises fools
One smothers light
one shifts left to right
It's part of the art of the possible

EVA (on the air)
I'm only a radio star with just one weekly show
But speaking as one of the people I want you to know
We are tired of the decline of
Argentina with no sign of
A government able to give us the things we deserve
--- OFFICERS ---
One always claims
Mistakes were planned
When risk is slight
One takes one's stand
With much sleight of hand
Politics--the art of the possible
--- Unknown ---
One has no rules
Is not precise
One rarely acts
The same way twice
One spurns no device
Politics--the art of the possible
--- VOICES ---
