------ Eva's Final Broadcast ------
--- Eva: ---
The actress hasn't learned the lines you'd like to hear
She's sad for her country, sad to be defeated
By her own weak body
--- Crowds: ---
Evita! Evita! [repeat in background]
--- Unknown ---
I want to tell the people of Argentina
I've decided I should decline
All the honors and titles you've pressed me to take
For I'm contented
Let me simply go on as the woman who brings her people
To the heart of Peron
--- Unknown ---
Don't cry for me Argentina
The truth is I shall not leave you
Though it may get harder for you to see me
I'm Argentina, and always will be
--- Unknown ---
Have I said too much?
There's nothing more I can think of to say to you
But all you have to do is look at me to know
------ fin ------
