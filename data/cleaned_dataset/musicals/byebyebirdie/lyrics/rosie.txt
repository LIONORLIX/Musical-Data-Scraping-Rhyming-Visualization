------ Rosie ------
--- Albert ---
I was never crazy for flowers,
I confess that nothing left me colder;
I could watch a daisy for hours
And all I'd feel was sev'ral hours older!
Lilacs and lilies, any bloom you please,
All what they did was make me shrug or sneeze;
But now I love each blossom that I see,
For a lovely little rose loves me.
Now my life is rosy, when I'm my Rosie,
With a girl like Rosie,
How could I be blue?
Hand in hand we'll mosey
Me and little Rosie,
We will be so cozy
By a fire built for two.
Oh! I once heard a poem that goes:
A rose is a rose is a rose
Well I don't agree,
Take it from me,
There's one rose sweeter than any that grows!
That's my Rosie,
I'm so glad she chose me;
Life is one sweet beautiful song to me.
Now my life is rosy, (Oh, we'll be happy, I know)
Since I found my Rosie,(Off to the preacher we'll go)
With a girl like Rosie,(So how could we be blue?)
How could I be blue?
Rosie:
Oh we'll have us a home out west,
A nice little split-level nest,
And in ev'ry room roses in bloom...
Albert:
But there's on rose sweeter than all of the rest!
Then that's my Rosie
Rosie:
I'm so glad you chose me!
Both:
Life is one sweet beautiful song to me
When love is right then
What can be wrong?
Life is one sweet beautiful song
