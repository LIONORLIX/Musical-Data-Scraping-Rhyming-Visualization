Gray skies are gonna clear up,
Put on a happy face!
Brush off the clouds and cheer up,
Put on a happy face!
--- Unknown ---
Take off that gloomy mask of tragedy,
It's not your style.
You'll look so good that you'll be glad ya decided to smile!
--- Unknown ---
Pick out a pleasant outlook,
Stick out that noble chin,
Wipe off that full-of-doubt look,
Slap on a happy grin!
--- Unknown ---
And spread sunshine all over the place, just
Put on a happy face!
--- Unknown ---
Put on a happy face!

Put on a happy face!
--- Unknown ---
And if you're feeling cross and bickerish
Don't sit and whine.
Think of banana splits and licorice,
And you'll feel fine!

I knew a girl so gloomy,
She'd never laugh or sing,
SHe wouldn't listen to me,
Now she's a mean old thing!
--- Unknown ---
So spread sunshine all over the place, just
Put on a happy face!
