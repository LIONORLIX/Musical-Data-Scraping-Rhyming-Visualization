------ Lot of Livin' to Do ------
--- Birdie ---
There are chicks just ripe for some kissin'
And I mean to kiss me a few!
Then those chicks don't know what they're missin',
I got a lot of living to do!
Sizzlin' steaks all ready for tastin'
And there's Cadillacs all shiny and new!
Gotta move, cause time is a-wastin',
There's such a lot of livin' to do!
--- Kim ---
There are men of nineteen or twenty
Who are suave and reckless and true
Older men who give a girl plenty
I've gotta a lot of livin' to do
--- Birdie ---
There's music to play,
Places to go, people to see!
Everything for you and me!
--- Birdie ---
There's music to play,(You know it, you know it!)
Places to go, people to see!
Everything (Yeah!)
For you and me!
--- All ---
Oh, Life's a ball
if only you know it
And it's all just waiting for you
You're alive,
So come on and show it
We got a lot of livin'
Such a lot of livin'
