------ Spanish Rose ------
--- Rosie ---
I'm just a Spanish tamale according to Mae
Right off the boat from the tropics far far away
Which is kind of funny
Since where I come from is Allentown, Pa
Spanish!
Ok, may I'll be Spanish
Right after I've married Alberto
--- Unknown ---
I'll be the toast of chi-chi Costanango,
And all day long my castanets will click!
I'll hide behind my fan and do the tango!
I'll be so Spanish it'll make you sick!
I'll eat the tacos and the enchilada!
I'll drink Tequila till I feel no pain!
The only song I'll sing will be Granada!
I'll be more espa?ol than Abbe Lane!

Coo coo coo
La cuc.........racha
Ssssso
Call me the wild Spanish rose!
The craziest flower that grows
I'll kick up my heels and see
How it feels to be sultry Spanish rose
Ol?!
--- Unknown ---
Behind my mantilla I will pose
The beauty that nobody knows!
So regal and cool, exciting and cruel,
That's me! Spanish rose
--- Unknown ---
(My name Rosita Hernandez!)
--- Unknown ---
"Americano" let me give you a bit of advice
To cross Spanish do not twice
Your match you have found
So don't mess around
Her heart is cold as ice!
--- Unknown ---
With Albert I will dance to the bolero
We'll cha cha in the nicest honky tonks
Hell wear a little mustache and sombrero
My handsome Latin lover from the Bronx
--- Unknown ---
So now that you've met Spanish rose
Never forget Spanish rose
Shell taunt you,
Shell tame you but what man can blame you
For worshiping Spanish rose.
