------ Baby, Talk to Me ------
--- Albert ---
Talk To me, baby, won't you talk to me
I don't care what you say
Baby, talk to me
Must you to be oh so far away from me
It seems so wrong this way
Talk to me
And if you miss me
Tell me so
Are you lonely
Tell me so
Say you love me
Tell me so
Honey, let me know
Talk to me
Till I press you close to me
Then you'll see
We won't have to talk at all
I don't care what you say
Talk to me
And if you miss me
Are you lonely
Say you love me
Tell me so
Let me know
Chorus:
Talk to me
Till I press you close to me
Then you'll see
We won't have to talk at all
Till I press you close to me
Then you'll see
We won't have to talk at all
Talk to me
Talk to me
