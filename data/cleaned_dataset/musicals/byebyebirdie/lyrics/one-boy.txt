Oh Kim, I feel so much better now! All thoughts of a nosebleed have utterly vanished!
Kim:
You were silly to worry, Hugo.
Conrad Birdie may be a great public figure but he doesn't make me feel all dizzy and faint
when I think of him. Only my steady does that.
Why even when I say his name I don't feel a thing. Listen. Conrad Birdie!
Conrad Birdie. (It hits her)
Conrad Birdie..... (dreamily she almosts faints)
