------ What Did I Ever See in Him? ------
--- Rosie ---
Eight years, eight years,
That's how long I've wasted on him!
That's all, I'm through.
Albert dear, to put it sweetly,
To hell with you!
What did I ever see in him?
How did I ever get evolved that way?
Now that it's over I can smile and say
What did I ever see in him?
Boy, I was way out on the limb.
Now that my feet are on the ground again,
Now that my senses have been found again,
What did I ever see in him?
Is he tender?
No, he's not!
Is he thoughtful?
No, he's not!
Am I crazy?
What's he's got that I found so damned appealing?
What did he ever do for me?
Well, to be honest he was sometimes nice,
But still it wasn't worth that awful price.
It was rough from the start.
Broken dates, broken nails, broken heart
How did I ever?
Why did I ever?
What did I ever?
Rosie and Kim:
Do we need them? No, we don't!
Do we want them? No, we don't!
Will we leave them? No, we won't!
Tell me what did I say that for?
What did we ever see in them?
How could we ever think that they were nice?
Take it from us we pay an awful price
It was rough from the start
Broken dates, broken nails, broken heart
