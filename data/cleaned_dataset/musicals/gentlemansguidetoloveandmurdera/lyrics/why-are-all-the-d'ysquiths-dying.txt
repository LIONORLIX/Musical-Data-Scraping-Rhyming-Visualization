------ Why Are All the D'Ysquiths Dying ------
--- MOURNERS ---
Why are all the D'Ysquiths dying?
What grisly sort of plague is going round?
It seems with every day
A D'Ysquith slips away
And here we are assembled putting another one in the ground
--- Unknown ---
It's frankly all been rather mystifying
Do forgive me if I scoff:
But is it not a trifle odd
How they've all gone off to God
Suddenly they're congregating underneath the sod
--- Unknown ---
Oh, why are all the D'Ysquiths dying
What a tasteless way of showing off
--- Unknown ---
Why are all the D'Ysquiths dying
It seems that all of London's shaken to the core
To lose one relative
One can certainly forgive
But how can you excuse losing two
Or three
Or four
Or seven
--- Unknown ---
Why are all the D'Ysquiths dying
I've never seen such recklessness before
It's unnerving
It's not that they're not undeserving
I never liked them much, I must confess
In fairness
You must admit, at least,
It's a shame about the priest
I can't imagine missing someone less
--- Unknown ---
But really, why are all the D'Ysquiths dying
When truth to tell so many others should
Though
Privately it was said
They should all drop dead
No one thought
They ever really would
--- Unknown ---
I happened to notice there wasn't a lot of crying
I even heard a snigger from the back
Oh, it really is a shame
How they start to feel the same
How many are there left to bury after what's-his-name?
--- Unknown ---
I ask you
--- Unknown ---
Why are all the D'Ysquiths dying
Whoever's next, I swear I won't come back
I'm utterly exhausted keeping track
