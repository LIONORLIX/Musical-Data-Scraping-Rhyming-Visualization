------ That Horrible Woman ------
--- Unknown ---
SIBELLA (to DETECTIVE)
That horrible woman!
That contemptable girl!
--- DETECTIVE ---
(spoken) Countess Navarro?
--- SIBELLA ---
Oh, make no mistake
She's a venomous snake
And she poisoned the Earl!
And Mister Navarro
Was a pawn in her plan
I have come here to save him
He's an innocent man!
--- DETECTIVE ---
(spoken) Do you know what you're saying, Mrs. Holland?
--- PHOEBE is revealed in another room with a Magistrate ---
--- SIBELLA & PHOEBE ---
He's an innocent man!
--- PHOEBE (to MAGISTRATE) ---
That horrible woman!
--- MAGISTRATE ---
(spoken) Mrs. Holland?
--- PHOEBE ---
Do not utter her name!
You must tell the court
How she poisoned the port
And diverted the blame!
Go and bring her to justice
Just as fast as you can!
As I've told you, my husband
Is an innocent man!
--- SIBELLA ---
She seemed tense and alert-
--- PHOEBE ---
From hor d'oeuvres to dessert-
--- SIBELLA & PHOEBE ---
Yet she flirt-
-Ed and batted her eyes
At the men.
--- SIBELLA ---
Then she rose from her seat-
--- PHOEBE ---
Then she reached for a sweet-
--- SIBELLA & PHOEBE ---
Every gesture was planned.
--- PHOEBE ---
Then-
--- SIBELLA ---
Thinking no one could see-
--- SIBELLA & PHOEBE ---
No one saw her but me-
--- PHOEBE ---
In a blink-
--- SIBELLA & PHOEBE ---
She put drops in his drink.
--- PHOEBE ---
That's a quote-
--- SIBELLA ---
From a letter she wrote-
--- PHOEBE ---
In her very own hand!
--- SIBELLA ---
In her very own hand!
--- SIBELLA & PHOEBE ---
That horrible woman!
--- SIBELLA ---
That miserable minx!
--- PHOEBE ---
That libidinous jinx!
--- SIBELLA ---
Every word is a lie!
--- PHOEBE ---
She's unspeakably sly!
--- SIBELLA & PHOEBE ---
And I hear that she drinks!
--- PHOEBE ---
Surely Mister Navarro-
--- SIBELLA ---
And so Monty, of course-
--- SIBELLA & PHOEBE ---
Was a pawn in her plan!
--- PHOEBE ---
He would not hurt a fly!
--- SIBELLA ---
He could not hurt a flea!
--- PHOEBE ---
You cannot let him die!
--- SIBELLA ---
You must set the man free!
--- SIBELLA & PHOEBE ---
For Montague D'Ysquith Navarro
Is an innocent man!
--- SIBELLA ---
It was donne out of greed!
--- PHOEBE ---
It was done out of spite!
--- SIBELLA ---
She wanted the title!
--- SIBELLA & PHOEBE ---
She wanted revenge!
--- PHOEBE ---
And my husband, he knew-
--- SIBELLA ---
And she didn't care who-
--- SIBELLA & PHOEBE ---
Would be hanged for the crime!
--- DETECTIVE & MAGISTRATE ---
Dear lady!
--- A GUARD overhears them all. ---
--- PHOEBE ---
She-
--- SIBELLA ---
As I'm sure you can see-
--- SIBELLA & PHOEBE ---
She's/is a merciless-
--- SIBELLA ---
Ravenous-
--- PHOEBE ---
Man-eating-
--- DETECTIVE & MAGISTRATE ---
Monstrous-
--- ALL ---
Assassin!
--- DETECTIVE & MAGISTRATE ---
A beast!
--- SIBELLA & PHOEBE ---
Monty must be released!
--- DETECTIVE & MAGISTRATE ---
And there isn't much time!
--- SIBELLA & PHOEBE ---
And there isn't much time!
--- DETECTIVE & MAGISTRATE ---
That horrible woman!
--- ALL ---
That sinister wench!
--- SIBELLA ---
Pray you do what is just!
--- PHOEBE ---
Stop the jury you must
--- ALL ---
Get a stay from the bench!
In the name of King Edward
We must do what we can!
--- SIBELLA & PHOEBE ---
As the ending was changed
When the nightingale sang-
--- DETECTIVE & MAGISTRATE ---
Fate must be rearranged-
--- ALL ---
We must not let him hang!
For Montague D'Ysquith Navarro
Is an innocent man!
He's an innocent man!
He's an innocent-
