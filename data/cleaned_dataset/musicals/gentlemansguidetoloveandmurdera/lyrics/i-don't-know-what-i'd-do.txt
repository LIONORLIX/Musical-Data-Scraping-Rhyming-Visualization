------ I Don't Know What I'd Do ------
--- SIBELLA ---
Monty?
Monty
--- Unknown ---
Don't you just love me in pink?
Would you please?
Maybe a flower for my hair
No, no, yes, no
Violet, no I tired of roses, I think
Look, you've brought me chocolates
Oh no, I don't dare
--- Unknown ---
Do you hate these earrings?
Now, the truth
Don't be kind
I don't mind
Because I hate them too
--- Unknown ---
No, no, no, don't squeeze
Monty, you're a tease
Oh, Monty, look
My shoe
I don't know what I'd do without you
--- Unknown ---
I have never met another man who's half as dear as you
You're so clever too
And you make me laugh
More than anybody
Why are other men so dreary, Monty
And so deadly dull?
No one holds a conversation half as beautifully as you
--- MONTY ---
Well, actually, there is a matter of some urgency, I should like to discuss.
--- SIBELLA ---
You haven't said a word about my dress
You're a brute
Look, see how it moves when I turn, 2, 3, 1, 2
It's a bit much for Clapham
But nevertheless
Maybe just a bite
Just to be polite
Monty, that's too tight
Monty, that's just right
--- Unknown ---
Oh, what I put you through
I don't know what I'd do
Oh, you know that it's true
I don't know what I'd do without you
