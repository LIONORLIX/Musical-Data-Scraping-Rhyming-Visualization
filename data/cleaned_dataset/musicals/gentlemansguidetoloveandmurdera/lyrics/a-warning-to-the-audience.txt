------ A Warning to the Audience ------
--- ENSEMBLE ---
For those of you of weaker constitution
For those of you who may be faint of heart
This is a tale of revenge and retribution
So if you're smart
Before we start
You'd best depart
You'd best depart
--- Unknown ---
An usher fainted in the aisle
A nun from Leicester lost her wits
You might avoid the first or second row
--- Unknown ---
Blood may spill
And spines may chill
It's ghastly - still
We thought you ought to know
It's only just past eight
It's not too late
For God's sake!
For God's sake
