Foolish to think i could let him fall he's on the brink it seems but why should i pause when i know the cause of mother's...shattered dreams?
--- REVEREND LORD EZEKIAL ---
Help me, you presumptous climber!
--- MONTY ---
What can i do for the Dy'Squiths to repay their warm embrace?!
What can i take from the Dy'Squiths...
--- Unknown ---
Except, perhaps, their place? but with eight other Dy'Squiths ahead of me, their foolish pride survives

What can i take from the Dy'Squiths?
Except, Perhaps, Excepts, Perhaps
--- REVEREND LORD EZEKIAL ---
Please!
--- MONTY ---
Except, Perhaps their lives
