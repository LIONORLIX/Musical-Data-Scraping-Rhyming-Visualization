------ Poison in My Pocket (Reprise) ------
--- MONTY ---
I am standing here with poison in my pocket
look who's head head is finally on the block
it seems that now at last the moment i've been waiting for is here
--- Unknown ---
All that's really left to be decided is the dish to put the poison in, provided i can do what must be done discreetly when the coast is clear.
--- Unknown ---
I confess it pains me some to run someone's cooking oh, for god's sake, now another servant's looking, i have had a run of luck but this one does require skill
--- Unknown ---
Fish or fowl, it must be well-selected so that no one else at all will be affected
