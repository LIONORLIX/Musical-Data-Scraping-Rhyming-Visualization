------ You're a D'Ysquith ------
--- MISS SHINGLE ---
Have you heard of the D'Ysquith family?
--- MONTY ---
The D'Ysquiths? Why, yes, of course. Hasn't everyone?
--- MISS SHINGLE ---
Then you've heard of Highhurst Castle.
--- MONTY ---
Of course.
--- MISS SHINGLE ---
You're aware, then, of their position, their vast wealth and influence?
--- MONTY ---
Yes, yes. What's it got to do with me?
--- MISS SHINGLE ---
You're a D'Ysquith
--- MONTY ---
What?
--- MISS SHINGLE ---
You're a D'Ysquith
--- MONTY ---
No.
--- MISS SHINGLE ---
Ha ha, oh.
--- Unknown ---
The D'Ysquith blood is flowing through you
--- MONTY ---
Me, a D'Ysquith?
--- MISS SHINGLE ---
A genuine bona fide D'Ysquith
--- MONTY ---
Rubbish.
--- MISS SHINGLE ---
Of course, of course
Ya don't believe me, do you?
--- MONTY ---
You must be mad.
--- MISS SHINGLE ---
Very well, then. If your mother was not a D'Ysquith, what was her maiden name?
--- MONTY ---
She always insisted that the only name that mattered (whispered) was my fathers.
--- MISS SHINGLE ---
Your mother
Lived like a princess in every way
A daughter of Lord Maximillian
Till she met your father one fateful day
She knew it was love - and yet
--- Unknown ---
The family did fear she'd been led astray
By a climbing, conniving Castilian
Oh let him go
Or else you'll know
A life you will live to regret
--- Unknown ---
This was no idle threat
--- Unknown ---
"You're a D'Ysquith
A perfectly breedable D'Ysquith
And a D'Ysquith does her duty
Don't forget
--- Unknown ---
There was nothing your mother could say
She eloped with your father the very next day
--- MONTY ---
So she was... disinherited?
--- MISS SHINGLE ---
In a word. Yes. Despicable, the lot of them.
--- MONTY ---
How awful.
--- MISS SHINGLE ---
Your mother
Made me promise I'd never tell
But now she is no longer living
She wanted to spare you her private hell
But I think you deserve to know
--- Unknown ---
Take this knowledge and use it well
The family may yet be forgiven
--- Unknown ---
This will guarantee
You've a right to be
On the family tree
And it seems to be
Indisputably
Head to toe
--- Unknown ---
You're a D'Ysquith
A D-apostrophe-Y-squith
A-there can be
No other way to view it
Montague, you're a D'Ysquith
--- MONTY ---
I'm all of a sudden a D'Ysquith
--- MISS SHINGLE ---
Yes!
And it's time
That everybody knew it
--- Unknown ---
A-you are the son of the daughter
Of the grandson
Of the nephew
Of the fat cat of all Highhurst, Wooten
--- MONTY ---
I am the son of the daughter
Of the...
--- BOTH ---
The grandson (MONTY: Oh, sorry.)
Of the nephew
Of the second Earl of Highhurst
--- MONTY ---
The thought occurred: why should I believe a woman who might very well be insane? And yet, there seems to be an air of authenticity to this document.
--- Unknown ---
I'm a D'Ysquith (MISS SHINGLE: You're a D'Ysquith)
It would seem I'm a D'Ysquith
--- MISS SHINGLE ---
You're a D'Ysquith
--- Unknown ---
Montague
I picture you
At Highhurst
--- MONTY ---
Yesterday, I was Monty Navarro
--- MISS SHINGLE ---
You could be it all tomorrow
--- MONTY ---
And Highhurst could be My-hurst
--- Unknown ---
I'm a D'Ysquith
--- MISS SHINGLE ---
You're a D'Ysquith
--- BOTH ---
A D'Ysquith
A D'Ysquith
