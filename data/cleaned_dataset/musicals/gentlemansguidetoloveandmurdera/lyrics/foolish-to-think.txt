------ Foolish to Think ------
--- Unknown ---
(spoken) Pigs might fly...
--- Unknown ---
(sung) Foolish to think she would marry you.
Why would she sink so low?
You've only a claim to a noble old name.
Who could blame her for saying no?
--- Unknown ---
Foolish to dream she's in love with you.
You're a fool to believe that kiss.
The man who inspires such breathless desires, well, thats the man to dismiss.
--- Unknown ---
Foolish to hope she would ever see
All that you really are.
A man with no trade is no match, I'm afraid.
For a blade in a motor car.
He'll go far...
--- Unknown ---
Foolish to pray you will ever be
the fellow she might prefer
Lets have a drink! It's foolish to think you'll ever stop loving her.
--- Unknown ---
On a mythical scale the D'ysquiths prevail on a hill just outside of town;
In a castle they love, that is so far above, they're accustomed to looking down.
--- Unknown ---
And the fam'ly ordains that the blood in my veins is more than a trifle impure.
They conspired with each other, condemning poor mother to a heartbreaking life she could hardly endure!
--- Unknown ---
With no conscience or care, they disposed of an heir to their glorious family tree.
Do I lie down and die, or determined to try to alter the course of my destiny?
Otherwise what will become of me?
--- Unknown ---
Am I foolish to think I could ever be, will i never be more than I am today?
I can see me as a man of respect, you could never detect had once been so heartlessly cast away.
--- Unknown ---
Am I foolish to dream I'll be Earl one day?
A towering man among men.
Then who could deny, now and then, pigs can fly!
Who will look foolish then?
