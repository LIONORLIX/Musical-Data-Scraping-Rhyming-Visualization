------ I've Decided to Marry You ------
--- Phoebe ---
Mr. Navarro!
Forgive my intrusion!
I needed to see you,
And see you today!
Mr. Navarro!
Mr. Navarro!
I have arrived at a stunning
Conclusion,
And i feared i would lose my
Resolve
If i didn't come here directly
To say:
--- Unknown ---
I've decided to marry you!
I've decided to marry you!
I've decided though henry's
Gone
That life goes on for me!
I have thoroughly thought it
Through,
And the man that i want is you,
Though it's true there are
Quite a few
Who'd strongly disagree!
--- Unknown ---
Nonetheless i will marry you!
I confess that i'm frightened
To.
But unless i am wrong you
Long
For love as much as i!
This is quite unconventional,
I admit,
But why should that matter
A whit?
And if you do not say yes at
Once i think i'll die!
--- Monty ---
Miss d'ysquith, you've rendered me
Speechless! May i call you phoebe?
--- Sibella ---
What am i doing here?
This could be dangerous. If
I'm discovered,
Imagine the scandal,
And i couldn't handle
A scandal so risible.
I'll stay invisible, still as can be.
--- Unknown ---
But what's going on in there?
I can hear voices.
I recognize monty,
But is that a woman?
And if that's a woman,
Then what is she doing here?
Is it the cousin?
I wish i could see!
--- Unknown ---
If it's that cousin,
It might just be business.
It's family business,
And none of my business.
But why is she here
In the home of a bach'lor?
Of course, one could point out
That i'm here, as well!
--- Unknown ---
But does she not realize
This situation
Puts her reputation
Severely in question?
The merest suggestion
Would cause a sensation!
And i cannot hear,
Which is hell!
--- Phoebe ---
I'll be warned not to marry you!
--- Sibella ---
I could go home.
--- Phoebe ---
I'll be scorned if i marry you!
--- Sibella ---
I should go home.
--- Phoebe ---
Still, i've decided-
--- Phoebe & sibella ---
To live my life-
--- Sibella ---
And be a wife-
--- Phoebe & sibella ---
Again!
--- Phoebe ---
Who'd believe how my life
Has turned?
--- Sibella ---
I should be off
--- Phoebe ---
After grieving, i've quickly
Learned
--- Sibella ---
But he makes me laugh
--- Phoebe ---
There is
--- Phoebe & sibella ---
Nothing can bend the will
Like half-castilian men!
--- Phoebe ---
And there's goodness to
Spare in you-
--- Sibella ---
Isn't this fun?
--- Phoebe ---
And a gentleness there in you.
--- Sibella ---
Isn't she done?
--- Phoebe ---
You have taken a wounded bird
And taught her how to fly!
--- Sibella ---
Fam'ly business, my eye!
--- Phoebe & sibella ---
This is quite unconventional,
Is it not?
Rather a turn in the plot.
--- Phoebe ---
And so will i be your fiancee?!
--- Sibella ---
Why don't you send the cow
Away?
--- Monty ---
Phoebe, darling!
--- Phoebe & sibella ---
When i recall this day
I think i'll cry!
--- Phoebe ---
What was that?!
--- Monty ---
What was what?
--- Phoebe ---
That sound! Is there someone here?
--- Monty ---
Oh, pay no attention, that's...my new manservant, he's just...finding his way around.
--- Unknown ---
(toward sibella)
--- Unknown ---
I'll be with you in a moment...wadsworth.
--- Unknown ---
Isn't this madness
Who could forsee
How one trick of timing
Could ruin it all?
One in the parlor,
One in the bedroom,
Nothing between them
But me and a wall!
--- Unknown ---
Look at phoebe!
Noble and pious,
My esteem for her only grows.
But when i am with phoebe
I am on fire thinking of
Sibella!
Full of desire,
Passion, and dare i say it?
Love!
But when i'm with sibella,
Whom do i admire?
None but phoebe!
Perfect and lovely!
Who couldn't love her?
Heaven knows!
'Round and 'round and 'round
It goes!
--- Unknown ---
(to phoebe)
--- Unknown ---
How happy i'd be to be at your
Disposal,
My darling, of course, i
Accept your proposal!
--- Phoebe ---
Now we should kiss!
--- Monty ---
That would be bliss!
--- Phoebe ---
Darling, but first i'll say this:
I've decided to marry you!
--- Monty ---
Phoebe!
--- Sibella ---
What are they doing?
--- Phoebe ---
I've decided to marry you!
--- Monty ---
Sibella!
--- Sibella ---
What are they doing?!
--- Phoebe ---
Let the trumpeter call,
A wall will-
--- Unknown ---
Sibella: (at the same time)
I wish this wall would-
--- Unknown ---
Monty: (at the same time)
Phoebe!
--- Phoebe, sibella, monty ---
Fall and set me free!
--- Monty ---
Then again, there's sibella!
--- Sibella ---
Monty!
--- Phoebe ---
I've decided to marry you!
--- Monty ---
Yes, i'd be honored to marry
You!
--- Sibella ---
Monty, oh, monty!
--- Monty ---
I will marry you, phoebe!
--- Phoebe ---
I will marry you!
--- Phoebe, monty, sibella ---
Look what you've done to me!
--- Phoebe ---
Monty!
--- Monty ---
Phoebe!
--- Sibella ---
Monty!
--- Monty ---
Wadsworth!
--- Phoebe ---
Monty! Monty!
--- Sibella ---
Monty! Monty!
--- Phoebe & sibella ---
Monty! Monty! Monty! Monty!
--- Unknown ---
Monty: (to phoebe)
I'm grateful, indeed,
For your gracious bestowment!
--- Unknown ---
(to sibella)
--- Unknown ---
Yes, wadsworth, i told you,
I'll be just a moment!
--- Phoebe ---
Now, monty, dear, i think i
Now should go!
--- Monty ---
Oh? Oh!
--- Phoebe ---
But i still want to marry you!
--- Monty ---
Even so...
--- Phoebe ---
I've decided to marry you!
--- Sibella ---
Just go!
--- Phoebe ---
How i'm longing to marry you!
--- Sibella ---
Hello!
--- Monty ---
Yes, i'm delighted to marry you,
Marry you, marry-
A shame you must-
--- Unknown ---
Phoebe: (at the same time)
I've decided to marry you,
Marry you, marry-
A shame i must-
--- All ---
Go!
Go!
--- Sibella ---
Go!
--- Monty ---
Go!
--- Sibella ---
Go!
--- Phoebe ---
I'll-
--- All ---
Go!
