------ Now You Know ------
--- MARY ---
All right, now you know
Life is crummy
Well, now you know
--- Unknown ---
I mean, big surprise
People love you and tell you lies
Bricks can tumble from clear blue skies
Put your dimple down
Now you know
--- Unknown ---
So life lays you low
Learn to live with it
Now you know
--- Unknown ---
It's called flowers wilt
It's called apples rot
It's called thieves get rich snd saints get shot
It's called God don't answer prayers a lot
Okay, now you know
--- Unknown ---
Okay, now you know
Now forget it—
Don't fall apart at the seams
It's called letting go your illusions
And don't confuse them with dreams
--- Unknown ---
If the going's slow
Don't regret it
And don't let's go to extremes
--- Unknown ---
It's called what's your choice?
It's called count to ten
It's called burn your bridges, start again
You should burn them every now and then
Or you'll never grow!
--- Unknown ---
Because now you grow
That's the killer is
Now you grow
--- Unknown ---
You're right, nothing's fair and it's all a plot
And tomorrow doesn't look too hot
Well you better look at what you got
And enjoy the show
Okay, now you know
RIght?
--- ENSEMBLE ---
Right
Right
Wrong
[MARY]
Just go with the flow
Then forget it—
Don't fall apart at the seams
It's called letting go your illusions
And don't confuse them with dreams
--- Unknown ---
If the going's slow
Don't regret it
And don't let's go to extremes
--- Unknown ---
I mean, socks have holes
I mean, roads have bumps
They make meatheads champs
And nice guys chumps
I mean, even cream of wheat has lumps
Gotta let it go
--- ENSEMBLE ---
Let it go
--- MARY ---
Because now you grow
That's the killer is
Now you grow
[ENSEMBLE]
Now you grow
--- MARY ---
You're right, nothing's fair
And it's all a plot
And tomorrow doesn't look too hot
Right, you better look at what you got
Over here, hello?
--- ENSEMBLE ---
Over here, hello?
--- MARY ---
All right, now you know
--- ENSEMBLE ---
Now you know
Now you know
Now you know
