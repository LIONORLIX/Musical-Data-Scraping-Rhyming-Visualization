Multitudes of Amys
Crowd the streets below
Avenues of Amys
Officefuls of Amys
Everywhere I go
Wonder what it means
Ho-ho,?I?wonder what it?means
I see them waiting for the?lights
Running for the bus
Milling in the stores
And hailing cabs
And disappearing?through?revolving?doors
--- Unknown ---
Multitudes of Amys
Everywhere?I look
Sentences of?Amys
Paragraphs of Amys
Filling every book
Wonder if it means I've gone to pieces
Every other word I speak is something she says
