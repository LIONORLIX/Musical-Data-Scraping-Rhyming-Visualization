------ Ten Years After I Was Born... ------
--- STEPHEN SONDHEIM, spoken ---
Ten years after I was born, my parents were divorced and my mother got custody of me, and bought a house in Doylestown, Pennsylvania.
--- Unknown ---
I was an only child, and both my parents were working parents. So because I had no sort of childhood companion, and my mother was a celebrity hunter, she knew slightly the Oscar Hammersteins, and they lived about three miles away. So she sort of foisted me on them because they had a son my own age, actually a year younger. Jimmy Hammerstein.
