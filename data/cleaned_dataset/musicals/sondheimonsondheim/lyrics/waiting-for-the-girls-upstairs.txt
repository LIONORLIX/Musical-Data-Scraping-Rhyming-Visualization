------ Waiting for the Girls Upstairs ------
--- YOUNG BUDDY ---
Hey, up there!
--- YOUNG BEN ---
Way up there!
--- YOUNG BUDDY & YOUNG BEN ---
Whaddaya say, up there?
--- BUDDY ---
Hey, up there!
--- BEN ---
Way up there!
--- BUDDY & BEN ---
Whaddaya say, up there?
--- BUDDY, spoken ---
I see it all. It's like a movie in my head that plays and plays. It isn't just the bad things I remember. It's the whole damn show
Waiting around for the girls upstairs
After the curtain came down—
Money in my pocket to spend
Honey, could you maybe get a friend for my friend?
--- BEN ---
Hearing the sound of the girls above
Dressing to go on the town—
--- BUDDY ---
Clicking heels on steel and cem?nt—
--- BEN ---
Picking up the giggles floating down through the v?nt—
--- BEN & BUDDY ---
Goddamnedest hours that I ever spent
Were waiting for the girls upstairs
--- BUDDY ---
Hey, up there!
--- BEN ---
Way up there!
--- BUDDY ---
Whaddaya say, up there?
--- BEN ---
That's where the keys hung and
That's where you picked up your mail...
[BUDDY]
I remember...
Me and Ben
Me and Ben
We'd come around at ten
Me and Ben
And hang around the wings
Watching things
With what-the-hell-was-his-name
You know, the old guy—?
Max! I remember!
--- Unknown ---
Anyway
There we'd stay
Until the curtain fell
And when the curtain fell
Then all hell broke:
--- Unknown ---
Girls on the run
And scenery flying
Doors slamming left and right—
--- BEN ---
Girls in their un-
Dies, blushing but trying
Not to duck out of sight—
[BEN, BUDDY]
Girls by the hun-
Dreds waving and crying
See you tomorrow night!
--- Unknown ---
Girls looking frazzled and girls looking great
Girls in a frenzy to get to a date
Girls like a madhouse and two of them late...
And who had to wait?
And wait?
And wait
And wait
--- PHYLLIS ---
Waiting around for the boys downstairs
Stalling as long as we dare
Which dress from my wardrobe of two?
--- SALLY ---
Holding our ground for the boys below
Fussing around with our hair—
--- PHYLLIS ---
Giggling, wriggling out of our tights
--- SALLY ---
Chattering and clattering down all of those flights—
--- SALLY & PHYLLIS ---
God, I'd forgotten there ever were nights
Of waiting for the boys downstairs
--- BEN & BUDDY ---
You up there!
--- SALLY ---
Down in a minute!
--- BEN & BUDDY ---
You two up there!
--- PHYLLIS ---
Just keep your shirts on!
--- BEN & BUDDY ---
Aren't you through up there?
--- SALLY & PHYLLIS ---
Heard you the first time!
--- BEN & BUDDY ---
Look, are you coming or
Aren't you coming 'cause
Look, if we're going
We
Got to get going 'cause
Look, they won't hold us
A table at ringside
All night
--- SALLY & PHYLLIS ---
Coming, we're coming
Will you hold your horses
We're coming, we're ready, be
There in a jiffy, we're
Coming, we're coming
All right!
--- YOUNG SALLY ---
Hi
--- YOUNG BEN ---
Girls...
--- YOUNG PHYLLIS ---
Ben...
--- YOUNG BUDDY ---
Sally...
--- YOUNG SALLY ---
Boy, we're beat
--- YOUNG BUDDY ---
You look neat
--- YOUNG PHYLLIS ---
We saw you in the wings
--- YOUNG BEN ---
How are things?
--- YOUNG PHYLLIS ---
Did someone pass you in?
--- YOUNG BUDDY ---
Slipped a fin
To what-the-hell-was-his-name
You know, the doorman
--- YOUNG PHYLLIS ---
Al?
--- YOUNG BUDDY ---
No
--- YOUNG SALLY ---
Big?
--- YOUNG BUDDY ---
Fat
--- YOUNG PHYLLIS ---
Young?
--- YOUNG BUDDY ---
Bald
--- YOUNG SALLY ---
Harry!
--- YOUNG BUDDY ---
Yeah
--- YOUNG SALLY ---
Okey doaks
--- YOUNG BUDDY ---
Come on, folks
--- YOUNG PHYLLIS ---
And where we're gonna go?
--- YOUNG BEN ---
A little joint I know
--- YOUNG SALLY ---
What?
--- YOUNG BUDDY ---
Great new show there
--- YOUNG PHYLLIS ---
Hey, I thought you said
Tonight's be Tony's—
--- YOUNG BUDDY ---
This joint is just as grand
--- YOUNG SALLY ---
We girls got dressed for
Dancing at Tony's—
--- YOUNG BEN ---
This joint is in demand
--- YOUNG SALLY & YOUNG PHYLLIS ---
Ta-ta, goodbye, you'll
Find us at Tony's—
--- YOUNG BUDDY & YOUNG BEN ---
Wait till you hear the band!
--- YOUNG SALLY & YOUNG PHYLLIS ---
You told us Tony's
That we'd go to Tony's
Then Ben mentioned Tony's—
Well, someone said Tony's
--- YOUNG BUDDY & YOUNG BEN ---
I told you Tony's?
I never said Tony's!
--- ALL WOMEN ---
There's dancing at Tony's—
All right, then, we'll go!
--- ALL MEN ---
When's Ben mentioned Tony's?
It's ritzy at Tony's—
All right, then, we'll go!
--- BUDDY ---
Waiting around for the girls upstairs
Weren't we chuckleheads then?
--- BEN ---
Very young and very old hat—
Everybody has to go through stages like that
--- BUDDY, BEN, SALLY & PHYLLIS ---
Waiting around for the girls upstairs—
Thank you, but never again
Life was fun, but oh, so intense
Everything was possible and nothing made sense
--- ALL ---
Back there when one of the major events
Was waiting for the girls
Waiting for the girls
