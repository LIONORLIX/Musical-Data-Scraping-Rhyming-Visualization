------ Good Thing Going ------
--- CHARLEY ---
It started out like a song
We started quiet and slow
With no surprise
And then one morning I woke
To realize
We had a good thing going
--- It's not that nothing went wrong ---
Some angry moments, of course
But just a few
And only moments, no more
Because we knew
We had this good thing going
--- Unknown ---
And if I wanted too much
Was that such
A mistake
At the time?
You never wanted enoughâ€”
All right, tough
I don't make
That a crime
--- Unknown ---
And while it's going along
You take for granted some love
Will wear away
We took for granted a lot
But still I say:
It could hav? kept on growing
Instead of just kept on
W? had a good thing going
Going
