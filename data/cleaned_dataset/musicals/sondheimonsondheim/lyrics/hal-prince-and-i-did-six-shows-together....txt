------ Hal Prince and I Did Six Shows Together... ------
--- STEPHEN SONDHEIM, spoken ---
Hal Prince and I did six shows together. The last one we did on Broadway was called Merrily We Roll Along. And the irony of that being the last show that we did together was that Merrily We Roll Along deals with a partnership. It's a partnership between two songwriters that splits and they go their separate ways.
