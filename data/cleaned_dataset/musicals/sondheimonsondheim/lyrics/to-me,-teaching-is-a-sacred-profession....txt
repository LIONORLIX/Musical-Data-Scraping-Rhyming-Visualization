------ To Me, Teaching Is a Sacred Profession... ------
--- STEPHEN SONDHEIM, spoken ---
To me, teaching is a sacred profession. My life was shaped by teachers. First by a Latin teacher in prep school. Then by a man called Robert Barrow who taught music at Williams College and made me a musician. And then my postgraduate studies with Milton Babbitt. And then of course my collaborators. And I suppose, above all, Oscar, who taught me virtually everything I know about songwriting, and a good deal about life.
