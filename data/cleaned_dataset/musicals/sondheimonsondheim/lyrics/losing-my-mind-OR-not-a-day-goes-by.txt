------ Losing My Mind / Not a Day Goes By ------
--- SALLY ---
The sun comes up
I think about you
The coffee cup
I think about you
I want you so
It's like I'm losing my mind
--- Unknown ---
The morning ends
I think about you
I talk to friends
I think about you
And do they know
It's like I'm losing my mind?
--- Unknown ---
All afternoon
Doing every little chore
The thought of you stays bright
Sometimes I stand in the middle of the floor
Not going left
Not going right
--- Unknown ---
I dim the lights
And think about you
Spend sleepless nights
To think about you
You said you loved me
Or were you just being kind?
Or am I losing my mind?
--- BETH ---
Not a day goes by
Not a single day
But you're somewhere a part of my life
And it looks like you'll stay
--- Unknown ---
As the days go by
I keep thinking, when does it end?
Where's the day I'll have started forgetting?
--- Unknown ---
But I just go on
Thinking and sweating
And cursing and crying
And turning and reaching
And waking and dying
And no
Not a day goes by
Not a blessed day
But you're still somewhere part of my life
And you won't go away
--- Unknown ---
So there's hell to pay
And until I die
I'll die day after day
After day after day
After day after day
After day
Till the days go by!

The thought of you stays bright
Sometimes I stand in the middle of the floor
Not going left

--- BETH ---
No, not a day goes by
--- SALLY ---
I dim the lights
And think about you
--- BETH ---
Not a single day
--- SALLY ---
Spend sleepless nights
To think about you
--- BETH ---
And no
--- SALLY ---
I want you so
It's like I'm losing my mind
[BETH]
I keep thinking when does it end?
--- SALLY ---
Does no one know
It's like losing my mind?
--- BETH ---
Where's the day I'll have started forgetting?
--- SALLY & BETH ---
You said you loved me
Or were you just being kind?
--- BETH ---
Not a day goes by
--- SALLY ---
Or am I losing my mind?
--- BETH ---
I'll die day after day
After day after day
After day
