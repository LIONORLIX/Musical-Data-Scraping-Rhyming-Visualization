------ Love Is in the Air ------
--- PROLOGUS & PROTEANS ---
Love is in the air
Quite clearly
People everywhere
Act queerly
Some are hasty, some are halting
Some are simply somersaulting
Love is going around
--- Unknown ---
Anyone exposed
Can catch it
Keep your window closed
And latch it
Leave your house and lose your reason
This is the contagious season
Love is going around
--- Unknown ---
La la la
La la la
--- STEPHEN SONDHEIM, spoken ---
That song was called Love Is In the Air and George Abbott could hum it. And that's what we opened with in New Haven. And the show was a disaster. And we didn't know what was wrong with it. The book seemed to be funny, but the audience wasn't laughing. Nobody was having a good time. We got down in Washington. The show was still a disaster.
