------ Take Me to the World ------
--- ELLA ---
Let me see the world
With clouds
Take me to the world
Out where I can push
Through crowdsâ€”
Take me to the world
--- Unknown ---
A world of skies
That's bursting with surprise
To open up my eyes
For joy
--- Unknown ---
Take me to the world
That's real
Show me how it's done
Teach me how to laugh
To feel
Move me to the sun
--- Unknown ---
Just hold my hand
Whenever we arrive
Take me to the world
Where I can be alive
--- Unknown ---
We shall see the world come tru?
We shall have the world
I won't b? afraid with you
We shall have the world
--- Unknown ---
I'll hold your hand
And know I'm not alone
We shall have the world
To keep
Such a lovely world
We'll weep
We shall have the world
Forever
