------ Invocation/Forget War ------
--- PROLOGUS ---
Gods of the theater, smile on us
You who sit up there stern in judgment, smile?on?us
You who look?down on actors
And who doesn't?
Bless our?little company and smile on us
Think not about deep concerns
Think?not?about?dark dilemmas
--- PROLOGUS & COMPANY ---
We offer?you song and?dance
We offer you rites and revels
We offer you jokes and insults
We offer you grace and beauty
Bless our play and smile
--- COMPANY ---
Forget war, forget woe
Forget matters weighty and great
Allow matters weighty to wait
For a while
For this moment, this brief time
Frown on reason, smile on rhyme
--- Unknown ---
Forget pomp, forget show
Forget laurels, helmets and crowns
Receive lovers, liars and clowns
For a while
For this moment, this brief span
Celebrate the state of man
