------ Anyone Can Whistle ------
--- COMPANY, variously ---
Anyone can whistle
That's what they say—
Easy
Anyone can whistle
Any old day—
Easy
--- Unknown ---
It's all so simple
Relax, let go, let fly
So someone tell me why
Can't I?
--- Unknown ---
I can dance a tango
I can read Greek—
Easy
I can slay a dragon
Any old week—
Easy
--- Unknown ---
What's hard is simple
What's natural comes hard
Maybe you could show me
How to let go
Lower my guard
Learn to be free
Maybe if you whistle
