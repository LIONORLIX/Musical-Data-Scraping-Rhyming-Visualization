------ Talent/When I Get Famous ------
--- Part 1: Talent ---
--- Unknown ---
When I was a tyke
I said, What I like
Is art
I know I'm a boy
But what I enjoy
Is art
--- Unknown ---
Looking at paintings, going to plays
Music and books informing my days
Filling my mind
Flooding my heart
With art!
--- Unknown ---
I had this dream of becoming an artist—
A painter, a poet, who knows?
I had a nice little talent for drawing
And a natural feeling for prose
I even began to compose
--- Part 2: When I Get Famous ---
--- Unknown ---
Ever since I can remember
I've had a secret dream in my heart
Looking forward
To the day I could start
My climb up the path
The path to the stars
The stars of acclaim, applause, and fame
--- Unknown ---
When I get famous, I'll be free
On my own, you wait and see
Lost or dependent I'll never b?
I'll get there alon?, somehow
When I get famous
Everybody will bow
Let them laugh at me now
For they can't shake my dream
--- Unknown ---
Once the chance comes I'll take my cue
One good break, I'm telling you
