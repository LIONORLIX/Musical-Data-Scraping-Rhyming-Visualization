------ So Many People ------
--- WOMAN ---
I said the man for me
Must have a castle
A man of means he'd be
A man of fame
And then I met a man who hadn't any
Without a penny
To his name
--- Unknown ---
I had to go and fall
For so much less than
What I had planned from all
The magazines
--- Unknown ---
I should be good and sore
What am I happy for?
I guess the man means more
Than the means
--- MAN ---
So many people in the world
And what can they do?
They'll never know love
Like my love for you
So many people laugh
At what they don't knowâ€”
But that's their concern
If just a few, say half
A million or so
Could see us, they'd learn
--- WOMAN & MAN ---
So many people in the world
Don't know what they've missed
They'd never believe
Such joy could exist
And if they tell us
It's a thing we'll outgrow
They're jealous
As they can be
That with so many people in the world
