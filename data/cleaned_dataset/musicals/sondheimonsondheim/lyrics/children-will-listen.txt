------ Children Will Listen ------
--- Unknown ---
How do you say to your child in the night
Nothing's all black but then nothing's all white?
How do you say it will all be alright
When you know that it mightn't be true?
What do you do?
--- Unknown ---
What do you leave to your child when you're dead?
Only whatever you put in its head
Things that your mother and father had said
Which were left to them too
Careful what you say
--- Unknown ---
Careful the things you say
Children will listen
Careful the things you do
Children will see
And learn

Children may not obey
But children will listen
Children will look to you
For which way to turn
To learn what to be

Careful before you say
Listen to me
Childr?n will listen

Careful the wish you mak?
Wishes are children
Careful the path they take
Wishes come true
Not free

Careful the spell you cast
Not just on children
Sometimes the spell may last
Past what you can see
And turn against you
--- Unknown ---
Careful the tale you tell
That is the spell
