------ Happiness ------
--- CLARA ---
I'm so happy
I'm afraid I'll die
Here in your arms
--- Unknown ---
What would you do
If I died
Like this—
Right now
Here in your arms?
--- Unknown ---
That we ever should have met
Is a miracle—
--- GIORGIO ---
No, inevitable—
--- CLARA ---
Then inevitable, yes
But I confess
It was the look—
--- GIORGIO ---
The look?
--- CLARA ---
The sadness in your eyes
That day
When we glanced
At each other in the park
--- GIORGIO ---
We were both unhappy
--- CLARA ---
Unhappiness can be seductive
--- GIORGIO ---
You pitied me
--- CLARA & GIORGIO ---
How quickly pity leads to lov?
--- CLARA ---
All this happiness
Merely from a glanc? in the park
So much happiness
So much love
--- GIORGIO ---
I thought I knew what love was
--- CLARA ---
I wish we might have met so much sooner
I could have given you—
--- GIORGIO ---
I thought I knew what love was
[CLARA]
—My youth
--- GIORGIO ---
I thought I knew how much I could feel
--- CLARA ---
All the time we lost...
--- GIORGIO ---
I didn't know what love was
--- CLARA ---
I've never known what love was
--- GIORGIO ---
But now—
--- CLARA ---
And now—
--- CLARA & GIORGIO ---
— I do
It's what I feel with you
The happiness I feel with you
[CLARA]
So much happiness—
--- GIORGIO ---
You are so beautiful...
--- CLARA ---
—Happening by chance
In a park
--- GIORGIO ---
Not by chance
By necessity—
--- CLARA ---
Surely, this is happiness—
--- GIORGIO ---
By the sadness that we saw
In each other
--- CLARA ---
—No one else
Has ever felt before!
--- CLARA & GIORGIO ---
Just another love story
That's what they would claim
Another simple love story—
Aren't all of them the same?
--- CLARA ---
No, but this is more
We feel more!
--- CLARA & GIORGIO ---
This is so much more!
Like every other love story
--- Unknown ---
Some say happiness
Comes and goes
Then this happiness
Is a kind of happiness
No one really knows
--- GIORGIO ---
I thought I knew what love was
--- CLARA ---
I'd only heard what love was
--- GIORGIO ---
I thought it was no more than a name
For yearning
--- CLARA ---
I thought it was what kindness became
--- GIORGIO ---
I'm learning—
--- CLARA ---
I thought where there was love there was shame
--- GIORGIO ---
—That with you—
--- CLARA ---
But with you—
--- BOTH ---
—There's just happiness
--- CLARA ---
