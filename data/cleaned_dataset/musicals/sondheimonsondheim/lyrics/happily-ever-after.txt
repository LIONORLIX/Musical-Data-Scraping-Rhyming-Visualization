------ Happily Ever After ------
--- ROBERT ---
Someone to hold you too close
Someone to hurt you too deep
Someone to love you too hard
Happily ever after
--- Unknown ---
Someone to need you too much
Someone to read you too well
Someone to bleed you of all
The things you don't want to tellâ€”
That's happily ever after
Ever, ever, ever after
In hell
--- STEPHEN SONDHEIM, spoken ---
