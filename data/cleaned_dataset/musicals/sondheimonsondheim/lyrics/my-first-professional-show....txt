------ My First Professional Show... ------
--- STEPHEN SONDHEIM, spoken ---
My first professional show, which is when I was twenty-three years old, was called Saturday Night. It was based on a play called Front Porch in Flatbush, which had been written by two well-known screenwriters, Philip and Julius Epstein. They had among other things written Casablanca. And they had written about their childhood in Brooklyn.
