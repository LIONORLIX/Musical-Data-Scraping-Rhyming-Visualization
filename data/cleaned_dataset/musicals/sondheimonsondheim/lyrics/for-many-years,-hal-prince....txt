------ For Many Years, Hal Prince... ------
--- STEPHEN SONDHEIM, spoken ---
For many years, Hal Prince was a producer on Broadway before he became a director. And in fact he co-produced West Side Story and A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum. But the first time we worked together with him as a director was on Company. That was in 1969.

--- STEPHEN SONDHEIM, spoken ---
Company is a show about marriage. And I had never been married, either officially or unofficially, when I wrote Company. I thought, how am I gonna write about something I know nothing about? I've observed marriages, and I have feelings and opinions and insights, but I don't know anything about it.
