------ Loving You ------
--- FOSCA ---
Loving you
Is not a choice
It's who I am
--- Unknown ---
Loving you
Is not a choice
And not much reason
To rejoice
But it gives me purpose
Gives me voice
To say to the world:
--- Unknown ---
This is why I live
You are why I live
--- Unknown ---
Loving you
Is why I do
The things I do
Loving you
Is not in my
Control
But loving you
I have a goal
For what's left of my life...
--- Unknown ---
I will live
And I would die
