------ The Best Thing That Ever Has Happened ------
--- STEPHEN SONDHEIM, spoken ---
John Weidman and I wrote a show called Bounce which was about the Mizner brothers—two guys who lived in the early part of the, uh, twentieth century and had a minor?cultural?impact?on this country.?That show became?another show called Road Show. And one of the changes occurred in a love song that was originally sung by Wilson, the older brother and his lady friend. And I rewrote it for Road Show so that Addison, his younger brother, could sing it to his boyfriend.
--- WILSON ---
You are the best thing that ever has happened to me
--- NELLIE ---
Bullshit
--- WILSON ---
Okay then, one of th? best things that's happened to m?
--- NELLIE ---
Bullshit
--- WILSON ---
To think Id meet someone
Who could surprise me
And size me up without cutting me down—
--- WILSON & NELLIE ---
Ain't this a town?
--- NELLIE ---
You are the god-damnedest thing that has happened to me
Ever
When did I have this much happiness happen to me?
Never
--- WILSON ---
I can't believe my luck
And all I can do
Is be the best thing that's happened to you
--- NELLIE & HOLLIS ---
So what do you say
We just stay home?
What do you say we just go
Out on the boat and get smashed
And make love on the beach
And stare up at the moon—?
--- ADDISON ---
You might just be the best thing that has happened to me
So far
Of course not much very good's ever happened to me
So far
--- HOLLIS ---
I didn't much like love
I always fought it
I never thought it
Would happen like this
--- ADDISON ---
Give us a kiss
[WILSON, ADDISON, NELLIE & HOLLIS]
We may just be the best thing that has happened to us—
--- WILSON ---
Kiddo
--- ADDISON ---
Partner
--- WILSON, ADDISON, NELLIE & HOLLIS ---
Another moment like this may not happen to us—
--- NELLIE ---
Partner
--- HOLLIS ---
Lover
--- WILSON, ADDISON, NELLIE & HOLLIS ---
When all is said and done
I have to agree
You are the best thing that's happened to me
--- WILSON & HOLLIS ---
Who knew?
[ADDISON & NELLIE]
Who dreamed?
