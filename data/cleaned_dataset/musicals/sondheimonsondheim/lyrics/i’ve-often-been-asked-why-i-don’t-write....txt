------ I’ve Often Been Asked Why I Don’t Write... ------
--- STEPHEN SONDHEIM, spoken ---
I've often been asked why don't I write my own librettos, because often the songs seem to be libretto-like songs. And there are two reasons. The first, and more important one, is that I think playwriting is too difficult and I don't think I could ever write a play.
