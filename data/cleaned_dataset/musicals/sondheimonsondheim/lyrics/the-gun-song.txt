------ The Gun Song ------
--- CZOLGOSZ ---
It takes a lot of men to make a gun
Hundreds
Many men to make a gun:
--- Unknown ---
Men in the mines
To dig the iron
Men in the mills
To forge the steel
Men at machines
To turn the barrel
Mold the trigger
Shape the wheel—
It takes a lot of men to make a gun...
One gun...
--- BOOTH ---
And all you have to do
Is move your little finger
Move your little finger and—
You can change the world
--- Unknown ---
Why should you be blue
When you've your little finger?
Prove how just a littl? finger
Can—
Change the world
--- GUITEAU ---
What a wond?r is a gun
What a versatile invention
First of all, when you've a gun—
Everybody pays attention
--- Unknown ---
When you think what must be done
Think of all that it can do:
Remove a scoundrel
Unite a party
Preserve the union
Promote the sales of my book
Ensure my future
My niche in history
And then the world will see
That I am not a man to overlook!
Ha-ha!
--- MOORE ---
I got this really great gun—
Shit, where is it?
No, it's really great—
Wait—
Shit, where is it?
Anyway—
It's just a .38—
But—
It's a gun
You can make a state—
Ment—
Wrong—
With a gun
Even if you fail
It tells 'em who you are
Where you stand
This one was on sale
It—
No, not the shoe—!
Well, actually the shoe was, too
No, that's not it—
Shit, I had it here—
Got it!
Yeah! There it is!
And—
--- CZOLGOSZ. BOOTH, GUITEAU & MOORE ---
All you have to do
Is crook your little finger
Hook your little finger 'round—
--- MOORE ---
Shit, I shot it...
--- CZOLGOSZ. BOOTH & GUITEAU ---
—You can change the world
Change the world...
[CZOLGOSZ. BOOTH, GUITEAU & MOORE, variously]
Simply follow through
And look, your little finger
Can slow them down
To a crawl
Show them all
Big and small
It took a little finger
No time
To change the world
--- CZOLGOSZ ---
A gun kills many men before it's done
Hundreds
Long before you shoot the gun
--- Unknown ---
Men in the mines
And in the steel mills
Men at machines
Who died for what?
Something to buy
A watch, a shoe, a gun
A thing to make the bosses richer
But
A gun claims many men before it's done
--- CZOLGOSZ. BOOTH, GUITEAU & MOORE ---
Just one...
