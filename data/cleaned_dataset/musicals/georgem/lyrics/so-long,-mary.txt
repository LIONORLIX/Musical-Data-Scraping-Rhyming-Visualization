------ So Long, Mary ------
--- Unknown ---
"It's awfully nice of all of you to meet me at the train."
So long, Mary.
I didn't think you'd care if you should ne'er see me again.
You're wrong, Mary.
This reminds me of my family,
On the day I left Schenectady.
To the depot then they came with me
I seem to hear them say:
--- Unknown ---
'So long, Mary
Mary, we will miss you so!
So long, Mary
How we hate to see you go.
And we'll all be longing for you, Mary,
While you roam.
So long, Mary
Don't forget to come back home.'
--- Unknown ---
"It's awfully nice of all you boys to see me off today."
So long, Mary.
I didn't think you'd care
If I should wither, go or stay.
You're wrong, Mary.
Yes, I'm going to other lands to dwell
Awfully nice of you to wish me well.
Hardly thought a soul in New Rochelle
Would even come to say:
'So long, Mary
Mary, we will miss you so!
So long, Mary
How we hate to see you go.
And we'll all be longing for you, Mary,
While you roam.
So long, Mary
