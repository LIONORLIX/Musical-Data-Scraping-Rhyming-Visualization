------ Give My Regards To Broadway ------
--- Unknown ---
Give my regards to Broadway,
Remember me to Herald Square;
Tell all the gang at 42nd Street,
That I will soon be there.
Whisper of how I'm yearning
To mingle with the old time throng;
Give my regards to old Broadway,
And say that I'll be there e'er long.

Give my regards to Broadway,
Remember me to Herald Square;
Tell all the gang at 42nd Street,
That I will soon be there.
Whisper of how I'm yearning
To mingle with the old time throng;
Give my regards to old Broadway,
And say that I'll be there e'er long.
Did you ever see two Yankees part upon a foreign shore?
When the good ship's just about to start for Old New York once more?
With tear dimmed eye, they say goodbye
They're friends, without a doubt;
When the man on the pier shouts, Let them clear!
As the ship strikes out.

Whisper of how I'm yearning
To mingle with the old time throng!
Give my regards to Old Broadway
And say that I'll be there, 'ere long!
