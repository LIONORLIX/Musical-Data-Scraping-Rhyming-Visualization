------ Yankee Doodle Dandy ------
--- Unknown ---
I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy,
A Yankee Doodle do or die;
A real live nephew of my Uncle Sam's.
Born on the Fourth of July.
I've got a Yankee Doodle sweetheart,
She's my Yankee Doodle joy.
Yankee Doodle came to London,
Just to ride the ponies,
I'm a Yankee Doodle boy.

I'm the kid that's all the candy,
I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy
I'm glad I am!
So's Uncle Sam!
--- Unknown ---
I'm a real live Yankee Doodle,
Made my name and fame and boodle,
Just like Mister Doodle did by riding on a pony
--- Unknown ---
I love to listen to the Dixie Strain,
I long to see the girl I left behind me;
And that ain't a josh, she's a Yankee, by gosh!
--- Unknown ---
Oh, say can you see...
Anything about a Yankee that's a phoney?
--- Unknown ---
I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy!
A Yankee Doodle Do or Die!
A real live nephew of my Uncle Sam's
Born on the Fourth of July!

I've got a Yankee Doodle Sweetheart
She's my Yankee Doodle Joy
