------ Beautiful ------
--- MARIE CHRISTINE ---
He was a stranger;
He was lost up in Pont Chartrain
Said he was looking for a pretty smile;
Would I oblige?
I obliged.
A little voice said: 'Danger.'
But it's Sunday in Pont Chartrain
I'm fanning myself down in Blue Rose Park.
He comes by;
Wrinkled shirt.
Piece of work.
I oblige.
Beautiful,
I'd never seen such beautiful,
I'd never seen such arrogance,
I'd never seen such loneliness.
He comes along so powerful,
I'd never felt so powerless.
I'd never seen such beautiful...
