--- Unknown ---
Lover, Bring Me Summer
--- MARIE CHRISTINE ---
To find a lover
I have something you must do
blood of your father,
the blood of your father.
--- DAUGHTERS ---
Lover bring me summer
Steal it if you dare;
Give me August,
give me warmth
and rose-maid for my hair.
I won't question the goodness you bring.
I won't question the fruit you bear.
Lover bring me summer,
give me the sun
