Mamzell' Marie
--- MARIE CHRISTINE ---
She knew the secrets of Santo Domingo,
medicines,
spells.
She knew the secrets of Mother Africa,
powerful,
healing,
God-revealing.
And those who would believe were heard.
Servants who envied their masters,
upper-class women, wealthy and white,
young men hungry for lovers;
she spoke to their hearts.
She answered their need,
ou-ai ye, mamzell' Marie.
