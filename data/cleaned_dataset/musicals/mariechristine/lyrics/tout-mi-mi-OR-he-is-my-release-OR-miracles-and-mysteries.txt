Will you fall under the spell of another?

Once you fall under the spell of another
You will lose yourself
As I lost myself
I lost myself to love, Marie
Will you lie for the sake of him?
And will you dream of anyone else but him?
There is no end to what you?ll do for him

To enter paradise, you have to sacrifice
ev?ry reason, ev?ry privilege,
ev?ry caution, ev?ry heartbeat
for the miracles and mysteries of love
