------ From This Moment On ------
--- Unknown ---
From this moment on,
You for me dear,
Only two for tea dear,
From this moment on,
--- Unknown ---
From this happy day,
No more blue songs,
Only hoop-de-doo songs,
From this moment on
--- Unknown ---
You've got the love I need so much
Got the skin I love to touch
Got the arms to hold me tight
Got the sweet lips to kiss me goodnight
--- Unknown ---
From this moment on
You and I babe
We'll be ridin' high babe
Every care is gone
From this moment on.

This very moment,
