------ Brush up Your Shakespeare ------
--- MOBSTERS ---
The girls today in society
Go for classical poetry,
So to win their hearts one must quote with ease
Aeschylus and Euripides.
But the poet of them all
Who will start 'em simply ravin'
Is the poet people call
The bard of Stratford-on-Avon.

Brush up your Shakespeare,
Start quoting him now.
Brush up your Shakespeare
And the women you will wow.
Just declaim a few lines from Othella
And they think you're a helluva fella.
If your blonde won't respond when you flatter 'er
Tell her what Tony told Cleopaterer ,
If she fights when her clothes you are mussing,
What are clothes? Much Ado About Nussing.
Brush up your Shakespeare
And they'll all kowtow.

With the wife of the British embessida
Try a crack out of Troilus and Cressida,
If she says she won't buy it or tike it
Make her tike it, what's more, As You Like It.
If she says your behavior is heinous
Kick her right in the Coriolanus.
Brush up your Shakespeare
And they'll all kowtow,
And they'll all kowtow,
