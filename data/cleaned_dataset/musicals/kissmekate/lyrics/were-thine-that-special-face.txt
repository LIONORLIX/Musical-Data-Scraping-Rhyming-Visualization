------ Were Thine That Special Face ------
--- PETRUCHIO ---
Were thine that special face
The face that fills my dreaming,
Were thine the rhythm'd grace,
Were thine the form so lithe and slender,
Were thine the arms so warm, so tender,
Were thine the kiss divine,
Were thine the love for me,
The love which fills my dreaming,
When all these charms are thine
Then you'll be mine, all mine.

I wrote a poem
In classic style.
I wrote it with my tongue in my cheek
And my lips in a smile.
But of late my poem
Has a meaning so new,
For to my surprise
It suddenly applies
To my darling--to you.
