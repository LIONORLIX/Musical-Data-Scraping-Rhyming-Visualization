When you gonna learn boy?
What's the use of gettin sober
when you're gonna get drunk again
--- NOMAX ---
Exactly
you know, old sam did something mighty fine
when he brought back good whiskey, beer and wine
because I love my whiskey and I love my gin
every time you see me I'll be in the sin
--- BIG MOE ---
Don't you think you already deep enough in sin?
When you gonna learn Max?
What's the use of gettin sober
when you're gonna get drunk again
--- NOMAX ---
Hey you know Big Moe
I went out last night about half past one
I thought I'd whoop it up a little bit, you know,
have me some fun
--- BIG MOE ---
I understand
--- NOMAX ---
So I got me a half a pint about half past two
Now after I drank that you know what I wanted to do
--- BIG MOE ---
Sleep
--- NOMAX ---
Uh, uh, then I got me a pint about half past four
now after i drank that I just wanted some more
so then I got me a quart
--- BIG MOE ---
Oh a quart
--- NOMAX ---
Yes about half past five
now after I drank that,
ooh, I didn't know if I was dead or alive
--- BIG MOE ---
I think more dead than alive
When you gonna learn Max?
What's the use of gettin sober
when you're gonna get drunk again
God I hope this boy learns, lord have mercy
--- NOMAX ---
