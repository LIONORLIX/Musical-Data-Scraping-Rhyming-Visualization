Gone and got the blues in Paris
Paris blues called Azure te
How could I be blue in Paris?
Easy, coz she's far away
can't lose these blues, this Azure te
--- Unknown ---
Sidewalk tables are filled with people
always happy, always gay
still I'm alone, alone in Paris
praying she'll come back to stay
can't lose those blues, this Azure te

can't lose those blues, this Azure te

If you knew how much I need you
you'd come back to me and stay
I need you with me in Paris
really is the only way
to lose these blues, this Azure te
--- Unknown ---
Ah, must lose those blues,
this azure te
must lose these blues,
this azure te
can't lose these blues,
