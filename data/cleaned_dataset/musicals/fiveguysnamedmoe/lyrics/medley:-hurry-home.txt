------ Medley: Hurry Home ------
--- BIG MOE ---
I had to call you on the phone
because I feel so all alone
--- EAT MOE ---
Don't like this being on my own
cantcha, wontcha hurry home
--- Unknown ---
I KNOW WHAT I'VE GOT
--- NOMAX ---
Everything was fine
then I got out of line
--- NO MOE ---
But still 'n' all I'm sticking like glue
coz I know what I've got
but I don't know what I'm gettin'
so baby I'm with you.
--- FOUR EYED MOE ---
I made an awful big mistake
oh what a difference love can make
please give my heart another break
cantcha, wontcha hurry home.
--- Unknown ---
I've learned a lot that I didn't know
I was a fool when I let you go
--- LITTLE MOE ---
Since you've been gone it's all very clear
--- ALL ---
Life is just an empty thing without you dear
--- IS YOU IS OR IS YOU AINT MY BABY ---
--- All ---
Is you is or is you ain't my baby?
The way you're acting lately makes me doubt
Is you is or is you ain't my baby?
Seems my flame in your hearts done gone out.
--- Unknown ---
my friends say I could do a lot better
if this keeps up I'll soon need a nurse
I know I can't do any better
but believe me I could do a lot worse.
--- Unknown ---
Is you is or is you ain't my baby?
The way you're acting lately makes me doubt
Is you is or is you ain't my baby?
Seems my flame in your hearts done gone out
When the moon goes down in the dawnin'
and the sun comes up in the mornin'
don't let the sun catch you cryin'
when the moon goes down in the dawnin'
don't let the sun catch you cryin'
if your baby don't want you no more,
no more,
no more,
------ fin ------
