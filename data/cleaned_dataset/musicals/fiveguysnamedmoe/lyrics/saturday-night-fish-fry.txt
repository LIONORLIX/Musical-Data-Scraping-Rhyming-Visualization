------ Saturday Night Fish Fry ------
--- LITTLE MOE ---
If you ever been down to New Orleans
then you can understand just what I mean,
all through the week it's as quiet as a mouse
but on a saturday night they go from house to house
you don't have to pay the usual admission
if you're a cook, a waiter or a good musician
so if you happen to to be just passin' by
stop in at the saturday night fish fry.

Now my buddy and me we fell right in
and we hollered Let the joy begin
we knew this was the right place to play
coz the party was already under way
but all of a sudden the lights went low
and everybody made straight for the front door
man, I was scared I didn't know where to go
so I stood right there then I fell on the floor.

Now the women was screamin' and jumpin' and yellin'
the bottles was flyin' and the fish was smellin'
and way up above all the noise they made
somebody hollered
--- BIG MOE ---
Better get outta here, it's a raid!
--- LITTLE MOE ---
I didn't know we was breakin' the law
but somebody reached up and hit me on the jaw
they had us blocked off from the front to the back
and they were puttin' them in the wagon like potato sacks.

I knew I could get away if I had a chance
but I was shakin' like I had the saint Vitus dance
I tried to crawl up underneath a bathtub
but a policeman said
--- BIG MOE ---
Where you going now bud?
--- LITTLE MOE ---
They got us out of there like a house on fire
and put us all in that black Maria
they might have missed a pitiful few
but they got both me and my buddy too

We headed for the jail in a dazed condition
they booked each one of us on suspicion
my chick came down and went my bail
and finally got me outta that rotten jail
so if you ever want to get a fist in your eye
just mention a saturday night fish fry
I don't care how many fish in the sea
but don't ever mention fish to me!
