I wanna sing something beautiful.

Ok, honey, that's enough.
--- ANDREA ---
I wanna sing something positive.
--- JERRY (spoken) ---
Why don't we carry this on in the Green Room?
--- ANDREA ---
I wanna learn how to dream again,
To feel again.
--- JERRY (spoken) ---
Look, we've really got to wind this up now.
--- ANDREA ---
I wanna stand on top...

Thank you.

--- ANDREA ---
In the arms of my lover,
Bathed in the light of rainbows,
With Spring in my heart,
And love by my side,
Oh, stay with me,
Stay with me,
Stay with me,
Baby.
Stay with me,
Stay with me,
Stay with me,
