Zandra, Peaches has been your best friend since childhood,
why would you cheat on your best friend?

He'd come round, know what I'm sayin, know what I'm sayin.
When he was stressed, know what Im sayin, know what Im sayin.
I would sympathise. Sympathise. Know what Im sayin, know what Im sayin?

--- JERRY (spoken) ---
Peaches, your partner has cheated on you,
your best friend has betrayed you,
you don't have to put up with this, you're the innocent one here!
--- PEACHES ---
A weird thing happened last night when I went to take a leak.
I ended up pissing on a man with a glorious physique.
I said, what on Earth are you doing on the restroom floor?
He said, dont ask stupid questions,
just piss on me some more, piss on me you whore.
I pissed, some more.
--- Unknown ---
I guess we all got our flaws, Jerry.
--- JERRY (spoken) ---
I'm confused here, so are you gonna take him back?
--- PEACHES ---
Uh huh, uh huh, uh huh!
--- DWIGHT ---
Baby, I love you!
--- JERRY (spoken) ---
Well I guess you got away with it this time, Dwight!
--- VALKYRIE ---
Jerry! Jerry!
--- JERRY (spoken) ---
It's okay, my inner-Valkyrie. What can I do for you today?
--- VALKYRIE ---
Jerry lets the morons fight, but how does Jerry sleep at night?
--- JERRY (spoken) ---
How do I sleep? I sleep on my back, thank you.
You know it's easy to occupy the moral high ground, what's more difficult is
to confidently occupy the moral low ground! Go away!
--- Unknown ---
Now Dwight, you told producers before the show that you have another secret?
--- DWIGHT ---
Baby, there's one more thing.
--- PEACHES ---
Uh huh?

One more, baby there's on more baby there's...
