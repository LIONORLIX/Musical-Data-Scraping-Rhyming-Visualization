------ I Just Wanna Dance ------
--- ENSEMBLE ---
Dance, dance, dance, dance,
Dance, dance, dance, dance
Strip slut, shake that booty!
Strip slut, shake that booty!
Strip slut!
--- SHAWNTEL ---
I don't give a fuck no more,
If people think I am a whore,
I just wanna dance,
Oh, I just wanna dance,
Things are going bad for me,
I am feeling sad for me,
So I just wanna dance,
Oh, I just wanna dance,
I'm tired of laughing,
I'm tired of crying,
I'm tired of failing,
And I'm tired of all this trying,
I wanna do some living,
'Cos I've done enough dying,
I just wanna dance,
I just wanna fucking dance!
Oh, dance!
Dance!
--- ENSEMBLE ---
She's tired of laughing,
She's tired of crying,
She's tired of failing,
And she's tired of all this trying,
She wants to do some living,
Cos she's done enough dying,
She just wants to dance,
She just wants to fucking dance!
