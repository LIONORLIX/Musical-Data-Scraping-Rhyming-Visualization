------ Backstage Scene ------
--- JERRY (spoken) ---
What the fuck is that idiot Warm Up Man doing out there?
He's turning my people into a mob! You're right, Steve, he's got to go.
--- WARM UP MAN ---
Hey, Jerry,
What can I say man? Tough crowd!
--- JERRY (spoken) ---
Nice to see you, Jonathan.
--- WARM UP MAN ---
Sorry if I let those assholes get a little too loud,
--- JERRY (spoken) ---
Those assholes are my audience.
--- WARM UP MAN ---
Jerry, don't bullshit me,
You and me both, we know,
They are scum!
Filthy cocksucking scum!
--- JERRY (spoken) ---
And your job is to control those scum and keep them from upstaging my guests.
--- WARM UP MAN ---
Pimps and perverts,
Teenage whores,
People so fat they get stuck in revolving doors!
--- JERRY (spoken) ---
And we get them through those doors and onto a plane to Chicago.
--- JERRY'S INNER VALKYRIE ---
Sluts and faggots,
Gimps eating maggots.
--- JERRY (spoken) ---
We've never had a maggot eating gimp on this show!
--- WARM UP MAN ---
Jerry, you could do anything.
--- JERRY (spoken) ---
What are you talking about?
--- WARM UP MAN ---
You could run for Senate!
Or even president!
--- JERRY (spoken) ---
If I want my dick sucked, I'll call my agent.
--- WARM UP MAN ---
Looks like you're cruising,
Playing it safe.
--- JERRY (spoken) ---
You're way out of line, pal.
--- WARM UP MAN ---
You need a challenge,
And I've got just the thing,
Gonna make you sweat,
When you're in the ring.
--- JERRY (spoken) ---
Jonathan, let's cut this short: you need help. Help and a new job.
--- WARM UP MAN ---
NO! You-
--- JERRY (spoken) ---
So thanks for this little chat. Oh, and good luck in the warm-up industry!
--- WARM UP GUY ---
Ooooooh! Sorry, faggots, if I'm out of line!
Sorry if I'm taking too much of your time!
Mr. Fucking Bigshot, sun shines out his ass!
Take your job and shove it; it's been such a blast!
--- JERRY (spoken) ---
...Well, that's the last we'll see of him.
--- WARM UP GUY ---
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you!
I'm so lonely...
--- JERRY (spoken) ---
That went well.
--- JERRY (spoken, to audience) ---
You know, when I was a younger man, I was passionate about civil rights, education, the anti-war movement. I was even elected to the City Council. Then one day, I, uh- I went to a prostitute, and I payed her with a check.
--- Unknown ---
Next day, it was all over, but I faced up to it. And later, i was elected mayor of Cincinnati. Now that's the third largest city- ah, in Ohio. There's only 2 thigns you need to know about politics.
1: You'll never get anywhere if you don't speak up for what you know to be the truth.
And 2: some things should always be paid for in cash.
