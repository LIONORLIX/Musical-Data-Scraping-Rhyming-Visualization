------ This Is My Jerry Springer Moment ------
--- JERRY (spoken) ---
Please welcome Baby Jane.
--- BABY JANE ---
This is my Jerry Springer moment,
I don't want this moment to die,
So dip me in chocolate and throw me to the lesbians,
I don't want this moment to die.
--- ENSEMBLE ---
This is her Jerry Springer moment,
She don't want this moment to die,
So dip her in chocolate and throw her to the lesbians,
To the lesbians,
She don't want this moment to die.
