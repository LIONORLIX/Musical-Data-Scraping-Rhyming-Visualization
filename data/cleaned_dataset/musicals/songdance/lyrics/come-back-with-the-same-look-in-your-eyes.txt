------ Come Back With The Same Look In Your Eyes ------
--- Unknown ---
I will see you in a week or two
it's late, you better get going.
Take care of yourself and
call any time you feel that you're missing me.
I can only say what I always say at these goodbyes.
Come back with the same look in your eyes.
--- Unknown ---
I know you've got your work to do,
and I know how much you love me,
but sometimes a friendly face
can look good to you on a lonely night.
If there comes a time just remember I'm the kind that cries.
Come back with the same look in your eyes.
--- Unknown ---
Everything we want we find in each other.
We would be fools to let love slip away.
Everything's so right I'm scared
that we might loose it one day.
We could never keep things from one another,
you know all the feelings that are in my heart.
It's not easy, it's not easy when you have to be apart.
--- Unknown ---
So I'll see you in a week or two.
Go on, you better get going.
You'd think that by now we'd know how to handle this
but we never will.
When you are away ev'ry day I pray that nothing dies,
and you'll come back with the same look in your eyes.

Won't you come back with the same look in your eyes.
