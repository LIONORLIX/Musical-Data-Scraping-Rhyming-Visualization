------ Capped Teeth And Caesar Salad ------
--- Unknown ---
Capped teeth and Caesar salad,
good old Beverly Hills,
with every deal that's done
an award is won.
You can rent a car
or rent a star.
--- Unknown ---
Suntans and Sunday brunches.
Sprinklers sprinkle away.
It's like a fairy tale,
long as you don't inhale.
I'll call you back and have a nice day.

Capped teeth and Caesar salad.
Spotless Beverly Hills.
If someone takes a walk
all the neighbors talk.
Ev'ry man and beast
came from out east.
--- Unknown ---
Earthquakes and English muffins.
Ulcers poppin' away.
The films are being hyped
before the scripts are typed.
I'll call you back and have a nice day.
Hello...Mr. Bloom's office.
No, I am afraid Mr. Bloom's at a screening.
If you would like to leave word,
We'll get right back to you.
Thank you for calling
Have a nice day.
You have a nice day, too...and a nice swim!

Capped teeth and Caesar salad.
Cozy Beverly Hills.
Out here a woman shops
until her chauffeur drops.
When her bosoms droop
fifty surgeons swoop.
--- Unknown ---
Don't work - sit and look pretty.
Keep you boredom at bay.
Out here the rainbow ends
in your Mercedes Benz.
I'll call you back and have a nice day.

(to herself)  Hello, Mr. Bloom's office. Who is this?
Oh, Emma! Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Bloom's not in to you, Emma.
Never, never, never to Emma, Emma, Emma.
Yes I know, I'm just one of Mr. Bloom's possessions,
one of his things. An object DART, that's what I am.
Just a soggy crumpet floating around the pool all day long.

I'll call you back and have a nice day.
