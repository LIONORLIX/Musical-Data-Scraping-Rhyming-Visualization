------ I Love New York: So Much To Do In New York ------
--- Unknown ---
I love New York. I love New York.
I love the heat. I love the cars,
the Haagen Dazs, the Sunday Times,
the phones that work, the single bars,
the t.v. shows that play all night.
I love the smells, I love the height,
I love the banks, I love the crowds.
Oh! New York, I've never been so lonely.
Loneliness must be the worst feeling of all.

What does it take till you feel you belong here,
till this place shines on your face?
Viv says new men make her feel she belongs here,
and she's right, met one last night.

Paul is the kind of man you might say has it all,
including a wife and four kids up in West Port.
But married or not, somehow his eyes kept wand'ring towards me.
We'll, we'll see.

What can you do in New York with a green card?
What a sight! God bless you Dwight.
No telling what I can do with a green card.
Watch my speed. Work's what I need.
Joe may not leave such a void after all,
with my career, no commitments and Paul.
