------ Take That Look Off Your Face (Reprise) ------
--- Unknown ---
Well, I'm always glad to see you, Viv.
You must be mistaken, it couldn't have been
you couldn't have seen him yesterday.
He's doing some deal down in Baltimore now,
I hate it when he's away.
--- Unknown ---
You must be mistaken, I'm sure that you are.
There's more than one car with stickers on
and lots of young guys wear corduroy shirts,
and I'd know if he hadn't gone.

Take that look off your face.
I can see through your smile.
You would love to be right.
I bet you didn't sleep good last night,
couldn't wait to bring all of that bad news to my door.
Well, I've got news for you: I knew before.
--- Unknown ---
If I'm not mistaken, I know when it came,
in fact I can name the very day.
When we started to plan the future and all,
Joe started to pull away.
No, I didn't dig deep.
I did not want to know.
Well, you don't interfere
when you're scared of the things you might hear.
Bet you think I should end this right now as you would do.
Well, my hard bitten friend, I am not you.

Take that look off your face!
I can see through your smile.
You would love to be right.
I bet you didn't sleep good last night,
couldn't wait to bring all of that bad news to my door.

--- All the signs are showing up now ---
nervous laugh and furtive glance.
He has left, but can't admit it.
Now it starts, the song and...
