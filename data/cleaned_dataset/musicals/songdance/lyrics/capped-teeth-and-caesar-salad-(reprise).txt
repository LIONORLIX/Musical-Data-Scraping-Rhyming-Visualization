------ Capped Teeth And Caesar Salad (Reprise) ------
--- Unknown ---
Capped teeth and Caesar salad.
Blood clot Beverly Hills.
When business starts to dip
wheel out the glucose strip.
Have a cutthroat time
with a twist of lime.
--- Unknown ---
Dreamers trapped in a jewel box.
Big names fading away.
It?s like a wonderland
except the laughter?s canned.
I?ll call you back and,
have a nice day.
