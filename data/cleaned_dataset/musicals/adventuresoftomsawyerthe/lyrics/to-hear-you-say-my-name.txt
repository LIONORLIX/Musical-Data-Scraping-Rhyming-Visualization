------ To Hear You Say My Name ------
--- Unknown ---
I Choose You and You Choose Me
--- Unknown ---
(chorus)
--- Unknown ---
I choose you and you choose me
--- Unknown ---
that's the way it has to be
--- Unknown ---
it's as simple as ABC
--- Unknown ---
when I choose you and you choose me
--- Unknown ---
Everybody has to make a choice
--- Unknown ---
it can be the hardest thing to do
--- Unknown ---
but it was a very natural thing
--- Unknown ---
when it came to choosing you
--- Unknown ---
(chorus)
--- Unknown ---
I have never done this kind of thing
--- Unknown ---
it is so mysterious and new
--- Unknown ---
but it was a very natural thing when it came to choosing you
