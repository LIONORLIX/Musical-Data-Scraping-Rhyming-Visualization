Many people still do not know how to read

Is an inspiration for us all

Hi
We’re the authors of this musical
I wrote the book
--- BUD, spoken ---
And I wrote the music
[BOTH, spoken]
And we both wrote the lyrics
--- DOUG, spoken ---
We wrote ourselves into the finale of the show
Because, like Gutenberg
We have dreams too
--- BUD, spoken ---
And while the printing press may not have solved
All the world’s problems...
--- DOUG, spoken ---
The Holocaust happened!
--- BUD, spoken ---
...we hope the story of the printing press
Did impress upon all of you
The power of our dreams
--- DOUG ---
Life can be cruel and kinda cold
--- BUD ---
And often, no one’s there
To hold you when you cry
[DOUG]
So those who hope must close their eyes
--- BUD ---
And trust a better future lies-
--- BOTH ---
-in dreams
--- Unknown ---
Where our little lives are rounded
With a sleep
And while the emptiness within us
May be deep
We’ll get our fill
While hopeless millions hunger still
--- Unknown ---
We eat dreams
