------ (Might as Well) Go to Hell ------
--- DOUG, spoken ---
Scene three
The monks’ evil tower
It is dark... and dank
--- BUD, spoken ---
The floor is covered with rats... and?with?feces
Helvetica stands at?the window
Overlooking the moon
--- DOUG (as Helvetica) ---
I’m in a?tower with rats and some feces
And the man I adore?is?so?close...
And yet so?far
If I were?here
I would ask him to squeeze these
My heart is one big scar
I’m blubberin’ like a retarded lady
And maybe I oughta be...
Maybe I oughta be beaten
History’s paved with the hearts of the stupid
Heaven is saved for the souls who have no sin
I thought I was brave when I said “hey” to Cupid
But I won’t do that again
Cause now I’ll never have a friend or lover
So maybe I oughta go...
Maybe I might as well go to hell
--- Unknown ---
Might as well
Might as well go to hell
Might as well
Might as well go to hell
--- Unknown ---
My mama told me that hell was a bad place
With no pretty kitties
To cuddle when you’re low
When I am dead
I will sure miss your cat face
But I goofed up and I know
I will never leave Medieval death row
So maybe I oughta go
Maybe I might as well go to hell
--- Unknown ---
Might as well
Might as well go to hell
--- Unknown ---
(spoken)
--- Unknown ---
Rats, sing with me!
--- BUD (as Rats) ---
Might as well
Might as well go to hell
[BOTH (as Helvetica and Rats)]
Might as well
Might as well go to hell
--- DOUG (as Helvetica), spoken ---
I want to die
But should I try?
To kill myself
I dunno!
--- Unknown ---
(singing)
--- Unknown ---
To be or not to be... me
--- Unknown ---
(spoken)
--- Unknown ---
I’ve gotta do it!
--- BUD, spoken ---
Helvetica bends the bars
Steps onto the ledge
And prepares to jump
--- DOUG (as Helvetica), spoken ---
I’m flying!
[BUD, spoken]
Helvetica soars over the town of Schlimmer
--- DOUG (as Helvetica), spoken ---
Goodbye rats!
Goodbye feces!
Hello Schlimmer!
Weeeeee!
It’s beautiful!
I can see my house...
And it’s not real
I’m still in my tower
--- Unknown ---
(singing)
--- Unknown ---
I have betrayed you, my beautiful Hamlet
And when I say Hamlet
I’m talkin’ ‘bout my town
Cause there are two meanings of the word Hamlet
So maybe I oughta drown
Or put my body in the ground
Cause I let everybody down
I’m just a cryin’ clown
Wearing a painted frown
I hear a scary sound
It’s a three headed hound!
Downed with a round brown crown
In hand!
--- BUD (as Rats) ---
Might as well
--- BOTH (as Helvetica and Rats) ---
Might as well go to hell
Might as well
--- DOUG as Helvetica (BUD as Rats) ---
Come and get me Satin!
I wanna be with you!
I want your horns inside me!
I wanna live with you!
In hell!
