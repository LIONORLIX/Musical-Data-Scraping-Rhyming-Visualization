Last night, I invented the printing press
And now I wanna print the Bible with it
I’m gonna call it The Gutenberg Bible
--- BUD (as Monk), whispering ---
Aah, a Bible that will be printed
And distributed to the masses
He must not know the printing press has been destroyed
I shall toy with him
--- Unknown ---
(spoken)
--- Unknown ---
Tell me, Mr. Johan Gutenberg!
Ya ever through about becoming a monk?!
--- DOUG (as Johan Gutenberg), spoken ---

Seemed boring
--- BUD (as Monk), spoken ---
No, Johan Gutenberg!
Monking is powa!

(singing)
--- Unknown ---
Monk with me!
Come live here
I think you’ll like it
I’ve got a cat!
Plus there’s food
Delicious loaves and fishes
--- Unknown ---
(spoken)
--- Unknown ---
Here, taste that!
--- DOUG (as Johan Gutenberg) ---
I don’t know if I can stay and dine
Somehow, it don’t feel right
[BUD (as Monk)]
Monk with me!
Try this on
It’s a monk robe
--- Unknown ---
(spoken)
--- Unknown ---
Don’t that feel nice?
--- DOUG (as Johan Gutenberg), spoken ---
Monk...
--- BUD (as Monk) ---
It’s real silk
From China
There’s nothin’ finer
It’s worth the price
--- DOUG (as Johan Gutenberg), spoken ---
I want it!
--- BUD (as Monk) ---
Then monk... with me
My friend
Yeah!
We’re monkin’ for God now!
Monk... with me
My friend
[DOUG (as Johan Gutenberg)]
My brain is torn
My heart’s confused
I wonder if I’m being used
I only want the world to read!
Can I still do that and monk?
--- BUD (as Monk) ---
It’s better if the world can’t read
God is what the people need
I’m saying that God could be... we!
Oh Gutenberg... monk... with...
--- DOUG (as Johan Gutenberg), spoken ---
NOOOOO!
Oh Monk, don’t you see?!
We’re different!
You believe in God!
I believe... in stuff!
God and stuff don’t mix!
They’re like bugs and beautiful skin
Plus, let’s face it...
You are a terrible monk
--- BUD (as Monk), spoken ---
Choose your words very carefully, Johan Gutenberg!
--- DOUG (as Johan Gutenberg), spoken ---
Words? Yes, I almost forgot!
--- BUD (as Monk), spoken ---
What?
--- DOUG (as Johan Gutenberg), spoken ---
Words!
Yes, like the words in this Bible!
--- BUD (as Monk), spoken ---
No!
--- DOUG (as Johan Gutenberg), spoken ---
Words are why I came here!
--- Unknown ---
(singing)
--- Unknown ---
I believe in my words
I believe in my press
I believe in a reading Germany
Now you want me to monk
As throw that away
I think it’s time to go
--- BUD (as Monk) ---
Do not tell me...
--- DOUG as Johan Gutenberg (BUD as Monk) ---
My answer now is no
--- BUD (as Monk), spoken ---
Door’s locked!
--- DOUG (as Johan Gutenberg), spoken ---
What?!
--- BUD (as Monk), spoken ---
Window’s closed!
--- DOUG (as Johan Gutenberg), spoken ---
How?!
--- BUD (as Monk), spoken ---
You’re not going anywhere
Johan Gutenberg!
--- DOUG (as Johan Gutenberg), spoken ---
Yes I am!
And I’m taking this huge Bible with me!
Oh! It feels like...
Goodness!
The only thing better than this feeling...
Would he mass producing this feeling
--- BUD (as Monk), spoken ---
Gimme that Bible!
--- DOUG (as Johan Gutenberg), spoken ---
How?!
--- BUD (as Monk), spoken ---
You better get your mind off of words
Johan Gutenberg
Why, don’t you want to go to heaven?
--- DOUG (as Johan Gutenberg), spoken ---
Heaven?
--- BUD (as Monk), spoken ---
Yes, heaven!
Why? Where do you think people go when they die?!
--- DOUG (as Johan Gutenberg), spoken ---
Oh, I dunno
I guess I think most people turn into dirt
But some people... turn into statues!
--- BUD (as Monk), spoken ---
Statues?
--- DOUG (as Johan Gutenberg), spoken ---
Yes!
I want my statue to be me
Riding on a dragon
Nursing a baby!
--- BUD (as Monk), spoken ---
Johan Gutenberg
There are no statues in heaven!
--- DOUG (as Johan Gutenberg), spoken ---
Then I don’t wanna go there!
--- BUD (as Monk) ---
Oh, Gutenberg is such a mess
Your life is caught up in that press
You’ll never come to holiness
Unless... you...
--- Unknown ---
Monk... with me
My friend
Yes! We can change heaven!
Monk...
--- DOUG as Johan Gutenberg (BUD as Monk) ---
I’ve got to get out
These windows are locked
And that dark passageway is long
Now I’ve got an idea
I’ll smash through the door!
Yes!
This is my goodbye!
--- BUD (as Monk) ---
You will rue too soon that you
Refused to choose to monk...
With...
