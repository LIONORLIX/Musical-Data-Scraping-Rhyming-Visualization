Dangle dangle dangle

Young Monk!
Why are you crying?!
--- DOUG (as Young Monk), spoken ---
Monk is an?abuser!
--- BUD (as Boot Plaque), spoken ---
Then?why do you?stay with him?
--- DOUG (as Young Monk), spoken ---
I think I can?change him
--- BUD (as Boot Plaque), spoken ---
Young Monk, we boot plaques have a saying:
If you’re in a bad situation...
Get out of it
--- DOUG (as Young Monk), spoken ---
Thanks, boot plaque
But I can’t help but see a bit of good in him
He’s like a tiny seedling...
That just needs the water...
Of me...
And that with a little bit of luck...
That me water...
Will help him grow...
