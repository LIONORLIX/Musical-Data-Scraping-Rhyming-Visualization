--- DOUG, spoken ---
Okay! Here we go!
--- BUD, spoken ---
Again!
--- DOUG, spoken ---
Yes! Here we go again!
--- BUD, spoken ---
The second act!
--- DOUG, spoken ---
Now, you must be sitting there,?thinking?to yourself
“I love?this show more than any show?I’ve seen ever...
But who are these guys onstage?!”
--- BUD, spoken ---
Yeah! Who are we?!
--- DOUG, spoken ---
So we thought we’d take a second
To tell you a little bit... about us
Take it, Bud!
--- BUD, spoken ---
Now, my name is Mr. Bud Davenport
That you already know
But what you may not know...
I’m thirty-three, I’m single
And I love to make music
--- DOUG, spoken ---
Watch out ladies!
--- BUD, spoken ---
Yeah, yeah, yes
I am looking for a wife
Uh... other than Doug
--- DOUG, spoken ---
Sometimes we act just like and old married couple
--- BUD, spoken ---
Gah, you’re... so passive aggressive!
--- DOUG, spoken ---
Well, you... take me for granted sometimes
--- BUD, spoken ---
I’m not gay
--- DOUG, spoken ---
No...
But I am
My name is Doug Simon
I’m thirty four years old
I live in a studio apartment
Above an incredibly loud pet store
And I used to own a cat
[BUD, spoken]
Until it died
--- DOUG, spoken ---
Yes
So!
