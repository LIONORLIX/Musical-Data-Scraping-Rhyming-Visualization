Ya can’t drink words!

I’m gonna get drunk off of words
I’m gonna come home late
I’m gonna stink of words
--- BOTH (as Johan Gutenberg and Drunk #2) ---
Wine is awfully fine
But really, wine is just a word
Words, words, words

Off of words!
--- DOUG (as Drunk #1), spoken ---
That sounds stupid!
--- BUD (as Drunk #2), spoken ---
It’s not!
Words make ya feel all tingly inside!
--- DOUG (as Drunk #1), spoken ---
But that’s what alcohol does!
--- BUD (as Drunk #2), spoken ---
Yes, but words do it without that cripplin’ chemical addiction!
--- DOUG (as Drunk #1), spoken ---
That’s the part I don’t like!
--- BUD (as Drunk #2) ---
Well then pull up a seat
--- DOUG (as Drunk #1) ---
This is a treat
--- BOTH (as Drunk #1 and Drunk #2) ---
Guess we should repeat

Words, words, words

Hey!
--- BUD (as Helvetica) ---
Can I get a second chance?
--- DOUG (as Johan Gutenberg), spoken ---
I dunno what you’re talkin’ about
--- BUD (as Helvetica) ---
I’ve done something really awful!

Come on Helvetica
Let’s dance!

Gutenberg holds Helvetica close
--- Unknown ---
(as Helvetica)

Hello
I... I don’t understand
--- DOUG (as Johan Gutenberg), spoken ---
Wine can make you do... crazy things
You’re fired!
--- BUD (as Helvetica), spoken ---
What?
--- DOUG (as Johan Gutenberg), spoken ---
I’m firing you as my grape stomper
But I wanna hire you... as my wife!

Where are you going?
Where are you going?!
--- BUD, spoken ---
Dance break!
--- DOUG, spoken ---
The entire cast rushes onstage
And Gutenberg is sucked into the madness
--- BUD, spoken ---
Some do wild leaps in the air!
--- DOUG, spoken ---
Some do flips!
--- BUD, spoken ---
Some do somersaults!
--- DOUG, spoken ---
Some do handstands!
--- BUD, spoken ---
Some chicken fight in the corner!
--- DOUG, spoken ---
While the old black narrator soars above it all!
The entire cast joins hands
To form a chorus line!
--- BOTH (as All) ---
We’re gonna get drunk off of words
Someone else should drive
Because we’re drunk off words
Wine is awfully fine
But really, wine is just a word
Words!
Words!
