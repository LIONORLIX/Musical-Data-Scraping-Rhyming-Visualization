------ OK! Here We Go! ------
--- DOUG, spoken ---
OK, here we go!
--- BUD, spoken ---
Whoo! This is exciting!
--- DOUG, spoken ---
Welcome to Gutenberg!
--- BUD, spoken ---
Gutenberg... The Musical!
--- DOUG, spoken ---
I’m Mr. Doug Simon
--- BUD, spoken ---
I’m Mr.?Bud?Davenport
--- DOUG, spoken ---
We’ve written an?exciting new show, and tonight, we?want to present it for the very first time!
--- BUD, spoken ---
But hopefully not for the last time!
--- DOUG, spoken ---
No;
With any luck, we’re hoping to take our show... to Broadway!
--- BUD, spoken ---
And as many of you already know, there are, in the audience tonight, some very big Broadway producers!
So... tell them to produce our show!
--- DOUG, spoken ---
Now-
--- BUD, spoken ---
Yes
--- DOUG, spoken ---
-writing a musical is not easy
--- BUD, spoken ---
Hats off to you Elton John!
--- DOUG, spoken ---
But we did it!
I wrote what we call the book of the musical
--- BUD, spoken ---
And I wrote the music
And the lyrics... well...
--- BOTH, spoken ---
We wrote those together!
[DOUG, spoken]
So you’re probably sitting there and thinking to yourself
“Okay, so you wrote a musical...
But what is it about?”
--- BUD, spoken ---
I dunno Doug
Why don’t you tell us?
--- DOUG, spoken ---
Alright, I will! It’s about Johan Gutenberg!
--- BUD, spoken ---
Who’s he?
--- DOUG, spoken ---
Well, he’s the guy who invented the printing press
--- BUD, spoken ---
And then printed up a bunch of copies of The Bible
--- DOUG, spoken ---
Now, what you’re gonna see tonight is what we call a “reading” of a musical
That means there’s no set, no costumes, only a few props, and no cast!
--- BUD, spoken ---
It’s just me and Doug
[DOUG, spoken]
Right!
Now, before we get started, we do want to take a second
To talk about something pretty serious
And that’s the Holocaust
Every important musical has to tackle at least one very serious issue
--- BUD, spoken ---
Like racism
--- DOUG, spoken ---
Or Vietnam
--- BUD, spoken ---
Or a man with half a face
--- DOUG, spoken ---
Yes
Our show is set in Germany
So our serious issue is the Holocaust
--- BUD, spoken ---
Germans hate Jews!
--- DOUG, spoken ---
Well... not all of them...
Most of them!
--- BUD, spoken ---
Maybe not anymore...
But they used to!
--- DOUG, spoken ---
That hatred... is in this show
--- BUD, spoken ---
It has to be!
--- DOUG, spoken ---
Because it makes our show... important
And now...
--- BOTH, spoken ---
