Central Park.
Jungleland.
Hidden treasures
For greedy fishes.

Down into the boathouse.
Right asides the pond.
Over by the statue
Coupla steps beyond...

Then I cracked him on the head.
And with an electrical cord I keep with me for special occasions,
I tied him up.
Then I went back to the wifey.
Told her there'd been an accident,
she was needed--
