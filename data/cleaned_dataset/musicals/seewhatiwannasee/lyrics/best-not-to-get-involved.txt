The Janitor: (spoken)
I told ya, the guy was dead.
And I did exactly what you're supposed to do in situations like this:
I went home.

(sung)
One thing leads to another
Then another
And then another
One thing leads to another.
Best not to get involved.

In this town
Someguy's always got a brother
Who's a brother
Who's got a brother
Who'd easily shoot his own mother
Best not to get involved.

You never know
When you bump into a stiff
Whose stiff it is
And how it got there.
Mysteries all got an undertow.
And when you go
Snoopin' round the facts
The facts may turn out
To be stranger
Than the mystery you wasn't s'pose to know.
Don't stop.
Don't touch.
Don't ask.
Go home, go home, go home ---
--- Unknown ---
In this town
One thing leads to another
Then another
And then another.
Livin' here you gotta smother
Your curiosity--
Wait untill the mystery's solved.
Best not to get, best not to get,
