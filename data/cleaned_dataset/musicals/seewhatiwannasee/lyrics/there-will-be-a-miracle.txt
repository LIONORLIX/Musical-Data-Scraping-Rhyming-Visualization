------ There Will Be a Miracle ------
--- Unknown ---
Aunt Monica: (sung)
There will be a miracle.
Stick around and see.
You need patience for a miracle.
Timing is the key.
Could not have happened yesterday.
And tomorrow is to late.
The moment has to be exact
And until then we have to wait.
--- Unknown ---
You can never rush a miracle.
You can't force a thing to be.
I am desperate for a miracle;
But it won't come just for me.
--- Unknown ---
We will all share the miracle.
As everybody should:
Little ones.
Grocery clerks.
CPAs
Movie stars.
Battered wives, dying boys.
Hungry souls,
The worst of men
Along with the good.
I always knew there would be a miracle;
I've wondered when and how.
And I will see a miracle.
There will be a miracle.
If not soon;
Now...
--- Unknown ---
There will be a miracle.
We will see a miracle...
Wake me for the miracle...
