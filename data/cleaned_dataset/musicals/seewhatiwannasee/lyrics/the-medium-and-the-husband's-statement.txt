The Janitor: (spoken)
I'm not a psychic so how do I know what she was thinking when she, when he...?
They say only the dead tell the truth, you know.

The Medium: (sung)
What would you like me to say?
It's my work
Talking with the dead.
Flat rate.
Twenty bucks.
So there I was: I'm holding a seance.
For a lawyer.
Who is desp'rate.
Wants to speak with a loved one:
His sister Alice Sue...
Alice Mae.

(spoken)
I was trying to contact said deceased relative when this other spirit breaks in, I almost whooped my pants.
I've heard about this happening to other mediums, psychic interruptions, but never to me.
--- Unknown ---
(sung)
So this spirit, he's got a story
It's a doozy,
And he tells me
No one else knows his story.
Thought I should get involved.
--- Unknown ---
(spoken)
He came from the other side.
This man.
The husband.
And so...
Restless....

The Medium/The Husband: (sung)
Dark...
It's dark here...
Space...
No stars...
No where...
I remember...
My life...
