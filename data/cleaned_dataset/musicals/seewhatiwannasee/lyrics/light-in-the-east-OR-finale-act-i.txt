Light in the east
Got a new day
If you listen you can hear it
Miles and Miles away:
Tghe low, low rumble
Of the town wakin' up
With the light in the east
Night in the west.
There's the moon all pale and tired
Like she needs a little rest
'Cause the night's been busy
You can hear it echo:
Bouncin' offa buildings like a ghost.
Yeah, the night's been busy
Tearin' up the city
Like a too-drunk guest
Who steals from his host
And leaves behind
Bleary eyes,
The smell of sex,
And whiskey lies...
Then comes the light in the east
Time I like best.
It's better when the day
Still has it's youth.
Better to walk.
Better to breathe.
Better to see the truth.

And that was all that he said
I'm just repeating his words
You ever talk to the dead?
I only told you the truth.

His wife.
His words.

It happened just as I said.
What good is lying to you?
I'll get the chair anyway.
I only told you the truth.
