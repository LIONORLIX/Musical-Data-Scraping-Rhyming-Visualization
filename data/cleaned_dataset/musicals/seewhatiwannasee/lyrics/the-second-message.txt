The Priest: (sung)
How bold and blatant lie
Which genius has conceived.
The more far-fetched the lie,
The more that it's believed.
--- Unknown ---
Tens by tens
They gather.
Suckers in the park.
Dozens by the dozens mass
As Gloryday looms
And the lie
Blooms!

The Priest/The Actress: (sung)
In two weeks (In two weeks)
On Tuesday (On Tuesday)
At one P.M. sharp (At one P.M. sharp)
A miracle will occur (A miracle will occur)
--- Unknown ---
Witness to the faith
You'll find salvation here;
From the depths of the pond
Christ will appear!
Believe!
And be free!
