No more trying not to laugh
As you struggle
To squeeze into your trousers
As you slowly go bald.

No more listening to Danny Kaye albums
Or leaping to your voice
Or jumping when called.
--- Unknown ---
No more sleeping through
Your boring foreign movies.
What was it the last time?
Something Japanese.

No more sitting still
While you and your lawyers
Drone on and on
About taxi cab fees.
--- Unknown ---
No more visiting you mother every Sunday.
Choking down her pasta.
Which she always over salts.
--- Unknown ---
No more three A.M. jealous innuendos
Then begging my forgiveness
And then pointing out my faults.
--- Unknown ---
No more.
No more.
Don't look at me that way.
Your ears and your eyes
Got used to the lies
But you're getting the truth today.
--- Unknown ---
No more forcing me
To wear the crap you buy me.
Has anbody told you
You have rotten taste in clothes?
--- Unknown ---
No more forcing me to do
And not to question.
Why I took it this long,
Christ only knows.
--- Unknown ---
No more forcing me
To give up what I wanted.
Sure, I liked your money
But you never bought my soul.
--- Unknown ---
No more forcing me
To put up with your patronizing
Hot-stick, King-Kong
Need to control.
--- Unknown ---
No more forcing me
To act like enjoy it
When you suddenly remember
That I'm sharing your bed.
--- Unknown ---
No more forcing me
To lie and say I'm sorry.
You wanna blame me, baby
Well then, you go right ahead.
--- Unknown ---
No more.
No more.
Don't look at me that way.
You're not alive.
We're not alive.
You and I died today.
No, no more.
No more.
No more!
