Waitin' for the taken'.
Big money.
It's your lucky day.
Your money.
Up to us to grab it.

You know you need money
To keep your baby happy.
Cold money.
To keep her in the ice.
Well there's big money.
Just hold out your mitten,
Bring along the kitten
And don't twice.

There's gravy pourin' out of the red, white and blue-chip
