She went with him. Oh she was afraid, my wife, my Lily, but she...Went with him. Like as though she had always wanted to. I tried to think about something else, rain my mind on something other than their...lovemaking. I thought about the movie that I'd seen that night: Rashomon. Rashomon. Such a beautiful film. The marquee outside the theatre was missing an a from the title, so it spelled R shomon. Where had the a on the marquee gone? Gone...
A for anger.
Ambition.
