------ You'll Go Away With Me ------
--- Unknown ---
The Theif: (sung)
You'll go away with me.
You know you will.
You'll go away with me
And not look back.
--- Unknown ---
Does the sun really rise in the east?
Does the earth really spin around the sun?
What's it matter in the least?
What's real for me ain't real for everyone.
--- Unknown ---
You wanna stay with me.
You know you do.
You know the truth
Is tearin' up your heart.
--- Unknown ---
You knew what you needed.
You knew what you wanted to find.
You'll go away with me
