The Reporter: (spoken)
As you can see, Carol, there is a crowd gathered here at the pond.
By all accounts, it's a peaceful gathering, though police can be seen patrolling the area.
One can't call this a demonstration...

The Priest: (sung)
You've got your crazies
For Jesus' sake.
The losers who've got Nothing to lose.
You've got your herds
Of broken souls,
Emotionally drained black holes;
You've got 'em all here:
Waiting for the Gloryday.
--- Unknown ---
You've got your crippled
And blind and deaf;
A selection of afflictions
To choose.

You've got your shreds
Of desperate lives;
Your criminals and battered wives
All gathering here:
Waiting for the Gloryday.

Bye, bye Lourdes.

Are coming in hordes.

And form a line
