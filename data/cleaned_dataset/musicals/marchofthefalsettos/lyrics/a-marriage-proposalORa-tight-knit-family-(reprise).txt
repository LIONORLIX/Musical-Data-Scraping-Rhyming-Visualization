------ A Marriage Proposal/A Tight-Knit Family (Reprise) ------
--- Unknown ---
(Jason) (speaking)
This is how you make a marriage proposal.
--- Unknown ---
(Mendel) (singing)
I love you dear.
I think you?re swell.
You?re never near me close enough to tell
If I?m delightful or not.
--- Unknown ---
I need your wrist.
I praise your thigh.
There?s not a guy,
There?s not a piece of paper,
There?s not a man in pants
Who could love you the same as I!
--- Unknown ---
Oftentimes, lovers are crazy people.
Sometimes they kill each other.
Just like a biblical brother
Did to his biblical brother
Back in biblical times.
--- Unknown ---
(Trina)
Biblical times?
--- Unknown ---
(Marvin) (speaking)
Biblical times?
--- Unknown ---
(Mendel)
Uh, biblical times.
(singing) Oh, those? biblical times!
--- Unknown ---
I love your eyes.
I love your face.
I want you by my side to take my place
If I get sick or detained.
--- Unknown ---
Don?t brush your hair, you?re perfect.
Don?t start to cry.
There?s not a guy,
There?s not a horse or zebra,
There?s not a giant man
Who could love you the same as I!
--- Unknown ---
Forget that giant man,
He won?t love you the same as I!
I?m not a giant man,
But I?ll love you until,
Love you until,
I die!
--- Unknown ---
(Marvin)
Well, the situation?s this;
I could use a little drink,
I divorced my wife,
She dried her eyes,
Then she ran off with my shrink.
--- Unknown ---
But I want a tight-knit family.
I want a wife who knows what love is.
Maybe she does, I?m too damn peeved,
Too self-absorbed,
Too self-deceived,
To note.
--- Unknown ---
(Mendel)
I should worry what he says,
Like his words could hurt me worse.
Marvin acts bereft,
My acts of theft
Are incredibly perverse.
--- Unknown ---
(Marvin) (speaking)
You said it.
--- Unknown ---
(Mendel)
It?s embarrassing,
(singing) But I?ll get a nice, tight family,
Son with a brain and nice, bright mother.
Yes, I feel guilt. Yes, I?m annoyed.
So was Jung, so was Freud!
--- Unknown ---
But I, I know you?ll come through it.
If so, you?ll have to be rich.
--- Unknown ---
(Marvin) (overlapping)
But I, I can?t believe she loves you!
Why? I?m sure she cannot love you!
--- Unknown ---
But nothing?s impossible!
--- Unknown ---
(Mendel)
Look who?s got power,
--- Unknown ---
(Marvin)
Ah, King of the Losers!
--- Unknown ---
(Mendel)
At eighty an hour!
He can bitch,
I can stall.
--- Unknown ---
(Marvin)
I want
--- Unknown ---
(Mendel)
I?ve got it all!
--- Unknown ---
(Marvin) (overlapping)
I want it all!
--- Unknown ---
(Both)
Oh, sure, we?re gonna come through it!
No doubt, the bastard prepares!
We?re needy and wanting,
We?re greedy as swine!
--- Unknown ---
(Mendel)
I just want a family.
--- Unknown ---
(Marvin)
Well, the family was mine!
--- Unknown ---
(Both)
But who dares,
Dares to brawl?
I got it all!
I got it all!
