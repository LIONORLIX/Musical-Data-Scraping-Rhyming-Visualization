------ Marvin At The Psychiatrist ------
--- Unknown ---
(Jason)
My father says that love
Is the most beautiful thing in the world.
I think games are,
I think chess is the most
Beautiful thing,
Not love.

(Whizzer) (speaking)
Marvin at the Psychiatrist, a three-part mini opera.
Part One.
--- Unknown ---
(Mendel) (singing)
Do you love him'
--- Unknown ---
(Marvin)
Sorta kinda.
--- Unknown ---
(Mendel)
Do you need him'
--- Unknown ---
(Marvin)
Sorta kinda.
He makes me smile a lot,
Especially at mealtime.
It makes me feel I'm sort of smart.
--- Unknown ---
(Mendel)
Mm-hmm.
Is he special'
--- Unknown ---
(Marvin)
He's delightful.
--- Unknown ---
(Mendel)
And romantic'
--- Unknown ---
(Marvin)
Yes, but spiteful.
And yet it seems that so am I.
--- Unknown ---
(Mendel)
Just enjoy what you can.
Love the boy, not the man.
--- Unknown ---
(Marvin)
Man'
Sorta stylish.
--- Unknown ---
(Mendel)
Kinda very'
--- Unknown ---
(Marvin) (speaking)
Mmm, very very sorta.
--- Unknown ---
(Mendel) (singing)
And kind of hard to describe'
--- Unknown ---
(Marvin) (speaking)
Yes, you know, I think that's true.
--- Unknown ---
(Mendel)
When he's naked,-
--- Unknown ---
(Marvin)
Yes'
--- Unknown ---
(Mendel)
Does he thrill you'
--- Unknown ---
(Marvin)
Yes!
--- Unknown ---
(Mendel)
Is he vicious'
--- Unknown ---
(Marvin)
Yes!
--- Unknown ---
(Mendel)
(thinks) Yes.
I think he's sorta kinda mean.
But I love him, and I need it.
If he loved me, I'd concede it.
--- Unknown ---
(Mendel)
Don't despise what you feel.
Love the friend, not the heel.
--- Unknown ---
(Marvin)
Heel'
--- Unknown ---
(Mendel)
He's sometimes worthless'
--- Unknown ---
(Marvin)
Sometimes evil.
--- Unknown ---
(Mendel)
Sometimes smarmy'
--- Unknown ---
(Whizzer) (speaking)
Part Two.
--- Unknown ---
(Mendel) (singing)
It's queer, Mr. Marvin- sorry.
--- Unknown ---
(Marvin)
Jesus'
--- Unknown ---
(Mendel)
Strange, Mr. Marvin,
How your wife- your ex-wife's meager glories
Coupled with her tragic stories,
Moves me in unreported ways.
--- Unknown ---
(Marvin)
She's a very good woman.
She's a wonderful woman.
--- Unknown ---
(Mendel)
Do you mind that'
She was here to speak of Jason, and I find that
I hope Jason acts out more,
Cause there's a few more things we need explore.
--- Unknown ---
(Marvin) (speaking)
No, I understand.
--- Unknown ---
(Mendel)
Good! Very good. Very, very good!
I feel a lot better already.
Going on'
(singing) Was she a vicious woman'
--- Unknown ---
(Marvin)
No.
--- Unknown ---
(Mendel)
Did she beat the child'
--- Unknown ---
(Marvin)
No!
--- Unknown ---
(Mendel)
Did she ever drive you wild'
--- Unknown ---
(Marvin)
No.
--- Unknown ---
(Mendel)
Never'
--- Unknown ---
(Marvin)
No.
--- Unknown ---
(Mendel)
Never'
--- Unknown ---
(Marvin)
No.
--- Unknown ---
(Mendel)
Never-never-never-never'
--- Unknown ---
(Marvin)
No.
--- Unknown ---
(Mendel)
Never'
--- Unknown ---
(Marvin)
No.
--- Unknown ---
(Mendel)
Never'
--- Unknown ---
(Marvin)
No, no, no!
--- Unknown ---
(Mendel)
Was she faithful'
Be objective.
--- Unknown ---
(Marvin)
Well, yes.
--- Unknown ---
(Mendel)
She was faithful!
--- Unknown ---
(Marvin)
Yes.
--- Unknown ---
(Mendel)
And her last caress was:
--- Unknown ---
(Marvin)
Careless.
--- Unknown ---
(Mendel)
You mean, 'careful'.
--- Unknown ---
(Marvin)
Careful,
Not to show she cared.
--- Unknown ---
(Mendel)
So you weren't prepared
For the crying,
And the screaming.
--- Unknown ---
(Marvin)
And the beating of the breast!
(speaking) I don't want to be rude.
--- Unknown ---
(Mendel) (singing)
Does she sleep in the nude'
--- Unknown ---
(Marvin)
...No.
Going on.
--- Unknown ---
(Mendel)
Did you like that'
Would she change it if she knew you didn't like that'
Did she wear a negligee'
Could you blow and it would blow away'
I don't mean to interfere.
I would like to make that very clear.
--- Unknown ---
(Whizzer) (speaking)
Part Three.
--- Unknown ---
(Marvin) (singing)
My son's distressing.
--- Unknown ---
(Jason)
My father's snide.
--- Unknown ---
(Marvin)
I'm convalescing.
--- Unknown ---
(Jason)
He's morbid and dissatisfied.
--- Unknown ---
(Marvin)
What should I do now'
--- Unknown ---
(Jason)
He loves another.
--- Unknown ---
(Marvin)
I agree.
--- Unknown ---
(Jason)
I love my mother.
--- Unknown ---
(Marvin)
Why not me'
We go to ball games.
--- Unknown ---
(Jason)
The ball is tossed.
--- Unknown ---
(Marvin)
The pitcher's handsome.
--- Unknown ---
(Jason)
And our team lost.
--- Unknown ---
(Marvin)
Is that my problem'
Should I be blamed for that'
--- Unknown ---
(Jason)
Explore museums.
--- Unknown ---
(Marvin)
Admire art.
--- Unknown ---
(Jason)
We stand together.
--- Unknown ---
(Marvin)
But we stand there looking miles apart.
How do I reach him'
What words of wisdom'
What should I do now'
--- Unknown ---
(Jason)
My father says that love
Is the most beautiful thing in the world.
I think games are,
I think chess is the most
Beautiful thing,
Not love.

The End.
