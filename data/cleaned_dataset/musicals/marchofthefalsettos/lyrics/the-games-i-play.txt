------ The Games I Play ------
--- Unknown ---
I don?t look for trouble
I do not accept blame
I?ve a good and a bad side
But they?re one and the same
Ask me to arouse you
I will rise and obey
These are the games I play
--- Unknown ---
I screw every morning
Then bathe and drink tea
I been playing canasta
Disasta-
rously
All my recreation seems to suit me okay
These are the games I play
--- Unknown ---
It?s tough with love
Love?s tough to show
Let me face the music
It?s a song that I was waiting to hear so long
So long ago
--- Unknown ---
I bet on the horses
I die by degree
I am sure his divorce is
A tribute to me
Ask me if I love him
It depends on the day
These are the games I play
--- Unknown ---
It?s tough, my friend
Love?s looking strong
Play again the music
It?s a song that I been waiting to hear
For much to long
Years, years too long
--- Unknown ---
It hurts not to love him
It hurts when love fades
It?s hard when part of him
Is off playing fam?ly charades
--- Unknown ---
Ask me if I need him
Get him out of my way
These are
These are the games
These are the games
These are the only games I play
