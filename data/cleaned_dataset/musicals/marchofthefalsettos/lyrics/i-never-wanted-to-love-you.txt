Let me go, you should know
I'm not ashamed
To have loved you.

God, I'm distressed.
How I love you.

I never wanted to love you.

Condescend, stay my friend.

Not to love you'

I never wanted to love you.
I only wanted to see my face in yours.
Jason smiled, save this child.
How he adores, and hates me-

It really killed me when you took those vows.
Don't misunderstand, I'm in command!
Anyhow, we're through!
I never wanted,

I never, never, never, never,
Never, never wanted to love you!
I never wanted to love you!
I never wanted to love you!
I never wanted to love you!

Love you!
