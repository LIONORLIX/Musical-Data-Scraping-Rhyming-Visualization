------ A Tight-Knit Family ------
--- MARVIN ---
Well, the situation?s this
Its not tough to comprehend
I divorced my wife
I left my child
And I ran off with a friend
--- Unknown ---
But I want a tight-knit family
I want a group that harmonizes
I want my wife and kid and friend
To pretend
Time will mend
Our pain
--- Unknown ---
So I make them interact
So I don?t go by the book
We all eat as one-
Wife, friend, and son-
And I sing out as I cook
--- Unknown ---
?I want a tight-knit family.
I hope you all enjoy linguine.
Talk till you hear the dinner bell.
Such a dear clientele.
--- Unknown ---
I swear we?re gonna come through it.
I fear we?ll probably fight,
But nothing?s impossible.
Live by your wit-?
Kid, wife, and lover will have to admit
I was right
I cushioned the fall
I want it all
I want it all
