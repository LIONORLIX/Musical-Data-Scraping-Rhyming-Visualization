------ Everyone Tells Jason To See A Psychiatrist ------
--- Unknown ---
(Trina)
Darling, please see a psychiatrist.
He doesn't bite, and he might
Help you understand
Why you are so angry and despised
By all those guys
Who have not been, they have not been analyzed.
--- Unknown ---
Yet, sweetheart, please do not get hysterical.
Reason will win the day, trust me!
Mother never lies.
No one is saying you're a sick neurotic,
But you could find some help.
Hear me out, please.
Yes, you could find some help,
He could help you realize

Daddy's sincere, but a schmo!
You and I must trust our emotions,
Make no commotions.
