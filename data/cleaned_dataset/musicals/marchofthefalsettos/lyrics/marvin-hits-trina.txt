You die on May 27th at eight!

He has lost his mind.

Mendel plans to rub my back.
Mendel?s not a maniac.
And he?s sweet,
And he?s warm,
And he loves me so.

(Marvin)
Tell me, Trina, what was the impetus?
Sorry, Trina, look in my eyes.
Really, Trina, this is ridiculous,
Jesus, Trina, how I despise
Your need for stupid conversation!

(Marvin)
You are trying to ruin my sleep!
I?m sure you chose him to make me look bad!
How could you ever deny what we had?
