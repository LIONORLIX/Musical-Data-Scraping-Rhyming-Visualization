------ I'm Breaking Down ------
--- TRINA ---
I?d like to be a princess on a throne
To have a country I can call my own
And a king
Who?s lusty and requires a fling
With a female thing
--- Unknown ---
Great, men will be men
Let me turn on the gas
I saw them in the den with
Marvin grabbing Whizzer?s ass
--- Unknown ---
Oh sure, I?m sure, he?s sure he did his best
I bet he meant to be what he was not
The things he was are things which I forgot
He?s a queen
I?m a queen
Where is our crown?
--- Unknown ---
I?m breaking down
I?m breaking down
My life is shitty
And my kid seems like an idiot to me
I mean that?s sick
I mean he?s great
It?s me who is the matter
Talking madder
Than the maddest hatter
--- Unknown ---
If I repeat one more word
I swear I?ll lose my brain
What else should I explain?
Oh, yes it?s true
I can cry on cue,
But so can you
--- Unknown ---
I?m breaking down
I?m breaking down
Down, down
You ask me if it?s fun to cry over nothing
It is, I?m breaking down
--- Unknown ---
Oh, darn. I don?t have time for a breakdown now;
I have to get back to my banana-carrot surprise. Ouch! Gosh, that hurt.
--- Unknown ---
Now let?s consolidate our simple thoughts
A healthy fruit is healthy ?til it rots
I agree
We sat beneath the apple tree
Marv, his friend, and me
--- Unknown ---
Now, speaking of friends
Whizzer is sweet and trim
I think he sets the trends
I think in fact I?ll marry him
He wants me
--- Unknown ---
I?d like to hate him but I really can?t
It?s like a nightmare how this all proceeds
I hope that Whizzer don?t fulfill his needs
Don?t is wrong
Sing along
What was the noun?
--- Unknown ---
I?m breaking down
I?m breaking down
I?ll soon redecorate these stalls
I want some padding on the wall
And also pills
I wanna sleep
Sure thing?ll prob?lly worsen
But it?s not like I?m a healthy person
--- Unknown ---
I?ve rethought my talks with Marv
And one fact does emerge
I think I like his shrink
So that is why I should turn to drink
I?m on the brink
--- Unknown ---
Of breaking down
I?m breaking down
Down, down
--- Unknown ---
I only want to love a man who can love me
Or like me
Marvin was never mine
He took his meetings in the boy?s latrine
I used to cry
He?d make a scene
I?d rather die
Than dry-clean
Marvin?s wedding gown
--- Unknown ---
I?m breaking down
I?m breaking down
It?s so upsetting how I found
That what?s rectangular is round
I mean it stinks
I mean he?s queer
It?s me who is the freak
Who needs it maybe every other week
--- Unknown ---
I?ve rethought my talks with Marv
And one fact to emerge
I play the foolish clown
The almost virgin
Who sing this dirge
Is on the verge
--- Unknown ---
Of breaking down
I?m breaking down
Down, down
The only thing that?s breaking up is my fam?ly
The only thing that?s breaking up is my fam?ly
But me, I?m breaking down
Down
