------ Love Is Blind ------
--- MENDEL ---
Sit down, my dear
I hear you have a problem
I?m sure you?re not disgusting or indiscreet
Take a load off your feet-
--- TRINA ---
Love is a mess
So?s my son, expressly to hurt me
Marvin, my ex-
You?ve seen him for years-
Told me over the phone to tell you my fears
Do you only treat queers?
--- MENDEL ---
Breathe deep, my dear
You?ll find me understanding
Your pain is a priori
Unfold you untold story
Now to break bread
Loosen your glands
Put your head in my hands
--- TRINA ---
I?m everything he wanted
It?s time I put it all together
The date was set
My father let my marry
I married. I?
Then Marvin came from work
Sat me down on the bed
He told me how he loved me
How needed, that thought valued me
I have?
--- MENDEL ---
What?
--- Unknown ---
MARVIN (as Trina mouths this)
Syphilis
--- TRINA ---
He said
--- MENDEL ---

MARVIN (Trina mouths)
Syphilis

TRINA (to Marvin)
I am probably diseased
--- MENDEL ---
You?re a lovely girl
--- Unknown ---
TRINA (to Marvin)
And so easily appeased
--- MENDEL ---
What a lovely girl, though she?s probably diseased
--- TRINA ---
He took pains to not excited us
He explains I?ve?
--- MARVIN ---
Hepatitis
--- TRINA ---

--- MARVIN, JASON, AND WHIZZER ---
Hepa hepa hepatitis hepatitis hepatitis

Love is blind
Love can tell a million stories
Love?s unkind
Spiteful in a million ways
--- TRINA ---
Then I stayed home from work
Took good care of my men
They faked despair, they wet their bed,
They combed their hair, they acted dead
One said?
--- MENDEL ---
Yes?
--- JASON ---
Daddy is a prick
--- MENDEL ---
What?
--- TRINA ---
He said?
--- MENDEL ---
Yes?
--- JASON ---
Daddy isn?t mine
--- MENDEL ---
Good
--- TRINA ---
He filled my coats
With candies and notes,
With ?Will you be my valentine??
--- Unknown ---
MARVIN (To Whizzer)
Will you be my valentine?
--- TRINA ---
This gets harder to believe
--- MENDEL ---
You?re a damaged girl
--- TRINA ---
I?ve a scalpel up my sleeve
--- ALL ---
What a damaged girl
--- MENDEL ---
Do not ever slit your wrists
--- TRINA ---
I?ve missed him; he?s still missing
Don?t make noise, but daddy?s kissing
Boys
--- ALL ---
Petty, petty, petty, petty
--- MENDEL AND TRINA ---
Love is blind
Love can tell a million stories
Love?s unkind
Spiteful in a million ways

Love is blind

MARVIN/ OTHERS
Love is crazy/ Love-
Love is often boring
Love stinks/ Love-
Love is pretty often debris
When you find/ Love-
What you find
Then never, never, never, never, never/ Love-
Do it over again
--- Unknown ---
Love reads like a bad biography/ Love-
All the names are changed to protect the innocent/ Love-
--- ALL ---
Love is blind
--- MENDEL ---
My name is Mendel
I treat her husband
I think she?s very insecure
But so am I
I?ve never married
Work, work is my passion
Or perhaps that?s an alibi
--- Unknown ---
(speak)
I don?t care to discuss it.
--- Unknown ---
(sing)
I think she?s charming
I think she?s eager
That?s unprofessional and mean
But still it?s true
--- ALL ---
His name is Mendel
--- WHIZZER ---
Ah-ah
--- MENDEL ---
Return next Friday
