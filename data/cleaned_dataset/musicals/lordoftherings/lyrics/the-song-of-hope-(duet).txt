------ The Song Of Hope (Duet) ------
--- Aragorn ---
At the edge of darkness
Hope is whispering still
Tender, honoring, gently stirring
Memories unfurling in the mind
--- Unknown ---
Warm winds from a far forgotten country
Long left behind
Distant and divided
Worlds and miles apart
Dreams of days together
Broken in my heart
--- Unknown ---
Lives we saw before us fade away
Sweet words we will never whisper
Words we long to say
--- Arwen ---
Soft now my love
and rest your hand in mine
Feel my love
Always My love
Forever by your side
Love immortal, love undying
--- Unknown ---
Wandering the empty world
In twilight silver shade
Following the hidden paths
Slow and unafraid
--- Arwen and Aragorn ---
let the sunlight free the heart
Forever bound to roam
--- Arwen ---
And let the waking morning
find the weary traveler
returning home
--- Aragorn ---
At last returning home
--- Aragorn ---
I am yours
let your heart trust in mine
Feel my love I am here
--- Unknown ---
Evermore will our lives be entwined
So take my hand and live or die
--- Arwen ---
Soft now my love
And fold your heart in mine
Feel my love I am here
Always my love our lives will be entwined
So my love I am here
--- Arwen and Aragorn ---
Let fate eternal lead us home
Love undying
--- Aragorn ---
Awaking dawn will find
and at last find us home return
--- Arwen ---
Lead us home
--- Arwen and Aragorn ---
Return!
Return!
--- Arwen ---
My love!
--- Arwen and Aragorn ---
