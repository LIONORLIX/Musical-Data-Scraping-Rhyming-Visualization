------ The Cat And The Moon ------
--- FRODO ---
There's an inn of old renown
Where they brew a beer so brown
Moon came rolling down the hill
One Hevensday night to drink his fill.
--- FRODO/MERRY ---
On a three-stringed fiddle there
Played the Ostler's cat so fair
The horn√©d Cow that night was seen
To dance a jig upon the green.
--- Unknown ---
Called by the fiddle to the
Middle of the muddle where the
Cow with a caper sent the
Small dog squealing.
Moon in a fuddle went to
Huddle by the griddle but he
Slipped in a puddle and the
World went reeling.
--- Unknown ---
Downsides went up- hey!
Outsides went wide.
As the fiddle
Played a twiddle
And the Moon slept till Sterrenday.
Upsides went west- hey!
Broadsides went boom.
With a twiddle on the fiddle
In the middle by the griddle
And the Moon slept till Sterrenday.
--- FRODO ---
Dish from off the dresser pranced,
Found a spoon and gaily danced.
--- PIPPIN ---
Horses neighed and champed their bits
For the bloodshot Moon had lost his wits.
--- MERRY ---
Well, cow jumped over, Dog barked wild,
Moon lay prone and sweetly smiled.
--- SAM ---
Ostler cried, Play faster, Cat!
--- ALL ---
Because we all want to dance like that.
--- FRODO/PIPPIN ---
Gambol and totter till you're
Hotter than a hatter and you
Spin all akimbo
Like a windmill flailing.
Whirl with a clatter till you
Scatter every cotter and the
Strings start a-pinging as the
World goes sailing.
--- ALL HOBBITS ---
Downsides go up- hey!
Outsides go wide.
You can clatter
With your platter
But the Moon slept till Sterrenday.
Upsides go west- hey!
Broadsides go boom.
With a batter and a clatter
You can shatter every platter
But the Moon slept till Sterrenday.
