------ Lothlorien ------
--- LEGOLAS ---
From the west she appeared,
Sunlight and stars in her hair.
In her eyes an undying memory of home,
A land that is magical and fair.
--- Unknown ---
When her feet came to rest,
Deep in a canopied glade,
She lifted her face and there she danced.
The realm of Lothl?rien she made.
--- Unknown ---
Gaze on me lady of gold,
Reawaken my slumbering soul.
Beacon of courage summon me home,
to your haven of wonders untold.

Oh child of my heart,
Born of a never ending dream.
You were cradled in light,
Bathed in an ever flowing stream.
--- Unknown ---
Flourish and grow,
my mystical world.
Here you will ever belong.
Son of my yearning,
Daughter of hope.
Beautiful child of my song.
--- Unknown ---
Although storms may descend,
Mountain and valley may quake.
For the days that remain,
This is the promise I make.
No shadow fall across this land,
Before the wind and fire I stand,
And you my child will know no harm,
Enfolded in my arms,
Lothl?rien!
