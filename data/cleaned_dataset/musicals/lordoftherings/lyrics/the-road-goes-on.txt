------ The Road Goes On ------
--- SAM ---
There's a Road
Calling you to stray.
Step by step
Pulling you away.
--- SAM/FRODO ---
Under Moon and Star
Take the Road
No matter how far.
--- Unknown ---
Where it leads
No-one ever knows
Don't look back
Follow where it goes.
Far beyond the Sun
Take the Road
Wherever it runs.
--- Unknown ---
The Road goes on
Ever ever on
Hill by hill
Mile by mile
Field by field
Stile by stile.
The Road goes on
Ever ever on
--- Unknown ---
The Road goes on
Ever ever on
Hill by hill
Mile by mile
Field by field
Stile by stile.
The Road goes on
Ever ever on
--- RANGERS ---
Mountain and valley
And pasture and meadow
Stretching unending
For mile after mile.
Fenland and moorland
And shoreline and canyon
Bordered by hurdle
And hedgerow and stile
--- PIPPIN ---
One more mile
Then it's time to eat
Pick some pears,
Succulent and sweet.
--- PIPPIN/MERRY ---
To the farthest shore.
Take the Road
A hundred miles more.
--- MERRY ---
Sweet pink trout
Tickled form a stream
Milk a goat,
Churn it into cream.
--- MERRY/PIPPIN ---
Far beyond the Sun
Take the Road
Wherever it runs.
--- Unknown ---
The Road goes on
Ever ever on
Moor by moor
Glen by glen
Vale by vale
Fen by fen
The Road goes on
Ever ever on.
--- FRODO/SAM ---
See the Road flows past your doorstep
Calling for your feet to stray
Like a deep and rolling river
It will sweep them far away.
--- ALL ---
Just beyond the far horizon
Lies a waiting world unknown
Like the dawn its beauty beckons
With a wonder all its own.

Bordered by hurdle
And hedgerow and stile.
