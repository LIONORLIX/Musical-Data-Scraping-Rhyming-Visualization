--- Translation ---
--- Unknown ---
The winds of change blow
and the old world will not remain.
Separate we are vulnerable,
together we may hope to conquer the shadow.
--- Unknown ---
Listen to the voices
on the wind,
the voices of your forefathers.
Do not be afraid!
There is a choice to make
and none can help you.
