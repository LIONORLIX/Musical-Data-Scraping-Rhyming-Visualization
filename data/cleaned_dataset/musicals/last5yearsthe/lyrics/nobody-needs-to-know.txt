------ Nobody Needs to Know ------
--- JAMIE ---
Hey, kid - good morning
You look like an angel
I don't remember when we fell asleep
We should get up, kid
Cathy is waiting...
--- Unknown ---
Look at us, lying here
Dreaming, pretending
I made a promise and I took a vow
I wrote a story
And we changed the ending
Cathy, just look at me now!
--- Unknown ---
Hold on, facts are facts
Just relax, lay low
All right, the panic recedes:
Nobody needs to know
--- Unknown ---
Put on my armor
I'm off to Ohio
Back into battle till
I don't know when
Swearing to her that I
Never was with you
And praying I'll hold you again
--- Unknown ---
Hold on, clip these wings -
Things get out of hand
All right, it's over, it's done
No one will understand
No one will understand...
--- Unknown ---
We build a treehouse
I keep it from shaking
Little more glue every time that it breaks
Perfectly balanced
And then I start making
Conscious, deliberate mistakes
--- Unknown ---
All that I ask for
Is one little corner
One private room
At the back of my heart
Tell her I found one
She sends out battalions
To claim it and blow it apart
--- Unknown ---
I grip and she grips
And faster we're sliding
Sliding and spilling
And what can I do?
Come back to bed, kid
Take me inside you
I promise I won't lie to you
--- Unknown ---
Hold on, don't cry yet
I won't let you go
All right - the panic recedes
All right - everyone bleeds
All right - I get what I need
And nobody needs to know
Nobody needs to know
--- Unknown ---
And since I have to be in love with someone
Since I need to be in love with someone
Maybe I could be in love with someone
