------ I Was Born On The Day Before Yesterday ------
--- Unknown ---
I was born on the day before yesterday
I had holes in my shoes, and I was crying the blues
And I didn't have a place to stay
--- Unknown ---
Somehow I know
I know, i'm gonna make it this time
cause somehow i know
I know i'm gonna make it this time
--- Unknown ---
I was born on a hill not so far away
Out of three rubber bands, old gloves for hands,
And a suit that had been thrown away
They took the jacket and pants
Found a brown paper bag
And they filled it with straw
And to top off the drag
They gave me penciled-in eyes
And a penciled-in nose
And they stuck me up there and said
'Strike me a pose'!!
--- Unknown ---
But somehow i know, i know i'm
Gonna make it this time.
cause somehow i know
I'm gonna make it this time
Listen to me now
Let me sing one
So we all can hear it
Gonna lift my head up
Can you feel my spirit?
Can you feel my spirit?
--- Unknown ---
And now that i know
That i wasn't born yesterday
And that I'm fully grown
I can stand on my own
And nothin's gonna get in my way
--- Unknown ---
Because i'm gonna get mine
I'm gonna turn things around
Gonna get myself together
Gonna get on down
And when i feel that rain come in
Through the bottom of my shoes
I'm gonna leave 'em by the roadside
And quit crying the blues
--- Unknown ---
But somehow I know (i know)
I know i'm gonna make it this time
Yes, somehow i know (i know)
I know i'm gonna make it this time.
--- Unknown ---
Listen to me now
Gonna sing one,
So you all can hear it
Gonna lift my head up
Can you feel my spirit?
