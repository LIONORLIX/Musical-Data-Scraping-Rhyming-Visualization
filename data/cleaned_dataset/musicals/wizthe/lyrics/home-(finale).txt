------ Home (Finale) ------

When I think of Home
I think of place
Where there's love overflowing.
I wish I was home
I wish I was back there
With the thing i've been knowing.
Wind that makes the tall glass
Bend into leaning
Suddenly, the raindrops that fall
Have a meaning
Sprinklin the scene
Makes it all clean
--- Unknown ---
Maybe there's a chance
For me to go back
Now that I have some direction
It sure would be nice
To be back home
Where there's love and affection
And just maybe I
Can convince time to slow up
Giving me enough time
In my life to grow up
Time, be my friend, let me start again.
--- Unknown ---
Suddenly, my world's gone
And changed It's face
But I still know where I'm going
I have had my mind spun around in space And yet, I've watched it growing
And if you're listening god, please, Don't make it hard
To know if we should believe the things That we see
Tell us, should we try to stay,
should we run away, or would it be Better just to let things be?
--- Unknown ---
Living here in this brand new world
Might be a fantasy,
But its taught me to love
So it real, real, real to me
And I've learned
That we must look inside our hearts
To find
A world full of love
Like yours, Like mine
Like Home
