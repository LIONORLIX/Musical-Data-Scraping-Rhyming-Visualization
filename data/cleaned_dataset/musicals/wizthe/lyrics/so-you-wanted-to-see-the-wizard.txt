------ So You Wanted to See the Wizard ------
--- Unknown ---
So you wanted to meet the wizard
Let me tell you that you've come to the right place
Shall i make you a frog or a lizard
You should see the strained expression on your face
If the way i come on is fright'ning
That's the way i felt like coming on today
Have you ever been kissed by lightning
Let me tell you, that will make you go away
I fly
And the magic of my power takes me higher
To a level where the clouds turn into fire
In the warmness of the fire i feel fine
Just keep your eyes open and the magic you will see
It will whistle on the wind as it emanates from me
It's a strong and true vibration
You can feel it on your skin
So come and take my hand and we will dance
Upon the wind
Ahhhhhhh
