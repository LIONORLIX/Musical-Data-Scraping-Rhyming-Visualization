------ Ease on Down the Road 1 ------
--- Unknown ---
Scarecrow and Dorothy
Come on and
Ease on down, ease on down the Road!
Come on, ease on down
Ease on down the road
Don't you carry nothing
That might be a load
Come on, ease on down...ease on down the road!
--- Unknown ---
Pick your left foot up
When your right one's down,
Come on legs keep movin'
Don't you lose no ground
You just keep on keepin'
On the road that you choose;
Don't you give up walkin'
'Cause you gave up shoes...

Ease on down, ease on down the road
Come on, ease on down
Ease on down the road
Don't you carry nothing
That might be a load,
Come on...
Ease on down,
Ease on down the road
Ease...On...Down,
Ease...On...Down,
