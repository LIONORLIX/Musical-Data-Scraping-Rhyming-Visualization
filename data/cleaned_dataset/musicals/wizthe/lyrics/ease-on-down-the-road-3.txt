------ Ease On Down The Road 3 ------
--- Unknown ---
Lion, Scarecrow, Tinman and Dorothy
Oh there maybe times
When you wish you wasn't born.
And you wake one morning
Just to find your courage gone.
But just know that feelin'
Only lasts a little while,
You stick with us
And we'll show you how to smile!
--- Unknown ---
Ease on down, ease on down the Road!
Come on ease on down, ease on down the road!
Ease on down, ease on down the road
Don't you carry nothin'
That might be a load...
Come on, ease on down,
Ease on down the road!
