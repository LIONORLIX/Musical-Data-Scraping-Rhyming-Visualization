------ Slide Some Oil to Me ------
--- Unknown ---
Timan and The Dixieland Band
Slide some oil to me
Let it trickle down my spine
If you don't have S.T.P.
Crisco will do just fine
--- Unknown ---
Slide some to my elbows
And to my fingers if you would
Slide some oil to me, girl
Whoo! Don't that feel good!
--- Unknown ---
Slide some oil to my feet, look
I got toes again
Come on and slide some oil to my knees
And let me see if I can bend
--- Unknown ---
Slide some oil to me
I'm beginning to feel just fine
Slide some oil down my throat
And let me lubricate my mind
--- Unknown ---
Slide some oil to me
go ahead, hit my shoulder blades
Those who don't have to lubricate
Sure got it made
Slide some oil to me
Let it slip down my side
Laying here in one position
Sure does make me tired
--- Unknown ---
Now watch me dance!
