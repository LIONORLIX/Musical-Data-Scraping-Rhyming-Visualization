------ Can I Go On ------
--- Unknown ---
Dorothy
Lose it?
Lose it?
I don't even know the first thing
About what they're feeling
What am I afraid of?
Don't know what I'm made of
Can I go on
Not knowing?
--- Unknown ---
Feeling?
Feeling?
Something tells me
That it's more than I can deal with
Though I never knew the song
Some words still catch on
Like caring and sharing
Being together no matter
--- Unknown ---
Can I go on
Not knowing?
Don't know what I'm made of
Why am I afraid of feeling?
Feelings?
If I dare to take a chance
