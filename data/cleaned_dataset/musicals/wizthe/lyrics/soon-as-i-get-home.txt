------ Soon as I Get Home ------
--- Unknown ---
Dorothy
There's a feeling here inside
That I cannot hide
And I know I've tried
But it's turning me around
I'm not sure that I'm aware
If I'm up or down
Or here or there
I need both feet on the ground
--- Unknown ---
Maybe I'm just going crazy
Let myself get uptight
I'm acting just like a baby
But I'm gonna be
I'm gonna be alright
Soon as I get home
Soon as I get home
Soon as I get home
--- Unknown ---
In a different place
In a different time
Different people around me
I would like to know of their different world
And how different they find me
--- Unknown ---
And just what's a Wiz
Is he big, will he scare me?
If I ask to leave
Will the Wiz even hear me?
How will I know then
If I'll ever get home again?
--- Unknown ---
Here I am alone
Though it feels the same
I don't know where I'm going
I'm here on my own
And it's not a game
And a strange wind is blowing
--- Unknown ---
I'm so amazed
At the things that I see here
Don't want to be afraid
I just don't want to be afraid
I just don't want to be here
In my mind this is clear
What am I doing here?
--- Unknown ---
I wish I was home
--- Unknown ---
I wish
I wish
