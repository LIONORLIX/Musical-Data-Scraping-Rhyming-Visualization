------ If You Believe (Reprise) ------

Glinda
If you believe
Within your heart you'll know
That no one can change
The path that you must go
Believe what you feel
And know you're right because
The time will come around
When you'll say it's yours
--- Unknown ---
Believe that you can go home
Believe you can float on air
Then click your heels three times
If you believe,
Then you'll be there.
--- Unknown ---
Believe in yourself
Right from the start
Believe in the magic
Right there in your heart
Go ahead believe all these things
Not because I told you to
But believe in yourself
If you believe in yourself
Just believe in yourself
