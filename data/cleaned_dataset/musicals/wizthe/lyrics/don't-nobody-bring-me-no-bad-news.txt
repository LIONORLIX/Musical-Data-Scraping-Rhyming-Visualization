------ Don't Nobody Bring Me No Bad News ------
--- Unknown ---
Evilene and The Winkies
When I wake up in the afternoon
Which it pleases me to do
Don't nobody bring me no bad news
'Cause I wake up already negative
And I've wired up my fuse
So don't nobody bring me no bad news
--- Unknown ---
If we're going to be buddies
Better bone up on the rules
'Cause don't nobody bring me no bad news
You can be my best of friends
As opposed to payin' dues
But don't nobody bring me no bad news
--- Unknown ---
No bad news
No bad news
Don't you ever bring me no bad news
'Cause I'll make you an offer, child
That you cannot refuse
So don't nobody bring me no bad news
--- Unknown ---
When you're talking to me
Don't be cryin' the blues
'Cause don't nobody bring me no bad news
You can verbalize and vocalize
But just bring me the clues
But don't nobody bring me no bad news
--- Unknown ---
Bring some message in your head
Or in something you can't lose
But don't you ever bring me no bad news
I'f you're gonna bring me something
Bring me, something I can use
