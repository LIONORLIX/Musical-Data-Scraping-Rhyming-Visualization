--- Unknown ---
Y'ALL GOT IT!
--- The Wiz ---
I got to leave
So I packed my bags
And I'm goin'
--- Unknown ---
I gotta date
So don't you ask me to stay
Cause I'm showin'
--- Unknown ---
You were always ready
For new wizardry
Musta thought that miracles
Came easy to me!
--- Unknown ---
Here's what I'll give you
And put it up on the shelf
Cause now it's time for this here wiz
To wiz on himself!
And I'm wizzin'
--- Unknown ---
Give me a reason why I should stay
And I'll judge it.
My, my, my, My mind is made up
And nothin' you say's gonna budge it.
--- Unknown ---
Y'all copped a whole lotta magic from me
But here's the greatest magic
That you'll ever see
--- Unknown ---
If you blink more than one time
The kid will be gone
And you will have to hook up
The rest on your own
And you know what I think about that?
--- Unknown ---
Your work's cut out for you
It's not about Ifs, Buts, or Ands
Cause when I leave this job
I'm leavin' it all in your hands
--- Unknown ---
I packed up my clothes
And I packed up my power
I'm leavin' this place
In less than one half an hour
--- Unknown ---
If you look up in the sky
You'll know just who it is
It's not a bird, it's not a plane
It's just the little ole' Wiz!
And guess who it's on after that?
--- Citizens of Oz ---
Y'all got it
Y'all got it
Y'all got it
--- The Wiz ---
I'm talkin' bout leavin' here
