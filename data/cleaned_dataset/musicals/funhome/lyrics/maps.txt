Make this part look rugged
Mmm-mmm
Allegheny plateau
This dark shaded stripe
Bum bum bum
Is the front
--- Unknown ---
Paint the long ridges
And valleys below
Mmm-mmm
Our town is this dot
--- Unknown ---
Quick dashes mark the property ends
Beach creek
A road that turns and bends
Little squares for houses
Strung along roads
The land transfigured
Into topographic codes
--- Unknown ---
Maps show you what is simple and true
I'm laying out a bird's eye view
Where did he travel?
What did he see?
A sweeping atlas
of my dad's mythology
--- Unknown ---
Dad was born on this farm
Here's our house
Here's the spot where he died
I can draw a circle
His whole life fits inside
--- Unknown ---
Four miles from our door
I-80 ran from shore to shore
On its way from the Castro
To Christopher Street
The road not taken
Just four miles from our door
--- Unknown ---
You were born on this farm
Here's our house
Here's the spot where you died
I can draw a circle
I can draw a circle
