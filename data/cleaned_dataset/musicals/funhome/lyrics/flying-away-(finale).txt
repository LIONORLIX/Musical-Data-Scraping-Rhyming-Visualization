------ Flying Away (Finale) ------
--- ALISON ---
Daddy, comma,
Hey, Daddy, come here, okay, question mark?
I need you.
--- SMALL ALISON ---
Daddy, hey, Daddy, come here, okay?
I need you.
--- MEDIUM ALISON ---
At the light, at the light, at the light, at the light.
--- ALISON ---
What are you doing, comma,
I said come here.
You need to do what I tell you to do.
--- SMALL ALISON ---
What are you doing?
I said come here!
You need to do what I tell you to do.
Listen to me!
Daddy, come here.
Hey, right here, right now!
You're making me mad.
Listen to me,
Listen to me.
Listen to me.
--- MEDIUM ALISON ---
At the light.
How does it feel to know
--- SMALL ALISON ---
I want to play airplane.
--- MEDIUM ALISON ---
That you and I
--- SMALL ALISON ---
I want to play airplane.
--- MEDIUM ALISON ---
That you and I
--- SMALL ALISON ---
I want to play airplane.
--- ALISON ---
I want to put my arms out and fly.
--- SMALL ALISON ---
Like the Red Baron in a Sopwith Camel!
--- MEDIUM ALISON ---
I was like you.
--- SMALL ALISON ---
No, wait.
Like Superman!
--- ALISON ---
Up in the sky,
--- MEDIUM ALISON ---
Say something!
--- ALISON ---
Til I can see all of Pennsylvania.
--- MEDIUM ALISON ---
Say something!
--- SMALL ALISON ---
Put your feet here like this.
Daddy, do what I say.
--- ALISON ---
There you aren't dead.
--- SMALL ALISON ---
Take my hand, give me yours.
Bend your kneesâ€“ not that way.
--- ALISON ---
There you are.
--- SMALL ALISON ---
When I say go, you start pushing me up.
Okay.
--- MEDIUM ALISON ---
Don't let go yet.
--- ALISON ---
Don't let go yet.
--- SMALL ALISON ---
Okay, higher, just a little.
--- ALISON ---
And now I'm flying away.
--- MEDIUM ALISON ---
Look at me fly away.
--- SMALL ALISON ---
In my wristband and cape.
--- ALL THREE ---
Fly up so high.
--- SMALL ALISON ---
Our house is over there,
And there's our car.
The Fun Home, I see it.
I'm up so far!
Daddy, there's your school!
And there's Grandma's house.
There's Uncle Pete's farm.
--- MEDIUM ALISON ---
So far.
--- ALL THREE ---
I can see all of Pennsylvania.
I can see all of Pennsylvania.
Fly away.
--- SMALL ALISON ---
This is the best game!
Up in the air!
--- ALISON ---
A picture of my father
--- SMALL ALISON ---
And I don't even care that it pushes my stomach in.
--- ALISON ---
Made of little marks.
--- ALL THREE ---
Fly up so high.
Fly up so high.
Fly up so high.
--- SMALL ALISON ---
I can see all of Pennsylvania.
