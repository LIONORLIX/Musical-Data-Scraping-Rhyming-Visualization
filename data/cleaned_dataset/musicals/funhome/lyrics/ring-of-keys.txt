------ Ring of Keys ------
--- ALISON [Spoken]  ---
You didn't notice her at first but I saw her the moment she walked in
She was a delivery woman
She came in with a hand cart full of packages,
She was an old school butch.
--- SMALL ALISON ---
Someone just came in the door.
Like no one I ever saw before.
I feel...
I feel...
--- Unknown ---
I don't know where you came from.
I wish I did
I feel so dumb.
I feel...
--- Unknown ---
Your swagger and your bearing
and the just right clothes you're wearing
Your short hair and your dungarees
And your lace up boots.
--- Unknown ---
And your keys oh
Your ring of keys.
--- Unknown ---
I thought it was s'pposed to be wrong
But you seem okay with being strong
I want...to...
You're so...
--- Unknown ---
It's probably conceited to say,
But I think we're alike in a certain way
I...um...
--- Unknown ---
Your swagger and your bearing
and the just right clothes you're wearing
Your short hair and your dungarees
And your lace up boots.
--- Unknown ---
And your keys oh
Your ring of keys.
--- Unknown ---
Do you feel my heart saying hi?
In this whole luncheonette
Why am I the only one who see you're beautiful?
--- Spoken ---
No, I mean
--- Sung ---
Handsome!
--- Unknown ---
Your swagger and your bearing
and the just right clothes you're wearing
Your short hair and your dungarees
And your lace up boots.
--- Unknown ---
And your keys oh
Your ring of keys.
--- Unknown ---
I know you
I know you
I know you
