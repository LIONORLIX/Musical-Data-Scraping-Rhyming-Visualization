------ Edges of the World ------
--- BRUCE ---
I fucking love beginnings,
Flying high!
It's hard to know where to start.
It's all so fast,
I'm trying not to spin.
I guess I'm older,
And it's harder when you're older to begin.
--- Unknown ---
Peeling plaster,
Sagging roof,
Two missing stairs,
A buckled wall.
I'm fired up to do this,
But on my own for it allâ€¦
--- Unknown ---
So much damage,
Broken windows,
Pipes are shit,
Crap veneer.
It's hours later,
Jesus, I'm still standing here,
Still standing here.
--- Unknown ---
But when the sunlight hits the parlor wall
At certain times of day,
I see how fine this house could be.
I see it so damn clear!
What's the matter?
Why am I standing here?
--- Unknown ---
Bad foundation,
Twisting floorboards,
Shoddy pipes,
A gaping hole.
It's a lot,
It's a lot to keep under control.
--- Unknown ---
Something's cracking,
Something's rotting.
Piles of ruin and debris
Killing me,
Crushing me,
Pushing me!
--- Unknown ---
But when the sunlight hits the parlor wall
At certain times of day,
I see how fine this house could be.
I see it so damn clear!
What's the matter?
Why am I standing here?
--- Unknown ---
Dear Al, I'm scared.
I had a life I thought I understood.
I took it and I squeezed out every bit of life I could.
But the edges of the world that held me up have gone away,
And I'm falling into nothingness
Or flying into something so sublime.
--- Unknown ---
And I'm
A man I don't know.
Who am I now?
Where do I go?
I can't go back.
I can't find my way through.
I might still break a heart or two!
--- Unknown ---
But when the sunlight hits the parlor wall
At certain times of day,
I see how fine this house could be.
I see it so damn clear!
Oh my god,
Why am I standing here?
