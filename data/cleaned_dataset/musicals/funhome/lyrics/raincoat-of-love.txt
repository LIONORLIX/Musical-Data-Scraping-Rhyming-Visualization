------ Raincoat of Love ------
--- Unknown ---
Today I woke up with a feeling that I did not recognize
Oh, our happy life seemed far away and everything was made of lies
The sky was turning dark when baby I looked in your eyes
And that's when I knew
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh
--- Unknown ---
Everything's alright, babe, when we're together
'Cause you are like a raincoat made out of love
Magic shield of love protecting me from bad weather
You are like a raincoat made out of love
A raincoat of love love love love love
--- Unknown ---
Everything's alright, babe, when we're together
'Cause you are like a raincoat made out of love
Magic shield of love protecting me from bad weather
You are like a raincoat made out of love
A raincoat of love
A raincoat of love
--- Unknown ---
Everything's alright babe when we're together
Everything's alright babe when we're together
Everything's alright babe when we're together
Everything's alright
Everything's alright
Everything's alright
