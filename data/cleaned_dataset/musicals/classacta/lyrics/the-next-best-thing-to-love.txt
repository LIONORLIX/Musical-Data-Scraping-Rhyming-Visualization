------ The next best thing to love ------
--- Unknown ---
We had the smiles
We had the tunes
We had a multitude of lovely afternoons
And come to think of it
It was the next best thing to love
And though we falled
There was no pain
The sex was good but never great
Need I explain ?
And come to think of it
It was the next best thing to love
Something always missing
Christmas in LA
We could get to april
Not to may
And so at last
We let it go
Because it doesnâ€™t take too genuises to know
that when you think of it
and it is well worth thinking of
It was the next best thing to love
Couldnâ€™t turn the corner
Never made sublime
Still we should be so lucky
All the time
So no regret
Forget the tears
I know a dozen girls whoâ€™d run with this for years
And come to think of it
I guess the next best thing to love
Is also love
