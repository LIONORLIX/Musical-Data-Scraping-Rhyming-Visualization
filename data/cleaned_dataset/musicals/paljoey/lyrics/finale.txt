--- Unknown ---
Wise at last
My eyes at last
Are cutting you down to your size at last
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered no more
--- Unknown ---
Burned a lot
But learned a lot
And now you are broke, though you earned a lot
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered no more
--- Unknown ---
Couldn't eat
Was dyspeptic
Life was so hard to bear;
Now my heart's antiseptic
Since you moved out of there
--- Unknown ---
Romance-Finis
Your chance-finis
Those ants that invaded my pants-finis
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered no more.
