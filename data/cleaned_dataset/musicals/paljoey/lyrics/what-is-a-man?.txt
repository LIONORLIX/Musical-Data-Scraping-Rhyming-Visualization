--- Unknown ---
There are so many, so many fish in the sea,
must I want the one who?s not for me?

What can I do about it?

to be without it.

What is a man?
Is he an animal
is he a wolf
is he a mouse
is he the cheap or the dear kind,
is he champagne or the beer kind?

What is a man?
Is he a stimulant
good for the heart
bad for the nerves?
Nature's mistake since the world begun.
What makes me give?
What makes me live?
What is this thing called man?

Hello Jack can't keep the appointment,
have an awful cold [sneeze].
Hello Frank
have to meet my husband.
So long, please don't scold.
Hello-Hello-love.

What is a man?
is he an ornament?
useless by day
and dear by night.
Nature's mistake since the world begun.
All have one trick
one that is slick.
