My funny Valentine
Sweet comic Valentine
You make me smile with my heart
Your looks are laughable
Unphotographable
Yet you're my favourite work of art
--- Unknown ---
Is your figure less than Greek
Is your mouth a little weak
When you open it to speak
Are you smart?
--- Unknown ---
But don't change a hair for me
Not if you care for me
Stay little Valentine stay
Each day is Valentine's day

Is your figure less than Greek

Are you smart?

But don't change a hair for me
Not if you care for me
Stay little Valentine stay
Each day is Valentine's day
