------ The Lady is a Tramp ------
--- Unknown ---
She gets too hungry, for dinner at eight
She likes the theater, and never comes late
She'd never bother, with people she'd hate
That's why the lady is a tramp
--- Unknown ---
Doesn't like crap games, with barons or earls
Won't go to Harlem, in ermine and pearls
Won't dish the dirt, with the rest of the girls
That's why the lady is a tramp
--- Unknown ---
She likes the free, free fresh wind in her hair
Life without care
She's broke, but it's o'k
She hates California, it's cold and it's damp
That's why the lady is a tramp

Won't have a dice game, with any barons or earls
She will never go to Harlem, dessed in ermine and pearls
And she won't dish the dirt, with all the other girls
That is why the lady is a tramp

She loves the free, free, fresh wind in her hair
Life without care

That's why the lady
