------ Bewitched, Bothered And Bewildered ------
--- Unknown ---
She's a fool and don't I know it
But a fool can have her charms
I'm in love and don't I show it
Like a babe in arms
--- Unknown ---
Men, are not a new sensation
I've done pretty well I think
But this half-pint imitation
Put me on the blink
--- Unknown ---
I'm wild again, beguilded again
A simpering, whimpering child again
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I
--- Unknown ---
Couldn't sleep, and wouldn't sleep
And ------ I do, if I shouldn't sleep
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I
--- Unknown ---
Lost my heart, but what of it?
My mistake I agree
He's a laugh, but I love it
Because the laugh's on me
--- Unknown ---
A pill he is, but still he is
All mine and I'll keep him until he is
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - like me
--- Unknown ---
La, da, da, da, da, di, dam
Mmmmmmm
La, da, da, da, da, da, dam
I guess the laugh's on me
--- Unknown ---
I slept again, I tripped again
The way to my heart is unzipped again
