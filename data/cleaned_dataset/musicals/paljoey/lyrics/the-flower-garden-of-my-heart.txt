------ The Flower Garden Of My Heart ------
--- Unknown ---
I haven't got a great big yacht
but I'm contented with my lot
I've got onething much more beautiful and grand
I do not own a racing horse
but that fill me with remorse
I posess the greatest show piece in the land
so come with me and wander
to a lovely spot out yonder
--- Unknown ---
In the Flower Garden of my heart
I've got violets as blue as your eyes
I've got dainty narcissis as sweet as my missus
And lilies as pure as the sky
--- Unknown ---
In the Flower Garden of my heart
I've roses as red as your mouth
Just to keep our love holy I've got gladioli
And sunflowers fresh from the south
But you are the artist and love is the art
In the flower garden of my heart
--- Unknown ---
Violet, the flower dear ol grandmother wore
way way back when in the days of yore
Sunflower the favorite of white and dusty pixie
way down south in the land of dixie
Heather, sir Harry Lauder sang of it's beauty
The decoration of all scotch cuties
Lily, the flower of youthful purity
it's very sweet you have my surity
Lilac, the sky turns blue and the church bells chime
ah love, we love sweet lilac time
If you're a hundred percent american goodness knows
you'll love the american beauty rose
--- Unknown ---
In the flower garden of my heart
I've got daisies to tell me you're true
Or the west wind will whisk us
the scent of hibiscus
And heather that's smothered with you
--- Unknown ---
In the flower garden of my heart
I've got lilacs and dainty sweet peas
You will look like sweet Willium
and smell like a trillum
Surrounded by fond bumblebees
But you are the archer
and I am the dot
