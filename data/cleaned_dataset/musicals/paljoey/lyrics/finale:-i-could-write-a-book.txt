------ Finale: I Could Write a Book ------
--- Unknown ---
If they asked me, I could write a book;
About the way you walk, and whisper;
And look.
I could write a preface;
On how we met;
That the world will never forget.
--- Unknown ---
And the simple;
Secret of the plot;
Is just to tell them;
That I love you, alot.
Then the world discovers;
As my book ends;
