------ There's A Small Hotel ------
--- Unknown ---
There's a small hotel
With a wishing well
I wish that we were there together
There's a bridal suite
One room bright and neat
Complete for us to share together
--- Unknown ---
Looking through the window
You can see that distant steeple
Not a sign of people -- who wants people?
When the steeple bell says,
Good night, sleep well,
We'll thank the small hotel together
--- Unknown ---
And when the steeple bell says,
Good night, sleep well,
