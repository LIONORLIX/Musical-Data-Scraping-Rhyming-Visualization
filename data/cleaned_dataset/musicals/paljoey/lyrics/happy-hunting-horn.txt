------ Happy Hunting Horn ------
--- VERSE ---
Don’t worry, girls,
I’m only on vacation,
Not out of circulation;
Don’t worry, girls.
--- Unknown ---
Don’t worry, girls,
While I still have my eyesight
You’re going to be in my sight;
Don’t worry, girls.
You never can erase
The hunter from the chase.
--- REFRAIN ---
Sound the happy hunting horn,
There’s new game on the trail now;
We’re hunting for quail now,
Happy little hunting horn.
--- Unknown ---
Play the horn but don’t play corn.
The music must be nice now,
We’re hunting for mice now,
Happy little hunting horn.
--- Unknown ---
Danger’s easy to endure when
You’re out to catch a beaut;
Lie in ambush, but be sure when
You see the whites of their eyes-don’t shoot!
--- Unknown ---
Play the horn from night to morn.
Just play, no matter what time,
Play, “There’ll be a hot time!”
