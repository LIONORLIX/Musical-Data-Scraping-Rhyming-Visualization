------ That Terrific Rainbow ------
--- Unknown ---
My life had no color, before I met you
What could have been duller, the times I went through
You weakened my resistance, and colored my existence
I'm happy, and unhappy too
--- Unknown ---
I'm a red hot Mama, but I'm blue for you
I get purple with anger, at the things you do
And I'm green with envy, when you meet a dame
But you burn my heart up with an orange flame.
--- Unknown ---
I'm a red hot mama, but you white and cold
Don't you know your Mama has a heart of gold
Though we're in those grey clouds, someday you see
