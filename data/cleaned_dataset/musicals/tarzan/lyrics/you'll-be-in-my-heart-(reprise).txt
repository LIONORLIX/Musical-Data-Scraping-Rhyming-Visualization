------ You'll Be In My Heart (Reprise) ------
--- Tarzan ---
Don't be afraid
It will be all right
Just take my hand
Hold it tight
--- Unknown ---
No metter where I am, I'll be with you
Just think on me
Don't you cry
--- Tarzan & Kala ---
No one could understand the way we feel
How would they know, how can we explain?
Althought we're different, deep inside us
We're not that different at all
--- Unknown ---
'Cause you'll in my heart
Yes, you'll be in my heart
From this day on
Now and forever more
--- Tarzan ---
You'll be in my heart
--- Kala ---
You'll be in my heart
--- Tarzan ---
No matter what they say
--- Kala ---
Oh, you'll be wit me
--- Tarzan ---
You'll be here in my heart
--- Kala ---
Here in my heart
--- Tarzan ---
Always
--- Kala ---
Always
--- Tarzan ---
Always
--- Kala ---
Always
--- Tazan ---
Mother...
I'll be there for you always
--- Kala ---
Always and always
--- Tarzan ---
Just look over your shoulder
Just look over your shoulder
--- Kala ---
Just look over your shoulder
--- Tarzan ---
Turn around
--- Tarzan ---
And look over your shoulder
--- Kala ---
And look over your shoulder
--- Tarzan ---
'Cause I'll be there always
--- Kala ---
