------ Son of a Man ------
--- Terk ---
Hah!
--- Terk ---
Ohh, the power to be strong
And the wisdom to be wise
All these things will come to you in time
On this journey that you're making
There'll be answers that you'll see
And it's you who'll find a mountain
It's you who'll reach the peak
--- Chorus ---
Son of man look to the sky
Let your spirits set you free
Someday you'll walk tall with pride
Son of man
A man in time you'll be
--- Terk ---
I'll be right here to guide you
And turn to take your hand
With fate and understanding
You will journey from boy to man
--- Unknown ---
Chorus
--- Terk & Kala ---
In learning you will teach
And in teaching you will learn
You'll find your place beside the ones
You love!
--- Ensemble ---
Oh, and all the things you dreamed of
--- Terk ---
All the visions that you saw
--- Ensemble ---
And the time is drawing in now
--- Terk ---
It's your's to claim it all
--- Unknown ---
Chorus

Ooh weh
