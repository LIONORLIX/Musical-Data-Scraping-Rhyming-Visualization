I know you all

Oh, I've been waiting for this moment
Oh, it seems like all my life
Here I am - my head is spinning
Because I'm finally living the life that I dreamed
It seems I've been waiting forever

Mimulus aurantiacus
Pedicularis attollens
Boehmeria tricuspis
I always knew you'd be this beautiful

Here and now nothing matters
Everything I wanted's here
I feel at home, I've found my place
All this beauty before me was out of my reach
I never imagined such wonder
--- Unknown ---
All these friends, I feel like I know them oh so well
And though it's strange I feel they know me too

There's something strangely intoxicating
And it's going to my head
That makes me feel oh so alive
I could stay here forever and never need more
Embracing these wonders of nature

And I can see that, ooh, they want to know me too
--- Unknown ---
It's such a liberating feeling
And it's happening to me
I've never felt this glow inside
--- Unknown ---
New, exciting, inviting, wanting to play
