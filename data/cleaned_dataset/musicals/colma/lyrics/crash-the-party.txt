------ Crash the Party ------
--- Unknown ---
Twenty-one year old appeal
I can?t believe how young I feel
And it makes me feel I?m cool as shit
All the non-conformists gather
?Round to show off wax and lather wit
Everybody?s cool as shit
--- Unknown ---
And no one knows how young we are
We?re all on the same page
No one knows how young we are
That we are underage
Come on! Let?s do a shot
None for me
More for us
--- Unknown ---
Crash the party and they?ll never know
[We?re on the slow and steady]
Act the part and they will never know
[I?m feeling cool already]
Crash the party and they will never know
--- Unknown ---
Maybe I?m not cool enough
To understand this hipster stuff just yet
But there?s one thing I don?t get
Is that what we?re gonna be
When we grow up [What, Loud?]
You see? That?s great
Obnoxious seems to be my fate
As long as he says random things
With funny faces and make
Everything his random thing
There?s only so much I can take
Well, I think he rocks
In that sucky way
Let?s do a shot
--- Unknown ---
Crash the party and they?ll never know
[We?re on the slow and steady]
Act the part and they will never know
[I?m feeling cool already]
Crash the party and they will never know
[This party really fucking blows!]
--- Unknown ---
Is this the bathroom?
Yes it is
[You and me, let?s do a shot of straight Kahlua]
Is there someone in there?
[I?m taking a shit]
[Or perhaps you feel a shot of straight tequila?]
Maybe while I?m standing here
You could grab me an ice cold beer
Sure give me a second
Maribel, you?re being beckoned
--- Unknown ---
[You?re sweating
So are you. You have paint on your face
So do you
No I don?t
Oh, well, I just came from rehearsal
So I didn?t have time to wash the paint off
You?re in a play?
Yeah. I?m a Thespian
Awesome! I?m an actor
I didn?t think I?d meet an actress tonight
Actually, I prefer to be called an actor
Oh, Right. Right. That whole woman thing
That whole woman thing?
Sorry, I didn?t?I didn?t mean?I mean
That?s okay
I should go
Can I get my beer?
Right. Sorry
Wait!]
--- Unknown ---
Crash the party and they?ll never know
[Some things, you can?t reverse it]
Act the part and they will never know
[I?m such a stupid person]
Crash the party and they?re out the door
[We?re on the slow and steady]
Crash the party and then we?ll drink it all
[I?m feeling cool already]
