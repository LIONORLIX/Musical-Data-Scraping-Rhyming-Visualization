------ Deadwalking ------
--- Unknown ---
Deadwalking quietly through the graves
The grass of the graveyard beneath my feet
Ev?ryone sleeping, I feel the hush
My heart steady pulsing the only beat
--- Unknown ---
These are the main Colma Residents
For this is the true population now
Graveyards & tombstones throughout the hills
There?s more of them dead than alive in town
--- Unknown ---
Come dance with me ?til the sun goes down
--- Unknown ---
This is my future main residence
Just deadwalking nowhere and everywhere
No one and everyone knows your name
And nothing and ev?rything in the end
--- Unknown ---
We will be resting beneath the soil
And flying so high up above the ground
Nothing to heinous to worry us
And nothing bad either to cry about
--- Unknown ---
Come dance with me ?til the sun goes down
--- Unknown ---
Deadwalking quietly through the graves
[This is my future main residence]
The grass of the graveyard beneath my feet
[Just deadwalking nowhere and everywhere]
Ev?ryone sleeping, I feel the hush
[No one and everyone knows your name]
My heart steady pulsing the only beat
[And nothing and everything in the end]
--- Unknown ---
These are the main Colma Residents
[We will be resting beneath the soil]
For this is the true population now
[And flying so high up above the ground]
Graveyards & tombstones throughout the hills
[Nothing to heinous to worry us]
There?s more of them dead than alive in town
[And nothing bad either to cry about]
--- Unknown ---
Come dance with me [Come dance with me]
Come dance with me [Come dance with me]
Come dance with me ?til the sun goes down
--- Unknown ---
[By the way, Maribel?
What?
