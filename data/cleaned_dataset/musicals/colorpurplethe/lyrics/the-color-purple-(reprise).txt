Dear god, dear stars, dear trees, dear sky,
Dear peoples, dear everything, dear god,
God is inside me and everyone else
That was or ever will be.
I came into this world with god
And when i finally looked inside, i found it,
Just as close as my breath is to me.

Share love.

Like a blade of corn,
Like a honeybee,
Like a waterfall,
All a part of me.
Like the color purple,
Where do it come from?
Now my eyes are open,
Look what god has done.
