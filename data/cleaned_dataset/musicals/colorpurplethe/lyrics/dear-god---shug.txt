------ Dear God - Shug ------

Celie
Got about a million tingles
Sneakin' on up my spine.
I wash her body and it feel like i'm prayin.
Try not to look, but my eyes ain't obeyin'.
Guess i found out what all of the fuss is about.
Not like nettie, not like sofia,
Not like nobody else up in here.
Shug avery!
Shug
This who they talkin' about.
Celie
I know that.
Shug
And everything they say is true, too,
So you better believe it!
Celie
Shug avery . . .
