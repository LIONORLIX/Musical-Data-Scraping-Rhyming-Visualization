------ The Color Purple ------
--- Unknown ---
Celie
God forgot about me!
Shug
God takin' his time getting around to you, i admit, but look at all he give us.
Laughin', and singin', and sex. Sky over our heads, birds singin' to us. I think it piss
God off if anybody even walk past the color purple in a field and not notice it. He
Say, look what i made for you.
Celie
God just another man, far as i'm concerned, he triflin' and lowdown . . .
Shug
No, celie. God not some gloomy old man like the pictures you've seen of him.
God not a man at all.
God is inside you and everyone else
That was or ever will be.
We come into this world with god.
But only them who look inside find it.
God is the flowers and everything else
That was or ever will be.
And when you feel the truth so real,
And when you love the way you feel, you've found it
Just as sure as moonlight bless the night.
Like a blade of corn,
Like a honeybee,
Like a waterfall,
All a part of me.
Like the color purple,
Where do it come from?
Open up your eyes,
Look what god has done.
Celie
You better be gettin' back. Your husband probably wonderin' where you are.
Shug
Where do you want to be, celie?
Celie
With you.
Shug
All right then.
Celie
God gon' take me to live with you?
Shug
Come on.
