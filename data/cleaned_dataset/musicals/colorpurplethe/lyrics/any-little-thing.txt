------ Any Little Thing ------
--- Unknown ---
Harpo
I fed the chickens and i chopped the wood,
And then i put up the peaches like you said i should.
I mended the fences and painted 'em, too.
Now, is there anything i can do for you?
Sofia
I milked twelve heifers by the early morn',
And then i shucked about a hundred ears of corn.
I scrubbed all your britches 'til they look brand new.
Now, is there anything i can do for you?
Harpo & sofia
Any little thing you might want me to?
Sofia
I rubbed magnolia petals on my skin.
Harpo
Mmmm, i cut my toenails and shaved my chin.
Sofia
I'll turn out the light.
Harpo
I'll pour the brew.
Harpo & sofia
Now, is there anything else i can do for you?
Any little thing you might want me to?
