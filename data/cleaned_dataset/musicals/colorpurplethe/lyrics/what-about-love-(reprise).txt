------ What About Love (Reprise) ------
--- SHUG ---
Celie, all I ask is six months to have my last fling.
CELIE
BUT WHAT ABOUT TRUST?
SHUG
I got to have it, Celie. I'm too weak a woman not to.
CELIE
WHAT ABOUT TENDERNESS?
SHUG
But if you just give me six months, I'll try to make our life together what it was.
CELIE
WHAT ABOUT TEARS WHEN I'M HAPPY?
SHUG
When it's over, I'll come back to Georgia. Live there if you want.
CELIE
WHAT ABOUT WINGS WHEN I FALL?
SHUG
My heart hurt so much for sayin' this to you.
CELIE
YOU SAID YOU WOULD BE
SHUG
I love this boy and I'm scared to death . . .
CELIE
A STORY FOR ME
SHUG
You know this boy gon' hurt me twice as much as I'm hurtin' you, . . .
CELIE
THAT I COULD BELIEVE IN FOREVER.
SHUG
. . . please just forgive me . . .

CELIE
AND WHAT ABOUT . . .
SHUG
