Celie
Dear nettie, i went back home. The house was okay, but the store was a dusty mess.
But i fixed it up, and now i'm makin' pants for anybody who wants 'em. I change the
Cloth, i change the print, i change the waist, i change the pocket. Only thing i can't
Do is quit makin' 'em.
All i need's a needle and a spool of thread.
Got about a million patterns in my head.
All the ladies' legs are gonna love to dance
When they in miss celie's pants.
