Dear God,
I love this woman!
My friend, sofia.
Harpo, he love her
And he smile ev'rytime he see her.
I ain't never seen such a vision!
Cow bossin' the bull around.
Ain't afraid o' nothin'
When she lay her law down.
Took harpo's hand,
Now she havin' his babies.
She rule the house an' its drivin' him crazy.
