------ Too Beautiful For Words ------
--- Unknown ---
Shug
You not ugly. You the grace of god if us ever see it.
You don't believe me.
Miss celie . . . Miss celie, look here. Look at yourself.
I've always been the kind of gal
That had a lot to say.
I says the things that's on my mind,
Too dumb to shy away.
But you hush my mouth and still me
With a song i've never heard.
I guess that means that you are just
Too beautiful for words.
I've seen this life from high and low
And all that's in between.
I danced with dukes, crooned with counts,
Been courted like a queen.
But when i see what's in your heart,
All the rest is blurred.
The grace you bring into this world's
Too beautiful for words.
You hide your head under your wing
Just like a little bird.
Oh, don't you know you're beautiful,
Too beautiful for words?
Celie, you're too beautiful for words.
