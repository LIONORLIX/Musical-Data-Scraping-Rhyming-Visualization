Dear celie, oh, i love you.
Years go by and still you're with me.
All we share is one big sky.
I pray for your reply.
I teach your children a-b-cs
For a missionary family.
These babies sent by god are yours,
Nettie & celie
Adam and olivia - alive, alive!
Nettie
I vibrated like a bell
When i saw the african coast.
And i kneeled down and thanked god.
Celie
Thank god
Nettie & celie
Thank god
Nettie
For letting us see the land
Where our mothers and fathers died.
African homeland, homeland.

It was like black seeing black
For the first time.
Shiny blue black people looking real fine
In brilliant blue robes
That fly on the winds
Like a beautiful quilt
Stitched together by friends.
Celie
You could put everything i knew
In a thimble.
What we're taught to be
Don't resemble
The kings and queens
Who for thousands of years
Ruled magnificent cities
Washed away by tears.
The chief
Ah too bah yah!
The hunt drums begin.
The chief
Ah too bah yahhhh!

Our village was destroyed by the white soldiers, so now we have walked with so
Many other refugees to a tent camp across the border. I don't know how i will mail
This letter.
We walk away from this ravaged land
With courage deep in our hearts
To face the unknown
Nettie & olinka
Together.
Nettie
We'll find a place where we can be,
Where spirit rise and soul is free.
Oh, people,
Olinka
Oon day unndala!
Nettie
My people
Olinka
Oon day unndala!
Nettie
I have faith that god will let us see each other again before we die. And you must
Have faith too, celie. I only hope when that day comes, we are not too old to
Recognize each other. Your sister,
All men
We walk away
We walk away ahummmmmm, hummmmmm, hummmmmm
