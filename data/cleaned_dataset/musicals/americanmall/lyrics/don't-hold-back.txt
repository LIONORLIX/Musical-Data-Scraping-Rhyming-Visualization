Verse 1
turn up the volume open the door wanna little somethin wanna a little something more dont look for easy, easy comes hard
take the road less traffic dont forget your own backyard rattle some cages dont have to play nice ask a million questions and
never ask the same thing twice no indecision that time has passed go a little crazy and find a way to make it last you can
move right up to the head of the class but not if you sit on your big fat whoo

dont hold back make some noise let em know you were here dont hold back make some noise let em know you were here if you
stop and think your chance will disappear dont hold back make some noise let em know you were here

Verse 2
hold like you mean it dance like you should finding directions you maxed out and it's all good going the distance arms
opened wide reach a little higher and find some funk you'll keep inside and you might wake up famous and filthy rich but not
if all you do is sit around that whoo
