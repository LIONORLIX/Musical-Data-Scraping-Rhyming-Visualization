------ Survivor ------
--- Unknown ---
I just woke up from a fractured fairy tale
I bought the dream but didn't read the small details
Oh which road I should take, I thought I could see it
You led me ashtray and now I feel cheated
I let you break my heart and bleed it
I know it
--- Unknown ---
But I finally learned that I hate to lose
Found out something I gotta prove
--- Unknown ---
I'm a survivor
Scream it loud and strong
I'm a survivor
That's right, bring it on
--- Unknown ---
I'm taking back the part I gave away
And I'll never do it again unless it's an even trade
I opened my heart, like a fool I trusted
A light in the dark, until you unplugged it
Love left a mark but I rise above it
I know it
--- Unknown ---
Every mistake that I ever made
Made me who I am today
--- Unknown ---
I'm a survivor
Scream it loud and strong
I'm a survivor
That's right, bring it on
--- Unknown ---
The princess opens up her eyes without a kiss
For that she won't forgive
Because this good girl's pissed...!
--- Unknown ---
I'm a survivor
Scream it loud and strong
I'm a survivor
That's right, bring it on
--- Unknown ---
Every mistake that I ever made
Made me who I am today
--- Unknown ---
I'm a survivor
Scream it loud and strong
I'm a survivor
That's right, bring it on!
