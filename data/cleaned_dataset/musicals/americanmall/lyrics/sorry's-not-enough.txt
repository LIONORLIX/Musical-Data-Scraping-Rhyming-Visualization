------ Sorry's Not Enough ------
--- Unknown ---
I'm sorry can't save a heart
When it breaks and scattered in the wind
How can two worlds cover the half
The others been living in
--- Unknown ---
Oh I never believed I'd ever need
Any more than I did before
--- Unknown ---
When sorry's not enough
There's nowhere left to turn
Too much to forgive
Tell me where is the answer
How do you find the strength
The strength to let it go
We need to just to leave
When sorry's not enough
--- Unknown ---
Love can fall hard
Leaving the scar that remembers
How bad it burns
We won't pretend where next time begins
Cause we need just to live and learn
--- Unknown ---
Although now I believe that I'm gonna need
A little more than I did before
--- Unknown ---
Sorry's not enough
There's nowhere left to turn
Too much to forgive
Tell me where is the answer
How do you find the strength
The strength to let it go
We need to just to leave
When sorry's not enough
--- Unknown ---
No there's no going back
And tomorrow is all we're gonna have
So we will have
--- Unknown ---
Sorry's not enough
There's nowhere left to turn
Too much to forgive
Tell me where is the answer
How do you find the strength
The strength to let it go
We need to just to leave
Oh just to leave baby
