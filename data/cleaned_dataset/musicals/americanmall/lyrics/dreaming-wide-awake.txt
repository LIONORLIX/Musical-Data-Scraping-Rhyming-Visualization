------ Dreaming Wide Awake ------
--- Unknown ---
When gray meets light
It creates new colors
That stay lost inside
Till they find each other
--- Unknown ---
Then the world that you've never seen before
Starts moving in slow motion
--- Unknown ---
Am I living now out loud
'Cause I can't hide me from you
And I'm not afraid somehow
To let you see right through me
Wait, I must be dreaming wide awake
--- Unknown ---
This world's so real
Like a kaleidoscope made clear
To touch, to feel
What if we made it disappear
--- Unknown ---
With just a tangle, you might change
I'd rather breathe this moment
--- Unknown ---
Am I living now out loud
'Cause I can't hide me from you
And I'm not afraid somehow
To let you see right through me
Wait, I must be dreaming wide awake
--- Unknown ---
Am I living now out loud
'Cause I can't hide me from you
And I'm not afraid somehow
To let you see right through me
No
Am I living now out loud
'Cause I can't hide me from you
And I'm not afraid somehow
To let you see right through me
I must be dreaming wide awake
I must be dreaming
