------ Every 10 Seconds ------
--- Unknown ---
No time to wait for no one
No one gets in for free
It's time we got it goin
Well I got tunnel vision
Can't think of nothing else
Turn on the televison
--- Unknown ---
And I can see myself
I'm a star in a rock band
Signin all them autographs
--- Unknown ---
Cause don't you that
--- Unknown ---
(Chorus)
Every 10 seconds
Someone's changing the world
Someone's breaking the rules
And Someone kissed a girl
--- Unknown ---
(Chorus 2)
Every 10 seconds
There's a runner crossing over the line
--- Unknown ---
Send my application
I've got nothing to lose
Looking at my watch and it's a quarter to
--- Unknown ---
Everything I want
I can see it, see it in my mind
--- Unknown ---
It's just a matter of time (time, time)(x2)
--- Unknown ---
And it takes blind ambition
To rock the industry
I'll make somebody listen
--- Unknown ---
I'm gonna play my song
Gonna hear it on the radio
Driving down the freeway
That's what I say
--- Unknown ---
Every 10 seconds
Someone's changing the world
Someone's breaking the rules
And Someone kissed a girl
--- Unknown ---
Every 10 seconds
There's a runner crossing over the line
--- Unknown ---
Send my application
I've got nothing to lose
Looking at my watch and it's a quarter to
--- Unknown ---
Everything I want
Gotta do what it takes to get mine
--- Unknown ---
It's just a matter of time
--- Unknown ---
1, 2 ,1, 2 ,3
--- Unknown ---
I'm gonna play my song
Gonna hear it on the radio
Driving down the freeway
That's what I say
--- Unknown ---
Every 10 seconds
Someone's changing the world
Someone's breaking the rules
And Someone kissed a girl
--- Unknown ---
Every 10 seconds
There's a runner crossing over the line
--- Unknown ---
Send my application
I've got nothing to lose
Looking at my watch and it's a quarter to
--- Unknown ---
Everything I want
Gotta do what it takes to get mine
--- Unknown ---
It's just a matter of time
