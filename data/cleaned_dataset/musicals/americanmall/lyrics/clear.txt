------ Clear ------
--- Unknown ---
On my way, though I don't know where I'm going
On a road that's dark and long
On my way, but I'm fearful that I could be lost
That the path I have chosen might be wrong
--- Unknown ---
When will it be clear that I made the right choice
When can I be sure that I know my own voice
I dream of a day when I'm free from doubt
Where fate winds out
And I overcome my fear
Clear
--- Unknown ---
I don't know where to search for answers
In a world that is afraid
Will I find my strength
And discover who I really I am
Or retreat every time when I don't care
--- Unknown ---
When will it be clear that I made the right choice
When can I be sure that I know my own voice
I dream of a day when I'm free from doubt
Where fate winds out
And I overcome my fear
Clear
--- Unknown ---
I've been told that we learn from our mistakes
But I just don't know how many mistakes it takes
I'm trying so hard to let down my guard
Maybe right now, right here
--- Unknown ---
Clear, that I made the right choice
Sure, that I know my own voice
This is the day when I'm free from doubt
Where fate winds out
And I overcome my fear
