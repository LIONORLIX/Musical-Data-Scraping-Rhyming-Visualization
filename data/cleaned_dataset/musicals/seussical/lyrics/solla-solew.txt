There's a faraway land
So the stories all tell
Somewhere beyond the horizon.
If we can find it
Then all will be well,
Troubles there are few,
Someday, we'll go to...

I've lost my poor Whos
And we've traveled so far.
Oh, JoJo, forgive me
Wherever you are.

(We see JOJO at military school, writing a letter. MR. and MRS.
MAYOR are home, reading his letter.)
--- JOJO ---
Dear Mom and Dad,
I'm thinking of you.
And wishing we all were in Solla Sollew
--- MAYOR ---
They say breezes are warm there
--- HORTON ---
And people are kind.
--- JOJO, HORTON ---
Maybe it's something like heaven.
--- JOJO, MAYOR, MRS. MAYOR, HORTON ---
I close my eyes
And I see in my mind
Skies of bluest blue
--- CIRCUS ANIMALS, ALL ---
Solla Sollew
--- HORTON ---
I've had so much trouble JOJO, MAYOR,
Finding my way there. MRS. MAYOR &
When I get close, CIRCUS ANIMALS
It disappears. Solla Sollew
If we can get there,
We're gonna stay there
If it takes us miles,
--- JOJO, MAYOR AND MRS. MAYOR ---
If it takes us miles
--- HORTON ---
If it takes us years.

High on a mountain
Or lost on the sea,
--- HORTON & JOJO ---
Sooner or later, I'll find it
--- MAYOR ---
I have a picture
Of how it will be
--- MAYOR & MRS. MAYOR ---
On the day I do
--- HORTON & MAYOR & MRS. MAYOR & JOJO ---
Troubles will be through
And I'll be home with you.
