------ Notice Me, Horton ------
--- GERTRUDE ---
It's taken all my courage to approach you
Not to mention all my stamina to follow you
Across the hills and deserts.
But I feel as if I'm ready
To confess to you the feelings
That I've hidden with great diligence and labor...
Behind the fa?ade
Of your odd little next-door neighbor.
--- Unknown ---
My eyes are too small.
I have very large feet.
And I'm not very proud of my pitiful tweet
But I've now got a tail
That is something to see...
--- HORTON ---
One hundred and two. One hundred and three.
--- GERTRUDE ---
Oh, notice me, Horton, feather by feather.
This is your next-door neighbor calling!
Notice me, Horton.
Horton, together
We could be great
Oh, notice me, Horton
Put down the clover!
This is your next door neighbor calling.
There's a new leaf
Your neighbor's turned over
--- HORTON ---
Over and over,
Clover by clover...
--- GERTRUDE, HORTON ---
I was just a no one only yesterday.
You showed up and showed me something more.
Now I've become a someone
Who has someone to believe in
And to be there for...
--- Unknown ---
(HORTON continues his search)
--- GERTRUDE ---
I will not give up hope.
I was hooked from the start
When I noticed your kind
And your powerful heart.
So notice me, Horton...
--- HORTON ---
Oh, the world would be something new
--- GERTRUDE ---
Notice me, Horton
--- HORTON ---
If they noticed a thing or two...
--- GERTRUDE ---
Notice me, Horton
--- GERTRUDE, HORTON ---
The way I notice you.
--- Unknown ---
(The clock ticks as HORTON continues his clover search.
GERTRUDE finally exits in defeat. Time jumps to much later in his search.)
--- HORTON ---
Two million, nine hundred and ninety-nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine.
It's hopeless.
--- MAYZIE ---
You said it kid.
--- Unknown ---
(For a second, HORTON thinks he's heard the WHOS!)
--- HORTON ---
Who's there?
--- MAYZIE ---
It's me. Mayzie. Up here.
--- Unknown ---
(HORTON sees MAYZIE sitting on a huge, colorful egg, in a nest, in a tree)
--- HORTON ---
Mayzie .. Are you on a nest?
--- Unknown ---
MAYZIE (defensive)
Yeah. You wanna make something of it?
--- HORTON ---
No, I just never thought I'd see you on a nest
--- MAYZIE ---
Neither did I, Hort...neither did I.
