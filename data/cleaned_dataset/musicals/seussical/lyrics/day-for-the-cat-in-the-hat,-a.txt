------ Day For The Cat In The Hat, A ------
--- Cat ---
You're sad! Oh, dear!
Well luckily for you, the Cat is here!!
Think of a day that is rainy and gray and as dull as they come.
And there is nobody there and you're kickin' a chair and its oh so ho hum!
Nothin' to do and nobody but you, on a day that is flatter than flat.
Well, that is a day for the Cat in the Hat.
Think of a house that is small as a mouse and as neat as a pin.
Oh, its so tiny and clean, if you know what
I mean, and your folks are not in!
No one but you since a quarter to two and you've sat and you've sat and you've sat!
Oh, that is the time for the Cat in the Hat!
The Cat in the Hat in the Hat in the Hat in the Hat!

Think of a day that is rainy and gray and I'll show you some tricks!
'Cause there is no one but you and you're folks aren't due til a quarter past six!
Bounce on the brink of whatever you think and oh, what could be better than that?!

Jojo, Cat, and Helpers
And that is the fun of the Cat in the Hat!

(DANCE BREAK)
--- Cat and Helpers ---
You've got a mind that is one of a kind so why hide it away?!
It's time to open the locks and think out of the box and today is your day!
Bounce on the brink of whatever you think and oh, what could be better than that?
--- Jojo, Cat, and Helpers ---
And that is the fun of the Cat...
--- Cat and Helpers ---
...in the Hat!
