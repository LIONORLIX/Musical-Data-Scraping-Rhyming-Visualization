------ Military, The ------
--- SCHMITZ ---
The military academy
Is the place where he should be sent.
We'll drill the silliness from his head-
I'm sure we'll make a dent!
--- Unknown ---
We'll teach him fighting
And left and righting
Until he's muscled and tan!
A-hut-two-three!
He's pathetic!
A-hut-two-three!
Unathletic!
A-hut-two-three!
But I'm betting we can!
The military!
That's what makes a boy...
A man!

(CADETS enter)
--- CADETS ---
Schmitz, Schmitz, Schmitz, Schmitz,
Schmitz, Schmitz, Schmitz, Schmitz,
--- SCHMITZ ---
Look at these boys.
Why, you'd never know that just a few short months ago this one hummed in the shower!
This one couldn't color within the lines. And this one actually had an Opinion!
--- SCHMITZ ---
Our boys believe
In the right of every who
To eat their bread
Butter side up!
--- CADETS ---
Butter side up!
--- SCHMITZ ---
One thing we trust
On this fragile speck of dust
Is eating bread
Butter side up!
--- JOJO ---
Butter side up?
--- SCHMITZ ---
And as for those who like their butter down
--- CADETS ---
Down! Down! Down!
--- SCHMITZ, CADETS ---
We'll go to war
And run them out of town!
--- Unknown ---
(DANCE BREAK, in which the CADETS perform military exercises.
JOJO tries to imitate them with little success.)
--- CADETS ---
A-hut-two-three!
--- SCHMITZ ---
We enlist 'em.
--- CADETS ---
A-Hut-Two-Three
--- SCHMITZ ---
In our system.
And boys soon see
Nothing's easier than...
The military!
--- SCHMITZ CADETS ---
That's what makes a boy...
That's what makes a boy... That's what makes a boy ... That's what makes a boy...
A man!!! A man!!!
--- Unknown ---
(SCHMITZ starts a "marching call" and the CADETS begin to march off in line.
JOJO tries to keep up.)

9.1 THE MILITARY (PLAYOFF: GREEN EGGS AND HAM)
--- SCHMITZ ---
I do not like green eggs and ham!
--- CADETS ---
Do not like green eggs and ham!
--- SCHMITZ ---
I do not like them, Sam I am!
--- CADETS ---
Do not like them, Sam I am!
--- SCHMITZ ---
Sound off!
--- CADETS ---
Eggs and ham!
--- SCHMITZ ---
Sound off!
--- CADETS ---
Sam I am!
--- SCHMITZ & CADETS ---
I do not like green eggs...
And ham!
Schmitz, Schmitz, Schmitz, Schmitz...

(JOJO'S PARENTS are gone as the scene transitions to JOJO'S military school,
HE is now alone in his bunk bed.
