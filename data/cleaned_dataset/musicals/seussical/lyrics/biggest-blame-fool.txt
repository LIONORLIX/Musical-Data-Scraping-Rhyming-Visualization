------ Biggest Blame Fool ------
--- SOUR KANGAROO ---
Humpf! ... Humpfed a voice.
'Twas a sour kangaroo,
And the young kangaroo in her pouch said:
--- YOUNG KANGAROO ---
Humpf
--- SOUR KANGAROO ---
Too!
--- SOUR KANGAROO ---
Why that speck is as small as the head of a pin.
A person on that? Why there never has been!
You're the biggest blame fool in the Jungle of Nool
And I don't care who I tell. The biggest blame fool in the Jungle of Nool,
--- YOUNG KANGAROO ---
And I think so as well!
--- SOUR KANGAROO ---
Maybe I'm nasty, maybe I'm cruel
But you're the biggest blame fool
--- YOUNG KANGAROO ---
In the Jungle of Nool.
--- HORTON ---
It's true. Please believe me! I tell you sincerely
My ears are quite keen and I heard him quite clearly
I know there's a person down there. And what's more,
Quite likely there's two.
Even three.
Even four!

Discovered how truly unique Horton Was.
But she knew to approach him
Would probably fail,
'Cause who'd notice a bird
With a one feather tail?

Then the voice came again.
Calling over and over...

Who might be down on that clover.

Hello? Is anyone there?
