------ Alone In The Universe (Reprise) ------
--- HORTON ---
And now, little egg,
You're alone in the universe too.
Who would have thought you'd be left up to me,
A fool of an elephant up in a tree,
Well, this time, I swear I'll do better than try
I'll protect you from harm. Yes, I'll do it or die!
So rest now, young egg,
And I'll sing you a lullaby...
-----------------------------------------------------------------
--- HORTON ---
Do you hear what I hear? Do you see what I mean?
They made themselves heard though they still can't he seen!
--- GERTRUDE ---
They've proved they are persons, no matter how small.
--- HORTON ---
And their whole world was saved by the small- est of all!
--- Unknown ---
(THE SOUR KANGAROO has a change of heart and is slightly embarrassed)
--- SOUR KANGAROO ---
How true! Yes, how true! Said the sour kangaroo.
And, from now on, you know what I'm planning to do?
From now on, I'm going to protect them with you!
--- Unknown ---
And the young kangaroo in her pouch said...
--- SMALL KANGAROO ---
Me, too!
--- CAT ---
Their troubles were ended, they hailed his great..
--- ALL WHOS, CAT ---
Yopp!
--- CAT ---
And Jojo was honored as Thinker non-stop.
--- Unknown ---
(The WHOS carry him on their shoulders.)
--- MR. AND MRS. MAYOR ---
Now all Jojo's thinks would forever be heard.
--- CAT ---
Including this think...
--- Unknown ---
(We hear the sound of a giant egg cracking.
GERTRUDE dashes over to HORTON and they watch as THE EGG hatches.
We can only imagine what they're seeing by the wonder and joy on their faces.)
--- Unknown ---
JOJO, ALL (hushed wonder and amazement)
An elephant bird!
--- Unknown ---
HORTON (very moved)
Why he looks just like me. Except for the wings.
--- GERTRUDE ---
And except for the voice, 'cause that's how a bird sings.
--- Unknown ---
HORTON (slow mounting panic)
Gertrude, what will I do? I'm slow and I'm fat
All I know is the earth. He'll need much more than that!
--- Unknown ---
(A beat.)
--- Unknown ---
GERTRUDE (very tentative, very gentle)
I have wings.
Yes, I can fly.
You teach him earth
And I will teach him sky
--- HORTON ---
Just call my name
--- BOTH ---
And I'll see you through.
--- HORTON ---
One small voice in the universe
--- GERTRUDE ---
One true friend in the universe
--- Unknown ---
BOTH -
Who believes in you.
--- Unknown ---
(HORTON and GERTRUDE come together over the cradle,
looking down at their little elephant bird.)
--- CAT ---
The adventures were over.
The sky became...
--- JOJO ---
Pink.
--- CAT ---
And then, guess what happened?
--- Unknown ---
JOJO (to audience)
