------ How Lucky You Are (Mayzie's Reprise) ------
--- MAYZIE ---
Da da da da da da da...
--- Unknown ---
I was down in Fort Worth,
Just a girl on the wing,
When I met Tweet McFirth.
Oh, could that night owl sing!
Tell yourself
How lucky you are!
--- Unknown ---
CAT (AS PIANIST)
How lucky, how lucky you are-
--- MAYZIE ---
It was three weeks of bliss.
Then the usual segue:
He flew off to San Juan
Leaving me with his egg!
Tell yourself
How lucky you are!
--- Unknown ---
CAT (AS PIANIST)
How lucky you are!
--- MAYZIE ---
Now I'm bored and
I'm cranky and tired
Sitting day after day.
Who knew so much work was required?!
I'd much rather play!
I need a vacation!
I'm due for some rest-
Hey, Horton, would you maybe like to sit on my nest-?
--- HORTON ---
Why, Mayzie I couldn't. Of all silly things!
I haven't got feathers. I haven't got wings.
And not only that, but I'm here on a search.
I just couldn't leave my poor Whos in the lurch!
--- MAYZIE ---
I won't be gone long, kid. I give you my word.
I'll hurry right back, 'cause I'm that sort of bird!
Oh, Horton, I promise! I'll fly back real soon.
I'd only be gone for, say, one afternoon!
--- Unknown ---
(A beat, as HORTON considers this)
--- Unknown ---
HORTON (relenting)
Well, we all need vacations.
All right go on, take it
I'll sit on your egg
And I'll try not to break it
But please come back quickly-
One hour, maybe two.
I need to find Jojo.
I've got to save Who!
--- MAYZIE ---
Hit it cat!
--- Unknown ---
(The CAT strikes up an energetic Latin beat on the piano,
accompanying MAYZIE as she flies off, thrilled with her newfound freedom.)
--- Unknown ---
Thanks! Thanks a million! Toodle-oooo!
