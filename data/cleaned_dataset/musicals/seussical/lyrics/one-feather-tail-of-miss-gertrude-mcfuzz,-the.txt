------ One Feather Tail Of Miss Gertrude McFuzz, The ------
--- GERTRUDE ---
Doo doo, doo doo, doo doo, doo doo doo doo...
There once was a girl bird named Gertrude McFuzz
And she had the smallest plain tail ever was.
One droopy-droop feather, that's all that she had
And oh! That one feather made Gertrude so sad
--- Unknown ---
She curled it. She dyed it she gave it a puff
She decked it with flowers
But it wasn't enough.
For no matter what,
It just was what it was-
A tail that simply wasn't meant
To catch the eye of an elephant...
