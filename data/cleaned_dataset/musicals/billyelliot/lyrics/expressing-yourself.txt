Is it sinful if you're blue
To cheer up the place?
What is wrong with dressing up in satin and lace?
Get some earrings, some mascara, heels and a fan.
Pretty soon you will start to feel a different man.

If you manna be a dancer, dance
If you manna be a miner, mine
If you want to dress like somebody else,
Fine, fine, fine.

It's not a big statement, it's not a weird act
Just a good idea at the time
We'll not complain about your boring life
If you'll just leave mete mine.
If you wanna be a dancer, dance
If you wanna be a miner, mine

Everyone is different
It's the natural state
It's the facts, it's plain to see,
The world's grey enough without making it worse
