------ Deep Into The Ground ------
--- Unknown ---
Oh once I was a young man
Looked over vales and hills
Saw myself a future
of riches and of thrills
But on me fifteenth birthday
I paid my union dues
And they sent me deep into the ground
--- Unknown ---
Oh the winter wind can blow me colder
Oh the summer's heat can parch me dry
But I'll not leave here for a fortune
I shall never leave here till I die
--- Unknown ---
Oh once I had a family
Sons to make you proud
They have gone and left me now,
And I count the time out loud
For now I am an old man
Just waiting for my turn
Till they take me back into the ground
--- Unknown ---
Oh the winter wind can blow me colder
Oh the summer's heat can parch me dry
But I'll not leave here for a fortune
I shall never leave here till I die
--- Unknown ---
Oh the winter wind can blow me colder
Oh the summer's heat can parch me dry
But I'll love these dark, dark hills forever
And I won't leave them until I die
--- Unknown ---
Oh once I loved a woman
She meant all she world to me
Saw ourselves a future
As far as I could see
But I was only forty-seven
when they took her down from me
And buried her deep
--- Unknown ---
Oh the winter wind can blow me colder
Oh the summer's heat can parch me dry
But I'll love these dark, dark hills forever
