------ Stars Look Down ------
--- Unknown ---
Men -
Through the dark, and through the hunger,
through the night and through the fear.
Through the fight and years of hardship,
through the storms and through the tears.
--- Unknown ---
And although, your feet are weary,
and although your soul is worn,
and although they'll try to break you,
and although you'll feel alone.
--- Unknown ---
We will always, stand together, in the dark, right through the storm,
we will stand shoulder to shoulder, to keep us warm.
--- Unknown ---
Men and Women -
And the stars look down on the mean and hungry
and the stars look down and show the way.
And the stars look down and will stand together,
to see a day when then stars look down and know our history,
when the stars look down upon our past,
and the stars look down and see our future, bright at last.
--- Unknown ---
When we'll stand as one, beneath the sun.
--- Unknown ---
And though our hands are bruised and bleedin',
and our lungs are full with dust,
and our hearts are near to breakin' we will never, forgo the trust.
We will fight through pain and hunger, every arrow, every knife.
We will never give the hope up of a proud and honest life.
So we will always stand together, through the frost, the hail, the snow,
the stars are our redemption,and so we know.
--- Unknown ---
The stars look down when we're abandoned, look down in the heart of night.
And the stars look down and give us vision, to see the light.
The stars look down upon our struggle, the stars look down and know the past,
the stars look down and see our future bright at last.
--- Unknown ---
When we'll stand as one, beneath the sun.
--- Unknown ---
All out together, all out as one, all out for victory, til' we've won,
all out together, all out as one, all out for victory, all out til' we've won.
--- Unknown ---
Billy -
Take me up, and hold me gently. Raise me up, and hold me high.
Through the night, under darkness. Will come a day, when we will fly.
And although, we've been rejected. And although, we've been outcast.
We will find a new tomorrow, when we come to rest at last.
And we will stand there proudly, and we will never, walk alone.
And we, will be returned back to our home.
--- Unknown ---
And the stars look down at their reflection,
and the stars look down and there's a light
when the stars look down and see the justice, and the right.
And the stars look down and see the struggle,
and the stars look down at all the pain.
And the stars will lead to where light shines again.
Where we'll stand as one, beneath the sun. One, beneath the sun.
--- Unknown ---
One, beneath the stall.
Male Voices - When we stand as one
All out together
When we stand as one.
All out as one.
When we stand as one.
All out for victory
When we stand as one.
Til' we've won.
When we stand as one
All out together
When we stand as one.
All out as one.
When we stand as one.
All out for victory
When we stand as one.
Til' we've won.
When we stand as one
All out together
When we stand as one.
All out as one.
When we stand as one.
All out for victory
When we stand as one.
All out 'til we've won.
