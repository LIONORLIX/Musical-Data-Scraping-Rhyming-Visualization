------ Born to Boogie ------
--- Unknown ---
We weren't born to stand still
Ain't a question of will
Gotta move it's a fact
You were born to react
You weren't made to behave
Like you will in the grave.
--- Unknown ---
Where mu-sic is played
Oh the soul - will be swayed
And your feet they will move
As if on - ly to prove
That it was ?n't by chance
We were des - tined to dance.
--- Unknown ---
We were born to boogie,
We were born to boogie
It ain't a puzzle,
Cos we're blood and muscle
From the day of creation
We were the dance sensation.
Come on and shake per bootie
Cos we were born to boogie
Anyone can get it
Cos we're born kinetic
Come on and Mash Potat-a
The way God made pa.
--- Unknown ---
Your feet and your hands
Oh your toes and your glands
Your eyes and your chin
Your face and your skin
Oh your brawn and your brains
Your balls and your chains
--- Unknown ---
We were born to boogie,
We were born to boogie
It ain't a puzzle,
Coo we're blood and muscle
From the day of creation
We were the dance sensation.

Come on and ?Mash Potat-a?
The way God made ya.
--- Unknown ---
We were born to boogie
We're all born to
--- Unknown ---
We came up from the ocean
In full locomotion
And when we hit the ground
We just danced around
Because they say
It's in the DNA
--- Unknown ---
We were born to boogie
We were born to boogie
We were born to boogie
