------ Grandma's Song ------
--- Unknown ---
He was a complete basatard!
I hated the sod for thirty three year,
we should never have married of that i'm quite clear,
he spent the housekeeping money on whiskey and beer and never lifted a finger.
--- Unknown ---
times were hard,but the slime rolled back pissed,
so we'd fight and he'd swing and he rarely missed,
so i clobbered the sod when he couldn't resist, asleep you can't lift a finger,
--- Unknown ---
but we'd go dancing, and he'd hold me tight,
he was air, he was water, he was breath, he was light,
and he would hold me there with all his might and it was bliss for an hour or so,
but then they called time to go, and in the morning we were sober.
--- Unknown ---
oh he'd drink and he'd talk just like a fool,
lie like a bairn, snore like a mule,
rarely was sober pretty much was the rule and he never lifted a finger,
--- Unknown ---
i suppose times were hard,things were different then,
women were women and men, they were men,
seventeen, that was it,your life ended when you had a ring around your finger
--- Unknown ---
but we'd go dancing, he was my own brando,
and for a moment there my heart was aglow,
we had dust on our hair and nowhere to go,
but we were free for an hour or three,
from the people we had to be,
but in the morning, we were sober,
--- Unknown ---
but if i went through my time again oh i'd do without the help of men,
well at least your grandad but then again you know best not to linger,
--- Unknown ---
what is the use of dreaming now,
i had my chance well anyhow,
if i'd only know then what i know now,
i'd have given them all the finger.
--- Unknown ---
and gone dancing,
and not give a shit,
spin around and reel and love every bit,
and i'd dance alone and enjoy it, andi'd be me for and entire life,
instead of somebody's wife,
and i never would be sober.
