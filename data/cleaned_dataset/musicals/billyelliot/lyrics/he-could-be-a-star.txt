------ He Could Be a Star ------
--- DAD ---
I couldn't take it anymore son
It was tearing me apart
We're lost, we're finished man, we're through
I need to give the kid a future
I need to look him in the eye
Believe me son I'd do the same for you
--- TONY ---
But you can't give in now Dad
We've all been out a year
I can never talk to you again
You can't do this to me Dad
You can't do it to yourself
He's just a kid, he's only just a bairn
--- DAD ---
He could be a star for all we know
We don't know how far he can go
And no one else can give what I can give,
And no one else can give what I can give
He could go and he could shine
Not just stay here counting time,
Son we've got the chance to let him live,
Yes, we've got the chance to let him live
--- TONY ---
This isn't about us Dad
It's not about the kid
It's all of us, it's everybody's chance
It's everybody's future
It's everybody's past
It's not about a bairn who wants to dance
--- Unknown ---
It's about our history
It's about our rights
Think about the sacrifice we've made
It's what you always taught us since I was a lad
Please, Dad, don't let that passion fade
--- DAD ---
He could be a star for all we know
We don't know how far he can go
And no one else can give what I can give,
And no one else can give what I can give
--- MINERS ---
We're all in this together Jack
There is another way
All for one.
And one for all
Take this and this.
And this and this
And this and this
And this and this.
Don't worry, lad, we'll never let you fall.
--- DAD ---
He could be a star for all we know
We don't know how far he can go
--- TONY ---
But we'll give all that we can give
We'll all give all that we can give
--- MINERS ---
We will go and we will shine
We will go and seize the time
We will all have pride in how we live
We will all have pride in how we live
(Yes we'll all have pride in how we live
Yes we'll all have pride in how we live)
We will always stand together
Through the dark and through and through the storm
We will stand shoulder to shoulder
