------ Once We Were Kings ------
--- Unknown ---
Once we built visions on the ground we hewed
We dreamt of justice and of men renewed
All people equal, in all things
We once were heroes,
Once were kings
But all great things must come to pass
We know the first will soon be last
And in the ground we maybe lain
But a seed is sown to rise again
--- Unknown ---
So we walk proudly
And we walk strong
All together
We will go atone
The ground is empty
And cold as hell
But we all go together when we go
--- Unknown ---
We saw a land where wealth was shared
Each pain relieved, each hunger fed
Each man revered, each tyrant killed
Each soul redeemed, each life fulfilled
--- Unknown ---
From each mats means to each his need
We saw a time man would be freed
We fought for all the things we saw
The battle's lost but not the war
--- Unknown ---
So we walk proudly
And we walk strong
All together
We will go as one
The ground is empty
And cold as hell
But we all go together when we go
We will go down but our heads are proud
We will go down with our voices loud
We will go down but come again
And we all go together when we go
Ah... (3 times)
And we all go together when we go.
--- Unknown ---
We walk proudly, and we walk strong
All together we will go as one
The ground is empty, and cold as hell
But we all go together when we go.
--- Unknown ---
We walk proudly, and we walk strong
All together we will go as one
The ground is empty, and cold as hell
But we all go together when we go.
--- Unknown ---
We walk proudly, and we walk strong
All together we will go as one
The ground is empty, and cold as hell
