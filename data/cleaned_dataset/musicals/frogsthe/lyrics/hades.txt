------ Hades ------
--- DIONYSOS ---
Pluto! Uncle on my father's side. I am Dionysos.
--- PLUTO ---
Get out of town. Really?
--- DIONYSOS ---
Yes.
--- PLUTO ---
Well, well, well!
--- DIONYSOS ---
I must say, Herakles painted a rather intimidating picture of Hades.
--- PLUTO ---
Well, he's not exactly the brightest flame in the candelabra, is he? I assure you, the only thing you're in danger of here is never wanting to leave.
--- Unknown ---
Everybody dumps on Hades --
People yelling, Go to hell!
Well,
Let me tell you, life in Hades
Is just swell.
--- Five FLAME GIRLS appear ---
--- Unknown ---
It's got flash! It's got flair!
It's got spectacle to spare!
People come from everywhere,
Like it or not.
--- GIRLS ---
Mostly not.
--- PLUTO ---
Then they see what we've got --
--- GIRLS ---
What we've got
--- PLUTO ---
And they like it a lot.
--- GIRLS ---
Such a lot.
--- PLUTO ---
Hell is hot.
--- GIRLS ---
It's hot, so hot
--- PLUTO ---
I mean,
You never gain weight,
You're never out-of-date,
You never get balder, older,
You never have to fret about fate,
It's all too late.
I mean, you're dead.
--- GIRLS ---
Yes, you're dead...
--- PLUTO ---
You're not afraid of time rushing by.
Not afraid of oceans running dry,
All because you're not afraid to die,
Once you're dead.
--- GIRLS ---
[Humming the fanfare]
De de de de
De de de -- you're dead
--- PLUTO ---
And you get to live in Hades,
Where it's always 2 a.m.,
Where it's party till you drop
And never stop,
Because there's nothing we condemn.
--- Unknown ---
Where whatever you regret
You just forget
Or better yet,
Forgive.
Where you're not afraid to die,
And when you're not afraid to die,
Then you're not afraid to live.
And you're living here in Hades --
--- GIRLS ---
Oh ah...
--- PLUTO ---
-- And I mean you're living well.
--- GIRLS ---
Living well.
--- PLUTO ---
Everybody comes to Hades.
Everybody goes to hell.
--- GIRLS #1, #2, #3 ---
Up there, lots of sun,
--- GIRLS #4, #5 ---
Down here, fire and gloom.
--- PLUTO ---
Up there, not a lot of fun,
Down here va-va-voom!
--- GIRLS ---
Up there, gotta get a grip.
--- PLUTO ---
Down here, one long acid trip.
R.I.P. down here means, Let 'er rip!
--- GIRLS ---
Hell is hot,
Hell is happening,
--- PLUTO ---
Hell is cool!
--- GIRLS ---
Ah ah hell is cool!
--- PLUTO ---
Up there, that's just life.
Down here, this is living,
An endless party that no one's giving,
But everybody's invited.
--- Unknown ---
Once you settle down in Hades,
You can leave the world behind,
Here where everyone is gay --
No, not that way --
No, I mean gay --
Oh, never mind.
--- Unknown ---
Everyone's afraid of Hades,
So they never misbehave.
If they got a glimpse of Hades,
They'd be racing to the grave.
--- Music continues under ---
--- Unknown ---
In the grand scheme of things, life is a test really.
A little pop quiz. Nothing more.
Some pass, some fail. But it's ultimately meaningless.
Just something to amuse the gods. This is where reality begins.
--- Unknown ---
Here no one has a need any more
To commit a murder, wage a war.
Who're you going to murder, and what for?
They're all like dead.
--- ALL ---
Deceased,
Kaput, defunct, released...
--- PLUTO ---
And we're flying high in Hades,
Where it's always 2 a.m.,
Where it's party till you drop
And never stop,
Because there's nothing we condemn.
--- GIRLS ---
For the mortal human race
Who needs their space,
This is the place
To be.
--- PLUTO ---
'Cause you're not afraid of death,
And when you're not afraid of death,
Then you're ready for la vie!
--- GIRLS ---
Day is night when you're in Hades,
--- PLUTO ---
That's the thing that gives it zing...
--- GIRLS ---
How about a hand for Hades...
--- PLUTO ---
I just love being king!
--- GIRLS ---
Ahh...
--- ALL ---
