------ On the River Styx ------
--- DIONYSOS ---
I want to thank you, Xanthias.
--- XANTHIAS ---
For what?
--- DIONYSOS ---
For joining me on my quest.
--- XANTHIAS ---
I didn't have much of a choice, being a slave and all.
--- DIONYSOS ---
Still. There are particular times since my wife died when I feel -- so terribly alone.
--- XANTHIAS ---
I didn't know you were married.
--- DIONYSOS ---
It was many years ago. Her name was Ariadne.
Have you ever been in love, Xanthias?
--- XANTHIAS ---
Yeah, once. But there was someone else.
She was having an affair with a centaur.
You know -- half man, half horse? I couldn't compete with that.
