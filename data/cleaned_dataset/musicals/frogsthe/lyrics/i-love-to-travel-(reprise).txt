------ I Love to Travel (reprise) ------
--- DIONYSOS ---
Xanthias, bring the baggage.
We go straight to the River Styx. And no wending.
[Singing]
I love to travel --
--- XANTHIAS ---
Master, I hate to repeat myself, but --
--- DIONYSOS ---
Over verdant hillock --
--- XANTHIAS ---
I don't see why I have to go to Hades.
--- DIONYSOS ---
And through leafy woodland --
--- XANTHIAS ---
When my number is up, from natural causes, sure, but why now?
--- DIONYSOS ---
Beside leaping brook,
Along mossy lane --
--- XANTHIAS ---
I have hopes, dreams -- I wanna see Paris.
I wanna have a m?nage ? trois. Is that pastry?
--- DIONYSOS ---
Through vale and valley --
--- XANTHIAS ---
I like earth.
--- DIONYSOS ---
Ascending craggy rock,
Descending deep ravine --
--- XANTHIAS ---
I've lived here since I was born.
--- DIONYSOS ---
Exploring shady glade
And making merry with the wood nymphs --
--- We hear small high-pitched laughter ---
--- Unknown ---
I was raised by wood nymphs!
--- XANTHIAS ---
That explains a lot.
--- DIONYSOS ---
Who finally point us in the right direction.
--- XANTHIAS ---
We were going in the wrong direction?!
--- DIONYSOS ---
And now we travel
Due south.
Along stony path,
Across deep depression --
--- XANTHIAS ---
I'm in a deep depression.
--- DIONYSOS ---
Until it's time to shimmy straight down!
--- Unknown ---
I love to travel
I love to travel
I love to --
--- Speaking ---
Good news. We've made it to the River Styx -- look.
