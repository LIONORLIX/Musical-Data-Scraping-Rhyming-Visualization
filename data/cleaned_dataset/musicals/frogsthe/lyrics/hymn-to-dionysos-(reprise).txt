------ Hymn to Dionysos (reprise) ------
--- SHAKESPEARE ---
[to PLUTO]
Farewell, my liege. Now no way can I stray save back to earth.
[to DIONYSOS]
I pray you lead the way.
--- ARIADNE ---
Dionysos
Dionysos
Dionysos
Bring the sound of poets
In a blaze of words to a heedless earth,
Evoe!
--- Unknown ---
Alalai! Alalai!
Evoe!
Alalalalalalai!
--- DIONYSIANS ---
Dionysos,
Bring the taste of wisdom
In a feast of words to a hungry earth.
--- Unknown ---
Evoe!
Alalai! Alalai!
Evoe!
Alalalalalalai!
--- Unknown ---
Dionysos,
Bring the taste of words,
Bring the sounds of wit,
Bring a sense of purpose,
Bring the feel of passion,
Bring the glow of thought
To a darkening earth.
Evoe!
Alalai! Alalai!
Evoe!
Alalalalalalalalai!
--- Unknown ---
Evoe!
Alalai! Alalai!
Evoe!
Alalalalalalai!
--- DIONYSOS ---
The frogs are quiet tonight.
--- CHARON ---
Maybe you scared them off.
--- DIONYSOS ---
I doubt that.
--- Unknown ---
[The boat lands. SHAKESPEARE steps out,
followed by DIONYSOS -- who is stopped by CHARON.]
--- CHARON ---
Say, isn't that William Shakespeare?
--- DIONYSOS ---
Why yes, it is.
--- CHARON ---
The ride's on me.
--- DIONYSOS ---
Thank you, Charon.
--- Unknown ---
[DIONYSOS and SHAKESPEARE disembark and the boat pulls away as the curtain closes.
The stage is bright. DIONYSOS spots the Audience and points them out to SHAKESPEARE.
SHAKESPEARE bows.]
--- DIONYSOS ---
[Whispering]
Say something.
--- SHAKESPEARE ---
Taffeta phrases, silken terms precise, three-piled hyperbole?
--- DIONYSOS ---
Well...
--- SHAKESPEARE ---
Remember, sir, words are not deeds.
--- DIONYSOS ---
Yet do they ease the heart.
--- SHAKESPEARE ---
Aye sir, yet a new beginning calls for a new play.
The weight of this sad time we must obey.
Speak what we feel, not what we ought to say.
--- DIONYSOS ---
Yes, speak what we feel.
[To the Audience]
Dare I say it -- what have we learned?
We must participate or prepare to be burned.
Frogs will be frogs and life's for the living.
Man must use his brain or there'll be much misgiving.
I've taken a chance, I've brought back a poet.
