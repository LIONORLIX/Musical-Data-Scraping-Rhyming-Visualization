------ We Are Off On a Great Mission ------
--- DIONYSOS ---
Xanthias, it is time to start our journey. We are off on a great mission.
--- XANTHIAS ---
Where?
--- DIONYSOS ---
I, Dionysos, god of drama, am going to travel
to the Underworld and bring back a great writer who can speak
to the problems of our society and give us comfort, wit and wisdom.
And also challenge our complacencies.
--- XANTHIAS ---
Who are you gonna bring back?
--- DIONYSOS ---
Shaw.
--- XANTHIAS ---
Oh... who?
--- DIONYSOS ---
George -- Bernard -- Shaw.
--- XANTHIAS ---
The one who wrote the plays?
--- DIONYSOS ---
Yes, the one who wrote the plays. And what glorious plays!
--- XANTHIAS ---
I can't think of any at the moment.
--- DIONYSOS ---
I know them all.
--- XANTHIAS ---
Did he write The Rape of the Sabine Women? I liked that -- it had a lot of pictures.
--- DIONYSOS ---
