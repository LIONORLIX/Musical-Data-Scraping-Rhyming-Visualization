What a gyp-
This I such a rip-off
Every time she sneers at me
I want to rip her upper lip off
But this is not a healthy way to live
I've gotta be more. . .positive
--- Unknown ---
The good news is
She doesn't own a shotgun so I guess I got off cheap
The bad news is tonight I'm counting squatters
When I should be counting sheep
The good news is I'm here in New York where solvency
May await
The bad news is the good news ain't so great
--- Unknown ---
Sure I'm tired, depressed and pissed
I'll pretend to be an optimist
--- Unknown ---
The good news is I'm sharing this apartment with a pair
Of single chicks
The bad news is that one of them is rabid and the
Other's three foot six
--- Unknown ---
Paula
--- Unknown ---
The good news is we're safe in my bed not out on
The street, knock wood
The bad news is he could be here for good
--- Unknown ---
Paula & Eliott
--- Unknown ---
The good news is some quick negotiation
Kept the roof above my head
The bad news is a homicidal maniac
Is ten feet from my bed
--- Unknown ---
Lucy
--- Unknown ---
The bad news is we're stuck with a roommate
This one is a ticking bomb
The good news is-
This time I'm the one who sleeps with mom!
--- Unknown ---
All
--- Unknown ---
The bad news is that I haven't slept a wink
And it's almost dawn
The good news is
Maybe I'll wake up and

Elliot
--- Unknown ---
She'll be
--- Unknown ---
Paula & Lucy
--- Unknown ---
He'll be
--- Unknown ---
All
--- Unknown ---
Gone
Why this?
Why me?
