------ Paula (An Improvised Love Song) ------
--- Unknown ---
Paula
--- Unknown ---
Who would've thought
This subhuman sublet
With an ego the size
Of the national debt
Would live up to his hype
But he isn't my type
--- Unknown ---
Elliot
--- Unknown ---
Who would've thought
I'd subdue and disarm
Her disdain and contempt
With the force of my charm
She'd resist if she could
I must really be good
--- Unknown ---
Paula & Elliot
--- Unknown ---
Why couldn't I see it coming?
Why didn't I have a clue?
I suddenly fell like humming
--- Unknown ---
Paula
--- Unknown ---
And I must put a stop to this soon
--- Unknown ---
Elliot
--- Unknown ---
I can feel that she's changing her tune
--- Unknown ---
Paula
--- Unknown ---
Who would believe
I'm enough of a fool
To be taking the plunge
After draining the pool
We may learn to be friends
But that's right where it ends
--- Unknown ---
Paula & Elliot
--- Unknown ---
All that I know
Is that just down the hall
In the very next room
Through this paper-thin wall
There's a creature I hated
I can't wait to wake up and see
Who would have thought that
--- Unknown ---
Paula
--- Unknown ---
This nightmare
--- Unknown ---
Elliot
--- Unknown ---
This wonderful blunder
--- Unknown ---
Paula & Elliot
--- Unknown ---
Would happen to me
Who would have thought?
--- Unknown ---
Lucy & Cynthia
--- Unknown ---
Who would have thought it
Would take them so long
--- Unknown ---
Cynthia
--- Unknown ---
I was sure of last week
--- Unknown ---
Lucy
--- Unknown ---
And last weekend was wrong
--- Unknown ---
Melanie
--- Unknown ---
This is totally cool
--- Unknown ---
Lucy & Cynthia
--- Unknown ---
That's cause you won the pool
--- Unknown ---
Melanie
--- Unknown ---
When do you think
They will cut to the chase
--- Unknown ---
Lucy
--- Unknown ---
Well, his odds have improved
--- Unknown ---
Cynthia
--- Unknown ---
Since he got to first base
--- Unknown ---
Three girls
--- Unknown ---
And he's coming on strong
So it shouldn't be long
This couldn't be more outstanding
We hang on their every move
--- Unknown ---
Melanie
--- Unknown ---
It's very much like "Knots Landing"
--- Unknown ---
Cynthia & Melanie
--- Unknown ---
Will he charm her right into his palm?
--- Unknown ---
Lucy
--- Unknown ---
If he doesn't she isn't my mom
--- Unknown ---
Three girls
--- Unknown ---
What happens next
Could be anyone's call
--- Unknown ---
Cynthia & Melanie
--- Unknown ---
We're depending on you
With your ear to the wall
--- Unknown ---
Three girls
--- Unknown ---
To turn into a spy to be of those sly little elves
Till we're grown, on your own, and are prone to find
Romance
Ourselves
Who would've thought?
