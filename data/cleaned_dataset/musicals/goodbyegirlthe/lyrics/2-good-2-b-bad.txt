------ 2 Good 2 B Bad ------
--- Unknown ---
Mrs. Crosby
--- Unknown ---
As a dancing French fry
Your mom's a pretty hot tomato
But get up off that sofa girl
Before you turn into a hot potato
--- Unknown ---
Put down that remote control
Hit the books-no rock and roll
Real life is nothing like Cosby
So move it or else Mrs. Crosby gets mad
Do your homework
You're too good to be bad
--- Unknown ---
You have had too much TV
Mom's not half as strict as me
I know your arm may need twisting
But don't even think of resisting a tad
It's a school night
You're too good to be bad
--- Unknown ---
Drop that phone and don't start yackin'
I wanna hear those books start crackin'
A genie granted me three wishes
Get to your math and history and then do the dishes
--- Unknown ---
Please, don't make me turn to force
You are left with no recourse
Land in the slammer or end up a grammar school grad
You're really awfully hap'nin' for an anglo-saxon
So take a tip from Mrs. C and Michael Jackson
Just don't dis me
