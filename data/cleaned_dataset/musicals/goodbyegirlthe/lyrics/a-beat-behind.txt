------ A Beat Behind ------

(1, 2, 3, 4, lift those legs up)
Higher, it's time to perspire
I wanna know where your fire is
Harder; now show me some ardor
Before you retire from the biz

Paula
--- Unknown ---
Thirty-five
And I can't go the distance
I'm a beat behind
Half alive
Seems my whole damned existence
Is a beat behind
I'm gone to seed
And in need
Of condemning
I've got the drive
To survive of a lemming
Time made me obsolete
And a beat behind
--- Unknown ---
Instructor
--- Unknown ---
Push it class
Cause it gets tougher
Paula, you're a beat behind
Arms apart
For your art, suffer
Paula, move your sweet behind
Stop looking glum
Overcome my inertia
Some season soon
Tommy Tune
May rehearse ya
He'll keep you on your feet
Till you lose your mind
You're a beat behind

Paula, what happened to Paula?
So sad to see Paula fall apart
--- Unknown ---
Paula
--- Unknown ---
Out of breath
Out of shape
And exactly as I thought,
Behind.
Look at her
With the lungs of Madonna
And a taut behind
Somebody
Get me an anti-depressant
She's at the post
Maybe post-adolescent
Time can be so unkind
I'm a beat behind
This is so perverse
Better call a nurse
Better yet a hearse.
--- Unknown ---
I thought I'd bounce right back
A job would fall in place
But what is so appalling is
I'm falling on my face
Well, at least I've got a roof above my head
But if I must die, I'd rather die in bed.
--- Unknown ---
Some one
Wake me
I am in a
Nightmare
I've got
No stamina
--- Unknown ---
Class
--- Unknown ---
Sweat till your sleek at the peak of condition
They're doing shows now with no intermission
--- Unknown ---
Everyone
--- Unknown ---
Step it up
Play the part
Show your stuff
And let your
Heart rate climb
Pour it on
Let 'em know that
Your body's workin'
O-ver time
No time to rest time to test your endurance
--- Unknown ---
Paula
--- Unknown ---
Laid-up, in pain, but with paid up ensurance
--- Unknown ---
Everyone
--- Unknown ---
Dance like Astaire, with un-erring precision
Brain cells employed to avoid a collision
--- Unknown ---
Paula
--- Unknown ---
I've got a flat; rent controlled, and a daughter
I'd trade them both for a teaspoon of water
--- Unknown ---
Everyone
--- Unknown ---
Back to the Broadway grind
