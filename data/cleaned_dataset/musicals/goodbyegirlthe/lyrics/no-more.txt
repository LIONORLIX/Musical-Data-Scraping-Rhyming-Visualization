Paula
--- Unknown ---
My built-in female radar only zeroes-in on zeroes
I'm like the actors' fund supporting wanna be Deniros
--- Unknown ---
I've been caught in a trap
But it's not gonna happen again
--- Unknown ---
No more
Racing toward a heartache
Seeking disappointment
Chasing after dreams
I've trusted more than enough to last me till I die
Love's as unreliable as it seems
No more
Living for another
Craving his approval
Giving to extremes
I'm through collecting broken promises
I've heard them all before
I know more now
--- Unknown ---
In my experience with men I've spent a lifetime proving
You know a man is lying when you see his lips start moving
My women's intuition ought to be recalled
Or overhauled
--- Unknown ---
Most men have backbones like a strand of overcooked
Linguini
You say commitment and they instantly become Houdini
When I look back upon the men I've loved I'm thoroughly
Appalled
--- Unknown ---
I'm gonna build a wall around my heart
A towering fortress made of solid rock
Electric fences all around my heart
The next guy who hits on me
Is in for a shock
--- Unknown ---
I know to let go now
And so I solemnly promise
--- Unknown ---
No more!
--- Unknown ---
Seeking disappointments
Chasing after dreams
With just the two of us now
We're better off by far
You and I are one of the greatest teams
No more
Living for a lover
Craving his approval
Giving to extremes
They say that history repeats itself
I'll build my past goodbye
No more
No more
