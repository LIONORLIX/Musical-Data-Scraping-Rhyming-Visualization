Sometimes even mothers make mistakes
And I've made my share
Though I swear I've tried to be the best I can be
But sometimes I forget that you are always there
Like a video camera
Always watching me
--- Unknown ---
Think about your ever-loving mother as a
Luminous example
Just cause I've an appetite for heartache doesn't mean
You need a sample
I'm counting on you to exercise good solid judgement
Totally different from mine
Don't follow in my footsteps
And you're gonna be fine
--- Unknown ---
Lucy
--- Unknown ---
You want me to watch you ev'ry movement and the expect
Me to ignore you
--- Unknown ---
Paula
--- Unknown ---
You can go and make your own mistakes or you can let
Me make them for you
Whenever you see me go down in flames ask the question
Why put my hand in the fire?
Don't follow in my footsteps
--- Unknown ---
Lucy & Paula

These are words to inspire

Paula
--- Unknown ---
Do as I say not as I do
Just to spare the lion's share of what I've been through
Just remember everything that I did wrong
I did it all wrong for you

Lucy

How would you react if I decided to grow up to be a
Dancer?

I would prob'bly ground you till you're fifty while
I thought about the answer

Lucy

I wanna make my life on the stage just like you did
--- Unknown ---
Paula
--- Unknown ---
Find an original sin
Don't pick up any dance steps
Don't pick up any actors
Don't follow in my footsteps
That's a place to begin
--- Unknown ---
Now and then you've caught me with a cigarette
While wheezing hard and choking
--- Unknown ---
Lucy
--- Unknown ---
Mom, I got the message
That's why I decided to quit smoking
Whenever I'm in a moment
Of doubt, I remember
Mom's an infallible guide
Don't follow in her footsteps
--- Unknown ---
Paula
--- Unknown ---
And you'll fill me with pride
--- Unknown ---
Lucy

Moms have got it rough but if you really want a
Challenge
Be a daughter

It's about as hard as walking on or
Breathing under water
