If someone stood up in a crowd
And raised his voice up way out loud
And waved his arm and shook his leg
You'd notice him
--- Unknown ---
If someone in the movie show
Yelled Fire in the second row
This whole place is a powder keg!
You'd notice him
--- Unknown ---
And even without clucking like a hen
Everyone gets noticed, now and then,
Unless, of course, that personage should be
Invisible, inconsequential me!
--- Unknown ---
Cellophane
Mister Cellophane
Shoulda been my name
Mister Cellophane
'Cause you can look right through me
Walk right by me
And never know I'm there...
--- Unknown ---
I tell ya
Cellophane
Mister Cellophane
Shoulda been my name
Mister Cellophane
'Cause you can look right through me
Walk right by me
And never know I'm there...
--- Unknown ---
Suppose you was a little cat
Residin' in a person's flat
Who fed you fish and scratched your ears?
You'd notice him
--- Unknown ---
Suppose you was a woman, wed
And sleepin' in a double bed
Beside one man, for seven years
You'd notice him
--- Unknown ---
A human being's made of more than air
With all that bulk, you're bound to see him there
Unless that human bein' next to you
Is unimpressive, undistinguished
You know who...
--- Unknown ---
Cellophane
Mister Cellophane
Shoulda been my name
Mister Cellophane
'Cause you can look right through me
Walk right by me
And never know I'm there...
I tell ya
Cellophane
Mister Cellophane
Shoulda been my name
Mister Cellophane
'Cause you can look right through me
Walk right by me
And never know I'm there
Never even know I'm there.
