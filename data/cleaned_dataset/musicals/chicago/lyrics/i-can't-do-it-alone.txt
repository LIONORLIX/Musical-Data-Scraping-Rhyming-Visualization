------ I Can't Do It Alone ------
--- Velma ---
My sister and I had an act that couldn't flop
My sister and I were headed straight for the top
My sister and I eared a thou a week at least
But my sister is now, unfortunately, deceased
--- Unknown ---
Oh, I know, it's sad, of course,
But a fact is still a fact
And now all that remains
Is the remains
Of a perfect double act!
--- Unknown ---
Roxie, do you know you are exactly the same size as my sister?
Oh, you would fit in her wardrobe perfectly. Look, why don't I
just show you some of the act, huh?
Watch this.
Now, you have to imagine this with two people.
It's swell with two people.
--- Unknown ---
First I'd....(Drums!)
Then she'd...(Saxophone!)
Then we'd...(Together!)
But I can't do it alone!
Then she'd...
Then I'd...
Then we'd...
But I can't do it alone!
--- Unknown ---
She'd say, "What's your sister like?"
I'd say, MEN,
Yuk, yuk, yuk
She'd say, you're the cat's meow
Then we'd wow
The crowd again
When she'd go...
I'd go...
We'd go...
--- Unknown ---
And then those ding-dong daddies started to roar
Whistled, stomped, and stamped on the floor
Yelling, screaming, begging for more.
--- Unknown ---
And we'd say, "O.K. fellas, keep your socks up.
You ain't seen nothing yet!
--- Unknown ---
(She dances.)
Ah, aha, yeah!
But I simply cannot do it alone.
--- Unknown ---
Well? What did ya think? Come on, you can say.
--- Velma ---
O.K. O.K. The first part can always be rewritten. But the
second part was really nifty. Watch this!
--- Unknown ---
Then she'd...(See, get it, right?)
Then I'd...(Then I kick really high...)
Then we'd...
But I can't do it alone!
She'd say, What state's Chicago in?
I'd say, ILL!
Did ya get that?
She'd say, turn your motor off!
I can hear 'em cheerin' still
When she'd go...
I'd go...
We'd go...(Sideways!)
And then those two-bit Johnnies did it up brow
To cheer the best attraction in town
They really tore the balcony down
--- Unknown ---
And we'd say, "O.K. fellas, O.K., we're goin' home, but
here's a few more partin' shots! And this...this we did
in perfect unison.
Cymbals crash crash crash
Now, you've seen me goin' through it
You can see there's nothin' to it
But I simply cannot do it
Alone!
