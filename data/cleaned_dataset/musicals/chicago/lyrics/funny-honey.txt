--- ANNOUNCER ---
For her first number, Miss Roxie Hart would like to sing a song
of love and devotion dedicated to her dear husband Amos.
--- FUNNY HONEY ---
Roxie:
Sometimes I'm right
Sometimes I'm wrong
But he doesn't care
He'll string along
He loves me so
That funny honey of mine!
--- Unknown ---
Sometimes I'm down
Sometimes I'm up
But he follows 'round
Like some droopy-eyed pup
He loves me so
That funny honey of mine!
--- Unknown ---
He ain't no sheik
That's no great physique
Lord knows he ain't got the smarts
--- Unknown ---
Oh, but look at that soul
I tell you, that whole
Is a whole lot greater
Than the sum of his parts
--- Unknown ---
And if you knew him like me
I know you'd agree
What if the world
Slander my name?
Why, he'd be right there
Taking the blame
--- Unknown ---
He loves me so
And it all suits me fine
That funny, sunny, honey
Hubby of mine!
--- Amos ---
A man's got the right to protect his home and his loved ones, right?
Fogarty:
Of course, he has!
Amos:
Well, I come in from the garage, Officer, and I see him coming
through the window. With my wife Roxanne there, sleepin'...
Like an angel...
--- Roxie: Amos ---
He loves me so ...an angel!
That funny honey of mine!
--- Amos ---
I mean supposin', just supposin', he had violated her or somethin'...you
know what I mean...violated?
--- Fogarty ---
I know what you mean...
Amos:
...or somethin'. Think how terrible that would have been. It's a good
thing I came home from work on time, I'm tellin' ya that! I say I'm
tellin' ya that!
--- Roxie ---
He loves me so
That funny honey of mine!
--- Fogarty ---
Name of deceased...Fred Casely.
Amos:
Fred Casely. How could he be a burglar? My wife knows him!
He sold us our furniture!
--- Roxie ---
Lord knows he ain't got the smarts
--- Amos ---
She lied to me. She told me he was a burglar.
Fogarty:
You mean he was dead when you got home?
Amos:
She had him covered with a sheet and she's givin' me that cock
and a bull story about this burglar, and I ought to say I did
it 'cause I was sure to get off. Burglar, huh!
--- Roxie: Amos ---
Now, he shot off his trap And I believed her!
That cheap little tramp. So, she
I can't stand that sap was two-timing me, huh?
Well, then, she can just
swing for all I care.
Look at him go Boy, I'm down at the garage,
Rattin' on me working my butt off fourteen
With just one more brain hours a day and she's up there
What half-wit he'd be munchin' on God-damn bon-bons
and jazzing. This time she
If they string me up pushed me too far.
I'll know who That little chiseler.
Brought the twine Boy, what a sap I was!
