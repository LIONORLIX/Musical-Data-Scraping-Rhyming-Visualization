------ Little Bit of Good ------
--- Mary Sunshine ---
When I was a tiny tot
Of maybe two or three
I can still remember what
My mother said to me...
--- Unknown ---
Place rose colored glasses on your nose
And you will see the robins
Not the crows
--- Unknown ---
For in the tense and tangled web
Our weary lives can weave
You're so much better off
If you believe...
--- Unknown ---
That there's a little bit of good
In everyone
In everyone you'll ever know
--- Unknown ---
Yes, there's a little bit of good
In everyone
Though many times, it doesn't show
--- Unknown ---
It only takes a taking time
With one another
For under every mean veneer
Is someone warm and dear
Keep looking...
--- Unknown ---
For that bit of good in everyone
The ones you call bad
Are never all bad
So try to find that little bit of good
--- Unknown ---
Just a little, little bit of good
--- Unknown ---
Is someone warm and dear
Keep looking...
--- Unknown ---
For that little good in everyone
Although you meet rats
They're not complete rats
So try to find that little bit of good!

Mr. Flynn, the reporters are here.
Billy:
Let 'em in, Butch. Okay, Roxie, act like a dummy; you sit
on my lap and do all the talking.
