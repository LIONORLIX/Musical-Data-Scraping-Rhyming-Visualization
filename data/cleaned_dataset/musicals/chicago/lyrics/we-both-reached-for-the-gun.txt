Very wealthy.

But she was granted one more start

The convent of the sacred heart!
--- Reporters ---
When'd you get there?
--- Billy (as Roxie) ---
1920
--- Reporters ---
How old were you?
--- Billy (as Roxie) ---
Don't remember
--- Reporters ---
Then what happened?
--- Billy (as Roxie) ---
I met Amos
And he stole my hear away
Convinced me to elope one day
--- Mary Sunshine ---
A convent girl! A run-away marriage! Oh, it's too terrible.
You poor, poor dear.
--- Reporters ---
Who's Fred Casely?
--- Billy (as Roxie) ---
My ex-boy friend.
--- Reporters ---
Why'd you shoot him.
--- Billy (as Roxie) ---
I was leavin'.
--- Reporters ---
Was he angry?
--- Billy (as Roxie) ---
Like a madman!
Still I said, Fred, move along.
--- Billy ---
She knew that she was doin' wrong
--- Reporters ---
Then describe it
--- Billy (as Roxie) ---
He came toward me.
--- Reporters ---
With a pistol?
--- Billy (as Roxie) ---
From my bureau
--- Reporters ---
Did you fight him?
--- Billy (as Roxie) ---
Like a tiger
--- Billy ---
He had strength and she had none
--- Billy (as Roxie) ---
And yet we both reached for the gun
Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes we both
Oh yes, we both
Oh yes, we both reached for
The gun, the gun, the gun, the gun
Oh yes, we both reached for the gun
For the gun.
--- Billy and Reporters ---
Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes they both
Oh yes, they both
Oh yes, they both reached for
The gun, the gun, the gun, the gun
Oh yes, they both reached for the gun
For the gun.
--- Billy ---
Understandable, understandable
Yes, it's perfectly understandable
Comprehensible, comprehensible
Not a bit reprehensible
It's so defensible!
--- Reporters ---
How you're feeling?
--- Billy (as Roxie) ---
Very frightened
--- Reporters ---
Are you sorry?
--- Roxie ---
Are you kidding?
--- Reporters ---
What's your statement?
--- Billy (as Roxie) ---
All I'd say is
Though my choo-choo jumped my track
I'd give my life to bring him back
--- Reporters ---
And?
--- Billy (as Roxie) ---
Stay away from
--- Reporters ---
What?
--- Billy (as Roxie) ---
Jazz and liquor
--- Reporters ---
And?
--- Billy (as Roxie) ---
And the man who
--- Reporters ---
What?
--- Billy (as Roxie) ---
Play for fun
--- Reporters ---
And what?
--- Billy (as Roxie) ---
That's the thought that
--- Reporters ---
Yeah!
--- Billy (as Roxie) ---
Came upon me
--- Reporters ---
When?
--- Billy (as Roxie) ---
When we both reached for the gun!
--- Mary Sunshine ---
Understandable, understandable
--- Billy and Mary Sunshine ---
Yes, it's perfectly understandable
Comprehensible, comprehensible
Not a bit reprehensible
It's so defensible!
--- Billy: Reporters ---
Let me Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes they both
Hear it! Oh yes, they both
Oh yes, they both reached for
The gun, the gun, the gun,
The gun
Oh yes, they both reached
For the gun
A little louder! For the gun.
Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes they both
Oh yes, they both
Oh yes, they both reached
For the gun, the gun,
Now you got it! The gun, the gun
Oh yes, they both reached
For the gun
For the gun.
--- Billy and reporters ---
Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes they both
Oh yes, they both
Oh yes, they both reached for
The gun, the gun, the gun, the gun
Oh yes, they both reached for the gun.

Oh yes, they both reached for
The gun, the gun, the gun, the gun,
The gun, the gun, the gun, the gun,
The gun, the gun, the gun, the gun,
The gun, the gun, the gun, the gun.

Both reached for the...gun

The gun, the gun, the gun, the gun
The gun, the gun, the gun, the gun
