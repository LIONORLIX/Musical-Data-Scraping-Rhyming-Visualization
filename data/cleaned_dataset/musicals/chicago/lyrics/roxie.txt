The name on everybody's lips
Is gonna be Roxie
The lady rakin' in the chips
Is gonna be Roxie

I'm gonna be a celebrity
That means somebody everyone knows
They're gonna recognize my eyes
My hair, my teeth, my boobs, my nose

And who in case she doesn't hang
Can say she started with a bang?

And now that I'm a celebrity, I'm gonna have me a swell act,

me up, show me off - Oh, hell, I'll get two boys. It'll frame
me better. Think Big, Roxie, think Big. I'm gonna get me
a whole bunch of boys.
