The whole world's gone low-brow. Things ain't what they used to be.
--- Velma ---
They sure ain't, Mama. They sure ain't. It's all gone.

Whatever happened to fair dealing?
And pure ethics
And nice manners?
Why is it everyone now is a pain in the ass?
Whatever happened to class?
--- Matron ---
Class.
Whatever happened to, Please, may I?
And Yes, thank you?
And How charming?
Now, every son of a bitch is a snake in the grass
Whatever happened to class?
--- Velma and Matron ---
Class!
Ah, there ain't no gentlemen
To open up the doors
There ain't no ladies now,
There's only pigs and whores
And even kids'll knock ya down
So's they can pass
Nobody's got no class!
--- Velma ---
Whatever happened to old values?
--- Matron ---
And fine morals?
--- Velma ---
And good breeding?

Matron
Now, no one even says oops when they're
Passing their gas
Whatever happened to class?
--- Velma ---
Class
--- Velma and Matron ---
Ah, there ain't no gentlemen
That's fit for any use
And any girl'd touch your privates
For a deuce
--- Matron ---
And even kids'll kick your shins and give you sass
--- Velma ---
And even kids'll kick your shins and give you sass
--- Velma and Matron ---
Nobody's got no class!
--- Velma ---
All you read about today is rape and theft
--- Matron ---
Jesus Christ, ain't there no decency left?
--- Velma and Matron ---
Nobody's got no class
--- Matron ---
Everybody you watch
--- Velma ---
'S got his brains in his crotch
--- Matron ---
Holy crap
--- Velma ---
Holy crap
--- Matron ---
What a shame
--- Velma ---
What a shame
