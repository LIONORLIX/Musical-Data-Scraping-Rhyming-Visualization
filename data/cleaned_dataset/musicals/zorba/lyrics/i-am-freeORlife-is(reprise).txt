------ I Am Free/Life Is(Reprise) ------
--- Unknown ---
I have nothing. I want nothing.
I am free!
I need nothing. I owe nothing!
I am free!
--- Unknown ---
If my feet say, “Come this way!”
I probably would,
But if they say,
“Go that way!” that way is just as good.
--- Unknown ---
I ask nothing.
I judge nothing.
I am free!
--- Unknown ---
There is one Zorba, and that Zorba
I must be!
--- Unknown ---
Heaven waits for other men, but not for me!
I fear nothing! I hope for nothing!
I am free!
--- Unknown ---
Hey Boss, you wanna hear a story?
Yes.
You do? Then I’ll tell you.
--- Unknown ---
One morning in Salonika, I never will forget,
I was passing by the oldest man I think I ever met.
He was kneeling in an orchard,
When he turned and looked at me,
And he said, “Come watch me,
Sonny, as I plant this almond tree!”
I tell you, Boss, that fellow, he was over 95,
And I think he had a week,
Or maybe two to stay alive,
But he had to plant that almond tree,
And when I asked him why,
He said,
“I live every minute as if I would never die.”
--- Unknown ---
Think of that, Boss!
He lived as if he would never die.
I live as if I would die any minute!
For that reason… just that reason,
--- Unknown ---
I am free!
I see somewhere, I go somewhere!
I am free!
--- Unknown ---
Think of that whenever you remember me!
I fear nothing!
I hope for nothing!
I am free!

My boat doesn’t leave for an hour…
I’ll walk a ways with you.
No, no, let’s do it quick, here and now,
Like men cut short smoking, wine, or a love affair.
Come! Embrace Zorba!
--- Unknown ---
Life is what you do while you’re waiting to die,
Life is how the time goes by!
--- Unknown ---
Having if lucky, wanting if not,
Looking for the ruby underneath the rot,
Hungry for the pilaf in someone else’s pot,
But that’s the only choice you’ve got!
--- Unknown ---
Life is what you do while you’re waiting to die,
Life is how the time goes by!
