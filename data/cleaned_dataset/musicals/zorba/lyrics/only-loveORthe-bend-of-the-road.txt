------ Only Love/The Bend of the Road ------
--- Unknown ---
To be loved again
To be not alone,
Oh, Mr. Niko,
Do you know what that means,
To have someone love you,
To open your heart, freely?
Love…
Give me love,
Only love…
What else is there?
Two eyes not seeing,
And two arms not sharing,
And two lips not feeling,
What good are they?
Doesn’t the night seem endless?
Doesn’t the day go slow?
Doesn’t the dark look friendless, and Oh!
What good is that?
--- Unknown ---
So…
Give me love,
Only love…
--- Unknown ---
That’s everything!
--- Unknown ---
Two eyes start seeing,
And two arms start sharing,
And two lips start knowing how good it is!
--- Unknown ---
To feel, to touch, to care!
For after all, after love, what else is there?
--- Unknown ---
Niko! Niko!
--- Unknown ---
There’s a girl at the bend of the road,
And she is waiting for you!
Waiting for you!
--- Unknown ---
There’s a girl in a house at the bend of the road,
And she is waiting for you!
Waiting for you!
--- Unknown ---
Niko!
--- Unknown ---
There’s a girl in a room in a house
at the bend of the road,
And she is waiting for you!
Waiting for you!
--- Unknown ---
There’s a girl on a bed
There’s a girl on a bed
There’s a girl on a bed
In a room in a house at the bend of the road,
Waiting for you!
--- Unknown ---
Niko!
--- Unknown ---
But the night is warm and she needs no sheets,
So she kicks that sheet to the bottom of the bed,
To the bottom of the bed in the lonely room,
Of the house at the bend of the road.
--- Unknown ---
Niko!
--- Unknown ---
She will call your name,
But when you won’t come,
She will sit and cry like a little girl,
Like a little girl on the empty bed
In the lonely room of the big old house,
The house at the bend of the road!
--- Unknown ---
There’s a girl at the bend of the road,
And she is waiting for you!
Waiting for you!
--- Unknown ---
There’s a girl in a house at the bend of the road,
And she is waiting for you!
Waiting for you!
--- Unknown ---
There’s a girl in a room in a house
at the bend of the road,
And she is waiting for you!
Waiting for you!
--- Unknown ---
There’s a girl on the bed,
There’s a girl on the bed!
--- Unknown ---
Who is it? Who is there?
It’s me, Niko!
Come in…
