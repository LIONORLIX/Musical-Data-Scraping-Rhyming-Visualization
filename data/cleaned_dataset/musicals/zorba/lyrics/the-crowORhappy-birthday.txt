------ The Crow/Happy Birthday ------
--- Unknown ---
Soon we’ll here the crow whistle a low,
Beckoning note.
Then someone will turn,
Face to the wall, clutching her throat.
--- Unknown ---
I want her watch!
I want her shoes!
I want her gown!
I want the ribbon!
--- Unknown ---
Soon we’ll see the crow perch on the sill,
Stare at the door.
Then make up his wings,
Shadows that spill over the floor.
Crow, come from the clouds,
Black as the shroud she’s never worn,
Crow cackle and cry, what does it ????
Never was born!
--- Unknown ---
Soon we’ll see the crow,
Circle and dive, flutter and climb,
Then, someone in bed,
Barely alive, knows it’s the time.
--- Unknown ---
Look! Look!
--- Unknown ---
Oh, Canavaro – how young I was,
How beautiful, like a dove!
And you are beautiful still,
My dove – and young!
--- Unknown ---
So young!

My mother dressed me in a white organdy gown,
and she said, “Ladies and Gentlemen,
my beautiful daughter!
It’s her birhtday, she’s 16 years old.”
And my mother said,
“You will dance through life.
You will dance all through life!”
--- Unknown ---
My mother says that little girls are made of sugar.
Happy birthday! (Happy birthday!)
My mother says my life will be a wide, white ribbon.
Happy birthday! (Happy birthday!)
And all my tomorrows are waiting in a line
Shimmering, glimmering, soon to be mine.
--- Unknown ---
My mother says,
She looks at me and she remembers.
Happy birthday! (Happy birthday!)
She envies me the love I’m just about to see.
But she was yesterday (she was yesterday)
And I’m tomorrow (I’m tomorrow)
Happy birthday (Happy birthday)
To me!
--- Unknown ---
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Happy birthday! (Happy birthday!)
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Happy birthday! (Happy birthday!)
