------ The First Time ------
--- Unknown ---
I hear a bouzouki…
You can’t imagine how often
I’ve heard a bouzouki,
But each time is the first time.
--- Unknown ---
I sniff at a woman…
You can’t imagine how often
I’ve sniffed at a woman,
But each time is the first time.
--- Unknown ---
I pound on a table, I leap on a chair,
I crawl up a mountain,
to breathe in the air,
By now I’ve stopped counting
How often I’ve been there,
But each time is the first time.
--- Unknown ---
I look at a flower,
I stick my nose in, or stare at,
or sleep on a flower,
But each time is the first time.
--- Unknown ---
I soar like a seagull, I stamp like a bull,
I comb out my whiskers, so ladies can pull,
I chew on the mutton until my belly’s full,
But each time…
--- Unknown ---
A hat, a dumbeg, a person, each time is new.
For instance, I came up and I talked to you.
Look how interesting I am!
--- Unknown ---
(That’s true!)
--- Unknown ---
Even if it’s not a long talk,
Even if you don’t talk the same language…
Do you want to hear a story?
--- Unknown ---
(Well, I…)
--- Unknown ---
Then I’ll tell you!
--- Unknown ---
There was a night in Beirut
I never will forget
When I ran across the nicest man
I think I ever met
--- Unknown ---
We were sitting drinking vodka
In this waterfront cafe;
I could tell he was a Turk,
But I liked him anyway!
--- Unknown ---
Well, we had so much to drink
That we decided we should speak;
I’m not so good in Turkish,
He was even worse in Greek.
--- Unknown ---
But we wanted to communicate,
And suddenly, by chance,
We hit upon a system,
And we both began to dance.
--- Unknown ---
We couldn’t talk the language,
So we danced it all instead,
And the two of us could understand
What one another said.
--- Unknown ---
So we had our conversation,
Which was crazy, I recall,
But it seemed it was the first time
I had ever talked at all!
--- Unknown ---
Wait! You!
--- Unknown ---
(Me?)
--- Unknown ---
Show!
--- Unknown ---
He says he’s from Ankara.
--- Unknown ---
He says he has a wife and two small children.
--- Unknown ---
He says he misses them very much!
--- Unknown ---
So you see, he’s been away now for 18 months.
--- Unknown ---
(No! 17!)
--- Unknown ---
Say that again…
--- Unknown ---
Seventeen…
--- Unknown ---
(song continues…)
--- Unknown ---
I walk with the Devil,
he gives me a poke,
And all 10 commandments,
go right up in smoke,
But each one I’ve broken,
I feel that I broke for the first time!
--- Unknown ---
The first time!
--- Unknown ---
I talk to a stranger,
You can’t imagine how often
I talk to a stranger,
But this time,
This time,
