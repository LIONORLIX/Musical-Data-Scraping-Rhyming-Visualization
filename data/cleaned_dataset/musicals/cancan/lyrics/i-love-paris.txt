------ I Love Paris ------
--- VERSE ---
Ev'ry time I look down
On this timeless town,
Whether blue or gray be her skies,
Whether loud be her cheers
Or whether soft be her tears,
More and more do I realize
--- REFRAIN ---
--- Unknown ---
I love Paris in the springtime,
I love Paris in the fall,
I love Paris in the winter, when it drizzles,
I love Paris in the summer, when it sizzles,
I love Paris ev'ry moment
Ev'ry moment of the year.
I love Paris,
Why, oh, why do I love Paris?
