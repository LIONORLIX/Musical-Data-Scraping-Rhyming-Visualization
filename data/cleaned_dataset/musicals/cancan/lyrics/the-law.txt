------ The Law ------

--- ARISTIDE ---
Since the time, not so far,
When admitted to the bar,
I've maintained, once 'tis made,
That the law must be obeyed.
So if these girls overrode
And defied the legal code,
They have broken the law
And I can't condone this flaw.
--- PAUL ---
But to imprison them
Would be deplorable!
--- ARISTIDE ---
They have broken the law.
--- PRESIDENT ---
But each is such a gem
And so adorable!
--- ARISTIDE ---
I adore even more the law.

--- ARISTIDE ---
The law is my life, the law is my wife,
For the law I was fated, to the law I am mated.
You can show me the beauty
Of the fairest woman you ever saw,
To the beauty of her, I would absolutely prefer
The beauty, the beauty, the beauty of the law,
For so much I love the beauty of the law.
ALL OTHERS:
The law is your life, the law is your wife,
For the law you were fated,
--- ARISTIDE ---
To the law I am mated.
So a lady can write me quite
The warmest letter you ever saw,
To the letter from her, I would positively prefer
The letter, the letter, the letter of the law,
For so much I love,
--- ALL OTHERS ---
So much you love
--- ARISTIDE ---
The letter of
--- ALL OTHERS ---
The letter of
--- ARISTIDE ---
The law

--- JUDGE ---
I shall always respect
Any maid who is correct
But I will have no truck
With a maid who runs amuck.
Let my colleagues lose their heads
0ver far from thoroughbreds,
I am wed to my work,
Thus I never go berserk.
--- CLERK ---
The word is berserk, your honor,
Not berserk.
--- JUDGE ---
I stand corrected, Mister Clerk.
--- OTHERS ---
The word is berserk, your honor,
Not berserk.
