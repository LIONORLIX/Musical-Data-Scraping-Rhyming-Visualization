Some think an artist's life could never be sad
Some think an artist's life could only be bad.
When people ask about la vie de boheme,

Never, never be an artist
If you think you can make one cent.
Never, never be an artist
If you've no one to pay your rent.
Never, never be an artist
If you like roast beef called prime.
Never, never be an artist
Unless you want to have a marvelous time,
Unless you want to have a marvelous time.
