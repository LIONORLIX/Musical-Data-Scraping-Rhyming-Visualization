--- PISTACHE ---
If I have succeeded in life So far,
'Tis because my mama was my guiding star.
When I was a baby upon her knee,

--- REFRAIN ---
Never give anything away, away, away,
'Tis very unwise,
Never give anything away, away, away,
Do not compromise,
Be economical, I say, I say, I say,
And you will do well,

That you can sell.

Try to remember, ma belle,
Never give anything away, away, away
That you can sell.
