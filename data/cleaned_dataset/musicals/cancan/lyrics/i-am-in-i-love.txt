------ I Am In I Love ------
--- REFRAIN ---
--- Unknown ---
I am dejected,
I am depressed,
Yet resurrected
And sailing the crest.
Why this elation,
Mixed with deflation?
What explanation?
I am in love!
Such conflicting questions ride
Around in my brain,
Should I order cyanide
Or order champagne?
Oh, what is this sudden jolt?
I feel like a frighten'd colt
Just hit by a thunderbolt,
I am in love!
I knew the odds
Were against me before,
I had no flair
For flaming desire,
But since the gods
Gave me you to adore,
I may lose
But I refuse to fight the-fire!
So come and enlighten my days
And nerer depart.
You only can brighten the blaze
That burs in my heart,
For I am wildly in love with you,
And so in need of
A stampede of
------ fin ------
