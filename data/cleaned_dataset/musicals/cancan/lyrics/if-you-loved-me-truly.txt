------ If You Loved Me Truly ------
--- CLAUDINE ---
I'm always happy when I am dancing.
I have no cares, I have no ills,
I feel like a bird above the hills,
When dancing, my cup of happiness fills
Right up to my brain.
--- BORIS ---
When a woman has a man, listen here,
She should think of nothing but him.
--- 3 GIRLS ---
Claudine, go on a strike!
--- 3 BOYS ---
You women are all alike.
--- CLAUDINE ---
I'd love to make a career of dancing.
I'd dance so well, I'd go so far,
They'd cheer me from here to Zanzibar
And in ev'ry dance hall I'd be a star,
The belle of the ball!
--- BOYS ---
When a woman has a man, her career
Should amount to nottling at all.
--- 3 GIRLS ---
Go out and get your fame!
--- 3 BOYS ---
You women are all the same.
--- 2ND & 3RD GIRLS ---
If you could have a career, Claudine,
The world would be at your feet.
--- 1ST GIRL ---
If you could have a career, Claudine,
Mon dieu, the men you could meet!

--- 1ST GIRL ---
A South African millionaire,
--- 3RD GIRL ---
Our newly elected president,
--- 1ST GIRL ---
I hope he isn't impotent!

A viscount who's filthy rich,
--- 1ST GIRL ---
A Rothschild, no matter which,
--- 3RD GIRL ---
The Nizam of Hyderabad,
--- 1ST GIRL ---
The Prince of wales can still be had!
--- GIRLS ---
Shut up, shut up!
--- 3 GIRLS & BORIS ---
Shut up, yourself, you dirty pup!
--- 2ND GIRL ---
The dear Duc d'Anjou
Would give you a bike built for two.
--- 1ST GIRL ---
The Rajah of Mysore
Would give you a bed for three or four.
--- 3RD GIRL ---
The Earl of Athlone
Would give you a bathtub of your own.
--- 1ST GIRL ---
And good King Leopold
Would give you a toothpick.
--- CLAUDINE ---
Give me a toothpick?
--- 1ST GIRL ---
Made of gold!
--- BORIS ---
Stop, Stop this insane, this endless hullabaloo
While I explain a sculptor's point of view:
Praxiteles was a sculptor. He had a girl,
She didn't want to be a dancer.
Miclielangelo was a sculptor. He had a girl,
She didn't want to be a dancer.
And I, the greatest sculptor of them all, I have a girl,
Does she want to be a dancer?
--- CLAUDINE ---
Yes is the answer!
--- 3 GIRLS ---
Yes is the answer!
--- CLAUDINE ---
I want to be a dancer and kick up my heels.
--- BORIS ---
But if you're a dancer, who'll cook my meals?
--- CLAUDINE ---
I want to be a dancer and wear pretty frocks.
--- 3 BOYS ---
But if you're a dancer, who'll darn his socks?
--- 3 GIRLS ---
You're just as bad as he is!
--- 3 BOYS ---
You're just as mad as she is!
--- 3 GIRLS ---
You're just as bad!
--- 3 BOYS ---
You're just as mad!
--- 3 GIRLS ---
You're just as bad!
--- 3 BOYS ---
You're just as mad!
--- CLAUDINE ---
But not as sad as I,
Boris, you know why.
--- VERSE ---
--- SHE ---
You don't love me, 'tis clear to see.
--- HE ---
I don't love you? You don't love me.
--- SHE ---
You only think of your life, never of mine.
--- HE ---
I only think of my life? What a line!
--- SHE ---
If you loved me,
--- HE ---
If you loved me!
--- SHE ---
If you loved me,

REFRAINS l, 2, AND 3
--- SHE ---
If you loved me truly, if you love
Then you would not, should not, could not
So selfish be.
--- HE ---
If you loved me truly, you must agree
That you would not, should not, could not
Say that to me.
--- SHE ---
(1) You freak, you fool!
(2) You pig, you pill!
(3) You scourge, you scum!
--- HE ---
(1) You molecule!
(2) You imbecile!
(3) You vacuum!

Nonetheless, I love you, love you truly, truly,
