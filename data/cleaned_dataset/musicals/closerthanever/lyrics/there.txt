------ There ------
--- Unknown ---
Woman 2
There
He was never there
Every time we talked
I'd look in his eyes
And his mind was...where?
--- Unknown ---
I don't mean to say
Life was gloom and doom
Things were always pleasant
If i needed help
He was in the room
He just wasn't present
--- Unknown ---
He just wasn't there
Never really there
I felt so unhinged
I went out and binged
Had that dumb affair
--- Unknown ---
Still the fault's not mine
Quoting gertrude stein
There was just no there there
There there
--- Unknown ---
Don't know why i care
'Cept that i am here
'Cause he wasn't
--- Unknown ---
Man 3 (woman 2)
There	(there)
I was never...(there)
...there
She was always (there)
Saying george be (there)
And my mind said...where?
--- Unknown ---
Did i have a choice?
Love is worth a fight
Not a thing you squander (yoo hoo george?)
Then i'd hear her voice (george?)
Urgent and uptight (hello?)
And my mind would wander (come in george)
--- Unknown ---
So i wasn't there (couldn't he be there?)
Never really there (once an evening there)
And i felt maligned
That my vagrant mind
Meant i didn't care (it was clear that he didn't care)
--- Unknown ---
Then to make things smooth
She would try to soothe
Sticking in her there, there there (there there)
--- Unknown ---
Got out of her hair
'Cause she made it clear
That i wasn't there
--- Unknown ---
Woman 2 (man 3)
I'm not a jerk
Thought it's the way i seem (wanted to be there)
He had his work
I gave him time to dream (knew i should be there)
Lost my desire
Waiting till he awoke (worked at being there)
Longing for fire
Living with smoke
Isn't a joke
--- Unknown ---
Man 3 (woman 2)
I tried to go her way
Wanting things improved
Tired of being not there
--- Unknown ---
Think of my dismay
Finding she had moved
By the time i got there
--- Unknown ---
She was over there
Where the hell was there?
(there was here
Could it be more clear?)
--- Unknown ---
Both
Groping like the blind
How we hoped to find
One place we could share
--- Unknown ---
Faults we tried to hide
Living side by side
Funny, when they're there, they're there
--- Unknown ---
Woman 2
There, there
And it isn't fair
--- Unknown ---
Man 3
No, it really isn't fair
--- Unknown ---
Woman 2
That we wind up here
--- Unknown ---
Man 3
That we wind up here
--- Unknown ---
Both
When we once were
...there.
Do do do do do do do do do do do...
