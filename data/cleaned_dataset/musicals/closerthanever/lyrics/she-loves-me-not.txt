------ She Loves Me Not ------
--- Man #1 ---
She loves me not
She doesn't love me
She thinks not highly of me
It can't be true
There's some confusion
If I love her how can she love not me?
If I love her she ought to love me
Alright, she isn't in love
So she can't even stand me
She'd never hold me
My mother has often told me
If something ends in a mess
Just say I've learned my lesson
I swear I'll never, never fall in love
Unless someone else loves me
Yet isn't it nice to dream
If I could only reach out and hold her hand
I'm sure she'd love me, I'm sure she could
But I give love for what?
Poor me
I guess I've lost the war
What's living for?
Must I sit alone and waste away crying?
I'd rather die than say my love, loves me not
It's best to face it
It's gone
My life is yours
For the asking
Yet she loves me not
--- Woman ---
He loves me not
He doesn't like me
He thinks not highly of me
It can't be true
There's some confusion
If I love him how can he love not me?
If I could reach out and hold his hand
He'd smile
Then he would know I love him
Then he would gladly take my love
I know he wants to say that he loves me
But what does he say?
He says he
He says he isn't in love
He knows I don't believe it
He knows I have the fever
He knows that I'd never leave him
Even if he didn't care, I'd be there
Waving a banner to him
Though I know he loves me not
It's gone and who can trace it?
My life's yours
For the asking
And yet he loves me not
--- Man #2 ---
He loves me not
He doesn't love me
He thinks not highly of me
It can't be true
There's some confusion
If I love him, how can he love me not?
It's best to face it
It's gone
He ought to love me
My life is yours
For the asking
