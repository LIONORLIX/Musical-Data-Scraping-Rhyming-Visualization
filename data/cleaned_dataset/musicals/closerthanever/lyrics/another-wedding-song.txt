------ Another Wedding Song ------
--- Unknown ---
Man 1
The future's here
The past is dead
I won't dissect or weight it
But something small's
Been left unsaid
And now's the time to say it
--- Unknown ---
You're not my first
As well you know
Once before i leapt when marriage beckoned
But you're so much more than merely first
You are the first to be second
--- Unknown ---
Woman 2
I screwed up too
I made a vow
That lasted forty years less that i reckoned
How lucky for you for starting now
You can be first to be second
--- Unknown ---
Man 1
So what if we had bubbles that go burst
--- Unknown ---
Woman 2
--- Unknown ---
All of those mistakes are in the past
--- Unknown ---
Both
I don't care if you are not my first
--- Unknown ---
Man 1
As long as you're the first to be my last
--- Unknown ---
Woman 2
I'd better be
--- Unknown ---
Both
Here's to our first, we learned a lot
Our future will be gloriously fecund
--- Unknown ---
Woman 2
Of first we've had the same amount
--- Unknown ---
Man 1
Now we'll make each second count
--- Unknown ---
Both
From now on my first to be second comes first
