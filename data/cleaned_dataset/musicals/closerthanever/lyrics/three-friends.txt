Sorry i'm late
It's wonderful to see you
You're looking great
That i can guarantee you
Though it is true i wouldn't want to be you
It's still us three
In harmony
Isn't it all an improbable plot
Nothing in common, but look what we've got
I wouldn't like you, if friends we were not
But you have me
Theses are my friends
You haven't changed a bit
These are my friends
Who are these people?
We are still friends like the friends
That your friends ought to be
