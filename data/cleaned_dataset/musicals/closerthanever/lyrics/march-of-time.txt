------ March of Time ------
--- Unknown ---
Company
Over educated
Under stimulated
Over optimistic
Under prepared
Over complicating
Non-co-operating
Hyperventilating
--- Unknown ---
All
Scared
--- Unknown ---
And the days are numbered now
--- Unknown ---
They tumble by with mounting speed
And my life's encumbered now
With things to pay for, fix, and feed
--- Unknown ---
Women
And in my ear i hear a sound like distant drumming
--- Unknown ---
Men
At first i think it's something in the plumbing...
--- Unknown ---
All
But, no, it's something i can't stop from coming...
Ah...ah...ah...
The march of time!
--- Unknown ---
I wasn't ready for the burnouts
I wasn't ready for the jokes
I wasn't set for seeing cellulite
Or being parent to my folks
--- Unknown ---
I never thought i'd go to parties
And order perrier with lime
I wasn't ready, nearly read
For the march of time
--- Unknown ---
Man 1
Over-motivated, tightly calibrated
Major workaholic, son of a bitch
Tiger with the ladies
Born for a mercedes
And thanks to the eighties
Rich...
--- Unknown ---
All
Ah...ah...ah...
The march of time!
I wasn't ready to have inlaws
I wasn't set for things to pall
Or sex that's once a week
I'd kill for once a week
Or sex that isn't safe at all
I didn't know i had a prostrate
I didn't know i'd have a prime
I wasn't set to love the quickstep of
The march of, march of, march of, march of,
--- Unknown ---
I wasn't ready for tuitions
Or finding boyfriends for my mom
Or friends who flip their lids
Or adolescent kids who've never heard of vietnam
--- Unknown ---
I didn't know that having promise
Would get you ten cents for a dime
I wasn't taught to face the onslaught of
The march of, march of, march of
March of time!
--- Unknown ---
Woman 2
Teenage visionary, set itinerary
Got it all like clockwork, september bride
Future moving toward me
Husband who adored me
Then one awful night he...died.
--- Unknown ---
And the days seem endless now
I feel my purpose all but gone
Though i'm hardly friendless now
Each night i think i can't go on
But in the corner of my i hear this pounding
It's almost like i'm someone that's its hounding
No matter what i do it keeps resounding
--- Unknown ---
All
Ah...ah...ah...
--- Unknown ---
I wasn't ready to keep moving
I wasn't ready for the dawn
Or learning pain can fade
Recoveries get made
No matter what, your life goes on
--- Unknown ---
I didn't know that when you stumble
You get another chance to climb
--- Unknown ---
I wasn't set for lives i'd never planned
With both feet firmly set on sand
The grand relentless drum beat and
The march of time!
