------ Life Story ------
--- Unknown ---
It was a liberated marriage
We shared the household chores of course
We understood each others feelings
Right down to the day of our sensible divorce
--- Unknown ---
I didn't ask him for a penny
I'd had my liberated training
--- Unknown ---
So off he went with his hair of bronze
To find a life like Khalil Gibran's
I got my rest from the drugs he did
He got his quest,
I got the kid
--- Unknown ---
And oh,
I'm not complaining
--- Unknown ---
So I set off to be a writer,
A modern mother on her own
I wrote up happenings at galleries
Turned down jobs with salaries
Stayed freelance and alone
--- Unknown ---
I fought the battles of the sixties
Which you recall were rather draining
When men were thick, I hit the fray
Became a prick
Got equal pay
I faced down chauvinistic slobs
I won the fights
Improved the jobs
--- Unknown ---
And oh,
I'm not complaining
--- Unknown ---
My husband found himself his ashram
Lost forty pounds and went through hell
Then one day he came back from limbo
Found himself some bimbo
And moved to New Rochelle
--- Unknown ---
I raised my son and I had lovers
My choices sometimes take explaining
I'd meet some jock
My friends would scoff
He'd stay a while
I'd drive him off
I kept my space
Preserved my turf
Six months I'd send him back to surf
--- Unknown ---
And oh-oh-oh-oh-oh,
I was not complaining
--- Unknown ---
So now my son's half way through college
I pay tuition like a fine
I'm still this feisty freelance writer
Resume well honed
At a well toned forty-nine
--- Unknown ---
I find that getting work is harder
Each job I want takes more campaigning
And those sweet young things who hire me now
Those MBAs making fifty thou
Who smile and ask what I have done
When they got their jobs from the fights I won
--- Unknown ---
Ah, they should all stay home and have babies
--- Unknown ---
But I'm not complaining
--- Unknown ---
And in the evening at my window
As I watch Jersey growing dim
I feel a troubling emotion
Summed up in this notion
I wish I'd stayed with him
--- Unknown ---
Lord knows each day with him was madness
As I have spent my life maintaining
--- Unknown ---
But more and more I recall the joy
My golden dreamer
My lost boy
Our life was life in the twilight zone
But no worse than a life alone
--- Unknown ---
And oh,
Well I chose my way
And I'm not complaining
