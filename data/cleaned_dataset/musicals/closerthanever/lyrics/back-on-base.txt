------ Back on Base ------
--- Unknown ---
My scattered life had no foundation
Couldn't seem to find my space
Then all at once came inspiration
Now i'm back on base.
--- Unknown ---
My baby plays a line that subtle
Yet it makes the strongest case
An argument with no rebuttal
Got me back on base.
--- Unknown ---
When his fingers touch my strings
I tingle to my teeth
I seem to sing the wildest things
When he is underneath.
--- Unknown ---
The only worm that's in this eden
The only snag in all this lace
Is where i stand ain't easy reading
When he's back on base.
--- Unknown ---
(scat)
--- Unknown ---
At times he seems a bit elusive
Way off in his private place
I guess he can't be mine exclusive
When he's back on base.
--- Unknown ---
He's got eyes for something tall
So maybe i should go
Then once more my defences fall
When he gets down below oh oh oh oh oh oh
--- Unknown ---
So what if he don't feel like talkin'
I'll just let him play his ace
And let his fingers do the walkin'
'Til i'm back on...
--- Unknown ---
Always back on...
--- Unknown ---
So happy back on base.
--- Unknown ---
(scat)
--- Unknown ---
We make sweet music when we're both back on base
