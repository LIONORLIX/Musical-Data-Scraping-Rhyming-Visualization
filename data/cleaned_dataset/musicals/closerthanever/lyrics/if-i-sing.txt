------ If I Sing ------
--- Unknown ---
My father's pride
was in his hands.
The piano was his soul.
--- Unknown ---
I watched and wondered
as he played show tunes
miles off from rock and roll.
--- Unknown ---
What he loved he taught me.
Now music's what I do.
And often when I'm writing,
in my hands, Dad's there too.
--- Unknown ---
If I sing you are the music.
If I fly you're why I'm put.
If my hands can find some magic
you're the one who said they could.
--- Unknown ---
If the child that's still inside me
finds a song in empty air.
When there is joy in making music
it is you who put it there.
--- Unknown ---
My dad grew old.
His hands were numb.
And now he cannot play.
--- Unknown ---
I came to visit.
He sat and asked me
How can it be this way?
--- Unknown ---
I couldn't find an answer.
I played this tune for him instead.
My father sat there smiling
for he knew what it said.
--- Unknown ---
If I sing you are the music.
If I love you taught me how.
Every day your heart is beating
in the man that I am now.
--- Unknown ---
If my ears are tuned to wander.
If when I reach the chords are there.
When there is joy in making music,
it's a joy that we both share.
--- Unknown ---
I never told you.
It took time till I could see
that if I sing you are the music
and you'll always sing in me.
--- Unknown ---
Yes you'll always live in me.
