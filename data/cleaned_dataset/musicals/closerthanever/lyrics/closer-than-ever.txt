------ Closer Than Ever ------
--- Unknown ---
Company
Well what d'ya know, a door locked tight
Opens at last and shows some light
Once more a door you tried and tried
Gives and you're on the other side
You were unsure and yet somehow
Look at where you are standing now
Out of the blue
An answer comes to you
You never knew you knew
--- Unknown ---
Man 2
Nobody thought we'd last
Good thing we never knew it
It's funny how after all these years we're closer than ever
--- Unknown ---
We had so much to learn
Some days i thought we blew it
But strange as it seems it took the pain
To bind us together
Closer than ever
--- Unknown ---
And now
We're steadier by half
Thank god we learned to laugh
Thank god when you found your new you
I loved her too
--- Unknown ---
We still have our stormy days
Even the worst can't shake us
If all we have come through could not break us
What's ahead can only make us
Stronger than ever
Clearer than ever
I'm closer than ever to you
--- Unknown ---
Woman 2
We still have our stormy days
Man 2
Even the worst can't shake us
All
If all we have come through could not break us
What's head can only make us stronger than ever
Clearer than ever
I'm closer than ever to you
--- Unknown ---
Bows...
