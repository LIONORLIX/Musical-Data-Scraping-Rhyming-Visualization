------ Miss Byrd ------
--- Unknown ---
Woman 2
The sign says i'm miss byrd
And that's my name
I'm one of those people who all look the same
At work i'm hardly seen
I come and go
But i know something that people don't know
--- Unknown ---
Every one who sees me thinks
That i'm that dull miss byrd
I could blow that myth apart
But i don't say a word
--- Unknown ---
I sit here at my desk
And no one knows
Not twenty minutes ago
I was not wearing clothes
I was in someone's arms, in someone's bed
Oh what the thought of it does to my head
--- Unknown ---
If it's true a bird makes music
When her heart takes wing
This byrd is singing
Miss byrd is singing
I'm singing i'm in love
But i'm not saying a thing
--- Unknown ---
Uh uh
Oooh oooh
--- Unknown ---
Down in apartment a
The super's aptly named
Last week i went to the basement
More hours than i claimed
He says i'm super too
He calls me hot
I show those basement apartments a lot
--- Unknown ---
Back at work i'm crisp and fresh
Reliable miss byrd
Seals are dancing in my flesh
But i don't say a word
--- Unknown ---
I'm showing penthouse c
As i begin
I still feel his hands sliding over my skin
My nipples start to throb
Inside my bra
That's when i start to go la-dah-di-dah
--- Unknown ---
If you've never felt the lift
A little lunch can bring
This byrd is singing
Miss byrd is singing
I'm singing i'm on fire
But i'm not saying a thing
--- Unknown ---
No no no no oh oh oh...
--- Unknown ---
This is a floor thru five
I call it more a six
The broken kitchenette tiles they will fix
--- Unknown ---
Lots of girls who first seems shy
Have secrets i have found
If you think i'm special
I suggest you look around
--- Unknown ---
That little office temp
Who seems so dumb
How come a trip to mcdonald's
Is making her hum?
--- Unknown ---
And mrs. Smith in sales
Who's turning grey
Why is she smiling that curious way?
--- Unknown ---
If it's true the drabbest songbirds
Come alive in spring
The birds are singing
Miss byrd is singing
I'm singing
I'm in love
But i'm not saying a thing
--- Unknown ---
No no no no no no no no
--- Unknown ---
Mum's the word
--- Unknown ---
La la la la
Heard melodies are sweet, but those unheard...oo-wee
--- Unknown ---
La la la la...
Shh.....
