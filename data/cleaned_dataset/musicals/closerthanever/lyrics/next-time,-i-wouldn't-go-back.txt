Man 2
She's at your door are your eyes deceiving you?
Your life takes off and there's not retrieving you
Then there's the door that shuts as she's leaving you
--- Unknown ---
Doors

Last night my dream collapsed around my ears
But that's no reason to go round in tears
I'll start another dream this minute, without her in it
--- Unknown ---
And next time, the stars will sing to me
Next time, the girl will cling to me
Next time, like perfect lovers we'll be
This time, i planned it badly,
But i'll do better next time
Next time, next time.
--- Unknown ---
Yet we began in such a perfect way
And strings of next times won't make one today
What dream is worth the fight to win it
If she's not in it?
Others
For next time can't be as sweet or as tender	 ah.. Ah.. Ah...
Or promise half of the splendour
That this time promised to me
Next time is self deception
What i want now is this ah.. Ah.. Ah...
This time, this time... This time the stars will sing to me
This time my love will cling to me
Next time
--- Unknown ---
All
Like perfect lovers we'll be
--- Unknown ---
Man 2 others
Next time is self deception ah.. Ah.. Ah...
What i want now is this time ah.. Ah.. Ah...
And somehow
I'll have i'll have, i'll have, i'll have
Next time next time, next time, next time

Everyday another door!

Men	 women

Everyday another door

Woman 2
Well, wha'd'ya know?
Well, wha'd'ya know?
In front of me now is an open door
I'm moving ahead not sure of the way
And yet there's a light that i'm heading for
--- Unknown ---
Now if someone had said to me a year ago
That i would take the trip i'm taking now
I would have said, you're crazy,
I'll be better off right here
But here i am, amazed to find
That i can turn and walk right through the door
And what is more
I wouldn't go back, i wouldn't go back
As strange as i feel i simply couldn't go back
I'll never go back where i was before.
--- Unknown ---
Men women
Well, wha'd'ya know?
Well, wha'd'ya know?
Well, wha'd'ya know?
Well, wha'd'ya know?
The person i was
I've hidden myself
Is a stranger now
In some real safe places
Man 1
Don't know what's ahead
Woman 1
Don't know where i am
Man 2
Or where i must go
Woman 2
But now for a change
--- Unknown ---
Men	 women
But when the time comes
I'm here
I'll get through somehow
Facing empty spaces
Now if someone had said to me	 if someone said a
A year ago	 year ago
That i might never have a
Love at all	 that i might never have a love at all
--- Unknown ---
All
I would have said you're crazy
I'd have burst right into tears
But hear i am prepared to face the person here in me i never knew
And said it's true
And i wouldn't go back
I wouldn't go back
As scared as i am i simply couldn't go back
Whatever i held onto once is through
Well
--- Unknown ---
Women	 men
Well, wha'd'ya know?
Well, wha'd'ya know?
Well, wha'd'ya know?
Well, wha'd'ya know?
The universe shakes
The firmament spins
The ground is above
The sky is below
I'm feeling the barriers crumble and fall
I'm not even sure where
I'm heading at all
--- Unknown ---
All
I'm moving ahead and i'm gaining a pace
And i'm flying through time
And i'm out into space
--- Unknown ---
If someone told me even just a week ago
That i would feel the way i feel right now
I would have said impossible, not in a million years!
--- Unknown ---
Men
But here i am amazed to find i've turned my back on all i was before
--- Unknown ---
All
And closed the door
And i wouldn't go back, i wouldn't go back
For once and for all i know i couldn't go back
I'll never go back, ever go back
Not to where i was before.
--- Unknown ---
Next time, like perfect lovers we'll be
--- Unknown ---
Men women
Next time, this time
The man will sing to me
Next time
The man will cling to me
Somehow
--- Unknown ---
All
I'll have,
I'll have,
I'll have,
I'll have
Next time,
Next time,
Next time,
Next time.
