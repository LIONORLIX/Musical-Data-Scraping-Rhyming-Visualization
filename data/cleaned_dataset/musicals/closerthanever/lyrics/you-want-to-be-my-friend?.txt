You're so good
You're too good for me you are
You're the best damn person
I have known by far
If i could,
You know i'd never throw this curve
You're a goddess
And i'm not what you deserve
What i am saying is
Our thing must end
But though it must
I want to be your friend

And my singles cruise

Colleagues from the zoo

I want a lover and a husband
And a partner and a spouse

On a summer house

I want a father for my unborn children
Someone who's in tune
And since i'll be thirty-nine next month
I want him rather soon
I want someone to buy rugs and lamps with
Someone who'll co-sign
I want a small joint bank account
In his name and in mine

I need someone i can fight with
Learn to cook with
Love to feed
Come to think of it
There's only one thing that i do not need

I don't need to hear from you i'm perfect
Then end up all wet
I am tired of being the greatest girl
A man has ever met
Ha! Can't you see?
You don't want to tell the truth, oh no
You just want out from me
Yes, i know inside you're fragile
Yes, you're mother was a mess
If that's why you can't receive a woman's love
I could care less.
I don't need to know it's your fault
Have some balls
It doesn't fit
You're not sick, deprived, misunderstood or weak
You're just a shit!
And you wanna be my friend
Who'd want you as a friend?
