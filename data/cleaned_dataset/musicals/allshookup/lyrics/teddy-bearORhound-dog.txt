Baby let me be,
Your lovin' Teddy Bear
Put a chain around my neck,
and lead me anywhere
Oh let me be
Your teddy bear.

Baby let me be,
Around you every night
Run your fingers through my hair,
And cuddle me real tight
Oh let me be
Your teddy bear.
--- Unknown ---
You ain't nothin' but a hound dog
Snoopin' round my door
You ain't nothin' but a hound dog
Snoopin' round my door
You better wag your tail
Cause I ain't gonna feed you no more
--- Unknown ---
You told me you were high class
I can see through that
Yes, you told me you were high class
I can see through that (She sees through that)
And Daddy I know that you ain't no real cool cat
--- Unknown ---
I don't wanna be a tiger (You ain't nothing but a hound dog)
Cause tigers play too rough (No, no, no, no)
I don't wanna be a lion (You're not)
'Cause lions ain't the kind you love enough.

He just wants to be (He ain't nothing but a hound dog)
Her teddy bear (Cryin' all the time)
Put a chain around his neck and leads you anywhere (Hound dog, just the way)
Oh let him be (He ain't never caught a rabbit)
Your teddy bear (And he ain't your teddy bear)
--- Unknown ---
You ain't nothing but a hound dog (Just wanna be)
Cryin' all the time (Your darlin' teddy bear)
You ain't nothing but a hound dog (Put a chain around my neck)
Cryin' all the time (And lead me anywhere)
--- Unknown ---
Oh let me be (Just say you'll be)
He ain't no friend of mine (Mine)
You ain't never caught a rabbit and you ain't no friend of mine (Ow, ow, ow)
You ain't never caught a rabbit and you ain't no friend of mine (Just say you'll be mine)
--- Unknown ---
I just wanna be your teddy bear.
