------ One Night With You ------
--- Unknown ---
One night with you
Is what I'm now praying for
The things that we two could plan
Would make my dreams come true
--- Unknown ---
Just call my name
And I'll be right by your side
I want your sweet helping hand
My loves too strong to hide
--- Unknown ---
Always lived, very quiet life
I ain't never did no wrong
Now I know that life without you
Has been too lonely too long
--- Unknown ---
