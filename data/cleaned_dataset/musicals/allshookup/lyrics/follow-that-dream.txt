------ Follow That Dream ------
--- Unknown ---
Follow that dream, I gotta follow that dream
Keep a-movin, move along, keep a moving
I've got to follow that dream wherever that dream may lead
I've got to follow that dream to find the love I need
--- Unknown ---
When your heart gets restless, time to move along
When your heart gets weary, time to sing a song
But when a dream is calling you,
There's just one thing that you can do
--- Unknown ---
Well, you gotta follow that dream wherever that dream may lead
You gotta follow that dream to find the love you need
--- Unknown ---
Keep a-movin, move along, keep a moving
--- Unknown ---
Got to find me someone whose heart is free
Someone to look for my dream with me
And when I find her I may find out
Just what my dreams are all about
--- Unknown ---
I've got to follow that dream wherever that dream may lead
I've got to follow that dream to find the love I need
--- Unknown ---
I've got to follow that dream wherever that dream may lead
I've got to follow that dream to find the love I need
--- Unknown ---
Keep a-movin, move along
Keep a-movin, move along
