FRANKIE: Well hey sunshine!
MARY: Sunshine? Looks like rain to me
FRANKIE: Not in here it don't.
MARY: Why Frankie Epps, quit that, you hear?
FRANKIE: What? I ain't doin' anything!
--- Unknown ---
I'm gonna go to the picture show
There's a movie I've got to see
You know the one, called The Silver Gun
Well, I been watchin' since Chapter Three
I can't wait, it's at eight
And I was wonderin' if you're free
--- MARY ---
Go on, go on, go on, go on
You know my mama'd never let me till I turn sixteen
Go on, go on, go on, go on
Besides I only go to pictures that I haven't seen
--- Unknown ---
FRANKIE: Well when do you turn sixteen
MARY: Two years from next June
FRANKIE: Too bad about your mama
MARY: Too bad for you
--- FRANKIE ---
I know a spot near McConnach's lot
Where you can see the parade real clear
I got a book, you wanna take a look?
It's called The Theif and the Brigadier
I got gum, you want some?
--- MARY ---
I haven't chewed gum fer a year!
--- FRANKIE ---
Go on, go on, go on, go on
I bet your mama'd let me take you to the picture show
--- MARY ---
Go on, go on, go on, go on
I guess you weren't really listening when I said No!
--- Unknown ---
Why not ask Iola Stover
Her mama lets her do whatever she wants
--- FRANKIE ---
Well, maybe I will
--- MARY ---
I hope you do
--- Unknown ---
FRANKIE: Where you goin'?
MARY: To the factory, I didn't get my pay this week
FRANKIE: Okay. I'll see you around.
MARY: At the picture show
FRANKIE: What? I thought your mama wouldn't let you.
MARY: She will with Essie and Betty-Jean. Just not with you.
FRANKIE: Bye sunshine!
De de de de de de de de de de
