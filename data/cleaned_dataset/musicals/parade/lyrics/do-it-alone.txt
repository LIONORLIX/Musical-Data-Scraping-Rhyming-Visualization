------ Do it Alone ------
--- LUCILLE ---
Do it alone, Leo - do it all by yourself.
You're the only one who matters after all.
Do it alone, Leo - why should it bother me?
I'm just good for standing in the shadows
And staring at the walls, Leo.
Fight them, strong and proud -
Pray your voice is loud,
Loud enough to make it through that door.
What on earth have I been worried for?
Soon I won't be worried anymore.
--- LEO ---
Lucille, how can you say that?
--- LUCILLE ---
No, do it alone, Leo - now there's the right idea:
Make me feel as useless as you always have.
Do it alone, Leo - what could a woman do?
After all, so many people love you,
They're dancing in the streets, Leo.
Only you know how
To change the future now -
No one knows the pain you're going through -
No one else is suffering but you.
I could be a quiet little girl
And cook your little meal,
And swallow all I feel,
And bow to your command;
Or I could start to screa,
Across the whole damned South
And never shut my mouth
Until they understand.
--- Unknown ---
But I can't do it alone, Leo.
Look at me now, Leo.
I can be more:
I can bring you home, Leo.
We can bring you home, Leo.
