------ The Dream of Atlanta ------
--- TOWNSPEOPLE ---
Ever More lives the dream of Atlanta
Ever more Her eternal Pride
Strong and sure is the dream of Atlanta
When Her Brothers are unified
And the sound of Her voice is clearer
When Her People are proud and free
Not a star to the sky could be nearer
