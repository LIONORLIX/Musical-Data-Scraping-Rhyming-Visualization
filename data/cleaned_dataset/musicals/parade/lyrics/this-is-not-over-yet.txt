------ This Is Not Over Yet ------
--- Unknown ---
LEO: (spoken) Oh, my sweet Lucille, how did you ever manage it?
You don't know what any of this means?
--- Unknown ---
(sang)
It means cancel all your parties,
Forget your big parade...
It means the crowds will not be cheering,
so despite what you've been hearing,
You can lay down you're spade.
--- Unknown ---
It means my mother can stop crying...
My Rabbi's eulogy can wait...
It means that Dorsey can stop beaming,
and my cousin can stop dreaming
of his portion of my estate...
--- Unknown ---
It means no, this isn't over.
No, the dates not set!
No, I won't wake up tomorrow,
drowning in my sweat.
It means I've got the greatest partner,
anyman can get.
It means I'll never, ever, ever, underestimate that woman,
'cause this is not over yet.
--- Unknown ---
Tell my uncle not to worry, tell the reaper not to hurry,
make the hangman stop his drumming,
'cause I'm coming into town to win the day.
Somehow I haven't with my scheming,
screwed things up beyond redeeming, and we're finally on our way!
--- Unknown ---
And, no! This isn't over!
Hell, it's just begun!
Hail the resurrection of the South's least favorite son!
It means I made a vow for better, and two is better than one.
--- Unknown ---
It means the journey ahead might get shorter,
I might reach the end of my rope!
But suddenly now, there's a mortar, there is hope! Finally, hope!
--- Unknown ---
LUCILLE: Yes, Leo, there is hope!
--- Unknown ---
LEO: And, no! This isn't over!
--- Unknown ---
LUCILLE: No this isn't over.
--- Unknown ---
LEO: No, we aren't through!
--- Unknown ---
LUCILLE: We're finally on our way!
--- Unknown ---
LEO: No, there's still a million things! You an I can do!
--- Unknown ---
LUCILLE: I will speak for you Leo!
--- Unknown ---
LEO: And I would never have believed it!
--- Unknown ---
TOGETHER: The things I see in you!
--- Unknown ---
LEO: It means a man who isn't guilty, doesn't have to walk to plank!
It means the gallows still are vacant,
and we've got my wife to thank,
--- Unknown ---
TOGETHER: It means you shouldn't underestimate Lucille and Leo Frank!
'Cause this is not over yet!
