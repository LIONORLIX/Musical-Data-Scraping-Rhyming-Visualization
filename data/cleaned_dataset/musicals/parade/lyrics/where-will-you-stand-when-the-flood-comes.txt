WHERE WILL YOU STAND WHEN THE FLOOD COMES?
SLATON
I have an announcement to make:
Leo Frank is no longer a prisoner in the Fulton Tower.
At five o'clock this morning, he was removed to another prison location,
which will not be disclosed at this time.
--- WATSON ---
Will you walk with your head held high?
Or move aside when they're passin' you by?
Will you run when the fires are fanned?
And where will you stand when the flood comes?
--- Unknown ---
Will you ride by the side of God
Or will you hide in the soil and the sod?
Will you fight for the soul of your land?
Well, where will you stand when the flood comes?
Where will you stand when the flood comes?

SLATON (overlapping)
Two thousand years ago,
another governor washed his hands and turned a Jew over to a mob.
Ever since then, that governor's name has been a curse.
If, today, another Jew went to his grave because I failed to do my duty,
I would all my life find his blood on my hands.
I have reviewed all the evidence in the case of the State of Georgia
against Leo Frank and I have decided
to commute his sentence from the death penalty to imprisonment for life.
All I wish now is that the people of Georgia withhold judgement until
they have given calm and careful consideration to the statement
I have prepared on the case.

Mr. Dorsey, you care to comment?
--- DORSEY ---
I was not a part of the Governor's decision, Mr. Craig. I'm as surprised as you are.
--- WATSON & ENSEMBLE ---
Will you beg for the Jew's reward
Or walk with us at the side of the Lord?
Put your soul in the Devil's hand?
Well, where will you stand when the flood comes?

WATSON (to DORSEY)
Where will you stand?
Where will you stand?
--- WATSON & ENSEMBLE ---
Where will you stand?
--- DORSEY ---
With you, Mr. Watson. I'll be proud to stand with you.
--- WATSON ---
God bless the next Governor of Georgia!
--- DORSEY ---
Yes, I see through the fog and dust,
So let the mob do whatever they must.
Slaton jumps at the Jew's command:
--- DORSEY & WATSON ---
Well, where will you stand when the flood comes?
Where will you stand?
--- ALL ---
Where will you stand?
--- CRAIG ---
And the news spread like wildfire.
An angry crowd marched north on Peachtree Street
toward the Governor's Mansion, yelling,
Hang the Yankee-lover!
--- ALL ---
See them laugh when an Angel dies!
See them tell all their Jew-loving lies!
But they'll run on the Judgement Day!
Someone's gonna pay when the flood comes!
See the blood as a city grieves!
See the stain that the Jew-money leaves!
Traitors won't keep the mobs at bay!
Someone's gonna pay when the flood comes!
--- CRAIG ---
Windows were smashed in Jewish stores.
Jacob Seligman, a clothier, was beaten and left for dead.
--- MRS. PHAGAN ---
Mary, Mary, the angel child
My child:
WATSON
Mary, Mary the angel child
Still your name and your soul are defiled.
Thank God you can't hear the things they say
But someone's gonna pay!
--- DORSEY & WATSON ---
Someone's gonna pay!
--- ALL ---
Someone's gonna pay!
Georgia, home of the strong and sure,
Fight like hell for the land of the pure!
Teach the traitor to run away!
Georgia, home of the strong and sure,
Fight like hell for the land of the pure!
Teach the traitor to run away!
Georgia, home of the strong and sure,
Fight like hell for the land of the pure!
Teach the traitor to run away!
Someone's gotta pay!
