Hey Jim! Got you a visitor, Boy.
--- SLATON ---
Hello, Jim.
--- CONLEY ---
You who I think you are?
--- SLATON ---
Coupla questions for you.
--- CONLEY ---
You want some water? Bring the Guv'nor some water.
--- SLATON ---
No, thank you.
--- CONLEY ---
We fixin' to talk 'bout that mess with Mr. Frank.
--- SLATON ---
Yes.
--- CONLEY ---
Yeah
--- CHAIN GANG ---
Yeah
--- SLATON ---
When they found the body in the basement,
Coroner's Report says there was sawdust in the mouth and lungs.
--- CONLEY ---
Hey yeah
--- CHAIN GANG ---
Yeah
--- Unknown ---
SLATON: Got any idea what that means?
--- CONLEY ---
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
--- CHAIN GANG ---
Yeah
--- SLATON ---
Means she had to be breathin' in the basement,
because there isn't any sawdust on the second floor.
Means she was alive when you carried her into the basement.
--- CONLEY ---
Then she musta come back to life,
Because she was dead as last Christmas Eve when Mr. Frank showed me the body.

Coroner's Report raises some questions about your story, wouldn't you say?
