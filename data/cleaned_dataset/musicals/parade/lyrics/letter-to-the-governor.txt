--- LETTER TO THE GOVERNOR ---
JUDGE ROAN
I have heard them in the streets, Gov'nor.
Justice! We have justice!
Through these old and tired walls.
Calling through the autumn night
That still more blood must flow
And I declared it so.
--- Unknown ---
And maybe I was wrong.
Maybe what was obvious then
Would not have been for long,
But I would not delay.
And maybe I was right -
Maybe I'm afraid that in a
Higher Judge's sight,
I won't know what to say:
So before I leave this world behind,
I have to speak my mind.
With hatred in the air,
How is any man to know
What is or isn't fair?
I left it up to Fate.
It now may be too late:
They'll be caling out to you, Gov'nor.
