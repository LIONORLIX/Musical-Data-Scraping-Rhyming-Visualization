------ How Can I Call This Home ------
--- SLATON ---
Today we honor those who honored us some fifty years ago.
Lose who gave life and limb for Georgia.
And suffered unimaginable degredation. But never defeat.
The men of Georgia, and the women of Georgia have never been defeated...
--- LEO ---
I go to bed at night
Hoping when I wake
This will all be gone
Like it was just a dream
And I'll be home again
Back again in Brooklyn
Back with people who look like I do
And talk like I do
And think like I do
But then
The sun rises in Atlanta again...
--- SLATON ---
They have risen from the ashes of war with honor and courage and strength!
--- LEO ---
These people make me tense
I live in fear they'll start a conversation
These people make no sense
They talk and I just stare and shut my mouth
It's like a foreign land
I didn't understand
That being Southern's not just being in the South
Whan I look out on all this
How can I call this Home?
--- Unknown ---
SLATON: I am proud to be a Georgian on this day
--- LEO ---
These men belong in zoos
--- ASSORTED TOWNSPEOPLE ---
Excuse me! Sorry! Get your souveneirs!
Watch your step sir
--- LEO ---
It's like they've never joined civilization
--- ASSORTED SPECTATORS ---
Where's the fella with the beer!
Mamma that man pushed me!
Lucinda! Hey now, fella!
--- LEO ---
The Jews are not like Jews
I thought that Jews were Jews
But I was wrong
--- ASSORTED SPECTATORS ---
You got ballons? I want one!
Settle down... I never in my life!
I'll take a beer!
That Slaton's handsome...
--- LEO ---
I thought I would be fine
But four years down the line
With ev'ry word it's very clear
I don't belong
--- ASSORTED SPECTATORS ---
La la la in the land o' cotton
--- LEO ---
I don't cuss, I don't drawl
So how can I call this home?
--- Unknown ---
SLATON: Proud that our state is growing and building!
--- LEO ---
Home calls, and I'm free of the Southern breeze
Free of magnolia trees and endless sunshine!
Evermore lives the dream of Atlanta
But not mine!
Not mine
--- ENSEMBLE ---
We stand together
In this great state of Georgia
--- LEO ---
A Yankee with a college education
Who by his own design
Is trapped inside the land
That time forgot
--- ENSEMBLE ---
Strong and proud
--- LEO ---
I'm trapped inside this life
And trapped beside a wife
Who would prefer that I said Howdy not Shalom
--- Unknown ---
Well I'm sorry Lucille
But I feel what I feel
And this place is surreal
