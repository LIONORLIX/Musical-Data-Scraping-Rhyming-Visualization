------ It's Hard To Speak My Heart ------
--- LEO ---
It's hard to speak my heart.
I'm not a man who bares his soul.
I let the moment pass me by -
I stay where I am in control.
I hide behind my work,
Safe and sure of what to say:
I know I must seem hard,
I know I must seem: cold.
I never touched that girl -
You think I'd hurt a child, yes?
I'd hardly seen her face before -
I swear - I swore we'd barely met.
These people try to scare you
With things I've never said.
I know it makes no sense.
I swear I don't know why:
You see me as I am - You can't believe I'd lie -
You can't believe I'd do these deeds -
A little man who's scared and blind,
Too lost to find the words he needs.
I never touched that child -
God - I never raised my hand!
I stand before you now:
Incredibly afraid.
