------ Leo at Work/What Am I Waiting For? ------
--- TOWNSPEOPLE ---
Strong and Sure is the dream of Atlanta
Where Her Brothers are unified!
--- LEO ---
Twenty-eight bottles of caps
At four dollars the gross
This is wrong, this is wrong
I can fix this, wait
Nine more boxes in back
Twenty-eight minus nine,
And then thirty-one girls on the line..
--- LUCILLE ---
Suit and a Tie...
Terribly quiet...
Quite a well-paid position
Go on Lucille
Bring him his coffee..
--- LEO ---
Times six, one eighty-six
Divide... seven sixty
God, all the noise, and on Yontiff yet...
Four cents a girl for the week
At ten cents an hour
--- LUCILLE ---
Straight from New York, Lucille!
Isn't he smart, Lucille!
--- Unknown ---
Mama, he's comin' around today
Mama, he's at the door!
Mama, I don't know what I should say
Well what are you waitin' for Lucille?
What am I waiting for?
--- LEO ---
This is wrong, this is wrong, it's an eight, not a six
--- LUCILLE ---
House and a maid
Two sets of china
Everything I ws wishin'
New winter coat
Real ermine collar
Who would have known Lucille?
Married so well Lucille?
--- Unknown ---
How can he want me, so plain, so prim?
How can he be so sure?
Don't I wish I could be sure like him?
Like Leo?
--- LEO ---
Yes Lucille, I am building a life for us
--- Unknown ---
LUCILLE: For Leo?
--- LEO ---
No Lucille, we cannot have a picnic
--- LUCILLE ---
Didn't my wishes come true for me
The day he walked throught the door?
Isn't he all that I knew he'd be?
Brilliant and filled with humility?
Loyal and stable as any tree?
So why do I wait for more?
What am I waiting for?
--- LEO ---
Twenty-tree cartons of leads
At two-sixty the gross
This is wrong, this is wrong
I can fix this...
--- Unknown ---
MARY: Hey
LEO:Yes?
MARY: I came for my pay.
LEO: Name?
