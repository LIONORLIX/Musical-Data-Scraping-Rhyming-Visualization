So, Frankie,
You say you rode downtown with Mary on the English Avenue streetcar?
--- Unknown ---
FRANKIE: Yes, sir. Mornin' of the Memorial Day Parade
--- Unknown ---
DORSEY: And can you tell us what happened?
--- FRANKIE ---
Well, she got up to go and she looked kinda funny.
And I said.... Somethin' wrong Mary?
--- Unknown ---
MARY: Mr. Frank.
--- Unknown ---
FRANKIE: Mr. Frank what?
--- Unknown ---
MARY: Looks at me.
--- Unknown ---
FRANKIE: Looks at you? Everybody looks at you!
--- Unknown ---
MARY: Not like Mr. Frank.
--- Unknown ---
FRANKIE: What's he do?
--- MARY ---
He calls my name
I turn my head
He got no words to say
His eyes get big
My face gets red
And I want to run away
And he looks
And I wait
