------ The Other Side Of The Tracks (Reprise) ------
--- BELLE ---
On the other side of the tracks,
That is where I'm going to be.
On the other side
Of that great divide
Between fame and fortune and me.
Gonna put my shadows behind me,
Give my inhibitions the ax,
And tomorrow morning you'll find me
On the other side of the tracks.
--- Unknown ---
On the other side of that line,
Where the life is fancy and free,
Gonna sit and fan
On my fat divan
While the butler buttles the tea.
But for now I'm facing the fences,
And I can't afford to relax,
'Cause the whole kaboodle commences
On the other side of the tracks.
--- Unknown ---
So I'm off and running
Over the rail,
I'm going gunning
After the quail.
Off and running,
Send me my mail
To that great big world on the other side,
The great big world on the farther side,
The great big world on the other side of the tracks,
To that great big world
That'll open wide,
To the great big world
On the other side
Of the tracks.
