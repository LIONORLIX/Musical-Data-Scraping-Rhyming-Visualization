------ I Love You ------
--- NOBLE ---
I love you,
As much as I am able,
Considering I'm wealthy,
Considering you're poor.
--- BELLE ---
That's very nice, because I love you.
--- CHORUS ---
She loves you, she loves you, she loves you...
--- NOBLE ---
I know it.
--- BELLE ---
As much as I am able,
Considering your mother
Considers me a boor.
My passion will endure for you.
--- NOBLE ---
And I will always love you.
--- BELLE ---
My heart I'll keep secure for you.
--- NOBLE ---
Though other girls are so far above you.
To show you
I am democratic,
Considering you're riff-raff
And I am well-to-do,
As Noble
And worthy of the label...
--- NOBLE & BELLE ---
As much as I am able,
I love you!
