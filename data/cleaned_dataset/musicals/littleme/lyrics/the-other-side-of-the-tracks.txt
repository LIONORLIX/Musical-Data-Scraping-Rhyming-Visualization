------ The Other Side Of The Tracks ------
--- BELLE ---
But my heart says Reach for the stars,
And my heart I cannot deny,
Though it's my hard luck
That I'm sort of stuck
On the farthest one in the sky.
So my eyes are destined to wander,
And my brain no more to relax,
'Cause there's nothing farther out yonder
Than the other side of the tracks.
--- Unknown ---
On the other side of the tracks,
It's a long and difficult climb,
But the air up there
On the bill of fare
Is a choice of lemon or lime.
And the muscles keeping your nose up
Are the only muscles you tax.
Oh, I envy someone who grows up
On the other side of the tracks.
