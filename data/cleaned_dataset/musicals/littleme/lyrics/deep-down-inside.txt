------ Deep Down Inside ------
--- BELLE ---
Somewhere, there's a darn nice fella
Deep down inside.
--- PINCHLEY ---
Deep down inside?
--- BELLE ---
Deep down in the old sub-cella'.
Somewhere, though I think he fell a-
Sleep down inside,
Deep down, dig-a, dig-a-,
Deep down inside.
--- PINCHLEY ---
Sometimes I am darn near human
Deep down inside.
--- BELLE ---
Deep down inside.
--- PINCHLEY ---
Deep down where the bass is boomin'.
Sometimes, gotta take that broom n'
Sweep down inside,
Sweep down, dig-a, dig-a-,
Deep down inside.
--- BELLE & PINCHLEY ---
No man is a true pariah
Deep down inside,
Deep down inside,
Deep down in the old spare tiah.
No man is a true Uriah
Heep down inside,
There's a lover that you just can't keep down,
Deep down inside.
Deep down inside.

BELLE: We found it, Mr. Pinchley! We found that little
bit of good in you!
PINCHLEY: Do you think other people would like me?
BELLE: Try it and see.
PINCHLEY: All right, I will. Junior!!!
JUNIOR: Did you scream, father?
PINCHLEY: Junior, how about you and me going out and
having dinner together sometime?
JUNIOR: Oh, Daddy!
PINCHLEY: He called me Daddy!
BELLE: He likes you.
PINCHLEY: And I don't even like him!
--- JUNIOR ---
In even the worst of varmints,
You'll find a good deed,
Down under the outer garments
Of malice and greed.
--- PINCHLEY ---
That little gold streak is shinin',
Believe it or not.
--- BELLE, PINCHLEY, JUNIOR ---
That is, if you don't mind minin'
Till you hit rock bottom.

Of malice and greed.

That is, if you don't mind minin'
Till you hit rock bottom.
