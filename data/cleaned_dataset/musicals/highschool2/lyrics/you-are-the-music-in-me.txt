You know the words Once Upon A Time
Make you listen.
There's a reason.

When you dream there's a chance you'll find
A little laughter or a happy ever after

Your harmony to the melody
It's echoing inside my head

A single voice
GABRIELLA:
Above the noise
--- TROY AND GABRIELLA ---
And like a common thread
