Five, Six, Seven, Eight!
Na, na, na, na,
Na, na, na, na, na, na, nah, you are the music in...
Na, na, na, na,
Na, na, na, na, na, na, nah,
you are the music in,

--- Unknown ---
You know the words "once upon a time."
Make you listen, there's a reason.
When you dream, there's a chance you'll find,
a little laughter, or happy ever after.
--- TROY AND SHARPAY ---
Your harmony to melody,
it's echoing inside my head.
A single voice,
--- Troy ---
above the noise.
--- Sharpay ---
And like a common thread,
Sing it to me!
--- TROY ---
When I hear my favorite song,
I know we belong.
You are the music in me.
--- SHARPAY ---
It's living in all of us,
it's here because...
You are the music in me.
--- Unknown ---
Na, na, na, na,
Na, na, na, na, na, na, nah,
you are the music in...
Na, na, na, na,
Na, na, na, na, na, na, nah,
you are the music in...
are the music in...

It's living in all of us,
it's here here because...
You are the music in,
me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me,
Nah, nah, nah, you are the music in.
Na, na, na, na,
Na, na, na, na, na, na, nah, you are the music ME!
