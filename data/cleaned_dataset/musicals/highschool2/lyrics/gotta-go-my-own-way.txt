------ Gotta Go My Own Way ------
--- Unknown ---
Gabriella: I gotta say what?s on my mind
Something about us doesn?t seem right?these days
Life keeps getting in the way
Whenever we try
Somehow the plan is always rearranged
It?s so hard to say
But I gotta do what?s best for me
You?ll be okay?
CHORUS
I?ve got to move on, and be who I am
I just don?t belong here
I hope you understand
We might find our place in this world someday
But at least for now
I gotta go my own way
Gabriella: Don?t wanna leave it all behind
But I get my hopes up and I watch them fall every time
Another color turns to grey
And it?s just too hard?to watch it all?slowly fade away
I?m leavin? today
?Cause I gotta do what?s best for me
You?ll be okay
Chorus
Troy: What about us? What about everything
we?ve been through?
Gabriella: What about trust?
Troy: You know I never wanted to hurt you
Gabriella: What about me?
Troy: What am I supposed to do?
Gabriella: I gotta leave but I?ll miss you
Troy: ?miss you
