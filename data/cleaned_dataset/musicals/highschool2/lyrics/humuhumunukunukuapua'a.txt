A long time ago in a land far away
Lived the pineapple princess, Tiki
She was sweet as a peach, in a pineapple way,
But so sad she hardly speaky
--- Unknown ---
Still, If you want to listen well,
You'll hear her secret wish.

I long to free a truly remarkable fish,
My sweet prince.

She dreams of a boy, who is under a spell
That has left him all wet and scaly.
--- Sharpay and Ryan ---
I sing from my heart of the power of love,
Just a girl with a ukulele.
--- Sharpay ---
Come to me, my sweet one, and be still
I'll grasp your tail and stroke each tender grill
My sweet prince.

Humuhumunukunukua'Pua'A,
Makihiki malahini-who
Humuhumunukunukua'Pua'A, Ooh.
Hawana wakawakawakaniki pu pu pu
--- Ryan, Sharpay, and the Girls ---
The clouds turned grey, and the big sky cried,
And the ocean had a fit.
--- Sharpay ---
--- Ryan, Sharpay, and the Girls ---
Then the wind went whoosh, and thunder cracked,
And mighty mount Fufu spit.
--- Sharpay ---
Mighty Mount Fufu spit!
--- Sharpay and Ryan ---

Wanna speaky, speaky, speaky with the mighty spirit Fufu

Wanna speaky, speaky, speaky
So words I will not mince.

Wanna speaky, speaky, speaky
So words I will not mince.
Please make a man of my fresh fish prince
