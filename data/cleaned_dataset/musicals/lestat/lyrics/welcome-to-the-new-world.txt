------ Welcome to the New World ------
--- ENSEMBLE ---
And there's cheer in the streets
As they shout out the windows.
Welcome to the new world of the cajun and the creole.
Welcome to the new world,
You preening, pufffed up Europeans.
Shake loose your pious shackles
For some good old superstition.
And a wealth of new beginnings!
LESTAT
What more could one expect of something new?
A feast of saints and sinners.
A homespun web of bold beginnings.
This new world boasts a most collective stew.
And so indeed I'll plunge into the stream.
Here regret no longer lingers.
New passions here I'll cling to.
In America, I'll reconstruct my dreams.
ENSEMBLE
And there's cheer in the streets
As we shout out the windows.
Welcome to the new world of the cajun and the creole.
Welcome to the new world,
You preening, pufffed up Europeans.
Shake loose your pious shackles
For some good old superstition.
And a wealth of new beginnings!
--- ENSEMBLE ---
And now it's time to rejoice
Won't you come and join the faithful.
Welcome to the new world
And the music of the people.
Welcome to the new world,
You preening, puffed up Europeans.
Shake loose your pious shackles
For some good old superstitions!
LESTAT
It's time to rejoice!
Come join the faithful!
Music of the people!
Welcome to the new world!
--- ENSEMBLE ---
Welcome to the new world
All you would-be saints and sinners
Trade in your righteous thinking
For some good old superstition
And a wealth of new beginnings
