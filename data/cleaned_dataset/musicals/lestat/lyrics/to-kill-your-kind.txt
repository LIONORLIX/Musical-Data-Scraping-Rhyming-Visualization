------ To Kill Your Kind ------
--- ARMAND ---
Be still I say.
For you excel
In virtues common in the infidel.
Mongrel bitch who feels compelled
To twist the rules to suit herself.
Do you look at me and see a fool?
Do we look like we bend for the likes of you?
What posesses you to cross that line?
When you know what it means to kill your kind?
ENSEMBLE
No greater crime than to kill your kind.
No greater crime than to kill your kind.
No greater crime than to kill your kind!
Lestat
What I did to her was a sin. And I have paid the price. And it is settled between us. Claudia, it is settled!
ARMAND
This demon rides a carousel.
She swings back and forth on the gates of hell.
Just a brat from the gutter who got washed ashore.
She's a scheming witch from the belly of a whore.
So look at me and squirm inside.
Do you think in the world there's a place to hide?
From the ancient ones
To the next in line.
It's always been a sin to kill your kind!
--- ENSEMBLE ---
No greater crime than to kill your kind.
No greater crime than to kill your kind.
No greater crime than to kill your kind!
ARMAND
There's no greater sin!
No greater crime!
Than to kill your kind!
--- ARMAND ---
Excuse me if this is unexpected.
Present company excepted.
Ignorance of what we teach
Leaves help somewhere out of your reach.
No Judas kiss is needed here.
My friends the evidence is clear.
ENSEMBLE
There's no greater crime than to kill your kind!
Armand
She set a trap. She cut him down, and even now she shows no remorse.
ARMAND
Look hard upon your dirty work.
Strong blood running back from the ashes of the earth.
Correct me, but it seems your schemes
Come back to haunt your virgin dreams.
We count not here for sex and age.
Compassion is a weakness of the mortal race!
Enough is enough! I'm done so take her!
No greater crime than to kill your maker!
ENSEMBLE
No greater crime than to kill your kind.
No greater crime than to kill your kind.
No greater crime than to kill your kind!
ENSEMBLE	 Female Vampire
No greater crime than to kill your kind.
No greater crime than to kill your kind.
No greater crime than to kill your kind!
Your crime!
No greater crime!
There's no greater crime than to kill your kind!
ENSEMBLE
No greater crime than to kill your kind.
No greater crime than to kill your kind.
No greater crime than to kill your kind...
