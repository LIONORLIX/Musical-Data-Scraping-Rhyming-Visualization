------ Right Before My Eyes (reprise) ------
--- LESTAT ---
Dear God he could have had a life.
But I was never strong enough.
I let my dark consume his light.
When my will as overshadowed by his love.
So will you bring him home to light?
I need to know he's in your hands.
God guide his soul and give him wings to fly.
He's yours to take.
