------ In Paris ------
--- ENSEMBLE ---
In Paris the bells of Notre Dame ring out
In Paris we live what we've dreamt about.
We'll not rest til the curtain of the theatre falls on a cheering crowd
--- MEN ---
For Paris she was made for us
--- WOMEN ---
Paris, she was made for us
--- ENSEMBLE ---
In Paris we all live the actor's life!

WOMAN #1
Now who indeed is that fine thing?
Such a strapping country boy.
--- Unknown ---
WOMAN #2
I'll wager he's not lonely long
A face like that is soon employed.

Nicolas
Oh my God, Lestat!
Lestat
Nicolas!
Nicolas
I can't believe it's you! What are you doing here?
Lestat
It's been too long.
Nicolas
That was my entrance. I'll be right back. Uh, Luchina, this is Lestat, the one I was telling you about. Look after him.
--- MAN ---
Feast your eyes, for chances are that all you'll get to do is stare.
--- Unknown ---
WOMAN #1
Too well-bred for the likes of you.
--- LUCHINA ---
He'll not resist this pretty pair.
WOMAN #1
I'd give my meager wages for a roll with that young stranger there.
--- MAN ---
Innocence of that sweet smile might cause your clothes to disappear.
--- Unknown ---
Lestat
I hope you realize you look rediculous.
Nicolas
Remember how we used to pretend to be dashing Parisian rogues? Well now I've found a way to make a living at it.
Lestat
If I recall, I was the dashing rogue. You always played the dim-witted servant.
Nicolas
True. How long will you be in Paris?
Lestat
Forever. I've left the Auvergne.
Nicolas
You're free. At last. I thought you'd never escape. Oh Hell, I'm on again. Don't move.

--- ENSEMBLE ---
In Paris the bells of Notre Dame ring out
In Paris we live what we've dreamt about.
We'll not rest til the curtain of the theatre falls on a cheering crowd
Applause for us in Paris comes with the life we're leading now.
MEN
In Paris we'll search for fame.
--- WOMEN ---
In Paree we are born again.
--- ENSEMBLE ---
And though the streets aren't paved with gold, in Paris we'll put our trust
For Paris, she was made for us.
LESTAT & NICOLAS
Paris, she was made for us.
