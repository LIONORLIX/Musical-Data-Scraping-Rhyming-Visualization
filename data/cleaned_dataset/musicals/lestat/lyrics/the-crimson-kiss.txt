------ The Crimson Kiss ------
--- GABRIELLE ---
For so many years, we’ve shared this path together.
Kindred spirits in the path of history.
For you, the quest to heal is all that matters.
But it’s a different road I crave these days for me.
You dwell so on a cure for your creation.
And seek a ghost from our mythology.
For now, the wonders that the world can offer
Mean more to me than ancient family trees.
To hear the waves pound the timbers of a schooner.
Fighting off the coastline of Cape Horn.
To travel in the shadow of the longboats.
To where the giants of the Arctic Ice were born.
The dangers in the the deep, dark Congo River.
Where the crocodile hunts and the python strikes.
To watch another predator in action
Could rejuvenate some meaning in your life.
The thrill to hunt in such exotic places.
I can almost taste those beauties in Siam.
The brown-skinned boys of Mykonos and Rangoon.
The shy Chinese behind their painted fans.
My need to go is hard to fight.
I want to gaze upon this world
Just like the Northern Lights.
And of all the things about you
That I’m going to miss.
It's the bond we formed together
Through this Crimson Kiss.
My son so dear, the world’s out there.
Mystery calls and I can’t resist.
But you and I have memories
Bound together by the Crimson Kiss.
Lestat
Please stay with me.
Gabrielle
I cannot.
Lestat
I did not give you the Dark Gift so you could turn and walk away from me.
Gabrielle
I gave you the gift of life knowing that someday you would walk away from me!
GABRIELLE
The wellspring of my strength unrestricted.
There’s so little I could fail to endure.
I could face a trek across the Himalayas.
Survive the freezing mists of Scottish moors.
My need to go is hard to fight.
I want to gaze upon this world
Just like the Northern Lights.
And of all the things about you
That I’m going to miss.
It's the bond we’ve formed together
Through this Crimson Kiss.
My son so dear, the world’s out there.
Mystery calls and I can’t resist.
But you and I have memories
Bound together by the Crimson Kiss.
My son so dear, the world’s out there.
Mystery calls and I can’t resist.
But you and I have memories
