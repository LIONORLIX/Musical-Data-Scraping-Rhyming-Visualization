--- LESTAT ---
I'm tired. I am torn.
The cruel light of dawn
Comes now to claim back my soul.
Take me away.
Carry me back to Your home.
GABRIELLE
Rise up my boy.
The night is ours.
Eternity, and all the things we've missed
Could be ours to share forever
Bound together by the crimson kiss.
My son so dear!
The world's out there!
LESTAT & GABRIELLE
Destiny calls!
And we should not resist!
For you and I have memories
