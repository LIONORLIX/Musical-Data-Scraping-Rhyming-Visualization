------ I Want More ------
--- CLAUDIA ---
Don't chastise me, I'm a child
Acting as a child does.
You ply me with lifeless dolls
When what I want is blood.
You took me from the streets to complete this union.
Do you expect some little saint kneeling for communion?
I want more! I want more!
Look at you, you disapprove, like two fussy mothers.
Who are you to criticize the habits of another.
Did I rock the family boat by dining on the help?
Aren't I just a little beast?
Well, I can't stop myself!
I want more! I want more!
I don't want their milk and honey
They can keep those fine herb teas.
I don't need their chocolate hot and sweet.
It's thick and red for me!
For everyone that comes along,
Knocking on this door.
Don't blame me - it's your fault
That I want more!
Louis
My darling, it's not your fault. It's Lestat's.
Lestat
My fault!?
--- Unknown ---
Louis
You're not loving enough to her.
--- Unknown ---
Lestat
I give her everything her black little heart desires, and still she does this!
--- CLAUDIA ---
Look at me, I'm so sweet.
I'm innocent and charming.
But all you see is some spoiled brat
A child so demanding.
Don't fuss so! You both know the rapture of the bite.
It's not monstrous!
It's just Claudia's healthy appetite!
And I want more! I want more!
Should I be the little miss
And while away the hours?
I think not, I'd rather hunt
Than cut up paper flowers.
Thanks to you the things I do verge on the obscene.
What a pair of hypocrites!
Well, this cat wants her cream!
I want more! I want more! I want more!
Lestat
You're too lenient!
Louis
You're too cold!
--- Unknown ---
Lestat
She needs to be punished.
--- Unknown ---
Louis
She needs love and kindness.
--- Unknown ---
I'll wander through the streets at night
And find a charming couple.
Who'd fear that such an angel lost
Could find herself in trouble.
They can't resist my trembling lips
My eyes so filled with tears.
They rest my head upon their necks...
Oh, dear!
More!!
I want more! I want more!
I don't want their milk and honey.
They can keep those fine herb teas.
I don't need their chocolate hot and sweet.
Tt's thick and red for me!
For everyone that comes along,
Knocking on this door.
Don't blame me - it's your fault
That I want more!
I want more!
I want more! I want more!
