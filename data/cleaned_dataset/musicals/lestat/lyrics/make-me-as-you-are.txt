------ Make Me As You Are ------
--- GABRIELLE ---
And from that truth I feel no fear.
Two kinds of death are present here.
Mine's the age-old act of dying
But yours is like the phoenix rising.
Your mother's frail and feeble husk
Will soon be nothing more than dust.
So let's not dwell on wasted years.
My time is short, my choice is clear.
Make me as you are.
Tear the hands off clocks that tick away my final hours.
I want to rage against the light and leave the sun behind.
I want to feel the power of everlasting youth inside.
Take me, give me new life
And we'll live beneath the stars.
Together and forever, I beg you.
Make me as you are.
LESTAT
This cursed gift with which I live.
I know not if it's mine to give.
I'm still a fledgling in this frame.
I've only killed when hunger reigned.
GABRIELLE
The risk is mine and if we fail
I'll shake the Devil by his tail.
Oh blessed thoughts of sweet release
From nagging nurse, and hovering priest.
Make me as you are.
Tear the wings off angels that would lift me from your heart.
I want to dance beneath the moon and slip into the dark.
I want to feel the night awaken when I leave my mark.
Take me, give me new life
And we'll live beneath the stars.
Together and forever, I beg you.
Make me, make me,
Make me as you are.
GABRIELLE & LESTAT
Tear the hands off clocks that tick away my/your final hours.
We'll rage against the light and leave the sun behind.
And feel the power of everlasting youth inside.
GABRIELLE
Take me, give me new life.
GABRIELLE & LESTAT
And we'll live beneath the stars!
Together and forever,
GABRIELLE
I beg you.
