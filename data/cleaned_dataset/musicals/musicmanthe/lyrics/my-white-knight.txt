------ My White Knight ------
--- Unknown ---
(Marian)
My white knight, not a Lancelot, nor an angel with wings
Just someone to love me, who is not ashamed of a few nice things.
My white knight who knew what my heart would say if it only knew how.
Please, dear Venus, show me now.
--- Unknown ---
All I want is a plain man
All I want is a modest man
A quiet man, a gentle man
A straightforward and honest man
To sit with me in a cottage somewhere in the state of Iowa.
--- Unknown ---
And I would like him to be more interested in me than he is in himself.
And more interested in us than in me.
--- Unknown ---
And if occasionally he'd ponder
what make Shakespeare and Beethoven great,
Him I could love till I die. Him I could love till I die.

My white knight, not a Lancelot, nor an angel with wings.
Just someone to love me, who is not ashamed of a few nice things.
My white knight, let me walk with him where others ride by
