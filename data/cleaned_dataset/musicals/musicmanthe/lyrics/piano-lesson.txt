------ Piano Lesson ------
--- Marian ---
Mama, a man with a suitcase followed me home.
--- Mrs. Paroo ---
Oh--Who?
--- Marian ---
I never saw him before.
--- Mrs. Paroo ---
Did he say anythin'?
--- Marian ---
He tried.
--- Mrs. Paroo ---
Did you say anythin'?
--- Marian ---
Of course not, Mama!
Now don't dawdle, Amaryllis.
So do la ti mi,
A little slower and please
Keep the fingers curved as nice
And as high as you possibly can.
Don't get faster,
--- Mrs. Paroo ---
If you don't mind my sayin' so,
It wouldn't have hurt you
To find out what the gentleman wanted.
--- Marian ---
I know what the gentleman wanted.
--- Mrs. Paroo ---
What, dear?
--- Marian ---
You'll find it in Balzac.
--- Mrs. Paroo ---
Excuse me fer livin' but I never read it.
--- Marian ---
Neither has anyone else in this town.
--- Mrs. Paroo ---
There you go again with the same old comment
About the low mentality of River City people,
And takin' it all to much to heart.
--- Marian ---
Now, Mama,
As long as the Madison Public Library was entrusted
To me for the purpose of improving River City's cultural level,
I can't help my concern that the Ladies of River City
Keep ignoring all my council and advice.
--- Mrs. Paroo ---
But, darlin'--when a woman has a husband
And you've got none,
Why should she take advice from you?
Even if you can quote Balzac and Shakespeare
And all them other highfalutin' Greeks.
--- Marian ---
Momma, if you don't mind my sayin' so,
You have a bad habit of changin' ev'ry subject--
--- Mrs. Paroo ---
Well, I haven't changed the subject!
I was talking about that stranger--
--- Marian ---
What stranger?
--- Mrs. Paroo ---
With the suitcase who may be your very last chance.
--- Marian ---
Mama!
Do you think that I'd allow a common masher--
Now, really Mama!
I have my standards where men are concerned,
And I have no intention--
--- Mrs. Paroo ---
I know all about your standards
And if you don't mind my sayin' so
There's not a man alive
Who could hope to measure up to that blend'a
Paul Bunyan, Saint Pat and Noah Webster
You've got concocted for yourself outta your Irish imagination,
