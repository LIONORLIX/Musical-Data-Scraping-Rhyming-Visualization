------ Sincere ------
--- Quartet ---
How can there be any sin in sincere
Where is the good in goodbye?
Your apprehensions confuse me dear
Puzzle and mystify (Mystify)
Tell me what can be fair in farewell, dear
While one single star shines above
How can there be any sin in sincere?
Aren't we sincerely in love?
