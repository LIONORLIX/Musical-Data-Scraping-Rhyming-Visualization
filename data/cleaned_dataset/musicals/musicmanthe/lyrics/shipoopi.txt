Well a woman who'll kiss on the very first date
Is usually a hussy.
And a woman who'll kiss on the second time out
Is anything but fussy.
But a woman who waits 'til the third time around,
Head in the clouds, feet on the ground!
She's the girl he's glad he's found--she's his
Shi-Poo-Pi! Shi-Poo-Pi! Shi-Poo-Pi! Shi-Poo-Pi!
--- Boys ---
The girl who's hard to get!
--- Marcellus ---
Shi-Poo-Pi!
Shi-Poo-Pi
Shi-Poo-Pi
--- Girls ---
But you can win her yet.
--- Marcellus ---
Walk her once just to raise the curtain,
Walk around twice and you make for certain.
Once more in the flower garden,
She will never get sore
If you beg her pardon.
--- All ---
Do re me fa so la si
Do si la sol fa mi re do
--- Marcellus ---
Squeeze her once when she isn't lookin',
If you get a squeeze back, that's fancy cookin',
Once more for a pepper-upper,
She will never get sore on her way to supper.
--- All ---
Do re me fa sol la si
Do si do
--- Marcellus ---
Shi-Poo-Pi!
Shi-Poo-Pi!
Shi-Poo-Pi!
--- Boys ---
The girl who's hard to get.
--- Marcellus ---
Shi-Poo-Pi!
Shi-Poo-Pi!
Shi-Poo-Pi!
--- Girls ---
But you can win her yet.
--- All ---
Shi-Poo-Pi, Shi-Poo-Pi, Shi-Poo-Pi!
The girl who's hard to get.
Shi-Poo-Pi,
Shi-Poo-Pi, Shi-Poo-Pi, but you can win her yet.
You can win her yet!
