------ Get Me to the Church on Time ------
--- Unknown ---
Jamie, Harry, Friends There's just a few more hours.
That's all the time you've got. A few more hours
Before they tie the knot. Doolittle
There are drinks and girls all over London,
and I've gotta track 'em down in just a few more hours!
I'm getting married in the morning! Ding dong!
The bells are gonna chime. Pull out the stopper!
Let's have a whopper! But get me to the church on time!
I gotta be there in the mornin'
Spruced up and lookin' in me prime.
Girls, come and kiss me;
Show how you'll miss me.
But get me to the church on time!
If I am dancin' Roll up the floor.
If I am whistlin' Whewt me out the door!
For I'm gettin' married in the mornin'
Ding dong! the bells are gonna chime.
Kick up an rumpus But don't lost the compass;
And get me to the church, Get me to the church,
For Gawd's sake, get me to the church on time!
Doolittle and Everyone I'm getting married in the morning
Ding dong! the bells are gonna chime.
Doolittle Drug me or jail me, Stamp me and mail me.
All But get me to the church on time!
I gotta be there in the morning
Spruced up and lookin' in me prime.
Doolittle Some bloke who's able Lift up the table,
All And get em to the church on time!
Doolittle If I am flying Then shoot me down.
If I am wooin',
Get her out of town!
All For I'm getting married in the morning!
Ding dong! the bells are gonna chime.
Doolittle Feather and tar me;
Call out the Army; But get me to the church.
All Get me to the church...
Doolittle For Gawd's sake, get me to the church on time!
Harry and Everyone Starlight is reelin' home to bed now.
Mornin' is smearin' up the sky. London is wakin'.
Daylight is breakin'. Good luck, old chum,
Good health, goodbye.
Doolittle I'm gettin' married in the mornin'
Ding dong! the bells are gonna chime...
Hail and salute me Then haul off and boot me...
And get me to the church, Get me to the church...
