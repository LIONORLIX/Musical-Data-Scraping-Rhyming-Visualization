--- Genie ---
So it goes, short a sweet,
Now they live down the street
Doing just what they all do best.
--- Unknown ---
Laws get changed, just in time
And for them no more crime
As for Genie, a well earned rest!
--- Unknown ---
It's the plot that you knew
With a small twist or two
But the changes we made were slight
--- Unknown ---
So shalom worthy friend
Come back soon, that's the end!
'Til another Arabian Night.
--- Aladdin and Jasmine ---
A whole new world!
A new fantastic point of view
No one to tell us no, or where to go
Or say we're only dreaming
--- Cast ---
A whole new world
With new horizons to pursue
I'll chase them anywhere
There's time to spare
Let me share this whole new world
With you.
--- Genie ---
A whole new world
That's where I'll be
--- Cast ---
A thrilling chase, a wondrous place
--- Genie ---
I just love a happy ending!
