------ Arabian Nights ------
--- Unknown ---
Oh I come from a land, from a faraway place
Where the caravan camels roam
Where they cut off your ear
If they don't like your face
It's barbaric, but hey, it's home }
--- Unknown ---
When the wind's from the east
And the sun's from the west
And the sand in the glass is right
Come on down
Stop on by
Hop a carpet and fly
To another Arabian night
--- Unknown ---
Arabian nights
Like Arabian days
More often than not
Are hotter than hot
In a lot of good ways
--- Unknown ---
Arabian nights
'Neath Arabian moons
A fool off his guard
Could fall and fall hard
