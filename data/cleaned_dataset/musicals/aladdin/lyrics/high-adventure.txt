--- Unknown ---
Convince those guys, my lord and master
Well, do it faster, let's be gone
In wasting time we court disaster
Pick up that sword and strap it on
--- Unknown ---
Fate blows her kiss
Chills your heart
Takes your hand
--- Unknown ---
Fate feels like this
Play your part
This was planned
--- Unknown ---
And lo, before you know
You grab your horse, you grab your gear
Your moment's now, your moment's here
--- Unknown ---
It's time for high adventure
You're off and riding, sabre flashing
Your banner high, your molars gnashing
--- Unknown ---
You feel so dashing on a high adventure
Get set to give some guy a thrashing
'Cause high adventure's in the air
--- Unknown ---
There's high adventure in the air, guys
Someone's out there, guys, someone bad
He's got a damsel in despair, guys
Heck, that's not fair, guys, and I'm mad
--- Unknown ---
Fate blows her kiss
Winks her eye
Plots her scheme
Plots it for Babkak, Omar, and Kassim
--- Unknown ---
And so
We three will go
Until it's through
Until it ends
Here comes Aladdin's only friends
Off on a
High adventure
--- Unknown ---
To confrontations so exciting
They're playing music while we're fighting
Sctatching and biting on a
High adventure
Feel that adrenaline igniting
'Cause high adventure's in the air
--- Unknown ---
adventure
Heigh-ho, the stallions are stampeding
With Allah's wisdom ever leading
My finger's bleeding! Well, that's
High adventure
What we've collectively been needing
Is high adventure in the air
--- Unknown ---
Hark! Something calls like a dream from afar
Calls out to Babkak, Kassim and Omar
It's - wait! - the voice of fate
It calls to me, it calls to you
And to, Aladdin's muttley crew,
It's time for high adventure
--- Unknown ---
Danger to danger we go flying
Completely unafraid of dying
Omar, stop crying, this is
High adventure
--- Unknown ---
There's no ignoring or denying
The kind of thrills that it's supplying
And the effect's electrifying
