------ These Palace Walls ------
--- JASMINE ---
(Spoken) A princess must say this.
A princess must marry a total stranger, its absurd!
--- Unknown ---
(Sung) Suitors talk of love, but it’s an act
Merely meant to throw me
How can someone love me when, in fact
They don’t know me’
--- Unknown ---
They want my royal treasure,
When all is said and done.
It’s time for a desperate measure
So I wonder
--- Unknown ---
Why shouldn’t I fly so far from here?
I know the girl I might become here
Sad and confined
And always locked behind these palace walls
--- Unknown ---
LADY #1
(Spoken) I don't know princess...for someone like you the outside world might be, kinda overwhelming
--- JASMINE ---
(Spoken) Is that a promise?
--- Unknown ---
LADY #2
(Spoken) I think it'd do her some good!
--- JASMINE ---
(Spoken) You do?
--- Unknown ---
LADY #2
(Spoken) Honey I've never seen somebody who needed to get out more!
--- LADIES ---
Told to show devotion every day
And not second guess it
--- JASMINE ---
If a new emotion comes my way
--- LADIES ---
You suppress it
--- JASMINE ---
What would be your suggestion?
--- LADIES ---
Stand on your own two feet
And ask why a certain question keeps repeating
--- JASMINE ---
Why shouldn’t I fly so far from here?
I know the girl I might become here
Follow your heart or you might end up cold and callous
--- ALL ---
Love comes to those who go and find it
If you've a dream then stand behind it
--- JASMINE ---
Maybe there’s more beyond these palace walls
What if I dared?
What if I tried?
Am I prepared for what’s outside?
--- Unknown ---
Why shouldn’t I fly so far from here?
Something awaits beyond these palace walls
--- ALL ---
Something waits beyond these palace walls
