------ Somebody's Got Your Back ------
--- Unknown ---
(Genie)
As a Teeny Genie Blue
I would dare to dream
I'd be given freedom free and clear
So forgive me if I sing
Or make a whole big thing
But I just can't maintain my cool veneer
--- Unknown ---
You don't mind if I squeal do you?
Be my guest!
Oooooh! I can't believe this is actually happening!
Well
--- Unknown ---
(Aladdin)
You save me
Then I'll save you
I won't bail a 23 Skidoo
Say ain't it great to know somebody's got your back
--- Unknown ---
(Genie)
I'll free you in one second,
I wanna sing this one little verse:
That I owe you
That you owe me
Means we're Ollie Ollie Oxen Free!
Say ain't it great to know that somebody's got your back!
--- Unknown ---
(Both)
Ooooooh!
I always knew that I could trust you kid
Ooooooh!
It's squid pro-quo then it's quo-pro-quid!
--- Unknown ---
(Genie)
I knew you'd see that fair is fair
Cross my heart and double pinky swear
Say ain't it great to know that somebody's got your back
Say ain't it great to know that somebody's got your back!
--- Unknown ---
(Genie)
No, after you
Sure I'll take it
--- Unknown ---
-Music break-
--- Unknown ---
Hello?
--- Unknown ---
(All)
Alright!
Ooooooh!
Without Genie, we don't stand a chance!
Ooooooh!
This is the start of a fine bromance!
--- Unknown ---
Our bond will last like Mutt and Jeff's
OMG the guys are BFFs!
Say ain't it great to know that somebody's got your back!
--- Unknown ---
It's give and take!
It takes some tact
We gonna divvy things up
I down with that
If Poof, Ka-Blam
Comes easily
It's part of Genie Genie-ology!
--- Unknown ---
We don't do tricks
Like Genies do
But we got your back
And sing back up too!
Sayin' ain't it great to know that somebody's got your
Ain't it great to know that somebody's got your
Ain't it great to know that somebody's got your
Baaaack!
