Ba-badabada
Ba-badabada

[Over the top] There's no question this Ali's impressive
Ba-badabada
Though, his entourage might be excessive
Ba-badabada
All those elephants at once can quite unnerve one
Ba-badabada
Still, the man gives a parade new meaning
And the sight of all those peacocks preening
He's a prince without a peer
And we deserve one!
--- Unknown ---
There's no question this Ali's alluring                     Prince Ali, fabulous he
Never ordinary!                                                       Ali Abwabwa
Never boring!                                                          That physique!
Everything about the man just plain impresses      How can I speak?
He's a winner, he's a wizz                                       I'm weak at the knee
A wonder!                                                                Well get on out in that square
He's about to put my heart asunder                       Adjust your veil and prepare
And I absolutely love the way he dresses               To gawk and grovel and stare
At Prince Ali!
--- Unknown ---
He's got ninety-five white Persian monkeys
And to view them he charges no fee
He's got slaves, he's got servants and flunkies
They bow to his whim (love serving him)
They're just lousy with loyalty to Ali!
Prince Ali!
--- Unknown ---
Prince Ali!
Amorous he!
Ali Ababwa
Heard your princess was a sight (ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
Lovely to see
And that, good people, is why
He got dolled up and dropped by
With sixty elephants, llamas galore
With his bears and lions
A brass band and more
With his forty fakirs, his cooks, his bakers
His birds that warble on key
Make way for prince...
Prince Ali!
--- Unknown ---
Say hey to prince Ali! (Prince Ali)
Say hey, hey, hey to prince ali!
Badabadaba bow!
