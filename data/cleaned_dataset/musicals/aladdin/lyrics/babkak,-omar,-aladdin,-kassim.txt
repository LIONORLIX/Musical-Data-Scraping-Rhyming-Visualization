--- Unknown ---
A good pals, blood brothers
Me and three others
Babkak, Omar, Aladdin, Kassim
--- Unknown ---
Four friends, none closer
Get mad? Heck no, sir!
Not us, four-strong, a permanent team
--- Unknown ---
Four guys out poundin'
The pavements of Agraba
Poor guys with one Alabian dream
--- Unknown ---
To stay this lazy
And play like crazy
Babkak, Omar, Aladdin, Kassim
--- Unknown ---
True friends, no phonies
Me and my cronies
Babkak, Omar, Aladdin, Kassim
--- Unknown ---
Four bums, none better
Not one, go-getter
Unmontivated in the extreme
--- Unknown ---
Folks say, "Hey, go earn a living in Agraba!
Grow up, go earn the city's esteem!
We say, Tough noogie!
No way! Let's boogie!
Babkak, Omar, Aladdin, Kassim
--- Unknown ---
Four guys out passing the turban in Agraba
For lettring off some musical stream
That's our finale
--- Unknown ---
'Kay guys, let's blow this alley
Babkak, Omar, Aladdin and
How's that so far? Not bad!
It's eight eyes with one impermanent gleam
--- Unknown ---
