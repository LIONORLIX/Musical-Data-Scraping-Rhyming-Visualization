------ Proud of Your Boy (Reprise I) ------
--- Unknown ---
I Know That I...
Was A Louse
And A Loafer...
You Won't Get A Fight,
I Agree...
--- Unknown ---
I was a bold brick,
A Goof-Off, No Good
So How Did This Happen To Me?
--- Unknown ---
Proud Of Your Boy...
I Hope Your Proud Of Your Boy...
--- Unknown ---
Cause' I Don't Feel Any Taller
Or Smarter
Or Handsome or Wise...
--- Unknown ---
And Now I Know What I Have To Do...
How Can I Be A Prince? When It Isn't True!
--- Unknown ---
So I Will Try To Try Hard
To Make You Proud
--- Unknown ---
Of Your Boy...
