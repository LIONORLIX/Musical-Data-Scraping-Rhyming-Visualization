------ Doubt Comes In ------
--- FATES ---
Doubt comes in
And strips the paint
Doubt comes in
And turns the wine
Doubt comes in and leaves a trace
Of vinegar and turpentine
--- FATES and ORPHEUS ---
Where are you?
Where are you now?
--- FATES ---
Doubt comes in
And kills the lights
Doubt comes in
And chills the air
--- ORPHEUS ---
Doubt comes in and all falls silent
It’s as though you aren’t there
--- FATES and ORPHEUS ---
Where are you?
Where are you now?
--- EURYDICE ---
Orpheus,
You’re shivering
Is it cold or fear?
Just keep singing
The coldest night
Of the coldest year
Comes right before the spring
--- FATES ---
Doubt comes in
With tricky fingers
Doubt comes in
With fickle tongues
--- ORPHEUS ---
Doubt comes in and my heart falters
And forgets the songs it sung
--- FATES and ORPHEUS ---
Where are you?
Where are you now?
--- EURYDICE ---
Orpheus,
Hold on, hold on tight
It won’t be long
’cause the darkest hour
Of the darkest night
------ fin ------
