------ Promises ------
--- EURYDICE ---
Promises you made to me
You said the rivers and the trees
Would fill our pockets and our plates
Promises you made
You said the birds would blanket us
You said the world was generous
And wouldn’t turn its back on us
--- Unknown ---
The river froze, the trees were bare
And all the birds, they disappeared
So me too, I flew away
From promises you made
--- ORPHEUS ---
Promises you made to me
You said that you would stay with me
Whatever weather came our way
Promises you made
That we would walk, side by side
Through all the seasons of our lives
'Neath any sky, down any road
Any way the wind blows
--- Unknown ---
I have no ring for your finger
I have no banquet table laid
I have no bed of feathers
Whatever promises I’ve made
Can’t promise you fair sky above
Can’t promise you kind road below
But I’ll walk with you, my love
Any way the wind blows
--- EURYDICE ---
I don’t need gold, don’t need silver
Just bread when I’m hungry, fire when I’m cold
Don’t need a ring for my finger
Just need a steady hand to hold
Don’t promise me fair sky above
Don’t promise me kind road below
Just walk with me, my love
Any way the wind blows
--- ORPHEUS ---
I don’t know where this road will end
But I’ll walk with you into the wind
--- BOTH ---
I can’t promise you fair sky above
Can’t promise you kind road below
But I’ll walk with you, my love
Any way the wind blows
--- ORPHEUS ---
Do you let me walk with you?
--- EURYDICE ---
I do
--- ORPHEUS ---
I do
--- BOTH ---
I do
--- EURYDICE ---
And keep on walking, come what will?
--- ORPHEUS ---
I will
--- EURYDICE ---
I will
--- BOTH ---
We will
