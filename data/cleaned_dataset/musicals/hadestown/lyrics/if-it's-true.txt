------ If It's True ------
--- ORPHEUS ---
If it’s true what they say
If my love is gone for good
They can take this heart away
They can take this flesh and blood
Take my mouth that kissed her mouth
Take my tongue that sung her praise
Take my arms that used to reach out
In the dark to where she lay
--- Unknown ---
If it’s true what they say
I’ll be on my way
--- Unknown ---
If it’s true what they say
If there’s nothing to be done
If there’s no part to be played
If there’s no song to be sung
--- Unknown ---
Take this voice, take these hands
I can’t use them anyway
Take this music and the memory
Of the muse from which it came
--- Unknown ---
If it’s true what they say
I’ll be on my way
We can all be on our way
If it’s true what they say
--- HERMES, spoken ---
Persephone heard that poor boy sing,
And it broke her heart in two.
She went to go find that mighty King and see what she could do.
And the boy- well, the boy kept singing loud and clear,
'Cause everybody knows that the walls have ears.

But the ones who tell the lies
Are the solemnest to swear
And the ones who load the dice
Always say the toss is fair
And the ones who deal the cards
--- FATES ---
Deal the cards...
--- ORPHEUS ---
Are the ones who take the tricks
With their hands over their hearts
While we play the games they fix
And the ones who speak the words
--- FATES ---
Speak the words...
--- ORPHEUS ---
Always say it is the last
And no answer will be heard
To the question no one asks
--- Unknown ---
So I ask you as a brother
And I ask you as a friend
And I ask you as a lover
And I ask you once again,
