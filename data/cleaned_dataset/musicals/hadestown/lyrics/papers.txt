You're not from around here, son. Don't know who the hell you are but I can tell you don't belong.

--- HADES, spoken ---
You hear me, son?

And Hades was a mighty king.

You better run!

Who the hell do you think you're talking to?

You're not from around here, son. If you were, then you would know that everyone and everything in Hadestown, I own.
