Come home with me!
--- EURYDICE, spoken ---
Who are you?
--- ORPHEUS, spoken ---
The man who’s gonna marry you. I’m Orpheus.
Come home with me!
--- EURYDICE, spoken ---
Who am I?
--- ORPHEUS, spoken ---
Eurydice —
--- Unknown ---
(sung)
— the girl who makes me wanna sing
--- Unknown ---
(spoken)
The woman who I’m marrying.
--- EURYDICE, spoken ---
A singer! Is that what you are?
--- ORPHEUS, spoken ---
Well, I also play the lyre.
--- EURYDICE, spoken ---
Oh, a liar! And a player too?
I’ve met too many men like you.
--- ORPHEUS, spoken ---
I’m not like any man you’ve met.
--- EURYDICE, spoken ---
Oh yeah? What makes you different?
--- ORPHEUS, spoken ---
You see the world?
--- EURYDICE, spoken ---
Of course I do.
--- ORPHEUS, spoken ---
I’ll make it beautiful for you. For you I’ll change the way it is.
--- EURYDICE, spoken ---
With what?
--- ORPHEUS, spoken ---
With this!
--- EURYDICE, spoken ---
I’m sure you play it well, but only the gods can change the world. Me and you can’t change a thing.
--- ORPHEUS, spoken ---
You haven’t heard me sing.
--- EURYDICE, spoken ---
Are you always this confident?
--- ORPHEUS, spoken ---
When I look at you I am.
--- EURYDICE, spoken ---
When you look at me, what do you see?
--- ORPHEUS, spoken ---
Someone stronger than me, somebody who survives.
--- EURYDICE, spoken ---
So why should I become your wife?
--- ORPHEUS, spoken ---
Because I make you feel alive.
--- EURYDICE, spoken ---
That’s worth a lot...
What else you got?
