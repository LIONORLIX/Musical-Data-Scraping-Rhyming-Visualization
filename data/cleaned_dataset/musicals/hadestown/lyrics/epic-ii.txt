Miners of mines, diggers of graves
They bowed down to Hades who gave them work
--- Unknown ---
And they bowed down to Hades who made them sweat
Who paid them their wages and set them about
Digging and dredging and dragging the depths of the earth
To turn its insides out, singing:

And a million feet that fell in line
That stepped in time with Hades’ step
And a million minds that were just one mind
Like stones in a row,
And stone by stone,
Row by row,
The river rose up, singing:
La la la la la la la…
