------ Any Way the Wind Blows ------
--- FATES ---
In the fever of a world in flames
In the season of the hurricanes
Flood will get you if the fire don’t
Any way the wind blows
--- Unknown ---
And there ain’t a thing that you can do
When the weather takes a turn on you
‘Cept for hurry up and hit the road
Any way the wind blows
--- Unknown ---
Sister's gone, gone the gypsy route
Brother's gone, gone for a job down south
Ain’t nobody gonna stick around
When the dark clouds roll
Any way the wind blows
--- Unknown ---
In the valley of the exodus
In the belly of a bowl of dust
Crows and buzzards flying low
Any way the wind blows
--- Unknown ---
No use talking of the past, it’s passed
Set out walking and you don’t look back
Where you’re goin’ there ain’t no one knows
Any way the wind blows
--- Unknown ---
Sister's gone, gone the gypsy route
Brother's gone, gone for a job down south
Gone the same way as the shantytown
And the traveling show
