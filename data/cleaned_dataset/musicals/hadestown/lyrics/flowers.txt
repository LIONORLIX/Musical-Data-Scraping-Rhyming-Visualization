------ Flowers ------
--- EURYDICE ---
What I wanted was to fall asleep
Close my eyes and disappear
Like a petal on a stream,
A feather on the air
--- Unknown ---
Lily white and poppy red
I trembled when he laid me out
You won’t feel a thing, he said, when you go down
--- Unknown ---
Nothing gonna wake you now...
--- Unknown ---
Dreams are sweet until they’re not
Men are kind until they aren’t
Flowers bloom until they rot and fall apart
--- Unknown ---
Is anybody listening?
I open my mouth
And nothing comes out
Nothing, nothing gonna wake me now
--- Unknown ---
Flowers
I remember fields
Of flowers
Soft beneath my heels
Walking in the sun
I remember someone
Someone by my side
Turned his face to mine
And then I turned away
Into the shade
--- Unknown ---
You, the one I left behind
If you ever walk this way
Come and find me
Lying in the bed I made
