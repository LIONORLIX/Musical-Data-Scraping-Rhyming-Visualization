------ Nothing Changes ------
--- FATES ---
Why the struggle, why the strain?
Why make trouble? Why make scenes?
Why go against the grain?
Why swim upstream?
--- Unknown ---
It ain’t, it ain’t, it ain’t no use
You’re bound, you’re bound, you’re bound to lose
What’s done, what’s done, what’s done is done
That’s the way the river runs
--- Unknown ---
So why get wet? Why break a sweat?
Why waste your precious breath?
Why beat your handsome brow?
Nothing changes
Nothing changes
Nothing changes anyhow
