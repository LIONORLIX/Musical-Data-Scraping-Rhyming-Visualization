------ Road to Hell II ------
--- HERMES ---
[mumbles and sighs]
Alright, alright
It’s an old song
It’s an old tale from way back when
It’s an old song
And we’re gonna sing it again and again
--- Unknown ---
We’re gonna sing it again
--- Unknown ---
There was a railroad line on a road to Hell
There was a young man down on bended knee
And that is the ending of the tale
Of Orpheus and Eurydice
--- Unknown ---
It’s a sad song
It’s a sad tale, it’s a tragedy
It’s a sad song
But we sing it anyway
--- sighs ---
[spoken]
Cause, here’s the thing:
To know how it ends
And still begin to sing it again
As if it might turn out this time
I learned that from a friend of mine
--- Unknown ---
See, Orpheus was a poor boy
But he had a gift to give:
He could make you see how the world could be,
In spite of the way that it is
--- Unknown ---
Can you see it?
Can you hear it?
Can you feel it like a train?
Is it coming?
Is it coming this a-way?
--- sung ---
On a sunny day there was a railroad car
And a lady stepping off a train
Everybody looked and everybody saw
That spring had come again
--- Unknown ---
With a love song
With a tale of a love that never dies
With a love song
