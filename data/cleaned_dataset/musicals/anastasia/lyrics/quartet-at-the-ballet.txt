------ Quartet at the Ballet ------
--- ANYA ---
Can this be the evening
Can this be the place
Am I only dreaming
Looking at her face
Everything I wanted
Suddenly so clear
My past and my future so near
--- DMITRY ---
Next to me this frightened girl
Holding tight as the dancers whirl
Keep your nerve and see this through
It’s what you’ve come to do
--- DOWAGER EMPRESS ---
See that girl
Could it be
Don’t be ridiculous
I refuse to dream
I refuse to hope
I must stop believing
I will never find her
--- GLEB ---
She’s near at hand
Yet here I stand
My heard and mind at war
The times must change
The world must change
And love is not what revolution’s for
--- DMITRY & GLEB ---
Someone holds her safe and warm
Someone rescues her from the storm
Simple things but one thing’s clear:
It’s fate that brought us here
--- ANYA &                               DMITRY                   GLEB ---
