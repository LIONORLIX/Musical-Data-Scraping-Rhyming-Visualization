------ Crossing a Bridge ------
--- Unknown ---
Look at the sky
Look at the water
Somebody's bridge
Somebody's daughter
Who could've known I'd be alone
Crossing this bridge
--- Unknown ---
Boats heading in
Somebody calling
Sun going down
Shadows are falling
Shimmering view
Dangerous, too,
Crossing a bridge
--- Unknown ---
Halfway between
Where I've been
And where I'm going
In between wondering why
And finally knowing
--- Unknown ---
Thousands of lights
Shining below me
Somebody waits
Somebody, know me
--- Unknown ---
Maybe we're sharing
This beautiful night
Me on the left bank
You on the right
Almost in sight...
Crossing a bridge
--- Unknown ---
Every light is like a promise
Every light could be a clue
One of them might be you
