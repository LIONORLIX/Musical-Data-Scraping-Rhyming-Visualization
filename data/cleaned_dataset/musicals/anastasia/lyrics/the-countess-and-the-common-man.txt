------ The Countess and the Common Man ------
--- VLAD ---
(spoken) Ever since that first day I saw you at court, I knew I was beneath you.
--- LILY ---
(spoken) You were right, darling. You were.
--- BLAD ---
I noticed you across a room-
The most exquisite rose.
The tiniest tiara and
That haughty little nose.
I flirted with you shamelessly.
--- LILY ---
Or so the scandal goes...
The Countess
--- VLAD ---
And the common man.
We tiptoes off to Peterhof
To have a royal fling.
--- LILY ---
My husband was oblivious;
Count's never know a thing!
--- VLAD ---
And all of it was perfect...
--- LILY ---
'Till you stole my diamond ring!
--- BOTH ---
The countess
And the common man.
--- VLAD ---
Cologne in the bedclothes,
The pastry and wine.
--- LILY ---
And under the table
Your foot touching mine.
--- BOTH ---
And how my heart beat
When you sent me our sign.
--- LILY ---
I loved you...
--- VLAD ---
You loved me
And oh, it was simply
--- BOTH ---
Divine.
--- VLAD ---
Who would have known.
My little rose,
We're back where we began.
--- LILY ---
And I suppose
That you'll propose
Another sneaky plan!
Which I'll resist...
--- VLAD ---
Until you're kissed...
--- BOTH ---
For nothing's better than...
--- LILY ---
The countess
--- VLAD ---
And the common man
--- BOTH ---
The countess
And the common man.
