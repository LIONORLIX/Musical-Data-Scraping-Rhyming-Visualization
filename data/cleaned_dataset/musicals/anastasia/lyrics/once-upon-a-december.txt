------ Once Upon a December ------
--- Unknown ---
Dancing bears,
Painted wings,
Things I almost remember,
And a song someone sings
Once upon a December.
--- Unknown ---
Someone holds me safe and warm.
Horses prance through a silver storm.
Figures dancing gracefully
Across my memory...

Someone holds me safe and warm.
Horses prance through a silver storm.
Figures dancing gracefully
Across my memory...
--- Unknown ---
Far away, long ago,
Glowing dim as an ember,
Things my heart
Used to know,
Things it yearns to remember...
--- Unknown ---
And a song
Someone sings
Once upon a December
