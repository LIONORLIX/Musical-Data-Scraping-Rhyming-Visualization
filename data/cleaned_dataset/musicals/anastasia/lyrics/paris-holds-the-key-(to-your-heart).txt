(Vlad)
Voilà!
Mes amis, here’s Paris.
Now that we’re here, follow me.
Begin with the new
As you stroll down la rue.
--- Unknown ---
(Vlad & Ensemble)
And soon all Paris
Will be singing to you.
--- Unknown ---
Paris holds the key to your heart
And all of Paris plays a part.
Paris’ turned a page
To the new modern age.
--- Unknown ---
(Vlad)
And we’ll do it too if we’re smart!
--- Unknown ---
(Ensemble)
The French have it down to an art.
--- Unknown ---
Everyone’s a writer, painter, poet.
Everything is avant garde
Or chic.
--- Unknown ---
(Vlad)
We’ll be in the know
Before we know it.
--- Unknown ---
(Vlad & Ensemble)
When you’re in the know it’s-
Oh, it’s magnifique
To find in Paris what you seek.
--- Unknown ---
(Dmitry)
Paris holds the key to her fate.
We won’t have much longer to wait
And then come what may
We will each go our way…

(Anya)
I dreamed of a city beyond all compare
It’s hard to believe that I’m finally there.
--- Unknown ---
(Vlad)
At last, there’s a future.
--- Unknown ---
(Dmitry)
There’s freedom.
--- Unknown ---
(Anya)
There’s hope.
--- Unknown ---
(Vlad, Dmitry & Anya)
In the air!

(All)
Paris holds the key to your heart
The pleasures of life à la carte
Come dance through the night
And forget all your woes
The city of light
How it glitters and glows
And one never knows what will start
Paris holds the key to your heart!
