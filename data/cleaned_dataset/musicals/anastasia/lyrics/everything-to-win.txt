------ Everything to Win ------
--- DMITRY ---
What are they saying?
Wonder how long they'll be?
Why should I worry?
Worrying's not like me!
--- Unknown ---
Nothing to do
But pace and stew
And wait till the girl walks in...
Why panic now
With everything to win?
--- Unknown ---
Nothing but silence.
This could be bad, but
No! Let's assume it's good.
Thought it was foolproof.
Nothing is foolproof!
Whoa! Better knock on wood!
--- Unknown ---
Girl gets a family,
Boy gets rich!
And fairytale gets a spin!
How can we fail
With everything to win!
--- Unknown ---
I wonder
If our paths
Will ever cross again
The way they
Did when you were eight
And I was ten.
--- Unknown ---
We said this was goodbye,
But even so
You never know.
You never know...
--- Unknown ---
I should be glad that
We're breaking free, but
Nothing is what it was.
I didn't know
She mattered to me, but
Now I can see she does...
--- Unknown ---
Con man and princess
Get their wish and
Fairytale comes true!
Funny, the one small part
I never knew...
With everything to win
The only thing I lose
Is you.
