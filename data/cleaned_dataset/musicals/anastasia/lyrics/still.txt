------ Still ------
--- Unknown ---
An underhanded girl
An act of desperation
And to my consternation
I let her go...
She wants what she can get-
Is that a fair depiction?
Does she believe her fiction?
It's hard to know...
Is it innocence or guile?
Or nothing but a childish act of will?
She doesn't know she needs you
She willfully misleads you
But still....still...!
--- Unknown ---
A son becomes a man!
At his father's knee
If my father asked questions
Well...where would we be?
--- Unknown ---
She's nothing but a child.
A waif who needs protection
I feel a strange connection-
I can't allow!
--- Unknown ---
She says it's all a game
She trembles like a flower
But in her, there's a power
I see that now!
--- Unknown ---
I am nothing but a man!
With nothing but his orders
To fulfill!
I'm innocent! She cries!
But then, you see her eyes
And something in them tells you
That she absolutely lies!
--- Unknown ---
Until your heart replies....
But, still...!
Still....
Still!
