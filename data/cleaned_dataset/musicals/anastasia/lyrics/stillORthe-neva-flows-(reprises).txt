------ Still/The Neva Flows (Reprises) ------
--- Gleb ---
My father shook his head told me not to ask
My mother said he died of shame
--- Anastasia ---
In me you see them, look at their faces in mine,
Hear their screams, imagine their terror, see their blood!
--- Gleb ---
But I believe he did a proud and vital task
And in my father's name...
--- Anastasia ---
Do it and I will be with my parents and my brother
And sisters in that cellar in Ekaterinburg all over again
--- Gleb ---
The children, their voices. A man makes painful choices
He does what's necessary, Anya!
For Russia, my beauty. What choice but simple duty?
We have the past to bury, Anya!
--- Ensemble ---
The Neva flows, a new wind blows
--- Gleb and ensemble ---
And soon it will be spring. The leaves unfold, the Tsar lies cold!
--- Gleb ---
Be careful what a dream may bring. A revolution is a simple thing!
