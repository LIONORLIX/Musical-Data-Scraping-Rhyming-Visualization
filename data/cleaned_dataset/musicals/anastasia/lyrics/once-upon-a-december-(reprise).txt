--- Anya (spoken) ---
Do you remember the last time you saw Anastasia? You were leaving for Paris.
You never came back. You gave her a music box. I believe this was it.

Far away,
Long ago,
Glowing dim as an ember
--- Dowager Empress ---
Things my heart
Used to know
--- Anya and Dowager Empress ---
Once upon a December.
--- Dowager Empress (spoken) ---
Anastasia!
