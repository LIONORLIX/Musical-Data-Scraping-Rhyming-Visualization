------ Close the Door ------
--- DOWAGER ---
These strangers, come calling
Soon enough they're gone.
The twilight is falling, lamps will soon go on
And where did summer go I will never know summer used to last endlessly
Children all in white, running down the sand
To me
To me.
--- Unknown ---
These strangers, sent packing
What do they expect.
So grasping,
So lacking
Why not be direct.
The beating of my heart,
After they depart
Lying wide awake,
Through the night
Will you ever come,
Running home to me
You might
You might.
--- Unknown ---
I've believed so long,
I have dared to hope
That the door might open,
And that you might
Enter.
--- SUNG DOWAGER ---
Playing hide and seek.
Kisses on my cheek.
The lamps begin to glow,
In my heart I know,
You're a lie that I've waited for.
Tell them all to go.
Tell them all no more.
Tell them I close the door.
