------ A Rumor in St Petersburg ------
--- Ensemble ---
The Neva flows, a new wind blows and soon it will be spring.
--- Unknown ---
GLEB (spoken)
We hear you comrades. The revolution hears you.
Together we will forge a new Russia, that will be the envy of all the world.
The Tsar’s St Petersburg is now the people’s Leningrad.
--- Unknown ---
DMITRY (spoken)
They can call it Leningrad, but it’ll always be Petersburg. New name same empty stomachs.
They tell us times are better
Well I say they're not
Can’t cook an empty promise
In an empty pot
A brighter day is dawning
It’s almost at hand
The skies are grey, the walls have ears and he who argues disappears.
--- DMITRY & ENSEMBLE ---
Hail our great new land
--- Unknown ---
Ensemble
St. Petersburg is gloomy, a city on the rise.

MAN 2
We stand behind our leaders

And stand in line for bread
--- ENSEMBLE ---
We’re good and loyal comrades
And our favorite color’s red
--- DMITRY ---
Now everyone is equal
Professors push the brooms
--- DMITRY & ENSEMBLE ---
Two dozen total strangers
Live in two small rooms
You hold a revolution
And here’s the price you pay
--- ENSEMBLE ---
Thank goodness for the gossip
Thank goodness for the gossip
That gets us through the day
Hey!
Have you heard
There’s a rumor in St Petersburg
Have you heard
What they’re saying on the street?
--- Unknown ---
MAN 4
Although the Tsar did not survive
One daughter may be still alive
--- ENSEMBLE ---
The Princess Anastasia
--- Unknown ---
MAN 4
But please do not repeat
--- ENSEMBLE ---
It’s a rumor
A legend
A mystery
Something whispered in an alleyway
Or through a crack
It’s a rumor
That’s part of our history
--- Unknown ---
WOMAN 3
They say her royal grandmamma
Will pay a royal sum
--- ENSEMBLE ---
To someone who can bring the princess back
--- Unknown ---
VLAD (spoken)
Dmitry! They’ve closed another border!
We should have gotten out of Russia while we still could.
St Petersburg was lovely when royalty was in.
I called myself a count as though I’d always been.
I hobnobbed with the royals, but then a change of luck.
The tsar was dead.
The royals fled and comrade now we’re stuck!
--- Unknown ---
DMITRY (spoken)
Vlad! I’ve been thinking about the princess Anastasia.
--- Unknown ---
VLAD (spoken)
Oh not you too, Dmitry!
--- Unknown ---
It’s the rumor
The legend
The mystery
It’s the Princess Anastasia
Who will help us fly
You and I friend
Will go down
In history
We’ll find a girl to play the part
And teach her what to say
Dress her up and take her to Paris
--- VLAD ---
Imagine the reward
Her dear old grandmamma would pay
--- DMITRY & VLAD ---
Who else could pull it off
But you and me
--- Unknown ---
ANYA (spoken)
No!
--- Unknown ---
GLEB (spoken)
It was a truck backfiring comrade, That’s all it was. Those days are over.
Neighbor against neighbor. There’s nothing to be afraid of anymore. You’re shaking.
There’s a tea shop just steps from here, let me…
--- Unknown ---
ANYA (spoken)
Thank you.
--- Unknown ---
GLEB (spoken)
What’s your hurry.
--- Unknown ---
ANYA (spoken)
I can’t lose this job. They’re not easy to come by. But Thank you.

MAN 3
I found this in the palace
Initialed with an “A”

DMITRY (spoken)
We need something of hers to show the old lady.
How much is that music box?
--- Unknown ---

Two cans of beans, comrade?

Do you believe in fairy tales, Vlad?
--- Unknown ---
VLAD (spoken)
Once upon a time I did.

DMITRY (spoken)
We’re going to create a fairy tale the whole world will believe.
Now it’s risky but not more then usual.
We’ll need papers, we’ll need tickets, we’ll need nerves of steel.
--- VLAD ---
Yes it’s risky, a lot more then usual.
--- DMITRY ---
We’ll try to cross the border with our princess and our plot.

Hopefully disaster won’t ensue.

We’ll be rich
--- DMITRY ---
We’ll be out
--- VLAD ---
We’ll be out
--- DMITRY & VLAD ---
And St Petersburg will have some more
To talk about
--- ENSEMBLE ---
I heard it from a person

Who was assured me that it was absolutely true
