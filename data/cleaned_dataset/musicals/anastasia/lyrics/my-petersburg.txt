------ My Petersburg ------
--- DMITRY ---
I grew up
On the sly
In the gutters and the streets
Of Petersburg
Just a kid
On the fly
Getting good at getting by
In Petersburg
I bartered for a blanket
Stolen for my bread
Learned to take my chances
And use my head
A Russian rat is clever
Clever or he ends up dead
Boils down to
There are some
Who survive
Some who don’t
Some give up
Some give in
Me I won’t
Black and blue
Welcome to
My Petersburg
--- Unknown ---
Standing here you can see
From the spires to the piers of Petersburg
I'd be down on that quay
Selling stolen souvenirs of Petersburg
--- Unknown ---
The palaces above and alleyways below
Funny, when a city is all you know,
How even when you hate it
Something in you loves it so
--- Unknown ---
That's where I
Learned my stuff
In some rough
Company
There’s the boy
Growing up
Who was me
All I’ve been
All I’ll be
--- Unknown ---
We can do what we're told
We can go where we're led
But I learned from my father to see what's ahead
--- Unknown ---
Nothing here to hold me
No one that I owe
Funny how a boy can grow
Funny how a city tells you when it's time to go
--- Unknown ---
Boils down to
There are some
Who have walls
Yet to climb
You and I
On the fly
Just in time
But tonight
There’s a sky
And quite a view
--- Unknown ---
Welcome to...
My Petersburg!
