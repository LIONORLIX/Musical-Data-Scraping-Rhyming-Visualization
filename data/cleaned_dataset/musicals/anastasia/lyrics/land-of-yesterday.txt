------ Land of Yesterday ------
--- LILY ---
Once I had a palace.
Here, merely a flat.
I fled with some diamonds
And that was that.
--- ARISTOCRATS ---
It's very tragic.
--- LILY ---
Once, ladies-in-waiting
All bending a knee!
Now, only one lady-in-waiting--Me!
--- MEN ---
No fanfares
--- WOMEN ---
Or sedan chairs
--- MEN ---
And no couches
--- WOMEN ---
And we sold our broaches!
--- LEOPOLD ---
No afternoon card games with the Tsar.
--- LILY ---
No caviar!
But I say we're not dead now!
--- ALL ---
We're not dead now,
We're in France instead, now.
--- LILY ---
Let us not be sad!
The night's youn,
And Russians are mad!
So...
--- Unknown ---
Let's live in the land of yesterday,
Live in the grand Imperial heyday.
Let's live in the land of yesterday Russia!
--- ALL ---
Husha!
--- LILY ---
Let's put on the fancy clothes
And let's while our woes away
--- LILY AND ALL ---
In Russia,
Land of yesterday.
--- LILY ---
In dire circumstances,
Why wallow in regret?
We're out of second chances.
Why are we here, except to forget?
We know the world is fickle.
Life is a leaky sieve!
Pass me a glass
And give me a bow--
And drink to the Countess Nobodynow.
Why should I care
As long as I dare to live...
--- ARISTOCRATS ---
In the land of yesterday...
--- LILY ---
Let's run up the bill
As if we're still
Royalty at play!
--- LILY AND ALL ---
In Russia, Land of yesterday!
--- LILY ---
The night's young
And Russians are mad, so...
--- ALL ---
Let's live in the land of yesterday.
Live in the grand Imperial heyday.
Let's live in the land of yesterday
Russia!
Husha!
--- LILY ---
Let's brush off the days of old
And let's hold the world at bay...
--- ALL ---
Yes, here's to
--- LILY ---
Russia!
--- ALL ---
Here's to
--- LILY AND WOMEN ---
Russia!
--- ALL ---
Here's to Russia!
Land of yesterday.
Land of yesterday.
Hey!
