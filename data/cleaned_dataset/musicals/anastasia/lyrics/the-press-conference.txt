------ The Press Conference ------
--- Male Ensemble ---
Has she been living far or near?
What kind of letter did she send?
--- Lily ---
Excuse me, over here!
--- Male Ensemble ---
The rumors never end!
You've had imposters, is it true?
What sort of proof do you intend?
--- Lily ---
Excuse me, over here!
--- Male Ensemble ---
The rumors never end!
--- Lily (spoken) ---
Good afternoon. I am the Countess Lily Malevsky-Malevich, and this is Count Vladimir Popov.
--- Vlad ---
P-O-P-O-V!
--- Lily ---
The dowager is coming but she's running very late
I'm certain that her majesty will set the record straight
But royalty is royalty, one always has to wait
(spoken) Wait!
I'm really not at liberty to gossip with the press
Her majesty is coming, until then you'll have to guess
--- Vlad ---
Suffice to say
You'll meet today
The little lost princess!
--- Unknown ---
(Much yelling from press)
--- Male ensemble ---
Did she arrive by train?
I heard she may have gone insane!
--- Unknown ---
Lily (spoken): A lie!
--- Male ensemble ---
I'm from the Paris news
We do exclusive interviews!
--- Unknown ---
Vlad (spoken): Oh my!
--- Male ensemble ---
Is she a fake or is she real?
--- Female ensemble ---
How does she look?
How does she feel?
What has she done?
Where has she been?
How did she live?
Who took her in?
--- Lily ---
We're nearly ready to begin!
--- Ensemble ---
Where has she been, what has she done?
Who took her in, is she the one?
We're waiting eagerly to see
Is she the princess Anastasia? (Anastasia!)
--- Lily ---
(spoken) Enough! Now,
Her majesty is elderly and doesn't suffer fools
--- Ensemble ---
She doesn't suffer fools
--- Lily ---
She's ready to receive you but you must obey the rules
--- Ensemble ---
We must obey the rules
--- Lily ---
No smoking and no joking
--- Vlad ---
And no handling the jewels
--- Lily ---
(spoken) Members of the press,
This way!
--- Ensemble ---
Where has she been?
What has she done?
Who took her in?
Is she the one?
We're waiting eagerly to see the princess Anastasia!
