TUNE UP #2
--- MARK ---
Tell the folks at home what you're doing Roger
--- ROGER ---
I'm writing one great song --
--- MARK ---
The phone rings.
--- ROGER ---
Yesss!
--- MARK ---
We screen.
--- Unknown ---
ROGER & MARK'S ANSWERING MACHINE
Speak ... (Beeeep!)
--- Unknown ---
(Lights fade up on the street: the front-door area of MARK and ROGER's building.
Nearby is a battered public pay phone.
TOM COLLINS stands at the phone.)
--- COLLINS ---
Chestnuts roasting ---
--- ROGER & MARK ---
Collins!
--- COLLINS ---
I'm downstairs
--- MARK ---
Hey!
--- COLLINS ---
Roger picked up the phone??
--- MARK ---
No, it's me.
--- COLLINS ---
Throw down the key.
--- Unknown ---
(MARK pulls out a small leather pouch and drops it off the apron downstage center
as if from a window; a weighted leather
pouch plops down from upstairs. COLLINS catches it.)
--- MARK ---
A wild night is now pre-ordained
--- Unknown ---
(Two THUGS appear from above, with clubs.
They are obviously close to attacking COLLINS, who says back into the phone...)
--- COLLINS ---
I may be detained.
--- Unknown ---
(THUGS mime beating and kicking COLLINS,
who falls to the ground as lights on him fade.)
--- MARK ---
What does he mean...?
What do you mean detained?
--- Unknown ---
(Lights come up on BENNY, who's on a cellular phone.)
--- BENNY ---
Ho ho ho.
--- MARK & ROGER ---
Benny! Shit.
--- BENNY ---
Dudes, I'm on my way
--- MARK & ROGER ---
Great! Fuck.
--- BENNY ---
I need the rent
--- MARK ---
What rent?
--- BENNY ---
This past year's rent which I let slide
--- MARK ---
Let slide? You said we were 'golden'
--- ROGER ---
When you bought the building
--- MARK ---
When we were roommates
--- ROGER ---
Remember -- you lived here!?
--- BENNY ---
How could I forget?
You, me, Collins and Maureen
How is the drama queen?
--- MARK ---
She's performing tonight
--- BENNY ---
I know.
Still her production manager?
--- MARK ---
Two days ago I was bumped
--- BENNY ---
You still dating her?
--- MARK ---
Last month I was dumped
--- ROGER ---
She's in love
--- BENNY ---
She's got a new man?
--- MARK ---
Well -- no
--- BENNY ---
What's his name?
--- BOTH ---
Joanne
--- BENNY ---
Rent, my amigos, is due
Or I will have to evict you
Be there in a few
--- Unknown ---
(ROGER defiantly picks out Musetta's theme from Puccini's La Boheme on the electric guitar.
The fuse blows on the amp.)
--- MARK ---
