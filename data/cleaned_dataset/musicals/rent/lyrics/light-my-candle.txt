------ Light My Candle ------
--- ROGER ---
--- Unknown ---
What'd you forget?
--- MIMI enters, holding a candle and looking for a match; ---
[her electricity is down, too.]
--- MIMI ---
--- Unknown ---
Got a light?
--- ROGER ---
--- Unknown ---
I know you? -- You're --
You're shivering
--- MIMI ---
--- Unknown ---
It's nothing
They turned off my heat
And I'm just a little
Weak on my feet
Would you light my candle?
What are you staring at?
--- ROGER ---
--- Unknown ---
Nothing
Your hair in the moonlight
You look familiar
[He lights her candle. MIMI starts to leave, but stumbles.]
Can you make it?
--- MIMI ---
--- Unknown ---
Just haven't eaten much today
At least the room stopped spinning.
Anyway. What?
--- ROGER ---
--- Unknown ---
Nothing
Your smile reminded me of --
--- MIMI ---
--- Unknown ---
I always remind people of -- who is she?
--- ROGER ---
--- Unknown ---
She died. Her name was April
--- MIMI discreetly blows out the candle. ---
--- MIMI ---
--- Unknown ---
It's out again
Sorry about your friend
Would you light my candle?
--- ROGER lights the candle. They linger, awkwardly. ---
--- ROGER ---
--- Unknown ---
Well --
--- MIMI ---
--- Unknown ---
Yeah. Ow!
--- ROGER ---
--- Unknown ---
Oh, the wax -- it's --
--- MIMI ---
--- Unknown ---
Dripping! I like it -- between my --
--- ROGER ---
--- Unknown ---
Fingers. I figured...
Oh, well. Goodnight.
--- MIMI exits. ROGER heads back toward his guitar on the table. ---
[There is another knock, which he answers.]
--- Unknown ---
It blew out again?
--- MIMI ---
--- Unknown ---
No -- I think that I dropped my stash
--- ROGER ---
--- Unknown ---
I know I've seen you out and about
When I used to go out
Your candle's out
--- MIMI ---
--- Unknown ---
I'm illin' --
I had it when I walked in the door
It was pure --
Is it on the floor?
--- ROGER ---
--- Unknown ---
The floor?
--- MIMI gets down on all fours and starts searching ---
[the floor for her stash. She lookss back at ROGER,]
[who is staring at her again.]
--- MIMI ---
--- Unknown ---
They say I have the best ass below 14th street
Is it true?
--- ROGER ---
--- Unknown ---
What?
--- MIMI ---
--- Unknown ---
You're staring again.
--- ROGER ---
--- Unknown ---
Oh no.
I mean you do -- have a nice --
I mean -- You look familiar
--- MIMI ---
--- Unknown ---
Like your dead girlfriend?
--- ROGER ---
--- Unknown ---
Only when you smile.
But I'm sure I've seen you somewhere else --
--- MIMI ---
--- Unknown ---
Do you go to the Cat Scratch Club?
That's where I work - I dance - help me look
--- ROGER ---
--- Unknown ---
Yes!
They used to tie you up --
--- MIMI ---
--- Unknown ---
It's a living
--- MIMI douses the flame again. ---
--- ROGER ---
--- Unknown ---
I didn't recognize you
Without the handcuffs
--- MIMI ---
--- Unknown ---
We could light the candle
Oh won't you light the candle?
--- ROGER lights it again. ---
--- ROGER ---
--- Unknown ---
Why don't you forget that stuff
You look like you're sixteen
--- MIMI ---
--- Unknown ---
I'm nineteen -- but I'm old for my age
I'm just born to be bad
--- ROGER ---
--- Unknown ---
I once was born to be bad
I used to shiver like that
--- MIMI ---
--- Unknown ---
I have no heat -- I told you
--- ROGER ---
--- Unknown ---
I used to sweat
--- MIMI ---
--- Unknown ---
I got a cold
--- ROGER ---
--- Unknown ---
Uh huh
I used to be a junkie
--- MIMI ---
--- Unknown ---
But now and then I like to --
--- ROGER ---
--- Unknown ---
Uh huh
--- MIMI ---
--- Unknown ---
Feel good
--- ROGER ---
--- Unknown ---
Here it -- um --
--- ROGER stoops and picks up a small object: MIMI's stash. ---
--- MIMI ---
--- Unknown ---
What's that?
--- ROGER ---
--- Unknown ---
It's a candy bar wrapper
--- ROGER puts it behind his back and into his pocket. ---
--- MIMI ---
--- Unknown ---
We could light the candle
--- ROGER discreetly blows out the candle. ---
--- MIMI ---
--- Unknown ---
What'd you do with my candle?
--- ROGER ---
--- Unknown ---
That was my last match
--- MIMI ---
--- Unknown ---
Our eyes'll adjust, thank God for the moon
--- ROGER ---
--- Unknown ---
Maybe it's not the moon at all
I hear Spike Lee's shooting down the street
--- MIMI ---
--- Unknown ---
Bah humbug ... Bah humbug
--- MIMI places her hand under his, pretending to do it by accident. ---
--- ROGER ---
--- Unknown ---
Cold hands
--- MIMI ---
--- Unknown ---
Yours too.
Big. Like my father's
You wanna dance?
--- ROGER ---
--- Unknown ---
With you?
--- MIMI ---
--- Unknown ---
No -- with my father
--- ROGER ---
--- Unknown ---
I'm Roger
--- MIMI ---
--- Unknown ---
They call me
They call me Mimi
--- They come extremely close to a kiss. ---
[MIMI reaches into his pocket, nabs the stash,]
