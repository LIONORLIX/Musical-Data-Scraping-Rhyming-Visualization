(The COMPANY forms two main groups. As the music begins,
a group of dancers start a sensual life and death dance, while a
group of actors gather around a table centerstage to speak
words of passion which punctuate the dancing.
Eventually, the actors converge on the table
and cover themselves with a white sheet, while moving to the music.)
