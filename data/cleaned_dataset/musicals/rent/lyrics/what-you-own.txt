------ What You Own ------
--- Unknown ---
Don't breathe too deep
Don't think all day
Dive into work
Drive the other way
That drip of hurt
That pint of shame
Goes away
Just play the game
You're living in America
At the end of the millennium
You're living in America
Leave your conscience at the tone
And when you're living in America
At the end of the millennium
You're what you own
--- Unknown ---
(Lights up on ROGER.)
--- ROGER ---
The filmmaker cannot see
--- MARK ---
And the songwriter cannot hear
--- ROGER ---
Yet I see Mimi everywhere
--- MARK ---
Angel's voice is in my ear
--- ROGER ---
Just tighten those shoulders
--- MARK ---
Just clench your jaw till you frown
--- ROGER ---
Just don't let go
--- BOTH ---
Or you may drown
--- Unknown ---
You're living in America
At the end of the millennium
You're living in America
Where it's like the Twilight Zone
And when you're living in America
At the end of the millennium
You're what you own
So I own not a notion
I escape and ape content
I don't own emotion -- I rent
--- MARK ---
What was it about that night
--- ROGER ---
What was it about that night
--- BOTH ---
Connection -- in an isolating age
--- MARK ---
For once the shadows gave way to light
--- ROGER ---
For once the shadows gave way to light
--- BOTH ---
For once I didn't disengage
--- Unknown ---
(MARK goes to the pay phone and dials.)
--- MARK ---
Angel -- I hear you -- I hear it
I see it -- I see it
My film!
--- ROGER ---
Mimi I see you -- I see it
I hear it -- I hear it
My song!
--- Unknown ---
MARK (on the phone)
Alexi--Mark
Call me a hypocrite
I need to finish my own film
I quit!
--- ROGER ---
One song--glory
Mimi
Your eyes...
--- BOTH ---
Dying in America
At the end of the millennium
We're dying in America
To come into our own
And when you're dying in America
At the end of the millennium
You're not alone
I'm not alone
I'm not alone
