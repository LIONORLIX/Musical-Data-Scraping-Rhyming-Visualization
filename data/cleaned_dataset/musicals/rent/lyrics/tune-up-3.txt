(Lights come up on loft.)
--- ROGER ---
Where are you going?
--- MARK ---
Maureen calls...
--- ROGER ---
You're such a sucker!
--- MARK ---
I don't suppose you'd like to see her show in the lot tonight?
Or come to dinner?
--- ROGER ---
Zoom in on my empty wallet.
--- MARK ---
Touche. Take your AZT.
Close on Roger
His girlfriend April
Left a note saying We've got AIDS
Before slitting her wrists in the bathroom
I'll check up on you later. Change your mind. You have to get out of the house.
