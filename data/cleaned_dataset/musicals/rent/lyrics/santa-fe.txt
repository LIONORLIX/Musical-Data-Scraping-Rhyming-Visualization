New York City --

Uh huh
--- ANGEL ---
Center of the universe
--- COLLINS ---
Sing it girl --
--- ANGEL ---
Times are shitty
But I'm pretty sure they can't get worse
--- MARK ---
I hear you
--- ANGEL ---
It's a comfort to know
When you're singing the hit-the-road blues
That anywhere else you could possibly go
After New York would be a pleasure cruise
--- COLLINS ---
Now you're talking
Well, I'm thwarted by a metaphysic puzzle
And I'm sick of grading papers -- that I know
And I'm shouting in my sleep, I need a muzzle
All this misery pays no salary, so
Let's open up a restaurant in Santa Fe
Oh sunny Santa Fe would be nice
Let's open up a restaurant in Santa Fe
And leave this to the roaches and mice
--- COLLINS ---
Oh--oh
--- ALL ---
Oh--
--- ANGEL ---
You teach?
--- COLLINS ---
-- I teach -- Computer Age Philosophy
But my students would rather watch TV
--- ANGEL ---
America
--- ALL ---
America!
--- COLLINS ---
You're a sensitive aesthete
Brush the sauce onto the meat
You could make the menu sparkle with rhyme
You could drum a gentle drum
I could seat guests as they come
Chatting not about Heidegger, but wine!
Let's open up a restaurant in Santa Fe
Our labors would reap financial gains
--- ALL ---
Gains, gains, gains
--- COLLINS ---
We'll open up a restaurant in Santa Fe
And save from devastation our brains
--- HOMELESS ---
Save our brains
--- ALL ---
We'll pack up all our junk and fly so far away
Devote ourselves to projects that sell
We'll open up a restaurant in Santa Fe
Forget this cold Bohemian hell
Oh--
--- ALL ---
Oh--
--- COLLINS ---
Do you know the way to Santa Fe?
You know, tumbleweeds...prairie dogs...
