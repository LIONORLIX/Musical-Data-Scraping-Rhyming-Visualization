------ Without You ------
--- Unknown ---
Without you, the ground thaws, the rain falls, the grass grows.
Without you, the seeds root, the flowers bloom, the children play.
The stars gleam, the poets dream, the  eagles fly, without you.
The earth turns, the sun burns, but I die, without you.
Without you, the stars roar the breeze warms, the girl smiles, the cloud moves.
Without you, the tides change, the boys run, the oceans crash.
The crowds roar, the  days soar, the babies cry, without you.
The moon glows, the river flows, but I die, without you.
--- MIMI & ROGER ---
The world revives, colors renew, but I know blue, only blue, lonely blue, within
me blue.
--- MIMI ---
Without you. Without you the hand gropes, the ear hears, the pulse beats.
--- ROGER ---
Without you, the eyes gaze, the legs walk, the lungs breathe.
--- ROGER ---
The mind churns!
--- MIMI ---
The mind churns!
--- ROGER ---
The heart yearns!
--- MIMI ---
The heart yearns!
--- BOTH ---
The tears dry, without you. Life goes on, but I?m gone.
--- MIMI ---
Cause I die, without you.
--- ROGER ---
Without you.
--- BOTH ---
