------ You Okay Honey? ------
--- A HOMELESS MAN ---
--- Unknown ---
Christmas bells are ringing
Christmas bells are ringing
Christmas bells are ringing
Somewhere else!
Not here
--- The HOMELESS MAN exits. ANGEL gets a good beat going on the tub, ---
[but is interrupted by a moan. He starts to drum again and sees]
[COLLINS limp to downstage-left proscenium.]
--- ANGEL ---
--- Unknown ---
You okay honey?
--- COLLINS ---
--- Unknown ---
I'm afraid so
--- ANGEL ---
--- Unknown ---
They get any money?
--- COLLINS ---
--- Unknown ---
No
Had none to get --
But they purloined my coat --
Well you missed a sleeve! -- Thanks
--- ANGEL ---
--- Unknown ---
Hell, it's Christmas Eve
I'm Angel
--- COLLINS ---
--- Unknown ---
Angel..? Indeed
An angel of the first degree
Friends call me Collins -- Tom Collins
Nice tree ...
--- ANGEL ---
--- Unknown ---
Let's get a band-aid for your knee
I'll change, there's a Life Support meeting at nine-thirty
Yes -- this body provides a comfortable home
For the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome
--- COLLINS ---
--- Unknown ---
As does mine
--- ANGEL ---
--- Unknown ---
We'll get along fine
Get you a coat, have a bite
Make a night -- I'm flush
--- COLLINS ---
--- Unknown ---
My friends are waiting --
--- ANGEL ---
--- Unknown ---
You're cute when you blush
The more the merri -- ho ho ho
And I do not take no
