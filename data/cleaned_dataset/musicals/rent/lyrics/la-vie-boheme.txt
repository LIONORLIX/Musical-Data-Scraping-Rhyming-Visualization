(Downstage right, the PRINCIPALS have lined up and are waiting to be seated.
A large table is situated down center.
Down and to the right, BENNY and MR. GREY are seated at a smaller table.
The RESTAURANT MAN tries to shoo our friends out.)
--- RESTAURANT MAN ---
No please no
Not tonight please no
Mister -- can't you go --
Not tonight -- can't have a scene
--- ROGER ---
What?
--- RESTAURANT MAN ---
Go, please go;
You -- Hello, sir --
I said, No
Important customer
--- MARK ---
What am I -- just a blur?
--- RESTAURANT MAN ---
You sit all night -- you never buy!
--- MARK ---
That's a lie -- that's a lie
I had a tea the other day
--- RESTAURANT MAN ---
You couldn't pay
--- MARK ---
Oh yeah
--- COLLINS ---
Benjamin Coffin III -- here?
--- RESTAURANT MAN ---
Oh no!
--- ALL ---
Wine and beer!
--- MAUREEN ---
The enemy of Avenue A
We'll stay
--- Unknown ---
(They sit.)
--- RESTAURANT MAN ---
Oy vey!
--- COLLINS ---
What brings the mogul in his own mind to the Life Cafe?
--- BENNY ---
I would like to propose a toast
To Maureen's noble try
It went well
--- MAUREEN ---
Go to hell
--- BENNY ---
Was the yuppie scum stomped
Not counting the homeless
How many tickets weren't comped

There was a death in the family
If you must know
--- ANGEL ---
Who died?
--- BENNY ---
Our Akita
--- BENNY, MARK, ANGEL, COLLINS ---
Evita
--- BENNY ---
Mimi -- I'm surprised
A bright and charming girl like you
Hangs out with these slackers
They make fun -- yet I'm the one
Attempting to do some good
Or do you really want a neighborhood
Where people piss on your stoop every night?
Bohemia, Bohemia's
A fallacy in your head
This is Calcutta
Bohemia is dead
--- Unknown ---
(The BOHEMIANS immediately begin to enact a mock funeral,
with MARK delivering the eulogy.)
--- MARK ---
Dearly beloved we gather here to say our goodbyes
--- COLLINS & ROGER ---
Dies irae -- dies illa
Kyrie eleison
Yitgadal v' yitkadash, etc.
--- MARK ---
Here she lies
No one knew her worth
The late great daughter of mother earth
On this night when we celebrate the birth
In that little town of Bethlehem
We raise our glass -- you bet your ass to --
La vie Boheme
--- ALL ---
La vie Boheme
La vie Boheme
La vie Boheme
La vie Boheme
--- MARK ---
To days of inspiration
Playing hookie, making something out of nothing
The need to express --
To communicate,
To going against the grain,
Going insane
Going mad
--- Unknown ---
To loving tension, no pension
To more than one dimension,
To starving for attention,
Hating convention, hating pretension
Not to mention of course,
Hating dear old mom and dad
--- Unknown ---
To riding your bike,
Midday past the three piece suits
To fruits -- to no absolutes --
To Absolut -- to choice --
To the Village Voice --
To any passing fad
To being an us for once
Instead of a them
--- ALL ---

Is the equipment in a pyramid?
--- JOANNE ---
It is, Maureen

The mixer doesn't have a case
Don't give me that face
--- Unknown ---
(MAUREEN smacks JOANNE's ass as she exits. MR. GREY reacts.)
--- MR. GREY ---
Ahhemm
--- MAUREEN ---
Hey Mister -- she's my sister
--- RESTAURANT MAN ---
So that's five miso soup, four seaweed salad
Three soy burger dinner, two tofu dog platter
And one pasta with meatless balls
--- A BOY ---
Ugh
--- COLLINS ---
It tastes the same
--- MIMI ---
If you close your eyes
--- RESTAURANT MAN ---
And thirteen orders of fries
Is that it here?
--- ALL ---
Wine and beer!
--- MIMI & ANGEL ---
To hand-crafted beers made in local breweries
To yoga, to yogurt, to rice and beans and cheese
To leather, to dildos, to curry vindaloo
To huevos rancheros and Maya Angelou
--- MAUREEN & COLLINS ---
Emotion, devotion, to causing a commotion
Creation, vacation

In honor of the death of Bohemia an impromptu salon will commence immediately following dinner...
Mimi Marquez, clad only in bubble wrap,
will perform her famous lawn chair-handcuff dance to the sounds of iced tea being stirred.
--- ROGER ---
Mark Cohen will preview his new documentary
about his inability to hold an erection on high holy days.

(ROGER picks up an electric guitar and starts to tune it.)
--- MARK ---
Maureen Johnson, back from her spectacular one-night engagement at the eleventh street lot,
Will sing native american tribal chants backwards through her vocoder,
While accompanying herself on the electric cello --
Which she has never studied.
--- Unknown ---
(At this point, JOANNE has entered and seen MAUREEN playfully kiss MARK.
JOANNE exits. BENNY pulls MIMI aside.)
--- BENNY ---
Your new boyfriend doesn't know about us?
--- MIMI ---
There's nothing to know
--- BENNY ---
Don't you think that we should discuss --
--- MIMI ---
It was three months ago
--- BENNY ---
He doesn't act like he's with you
--- MIMI ---
We're taking it slow
--- BENNY ---
Where is he now?
--- MIMI ---
He's right -- hmm
--- BENNY ---
Uh huh
--- MIMI ---
Where'd he go?
--- MARK ---
Roger will attempt to write a bittersweet, evocative song.
That doesn't remind us of Musetta's Waltz
--- COLLINS ---
Angel Dumott Schunard will now model the latest fall fashions from Paris
While accompanying herself on the 10 gallon plastic pickle tub.
--- ANGEL ---
And Collins will recount his exploits as an anarchist --
Including the successful reprogramming of the M.I.T. virtual reality equipment
To self-destruct, as it broadcast the words:
--- ALL ---
Actual reality -- Act Up -- Fight AIDS
--- BENNY ---
Check!!
--- Unknown ---
(BENNY exits. Lights on MIMI and ROGER.)
--- MIMI ---
Excuse me -- did I do something wrong?
I get invited -- then ignored -- all night long
--- ROGER ---
I've been trying -- I'm not lying
No one's perfect. I've got baggage

Life's too short, babe, time is flying
I'm looking for baggage that goes with mine
--- ROGER ---
I should tell, you --
--- MIMI ---
I've got baggage too
