------ Take Me Or Leave Me ------
--- MAUREEN ---
Every single day,
I walk down the street
I hear people say 'baby so sweet'
Ever since puberty,
Everybody stares at me
Boys, girls, I can't help it baby
so be kind, and don't lose your mind
just remember that I'm your baby
--- Unknown ---
take me for what I am
who I was meant to be
and if you give a damn
take me baby,
or leave me
--- Unknown ---
take me or leave me
--- MAUREEN ---
a tiger in a cage
can never see the sun
this diva needs her stage
baby,lets have fun.
you are the one I choose
folks would kill to fill your shoes
you love the lime light too, now baby,
so be mine and don't waste my time cryin'
'honey bear are you still my, my, my baby?'
--- Unknown ---
take me for what I am
who I was meant to be
and if you give a damn
take me baby or leave me
--- Unknown ---
no way, can I be what I'm not
but hey, don't you want your girl hot?
--- Unknown ---
oh, don't fight, don't lose your head
'cause every night who's in your bed?
who?
who's in your bed?
spoken: kiss pookie
--- JOANNE ---
it won't work
I look before I leap
I love margins and discipline
I make list in my sleep baby
whats my sin?
never quit
I follow through
I hate mess but I love you
what do with my improptu baby?
so be wise 'cause this girl satisfies
you got a prize but don't compomise
your one lucky baby
