------ Goodbye Love ------
--- Unknown ---
(The PRINCIPALS emerge from the church.)
--- Unknown ---
MIMI (to ROGER)
It's true you sold your guitar and bought a car?
--- ROGER ---
It's true -- I'm leaving now for Santa Fe
It's true you're with this yuppie scum?
--- BENNY ---
You said you'd never speak to him again
--- MIMI ---
Not now
--- MAUREEN ---
Who said that you have any say
In who she says things to at all?
--- ROGER ---
Yeah!
--- JOANNE ---
Who said that you should
Stick your nose in other people's ...
--- MAUREEN ---
Who said I was talking to you?
--- JOANNE ---
We used to have this fight each night
--- MARK ---
Calm down
--- JOANNE ---
She'd never admit I existed
--- MARK ---
Everyone please!
--- MIMI ---
He was the same way -- he was always
Run away -- hit the road
Don't commit -- you're full of shit
--- JOANNE ---
She's in denial
--- MIMI ---
He's in denial
--- JOANNE ---
Didn't give an inch
When I gave a mile
--- MARK ---
Come on
--- MIMI ---
I gave a mile
--- ROGER ---
Gave a mile to who?
--- MARK & BENNY ---
Come on guys chill!
--- MIMI & JOANNE ---
I'd be happy to die for a taste of what Angel had
Someone to live for -- unafraid to say I love you
--- ROGER ---
All your words are nice Mimi
But love's not a three way street
You'll never share real love
Until you love yourself -- I should know
--- COLLINS ---
You all said you'd be cool today
So please -- for my sake...
I can't believe he's gone
(to ROGER) I can't believe you're going
I can't believe this family must die
Angel helped us believe in love
I can't believe you disagree
--- ALL ---
I can't believe this is goodbye
--- Unknown ---
(MAUREEN and JOANNE look at each other.)
--- MAUREEN ---
Pookie...
--- JOANNE ---
Honeybear...
--- Unknown ---
(They embrace.)
--- JOANNE ---
I missed you...
MAUREEN
I missed your smell...
--- JOANNE ---
I missed your mouth...Your...
--- Unknown ---
(They kiss, but MAUREEN pulls away.)
--- MAUREEN ---
Ow!
--- JOANNE ---
What?
--- MAUREEN ---
Nothing, Pookie.
--- JOANNE ---
No, baby, you said ow...What?
--- MAUREEN ---
Well, you bit my tongue...
--- JOANNE ---
No, I didn't.
--- MAUREEN ---
You did -- I'm bleeding.
--- JOANNE ---
No, it isn't...
--- MAUREEN ---
I think I should know
--- JOANNE ---
Let me see--
--- MAUREEN ---
She doesn't believe me!
--- JOANNE ---
I was only trying to...
--- Unknown ---
(They laugh, hug, and wave goodbye, exiting stage right.
The PASTOR from the church emerges on the above.)
--- PASTOR ---
Thomas B. Collins...
--- COLLINS ---
Coming.
--- Unknown ---
(The PASTOR exits above and COLLINS exits into the church.
BENNY stands off to the side as MIMI approaches ROGER,
who turns
away. She hesitates before leaving with BENNY. ROGER and MARK are left alone.)
--- MARK ---
I hear there are great restaurants out west
--- ROGER ---
Some of the best. How could she?
--- MARK ---
How could you let her go?
--- ROGER ---
You just don't know ... How could we lose Angel?
--- MARK ---
Maybe you'll see why when you stop escaping your pain
At least now if you try -- Angel's death won't be in vain
--- ROGER ---
His death is in vain
--- Unknown ---
(MIMI reappears up left, in the shadows.
She overhears ROGER and MARK's conversation.)
--- MARK ---
Are you insane?
There so much to care about
There's me -- there's Mimi
--- ROGER ---
Mimi's got her baggage, too
--- MARK ---
So do you
--- ROGER ---
Who are you to tell me what I know, what to do
--- MARK ---
A friend
--- ROGER ---
But who, Mark, are you?
Mark has got his work
They say Mark lives for his work
And Mark's in love with his work
Mark hides in his work
--- MARK ---
But from what?
--- ROGER ---
From facing your failure, facing your loneliness
Facing the fact you live a lie
Yes, you live a lie -- tell you why
You're always preaching not to be numb
When that's how you thrive
You pretend to create and observe
When you really detach from feeling alive
--- MARK ---
Perhaps it's because I'm the one of us to survive
--- ROGER ---
Poor baby
--- MARK ---
Mimi still loves Roger
Is Roger really jealous
Or afraid that Mimi's weak
--- ROGER ---
Mimi did look pale
--- MARK ---
Mimi's gotten thin
Mimi's running out of time
Roger's running out the door
--- ROGER ---
No more! Oh no!
I've gotta go
--- MARK ---
Hey, for somebody who's always been let down
Who's heading out of town?
--- ROGER ---
For someone who longs for a community of his own,
Who's with his camera, alone?
I'll call
I hate the fall
You heard?
--- MIMI ---
Every word
You don't want baggage without lifetime guarantees
You don't want to watch me die
I just came to say
Goodbye, love
Goodbye, love
Came to say goodbye, love, goodbye
--- MIMI ---
Just came to say
Goodbye love
Goodbye love
Goodbye love
Goodbye!
--- ROGER ---
Glory
One blaze of
Glory
Have to find...
--- Unknown ---
(ROGER exits. BENNY returns. MIMI steps away.)
--- MIMI ---
Please don't touch me
Understand
I'm scared
I need to go away
--- MARK ---
I know a place -- a clinic
--- BENNY ---
A rehab?
--- MIMI ---
Maybe -- could you?
--- BENNY ---
I'll pay
--- MIMI ---
Goodbye love
Goodbye love
Came to say goodbye, love, goodbye
Just came to say
Goodbye love
Goodbye love
Goodbye love
Hello disease
--- Unknown ---
(MIMI runs away. After a moment,
COLLINS quicjkly enters, with the PASTOR trailing behind him.)
--- PASTOR ---
Off the premises now, we give no handouts here!
--- MARK ---
What happened to Rest In Peace?!
--- PASTOR ---
Off the premises, queer!
--- COLLINS ---
That's no way to send a boy to meet his maker!
They had to know we couldn't pay the undertaker.
--- Unknown ---
BENNY (To COLLINS)
Don't you worry 'bout him.
(To PASTOR) Hey, I'll take care of it!
--- Unknown ---
(The PASTOR acknowledges BENNY and exits.)
--- MARK ---
Must be nice to have money.
--- ALL THREE ---
No shit!
--- COLLINS ---
I think it's only fair to tell you, you just paid for the funeral of the person who killed your dog.
--- BENNY ---
I know... I always hated that dog...
Let's pay him off, and then get drunk.
--- MARK ---
I can't... I have a meeting.
--- BENNY & COLLINS ---
Punk! Let's go.
--- Unknown ---
(COLLINS and BENNY exit.)
--- Unknown ---
MARK (imagining)
Hi. Mark Cohen here, reporting for Buzzline.
Back to you, Alexi! Coming up next,
vampire welfare queens who are compulsive bowlers...
