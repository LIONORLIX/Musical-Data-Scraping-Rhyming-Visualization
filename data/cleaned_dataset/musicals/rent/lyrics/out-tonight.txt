------ Out Tonight ------

OUT TONIGHT (Mimi's apartment)
--- MIMI ---
What's the time?
Well it's gotta be close to midnight
My body's talking to me
It says, Time for danger
It says I wanna commit a crime
Wanna be the cause of a fight
Wanna put on a tight skirt and flirt
With a stranger
I've had a knack from way back
At breaking the rules once I learn the games
Get up - life's too quick
I know someplace sick
Where this chick'll dance in the flames
We don't need any money
I always get in for free
You can get in too
If you get in with me
--- Unknown ---
Let's go out tonight
I have to go out tonight
You wanna play?
Let's run away
We won't be back before it's Christmas day
Take me out tonight (meow)
--- Unknown ---
When I get a wink from the doorman
Do you know how lucky you'll be?
That you're on line with the feline of Avenue B
--- Unknown ---
Let's go out tonight
I have to go out tonight
You wanna prowl
Be my night owl?
Well take my hand we're gonna howl
Out tonight
--- Unknown ---
In the evening I've got to roam
Can't sleep in the city of neon and chrome
Feels too damn much like home
When the Spanish babies cry
So let's find a bar
So dark we forget who we are
And all the scars from the
Nevers and maybes die
--- Unknown ---
Let's go out tonight
Have to go out tonight
You're sweet
Wanna hit the street?
Wanna wail at the moon like a cat in heat?
Just take me out tonight
--- Unknown ---
(MIMI makes her way to ROGER's door and ends the song in front of him.)
--- Unknown ---
Please take me out tonight
Don't forsake me -- out tonight
I'll let you make me -- out tonight
