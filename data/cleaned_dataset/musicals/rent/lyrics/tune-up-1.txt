------ Tune Up 1 ------
--- MARK ---
December 24th, Nine PM
Eastern Standard Time
From here on in
I shoot without a script
See if anything comes of it
Instead of my old shit
First shot -- Roger
Tuning the Fender guitar
He hasn't played in a year
--- ROGER ---
This won't tune
--- MARK ---
So we hear
He's just coming back
From half a year of withdrawal
--- ROGER ---
Are you talking to me?
--- MARK ---
Not at all
Are you ready? Hold that focus -- steady
Tell the folks at home what you're doing Roger ...
--- ROGER ---
I'm writing one great song --
--- MARK ---
The phone rings.
--- ROGER ---
Saved!
--- MARK ---
We screen
