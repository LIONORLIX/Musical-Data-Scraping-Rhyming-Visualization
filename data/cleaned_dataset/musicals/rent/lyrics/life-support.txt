(ANGEL and COLLINS attend an AIDS Life Support group.
PAUL, the support leader, sits on the downstage railing above. GORDON,
one of the members of the group, is standing downstage left, facing the audience.
As the members enter, they introduce themselves and form a semicircle.
Note: The names of the support group members should change every night and should honor
actual friends of the company who have died of AIDS.)

Then why choose fear?

Look - I find some of what you teach suspect
Because I'm used to relying on intellect
But I try to open up to what I don't know
