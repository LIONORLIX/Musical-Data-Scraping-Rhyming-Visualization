(ROGER and MIMI exit. JOANNE reenters, obviously steamed.)
--- MAUREEN ---
Are we packed?
--- JOANNE ---
Yes and by next week
I want you to be
--- MAUREEN ---
Pookie?
--- JOANNE ---
And you should see
They've padlocked your building
And they're rioting on Avenue B
Benny called the cops
--- MAUREEN ---
That fuck!
--- JOANNE ---
They don't know what they're doing
The cops are sweeping the lot
But no one's leaving
They're just sitting there, mooing!
--- ALL ---
Yeah!!!
To dance!
--- A GIRL ---
No way to make a living, masochism, pain, perfection
Muscle spasms, chiropractors, short careers, eating disorders!
--- ALL ---
Film!
--- MARK ---
Adventure, tedium, no family, boring locations,
Dark rooms, perfect faces, egos, money, Hollywood and sleaze!
--- ALL ---
Music!
--- ANGEL ---
Food of love, emotion, mathematics, isolation,
Rhythm, feeling, power, harmony, and heavy competition!
--- ALL ---
Anarchy!
--- COLLINS & MAUREEN ---
Revolution, justice, screaming for solutions,
Forcing changes, risk, and danger
Making noise and making pleas!
--- ALL ---
To faggots, lezzies, dykes, cross dressers too
--- MAUREEN ---
To me
--- MARK ---
To me
--- COLLINS & ANGEL ---
To me
--- ALL ---
To you, and you and you, you and you
To people living with, living with, living with
Not dying from disease
Let he among us without sin
Be the first to condemn
La vie Boheme
La vie Boheme
La vie Boheme
--- MARK ---
Anyone out of the mainstream
Is anyone in the mainstream?
Anyone alive--with a sex drive
--- OTHERS ---
La vie boheme
La vie boheme
La vie boheme
--- MARK ---
Tear down the wall
Aren't we all?
The opposite of war isn't peace...
It's creation!
--- ALL ---
La vie Boheme
--- MARK ---
The riot continues. The Christmas tree goes up in flames. The snow dances.
Oblivious, Mimi and Roger share a small, lovely kiss
