--- Unknown ---
All: in diapers, report cards,
In spoke wheels
In speeding tickets
In contracts
Dollars in funerals and births.
Five hundred twenty five thousand six hundred minutes.
How do you figure our last year on earth.
Figure in love
Figure in love
Figure in love
Measure in love
Seasons of love
Seasons of love
