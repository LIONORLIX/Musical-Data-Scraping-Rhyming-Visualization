------ Every Rose Has Its Thorn ------
--- Unknown ---
We both lie silently still
In the dead of the night
Although we both lie close together
We feel miles apart inside
--- Unknown ---
Was it something I said or something I did
Did my words not come out right
Though I tried not to hurt you
Though I tried
But I guess thats why they say
--- Chorus ---
Every rose has its thorn
Just like every night has its dawn
Just like every cowboy sings his sad, sad song
Every rose has its thorn
--- Unknown ---
Yeah it does
--- Unknown ---
I listen to our favorite song
Playing on the radio
Hear the dj say loves a game of easy come and
Easy go
But I wonder does he know
Has he ever felt like this
And I know that youd be here right now
If I could have let you know somehow
I guess
--- Unknown ---
Chorus
--- Unknown ---
Though its been a while now
I can still feel so much pain
Like a knife that cuts you the wound heals
But the scar, that scar remains
--- Unknown ---
Solo
--- Unknown ---
I know I could have saved a love that night
If Id known what to say
Instead of makin love
We both made our separate ways
--- Unknown ---
But now I hear you found somebody new
And that I never meant that much to you
To hear that tears me up inside
And to see you cuts me like a knife
I guess
