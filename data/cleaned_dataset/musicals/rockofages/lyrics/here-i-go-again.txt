------ Here I Go Again ------
--- Sherrie ---
I don’t know where i’m going
But i sure know where i’ve been
Hanging on the promises
And the songs of yesterday
And i’ve made up my mind
I ain’t wasting no more time
And here i go again
Here i go again
--- Drew ---
Though i keep searching for an answer
I never seem to find what i’m looking for
Oh lord, i pray you give me strength to carry on
‘cause i know what it means
To walk along the lonely street of dreams
--- Drew/ sherrie ---
Here i go again on my own
Goin’ down the only road i’ve ever known
Like a drifter i was born to walk alone
--- Sherrie ---
And i’ve made up my mind
--- Drew ---
I ain’t wasting no more time
--- Stacee jaxx ---
Just another heart in need of rescue
Waiting on love’s sweet charity
It’s just so confusing!
--- Dennis ---
And i’m gonna hold on
For the rest of my days
--- Lonny ---
‘cause i know what it means
To walk along the lonely street of dreams

And i’ve made up my mind

But here i go again!

Oh, whoa, oh
Here i go again

Here i go, here i go
Here i go again

Here i go!!
--- Company ---
And here i go again on my own
Goin’ down the only road i’ve ever known
Like a drifter i was born to walk alone
--- Sherrie ---
And i’ve made up my mind

I ain’t wasting no more time
--- Company ---
Here i go again on my own
Goin’ down the only road i’ve ever known
Like a drifter i was born to walk alone
‘cause i know what it means
To walk along the lonely street of dreams
Here i go again!
