------ I Hate Myself For Loving You / Heat Of The Moment ------
--- Sherrie ---
Hey, Jack- it's a fact they're talkin in town
I turn my back and you're messin around.
I'm not really jealous- dont like lookin like a clown.
--- Unknown ---
I think of you every night and day
You took my heart and you took my pride away...
--- Stacee ---
I never meant to be so bad to you
One thing I said that I would never do
A look from you and I would fall from grace
And that would wipe the smile right from my face
--- Sherrie(Chorus) ---
I hate myself for loving you,
Can't break free from the things that you do.
I wanna walk but I run back to you
Thats why I hate myself for lovin you
--- Stacee ---
It was the heat of the moment
Telling me what my heart meant
The heat of the moment showed in your eyes
--- Sherrie ---
I think of you every night and day
You took my heart and you took my pride away...
--- Stacee ---
It was the heat of the moment
Telling me what my heart meant
The heat of the moment showed in your eyes, eyes....
--- Drew ---
That's why I hate myself for loving you
