What? You want to... Hit me?
Well you're the real tough cookie
With a long history of breaking little hearts, like the one in me.
Ah!
That's okay.
Let's see how you do it
Put up your dukes,
And let's get down to it! Ah...
Hit me with your best shot!
Why don't you hit me with your best shot?
Hit me with your best shot!
Fire away!
All i've ever done is try to please you!
But you know what? No more!
