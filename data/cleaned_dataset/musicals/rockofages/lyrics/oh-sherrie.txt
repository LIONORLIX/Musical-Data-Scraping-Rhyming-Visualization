------ Oh Sherrie ------
--- Unknown ---
You should've been gone
Knowing how I made you feel
And I should've been gone
After all your words of steel
Oh, I must've been a dreamer
And I must've been someone else
And we should've been over
--- Unknown ---
Oh, Sherrie, our love
Holds on, holds on
Oh, Sherrie, our love
Holds on, holds on
--- Unknown ---
Oh, I want to let go
You'll go on hurtin' me
You'd be better off alone
If I'm not who you thought I'd be
--- Unknown ---
But you know that there's a fever
Oh, that you'll never find nowhere else
Can't you feel it burnin'
On-and-on
--- Unknown ---
Oh, Sherrie, our love
Holds on, holds on
Oh, Sherrie, our love
Holds on, holds on
Oh, Sherrie
--- Unknown ---
Oh, Sherrie
--- Unknown ---
But I should've been gone
Long ago, far away
And you should've been gone
Now I know you'd lie
You'll stay
--- Unknown ---
Oh, Sherrie, our love
Holds on, holds on
Oh, Sherrie, our love
Holds on, holds on
--- Unknown ---
Oh, Sherrie, our love
Holds on, holds on
--- Unknown ---
Hold on
