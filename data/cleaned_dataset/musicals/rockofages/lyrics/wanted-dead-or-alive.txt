Lead singer of the band arsenal. Yes, ladies love him. Guys want to be him…and his band? Well, they hate his guts. But he’s a

It’s all the same
Only the names have changed
Everyday, it seems were wastin’ away
Another place where the faces are so cold
I’d drive all night
Just to get back home
I’m a cowboy
On a steel horse i ride
I’m wanted
Dead or alive
Wanted
Dead or alive
Sometimes i sleep
Sometimes it’s not for days
The people i meet
Always go their separate ways
Sometimes you tell the day
By the bottle that you drink

And i’m standing tall
