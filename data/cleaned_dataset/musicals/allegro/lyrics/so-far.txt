------ So Far ------
--- Unknown ---
We have nothing to remember, so far, so far.
So far we haven't walked by night and shared the light of a star.
So far,your heart has never fluttered so near,
So near that my own heart alone could hear it.
We haven't gone beyond the very beginning.
We've just begun to know how lucky we are
So we have nothing to remember so far, so far.
But now I'm face to face with you
And now at last we've met.
