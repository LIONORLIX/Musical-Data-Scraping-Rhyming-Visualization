------ Winters Go By ------
--- Unknown ---
The winters go by,
The summers fly,
And soon you're a student in High!
And now your clothes are spotlessly clean,
Your head is anointed with brilliantine. . .
You're brimming with hope
But can't quite cope
With problems that vex and perplex,
For you don't quite know how to treat
The bewild'ringly opposite sex.
--- Unknown ---
What do you suppose Jenny would do if you kissed her?
Jenny is so innocent, so frail!
You could crush her in your strong, manly arms. . .
But that wouldn't be right.
Besides she might get sore~
Might yell, and wake up her old man!
--- Unknown ---
(Poor Joe!
The older you grow,
The harder it is to know
What to think,
What to do,
Where to go!)
--- Unknown ---
Heigh-ho!  It would be nice. . .
Think about it as you walk home.
Make believe you did it,
And make out she wasn't mad
When you kissed her.
Gee, wouldn't it be wonderful
