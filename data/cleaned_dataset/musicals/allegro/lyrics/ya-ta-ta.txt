Busy!
Busy!
I'm busy as a bee!
I start the day at half-past one.
When I am finished phoning
It's time to dress for tea.
Nothing I have to do gets done!

Who keep a metropolis alive
Drink cocktails
And knock tails
Ev'ry afternoon at five.)

Doctor,
Doctor,
I need another shot!
(The shots he gives are too divine!
He fills a little needle and he gives you all it's got.
Your fanny hurts, but you feel fine.)

Broccoli, Hogwah, Balderdash,
Phoney, Baloney, Tripe, and Trash!
Goodness knows where the day has gone!
The years of a life are quickly gone,
But the talk, talk, talk goes on and on
And on and on and on~
The prattle and the tattle,
The gab and the gush,
The chatter and the patter,
And the twaddle and the tush
