------ You Are Never Away ------
--- Unknown ---
You are never away from your home in my heart;
There is never a day when you don't play a part
In a word that I say, or a sight that I see.
--- Unknown ---
You are never away and I'll never be free.
You're the smile on my face, or a song that I sing;
You're a rainbow I chase on a morning in Spring;
You're a star in the lace of a wild willow tree,
In the green leafy lace of a wild willow tree.
--- Unknown ---
But tonight you're no star, nor a song that I sing.
In my arms where you are, you are sweeter than Spring;
In my arms where you are clinging closely to me,
You are lovelier by far, than I dreamed you could be.
