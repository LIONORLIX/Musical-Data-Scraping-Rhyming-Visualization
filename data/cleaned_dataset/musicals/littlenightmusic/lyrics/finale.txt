--- DESIREE ---
What a surprise.
Who could foresee?
I'd come to feel about you
What you felt about me?
Why only now when I see that you've drifted away?
What a surprise.
What a cliché.
--- Unknown ---
Isn't it rich?
--- FREDRIK ---
Are we a pair?
You here at last on the ground.
--- DESIREE ---
You in mid-air.
Was that a farce?
--- FREDRIK ---
My fault, I fear.
--- DESIREE ---
Me as a merry-go-round.
--- FREDRIK ---
Me as King Lear.
Make way for the clowns.
--- DESIREE ---
Applause for the clowns.
--- FREDRIK & DESIREE ---
