------ The Glamorous Life ------
--- FREDRIKA ---
Ordinary mothers lead ordinary lives,
Keep the house and sweep the parlor,
Cook the meals and look exhausted.
Ordinary mothers, like ordinary wives,
Fry the eggs and dry the sheets
And try to deal with facts--
Mine acts!
--- DESIREE ---
Darling, I miss you a lot,
But, darling, this has to be short,
As mother is getting a plaque
From the Halsingborg Arts Council Amateur Theatre Group.
Whether it's funny or not,
I'll give you a fuller report
The minute they carry me back
From the Halsingborg Arts Council Amateur Theatre Group.
Love you.

Unpack the luggage, la la la,
Pack up the luggage, la la la,
Unpack the luggage, la la la,
Hi-ho, the glamorous life!
--- MR. SEGSTROM ---
Ice in the basin, la la la,
--- MR. ERLANSEN ---
Cracks in the plaster, la la la,
--- MRS. ANDERSSEN ---
Mice in the hallway, la la la,
--- QUINTET ---
Hi-ho, the glamorous life!
Run for the carriage, la la la,
Wolf down the sandwich, la la la,
Which town is this one, la la la,
Hi-ho, the glamorous life!
--- MADAME ARMFELDT ---
Ordinary daughters ameliorate their lot,
Use their charms and choose their futures,
Breed their children, heed their mothers.
Ordinary daughters, which mine, I fear, is not,
Tend each asset, spend it wisely
While it still endures--
Mine tours!
--- DESIREE ---
Mother, forgive the delay.
My schedule is driving me wild.
But, mother, I really must run--
I'm performing in Rottwig, and don't ask where is it,
Please...
How are you feeling today?
And are you corrupting the child?
Don't.
Mother, the minute I'm done
With performing in Rottwig, I'll come for a visit
And argue.
--- QUINTET ---
Mayors with speeches, la la la,
Children with posies, la la la,
Half-empty houses, la la la,
Hi-ho, the glamorous life!
--- MRS. NORDSTROM ---
Cultural lunches,
--- QUINTET ---
La la la,
--- MRS. ANDERSSEN ---
Dead floral tributes,
--- QUINTET ---
La la la,
--- MR. LINDQUIST ---
Ancient admirers,
--- QUINTET ---
La la la,
Hi-ho, the glamorous life.
--- DESIREE ---
Pack up the luggage, la la la,
Unpack the luggage, la la la,
Mother's surviving, la la la,
Leading the glamorous life.
Cracks in the plaster, la la la,
Youngish admirers, la la la,
Which one was that one, la la la,
Hi-ho, the glamorous life.
--- DESIREE & QUINTET ---
Bring up the curtain, la la la,
Bring down the curtain, la la la,
Bring up the curtain, la la la,
Hi-ho, the glamorous...
--- DESIREE ---
