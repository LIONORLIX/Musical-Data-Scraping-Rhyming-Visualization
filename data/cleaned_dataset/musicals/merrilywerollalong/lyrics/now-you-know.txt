Now You Know
JOE
So we'll do a new show,
So you'll meet a new dame,
So you'll take some time for personal pleasure.
--- CHARLEY ---
There gotta be endings
Or there wouldn't be beginnings ?
Right?
--- LES ---
You got talent to blow
And you're making a name
And that song you wrote's a national treasure.
--- TED, JEROME ---
You're looking at losses
When you should be counting winnings ?
--- JOE, LES, CHARLEY, TED ---
Right!
--- CHARLEY ---
Best thing that ever could have happened ?
--- FRANK ---
Right.
--- ALEX ---
So you'll get a new flat
And you'll have a few things,
Start a whole new life and learn to adore it ?
--- KATE ---
If you want to have weddings,
Then you gotta have divorces ?
No?
--- TERRY ---
Though it's sad and all that,
You get over these things,
And you come out somehow better for it ?
--- JEROME ---
Just because you change horses
Doesn't mean you're changing courses ?
--- ALL ---
Right!!
--- JEROME ---
Best thing that ever could have happened,
I say best thing that ever could have happened ? !
--- TERRY ---
Best thing that ever could have happened ? !
--- ALEX ---
One more thing not to think about ?
--- TED ---
It was all getting much to complicated ?
--- FRANK ---
Right!
--- MARY ---
All right, now you know:
Life is crummy.
Well, now you know.
--- I mean, big surprise ---
People love you and tell you lies.
Bricks can fall out of clear blue skies.
Put your dimple down,
Now you know.
--- Unknown ---
Okay, there you go ?
Learn to live with it,
Now you know.
--- Unknown ---
It's called flowers wilt,
It's called apples rot,
It's called theives get rich and saints get shot,
It's called God don't answer prayers a lot,
Okay, now you know.
--- Unknown ---
Okay, now you know,
Now forget it.
Don't fall apart at the seams.
It's called letting go your illusions,
And don't confuse them with dreams.
--- Unknown ---
Yes sir, quite a blow ?
Don't regret it,
And don't let's go to extremes.
It's called what's your choice?
It's called count to ten.
It's called burn your bridges, start again.
You should burn them every now and then
Or you'll never grow!
--- Unknown ---
Because now you grow.
That's the killer, is
Now you grow.
--- Unknown ---
You're right, nothing's fair,
And it's all a plot,
And tomorrow doesn't look so hot ?
Right, you better look at what you've got:
Over here, hello?
Okay, now you know,
Right?
--- TERRY ---
It's a month at most ?
--- LES ---
Sure, you'll spin a few wheels ?
--- ALEX ---
But you don't look back ?
--- KATE ---
Just leave all the pieces.
--- GROUP I ---
When you haven't got one choice,
Might as well enjoy the other.
--- GROUP II ---
Right!
--- TERRY ---
You'll come out to the coast ?
--- JEROME ---
We can set a few deals,
And I'm talking strictly major releases.
--- GROUP II ---
An exit from one place
Is an entrance to another.
--- GROUP I ---
Right!
--- CHARLEY ---
Best thing that ever could have ?
--- MARY ---
I mean, socks have holes,
I mean, roads have bumps,
They make meatheads champs and nice guys chumps ?
--- CHARLEY ---
? Happened!
--- MARY ---
I mean, even cream of wheat has lumps ?
--- ALL ---
Best thing that ever could have happened! ?
It was all getting much to complicated anyhow ?
Best thing that ever could have happened!
--- FRANK ---
Right, we'll do a new show ?
No, we'll do a whole batch! ?
And it's over with, I'll cut the connection ?
Gotta have endings,
Or there wouldn't be beginnings.
--- ALL ---
Right!
--- CHARLEY ---
When you're flattened this low
And you're starting from scratch,
You can only go in one direction!
--- ALL ---
The side is retired,
But there still are lots of innings,
Right?
--- GROUP I ---
Best thing that ever could have happened!
Best thing that ever could have happened!
I say, best thing that ever could have happened,
I say, best thing that ever could have happened!
It's your time, your time!
--- GROUP II ---
Yesterday is done!
See the pretty countryside!
Soon enough you're merrily, merily
Rolling along!
Rolling along!
--- GROUP III ---
You're beginning again,
Got another clean slate,
Got a whole new life,
You'll learn to adore it!
It's your time!
It's your time!
