Party!
--- FRANK ---
Life is swinging,
Skies are blue and bells are ringing.
Every day I wake up singing,
Look at me, I'm rich and happy!
--- Unknown ---
Days are sunny,
Working hard for lots of money,
Filled with people smart and funny,
Filled with people rich and happy.

Who says, "Lonely at the top"?
I say, Let it never stop!
It's my time coming through,
All my dreams are coming true:
Gorgeous house, gorgeous wife,
Who wants any more from life?
--- Unknown ---
Skies are beaming,
Future bright and prospects gleaming.
Best of all, I don't stop dreaming
Just because I'm rich
And famous
And therefore
Happy, too!
--- ALL ---
Party!
--- GUEST ---
Well, you must admit the movie's terrible ?
--- ANOTHER GUEST ---

These are the shapers,
These are the people
That fill the papers.
--- ALL ---
Terrible ?
--- MARY ---
These are the friends of Frank ?
--- ALL ---
Wasn't it just terrible?
--- MARY ---
They all have Frank to thank.
--- ALL ---
When you see a movie that bad,
What on earth can you say?
Congratulations!
--- FRANK ---
Thanks.
--- MARY ---
These are the movers,
These are the shapers,
These are the people
That give you vapors ?
--- FRANK ---
Twenty years ago who'd have guessed,
Who'd have guessed
I'd be standing here,
Playing host to the very best,
All the powers that be?
--- ALL ---
Terrible ?

Everybody I see ?

And look who's one of them ? me!

What on earth can anyone say?

Life is swinging,
Skies are blue and bells are ringing.
Every day I wake up singing,
Look at me, I'm rich and happy!
Days go zipping,
Sitting by the pool and tripping.
--- MARY ---
Everybody's flip or flipping.
Everybody's rich ?
--- ALL ---
And happy!
--- FRANK ---
Who says all our dreams get burned?
Every bit of this was earned.
It's our time coming through ?
All our dreams coming true!
ALl our days full of beans,
--- ALL ---
This must be what happy means!
--- Unknown ---
Skies are beaming,
Future bright and prospects gleaming!
Best of all, we don't stop dreaming
Just because we're rich
--- FRANK ---
And famous
--- ALL ---
And suntanned
--- FRANK ---
And influential

And on the covers of magazines
And in the columns and on the screens
And giving interviews,
Being photographed,
Making all the important scense,
And ?
At the parties cutting capers,
And on the talk shows and in the papers
And unbelieveably
