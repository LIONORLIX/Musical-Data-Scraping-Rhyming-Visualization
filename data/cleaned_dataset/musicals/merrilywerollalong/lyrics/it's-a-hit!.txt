It's a Hit!
JOE
Listen to that!
Did you listen to that?
Do you know what that means?
Let me tell you what it means ?
Wait, no, anyone who even thinks it,
Don't say it, you'll jinx it ?
--- FRANK ---
Listen to that!
Will you listen to that?
Does that make you feel proud?
Well, feel more than just proud ?
Okay, wait, I'll tempt fate,
And I'll state it out loud:
That, unless I miss my guess, is ?
I can't stand it!
Listen ?
Yes!
That's the sound of a hit!
It's a hit!
Gang, I think this is it!
No more writing clever little shows
For those basement saloons,
No more proclamations from the pros
That you can't hum the tunes ?
--- MARY ---
No more sneaking in at intermission
To the plays you wish you could afford ?
--- FRANK ---
Or producers having you audition
Whenever they're bored ?
--- CHARLEY ---
And who say
Right away
As you play
The first chord:
Boys, that's just great. But next time, don't be so clever ? 
--- ALL ---
We're a hit! We're a hit!
--- JOE ---
You're ahead, you should quit.
--- FRANK ---
No more coaching those sopranos
With voices like bees ?
--- CHARLEY ---
No more secondhand pianos
With six broken keys ?
--- MARY ---
No more agenst giving you opinions
While they turn you over to their minions ?
--- ALL ---
Just for these
Guarantees
We should please
Thank the Lord.
It's a hit! It's a hit!
--- MARY ---
Will your in-laws just spit!
After all of that baloney
They've made you go through,
All that muttering that you're a phoney,
'Cause what do you do?
Will their faces be stony
When they see on their Sony
Someone handing the phony
The Tony
Award!

(She gives Frank an umbrella to serve as a microphone.)
--- FRANK ---
I would like to begin by thanking everyone who turned down everything I have written ? so I could win this.

--- ALL ---
It's a hit!
--- JOE ---
Hold it,
Folks, there's still the reviews left,
Both the Trib and the News left
Early,
Surly ?
Not a good sign.
Also, even if there's a chance, folks,
Let's not forget the advance, folks:
Not a
Lotta
Cash, folks ?
--- CHARLEY ---
Also, even if it's a smash, folks,
Doesn't that mean we sell out?
--- JOE ---
Well, I hope we sell out ?
--- CHARLEY ---
What I mean is sell out ?
Well, you know ?
Success is like failure,
It's how you perceive it,
It's what you do with it,
Not how you achieve it
And I can't believe it's a hit!
It's a hit! It's a hit!
It's a ?
--- FRANK ---
Listen to that!
Will you listen to that?
Tell me, is that a noise
Or is that a noise?
That is a noise we've been
Waiting the whole of our lives to hear! CHARLEY
Listen to that!
Listen to that! Will you listen to that? Did you listen to that?
Buddy,
I can't Is that a noise
Or is that a noise?
Stand it! Where's the machine?
Gotta get it on tape for our wives to hear!
MARY (turns on a recorder)
Listen to that!
That's obscene!

--- ALL ---
Will you listen to that?
That's the sound of an audience losing its mind!
It's the pope on his balcony, blessing mankind!
--- JOE ---
Folks, it's Funny Girl, Fiddler, and Dolly combined!
--- ALL ---
It's a hit! It's a hit!
It's a palpable hit!
--- Unknown ---
FRANK and CHARLEY
If it only even runs a minute,
At least it's a wedge,
It's the theatre and we're really in it,
Not just on the edge!
--- JOE ---
If your spirits ever need improving,
You can drop in any night for free!
--- FRANK ---
But the thing that's positively moving ?
--- CHARLEY ---
You could have fooled me ?
--- BOTH ---
Is that we're still good friends!
Nothing can kill good friends!
Where there's a will, good friends
Don't need success to survive!
And us, good friends,
What's to discuss, good friends!
