------ Our Time ------
--- FRANK ---
Something is stirring,
Shifting ground ?
It's just begun.
Edges are blurring
All around,
And yesterday is done.
--- Unknown ---
Feel the flow,
Hear what's happening:
We're what's happening.
Don't you know?
We're the movers and we're the shapers.
We're the names in tomorrow's papers.
Up to us, man, to show 'em ?
--- It's our time, breathe it in ---
Worlds to change and worlds to win.
Our turn coming through,
Me and you, man,
Me and you!
--- Unknown ---
Feel how it quivers,
On the brink ?
--- CHARLEY ---
What?
--- FRANK ---
Everything!
Gives you the shivers,
Makes you think
There's so much stuff to sing!
--- Unknown ---
And you and me,
We'll be singing it like the birds,
Me with music and you the words,
Tell 'em things they don't know!
--- BOTH ---
Up to us, pal, to show 'em ?
--- It's our time, breathe it in ---
Worlds to change and worlds to win.
Our turn, we're what's new,
Me and you, pal,
Me and you!
--- Unknown ---
Feel the flow,
Hear what's happening:
We're what's happening!
Long ago
All we had was that funny feeling,
Saying someday we'd send 'em reeling,
Now it looks like we can! ?
--- CHARLEY ---
Someday just began ?
--- BOTH ---
It's our heads on the block.
Give us room and start the clock.
Our time coming through,
Me and you, pal,
Me and you!
Me and you!

--- FRANK, CHARLEY, MARY ---
Years from now,
We'll remember and we'll come back,
Buy the rooftop and hang a plaque:
This is where we began,
Being what we can.
--- ALL ---
It's our heads on the block,
Give us room and start the clock.
Our dreams coming true,
Me and you, pal,
Me and you!
Me and you!
Me and you!
Me and you!
Me and you!
Me and you!
Me and you!
