------ Old Friends ------
--- MARY ---
Here's to us ?
--- FRANK ---
Who's like us?
--- CHARLEY ---
Damn few.
--- FRANK ---
Hey, old friend,
Are you okay, old friend?
What do you say, old friend,
Are we or are we unique?
Time goes by,
Everything else keeps changing.
You and I,
We get continued next week.
--- Unknown ---
Most friends fade
Or they don't make the grade.
New one's are quickly made
And in a pinch, sure, they'll do.
But us, old friend,
What's to discuss, old friend?
Here's to us ? who's like us?
Damn few!
--- CHARLEY ---
So, old friends,
Fill me in slow, old friends ?
Start from hello, old friends,
I want the when, where and how.
Old friends do
Tend to become old habit ?
Never knew
How much I missed you till now.
--- ALL THREE ---
Most friends fade
Or they don't make the grade.
New ones are quickly made,
Some of them worth something, too.
But us, old friends ?
What's to discuss, old friends? ?
--- FRANK ---
Tell you something:
Good friends point out your lies,
Whereas old friends live and let live.
--- MARY ---
Good friends like and advise,
Whereas old friends love and forgive.
--- FRANK ---
And old friends let you go your own way ?
--- CHARLEY ---
Help you find your own way ?
--- MARY ---
Let you off when you're wrong ?
--- FRANK ---
If you're wrong ?
--- CHARLEY ---
When you're wrong ?
--- MARY ---
Right or wrong, the point is:
Old friends shouldn't care if you're wrong ?
--- FRANK ---
Should, but not for too long ?
--- CHARLEY ---
What's too long?
--- FRANK ---
If you're wrong ?
--- CHARLEY ---
When you're wrong ?
--- MARY ---
The thing is:
Old friends do leave their brands on you,
But old friends shouldn't compete.
--- FRANK ---
Old friends don't make demands on you ?
--- CHARLEY ---
Should make demands on you ?
--- FRANK ---
Well, don't make demands you can't meet.
--- CHARLEY ---
Well, what's the
Point of demands you can meet?
--- MARY ---
Well, there's a
Time for demands,
Whether you meet them or not ?
--- Unknown ---
(They squabble.)
--- ALL ---
Hey, old friends,
How do we stay old friends?
Who is to say, old friends,
How an old friendship survives?
One day chums
Having a laugh a minute,
One day comes
And they're a part of your lives.
--- Unknown ---
New friends pour
Through the revolving door ?
Maybe there's one that's more.
If you find one, that'll do.
But us, old friends,
What's to discuss, old friends?
Here's to us!
Who's like us?
--- Unknown ---
Two old friends,
Fewer won't do, old friends ?
Gotta have two old friends
Helping you balance along:
One upbraids you
For your faults and fancies,
One persuades you
That the other one's wrong.
--- Unknown ---
Most friends fade
Or they don't make the grade.
New ones are quickly made,
Perfect as long as they're new.
But us, old friends,
What's to discuss, old friends?
Here's to us!
Who's like us?
