------ Start of Something New ------
--- Unknown ---
Living in my own world
Didn't understand
That anything can happen
When you take a chance
I never believed in
What I couldn't see
I never opened my heart
To all the possibilities
I know that something has changed
Never felt this way
And right here tonight
--- Unknown ---
This could be the start
Of something new
It feels so right
To be here with you ..oh
And now ... looking in your eyes
I feel in my heart
The start of something new
--- Unknown ---
Now who'd of ever thought that
We'd both be here tonight
And the world looks so much brighter
With you by my side
I know that something has changed
Never felt this way
I know it for real
--- Unknown ---
This could be the start
Of something new
It feels so right
To be here with you
And now looking in your eyes
I feel in my heart
The start of something new
--- Unknown ---
I never knew that it could happen
Till it happened to me
I didn't know it before
But now it's easy to see
--- Unknown ---
It's a start
Of something new
It feels so right
To be here with you
And now looking in your eyes
I feel in my heart
--- Unknown ---
That it's the start
Of something new
It feels so right
To be here with you
And now looking in your eyes
I feel in my heart
The start of something new
