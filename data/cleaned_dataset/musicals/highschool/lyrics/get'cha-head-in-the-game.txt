------ Get'cha Head in the Game ------
--- Unknown ---
Coach said to fake right
And break left
Watch out for the pick
And keep an eye on defense
Gotta run the give and go
And take the ball to the hole
But don't be afraid
To shoot the outside J
--- Unknown ---
Just keep ya head in the game
Just keep ya head in the game
--- Unknown ---
And don't be afraid
To shoot the outside J
Just keep ya head in the game
--- Unknown ---
U gotta
Get'cha get'cha head in the game
We gotta
Get our, get our, get our, get our head in the game
--- Unknown ---
Let's make sure
That we get the rebound
'Cause when we get it
Then the crowd will go wild
A second chance
Gotta grab it and go
Maybe this time
We'll hit the right notes
--- Unknown ---
Wait a minute
It's not the time or place
Wait a minute
Get my head in the game
Wait a minute
Get my head in the game
Wait a minute
Wait a minute
--- Unknown ---
I gotta
Get my, get my head in the game
You gotta
Get'cha, get'cha, get'cha, get'cha head in the game
--- Unknown ---
Why am I feeling so wrong
My head's in the game
But my heart's in the song
She makes this feel so right
--- Unknown ---
(SPOKEN)
Should I go for it
Better shake this, yikes!
--- Unknown ---
I gotta
Get my, get my head in the game
You gotta
Get'cha, get'cha, get'cha, get'cha head in the game
