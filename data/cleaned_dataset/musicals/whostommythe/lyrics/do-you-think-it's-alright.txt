------ Do You Think It's Alright ------
--- Unknown ---
Do you think it's alright
To leave the boy with Uncle Ernie?
Do you think it's alright
He's had a few too many tonight
Do you think it's alright? I think it's alright
--- Unknown ---
I'm your wicked Uncle Ernie
I'm glad you won't see or hear me
As I fiddle about, fiddle about, fiddle about
--- Unknown ---
Your mother left me here to mind you
Now I'm doing what I want to
Fiddling about, fiddling about, fiddle about
--- Unknown ---
Down with the bedclothes
Up with your nightshirt
Fiddle about, fiddle about, fiddle about
--- Unknown ---
Fiddle about, fiddle about, fiddle about
--- Unknown ---
You won't shout as I fiddle about
Fiddle about, fiddle about, fiddle about
Fiddle about, fiddle about, fiddle about
--- Unknown ---
Fiddle about, fiddle about, fiddle about
Fiddle about, fiddle about, fiddle about
