------ Smash The Mirror ------
--- Mother ---
--- Unknown ---
You don't answer my call
With even a nod or a wink
But you gaze at your own reflection!
You don't seem to see me
But I think you can see yourself.
How can the mirror affect you?
--- Unknown ---
Can you hear me
Or do I surmise?
That you fear me can you feel my temper
RISE RISE RISE RISE RISE RISE
RISE RISE RISE RISE RISE RISE RISE
--- Unknown ---
Do you hear or fear or
Do I smash the mirror?
Do you hear of fear or
