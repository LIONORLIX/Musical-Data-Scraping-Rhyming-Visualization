He seems to be completely unreceptive.
The tests I gave him show no sense at all.
His eyes react to light the dials detect it.
He hears but cannot answer to your call.

See me, feel me, touch me, heal me.
See me, feel me, touch me, heal me.
--- Doctor ---
--- Unknown ---
There is no chance no untried operation.
All hope lies with him and none with me.
Imagine though the shock from isolation.
When he suddenly can hear and speak and see.

See me, feel me, touch me, heal me.
See me, feel me, touch me, heal me.
--- Doctor ---

His eyes can see
his ears can hear his lips speak
All the time the needles flick and rock.
No machine can give the kind of stimulation,
Needed to remove his inner block.
--- Unknown ---
Go to the mirror boy!
Go to the mirror boy!

I often wonder what he's feeling.
Has he ever heard a word I've said?
Look at him now in the mirror dreaming
What is happening in his head?
--- Tommy ---
--- Unknown ---
Listening to you I get the music.
Gazing at you I get the heat
Following you I climb the mountain
I get excitement at your feet!
--- Unknown ---
Right behind you I see the millions
On you I see the glory.
From you I get the opinions
From you I get the story.
