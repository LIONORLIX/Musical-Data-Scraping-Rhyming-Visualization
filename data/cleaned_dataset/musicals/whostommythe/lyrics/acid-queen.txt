------ Acid Queen ------
--- Unknown ---
If your child ain't all he should be now
This girl could put him right.
I'll show him what he could be now
Just give me one night.
I'm the Gypsy - the acid queen.
Pay before we start.
I'm the Gypsy - I'm guaranteed.
I'll tear your soul apart.
--- Unknown ---
Give us a room, close the door
Leave us for a while.
Your boy won't be a boy no more
Young, but not a child.
I'm the Gypsy - the acid queen.
Pay before we start.
The Gypsy - I'm guaranteed.
I'll tear your soul apart.
--- Unknown ---
Gather your wits and hold on fast,
Your mind must learn to roam.
Just as the Gypsy Queen must do
You're gonna hit the road.
--- Unknown ---
When the work is done,
You look at him,
He'll never be more alive.
Watch his body writhe!
I'm the Gypsy - the acid queen.
Pay before we start.
I'm the Gypsy - I'm guaranteed.
To break your little heart.
