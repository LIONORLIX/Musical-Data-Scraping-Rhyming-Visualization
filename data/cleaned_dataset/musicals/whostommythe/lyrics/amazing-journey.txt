------ Amazing Journey ------
--- Unknown ---
Deaf, dumb and blind boy
He's in a quiet vibration land.
Strange as it seems, his musical dreams
Ain't quite so bad.
--- Unknown ---
Ten years old with thoughts as bold as thoughts can be.
Loving life and becoming wise
In simplicity.
--- Unknown ---
Sickness will surely take the mind
Where minds can't usually go.
Come on the amazing journey
And learn all you should know.
--- Unknown ---
A vague haze of delerium
Creeps up on me.
All at once a tall stranger I suddenly see.
He's dressed in a silver sparkled
Glittering gown
And his golden beard flows
Nearly down to the ground.
--- Unknown ---
Nothing to say and nothing to hear
And nothing to see.
Each sensation makes a note
In my symphony.
--- Unknown ---
Sickness will surely take the mind
Where minds can't usually go.
Come on the amazing journey
And learn all you should know.
--- Unknown ---
His eyes are the eyes that
Transmit all they know.
Sparkle warm crystaline glances to show
That he is your leader
And he is your guide
On the amazing journey
