------ Sally Simpson's Question ------
--- Unknown ---
How can we share the great sights you are seeing?
Hear all the glorious music you hear?
--- Unknown ---
How can we be a small part of your being?
Why do you seem so alive when you're near?
--- Unknown ---
Tell us. Tell us now. How can we be more like you?
--- Unknown ---
Why would you want to be more like me?
For fifteen years I was waiting for what you've already got.
--- Unknown ---
What's that?
--- Unknown ---
All this. In my dreams I was seeing it,
hearing it, feeling it. Those are
the true miracles and you have them already.
--- Unknown ---
I don't understand.
--- Unknown ---
The point is not for you to be more like me.
The point is...I'm finally more like you.
