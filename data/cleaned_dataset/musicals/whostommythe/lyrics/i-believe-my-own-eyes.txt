This can't continue, It makes no sense
We're getting nowhere, I've lost all my confidence
The boy wants something, I'm satisfied
He needs attention and care our love can't provide
And then there's the matter of us.
--- Unknown ---
I'd like to prove that I don't feel that you've seen the best of me
I've stood up for the boy and I've clung to the hopes and the lies
I wish that the pain in your gaze could again be a test of me
But when I look in the mirror
I believe my own eyes.
--- Unknown ---
I believe my own eyes
Know I've come to the end
All my patience is gone
When I'm doubtful I tend
To believe my own eyes
--- Unknown ---
I'd like to declare this devotion and care is the life to live
That nothing has changed and that time isn't passing us by
But I have to say here that for us,
There's a clear-cut alternative
When we look at each other, we believe our own eyes.
--- Unknown ---
I believe my own eyes
Know I've come to the end
All my patience is gone
When I'm doubtful I tend
To believe my own eyes.
--- Unknown ---
This has gone far enough
After all we've been through
We can't be blamed,
We've done all we can humanly do
It's a time to be tough
A time to be wise
We must stop chasing false dreams,
And recover our lives.
--- Unknown ---
I believe my own eyes
Know I've come to the end
All my patience is gone
When I'm doubtful I tend
To believe...
--- Unknown ---
I'd like to believe that I don't feel that we've seen the best of us
And the way to believe is to see where the real future lies
I hope that the pain in your gaze can again be a test of us
But when I look in the mirror
I belive my own eyes
--- Unknown ---
Let's believe our own eyes
Know we've come to the end
All our patience is gone
Let's admit we intend
To believe our own eyes
To believe our own eyes
