------ Our Little Secret ------
--- Unknown ---
All the other apples
Are spoiled and they're rotten
Out of the basket they'll go
--- Unknown ---
Your loyalty is something
That won't be forgotten
--- Unknown ---
And there's one thing I promise you
I can keep secrets too
--- Unknown ---
Oh, it's our little secret
Little secret, little secret
--- Unknown ---
I'm gonna buy me a hat
And keep our secret under that
--- Unknown ---
It's our little secret
Little secret, little secret
--- Unknown ---
I'll even stop counting sheep
To prove I don't talk when I sleep
--- Unknown ---
We've got a little plot that we can tell
Just one another
There's isn't anyone that we can trust
Except each other
--- Unknown ---
That's why we'll never tell a soul
What it's all about
They'll never get a chance to find out
--- Unknown ---
There'll be questions
I won't answer
There'll be gossip
Let them gossip
We don't care
Just put your trust in me
--- Unknown ---
It's our little secret
And I'll keep it locked inside me
'Cause it's no one else's business
But our own anyhow
--- Unknown ---
'Cause it's no one else's business
But our own anyhow
--- Unknown ---
Our little secret
Oh, yes, it's yours and mine
Our little secret
For now and all the time
We'll stick together
To keep our little secret now
