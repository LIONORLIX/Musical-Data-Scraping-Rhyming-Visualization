It's turkey lurkey time
Tom turkey ran away but he just came home
It's turkey lurkey time
He's really home to stay, never one to roam

Let us make a wish
And may all our wishes come true
A snowy, blowy Christmas
A mistletoey Christmas
A turkey lurkey Christmas to you
A turkey lurkey Christmas to you

It's loosey goosey time
She was a gadabout but she's back again
It's loosey goosey time
Her time is running out and we all know when
--- Unknown ---
Let us make a wish
And may all our wishes come true
A snowy, blowy Christmas
A mistletoey Christmas
A loosey goosey Christmas to you
A loosey goosey Christmas to you

Turkey lurkey, loosey goosey
Some for uncle Joe, some for cousin Lucy
Everybody gather 'round the table
Dig in, dinner's being served
Eat all the turkey you are able

Can't you see a partridge in a pear tree?
Climb up and bring it down for me
That's something I would like to see
--- Unknown ---
A snowy, blowy Christmas
A mistletoey Christmas
A turkey lurkey Christmas to you
You, you, you
