------ I Say A Little Prayer ------
--- Unknown ---
The moment I wake up
Before I put on my make-up
I say a little prayer for you
--- Unknown ---
While combin' my hair now
And wonderin' what dress to wear now
I say a little prayer for you
--- Unknown ---
Oh, forever, forever, you'll stay in my heart
And I will love you
Forever and ever, we never will part
Oh, how I love you
--- Unknown ---
Together, together, that's how it must be
To live without you
Would only mean heartbreak for me
--- Unknown ---
I run for the bus, dear
While ridin' I think of us, dear
I say a little prayer for you
--- Unknown ---
At work I just take time
And all through my coffee-break time
I say a little prayer for you
--- Unknown ---
Oh, forever, forever, you'll stay in my heart
And I will love you
Forever and ever, we never will part
Oh, how I'll love you
--- Unknown ---
Together, together, that's how it must be
To live without you
Would only mean heartbreak for me
--- Unknown ---
My darling, believe me
For me there is no one but you
Please love me too
I'm in love with you
Answer my prayer
