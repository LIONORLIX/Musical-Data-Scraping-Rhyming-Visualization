------ Whoever You Are ------
--- Unknown ---
Sometimes your eyes look blue to me
Although I know they're really green
I seem to see you differently
Changing as I'm treated kindly
Or treated meanly
--- Unknown ---
From moment to moment
You're two different people
Faithful and warm when I'm in your arms
And then when you leave
You're so untrue
--- Unknown ---
But however you are
Deep down, whatever you are
Whoever you are, I love you
--- Unknown ---
Sometimes I feel you're mine alone
And yet I'm sure it's just not so
I get this feeling on my own
After I've learnt if you're staying
Or if you're going
--- Unknown ---
From moment to moment
You're two different people
Someone I know as the man I love
Or the man I wish
I never knew
--- Unknown ---
But however you are
Deep down, whatever you are
Whoever you are, I love you
--- Unknown ---
Sometimes your eyes look blue to me
