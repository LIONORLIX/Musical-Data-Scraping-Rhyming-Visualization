------ You'll Think Of Someone ------
--- Fran ---
I could take up knitting to feel better
I'd make someone a hand-knit sweater
But I just don't know who that someone should be
--- Chuck ---
If you can't think of anyone else
How about maybe, someone
Like for example, perhaps, someone
Oh, you'll think of someone
--- Fran ---
I could take up tennis to relax me
A game of doubles wouldn't tax me
But I just don't know who my partner should be
--- Chuck ---
If you can't think of anyone else
How about maybe, someone
Like for example, perhaps, someone
Oh, you'll think of someone
--- Both ---
Who likes you and the things you like to do
Happy little things like climbing hills
And rowing boats on a lake
Fun is something that is yours to take
--- Fran ---
I could take up painting to amuse me
A portrait picture might enthuse me
But I just don't know who my model should be
--- Chuck ---
You can bet there's someone around
--- Fran ---
Someone to talk to, laugh with
Like for example dance with, sing to...
--- Chuck ---
Cling to...
When you think about that someone
Who could it be
How about me?
