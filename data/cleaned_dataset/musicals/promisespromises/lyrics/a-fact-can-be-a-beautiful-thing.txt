And a fact can be a beautiful thing
When the fact I'm facin' is you
A fact can be a terrible thing
When the dreams you've been dreaming fall through
--- Unknown ---
Forget the past
And think about the present
Right now is everything
--- Unknown ---
Forget the past
And think about the present
The present's very pleasant

There's just no predicting a thing
Don't wait for a miracle

Because it's Christmas
Not a time to be
Alone with memories

Christmas
It's supposed to be a happy holiday
Throw a little joy my way
You could really make my day
Throw a little joy my way
--- Unknown ---
And a fact can be a beautiful thing
When I see what I'm seein' in you
A fact can be a wonderful thing
When your hopes to be happy come true

What's gone is gone
And don't you ever doubt it
Wake up and start to live

What's gone is gone
So learn to live without it
And never think about it
