------ Upstairs ------
--- Chuck ---
Upstairs - two flights up
Looking out on the street
For eighty-six fifty a month it's mine
It may not be much but it's mine
--- Unknown ---
You just go upstairs, two flights up
Comfortable and complete
For every-day living it works out fine
It may not be much, but it's mine
--- Unknown ---
Except on Wednesday night
It's walk, don't run
I just kill time till Mister Kirkeby's done
With his Wednesday night fun
Outside of that place is mine
--- Unknown ---
Upstairs two flights up
Looking out on the street
For eighty-six fifty a month it's mine
It may not be much but it's mine
