------ Knowing When To Leave ------
--- Unknown ---
Go while the going is good
Knowing when to leave
May be the smartest thing that anyone can learn
Go
--- Unknown ---
I'm afraid my heart
Isn't very smart
--- Unknown ---
Fly while your still have your wings
Knowing when to leave
Will never let you reach the point of no return
Fly
--- Unknown ---
Foolish as it seems
I still have my dreams
--- Unknown ---
So I keep hoping
Day after day as I wait for the man I meet
Night after night as I wish for a love that can be
--- Unknown ---
Though I'm sure that
No one can tell where their wishes and hopes will lead
Somehow I feel there is happiness just waiting there for me
--- Unknown ---
When someone
Walks in your life, you'd just better be sure he's right
'Cause if he's wrong, there are heartaches and tears you must pay
--- Unknown ---
Keep both of your
Eyes on the door, never let it get out of sight
Just be prepared when the time has come for you to run away
--- Unknown ---
Sail when the wind starts to blow
But like a fool, I don't know
When to leave
--- Unknown ---
