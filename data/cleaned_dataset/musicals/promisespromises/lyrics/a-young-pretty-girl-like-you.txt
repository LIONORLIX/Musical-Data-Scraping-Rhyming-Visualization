Put my glasses out
On the top of your head
On the top of your head
You won't see a thing
--- Unknown ---
And the less you see
The sooner you'll be
Smiling, laughing
And happy, oh, yes
--- Unknown ---
The less you see
The better you feel
The better you feel
The quicker you smile
--- Unknown ---
And the quicker you smile
The sooner you'll be happy
Happy
--- Unknown ---
And a young pretty girl like you
Pretty as she can be
Really should be happy
Happy
--- Unknown ---
Try to take my stethoscope
Plug it into your ears
Plug it into your ears
You won't hear a thing
Hello, hello
--- Unknown ---
When there's too much noise
Nobody enjoys
Smiling, laughing
And happy, oh yes
--- Unknown ---
And the less you see
The better you feel
The better you feel
The quicker you smile
--- Unknown ---
And the quicker you smile
The sooner you'll be happy
Happy
--- Unknown ---
And a young pretty girl like you
Pretty as she can be
Really should be happy
Happy
--- Unknown ---
Try to open up your mouth
Let me look at your throat
Let me look at your throat
Don't you say a thing
--- Unknown ---
'Cause the less you say
The sooner you'll play
Lipstick, powder
And girl-games, oh yes
--- Unknown ---
And the less you see
The better you feel
The better you feel
The quicker you smile
--- Unknown ---
And the quicker you smile
The sooner you'll be happy
Happy
--- Unknown ---
And a young pretty girl like you
Why don't you take a look?
Really should be happy
Happy
--- Unknown ---
Yes, a young pretty girl like you
With all you've been through
Really should be happy
Smiling, laughing, giggling
