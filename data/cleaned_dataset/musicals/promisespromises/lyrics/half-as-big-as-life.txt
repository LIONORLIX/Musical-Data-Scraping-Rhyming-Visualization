------ Half As Big As Life ------
--- Chuck ---
Did you ever stop, really stop, and take a look
Take a look, take a really good luck at yourself?
--- Unknown ---
I just took a peek, really peeked, to tell the truth
Through my eyes, I don't look so good to myself
--- Unknown ---
Half as big as life, that's me
But that's not the way I always mean to be
Half as big as life, that's small
But deep in my heart I can feel
That I'm ten feet tall - ten feet tall
--- Unknown ---
I know that
Inside of myself there's a man, the kind of man
You would like, if you were just willing to look
--- Unknown ---
I've got lots of dreams
And my dreams will take me far
Very far, a cover is not the whole book
--- Unknown ---
Half as big as life, they say
But they're gonna see how wrong they are
Someday
Half as big as life, that's small
But I wasn't born to be looked at
As five feet tall, no, not me
--- Unknown ---
I want a lot
And I know that I'll get it all
Just like someone who's
Twice as big as life
