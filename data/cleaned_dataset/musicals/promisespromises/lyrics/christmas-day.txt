------ Christmas Day ------
--- Unknown ---
Christmas Day is here and so are we
Time for children and presents
And Christmas tree happiness
--- Unknown ---
Christmas Day is all that it should be
Lights and carols and holly
And all kinds of loveliness
--- Unknown ---
Christmas bells
Ringing out goodwill to men
And peace on earth
Everything they taught you when
You were a child
The things a Child once taught the world
--- Unknown ---
If Christmas day is really in your heart
You don't have to save up
All your love to give once a year
--- Unknown ---
Try to give, learn to live
Each day like Christmas Day
--- Unknown ---
A chair is still a chair
