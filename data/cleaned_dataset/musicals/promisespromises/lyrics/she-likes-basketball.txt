------ She Likes Basketball ------
--- Unknown ---
She likes basketball, how about that?
We've got something in common to talk about
Basketball
--- Unknown ---
She likes basketball, how about that?
I have some place to take her when we go out
Basketball
--- Unknown ---
Whoever would've dreamed, ever would've thought?
That my favorite girl likes my favorite sport
Like any other kid, I would make-believe
With a ball in my hand
--- Unknown ---
I'd dribble right past
All the others real fast
And I'd be six-foot eight
And my jump shot was really great
--- Unknown ---
She likes basketball, isn't that wild?
It's an omen that good things are on their way
Things to share
--- Unknown ---
We share basketball, couldn't you die?
From a simple beginning like this
We may get somewhere
It's nice to dream
Someday it might be, basketball and me
