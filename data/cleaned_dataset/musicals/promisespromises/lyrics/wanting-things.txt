------ Wanting Things ------
--- Unknown ---
Tell me how long must I keep
Wanting things
Needing things
When I have so much?
--- Unknown ---
There are many men
Who have much less than me
Day by day, they make their way
And they find more in life than I can see
--- Unknown ---
Tell me when will I learn to resist
Wanting things
Touching things
That say, Do, do not touch
--- Unknown ---
People that I meet
Seem to think I am strong
They don't see inside of me
So they don't know I'm weak and often wrong
Tell me
--- Unknown ---
Oh, oh
Wanting things
Oh, oh
--- Unknown ---
There are many men
Who have much less than me
Day by day, they make their way
And they find more in life than I can see
--- Unknown ---
Tell me why must I keep
Wanting things
Needing things
That just can't be mine
Oh, wanting things
