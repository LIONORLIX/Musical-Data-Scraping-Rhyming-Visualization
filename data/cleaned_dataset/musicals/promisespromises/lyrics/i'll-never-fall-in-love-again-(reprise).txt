------ I'll Never Fall In Love Again (reprise) ------
--- Unknown ---
Don't tell me what it's all about
'cause I've been there and I'm glad I'm out
Out of those chains, those chains that bind you
That is why I'm here to remind you
--- Unknown ---
What do you get when you fall in love?
You only get lies and pain and sorrow
So far at least until tomorrow
I'll never fall in love a- gain
No, no, I'll never fall in love again
