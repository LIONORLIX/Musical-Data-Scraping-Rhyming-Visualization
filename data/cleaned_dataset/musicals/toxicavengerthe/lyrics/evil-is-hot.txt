--- Mayor ---
These two breasts can be yours
You cant buy them in stores
Go ahead take a bite
Just tell me, what’s his kryptonite?
--- Professor ---
I wont stand here and squeal
Though I want like a feel
Oh, my brain’s in a knot
Why is evil so hot?
Evil is hot
--- Mayor ---
Evil is hot
--- Both ---
Don’t tell me that its not
Cause evil is hot
--- Mayor ---
I am woman
--- Professor ---
And I am man
--- Mayor ---
I am straight
--- Professor ---
And I am too except for that one time in college
So let’s do the dance of the doomed
--- Mayor ---
And get tanked up on shrooms
Evil is hot
--- Professor ---
Evil is hot
--- Both ---
Together we’ll find that spot
Where evil is hot
--- Professor ---
Bleach.
--- Mayor ---
What?
--- Professor ---
Throw bleach on him. he’ll melt faster than the wicked witch of the west.
--- Mayor ---
That’s all? Household bleach?
--- Professor ---
I said it, now go! Go do your evil, damn it.
--- Mayor ---
Ha, ha, ha, ha!
--- Professor ---
Ha, ha, ha, ha!
--- Mayor ---
What the hell has evil got that makes it so hot?
--- Both ---
Damn it, it’s hot!
So freaking hot
Tonight we’ll hit the jackpot
Cause evil is hot
Is hot
Is hot
Evil is hot!
