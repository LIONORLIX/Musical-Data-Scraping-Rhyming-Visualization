------ Everybody Dies! ------

She pegged me for a fool
Now she’s left me behind
How could I not see it coming’
How could I be so blind’
They all call me a freak
Well this freak just got screwed
So it’s time to adopt a more
Monstrous attitude
--- Unknown ---
Right here right now, surprise
Everybody dies
--- Unknown ---
Don’t wanna hear no wimpy alibis
The freak is gonna get the good guys
Tromaville has met its demise
Cause everybody dies
--- Unknown ---
Everyone alive qualifies
I kill ministers and priests and rabbis
I aint gonna win the nobel peace prize
Everybody dies
Everybody dies
Everyone alive qualifies
--- Man ---
Judy, what should we do for our one month anniversary’
--- Woman ---
Oh, Nicky. Let’s go see a musical.
A wonderful musical based on a movie most people watched when they were stoned.
--- Toxie ---
This family’s wearing no disguise
I wanna see the fear in your eyes
It’s time to say your final goodbyes
Cause everybody’leave
I said leave
