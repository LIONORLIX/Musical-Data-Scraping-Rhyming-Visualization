------ Bitch/Slut/Liar/Whore ------
--- Mother Ferd ---
I hated you in grammar school
I hated you in high school
And if we went to college, I’d hate you there too
You’re a bitch, you’re a slut
You’re a liar, you’re a whore
Did I leave something out’
Let me think some more
You’re a tart, you’re a tramp
You’re as cheap as Demi Moore
Guess who won this round’
Snap, snap, score
Biotch, slut, liar, whore
--- Mayor ---
Your sonny boy will soon go bust
Your sonny boy will eat my dust
You better tell me where he’s at
And what’s more
You’re a bitch, you’re a slut
You’re a liar, you’re a whore
You’re a petulant hustler and old dinosaur
‘‘‘‘‘
Guess who won this round’
Snap, snap, snap, snap, snap
--- Mother Ferd ---
You stay away from my Melvin!
--- Mayor ---
Go to hell!
--- Mother Ferd ---
Get another face lift!
--- Mayor ---
Oh no, she didn’t!
--- Mother Ferd ---
Oh yes, she did!
--- Both ---
You’re a bitch, you’re a slut
You’re a liar, you’re a whore
You bitch, you slut
You liar, you whore
