------ A Brand New Day in New Jersey ------
--- White Dude ---
Global warming’s up ahead
The experts think we’ll all be dead
But they don’t know we’re here to fight
--- Black Dude ---
Corporations are full of fiends
A hurricane wiped out New Orleans
Just one guy who can make things right
--- Mother Ferd ---
He used to be weak and shy
But now he takes command
--- Sarah ---
Oh, God how I love my
Macho, monster man
--- All ---
It’s a brand new day in New Jersey
There is new air in the sky
You can breathe now in New Jersey
So you won’t catch cancer and die
No, you won’t catch cancer and die
--- Toxie ---
The first bill that I plan to pass
Pollute the earth, and I’ll kick your ass
Yeah, that seems like a damn good place to start
--- All ---
Place to start, ooh!
--- Unknown ---
The second thing and this I mean
Love your brother, be him brown or green
Or I will rip your face apart
--- All ---
Right apart
--- Toxie ---
Together we will turn this state into a promise
--- Sarah ---
And you and I will walk hand in sloppy hand
--- All ---
It’s a brand new day in New Jersey
We got everything we want
No more garbage in New Jersey
Cause we dump it in Vermont
Yeah, we dump it in Vermont
--- Kid ---
It’s a brand new day
It’s a brand new day
It’s a brand new day
It’s a brand new day in New Jersey
--- All ---
It’s a brand new day
It’s a brand new day
It’s a brand new day
It’s a brand new day in New Jersey
It’s a brand new day
It’s a brand new day
It’s a brand new day
It’s a brand new day in New Jersey
It’s a brand new day
It’s a brand new day
It’s a brand new day
It’s a brand new day in New Jersey
Jersey!
