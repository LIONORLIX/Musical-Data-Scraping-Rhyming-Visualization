------ Hot Toxic Love ------
--- Toxie ---
I always dreamed I’d find someone
But that was some fantasy
I’d meet a girl and she’d up and run
Love wanted no part of me
--- Unknown ---
Then, I met you
Beautiful you
A true scientific breakthrough
--- Unknown ---
Look deep inside
I have nothing to hide
You see the real me
I’m yours honestly
You make me combust
With chemical lust
I’m just so scared of
My hot toxic
Hot toxic love
--- Sarah ---
I spend my life in the dark
Stuck in a long lonely night
You came along and lit a spark
Now, finally I see the light
--- Unknown ---
All cause of you
Beautiful you
A man who’s too good to be true
--- Unknown ---
I see deep inside
You have nothing to hide
I know who you are
You’re my shining star
You make my heart beat
With nuclear heat
Now, don’t be scared of
My hot toxic
Hot toxic love
--- Both ---
When you think of it
We’re a perfect fit
Were both a little offbeat
--- Sarah ---
I’m what you called blind
--- Toxie ---
I’m more Frankenstein
--- Both ---
Yet, somehow you make me complete
Look deep inside
I have nothing to hide
You see the real me
I’m yours honestly
You make me combust
With chemical lust
Don’t be scared of
My hot toxic
Hot toxic
Look deep inside
I have nothing to hide
You see real me
I’m yours honestly
You make me combust
With chemical lust
Now, don’t be scared of
My hot toxic
Hot toxic love
--- Sarah ---
My hot toxic
--- Toxie ---
My hot toxic
--- Both ---
Love
