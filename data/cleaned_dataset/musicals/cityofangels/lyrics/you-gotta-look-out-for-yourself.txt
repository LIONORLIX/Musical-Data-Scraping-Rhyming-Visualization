------ You Gotta Look Out For Yourself ------
--- JIMMY & ANGEL CITY FOUR ---
Ya gotta look out for yourself
If you're hoping to be first
Then ya better think me first
Or you're gonna finish last
--- Unknown ---
Ya gotta look out for yourself
If you follow this format
You'll be nobody's doormat
It's a rule that's hard and fast
--- Unknown ---
This world ain't pure
On this you can depend
You best be sure
That you're your own best friend
--- Unknown ---
Ya gotta look out for yourself
If you're planning to do good
Then be sure it does you good
You don't wanna be too good
--- Unknown ---
Ya gotta look out for yourself
Ya know the score when you adore yourself
When you're in danger you can count on me to shout
