------ Ev'rybody's Gotta Be Somewhere ------
--- Unknown ---
Angel City 4 Quartet
On the loose and so elusive
You won't find her till you've checked
Ev'ry avenue
Like a diamond
In a coal mine
She's where you would least expect
--- Unknown ---
Try to track her down
Go over the whole darn town
Go on a fishin'
Expedition
Everybody's gotta be somewhere
--- Unknown ---
Girls don't vanish in thin air
Everybody's gotta be somewhere
But where? Where? Where? Where?
--- Unknown ---
Take a little looksee
Nose around
There's an underground crowd to scout
Use a little intuition if you wish
Your mission to pan out
Keep an open ear and
Trust your gut
Let the scuttlebutt cross your mind
If you're out of innuendo `round the bend
Are hits you've yet to find
--- Unknown ---
Stone
Stay right on her trail

Quartet
Don't be so low keyed
Start following every lead
Don't put your feet up
Turn the heat up
Everybody's gotta be somewhere
--- Unknown ---
Girls don't vanish in thin air
First ya gotta look left
Then ya gotta look right
Then ya better look high and low
Gotta run around town
Gotta play the old game
It's a little like tic tac toe
--- Unknown ---
Stone
Where's that dame
Where's she gone to
She's a flame
That you're drawn to
--- Unknown ---
Where I wonder am I gonna find this chick
It's quite a blunder to underestimate her
She's a stye in the eye of a private dick
She look familiar?
--- Unknown ---
Porno Vendor
You don't know how many women I see each day
Beneath innumerable guys
Yours would be hard to forget I regret to say
She's one I never laid my eyes on
--- Unknown ---
Stone
Where I wonder am I gonna find this chick
It's quite a blunder to underestimate her
She's a stye in the eye of a private dick
She look familiar?
--- Unknown ---
Madam
Though I've never seen her
I've seen girls like these so young and ripe
Your missing miss is not the type
To miss a miss demeanor
Why-doncha Why-doncha Why-doncha
Let me choose a change of pace for broads like this
You came
To the right place
--- Unknown ---
Stone
Where's that dame
Where's she gone
--- Unknown ---
Two B Girls
You're quite a masterful detective
And it's your lucky day to stumble on us
It hardly seems at random
You're wise to scrutinize us
We won't refuse
So take off your shoes
We'll search for cues in tandem
--- Unknown ---
Quartet
Try to track her down
Go over the whole town
Better hope `n both eyes open
--- Unknown ---
Girls don't vanish in thin air
She's lying low you're flying blind but
Ev'rybody's gotta be somewhere
