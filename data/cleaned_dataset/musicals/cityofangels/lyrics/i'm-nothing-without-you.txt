------ I'm Nothing Without You ------
--- STINE & STONE ---
I'm nothing without you
Without you i lack what it takes
Unless we're combined
I have half a mind
To blow all my chances and breaks
--- Unknown ---
(STINE hands STONE the gun; STONE hands STINE a pencil)
--- Unknown ---
Without you i'm bupkis
A flop who keeps dropping the ball
It's time to stop quaking
Start taking the lead
And you are the singular buddy i need
--- Unknown ---
I'm nothing without you
Without you i'm nothing...
--- Unknown ---
(STONE gestures "Wait!," X's to the desk, sits at the typewriter)
--- STONE ---
Let's give this a Hollywood ending!
--- Unknown ---
(HE strikes a few keys on the typewriter
and the giant doors at the back of the sound stage open to admit GABBY,
who joins them, to the delight of the COMPANY, now unfrozen)
--- STINE, STONE & GABBY ---
I'm nothing without you
--- STONE ---
No hero
--- STINE ---
A zero
--- STINE & STONE ---
That's me
--- GABBY ---
With you by my side
--- STONE ---
There's no better guide
--- ALL THREE ---
On how to be all i can be
--- Unknown ---
I'm nowhere without you
To doubt you is where i went wrong
--- Unknown ---
The script calls for fusing and using our smarts
And greatness can come from the sum of our parts
--- ALL ---
From now and with on i'm with you
