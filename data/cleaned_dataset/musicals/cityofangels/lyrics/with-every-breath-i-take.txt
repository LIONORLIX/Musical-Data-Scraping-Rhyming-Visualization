------ With Every Breath I Take ------
--- BOBBI ---
There's not a morning that i open up my eyes
And find i didn't dream of you
Without a warning, though it's never a surprise
Soon as i awake
Thoughts of you arise
With ev'ry breath i take
--- Unknown ---
At any time
Or place
I close my eyes and see your face
And i'm embracing you
If only i believed that dreams come true
--- Unknown ---
Darling,
You were the one who said forever from the start
And i've been drifting since you've gone
Out on a lonely sea that only you can chart
I've been going on
Knowing that my heart will break
With ev'ry breath i take
--- Unknown ---
You were the one who said forever from the start
And i've been drifting since you've gone
Out on a lonely sea that only you can chart
I've been going on
Knowing that my heart will break
