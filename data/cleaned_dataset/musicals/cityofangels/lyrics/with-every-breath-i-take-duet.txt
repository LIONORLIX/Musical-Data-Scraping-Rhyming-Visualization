------ With Every Breath I Take-Duet ------
--- Unknown ---
Stone
I try to tell myself
To let the memory of you die slow
Y letting time be my friend
By letting go of what was
The pain would end
It never does
--- Unknown ---
Bobbi
At any time or place
I close my eyes and
See your face
and I'm embracing you
If only I believed
That
Dreams
Come true
Dar-
ling
You were the one who said
Forever from the
Start
And I've been drifting
Since you've gone
--- Unknown ---
Out on a lonely sea that only
You can chart
I've been going on, knowing
That my
Heart
Will
Break
--- Unknown ---
With every
Breath
I
Take
Stone:
--- Unknown ---
At any time or place
--- Unknown ---
I close my eyes
--- Unknown ---
And see
--- Unknown ---
Your face
--- Unknown ---
And
--- Unknown ---
I'm embrac-
--- Unknown ---
ing you
--- Unknown ---
If
--- Unknown ---
On-ly
--- Unknown ---
I be-
--- Unknown ---
lieved that
--- Unknown ---
Dreams
--- Unknown ---
Come
--- Unknown ---
True
--- Unknown ---
At
--- Unknown ---
Night out loud I pray
--- Unknown ---
Bobbi, go away
--- Unknown ---
How much must I take
--- Unknown ---
To end this ache
I
Wel-
come
Death
With every breath
I
take
