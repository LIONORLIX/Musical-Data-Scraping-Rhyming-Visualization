------ Epilogue ------
--- Unknown ---
Stone
You only go around once
And then they luck you in with a spade
You're either under the gun
Or unafraid
Any fool with a stand in
Can sit back and survive
You better do your own stunts
Or spend a lifetime buried alive
--- Unknown ---
You've only got one shot
Then you drop out of sight
There isn't one dry run
To whet your appetite
Get it right
--- Unknown ---
We're on the edge of a cliff
Set up to take the ultimate fall
So have a last cigarette
And bet it all
As they're plowing you under
Don't start wondering why
Why not go out with some style
You made it to the last mile
Just pucker up sucker
