------ You're Nothing Without Me ------
--- STINE ---
You are some gumshoe
You just don't think well
Get this, dumb gumshoe,
You come from my inkwell
--- Unknown ---
Is your mouth lonely
With one foot in there
Stone, your brain only
Holds thoughts i put in there
--- Unknown ---
Just what you are i'll spell out
You are a novel pain
One speck of lint that fell out
The last time that i picked my brain
--- STONE ---
You are so jealous
Of my track record
Tolstoy, do tell us
Your feeble hack record
--- Unknown ---
Your weak knees brand you
Soft and unstable
One small threat and you
Fold like a card table
--- Unknown ---
You drool at my adventures
Your broads in bed are bored
Go home and soak your dentures
Your pen is no match for my sword
--- BOTH ---
You're nothing without me
A no-one who'd go undefined
You wouldn't exist
You'd never be missed
--- STINE ---
I tell you you're out of my mind
--- BOTH ---
A show off, a blowhard
You're equal parts hot air and gall
And no one would doubt me
Without me you're nothing at all
--- STINE ---
You're in my plot
I'm still your creator
I call each shot
I'm your private dic-tator
--- STONE ---
You are so thick, you
Eat, breathe, sleep fiction
I'm your meal ticket
Knee-deep in cheap fiction
--- STINE ---
You gloating ignoramus
You haven't any shame
--- STONE ---
Hey, i'm a famous shamus
And most people don't know your name
--- BOTH ---
You're nothing without me
Without me you'd just disappear
Right into thin air
And no one would care
Or notice you were there
--- Unknown ---
A puppet, an upstart
A loser who's destined to fall
I'm everything you always wanted to be
Let's deal with the issue:
You wish you were me
You're nothing without me
Without me you're nothing ...
--- Unknown ---
(To prove his dominance over STONE, STINE resumes typing,
reactivating MUNOZ, who steps back into the light)
--- MUNOZ ---
Let's go!
--- STONE ---
Manny, wait!
--- MUNOZ ---
I said, keep my name out of your mouth!
--- Unknown ---
(MUNOZ punches STONE hard, in the stomach, sending STONE to his knees.
STONE stares at STINE, a character betrayed)
--- STONE ---
You bastard!
--- Unknown ---
(STINE, ignoring him, types four letters)
--- STINE ---
Fade...
Out.
--- STINE ---
You're nothing without me
