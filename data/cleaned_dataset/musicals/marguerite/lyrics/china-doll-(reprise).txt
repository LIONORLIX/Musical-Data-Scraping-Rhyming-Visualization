------ China Doll (Reprise) ------
--- Armand ---
Who will set her free,
In her hour of need?
Poor China Doll,
Have you left it too late?
Some prince may be,
On a valiant white steed,
You'll ride away
To a new life that's waiting.
Spin the wheel of chance,
Is there anyone there to save her?
--- Armand and Marguerite ---
Someone turns the key
And the China Doll must dance.
