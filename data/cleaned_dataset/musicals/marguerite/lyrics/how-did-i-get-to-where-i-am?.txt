------ How Did I Get to Where I Am? ------
--- Marguerite ---
How did I get to where I am?
How could let it get so bad?
Why did I ever let him go,
The one good thing I ever had?
Why did I drift so far from home,
To live my life outside the rules
Among the clowns, among the fools?
--- Unknown ---
I loved the dazzle and the light,
The sweet seductions of the night.
When men of means were everywhere
They used my bed, they slept elsewhere.
I never asked what badge they wore,
They left their passports at the door,
And every man was just one more.
--- Unknown ---
And then at last one came my way
He saw behind the mask I wore
He made the world seem bright and gay
He saw me as a girl once more
How did I get to where I am?
How I come to be alone
And love the only love I've known?
--- Unknown ---
He's gone. The one love I have known.
With each untruth, with each mistake,
I learned that time and youth don't wait,
That China Dolls can fall and break
That sometimes saviours come too late.
--- Unknown ---
The one good thing I ever had.
Why did I ever let him go?
How did I let it get so bad?
