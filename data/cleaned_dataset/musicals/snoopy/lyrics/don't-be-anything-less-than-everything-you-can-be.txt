------ Don't Be Anything Less Than Everything You Can Be ------
--- Unknown ---
Don`t be the leaf if you can be the tree,
Don`t be the raindrop if you can be the sea.
`cause a leaf may fall,
But the tree remains.
It may never rain at all,
But the sea remains;
Better to be the tree and the sea.
See?
--- Unknown ---
Don`t be a cloud if you can be the sky,
Don`t be a feather,
Be a bird and fly.
Clouds roll by,
But the sky rolls on
And a bird can fly
With a feather gone,
--- Unknown ---
Be the bird and the sky
And the tree and the deep blue sea,
Don`t be anything less
Than ev`rything you can be!
--- Unknown ---
Don`t be the sail if you can be the boat.
Don`t be the lining if you can be the coat.
It may lose its sail,
But a boat will float,
And a coat without a lining
Is still a coat.
Better to be the boat and the coat.
Quote!
--- Unknown ---
Don`t be the stick if you can be the drum,
Don`t be the sugar,
Be the plum, by gum.
You can break a stick but the drum will beat.
Without a sugar coat,
Plums`re good to eat.
--- Unknown ---
Better to be the drum
And the plum and the coat
And the bird and the sky and the tree
And the deep blue sea;
Don`t be anything less
Than ev`rything you can be!
--- Unknown ---
Don`t be the `moo` if you can be the cow.
Don`t be the furrow,
If you can be the plow.
`cause you can`t get milk from a `moo`no way,
And the furrow`s in a rut,
But the plow`s okay,
Better to be the cow and the plow!
--- Unknown ---
Now,
--- Unknown ---
Don`t be the sting if you can be the bee,
Don`t be a two if you can be a three
`cause a sting can`t make you a honeybun,
--- Unknown ---
Take two from three and you still got one
--- Unknown ---
Better to be the three and a bee
--- Unknown ---
And a cow and a plow
And a drum and a plum
And a coat, boat, bird, sky, tree
And the deep blue sea.
Don`t be anything less
Than ev`rything you can be!
--- Unknown ---
Don`t be the string if you can be the kite.
Don`t be the darkness,
If you can be the light.
Tho` you lose its string you can fly a kite,
But would anybody here fly a kite at night?
Better to be the kite and the light.
Right!
--- Unknown ---
Don`t be the tail if you can be the dog,
Don`t be the bump if you can be the log.
He can wag his tail,
But it can`t wag `he,`
A bump without a log
Isn`t much to be.
--- Unknown ---
Better to be the dog and the log
And the kite and the light
And the three and a bee
And a cow and a plow
And a drum and a plum
And a coat and a boat
And a bird and the sky and a tree
And the deep blue sea!
Don`t be anything less
Than ev`rything you can be!
