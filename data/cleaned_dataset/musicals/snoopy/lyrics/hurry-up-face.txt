Hurry up face
Make it snappy
Come on, come on
Fall into place
Make me happy
Come on, come on
--- Unknown ---
How long can I wait, face?
I'm feeling the strain
That you're running late, face
Is as plain
As the nose on my face
Can you doubt it?
Come on, come on
--- Unknown ---
Get on my case
Hows about it?
Come on, come on!
Show me your heart
Is in the right place
Come on, come on, come on
Hurry up face!
--- Unknown ---
Won't you please try
Try to hurry?
How time has flown
Years flying by
And I worry
I'll be alone
You're falling behind, face
Don't do this to me
My mirror's not blind, face
It can see
That you're losing the race
By a nose
So get out the lead
--- Unknown ---
Hurry up face
On your toes,
Go full speed ahead
Show me your heart
Is in the right place
--- Unknown ---
One of these days, I'll bet
You're gonna catch up yet
So, on your mark, get set
Hurry up face!
