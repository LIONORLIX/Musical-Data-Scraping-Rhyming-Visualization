------ Where Did That Little Dog Go? ------
--- Unknown ---
When i had my choice
Of a cat or a dog
Why did i op for the ladder
A dog
But it was different then
He was different when he was well small
He even used to come when i would call
Snoopy
Here snoopy
Snoopy
Snoopy
Where did that little dog go?
Only a moment ago
He was there jumping my arms
Eating from my hand
I don't understand
Where did that little dog go?
He's not the puppy i know
Soft and warm
Tugging at my sleeve
Begging me to play
Was it yesterday
He was snoopy little snoopy
So dependent on me for so much of his laughter
Why can't before be just like after
What was your hurry to grow
Grow up and worry me so
It's not fair
Snoopy don't you see growing up to be
Someone who doesn't need me
