------ I Think I Got You Beat ------
--- FIONA ---
I had nothing in that tower
Fighting boredom by the hour.
Princess lonely
Walking circles
I had only...
--- Unknown ---
Bare essentials
army cot
a hot plate and chamber pot.
And every morning I would boil it.
No choice I had no toilet.
Just a view of devastation
out one window, isolation
in my bedroom
and very little headroom
Twenty years I sat and waited
I'm very dedicated
On the walls the days were added
Luckily those walls were padded
so...
--- Unknown ---
I think I got you beat
I think I got you beat
yeah, yeah yeeeaaahh,
I think I got you beat
I think I got you beat.
--- SHREK ---
(spoken)Oh you think so. That was a sad story but
I've heard better I'm just saying
A for effort thanks for playing
Sad to see a princess suffer
But I had it rougher
Like that time a mob with torchers burned my britches
See the scorches
You're just whiney
I had a flaming hiney
As I fled I had to wonder
If I were torn asunder
Would an ogre go to Heaven
Did I mention I was seven?
So...
I think I got you beat. yeah, yeah, yeah
I think I got you beat.
I think I got you beat.

No warm regards
--- SHREK ---
No Christmas cards
--- FIONA ---
And every day
--- SHREK ---
Was hell on earth day.
--- FIONA ---
(spoken)Okay top this.
I missed my prom
--- SHREK ---
My dad and mom sent me away,
it was my birthday.
--- FIONA ---
(spoken)I was sent away on Christmas Eve. Haha.
--- FIONA/SHREK ---
My dad and mom sent me away...
--- FIONA ---
So...
--- SHREK ---
So...
--- FIONA/SHREK ---
I think I got you beat, yeah, yeah, yeah
I think I got you beat, yeah, yeah, yeah
