------ This Is How Dreams Come True ------
--- Fiona ---
This is how a dream comes true.
This is how i pictured him.
Climbing in to rescue me.
This was always mean to be.
--- Unknown ---
This is how a scene must go.
Standing there the light just so.
Then you smile and gaze at me.
Take my hand on bended knee.
Bended knee.
Bended knee!
--- Unknown ---
So even though we only met.
Somehow i always knew,
It would look like this
When dreams come true.

Shrek!
--- fiona ---
Hey, what are you doing?
--- shrek ---
I have to save my ass.
--- fions ---
Easy im in heels!
--- Unknown ---
I've longed for this my whole life long.
And now your doing it all wrong!
Got a rope a steed awaits.
Thats what every story sates.
Riding over ruff terrain.
Pass the dragon you have slayed.
You have slayed
You have slayed
--- shrek ---
Its on my to do list.
--- fiona ---
This is how i pictured it.
More or less i must admit.
Fulttering in my heart.
A life about to start.
I knew this day would come,
And you would find your way,
At last my dream comes true.
I knew, i knew, i knew,
