------ The Ballad of Farquaad ------
--- Unknown ---
Farquaad
My father simply couldn't accept that i wanted nothing to do with the family business...that lowly,
Dirty family business...
--- Unknown ---
(sung)
My daddy was a miner
So he wasn't much around
Foraging for diamonds
A life spent underground
--- Unknown ---
Daddy didn't talk much
He barely said hello
He'd simply mutter heigh ho
And off to work he'd go
--- Unknown ---
Daddy was grumpy...
--- Unknown ---
My momma was a princess
Who left her crown behind
Daddy was her true love, so
Momma didn't mind
--- Unknown ---
I never knew my momma
But she could've been a queen
She married way beneath her...
Beneath her knee, i mean
--- Unknown ---
Ohhh, daddy's bed was lumpy
So mommy couldn't sleep
Daddy built a new one
So tall and so steep
--- Unknown ---
Twenty-five mattresses she slept upon
One night she rolled over...
And momma was gone
--- Unknown ---
So daddy was grumpy...
--- Unknown ---
Me and my old man
A tale as old as dirt
A bitter distant father
In a tiny undershirt
--- Unknown ---
Daddy up and left me
Left me good as dead
Now he lives in squalor
Sleeping seven to a bed
--- Unknown ---
(spoken)
You abandoned me in those woods, daddy.
Well i crawled out! And up! Oh, if only you could see me now, daddy...
I'd invite you to the wedding but you have to be
This tall to get in! Hahahahahaha!
--- Unknown ---
(sung)
My bride-to-be is gorgeous
Her wedding dress, designer
The guest list will be major
Without a minor miner
--- Unknown ---
Guards
La la la la la la la la la la la la la
--- Unknown ---
Farquaad
Packs of royal lackeys
Playing violin
--- Unknown ---
Guards
Strings of royal underlings

Farquaad & (guards)
Who will not let you in!
Ha ha, ha ha, ha ha!
Tricked out carriage!
Twenty stallions!
With a coachman named raoul
Big reception!
With a boy band!
And a royal deejay by the pool...
--- Unknown ---
Yes! I can see my future
And so it shall be done
It's total domination
With some torture just for fun, hee hee!
--- Unknown ---
'Cause i will have my wedding and i will have a queen!
And once i get that crown on
You will get the guillotine
--- Unknown ---
And i'll punish you daddy
'Cause i'm all grown up and bigger than you'll ever know!
--- Unknown ---
You're gonna pay daddy!
It's any day daddy!
I'm off to work
