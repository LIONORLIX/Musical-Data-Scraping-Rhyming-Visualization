Donkey

Shrek
Donkey please no. I am begging you-

Donkey
Sing a song
Yes a travel song
When you gotta go somewhere
'Cause the fun is getting there.
Yeah. Oh what the heck, i must confess
I love a road trip!
--- Unknown ---
Sing a song.
Hit the trail.
Forget the maps. Forget the guides.
Before ya know it, you've made strides with me.
--- Unknown ---
And i know - all i need - all along
Is a path - and a pal - and a song,
So i'm singin',
And i'm pallin' with you,
See? It makes the time go by faster!
