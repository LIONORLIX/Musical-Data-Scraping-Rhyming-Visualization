------ Make a Move ------
--- Donkey ---
There’s something going on around here
I’ve been watching and the signals are clear
A nervous laugh when she brushes his skin
The sweaty palms, the big dopey grin
Hmmm hmmm hmmm
With a giggle and a flip of her hair
I smell the pheromones in the air
Making goo goo eyes over their food
They need my help here in setting the mood
(oh you don’t believe love is blind’
Well i got some friends who think otherwise. And here they are. Direct from my imagination)
[three blind mice]
Three blind mice
[donkey]
Watch your step girls
[three blind mice]
Three blind mice
See how they run
[donkey]
You got to turn up the heat
You got to butter the pan
[donkey with mice]
You got to make a move and don’t be afraid
[donkey]
Reach for her hand
And maybe give her a kiss
[donkey with mice]
She’s waiting for a move to be made

With a sunset and a beautiful girl
