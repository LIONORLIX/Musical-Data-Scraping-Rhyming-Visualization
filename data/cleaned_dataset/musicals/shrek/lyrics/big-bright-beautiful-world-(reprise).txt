------ Big Bright Beautiful World (Reprise) ------
--- Shrek ---
--- Unknown ---
It's a big bright beautiful world
with happiness all around.
It's peaches and cream
if a dream comes true.
--- Unknown ---
It's a big bright beautiful world
with possibilities everywhere.
If true love is blind
maybe you won't mind the view?
--- Unknown ---
I know I'm not the handsome prince
for whom you waited
I don't have a fancy castle,
and I'm not sophisticated.
A princess and an ogre,
I admit, is complicated.
You've never read a book like this,
but fairytales should really be updated.
--- Unknown ---
It's a big bright beautiful world.
I see it now, I'll let it in.
I'll tear down a wall
and clear a spot for two
