Alright, when I call your name step forward. Pinocchio, the puppet.

That's your patch of mud down there.
--- Pinocchio ---
Oh, dopped on a swamp. Man, I tell you sometimes being a fairytale creature sucks pine sap.
--- Pinocchio ---
Life is disappointing,
Whoa is what I know.
Outted by my nose,
That's just how it goes,
For poor Pinocchio.
Story of my life,
Always doomed to fail.
Cheated by a fox,
Swallowed by a whale.
That's the story of my life, oh yeah,
That's the story of my life.
