A picture perfect bride

In a fairytale the knott must get tied

Finally it's real
I knew what i might look like
But i never thought how i might feel

What you so often see isn't always so
There's more

Every princess is a beauty
Every dragon must be cruel
Big goes with bad
And royal goes with beauty
We play our parts
We follow every rule

But i never knew they meant in the heart

Isn't always so
There's more
