Princess…
How’s it going first of all?
Good’
Uh, it’s good for me too.
I’m okay
--- Unknown ---
I picked this flower
Right over there
Is where it grew
And I don’t really like it
But it made me think of you
Because it’s pretty
Is what I’m trying to say
And you are also pretty
But I like you anyway
--- Unknown ---
So please accept this flower
With its petals and a stem
Which represent my feelings
And tells you how..
Oh man I’m in trouble
--- Unknown ---
When words fail
What will I do’
When words fail
How will she know how I feel?
When words fail
Will I fail too’
--- Unknown ---
Hello fair princess
Oh look the moon
Is out tonight
You remind me of that moon
Because it’s big and bright
And by big I don’t mean chubby
Obviously you’re not fat
But your personality is biggish
Is what I meant by that
--- Unknown ---
Sorry ‘bout that fat thing,
I’m on the hefty side myself
I have to blame the gene pool
Which reminds me of’
Oh where I am going with this
--- Unknown ---
When words fail
What will I do’
When words fail
How will she know how I feel?
When words fail
Will I fail too’
--- Unknown ---
Do I have a snowball’s chance?
Are my prospects just too grim?
I spent my life stuck in the mud
Now I’m crawling out on a limb
--- Unknown ---
If words fail
She’ll know what I mean
If words fail
She’ll just take my hand
She sees me like no one else has
If words fail
She’ll understand
