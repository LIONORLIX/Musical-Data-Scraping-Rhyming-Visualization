------ I'm a Believer ------
--- Unknown ---
I thought love was only true in fairy tales
Meant for someone else but not for me.
Love was out to get me (dum dum dum dum dum)
That's the way it seems (dum dum dum dum dum)
Disappointment haunted all my dreams.
--- Unknown ---
And then I saw her face
Now I'm a believer.
Not a trace
Of doubt in my mind.
I'm in love
I'm a believer, I couldn't leave her
if I tried
--- Unknown ---
I thought love was more or less a given thing
It seems the more I gave the less I got, Oh Yeah
What's the use in trying
All you get is pain
When I needed sunshine I got rain
--- Unknown ---
And then I saw her face,
Now i'm a believer.
Not a trace
Of doubt in my mind.
I'm in love
I'm a believer, I couldn't leave her
if I tried
