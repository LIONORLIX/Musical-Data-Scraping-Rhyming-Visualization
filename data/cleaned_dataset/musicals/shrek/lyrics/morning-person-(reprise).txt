------ Morning Person (Reprise) ------
--- Fiona ---
Good morning dawn
Good morning day
Good morning Morning Dove
I had a long and sleepless night
Pondering true love
My fairy tale
I know so well
Must somehow gone awry
Looks may be deceiving but,
Feelings cannot lie.
Do I love him?
Last night I was uncertain
But this morning
This morning
This morning
(Spoken) Shrek, thank goodness. There is something I have to tell you.
[Shrek]
You don?t have to tell me anything I heard enough last night
[Fiona]
Oh, you heard what I said?
[Shrek]
Every word! Especially, ?Who could love such a hideous ugly beast??
