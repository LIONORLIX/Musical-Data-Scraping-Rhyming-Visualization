------ Before and After You ------
--- FRANCESCA ---
Holding you close against my skin,
And pulling you inside me,
Suddenly there's a world I never know.
Kissing you now, the waves begin
And evermore divide me:
Before and after you.
--- Unknown ---
You, with a touch, at once erased
The lines and walls around me.
How did you know exactly what to do?
Feeling your fingers on my waist,
I know my fate has found me:
Before and after you.
--- ROBERT ---
I love you, Francesca.
--- FRANCESCA ---
