------ It All Fades Away ------
--- ROBERT ---
There was something in a desert.
There was some place wild and green,
And a child in a village I passed through.
There are places that I've traveled,
And so many things I've seen,
And it all fades away but you.
--- Unknown ---
I was sliding down a mountain,
I was burning in the sun,
I was crying with amazement at the view.
I was capturing a moment,
But when all is said and done,
Well, it all fades away but you.
It all fades away, it all fades away,
It all fades but you.
--- Unknown ---
I have sailed across the oceans,
Past the cities and the farms,
On a neverending quest for something new,
And the only things that mattered
Were the four days in your arms,
'Cause, it all fades away but you.
It all fades away, it all fades away,
It all fades away but you.
--- Unknown ---
There is one thing that's eternal,
That cannot be torn apart,
There is one thing that remains forever true.
Past the thinking, past the breathing,
Past the beating of my heart,
It will all fade away but you.
It all fades away, it all fades away,
It all fades away but you.
It all fades away, it all fades away,
It all fades away but you.
But you.
But you.
