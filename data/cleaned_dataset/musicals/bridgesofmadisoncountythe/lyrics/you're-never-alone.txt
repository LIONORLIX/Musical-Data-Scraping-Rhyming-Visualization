Bud
Went down to the hansen place to check on bob and the kid.
One look at that fella’s face, i guess i knew what he did.
Too proud to admit he’s stuck when all his crops went down.
Lord knows we’d’ve backed him up to get a loan in town.
--- Unknown ---
Damn fool, when the bills came through,
He couldn’t think of anything else to do ‘
Thought he was gonna lose the farm.
Waits ‘til cora goes to town,
Turns the thresher on and then lays right down,
So the hospital took off half his arm.
--- Unknown ---
I know it ain’t easy,
This is a long road.
Nothin’ Is easy out there on your own,
But if you’re ready to stand up,
I tell ya, by god’s grace,
We’re all from the same place,
Right down to the bone:
You’re never alone.
