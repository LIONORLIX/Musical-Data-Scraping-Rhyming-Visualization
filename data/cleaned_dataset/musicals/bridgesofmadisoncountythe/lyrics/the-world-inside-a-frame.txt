------ The World Inside a Frame ------
--- ROBERT ---
It starts with the light.
It’s like you wouldn’t even know which way to look
Until the sun showed you a line,
Showed you a corner,
Built you a frame.
And once there’s a frame,
Then you can see.
--- Unknown ---
See’
--- Unknown ---
Now: see’
--- Unknown ---
See the world!
Here’s the world through a small, small window.
You thought it was a bridge,
You thought it was the water,
You thought it was the sky...
It’s the world, inside a frame.
--- Unknown ---
And you wait.
And you wait.
And you wait.
And you...
Right there, something shifted! Something...
That tree threw a shadow! Did you’’
--- Unknown ---
There! There! There!
It’s like all you didn’t know that you were waiting for
Is just outside the frame,
And it can change
The way you see’
--- Unknown ---
See the world!
Here’s the world in a box forever.
--- Unknown ---
Go stand over there.
--- Unknown ---
Don’t look at me.
Now:
Look at me.
Look at me. There. There. There. There. There.
--- Unknown ---
There’s the world.
There’s the world in your face, Francesca.
