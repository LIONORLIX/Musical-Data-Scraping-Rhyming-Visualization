What do you call a man like that?
How do you even try to give it a name,

From what time or place or fairy-tale
Comes someone so ridiculous,
So earnest,
So strong?

What do you call a man like this?
How to describe his hands,
So tense and so easy,
So controlled but unpredictable-
The tornado of his eyes
Shining bright,
Finding light?
Wanting something,
Knowing something,
Seeing something,
Something holy-
Something newly born
