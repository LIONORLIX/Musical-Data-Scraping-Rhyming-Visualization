------ Another Life ------

Put inside the picture frame some tables and a coffeepot,
A uniform, a girl of twenty-three.
Sitting at a table, put a man of thirty-seven,
As exotic as that girl would ever see.
Have her standing over him and laughing
As he?s asking her a question no one thought to ask before.
Color him with mystery and color her with danger
And expose them just enough to wish for more.
--- Unknown ---
And there was something there between us.
Something I could never name:
Something stronger, something stranger,
More than quicksand, more than flame:
Another life.

Further down the gallery, a picture of a couple
On a honeymoon in Marrakesh somewhere.
See him with his camera at his eye,
And see her grasping at his hand,
Afraid he doesn?t know she?s there.
--- Unknown ---
And there was something deep inside him,
Something I could never reach.
Like he saw it getting closer,
In a window, on a beach:
Another life.
--- Unknown ---
Another life...
But I believed I?d grow to be
The thing he needed most to see,
And if our nights just stayed this hot,
I?d break him down,
He?d open up...
Well, obviously not.

In the kitchen, FRANCESCA drops something and as they both bend down to pick it up, they come close to bumping heads, or touching. They laugh, though we only see it in dim light. They seem to move toward each other. But FRANCESCA pulls away from this closeness. We see that.

Back there in a shadow, find a picture of a woman
Wearing four years of confusion like a scar.
Walking through the door and leaving nothing but a note
That says ?I?m sorry, Robert,? taped to her guitar.
--- Unknown ---
And there is so much I still wonder,
Did he need me? Did he know?
?Love is open, love is easy?:
That was someone long ago.
Another life.
