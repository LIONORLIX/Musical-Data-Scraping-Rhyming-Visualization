------ New Wondering ------
--- ROBERT ---
A little twinge,
A little shock,
A little whisper at the bottom of your memory.
A sudden wind,
A gentle knock,
And then a rustle in the leaves.
You hold your breath,
You check the lock,
You reassure yourself that nothing’s at the window.
--- Unknown ---
But you’re wondering.
You’re wondering.
You’re wondering what that was.
Nothing’s gonna happen.
--- Unknown ---
You turn a key,
You flip a switch,
You settle back into the blissful unfamiliar.
You close your eyes,
But there’s an itch,
A little hurt your heart retrieves.
But you ignore
The tiny twitch,
Pretend the feeling will be gone before the morning.
--- Unknown ---
But you’re wondering.
You’re wondering.
You’re wondering where you are.
Nothing’s gonna happen.
--- Unknown ---
Nothing’s gonna happen.
--- Unknown ---
But wouldn’t it be fine to share
The weather in her eyes, her hair,
Her footsteps as she climbs the stair,
The shadow in her light’
--- Unknown ---
But everything you know is true
And everything you want to do
And everything that makes you you
Collides against the night.
And nothing’s black and white.
--- Unknown ---
And you’re wondering.
You’re wondering.
You’re wondering what to do.
You’re wondering.
You’re wondering.
--- Unknown ---
You’re wondering if it’s true.
Nothing’s gonna happen.
Nothing has to happen.
