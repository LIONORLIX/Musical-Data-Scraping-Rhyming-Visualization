------ That's When the Tears Start ------
--- Unknown ---
I hold my head high
each time you walk by
give you a great big smile
although I want to die
--- Unknown ---
But when you're not in view
My whole heart breaks in two
that's when the tears start
and I start crying (over you)
that's when the tears start
and I start crying (over you)
that's when the tears start
inside I'm dying
--- Unknown ---
When friends are near me
I start pretending
Tell him I'm doing fine
My heart is mending
--- Unknown ---
But when they're not around
my whole world tumbles down and
that's when the tears start
and I start crying (over you)
that's when the tears start
and I start crying (over you)
that's when the tears start
inside I'm dying
--- Unknown ---
Don't think about you
So much in daylight
'cause work is on my mind
And I make it all right
--- Unknown ---
But when the shadows fall
Memories come to call
that's when the tears start
and I start crying (over you)
that's when the tears start
