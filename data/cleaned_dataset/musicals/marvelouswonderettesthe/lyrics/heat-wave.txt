------ Heat Wave ------
--- Unknown ---
Whenever I'm with you
Something inside starts burning
and my heart's filled with fire
--- Unknown ---
Stop this - it's got a hold on me
I said this ain't the way it's supposed to be
--- Unknown ---
It's like a heatwave burning in my heart
I can't keep from crying
Tearing me apart
--- Unknown ---
Whenever he calls my name
Sounds so soft sweet and plain
Right then, right there
I feel this burning pain
This high blood pressure's got a hold on me
I said this ain't the way love's supposed to be
--- Unknown ---
It's like a heatwave burning in my heart
I can't keep from crying
Tearing me apart
--- Unknown ---
Whenever I'm with you
Something inside starts burning
And my hearts filled with fire
--- Unknown ---
Something's got me amazed
Don't know what to do
My head's in a haze
--- Unknown ---
It's like a heatwave burning in my heart
I can't keep from crying
