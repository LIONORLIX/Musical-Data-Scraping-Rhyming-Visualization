Maybe, if I pray every night
You'll come back to me
And maybe, if I cry everyday
You'll come back to-ooo stay
Ooh, ooh, maybe

Maybe, if I held your hand
You will understand
And maybe, if I'd kiss your lips
I'd be at your command
Ooh, ooh, maybe
--- Unknown ---
I prayed and prayed
To the Lord
To send you back, my love
But instead you came to me
Only in my-i-i-i dreams
--- Unknown ---
Maybe, if I pray every night
You'll come back to me
And maybe, if I cry everyday
You'll come back to-ooo stay
Ooh, ooh, maybe
