Goodnight, sweetheart, well it's time to go,
Goodnight, sweetheart, well it's time to go,
I hate to leave you, but I really must say,
Goodnight, sweetheart, goodnight.

Well, it's three o'clock in the morning,
Baby, I just can't treat you right,
Well, I hate to leave you, babe,
Don't mean maybe, because I love you so.

Now, my mother and my father,
Might hear if I stay here too long,
One kiss and we'll part,
And I'll be going,
