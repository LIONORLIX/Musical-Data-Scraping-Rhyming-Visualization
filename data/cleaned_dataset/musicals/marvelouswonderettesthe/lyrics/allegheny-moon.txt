Allegheny Moon, I need your light
To help me find romance tonight,
So shine... shine... shine (on tonight)

Allegheny Moon, your silver beams
Can lead the way to golden dreams,
So shine... shine... please shine (shine)

High among the stars, so bright above,
The magic of your lamp of love
Can make him mine
--- Unknown ---
Allegheny Moon, it's up to you
Please see what you can do
For me -- and for my one and only love (Allegheny Moon)
