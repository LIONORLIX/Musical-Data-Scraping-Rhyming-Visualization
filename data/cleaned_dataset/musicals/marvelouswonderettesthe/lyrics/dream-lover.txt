------ Dream Lover ------
--- Unknown ---
Every night I hope and pray
A dream lover will come my way
A girl to hold in my arms
And know the magic of her charms
'cause I want (yeah-yeah yeah)
A girl (yeah-yeah yeah)
To call (yeah-yeah yeah)
My own (yeah-yeah)
I want a dream lover so I don't have to dream alone
--- Unknown ---
Dream lover, where are you
With a love, oh, so true?
And a hand that I can hold,
To feel you near as I grow old?
'cause I want (yeah-yeah yeah)
A girl (yeah-yeah yeah)
To call (yeah-yeah yeah)
My own (yeah-yeah)
I want a dream lover so I don't have to dream alone
--- Unknown ---
Someday, I don't know how,
I hope she'll hear my plea
Some way, I don't know how,
She'll bring her love to me

Dream lover, until then,
I'll go to sleep and dream again
That's the only thing to do,
Till all my lover's dreams come true
'Cause I want (yeah-yeah yeah)
A girl (yeah-yeah yeah)
To call (yeah-yeah yeah)
My own (yeah-yeah)
I want a dream lover so I don't have to dream alone
