Thank you for showing
Me a wonderful time
Gee, everything just
Turned out so fine
--- Unknown ---
So thank you and goodnight
Thank you and goodnight
Thank you and goodnight

Funny, the hours seemed
To go by so fast
I hope that this time
Won't be the last
I want to see you again
--- Unknown ---
I never felt this way before
After a very first date
I never knew what
One kiss could do
Gee, but the feeling is great
--- Unknown ---
Baby, it's getting late
And I've gotta go
Here's something that
You ought to know
I've had the time of my life
--- Unknown ---
Thank you and good night
Thank you and goodnight
Thank you and goodnight...

Thank you, baby
I had a wonderful time
