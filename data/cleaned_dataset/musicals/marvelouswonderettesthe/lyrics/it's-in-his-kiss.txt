Oh, oh, oh, hug him!
Squeeze him tight!
Find out what you wanna know!
If it's love, if it really is,
It's there in his kiss!
--- Unknown ---
(How 'bout the way he acts?)
Oh no! That's not the way!
You're not listenin' to all I'm sayin'!
If you wanna know
If he loves you so
It's in his kiss!
Oh, ooh, oh! Its in his kiss!
