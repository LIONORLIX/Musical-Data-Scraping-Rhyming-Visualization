------ Secret Love ------
--- Unknown ---
Once I had a secret love
That lived within the heart of me
All too soon my secret love
Became impatient to be free
--- Unknown ---
So I told the friendly star
The way that dreamers often do
Just how wonderful you are
And why I'm so in love with you
--- Unknown ---
Now I should it from the highest hills
Even told the golden daffodils
At last my heart's an open door
And my secret love's no secret anymore
