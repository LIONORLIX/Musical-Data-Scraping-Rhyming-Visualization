------ Sugartime ------

Sugar in the morning
Sugar in the evening
Sugar at suppertime
Be my little sugar
And love me all the time
--- Unknown ---
Honey in the morning
Honey in the evening
Honey at suppertime
So by my little honey
And love me all the time
--- Unknown ---
Put your arms around me
And swear by stars above
You'll be mine forever
In a heaven of love

Sugar in the morning
Sugar in the evening
Sugar at suppertime
Be my little sugar
And love me all the time
--- Unknown ---
Now Sugartime
Is anytime
That you're near
'Cause you're so dear
So don't you roam
Just be my honeycomb
And live in a heaven of love.

And love me all the time

Be my little sugar
And love me (love me)
all (all), all the time
