Stupid Cupid
You're a real mean guy
I'd like to clip your wings
So you can't fly
I am in love and it's a crying shame
And I know that you're the one to blame
--- Unknown ---
Hey hey
Set me free
Stupid Cupid
Stop picking on me
--- Unknown ---
I can't do my homework
And I can't think straight
I meet him every morning
At 'bout half-past eight
I'm acting like a lovesick fool
You've even got me carrying his books to school
--- Unknown ---
Hey hey
Set me free
Stupid Cupid
Stop picking on me
--- Unknown ---
You mixed me up for good
Right from the very start
Hey, go play Robin Hood
With somebody else's heart
--- Unknown ---
You got me jumping like a crazy clown
And I don't feature what your puttin' down
Well since I kissed his loving lips of wine
The thing that bothers me is
That I like it fine
