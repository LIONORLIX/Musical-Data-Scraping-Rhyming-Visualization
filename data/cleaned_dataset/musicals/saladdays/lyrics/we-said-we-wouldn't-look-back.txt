------ We Said We Wouldn't Look Back ------
--- Jane ---
We'll never be able to break the spell
--- Timothy ---
The magic will hold us still.
--- Jane ---
Sometimes we may pretend to forget
--- Timothy ---
But of course we never will.
Three perfect years -
--- Jane ---
Perhaps there'll more?
Life's only beginning you know
--- Timothy ---
Oh yes it's not that I want to stay.
It's just that I don't want to go.
--- Jane ---
We mustn't look back,
--- Timothy ---
No we mustn't look back.
--- Both ---
Whatever our memories are.
We? mustn't say these were our happiest days,
but our happiest days so far.
--- Jane ---
If I start? looking behind me and begin retracing my track,
I'll remind you to remind me we said we wouldn't back.
--- Timothy ---
And if you should happen to find me with an outlook dreary and black.
I'll remind you to remind me we said we wouldn't look back.
--- Both ---
It's hard to forget the plays,
the balls
the walks by the river in Spring,
the Dons we placated,
the lectures we missed,
but soon they won't mean a thing.
So if I let nostalgia blind me and me resolution is slack
I'll remind you to remind me we said we wouldn't look back
--- Timothy ---
They're certain to miss us when we're gone,
they're not worth much if they don't.
--- Jane ---
And they'll beg us to visit them time after time -
oh dear, maybe they won't!
--- Timothy ---
But if I once stop looking behind me,
and begin retracing my track,
I'll remind you to remind me
--- Both ---
We said we wouldn't look back.
We've broken the ties,
we've said the goodbyes,
there's? no more for us to pack.
Don't turn round -
we're outward bound -
