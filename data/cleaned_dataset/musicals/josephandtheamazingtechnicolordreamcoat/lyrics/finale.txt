I closed my eyes, drew back the curtain
To see for certain what I thought I knew
Far far away, someone was weeping
But the world was sleeping
Any dream will do
Joseph & Children
--- Unknown ---
I wore my coat, with golden lining
Bright colours shining, wonderful and new
And in the east, the dawn was breaking
And the world was waking
Any dream will do
Joseph
--- Unknown ---
A crash of drums
Narrator
--- Unknown ---
A flash of light
Joseph
--- Unknown ---
My golden coat flew out of sight
Joseph & Narrator
--- Unknown ---
The colours faded into darkness
I was left alone
Joseph & Narrator & Children
--- Unknown ---
May I return to the beginning
The light is dimming, and the dream is too
The world and I, we are still waiting
Still hesitating, any dream will do
Still hesitating, any dream will do
Full Company
--- Unknown ---
May I return to the beginning
The light is dimming, and the dream is too
The world and I, we are still waiting
Still hesitating, any dream will do
Give me my coloured coat,
My amazing coloured coat
Give me my coloured coat,
My amazing coloured
