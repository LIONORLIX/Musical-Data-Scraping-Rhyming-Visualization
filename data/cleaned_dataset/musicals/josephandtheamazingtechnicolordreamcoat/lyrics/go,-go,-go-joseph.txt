Joseph's luck was really out,
His spirit and his fortune low
Alone he sat, alone he thought
Of happy times he used to know
First Man
--- Unknown ---
Hey dreamer, don't be so upset
Second Man
--- Unknown ---
Hey Joseph, you're not beaten yet
Narrator & Ensemble
--- Unknown ---
Go, go, go Joseph you know what they say
Hang on now Joseph you'll make it some day
Don't give up Joseph fight till you drop
We've read the book and you come at on top
Narrator
--- Unknown ---
Now into Joseph's prison cell
Were flung two very frightened men
Baker & Buttler
--- Unknown ---
We don't think we will ever
See the light of day again
Hey Joseph, help us if you can
We've had dreams that we don't understand
Narrator & Ensemble
--- Unknown ---
Both men were servants of Pharaoh the King
Both in the doghouse for doing their thing
Narrator
--- Unknown ---
One was a baker, a cook in his prime
One was a buttler, the Jeeves of his time
Joseph
--- Unknown ---
Tell me of your dreams my friends
And I will tell you what they show
Though I cannot guarantee
To get it right, I'll have a go
Narrator
--- Unknown ---
First the butler, trembling took the floor
Nervously he spoke of what he saw
Buttler
--- Unknown ---
There I was standing in front of a vine
I took some grapes and I crushed them to wine
I gave some to Pharaoh who drank from my cup
I tried to interpret but I had to give up
Joseph
--- Unknown ---
You will soon be free my friend
So do not worry any more
The king will let you out of here,
You'll buttle as you did before
Narrator
--- Unknown ---
Next the baker rose to tell his dream
Hoping it would have a similar theme
Baker
--- Unknown ---
There I was standing with baskets of breads
High in the sky I saw birds overhead
Who flew to my baskets and ate every slice
Give me the message - like his would be nice
Joseph
--- Unknown ---
Sad to say your dream is not
The kind of dream I'd like to get
Pharaoh has it in for you,
Your execution date is set
Don't rely on all I said I saw
It's just that I have not been wrong before
