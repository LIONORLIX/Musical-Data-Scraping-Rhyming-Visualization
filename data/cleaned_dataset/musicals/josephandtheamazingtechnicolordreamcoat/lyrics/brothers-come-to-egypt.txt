So back in Canaan the future looked rough
Jacob's family were finding it tough
Brothers
--- Unknown ---
For the famine has caught us unprepared
We are thin
We are ill
We are getting scared
It's enough to make anyone weep
We are down to our very last sheep
Reuben
--- Unknown ---
We will starve if we hang around here
Zebulun
--- Unknown ---
But in Egypt there's food going spare
Asher
--- Unknown ---
They've got corn
They've got meat
They've got fruit and drinks
Dan
--- Unknown ---
And if we have the time
We could see the Sphinx
Narrator
--- Unknown ---
So they finally decided to go
Off to Egypt to see brother Jo
So they all lay before
Joseph's feet
--- Unknown ---
Brothers
--- Unknown ---
Mighty prince, give us something to eat
Narrator
--- Unknown ---
Joseph found it a strain
Not to laugh because
Not a brother among them
Knew who he was
Joseph
--- Unknown ---
I shall now take them all for a ride
