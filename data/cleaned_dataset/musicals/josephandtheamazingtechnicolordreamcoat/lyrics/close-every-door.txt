------ Close Every Door ------
--- Unknown ---
Joseph
--- Unknown ---
Close every door to me,
Hide all the world from me
Bar all the windows
And shut out the light
Do what you want with me,
Hate me and laugh at me
Darken my daytime
And toture my night
If my life were important I
Would ask will I live or die
But I know the answers lie
Far from this world
Close every door to me,
Keep those I love from me
Children of Israel
Are never alone
For I know I shall find
My own peace of mind
For I have been promised
A land of my own
--- Unknown ---
Children
--- Unknown ---
Close every door to me,
Hide all the world from me
Bar all the windows
And shut out the light
Joseph
--- Unknown ---
Just give me a number
Instead of my name
Forget all about me
And let me decay
I do not matter,
I'm only one person
Destroy me completely
Then throw me away
If my life were important I
Would ask will I live or die
But I know the answers lie
Far from this world
--- Unknown ---
Joseph, Ensemble & Children
--- Unknown ---
Close every door to me,
Keep those I love from me
Children of Israel
Are never alone
For we know we shall find
Our own peace of mind
For we have been promised
