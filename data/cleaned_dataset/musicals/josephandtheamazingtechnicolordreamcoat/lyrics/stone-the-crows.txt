Pharaoh said -
Pharaoh

Well stone the crows,
This Joseph is a clever kid
Who'd have thought that fourteen cows
Could mean the things he said they did?
Joseph, you must help me further;
I have got a job for you
You shall lead us through this crisis -
You shall be my number two

Pharaoh told his guards to fetch
A chisel from the local store
Whereupon he ordered them
To cut the chains that Joseph wore
Joseph got a royal pardon
And a host of splendid things
A chariot of gold, a cloak,
A medal and some signet rings

Seven summers on the trot
Were perfect just as Joseph said
Joseph saw that food was gathered
Ready for the years ahead
Seven years of famine followed
Egypt didn't mind a bit
The first recorded rationing
In history was a hit

Joseph how can we ever say
All that we want to about you
We're so glad that you came our way
We would have perished without you
Pharaoh
--- Unknown ---
Joseph we are the perfect team
Old buddies, that's you and me
I was wise to have chosen you
You'll be wise to agree

All that we want to about you
We're so glad that you came our way
We would have perished without you
Pharaoh

We were in a jam
Would have baffled Abraham
But now we're a partneship
It's just a piece of cake

Greatest man since Noah
Only goes to shoah
Joseph

Anyone from anywhere can make it
If they get a lucky break

This could be a happy ending,
Perfect place to stop the show
Joseph after all has gone
About as far as he can go
But I'm sure that Jacob and
His other sons have crossed your mind
How had famine hit the family
