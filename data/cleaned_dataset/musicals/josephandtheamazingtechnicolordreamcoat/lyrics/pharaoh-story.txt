------ Pharaoh Story ------

Narrator

Pharaoh, he was
A powerful man
With the ancient world
In the palm of his hand
To all intents and purposes he
Was Egypt with a capital E
Whatever he did
He was showered with praise
If he cracked a joke
Then you chortled for days
No-one had rights or a
Vote but the king
In fact you might say
He was fairly right-wing
When Pharaoh's around,
Then you get down on the ground
If you ever find yourself near Ramases
Get down on your knees

Down at the other
End of the scale
Joseph is still
Doing time in jail
For even though he is
In with the guards
A liftime in prison
Seems quite on the cards
But if my analysis of
The position is right
At the end of the tunnel
There's seems a glimmer of light
For all of a sudden
Indescribable things
Have shattered the sleep
Of both peasants and kings
Strange as it seems,
There's been a run of crazy dreams
And a man who can interpret
Could go far - could become a star
