And azure and lemon and russet and grey
And purple and white and pink and orange
And blue

There's one more angel in heaven
There's one more star in the sky
Joseph we'll never forget you
It's tough but we're gonna get by
There's one more angel in heaven
There's one more star in the sky
Joseph the things that you stood for
Like truth and light never die

A Pharaoh's story

Strange as it seems
There's been a run of crazy dreams
And a man who can interpret
Could go far
Could become a star
Could be famous
Could be a big success
Could be famous
Could be a big success
Could be famous
Could be a big success
Could be famous
Could be a big success
Joseph,
Pharaoh's number two
Joseph,
Egypt looks to you
Joseph,
Pharaoh's number two
Joseph,
Egypt looks to you
Joseph!
Well I was wandering
along by the banks of the river
When seven fat cows
came up out of the Nile,
uh-huh oh yeah!
And right behind these
fine healthy animals came
Seven other cows,
skinny and vile, uh-huh oh yeah!
Well the thin cows ate
the fat cows which I
Thought would do them
good, uh-huh oh yeah!
But it didn't make
them fatter like such
A monster supper should
Well the thin cows were as thin
As they had ever, ever, ever been
This dream has got me baffled
Hey, Joseph, what does it mean?
Well you know that kings ain't stupid
But I don't have a clue
So don't be cruel Joseph
Help now me I beg of you

So back in Canaan
the future looked rough
Jacob's family were finding it tough
For the famine has
caught us unprepared
We are thin
We are ill
We are getting scared
It's enough to make anyone weep
We are down to our very last sheep
We will starve if we hang around here
And in Egypt there's food going spare
They've got corn
They've got meat
They've got fruit and drinks
And if we have the time
We could see the Sphinx
So they finally decided to go
Here we go!
Off to Egypt to see brother Jo
--- Unknown ---
Oh no - not he
How you can accuse him is a mystery
Save him - take me
Benjamin is straighter
than the tall palm tree
Oh, yes - its true
Benjamin is straighter
than the big bamboo
No ifs, No buts
Benjamin is honest as coconuts
La la la la la la la la...
--- Unknown ---
So Jacob came to Egypt
No longer feeling old
And Joseph came to meet him
In his chariot
Of gold
Of gold
Of gold
Give me my colored coat
My amazing colored coat
Give me my colored coat
