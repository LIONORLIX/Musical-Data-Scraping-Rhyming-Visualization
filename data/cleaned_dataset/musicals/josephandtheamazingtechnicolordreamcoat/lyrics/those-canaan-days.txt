------ Those Canaan Days ------
--- Unknown ---
Simeon
--- Unknown ---
Do you remember the good years in Canaan?
The summers were endlessly gold
The fields were a patchwork of clover
The winters  were never too cold
We'd stroll down the boulevards together
And averything round us was fine
Jacob
--- Unknown ---
Now the fileds are dead and bare
No joie de vivre anywhere
Et maintenant we drink a bitter wine
Brothers
--- Unknown ---
Those Canaan days we used to know
Where have they gone, where did they go?
Eh bien, raise your berets
To those Canaan days
Simeon
--- Unknown ---
Do you remember those wonderful parties?
The splendour of Canaan's cuisine
Our extravagant, elegant soirees
The gayest the Bible has seen
It's funny but since we lost Joseph
We've gone to the other extreme
No-one comes to dinner now
We only eat them anyhow
I even find I'm missing Joseph's dreams

Simeon
--- Unknown ---
It's funny but since we lost Joseph
We've gone to the other extreme
Perhaps we all misjudged the lad
Perhaps he wasn't quite that bad
And how we miss his entertaining dreams
