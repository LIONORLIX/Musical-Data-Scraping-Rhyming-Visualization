I dreamed that in the fields one day,
The corn gave me sign
Your eleven sheaves of corn
All turned and bowed to mine
I dreamed I saw eleven stars,
The sun the moon and sky
Bowing down before my star,
And now I realise why
How do I know where you came from?
You could be spies
Telling me that you are hungry -
That could be lies
How do I know who you are?
Why do you think I should help you?
Would you help me?
Why on earth should I believe you?
I've no guarantee

Grovel, grovel, cringe, bow, stoop, fall
Worship, worship, beg, kneel, sponge, crawl
Brothers
--- Unknown ---
We are just eleven brothers,
Good men and true
Though we know we count for nothing
When up next to you
Honesty's are middle name
Life is slowly ebbing from us,
Hope's almost gone
It's getting very hard to see us
From sideways on

I rather like the way you're talking,
Astute and sincere
Suddenly your tragic story
It gets me right here
Brothers

This is what we hoped he'd say
Jospeh

All this tugging at my heartstrings
Seems quite justified
I shall give you what you came for
And lots more beside

Joseph handed them sackloads of food
And they grovelled with base gratitude

Then, unseen, Joseph out around the back
And planted a cup in young Benjamin's sack

When the brothers were ready to go
Jospeh turned to them all
With a terrible stare and said
