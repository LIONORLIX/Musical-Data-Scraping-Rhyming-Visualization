------ Any Dream Will Do ------
--- Unknown ---
Joseph
--- Unknown ---
I closed my eyes, drew back the curtain
To see for certain what I thought I knew
Far far away, someone was weeping
But the world was sleeping
Any dream will do
--- Unknown ---
Joseph & Children
--- Unknown ---
I wore my coat, with golden lining
Bright colours shining, wonderful and new
And in the east, the dawn was breaking
And the world was waking
Any dream will do
--- Unknown ---
Joseph
--- Unknown ---
A crash of drums, a flash of light
My golden coat flew out of sight
The colours faded into darkness
I was left alone
--- Unknown ---
Joseph & Children
--- Unknown ---
May I return to the beginning
The light is dimming, and the dream is too
The world and I, we are still waiting
Still hesitating
Any dream will do
Joseph
--- Unknown ---
A crash of drums, a flash of light
My golden coat flew out of sight
The colours faded into darkness
I was left alone
--- Unknown ---
Joseph & Children
--- Unknown ---
May I return to the beginning
The light is dimming, and the dream is too
The world and I, we are still waiting
Still hesitating
