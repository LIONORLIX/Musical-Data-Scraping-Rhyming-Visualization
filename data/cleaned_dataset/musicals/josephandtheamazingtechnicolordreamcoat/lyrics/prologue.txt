Some folks dream of the wonders they'll do
Before their time on this planet is through
Some just don't have anything planned
They hide their hopes and their heads in the sand
Now I don't say who is wrong, who is right
But if by chance you are here for the night
Then all I need is an hour or two
To tell the tale of a dreamer like you
We all dream a lot - some are lucky, some are not
But if you think it, want it, dream it, then it's real
You are what you feel
--- Unknown ---
But all that I say can be told another way
