------ Till Good Luck Comes My Way ------
--- Unknown ---
(RAVENAL enters from the saloon, followed by MEN)
RAVENAL
The man who ventures with chance
Is the man who's adding the salt, romance,
To a world
That otherwise is dark and drear.
The sane conservative lot
Have their fate secure in a guarded spot
Of the world,
They're welcome to their drab career.
--- TENORS ---
It is all well enough to be grinning
While your winnings grow,
But when Fortune reverses her spinning,
Life is not a-glowing.
--- BASSES ---
It is easy to be grinning
While your stack is growing,
But when Fortune reverses her spinning
Life is not a-glowing.
--- ALL MEN ---
That is why we like to see
Someone who can be
Unconcerned and free
Like you.
--- RAVENAL ---
If I am losing today
I will take my loss and I'll pay
For I know that in time my luck will turn,
It's bound to turn.
Till good luck comes my way
I'll play along,
While there's a game on the highway
I'll stray along
With just the turn of a wheel
Or the flip of a card as my guide.
I let fate decide
If I walk or ride.
Why sit alone with your sorrow
And kill the day?
There may be sunshine tomorrow
To fill the day.
While I've a heart and a brain
And my ebony cane
I can borrow
Until the day when good luck comes my way.
--- MEN ---
Never venture, never gain;
Men of caution, it is plain.
Fortune will change like an April day,
So we will wait till good luck
Will come our way!
--- RAVENAL ---
Never venture, never gain;
Men of caution, it is plain,
Live in vain,
So I will wait till good luck
