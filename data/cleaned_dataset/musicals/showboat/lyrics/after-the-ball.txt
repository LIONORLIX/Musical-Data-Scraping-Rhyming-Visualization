------ After the Ball ------
--- JIM ---
Ladies and gentlemen - I regret to announce that Miss Julie Wandell
is indisposed and cannot appear tonight.
Now wait, wait please. We are fortunate, however in obtaining the
services of Miss Magnolia Ravenal, who will sing for you an old
favorite.
--- DRUNK ---
Magnolia Ravenal - who the hell is she?
--- ANDY ---
I'll show you who the hell she is!
(MAGNOLIA enters and comes down stage. She starts to
sing rather timidly and is ill at ease)
--- MAGNOLIA ---
A little maiden
Climbed an old man's knee,
Begged for a story,
Do, Uncle, please.
--- ANDY ---
Quiet!
--- MAGNOLIA ---
Why are you single?
Why live alone?
--- ANDY ---
Quiet!
--- A MAN ---
Get the hook!
--- MAGNOLIA ---
Have you no babies?
Have you no home?
--- ANDY ---
Nola!
(She turns in the opposite direction to where he is
sitting, but is evidently trying to see who called her.
The CROWD grows noisier)
--- MAGNOLIA ---
I had a sweetheart,
Years, years ago,
--- ANDY ---
Nolie!
--- MAGNOLIA ---
Where she is now, pet,
You will soon know.
(She has begun to sing quite well
and the CROWD grows quiet)
List to the story,
I'll tell it all,
--- ANDY ---
Smile, Nola!
--- MAGNOLIA ---
I believed her faithless
After the ball.
After the ball is over,
After the break of morn,
After the dancers leaving,
After the stars are gone;
Many a heart is aching,
If you could read them all;
Many the hopes that have vanished
After the ball!
--- ANDY ---
Everybody!
--- ALL ---
After the ball is over,
After the break of morn,
After the dancers leaving,
After the stars are gone;
Many a heart is aching,
If you could read them all;
Many the hopes that have vanished
After the ball.
--- ANDY ---
Happy New Year!
(ANDY takes MAGNOLIA in his arms.
General merriment. Blackout)
