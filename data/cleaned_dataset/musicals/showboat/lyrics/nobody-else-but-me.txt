------ Nobody Else but Me ------
--- Unknown ---
I want to be
No-one but me,
I am in love
With a Lover who likes me
The way I am,
I have my faults,
He likes my faults,
I'm not very bright,
He's not very bright.
--- Unknown ---
He thinks I'm grand,
That's grand for me,
He may be wrong
But if we get along,
What do we care say we.
When he holds me close,
Close as we can be,
I tell the Lad
That I'm grateful and I'm glad
