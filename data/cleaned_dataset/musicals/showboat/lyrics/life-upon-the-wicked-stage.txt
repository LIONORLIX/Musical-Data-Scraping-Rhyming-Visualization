------ Life Upon the Wicked Stage ------
--- ELLIE ---
Why do stage struck maidens clamor
To be actin' in the drammer?
--- GIRLS ---
We've heard say
You are gay
Night and day.
--- ELLIE ---
Oh, go 'way!
--- GIRLS ---
We drink water from a dipper,
You drink champagne from a slipper.
--- ELLIE ---
Tho' it seems Crool to bust
All your dreams,
Still I must;
Here's the truth I tell you:
Life upon the wicked stage
Ain't ever what a girl supposes;
Stage door Johnnies aren't rag-
Ing over you with gems and roses.
When you let a feller hold your hand (which
Means an extra beer or sandwich),
Ev'rybody whispers: Ain't her life a whirl?
Though you're warned against a rou√©
Ruining your reputation,
I have played around
The one night trade around
A great big nation:
Wild old men who give you jewels and sables
Only live in Aesop's Fables.
Life upon the wicked stage
Ain't nothin' for a girl.
--- GIRLS ---
Though we've listened to you moan and grieve, you
Must pardon us if we do not believe you,
There is no doubt
You're crazy about
Your awful stage!
--- ELLIE ---
I admit it's fun
To smear my face with paint,
Causing ev'ryone
To think I'm what I ain't,
And I like to play a demi-mondy role
With soul!
Ask the hero does he
Like the way I lure
When I play a hussy
Or a paramour,
Yet when once the curtain's down
My life is pure,
And how I dread it!
--- GIRLS ---
Life upon the wicked stage
Ain't ever what a girl supposes,
Stage door Johnnies aren't rag-
Ing over you with gems and roses.
--- ELLIE ---
If some gentleman would talk with reason
I would cancel all next season.
Life upon the wicked stage
Ain't nothin' for a girl!
--- GIRLS ---
You'd be back the season after!
