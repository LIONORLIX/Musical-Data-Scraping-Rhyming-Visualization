------ Goodbye, My Lady Love ------
--- Unknown ---
So you're going away
Because my heart has gone astray
And you promised me
That you would always faithful be.
--- Unknown ---
Go to him you love
And be as true as stars above.
But your heart will yearn
And then someday you will return
--- Unknown ---
Goodbye, my lady love,
Farewell, my turtle dove,
You are the idol and darling of my heart,
But some day you will come back to me
And love me tenderly,
So goodbye, my lady love, goodbye.
--- Unknown ---
When the dewdrops fall
This then your heart, I know, will call.
So beware, my dove,
Don't trust your life to some false love.
--- Unknown ---
But if you must go,
Remember, dear, I love you so;
Sure as the stars do shine,
You'll think of when I called you mine.
--- Unknown ---
Goodbye, my lady love,
Farewell my turtle dove,
You are the idol and darling of my heart,
But some day you will come back to me
And love me tenderly,
