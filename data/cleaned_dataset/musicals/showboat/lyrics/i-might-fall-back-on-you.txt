------ I Might Fall Back on You ------
--- FRANK ---
Little girl, you are safe with me:
I can protect what's mine;
I am a sturdy maple tree
And you're my clinging vine!
--- ELLIE ---
Woods are just full of maple trees,
Cedar and oak and pine;
Let me look them over, please,
And then I'll let you know
If you have a show.
After I have looked around
The world for a mate,
Then, perhaps, I might fall back on you!
When I am convinced
That there is no better fate,
Then I might decide that you will do.
--- FRANK ---
I am just an average lad,
Though no gift to womanhood,
Some girls say I'm not so bad!
--- ELLIE ---
Others say you're not so good!
But if you are patient, dear,
And willing to wait,
There's a chance I might fall back on you!
