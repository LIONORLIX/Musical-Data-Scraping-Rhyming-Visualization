If she can make a living talking to the dead
If she hears the conversations and knows what was said
Then she may be a princess, more than just a mortal

Trust me she’s the real deal

She looks around with her third eye, she sees the future today

Cause she’s connected and crossing over
She’s our salvation on the other side

Only she can take us there
We’re talking bout a miracle
If only she can see it all
Everything from here to there

OK, you can do this; just remember it’s a gift
You got the gift girl, pull yourself together
Where’s my Red Bull
