------ Ball of Wax ------
--- Unknown ---
(Sam, Hospital Ghost and Ensemble)
--- Hospital Ghost ---
Shot huh? That will do it every time, poor kid
--- Sam ---
Who are you, what am I doing here?
--- Hospital Ghost ---
Now listen young man, there’s so much to tell
First let me assure you that this isn’t hell
It aint heaven either so you might as well relax
Cause this my son is a whole new ball of wax
--- Unknown ---
It aint like before and can be lonely at first
There’s an echo of hunger and not quite a thirst
And if you thought it was over with a tag on your toe
And a bag with a zipper well im afraid it aint so
--- Sam ---
I don’t have time for this
--- Hospital Ghost ---
Once you understand there’s no hurry to wait
You don’t have to worry cause you’ll never be late
There’s no rush at all and once you get in the flow
You’ll learn that eternity is steady as you go
--- Unknown ---
There’s not much here to do so if you’re feeling blue
I got a trick that will help see you through
It’s a little dance we like to do
And we’d be happy to teach it to you
--- Unknown ---
It goes something like this
--- Unknown ---
That kinda works for me
--- Unknown ---
Let me tell you a secret
Doors aint as bad as you think
Zip zap, they aint nothing at all
You’ll see!
--- Sam ---
Who are all these people?
--- Hospital Ghost ---
Who are they? They’re ghosts
--- Sam ---
Ghosts?
--- Hospital Ghost ---
Yeah, like us
--- Sam ---
No this isn’t happening
I am not dead
--- Ghost ---
Hey, you look dead to me
--- Sam ---
I’m too young to die!
--- Ghost ---
That’s what everyone says
--- Sam ---
But I’m not ready.
Do you understand me, I’m not ready.
--- Ghosts ---
Who’s ready?
Hey nobody’s ready
--- Sam ---
No, can somebody help me please? Anybody?
--- Ghost ---
Scream all you want, nobody’s listening
You can yell all day, they can’t hear us
They don’t hear a word
--- Sam ---
How did you all get here?
--- Ghosts ---
I was supposed to be in Chicago
We were a mile from the church;
The car ran off the road
It was the biggest tornado
--- Unknown ---
It’s just like no time, so don’t put up a fight
No more than full time, cause there’s no day or night
Just let it flow time, cause there’s no end in sight
You know there’s no time, we’re on the other side
--- Unknown ---
No time, slow time
Look out the low time
--- Doctor ---
Hurry, we’re loosing her
Apply compression
--- Hospital Ghost ---
She’s not gonna make it
I’ve seen it I know
It’s either look up above
Or look out below
--- Unknown ---
You never know which way the winds gonna blow
Up or down it’s a crash
Who knows where they’ll go
We’re getting down to brass tacks
Like I told you before,
It’s a whole new ball of wax
--- Doctor ---
She’s gone
--- Ghosts ---
There is no day, there is no night
--- Sam ---
No, no I can’t watch this
I wanna go back
I wanna go back
--- Ghosts ---
There’s no way of fighting, so go with the ride
Don’t worry, don’t hurry, just let it all slide
You can’t do it all because there’s no going back
We get you reminded, but there’s nothing you lack
--- Unknown ---
We’re all human history, it’s always a mystery
Some peasant, some bard, some girl we don’t know
But till the moment you really don’t know
Its like we told you before,
It’s a whole new ball of wax
