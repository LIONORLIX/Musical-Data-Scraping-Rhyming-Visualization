Its fight or flight, New York
Cause it the way were driven

Were just playing a numbers game
Every second the numbers change
This is what I live to feel
It?s the beauty of the deal
This is the essence of high finance
So many steps when you do this dance
This is always such a brush
Sending millions with one touch

This is the life, New York
Makes you feel invincible
You are the city keeping score
New York every ones invisible
You are the city keeping score

More and more and more and more and more
More and more and more and more and more
