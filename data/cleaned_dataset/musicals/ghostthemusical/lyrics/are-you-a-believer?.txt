Mrs Santiago, I’m Oda Mae Brown

Praise be to Jesus, let us pray
I believe he’s gonna be with us today

But there’s no telling about those spirits up there
You can phone them up till you’re blue in the face
They go shop and play bingo, run everywhere
They can hardly stay in one place
--- Unknown ---
So you gotta get ready, you gotta prepare
If you really want to reach up there
You can yell, you can cry, you can shout
You got to test out your doubt
--- Unknown ---
Are you a believer, are you ready,
Are you ready to believe
Are you ready, tell me are you ready
Are you a receiver, are you ready,
Are you ready to receive
Are you ready, tell me are you ready
Are you a believer, are you a believer,
Are you ready to believe
Are you a receiver, are you ready,
Are you ready to receive
Are you ready, tell me are you ready
--- Unknown ---
We’re calling all spirits;
We’re waiting by the phone
Don’t leave us hanging here praying all alone
We’re just standing why don’t you just…
--- Unknown ---
Feel it now, we’re entering the zone
Come on Lord, bring it on down home
Don’t just sit there resting on your throne
Give us a sign, throw us a bone
--- Unknown ---
Come on down, come on down
We’re waiting here lord awaiting to be shown
Come on down, come on down
Gathering your mystery, touching me alone
Come on down, come on down
I can feel it, I know it’s real
So come on down
--- Unknown ---
Praise the Lord, I think I feel something
Is it a man?
--- Rosa ---
Yes, my husband, Julio
--- Oda Mae ---
And did Julio know someone who’s passed over?
Someone named Anna……. Mary……. Consuela……. Maria?
--- Rosa ---
Si, si his mamma, she’s Maria

--- Oda Mae ---
I’m afraid this is too hard
Now I got two souls I’ve got to contact
Julio and Maria

It’s difficult you know
The pain, the effort
--- Louise/Clara ---
The pain, the effort

His spirit is infusing me and breaking me down
Your gonna see it right before your eyes
Hold on tight and watch me be transmogrified
--- Unknown ---
Tell me are you ready,
Is she really really ready to believe
Come on sisters,
Don’t leave me by myself now, you know I need you
Feel the spirit, let it move you, move you
You believe, you believe
You believe, you believe
You believe, you believe
Ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready
--- Rosa ---
Oh yeah, I believe
--- Oda/Louise/Clara ---
So come on, so come on, so come on, so come on down!
