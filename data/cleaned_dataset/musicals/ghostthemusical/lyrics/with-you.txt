------ With You ------

(Molly)

I picked up your shirts this morning
I don’t know why, I don’t know why
Mr Reynolds said to say hello
I started to cry, I started to cry
Every place we ever walked and
Everywhere we talked, I miss you
You never leave my mind
So much of you is left behind
--- Unknown ---
You took my days with you
Took my nights with you
--- Unknown ---
Those unfinished conversations
We used to have still speak to me
And I write you letters every day
That I’ll never send and you’ll never see
All this wishful thinking
Gets me nowhere I can’t stay
Though my heart is broken
It keeps breaking every day
--- Unknown ---
You took my hopes with you
Took my dreams with you
--- Unknown ---
I keep thinking that you’ll be calling
Everyone says that it’s all in my head
And I can’t accept it yet
I’m not ready to just give in
I know that I can’t live in this pain
With these feelings of regret
I can’t comprehend this
And pretend that I don’t care
Any place I wanna be
I wanna see you there
--- Unknown ---
You took my life with you
Took my world with you
