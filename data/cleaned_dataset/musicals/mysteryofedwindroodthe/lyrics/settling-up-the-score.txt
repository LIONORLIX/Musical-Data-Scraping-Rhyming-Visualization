------ Settling Up the Score ------
--- Puffer ---
Here to track this man in black am I,
With one clue as to the who and why!
--- Datchery ---
I find myself
In this aggravating form and face,
Gravitating to this place,
Navigating t'wards this case!
--- Puffer & Datchery ---
I've come to town, my ear at every door,
Half the clown, yet crafty at the core.
Settling down to settle up the score.
A kettle full of fish I'll fry,
I'll cook each goose, (to mix a metaphor),
and unloose a mighty meteor -
I'm settling down to settle up the score
--- Datchery ---
My mettle will be more than tested!
--- Datchery & Puffer ---
A debt'll be repaid before I've rested - oh!
--- Datchery ---
Drood,
--- Puffer ---
No word,
--- Datchery ---
What's brewed,
--- Puffer ---
No grave,
--- Datchery ---
No tomb...
--- Datchery & Puffer ---
Who'll say who's done what and why to whom?
--- Datchery ---
I'm on the scent, I'm inventing everything I am...
--- Puffer ---
Where's the sacrificial lamb?
--- Datchery ---
'Ere in bloody Cloisterham
--- Puffer & Datchery ---
I've come to town to ask at every door:
Did Edwin Drood drown or was he washed ashore?
I'm settling down to settle up the score:
Red herring on a briny beach!
--- Unknown ---
I'll solve this yet
As Grand Inquisitor!
Make a bet
You've met me once before!
Make a threat?
I only wish you would!
