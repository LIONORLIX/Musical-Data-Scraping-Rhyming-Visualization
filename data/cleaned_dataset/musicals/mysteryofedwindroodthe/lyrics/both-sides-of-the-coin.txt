------ Both Sides of the Coin ------
--- Jasper ---
I am not myself these days - for all I
know I might be you.
There's more than room enough for two inside my mind.
--- Sapsea ---
I am likewise in a haze of who I am from
scene to scene;
What's more we two, (we four, I mean)
are in a bind!
--- Jasper ---
For is it I or is it me?
--- Sapsea ---
And if I'm him and if I'm he, each on of us might not
Agree on what to do.
--- Jasper ---
And if I take opposing sides within myself,
Then who divides up what is right or wrong?
Sapsea:
I'll go along with you.
--- Both ---
Ha'penny, one penny, tupenny, thrupenny
Twelve to a shilling, twice that to a florin
To find the same face on both sides of the coin?
Bob is your uncle from pennies to guineas,
The two-sided mint is the rule, not exception,
And would you not quite feel quite the fool of deception
To find the same face on both sides of the coin?
--- Sapsea ---
Odds or evens, it's high or low
It's up or down or night
--- Jasper ---
Heads or tails, or black and white,
Or left and right or day!
--- Sapsea ---
Nature seldom ever fails to most obligingly provide
An undisclosed opposing side to one's dismay.
--- Jasper ---
There's shadows on this shining morn,
--- Sapsea ---
If there's a rose it bears a thorn,
--- Jasper ---
You're as good as dead as soon as born,
--- Both ---
And yet we smile!
--- Sapsea ---
But luck's division is perverse
--- Jasper ---
It seems to work more in reverse
--- Sapsea ---
If things are better, they'll be worse in just a while!
