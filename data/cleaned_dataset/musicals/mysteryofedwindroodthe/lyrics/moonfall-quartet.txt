------ Moonfall Quartet ------
--- Rosa ---
I fear the Moonfall, I fear the
Night skies,
Bright eyes will burn me,
Blind me
Find me undressed and all revealing,
Kneeling before his view.
--- Helena ---
Moon of fallen souls! I fear the
Night disguises you.
Night arises, you will burn then
Blindingly you'll fade. But pay no
Mind to me, unrest is all I
Feel, oh English child
Ner, oh English child....
Nearer than the moon am I to you.
--- Rosa, Alice, Beatrice ---
Each one of us must sometime
Wait to meet with love and never
Know its name, his name -
But in the Moonfall soon all fears are few,
