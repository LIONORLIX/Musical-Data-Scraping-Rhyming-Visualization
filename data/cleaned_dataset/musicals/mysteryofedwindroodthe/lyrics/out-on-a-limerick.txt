------ Out on a Limerick ------
--- Rosa ---
Thank God for that.
The sheep has been sheared!
I don?t know how men live
Through heat with a beard.
Gladly I shed
This tent of a coat.
My explanation
I now emote!
--- Unknown ---
My motive in taking the role
Of a wigg?d and white-whiskered soul
Was to ably disguise
My most feminine size
When I?d take an inquiring stroll.
For strangers who?ll chat with a chap
And reveal this and that in a snap
Are remarkably leery
Of women who query
Too much; it?s a great handicap.
So this disguise saw me through it!
Playing the part of a man!
Really, there?s nothing much to it.
Most any animal can,
Climbing out on a limerick,
Out on a limerick,
Out on a limerick air.
--- Unknown ---
I found a theatrical kit,
And as Datchery I did my bit.
So to clear Neville?s name.
(I confess to my shame
?Twas for vengeance as well, I admit.)
I followed John Jasper high-low,
Found the dens he descends to below,
And when he surfaced here
?Twas immediately clear:
My suspicions were quite apropos.
So I crept to the lodgings of Jasper,
Dressed in this garb (what a sight!)
There I found my mother?s clasp?
The one I gave Edwin that night.
Jasper took it from Ned
After hurling him dead
Towards the weir riverbed, I suppose!
--- Unknown ---
Rosa Bud ? Datchery ? knows!
And the proof is quite clear,
Let us bring Jasper here
To be tried and then tied up and strung!
--- Unknown ---
And from this limerick,
Let him be hung!
--- Neville ---
Thank God for that!
I gladly unmask.
To wear this coat in June
Is too great a task.
There lies Dick Datch?ry,
Born on a whim.
We can dispense with
Last rites for him!
--- Unknown ---
My motive in taking the role
Of a wigg?d and white-whiskered soul
Was to get myself back
To the city, and track
Down the culprit. With that as my goal,
I had also intended to find
Just what Jasper had had on his mind,
Much too eager is he
That all Cloisterham see
Me the murderer ? God, are they blind!
All of these people suspicious
That I had killed Edwin Drood,
And with their anger so vicious,
I wore this costume so crude,
Stepping out on a limerick,
Out on a limerick,
Out on a limerick air!
--- Unknown ---
I found a theatrical kit,
And as Datchery I did my bit.
So to clear my good name
From the blemish of blame.
I followed John Jasper high low,
Found the dens he descends to below,
And when Puffer came here
?Twas immediately clear:
My suspicions were quite apropos.
So I crept in the lodgings of Jasper,
Dressed in this garb (what a sight!)
There I found Rosa Bud?s clasp?
Her mother?s she gave Drood that night!
Jasper took it from Ned
After hurling him dead
Towards the weir riverbed, I suppose!
--- Unknown ---
Tell him that Datchery knows!
And the proof is quite clear,
Let us bring Jasper here
To be tried and then tied up and strung!
--- Unknown ---
And from this limerick,
Let him be hung!
