------ Puffer's Confession ------
--- PUFFER ---
Oh God, have mercy: your forgiveness do I need!
My string of sins ends here with this most dreadful deed!
I only meant to save my Rosa, but it?s true?
Oh, you bastard Jasper! Christ, I meant to murder you.
--- Unknown ---
Could I see my Rosebud threatened
By this man of massive sin?
He?d revealed his vile desires
So I had to do him in!
To my endless ruination
I took smoke to see me through.
In my sweet hallucination,
I saw Drood ? and thought him you!
--- Unknown ---
So I say to all who hear me
You must plan a murder well.
You must view your victim clearly,
As you send him off to Hell!
When I killed, ?twas well-intended,
Drink and smoke what did me in.
For my sins, I?m apprehended:
Them?s the wages of sin!
--- Unknown ---
(Spoken)
Come on. Give your old love some help with the last line then, hey?
--- Puffer & Audience ---
With the wages of sin!
--- Puffer (spoken) ---
Cor? bloody hell! Don?t you know they ?ang women these days?
This is undoubtedly me last chorus!
--- Unknown ---
Puffer & Audience
With the wages of sin!
