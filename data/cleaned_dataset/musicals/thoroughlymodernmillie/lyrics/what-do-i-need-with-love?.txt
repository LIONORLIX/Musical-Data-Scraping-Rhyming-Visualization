------ What Do I Need with Love? ------
--- JIMMY ---
Oh, the places I would like to show you
Although I hardly know you
I've a funny feeling we make a perfect pair
Famous sites I want to see you seeing
Then nights of you and me-ing
Me. You. We -
Wait a minute! Just a minute! No, no, no, no!
--- Unknown ---
I'm a Joe with just oen aim
Ev'ry night to date a diff'rent dame
Call each one of 'em the same pet name
Hey, baby!
In a row, I have my ducks
Loads of gals to give me loads of yucks
Leave the cooing to the other clucks
I don't mean maybe
Got it good. What do I need with love?
--- Unknown ---
Always practice what I preach
Keep temptation out of easy reach
Stick to dolls who wash their hair in bleach
I'm happy
Come and go the way I choose
Never gonna sing the tied-down blues
Other guys would kill to fill my shoes
No wing-clipped sappy
Got it good. What do I need with love?
--- Unknown ---
That was a near miss, talk about a close shave
Flirted with disaster
There must be someone up there watching over me
Talk about a four-leaf-clover-me
Peter Rabbit's missing footsie
Means I roll without a tootsie
--- Unknown ---
Got it good. What do I need with love?
I got it good. What do I need with love?
--- Unknown ---
Skip the vows and all that rot
Tell the minister that I do not
Bright and breezy is the -
Birds and bees-y is the -
Free and easy is the life I got
--- Unknown ---
Without her.
--- Unknown ---
Although I hardly know you
What do I need with love?
I got it good
Got it good
