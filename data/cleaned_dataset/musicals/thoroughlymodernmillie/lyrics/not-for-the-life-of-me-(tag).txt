They said I would sing the homesick blues

Granny dear, Mother mine
Old and gray at twenty-nine
Calloused hands, broken heart
Dreams that die before you start
--- Unknown ---
I ain't got nothing, so I ain't got nothing to lose!
Who needs a hat? Who needs a purse?
And who needs you, mister whoever-you-are,
'cause I'm a pioneer woman, pal!
The Woolworth building! The Met Life Tower!
There's gold in them there hills, and I'm gonna get it or die trying!

Not for the life of
Not for the life of me!

Where the light is always red
Gotta be more than an old ghost town
Where the ghost ain't even dead
--- Unknown ---
Clap your hands, just because
Where I am ain't where I was
Not for the life of
Me, Me, Me, Me, Me
Boh-doh-dee-oh
Not for the life of
