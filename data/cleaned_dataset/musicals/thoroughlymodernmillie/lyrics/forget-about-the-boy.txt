------ Forget About the Boy ------
--- MILLIE ---
No canary in a tree for me
This canary's ready to fly free
--- Unknown ---
Cut the cord
Is that a man I once adored?
He's nothing but an albatross
No great loss
Doublecrosser
Forget about the boy
Pull the plug
Ain't he the one who pulled the rug
He's lower than an alley cat
Dirty rat
And I flatter
Forget about the boy
Forget about the boy
Forget about the boy
--- Unknown ---
And in the moonlight
Don't you think about him
Sister, you're much better off without him
You can blow the blues a kiss goodbye
And put the sun back in the sky
For when he comes crawlin'
I'm not fallin'
--- Unknown ---
Shout hooray and halleluh!
Now me and mister wrong are through
I'll find myself another beau
Who I know is no rover
Forget about the boy
Forget about the boy
Forget about -

Jimmy, oh Jimmy, silly boy
Gee, what a real swell guy
--- MISS FLANNERY and TYPISTS (at the same time) ---
Cut the cord, is that a man I once adored?
He's nothing but an albatross
No great loss, doublecrosser
--- ALL ---
Forget about the boy
--- MILLIE ---
Jimmy, oh Jimmy, what great joy
He makes my troubles fly
--- MISS FLANNERY and TYPISTS (at the same time) ---
Pull the plug, ain't he the one who pulled the rug?
He's lower than an alley cat, dirty rat
And I flatter
--- Unknown ---
ALL: Forget about the boy
Forget about the boy
Forget about the boy!

(The typists break into defiant tap, topped by MISS FLANNERY in a tap solo.)

Shout hooray and halleluh!
Now that me and mister wrong are through
I'll find myself another beau
Who I know is no rover

Hallelujah!
Forget about the boy
