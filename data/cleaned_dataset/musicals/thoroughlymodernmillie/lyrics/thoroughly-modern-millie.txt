------ Thoroughly Modern Millie ------
--- ENSEMBLE MEN ---
There are those, I suppose
Think we're mad, heaven knows
The world has gone to rack and to ruin
--- WOMAN #1 ---
What we think is chic
--- WOMAN #2 ---
Unique
--- WOMEN #3 & #4 ---
And quite adorable
--- ENSEMBLE WOMEN ---
They think is odd and Sodom and Gomorrah-ble!
--- MILLIE ---
But the fact is,
Everything today is thoroughly modern
--- ENSEMBLE ---
Check your personality
--- MILLIE ---
Everything today makes yesterday slow
--- ENSEMBLE ---
Better face reality
--- MILLIE ---
It's not insanity
Says Vanity Fair
In fact, it's stylish to
--- MILLIE AND ENSEMBLE WOMEN ---
Raise your skirts and bob your hair
--- MILLIE ---
Have you seen the way they kiss in the movies
--- ENSEMBLE MEN ---
Isn't it delectable?
--- MILLIE AND ENSEMBLE WOMEN ---
Painting lips and pencil lining your brow
Now is quite respectable
--- MILLIE ---
Good-bye, good goody girl
I'm changing and how
--- ENSEMBLE ---
So beat the drums 'cause here comes
Thoroughly Modern Millie now
What we think is chic, unique and quite adorable
They think is odd and Sodom and Gomorrah-ble!
But the fact is
Everything today is thoroughly modern
--- ENSEMBLE MEN ---
Bands are getting jazzier
--- ENSEMBLE ---
Everything today is starting to go
--- ENSEMBLE WOMEN ---
Cars are getting snazzier
--- ENSEMBLE ---
Men say it's criminal what women'll do
What they're forgetting is
--- MILLIE ---
This is 1922!
--- MILLIE AND ENSEMBLE ---
Good-bye, good goody girl
I'm changing and how
--- Unknown ---
MILLIE: I'm changing and how!
--- ALL ---
So beat the drums 'cause here comes thoroughly
Hot off the press! One step ahead! Jazz age!
Whoopee baby! We're so thoroughly modern
--- MILLIE ---
Millie!
