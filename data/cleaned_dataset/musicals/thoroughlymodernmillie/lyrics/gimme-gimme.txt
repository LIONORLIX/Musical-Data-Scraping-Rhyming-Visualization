------ Gimme Gimme ------
--- MILLIE ---
A simple choice, nothing more
This or that, either or
Marry well, social whirl, business man, clever girl
Or pin my future on a green glass love
What kind of life am I dreaming of?
--- Unknown ---
I say gimme, gimme ... gimme, gimme
Gimme, gimme that thing called love
I want it
Gimme, gimme that thing called love
I need it
Highs and lows, tears and laughter
Gimme happy ever after
Gimme, gimme that thing called love
--- Unknown ---
Gimme, gimme that thing called love
I crave it
Gimme, gimme that thing called love
I'll brave it
Thick 'n thin, rich or poor time
Gimme years and I'll want more time
Gimme, gimme that thing called love
--- Unknown ---
Gimme, gimme that thing called love
I'm free now
Gimme, gimme that thing called love
I see now
Fly, dove! Sing, sparrow!
Gimme Cupid's famous arrow
Gimme, gimme that thing called love
--- Unknown ---
I don't care if he's a nobody
In my heart he'll be a somebody
Somebody to love me!
--- Unknown ---
I need it
Gimme, gimme that thing called love
I want it
Here I am, St. Valentine
My bags are packed, I'm first in line
Aphrodite, don't forget me
Romeo and Juliet me
Fly, dove! Sing, sparrow!
Gimme fat boy's famous arrow
