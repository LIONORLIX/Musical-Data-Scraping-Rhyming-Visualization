------ Jimmy ------
--- MILLIE ---
Am I drunk? Or maybe I'm dreaming
I oughta be screaming! He suddenly -
--- Unknown ---
Everything today is thoroughly -
--- Unknown ---
Just like that, without any warning
At two in the morning, he suddenly -
--- Unknown ---
Everything today is thoroughly -
--- Unknown ---
Were there signs, and I didn't see them?
A random remark, occasional sigh
That day in the park, the gleam in his eye
--- Unknown ---
Everything today is thoroughly -
Everything today is thoroughly -
--- Unknown ---
Jimmy, oh Jimmy, silly boy
Gee, what a real swell guy
Jimmy, oh Jimmy, oh what joy
He makes my troubles fly
His glance had fireworks in it
We kissed, my heart did a
Whiz-bang, flip-flop
Heaven for a minute
--- Unknown ---
Jimmy, oh Jimmy, don't you know
What I can't quite confess?
So coax me, implore me
I promise you won't bore me
Jimmy I might say yes
--- Unknown ---
He makes my troubles fly
His glance had fireworks in it
We kissed, my heart did a
Whiz-bang, flip-flop
Heaven for a minute
--- Unknown ---
Jimmy, oh Jimmy, don't you know
What I can't quite confess?
So coax me, implore me
I promise you won't bore me
