------ Only in New York ------
--- MUZZY ---
The wonders of the world are said to stop at seven
But truth to tell my figures don't agree
I number them at eight, with one so close to Heaven
The others pale, their magic stale
Just take a look and see
--- Unknown ---
Step right up to Treasure Isle
Ev'ry inch of it, a sky-high mile
Fairytale land
Only in New York
--- Unknown ---
Hey castle-builder
Want the moon, and nothing less?
Work for years, then overnight success
I know firsthand
Only in New York
--- Unknown ---
Each day it's free admission to those who dream
You set your sights all the way upstream
Off you go, for you know that cream will rise
--- Unknown ---
Make that wish, seek that thrill
Come and get it, 'cause you always will
Strike up the band
Only in New York
--- Unknown ---
Each day it's free admission to those who dream
You set your sights all the way upstream
Off you go, for you know that cream will rise
Rise!
--- Unknown ---
New, improved and rearranged
It's ever-changing, yet it's never changed
Life on command
Hear what I'm saying, oh but it's grand
That's why I'm staying, right here as planned
Only in New York
Only in New York
