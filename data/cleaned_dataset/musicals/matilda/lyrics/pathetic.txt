Knock on the door, Jenny.
Just knock on the door.
Don't be pathetic!

Knock on the door, Jenny.
There's nothing to fear.
You're being pathetic!
It's just a door, you've seen one before.
Just knock on the door!
--- Unknown ---
Look at you trying to hide, silly.
Standing outside the Principal's Office.
Like a little girl!
It's just ... pathetic!
Ohhh!
--- Unknown ---
Look at you hesitating, hands shaking!
You should be embarrassed!
You're not a little girl.
It's just pathetic.
--- Unknown ---
Knock on the door, Jenny.
What are you waiting for?
Just knock on the door!

Perhaps I will wait.
She's probably having a meeting or something.
And won't want to be interrupted.
If anything, caution in these situations is sensible.
One should avoid confrontation when possible.
I'll come back later then!
