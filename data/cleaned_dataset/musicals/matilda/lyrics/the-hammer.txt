------ The Hammer ------
--- Unknown ---
Look at these trophies
See how my trophies gleam
In the sunlight, see how they shine
--- Unknown ---
What do you think it
took to become English
Hammer-throwing champion
Nineteen-sixty-nine?
--- Unknown ---
Do you think in that moment
When my big moment came
That I treated the rules
With casual disdain
--- Unknown ---
Well, LIKE HELL!
--- Unknown ---
As I stepped up to the circle
did I change my plan? Hmm... what?
As I chalked up my palms
did I wave my hands? I DID NOT!
--- Unknown ---
As I started my spin
did I look at the view?
Did I drift off and dream
for a minute or two?
--- Unknown ---
Do you think I faltered or amended my rotation?
Do you think I altered my intended elevation?
As the hammer took off did I change my grunt
From the grunt I had practiced for many a month?
--- Unknown ---
Not a jot, not a dot did I stray from the plot
Not a detail of my throw was adjusted or forgotten
Not even when the hammer left my hands
And sailed up, up above the stands
--- Unknown ---
Did I let myself go?
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no...
--- Unknown ---
No.

If you want to throw the hammer for your country,
You have to stay inside the circle all the time,
And if you want to make the team,
You dont need happiness or self-esteem,
You just need to keep your feet inside the line.

Sing, children 2, 3, 4!
If you want to throw the hammer for your country,
Habinot est magitem.
You have to stay inside the circle all the time.
Circular! Magitem! Magitem!
And if you want to teach success,
You dont use sympathy or tenderness.
Tenderness
You have to force the little squits to toe the line!

Sing, Jenny 2, 3, 4!
If you want to throw the hammer for your country,
Regotem Regotem varia magitem
You have to stay inside the circle all the time.
Tempero es te iste is.
Apply just one simple rule -
To hammer-throwing, life, and school -
Lifes a ball, so learn to throw it.
Find the bally line, and toe it,
And always keep your feet inside the line.
