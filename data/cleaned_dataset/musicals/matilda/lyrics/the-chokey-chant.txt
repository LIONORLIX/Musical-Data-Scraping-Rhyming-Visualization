------ The Chokey Chant ------
--- NIGEL ---
Oh, Matilda! They say she's going to put me in Chokey!
--- MATILDA ---
What . . . What's Chokey?
--- NIGEL ---
They say it's a cupboard in her office that she throws children into. They say she's lined it with nails, and spikes, and bits of broken glass.
--- BIG KIDS ---
There's a place you are sent if you haven't been good,
--- Unknown ---
BIG KID [BEN]
And it's made of spikes and wood.
--- BIG KIDS ---
And it isn't wide enough to sit.
--- Unknown ---
BIG KID [TAYLOR]
And even if you could,
--- BIG KIDS ---
There are nails on the bottom,
--- Unknown ---
BIG KID [TAYLOR]
So you wish you'd ?
--- BIG KIDS ---
Stood!
When the hinges creak and the door is closed,
You cannot see squat ?
--- Unknown ---
BIG KID [TAMIKA]
Not the end of your nose.
--- BIG KIDS ---
And when you scream, you don't know if the sound came out,
Or if the scream in your head even reached your mouth!
