------ Revolting Children ------
--- Unknown ---
Woah!
Never again will she get the best of me!
Never again will she take away my freedom.
And we won't forget the day we fought
For the right to be a little bit naughty!
Never again will The Chokey door slam!
Never again will I be bullied, and
Never again will I doubt it when
My mummy says I'm a miracle!
Never again!
Never again will we live behind bars!
Never again now that we know...
We are revolting children...
Living in revolting times...
We sing revolting songs
Using revolting rhymes.
We'll be revolting children,
'Til our revolting's done,
And we'll have the Trunchbull vaulting.
We're revolting!
We will become a screaming horde!
Take out your hockey stick, and use it as a sword!
Never again will we be ignored!
We'll find out where the chalk is stored,
And draw rude pictures on the board!
It's not insulting; we're revolting!
We can S-P-L how we like!
If enough of us are wrong,
Wrong is right!
Every word N-O-R-T-Y...
'Cause we're a little bit naughty!
So we ought to stay inside the line.
But If we disobey at the same time,
There is nothing that the Trunchbull can do!
She can take her hammer and S-H-U.
You didn't think you could push us too far,
But there's no going back now, we...
R-E-V-O-L-T-I-N
We're S-I-N-G
U-S-I-N-G...
We'll be R-E-V-O-L-T-I-N-G.
It is 2-L-8-4-U.
E-R-E-volting!
Woah!!!
