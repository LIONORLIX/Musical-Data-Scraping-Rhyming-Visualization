------ This Little Girl ------

Stop being pathetic, Jenny.
Stop pretending, Jenny.
That you are going to march in there and give them a piece of your mind!
--- Unknown ---
Leave it alone Jenny!
The more that you try.
The more you will look like a fool!
--- Unknown ---
This is not your problem.
You've not got the spine.
You are a teacher just go back to school!
--- Unknown ---
But this little girl...
This miracle...
She seems not to know
That she's special at all.
--- Unknown ---
And what sort of teacher would I be
If I let this little girl fall through the cracks I can see,
This little girl needs somebody strong
To fight by her side.
--- Unknown ---
Instead she's found me.
Pathetic little me!
And another door closes.
