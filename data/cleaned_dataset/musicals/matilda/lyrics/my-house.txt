------ My House ------
--- Unknown ---
(MISS HONEY)
--- Unknown ---
This roof keeps me dry when the rain falls.
This door helps to keep the cold at bay.
On this floor I can stand on my own two feet.
--- Unknown ---
On this chair I can write my lessons.
On this pillow I can dream my nights away.
And this table, as you can see, well, it's perfect for tea.
--- Unknown ---
It isn't much but it is enough for me.
It isn't much but it is enough...
--- Unknown ---
On these walls I hang wonderful pictures.
Through this window I can watch the seasons change.
By this lamp I can read, and I, I am set free!
--- Unknown ---
And when it's cold outside I feel no fear!
Even in the winter storms, I am warmed by a small but stubborn fire.
And there is no-where I would rather be.
--- Unknown ---
It isn't much but it is enough for me.
It isn't much but it is enough for me.
--- Unknown ---
For this is my house!
This is my house!
It isn't much but it is enough for me.
--- Unknown ---
This is my house!
This is my house!
It isn't much but it is enough.
--- Unknown ---
(MISS HONEY and (MATILDA and the ESCAPOLOGIST))
--- Unknown ---
(Don't cry ...)
And when it's cold and bleak
--- Unknown ---
(Please don't cry, I'm here! ... )
I feel no fear!
--- Unknown ---
Even in the fiercest storms!
--- Unknown ---
I am warmed
by a small but stubborn fire!
--- Unknown ---
(MISS HONEY and (the ESCAPOLOGIST))
--- Unknown ---
(Forgive me)
Even when outside it's freezing
I don't pay much heed.
--- Unknown ---
(I know that I hurt you)
I know that everything I need is in here.
--- Unknown ---
It isn't much but it is enough for me.
