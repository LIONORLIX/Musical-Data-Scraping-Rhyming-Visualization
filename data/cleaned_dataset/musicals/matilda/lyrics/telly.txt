Somewhere, on a show I heard
That a picture tells a thousand words
So telly if you bothered to take a look
Is the equivalent of like.....lots of books!
All i know I learnt from telly
This big beautiful box o' facts
If you know a thing already
Baby you can switch the channel over just like that!

Endless joy an endless laughter
Folks livin' 'appily ever after
All you need to make you wise
Is twenty-three minutes plus advertisements
Why would we waste our energy turnin' the pages 1, 2, 3
When we can sit comfortably on our lovely bufferlees
Watching people singing, and talking, and doing stuff
All I know I learnt from telly
The bigger the telly the smarter the man
You can tell from my big telly
Just how clever a feller I am

Take it away son

All i know I learnt from telly
What to think and what to buy
I was pretty smart already
But now I'm really really smart
Very very smart
--- Unknown ---
Endless content, endless channels
Endless chat on endless panels
All you need to fill your muffin
Without havin' to really think or nuffin
Why would we waste our energy
Trying to work out Ulysses
When we can sit happily on our lovely baferlees
Watching slightly famous people talking to really famous people!
