------ The World Above ------
--- Ariel ---
This is where I belong,
Beneath the clear wide blue here!
I feel completely new here in the world above!
It’s like my life was wrong
And somehow, now, at last I’m in
My own skin
Up here in the world above!
--- Unknown ---
There’s so much light here
Light and space!
The sun’s so bright here
Upon my face!
It feels so right here
Warm as love...
Life seems to be
Almost calling to me
