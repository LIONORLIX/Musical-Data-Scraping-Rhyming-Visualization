------ Part of Your World (Reprise) ------
--- ARIEL ---
Was I too late?
--- SCUTTLE ---
It's hard to say. . . Oh, I--I can't make out a heartbeat!
--- ARIEL ---
No, look! He's breathing. Oh, Scuttle. . . just look at him. He's so beautiful.
--- Unknown ---
What would I give
To live where you are?
What would I pay
To stay here beside you?
What would I do to see you
Smiling at me?
--- Unknown ---
Where would we walk?
Where would we run?
If we could stay all day in the sun?
Just you and me
And I could be
Part of your world
--- Unknown ---
I don't know when
I don't how
But I know something's starting right now
Watch and you'll see
Someday I'll be
Part of your world!
