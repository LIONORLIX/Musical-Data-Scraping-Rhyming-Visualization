------ Positoovity ------
--- SCUTTLE ---
What's this? You giving up so soon? You gotta have a little gumption. Yeah!
A can-do kinda attitude. Take it from a gull who knows
--- Unknown ---
(sung)
Now look at me
You see this face
In terms of beauty I'm a basket case
And as for style and savoir faire
Well I guess there ain’t
A whole lot there
Yup, although perhaps
It makes no sense
I strut my stuff
With lots of confidence
Cause though I lack
And awful lot
There is one thing I got!
I got positoovity!
I got positoovity!
It gives me the zam
And the zow
And the yaddle laddle laddle
That’s why I walk
With a wiggle in my waddle
Cause once you’ve heard that word
There aint nothing you can do
So let that positoovity
Work for you
--- SEBASTIAN ---
Positoovity? Why der's no such word.
--- SCUTTLE ---
Course there is in the dictionary right between popsuckle and prehysterical.
Believe you me I seen it work miracles!

Now he's a shmoe
--- SEAGULL ---
Yo!
--- SCUTTLE ---
And he's a shlep
--- SEAGULL ---
Yeah?
--- SCUTTLE ---
And this one doesn’t
got the sharpest rep
--- SEAGULL ---
Squawk?
--- SCUTTLE ---
In fact all three
without a doubt
missed the day that brains
were handed out
--- SEAGULL ---
But if he's no sage
--- SEAGULL ---
And he's no wiz
--- SEAGULLS ---
The whole world thinks
That we are geniuses
Cause all our screws
May be unscrewed
But dig our attitude
--- SCUTTLE AND SEAGULLS ---
We got positricity!
--- SCUTTLE ---
How 'bout you, huh?
--- SCUTTLE AND SEAGULLS ---
We got poositivity!
--- SCUTTLE ---
Just try it out, come on!
--- SEAGULL ---
It gives us the bing
--- SEAGULL ---
And the bang
--- SCUTTLE ---
And the yippee-dip-doodle
--- SCUTTLE AND SEAGULLS ---
That’s why we sounds
Like there's knowledge
In our noodle
And once you learned that word
There ain’t nothing you can do
So let that positricity
--- SCUTTLE ---
N-N-No, Positroocity!
--- SEAGULLS ---
Poositrocity
Work for you!
--- SEBASTIAN ---
Ariel, don't take advice from birdbrains.
--- SCUTTLE ---
Birdbrains! Who you callin' birdbrains!
We got natural talent, what i like to call Gull-ability!
--- SCUTTLE AND SEAGULLS ---
So with the vip and the vap
And the ba-ba boo
You can flip any flap
Till your wish comes true
The tip is the tap
Into something that you believe
--- SCUTTLE ---
Cause with the zig and the zug
And the zig-zug-zing
There aint nothing you cant be
You see its really your prerogative
--- SCUTTLE AND SEAGULLS ---
You simply cant think nogative
--- SCUTTLE ---
Then there’s you just sitting there
Smack down flat upon your dairy air, Hey!
If that's the way you wanna be
Well you might as well be shrubbery
So stand right up, and dust your seat
And walk real tall upon
Your own two feet
And sure you’ll trip
And make mistakes
But you’ve got what it takes!
--- Unknown ---
(tap break)
--- SEAGULL ---
You go, gull!
--- SCUTTLE AND SEAGULLS ---
And now you know that word
There ain’t nothing you cant do
--- SCUTTLE ---
So go get some posilicity
You can bet on positricity
And just let that positrinity
No, positroonity. Poositomity?
Is it? Pardon, what is it!
--- SEAGULLS ---
Positoovity!
--- SCUTTLE AND SEAGULLS ---
Positively work for
