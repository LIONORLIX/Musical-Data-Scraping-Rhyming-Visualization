------ The World Above (Triton Reprise) ------
--- KING TRITON ---
This is where you belong!
--- ARIEL ---
You don’t understand!
--- KING TRITON ---
For once, just listen, will you?
That savage brute would kill you in the world above!
--- ARIEL ---
He’s not a barbarian—
--- KING TRITON ---
Don’t try that same old song!
I’ll have you grounded ‘til next year!
Am I clear?
Don’t go near that world above!
--- ARIEL ---
I’m not a child anymore!
--- KING TRITON ---
No? Have you lost your senses? He’s a human; you’re a mermaid.
--- ARIEL ---
It doesn’t matter!
--- KING TRITON ---
I’m still the king here – my word is law!
This filth you bring here is the final straw
And push, my daughter, has come to shove!
I’ll make you obey
‘Til you do as I say
I don’t care, come what may
But I’ll keep you away
