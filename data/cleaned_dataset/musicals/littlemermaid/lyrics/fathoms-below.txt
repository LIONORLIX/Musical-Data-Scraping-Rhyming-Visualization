------ Fathoms Below ------
--- PILOT ---
I'll tell you a tale of the bottomless blue
--- SAILORS ---
An' it's hey to the starboard, heave ho!
Brave sailor, beware, 'cause a big 'uns a-brewin'
--- SAILORS ---
Mysterious fathoms below!
Heave ho!
--- PILOT ---
I'll sing you a song of the king of the sea
--- PILOT & SAILORS ---
An' it's hey to the starboard, heave ho!
--- PILOT ---
The ruler of all of the oceans is he
--- SAILORS ---
In mysterious fathoms below!
Fathoms below, below!
From whence wayward westerlies blow!
Where Triton is king
And his merpeople sing
In mysterious fathoms below!
--- PRINCE ERIC ---
Isn't this perfection, Grimsby? Out on the open sea, surrounded by nothing but water
--- GRIMSBY ---
Oh, yes, it’s simply...delightful...
--- PRINCE ERIC ---
The salt on your skin
And the wind in your hair
And the waves as they ebb and they flow!
We’re miles from the shore
And guess what – I don’t care!
--- GRIMSBY ---
As for me, I’m about to heave ho!
--- PILOT ---
Back to work!
--- SAILORS ---
I’ll sing you a song of the king of the sea
An’ it’s hey to the starboard, heave ho!
The ruler of all of the oceans is he
In mysterious fathoms below!
--- GRIMSBY ---
King of the sea? Why, that’s nautical nonsense – nothing but a superstition!
--- PILOT ---
The king of the ocean gets angry
An’ when he gets angry, beware!
I’m tellin’ ya, lad, when King Triton is mad
How the waves’ll buck, rock to and fro!
--- PILOT & SAILORS ---
Hold on, good luck, as down you go!
--- PRINCE ERIC ---
What is that? Do you hear something?
--- GRIMSBY ---
Milord, please. Enough sea-faring! You’ve got to get back to court –
to honor your father’s dying wish and
take up his crown!
--- PRINCE ERIC ---
That’s not the life for me, Grimsby—
There it is again!
--- PILOT ---
We ought to head back to shore, your majesty.
--- GRIMSBY ---
Indeed, we should!
--- PRINCE ERIC ---
Not while I’m captain. Now follow that voice! To the ends of the earth if we have to!
--- PILOT ---
Aye-aye, Captain!
--- PILOT & SAILORS ---
There’s mermaids out there in the bottomless blue
An’ it’s hey to the starboard, heave ho!
Watch out for ‘em, lad, or you’ll go to your ruin
