------ Her Voice ------
--- PRINCE ERIC ---
Where did she go?
Where can she be?
When will she come again
Calling to me?
Calling to me...
Calling to me...
--- Unknown ---
Somewhere there's a girl
Who's like the shimmer of the wind upon the water
somewhere there's a girl
Who's like the glimmer of the sunlight on the sea
Somewhere there's a girl
Who's like a swell of endless music
Somewhere she is singing
And her song is meant for me
--- Unknown ---
And her voice
It's sweet as angels sighing
And her voice
It's warm as summer sky
And that sound
It haunts my dreams
And spins me 'round
Until it seems
I'm flying...
Her voice!
--- Unknown ---
I can sense her laughter
In the ripple of the waves against the shoreline
I can see her smiling
In the moonlight as it settles on the sand
I can feel her waiting
Just beyond the pale horizon
Singing out a melody too lovely to withstand
--- Unknown ---
And her voice
It's there as dusk is falling
And her voice
It's there as dawn steals by
Pure and bright, it's always near
All day, all night
And still I hear it calling...
Her voice
--- Unknown ---
Strange as a dream...
Real as the sea...
If you can hear me now
Come set me free...
