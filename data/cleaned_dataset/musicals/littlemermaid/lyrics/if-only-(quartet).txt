------ If Only (Quartet) ------
--- Ariel ---
If only you could know
The things I long to say
If only I could tell you
What I wish I could convey
It's in my ev'ry glance
My heart's an open book
You'd see it all at once
If only you would look
--- Unknown ---
If only you could glimpse
The feeling that I feel
If only you would notice
What I'm dying to reveal
The dreams I can't declare
The needs I can't deny
You'd understand them all
If only you would try
--- Unknown ---
All my secrets, you would learn them
All my longings, you'd return them
Then the silence would be broken
Not a word would need be spoken
--- Prince Eric ---
What is it about her
That's so wonderfully, impossibly familiar?
Why do I feel dizzy
In a way I've only felt but once before?
How come when she looks at me
It seems like time stops moving
Almost like the way it did that day upon the shore?
But that voice!
--- Ariel ---
If only it were true
If only for a while
--- Eric ---
Ah, that voice!
--- Ariel ---
If only you would notice
How I ache beneath my smile
--- Eric ---
Where's that voice?
--- Ariel ---
I guess you never will
I guess it doesn't show
But if I never find a way to tell you so
Oh, what I would give
If only you could know
--- Sebastian ---
(Spoken)Bless ya, child. Tomorrow, the Prince will have his pick of any princess in the land! How can a little mermaid
compete with that?
--- Unknown ---
If only I knew how
I'd make him see the light
If only it were up to me
This all would turn out right
And if I only could
I'll tell you what I'd do
I'd simply wave my claw
And make your dreams come true
And wouldn't that surprise you
If you only knew
--- King Triton ---
How could she just suddenly
Completely disappear into thin water?
It's been two whole days
And I don't know where she has gone!
--- Eric ---
Ah, that voice!
--- King Triton ---
If only you'd come home...
--- Sebastian ---
If only I could help...
--- Eric ---
Where's that voice?
--- Ariel ---
If only there were time
I know we'd kiss at last
--- Eric ---
That voice!
--- King Triton ---
If only you'd come back
I'll change my ways!
--- Sebastian ---
Just one more day for that kiss to come...
--- Ariel ---
But time keeps racing forward
And our moment's almost passed!
--- King Triton ---
I'll try to understand...
--- Ariel ---
It has to happen now...
--- King Triton ---
I'll keep my temper low...
--- Sebastian ---
I'd give my life up to make it happen...
--- King Triton ---
I should have started listening to you all along...
--- Eric ---
How I wish that girl could have been this one!
--- Ariel ---
There's only one more day until I have to go!
--- Eric ---
If only...
--- Ariel, Sebastian & King Triton ---
Oh, what I would give if only you could know...
--- Eric ---
And at the ball
What will occur?
Maybe I'll find that voice
But I'll lose her...
--- Ariel ---
If only...
--- Sebastian ---
If only...
--- King Triton ---
