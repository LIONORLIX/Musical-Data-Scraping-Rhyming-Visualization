------ Beyond My Wildest Dreams ------
--- ARIEL ---
Oh! Just look!
It's like I'm in a storybook!
Oh! It's bliss!
I dreamed that it would be
Somewhat-
But not
Like this!
--- Unknown ---
Look over there!
Oh my god!
How very odd!
And what might they be?
Something splendid, maybe!
--- Unknown ---
Look over here!
Could you bust?
Isn't it just
Bedazzling, dazing
Utterly amazing!
Gazing 'round, it's like, to die!
Just seeing it feels so good
I'd scream if I only could!
--- Unknown ---
I'd hoped and wished
And wanted so to be here
Wished and prayed
And planned it to a t
Prayed and wow!
Just look - it's really me here!
Walking around, strange as it seems
Somewhere beyond my wildest dreams!
--- Unknown ---
MAID 1
Look at her there
Looking 'round
Won't make a sound
--- Unknown ---
MAID 2
Just keeps on gawking-
Weird how she's not talking!
--- Unknown ---
MAID 3
Look at her stare
--- Unknown ---
MAID 4
Lucky miss!
--- Unknown ---
MAID 3
Chosen like this
To stay for dinner
--- Unknown ---
MAID 4
What does he see in her?
--- CARLOTTA ---
Hush now, girls - she's simply shy!
--- MAIDS ---
Hmmph!
--- Unknown ---
MAIDS 3 & 4
Just picture the table chat!
--- Unknown ---
MAIDS 1 & 2
One sided, if even that!
--- ARIEL ---
I'd hoped and wished
And wondered what I'd do here
Wished and prayed
And pictured what I'd see
Prayed and wow!
--- Unknown ---
My prayers are coming true here!
Look at it all, look how it gleams!
Lovely beyond my wildest dreams...
--- Unknown ---
Look - it's him!
SO handsome and refined and slim
Sweet, sincere
Magnificent from head to toe
And oh...
--- Unknown ---
I'd hoped and wished
My life would feel enchanted!
Wished and prayed
The fates would hear my plea
Prayed and wow!
MY prayers are more than granted!
Look at it all, hall after hall
Perfect as you could please here!
Marvels galore, and even more
Gee, did I mention *he's* here?
And if - who knows? - all of it goes
Past even these extremes
Just look at me and you will see
