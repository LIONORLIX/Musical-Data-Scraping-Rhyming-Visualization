(spoken)
Ariel, listen to me
The human world, it's a mess
Life under the sea is better than anything they got up there
--- Unknown ---
(sung)
The seaweed is always greener
In someone else's lake
You dream about going up there
But that is a big mistake
Just look at the world around you
Right here on the ocean floor
Such wonderful things surround you
What more is you looking for?
--- Unknown ---
Under the sea, under the sea
Darling its better down where its wetter
Take it from me
Up on the shore they work all day
Out in the sun they slave away
While we're devoting full time to floating
Under the sea
--- Unknown ---
Down here all the fish is happy
As after the waves they roll
The fish on the land ain't happy
They sad cause they're in the bowl
The fish in the bowl is lucky
They're in for a worser fate
One day when the boss get hungry
Guess who goin' be on the plate?
--- Unknown ---
Wo-no, under the sea
Under the sea
Nobody beat us, fry us and eat us
In fricassee
We what the land folks loves to cook
Under the sea we off the hook
We've got no troubles, life is the bubbles
--- Unknown ---
Under the sea
Under the sea
Since life is sweet here, we got the beat here
Naturally (Under the sea)
Even the sturgeon and the ray
They get the urge and start to play
We've got the spirit, you've got to hear it
Under the sea
--- Unknown ---
The lute play the flute
The carp play the harp
The plaice play the bass and they soundin' sharp
The bass play the brass
The chub play the tub
The fluke is the duke of soul (yeah)
The ray, he can play the lings on the strings
The trout acting out
The blackfish she sings
The smelt and the sprat
They know where it's at
And oh, that blowfish blow!

(instrumental)

Ah, under the sea (under the sea)
Under the sea (under the sea)
When the sardine begin the beguine
It's music to me
What do they got, a lot of sand?
We've got a hot crustacean band
Each little clam here know how to jam here
Under the sea
Each little slug here cutting a rug here
Under the sea
Each little snail here know how to wail here
That's why it's hotter under the water
Yeah, we in luck here down under the muck here
Under the sea
