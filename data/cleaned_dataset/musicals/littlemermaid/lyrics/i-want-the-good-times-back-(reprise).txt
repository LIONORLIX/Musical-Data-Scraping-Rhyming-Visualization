------ I Want The Good Times Back (Reprise) ------
--- URSULA ---
She didn't waste much time
The little shameless tease
One sunsetâ€™s barely through
And Princey-Poo is on his knees
They'll be smooching by day two, boys
If she keeps it up like this
So there's just one thing to do, boys
--- FLOTSAM AND JETSAM ---
What?
--- URSULA ---
Go up and block that kiss!
--- JETSAM ---
Oh!
--- URSULA ---
Meanwhile
I bet her Daddy's worried bad
And wondering where she's been
--- ALL ---
Soon he'll guess
And then, oh yes!
The real fun can begin!
--- URSULA ---
Onward and upwards my live wires!
And stop that lip lock!
--- FLOTSAM AND JETSAM ---
Yes, your wretchedness!
--- URSULA ---
So let the clock run out
Their time is almost up
And once they're trapped
I'll have them wrapped
Around my suction cup
With my tentacles around them
I'll at last be back on track
And headed for good times
Deliciously good times
Two days!
And the good times
------ fin ------
