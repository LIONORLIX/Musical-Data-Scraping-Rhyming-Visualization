------ Les Poissons ------

Les poissons, les poissons
How I love les poissons
Love to chop and to serve little fish
First I cut off their heads
Then I pull out their bones
Ah mes oui,
Ã‡a c'est toujours delish
--- Unknown ---
Les poissons, les poissons
Hee-hee-hee, haw-haw-haw
With the cleaver I hack them in two
I pull out what's inside
And I serve it up fried
God, I love little fishes, don't you?
--- Unknown ---
Here's something for tempting the palette
Prepared in the classic technique
First you pound the fish flat with a mallet
Then you slash through the skin
Give the belly a slice
Then you rub some salt in
'Cause it makes it taste nice
--- Unknown ---
Zut alors!  I have missed one!  Shh. . .
--- Unknown ---
Sacre bleu!  What is this?
How on earth could I miss
Such a sweet little succulent crab?
Quel domage!  What a loss!
You belong in the sauce
With some flour, I think, just a dab
--- Unknown ---
Then I'll stuff you with bread
It won't hurt--you'll be dead
And you'll surely be lucky you are
Cause its gonna be hot
In my big copper pot
