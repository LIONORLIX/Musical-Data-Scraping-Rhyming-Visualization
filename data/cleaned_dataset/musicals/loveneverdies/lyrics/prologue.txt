Madame Giry: His dream, our dream!

Fleck: Remember how it was? Remember. (Singing) Coney Isle, glistening and glimmering rising bright, drenched with light see
it smile beckoning and shimmering all a gleam, like a dream every fantasy set free, sudden rising by the sea,

Madame Giry: (Singing) Coney Isle, miracle on miracle, light and sound, all around, mile by mile loud and loud and lyrical.
Thrill, on thrill, never still. All america was there. Begger next to billionaire. In they came chasing sensation and
romance. Eyes aflame, desperate for pleasures yet unknown. Night and day, coming in by the hundred of thousands. Swept away
by their every desire made real! (Scream is heard)
