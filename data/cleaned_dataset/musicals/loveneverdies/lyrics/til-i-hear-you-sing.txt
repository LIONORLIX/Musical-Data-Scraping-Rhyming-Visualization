------ Til I Hear You Sing ------
--- Unknown ---
The day starts, the day ends
Time crawls by
Night steals in, pacing the floor
The moments creep,
Yet I can?t bear to sleep
Till I hear you sing
--- Unknown ---
And weeks pass, and months pass
Seasons fly
Still you don?t walk through the door
And in a haze
I count the silent days
Till I hear you sing once more.
--- Unknown ---
And sometimes at night time
I dream that you are there
But wake holding nothing but the empty air
--- Unknown ---
And years come, and years go
Time runs dry
Still I ache down to the core
My broken soul
Can?t be alive and whole
Till I hear you sing once more
--- Unknown ---
And music, your music
It teases at my ear
I turn and it fades away and you?re not here
--- Unknown ---
Let hopes pass, let dreams pass
Let them die
Without you, what are they for?
I?ll always feel
No more than halfway real
Till I hear you sing once more
