------ Mother, did you watch? ------
--- Meg ---
Mother did you watch
Everything is sold
Mother can't you tell
The new routine, it went so well
--- Unknown ---
I was worried just a touch
That it might have been too much
Just a bit, well, rather free
--- Unknown ---
But just listen to the crowd
Why they've never been so loud
Screaming only for me.
--- Unknown ---
Madame Giry: Meg-
--- Meg ---
And the Master must have heard
Every note and every word
Mother, tell me, did he see?
--- Unknown ---
Madame Giry: Meg, stop it-
--- Meg ---
Even he will now concede
I'm the only one he'll need.
Mother what's wrong?
--- Madame ---
Meg, sweet fool, you did all that you could
Charming, bright and yet still not enough
--- Unknown ---
Meg: What? What do you mean?
--- Madame Giry ---
How you danced
They're all entranced
Yes
All but the one whose entrancement we sought
--- Unknown ---
Meg: He wasn't there?
--- Madame Giry ---
Where poor girl, do you think that he was?
Yes, that's right, in with her all along
--- Unknown ---
Meg: With Christine?
--- Madame Giry ---
Dreaming of their child, they're love
Too smitten to give you one moment of thought-
--- Unknown ---
Meg: But you said-
--- Madame Giry ---
All that you gave him, it's all been a waste-
--- Unknown ---
Meg: You're wrong!
--- Madame Giry ---
All that you've done it has all been erased
--- Unknown ---
Meg: Don't say that!
--- Madame Giry ---
Now he has them,
As for us,
We have both been replaced
