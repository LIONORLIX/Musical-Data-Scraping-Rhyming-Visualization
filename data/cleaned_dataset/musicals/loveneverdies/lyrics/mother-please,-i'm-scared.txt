Gustave
Mother, please, I'm scared!
What a dream! An awful dream!
Someone strange and mad,
Seizing me and drowning me!

Christine
Shh, Gustave.
It's all right.
Come and meet a friend of mine.
--- Unknown ---
Phantom
Welcome to my world, my friend.

Christine
Gustave, this is Mister Y.
--- Unknown ---
Gustave
This place is yours?
--- Unknown ---
Phantom
Every inch of it.
Tell me where you'd like to go.
Tell me what you want to see
I can grant any wish...
--- Unknown ---
Gustave
Could you show me,
If you please,
All the islands mysteries?
All that's strange and wild and dark
In the shadows of the park?
--- Unknown ---
Phantom
You shall see it all tomorrow.
I promise.
--- Unknown ---
Christine
Back to sleep now, Gustave.
--- Unknown ---
Gustave
Yes, mother.
