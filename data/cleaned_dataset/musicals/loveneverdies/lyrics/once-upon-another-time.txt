------ Once Upon Another Time ------
--- Christine ---
Once upon another time, our story had only begun
You chose to turn the page, and I made choices too
--- Unknown ---
Once upon that other time, we did what we thought must be done
And now we have no choice, we do what we must do
--- Unknown ---
We love, we live, we give what we give
And take what little we deserve
--- Phantom ---
Once upon another time, I knew how our story would end
And maybe I was wrong, but now the moment's gone
Were it still that other time, I'd make time itself somehow bend
But now I'm not that strong, and time keeps moving on
--- Christine and Phantom ---
We love, we live, we give what we can give
And take what little we deserve
We love, we live, we give what we can give
And take what little we deserve
Once upon another time
