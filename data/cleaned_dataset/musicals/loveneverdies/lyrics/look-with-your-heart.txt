------ Look With Your Heart ------
--- Christine ---
Love's a curious thing, it often comes disguised
Look at love the wrong way, it goes unrecognized
--- Unknown ---
So look with your heart, and not with your eyes
The heart understands, the heart never lies
Believe what it feels, and trust what it shows
Look with your heart, the heart always knows
Love is not always beautiful, not at the start
--- Unknown ---
So open your arms, and close your eyes tight
Look with your heart, and when it finds love, your heart will be right
--- Unknown ---
Learn from someone who knows, make sure you don't forget
Love you misunderstand is love that you'll regret
--- Gustave ---
Mother?
Look with your heart, and not with your eyes
The heart can't be fooled
--- Christine ---
The heart is too wise
--- Gustave ---
Forget what you think
--- Christine ---
Ignore what you hear
--- Christine and Gustave ---
Look with your heart, it always sees clear
--- Gustave ---
Love is not always beautiful, not at the start
--- Christine ---
But open your arms, and close your eyes tight
