------ Beneath A Moonless Sky ------
--- Christine ---
I should have know that you'd be here, I should have known it all along
This whole arrangement bears your stamp; you're in each measure of that song
How dare you try and claim me now? How dare you come invade my life?
--- Phantom ---
Oh Christine, my Christine, in that time when the world thought me dead
My Christine, on that night just before you wed, ah Christine
You came and found where I hid, don't you deny that you did, that long ago night
--- Christine ---
That night...
--- Phantom ---
Once there was a night beneath a moonless sky
Too dark to see a thing, too dark to even try
--- Christine ---
I strode to your side, to tell you I must go
I couldn't see your face, but sensed you even so
And I touched you
--- Phantom ---
And I felt you
--- Phantom and Christine ---
And I heard those ravishing refrains
--- Christine ---
The music of your pulse
--- Phantom ---
The singing in your veins
--- Christine ---
And I held you
--- The Phantom ---
And I touched you
--- Christine ---
And embraced you
--- Phantom ---
And I felt you
--- The Phantom and Christine ---
And with every breath and every sigh
--- Christine ---
I felt no longer scared
--- Phantom ---
I felt no longer shy
--- Phantom and Christine ---
At last our feelings bared
Beneath a moonless sky
--- Christine ---
And blind in the dark, as soul gazed into soul;
I looked into your heart and saw you pure and whole
--- Phantom ---
Cloaked under the night, with nothing to suppress
A woman and a man, no more and yet no less
And I kissed you
--- Christine ---
And caressed you
--- Unknown ---
The Phantom and Christine: And the world around us fell away
We said things in the dark, we never dare to say
--- The Phantom ---
And I caught you
--- Christine ---
And I kissed you
--- Phantom ---
And I took you
--- Christine ---
And caressed you
--- Phantom and Christine ---
With a need too urgent to deny
As nothing mattered then, except for you and I
Again and then again, beneath a moonless sky
--- Phantom ---
And when it was done, before the sun could rise
Ashamed of what I was, afraid to see your eyes
I stood while you slept and whispered a good-bye
And slipped into the dark beneath a moonless sky
--- Christine ---
And I loved you, yes, I loved you
I'd have followed anywhere you led
I woke to swear my love, and found you gone instead
--- The Phantom ---
And I loved you
--- Christine ---
I loved you
--- Phantom ---
And I left you
--- Christine ---
How I loved you
--- Phantom ---
And I had to, both of us knew why
--- Christine ---
We both knew why
--- Phantom and Christine ---
And yet I won't regret from now until I die
A night I can't forget beneath a moonless sky
--- Phantom ---
And now...
--- Christine ---
