------ Broadway Rhythm ------
--- Don ---
Don't bring a frown to old Broadway
Ah, you got a clown on Broadway
Your troubles there, they're out of style
'Cause Broadway always wears a smile.
A million lights, they flicker there
A million hearts beat quicker there
No skies are gray on that great white way,
That's the Broadway Melody!

Gotta dance!
Gotta dance!
Gotta dance!
--- Don and Chorus ---
Gotta dance!
Gotta dance!
Gotta dance!
--- Don ---
Broadway rhythm's got me, ev'rybody dance.
Broadway rhythm's got me, ev'rybody dance.
Out on the gay white way and each merry caf?
Orchestras play taking our breath away,
Broadway rhythm's got me, ev'rybody sing and dance.
Oh, that Broadway rhythm...
Oh, that Broadway rhythm.
When I hear that happy beat
I feel like dancin' down the street
In that Broadway rhythm writhing, beating rhythm...
