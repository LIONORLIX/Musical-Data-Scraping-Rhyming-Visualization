------ Would You? ------
--- Kathy ---
He holds her in his arms,
would you, would you?
He tells her of her charms,
would you, would you?
They met as you and I and they were only friends,
But before
--- Kathy & Lina ---
the story ends,
He?ll kiss her with a sigh, would you,
--- Kathy ---
would you?
And if the girl were I would you, would you
And would you dare to say let?s do the same as they,
I would, would you?
And would you dare to say let?s do the same as they,
I would, would you?
