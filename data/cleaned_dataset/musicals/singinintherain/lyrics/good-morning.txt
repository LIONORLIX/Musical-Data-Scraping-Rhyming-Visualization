Good mornin',
Cosmo:
Good mornin'!
Don:
We've talked the whole night through,
Kathy:
Good mornin'
Kathy, Don & Cosmo:
Good mornin' to you.
Good mornin', good mornin'!
It's great to stay up late,
Good mornin', good mornin' to you.
Cosmo:
When the band began to play
The sun was shinin' bright.
Don:
Now the milkman's on his way,
It's too late to say goodnight.
Kathy, Don & Cosmo:
So, good mornin', good mornin'!
Sunbeams will soon smile through,
Good mornin', good mornin', to you,
Kathy:
And you, and you, and you!
Good morning,
Good morning,
We've gabbed the whole night through.
Good morning, good morning to you.
Don & Cosmo:
Nothin' could be grander than to be in Louisiana
Kathy, Don & Cosmo:
In the morning,
In the morning,
It's great to stay up late!
Good mornin',
Good mornin' to you.
Don & Cosmo:
It might be just a zippy
If you was in Mississipi!
Kathy:
When we left the movie show
The future wasn't bright
But tame is gone
The show goes on
And I don't wanna say good night
Don & Cosmo:
So say, Good Mornin'!
Kathy:
Good Mornin'!
Kathy, Don & Cosmo:
Rainbow is shining through
Kathy:
Good Mornin'!
Don & Cosmo:
Good Mornin'!
Kathy:
Bon Jour!
Don & Cosmo:
Bon Jour!
Kathy:
Buenos Dias!
Don & Cosmo:
Buenos Dias!
Kathy:
Buon Giorno!

Buon Giorno!
