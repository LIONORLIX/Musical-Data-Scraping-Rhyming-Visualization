For a romance
What's wrong with me?

Whoat's wrong with me?
how come I don't thrill him?
He doesn't feel
My sex appeal

Maybe I'm much too exciting
At dinner he don't even flirt
I know I'm truely inviting
So why don't he stay for dessert?
--- Unknown ---
He asked me out in the moonlight
To linger and to roam
I thought he'd take me in his arms
But he just tooke me home
--- Unknown ---
What's wrong with him?
He's lost his Libido
I got the urge
So why don't he splurge
What's wrong with him?
--- Unknown ---
What's wrong with him?
We should be out dancing
I'm hot to trot
He'd rather not
What's wrong with him?

There's things more important than diction
So a girl can't say CAHN'T
I said it!
Why is he causing such friction
When he could be Mr. Lamont?!
--- Unknown ---
What's wrong with me?
Why all this confusion
I'm quite a girl
A real cultured pearl
What's wrong with me?
--- Unknown ---
I ain't so dumb!
This peach ain't a plum!
What' wrong with him?
Tell me what's wrong with me?!
NOTHIN'!!!!
