------ All I Do Is Dream of You ------
--- Kathy and Girls ---
All I do is dream of you
The whole night through
With the dawn, I still go on
And dream of you
You're every thought
You're everything
You're every song I ever sing
Summer, winter, autumn and spring.
--- Unknown ---
And were there more
Than twenty-four hours a day,
They'd be spent in sweet content
Dreamin' away
--- Unknown ---
When skies are gray
When skies are blue
Morning, noon and nighttime too
All I do the whole day through
Is dream of you
All I do the whole day throughIs dream of you.
--- Unknown ---
It's cat's meow!
--- Unknown ---
All I do the whole day through
