------ How Deep Is The Ocean? ------
--- Verse: ---
How can I tell you what is in my heart?
How can I measure each and every part?
How can I tell you how much I love you?
How can I measure just how much I do?
--- Refrain: ---
How much do I love you? I'll tell you no lie
How deep is the ocean? How high is the sky?
--- Unknown ---
How many times a day do I think of you?
How many roses are sprinkled with dew?
--- Unknown ---
How far would I travel to be where you are?
How far is the journey from here to a star?
--- Unknown ---
And if I ever lost you, how much would I cry?
