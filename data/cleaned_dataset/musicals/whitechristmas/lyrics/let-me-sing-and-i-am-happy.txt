------ Let Me Sing and I AM Happy ------
--- Verse: ---
What care I who makes the laws of a nation
Let those who will take care of its rights and wrongs
What care I who cares for the world's affairs
As long as I can sing its popular songs
--- Refrain: ---
Let me sing a funny song
With crazy words that roll along
And if my song can start you laughing
I'm happy, happy
--- Unknown ---
Let me sing a sad refrain
Of broken hearts who love in vain
And if my song can start you crying
I'm happy
--- Unknown ---
Let me croon a lowdown blues
That lifts you out of your seat
If my blues can reach your shoes
And start you tapping your feet
I'm happy
--- Unknown ---
Let me sing of Dixie's charms
Of cotton fields and mammy's arms
And if my song can make you homesick
I'm happy
--- Various alternate lines: ---
--- Unknown ---
Of broken hearts that loved in vain
--- Unknown ---
To lift you out of your seat
If my song can reach your shoes
