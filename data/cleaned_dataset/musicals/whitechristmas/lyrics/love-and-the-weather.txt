------ Love and the Weather ------
--- Verse: ---
Unpredictable, irresponsible
Unbelievable, unreliable
Ever since the world began
Are Cupid and the weather man
--- Refrain: ---
Love and the weather, birds of a feather
Can't be depended upon
One day it's sunny, next day the sunshine has gone
--- Unknown ---
Love and the weather, always together
Planning another surprise
Bringing the raindrops just like the tears to your eyes
--- Unknown ---
There was I with love close by
So cozy and warm
Love walked out and so did I
Right out of the warm
Into a storm
--- Unknown ---
Moonlight romances have to take chances
That's what I learned with the dawn
Love and the weather can't be depended upon
--- Alternate Final Strain: ---
Moonlight advances, love's golden chances
Rain comes along and they're gone
