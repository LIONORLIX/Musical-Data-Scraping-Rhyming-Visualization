------ Falling Out of Love ------
--- Verse: ---
Crocodile tears will not be shed
They're not for a lady like I'm
I can recall what my aunt said
When she married for the twentieth time
--- 1st refrain: ---
Falling out of love can be fun
After love is over and done
It's an awful blow and although it's upsetting
So much you can do while you're forgetting
Falling out of love can be fun
--- Unknown ---
When you've find your lover has gone
Get your second wind and go on
There's an old affair that is there for renewing
In your grief, do you know what you're doing?
Falling out of love can be fun
--- Unknown ---
Soon, you'll be swinging in a hammock on a porch
One arm wrapped around someone else
The other arm carrying a torch
--- Unknown ---
Love can give a lady a clout
And she may be down but not out
Get yourself a date, don't you wait for the count of ten, then
Falling out of love can be falling in love again
--- 2nd refrain: ---
Falling out of love can be fun
Someone else can soon be the one
By another name, he's the same as his brother
Close your eyes and one is like the other
Falling out of love can be fun
--- Unknown ---
When he goes before you have wed
And the stork is over your head
Soon you're gonna be with a she or a laddie
Smile as you go shopping for a daddy
Falling out of love can be fun
--- Unknown ---
Soon, you'll be losing all your troubles and your fears
One eye winking at someone else
The other eye filling up with tears
--- Unknown ---
When you find your lovin' romance
Gets a sudden kick in the pants
Get yourself surrounded and bounded with lots of men, then
