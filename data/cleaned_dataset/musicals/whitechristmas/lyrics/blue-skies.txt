------ Blue Skies ------
--- 1st verse: ---
I was blue, just as blue as I could be
Ev'ry day was a cloudy day for me
Then good luck came a-knocking at my door
Skies were gray but they're not gray anymore
--- Refrain: ---
Blue skies smiling at me
Nothing but blue skies do I see
--- Unknown ---
Bluebirds singing a song
Nothing but bluebirds all day long
--- Unknown ---
Never saw the sun shining so bright
Never saw things going so right
Noticing the days hurrying by
When you're in love, my how they fly
--- Unknown ---
Blue days, all of them gone
Nothing but blue skies from now on
--- 2nd verse: ---
I should care if the wind blows east or west
I should fret if the worst looks like the best
I should mind if they say it can't be true
