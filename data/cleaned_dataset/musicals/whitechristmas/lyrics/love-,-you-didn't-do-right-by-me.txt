------ Love , You didn't Do Right By Me ------
--- Unknown ---
Love, you didn't do right by me
You planned a romance that just hadn't a chance
And I'm through
--- Unknown ---
Love, you didn't do right by me
I'm back on the shelf and I'm blaming myself
But it's you
--- Unknown ---
My one love affair didn't get anywhere from the start
To send me a Joe who had winter and snow in his heart
Wasn't smart
--- Unknown ---
Love, you didn't do right by me
As they say in the song
You done me wrong!
