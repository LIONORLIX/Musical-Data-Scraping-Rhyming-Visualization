------ We'll Follow the Old Man ------
--- Unknown ---
We'll follow the old man wherever he wants to go
Long as he wants to go opposite to the foe
--- Unknown ---
We'll stay with the old man wherever he wants to stay
Long as he stays away from the battle's fray
--- Unknown ---
Because we love him, we love him
Especially when he keeps us on the ball
--- Unknown ---
And we'll tell the kiddies we answered duty's call
