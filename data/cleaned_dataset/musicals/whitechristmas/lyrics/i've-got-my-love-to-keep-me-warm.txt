------ I've Got My Love to Keep Me Warm ------
--- Unknown ---
The snow is snowing, the wind is blowing
But I can weather the storm
What do I care how much it may storm?
I've got my love to keep me warm
--- Unknown ---
I can't remember a worse December
Just watch those icicles form
What do I care if icicles form?
I've got my love to keep me warm
--- Unknown ---
Off with my overcoat
Off with my glove
I need no overcoat
I'm burning with love
--- Unknown ---
My heart's on fire, the flame grows higher
So I will weather the storm
What do I care how much it may storm?
