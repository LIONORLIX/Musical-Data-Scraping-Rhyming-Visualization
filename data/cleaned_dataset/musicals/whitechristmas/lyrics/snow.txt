Snow, it won't be long before we'll all be there with snow
Snow, I want to wash my hands, my face and hair with snow
--- Unknown ---
Snow, I long to clear a path and lift a spade of snow
Snow, oh, to see a great big man entirely made of snow
--- Unknown ---
Where it's snowing

That's where I want to be
Snowball throwing
That's what I'll do
How I'm longing to ski
Through the
--- Unknown ---
Snow, those glist'ning houses that seem to be built of snow
Snow, oh, to see a mountain covered with a quilt of snow
--- Unknown ---

No white Christmas with no snow
Snow
--- Unknown ---
I'll soon be there with snow
I'll wash my hair with snow
And with a spade of snow
I'll build a man that's made of snow
I'd love to stay up with you but I recommend a little shuteye
Go to sleep
And dream
