------ I Love A Piano ------
--- 1st verse: ---
As a child I went wild when a band played
How I ran to the man when his hand swayed
Clarinets were my pets, and a slide trombone I thought was simply divine
But today when they play I could hiss them
Ev'ry bar is a jar to my system
But there's one musical instrument that I call mine
--- Refrain: ---
I love a piano, I love a piano
I love to hear somebody play
Upon a piano, a grand piano
It simply carries me away
--- Unknown ---
I know a fine way to treat a Steinway
I love to run my fingers o'er the keys, the ivories
--- Unknown ---
And with the pedal I love to meddle
When Padarewski comes this way
I'm so delighted if I'm invited
To hear that long haired genius play
--- Unknown ---
So you can keep your fiddle and your bow
Give me a P-I-A-N-O, oh, oh
I love to stop right beside an upright
Or a high toned Baby Grand
--- 2nd verse: ---
When a green Tetrazine starts to warble
I grow cold as an old piece of marble
I allude to the crude little party singer who don't know when to pause
At her best I detest the soprano
But I run to the one at the piano
I always love the accomp'niment and that's because
--- Alternate lines: ---
Not only music from Broadway
I'm so delighted if I'm invited
