Sisters
Sisters
Sisters
There were never such devoted sisters
--- Unknown ---
Never had to have a chaperone "No, sir"
I'm there to keep my eye on her
--- Unknown ---
Caring
Sharing
Every little thing that we are wearing
--- Unknown ---
When a certain gentleman arrived from Rome
She wore the dress and I stayed home
--- Unknown ---
All kinds of weather
We stick together
The same in the rain or sun
Two diff'rent faces
But in tight places
We think and we act as one
--- Unknown ---
Those who've
Seen us
Know that not a thing could come between us
--- Unknown ---
Many men have tried to split us up but no one can
Lord help the mister
Who comes between me and my sister
And Lord help the sister
