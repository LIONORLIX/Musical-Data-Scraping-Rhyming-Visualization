------ Night on the Town ------
--- Unknown ---
Let?s go stepping, stepping out!
All done up for stepping out,
Make-up, gloves and gown.
Care?s are gone when I put on my favorite satin,
?Cause you put back the man in Manhattan.
--- Unknown ---
Let?s go stepping, stepping out!
What a town for stepping out.
East, West, up and down.
Let?s live dangerously and not get home ?til seven
From this heavenly night on the town.

From this heavenly night on the town.
From a heavenly night at the Copa!
