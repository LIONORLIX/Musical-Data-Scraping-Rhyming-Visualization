------ Just Arrived ------
--- Spoken: ---
Her name is... Lola!
She's from Tulsa.. yeah!
Just arrived, two suitcases in hand
And a dream in her heart
--- Unknown ---
Just arrived track seventeen
All the way from Tulsa Okla-nowhere
Where's her chauffeured limousine?
Where's the marching band?
Just in time to take the town
And though her knees are shaking
She's making her stand
--- Unknown ---
It all starts now
I can see her name in neon
I won't allow
Anyone to disagree
Don't ask me how
But before too long
She'll be on some marquee
New York or bust!
She's just arrived!
--- Unknown ---
Just arrived track seventeen
All the way from Tulsa Oklahoma
Though she's still a little green
When she left, she left her past behind
Just imagine, here she is the girl from work
--- Unknown ---
The kid they all made fun of
Is one of a kind
--- Unknown ---
It all starts now
Look who's currently appearing
This girl's a wow
All the magazines agree
She'll take her bow
And the world will all be cheering, wait and see
New York or bust
She's just arrived
--- Unknown ---
Hey!
Somebody said they're auditioning for south pacific
Say!
Somewhere I read they need lookers and she looks terrific
This is her moment
She knows it she can taste it
And she sure ain't gonna waste it
Cause it's time she faced it
--- Unknown ---
It all starts now
I can see her name in neon
This girl's a wow
All the magazines agree
She'll take her bow
And before too long she'll be on some marquee
--- Unknown ---
Gathering dust
She just survived
Now, New York or bust
She's just arrived!
Hey world
