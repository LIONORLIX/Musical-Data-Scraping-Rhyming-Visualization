------ Bolero de Amor ------
--- Unknown ---
There are times
You live as if in a dream
Drawn by your heart to a distant door
One that opens
For a moment
To a world that you've never known before
--- Unknown ---
Were you real
Or were you part of a dream
Calling to me from across the floor?
In your sweet voice
There was music
And we danced the bolero de amor
--- Unknown ---
Let the drums carry us away!
They say all there is to say
And all too soon the night becomes the day
And magical - miracle
--- Unknown ---
You are real
And we are living a dream
Sharing a love we have hungered for
Let your passion soar like music
In the spell of bolero de amor
--- Ensemble: ---
The drums carried us away
They said all there was to say
And all too soon the night became day
And magical-miracle
--- Unknown ---
There are times
You live as if in a dream
Drawn by your heart to a distant door
Trust your heart and
Take the moment
When you hear
Your bolero de amor
Amor
