------ Dancin' Fool ------
--- Unknown ---
When I hear a band blowin' basie
I can count on losing my cool
Take me where the rhythm is racy
Let me be a dancin' fool
--- Unknown ---
Some prefer the caf europa
Sipping dubonnet on a stool
Me, I get my kicks at the copa
That's where i'm a dancin' fool
I'll show you some moves
Smooth as satin
And others they don't teach in school
When that crooner starts in to scattin'
Just give me a chance an'
My tuxedo pants an'
Presto!
I'm a dancin' fool
--- Unknown ---
When those trumpets blare, man
I ain't got a care man
I'm like fred astaire, man
Cool!
--- Unknown ---
Just give me a chance an'
My tuxedo pants an'
--- Unknown ---
Presto!
