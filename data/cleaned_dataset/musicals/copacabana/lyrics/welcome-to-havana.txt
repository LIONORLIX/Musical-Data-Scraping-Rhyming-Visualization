VOICEOVER:Senoras y senores aqui esta la estrella de la Tropicana Conchita Alvarez y sus muchachos!

Welcome to Havana,How is everyone? Don't tell me. I think I know...
Your life is going crazy and you don't know what to do
Your business it went under And you're coming down with the flu.
Your son is going steady but his girl friends name is Frank
Your daughters made the evening news by holding up a bank.
--- Unknown ---
but you don't cry-ay-ay,
instead you fly-ay-ay
and when you get down here
all your worries disappear. Dear,
--- Unknown ---
Welcome to Havana where the world is on vacation
welcome to Havana, for the party of your life.
at the Tropicana life is one big celebration.
what a town, Havana. what a shame your brought your wife!
--- Unknown ---
It's the greatest city in the world. Beleave me, I know, I've been around!
Morocco has the Casbah but it also has the stench,
and Nice is very nice but then it also has the French.
It's much to cold in Sweden, and it's must to hot in Rome.
And if you go to London well, you might as well stay at home.
But here the air is clean, and here the palms are green.
so come and be our guest
--- ALL ---
And let Conchita do the rest.
--- CONCHITA ---
Welcome to Havana have a drink, no, have a double. welcome to Havana, where the moon is full and round.
Back in Indiana life is gloom and doom and trouble,
being in Havana makes my heart begin to pound!
ooh my heart goes boom--- chicka boom---
--- ALL ---
