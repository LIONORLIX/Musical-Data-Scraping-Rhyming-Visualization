------ Sweet Heaven ------
--- Unknown ---
Hey down there!
Look at me now
I'm flyin' high
Here I am
Heaven knows how
Heaven knows why
Guess I'm just a lucky guy
--- Unknown ---
Sweet heaven I'm in love again
Sweet heaven I'm in love again
You came along
Now what can I do?
I only want to be with you
--- Unknown ---
Sweet heaven here I go again
I'm hooked from head to toe again
One minute I'm so lonely and then
Oh, sweet heaven
--- Unknown ---
Hey, babe
Now that I found you
Life's a song
Say babe
Where you been hidin'?
I've been waiting so long
--- Unknown ---
Sweet heaven I'm in love again
So totally in love again
I'll shout it everywhere I go
I'll sing it on the radio
I want the whole world to know
Sweet heaven I'm in love again
--- Unknown ---
Sweet heaven I'm in love again
Incredibly in love again
You came along now what can I do
I only want to be with you
--- Unknown ---
So happy to be hooked again
My saturdays are booked again
One minute I'm so lonely and then
Oh sweet heaven
--- Unknown ---
Hey world
Stop what you're doin'
I've got news
Say world
Stop all the presses
I've stopped singing the blues
--- Unknown ---
Oh brother
I'm in love again
So totally in love again
I'll shout it everywhere I go
I'll sing in on the radio
I want the whole world to know
Sweet heaven I'm in love
Again
