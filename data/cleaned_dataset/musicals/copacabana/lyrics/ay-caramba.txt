I hear the congas I hear tymbalis my shoes
leave the ground and the world spins around !
Ay Caramba!
--- Unknown ---
They bang the bangos they click the clavis my lips start to-(kiss) and my hips start to-(bump) !Ay Caramba!
--- Unknown ---
Oh those persuasive percussive Caribbean rhythms
the more I resist the more they insist
Can't stop the congas,tymbalis the bongos,
the clavis and Ay! Ay! Ay! !Ay Caramba!
--- Unknown ---
I hear the rumba (you hear the rumba?)
and then the mambo (you want to mambo?)
wait, I think you should know Latin drums make me go
!Ay Caramba!
--- Unknown ---
They shake maracas (I shake maracas)
I go bananas (you like bananas?)
We start having fun but before it's all done
!Ay Caramba!
--- Unknown ---
Oh those crazy caressing Caribbean rhythms
to some it's so what to me it's so hot
Can't stop the rumba, the samba the mambo,
the bambo and Ay! Ay ! Ay! !Ay Caramba!
--- Unknown ---
Can't stop the congas,tymbalis the bongos,
the clavis the rumba, the samba, the mambo, the bambo and
