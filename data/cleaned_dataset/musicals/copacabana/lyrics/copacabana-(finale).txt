------ Copacabana (Finale) ------
--- TONY ---
Here we go, it?s partytime!
Here we go!
--- Unknown ---
Her name was Lola
She was a showgirl
With yellow feathers in her hair
And a dress cut down to there
She would merenque
And do the cha-cha
And while she tried to be a star
Tony always tended bar
Across the crowded floor
They worked from 8 till 4
They were young and they had each other
Who could ask for more?
--- ENSEMBLE & TONY ---
At the Copa, Copacabana
The hottest spot north of Havana
Here, at the Copa, Copacabana
Music and passion
were always te fashion
At the Copa
--- LOLA ---
His name was Rico
He wore a diamond
--- SAM ---
He was escorted to his chair
He saw Lola dancing there
--- GLADYS ---
And when she finished
He called her over
--- CONCHITA ---
But Rico went a bit too far
Tony sailed across the bar
--- RICO ---
And then the punches flew
Tables smashed in two.
--- TONY ---
There was blood and a single gunshot
But just who shot who?
--- ALLEN ---
At the Copa, Copacabana
The hottest spot north of Havana
Here, at the Copa, Copacabana
Music and passion
Were always the fashion
At the Copa
--- TONY ---
She lost her love
--- ALL ---
Copa, Copacabana
Copacabana
Music and passion
always the fashion
--- Unknown ---
At the Copa, Copacabana
The hottest spot north of Havana
Here, at the Copa, Copacabana
Music and passion
Were always the fashion
At the Copa?
You?ll fall in love!!
