------ Lovely (Reprise) ------
--- PSEUDOLUS ---
Come out here! Come on out!
--- HYSTERIUM ---
You didn't tell me I'd have to be a girl
--- PSEUDOLUS ---
A dead girl. The captain will see you, go on his way and all will be well.
--- HYSTERIUM ---
He'll never believe I'm a girl. Look at me. Just look at me.
--- PSEUDOLUS ---
I can't take my eyes off you
You're lovely,
Absolutely lovely,
Who'd believe the loveliness of you?
--- HYSTERIUM ---
No.
--- PSEUDOLUS ---
Come back.
Perfect,
Sweet and warm and winsome,
Radiant as in some
Dream come true.
--- Unknown ---
Now
Venus will seem tame,
Helen and her thousand ships
Will have to die of shame!
You're so lovely,
Literally lovely,
That the world will never seem the same!
--- Unknown ---
Now lie there, close your eyes and think dead thoughts. Good!
--- HYSTERIUM ---
I'm lovely,
Absolutely lovely,
Who'd believe the loveliness of me?
Perfect,
Sweet and warm and winsome,
Radiant as in some dream come true.
Now. . .
--- HYSTERIUM ---
Shouldn't I have some jewelry?
--- PSEUDOLUS ---
Jewelry?
--- HYSTERIUM ---
Yeah!
--- PSEUDOLUS ---
Here - take the old man's ring.
--- HYSTERIUM ---
Flowers!
--- PSEUDOLUS ---
What?
--- HYSTERIUM ---
I should have some flowers!
--- PSEUDOLUS ---
Flowers? Flowers!
--- HYSTERIUM ---
I'm so lovel,
--- PSEUDOLUS ---
Frighteningly lovely -
--- BOTH ---
That the world will never seem the same -
--- PSEUDOLUS ---
You're so lovely -
--- BOTH ---
