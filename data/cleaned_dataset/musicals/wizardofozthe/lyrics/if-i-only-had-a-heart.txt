------ If I Only Had A Heart ------
--- Unknown ---
Tin Man
When a man's an empty kettle he should be on his mettle,
And yet I'm torn apart.
Just because I'm presumin' that I could be kind-a-human,
If I only had a heart
I'd be tender - I'd be gentle and awful sentimental
Regarding love and art.
I'd be friends with the sparrows ... and the boys who shoots the arrows
If I only had a heart.
Picture me - a balcony. Above a voice sings low.
Dorothy
Wherefore art thou, Romeo?
Tin Man
I hear a beat....How sweet.
Just to register emotion, jealousy - devotion,
And really feel the part.
I could stay young and chipper and I'd lock it with a zipper, If I only had a heart.
Dorothy
That was wonderful! You know, we were just wondering why you couldn't come with us to
the Emerald City to ask the Wizard of Oz for a heart.
Tin Man
Well, suppose the Wizard wouldn't give me one when we got there?
Dorothy
Oh, but he will! He must! We've come such a long way already.
Scarecrow
To Oz?
Tin Man
To Oz!
