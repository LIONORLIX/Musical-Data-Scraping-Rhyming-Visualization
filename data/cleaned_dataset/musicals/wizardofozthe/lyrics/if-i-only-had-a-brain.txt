------ If I Only Had A Brain ------
--- Unknown ---
Scarecrow
I could while away the hours, conferrin' with the flowers
Consultin' with the rain.
And my head I'd be scratchin' while my thoughts were busy hatchin'
If I only had a brain.
I'd unravel every riddle for any individ'le,
In trouble or in pain.
Dorothy
With the thoughts you'll be thinkin' you could be another Lincoln
If you only had a brain.
Scarecrow
Oh, I could tell you why The ocean's near the shore.
I could think of things I never thunk before.
And then I'd sit, and think some more.
I would not be just a nothin' my head all full of stuffin'
My heart all full of pain.
I would dance and be merry, life would be a ding-a-derry,
If I only had a brain.
Dorothy
Ohh! Wonderful!
Why, if our scarecrow back in Kansas could do that, the crows'd be scared to pieces!
Scarecrow
They would?
Dorothy
Yes
Scarecrow
Where's Kansas?
Dorothy
That's where I live. And I want to get back there so badly, I'm going all the way to the
Emeralk City to get the Wizard of Oz to help me.
Scarecrow
Do you think if I went wtih you this Wizard would give me some brains?
Dorothy
I couldn't say. But even if he didn't you'd be no worse off than you are now.
Scarecrow
Yes, that's true.
Scarecrow
Look - I won't be any trouble, because I don't eat a thing, and I won't try to manage things,
because I can't think. Won't you take me with you?
Dorothy
Of course, I will.
Scarecrow
Hooray! We're off to see a Wizard!
Dorothy
Oh - well, you're not starting out very well.
Scarecrow
Oh, I'll try! Really, I will.
Dorothy
To Oz?
Dorothy
