------ Nobody Understands Me ------
--- Unknown ---
I've always played the fool around here
I'm starting to worry that
I rush through life forgetting to breath
We all need some time to adapt
No one understands
No one understands
What it’s like
--- Unknown ---
I had high hopes of silver and gold;
I thought this could change for the best
My mom always said I was named for a saint
but I never felt I was blessed
No one understands
No one understands
No one understands
What it's like
--- Unknown ---
I got your cure right here
Is that what you want to hear’
I've played the fool too many times
I've been catching up
For all my life
And it seems
It gets harder to believe it gets harder but
Be honest
If the sun don’t shine tomorrow we’ll survive
--- Unknown ---
I turn this up as loud as it goes
And it ain't doing much for the pain
It’s up to me and the heart on my sleeve
That hasn’t quite been the same
No one understands
No one understands
No one understands
What it's like
--- Unknown ---
I got your cure right here
Is that what you want to hear’
I've played the fool too many times
I've been catching up for all my life and it seems
It gets harder to believe
It gets harder but
Be honest
If the sun don’t shine tomorrow we’ll survive
--- Unknown ---
I'm in a field of landmines
A cruise ship to hell
O but I don’t think about that
It's so hard to find help
these days
When everyone's counting on me
But I'm burnt already
--- Unknown ---
I got your cure right here
Is that what you want to hear’
I've played the fool too many times
I've been catching up for all my life and it seems
It gets harder to believe
it gets harder but be honest
If the sun don’t shine tomorrow
If the sun don’t shine tomorrow
If the sun don’t shine tomorrow
then we’ll survive
