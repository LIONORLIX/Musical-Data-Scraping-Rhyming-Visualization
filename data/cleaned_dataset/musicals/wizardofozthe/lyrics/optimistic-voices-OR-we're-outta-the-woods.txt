------ Optimistic Voices / We're Outta The Woods ------
--- Unknown ---
You're out of the woods
You're out of the dark
You're out of the night
Step into the sun
Step into the light
--- Unknown ---
Keep straight ahead for the most glorious place
On the face of the earth or the sky
Hold onto your breath
Hold onto your heart
Hold onto your hope
March up to the gate and bid it open
--- Unknown ---
You're out of the woods
You're out of the dark
You're out of the night
Step into the sun
Step into the light
