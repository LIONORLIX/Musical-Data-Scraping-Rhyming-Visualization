------ If You Could See Her ------
--- EMCEE ---
I know what you're thinking?
You wonder why I chose her
Out of all the ladies in the world.
That's just a first impression?
What good's a first impression?
If you knew her like I do,
It would change your point of view.
--- Unknown ---
If you could see her through my eyes,
You wouldn't wonder at all.
If you could see her through my eyes,
I guarantee you would fall like I did.
--- Unknown ---
When we're in public together,
I hear society groan.
But if they could see her through my eyes,
Maybe they'd leave us alone.
--- Unknown ---
How can I speak of her virtues?
I don't know where to begin:
She's clever, she's smart, she reads music,
She doesn't smoke or drink gin like I do.
--- Unknown ---
Yet when we're walking together,
They sneer if I'm holding her hand.
But if they could see her through my eyes,
Maybe they'd all understand.
--- Unknown ---
(They waltz)
--- Unknown ---
I understand your objection,
I grant you the problem's not small.
But if you could see her through my eyes,
She wouldn't look Jewish at all!
