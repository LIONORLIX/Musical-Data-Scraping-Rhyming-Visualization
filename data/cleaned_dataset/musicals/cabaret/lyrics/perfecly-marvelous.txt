------ Perfecly Marvelous ------
--- SALLY (spoken) ---
I think people are perfectly marvellous, I really do, Cliff.
Don't you? I don't think people should have to explain
anything. For example, if I should paint my fingernails green
and it just so happens I do paint them green, well, if anyone
should ask me why, I say:  I think it's pretty! (I think
it's pretty, I reply.)  So, if anyone should ask about you
and me, you have two alternatives: you can either say,
Oh, yes, it's true.  We're living in delicious sin. Or
you can simple tell the truth, and say:

I met this perfectly marvellous girl
In this perfectly wonderful place
As I lifted a glass
To the start of a marvellous year.
Before I knew she called on the phone,
Inviting.
Next moment I was no longer alone,
But sat reciting
Some perfectly beautiful verse,
In my charming Amearican style.
How I dazzled her senses
Was truly no less than a crime.
--- Unknown ---
Now I've this perfectly marvelous girl
In my perfectly beautiful room
And we're living together
And having a marvellous time.
--- CLIFF (spoken) ---
Sally, I'm afraid this wouldn't work out. You're much
too distracting.
--- SALLY (spoken) ---
Distracting? No, inspiring!
--- Unknown ---
She tell me perfectly marvellous tales
Of her thrillingly scandalous life
Which I'll probably use
As a chapter or two in my book.
--- Unknown ---
And since my stay in Berlin was to force
Creation,
What luck to fall on a fabulous source
Of stimulation.
And perfectly marvellous, too,
Is her perfect agreement to be
Just as still as a mouse
When I'm giving my novel a whirl.
--- Unknown ---
Yes, I've a highly agreeable life
In my perfectly beautiful room
With my nearly invisible,
Perfectly marvellous, girl.
--- CLIFF (spoken) ---
Sally- I just can't afford... Do you have any money?
--- SALLY ---
A few marks... Six!
--- CLIFF ---
Oh, God!
--- SALLY ---
Oh, please, Cliff- just for a day or two? Please!
--- CLIFF ---
I... met... this...
Truly remarkable girl
In this really incredible town,
And she skillfully managed
To talk her way in to my room.
--- SALLY ---
Oh, Cliff!
--- CLIFF ---
I have a terrible feeling I've said
A dumb thing.
Beside, I've only got one narrow bed.
