------ Don't Tell Mama ------
--- EMCEE ---
And now, meine Damen und Herren... Mesdames et
Messieurs... Ladies and Gentlemen- The Kit Kat Klub
is proud to present a most talented young lady from
England. Yes- England! I give you- and don't forget
to give her back when you're finished with her- the
toast of Mayfair... Fraulein Sally Bowles!!

Mama
Thinks I'm living in a convent,
A secluded little convent
In the southern part of France.
--- Unknown ---
Mama
Doesn't even have an inkling
That I'm working in a Nightclub
In a pair of Lacy pants.
So please, sir.
If you run into my Mama,
Don't reveal my indiscretion,
Give a working girl a chance.
--- Unknown ---
Hush up,
Don't tell Mama,
Shush up,
Don't tell Mama...
Don't tell Mama,
Whatever you do.
If you had a secret,
You bet I would keep it.
I would never tell on  you.
I'm breaking every promise
That I gave her,
So won't you kindly do a girl
A great big favor?
And please, my sweet patater,
Keep this from the Mater,
Though my dance
Is not against the law.
--- Unknown ---
You can tell my Papa, that's all right,
'Cause he comes in here every night,
But don't tell Mama what you saw!
--- ALL ---
Mama
Thinks I'm on a tour of Europe,
With a couple of my school chums
And a lady chaperone.
--- Unknown ---
Mama
Doesn't even have an inling
That I left them all in Antwerp
And I'm touring on my own.
--- Unknown ---
So please, Sir
If you run into my Mama
Don't reveal my indiscretion.
--- SALLY ---
Just leave well enough alone.
--- Unknown ---
Hush up,
--- ALL ---
Don't tell Mama.
--- SALLY ---
Shush up,
--- ALL ---
Don't tell Mama;
Don't tell Mama
Whatever you do.
--- SALLY ---
If you had a secret,
You bet I would keep it.
--- ALL ---
I would never tell on  you.
You wouldn't want to get me
In a pickle,
--- SALLY ---
And have her go and cut me off
Without a nickle.
--- ALL ---
So let's trust one another,
Keep this from my mother,
Though I'm still as pure as mountain snow.
--- SALLY ---
You can tell my Uncle
Here and now
'Cause he's my agent anyhow,
--- KIT KAT GIRLS ---
But don't tell Mama what you know.
--- SALLY ---
You can tell my brother,
That ain't grim
'Cause if her squeals on me
I'll squeal on him,
--- ALL ---
But don't tell Mama, bitte
Don't tell Mama, please, Sir.
Don't tell Mama, what you know.
--- GIRLS ---
Sssh!
Sssh!
--- SALLY ---
If you see my, Mummy,
