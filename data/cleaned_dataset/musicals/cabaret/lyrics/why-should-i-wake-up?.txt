------ Why Should I Wake Up? ------
--- Unknown ---
Why should I wake up?
This dream is going so well.
When you're enchanted,
Why break the spell?
Drifting in this euphoric state,
Morning can wait.
Let it come late.
Why should I wake up?
Why waste a drop of the wine?
Don't I adore you?
And aren't you mine?
Maybe I'll someday be lonely again.
But why should I wake up till then?
