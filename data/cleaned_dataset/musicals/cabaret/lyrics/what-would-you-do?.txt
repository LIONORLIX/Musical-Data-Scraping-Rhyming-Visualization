------ What Would You Do? ------
--- FRAULEIN SCHNEIDER ---
With time rushing by,
What would you do?
--- Unknown ---
With the clock running down,
What would you do?
The young always have the cure-
Being brave, being sure
And free,
But imagine if you were me.
Alone like me,
And this is the only world you know.
Some rooms to let?
The sum of a lifetime, even so.
--- Unknown ---
I'll take your advice.
What would you do?
--- Unknown ---
Would you pay the price?
What would you do?
--- Unknown ---
Suppose simply keeping still
Means you manage until the end?
What would you do,
My brave young friend?
--- Unknown ---
Grown old like me,
With neither the will nor wish to run;
Grown tired like me,
Who hurries for bed when day is done;
Grown wise like me,
Who isn't at war with anyone?
Not anyone!
--- Unknown ---
With a storm in the wind,
What would you do?
--- Unknown ---
Suppose you're one frightened voice
Being told what the choice must be.
--- Unknown ---
Go on; tell me,
I will listen.
What would you do?
If you were me?
