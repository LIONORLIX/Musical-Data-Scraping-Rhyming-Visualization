------ Maybe this Time ------
--- SALLY ---
Maybe this time, I'll be lucky
Maybe this time, he'll stay
Maybe this time
For the first time
Love won't hurry away
--- Unknown ---
He will hold me fast
I'll be home at last
Not a loser anymore
Like the last time
And the time before
--- Unknown ---
Everybody loves a winner
So nobody loved me;
'Lady Peaceful,' 'Lady Happy,'
That's what I long to be
All the odds are in my favor
Something's bound to begin
It's got to happen, happen sometime
