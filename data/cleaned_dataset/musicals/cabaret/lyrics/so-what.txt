------ So What ------
--- FRAULEIN SCHNEIDER ---
You say fifty marks. I say one hundred marks, a
[spoken in rythm]
difference of fifty marks-
Why should that stand in our way?
As long as the room gets let,
the fifty that I will get
is fifty more that I had yesterday,
Ja?
--- Unknown ---
When you're as old as I..
is anyone as old as I?-
What difference does it make?
An offer comes, you take.
--- sings ---
For the sun will rise
And the moon will set
And learn how to settle
For what you get.
It will all go on if we're here or not
So who cares? So what?
So who cares? So what?

When I was a girl,
My summers were spent by the sea.
So what?
And I had a maid
Doing all of the house-work, not me.
So what?
Now I scrub all the floors
And I wash down the walls
And I empty the chamber pot.
If it ended that way,
Then it ended that way,
And I shrug and I say:
So what?
--- Unknown ---
For the sun will rise
And the moon will set
And learn how to settle
For what you get.
It will all go on if we're here or not
So who cares? So what?
So who cares? So what?

When I had a man,
My figure was dumpy and fat.
So what?
Through all of our years
He was so disappointed in that.
So what?
Now I have what he missed
And my figure is trim,
But he lies in a churchyard plot
If it wasn't to be
That he ever would see
The uncorseted me,
So what?
--- Unknown ---
For the sun will rise
And the moon will set
And learn how to settle
For what you get.
It will all go on if we're here or not
So who cares? So what?
So who cares? So what?
--- Unknown ---
So once I was rich
And now all my fortune is gone,
So what?
And love disappeared
And only the memory lives on,
And so what?
--- Unknown ---
If I've lived through all that
Fifty marks doesn't mean a lot.
If I like that you're here
Happy New Year, my dear,
So what?
--- Unknown ---
For the sun will rise
And the moon will set
And learn how to settle
For what you get.
It will all go on if we're here or not
So who cares? So what?
So who cares? So what?
--- Unknown ---
It all goes on.
So who cares? Who cares?
