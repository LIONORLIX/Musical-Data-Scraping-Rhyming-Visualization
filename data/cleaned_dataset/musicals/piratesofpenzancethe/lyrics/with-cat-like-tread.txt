------ With Cat-Like Tread ------
--- Unknown ---
Pirates
With Cat-Like Tread
Upon our prey we steal
In silence dread
Our cautious way we feel
No sound at all
We never speak a word
A fly's foot-fall
Would be distinctly heard
--- Police ---
Tarantara, Tarantara.
--- Pirates ---
So stealthily the pirate creeps
While all the household soundly sleeps
--- Unknown ---
Come friends, who plough the sea
Truce to navigation
Take another station
Let's vary piracy
With a little burglary
--- Samuel ---
Here's your crowbar
And your centre bit
Your life preserver
You may want to hit
--- Unknown ---
Your silent matches
Your dark lantern seize
Take your file
And your skeletonic keys
--- Police ---
