Stop, ladies, pray!
Chorus. (Hopping on one foot.)
A man!
Frederic.
I had intended
Not to intrude myself upon your notice
In this effective but alarming costume;
But under these peculiar circumstances,
It is my bounden duty to inform you
That your proceedings will not be unwitnessed!
Edith.
But who are you, sir? Speak! (All hopping.)
Frederic.
I am a pirate!
Chorus. (recoiling, hopping)
A pirate! Horror!

Frederic.
Ladies, do not shun me!
This evening I renounce my vile profession.
And to that end,
O pure and peerless maidens,
O blushing buds of everblooming beauty,
I, sore at heart,
I, sore at heart,
Implore your kind assistance.
--- Edith ---
How pitiful his tale!
--- Kate ---
How rare his beauty!
--- Daughters ---
How pitiful his tale!
