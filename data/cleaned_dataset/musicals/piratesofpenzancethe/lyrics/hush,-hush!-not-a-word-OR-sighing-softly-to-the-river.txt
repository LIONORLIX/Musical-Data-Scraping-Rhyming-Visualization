------ Hush, Hush! Not a Word / Sighing Softly to the River ------

Frederic.
Hush, hush! not a word; I see a light inside!
The Major-General comes, so quickly hide!
--- Unknown ---
Pirates.
Yes, yes, the Major-General comes!
--- Unknown ---
Police.
Yes, yes, the Major-General comes!
--- Unknown ---
General.
Yes, yes, the Major-General comes!
--- Unknown ---
Tormented with the anguish dread
Of falsehood unatoned,
I lay upon my sleepless bed,
And tossed and turned and groaned.
The man who finds his conscience ache
No peace at all enjoys;
And as I lay in bed awake,
I thought I heard a noise.
--- Unknown ---
Chorus.
He thought he heard a noise - ha! ha!
--- Unknown ---
General.
No, all is still
In dale, on hill;
My mind is set at ease -
So still the scene,
It must have been
The sighing of the breeze.
--- Unknown ---
General.
Sighing softly to the river
Comes the loving breeze,
Setting nature all a-quiver,
Rustling through the trees.
Chorus.
Through the trees.
--- Unknown ---
And the brook, in rippling measure,
Laughs for very love,
While the poplars, in their pleasure,
Wave their arms above.
--- Unknown ---
Chorus.
Yes, the trees, for very love,
Wave their leafy arms above.
--- Unknown ---
General & Chorus.
River, river, little river,
May thy loving prosper ever!
Heaven speed thee, poplar tree,
May thy wooing happy be.
Heaven speed thee, poplar tree,
May thy wooing happy be.
--- Unknown ---
General.
Yet, the breeze is but a rover,
When he wings away,
Brook and poplar mourn a lover
Sighing, Well-a-day!
--- Unknown ---
Chorus.
Well-a-day!
--- Unknown ---
General.
Ah! the doing and undoing,
That the rogue could tell!
When the breeze is out a-wooing,
Who can woo so well?
--- Unknown ---
Chorus.
Shocking tales the rogue could tell,
Nobody can woo so well.
--- Unknown ---
General & Chorus.
Pretty brook, thy dream is over,
For thy love is but a rover;
Sad the lot of poplar trees,
Courted by a fickle breeze,
Sad the lot of poplar trees,
