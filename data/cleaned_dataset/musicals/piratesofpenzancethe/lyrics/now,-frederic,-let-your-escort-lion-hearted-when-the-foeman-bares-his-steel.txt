And your heart is in your boots,

There is nothing brings it round
Like the trumpet's martial sound,

Go, ye heroes, go to glory,
Though you die in combat gory,
Ye shall live in song and story.
Go to immortality!
Go to death, and go to slaughter;
Die, and every Cornish daughter
With her tears your grave shall water.
Go, ye heroes, go and die!
--- Unknown ---
Girls.
Go, ye heroes, go and die!
Go, ye heroes, go and die!

Though to us it's evident,

Go and do your best endeavour,
And before all links we sever,
We will say farewell for ever.
Go to glory and the grave!
--- Unknown ---
Girls.
Go to glory and the grave!
For your foes are fierce and ruthless,
False, unmerciful, and truthless;
Young and tender, old and toothless,
All in vain their mercy crave.
--- Unknown ---
Sergeant.
We observe too great a stress,
On the risks that on us press,
And of reference a lack
To our chance of coming back.
Still, perhaps it would be wise
Not to carp or criticise,
For it's very evident
These attentions are well meant.
--- Unknown ---
Police.
Yes, it's very evident
These attentions are well meant,
Evident,
Yes, well meant;
Evident,
--- Unknown ---
Sergeant & Police.
Ah, yes, well meant!
--- Unknown ---
(All three parts repeat at same time.)
--- Unknown ---
General.
Away, away!
These pirates slay!
Then do not stay!
Then why this delay!
--- Unknown ---
Yes, but you don't go!
--- Unknown ---
Yes, but you don't go!
--- Unknown ---
At last they go,
At last they go, at last they go!
At last they really, really go!
--- Unknown ---
Girls.
Yes, forward on the foe,
--- Unknown ---
They go, they go!
--- Unknown ---
Yes, forward on the foe,
--- Unknown ---
At last they go,
At last they go, at last they go!
At last they really, really go!
--- Unknown ---
Police.
Yes, yes, we go!
--- Unknown ---

All right, we go!
Yes forward

--- Unknown ---
We go, we go!
Yes forward
on the foe, Yes, forward on the foe,
--- Unknown ---
We go, we go,
We go, we go,
We go, we go, we go, we go!
