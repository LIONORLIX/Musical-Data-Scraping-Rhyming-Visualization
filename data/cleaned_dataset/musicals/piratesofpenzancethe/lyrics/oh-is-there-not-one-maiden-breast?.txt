------ Oh Is There Not One Maiden Breast? ------
--- Unknown ---
(Fredrick)
Oh is there not one maiden breast,
Which does not feel the moral beauty.
Of making worldly interest,
Subordinate to sense of duty.
--- Unknown ---
(Fredrick)
Who would not give up willing all matrimonial ambition?
To rescue such a one as I from his unfortunate position,
From his position.
To rescue such a one as I from his unfortunate position!
--- Unknown ---
(Daughters)
Alas, there's not one maiden breast,
Which seems to feel the moral beauty.
Of making worldly interest,
Subordinate to sense of duty.
--- Unknown ---
(Fredrick)
Oh is there not one maiden here
Whose homely face and bad complexion,
Have caused all hope to disappear
Of ever winning mans affection
--- Unknown ---
(Fredrick)
To such a one if such there be
I swear by heavens arch above you
if you will cast your eyes on me
However plain you'll be I'll love you,
However plain you'll be.
--- Unknown ---
(Fredrick)
If you will cast your eyes on me
However plain you'll be I'll love you,
I'll love you. I'll love, I'll lo-o-ove you.
--- Unknown ---
(Chorus)
Alas there's not one maiden here
Whose homely face and bad complexion
has caused all hope to disappear
Of ever winning mans affection
--- Unknown ---

No, no not one.
