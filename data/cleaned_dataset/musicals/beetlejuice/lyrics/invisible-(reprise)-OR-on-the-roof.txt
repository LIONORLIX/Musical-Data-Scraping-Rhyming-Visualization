------ Invisible (Reprise) / On The Roof ------
--- BETELGEUSE: ---
You're invisible when you’re me
There's no one to see my truth
If they could look up they’d see
Hey, somebody's on the roof!
--- Unknown ---
God, it's mortifying
What's the point of even trying?
'Cus now
I'm trapped with no escape
Banished, disavowed
I vanished like a cloud of dirty hipster vape
[*crying*]
--- Unknown ---
Nobody said life’s fair
Guess they will never see
The demon who isn’t there
You’re invisible when you’re
--- BETELGEUSE, spoken: ---
Me
--- Unknown ---
Whoa, what have we got here?
--- LYDIA, spoken: ---
By the time you read this
I, Lydia Deetz, will be gone
There's nothing for me here
I'm alone, forsaken, invisible
--- BETELGEUSE, spoken: ---
That makes two of us...
--- LYDIA, spoken: ---
Who the hell are you?
--- BETELGEUSE, spoken: ---
Can you...
See me?!
--- LYDIA, spoken: ---
Yeah...
--- BETELGEUSE, spoken: ---
You can see me!
--- BETELGEUSE, sung: ---
