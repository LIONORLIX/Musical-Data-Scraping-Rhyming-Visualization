------ Prologue: Invisible ------
--- ENSEMBLE: ---
Daylight come and we wan' go~
--- PASTOR, spoken: ---
In times like these, we have no words
We have only each other
Today we come together to mourn the passing of Emily Deetz
Devoted wife of Charles
Beloved mother to Lydia
Scripture tells us
Sorrow not, for we do not walk alone.
--- LYDIA: ---
You're invisible when you're sad
Clocks tick and phones still ring
The world carries on like mad
But nobody sees a thing
--- Unknown ---
Whispering behind their hands
Lost for kind words to say
Nobody understands
And everyone goes away
--- Unknown ---
Grownups wanna' fix things
When they can't it only fills them with shame
So they just look away
Is it being greedy to need somebody to see me
And say my name?
--- Unknown ---
Seems when you lose your mom
No one turns off the sun
Folks carry on, that's that
You're invisible when you're sad
--- BETELGEUSE, spoken: ---
Holy crap, a ballad already?
