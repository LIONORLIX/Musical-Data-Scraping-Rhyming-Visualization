------ No Reason ------
--- DELIA, sung: ---
The universe
Is more than just space with no end
La-la-la-la-la!
Just think of the universe as a female best friend
And you can be like
Hey, Universe, what's happening, girl?
And she'll be like
Oh, nothing - just running the world.
And you'll be like What?
And the universe will be like I know!
You're on the right track, girl
I got your back, girl
I'm helping you grow
Think positive
Act positive
You are a child of the Earth!
--- DELIA, spoken: ---
Life-coaching!
Nailing it!
--- DELIA, sung: ---
Time to take command
You dictate the hand
The universe deals
Look!
Science makes no sense
Who needs evidence?
Go with your feels
I'm like a radio
Tuned to the stars
I found my frequency
Crystals speak to me
--- LYDIA, spoken: ---
What are they saying?
--- DELIA, spoken: ---
Buy more crystals!
--- DELIA, sung: ---
Everything, everything happens for a reason
Be a beacon of light in the world
Put a little alright in the world
There is spiritual guides above
Look up and see 'em!
Perception is reality
Just listen to the melody the universe sings
'Cause everything- everything happens for a reason
--- LYDIA, spoken: ---
Gee, I hate to break it to you
--- LYDIA, sung: ---
The universe is just the contents of time, matter and space
--- DELIA, spoken: ---
Yeah-
--- LYDIA, sung: ---
Ninety-one billion light-years across and the Earth's a small place
Where good people die-
--- DELIA, spoken: ---
No-
--- LYDIA, spoken: ---
Yeah
--- LYDIA, sung: ---
In famine and wars
The Pacific Islands are sinking
But negative thinking is hardly the cause
You think life is all unicorns and rainbows 'cause you're bored
And positivity is a luxury that few can afford
--- Unknown ---
We're gonna die
Yes, you and I
In meaninglessness and alone~
--- DELIA: ---
No no no!
No!
One day you may wake up alone
--- LYDIA, spoken: ---
Okay?
--- DELIA: ---
'Cause your husband and his boyfriend bought a boat
And then they sailed away to Rome
--- LYDIA, spoken: ---
That's specific
--- DELIA: ---
So you cry yourself to sleep in deep despair
Talking to the walls 'cause there's no one there
And you have to buy a cat
'Cause that's your last chance to have a family
Take it from me!
That your aging ass will have to believe that-!
--- Unknown ---
Everything- everything happens for a reason
Put some more fun in the world
A little I AM STILL YOUNG in the world
Be prepared to take your eggs and freeze 'em-
--- LYDIA, spoken: ---
Is this still about me?
--- DELIA: ---
'Cause everything- everything happens
--- LYDIA: ---
Sounds like terrible things can happen
Because the universe is random
--- DELIA, spoken: ---
Yes, but
--- DELIA, sung: ---
Random for a reason!
--- LYDIA: ---
