------ Say My Name ------
--- Beetlejuice: ---
You could use a buddy
Don't you want a pal?
Girl, the way I see it
Your daddy should be leavin'
And you should stick around!
--- Beetlejuice: ---
--- Lydia: ---
What?
--- Beetlejuice: ---
Nothing
--- Beetlejuice, sung: ---
So, Lydia, don't end yourself
Defend yourself
Daddy is the one you should maim
Together we'll exterminate, assassinate
--- Lydia: ---
No!
--- Beetlejuice: ---
The finer points can wait
But first you gotta say my name!
--- Unknown ---
Go ahead and jump but that won't stop him
Here you got a solid plan B option
I can bring your daddy so much pain
All you gotta do is say my name!
Girl, just say it three times in a row
Then you won't believe how far I'll go
I'm on the bench, but coach
Just put me in the game
All you gotta do is say my name
--- Lydia: ---
I don't know your name
--- Beetlejuice: ---
Well, I can't SAY it
--- Lydia: ---
How 'bout a game of charades?
--- Beetlejuice: ---
Yes, let's play it
--- Lydia: ---
Two words
--- Beetlejuice: ---
Right
--- Lydia: ---
Second word
--- Beetlejuice: ---
Uh-huh
--- Lydia: ---
Drink?
--- Beetlejuice: ---
No
--- Lydia: ---
Beverage?
--- Beetlejuice: ---
No
--- Lydia: ---
Wine?
--- Beetlejuice: ---
No
--- Lydia: ---

Ant?
--- Beetlejuice: ---
Close, but no
--- Lydia: ---
Beetle?
--- Beetlejuice: ---
Yes!
--- Lydia: ---
Beetlejuice?
--- Beetlejuice: ---
Wow, I'm impressed
And all you gotta do is say my name three times
Three times in a row it must be spoken
Unbroken
Ready?
--- Lydia: ---
Yeah
--- Beetlejuice: ---
Okay, go...
--- Lydia: ---
Beetlejuice...
--- Beetlejuice: ---
Yes
--- Lydia: ---
Beetlejuice...
--- Beetlejuice: ---
Yes
--- Lydia: ---
Beeeeeeeeeeeeee—
--- Beetlejuice: ---
Oh, oh, this is gonna be so good
--- Lydia: ---
—cause
--- Beetlejuice: ---
What?
--- Lydia: ---
You're so smart
A stand-up bro
I'll think about your offer
Let you know
But I prefer my chances down below
Beetlejuice
--- Beetlejuice: ---
Yes!
--- Lydia: ---
Beetlejuice
--- Beetlejuice: ---
Yes!
--- Lydia: ---
Being young and female doesn't mean that I'm an easy mark
I've been swimming with piranhas
I don't need a shark
Yes, life sucks
But not that much
OK, Beetlejuice
Beetlejuice
Be a doll and spare the lecture
--- Beetlejuice: ---
I'm offering you a full-time spectre
--- Lydia: ---
Are you any good?
--- Beetlejuice: ---
You bet you
Trust me, baby!
--- Lydia: ---
I just met ya
Really it's a flattering offer
--- Beetlejuice: ---
Don't you wanna see dad suffer?
--- Lydia: ---
I think I'd rather just jump off
--- Beetlejuice: ---
No!
--- Lydia: ---
I may be suicidal
But Beetlejuice, it's not as if I've lost my mind
--- Beetlejuice: ---
So, playing hardball, huh?
You are tougher than you look
--- Lydia: ---
Just wanna make sure I know who I'm working with
Got any references?
--- Barbara: ---
Lydia, there you are!
--- Adam: ---
Are you alright?
--- Beetlejuice: ---
A-Dog, B-Town, my old pals!
--- Adam: ---
Get away from her!
Lydia, this is a dangerously unstable individual
--- Beetlejuice possesses Barbara and Adam ---
--- Barbara: ---
Beetlejuice is sexy!
--- Adam: ---
Beetlejuice is smart!
--- Barbara & Adam: ---
BJ is a graduate of Juilliard!
He can help
We found him on Yelp
Our troubles all ended on the day that we befriended him
Every word is the truth
Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice!
--- Barbara: ---
What the heck was that?
--- Adam: ---
So violating!
--- Beetlejuice: ---
There you go, kid
Couple of five-star reviews
--- Lydia: ---
What was that?
--- Beetlejuice: ---
That was possession
Any ghost can do that in less than one lesson
--- Lydia: ---
Any ghost?
--- Beetlejuice: ---
Pretty much, any ghost'll do sure
--- Lydia: ---
Then, Beetlejuice, who do I need you for?
--- Beetlejuice: ---
Whoa, whoa, whoa whoa whoa!
Hold up- hold up, girl, I'm your pal
They're sweet, but I'm a demon straight from Hell
I know, I went a little hard on the sell
But we're BF-F-F-F's forever!
--- Beetlejuice gets pushed off the roof of the house by Lydia ---
Agh!
--- Adam and Barbara: ---
Lydia!
--- Lydia: ---
What? He was already dead
And you heard what he said, any ghost can do that possession stuff
--- Lydia, sung: ---
We don't need that demon
The three of us alone can wreck dad's evening
Together we can make a grown man weep
Guys got a dinner date to keep
--- Adam: ---
Okay, so what's the plan?
--- Lydia (with Adam & Barbara): ---
Teach dad a lesson
He's gonna freak when we possess him
So he wants the perfect daughter
I'll lead that lamb to slaughter
Yeah, I got game!
I'm gonna make him say my name
I'll make him say my name
I'll make him say my name
Not running away!
