------ Good Old Fashioned Wedding ------
--- BETELGEUSE: ---
There's gonna be a-
Good old-fashioned wedding
With some dancing and un-deading
With a cover-band is cranking
And the age gap will be upsetting
When I finally say I do
I'll be alive and born anew
And I'll be boring just like you
Oh boy, I'm on my way!
--- Unknown ---
Being dead sucks
Rent me a tux
I wanna look like a million bucks
BJ'S getting married-
--- LYDIA, spoken: ---
Hey Beetlejuice, I'm going to the Netherworld!
--- BETELGEUSE, spoken: ---
What?
--- LYDIA, spoken: ---
Classic bait and switch!
Oldest trick in the book!
--- CHARLES, spoken: ---
Lydia! No!
--- BETELGEUSE, spoken: ---
No, no, no!
Why DOES EVERYONE KEEP LEAVING ME!?
Okay, new plan:
You're all gonna die
--- BETELGEUSE, sung: ---
