------ Ready, Set, Not Yet ------
--- ADAM: ---
Look at this crib
In all of its glorious antiquary
Every curve and surface speaks to me
Saying pamper and spoil me
Sand me and oil me
Come on
I know to the untrained eye it's boring
But nothing's a chore when you're restoring
Apart from frustration, pain, and financial drain
It's fun!
--- Unknown ---
Folks say "Adam
Why do you polish your crib when you don't have a kid?
And even if you did have a kid,
This crib is too precious for placing a baby inside it
So it simply exists to remind you
Your sense of perfection is just a reflection that you are not mentally prepared to make room for a kid
Adam, why don't you live?
Adam, just make a start
Are you willing to take the next step?
Ready, set-
Ready, set-
--- BARBARA, spoken: ---
Look at these jugs!
--- BARBARA, sung: ---
Amazingly glazed and terracotta-ery
I took some clay and made you pottery
The world will never wreck you
I'll protect you in a mother's embrace
--- Unknown ---
Folks say, "Barbara
Why can't you see that ceramics is simply a manifestation of motherly panic
By making a baby that's breakable
Aren't you creating a way of translating the terror of making maternal mistakes into clay
Hiding away so you don't have to face being a bad mom
Barbara
That's what you've done, Barbara
Just make a start
Are you willing to take the next step?
Ready, set-
--- BOTH: ---
Here we stand
At the end of a 10-year plan
A house
A yard
A minivan
A baby should be next
Together let's leap off the cliff
Fall forever, then smash to bits
Trapped in a terrifying viper pit
Of diapers and regret
Are we willing to take the next step?
--- ADAM: ---
Ready, set-
--- BARBARA: ---
Ready, set-
--- ADAM: ---
Not yet
--- BARBARA: ---
Not yet
--- ADAM: ---
Why rush?
--- BARBARA: ---
Why rush?
--- BOTH: ---
Soon enough, our hopes and our dreams will be crushed
--- BARBARA: ---
But not yet!
--- ADAM: ---
But not yet!
--- BARBARA: ---
Not now
--- ADAM: ---
Not now
--- *floorboard creaks* ---
--- ADAM, spoken: ---
Ooohh?
--- *floorboard creaks* ---
--- ADAM, spoken: ---
No!
--- *floorboard creaks* ---
--- ADAM, spoken: ---
See?
We can't start a family in a house with creaky floorboards
--- BARBARA: ---
You are absolutely right
Let's add it to the list
With the cracks in the plaster
--- ADAM: ---
The wi-fi should be faster
--- BARBARA: ---
This sofa needs a castor
--- ADAM: ---
The bathroom's a disaster!
--- BARBARA: ---
What about global poverty?
--- ADAM: ---
What about world peace?
--- BARBARA: ---
Then there's the whole darn economy
--- ADAM: ---
The whole Middle East
--- BARBARA: ---
We should learn Mandarin
--- ADAM: ---
Yeah!
Or Spanish at least.
--- BOTH: ---
No habla espa√±ol
Dos cervezas por favor
--- Unknown ---
And that's all we got
And that's not a lot
Do we want a bilingual household or not?
--- Unknown ---
So let's go slow
No breaking a sweat
What's the point of having children
If we're drowning in debt?
--- BARBARA: ---
Now we're totally
--- ADAM: ---
Completely
--- BARBARA: ---
Maybe eighty percent
--- ADAM: ---
I'd say seventy-eight
--- BOTH (BETELGEUSE): ---
Ready to take
The next step (Yeah! Yeah! Yeah Yeah!)
The next step (Zooby dooby dooby, dooby dop and bow!)
The next step (Zweeby, beeby, boo-bah-bah-dee!)
The next step
Ready, set let's-
Ah!
--- BETELGEUSE: ---
See I wasn't kidding
