------ Day-O (The Banana Boat Song) ------
--- DELIA, spoken: ---
Business friends
I have only known this amazing, amazing man and his unique daughter for a few months
I don't even know how many
I'd have to check my pay stubs
But, as my guru Otho always says-
--- DELIA, sung: ---
Day-O!
--- CHARLES, spoken: ---
What?
--- LYDIA, spoken: ---
What's going on Delia?
Are you alright?
--- DELIA, spoken: ---
Um, I-I am so sorry
I don't-I don't know what just happened
I meant to say-
--- DELIA, sung: ---
Me say day, me say day, me say day, me say day, me say day-o!
--- CHARLES, spoken: ---
Delia?
Do you need to lie down?
--- DELIA, spoken: ---
No! No, I just need to-
--- DELIA, sung: ---
Daylight come and me wanna go home
[*gasping*]
--- DELIA, spoken: ---
What is happening to me?
--- CHARLES, spoken: ---

--- MAXIE, spoken: ---

--- CHARLES, spoken: ---
On behalf of Delia and myself, I'd just like to say-
--- CHARLES, sung: ---
Work all night on a drink of rum
--- ALL, excluding LYDIA: ---

--- LYDIA, spoken: ---
It's like I told you Dad
This house is haunted
And the ghosts who live here
...want you out!
Barbara, the pig!
--- BARBARA, spoken: ---

Please, forgive me!
If I had known-
--- MAXIE, spoken: ---
Chuck, you moron! Don't apologize! We're gonna be rich!
--- CHARLES, spoken: ---
What?
--- LYDIA, spoken: ---
What?
--- MAXIE, spoken: ---
I was never gonna invest in your stupid gated community
But a genuine haunted house?
It's a goldmine!
--- LYDIA, spoken: ---
No!
--- CHARLES, spoken: ---
Do you hear that Delia?
These ghosts are gonna make us a fortune!
--- LYDIA, spoken: ---
No, you're supposed to be scared!
--- ADAM, spoken: ---
Lydia, we're so sorry!
It didn't work!
--- LYDIA, spoken: ---
There's one thing that can still stop him
--- BARBARA, spoken: ---
Lydia, no
You don't know what will happen
--- LYDIA, spoken: ---
I can't keep living like this!
Betelgeuse!
--- BETELGEUSE, spoken: ---
Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy!
I'm so glad you changed your mind
You are never gonna regret this
--- LYDIA, spoken: ---
Betelgeuse...
