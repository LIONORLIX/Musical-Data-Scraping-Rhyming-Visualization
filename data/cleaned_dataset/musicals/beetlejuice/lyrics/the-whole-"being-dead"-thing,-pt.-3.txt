------ The Whole "Being Dead" Thing, Pt. 3 ------
--- BETELGEUSE: ---
Hey guys, awesome seance
Lots of good old-fashioned chaos
You lose — in your faces!
'Cause look who's holding all the aces
--- Unknown ---
Hey, it's great that you ate up my plan
The pooch has been screwed
And shit's hit the fan!
You wanted me gone-
--- LYDIA, spoken: ---
I don't have a choice
--- BETELGEUSE: ---
You wanted your mom-
--- LYDIA, spoken: ---
It's my fault she's dying!
--- BETELGEUSE: ---
You messed with the wrong book — now look what you've done!
