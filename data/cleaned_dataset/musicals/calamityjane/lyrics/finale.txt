--- CALAMITY ---
Now I shout it from the highest hills,
even told the golden daffodils.
At last my heart's an open door,
and my secret love's no secret anymore.
--- KATIE ---
Ain't going back to the windy city,
the windy city is mighty pretty,
but it ain't got what I've got,
I'm telling you boys,
I wouldn't trade this golden nugget
for the whole of Illinois.
--- BILL ---
My heart is higher than a hawk,
my love is deeper than a well,
I'm thinkin' in a little while
my lovin' I'll be doin' very well....
We'll be home tonight by the light of the silvery moon.
--- CALAMITY ---
And my hearts a-thumpin' like a mandolin a-plunkin' a tune.
--- BOTH ---
When we get home we're fixin' to stay,
so whipcrack away, whipcrack away, whipcrack away!
--- CHORUS ---
Oh, the Deadwood stage is a-rollin' on over the plains,
with the curtains flappin' and the driver slappin' the reins.
A beautiful sky!
A wonderful day! Whipcrack away, whipcrack away, whipcrack away!
