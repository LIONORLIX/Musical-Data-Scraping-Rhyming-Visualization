------ Higher Than A Hawk ------
--- Unknown ---
My heart is higher than a hawk
my love is deeper than a well
I'm thinkin' in a little while
My love and I'll be doin' very well
--- Unknown ---
An owl is givin' me the eye
The wind is blowin' me a kiss
I wouldn't be at all surprised
If I were only dreamin' all of this
--- Unknown ---
And when I strut about like a Sunny Jim
Dressed in yeller and red
Folks'll shout, Take a look at him!
He's tetched in the head!
--- Unknown ---
I said that I would never fall
I laughed at others when they fell
And here I'm falling,  higher than a hawk
And deeper than a well
..
And when we're all rigged out like a birthday cake
Eyes'll pop everywhere.
Folks'll shout, Don't you think
they make a wonderful pair?
--- Unknown ---
I said that I would never fall
But if you promise not to tell
My love for you is higher than a hawk
And deeper than a well
