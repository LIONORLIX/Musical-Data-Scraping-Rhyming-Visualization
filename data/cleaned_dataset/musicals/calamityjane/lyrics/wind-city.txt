------ Wind City ------
--- Unknown ---
I just blew in from the windy city
The windy city is mighty purty
But they ain't got what we got, no sirree
They got shacks up to seven storeys
Never see any morning glories
But a step from our doorway
We got 'em fer free
--- Unknown ---
They've got those minstrel shows
Purty ladies in the big chapeaus
Private lawns, public parks
For the sake of civic virtue
They've got fountains there that squirt you
--- Unknown ---
I just blew in from the windy city
The windy city is mighty purty
But they ain't got what we got.
I'm telling you, boys,
We got more life in Deadwood city than in all of Illinois!

On the street was a dancin' feller
All dressed up in a suit of yeller
Aand the dance that he did there
Went somethin' like this...
--- Unknown ---
Whistle! (whistling) More!
--- Unknown ---
(Dance Interlude)
--- Unknown ---
You shoulda seen me a-winder shopping
A-winder shopping with eyes a-poppin'
At the sights that you see there, yes sirree!
--- Unknown ---
Press a bell and a moment later
Up you go in an elevator
Just as fast as a polecat a-climbin' a tree
--- Unknown ---
I heard claim hundreds came
To a thing they call a baseball game!
Cigar stores, revolving doors
Men wear sideburns and they oughter
'Cause a haircut costs a quarter
--- Unknown ---
I just blew in from the windy city,
The windy city is mighty purty
But they ain't got what we got.
I'm tellin' ya, boys
