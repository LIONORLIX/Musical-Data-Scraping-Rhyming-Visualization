------ Hive Full Of Honey ------
--- Unknown ---
I've got two wonderful arms
I've got two wonderful lips
I'm over twenty one, and I'm free!
Oh, I've got a hive full o' honey
For the right kind of honey bee
--- Unknown ---
I'm not the glamorous type
But I'm the amorous type
You'll love the way I fit on your knee.
Oh, I've got a hive full o' honey
for the right kind of honey bee
--- Unknown ---
My daddy owns a railroad
and my ma is a millionaire
and besides I'm an only child
Do you think you could learn to care?
--- Unknown ---
If you're the one I adore
Come on and get it before
Somebody shakes it down from the tree.
I've got a hive full o' honey
For the right kind of honey bee
..
I got two wonderful arms
I got two wonderful lips
I'm over twenty one, and I'm free!
Oh, I've got a hive full o' honey
For the right kind of honey bee!
