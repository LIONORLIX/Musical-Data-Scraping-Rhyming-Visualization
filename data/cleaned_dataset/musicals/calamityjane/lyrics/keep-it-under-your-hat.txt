------ Keep It Under Your Hat ------
--- Unknown ---
Well, now, if you've got a cutie who's a real sweet patootie
better keep it under your hat
Just remember curiousity in fables of old
Killed the curious cat

Supposin' you love a laddie who's a sweet sugar daddy
Better take in the welcoming mat
Remember there's a dozen dolls for every Dan
You're not the only sweet pea in the can
--- Unknown ---
So, if you wanna know the way to keep your man
Keep it under your hat
Keep it under your hat!

If you wanna know the way to keep your man
Keep it under your hat
Keep it under your hat!
--- Unknown ---
Keep it under your hat!
