------ Just Ask Flowers ------
--- AURORA AQUINO ---
When I asked my son
What do you want to be?
I was a little surprised
When he said to me
--- Unknown ---
"I wanna' be a drummer, mom
I wanna' be a drummer
I gotta' call the people, mom
And get 'em all together
--- Unknown ---
I wanna' be a drummer, mom
I wanna' be a drummer
I gotta' call the people, mom
And get 'em all together
--- Unknown ---
Now I watch the procession
As his body goes by
Half the country is here
But they won't see me cry
--- Unknown ---
Ten thousand or more
And they've waited for hours
When I asked why are you here
They said, Just ask the flowers
They said, Just ask the flowers
--- Unknown ---
Yeah just ask the flowers
Tama na, sobra na
We put up with so much
But this is going too far
--- Unknown ---
"I wanna' be a drummer, mom
I wanna' be a drummer
I gotta' call the people, mom
And get 'em all together
--- Unknown ---
I wanna' be a drummer, mom
I wanna' be a drummer
I gotta' call the people, mom
And get 'em all together
--- Unknown ---
It was a hero's procession
Now it's more than one man
And my son was a drummer
This I now understand
--- Unknown ---
That day something was born
In those afternoon showers
And the reason they're here
You need just ask the flowers
--- Unknown ---
Just ask the flowers
Yeah just ask the flowers
Tama na, sobra na
We put up with so much
But this is going too far
--- Unknown ---
"I wanna' be a drummer, mom
I wanna' be a drummer
I gotta' call the people, mom
And get 'em all together
--- Unknown ---
I wanna' be a drummer, mom
I wanna' be a drummer
I gotta' call the people, mom
