------ Dancing Together ------
--- Unknown ---
Went to the house of Mary Lasker
Saw Matisses, Picassos, Renoirs and Gauguins
Golf course and flowers, statues and stables
I met a Whitney, Rockefeller and Brown!
--- Unknown ---
And they were dancin’, dancing together
Dancin’, oh so beautifully
Dancin’, dancing together
Dancin’, oh as if in a dream
--- Unknown ---
Charles Jourdan, Oleg Cassini
There was Andy Warhol and Hanae Mori
Beautiful products all over the table
Fills my heart up with thoughts of my people
--- Unknown ---
And they were dancin’, dancing together...
--- Unknown ---
I love my little people
You don’t know what it’s like
I’d rather be back in my Leyte
Back in the Quonset hut
--- Unknown ---
Ali Hassan, Margot Fonteyn
Christina Onassis and the Queen of Spain
Beautiful women in beautiful homes
Just out of reach if your skin’s colored brown
--- Unknown ---
And they’ll be dancin’, dancing together...

“Hello Mr. Zeibel?
Yes, my name is Jane Ryan—Mr. Saunders
and I would like to make a deposit…”
--- Mm-hmm, now listen ---
Breakfast with George, disco with George
