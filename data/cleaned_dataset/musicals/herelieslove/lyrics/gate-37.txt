------ Gate 37 ------
--- AQUINO ---
So hold me now,
Cory and Benny
You know this thing
It’s bigger than me —
--- Unknown ---
I’ve got to do this alone
So it’ll draw less attention
But it hurts me so much
Now it’s time must leave
--- AQUINO & ENSEMBLE ---
Now you’re all gathered here
Here at Gate 37
Do you know what it means
To be saying goodbye?
--- AQUINO ---
Do you know what it means
That this might be forever?
I might be seeing you now
For the very last time
--- Unknown ---
I can hear the announcement
As they call China Airlines
This bulletproof vest
It’s the best we can do
--- Unknown ---
But the chances are slim
And if the truth it be told
‘Cause if they aim for my head
It won’t do me much good
--- AQUINO & ENSEMBLE ---
Now you’re all gathered here
Here at Gate 37
Do you know what it means
To be saying goodbye?
--- AQUINO ---
Do you know what it means
That this might be forever?
I might be seeing you now
For the very last time
--- AQUINO & ENSEMBLE ---
Now you’re all gathered here
