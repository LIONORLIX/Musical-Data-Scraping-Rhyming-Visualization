------ God Draws Straight ------
--- Unknown ---
As I left my house
As I walked out today
Thought I walked out' my marriage
Thought I walked out on grace
--- Unknown ---
As the dawn it was breaking
At the end of the street
I didn't know what would happen
Didn't know what I'd see
--- Unknown ---
I saw two transit buses
Block the road on our side
Saw a couple of joggers
Who chanced to run by
--- Unknown ---
Saw some soldiers come out
And they mixed with the crowd
Tears came to my eyes
We're just walking around
--- Unknown ---
Well there's so many people
Everybody is here
I saw the girls from the office
I saw those guys from the street
--- Unknown ---
You might think you are lost
But then you will find
That god draws straight
But with crooked lines
--- Unknown ---
I saw a matron in white
Her face lifted to heaven
I saw nuns on their knees
Some who were weeping
--- Unknown ---
Saw a middle-aged man
And a government clerk
An Afro-mestizo
Held his rosary up
--- Unknown ---
I saw nobody leave
I didn't feel fear or terror
It felt like a movie
Like the end of an era
--- Unknown ---
Nobody got hurt
And nobody died
I'll remember this day
I'll remember this time
--- Unknown ---
And there's so many people
Everybody is here
I saw the girls from the office
I saw those guys from the street
--- Unknown ---
You might think you are lost
But then you will find
That god draws straight
But with crooked lines
--- Unknown ---
As I turned on my walkman
And all I could hear
Every station was Marcos
He's on every TV
--- Unknown ---
An appliance store window
He fills every screen
Then the TVs went blank
And his face disappeared
--- Unknown ---
Then the darkness it thickened
There was no time for choices
Half blind I ran
I was guided by voices
--- Unknown ---
When the choppers took off
Leaving Malaca√±ang
We knew it was over
Knew it was the end
--- Unknown ---
And there's so many people
Everybody is here
I saw the girls from the office
The whole country, it seems
--- Unknown ---
You might think you are lost
But then you will find
That god draws straight
But with crooked lines
--- Unknown ---
Yeah god draws straight
