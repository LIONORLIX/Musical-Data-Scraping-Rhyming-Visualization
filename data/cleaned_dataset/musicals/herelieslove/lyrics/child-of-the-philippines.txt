------ Child of the Philippines ------
--- AQUINO ---
[spoken] This song right here is going out
To all my Filipinos going through the struggle
You may feel like nobody sees you,
But Aquino’s got your back
Now listen up:
--- Unknown ---
[sung] Once upon a time I was a
Little prince
Anything I wanted
Anything I wished
But money can burn you
And it won’t set you free.
Though my friends stuck around
Hey!
I knew that I had to leave
--- Unknown ---
All around the land, I see
Hatred and fear
Where is the kindness?
Where now, my dear?
Can our country be healed?
Can it change and be strong?
Will the answers come soon?
Ha!
We have waited so long.
Now listen up:
--- Unknown ---
I am a child of the Philippines
From Kabayan to Lake Cebu
And I —
I’m a young man
A young man in a hurry
--- Unknown ---
But you
You know that those miracles
You know that those miracles
You know that those miracles
They might —
Come true
--- AQUINO ---
[spoken] I see you, Imelda!
--- IMELDA ---
Hey, Aquino!
--- AQUINO ---
Girl, you better bring that pretty face over here
‘Cause you make me wanna
You make me wanna...
--- Unknown ---
[sung] Dream a little dream
With a girl just like you.
--- IMELDA ---
It’s not a dream
And you know that it’s good
--- AQUINO ---
Now when you walked in the room
I just had to say yeah —
And with you by my side
I know we’ll go far
--- IMELDA ---
Anything you want
Everything you do
Love is gonna change
The bad into good
--- AQUINO ---
But we have waited so long
Now a change will come soon
And if you put me in charge
Hey!
That’s what I’ll do
--- Unknown ---
[spoken] Help me out fellas…
--- ALL ---
[sung] I am a child of the Philippines
From Kabayan to Lake Cebu
--- AQUINO ---
And this —
This is our land.
A land that’s in a hurry.
--- Unknown ---
But you
You know that those miracles,
You know that those miracles,
You know that those miracles,
They might —
Come true.
--- Unknown ---
[spoken] I think they can come true.
We can educate our children!
We can unionize our workers.
We can
Give our people a break.
Come on, let’s give our people a break!
You say!
--- ALL ---
Give our people a break.
--- AQUINO ---
Come on, let’s give our people a break!
Let me hear it!
--- ALL ---
Give our people a break.
--- AQUINO ---
Let me hear it!
Give our people a break.
You say!
--- ALL ---
Give our people a break.
--- AQUINO ---
Just give them a break.
Yeah!
