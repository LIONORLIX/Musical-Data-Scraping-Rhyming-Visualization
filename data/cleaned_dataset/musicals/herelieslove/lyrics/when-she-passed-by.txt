------ When She Passed By ------
--- Unknown ---
I heard that you were getting married
I always knew that you’d do well
You’re a legendary beauty
From our small provincial town
--- Unknown ---
Ilocos joined to Leyte
Two important families
A glorious occasion
A foretold destiny
--- Unknown ---
I followed in the morning papers
How exciting it has been
The courtship and the whirlwind romance
For the sweetest of beauty queens
--- Unknown ---
He’s crazy for you
Who wouldn’t be, I’m sure
And nothing matters more than that
And you’ll never be poor no more—
--- Unknown ---
How she looked when she passed by
How she looked when she passed by
I feel like I’m watching history
Living before my eyes
Many years from now
We’ll recall just how
How she looked when she passed by
--- Unknown ---
I know that you are in there somewhere
Letters get misplaced in the mail
Guess that there was some confusion
Amidst those throngs and swells
--- Unknown ---
Did you see me outside?
Did you see me wave?
When you passed in your car
Ah well, that’s okay—
--- Unknown ---
How she looked when she passed by
How she looked when she passed by
Feel like I’m watching history
Living before my eyes
Many years from now
We’ll recall just how
