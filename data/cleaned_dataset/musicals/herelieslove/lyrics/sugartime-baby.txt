------ Sugartime Baby ------
--- IMELDA ---
People ask me
How we started
I tell them it's true
--- Unknown ---
I was just a
Simple salesgirl
When I ran into you
--- MARCOS ---
I took one look at you
Sitting there with your friends
Had I seen you before?
Now my whole life is changed
--- IMELDA AND MARCOS ---
Now I'm walking on air
Through these tropical streets
We're from different worlds
Love has power to heal
--- Unknown ---
Sugartime baby, honeymoon
Lucky for me, crazy for you
Puffy white clouds both near and far
Flowers exploding in my heart
--- Unknown ---
You never know
Where love is found
God only knows
Where we are bound
--- Unknown ---
Wo-hoo wo-hoo wo-hoo
Wo-hoo wo-hoo wo-hoo
--- JEIGH MADJUS ---
What a picture they make
I'm so proud of us all
--- ENSEMBLE ---
And the whole can see
They're our Jackie and John
--- Unknown ---
Now the man from the North
And the Tacloban Rose
Make a beautiful dream
And how far they will go!
--- IMELDA AND MARCOS ---
Sugartime baby, honeymoon
Lucky for me, crazy for you
Puffy white clouds both near and far
Flowers exploding in my heart
--- Unknown ---
You never know
Where love is found
God only knows
Where we are bound

Wo-hoo wo-hoo wo-hoo
