------ Don't You Agree? ------
--- Unknown ---
With my heart and with my skin
From town to town and back again
With my skin and with my soul
How each one smiles when he’s alone
--- Unknown ---
And here we are—convention center
Traveled so far—crossed many rivers
No time to rest—no time to sleep
Keep movin’ on—my tired feet
--- Unknown ---
Sometimes we need a hero
Can’t make it on our own
Sometimes you need a strongman
When things are out of control
--- Unknown ---
Don’t you agree? Agree with me
Don’t you agree? Don’t you agree?
Don’t you agree? Agree with me
Don’t you agree? Don’t you agree?
--- Unknown ---
Who needs a chair? Whose roof has leaks?
Their children’s names, what each one needs
Got my people ev’rywhere
The bellboys and the operators
--- Unknown ---
Now, who stood up to the Japanese?
Who cares about the Philippines?
He’ll build a house—I’ll decorate
I’m telling all you delegates
--- Unknown ---
Don’t you agree? Agree with me
Don’t you agree? Don’t you agree?
Don’t you agree? Agree with me
Don’t you agree? Don’t you agree?
--- Unknown ---
Sometimes we need a hero
Can’t make it on our own
Sometimes you need a strongman
