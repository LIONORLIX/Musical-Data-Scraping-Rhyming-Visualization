------ Pretty Face ------
--- Unknown ---
Will you reach—into your pockets?
And show us that you care
For the orphans, and the farmers
Ev’ryone give their share
--- Unknown ---
I feel so guilty, when I’m resting
Though I rise at early dawn
For ev’ry hour that passes
I could have helped someone
--- Unknown ---
And we’ll show the world
What a country girl can change
And we’ll show the whole wide world
That we have a pretty face
--- Unknown ---
Pretty face, pretty face, pretty face have we
Pretty face, pretty face, pretty face have we
--- Unknown ---
A thousand miles of concrete
Schools and dams and parks
Two thousand day care centers
And a center for the arts
--- Unknown ---
There will always be poor people
Got to teach them how to care
If a hospital is needed
Ev’ry business give its share
--- Unknown ---
And we’ll show the world
What a country girl can change
And we’ll show the whole wide world
That we have a pretty face
--- Unknown ---
Pretty face, pretty face, pretty face have we
Pretty face, pretty face, pretty face have we
--- Unknown ---
Some would call me Robin Hood
But this work we do I know is good
So dig a little deeper now
We’re gonna turn this thing around
--- Unknown ---
Pretty face, pretty face, pretty face have we
