------ Solano Avenue ------
--- Unknown ---
What did I do to make you mad?
I swear I only told the truth
And none of this could hurt you now
And it’s no insult to be poor
--- Unknown ---
So take back—all your money
Although I need it—more than you
Just acknowledge—that you knew me
On Solano Avenue—oohh
--- Unknown ---
I didn’t mean you any harm
I didn’t mean to bring you shame
It’s not a sin that we had nothing
You and I were not to blame
--- Unknown ---
When they teased you on the street
When they hurt you deep inside
To me it was—that you came running
And I held you when you cried
--- Unknown ---
So take back—all your money
Although I need it—more than you
Just acknowledge—that you knew me
