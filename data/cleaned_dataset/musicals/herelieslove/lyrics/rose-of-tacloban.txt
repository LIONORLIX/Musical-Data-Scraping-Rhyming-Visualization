------ Rose of Tacloban ------
--- Unknown ---
I wrote inside my yearbook
“To try is to succeed
Fried chicken and the rumba
The colors pink and cream”
--- Unknown ---
Ninoy was my first love
But he said I was too tall
A rich girl stole the sweetheart
Of the Rose of Tacloban
--- Unknown ---
The heart grows slightly colder
Necessary to survive
And money makes it easy
In many people’s lives
--- Unknown ---
The sky above protects us
Don’t know what I will become
Or what lies beyond tomorrow
For the Rose of Tacloban
--- Unknown ---
Elegant women on a magazine page
Elegant women, like a paper parade
I don’t go out dancing, I just stay at home
Cutting out their faces, and replacing them with my own
Cutting out their faces, and replacing them with my own
--- Unknown ---
The sky above protects us
Don’t know what I will become
Or what lies beyond tomorrow
For the Rose of Tacloban
What lies beyond tomorrow for the Rose—
Of Tacloban
