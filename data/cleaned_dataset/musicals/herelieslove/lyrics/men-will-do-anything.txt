------ Men Will Do Anything ------
--- Unknown ---
You play around with that woman
Didn’t you know I cared?
Walking ’round, ev’ryone can see
A sleazy cheap affair
--- Unknown ---
What’s the matter with me baby?
Am I not good enough for you?
If you prefer that slut—okay
I’ll tell you what we’ll do
--- Unknown ---
Men will do anything
For a little piece of mind
Men will do anything
That’s how you keep them in line
Men will do anything
For some sweet tranquility
Men—will do anything
And there’s nothing you can do to me
--- Unknown ---
Do anything that you want them to
If you leave them on their own
They’ll sign here on the dotted line
If you ignore what they have done
--- Unknown ---
Like a poor little mangy puppy
With his tail between his legs
If you catch them fooling around
Outside the mosquito net
--- Unknown ---
Men will do anything
For a little piece of mind
Men will do anything
That’s how you keep them in line
Men will do anything
For some sweet tranquility
Men—they’ll do anything
