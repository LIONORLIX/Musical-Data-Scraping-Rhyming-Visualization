------ Eleven Days ------
--- Unknown ---
He’s so fast, tell me what’s his name?
It was only a moment, but I don’t feel the same
--- Unknown ---
He gave me—two roses
He gave me—two roses
One is open
One is closed
One is the future
And—one is my love—
--- Unknown ---
Eleven days—since the moment we met
Eleven days—I will never forget
Eleven diamonds—on the ring that he gave
I haven’t seen him—in
Eleven days
Eleven days
Eleven days
Eleven days
--- Unknown ---
What am I doin’?—must be out of my mind
He pulled out the paper and I signed on the line
--- Unknown ---
He gave me—two roses
He gave me—two roses
One is open
One is closed
One is the future
And—one is my love—
--- Unknown ---
Eleven days—since the moment we met
Eleven days—I will never forget
Eleven diamonds—on the ring that he gave
I haven’t seen him—in
Eleven days
Eleven days
Eleven days
Eleven days
