------ Here Lies Love ------
--- Unknown ---
When I was a young girl in Leyte
My dresses were all hand-me-downs and scraps
I’d see the people smile, when I would sing for them
How happy they all seemed—when I would dance
--- Unknown ---
We lived a stone’s throw from the palace
A simple country girl who had a dream
The ladies passing by, a better class than I
How much it meant to me to be like these
--- Unknown ---
Is it a sin to love too much?
Is it a sin to care?
I do it all for you
How can it be unfair?
--- Unknown ---
I know that when my number’s up
When I am called by God above
Don’t have my name inscribed into the stone
Just say:
Here lies love…here lies love…here lies love—
Just say:
Here lies love…here lies love…here lies love—
--- Unknown ---
The most important things are love and beauty
It doesn’t matter if you’re rich or poor
To prosper and to fly, a basic human right
The feeling in your heart that you’re secure
--- Unknown ---
Is it a sin to love too much?
Is it a sin to care?
I do it all for you
How can it be unfair?
I know that when my number’s up
When I am called by God above
Don’t have my name inscribed into the stone
Just say:
Here lies love…here lies love…here lies love—
Just say:
Here lies love…here lies love…here lies love—
