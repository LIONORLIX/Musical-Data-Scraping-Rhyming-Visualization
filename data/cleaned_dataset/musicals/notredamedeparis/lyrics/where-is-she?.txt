------ Where Is She? ------
--- Frollo ---
Gringoire where has your lady gone?
I never see her dance at Notre Dame.
--- Gringoire ---
I don't really know where she has gone,
Priests and poets are not one.
In women I see love;
The church puts them below and my poems above.
--- Frollo ---
Where is she, your Esmeralda?
The small Paris streets can't sing without her song.
--- Gringoire ---
She's alone in a tower of stone,
Far from those who fear all her powers unknown.
--- Frollo ---
Poet what do you say, is it this or that way?
Do not use your words to play, have you seen her today?
--- Clopin ---
Where is she my Esmeralda?
The kingdom I rule has lost all its splendour.
--- Gringoire ---
She is like a swallow of spring,
That someone has caught and tied down the wings.
--- Unknown ---
She is there in the prison called la-Sonte.
If she can't get away that is where she will stay,
Until she is hung.
--- Clopin ---
You need tell me no more.
--- Frollo, Clopin & Gringoire ---
Where is she your Esmeralda?
The small Paris streets can't sing without her song.
She is like a swallow of spring,
