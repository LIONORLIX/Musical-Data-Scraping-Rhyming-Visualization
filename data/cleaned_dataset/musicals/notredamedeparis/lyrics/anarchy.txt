------ Anarchy ------
--- Frollo ---
Who is that girl who dares to dance her evil dance before Notre dame?
--- Gringoire ---
That girl is my wife; she was given to me by the king of a tribe.
--- Frollo ---
Did you touch the girl, you creature of sin?
--- Gringoire ---
She never let me near.
--- Frollo ---
Don't touch her you hear.
--- Gringoire ---
Father do you recall, this word carved on the wall.
--- Gringoire ---
Do you know what this word means, this word anarchy?
--- Frollo ---
Why do you bother me, the Greek anarchy means destiny.
--- Gringoire ---
Is that Quasimodo, those men have led away?
