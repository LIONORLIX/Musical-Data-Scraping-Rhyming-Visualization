------ Frollo's Visit To Esmeralda ------
--- Frollo ---
I'm your priest and I've come to prepare you to die.
--- Esmeralda ---
I'm cold, I'm weak; can't you let me go? I've done nothing to anyone.
--- Frollo ---
The clock is striking five; it means that dawn will come soon.
Very soon they'll unlock that door, very soon you will be no more.
--- Esmeralda ---
Very soon I'll find happiness.
--- Frollo ---
Will you still sing when you're bound, and dance at the hanging ground?
--- Esmeralda ---
What have I done to you that you hate me through and through?
--- Frollo ---
It is not that I hate, it is that I love you. I love!
--- Esmeralda ---
What is it I have done, a gypsy girl alone?
That love for me has come to you the priest of Notre dame.
