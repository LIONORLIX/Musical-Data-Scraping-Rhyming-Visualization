Soldiers of the king I order you to break down that door. (Asylum)
Your conscience and your soul will remain safe and whole. (Asylum)
I give you the right, to transcend the right of asylum.
--- Phoebus and soldiers ---
(Down with these refugees.
Down with these beggar thieves.
Down with them all.)
--- Clopin & Refugees ---
We are the strangers here, the refugees the women and men.
Without a home, Oh Notre dame we come and ask of you.
Asylum. Asylum.

--- Clopin ---
Esmeralda I die, oh sister do not cry
For all your people here.
Please listen to my prayer
This country is where you've grown.
This country is your own.
Claim it with all your might, for me Esmeralda.
--- Esmeralda & Refugees ---
We are the strangers here, the refugees the women and men.
Without a home.
--- Gringoire ---
At Paris gates they stand.
Ten thousand in their band.
And one day soon they'll be.
A million in this land.
The world will change someday
And things will go our way
We wonder what you'll do.
The day we ask of you.
--- All ---
Oh Notre Dame we come and ask of you.
Asylum.
