------ Pagan Ave Maria ------
--- Esmeralda ---
Ave maria, please pardon me.
If in your house I come stealing.
Ave maria, no one ever taught me about kneeling.
Ave maria, please will you keep me.
From this misery madness and fools.
Who rule this evil world.
--- Unknown ---
Ave maria, I'm a stranger and you're my last recourse.
Ave maria, please can't you hear me.
Please take down all these walls between us.
We all should be as one.
--- Unknown ---
Ave maria, please watch over my life night and day.
Ave maria, Oh please protect me.
Please guard me and my love now I pray.
