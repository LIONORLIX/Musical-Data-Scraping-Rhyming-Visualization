------ The Shadow ------
--- Phoebus ---
Who follows me?
Is it my shadow drained of light is it a phantom of the night.
My shadow grows.
His druid's hat obscures his face, a long black cape around him falls.
Say who you are, show who you are.
Come here to me, so I can see!
--- Frollo ---
Your conscience follows you, listen to me.
For else I will see you hanged before you're through.
Soldier come near!
Just go from here there's more to fear than to your eyes it may appear.
--- Phoebus ---
I am a soldier sir, I serve the king.
But here that does not mean, anything.
And are you not a man of god?
