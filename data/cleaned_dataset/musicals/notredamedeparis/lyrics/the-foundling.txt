------ The Foundling ------
--- Quasimodo ---
You who gathered me in, kept me close as your kin.
You who heard me cry, abandoned to die.
By those who will not stay, having brought today; A monster.
You who watched while I grew, my suffering you knew.
You who always stood guard, when the world was so hard.
And the greatest of things, you let me be him who rings; The bells.
But you who taught me so much, to speak and read and write.
I never can catch sight, of your thoughts in the light.
A dog obeys his master's call, whatever you say I will do it all.
A dog obeys his master's call, whatever you say, I will do it all.
