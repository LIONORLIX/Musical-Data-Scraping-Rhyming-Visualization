------ The King Of Fools ------
--- Quasimodo ---
Little girls, don't come laughing in my tracks.
On this day you can't attack, Quasimodo the hunchback.
The people choose, the king of fools.
We celebrate today, the festival of kings.
And for today they say I can have anything.
Will you love me, Esmeralda?
Will you love me?
But I won't do, Esmeralda.
I'm not for you, you look right through.
The king of fools.
The king of fools.
