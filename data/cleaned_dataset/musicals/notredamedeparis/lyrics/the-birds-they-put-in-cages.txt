------ The Birds They Put in Cages ------
--- Esmeralda ---
Will the birds they put in cages, ever ride upon the wind?
Will the children life outrages, ever learn to love again?
I lived my life like a swallow; I arrived here in the springtime.
All the little streets I'd follow, all the gypsy songs were mine.
Where's my friend who rings the church bells?
Where are you my Quasimodo?
They will hang me as the light swells, you can break these bars I know.
--- Quasimodo ---
Esmeralda have you left me? Do you hide yourself away?
I have counted every hour; I have missed you every day.
Have you left upon a journey, with your handsome shining soldier?
With no marriage taking love free, like the gypsy girl you are.
Have you died out in the small streets, with no prayer to get to heaven?
There's a priest who counts your heartbeat, if he comes near you must run.
--- Esmeralda ---
You remember at the street fair.
--- Quasimodo ---
When they hurt me on the great wheel.
--- Esmeralda ---
When you begged I gave you water.
--- Quasimodo ---
At your feet I had to kneel.
--- Quasimodo & Esmeralda ---
On that day our friendship started, it will last as long as we live.
Once together never parted, all we'll have to give we'll give.
--- Unknown ---
Will the birds they put in cages, ever ride upon the wind.
Will the children life outrages, ever learn to love again?
