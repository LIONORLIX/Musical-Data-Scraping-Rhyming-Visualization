------ My Heart If You Will Swear ------
--- Fleur-de-Lys ---
You ride so high and straight and fair.
You look like you belong there.
So strong and right and four square.
No other man can compare
Or maybe you don't really care.
Just look for pleasure out there.
And always get your share.
Is there a heart in you somewhere?
--- Unknown ---
My heart is pure my heart is rare.
If you are hurt I'll be there.
We'll start again from nowhere.
You'll have my heart if you will swear.
You'll have my heart if you will swear.
That you will hang Esmeralda.
I'm not a little girl now.
I'll show you that I know how.
I'll show you how I can be.
You think that I am so pure.
I tell you don't be so sure.
I can be wild and free.
--- Unknown ---
Your words of love are hard to bear.
Your promises are thin air.
My heart is hard and I don't care.
I'll leave you hanging out there.
Unloose my belt let down my hair.
Come take me if you still dare.
Your love is all I want to wear.
You'll have my heart if you will swear.
You'll have my heart if you will swear.
That you will hang Esmeralda.
--- Unknown ---
You'll have my heart if you will swear.
You'll have my heart if you will swear.
That you will hang Esmeralda.
