------ Talk To Me Of Florence ------
--- Frollo ---
Talk to me of Florence, and of the renaissance.
And of Bramante tell and of great Dante's hell.
--- Gringoire ---
In Florence they have found, that the world is really round.
And there's a new unknown, continent to be found
--- Gringoire ---
They tell me ships have sailed, upon the open sea.
For new ways to the East, where ever they may be.
--- Frollo ---
Luther will give the world, the true New Testament.
The old world falls apart, mankind learns discontent.
--- Gringoire ---
And Gutenberg with his books will change the world again.
--- Frollo ---
In Nuremberg on his press, books pour forth, day out day in.
--- Gringoire ---
Novels poems and songs, men can read of right and wrong.
--- Frollo & Gringoire ---
New ideas come along, who knows where we belong.
--- Gringoire ---
The little things all come, with great things to descend.
The little words are strong, they bring down monuments.
--- Frollo ---
The books they read in school, will kill cathedrals all.
The bible kills the church, and man will make god fall.
The new will kill the old.
--- Frollo & Gringoire ---
They tell me ships have sailed, upon the ocean sea.
For new ways to the east, wherever they may be.
Luther will give the world, the true New Testament.
The old world falls apart, mankind learns discontent.
The new will kill the old.
