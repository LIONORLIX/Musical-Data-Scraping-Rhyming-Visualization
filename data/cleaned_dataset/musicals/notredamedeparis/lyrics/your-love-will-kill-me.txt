------ Your Love Will Kill Me ------
--- Frollo ---
I feel a wave of passion, move through my heart with such pain.
I have no time for reason, so I just let passion reign.
I let go so easily, on a night as warm as sin.
Midnight swimmer, midnight sea I will not come back again.
--- Unknown ---
Your love will kill me; your love will kill me.
And you will bear my curse as long as my life will be
--- Unknown ---
Your love will kill me.
Your love will kill me.
Your love will kill me.
--- Unknown ---
My sin and my obsession, crazy desire you bring.
I know there's no salvation, I see our bodies burning.
Your gypsy dreams all haunt me, I live to see your dances.
Please raise your eyes and want me, please give me all the chances.
--- Unknown ---
Your love will kill me; your love will kill me.
And I saw it would be when I looked at you when you looked at me.
--- Unknown ---
Your love will kill me.
Your love will kill me.
Your love will kill me.
--- Unknown ---
You brought the springtime to fill, my heart in it's winter chill.
I lost my strength and my will, and now my tears start to spill.
I never knew such desire, just looking into your eyes.
And now the soul in me cries, and now the night is on fire.
--- Unknown ---
Your love will kill me; your love will kill me.
And you will bear my curse as long as my life will be
--- Unknown ---
Your love will kill me; your love will kill me.
And I saw it would be when I looked at you when you looked at me.
--- Unknown ---
Your love will kill me.
Your love will kill me.
Your love will kill me.
--- Unknown ---
Your love will kill me.
