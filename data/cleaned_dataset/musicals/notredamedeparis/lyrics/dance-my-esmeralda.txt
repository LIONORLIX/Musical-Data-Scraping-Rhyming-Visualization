------ Dance My Esmeralda ------
--- Quasimodo ---
When the years have all come and gone.
They'll find beneath the ground.
Our two bodies joined as one.
Showing how we were bound.
How much Quasimodo once loved.
Esmeralda the gypsy girl.
How he was marked by god above.
Just to help him to bear his cross.
Just to help him to bear his cross.
Eat my body and drink my blood.
Vultures of Montfaucon.
So that death more than this life could.
Join our two names as one.
Let my poor soul just fly away.
From the miseries of this earth.
Let my love find the light of day.
In the light of the universe.
In the light of the universe.

Dance my Esmeralda, sing my Esmeralda.
Dance just one more time for me.
You know I'll die for love of you.
Dance my Esmeralda, sing my Esmeralda.
Please let my poor soul fly free.
It is not death to die for you.

Dance my Esmeralda, sing my Esmeralda.
Please come sleep here in my arms.
You know I'd die for love of you.
Dance my Esmeralda, sing my Esmeralda.
Beyond, and beyond beyond.
It is not death to die for you.
--- Unknown ---
Dance my Esmeralda, sing my Esmeralda.
Please let my poor soul fly free.
