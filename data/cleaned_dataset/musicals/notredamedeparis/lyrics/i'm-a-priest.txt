------ I'm a Priest ------
--- Frollo ---
I was a happy man, until I saw her face.
I hid my need away in some dark secret place.
All that power of sex, I kept down and I never let go.
I had only one design the truth of god and man to know.
--- Unknown ---
Oh, I'm a priest and I love this girl.
I love with a love that destroys my world.
--- Unknown ---
Against the wind and the tide I could stand any shock.
Straight and proud like Notre dame upon her rock.
I let no woman near I suffered for gods care.
In the heart of the night I saw the lightning flare.
--- Unknown ---
Oh, I'm a priest and I love this girl.
I love, yes I love; with a love that destroys my world.
Oh I'm a priest and I love this girl.
--- Unknown ---
Heal me with your touch or hurt me once again.
Make me suffer for my sin.
Just lead me onto hell and I'll deny my Christ.
For hell with you is paradise.
--- Unknown ---
Oh, I'm a priest and I love this girl.
I love, yes I love; with a love that destroys my world.
Oh I'm a priest and I love this girl.
