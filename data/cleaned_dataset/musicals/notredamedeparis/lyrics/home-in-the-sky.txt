------ Home In The Sky ------
--- Quasimodo ---
These gargoyles my friends, watch over you.
They will keep you safe, from all the harm men do.
If you need a place you can come to.
Ask asylum of us, we'll take care of you.
Here in my home so high, the weather's always nice.
Where summers pass us by, we're safe from winter's ice.
Notre dame de Paris, it's my home in the sky.
Where I think about why, we must live and must die.
--- Esmeralda ---
These gargoyles your friends, now they are my friends too.
It's they who make me laugh, the days I can't get through.
Sometimes they make me happy, they look just like you.
Though your face frightens me no matter what I do.
--- Quasimodo ---
Notre dame de Paris, it is all part of me.
It's my world where I'm free, where I'm happy to be.
When you need a place you can come to.
Ask asylum of us, we'll take care of you.
--- Quasimodo & Esmeralda ---
Here in my home so high, the weather's always nice.
Where summers pass us by, we're safe from winter's ice.
If you're wondering still, summer winter you'll come.
--- (Esmeralda ---
I'll come)
--- Unknown ---
And my home if you will.
--- (Esmeralda ---
And your home if I will).
--- Unknown ---
You can call it your home.
