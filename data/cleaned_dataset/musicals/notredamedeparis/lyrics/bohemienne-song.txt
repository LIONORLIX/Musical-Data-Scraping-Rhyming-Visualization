------ Bohemienne Song ------
--- Unknown ---
Bohemienne.
No one knows where my story begins.
Bohemienne.
I was born on a road that bends.
Bohemienne, bohemienne.
Come tomorrow, I'll wander again.
Bohemienne, bohemienne.
Here's my fate in the lines of my hand.
--- Unknown ---
When I was a child in Provence, Bare foot in the hills I danced once.
But the gypsy road is so long, the roads so long.
Everyday I see a new chance, maybe some road will lead from France.
I will follow till I come home, Till I come home.
--- Unknown ---
Andalusia's streams, run through my blood, run through my daydreams.
Andalusia's sky, when it calls me, I feel my heart fly.
--- Unknown ---
Bohemienne.
No one knows where my story begins.
Bohemienne.
I was born on a road that bends.
Bohemienne, bohemienne.
Come tomorrow I'll wander again.
Bohemienne, bohemienne.
Here's my fate in the lines of my hand.
