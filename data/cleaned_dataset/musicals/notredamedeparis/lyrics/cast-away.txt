------ Cast Away ------
--- Clopin & Refugees ---
Cast away, souls at bay.
It's our dreams, they betray.
Now they say we can't stay.
Prayers we pray lost today.
Put the shade of your skin.
With the shade of my skin.
Put the song that you sing.
With the dance that I bring.
Refugees, downward bound.
Fill the streets of your town.
--- Unknown ---
Can't we make a world, to which everyone belongs?
Can't we make a world, without fears without frontiers?
--- Unknown ---
We're called names we are blamed.
We're kept down we are shamed.
In the night torture comes.
Try to speak without tongues.
My homeland I hold here
In my heart ever near.
In your land I find tears.
Words that hurt things to fear.
In my heart summer dies.
From your grey winter skies.

Can't we make a world, to which everyone belongs?
Can't we make a world, without fears without frontiers?
--- Unknown ---
Cast away, souls at bay.
It's our dreams, they betray.
Now they say we can't stay.
Prayers we pray lost today.
Cast away.
Cast away.
