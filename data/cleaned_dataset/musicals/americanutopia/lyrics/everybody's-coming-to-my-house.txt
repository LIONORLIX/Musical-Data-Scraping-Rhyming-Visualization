------ Everybody's Coming to My House ------
--- Unknown ---
I wish I was a camera
I wish I was a postcard
I welcome you to my house
You didn't have to go far
A house and a garden
There are, there's plants and trees
Make a, a closer inspection
If you get, get?down on your knees
--- Unknown ---
Now everybody's coming to my house
And I'm never gonna ?be alone
And everybody's coming to my house
And they're never gonna go back home
--- Unknown ---
I'm pointing and describing
And I can be your guide
The skin is just a roadmap
The view is very nice
Imagine looking at a picture
Imagine driving in a car
Imagine rolling down the window
Imagine opening the door
--- Unknown ---
Everybody's coming to my house
Everybody's coming to my house
I'm never gonna be alone
And they're never gonna go back home
--- Unknown ---
We're only tourists in this life
Only tourists but the view is nice
And we're never gonna go back home
No we're never gonna go back home (all right)
We're only tourists in this life
Only tourists but the view is nice
--- Unknown ---
Now everybody's coming to my house
And I'm never gonna?be alone
And everybody's coming to my house
And they're never gonna go back home
--- Unknown ---
Everybody's coming to my house
Everybody's coming to my house
I'm never gonna be alone
