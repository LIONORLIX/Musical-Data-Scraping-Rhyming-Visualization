------ Glass, Concrete & Stone ------
--- Unknown ---
Now, I'm waking at the crack of dawn
To send a little money home
From here to the moon
--- Unknown ---
Is rising like a discotheque
And now my bags are down and packed
For traveling
--- Unknown ---
Looking at happiness
Keeping my flavor fresh
Nobody knows I guess
How far I'll go, I know, so I'm
--- Unknown ---
Leaving at six o' Clock
Meet in a parking lot
Harriet Hendershot
Sunglasses on she waits by this
--- Unknown ---
Glass and concrete and stone
It is just a house, not a home
--- Unknown ---
Skin that covers me from head to toe
Except a couple tiny holes
And openings
--- Unknown ---
Where the city's blowing in and out
And this is what it's all about
Delightfully
--- Unknown ---
Everything's possible
When you're an animal
Not inconceivable
How things can change, I know, so I'm
--- Unknown ---
Putting on aftershave
Nothing is out of place
Gonna be on my way
Try to pretend it's not only
--- Unknown ---
Glass and concrete and stone
That it's just a house, not a home
--- Unknown ---
And it's glass and concrete and stone
It is just a house, not a home
And my head is fifty feet high
Let my body and soul be my guide
