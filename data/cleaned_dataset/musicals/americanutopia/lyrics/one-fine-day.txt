------ One Fine Day ------
--- Unknown ---
Saw the wandrin' eye inside my heart
Shouts and battle cries from ev'ry part
I can see those tears ev'ry one is true
When the door appears I'll go right through, ooh
--- Unknown ---
I stand in liquid light like ev'ryone
I built my life with rhymes to carry on
And it gives me hope to see you there
The things I used to know that one fine
--- Unknown ---
One fine day
One fine day
--- Unknown ---
In a small dark room where I will wait
Face to face I find I contemplate
Even though a man is made of clay
Ev'rything can change one fine
--- Unknown ---
One Fine Day...
--- Unknown ---
Then before my eyes-Is standing still
I beheld it there a city on a hill
I complete my tasks one by one
I remove my masks when I am done
--- Unknown ---
Then a peace of mind fell over me
In these troubled times I still can see
We can use the stars to guide the way
It is not that far one fine...
--- Unknown ---
One fine day
