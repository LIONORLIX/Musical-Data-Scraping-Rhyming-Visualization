------ Bullet ------
--- Unknown ---
The bullet went into him
His skin did part in two
Skin that women had touched
The bullet passed on through
--- Unknown ---
The bullet went into him
It went its merry way
Like an old grey dog
On a fox's trail
--- Unknown ---
The bullet went into him
His stomach filled with food
Many fine meals he tasted there
But the bullet passed on through
--- Unknown ---
The bullet went into him
It went its merry way
Like an old grey dog
On a fox's trail
--- Unknown ---
The bullet went into him
Through his heart with thoughts of you
Where your kisses he inhaled
The lies and the truth
--- Unknown ---
The bullet went into him
Traveled up into his head
Through thoughts of love and hate
The living and the dead
--- Unknown ---
The bullet went into him
It went its merry way
Like an old grey dog
