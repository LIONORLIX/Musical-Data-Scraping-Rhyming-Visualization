------ Slippery People ------
--- Unknown ---
What about the time?
You were rollin' over
Fall on your face
You must be having fun
Walk lightly
Think of a time
You'd best believe
This thing is real
Put away that gun
This part is simple
Try to recognize
What is in your mind?
God help us
Help us lose our minds
These slippery people
Help us understand
What's the matter with him? (He's alright)
I'll see his face (the Lord won't mind)
Don't play no games (he's alright)
Love from the bottom to the top
Turn like a wheel (he's alright)
See for yourself (the Lord won't mind)
We're gonna move (right now)
Turn like a wheel inside a wheel
I remember when
Sittin' in the tub
Pulled out the plug
The water was runnin' out
Cool down
Stop actin' crazy
They're gonna leave
And we'll be on our own
Seven times five
They were living creatures
Watch 'em come to life
Right before your eyes
Backslidin'
How do you do?
These slippery people
Gonna see you through
What's the matter with him? (He's alright)
How do you know? (The Lord won't mind)
Don't throw him no games (he's alright)
Love from the bottom to the top
Turn like a wheel (he's alright)
See for yourself (the Lord won't mind)
We're gonna move (right now)
Turn like a wheel inside a wheel
What's the matter with him? (He's alright)
I'll see his face (the Lord won't mind)
How do you know? (He's alright)
Love from the bottom to the top
Turn like a wheel (he's alright)
See for yourself (the Lord won't mind)
We're gonna move (right now)
Turn like a wheel inside a wheel
What's the matter with him? (He's alright)
I'll see his face (The lord won't mind)
How do you know? (He's alright)
Love from the bottom to the top
Turn like a wheel (he's alright)
See for yourself (the Lord won't mind)
We're gonna move (right now)
Turn like a wheel inside a wheel
