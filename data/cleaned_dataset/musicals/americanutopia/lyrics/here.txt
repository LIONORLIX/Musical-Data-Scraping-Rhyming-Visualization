--- Unknown ---
Here is a region of abundant details
Here is a region that is seldom used
Here is a region that continues living
Even when the other sections are removed
--- Unknown ---
Put your hand out of your pocket
Wipe the sweat off of your brow
Now it feels like a bad connection
No more information now
--- Unknown ---
As it passes through your neurons
Like a whisper in the dark
Raise your eyes to the one who loves you
It is safe right where you are
--- Unknown ---
Here is an area
Of great confusion
Here is a section
That's extremely precise
--- Unknown ---
And here is an area
That needs attention
Here is a connection
With an opposite side
--- Unknown ---
Here is many sounds
For your brain to comprehend
Here the sound is organised
Into things that make some sense
--- Unknown ---
Here there is something
We call hallucination
