--- Unknown ---
Climb aboard!
--- Unknown ---
Hop right in, me ducky!
--- Unknown ---
Let’s get you where you’re going.
--- Unknown ---
You’ve all seen the airport. Used to be the busiest airport in North America.
Planes used to stop here to gas up from everywhere.
--- Unknown ---
Whoo! Frank Sinatra, Albert Einstein--
--- Unknown ---
Mohammed Ali
--- Unknown ---
The Queen!
--- Unknown ---
Then they invented jet planes that can get across the ocean on one tank--
--- Unknown ---
So there’s no need to refuel anymore.
--- Unknown ---
Leavin’ us with this giant airport.
--- Unknown ---
Now there’s the reason I drive slow.
--- Unknown ---
That there in the middle of the road?
--- Unknown ---
Yah. That’s a moose.
--- Unknown ---
She’ll move when she’s good and ready.
--- NICK ---
Mind if I sit here?
--- DIANE ---
Oh, hello Nick! I thought we’d lost you.
--- NICK ---
No, I just needed to get an emergency prescription. Nothing serious.
It’s not like “Oh, my god, he’s off his medication!” I’ll stop talking now.
--- DIANE ---
It’s fine.
--- NICK ---
Any news yet about your husband, who was flying today?
--- DIANE ---
My--no. Do you mind if we just don’t talk about that? I haven’t been able to get to a phone.
