------ New 38 Planes (Reprise)/Somewhere in the Middle of Nowhere ------
--- BEVERLY (spoken) ---
The winds start to pick up. 50 mile an
hour winds. We've been here too long.
We're still on the ground, there's a hurricane
coming, and I'm thinking we're running out of time!
We have to leave. We have to leave now.
