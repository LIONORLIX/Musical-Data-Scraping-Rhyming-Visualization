--- HANNAH ---
Beulah walks me to church — and when we
get there, I light a candle for my son.
BEULAH
And I do too.
KEVIN T
I suddenly realize what that music from my
dream — it was an old hymn from when I was
a kid. I haven?t been to church in years, but
for some reason that song was in my head.
KEVIN T
MAKE ME A CHANNEL OF YOUR PEACE:
WHERE THERE IS HATRED,
LET ME BRING YOUR LOVE,
WHERE THERE IS INJURY,
YOUR PARDON, LORD,
AND WHERE THERE'S DOUBT
TRUE FAITH IN YOU.
HANNAH (& KEVIN T)
MAKE ME A CHANNEL OF YOUR PEACE
WHERE THERE?S DESPAIR IN LIFE,
LET ME BRING HOPE
(WHERE THERE?S DESPAIR IN LIFE,
LET ME BRING HOPE)
WHERE THERE IS DARKNESS, ONLY LIGHT
HANNAH
AND WHERE THERE?S SADNESS
HANNAH & KEVIN T
EVER JOY

There is a man here in town. He?s lived here
nearly his entire life. He heard that there was
a Rabbi diverted here and he came to find me
and tell me his story.
EDDIE (ACTOR 11)
I was born in Poland, I think. And my parents
— they were Jews — they sent me here before
the war started — I still remember some of the
prayers they taught me. As a boy, I was told
I should never tell anyone I was Jewish. Even
my wife. But after what happened on Tuesday
— so many stories gone — just like that. I
needed to tell someone.
ALI
During El-Fagir, when most people are asleep
it is easier to pray. But at Dhuhr, I can feel
them watching me. Sometimes I catch them
when they think I?m not looking — and I can
see the fear in their eyes.
ANNETTE
Excuse me? Beulah wanted me to check on
you. The library?s open — for anyone looking
for some peace — and a quiet place to pray.
Ali lays out a prayer mat and begins to pray.
