“My new secretary’s name is Robin (ROBIN: “what’s up!”).
Every year on September 11th, I close my office and give each employee $100
to go do random good deeds for strangers. It’s my way of remembering what happened.”
--- HANNAH (spoken) ---
“Beulah and I still keep in touch- she even came to visit me in New York.
And I’ll still phone her if I hear a really stupid joke.
Beulah- why are Newfoundlanders really terrible at knock knock jokes?”
BEULAH (spoken):
“I dunno, Hannah.”
HANNAH (spoken):
“Well, try it- I’ll be a Newfoundlander.”
BEULAH (spoken):
“Knock knock!”

I’m an islander I am an islander (there and here)
I’m an islander I am an islander
I’m an islander I am an islander

Welcome to the bog, welcome to the trees,
A kiss and a cod and whatever’s in between

To the coves and the caves and the people from the planes
