Finally, out of the darkness, my bus arrives at
The Salvation Army camp

We pass through a large gate and the bus pulls
To a stop. And through the windows — out
There in the darkness — we see all these people
Coming out of the buildings

GARTH (spoken)
We rarely use them, but everyone’s dusted off their
Salvation Army uniforms to welcome these people

I say, “Here you are. Out you go.” But he
Doesn’t understand. And he’s not getting off
None of them are

But then I notice his wife — well, she’s
Clutching a bible. Now, obviously I can’t read
It, but their bible — it’ll have the same number
System ours does — so I ask to see it
And I’m searching for something and then in
Philippians 4:6. I give ‘em their bible and I’m
Pointing, saying, look! Philippians 4:6 — Be
Anxious for nothing. Be anxious for nothing

GARTH & MUHUMUZA (spoken)

Giza na miti

All                                  Out of the darkness
Kati ya giza                     Suddenly brightness
Ghafla mwangaza            Everything changes
Ma-badiliko                     Darkness and trees
Giza na miti                     Out of the darkness
Kati ya giza                     Suddenly light
