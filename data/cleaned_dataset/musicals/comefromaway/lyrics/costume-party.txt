------ Costume Party ------
--- JANICE ---
3:45 a.m. Overnight, the community?s population
has gone from approximately 9,000 to
16,000. I?m sure barely any of us have slept
tonight. We?re hopeful that our visitors will be
back in the air come morning.
KEVIN T
I woke up from this dream which I can?t quite
remember, but there was this music in it that
I?d heard somewhere before.
KEVIN J
I woke up from a dream that we were stuck in
some backwater Canadian town and that my
air mattress deflated.
BOB
I woke up to the smell of? freshly baked
bread?
ANNETTE
4 a.m. in Newfoundland is breakfast time in
Germany. And we got a lot of passengers here
from Frankfurt, so breakfast starts at 4 a.m.
and we start scrambling eggs.
BOB
Poached eggs, scrambled eggs, omelettes.
DIANE
Fried Bologna.
NICK
Something called ?toutans.?
KEVIN T
I saw a casserole dish I don?t think I could lift.
BOB
They made enough food to feed 7,000 people.
It?s like they never slept.
BEULAH
There?s this one man — from the Middle East
— well, we don?t really know. Hasn?t said a
word to a soul — and some of the other passengers
seem a bit wary of him. So it?s a little
odd to find him poking around the kitchen.
ALI
Hello.
BEULAH
Hello. Can I help you with something?
ALI
I would like to be of assistance. With the food.
BEULAH
Oh, no. That?s not necessary.
ALI
But I am—
BEULAH
Really. You go out there and sit down.
CLAUDE
I?ve been going all night, but I can?t stop.
None of us can. I splash some cold water on
my face and just keep going. We?ve got 7,000
scared and angry people who don?t want to be
here. And they?re about to wake up.
DIANE
IN A CROWDED ROOM
FILLED WITH STRANGERS SLEEPING

NICK
I wake up in a crowded room full of people
sleeping on the floor and I see Diane and ask,
?Are we leaving??
DIANE
Any time now.
NICK
Is your hair different? I mean?you look good.
I like it.
DIANE
Hm! Thank you. No shampoo for three days.
KEVIN T
They start handing out clothes to anyone who
needs them.
KEVIN J
I haven?t changed my clothes in 39 hours.
BOB
I wanted to burn my socks.
KEVIN J
Kevin puts on this plaid thing. He says he?s ?incognito?
and that he?s going to ?blend in with the
natives,? but he just looks like a gay lumberjack.
DIANE
CHANGING INTO ANOTHER WOMAN?S
DONATED SET OF CLOTHES
KEVIN T

YOU ARE NOT YOURSELF
KEVIN T
AND YOU LOOK AROUND
AND BLINK YOUR EYES

KEVIN T & DIANE
THE PERSON IN THE MIRROR WHO?S
TURNED INTO SOMEONE ELSE
KEVIN J
Hey Little Sister — Yeah, still here where they
eat rainbows for breakfast. Are you taking care
of Mom? No. I just wish I was home. No, not
LA. Brooklyn. Shut up. You're such a brat. No.
I just needed to hear your voice.
BEULAH
Excuse me? Are you Hannah?
HANNAH
Yeah — that?s me.
BEULAH
My name?s Beulah — someone told me your
son?s a firefighter? Yeah, mine is too. Here
in town. And I know Gander?s not New York,
but? Is there anything I can do?
HANNAH
No. I just need to hear from my son.
BEULAH
I understand.
Beulah leaves.
HANNAH
PRAYING FOR A PHONE CALL

HANNAH & KEVIN J
LIKE NOTHING?S HAPPENED
AND I NEED TO HEAR WE?RE GOING BACK
BEFORE I GO INSANE
BEVERLEY
Good morning. I?m Captain Bass. I?ve just
heard from the airline. Now I know this is
going to be hard to hear, but the American airspace
remains closed. I can?t tell you how long
we?ll be on the ground. But, we are going to be
here for some time.
DIANE
HERE FOR SOME TIME
KEVIN J

WHEN WILL WE KNOW
ALL
HOW MUCH LONGER?
HANNAH
Beulah. Wait. Can you help me find a Catholic
Church?
DIANE
I can?t sit here. I need to get some air.
KEVIN T
Let?s go see where we are. The sun?s out. It?ll
do you good.
KEVIN J
Seriously? You know what, go get lost in the
woods. I?m going to be ready when we leave.
HANNAH & KEVIN J
AND IT?S SOMEHOW LIKE WE?RE STUCK
HERE AT A MESSED UP COSTUME PARTY
DIANE & KEVIN T
AND THERE?S NOTHING HERE FAMILIAR
HANNAH & KEVIN J
FAR AWAY FROM THOSE YOU CARE FOR
KEVIN T, KEVIN J, HANNAH & DIANE
