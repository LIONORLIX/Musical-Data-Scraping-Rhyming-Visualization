Tom?
Oh, thank God!
I finally got through
I borrowed a passenger's phone
How are you?
Are the kids okay?
No, I'm fine Tom
I'm fine
Safe and sound on the ground here in Newfoundland
We don't know much except for the BBC
Listen

Can you do something for me?

For each destination
That we flew together
Tell them that I'm fine
Put a pin here in Gander

Half of the passengers on our plane don't speak English!
--- Unknown ---
MAN (spoken)
Even if we knew what was happening, we don't speak their language
--- Unknown ---
MAN (spoken)
On our plane, we asked the flight attendants
--- Unknown ---

But the captain says not to say too much, and that's when rumors start flying
--- Unknown ---
WOMAN (spoken)
There's an accident

MAN (spoken)
Oh my god! It's World War III!
--- MAN ---
Meanwhile on our plane
--- MAN ---
We didn't have a clue
--- MAN ---
We were all going insane because
--- COMPANY ---
There wasn't squat to do
--- MAN ---
Then the captain starts apologizing
Says on behalf of the airline
He's giving each and everyone some
--- COMPANY ---
Complimentary booze!
Open the airplane doors
Wave at all the cars
Hello to whoever you are
Wherever we are

So the flight attendants brought out
All the mini-bottles of liquor
And delivered them to everyone
--- COMPANY ---
Soon everyone got friendlier
--- MAN ---
I took a couple of pictures of the view there in my camera
We didn't know where we were
But we knew that we were hammered
--- COMPANY ---
Open the airplane doors
Wave at all the locals
Surely there's something better to do than park
Wherever we are
--- Unknown ---
KEVIN JUNG (spoken)
We'd been sitting there for fourteen hours when we pull out the Grey Goose
--- Unknown ---
KEVIN TUERFF (spoken)
Kevin and I were kinda hiding it because...
--- Unknown ---
KEVIN JUNG (spoken)
...Because we didn't want to share it. Anyway, this woman,
this hot mess behind us, kept completely freaking out
--- Unknown ---
WOMAN (spoken)
I don't understand why they can't let us off. I mean, just to stretch our legs?!
I mean, really? I need to get some air! Oh, my God, I need to get off this plane!
--- Unknown ---
KEVIN TUERFF (spoken)
And my boyfriend Kevin. We're both named Kevin. It was cute for a while.
Anyway, Kevin was not dealing with it well
--- Unknown ---
KEVIN (spoken)
I'm going to kill her
--- Unknown ---
WOMAN (spoken)
Excuse me?! I would like to get off the plane. I am claustrophobic!
--- Unknown ---
KEVIN (spoken)
Excuse me, would you like some Xanax? Because you are freaking out and
it is freaking me out and we are all freaking the fuck out
--- COMPANY ---
Open the airplane doors
Let a little air in here
Cause I could use a shower or a bar
Open the airplane doors
Look at all the planes out there
There must be a convention it's bizarre
Wherever we are
--- Unknown ---
Twenty-eight hours
Out of the window
Twenty-eight hours
Nothing but darkness
Twenty-eight hours
Darkness and headlights
Twenty-eight hours
Nothing to see
--- Unknown ---
WOMAN (spoken)
The flight attendants keep telling us nothing's wrong. When, I've got kids,
and I've got grandkids, I know when someone's hiding something.
And when parents need their kids to stop asking questions, they start playing movies
--- Unknown ---
WOMAN (spoken)
We ran through every movie we had: Legally Blonde, Doctor Doolittle 2, and...Titanic
--- WOMAN ---
Near, far, wherever you
--- COMPANY ---
Nothing to do
Nothing to see
Thank god we stopped at the duty-free
Wherever we are
--- Unknown ---
NICK (spoken)
Do you mind if I sit? I need to get to work
and there's some drunk people at the back of the plane singing at the top of their lungs
--- Unknown ---
DIANE (spoken)
No, of course. I'm Diane
--- Unknown ---
NICK (spoken)
Nick. How are you doing?
--- Unknown ---
DIANE (spoken)
I'm...worried about someone. He was flying today.
I just wish there was some way to tell him where I am
--- Unknown ---
NICK (spoken)
Newfoundland. Oh, no, you know that. You just can't tell him. Right. I'm hoping
you're one of those people who laughs when English people say awkward things
--- Unknown ---
DIANE (spoken)
I just wish we knew what was happening
--- Unknown ---
WOMAN (spoken)
What's happening?
--- Unknown ---
WOMAN (spoken)
What's happening?
--- COMPANY ---
Somewhere in between
--- Unknown ---
DIANE (spoken)
Your life
--- Unknown ---
NICK (spoken)
And your work
--- COMPANY ---
When the world may be falling apart
And you think
--- DIANE ---
I'm alone
--- NICK ---
I'm alone
--- NICK & DIANE ---
And I'm so damn helpless
--- COMPANY ---
There's nothing left to do but drink
--- WOMAN ---
We open the airplane doors
Flash all the cars
Wooh!
I've never done that before
--- COMPANY ---
Twenty-eight hours
God! Over an entire day
Running out of things to say
And if there's someone
Going to clue us in
Tell us all what's happening
Because the sun is setting
And we're sitting in the dark
Wherever we are
--- Unknown ---
MAN (spoken)
Later that night, I'm up in the cockpit with some of the other passengers
when the pilot puts the radio on over the intercom,
and the whole plane goes silent when the president gives his speech
--- Unknown ---
GEORGE W. BUSH (spoken)
I ask the American people to join me in saying thanks for all the folks
who've been fighting hard to rescue our fellow citizens
and to join me in saying a prayer for the victims and their families.
The resolve of our great nation is being tested, but, make no mistake,
we will show the world that we will pass this test. God bless
--- BEVERLEY ---
You got through to the airline
Tom, I'm okay
Tell me what's happening out there
How bad is it?
Tom, tell me everything
Tom, who was in the air?
No, no I wouldn't have known them
No, no one on that airline
Charles?! Are you sure?
No, I'm fine Tom
