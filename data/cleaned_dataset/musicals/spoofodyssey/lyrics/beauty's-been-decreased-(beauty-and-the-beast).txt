------ Beauty's Been Decreased (Beauty and the Beast) ------
--- NASAL VOICE ---
He he he he he
--- MALE VOICE ---
Beauty and the beast
--- MRS. POTTS ---
Show as old as time
Worn as it can be
Oversized and grand
Then someone is canned
Unexpectedly
Just a little change
Says the Disney Beast
Profit's growing thin
Downsizing is in
Beauty's been decreased
--- Unknown ---
First a missing spoon
Then a fired fork
Then the chorus boys
Are replaced by toys
Even in New York
--- Unknown ---
Pink slips everywhere
No food at the feast
Wigs are all a mess
And they took my dress
Beauty's been decreased
Since we're in the red
Like a shrunken head
Beauty's been decreased
--- Unknown ---
(in an extremely high falsetto)
--- Unknown ---
Beauty's been decreased
