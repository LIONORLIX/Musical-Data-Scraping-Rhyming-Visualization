------ Everything Changes ------
--- Jenna ---
Today's a day like any other
But i am changed, i am a mother
Oh in an instant
And who i was has disappeared
It doesn't matter, now you're here
So innocent
I was lost for you to find
And now i'm yours and you are mine
--- Unknown ---
Two tiny hands, a pair of eyes
An unsung melody is mine for safekeeping
And i will guard it with my life
I'd hang the moon for it to shine on her sleeping
Starting here and starting now
I can feel the heart of how
--- Jenna, Becky, Dawn ---
Everything changes
--- Jenna ---
I didn't know, but now i see
Sometimes what is, is meant to be
You saved me
My blurry lines, my messy life
Come into focus and in time, maybe
I can heal and i can breathe
'Cause i can feel myself believe

Everything changes
--- Jenna and Ensemble ---
Oh, my heart's at the wheel now
--- Jenna ---
And all my mistakes
They make sense when i turn them around
Everything changes
What i thought was so permanent fades
In the blink of an eye, there's a new life in front of my face
And i know in due time, every right thing will find its right place
And i swear i'll remember to say we were both born today! Cause everything changed!
Everything changes
