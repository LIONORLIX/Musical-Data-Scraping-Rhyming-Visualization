Sugar, sugar

Sugar, butter, flour
Sugar, butter, flour

My hands pluck the things I know that I'll need
I take the sugar and butter from the pantry
I add the flour to begin what I am hoping to start
And then it's down with the recipe
And bake from the heart

Sugar
And butter
And flour
And mother

What's inside?
Everyone wants to know what's inside
And I always tell them but I
Feel more than words can say
You wanna know what's inside?
Simple question, so then what's the answer?
My whole life is in here
In this kitchen baking
