------ Opening Up ------
--- Cal ---
(spoken) jenna! What's the special pie today?
--- Jenna ---
Uh, deep shit blueberry bacon.
--- Cal ---
Deep shit?
--- Jenna ---
Ye- uh, dish! Deep dish. Sorry, cal!
--- Cal ---
C'mon, girl.
--- Jenna ---
(sung) the day starts like the rest we've seen
Another carbon copy of an old routine
--- Becky ---
Days keep coming
--- Dawn ---
One out, one in
--- Becky, Dawn, Jenna ---
They keep coming
--- Cal ---
(spoken) and make the coffee strong enough to chew!
--- Jenna ---
(sung) i don't know what i wish i had
But there's no time now for thinking things like that
We've got too much to do
--- Becky, Dawn ---
Too much to do
--- Jenna, Becky, Dawn ---
All these same things
We're always
--- Unknown ---
Opening up
Letting the day in
Over a cup
We'll say hello, how ya been?
Looking around
Seeing the same things
Every day brings
hello, how ya been?
thank you, come again!
Some things never change
--- Becky ---
I wouldn't call this place a happy end
But i been round the block and just came back again
A small town like ours ain't much
But sometimes home is where your ass ends up
--- Cal ---
Order up!
--- Dawn ---
Ordered up is how the day will find me
Everything in its place and time
And i like the way most of the days look exactly the same
--- Cal ---
Order up!
--- Jenna, Becky, Dawn ---
Check the clock
Tick, tick tock
--- Cal ---
Don't stop!
Serve with a smile!
--- Jenna, Becky, Dawn ---
Hurry up, fill the coffee cup
And then in a while
Take a breath when you need to be reminded that with days like these
We can only do the best we can
Till we do it again
--- Cal ---
Come on, move it now!
--- Jenna, becky, dawn ---
Opening up
Letting the day in
Opening up
Some things never change
hello, how ya been?
thank you, come again!
Some things never change
