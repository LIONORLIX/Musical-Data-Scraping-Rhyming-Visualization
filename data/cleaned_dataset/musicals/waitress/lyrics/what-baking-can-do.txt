------ What Baking Can Do ------
--- Unknown ---
Make it work
Make it easy
Make it clever, craft it into pieces
Make it sweet
Crimp the edges
Or make it sour and serve with lemon wedges
Even doubt
Can be delicious
And it washes off of all the dirty dishes
When it's done
I can smile
It's on someone else's plate for a while
--- Unknown ---
I'll place it on display
And then I'll slice and serve my worries away
--- Unknown ---
I can fix this
I can twist it into sugar, butter covered pieces
Never mind what's underneath it
I have done it before
I'll bake me a door to help me get through
I learned that from you
Mama, it's amazing what baking can do
--- Unknown ---
Make it up
And surprise them
Tell them all my secrets but disguise them
So they dance on the tongue
Of the very people that they're secrets from
Make it soon
Make it better
Though, better never lasts forever
I'll make it small so it fits . . . .
--- Unknown ---
Even this . . .
Even now . . .
Even as the walls come tumbling down
Even as I can't stop remembering how
Every door we ever made, we never once walked out
Something I never got the chance to ask her about
--- Unknown ---
So with flour on my hands
I'll show them all how
Goddamn happy I am
Sugar, butter, flour
Don't let me down!
