------ Big Time ------
--- Lottie ---
This time it's the big time
In a short time we can be
The cherry on the top of the sundae
The shiny star on top of the tree
So you'd better Grab it with your both hands
When that great moment arrives
'Cause this time it's the big time
It's the big time of our lives
--- Unknown ---
This time it's the extra
It's the special, it's the plus
This time we won't say those lucky bastards
This time those lucky bastards are us
Ain't we somethin'
Farewell to the small time
To the flea bags and the dives
' Cause this time it's the big time
It's the big time of our lives
--- Fatty ---
I'm gonna buy myself a pierce-arrow
And wave to all my fans in the streets
[Mabel]
I'm gonna have a mansion like Pickford's
[Lottie]
I'm gonna sleep on black satin sheets
[Frank, Kleiman& Fox]
And we'll raise more hell, make more hay
Than decent fellows should
Because the gang from king's highway
[All]
Is goin' to Hollywood!
'Cause this time it's the big time
And it's high time we were seen
By ev'ry dapper dude in Dakota
On ev'ry scroungy neighborhood screen
So you'd better Grab it with your both hands
When that great moment arrives
'Cause this time it's the big time
It's the big time of our lives!
--- Unknown ---
This time it's the big time
In a short time we can be
The cherry on the top of the sundae
The shiny star on top of the tree
So you better grab it With your both hands
When that great moment arrives
'Cause this time it's the big time
It's the big time of our lives
In each hundred million
There's a handful that survives
And this time we're that handful
So it's bye bye to those one-nights
This time it's the kleig lights
