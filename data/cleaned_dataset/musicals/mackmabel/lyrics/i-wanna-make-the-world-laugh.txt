------ I Wanna Make The World Laugh ------

Heartbreak and passion
May both be in fashion
But I wanna make the world laugh
Let others do drama of sin and disgrace
While I throw a fish in the heroine's face
To keep them in stitches
I burn the star's britches
And saw cousin Sally in half
Let Mister Griffith deal with humanity's woes
I'd rather film the guy with the fly on his nose
My goal and my mission
My burning ambition
Is ... I wanna make the world laugh!

Some have a leaning
For dark hidden meaning
But I wanna make the world laugh
Let other directors film tragic romance
But I like a hero with ants in his pants
Nothing I've found is
As sweet as that sound is
The music that fattens the calf
My great new plot is not about tyranny's lash
It deals with itching powder and Papa's mustache
The curse I've been blessed with
Completely possessed with
Is ... I wanna make the world laugh!
--- Unknown ---
This curse I've been blessed with
Completely possessed with
