------ When Mabel Comes In The Room ------
--- Fatty ---
Somehow the ceiling
Seems a little higher
From the very moment I see Mabel come in the room
It feels like someone
Lit a roaring fire
But it's just the glow I get when Mabel comes in the room
The faded sofa
Stands a little prouder
That bunch of artificial flowers might even bloom
I can feel my heartbeat
Beat a little louder
The very moment I see Mabel come in the room
--- Harry, Freddie & Andy ---
The dingy curtains
Seem a little brighter
I can hear the tinny piano playin' a gorgeous song
The grouchy doorman
Seems a little politer
It's his way of saying Welcome home, you've been gone too long
--- Kleiman ---
The day you left us
Was a small disaster
You took the love and light and laughter
And left the gloom
[Fox]
But I can feel my heartbeat
Beat a little faster
[All]
And I can swiftly shed the strain of the years
The very moment her first footstep appears
[Kleiman]
The very moment I see Mabel come in the room
--- Company ---
The threadbare carpet
Seems a little thicker
From the very moment I see Mabel come thru the door
The elevator
Runs a little quicker
Just as if it didn't want to stop at another floor
[Lottie]
The kids from Keystone
Are the kids no longer
We miss just having you around and the old rapport
[All]
But I can feel my heartbeat
Beat a little stronger
And I can swiftly shed the strain of the years
The very moment her first footstep appears
The very moment I see Mabel
--- Unknown ---
The faded sofa
Stands a little prouder
That bunch of artificial flowers might even bloom
I can feel my heartbeat
Beat a little louder
And I can swiftly shed the strain of the years
The very moment her first footstep appears
