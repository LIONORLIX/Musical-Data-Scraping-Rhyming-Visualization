------ Tap Your Troubles Away ------
--- Lottie ---
Tap your troubles away
You've bounced a big check
Your mom has the vapors
Tap your troubles away
Your car had a wreck
They're serving you papers
When you're the one that it always rains on
Simply try putting your Mary Janes on
Your boss just gave you the axe
There's years of back tax
You simply can't pay
Of a sky full of crap
Always lands in your lap
Make a curtsey and
Tap your troubles away
Tap your troubles away
You're sued for divorce
Your brother gets locked up
Tap your troubles away
You're fat as a horse
And find that you're knocked up
[Girls]
When you need something to turn your mind off
[Lottie]
Why not try tapping your poor behind off?
--- Lottie & Girls ---
Your boat goes over the falls
The plane you're on stalls
The pilot yells pray
[Lottie]
When your parachute strap
Is beginning to snap
Smile a big smile
--- Lottie & Girls ---
And tap, tap, tap your troubles away
--- Unknown ---
[Lottie] When the wolf's at the door
There's a bluebird in store
If you glide cross the floor
Till your ankles get sore
Just tap your troubles away!
--- Girls ---
Your troubles away
Your troubles away
[Lottie]
