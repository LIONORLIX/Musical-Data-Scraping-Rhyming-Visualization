------ Building The Barricade ------
--- Unknown ---
(Enjolras is addressing the revolutionaries)
Enjolras:
Here upon theses stones we will build our barricade
In the heart of the city we claim as our own
Each man to his duty and don't be afraid
Wait! I will need a report on the strength of the foe
--- (Disguised as a rebel) Javert ---
I can find out the truth
i know their ways
fought their wars
served my time
in the days of my youth
--- Various Students ---
Now the people will fight
And so they might
Dogs will bark
fleas will bite
they will do what is right

(Marius spots Eponine dressed as a boy)
Marius:
Hey little boy what's this I see?
God Eponine, the things you do
--- Eponine ---
I know this is no place for me
still I would rather be with you
--- Marius ---
Get out before the trouble starts
get out 'ponine you might get shot
--- Eponine ---
I got you worried now I have
that shows you like me quite a lot
--- Marius ---
There is a way that you can help
you are the answer to a prayer
Please take this letter to Cosette
and pray to God that she's still there
--- Eponine ---
Little you know,
little you care
Eponine:
I have a letter, M'sieur
It's addressed to your daughter Cosette
It's from a boy at the barricade, sir
in the Rue de Villette
Jean Valjean:
Give that letter here, my boy
Eponine:
He said give it to Cosette
Jean Valjean:
You have my word
that my daughter will know
what this letter contains
Tell the young man
she will read it tomorrow
and here's for your pains
Go careful now stay out of sight
there's danger in the streets tonight
Dearest Cosette,
you have entered my soul
and soon you will be gone
can it be only a day since we met
and the world was reborn
if I should fall in battle
let this be my goodbye
now that I know you love me as well
it is harder to die
i pray that god will bring me home
to be with you
pray for your Marius
he prays for you
