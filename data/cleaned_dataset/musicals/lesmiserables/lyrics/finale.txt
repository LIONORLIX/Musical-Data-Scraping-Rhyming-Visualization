--- VALJEAN ---
Now you are here
Again beside me
Now I can die in peace
For now my life is blessed
--- COSSETTE ---
You will live, papa
You're going to live
It's too soon to ever say goodbye
--- VALJEAN ---
Yes, cossette
Forbid me now to die
I'll obey
I will try

On this page
I write my last confession
Read it well
When I at last am sleeping
It's a story of those who always loved you
Your mother gave her life for you and gave you to my keeping
--- FANTINE ---
Come with me
Where chains will never bind you
All your grief
At last, at last behind you
Lord in heaven;
Look down on him in mercy
--- VALJEAN ---
Forgive me all my trespases and take me to your glory
--- FANTINE, VALJEAN AND EPONINE ---
Take my hand
And lead me to salvation
Take my love
For love is everlasting
And remember
The truth that once was spoken:
To love another person is to see the face of god
--- ALL ---
Do you hear the people sing?
Lost in the valley of the night
It is the music of a people who are climbing to the light
For the wretched of the earth
There is a flame that never dies
Even the darkest nights will end and the sun will rise
--- Unknown ---
They will live again in freedom in the garden of the lord
They will walk behind the ploughshare
They will put away the sword
The chain will be broken and all men will have their reward!
--- Unknown ---
Will you join in our crusade?
Who will be strong and stand with me?
Somewhere beyond the barricade is there a world you long to see?
Do you hear the people sing?
Say, do you hear the distant drums?
It is the future that they bring when tomorrow comes!
REPEAT

Aaaaah, aaaaah, aaaah,
