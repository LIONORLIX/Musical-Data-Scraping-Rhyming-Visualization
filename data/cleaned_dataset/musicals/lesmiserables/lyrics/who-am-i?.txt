------ Who Am I? ------
--- VALJEAN ---
He thought that man was me
Without a second glance!
That stranger he has found
This man could be my chance!
--- Unknown ---
Why should I save his hide?
Why should I right this wrong
When I have come so far
And struggled for so long?
--- Unknown ---
If I speak, I am condemned.
If I stay silent, I am damned!
--- Unknown ---
I am the master of hundreds of workers.
They all look to me.
How can I abandon them?
How would they live
If I am not free?
--- Unknown ---
If I speak, they are condemned.
If I stay silent, I am damned!
--- Unknown ---
Who am I?
Can I condemn this man to slavery
Pretend I do not feel his agony
This innocent who wears my face
Who goes to judgement in my place
Who am I?
Can I conceal myself for evermore?
Pretend I'm not the man I was before?
And must my name until I die
Be no more than an alibi?
Must I lie?
How can I ever face my fellow men?
How can I ever face myself again?
My soul belongs to God, I know
I made that bargain long ago
He gave me hope when hope was gone
He gave me strength to journey on
--- He appears in front of the court ---
--- Unknown ---
Who am I? Who am I?
I'm Jean Valjean!
--- He unbuttons his shirt to reveal the number tattooed to his chest ---
--- Unknown ---
And so Javert, you see it's true
This man bears no more guilt than you!
Who am I?
