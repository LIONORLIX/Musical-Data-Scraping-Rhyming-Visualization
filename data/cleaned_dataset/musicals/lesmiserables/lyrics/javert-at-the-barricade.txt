Listen my friends
i have done as i said
I have been to their lines
I have counted each man.
I will tell what i can.

Better be warned they have armies to spare
and the danger is real
We will need all our cunning.
to bring them to yield
--- ENJOLRAS ---
Have faith
If you know what there movments are we'll spoil their game there are ways that our people can fight
we shall over come there power!
--- JAVERT ---
I have overheard their plans
there will be no attack tonight
they intend to starve us out
before they start a proper fight
concentrate their force
hits us from the right.

Liar!
Good evening, dear inspector
Lovely evening, my dear.
I know this man, my friends
His name is Inspector Javert
So don't believe a word he says
'Cause none of it's true
This only goes to show
What little people can do!
--- Unknown ---
And little people know
When little people fight
We may look easy pickings
But we've got some bite
So never kick a dog
Because he's just a pup
We'll fight like twenty armies
And we won't give up
So you'd better run for cover
