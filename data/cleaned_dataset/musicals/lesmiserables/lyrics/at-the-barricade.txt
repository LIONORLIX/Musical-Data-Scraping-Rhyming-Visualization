------ At The Barricade ------
--- Enjolras ---
Now we pledge ourselves to hold this barricade.
Marius:
Let them come in their legions, and they will be met.
Enjolras:
Have faith in yourselves, and do not be afraid.
Rebel:
Let's give 'em a screwing they'll never forget!
--- Rebel ---
This is where it begins,
and if I should die in the fight to be free,
where the fighting is hardest, there will I be.
Enjolras:
Let them come if they dare, we'll be there!
--- (Yells) ---
He's back! It's the volunteer!
--- Javert ---
Listen my friends, I have done what I said,
I have been to their lines, I have counted each man,
I will tell what I can.
Let it be warned they have armies to spare, and our danger is real.
We will need all our cunning to bring them to heel.
--- Enjolras ---
Have faith, if you know what their movements are we'll spoil their game.
There are ways that a people can fight.
We shall overcome their power!
--- Javert ---
I have overheard their plans,
There will be no attack tonight.
They intend to starve us out before they start a proper fight.
Concentrate their force, hit us from the right.
--- Gavroche ---
Liar!
Good evening dear inspector, lovely evenin' my dear.
I know this man, my friends, his name's inspector Javert.
So don't believe a word he says 'cause none of it's true.
This only goes to show what little people can do.
--- Rebel ---
Bravo little Gavroche, your the top of the class!
So what are we gonna do with this snake in the grass?
--- Enjolras ---
Tie this man, and take him to the tavern in there.
The people will decide your fate, Inspector Javert.
--- Javert ---
Shoot me now, or shoot me later
Every schoolboy to his sport, and death to each and every traitor,
I renounce your people's court.
--- Enjolras ---
Take this man, bring him through, there is work we have to do.
--- Unknown ---
Rebel (yells): There's a boy climbing the barricade!
