------ Empty Chairs At Empty Tables ------

(Marius, recovering from his wounds, imagines he is back at the ABC cafe)

There's a grief that can't be spoken.
There's a pain goes on and on.
Empty chairs at empty tables
Now my friends are dead and gone.
--- Unknown ---
Here they talked of revolution.
Here it was they lit the flame.
Here they sang about `tomorrow'
And tomorrow never came.
--- Unknown ---
From the table in the corner
They could see a world reborn
And they rose with voices ringing
I can hear them now!
The very words that they had sung
Became their last communion
On the lonely barricade at dawn.
--- Unknown ---
Oh my friends, my friends forgive me
--- Unknown ---
(The ghosts of those who died on the barricade appear)
--- Unknown ---
That I live and you are gone.
There's a grief that can't be spoken.
There's a pain goes on and on.
--- Unknown ---
Phantom faces at the window.
Phantom shadows on the floor.
Empty chairs at empty tables
Where my friends will meet no more.
--- Unknown ---
(The ghosts fade away)
--- Unknown ---
Oh my friends, my friends, don't ask me
What your sacrifice was for
Empty chairs at empty tables
