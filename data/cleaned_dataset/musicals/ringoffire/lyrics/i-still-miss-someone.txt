------ I Still Miss Someone ------
--- Unknown ---
At my door the leaves are falling
A cold wild wind has come
Sweethearts walk by together
And I still miss someone
--- Unknown ---
I go out on a party
And look for a little fun
But I find a darkened corner
because I still miss someone
--- Unknown ---
Oh, no I never got over those blues eyes
I see them every where
I miss those arms that held me
When all the love was there
--- Unknown ---
I wonder if she's sorry
For leavin' what we'd begun
There's someone for me somewhere
