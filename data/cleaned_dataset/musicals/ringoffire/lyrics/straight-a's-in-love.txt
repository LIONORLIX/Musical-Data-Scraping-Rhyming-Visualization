------ Straight A's In Love ------
--- Unknown ---
Well, the readin' and the writtin' and arithmatic
Never did get through to me
It ain't because i'm square or thick
'Cause i learned my abc's
But when i graduated from the grammer school
And i moved one grade above
I began to be a snook at books
But i made straight a's in love
--- Unknown ---
Now the teacher would say
To learn your algebra
But i'd bring home c's and d's
How could i make an a
When there's a swingin' maid
On the left and on the right
And in the back and the front of me
Oh, my grades are low
On my card i know
But they oughta give me one above
If they'd give me a mark
For learnin' in the dark
I'd have straight a's in love

Now in my senior year
With graduation near
I did my homework everynight
And when my momma said
I oughta go to bed
I turn out all the lights
But my sweetie pie
Was waitin' right outside
She'd be a cooin' like a dove
Though i did my best
I failed semester test
But made straight a's in love
