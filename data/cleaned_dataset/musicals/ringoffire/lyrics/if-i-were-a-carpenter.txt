------ If I Were A Carpenter ------
--- Unknown ---
If i were a carpenter
And you were a lady,
Would you marry me anyway?
Would you have my baby?
--- Unknown ---
If a tinker were my trade
Would you still find me,
Carrying the pots i made,
Following behind me.
--- Unknown ---
Save my love through loneliness,
Save my love for sorrow,
I'm given you my onliness,
Come give your tomorrow.
--- Unknown ---
If i worked my hands in wood,
Would you still love me?
Answer me babe, yes i would,
I'll put you above me.
--- Unknown ---
If i were a miller
At a mill wheel grinding,
Would you miss your color box,
And your soft shoe shining?
--- Unknown ---
If i were a carpenter
And you were a lady,
Would you marry me anyway?
Would you have my baby?
Would you marry anyway?
Would you have my baby?
