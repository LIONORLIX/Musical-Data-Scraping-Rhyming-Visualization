------ All Over Again ------
--- Unknown ---
Every time I look at you I fall in love, all over again
Every time I think of you it all begins, all over again
--- Unknown ---
One little dream at night and I can dream all day
It only takes a memory to thrill me
One little kiss from you and I just fly away
Pour me out your love until you fill me
--- Unknown ---
I wanna fall in love beginning from the start, all over again
Show me how you stole away my heart, all over again
--- Unknown ---
One little dream at night and I can dream all day

Show me how you stole away my heart, all over again
--- Unknown ---
All over again, All over again, All over again, All over again
