------ While I've Got It On My Mind ------
--- Unknown ---
Layin' 'round home with a ball game on
Feelin' fairly fine
Blackberry jam is cookin' in the pan
And the jam and the cook are mine
--- Unknown ---
I like my honey from the hives of home
And berries from my old vine
And I like to get my lovin'
While I got it on my mind
--- Unknown ---
My dog is asleep at my bare feet
It's a good day for layin' around
Just her and me and it's Saturday
Everybody's gone to town
--- Unknown ---
We've been workin' hard and she gets tired
That puts me in a bind
'Coz I like to get my lovin'
While I got it on my mind
--- Unknown ---
Then she looks at me and I can see
That old familiar look
And the jam is sweet as she lowers the heat
To give it time to cook
--- Unknown ---
Then I lock the door and across the floor
To my queen of woman kind
Yeah, I like to get my lovin'
While I got it on my mind
--- Unknown ---
Now boys don't you be ramble and free
And leavin' the girls to cry
'Coz the nights get cold and there ain't no gold
That'll ever satisfy
--- Unknown ---
And there ain't no joy that'll come to you boys
Like the kind I've known at times
When I go right on in that lover
While I got in on my mind
--- Unknown ---
Yeah, I like to get my lovin'
