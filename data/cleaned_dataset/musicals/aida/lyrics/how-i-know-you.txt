------ How I Know You ------
--- Mereb ---
--- Unknown ---
I grew up in your hometown
At least began to grow
I hadn't got to my first shave
before the body blow
Egyptians in the courtyard
--- Unknown ---
My family in chains
You witnessed our abduction
Which possibly explains
How I know you
How I know you
--- Unknown ---
Before that fateful morning
My family enjoyed
A privileged existence
For my father was employed
As advisor to the King no less
Which surely rings a bell
--- Unknown ---
For as your are his daughter
You probably can tell
How I know you
Yes I know you
--- Aida ---
--- Unknown ---
You know too much and what you say
Is better left unknown
And now I'm just a slave like you
Our lives our not our own
--- Mereb ---
--- Unknown ---
I never have abandoned
And nor I think could you
That spark of hope for freedom
No terror can subdue
--- Aida ---
--- Unknown ---
My only hope is silence
You've never seen my face
--- Mereb ---
--- Unknown ---
No you remain a princess
In any time or place
--- Aida ---
--- Unknown ---
You don't know me
--- Mereb ---
--- Unknown ---
Yes, I know you
--- Aida ---
--- Unknown ---
You don't know me
--- Mereb ---
--- Unknown ---
How I know you
