------ Step Too Far ------
--- Amneris ---
--- Unknown ---
It's so strange he doesn't show me
more affection than he needs
Almost formal too respectful
never takes romantic leads
There are times when I imagine
I'm not always on his mind
He's not thinking what I'm thinking
Always half a step behind
Always half a step behind

--- Radames ---
--- Unknown ---
I'm in every kind of trouble
Can't you tell, just look at me
Half ecstatic,half dejected
All in all I'm all at sea
Easy terms I thought I wanted
Fill me now with chilling dread
You could never know the chaos
Of a life turned on it's head
Of a life turned on it's head

--- Aida ---
--- Unknown ---
I am certain that I love him
But a love can be misplaced
Have I compromissed my people
In my passion and my haste?
I could be his life companion
Anywhere but where we are
Am I leader? Am I traitor?
Did I take a step too far?
