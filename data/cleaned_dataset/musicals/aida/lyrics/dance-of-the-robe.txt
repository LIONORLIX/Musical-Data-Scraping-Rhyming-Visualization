------ Dance of the Robe ------
--- Aida ---
It's knowing what they want of me that scares me
It's knowing having followed that I must lead
It's knowing that each person there compares me
To those in my past whom I now succeed
But how can whatever I do for them now
Be enough
Be enough
--- Nubians ---
Aida! Aida!
All we ask of you
Is a lifetime of service, wisdom, courage
To ask more would be selfish
But nothing less will do
Aida! Aida!
--- Nehebka ---
You robe should be golden, your robe should be perfect
Instead of this ragged concoction of thread
But may you be moved by its desperate beauty
To give us new life for we'd rather be dead
Then live in the squalor and shame of the slave
To the dance!
To the dance!
--- Nubians ---
Aida! Aida!
All we ask of you
--- Unknown ---
All we ask is a lifetime of
Service, wisdom, courage
To ask more would be selfish
But nothing less will do
Aida! Aida!
--- Nubians ---
Aida! Aida!
Aida! Aida! Aida!
--- Aida ---
I know expectations are wild and almost
Beyond my fulfillment but they won't hear
A word of a doubt or see signs of weakness
My nigh on impossible duty is clear
If I can rekindle my ancestors' dreams
It's enough
It's enough
--- Unknown ---
Aida: It's enough Nubians: Aida!
--- Nubians ---
Aida! Aida!
Aida! Aida! Aida!
