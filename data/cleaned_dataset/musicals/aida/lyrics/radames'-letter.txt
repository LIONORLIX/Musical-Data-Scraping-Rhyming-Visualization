------ Radames' Letter ------
--- Radames ---
--- Unknown ---
I'm sorry for everything I've said
And for anything I forgot to say
When things get so complicated
I stumble at best muddle through
I wish that our lives could be simple
I don't want the world only you
--- Unknown ---
Oh I wish I could tell you this face to face
But there's never the time never the place
So this letter will have to do
