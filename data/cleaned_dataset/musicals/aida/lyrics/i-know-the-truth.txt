------ I Know the Truth ------
--- Amneris ---
How did I come to this?
How did I slip and fall?
How did I throw half a lifetime away
Without any thought at all?
--- Unknown ---
This should have been my time
It's over, it never began
I closed my eyes to so much for so long
and I no longer can
--- Unknown ---
I try to blame it on fortune
Some kind of shift in a star
But I know the truth and it haunts me
it's flown just a little too far
I know the truth and it mocks me
I know the truth and it shocks me
It's flown just a little too far.
--- Unknown ---
Why do I want him still?
Why when there's nothing there?
How to go on with the rest of my life
To pretend I don't care
This should've been my time
It's over-It never began
I closed my eyes to so much for so long
and I no longer can
--- Unknown ---
I try to blame it on fortune
Some kind of twist in my fate
But I know the truth and it haunts me
I learned it a little too late
--- Unknown ---
Oh I know the trth and it mocks me
I know the truth and it shocks me
I learned it a little too late
