------ Gods Love Nubia ------
--- Aida ---
Take me in my dreams recurring
Cheerful as a childhood dance
Into one more taste of freedom
One more longing backward glance
--- Unknown ---
In the sway of somber music
I shall never, never understand
Let me slip into the sweeter
Chorus of that other land
--- Unknown ---
The gods love Nubia, the beautiful, the golden
The radiant, the fertile, the gentle and the blessed
--- Unknown ---
The pain of Nubia is only for the moment
the desolate the suffering
the plundered, the opressed
--- Nehebka ---
The gods love Nubia, their glorious creation
Its songs roll sweetly across the harvest plain
--- Nehebka & Aida ---
The tears of Nubia, a passing aberration
They wash into the river and are never cried again
--- Nehebka, Aida, Mereb, and Nubian Woman ---
The gods love Nubia, we have to keep believing
The scattered and divided, we are still it's heart
--- Aida ---
The fall of Nubia, ephemeral and fleeting
The spirit always burning though the flesh is torn apart.
--- All ---
The fall of Nubia
Ephemeral and fleeting
The spirit always burning
Though the flesh is torn apart
--- Unknown ---
Take me in my dreams recurring
Cheerful as a childhood dance
Into one more taste of freedom
One more longing backward glance
The gods love Nubia, the beautiful, the golden
The radiant, the fertile, the gentle and the blessed
The pain of Nubia is only for the moment
the desolate the suffering
the plundered, the opressed
--- Unknown ---
The gods love Nubia
we have to keep believing
Though scattered and divided we are still it's heart
The fall of Nubia ephemeral and fleeting the spirit always
Burning though the flesh is torn apart
The spirit always burning though the flesh is torn apart
--- Aida ---
Apart
--- All ---
Take me in my dreams recurring
