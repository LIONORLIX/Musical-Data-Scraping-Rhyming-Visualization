------ Not Me ------
--- Radames ---
I once knew all the answers
I stood on certain ground
A picture of true happiness
Confidence so effortless
No brighter could be found
--- Mereb ---
Oh No
--- Radames ---
I never asked the questions
That trouble me today
I knew all there was to know
Love worn lightly
Put on show
--- Unknown ---
My conquests on display (Mereb:I can't believe He's changing)
--- Unknown ---
And who'd have thought that (Mereb:Oh, no)
Confidence could die?
Not me , Not me (Mereb:Not me, not me)
That all I took for granted was a lie
--- Unknown ---
Not me, Not me
And who'd have guessed
I'd throw my world away
--- Unknown ---
To be with someone I'm afraid will say (Mereb:This can never)
Not me,not me (Mereb:Be)
--- Mereb ---
He's in love
But he's not the only one
Who'll be changed
--- Aida ---
I shall not envy lovers
But long for what they share
--- Amneris ---
An empty room is merciless
Don't be surprised if I confess
I need some comfort there
--- Aida and Amneris ---
And who'd have thought
That love could be so good?
Not me, not me
And show me things I never understood
Not me, not me
--- Unknown ---
Who'd have guessed he'd
Throw his world away
To be with someone til his dying day
Not me, not me
--- Radames, Amneris,Aida ---
And who'd have thought that love
Could be so good
Not me, not me (Mereb:Not me, not me)
My/his secrets &
My/his passions understood
Not me, not me (Mereb:Not me, not me)
--- Unknown ---
Who'd have guessed
I'd/ he throw My/his world away
To be with someone til my/his dying day
