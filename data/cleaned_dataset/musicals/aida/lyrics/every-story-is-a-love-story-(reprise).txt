------ Every Story is a Love Story (Reprise) ------
--- Amneris ---
From deep within a tomb
A gentle light still shone
Showing me my path
As I ascended to the throne
Certain in my heart
That ancient wars must cease
The lovers' deaths gave birth
to a reign of peace
--- Unknown ---
And their story
And my journey
And the lesson they provide
Draw their strength and inspiration
