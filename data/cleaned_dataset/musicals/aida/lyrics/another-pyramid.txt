While you've been away cavorting
Matters here have moved apace
Now I need you home supporting
All the plans I've put in place
--- Unknown ---
First of all this means your wedding
You'll recall your future bride
For the way that Pharaoh's heading
Time's no longer on our side
--- Unknown ---
According to the hawk god, Horus
Our most regal invalid
Is not that much longer for us
Build another pyramid!
--- Unknown ---
There are many who'll be tearful
As our leader fades away
But our architects are cheerful
And each dog must have its day
--- Unknown ---
If our country is to flourish
Then my son must take the lead
Be our inspiration, nourish
All our hopes our dreams our creed
--- Unknown ---
Soon our monarch will have filled a
Tomb just like his fathers did
Summon Egypt's greatest builders
Re: another pyramid
--- Ministers ---
Build it, build it
Another pyramid
--- Unknown ---
There will be a time for mourning
But for now put plans on hold
--- Ministers ---
Hold
--- Unknown ---
For I give the nation warning
That before the corpse is cold
--- Ministers ---
Cold
--- Unknown ---
We'll extend fair Egypt's power
Egypt's glory strength and style
We shall have our finest hour
Far beyond the mighty Nile

He must have a vault that's grand by
Any standards, floor to lid
Put five thousand slaves on stand by
Build another pyramid!
--- Ministers ---
--- Unknown ---
Build it, build it
Build it, build it
Build it, build it
Build it-

Build it, build it
Build it-

He must have a vault that's grand by
Any standards, floor to lid
Put five thousand slaves on stand by
