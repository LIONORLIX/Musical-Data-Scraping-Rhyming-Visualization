------ Every Story Is a Love Story ------
--- Amneris ---
Every story, tale or memoir
Every saga or romance
Whether true or fabricated
Whether planned or happenstance
--- Unknown ---
Whether sweeping through the ages
Casting centuries aside
Or a hurried brief recital
Just a thirty-minute ride
--- Unknown ---
Whether bright or melancholy
Rough and ready, finely spun
Whether with a thousand players
Or a lonely cast of one
--- Unknown ---
Every story, new or ancient
Bagatelle or work of art
All are tales of human failing
All are tales of love at heart
--- Unknown ---
This is the story
Of a love that flourished
In a time of hate
--- Unknown ---
Of lovers no tyranny could separate
Love set into motion on the Nile's shore
Destiny ignited by an act of war
--- Unknown ---
Egypt saw the mighty river as its very heart and soul
Source of life for all her people
That only Egypt could control
Destruction of her southern neighbor justified
