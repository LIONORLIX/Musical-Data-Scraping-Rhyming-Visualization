Oh, Oh
Fortune Favors the Brave
Oh, Oh
Fortune Favors the Brave
--- Radames ---
--- Unknown ---
We have swept to glory,
Egypt's mastery expands
From the Nile's northern most delta
To the dry, dry southern sands
--- Unknown ---
The more we find, the more we see,
The more we come to learn
The more that we explore,
The more we shall return
--- Soldiers ---
--- Unknown ---
Oh, oh
Fortune favors the brave
--- Radames ---
--- Unknown ---
It's all worked out, my road is clear
The lines of latitude extend
Way beyond my wildest dreams
Toward some great triumphant end
--- Unknown ---
We seize the day
We turned the tide
We touched the stars
We mocked the grave
We moved into uncharted lands
--- Radames & Soldiers ---
--- Unknown ---
Fortune favors the brave
--- Radames ---
--- Unknown ---
The more we find, the more we see
The more we come to learn
The more that we explore
The more we shall return
--- Unknown ---
Nothing is an accident
We are free to have it all
We are what we want to be
It's in ourselves to rise or fall
--- Unknown ---
This is easy to believe
When distant places call to me
It's harder from the palace yard
Fortune favors the free
--- Soldiers ---
Oh, oh
--- Radames ---
--- Unknown ---
Fortune favors the young!
--- Soldiers ---
Oh, oh
--- Radames ---
