------ Dawn (Go Away) ------
--- Unknown ---
Pretty as a midsummers morn, they call her Dawn
--- Unknown ---
Dawn, go away I'm no good for you
Oh, Dawn, stay with him he'll be good to you
Hang on, Hang on to him
--- Unknown ---
Think, what a big man he'll be
Think, all the places you'll see
Now think what the future would be
with a poor boy like me
--- Unknown ---
Dawn go away, please go away
Although I know I want you to stay
Dawn go away, please go away
Baby don't cry, it's better this way
--- Unknown ---
Oh Dawn go away, back where you belong
Girl we can't change the places
where we were born
Before you say that you want me
--- Unknown ---
I want you to think what your family would say
think what you're throwing away
Now think what the future would be
with a poor boy like me
