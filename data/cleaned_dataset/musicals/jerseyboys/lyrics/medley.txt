(Stay, stay, stay)
Oh, just a little bit longer
Please, please, please, please, please
Tell me that you're gonna
Now your daddy don't mind
And your momma don't mind
If we have another dance here
Just one more
One more time
Oh won't you stay
Just a little bit longer
Please, please, please, please, please
Tell me that you're gonna

There ain't no good in our goodbye-ing
True love takes a lot of trying
Oh, I'm crying
--- Unknown ---
Let's hang on
To what we've got
Don't let go girl
We've got a lot
Got a lot of love between us
Hang on, hang on, hang on
To what we've got
Doo doo, doo doo, doo doo
--- Unknown ---
You say you're gonna go and call it quits
Gonna chuck it all and break our love to bits
I wish you'd never said it
No, no, we'll both regret it
Baby
Baby
Baby

(Let's hang on)
Let's hang on
To what we've got
Don't let go girl
We've got a lot
Got a lot of love between us
Hang on, hang on, hang on
To what we've got
Doo doo, doo doo, doo doo

I can see
There ain't no room for me
You're only holding
Out your heart in sympathy
If there's another man
Then girl I understand
Go on and take his hand
And don't you worry 'bout me
--- Unknown ---
I'll be blue
And I'll be crying too
But girl you know
I only want what's best for you
What good is all my pride
If our true love has died
Go on and be his bride
And don't you worry 'bout me
--- Unknown ---
I'll be strong
I'll try to carry on
Although you know
It won't be easy when you're gone
I'll always think of you
The tender love we knew
But somehow I'll get through
So don't you worry 'bout me
--- Unknown ---
Bye bye baby, baby goodbye
Bye bye baby, don't make me cry
--- Unknown ---
You're the one girl in town not married
Girl, I'd marry you now if I were free
I wish it could be-e-e-e
I could love you but why begin it
'Cause there ain't any future in it
She's got me and I'm not free
--- Unknown ---
So bye bye baby, goodbye
Bye bye baby, don't make me cry
Bye baby, bye
Why make me cry?
Bye baby, baby bye bye
--- Unknown ---
Ahh
