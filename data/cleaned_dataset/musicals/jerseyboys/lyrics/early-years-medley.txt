------ Early Years Medley ------
--- Unknown ---
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah hut-hut
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah hut-hut
--- [TOMMY ---
That's our song. Oh What A Night. Ces soir?es-la. French.
Number one in Paris, 2000. How'd that happen? You ask four guys, you get four different
versions. But this is where all of them start - Belleville, New Jersey.
A thousand years ago. Eisenhower, Rocky Marciano,
and a few guys under a street lamp singing somebody else's latest hit.]
--- Unknown ---
Lost control and rang your bell
I was sore
Let me in or else I'll beat
Down your door
When two strangers who had been
Two silhouettes on the shade
Said to my shock,
You're on the wrong block
--- Unknown ---
Silhouettes (silhouettes)
Silhouettes (silhouettes)
Silhouettes (silhouettes)
Wa-oh-oh-oh
--- Unknown ---
Silhouettes (silhouettes)
Silhouettes (silhouettes)
Silhouettes (silhouettes)
Wa-oh-oh-oh
--- Unknown ---
Darlin', my darlin', my darlin', my darlin', darlin'
Darlin', my darlin', my darlin', my darlin', darlin'
--- [TOMMY ---
Our brass ring turns out to be a kid who sings like an angel.
He hangs around the clubs. So I set up a little surprise for him.]
--- Unknown ---
Bom-bom-bom-bom
Bom-bom-bom-bom
Bom-bom-bom-bom-bom
--- Unknown ---
You're the apple of my ey-ey-eye
--- [TOMMY ---
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen! We're the Variety Trio!
Three, four-! And now, a new discovery of mine; little Frankie Castelluccio!]
--- Unknown ---
I can't give you anything but love
Baby
That's the only thing I've plenty of
Baby
Dream awhile
Scheme awhile
We're sure to find
Happiness
And I guess
All those things you've always pined for
Gee, I'd like to see you looking swell
Baby
--- [TOMMY ---
Groups are growing on trees, but this kid could do it for us. Sure, he's green,
but that's where I come in. I take this raw clay and I make like Michaelangelo.
I got a few years on him, so I've got a lot to teach him. It's like my mission.
--- Unknown ---
Listen, Frankie, Tuesday night me and my brother Nick are going to knock
over Fixer's Jewelry Store over on Frenchtown Road. Around midnight. You in, or what?
--- FRANKIE ---
I dunno, my dad wants me home by eleven.
--- TOMMY ---
Tell him we're rehearsing. I figure your cut will be a hundred and fifty. Maybe two.
--- Unknown ---
He's a good kid. He just needs a little, you know, guidance.
--- MAN 1 ---
That jog your memory?
--- MAN 2 ---
Frankie, you're driving Tommy's car,
you've got no license - it's one block from where they hit Fixer's!
--- MAN 1 ---
We got Tommy and his brother. They already gave you up, numbnuts.
--- FRANKIE ---
I dunno what you're talking about.
--- MAN 1 ---
Have it your way.
--- JUDGE ---
How old are you?
--- FRANKIE ---
Sixteen, your honour.
--- JUDGE ---
I'm letting you off with a warning. I suggest you get yourself a new set of friends.
Now get out of here.
--- TOMMY ---
Frankie - sing good.
--- JUDGE ---
Kid's a singer?
--- TOMMY ---
A good singer. And getting better.
--- JUDGE ---
Then he ought to be great by the time you get out. Six months.]
--- Unknown ---
Oh, earth angel
Earth angel
The one I adore
Love you forever
And ever more
--- [GIRL ---
Nicky, for God's sakes! What are we doing in church?
I thought we were going to the movies!
--- NICK ---
Relax, will you? The kid's ready to play a big room!]
--- Unknown ---
I-I want a Sunday kind of love
A love to last past Saturday night
I'm glad to know
It's more than love at first sight
I want a Sunday kind of love
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
--- Unknown ---
I do my Sunday dreaming
And all my Sunday scheming
Every minute
Every hour
Every day-ay-ay
I'm hoping to discover
A certain kind of lover
--- [MARY ---
So that's your real name? Valli?
--- FRANKIE ---
Nah - Castelluccio. Francis Castelluccio.
--- MARY ---
Kind of long for a marquee.
--- FRANKIE ---
That's why I changed it. Vally. V-A-L-L-Y.
--- MARY ---
No, V-A-L-L-I!
--- FRANKIE ---
How come?
--- MARY ---
Because you're Italian! You've gotta end in a vowel. Delgad-O, Castellucci-O, pizz-A.
Vall-I. With an I. It says, This is who I am. You don't like it? You can go fuck yourself.
--- DECARLO ---
Hey, Frankie - sing me My Mother's Eyes.
--- FRANKIE ---
Gee, Mr. DeCarlo. I haven't done that song since I was fifteen.
--- DECARLO ---
Frankie, let me explain how this works. You do a favor for me - one day, I'll do a favor for you.
--- FRANKIE ---
Sure, Mr. DeCarlo.]
--- Unknown ---
One bright and guiding light
That taught me wrong from right
I found in my mother's eyes
--- Unknown ---
Just like a wandering sparrow
One lo-o-onely soul
I walk the straight and narrow
To reach my goal
--- [TOMMY ---
So it's me, Nick, and Frankie, and it's up to me to keep us out of the gutter.
But nobody's hiring trios anymore. Quartets are in. So, I'm looking for a
fourth guy so we can get some work.
--- JOEY ---
Tommy! I got your fourth guy! You're gonna thank me for this - he's a genius!
--- TOMMY ---
What's his name?
--- JOEY ---
Guardio. Bob Guardio. He's a kid, but he plays like a madman.
And he writes songs!]
--- Unknown ---
Who wears short shorts?
They're such short shorts
Who wears short shorts?
--- [JOEY ---
Bobby! Bobby! Hey, listen! The Three Lovers - they got this kid singer - he's like,
forget about it! And they're dying to meet you!
--- BOB ---
Why?
--- JOEY ---
Because I told them you're a fucking genius!]
--- Unknown ---
There I go, there I go
There I go, there I go
Pretty baby, you are the soul
Who snaps my control
Such a funny thing
That every time I'm near you
I never can behave
You give me a smile
And then I'm wrapped up in your magic
--- [BOB ---
I dropped out of high school to tour with Short Shorts.
I shared a bus with Chuck Berry, Sam Cooke, the Everly Brothers, Jackie Wilson...
but I never heard a voice like Frankie Valli's. After eight bars, I know I need to write for this voice.]
--- Unknown ---
Brightest stars that shine up above you
In the clear blue skies
How I worry 'bout you
Just can't live my life without you
Baby come here
Don't have no fear
Is there a wonder why
I'm really feeling
I-in the-e moo-ood fo-or love
--- [TOMMY ---
Nick Massi, Frankie Vallie; Bob- what is it?
--- BOB ---
Guardio. Hi.
--- NICK & FRANKIE ---
Hi.
--- TOMMY ---
Somebody said you write.
--- JOEY ---
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I told you! Can't we just borrow the piano for a minute?
Go ahead, Bobby. Play the new one.]
