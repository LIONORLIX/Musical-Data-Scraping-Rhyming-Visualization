------ Big Man In Town ------
--- Unknown ---
Big man in town...
--- Unknown ---
Each day as I grow older,
The nights are getting colder.
Some day the sun will shine on me.
Money, I don't have any:
I'm down to my last penny,
But, darling, don't cry over me:
--- Unknown ---
I'll be a big man in town (honest, honey)
I'll be a big man in town (promise, darling)
I'll be a big man in town, just you wait and see:
You'll be proud of me.
--- Unknown ---
They think that I'm a rover,
But my roving days are over.
Someday your folks will welcome me.
I went away a small man,
But I'll come home a tall man.
Then what a pretty bride you'll be.
--- Unknown ---
I'll be a big man in town (honest, honey)
I'll be a big man in town (promise, darling)
I'll be a big man in town, just you wait and see:
You'll be proud of me.
--- Unknown ---
I'm gonna make it, just wait and see.
I'm gonna make it, just wait and see.
Just wait and see,
