------ Fallen Angel ------
--- Frankie ---
You're home again,
Glad you kept the key
Been waitin' here
seems a million years to me,
but, hush now,
I know you're all cried out
It's alright
inside I've had no doubt about
your love for me
I can see behind the tears
I certain of the way we feel
and given time the hurt will heal
--- Unknown ---
You're home again,
so won't you close the door
stay here with me,
and we'll forget what's gone before
just hold on tight
our love is gonna make it if I
put shadows way beyond recall
The ghost has almost gone
--- Unknown ---
Fallen Angel
I'll forgive you anything
you can't help the things you do
now, something's gotten hold of you
Fallen Angel
Got a demon in your soul
And later when the fever's gone
I'll be here where you belong.

[Spoken]
It's been more than 20 years
since these guys were on the same stage together
and what better stage for a reunion
than the one right here at the Rock-n-Roll hall of fame.
Ladies and gentlemen, My old friends and brand new Hall-of-Famers,
