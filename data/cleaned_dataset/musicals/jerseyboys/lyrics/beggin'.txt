Frankie-
Ridin' high when I was king
Playnin' it hard and fast cause I had everything
Walked away, and warned me then
That easy come and easy go and it would end
--- Unknown ---
(Group- All 4)
I need you to understand
That I'm trying so hard to be your man
The kind of man you'd want in the end
Only then can I begin to live again

Frankie-
An empty shell of I used to be
The shadow of my life is hangin' over me
A Broken man without a goal
Don't even stand a, Devil's chance to win my soul

(Group-3) & Frankie

(Group - All 4)
I'm fightin' hard to hold my own
No, I just can't make it all alone
I'm holdin' on, I can't fall back
Now that big brass ring is a shade of black
