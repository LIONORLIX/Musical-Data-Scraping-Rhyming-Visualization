(Bo-bo, doo-doot-doo-doo-doo-doo)
--- Unknown ---
There goes my baby, movin' on down the line
Wonder where, wonder where, wonder where she is bound?
I broke her heart and made her cry
Now I'm alone, so all alone
What can I do, what can I do?
--- Unknown ---
(There goes my baby) Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh
(There goes my baby) Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(There goes my baby) Whoa-oh-oh-oh
--- Unknown ---
I wanna know if she loved me
Did she really love me?
Was she just playing me for a fool?
--- Unknown ---
I wonder why she left me
Why did she leave me so all alone
So all alone
--- Unknown ---
I was gonna tell her that I loved her
And that I need her
Beside my side to be my guide
--- Unknown ---
I wanna know where is my (doo-doot-doo-doo-doo-doo)
Where is my baby (doo-doot-doo-doo-doo-doo) ?
I want my baby
I need my baby
--- Unknown ---
Yeah, whoa-oh-oh
