------ Stand by Me ------
--- Unknown ---
When the night has come
And the land is dark
And the moon
Is the only light we'll see
--- Unknown ---
No, I won't be afraid
No, I won't be afraid
Just as long as you stand
Stand by me
--- Unknown ---
So, darling, darling stand by me,
Oh, stand by me,
Oh stand, stand by me, stand by me
--- Unknown ---
If the sea that we look upon
Should tumble and fall
--- Unknown ---
Or if the mountain should crumble in the sea
--- Unknown ---
I won't cry, no, I won't cry
No I won't shed a tear
--- Unknown ---
Just as long, as you stand
Stand by me
So darling, darling stand by me
Oh, stand by me
Oh stand, stand by me
