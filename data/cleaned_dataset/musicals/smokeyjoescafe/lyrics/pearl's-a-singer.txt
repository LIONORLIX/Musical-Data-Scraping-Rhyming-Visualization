Pearl's a singer
She stands up when she plays the piano
In a nightclub
Pearl's a singer
She sings songs for the lost and lonely
Her job is entertaining folks
Singing songs and telling jokes
In a nightclub
Pearl's a singer
And they say that she once was a winner
in a contest
Pearl's a singer
And they say that she once cut a record
They played it for a week or so
On the local radio
It never made it
She wanted to be Betty Grable
But now she sits there at that beer stained table
Dreaming of the things she never got to do
All those dreams that never came true
Pearl's a singer
She stands up when she plays the piano
In a nightclub
Pearl's a singer
She sings songs for the lost and the lonely
Her job is entertaining folks
Singing songs and telling jokes
