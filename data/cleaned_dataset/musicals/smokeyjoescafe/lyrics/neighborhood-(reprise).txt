------ Neighborhood (Reprise) ------
--- WOMAN'S CHORUS ---
Here's a photo I've been looking for
It's a picture of the boy next door
And I loved him more than words can say
Never knew it 'til he moved away
--- Unknown ---
Faded pictures in my scrapbook
Just thought I'd take one more look
And recall when we were all
