Stay awhile, let me hold you
Stay awhile, 'till I've told you oh oh
Of the love that I feel tonight oh yeah

Stay awhile what's your hurry?
Stay awhile, 'cause I worry oh oh
Any time that you're out of sight

I hate to see you go Tell you what I'll do I'll be good to you
I'll make you glad that you are mine, so come on baby
--- Unknown ---
Treat me right, must you run now
For the night's just begun now oh oh
