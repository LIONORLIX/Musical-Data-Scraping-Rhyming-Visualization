------ Love Me/Don't ------
--- Unknown ---
Treat me like a fool,
Treat me mean and cruel,
But love me.
Wring my faithful heart,
Tear it all apart,
But love me.
If you ever go,
Darling, I'll be oh so lonely
I'll be sad and blue,
Crying over you, dear only.
I would beg and steal
Just to feel your heart
Beatin' close to mine
Well, if you ever go,
Darling, I'll be oh so lonely
I'll be sad and blue,
Crying over you, dear only.
I would beg and steal
Just to feel your heart
Beatin' close to mine
Well, if you ever go,
Darling, I'll be oh so lonely
Beggin' on knees,
All I ask is please, please love me
Oh yeah

Don't, don't, that's what you say
Each time that I hold you this way,
When I feel like this and I want to hold you,
baby, don't say don't.
--- Unknown ---
Don't, don't leave my embrace
For here in my arms is your place
When the night grows cold and I want to hold you,
baby, don't say don't.
--- Unknown ---
If you think that this is just a game
I'm playing
If you think that I don't mean
ev'ry word I'm saying
Don't, don't, don't, don't,
Don't feel that way
I'm your love and yours I will stay
This you can believe
I will never leave you
Heave knows I won't
