------ Some Cats Know ------
--- Unknown ---
The old prospectors nose for gold
the sailor who can read the sky
the gamblers sense of when to fold
the trick to making apple pie
these mysteries one cannot explain
this old black art
so queer and quaint
like making love, or making rain
either you got it,
or
you
aint
--- Unknown ---
Some cats know

they don't come on huffin and puffin
and grabbin and clutchin
some cats know
how to take it nice and slow
but if a cat don't know
a cat don't know
--- Unknown ---
some cats know
how to stir up the feelin
they keep foolin round
till they're half way to the celin
some cats know
how to make the honey flow
but if a cat don't know
a cat don't know
--- Unknown ---
some cats know just where it's at
they are not like some others
I would ruther one like that
If I had my druthers
--- Unknown ---
Some cats know
how to play nice and pretty
nice and soft
and soon you're off to

some cats know
how to take it nice and slow
but if a cat don't know

--- Unknown ---
