------ Dance With Me ------
--- MEN'S CHORUS ---
Dance with me, dance with me, dance with me, dance with me
--- KEN ---
Dance with me,
Hold me closer, closer and closer
Much closer while the music plays, my little darlin', won't ya
Dance with me,
Hold me tighter, tighter and tighter
Much tighter while the rhythm sways
--- Unknown ---
Put your lips to mine while the music plays
We're no longer strangers
Now we're more than friends so-o-o
--- Unknown ---
Dance with me, dance with me closer, closer and closer
And maybe we'll be lovers when the music ends
--- Unknown ---
(Doot-doot) (Dance with me) oh-oh
(Doot-doot) (Dance with me) oh-oh
(Doot-doot) (Dance with me) oh-oh
(Doot-doot) (Dance with me) oh-oh
--- D.J. ---
Dance with me,
Hold me closer, closer and closer
Much closer while the music plays,
My little darlin', won't ya
Dance with me,
Hold me tighter and tighter and tighter
Much tighter while the rhythm sways
--- Unknown ---
Ooh, ooh,
Put your lips to mine while the music plays
We're no longer strangers
Now we're more than friends
--- Unknown ---
Dance with me, dance with me closer, closer and closer
