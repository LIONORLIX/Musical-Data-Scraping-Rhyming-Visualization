------ Poison Ivy ------
--- Unknown ---
She comes on like a rose
but everybody knows
she'll get you in Dutch
you can look but you'd better not touch
--- Unknown ---
Poison Ivy
Poison Ivy
Late at night while you're sleeping
Poison Ivy comes creeping around
--- Unknown ---
She's pretty as a daisy
but look out man she's crazy
she'll really do you in
if you let her get under your skin
--- Unknown ---
Measles make you mumpy
and mumps will make you lumpy
and chicken pox will make you
jump and switch
--- Unknown ---
A common cold will fool you
and whooping cough can cool ya
But Poison Ivy lord will make you itch
--- Unknown ---
Your gonna need an ocean
of calamine lotion
You'll be scratching like a hound
the minute you start to mess around
--- Unknown ---
