------ Trouble ------
--- Unknown ---
If you're looking for trouble,
you came to the right place.
If you're looking for trouble,
just look right in my face.
I was born standing up,
and talking back,
my daddy was a green eyed mountain jack.
I don't look for trouble,
but I never ran.
I don't take no orders,
from no kind of man.
I'm only made out of flesh blood and bone,
if you want to start a rumble,
don't you try it all alone
--- Unknown ---
Because I'm evil,
my middle name is misery.
I said I'm evil,
so don't you mess around with me
