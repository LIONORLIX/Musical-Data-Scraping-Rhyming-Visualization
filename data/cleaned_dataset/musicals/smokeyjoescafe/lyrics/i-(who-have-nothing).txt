------ I (Who Have Nothing) ------
--- Unknown ---
I, I who have nothing
I, I who have no one
Adore you, and want you so
I'm just a no one,
With nothing to give you but, oh
I Love You
He, He buys you diamonds
Bright, sparkling diamonds
But believe me, dear when I say,
That he can give you the world,
But he'll never love you the way
I Love You
--- Unknown ---
He can take you anyplace he wants
To fancy clubs and restaurants
Where I can only watch you with
My nose pressed up against the window pane
--- Unknown ---
I, I who have nothing
I, I who have no one
Must watch you, go dancing by
Wrapped in the arms of somebody else
When darling it's I
Who Loves you
I Love You
I Love You
