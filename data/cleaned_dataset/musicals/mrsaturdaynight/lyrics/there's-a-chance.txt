------ There's A Chance ------
--- SUSAN ---
I'm not high or in jail
I don't need to make bail
I'm not pregnant, I swear, I'm just glowing
With excitement I can't keep from showing
'Cause it looks like I may have a job
--- Unknown ---
There's an opening slot
For a permanent spot
And they gave me a definite maybe
Of course, everyone else is baby
It's not grand but I won’t be a snob
There's a chance
There's a chance
I’ll be finally using my skills
I could make my own way
But you’ll still pay my analyst bills
--- Unknown ---
There's a chance
There's a chance
I might finally see something through
And if I g?t this chance
There’s a chanc? you'll be proud of me too
--- Unknown ---
(spoken)
It's in PR.
--- BUDDY, spoken ---
Puerto Rico?
--- SUSAN, spoken ---
No, dad, ugh. Public relations.
--- BUDDY, spoken ---
Oh.
--- ELAINE, spoken ---
Oh, honey, that's—that could be wonderful.
[SUSAN]
I'd be in a good space
I could get a nice place
With a roommate or two if I need to
And who knows what else it could lead to
Once I get that job in my midst!
--- Unknown ---
Nicer clothes I could buy
I could meet a nice guy
One who isn't a cheat or a stealer
Or gay, or my boss, or my dealer
Man, my picker's sure been on the fritz!
--- Unknown ---
There's a chance
There's a chance
Though I know nothing's written in stone
It may be that I am not fated to die
Bitter, broke, and alone
--- Unknown ---
There's a chance
There's a chance
That my life could be happy somehow
Had this stuff with the feds and my meds
But I'm much better now
--- BUDDY, spoken ---
What's it pay?
[SUSAN, spoken]
Ha, there it is, you see? I'm leaving.
--- BUDDY, spoken ---
Don’t leave. It's a normal question about a job. What does it pay?
--- SUSAN, spoken ---
It pays ten cents a year, okay? That's what it pays. It pays ten cents a year.
--- BUDDY, spoken ---
Okay, that’s something. It’s ten cents more than you made last year.
--- SUSAN ---
Why, after I came back from my latest slip
I managed to pick up my ninety day chip
Do you put a price tag on what I’m worth?
Now, here comes this chance for a job in my line
It's nothing fancy but it would be mine
You've ruined my first forty years on this earth
--- Unknown ---
That's all you’re allowed
You don't get the pleasure of making me cry
If you can't be proud
Can’t you just lie?
Lie
--- Unknown ---
There's a chance
There's a ch—-
Ugh, why am I wasting my breath?
I'm spinning my wheels
It's okay, no big deal
Hey, it's just life or death
--- Unknown ---
There's a chance
There's a chance
I might finally see something through
I'm not taking drugs
And I'm not robbing banks
And if I get this job
By the seat of my spanx
It'll be no thanks to you!
--- ELAINE, spoken ---
Susie, stay!
