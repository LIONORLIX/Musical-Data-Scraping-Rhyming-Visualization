------ A Little Joy ------
--- BUDDY, spoken ---
Good morning. Do any of you remember that music? That was the theme song from my television show back in 1955, Saturday Nights, eight o'clock on CBS. Anybody remember that?
--- Unknown ---
Anybody remember breakfast?
--- Unknown ---
Anybody remember anything?
--- Unknown ---
Oh boy, this is gonna be work.

(sung)
I'm here to bring a little joy
I'm here to have a little fun
I'm here to crack a little joke
A little dig, a little poke
And leave you happy when I'm done
I'm here to bring a little smile
So l?ave your troubles for a while
It's just a gift I'v? had since I was a boy
To bring you all a little joy
Oh, Jesus Christ.
--- Unknown ---
Let me ask you something folks. You all came here on purpose, right? You didn't like, lose a bet, or anything? Okay, good.
--- Unknown ---
(sung)
I'm here to share a couple laughs
I'm here to make you all convulse
I'm here to bring a little mirth
To celebrate our time on earth
Of course it helps to have a pulse
Folks, if you're having a good time, tell your face.
Im here to make you feel at ease
What, am I speaking in Chinese?
So the other day my wife yells down at me, she says, Buddy, come upstairs and make love to me! I said, make up your mind, I can't do both.
--- Unknown ---
(sung)
Sharing the gift of laughter
You'll live happily ever after
So that even when life gets tough it pulls you through
When I'm singing the blues and got 'em
And I feel like I've hit the bottom
I think, Hey, it could be worse, I could be you!
Come on, give me something. I know you're out there, I can hear you decomposing.
--- Unknown ---
I know it's tough when you get older. A lot of you are very sad. I understand some of you are still sitting shiva for Lincoln.
--- Unknown ---
You know when you're really old? When somebody comes up to you and they say, "Hey, I like your alligator shoes," and you're barefoot.
--- Unknown ---
Well this has been a lovely ordeal.
--- Unknown ---
(sung)
I'm glad I brought a little joy
Your hearse is waiting at the door
I'm glad that I could bring some laughter and cheer
To everyone here
Except you, lady. Yeah, you. By the way, Moses called. He said you were a great fuck.
The world could use a little joy
