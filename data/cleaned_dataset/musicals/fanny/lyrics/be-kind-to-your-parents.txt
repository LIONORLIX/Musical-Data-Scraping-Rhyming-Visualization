------ Be Kind To Your Parents ------
--- Unknown ---
Be kind to your parents,
though they don't deserve it,
remember they're grownups
a difficult stage of life.
--- Unknown ---
They're apt to be nervous and overexcited
Confused by their daily storm and strife.
--- Unknown ---
Just keep in mind, though it sounds odd I know,
Most parents once were children long ago
(Incredible).
--- Unknown ---
So treat then with patience and sweet understanding,
in spite of the foolish things they do.20
