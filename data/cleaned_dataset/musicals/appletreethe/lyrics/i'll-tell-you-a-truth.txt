------ I'll Tell You A Truth ------
--- Narrator ---
I'll tell you a truth
That's hard to swallow.
I'll tell you a truth.
Oh, listen well.
If you are in love
With a lover who's jealous
Then sooner or later,
You're headed for Hell.
--- Unknown ---
So say goodbye,
And don't you wait
Because tomorrow
May be too late.
Yes, listen well
To what I say.
Tell jealous lovers
To go away.
--- Unknown ---
I'll tell you a tale
For you to ponder.
I'll tell you a tale,
Oh, listen well.
A curious tale
It tells of a princess,
And it tells of her lover
