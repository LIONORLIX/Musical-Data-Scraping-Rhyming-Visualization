------ I've Got What You Want ------
--- Unknown ---
I've got what you want
I've got what you need
I know how much you want it
Yeh! Yeh! Sanjar!
I know my father would kill me
If he knew
My heart was set, on giving
What i've got to you. Yeh ! Yeh !
--- Unknown ---
I know what i know
You need what i know
What's mine is yours
You know it. Yeh! Yeh! Sanjar!
You just might die
So i will give it to you
And when i give it to you
You'll shout for joy
And so will i !!
