------ The Apple Tree (Forbidden Fruit) ------
--- Unknown ---
Listen closely. Let me fill you in
About the rich ripe round red
Rosy apples the call forbidden fruit
What i'm about to say is
Confidential so promise you'll be mute.
Because if every creature in the garden knows
They'll come 'round like hungry buffalos
And in no time there'll be none of those
Precious apples left for you and me.
--- Unknown ---
Now in the average apple
You're accustomed to skin, seeds, flesh and core
But you will find that these are
Special apples that give you something more
Why, every seed contains some information you
Need to speed your education, the
Seeds, indeed, of all creation are here
Why, be foolish my dear
Come with me
To that tree.
--- Unknown ---
With every sweet and juicy
Luscious bite of this not forbidden fruit
You'll see your mind expand and
Your perceptions grow more and more acute
--- Unknown ---
And you can teach him plumbing and philosophy
New techniques for glazing pottery
Wood-craft, first-aid, home economy
Madam, adam will be overjoyed!
--- Unknown ---
When he becomes aware of
Your attainments he'll beam with loving pride
And he will say,
--- Unknown ---
"o, eve, you're
Indispensable! Please, don't leave my side!
And with your nifty,new-found education, he'll
Relish every conversation,why
You'll be adam's inspiration this way!
Just an apple a day
Wait and see
Come with me
To that tree!
Now!
