------ I Know ------
--- Unknown ---
Look at me I'm a movie star.
Every inch a movie star.
A beautiful, galmorous ...
--- Unknown ---
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
Passionella how I love you ...
I know.
If you knew how I adore you ...
I know.
I can't sleep at night for thinking about you ...
It's understandable.
I want you, I want you, I want you ...
It must be awful.
--- Unknown ---
Did you know I stole your slippers?
I knew.
Pictures of you fill my bedroom ...
Mine too.
I don't love Sofia,
I don't love Bardot.
I love Passionella ...
I know.
--- Unknown ---
Passionella you're my idol ...
Of course.
--- Unknown ---
How I long to look like you do ...
You should.
I've read every word they've written about you ...
You're not the only one.
In private you are me and I am you.
That's what I'm here for.
--- Unknown ---
As a goddess you're immortal, oh ...
Let me touch your sacred body, oh ...
We'll be right here waiting everywhere you go.
You cannot escape us!
