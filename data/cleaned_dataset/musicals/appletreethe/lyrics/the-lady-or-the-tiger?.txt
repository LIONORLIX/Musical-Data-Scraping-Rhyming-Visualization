I'll tell you a truth,
That's hard to swallow.
I'll tell you a truth,
Oh listen well.
If you are in love,
with a lover who's jealous.
Then sooner or later you're headed for hell!
--- Unknown ---
So say goodbye,
And don't you wait.
Because tomorrow may be to late.
Yes listen well.
To what I say.
Tell jealous lovers,
To go away.
--- Unknown ---
I'll tell you a tale,
For you to ponder.
I'll tell you a tale,
oh listen well.
A curious tale,
It tells of a princess.
And it tells of her lover
and all that befell.
