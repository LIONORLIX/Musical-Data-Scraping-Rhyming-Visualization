But, was Passionella truly content?
Let's hear the answer in her own words.
--- Unknown ---
Wealth!
How delicious to be so rounded.
By the comforts and luxuries.
That I've never known before.
--- Unknown ---
Fame!
I'm a figure of world importance.
I'm the center of every crowd.
Who could ask for more?
--- Unknown ---
Fans, fans, fans,fans, fans!
When I see my adoring public.
I remember the girl I was.
All alone and on the shelf.
--- Unknown ---
Success!
I was nothing, now I'm something.
I am envied by everyone.
I envy me myself.
--- Unknown ---
Glamour and excitement!
Lucky me a movie star.
I was made for caviar.
And that's what I've got.
--- Unknown ---
My life is exactly what I wished for.
So of course I must be truly content.
