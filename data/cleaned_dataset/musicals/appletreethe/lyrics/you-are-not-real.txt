The newspapers call you
The goddess of sex
If you are a goddess
I'm oedipus rex
Neither goddess nor woman
You're something apart
With a silicone body
And a digital heart.
Instead of a soul
You got a sign, sayin'

How does it feel
To be the world's ideal
When you know an' i know
That you are not real-real-real
You are not real.

The sons of old adam
Have reasons to grieve
Since we took a look at
You daughters of eve
You don't know what's honest
You don't know what's true
I'll tell you what's real
It's the least i can do.
Dirty fingernails is real
An' strag-ga-ly hair
An' slovenly clothes
An' a air of despair

I'm weary of glamour
An' women like you
I long for a woman
Who's real through and through
No goddess will ever
Get my heart to throb
For the girl of my dreams
Is a slob.

How does it feel
To be the world's ideal

That you are not--
You are not--
You are not--
Real!!!
