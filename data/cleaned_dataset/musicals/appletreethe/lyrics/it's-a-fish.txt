------ It's A Fish ------
--- Unknown ---
I just got back from a hunting trip up north and found that
Eve caught some new kind of animal!
--- Unknown ---
Now I could swear that its a fish though it resembles us in every way, but size.
She gives it milk and every night she picks it up and pats and pets it when it cries.
I always knew she'd pity fish, but its ridiculous to make them household pets.
--- Unknown ---
She says its not a fish.
I say it is a fish cause it surrounds itself with water almost every chance it gets.
--- Unknown ---
Its not a fish. Fish never scream and this one does on occasion it say goo.
Its legs are long, its arms are short,
So I suspect its a kind of kangaroo.
And Since it came, I pity Eve,
shes gotten madder by the minute and it shows.
--- Unknown ---
Just now I said to her,
that I would much prefer to have it stuffed for my collection
and she punched me in the nose!
--- Unknown ---
It's growing teeth and it can bite!
And I'm convinced what we have here is a bear.
I'm worried sick, but Eve is not.
She burnt the muzzle I made for it to wear.
I've searched the woods, I baited traps,
but yet I couldn't find its sister or its brother!
--- Unknown ---
And though I've hunted far and wide!
While Eve heartily stepped outside!
