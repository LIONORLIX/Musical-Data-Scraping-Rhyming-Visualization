------ Beautiful, Beautiful World ------
--- Unknown ---
I see animals and birds and flowers,
Ev 'ry color, ev'ry shape and size;
Moss and pebbles and a host of wonders,
Gleaming ev 'ry where I aim my eyes.
Soif ever I'm attacked by boredom,
I'll just open up my eyes and see
This diversified, curious, fascinating, bountiful,
Beautiful, beautiful world.
--- Unknown ---
I hear chattering and I hear chirping,
Whistling, murmuring and horks and snorts;
When I simply take the time to listen.
I hear music of a thousand sorts.
So if ever Iwould rest my eyes,
My ears can easily describe to me
This diversified, curious, fascinating bountiful,
Beautiful, beautiful world.
--- Unknown ---
Stlll it's possible a day may come,
When momentarily the world wears thin;
IfI weary of the world outside me,
I can always take a good look in.
For along with ev'ry cloud and cobweb.
I'm emphatic'ly a member of
This diversified, curious, fascinating bountiful,
Beautiful world, I love you.

World, thank you very much for all I see, hear, taste and touch;
Plus ev'ry whiff I sniff. *(Snift)*
