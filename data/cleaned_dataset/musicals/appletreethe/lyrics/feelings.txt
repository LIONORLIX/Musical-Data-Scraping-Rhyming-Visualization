------ Feelings ------
--- Unknown ---
Feelings are tumbling over feelings
Feelings i do not understand
And i am more than slightly worried
That they are getting out of hand
--- Unknown ---
Sometimes they happen in my stomach
Sometimes they happen on my skin
What is the name of this condition
That i am in?
--- Unknown ---
If i'm more objective and observant
If i can keep an even keel
I'll be the first to pin a name to
What i am the very first to feel
--- Unknown ---
I am the first to face this problem.
I am the first to have this dream.
How can i harvest his attention?
How can i harvest his esteem?
Should i something different with my hair?
Is there some tid-bit that will please him?
What should i wear?
What is the source of this congestion
That i must learn to rise above?
Is there a name for this condition?
Yes there's a name......
An it is hell!
