------ The Apple Tree (Reprise) ------
--- Unknown ---
I must advise your proudness,
There are things it is better not to know.
If you insist your proudness,
Then of course I will tell you even so.
--- Unknown ---
You will not reconsider,
You are certain you want this knowledge.
Though I warn you against this knowledge,
Be it on your own head!
--- Unknown ---
What's forbidden to know.
You shall know.
