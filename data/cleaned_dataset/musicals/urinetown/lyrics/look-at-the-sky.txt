------ Look At The Sky ------

Penny
You've got a sweet lookin' head, Bobby, a sweet lookin' head! But you
keep it up there in the clouds day after day after day and it's gotta
come down from there. You hear me?! Get that head out of the clouds,
Bobby Strong! You get it out of the clouds!

Bobby
Off in the distance
There's a beautiful horizon -
Gleaming and radiant
It's what I'll keep my eyes on -
As the world turns to face the sun
And start another day
It suddenly
Occurs to me
That maybe we can find another way
Look at the sky
Full of hope and promise
It's a shining ideal
How I reel
When I look at the sky
--- Unknown ---
Daily we make them pay
Their nickles dimes and quarters -
Daily we break them
'Cause we have to follow orders
And we keep filling moneybags
With broken lives and dreams
But what's it for?
I can't ignore
These black immoral
Profit-making schemes
--- Unknown ---
Look at the sky
High above this madness!
Here below feel our shame!
It must stop in the name
Of the sky!

The fee is the law, Bobby Strong.

Bobby
And what if there was a new law in town, Ms. Pennywise? A new law that
didn't come from any voting process or elected body or process of
judicial review, but a brand new law that came from an organ. That's
right, a muscular, blood-pumping organ. Like this one. Right here.

Penny
A muscular organ?
--- Unknown ---
Bobby
Can't you see it, Ms. Pennywise? Well, if this one's too small for you
why not try this one on for size?!
--- Unknown ---
Penny
It's...it's blinding me!
--- Unknown ---
Bobby
Look at the sky!
There's a great big heart there!
There's a heart
In the sky
There just is
Don't ask why -
It's the sky!
--- Unknown ---
Penny
Don't do this, Bobby. You'll regret it.
--- Unknown ---
Bobby
I don't think so. C'mon, Ma. This one's on the house. For everyone!
Forever!

Tell me where!

Look at the sky!
That's our inspiration! Bobby
Look at the sky!
Look at the sky!
--- Unknown ---
The Poor
We can win
If we try
We begin
When we look at the sky!
--- Unknown ---
Penny
Oh Bobby, what's to become of you? What's to become of us all?!
--- Unknown ---
The Poor
Look at the sky!
Standard of the people! Bobby
Off in the distance
There's a beautiful horizon
--- Unknown ---
The Poor
It's a banner so wide
Flying proudly with pride
In the sky
