------ Cop Song ------

Lockstock
If there's one thing I've learned in my many years of enforcing the laws
of this city, it's that the journey down to Urinetown offers no
surprises. Not even from the very toughest amongst us. On that journey
expect only the expected.
--- Unknown ---
It's a hard, cold, tumble of a journey
Worthy of a gurney, a bumble down
A slapped face, smacked with a mace
Certain to debase is our stumble down
--- Unknown ---
It's a path that leads you only one place
Horrible to retrace, a crumble down
A hard, cold, tumble of a tourney
Jumble of a journey to Urinetown
--- Unknown ---

And Joseph Old Man Strong
Held his pee for much too long
Hoped his son might bail him out
His guess was good but also wrong!
--- Unknown ---
Lockstock
Years past all lived in a jungle
Scooping out a bungle, nature's bowl
Life of constant deprivation
Certain aggravation took its toll
--- Unknown ---
Soon learned power of the truncheon
Organize a function king to pawn
So if peace is what you're after
Urinetown's the rafter to hang it on!
