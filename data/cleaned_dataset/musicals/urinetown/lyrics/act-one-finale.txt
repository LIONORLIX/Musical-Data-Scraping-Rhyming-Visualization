Bobby
Free!
People are free!
How can a fee
Enslave us?
See
How we can be
Free from the chains
He gave us!
--- Unknown ---
We're suffering now
Such lives of sorrow
Don't give us tomorrow
Just give us today!
--- Unknown ---
The Poor
Free!
People are free!
How can a fee
Enslave us?
See
How we can be
Free from the chains
He gave us!
--- Unknown ---
We're suffering now
Such lives of sorrow
Don't give us tomorrow
Just give us today!
--- Unknown ---
Bobby
From ev'ry hill
Ev'ry steeple
Ring out the anthem
Of the people
Making a new way
Breaking the clouds of gray
To sing of today!
--- Unknown ---
Bobby and The Poor
Sing of today!
Sing of today
Sing today
Sing today
Sing today
--- Unknown ---
Cladwell
A little brutality is exactly what these people need. Officer Lockstock!
--- Unknown ---
Hope
Daddy, wait. He only wants the people to be happy.
--- Unknown ---
Cladwell
Happy you say?! Happy?!
--- Unknown ---
So you want happy, Mister Strong?
Did you say happy, Mister Strong?
If they pee today I'm sure they'll be
As happy as a pup
With no rules and no more fees to pay
Things would be looking up!
But too bad the water that we share
Could fit inside a cup!
What of tomorrow, Mister Strong?
--- Unknown ---
Bobby
But what of today?!
--- Unknown ---
Cladwell
But what of tomorrow, Mister Strong?!
Think of tomorrow, Mister Strong!
Our resources are as fragile
As a newborn baby's skull
With your actions
You would gut the child
And leave a lifeless hull!
Could it be you're so short-sighted
So insensitive, so dull?
Think of tomorrow, Mister Strong!
--- Unknown ---
The Poor
But what of today?!
--- Unknown ---
Cladwell and Co.
You are wrong, Mister Strong
You and your socialistic throng
If the people pee for free
They'll push the system to the brink
If today there's spillage
Tell us how tomorrow will not stink!
--- Unknown ---
Cladwell
If it's you and me, now, Mister Strong
Which one of us will blink?
I say it's you, Mister Strong
For on the subject of tomorrow
--- Unknown ---
Cladwell and Co.
You are wrong!
--- Unknown ---
Hope
Oh, Bobby, why didn't you tell me you were going to start a revolution?
--- Unknown ---
Bobby
Maybe for the same reason you didn't tell me you were a Cladwell. So you
can join us or you can stand aside.
--- Unknown ---
Hope
Bobby, think!
You're standing on the brink!
You'll be arrested soon
Perhaps as soon as noon
--- Unknown ---
And I could never bear
To see you taken where
The guilty pee-ers meet
The toilet judgement seat!
--- Unknown ---
Bobby
You said
To follow your heart
Here's where my heart leads
Now I'll do my part
To banish all needs
--- Unknown ---
You made me to see
Fantastic'lly clear
When people pee free
We've nothing to fear
--- Unknown ---
Hope
Give up now!
We'll find a way
Somehow
To help the people pee
--- Unknown ---
Without a hefty fee
But if you must persist
Being an anarchist
My father's men will see
You're sent away from me!
You'll get Urinetown!
--- Unknown ---
Bobby, you'll get Urinetown!
--- Unknown ---
Off you'll go to Urinetown!
--- Unknown ---
Urinetown!
--- Unknown ---
Urinetown!
Bobby
Your words
Were like seeds
--- Unknown ---
At first they
Seemed mild
--- Unknown ---
They grew into deeds
--- Unknown ---
This riot's our child
--- Unknown ---
Sing of today, not tomorrow!
--- Unknown ---
End their lives of sorrow!
--- Unknown ---
Today!
--- Unknown ---
Today!
--- Unknown ---
Sing of today!
--- Unknown ---
Cladwell
You've picked a fight you can't win, today, Mr. Strong! Your rabble is
no match for my men.
--- Unknown ---
Little Sally
You can punish our bodies, Mr. Cladwell, but you can never punish our
spirits!
--- Unknown ---
Soupy Sue
Punish our bodies?!
--- Unknown ---
Little Becky Two Shoes
I never agreed to any punishment of my body!
--- Unknown ---
Cladwell
Oh, punishment is all you'll ever know!
--- Unknown ---
The Poor
Bobby, help!
He'll turn our brains to kelp!
No matter what we do
We're in a real bad stew!
Those cops look awful mean
Like none we've ever seen!
When Cladwell gives the cue
Our revolution's through! Cladwell and UGC Staff
You
Are wrong, Mr. Strong!
You
Are wrong, Mr. Strong!
Very
Wrong, Mr. Strong!
You
Are wrong, Mr. Strong!
--- Unknown ---
Bobby
Last night your words
Were like seeds
At first
They seemed mild
They grew
Into deeds
This riot's
Our child! The Poor
Bobby, please!
There's no way to appease
A raging maniac
A real insaniac
He's like a speeding train
Caught in a hurricane
But he is in control
And he is on a roll! Cladwell and UGC Staff
You
Are wrong, Mr. Strong!
You
Are wrong, Mr. Strong!
Very
Wrong, Mr. Strong!
You
Are wrong, Mr. Strong!
--- Unknown ---
Bobby
--- Unknown ---
The child
Is on fire
--- Unknown ---
He's hot
As the sun
--- Unknown ---
He'll burn
Like a pyre
--- Unknown ---
'Til freedom
Is won! Hope
--- Unknown ---
Oh
Bobby!
--- Unknown ---
No,
Bobby!
--- Unknown ---
Oh
Bobby!
--- Unknown ---
No,
Bobby!
--- Unknown ---
The Poor
Cladwell's
Nuts
With no if's, and's
Or but's!
Yes, he's a real
Live loon!
A freaking
Looney tune!
And when he's
Done with us
He'll put us on a
Bus
Bound for that
Unknown place
That we all
All dread to face! Cladwell and UGC Staff
--- Unknown ---
You
Are wrong
Mr. Strong!
--- Unknown ---
You
Are wrong
Mr. Strong!
--- Unknown ---
Very
Wrong
Mr. Strong!
--- Unknown ---
You
Are wrong
Mr. Strong!

All but Bobby
You'll/We'll get
Urinetown!

Urinetown!

Off you'll/we'll go to
Urinetown!

Hope
So what'll it be, Bobby?
--- Unknown ---
Bobby
Looks like we're in a real bad spot, doesn't it. I suppose we should leave.
--- Unknown ---
Hope
Oh, Bobby, they'll never let you leave now.
--- Unknown ---
Bobby
Not without you they won't. Which is why you're coming with us.
--- Unknown ---
Hope
But how can I come with you and not fight against my father,
unless...unless...oh dear God, Bobby, no!

Mr. Strong!
Our resources as as
Fragile as a
Newborn baby's skull!
With your
Actions you would
Leave a lifeless hull!
A lifeless hull
Mr. Strong!
You're very dull
Mr. Strong!
Disperse your throng

And end your song

Lockstock
Well, that's it for Act One.
As you can see, the rebel poor are making
their get-away with Hope as their hostage
The rest of us have been
thrown into confusion because -
well, because we're all moving
so damned slowly. So we don't
get to catch them. Not yet.
Enjoy intermission,
and see you -
shortly!
