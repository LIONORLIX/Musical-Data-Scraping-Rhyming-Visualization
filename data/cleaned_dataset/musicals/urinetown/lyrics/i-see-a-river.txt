------ I See A River ------
--- Unknown ---
Hope
I see a river flowing for freedom
I see a river just in view
I see a river flowing for freedom
I see a river straight and true
--- Unknown ---
Come to the river flowing for justice
Come to the river rendezvous
Come to the river flowing for justice
All for the people, me and you

Well, as you guessed, Hope took over her father's business, instituting
a series of reforms which opened the public bathrooms to all the people,
to pee for free whenever they liked, as much as they liked, for as long
as they liked, with whomever they liked. The UGC was renamed, The Bobby
Strong Memorial Toilet Authority and was operated as a public trust for
the benefit of the people.

Hope and Little Becky Two Shoes
All in the family, push toward the river
Shove toward the river, why don't you?
--- Unknown ---
All
Step in the river, wade in the river
Soak in the river through and through
Once in the river, you are the river
Friends on the shorelines, jump in too

Lockstock
Of course, it wasn't long before the water turned silty, brackish and
then disappeared altogether. As cruel as Caldwell B. Cladwell was, his
measures effectively regulated water consumption, sparing the town the
same fate as the phantom Urinetown. Hope chose to ignore the warning
signs, however, preferring to bask in the people's love for as long as
it lasted.

Little Sally
What kind of musical is this?! The good guys finally take over and then
everything starts falling apart.
--- Unknown ---
Lockstock
Like I said, Little Sally. This isn't a happy musical.
--- Unknown ---
Little Sally
But the music's so happy!
--- Unknown ---
Lockstock
Yes, Little Sally. Yes it is.

Josephine
Such a fever. If only I had a cool, tall glass of water, maybe I'd have
a fighting chance.
--- Unknown ---
Hope
But don't you see, Mrs. Strong? The glass of water's inside you, it
always has been.
--- Unknown ---
Josephine
It has?
--- Unknown ---
Hope
Of course it has. Don't you know what you are?
--- Unknown ---
Josephine
A river?
--- Unknown ---
Hope
That's right. We all are.
--- Unknown ---
You are the river, I am the river
He is the river, she is too
--- Unknown ---
Hope and Josephine
All are the river flowing for freedom
Flowing for justice, let's review
--- Unknown ---
All
We see a river flowing for freedom
We see a river just in view
You see a river flowing for freedom
You see a river straight and true

Little Sally
I don't think too many people are going to come see this musical,
Officer Lockstock.
--- Unknown ---
Lockstock
Why do you say that, Little Sally? Don't you think people want to be
told that their way of life is unsustainable?
--- Unknown ---
Little Sally
That, and the title's awful.
--- Unknown ---
Lockstock
I suppose you're right, Little Sally. I do suppose you're right.
--- Unknown ---
Little Sally
Can't we do a happy musical next time?
--- Unknown ---
Lockstock
If there is a next time I'm sure we can. Well, that's our story. Hope
eventually joined her father in a manner not quite so gentle. As for the
people of this town? They did as best they could. But they were prepared
for the world they inherited, weaned as they were on the legend born of
their founding father's scare tactics. For when the water dried up, they
recognized their town for the first time for what it really was. What it
was always waiting to be.

All
This is Urinetown!
Always it's been Urinetown!
This place, it's called Urinetown!

Hail Malthus!

Hail Malthus!

Thank you. And goodnight.
