Whaddaya think they talk about in those quorums they got up there - how
good we are?! So listen up, now! Any second those cops are gonna bust in
here and bust us up like a bunch of overripe canteloupes! So I say as
long as our juice has gotta spill - all over this floor, here - her
juice has gotta spill, to! Cladwell juice! Then we'll see who's better
than who.
--- Unknown ---
Look at here there
All bound up, gagged and tied
With her head full of hair
And her heart full of pride!
--- Unknown ---
Well, boys, I've had enough
Of each arrogant curl!
Bing! Bang! Boom! Let's get tough
Playin' rough -
Snuff that girl!
--- Unknown ---
Little Sally
Snuff that girl? But killing people is wrong!
--- Unknown ---
Little Becky Two Shoes
Then why does it feel so right?
--- Unknown ---
Look at us here
In a hole, on the lam
With our hearts full of fear -
What a rip! What a sham!
You know, cops will be here
Bustin' heads mighty quick!
--- Unknown ---
Hot Blades Harry
But we'll beat them to the bunch
When we snuff out that chick!
--- Unknown ---
Little Becky Two Shoes
We tried doin' what we should!

Hot Blades Barry
Wasn't glad!

Little Beck Two Shoes
Then we learned that feelin' good
--- Unknown ---
Hot Blades Harry
Mean's doin' bad!
--- Unknown ---
Both
Nuts, they fall close
So they say, to the tree
Looky here, here's an a-
Corn from Cladwell I see
I say, she is the nut
and of course, we're the squirrel!
She is what we saved for winter
So let's snuff that girl!

That's as good as it gets!

Eat the oyster and the pearl
--- Unknown ---
And let's get this party jumpin'!
Really get it pumpin'!
Get this party jumpin'
Yeah, let's snuff that -
