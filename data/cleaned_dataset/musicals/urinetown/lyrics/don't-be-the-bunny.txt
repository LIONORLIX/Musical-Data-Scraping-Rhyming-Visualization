------ Don't Be The Bunny ------

A little bunny in the meadow
Is nibbling grass without a care
He's so delightful as he hops for you
You say, Hi, bunny
And he stops for you
You pull your trigger
And he drops for you
Goodbye, bunny-boo
Hello, rabbit stew!
--- Unknown ---
Get me, boys?
--- Unknown ---
Staff
You tell 'em, boss!
--- Unknown ---
Cladwell
Don't be the bunny
Don't be the stew
Don't be the dinner
You have better things to do
That's why it's funny
So take your cue
Don't be the bunny
Don't be the bunny

Hope
But Daddy, we're talking about people, not animals.
--- Unknown ---
Cladwell
People are animals, Hope dear.
--- Unknown ---
Hope
Animals with huge incisors and big floppy feet?
--- Unknown ---
Cladwell
Look closely, you'll see them. I do. I see them...everywhere.

A little bunny at a toll booth
He needs a measly fifty cents
Our little bunny didn't plan ahead
Poor bunny simply hasn't got the bread
He begs for mercy, but gets jail instead
Hasenpfeffer's in the air
As the bunny gets the chair!
--- Unknown ---
See the moral, people?
--- Unknown ---
Staff
Clear as day, boss!
--- Unknown ---
Cladwell
Don't be the bunny
Don't be the dope
Don't be the loser
You're much better than that, Hope!
You're born to pow'r
You're in the money!
Advice to you

Cladwell
You heard me.

Hope
But Daddy, bunnies don't drive cars.
--- Unknown ---
Cladwell
Oh, don't they?!
--- Unknown ---
Hope
No, actually, I don't think they do.

Cladwell
Live long enough, Hope dear, you see...many things.

Hope
Even a daughter doubting her father?

A little bunny in a shoe box
He thinks he's found a brand new home
So snug and cozy on your closet floor
Now what's that bunny in my closet for?
With a mallet and some clippers
You find out: new bunny slippers!
--- Unknown ---
Grasp the message, staff?
--- Unknown ---
Staff
Right behind you, boss!
--- Unknown ---
Cladwell and Staff
Don't be the bunny
Don't be the shoe
You don't get stepped on -
--- Unknown ---
Cladwell
No, the one who steps is you!
--- Unknown ---
Cladwell and Staff
You're stepping up
To where it's sunny
Step on the poor!
Don't be the bunny!
Don't be the bunny!
