Cladwell
I saw gray skies, foreboding and cold!
I saw gray skies and made them rain gold!
Now those skies aren't so bleak to behold!
They're still gray
But they pay
For your sal'ries tenfold!
--- Unknown ---
I took this town that formerly stank
I took this town and made it smell swank!
I made flushing mean flush at the bank!
I'm the man
With the plan
And so who should you thank?
--- Unknown ---
McQueen
Whom?
--- Unknown ---
Chorus
Mister Cladwell
We're so thankful
For that bank full of dough!
You're a toreador
And it's cash that you gore!
Could we hope for much more?
We really doubt it!
--- Unknown ---
Cladwell
You may be right there!
--- Unknown ---
Chorus
Mister Cladwell
You've got riches
Which is just what we need!
--- Unknown ---
We say
Hail to you, the Duke of the ducats!
--- Unknown ---
Cladwell
I can bring in bucks by the buckets!
--- Unknown ---
Chorus
You're the master
You're making money!
--- Unknown ---
Cladwell
Faster still than bees making honey!
--- Unknown ---
Chorus
You're Mister Cladwell!

Hope
Gosh Daddy, I never realized large, monopolizing corporations could be
such a force for good in the world.
--- Unknown ---
Cladwell
Few do.
--- Unknown ---
McQueen
All those coins
That we take from the throng
End up here
Where those coins all belong
Lots of coins
Make our company strong!
--- Unknown ---
Cladwell
Charging fees
As we please
Is our right - it's not wrong!
--- Unknown ---
McQueen
We're not greedy as some make us seem
We need funds for our big research team
--- Unknown ---
Dr. Billeaux
Men in labcoats and test tubes with steam!
--- Unknown ---
Cladwell and McQueen
What it shows
No one knows
But, hey, still we can dream!
--- Unknown ---
McQueen
Of!
--- Unknown ---
Chorus
Mister Cladwell
Finding answers
Curing cancers
Of doubt!
--- Unknown ---
Your ambitions are high
But you're
Humble as pie!
What a wonderful guy!
We simply love you!

Hope
Da-

Da, Da
Da, Da, Daddy
That's my Dad!
Daddy
Daddy
That's my Daddy
And I simply
Love you!

Cladwell
You're making me blush now!
--- Unknown ---
Chorus
Mister Cladwell
You're so godly!
Oddly perfect and right!
--- Unknown ---
Men
You are continental, yet
Unpretentious!
--- Unknown ---
Women
Fancy-free, yet so conscientious!
--- Unknown ---
Men
Wise but trendy, tough as a mountain!
--- Unknown ---
Chorus
Goodness flows from you like a fountain!
You're mister, you're Mister -

Cladwell
Cladwell!
