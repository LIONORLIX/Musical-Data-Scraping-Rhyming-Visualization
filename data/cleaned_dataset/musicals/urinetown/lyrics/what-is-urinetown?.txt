Little Becky Two Shoes
What is Urinetown?
Urinetown's the end!
Swift and brutal punishment
No need now to pretend!

Hot Blades Harry
The trap door's sprung
And then you're hung
And when they cut you down
They'll box you up and ship you out
And call it Urinetown!
--- Unknown ---
The Poor
They'll box you up and ship you out
And call it Urinetown!
Town!
Town!
Town!
Town!
--- Unknown ---
Dance?
No!
Never do they dance!
Those people down in Urinetown
They never get the chance!
Dancing, forget it!
Never, nada, nope!
Unless it's at the bottom of a rope!

People hear lots of things about Urinetown, of course, and that's just
the way we like it. For example, a little boy once asked me, Is
Urinetown actually a nice place to live? Gingerbread houses along
golden, frothy canals? Like Venice, only different? I didn't say yes. I
didn't say no, either.

What is Urinetown?
Urinetown's a tool
An instrument of power
To enforce my iron rule
So send your troops
To all the stoops
And let them understand
If Hope is not returned
It's Urinetown for all the land!
--- Unknown ---
The Poor
If Hope is not returned
It's Urinetown for all the land!
Land!
Land!
Land!
Land!

Dance?
Dance?
Do they think I'll dance?
Those people with my daughter
Want to make me change my stance
Stance-dance, forget it!
Never, nada, nein!
I'll teach them not to
Take from me what's mine!

Bobby
What is Urinetown?
Urinetown's a lie
A means to keep the poor in check
Until the day they die!
I did not shirk their dirty work
But things are different now
We'll fight for right
With all our might
Until we win somehow!
--- Unknown ---
Bobby and Josephine
We'll fight for might
With all our might
Until we win somehow!
How!
How!
How!
How!

Dance!
Dance!
Listen to it dance!
My heart is like a stallion
Racing through a great expanse
Canyons of freedom
That's where it will waltz
Performing coronary somersaults!
--- Unknown ---
Little Sally
What is Urinetown?
Urinetown is here!
It's the town wherever
People learn to live in fear
So look around, you've finally found
The place you asked about
For Urinetown is your town
If you're hopeless down and out!
--- Unknown ---
All
For Urinetown is your town
If you're hopeless, down and out!

For Urinetown is your town
If you're hopeless, down and out!

All
Out!
Out!
Out!
Out!
