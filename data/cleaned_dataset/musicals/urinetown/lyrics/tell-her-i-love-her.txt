------ Tell Her I Love Her ------
--- Unknown ---
Little Sally
Tell her I love her
Tell her I'll always be with her
And I will see her in a better place
Where hope is always new
--- Unknown ---
Ours was a short time
Ours was a love that never bloomed
Yet in that love there lives
A brand new hope
It's calling out to you
--- Unknown ---
Its call is soft and gentle
Tame and fine
It's docile and benign
--- Unknown ---
Bobby
A pickle in the brine
What did I say? That isn't what I meant
I've lost my sense of scent
I fear my life is spent
--- Unknown ---
Bobby and Little Sally
No one is innocent
--- Unknown ---
Little Sally
No one.
--- Unknown ---
Soupy Sue
No one is innocent? What did he mean by that?
--- Unknown ---
Little Sally
I don't know, he started fading in and out after awhile. It was a
miracle he was alive at all, the fall was so horrible.
--- Unknown ---
Tiny Tom
Was he talking about me? How can he say I'm not innocent? Not innocent
of what?
--- Unknown ---
Little Sally
Wait! Wait, please. There's more. He said...
--- Unknown ---
Tell all the people
Tell them the time is always now
Tell them to fight for
What they know is right
--- Unknown ---
Bobby
I've lost my sense of sight
And yet I see them
I see them standing hand in hand
--- Unknown ---
Bobby and Little Sally
I see them standing hand in hand
and cheek to cheek and gland to gland
There still is hope, I see it, in this land
--- Unknown ---
Little Sally
If only -

Josephine
Yes?
--- Unknown ---
Bobby and Little Sally
If only - !
--- Unknown ---
All
Yes?!
