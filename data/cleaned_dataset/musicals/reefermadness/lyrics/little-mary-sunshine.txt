------ Little Mary Sunshine ------
--- Ralph ---
Little Mary Sunshine with her hem cut so low
Little Mary Sunshine with her ducks in a row
Little Mary Sunshine needs a change in her life
Little Mary Sunshine needs a man
--- Unknown ---
Now come on, Mary Sunshine
It's time that you learned to be bad!
You make a charming armful
So snuggle up, my buttercup, 'cuz you been had
--- Unknown ---
Oh, smoke it, Mary Sunshine
Dissolve in the sweet burning glow
Come lose yourself in pleasure
When the bambalacha's gotcha you'll forget the word No
--- Unknown ---
Jimmy's a rube, provincial and dull
Don't be tricked, he's strictly quadrilateral!
--- Mary ---
Jimmy's a boy, I'm ready for men
Let's go up and down and up and down and down again!
I feel a little naughty!
--- Ralph ---
Baby, I'll help you relax!
--- Mary ---
I'll tie you up with phone cord
We'll play with whips and nipple clips and candle wax!
--- Ralph ---
Now hold on, Mary Sunshine
Let's not get carried away!
--- Mary ---
Just call me Mary Wanna
And Mary's got some scary little games to play!
I'll lather you up and give you a shave
A paddling while straddling my little slave!
Down on your knees! It's pointless to fight!
Save your strength, it's gonna be a lengthy night!
--- Ralph, Mary ---
Goodbye to Mary Sunshine!
Reefer has blown out her mind!
She's now a hot-hay hussy!
--- Mary ---
Don't you run! I'm not done!
Can't you tell we've just begun?!
What's your rush? You're not having fun?!
--- Ralph ---
No, I'm really not!
--- Both ---
Mary, Mary Sunshine
