------ Tell 'Em the Truth ------
--- Mae ---
The tragic victim of drug abuse
Has now been spared for a higher use
--- Jimmy ---
They were ready to cook my goose
But God had other plans
--- FDR ---
He works in mysterious ways, Jimmy.
--- Jimmy ---
I feel like something inside has stirred
At long, long last may the truth be heard
--- FDR ---
Go forth, Jimmy, and spread the word
--- FDR, Jimmy ---
From sea to shining sea
--- Mae ---
You have been set free
--- Jimmy ---
Free to tell
--- FDR, Jimmy, Mae ---
The truth about the wisdom we have learned...
--- All ---
Gonna tell 'em the truth, truth, truth
Ev'rybody gotta know, oh, oh
All about the demon weed
How it grows from a demon seed
--- FDR ---
Indeed!
--- Jimmy ---
That pungent smoke will rot your brain
Till you're incurably insane
Trust me to tell them the...
--- All ---
Gonna tell 'em the truth, truth, truth
Ev'rybody gotta know, oh, oh
With voices raised in song
We're banishing the bong!
--- FDR ---
So long!
--- All ---
Our children teeter on the brink
We need to teach them what to think
Trust us to tell them the truth
--- Unknown ---
We've got to capture the nation's ear
Spread the word 'cross the hemisphere
But there are only four people here
--- Jimmy ---
And one of us is lame!
--- FDR ---
Not to worry, Jimmy!
We'll use the papers of Mr. Hearst
Flood the airwaves until they burst
With catchy slogans we've all rehearsed
--- All ---
And iconography!
--- Uncle Sam ---
It's Uncle Sam...
--- George Washington ---
George Washington...
--- Statue of Liberty ---
And Lady Liberty!
--- All ---
Gonna tell 'em the truth, truth, truth
Ev'rybody gotta know, oh, oh
--- Uncle Sam, George W., Liberty ---
Just who to demonize
What politics to despise
--- FDR ---
Get wise!
--- All ---
We're taking down the fingerprints of
Jazz musicians and immigrants
Trust us to tell you (Gonna tell 'em)
The truth, truth, truth
Ev'rybody gotta know, oh, oh
The A-B-C's of spin
And turning your neighbors in
--- FDR ---
Or kin!
--- All ---
It's all comes down to apple pie
--- George Washington ---
George Washington would never lie
--- All ---
Trust us to tell you (Gonna tell 'em)
The truth, truth, truth
Ev'rybody gotta know, oh, oh
Let ev'ry sir an ma'am
Obey their Uncle Sam
--- FDR ---
Hot damn!
--- All ---
That famous finger's set to point:
--- Uncle Sam ---
I want you to drop that joint!
--- Unknown ---
(The following is sung in tandem)
--- All ---
Trust us to tell you (Gonna tell 'em)
The truth, truth, truth
Truth, truth, truth, etc.
Trust us to tell 'em the truth!
--- Statue of Liberty ---
Give me your tired
Give me your poor
Give me your huddled masses
Yearning to breathe free
of reefer smoke!
Freedom! Freedom!
Freedom!
--- Lecturer ---
It's time for parents to take a stand
For the preservation of our sweet land
--- All ---
Till the things that scare us are burned or banned
Or smashed to smithereens!
And once the reefer has been destroyed
We'll start on Darwin and Sigmund Freud
And sex depicted on celluloid
And communists and queens
When danger's near, exploit their fear
