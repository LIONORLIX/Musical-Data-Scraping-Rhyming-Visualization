------ The Stuff ------
--- Mae ---
I ought to leave him, but something makes me stay
It's the stuff
I'd try to kill him, but my guy gives me love
And the stuff!
Sometimes he's rough
He throws me down the stairs, but deep inside he cares
He buys me lingerie, and the stuff!
--- Unknown ---
I was a student, good grades and so naive
'Til the stuff
A handsome stranger, some empty promises
Lotsa stuff!
But I don't get hooked
I'm not addicted, no
I just enjoy the glow
I like to have my fun
No harm to anyone
Though the fun sometimes escapes me
when Jack gets stoned and rapes me...
