------ Down at the Ol' Five and Dime ------
--- All ---
After school is let out we just like to get out
To the place where jitterbug is always in style
Satchmo is a-singin', Dorsey is a-swingin'
A syncopated wonderland that brings on a smile
Come and stretch your dance abilities
Nobody is feelin' ill at ease
When your toes are tappin' anything can happen
Down at the ol' Five and Dime!
--- Unknown ---
Dancin'! Dancin'!
Razmatazz that always has you sashayin'
Swayin'
Buy your gal some jujubees
She'll be swoonin', spoonin'
Down at the ol' Five and Dime!
--- Mr. Poppy ---
Hey! My name is Mr. Poppy
In my little shop, we make the finest cherry fizz in all of the land
Service with a smile, makin' quite a pile
Even have a little left to pay for a band
--- Unknown ---
(Short musical break)
--- All ---
You can buy yourself a pack of smokes
--- Mr. Poppy ---
Laugh at Mr. Poppy's knock knock jokes
--- All ---
Ho! Gotta take the gang out to the local hangout
Where Benny Goodman is king!
--- Unknown ---
(dialogue, dance break)
--- Unknown ---
Dancin'! Dancin'!
--- Mr. Poppy ---
Then enjoy some funny books
--- All ---
We get frisky, risky
--- Mr. Poppy ---
Cool off with a malted milk
--- All ---
We're all boppin', come drop in
Down at the ol' Five and Dime!
--- Mr. Poppy ---
Sometimes men would come to call
who stank of sin and Barbasol
They'd ask kids if they felt at all like
having themselves a few kicks!
--- Unknown ---
(dialogue, swing music break)
--- All ---
Feel the crazy rhythm in your feet
Everybody keep in reet petite
Blazing bright as neon, maybe we could be on
Major Bowes' amateur hour!
--- Unknown ---
(dialogue)
--- Unknown ---
Dancin'! Dancin'!
Charleston till our tootsies ache
We'll be slidin', glidin'
Rompin' to the Savoy Stomp
We're rug cuttin', struttin'
Then as a coda, we drink ice cream soda
