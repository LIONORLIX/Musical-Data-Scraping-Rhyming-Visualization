------ Romeo & Juliet ------
--- Jimmy ---
I need words to tell you 'bout my pounding heart
Four dollar words thaht make a guy sound smart
Oh, I guess that's why they invented Shakespeare!
His articulations of a lover's palpitations are so keen!
--- Unknown ---
My bounty is as boundless as the sea!
My love as deep the more I give to thee!
--- Mary ---
Oh, you sound so dreamy when you talk like Shakespeare!
--- Both ---
A big vocabulary should be customary when you fall in love!
--- Jimmy ---
La la la la la la, you're a snowy dove!
--- Mary ---
La la la, prodigious birth of love!
--- Both ---
La la la la la, hip hooray for Shakespeare!
Sure as I am breathing, you sure make Elizabethan language fun!
We are just like Romeo and Juliet
We're happy, young and bubbling with love!
--- Jimmy ---
I can't wait to read the ending!
--- Mary ---
I can't either! But I'm sure it turns out real swell
I bet Romeo marries his Juliet
--- Jimmy ---
They have a baby
--- Mary ---
And make lots of friends!
--- Both ---
That's prob'ly the way the play ends!
--- Mary ---
You doth teach the torches how to burn real bright
--- Jimmy ---
Hanging like a jewel upon the cheek of night!
--- Both ---
Hark! What light through yonder window breaks here
We'll be future spouses
Put a plague on both our houses if we're wrong!
