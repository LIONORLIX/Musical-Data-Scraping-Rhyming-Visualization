------ Murder ------
--- Jimmy ---
Remember me, Ralph? I'm about to fry
--- Ralph ---
Shut up!
--- Jimmy ---
While you and your friends stand idly by
My life is a ticking bomb
I'm gonna miss my senior prom!
You murdered me, Ralph!
--- Ralph ---
Shut up!
--- Jimmy ---
Murdered me!
--- Ralph ---
Murdered you!
--- Jimmy ---
Murdered you!
--- Ralph ---
Murdered him!
--- Sally ---
Everything okay, Ralph?
--- Ralph ---
Don't you see the kid? He's haunting me!
--- Mae ---
Maybe you better cool off on the muggles there.
--- Ralph ---
I'm just a little hungry, that's all.
--- Mary ---
Remember me, Ralph?
I've been sent to Hell
A pubescent edition of Jezebel
It hurts a lot to bend
But at least I've made a friend
--- Goat Man ---
Bah-bah-bah-bah-bah!
--- Mary ---
Murdered me!
--- Ralph ---
Murdered you?
--- Jimmy ---
Murdered me!
--- Ralph ---
Murdered them!
--- Jack ---
What's eating him?
--- Sally ---
I think he's had one too many giggle sticks.
--- Ralph ---
Man, I'm starvin'. We got any eats?
--- Jack ---
Check the icebox, hotshot.
--- Ralph ---
The icebox. That's good. That's good.
--- Zombies ---
Open the gate and abandon hope
With the ghosts of the kids that got hooked on dope
--- Ralph ---
Way down where it's hot
They are saving us a spot
--- Rats (puppets popping up from a trap door) ---
You murdered them, Ralph!
--- All ---
Murdered 'em! Murdered 'em!
Murdered 'em! Murdered 'em!
--- Ralph ---
Fellas, wait! Ya got any cheese, or what?
--- Sally ---
He's losing it, Jack
--- Jack ---
Gee, you don't suppose
--- Mae ---
He's liable to crack and spill all he knows
--- Mae, Sally ---
He's really acting weird
--- Jack ---
Perhaps it's time he disappeared
He'd never be missed! I could
--- Zombies, Jack ---
Murder him! Murder him!
Murder him! Murder him!
--- Mae ---
Jack, no! You fire that gun, you'll have the cops right back here...
--- Jack ---
We'll play it your way...for now.
--- Sally ---
Ow! He bit me!
--- Ralph ---
Jack? My tummy's getting rumbly! Feed me! Feed me!
--- Sally ---
Leggo my arm! Jack, make him stop -- he's giving me the creepin' heebie-jeebies!
--- Jack ---
C'mon, Mae. We'll go and get Ralph a bite.
--- Mae ---
Yeah, he's liable to wake the whole building with that racket.
--- Jack ---
You. Stay here. Keep him piped down.
--- Sally ---
Jack? I don't like the way he's lookin' at me. Shake a leg with that grub.
--- Ralph ---
Leg...grub...
--- Mae ---
Ralph, we have take-away from Dim-Foo's... Ralph? Sally? Where'd they go?
--- Jack ---
They best not have skipped town.
--- Mae ---
Sally? Ralph?
--- Ralph ---
I found me a snack, it was nice and fresh
--- Mae, Jack ---
The weed made him hungry for human flesh
--- Jack ---
Step away, you mug
'Cuz that's a brand new Persian rug
--- Mae ---
He's not gonna stop!
--- All ---
Murder him! Murder him!
Murder him! Murder him!
--- Mae ---
Oh God, oh God, oh God...
--- Jack ---
Mae! Don't get queer on me now.
--- Zombies ---
Open the gate and abandon hope
With the ghosts of the kids that got hooked on dope
--- Mae ---
Now I see them, Jack!
And they all want their childhoods back!
We murdered them, Jack!
--- All ---
Murdered them! Murdered them!
Murdered them! Murdered them!
--- Zombies ---
Open the gate and abandon hope
--- Jack ---
Pull it together
Don't flip your skirt
--- Zombies ---
With the ghosts of the kids that got hooked on dope
--- Unknown ---
(The last lines are all sung in tandem)
--- Jack ---
Don't flip your skirt
You do the things you gotta do
In this dog eat dog eat dog world
Survival of the fittest
So you murder 'em
Before they murder you
The winner is the last one left alive!
Alive!
--- Mae ---
Now I see them, Jack
And they all want their childhoods back!
We murdered them, Jack!
--- Mae, Zombies ---
Murdered 'em! Murdered 'em!
Murdered murdered
Murdered murdered
Murdered murdered
Murdered murdered
Murdered murdered
Murdered
Murdered 'em!
