------ The Promise ------

Dr. Manette
There's something in his face.
There's something i don't trust.
A memory i can't place from long ago.
And yet he's been so kind.
To doubt him is unjust.
For lucie's sake i'll put it from my mind...
I must.

Charles darnay
There are no words i know
To say the way i feel.
Words aren't enough to show you i'm sincere.
I've held this in as long as i could stand.
--- Unknown ---
Dr. Manette
Because of me?
--- Unknown ---
Charles darnay
Out of respect.
--- Unknown ---
Dr. Manette
I understand.
--- Unknown ---
Charles darnay
Lucie haunts my heart.
Haunts my thoughts, my prayers, my dreams, my nights, my days...
--- Unknown ---
Dr. Manette
I feared this all along.
--- Unknown ---
Charles darnay
She is everywhere that i turn...
--- Unknown ---
Dr. Manette
What can i do?
I said i'd step aside one day.
--- Unknown ---
Charles darnay
I love her
You share a special love
I swear by god above
I'd never take her love from you...
I only hope to share
In what's already there.
To love you both
And to be true.
--- Unknown ---
Dr. Manette
Does lucie know?
--- Unknown ---
Charles darnay
I've never told her so.
Without your blessing i've no hope...
--- Unknown ---
Dr. Manette
It's up to me to choose
But either way i lose
If she should love him,
I must let her go.
It seems like yesterday
I stood there in his place
When someone meant the world to me...
--- Unknown ---
Charles darnay
She is my world....
--- Unknown ---
Dr. Manette
And someone gave the world to me.
--- Unknown ---
Charles darnay
Give the world to me.
--- Unknown ---
Dr. Manette
If lucie feels the same
You have my blessing sir.
Nothing means more to me than her.
--- Unknown ---
Charles darnay you won't regret this trust.
And to repay your faith.
There is a secret you must learn...
Darnay is not my name.
--- Unknown ---
Dr. Manette
Don't tell me anymore.
--- Unknown ---
Charles darnay
But doctor please you ought to know.
--- Unknown ---
Dr. Manette
If things should go your way
Tell me your wedding day.
For now, be silent,
Please just go.
At least i got her back
If for a little while.
At least i had a little while.
