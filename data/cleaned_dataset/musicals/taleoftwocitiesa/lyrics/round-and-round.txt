Drinkers/Whores
Here and there without a care,
Filling, spilling everywhere,
Drinking in the sights.
Clapping for a waiter here.
Lapping up a keg of beer,
Lazy days and hazier nights
If floods of rain have left you frowning
There's a better way we know of drowning. Our sorrows
Never seem to matter,
But we must confess
Happiness to excess is tough on the bladder.

Passersby
Christmas eve and what a sight!
Just like any other night.
Just like any day.

Drinkers/Whores
All the righteous pass and frown.
If they see us kneeling down
You can bet it won't be to pray.

Bless this fine night.
Bless this night he was born.
This sublime night.
Bless this night he was born.

Drinkers/Whores
Christmas
With your righteous
And your pious
And your boring.
Keep your christmas
With your good will
And your good cheer.
Where's your good cheer
All the rest of the year?
Here it's round and round and round you go.
Have another round to go.
Have another splash.
Round and round and round you go.
Straight into the ground you go
With a pounding crash.
If it seems the wicked just keep winning
What else can we do but just keep sinning? Spinning
Round and round and round you go
And does anybody know where it all will end, friend?
Never saying when,
Here we go again.
Round and round and down you go
Again!
