Must be of no earthly good or else he wouldn't be here!
While he was aboard ship

Was noticed by many through his shameless exhibition.

Barsad
On deck i was strolling
I noticed this frenchman
And he didn't seem like any ordinary henchman
He looked very honest
But i would discover
That he was a book where you must look inside the cover
He laid down his top coat
And out of his pocket
Came tumbling papers which have sent him to the docket
I thought i'd be helpful
I bent and retrieved them
And my eyes beheld such a sight
I thought the night deceived them
