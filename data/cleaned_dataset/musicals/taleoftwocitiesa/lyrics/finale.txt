Seamstress
You are not afraid.
All the others just pretend.
It's as if you would embrace
The very end.
You're an angel, sir.
You were sent to me by god.
--- Unknown ---
Carton
And perhaps it's you that god has sent to me.

Seamstress
When i hold your hand; all my fears are in the past.
But when i let go do you promise they'll be fast?
--- Unknown ---
Carton
Like a lightning flash
All your suffering will cease
--- Unknown ---
Seamstress
Will i find you again?
--- Unknown ---
Carton
There can be no farewells.
We will meet where the weary find peace
--- Unknown ---
Carton
I can't recall a sky so clear
All the heavens seem an inch away and not unfriendly afterall
--- Unknown ---
All
If life was never quite this sweet i can't recall
--- Unknown ---
Carton
It is a far far better thing i do than i have ever done
It is a far better rest i go to than i have ever known
