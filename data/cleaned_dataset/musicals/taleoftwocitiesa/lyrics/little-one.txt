Little one
Ease your heart
Close your eyes
And let dreams take you far
Far away from the storm
To a summer day, warm and fair
Hardly a care finds you, little one.

Defarge
Little one ease your heart
Close your eyes
And let dreams take you far far away
From the screams
And the smell of blood in the air
Hardly a care finds you little one

Little one
Mind your way
Don't let people without hearts step on you
And toss you away. If you'll wait and you'll pray
Papa will save you and hide you away.
Little one
Heed my voice
Little one
Mind your way
Just you wait
--- Unknown ---
Defarge
Just you wait.
