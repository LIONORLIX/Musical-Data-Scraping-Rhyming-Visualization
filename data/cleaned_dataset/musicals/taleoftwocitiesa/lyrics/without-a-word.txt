------ Without a Word ------

Lucie Manette
How could you leave?
Leave without a word?
How could you do this to your own?
Go out alone to save a stranger
A distant memory that stirred
Weren't we enough?
All that you could want?
Weren't we enough to hold you home?
You made a vow to be with me
When you were never really free
But i'll be brave
And i'll be strong
You'll never know from me that you've done something wrong
And from my lips
And from my eyes
I'll give you everything i should
A loving wife's goodbyes
Yes you love me
That much i can see
Deep in your eyes behind the fear
I'm sure you know that i'm still here
No matter what you've done i'm always here
I'd follow you
I'd be selfish too
I'd gladly join you in the grave
But i must stay and play my part
Of wife and mother's broken heart
For i was once
Where she could be
Abandoned young without a home or family
And though my soul
Will die with you
Our child will not be left alone
To spend a lifetime wondering how
How we could do this to our own
You needn't fear that she'll be hurt
She'll never know just what you've cost her
How selfishly you lost
Her she'll never hear me ask the question in my heart
Tell me how could you leave leave
Without a word?
