------ I Can't Recall ------
--- Unknown ---
Sydney carton
[speaking]
What was that?
And where did all those stars come from?
Carton, you are drunk, aren't you?
--- sings ---
I can't recall a night so clear
The heavens seem an inch away
Not cold and empty like before
A night as sweet as this tonight
I can't recall
--- Unknown ---
I can't recall the taste of wine
Have i been drinking down my days
A crippled wretch content to call
If i have been that man right now
I can't recall
--- Unknown ---
I can't recall my sense of shame
Was failure borne inside my heart
Or dead the many years of waste?
Leave it there
Did i just feel it disappear because you care?
--- Unknown ---
The choice is mine
Tomorrow's at my feet
All yesterdays a haze
I pray that i will not repeat
--- Unknown ---
I can't recall a night so clear
The heavens seem an inch away
And not unfriendly after all
After all
If life was ever quite this sweet
I can't recall
