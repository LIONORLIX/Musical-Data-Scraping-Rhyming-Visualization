------ Until Tomorrow ------
--- Unknown ---
Defarge
Remember how long we've been waiting
We've been praying for this day
Until tomorrow is upon us
Will you follow me today?
Look in your hearts and find a soldier
There's no time to be afraid
Until tomorrow is upon us
Will you follow me today? We've lived a lifetime
In a country we could never call our own
For once we all must stand together or we'll surely fall alone
Look in the faces of your children and you cannot turn away
Tomorrow's dawning; can you see it?
The future's ours if we can free it!
It won't be long until tomorrow is today.
The time is upon us
We fight now or never
We're lighting a fire they'll remember forever
We go the bastille the symbol of terror
We'll swing the gates open we'll lead them to freedom we'll show them the way!
For years a wind was softly blowing
Softly building to a force
For years a storm was slowly growing now they cannot change the course
Look in your hearts and find a soldier
There's no time to be afraid
Tomorrow's dawning; can you see it?
The future's ours if we can free it!
It won't be long
It won't be long
It won't be long
Until tomorrow
Until tomorrow
Until tomorrow
Is today!
