------ More Than Survive (Reprise) ------
--- JEREMY ---
C-c-c'mon, c-c-c'mon,
Go!
Ow!
--- SQUIP ---
(Spoken) What did we say about masturbation?
--- JEREMY ---
I was just gonna...check my email...
--- SQUIP ---
You can't lie to me, Jeremy, I'm inside your brain.
Now, we're going to divise a system:
I tally every time you think about sex and that is how many push ups you do.
If this morning is an indicative sample, you'll have pecks in no time.
--- JEREMY ---
(Sung) Still not gonna be the cool guy,
But maybe not so left out.
Of all the characters at school,
I might be the one who the story's about.
Now that someone's helping me out!
--- SQUIP ---
Now get ready...
--- JEREMY/SQUIP ---
...to more...
--- JEREMY ---
Than survive!
--- COMPANY ---
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah...
--- JEREMY ---
All in all, a not to heinous day...
--- COMPANY ---
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah...
--- JEREMY ---
Walk the hall with purpose as a swagger along my way...
--- COMPANY ---
(Interluding) Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, hey! Hey!
--- JEREMY ---
Feelin' crisp and high and clean...
--- COMPANY ---
(Interluding) Nah...nah...nah...
