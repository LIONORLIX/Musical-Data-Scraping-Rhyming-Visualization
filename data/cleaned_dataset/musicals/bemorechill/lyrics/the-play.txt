------ The Play ------
--- Unknown ---
Places for scene two people!
Remember, once Puck gives you the Pansy Serum,
You have to really sell that you're transforming into a zombie.
Excellent work, Ms. Valentine.
--- Unknown ---
Excellent? But Chloe's terrible. She never remembers her-
Mr. Reyes, you can't let anyone drink from that beaker!
--- Unknown ---
Don't be silly, it's more than safe. I should know, I tried it myself.
--- Unknown ---
Up Up Down Down Left Right A
--- Unknown ---
I have to get out there!
--- Unknown ---
I can't let you do that Jeremy.
--- Unknown ---
Mr. Reyes?
--- Unknown ---
You needy, pathetic, self-centered students!
You think I wanted to teach highschool drama?
In New Jersey!
My Squip says I can go all the way to Broadway.
I just have to keep you from ruining my big night.
--- Unknown ---
You're going to Squip the whole cast.
--- Unknown ---
That's just for starters.
--- Unknown ---
That's not what I wanted!
--- Unknown ---
It's the only way to achieve what you want.
--- Unknown ---
I'll fight back.
Alcohol messes you up, right?
I'll get drunk.
--- Unknown ---
And I'll be back when you're sober.
Unless, you plan on staying wasted forever?
--- Unknown ---
You're a computer.
There has to be a way to turn you off.
--- Unknown ---
I would stop there.
You don't want to end up like Rich.
--- Unknown ---
Rich? What did he-
--- Unknown ---
I need Moutain Dew Red!
--- Unknown ---
That's it!
Green Moutain Dew activates you, Red shuts you off!
--- Unknown ---
Why do you think we had it discontinued?
To get rid of me now, you'd need a time machine to the 1990s.
--- Unknown ---
Or a friend who's so old school he buys 90s soft drinks from the back room at Spencer's Gifts!
--- Unknown ---
Too bad you don't have one of those anymore.
--- Unknown ---
Michael! Call Michael!
--- Unknown ---
I'm going to improve your life, Jeremy.
If I have to take over the entire student body to do it.
--- Unknown ---
Michael makes an entrance!
Haha
--- Unknown ---
Michael!
--- Unknown ---
I was just in the audience thinking,
This is pretty good for a school play.
Then I was like,
This is way too good for a school play!
They've all been Squiped, right?
--- Unknown ---
Wait, you came to see me in the play?
--- Unknown ---
Even brought my own refreshments!
--- Unknown ---
Is that?
--- Unknown ---
Mountain Dew Red!
Told you I did my research.
Hey! Jake!
This is gonna sound weird,
But if I hold down Jeremy, will you make him drink this Mountain Dew Red?
--- Unknown ---
Actually, that doesn't sound weird at all.
--- Unknown ---
Up Up Down Down Left Right A
--- Unknown ---
Ugh!
--- Unknown ---
Hahaha
--- Unknown ---
I was already pretty boss before,
Now I'm totally boss, and then some more
I'm living the upgra-a-a-a-a-ade
--- Unknown ---
There you are, Jeremy.
La la la la la, La la la la la, La la la la la la la la
--- Unknown ---
I just want you to know,
I'm not mad that you broke my heart and slept with my best friend.
--- Unknown ---
And I'm not mad you dated my best friend and wouldn't sleep with me.
--- Unknown ---
He didn't sleep with you?
--- Unknown ---
No.
--- Unknown ---
He didn't sleep with me!
--- Unknown ---
No!
--- Unknown ---
Oh my god!
Why was I so jealous of you?
--- Unknown ---
You were jealous of me?
That's the nicest thing you've ever said to me!
--- Unknown ---
Sisters forever!
Jinx.
--- Unknown ---
Ugh.
--- Unknown ---
Michael, the bottle!
There's still a few drops left!
--- Unknown ---
How am I supposed to get passed them?
--- Unknown ---
Apocalypse of the Damned!
Level nine!
--- Unknown ---
The Cafetorium.
--- Unknown ---
Got it!
--- Unknown ---
Find the bad guy, push him aside
Then move on forward with your friend at your side
It's a two player game, so when they make an attack
You know you got a brother gonna have your back
Then you stay on track and ah!
Remain on course
And if they give you a smack
You gotta use your force
And if you leave your brother behind, it's lame
'Cause it's an f-ed up world, but it's a two player game!
--- Unknown ---
I know what you're doing, Michael.
I know what everyone's doing!
All the time!
--- Unknown ---
I just feel so conected to you guys right now!
--- Unknown ---
You don't want to drink that, Jeremy.
--- Unknown ---
Why not?
--- Unknown ---
Because then you'll never be with her.
--- Unknown ---
You are the person I want to be with every day.
And this is something that I've been afraid to say.
--- Unknown ---
That is not Christine.
--- Unknown ---
I assure you, it is.
Only her fears and insecurities have been removed.
--- Unknown ---
You're the guy I am so kinda into (into).
The guy I am totally into.
This feeling is new.
Jeremy
I love you
--- Unknown ---
That's your cue.
--- Unknown ---
She'll do whatever I want.
--- Unknown ---
That's what I promised.
--- Unknown ---
Great. Drink this.
--- Unknown ---
Wait!
--- Unknown ---
Aah!
--- Unknown ---
Jeremy!
J-Jeremy?
J-Jere-e
Woah
