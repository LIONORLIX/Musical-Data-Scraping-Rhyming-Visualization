------ Voices in My Head ------
--- JEREMY’S DAD ---
You gotta but her a rose
Compliment her on her clothes
--- MICHAEL ---
Say you appreciate that she’s smart
--- RICH ---
No, man, you tell her that she
Excites you sexually
--- JEREMY’S DAD, MICHAEL, RICH ---
And that’s the way you get to her heart
Trust me, I know
How it’s gonna go
Listen and oh--
--- JEREMY ---
And there are voices in my ear
I guess these never disappear
I’ll let ‘em squeal
And I will deal
Then make up my own mind
Might still have voices in my head
But now they’re just the normal kind
Voices in my head
But now they’re the normal kind
--- JENNA ---
Just summon strength from within
--- BROOKE ---
Don’t get hung up on your skin
--- CHLOE ---
She probably thinks that acne is hot
--- JAKE ---
I’ll throw you a rope, home slice
If you need some dope advice
--- JENNA, BROOKE, CHLOE, JAKE ---
Now march on over and give her a shot
Buddy, you’ll see
It’ll go perfectly
If you listen to me me me
--- JEREMY ---
And there are voice all around
And you can never mute them out
They scream and shout
I tune them out
Then make up my own mind
Might still have voices in my head
But now they’re the normal kind
Voices in my head
But now they’re the normal kind
--- CHRISTINE (spoken) ---
I still remember how it felt.
It’s embarrassing to find out, deep down, I just want things to be easy.
\
JEREMY (spoken):
Yeah, but...who wants things to be hard?
Look, I almost destroyed the school, maybe all human civilization.
I know the last thing I deserve is another shot.
But...
--- CHRISTINE (spoken) ---
Just say what’s on your mind, Jeremy.
--- JEREMY (spoken) ---
Lunch?
Just the two of us.
--- CHRISTINE ---
And any voices in our heads?
--- JEREMY ---
There might be voices in our heads
But I swear
The voices there
Will be the regular kind
--- CHRISTINE ---
Me and the voices in my head have made up our collective mind
--- JEREMY ---
What do they say we should do?
--- CHRISTINE ---
I think that all of us want to go out with you
--- ALL ---
And there are voices in my head
So many voices in my head
And they can yell
And hurt like Hell
But I know I’ll be fine
--- JEREMY ---
I still have voices in my head
There are voices in my head
Of the voices in my head
The loudest one is mine!
--- Unknown ---
(THE SQUIP appears, weak, but still alive.)
--- THE SQUIP (spoken) ---
Jeremy...
--- JEREMY ---
Loudest one is mine!
--- THE SQUIP (spoken) ---
You can’t get rid of me that easily...
--- JEREMY ---
Loudest one is mine!
--- THE SQUIP ---
Jeeereeeemmmmmyyyyyy...
--- ALL ---
NA NA NA NA NA NA
NA NA NA NA NA NA
NA NA NA NA NA NA
--- JEREMY ---
Let’s go!
--- CHRISTINE ---
C-C-C-C’mon
C-C-C-C’mon

--- JEREMY ---
C-C-C-C’mon
C-C-C-C’mon
Let’s go
--- ALL ---
