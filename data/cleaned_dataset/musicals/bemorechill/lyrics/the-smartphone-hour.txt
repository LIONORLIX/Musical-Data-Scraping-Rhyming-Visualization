--- JENNA ---
OMG
Chlo, answer me
Whoa, wait until I tell you what I heard!
It’s too fucked to type
This shit is ripe
Call back, I’ll yell you every word
--- CHLOE ---
Jenna Rolan calling
Jenna Rolan calling
Jenna Rolan calling
Hey
--- JENNA ---
Oh my God
Oh my God
Okay
So
At the end of last night’s party
Very end of last night’s party
Did you see Rich?
--- CHLOE ---
Oh, I saw Rich.
--- JENNA ---
So, he’s behaving hazy
Like a tweakin’ junky
Flailing crazy
Like a freakin’ monkey
--- CHLOE ---
He’s gotta learn to handle his high
Shouldn’t drink so much for a small guy
--- JENNA ---
Right, but he wasn’t drunk
--- CHLOE ---
The Hell you say, Jenna?
--- JENNA ---
Yo! He wasn’t drunk
--- CHLOE ---
The Hell you say, Jenna?
--- JENNA ---
No!
Because I heard from Dustin Kropp
That rich had barely touched a drop
Which means that you can’t blame the things he did on alcohol
It’s just so terrible, I don’t want to relive it all
But do you want me to tell you?
--- CHLOE ---
Spit it out, spit it out
--- JENNA ---
You really want me to tell you?
--- CHLOE ---
Spit it out, spit it out
--- JENNA ---
I’ll tell you ‘cause you are my closest friend
--- CHLOE ---
No, I’m not
--- JENNA ---
Yeah, I know
But here’s what happened at the party’s end
Rich set a fire and he burned down the house
Oh
Rich set a fire and he burned down the house
Oh
I thought I was dreaming
Everybody was screaming
When Rich set a fire and he burned down the house
When Rich set a fire and he burned down the house
--- CHLOE ---
OMG
Brooke, answer me
Whoa, wait until I tell you what I saw
--- BROOKE ---
Ignore
--- CHLOE ---
And also
Space
And frowny face
I’m sorry that Jeremy made out with me at the party but it was totally his fault
and let’s not let boys come between us ever ever again, mmkay?
Smiley face, lipstick, kitty paw.
--- BROOKE (spoken) ---
Hey.
--- CHLOE (spoken) ---
We cool?
--- BROOKE (spoken) ---
We are?
--- CHLOE ---
Okay, so--
At the end of last night’s party
Very end of last night’s party
Did you see Rich?
--- BROOKE ---
No, I was crying
--- CHLOE ---
He’s behaving weird
And I was frightened
‘Cause I feared
His state was heightened
--- BROOKE ---
He’s gotta learn to not really smoke a lot
He shouldn’t get so high for a tiny guy
--- CHLOE, BROOKE ---
He’s gotta learn to not really smoke a lot
He shouldn’t get so high for a tiny guy
--- CHLOE ---
Right, but he wasn’t high
--- BROOKE ---
The Hell you say, Chloe?
--- CHLOE ---
Yo! He wasn’t high
--- BROOKE ---
The Hell you say, Chloe?
--- CHLOE ---
No!
Which means that you can’t blame the things he did on pot
It was so awful so I’ll talk about it a lot
Rich set a fire and he burned down the house
Oh
I thought I was dreaming
Everybody was screaming
When Rich set a fire and he burned down the house
When Rich set a fire and he burned down the house
