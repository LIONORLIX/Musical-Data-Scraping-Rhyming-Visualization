------ The Pants Song ------
--- JEREMY'S DAD ---
Jeremy is in big bad trouble right now
It’s a trouble that he can't see
And I gotta help him somehow
I don't know what he wants
But I know what he needs
--- Unknown ---
He’ll need a dad so strong
To help him not slip away
I haven't been a dad for so long
But I think I'm ready today
--- Unknown ---
Situation is grave
Now's the time to be brave
I’m gonna finally make that climb
One leg at a time
--- Unknown ---
When you love somebody you put your pants on for them
When you love somebody you take a chance just for them
Chance just for them
If the road gets muddy
Focus on the goal ‘til the rough stuff's gone
When you love somebody you put your pants on
--- Instrumental ---
--- Unknown ---
I need you
'Cause I do not have the tools
To help with what he's going through
And I know you know all the rules
--- MICHAEL ---
But I'm not what he wants
--- JEREMY’S DAD ---
But you're just what he needs
And this might be hard I know
You just suck it up and go
--- Unknown ---
When you love somebody you put your pants on for them
When you love somebody you take a stance just for them
Stance just for them
If the fight gets bloody
Just keep pushing through ‘til the pain is gone
When you love somebody you put your pants on
--- JEREMY’S DAD (Spoken) ---
I need you to reach out to him.
Jeremy won’t listen to me.
And I can’t blame him.
But somebody has to watch his back.
--- MICHAEL (Spoken) ---
If I try harder to be his friend... you have to try harder to be his dad.
There’s a Kohl’s down the street.
I don’t care what kind— jeans, khaki, leather.
You’re not leaving that store until you buy a pair.
--- JEREMY’S DAD (Spoken) ---
You drive a hard bargain, son.
--- MICHAEL ---
When you love somebody you put your pants on for them
--- JEREMY’S DAD ---
Wear those pants
--- MICHAEL ---
Somewhat reluctantly
--- BOTH ---
Still you gotta go
Oh oh
When you love somebody you put your pants on for them
Metaphorically
--- JEREMY’S DAD ---
Or sometimes actual pants
Real, literal pants
--- BOTH ---
It's a classic study
Of things we do for our best friend
When you love somebody
--- MICHAEL ---
You see it to the end
--- BOTH ---
When you love somebody
--- JEREMY’S DAD ---
The conclusion's foregone
--- BOTH ---
When you love somebody you put your big boy pants right on
You put your pants on
