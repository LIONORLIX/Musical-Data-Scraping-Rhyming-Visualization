------ The Pitiful Children ------
--- Unknown ---
You were always quite the loser, Jeremy
Then I invaded and you upgraded
Badababa woah
--- Unknown ---
Jeremy, it's true that I found you
But look around you
Woah
--- Unknown ---
All your peers are just so incomple-e-ete
You can't see it, but they're all in pa-a-ain
Their operating system's obsole-e-ete
So let's complete the chains
And get inside those brains
--- Unknown ---
Let's save the pitiful children, woah
Let's save the pitiful children, woah
Let's teach the pitiful children, who just haven't a clue
Just what to do
He-elp them to he-e-elp you
--- Unknown ---
Ah, yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah!
--- Unknown ---
Can you see the vision clearly, Jeremy?
Users embracing and interfacing

Shiny, happy people singing swee-e-etly (yeah)
Gone is human error a-and fear (beeb bop boo beep bop boo beep bop boo beep)
Every issue tucked away so ne-e-eatly
If you feel a sob or tear
Turn that knob and switch that gear
--- Unknown ---
Let's save the pitiful children, yeah
Let's save the pitiful children, yeah yeah yeah ye-yeah yeah
Let's teach the pitiful children, who just haven't a clue
Just what to do
He-elp them and soon this will be you

Let's save the pitiful children, rab beep beep bope
Let's save the pitiful children, re bop bo beep bop bo beep bop bo
Let's teach the pitiful children, who haven't a clue
That's what we do
If that's what we do
--- Unknown ---
Then everything about us is going to be wonderful
We love everything about Squips
Everything about us is going to be so alive
We could never live without Squips
--- Unknown ---
You won't feel left out or unsure
Not pitiful children anymore
'Cause
--- Unknown ---
Everything about us is going to be cool
When... we... rule
