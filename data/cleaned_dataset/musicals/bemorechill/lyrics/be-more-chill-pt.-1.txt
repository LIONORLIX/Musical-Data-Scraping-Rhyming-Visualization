------ Be More Chill PT. 1 ------
--- THE SQUIP ---
Take your hands out of your pockets
Arch your back, puff out your chest
Add some swagger to your gate or
You'll look like a masturbator
Fix your posture, then the rest
--- JEREMY ---
But I AM a masturbator--
--- THE SQUIP ---
We'll fix that
--- Unknown ---
All your nerdiness is ugly
--- JEREMY ---
Nerd? I thought I was more of a geek, but--
--- THE SQUIP ---
All your stammering's a chore
--- JEREMY ---
Wh-wh-what?
--- THE SQUIP ---
Your tics and fidgets are persistent
And your charm is non-existent
Fix your vibe, then fix some more
--- Unknown ---
Buh
--- JEREMY ---
Wha?
--- THE SQUIP ---
Buh
--- JEREMY ---
Wha?
--- THE SQUIP ---
No
--- JEREMY ---
Aah!
--- THE SQUIP ---
Stop
--- Unknown ---
Oh, everything about you is so terrible
Whoa, everything about you makes me wanna die
--- JEREMY ---
Jesus Christ...
--- THE SQUIP ---
So don't freak out
And don't resist
And have no doubt
If I assist
You will
Be more chill
--- Unknown ---
First thing's first, go buy a new shirt
--- JEREMY ---
What's wrong with my shirt--
--- THE SQUIP ---
It's better if you just comply
My job's to color your aesthetic
And make you seem much less pathetic
Just step and fetch, don't ask me why
--- JEREMY ---
How are you with math homework?
--- THE SQUIP ---
I'm a super-computer, Jeremy. I'm made of math.
Oh, everything about you is so terrible
--- PEOPLE IN THE MALL ---
Everything about you sucks!
Everything about you sucks!
--- THE SQUIP ---
Whoa, everything about you makes me wanna die
--- PEOPLE IN THE MALL ---
Everything about you sucks!
Everything about you sucks!
--- THE SQUIP + PEOPLE IN THE MALL ---
All the people in the mall
Think you're such a slob
--- PEOPLE IN THE MALL ---
You're a slob!
Terrible!
Such a slob!
--- THE SQUIP ---
And boy, can I see why!
--- Unknown ---
Now you try picking out a shirt.
That's a girl's shirt.
--- JEREMY ---
Sorry...
--- CHLOE ---
...Jerry?
--- JEREMY ---

--- CHLOE ---
You shop here?
--- JEREMY ---
Oh, yeah all the time--
--- THE SQUIP ---
Never.
--- JEREMY ---
Never. Is what I meant to...
--- THE SQUIP ---
Greet the beta.
--- JEREMY ---
Oh. Hey, Brooke.
--- THE SQUIP ---
You look sexy.
--- JEREMY ---
I can't say that to a hot girl!
--- THE SQUIP ---
Don't smile. Stare intesnsely.
Speak like you don't care about your own death.
--- JEREMY ---
Lookin' pretty sexy, Brooke.
--- BROOKE ---
Thanks.
--- CHLOE ---
Is that a girl's shirt?
--- JEREMY ---
No.
--- THE SQUIP ---
Yes.
--- JEREMY ---
Yes.
--- THE SQUIP ---
Repeat after me--
--- Unknown ---
I saw it in the window
And I couldn't dismiss
--- JEREMY ---
I saw in the window
And I couldn't dismiss
--- THE SQUIP ---
I was dating a girl and
She had a shirt just like this
--- JEREMY ---
I was dating a girl and
She had a shirt just like this

It's still painful
--- JEREMY ---
It's still painful
--- CHLOE ---
So, who was this mystery girl?
--- JEREMY ---
Oh, you've probably never heard of her, so--
--- THE SQUIP ---
Madeline
--- JEREMY ---
Madeline
--- CHLOE ---
What?
--- JEREMY ---
She's French
--- CHLOE ---
Ugh! She is NOT French! She just pretends to be for attention!
--- BROOKE ---
Madeline broke up with you?
--- JEREMY ---
Yeah...
--- THE SQUIP ---
No.
--- JEREMY ---
I mean--
--- THE SQUIP ---
I broke up with her
--- JEREMY ---
I broke up with her
--- THE SQUIP ---
'Cause she was
Cheating on me
--- JEREMY, overselling it ---
'Cause she was
Cheating on me
