------ I Love Play Rehearsal ------
--- Unknown ---
I love play rehearsal
Because its the best!
Because it is fun.
I love play rehearsal
and I get depressed as soon as its done.
But not depressed as in like kill yourself depressed
No, im not into self-harm
Dude, I swear, here check my arm!
See, I just use the word to emphasise a point,
Show the passion I have got
I am passionate a lot.
I have mad, gigantic feelings,
Red and frantic feelings,
About most everything
Like gun control, like spring,
Like if im living up to all I'm meant to be.
I also have a touch of ADD.
Where was I?
Oh, right!
I love play rehearsal,
Cause' you are equiped with direction and text,
Life is easy in rehearsal,
You follow a script so you know what comes next.
Anywho the point that I'm getting to is sometimes life can't work out in the way
It works out in the play
Like the only time I get to be the centre of attention,
Is when I'm Juliet or Blanche DuBois
and can I mention?
That was really one of my best roles,
Did you see that?
And no matter how hard I try,
It's impossible to narrow down the many reasons why,
I love play rehearsal.
I happiness cry whenever it starts!
It's just so universal
Getting to try playing so many parts.
Most humans do one thing for all of their lives,
The thought of that gives me hives!
I've got so many interests I wanna pursue,
And why am I telling this to you?
Guess there's a part of me that wants to.
Back to play rehearsal,
My brain is like 'bzzz'
My heart is like 'wow'
Because we're here at play rehearsal,
and it's starting,
We're starting,
It's starting,
