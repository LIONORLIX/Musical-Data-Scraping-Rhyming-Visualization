------ A Guy That Iâ€™d Kinda Be Into ------
--- Unknown ---
Say there's this person you pass in the hall everyday
You've known him since 7th grade
You're used to thinking about him in a certain way
From the persona that he displays
And then something changes
And he changes
--- Unknown ---
From a guy that you'd never be into
Into a guy that you'd kinda be into
From a guy that I'd never be into
Into a guy that I'd kinda be into
--- Unknown ---
Is he worth it?
Jeremy?
Is he?
--- JEREMY ---
Is she talking about me?
--- SQUIP ---
Of course she is!
I've been activating your pheromones
Keep it up
--- CHRISTINE ---
Say there's this person that you never knew that well
--- COMPANY ---
She is totally into you!
--- CHRISTINE ---
You thought that you had him pegged
But now you can tell he's gone
--- Unknown ---
From a guy that you'd never be into
Into a guy that you'd kinda be into
From a guy that I'd never be into
Into a guy that I'd kinda be into
--- Unknown ---
Is he worth it?
Jeremy?
--- COMPANY ---
Absolutely
--- CHRISTINE ---
I don't always relate to other people my age
Except when I'm on the stage
There are so many changes that I'm going through
And why am I telling this to you?
--- Unknown ---
Guess there's a part of me that wants to
I guess a part of me wants to
Who knew?
I guess a part of me likes to talk to you
I guess a part of me likes to
Who knew?
--- Unknown ---
I guess a part of me likes to sit with you
I guess a part of me likes to
Who knew?
I guess a part of me likes to hang with you
I guess a part of me...
--- Unknown ---
Back to play rehearsal
I know that it's weird
But it's totally true
--- Unknown ---
A guy that I'd kinda be into
--- JEREMY ---
The guy that you'd kind of be into
--- CHRISTINE ---
Yeah
--- BOTH ---
That guy that you'd/I'd kinda be into
--- CHRISTINE ---
