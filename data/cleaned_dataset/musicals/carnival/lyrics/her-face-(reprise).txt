------ Her Face (Reprise) ------
--- Paul:	 Lili ---
--- Unknown ---
Everywhere I look
Jacquot treats me nice
I can see her face	 Why can’t he be nice like Jacquot?
I can see her face	 How can I stay here
See it everywhere
With a man who makes me hate him
And when I close my eyes it stays
Now a kiss, now a kiss, why a kiss from him
And like a leaf, whirls on a limb
How can he be so sweet
Around my mind it plays
--- Unknown ---
If in my two hands I could hold her face
He won’t speak for days
When he speaks he makes me tremble
While my fingertips kiss her eyes and lips
All of this is wrong, everything is going wrong
And make them love and light and shine
It’s the truth, I hate him
But that would take two other hands
What shall I do with him I know
Not mine
How can I stay here with him
That would take two other hands
I hate him, I hate him
Not mine
I hate him
