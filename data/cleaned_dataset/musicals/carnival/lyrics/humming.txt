------ Humming ------
--- Rosalie ---
--- Unknown ---
Here’s to the son of a B
Tra la
For what he’s doing to me
Tra la
Draining the blood from each vein
--- Schlegel ---
--- Unknown ---
Heh heh
--- Rosalie ---
--- Unknown ---
Torture and anguish and pain
--- Schlegel ---
--- Unknown ---
Heh heh
--- Rosalie ---
--- Unknown ---
Why don’t I have any brains?
Ah ha
--- Both ---
--- Unknown ---
Here’s to the son of a B
--- Rosalie ---
--- Unknown ---
He’ll be humming
When I walk into that trailer
He’ll be humming
He’ll grin a little grin
Force a little laughter
Nonchalant and casual as a bride the morning after
My innocent my saint my darling baby boy
Batting his eyelashes like an aging Fauntleroy
--- Schlegel ---
--- Unknown ---
Here’s to the miserable dog
--- Rosalie ---
--- Unknown ---
Tra la
--- Schlegel ---
--- Unknown ---
And to his raven black curls
--- Rosalie ---
--- Unknown ---
Tra la
I only live for the day
Tra la
His hair will be thinning and grey
Or better than that
A toupee
--- Both ---
--- Unknown ---
Ha ha
Here’s to the miserable dog
--- Rosalie ---
--- Unknown ---
He is humming
I know what he’s doing now
He’s humming
Striking matches in the air to get rid of her perfume
Smoothing pillows, cleaning ashtrays, looking all around the room
Did she spill a little powder
Did she lose one of her combs
Gad he’s changed me from a woman to a lousy Sherlock Holmes
--- Unknown ---
I’m tired of being d?class?
He lies and he cheats and that’s not fair play
You don’t treat a mistress quite that way
That dirty rat
He treats me like a wife
--- Schlegel ---
--- Unknown ---
Here’s to the treacherous heel
--- Rosalie ---
--- Unknown ---
Tra la
--- Schlegel ---
--- Unknown ---
And to the throb in his heart
--- Rosalie ---
--- Unknown ---
Tra la
Wait for a few years to pass
Tra la
He’ll keep his teeth in a glass
Tra la
And that throb in his heart will be gas
--- Both ---
--- Unknown ---
Ha ha
Here’s to the treacherous heel
--- Rosalie ---
--- Unknown ---
He’ll be humming
When I walk into that trailer
He’ll be humming
Admiring his chin in the mirror on the shelf
Smug and satisfied, throwing kisses at himself
Then tonight, I’d say at midnight, with a loud impassioned cluck
He’ll be after me and groaning like a strangulated duck
I’ll see him coming, I’ll walk out and slam the door
And that will kill him
What’s good for the gander is good for the goose
I’ll get a little tight, I’ll be a little loose
I won’t get home ‘til morning
And I’ll give him no excuse
--- Unknown ---
Oh I’ll be humming
When I walk into that trailer
I’ll be humming
I’ll have him going crazy
While I’m humming
Ha ha ha
