------ She's My Love ------
--- Paul ---
--- Unknown ---
She is soft, she is fair
She’s my love
She is song, she is prayer
She’s my love
Though I reach, though I try
She is braver than I
And is far less of earth than she is of sky
--- Unknown ---
She is moon to my night
She’s my love
She is sight, sound, and light
She’s my love
Still the one heart I own
Hungers lost and alone
For my love’s never known
She’s my love
--- Unknown ---
Still the one heart I own
Hungers lost and alone
For my love’s never known
