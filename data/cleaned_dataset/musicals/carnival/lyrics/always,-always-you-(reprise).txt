------ Always, Always You (Reprise) ------

--- Unknown ---
It was always, always you
Always, always you
You would cheat your mother
In your heart a thief, dear
Still I want no other
Doctor, lawyer, Indian chief, dear
--- Unknown ---
Life is strange
A man can change
Though years could find me basking in the sun
But all the same, Iâ€™ll dress for rain
