------ A Sword And A Rose And A Cape ------
--- Marco ---
--- Unknown ---
In me you see a relic of a long lamented age
When masculine behavior wrote a grand romantic page
With every man a lover like a hero on a stage
With a sword and a rose and a cape
--- Unknown ---
Where are the great romantics who would languish for a rose
Who fought a duel with one hand while the other hand wrote prose
Who scale my lady’s balcony and swung upon her drape
With a sword and a rose and a cape
--- Unknown ---
They have flown, have flown like ashes
Or they reappear in flashes
--- Chorus ---
--- Unknown ---
But they find themselves contrary to the point
--- Marco ---
--- Unknown ---
These aristocrats and highbrows
Meet with such astonished eyebrows
--- Chorus ---
--- Unknown ---
They endeavor proudly wither and for rot
--- Marco ---
--- Unknown ---
Where are the flaming Frenchmen and the seething Viennese
In Spain today they’ll hug a horse and let a mistress freeze
And now the male Italian just gets passionate for cheese
Oh, the sword and the rose and the cape
--- Unknown ---
And so if when I look at you I flutter like a moth
It’s just that I am of the breed and woven from the cloth
Of men who live to fight a duel or plight a lover’s troth
A man who would twine her hair or peel my lady’s grape
Leap from her balcony and glorious escape
--- Chorus ---
--- Unknown ---
Play on her harpsichord and perpetrate her rape
--- Marco ---
--- Unknown ---
Perpetrate her rape?
--- Chorus ---
--- Unknown ---
With a sword and a rose and a cape
