The rich put cream on their berries
The rich drive shiny black cars
--- Puppets ---
--- Unknown ---
The rich go here
The rich go there
--- Lili ---
--- Unknown ---
It’s close to the truth
--- Puppets ---
--- Unknown ---
But far from fair
--- Lili ---
--- Unknown ---
The rich stay cozy all winter
--- Puppets ---
--- Unknown ---
Stay cold the month of July
--- Lili and the Puppets ---

But for all of the world
We wouldn’t switch
We’re glad we’re rich

Gee, Lili, I didn’t know you could sing like that. You just hit a high C.

I’m sorry, Carrot Top, I won’t do it again.

That is a compliment, dear, very few girls are able to reach a C. I of course, have been known to reach high M about L. I’ll never forget, when I was playing Carmen in Aida…

The rich put cream on their berries

Or was it Aida in Carmen?

Stay cold the month of July

Of course, my best role was Barbara of Seville…
