------ Boys and Girls Like You and Me ------
--- Unknown ---
We walk on every city street
We walk in lanes where branches meet
And stars send down their blessings from the blue.
We go through storms of doubt and fear
And so we walk from year to year
Believing in each other as we do.
Bravely marching forward two by two...
--- Unknown ---
Boys and girls like you and me
Walk beneath the skies
They love just as we love
With the same dream in their eyes.
Songs and kings and many things
Have their day and are gone
But boys and girls like you and me
We go on and on.

We Will Be Together
Wayne and Emily:
We will be together,
Singing in the sun.
You'll be close to me as 'B' to 'A.'
Two contented voices,
Blended into one,
We'll go harmonizing on our way.
When we drift apart as people do,
I'll come harmonizing back to you.
Doesn't matter whether we have rain or sun!
We'll have sun if we can sing together!
We will be together,
Singing in the sun.
You'll be close to me as 'B' to 'A.'
Two contented voices,
Blended into one.
We'll go harmonizing on our way.
When we drift apart as people do,
I'll come harmonizing back to you.
Doesn't matter whether we have rain or sun!
