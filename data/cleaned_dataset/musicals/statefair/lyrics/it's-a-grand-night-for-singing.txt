------ It's a Grand Night for Singing ------
--- Marty ---
It's a grand night for singing,
The moon is flying high,
And somewhere a bird
Who is bound he'll be heard,
Is throwing his heart at the sky!
It's a grand night for singing,
The stars are bright above.
The earth is a-glow
And, to add to the show,
I think I am falling in love!
Falling, falling in love!
--- All ---
It's a grand night for singing,
The moon is flying high,
And somewhere a bird
Who is bound he'll be heard,
Is throwing his heart at the sky!
It's a grand night for singing,
The stars are bright above.
The earth is a-glow
And, to add to the show,
I think I am falling in love!
Falling, falling in love!
--- Wayne ---
Maybe it's more than the moon,
Maybe it's more than the birds,
Maybe it's more than the sight of the night,
And a light too lovely for words!
Maybe it's more than the earth,
Shiny and silvery blue,
Maybe the reason I'm feeling this way
Has something to do with you!

It's a grand night for singing,

Is throwing his heart at the sky!

The stars are bright above.
The earth is a-glow
And, to add to the show,
I think I am falling in love!
Falling, falling in love!
