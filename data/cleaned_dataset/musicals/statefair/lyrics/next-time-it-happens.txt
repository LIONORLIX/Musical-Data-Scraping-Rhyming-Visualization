------ Next Time It Happens ------
--- MARGY ---
I leapt before I looked and I got hooked
I played with fire and burned, that's how I learned
I must admit I owe a lot to you
From now on I will know what not to do
The next time it happens
I'll know what not to do
--- Unknown ---
The next time it happens
I'll be wise enough to know
Not to trust my eyesight
When my eyes begin to glow
--- Unknown ---
The next time I'm in love
With anyone like you
My heart will sing no love song
Till I know the words are true
--- Unknown ---
The next time it happens
What a foolish thing to say
Who expects a miracle
To happen every day?
--- Unknown ---
It isn't in the cards
As far as I can see
That a thing so
Beautiful and wonderful
Could happen more than once to me
--- Unknown ---
The next time I'm in love
With anyone like you
My heart will sing no love song
Till I know the words are true
--- Unknown ---
The next time it happens
What a foolish thing to say!
Who expects a miracle
To happen every day?
--- Unknown ---
It isn't in the cards
As far as I can see
That a thing so
Beautiful and wonderful
Could happen more than once
Could happen more than once
