Woman: And the Lord God said,
this is how the book of man and women shall be written

Man: Endlessly crashing into eachother like two vengeful bumber cars-
Romeo, Romeo, where for art thou, Romeo?
You played it for her, you can play it for me.
My man done did me wrong.
Chicks and ducks and geese better scurry
I got it bad and bad aint good
You make me feel like a natural woman.
She was just 17 if you know what I mean
Love to Love ya baby!

All: Keep coming back
I keep coming back
I keep coming back to this whirlwind tour
Of loving, and leaving, and wanting more
I swear that I swore off of love before
Woman 1: But I,
Man 1: But I,
All: But I
Keep coming back
