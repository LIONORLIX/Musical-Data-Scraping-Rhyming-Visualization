------ Shouldn't I Be Less in Love With You? ------
--- Unknown ---
Man: The experts say it does not last.
The experts say it's fleeting.
The experts bray love fades so fast
Then tell me why is my heart still beating?
--- Unknown ---
Shouldn't I be less in love with you?
Shouldn't I address what time can do?
Shouldn't I be more inclined to flee?
Shouldn't I explore all I can be?
--- Unknown ---
Shouldn't I confess a sorted fling?
Shouldn't I carress a cute young thing?
Shouldn't I asses what we've been through?
Shouldn't I be less in love with you?
--- Unknown ---
After 30 years together
All those brutal fights
those futal fights
then the sleepless nights
--- Unknown ---
Shouldn't I have quit 'cause marriage ends?
Shouldn't we have split like all our friends?
Shouldn't I profess it's time to go?
Shouldn't I be less in love with you?
No.
