------ I Will Be Loved Tonight ------
--- Woman 1 ---
Well, pop the champagne, break out the cologne;
turn up the monnlight and turn off the phone.
Well, what a surprise, a man is in sight; and I will be loved tonight.
To fondle his skin, to savor his lips;
to nuzzle his chin, to movie with his hips. our words wil be soft as we softly ignite;
and I will be loved tonight.
You can go from week to week, you can go from year to year;
not a hand placed on your cheek, not a whisper in your ear.
You can make it through okay, you can live and laugh, and flirt.
It's quite easy in the day; its just the nights that always hurt.
So let darkness come, 'cause that will be fine;
for I'll have a soul entangled in mine.
We'll do as we please, and please... hold me tight.
For I will be loved, I will be loved.
