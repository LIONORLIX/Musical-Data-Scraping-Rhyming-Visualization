What's wrong with her she seems like such a nice girl.
But we don't need to pry, relax you happy guy.
Adulthood's not a crucial as it seems.
For grandkids we can wait, no need to procreate.
Who care if you've destroyed your parents dreams,
Big career girl, wayward son, future spinster, dissapointment.
