------ Unexpressed ------
--- Unknown ---
Sometimes I think my heart will burst
Like a balloon inside my chest
With all the love thats waiting here,
Unexpressed.
--- Unknown ---
Fingers that ache to intertwine
Warmest of chords, but missing tune
Where is the laugh to echo mine
Send it soon
--- Unknown ---
The words my lips would form,
The circle these two arms would make safe and warm
Someone could be safe and warm
--- Unknown ---
But,
Maybe the love we yearn to give,
Can find a release some ther way,
Coloring how we choose to live every day
The kindness we can share
--- Unknown ---
(musical interlude)
--- Unknown ---
The kindness we can share
The comfort these two arms might lend in despair
Someone's always in despair
--- Unknown ---
Still I'm,
Longing to meet that pair of eyes
Dark as the night or endless blue
Holding a light I'll recognize
Something clear, something true
--- Unknown ---
Something that seems to mean,
Something I haven't seen since,
You
