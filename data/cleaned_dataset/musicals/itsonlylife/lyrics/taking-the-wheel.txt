------ Taking the Wheel ------
--- Unknown ---
It's no good, it's too packed
I can't just sing a final song
Say so long and leave it at that.
It's alright, I've got time
--- Unknown ---
So I didn't hitch a ride on the rocket to the top
I'll get there in a steady climb
What did it mean, what have I learned
Crossing the bridges before they're burned
Leading life, instead of being lead
--- Unknown ---
Using my head
What's it about
Did I lose innocence going in, or gain experience coming out
What did it mean, what have I learned
Eating off tables, before they're turned
Living life, instead of playing dead
--- Unknown ---
Throwing down a pencil, grabbing a pen
Taking the wheel, driving again
Throwing down a pencil, writing in ink
This is how I feel, this is what I think
Dreaming again, and making those dreams real
No big deal
--- Unknown ---
I hit my stride
If I'm not breaking the ribbon at the end of the race
It's only because I haven't tried
What did it mean, what have I learned
Taking the credit I know I've earned
Waking up, and flying out of bed
--- Unknown ---
Throwing down a pencil, grabbing a pen
Taking the wheel, driving again
Throwing down a pencil, writing in ink
This is how I feel, this is what I think
Dreaming again, and making those dreams real
Taking the wheel
--- Unknown ---
I've been in a back seat long enough
Tagging along for the ride
I've been in a back seat long enough to know
That you never get what you deserve
If you never can decide
There's only one way to get where you want to go
--- Unknown ---
Throwing down a pencil, grabbing a pen
Taking the wheel, driving again
Throwing down a pencil, writing in ink
This is how I feel, this is what I think
I'm dreaming again, and making those dreams real
Taking the wheel
--- Unknown ---
I've been in a back seat long enough
Tagging along for the ride
I've been in a back seat long enough to know
That you never get what you deserve
If you never can decide
There's only one way to get where you want to go
--- Unknown ---
Throwing down a pencil, grabbing a pen
Taking the wheel, driving again
Throwing down a pencil, writing in ink
This is how I feel, this is what I think
Dreaming again and making those dreams real
Dreaming again and making those dreams real
Dreaming again and making those dreams real
Taking the wheel
