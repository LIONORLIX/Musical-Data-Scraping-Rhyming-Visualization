------ Love Will Find You in Its Time ------
--- Man ---
A bar room, a bus stop, a market, a party, in costume or (feeling brave?) come as you are.
The right line, the right time, enough wine to plan your approach to the one you?ve admired from afar.
Wondering will the right connection bring you peace of mind.
A looker, no interest, you move on (an airhead not worthy to share bed with someone like you.)
Another selection, another rejection, escape with your pride is the best you can do.
But you know love will find you in its time.
--- Woman ---
He?s perfect, he?s everything I wanted. You?ve got to see him, he even does the dishes.
And flowers! He?s always bringing flowers! The house is full of flowers!
I know flowers die.
Not this time, he?s perfect, he?s all I ever dreamed of.
Well maybe not perfect, but we all have our problems.
If I can love him enough we?ll make it. No, I don?t want to change him.
Well maybe a little, but only for his own good. He?s leaving!?
I can?t imagine why?
[spoken]
I?m perfect for him!
--- Man ---
They break down, you give up, no way they can live up to some ideal vision of one that will last.
You?ve been misdirected no matter how empty or how disconnected you?ve felt in the past,
--- Woman {Man} ---
A bar room, a bus stop, a market, a party?
{I?m here to tell you love will teach you.}
Another selection, another rejection.
{Love can always reach you.}
Escape with your pride!
{Love will find you in its time.}
