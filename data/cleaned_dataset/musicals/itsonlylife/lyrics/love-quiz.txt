------ Love Quiz ------
--- Unknown ---
Thanks for playing my romantic lead
Even if only in the version I colorized
Fantasized
You and me
In a porch swing in front of a sunset somewhere
I took a love quiz in a women's magazine
You failed two out of three areas
And you only passed the third
When my libido threw in a grading curve
Your eyes are locked
Not our eyes
Your eyes locked
from my eyes
Not to them.
I tried to like you less and less
Til I'd reach a point where you liked me more than I liked you
You jerk
I could never feel little enough for that to work
And besides my eyes tend to give me away
And you can sense the huge energy of restraint
In my not touching you or slugging you
You know how hoard it is to keep from loving you
Your eyes are locked
Not our eyes
Your eyes locked
from my eyes
Not to them.
I know you always feel you've fallen short
Let me down
you're wrong
you set me up and the fall just rolled around
After a white hot summer that burned too short for me
Will this fall be short?
I guess I'll have to wait and see.
And what about winter with the heat turned off
Will I huddle in a blanket of memories torn and tattered
The window may be shattered but the door's not locked.
Your eyes are locked
Not our eyes
Your eyes locked
from my eyes
Not to them.
Thanks for playing my romantic lead
Even if only in the version I colorized
Fantasized
You and me
In a porch swing in front of a sunset somewhere
Thanks for playing you part so well
I came out of it with a bruised heart but what the hell
I felt some things I must've needed to remember
All because
Your eyes are locked
Not our eyes
Your eyes locked
from my eyes
No key in sight
Your eyes are locked
Not our eyes
Your eyes locked
from my eyes
