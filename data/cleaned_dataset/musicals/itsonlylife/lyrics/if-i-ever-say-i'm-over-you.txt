------ If I Ever Say I'm Over You ------
--- Unknown ---
If I ever say I'm over you
The unsentimental things I do
Will have driven out the ghosts,
Somehow,
And pulled me through
--- Unknown ---
If I tend to disregard your touch
Well, it seems to me it would be
Such a waste of time to let this poor heart
Feel that much
--- Unknown ---
But sometimes a photograph
Can make me cry or force a laugh
And somehow the memory
Of how complete we used to be
Is keeping me from you
--- Unknown ---
If you ever hear me doubt the past
It's a simple fact; we didn't last
Run aground on hard times
While the good times flew too fast
--- Unknown ---
I'm not sure if we can make amends
This may be the way out story ends
With too little left for lovers
And too much for friends
--- Unknown ---
But sometimes a photograph
Can make me cry or force a luagh
And somehow the memory
Of how complete we used to be
Is keeping me from you
So don't believe it's true
