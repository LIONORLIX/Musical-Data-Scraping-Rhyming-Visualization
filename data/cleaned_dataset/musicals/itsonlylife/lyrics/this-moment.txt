------ This Moment ------
--- Unknown ---
This moment, perfect, golden, grasp it, see it.
This moment, laughing, happy, feel it, be it.
--- Unknown ---
Curve of face, Warmth of hands, Butterfly
Pin in place, When it lands, Try, try
--- Unknown ---
This moment, ripened, bursting, taste it, name it
This moment, precious, fleeting, catch it, frame it.
Curve of moon, warmth of air, willow bow
Winter soon, be aware now, how
--- Unknown ---
This sadness, aching, reaching,looking on
at this moment, present, distant
Shining, bauble, touch it, lose it.
Happy, laughing, perfect, golden, gone.
