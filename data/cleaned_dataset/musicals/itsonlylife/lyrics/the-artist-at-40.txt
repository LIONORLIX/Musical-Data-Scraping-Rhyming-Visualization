------ The Artist at 40 ------
--- Man 1 ---
I?m afraid to be to little,
I?m afraid to be too much,
I?m afraid that I might shatter at the slightest touch.
I?m afraid of growing older,
I?m afraid someday I?ll see
A desiccated shell that doesn?t feel at all like me.
--- Unknown ---
Creating,
Creating and talk about creating
I?m so busy making art that there?s no time to live the art the life is imitating.
--- Woman 1 ---
Too frozen
[Man 2]
Too fluid
[Man 3}
Too rigid
[Woman 2]
Too limp
--- Woman 1 ---
I?m afraid to throw the lights on
I?m afraid to brave the dark
I?m afraid of growing older, growing colder, losing some essential spark.
Having birthdays with more candles, shedding more light on the fact
That I?m no wiser than I was, and there?s no way of turning back
--- Man 1 ---
Creating,
Creating and talk about creating
[Man 1 + Woman 1]
I?m so busy making art that there?s no time to live the art the life is imitating.
--- Man 1 ---
I?m afraid of eating candy for the momentary sweetness
--- Woman 1 ---
I?m afraid of growing older, well maybe growing older would be fine, but shrinking older,
That?s a major fear of mine
Sinking to mere thinking from a laughing gas ceiling of unfettered feeling
Falling with a thud to the floor
In the single tiny bedroom of the mansion where I lived and loved before
A single tiny bedroom with a barricaded door
--- Man 2 ---
I?m afraid to love to little
I?m afraid to love too much
I?m afraid that I might shutter, not like butter, at the lightest touch
I?m afraid of pulling back
I?m afraid of falling in
--- Man 2 + Man 3 ---
Oh such warm and intoxicating skin a sinful opportunity to steep in
Arms to sleep in, lips to keep in, riding me back for more
[Man 2, Man 3, Woman 1]
Just the other side of this damn barricaded door
[All]
Creating, Creating
--- Man 2 ---
Ha!
--- Man 3 ---
I?m afraid of being home
[Man 1]
I?m afraid to fall apart
[Man 2]
I?m afraid to take another step with such a heavy heart
[Woman 1]
I?m afraid to be myself, I?m afraid its not enough
[Woman 2]
I?m afraid to keep complaining but it?s not within my training to be tight lipped and tough
--- All ---
Creating,
Creating and talk about creating
I?m so busy making art that there?s no time to live the art the life is imitating.
--- Man 3 ---
I?m afraid that I?m not learning what it takes to make life shine
That the pages I see shining as they?re turning somehow aren?t really mine
--- All ---
There?s a secret in here somewhere, or a pattern or a clue.
I?m afraid I can?t decide if it?s a shining universal answer
