------ It Feels Like Home ------
--- Unknown ---
I hear your key in the door
Unlocking more than wood
The ceiling may not be dry yet
But it feels like home
--- Unknown ---
Yes, we have come from a long way
Friends say wrong way
Still, I only know when you hold me
It feels like home
--- Unknown ---
We don't need a dining room table
So far there's no one to invite
For me a cardboard box will do just fine
As long as I'm with you each night
--- Unknown ---
It seems to me if you never ask
You'll never win
And since we're in this together
It feels like home
--- Unknown ---
We don't need a dining room table
So far there's no one to invite
For me a cardboard box will do just fine
As long as I'm with you each night
--- Unknown ---
Yes, we have come from a long way
Friends say wrong way
Still, I only know when you hold me
It feels like home
It feels like home
