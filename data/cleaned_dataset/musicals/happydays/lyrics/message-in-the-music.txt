------ Message in the Music ------
--- Unknown ---
Maybe you'll find a message in the music
The drummer could be speaking to your soul
When you tune into the groove
And let your body move
You're playing with the power of Rock and Roll

There's harmonies that can pick you up and hold you
A rhythm that has gospel at it's core
When the feeling gets so strong
That the singer and his song
Get you out of your seat and spin you 'cross the floor

It's cause music is the language of romance
And lovers dont need words when they can dance
