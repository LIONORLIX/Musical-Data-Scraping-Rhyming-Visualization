------ Dancing on the Moon ------
--- Fonz ---
If we traced our life together, from tonight to way back when
We?d walk a path of busted plans, things that might?ve been
But a thousand nights I?d lay awake and wondered if you knew
My favorite dreams begin and end with you
--- Pinky ---
There is a sweet bridge between us that no one else can see
You are my love song, my hometown, my perfect fantasy
--- Fonz ---
I knew if you looked long enough, I?d find you
Now the future holds a promise that someday
I will take you dancing we will go dancing on the moon
Just you and I
And we?ll hear angels whisper and they will keep our hearts in two
--- Pinky ---
We?ll show ?em how to fly
--- Fonz ---
I?ll fill our nights with memories to treasure
And the stars will build a castle just for you
--- Instrumental ---
--- Pinky ---
There a longing, a passion that even time can?t tame
And there?s a comfort, a welcome, each time you say my name
--- Both ---
And if there was word for just past always
I?d use it when I?d promise love to you
I will take you dancing we will go dancing on the moon
--- Pinky ---
Just you and I
--- Both ---
And we?ll hear angels whisper
--- Fonz ---
And they will keep our hearts in two
--- Pinky ---
We?ll show ?em how to fly
--- Both ---
I?ll fill our nights with memories to treasure
--- Fonz ---
And the stars will build a castle
--- Both ---
Just for you
I will take you dancing
--- Fonz ---
Dancing
--- Both ---
Dancing.
