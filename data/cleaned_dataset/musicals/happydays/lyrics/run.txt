------ Run ------
--- Unknown ---
Sometimes just a little bit scared can be a good thing
Sometimes just a little bit scared brings out your best
When you need to bite the bullet
Or to walk right through some pain
Try thinking like a hero
And then acting like John Wayne
--- Unknown ---
John Wayne
--- Unknown ---
Get on with it, pilgrim
Do the deed that must be done
--- Unknown ---
Of course the other option is to
Run, run, run, run, run, run
--- Unknown ---
Run like the wind
Fly like a kite
Disappear like drumsticks do
At dinner on a sunday night
--- Unknown ---
Maybe it's time to face the music
Maybe you're the only one
You can rise to the occasion
Or you can
Run, run, run, run, run, run
--- Unknown ---
Sometimes a little bit scared
Improves your chances
--- Unknown ---
Sometimes just a little bit scared
Becomes a plus
--- Unknown ---
Even though your knees are knocking
You're an asset to the team
--- Unknown ---
When you manage not to just pass out
And resist the urge to scream
--- Unknown ---
You're headed for the wheaties box
You're a champion...number one
But to fight another day sometimes we
Run, run, run, run, run
--- Unknown ---
We may run a fever
We may run a light
And we may run for office some day
But we will never run from a fight
--- Unknown ---
Are we Wisconsin Warriors
Are we Milwaukee Mice
We'll stand our ground and get the job done
--- Unknown ---
We will never
Run, run, run,
Run, run, run,
Run, run, run,
Run, run, run,
--- Unknown ---
We may run a fever
We may run a light
And we may run for office some day
But we will never run from a fight
--- Unknown ---
We're scared to death but while we've got breath
We will never
Run, run, run, run, run
