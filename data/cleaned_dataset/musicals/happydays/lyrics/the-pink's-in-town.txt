------ The Pink's in Town ------
--- Unknown ---
I come racin' into town
Settin' hearts on fire
I ride a big pink Harley
That I call 'Desire'
Heads start turnin'
When the Pink
Shows up
Wait!
This one's mine if
He ever grows up
--- Unknown ---
Travelin' the country
Stretchin' their imaginations
Got a reputation
Yeah the word gets around
Got a thirst for adventure
Drinkin' up the sweet sensations
Breakin' taboos
Knockin' down walls
Fillin' up arenas
Fillin' them halls
--- Unknown ---
Yeah the word gets around
Yeah the word gets around
Time to get the party started
You know The Pink Is In Town
--- Unknown ---
(Dance Break)
--- Unknown ---
Yeah the word gets around
Yeah the word gets around
Time to get the party started
You know The Pink Is In Town
--- Unknown ---
Yeah the word gets around
Yeah the word gets around
Time to get the party started
You know The Pink Is In Town
Yeah!
Yeah!
