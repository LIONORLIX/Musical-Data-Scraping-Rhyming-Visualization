--- MATT ---
Ivy’s birthday’s in a week
I want to get her something...
--- LUCAS ---
Matt...
--- NADIA ---
How about a pair of faker boobs?
An STD she hasn’t had?
--- TANYA ---
You should throw her a surprise
--- RORY ---
We’ll help you make it uppercrust
--- MATT ---
Well, maybe something small...you’ll help?
--- NADIA ---
Oh, Matthew...where’s the trust?
--- IVY ---
Trust for what?
--- NADIA ---
That you’ve done smut
--- MATT ---
Oh, we’re just talking about the rave
--- LUCAS ---
[waving bags of drugs] I made the snacks
--- KYRA ---
I’ve got the guys
--- IVY ---
I guess we’re set
--- LUCAS ---
We need a ride
--- RORY ---
The church’s van
--- ZACH ---
You have the keys
--- MATT ---
So I should steal it?
--- NADIA ---
Borrow!
--- LUCAS ---
Why not?
--- IVY ---
Please?
--- MATT ---
Where do I begin?
--- RORY ---
It’s all we got
--- LUCAS ---
One little sin
--- LUCAS ---
Come to wonderland where never never finds you
Your one enchanted night of dreams disguised in swirling lights
Ten thousand friends to make an ecstasy of motion
You’re floating, rolling, free to drown in possibility
--- MATT ---
How far away is this rave?
--- LUCAS ---
Just make sure the tank is full
--- TANYA ---
Just come
--- MATT ---
This map is kinda vague
--- LUCAS ---
When we’re close we’ll feel the pull
--- JASON ---
I have some clothes that you can wear
--- MATT ---
And what is that supposed to mean?
--- KYRA ---
You look like a million bucks
Wear something cheeper to the scene
--- MATT ---
There’s no way to cross this road
--- PETER ---
I think the map is upside down
--- LUCAS ---
Our parents had it easier
The disco didn’t move around
--- KYRA ---
Yeah, but who can groove to that?
And what’s with spelling with your hands?
--- RORY ---
Yeah and could you ever see them roll?
--- EVERYONE ---
God, they’d never understand
Off to wonderland where never never finds you
For one enchanted night of dreams disguised in swirling lights
Ten thousand friends to make an ecstasy of motion
You’re floating, rolling, free to drown in possibility
--- LUCAS ---
There’s more than one way to feel alive
That’s why the party never ends
Though X is still the treat of choice
I brought along some friends
Boys and girls our show today
Is brought to you by the letters ‘G’ and ‘K’
--- MATT ---
What?
--- LUCAS ---
G and K fool!
There both intense
They enhance your X experience!
--- NADIA ---
Professor-
--- LUCAS ---
Exibit A:
K! Powder, white, and what a roll
But take too much and beware the hole
The K Hole is a lonely prison
Echoed words and tunnel vision
This much, heaven’s where you’re headed
More, and you’ll regret it!
Exibit B.
G! Liquid, clear, a bitter treat
You’re rolling smooth this shit is sweet
Two capful’s the most you take
Any more’s a big mistake
This much after X - well fed!
More than that, my friends? You’re dead
It’s fun for all and all for fun
But keep in mind rule number one:
They say, like X, this shit has limits
Play the game, but please stay in it...
[to Matt]Are you in or not?
--- MATT ---
Ok, what time?
--- LUCAS ---
We’d have to leave by nine...
--- TANYA ---
Come on it’ll be fun!
--- MATT ---
Well I dont know, maybe...
[they try to convince him, Tanya gestures to Ivy to give it a try]
IVY
Maybe?
--- MATT ---
Alright I’ll go
--- Everyone cheers but Ivy ---
--- PETER ---
Can I borrow this for tonight?
--- JASON ---
Yeah but I don’t think you’re going to be wearing it that long
--- PETER ---
Promise?
--- JASON ---
If you’re lucky
--- They kiss deeply ---
--- PETER ---
We should get going, we’re going to be late
--- NADIA ---
[Looking at Ivy’s outfit]Oh thank God!
I haven’t seen your belly button for hours
--- IVY ---
Y’know, I’ve noticed that some of my clothes are missing
--- NADIA ---
Uh, yah, I think we’ve all noticed that
--- MATT ---
Hey...
Ready ladies?
--- NADIA ---
I’m not going
--- MATT ---
Aww, come on
--- NADIA ---
I said no
Fucking go already...
--- Unknown ---
JASON?
Alright
--- IVY ---
Well, you have yourself a good night
And don’t touch anything
--- NADIA ---
...says the whore, uncharacteristically...
