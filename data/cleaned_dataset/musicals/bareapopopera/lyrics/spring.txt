------ Spring ------
--- NADIA ---
Spring, a time for love, a time for two
A time when lovers start to coo
Spring can lick me
--- IVY ---
Are you almost finished with this pretty ode?
--- NADIA ---
Spring, to spread the spirit I
Rip wings off butterflies
Then show small children
If you see me on Groundhog Day
Stay the hell out of my way
I'll be the one with a gun (?)
Spring, I hate the word
As I hate Hell, all Juliets, and class
Mother Nature is a turd
She can shove her flowers right up her ass
Tra-la-la
If I ran the show, I'd say baby...baby...let it snow!
--- IVY ---
Hey
Leaving soon?
--- JASON ---
Tonight
--- IVY ---
Yeah, me too
Are you ok?
--- JASON ---
Yeah, hanging in there
--- IVY ---
Good
Listen, I...I just didn't want to take off without
Apologizing for the way I acted at my party
I was wasted, I didn't mean to throw myself at you
--- JASON ---
It's ok...it was cute (?)
