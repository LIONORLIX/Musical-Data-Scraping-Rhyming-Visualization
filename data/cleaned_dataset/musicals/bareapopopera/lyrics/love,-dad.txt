------ Love, Dad ------
--- NADIA ---
Wow! Congratulations Romeo, the lead in the play
Dad will be excited...
--- JASON ---
Yeah, I'm looking forward to that conversation
--- NADIA ---
Conversation? I'm don't think I've ever had one of those with Dad
--- JASON ---
Approach the bench Miss McConnell!
_____ our father will hear your case now (?)
--- Unknown ---
Our father, the honorable judge
Presiding over our every decision
--- NADIA ---
And Mom can't take our calls
She's busy planning balls
Exhausting her kindness on strangers
--- JASON ---
Could we have been raised by two warmer people?
--- NADIA ---
Eskimos, maybe
That birthday package showed up two weeks late, not bad
--- JASON ---
Not as bad as last year certainly
--- NADIA ---
Oh, the combined Christmas/Birthday/Easter package
--- JASON ---
Worst birthday?...14!
--- NADIA ---
No, 8! Remember when Dad thought that...
--- JASON ---
...that Mom would...
--- BOTH ---
Disaster!
--- JASON ---
They rented out the zoo
--- NADIA ---
And our nanny walked us through
--- BOTH ---
And both of our parents were no-shows
--- JASON ---
Oh, Nadia, I am so sorry, this day just sneaks up on me every year
--- NADIA ---
Kiddo, you know I rely on your mother to remind me of these things
--- JASON ---
Remember when he said he'd make it up to me?
Two days later I struck out, we lost the game
And he made me walk home alone from the little league park
--- NADIA ---
Here, honey, buy some therapy
Dad's birthday check and...surprise, a note!
(reading note) Dear Jason:
Please find enclosed this very thick package that came for you yesterday
I talked with Father Flynn, and he told me you were in
But call anyway when you open it...Notre Dame!
But we always knew that you'd keep the McConnell flame burning
Love, Dad
--- JASON ---
What did Dad get you?
--- NADIA ---
You mean what did Dad's secretary get me...?
These earrings
