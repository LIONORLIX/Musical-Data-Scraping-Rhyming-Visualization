------ Once Upon A Time ------
--- JASON ---
Once upon a time
I first held your hand
And love was not a crime
In a private world where
You said don't look down?
But then I did and now you?re lost above me
--- Unknown ---
So much left to say
Trapped alone here
With my best laid plans astray
Standing scared outside a cold church
Soul search, seeking some lost answer
From a God who loves me
--- Unknown ---
Can I turn to You in my need?
Would You take me back or watch me bleed?
Are You there? There at all?
And as I fall from the person that I tried to be
Could You really love someone like me?
--- Unknown ---
Once upon a time
All I needed was his hand in mine
Then I lost my way and
Now I know not what I do
I bow my head and turn to You
