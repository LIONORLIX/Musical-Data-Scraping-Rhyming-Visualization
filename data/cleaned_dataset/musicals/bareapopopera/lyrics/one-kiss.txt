------ One Kiss ------
--- IVY ---
Let's make the later sooner
A minute can crawl by when you have
Something you want real bad.
I spent the whole party
Just waiting for us to be alone,
But then you must've known.
Or perhaps you haven't noticed how I stare.
Are you scared?
--- JASON ---
Why should I be frightened?
--- IVY ---
I don't know, but still I can see it in your eyes
They say ?I'm not surprised?
--- JASON ---
At what?
--- IVY ---
That I want to kiss you.
I've wanted to kiss you for so long
--- JASON ---
You're wasted and this is wrong
--- IVY ---
But why?
--- JASON ---
It could wreck the friendship
--- IVY ---
I don't know, I think you're intrigued
--- JASON ---
And why is that?
--- IVY ---
I don't think you have to ask.
Do I see some life stirring in your jeans?
How obscene.
--- JASON ---
So how bout that French kiss?French test?
--- IVY ---
?Voules vous couche...? Oh, what?s the rest?
--- JASON ---
?Avec moi,? I think it goes
--- IVY ---
It could
It's been quite a birthday
--- JASON ---
Did you get anything good?
--- IVY ---
You do know I'm misunderstood
--- JASON ---
Did you make a birthday wish?
--- IVY ---
Oh yes
Sit tight and I'll whisper it in your ear
--- She whispers ---
--- JASON ---
I don't think that's legal here.
--- IVY ---
Don't you want to kiss me?
--- JASON ---
I want to kiss you
--- IVY ---
Don't you want me just like I want you?
Please grant the birthday girl her wish
--- JASON ---
Ok, one kiss...
