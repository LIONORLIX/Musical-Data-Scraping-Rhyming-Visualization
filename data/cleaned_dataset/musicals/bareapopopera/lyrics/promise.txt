------ Promise ------
--- JASON ---
Promise...Webster’s defines promise as
‘a declaration that something will or will not be done’
--- IVY ---
Where have you been? Is this some stupid game?
I meant it when I said I need to talk to you
--- JASON ---
I understand, but Ivy, nothing’s changed
--- IVY ---
You have no idea what I’m going through!
--- JASON ---
I’ll say it one more time
I’m sorry I don’t feel the same
We had ourselves a moment, but it’s gone
My head’s in thirty different places
Please, just try to understand
Let’s leave things at that and just move on!
--- IVY ---
That night...We weren’t safe!
So tell me how we move on!
--- JASON ---
I don’t know what it is you want from me
I don’t have time to hear whatever tale you’ve spun
I have to write this speech before tonight
Plus, there are all these scenes I have to run
--- IVY ---
You know what I am saying!
I would never make this up
You’re a winner, have your perfect back!
Way to go, you got me pregnant
Put that in your fucking speech!
It’s one incredible guy who gives the facts!
--- JASON ---
Shit...Why are you doing this to me?
--- IVY ---
We’re in this together...
--- JASON ---
I’ve got to pull together...
--- IVY ---
We’ll take it one step at a time...
--- JASON ---
This is what I wanted?
Tell me, tell me what to do...
--- IVY ---
Somehow we’ll get through..
Jason, I still love you
Someday maybe...
--- JASON ---
Love me?
--- IVY ---
Someday maybe you can learn...
Maybe you can...
--- JASON ---
Maybe I can...
--- IVY ---
Maybe you can...
--- Unknown ---
JASON / IVY
Learn to love you/me too...
--- IVY ---
Maybe...please...
--- MATT ---
Maybe he would love you
Maybe if he weren’t that way
He wouldn’t treat your feelings like his toy!
Maybe make you feel real special
Like I always wanted to!
But he’s already in love with a boy!
--- IVY ---
What?
--- PETER ---
Am I late?
What’s going on?
--- NADIA ---
Jason, have you seen Ivy?
I guess you have
--- JASON ---
You knew?
--- NADIA ---
Only since this afternoon!
--- PETER ---
Knew what?
--- MATT ---
Ivy’s pregnant and your boyfriend’s a dad!
So what does that make you?
--- JASON ---
What?
--- PETER ---
What the fuck are you talking about ‘my boyfriend?’
--- MATT ---
Don’t play dumb with me, Peter!
--- JASON ---
Get the fuck outta here, Matt!
--- MATT ---
Should I tell them what I saw at the rave?
Look, I’m not here to judge, just keep everyone on the same page
And, hey, I think I found that strong opening
You were looking for in your speech
--- JASON ---
Whatever, Matt, whatever you saw…
--- MATT ---
Ha! Are you gonna stand there and deny it?
I know
--- JASON ---
Oh? You know?
--- MATT ---
Yeah, I fuckin’ know! Oh yeah!
--- IVY ---
Don’t fight!
--- PETER ---
He knows, Jason...He knows because I told him…
It was after Ivy’s birthday. We were drunk. I’m sorry...
No. You know what? I’m not.
--- IVY ---
Peter, what are you talking about? Jason, he’s kidding right? Jason?
--- JASON ---
It’s just that…
If I profane with my unworthiest hand
This holy shrine, the gentle sin is this
--- Ivy slaps Matt? ---
--- PETER ---
Don’t…
--- JASON ---
Peter, I don’t know what’s going on...you gotta help me!
--- PETER ---
I tried…
--- JASON ---
You know what? Then fuck you, Peter! Fuck you…
