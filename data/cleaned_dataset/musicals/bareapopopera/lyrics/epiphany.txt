------ Epiphany ------
--- Unknown ---
STUDENTS (singing in Latin)
In nomine patris, patris
Amen, amen
In nomine patris, patris
Amen, amen
--- PRIEST ---
I want to welcome all of you back
I hope Christmas was a time of great joy for you and your families
Today is the Feast of the Epiphany
The celebration of the arrival of the three wise men
To pay homage to the baby Jesus
I want you to imagine what that journey must have been like
A journey resting entirely on fate
That they would know where they were going once they arrived
Imagine what a joy it must have been for them
To finally reach their destination
Seniors, you're coming to an end of your time at St. Cecelia's
--- LUCAS ---
Yeah!
--- PRIEST ---
You've lived together, studied together
And most importantly, prayed together
Strength for the journey
We begin in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit
Let us take a moment now to call to mind those times
When we have fallen from God's grace
I confess...
--- PRIEST & STUDENTS ---
...to almighty God
And to you my brothers and sisters
That...(students continue praying)
--- PRIEST ---
Peter!
You're not fooling anyone!
Being an altar boy by day doesn't forgive what you do at night!
--- PETER ---
And you, my brothers and sisters
Pray for me to the Lord our God!
--- LUCAS ---
One among us dances with the Devil
--- NADIA ---
Loves my brother, God it makes me sick
--- MATT ---
Seven years in school
--- IVY ---
He's played it cool
--- STUDENTS ---
You can't keep it, tell us your secret
--- NADIA ---
And for risking it all on your salvation
--- IVY ---
I can fix you if you'd like to try
--- MATT ---
Think your actions through
--- STUDENTS ---
What's wrong with you?
So mistaken, lost and forsaken!
Dig down deep and save your soul
Grave mistakes will take their toll
Every sin is entered in
Heaven comes with discipline
--- PETER ---
I've hid it all so well, tell me how you know
--- STUDENTS ---
No more dodging, God is watching
His eye is on the lowly sparrow
The road is long, the path is narrow
--- ZACK ---
You're a Catholic; rules are not suggestions
--- KYRA ---
Read the Bible
--- IVY ---
Would you speak for God?
--- ALAN ---
Why can't you obey?
--- LUCAS ---
You've lost your way
--- STUDENTS ---
Scorned, reviled, waste of a child
--- ZACK ---
Time is ticking, graduation beckons
--- RORY ---
You have five months left to change your mind
--- STUDENTS ---
Lock those thoughts away, it's judgment day
Heaven severed, Hell is forever
Dig down deep and save your soul
Grave mistakes will take their toll
Every sin is entered in
Heaven comes with discipline
--- PETER ---
Doesn't it all make sense if the love is strong?
--- STUDENTS ---
No more dodging, God is watching
His eye is on the lowly sparrow
The road is long, the path is narrow
--- CLAIRE ---
Peter, honey, are you sleeping through mass again?
You know, if you keep this up, you're going straight to hell
--- PETER ---
Mom?
--- CLAIRE ---
Our first reading today is the story of how,
Despite the best efforts of a single mother
A child can still go horribly, horribly wrong
--- PETER ---
Mother, please!
--- CLAIRE ---
For his eighth birthday, Peter asked for an Easy Bake Oven
His father asked for a divorce
To me, the link between those two events was as strong
As Peter's attraction to my makeup table
--- PETER ---
Mom, this really isn't the best...
--- CLAIRE ---
I sent him to a Catholic boarding school thinking it would help
But, when he met his roommate Jason, the two of them locked eyes
And I said to myself, 'Claire, you wanted grandchildren?
Instead you're going to get ambiguous Christmas cards from South Beach'
--- DIANE ---
Please join us in singing our offertory hymn, number 273, 'A Bender Among Us'
--- STUDENTS ---
There's a bender among us, he must be exposed
Or he'll kidnap our children and take off their clothes
There's a bender among us, there's pink in our flock
A boy without conscience, whose led by his...
--- CLAIRE ---
...Cocktail: Peter's second favorite movie
His favorite: Top Gun
The signs were everywhere, we were practically tripping over them
--- PETER ---
Father?
--- PRIEST ---
Not in the funeral, Peter
--- Unknown ---
MATT?
I'd like to start with just a...
If we could take a moment...
If maybe we were silent...
Or we had spoken...
--- PETER ---
Mom? What is it?
Ivy? Nadia? Matt?
Is it I? Lord, is it I?
--- STUDENTS ---
Timothy, Romans, Corinthians, Leviticus
Timothy, Romans, Corinthians, Leviticus
Timothy, Romans, Corinthians, Leviticus
Hate the sinner, hate the sin, created in his image
Abomination, abomination, abomination, abomination
Bear/Bear the cross- Bear/Bear the cross- Bear/Bear the cross- Bear- Bear the cross!
Bear the cross! Bear the cross!
--- PRIEST ---
Let us go forth in peace to love and serve the Lord
--- STUDENTS ---
Praise be to God
--- PETER ---
Hail Mary full of grace...
