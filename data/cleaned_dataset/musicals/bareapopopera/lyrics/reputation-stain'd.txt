Matt and Jason - fight scene from the top
--- MATT ---
Romeo the love I bear thee can't afford
No better term than this, thou art a villain
--- JASON ---
Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee
Doth much excuse the appertaining rage to such a greeting
Villain I am none, farewell
I see thou knowst me not
--- PETER ---
Calm dishonorable, vile submission
--- JASON ---
Gentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up
--- Unknown ---
RORY (directing still)
Ivy, next scene - and Nadia
I checked and at no point does the nurse slap Juliet
--- IVY ---
Alack the day, he's gone, he's killed, he's dead
Can heaven be so envious? Hath Romeo slain himself?
--- Unknown ---
JASON (same time)
Courage, man, the hurt can't be too much (?)
--- Unknown ---
PETER (same time)
Why the devil came you between us?
I was slain under your arm
--- NADIA ---
Shame come to Romeo
--- IVY ---
Blistered be thy tongue for such a wish
--- Unknown ---
IVY / JASON
He was not born to shame / I thought for all the best
--- IVY ---
Oh what a beast was I to chide at him
--- NADIA ---
I just really think there's a slap there...
--- MATT ---
Thou, wretched boy, that did consort him here
Shalt with him hence!
--- Matt & Jason fight, Matt pushes Jason down ---
--- MATT ---
Faggot!
--- JASON ---
What the fuck did you call me?
--- MATT ---
You heard me!
--- shouting and fighting ---
--- SISTER CHANTELLE ---
Hey you two! Where do you think you are?
Public school? Matt, follow me...
--- PETER ---
What was that about?
--- JASON ---
I don't know...
--- PETER ---
Ok...well
Listen, I had the craziest dream or...vision last night!
I saw the virgin Mary and she was...[whispered]black!
And she had these...
Angels who were her backup singers and anyway...
She told that I needed to tell my mother about us, so
What are you doing for spring break?
--- JASON ---
Come on, we're gonna be late for class
--- PETER ---
Jason, stop, listen to me
--- JASON ---
What? You're kidding, right?
--- PETER ---
I need to tell her, I need for her to know
And I need you there when I do it
--- JASON ---
Ok...let's tell her!
So she can call my mom who'll immediately tell my dad
And they can all rush down here to conference with Father
Or maybe...maybe I just can call Notre Dame and ask them
for a leave of absence while I deal with a sexual identity crisis!
Or maybe...maybe my dad will just beat the shit out of me and disown me
Yeah, smart money says that's his first move...
Sure, let's tell her, when do we leave?
--- PETER ---
Jason, I can't deal with this anymore!
I have to talk about it...I almost told the priest in confession the other day
--- JASON ---
What? Are you out of your mind?
--- PETER ---
Jason this doesn't have to be such an...issue
Look, two months from now, we'll be out of here and this won't be a problem
--- JASON ---
No, no! Peter, this will always be a problem!
--- PETER ---
What are you saying?
--- JASON ---
This...us...whatever...it needs to stop
