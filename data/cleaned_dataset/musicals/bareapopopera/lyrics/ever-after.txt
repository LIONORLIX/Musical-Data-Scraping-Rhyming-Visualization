------ Ever After ------
--- PETER ---
You stand before me and I barely know you
Is it so easy to leave? Hmm?
Where is the boy who said I was his soul mate?
Where is the boy I believed?
--- Unknown ---
We climb and escape from those seeds that you planted
You slew all my giants, ignoring your own
Now that they haunt you
I'm left with my courage alone
--- Unknown ---
So much for our ever after?
I thought the good guys would triumph
I trusted a hero, I didn't hear his goodbye
I guess it was lost in the talk of a straight-acting coward
--- JASON ---
Who are you to go and blame this all on me?
You're the one who went ahead and changed the rules
--- Unknown ---
What!? You found your way and now it's all okay?
Is it that simple then? Really!?
--- PETER ---
You're such a fool!
--- JASON ---
It's time to wake up Peter, put away the fairytale
The clock is striking midnight, can't you hear?
Not all tales have happy endings, we can't keep pretending
'Cause there's no such thing as heroes that are queer
--- PETER ---
So much for our ever after?
You can't be the same boy I followed...thought I'd always follow
You've hurt me more than you know
All that I wanted was you, you were my tomorrow...
--- JASON ---
Peter...
Promise you won't say anything to anyone...
