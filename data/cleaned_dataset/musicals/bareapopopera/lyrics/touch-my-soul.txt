IVY [spoken]
Do you have a second?
--- Unknown ---
JASON [spoken]
Yeah, what's up?
--- Unknown ---
IVY [spoken]
It's just that I haven't seen you since...
I just thought that you would call me over the break.
I mean...it's fine that you didn't, but I just...
--- Unknown ---
JASON [spoken]
No, you're right, I should have called...
--- IVY ---
Things I have don't last for long
Boys have come and boys have gone
I've grown accustomed
I never really cared too much, don't get attached
Because I know them and what they're after
--- Unknown ---
I let them in, we make some noise
They let themselves out, that's their choice
Boys will be boys...
The phone won't ring and I become some anecdote
And though I've had my fun, it gets lonely
--- Unknown ---
But then came your kiss
And all I was missing was there in your eyes
Your lonely blue eyes
So please, say you'll stay
Say you'll never go away
My discarded heart has finally found a home
I know it's love... you touch my soul
--- Unknown ---
When I see you, I catch my breath;
Forget my sorrow
And I miss you before you've left
You are tomorrow
Here in your hands
I find a chance to make it through
To be somebody... stay with me
--- Unknown ---
I need your kiss
Cause all I was missing was there in your eyes
Your lonely blue eyes
So please take my hand
Let me help you understand
Two searching hearts can rest and be made whole
I know it's love... please let me touch your soul
Please let me touch your soul

JASON [spoken]
I...um...
--- Unknown ---
IVY [spoken]
You...? Listen... I know that it's early with us, but I wanted you to know how I feel, because I have never felt this way before...have you?
--- Unknown ---
JASON [spoken]
Yeah...Once.
[sung]
I think you're such a special girl
I really mean that
And I know in a perfect world
That I would love you
But what we have.. it doesn't work
It isn't you
I swear I promise...it's not about you...
--- IVY ---
What do you mean?
--- Unknown ---
JASON [spoken]
I...I made a mistake...I don't think we should see each other.
--- Unknown ---
IVY [spoken]
No...wait, can we just back up? I'm sorry, I shouldn't have--
--- JASON ---
Maybe someday...I wish to God I felt that way
You have touched my soul
You'll never know
