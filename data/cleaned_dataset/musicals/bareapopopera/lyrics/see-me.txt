CLAIRE [spoken]
Hello?
--- PETER ---
Mother I need to talk to you
--- Unknown ---
CLAIRE [spoken]
Peter! Honey, I was just gonna call you
--- PETER ---
There?s something that you need to know
--- Unknown ---
CLAIRE [spoken]
Gone a week, I miss you already
--- PETER ---
I?m just gonna spit it out
--- Unknown ---
CLAIRE [spoken]
How are rehearsals going?
--- PETER ---
You probably guessed it years ago
Still it?s kinda hard to say
--- Unknown ---
CLAIRE [spoken]
Peter, we?re so excited about the play
--- PETER ---
It?s something that I?ve spent so long not saying
--- Unknown ---
CLAIRE [spoken]
I called your father, he swore he?d be there
--- PETER ---
Sometimes it?s on the tip on my tongue
But only spoken aloud, alone
While I?m praying
--- Unknown ---
CLAIRE [spoken]
I?d like to tape it but honestly, Peter, I?m not gonna be one of those parents
--- PETER ---
All I ask is an open mind
--- Unknown ---
CLAIRE [spoken]
Peter, perhaps now isn?t the best time
--- PETER ---
It's such a lonely bridge to cross
--- Unknown ---
CLAIRE [spoken]
I?m taking Nanna to lunch
--- PETER ---
I search for answers on my own
--- Unknown ---
CLAIRE [spoken]
She?s so proud of you, Peter
--- PETER ---
And find that I?m completely lost,
[spoken]
Mom, please don?t say anything else, just listen ? I don?t know where to start
I can?t get the words out
It?s like they?re all jumbled together
Mom, I love you and?
--- CLAIRE ---
Berkley took their wait list
When they called I almost died
Would you really go to Berkley?
I didn?t know that you?d applied
--- Unknown ---
PETER [spoken]
Mom, please listen to me
--- CLAIRE ---
Where did Notre Dame go?
I didn?t know that you withdrew
People will be disappointed
Have you really thought this through?
--- PETER ---
Mom this is important
Mom you need to listen
Mom don?t shut me out here
Mom you need to see me
--- CLAIRE ---
Peter, please I?m so busy here
Let me call you later dear
--- PETER ---
God this is so hard to say
I'm so afraid you'll turn away
[spoken]
Mom, I?m?
--- CLAIRE ---
Peter, please, I need a break
Whatever it is will have to wait
I?m going to hang up now
I really need to hang up now
--- PETER ---
Don?t hang up this took such courage
I?m dying here, I?m all alone
I know you know you know what I?m saying
Just let me tell you ? Mom, I?m?
--- CLAIRE ---
Peter, please, I can?t solve all your problems
--- PETER ---
Mother you know nothing of them,
And I?m not expecting you to find solutions,
Just be my Mom and my friend
See me
--- Unknown ---
CLAIRE [spoken]
I assure you I?m in no state of mind to discuss anything right now
--- PETER ---
I?ve been waiting to tell you this since I was twelve
--- Unknown ---
CLAIRE [spoken]
Peter, I?m going to go now
--- PETER ---
You don?t want to hear it
You don?t want to see me
Can?t bare to see me
--- CLAIRE ---
Peter you tend to dramatize
--- PETER ---
There?s a reason for that mother
Open your eyes
--- CLAIRE ---
Peter, please, I have to go now
I really need to go right now
[spoken]
I?ll call you
--- PETER ---
When mom, when are you going to call?
--- Unknown ---
CLAIRE [spoken]
Soon, Peter, this week, this weekend
--- PETER ---
We can work this out together
--- Unknown ---
CLAIRE [spoken]
Maybe before then you?ll work whatever this is out
--- PETER ---
This is always on my mind
--- Unknown ---
CLAIRE [spoken]
I have so much on my mind
--- PETER ---
Please don?t hang up
--- Unknown ---
CLAIRE [spoken]
I have to go
--- PETER ---
