--- MATT ---
But soft! What light through
Yonder window breaks?
It is the East
And Juliet is the sun
Arise, fair sun, and kill
The envious moon
--- ZACK/ALAN ---
Who is already sick and pale
With grief

That thou her maid art far
More fair than she

Be not her maid
Since she is envious

And green

And none but fools
Do wear it

Cast it off
Cast it off

Straight tripping girl, I know
You did not just interrupt me
And what’s with the warble?
Snow white in the house
You’re quite a dancer
Too bad
You opened your mouth
I have a romeo who’s well rehearsed...
Then there’s the rest of you
This show has got to be cursed!
This play’s a tragedy
Without a doubt
Now, are there any other fools here
To make me fall out?
--- JASON ---
WIth love’s light wings did I
O’erperch these walls
For stony limits
Cannot hold love out
And what love can do
That dares love attempt

Attempt thy kinsman
Are no stop to me

If they do see thee they will murder me

In thine eye
Than twenty of their swords

And I am proof
Against their enemy

I have night’s cloack to hide me
From their eyes

My life were better ended
By their hate

Than death prorogued
Wanting of thy love
