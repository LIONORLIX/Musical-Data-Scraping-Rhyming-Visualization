Look how she lights up the sky
Ma belle Evangeline
So far above me yet I
Know her heart belongs to only me
--- Unknown ---
J'adore, J'taime, Evangeline
You're my queen of the night
So still, so bright
--- Unknown ---
To someone as beautiful as she
Who loves someone like me
Love always finds a way, it's true
And I love you Evangeline
Oooh, yeah!
--- Unknown ---
(sung)
Love is beautiful
Love is wonderful
Love is everything, do you agree?
Mais oui!
--- Unknown ---
Look how she lights up the sky
