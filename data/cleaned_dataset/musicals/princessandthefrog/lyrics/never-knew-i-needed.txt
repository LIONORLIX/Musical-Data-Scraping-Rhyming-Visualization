------ Never Knew I Needed ------
--- Unknown ---
For the way you changed my plans
For being the perfect distraction
For the way you took the idea that I have
Of everything that I wanted to have
And made me see there was something missing, oh yeah
--- Unknown ---
For the ending of my first begin
And for the rare and unexpected friend
For the way you're something that I'd never choose
But at the same time, something I don't wanna lose
And never wanna be without ever again
--- Unknown ---
You're the best thing I never knew I needed
So when you were here I had no idea
You the best thing I never knew I needed
So now it's so clear, I need you here always
--- Unknown ---
My accidental happily
The way you smile and how you comfort me
I must admit you were not a part of my book
But now if you open it up and take a look
You're the beginning and the end of every chapter
--- Unknown ---
You're the best thing I never knew I needed
So when you were here I had no idea
You the best thing I never knew I needed
So now it's so clear, I need you here always
--- Unknown ---
Who knew that I could be
So unexpectedly
Undeniably happier
Sitting with you right here, right here next to me
Girl, you're the best
--- Unknown ---
You're the best thing I never knew I needed
So when you were here I had no idea
You're the best thing I never knew I needed
So now it's so clear I need you here always
