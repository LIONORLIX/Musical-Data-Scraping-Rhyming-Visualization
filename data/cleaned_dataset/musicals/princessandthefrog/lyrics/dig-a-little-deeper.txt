------ Dig A Little Deeper ------
--- Unknown ---
Mama Odie: Don't matter what you wear
How many rings you got on your finger
We don't care
Choir: (No we don't care)
--- Unknown ---
Don't matter where you come from
Don't even matter what you are
A dog, a pig, a cow, a goat
Had 'em all in here (we had 'em all in here)
--- Unknown ---
And they all knew what they wanted
What they wanted me to do
I told 'em what they needed
Just like I be telling you
--- Unknown ---
You got to dig a little deeper
Find out who you are
You got to dig a little deeper
It really ain't that far
--- Unknown ---
When you find out who you are
You'll find out what you need
Blue skies and sunshine guaranteed
You got to dig (dig)
You got to dig (dig)
--- Unknown ---
Prince Froggy is a rich little boy
You wanna be rich again
That ain't gonna make you happy now
Did it make you happy then? No!
Money ain't got no soul
Money ain't got no heart
All you need is some self-control
Make yourself a brand new start
--- Unknown ---
You got to dig a little deeper
Don't have far to go
You got to dig a little deeper
Tell the people Mama told you so
--- Unknown ---
Can't tell you what you'll find
Maybe love will grant you peace of mind
Dig a little deeper and you'll know
--- Unknown ---
Miss Froggy, might I have a word?
You's a hard one, that's what I heard
Your daddy was a loving man
Family through and through
You your daddy's daughter
What he had in him you got in you
--- Unknown ---
You got to dig a little deeper
For you it's gonna be tough
You got to dig a little deeper
You ain't dug near far enough
--- Unknown ---
Dig down deep inside yourself
You'll find out what you need
Blue skies and sunshine guaranteed
Open up the windows
Let in the light children
--- Unknown ---
Tiana: Blue skies and sunshine
Mama Odie: Guaranteed
