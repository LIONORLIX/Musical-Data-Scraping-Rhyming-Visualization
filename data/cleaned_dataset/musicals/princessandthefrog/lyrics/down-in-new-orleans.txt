------ Down In New Orleans ------
--- Unknown ---
In the South Land there's a city
Way down on the river
Where the women are very pretty
And all the men deliver
--- Unknown ---
They got music
It's always playin'
Start in the day time, go all through the night
--- Unknown ---
When you hear that music playin'
Hear what I'm saying, it make you feel alright
--- Unknown ---
Grab somebody, come on down
Bring your paintbrush, we're paintin' the town
Oh there's some sweetness goin' 'round
Catch it down in New Orleans
--- Unknown ---
We got magic, good and bad
Make you happy or make you real sad
Get everything you want, lose what you had
Down here in New Orleans
--- Unknown ---
Hey partner, don't be shy
Come on down here and give us a try
You wanna do some livin' before you die
Do it down in New Orleans
--- Unknown ---
Stately homes and mansions
Of the Sugar Barons and the Cotton Kings
Rich people, old people, all got dreams
