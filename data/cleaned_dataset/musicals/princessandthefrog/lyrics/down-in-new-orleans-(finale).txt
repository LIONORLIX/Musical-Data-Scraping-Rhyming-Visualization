------ Down In New Orleans (Finale) ------
--- Unknown ---
In the South Land there's a city
Way down on the river
Where the women are very pretty
And all the men deliver
--- Unknown ---
They got music
It's always playin'
Start in the day time, go all through the night
--- Unknown ---
When you hear that music playin'
Hear what I'm saying and make it feel alright
--- Unknown ---
Grab somebody, come on down
Bring your paintbrush, we're painting the town
There's some sweetness going around
