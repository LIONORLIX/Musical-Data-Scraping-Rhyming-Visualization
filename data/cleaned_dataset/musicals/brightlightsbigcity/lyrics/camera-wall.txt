People, this is Chuck Bean
On the scene at Rocafellar Center
For the MTV extravaganza starring
Amanda, the hot new thing
There?s Versace with Oscar De La Renta
For Simon de BonBon and Duran Duran Duran
Hey, are you hungry like the wolf?
This is Chuck Bean on the scene
Where fashion and music meet
Where the word on the street is
You better look good if you wanna go far
Cause today?s supermodel is the new superstar
Aw, yeah, here come the ladies
--- Models ---
Walk toward the camera wall
Supermodel is the best job in the world
Walk toward the camera?s call
Don?t know how I got into that, oh no no
Didn?t want to get into that, oh oh oh
--- Tad ---
Jamie, Amanda?s right over there
--- Jamie ---
Where?
--- Amanda ---
Sitting in my dressing room
Staring in the mirror at I don?t know who
So many different of me
Appearing, disappearing
Who are they?
I can be a vixen, I can be a vamp
A princess or a junkie, virgin or a tramp
Bend me, shape me, anyway you want me
Image me up and the camera will tell you
Who I am
--- Models ---
Walk toward the camera wall
Walk toward the camera wall
--- Amanda ---
Swinging to the rhythm of a beat that I don?t recognize
Inside I?m a mess
I?m higher than a kite
Please tell me, is it day or night?
And, God, I hate this dress
Lip gloss, weight loss
Face lift, nose job
Silicone, novacaine, plastic features
Plastic beauty, plastic me
Look and see and the camera will tell you
Who I am
Here I am
--- Models ---
Walk toward the camera wall
Supermodel is the best job in the world
Watch us go into super slow-mo
--- Jamie ---
Amanda!
--- Tad ---
Jamie, what are you doing?
--- Jamie ---
Amanda!
--- Tad ---
Jamie, Jamie!
--- Jamie ---
Look at me!
--- Tad ---
Jamie, for God?s sake, man!
--- Jamie ---
Amanda, look at me!
Remember me, your husband?
--- Tad ---
What the fuck is?Jamie!
--- Jamie ---
Remember me?
Jamie?
--- Models (repeated) ---
Walk toward the camera wall
--- Chuck Bean ---
This is Chuck Bean on the scene of a sensation
There?s an eruption in the crowd
The coked-out husband stalking Amanda
--- Jamie ---
Don?t worry about me
I?m doing fine
I could write a book
I might draw the line
Could-a, would-a, should-a
Yes, well all know that one, don?t we?
It?s the psycho killer look
It?s the fact that I mistook myself for someone else
--- Chuck Bean ---
This is Chuck Bean on the scene
Deep inside Jamie?s head
Where did he go wrong?
How did it come to this?
--- Jamie ---
The voice is getting louder
More valerian, marching power
--- Chuck Bean ---
What?s wrong with people in love?
--- Jamie ---
If I lie down, I might die
If I lie down, I might die
Don?t worry about me
I?m doing fine
I don?t need you, brother
I don?t need you, mother
I don?t need this job
I don?t need this wife
I don?t need, I don?t need
I don?t need, I don?t need
Don?t worry about me
I?m doing fine
I could write a book
I might draw the line
Could-a, would-a, should-a
Yes, we all know that one, don?t we?
It?s that psycho killer look
It?s the fact that I mistook myself for someone else
