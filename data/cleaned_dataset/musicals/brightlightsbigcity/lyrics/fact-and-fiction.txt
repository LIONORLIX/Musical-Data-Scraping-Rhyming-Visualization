------ Fact and Fiction ------
--- Secretary ---
Gotham Magazine,
Department of Factual Verification
--- Clara ---
You?re terminally unpunctual
--- Ensemble ---
Fact!
--- Clara ---
Your work is quite dysfunctional
--- Ensemble ---
Fact!
--- Clara ---
I?ve had as much as I can take
--- Jamie ---
I?m just a boy in the city, Clara
Give a boy a break
--- Clara ---
Oh, no no no no,
I don?t think so Jamie
You can?t be a dreamer in an office that deals in fact
Not fiction, I?m talking, baby, fact
Not contradiction
I spoke with Mr. Depardieu
--- Ensemble ---
Fact!
--- Clara ---
And we?re moving the French piece
Up an issue
--- Ensemble ---
Fact!
--- Clara ---
I need it on my desk
Tomorrow at nine
--- Ensemble ---
Fact!
--- Clara ---
Can you handle it Jamie?
--- Jamie ---
I can handle it, Clara
--- Secretary ---
Fiction!
--- Jamie ---
It isn?t that compelling checking
Other people?s spelling
Grammar isn?t glamorous,
Dictionaries either
I wish I was in fiction
I?m so tired of waiting
Wondering where along the line
I simply stopped exhilarating
I remember coming here the first time for my interview
I thought of all the names that had been made here
I expected to leave fact and go upstairs to fiction
The inevitability of it all was so convincing
Please, sir, could you read my writing?
Open invitation,
Criticize, construction
Here?s an introduction to who I am
And who I want to be
--- Secretary ---
Jamie, line two, Monsieur Depardieu
He demands to speak to vous
