My son
--- Jamie ---
Your son?
--- Clara ---
Dylan?s 13 now
My son lives with his dad
My son, he has a good life, big fun
In his Michigan home
I wasn?t a good wife
But still, I miss him today and tomorrow
And I always will
My son
When he left, I was crazy, way gone
Bellevue depressed, no one could break through my darkness
No one, not even my son
I?ve a chemical imbalance they say
Four lithium carbonate tablets a day and I?m swell
Like hell!
Don?t tell my son
--- Jamie ---
I presume I?m fired?
--- Clara ---
Effective immediately
