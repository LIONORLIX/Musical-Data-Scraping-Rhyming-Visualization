Brother, calling my brother
What the hell?s going on with you?
I?ve been calling for a week now
How?s your wife, man?
How?s you job?
How?s your life?
Why don?t you call me, brother?
Next week is the anniversary
Of our mother dying, brother
I?ve been trying to get a hold of you
Just to let you know
We?re going to spread her ashes
On the lake
But not without you, brother
Calling my brother
Where are you, brother?
If you see my brother
Could you ask him please to call me?
That he owes it to our mother
That I?m waiting in Box County
If the mountain will not come to me
Then I?ll come to Manhattan
Could you tell him that, please?
Could you tell my brother?
Calling my brother
And where?s Amanda?
--- Amanda ---
I won?t be coming home tonight
--- Jamie ---
Did you get a later flight?
--- Amanda ---
I?m staying in Paris
--- Jamie ---
For how long?
Amanda:
I?m sorry
I don?t want to hurt you
One day I?ll explain
--- Jamie ---
What are you saying?
--- Amanda ---
My career is really taking off here
--- Jamie ---
Since when is modeling a fucking career?
--- Amanda ---
Jamie, please
--- Jamie ---
Is there someone else?
--- Amanda ---
Well, that?s not the point
But?yes
--- Jamie ---
Who?
--- Amanda ---
A photographer from Paris
--- Jamie ---
You said they were all gay
--- Amanda ---
