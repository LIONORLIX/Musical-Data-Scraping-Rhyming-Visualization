------ Bright Lights, Big City ------
--- Tad ---
Are we ready to roll?
--- Ensemble ---
Where are we rolling?
--- Tad ---
Into the heart of the night!
--- Jamie ---
I am not the kind of guy
Who should be in a place like this
At this time of the morning
Sunday morning, 6 A.M.
I should?ve cut my losses at 3 A.M.
But I said, ?No, I need more blow
To get me on my marching feet again.?
Look at the darkness shine
Right into mine
Bright lights, big city
Bright lights, big city
Now, this is what you wanted
All the frolic and the frenzy
Plenty of illusion here,
You live it every day
Know what you see is not what you get here
Dirty, pretty New York City
Hang on to each rush
Before it up and blows away
Look at the darkness come
Hard like a drum
--- Jamie and Chorus ---
Bright lights, big city
Bright lights, big city
--- Coke Girl ---
Yeah, yeah, yeah
--- Jamie ---
The problem is
I?m the kinda guy who?s lookin? for the kinda girl
Who?d never be here
In a club like this at this time of the morning
--- Jamie and Chorus ---
Sunday morning, 6 A.M.
--- Jamie ---
I?m lookin? for the kinda girl
Who I?d call at eleven
For some croissants and a coffee
Then we?d go to
--- Jamie and Chorus ---
Some museum
And a set or two of tennis
With Elizabeth and Dennis
Who have just got back from Venice
Oh, I?m a menace to myself
Dancing this close to heartbreak
--- Jamie ---
Falling away
--- Coke Girl ---
You got any blow?
--- Jamie ---
Is Stevie Wonder blind?
--- Coke Girl ---
I wouldn?t mind some
--- Jamie ---
Just a little taste
The soups on, as it were
--- Coke Girl ---
Sure
--- Jamie ---
Step into my office
--- Coke Girl ---
I love drugs
And everything they do
Don?t you?
--- Jamie ---
I do
--- Both ---
Love drugs
I love drugs
--- Coke Girl ---
You got anymore?
--- Jamie ---
You cleaned out the store.
--- Coke Girl ---
Goodbye
--- Jamie ---
