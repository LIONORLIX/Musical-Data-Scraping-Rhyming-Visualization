------ Brother, Pt. 2 ------
--- Michael ---
Brother, calling my brother
--- Jamie ---
Michael, what are you doing here?
--- Michael ---
What the hell?s going on with you?
I?ve been calling for a week now
--- Jamie ---
Yeah, I know
--- Michael ---
And, so?
--- Jamie ---
And, so?
--- Michael ---
So, why don?t you call me back?
I don?t get it
This week is the anniversary
Of our mother dying, brother
I?ve been trying to get you
Just to let you know?
--- Jamie ---
You?re going to spread her ashes on the lake
--- Michael ---
But not without you
Brother, calling my brother
Face it, Jamie, face it now
It?s been tough on all of us
Deal with it somehow, be a man
You can do that, can?t you, brother?
--- Jamie ---
I gotta go
--- Michael ---
No, you?re not going anywhere
--- Jamie ---
Look, don?t be an asshole, Michael
--- Michael ---
Hey, Mr. Wonderful,
Who galloped in from New York
For the last act of Mom?s life?
With your stupid rented sports car and your stupid model wife!
--- Jamie ---
Shut up!
--- Michael ---
Like it was some New York party you didn?t mind being late for!
--- Jamie ---
Shut up!
--- Michael ---
You never had to exert yourself for anything
School, girls, awards, fancy jobs,
They all just fell in your lap!
--- Jamie ---
Shut the fuck up!
--- Michael ---
