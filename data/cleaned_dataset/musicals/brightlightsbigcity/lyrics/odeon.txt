Odeon, Odeon

I know I should be working
But instead I?m busy shirking
All the drudgery and drivel of responsibility
Both eyes peeled for lonely girls
I don?t think I?m seeing any nuns
Who?d be interested in coming home with me
--- Tad ---
Cherche le gram, man
Cherche  le gram
My connection let me down
He had to leave town
Real quick, big hurry
I?ll score, don?t worry
--- Girl #1 ---
Hey, aren?t you Amanda White?s ex-husband?
She was yummy, for a while I used to stop?
--- Jamie ---
No, no we?re not
--- Girl #1 ---
Sorry, she was hot
--- Theresa ---
Well son, we?d like to get to Bolivia right away
--- Jamie ---
I speak your lingo
--- Tad ---
Bingo!
Let?s go everybody
It?s snowing in the bathroom
--- Jamie ---
Ha! That didn?t take long
--- Ensemble ---
Nice rush, cool fuck
Mind fuck, electronics
Gin and tonics, Reaganomics
Gimme more celebrities
Calvin Klein, Mary Booth
Bastian, hooking up
Christie Brinkley, I?ve been busted
Steve Ruble and Jackie O

Seems like I?ve spent half my life in bathrooms lately

Odeon
--- Theresa ---
I know what you mean
--- Tad ---
Oh so neat
Bon appetite
So, are we ready to roll?
--- Jamie and Ensemble ---
Where are we rolling?
--- Tad ---
Into the heart of the night!
All over the city tonight
A million nightclubs crave our cash
And past infinity desires, regimes, Savoy
Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy
I?m talking female confection
I?m talking something soft and sweet
I?m talking electricity, femininity
It?s better than drugs
--- Tad and Ensemble ---
The libido tugs, the magnet chars
Animal lust because because
Man made woman, woman made man
It?s obvious, it?s obvious
I wanna have sex tonight
I wanna have sex tonight
Come on!
Come on!
--- Girl #2 ---

--- Girl #3 ---

Knocks and knockers
Cocks and cockers
Elevation, midnight blue
--- Theresa ---
Would you be less quiet if you have the chance?
--- All ---
I cordially invite you to bite it
Ride it, slip it, slide it
Gloss and glide it, light me up
Make me forget my whole life sucks
And a million fucks won?t make that right
But, yeah, I wanna have sex tonight
I wanna have sex tonight
Come on!
Come on!
--- Pot Girl ---
Got any smoke?
--- Jamie ---
Can Bob Hope tell a joke?
--- Pot Girl ---
Bob who?
--- Jamie ---
I?ll get something for you
--- Pot Girl ---
Hurry up, my mother?s gonna kill me
--- Jamie ---
Your mother?
--- Pot Girl ---
Come on!
