------ Sunday Morning 6 A.M. ------
--- Ensemble ---
It?s way after dark
A new day is dawning
Sunday morning heartbreak
--- Jamie ---
I?m heady and light
Flimsy as silk
Battered and bruised
As this carton of milk
--- Mary O?Brien McCann ---
Jamie,
I am Mary O?Brien McCann
I?m a student at NYU
I am missing
I was last seen in Washington Square
Wearing a sweater and blouse
I am missing
Please, could you find me?
Please don?t go
Please, could you find me?
Please don?t go
Don?t go
--- Both ---
Don?t go
--- Jamie ---
Don?t go
--- Amanda ---
Jamie
--- Jamie ---
Amanda?
--- Amanda ---
Tonight, tonight let?s go to Old EI
I read about it on a New York Magazine
We?ll spend the day together in
The bubble-maker, sugar sweet trouble
--- Jamie ---
Amanda
--- Amanda ---
Take a walk around the block
--- Jamie ---
Amanda
--- Amanda ---
Pick up some supplies
Hey, husband, buy your Sunday Times
And come home soon
Don?t forget to go to Zito?s
The smell of fresh beaked bread turns me on
Isn?t this a beautiful Sunday?
Isn?t this a beautiful Sunday?
--- Jamie ---
Amanda, I can see that Sunday now
Amanda, my typer was hyper all day that day
And later that night the words fell from the sky
And I plucked them off the rooftops from Manhattan
And I wrote them down for you and I
How long has it been since you left me, Amanda?
--- Amanda ---
Three months, maybe four
I don?t count anymore
--- Jamie ---
I don?t count anymore
--- Both ---
Wasn?t that a beautiful Sunday?
Wasn?t that a beautiful Sunday?
--- Amanda ---
In our darling little hovel
--- Jamie ---
Before you became a model
--- Amanda ---
Before you threw away your novel
--- Jamie ---
The Great American Novel
--- Amanda ---
At the end of Chapter Four
--- Jamie ---
My typer isn?t hyper anymore
--- Statue of Liberty ---
You are not the kind of boy
Who should be coming home
At this time of the morning
Heartbreak, Sunday Morning, 6 A.M.
All messed up, no place to go
So, tell me, what would mother say?
So say, pray, what would brother say?
I think it?s time you face the fact
Your wife has run away
Come let the darkness rise
Open your eyes
Bright lights, big city
