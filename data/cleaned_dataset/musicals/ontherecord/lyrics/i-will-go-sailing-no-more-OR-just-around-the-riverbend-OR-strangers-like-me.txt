------ I Will Go Sailing No More / Just Around the Riverbend / Strangers Like Me ------
--- Unknown ---
Julian: Out among the stars I sailed,
Way beyond the moon.
In my silver ship I sailed,
In a dream that ended too soon.
Now I know exactly who I am,
What I'm here for.
And I will go sailin' no more...
Kristen: What I like most about rivers is
You can't step in the same river twice.
The water's always changing, always flowing.
But people I guess can't live like that,
We all must pay a price.
To be safe we lose our chance of ever knowing
Kristen + Women: What's around the river bend,
Waiting just around the river bend.
All: I look once more (Just around the river bend).
Beyond the shore (Where the gulls fly free).
Don't know what for,
What I dream the day might send
Just around the river bend for me.
Nick: Oh I can see there's so much to learn,
Nick + Kristen: It's all so close and yet so far.
Beyond the trees above the clouds,
Oh I just know there's something bigger
out there.
All: I wanna know!
Can you show me?
I wanna know 'bout these strangers like me.
Tell me more!
Please show me!
Something's familiar 'bout these strangers like me...
All: Come with me now to see my world,
Where there's beauty beyond your dreams.
Can you feel the things I feel right now,
With you?
Take my hand, there's a world I need to know
