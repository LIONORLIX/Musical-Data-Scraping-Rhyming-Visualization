------ Colors of the Wind ------
--- DIANE ---
You think the only people who are people
Are the people who look and think like you
But if you walk the footsteps of a stranger,
You'll learn things you never knew you never knew
Have you ever heard the wolf cry to the blue corn moon?
Or let the eagle tell you where he's been?
We need to sing with all the voices of the mountain
We need to paint with all the Colors of the Wind
You can own the earth and still
All you'll own is Earth until
You can paint with all the Colors of the Wind
