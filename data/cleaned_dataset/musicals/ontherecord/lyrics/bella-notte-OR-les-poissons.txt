------ Bella Notte / Les Poissons ------
--- Unknown ---
This is the night
It's a beautiful night
and we call it Bella Notte.
Look at the skies,
they have stars in their eyes
on this lovely Bella Notte.
Side by side, with your loved one,
you'll find enchantment here.
The night will weave its magic spell
when the one you love is near,
for this is the night,
when the heavens are right,
on this lovely Bella Notte.
Les poissons, les poissons,
how I love les poissons!
Love to chop and to serve little fish!
First I cut off their heads,
then I pull out their bones!
Ah! Me oui! Sauce toujour delish!
Les poissons, les poissons,
hee hee hee! Haw haw haw!
With a cleaver I hack them in two!
I pull out what's inside,
and I serve it up fried
Ooh, I love little fishes, don't you?
