------ Baby Mine ------
--- Unknown ---
Baby mine don't you cry
Baby mine dry your eyes
Rest your head close to my heart
Never to part
Baby of mine
--- Unknown ---
Little one when you play
Don't you mind what they say
Let those eyes sparkle and shine
Never a tear
Baby of mine
--- Unknown ---
If they knew sweet little you
They'd end up loving you too
All those same people who scold you
What they'd give just for the right to hold you
--- Unknown ---
From your head down to your toes
You're not much goodness knows
you're so precious to me
sweet as can be
Baby of mine
--- Unknown ---
All of those people who scold you
What they'd give just for the right to hold you
--- Unknown ---
From your head down to your toes
You're not much goodness knows
But your so precious to me
Sweet as can be
Baby of mine
