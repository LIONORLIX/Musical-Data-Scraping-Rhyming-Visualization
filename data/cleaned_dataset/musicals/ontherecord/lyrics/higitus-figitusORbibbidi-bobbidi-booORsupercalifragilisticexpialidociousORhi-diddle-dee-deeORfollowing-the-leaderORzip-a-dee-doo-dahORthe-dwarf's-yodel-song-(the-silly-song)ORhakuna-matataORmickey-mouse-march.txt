If you're chased around by trouble,
and you're followed by a jinx,
I'll jinx your trouble and trouble your jinx
In less than forty winks.
Whe your mind is in a dither, and your heart is in a haze,
I'll haze your dither and dither your haze...
with a magic phrase.
It's supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.
Even though the sound of it is something quite atrocious.
If you say it loud enough, you'll always sound precocious.
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.
Um-diddle-iddle-iddle-um-diddle-i
Um-diddle-iddle-iddle-um-diddle-i
because I was afraid to speak when I was just a lad,
my father gave my nose a tweak and told me I was bad!
But then one day I learned a word that saved my achin' nose.
The biggest word you ever heard, and this is how it goes!
Oh, supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.
Even though the sound of it is something quite atrocious.
If you say it loud enough, you'll always sound precocious.
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.
