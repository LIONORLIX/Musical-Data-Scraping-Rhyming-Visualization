------ Reflection ------
--- Unknown ---
look at me
i will never pass for a perfect bride, or a perfect daughter
can it be im not ment to play this part
now i see that if i were truely to be myself
i would break my familys heart
--- Unknown ---
Who is that girl I see
staring straight back at me?
Why is my reflection someone i dont know
some how i can not hide
who i am, though i've tried
when will my reflection show who i am inside
