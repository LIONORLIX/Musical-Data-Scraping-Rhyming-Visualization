------ Under the Sea ------
--- Unknown ---
The seaweed is always greener
In somebody else's lake
--- Unknown ---
You dream about going up there
But that is a big mistake
--- Unknown ---
Just look at the world around you
Right here on the ocean floor
--- Unknown ---
Such wonderful things surround you
What more are you looking for
--- Unknown ---
Under the sea, under the sea
Darlin' it's better
Down where it's wetter,
Take it from me
--- Unknown ---
Up on the shore they work all day
Out in the sun they slave away
--- Unknown ---
While we devotin?
Full time to floatin?
Under the sea
--- Unknown ---
Down here all the fish are happy
As off through the waves day roll
--- Unknown ---
The fish on the land ain't happy
They're sad 'cause they're in a bowl
--- Unknown ---
But fish in the bowl is lucky
They're in for a worser fate
--- Unknown ---
One day when the boss gets hungry
Guess whos goin' be on the plate(uh-oh)
--- Unknown ---
Under the sea, under the sea
Nobody beats us
Fry us and eat us in fricasee
--- Unknown ---
We what the land folks love to cook
Under the sea we off the hook
--- Unknown ---
We got no troubles life is the bubbles
--- Unknown ---
Under the sea, under the sea
Since life is sweet here
We got the beat here naturally
--- Unknown ---
Even the strugeon an' the ray
They get the urge an' start to play
--- Unknown ---
We got the spirit
You got to hear it under the sea
--- Unknown ---
The newt play the flute
The carp play the harp
The plaice play the bass
And they're soundin sharp.
The bass play the brass
The chub play the tub
The fluke is the duke of soul
--- Unknown ---
They ray he can play
He lings on the strings
He trout rockin' out
The blackfish she sings
The smelt and the sprat
They know where it's at
An' Oh. That blowfish blow
--- Unknown ---
Under the sea(under the sea)
Under the sea(under the sea)
--- Unknown ---
When the sardine
Begin the beguine it's music to me
--- Unknown ---
What do they got, a lot of sand
We got a hot crustacean band
--- Unknown ---
Each little clam here
Know how to jam here under the sea
--- Unknown ---
Each little slug here
Cutin' a rug here under the sea
--- Unknown ---
Each little snail here
Know how to wail here
That's why it's hotter under the water
Ya' we in luck here
