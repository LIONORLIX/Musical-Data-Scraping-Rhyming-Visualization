------ He's a Tramp ------
--- Unknown ---
What a dog!
What a dog!
--- Unknown ---
He's a tramp
But I love him
Breaks a new heart every day
--- Unknown ---
He's a tramp
They adore him
And I only hope he'll stay that way
--- Unknown ---
He's a tramp
He's a scoundrel
He's a rounder
He's a cad
He's a tramp
But I love him
Yes, and even I have got it pretty bad
--- Unknown ---
You can never tell when he'll show up
He gives you plenty of trouble
I guess he's just a no-'count pup
But I wish that he were double
--- Unknown ---
He's a tramp
He's a rover
And there's nothing more to say
If he's a tramp he's a good one
And I wish that I could travel his way
Wish that I could travel his way
