------ Someday My Prince Will Come / Once Upon a Dream ------
--- Unknown ---
Someday my prince will come,
someday I'll find my love.
And how thrilling that moment will be
when the prince of my dreams comes to me.
He'll whisper, I love you,
and steal a kiss or two.
Though he's far away, I'll find my love someday,
Someday when my dreams come true.
Someday my prince will come,
someday I'll find my love.
And how thrilling that moment will be
when the prince of my dreams comes to me.
I know you, I walked with you once upon a dream.
I know you, the gleam in your eyes is so familiar a gleam.
Yet I know it's true that visions are seldom all they seem
But if I know you, I know what you'll do,
You'll love me at once
the way you did once upon a dream.
He'll whisper, I love you, and steal a kiss or two
But if I know you, I know what you'll do!
You'll love me at once, the way you did once
