------ Ev'rybody Wants to Be a Cat / The Siamese Cat Song / The Tiki Tiki Tiki Room ------
--- Unknown ---
Because a cat's the only cat who knows where it's at
Everbody's picking up on that bee lined bees
'Cause everything else is obsolete
Now squell with the horn makes you wish you weren't born
Every time you place
With the square in the act you could send music back
To the caveman days
I've heard some chronic birds who drive insane
But the cat's the only cat who knows how to swim
Who wants to take along and give us stuff like that
But ev'rybody wants to be a cat
Come on cool cats let's swim
Bobby pick up that axe and do something
Ev'rybody wants to be a cat
'Cause a cat's the only cat who knows where it's at
Everybody's picking up on that feelin'
'Cause everything else is out to leave
Now squell with the horn makes you wish you weren't born
Every time you place
With the square in the act you could send music back
To the caveman days
Ev'rybody wants to be a cat
Because a cat's the only cat who knows where it's at
Playing jazz you always ever will come back
'Cause everybody digs a swinging cat, everybody digs a swinging cat
Ev'rybody loves a swinging cat, everybody digs a swaying cat
Because a cat's the only cat who knows where it's at
