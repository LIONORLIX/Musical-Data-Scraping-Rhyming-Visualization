------ I Just Can't Wait to Be King / Lavender Blue ------
--- Unknown ---
Everybody look left, everybody look right,
everywhere you look I'm standing in the spotlight!
Let every creature go for broke and sing,
Oh I just can't wait to be king!
Oobee doo! I wanna be like you-oo-oo! Oobee doo!
Oh I just can't wait to be king!
Lavender blue, dilly dilly.
Lavender green.
If you were king, dilly dilly,
you'd need a queen in a dilly dilly dress of
Lavender blue (oop de wee) dilly dilly
Lavender green (oop de wee)
You'll be a king, dilly dilly.
I'll be your queen. Oop de wee! Oop de wee!
Dilly dilly Ah be doo bee doo wah!
No one sayin' do this! (ooh ooh ah!)
No one sayin' be there! (ooh ooh ah!)
No one sayin' stop that! (ooh ooh ah!)
No one sayin' see here! (ooh ooh ah!)
Let every creature go for broke and sing!
Let's hear it in the herd and on the wing!
It's gonna be King Simba's finest fling!
