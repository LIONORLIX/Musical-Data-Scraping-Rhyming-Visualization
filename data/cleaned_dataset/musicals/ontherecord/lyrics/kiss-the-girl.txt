There you see her
Sitting there across the way
She don't got a lot to say,
But there's something about her.
And you don't know why,
But you're dying to try
You wanna,
Kiss the girl
Yes, you want her
Look at her you know you do
Possible she wants you too,
there is one way to ask her.
It don't take a word,
Not a single word, go on and
Kiss the Girl (sing wit' me now)
--- Frogs & Sebastien ---
Sha la la la la la
My oh my
Look like the boy too shy
He ain't gonna kiss the girl
Sha la la la la la
Ain't that sad
Ain't it a shame, too bad
You're gonna miss the girl,

Now's your moment
Floating in a blue lagoon
Boy you better do it soon
No time will be better
She don't say a word
And she won't say a word until you, kiss the girl
--- Unknown ---
Sha la la la la la
Don't be scared
You've got the mood prepared
Go on and kiss the girl
Sha la la la la la
Don't stop now
Don't try to hide it how, you wanna
Kiss the girl (woah-woah!)
Sha la la la la la
Float along, and listen to the song
The song say, kiss the girl
Sha la la la la
The music play
Do what the music says
You gotta, kiss the girl
