------ Will the Sun Ever Shine Again ------
--- Unknown ---
Rain is pourin' down like the
heavens are hurtin'.
Seems like it's been dark since
the devil knows when.
How do you go on, never knowin'
for certain,
Will the sun ever shine again?
--- Unknown ---
Fells like it's been years since
it started to thunder.
Clouds are campin' out in the valley
and glen.
How do you go on, when you can't help
but wonder.
Will the sun ever shine again?
--- Unknown ---
What if the rain keeps fallin'?
What if the sky stays gray?
What if the wind keeps squallin',
And never go away?
--- Unknown ---
Maybe the soon the storm will be
tired of blowin'.
Maybe soon it all will be over, amen.
How do you go on, if there's no way
of knowin'?
Will the sun ever shine?
Wish I could say.
Send me a sign-
One little ray.
Lord, if you're list'nin', how long
until then?
