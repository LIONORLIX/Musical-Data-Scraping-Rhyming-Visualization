------ Minnie's Yoo-Hoo ------
--- Unknown ---
(Verse 1)
I'm the guy they call little Mickey Mouse
Got a sweetie down in the chicken house
Neither fat nor skinny
She's the horse's whinny
She's my little Minnie Mouse!
When it's feedin' time for the animals
And they howl and growl like the cannibals
I just turn my heel to the henhouse steal
And you'll hear me sing this song
--- Unknown ---
(Chorus)
Oh, the old tomcat with the meow, meow, meow!
Ol' hound dog with the bow-wow-wow!
The crow's caw-caw!
And the mule's hee-haw!
Gosh what a racket like an ol' buzz saw!
I have listened to the cuckoo cuke his coo-coo!
And I've heard the rooster cock his doodle doo-oo
With the cows and the chickens
They all sound like the dickens when I hear my little Minnie's Yoo-Hoo!
--- Unknown ---
(Verse 2)
Oh the blue bird down in the cherry tree
And the busy buzz of the bumblebee
Evening bells a-ringin'
Whip-poor-wills a-singin'
Well they don't mean much to me!
For my heart is down in the chicken house
Where I long to be with my Minnie Mouse
And I'll meet her there
Mid that fragrance rare,
