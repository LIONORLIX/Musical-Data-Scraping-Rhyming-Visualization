------ Something There / Beauty and the Beast ------
--- Unknown ---
There's something sweet, and almost kind.
But he was mean and he was coarse and unrefined.
And now he's dear, and so unsure.
I wonder why we didn't see it there before.
Tale as old as time,
Perhaps there's something there that wasn't there before.
tune as old as song.
There may be something there that wasn't there before.
Barely even friends, then somebody bends unexpectedly.
Just a little change.
Small, to say the least.
