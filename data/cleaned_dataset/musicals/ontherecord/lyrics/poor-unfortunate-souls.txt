------ Poor Unfortunate Souls ------
--- Ursula ---
The only way to get what you want...
...is to become a human yourself!
--- Ariel ---
(Gasps with excitement) Can you do that?
--- Ursula ---
My dear, sweet child,
That's what I do...
It's what I live for...
To help unfortunate merfolk,
Like yourself...
Poor souls with no one else to turn to...
--- Unknown ---
I admit that in the past I've been a nasty
They weren't kidding when they called me, well, a witch
But you'll find that nowadays
I've mended all my ways
Repented, seen the light and made a switch
True?
Yes!
--- Unknown ---
And I fortunately know a little magic
It's a talent that I always have possessed
And here lately, please don't laugh
I use it on behalf
Of the miserable, lonely and depressed
--- Unknown ---
Poor unfortunate souls
In pain
In need
This one longing to be thinner
That one wants to get the girl
And do I help them?
Yes, indeed
Those poor unfortunate souls
So sad
So true
They come flocking to my cauldron
Crying, Spells, Ursula please!
And I help them?
Yes, I do
--- Unknown ---
Now it's happened once or twice
Someone couldn't pay the price
And I'm afraid I had to rake 'em 'cross the coals
Yes, I've had the odd complaint
But on the whole I've been a saint...
To those poor unfortunate souls
--- Ursula ---
Have we got a deal?
--- Ariel ---
If I become human...
I'll never be with my father or sisters again.
Ursula:
But, you'll have, your man. (laughs slyly)
Life's full of tough choices, isn't it? (laughs slyly)
Oh!
And there is, one, more, thing!
We haven't discussed the subject of payment.
--- Unknown ---
Ariel: But I don't have any -
--- Ursula ---
I'm not asking much.
Just a token, really!
A trifle!
What I want
from you is . . .
...Your voice.
--- Ariel ---
But without my voice, how can I -
--- Ursula ---
You'll have your looks!
Your pretty face!
And don't underestimate
The importance of ... body language!
Ha!
--- Unknown ---
The men up there don't like a lot of blabber
They think a girl who gossips is a bore
Yes, on land it's much preferred
For ladies not to say a word
And after all, dear, what is idle prattle for?
--- Unknown ---
Come on, they're not all that impressed with conversation
True gentlemen avoid it when they can
But they dote and swoon and fawn
On a lady who's withdrawn
It's she who holds her tongue who gets her man
--- Unknown ---
Come on, you poor unfortunate soul
Go ahead!
Make your choice!
I'm a very busy woman
And I haven't got all day
It won't cost much:
Just your voice!
--- Unknown ---
You poor unfortunate soul!
It's sad,
But true!
If you want to cross a bridge, my sweet
You've got to pay the toll
Take a gulp and take a breath
And go ahead and sign the scroll!
The boss is on a roll
