------ There's No Cure Like Travel ------
--- GIRL ---
My dear, you're sailing off without me.
Yet you don't seem to give a damn.
--- SAILOR ---
I know it's fearful of me not to be
More tearful,
But thank heaven I am.
--- GIRL ---
You mean to say you're glad to leave me?
Can I believe that's what you mean?
--- SAILOR ---
Why, don't be funny, I'm just wild about you, honey,
But I'm oh, so glad, so glad,
It's driving me mad to say goodbye
To all things that typify
The humdrum of my daily routine.
--- CREW ---
And there's no cure like travel
To help you unravel
The worries of living today.
When the poor brain is cracking
There's nothing like packing
A suitcase and sailing away.
Take a run 'round Vienna,
Granada, Ravenna, Sienna
And then a-'round Rome.
Have as high time, a low time,
And in no time
