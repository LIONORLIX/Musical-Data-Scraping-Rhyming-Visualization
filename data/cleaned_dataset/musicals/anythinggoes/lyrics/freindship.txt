------ Freindship ------
--- MOON ---
You know, Reno, we should have teamed up years ago.
--- RENO ---
We're two of a kind, all right.
--- MOON ---
Partners!
--- RENO ---
Through thick and thin!
--- MOON ---
Night and day!
--- RENO ---
Right or wrong!
--- MOON ---
If you're ever in a jam, here I am.
--- RENO ---
If you ever need a pal, I'm your gal.
--- MOON ---
If you ever feel so happy you land in jail,
I'm your bail.
--- BOTH ---
It's friendship, friendship,
Just a perfect blendship,
When other friendships have been forgot
Ours will still be hot!
Lahdle-ahdle-ahdle-dig-dig-dig.
--- MOON ---
If you're ever down a well, ring my bell.
--- RENO ---
If you ever catch on fire, send a wire.
--- MOON ---
If you ever lose your teeth
When you're out to dine,
Borrow mine.
--- BOTH ---
It's friendship, friendship,
Just a perfect blendship,
When other friendships have ceased to jell
Ours will still be swell!
Lahdle-ahdle-ahdle-hep-hep-hep.
--- RENO ---
If they ever black your eyes, put me wise.
--- MOON ---
If they ever cook your goose, turn me loose.
--- RENO ---
If they ever put a bullet through your brr-ain
I'll complain.
--- BOTH ---
It's friendship, friendship,
Just a perfect blendship,
When other friendships go up in smoke,
Ours will still be oke!
Lahdle-ahdle-ahdle-goof-goof-goof.
--- MOON ---
If you ever lose your mind, I'll be kind.
--- RENO ---
If you ever lose your shirt, I'll be hurt.
--- MOON ---
If you're ever in a mill and get sawed in half,
I won't laugh.
--- BOTH ---
It's friendship, friendship,
Just a perfect blendship,
When other friendships have been forgate
Ours will still be great!
--- RENO ---
If they ever crack your spine, drop a line.
--- MOON ---
If they ever cut your throat, write a note.
--- RENO ---
If they ever make a cannibal stew of you,
Invite me too!
--- BOTH ---
It's friendship, friendship,
Just a perfect blendship,
When other friendships are up the crick,
Ours will still be slick!
Lahdle-ahdle-ahdle-

Woof-woof-woof
--- BOTH ---
When other friendships have been forgot,
Ours will still be hot!
