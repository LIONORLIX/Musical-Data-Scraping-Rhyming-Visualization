------ Sailor's Chantey ------
--- QUARTET ---
A sailor's life is supposed to be
A hell of a lot of fun,
Yes, but when you're a sailor,
Take it from me,
You work like a son of a gun.
They give us jobs of ev'ry kind
And chores of ev'ry sort,
But sweat away, sailor, you don't mind
'Cause you know when we reach port
There will always be a lady fair,
A Jenny fair or a Sadie fair,
There'll always be a lady fair,
Who's waiting there for you.
There will always be a lady fair,
To smooth your troubles
And muss your hair,
There'll always be a lady fair,
Who's waiting there for you.
There will always be a girl's caress,
To change your answer
From a NO to YES,
There'll always be a lady fair,
