------ Blow, Gabriel, Blow ------
--- RENO ---
Brothers and sisters, we are here tonight to fight the devil...
Do you hear that playin'?
--- COMPANY ---
Yes, we hear that playin'!
--- RENO ---
Do you know who's playin'?
--- COMPANY ---
No, who is that playin'?
--- RENO ---
Well, it's Gabriel, Gabriel playin'!
Gabriel, Gabriel sayin'
Will you be ready to go
When I blow my horn?
--- Unknown ---
Oh, blow, Gabriel, blow,
Go on and blow, Gabriel, blow!
I've been a sinner, I've been a scamp,
But now I'm willin' to trim my lamp,
So blow, Gabriel, blow!
--- Unknown ---
Oh, I was low, Gabriel, low,
Mighty low, Gabriel, low.
But now since I have seen the light,
I'm good by day and I'm good by night,
So blow, Gabriel, blow!
--- Unknown ---
Once I was headed for hell,
Once I was headed for hell;
But when I got to Satan's door
I heard you blowin' on your horn once more,
So I said, Satan, farewell!
--- Unknown ---
And now I'm all ready to fly,
Yes, to fly higher and higher!
'Cause I've gone through brimstone
And I've been through the fire,
And I purged my soul
And my heart too,
So climb up the mountaintop
And start to blow, Gabriel, blow
--- ALL ---
Come on and blow, Gabriel, blow!
--- RENO ---
I want to join your happy band
And play all day in the Promised Land.
So blow, Gabriel, blow!
Come on you scamps, get up you sinners!
You're all too full of expensive dinners.
Stand up on your lazy feet and sing!
--- ALL ---
Blow, Gabriel, blow, (Blow, Gabriel!)
Go on and blow, Gabriel, blow.  (Blow, Gabriel!)
I've been a sinner, I've been a scamp,
But now I'm willin' to trim my lamp,
So blow, Gabriel, blow.
--- Unknown ---
I was low, Gabriel, low, (Low, Gabriel!)
Mighty low, Gabriel, low.
But now since that I have seen the light
I'm good by day and I'm good by night
So blow, Gabriel, blow.
--- RENO ---
Once I was headed for hell,
Once I was headed for hell;
But when I got to Satan's door
I heard you blowin' on your horn once more,
So I said, Satan, farewell!
--- Unknown ---
And now I'm all ready to fly,
Yes, to fly higher and higher!
'Cause I've gone through brimstone
And I've been through the fire,
And I purged my soul
And my heart too,
So climb up the mountaintop
And start to blow, Gabriel, blow
--- ALL ---
Go on and blow, Gabriel, blow!
--- RENO ---
I want to join your happy band
And play all day in the Promised Land.
So blow, Gabriel!
--- ALL ---
Go on and...
Blow, Gabriel, blow
Blow, Gabriel, blow
Blow, Gabriel, blow
I wanna join your happy band
And play all day in the Promised Land,
