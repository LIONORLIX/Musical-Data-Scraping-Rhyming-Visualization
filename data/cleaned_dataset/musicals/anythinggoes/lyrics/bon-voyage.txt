------ Bon Voyage ------
--- PURSER ---
Final call!  All ashore that's goin' ashore!
Final call!
--- CREW ---
Bon voyage,
--- PASSENGERS ---
You mean Bon Voyage.
--- CREW ---
I hate to say goodbye, sweetheart.
By the seashore,
--- PASSENGERS ---
You mean sur la plage.
--- All ---
I'll wait and watch the sea
Till you come back to me,
--- CREW ---
Oh my dearie,
--- PASSENGERS ---
You mean ma ch?rie,
--- CREW ---
I'm yours for life,
--- PASSENGERS ---
You mean pour la vie,
--- CREW ---
So kiss me, pretty wench,
--- All ---
In English or in French.
Bon voyage - bon voyage.
--- CREW ---
And there's no cure like travel
To help you unravel, etc.
--- PASSENGERS ---
Bon voyage,
I mean bon voyage, etc.
--- All ---
And there's no cure like travel
To help you unravel
The worries of living today.
When the poor brain is cracking
There's nothing like packing
A suitcase and sailing away.
Take a run 'round Vienna,
Granada, Ravenna, Sienna
And then a-'round Rome.
Have as high time, a low time,
And in no time
