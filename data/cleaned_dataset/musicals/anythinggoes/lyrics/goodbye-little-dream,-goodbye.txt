------ Goodbye Little Dream, Goodbye ------
--- HOPE ---
Goodbye, little dream, goodbye,
You made my romance sublime,
Now it's time to fly,
For the stars have fled from heavens,
The moon's deserted the hill,
And the sultry breeze that sang in the trees
Is suddenly strangely still.
--- Unknown ---
It's done little dream it's done,
So bid me a fond farewell,
We both had our fun.
--- Unknown ---
Was it Romeo or Juliet who said
When about to die,
Love is not all peaches and cream,
