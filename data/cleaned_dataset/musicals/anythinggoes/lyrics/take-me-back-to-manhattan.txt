------ Take Me Back To Manhattan ------
--- Reno ---
The more I travel, Across the gravel,
The more I sail the sea.
The more I feel convinced to the fact,
New York's the town for me.
That crazy skyline
Is right in my line,
And when I'm far away,
I'm able to bear it for several hours
Then I brake down and say.
--- Unknown ---
Take me back to manhattan,
Take me back to New York.
I'm just longing to see once more
My little home on the hundredth floor!
Can you wonder I'm gloomy?
Can you smile when i frown?
I miss the east side, the west side ,
the north side, and the south side.
So take me back to manhattan,
That dear old dirty town!
