------ Song On The Sand (Reprise) ------
--- Unknown ---
Something about sharing
Something about always
--- Unknown ---
Though the years race along
I still think of our song on the sand
And I still try and search for the words
I can barely remember
--- Unknown ---
Though the time tumbles by
There is one thing
That I am forever certain of
--- Unknown ---
I hear
La, da da da, da da da
Da da, da da da da
And I'm young and in love
