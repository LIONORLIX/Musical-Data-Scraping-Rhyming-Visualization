------ Look Over There (Reprise) ------
--- Unknown ---
How often is someone concerned
With the tiniest thread of your life?
Concerned with whatever you feel
And whatever you touch?
--- Unknown ---
Look over there
Look over there
Somebody cares that much
--- Unknown ---
So count all the loves who will love you
From now till the end of your life
And when you have added the loves
Who have loved me before
--- Unknown ---
Look over there
Look over there
