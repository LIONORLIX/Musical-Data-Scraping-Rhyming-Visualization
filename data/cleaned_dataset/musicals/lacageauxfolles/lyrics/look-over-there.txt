------ Look Over There ------
--- Georges ---
Have you ever wanted for anything? Private schools, cars. Cash, clothes?
Have you ever asked for anything that you didn't get?
Jean-Michel:
Yes. A little respect for what I want! A little understanding.
Georges:
A little respect? A little understanding?

How often is someone concerned
With the tiniest thread of your life?
Concerned with whatever you feel
And whatever you touch?
Look over there.
Look over there.
Somebody cares that much.
How often does somebody sense
That you need them without being told?
When you have a hurt in your heart
You're too proud to disclose?
Look over there.
Look over there.
Somebody always knows.
When your world spins too fast,
And your bubble has burst,
Someone puts himself last,
So that you can come first.
So count all the loves who will love you
From now 'til the end of your life,
And when you have added the loves
Who have loved you before,
Look over there.
Look over there.
Somebody loves you more...
When your world spins too fast,
And your bubble has burst,
Someone puts himself last,
So that you can come first.
So count all the loves who will love you
From now 'til the end of your life.
and when you have added the loves
Who have loved me before,
Look over there.
Look over there.
Somebody loves me more...
