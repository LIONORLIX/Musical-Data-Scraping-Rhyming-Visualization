------ We Are What We Are ------
--- Les Cagelles ---
We are what we are and what we are is an illusion.
We love how it feels
Putting on heels causing confusion.
We face life though it's sometimes sweet and sometimes bitter;
Face life, with a little guts and lots of glitter.
Look under our frocks: Girdles and jocks,
Proving we are what we are!

We are what we are - Half a brassiere, half a suspender.
Half real and half fluff,
You'll find it tough guessing our gender.
So Just [WHISTLE] (Hey, Taxi!)
If we please you that's the way to show us.
Just [WHISTLE] (Wolf-call)
'Cause you'll love us once you get to know us.
Look under our glitz: Muscles and tits,
Proving we are what we are.
