------ Song On The Sand (La Da Da Da) ------
--- Georges ---
Do you recall that windy little beach
we walked along?
That afternoon in Fall,
That afternoon we met?
A fellow with a concertina sang,
What was the song?
It's strange what we recall,
And odd what we forget...
I heard
La da da da da da da
As we walked on the sand.
I heard
La da da da da da da
I believe it was early September.
Though the crash of the weaves,
I could tell that the words were romantic;
Something about sharing,
Something about always.
Though the years race along,
I still think of our song on the sand.
And I still try and search for the words
I can barely remember.
Though the time tumbles by,
There is one thing that I am forever
Certain of.
I hear
La da da da da da da
Da da da da da da
And I'm young and in love.
I believe it was early September.
Though the crash of the weaves,
I could tell that the words were romantic;
Something about sharing,
Something about always.
Though the years race along,
I still think of our song on the sand.
And I still try and search for the words
I can barely remember.
Though the time tumbles by,
There is one thing that I am forever
Certain of.
I hear
La da da da da da da
Da da da da da da
And I'm young and in love...
