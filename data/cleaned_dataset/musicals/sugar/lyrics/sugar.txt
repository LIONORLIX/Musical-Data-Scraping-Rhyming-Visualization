Doin' it for Sugar
I'm only doin' it for Sugar
Although I do submit when her heart is twinkling
That I get a sprinkling of Sugar
I just wanna show her a world
A world that she's got to adore
Sugar's one of those people
That you just wanna do ev'rything for
--- Unknown ---
When it comes to Sugar
I find I'm generous and gentle
And because she's blond and she's gorgeous
Is completely coincidental
Looking in the mirror I relish
The unselfish fellow I see
Doin' it for Sugar
I'm only doin' it for Sugar
And is it wrong that while I'm doin' for Sugar
It just kinda does things for me?
--- JERRY ---
She's got a chance now
A fighting chance now
We'll find a million buck surprise
To light those little Polish eyes
--- Unknown ---
Doin' it for Sugar
I would do anything for Sugar
Although I do submit when her heart it twinkling
That I get a sprinkling of Sugar
We are gonna show her a world
A world that she's got to adore
Sugar's one of those people
That you just want to do ev'rything for
--- JOE ---
When it comes to Sugar
--- JERRY ---
Sugar, Sugar. Sugar
--- JOE ---
I find that I'm generous and gentle
--- JERRY ---
Generous and gentle
--- BOTH ---
And because she's blonde and she's gorgeous
Is completely co-incidental
Looking in the mirror I relish
The unselfish fellow I see
Doin' it for Sugar
I'm only doing it for Sugar
--- JOE ---
Is it wrong that while I'm doing for Sugar
It just kind of does things for me?
--- JERRY ---
Doin' it for Sugar --
Doin' it for Sugar --
Doin' it for Sugar --
--- JOE ---
Doin' it for Sugar
I'm only doing it for Sugar
And is it wrong that while I'm doin' it for Sugar
