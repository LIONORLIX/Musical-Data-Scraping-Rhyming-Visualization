------ November Song ------
--- OSGOOD ---
When the sun is cresting
And the Earth is prime
Ah, the youthful jesting
In the face of time
But a man grown older
And as time wears thin
Sea and Sun grow colder
And the jest turns tin
--- Unknown ---
Oh you can call it madness
If you're so inclined
But though we're somewhat older
We are still not blind
And if we go frantic for a sweet behind
Even naughty old men need love
Even naughty old men need love
--- MILLIONAIRES ---
Need love, need love, need love
--- OSGOOD ---
Oh how the heart can flutter
How the soul can sing
We live our lives a-loving or a-languishing
--- ALL ---
Is there a misty maiden with a kiss to spare?
--- OSGOOD ---
For a naughty old teddy bear
--- ALL ---
For a naughty old teddy bear
--- OSGOOD ---
I've had me moments
I've tasted some life
Ev'ry Christmastime a diff'rent wife
One was a gypsy and the on the Q.T.
One was a partridge
In a pear tree
--- Unknown ---
And would it be too baffle-ing to understand
If we should now come forward
With a small demand
--- ALL ---
We cannot hope for youth or for a crown of curls
--- OSGOOD ---
But naughty old men need naughty young girls
We must have naughty young girls
--- ALL ---
We must have naughty young girls
--- OSGOOD ---
So if you find our actions indispensable
--- ALL ---
Not only coarse and crass but reprehensible
--- OSGOOD ---
A lack of self esteem, a lack of pride and poise
--- ALL ---
We we're always naughty old men
--- OSGOOD ---
We once were dirty young boys
--- MILLIONAIRES ---
We must reiterate once again
Even naughty old men --
--- OSGOOD ---
Need love!
--- MILLIONAIRES ---
Need love, need love, need love, need love
--- OSGOOD ---
Daphne, Daphne, Daphne, write that name in the sky
Daphne, Daphne, Daphne, are you trembling like I?
--- Unknown ---
Oh you can call it madness
If you're so inclined
But though I'm somewhat older
I am still not blind.
And if I still go frantic for a sweet behind
Even naughty old men need love
Even naughty old men need love
