------ What Do You Give To A Man Who's Had Everything? ------

The experts used to try
One by one they'd plunge in
TIll Freud threw up his hands
And Adler threw the sponge in
In spite of deep concern and consultation
They were up against a stone wall of frustration

SUGAR: (spoken)
I'd sure like to help
--- JOE ---
Sorry! Sorry!
--- Unknown ---
What do you give to a man
Who's had everything
Man who's had everything
What a complication
--- Unknown ---
Where do you go
With a man who's been everywhere
Been there and back
Seeking new sensation
--- Unknown ---
What's a surprise
When two eyes have seen everything
Sights that most others have not
--- Unknown ---
What do you give to a man
Who's had everything
Been everywhere
Seen everything
Tried Heaven knows what
Of course, you might give it a shot
--- Unknown ---
Been all around
And covered ground
All others have missed
What do you give to a man
Who's had everything
Where in the world's a new twist
--- SUGAR ---
Would my kidd have zing
To a man who's had everything
See if I even come near
--- Unknown ---
(spoken)
Was that anything?
--- JOE ---
Thanks just the same1
--- Unknown ---
(sung)
It just didn't start to unfreeze
My cold heart
