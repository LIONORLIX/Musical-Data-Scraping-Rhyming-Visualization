------ Sun On My Face ------
--- TWO GIRLS ---
Chicago's eleven below
And the forecast is snow
For Chicago
--- TWO GIRLS ---
And in Milwaukee they're freezin' their tails
I can tell you it's just hell when it hails
In Milwaukee
--- FOUR GIRLS ---
But we're giving winter the old double whammy
At Eight-ten a.m.
--- ALL ---
Miami! Miami!
--- FOUR GIRLS ---
I'm gonna feel some sun on my face
--- TWO GIRLS ---
I will lay in a chair -- till
--- TWO GIRLS ---
I am medium rare -- till
--- SIX GIRLS ---
Freckles have to fight for a place
--- ALL ---
Cause -- I want some sun to come
And unfreeze me quick
--- SOLO ---
I'd be a popsicle if I just had a stick
--- THREE GIRLS ---
And with sufficient sun on my face
--- TWO GIRLS ---
I will find an enclosure
--- FOUR GIRLS ---
And get double exposure
--- ALL ---
And while my radio says Chicago's eleven below
--- FOUR GIRLS ---
I'll sit weeping sof'ly
--- FOUR GIRLS ---
Into my iced coffee
--- ALL ---
Then dry my tears with the sun on my face
With the sun on my face
With the sun on my face
--- JERRY ---
I'm gonna feel some sun on my face
--- SIX GIRLS ---
I will lay in a chair till
--- ALL ---
I am medium rare --till
Freckles have to fight for a place
--- JOE ---
Though on the beach we'll never look
Like the rest
--- JERRY ---
In spite of the handicaps
We will try to stay abreast
--- ALL ---
And with sufficient sun on my face
--- SUGAR ---
We'll tan sister to sister
--- JOE ---
Dear lord, don't let it blister
--- ALL ---
And when my radio
Says Chicago's eleven below
--- JERRY & JOE ---
We'll be sure to see ya
Post time at Hialeah
--- SUE & BIENSTOCK ---
We'll have our schnozollas
Stuck in rum and colas
--- ALL GIRLS ---
Then dry the tears with the sun on my face
--- ALL ---
And with sufficient sun on my face
I will find an anclosure
And get double exposure
And while the radio says Chicago's eleven below
I'll sit weeping sof'ly
Into my iced coffee
Then dry the tears with the sun on my face
