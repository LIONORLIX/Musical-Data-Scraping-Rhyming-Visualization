------ When Your Feet Don't Touch the Ground ------
--- Barrie ---
When did life become so complicated?
Year of too much thought and time I wasted
And in each line upon my face
Is proof I fought and lived another day
--- Unknown ---
When did life become this place of madness?
Drifting on an empty sea of waves of sadness
I make believe I'm in control
And dream it wasn't all my fault
--- Unknown ---
When your feet don't touch the ground
And your world's turn upside down
Here it's safe
In this place
Above the clouds
--- Unknown ---
When you feet don't touch the earth
You can't feel the things that hurt
And you're free
There's no need
To come down
--- Peter ---
Every day just feels a little longer
Why am I the only one not getting stronger
Running round pretending life's a play
Doesn't make the darkness go away
--- Unknown ---
I may be young but I can still remember
Feeling full of joy, crying tears of laughter
Now all my tears are ll cried out
Make believe but count me out
--- Unknown ---
Cause my feet are on the ground
And the inner voice I found
Tells the truth
There's no use
If your head's in the clouds
--- Barrie ---
I was once like you
Life was a maze
I couldn't find my way out
But what I say is true
You'll be amazed
Make believe and you will find out that it's true
--- Peter ---
I know what is true
--- Both ---
When your feet don't touch the ground
And your voice won't make a sound
--- Unknown ---
Barrie: Here it's safe
Peter: It tells the truth
--- Unknown ---
Barrie: In this place
Peter: There's no use
--- Unknown ---
Barrie Above the clouds
Peter: The clouds
--- Unknown ---
Both: When your feet
Barrie: Don't touch the earth
Peter: Touch the earth
--- Unknown ---
Both: You can't feel the things that hurt
--- Unknown ---
Barrie: And you're free
Peter: And I am fine
--- Unknown ---
Barrie: There's no need
Peter: As long as I
--- Unknown ---
Barrie: To come down
Peter: Down
--- Unknown ---
Both: When your feet
Barrie: Don't touch the ground
Peter: Touch the ground
--- Unknown ---
Barrie: When your feet don't
Both: Touch the ground
