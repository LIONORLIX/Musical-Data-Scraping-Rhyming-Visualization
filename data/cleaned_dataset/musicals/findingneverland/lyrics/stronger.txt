In the darkest place,
there's the faintest light,
as we hope to face,
the hardest fight fate delivers me.
I don't need their sympathy.
--- Unknown ---
Cause they can't take away my mind,
where I will go they will never find.
--- Unknown ---
I've got to be stronger,
reach up higher,
must dig deeper, find the fire.
--- Unknown ---
Feel enlightened, can't be frightened any more.
--- Unknown ---
I can run now, so much faster.
Now defeat won't be my master.
For to conquer the demons I won't have to wait any longer.
--- Unknown ---
I've got to be stronger.
--- Unknown ---
You'll see in time. You will survive.
Too soon to run, too late to hide.
It's your destiny, every pace, every stride.
--- Unknown ---
I am stronger,
reach up higher,
digging deeper,
found the fire.
--- Unknown ---
Feel enlightened,
won't be frightened any more.
--- Unknown ---
I can run now,
so much faster.
Now defeat won't,
be my master.
--- Unknown ---
For to conquer the demons,
I won't have to wait any longer.
--- Unknown ---
I've got to be stronger.
--- Unknown ---
I am stronger.
--- Unknown ---
Now I'm stronger.
