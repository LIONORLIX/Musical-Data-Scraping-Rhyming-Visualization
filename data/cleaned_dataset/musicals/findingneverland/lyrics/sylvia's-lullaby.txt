------ Sylvia's Lullaby ------
--- Sylvia ---
Quietly hush now to sleep
On the wings of a butterfly
Let all your cares drift away
For now is the end of the day
--- Unknown ---
If you close your eyes and count to ten
You'll hear your dream are calling again
Just follow the moon, for all to soon
A new day will appear
--- Unknown ---
You'll have nothing to fear
For wherever you are
And forever
