------ All of London Is Here Tonight ------
--- Unknown ---
(Intro)
--- Chorus ---
Anyone! Anyone! Anyone who's anyone is here!
Anyone! Anyone! Anyone who's anyone is here!
--- Charles ---
From London's west end to the great white way
I've discovered the best playrights working today.
You were wild about Oscar, so I gave you more!
I supported Brenard when no one was sure!
May I make a toast
to a man who'd never boast
He's prolific and reliable
His style is undeniable!
I trust you're impressed
Chorus:
Yes!
Charles:
With his play, The Wedding Guest
Chorus:
Yes! Yes!
Charles:
So raise your glasses with me!
The one and only...
J.M. Barrie!
--- Chorus ---
What a show!
What a night!
How the world's delight!
Raise your glass, raise your voice in cheer!
All of London is here!
And a toast
to his wife!
And their perfect life!
Happy to be, happy to be here!
--- James ---
Just listen to those cheers
Even though I haven't had a new idea in years
I need to find the spark inside
to lead me somewhere new
If I could somehow turn this all around
I'd turn my whole world upside-down
--- Mary ---
James! Are you feeling alright?
Get yourself together, all of London's here tonight!
Try, at least, to be the man who's worthy of his fame
Tonight they're here to celebrate your name
Let's drink champagne!
--- Charles ---
To young Barry!
--- Chorus ---
What a show!
What a night!
How the world's delight...
Raise your glass in cheer!
And a toast
to his wife
And their perfect life...
All of London is...
Anyone!
Anyone!
Anyone!
Anyone!
Anyone!
Anyone!
--- Chorus + Charles ---
Anyone who's anyone is here!
--- James ---
Is this all I am?
Have I given this all I can give?
Who I am...
Is this the life I'm meant to live?
Is this all I am?
