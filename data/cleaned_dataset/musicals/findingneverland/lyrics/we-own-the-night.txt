------ We Own the Night ------
--- Unknown ---
Where's the light
in all this darkness
all at once I've lost my way
Blinded with pain
Far from the innocence I'll never find again
Time is the fire in which we all burn
Time that is lost in ever page that I turn
--- Unknown ---
When we're apart I feel the isolation
For your heartbeat is my affirmation
Need you under my skin and in air that I breathe
To wake alone without you is too hard to conceive
--- Unknown ---
When we're apart there's only desolation
Nothing seems to work its only frustration
The sun will still be rising
But we're still out of sight
Tomorrow is too far away
Till then we own the night
--- Unknown ---
I follow the moon
As it is falling from the sky now way too fast
I try to deny
The new day dawning just to make each moment last
Time is the chill that creeps on my skin
Freezing my heart and my soul from within
--- Unknown ---
When we're apart I feel the isolation
For your heartbeat is my affirmation
Need you under my skin and in air that I breathe
To wake alone without you is too hard to conceive
--- Unknown ---
When we're apart there's only desolation
Nothing seems to work its only frustration
The sun will soon be rising
But its still out of sight
Tomorrow is still far away
Till then we own the night
--- Unknown ---
The night
--- Unknown ---
Time is the fire in which we all are burning
The night
The night
--- Unknown ---
Time which is flying can't stop the world from turn
--- Unknown ---
We own the night
We own the night
Hold me close
Hold me tight
We own the night
--- Unknown ---
When we're apart I feel the isolation
For your heartbeat is my affirmation
Need you under my skin and in air that I breathe
To wake alone without you is too hard to conceive
--- Unknown ---
When we're apart there's only desolation
Nothing seems to work its only frustration
The sun will soon be rising
But its still out of sight
Tomorrow is too far away
Till then we own the night
