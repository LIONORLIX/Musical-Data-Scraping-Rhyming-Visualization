------ My Death ------
--- Unknown ---
My death waits like an old rou√©
So confident I'll go his way
Whistle to him and the pa*sing time
My death waits like a bible truth
At the funeral of my youth
Weep loud for that and the pa*sing time
My death waits like a witch at night
As surely as our love is bright
Let's not think about the pa*sing time
--- CHORUS ---
But what ever lies behind the door
There is nothing much to do
Angel or devil, I don't care
For in front of that door, there is you
--- Unknown ---
My death waits like a beggar blind
Who sees the world through an unlit mind
Throw him a dime for the pa*sing time
My death waits there between your thighs
Your cool fingers will close my eyes
Let's not think of that and the pa*sing time
My death waits to allow my friends
A few good times before it ends
So let's drink to that and the pa*sing time
--- CHORUS ---
--- Unknown ---
My death waits there among the leaves
In magicians' mysterious sleeves
Rabbits and dogs and the pa*sing time
My death waits there among the flowers
Where the blackest shadow, blackest shadow cowers
Let's pick lilacs for the pa*sing time
My death waits there in a double bed
Sails of oblivion at my head
