------ Me And My Girl ------
--- Unknown ---
Life's an empty thing.
Life can be so awful lonesome
If you're always on your own some
Life's an empty thing.
Life's a diff'rent thing
When you've found the one and only,
Then you feel no longer lonely,
Life's a happy thing.
--- Unknown ---
Ev'rything was topsy turvy,
Life seemed all wrong,
But it came all right
As soon as she came along.
--- Unknown ---
Me and my girl,
Meant for each other,
Sent for each other,
And liking it so.
Me and my girl,
'Sno use pretending,
We knew the ending a long time ago.
--- Unknown ---
Some little chruch with a big steeple,
Just a few people that both of us know
And we'll have love, laughter,
Be happy ever after,
Me and my girl.
