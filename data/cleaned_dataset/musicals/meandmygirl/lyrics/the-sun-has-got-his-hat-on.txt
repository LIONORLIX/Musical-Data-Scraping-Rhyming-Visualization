And ev'ryone's happy and gay.

We'll soon be in clover,
So pack all your troubles away.

He's been roastin peanuts out in Timbuctoo,
Now he's coming back to do the same for you.
So jump into your sunbath
Hip-hip-hip-hooray!

And he's coming out today.
Never saw the grass so green
Never saw the sky so blue
What a lot of fun to ev'ryone,
Sitting in the sun all day.
