------ Love Makes The World Go Round ------
--- Unknown ---
Ask your heart,
What gave the world its start?
Why do the seasons come and go?
Ask your heart,
What causes the sunrise?
Only your heart will know.
Why after the sunset,
The moon's aglow,
I used to wonder,
But now I know
The world keeps on turning,
You can't stop it turning,
For love makes the world go round
An old love, a new love,
So long as it's true love,
It's love makes the world go round.
Without love,
Nobody would sing,
Without love,
No wedding bells ring.
And tho' people doubt it,
They can't live without it,
All over the world they've found
That love makes the world go round.

For love makes the world go round.
Yes, love makes the world go round.

Without love,
Nobody would sing,
Without love,
No wedding bells ring.
And tho' people doubt it,
They can't live without it,
All over the world they've found
