------ Preparation Fugue / The Lambeth Walk ------
--- Unknown ---
Lambeth you've never seen,
The skies ain't blue, the grass ain't green.
It hasn't got the Mayfair touch,
But that don't matter very much.
We play the Lambeth way,
Not like you but a bit more gay
And when we have a bit of fun
Oh, Boy.
--- Unknown ---
Anytime you're Lambeth way
Any evening, any day,
You'll find us all doin' the Lambeth walk.
--- Unknown ---
Ev'ry little Lambeth gal
With her little Lambeth pal,
You'll find 'em all doin' the Lambeth walk.
--- Unknown ---
Ev'rything's free and easy,
Do as you darn well pleasey,
Why don't you make your way there,
Go there, stay there,
--- Unknown ---
Once you get down Lambeth way,
Ev'ry evening, ev'ry day,
You'll find yourself doin' the Lambeth walk.
