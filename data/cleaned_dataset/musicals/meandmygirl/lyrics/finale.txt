Without love, nobody would sing.
Without love, no wedding bells ring.
The world keeps on turning,
You can't stop it turning
For love makes the world go round.
An old love, a new love,
So long as it's true love,
It's love makes the world go round.
Without love, nobody would sing.
Without love, no wedding bells ring.
And though people doubt it,
They can't live without it,
All over the world they found,
That love makes the world go round.

Me and my girl, meant for each other,
Sent for each other and liking it so.
Me and my girl, 's'no use pretending,
We knew the ending a long time ago.
--- Unknown ---
Some little church, with a big steeple,
Just a few people that both of us know.
And we'll have love, laughter, be happy ever after,
