------ Hold My Hand ------
--- Unknown ---
You require a lot of looking after.
That's one job in which I take a pride.
You can always make me smile, make my journey seem worthwhile.
Why not keep me always at your side to guide you?
--- Unknown ---
Hold my hand
No matter what the weather,
Just you hold my hand,
We'll walk through life together,
For you'll find in me that kind of a friend
Who will see me through to the end.
--- Unknown ---
So if you'll hold my hand
We both shall walk more steadily.
For understand, you hold my heart already in that dreamland:
