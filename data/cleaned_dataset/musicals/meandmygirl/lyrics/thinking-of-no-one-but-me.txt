------ Thinking Of No-One But Me ------
--- Unknown ---
I once had a notion that we'd along.
I still have that notion but maybe I'm wrong.
The female emotion will thrive on,
I learn, a little investment
And plenty of return.
--- Unknown ---
Me, I'm for the top of the tree
Just you look on and you'll see
What's going to happen to me
--- Unknown ---
I want all that money can buy
I'll make my limit the sky
This is hurray and goodbye.
--- Unknown ---
While I'm young and healthy
I'll find someone wealthy
Some rich city prize
With rings on his finger
And under his eyes.
--- Unknown ---
Me, just you look up and you'll see
Me on the top of the tree
Thinking nothing of no one but me.
--- Unknown ---
I'll make men so fond
That their pulses will stir
And I'll be the blonde
That the fellows prefer
The past that I clung to
Is now on the wing
Don't care where I'm flung to
I'm going to have my fling

Me, I'm for the top of the tree
Just you look on and you'll see
--- Unknown ---
What's going to happen to me?
--- Unknown ---
I Want all that money can buy
I'll make my limit the sky
This is hurray and goodbye.
--- Unknown ---
While I'm young and healthy
I'll find someone wealthy
Some big city man
Who'll cancel the contract as soon as he can
Me, just you look up and you'll see
Me on the top of the tree
Thinking nothing of no one but -
