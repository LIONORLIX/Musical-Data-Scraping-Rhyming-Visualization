As the Family Solicitor
Here's my advice to you,
As the Family Solicitor
Here's what you ought to do,
For six and eight
I'll put you straight
If anything goes wrong
For I contend you must pretend
That life is one sweet song.
--- Unknown ---
So, sing a little and dance a little,
Be gay a little and play a little,
Bring your troubles more and more
To the Family Solicitor.
Say a little and think a little
And eat a little and drink a little,
Keep a drop of the 'ninety-four'
For the Family Solicitor!
--- Unknown ---
He'll take all your cases,
Keep you in your places,
Maybe save your faces,
Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!
--- Unknown ---
Hop a little and skip a little
And jump a little, let rip a little.
Thank your lucky stars once more
For the Family, the Family,
The Family Solicitor.
--- Unknown ---
He'll take all our cases,
Keep us in our places.
Maybe save our faces!
Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!
