------ All I Ask Of You - Shirley Bassey ------
--- Unknown ---
(From The Phantom Of The Opera)
--- Unknown ---
No more talk
of darkness,
Forget these
wide-eyed fears.
I'm here,
nothing can harm you -
my words will
warm and calm you.
--- Unknown ---
Let me be
your freedom,
let daylight
dry -your tears.
I'm here,
with you, beside you,
to guard you
and to guide you . . .
--- Unknown ---
Say you love me
every
waking moment,
turn my head
with talk of summertime . . .
--- Unknown ---
Say you need me
with you,
now and always . . .
promise me that all
you say is true -
that's all I ask
of you . . .
--- Unknown ---
Let me be
your shelter,
let me
be your light.
You're safe:
No-one will find you
your fears are
far behind you . . .
--- Unknown ---
All I want
is freedom,
a world with
no more night . . .
and you
always beside me
to hold me
and to hide me . . .
--- Unknown ---
Then say you'll share with
me one
love, one lifetime . . .
Iet me lead you
from your solitude . . .
--- Unknown ---
Say you need me
with you
here, beside you . . .
anywhere you go,
let me go too -
Christine,
that's all I ask
of you . . .
--- Unknown ---
Say you'll share with
me one
love, one lifetime . . .
say the word
and I will follow you . . .
--- Unknown ---
Share each day with
me, each
night, each morning . . .
--- Unknown ---
Say you love me . . .
--- Unknown ---
You know I do . . .
--- Unknown ---
Love me -
that's all I ask
of you . . .
--- Unknown ---
Anywhere you go
let me go too . . .
Love me -
that's all I ask
