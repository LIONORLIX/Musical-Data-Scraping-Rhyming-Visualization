Child of the wilderness
Born into emptiness
Learn to be lonely
Learn to find your way in darkness
--- Unknown ---
Who will be there for you
Comfort and care for you
Learn to be lonely
Learn to be your one companion
--- Unknown ---
Never dreamed out in the world
There are arms to hold you
You?ve always known your heart was on its own
--- Unknown ---
So laugh in your loneliness
Child of the wilderness
Learn to Be lonely
Learn how to love life that is lived alone
--- Unknown ---
Learn to be lonely
