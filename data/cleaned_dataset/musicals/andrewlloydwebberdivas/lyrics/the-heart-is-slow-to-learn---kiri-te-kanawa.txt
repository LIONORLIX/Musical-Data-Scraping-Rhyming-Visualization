------ The Heart Is Slow To Learn - Kiri Te Kanawa ------
--- Unknown ---
the heart is slow to learn
the heart is slow to learn
these feelings that i feel
are foolish but their real
i'm wise enough to see this love will never be
i'd try to let us know theres still no letting go
--- Unknown ---
i know it's mad and you won't return
but still as i have said
the heart is slow to learn
--- Unknown ---
i'll never love as i have loved you
why is love cruel i wish i knew
say what you will
it doesn't matter
untill i die there's only you
untill i die there's only you
--- Unknown ---
the heart is slow to learn
the heart is slow to learn
you'd think there would be a way
to shut out yesterday
perhaps if i just thought
of all the times we fought
i'd try to let us know theres still no letting go
--- Unknown ---
i know it's mad and you won't return
but then as i have said the heart is slow to learn
--- Unknown ---
i'll never love as i have loved you
why is love cruel i wish i knew
say what you will it doesn't matter
untill i die theres only you
untill i die theres only you
