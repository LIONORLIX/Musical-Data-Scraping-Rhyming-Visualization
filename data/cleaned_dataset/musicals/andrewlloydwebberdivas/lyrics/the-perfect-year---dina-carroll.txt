------ The Perfect Year - Dina Carroll ------
--- Unknown ---
(From Sunset Boulevard)
--- Unknown ---
Ring out the old
Ring in the new
A midnight wish
To share with you
Your lips are warm
My head is light
Were we alive
Before tonight
--- Unknown ---
I dont need a crowded ball room
Everything I want is here
If you're with me
Next year will be...
The perfect year
--- Unknown ---
Before we play
Some dangerous game
Before we fan
Some harmless flame
we have to ask
If this is wise
And if the game
Is worth the prize
--- Unknown ---
With this wine and with the music
How can anything be clear
Let's just wait and see
It may just be
The Perfect Year
--- Unknown ---
It's New Year's eve
And hopes are high
Dance one year in
Kiss one goodbye
Another chance
Another start
So many dreams
To tease the heart
--- Unknown ---
We don't need a crowded ballroom
Everything we want is hear
And face to face
We will embrace
The perfect year
--- Unknown ---
We don't need a crowded ballroom
Everthing we want is hear
and face to face
We will embrace
