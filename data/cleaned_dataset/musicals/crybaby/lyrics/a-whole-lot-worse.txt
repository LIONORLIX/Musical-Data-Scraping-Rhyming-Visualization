------ A Whole Lot Worse ------
--- Unknown ---
(spoken) Honey, you wanna know about bad?
--- Unknown ---
When I was a young girl
'Bout the age of one
I shot up my crib
With a BB gun
I never behaved
Never followed no rules
They kicked me out of my nursery school!
--- Unknown ---
Every year for Mother's Day I'd steal my mother's purse
So if you wanna be bad
You're gonna have to do a whole lot worse
--- Unknown ---
My whole life long
I've been called a disgrace
I can hold up a bank
Using only my face
I'm the nastiest creature
You ever did see
On Halloween I dress up as me!
--- Unknown ---
One look my way could make an angry mob disperse
So if you wanna be bad
You're gonna have to do a whole lot worse
--- Unknown ---
You're so squeaky clean
You're so spic and span
You never litter
Or loiter
Or drink from a can!
--- Unknown ---
So when you start bragging 'bout your wicked life
We're like switchblades laughing a butter knife
--- Unknown ---
My body's a paradise
Of swivels and curves
Ever since I was twelve
I've been a magnet for perves
One day the Oscar Mayer man
Tried to cop a feel
I climbed up and stabbed him in his weinermobile!
--- Unknown ---
I nearly turned that hotdog into a hearse
--- Unknown ---
So do you wanna be bad?
Or mean?
Or plain perverse?
--- Unknown ---
(spoken) Yeah!
--- Unknown ---
If you wanna be bad
You're gonna have to do a whole lot worse
--- Unknown ---
It takes years to be bad
It ain't no passing fad
It takes commitment and time to master petty crime
--- Unknown ---
So if you want your degree
In delinquency
You're gonna have to be...
--- Unknown ---
A whole hell of a lot worse!
