------ I'm Infected (Reprise) ------

--- Unknown ---
Now I'm burning,
and I'm yearning,
and I'm longing,
and I'm lusting
--- Unknown ---
My thoughts have gone from dirty to truly disgusting
--- Unknown ---
In my every treasure,
he can break my every lock
He can go under my shirt,
over my bra, my bra!
--- Unknown ---
I'm infecting,
I'm infecting,
have a fever thats unconnected
--- Unknown ---
From that one kiss I can tell,
I feel much worse feeling well
Cry Baby I'm infected with your love,
Cry Baby I'm infected with your love
