No way you could

See, I've got a vision
Of a world that's fair (of a world that's fair)
Where it don't matter (no, it don't)

A world where let's say, I don't know
My parents don't fry in a chair! (no-o)

The day my folks died was the day I swore
I would never back down just because I was poor
A little respect is all I'm asking you for
But when I show you my face, you show me the door!

Nobody gets me! (no no)
Don't bother to try (don't even try)
Keep right on calling me names (mmhm)
I'll never cry (no, will never cry!)
I'm in complete command of the lacrimal gland in each eye!
