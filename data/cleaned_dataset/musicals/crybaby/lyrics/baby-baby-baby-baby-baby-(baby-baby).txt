I wanna dedicate this to a certain special lady
I can't believe you're here tonight
It thrills me through and through
In fact I'm gonna improvise a love song just for you

Well, Baby Baby Baby Baby Baby Baby Baby
Baby Baby Baby Baby Baby Baby Baby
Baby Baby Baby Baby Baby Baby Baby Baby
Baby Baby Baby Baby, Hoo
--- Unknown ---
That's the way you fill my heart
That's how you make me feel
But I have even more complex emotions to review
--- Unknown ---
Well, Baby Baby Baby Baby Baby Baby Baby
Baby Baby Baby Baby Baby Baby Baby
Baby Baby Baby Baby Baby Baby Baby Baby
Baby Baby Baby Baby, It's for real!

In all the world the sweetest thing this boy ever saw
There's one more vivid verbal picture I would like to draw
Well, Baby Baby Baby Baby Baby Baby Baby
Baby Baby Baby Baby Baby Baby Baby
Baby Baby Baby Baby Baby Baby Baby Baby
Baby Baby Baby Baby, Ooo la la!

Most guys have no lyrics left at this point in the song
But if you think you'll ever stop inspiring me you're wrong
Well, Baby Baby Baby Baby Baby Baby Baby
Baby Baby Baby Baby Baby Baby Baby
Baby Baby Baby Baby Baby Baby Baby Baby
Baby Baby Baby Baby, Ahh
