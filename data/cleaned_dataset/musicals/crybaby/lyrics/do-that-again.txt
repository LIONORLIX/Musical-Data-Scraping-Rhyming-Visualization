------ Do That Again ------
--- Unknown ---
You make me shiver, make me quiver, make me shake in my shoes
I'm in a tizzy, feeling dizzy, like I drank too much booze
You put a strain on my brain, think I'm going insane
You got me howling like a dog that got locked out in the rain
--- Unknown ---
Oh, baby, first you tear my heart up and you trample my soul
You know my mind is getting scrambled like an egg in a bowl
You got me reeling, got me squealing like a pig in a pen
You know I can't take it, baby. Do that again!
--- Unknown ---
One look at you and I just can't calm my nerves
I must have missed the sign that said Dangerous Curves
Feeling weak, feeling faint, like I breathed too much paint
You're making all those other girls seem outdated and quaint
--- Unknown ---
Oh, baby, now you got me begging, got me down on me knees
It's like you covered me with honey and then dunked me in bees
The pain I'm in is constant, it's not just now and then
You know I can't take it, baby. Do that again!
