Screw loose
That's what they say I've got
Or maybe they say I'm not
Playing with a full deck
But hey!
What the heck! Can I do-oo-oo?
Baby, I've got a screw loose for you
--- Unknown ---
Bonkers
That's what they're calling me
Not metaphorically
They mean truly insane
But they can't hear the voice in my brai-ai-ai-ain
Giving orders to keep loving you
--- Unknown ---
Eccentric
Erratic
toys in the bellfree
bats in the attic
But I just don't see the harm
In carving your name in my a-arm
--- Unknown ---
Nee-nee-ow (the whole melody)
--- Unknown ---
Darling
It's so-o
Hard to be sixteen and schitzo
But I know it's worth the cost
I made up my mind which I have lo-ost
*very breathy oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh*
--- Unknown ---
Screw loose
Clinically certified
A panel of doctors try
To lock my away
But until that day when they finally do-oo-
--- Unknown ---
"I know! Leave me alone! Gosh."
--- Unknown ---
I am here if you need a loo-oose screw
