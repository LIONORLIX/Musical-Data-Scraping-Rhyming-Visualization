------ I'm Infected ------
--- ALLISON ---
I suffered through the measles
I made it through the mumps
Chicken pox's was nothing
I nicknamed all bumps
--- Unknown ---
But now my palms sweaty
And my tickers skipping thumps
My skin is turning green
My thoughts are so  unclean
I think cupid slipped a mickie in my polio-vaccine
--- Unknown ---
I'm infected, I'm infected
With these feelings that you've injected
In my arm and in my heart
Feeling in every body part
Baby I'm infected with your love
Baby I'm infected with your love
--- CRY BABY ---
Ain't never seen no doctor
Ain't never take you sick
One time I had the stab wound
A band aid did the trick
--- Unknown ---
I'm the type who suffers
On some tiny little prick
But this tenderness I feel
Is painful, and its real
My soul just gotta boo-boo
And no wowie pop can heal
--- Unknown ---
I'm infected, I'm infected
With these feelings that you've injected
Now your pulsing through each vein
And your pounding in my brain
Oh Baby, I'm infected with your love
Baby I'm infected with your love
--- ALLISON ---
Now I'm yearning
--- CRY BABY ---
And I'm burning
--- ALLISON ---
And am I sighing
--- CRY BABY ---
And I'm moaning
--- ALLISON ---
Could it be the greases monkeys
That the vaccine was groaning
--- Unknown ---
ALLISON/CRY BABY
Whatever you've shot into me
I need another dose
--- CRY BABY ---
Wait!
Did you say greases monkeys
Man, thats gross...
--- Unknown ---
ALLISON/CRY BABY
That's gross!
--- Unknown ---
ALLISON/CRY BABY
Were infected!
Were infected!
Lets take this love
Only as directed
--- Unknown ---
It's much worse diagnosis
Then mononucleosis
But it feels so much better than I ever expected
--- Unknown ---
MRS. VERNON-WILLIAMS
Allison!
--- CRYBABY ---
I've never felt so queezy
I've never felt so high
I'm getting from a vision
From an angel so divine
No matter what I've gotta do
I'm gonna make her mine
I'm infected, I'm infected
