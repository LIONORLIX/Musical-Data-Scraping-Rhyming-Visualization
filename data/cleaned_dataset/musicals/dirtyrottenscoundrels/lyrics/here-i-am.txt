------ Here I Am ------
--- CHRISTINE ---
Would ya look at that coffered
ceiling,
Look at that chandelier.
Excuse me but how I'm feeling
IS a hundred-proof.
I could raise the roof.
I'm so happy to be here.
I've been kind of missing
Mom and Daddy,
Sort of in a spin since Cinncinatti.
The morning flight, a major bore
But then they open the cabin door
And zoot alors-
Here I am!
--- Unknown ---
Lord knows I had the will
And the resources
But Mom and Dad kept saying
Hold your horses.
I guess those ponies couldn't wait-
Pardon me folks but
They've left the gate
I may be late, but
Here I am!
--- Unknown ---
Ah,
The way to be, to me, is French
The way to say La Vie is French
So here I am, Beaumont Sur Mer, a
Big two weeks on the Rivier-a.
If I'm only dreaming
Please don't wake me.
Let the summer sun
And Breezes take me.
Excuse me if I seem jejeune,
I promise I'll find my marbles soon
--- Unknown ---
But everywhere I look
It's like a scene from a book.
Open the book and
Here I am!
--- Unknown ---
I mean
The air is French
That chair is French
This nice sincere sancerre is French
The skies are French
The pies are French
Those guys are French
These fries are French!
Pardon me if I
Fly off the handle,
No place else on earth
Can hold a candle
--- Unknown ---
So, Veni Vidi Vici, folks
Let's face it,
Je suis ici, folks!
--- Unknown ---
Excusez-moi
If i spout-
I'm letting my
Je n'sais qoi out.
I'm sorry to shout but
--- Unknown ---
CHRISTINE/ENSEMBLE
Here I am!
