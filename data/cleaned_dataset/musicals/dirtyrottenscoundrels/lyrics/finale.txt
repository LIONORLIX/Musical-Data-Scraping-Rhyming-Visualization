--- CHRISTINE ---
Y'know, boys,I cleared over five
million dollars last year, but I gotta
tell you- your fifty thousand was the
most fun I ever had.
--- Unknown ---
It was a ball
It was a blast.
'Cause I was haning with the boys
And that's a plus.
--- Unknown ---
You've got teh class,
You've got the cheek,

You've got he brains.
--- CHRISTINE ---
Let's get that Greek.
--- FREDDY ---
I guess we're dirty rotten crooks...
--- LAWRENCE ---
Dirty rotten shnooks...
--- CHRISTINE ---
Dirty rotten guys...
--- ALL ---
It was a trip,
It was a ball,
It was a kick,
I loved it all,
'Cause it was almost too prodigious
to discuss-
--- CHRISTINE ---
And though two aces beat you blind,
They'll never beat three of a kind-
--- Unknown ---

Dirty rotten guys...
