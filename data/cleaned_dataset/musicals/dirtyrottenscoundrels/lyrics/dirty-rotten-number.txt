You may be master of
Your chosen occupation
With several strings of
Polo ponies in your stable-
ou must remember all the same
That at the crux of every game
Is knowing when it's time
To leave the table.
--- Unknown ---
And it's important to be artful
in your exit-
No turning back, you must accept
the con is done,
But now and then, you might recall
The moments when you had it al-
You ahd teh charm,
You had the talent
And, my God, you hd some fun.
--- Unknown ---
It was a ball, it was a blast
And it's a shame it couldn't last,
But every chapter has to end,
You must agree.
It was a joy, it was sublime,
A splendid way to earn a dime
For a dirty rotten guy like me.
--- Unknown ---
When you look back on all your
conquests and deceptions
You see a thousand flawless pearls
set in a strand,
Laid out from Biarritz to Rome,
Each one as perfect as a poem-
An opus to be proud of though it's
written in the sand.
--- Unknown ---
It was a ball, it was a thrill,
You had teh grace, you had the skill
To know exactly what to say
And what to do.
You wouldn't trade a single day
Or have it any other way-
A dirty rotten guy like you.

It's almost a religion-
The need to take a pigeon
And to play your part
With elegance and zest
--- Unknown ---
But when it's time to fold the act
And your duffel bag is packed
Take comfort in the fact
That you've been
working with the best.
--- Unknown ---
It was a blast, it was a ball
It was a gas, I loved it all
'Cause I was hanging with the man
And that's a plus.

It was a trip, it was a blast
It was a shame it couldn't lsat
'Cause it was almost
Too prodigious to discuss.
