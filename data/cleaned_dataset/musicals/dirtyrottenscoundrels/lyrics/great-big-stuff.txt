I thought I'd seen it all,
I thought I knew the score.
But coming here, I've found a world
I'd never seen before.
Now I know Where I belong-
A life of taste and class
With culture and sophisitication
pouring out my ass.

I want my silver spoon.
Don't need it right now
But I better get it soon.

I want a mansion with a moat
Around which I will float
With some vast-bottom babies
In my glass-bottom boat.

Oh give me a home
Where the centerfolds roam

And Hef'll have me over
To play some naked Twister
Blotto in the Grotto
With a Playmate and her sister.

The Islands in the winter
The Hamptons in the summer,
The fashion plate I date'll give me
Hummers in my Hummer.

The cash to keep me idle,
The chicks to keep me vital,
The pills to keep me happy
Even when I'm suicidal.
