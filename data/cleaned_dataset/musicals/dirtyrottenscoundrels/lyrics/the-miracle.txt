------ The Miracle ------
--- CHRISTINE ---
And when it seems
Your hopes and dreams
Are on the run again,
--- Unknown ---
Bad luck has won again
And it won't stop-
--- Unknown ---
The clouds wil part
And you will start.
To see the sun again.
And life's a ball, you're standing tall,
You've found your way back to the
top-
--- Unknown ---
Breath in and taste the ocean
breeze.
Look at the way the leaves are
Dancing in the banyan trees.
Listen to what they are singing to
you-
Nothing is too wonderful-
--- FREDDY ---
Nothing is too wonderful-
