------ Nothing Is Too Wonderful To Be True ------
--- CHRISTINE ---
Look at the way the moon behaves.
Look at the way she paints
A silver ribbon on the waves.
One thig I've leanred and I'll share
with you-
Nothing is too wonderful to be true.
Each moment opens like a flower.
The age of miracles comes
Every hour on the hour.
Turn any corner,
There's something new
And nothing is too wonderful
To be true.
If I'm preceived to be
Naive to be the way I am
Let people say I am a silly goof
--- Unknown ---
Is life a plateful? Am I grateful?
Every day I am,
It's an amazing world in which we live
And I've got living proof.
--- Unknown ---
Look at the way the moon behaves.
Look at the way she paints
A silver ribbon on the waves
Leading directly to me and you.
--- Unknown ---
Nothing is too wonderful to be true.
Nothing is too wonderful to be true.

Oh, can't you see it? Can't you see it?
--- FREDDY ---
You know, I think I can.
--- CHRISTINE ---
Tell me.
--- FREDDY ---
Uh...
--- Unknown ---
Magic can happen anywhere
I knew this guy at camp
Who ate his t-shirt on a dare.
My hotel gives away free shampoo.
Nothing is too wonderful to be true.
--- CHRISTINE ---
Go on.
--- FREDDY ---
Geez...
--- Unknown ---
Sometimes God grants
Your heart's desiere-
Once I was caller number eight;
I won a set of tires.
They held up that midget
With Krazy Glue
Nothing is too wonderful to be true.

Nothing is too wonderful to be true.
