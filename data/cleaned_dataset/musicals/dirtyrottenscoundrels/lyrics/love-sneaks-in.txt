------ Love Sneaks In ------
--- LAWRENCE ---
Love sneaks in
When everything seems quiet,
Set the bait
And like a fool you buy it.
Your famous self-possession's
Vanished from your repertoire-
This is what can happen when you
Leave the door ajar..
--- Unknown ---
And love sneaks in
And whispers to you sweetly
Silly words that change your life
completely.
--- Unknown ---
You're fumbling in the dark.
The master's now the mark.
You're out of luck
If love sneaks in on you.
--- Unknown ---
The player has been nicely played
The mocker's now the mocked-
That's what tends to happen when
You leave the door unlocked.
--- Unknown ---
And love sneaks through
The usual defenses.,
The sighs, th smirks
That state the old pretenses.
What's gone is what you were.
What's left is all a blur.
You're stung, you're stuck
For love snuck in with her.
