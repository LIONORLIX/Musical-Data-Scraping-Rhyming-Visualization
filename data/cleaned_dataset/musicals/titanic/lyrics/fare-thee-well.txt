------ Fare-thee-well ------
--- Unknown ---
It was midnight on the sea,
Band playin' Nearer My God to Thee
Cryin', Fare thee, Titanic, fare the well,
Titanic when it got its load,
Captail hollered, All aboard,
Cryin', Fare thee, Titanic, fare the well,
--- Unknown ---
Jack Johnson want to get on board,
Captain said, I ain't hauling no coal,
Cryin', Fare thee, Titanic, fare the well,
--- Unknown ---
Titanic was comin 'round the curve,
When she ran in to a big iceberg,
Cryin', Fare thee, Titanic, fare the well,
--- Unknown ---
Titanic was sinkin' down,
Had lifeboats all around
Cryin', Fare thee, Titanic, fare the well,
--- Unknown ---
Had them lifeboats all around,
Savin the women and children, lettin' men go down,
Cryin', Fare thee, Titanic, fare the well,
--- Unknown ---
Jack Johnson heard the mighty shock
Mighta seen him doin' the Eagle Rock
Cryin', Fare thee, Titanic, fare the well,
--- Unknown ---
When the women and children got to land,
Crying Lord have mercy on my man,
