------ I Have Danced ------
--- ALICE BEANE ---
I have danced with the first class, Edgar
It was oh, such a dream come true!
--- EDGAR BEANE ---
That class isn't for our kind, Alice...
--- ALICE BEANE ---
That won't do!
--- Unknown ---
There are hotels on islands, Edgar!
Great resorts on a sandy beach...
--- EDGAR BEANE ---
That's a world that's beyond our income
And our reach...
--- ALICE BEANE ---
Please don't tell me never
I'll want this forever...ever...
--- Unknown ---
There's a new world around us, Edgar
--- EDGAR BEANE ---
Won't you ever give up that view?
--- ALICE BEANE ---
I want more than we've got now, Edgar
