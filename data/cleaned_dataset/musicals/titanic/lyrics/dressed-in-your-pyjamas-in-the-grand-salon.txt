1ST CLASS PASSENGERS
Strange and quite disorienting being here...
Recently awakened from a dream...
How the lights burn,
Every crystal bright as a star!
--- Unknown ---
Dressed in you pyjamas in the Grand salon,
Looks to be bizarre in the extreme...
Things could improve if the steward opens the bar!
--- Unknown ---
Oh...it's a memory I'll want to keep
Now..I would like to go
Back to sleep...
--- Unknown ---
Dressed in your pyjamas in the grand salon
Wondering if things are what they seem
Can you be sure? Do you ever
Know where you are?
--- ETCHES ---
Mr. Astor please, your life-belt
Mr. Guggenheim, please put it on now...
Captain's orders
Ladies and gentlemen, wear your life-belts!
--- Unknown ---
Mrs. Widener, if you would m'am
Mr. Thayer, we must insist now
It's a mere formality
There is no cause for concern
--- ETCHES & STEWARDS ---
We'll be on our way!
We hardly need stay now...
In a moment or two she'll be right again
Travelling west!
--- JOHN THAYER ---
See here, Mr. Etches, I demand to know exactly what's happening!
--- ETCHES ---
The latest word, sir, seems to be that she's damaged one
of the wing propellers and we could be delayed for an entire
day, sir.
--- THAYER ---
I don't like the way this sounds...
--- BANJAMIN GUGGENHEIM ---
Not a bit, not a bit, not a little bit...
--- THAYER ---
We spent eighteen hundred pounds
--- GUGGENHEIM ---
Not a bit, not a bit, not a little bit...
--- GUGGENHEIM & THAYER ---
This is not the sort of voayage we paid for!
I demand to know what the ship is delayed for!
Right now!
