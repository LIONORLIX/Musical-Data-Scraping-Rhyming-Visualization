------ Godspeed Titanic ------
--- COMPANY ---
Farewell, farewell
Godspeed, Titanic...
From your berth glide free!
As you plough the deep,
In your arms I'll keep.
Safely west
May you carry me.
--- Unknown ---
Sail on, sail on
Grest ship, Titanic...
Cross the open sea
Pray the journey's sound
Till your port be found
Fortune's winds
Sing Godspeed to thee...
--- Unknown ---
Fotune's winds
Sing Godspeed
