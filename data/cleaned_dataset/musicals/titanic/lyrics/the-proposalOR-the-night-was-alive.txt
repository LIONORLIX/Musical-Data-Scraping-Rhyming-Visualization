I was young and shy, detached and sad
Spent my days indoors, a home-bound lad
Hardly spoke, few friends
I kept myself to myself
Quite alone
--- Unknown ---
Then I found Marconi's Telegraph
It couls span the planrt's width by half
Fifty yards, two thousand miles
The same!
Touch the spark...sound the tone
--- Unknown ---
And the night was alive
With a thousand voices
Fighting to be heard
And each and every one of them
Connected to me...
--- Unknown ---
And my life cam alive
With a thousand voices
Tapping out each word
Like a thousand people
Joined with a single heartbeat
--- Unknown ---
Tapping out our Dit dit-dah-dit dah-dit
Dit dit-dah-dit dah-dit
Dit dit-dah-dit dah
Everywhere...

Watch over thee                 And every one of them
Connected to me

Marry me                        So alive with a thousand
Voices
May God's heaven be
Your blanket
As you sleep                    Those people
Joined with a single

Tapping out our Dit dit-dah-dit dah-dit
