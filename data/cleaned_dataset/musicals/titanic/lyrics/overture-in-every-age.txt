------ Overture In Every Age ------
--- ANDREWS ---
In every age mankind attempts
To fabricate great works
At once magnificent
And impossible...
--- Unknown ---
On desert sands, from mountains of stone
A pyramid!
From flying buttresses alone
A wall of light!
A chapel ceiling
Screaming one man's ecstasy!
One man's ecstasy...
--- Unknown ---
Miracles them all!
China's endless wall...
Stonehenge, The Parthenon, The Duomo
The aqueducts of Rome
--- Unknown ---
We did not attempt to make
With mammoth blocks of stone
A giant pyramid
No, not a pyramid...
Nor gothic walls that radiate with light...
--- Unknown ---
Our task was to dream upon
And then create
A floating city!
Floating city!...
--- Unknown ---
A human metropolis...
A complete civilization!
Sleek!
And fast!
At once a poem
And the perfection
Of physical engineering...
--- Unknown ---
At once a poem
And the perfection
