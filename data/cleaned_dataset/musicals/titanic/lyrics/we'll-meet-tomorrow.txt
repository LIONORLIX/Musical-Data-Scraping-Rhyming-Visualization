------ We'll Meet Tomorrow ------
--- COMPANY ---
We'll meet tomorrow
We will find a path
And reach tomorrow.
Past this day of wrath
We'll be together once again
Cling to your hope and prayers till then...
--- BARRETT ---
I'll hold thee closely
As I say goodbye
And keep your image
In my memory's eye
And all this love of ours will soar
Come dawn or danger
We'll meet tomorrow
And have each other evermore
--- COMPANY ---
Give us tomorrow
And another hour
Let our reunion
Come within our power...
Grant one more chance
To make a start
That we may live for
As we part...
--- CHARLES CLARKE ---
COme say you love me
As I kiss your eyes
Let one brief moment
Make eternal ties...
--- COMPANY ---
If tomorrow is not in store
Let this embracing
Replace forever
Keep us together
