My dear Mr. Latimer!
Prepare to greet out clientele
Our meeting is imminent
Our having just rung the dinner bell
It won't be a novelty
We mostly have seen them all before...
--- Unknown ---
Prepare for the usual
You should be aware of what's in store...
We've served them on the Baltic
And the Oceanic,
Olympic and Majestic
And today's the same
There's nothing changed...

Mr. Astor takes his toast dry
Mrs. Straus likes the grouse
With the sauce on the side
And the Wideners love Kidney pie
Bring it hot, if it's not
They'll be fit to be tied
They're accustomed to the best
Of all that money buys
The world of free enterprise
Has given this privilege to the rich...
--- Unknown ---
When they're idle
They're entitled to the luxury
Which we provide
That's forever the source of out pride...
Which is why we're always there
With our especial form of care
For evey hungry millionaire
By now they've all arrived...

Where wer seat the elite whom we happily serve
Here they dine on fine French cuisine
It's the Creme de la Creme's
Exclusive preserve!

To be where the Captain sits
When taking their dinner on the sea
Giving deference to their preferences is our greatest art!

In a perfectly worling machine

This is a privilege great and rare
A special burden that we bear
In our respective lives!
