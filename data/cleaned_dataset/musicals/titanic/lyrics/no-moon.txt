------ No Moon ------
--- FLEET ---
No moon
No wind
Nothing to spy things by
No wave
No swell
No line where sea meets sky
Stillness
Darkness
Can't see a thing, says I
No reflection
Not a shadow
Not a glint of light
Meets the eye...
--- Unknown ---
And we go sailing
Sailing
Ever westward on the sea
We go sailing
Sailing
Ever on
Go we...
--- IDA STRAUS ---
It's a beautiful night, Mr. Straus
Even though there's no moon
Look at all the stars
Can you find the big dipper?
--- ISIDOR STRAUS ---
The big dipper? I can't even find our own stateroom.
Every time I go out for a walk, finding my way back is
an adventure.
--- IDA STRAUS ---
Maybe you drop some bread crumbs
--- ISIDOR STRAUS ---
Can you feel how cold it's getting, Mrs. Straus?
All in the past couple of hours
Would you like me to get your fur stole?
--- IDA STRAUS ---
What, and maybe never see you again?
No thank you, I'd rather freeze
--- JIM FARRELL ---
Are you cold, then, Katie?
--- KATE MCGOWAN ---
Not now that you've got your arm around me...
--- JIM FARRELL ---
But I don't-
Oh, you're a funny one, Kate Mcgowan.
--- KATE MCGOWAN ---
Funny? T'anks very much.
--- JIM FARRELL ---
Becasue you come right out with what you want.
--- KATE MCGOWAN ---
And you find that funny, do you?
What kind of girl do you think I am?
You think I need to be told what I want?
Life's too short for that, me boy-o
--- CAPT. SMITH ---
The weather's quite changed, Mr. Lightoller
--- LIGHTOLLER ---
Yes, Sir, it's turned very cold
Only one point above freezing
--- MURDOCH ---
Ocean temperature's  down to thirty-one degrees, Captain
--- CAPT. SMITH ---
Warn the carpenter to check our supply of fresh water,
Mr. Murdoch
-and tell the engine room to watch the steam winches.
--- MURDOCH ---
Aye, aye, sir
--- CAPT. SMITH ---
There's not much wind, is there?
--- LIGHTOLLE ---
No, Sir. It appears to be a flat calm.
--- FLEET                          SMITH,LIGHTOLLER,MURDOCH ---
...And we go sailing           See how calm it is
Sailing
Smooth as polished glass
Ah, the open sea
Ever westward
On the sea
Feel the bite in the air
...We go sailing
Sailing                        Ah, the open sea
Smooth as polished glass
Ever on
Go we...
--- CAROLINE NEVILLE ---
Charles, think!
In two days, America!
What's the first thing your going to do when we get there, darling?
After Marrying me, of course-
--- CHARLES CLARKE ---
Apply to the sports desk of an important New York newspaper.
I'm sure that they can use a journalist with my experience.
--- CAROLINE NEVILLE ---
Oh, darling, you're sure to be a success!
--- CHARLES CLARKE ---
Let us both hope so...
--- BOTH ---
That's why we're going there...
--- MRS. CARDOZA ---

--- THE MAJOR ---

--- MRS. CARDOZA ---
So I see.
--- J.J. ASTOR ---
Women are never permitted in the 1st calss Smoke Room, madam.
--- MRS. CARDOZA ---
Don't look so shocked, gentlemen. There's a new world out there.
--- THE MAJOR ---
There's a new world out where?
--- MRS. CARDOZA ---
Mr. Hartley, that's a new melody- what's it called?
--- HARTLEY ---
