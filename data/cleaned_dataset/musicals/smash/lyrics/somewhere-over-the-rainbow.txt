------ Somewhere Over The Rainbow ------
--- Unknown ---
When all the clouds darken up the skyway
There's a rainbow highway to be found
Leading from your window pane
To a place behind the sun
Just a step beyond the rain
--- Unknown ---
Somewhere over the rainbow
Way up high
There's a land that I heard of
Once in a lullaby
--- Unknown ---
Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me
Where troubles melt lemon drops
Away above the chimney tops
That's where you'll find me
--- Unknown ---
Somewhere over the rainbow
Bluebirds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then oh why can't I
--- Unknown ---
If happy little bluebirds fly
Beyond the rainbow
