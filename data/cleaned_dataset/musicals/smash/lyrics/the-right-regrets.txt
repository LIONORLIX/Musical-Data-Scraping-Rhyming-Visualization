------ The Right Regrets ------
--- Unknown ---
A writer has the empty page
Where he can set the scene
He puts the actors on the stage
Or on the movie screen
--- Unknown ---
The characters all say the words
The writer wants to hear
And then, my friend
A happy end
--- Unknown ---
But when the writer steps outside
That room where he is king
He can't control when lives collide
Or what the lovers sing
--- Unknown ---
And so he hides behind his words
The one place he belongs
And in black and white
He can rewrite the wrongs
--- Unknown ---
Where he can find the strength to say
What those he loves should hear
And just erase mistakes she's made
Then make them disappear
--- Unknown ---
Where he can change the plot
So he's a hero, not a louse
And when the curtain falls
There's not a dry eye in the house
--- Unknown ---
A writer hopes to leave behind
A work no one forgets
And when he writes, the end
To find he has the right regrets
--- Unknown ---
A writer has the empty page
Where he can use his pen
To mend his heart
And try to start
