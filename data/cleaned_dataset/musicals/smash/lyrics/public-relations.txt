------ Public Relations ------
--- Reporters ---
Here she is!
Miss Marilyn Monroe
Will she have the answers
That our readers want to know?
From India and Pars
And from just across the pond
We have so many questions
For America's smart dumb blonde
--- Marilyn ---
Here I am
I dropped in from the sky
For Look and Life and all the boys
From Peek and U.P.I
--- Unknown ---
[Reporters] Please let us peek behind closed doors
Where no one is allowed!
[Marilyn] Well I'm pretty good in private
But the truth is, I'm better in a crowd
--- Unknown ---
I relate to men of so many nations
But public relations
Are my favorite kind
[Reporters] You're the story that we're glad we're assigned
--- Unknown ---
Dealing with one man
Can lead to frustrations
But public relations
I have never declined
[Reporters] Cause we're the guys who'll never leave ya behind
--- Unknown ---
A bunch of men
With pad and pen
Is a way to have some fun
But ladies, listen to me
Confidentially?
Nothing ever beats a one on one
--- Unknown ---
Still, you come to me
For sex in quotations
So I'll use public relations
To give you a piece of my mind
--- Reporters ---
Gimme, gimme
A piece of your mind
Cause the answer to a question
Is the way you're defined, like
--- Spoken ---
[Reporter:] What do you sleep in?
[Marilyn:] Well I adore Chanel No. 5 and not much more
[Reporter:] Any advice for a girl in the city?
[Marilyn:] If you're two-faced, at least make one of them pretty
[Reporter:] The studio says, lateness is your favorite crime
[Marilyn:] True, I've been on a calendar, but never on time
[Reporter:] When you posed nude, your inhibitions were gone?
[Marilyn:] Well, that's not quite true, I kept the radio on!
--- Sung ---
Yes, to chase the blues
Boys, I chase the newsboys!
Fame has plenty of perks
--- Unknown ---
When your life's a mess
Call the foreign press
Be they Indian, Parisian, British
German, or Turks
--- Unknown ---
I am glad you crave
My best conjugations
Yes, public relations
Is my favorite sound
--- Unknown ---
Cause when I'm alone
I can pick up the phone
Cause the forth estate
Is always around!
