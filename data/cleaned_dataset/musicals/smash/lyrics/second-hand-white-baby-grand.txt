------ Second Hand White Baby Grand ------
--- Unknown ---
My mother bought it secondhand from a silent movie star
It was out of tune but still I learned to play
And with each note we both would smile forgetting who we are
And all the pain would simply fly away
--- Unknown ---
Something secondhand and broken still can make a pretty sound
Even if it doesn't have a place to live
Oh, the words were left unspoken when my Mama came around
But that Secondhand White Baby Grand still had something beautiful to give
--- Unknown ---
Through missing keys and broken strings the music was our own
Until the day we said our last goodbyes
The baby grand was sent away
A child all alone, to pray somebody else would realize
That something secondhand and broken still can make a pretty sound
Even if it doesn't have a place to live
Oh, the words are still unspoken now that Mama's not around
But that Secondhand White Baby Grand still has something beautiful to give
--- Unknown ---
For many years the music had to roam
--- Unknown ---
Until we found a way to find a home
So now I wake up every day and see her standing there
Just waiting for a partner to compose
--- Unknown ---
And I wish my mother still could hear that sound beyond compare
I'll play her song till everybody knows
That something secondhand and broken still can make a pretty sound
Don't we all deserve a family room to live
Oh, the words can't stay unspoken until everyone has found
--- Unknown ---
That Secondhand White Baby Grand that still has something beautiful to give
