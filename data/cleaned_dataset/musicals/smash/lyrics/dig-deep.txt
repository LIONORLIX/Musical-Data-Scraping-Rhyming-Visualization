------ Dig Deep ------
--- Unknown ---
Use the past
Use your pain
Never ever try to entertain
Let Stanislavsky be your umbrella
Mumble your words!
Unless they're...
Stella!
Use justification, improvisation
Plus some emotional masturbation
Visitor from the Western coast!
Can you dig it
I dig it the most!

In history there's this doctrine called Monroe
which basically told the enemy where to go
It was created to nurture and protect
But now a new Monroe doctrine is in effect
So go tell Mr. Zanuck to read it and weep
'Cause I'm not just here to dig
I'm here to dig deep
From the 20th century Foxholes I'm released
And just like the sun, I'm rising in the east
I made a move from that permanent state of sadness
To prove there's a method to my madness
I'm waking up from that 20th century sleep
I'm not just here to dig
I'm here to dig deep
Well there ain't no sin to remove your skin
And to take a look under the hood
Mm-hmm
Well you must dispel the outer shell
Though you have to admit my shell looks good
You're tearing me apart!
I'll finally get to use my mind's interior
And not only just my bust and my posterior
'Cause the true inner self you can't avoid
And we're just nuts about Sigmund Freud
So open up my id for a good clean sweep
'Cause I'm not just here to dig
No, I'm not just here to dig
Oh, I'm not just here to dig
I'm here to dig deep
Motivation, concentration, exploration
So Deep!
