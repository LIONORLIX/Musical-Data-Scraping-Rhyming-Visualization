Come and turn me on baby
Be my man
Tell me what you what you
What you, what you waiting for?

Touch Me
I want to feel you on my body,
Put your hands on me
Come on and love me (love me)
If you wanna get it boy
Give 'til the count of three
Come on closer I don't want to take it slow.
I wanna go somewhere we can be alone
Everymove that I could make
There's much more than I can take
--- Unknown ---
Touch me
I want to feel your body
