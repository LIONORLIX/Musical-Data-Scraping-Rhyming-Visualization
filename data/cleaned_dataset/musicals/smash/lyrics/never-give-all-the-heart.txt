------ Never Give All the Heart ------
--- Unknown ---
As a girl, I lived in a million homes
So I always would keep to myself
And my lessons were learned
From the stories and poems
I would steal from a library shelf
--- Unknown ---
Yes, the books like the Roots
Weren't mine to keep
But the words weren't left behind
And I think of them all and I can't sleep
And a poet who read my mind
--- Unknown ---
As the wise men once wrote
Never give all the heart
Well, it's easy to see
He was writing for me
I just wish I could play that part
--- Unknown ---
Yes, he scribbled that love isn't worth thinking of
That is fades out from kiss to kiss
If I just learned those lines
Well, just think of the misery I'd miss
--- Unknown ---
As the Irish men said
Don't put your heart up to play
When he warned of the cost
And the heart that he lost
Mister Yeats really paved the way
--- Unknown ---
For the men that I've known
Who have clearly shown
They've reading him from the start
'Cause when it comes to me
Well, their kisses come free
But they never give all the heart
--- Unknown ---
When he warned of the cost
And the heart that he lost
Mister Yeats really paved the way
--- Unknown ---
For the men that I've known
Well, they've clearly shown
They been reading him from the start
'Cause each time that I fall
They never give all the heart
