------ Cut, Print...Moving On ------
--- Unknown ---
I know I made you mad
But this time that we've spent creating
Was the best time I ever had
--- Unknown ---
Now I love to sit with mem'ries
But they won't come until we're gone
--- Unknown ---
So give me a kiss
And cut, print...moving on
--- Unknown ---
Tell me a brand new story
Together, we'll turn the page
The grass is always greener
On some new technicolor stage
--- Unknown ---
And if a duckling never swims
She'll never become a swan
Yes, I'm diving in
So cut, print...moving on
--- Unknown ---
Yes, there have been nights I'll long to relive
But sometimes you gotta roam
You can't fight when something's gotta give
But you'll always be my home away from home
--- Unknown ---
Now, I like to play a love scene
But don't let it last too long
Play me the eight bar intro
Of some new lush romantic song
--- Unknown ---
I'm not afraid to take that leap
With you to depend upon
Now, tell me your name?
Cut, print...moving on
--- Unknown ---
We told the same jokes
We breathed the same air
We couldn't tell night from day
But just like the end of a love affair
We all know the time comes to break away
--- Unknown ---
Last year, we all were strangers
This year, we're lifelong friends
I know that this location
Is not where our story ends
--- Unknown ---
Get up cause the rat race never ends
This life is a marathon
And I plan to run so much more than a sprint
What's next? Well, I can't even give you a hint
--- Unknown ---
But boys, that's a wrap
So, cut! Print!
Moving on!
And on!
Moving on!
