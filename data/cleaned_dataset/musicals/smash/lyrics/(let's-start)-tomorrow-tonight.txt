------ (Let's Start) Tomorrow Tonight ------
--- Unknown ---
Round and round goes the wheel of love
Some say like Russian roulette
There's a jackpot I'm dreaming of
I'm ready to place my bet
--- Unknown ---
No need to beg, steal or borrow
The future is looking bright
Yes, I'm laying odds on tomorrow
So let's start tomorrow tonight
--- Unknown ---
Can't cha feel, baby, we're in the chips
Tomorrow's our lucky day
I can feel gold at our fingertips
We'll prosper if we parlay
--- Unknown ---
No time for sadness and sorrow
Together, we'll fight that fight
Yes, I'm laying odds on tomorrow
So let's start tomorrow tonight
--- Unknown ---
Don't need no clover or lucky charm
That rabbit can keep his foot
As long as we're walkin' arm in arm
It's aces, I feel
So shut up and deal!
--- Unknown ---
I know that we're on a winning streak
The future can't come too soon
Let's climb together to reach that peak
Then baby, we'll shoot the moon
--- Unknown ---
I'm high as Kilimanjaro
And with you, Jack, I'm ready for flight
Yes, I'm laying odds on tomorrow
So let's start tomorrow tonight
--- Unknown ---
As long as we're walkin' arm in arm
It's aces, I feel!
So shut up and deal!
Oh, I know that we're on a winning streak
The future can't come too soon
--- Unknown ---
Let's climb together to reach that peak
Then baby, we'll shoot the moon
I'm high as Kilimanjaro
And with you, Jack, I'm ready for flight
--- Unknown ---
Yes, I'm laying odds on tomorrow
So let's start tomorrow tonight
