------ At Your Feet ------
--- Unknown ---
Darling every Saturday it's our tradition
I give you a nickel for a day's admission
Then mommy has to run
Ah, but that won't stop your fun
Cause you get to see whose shoes you fit
Hey, Grauman! Can you babysit?
--- Spoken ---
[Young Norma Jeane:] Mom, do you have to leave me alone here?
[Gladys:] Norma Jeane, you know I have to work and what do you mean alone?
This place is full of people!
And not just people, stars! Nothing bad could ever happen to you here!
--- Sung ---
Some folks wish on stars above
They want money, fame and love
We like our stars more concrete
So the stars that you're wishin' on are
At your feet
--- Unknown ---
Some like night to dream what's not
We prefer this sunny spot
To see the light, and feel the heart
When the stars that you're wishin' on are
At your feet
--- Unknown ---
I have to work each Saturday
So my baby sees the matinee
You watch the movie, then rush out
And put your left foot and your right foot in
And shake those dreams about
--- Unknown ---
Most girls dream to touch the sky
Wide awake is when we fly
Down the boulevard
Where it's hard to not feel high
Where you hear the song, and feel the beat
Cause the stars that you're wishin' on are
At your feet
--- Spoken ---
[Gladys:] Now go on, Norma Jeane, go see whose hands match yours!
[Young Norma Jeane:] Momma, who's your favorite?
--- Sung ---
Mary Pickford, Clara Bow
Their impressions make a show
And you're in a front row seat
Where the stars that you're wishin' on are
At your feet
--- Unknown ---
Tap in time with Fred Astaire
Maybe someday, you'll be there
Ginger Rogers, can't compete
When the stars that you're wishin' on are
At your feet
--- Unknown ---
We don't watch the skies for a star's ascent
We prefer a square of wet cement
With famous names that fill the screen
And maybe someday one will spell out
Norma Jeane!
Maybe someday one will spell out
Norma Jeane!
--- Unknown ---
It's showtime, let the dream begin
With each star who's ever been
Step inside the footsteps that you should follow in
--- Unknown ---
So, I leave you in the best of hands
In this most Chinese of wonderlands
Your dreams will truly be complete
When the stars that you're wishin' on are
At your feet!
