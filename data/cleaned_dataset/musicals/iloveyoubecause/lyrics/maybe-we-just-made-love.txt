------ Maybe We Just Made Love ------
--- AUSTEN ---
I can`t let my romantic side get the better of me
We`re just friends who really like one another
We just happen to end up doing what two really good friends do
Like a crossword
Or a puzzle
Or each other
Things aren`t any different now than they ever were before
This doesn`t mean` It couldn`t mean anything more
--- Unknown ---
After Katherine, I never thought I could feel this way again
She was my one and only and of those there can be only one
But then, what do I make of Katherine, who forgets what we had back then`
I was her one and only, but now it`s ended, it`s over, it`s done
--- Unknown ---
Maybe I`m stupid
To hold on now to this ideal
And maybe I`m crazy
To feel the things that I now feel
But maybe with Marcie, I`ve found something real
Maybe, maybe, maybe
Maybe we just made love
--- Unknown ---
But it can`t be right, there`s no way I could`ve recovered so fast
She must just be a rebound, even Jeff said so and he`s right
I`m just setting myself up yet again for flawed romance that will never last
This will never work out. What do I know` Who knows` It might`
--- Unknown ---
Maybe I`m foolish
And deserve the pain that all this brings
And maybe she`s using me
And I`m imagining all these things
Or maybe it`s a puppet show and I`m failing to see all the strings
Maybe, maybe, maybe
Maybe we just made love
--- Unknown ---
How can a feeling strong
Be wrong`
It can`t
Emotion this pure must be right
How can ignoring my gut be
The best thing to do`
It can`t
I need her
And I`m gonna tell her so tonight
--- Unknown ---
Maybe I`m missing
My whole life and can`t see what`s at stake
Or maybe I`m reckless
And fell running right toward more heartache
Maybe I`m wrong and we just made a huge mistake
But maybe, maybe, maybe
I`m definitely positive
Maybe, maybe, maybe
Yes! I`ve never been more certain
Maybe, maybe, maybe
Maybe we just made love
We just made love
We just made love
We just made love
