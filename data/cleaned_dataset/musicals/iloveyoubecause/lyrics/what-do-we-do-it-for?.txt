------ What Do We Do It For? ------
--- N Y WOMAN ---
Somewhere there are birds
Singing sweet lovely songs
And a guy tells a girl
In her arms he belongs
People say you`ll find the one
If you just look, we guarantee
Well I`ve looked and looked and looked and looked
But there`s no one for me
--- N Y MAN ---
Don`t I know it.
I`ve searched this whole island
Queens and Brooklyn, even Hoboken
But for some of us
Our only true guarantee
Is that our hearts get broken
--- N Y WOMAN ---
Jersey`
--- N Y MAN ---
I got on the wrong train.
--- Unknown ---
Back in the first grade,
I knew this girl.
There was some magic in the notes that we passed
One day, while playin` in the sand
I made a move to hold her hand.
She said `I think that things are movin` too fast.`
--- DIANA ---
Huh. Tease.
--- N Y MAN ---
Yeah.
--- N Y WOMAN ---
One time in high school,
I had a crush.
So I thought I`d ask him out to the prom.
But he said, `you know what honey`
Though you`re charming and you`re funny,
I love you the way a boy loves his mom.`
--- MARCY ---
That`s not good
--- ENSEMBLE ---
Oh, why do we do it`
Continue to pursue it`
When it ends up hurting us to the core`
--- N Y WOMAN ---
It`s because,
though it sounds corny,
you feel love,
--- N Y MAN ---
Or you feel horny.
--- ENSEMBLE ---
What do we do it for`
--- MARCY ---
At least it got better when we got older
--- N Y WOMAN AND DIANA ---
Right.
--- N Y MAN ---
Yeah right.
--- Unknown ---
I had this good friend
That I loved for years
One day I thought the situation must end
So I said, `I love you truly,`
And she responded coolly,
`Oh, I love you too, but just as a friend.`
--- DIANA ---
Don`t be friends.
--- N Y WOMAN ---
I met this great guy
Right here at this bar.
And we talked and talked and talked about life
And he said, `my God, you`re pretty,
and you`re interesting, and you`re witty.
You know you remind me a lot of my wife.`
--- N Y MAN ---
Sing it girls!
--- ENSEMBLE ---
Why do we do it`
There must be something to it.
That keeps us coming right back for more.
--- MARCY ---
This thing love,
It keeps me guessing
--- DIANA ---
This is getting damn depressing
--- ENSEMBLE ---
What do we do it for`
--- N Y WOMAN ---
We try and try and try and try.
It`s as if the gods up in the sky hate us.
--- DIANA ---
Sing Child
--- N Y MAN ---
It`s now so bad that I
Am going on a dating hiatus.
--- N Y WOMAN ---
Oh, I hear you.
--- Unknown ---
I think there is a curse,
--- MARCY ---
You know, I`m certain of it because
--- DIANA ---
Testify
--- N Y WOMAN ---
Just when it can`t get worse-
look at here
--- DIANA ---
Fuck me
--- ENSEMBLE ---
It does!
--- N Y MAN ---
I`ll just wait here alone at this bar
With each drink,
it`s more depressing and sad.
--- N Y WOMAN ---
Maybe I should give up dating
`Cause I feel like I`m just waiting
For a guy to say,
`You look like my dad.`
--- ENSEMBLE ---
Oh`
--- Unknown ---
We keep at it,
Even though we`ve had it,
And the signs are getting hard to ignore.
--- MARCY ---
They`re all saying
`Haha, got you.
--- DIANA ---
Love`s for people
who are not you.`
--- ENSEMBLE ---
What do we do it for`
--- N Y MAN ---
Alright. You ladies want another round`
Okay. We`ll just take it out of her tips.
--- Unknown ---
Yes, but then again,
You just never know.
In a moment he might walk through that door.
--- MARCY ---
And he`d stop my heart from sinking
--- DIANA ---
And my head from over-thinking.
--- ENSEMBLE ---
That`s what we do it for.
That`s why we do it,
Why we put our poor selves through it.
That`s what we do it
For`
--- DIANA ---
Marcy, let`s go.
