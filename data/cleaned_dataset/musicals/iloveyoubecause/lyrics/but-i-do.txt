------ But I Do ------
--- Diana ---
He hurt me hard
He won`t commit
He doesn`t believe in love, not even a little bit
I`m questioning the things I thought I knew to be true
I don`t know why I love him,
But I do
Marcy:
I wanted him
Cause he was wrong
I`m not certain how, but with him now
Is where I belong
He's an idiot
And a stuffed shirt
And a Republican too
I don`t know why I love him,
but I do
Jeff:
She`s like every woman I ever met, who says casual`s ok
But they don`t mean what they say
There`s nothing special about her
What does she look like` I forget.
I`m certain I`m better off without her
I don`t need her anyway.
Marcy and (Austin):
I wanted him (Found my love from before)
Cause he was wrong (Then she knocks on my door)
I`m not certain how (with a pout), but with him now (and teary eyes),
is where I belong (that work on weaker men)
Austin:
I tried to keep my feelings from bubbling up again
Marcy:
I don`t know why I love him
Austin:
I don`t need her anyway
Marcy:
But I do
Marcy and Diana (Austin and Jeff):
Why as soon as you`re comfortable (as soon as you know where you stand)
You know who you are, you`ve figured it out
All:
You`re sure of your ways
You feel solid and strong
Then someone comes in and shows you that you`re wrong
Marcy and Diana:
Why can`t I explain` (Austin: She`s only a woman)
This aching pain` (Jeff: there will be other women)
All:
I`m barley surviving why is she/he driving me insane` (Jeff: I don`t need that woman)
All I know says I should leave her/him and go find someone new`
Marcy and Diana (Austin and Jeff):
I don`t know why I love him (I don`t need her anyway)
Diana:
But I do`
Jeff:
But I do`
Marcy:
But I do`
