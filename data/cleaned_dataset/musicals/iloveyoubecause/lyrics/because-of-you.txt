------ Because Of You ------
--- AUSTIN ---
Wow.
I let myself feel feelings I don`t usually allow.
Ah, it felt exciting.
It felt scary.
None of my vocabulary can do justice to the way I feel right now.
--- Unknown ---
Did you see the look on that guy`s face when we took the crap with us`
--- MARCY ---
`That`s not your wine! I`m an angry waiter, bleh`
--- AUSTIN ---
--- Unknown ---
I took off and sprinted straight through town.
When you got screwed,
I didn`t take it sitting down.
I did all sorts of things I wouldn`t usually do.
And it`s all because  of you.
Because of you.
Because of you.
--- MARCY ---
You just brought that restaurant to its knees.
Now the whole world knows that waiter`s not Chinese.
I didn`t have to pay them for my se won tofu.
And it`s all because of you.
Because of you.
Because of you.
--- AUSTIN ---
Because of you, I acted out of line.
--- MARCY ---
Because of you, we just stole some free boxed wine.
--- AUSTIN ---
Because of you I acted bravely
--- MARCY ---
And a little infantile.
--- MARCY & AUSTIN ---
Because of you I feel a way I have not felt in awhile.
--- AUSTIN ---
I can`t believe that I got in a drunken fight.
--- MARCY ---
You stood up for me,
But it was impolite.
Tonight I had a good time,
And that`s a little disconcerting.
--- AUSTIN ---
Tonight,
For just a moment,
I forgot that I was hurting.
--- Unknown ---
Tonight I felt free.
--- MARCY ---
You know, I sort of felt that too.
--- AUSTIN ---
And it`s all because`
--- MARCY ---
It`s all because`
