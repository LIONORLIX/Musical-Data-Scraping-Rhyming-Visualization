------ Marcy's Yours ------
--- DIANA ---
I know you're hurt
And right now you want to do
What comes easy
And not risk what seems secure.
You can insert Katharine
Right into your ideal life
But is that what you're lookin' for`
Easy might be easy, but you want more.
--- Unknown ---
We all need someone
Who makes us question what we know
Who'll stretch your limits
If you don't stretch you'll never grow.
We all need someone who can open up new doors.
Jeff is mine.
Marcy's yours.
--- JEFF ---
When we first met
I just wanted to get in her pants.
But after awhile
I still wanted to get in her pants.
But then I got in her pants
And I wondered
What if I gave this a chance`
Nothing could have prepared me
For the way I felt, the way it scared me.
--- Unknown ---
We all need someone
Who will see that we're bizarre
And love us anyway
Cause they see who we really are.
I was lost in a canoe
I needed someone I loved to bring me oars.
Diana's mine.
Marcy's yours.
--- DIANA ---
What did you just say`
--- JEFF ---
It was just a stupid metaphor.
--- DIANA ---
No, you said you loved me.
--- JEFF ---
I did. You're the person I want to be better for.
--- DIANA ---
You'd better have meant it.  And it better not be just an accidental blunder.
--- JEFF ---
Bull.  I meant it.
--- DIANA ---
You did`
--- JEFF ---
And it feels wonderful.
--- DIANA ---
We all need someone
--- BOTH ---
Who admits that we're odd
And loves us anyway.
'Cause they see through our facade
--- DIANA ---
You finally feel as though you've got your ducks all in a line.
--- JEFF ---
They're wrong for you, even so, their voice sends shivers down your spine.
--- BOTH ---
You try to keep them out
But they know to look through the tarnish
Right to the shine.
--- DIANA ---
Jeff.
--- JEFF ---
Diana.
--- BOTH ---
I'm yours.
--- AUSTIN ---
Marcy's mine.
