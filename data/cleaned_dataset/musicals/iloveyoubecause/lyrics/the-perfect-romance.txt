------ The Perfect Romance ------
--- MALE ---
She gives suggestions
He`d rather skip
--- FEMALE ---
She left a fifty
--- MALE ---
He didn`t tip
--- BOTH ---
His style is truly tragic
Hers is tragically hip
The perfect romance
--- MALE ---
He likes things simple
--- FEMALE ---
But she`s complex
--- MALE ---
He follows structures
--- FEMALE ---
Which she rejects
He`s really only with her
`Cause he want back his ex
--- BOTH ---
The perfect romance
--- MALE ---
They couldn`t be
Less suited for each other
--- FEMALE ---
I completely agree
But don`t you see
That that`s what makes them perfect
For one another
--- MALE ---
She`ll try to teach him
All that she knows
--- FEMALE ---
Their good intentions-
--- MALE ---
Oh! What are those`
They quickly all go back
But, sadly that`s how it goes
--- BOTH ---
The perfect romance
The perfect romance
The perfect romance
