------ That's What's Gonna Happen ------
--- JEFF ---
The two of us, we`ll start off caring
All about this life we`re sharing
You and I
We`ll be high
Upon the fumes of luh-uh-ove
You`ll laugh at my jokes
We`ll be as sweet as two cherry cokes
And that`s, that`s what`s gonna happen
--- DIANA ---
Sounds wounderful
--- JEFF ---
Then I`ll take you out to dinner
All the while my wallets thinner
And I`ll yell
Where the hell
Did all my money go-oh-oh
But I`ll put off everything
So I can save for a three-karat ring
And that`s, that`s what`s gonna happen
--- DIANA ---
I don`t care about stuff like that`
--- JEFF ---
And I`ll be sure
That`s what I`m for
Cause you bring me a joy
I can`t buy or sell
But one night you`ll ask
`Do you still love me`
Cause sometimes I can`t quite tell!`
--- DIANA ---
And how do you know`
--- JEFF ---
So then I`m caught in this quandary
Cause I touched your dirty laundry
But that stuff
Is not enough
For you to know I care-air-air
Inside I`ll blow like a bomb
But outside, outside I`ll stay calm
And that`s, that`s what`s gonna happen
--- DIANA ---
Well, maybe if you opened up more`
--- AUSTEN AND MALE ---
But then one fateful day
--- JEFF ---
Thanks guys [`]
--- AUSTEN AND MALE ---
He`ll try to walk away
--- JEFF ---
That`s right
--- AUSTEN AND MALE ---
Despite
--- JEFF ---
My best givings
--- MALE ---
Second thoughts
--- JEFF ---
And fear-
--- JEFF, AUSTEN, MALE ---
Ear-ears
--- AUSTEN AND MALE ---
Then he`ll claim
--- JEFF ---
It`s me not you
--- MALE ---
Though we all know that that`s not true
--- Unknown ---
(Diana giggles)
--- JEFF ---
Then you`ll look at me and burst into tears
To your
--- JEFF, AUSTEN, MALE ---
Surprise
--- JEFF ---
I`ll stop and listen
Cause no guy
Wants to make a girl cry
--- Unknown ---
MALE [`]
Boo-
--- Unknown ---
AUSTEN [`]
Hoo
--- JEFF ---
But then you`ll cry every day
I`ll pretend it`s a phase
And then I'll freak out and end it
--- MALE ---
Aw
--- JEFF ---
Sadly that`s how this all ends
You will go and tell all your friends
--- JEFF, AUSTEN, MALE ---
I must be gay
--- JEFF ---
To
--- JEFF, AUSTEN, MALE ---
Walk away
--- JEFF ---
From a perfect girl like you
Now your friends all hate me too
But I just did what all men do
--- AUSTEN AND MALE ---
That`s true
--- JEFF ---
And that`s, that`s what`s gonna happen
--- MALE ---
It`ll fuck everything up.
--- JEFF ---
Now I`m broke and feel betrayed
--- AUSTEN AND MALE ---
And he`s not even getting laid
--- JEFF ---
That sucks
And that`s, that`s what`s gonna happen
--- Unknown ---
AUSTEN [`]
Come on Jeff. Bring us home.
--- JEFF ---
I know our relationship`s illusive
But, it is better than being exclusive
--- JEFF, AUSTEN, MALE ---
And that`s, that`s what`s gonna happen
Gonna happen, yeah
