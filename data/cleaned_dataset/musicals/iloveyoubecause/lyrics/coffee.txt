--- MARCY ---
If I added cream to your coffee,
You`d have a panic attack.
Just add a little cream,
Just a little dab of cream
--- AUSTIN ---
No
--- MARCY ---
That`s why you take your coffee black.
--- Unknown ---
Oh, look at you and your thermos.
--- AUSTIN ---
What`
--- MARCY ---
The one over there on the floor.
Did you bring it from home`
You brought it from home`
You had it when you walked through the door!
--- AUSTIN ---
Big deal!
I know how I like my coffee
`Cause I`ve got ways I get things done.
I could sit here and list `em
`Cause I`ve got a system
And maybe it`s not crazy fun
But it works for me and my coffee.
It moves me right along
There`s a neat logic to it
It`s just how I do it.
If you think that it`s stupid,
You`re wrong.
--- Unknown ---
So Marcy, if you don`t mind, I really am incredibly busy right now`
--- MARCY ---
Freeze`
--- AUSTIN ---
What`
--- MARCY ---
Say cheese!
--- AUSTIN ---
So how do you take your coffee`
--- MARCY ---
Well that depends on when
--- AUSTIN ---
What`
--- MARCY ---
I ask the barista,
It`s up to the barista
--- AUSTIN ---
Don`t ever say `barista` again.
--- Unknown ---
Doesn`t he find out your favorites`
Oooo, doesn`t that hurt your device`
--- MARCY ---
No, he never does,
You know why he never does`
I never go to the same place twice.
--- AUSTIN ---
What`
--- MARCY ---
I never go to the same place twice!
--- AUSTIN ---
Yeah` But`.
--- MARCY ---
`Cause I know how I like my coffee.
And I`ve got ways to keep things new.
I am always exploring,
So life`s never boring,
Well, not as boring as you.
So being `crazy with coffee`
Is a useful skill to hone.
You don`t have to derive it.
Perhaps if you tried it,
You wouldn`t be drinking alone.
--- AUSTIN ---
I`m going to get Katherine back.
--- MARCY ---
Austin, she`s going to thing you`re insane.
--- Unknown ---
AUSTIN (on the phone)
Katherine,
Hi`
I`m fine.
Listen, I know things have been tough, I just want to say something:
Life is like a pickle.
It starts off smooth,
With no imperfections.
But as it ages,
Surrounded by other pickles,
It becomes something pregnant women crave.
And it craves them.
I love you.
Okay, sure, fine. Alright, yeah.
I`ll talk to you again soon.
Okay.
Bye.
--- Unknown ---
(To Marcy)
I`m sorry I made fun of your coffee.
You`re right, I`m wrong.
You`re smart, I`m dumb.
Oh, please be my cupid,
I`m hopeless, I`m stupid.
I`m worthless, no, I`m scum.
--- MARCY ---
And also you`re covered with coffee.
--- AUSTIN ---
I know`
--- MARCY ---
Stop flipping out, it`s all okay.
This isn`t that tragic.
I`ll help you,
I`m magic!
You just need to do what I say.
--- AUSTIN ---
Huh. I cannot believe you!
Thank you!
Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!
--- MARCY ---
I`ll call you tomorrow`
--- AUSTIN ---
I am going to write you a thank you card like you have never read.
