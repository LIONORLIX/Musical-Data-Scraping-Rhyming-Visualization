Autumn / Finale Act 1


HARTLEY

Autumn

Shall we all meet in the Autumn?

Golden and glowing by Autumn

Shae we still be best of friends?

Best of friends...



All through each languorous season

We ebb and flow

Romance, defying all reason

Will come, then go



Still, perhaps this Autumn

Love won't retreat in the Autumn

ALl that we have won't be past

...Won't be past



Let breezes blow

And turn cold

As we continue growing old

This Autumn

Love newly found

May yet last



MRS. CARDOZA

So what do you say, gentlemen? I happen to play an excellent

game of auction bridge. May I join you?



THE MAJOR

Where's your sense of occasion, madam?

I understand you've just lost your husband.



MRS. CARDOZA

Yes. But not at cards.



FLEET

Ahead we plow

Into the darkening night

Can't see the bow

How then the search

With only starlight?...



FLEET & PERSONNEL              PASSENGERS

No moon                        Autumn

No wind                        Shall we all meet in the

Nothing to spy things          Autumn?

By                             Golden and glowing, by

No wave                        Autumn

No swell                       Shall we still be best of friends

No line where sea              Best of friends?

Meets sky                      Best of friends...No wind



FLEET, PERSONNEL, PASSENGERS

Stillness, darkness

Can't see a thing, says I

No reflection

Not a shadow

Not a glint of light

Meets the eye



PASSENGERS                     FLEET, PERSONNEL

And we go sailing

See how calm it is

Sailing

Smooth as polished glass

Ever westward

Ah, the open sea                  On the sea, we go...

Feel the bite in the air

Sailing

Ah, the open sea

Sailing

Smooth as polished glass



ALL

Ever on go we...

No wind...
