------ Applause ------
--- BONNIE ---
What is it that we're living for?
Applause, Applause.
Nothing I know
brings on the glow
like sweet applause.
You're thinking you're through,
that nobody cares,
then suddenly you
hear it starting.
--- Unknown ---
And somehow you're in charge again
and it's a ball.
Trumpet's all sing
life seems to swing,
and you're the king of it all 'cause
you've had a taste of
the sound that says love:
Applause, applause, applause!
--- MAN ---
When I was eight,
I was in a school play.
I'll never forget it,
I had one line to say.
My big moment came, I said What ho, the prince!
My sister applauded.
I've been hooked ever since.

Beautiful, soaring,

Whatever you do you do
