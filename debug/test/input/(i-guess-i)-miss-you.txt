(I Guess I) Miss You


PATRICK

Never thought that I could ride so high

Without you

Everything I've got's so good

But not without you



And suddenly nothing feels quite right

Why does the sunshine feel like night?

I'm only pretending I'm alright

Without you



Now it's some macaroni without the cheese

Or peas in a pod without the peas

That's the way I feel when there's me

Without you



I...

I...

I... guess I miss you



SPONGEBOB

It doesn't really matter how high I climb

Without you

Oh, I can't enjoy this lonely view

When I'm without you



No one can make me laugh like you

Nobody turns my 1 to 2

Maybe that's why I feel so blue

Without you



Tell me, what's the apple without the pie?

Tell me, what's the French without the fry?

That's the way I feel

When I know I'm without you



SPONGEBOB & PATRICK

I... (I...)

I... (I...)

I... (I...) guess I miss you

I...

I...

I... guess I miss you



SPONGEBOB

Won't you get here, my friend?



PATRICK

Bring my sunshine back again



PATRICK & SPONGEBOB

'Cause life's no fun

When you don't come around



I... (I...)

I... (I...)

I... (I...) guess I miss you

I...

I...

I... guess I miss you

Oooh
