Welcome To My Party


Queenie

Hello kids!



Welcome to my party

Glad you stumbled in

Welcome to my party

(Baby where’s the ice?)

Who here’s up for dancin’?

Who here’s new?

Welcome to my party



(to Dolores)



Who the hell invited you?



You’re here because you love me.

Don’t I know it? Yeh I know.

You’re here because you love me

And cuz the booze is cheap

And the lowdown’s  low.



Welcome to my party.

You know what I need

Queenie’s up for jazzin’

Queenie’s up for anything

Tonight!



I gotta get my engines smokin’

I need it bad and God I need it

More

I needa lot of friendly strokin’

There ain’t no heaven

And there ain’t no hell

No turnin’ back

Daddy lock the door!

Welcome!



(Queenie dances’charming, seductive,

Dazzling, all. Nadine, who’s been

Mesmerized by Queenie since her

Entrance, places herself directly in

Queenie’s path)





Nadine

I always wanted to see the

lights of Broadway;

I always wanted to hear

The traffic roar-!



Queenie

What’s this?



Nadine

I’m Nadine. I’m Mae’s little sister

From Poughkeepsie. Can I have a sip?



Queenie

You wanna hang with Queenie?



(Nadine nods excitedly)



The creatures of the night

Have come here to play

We don’t need the light

And we don’t like the day

People like us

Gotta jazz till we drop

Cuz people like us

We don’t know when to stop-



I know how to party

show ya how it’s done

I’ll teach you how to party

Where the hell’s my ice?

You’ll remember this one

Queenie’s guarantee

Welcome to my party

Wanna get creamed?

Wanna get juiced?

Wanna get wild?

Follow me!

Follow me!

Follow me!
