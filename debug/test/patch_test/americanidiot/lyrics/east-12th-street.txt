THEO and GERARD
Well nobody cares well nobody cares
Does anyone care if nobody cares?
Well nobody cares well nobody cares
Does anyone care if nobody cares?
--- THEO ---
Jesus is filling out paperwork now
--- THEO and GERARD ---
At the facility on East 12th St.
--- THEO ---
He's not listening to a word now
--- THEO and GERARD ---
He's in his own world and he's day dreaming
--- THEO ---
He'd rather be doing something else now
--- THEO and GERARD ---
Like cigarettes and coffe with the underbelly
--- THEO ---
His life's on the line with anxiety now
--- THEO and GERARD ---
She had enough and he's had plenty
--- ALL ---
Somebody get me out of here
Anybody get me out of here
Somebody get me out of here
Get me the f*** right out of here.
--- JOHNNY ---
So far away
I don't want to stay
Get me outta here right now
I just wanna be free
Is there a possibility
Get me out of here right now
--- JOHNNY and WILL ---
This lifelike dream ain't for me
