--- WHATSERNAME ---
Where have all the bastards gone?
The underbelling stacks up ten high
The dummy failed the crash test
Collecting unemployment check
The flunky only along for the ride
--- Unknown ---
Where have all the riots gone
As the city's motto gets pulverized?
What's in love that's now in debt?
on your birth certificate
So strike the f***ing match
to light this fuse!
--- Unknown ---
The town bishop's and extortionist
And he don't even know that you exist
Standing still whe it's do or die
You better run for you f***ing life!
--- WHATSERNAME and WOMEN ---
It's not over till you're underground
It's not over before it's too late
This city's burning: It's not my burden
It's not over before it's too late
--- WHATSERNAME ---
There is nothing left to analyze
Where will all the martyrs go
When the virus cures itself?
And when will we all go when it's too late?
--- Unknown ---
No don't look ack?
You're not the Jesus of Suburbia
--- WHATSERNAME and WOMEN ---
The St. Jimmy is a figment of
Your father's rage and your mother's love
Made me the idiot America!
--- Unknown ---
It's not over 'till you're underground
It's not over before it's too late
This city's burning: It's not my burden
It's not over before it's too late

She said "I can't take this place,
I'm leaving it behind
She said I can't take this town,
