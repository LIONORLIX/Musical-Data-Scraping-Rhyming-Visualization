------ Good Riddance (Time of Your Life) ------
--- Unknown ---
Another turning point, a fork stuck in the road
Time grabs you by the wrist, directs you where to go
So make the best of this test, and don't ask why
It's not a question, but a lesson learned in time
--- Unknown ---
It's something unpredictable, but in the end is right,
I hope you had the time of your life.
--- Unknown ---
So take the photographs, and still frames in your mind
Hang it on a shelf in good health and good time
Tattoos of memories and dead skin on trial
For what it's worth it was worth all the while
--- Unknown ---
It's something unpredictable, but in the end is right,
I hope you had the time of your life.
--- Unknown ---
It's something unpredictable, but in the end is right,
I hope you had the time of your life.
--- Unknown ---
It's something unpredictable, but in the end is right,
