------ Boulevard Of Broken Dreams ------
--- Unknown ---
I walk a lonely road
The only one that I have ever known
Don't know where it goes
But it's home to me and I walk alone
I walk this empty street
On the boulevard of broken dreams
Where the city sleeps
And I'm the only one and I walk alone
--- Unknown ---
I walk alone
I walk alone
I walk alone
I walk a
--- Unknown ---
My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
Til then I walk alone
--- Unknown ---
I'm walking down the line
That divides me somewhere in my mind
On the borderline of the edge
And where I walk alone
Read between the lines of what's
Fucked up and everything's alright
Check my vital signs to know I'm still alive
And I walk alone
--- Unknown ---
I walk alone
I walk alone
I walk alone
I walk a
--- Unknown ---
My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
Til then I walk alone
--- Unknown ---
I walk alone
I walk a
--- Unknown ---
I walk this empty street
On the boulevard of broken dreams
Where the city sleeps
And I'm the only one and I walk a
--- Unknown ---
My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
