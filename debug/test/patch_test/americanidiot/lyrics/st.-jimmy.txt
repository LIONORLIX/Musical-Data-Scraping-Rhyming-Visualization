------ St. Jimmy ------
--- Johnny ---
St. Jimmy's coming down across the alleyway
Up on the boulevard like a zip gun on parade
Light of a silhouette, he's insubordinate
Coming at you on the count of one, two, one, two, three, four
--- St; Jimmy ---
My name is Jimmy and you'd better not wear it out
Suicide commando that your mama talked about
King of the forty thieves and I'm here to represent
The needle in the vein of the establishment
--- Unknown ---
I'm the patron saint of the denial
With an angel face and a taste for suicidal
--- Unknown ---
Cigarettes and Ramen and a little bag of dope
I am the son of a bitch and Edgar Allen Poe
Raised in the city in the halo of lights
Product of war and fear that we've been victimized
--- Unknown ---
I'm the patron saint of the denial
With an angel face and a taste for suicidal
--- Unknown ---
Are you talking to me?
I'll give you something to cry about
--- Unknown ---
St. Jimmy!
--- Unknown ---
My name is St. Jimmy I'm a son of a gun
I'm the one that's from the way outside
I'm a teenage assassin executing some fun
In the cult of the life of crime
--- Unknown ---
I really hate to say it but I told you so
So shut your mouth before I shoot you down, old boy
Welcome to the club and give me some blood
And the resident leader at the lost and found
--- Unknown ---
It's comedy and tragedy
It's St. Jimmy
And that's my name
------ fin ------
