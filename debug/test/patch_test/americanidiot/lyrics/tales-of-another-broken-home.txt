------ Tales of Another Broken Home ------
--- JOHNNY ---
To live and not to breathe
--- JOHNNY, TUNNY, and WILL ---
Is to die in tragedy
--- JOHNNY ---
To run, to run away
--- JOHNNY, TUNNY, and WILL ---
To find what you believe
And I leave behind
This hurricane of f***ing lies
--- JOHNNY ---
I lost my faith to this
--- JOHNNY, TUNNY, and WILL ---
This town that don't exist
--- JOHNNY ---
So I run
I run away
--- JOHNNY, TUNNY, and WILL ---
To find what I believe
And I leave behind
This hurricane of f***ing lies
And I walked this line
A million and one f***ing times
But not this time
--- HEATHER ---
I don't feel any shame
I won't apologize
When there ain't nowhere you can go
--- ALL ---
Running away from pain
When you've been victimized
Tales from another broken home
--- WILL ---
You're leaving
You're leaving
