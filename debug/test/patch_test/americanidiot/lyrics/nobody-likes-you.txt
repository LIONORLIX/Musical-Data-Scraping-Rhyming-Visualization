------ Nobody Likes You ------
--- WILL ---
I fell asleep while watching Spike TV
After ten cups of coffee
And you're still not here
Dreaming of a song
When something went wrong
But I can't tell anyone
'Cause no one's here
Left me here alone
When I should have stayed home
After 10 cups of coffee
I'm thinking
--- ALL ---
Where'd you go?
--- WILL ---
Nobody likes you
Everyone left you
--- ALL ---
Where'd you go?
--- WILL ---
They're all out without you
Havin' fun
--- ALL ---
Where'd you go?
--- WILL ---
Everyone left you
Nobody likes you
--- ALL ---
Where'd you go??
--- WILL ---
They're all out witout you
Havin' fun
--- ALL ---
