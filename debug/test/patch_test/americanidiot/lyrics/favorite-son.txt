------ Favorite Son ------
--- JOSHUA ---
He hit the ground running
--- WOMEN ---
At the speed of light
--- JOSHUA ---
The star was brightly shining
--- WOMEN ---
Like a neon light
--- JOSHUA ---
It's your favorite son
It's your favorite son
A fixture on the talkshows,
To the silver screen
From here to Colorado,
He's a sex machine
--- Unknown ---
It's your favorite son
It's your favorite son
But isn't it a drag?
Isn't it a drag?
Isn't it a drag?
its pretty but it's sad,
but isn't it a drag?
--- Unknown ---
A clean-cut All-American
Really ain't so clean
His royal auditorium
Is a murder scene
--- Unknown ---
It's your favorite son
It's your favorite son
But isn't it a drag?
Isn't it a drag?
Isn't it a drag?
It's pretty but it's sad,
but isn't it a drag?
--- Unknown ---
Well no one says it's fair
Turn a teenage lush
To a millionaire
--- Unknown ---
Now where's your f***ing champion?
On a panty raid
He's not the All-American
That you thought you paid
It's your favorite son
