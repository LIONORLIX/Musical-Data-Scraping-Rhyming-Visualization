------ Dearly Beloved ------
--- HEATHER ---
Dearly beloved, are you listening?
I can't rememer a word that you were saying
Are we demented? Or am I disturbed?
The space that's in-between insane and insecure
--- Unknown ---
Oh therapy, can you please fill the void?
Am I retarded or am I just overjoyed?
Nobody's perfect and I stand accused
