------ I Don't Care ------
--- JOHNNY ---
I don't care if you don't
--- WILL ---
I don't care if you don't
--- TUNNY ---
I don't care if you don't care
--- ALL ---
I don't care if you don't
I don't care if you don't
I don't care if you don't care, etc.
--- JOHNNY ---
Everyone is so full of shit
Born and raised by hypocrites
--- WILL ---
Hearts recycled but never saved
From the cradle to the grave
--- TUNNY ---
We are the kids of war and peace
From Anaheim to the Middle East
--- TUNNY and WILL ---
We are the stories and disciples of
--- ALL ---
The Jesus of Suburbia
Land of make-believe
And it don't believe in me
Land of make-believe and I don't believe
--- Unknown ---
JOHNNY, WILL, and TUNNY
And I don't care!
I don't care
I don't care
I don't care
I don't care
